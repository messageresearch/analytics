[48:51] we were sitting in the back
[48:53] when brother sean was here and he said

[53:54] hallelujah
[53:55] [Applause]
[53:57] hallelujah
[54:03] amen
[54:04] amen
[54:06] i want to speak this morning
[54:09] on
[54:10] satan
[54:12] couldn't touch
[54:13] a risen savior
[54:16] hallelujah if you will turn with me in
[54:19] your scriptures this morning to john
[54:21] chapter 20
[54:23] and verse 11
[54:25] john chapter 20
[54:27] and verse 11.
[54:29] this is still easter season and
[54:32] jubilee season
[54:34] and i know i know brother
[54:37] i thought these two guys last weekend
[54:39] preached the best that they'd have ever
[54:41] preached
[54:42] they preached great before but i thought
[54:43] they just did awesome
[54:46] and
[54:49] and so i just have some things on my
[54:51] heart last night i thought andrew was
[54:53] going to preach my sermon so
[54:56] and i was just going i was just going to
[54:57] get up and go ditto and everybody say
[55:00] amen and we dismiss
[55:04] amen john chapter 20
[55:07] and verse 11.
[55:13] but mary stood without the sepulcher
[55:15] weeping
[55:18] and as she wept
[55:20] she stooped
[55:22] and looked into the sepulchre
[55:25] and seeth two angels in white sitting
[55:28] the one at the head and the other at the
[55:31] feet
[55:32] where the body of jesus
[55:34] had lain
[55:37] and they said unto her
[55:39] woman
[55:40] why weepest thou
[55:43] she saith unto them
[55:45] because they have taken away my lord
[55:49] and i know
[55:51] not where they have laid him
[55:54] and when she had said thus said thus
[55:57] said
[55:58] she turned herself back and saw jesus
[56:01] standing
[56:03] and knew not that it was jesus
[56:08] and jesus saith unto her
[56:10] woman
[56:12] why weepest thou
[56:14] whom seeketh thou
[56:17] and she's supposing him to be the
[56:19] gardener
[56:21] saith unto him sir
[56:24] if thou hath borne him hence
[56:27] tell me where thou has laid him
[56:30] and i will take him away
[56:33] and jesus said unto her
[56:35] mary
[56:37] she turned herself and said
[56:40] and saith unto him
[56:41] ramona
[56:45] because nobody could call her name
[56:48] like he could call her name
[56:52] and jesus saith unto her
[56:54] touch me not
[56:57] for i am not yet ascended to my father
[57:01] but go to my brethren
[57:03] and say unto them
[57:07] i ascend unto my father and your father
[57:11] and to my god
[57:13] and your god
[57:15] and mary magdalene
[57:17] came and told the disciples
[57:20] that she had seen the lord
[57:24] that he had spoken
[57:26] these things
[57:28] unto her
[57:29] you may be seated
[57:37] i want you to just notice the greatest
[57:39] event that had ever happened in history
[57:47] it was this type of a woman that jesus
[57:50] wanted at the tomb
[57:54] if you remember he assigns her and makes
[57:57] sure
[57:58] that she comes to the tomb
[58:01] she's washed his feet maybe
[58:04] she's
[58:06] been with him and no doubt they wanted
[58:08] to stone her
[58:10] but but let me just let me just say this
[58:12] to you
[58:14] he tells her that
[58:16] that she's going to anoint his body
[58:21] and so she is there on a commission
[58:24] to anoint with spices the body of jesus
[58:29] christ
[58:30] because
[58:31] he needs a witness
[58:34] that's what he's done today
[58:36] he's chose you to be a witness in this
[58:39] day
[58:40] in this laodicean darkness
[58:43] when the world is in total chaos
[58:47] when the son of man has been delivered
[58:49] into our hands and we have ate the book
[58:52] and we're the people we're literally
[58:54] more than a book we're more than tapes
[58:57] we're more than pictures but we're word
[59:00] and flesh living
[59:03] and he's chosen us as witnesses of his
[59:06] word
[59:08] jesus is standing there and
[59:12] and he's and he's beginning to speak to
[59:15] her
[59:17] now
[59:18] no doubt
[59:20] a lot of things have happened in
[59:21] dimensions
[59:23] because jesus has been a dimension
[59:25] traveler
[59:28] now remember he's been descending
[59:31] through the old testament
[59:33] and we can see him in creation
[59:35] we can see him in the garden of eden
[59:38] we can see him fellowshipping with
[59:40] abraham as a as a fire
[59:43] as a voice
[59:44] we can see him descending as he becomes
[59:47] the authentic body and he becomes
[59:50] melchizedek and he makes a promise to
[59:52] abraham
[59:54] that he's going to be the father of
[59:56] nations and a man that is 100 years old
[59:59] now has tribes to come out of him
[1:00:04] and now and now we watch him as a will
[1:00:07] within the middle of the will
[1:00:09] we see him as moses
[1:00:11] moses saw him at a burning bush that was
[1:00:14] him
[1:00:17] that was him
[1:00:19] that was god
[1:00:20] that said let there be
[1:00:23] that was more than a manifestation of
[1:00:25] god that was god in a burning bush
[1:00:30] that was him
[1:00:32] that was god sitting with abraham the
[1:00:34] one that said let there be
[1:00:37] and the sun rolled into existence and
[1:00:40] the stars came into existence and and he
[1:00:43] created a garden of eden
[1:00:46] that was him in a burning bush
[1:00:49] that was a him as a wheel within the
[1:00:51] middle of the wheel
[1:00:53] that was him as a rock in a sling that
[1:00:56] would kill goliath
[1:00:59] that was him that was a fire between
[1:01:02] daniel and a group of lions
[1:01:05] [Music]
[1:01:07] that was him that met shadrach meshach
[1:01:10] and abednego
[1:01:12] in the fire
[1:01:13] that was him
[1:01:21] that was him
[1:01:26] no doubt the devil
[1:01:29] being the anti-type of god
[1:01:32] let me just say complete different
[1:01:33] polarity
[1:01:35] god created his own enemy
[1:01:38] and so
[1:01:40] he creates light
[1:01:41] and he creates darkness
[1:01:44] he creates love
[1:01:47] and satan develops and perverts it love
[1:01:50] and becomes hate
[1:01:54] there's a thousand more adjectives that
[1:01:56] i can use right here
[1:01:59] god creates peace and satan creates war
[1:02:06] do that in your life if you're not
[1:02:07] careful
[1:02:09] and god
[1:02:10] not only has god condescended and
[1:02:13] descended himself in
[1:02:14] making his way towards the body of jesus
[1:02:18] christ
[1:02:20] he's been doing that for thousands of
[1:02:22] years making his way into the body of
[1:02:26] jesus christ
[1:02:28] god wanting to become man
[1:02:31] because as god he can't he can't forgive
[1:02:36] sins in that form
[1:02:40] but he has to become man
[1:02:43] to where that he can send that body to
[1:02:47] hell
[1:02:49] that sacrifice
[1:02:51] had to be accepted
[1:02:54] it had to be a bleeding bloody lamb
[1:02:58] a perfect lamb
[1:03:01] a perfect life
[1:03:05] god had to come to earth in a body
[1:03:10] as he had descended notice now let me
[1:03:13] just say this to you it's very difficult
[1:03:15] for humanity
[1:03:17] to see god
[1:03:19] in the now form
[1:03:22] real heart they missed moses they missed
[1:03:25] elijah they missed they missed the
[1:03:27] prophets
[1:03:29] they missed elijah they missed the
[1:03:31] prophet in this day and they missed
[1:03:34] jesus christ
[1:03:35] he was standing in their synagogues he
[1:03:38] was standing healing their people he was
[1:03:41] he was multiplying and taking the power
[1:03:44] of creativity
[1:03:48] and their eyes were blinded by
[1:03:51] denominational filters
[1:03:54] [Music]
[1:03:58] amen
[1:04:02] notice the first written encounter
[1:04:05] that we have between
[1:04:07] jesus and satan
[1:04:11] now jesus has been watching that light
[1:04:13] come all the way down
[1:04:15] even his birth
[1:04:18] then at 12 years old
[1:04:21] he explains things about the word that
[1:04:24] no prophets ever explained
[1:04:32] and
[1:04:32] and satan had to be gone
[1:04:35] that's got to be him
[1:04:41] that's got to be him
[1:04:44] and if that's him
[1:04:46] i got to stop him
[1:04:53] if that's him
[1:04:55] i got to stop him
[1:04:58] i got to stop him i saw what he did in
[1:05:00] the garden of eden
[1:05:03] and it was a blood sacrifice and if
[1:05:05] that's him
[1:05:07] he's moving from the blood of bulls and
[1:05:09] goats and sacrifices if that's him that
[1:05:12] all of these prophets have been talking
[1:05:14] about
[1:05:15] if that's him
[1:05:19] i gotta stop him
[1:05:23] so every religious spirit every
[1:05:25] perverted spirit
[1:05:27] now is at war
[1:05:31] with this one man
[1:05:34] one man on the earth
[1:05:36] walking
[1:05:39] healing sick
[1:05:41] healing the blind
[1:05:45] forgiving a man
[1:05:48] no man has ever forgiven another
[1:05:50] and been able to forgive sins
[1:05:54] walking to the pool
[1:05:58] none of their churches have produced any
[1:06:00] of this
[1:06:04] every name that they could name against
[1:06:06] him
[1:06:07] didn't stop him
[1:06:10] every question as they would question
[1:06:12] him as he preached
[1:06:14] didn't stop him
[1:06:25] we've come to the garden of the garden
[1:06:27] of gethsemane
[1:06:28] and he says father
[1:06:30] if it be thy will
[1:06:32] let this cup pass from me
[1:06:36] he was sent there
[1:06:38] to crush the head
[1:06:41] of satan's kingdom
[1:06:48] he was sent there to do what moses
[1:06:50] couldn't do
[1:06:51] what david couldn't do
[1:06:53] elijah couldn't do
[1:06:56] john the baptist couldn't do
[1:06:59] william branham couldn't do
[1:07:02] jesus christ was sent to this earth to
[1:07:05] crash and destroy
[1:07:09] to crash and destroy
[1:07:12] satan's kingdom
[1:07:23] when he's standing before pilate
[1:07:25] pilate calls him a king
[1:07:31] and he asked him about his kingdom and
[1:07:33] he said if my kingdom was of this world
[1:07:36] my substance would come and fight
[1:07:40] he was standing with a much
[1:07:42] bigger picture
[1:07:46] than jerusalem
[1:07:49] he's standing with a much bigger picture
[1:07:51] than america today
[1:07:55] he's standing with a much bigger picture
[1:07:57] than this church and this assembly
[1:08:01] he's got a plan
[1:08:03] [Applause]
[1:08:13] a lot of things happen
[1:08:15] that are unseen
[1:08:22] the disciples no doubt became confused
[1:08:27] what a confusion it would do
[1:08:33] god just allows things to happen to
[1:08:35] confuse a lot of people
[1:08:39] the man said he'd actually say things
[1:08:41] that would confuse people
[1:08:43] you know to shake off the unbeliever
[1:08:47] he said jesus did that he said
[1:08:49] unless you eat my flesh and drink my
[1:08:51] blood you have no part and people walked
[1:08:54] away
[1:08:56] the carnal believer just walked away
[1:08:58] we're not having none of that
[1:09:03] brother man preaches serpent see
[1:09:05] tens of thousands of these people walked
[1:09:07] away but that's been preached all
[1:09:09] through the bible
[1:09:12] it's not a new doctrine it's been
[1:09:13] preached all through the bible it's not
[1:09:15] brother branham's revelation it's been
[1:09:17] all the way since cain and abel
[1:09:21] just shook the unbeliever off
[1:09:27] tells them who they are
[1:09:29] jesus would say
[1:09:32] to the pharisee and those those
[1:09:35] ecumenical men of that day
[1:09:39] you're your father the devil
[1:09:42] that's much plainer language than you
[1:09:44] heard last night
[1:09:47] you have your father the devil
[1:09:51] they said a lot of words trying to get
[1:09:52] him to step into
[1:09:55] a broken humanity
[1:09:58] trying to get him to think evil thoughts
[1:10:03] trying to make every kind of rumor that
[1:10:05] you can make about him
[1:10:09] trying to break him down
[1:10:11] even standing here
[1:10:14] and he's standing with pilate
[1:10:17] to the sin was i born
[1:10:21] they're spitting on him they're mocking
[1:10:25] vinegar is given to him
[1:10:31] a black man is asked to carry his cross
[1:10:36] to calvary's heel
[1:10:39] god predestinated all of that to happen
[1:10:42] that weak beaten body
[1:10:45] and every stripe that satan tried to
[1:10:48] stop him with
[1:10:50] he did not realize that the stripes that
[1:10:53] i'm giving jesus is going to heal ron
[1:10:56] spencer
[1:11:03] is going to heal my people
[1:11:14] and satan was taking all of his cruelty
[1:11:17] out
[1:11:18] on that piece of sacrifice
[1:11:20] to fulfill isaiah 53.
[1:11:24] he was doing everything to beat him and
[1:11:27] modeling frustrating
[1:11:30] trying to become
[1:11:33] so human and show his weaknesses
[1:11:36] until he would call an angel
[1:11:40] because he knew he had power
[1:11:42] because he'd ask him on a mountain
[1:11:45] if thou be the son of god
[1:11:49] satan
[1:11:50] from the beginning had a good idea that
[1:11:53] this might be him
[1:11:55] and if it is him i got to get him
[1:11:57] stopped
[1:11:59] and he's trying to get him to use his
[1:12:02] god-likeness
[1:12:04] [Applause]
[1:12:06] to call thousands of angels because if
[1:12:09] he can get calvary stopped
[1:12:12] if he can get calvary stopped he still
[1:12:15] has a lien against you
[1:12:18] but the moment that he quits breathing
[1:12:21] and he says it is finished
[1:12:29] the moment
[1:12:31] the second
[1:12:34] the one millionth of a second
[1:12:39] that he quits breathing
[1:12:47] we're free
[1:12:48] [Applause]
[1:13:12] he walks in hell
[1:13:15] and i don't have time
[1:13:17] but he walks through hell
[1:13:20] the deepest darkest regions of hell
[1:13:23] and takes the keys of satan
[1:13:28] he defeats satan
[1:13:30] once
[1:13:31] and for all
[1:13:34] and he does every bit of it
[1:13:36] because god's not going to accept lambs
[1:13:39] and turtle doves and goats anymore he
[1:13:42] has prepared a blood himself not part
[1:13:46] mary not part joseph all god
[1:13:50] a virgin-born son of god
[1:13:54] all god
[1:13:55] gave himself for you
[1:13:57] the king of kings the lord of lords
[1:14:01] become your kinsman redeemer
[1:14:16] yes
[1:14:34] he showed him on a hillside
[1:14:37] where those
[1:14:38] pieces represented
[1:14:40] and any bible scholar here knows that
[1:14:43] each one of those pieces was a clean
[1:14:45] animal
[1:14:47] represented the sacrifice of jesus
[1:14:49] christ
[1:14:50] he was the ram
[1:14:53] he was the heifer
[1:14:55] was made the waters of separation
[1:14:58] that had you separated through
[1:15:01] now we have
[1:15:02] the washing of the water
[1:15:04] by the blood
[1:15:06] of separation from sin
[1:15:09] and through the word through the through
[1:15:11] believing
[1:15:13] and the pigeon and the turtle love was
[1:15:14] divine healing and all was in christ
[1:15:17] and their god showed abram what he was
[1:15:19] doing and through the seed of abraham
[1:15:22] he would bring forth his only begotten
[1:15:25] son christ and was slain yonder between
[1:15:28] heavens and earth and the sun went down
[1:15:30] in the blackness over the earth and
[1:15:33] there he tore him apart
[1:15:35] god pulled his soul out of him
[1:15:42] and he wrote a covenant
[1:15:45] with the families of the earth
[1:15:48] remember program said god swore by
[1:15:51] himself
[1:15:52] when he could swear by no greater
[1:15:56] glory
[1:16:04] he said my god my god why hast thou
[1:16:07] forsaken me
[1:16:08] his face full of mockery and spit a
[1:16:10] crown of
[1:16:12] mockery pulled down over his brow
[1:16:14] nails drove those roman spikes his back
[1:16:18] ribbon
[1:16:18] his rib showed through swinging on a
[1:16:21] cross screaming dying
[1:16:23] dying a sinner's death
[1:16:25] the sin of the world
[1:16:28] was upon
[1:16:32] him you never take that for granted
[1:16:37] the only man-made things in heaven
[1:16:40] will be the scars in his hands
[1:16:43] as an eternal reminder
[1:16:49] there god riveted his sides
[1:16:52] tore his soul out of him
[1:16:55] when he said into thy hands i commend my
[1:16:58] spirit he dropped his head and the earth
[1:17:01] shook
[1:17:03] and bounced out its rock
[1:17:05] there he is
[1:17:07] god's covenant
[1:17:10] there's the fulfilling of it
[1:17:21] what a powerful quote
[1:17:36] what a powerful blood
[1:17:44] here i want to i want to spend a few
[1:17:46] moments
[1:17:47] what a powerful blood
[1:17:50] that i want a woman
[1:17:53] to be the first witness
[1:17:58] i want you to think on this i wanna i'm
[1:18:00] gonna take it slow here just for a
[1:18:02] second
[1:18:03] we can shout in a few minutes
[1:18:08] but i want one of the filthiest women
[1:18:14] that i have forgiven
[1:18:19] i want one of the filthiest women
[1:18:22] that i have forgiven
[1:18:24] to be the witness
[1:18:28] of my resurrection
[1:18:35] she should be put to death they screamed
[1:18:38] the law said she should be put to death
[1:18:42] she should be put to death the law says
[1:18:44] it
[1:18:45] and it was true
[1:18:48] the sin that she was committing
[1:18:51] and jesus stoops
[1:19:04] he begins to write in the sand
[1:19:09] he that is without sin
[1:19:17] cast the
[1:19:18] first stone
[1:19:33] because they knew he
[1:19:34] knew in that atmosphere they knew he
[1:19:37] knew
[1:19:39] and they knew if he knew
[1:19:41] he could tell it
[1:19:43] and if he told come on
[1:19:47] and if he told it they was going to lose
[1:19:49] their job
[1:19:53] if he told it their their position in
[1:19:56] the community was going to be over
[1:19:58] so we'll let this harlot just stand here
[1:20:03] and the first time that jesus looks into
[1:20:05] her eyes he asked her said woman
[1:20:09] where is don accuser and she said i have
[1:20:12] none
[1:20:16] hallelujah
[1:20:18] i have none
[1:20:23] i want to ask you woman
[1:20:25] where is thine accuser
[1:20:28] because of the blood of jesus christ
[1:20:31] i have none
[1:20:33] [Applause]
[1:20:59] this is the first time he looks into her
[1:21:00] eyes
[1:21:02] but he's not done with her
[1:21:15] rachel
[1:21:19] some of you sisters
[1:21:21] kind of know what we're talking about
[1:21:22] here
[1:21:25] so stained
[1:21:28] and she spends the rest of her
[1:21:31] days with him and his flesh
[1:21:34] as a representation
[1:21:36] of what this blood can do
[1:21:40] i forgive you
[1:21:46] now
[1:21:48] now she's standing
[1:22:00] and it's her name
[1:22:06] it's her name
[1:22:08] it's the first name that he calls
[1:22:12] in that risen savior form
[1:22:21] [Applause]
[1:22:34] wow
[1:22:50] touch me not
[1:22:57] i can't let cursed earth
[1:23:01] touch me at this point
[1:23:06] you're forgiven
[1:23:08] but your humanity
[1:23:14] i can't let you touch me just now
[1:23:17] imagine how she wanted to kiss his feet
[1:23:19] again
[1:23:23] can you imagine the millions of emotions
[1:23:26] that's going through her mind she
[1:23:28] watched them put a spear in him
[1:23:30] she watched the thorns she watched him
[1:23:33] beat him
[1:23:34] she watched him breathe his last breath
[1:23:46] she spent three days of horror
[1:23:50] and now
[1:23:52] she's looking at him
[1:24:12] and he now tells her
[1:24:14] go tell my disciples
[1:24:18] i'm rising
[1:24:22] i told you a few days in the meeting
[1:24:25] that i was going to raise
[1:24:28] and if you were paying attention
[1:24:31] i have power to lay my life down
[1:24:34] and i have power to take it up again
[1:24:40] i am my father of one
[1:24:42] and he expresses his deity but he's got
[1:24:44] to die as a man
[1:24:50] i want you to just think just for a
[1:24:52] moment
[1:24:56] we're in a moment
[1:25:00] of a resurrection
[1:25:02] where satan couldn't touch him
[1:25:06] i want you to think about it
[1:25:08] he could never kill him again
[1:25:16] he can never torture him again
[1:25:19] he can never say bad things to that
[1:25:22] piece of flesh again
[1:25:26] will never suffer with a headache again
[1:25:29] he will never be hungry again
[1:25:33] he will never be in meetings to where
[1:25:35] that he will have to tussle in that
[1:25:37] humanity
[1:25:41] so satan knows
[1:25:45] i can't touch this jesus
[1:25:50] [Music]
[1:25:53] calvary paid it all
[1:26:16] he had come out of an earth
[1:26:19] he'd came out of the earth
[1:26:21] and was walking among man
[1:26:24] but
[1:26:25] he had not yet ascended
[1:26:28] and he told mary
[1:26:32] don't touch me
[1:26:34] and she said rapona
[1:26:37] and he said touch
[1:26:39] don't touch me
[1:26:41] for i've not yet ascended
[1:26:43] to my father
[1:26:46] but i ascend to my god
[1:26:49] and to your god
[1:26:51] to my father and your father
[1:26:55] what's this next statement
[1:26:58] and then that night
[1:27:00] after he had done went up before god
[1:27:04] and rose up from the dead
[1:27:07] and went up before god
[1:27:09] coming back
[1:27:12] he invited thomas
[1:27:16] to come touch his side
[1:27:20] he had ascended before god
[1:27:25] now watch this
[1:27:27] brother brown has a very important way
[1:27:28] to say some things
[1:27:32] he said you know einstein proved
[1:27:35] this is a prophet taking the greatest
[1:27:37] scientists that ever lived who many term
[1:27:39] einstein lived before his time
[1:27:44] you know einstein proved that if
[1:27:46] two forces are coming together
[1:27:50] fast enough
[1:27:51] they could pass through each other
[1:27:55] never never bother each other
[1:27:58] if two cars are coming down the road and
[1:28:01] they were going a terrific speed
[1:28:05] faster than sound
[1:28:07] just billions of miles per second they'd
[1:28:10] probably pass right through each other
[1:28:12] without hurting one another
[1:28:17] he proved that
[1:28:19] einstein proved that
[1:28:23] by forces striking together well you see
[1:28:27] we are such an earthbound people
[1:28:31] you're going to like this
[1:28:33] until about all we think about is can
[1:28:36] you think about it as time
[1:28:39] and space
[1:28:41] but when we leave this world
[1:28:45] we're going where there is no time
[1:28:50] and we can think of 50 miles an hour 100
[1:28:53] miles an hour
[1:28:54] 2 000 miles an hour
[1:28:56] 10 000
[1:28:59] miles an hour
[1:29:01] that don't even start when you think of
[1:29:04] eternity
[1:29:06] notice these next words how fast jesus
[1:29:10] after he had been glorified received his
[1:29:13] glorified body raised up from the dead
[1:29:16] had ascended on high to the father and
[1:29:19] come back in a few seconds
[1:29:24] and with such a terrific speed until he
[1:29:27] come right back in before his disciples
[1:29:31] through a wall and never even moved the
[1:29:34] wall
[1:29:39] and yet with the body that could stand
[1:29:42] there
[1:29:43] and eat fish
[1:29:49] and bread
[1:29:53] that speed coming through
[1:29:58] notice these words
[1:30:00] and he can come all the way
[1:30:02] from glory to your hearts
[1:30:06] as quick as you can think about him
[1:30:09] as quick as you can confess your wrongs
[1:30:12] he can run the devil out and bring
[1:30:15] himself in and just as fast as you can
[1:30:18] have enough faith to believe it
[1:30:25] hallelujah
[1:30:34] hallelujah
[1:30:36] that's how fast
[1:30:39] it's not on man it's not an ability of
[1:30:42] human being
[1:30:43] god can change your life just like that
[1:30:47] one service one minute
[1:30:49] one situation
[1:30:55] and it don't matter what anybody else
[1:30:56] says
[1:30:58] you just know
[1:31:01] [Music]
[1:31:08] there's a time you couldn't touch him
[1:31:13] there's a time you couldn't get to him
[1:31:16] but that middle wall has been turned
[1:31:18] tore down
[1:31:21] it's been tore down now it's death not
[1:31:24] to come into him
[1:31:26] and you can have as much of god as you
[1:31:29] one of him
[1:31:30] i got news for you i want enough i can
[1:31:33] shake the kingdom of hell with
[1:32:02] forgive me for having to take a little
[1:32:03] time
[1:32:09] do you remember when brother branham
[1:32:11] explains
[1:32:13] going beyond the curtain of time
[1:32:24] what a terrific story that is
[1:32:27] i just felt checked let me just hold
[1:32:29] that just for a moment
[1:32:39] brother brahm explains dimensions
[1:32:42] we never had a preacher
[1:32:44] i i do a bit of
[1:32:46] we never have a preacher
[1:32:49] ever touch dimension
[1:32:50] speaking
[1:32:52] like this prophet did amen
[1:32:56] it's because you're going to be touched
[1:32:57] by two different dimensions
[1:33:00] there's two different forces trying to
[1:33:02] get into your life
[1:33:03] one's god and one's a devil
[1:33:06] and the devil's going to work on you and
[1:33:08] work on you and work on you and i'm
[1:33:10] going somewhere with this this morning
[1:33:12] he's going to condemn you he's going to
[1:33:14] talk about you he's going to do all
[1:33:16] different kinds of things
[1:33:18] he's going to shake you he's going to
[1:33:19] try to
[1:33:21] destroy you because you're carrying a
[1:33:23] light
[1:33:29] billions of people even trillions of
[1:33:31] people in the earth why you
[1:33:34] other people have trouble
[1:33:37] sure they have trouble
[1:33:40] but why is the enemy in your ear so much
[1:33:44] he recognizes the atmosphere
[1:33:48] so he'll make you offers he'll make
[1:33:51] these offers for jobs he'll make you
[1:33:52] offers for relationships he'll make you
[1:33:56] offers for money he'll make you every
[1:33:58] kind of an offer that there is just to
[1:34:01] distract you
[1:34:12] jesus when he was here on earth because
[1:34:14] he was going to conquer hell
[1:34:18] speaks a lot about hell
[1:34:26] it speaks more about hell then actually
[1:34:28] he speaks about heaven
[1:34:30] your bible readers
[1:34:33] some of you are now by now gray-headed
[1:34:35] and got almost bible scholars
[1:34:37] so you realize that he talks about hell
[1:34:40] so it's a real place
[1:34:46] brother branham said i think that the
[1:34:47] fifth dimension is where the sinner dies
[1:34:53] now i think that when the sinner dies he
[1:34:56] he goes into this fourth dimension
[1:34:59] now let me let me just let me just say
[1:35:01] this to you
[1:35:02] when a sinner dies
[1:35:06] because it's an unconverted soul
[1:35:11] it's it's no more than the death i i
[1:35:14] don't mean to be belligerent but this is
[1:35:15] just how it is
[1:35:16] it's no more than the death of a dog
[1:35:19] or a dog of an animal
[1:35:22] because if you don't have the holy ghost
[1:35:23] you have an animalistic
[1:35:26] nature
[1:35:27] on you
[1:35:33] i didn't write the book i just died
[1:35:38] now notice
[1:35:40] he says now notice
[1:35:42] that the first thing this is sinner
[1:35:45] the first thing he cannot go into the
[1:35:47] presence of god because he is a sinner
[1:35:52] and his time is up on earth let me
[1:35:54] remember brother tim saying to us that
[1:35:57] there comes a time in your life to where
[1:36:00] your body
[1:36:01] can't sustain life
[1:36:05] it just can't sustain life
[1:36:08] i was standing i was sitting with my
[1:36:10] doctor the other day and she said
[1:36:12] you have any questions and i said i want
[1:36:14] to know where we're at
[1:36:16] she said you're a miracle
[1:36:18] she just point blank said you're a
[1:36:20] miracle
[1:36:21] she said every day that you live is a
[1:36:23] miracle in that right sister calling she
[1:36:25] said you're a miracle we've had a lot of
[1:36:27] patients through that have what you have
[1:36:29] they're gone they're gone even since
[1:36:31] you've been here
[1:36:32] you're you're you're one of a kind
[1:36:35] every day is a miracle she said do i
[1:36:38] need to get a psychologist to you to
[1:36:40] tell you that you
[1:36:41] i don't know i don't need that
[1:36:47] she said now it's kind of like a man
[1:36:49] with a heart condition he said she said
[1:36:51] he could die at any moment
[1:36:53] he said because he's got a heart
[1:36:54] condition he may he may live several
[1:36:56] years and he said he's got a heart
[1:36:58] condition said
[1:37:00] and he and he struggles with that heart
[1:37:02] condition she said the disease that you
[1:37:04] have is not heart condition it's cancer
[1:37:08] and you've got fourth stage cancer you
[1:37:10] have just as much cancer as you had when
[1:37:13] you came in here and you started
[1:37:16] she said but the chemo has
[1:37:19] has controlled it
[1:37:22] it's still there but it's controlled
[1:37:25] and then she smiled
[1:37:29] and your god
[1:37:33] [Applause]
[1:37:50] we get sermons in a lot of strange
[1:37:51] places
[1:37:54] and i was laying on the table under a
[1:37:56] blanket
[1:38:00] and god spoke to me this sermon
[1:38:04] laying there while they were looking for
[1:38:06] the cancer
[1:38:12] and it was all right there
[1:38:15] and i begin to think
[1:38:17] such a katie you was listening to i was
[1:38:19] going to share this with you on the road
[1:38:21] yesterday but you were going 90 mile an
[1:38:23] hour and i was going
[1:38:28] 30. i said i just got to share this with
[1:38:31] somebody
[1:38:32] and so katie was she'd walked to the
[1:38:34] barn and she was walking up and down the
[1:38:36] road because that's her treadmill and i
[1:38:38] just walked out i had my straw hat on i
[1:38:40] thought i'll share this with katie
[1:38:54] but can you just think of this
[1:38:57] here they are they're taking the
[1:38:58] greatest equipment that there is
[1:39:01] you're going to like this you're going
[1:39:02] to like this they're taking the greatest
[1:39:04] equipment that there is and looking for
[1:39:07] the killer cells in this body
[1:39:13] and god speaks into my ears
[1:39:16] this sermon
[1:39:31] they're looking for death and god's
[1:39:34] given me life
[1:39:39] hallelujah
[1:39:40] [Applause]
[1:40:06] let me just help you with your vision
[1:40:08] just a bit
[1:40:10] you might be focused on a few dead cells
[1:40:16] that was in the woman
[1:40:18] that was standing there
[1:40:21] but god was focused on a bigger picture
[1:40:25] she's gonna sit at my table
[1:40:27] [Applause]
[1:40:43] i want to share a couple more quotes
[1:40:44] just before we close
[1:40:47] is that all right
[1:40:53] he's talking about hell
[1:40:56] and he said if i would type it for you
[1:41:00] it's like going to sleep
[1:41:06] and you're in a nightmare
[1:41:11] you see curious things
[1:41:14] you're
[1:41:16] screaming that's the state of the wicked
[1:41:20] dead
[1:41:26] this is what he was saving us from
[1:41:32] he cannot go into the presence of god
[1:41:35] because he's a sinner
[1:41:38] how many times now i'm off the quote how
[1:41:41] many times did he turn god down
[1:41:44] how many times did she turn god down
[1:41:53] what you accepted they turned down
[1:42:02] he cannot return back to the earth
[1:42:04] because his time is up
[1:42:07] you can't get a redo
[1:42:09] if i'm speaking to somebody on the
[1:42:11] internet there's no redos here
[1:42:15] there's no redos
[1:42:17] oh when i get there i'm going to plead
[1:42:18] all different kind of there's no redos
[1:42:20] here
[1:42:22] why don't you get it fixed
[1:42:24] lay aside your pride lay aside every
[1:42:27] weight in the sin will still so easily
[1:42:29] beset you
[1:42:36] how long does it take
[1:42:40] snap your finger
[1:42:44] that's how quick
[1:42:49] i was going to have brain surgery
[1:42:51] and in a moment
[1:42:53] it was
[1:42:54] different and in a moment you were
[1:42:57] different
[1:42:58] and in a moment you were different i saw
[1:43:01] the night that it was different for you
[1:43:05] i saw it i saw it when you came to you
[1:43:08] you'd been resistant you had fought it
[1:43:10] you thought i could get to it i'm gonna
[1:43:12] sit through it and all of a sudden it's
[1:43:13] him
[1:43:23] he cannot return back to earth because
[1:43:25] his time is up
[1:43:27] and he's caught between two things
[1:43:30] in the fifth dimension
[1:43:32] he's got a soul and he cannot go into
[1:43:34] the presence of god because it's not
[1:43:36] covered by the blood
[1:43:40] he's a sinner
[1:43:44] he cannot wake himself up
[1:43:48] because his time is up on earth
[1:43:51] and there he is in a tormented nightmare
[1:43:55] think of now before you enter into a
[1:43:58] nightmare screaming
[1:44:00] many of us have had nightmares it's just
[1:44:02] because we're we're told because the two
[1:44:05] consciences are passing sub and first
[1:44:07] conscience and it catches between and
[1:44:09] that's a nightmare and when a sinner
[1:44:11] dies he's caught with his soul between
[1:44:15] the earth
[1:44:16] and hell
[1:44:18] because remember he's got to be judged
[1:44:21] and he's in a nightmare
[1:44:24] and there he stands
[1:44:31] how he's ever had a nightmare
[1:44:38] i'm on a i'm on a drug
[1:44:42] that that i take morning and night and i
[1:44:45] take it right before i go to bed
[1:44:48] and and the side effect is nightmares
[1:44:52] and i pray that god bridles the
[1:44:54] nightmare
[1:44:56] that's what i do
[1:44:58] but there's your body's made up of a
[1:45:00] chemical body so it's it's got its
[1:45:02] satan uses what he can to get into that
[1:45:05] so i'm in a relaxed state
[1:45:08] and so in that state
[1:45:10] he attacks through that dimension this
[1:45:13] very morning
[1:45:14] knowing this is a sermon that i'm
[1:45:16] preaching this very moment
[1:45:18] this morning
[1:45:21] i'm working as a preacher
[1:45:25] with some very precious friends as a
[1:45:27] preacher and these demons are screaming
[1:45:30] to me
[1:45:31] you're not good enough
[1:45:34] you're not good enough
[1:45:36] you'll never be good enough
[1:45:38] and they're screaming
[1:45:40] you're just a horrible wretch for a
[1:45:42] preacher and they're just screaming in
[1:45:44] that
[1:45:46] and i wake up sister connie's already
[1:45:48] slept on the bed and i'm waking up
[1:45:50] somewhere out right near six o'clock
[1:45:53] and i'm just bawling
[1:45:55] because it has an emotional effect and i
[1:45:58] wake up and i i sense what's going on
[1:46:03] now's the only time he can get to me
[1:46:17] now i'm going to preach to you

[1:47:56] and his body was still laying there and
[1:47:58] here he was
[1:48:02] and brother branham just in that moment

[1:48:35] that the sex cells
[1:48:37] in the body
[1:48:40] was gone
[1:48:42] oh what a place
[1:48:46] they're gone
[1:48:48] and they're hugging
[1:48:50] and he's not feeling that

[1:49:42] i don't know if you notice this or not
[1:49:44] but
[1:49:45] if that seed that is in you
[1:49:48] is the seed of god
[1:49:51] can i can i go just a couple more
[1:49:53] moments
[1:49:55] i want to speak to the adult class in
[1:49:57] the room
[1:49:58] if that seed
[1:50:01] that is planted
[1:50:03] goes into that womb
[1:50:05] and that womb closes
[1:50:09] it seals itself off
[1:50:13] to where no contaminant
[1:50:15] i'm trying my best not to shout right
[1:50:17] now
[1:50:19] i'm doing my utter best to behave
[1:50:23] if that seed of a life
[1:50:26] happy birthday
[1:50:29] happy anniversary
[1:50:30] and that seed of life
[1:50:33] goes in there
[1:50:41] i mean

[1:50:45] and you're gonna pick his name out
[1:50:48] then you're gonna live life for nine
[1:50:50] months
[1:50:52] carrying and feeding
[1:50:57] and there's a lot of contamination in
[1:50:59] the world
[1:51:01] but god seals even the natural body
[1:51:05] to where that no contamination can go
[1:51:08] inside of that and get ahold of that
[1:51:11] seed
[1:51:15] what about your spirituals being
[1:51:19] when god gives you the holy ghost
[1:51:24] more than an emotion
[1:51:25] more than a touch
[1:51:27] when god gives you the holy ghost and it
[1:51:30] becomes the seed of life
[1:51:33] christ in you
[1:51:35] he seals the womb off
[1:51:41] he seals it off
[1:51:44] and satan can't touch you
