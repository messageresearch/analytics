chapter if there be therefore any consolation in christ if any comfort of love if any fellowship of the spirit if any bowels of mercy fulfill ye my joy that ye be like-minded having the same love and being of one accord of one mind let nothing be done through strife or vain glory but in loneliness of mine and let each esteem others better than themselves look not every man on his own things but every man also the one things of others let this mind be in you which is also in christ jesus who being in the form of god thought and not robbie to be equal with god but made of himself no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even to death of the cross forth god hath highly exalted him and given him a name above every name that at the name of jesus every knee should bow and every tongue should confess that jesus christ is lord to the glory of god isn't he wonderful just stop to think about the name jesus the greatest name that has ever been spoken on this earth from adam all the way down amen let's pray heavenly father we're thankful you've given us this opportunity to be a brother ron in this church we love and appreciate those news people lord for many many many years thank god for each one of them may the holy spirit come and minister to the

deliver and set free and bind up the broken heart we humbly pray in the name of the lord jesus christ bless the word of god to each heart we've asked in jesus christ's name amen and amen you may be seated you know the first time that the name jesus was named on the earth is an angel of god told mary gabriel told mary thou shall call his name jesus for he shall save his people from their sins that name is above every name above every name it'll always be above every name in that name there's power and deliverance and salvation everything that you have need of i'll tell you right now it couldn't can come in the name of the lord jesus christ we can glorify god for that and i think about when we all went to school you think about the tens of hundreds of billions of names that have been named on this earth since adam yes adam write down enoch amen coming right on down on abraham isaac jacob amen moses elijah jeremiah john the baptist the name of jesus greater than all those names combined amen you know why god empowered that name he empower it's it's the sweetest there's only a name on the earth whereby there's salvation in the lord jesus christ and uh we can and that name's above every name absolutely it's worthy of all praise honor and glory and magnification we could give it can you say amen we went to school you know we were our history of as an american citizens you know what there was a washington who was our first president amen great man wasn't he that father of a nation we say but the truth about this his name wasn't as great as jesus amen abraham lincoln was a mighty man right out of kentucky but you know what folks this name is above that name there's not a great name greater absolutely we've had some great presidents men has walked on the earth but you know something their name was great in the eyes of man but you know what it was never as exalted as high as jesus christ was he was exalted so high he had to look down from heaven to see earth absolutely he's god absolutely we glorify his precious name tonight knowing that he's able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we could ask to think of him according to the power of god that works within us whereas the apostle paul said it this way i beseech you therefore brother by the mercies of god that you present your body a living sacrifice holy and acceptable which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind let this mind be in you which is also in christ jesus amen moses was a great man elijah was a great man but you know what i want to be like jesus he is our example there's not another one that we could be and exa have as an example as a prophet of god said there's been great men but in him dwelt all the fullness of the godhead body god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself he's still god able to do exceededly abundantly above all that we could ask you to think of him according to the power of god that works within us can you say praise the lord i'll tell you what he walked up on this earth yes that he's baptized of john the river of jordan winning the wilderness returned in the power of the spirit took up the scripture and read it said this day this scripture is fulfilled praise god we're still fulfilling the scripture right tonight absolutely many men come on this earth but jesus christ humbled himself became a servant the lowest if he could go absolutely for you and i to reach down and take a hulk and pick a center of our life of sin and debauchery ungodliness and evil think about that the law couldn't do that prophecy couldn't do that but i'll tell you the name of jesus can do it there's power in that name it could drive out every devil demon in power and principality drive back the enemy and give victory in our lives if you just dare to trust it believe god god will touch you deliver you set you free hallelujah make you whole by the power of god he is the mighty god he is the everlasting father he is the prince of peace he's a wonderful savior redeemer can everybody say amen let me just read about his name don't justify but

god he is the everlasting father he is the prince of peace absolutely you can look to him and god will bring you through all the trials and tribulations and distress that you'll never go through amen i'll think about the little woman that had the issue of blood and you know she spent all that she had everything she had trying to get better but she heard about jesus oh and the crowd was large maybe 20 000 people as a prophet that god said but you know what she made up in her mind her heart if i can press through the crowd just touch his garment just touch his garment i believe that i'll be healed how many people did she had to push out of her way sometimes you got to become persistent you just can't play around amen she struggled and strived finally she got to where the garment was looked and seen it and amen ratchet took a hook of his garment and instantly she was healed by the power of god you know jesus felt the strength leave his body he turned around and looked and she said who's that touch me well the disciple says all many of them are touching you look at the crowd he said but i felt strength virtue leave my body someone she probably drove back like to hide herself but she couldn't hide from jesus hallelujah little lady your faith has made you whole faith in jesus christ will move every mountain it'll move out every devil redeeming power he'll heal the sicklings the leopard razor dead bless it be the name of the lord you know many things that happen down through this bible right here god's able to do exceededly abundantly above over here in uh uh john saint john the 11th chapter we read about lazarus his two sisters jesus was very close to them but he was on a mission to preach the gospel of the kingdom of god when lazarus fell sick and died you know the old saying is jesus is four days late but he's right on time yeah i'll tell you what he'll never be late he'll be there on time so they sent for jesus to come the lazarus friend had died in fact time he

martha and mary they're they're very disturbed here they come to to jesus you know and uh uh lord if you'd have been here if you've just been here our friend lazarus would not my brother would not have died jesus said to her believe me you just believe and you'll see the glory of god you'll see the blessings of the lord absolutely you just believe god amen just stand and believe it anyhow amen coming on down near the tomb you know he met mary and talk with her you know to get her to believe believe god that day and time a grave wasn't a big old gravesite you know it was just a hole in the ground that's all it was just a hole in the ground that day of time they didn't have fancy caskets like you and i know of they just rolled him up with a rat wrap it called a uh burial cloth but i

said moses moses and he said here am i and he said draw not nigh hither put off thy shoes off of thy feet for the place where upon thou stand is the holy ground moreover he said i am the god of the father of god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob and moses hid his face from from for he was afraid to look upon god and the lord said and said i have surely seen the afflictions of my people which are in egypt and have heard their cry by re by reason and of their task masters for i know their sorrows for i am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the egyptians and to bring them out of the land unto unto a good land and to a large and unto a land flowing with milk and honey and unto the place of the canaanites and the high tides in there and the amorites and the persianites and the hivites and the jebusites now therefore behold the cry of the children of israel is coming to me and i have also seen their oppression were with the egyptians oppressed them come now therefore and i will send thee unto pharaoh that thou mayest bring forth my people of the children of israel out of egypt and moses said unto god who am i and that i should go unto the pharaoh and that i should bring forth the children of israel out of egypt and and he said certainly i will be with thee and this shall be a token with unto thee that i have sent thee were thou hast brought brought forth the people out of egypt and you shall serve god upon this mountain and moses said unto god behold when i am come unto the children of israel and have come and shall say unto them the god of your fathers hath sent me unto you and they shall say unto me what is his name what shall i say unto them and god said unto moses i am that i am and he said thus shall thou say unto the children i am has sent me unto you amen may the lord add his blessings to his word this evening amen you may be seated amen as we we get ready to go into what was going on many times in our life we find ourselves in a in a desert form we find ourselves we find ourselves because the devil wants to keep us locked into what we used to be what we what we used to be and i we you'd find it in many times we come up short because we don't lean on jesus christ amen but the i am came to moses here and he's telling him he's going who am i that i can go out there and fight this amen but look at it it was jesus christ himself god himself he came down and was talking to him lift the ear and tell him you tell him that i am with you the i am when the i am is with you he will be in you from then on amen philippians philippians says it in whom i have began a good work amen that is what he has began in you a good work is inside of you but you'll not get anywhere my i had one of my boys i hope he's watching it on the on the web but i looked at him and you know he was going how can i get a raise and how can i do better at my job and how can i do this many times it takes a personal input from you you must diligently go after seeking jesus christ amen you must look for in the bible and find yourself inside of there and i look at it and i said you know if you show up every day every service amen i looked at my people and i preached the same thing you show up you're looking for something god knows what's inside of your heart he's looking for more than just somebody to occupy you he's looking for somebody to praise god amen he's looking for his praises and man he's done everything for you why can't we praise him amen when we look at it we see all the miracles around us we see things going on the i am is with us at all times amen i looked at my brother back here he was looking for an answer but his answer laid inside of him amen it was jesus christ said you will see miracles amen go back to that and you stand up on that promise of god that if god spoke to you one time and said there's going you will see miracles you're going to see miracles you look at yourself this evening you watched a man walk through the valley of the shadow of death you watched him travel down those trails but you see the i am talked to him and told him ye shall see miracles what if you trust me amen if you trust someone you will trust them with your life you will trust them and don't ever think that you're so small that god can't see you god is so important in your life and god moves by his spirit if you come by and knocked on your door he's not going to leave you when you're when you've gone astray you just have to ask forgiveness and come back many times the devil wants to bond us up in chains in a jailhouse that always said well you remember you thought this and you remember it says in the bible that if you thought this that this one you know what's going to happen what you need to do is get out i see devil you lie to me every time you talk to a man but jesus christ when he talked to me he said i'll be with you even in you until the end of the world right now i don't think there's no end to the world yet i'm looking at the future of a new world coming but i'm looking at it he's still in me he's still in you amen he's stealing the fire fighting those battles for us why should we worry amen moses when he was walking down through there he was probably thinking all i've got's a stick my donkey my wife my kids what am i going to do aaron what do you think he's looking over here what am i going to do but god was in him and he had a purpose within him i don't care how the big the united states is i don't care how big the world the roman catholic church is my jesus is greater than anything right there and man when he wants to make you feel small and say well i look around and i see the church and it's all small and you know i go into church when i'm preaching i'm looking at this many people and i'm preaching you just as hard as i'm preaching to you all why because it said where two or three gathered in my name that he would be in the midst of us amen the i am the i am jesus christ is in the midst of his people that who believeth upon him and the amazing grace of god gives you that opportunity to let jesus christ have his way inside of your life that he can move those mountains he can touch your life i mean you're just not a nobody you are a god called predestinated by the word of god the word lives in you the letter of that word lives inside of your life and i thank god for that tonight amen i'm just not me amen it's jesus christ i'm veil and deity amen brother brandon puts it like this right here god is in man and he's identifying himself today in his church in a born-again christian god identifies himself that he remains god and the outside world only knows god as they see god in you and i and the only and that's the only way that they'll ever know god is when we are written epistles as epistles of the scripture we are read of all men and the life that we reflect is what's on the inside of us that being jesus christ amen that's all you could ask for though death may come your way i mean those sickness may come your way the light that lays inside of you is jesus christ amen the god would move down so thoroughly through you that you ain't gonna you ain't gonna worry about what the world thinks about you right now you're saying i want to know what jesus thinks about me and man i want to know what the lord is looking down and seeing me right now i want to be praising him i want to lift up his name i think about this and i was looking and anybody ever lost anything this is it my 15 minutes is over but you look at you see god moving and i try to find god in everything that i'm looking at now i tell you what i work in the machine shop i work on some very technical tools i'm stupid but they're smart tools hey man but so we look at this and we see it but i can lose i don't lose the big handles i lose that little bitty part you know them ones but terry when you look for that nail that one nail that you need it'll fit you find everything else but you can't find that one it fits right there that's the time i start cleaning up that's when i start cleaning up i start brooming out and i start sweeping real carefully because i know it's small i start looking it out and i get all that and i take my i take my whole room and i bring it back together into one big knot and i'm like lord how am i going to find it and he brought to my attention i got a big magnet and i thought about brother branham and how he talked about how he saw that magnet come out at the end of the day here it come and i said god if you answered that through him you can answer it through me and i got to thinking about what dad said right there ain't no grave gonna hold my body down and man i got to pushing that magnet across that dirt pile it may have been just some of the scummiest greasiest dirt there ever was but inside that pile there become a shaking going on there was something coming up out of the inside of that that was more than just dirt or trash it was what i was looking for now what i had done before i took and i took a substitute that was the same size the same look everything and stuck it in there and that tool wouldn't work at all and i got to thinking about a little bit deeper brother thomas i said it's going to take the original we are many member bride of jesus christ and as i'm searching through that i'm seeing that dirt and it all these little metal pieces coming up here and they hitting on that metal hitting on my magnet i flipped that thing over and i looked right in the middle and there was that little bitty piece that i needed i said glory to god my boss always tells me he said i know when things are going right because you get back there praising god amen when things start going right hey man you start praising god you know but when you stub your finger you start going praise the lord thank you lord you know ain't your true one but when something comes through on the inside that matches up glory this is what i'm looking for i'm looking for a mighty russian wind to come in and the healing and feeling could happen and here he comes in and i take that piece out and i take a piece out was incorrect it didn't fit the puzzle it didn't fit exactly but i took mine that was supposed to be there so when you think you're little and you're nothing stick yourself inside the bride of jesus christ i closed that thing up took it over there to the tort machine and that'll tell you when you get to the end it'll tell you what you've done right it'll tell you what you've done wrong and this time there wasn't nothing done wrong i passed it it worked out why because it takes all of us you may think you're small but it takes all of us amen moses may have thought he was small walking down there against that great egyptian that that ruled the world but one man and the i am stood there said let my people go he has heard our prayer tonight and i'm looking at him every time i think about ron dean and i think about brother lloyd walls and them being sick i think about all his sickness devil let my people go may he hear our prayers tonight god bless you hallelujah aren't you thankful to be serving the i am god that knows how to place every person in the position you know when they were building the the temple there was not a buzz there was not a cut that was placed in out that throughout the whole city where they were building the temple because every piece would fit so perfect in that temple and you may feel like you're small and you may feel sometimes you just feel like you pushed off to the side god has a place for you and he's been working on you for quite a long time to get you where you are but he's a good god won't you stand with us this evening let's sing that

you love the lord turn with me over into luke chapter 1 and verse 39 this evening i won't be i won't be too long but i was sitting i was sitting there and just the lord just dropped something in my heart so i'd like to speak to you just for just a very short time here on the power of your story the power of your story luke chapter 1 and verse 39. and mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste into a city of judah and entered into the house of zacharias and saluted elizabeth and it came to pass that when elizabeth heard the salutation of mary the babe leaped in her womb and elizabeth was filled with the holy ghost and she spake out with a loud voice and said blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb and whence is this to me that the mother of my lord should come to me for lo as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in my ears the babe leaped in my womb for joy and blessed is she that believed for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the lord father we come to you tonight lord this very special evening lord we have felt your spirit father we have heard how great you are we've heard about the name that is above every name we've heard that you're still in the miracle working business and when you create that miracle father you place us in our position father that we would stand there in action father i pray lord that through the chaos of life just now lord i pray that our story would ring out father throughout the ages and lord i pray that you would bless this congregation and those that are listening on the other side of the internet may be on the other side of the world but i pray father that you would bless them where they are in jesus name amen you can be seated this evening the power of your story every one of us sitting here this evening have a very powerful story every one of us have gone through life every one of us have went through different circumstances of life that has made you into the person that you are you have maybe some of you have been been tempted all by all kinds of things but i want to point out to the devil you're here there's a lot of things that you may have gone through in life but i want to point out to the devil you're here there's a lot of things that that we go through in christian in christian life we would think that sometimes that that just because we become a christian that everything works out everything works out and everything's goody to shoe for the rest of our life and it's just peachy but sometimes life gets difficult and sometimes life has a turn in it that that causes that causes you to wonder what is god doing in my life and you think about why in the world why would i go through this and why would i go through that but and it looks like that that sometimes you're more you're more down than you are up and it looks like you're more out than you are in but i want you to know that as long as jesus is with you throughout your story if it don't matter how long you've been down he can bring you up it don't matter how long you've been out he can bring you in and every person sitting here i'd say that if we would ask the question or if we would be honest here i'd say that every person here would say that they enjoy life that there's a certain part of life that you enjoy now now maybe you don't necessarily enjoy working or working with a certain person but i'd say that 90 of us would say that we enjoy working we enjoy our family we enjoy our we enjoy coming to church we enjoy god we enjoy our salvation we enjoy living for god we enjoy life but as long as jesus is there throughout the throughout the span of your life now we've told this story many times at funerals but as as as we would we would go and we would bury a person then we would say that that upon this tombstone where we lay this person it'll have a date to the day that they were born and the day that they died but between those two dates is a dash and that dash represents everything that they did in life now maybe it was a person that was a mother and it would typify that dash we wouldn't see what that dash actually means but to the children that would mean everything to them it represented what mother was it represented that she was a good mother a godly mother it was her story that was laying there abraham lincoln said in the end it is not it is not the years in your life that matters it is the life that is in your years that matters there's a lot of things that will go that you'll go through in life but as long as jesus is on your side it doesn't matter what the test what the do what the what the enemy says and what the enemy testifies it matters what jesus says about your story satan would like to raise his ugly head and talk about your past and talk about what you did and your mistakes if satan is pointing you at your mistakes you point him at your future you point him at your strength if he's pointing at your weaknesses you point him to jesus if he's pointing you to sickness you point him to isaiah 53. if he's pointing you to your mistakes you point him to a god that wipes away all of your mistakes all of your sins all of your doubts and the bible says in micah chapter 7 and 8 rejoice not against me o my enemy and when i fall i shall arise it doesn't say if i fall it says i will fall and when i fall i shall arise and i shall though i sit in darkness i shall set in light again rejoice not against me satan if i fall there's a god that can raise me up if you're sitting in sickness rise to healing if you're setting him down rise to faith if you're setting in fear rise to love your story is powerful and it'll shake kingdoms the prophet would say that he's just looking for empty vessels that he can feel and shake the world with mary was a little girl 16 years old that her story that she was about to tell and her story that she was about to live out would never there would never be another person on the face of the earth that would have a story like mary's got and people go through life and they think you need to hear everything that i've went through you need to understand where i've been you have not lived a life like little mary had to live her story was so powerful that that the angel gabriel had to come and tell her of the story that she would carry out in life not only was this just a a normal story that would be told that you would read to your children at the end of the night to put them to sleep but this is the greatest story that has ever been told and ever will be told that this little girl 16 years old had a visitation from an angel and that angel told her that she would conceive in her womb and she would bring for the child and she would call his name jesus and he will save his people from their sins there's nobody that's got a story like mary when mary pushed out what was on the inside of her it was more than just an average man this was not part jew nor port gentile the story that she was producing from her womb would save you and save your mother save your father save the lost save the drug addict save the alcoholic mary's story started with an angel and that same angel's in this room tonight so that he can set your story on a course that you can say if you can go through these things and you can look up don't look down don't look back but look up he will take you to the spot that he predetermined his pre-destination has set your course when mary begin to tell her story there's power in your voice and when you begin to testify and when you begin to confess what he did your story is being lived out by your voice and mary begin to testify to her cousin elizabeth because the angel had told her about elizabeth's story what brought you here tonight the greatest story that was ever told and he is the author and the finisher of our faith he is the one that starts to work and he is the one that finishes the work and god is not a halfway god and neither is he in the business of creating halfway children if god has started a work in your life he will finish the story there's going to be authors that write great poets poetry they will write great books that will sell for millions of dollars but when the author writes your story and puts the end on it it is happily ever after your story is not a story of destruction your story is a story of victory your story is not a story of depression nor anxiety your story is a story of healing a story of miracles a story of joy and happiness and peace there might be somebody that raises up in your story and tries to put out your light but god is the one that's writing out the script and satan can do all he wants to to stop the story from coming but god knows the end and he knows your beginning he knows how to write the book and as mary begins to echo out of her soul the things that were laying there she began to tell what the angel said you ever been in that spot in the spot of a story when you're talking about more than a story when you're talking about life when you're talking about jesus you ever been in that spot of a story when you when you're testifying about what god did for you maybe you've been in that baby you've been in that's part of a story when you've been telling about somebody somebody's real close to you somebody went through cancer and somebody that was talked to by an angel said if you trust me i'll use you like never before and you begin to tell somebody else's story about this big god and you begin to tell that the doctors seen tumors in lungs they sing tumors in brains but now here we are on the other side of nine months and you're telling a story and in this story the doctors say that there is no there is no tumor seen in those lungs no more and all of a sudden there begin to be a visitation because of a story that was being told let me tell you about somebody else there was a man named paul that was known as a killer known as a murderer but one day he met this one that was going to finish his story not as saul but he would finish him as paul that would write 14 books of this bible and even though satan may hate paul with everything that's within him what paul was writing was inspired by the holy ghost it is our word and it will defeat satan anytime anyplace anywhere hallelujah satan wasn't trying to get saul when he was on one road but when he became paul the story changed you remember when your story changed you remember when it looked like the author was writing the book and you were just spiraling down a hill of chaos and all of a sudden the man with the pen made a complete change in the story maybe your story started at altar maybe your story started in a car when you were riding home but he changed your story but he's not writing your story with ink he's writing it with blood your story has the power to bring life when you go to telling about the author of life and you begin to testify and about the creator of life that he's the sustainer of life and you go to testifying about the story and the one that created and did a work in your life the name that is above every name you begin to testify about those things there's power in your story when mary began to tell her story there was something happening in a realm that could not be seen there was something supernatural that was happening because there had been a promise of a prophet that would be a forerunner to the messiah and when mary began to tell her story a little prophet that was on the inside of a womb that had been laying there dead because of mary's story it brought to life a dead prophet oh hallelujah when you go to telling about this holy ghost that there's power in the name of jesus christ it'll make dead people leap even though they may look like they're not in the womb but they're in the mind of god and you go to telling about the name of jesus and the power of jesus this story has the power to raise you out of your sin in your life she testified in the name of jesus christ because it was her story her story brought life to this world what will your story tell in the end what will be said of you what will be your legacy we started out last year with a theme that we will see miracles did we see them that was a story that you testified of before you ever seen them i want to tell you something that you already know faith don't make sense faith makes miracles satan perverts and he destroys life but god brings sons and daughters back to their rightful position years ago there was an elderly man and a son this elderly man was a widow man and had enormous amount of money but he was a very very particular man and he collected great works of art he cr he collected picasso he he he collected he collected monet and then go and he collected all of these things and he had created such a museum in his own home that his son as he watched his son that his son began to take on his own role of his father and he how he loved how he loved to look at those pieces of art and how he loved to collect pieces of picasso and monet and van gaal and they they sent them out throughout their monstrous house and they they placed them throughout the walls and they were watching and they were looking at the the power of the story that was being told in that piece of art because great men great men paint great things and picasso is painting out these things and he's telling a story and behind pieces of art there's a story that's being told and this son begin to grab a hold of his father's his father's vision of collecting these pieces of work and he the father began to swell up with pride and how he how he looked upon his son and his son would go after those pieces of art and he had the money to buy them so we'd go after pieces that nobody else would have well winter came and so did war and war came along and it come along and his son he got a note the father got a note that his son was missing in action and the father began to become very emotional thinking here we are we're going into the christmas season and my son's missing in action and you can imagine he's thinking the absolute worst i may never see my son again a few days later he heard word that his son the things that he thought was that he never wanted to hear his son had passed away in war he sat there in home and he looked out upon his beautiful pieces of art that nobody else in the world had but he said in a house that was lonely without a son without everything that he loved he had he had all the money that you could buy anything that you wanted he could buy but he had nobody to share his beauty with his greatest treasure in life had been taken from him and on christmas day as christmas rolled up and the man said in his home there was a knock on the door and as he walked down the hallway and all the pieces of art are just sitting there and they're staring at him as he's walking down through there and he cannot share his love with his son no more he walks up to the door and there's a soldier that is standing there it says sir i knew your son i was a friend this man had a package in his hand so i was the one that your son was trying to save and get me to a medic when he was killed in action said can i come in and could i talk with you a little bit and the soldier began to tell his father the father about his son how he loved the pieces of art how he talked about home and how we talked about the art that his father had collected about the pieces of picasso and van gogh and monet and all of these things he began to tell him about these and he said sir he said i'm an artist as well and he said i'd like to present this to you this piece of art that was drawn out was a picture of the wealthy man's son this soldier had painted this piece of art though it may not have been a stroke of genius to to great collectors but to the father it meant everything to him there was his son he'd captured his eyes he'd captured his he captured his youth he captured everything about him and as he's looking at it he sees his son and they begin to talk about it and the father tells the soldier he said i'm going to place this piece of art right here on the fireplace i'll push aside these other pieces and i'll set him right there sure enough as a soldier left that evening the father was as good as his word and he took that piece of art that that was presented by the soldier his son he placed it right there and he stared at it and he cried filled with emotion he's sitting and he's he's looking at his son on christmas day spring rolls and a man becomes ill when he passes away and everything and the art world is beginning to jump for joy and they're excited because now they have a chance to buy these great pieces of art they have an opportunity and the father had wrote in his will that that you that this auction must be done on christmas day when i receive my greatest gift so auction day pulls up christmas day comes around these great men from around the world world-renowned collectors of art they come to this man's estate where the auction is being held and they are just the the room and the place is just completely full of talking talking about this this this great art and they were bragging about how much money that they had brought so that they could buy these great pieces of art they would be the greatest collector put them in museums and the auctioneer beats his gavel and said let us start he said we have to start with this picture first it's a picture of the man's son a voice came from the back end said why why do we have to watch this first we come here for picasso we came here from van gaal from van gogh and monet we came here for these great things why do we have to look at these things so the auctioneer said it's what the father wanted so he starts and he beats his gavel and he said who will give a hundred dollars he makes calls he makes calls who he will give who will give a hundred dollars who'll give a hundred dollars people in the back begin to get mad and furious and begin to scream move on we want to see the million-dollar pieces he said this one must be sold first there was a voice in the back it said would you take fifty dollars it's all i've got i was a friend to the father i was a friend to the father i knew his son well he said sold for fifty dollars the great collectors begin to scream and get excited now we can move on now we can go forward now we can get on and the auctioneer screamed the auction is over they said we demand we demand we demand justice we came here for these great things we come here to buy these things explain to us what is going how can the auction be over with all of these millions of dollars of pieces that we've come here for he said the father had wrote it in the wheel that whoever takes a son gets all the things that he had in his house the bible said in romans 8 that whosoever how how thou sing father has given us freely all things he gave us a son how much more shall he give us all things your story may be told here tonight but if you don't receive the son you won't receive all things that the father has he's got healing in his wings he's got joy in his soul he's got peace like a river he's got deliverance he's got chain breaking power in the blood of jesus christ but if you don't receive the son you don't receive anything that the father has to give will your story be told that i received the son and i got more than paintings i got eternal life don't you stand with us this evening your story is powerful and it has the ability to bring life miracle working life he has the ability to send a fresh wind and
