[12:01] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[12:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Me, too.
[12:05] Well, I'm happy every day
[12:08] as I journey through this land.
[12:12] I've been mighty, mighty, blessed by
[12:15] God. I'm a holding to his hand.
[12:20] The journey is almost over.
[12:24] The battle is almost won,
[12:28] but I got a feeling down in my heart.
[12:32] The best is yet to come.
[12:36] Oh, the best is yet to come.
[12:43] &gt;&gt; For the first time, I see Jesus.
[12:48] I can hardly wait.
[12:51] He'll show me to my man.
[12:56] This is your new home.
[12:59] But I got a feeling down in my heart.
[13:03] The best is
[13:09] Now I'm standing on the banks of old
[13:12] Jordan.
[13:13] And I'm watching the rolling tide.
[13:17] Storms of life raging all around me. But
[13:21] I'm happy down inside.
[13:24] [Music]
[13:25] see my life come.
[13:29] Want to carry you safely home.
[13:33] And I got a feeling down in my heart.
[13:37] The best is yet to come.
[13:41] Oh, the best is yet to come.
[13:44] [Music]
[13:48] Well, the first time I see Jesus,
[13:54] I can hardly wait.
[13:57] He'll show me to my man.
[14:01] This is your new home.
[14:04] But I got a feeling down in my heart.
[14:08] The best is yet to come. One more time.
[14:12] Second verse. Well, standing on the
[14:16] banks of old Jordan,
[14:18] watching the rolling tide,
[14:22] storms of life raging all around me, but
[14:26] I'm happy down inside.
[14:30] See my life overcome.
[14:34] Want to carry safely home.
[14:38] But I got a feeling down in my heart.
[14:42] The best is yet to come.
[14:46] [Music]
[14:48] The best is yet to come. When I walk
[14:53] heaven's gate,
[14:56] well, the first time that I see Jesus,
[15:01] I can hardly wait.
[15:05] [Music]
[15:08] This is your new home.
[15:12] And I got a feeling down in my heart.
[15:16] The best is yet to come.
[15:20] Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand clap of
[15:22] praise.
[15:24] Thank you, Lord, that we know today the
[15:27] best is yet to come.
[15:30] Hallelujah.
[15:32] I believe it was Brother Ron said for us
[15:36] that's going over, this is as close to
[15:38] hell as we'll ever get. So, just think
[15:40] about the goodness we got coming.
[15:42] &gt;&gt; Paul said, "Eyes have not seen, ears
[15:44] have not heard,
[15:45] &gt;&gt; but we got a prophet that the Lord
[15:46] allowed to go over and take a peek and
[15:48] come back and tell us." I even got a zoo
[15:50] that'll be there with me. Hallelujah.
[15:55] Apparently, the Lord likes zoos.
[15:58] The good old gospel ship.
[16:03] Well, I'm going to take a trip on that
[16:06] good old gospel ship.
[16:09] I'm going far beyond the sky.
[16:16] Well, not
[16:18] sing
[16:20] until the heavens
[16:23] when I
[16:25] this old world goodbye.
[16:30] Well, I got good news to bring
[16:34] and that is why I sing. All my joy with
[16:40] you I share.
[16:45] Well, I'm going to take
[16:48] one that good old gospel
[16:52] and go sailing
[16:54] through
[16:56] the air.
[16:59] Well, I'm going to take a trip on that
[17:04] good old gospel ship.
[17:07] I'm going far beyond the sky.
[17:15] I'm going to shout and sing
[17:18] until the heavens ring. When I be this
[17:23] old world
[17:25] goodbye,
[17:29] well, I can scarcely wait.
[17:34] [Applause]
[17:36] All my time I spend
[17:40] in prayer.
[17:44] And when my ship comes in, I'm going to
[17:48] leave this old world sea.
[17:51] and go sailing
[17:54] through
[17:56] the air.
[17:59] Yes, I'm going to take a trip on that
[18:03] good old gospel ship.

[18:18] until the heavens free when I be this
[18:24] old world

[18:30] your shame of me.
[18:33] You have no right with me. For with
[18:38] Christ
[18:39] I am an air.
[18:45] Oh, too much more to find. Well, you'll
[18:49] surely be left behind while I'm sailing
[18:55] through the air.
[19:00] Hell, I'm going to take a trip on that
[19:04] good old gospel sh
[19:07] I'm going far beyond
[19:11] the sky.
[19:16] I'm going to shout and sing

[24:59] dance. also got something he's been
[25:01] fighting for a while. Maybe you have an
[25:04] unspoken request this evening on your
[25:06] heart. You'd like to lift it before the
[25:07] Lord. Our hands, God knows each and
[25:11] every need. Lord, I'd like to ask
[25:13] brother Chris Morris if you would come
[25:15] take these prayers to the Lord for us
[25:18] this evening. As brother Chris prays,
[25:21] you pray too. Take one of them on your
[25:23] heart.
[25:25] I believe he hears our prayers and
[25:26] answers them.
[25:28] &gt;&gt; We believe that.
[25:29] Amen.
[25:32] Amen. Let's all just pray and believe
[25:34] together. Our gracious father, as we
[25:36] just come to you, Lord,
[25:39] and Father, what a mighty God we serve.
[25:41] And Lord, what a mighty God that knows
[25:43] the end from the beginning. And Father,
[25:46] you want us to come and and ask in
[25:49] abundance so our joys might be full. But
[25:52] Lord, there's some sick sheep here.
[25:55] and father by cancer and
[25:59] what the devil's put on these brothers
[26:03] and sisters and we just praying father
[26:06] that we know there's nothing too hard
[26:08] for you and cancer is just a toothache
[26:11] we just ask you Lord just to come and
[26:14] meet the needs of your children
[26:16] and father we know as we see the
[26:18] closeness of the hour we see the times
[26:21] at hand we see father handwriting on the
[26:24] wall and lord Lord, it just can't be
[26:26] much longer that this little bride's got
[26:28] to suffer all the elements of this life.
[26:31] But, Father, one day we'll get a new
[26:33] body.
[26:34] One day soon, Lord, the trials will be
[26:37] over.
[26:38] And if we knew the the big picture, if
[26:40] we knew what was in store, if we really
[26:43] knew down in our heart, Father, things
[26:45] attitude would be different. And we're
[26:48] just praying, Lord Jesus, tonight, Lord,
[26:51] that you'll come and help us. And
[26:54] father, there's one in here, just one.
[26:57] If there's more, there's wonderful, but
[27:00] Lord, if there's one that don't know
[27:02] they got the Holy Ghost, that don't know
[27:04] they're saved. Lord, the body's going to
[27:07] get sick. It'll get sick. It will get
[27:09] healed and get sick. But Father, you do
[27:10] the healing. But Father, that soul,
[27:13] their destination
[27:16] is one breath away from an eternal
[27:18] decision.
[27:20] So, Father, we're asking you, Lord, to
[27:23] find that last one as Brother Ron and
[27:27] Brother Andrew and Brother Matt's up
[27:28] there in Canada preaching. And Father,
[27:31] it may be that the last one's up there.
[27:34] &gt;&gt; And if it is, Lord, we're ready to go.
[27:38] And Father, we just pray Lord for
[27:40] Brother William.
[27:42] &gt;&gt; May the my brothers step aside, Lord.
[27:45] You got a vessel you can use,
[27:47] a vessel that can feed your sheep.
[27:50] And Lord, you know what we've went
[27:52] through this week. You know what we went
[27:54] through last week. And Father, you know
[27:56] what we're going to go through. So,
[27:59] Father, use our brother in a special
[28:00] way. Lord, bless him, we pray. Bless the
[28:04] service. We ask in Jesus Christ's name.
[28:06] We love and appreciate you in Jesus
[28:08] name. Amen.

[41:06] Amen.
[41:09] Oh, taste and see. I tasted a lot of
[41:12] things in this world, but once that day
[41:14] came and I tasted the Lord, I knew there
[41:16] was nothing like him.
[41:18] &gt;&gt; He's He's got the answer to every
[41:20] problem. And I tell you, and he loves us
[41:21] like nobody else.

[41:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we're here tonight. and we got
[41:30] an opportunity to reach out and touch
[41:32] the Lord. Won't you stand with me as we
[41:34] prepare here in a moment to invite
[41:36] Brother William? You know, the Lord, he
[41:38] ain't about wasting his time. So, if
[41:40] we're here, he's got a word for us
[41:41] tonight.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; And all we got to do is pull on that
[41:44] gift. Just touch the hymn of his garment
[41:46] as he's coming by.
[41:50] He is here.

[44:45] his name.
[44:48] Touching Jesus.
[44:51] Oh, touching Jesus
[44:55] is all
[44:57] that really matterers.
[45:04] Then your life
[45:06] [Music]
[45:07] will never

[46:03] Yes. Jesus be the Lord of all.
[46:08] Jesus be the Lord of all.
[46:14] Jesus be the Lord of all the kingoms of
[46:21] my heart.
[46:24] And Jesus I surrender all.
[46:30] Jesus I surrender all.
[46:35] [Music]
[46:44] Let's sing that again. Jesus, I

[47:11] of all.
[47:13] Jesus be the Lord of all.
[47:18] Jesus be the Lord of all. The kingom of
[47:26] my heart.
[47:28] Amen. Is that your desire this evening
[47:30] to let the Lord Jesus be the Lord over
[47:34] all? Amen. And you know, for him to be
[47:35] Lord, you got to open every every door
[47:38] to your heart.
[47:40] &gt;&gt; He wants He don't just want to be your
[47:42] savior. He wants to be your Lord and
[47:44] Savior. Amen. God bless you. It's so
[47:46] good to see your smiling faces in the
[47:48] house of the Lord. It's certainly an
[47:49] honor and privilege to be gathered
[47:51] together. Amen. On this Saturday
[47:53] evening, trust you all had a wonderful
[47:54] week.
[47:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. We want to continue to remember
[47:58] our pastors there in Canada as they
[47:59] minister the word of the Lord. that God
[48:01] will just strengthen them and bless them
[48:03] and bless the meetings as as we know he
[48:05] is. And he's just so faithful.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; He's faithful in Canada. He's faithful
[48:09] in Africa. He's faithful in China. And
[48:12] he's faithful in Virginia. Amen.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. If you'll just
[48:17] we'll just go to the word of the Lord.
[48:18] Thank you, musicians. Go to the word of
[48:20] the Lord. And we'll read in several
[48:22] places here, but we'll begin with Amos
[48:24] 3.
[48:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:26] &gt;&gt; And Malachi 4. some very very familiar
[48:29] passages of scripture there.
[48:32] Trust it'll be a blessing to you. Amos
[48:35] 3:7,
[48:39] the Bible says, "Surely the Lord God
[48:42] will do nothing,
[48:44] but he revealth his secret unto his
[48:47] servants, the prophets. The lion hath
[48:50] roared, who will not fear? The Lord God
[48:54] hath spoken.
[48:56] Who can but prophesy? Amen. In Malachi
[48:58] chapter 4, we'll begin with verse five.
[49:03] Most of us could probably quote this by
[49:05] heart. But you know, even though so
[49:07] common, even though it's so common to
[49:08] us, we could quote it by heart. May it
[49:10] never become common to our hearts.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; Behold, I will send you Elijah the
[49:16] prophet before the coming of the great
[49:19] and dreadful day of the Lord. And he
[49:21] shall turn the heart of the fathers to
[49:23] the children, and the heart of the
[49:25] children to their fathers, lest I come
[49:27] and smite the earth with a curse. How
[49:30] many of you identify with that
[49:32] scripture?
[49:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our heads and our
[49:34] hearts.
[49:35] &gt;&gt; Dear gracious heavenly father, as we
[49:37] come, Lord Jesus, in your presence and
[49:39] father god, Lord, we just realize and
[49:41] are so conscious of our insufficiency,
[49:43] Lord, and we just put all we cast all of
[49:45] our cares upon you, Lord. We look unto
[49:47] you for this service. You've gathered us
[49:49] together here, Lord. You've placed these
[49:51] simple thoughts upon my heart for a
[49:53] reason. And Lord, I just pray that you
[49:55] help me, Lord God, to get out of the
[49:57] way. Bless your people. May they just
[49:59] hear the word of the Lord, Father. Not
[50:01] from a man, but Lord, from the mind of
[50:02] God. We just pray that you close my
[50:04] mouth to anything, Lord, I shouldn't
[50:06] say. And Lord, may you just open my
[50:08] mouth to everything I should. We love
[50:09] you. We give you all the praise, honor,
[50:11] and glory in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[50:13] Amen. God bless you as you're seated.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; Tonight, with the help of the Lord, I
[50:18] just have a very simple thought here. I
[50:19] like to title this, what is the message?
[50:25] &gt;&gt; What is the message? You know, we our
[50:27] church is growing and and and there's
[50:29] there's new people amongst us and and I
[50:31] just was kind of praying and asking the
[50:33] Lord what I I what what to share on and
[50:36] he kind of put this on my heart and it
[50:38] wouldn't leave.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; It wouldn't leave. So, I felt like
[50:41] there's a reason for it. So, that's what
[50:42] I just like to preach on. What is the
[50:44] message? And it's not just for those
[50:47] that say maybe new amongst us, but even
[50:48] for those of us that have grown up in
[50:50] it, that have been around it. May may I
[50:52] pray that the Lord will just help us to
[50:54] receive something fresh and maybe if
[50:56] nothing else, have a new appreciation
[50:59] for the message of the hour because the
[51:02] truth of this message and what God has
[51:03] done for us can never ever
[51:07] be overemphasized.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; God has called us out. And may may this
[51:11] also just be as as a foundation because
[51:14] every Christian needs a foundation
[51:16] because you go out there and you get
[51:18] amongst all kinds of people and Satan
[51:20] will test you.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; You read your Bible and you read
[51:23] something and the enemy will come to you
[51:25] and test you on your faith. Brother
[51:27] Jerry, you'll hear the prophet say
[51:29] something and the enemy is going to test
[51:32] you on your faith. So I think it's very
[51:34] important for us to have a strong
[51:36] foundation in what we believe and why we
[51:39] believe it. we must understand, you
[51:41] know, and then as as when when these
[51:43] other brothers get up and they begin to
[51:44] preach and God has placed a powerful
[51:46] message on their hearts, they may just
[51:48] drop some details and maybe mention a
[51:50] word or maybe mention the third pull and
[51:52] keep going. They're under the anointing
[51:54] and God's given them a sermon. So, I
[51:56] pray that this sermon will kind of take
[51:58] a step back and lay a foundation and
[52:00] give you a background to where when they
[52:02] mention something, you understand it.
[52:04] Because whenever you understand what's
[52:06] being preached, that's real faith.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; Okay? To understand and be able to grasp
[52:12] and say, "I get it." And that's why we
[52:14] should always be in the word. You read
[52:16] during the week. You you keep your mind
[52:18] on the Lord and you come to church and
[52:19] you'll hear things that you are having a
[52:21] very private discussion with your
[52:24] spouse, your family, maybe even the Lord
[52:26] himself.
[52:28] So again, may this just be a basis
[52:32] because even though we've heard it in
[52:33] our own lives, our whole lives, it's
[52:36] important to understand. Amen. The
[52:38] scripture says in second Peter 1:16,
[52:40] "For we have not followed
[52:43] cunningly devised fables when we made
[52:46] known unto you the power and coming of
[52:48] our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were
[52:50] eyewitnesses of his majesty."
[52:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; This message lives. That's right.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; This message is freedom. This message is
[53:01] literally the love of God to you.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; When millions, the prophet would make a
[53:08] statement like this. Millions died the
[53:11] day I was saved.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; Millions go to the grave and have never
[53:16] heard this message.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; But yet God in his grace has allowed it
[53:21] to cross your path. That's right.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would make a statement
[53:25] in the church age book and he would say,
[53:28] "I wonder if we are sufficiently
[53:30] impressed with the word in our midst."
[53:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; And I believe that puts a conviction on
[53:35] all of us.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we get so used to to hearing
[53:39] truth and we love the truth, but you
[53:41] don't we don't we we sometimes can lose
[53:43] lose sight of how what the famine that
[53:45] is out there,
[53:46] &gt;&gt; the famine for the truth and the word.
[53:48] and we go home and we listen to it and
[53:50] we read it and we hear sermons and we're
[53:52] just such a blessed people.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; We're not just another church,
[53:58] &gt;&gt; right?
[53:59] &gt;&gt; We are the bride of Jesus Christ. We
[54:03] believe the message of the hour. But
[54:04] what does this mean? How does this
[54:07] separate us from every other Christian
[54:09] church and denomination?
[54:12] &gt;&gt; Now, let me say this. God has an
[54:15] economy.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; And there will be millions and millions
[54:19] of people in heaven and saved that have
[54:21] never heard this message.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; But once it's crossed your path,
[54:27] &gt;&gt; you're then responsible for it.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; The people that have never heard it and
[54:32] all they know is the preaching of the
[54:33] cross and the fundamental teaching of
[54:35] the Bible and they accept and they
[54:38] believe and they're saved, that's their
[54:40] that's their portion. But for us, God
[54:42] has given us something special.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; Now Jesus would make a statement in St.
[54:48] John 15:22. If I had not come and spoken
[54:52] unto them, they had not had sin. But now
[54:55] they have no cloak for their sin.
[54:58] &gt;&gt; Right?
[54:59] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God would make would
[55:00] would would say something really
[55:01] powerful
[55:04] in a sermon called God's word calls for
[55:06] a total separation of from unbelief.
[55:11] And he makes this statement. He says,
[55:13] "You pull out a bunch of change."
[55:16] He said, "There's pennies, nickels,
[55:19] dimes, quarters, half dollars, dollar,
[55:21] all in coins." Now, that's what the
[55:24] world is in God's hand.
[55:28] He said, "There are some people that can
[55:30] just have a penny's worth of it, and God
[55:32] can only use them in a penny way.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; That's all they can buy. Don't reject
[55:39] them." That's right.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; If they can't believe the real truth,
[55:41] don't turn them down. Don't kick them
[55:43] out and say they're not in it because
[55:45] God uses pennies sometimes.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; Now, this isn't an arrogant quote. This
[55:51] isn't an arrogant statement to say, you
[55:53] know, oh, you're a penny. But this is
[55:56] actually a very inclusive quote.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; This is a very inclusive quote because
[56:01] we need the pennies.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; We need the nickels. We need the dimes.
[56:05] We need the quarters. They're in God's
[56:07] economy. The important thing is that
[56:09] they're in God's hand.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; That's right. There it is.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; And as long as they're in God's hand,
[56:13] God has a use and God has a purpose for
[56:16] them.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; But now he goes on, he says, "Lot was
[56:20] just a penny. Abraham was a silver
[56:23] dollar."
[56:25] &gt;&gt; So it's taken a 100 lots to make an
[56:27] Abraham.
[56:29] A hundred carnal believers. And so will
[56:31] it take a hundred carnal believers will
[56:33] never stand in the presence of a genuine
[56:36] Christian. that's separated from the
[56:38] carnal things of the world, living in
[56:40] Jesus in Christ Jesus where the word can
[56:43] flow through him.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; The bride is a silver dollar in his
[56:47] hand.
[56:49] &gt;&gt; But don't reject if your neighbor's a
[56:51] nickel.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; Appreciate the nickel.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; Pray for the nickel.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; God has a purpose for him.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; But we're But God has called us to be
[57:03] the bride. And we say that humbly
[57:05] because that's what he did for us.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; St. John 1:1, in the beginning was the
[57:11] word and the word was with God and the
[57:13] word was God. Now the keystone of the
[57:15] Bible is the revelation that God never
[57:19] changes.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad to ser be servant of God
[57:23] that never changes?
[57:26] &gt;&gt; He He's predictable. Now sometimes he
[57:28] does paradoxes and he can work in
[57:30] unexpected ways but he is very he will
[57:33] fulfill his word and what he did
[57:34] yesterday he's going to do today and
[57:37] he'll always do.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; Now there's three races of people in the
[57:41] world. There's there's gentile there's
[57:45] Jews and there's Samaritans.
[57:48] &gt;&gt; Now when God came in the flesh in the
[57:51] Lord Jesus Christ he expressed himself
[57:53] in the Jewish nation of Israel. Amen.
[57:55] And what did the Jews do? We know they
[57:57] crucified him. They rejected him. And
[57:59] after the days of Pentecost, whenever
[58:01] the ministry of Jesus Christ was then
[58:03] transferred from his own flesh into the
[58:05] apostles and the 120, the Jews continued
[58:09] to reject the Lord Jesus.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; Right?
[58:12] &gt;&gt; So in Acts 13, Paul turned he said that
[58:15] be the the Jews kept coming against kept
[58:17] coming against the word. So he says the
[58:19] Gentiles were loving it,
[58:21] &gt;&gt; but the Jews were rejecting it and
[58:23] constantly trying to stone him and hated
[58:25] for it. And so Paul stood there as a
[58:27] prophet messenger and said, "Lo, we now
[58:30] turn to the Gentiles."
[58:34] &gt;&gt; And and and right now we're on the cusp
[58:36] of low, God is turning back to the Jews,
[58:39] but there's still we're still in the
[58:40] dispensation
[58:42] of the Gentiles. All right.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; Now, after Pentecost in the in in the
[58:49] region, there were seven there were a
[58:52] bunch of churches, but in particular,
[58:54] there were seven physical, geographical,
[58:57] literal churches,
[58:59] &gt;&gt; right,
[58:59] &gt;&gt; that existed. That's
[59:00] &gt;&gt; right.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; And these churches were so prophetic in
[59:06] in the in in their their ways they would
[59:08] approach the word. God, they actually
[59:11] prophesied of entire ages to come,
[59:13] &gt;&gt; right?
[59:14] &gt;&gt; Like the first church age is the Ephesus
[59:16] church age, the Ephesians, but there was
[59:18] literally a church in Ephesus.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; And the first church in Ephesus there,
[59:22] they begin to drift away and lose the
[59:25] passion and the love for the word. And
[59:27] so they literally forecasted, Sister
[59:29] Stephanie, they literally forecasted the
[59:32] entire Ephesian church age by their
[59:34] actions.
[59:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. And there were seven churches and
[59:38] God put them in the Bible in the book of
[59:39] Revelation and he named them all and
[59:42] they were to project future ages. Right?
[59:46] &gt;&gt; In Revelations 1, we'll read in verse
[59:49] 10, John speaking, I was in the spirit
[59:52] on the Lord's day and heard behind me a
[59:54] great voice as of a trumpet, saying, I
[59:56] am Alpha and Omega, the first and the
[59:58] last. what thou seeest, write in a book,
[1:00:01] and send it unto the seven churches
[1:00:03] which are in Asia, unto Ephesus, and
[1:00:05] into Somra, and unto Pergamos, and into
[1:00:07] Titara, and to Sardis, unto
[1:00:08] Philadelphia, and unto Leodysia.
[1:00:11] And I turned to see the voice that spake
[1:00:14] with me being turned, and I saw seven
[1:00:18] golden candlesticks.
[1:00:20] Now, these seven golden candlesticks,
[1:00:23] each candlestick represented a church
[1:00:26] age,
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; right? And Jesus himself later in the
[1:00:28] book of revelation there he actually
[1:00:30] interprets it there that says that the
[1:00:32] seven candlesticks that you seen are the
[1:00:35] seven church ages.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:00:41] And then and then in verse verse verse
[1:00:43] four of chapter one John to the seven
[1:00:46] churches which are in Asia. Grace be
[1:00:48] unto you and peace from him which is and
[1:00:50] which was and which was which is to
[1:00:53] come. and from the seven spirits which
[1:00:55] are before the his throne. Now, seven
[1:00:58] spirits refer to the continuous ministry
[1:01:03] of the Holy Spirit in the lives of seven
[1:01:06] men.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; Whom God identifies himself very
[1:01:12] closely. That's
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; There are seven church ages and there's
[1:01:18] seven church age messengers. That's
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; right. that God sends to every single
[1:01:24] age.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; This is really fundamental
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; but I want us all to really grab a hold
[1:01:32] of it
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; now. The seven spirits are not seven
[1:01:37] separate spirits.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; They are the same spirit but given in
[1:01:41] seven portions.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; So whenever the fir whenever the Ephesus
[1:01:46] age needed it, God would release his
[1:01:47] messenger and release the spirit with
[1:01:50] that messenger.
[1:01:53] Now,
[1:01:54] each church age messenger, as I said, he
[1:01:57] had a he was a special handpicked man
[1:02:00] that God would use to get the people
[1:02:03] back to the word and they were
[1:02:05] represented in the scripture as stars.
[1:02:09] In Revelation 1:16, it says, "And he had
[1:02:11] in his right hand, which is a symbol of
[1:02:13] power, he had seven stars."
[1:02:18] And Jesus later interprets that and
[1:02:20] says, "The mystery of the seven stars
[1:02:21] which thou sawest in my right hand and
[1:02:24] the seven golden candlesticks, the stars
[1:02:26] are the angels of the seven church ages.
[1:02:30] And the seven candlesticks which thou
[1:02:31] sawest are the seven church ages,
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; So they're in his right hand.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; And as as the church age began, God
[1:02:40] needed to keep because God is concerned
[1:02:42] about his bride and his wife."
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:46] And the first bride, Eve, she fell.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; And God wasn't going to have another Eve
[1:02:52] to fall like that.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; So whenever she started to drift away,
[1:02:57] God then begin to release messengers and
[1:03:00] stars. He then released a star for each
[1:03:02] age.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; Now there there also whenever the Bible
[1:03:06] talks about the eyes, there's seven
[1:03:08] spirits. There's seven stars. There's
[1:03:11] seven eyes. The stars and the spirits,
[1:03:14] they represent the the the the seven
[1:03:16] spirits. Each spirit represented and
[1:03:19] came with the star. That's
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; But it was all the Holy Ghost.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; And Psalm 32:8
[1:03:27] says, "I will instruct thee and teach
[1:03:28] thee in the way which thou shalt go. I
[1:03:31] will guide thee with mine eye."
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; So God would release the star. Ephesus,
[1:03:38] he released Paul.
[1:03:41] Then time went by. Samrna, he released
[1:03:43] Ireneius.
[1:03:45] Then Pergamos came and he released
[1:03:47] Martin. Thyra came, he released
[1:03:50] Columbus. Sardis came, he released
[1:03:52] Martin Luther. Philadelphia came, he
[1:03:55] released John Wesley.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; And then Leosa.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; He released William Brandham.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; Do you hear me? hell.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; He released William Brandon
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; and we're not ashamed of that.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; We're not ashamed of this message.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; We love this message. We love the
[1:04:21] prophet and we love the message he
[1:04:23] brought
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; and we believe it with all of our hearts
[1:04:27] and it's going to change our bodies.
[1:04:29] That's right.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; Now that this book, this Bible was
[1:04:33] sealed with seven seals
[1:04:36] in Revelations 5. It was sealed with
[1:04:38] seven seals. And God held this book
[1:04:40] sealed throughout all the ages because
[1:04:43] it's opening tied to his coming.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; All right?
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; And so he hid it hid because remember
[1:04:48] when he was on the earth, he said, "No
[1:04:50] man knows when when the father's coming.
[1:04:52] Not even the angels in heaven know." It
[1:04:54] was such a secret. And he held it sealed
[1:04:57] for seven church ages. But at the end of
[1:04:59] the seventh church age, God releases a
[1:05:02] seventh star. Because look, Paul was not
[1:05:05] just a messenger. Paul was a prophet
[1:05:08] messenger.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; And then through the church ages, you
[1:05:13] had reformers.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; They weren't prophet messengers. There
[1:05:18] were someone that that God had his hand
[1:05:19] on, and they were to keep the elect pure
[1:05:21] for every age. But at the Alpha and the
[1:05:24] Omega, God sends a special man.
[1:05:29] a prophet messenger to get the word in
[1:05:31] order. The pillar of fire was identified
[1:05:34] with Paul and the pillar of fire is
[1:05:36] identified
[1:05:38] with William Brandham.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; So this Bible was sealed with seven
[1:05:44] seals
[1:05:46] and no man was even worthy to look on
[1:05:48] it.
[1:05:50] In Revelations 5, John is weeping and
[1:05:53] wailing because no man is worthy and
[1:05:56] it's got to be unsealed. It's got to be
[1:05:59] open
[1:06:01] if we're to be redeemed.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; All the Old Testament saints are all
[1:06:05] waiting. We're all waiting.
[1:06:08] The New Testament saints that have died
[1:06:10] during the church age, we're all waiting
[1:06:11] for this for the lamb to come take the
[1:06:13] book. That's
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; But there was a promise. Don't you love
[1:06:18] it when when there's a problem, but then
[1:06:21] God has already got the promise and the
[1:06:23] answer already here.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; The answer is already there. The answer
[1:06:28] to all of our problems is already here.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; We've just got to believe it. We've got
[1:06:33] to take it for ourselves. But in
[1:06:35] Revelations 10:7, it says, "But in the
[1:06:37] days of the voice of the seventh angel,
[1:06:39] when he shall begin to sound, the
[1:06:41] mystery of God should be finished as he
[1:06:44] hath declared to his servants the
[1:06:46] prophets."
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; Revelations 10 is the same like Malachi
[1:06:51] 4.
[1:06:52] Now look, his ministry was not an
[1:06:55] exactly a specific truth, but it was to
[1:06:57] gather all the loose ends.
[1:07:02] the church ages they there were they
[1:07:04] were to to keep the elect pure as pure
[1:07:06] as possible while the book was still
[1:07:08] sealed but they didn't have all of the
[1:07:10] truth there were still some things let
[1:07:13] me give you an example Martin Luther
[1:07:16] baptized in titles
[1:07:18] people were baptized in titles and God
[1:07:21] still gave them the Holy Ghost why would
[1:07:22] God do that because the book was sealed
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; right now
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; they didn't know any better but now we
[1:07:29] know
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; now we know better. Now, God's not going
[1:07:32] to accept Father, Son, and Holy Ghost
[1:07:34] baptism. He ain't going to give you the
[1:07:36] Holy Ghost with Trinity baptism. Why?
[1:07:38] Because the book's open. And now we know
[1:07:40] better.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; Now, the prophet's ministry, this this
[1:07:47] put a lot of pressure on me, Brother
[1:07:49] Matt, because to take a title like this,
[1:07:52] what is the message, and try and have an
[1:07:54] hour to try and bring it all together
[1:07:56] without missing the important parts, you
[1:07:58] talk about stress.
[1:08:01] So if I miss your favorite parts, please
[1:08:03] forgive me.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; Because what is the message really is
[1:08:11] every sermon that's preached across this
[1:08:12] pullpit.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; It's it it it's preaching to us what the
[1:08:17] message is. It's just from a different
[1:08:18] angle. But to from a factual fundamental
[1:08:22] standpoint to take what is the message
[1:08:24] and bottle it all down to one hour is
[1:08:28] was very difficult. and we'll just get
[1:08:29] as far as we can. Y'all pray for me.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; But now, why did we need a restoration?
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; Why did God have to send a prophet?
[1:08:41] Because remember when as soon as
[1:08:43] remember the the day of Pentecost was
[1:08:46] like the Garden of Eden. So whenever God
[1:08:49] created Adam and there that masterpiece
[1:08:51] was just so beautiful, Satan wasn't
[1:08:53] going to stick around and let that
[1:08:54] happen.
[1:08:56] He came in and he spoiled the picture.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; Well, when the when the day of Pentecost
[1:09:00] came, 120 people, the entire church had
[1:09:03] the Holy Ghost and they were out tearing
[1:09:05] up Satan's kingdom,
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; Satan wasn't going to leave it that way.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; So, he began to eat and he began to the
[1:09:12] Antichrist spirit. You read the first,
[1:09:14] second, the epistles of John. The
[1:09:16] antichrist spirit then was already
[1:09:18] beginning to work.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; And John was beginning to warn them,
[1:09:22] watch out for that antichrist spirit. If
[1:09:25] any spirit comes around and says that
[1:09:26] Jesus is not the Christ, that is that
[1:09:28] Antichrist spirit. Be careful, little
[1:09:31] children. Watch out. He's going to come
[1:09:33] among you. That's
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; So, what happened? That's what he did.
[1:09:36] They in Ephesus, they already begin to
[1:09:38] drift. And what happened? The next
[1:09:40] church age, they drifted more and they
[1:09:42] drifted more and they drifted all the
[1:09:44] way into a dark age.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; Why was it called the dark ages? Because
[1:09:51] people didn't have access to the word.
[1:09:53] That's
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:09:54] You could literally be burned to the
[1:09:56] stake for owning one of these. That's
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; For translating one of these,
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; you could literally go to the
[1:10:07] guillotine. You could literally go into
[1:10:09] the coliseum, whatever form of
[1:10:10] persecution. Now, God had that anointing
[1:10:12] there for them, but it was the dark
[1:10:15] ages. So, the the it was eaten all the
[1:10:18] way down in Joel 2:25, it tells about
[1:10:20] it. It was eaten all the way down to the
[1:10:22] stump. And God had a promise laying
[1:10:24] there again. And he said, "I will
[1:10:26] restore."
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; God is a God of restoration. He's going
[1:10:30] to restore. He said, "All in verse 25,
[1:10:33] and I will restore to you the years that
[1:10:35] the locust hath eaten, the cankerworm,
[1:10:37] the caterpillar, and the palmer worm,
[1:10:39] which my great army, which I sent among
[1:10:41] you. and ye shall eat in plenty and be
[1:10:44] satisfied and praise the name of the
[1:10:46] Lord your God that hath dealt wondously
[1:10:49] with you and my people shall never be
[1:10:51] ashamed.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; When Adam and Eve fell in the Garden of
[1:10:55] Eden, did he leave it like that?
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; When the second Eve fell after
[1:11:01] Pentecost, not after the as the apostles
[1:11:04] are starting to die, they begin to fail.
[1:11:05] Did God leave it like that?
[1:11:08] He didn't leave it like that. That's
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; right. So there had to come to return us
[1:11:12] back to the faith that once was
[1:11:15] delivered to the saints. The faith that
[1:11:17] Paul has, you have.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; The faith that Peter had, you have.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; The faith that John had, you have.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; The same Holy Ghost. That's
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; That literally the literally the same
[1:11:32] Holy Spirit, brother Timothy, that fell
[1:11:34] on the day of Pentecost. we have access
[1:11:37] to
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; literally not figuratively not
[1:11:40] spiritually it is spiritual but what I
[1:11:42] mean is it's the literal life of Jesus
[1:11:45] Christ
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; that's right there
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; think about how wonderful that is
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; now this church age saints still had the
[1:11:53] Holy Ghost
[1:11:55] but it wasn't in this it wasn't with
[1:11:57] this truth that's why they had to go by
[1:12:00] way of the grave because only the full
[1:12:03] word can take a body change a rapture
[1:12:07] What did the Bible say about Enoch?
[1:12:10] That he walked with God
[1:12:13] and that God changed him.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; And when you read about the heroes of
[1:12:17] faith, it says that Enoch pleased God.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; And it pleased God. It pleased God to
[1:12:22] change him.
[1:12:24] Now, God uses God sent Elijah more than
[1:12:27] once. God uses the spirit of Elijah five
[1:12:31] times in the Bible.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:33] There was Elijah,
[1:12:36] Elisha,
[1:12:38] John the Baptist,
[1:12:40] William Brham, and the last Elijah
[1:12:43] that's going to go. And Elijah when he
[1:12:45] goes back to the Jews five times,
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; That spirit served him so well
[1:12:52] that he sent it again.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:12:55] But and and watch each time that an
[1:12:58] Elijah ministry is on the earth, there's
[1:13:00] always an Ahab and a Jezebel to go with
[1:13:02] it. Have you ever noticed that?
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; Ahab and Jezebel was was with Elijah and
[1:13:07] Elisha.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; You had Herod and Herodiius
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; with John the Baptist.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; You have modern day Ahab, USA.
[1:13:21] Modernday Jezebel, the Catholic Church.
[1:13:23] That's right.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; And it's going to go all the way to the
[1:13:26] end. Elijah that goes to the Jews is
[1:13:27] going to have to deal with the same Ahab
[1:13:28] and Jezebel.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; Because remember Herod, he he actually
[1:13:33] secretly admired John the Baptist.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; Just like whenever Elijah pronounced
[1:13:37] Ahab's doom, Ahab humbled himself. But
[1:13:41] that Jezebel was controlling him. Now in
[1:13:44] Matthew 17 verse 10 and his disciples
[1:13:48] speaking about John the Baptist asked
[1:13:49] him saying why then say the scribes that
[1:13:52] Elijah must first come and Jesus
[1:13:54] answered and said unto them Elijah truly
[1:13:58] shall first come and restore all things.
[1:14:03] That's brother Brandham right there
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; he shall surely come. That was future.
[1:14:08] Now watch the next verse in verse 12.
[1:14:10] But I say unto you that Elias Elijah is
[1:14:13] come already. There's your John the
[1:14:14] Baptist.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; And they knew him not, but have done
[1:14:18] unto him whatsoever they listed.
[1:14:20] Likewise shall also the son of man
[1:14:23] suffer of them. Now God not only had to
[1:14:27] raise the seventh church age messenger,
[1:14:29] but God even had to reveal to the
[1:14:30] messenger who he was.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; He didn't just walk out. He was born of
[1:14:35] a woman, born in sin, shaped in
[1:14:36] iniquity, came to the world speaking
[1:14:38] lies. He had the same life that we all
[1:14:41] did.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; But it was just a little bit different,
[1:14:45] wasn't it?
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; When he was born, the pillar of fire
[1:14:48] came over his crib.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; Followed him as a child. When he was
[1:14:53] about six or seven years old, remember
[1:14:54] he was carrying cedar buckets on the way
[1:14:56] to his father's moonshine. Still God
[1:14:59] don't care.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; He's after his elected. That's
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; He could have been carrying him to
[1:15:06] church if he wanted if if that was God's
[1:15:07] plan. But it was a moonshine still
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; and a whirlwind came down in a tree and
[1:15:15] began to talk to him and say, "Don't
[1:15:17] ever smoke. Don't ever drink. Don't
[1:15:19] defile your body in any way because when
[1:15:20] you get older, there's a work for you to
[1:15:22] do." And as a six-year-old boy, that's
[1:15:24] about Wesley's age. He took off running
[1:15:25] to the house and he was scared. He
[1:15:27] thought a man was in that tree.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; Well, there it was.
[1:15:32] So later in life, he becomes a
[1:15:34] Christian. But the visions that he has
[1:15:36] in life never go away and they're always
[1:15:39] accurate.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; Things that, you know, God was teaching
[1:15:43] him from a young age that he would be
[1:15:45] living and where he would be living and
[1:15:46] all these different things. And and you
[1:15:47] can go listen to how the angel came to
[1:15:49] me and his life story and get every
[1:15:51] beautiful detail.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; But all the preachers that were around
[1:15:55] him that he respected constantly in his
[1:15:57] life told him it was the devil and to
[1:15:59] stay away from it.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; Right? And that really tore him up.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; That tore him up so bad that he finally
[1:16:04] said he had enough. He went in a cabin
[1:16:06] in the woods and he said, "I'll never
[1:16:07] come out until God takes this away from
[1:16:10] me."
[1:16:12] Because he said, "I don't want to be a
[1:16:13] devil." He said, "I love God."
[1:16:17] But the people that he respected told,
[1:16:18] "Billy, you stay away from that."
[1:16:21] But yet when he would come around
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; other palm readers and stuff, the devils
[1:16:25] recognized
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; the gift in his life.
[1:16:30] So, he's in that cabin and he's praying
[1:16:32] all night and asking God, think of this.
[1:16:37] He's in that cabin as a minister, as a
[1:16:39] Baptist minister, and he's asking God,
[1:16:41] he said, "God, please, whatever this is,
[1:16:44] I keep seeing these visions and
[1:16:46] whatever, when I feel it come on me, I
[1:16:47] can't help it, but whatever it is,
[1:16:49] please take it away from me." And he's
[1:16:52] begging and pleading with God to take
[1:16:54] this thing away from him. the very gift
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; that God put in his life. He's begging
[1:17:00] God to take it away from him.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; And all of a sudden, the light comes.
[1:17:08] And at first, he's in a dark cabin. He's
[1:17:10] in the woods, tucked away. There's no
[1:17:12] way that could be a flashlight or
[1:17:13] anything. And in that light, out of that
[1:17:15] light, steps an angel. That's right.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; And this angel, when God sends an angel,
[1:17:25] he's got a purpose.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; When he sent the angel to Mary, he had a
[1:17:30] purpose. And I'm going to read the quote
[1:17:33] because he says he was there and he says
[1:17:35] it best. He said, ' And he looked at me
[1:17:37] and he said,"Do not fear,
[1:17:40] for I am sent from the presence of
[1:17:42] Almighty God said to tell you that your
[1:17:46] peculiar birth
[1:17:48] and life has been to indicate that
[1:17:51] you're to take a gift of divine healing
[1:17:53] to the peoples of the world." Now
[1:17:55] listen, if you'll be sincere when you
[1:17:58] pray and get the people to believe you,
[1:18:03] when people would come in the prayer
[1:18:05] line, what would be one of the first
[1:18:06] things that he would say? Do you believe
[1:18:08] me?
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that what I've said is
[1:18:13] the truth?
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; Because if that person did not believe,
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; they couldn't be helped.
[1:18:27] The same applies today.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; Not just for not just for divine
[1:18:31] healing, anything from God. It's all
[1:18:34] based on faith.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; But he but the angel tells him, "Get the
[1:18:39] people to believe you and nothing
[1:18:44] shall stand before your prayer,
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; Not even cancer."
[1:18:52] The angel specifically in this cancer
[1:18:55] age mentioned not even cancer.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; So if you believe now God took his
[1:19:05] servant home
[1:19:07] but the angel is still here.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; The message is still here. It's just as
[1:19:12] right as the day it was spoken. So your
[1:19:15] faith in the same message will bring
[1:19:17] about the same result. That's right.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; And Sister Wanda, not even cancer.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, not even cancer.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; We'll be able to stand
[1:19:39] before our prayers.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; And what what do we have? The prophet
[1:19:44] begins to make excuses about his
[1:19:45] inability. And the angel took him
[1:19:47] through all the scriptures,
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; Did not our Lord, did not Moses.
[1:19:55] Then the angel tells him, if you'll be
[1:19:57] sincere,
[1:20:00] then it will come to pass that you will
[1:20:02] tell the people the very secrets of
[1:20:05] their hearts. Right.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; In June of 1933,
[1:20:14] he was preaching a revival and he goes
[1:20:16] and it's hot and he goes and he starts
[1:20:18] baptizing the Ohio River and he's
[1:20:20] baptizing all all all the the the
[1:20:22] trophies,
[1:20:24] the spiritual trophies of the service.
[1:20:26] And as he was baptizing the 17th person,
[1:20:29] that same pillar of fire came down and
[1:20:30] started churning the water.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:34] And in front of all them witnesses, a
[1:20:35] voice came out and it said, "As John the
[1:20:37] Baptist was sent to forrun the first
[1:20:39] coming of Christ, your message will
[1:20:41] forrun the second coming."
[1:20:44] Where was John the Baptist at whenever
[1:20:46] Jesus came to him? The river
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; baptizing.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; Where was the brother Brandham in the
[1:20:54] same spirit of Elijah at
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; when the pillar of fire, the same pillar
[1:20:59] of fire? That's right.
[1:21:03] that was incarnated in our Lord Jesus
[1:21:08] came down and vindicated the second
[1:21:11] forerunner.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; If Jesus had a forerunner before his
[1:21:14] first coming and the keystone of the
[1:21:16] Bible is that he doesn't change, then
[1:21:18] he's got to have a forerunner for his
[1:21:19] second coming.
[1:21:22] Now, as his ministry grew, so did the
[1:21:25] impersonators and the critics.
[1:21:29] But and you know in January of 1950
[1:21:33] he was not in a message church there.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; There were people there was a mixed
[1:21:38] audience and he was surrounded on that
[1:21:40] platform by critics.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; And God came down. He didn't God didn't
[1:21:45] have to do that.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; If God didn't do that, that wouldn't
[1:21:50] have changed his message whatsoever.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; But why did he do that? So that the
[1:21:54] world so on the day of judgment, the
[1:21:56] world will be without excuse.
[1:21:59] You even had a picture of it
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; without excuse.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; That's why he did it.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; Now Jesus called John more than a
[1:22:11] prophet. Why? Because he bridged the way
[1:22:14] between law and grace.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; This message,
[1:22:20] Brother Brandham was more than just a
[1:22:21] prophet. I'm not making him God,
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; but he was a prophet messenger. That's
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; right. because he was bridging the way
[1:22:28] between the church ages and the coming
[1:22:30] of the Lord. That's right.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; With a message to turn our hearts back.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; Now, God has an elected seed on the
[1:22:39] earth. That's
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; Remember when God created in the book of
[1:22:42] Genesis, he created everything. The
[1:22:44] seeds were already in the earth. And
[1:22:46] then whenever he moved the waters out of
[1:22:48] the way and he he said, "Let there be
[1:22:49] light." And the sun begin, brother Noah,
[1:22:52] the sun begin to shine on the earth. it.
[1:22:54] All it did was quicken the seeds that
[1:22:56] were already there.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; And that's all the elect are from every
[1:23:00] age. Whenever the word and the truth of
[1:23:03] every church age came down in the
[1:23:05] respective messenger and the messenger
[1:23:07] was preaching the word, all it did was
[1:23:08] shine light into the hearts of the
[1:23:10] elected seed. It brought them to light.
[1:23:12] It brought them to light. And there
[1:23:13] could be a seed sitting right there but
[1:23:15] a rock right next door.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; And the very next seed could be a rock.
[1:23:19] One springs up and sees it and the other
[1:23:20] one don't see anything.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; Why? because one has the seed.
[1:23:27] Now, the elect come from every
[1:23:29] background. Like I was saying about
[1:23:30] brother Ram carrying the the water to a
[1:23:32] moonshine still,
[1:23:36] every background,
[1:23:38] every walk of life, every history you
[1:23:41] can imagine.
[1:23:43] So God has got to catch the attention of
[1:23:45] his elected seed called the bride. She's
[1:23:48] in denominational churches. She's in the
[1:23:50] world
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; everywhere.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; How is God gonna do it?
[1:23:58] He's going to go fishing.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; He's going to go fishing. When Jesus was
[1:24:05] on the earth,
[1:24:07] his ministry had three pools.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; Noah's ministry had three pools.
[1:24:15] And this end time ministry had three
[1:24:18] pools. has three pools.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; Now, let me let me just inject this in
[1:24:23] here real fast. Never be intimidated by
[1:24:27] anything in this message,
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; Okay. A as a believer, no, we're all
[1:24:34] constantly trusting the Lord. We're all
[1:24:35] constantly learning. There's no such
[1:24:37] thing as a dumb question. If you ever
[1:24:39] have any questions, you you come
[1:24:41] approach us. That's
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; right. Amen.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; You ask one of the deacons. You
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; We're all a church family here. That's
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; right. Amen.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; And we're all in different levels of
[1:24:51] growth. That's
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; And I pray that God will even interpret
[1:24:54] even this sermon to the level that even
[1:24:56] the children can understand.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; It's it's it's very very simple. And if
[1:25:02] you don't understand something, you just
[1:25:03] put on the shelf and say, "Lord, you
[1:25:04] help me understand that in your time."
[1:25:05] But whatever God gives you to
[1:25:07] understand, let me tell you, hold on to
[1:25:08] that.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; And then the next time in service, you
[1:25:12] get something else out of that service.
[1:25:13] Then you hold on to that. Thank you,
[1:25:14] Lord. Don't be intimidated by all that
[1:25:16] you don't understand. and appreciate
[1:25:19] what you do understand.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; Appreciate what God has given you
[1:25:23] because that then belongs to you,
[1:25:25] brother Dylan.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; What God has given you to understand,
[1:25:29] hold it close
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; because that's God whispering his love
[1:25:32] secrets to you.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; So the three pools are are very simple.
[1:25:38] It's interesting because in Luke 17 26,
[1:25:41] Jesus is standing there and he says, "As
[1:25:44] it was in the days of Noah, so shall it
[1:25:47] also be in the days of the coming of the
[1:25:48] son of man." So you had Jesus himself
[1:25:51] sitting there with three pools in his
[1:25:52] ministry. Referring back to Noah's
[1:25:55] ministry that had three pools and to
[1:25:58] this last day ministry that was going to
[1:26:00] have three pools.
[1:26:05] So there, like I said, Jesus, he he was
[1:26:07] going to go fishing. Jesus likened many
[1:26:10] of his parables to fishing.
[1:26:13] He'd he'd start one of his parables by
[1:26:15] saying, "The kingdom of God is like a
[1:26:17] man casting his net."
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; When he called Peter, Andrew, and James,
[1:26:21] and John, what were they doing?
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; Mending their nets. And what did he tell
[1:26:26] him? He said, "Follow me, and I'll make
[1:26:28] you fishers of men."
[1:26:32] So all these all these years and years
[1:26:35] and years later, his seventh church age
[1:26:38] messenger loves to fish.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; So when the angel one day gives him a
[1:26:45] vision,
[1:26:47] he gives him a vision
[1:26:49] about fishing.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; But the fishing isn't just to make him a
[1:26:55] better fisherman naturally. The purpose
[1:26:57] of the vision is because brother
[1:26:59] Brandham could relate to the fishing and
[1:27:01] it was to to symbolize three pools of
[1:27:04] his ministry.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; When you fish, brother Jerry, you pull,
[1:27:08] right? So each one has got a reason. You
[1:27:11] work the lure,
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; Or so I'm told. I'm not a good
[1:27:15] fisherman.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; Every time I work the lure, I get hung
[1:27:19] up.
[1:27:22] But the and the angel of the Lord come
[1:27:23] comes to brother Brandham here. And I'm
[1:27:25] going to read it because I I want it
[1:27:27] verbatim so that you'll understand and
[1:27:28] catch it. So, Brother is describing the
[1:27:31] vision. The angel of the Lord has given
[1:27:32] him this vision. He said, "I was
[1:27:33] standing there by a side of a beautiful
[1:27:35] lake, something like your lake out here
[1:27:37] in the summertime wherein it's real
[1:27:39] pretty and green, and there were
[1:27:40] fishermen all around the lake and they
[1:27:41] were fishing." Now, remember that quote
[1:27:43] I read to you about change in the hand
[1:27:45] of God.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; He said there were fishermen all around
[1:27:49] the lake and they were all fishing, but
[1:27:50] they were catching small fish.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. God has a purpose for that.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; And I looked out on the lake and those
[1:28:01] great big those great beautiful rainbow
[1:28:04] trout out there and I said, I know this
[1:28:06] is a vision. I can't understand those
[1:28:07] trout, but I said, you know, I believe
[1:28:09] right down in my heart I can catch
[1:28:11] those. So I picked up the string, but
[1:28:14] instead of it being a string, it was a
[1:28:16] fishing pole.
[1:28:18] Just and just then the one behind me
[1:28:20] said, "Now I'll teach you how to fish
[1:28:22] and how to catch those." This is where
[1:28:25] the angel is explaining brother
[1:28:26] Brandham's three pools in his ministry.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; And so he took and he said, "Tie the
[1:28:34] lure." And I snapped the lure on. He
[1:28:35] said, "Now throw it way out." Listen
[1:28:37] now. Listen close. Way out into the
[1:28:40] deep. And he said, "Now when you do, let
[1:28:42] the lure sink down first. Then said,
[1:28:45] pull it slow." Now, that's really a
[1:28:47] fisherman's technique. He said, 'Now,
[1:28:48] when you do, now you'll feel some
[1:28:50] nibbles at it, but don't tell nobody
[1:28:52] what you're doing. Keep it to yourself.
[1:28:56] And then when you feel the nibble again,
[1:28:57] he said, "Pull it just a little bit. A
[1:28:59] little bit. Not too hard." He said,
[1:29:01] "Then pull it. It'll pull away from the
[1:29:04] little fish.
[1:29:06] And when they scatter,
[1:29:11] that'll attract the tension of the big
[1:29:14] fish."
[1:29:16] and they'll grab it.
[1:29:19] Except you eat the flesh of the son of
[1:29:21] man
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; and drink his blood, you have no part in
[1:29:27] me.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; What did the little fish do?
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; Gone.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; What did the rainbow trout do?
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; He said that's the way you'll catch it.
[1:29:43] said, "When they bite on the third time,
[1:29:45] set your hook for the catch."
[1:29:50] So, he had three pulls.
[1:29:53] Brother Matt, I'm I need you.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; I'm going to use him to demonstrate if
[1:30:00] you'll just come with me on this side,
[1:30:01] brother. So, when Brother Brand would
[1:30:02] operate his prayer lines in the in in in
[1:30:04] the first pull, he always had people
[1:30:07] come this way. If you notice, even on
[1:30:09] the sermons of Deep Call to the Deep in
[1:30:10] the Chicago campaign, it was always this
[1:30:12] way. He said because the angel of the
[1:30:13] Lord always stood on his right side.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; So he wanted the angel of the Lord
[1:30:17] between him and the patient.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; So the angel told him when he operated
[1:30:22] the first pull, he said you take your
[1:30:25] left hand and you hold the patient's
[1:30:27] right hand.
[1:30:29] And he said when you do you he would
[1:30:31] break out like in a rash and in bumps
[1:30:34] and he would be able to touch and he'd
[1:30:36] be able to discern what was going on
[1:30:38] with that person. But he had to
[1:30:40] physically the the patient had to
[1:30:42] physically be here and physically grab a
[1:30:44] hold of his hand and whenever if the
[1:30:46] bumps would disappear then he can say
[1:30:47] God bless you you're healed.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; That was the first pull. What did that
[1:30:50] contact the flesh?
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; But remember the prophet said if you'll
[1:30:55] be sincere there's going to come. The
[1:30:56] angel told him if you'll be sincere
[1:30:58] there's going to come a time where
[1:30:59] you'll know the very secret of their
[1:31:01] hearts.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; So then it be to transition into the
[1:31:04] second pull. So when the second pull and
[1:31:07] the patient would come up, he'd just sit
[1:31:08] there and he would look and he'd begin
[1:31:10] to see all of a sudden like if it was
[1:31:12] brother Matt, he'd go away and he'd see
[1:31:13] him as a little child or see him what
[1:31:15] was going on.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; And he would then begin to discern what
[1:31:18] was in his life,
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; And that was the second pull. And the
[1:31:22] pillar of fire would sometimes leave
[1:31:24] here and and say, "Brother Ram, just
[1:31:25] pray for somebody." And they left and
[1:31:26] another patient came up, but then the
[1:31:28] pillar of fire would go over there
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; and he'd have to follow that pillar of
[1:31:32] fire constantly. That's right.
[1:31:35] What would he say? He said, "If I can,
[1:31:37] let me just talk to you a little bit. If
[1:31:39] I can contact your spirit." That's
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; The first pull was on the level of the
[1:31:45] flesh.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; The second pull was on the level of the
[1:31:49] spirit, the human spirit.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; But the third pull is on the level of
[1:31:55] the soul.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Matt.
[1:31:59] Is on the level of the soul.
[1:32:02] Amen.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; You can't come and have brother Ram
[1:32:06] discern your problem.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; But that third pool ministry is still in
[1:32:11] effect.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; That's why you're here
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; is because you're that rainbow trout.
[1:32:17] And when everyone else was scattering
[1:32:19] 1977 came, think of how many of that
[1:32:20] scattered
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; instead. And see, God uses the the gifts
[1:32:26] of the ministry and the healing and
[1:32:28] things to catch the fish's attention, to
[1:32:30] catch the attention of the rainbow
[1:32:32] trout.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; But God just didn't send he he the the
[1:32:35] people benefited from the divine
[1:32:37] healing. But the whole purpose was to
[1:32:39] forerun the second coming of the Lord.
[1:32:42] That's
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; 60 years later, the prophet's gone.
[1:32:46] People still love the gift. They can't
[1:32:49] deny the gift.
[1:32:51] But when it comes to that third pull,
[1:32:53] they scatter
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; because it's only for the bride. What
[1:32:58] where was Jesus in the book of
[1:32:59] Revelation at the end of the Leoian
[1:33:02] church age? Where was Jesus at the end
[1:33:03] of the church age? Outside
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; knocking trying to get back into his own
[1:33:09] church.
[1:33:12] So if you want to be with Jesus, you
[1:33:14] have to be where he is.
[1:33:18] Jesus, God comes
[1:33:21] in three sons names.
[1:33:24] Son of man, son of God, and son of
[1:33:28] David. It's the same God. All it is is
[1:33:31] this dispensational. You say, "What is a
[1:33:32] dispensation?" It is just an amount of
[1:33:34] time that God allows or allotss to deal
[1:33:37] with a group of people like the Gentiles
[1:33:40] and the Jews.
[1:33:43] So when he came as son of man the first
[1:33:45] time he was in flesh a prophet. Son of
[1:33:48] man means a prophet.
[1:33:52] Then whenever he was crucified and he
[1:33:54] resurrected and went up to heaven he
[1:33:55] sent the holy ghost. He became he is
[1:33:57] still the same god but he now got into
[1:33:59] the son of god
[1:34:01] office the spirit the holy ghost. And
[1:34:05] when he's going to rule and reign on the
[1:34:07] earth he's literally going to be king of
[1:34:08] the earth.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's literally going to be sitting
[1:34:12] on a throne.
[1:34:15] So you have son of man, son of God, son
[1:34:18] of David.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; But he made a very special promise to us
[1:34:25] in between son of God and son of David.
[1:34:29] He promises that the son of man will be
[1:34:31] revealed again. That's
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; Son of God, son of man, the first
[1:34:37] coming. Son of God during the church age
[1:34:39] is the Holy Ghost.
[1:34:41] Son of David is the future, the
[1:34:43] millennium when he's going to rule and
[1:34:45] reign with the bride. That's when you
[1:34:48] can go and pet a lion. Don't do it now.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; But in between the son of God and son of
[1:34:56] David,
[1:34:58] that's where you find Luke 17:30.
[1:35:01] Even thus shall it be in the day when
[1:35:04] the son of man is revealed. That's what
[1:35:07] this message is. It's the son of man
[1:35:09] ministry.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; It is God building in a prophet to turn
[1:35:15] our hearts back.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; Remember when Jesus was here and he saw
[1:35:21] Nathaniel coming and he all of a sudden
[1:35:23] he said, "Behold an Israelite indeed in
[1:35:26] whom is no G." How did he know who
[1:35:28] Nathaniel was? He never met him before.
[1:35:32] But he was the Messiah and that was the
[1:35:34] sign of the Messiah.
[1:35:37] And and when Jesus answered and said,
[1:35:38] "Before that, Philip called you when you
[1:35:40] were under the fig tree, I saw you."
[1:35:43] So if he did that then in that son of
[1:35:46] man ministry, then he's going to do it
[1:35:48] again in this son of man ministry.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; It's the same works. Amen.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; So Nathaniel answered in in 1 John 1:49,
[1:35:58] John 1:49, Nathaniel answered and said
[1:36:01] unto him, "Rabbi, thou art the son of
[1:36:03] God, the king of Israel."
[1:36:06] In other words, Jesus is getting ready
[1:36:08] to say here. He said, "If you think the
[1:36:09] second pool is something," he said,
[1:36:11] "Because I said unto thee, I saw thee
[1:36:12] under the fig tree, believest thou, thou
[1:36:14] shalt see greater things than this.
[1:36:17] Verily, verily, I say unto you,
[1:36:20] hereafter shall ye see the heaven open
[1:36:22] and the angels of God ascending and
[1:36:24] descending on the son of man.
[1:36:28] So if Jesus had three pools and they
[1:36:30] reacted to his three pools the same way,
[1:36:33] then how are they going to react today?
[1:36:38] Remember God doesn't change. His
[1:36:41] ministry doesn't change. Flesh flesh
[1:36:43] will pass away but the spirit doesn't.
[1:36:46] If they crucified him when he came the
[1:36:48] first time as son of man, what are they
[1:36:50] going to do again to the word when he
[1:36:51] comes the second time as son of man?
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; They're going to crucify him.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; Because he's Hebrews 13:8.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; So to come to make full circle
[1:37:03] what is the message?
[1:37:08] It's not just brother Brandham.
[1:37:12] He was the messenger, but he brought
[1:37:15] something.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; Or let me get it real personal. He
[1:37:20] introduced someone.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; There it is.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; That's the message.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; What is the message? I'm looking at it.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; The message is not I don't have a book
[1:37:34] up here, but the message is not books
[1:37:35] and tapes. They're tools to get the word
[1:37:38] in you.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. You could eat the literal pages of
[1:37:43] the Bible. I wouldn't recommend it. But
[1:37:44] that would not put the word in you.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; That would not put the word in you. But
[1:37:50] you sit here under the anointing of the
[1:37:51] Holy Ghost and let the preaching come
[1:37:53] forth and you receive it in faith.
[1:37:55] That'll put the word for you. That'll
[1:37:57] put the word in you. That's what
[1:37:58] happened on the day of Pentecost while
[1:38:00] Peter yet spake the words. That's how
[1:38:02] they get got the Holy Ghost.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; Now, we believe in Jesus name baptism.
[1:38:06] But let me say, don't stop there.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; That's right. Come on.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; Don't stop here. Brother Brandon was
[1:38:12] saying in the church age book, he said
[1:38:13] multitudes fail right there. It's the
[1:38:16] right baptism. Yes, in the name of Jesus
[1:38:18] Christ. But go on to receive the Holy
[1:38:20] Ghost.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; Go on. If you've been baptized, begin to
[1:38:24] ask him for the Holy Ghost. Begin to ask
[1:38:26] him, "Lord, I need the Holy Ghost. I
[1:38:28] need the Holy Ghost. Sanctify me.
[1:38:29] Sanctify me. I need the Holy Ghost." And
[1:38:31] guess what? He promised he'll give it to
[1:38:33] you.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; Why? because you are obedient to be
[1:38:37] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:38:39] Christ.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; He would, you know, as the prophet's
[1:38:46] ministry came on, he began to be more
[1:38:48] forthcoming
[1:38:50] and early on he was in the first and
[1:38:52] second pole and and he was just trying
[1:38:54] to he was using the wisdom of God
[1:38:55] because he was trying to get people in
[1:38:57] because you know God would send him to a
[1:38:59] city for one person.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; Do you know God would have a church
[1:39:02] service for one person? That's right.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; Do you know God will operate an entire
[1:39:05] camp to get to one person? That's
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; If he has to.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; That's how God does.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; All the resources that went into the
[1:39:14] brand meetings. And he might have only
[1:39:16] went there for one person,
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; one rainbow trout.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; But he says, "My mission, I believe, to
[1:39:24] the earth is what? To forrun the coming
[1:39:26] word." See the coming word which is
[1:39:28] Christ and Christ in him has the
[1:39:30] millennium and has everything right
[1:39:31] there because he is the word. See? All
[1:39:35] right. Now, the Bible is a love letter.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; And you read a love letter, which now is
[1:39:43] probably a love text. I don't know.
[1:39:46] But you read it between the lines.
[1:39:49] Whenever you're really in love with
[1:39:50] somebody and they send you that and she
[1:39:52] or he sends you that really special
[1:39:54] text, you can you can you can get the
[1:39:56] vibe behind the text.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; And this Bible was God's love letter to
[1:40:01] us.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; And we read between the lines.
[1:40:06] In Genesis 18, God came down in flesh
[1:40:09] and performed this same ministry
[1:40:14] to Abraham and Sarah.
[1:40:16] And there at the end, the prophet would
[1:40:18] be so would just tell him out in the
[1:40:20] open and he would literally turn his
[1:40:21] back. He'd preach about Abraham and
[1:40:23] Sarah, then turn his back,
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; And begin to the Holy Ghost would begin
[1:40:28] to discern,
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; And what did Jesus What did Jesus tell
[1:40:32] them in St. John 8:56? He told the
[1:40:34] Pharisees, he said, "Your father Abraham
[1:40:37] rejoiceed to see my day, and he saw it
[1:40:40] and was glad."
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; How did Abraham see his day? The same
[1:40:44] sign. That's
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:40:46] Because Jesus came all them hundreds or
[1:40:49] or hundreds and hundreds of years later
[1:40:51] in flesh and did the same sign that
[1:40:54] Melzdc did for Abraham.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; It was the same God.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; But Melzdc couldn't die for our sins.
[1:41:05] He spoke the word. He stepped into that
[1:41:06] body and then he was gone.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; But Jesus became born of a woman,
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:41:12] so he could experience what everyone
[1:41:15] experiences.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; He wanted a full human experience.
[1:41:20] And Jesus aged
[1:41:24] because he wanted to fill it all.
[1:41:29] So after he after he discerned the
[1:41:31] thoughts of Sarah, their body was
[1:41:32] changed.
[1:41:35] He Abraham was never in Sodom.
[1:41:39] Right.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; But remember, there were two messengers
[1:41:42] that went and preached to Sodom.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram would identify them as Billy
[1:41:47] Graham and Oral Roberts.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; Good, decent men. They were anointed of
[1:41:52] God to do what they did.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; Because remember, you have the pennies,
[1:41:59] the dimes, and they had their place,
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; But God stayed back with Abraham.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; He stayed back with his silver dollar.
[1:42:08] And he not only stayed back with him, he
[1:42:10] made he said, "Shall I hide from Abraham
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; the things that I'm about to do?"
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; Seeing that he's become of heir. He's
[1:42:21] he's become an heir of all the earth.
[1:42:23] Shall I hide from Abraham?
[1:42:27] He hasn't hid nothing from Abraham's
[1:42:29] seed.
[1:42:33] Sodom is doing what Sodom is doing, but
[1:42:36] the bride's doing what the bride's
[1:42:37] doing.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; Rebecca and Isaac in Genesis 24. See,
[1:42:44] the Bible and they have stories. They're
[1:42:45] not just stories. There's a lot of
[1:42:47] things that happen in these people's
[1:42:48] lives that is not recorded in the
[1:42:49] scripture. But what is recorded in the
[1:42:51] scripture, we have to pay very close
[1:42:52] attention to.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; There is a reason for every story in the
[1:42:56] Bible. Even the ones you can't explain,
[1:42:59] we can't wrap our minds around. There's
[1:43:00] a reason for it.
[1:43:02] So, we find that after that Isaac, as he
[1:43:04] becomes of age, Abraham realizes that
[1:43:07] it's time that he get married.
[1:43:10] So, he's got a very faithful servant
[1:43:12] named Eleazar.
[1:43:15] And that's a picture of this end time.
[1:43:18] Abraham, a type of God. You have Isaac,
[1:43:21] a type of Jesus Christ. And Eleazar, a
[1:43:23] type of brother Brandham.
[1:43:26] Now, whenever God whenever, excuse me,
[1:43:28] whenever Abraham sent Eleazar to go get
[1:43:30] Isaac a wife, he said, "Don't go to
[1:43:32] Babylon where I came out of." He said,
[1:43:35] "You go to my kindred."
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; You go to my type of people.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; And that's where you get Isaac.
[1:43:45] The name Eleazar,
[1:43:47] this is this was pretty fascinating to
[1:43:49] me. The name Eleazar, Eli, like in
[1:43:53] Elijah. Elijah means God
[1:43:56] is Jehovah.
[1:43:58] Jehovah, the the God is my Jehovah.
[1:44:02] And Elazar means God
[1:44:05] is my help.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; Elijah is my God is Jehovah.
[1:44:13] And Eleazar means God is my help. In
[1:44:16] other words, he's helpless without him.
[1:44:19] That's right.
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; When he would begin to to discern what
[1:44:22] he would stall and he'd start building
[1:44:23] the people's faith with the woman at the
[1:44:25] well with the story of Nathaniel, he
[1:44:26] said, "You know what I'm doing?
[1:44:29] I'm waiting on him
[1:44:31] cuz I can't do nothing without him."
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; Now, eer, the second part of Elizer
[1:44:39] means help. And it's actually the same
[1:44:42] word that's used to describe Eve
[1:44:46] whenever she was taken from Adam as a
[1:44:49] help meat for Adam.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; It's the same word.
[1:44:55] And the in Genesis 2:18, and the Lord
[1:44:57] God said, "It is not good that man
[1:44:58] should dwell alone. I will make and help
[1:45:01] me meet for him." It literally means a
[1:45:03] help that's corresponding to him, a help
[1:45:06] that's suitable for him. That's
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:45:10] Amen.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; Before the fall, Eve was co-equal with
[1:45:14] Adam.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; Where God sends a prophet as a type of
[1:45:18] Elazar to take a bride for Isaac
[1:45:22] whose help is God
[1:45:25] to call out a bride taken from the side
[1:45:28] of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; Because where was Eve taken from Adam's
[1:45:34] side?
[1:45:35] Where's the bride taken from? the side
[1:45:38] of the Lord Jesus. Remember when he was
[1:45:39] on the cross?
[1:45:42] We're joint hes with Christ.
[1:45:45] As Rebecca's coming back,
[1:45:48] where does she meet her Isaac? In the
[1:45:50] field between his house and between her
[1:45:53] house. We meet the Lord Jesus in the air
[1:45:57] between his home and where we just came
[1:45:59] from.
[1:46:02] The
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; the these stories, brothers and sisters,
[1:46:04] are endless of the different types and
[1:46:06] shadows of the message.
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; The whole Bible speaks of this hour.
[1:46:12] Speaks of of Jesus Christ and the bride
[1:46:14] because the whole Bible is a love story.
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; So you have Abraham and his experiences.
[1:46:19] Then you have Isaac and his experiences.
[1:46:21] Then you have Jacob and Rachel.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; And we know how much he loved Rachel.
[1:46:27] How many years did he have to work for
[1:46:29] Rachel? He worked seven and he got
[1:46:32] tricked and he got Leah
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; like the Old Testament bride and he had
[1:46:37] to work a whole another seven church I
[1:46:39] mean years
[1:46:41] amen
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; to get Rachel
[1:46:44] right
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; in 2 Kings 8 there was a widow woman who
[1:46:47] had to leave the land of her fathers the
[1:46:49] promised land because of famine in the
[1:46:51] land
[1:46:52] for seven years or seven church ages
[1:46:55] there was a famine at the end of the
[1:46:56] seven years she comes back and the king
[1:46:59] appoints
[1:47:00] The king appoints a certain officer to
[1:47:05] restore everything that she lost.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; Everything she was missing during the
[1:47:09] seven church ages
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; gets restored back to her.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; The message is the midnight cry of
[1:47:18] Matthew 25.
[1:47:21] At midnight there was a cry made,
[1:47:23] "Behold, the bridegroom cometh. Go ye
[1:47:25] out to meet him."
[1:47:29] The message is a voice that came from
[1:47:30] heaven that said, "Come out of her, my
[1:47:32] people, and be ye not a partaker of her
[1:47:34] sins, that you receive not of her
[1:47:36] plagues." What is that? The voice of
[1:47:38] Jesus Christ. It's the voice behind the
[1:47:40] voice.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; In the present stage of my ministry,
[1:47:46] Brother Ran realizes that he's began to
[1:47:48] be forsaken.
[1:47:50] the doors of his ministry that the doors
[1:47:52] are getting smaller and few between as
[1:47:54] it if you'll understand the figure of
[1:47:56] speech getting less and less invitations
[1:47:58] to preach. People rejecting the gospel
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; and he realized he takes just like he he
[1:48:04] took a sermon of I was not disobedient
[1:48:06] to the heavenly vision
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; and he began to preach it and all them
[1:48:10] preachers got up and walked out on them.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; He realized he was like Paul.
[1:48:17] Paul, every messenger is going to be
[1:48:20] represented with the elect of their age.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; Paul is going to appear with his group.
[1:48:25] Remember when brother went past the
[1:48:27] curtain of time, right?
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, he's the messenger of
[1:48:31] our church age,
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; So we he's going to present us to the
[1:48:35] Lord Jesus as the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; We'll always be we'll always be
[1:48:40] associated together.
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful?
[1:48:47] We'll always be associated together
[1:48:49] throughout all eternity because of our
[1:48:50] journey here on earth. We'll always be
[1:48:52] associated with the prophet because we
[1:48:54] believed his ministry.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; Think about when when you meet him
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; and all that he preached all them years
[1:49:05] ago and yet you stood firm in the worst
[1:49:09] of times
[1:49:10] and you believed.
[1:49:14] How's that going to make you? You talk
[1:49:15] about some tears flowing.
[1:49:20] That is why when the resurrection
[1:49:22] happens on the earth, the prophet said
[1:49:23] that we're all going to be able to see
[1:49:24] who's there, get to hug one another, and
[1:49:28] then when we all go up, it'll be all
[1:49:30] eyes on him.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; Sure, we're going to see brother
[1:49:35] Brandham. Sure, the like I said, tears
[1:49:37] will be shed, but then we're all going
[1:49:38] to start looking at him.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; What a time that's going to be.
[1:49:45] Why? Because you cared enough about his
[1:49:48] word. He sent you a message and you
[1:49:51] believed it.
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; He said, "I hope he will crown my
[1:49:56] ministry of this of letting me take the
[1:49:59] clothes of the word and dress his bride
[1:50:01] in the clothe of the word and and for
[1:50:04] his righteousness. I hope he will crown
[1:50:07] me. Let me stand on that day. Say,
[1:50:09] behold the lamb of God that takes away
[1:50:11] the sin of the world.
[1:50:14] the same spirit of Elijah. Now when John
[1:50:18] introduced when John the Baptist
[1:50:19] introduced Jesus,
[1:50:21] the focus then transitioned from John
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; right
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; to Jesus.
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham introduces Jesus Christ
[1:50:32] to us. He'll never lose. He's a seventh
[1:50:37] star.
[1:50:40] But the emphasis, the focus and the
[1:50:43] adoration
[1:50:45] is on the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; Remember John even said, "He that hath
[1:50:51] the bride is the bridegroom.
[1:50:53] But the friend of the bridegroom which
[1:50:56] standeth and heareth rejoices greatly of
[1:50:58] the bridegroom's voice. This is my joy
[1:51:00] therefore is fulfilled. He must
[1:51:02] increase, but I must decrease."
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; That's right. You can imagine what it
[1:51:07] must have been like if you knew if
[1:51:08] you're a personal friend of brother
[1:51:09] Brandham and have him taken away so
[1:51:11] tragically so quickly without warning.
[1:51:14] How helpless and lost. And what are we
[1:51:16] going to do? There was no message
[1:51:18] churches to go to. What are we going to
[1:51:20] do?
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; But God wanted the bride's attention to
[1:51:26] turn to what he said.
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; That's where he wants our attention.
[1:51:32] He wants our attention to be on he
[1:51:34] because he is the message in the in the
[1:51:37] rapture and I'm getting ready to close
[1:51:38] in the rapture sermon in the rapture
[1:51:41] scripture of first Thessalonians 4
[1:51:45] verse 13. But I would not have you be
[1:51:47] ignorant brethren concerning them which
[1:51:48] are asleep that ye sorrow not even as
[1:51:51] others which have no hope. For if we
[1:51:53] believe that Jesus died and rose again,
[1:51:55] even so them also which sleep in Jesus
[1:51:57] will God bring with him. For this we say
[1:52:00] unto you by the word of the Lord, that
[1:52:02] we which are alive and remain unto the
[1:52:03] coming of the Lord shall not prevent
[1:52:05] them which are asleep.
[1:52:07] For the Lord himself
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; shall descend from heaven with a shout.
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; There's your message.
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; Now, it didn't say William Brandon would
[1:52:21] descend with a shout.
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; It says that the Lord himself would
[1:52:25] descend from heaven with a shout.
[1:52:29] In Revelations 10, when he has the book
[1:52:31] open, he the mighty angel comes down.
[1:52:34] But the mighty angel descending, there's
[1:52:36] an seventh uh church age messenger, a
[1:52:39] star on the earth to receive the word.
[1:52:44] And who does it introduce? Jesus Christ.
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; See the third pull, number three can't
[1:52:52] come before one.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; Right? If number three, if the third
[1:52:55] pole and the opening of the word and the
[1:52:56] seventh seal was preached in 1947, that
[1:52:58] would have probably put all of our eyes
[1:53:00] out. The bright light,
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; But it is just a little bit of time.
[1:53:05] Catch their attention. Catch their
[1:53:08] attention. God's moving. The lame walk.
[1:53:11] The blind see. Bible days are here
[1:53:14] again.
[1:53:16] And then behind the sign, there was a
[1:53:18] voice.
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; The voice of the sign.
[1:53:22] So, if you're a part of the shout, then
[1:53:25] you're a part of the rapture.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; Think about it. The rapture, the the the
[1:53:31] body change that we're all waiting for,
[1:53:33] it's going to be it'll be in a moment, a
[1:53:34] twinkling of an eye that Paul talked
[1:53:36] about. But the actual rapture is a
[1:53:39] process.
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; And it's in motion.
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; And it has been for decades. So, if
[1:53:45] you're in the shout, Brother Chester,
[1:53:47] then you're also in the voice and the
[1:53:49] trump.
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; Now, how do we get into the shout? By
[1:53:53] attending FGLT or by attending Evening
[1:53:56] Light or a No, you get into him by one
[1:53:59] spirit. That's how you get into the
[1:54:01] shout. And once you're in the shout, you
[1:54:04] got the token, baby, you in.
[1:54:07] You going
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; cuz you have your token in your hand.
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; And how, like the prophet said, if you
[1:54:16] have the token, how can somebody make me
[1:54:17] get off the bus?
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; Come on. You don't just have like like
[1:54:22] like like a ticket like you when you go
[1:54:24] to Disney World. Sorry, Sister Whitney,
[1:54:25] but you just go to Disney World and you
[1:54:27] don't really have a spot. You got to try
[1:54:29] and find yourself a spot because there's
[1:54:30] only No, you've got a reservation
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; and nobody can take your spot.
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; If you're in the message,
[1:54:42] think about the words. Not are you in
[1:54:46] the message?
[1:54:49] That changes because the message has got
[1:54:51] to be in you.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; And I and my father, the father in me.
[1:54:57] So if you're a part of the shout, then
[1:54:59] you're a part of the entire rapture.
[1:55:03] Where would we be as individuals, our
[1:55:06] lives? If it wasn't for this message,
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; I don't I I can't even begin to think
[1:55:14] it's everything to us. It's not a
[1:55:15] doctrine. It's not a bunch of
[1:55:17] commandments. It's not legalism. is
[1:55:18] grace.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; Some people may look to see legalism to
[1:55:21] see rules and wish they could do
[1:55:23] something. But if their heart were
[1:55:24] changed and they would line themselves
[1:55:26] up with the word, they see jubilee. They
[1:55:28] see freedom.
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; Jubilee. The headstone.
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; Remember in the scriptures in Zechariah
[1:55:35] when the headstone,
[1:55:37] a type of this age came, what was it
[1:55:40] crying out? Grace. Grace.
[1:55:44] But in the book of Revelation,
[1:55:47] the angels, the judgment angels, whoo,
[1:55:50] whoo, woe to the inhabitants of the
[1:55:53] earth.
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; But to the bride, grace, grace, grace
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; to the world, it's the great tribulation
[1:56:01] is before them. Think we're so excited.
[1:56:03] We're on the cusp of the body change and
[1:56:05] we just can't wait. And we're so excited
[1:56:07] and the world is on the cusp of the
[1:56:09] great tribulation period,
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; right? and have no idea.
[1:56:14] &gt;&gt; Remember the scripture said whenever
[1:56:16] they say peace and safety, that's when
[1:56:18] sudden destruction is going to come on
[1:56:19] them.
[1:56:21] Brother Ram said in the sermon,
[1:56:24] who do you say this is? He says that's
[1:56:26] the way the message is. You can
[1:56:28] sympathize with it and say it's right,
[1:56:31] but you've got to take it yourself to
[1:56:34] become a part of it.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; Then you and the message become one.
[1:56:38] Then the anointing is with you as it was
[1:56:41] with the others.
[1:56:44] Now the Holy Ghost and the new birth is
[1:56:46] the same thing. The new birth is Jesus
[1:56:49] Christ personally revealed to you.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; You know for yourself
[1:56:59] that Jesus Christ rose from the dead
[1:57:01] because he revealed he literally you met
[1:57:03] him.
[1:57:05] Just like the evidence of the Holy Ghost
[1:57:07] is hearing the word for your day. It's
[1:57:10] personally revealed to you. There has to
[1:57:13] come a point, young people, where it's
[1:57:15] not it's right because mommy and daddy
[1:57:17] says it's right. That's
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; It's right because you know it's right.
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; Then no matter we pray, we all go
[1:57:26] together. But if something were to
[1:57:28] happen to mommy and daddy, I'm still
[1:57:29] believing this message.
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; That's when you've got something real.
[1:57:33] Because remember the admonition to every
[1:57:34] church age
[1:57:37] is he that has an ear to hear what the
[1:57:39] spirit says unto the church let him
[1:57:42] hear.
[1:57:46] Luke 17:30 isn't just about manifesting
[1:57:49] Jesus Christ just in the prophet. The
[1:57:52] extension of that is in the bride
[1:57:58] continuing the same works the same
[1:58:00] ministry. She is him.
[1:58:04] Let's stand. Musicians can come
[1:58:08] in the sermon trying to do a service
[1:58:10] without it being God's will. Brother Ram
[1:58:12] says, "How many of you ever seen that
[1:58:16] picture of a cow in a bush that you just
[1:58:19] have to look and look?" Did you ever see
[1:58:21] that? Or seen the picture of Christ in a
[1:58:22] bush or in the sky or the clouds? See,
[1:58:24] that painter has got it so fixed up to
[1:58:27] you have to look at it just a certain
[1:58:29] way.
[1:58:31] Well, then when you once see it, you
[1:58:33] can't see nothing else but that.
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; Every time you look, there it is. How
[1:58:38] many seen those pictures? Well, sure you
[1:58:40] have. He said, "That's the way it is."
[1:58:43] That well, that's the way Christ is
[1:58:45] himself, the gospel. The message is when
[1:58:48] you once see the message of the hour,
[1:58:53] there's nothing else you can see
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; but that.
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; That's all. Everything else is gone. The
[1:58:59] rest is just a filler. See, when you
[1:59:01] once see
[1:59:04] the message,
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; I pray that something was said tonight
[1:59:09] that you can take and and grab a hold
[1:59:11] of, maybe help your understanding some.
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:16] &gt;&gt; God has done something very special for
[1:59:18] us in this hour.
[1:59:21] &gt;&gt; And let me just also say this in
[1:59:23] closing. You might have never spoke in
[1:59:26] tongues or danced in the spirit in your
[1:59:28] life. Amen.
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; You might have never seen the pillar of
[1:59:31] fire. You might have never had a
[1:59:32] spiritual dream. You might have never
[1:59:34] seen a vision. You might have never seen
[1:59:35] the lame walk or the blind see. But the
[1:59:38] greatest thing, the greatest thing that
[1:59:41] God can ever do for you is to give you
[1:59:43] an ear to hear
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; what the spirit is saying in this day.
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; Because there's multitudes of people all
[1:59:51] across this world in churches that do
[1:59:54] all them things but would reject this
[1:59:56] truth.
[1:59:59] That is the most powerful
[2:00:02] and most amazing thing that God could
[2:00:04] ever do for you.
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; If you could play something softly,
[2:00:08] please.
[2:00:10] So, what is the message of the hour?
[2:00:13] The message of the hour is Jesus Christ.
[2:00:18] If you could speak to Noah and you say,
[2:00:20] "Noah, what is the message of the hour?"
[2:00:24] He said, "Get on the ark because it's
[2:00:26] going to rain."
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; Abraham, what is the message of the
[2:00:31] hour?
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's Melzdc. He took on flesh and I
[2:00:34] met him. He brought me out of Babylon.
[2:00:37] He came in flesh to vindicate the coming
[2:00:39] of the promised son.
[2:00:42] Moses,
[2:00:44] what is the message of the hour?
[2:00:47] &gt;&gt; Apply the token because the death
[2:00:49] angel's in the land and we're leaving in
[2:00:51] the morning.
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:00:54] Joshua,
[2:00:56] what is the message of the hour?
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; Get ready.
[2:01:02] For within three days you shall pass
[2:01:05] over this Jordan
[2:01:07] &gt;&gt; to go in to possess the land which the
[2:01:09] Lord your God giveth you.
[2:01:12] Mary,
[2:01:14] what is the message of the hour?
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; The baby that I received by the spoken
[2:01:19] word of an angel is the Messiah.
[2:01:24] that he shall be great and shall be
[2:01:26] called the son of the highest and the
[2:01:28] Lord God shall give unto him the throne
[2:01:31] of his father David.
[2:01:34] John the Baptist, what is the message of
[2:01:37] the hour? Behold the lamb of God that
[2:01:40] takes away the sin of the world.
[2:01:44] Omega bride,
[2:01:48] what is the message of the hour?
[2:01:53] Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today,
[2:01:55] and forever.
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; Let me quote the words of John for you.
[2:01:59] After he recognized Jesus after the
[2:02:01] resurrection,
[2:02:04] they were all so bummed out and they go
[2:02:07] fishing. They're trying to keep busy and
[2:02:08] they didn't see it coming. They didn't
[2:02:10] understand. Jesus kept telling them,
[2:02:11] "I'm about to go up to Jerusalem. I'm
[2:02:13] gonna be killed. I'm gonna be I'm gonna
[2:02:14] let myself get in the hands of sinful
[2:02:16] men."
[2:02:17] And they go and they're so discouraged,
[2:02:19] Brother Matt. And they're just fishing.
[2:02:23] And after that third day, they're
[2:02:24] fishing and they see a man on the shore
[2:02:26] and he calls out and he says, "Children,
[2:02:28] have you have you any meat? Have you
[2:02:30] caught anything?" Said, "No." He didn't
[2:02:32] know who it was. Said, "No, we've told
[2:02:35] all night. We haven't caught nothing."
[2:02:38] And this strange man from the shore
[2:02:41] said, "Cast on the other side."
[2:02:47] &gt;&gt; Well, didn't think of that. Let me try
[2:02:48] it. Amen.
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; And whenever they cast on the other
[2:02:52] side,
[2:02:54] there was so many fish in their net.
[2:02:57] That's
[2:02:57] &gt;&gt; right.
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; John said, "It is the Lord."
[2:03:02] [Music]
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; They recognized the works that he did
[2:03:07] before his crucifixion is the same works
[2:03:10] he's doing now.
[2:03:13] &gt;&gt; That's you.
[2:03:15] &gt;&gt; God has blessed you. And see, God could
[2:03:18] have called you, Brother Ray, in any
[2:03:20] church age he wanted. He could have
[2:03:22] called you and anointed you to give your
[2:03:23] life at the stake. He could have called
[2:03:25] you and anointed you, literally an
[2:03:27] anointing to take your family and go
[2:03:28] into the coliseum.
[2:03:31] You would have still been elect. You
[2:03:32] would have still been in the bride. You'
[2:03:34] still be in heaven. You'd be enjoying
[2:03:35] the presence of God. But he saved you as
[2:03:38] an end time people.
[2:03:41] He saved you as an end time people
[2:03:43] because he pressurized you for the age.
[2:03:46] Young people, there's a lot of pressure
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; for the the the boy. The young boys had
[2:03:53] their pressures. The young girls had
[2:03:54] their pressures. Pressures everywhere.
[2:03:56] The middle age had their pressures. The
[2:03:58] elderly had their pressures. Pressure.
[2:04:00] Pressure. But I've got good news for
[2:04:02] you. You're pressurized to fly higher.
[2:04:07] &gt;&gt; You're pressurized to believe this
[2:04:09] message
[2:04:10] [Music]
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; when it just blows the feathers out of
[2:04:14] some.
[2:04:16] They're not eagles,
[2:04:19] but yet God has called you to believe a
[2:04:21] message, the greatest message to hit the
[2:04:24] earth since the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:04:28] &gt;&gt; May we praise him for that. May we
[2:04:30] always honor him for that and be
[2:04:32] thankful for that.
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; We believe God sent a prophet with all
[2:04:37] of our heart. But brothers and sisters,
[2:04:38] we've got to realize and we've got to
[2:04:40] meet who he introduced.
[2:04:43] [Music]
[2:04:46] If you don't know him, if you haven't
[2:04:48] met,
[2:04:49] may you not stop day and night till you
[2:04:51] meet him. That's right.
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; Ask the Lord for the Holy Ghost. If you
[2:04:55] have the Holy Ghost, ask him for more.
[2:04:57] If you if you know, ask God, ask God for
[2:04:59] more revelation.
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; What did the prophet say? There's
[2:05:03] nothing of such prevailing power as
[2:05:06] revelation.
[2:05:09] Revelation. It's It's Satan that will
[2:05:11] make revelation spooky to you.
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; It's Satan that will take re Oh, that
[2:05:16] that's so revelated. It's not. The
[2:05:19] gospel is simple. The message is simple.
[2:05:22] If your understanding isn't to a certain
[2:05:24] place, as I said before, thank God for
[2:05:26] what you have, but it's there for you.
[2:05:28] That's
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; right.
[2:05:29] &gt;&gt; Walk in it.
[2:05:31] Love God with all your heart. Prepare
[2:05:34] your heart for his coming.
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; He loves you.
[2:05:40] I know we hear that all the time.
[2:05:43] But he loves you so much.
[2:05:48] He sent you this message.
[2:05:49] &gt;&gt; That's right. Come on.
[2:05:51] &gt;&gt; He didn't just save you. You're his
[2:05:53] bride.
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; And he sent you the most beautiful,
[2:05:57] glorious, powerful message to get you
[2:05:59] ready. And you're going to rule and
[2:06:02] reign with him, brother Nathan, as his
[2:06:04] queen,
[2:06:06] as as as a help meat for him, as the
[2:06:10] bride of Jesus Christ. Are we worthy?
[2:06:13] No.
[2:06:15] But God made you a silver dollar.
[2:06:18] Except that he made you a silver dollar.
[2:06:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Amen.
[2:06:30] As the deer panth for
[2:06:36] the water, so my soul longeth that
[2:06:43] after thee.
[2:06:49] You alone
[2:06:53] are my heart's
[2:06:56] desire
[2:06:57] and I long
[2:07:00] to worship
[2:07:03] thee.
[2:07:08] You alone
[2:07:12] are my strength, my shield.
[2:07:17] To you alone
[2:07:21] may my spirit
[2:07:25] yield.
[2:07:26] [Music]
[2:07:30] You alone
[2:07:34] are my heart
[2:07:37] desire
[2:07:39] and I long
[2:07:42] to worship
[2:07:44] you.
[2:07:48] [Music]
[2:07:49] You're my friend and you are
[2:07:56] my brother even though you are
[2:08:04] the king
[2:08:06] [Music]
[2:08:09] and I love you more than
[2:08:16] the other so much more
[2:08:21] than anything.
[2:08:23] [Music]
[2:08:29] You alone
[2:08:33] are my strength, my shield.
[2:08:39] To you alone
[2:08:43] may my spirit
[2:08:47] yield.
[2:08:52] You alone
[2:08:56] are my heart
[2:08:59] desire
[2:09:01] and I long
[2:09:04] to worship
[2:09:07] you.
[2:09:10] [Music]
[2:09:11] Oh, you alone
[2:09:16] are my strength,
[2:09:18] my shield.
[2:09:22] To you
[2:09:23] alone
[2:09:26] may my spirit
[2:09:30] give.
[2:09:35] You alone
[2:09:38] are my heart's
[2:09:42] desire
[2:09:43] and I long
[2:09:47] to worship
[2:09:50] you.
[2:09:53] Amen.
[2:09:56] Hallelujah.
[2:09:58] Aren't we thankful for this message?
[2:10:00] Hallelujah.
[2:10:01] &gt;&gt; Like brother William said, where where
[2:10:02] would we be if not for this message?
[2:10:05] This message had the power to take a
[2:10:08] sinner and and just turn his life from
[2:10:10] one thing
[2:10:11] &gt;&gt; and make him another, a son of God.
[2:10:14] &gt;&gt; I didn't have the power to save myself.
[2:10:16] I didn't have the power to save my son.
[2:10:18] But if you want to know the power of
[2:10:19] this message, there's an example.
[2:10:23] &gt;&gt; I took him at his word.
[2:10:25] &gt;&gt; I love him. Hallelujah.
[2:10:29] How great is our God,
[2:10:33] the splendor of a king,
[2:10:39] clothed in majesty.
[2:10:43] Let all the earth rejoice.
[2:10:46] All the earth rejoice.
[2:10:49] He wraps himself in life
[2:10:54] and darkness tries to hide and trembles
[2:10:59] at his voice. Trembles at his voice.
[2:11:04] How great
[2:11:07] is our God. Oh, sing with me. How great
[2:11:12] is our God and all.
[2:11:17] How great
[2:11:19] is our God.
[2:11:26] Age to age he stands
[2:11:30] and time is in his hand. Beginning at
[2:11:35] the end, beginning at the end.
[2:11:41] God in three in one.
[2:11:44] [Music]
[2:11:46] Father, spirit and son, the lion and the
[2:11:51] lamb. Lion and the lamb.

[2:12:10] is our God.

[2:12:31] is our God.

[2:13:51] is our God
[2:13:54] without the music.
[2:13:57] How great
[2:13:59] is our God.
[2:14:02] Well, sing with me. How great
[2:14:06] is our God.
[2:14:08] And all see how great
[2:14:13] how great
[2:14:16] is our God.

[2:15:24] free.
[2:15:26] Satan had me bound.

[2:17:38] Williams done for us.
