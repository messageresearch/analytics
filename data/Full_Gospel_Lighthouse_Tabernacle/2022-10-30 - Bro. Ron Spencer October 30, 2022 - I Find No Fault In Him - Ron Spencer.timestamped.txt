[1:04:40] good spot if you if you can kind of
[1:04:43] stay with me this morning
[1:04:46] first of all this is Jesus's prayer
[1:04:51] to give us wisdom of how to talk to him
[1:04:56] and it's very powerful in every words
[1:04:59] and after this manner therefore pray ye
[1:05:02] and let's pray it together
[1:05:04] Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed
[1:05:08] be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be
[1:05:12] done in earth as it is in heaven give us
[1:05:15] this day our daily bread and forgive us

[1:05:28] and the power and the glory forever amen
[1:05:33] amen Saint John chapter 18 and verse 38.
[1:05:40] and pilate saith unto him
[1:05:44] what is truth
[1:05:46] and that's a powerful question
[1:05:48] what is truth
[1:05:51] and when he had said this
[1:05:54] he went out again unto the Jews
[1:05:57] and said unto them
[1:06:01] I find in him
[1:06:03] no fault
[1:06:05] at all
[1:06:07] now remember who's saying this
[1:06:11] the enemy
[1:06:15] your enemy will have to testify
[1:06:19] now think about this your enemy will
[1:06:22] have to testify for you to get a rapture
[1:06:26] I find no fault
[1:06:32] you can be seated
[1:06:38] Hallelujah
[1:06:42] brother Branham says in what thank you
[1:06:44] of Christ he says
[1:06:45] let's call another Witness
[1:06:49] I don't believe there's a better witness
[1:06:51] that ever lived than his mother
[1:06:54] that's right met Mary
[1:06:58] you're the one
[1:07:00] who brought him here
[1:07:02] let's ask Mary the virgin
[1:07:05] whose son is he
[1:07:07] Mary you ought to know
[1:07:10] you're his mother
[1:07:13] and she said I I knew not a man
[1:07:17] Hallelujah
[1:07:19] but the Holy Ghost overshadowed me
[1:07:23] and said the holy thing
[1:07:27] will be called the son of God
[1:07:31] and I believe the Son of God don't you
[1:07:36] yes sir whose son is he
[1:07:40] why did he have to be born virgin birth
[1:07:43] because it was sex in the garden
[1:07:47] and he had to redeem every sin
[1:07:51] so he had to come through that type of a
[1:07:55] birth
[1:07:56] it could not be by man it had to be by
[1:07:59] God it could not be part Mary and part
[1:08:03] god it had to be all God
[1:08:08] let's ask the Roman soldier who pierced
[1:08:10] his side
[1:08:12] seen this blood coming out of him what
[1:08:15] thank ye about him
[1:08:17] he said
[1:08:18] surely that was the son of God
[1:08:23] remember the scripture says not one bone
[1:08:26] will be broken
[1:08:29] and they went to break these bones but
[1:08:31] the scripture said it will not one bone
[1:08:33] will be broken couldn't be a blemish on
[1:08:35] his side when that Soldier stuck that
[1:08:40] spear in his side it released his spirit
[1:08:43] and it released his blood and his water
[1:08:47] he did every one of us a favor
[1:08:51] oh
[1:08:53] Hallelujah
[1:08:55] let's think of Judas
[1:08:58] his enemy
[1:09:00] let's see what his enemy said Judas
[1:09:03] what do you think about him
[1:09:07] he said oh I have betrayed innocent
[1:09:10] blood
[1:09:13] give me a rope
[1:09:15] that I can hang myself
[1:09:18] and hear caiaphasis
[1:09:21] here's your money
[1:09:23] I betrayed innocent blood
[1:09:27] his enemy was testifying about him
[1:09:32] let's look at pilate the great lawyer a
[1:09:35] great man of the day a proclamator let's
[1:09:38] ask him what did you think about him
[1:09:40] Pilate
[1:09:42] come on out of hell and raise up here
[1:09:46] you say was he in Hell sure he was
[1:09:50] he is yet
[1:09:52] what do you say that
[1:09:55] I ain't judging him but hit by his own
[1:09:58] fruits
[1:10:00] what did you think about him pilate
[1:10:03] sitting there he said oh one day I was
[1:10:07] sitting there and I find no thought in
[1:10:08] him
[1:10:10] he said let's just turn the scene for a
[1:10:12] minute I can just see him standing there
[1:10:14] looking looks around in his angered eyes
[1:10:17] looking at him trying to find something
[1:10:19] wrong with him
[1:10:21] then he thought he would find some favor
[1:10:24] with Caesar and so forth
[1:10:27] and I hear a horse coming listening
[1:10:30] listen at it
[1:10:31] it's coming up the road and as hard as
[1:10:34] it can come and what is it it's one of
[1:10:36] the temple guards and he jumps off and
[1:10:38] he Dismounts it runs up before Pilate
[1:10:41] and Bows himself and hands in a note
[1:10:44] let's see it
[1:10:45] pallity opens up the node and he begins
[1:10:49] to read it and his face turns white his
[1:10:51] eyes are set his his knees Buckle
[1:10:55] together what's the matter let's look
[1:10:57] let's look over his shoulder and see
[1:11:00] what it is and when I read that I think
[1:11:02] about a prophet in a vision
[1:11:06] sorry and he's watching the scene happen
[1:11:11] and he said it's from his wife
[1:11:14] my beloved husband
[1:11:17] a heathen she was my beloved husband
[1:11:21] have nothing to do with this just man
[1:11:26] for today I've suffered many things in a
[1:11:29] dream he was he was white in his face
[1:11:33] his bones went out of joint his knees
[1:11:36] buckled together the great proclamator
[1:11:38] what do you think of him Pilate
[1:11:41] I must wash my hands
[1:11:45] no
[1:11:47] you never he's still on your hands
[1:11:51] he's on the hands of every man this
[1:11:54] afternoon that hears the message of
[1:11:56] Jesus Christ what do you think of him
[1:12:00] whose son is he why in birth he was
[1:12:03] wonderful
[1:12:04] in his birth did you believe it in his
[1:12:07] birth he was wonderful in wisdom there
[1:12:10] was never a man that spake like him do
[1:12:12] you believe that in sacrifice he was
[1:12:15] perfect in death he was a redeemer when
[1:12:18] he arose he proved he was God
[1:12:23] he said he was and when he was here on
[1:12:25] Earth he said he was God and he looked
[1:12:28] like God he acted like God he preached
[1:12:31] like God he rose like God
[1:12:34] he was God
[1:12:37] brother Brown said either he was God or
[1:12:40] he was the greatest deceiver that the
[1:12:42] world has ever known
[1:12:43] [Applause]
[1:12:47] Emmanuel
[1:12:50] veiled in flesh walking among man he was
[1:12:55] God Emmanuel he fulfilled the father he
[1:13:00] thrilled the hearts of the points Great
[1:13:02] Men down Through the Ages Every Man
[1:13:05] that's ever amounted to a hill of beans
[1:13:07] was somebody that put their trust in him
[1:13:12] as a Son of God I like that every man
[1:13:16] that and every man that ever amounted to
[1:13:19] a hill of beings was somebody that put
[1:13:22] their trust in him
[1:13:25] that's where I put my trust today
[1:13:29] [Applause]
[1:13:36] Hallelujah
[1:13:39] and it came to pass as they were alone
[1:13:41] praying
[1:13:43] his disciples were with him and they
[1:13:45] asked him
[1:13:46] and he asked them
[1:13:49] whom say the people that I am
[1:13:53] and the answer said John the Baptist
[1:13:56] but some say Elias and others
[1:14:01] that one of the old prophets has risen
[1:14:03] again
[1:14:05] and he said unto them
[1:14:07] but whom say ye
[1:14:11] that I am
[1:14:13] and Peter answering said
[1:14:16] the Christ of God
[1:14:21] what a statement
[1:14:23] I found this this week and I thought it
[1:14:25] was incredible saying
[1:14:28] I've given God a million reasons
[1:14:32] not to love me
[1:14:37] and none of them changed his mind
[1:14:52] I want you to say this with me maybe the
[1:14:54] next day you have a complex or fear
[1:14:56] situation devil beating you around I
[1:14:59] want you to just kind of say this back
[1:15:00] to him
[1:15:01] I've given God a million reasons
[1:15:06] not to love me
[1:15:08] and none of them
[1:15:10] changed his mind
[1:15:19] I'd like to share with you this morning
[1:15:21] he's not on a cross
[1:15:24] neither is he in a tomb
[1:15:27] but he is Our Risen Savior
[1:15:30] he came to Earth to die and he
[1:15:33] accomplished his purpose
[1:15:35] and today he is king of kings and Lord
[1:15:37] of lords he is our sacrifice our Lamb of
[1:15:41] God and we stand here today declaring
[1:15:44] that he is the worthy lamb and we say
[1:15:47] there's no thought in him
[1:15:52] in Revelations chapter 5 we pick it up
[1:15:55] and and I saw in the right hand of him
[1:15:57] that set upon the throne written within
[1:15:59] and on the backside seal with Seven
[1:16:02] Seals
[1:16:03] and I saw a strong angel proclaiming
[1:16:06] with a loud voice
[1:16:07] who is worthy to open the book and to
[1:16:11] loose the seals thereof
[1:16:13] and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth
[1:16:16] neither under the Earth was a was able
[1:16:19] to open the book and to look there on
[1:16:23] and I wept much because no man was found
[1:16:26] worthy to open the book and to read the
[1:16:28] book neither to look thereon now I want
[1:16:31] you to just stop just for a moment and
[1:16:33] think about this of all the prophets and
[1:16:36] all the Great Men of all the ages
[1:16:39] in their Humanity of being Fallen human
[1:16:43] beings
[1:16:45] could not redeem themselves
[1:16:50] they couldn't pay the price for their
[1:16:52] own Redemption much less redeem all
[1:16:55] humankind
[1:16:59] are you with me there's a lot of
[1:17:01] brilliant men that can read the Bible
[1:17:03] and quote the Bible from beginning to
[1:17:05] end but they can't pay their own price
[1:17:08] of redemption
[1:17:10] and even John as he's standing there and
[1:17:13] the strong Angel proclaims who is Worthy
[1:17:16] Moses couldn't step forth Abraham
[1:17:19] couldn't step forth Isaac couldn't step
[1:17:22] forth Enoch who had wrote the Bible in a
[1:17:26] pyramid
[1:17:30] and actually walk with God and one day
[1:17:32] God just took him home
[1:17:35] Elijah the spirit of God in a man
[1:17:39] but there were thoughts in him
[1:17:43] each of these men
[1:17:47] each of these men had an accuser
[1:17:51] and God built his own accuser
[1:17:56] the accuser takes a tally
[1:17:59] of your wrongs and your thoughts
[1:18:04] it's got books of memory
[1:18:07] of where you made mistakes
[1:18:09] the scripture tells us that all have
[1:18:12] sinned and come short of the glory of
[1:18:14] God
[1:18:15] all have sinned and come short of the
[1:18:18] glory of God
[1:18:19] brother on but I haven't done no bad
[1:18:22] since our thoughts
[1:18:25] our very thoughts would condemn us today
[1:18:29] our attitudes our opinions on things
[1:18:34] we get sideways at times we get turned
[1:18:37] around and there is a book somewhere or
[1:18:40] another that is the accuser of the
[1:18:42] brethren
[1:18:44] all right yeah
[1:18:47] where's your brother
[1:18:50] Moses had to write about his own faults
[1:18:57] we heard last night that he turned down
[1:19:01] he turned down being pharaoh
[1:19:04] you know that just kind of falls off of
[1:19:05] her lips sometimes
[1:19:07] but we don't realize the implications
[1:19:09] that he went from
[1:19:11] he went he went from being the leader of
[1:19:15] the world
[1:19:18] to living in a tent with a hot tempered
[1:19:22] wife
[1:19:26] a pauper
[1:19:29] to where that the hot desert Suns would
[1:19:33] burn him
[1:19:34] and the accuser beating him for 40 years
[1:19:38] and living with his being a murderer and
[1:19:42] and making bad decisions brother man
[1:19:45] said he looked out the same window that
[1:19:47] Pharaoh Ramses looked out of
[1:19:50] Ramsay saw just people that were slaves
[1:19:53] and ants and and Moses looked out of
[1:19:57] there and he saw them as God's chosen
[1:20:00] people
[1:20:03] and when God puts a seed in your life
[1:20:05] and a gift in your life you can run to
[1:20:08] the ends of the world
[1:20:10] and you can't get away from it
[1:20:15] Hallelujah well I'm not going to serve
[1:20:17] God if God's got a seed on the inside of
[1:20:19] you you can go to Alaska you can go to
[1:20:21] Russia you can go to the you can go to
[1:20:24] any place in the world God knows how to
[1:20:27] find you
[1:20:29] and he's not in the kind of business to
[1:20:31] lose you
[1:20:38] no human
[1:20:41] could take credit
[1:20:43] for our Redemption
[1:20:46] no mortal man
[1:20:49] could take credit
[1:20:50] we needed a savior
[1:20:54] the blood of bulls and goats could pour
[1:20:57] rivers of blood
[1:20:59] it didn't save a man it only covered his
[1:21:02] sins
[1:21:03] it didn't take the sin desire out of his
[1:21:06] life
[1:21:08] David cried
[1:21:10] they all wanted God to they could feel
[1:21:13] his anointing but they they knew
[1:21:16] themselves and the flaws in their lives
[1:21:19] they knew that they needed that God that
[1:21:24] would come and touch them to live on the
[1:21:26] inside of them
[1:21:28] Moses knew Moses Abraham knew Abraham
[1:21:32] David knew David
[1:21:38] we needed more than a temple built by
[1:21:42] mortal hands
[1:21:53] notice these words John says
[1:21:56] I went much
[1:21:59] because no man
[1:22:01] was found worthy to open
[1:22:04] and to read the book
[1:22:06] neither to look thereon
[1:22:12] listen if
[1:22:14] if God doesn't step forward
[1:22:16] we're lost
[1:22:21] and you're going to live to be 120 years
[1:22:23] life's short
[1:22:29] I don't want to serve him just because I
[1:22:30] don't want to go to hell
[1:22:34] I don't want to serve him just because
[1:22:35] I'm I'm afraid
[1:22:37] I want to serve him because of love
[1:22:43] life
[1:22:45] courage
[1:22:47] the strength that he gives me
[1:22:50] the grace and the mercy that carries us
[1:22:53] from day to day
[1:22:55] [Music]
[1:22:58] one of the elders responded
[1:23:02] we've not
[1:23:05] the lion of the tribe of Judah
[1:23:09] the root of David
[1:23:11] hath prevailed
[1:23:14] he's wrestled with Satan
[1:23:18] he's paid the price of redemption
[1:23:21] hack prevailed to open the book and to
[1:23:23] loose the Seven Seals thereof those
[1:23:26] Seven Seals contained who Jesus Christ
[1:23:29] really was
[1:23:31] and who you really are
[1:23:37] and I'd be held in low in the midst of
[1:23:39] the throne in the four beasts and in the
[1:23:41] midst of the altars instead of lamb
[1:23:45] as it had been slain having salmon horns
[1:23:48] and seven eyes which are the seven
[1:23:50] spirits sent forth into all the Earth
[1:23:54] one in each age
[1:23:56] and he came and he took the book out of
[1:23:58] the right hand of him it was a book of
[1:24:01] redemption it was your Bible that you
[1:24:03] hold in your hand he then took the right
[1:24:05] out of the hand of him that sat on the
[1:24:07] throne and when he had taken the book
[1:24:09] and the four beasts and the Four and
[1:24:11] Twenty Elders fell down before the lamb
[1:24:13] having having every one of them hearts
[1:24:17] and golden vials of odors which are the
[1:24:20] prayers of the Saints
[1:24:23] and they sung a new song
[1:24:27] saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book
[1:24:30] and to open the seals thereof for thou
[1:24:32] was slain and has redeemed us to God by
[1:24:36] the by to God by thy blood out of every
[1:24:39] Kindred tongue and people and nation and
[1:24:43] has made us
[1:24:45] unto our God's Kings and Priests and we
[1:24:49] shall reign with him on the Earth
[1:24:52] without this book
[1:24:55] without this Redemption
[1:24:57] there is no reigning with him
[1:25:03] and I beheld and heard a voice of them
[1:25:05] ain't Mighty Angels round about the
[1:25:08] throne and the beasts and the elders and
[1:25:10] the number of them was ten thousands
[1:25:12] times ten thousands times thousands and
[1:25:14] thousands
[1:25:16] saying with a loud voice
[1:25:18] Worthy is the Lamb
[1:25:23] that was slain to receive power and
[1:25:27] riches and wisdom and strength and honor
[1:25:32] and glory and blessings
[1:25:35] and I want to say this to you you were
[1:25:38] identified in him
[1:25:44] Hallelujah
[1:25:47] Hallelujah
[1:25:49] now the scripture says about him as a
[1:25:52] prophecy
[1:25:54] in Isaiah chapter 53.
[1:25:57] who hath believed I report
[1:26:00] and to whom
[1:26:02] this is a powerful scripture
[1:26:04] and to whom is the arm of the Lord
[1:26:06] revealed
[1:26:09] it's not going to be revealed to
[1:26:11] everybody
[1:26:11] [Music]
[1:26:13] Benjamin Netanyahu this week
[1:26:19] went back to the old Testament and said
[1:26:21] this land belongs to us
[1:26:23] he stood in a speech and he said we must
[1:26:27] never forget who we are let me just say
[1:26:29] this here you must never forget who you
[1:26:31] are
[1:26:34] the Devil May whisper in your ear and
[1:26:37] tell you a lot of things but never let
[1:26:39] him forget who you are
[1:26:41] because you are the power that you have
[1:26:45] on the inside of you is where you know
[1:26:48] who you are not just enough to know who
[1:26:51] he is but to know who you are
[1:26:53] [Applause]
[1:27:01] for he shall grow up before him as a
[1:27:03] tender plant as a root out of dry ground
[1:27:06] he hath no form no calmness and when we
[1:27:09] shall see him there is no beauty that we
[1:27:10] should desire him he is despised and
[1:27:14] rejected of men
[1:27:16] a Man of Sorrows acquainted with grief
[1:27:19] and we hear this before our faces from
[1:27:21] him he was despised and we esteemed him
[1:27:24] not
[1:27:25] surely he hath borne our griefs
[1:27:33] buried our sorrows
[1:27:40] yet we did esteem him stricken
[1:27:44] smitten of God and afflicted
[1:27:49] this is all of our favorite scripture
[1:27:51] but he was wounded
[1:27:56] another Homer
[1:27:59] when we would pray for people at the
[1:28:01] hospital
[1:28:03] he would pray he was wounded for our
[1:28:06] transgressions
[1:28:07] he took those stripes at pilate's
[1:28:10] judgment Hall therefore we could be
[1:28:12] healed
[1:28:14] he wasn't being for uh irreverent with
[1:28:18] the scriptures
[1:28:19] he was quoting the scripture and then
[1:28:21] given the promise and then given people
[1:28:24] Faith get up and walk out of this bed
[1:28:29] but he was wounded for our
[1:28:30] transgressions
[1:28:32] he was bruised for our iniquities
[1:28:36] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[1:28:40] him and with his stripes
[1:28:43] we are healed
[1:28:50] the scripture says in John chapter 1 and
[1:28:53] verse 1 in the beginning what's the word
[1:28:55] and the Word was with God and was God
[1:28:59] the same was in the beginning with God
[1:29:02] and all things were made by him and
[1:29:04] without him was not anything made that
[1:29:07] was made that only explained it all
[1:29:09] right now
[1:29:11] in him was life and life was the light
[1:29:13] of men and the light shineth in darkness
[1:29:16] and darkness comprehended that not there
[1:29:19] was a man sent from God whose name was
[1:29:21] John and the same came for a witness to
[1:29:24] Bear witness of that lot
[1:29:28] remember Jesus even comes and testifies
[1:29:31] about John none greater
[1:29:34] than John and he said ought the same
[1:29:39] came for a witness to Bear witness of
[1:29:40] that light that all men threw him
[1:29:44] might believe
[1:29:46] he was not that light
[1:29:49] but he was sent to Bear witness of that
[1:29:53] Lodge
[1:29:54] that was the True Light
[1:29:57] which which lighteth every man
[1:30:00] that cometh into the world
[1:30:03] he was in the world and the world was
[1:30:06] made by him and the world knew him not
[1:30:10] there's a shirt there is a sermon in
[1:30:13] every sentence
[1:30:20] he came into his own
[1:30:24] and his own received him not
[1:30:27] but as many as received him
[1:30:31] to them gave he power
[1:30:34] to become sons of God
[1:30:37] even to them that believe on his name
[1:30:42] which were
[1:30:44] which were born not a blood
[1:30:47] nor of the will of Flesh nor the will of
[1:30:51] man but of God
[1:30:53] and the Word was made flesh
[1:30:56] and dwelt among us and we beheld his
[1:30:59] glory what a phenomenal sermon John
[1:31:03] under a prophetic Eagle anointing is
[1:31:07] writing this sermon down
[1:31:09] and the Word was made flesh
[1:31:13] and dwelt Among Us
[1:31:16] and we beheld his glory
[1:31:20] millions of Jews was in the land
[1:31:24] but a handful of men recognized this was
[1:31:28] God
[1:31:29] [Music]
[1:31:33] this was God
[1:31:43] you've heard me read this to you I'll
[1:31:45] read it again just a portion of it
[1:31:47] he came from the bosom of the father to
[1:31:50] the bosom of a woman
[1:31:52] he put on Humanity that he might put on
[1:31:55] divinity
[1:31:56] he became the son of man that he might
[1:31:59] become that we might become sons of God
[1:32:01] and that is phenomenally powerful
[1:32:07] he came from heaven where Rivers never
[1:32:10] freeze
[1:32:11] winds never blow
[1:32:13] Frost never chills the air
[1:32:16] flowers Never Fade
[1:32:18] one is never sick there's no Undertakers
[1:32:22] no graveyards no one ever dies no one
[1:32:26] ever is buried
[1:32:30] he was born contrary to the laws of
[1:32:33] nature he lived in popular in in poverty
[1:32:37] in total obscurity only crossed the
[1:32:40] boundary of his Land once in childhood
[1:32:43] had no wealth he had no influence no
[1:32:46] training no formal education his
[1:32:49] relatives were inconspicuous and and
[1:32:53] influent un influential in infancy he
[1:32:56] startled Kings
[1:32:59] in Boyhood he startled wise men
[1:33:03] in manhood he ruled the course of nature
[1:33:06] he walked on the billas of the sea
[1:33:10] he healed the multitudes without
[1:33:12] medicine and made no charge for his
[1:33:14] service he never wrote a book
[1:33:17] yet all the libraries of the country
[1:33:19] could not hold the books that had been
[1:33:21] written about him
[1:33:27] he never wrote a song
[1:33:30] you know
[1:33:32] yet he has furnished the theme of more
[1:33:34] songs
[1:33:35] than all the songwriters combined
[1:33:39] he never founded a college yet all the
[1:33:41] schools together cannot boast of as many
[1:33:44] students
[1:33:46] as he has
[1:33:51] he never practiced psychology
[1:33:54] yet is healed more broken hearts
[1:34:01] than doctors have healed broken bodies
[1:34:04] he never marshaled an army
[1:34:07] he never drafted a soldier fired a gun
[1:34:10] yet no leader has ever had more
[1:34:13] volunteers
[1:34:15] who under his orders have made Rebels
[1:34:18] stock arms
[1:34:20] of surrender without a shot
[1:34:23] being fired
[1:34:27] Jesus stood there and said let not your
[1:34:29] heart be troubled
[1:34:33] you believe in God believe also with me
[1:34:38] in my father's house are many mansions
[1:34:41] and if it were not so I would have told
[1:34:43] you
[1:34:44] I go to prepare a place for you
[1:34:49] I think about that scripture when
[1:34:51] brother Branham is speaking four hours
[1:34:53] on future home
[1:34:56] no way can mortal man even as a prophet
[1:34:59] can stand there and describe the beauty
[1:35:01] of what our new Heavens was going to be
[1:35:03] like
[1:35:05] streets of gold
[1:35:08] transparent gold
[1:35:11] thank you
[1:35:12] walls of Jasper
[1:35:15] Gates apparel and that's one of the most
[1:35:19] precious items in the entire world peril
[1:35:28] it's hard to fathom
[1:35:31] Rivers flowing
[1:35:35] from the Throne of God
[1:35:37] said flowing down over that City
[1:35:40] and he said he built it 1500 miles high
[1:35:43] in 1500 miles wide
[1:35:46] honey
[1:35:48] and he said it that Divine architect
[1:35:51] he said it's built it so beautiful in in
[1:35:55] such a way until it feels like you're
[1:35:57] going to be walking on flat ground
[1:36:02] get an engineer
[1:36:05] to try to build such a city
[1:36:07] with Mortal Humanity
[1:36:10] go walk on the the pyramids
[1:36:14] in Egypt you're going to need a lot of
[1:36:15] steps
[1:36:17] but God Divine he so designed your city
[1:36:21] where he's going to have you to live at
[1:36:26] where he's going to have you to live at
[1:36:30] where you're going to live and he's got
[1:36:32] it so designed
[1:36:35] not a leaf ever false the grass never
[1:36:38] weathers the flowers you're talking
[1:36:41] about bershard Gardens and some of the
[1:36:43] gardens and and some of the places that
[1:36:45] I've been how beautiful they are but
[1:36:47] still they wither and the seasons come
[1:36:50] and change but in that Gardens
[1:36:54] the leaves will never fall off
[1:36:57] there will never be a Bad Day in heaven
[1:37:05] Hallelujah
[1:37:14] I go to prepare a place for you
[1:37:17] or powerful words
[1:37:19] as he stood there with them
[1:37:22] this is just shortly before Calvary
[1:37:26] all right
[1:37:28] hello Stephen
[1:37:30] they've witnessed him walk on water
[1:37:37] spoke
[1:37:38] to a storm
[1:37:41] and they witnessed him
[1:37:43] it just become glass
[1:37:48] and they used the term it said
[1:37:50] never man
[1:37:53] speak like this man
[1:37:58] he exhibited such power
[1:38:02] with such humility
[1:38:08] had no house to live in had no Chariot
[1:38:11] to ride
[1:38:15] had no Castle to go to
[1:38:20] and yet he could control nature
[1:38:27] don't tell me God can't do the
[1:38:28] impossibility for you
[1:38:36] well brother Ron you're you stand there
[1:38:38] with cancer still in your body and they
[1:38:40] say it's just as much
[1:38:42] hmm
[1:38:43] what cancer
[1:38:58] the god that spoke to a storm can speak
[1:39:01] to that
[1:39:05] we're taught not to be be fearful of it
[1:39:08] oh it causes effects I've had I went on
[1:39:11] a hunting trip and
[1:39:13] I was sick you know and I had problems
[1:39:17] but that's just temporary
[1:39:21] there'll be a day to where that can't
[1:39:23] touch me
[1:39:25] [Applause]
[1:39:34] this might be to somebody that's
[1:39:36] listening
[1:39:38] but it's been said by more more than
[1:39:40] just a few men
[1:39:43] Billy Graham was one of the last ones
[1:39:45] that would say say it nationally or even
[1:39:47] to the world
[1:39:49] he said if you hear Billy Brown Billy
[1:39:52] Graham died
[1:39:53] he said don't believe it for a second
[1:39:57] because I'll be more alive there than I
[1:39:59] am here
[1:40:02] and if you can grasp that
[1:40:05] Paul said it as well a man that got his
[1:40:09] head chopped off
[1:40:11] and he said to be absent from this body
[1:40:16] listen you can't do anything with a man
[1:40:19] that knows his destiny
[1:40:22] I'm saying powerful words right here you
[1:40:25] can't do anything to a man that knows
[1:40:27] his destiny
[1:40:29] I know where I'm going
[1:40:32] I know the situation I'm well aware in
[1:40:36] this Humanity I make struggle but in
[1:40:38] another Realm
[1:40:41] to be absent from this body is to be
[1:40:44] present with the Lord
[1:40:45] [Applause]
[1:41:00] a couple scriptures later
[1:41:02] Jesus saith unto them
[1:41:06] I am the way
[1:41:09] the truth
[1:41:12] and the life
[1:41:15] there's not another way than Jesus
[1:41:22] there's not 14 different ways
[1:41:26] he is away
[1:41:28] as a matter of fact he's the only way
[1:41:32] to escape hell to escape the tribulation
[1:41:35] period this is the way
[1:41:41] to know me is not to know too much but
[1:41:44] to know him gives you eternal life
[1:41:48] no man cometh unto the father
[1:41:51] but by me
[1:41:54] John chapter 3 and verse 16 for God so
[1:41:57] loved the world
[1:41:59] that he gave his only begotten son that
[1:42:02] whosoever believeth in him should not
[1:42:05] perish but have everlasting life
[1:42:08] for God sent his son into the world to
[1:42:11] condemn to condemn the world but to to
[1:42:14] but that the world through him might be
[1:42:17] saved
[1:42:18] and he that believeth on him
[1:42:22] is not condemned but he that believeth
[1:42:25] not is condemned already
[1:42:28] you don't have to wait on the Judgment
[1:42:30] because he hath not believed in the name
[1:42:34] of the only begotten son of God
[1:42:49] Hallelujah
[1:42:54] you say
[1:42:57] well I had my ups and downs
[1:43:01] ups and downs
[1:43:04] I would advise you to go to God
[1:43:08] and stay there until you're really born
[1:43:10] again
[1:43:12] When Trials and troubles and heartaches
[1:43:15] and disappointments sets in something
[1:43:17] holds
[1:43:19] not not you holding something's holding
[1:43:22] you
[1:43:25] it isn't a question whether I hold on or
[1:43:29] not
[1:43:31] it's a question
[1:43:35] whether he held
[1:43:38] or not
[1:43:41] it isn't looking at me
[1:43:45] it's looking at him
[1:43:55] brother Branham I'm not even worthy to
[1:43:57] be saved
[1:43:58] he said I told him no you're not
[1:44:03] that's a pretty that's a pretty powerful
[1:44:05] statement and no you're not
[1:44:09] he started weeping he said he said I've
[1:44:11] been trying since I was in 1940 to get
[1:44:14] saved but I find myself not worthy
[1:44:17] and he just clears it up for him you'll
[1:44:20] never be worthy
[1:44:21] [Applause]
[1:44:26] you'll never be worthy
[1:44:30] then I could never be saved he says oh
[1:44:32] no
[1:44:33] it isn't you that he's looking at
[1:44:37] it's him
[1:44:40] God don't look at you
[1:44:42] he looks at him
[1:44:46] if you can find any fault in him then
[1:44:49] you can't be saved
[1:44:51] but if there's no fault in him
[1:44:54] then you're all right the blemish that
[1:44:57] you find in him is you
[1:45:01] there's no blemish in you in him
[1:45:07] then now there's no blemish in you
[1:45:12] [Applause]
[1:45:15] quit letting the devil beat you around
[1:45:17] the bush
[1:45:20] God washes our blemishes away
[1:45:26] and then we can say I find no fault
[1:45:37] it's kind of like a man that goes and he
[1:45:40] says
[1:45:41] he said he'll start to die and with this
[1:45:44] disease on the doctor's doorsteps
[1:45:48] and he said the doctor has a remedy
[1:45:51] to give the man for his disease
[1:45:54] and he can help him with his medicine
[1:46:01] now
[1:46:03] you know in the early days preachers
[1:46:05] would preach against doctors
[1:46:07] you didn't have faith if you went to
[1:46:09] doctors or you didn't have faith if you
[1:46:11] went to Medicine
[1:46:12] and you know three years ago or two and
[1:46:15] a half years ago when I started having
[1:46:18] to go and begin to take
[1:46:21] chemotherapy which I take it every day
[1:46:24] still take as much as I've ever taken
[1:46:27] and
[1:46:29] take 27 pills in the morning
[1:46:32] and just to get my day started
[1:46:35] and I had a lot of people telling me
[1:46:36] said you don't have faith well they they
[1:46:38] didn't get it from Brother Branham
[1:46:43] and I just thought I'd go ahead and
[1:46:45] clear that up they they didn't get not
[1:46:47] believe in doctors because brother
[1:46:49] Branham had Dr Sam Adair
[1:46:51] and then he went to the Mayo Clinic and
[1:46:54] if you want to do a little home research
[1:46:55] on the Mayo Clinic they're some of the
[1:46:57] best doctors in the entire world
[1:47:00] and they actually did a study on brother
[1:47:02] Branham being able to see visions and I
[1:47:05] actually was in a home to where that I
[1:47:08] was in as a chimney sweep at that time
[1:47:09] and it was a it was a guy that was a a
[1:47:12] professor and his son was working at the
[1:47:15] Mayo Clinic and and you know he was just
[1:47:18] talking to me we'd been at his house
[1:47:19] several times and me and Dad was there
[1:47:22] together and we'd cleaned his chimney we
[1:47:24] was done and we were just talking he was
[1:47:26] just
[1:47:28] you know
[1:47:30] somebody's phone's going off and I hear
[1:47:33] it is it yours
[1:47:35] foreign
[1:47:36] all right
[1:47:37] well it's not God calling I'll never
[1:47:39] forget brother Homer one time when he
[1:47:40] was having a funeral here
[1:47:43] we put two seats right here and Homer
[1:47:46] wanted to sit near the stage here and
[1:47:47] his phone went off and he was always the
[1:47:50] guy that would say now he would always
[1:47:53] say your phone off and they say yeah
[1:47:55] it's awful well his phone's going off
[1:47:57] and he said
[1:47:58] hey folks it's it's not God
[1:48:05] you never got to meet him you're going
[1:48:06] to enjoy meeting him
[1:48:09] but anyway this man began to speak to me
[1:48:12] and he said you know he said my son
[1:48:14] is in research at the at the Mayo Clinic
[1:48:18] and he said you know there was you know
[1:48:20] how you have a dream
[1:48:21] he said you go to sleep you're in a deep
[1:48:23] sleep and deeper sleeps and he said
[1:48:25] dreams are about a second
[1:48:27] and a half he said you feel like that
[1:48:30] you dreamed all night long as about a
[1:48:33] second second and a half
[1:48:35] well I had a dream last night
[1:48:38] I dreamed that I was at uh
[1:48:41] at a house at a house of a sister uh
[1:48:45] shiftlet what's her what's her name
[1:48:50] June I was at June's house and she gave
[1:48:53] me a three monkeys See No Evil
[1:48:57] speak no evil and hear no evil
[1:49:00] that dream seemed like it went on
[1:49:02] forever a second and a half I knew this
[1:49:04] was in my sermon this morning I thought
[1:49:06] what an interesting dream
[1:49:08] she's going to give me three monkeys
[1:49:11] she hears this she don't have to do that
[1:49:16] anyway this man says you know a dream he
[1:49:19] said you
[1:49:21] he said you literally feel like you're
[1:49:22] living stirs your emotions it makes you
[1:49:25] mad it makes you cry
[1:49:27] and he said
[1:49:28] really not much to a dream he said but
[1:49:30] you just fall into it he said but there
[1:49:33] was a man
[1:49:34] said his conscience and his
[1:49:37] subconscious lay together
[1:49:40] now this guy don't know beans about who
[1:49:42] William brownham is and he's standing
[1:49:45] there talking to two message preachers
[1:49:48] come on God orchestrates everything
[1:49:52] and he's standing there talking to two
[1:49:55] message preachers and this guy is has a
[1:49:59] son working at Mayo Clinic
[1:50:03] researching all of these years later
[1:50:06] kind of how that worked and he said this
[1:50:09] man would would not dream dreams in the
[1:50:11] day but he would see visions and it
[1:50:14] would transport him as much as 40 days
[1:50:16] back and said there's there's stories
[1:50:19] that said it transported him all week by
[1:50:21] up to the days of Jesus
[1:50:25] [Applause]
[1:50:29] I said was his name William Branham he
[1:50:32] said yes that's a fact that's a that's
[1:50:34] who it that's who he's studying
[1:50:41] I've told you all of that to give you
[1:50:42] this quote
[1:50:44] now he said the doctor has the remedy
[1:50:49] to give the man of for his disease
[1:50:52] and he can help him with medicine
[1:50:55] but the man will not listen to him he
[1:50:58] just refuses to take the doctor's
[1:51:00] medicine well the man could be so close
[1:51:02] to the doctor
[1:51:04] he could he could be on the doorstep and
[1:51:08] die and die on his office step and live
[1:51:11] door neighbors to him and die with the
[1:51:15] disease that the medicine is laying in
[1:51:18] the doctor's office that could cure him
[1:51:24] now it isn't the doctor's fault notice
[1:51:27] what he does with this
[1:51:29] it isn't the doctor's fault
[1:51:33] it isn't because there's no medicine
[1:51:36] there
[1:51:39] it's because the man refuses the remedy
[1:51:45] stay with me put on your seat belt he
[1:51:49] dies because he refuses the remedy that
[1:51:52] the doctor has for his disease
[1:51:56] so it is with the church today
[1:51:59] men and women die in pews in sin because
[1:52:03] they refuse the remedy
[1:52:06] there is a bomb in Gilead
[1:52:09] there's a physician there but people
[1:52:12] refuse to take the remedy they don't
[1:52:14] want it it's a dangerous thing to refuse
[1:52:17] the doctor's medicine
[1:52:19] you got scarlet fever pneumonia whatever
[1:52:22] it is and the doctor gives you medicine
[1:52:25] and you just pour it out
[1:52:27] that's a dangerous thing
[1:52:31] because you might just die
[1:52:35] but how much more is it dangerous
[1:52:39] to pour out the bomb of God
[1:52:42] 's remedy
[1:52:50] let me just say this to you now
[1:52:52] you don't have to
[1:52:54] think very far
[1:52:56] to think about people in your family and
[1:52:59] in your life
[1:53:01] and I'm not being judgmental now
[1:53:05] that have turned down the remedy
[1:53:09] and the remedy was offered
[1:53:13] listen You'll have to walk Stomp jump
[1:53:17] over the blood of Jesus Christ to go to
[1:53:20] hell
[1:53:23] God has created every roadblock that he
[1:53:27] can for you
[1:53:28] to stop you long enough to speak to your
[1:53:31] heart he has chased you down
[1:53:34] you heard a song last night that was so
[1:53:37] powerful
[1:53:38] he ran to me
[1:53:44] pull me to his chest
[1:53:47] he left 90 and 9 and went and got you
[1:53:52] he don't just do that to waste his time
[1:53:56] help me lay it right now in his place
[1:53:59] God's on a mission
[1:54:02] he's on a mission and that mission will
[1:54:05] not fail
[1:54:07] there will be a bride
[1:54:11] everything that we have made of to put
[1:54:14] us in a Rapture is right here with us
[1:54:18] he wants us so live in your life
[1:54:30] well it's the doctor's fault
[1:54:33] it's the preacher's fault
[1:54:35] it's brother branham's fault
[1:54:40] here a while back
[1:54:42] maybe a few years ago or I got a
[1:54:44] movement
[1:54:46] they started pointing out brother
[1:54:47] branham's faults
[1:54:50] you know what then they started pointing
[1:54:52] out Jesus's faults
[1:54:55] then they started pointing out the
[1:54:56] Bible's faults
[1:55:00] well you've you've missed the whole
[1:55:02] picture to start off with
[1:55:06] Jesus could say things
[1:55:09] that brother Branham could say
[1:55:13] I came from God I'm going back to God
[1:55:17] we said because we're in him
[1:55:20] but we were born
[1:55:23] of Charlie and Christine Spencer and all
[1:55:26] the sins of their families came down on
[1:55:28] me and I had to be born again
[1:55:30] Jesus could say my meat my flesh is meat
[1:55:36] indeed brother Branham couldn't say that
[1:55:39] brother Bynum said I am a sinner saved
[1:55:42] by grace
[1:55:43] Jesus never said those words
[1:55:47] I'm a sinner he took on sin
[1:55:53] that you could become him
[1:55:56] he went to hell so you could go to
[1:56:00] heaven
[1:56:05] he walked through the regions of the
[1:56:08] Lost
[1:56:10] so you would never have to take a
[1:56:12] footstep there
[1:56:14] let me just let me just say it as I'm
[1:56:17] coming to a close I'll speak in a couple
[1:56:19] of weeks on this but let me just say
[1:56:21] you're as close to hell as you'll ever
[1:56:23] be
[1:56:35] what a statement you are as close to
[1:56:38] hell as you'll ever be
[1:56:41] and sinners are as close to Heaven as
[1:56:45] they'll ever be
[1:56:50] virtual
[1:56:55] we must be careful
[1:56:58] when we point out one another's mistakes
[1:57:02] and I want to leave you with this
[1:57:04] thought
[1:57:05] because as Mortals no mortal has a right
[1:57:09] to stand in the presence of God and
[1:57:12] condemn another mortal
[1:57:18] whether you know it or not a person can
[1:57:20] make an ultimate sin and ask God to
[1:57:22] forgive us that's not giving you a
[1:57:24] license to repeat it
[1:57:27] that's not making Grace a disgrace but
[1:57:30] when you ask God to forgive you of your
[1:57:32] sins the god of Heaven that created the
[1:57:34] sun moon and stars can never remember
[1:57:37] that ever again
[1:57:39] [Music]
[1:57:40] he can never hold it against you because
[1:57:43] he prepared a blood for that
[1:57:50] you talking about the power of the blood
[1:57:52] of Jesus Christ what can we wash away my
[1:57:56] sins nothing but the blood of Jesus what
[1:57:59] can make me whole again
[1:58:01] nothing but the blood of Jesus
[1:58:09] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:58:20] Oh Glory to God
[1:58:24] when we walk through that corners of
[1:58:26] Heaven
[1:58:29] I don't know quite how to be brother
[1:58:31] Graham tried to explain it but
[1:58:33] kind of like a parade when we enter
[1:58:37] oh and we'll sing Amazing Grace
[1:58:41] as we walk in
[1:58:43] and they said angels will stand
[1:58:46] they don't know they can't sing with us
[1:58:48] because they don't
[1:58:49] understand Grace
[1:58:53] we do
[1:58:55] we know how close we came
[1:59:00] and we wasn't even redeemable ourselves
[1:59:03] but God was rich in Mercy
[1:59:06] to us
[1:59:08] amen God bless you resistance if you'll
[1:59:10] come
[1:59:15] I find no fault
[1:59:17] in him
[1:59:22] God's not looking at you
[1:59:24] the way you look at you
[1:59:27] he's actually looking at himself
[1:59:31] because he picked you
[1:59:36] I know this is so simple but it's so
[1:59:39] profound and so late
[1:59:42] our humanity is so quick to judge
[1:59:46] it's so quick to judge it's so it's so
[1:59:49] phenomenally quick
[1:59:52] while you're standing there let me just
[1:59:54] give you one more story
[1:59:56] it was a Sunday
[2:00:00] and brother Branham couldn't find a
[2:00:02] restaurant open
[2:00:06] Jason he walks into a bar
[2:00:12] that was a restaurant Israel
[2:00:15] there was a policeman
[2:00:18] over there on slot machines
[2:00:21] woman hanging on him
[2:00:23] he looked over the woman there
[2:00:27] there's men talking to her
[2:00:31] brother Brandon said God why don't you
[2:00:33] just wipe this this whole place off of
[2:00:36] the map
[2:00:42] Brotherhood said to Angel the Lord
[2:00:44] pulled him around behind the door
[2:00:48] you know the story well he showed him a
[2:00:51] vision
[2:00:53] Jesus came
[2:00:56] ably like the sins of the world toward
[2:01:00] Calvary
[2:01:01] [Music]
[2:01:03] and he asked him said is that the sins
[2:01:05] of the world
[2:01:06] he said no
[2:01:09] they're your sins
[2:01:24] brother random found himself in a
[2:01:27] completely different place after that
[2:01:28] Vision
[2:01:29] [Music]
[2:01:30] he walked over to that woman
[2:01:35] said I'd like to talk to you she said
[2:01:37] I've gotten somebody with me
[2:01:40] before long you begin to talk to her
[2:01:42] about her life
[2:01:43] oh she'd been a Christian and she got
[2:01:46] away from God
[2:01:48] foreign
[2:01:49] but God had to get him past his
[2:01:52] judgmental spirit
[2:01:54] that he could have Grace for that woman
[2:01:57] and he said in just a little bit we were
[2:01:59] down on our knees praying
[2:02:01] [Music]
[2:02:05] leading her back to God
[2:02:09] I don't know who you'll lead
[2:02:11] to Jesus Christ
[2:02:14] maybe it'll be in a hunting camp
[2:02:16] [Music]
[2:02:18] somebody will see your life
[2:02:21] that's what happened this last week
[2:02:25] I didn't get a deer but I got something
[2:02:27] more precious than a deer
[2:02:31] Souls worth 10 million whirls
[2:02:34] [Music]
[2:02:36] I'd have loved to got that here for you
[2:02:38] 200 inches
[2:02:39] [Music]
[2:02:40] but I got something so much more better
[2:02:43] than a deer
[2:02:47] to know Jesus is worth it all
[2:02:51] maybe you've been running for a long
[2:02:53] time
[2:02:56] and he's rooted over your heart today
[2:02:58] you say Lord touch my life
[2:03:02] Lord touch my judgmental Spirit touch my
[2:03:06] critical attitude
[2:03:09] Lord help me to even get away from this
[2:03:11] self-condemning spirit
[2:03:14] Romans chapter 8 says there is therefore
[2:03:16] now no condemnation to them that are in
[2:03:19] Christ Jesus
[2:03:21] [Music]
[2:03:24] don't waste today don't waste a month
[2:03:26] don't waste a year
[2:03:28] somebody's watching your life you're
[2:03:30] affecting somebody
[2:03:33] your influence is somebody whether
[2:03:35] you're in school or whether you're in
