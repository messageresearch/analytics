happy Mother's Day give the Oklahoma a great big hand you realize what a great day that it is not only in this realm but in another Realm God is having a wife that he can place his seed in her his desire is to spend eternity with you oh how brother Branham would say every day should be Mother's Day and so we wish you a very happy Mother's Day today and I pray that this is a great day for you whether you even if you're not even married may you realize what a Lady of Grace that you are God predestinated us to live and lay out a sea of the darkest age that there would ever be we're in a nation and in a world to where that identity has been so lost until motherhood is not the same as it used to be our our nation has come to the place to where that it's a two people working society and the the motherhood has been lost to where that moms can't stay with children and not going to preach that this morning but but we've lost as America as a world of what true motherhood is but thank God that we have had a message that restored our models and our relationships and what husbands and wives and you can live on a peaceful home I'll let her you a peaceful home to where that we can enjoy one another's company we're going to spend eternity together amen God bless you we've got moms here as as you just sung just a moment ago and I watched you and while being pregnant has not bothered your voice whatsoever amen we so love you sister Bethany with all of our hearts and Isaac too amen so glad to have them with us Brother David and your family thank you guys for coming and and I'd say I'd say brother Wayne's probably your favorite preacher so amen and Ella thank you for coming and being with us we so enjoyed watching you dance last night in the spirit and amen thank God that God has gave you a freedom that you can enjoy that and please take your our love home to your mom and dad one of my favorite preachers is preaching last night and today we became a great friends a long long time ago I would like for you this week if you could go back and at least listen to the last 20 minutes of last night's sermon I have to say that some of the most powerful preaching that I've publicly heard God's trying to tell you who you are and to get you to operate in that Faith to stand in the darkness of laodicea and you know you know sometimes as the week progresses and we get close to a meeting the devil will stir everything that he can stir up so that you will miss the point of what God's trying to do and and you know if you're not careful even you come into a service and you'll sit down and you'll and you'll go through the service and and the enemy will go through your mind and he'll take you in so many directions what he's trying to do is get you to miss what God's trying to tell you because this power power of the spoken word as it begins to deliver to you this is God is projecting through a minister this is what I see you as you may not look at yourself as that but this is the way God is looking at you Abraham you're a father of many nations yet childless I see you as the Bride of Jesus Christ walking on streets of gold spending eternity together in a realm to where there's no time where's no troubles there's no situations and if you can just get to the point to where you believe that you're going to walk there there's not a devil in hell could shake you from that are you with me today I thank brother Wayne for coming and being away from his home and his family and his home church now and then not only that but his own mom and dad and them I I'd like to just say thank you brother Wayne for coming and and uh I want you to grab a halt of what God would like to say to us today maybe in a moment you just say God just clear everything of the last weeks out of the way and let me fall into a channel to where that you can speak to me this morning and Lord lift me just a moment higher I think sometimes when we have speakers in I think sometimes we don't realize how important that is we have that for you we have that for you that you could grab a hold of what God is saying you know we could preach every weekend but I want I want weekends that are special to where that will lift you to another Realm isn't that what you want isn't that what you want Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday and Sunday but once in a while you have Mother's Day to where you look over at your wife and you look at your mom I'm an orphan now Mom and Dad's in another room so I turn all that affection on a beautiful blonde-headed woman yeah she just has to take it we're going to spend eternity together if you just take a moment and just look over at your wife and say I want you to know how much I love you and how much I appreciate you with all my heart did you do that now if you fault this morning to say forgive me now amen brother Ron that's just too mushy it pays off [Music] it pays off God bless you this morning we're certainly looking forward to what God would have to say to us this morning aren't you aren't you and I'm sorry that I took a moment but I wanted to wish you from my heart and to tell you how much I love you with everything that is within me amen don't take it for granted don't take a service ever for granted because it'll never quite be the same ever again amen how many have come hungry today that God would feed our hearts amen God bless you I can't sing like Andrew so I'm going to have him to sing amen God bless you let's stand man are you ready for the word this morning it won't be long [Music] then we'll believe in him [Music] oh it won't be long [Music] to be going home [Music] it won't be long who then will be leaving here oh it won't be long who will be going home who count the years as much oh [Music] and count the monsters we wish oh and count the weeks as days oh any day now and we'll be going home count the years [Music] oh count the years [Music] [Laughter] [Music] day night and we'll be going home [Music] oh it won't be [Music] who then we'll believe oh it won't be long [Music] oh we'll be going home we shall be like him Hallelujah oh we shall be like him oh we

it's certainly good to be in the house of the Lord with you and amen want to say happy Mother's Day to you all and amen it's a it's a great honor a man to be here at Full Gospel Lighthouse and with our buddy Ron and brother Andrew Matt and all the ministering Brothers God bless you all and certainly been a tremendous blessing in our life to be considered a friend with brother Ron and and uh and to know him as a friend and we thank God for it you know true friendships are not bought and but they're actually a gift that God gives you and in preciousness amen and those gifts and we thank the Lord for them and sometimes you know you know how it is it just you know a lot of people but some people you just become special friends with and and we thank the Lord for those kinds of people that's uh in life and we just want to say it's a real honor to be with you and we want to bring you greetings to all and amen I'm just thinking about the loveliness of this day and amen I know we call it Mother's Day amen but how could one day represent such a wonderful thing as mother you know how could how could you put that in one day or one few words there's nothing greater than a mother amen nobody nobody loves you I probably probably don't know I should say this out loud but the other day we was having dinner with some brothers and brother Ron was there was down at brother Sean's meetings and and they were talking somebody said something about me preaching I said well I got brother Ron here tonight somebody's going to enjoy it you know and they kind of laughed at me and I said now as long as I got brother Ron and my mom and they just don't see no wrong in me and I don't I don't I don't know how we did it but we thank God for it amen he could hear me preach when I feel like I flubbed it he'll say oh that was tremendous so thank you brother encouragement amen I want to thank you one appreciate those that are traveling with us this weekend and we want to go into the word of the Lord in the book of Philippians the third chapter the 20th verse amen I I believe that this is a a season that is a special time for the church some things I believe that are so significant to us that the enemy would like us to lose our focus upon it or somehow get our mind on something else but I pray God help us to keep our minds and our Focus on the Promises that have been given to us Amen in Philippians chapter 3 and the 20th verse I want to read this couple verses 20 and 21 then we could be seated now for our conversation isn't heaven from whence also we look for the Savior the Lord Jesus Christ who shall change our vile body that it may be fashioned like it unto his own glorious body according to the working whereby he is able to subdue all things unto himself he is able to subdue all things unto himself amen let's just power hearts Heavenly Father we thank you this morning for the spirit and the grace that you put in our lives now Lord Jesus we're asking you that you would just come this morning with Liberty and father is this wonderful congregation have gathered together today on this Mother's Day I I pray that you would bless them Lord that you would give Grace to their their hearts and their lives and that you would strengthen each one of them Lord now father as we Endeavor to speak your word I pray that Lord that you would bring your mercy bring your grace Upon Our Lives and use this Lord For Your Glory before this people Lord before anyone who would ever hear this we acknowledge we have no abilities and there's nothing good that we have to offer but Lord Jesus if there would be something done we give you all the glory and the honor and praise unto you that you are the matchless Lord Jesus Christ and we thank you Father as we invite you to come now take the platform Lord and use it for your glory we pray in Jesus name amen and amen and God bless you as you can be seated today amen I want to speak to you just a little bit uh today on this Mother's Day and I want to title this the blending of Dimensions the blending of Dimensions uh it's a rather odd sermon for a Mother's Day and I woke up struggling with it this morning and and so I turned on Mother's Day tape about six o'clock this morning and brother Bram said my text today is a rather odd text for Mother's Day and he spoke on the resurrection and I thought isn't that something because that's that's a real Mother's Day right amen that's when the real Mother's Day happens is when the resurrection takes place and amen and brother Bram spoke upon it and and I was sitting there and I was praying saying Lord maybe maybe there's something that you would have me to speak something different and and I got to recollect in a conversation we had yesterday with with Ron there at the table and he was talking about how that when Jesus was out on the sea and he said something came to them and that what they had need of to get through the storm was already on the boat you know and I got to thinking about that that you know what you really have God's already give you amen and I think sometimes if we're not careful we forget how much God has gave us and what the value is of that that has been given amen I I certainly believe that you're in possession of more than you actually realized this morning and knowing that when God Reveals His secrets that those things belong to the church and and the possession that you have and what you're in possession of is much greater than that you would be able to maybe realize amen but I want to just take this today for a little bit and speak upon it and maybe just uh speaking through the scripture here just for a few moments amen but the scripture tells us amen that there would be a change that would come upon the church now I I certainly believe that this is the generation uh that is the generation of rapture now I believe that we've had the prophet of rapture and I believe we've had the child the sound out in the message and we've got the voice living among us so I I really believe that this is the generation that will see the Rapture now I I know that this might sound a little bit fanatical to some people but I really believe that there's people sitting in this building that will change their bodies amen I believe this I believe that it could be this morning I believe that this afternoon I believe in the morning someone could wake up and things be different because I believe we're serving a god of promise and the promise of this age is that God would change our bodies I just love that that there would come a change now in First Corinthians 15 the Bible said this I say Brethren that the flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God and neither doeth corruption inherit incorruption but I will show you a mystery we will not all sleep but we shall all be changed now whether they're living or whether they're sleeping there's everybody's got to be changed everybody has to be changed do you know that the very same thing changes everybody whether someone has passed away and they're sleeping in the dust or whether they're alive the same thing changes both people and that is the Lord himself that's the only way that we can promise change to any life is through the Lord Jesus Christ without change without Christ there is no change there's no change in you there's no change in situations there's no change in life but with him there can be change so when we see that this corruptable shall have put on incorruption and this Mortal shall put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in Victory and oh death where is thy sting and oh grave where is thy Victory now this was coming from a man that was had his head on The Chopping Block amen if if anybody was looking in the face of it he was looking in the face of death and he was literally mocked talking there saying to them where is your victory over me and he was telling that you have no Victory because it has been given to me through our Lord Jesus Christ he was saying to this where is thy sting and where is thy victory in other words what can you do to me when our lord Jesus is already went into the tomb and come back again and he's conquered death hell and the grave and I am a believer now of course we realize that this thought amen that the grave would lose its victory in Job chapter 14 this is where that job himself talks about change and he says if a man shall die shall he live again now all the days of my appointed time will I wait until my change come isn't it something that this this is appropriate as change and job knew that he would go into the ground but he said this he says now thou shall call and I will answer thee and thou will have a desire to work of thine hands that thou will call and I will answer thee now it might be a thought of someone this morning to say you know well job Shirley said you put me in the ground and I'll come again as if he didn't know what happened to a body that went in the ground but this man knew what would take place he actually knew how the grave would consume a human body he said for I know that my redeemer liveth and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the Earth and though after my skin worms destroy the body yet in my flesh shall I see God whom I shall see for myself and mine eyes Shall Behold and not another though my Reigns be consumed within me now this man knew amen that the very thing that was in his body was going to destroy it but the God that he was serving he had already seen the resurrection in its power and knew that God could raise him up again how many realizes that this was not in Prophecy until job spoke this in job 19th Chapter so job was speaking his own Resurrection he was already prophesying that he was going to come out of the grave and he was putting it in resurrection power he was telling them that when God called he was going to answer in Job 14 and verse 15 the Bible says amen of course amen that he would call and he would answer now if you if you break into it a little bit it says this that my dissolved frame shall be United at thy call and the body and soul shall be rejoined together in other words job knew that however long it took God to raise him from the grave he knew that God would be able to put stuff back together again just at his call that just because God said come forth he knew that they could not do anything to him that God could not call him out of the Bible says amen that he would be called and there would come an answer now in restoration Laboratory other animals say this he said though the skin worms destroy my body yet in my flesh shall I see God now regardless of how little we are or how low we are or how impure we are or how Unholy we are or how sick we are or how Afflicted we are the law of God's spirit by his word makes it obey him and it forces the issue it says give it back now now brother Graham said now it forces it regardless of conditions no matter what the condition is the law of God's word forces a condition to cope with his word now the prophet is instilling an idea that whenever you have a word upon something it really doesn't matter whatever it is that the enemy says that this condition is too great that it cannot change here is a prophet saying regardless of the conditions amen God's word has the power to change the condition now that's the that's the reality is that job knew that the word of God stood for that resurrection power that was to come upon him and he no matter what condition he was in when the resurrection came he would have to call now the prophet of God says see what it is it'll be a roll call in heaven he said now if a man shall die shall he live again this is this is job now all the days of my appointed time will I wait till my change come and thou shall call and I will answer thee and thou shall have a desire to work thy hands the great Shepherd is calling his Sheep by name the creative voice of God is calling them from the dust or changing their atoms even if they had not fell asleep it is the rapture amen it is the marriage supper of the Lamb it's a roll call in heaven the creative a voice of God is going to call them from the dust now now that job is absolutely going into the dust but when Christ came he was going to call him out of the dust in a great Resurrection when when Melchizedek come to Abraham I think it's a beautiful story but when Melchizedek came to Abraham what did he bring to Abraham he brought him a message of change now his body said there could be no change to take one look at Abraham and Sarah in that condition they would have said this man speaks like a fool to tell us we're going to have a child in the old age but the one that was speaking to him had already been in the future of Abraham and he was calling a man who had no seed a father knowing that the one that was speaking had the power to change the circumstances that Abraham was in that he was going to change his body now I think it's a powerful thing this morning to realize that the god that we're serving amen he could not fail Our God cannot fail and neither can our God lie now he can do anything but God can't lie so when God said you'll have a son Our God could change Abraham's body but he couldn't lie to Abraham he told Moses to deliver these children and take them in a lamb and God could open a red sea and God confused two million people and God could bless them in their desert Journey but God couldn't lie amen and I don't know what circumstances you you are in this morning but let me say this to you it does not matter how low it doesn't matter how troubled it doesn't matter the condition of your life we are serving a God that has the ability to change the condition to come into the power of his promise I believe today that there's a God Amen who can coat things to make it what did he decide it's going to be amen roll call in heaven now of course when Melchizedek thank you when Melchizedek came unto Abraham he prophesied of his body change and Abraham was changed to fit the very confession that God made over his life now that that was a body change in the days of Abraham it was a resurrection in the days when Melchizedek came and became Jesus Christ but when Melchizedek returns in the end time it will not be just a body change but it will be a body change and a resurrection the creative voice of God that is speaking over this bride amen will have the power to change you in your elements or raise you from the great whichever it finds you in it has the power of change it has the power to replace this body now of course this change we're talking about is a change of garments brother random taught us from the book of Corinthians that Paul said if we know this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have a bill in a house not made with hands and it's Eternal in the heavens for we groan he earnestly Desiring to be clothed upon with a house which is from Heaven it's amazing how the scripture sounds so funny doesn't it that we're going to wear a house you ever think about that we're going to wear a house amen we're going to it's not a house amen it's a body we're not we're not trying to wear a house we're not going to change houses we're going to change bodies amen and Paul is saying this amen that this Earthly house or it's a tabernacle or other people call it a mansion amen and the prophet of God said no it's a body it's a red-headed and blonde-headed and black-headed amen their bodies is what they're talking about amen and the scripture is plain to say that if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one waiting in the eternals and it's already there amen it is an eternal body that you move into if you move out of this place God's got a place for you to move into amen let me just say it like this we are never going to be homeless as the son or daughter of God we're not going to be homeless your mothers that are in the grave this morning are not homeless God only move them out of that old body and put them in a brand new body amen I tell you the first time I met brother Ron amen I met him talked to him a few minutes and I knew his dad already and met his mama amen and when I met him I said oh I actually do knew his dad well I met his mama I said oh there's where Ron came from amen I I saw that character coming right right through so you know this morning amen sister Spencer amen she she's in another body right and that body is a young body how many knows brother bam said is about 20 years old about 22 years old amen that's why naturally the world is trying to go back to that body is that right that's why everybody's trying to be 20 again trying to be 22 again trying to be 25 again and when they can't do it they're surgically doing it right amen they got surgery for everything now it's Amen I better be careful but I I'll just say this amen be careful who you remodel they might leave you he said oh boy I knew one time I shouldn't tell it should I he said oh boy one time amen he remodeled him an old an old he remodeled a old lady and when she got fixed up good she took all that money and went to another man I said boy he should have had a title on that one amen sunk about 60 Grand dinner for her to go find some other old boy listen you can't go back like that amen there's a reason your rear view mirror is smaller than your windshield you are not supposed to live a life looking in a rear view mirror you cannot Look Backwards your whole life amen and try to return back there God don't want you back very wants you what he made you he meant listen to me mother you're a god-sent thing if you're in the place God made you to be in amen listen amen that man amen loves you the way you are you don't have to look back in that rear view mirror and try to go back there and either brother do we need to try to look in that rearview mirror because you ain't never going to look like your son again I promise you you're never going to look like that again you can do what you want to amen but you know when they're 20 years old amen all they got to do is eat a little food and they got muscles on their ears yeah well I'll tell you muscles fall after a while things change amen but you see that thy age at 22 years old man's trying to get back there and they're never going to get back through intellectuals and they're never going to get back through science and they're never going to get back through medications amen but God gave us away amen that we could get back to that body listen I don't know amen if you'll have to bypass the grave or you're going to go through the grave but one thing I know brother amen there's a change coming on the church there's a change coming on our mothers and we're going to go back to that 22 year old body brother let me tell you why amen amen this is I turned 50 in April this is my Jubilee here so I get to dance every service and amen I'm 50 now all my services are Jubilee Services all of my preaching is Jubilee preaching amen because I'm 50. I can do it amen but let me tell you when you give me a 22 year old body amen you think I act up now you wait till you get me in a young somebody in heaven and ain't going nowhere I'm gonna dance for ten thousand years amen all the formal crowds they all want a different part of Heaven you better ask for a different part of Heaven amen because the part I live in is going to be dancing every morning and dancing every evening somebody said well you got that new kind of religion no sir I got the oldest kind of religion there is it's called shouting religion and I think it's time that we shout out some of the formal Devils amen that is raised up in this age like a bunch of Philistines trying to take the blessings of God away from the church well this is one preacher that's not going to shut up and sit down amen I think we ought to put our voice [Applause] yes sir amen I believe it don't you I believe in the grace of God this morning I I believe that Paul said we'll be clothed with a house not a house not a mansion a body a 22 year old body amen a 21 year old body amen but the only way to get there is through the spirit of God isn't that amazing the very thing everybody wants and nobody's willing to get in the place that they'll take them there it's the Fountain of Youth it's the thing that'll do what everybody wants it's the spirit of God Amen as it says amen that we we've be groaning to be clothed upon that the Mortal might be swallowed up in life I love that the Mortal might be swallowed up in life Paul says that II Corinthians 5 amen do you see in First Corinthians 15 the Bible actually speaks of this and it says Death Shall be swallowed up in Victory amen death will be swallowed up in life amen now what's he talking about Paul is talking about amen when the final overthrow of the king of Terrors y'all know who the king of Terrors is don't you it's death king of Tears he he has struck homes he struck lives he struck throughout the ages amen the king of Terror comes when we don't want him the king of terrorists strikes strikes home strikes families he struck our family many times at king king of Terror coming terrorized all of our plans terrorized everything we're going to do but you know I was reading this one day and I I read a I read a little writing on this for this portion it's in the Greek and and it comes up to mean this amen that Paul is using this in a way that says death is no longer Victory amen but he reads it like this that it is a final overthrow of the king of Terrors can you imagine when the king of tires is completely overthrown when there is no more death when there is no more separation listen what you are under this morning is the only thing that will destroy the king of Terror and take his powers away from the church this is the greatest almost ever given to a Believer he will swallow up death and victory and the Lord God shall wipe away our tears from off of our faces and the rebuke of this people shall be taken away from off of the Earth for the Lord has spoken it for the Lord has spoken him Hosea 13 and 14 can you pull that up man I'll tell you what to be honest this is this this little scripture right here has probably been one of my favorite scriptures I've read in a long time in Hosea 13 and 14 amen he says I will Ransom them from the power of the grave and I will redeem them from Death now he speaks to death and says oh death I will be thy plagues and oh grave I will be thy destruction repentance shall be hid from mine eyes I thought oh mercy listen this amen all kinds of plagues have come upon man there's been the Bubonic plague there's been the smallpox plague there's been the amen chickenpox and the fevers and the influenzas and the Cove heads and man has suffered of all kinds of plagues but God is looking at death and he said I'm going to be your plague can you imagine when death heard the almighty Eternal Immortal God said I'm gonna plague you death and you will never be able to repent from my side amen there shall never be a place where death can hide from The Immortal God death amen will be destroyed by the presence of the Living God oh death I am thy plague my goodness every little bit I just get up morning and read that to the devil I just get up and read it to the devil somebody says to me so what do you do that for because he's always reminded me of my past so I'd like to remind him of his future I just like the devil to know the same one that called Abraham father when he was fatherless is the same one that's taken this king of Terror who thinks he's in the prime of his kingship and I'm looking right down the road and I say Satan I see your end coming amen I see that you had a beginning and I see that you got it in and everything that you've ever done to my family every hurt that you've ever put upon the Church of the Living God we are going to throw him in the Lake of Fire the Bible said that we will throw him in the Lake of Fire all hell hates that but Satan and his angels will be completely annihilated there is an end to this devil amen this change that I'm talking about is a Deliverance in Hebrews chapter 2 and 15 it said and they will deliver them who through the fear of death were a lifetime subject to bondage Paul in 7 23 in Romans he said I see another law and my members warned against the law in my mind bringing into captivity the law of sin which is in my members all wretched man that I am who shall deliver me from this body of death I thank God through Jesus Christ Our Lord so then that the mind I serve the law of God but with the law of Flesh the law of sin but with the flesh the law of sin listen this man o Wretched Man that I am we don't have time to preach that but but you you you I don't need to explain that to anybody born of a woman because job said a man born of a woman is a few days and full of trouble he's a few days and full of trouble trouble everywhere that a man is born trouble everywhere amen somebody said well I tell you what I got saved so I'm perfect well amen I want you to stand up and let us all admire a perfect person because that's what we'd like to do we'd like to see one we'd like to see somebody perfect like won't you go ahead amen I think we just love it we put it on camera we'll tell the world there's a perfect person right there well ain't nobody stand up y'all must be like me this is Apostle Paul oh Wretched Man that I he's calling himself wretched Jacobs and I'm not a worm these men understood their littleness as a human being they understood amen the need for God and the need for the blood and the need for the atonement listen the next time you go to pile on somebody and really get after them I want you to stop and think about your need next time you really go to get somebody I want you to stop and think about your need and think about what you would be without the blood think about what you would be without Christ what would you be without Grace come on you hey man uh I'll say this to you Grace is what God gave you with favor you didn't ask for it but Mercy is what God didn't give you you deserve hey man I tell you what now some of you hey man you probably Drive exactly speed limit but some of you but I gave plug years hey man some of you probably don't probably maybe didn't drive exactly speed limit all your life amen but you didn't get a ticket for that did you that's called mercy God lets you I'm nailed and if I got a very old referral amen and and amen amen and God she probably told you to slow down too didn't you amen amen and you know see what it is it's God Amen gives you Mercy but did you see somebody else and want to give them a ticket you want to put it on them amen why not extend the mercy that God has given to you amen David said amen the mercies of God Amen they're new every morning my goodness what we would if we got what we deserved it'd be death hell in the grave but God who is rich in Mercy didn't give us what we deserve but he gave us Grace and he revealed the message of the hour to us and sent us in this building this morning believing God and knowing god and trusting God Amen I tell you thank God for his Mercy this morning Hallelujah some hours say hallelujah praise be to our God who gives us Mercy who shall deliver this body of death now Paul knew it Paul knew he needed deliverance from this Wretched Man and he had no he had no justification for it he had no way to say what it was he knew he needed it but he said I thank God through our Jesus Christ the mind I serve myself serve the law of God but with the law of Flesh the law of sin but now there is now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of Life somebody shout the law of Life the law of the spirit of Life do you see amen there it is brother random in restoration the Bright Tree saying when the word is spoken there's a law that goes with that word and that's the law of life when he said Abraham thou are the father that was the law behind that word it's the law of life it could take an old man and make him young again it was a long life a superseded the wrinkles in his body the gray hair in his hand and gave him back youth because the law of life was at work I know the law of gravity is working on your arms and your legs and your hair and your life and the law of gravity is at work amen I don't know of a better example I wish I had a better one but I don't know of a better one than the law of gravity working Amen to keep you on the ground but the law of aerodynamics has worked to put you in the air anybody ever wrote a Jet Plane knows the laws there's two laws and they exist at the same time but the law of aerodynamics gives you the power to supersede the other law it doesn't do away with it it gives you something that supersedes it amen and you're sitting here saying I'm yet in the human body but I'm saying there's another law I know you're getting older but there's another law I know your life looks like it's ending but there's another law it's the law of life amen that God will change our body and this law that is working on the inside of us there is no condition that can stop it amen there's not enough devils in hell that can arrest and put back the law of almighty God his word has spoken it and so shall it come to pass because there is a law there is a law and that is a law that supersedes all other laws isn't that powerful the law of God how it supersedes it Amen to bring it forces hey man y'all know what the law of life is don't you brother man said here's the law of life I already done it he said there was two laws in Deuteronomy he said watch that out there on Mount Sinai there's your law of death he said but watch Mount Calvary there's your law of life I have already blessed thee Abraham I have already did it Abraham I'm going to call you a father and you ain't a father yet but I've already done it I've already provided the way to do it it's already coming you you see what he's doing he's showing you there is laws that is existing on the inside of you right now listen what you need for a Rapture is not coming what you need for a Rapture amen what Apostle Peter needed to survive the storm was already on the boat what Rahab needed Amen to get out of Jericho was in the house the tenth coin was laying in the floor she just had to find it and what you need is already in you if you have the Holy Ghost everything you need for a Rapture is already on the inside of you you don't need you don't need you need to realize what God has already invested in the church he's already put it in it and it's in a law when God gave you the word the law of God can work on that word the law amen it's a law and it has been amen it has been put against the sentence of death that works in you so there's a sentence against you because of the word of God but there's another law and it's the law of Mount Calvary the law of life now Paul says this in second Corinthians chapter 1 verse 9. I think it's powerful he said but we had the sentence of death within ourselves that we should not trust in ourselves now there's not enough time to preach these scriptures but I'll read them to you we cannot trust within ourselves do you see you hear this Paul don't trust yourself for this change don't trust in yourself don't trust in yourself because in God is he that raiseth the Dead now who delivered us from so great at death and doeth deliverer in whom we trust that he will deliver us so Paul is calling this a great Deliverance in first Thessalonians chapter 1 and verse 10 he said and to wait for the son from Heaven whom raised the dead even Jesus which delivered us from the Wrath which is to come isn't that amazing he delivered us from death our God is a great deliverer and he has delivered us from it now our lord Jesus according to First Timothy 6 and verse 15 he said he will show himself alive he says which in times he shall show who is the blessed and only potentate the King of Kings and the Lord of lords who only hath immortality dwelling in light which no man can approach unto which no man has seen nor can see and whom we honor and power Everlasting amen now look Paul is saying God's going to show who it is that has this power amen God is going to show this now that's why I said what do you mean show he's going to reveal this power to a generation how many knows what generation will see it according to Luke 17 30 there will come a day of the revealing of the son of man which will be done under the Malachi 4 Ministry which is the eagle revealing the great power that God has exhibited into this age whatever God reveals belongs to the church whatever God opens belongs to the church and he's going to show who is the Blessed potentate he's going to show who is the king of all Kings who is the Lord of all Lords who has immortality and power can you imagine brother Adam standing on the platform in front of thousands and thousands and thousands of people and saying I take every spirit under my control I'm a brother he said preacher what is that I tell you what the kingdom of God has come nigh unto thee when one man could subdue an entire realm of spirits now you said preacher why would you put that because God was revealing God was revealing something to the church he was telling you that by faith they subdue kingdoms by faith they done these things the message has given Faith to a Believer listen I don't know what kind of circumstances you're in but let me assure you something you can subdue that circumstance the same way that a prophet subdue he said preacher amen I don't know how to do it and and brother random himself didn't even know he had it in him at times until he until he crosses the fence and runs out across the field and here comes a killer Bull and when that bull got into the atmosphere of that Prophet it laid down under the tree because he had What it Took already in him and the church already has what it takes on the inside of them you just don't know yet what really is on the inside of you until it's pressed my goodness I feel something in the building I might as well go ahead and preach it listen you you you are looking at the situation like it's come to destroy you and it's come to prove you it's not come to take you it's come to make you shine in A Realm of Darkness and to show this world to show this world exactly a believer in how they approach a trial my goodness when I think about this I think about the pressing of an individual to show that God is showing God is showing this for a purpose in Colossians chapter 3 and verse 4 he said when Christ who is our life shall appear then shall we also appear with him in glory when Christ is now if you're not careful you put that out to the physical Return of the Lord Jesus in his own physical body amen but listen I don't know if you know this but we need the glory of God today we need the glory of God today somebody said what's his glory brother man said signs Miracles and wonders remember that when Moses said God said to him go down there and deliver them people Moses said wait a minute I've already tried that but when Christ who is his life appeared in that bush Hebrews 11 says that he suffered the reproach of Christ it was Christ that appeared to Moses in that bush and it lit the fire on the inside of the man who had tried to do something intellectually but when God spoke to him he went down there as a one-man Army and subdued the entire nation because God had revealed to him as Glory you say how did God do it I tell you what he said to him he said what's that in your hand Moses and Moses throw down the rod and picked it up put his hand in his vest and pulled it out and he saw the supernatural workings of An Almighty God and let me say this just because other people impersonated it don't make it fake brother just because other people put on it don't make it fake when God gives something to a church or to a people I don't care how many false prophets and how many first impersonators that rise up it's still true anyhow he said preacher why would you say it because I heard brother man say it on tape this morning he said that's exactly what happened with shamgar's day he said just about the time they had a good Revival he said some outfits rose up among them and he said started out with every kind of fanaticism he said which tried to kill the Revival he said but as Shankar didn't put up with it he took what he had in his hand and beat down those emotional ideas until he had a liberty that he could keep the Revival God had sent him hey man I know what I'm talking about every time God really starts moving Among Us amen somebody takes off into a certain realm he was well that's an impersonation and that's an impersonation and it takes away the glory of God that he is performing Among Us and putting in our churches amen so every devil Out of Hell raises up and tries to say this and tries to say that well I say it's time pick up your Oxnard and put that devil back in his place I think it's time to quit lending ears to devils and taking attacks against Good Men of God and put that devil right back in his place and say Satan you're not welcome in the house of God Amen my ears are not trash cans you you said preacher I don't have time to go get no training I don't have time to go figure out how to defeat this devil I tell you how you do it you don't have to leave this meeting you take the word of God that's in you right now and begin to fight against that devil and say Satan you're not taking another service you're not taking another Revival you're not taking another meeting from me this is my morning this is a morning for my children this is a morning for our family I'm gonna beat down every devil until I see the presence of God until the fire of God drops in my I think it's time to fight your way out I know the devil's tried to harness you up I know he's trying to put you in a place that you can't explain I say it's time to kick loose [Music] mother bam said that was a problem with people today he said they take fired up preachers and put them through their theological seminaries until they take all the preacher out of them and he said they harness them down in theology brother man said they've been a lot better off without the Theology and went and preached why there was some fire in their heart amen you said what are they going to preach another man said if you ain't got nothing else tell them how your candle got lit and say what would that do because somebody looking for change you can tell them I can't explain it but I was this way and the spirit of God coming I'm this way now I'd like to see that in scripture okay look over there when Elijah was setting it to Brookshire and the Ravens brought him fish or brought him meat and brought him brought him food brother man said he said where did it come from he said the critics of where did it come from he said he said Elijah didn't ask he just ate it and they said brother random word of the Holy Ghost come from brother man said I don't know I just eat it he said God brings it and I just eat it amen I'm not going to question God but when the Holy Ghost comes I'm going to feed upon the spirit of God until every demon is pushed back and the liberty of God and the faith of God can come upon it when Christ who is our last shall appear they will come a power in the church to subdue every devil to subdue every problem to subdue every issue Devil's popping up like Pop-Tarts y'all know it's the truth that's the best way to say it ain't they come out of nowhere [Applause] you think everything's going okay but the devil been cooking up something for a while and all of a sudden it pops up well I'm gonna tell you something brother bam said that's what happened to Moses he said when that when that Philistine Army showed up at the Red Banks he said it was showed up overnight he said and it was a mushroom and he said anything shows up that fast Gonna Leave fast too it's a preacher all of a sudden you just don't know how to handle it let me tell you just stand still a minute and watch the god of Abraham handle it watch how God how God is a God of War he's a god of battle if you'll hold your peace and just keep believing this word the god of Abraham will send all the wrongs right and bring life back where it belongs because he's still God he shall appear and when he does he will subdue it all do you know that you had the message right now to whip any devil anywhere any place any time in any form it comes so how am I going to do that the prophet said the word was the weapon of the spirit you've been given a word for the season you're living in in other words what you need to whip the devil God's already gave it to you now it's amazing because what we see in the scripture is Paul said that the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there's liberty Now isn't it amazing that Paul calls the Lord a spirit you all know why he'd do that don't you because over there in the book of Acts when he was yet unconverted and he was fighting the church he met that light and he said I am Jesus whom thou persecutes he knew that the capital Ella or D was a spirit when Paul saw him in that light that's the same light that returns to the church and Paul says when Christ who is our life shall appear isn't that amazing when he comes among us we'll be like him and share in his glory because he's revealing who he is revealing what he does and Under that Revelation see the Lord is that Spirit where the spirit Lord is there is Liberty now in first Thessalonians 4 I'm just going to give this for the scripture so to back the point for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout the Lord himself the Lord is that spirit right the Lord is the the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with Liberty to look Beyond the Veil see nobody saw what you're seeing as long as it's a secret it's hid when it's revealed it belongs nobody has come into the possession that this bride has come into see a man does not unveil himself in the public it's only before his bride he does that in Revelation that's why the scripture said the Lord himself should descend from heaven but the world won't see this and Jesus said they wouldn't he said yet a little while the world seeth me no more so just because somebody else can't see it don't mean it ain't happening it's actually a promise they won't see it don't get mad at them if God didn't give you the Liberty you wouldn't see it but because God who is rich in Mercy has sent forth the spirit of his son not giving you the spirit of fear but the spirit of adoption causing you to have Liberty to come into the presence of God and see things that Kings have longed to see and hear things that angels have not heard amen but we are now the amen the adopted manifested sons of the Living God Amen not because of who we are but because of what God is revealed to us he has set us in a station or a position of Life a position of authority he has gave us the secrets of his kingdom the secrets of the Warfare the secrets of exposing the devil he has revealed to us how to defeat this devil always now I know the devil would like us to forget that but I'm not going to now notice in second Corinthians chapter 3 and verse 8 watch 18 watch Paul say it with an open face an unveiled face beholding as in the glass the glory of the Lord isn't that amazing it doesn't just say to behold beholding so it's not just one look at it it's a continual look and Satan will constantly try to get you to look just look off you remember you remember the prophet taught on the serpent Charming the bird y'all remember that and Brother Band said how is it that that serpent can get the bird out of the air he said he paralyzes him with the hypnotism of stare and he said if that bird ever looks in the eyes of the serpent he said he charms him and pulls him right into his mouth teaching us what you look at is the way you go you start looking at problems there you go you start looking at issues there you go hey man one one I got hurt as a young man in a wreck with a buddy of mine he bought a brand new truck I mean it was brand new he's going fishing it's about six in the morning that's about half time we stayed up two o'clock morning get up six go fishing that's only guys will do that never for work but for fishing sleep just two hours gotta go fishing you know we get up the next morning we're driving down the highway it's only about 40 mile an hour so I'm gonna drive down through there and he's looking for something and it's behind me behind my seat in the king cab and he reaches over behind me and he can't feel it so he just looks next thing I know I wake up in the dash we hit a Tom's truck on the side of the road things setting dead still but the minute he looked this way he just pulled the steering wheel that way and we crashed right into it hey man what no fault of mine but the guy driving got to look in the wrong direction amen and if you look a certain way that's the way you're going amen so that's why Paul said keep your eyes beholding him amen and it will change you into the same image can you imagine amen that if you keep watching God you start moving toward God you're beholding him and it is changing you now watch what he said let not your heart be troubled you believed in God believe also in me that in my father's house are many mansions and if it were not so I would have told you I'd go to prepare a place and if I go to prepare a place I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there you shall be also isn't that beautiful you said preacher how's he going to do it he meant he's sending a message to receive you what you have received of the Lord is his reception power to take you into the rapture it's a it's it's a it's a best way I know how to say it is this is what the way God reaches down to take the church is by the word now it's to make its claim on you this word is made a claim on your life how many remembers when they first heard the message all them things you were doing and it just changed it just changed circumstance it changed relationships things that you had planned things things you're going to do amen church and things and ideas and all of a sudden God began to reveal this to you and it literally claimed your life it's amazing thing when you feel the claim of God come on you when you feel that God says you're mine that's a powerful feeling you belong to me and you're sitting there arguing now God see there's this and and there's this and and there's this and you know after all there's this and then you start trying to give all these excuses and then you start reading the message of the hour and you see the very man he called to deliver the message when the angel came to him he's carrying water to a moonshine Steel he's got the water to illegal alcohol in his hand when God comes to him he's not going to the altar he's not working at the church he's not preaching the angel came to him because he was predestinated of God to carry this message and he wanted him to know don't you drink or smoke or defile your body because you belong to me and I'm going to do this with your life and when God claimed brother random he claimed him without excuse amen he could offer nothing that God would accept amen you know what that's telling me it's telling me I don't care what your parents are I don't care what your church was like I don't care what your childhood was like listen I don't want to hear how you was a mess in your teenage years or what you did or didn't do amen I tell you what I want to hear amen yes Lord yes Lord yes Lord because the god of Abraham claims a church and when he claims that bride every problem you have every situation every insecurity all of your Humanity all of your complexes he blames you because he predestinated you and you can run if you want to but you'll never outrun the presence of the Living God David said though I make my bed in hell he'll find me there Jonah went into the belly of the well and God found him there and he found you maybe on a bar stool maybe he found you in a church maybe he found you on the street but the God who is rich in Mercy said I will have a bride and he claimed you for it when God begins to reach you know what he does amen he claims you for this message you know this message is claiming you for a rapture God didn't disclaim you he claims you for a change he claims you to exhibit his power over death it's amazing in Hebrews 9 he said them who often have suffered since the foundation of the world but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself and it is unappointed unto men wants to die but after that the Judgment so Christ was offered to Bear the sins of many and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation you said preacher what are you saying I'm saying God just called in and broke all of your appointments I'm saying that God called in and broke all the appointments you have you got plans you got situations you got things you're going to do and God has said no you have been claimed for my portion of this word in this generation do you see God breaks appointments for you and you you can plan amen the plans of men is so easy isn't it you can plan everything out how you're going to do it how it's going to be and then somebody else annoying to you breaks the whole thing takes one little individual amen we had plans amen and that little unborn baby amen and Zach's have another child and that's why Chris is not with us it's actually a premature labor is trying to come on so she had the rest of Chris and stayed home take care of her amen God bless Chris she's a real mother she she's a she's a Dandy amen God give us a Grace when he gave us that lady and you know as as a mother but watch that little child broke all of our plans that's coming next week amen it's so easy for somebody else to break your plans but the man that's breaking your plans with death is the almighty God he has said Death Shall be disannulled and your agreement with hell shall not stand I don't care if you've carried that agreement in your life your whole life death has rained your whole life death has since you belong to him but the god of mercy and of life has said I didn't say no your agreement that you made with hell you belong to me oh I remember when the sentence of death was broken over my life and the law of life began to be moved on the inside of me that's when the grace of God begin to deal with our hearts now the prophet of God tells us this he tells us that God is going to have awakened time for the people that sleep in the do you know the people that have went on we'll just take a few of them brother Frazier uh that used to be your pastor sister Connie's dad do you know that he's now I hope y'all don't get bothered at me but you all know that he's not a million miles from the meeting this morning if you want to get down to it brother Brown said the only thing separate you from seeing him is the veil of the flesh so the the living Saints who have went beyond the Veil are right Among Us now I know we get to thinking that there's someone who's way off and Heaven is way off but your thought is way wrong Heaven is not a million miles from here this is the prophet of God said there'll come a time they'll be awaking and he said those that are asleep in the decibel he said they'll begin to they'll begin to rise he said some won't wake up for another thousand years he says some of those corruptable bodies were put on incorruption and in the rapturing grace of the Lord we'll be caught up together when they begin to get together then we which are alive and remain shall be changed these mortal bodies will not see death but just of a sudden there will be a sweep over us and we'll be changed turned back like Abraham from an old man to a young woman from an old woman to a young woman there's a sudden change and after a while you'll be traveling like a thought and you'll see those who are already resurrected just before Abraham's changed somebody called him a father the same one that spoke to Abraham is speaking these quotes to you the message of the hour came from the same source that stood at the tent door of Abraham and spoke to him and said thou are the father of Nations and when he prophesied over him the chains followed behind it the same one has prophesied over this bride there is a change Upon Us amen the spoken word has already been spoken over you I don't know the condition but I know the god that spoke it your body seems to maybe and it's not complying but let me promise you this if it's not today it'll be tomorrow if it's not tomorrow it'll be the next day and if it's not the next day it'll be the next day one thing that I'm certain of there is a change coming upon the Church of the Living God God has spoken it and nothing can change what God has spoken our bodies will change that word is not going to change brother Bram said them that are dead in Christ shall rise first and appear to many and all at once you'll see something begins to stand there and look at you and there's a brother and you know it ain't long in a few minutes we'll be changed now if you're if you're studying the message and I won't go deep in this but I'll just say this very clearly if you're studying the message you're going to find brother Brown say two certain things about the change he'll say some people are alive he says and they'll look over and they'll see the resurrected Saint and it'll change them in the other quotes he'll say you're going to be standing there something's going to sweep over you you're going to change and then you will see the resurrected Saints and somebody said brother Wayne which is it listen as long as you're changed as long as you're changed do you see what the devil would do is get us arguing over that point and get your mind off of a promise you're going to be changed amen you just got given a new Corvette who cares if it was Pennzoil or I ain't going to take it it's got pins all in it do you see what it is we'll be changed in the moment of a twinkling of an eye and we'll be together with them and then go missing on the earth now there's a beautiful scripture here in Matthew 27 the grace were open to many bodies of saints with slope arose and they come out of the Graze and after the resurrection when the holy city and appeared unto many and appeared unto many now of course this is where brother Branham draws this thought in letting off a pressure brother bam said next thing there will be a sweep and a little group will get together in a month or so she'll be gone and she's gathered together we're at the end in Acts chapter 1 and verse 3 the Bible said being seen of them forty days so you hear people say well it'll be 30 or 40 days now some people thinks that's preaching return Ministry well if you think Wayne rosson believes in return minutes to you have lost your mind I'm saying that is as open as I know how because I think it's a horrid teaching the only way I believe return Ministry I'm gonna tell you how I believe it I believe that William Branham went out west and met the angels of the Lord and the Lord said to him go back east and preach the Seven Seals he returned and preached the Seven Seals so what you have for Rapture what you need for Rapture is already here now the prophet of God said some of them will be sitting at a table one of these mornings he said one of them be taking the other left amen what is it brother bran begins to talk about you'll be standing there feeling the change and the wrinkles will fall away and they'll be changed in the moment of die say preacher what are you talking about I'm talking about some of you have mothers that you could go home and be cooking your beans tonight and look over and see one of them stand in your kitchen now this is almost shocking but you know that we're living in such a season we're able to look up brother Frazier come walking down the aisle we're living in such a season Charlie Spencer might come into somebody said well brother Wayne you're crazy I'm not crazy amen the times that we're living amen the dimensions themselves are blending so much that God had a prophet stand on the earth and tell you exactly what was happening in another dimension he wasn't leaving the building when he began to say over your head is a lie and you did this and you said that and this was over here and he said there's a woman hooded for death and there's this and what was he doing he was standing on the platform never left the building showing you that God and the devils and the angels and everything is right here in the building where you're sitting here this morning amen everything is going on right around you listen this is the very thing amen we're going to meet one another brother bam says it like this in the Paradox one of the greatest uh little quotes he said oh what a worship time it'll be he says we're going to get together you know he said that he said the reason being if you got loved ones that's went on he said you're going to say did they make it and he said you're going to meet them before you meet Jesus so as to get all that out of the way because when a man goes to meet Jesus amen the only thing that will be on our mind is the nail scarred hands of our Lord Jesus Christ the nail scarred feet of our Lord Jesus Christ the only thing that's on our mind is worshiping him amen throughout eternity that saved our soul gave us a Grace gave us the blessings of God Amen you see it's got to be all out of the way so we could turn our attention and focus upon our Lord Jesus Christ because it's the Rapture of the church now I know it would be easy for us to say one of these days this is going to happen one of these days these things are going to take place but do you know you're living in a moment right now where you are bumping into another dimension while you're sitting in the building this morning do you recognize there's another dimension that is running right current with this church this morning and once in a while you bump into that Dimension you bump into that anointing when brother Branham describes it amen I'm not going to read it I'll just preach it but when brother random describes it he says what is happening he says is the angels of the Lord have encamped about this building and they're creating the atmosphere that you are feeling he said that's why when you come in here you feel different than you did amen because you've come into the atmosphere of it and that atmosphere is the atmosphere at one of these mornings you're going to step into that atmosphere and it's not just going to heal you amen your body of cancer or Your Eyes Upon Us it's going to change you from the top of your head to the bottom of your feet it's an atmosphere of the Holy Ghost amen I don't know about y'all amen but I don't want no intellectual formal atmosphere I want to live in the place where angels are created eating and staring and moving and the power of God is sweeping back and forth [Applause] amen there's a ton of quotes brother Adam said we are living when time is blending into eternity again and again he says it we're living when time is Blended into eternity we are living where time Blends into eternity and he says listen that realm is not a Million Miles Away hey man you've heard brother bam say it he said how is it then that that angel cannot be here and in one second he's here he said if he was coming from out in the heaven somewhere he said some of those places are a million light years amen how many Earth years would it take for him to get here he had to start over there a hundred years ago to get here this morning but he appears and disappears and moves right through the church amen all this that you said preacher what are you saying I'm saying that's why amen that things can change so quickly you could be sitting here thinking well I'm not getting much or this ain't going to be a good day or this situation and all of a sudden one word it turns up you're inside amen turns your world over and all of a sudden you're setting in a revelation that God is dealing with you because it's a sudden change and the change of the body will come from that same atmosphere I'll tell you what when you start studying this and you see when you start seeing that this atmosphere begins to blend into this realm these Dimensions begin to bump together and it starts moving brother Brandon will tell it like this he'll say it's angels in the room now now I know we're coming under an extreme amount of criticism for worship yeah an extreme amount of criticism for worship and I'll tell you why it's because men don't understand the atmosphere they just don't understand if they did they wouldn't criticize it because they would know that's what it takes for birth that's what it takes to bring life that's what it takes to break Spirits that's what it that's what it takes is an atmosphere from the spirit of God that creates those things now watch this because brother random begins to tell us this amen that these things are present right now in this building right now now if they're present here right now we need something to open to reveal to us so that we can possess what actually is in the room how many opportunities have we left lane how many how many times have we been in the service when the spirit of God and we miss that we miss that opportunity let me tell you let me tell you what happens the spirit of God to be moving now and uh maybe maybe if you're new or you're visiting or maybe if you're trying to impress people or being a party I remember when I was young went into a meet one time and man I was you know all these people and I I just don't heal Billy and I felt pretty embarrassed around all of them and especially if they ever figured out how I worshiped that's a crazy man I just sit in a meeting spirit of God goes by you know and I feel it boy man you just want to get up and shout you know and I just sat on it and the guy behind me goes to screaming and you knew right then that you missed the presence and let somebody else get it because you was just a little embarrassed or you would just look amen and it passed right over you see somebody then somebody says to you they said well what what does that what does that have to do with it that's just emotion but see there's an unseen Force creating that now if you were a Seer as brother Branham was brother Branham in the message God in Simplicity it's in Albuquerque the end of the meeting whether Ram is teaching on how to receive the Holy Ghost most of his sermons he closes in prayer lines in this one he's telling you how to receive the Holy Ghost about a 30-minute section and in the middle of that section hey man you'll hear him say there it is and people are going screaming I mean the power's dropping you can hear the congregation and he'll go there it is and then he'll turn around the demon shakarian and he'll watch a little woman and he'll watch her throw her hands up and brother bam you can hear him slightly on tape and he'll say demons did you see it did you see it and he says now I tried to point it to other demons just a moment ago that Pillar of Fire just came over this little girl right here and she throwed her hands up now say sometimes when you see that happen you see a little girl throw up her hands you'll say well is that real you know and the prophet of God said he she throwed up her hands because that pillar of light went over her now do you see what shamgar's got to fight because you're going to look at somebody else throw up their hands and you're going to see a hypocrite do it sometime and you're going to say well there's nothing in behind it and that's a devil of impersonation trying to rob you from the reality of what is really happening Satan is always trying to steal from the church listen I want to thank God for our young people in this generation amen I thank God for our generation that's coming up amen that learns how to worship and I I just want to give you thanks to some of you old Eagles teaching these young Eagles how to fly because that's sometimes really what they need they need to see Mama get up and shout and dance and I know people don't like that but it's true anyhow they need to see you shout The Pride off a little bit and Shout you remember people who shot the hairpins out I've seen them either I've seen them leave their shoes under the Altar and just shout back and forth how their hair fell down and the pins were laying on the floor amen my old grandma used to get to shout and she would she'd bounce up against a hot a hot wood stove and it would never burn her it wasn't something false it was reality amen but God showed it to me as a young child and I saw the reality and I saw the power of God and let me tell you this amen I got away from it but one day God got to calling me back to it and listen I remember my Heritage I remember the shouting people I come from the power of God that would flow to their lives and sometimes that's what our young people need to see they don't need to see just a perfect person living a perfect life but they need to see parents and mothers and have done wrong or said wrong and say honey I was wrong I'm sorry but I ain't gonna stay under this guilt my whole life I'm gonna say I'm sorry and then I'm gonna shout and I'm gonna dance and I'm going to praise God because I'm under the blood [Applause] man ain't nobody perfect but the blood covers the heart of a man if he ever says God I'm sorry those Dimensions try to come together they're coming together on you you are the place that God is breaking out in this generation amen we got we got sister Ella with us tonight this morning God bless sister Ella amen she sits on my my left at home she's she's one of my spiritual cheerleaders amen if things get a little tough I just look at Ella she's right with me come on preach it by the way preach it by the way I don't know what the rest of them's doing but I come to have church I pray that everybody that comes to the house of God comes in the spirit of Hell come and put your hands up and say I don't have no problems I'm not seeing no problem I'm just looking to worship God and praise God and get the Revival in my life until the Holy Ghost can move in every heart you all know I'm telling you the truth It's Shouting Time Amen in the Church of the Living God the message of the hours receive the message of change oh if we were looking for something maybe one thing but when you realize what you're in possession of and what God has revealed to you he's showing you that that other dimension is right here in this dimension somebody said well I tell you why amen I I I don't understand how it's not here and not somewhere else this is just a building folks that's all this is it's just a building this is only a building that somebody put up here amen but what makes it become the atmosphere is every one of you are creators and when you come into the house of God and you begin to let everything else go amen I told I told our church I'll brag on True Word the other day I said I'll tell you what I found out this brother Matt no matter what that church is going through they're ready to have church it don't matter I've seen them lay off we went through some great struggles we lost Rachel and Charlie amen we've lost other people sudden deaths and tragedies and situations they were ready to have church and you know I found the kindred spirit right here at Full Gospel Lighthouse I found that this this place that you know how to set aside the problems to have church let the atmosphere of God come upon amen listen our young people does not need to inherit the problems of other Generations we do not need to set them down and tell them all the problems we don't need to some of you have told your children things they should have never knew and they never would have knew it had you not told them I think it's time to quit telling tales and start telling promises and telling the word of God start telling the positive things it's a changing time amen I don't have time to cover all the problems and all the situations my dad one time had an old boy help me with a boat but brother Rona had her boy helped me a boat and I liked the guy he was a nice guy the older man I went home told my dad about it and dad said to me he said son he said now that guy he said he was in the Masons with your grandpa and he said he done him dirty on he didn't even die he done him dirty on a car deal I'll tell you why I got me an attitude right then my grandpa been dead I was three-year-old when he died I got me an attitude right then I wouldn't even go back down to that guy's place I didn't have him hey I needed him I didn't have him do anything else for me I wouldn't even drive down his driveway no more and one day I was talking to Dad he said what'd you say that guy's name was and I told him again he said no that's the wrong guy he said it was that other guy and I was so offended for my dead grandpa I didn't even want to talk to that man listen amen don't get offended for other people's problems and whatever somebody else done to somebody else I tell you it's time to set aside every situation and get ready for the change get ready for the change get ready for the atmosphere of God to break out in the church you got what you already need and you can create an atmosphere right here in this building amen we're dead Limbs and come back upon lies and hearts begin to change listen I tell you you can create it I promise you can create it he said preacher I tell you what at my house is pretty bad do you know you can build it all the stories you read brother bam telling Aaron's Rod how many ever heard it he talks about an old stick taken off of a tree and taken into the atmosphere of the holies of holies and it budded overnight do you know that atmosphere that budded that stick brother Brown said it represented Humanity in the presence of God he said you come off of The Stick of humanity and you were dried up and dead but when you come in the presence of God it brought life again that place that Moses took the Stick of Aaron into he built it he built it all that Supernatural with a pillar of fire and the light Moses built that place and he built it so that God could meet with man and that same atmosphere is still available in the house of God not because of the church but because the people build the atmosphere where God comes in and deals with man now I don't know of a better story in the Bible to give this example I'm out of time so I'm just going to preach to you here and close but I'll tell you this I don't know of a better example in story in the Bible than jerivus daughter I don't know of a better example in story When jariris sin after the Lord he went and got him and said come to my house right come to my house and Jesus said I'll come now he's coming just like he promised Through the Ages I'm coming but but geriver's daughter died before he ever got there right and and somebody come and said don't bother the master she's already dead and he said the woman she's not dead the girl's not dead she sleeps he started breaking out revelation and the Bible tells us amen that when he got down to the house you know what when he announced that she was sleeping she wasn't dead the Bible said they scorned him they laughed at him for his revelation of Supernatural atmosphere and that they really were alive do you know what he did with them look what he done the brother Bradley brings this in in the healing drivers his daughter and then later proven his word when brother Brown brings it out he says look what he did he took out the skeptic and the make-believer and the unbeliever the Bible says he took them out of the room and you know what he did he took in Peter James and John brother bam said he took in the room faith hope and charity he exchanged critics and unbelievers amen and make Believers and he put in the room amen James John and Peter hope faith charity and brothers said anywhere that you can take in charity hope and love Faith charity and hope he said where you can take them in what he done is he changed the atmosphere in gerivers's house he changed the atmosphere in jeriver's house and it comes he said preacher what are you talking about I'm talking about William Branham walking into his house one day and his wife was all tore up because of her motherhood duties and he didn't get on to her he walked over to her and put his hand on her and begin to pray for him brother man said what is I doing I changed the atmosphere Moses did it Jesus did it brother Brandon did it you can do it in your home you can change the atmosphere you can change how you're living you can change how you talk to your wife you can change how you talk to your children a wife can change how she talks to the husband and they can make an atmosphere bring that atmosphere right into that house we're a body change take place in your living room instead of an old television taking preeminence over your living room the spirit of the Living God moves through the house with claiming authority over that 14 year old girl's body and it begins to claim her mind thinking on the Promises of God begins to roam through the house with a claim and anointing changing hearts and changing Minds because you let something in the house that could change things one of the greatest conversions I ever saw personally in my life was Matt morse's wife she's a she's a tremendous young lady but but she was in the world she was having trouble I was on the road she called and said by the way Matt called me said when you're going to come home I said I'll be home in a couple days he said Sarah wants to see you and and she knew she knew in her heart that I had a great burden to see her saved but she was living the wrong kind of life and she met me at the house one night when I come off of the road and she's talked to me a little while and there were some issues and things needed to be corrected and things and she looked right at me and she said do I have to correct them I said you'll either correct them or you'll never be right with God and when she looked at me she said I'll do it right now and when that girl corrected this situation she came back in there and she said I'm ready now we got down on the floor of my living room and when I moved out of that house there was still spots where that girl had cried her way to Christ that my wife kept an atmosphere in my home that a conversion could take place in the living room your home doesn't have to be that way it can have an atmosphere where the power of God can just drop you in any moment and change things situations could change lives could change you said by the way I'm having these great issues I'm sorry brother Ron I mean I'm having these great issues and these great situations we need marriage counseling we need this no you need atmosphere you need to be so aware of the atmosphere that you quit putting those mean words into it until you quit talking to one another in that tone and let that atmosphere come that sweetens hearts Sweden's lives and changes do you see what is see what is happening is God is getting ready to change some people he's getting ready to change some lives and hearts and it begins with your atmosphere where you live and I I believe it this morning amen I believe can our musicians come I believe there's atmosphere that is created but I wouldn't know that if it hadn't been revealed in this generation William Branham could walk into a Coliseum where they didn't even have church and within a few nights he would have such a reverence in that building to the angel of the Lord could come right into place yeah I know you've heard I know you've heard us talk about it we've heard talking about sitting in my living room table and brother Ron just start talking about the Lord and his encounters and the spirit of God Brother Ray asked actually the presence of God just came so so powerfully young young children started showing reverence and people began to sing and because it was an atmosphere we didn't have to go to church we didn't have to go find a holy man somewhere we didn't start talking about the Lord the next thing you know there was such an anointing such a presence [Music] that anointing in this building it's here right now I started talking about them homes and I felt I felt a change in the room and I I don't I don't try to be here I don't know there's gifted men like that I'm probably not that one but I but you can feel that shift you pick you picked that up you know just in the preaching and you realize the holy spirit's dealing with something right there dealing with a heart right there see take your mind out of that Facebook not preaching against Facebook but it's consuming you who would have ever knew that Fox News and CNN would be the cause of the downfall many good men because they start focusing on the negative quit praying they go out here in a world full of Jezebels working every day and they get their mind off of the Lord they get their mind off of God it's the news and politics and presidents and religion and ideas of man the next thing you know they're in a place that's so dark then they take a lovely little wife that serves them at home and loves them next thing you know she's ugly to you eyes on something Jezebel somewhere that somebody's put thirty thousand dollars in to make her look like that but you know what's real what's real Christian woman what's real is a real Godly mother a real Godly that's what's real that's that's what will stay with you that's what will be there when everything else fails [Music] but it's a it's a turn I'm sorry I know this is Mother's Day but it's a turning of the atmosphere it's going to change bodies [Music] change that life if you just change the focus of it [Music] I believe we could do that right now don't you I believe we could do it now can we just close our eyes maybe let's just bow our hearts maybe the Lord's speaking to you today we know this change is coming upon our bodies but as this blending begins to happen God here in this room today spelling I'd like to change I'd like to change some things at home God bless you I'd like to change some things I like that atmosphere at home I want it to be when somebody walks in that door that convictions they leave somebody to Christ oh there it is yes sir yes sir thank you Lord thank you thank you Father thank you Lord thank you Jesus oh my thank you Lord maybe you're
