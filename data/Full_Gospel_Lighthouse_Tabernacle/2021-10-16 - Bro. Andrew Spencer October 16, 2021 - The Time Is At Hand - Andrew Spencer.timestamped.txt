[48:30] and then also down uh in ephesians
[48:33] chapter one
[48:34] and verse nine
[48:37] revelations chapter one first and then
[48:39] ephesians
[48:41] chapter one amen
[48:44] everybody have a good week
[48:47] amen we'll praise the lord
[48:49] amen
[48:59] man revelations chapter 1 and before we
[49:01] read let's just speak to the author
[49:05] of this holy word
[49:07] heavenly father we approach your throne
[49:09] of mercy and grace just now
[49:12] nor do we humble our life before you
[49:14] lord jesus
[49:15] set ourself aside lord that we might be
[49:18] used
[49:19] according to your
[49:21] holy plan
[49:22] well we realize that it's not a human
[49:24] ability but we realize that it is you
[49:27] that are working in humanity and is
[49:29] redeeming humanity
[49:31] and we invite you here in our midst here
[49:33] this evening father
[49:35] to be god over every situation
[49:38] lord and to take this word and begin to
[49:40] speak to your children today
[49:42] we love and appreciate you for all that
[49:44] you have done how that you have seen us
[49:46] through another week lord but one more
[49:47] time as we
[49:49] come and sit under the auspices of your
[49:51] word lord we ask god
[49:53] that thou would just minister to us in a
[49:55] supernatural way
[49:56] lord i pray that you take the word and
[49:58] speak to your children and we'll be
[50:00] careful to serve you and praise your
[50:01] holy name
[50:03] amen and amen amen revelations chapter 1
[50:07] verse 1
[50:08] the revelation of jesus christ which god
[50:11] gave unto him
[50:13] to show
[50:15] unto his servants things which must
[50:16] shortly come to pass
[50:19] and he sent and signified it by his
[50:21] angel
[50:22] unto his servant john who bear record of
[50:24] the word of god and of the testimony of
[50:28] jesus christ aren't you thankful for the
[50:30] testimony of jesus christ
[50:32] and of all things that he saw
[50:34] well blessed is he that readeth and they
[50:37] that hear the words of this prophecy and
[50:39] we realize
[50:41] and understand by the greek dialect and
[50:44] the dictionary on the greek that we
[50:46] realize that that word here is not
[50:48] necessarily of hearing through the ear
[50:50] but it is understanding
[50:52] because there could be maybe a drunk
[50:54] that would come off the street this
[50:56] evening and would hear these words and
[50:58] he would be able to say what was said
[51:00] here but it does not mean that he's able
[51:02] to understand it but there is an elect
[51:04] people that understand the very true
[51:07] meaning of what is being said here but
[51:10] notice and keep those things which are
[51:13] written therein for the time
[51:16] is at hand
[51:17] amen as you're turning to ephesians
[51:19] chapter one and verse nine and we'd like
[51:21] to speak to you on that that text there
[51:23] that the time
[51:25] is at hand and i truly believe that we
[51:27] are a blessed people this evening
[51:30] to be able to say that we have found him
[51:33] handled him
[51:35] and understand that this is
[51:37] the very true and living god that is
[51:39] amongst us
[51:41] amen ephesians chapter 1 and verse 9
[51:44] having made known unto us the mystery of
[51:47] his will
[51:49] according to his good pleasure which he
[51:51] hath purposed
[51:53] in himself
[51:54] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[51:57] of times he might gather together in one
[51:59] all things
[52:01] in christ both which are in heaven and
[52:03] which are on earth even in him and we
[52:06] realize that all creation is growing
[52:10] that all creation is groaning for the
[52:12] fullness of the dispensation of times
[52:14] and we realize that when sin will cease
[52:17] is when this fullness of time will be
[52:20] and you can hear brother branham speak
[52:22] of that text when you go and listen on
[52:24] into the future home but notice in verse
[52:27] 11 in whom also we have obtained an
[52:31] inheritance being predestinated
[52:33] according to the purpose of him who
[52:36] worketh all things after the council of
[52:39] his own will so we can agree this
[52:41] evening that our destiny is in our hands
[52:44] that our pre our our purpose has been
[52:47] pre-planned before we ever got here that
[52:50] our name was not just put on the lamb's
[52:52] book of life when we when we caught it
[52:54] but it happened before the foundation of
[52:56] the world it wasn't something that just
[52:58] happened just when when you were down at
[53:00] the altar but it was back there you were
[53:03] back there with him and he purposed in
[53:06] his heart he purposed in his heart
[53:09] all things
[53:11] that verse 12 that we should be to the
[53:13] praise
[53:14] of his glory who first trusted in christ
[53:18] in whom ye also trusted after that you
[53:21] heard the word of truth the gospel of
[53:23] your salvation in whom also after
[53:26] that you believed you were sealed with
[53:29] that holy spirit of promise
[53:31] which is the earnest of our inheritance
[53:34] until the redemption of the purchased
[53:37] possession
[53:38] under the praise of his glory may god
[53:41] bless his word he may be seated in the
[53:42] presence of the lord so he said we'd
[53:44] like to speak to you on the time
[53:47] the time is at hand and we look and we
[53:49] see in verse 13 there that that paul was
[53:52] speaking to those that are a pre-planned
[53:55] and a predetermined people showing that
[53:58] god has thought of us before the
[53:59] foundation of the world but notice what
[54:02] the scriptures say that after you that
[54:04] you heard the word of truth that after
[54:06] you believed and you were sealed with
[54:09] the holy spirit of promise it was after
[54:11] that you believe and you remember when
[54:13] paul caught that people up there those
[54:15] bunch of baptists when he went up there
[54:17] in the in the upper coast of
[54:19] ephesus and he had caught those baptists
[54:21] up there and he began to speak to them
[54:23] and they he began to ask them had they
[54:25] received the holy ghost and uh of yet
[54:28] and they said we don't know whether
[54:29] there'd be any holy ghost as of yet and
[54:31] he began to speak to him and he said
[54:32] well how was you baptized and they said
[54:34] well we were baptized under john's
[54:37] baptism unto repentance and john
[54:40] paul began to speak to them he began to
[54:42] speak to them and take them he didn't
[54:44] leave them where he found them but paul
[54:47] began to take the baptists that were
[54:49] there under the light of that day or
[54:51] under the light of that former day but
[54:53] he began to take them to the light of
[54:55] that day
[54:56] of the current day that there was more
[54:59] that was out there than what was being
[55:01] taught of just under john's baptism of
[55:04] repentance of remission of sins but now
[55:06] there was one that you could take on and
[55:09] you remember when after they after paul
[55:12] had preached these things that
[55:13] immediately they went and they did not
[55:15] baptize them in titles but he went out
[55:18] there and he baptized them in the name
[55:20] of the lord jesus christ and we realize
[55:23] this evening that paul was paul was
[55:25] taking them to another level of faith
[55:28] and they though they were living in the
[55:30] glare of the word of another day but yet
[55:33] paul was taking them to another to
[55:35] another level and it's amazing how the
[55:38] word of god will come by your way and
[55:41] maybe you're in a spot or in a condition
[55:43] or in a disease or or in some kind of
[55:45] thing but god does not leave you where
[55:47] he found you but god will take you to a
[55:50] level in which what's predetermined for
[55:53] your day
[55:54] what good would it have done if we to
[55:56] come and preach wesley's message wesley
[55:58] already fulfilled that but this is the
[56:01] hour of the very elect of god that has
[56:03] to meet the challenge of the hour we
[56:06] could not have a rapture under the man
[56:08] anointing but there had to be an ego
[56:10] anointing that would come and match the
[56:13] time and match the people that would
[56:15] match the persons of the rapture and you
[56:18] watch immediately after paul goes to
[56:21] preaching these things that the
[56:23] miraculous begins to take place after
[56:26] that the lord has come forth your what
[56:28] after meetings after meetings prayer
[56:30] line up to prayer line listening to tape
[56:33] after tape that you'll watch as the
[56:35] angel after the lord has gone forth that
[56:37] the angel comes and vindicates what has
[56:40] went forth and here when paul preaches
[56:43] he preaches on the baptism of the holy
[56:45] ghost he preaches on the remissions of
[56:47] sins in the name of the lord jesus
[56:50] christ but you remember if you go up
[56:52] there in the later part of acts chapter
[56:53] 19 that he gets up there and he starts
[56:56] dealing and he begins to tell us of
[56:57] those vagabond jews those exorcists you
[57:00] remember the scripture that he begins to
[57:02] deal with them and and those vagabond
[57:04] jews or seven sons of skeva they took
[57:07] upon themselves to declare or to say
[57:10] over those with an evil spirit
[57:12] they begin to rebuke in the name of the
[57:14] lord jesus christ they took it upon
[57:17] themselves in whom paul preaches we
[57:20] rebuke you but notice that if you go
[57:23] down and study the scriptures that the
[57:25] bible said that the evil spirit answered
[57:28] it said jesus we know and paul we know
[57:31] but who are you so even the very evil
[57:35] spirits that were in these men or in
[57:37] these in these people these exorcists
[57:40] these exorcists tried to take on and
[57:42] tried to operate in the name of the lord
[57:44] jesus christ but the evil spirit
[57:47] recognized that they were preaching what
[57:50] they were preaching could not be backed
[57:52] up by the life that they were living
[57:55] but there is again another people in the
[57:58] land who under their messenger will be a
[58:01] final voice to the final age and though
[58:04] these evil spirits knew that these men
[58:07] the seven sons of skiva what they were
[58:09] preaching couldn't live up or couldn't
[58:12] chalk up to what they were preaching but
[58:14] these evil spirits knew the message that
[58:17] paul was preaching that it could produce
[58:20] the power it could produce the power to
[58:23] cast these evil spirits out
[58:26] because you'll notice that if you study
[58:27] the scriptures that the bible says that
[58:30] the name of the lord jesus christ it
[58:32] doesn't say that it decreased but it
[58:35] said that the name of the lord jesus was
[58:37] magnified
[58:39] the enemy may have thought that he won
[58:41] but the name of jesus christ will always
[58:44] come out on top
[58:46] these men knew that the message that
[58:48] paul was preaching could produce a power
[58:51] that would make them run and hide for
[58:53] cover
[58:54] and you remember on behalf beyond the
[58:56] curtain of time when he asked him he
[58:59] when he asked him said well who are
[59:00] those he said those are your converts
[59:02] those are your people they're not
[59:04] brandons those are your people and those
[59:06] people said were resting on that what
[59:08] were they resting on they were resting
[59:11] he said well will paul be but paul go in
[59:14] with his people he said paul we're going
[59:17] with his people he said well i have
[59:19] preached what paul has preached
[59:22] this same message that has restored the
[59:24] faith back to the pentecostal fathers
[59:27] this is that that was preached by the
[59:30] prophet paul and this is that that has
[59:32] restored our faith back to the faith of
[59:35] the pentecostal fathers it's a restored
[59:38] word with a restored faith
[59:41] and it produces same science
[59:46] same wonders
[59:47] same miracles
[59:49] faith is restored back to the church
[59:53] of the living god you remember when jude
[59:55] would go over there and you look over in
[59:57] the book of jude verse 3 it would tell
[59:59] us that we are to contend for the faith
[1:00:02] there's only one faith
[1:00:04] one faith one baptism one lord one god
[1:00:08] and father of all who's above all
[1:00:10] through all and in you all it's one
[1:00:12] faith
[1:00:14] and we are to contend
[1:00:16] for that faith but we notice that this
[1:00:19] is the hour or the hour of the
[1:00:21] miraculous is at hand because he's still
[1:00:24] the same yesterday today and forever and
[1:00:27] we realize that the bible would tell us
[1:00:29] in romans 10 and 17 that faith comes by
[1:00:33] hearing and the hearing by the word of
[1:00:35] god but faith is never built upon
[1:00:38] sympathy
[1:00:39] and faith never comes through discussing
[1:00:42] with people about their pains about
[1:00:44] their agonies about their aches and
[1:00:46] about their illnesses and about their
[1:00:48] weaknesses and about their all of their
[1:00:50] diseases faith is never built upon what
[1:00:53] you're going through but faith is built
[1:00:56] upon the very word of god and faith is
[1:00:59] born when we hear the word of god and
[1:01:02] jesus would say that you shall know the
[1:01:05] truth and the truth shall make you free
[1:01:08] and we realize who is truth it's not a
[1:01:10] man it's not an idea but it is the man
[1:01:14] jesus christ he said in john 17 i am
[1:01:18] truth
[1:01:20] and it is our times as sons and
[1:01:22] daughters of god to declare war on every
[1:01:26] form of sickness in every demon or every
[1:01:29] high thing that exalts itself against
[1:01:31] the very throne of god and to take
[1:01:33] authority over every demon power through
[1:01:37] the name of jesus christ you as sons of
[1:01:40] god are not to stand there as some
[1:01:42] weakling as some wimpy little boy you're
[1:01:44] gonna stand there as a child of god a
[1:01:47] child of the most high god and declare
[1:01:50] that i am a part of the great i am my
[1:01:52] name is identified with him he purposed
[1:01:55] me but for the foundation of the world i
[1:01:58] am in his plan my plan is predetermined
[1:02:01] cancer can't kill me sickness can't win
[1:02:04] over me diabetes can't destroy your
[1:02:07] liver
[1:02:09] high blood pressure will not be the
[1:02:11] conqueror but you as a mighty talker
[1:02:14] will conquer every gate of the enemy
[1:02:18] and you will do with it as you please
[1:02:20] because you are children of abraham
[1:02:28] hallelujah
[1:02:30] it's a time like never before to believe
[1:02:33] for the impossible
[1:02:35] and the impossible takes place when god
[1:02:38] is taken at his word when jesus had two
[1:02:41] women that were in a distraught
[1:02:43] situation he didn't talk to them about
[1:02:45] their circumstance he didn't talk to
[1:02:47] them about what they seen but he began
[1:02:49] to take them beyond what they see and
[1:02:52] told them to look past what you see and
[1:02:55] feel past what you feel
[1:02:57] [Applause]
[1:02:59] are you with me he began to take them to
[1:03:01] another level it was a time when they
[1:03:04] had not seen this kind of thing since
[1:03:07] the days of elijah when he was put in
[1:03:10] there and that soldier fell on that
[1:03:12] bounce
[1:03:13] of bones of elijah because there was a
[1:03:15] promise that was laying there and when
[1:03:17] they watched the god of abraham the god
[1:03:20] of lazarus was there just with the same
[1:03:24] kind of quickening power that was upon
[1:03:26] elijah's bones and they realized that
[1:03:29] this was the same one that had made a
[1:03:32] promise over top of elisha
[1:03:35] he won't forget where you're at
[1:03:37] you can bury us you can try to stop us
[1:03:40] out you can try to kill us out but
[1:03:41] there's a promise hanging over top of
[1:03:44] every single one of your loved ones they
[1:03:45] may have whipped by the way of the grave
[1:03:47] but there's a promise
[1:03:50] there's a promise that they shall rise
[1:03:52] again
[1:03:53] you bury anything in jesus name and
[1:03:56] it'll come up
[1:03:58] is that right
[1:04:00] you bury anything in jesus name and
[1:04:02] it'll come up
[1:04:03] can he say amen
[1:04:05] you bury anything in the name of jesus
[1:04:07] christ and it'll go it'll come up amen
[1:04:10] i'm not just repeating or i'm not just
[1:04:12] stuck but you bury anything in the name
[1:04:14] of jesus christ and it'll come up
[1:04:18] but you see the difference
[1:04:20] you see the difference when you watch
[1:04:22] somebody as they begin to sow seeds
[1:04:24] that you'll watch if you're not real and
[1:04:27] paying attention that you'll watch that
[1:04:29] planning
[1:04:30] and burying look like the same exact
[1:04:33] thing
[1:04:35] they go into the same kind of ground
[1:04:37] they go into the same kind of dirt
[1:04:40] but you'll notice that you got to pay
[1:04:42] attention one's planted
[1:04:44] and one's buried
[1:04:46] but you have took on the name of jesus
[1:04:48] christ and he is as good as his word and
[1:04:52] he knows the timing and the season to
[1:04:55] raise you up for such a time as this
[1:04:58] what was esther doing in the kingdom at
[1:05:00] that time it was because there was a
[1:05:03] season for it
[1:05:04] and what is the bride doing in the worst
[1:05:07] of days in the laodicean church age what
[1:05:10] is she doing there for such a time as
[1:05:13] this god
[1:05:14] that which he's planning will come forth
[1:05:18] it's a time of sowing it's a time of
[1:05:20] reaping and it's a time for harvest
[1:05:23] [Applause]
[1:05:28] amen
[1:05:30] f bosworth wrote
[1:05:33] you go read his book
[1:05:35] he said when i ask people
[1:05:37] if they think it's god's will to heal
[1:05:39] them
[1:05:40] and they reply that they don't know
[1:05:42] whether it is or not
[1:05:43] i then ask them if it's god's will to
[1:05:45] keep his promise
[1:05:50] if you don't know if it's god's will for
[1:05:51] you to get out of your trouble ask
[1:05:53] yourself the question is it god's will
[1:05:55] for him to keep his promise
[1:05:57] he said that i was wounded for your
[1:06:00] transgressions i was bruised for your
[1:06:02] iniquities the chastisement of your
[1:06:05] peace is upon me and with my stripes
[1:06:08] that i took in pilate's judgment hall
[1:06:10] you may feel like god ain't obligated to
[1:06:13] you and maybe he ain't obligated to your
[1:06:16] flesh but god is obligated to his
[1:06:18] promise and you that have been buried in
[1:06:20] his name
[1:06:23] oh come on somebody god's got a promise
[1:06:26] yes well i'm not good enough i'm too
[1:06:28] young i'm too old you're always going to
[1:06:30] have excuses that are staring you at the
[1:06:33] face but there is a promise that is
[1:06:35] hanging over every top of every son and
[1:06:38] daughter of god through covet through
[1:06:40] crisis through anxiety through
[1:06:43] depression through back pain through
[1:06:45] barrenness god has got a promise hanging
[1:06:47] over top of his children
[1:06:51] and he's obligated to his word
[1:06:55] but you remember in the junction of time
[1:06:56] that brother branham would say that that
[1:06:58] at every junction there would be angels
[1:07:01] appear there will be signs and wonders
[1:07:03] that would be produced there will be
[1:07:05] signposts that would point us it was
[1:07:07] never before
[1:07:09] it was never before but it was always at
[1:07:11] the junction that these signs and these
[1:07:14] wonders that were done it's at every
[1:07:17] junction
[1:07:18] at every crossroad these things are
[1:07:21] transferring and these things are
[1:07:23] happening if you could catch it in your
[1:07:25] own mind that you are at a junction
[1:07:29] you're at a junction of the ending of
[1:07:31] time and right into the blending of
[1:07:33] eternity
[1:07:35] what happened to william branham was not
[1:07:37] just for william branham that angel
[1:07:39] didn't leave when william branham left
[1:07:42] that same angel is here and he's still
[1:07:44] doing signs and he's still doing wonders
[1:07:47] what did he say he said if god did that
[1:07:49] for all those little junctions back
[1:07:51] there what will he do when all hell was
[1:07:53] turned loose he said all heaven would be
[1:07:56] turned loose
[1:07:57] yes well i don't know if i can
[1:07:58] understand her i don't know if i can
[1:08:00] believe all that brother andrew you just
[1:08:01] watch
[1:08:02] god will vindicate his word in healing
[1:08:05] and in powers and every time at the
[1:08:07] crossroads at the junction at the
[1:08:09] changing in the dispensations of time
[1:08:13] that's when he proves and vindicates
[1:08:15] that he's there
[1:08:17] he's right amongst you and he's still
[1:08:19] doing the same thing that he did back
[1:08:21] there
[1:08:22] you remember at the junction when israel
[1:08:25] was in a spot
[1:08:26] when it looked like god had forgot her
[1:08:29] down there in that foreign land for over
[1:08:32] 400 years
[1:08:34] it looked like god had forgotten but
[1:08:36] before god would ever turn his finger
[1:08:39] toward israel he had to produce the
[1:08:41] omnipotence
[1:08:44] before any time or any changeover god
[1:08:47] has got to prove himself that he's still
[1:08:50] the omnipotent god amen
[1:08:53] brother branham said that there was
[1:08:54] priests and there was rabbis in that day
[1:08:57] just like there is in this day that said
[1:08:59] that the days of miracles had done went
[1:09:02] out of existence just like they're doing
[1:09:04] again today they say we shouldn't have
[1:09:07] these type of things but god still
[1:09:09] produces them they said we shouldn't
[1:09:11] believe for the miraculous but god still
[1:09:14] does the miraculous they say we ought
[1:09:16] should not believe for our prodigals but
[1:09:18] god still brings in prodigals they say
[1:09:21] we shouldn't believe that those that are
[1:09:23] ate up with cancer should be healed but
[1:09:25] god still delivers of cancer they say we
[1:09:28] shouldn't believe for dead babies in a
[1:09:30] womb but god still delivers
[1:09:33] alive babies
[1:09:37] but it was at the time of israel's
[1:09:39] deliverance that the miraculous begin to
[1:09:42] take place and right here we are again
[1:09:46] yeah
[1:09:46] at another junction in time when the
[1:09:49] church israel needs deliverance from
[1:09:52] this laodicean flu
[1:09:57] it's a time to move on
[1:09:59] it's a time for a change it's a time to
[1:10:01] go on
[1:10:05] well we're message believers we're down
[1:10:07] here in egypt
[1:10:09] i understand
[1:10:12] we've got joseph's bones down here
[1:10:15] they could point every day of their
[1:10:17] slave life
[1:10:18] and they could go back to what moses
[1:10:21] or what abraham had said
[1:10:23] that god had said that his seed was
[1:10:25] sojourned in a strange land and then the
[1:10:28] prophets of jacob and joseph would catch
[1:10:31] on to that prophecy
[1:10:33] and they would realize and they would go
[1:10:36] over there and they would say now when i
[1:10:37] die don't you leave my bones down here
[1:10:40] because there's coming a
[1:10:42] deliverer as coming a deliverer and
[1:10:45] there is no resurrection power if you
[1:10:48] plant me over here in some trinitarian
[1:10:51] creed or some trinitarian dogma there's
[1:10:53] no life over there but i believe that
[1:10:56] the time is very soon when god will send
[1:10:59] a deliverer that would take us more than
[1:11:01] just back to some dead creed some dead
[1:11:04] dogma you can hide it in a casket
[1:11:07] but you can't have the promise
[1:11:11] and they could walk by there and they
[1:11:12] could lay their hands on that old steel
[1:11:15] dead casket when there was no life there
[1:11:18] but they could point back there but god
[1:11:21] needed to send them a fresh revival send
[1:11:24] them a fresh scene they had joseph's
[1:11:27] bones
[1:11:29] they had what joseph said but they
[1:11:31] needed to see god firsthand for
[1:11:34] themselves
[1:11:35] now i know i'm preaching to you right
[1:11:36] now you've been in the spot you said
[1:11:38] well i seen brother ron what he went
[1:11:40] through i've seen what others have went
[1:11:42] through but what about me you are in a
[1:11:45] season for the miraculous to take place
[1:11:57] he's the same
[1:11:59] yesterday today
[1:12:01] and forever
[1:12:03] you remember when elijah
[1:12:05] and elijah were making their last trip
[1:12:06] together and they were going forward
[1:12:10] you remember
[1:12:11] when elijah asked him said what do you
[1:12:13] ask of me he said i ask of you a double
[1:12:17] portion of thy spirit
[1:12:19] and he said now you're asking a very
[1:12:21] hard thing of me
[1:12:22] he said but if you see me when i go
[1:12:26] you'll know that the promise is coming
[1:12:28] by your household
[1:12:30] you see just like jesus would say yet a
[1:12:33] little while the world won't see me but
[1:12:35] you'll see me
[1:12:36] because i live you'll live also
[1:12:40] now notice
[1:12:41] what elijah when he got over there when
[1:12:44] he got over there and he got in that
[1:12:46] spot or that condition he'd just watch
[1:12:48] elijah how he went over on dry ground he
[1:12:51] he'd smoked the waters and he walked
[1:12:54] over and this and the school of the
[1:12:56] prophets were watching him go over and
[1:12:58] he said don't you fear that your master
[1:13:01] and don't you know that your master's
[1:13:02] going to be taken away from you and he
[1:13:04] told him to hold their peace
[1:13:06] but he got over there and he watched the
[1:13:08] miraculous take place right in front of
[1:13:11] his eyes
[1:13:12] elisha could go back and he could
[1:13:14] remember he could remember what god had
[1:13:17] done to elijah up there on mel karma he
[1:13:19] could remember how that he healed the
[1:13:22] bitter waters he could remember how he
[1:13:24] took that stick and he floated in there
[1:13:26] and that axe head came up god knows
[1:13:28] where you're living at and gonna produce
[1:13:31] the miraculous
[1:13:32] to show that he's still the same amen
[1:13:36] [Music]
[1:13:37] but notice
[1:13:39] he said a second ana robe was all right
[1:13:41] he said but he needed a fresh call in
[1:13:44] his heart
[1:13:48] he needed a fresh call
[1:13:50] in his heart from god
[1:13:52] he needed a fresh anointing from god
[1:13:56] he wore a second-handed robe
[1:13:59] when he come to the river but he needed
[1:14:01] a brand new first-handed call from god
[1:14:04] and a first-handed power from god to
[1:14:07] perform the miracle
[1:14:09] when he got over there he'd watched all
[1:14:11] these things transpire and he said but
[1:14:14] where be the god
[1:14:16] of elijah
[1:14:18] now notice what brother branham said he
[1:14:21] said to my brother don't you be afraid
[1:14:23] to ask god anything
[1:14:25] [Music]
[1:14:26] you must demand god or ask god for
[1:14:29] anything that he has promised he said if
[1:14:31] i am introducing a god that's omnipotent
[1:14:35] and all-powerful and if i be a servant
[1:14:37] of god i must do the works of god and if
[1:14:40] i do the works of god i must be a man of
[1:14:42] god to bring these things to pass
[1:14:45] because he's demanding of me to produce
[1:14:49] the impossible
[1:14:51] he said i have to ask him i have to call
[1:14:53] upon him and stand there and say god you
[1:14:56] promised it
[1:14:58] and so do you every person
[1:15:03] he said you shall receive power in acts
[1:15:05] 1 and 8 after the holy spirit's come
[1:15:07] upon you after the holy spirit's come
[1:15:09] upon you and after you've robed as a
[1:15:11] christian after your faith is set in
[1:15:13] christ then you shall receive power
[1:15:16] there you are
[1:15:18] and brother and sister
[1:15:20] everyone at that morning
[1:15:22] may i say this before praying for the
[1:15:24] sick
[1:15:25] may i say this by god's help
[1:15:27] you pray for me
[1:15:30] as i stood here ten years ago at this
[1:15:32] platform preaching on david and goliath
[1:15:34] now it isn't that goliath that's
[1:15:36] hindered me
[1:15:41] it isn't that the life that's hindered
[1:15:43] me
[1:15:44] here
[1:15:46] here is a gentile prophet
[1:15:48] that's seen more miracles done in his
[1:15:50] own ministry than what was happening in
[1:15:53] jesus's own ministry
[1:15:56] it isn't that the life that's hindered
[1:15:58] me
[1:15:59] god has slayed him
[1:16:01] before me
[1:16:04] but the thing that's hindering me
[1:16:07] is the lack of faith
[1:16:09] the lack of something that i know was
[1:16:12] around and this morning before this
[1:16:14] little tabernacle i'm screaming
[1:16:17] where is the god who gave the promise
[1:16:20] where is the god who met us yonder come
[1:16:23] forward god and give me courage give me
[1:16:26] strength give me a determined mind
[1:16:28] regardless of what comes or what goes
[1:16:30] whether it looks dark or whether it
[1:16:32] looks whatever it looks like move on the
[1:16:35] promise is true
[1:16:38] or the random was a human like you're a
[1:16:40] human but brother branham was not
[1:16:42] determined on his own human emotion or
[1:16:44] what he felt or what he's seen
[1:16:48] [Music]
[1:16:56] all right
[1:16:57] well be the god of elijah if he did it
[1:16:59] in days gone by where's he at if he did
[1:17:02] it in william branham's day where's he
[1:17:04] at if he did it for elijah vote if he
[1:17:07] did it for a lives of hope where is he
[1:17:09] at right now
[1:17:11] if it's still the same where's he at
[1:17:16] you're asking for the miraculous you've
[1:17:17] got to believe for the miraculous you're
[1:17:19] asking for protocols to return you've
[1:17:22] got to believe that prodigals will
[1:17:23] return you're asking for restoration
[1:17:26] you've got to believe for restoration
[1:17:29] it's not the goliath the goliath's
[1:17:31] already been delivered and he's not
[1:17:33] hindering you it's the lack of faith
[1:17:37] you must believe
[1:17:39] all things are possible
[1:17:42] to them that
[1:17:45] belief
[1:17:47] amen
[1:17:48] [Music]
[1:17:53] give me a courage
[1:17:55] give me a strength
[1:17:57] and give me a determined mind
[1:18:02] write it down put it on your
[1:18:03] refrigerator give me courage give me
[1:18:06] strength and give me a determined mind
[1:18:12] so many times people get caught up on
[1:18:14] feelings
[1:18:16] and their expectation never matches
[1:18:19] their feelings
[1:18:21] but our expectation is not feeling our
[1:18:24] expectation is healing
[1:18:27] our expectation is not emotion our
[1:18:29] expectation is god
[1:18:32] our expectation is not what we see with
[1:18:34] our eyes it's what he says in his word
[1:18:39] give me courage give me strength give me
[1:18:42] a determined mind oh god like never
[1:18:45] before give me the perseverance like
[1:18:48] george washington give me the strength
[1:18:50] like sam said give me the love like
[1:18:53] jesus give me a song like david give me
[1:18:56] a prayer life like daniel
[1:18:58] [Music]
[1:18:59] [Applause]
[1:19:01] the bible said in proverbs 28 and 1 that
[1:19:04] the wicked flee when no man chaseth
[1:19:07] after them
[1:19:09] amen
[1:19:10] but the righteous are as bold as a lion
[1:19:15] god don't want no cowards
[1:19:18] cowards will never be used in this army
[1:19:20] god's looking for somebody that's got a
[1:19:22] backbone
[1:19:24] somebody that'll stand as a rugged son
[1:19:26] and daughter of god that stressed
[1:19:28] himself in the weaponry of ephesians six
[1:19:31] but they ain't just dressed themselves
[1:19:33] and god isn't the one just dressing you
[1:19:36] but also there is a job for you to do in
[1:19:39] verse 18 he said praying always with
[1:19:42] prayer and supplication at good times
[1:19:45] i'm praying at bad times i'm praying on
[1:19:48] the mountain i'm praying in the valley
[1:19:50] i'm praying when i get in my closet i'm
[1:19:52] praying when i'm on my knees on prayer
[1:19:55] when i'm driving in my car whether i see
[1:19:57] good or that i see bad no matter the
[1:20:00] healing no matter the expectations of
[1:20:02] what people want in their own mind
[1:20:04] i'm a walk right in my promise
[1:20:08] praying always
[1:20:12] the bible tells us to pray
[1:20:15] without ceasing
[1:20:18] when you stop praying you stop fighting
[1:20:21] and when you stop praying you stop
[1:20:23] winning
[1:20:24] every time you stop praying and you cut
[1:20:27] off your prayer life you watch you'll
[1:20:29] live a defeated life
[1:20:32] you can be dressed up in the finest
[1:20:34] armor but if you don't know how to pray
[1:20:36] and get in contact with the one that
[1:20:38] dressed you
[1:20:42] god is looking for a belief
[1:20:44] not somebody that just walks around
[1:20:46] confessing oh
[1:20:48] i believe like the baptists believe
[1:20:51] i believed under george repentance but
[1:20:53] there was a higher level
[1:20:56] it was something more than just easy
[1:20:58] believe there's some oppressing play and
[1:21:00] turning on a tape but it's when you come
[1:21:02] down and the rubber meets the road and
[1:21:05] the devil stares at you right after you
[1:21:07] come off the mountain and he's looking
[1:21:09] at you and says do you got the goods you
[1:21:11] better know where you're standing at
[1:21:16] when the enemy came in for ron spencer
[1:21:18] what did he find he didn't find some
[1:21:20] coward that was built upon self-pity and
[1:21:23] self-worth he found a real rugged
[1:21:26] christian and a real soldier
[1:21:29] he might be a wounded soldier but i'll
[1:21:32] take a wounded soldier over a coward
[1:21:34] anything
[1:21:52] this week we
[1:21:54] this week we had a little
[1:21:56] little get-together for gabriel before
[1:21:58] he gets married
[1:22:00] the whole family
[1:22:01] come up here and
[1:22:03] my cousin michael came
[1:22:05] at a very very supernatural moment
[1:22:08] with michael
[1:22:09] you're very aware that we've been
[1:22:10] praying for him
[1:22:12] but he shared this with me
[1:22:14] and i promised him i'd give him credits
[1:22:17] from where i got this
[1:22:19] so michael here you go
[1:22:23] you could take it michael this is all
[1:22:25] this is all this is all for mike
[1:22:28] but he gave me this he said he said this
[1:22:30] this right here has stuck with me
[1:22:34] he said it was a philosopher
[1:22:36] and then later on told me he said
[1:22:38] heraclitus i don't even know who that
[1:22:39] dude is
[1:22:40] but he said
[1:22:42] somebody had to be smarter than me
[1:22:44] figure it out
[1:22:45] but he said out of every 100 men
[1:22:49] on a battlefield 10 shouldn't be there
[1:22:54] out of every 100 men 10 shouldn't be
[1:22:57] there
[1:22:59] 80 are just targets
[1:23:01] nine are the real fighters
[1:23:03] and we're lucky to have them for they
[1:23:06] make the battle
[1:23:08] ah
[1:23:09] but the one
[1:23:11] one is a warrior
[1:23:12] and he will bring the others back
[1:23:17] brother branham would say that he said
[1:23:18] now god's not looking he's looking for
[1:23:21] one person
[1:23:22] that i believe
[1:23:27] nine are real fighters but there's one
[1:23:29] that'll bring them back
[1:23:32] i heard it been said before
[1:23:34] i would rather i would rather be led
[1:23:37] i would rather be led
[1:23:39] or i'd rather be fighting with an army
[1:23:41] of sheep that is led by a lion
[1:23:44] then rather than a lot an army of lions
[1:23:46] that is led by a sheep
[1:23:52] you can be led by sheep and you can have
[1:23:54] the tenacity of a lion but if you ain't
[1:23:56] got somebody that can lead
[1:23:59] that can lead you into battles hey pick
[1:24:02] up that sword pick up that spear pick up
[1:24:05] your head
[1:24:06] we're going to win this thing you might
[1:24:08] be as weak as all get out but look out
[1:24:11] there in front of you the battle's
[1:24:13] already
[1:24:15] i'm thankful i got a pastor but more
[1:24:18] than that there's jesus on our side he
[1:24:20] said lift up your head
[1:24:26] you're not led by sheep you're led by a
[1:24:28] lie and brother branham said you are ten
[1:24:31] to the line of the tribe of judah you're
[1:24:34] not just some wishy-washy man's a pansy
[1:24:38] christian of the so-called religions of
[1:24:40] the world today you are a rugby son and
[1:24:43] daughter of god ken got the same blood
[1:24:46] as the lion of the tribe of judah you've
[1:24:48] got the tenacity of a lie to devour
[1:24:51] every enemy that comes against you
[1:24:55] we are as bold as alive
[1:25:05] what was moses doing out there
[1:25:07] that kind of tenacity
[1:25:10] he met somebody up there he met more
[1:25:12] than just a bush but he met a voice
[1:25:14] behind the voice
[1:25:16] he went up there and he was carrying
[1:25:18] this thick and they thought it was just
[1:25:19] a stick
[1:25:20] and the enemy thinks you're just
[1:25:21] carrying around some beat up old book
[1:25:24] it's more than just some beat up old
[1:25:26] book
[1:25:27] it's more than just got love letters in
[1:25:28] there it's got it's got weapons of your
[1:25:30] warfare in there and you as the bride of
[1:25:33] jesus christ are equipped like no other
[1:25:36] person you have the most powerful weapon
[1:25:39] that's ever been placed in the hand of
[1:25:41] humanity it's the very word of god and a
[1:25:44] prayer life to back it up
[1:25:49] moses could go out there
[1:25:51] and he could create life
[1:25:55] he could create and call for flies he
[1:25:58] could go out and
[1:25:59] create all these different things
[1:26:02] under the blood of bulls and goats what
[1:26:04] our son and daughter of god be able to
[1:26:06] do
[1:26:08] under the precious blood
[1:26:10] of the lamb
[1:26:13] [Music]
[1:26:16] moses
[1:26:17] had come to his time
[1:26:19] but he wasn't preaching noah's message
[1:26:23] he was preaching the message of the hour
[1:26:28] i could imagine moses going out there
[1:26:31] and preaching on contending for the
[1:26:34] faith
[1:26:34] i can imagine i can imagine him going
[1:26:37] out there and preaching on sirs
[1:26:40] is this the time of the sign the sign of
[1:26:43] the time that here we are this is what
[1:26:45] abraham said that there's going to be a
[1:26:48] people that are taking exodus that'll
[1:26:50] leave this whole egyptian world
[1:26:53] and he's walking up there with a promise
[1:26:57] amen he was walking up there with the
[1:26:59] message of the hour
[1:27:02] i could say that he probably preached on
[1:27:03] the contest
[1:27:05] knowing that he was going up there and
[1:27:06] faced pharaoh's magicians
[1:27:08] but you realize that that this ain't
[1:27:10] just some magic
[1:27:14] this ain't some magic wand that moses is
[1:27:17] handling
[1:27:18] that was a judgment rod
[1:27:22] but moses walked up there
[1:27:24] and he was carrying this rod
[1:27:27] you see vader ever got that out of his
[1:27:29] hand they'd had him whoop right there
[1:27:31] and if they can ever get your faith out
[1:27:33] of your hand and get the word of god out
[1:27:34] of your hand he's got you whipped right
[1:27:36] there
[1:27:37] we're not on some picnic here

[1:27:41] scriptures and packing up all these

[1:27:47] battlefield

[1:27:50] time now and realizing that it's coming

[1:28:23] beliefs and extreme beliefs cause for
[1:28:26] extreme miracles and this is the time
[1:28:29] for the miraculous

[1:32:31] brother ron no it's something there
[1:32:34] you as a congregation you know
[1:32:37] you know i
[1:32:39] i was be i
[1:32:40] i was way after brother homer's heyday
[1:32:46] when i was in diapers
[1:32:48] when i was in diapers man he was in his
[1:32:50] prime i don't remember that and you've
[1:32:52] come to me and said when you preach and
[1:32:54] you point that finger
[1:32:56] man it's like homer's looking right over
[1:32:58] top of that thing and he's talking
[1:32:59] what's in there
[1:33:01] it's the life of a frazier
[1:33:03] that's being expressed
[1:33:06] and when you see somebody
[1:33:09] operating like a coward
[1:33:12] there's a life of a coward in there
[1:33:16] can i get personal
[1:33:18] if you see somebody
[1:33:20] just roll up her shoulder so well the
[1:33:22] pastor will do it for me
[1:33:27] what's what's in there
[1:33:29] it's not the life of a son
[1:33:32] it's a life of a slave
[1:33:35] it's a life of a catholic
[1:33:38] come on
[1:33:39] amen
[1:33:43] but this ain't the time
[1:33:45] to live like a bunch of catholics
[1:33:48] this ain't the time to act like some
[1:33:50] days gone by
[1:33:51] this is the time for the bride to race
[1:33:54] to our feet and live under the auspices
[1:33:57] of the message of the hour this message
[1:33:59] didn't call you church he didn't call
[1:34:01] you back to some dead cold farmer
[1:34:03] religion and called you for bride time
[1:34:06] it called you up to an astronaut edge
[1:34:09] not to live down here in the hearts and
[1:34:10] buggies no more but come up here up here
[1:34:13] a little high come on up here come on up
[1:34:16] here where you're supposed to operate at
[1:34:18] [Applause]
[1:34:22] brother branham said i i believe in the
[1:34:24] fifth seal
[1:34:26] he said i believe that the hours
[1:34:27] approaching
[1:34:28] when missing limbs will be restored and
[1:34:32] the glorious power of the creator he
[1:34:34] said i believe that if he can make a
[1:34:36] squirrel up here
[1:34:39] and here is a man or a woman just got a
[1:34:41] little partner said and that's a
[1:34:43] complete animal in itself he's god
[1:34:46] if he can do that for a little fishing
[1:34:48] if he can do that for a little possum if
[1:34:50] he could do that for some animal some
[1:34:52] insignificant animal he's god and he
[1:34:54] cares about all things but how much more
[1:34:57] should he care about you when you're
[1:34:59] going through your situation
[1:35:01] this ain't just about the preacher this
[1:35:04] ain't just about the deacons and the
[1:35:06] boards this is about you
[1:35:11] i believe
[1:35:12] therefore i speak
[1:35:18] the bible said in deuteronomy 29 and 29
[1:35:21] that the secret things that belong to
[1:35:22] the lord our god
[1:35:24] the secret things belong to the lord our
[1:35:27] god but those things which are revealed
[1:35:30] belong unto us and our children forever
[1:35:33] that we might do all the words of this
[1:35:36] law
[1:35:38] the things that have been made manifest
[1:35:40] are rightfully yours and the bible said
[1:35:43] the lord is nigh you even in your mouth
[1:35:45] and in the heart that thou mayest do it
[1:35:48] and you are anointed like never before
[1:35:50] to go out there and meet the challenge
[1:35:52] of the enemy
[1:35:54] it's your time it's your duty it come
[1:35:57] time when saul wouldn't answer the call
[1:35:59] but there come time for a david
[1:36:02] when nobody else would rise up when
[1:36:04] there were greater men than him it was
[1:36:06] david's time when saul looked like he
[1:36:08] was right for the job saul wasn't right
[1:36:10] for the job when it looked like the
[1:36:12] other brothers were right for the job
[1:36:14] they weren't right for the job
[1:36:16] you can have all the mechanics in order
[1:36:18] but until the dynamics get there
[1:36:21] you can have all the scriptures in order
[1:36:24] but until the life begins to fall right
[1:36:26] in there
[1:36:28] it begins to operate
[1:36:30] now notice
[1:36:31] notice what happened when the anointing
[1:36:33] came
[1:36:35] it didn't change
[1:36:36] he didn't change david but he was
[1:36:38] already a seed
[1:36:40] he was already a seed it was something
[1:36:42] already laying there in there that could
[1:36:44] be produced
[1:36:46] and the life just flowed out
[1:36:48] you did not become seed by the rebirth
[1:36:51] you were seed therefore you could be
[1:36:54] reborn
[1:36:59] and when david went over there
[1:37:02] i'm bringing this too close
[1:37:04] nowhere close to being finished
[1:37:07] but when david went over there
[1:37:10] brother brandon said he didn't go over
[1:37:11] there in his earthly father's possession
[1:37:14] he said he went over there in his
[1:37:15] heavenly father's position
[1:37:17] he said his earthly father's possession
[1:37:20] was when he could say i killed a lion
[1:37:22] and i killed a bear
[1:37:23] he said but when he went over there in
[1:37:25] his heavenly father's position
[1:37:27] he said this day i'll take your head off
[1:37:30] of your shoulders
[1:37:32] you're not operating in your earthly
[1:37:34] father's possession
[1:37:36] you're operating
[1:37:38] in your heavenly father's possession
[1:37:41] why stand there and cry
[1:37:43] speak
[1:37:44] and go forward
[1:37:46] if he can get you out of egypt
[1:37:48] he can sure get you into a promised land
[1:37:52] god bless you let's stand this evening
[1:37:55] amen give the lord a hand clapping
[1:37:56] please
[1:38:01] hallelujah
[1:38:04] hallelujah
[1:38:18] god has a promise
[1:38:20] and he has a time that he'll fulfill it
[1:38:26] you could you can try to figure out all
[1:38:28] the timing of things
[1:38:30] and you can try to pre-plan all these
[1:38:32] things out
[1:38:33] but god's in control of everything
[1:38:38] you think sometimes that ministers put
[1:38:40] these things together or they do things
[1:38:43] just because they can
[1:38:45] but god is behind the scenes
[1:38:47] and he's moving all the pieces of the
[1:38:49] puzzle to make sure that he ain't got
[1:38:51] some cow up in some tree but he's
[1:38:53] working everything out
[1:38:56] you can say well let's look let's just
[1:38:58] make one let's just take one instance
[1:39:00] for a case right here
[1:39:03] brother ron's in an accident
[1:39:06] he's laying there for 17 days in a coma
[1:39:09] 36 hours brain dead
[1:39:12] in the worst condition of his of his
[1:39:14] life at the time
[1:39:17] there's there's children there's a
[1:39:18] church
[1:39:20] that's at stake there's a family at
[1:39:21] stake there's businesses that are at
[1:39:22] stake there's all these things at stake
[1:39:26] fear begins to creep in
[1:39:28] i said what if what if what if what if
[1:39:32] and then there's
[1:39:33] a man that's on the other side
