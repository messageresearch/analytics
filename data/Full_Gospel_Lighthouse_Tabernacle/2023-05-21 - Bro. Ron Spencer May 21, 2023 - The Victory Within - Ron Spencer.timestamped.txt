[17:02] for me
[17:04] um
[17:05] my son is a miracle I prayed for many
[17:08] times
[17:10] I didn't think about this just speak my
[17:11] heart I guess
[17:13] I prayed many times God you can give him
[17:15] a new heart
[17:17] you can do anything
[17:20] towards the time it came
[17:23] appropriate I guess the Lord moving this
[17:26] way for a transplant
[17:28] it just occurred to me
[17:30] as the way I began to speak to my son
[17:33] son
[17:34] none of us know the reasons none of us
[17:37] know the why
[17:39] but there's a testimony
[17:41] beholding of you in the future
[17:44] or somebody that may see you in that
[17:46] hospital was only shortly after that I
[17:48] heard brother Ron
[17:50] speaking of the time he had the stroke
[17:52] and the nurse
[17:54] catching him is praying and the
[17:56] testimony that was
[17:58] there's a reason for all these things I
[18:00] don't know them
[18:01] but he knew them before us
[18:04] my son your son is at home today
[18:07] he has challenges
[18:09] but I know God knows the future I know
[18:12] God has healed him
[18:14] I know with all my heart Marcus the
[18:16] symptoms are there this is that and the
[18:17] other wow he's with us he's
[18:20] fellowshipping
[18:22] while he was in the hospital he drew me
[18:24] close and
[18:26] said dad I don't know the timing and all
[18:29] but
[18:30] you know it's four hours from here he
[18:32] said but

[18:36] my wife and I want my children we're
[18:39] going to make our way up to Full Gospel
[18:42] hopefully
[18:43] couple times a month
[18:46] he didn't have to tell me that I didn't
[18:48] ask him for that
[18:49] but I thank God for his healing power
[18:52] I know he's healed today and I've
[18:55] not sure here

[38:00] Charities graduation yesterday they had
[38:03] it late and
[38:04] and uh so we had a reception at the at
[38:09] Mark's Church at the fellowship hall

[38:13] and so
[38:15] probably 30 35 of us were gathered there
[38:18] and and kind of had a little catered
[38:21] meal and
[38:22] Mark said hey we need to try out the new
[38:24] system that we've got he said would you
[38:27] mind preaching
[38:29] so we just had a spontaneous service
[38:31] they sung for a bit and I preached for a
[38:33] bit and the Lord came down for a bet so
[38:36] amen he'll always show up when he he's
[38:40] not so he's not so concerned about how
[38:43] it is all set up and stuff everywhere
[38:46] you know he just listen he preached on
[38:48] the ship so
[38:50] borrowed a ship and stood there and
[38:51] preached for a while and so yeah he
[38:54] don't mind coming to where we're at so
[38:56] but Mark it's so good to see you here
[38:59] brother Marcus has done such a
[39:00] phenomenal job of keeping
[39:03] brother Donnie and myself in in contact
[39:06] of what's going on with Daniel we we
[39:08] don't say a prayer without calling
[39:10] Daniel's name and and um
[39:14] what a journey that he's been on and so
[39:17] we're we're just praying that God would
[39:19] just completely restore his body I tell
[39:22] you what you don't get a new heart
[39:24] physically and not have some
[39:25] complications and some issues and take a
[39:28] few days to get over it
[39:30] and you sent us a picture the other day
[39:32] he was had got home and he had his
[39:34] little boy in his arms and I tell you
[39:36] what that did me a world of good
[39:39] there's not a hospital in the world
[39:42] that can do for you what your home
[39:45] and your children in your lap can do and
[39:48] so
[39:49] Matthew don't sit in my lap no more but
[39:55] hey man
[39:57] but when my grandbabies call up in my
[39:59] lap that does me a world of good and
[40:02] when Zoe finally crawls up in my lap I'm
[40:04] going to say
[40:08] yeah she she's waving at me when Zoe
[40:10] crawls up in my lap one of these days
[40:12] like she does Alden and
[40:15] some of these uh there's she got my
[40:18] brother's lap yesterday and I thought
[40:19] what is the world is going on here
[40:24] I look like that and
[40:27] we have somewhat the same nature she
[40:29] never gets in my lap and she just went
[40:31] right straight to him and got into
[40:32] Israel happens so
[40:34] amen
[40:36] Marcus I would have really been praying
[40:38] for you and so we know not only is that
[40:41] a deal for Daniel but also for the
[40:43] entire family so
[40:45] amen God bless you we have a wedding
[40:47] here Tuesday and I don't know who all is
[40:50] invited that's not that's above my pay
[40:51] grade but Isaac and Jeannie is getting

[41:08] be here on time and so
[41:12] I knew she was tired last night she let
[41:14] me drive all the way home and so I
[41:17] figured she was right right ready to
[41:18] fall over so
[41:20] she trusts me driving Hallelujah to the
[41:23] lamb and so
[41:25] amen and so we're looking forward to

[41:34] then we're going to move the chairs and
[41:37] we'll get that taken care of and we want
[41:39] to do that right
[41:41] one thing you want to do right
[41:43] is a web and the other ones

[42:15] testing testing one two
[42:18] let me just put it in my pocket and that
[42:20] way maybe it'll do better
[42:22] amen
[42:24] amen we want to pray I I spoke with
[42:28] brother Terry before service and I want
[42:30] to continue to remember him
[42:32] and
[42:34] he lost his foster mother this this week
[42:36] and
[42:37] and they had their funeral there and so
[42:41] the Terry is a real friend of mine and a
[42:43] real buddy
[42:44] and uh
[42:46] if you ever get a chance to hear Brother
[42:47] Terry's story it's a powerful story of
[42:50] predestination and the power of love and
[42:54] the Terry went through a lot of things
[42:56] as a child but God gave him Grace he
[42:58] gave him Brenda
[43:01] amen
[43:03] I mean that I really mean that Brenda's
[43:06] Brenda is an awesome person and so don't
[43:09] you cry on me but Brenda's an awesome
[43:11] person and we love her with all of her
[43:14] hearts and

[44:13] proud of him
[44:14] uh brother William is that brother uh
[44:16] Dales this week in Georgia he's got
[44:19] family there as well and so we pray that
[44:21] God would just bless brother William as

[44:25] our church and so we're so glad that
[44:28] he's able to do that but Andrew is going

[44:50] walls and and they did a lot of things

[44:54] that's actually what they were wanting
[44:55] to do just try out the sound system last

[45:16] Kiger it's not Kiger well I'm going to
[45:19] send you the wrong one
[45:22] it's at Elkton Pentecostal church and so
[45:25] I you know who knows
[45:29] and so
[45:32] am I
[45:34] that's where they had her his Harold's
[45:37] Daddy's funeral yeah
[45:39] I went to that I was a speaker there at
[45:42] that funeral and uh can I share a couple
[45:45] things this morning
[45:46] I just kind of feel this relaxed and so
[45:49] my Sugar's been over 600 this morning so
[45:52] I felt like I've been in a blur all day
[45:54] so I'm coming down so I'm not going to
[45:57] go to sleep on you
[46:00] but at brother Harold's funeral Daddy's
[46:02] funeral brother Homer and I was invited
[46:03] to be speakers there along with about 18
[46:06] other guys and so and so anyway I was
[46:10] sitting beside of the pastor and it was
[46:12] a huge crowd and
[46:14] said it like a minute so
[46:16] so anyway I was sitting beside the
[46:18] pastor and and all of the other
[46:21] ministers that were sitting with us and
[46:23] and I was sitting there and I was
[46:25] looking at all the pastors on the wall
[46:26] that had been there before and
[46:29] I I was looking around at how things
[46:31] were and
[46:32] and
[46:33] the pastor that I knew him and we were I
[46:37] was just chit chatting with him before
[46:39] the funeral and
[46:40] and I looked at The Pianist and
[46:43] I thought about what brother Branham
[46:45] said
[46:46] when that man
[46:48] when that man invited him to to meet his
[46:51] wife and
[46:53] and he called her a saint
[46:55] and brother Branham was just it was one
[46:57] of those truth mornings and brother
[46:59] Branham walked over and shook her hand
[47:01] said I thought you called her a saint
[47:03] she looks like a hand
[47:08] I thought of that and
[47:10] I didn't tell that man the story
[47:15] but I I reminded him that brother
[47:18] Branham actually preached in that pulpit
[47:22] and right here actually brother Brandon
[47:25] spoke right here
[47:26] and then he went to the Armory and spoke
[47:29] brother Brennan would come into an area
[47:31] and maybe speak at a couple of different
[47:33] Pentecostal groups and and then and then
[47:36] he would go to the Armory to speak I I
[47:39] think it was a several days there
[47:41] snowstorm came and
[47:44] and so anyway
[47:47] I just I just said brother Branham spoke
[47:49] here in this Pulpit he kind of just
[47:51] nodded his head yes I said can you
[47:53] imagine this congregation turned down
[47:56] brother Branham because he wore a watch
[48:00] and they called him Whirly
[48:06] and he just kind of set dumbfounded for
[48:09] a bit
[48:10] but if I could have told it the truth
[48:12] just up the road about a mile
[48:17] there's a group of people that still
[48:19] believe his message
[48:25] and we're really proud of that
[48:32] I had an event that happened and and
[48:34] some of some of you haven't heard some
[48:36] of these things and brother Chris was
[48:38] talking to me the other day said won't
[48:40] you share some of those stories so maybe
[48:42] maybe through life I'll just share a
[48:45] story now and then as we come to it
[48:48] I I woke up one morning and this was
[48:50] before Harold's father died several
[48:53] years before he died I woke up in a
[48:55] setup on the bed and I was just sitting
[48:58] there and I saw a vision
[49:00] and then the vision
[49:02] I saw brother Harold's father who was a
[49:04] singer I saw him strum in a guitar
[49:06] standing in the pulpit and I saw him
[49:09] drop with a heart attack
[49:12] and at the same time his mother was
[49:14] sitting back in the audience Mary Betty
[49:17] was sitting in the audience
[49:20] and she falls over with a heart attack
[49:24] I really didn't know what to do with it
[49:26] and the Lord impressed on me to
[49:29] to have lunch with Harold
[49:31] and Harold was a mama's boy a real real
[49:35] lover of his mother and father
[49:38] and so Harold worked with 4 million so
[49:40] it was convenient to do it and I said
[49:42] Harold we'll have dinner together
[49:44] and see we went to dinner and I just
[49:46] kind of I just kind of talked to him for
[49:48] a bit and I said Harold I need to share
[49:50] a story with you
[49:52] I said I I had a vision this morning
[49:55] and I told him exactly what the vision
[49:57] was and I said here's what I want me and
[50:00] you to do I want me and you to pray
[50:02] I don't want you to tell a soul but I
[50:05] want me and you to to pray I told sister
[50:08] Connie I've always want to have a vision
[50:10] I tell Connie and I tell the boys that
[50:13] I've had a vision so that's not you know
[50:15] some people go well I had a vision
[50:18] but they never told nobody so there's no
[50:20] Vindication for it
[50:22] everybody can have a vision after it
[50:24] happens
[50:27] and so as it would be that coming Sunday
[50:30] morning
[50:32] that whole thing happened
[50:34] he uh her his father stepped up in the
[50:38] pulpit and he began to strum the guitar
[50:40] and begin to talk
[50:42] and he fell over with a heart attack and
[50:44] at the same time
[50:46] Mary Betty fell over with a heart attack
[50:50] and they would get them to the hospital
[50:51] and actually Harold's father would code
[50:53] two different times that I know of on
[50:57] the way
[50:58] and so they were able to revive him and
[51:01] and I went to the hospital brother Homer
[51:04] and myself went to the hospital that
[51:05] evening of course the whole family was
[51:07] there Harold had shared this story we
[51:10] knew this was getting ready to happen
[51:11] God had control we had prayer for it
[51:14] before it happened
[51:16] I'll never forget what can you call me
[51:19] his name
[51:20] his name
[51:21] Amos Amos
[51:23] and uh I'm a little blurry this morning
[51:26] so anyway I I I shook his hand in the at
[51:30] the bedside I shook his hand and so I
[51:33] shook his hand and he said you're a
[51:35] prophet I said
[51:36] no but I know one
[51:40] I know one I just I just believe the
[51:43] same message and
[51:45] God just does his gifts and as it would
[51:48] be Mary Betty and Amos would live for
[51:50] many years and and uh and we love them
[51:54] with all of our hearts and cared for
[51:56] them and and so I won't be able to be at
[51:58] their funeral but we just are praying
[52:01] for him she lived 93 years that's quite
[52:03] a it's quite a life and so
[52:06] anything past 70 is your own strength
[52:08] and so once you get past 70 it's your
[52:11] own strength and so we're just praying
[52:13] that that God would just be merciful to
[52:16] them and the family and minister to them
[52:18] and and so many other things
[52:22] amen
[52:24] amen isn't he good to us
[52:28] we just love him with all of our hearts
[52:32] I want to share a I want to share
[52:34] something with you that
[52:36] that was dropped to me this week
[52:40] and it means a lot to me
[52:43] this journey is short
[52:48] an elderly woman got on a bus and sat
[52:50] down
[52:52] and at the next stop a strong
[52:55] grumpy
[52:57] young woman climbed up and sat down
[52:59] beside of the old woman hitting her
[53:04] with a numerous bunch of bags
[53:08] when she saw that elderly woman remained
[53:11] silent the young woman asked her
[53:14] said
[53:16] why she had not complained
[53:18] when she got hit with all of those bats
[53:22] the elderly woman replied with a smile
[53:26] there's no need to be rude
[53:28] or discuss something that's
[53:30] insignificant
[53:32] as my trip
[53:34] next to you is so short
[53:37] because I'm going to get off at the next
[53:40] stop
[53:42] this answer deserves to be written in
[53:44] Gold letters
[53:46] there is no need to discuss something
[53:48] insignificant because our journey
[53:50] together is is too short
[53:54] each of us must understand that our time
[53:57] in this world is so short
[53:59] that darkening it with useless arguments
[54:03] and jealousy
[54:04] and not forgiving others
[54:07] discontentment and bad attitudes are a
[54:11] ridiculous waste of time and energy
[54:15] did anyone break your heart stay calm
[54:19] life is short
[54:21] did someone betray you intimidate or
[54:24] cheat you or humiliate you relax
[54:28] don't be stressed
[54:31] this trip is too short
[54:33] did someone insult you without reason
[54:36] stay calm
[54:38] ignore it I think I'm going to put this
[54:40] on my forehead
[54:45] this trip is too short
[54:48] did a neighbor make a comment that you
[54:50] didn't like
[54:53] stay true stay calm
[54:55] ignore it
[54:57] this trip is too short
[55:01] whatever the problem someone has brought
[55:03] us remember that our journey together is
[55:06] is too short
[55:09] no one knows the length of our trip
[55:12] nobody knows when it will arrive and
[55:15] that it stop
[55:17] our trip together is too short
[55:20] let us appreciate friends and family
[55:24] let us be respectful and kind and
[55:26] forgiving
[55:27] because we will be filled with gratitude
[55:31] and joy after all
[55:34] our trip together is very short
[55:37] share a smile
[55:39] enjoy the day
[55:42] because you trip
[55:44] is way too short
[55:46] amen isn't it good
[55:49] Stonewall Jackson was standing in a
[55:52] Battlefield
[55:54] and at the battle of the American Civil
[55:56] War a general ask Stonewall Jackson
[56:00] how is it that you can keep so cool
[56:03] while the bullets are literally rained
[56:05] down around him
[56:07] and Jackson instantly became grave and
[56:10] earnestly answered
[56:11] my religions and belief teaches me to
[56:15] feel as safe in the battlefield
[56:18] as in my bed
[56:21] God has fixed the time of my death
[56:24] I do not concern myself about that
[56:27] but to be always ready
[56:30] after a pause he added and looked at the
[56:33] questioner in the face that is the way
[56:36] that all men should live
[56:38] and then all would be equally Brave

[57:02] want to make it there's a lot of places
[57:04] that he's not welcome
[57:06] but he's welcome here
[57:17] our nation has tore down his statues and
[57:20] moved them all away I tried to buy one
[57:22] but anyway they've moved them all away
[57:24] and and they don't want anything to do
[57:27] with our ancestors or George Washington
[57:29] but I want to let it be Proclamation
[57:31] today I don't I'm never going to be
[57:34] politically correct
[57:37] but when they raise on Resurrection
[57:39] morning and they need to go to church

[1:00:21] sermons on this and so

[1:00:27] and the same day when the evening was
[1:00:29] come
[1:00:31] he saith unto them
[1:00:33] let us pass over unto the other side
[1:00:38] and when they had
[1:00:40] sent away the multitude
[1:00:43] they took him even as he was in the ship
[1:00:47] and there were also with him other
[1:00:49] little ships
[1:00:51] and there arose a great storm of wind
[1:00:54] and the waves beat into this ship
[1:00:58] and that it was now full
[1:01:01] and it was in the hinder part of the
[1:01:03] ship
[1:01:04] asleep on a pillow
[1:01:07] and they awake him in saith unto him
[1:01:09] master
[1:01:10] cast not
[1:01:12] that we perish
[1:01:14] and he arose and rebuked the wind
[1:01:17] and said unto the sea
[1:01:19] peace
[1:01:21] be still
[1:01:23] and the wind ceased and there was a
[1:01:25] great calm and he saith unto them why
[1:01:28] are you so fearful
[1:01:29] how is it that you have no faith
[1:01:33] and they feared exceedingly and said one
[1:01:36] to another
[1:01:37] what manner of a man is this
[1:01:40] that even the wind
[1:01:42] and the sea
[1:01:43] obey him
[1:01:45] quite a text didn't it
[1:01:47] let's just pray Lord Jesus
[1:01:50] we love you this morning
[1:01:54] Lord even now we feel your presence

[1:02:03] speak to our hearts
[1:02:05] what a wonderful service was here last
[1:02:08] night
[1:02:09] brother Andrew as he delivered the word
[1:02:11] he could just feel the presence of God
[1:02:14] Lord we just ask you now that you touch
[1:02:17] our hearts many needs
[1:02:20] Lord brother Donnie Nicholson that's

[1:02:42] every one of us here have needs
[1:02:44] minister to us now
[1:02:47] in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen you
[1:02:50] can be seated
[1:02:56] First Peter chapter 3 and verse 12.
[1:03:00] the eyes of the Lord
[1:03:02] are on the righteous and the ears are
[1:03:06] open
[1:03:07] to their prayers that's a powerful
[1:03:10] scripture
[1:03:12] it reminds us that no matter how many
[1:03:15] billion people there on the Earth
[1:03:18] your prayer is important
[1:03:25] can we get a hundred percent amens
[1:03:30] in Psalms chapter 68 and verse 1.
[1:03:34] let God arise
[1:03:37] and let his enemies be scattered
[1:03:41] and let them that hate him
[1:03:44] flee before him can we read that
[1:03:47] together
[1:03:49] let God arise and let his enemies be
[1:03:53] scattered
[1:03:54] let them also that hate him flee before
[1:03:59] him
[1:04:01] Allelujah
[1:04:02] perseverance brother Branham says he
[1:04:04] said this poor little woman she had
[1:04:07] never seen him but she had heard of him
[1:04:10] she had many hindrances but her faith
[1:04:13] didn't have any hindrances
[1:04:16] because Faith don't have hindrances at
[1:04:18] all
[1:04:19] you could have a lot of hindrances
[1:04:22] you may have doctor's words
[1:04:25] the scientific man who
[1:04:27] who has examined you it might be that
[1:04:33] that he
[1:04:37] evidently the enemy don't want me to
[1:04:39] preach this
[1:04:41] you may have a lot of hindrances and you
[1:04:43] may have the doctor's words
[1:04:46] the scientific man who has examined you
[1:04:49] it might be that he that man told you
[1:04:54] that you're going to die
[1:04:57] that's all he knows
[1:05:00] that's what he has studied
[1:05:02] his scientific work shows that
[1:05:06] you must die
[1:05:08] your whole system is made up of a a kind
[1:05:11] of way that death death has to strike
[1:05:13] you and there is nothing can keep you
[1:05:16] keep from going on you're going
[1:05:19] now that's as much as he knows no
[1:05:22] science has a medicine for it
[1:05:25] but you have found something
[1:05:27] you pick up a sword and now of course
[1:05:30] you've got a hindrance and you got
[1:05:31] something that's that's going to duel
[1:05:33] against you that devil that disease that
[1:05:36] affliction
[1:05:37] but when you strike the tip of the sword
[1:05:41] with the that devil Yonder it's thus
[1:05:44] saith the Lord and he's revealed it to
[1:05:46] me I am healed
[1:05:51] you see your faith don't have any
[1:05:54] hindrances
[1:05:56] he says in thy seed shall possess the
[1:05:59] gates of their enemy the the greatest
[1:06:01] experiences that I've ever had is to
[1:06:04] come against something that I couldn't
[1:06:06] get over it or under it and just stand
[1:06:08] there and watch God make a way through
[1:06:11] it
[1:06:12] can I can I read that again for you one
[1:06:15] of the greatest experiences I've had is
[1:06:17] to come up against something that I
[1:06:18] couldn't get over
[1:06:20] or under and just stand there and watch
[1:06:23] God make a way through it
[1:06:26] that's the way to do it just move keep
[1:06:29] moving press your nose against it just
[1:06:31] keep moving just keep going on God Will
[1:06:34] Make A Way
[1:06:37] Hallelujah aren't you glad of that this
[1:06:40] morning
[1:06:41] no matter what your situation is God
[1:06:44] Will Make A Way
[1:06:46] it may look dire but God Will Make A Way
[1:06:50] he says this he said but you would you
[1:06:52] you bump into something
[1:06:54] you got a sense of a Feeling
[1:06:57] but not sight you can't see it and all
[1:07:00] at once something somebody have opened
[1:07:04] their eyes and seen a complete different
[1:07:05] world
[1:07:07] they never had seen anything
[1:07:10] and if he and if then you would say well
[1:07:14] now
[1:07:15] that should feel real warmed on you that
[1:07:18] is the Sun what is the sun it's light
[1:07:21] and what it's like
[1:07:23] he he never lived maybe you see you you
[1:07:26] never lived in that state he doesn't
[1:07:27] know anything about it
[1:07:29] that you bump up against there's a
[1:07:31] certain certain thing brother Brahm is
[1:07:33] talking about living in two different
[1:07:34] worlds and and the supernatural World
[1:07:37] being with us and he said well
[1:07:39] well what's that he he never lived in
[1:07:42] that dimension
[1:07:43] it would be a strange thing to him to
[1:07:46] know it
[1:07:49] and he says and I just want to just say
[1:07:51] this and put this right here
[1:07:53] so many times you want to tell somebody
[1:07:55] else Supernatural event
[1:07:58] and they've never had a supernatural
[1:08:00] event in their life
[1:08:02] so it's difficult for them to believe
[1:08:07] or to understand
[1:08:08] or to step into it
[1:08:11] can you imagine a prophet I just shared
[1:08:13] a story with you about Amos and Mary
[1:08:15] Betty seeing a vision sharing it with
[1:08:18] their son then the event happens now
[1:08:20] we're standing here talking about it
[1:08:22] that actually happened
[1:08:25] we actually lived that that that phase
[1:08:28] out brother Branham no doubt stood in
[1:08:30] the Pulpit night after night after night
[1:08:32] and would tell Supernatural events to
[1:08:35] people with a carnal nature
[1:08:37] let me explain to you as carnal
[1:08:40] Believers carnal Believers are people
[1:08:42] that don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:08:45] and so what they will do is they'll come
[1:08:47] to church and so what will happen is
[1:08:49] they it'll be too hot it'll be too cold
[1:08:52] somebody's sitting in their seat
[1:08:54] preacher preaches too long
[1:08:58] why did she wear that why are they here
[1:09:00] why is that
[1:09:04] they don't get anything out of church
[1:09:12] one man's good in the Revival another
[1:09:14] man's
[1:09:16] yeah
[1:09:18] one man's getting in Rapture condition
[1:09:21] one man's getting ready for a
[1:09:22] tribulation
[1:09:25] one man says that's thus saith the Lord
[1:09:27] that's God's Prophet another man says
[1:09:29] he's a heretic
[1:09:33] brother Jeremy's got a couple of
[1:09:35] pictures I want to share with you I'm
[1:09:36] not going to tell you a whole lot about
[1:09:37] him we'll share I want to do that in a
[1:09:39] couple of weeks but
[1:09:41] there's a before picture
[1:09:44] if you can just
[1:09:47] this is what 99 of us see
[1:09:51] brother random is preaching
[1:09:53] we wasn't there but there was a picture
[1:09:55] taken and brother Adam's preaching and
[1:09:58] he's and he's talking about the presence
[1:10:00] of the Lord and
[1:10:02] and so the man the man is listening as
[1:10:05] he's preaching and then well the Graham
[1:10:07] said he's here
[1:10:09] 's the next picture and I want you to
[1:10:12] flip backwards and forwards for a moment
[1:10:20] couple sentences different
[1:10:23] maybe a minute or two different in the
[1:10:25] in the pictures being taken
[1:10:33] how many's ever saw the pillar of fire
[1:10:35] in this building
[1:10:37] yeah
[1:10:39] cloud
[1:10:40] maybe even the angel of the Lord
[1:10:44] so brother Branham is standing there
[1:10:47] is the angel
[1:10:50] in the upper left corner
[1:10:52] there's Christ
[1:10:53] there's the Brazen altar there's the
[1:10:56] licks of fire there's the spirits of God
[1:10:58] flowing down
[1:10:59] same service
[1:11:02] same service
[1:11:04] that's God's prophet
[1:11:07] God's Prophet is standing he's preaching
[1:11:10] the word of God
[1:11:12] listen it doesn't matter verse 52 000
[1:11:14] critics
[1:11:19] are you with me it don't matter
[1:11:23] and there's there's a service going on
[1:11:25] and the lilies are grown in a in a
[1:11:28] supernatural way the pillar of fire is
[1:11:30] just in front
[1:11:32] there's a line of the tribe of Judah
[1:11:35] we'll we'll speak more on that in a
[1:11:37] couple of weeks because I really want
[1:11:38] you to get what's going on here
[1:11:43] I really want you to get what's getting
[1:11:45] on here
[1:11:46] because I'm preaching to two people
[1:11:49] one's going into tribulation period and
[1:11:52] you need to hear what I got to say
[1:11:54] one's going into rapture
[1:11:57] going in a Rapture you need to expect
[1:12:00] you need to expect you need to expect
[1:12:04] the supernatural
[1:12:08] because it's going to be more than in
[1:12:10] this church it's going to be in your
[1:12:11] home
[1:12:12] maybe you're drinking a little coffee
[1:12:14] and all of a sudden you feel a sweet
[1:12:16] come over you
[1:12:19] your hair is different you don't need
[1:12:21] your glasses no more
[1:12:25] somebody walks to your house that you
[1:12:28] haven't seen in decades let them in
[1:12:32] [Applause]
[1:12:36] [Music]
[1:12:44] now that's the phase that we're coming
[1:12:46] to why are we having such Supernatural
[1:12:50] Services it didn't just happen in here
[1:12:53] it is not just happening here it's
[1:12:55] happening around the world
[1:12:57] and what God is doing it's turn the
[1:12:59] corner
[1:13:01] these are the kind of services that
[1:13:03] brother Homer and I would talk about
[1:13:05] it's going to come it's going to come
[1:13:07] it's going to come and brother Homer
[1:13:09] said it's going to come it's going to
[1:13:10] come
[1:13:12] and it's here
[1:13:15] [Applause]
[1:13:20] it's here
[1:13:21] don't take these things for granted
[1:13:37] well now if God lets us live
[1:13:41] we are bodily here in five senses
[1:13:44] but there is another sense
[1:13:47] and then we wake up into that sense and
[1:13:50] that is the sense of vision
[1:13:52] and we see that thing
[1:13:54] that what it is that makes us feel these
[1:13:58] things that we do
[1:14:00] and try to tell somebody about it
[1:14:03] just be like telling a man that never
[1:14:05] did see in his life well he wouldn't
[1:14:08] understand
[1:14:09] because it's not acquainted with that
[1:14:11] sense
[1:14:12] that's the way it is in the gospel
[1:14:17] they don't understand it
[1:14:19] and it's hard for them to see it because
[1:14:22] they've never lived in there
[1:14:25] I know you work with people that don't
[1:14:27] live in this atmosphere
[1:14:32] they don't understand it
[1:14:34] it's hard for them to see it
[1:14:36] because they've never lived there
[1:14:39] they they know nothing about it
[1:14:42] they feel it they can have a reaction to
[1:14:46] it
[1:14:47] but to actually know what it is
[1:14:49] don't
[1:14:51] so when you see beyond that curtain
[1:14:55] where that comes from
[1:14:58] and then try to come back and tell
[1:15:00] people that's only felt it with a sense
[1:15:03] of feeling like and never been able to
[1:15:06] see it it's hard to tell a man
[1:15:09] but you just have to do the best that
[1:15:12] you can
[1:15:14] until we see face to face
[1:15:18] now we see Jesus here
[1:15:21] he's in this boat
[1:15:23] he's tired and weary
[1:15:26] and I can just imagine knowing there's a
[1:15:29] big job at the next day going to
[1:15:31] gonorrhea
[1:15:33] where there was one soul that was
[1:15:35] calling out to for God
[1:15:37] can you imagine Jesus being so weary and
[1:15:41] so tired
[1:15:43] he's been in the meeting and he's
[1:15:45] preached all day long and thousands of
[1:15:47] people have been there
[1:15:48] they've come to see Jesus they've come
[1:15:51] to see Miracles they've come to see this
[1:15:53] that everybody's talking about
[1:15:55] why the priest that preaches is just Dad
[1:15:58] and he he's quoting in in another
[1:16:01] language they really don't understand
[1:16:02] and you know and it's just a historical
[1:16:05] God but this Jesus
[1:16:09] may not be able to fit him all in your
[1:16:11] little box but this Jesus is preaching
[1:16:13] something that's so different
[1:16:16] his atmosphere is so changed it's it's
[1:16:19] like no other man that there's ever been
[1:16:22] have you heard the Miracles have you
[1:16:24] seen the things taking place and it
[1:16:26] would be shared from house to house and
[1:16:29] an expectation would be you know
[1:16:31] wherever Jesus is always good things
[1:16:33] happen
[1:16:39] and Jesus has talked about the sower
[1:16:41] that day
[1:16:43] oh I don't like to been there when he's
[1:16:46] just expounding the scriptures mustard
[1:16:49] seed
[1:16:50] why it's given unto you the most know
[1:16:53] the mysteries of God
[1:16:55] blessed are your eyes for you see
[1:16:57] blessed are for your ears that you hear
[1:17:01] no doubt even while he's preaching
[1:17:03] peoples being healed
[1:17:06] their their bodies are just literally
[1:17:10] being changed and touched and healed
[1:17:12] while they're there
[1:17:14] Jesus is now getting weary it's evening
[1:17:17] time
[1:17:19] and he's come to a spot to wear that now
[1:17:21] that he's got to slip away
[1:17:24] everybody wants to have an audience with
[1:17:26] him or maybe shake his hand
[1:17:29] but those disciples know their
[1:17:30] responsibility is to to get him into a
[1:17:33] boat
[1:17:34] now they got to take care of him because
[1:17:36] everybody wants to touch him because
[1:17:38] they've heard about the woman that
[1:17:39] touched the Hem of His Garment everybody
[1:17:42] wants to touch him and everybody wants
[1:17:44] him to look in their eyes and and you
[1:17:47] know they would be changed everybody
[1:17:49] wants to get near him but they don't
[1:17:51] understand that that one that could
[1:17:54] drive back the Demons of hell and could
[1:17:57] shake your hand and leprosy would leave
[1:17:59] you
[1:18:00] or maybe to Touch the Hem of the Garment
[1:18:02] you'd be well after all those years
[1:18:05] he would get tired
[1:18:07] because it didn't come as God
[1:18:09] he came as man
[1:18:12] and his man he would be weary as a man
[1:18:15] he would get tired
[1:18:17] as a man he would get angry
[1:18:20] he was a man
[1:18:22] oh there would be glimpses that you
[1:18:24] would see that very much deity
[1:18:27] but you see him get tired
[1:18:29] you'd see him Sat on a well and and even
[1:18:34] send you away
[1:18:36] to where you'd go get meat and groceries
[1:18:39] and you knew he had purpose sending you
[1:18:42] away because he's going to a town that
[1:18:44] we didn't think Jesus would go to
[1:18:47] mixed race
[1:18:50] Heathen religion town
[1:18:53] why is there any is there even a
[1:18:55] believer down there why would this great
[1:18:58] Messiah even go there
[1:19:00] and he would go to where that was a well
[1:19:03] and he wouldn't go in the morning or he
[1:19:05] wouldn't go in the evening but he went
[1:19:06] in the middle of the day
[1:19:07] and he said on that well and he was
[1:19:10] waiting on one predestinated seat
[1:19:14] and she all got religious on him Ray she
[1:19:17] got religious
[1:19:20] she got religious on him
[1:19:23] when he began to tell her about the
[1:19:25] Messiah coming
[1:19:27] why are you here
[1:19:29] why are you here in the middle of the
[1:19:31] day she immediately got defensive
[1:19:36] and then he he told her go get your
[1:19:39] husband
[1:19:40] well I have none
[1:19:43] did he miss it oh no
[1:19:46] he said you said right
[1:19:50] but you've had five
[1:19:53] and the one that you're living with he's
[1:19:55] not your husband
[1:19:59] in a moment she began to realize Now
[1:20:02] understand this
[1:20:03] quite an incredible thing
[1:20:06] while in all those other cities he never
[1:20:09] told them that he was a messiah
[1:20:12] he never told him he never revealed
[1:20:14] himself that I'm the Messiah
[1:20:18] but the first one on Earth that he
[1:20:21] revealed that I'm the Messiah was a
[1:20:24] woman that wasn't welcome in any church
[1:20:31] think about that you say my brother Ron
[1:20:33] I have such a stained past he come
[1:20:36] looking for you
[1:20:38] if you'll just stop and give him a drink
[1:20:40] he'll give you a drink of the Living
[1:20:42] Water that you'll never thirst again
[1:20:50] those disciples no doubt watched him as
[1:20:52] he steps off into the boat
[1:20:54] and they can see his unsteadiness as he
[1:20:57] steps
[1:20:58] he's wore out he's sweaty
[1:21:03] he's so tired he can't hardly put one
[1:21:05] foot in front of the other
[1:21:07] and they make a pillow for him
[1:21:10] and get him a place to lay down let me
[1:21:13] just say if I was one of those disciples
[1:21:17] I'd have been patting that pillow I'd
[1:21:18] have made sure that he'd have the best
[1:21:20] place in the world to lay down
[1:21:23] I'd have made sure that he had the best
[1:21:25] blanket available to wrap him up in
[1:21:29] and I'd have stood guard over top of him
[1:21:32] while he sleeped
[1:21:34] that's my respect for the Lord Jesus
[1:21:37] that's also my respect for other
[1:21:39] preachers
[1:21:41] you want to be successful in life is
[1:21:43] have respect
[1:21:45] respect for your teachers respect for
[1:21:47] the authorities
[1:21:49] respect for men of God
[1:21:52] show your children how to have respect
[1:21:54] for men of God
[1:21:56] don't you never talk down to about your
[1:21:59] pastor or your preachers because it's
[1:22:02] those preachers that's got to fight for
[1:22:04] your children one of these days
[1:22:10] and if you got the right kind of
[1:22:12] preacher he'll never give up on you
[1:22:15] maybe a lot of other people will give up
[1:22:17] on you but a right kind of man of God
[1:22:20] well you can go to the ends of the Earth
[1:22:23] but a real man of God will never judge
[1:22:27] you he will never try to throw a stone
[1:22:30] at you he'll be there standing
[1:22:34] he'll be there standing welcome home
[1:22:38] welcome home
[1:22:49] foreign
[1:23:05] he falls asleep quickly
[1:23:14] now they're familiar with their job
[1:23:16] because they were fishermen
[1:23:19] they grabbed those oars
[1:23:21] they've been following him now for a
[1:23:23] while
[1:23:24] but it feels comfortable to have a whole
[1:23:25] to those oars
[1:23:27] and they just start pedaling
[1:23:31] brother Brandon said it was like a
[1:23:33] popcorn meeting
[1:23:35] one after another begin to stand up and
[1:23:37] talk about it
[1:23:39] he's asleep
[1:23:42] but what brought me here
[1:23:46] what made him Messiah to you
[1:23:49] what made him real
[1:23:52] oh
[1:23:54] my my father told me that we would see
[1:23:57] the Messiah
[1:23:59] and the first time I saw him he he
[1:24:01] called me my name
[1:24:03] he didn't know me but he called me by
[1:24:05] name and I recognized
[1:24:07] to him
[1:24:10] I I was there when the woman at the well
[1:24:14] got it
[1:24:17] I'll tell you what did it for me
[1:24:22] you remember the other day when he fed
[1:24:25] those
[1:24:25] fishing loaves
[1:24:28] and we were all tore up with the crowd
[1:24:30] size we couldn't go into town to get
[1:24:32] enough vigils to take care of him
[1:24:34] why we didn't have enough money
[1:24:36] to to give to even go and buy it and the
[1:24:40] town that was nine miles away it was you
[1:24:44] know all those people are here at the
[1:24:46] meeting
[1:24:46] and if we raided every town every every
[1:24:50] house there wouldn't be enough food food
[1:24:52] to feed all these people
[1:24:54] and it was just something about it when
[1:24:56] he began to break that five blows in
[1:25:00] this fish
[1:25:01] and when he began to break them I
[1:25:04] watched it
[1:25:05] David when he broke the bread
[1:25:08] and he pulled it off
[1:25:10] and Brad wreath
[1:25:12] refilled
[1:25:14] I watched it I've given great thought to
[1:25:17] it
[1:25:19] the creator of Heaven
[1:25:22] as he broke the bread
[1:25:25] he didn't have to go get meal
[1:25:28] he didn't have to go get all
[1:25:30] he didn't have to have baking ovens
[1:25:35] he just blessed it
[1:25:38] and when it blessed it multiplied
[1:25:42] and then when the fish was there and he
[1:25:44] tore a little meat off and it just
[1:25:47] replenished itself
[1:25:49] if you'll remember that that fish was
[1:25:51] cooked
[1:25:55] the creator of Heaven could have only
[1:25:58] done that
[1:26:00] that creator
[1:26:02] he didn't have to send us out as parties
[1:26:05] to to have fish
[1:26:07] he didn't have to have it going by but
[1:26:10] he just spoke it
[1:26:13] it reminds me of when he was at a
[1:26:16] wedding
[1:26:18] and they didn't have enough wine
[1:26:21] and it was just water there in those
[1:26:24] barrels
[1:26:25] and and everybody was embarrassed
[1:26:28] because all the city was there at that
[1:26:30] great wedding
[1:26:32] very fitting it would be his first
[1:26:34] miracle and they would ask him to pray
[1:26:38] and when he prayed
[1:26:40] he didn't have to have a great Vineyard
[1:26:43] he didn't have to have great great
[1:26:46] Grinders to grind the grates down and
[1:26:49] time to ferment it he just he just
[1:26:52] blessed it
[1:26:54] it kind of reminds me of the scriptures
[1:26:57] of when he said let there be a son
[1:27:01] and let there be Stars
[1:27:04] and let there be moons brother Branham
[1:27:07] said that white light began to whirl
[1:27:10] and he said he spoke from that great
[1:27:12] white light and he spoke and said let
[1:27:16] there be a son
[1:27:19] and he said God believed his own word
[1:27:23] and the son came into existence
[1:27:27] and when he began to place the planets
[1:27:30] and the Stars he said he would call for
[1:27:33] a like a clinker to fall off of the Sun
[1:27:35] and he would watch it fall for maybe
[1:27:38] million million light years and he'll
[1:27:40] watch it fall and then he would stop it
[1:27:43] in just the right place because God was
[1:27:46] writing his first Bible into heavens
[1:27:49] and he would speak it it wasn't a big
[1:27:51] boom Theory
[1:27:55] it takes some real Faith to believe that
[1:27:57] wouldn't it
[1:28:01] oh brother Ron haven't you heard that
[1:28:03] Big Bang Theory
[1:28:04] yeah you take some faith
[1:28:08] I have to say it takes some real Faith
[1:28:10] to believe that
[1:28:11] for if the moon would get just a few
[1:28:13] inches out of cater
[1:28:16] just a few inches out of cater it would
[1:28:18] flood Florida and Hawaii
[1:28:24] but that Moon hangs there in its right
[1:28:27] spot
[1:28:30] just like all the stars of the heaven
[1:28:33] they hang in the right spot
[1:28:36] every one of them have a meaning
[1:28:39] if you remember Abraham was told that
[1:28:42] you're going to have a son
[1:28:45] brother Wayne said it lasts a couple
[1:28:47] last week he said
[1:28:49] he said God told him
[1:28:51] when it was not so of how it was going
[1:28:54] to be
[1:28:58] and he told him that you're the father
[1:28:59] of Nations
[1:29:01] and if you remember God did two things
[1:29:03] to him he told him about the sand
[1:29:06] can you count it
[1:29:09] that'd be an impossibility he said
[1:29:11] that's your natural seed
[1:29:13] but then he took him to the heavens
[1:29:18] and said look up can you count on
[1:29:21] Abraham
[1:29:23] you're talking about a con conversation
[1:29:25] with god and a man
[1:29:27] can you count on Abraham
[1:29:31] no it's
[1:29:32] possible
[1:29:33] count all this
[1:29:35] you know here
[1:29:37] here so much cloud and so much pollution
[1:29:39] you really can't see the stars quite
[1:29:41] well
[1:29:42] but you go you go out west to where the
[1:29:45] or maybe up north like to Brother
[1:29:47] Kelly's area
[1:29:49] and you go out and there's it's just
[1:29:51] crystal clear
[1:29:52] why it looks like millions of stars
[1:29:56] you can see the Milky Way
[1:30:01] you know one day when in heaven I'd like
[1:30:03] to I'd like to have a day with the Lord
[1:30:06] and I'd like for him to take me and just
[1:30:08] show me how he made it
[1:30:10] Ron would you like to would you like me
[1:30:12] to take you show me how you made it yes
[1:30:15] sir Lord I I'd like I'd like for you to
[1:30:18] just I'd say we won't be alone
[1:30:26] I believe we serve that kind of a god
[1:30:29] brother Ron do you believe that's going
[1:30:30] to kind of be how it is let me just say
[1:30:33] this to you God don't just talk about
[1:30:34] what you're doing here
[1:30:38] I believe that these feet that I have
[1:30:40] will walk on streets of gold
[1:30:43] I believe these hands will one day rub
[1:30:45] dates of pearl
[1:30:47] I believe that one day I'll live in a
[1:30:49] city 1500 miles high
[1:30:52] and it's so divinely architect until all
[1:30:55] you'll feel like you're standing on
[1:30:58] level ground
[1:31:00] God don't just see us here he sees us
[1:31:03] there
[1:31:07] these guys begin to talk about what
[1:31:10] they've seen what they felt no wonder
[1:31:13] people want to come to our meetings
[1:31:17] no wonder people want to come and see
[1:31:19] Jesus operate
[1:31:21] I've seen him do so many things
[1:31:23] do you see the other day when he touched
[1:31:25] that leopard
[1:31:26] did you see the other day when that
[1:31:29] woman screamed unclean did you see the
[1:31:32] other day when all of those events took
[1:31:33] place
[1:31:35] I was standing real close we was at the
[1:31:37] pool the other day
[1:31:39] and all of those sick people that was
[1:31:41] trying to get in the pool and he went to
[1:31:42] one man
[1:31:45] do you see the reaction of those
[1:31:47] Pharisees
[1:31:48] and Jesus just ignored them
[1:31:53] I'd like to stand and say you know I
[1:31:55] like how he does
[1:31:57] he's just so great yet he's so simple
[1:32:01] he's just so great he could have went to
[1:32:05] King's palaces but he came to my house
[1:32:07] to eat
[1:32:15] you know but Satan won't leave you in a
[1:32:18] good meeting
[1:32:20] he won't leave you having great
[1:32:22] testimony service
[1:32:24] he'll remind you of what's got to go on
[1:32:26] Monday
[1:32:28] he'll remind you the troubles that you
[1:32:30] got at home
[1:32:32] no longer matter how long you've been a
[1:32:34] believer
[1:32:35] he'll he'll remind you of the little
[1:32:37] things that you're wrestling with in
[1:32:39] your Humanity
[1:32:41] then as you begin to get older and your
[1:32:43] hair begins to turn gray
[1:32:45] used to be you talked about all the kind
[1:32:47] of work that you did and what your
[1:32:50] hobbies was and how your children were
[1:32:52] growing up and how great your children
[1:32:54] was and and you talked about the
[1:32:56] services after a while you said at a
[1:32:59] table same friends and you talk about
[1:33:01] what the doctor said
[1:33:04] and what kind of medicine that you're
[1:33:06] taking and
[1:33:08] a new herb that's on the scene and
[1:33:11] your bones are aching and your hips are
[1:33:14] aching in your
[1:33:17] I'm gonna have to get a new set of
[1:33:19] glasses I
[1:33:21] Have I Told You Lately That I got a
[1:33:23] tooth that's bothering me
[1:33:25] and before long you know that's your
[1:33:28] atmosphere so Satan don't leave you
[1:33:30] alone
[1:33:32] just because you've been a Christian for
[1:33:34] 65 years don't mean that he leaves you
[1:33:37] alone
[1:33:45] it was a storm came
[1:33:48] mountains were so that to where that
[1:33:50] storms would drop in on that on that sea
[1:33:53] to where that it would be it would just
[1:33:55] happen so quickly
[1:33:57] now these were well-trained men
[1:33:59] they knew how to turn that boat in a
[1:34:01] certain way to to get it right into the
[1:34:03] wave
[1:34:04] now sometimes waves on that sea would
[1:34:07] get 25 to 50 feet tall
[1:34:09] that's pretty intimidating
[1:34:11] you know when you're in a boat you're
[1:34:13] either on the top of the wave or you're
[1:34:15] at the bottom of the wave
[1:34:17] Now understand it's it's real
[1:34:19] intimidating to look at this this
[1:34:23] ceiling is 25 feet tall
[1:34:26] I know
[1:34:28] it's 25 feet tall it takes a tall ladder
[1:34:31] to get to the peak of that roof brother
[1:34:33] Alden it's really tall ladder to get
[1:34:36] there
[1:34:36] you guys Brother Ray you guys have
[1:34:38] worked up there it's tall way I have to
[1:34:41] be honest with you I don't like water if
[1:34:43] it's this high
[1:34:47] but when a seeds that big
[1:34:50] it's kind of like Satan's stocking the
[1:34:52] odds against you
[1:34:56] you know a lot of people are so great
[1:34:58] because they tell you that
[1:35:03] a lot of people are so big all they need
[1:35:05] somebody to take a PIN to them
[1:35:09] let a little air out
[1:35:14] foreign
[1:35:16] Harold Hildebrandt would say you know
[1:35:17] how we know he's great he told us he was
[1:35:25] I cannot imagine those waves being so
[1:35:27] high
[1:35:29] it seemed like the devil was in those
[1:35:31] waves
[1:35:32] not just natural ways but it seemed like
[1:35:35] that Satan had swore
[1:35:38] he's weak and he's tired
[1:35:41] and I've had enough with him
[1:35:44] now let me just say sometimes our storms
[1:35:46] are worse or maybe worse in our mind
[1:35:50] than they are in reality
[1:35:55] can I can I just give you a glimpse here
[1:35:59] those ways were so high and so rough
[1:36:02] but Jesus was still asleep
[1:36:07] so the water hadn't got to him
[1:36:12] or he would have been awake
[1:36:15] are you with me now
[1:36:16] so the waves to Peter and those guys
[1:36:20] was much worse
[1:36:24] than in reality are you with me now
[1:36:28] like
[1:36:29] and they they were so scared and so
[1:36:32] afraid and I'd have been right with them
[1:36:36] every one of you that are so brave
[1:36:38] sitting on these dry pews
[1:36:40] they just put you in that little bottle
[1:36:43] stopper of a ship
[1:36:45] and let Satan be swearing I'm going to
[1:36:48] destroy you I know where I'm talking
[1:36:50] about right now
[1:36:52] and he's breathing down and he's he's
[1:36:54] saying I'm going to destroy you this
[1:36:56] night this is the last night that I'm
[1:36:58] going but remember Jesus said let us go
[1:37:01] to the other side if you can just pay
[1:37:03] attention to his words
[1:37:04] [Applause]
[1:37:05] if you can just pay attention to his
[1:37:08] words we're gonna make it
[1:37:11] we're gonna make it I know there's a
[1:37:13] storm coming I'm going to sleep through
[1:37:16] it
[1:37:17] I need the rest we're going to get
[1:37:20] through the storm we're gonna make it to
[1:37:23] the other side
[1:37:26] [Applause]
[1:37:30] you out of bounds brother Ron
[1:37:32] if you trust me
[1:37:35] I'll use you like never before had he
[1:37:39] never said that to me I'd be a bag of
[1:37:42] nerves sitting here today
[1:37:44] but he spoke it to me
[1:37:48] [Applause]
[1:37:52] will run by the minute task God's
[1:37:54] counted you worthy to go through it
[1:37:58] don't fail to get it God has counted you
[1:38:00] Worthy to go through the test
[1:38:07] brother Brown says this he said
[1:38:09] when you have a trial or a test
[1:38:12] it shows the grace of God
[1:38:14] has found
[1:38:16] favor
[1:38:19] you have found favor with God
[1:38:25] I want that to sink in
[1:38:29] and God believes
[1:38:31] you'll stand the test
[1:38:36] notice brother Branham didn't say
[1:38:38] if you believe
[1:38:40] you'll stand the test there's a major
[1:38:42] difference here
[1:38:44] brother Doug there's a major difference
[1:38:45] here when When God says I believe
[1:38:50] that what I put in you
[1:38:52] will get you through your test
[1:38:55] it's not what you believe about it
[1:38:59] why are you saying that brother Ron
[1:39:01] because there'll be a lot of days on
[1:39:02] your Monday morning blues
[1:39:05] there's going to be things come out of
[1:39:07] your stinking mouth
[1:39:10] that's got to be careful what you
[1:39:12] confess because you can
[1:39:14] drive your faith Away by your doubt and
[1:39:17] by your negative words
[1:39:20] help me preach
[1:39:22] help me preach but if you can get the
[1:39:25] word coming out of your mouth
[1:39:27] with a positive confession I'm going to
[1:39:31] have a son I'm going to be the father of
[1:39:33] many nations
[1:39:35] Sarah you're going to have a son
[1:39:37] it's going to come through you are you
[1:39:39] with me now
[1:39:48] they finally come to a point to where
[1:39:50] they had forgot Jesus was in the boat
[1:39:53] listen there's a lot of times where we
[1:39:55] get into a problem when we forget who's
[1:39:57] with us
[1:40:00] Mary and Joseph forgot
[1:40:03] they've forgotten left Jesus brother
[1:40:05] Brown said that's what's happened to the
[1:40:07] church World they went off without Jesus
[1:40:10] that's why they have to have politics
[1:40:12] that's why they have to have all
[1:40:14] different kind of programs they went off
[1:40:16] without Jesus I'm glad God sent us a
[1:40:19] message that is Jesus
[1:40:28] finally they realize Jesus is in the
[1:40:30] boat
[1:40:33] and they and they
[1:40:36] went to him and said
[1:40:38] notice these words
[1:40:40] Karis not
[1:40:42] that we perish listen there's never a
[1:40:45] time that Jesus don't care for you
[1:40:50] there's never been a time that Jesus
[1:40:54] don't care then why would those words
[1:40:56] come out of their mouth an enemy
[1:41:00] an enemy well brother Ron I I was I'm
[1:41:03] not one of those disciples okay okay I'm
[1:41:05] gonna bring it to you
[1:41:07] brother Ron don't care
[1:41:11] the preachers they don't care
[1:41:14] well they haven't shook my hand in
[1:41:16] Forever
[1:41:19] he ain't told me listen you can't say
[1:41:22] this he ain't told me that he loved me
[1:41:31] listen I tell sister Connie I love her
[1:41:33] more than I've ever loved it before I
[1:41:35] tell her that multiple times a day
[1:41:38] for you that's having marriage trouble
[1:41:39] I'm gonna give you some tips here

[1:41:44] you more than I've ever loved you before

[1:41:56] in a robe I tell her how beautiful she
[1:41:59] is

[1:42:26] cares not that we perish
[1:42:29] we're going to die here
[1:42:31] 's not that we perish this trial is too
[1:42:35] great
[1:42:36] we're not going to live through it
[1:42:41] Jesus got up
[1:42:44] and he walked to the bow of the boat
[1:42:48] he didn't have a prayer meeting
[1:42:53] he looked at the storm
[1:42:55] and he said Peace
[1:42:59] be still
[1:43:09] peace
[1:43:13] of all of these sermons
[1:43:14] he just uses this this word
[1:43:18] peace
[1:43:19] because in that storm the devil was
[1:43:26] in your storm the devil is
[1:43:31] I don't care what your storm is this

[1:46:42] about your dog
[1:46:45] [Music]
[1:46:49] somebody told me one time said if you'd
[1:46:51] quit preaching so long I wouldn't have
[1:46:53] to have my dog in the kennel
[1:46:56] if you love your dog more than God you
[1:46:58] need to get rid of that dog
[1:47:03] [Applause]
[1:47:14] I'm sorry I haven't got off of page two
[1:47:16] here yet
[1:47:21] I got a letter this week at the end of
[1:47:23] the letter they said they wanted to
[1:47:24] write my life story
[1:47:26] I don't know these people
[1:47:28] I don't know how you write somebody
[1:47:30] else's life story but you don't even
[1:47:31] know
[1:47:34] I told the boys I said you know I don't
[1:47:37] want nobody writing a life story we only
[1:47:39] halfway through
[1:47:54] you can't put the last chapter in the
[1:47:56] middle of the book
[1:48:02] I'm impressed somebody wants to write it
[1:48:03] it must be something that somebody
[1:48:05] enjoys but hey I ain't done
[1:48:14] you know Jesus didn't turn it around and
[1:48:17] tell those disciples you're full of the
[1:48:19] devil that's the reason you don't have
[1:48:20] no faith
[1:48:24] you know it's in those moments that you
[1:48:27] think God's going to whip me
[1:48:33] he tells us we need more faith
[1:48:37] but it reminds us
[1:48:40] that the victory
[1:48:42] is in you
[1:48:46] now he reminds us that we've got all the
[1:48:48] equipment we need
[1:48:50] to speak to the storm
[1:48:53] you didn't have to wake me up you could
[1:48:55] have did this job
[1:48:57] I preaching to you yeah
[1:49:01] I gotta I gotta call the preacher and
[1:49:03] get him to pray immediately wait a
[1:49:04] minute just before you call the preacher
[1:49:06] I don't mind you calling me I don't mind
[1:49:08] you texting me
[1:49:10] I'm talking to you guys here now
[1:49:13] I don't mind you calling me I don't mind
[1:49:15] you texting me
[1:49:17] I got a call this week and this guy's
[1:49:20] talking to me and
[1:49:22] he said well brother Ron he said only
[1:49:24] thing I know is it's probably sin in
[1:49:26] your life while that cancer hasn't left
[1:49:32] yeah I blocked his number
[1:49:41] but you know
[1:49:45] you know if Peter would have only
[1:49:46] realized
[1:49:48] Jesus told us was going to get to the
[1:49:50] other side
[1:49:52] he told us he's got a plan we're going
[1:49:55] to Galleria I don't know what's going to
[1:49:57] go on but there's Legion
[1:50:00] there
[1:50:01] and he's going to get well
[1:50:03] and there's people that are going to be
[1:50:04] touched as he leaves the tombs
[1:50:06] whole political system is going to get
[1:50:08] upside down and all the priests are
[1:50:10] going to get mad and there's a hog
[1:50:12] farmer that's going to lose all of his
[1:50:14] picks
[1:50:18] Haven don't you get mad now
[1:50:20] don't get mad because
[1:50:23] Jesus cast those Devils into pigs
[1:50:25] there's good pigs
[1:50:29] a little Haven back there two two three
[1:50:32] she's three she's three she loves pigs
[1:50:35] just remind her in Charlotte's Web
[1:50:38] there's a good pig
[1:50:52] and one night I'll preach on washing a
[1:50:55] pig
[1:50:59] I'll preach on washing a pig she's
[1:51:01] waving at me now
[1:51:04] but always remember if you don't get a
[1:51:06] lamb nature on your pig
[1:51:08] you go right back to the slop
[1:51:13] now
[1:51:15] you say well brother Ron the victory was
[1:51:17] within he could have spoke to the storm
[1:51:19] you remember the same guy that's scared
[1:51:22] of the storm
[1:51:23] in only just a short time is going to go
[1:51:26] by the a man that is lame all of his
[1:51:29] life
[1:51:31] and I want you to just notice he don't
[1:51:32] take him to church
[1:51:36] he don't take him to a hospital but he
[1:51:38] said such as I have give I Thee in the
[1:51:42] name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk
[1:51:46] the victory was Within
[1:51:50] sometimes your storms reveal the true
[1:51:54] Victory that's on the inside of you so
[1:51:57] God has to send the storm to push that
[1:52:02] character out of you
[1:52:06] Hallelujah because God knows it's in
[1:52:09] there
[1:52:11] never stop believing never turn around
[1:52:14] and run never be a coward
[1:52:17] strong
[1:52:19] and see the salvation of the lord we are
[1:52:23] winners we are winners we are winners
[1:52:47] I may be getting wet from the storm but
[1:52:50] I'm a winner
[1:52:52] because I got Jesus in my boat
[1:52:57] he's in my boat
[1:52:59] don't you worry
[1:53:03] all I got to do is call Jesus on the
[1:53:05] scene
[1:53:10] you can tell Daniel that Jesus is in his
[1:53:12] boat
[1:53:14] is in his boat
[1:53:17] brother Donnie Nicholson he's in your
[1:53:19] boat
[1:53:21] may seem tough but he's in your boat
[1:53:24] Erica Reagan he's in your boat
[1:53:28] he's in your boat
[1:53:29] you know the doctors may be telling her
[1:53:32] some really difficult things
[1:53:33] that's for the family to tell but let me
[1:53:36] just say he's in her boat
[1:53:40] and if if you forget that God don't
[1:53:42] still do
[1:53:43] with Iran will be preaching
[1:53:46] next Sunday morning
[1:53:49] because Jesus is in the boat
[1:54:04] won't you tell your children right there
[1:54:06] where you're standing
[1:54:07] you got small children once you tell
[1:54:09] them

[1:54:22] we'll see you going in and out in now
[1:54:26] it'd be a great thing
[1:54:27] [Music]
[1:54:29] it's going to be times when that baby's
[1:54:31] got a fever
[1:54:32] a baby's sick
[1:54:34] and you'll pray
[1:54:37] you may not call me but you'll pray
[1:54:41] and you'll remember what it was like for
[1:54:43] your mother to pray for you when you was
[1:54:45] a sick baby
[1:54:47] your mother trusted God
[1:54:51] now it's your turn
[1:54:53] your turn to trust the Lord
[1:54:56] aren't you glad
[1:54:59] that he's that kind of a personal God to
[1:55:01] you

[1:55:07] sister Nancy was being chased around to
[1:55:09] church
[1:55:11] I was a guy that wanted to kiss her
[1:55:15] [Music]
[1:55:22] looks back a long time ago now but in
[1:55:24] the span of life
[1:55:26] life is short
[1:55:30] now Sister Nancy sees a lot of people in
[1:55:32] this church
[1:55:34] she never knew she was going to be a
[1:55:35] preacher's wife
[1:55:37] she never knew that her husband's going
[1:55:39] to be a pastor
[1:55:41] we celebrate 50 years
[1:55:44] this year
[1:55:45] many of you don't know those Original
[1:55:47] Stories
[1:55:49] but you see Jesus has been in our boat a
[1:55:51] long time
[1:55:52] [Music]
[1:55:53] we've had some real storms
[1:55:57] there's been some rocky times
[1:55:59] there's been some times where I stayed
[1:56:01] up all night and prayed
[1:56:03] on my knees
[1:56:04] feeling so alone
[1:56:07] some of your needs
[1:56:09] took me to my knees
[1:56:11] and I stayed there and prayed a long
[1:56:13] time
[1:56:14] [Music]
[1:56:17] but I want to remind you no matter your

[1:56:42] presence of the Lord
[1:56:43] the people saw the pillar of fire in
[1:56:45] this building
[1:56:46] even unbelievers saw those flowers just
[1:56:49] opened in the presence of the Lord
[1:56:52] that happened at sister Karen Pruitt's
[1:56:54] funeral
