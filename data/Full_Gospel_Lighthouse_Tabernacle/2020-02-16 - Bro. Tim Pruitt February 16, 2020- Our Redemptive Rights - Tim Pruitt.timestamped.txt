[0:52] that I would visit him Lord when we

[9:10] announce our common goal and our mission
[9:13] of the Bride of Christ and I have some
[9:17] very very important things to say to you
[9:20] tonight as I believe that God has
[9:23] orchestrated this moment and some of the
[9:27] things that I will say comes as a result
[9:30] of I just celebrated on February the
[9:34] first fifty years of ministry and no I
[9:38] don't look that old I don't even look 50
[9:40] I know but I've had 50 50 years of
[9:44] ministry now and and but you know here
[9:48] we are in this day and this time and
[9:51] this hour and and so as I speak tonight
[9:55] I'll speak from many years of experience
[9:58] and things that as I've seen as we've
[10:01] gone along now as I said I came here on
[10:04] a mission
[10:05] I came here at Thursday um and I'd been
[10:09] feeling like I should come for some
[10:11] weeks ever since we've heard the news
[10:15] back in the 1st of January and I was
[10:21] seeking the Lord for the right time to
[10:24] come you know as many of you know that
[10:27] we had had plans to go to Japan we have
[10:30] we have a church there that we was able
[10:35] to our church was able to send
[10:37] missionaries there and established a
[10:40] church in Japan they now have a pastor a
[10:44] group of people gathering together there
[10:47] of them from you know different
[10:50] nationalities really but Japanese also
[10:53] we're currently translating the message
[10:57] into the Japanese language and getting
[11:00] them on the message hub that brother
[11:02] Bisco sponsors him in his church so
[11:05] anybody in the world that speaks
[11:06] Japanese can go to the message hub and
[11:09] be able to read those sermons and the
[11:13] Japanese language and then of course I
[11:16] was to go on go to the Philippines for
[11:20] some ministers meeting and this was to
[11:23] happen Tuesday so I didn't know when or
[11:27] how it would work out and so I was just
[11:29] looking for the right time and my son
[11:34] Timothy if you remain OTT remember but
[11:38] twelve years ago when I I began to talk
[11:43] to him about coming to see brother Ron
[11:46] and I I was saying you know I really
[11:49] feel unheard to go and I don't I don't
[11:53] know I'm not getting the news correctly
[11:55] I mean I don't understand what's going
[11:57] on and I'm really really burdened about
[12:01] it and I had spent several days and my
[12:04] son just under inspirations and dad go
[12:07] today and I said today he said yeah go
[12:12] today and I said well you know we have a
[12:14] farm and I have was in the middle of
[12:16] chores and I said I've got
[12:18] and it shows up I just can't walk out of
[12:20] the barn and the Mesa will take care of
[12:23] everything you go pack and so we got in
[12:26] the car we drove here all the way up
[12:29] into Tennessee picked up the journey the
[12:31] next day got here and of course I'm you
[12:35] you know the rest of the story God moved
[12:38] on the scene what we were here and and
[12:41] answered our prayers and the bludgeons
[12:44] my prayers but the prayers of thousands
[12:46] around the world your prayers and we
[12:51] just seen the Holy Spirit move in a
[12:53] tremendous way as I prayed it and asked
[12:56] the Lord I said God don't let me I don't
[12:59] want to leave here without being able to
[13:01] talk to my friend and so I'm looking for
[13:05] something that miraculous to happen and
[13:07] that that day we walked into the
[13:10] hospital and as I come into the area I
[13:13] heard him talking I said praise God amen
[13:16] you're doing the work amen and we saw
[13:19] him from there and the Holy Spirit doing
[13:23] a work of course you know the process of
[13:25] healing and things that went on for
[13:28] sometimes actually probably six months a
[13:31] year or more and then the kinetic rate
[13:34] healing that took place and brother
[13:36] bisko's meeting you remember and so you
[13:39] don't mind that talk to you a minute all
[13:42] right well good because that's what I'm
[13:43] gonna do anyway
[13:45] but you know we we as I was praying
[13:51] about it and brother Timothy was coming
[13:53] down the highway he was coming from
[13:56] Missouri where he just preached a
[13:58] meeting there and saw the Lord do some
[14:01] wonderful things and and there as he was
[14:04] thinking about different things he gave
[14:07] me a colonies at dad it's time for you
[14:09] to go to see brother Ron and I said you
[14:13] think so I said well I've been praying
[14:16] about it no he said dad it's the time
[14:18] and I said okay I'll I'll pray about it
[14:22] some more so I prayed about it and as I
[14:25] prayed the Lord confirmed it with me
[14:27] nothing short of a miracle I was able to
[14:30] get plane tickets for me and my wife to
[14:33] get a flight to Charlottesville and I
[14:36] really appreciate your support sister
[14:38] Karen it meant your encouragement your
[14:41] strength to me she's a wonderful wife
[14:43] she's been a part of this ministry for
[14:45] 45 years old and so I really love and
[14:48] appreciate her very much a man and but I
[14:52] didn't know if we could surprise brother
[14:55] Ron because you know I had an old aunt
[14:57] that was a Pentecostal aunt Dadson
[15:01] aunt Exley's is a great aunt she was way
[15:05] up in age and we drove 6 7 hours down to
[15:09] beit el in texas one time to see her
[15:12] didn't tell her we were coming just was
[15:15] just gonna show up and and you know she
[15:18] greeted us at the door and said come on
[15:21] e and i got dinner fixed the Lord woke
[15:23] me up this morning said honey child
[15:25] you've got family coming today get ready
[15:30] [Music]
[15:31] [Applause]
[15:35] [Music]
[15:38] I said well knowing brother Ron I may
[15:43] not sleep either hand on him and sure
[15:45] enough he had told brother brother
[15:47] Andrew he said I just feel like some of
[15:49] my friends are fixing to come see me
[15:51] amen but he he had no he had no clue you
[15:55] know next thing I'm hearing from John
[15:58] andis I hear you've gone to brother
[15:59] Ron's and then I hear from then I hear
[16:02] from Japan you're going to brother Ron's
[16:04] and I'm here and so how does all these
[16:07] people know what I'm doing and so you
[16:11] know India knows and Japan knows and
[16:15] ending up in Cloverdale nose and
[16:18] different but other on don't know that
[16:21] we're coming and so we were able to go
[16:24] into the airport terror and as we landed
[16:28] and brother brother wrong sister Connie
[16:33] Metis Terry didn't know who was coming
[16:35] and but it was a very emotional moment
[16:39] you know brother Ron's had some weeks of
[16:42] bad news and doctors reports and and of
[16:45] course I've been on top of everything
[16:48] but um I felt I needed to obey the word
[16:52] and do like I said last night when God
[16:54] spoke to me about brother Kenneth and
[16:57] said I've already done my part
[16:59] what are you gonna do about it so you
[17:02] know this is response to that I've been
[17:04] commissioned and so have you
[17:06] and every other believer in God was only
[17:09] reminded me of the Commission I did my
[17:12] part I went to Calvary I paid the price
[17:14] you go and apply it so you know when we
[17:18] heard the news of his diagnosis but the
[17:21] Donny Reagan had text me about it and
[17:24] communicating with me about it I just
[17:26] said why don't you just meet me here and
[17:28] we'll double up on the devil and so we
[17:31] we went from the airport where brother
[17:33] Donny sister Carol were waiting on the
[17:35] inside and brother Ron's house and and
[17:39] you know I thought it was very wonderful
[17:43] as we as we talked and
[17:46] you know we was brother Donnie was gonna
[17:48] be here Friday all day and I didn't know
[17:52] how everything would not be unfun fold
[17:54] but brother Ron wanted prayer right now
[17:56] you know right now and you know it was
[18:00] unlike Pharaoh who wanted another night
[18:02] with the frogs you know he wanted threat
[18:04] right now well you know so since he
[18:08] wanted prayer right now I had to preach
[18:11] in a little bit so you know I began to
[18:15] because I wanted an atmosphere you don't
[18:20] understand sometimes what how important
[18:23] an atmosphere is was in the right
[18:27] atmosphere things can happen that's why
[18:31] it's gonna be really important that you
[18:33] work on your atmosphere in this church
[18:37] and every service come with an
[18:39] expectation of faith and believe in that
[18:43] God's going to do some great things
[18:47] amen now so you know um I had brother
[18:52] Donnie and I began to talk to divine
[18:54] healing and deliverance and just I just
[18:57] want to make something very clear that
[18:59] this this what is happening is not from
[19:04] God it is the depth sickness does not
[19:11] come from God sicknesses of the depth
[19:15] and it's common to humanity because of
[19:21] Adam's sin selling us and sent into
[19:24] slavery where everyone are subject to
[19:28] sickness and if you ain't had it well
[19:32] you will at some point in time in your
[19:34] life amen and you say well I don't see
[19:38] any need for praying and then these
[19:40] prayer lines and praying well you just
[19:42] never been sick enough yes
[19:45] [Applause]
[19:47] you get sick enough you believe in
[19:50] divine healer and then you you'll be
[19:54] seeking for somebody with that can pray
[19:56] a prayer of faith we had a man up in
[19:59] Arkansas when brother Ron and I was back
[20:01] in June brother Jason Jackson's we had a
[20:04] man in Arkansas that um that was that
[20:08] was actually came to the meeting because
[20:11] he was invited he had met with a man who
[20:15] does body work and he's quite a little
[20:17] witness and began to talk about the Lord
[20:20] and he said well man I've I've got stage
[20:22] 4 cancer and I've been to two churches
[20:25] and they won't pray for me because they
[20:27] said we don't do that we don't we don't
[20:29] do that we don't pray for the sick you
[20:32] know because a lot of them don't don't
[20:35] believe that it's God's will to heal and
[20:38] and they don't believe God does that
[20:41] anymore and so he said you know I can't
[20:45] find a church she'll pray for me said
[20:47] we'll come to our church tonight we're
[20:49] having special services and we believe
[20:51] in praying for the sick and and of
[20:54] course during that course of the service
[20:56] the Lord come and moved and and we it
[21:00] was prayer there was many miracles that
[21:02] took place and you probably have heard
[21:04] some of this already but but anyway this
[21:07] man has just recently reported that he's
[21:10] cancer free and healed the doctor said
[21:14] no need to even come back
[21:19] amen
[21:22] [Music]
[21:24] so I began to talk to divine healing and
[21:27] deliverance and how God had delivered
[21:30] those who were dying I've been in times
[21:32] where people were dying and right
[21:35] brother on himself when he was dying
[21:36] from the burns you know and I I was
[21:40] there in that moment and sing God move
[21:43] on the singing and you know and and and
[21:47] I began to speak about the will of God
[21:50] to be healed and the ladies were the
[21:52] adjoining room they came in as we were
[21:54] about to pray and the Holy Spirit came
[21:57] down and anointed us and we prayed and
[22:00] we curse that demon of cancer and then
[22:06] for his immune system to be activated to
[22:09] seek out and destroy this cancer and
[22:12] brother Donnie began to interceding in
[22:16] the spirit and hands and tongues from a
[22:20] heavenly language began to flow out of
[22:23] his mouth for seven or ten minutes and
[22:25] we were charged by the Holy Ghost and
[22:29] demanded that evil spirit of cancer to
[22:31] leave his body I want you to know it was
[22:33] a powerful and anointed moment and as I
[22:38] concluded in prayer I looked up and I
[22:41] saw the word Shalom's written over the
[22:44] door of his office and I thought of a
[22:46] little sister Shalom in India who is
[22:49] also struggling with cancer and she is
[22:52] contacted me and of Senator prayer cloth
[22:54] and and and I began to pray for her also
[22:57] because I saw her name up there and it
[23:00] just slightly just real quietly I was
[23:03] praying for her and then the Holy Spirit
[23:05] began to move and the word Shalom
[23:08] meaning peace and I began to speak peace
[23:13] peace peace peace peace peace Lord your
[23:21] peace and the Spirit of torment wasn't
[23:25] fear it was a spirit of oppression that
[23:28] has been haunting brother wrong for
[23:29] weeks left him right there
[23:32] a balloon
[23:34] [Music]
[23:44] today is felt better than ever and we
[23:46] believe he's healed but that doesn't
[23:48] mean we he won't have another battle but
[23:50] rather healing is a process once you'd
[23:55] understand healing is a process a man a
[23:58] miracle you know it just snapped right
[24:01] out of it but you know and never have
[24:03] another issue but healing is a process
[24:06] God promises he does give miracles but
[24:09] he promises healing and just speaking
[24:14] about that that our peace I I just want
[24:18] to tell you about a situation that
[24:21] happened at youth camp and we we had
[24:24] more demons that has attacked our young
[24:27] people and we had we had major during
[24:32] that time of that weekend we had we had
[24:35] over 10 different demonic manifestations
[24:40] of demons that we dealt with it that
[24:43] youth camping and then the after service
[24:48] on Sunday and just seeing it and I just
[24:52] want to testify of all of them we didn't
[24:54] have a one without a victory not a
[24:58] without a bit but when you know we had a
[25:02] long prayer line that night and I prayed
[25:04] till the last person came through and I
[25:07] was uh I was we had prayed for nearly
[25:11] 400 people or more there's close to 900
[25:14] or more people come to the youth camp
[25:17] and as in our services we've had that
[25:20] camp since 1987 and so for 30 30
[25:26] something years now and but you know
[25:29] it's one very large meeting we had
[25:33] nearly 400 or over in the prayer line
[25:36] that we prayed for lay hands on and
[25:38] believed and saying God come on the
[25:41] scene and bring deliverance and and so
[25:46] when we as I speak about this it was a
[25:50] young man that after I turned around
[25:54] looked over to audience now and of
[25:57] course I'm exhausted after prayin for so
[26:00] many people and I'm standing there just
[26:02] kind of in a daze looking out and I
[26:05] notice there's a crowd of young people
[26:07] and others some counselors and others or
[26:10] over a young boy that has and I look and
[26:14] I'm watching it and seeing what what is
[26:17] going on here and and and I see it's
[26:21] another demonic manifestation that as
[26:24] they passed him through the line some of
[26:26] them just grabbed him and took him out
[26:28] and and put him down at the altar and
[26:31] then it began to manifest and so here we
[26:34] yeah and I look in I said oh I've still
[26:38] got another one to deal with and so I'm
[26:41] standing there looking what I do you
[26:44] know I'm watching and I'm seeing and I I
[26:48] don't say that I prove of all of this
[26:50] but this is what was going on that that
[26:54] you know they they were demonstrated and
[26:58] young people could bind the devil and he
[27:01] couldn't speak and they were doing it
[27:03] and then have shown him pictures of
[27:05] brother Branham of the pillar of fire
[27:07] and who is this and and and he would
[27:11] react and do and whatever yeah and then
[27:14] they would you know put a Bible on him
[27:17] and you don't know nothing worked to
[27:19] cast out the devil and and so finally
[27:26] they made away from me and I got down
[27:30] there and I just locked my eyes to his
[27:36] eyes and I looked deep into his eyes and
[27:42] I looked and from my soul and projected
[27:45] and I began to speak peace peace peace
[27:52] peace
[27:54] and I said it about the seventh time and
[27:58] when I did it left him and the boy said
[28:05] I'm free I'm free
[28:07] it's gone I'm free now let me just tell
[28:12] me if we can cast out demons out of a
[28:16] personal spirit we can cast him out of a
[28:18] body are you with me
[28:23] amen and that's all that a cancer is it
[28:26] is a evil spirit and by his word we cast
[28:31] him out Jesus did it by the word brother
[28:35] Branham did it by the word he spoke to
[28:37] them and expected them to do what he
[28:40] said because he was commissioned to use
[28:42] the name their way you know as we said
[28:47] you know when we were praying for
[28:48] brother Ron there we we and the Holy
[28:52] Spirit came in the room we know what
[28:55] happens when God comes in the room we
[28:58] sing this before he comes to heal he
[29:00] comes to deliver he comes to win he
[29:03] never loses so you know what should we
[29:07] say to this thing that has attacked the
[29:10] you at this church and your pastor here
[29:13] what shall we say well I've got just one
[29:16] question that I want you to answer and
[29:19] that is is there anything too hard for
[29:23] the Lord amen so we have overwhelming
[29:29] evidence that God is with us so who then
[29:33] can be against us so we hear a prophet
[29:38] saying and he sees her people come in at
[29:40] the end time and he says Satan be
[29:42] careful because there's a people that
[29:46] know their God that'll do exploits a man
[29:49] now just to tell you a little something
[29:52] here at the same time we're praying
[29:54] brother Jason Jackson is in his office
[29:57] at home he he knows nothing about our
[29:59] visit here or that we're praying or the
[30:02] time we're praying
[30:04] that moment the Lord speaks to him and
[30:05] he writes a note he puts a date
[30:07] he puts a time and it's the same time of
[30:11] our prayer and his note says is a
[30:14] message to brother Ron says brother Ron
[30:16] fear not
[30:17] don't doubt I have not forgotten my
[30:19] promise to you if you trust me I'll use
[30:22] you like never before
[30:23] [Applause]

[34:14] philosopher and always shared you must
[34:17] have scientific evidence to prove
[34:19] anything
[34:20] the disinterred dissertation
[34:23] dissertation for English literature have
[34:26] already been accepted I was very
[34:28] thankful we had your in review on Monday
[34:33] and Tuesday I shared that on the dick
[34:36] tree too many opinions the supernatural
[34:38] occurred several times in history
[34:41] without scientific understanding
[34:44] sister Angela used several examples in
[34:48] the Bible knowing the arc regardless of
[34:51] scientific proof it raining 40 days and
[34:53] night and God shut the door not Noah
[34:55] another example was Joshua and the son
[34:57] standing still the question was asked
[35:00] well how when scientific research says
[35:03] there had to be movement us stated I
[35:07] don't know how God did it I know just
[35:10] know it happened
[35:11] and before the cat leaving the campus I
[35:16] shared that I would be at J mu and the
[35:18] visiting special friends and church
[35:20] family in Elkton I shared the youtube
[35:22] link and expressed you should check out
[35:25] the link you'll be blessed and
[35:27] encouraged last night during my service
[35:30] my phone kept during service my phone
[35:35] kept vibrating I knew it had to be
[35:37] urgent as my family knew I was at church
[35:39] I checked my phone and it was dr. u he
[35:42] had decided to check out the youtube
[35:44] youtube link and her brother Pruitt's
[35:47] comments about Joshua and the son
[35:50] standing still he shared he was so
[35:52] overwhelmed by a presence that came into
[35:55] the room he immediately gave his heart
[35:57] to the Lord
[35:58] [Applause]
[36:08] [Music]
[36:20] this job is full of miracles hallelujah
[36:26] [Applause]
[36:28] he was thankful that the Lord understood
[36:31] him as he had never prayed and he asked
[36:34] me what should I do next she replied be
[36:37] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[36:39] Christ and he quickly said he knew
[36:42] someone who did that and just let me
[36:44] tell you if you're listening in tonight
[36:46] yes and you have not been baptized in
[36:49] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ come
[36:51] right here they know exactly how to do
[36:53] that hey man he's baptized in his name
[37:01] a man's own she says I have the so
[37:06] thankful to share the good news with
[37:08] others we're looking for that last one
[37:10] and I'm thankful our paths cross who
[37:13] knew that I would complete my graduate
[37:16] studies and would encourage him to
[37:17] listen to truth God knew so thankful so
[37:20] that sister Angela's testimony now I
[37:23] just think it beyond amazing that I
[37:27] forfeited going to Japan to come here
[37:30] and yet God saves the Japanese answered
[37:37] his question decides his heart and he
[37:42] experiences salvation what a mighty God
[37:45] I just want to say this it's his vision
[37:50] we're walking in tonight like Phillip
[37:52] leaves a meeting to minister to one man
[37:55] the ministry continues tonight amen god
[38:00] bless you a man I'm sorry for taking up
[38:03] that much time this now start preaching
[38:10] amen try not to wear you out tonight but
[38:15] I just have a few things to speak to you
[38:18] about and you know we we are wanting to
[38:24] speak about our redemptive rights and
[38:27] kind of where we're at at this moment
[38:30] and taking as much time as I have
[38:34] already I won't be able to maybe go into
[38:38] the depths of this like I would like to
[38:40] tonight but I just want to read from
[38:46] revelation chapter 5 and verse 1 as we
[38:50] can it's moving to our thoughts and our
[38:52] thinking for a moment if you've been
[38:54] sitting a little why won't we all stand
[38:56] as we read this again and that way we'll
[38:59] give you just a little bit of a break
[39:01] amen
[39:03] again I'll try to keep this in a
[39:08] reasonable time but Revelation chapter 5
[39:12] verse 1 I saw in the hand
[39:14] right hand of him that sat on that
[39:16] throne a book written within and on the
[39:18] backside sealed with seven seals and you
[39:22] know then he the the call went out was
[39:25] who was worthy and there was no man
[39:26] worthy and so just to go down to verse
[39:30] six I beheld lo in the midst of the
[39:33] throne two four beasts and the midst of
[39:35] the elders stood a lamb now notice we
[39:38] read that Michael shall stand up who
[39:41] stands for the children of that people
[39:44] and now we see you over here because
[39:47] Daniel is actually the the Hebrew or the
[39:51] Jewish version of the book of Revelation
[39:56] they are parallel together in one
[39:58] applies to the Jews the other applies to
[40:01] the Gentiles and are largely applies to
[40:04] the Gentiles and that's others largely
[40:07] applies to these users things that
[40:09] applies us to of course in the Book of
[40:10] Daniel
[40:11] but in he said in verse six and beheld
[40:15] and lo in the midst of the throne and of
[40:18] the four beasts in the midst of the
[40:20] elders stood a lamb as it had been slain
[40:24] having seven horns and seven eyes which
[40:27] are the seven spirits of God sent forth
[40:30] into all the earth amen god bless you
[40:33] you can have your seats now now speaking
[40:38] about as I said a redemptive rights and
[40:42] where we are standing at this hour in
[40:44] this moment and here brother Branham
[40:47] talking about this in the token he said
[40:49] I'm looking for a time of break forth of
[40:53] the Spirit of God in these last days
[40:56] that we're now living in for another
[41:00] surge of the Holy Spirit into the church
[41:04] for eruption faith and just before it
[41:07] comes and everything is setting straight
[41:10] in order for that and I believe we're
[41:12] now at the time that the word should
[41:15] have the preeminence and I think this is
[41:19] very important that we lay aside our
[41:22] creeds and our thoughts and come back to
[41:25] the word
[41:26] put that word in the proper place in our
[41:30] lives in our and our vocabulary and what
[41:34] would say put it in put the word in our
[41:36] mouth because that's where the sword the
[41:39] Lord must be held is in the mouth God
[41:44] doesn't hold the sword in his hand he
[41:47] holds it in his mouth it goes forth is a
[41:49] word the sharp two-edged sword it'll cut
[41:53] out diseases it'll heal the sick it'll
[41:57] save the lost and it comes as the word
[42:01] is spoken now so you it's important as I
[42:06] said to keep the right atmosphere in
[42:09] this church I'm gonna speak very very
[42:12] personal to you right here because there
[42:15] was gonna be a many ups and downs in
[42:17] this journey a man but you must stand
[42:21] steadfast in the faith no matter how
[42:25] many ups and downs are in the journey
[42:28] you stand steadfast in the faith a man
[42:32] in the greatest battle ever fought
[42:34] brother Branham told of the stars of
[42:37] heaven the heavenly hosts a knee and
[42:40] knee and he says how they hold their
[42:43] positions in the heaven and they stay
[42:45] where that God placed them and he said
[42:49] that we as daniel said should be less
[42:51] shining like the stars of the heaven and
[42:53] our battle here we just as the stars
[42:56] hold their position no matter what
[42:59] changes comes what win bows what
[43:01] situations happen they stay steady and
[43:04] he said so must we hold our position in
[43:09] times like these a man until you must
[43:13] stand strong
[43:15] notice the michael is standing a man the
[43:19] lamb is standing but you also must stand
[43:22] a man you are mature congregation now

[46:55] the Holy Spirit move but you know again
[46:58] you got to do everything you can during
[47:02] times like this to keep in the
[47:05] atmosphere of believing you don't allow
[47:10] circumstances to control where you stand
[47:13] in Christ and what happens in the church
[47:17] I told you I'm here to rally you the
[47:22] congregation you understand amen so I'm
[47:25] taking a lot of Liberty here amen

[47:39] great big God that you can lean on
[47:41] during this time a man now brother
[47:45] branham said some things about revival
[47:47] he said if you want to see a revival
[47:48] start started in yourself you know it's
[47:52] got to begin in you faith has got to
[47:55] begin so it's right in you is where the
[47:58] revival must be and mistake amen and I
[48:04] and again I'm not saying you ain't got
[48:06] in your revival I'm saying you've got to
[48:08] keep throwing on the word of the word of
[48:09] God own that revival keep that flame of
[48:12] going amen brother Branham tells us
[48:15] again here you just take one put one or
[48:17] two good members in the church that's
[48:20] really on fire for God it'll do
[48:22] something for that church that more than
[48:24] 40 revivals you can have right a good
[48:27] cleanse of member set an example with a
[48:31] face shining with the glory of God with
[48:33] sweetness and humility to stand there in
[48:36] the power of God amen and so what do you
[48:40] do what do you do when there's a fire
[48:42] and you wanted to to get up higher you
[48:45] know you have a little spark you blow on
[48:47] it and then you fan the flames and that
[48:52] means no matter who the preacher is a
[48:55] [Applause]
[48:57] man and so no matter who that is
[49:01] preaching yet don't lay out of church or
[49:05] stream because your favorite preacher is
[49:08] it gracious
[49:11] [Music]
[49:14] [Applause]
[49:15] [Music]
[49:17] you've come right over the church and
[49:19] you support your chart and you pull on
[49:21] the gift of God a man you come with the
[49:26] right attitude toward that you see God
[49:29] use men in ways that they could never be
[49:32] used because you pulled on the gift of
[49:35] God you pulled that right out of them a
[49:40] man you don't realize but even brother
[49:42] Brendan said about his gift to heal and
[49:44] he said you don't realize it but it's
[49:46] you doing it he said you are operate
[49:48] this gift you pull me right pulled from
[49:52] me God right out of me to you to your
[49:55] need and you got to realize this is what
[49:58] happens even when preaching is going on
[50:01] and man yeah and you can date to the
[50:04] greatest preacher in this message and
[50:06] stand him here with the wrong atmosphere
[50:08] in his church and he won't be able to do
[50:11] a bit of good because God will never
[50:13] bless the resenting audience hey man you
[50:18] got to come with some faith now brother
[50:20] Badham talked about revival times and he
[50:23] said I remember one night in Vandalia
[50:25] Illinois's I walked into the meetings
[50:28] and I had not been in the meetings more
[50:31] than five minutes and there wasn't a
[50:33] feeble person around the place anywhere
[50:35] you know what did that expectation
[50:39] Amen brother branham walks into the door
[50:41] and just with him walking in the door
[50:43] people get up out of wheelchairs and off
[50:46] of beds and healed by the glory of God
[50:48] dumb the deaf and dumb speaking and the
[50:51] blind scene and just simply the Spirit
[50:54] of the Lord was present and He healed
[50:56] the whole group of them he said now
[50:59] that's when you can do something when
[51:02] revival is going but you let that
[51:06] revival fire you die down then you can
[51:09] hardly the people are still Christians
[51:11] but they're not revived into that spirit
[51:15] that great atmosphere that does
[51:17] something I meant just like in the Forge
[51:22] and a blacksmith's
[51:23] shop you got to get the iron hot before
[51:26] you can build a pounding on the anvil
[51:28] and if you don't it'll never straighten
[51:30] it so you got to fan the flames and they
[51:34] he said that's what it takes to have a
[51:36] revival is everybody under the heat of
[51:39] the Holy Spirit that brought down the
[51:41] powers of God in a revival movement and
[51:44] he said there is prayer meetings going
[51:46] day and night every minute so you don't
[51:51] get into the woe is me and the woe is us
[51:53] attitude but you go to prayer about this
[51:57] and you call on God like you never have
[52:01] you get here early to the church and man
[52:07] you quit singing the song when the
[52:08] saints come drag him in and get to the
[52:14] house of God and be here and pray and
[52:17] create an atmosphere and pull them the
[52:20] gift of God a like I said no matter
[52:22] who's preaching I'm gonna use it if you
[52:27] come in the right attitude and man you
[52:30] got to make this personal a man who you
[52:34] know God we realize God is doing the
[52:36] final work of the pouring out of his
[52:38] spirit it started on the day of
[52:40] Pentecost
[52:41] well I'll pour out my spirit saith God
[52:44] upon all flesh and here he's pouring out
[52:46] the last bit of his spirit and you've
[52:50] got to come here with a fun and say fill
[52:54] me up with that new wine for your corn
[52:57] out your Holy Ghost I want more of it
[53:00] and make room for God to get rid of
[53:03] something of the world and your own
[53:05] sorry attitudes and have a change on the
[53:09] inside let the Holy Spirit come in and
[53:12] saturate your being really important you
[53:19] say God created me that revival
[53:22] oh it's a you know it's kinda like an
[53:26] old boy come into church one night and
[53:28] he sat down you ain't made it through
[53:31] the singing and then he went to sleep on
[53:35] the pewter and st. and count down for a
[53:38] little while and when they dismissed he
[53:40] got up he looked of course you know the
[53:43] Saints had been worshiping and they've
[53:45] been preaching and altar calls and
[53:48] shouting that he slept right through it
[53:50] all and he looked around when he finally
[53:55] got up and looked around he said boy it
[53:57] was a dead duck tonight wouldn't it well
[54:03] there's more than one way to sleep you
[54:06] can sleep spiritually sit right there in
[54:10] your Pew and refuse to move into the
[54:14] Holy Spirit so wow that's just gonna be
[54:17] a dead duck tonight we heard this news
[54:20] or this happened or that happened or
[54:22] handled my favorite preacher ain't
[54:23] preaching disco it's your attitude
[54:27] [Applause]
[54:29] that will make the difference and if you
[54:33] come with the right mental attitude
[54:35] toward eating divine promise of God it
[54:39] will make it come to pass
[54:41] [Applause]
[54:42] [Music]
[54:45] now so you crazy you cried God greeted
[54:49] me a revival Amen brother Branham says
[54:53] in in the Easter seal this is one of his
[54:57] the last year of his ministry he says
[55:00] men and women it'll make you stand to
[55:01] your feet
[55:02] it'll make you do things that God wants
[55:05] you to do I don't care what what
[55:08] somebody else says about it the neighbor
[55:10] says oh that person's lost a man pray
[55:13] all night to read the Bible I don't care
[55:15] what they say is what God called you to
[55:17] do that's right
[55:18] oh they say we can have these
[55:20] old-fashioned Pentecostal revivals and
[55:23] it says oh yes we can - you can have it
[55:26] in yourself and you're the majority and
[55:29] God no matter what the rest of them
[55:32] think so your Bible begins with you and
[55:39] right now we need to be in a state of
[55:41] revival moving in the spirit faith
[55:45] moving in the church believe in God in
[55:49] every situation are you with me this is
[55:55] very very important that you that should
[55:57] take what I'm saying you know we've been
[56:00] through a lot of things in the message
[56:02] through the years as I said I just had
[56:04] 50 celebrated 50 years of ministry and
[56:07] one of the big celebration we just
[56:09] talked about it a little bit of church
[56:11] and and and so on but um you know you
[56:15] know at the same time we're just honored
[56:18] to still be here holding forth the word
[56:21] of life a lot of people think you know
[56:24] that I came that I'm Pentecostal well
[56:27] they as far as denomination I never was
[56:30] in that I just told you up front you
[56:34] know where where I was I got saved in
[56:36] this message the first sermon I ever
[56:39] preached was
[56:40] this message I have never been I've
[56:43] never been in the denomination Pentacles
[56:45] but I am true Pentecostal and I'll
[56:50] always be true Pentecostal because my
[56:53] heritage goes back to the book of Acts a
[56:58] man a man Peter was a Pentecostal and
[57:02] Paul as a Pentecostal and it was Jesus
[57:06] spirit that came down on the day of
[57:08] Pentecost cause for any cost so if you
[57:11] get the Holy Ghost from the inside of
[57:13] you you two will be Pentecostal
[57:15] [Applause]
[57:22] so don't ever think that I've got a foot
[57:26] in Pentecost or I got a little bit of
[57:28] Pentecost I'm all the way Pentecostal so
[57:34] is that midnight right here raise the
[57:41] ball man you get the Holy Ghost on the
[57:44] inside of you
[57:45] it'll make you Abbot you believe it'll
[57:49] make you Sally to make you rejoice it'll
[57:51] make you left the word it'll make you
[57:53] move in the spirit brother Brennan
[58:01] talked about the divine healing moose
[58:03] and and so on and I've done a lot of
[58:06] study about that why did that divine
[58:07] healing move die and of course it was
[58:10] because because that it moved into you
[58:15] know where it became about money and
[58:17] popularity and who had the biggest ten
[58:19] and you know the biggest magazine and
[58:22] you know who's the great one and kingdom
[58:24] building and so on like that and and the
[58:27] revival died but divine healings are
[58:31] still supposed to be in every church in
[58:35] fact brother venom said God never wanted
[58:38] these big divine healing movements and
[58:40] meetings he said he wanted divine
[58:42] healing to be in every church that's
[58:47] where it belongs so you know but then in
[58:50] this brother branham would look back
[58:52] himself and he'd say you know what is it
[58:54] accomplished
[58:55] he said bunch of church members maybe
[58:58] make some man some stop stealing or live
[59:01] true to his wife and but you know what
[59:04] you make have it and the church member
[59:06] come join our group you can hear all
[59:08] this and and a prisoner of Christ and
[59:11] and that brother branham preached paula
[59:14] prisoner and and again you know all of
[59:19] these things that he looked out and he
[59:21] realized you know why why the movement
[59:24] failed him in is because that men would
[59:28] not come harnessed to the Word of God
[59:30] they wanted to the Baptist one to bring
[59:34] his own Baptist
[59:35] is in Pentecost I want to bring his
[59:37] Pentecostal ideas in the Methodists and
[59:40] brother wanted to bring his Methodist
[59:42] ideas in and so you know he said they
[59:46] wouldn't come harness to the word but we
[59:49] we have had now many years to become
[59:53] harnessed to the word there's no excuse
[1:00:00] Amanda that we are harnessed to the word
[1:00:03] that we we are pulling the word we're
[1:00:06] not pulling for a denomination or a move
[1:00:09] but we're we're pulling that word and
[1:00:13] woked to Christ and he said if you abide
[1:00:16] in me and my words abide in you if your
[1:00:19] yoke to me you know because him and his
[1:00:22] word is the same so then of you then you
[1:00:25] can ask what you will and it shall be
[1:00:27] done to you and so you know there's been
[1:00:30] many men that God would have to strip
[1:00:33] down to the ages and you know in order
[1:00:35] to use them and I think we've had a time
[1:00:38] of being stripped stripped of our own
[1:00:41] ideas and our own ways and whatever and
[1:00:44] to come harness to the word and then
[1:00:47] it's a wonderful hour and the time where
[1:00:50] I believe that God can do something in
[1:00:53] the the members of his bride and you
[1:00:57] know I can see and I can look back and I
[1:01:02] can see these men were that they had to
[1:01:05] stand there was a time of training and
[1:01:08] we've had times of training so I go and
[1:01:11] I was there in the hospital room with my
[1:01:13] wife and I said we've been trained for
[1:01:16] moments like this we are believers and
[1:01:21] we're going to believe because that's
[1:01:23] what believers do hey mom
[1:01:27] and there she had a life-threatening
[1:01:30] brain bleeding just within four weeks
[1:01:34] later another MRI and couldn't even find
[1:01:36] a trace of it left
[1:01:42] [Music]
[1:01:44] but anyway you know again again is it's
[1:01:48] a very same thing as we're looking at
[1:01:51] this and I'm trying to to hurry through
[1:01:54] this to get to some points here that I
[1:01:56] want to leave with you tonight but you
[1:01:59] know God's going to have a church in the
[1:02:01] last days a bride without spot or
[1:02:04] wrinkle and they're gonna have to be
[1:02:06] harness to the word and realize we're
[1:02:10] not going on our since knowledge anymor
[1:02:13] see taste smell feeling here and and
[1:02:16] what we're hearing the doctors every
[1:02:17] what we're seeing this or but we're
[1:02:20] going on what the word said hey man cuz
[1:02:24] god's gonna have a people he promised to
[1:02:26] do it he's gonna have somebody that
[1:02:28] would believe somebody that will walk in
[1:02:31] the power of god so you take men like
[1:02:34] Joseph that would be called for a
[1:02:37] purpose and receive a vision then great
[1:02:40] dreams and things of what he would see
[1:02:43] and yet in order to be come into the
[1:02:48] place he would have to have a lot of
[1:02:50] things shaved off of him and this little
[1:02:54] boy that was hated by his brother
[1:02:56] because he seemed to be arrogant saying
[1:02:59] oh you know you're all gonna bow down to
[1:03:01] me I got Stern showed me and God had to
[1:03:05] take him and tore him down into a pit
[1:03:07] and humble him down and strip him down
[1:03:09] and make him a nobody in order to make
[1:03:14] him a somebody a man I believe God's
[1:03:19] been doing that with this bright
[1:03:20] movement not just here but all over the
[1:03:22] world that he's been stripping them down
[1:03:26] to make them realize well you know we
[1:03:28] who we and many of us have got real
[1:03:30] puffy in their own spirit and we're the
[1:03:33] bride and we're
[1:03:34] the chosen and we're the ones going into
[1:03:37] rapture and we're predestinated and we
[1:03:39] will lose our humility we even lose our
[1:03:43] compassion and it gets to be us father
[1:03:47] and no more and we don't have a real
[1:03:49] care for others are you with me
[1:03:55] and Joe's about to get a few things
[1:03:57] shaved off of him
[1:03:59] and then before he could meet his king
[1:04:02] and he and brother madam said sometimes
[1:04:04] God takes his people out like that and
[1:04:06] saves a few of their own wheels off and
[1:04:08] so then they just can't do what they
[1:04:10] wanted to do they're not Liberty to do
[1:04:13] what they want to do because before they
[1:04:14] could come into full power and the love
[1:04:16] slave to Christ they had to be helped
[1:04:18] and had to be shaved off and presented a
[1:04:22] man and then anointed to fulfill a
[1:04:25] purpose that he had ordained them so you
[1:04:29] see there come a time when all of these
[1:04:32] men like Moses would have to be stripped
[1:04:36] down Paul would have to be stripped down
[1:04:39] of all his knowledge his own ideas and
[1:04:43] and and to go through this time of being
[1:04:46] stripped and I just want you to know I
[1:04:48] believe that we're in a cycle of time
[1:04:51] when when the stripping is over and it's
[1:04:56] a time now to stand
[1:05:01] there comes a time where you move into
[1:05:03] another another era you've been in here
[1:05:06] at this time for a while but now we move
[1:05:09] into another era where we're called to
[1:05:11] take a stand so you know Joseph Moses
[1:05:20] Paul had to be said to stand upon their
[1:05:23] call and though they first had to be
[1:05:24] stripped and and retrained and then God
[1:05:28] would show what he could do with
[1:05:30] nobodies you know in all these cases
[1:05:34] they thought they were somebody then
[1:05:38] they learned there were a nobody and
[1:05:41] Joseph the favored son with his dreams
[1:05:44] and the slave down in Egypt and Moses a
[1:05:46] prince reduced to a common Shepherd in
[1:05:49] in Midian and and Paul a Pharisee of the
[1:05:52] Pharisees and knocked off his high horse
[1:05:54] and found himself in the desert being
[1:05:57] retaught we've been through a time of
[1:06:00] reteaching mm-hmm but when Joseph stood
[1:06:06] up out of the prison he came to be right
[1:06:09] next to Pharaoh when Moses stood up out
[1:06:12] of Midian he came with a word in his
[1:06:14] lips and brought mighty Egypt down to
[1:06:17] his knees a man when Paul stood up and
[1:06:21] out of the desert he came with signs and
[1:06:23] wonders and miracles and God's Word open
[1:06:27] to him of what the New Covenant was
[1:06:28] about I'm calculating my time now I want
[1:06:41] just to go here come real personal down
[1:06:46] to this church and what were called far
[1:06:52] back on December the 30th back in 2016
[1:06:57] but the wrong had a dream and this word
[1:07:01] really we were with brother Bisco we
[1:07:05] just finished a meeting we were
[1:07:07] rejoicing of the accomplishments and the
[1:07:09] victories there in this dream people
[1:07:12] were taking photos of us
[1:07:13] and this would this would actually be
[1:07:15] fulfilled in Switzerland which at that
[1:07:18] time but the Bisco was not even going to
[1:07:21] Switzerland it would be we'd only find
[1:07:22] that out just a few days before the
[1:07:25] meeting began that he would have decided
[1:07:28] to come this Dennis dream change to
[1:07:32] Memorial Service and their Timothy who
[1:07:36] was speaking on I
[1:07:38] that's my son Timothy he was speaking on
[1:07:40] I am the resurrection and the life and
[1:07:45] then I came and and I spoke on all doubt
[1:07:49] suffer stand and be healed and as I
[1:07:53] spoke I address brother Ron Spencer
[1:07:59] personally and that knowledge him being
[1:08:02] my friend that was present I think this
[1:08:05] is very important and brother Ron would
[1:08:09] would come to from that dream and the
[1:08:14] presence of the Lord but feel his
[1:08:16] bedroom and he'd speaking other tones
[1:08:19] for over a half an hour that morning he
[1:08:25] would text me and I have heard of
[1:08:27] records of all of this he would text me
[1:08:29] that morning about this but it would be
[1:08:33] just an hour so later that his
[1:08:37] son-in-law Davey would would you know
[1:08:42] Hillman Whitney had been promised a
[1:08:45] child and he would be crushed and the
[1:08:47] truss the tree he would be crushed
[1:08:50] against a tree with his truck on when
[1:08:53] slid on the back of ice you remember he
[1:08:56] would be crushed and broken pelvic now
[1:08:59] the doctor's report again whose reporter
[1:09:01] you gonna believe though doctors report
[1:09:05] says you won't be able to have any
[1:09:07] children his wife was born with a female
[1:09:10] condition that made it medically
[1:09:13] impossible to have a child he was a
[1:09:16] sufferer Davey was a sufferer a man that
[1:09:21] stood and was healed
[1:09:25] [Applause]
[1:09:29] but iran's mother just a few hours after
[1:09:32] the dream would have a heart attack and
[1:09:35] be taken to the hospital
[1:09:37] just hours after this dream and their
[1:09:40] suffering and health issues would be
[1:09:42] gone as she said I'm ready to go and she
[1:09:45] moved from here into a youthful body I
[1:09:50] would actually use that sermon title
[1:09:54] that are that that as a sermon title and
[1:09:57] I preached it in convention some of you
[1:10:00] heard me preach it I had brother Joe
[1:10:02] greens and and spindella
[1:10:05] and I also preached it at home and
[1:10:08] brother Kelly Hilda Branson in a
[1:10:11] convention Theron and also in Holland
[1:10:14] convention up at brother Ivan cars up in
[1:10:17] New Brunswick and finally over just at a
[1:10:19] regular and Wednesday night meeting that
[1:10:21] brother Nathan Brian
[1:10:23] so I preached on that on that sermon or
[1:10:26] suffer stand and be healed I've done it
[1:10:28] six times which is the number of Seth
[1:10:31] for me and when I preached it at brother
[1:10:36] Kelly's it was really phenomenal because
[1:10:39] as I was preaching that my son back home
[1:10:44] not knowing what I was preaching he
[1:10:47] preaches on I am the resurrection and
[1:10:49] the life
[1:10:52] simultaneously as I'm preaching or you
[1:10:55] suffer stand and be healed and so he
[1:10:59] preached that you know that um if he had
[1:11:04] actually preached on it before or left I
[1:11:06] preached on Saturday night Rose now
[1:11:08] suffer stand and be healed and he
[1:11:10] preached it again on Sunday morning now
[1:11:12] it's been a great sermon for me however
[1:11:15] I come to realize it's not just a sermon
[1:11:18] it is a message
[1:11:21] and I don't mean it's a new message we
[1:11:24] got a message it's the 7th angels
[1:11:26] message and not and there's no change
[1:11:28] into that it's a message but this is a
[1:11:31] message of restoration that we received
[1:11:33] by Malecha for the Elijah prophet and it
[1:11:36] speaks of healing and restoration amen
[1:11:40] but now it is time that we preach it
[1:11:44] like never before that it becomes more
[1:11:49] than just a sermon but be it but becomes
[1:11:51] the thrust of a ministry of this man
[1:11:54] ministry but the bride ministry you know
[1:11:57] it's time that we stand up and and we
[1:11:59] say the Bride of Christ has suffered
[1:12:02] through the ages and then we've
[1:12:05] continued to suffer right now even to
[1:12:07] this time and we've suffered through
[1:12:09] pains of thoughts doctrine in this
[1:12:11] message we've suffered through pains of
[1:12:14] Kingdom building we are we're men for
[1:12:17] selfish gain of salt to beat abiding to
[1:12:20] conquer but it's time it is the hour for
[1:12:24] the bride estab I'll be healed

[1:12:51] said brother Tim the satan has just
[1:12:53] really hit us a great blow here it says
[1:12:55] I didn't say what Satan's do and I said
[1:12:58] what are you ready to do are you ready
[1:13:01] to become the revival amen
[1:13:05] are we ready to see the spirit move or
[1:13:09] we're on the edge of the move of God and
[1:13:13] it's already happening you know you had
[1:13:20] miracle after miracle you had a blinding
[1:13:23] crowd this platform you've seen God in
[1:13:27] your midst
[1:13:28] way too we've seen God in your midst
[1:13:31] it's not just a oh yeah a church thing
[1:13:34] it's a universal thing not just
[1:13:36] happening here is happening around the
[1:13:38] world and you're listening to me tonight
[1:13:41] it can happen in your church is getting
[1:13:43] the right atmosphere start believing I
[1:13:50] just want you to know the winds of
[1:13:52] change are in the air
[1:13:57] [Music]
[1:13:58] when I looked out my study window I see
[1:14:02] a big pear tree we're further south than
[1:14:04] you are I've got a big pear tree in it's
[1:14:06] in full bloom daffodils that popped up
[1:14:11] everywhere there are signs of wear
[1:14:17] [Applause]
[1:14:17] [Music]
[1:14:18] [Applause]
[1:14:47] [Music]
[1:14:51] [Applause]
[1:14:57] [Music]
[1:15:02] and the winds of change are in yeah have
[1:15:13] we got rid of our own ideas are we ready
[1:15:16] for to be the revival
[1:15:18] what are these years taught us like I
[1:15:29] said the church in general is still
[1:15:32] operating on since knowledge instead of
[1:15:35] faith since knowledge is see taste smell
[1:15:39] fill in here by now we should be a
[1:15:43] people who look to the unseen instead of
[1:15:48] what we see around us we're hearing
[1:15:53] awful things we are seeing awful things
[1:15:57] come on now but now we gotta quit
[1:16:01] operating by sense knowledge and start
[1:16:04] operating by looking into the unseen
[1:16:10] because the healing that we're looking
[1:16:13] for is not something that can be done
[1:16:16] with since knowledge it is something
[1:16:19] that can only be done by dealing with
[1:16:22] the unseen a demon you can't see
[1:16:28] remember is alive but the ron was
[1:16:32] telling me you know when they they've
[1:16:34] took him into the the surgery and said
[1:16:37] look here and what's this said it that
[1:16:40] you know it'll help you keep distracted
[1:16:42] as they look and he said what's the eddy
[1:16:45] and he's going toward that cancer with
[1:16:47] that needle he said once these things
[1:16:49] are alive and he said they would jump
[1:16:51] and they would move away and they would
[1:16:54] have to chase them around to be able to
[1:16:56] poke into them because they're a living
[1:17:01] creature they're a demon and they seek a
[1:17:06] body and they don't want to be cast out
[1:17:09] and they scream and they get tormented
[1:17:14] when they get cast out but we're like
[1:17:18] Jesus we're here to torment Devils
[1:17:19] before their time because we have been
[1:17:24] called to be serpent bruza meters over
[1:17:30] covers in this hour the people who know
[1:17:32] their God and do exploits was preaching
[1:17:41] the greatest battle ever fought and I
[1:17:46] pay real close attention to visions and
[1:17:50] dreams of brother Brian will not really
[1:17:52] meditate on them and think about them
[1:17:54] and what's the details as you would
[1:17:57] watch them but in this dream he tells of
[1:18:00] a dream in the greatest battle ever
[1:18:02] fought in this dream he saw his former
[1:18:05] trainer which was six-second Smith and
[1:18:09] he said I I I actually fought fifteen
[1:18:14] professional bouts and he said then left
[1:18:17] it and went to the ministry this dream
[1:18:20] he was watching Smith fight fellows that
[1:18:22] was much younger than himself and Smith
[1:18:25] was smashing him down throwing him out
[1:18:27] of the ring and the young guys just
[1:18:29] couldn't stand up against the old
[1:18:31] trainer and in this in this dream he
[1:18:35] remarks to his wife which represents the
[1:18:40] church that Smith was his first trainer
[1:18:45] and and soul as he would tell later in
[1:18:51] and one of the next following sermons at
[1:18:54] Jeffersonville he would tell this dream
[1:18:57] again this time he would call it a
[1:18:59] vision because now he's got some
[1:19:00] interpretation because a a dream when
[1:19:04] it's interpreted is a vision yeah so
[1:19:07] then you know he said that he tells
[1:19:10] again about George Smith my first
[1:19:13] trainer and he said he was more than a
[1:19:15] match for any of the young people in the
[1:19:18] land today in his fighting and he said
[1:19:21] that
[1:19:22] was my first training in the prayer
[1:19:25] lines and this whole sermon was about
[1:19:29] trained soldiers who stand in holder
[1:19:33] positions like the stars of heaven who
[1:19:35] never moved from the course and then he
[1:19:39] tells us exactly what we were to do he
[1:19:41] said now the devil is sitting right at
[1:19:43] Everhart this morning and he's sitting
[1:19:46] there like this little girl's heart a
[1:19:49] little girl that was sick with cancer
[1:19:50] there he's sitting at your heart she's
[1:19:53] sitting running he's saying oh I've seen
[1:19:55] you try before I've heard that before he
[1:19:57] said cast him out that's all cast him
[1:20:01] out what the Bible say here are takes
[1:20:04] casting him out that's right cast him
[1:20:06] out we have been trained a man and he
[1:20:10] said I think what's the matter was i
[1:20:12] spree Church he said I wonder what kind
[1:20:14] of training we've had God's training for
[1:20:17] this great battle of Matthew 24 it said
[1:20:20] there and Daniel 12 said there would be
[1:20:22] a time of trouble such as like never on
[1:20:24] the earth before and we're living that
[1:20:27] time with culture and education and
[1:20:29] things have smothered over the Word of
[1:20:30] God and got into reasoning and the
[1:20:33] battle is now who will stand the battle
[1:20:37] is ready to go in she's an array and
[1:20:39] look what a great opposition we got
[1:20:42] younger who will be like David you stand
[1:20:48] and let that uncircumcised philistine
[1:20:51] defy the armies of the Living God
[1:20:53] I'll go fight him God wants men and
[1:20:57] women this morning who will rise up and
[1:20:59] say I'll take the Lord at his word no
[1:21:03] matter what fail worth this or dad or
[1:21:06] what that one did that has nothing to do
[1:21:08] with it you solves and so forth if
[1:21:11] you're afraid of them get back where you
[1:21:12] belong but God's army is moving forward
[1:21:15] a madman the power men of faith men of
[1:21:19] power
[1:21:20] our men of understanding they don't have
[1:21:22] to be smart they don't have to be
[1:21:24] educated they have to be channels Amen
[1:21:29] God take these little channels and it's
[1:21:31] a preacher that's whole time get your
[1:21:33] channels cleaned out we're God can use
[1:21:35] you get dad out of there get beer out of
[1:21:37] there a man getting let the word flow
[1:21:40] through freely through you hey man it's
[1:21:44] got to come down in your heart and
[1:21:46] anchor there but it can't stay in the
[1:21:48] heart it's got to come out of your mouth
[1:21:50] because when it comes out of your mouth
[1:21:52] the Holy Spirit follows that word and
[1:21:54] makes it come to pass and no word of his
[1:21:57] will return unto Him Boyd but he will
[1:22:00] accomplish what he said to do and he
[1:22:10] showed that this training of the younger
[1:22:14] man won't stand up against the enemy I'm
[1:22:20] going to talk through your personal hair
[1:22:23] we should have learned by now that
[1:22:26] doctrine without power won't work
[1:22:33] mechanics without dynamics won't work
[1:22:38] confessions of faith without experience
[1:22:41] will not produce Christians Amen haven't
[1:22:46] we learned that easy believe ISM won't
[1:22:48] work and neither will just emotion the
[1:22:55] emotion is fine but we won't results
[1:22:58] with it hey man yes you see we can't
[1:23:04] work it up we're getting shout it down
[1:23:08] come on hey man you know many of you
[1:23:13] probably have watts
[1:23:14] you probably watch to sister Lana in our
[1:23:17] church you know when she had their
[1:23:19] victory lap around the church a couple
[1:23:21] of times was she sitting there and were
[1:23:23] you aware but the Holy Spirit got ahold
[1:23:25] of her and I'll tell you what you know
[1:23:28] the next day she goes back absolutely no
[1:23:31] cancer
[1:23:40] and I've seen other people run around
[1:23:43] the church and it was just exercise
[1:23:47] you can't reproduce it you can't produce
[1:23:53] it on your ownself and then you got to
[1:23:57] move in some spirit moves you can't you
[1:24:00] can't just you know well this worked
[1:24:02] here you know we'll try it again it
[1:24:05] won't work that way you've got to have
[1:24:08] exactly the right word for the right
[1:24:11] moment for the right hour and you got to
[1:24:13] be a channel where the God can flow
[1:24:16] through you hey man so I just want to
[1:24:19] say that the this new training ain't
[1:24:22] gonna work
[1:24:23] the psychology that's been preached
[1:24:25] around the message don't save people and
[1:24:28] keep them saying come on hey man you
[1:24:33] know preach and doctrine without and
[1:24:35] without power without miracles is not
[1:24:38] true doctrine through doctrine will have
[1:24:43] miracles if we preach the word signs
[1:24:49] follow the word and the Lord went with
[1:24:53] them confirming the word that they spoke
[1:24:55] with signs following it's a part of the
[1:24:59] gospel no it is an emotion but I
[1:25:05] remember the emotion of it when my
[1:25:07] daughter Lydia stood and grabbed her
[1:25:09] suffering baby Jude who had a kidney
[1:25:13] that was gonna have to be removed
[1:25:15] because it was dead and it would not
[1:25:17] operate and there that was it was going
[1:25:21] to take that that kidney out of that
[1:25:24] non-functioning kidneys that the doctors
[1:25:26] were thinking of removing and one
[1:25:29] morning as the Holy Spirit moved
[1:25:32] I remember the emotion of it when she
[1:25:34] grabbed that baby in her arms and run
[1:25:37] down to the altar and said dad pray for
[1:25:39] this child the doctors are saying
[1:25:42] they're gonna have to take out its
[1:25:43] kidneys
[1:25:44] and there this baby had never wet a
[1:25:47] diaper all night long would wake up
[1:25:50] every morning with a dry diaper because
[1:25:52] of a kidney problem are you with me hey
[1:25:57] man I remember the emotion of it I
[1:26:00] remember when we prayed and I remember
[1:26:04] the next morning when the baby had a wet
[1:26:05] diaper
[1:26:09] [Music]
[1:26:16] and I remember when she took attack to
[1:26:19] the doctor and the doctor examines that
[1:26:21] ain't nothing wrong with this baby we
[1:26:23] must remain a mistake I said there was
[1:26:25] no mistake
[1:26:26] we had God on the scene I remember
[1:26:34] another sufferer
[1:26:36] Aaron Oglesby that big tall man ran down
[1:26:39] the alter one day and surrendered his
[1:26:41] life to God and God filled with the Holy
[1:26:44] Ghost I remember I remember the emotion
[1:26:47] of it but also seeing the results of the
[1:26:53] power of God living in a life hallelujah
[1:26:58] I remember the emotion of it when that
[1:27:01] suffers sister Karen there stood on the
[1:27:04] promise and there did you what catch my
[1:27:09] key word stood lydia stood Aaron stood
[1:27:16] Karen now stands she stood on the
[1:27:20] promise and then had her visitation it
[1:27:26] didn't look good we could not go by
[1:27:30] since knowledge we had to look at the
[1:27:33] unseen and I stood in that hospital that
[1:27:41] day with my children and thank god I've
[1:27:44] got four godly children I'm blessed I
[1:27:48] know that it's just grace wasn't not the
[1:27:52] anything that I did it was His grace
[1:27:54] that's what he did if I did if I did
[1:27:58] anything it was him working through me
[1:28:00] but anyway I stood there with my
[1:28:04] children my son-in-law sandwi daughter
[1:28:07] and we got her down in the in the ICU
[1:28:11] Roy waiting room doctors had said they'd
[1:28:15] bring bleeds like this yes
[1:28:19] it don't look hopeful
[1:28:23] but I remember the emotion of it as I
[1:28:26] stood there that day am I said okay
[1:28:30] one thing we're gonna do is we're not
[1:28:33] gonna fear this is what we're gonna do
[1:28:37] we're going to believe because that's
[1:28:40] what we do we are believers and
[1:28:44] believers believe but you know don't you
[1:28:53] get this and this is very important
[1:28:56] because there can be ups and downs but
[1:28:59] you got to stay steady healing many
[1:29:05] times there's a process and it comes in
[1:29:08] stages I want you to get this I don't
[1:29:11] know how this will be I don't know how
[1:29:13] this will turn out I'm believing we got
[1:29:16] a miracle but even even healing is a
[1:29:21] miracle
[1:29:27] now I'm going to say for some of you
[1:29:29] that don't believe in medicine I'm going
[1:29:31] to stop here just for a minute because
[1:29:35] you should have been stripped of that
[1:29:36] long time ago of you to listen to the
[1:29:38] tapes instead of holding on your old
[1:29:47] ideas or whatever it was Pentecost
[1:29:49] whatever it was and got watched let me
[1:29:55] just say this there are four living
[1:30:04] creatures before the throne there's a
[1:30:08] lion
[1:30:08] the Ox man and the eagle these are nine
[1:30:14] teens they would anoint their principal
[1:30:17] part is to anoint the bride down to the
[1:30:19] aegis the verse soon starts out in the
[1:30:22] first age overlaps into the second is
[1:30:25] the lion anointing and it produced great
[1:30:28] faith and great great power and the roar
[1:30:32] of the lion isn't a bonus of a lion and
[1:30:34] the tenacity to hold on to the promise
[1:30:37] the over power of the enemy and then of
[1:30:43] course there's the Ox anointing were
[1:30:46] that it would change from that to where
[1:30:49] they would die and and go down into
[1:30:51] death and greater Rorick things would
[1:30:54] happen under them under that anointing
[1:30:57] and it would take great persecution and
[1:31:00] go down into death then there would be
[1:31:03] the man anointing and God wouldn't use
[1:31:06] modern inventions actually the Gutenberg
[1:31:09] press and and he would print the Bible
[1:31:13] in the language the common language of
[1:31:15] the people which at that time was a
[1:31:16] German the German under Luther's move
[1:31:19] and they they brought it out of the
[1:31:21] cloisters of and the dark places the
[1:31:24] caves of Roman and then they take some
[1:31:27] print the Bible put it in the language
[1:31:29] of the common people instead of Latin
[1:31:31] and bring it our Greek or some foreign
[1:31:34] language
[1:31:35] put it right down into the common
[1:31:37] language of the people
[1:31:39] Germany German and they and it would
[1:31:43] bring such a Liberty and bring such a
[1:31:45] deliverance and it was to posed a black
[1:31:48] horse rider that was coming out you know
[1:31:51] selling the very gospel itself measured
[1:31:55] weep for the penny measure or for penny
[1:31:57] and so on like that and so it would it
[1:32:00] would do that and then and then then God
[1:32:02] would use then the Eagle anointing for
[1:32:07] the last days and we believe we're under
[1:32:09] that an eagle anointing and the eagle
[1:32:12] and the eagle this is wonderful he never
[1:32:15] has to worry about crossing the river
[1:32:20] all of the other beasts aligned the man
[1:32:23] and the ox are earthbound creatures but
[1:32:25] the eagle can fly into other dimensions
[1:32:28] and in say was a sitting duck said he
[1:32:31] was a flying eagle
[1:32:35] hey man and the very word rapture meat
[1:32:40] comes from the Greek word for pazzo
[1:32:41] which means to snatch or to seize and
[1:32:45] carry away amen
[1:32:50] so it is the coming of the Lord where he
[1:32:53] will catch away that's harpazo cat's
[1:32:57] away seize grasp and pull them right out
[1:33:00] it'll be a miracle right in the nick of
[1:33:03] time take a bride out of here in the
[1:33:05] glory right out of the problems right
[1:33:09] out of the world right out of the sin
[1:33:10] around us somebody's still with me
[1:33:14] so you gotta you got these all of these
[1:33:16] not when it comes down to natural
[1:33:19] applications to divine healing because
[1:33:21] they are they're healing God sometimes
[1:33:24] will anoint us with great faith like a
[1:33:26] lion and a great boldness and tenacity
[1:33:30] to hold on to the word and you know it
[1:33:32] it may take a time for for the enemy to
[1:33:35] die but it's gonna come to this death
[1:33:37] because we're fighting it out amen
[1:33:41] you come over on the other end of the
[1:33:43] speculum it's the Eagle heat that's the
[1:33:45] miracle and it's not as you write at one
[1:33:48] moment you're in this situation next
[1:33:50] moment you're out of it that's a miracle
[1:33:55] there's there's other times that God
[1:33:58] uses he uses the the man the unmanned
[1:34:06] anointing and God says I'm going to heal
[1:34:09] you but I'm going to use man I'm going
[1:34:14] to use knowledge I'm going to use
[1:34:16] doctors I'm going to use medicine but
[1:34:22] they can't heal you because I am the
[1:34:27] Lord God that heals all diseases
[1:34:30] is somebody with me medicine can heal
[1:34:34] doctors can heal but they can insist
[1:34:36] medicine use it well brother damn I
[1:34:40] believe that God can heal without
[1:34:41] medicine soda ah I preferred that way
[1:34:45] any man I love it that way when it comes
[1:34:47] and we didn't take even appeal right hey
[1:34:52] man
[1:34:53] III preferred that way that's wonderful
[1:34:56] actually I would have preferred when I
[1:34:59] come here not to have to get in the
[1:35:01] airplane I hate him I would rather the
[1:35:04] Lord just pick me up and set me and
[1:35:06] brother Ron's house he can do it he did
[1:35:13] it with villa
[1:35:14] we got one example in the Bible where
[1:35:17] God did it we got hundreds of examples
[1:35:19] where he healed so you see so you see
[1:35:29] again sometimes God says all right but
[1:35:33] I'm turning the face of the anointing
[1:35:35] this way and I'm gonna use doctors I'm
[1:35:39] gonna use medicine I'm gonna use that
[1:35:44] sometimes you know we don't like to talk
[1:35:48] about this one but God heals by death
[1:35:56] brother Tim you know we have faithless
[1:35:59] and these all died in faith Hebrews 11
[1:36:03] you see he heals all diseases man that's
[1:36:08] why we can save the sufferer Christine
[1:36:11] sister Christine Spencer you know stood
[1:36:14] and was healed moved into a new body a
[1:36:18] greater divine healing God took her
[1:36:21] right out of suffering right into his
[1:36:23] presence and it's real he heals all
[1:36:27] diseases
[1:36:29] it doesn't matter if he uses the line
[1:36:31] the Ox the man or the eagle he heals all
[1:36:37] he with me so far so anyway as I said I
[1:36:42] remember the emotion of it that night
[1:36:46] when sister Karen was Derek in the room
[1:36:48] now here here I told her I spoke under
[1:36:53] the anointing right there it just came
[1:36:55] out of my mouth it's like sometimes you

[1:36:59] tongue and they just spoke out of me I
[1:37:01] said she'll be in IC room tonight
[1:37:04] tomorrow night she will be in her own
[1:37:07] room and the next night she'll be at

[1:37:31] still weak she's unable to dress herself

[1:37:38] to help her get dressed
[1:37:40] hi again she was unable to do regular
[1:37:44] work she was there in her home later she
[1:37:48] lost the peripheral vision was borned

[1:38:08] could see but you know she'll we can fix
[1:38:11] some of that so she's laying on her bed
[1:38:15] after about a week of this and she's
[1:38:20] thinking about what her life is gonna be
[1:38:22] like from now on and we're human at
[1:38:28] least I am and my family we're human and
[1:38:33] she was feeling sorry for herself and
[1:38:38] she was thinking about her future and
[1:38:40] what it would be like and what you know
[1:38:42] the state that she was in and and and
[1:38:46] and it felt very hopeless and all of a
[1:38:52] sudden she began to think about the Lord
[1:38:57] and she began to look into the unseen
[1:39:00] began to thank him for all his many
[1:39:02] blessings begin to praise him and as he
[1:39:07] as what's now as the atmosphere changed
[1:39:15] what's what I'm saying as the atmosphere
[1:39:18] changed the Holy Spirit moved down into
[1:39:23] that room come right there over her her
[1:39:26] vision returned in that moment and a
[1:39:32] little crippled child 18 months old who
[1:39:34] had never walked brother Ron had seen
[1:39:36] him in a vision walkin but he had still
[1:39:38] never walked and then Bethany had just
[1:39:41] set him down at the end of the bed not
[1:39:44] where he could reach anything just right
[1:39:46] in the middle of the floor as she walked
[1:39:48] into the room and the Holy Spirit swept
[1:39:50] through and her mother she recognized
[1:39:53] her mother could see her mother you can
[1:39:55] see your visions coming back
[1:39:57] you saw me as I walked up and and as the
[1:40:00] Holy Spirit will rush down through there
[1:40:03] and moved around into that house and
[1:40:05] come around and swept over that child it
[1:40:08] got up out of the middle of the floor
[1:40:11] and ran all over my house
[1:40:14] [Applause]
[1:40:36] and all that was wonderful that was
[1:40:39] marvelous
[1:40:40] but she still had a high blood pressure
[1:40:43] she still had some other problems and
[1:40:47] she still her blood pressure was spiking
[1:40:50] on her and we were concerned about not

[1:43:16] this here while back and I didn't get
[1:43:20] through with it but we were in Germany
[1:43:24] some people wonder why I went to the
[1:43:27] Rings you know it not kind of home for a
[1:43:32] preacher I don't know what Bible verse
[1:43:34] study is but I was got a letter from a
[1:43:39] guy the other day and said you know you
[1:43:41] brother Tim um they're asking about your
[1:43:44] ring you know it's Satanists that wears
[1:43:47] a ring on that finger not sitting well
[1:43:50] I'm not a Satanist
[1:43:52] I said um I'll tell you why were the
[1:43:56] ring well you know my wife had been
[1:44:00] going through horrible menopause and
[1:44:05] some really emotional difficult times
[1:44:09] where everything in life was upside down
[1:44:13] and this is what it brought on the brain
[1:44:16] bleed because that caused high blood
[1:44:17] pressure which caused a wee you know
[1:44:22] bursting of a blood vessel and and so on
[1:44:26] like that and and and and you know and
[1:44:29] even now she's been healed and she's
[1:44:32] back to normal and she's doing her work
[1:44:35] but she still she says still having
[1:44:38] these horrible emotional situations and
[1:44:41] so we we go to Germany and I'm preaching
[1:44:45] there in the meeting we're in very
[1:44:47] difficult times
[1:44:48] there's some men there that are in some
[1:44:51] that are in a cult following a cult
[1:44:54] preacher and they they
[1:44:59] there was some of them that was even
[1:45:01] speaking in that meeting and I was I was
[1:45:05] ministering there I you know I there
[1:45:08] were things I was preaching that was
[1:45:10] dealing with different situations and
[1:45:14] then we had a man that you know got up
[1:45:17] from the cult preaching and he began to
[1:45:20] you know he looked right down at me and
[1:45:22] told me you know put your notes down and
[1:45:25] get with me and whatever cuz I was
[1:45:27] writing for one false doctor after
[1:45:30] another false doctor another doctor
[1:45:33] after another false doctor and he says
[1:45:36] he looked at me it's kind of like
[1:45:38] looking looking back I'm looking back at
[1:45:42] one of you aligned right straight
[1:45:44] through where there was nobody and he
[1:45:46] look right down at me and he says you
[1:45:48] know you know you you put down your
[1:45:51] notes and get with me I said and then he
[1:45:57] was saying if you don't get on our train
[1:45:58] you're gonna miss the rapture listen I'm
[1:46:02] getting on your train to go nowhere
[1:46:13] so after the service I gathered some of
[1:46:17] them guys and we have a good here
[1:46:21] sometimes you don't see what goes on
[1:46:24] behind the scenes but I'll tell you what
[1:46:27] I had my sword out and sometimes I use a
[1:46:32] sword
[1:46:33] it's a slice and cut and sometimes I
[1:46:35] just spank with it but I was using the
[1:46:39] Word of God and I was dealing with some
[1:46:42] of those and my wife you know had heard
[1:46:44] some of these about some of these people
[1:46:46] and their meanness and how they treated
[1:46:48] and did and she got real nervous she
[1:46:51] went to her room and she was crying all
[1:46:54] through the night and I was out 2 2
[1:46:57] o'clock in the morning and she was just
[1:46:58] an emotional basket case and and all
[1:47:04] nervous and whatever from this hormonal
[1:47:06] issues that just pushed everything over
[1:47:09] the over the edge and you know I I went
[1:47:14] into the room and I had to calm her down
[1:47:17] and talk to her and pray with her and we
[1:47:19] finally get to bed and and brother Ron
[1:47:22] and brother Frasier is going through
[1:47:24] some deals he's not able to come to meet
[1:47:26] and say jeomsun kind of late and he
[1:47:28] comes in for the meeting
[1:47:30] and and he begins to preach and and he
[1:47:33] says you know he talks about sister
[1:47:35] Karen and her healing and little drew
[1:47:38] and different things and and then he
[1:47:40] says you know God's going to God's going
[1:47:43] to finish the work that he started and
[1:47:48] he walks down he pulls sister Guerin and
[1:47:51] prays for her and from that moment there
[1:47:54] was no more hormonal issue
[1:47:56] no more hormone medicine
[1:48:01] totally me well you know when I got
[1:48:09] married it was in 1975 somebody sort of
[1:48:15] said bless her heart but I bought a
[1:48:23] little ring for her it was constant 98
[1:48:26] dollars we scraped for every penny we
[1:48:29] could get she bought a ring for me for
[1:48:34] $48 little gold simple ban about 25
[1:48:41] years aboard later hid had worn thin
[1:48:43] that broke she said I want to get you a
[1:48:46] nicer ring this one's right here is I
[1:48:50] don't know a little over $500 ring
[1:48:54] someone will get you a nicer ring I
[1:48:57] wasn't able to get you know we wasn't
[1:48:59] able to get a nice ring then I'll get
[1:49:00] you a ring that one's broke so I took
[1:49:03] that one and laid it in a box put this
[1:49:07] one on my wart
[1:49:08] and it was too big for this finger and
[1:49:13] my board he was too big for this finger
[1:49:17] and he kept sliding around has got
[1:49:20] grooves in it and it was eating him to
[1:49:22] my finger and wasn't comfortable it was
[1:49:24] irritating and I finally just have to
[1:49:27] try and for some months to wear it I
[1:49:29] said I reached and got my old ring out
[1:49:32] took it as jeweler and said fix this
[1:49:33] thing and he repaired it and I took this
[1:49:36] ring put it in the box and put my
[1:49:38] original ring on and went on but when I
[1:49:42] come home from that meeting I passed by
[1:49:45] that box and I looked over at it and I
[1:49:51] thought as I looked at that ring and I
[1:49:55] said you know what I got a new wife God
[1:49:58] gave me a new wife she's healed
[1:49:59] delivered brain bleed high blood
[1:50:03] pressure nervousness hormone situation
[1:50:05] all gone I got a new wife
[1:50:10] so I reached in there and I got that
[1:50:14] ring out of my box and then tried it on
[1:50:17] that finger and it wouldn't work and so
[1:50:19] I tried it on that finger that ringer
[1:50:21] there that finger and that fit and so I
[1:50:26] we're dissing because this is before
[1:50:28] menopause and the way this one plugs his
[1:50:30] afternoon
[1:50:32] [Music]
[1:50:46] what I want you to remind you if you're
[1:50:48] going through that God heals menopause
[1:50:50] too and you don't have to let the devil
[1:50:54] attach to it yeah somebody with me now
[1:50:58] you don't have to let the devil attach
[1:51:01] itself it's a natural thing in your life
[1:51:03] but God can bring you through it but I
[1:51:06] remember the emotion of it
[1:51:08] I remember the motion when that sufferer
[1:51:11] Justin we're cemented him a wayward boy
[1:51:14] living out in the world came running
[1:51:16] down to the church in the middle of the
[1:51:18] night of that prayer line right 20
[1:51:21] minutes after his sister had come
[1:51:24] through the line and said our family has
[1:51:25] separated my brother's out in the world
[1:51:28] and in sin and and and I want my brother
[1:51:32] back
[1:51:33] hey man and it wasn't just noise and
[1:51:36] shouting and then there was something
[1:51:40] that happened in that atmosphere is that
[1:51:43] boy come to church in his pajamas
[1:51:48] somebody with me James will of God wind
[1:51:52] got him out of bed
[1:51:53] and brought him to the house of God and
[1:51:56] here he comes back turning the church on
[1:51:58] the arms of the Deacons and they bring
[1:52:01] him down to the altar and we pray him
[1:52:04] through to the Holy Ghost amen that's
[1:52:08] been four or five years ago now and he's
[1:52:10] a young married man a man still
[1:52:13] delivered I'm just telling you it ain't
[1:52:16] emotion this emotion there's a pattern
[1:52:19] [Applause]
[1:52:24] hallelujah amen
[1:52:27] I remember in that trailer and also with
[1:52:30] a little boy Jed five years old had he
[1:52:33] been to the doctor that day had burned a
[1:52:36] hundred warts off of his body and the
[1:52:39] doctor says there's too many more and I
[1:52:42] cannot do them all in one session you'll
[1:52:44] have to bring him back after he heals up
[1:52:46] from this and bring him back to get some
[1:52:49] more burned off and she and that mother
[1:52:52] stood and brought her little boy through
[1:52:55] that prayer line and that night every
[1:52:59] wart fell off of his body
[1:53:02] [Applause]
[1:53:03] I remember the emotion at the morning
[1:53:11] service when I was preaching on the
[1:53:13] revealing of sons and I was saying God
[1:53:16] has done some extreme things in this
[1:53:19] generation and he's still doing extreme
[1:53:21] things tonight he is a God who of do
[1:53:25] extreme things to get his people to
[1:53:27] believe
[1:53:32] [Music]
[1:53:34] and God sits Malekith for with miracle
[1:53:38] after miracle after miracle after
[1:53:40] miracle to turn our hearts back to
[1:53:42] believe and again because God does
[1:53:44] extreme things and he will go to the
[1:53:49] extreme to save the Lost
[1:53:51] he'll go to the extreme to heal the sick
[1:53:53] this God is an extraordinary God who
[1:53:57] does extreme things hallelujah and as I
[1:54:06] was preaching that and we come to the
[1:54:09] end of the service and I started singing
[1:54:12] glory to his name and I changed it to
[1:54:15] leaning on the everlasting arms a little
[1:54:19] sister 90 pounds dying with lymphoma no
[1:54:24] type of limp on the cancer or cancer in
[1:54:26] the lungs is Hodgkin's disease that was
[1:54:29] in the lungs and she was dying and she
[1:54:36] sitting up in the mezzanine of our
[1:54:40] church with a mask over her face because
[1:54:44] she had had forked of 12 treatments that
[1:54:47] she was to have and she was on her
[1:54:49] fourth one and the next day that were to
[1:54:52] do PET scan her cat scan her some scan
[1:54:55] to just find out whether medicine was
[1:54:58] even working whether the cancer was
[1:55:01] still growing but in that atmosphere of
[1:55:04] the Holy Ghost that day that little girl
[1:55:07] stood mother of five children stood up
[1:55:11] in that mezzanine and she began to run
[1:55:14] around our building worshiping God
[1:55:18] shouting and praising him I don't even
[1:55:20] know how she had the strength to do it
[1:55:22] she made two laps around the the
[1:55:25] building went back and sat down in the
[1:55:28] mezzanine seating and worshiped God
[1:55:30] didn't for some some hours after that
[1:55:33] worshiping God and thanking God for his
[1:55:36] healing and he goes back to the doctor
[1:55:39] the next day and she's watching the the
[1:55:43] nurse and the technician seeing what
[1:55:46] kind of reaction
[1:55:47] and she has and she can't read nothing
[1:55:49] she's just done face and she doesn't
[1:55:52] show any emotion so she don't know what
[1:55:55] to think in here the doctor comes in and
[1:55:57] he sits down and he says ma'am I don't
[1:56:08] know how to explain this but your cancer
[1:56:12] is gone
[1:56:17] [Music]
[1:56:24] and she's trying to wrap her mind around
[1:56:27] this you know and so she says whoa how
[1:56:33] often do you see these kind of results
[1:56:36] he said we've never seen these kind of
[1:56:39] results I remember the emotion with the
[1:56:49] prayer line when that sufferer
[1:56:52] Mariah Pruett stood with some bobby pins
[1:56:54] in her hands and she came there she
[1:56:57] wanted to wear hairpins again she had
[1:57:00] alopecia and all the hair had left her
[1:57:02] head she was a bald-headed little girl
[1:57:05] eyelashes lose a license good arm hair a
[1:57:08] leg hair every two all the hair is
[1:57:10] attacked and gone and then she is
[1:57:13] completely bald and she walks into the
[1:57:15] prayer line with her little three pens
[1:57:17] and she said I want to wear these and I
[1:57:21] remember the emotion of the moment but I
[1:57:24] also remember the results
[1:57:27] it wasn't just emotion her heritage in
[1:57:36] the Dro a man and here it all came back
[1:57:39] and today she has a full head of glory
[1:57:43] and I just want to say it's a
[1:57:45] representative of the Church of the
[1:57:47] Living God I believe God is restoring
[1:57:50] the glory to in spirit power and the
[1:57:57] Holy Spirit is not moving in the midst
[1:57:59] of us and there's a people standing on
[1:58:01] their feet restored and then people want
[1:58:08] me to be afraid of emotion afraid to
[1:58:10] rejoice I've been been stripped a long
[1:58:13] time ago of all my my ambition and my
[1:58:17] pride and I just say use me God is a
[1:58:20] tool to bring realization to this sinful
[1:58:23] cursed world that we're living in today
[1:58:25] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[1:58:28] today and forever we've got a commission
[1:58:34] let's tell the Supper everywhere to
[1:58:37] stand and be evil
[1:58:39] what the wrong your name was called
[1:58:42] [Applause]
[1:58:44] [Music]
[1:58:47] [Applause]
[1:58:57] and seeing this finished fair and save
[1:59:01] this to the bride around the world I'm
[1:59:03] saying this everybody this is our
[1:59:05] message we have suffered long enough
[1:59:07] we have separately the agent is a
[1:59:09] rapture time it's a time for people to
[1:59:12] stand and be killed and our message this
[1:59:19] tool it's not just so suffer stand and
[1:59:22] be healed but as Timothy was to preach I
[1:59:25] am the resurrection and the life that is
[1:59:29] also our message it's one and the same
[1:59:32] I am NOT I was but the present God
[1:59:35] nothing I will be but the present God I
[1:59:38] am the resurrection and I've been healed
[1:59:51] in a moment in a twinkling of an eye
[1:59:53] [Applause]
[1:59:58] it's our position let's walk in that
[2:00:02] position let's be the revival that the
[2:00:06] musicians come I'm hearing of revivals
