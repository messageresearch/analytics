[19:03] hands up this morning I believe we can
[19:06] cast every every sickness out of this
[19:08] building every fear out of this building
[19:10] by the power of the name of Jesus Christ
[19:11] that we heard last night there is so
[19:14] many redemptive powers in that name it's
[19:16] not all we can do to pray that is our
[19:18] first choice of action is to pray let's
[19:21] agree together that we could intercede
[19:23] for these needs father Lord we love you
[19:26] Jesus we love you Lord Father there's
[19:30] none like You Lord well God is the
[19:33] songwriter oh we could search and search

[19:37] yours father there's no there's no
[19:39] atomic power there's nope there's no

[20:13] wanted to express your attribute of
[20:14] healing to that need Lord you wanted to

[20:25] and one power Lord to reach out and
[20:26] claim that victory this morning God we

[58:13] you caught it but it was just so great
[58:15] it in Joshua's day God rained down
[58:18] stones in the same Valley that David
[58:23] would pick up and so those missiles that

[1:11:46] bless you if you have your Bibles we
[1:11:48] want to just take a few minutes and the
[1:11:50] word this morning Book of Psalms the
[1:11:53] sixteenth chapter Book of Psalms the
[1:11:56] sixteenth chapter and maybe just to just
[1:11:59] to read here a portion of Scripture I I
[1:12:02] love this 16th chapter of Psalms of
[1:12:05] course it's it's a it's it's quite a
[1:12:08] powerful psalm preserve me O God for in
[1:12:16] thee do I put my trust oh my soul that
[1:12:20] has said under the Lord thou art my Lord
[1:12:23] my goodness extended not to thee but to
[1:12:28] the saints that are in the earth and to
[1:12:32] the excellent in whom all my delight
[1:12:34] their sorrows shall be multiplied that
[1:12:38] hasten after another God their drink
[1:12:41] offerings of blood will I not offered
[1:12:43] nor take up the names into my lips for
[1:12:47] the Lord is the portion of mine
[1:12:49] inheritance and if my cup down
[1:12:52] maintaining my lot you can never read
[1:12:55] this without thinking of brother Branham
[1:12:56] walking out of that your Roberts
[1:12:58] University and saying looking around and
[1:13:02] Lord said I'm your portion a man I don't
[1:13:05] know about you all but I'll take the
[1:13:07] Lord is my portion amen the Lord is my
[1:13:10] portion of mine inheritance and of my
[1:13:12] cup thou maintainence my Lots the lines
[1:13:15] are fallen unto me in Pleasant places
[1:13:18] yeah I have a godly heritage I will
[1:13:23] bless the Lord who have given me counsel
[1:13:25] my rains also instruct me in the night
[1:13:28] season I have set the Lord always before
[1:13:31] me but RAM actually compares this when
[1:13:34] Jesus said seek ye first the kingdom of
[1:13:36] God he said this that he actually is
[1:13:39] showing that that's what David is saying
[1:13:40] I've set the Lord before me always
[1:13:42] because he is at my right hand I shall
[1:13:44] not be moved therefore my heart is glad
[1:13:47] and my glory rejoices my flesh shall
[1:13:52] rest and hope for that will not suffer
[1:13:55] that will not leave my soul in Hell
[1:13:57] neither with I'll suffer thine Holy One
[1:13:59] to see corruption now this is Messianic
[1:14:01] prophecy right here amen but we are air
[1:14:04] right amen thou will show me the path of
[1:14:08] life now if you're a study or the
[1:14:10] message by the brand preaches an entire
[1:14:12] sermon right here the path of life amen
[1:14:15] and in thy presence is the fullness of
[1:14:20] joy at the right hand there are
[1:14:22] pleasures forevermore we ask the Lord to
[1:14:26] bless his word this morning I want to if
[1:14:29] you just be seated I'd like to just take
[1:14:31] a few minutes this morning to speak to
[1:14:33] you on this subject of in thy presence
[1:14:37] is the fullness of joy we're in thy
[1:14:41] presence it is the fullness of joy amen
[1:14:44] and I I think of sometimes when you
[1:14:48] start thinking about this it's a
[1:14:50] powerful a powerful subject to think
[1:14:53] about that God brings joy when he
[1:14:55] becomes present in the church you know
[1:14:58] some time ago I was just preaching a
[1:15:01] little bit and I was back on that little
[1:15:04] the the Bible talks about a woman who
[1:15:07] brought the alabaster all to Jesus you
[1:15:10] know and I thought it was amazing is
[1:15:12] that Jesus tells after this great
[1:15:15] example of worship but this woman washes
[1:15:17] the feet of Jesus and and she she dries
[1:15:20] his feet with her hair and she lays out
[1:15:22] that Jesus actually said that every time
[1:15:26] the gospel is preached wherever it is
[1:15:27] preached you need to mention this woman
[1:15:30] and I thought it was amazing is that as
[1:15:32] that the Lord Jesus was ensuring that
[1:15:35] this woman would always be mentioned
[1:15:38] where his gospel is preached because
[1:15:40] something that she did in the way she
[1:15:42] acted toward his presence was something
[1:15:44] that he thought that would be a memorial
[1:15:46] now I kind of think is funny that the
[1:15:48] Lord wouldn't would actually make sure
[1:15:50] that even the stiffest church members
[1:15:52] had to hear this you know I mean even
[1:15:54] the stiffest churches it don't matter
[1:15:56] where in the world is priest Teknik they
[1:15:59] actually have to read this and
[1:16:01] talk about this poor woman who got down
[1:16:03] in the face of everyone in warship
[1:16:05] Taniya can y'all only imagine this
[1:16:07] little girl running the end of the end
[1:16:09] of the end of the house of Simon the
[1:16:11] straight Pharisee and all these
[1:16:13] religious people and this woman seen an
[1:16:16] opportunity was right in front of her
[1:16:18] that she would have never had an
[1:16:20] opportunity that was just just she just
[1:16:23] happened to be passing by and saw that
[1:16:25] man sitting there and and that something
[1:16:28] struck her little heart there's an
[1:16:30] opportunity right here right now that I
[1:16:32] could get in the presence of Jesus
[1:16:35] Christ and she she had heard about the
[1:16:37] feet of Jesus right amen the Prophet
[1:16:40] said another harlot had told her that
[1:16:42] had been caught in adultery had been
[1:16:45] through at the feet of Jesus and at the
[1:16:47] feet of Jesus the Pharisees was trying
[1:16:49] to stone her and it was at the feet of
[1:16:51] Jesus that he protected her and gave her
[1:16:54] a new life and said go and sin no more
[1:16:57] and she happened to see this little girl
[1:16:59] passing by happen to see there's nobody
[1:17:02] at his feet so there's an opportunity
[1:17:04] here that I could get in his feet and
[1:17:07] good things happen at the feet of Jesus
[1:17:10] amen brother BAM said she went home and
[1:17:13] got everything she had and went and
[1:17:15] bought that all amen and she come in and
[1:17:18] brother man said it like this
[1:17:19] he said she literally elbowed her way
[1:17:22] amen into the feet of Jesus amen he a
[1:17:25] man she elbowed her way to get there and
[1:17:27] I tell you I him and there's nothing
[1:17:29] like a people Amen that's willing to
[1:17:31] elbow their way through they meant to
[1:17:34] get to the feet of Jesus Christ because
[1:17:36] if you can ever get to the feet of Jesus
[1:17:38] and some powerful things begin to happen
[1:17:41] at the feet of Jesus there's something I
[1:17:43] love about this little woman Haman when
[1:17:45] she got there all the things that she
[1:17:48] had been holding back her whole life all
[1:17:50] the little things she had never gave to
[1:17:52] no man
[1:17:53] she had never gave to anybody but when
[1:17:56] she got into feet of Jesus she started
[1:17:58] giving every thing she ever they mend
[1:18:01] them things that she had held back she
[1:18:03] started giving up right there and I'll
[1:18:05] tell you when it gets to the feet of
[1:18:07] Jesus that's a time right amen and
[1:18:10] brother Branham makes it makes a point
[1:18:11] out of this in a message of pride
[1:18:14] he said when she got to the feet of
[1:18:15] Jesus he said notice she broke open that
[1:18:18] model he meant she didn't she didn't she
[1:18:21] didn't take the lid off and use a little
[1:18:24] all he meant in the ideas she might put
[1:18:27] the lid back on sometime he said but she
[1:18:29] broke the bottle amen and when you break
[1:18:32] open the bottle it means I'm not
[1:18:34] planning on leaving here with nothing
[1:18:36] amen I'm not planning to save on
[1:18:38] something for later amen but I'll tell
[1:18:40] you what she was willing to do right
[1:18:42] then was pour out everything she had at
[1:18:46] the feet of Jesus Christ now you can
[1:18:48] only imagine she's crying she's shouting
[1:18:51] she's weeping amen the slots running all
[1:18:56] is all over her amen free consensus on
[1:18:59] the carpet or on the rugs and it's on
[1:19:01] Jesus and it's on her my she'd made a
[1:19:04] mess amen and brother Brendan said this
[1:19:07] little girl from this position looks up
[1:19:09] at G he said she looks up and she starts
[1:19:12] thinking in her mind am I doing wrong am
[1:19:16] i doing wrong amen have you ever been
[1:19:18] there have you ever have you ever woke
[1:19:20] up from a shot and fit so did I be wrong
[1:19:23] amen but the Prophet says he says she
[1:19:26] was thinking have I done wrong he said
[1:19:30] then all of a sudden
[1:19:31] I say unto her thy sins which are many
[1:19:34] are forgiven go in peace he said see she
[1:19:38] wasn't doing wrong but she was
[1:19:41] worshipping in a place that can remove
[1:19:43] every sin she was worshipping somebody
[1:19:46] who can forgive her every problem now I
[1:19:49] tell you something when you set out to
[1:19:51] begin to worship the God of Abraham
[1:19:53] there are things released in the
[1:19:56] presence of God that you're not gonna
[1:19:58] get in the presence of anybody else amen
[1:20:01] but in the presence of God you see what
[1:20:03] she did when she recognized his presence
[1:20:07] when she recognized his presence 1964
[1:20:10] unrecognized presence brother BAM said
[1:20:12] if we can only recognize Amen that he is
[1:20:15] appearing to us in this meeting for one
[1:20:18] purpose and that's to release our
[1:20:21] desires that we have in him Hey
[1:20:24] we've got to recognize his presence and
[1:20:27] now you recognize his presence is when
[1:20:30] the promised word for the age is
[1:20:32] manifested not seen not the promised
[1:20:35] word of another age so how do we
[1:20:37] recognize the presence of God when the
[1:20:39] word has been fulfilled that is the true
[1:20:43] identification of divine presence now
[1:20:46] brother Branham Oh tell us tell us in
[1:20:48] the in the ministry he'll tell us Amen
[1:20:51] that there are pastors and preachers and
[1:20:53] evangelists and teachers he said but see
[1:20:56] now my ministry is different than theirs
[1:20:58] he said my ministry is actually to prove
[1:21:02] the reality of his presence he said to
[1:21:05] bring you into the reality of the
[1:21:08] presence of Jesus Christ that you may
[1:21:10] see him know him and identify the
[1:21:13] promise of your name do you see what
[1:21:15] brother Ram did for us he took us beyond
[1:21:17] our feelings he took us on beyond the
[1:21:20] idea that we feel the presence of God so
[1:21:23] when we don't feel him he's not present
[1:21:25] when we do feel him he is presence
[1:21:27] that's where the Pentecostals were when
[1:21:29] the Prophet came to him but then he
[1:21:31] proved to them that Jesus Christ is
[1:21:34] right here in our midst right now
[1:21:36] whether we're on top of the mountain or
[1:21:39] whether we're in the valley whether
[1:21:41] we're aware intellectually aware or
[1:21:44] unaware Jesus crisis in the presence of
[1:21:48] the church right now amen he said
[1:21:50] wherever two or three are gathered in my
[1:21:53] name I will be there in the midst of him
[1:21:55] then right now Jesus Christ is in this
[1:21:59] building and I believe he's here more
[1:22:01] than I believe you're setting the left
[1:22:03] view Amen my eyes could deceive me but
[1:22:07] the word could never deceive me and if
[1:22:09] God said he's here then he's here right
[1:22:11] now
[1:22:12] and if you start focusing on his
[1:22:15] presence and you start just saying I'm
[1:22:17] always here and you begin to worship
[1:22:19] only after just a little while it'll
[1:22:22] begin to break in on you didn't you see
[1:22:24] that the declaration of his presence is
[1:22:26] higher than just the way we feel but
[1:22:30] brother Ram said my ministry is to
[1:22:32] declare
[1:22:34] to you that he is here amen in other
[1:22:37] words brother man's whole ministry which
[1:22:40] was put to the point to prove to you
[1:22:42] that you are in the presence of Jesus
[1:22:45] Christ right now
[1:22:48] amen do you say Amen what difference
[1:22:51] does it make do you see when you see
[1:22:52] that when you see that you're in his
[1:22:55] presence it will affect you in a way a
[1:22:57] man that'll bless you and then it'll
[1:23:00] change your realities it'll change the
[1:23:02] way you think about things when you go
[1:23:05] in the scripture and you look and you
[1:23:07] can see me and who went in the presence
[1:23:09] of God men who became aware of the
[1:23:12] presence of God amen I go into the Book
[1:23:14] of Isaiah and I see Isaiah and how that
[1:23:17] Isaiah one day in desperation I tell you
[1:23:21] amen have you ever come to desperation
[1:23:23] there's a place to go when you're
[1:23:25] desperate right amen and the place you
[1:23:28] go when you're desperate is you go to
[1:23:30] the house of God just like Isaiah did
[1:23:33] and Isaiah went to the house of God like
[1:23:36] he had a lot of times but this time he
[1:23:39] come with a prayer of desperation and
[1:23:42] when Isaiah began to pray on the stair
[1:23:45] on the if the temple the Bible said a
[1:23:47] vision opened up before him and Isaiah
[1:23:51] became aware of the presence of God by a
[1:23:55] manifested vision he looked and saw the
[1:23:58] presence of God feel the temple he saw
[1:24:01] the train of God feel the temple can you
[1:24:04] imagine a man Amen think he was just in
[1:24:07] a church and all of a sudden his vision
[1:24:10] was opened and he was able to see the
[1:24:12] presence of God filled the whole temple
[1:24:15] Amen and you say well well what did he
[1:24:17] see I think it's powerful because when
[1:24:20] you see the presence of God then you
[1:24:22] know there are things presence when God
[1:24:25] is present lot don't come by himself God
[1:24:29] don't come by himself but he has an
[1:24:31] entourage with him Amen do you know that
[1:24:34] when Isaiah saw the presence of God he
[1:24:37] saw the seraphim's
[1:24:39] were there flying around and filling the
[1:24:43] temple which are amen which are a higher
[1:24:45] order of
[1:24:46] angels right Seraphim sigh I know
[1:24:48] there's winged angels and there's we
[1:24:49] angels that's not winged Amen there's
[1:24:52] some somebody said well I don't think
[1:24:53] Angels have wings yes they have wings
[1:24:55] there's some angels that have wings some
[1:24:57] angels don't have wings
[1:24:58] you say how do you know preacher I've
[1:25:00] seen them I've actually seen two in my
[1:25:02] lifetime one day man I just seen one
[1:25:05] down there brother Tim preach the other
[1:25:07] day standing standing right there your
[1:25:09] pastor was sitting next to me he said
[1:25:10] he's here by the way and he's here I
[1:25:12] said I believe you and I acknowledged
[1:25:15] he's here but I didn't see anything to
[1:25:17] say that he was here amen but somewhere
[1:25:19] in the middle of that service I looked
[1:25:21] up and there stood an angel standing by
[1:25:23] the banister looking at the man of God
[1:25:25] preaching and I'm next your pastor and I
[1:25:28] said hey brother Ron hey man I believe
[1:25:30] you I see one the angel standing right
[1:25:32] there watching that man you can see it
[1:25:34] on tape I don't remember which service
[1:25:36] it is but you can see me pointing at it
[1:25:37] in the middle of service and then watch
[1:25:39] the service right after that the service
[1:25:42] went boom amen and what was it it was
[1:25:45] God making himself known he was there
[1:25:48] the whole time
[1:25:49] he's making himself aware the people
[1:25:52] that serve Him now Isaiah saw that he
[1:25:55] saw the presence of God and saw those
[1:25:57] Seraphim zazz they was circle around
[1:25:59] that throng now brother Branham said now
[1:26:01] notice these cell phones because they
[1:26:03] had six wings right with six wings two
[1:26:06] of them covered the face two wings would
[1:26:09] cover the feet and with two wings those
[1:26:12] serums would fly him the presence of God
[1:26:15] so brother Branham says to us amen the
[1:26:18] two wings he said seek covering face and
[1:26:21] feet spoke of both humility and
[1:26:24] reverence humility and reverence a mint
[1:26:29] then he said with two wings he would fly
[1:26:31] so a man when he comes in the presence
[1:26:34] of God he said if he will humble himself
[1:26:36] and he will reverence God then he will
[1:26:39] go into action amen and Isaiah seal at
[1:26:43] brother Branham said watch now he saw
[1:26:45] those angels who had never sinned angels
[1:26:49] who had never been out of the presence
[1:26:51] of God and those angels had to cover him
[1:26:55] and they had to cover their faces
[1:26:57] the presence of God can you imagine
[1:26:59] something as holy as an angel had to
[1:27:03] cover its face in the presence of God
[1:27:06] but the RAM said they had to have a
[1:27:08] special covering to stand there because
[1:27:10] they're the closest thing to God he said
[1:27:14] but listen I want to say something right
[1:27:16] now that the blood of Jesus Christ is a
[1:27:19] sufficient covering and Christ never
[1:27:23] died for a Seraphim but he died
[1:27:26] amen for the created beings he never
[1:27:29] died for the angels he died for sinners
[1:27:31] can you imagine if angels had to have a
[1:27:34] covering in the presence of God what
[1:27:37] about men and women who are born sinners
[1:27:40] how much greater than they need the
[1:27:42] blood of Jesus Christ to stand in the
[1:27:45] presence of God I think God tonight
[1:27:48] Center this morning to know that God has
[1:27:50] covered the church with the blood of
[1:27:53] Jesus Christ
[1:27:54] I do you do you thank God for your
[1:27:56] covering this morning you see you got to
[1:27:59] be covered that's why in the Ark of the
[1:28:01] Covenant amen it was a it was it was
[1:28:03] wood ain't meant covered with gold amen
[1:28:06] brother man said watch now deity had to
[1:28:09] cover humanity amen and when you have
[1:28:12] the blood of Jesus on you that's not a
[1:28:15] human blood applied to you that is the
[1:28:18] blood of God applied to the church that
[1:28:21] they can stand in the presence of God by
[1:28:24] deity covering them then they're
[1:28:27] actually covered by the blood I know
[1:28:30] sometimes we wonder we think about it we
[1:28:32] say well hey man I don't know about
[1:28:33] getting in the presence because it's
[1:28:35] fearful but did y'all know that in the
[1:28:37] Old Testament actually one time of year
[1:28:40] amen they would actually offer their
[1:28:42] sacrifice and they would they would
[1:28:44] actually take the blood out of all the
[1:28:46] sacrifices and they would they would
[1:28:48] gather that blood and then they brother
[1:28:51] BAM said it like this he said they would
[1:28:52] go out and pour it out on the fires of
[1:28:55] Israel Haman in the camp official had
[1:28:57] poured out on the fire he said the blood
[1:29:00] being poured on the fire a smoke would
[1:29:02] go up over Israel they would make the
[1:29:05] fire smoke and when the
[1:29:07] smoke would cover Israel that was a
[1:29:09] moment that all of Israel could come out
[1:29:12] of their tents and they get under that
[1:29:14] smoke and they can begin to worship
[1:29:16] brother man said because God was not
[1:29:18] able to see their sin through that smoke
[1:29:21] he would only hear their voices
[1:29:23] ascending up in the glory I think God
[1:29:26] this morning that the blood of Jesus
[1:29:29] Christ has become a smoke over our lives
[1:29:32] amen that God could not see our sins he
[1:29:36] can only hear our voices as we worship
[1:29:39] through the blood of Jesus Christ amen -
[1:29:43] God you are not a sinner this morning
[1:29:46] you are a child of God under the blood
[1:29:49] of God and you've got every right to
[1:29:51] praise God Amen I tell you sometimes I
[1:29:55] think we forget what the blood sent for
[1:29:57] us it's let us kill in the presence of
[1:30:00] God and rather than hiding in the
[1:30:02] presence we can begin to worship in the
[1:30:05] presence of God we can praise and we can
[1:30:08] rejoice hallelujah we don't have to hide
[1:30:12] ourselves God is here this under the
[1:30:14] blood ain't man and when a man comes
[1:30:17] under the blood a man only thing you
[1:30:19] gotta do it just let go and let God Amen
[1:30:23] am I doing wrong no you really see
[1:30:25] forgiveness you're releasing healing
[1:30:28] you're releasing desire hey man when a
[1:30:32] man comes under the blood hey man I'll
[1:30:34] tell you this sometimes sometimes when
[1:30:37] you a men are preaching it and I know in
[1:30:39] the message of the hour hey I remember
[1:30:41] brother Ron when people didn't rejoice
[1:30:43] like this I remember 20 years ago when I
[1:30:46] first started on the field and if you

[1:30:51] pastors had you in the back talking to

[1:30:57] little turn in that Hey

[1:31:07] face of the earth today they come to

[1:36:24] church we've got a fold in our hand
[1:36:28] we've got a rock in our hand we've got a
[1:36:31] spear in our hand I know they think
[1:36:39] David was crazy when David picked up
[1:36:41] their rocks a man has started down that
[1:36:43] hill because brother branham said David
[1:36:45] danced his way into the battle
[1:36:47] looked like he was dancing himself into
[1:36:50] the face of death and he was dancing in
[1:36:52] the one of the greatest victories and he
[1:36:54] would ever have in his life ain't let me
[1:36:56] tell you something David was appraiser
[1:36:58] David was a dancer but he praised and
[1:37:01] danced and David's holy secret for in
[1:37:04] the presence of God is the fullness of
[1:37:07] joy joy like you've never known not joy
[1:37:10] from your situation not joy from your
[1:37:12] trial Oh see here comes another one

[1:37:21] intellectuals in the last days Amen it's
[1:37:23] too loud do you know what I found out
[1:37:24] this is the quietest place
[1:37:28] this is the quietest place that you're
[1:37:33] ever going to me let me let me warn
[1:37:36] y'all I'm gonna be in heaven I'm giving
[1:37:41] you a warning I'm gonna be in heaven and
[1:37:44] if you think that I'm proud and shouting
[1:37:47] and rejoicing down here you think that
[1:37:52] I'm rejoicing here
[1:37:55] you ain't brother you wait till I put my
[1:37:59] feet on the streets of gold oh the
[1:38:03] battles are over and all the trials are
[1:38:05] home hallelujah I tell you this morning
[1:38:09] Church we've got a right to shout we've
[1:38:13] gotta steal my joy ain't gonna let no
[1:38:27] devil take my praise I'm anointed to
[1:38:30] praise God I'm anointed to rejoice
[1:38:36] oh by the way I think this thing's like
[1:38:49] this there's no out of order you know
[1:38:51] what's amazing to me brother brand picks
[1:38:54] that spirit up in his day and he says I
[1:38:57] want you to watch right here in Isaiah
[1:38:59] he said once y'all see something he said
[1:39:02] these angels were going around the
[1:39:04] presence of God and he said they were
[1:39:07] crying holy holy holy under the Lord he
[1:39:13] said you might have thought they were
[1:39:14] whispering he said you might have
[1:39:17] thought oh they were holy hush
[1:39:19] whispering but a prophet picked it up
[1:39:25] and he said I want you to notice
[1:39:26] something he heard the voice of one
[1:39:29] angel as they have heard the voice of
[1:39:33] one angel and said his voice shook the
[1:39:36] temple but the man said one voice of one
[1:39:39] angel shook the temple he said then what
[1:39:43] about a million of them sounding at the
[1:39:46] same time brother you talking about
[1:39:48] worship you talking about praise when
[1:39:51] you get in the presence of God that it's
[1:39:53] not an end of worship that is the
[1:39:56] beginning of worship he said preacher
[1:39:59] what are you trying to say I'm trying to
[1:40:01] say we got a lot of guys in the end time
[1:40:03] preaching presence presence divine
[1:40:05] presence he's here he's here
[1:40:07] Amen but the next thing you know there's
[1:40:09] no praise there's no worship there's no
[1:40:11] inspiration it turns into dry
[1:40:14] intellectual teaching but let me tell
[1:40:16] you if you really believe he's here he
[1:40:19] is a God of Abraham and he requires
[1:40:22] praise and when a man steps in the
[1:40:24] presence of God he's got to begin to
[1:40:27] rejoice and praise the God that he's
[1:40:29] come into
[1:40:30] oh listen you said well I don't affect
[1:40:39] me like that it's amazing to me because
[1:40:40] I got a Bible I got a Bible you know
[1:40:44] what my Bible says when Isaiah got in
[1:40:47] his presence it affected him when
[1:40:49] Abraham got in his presence it affected
[1:40:51] health when Isaac got in his presence it
[1:40:53] affected him when this little woman got
[1:40:55] in his presence it affected her amen
[1:40:58] when Moses come in the presence it
[1:40:59] affected him wouldn't David done in his
[1:41:02] presence it affected him what I'm
[1:41:04] telling you it should take coming to the
[1:41:06] presence of God without it affecting you
[1:41:08] it's gonna change you it's gonna do
[1:41:11] something wholly inside of you come on
[1:41:15] church you're not a dad and to let your
[1:41:18] people you're the Church of the
[1:41:20] firstborn forged by the holy ghost oh oh
[1:41:27] but it's a long time by the way it's a
[1:41:29] long time that's why God called you an
[1:41:32] eagle you're an eagle do you know that
[1:41:36] tell somebody beside you you're an eagle
[1:41:39] you're an eagle do you know why God
[1:41:42] called you an eagle William Branham said
[1:41:45] this he called you an eagle because he
[1:41:47] said it's the only bird that can go all
[1:41:50] the way down and God would renew its
[1:41:53] youth begin that way he was saying to
[1:41:56] you
[1:41:56] God has a right to call you back to a
[1:41:59] renewing no matter how low you get he's
[1:42:02] got a right to say to you that's enough
[1:42:05] come on up here you've been in the bow
[1:42:07] down coming up here God reserves
[1:42:11] right to defy every devil and tell his

[1:42:37] can't say to me that God can come in the
[1:42:40] building you you can't you you can't
[1:42:45] convince me amen if a man is really
[1:42:49] truly aware of the presence of God he
[1:42:51] will be affected by the presence of God
[1:42:56] unless there's nothing in you brother
[1:43:01] and said the only reason you can't
[1:43:03] strike a match if there's no sulfur on

[1:45:54] way

[1:46:51] children of God we are the children of
[1:46:54] the Most High God we're not stepchildren
[1:46:59] we're not all for children we are black
[1:47:02] hot blurred boring children of the Most
[1:47:06] High pop no we're not babies were not
[1:47:11] instance we are full mature sons that

[1:47:15] Oh people's well I seen the glory of God
[1:47:20] well they they say they sing the glory
[1:47:22] of God but then turn the intellectual
[1:47:25] and then turn and preach against the
[1:47:29] very thing that brings delivered that
[1:47:35] brings life do you think about this now
[1:47:38] and some 16 David said I put the Lord
[1:47:41] always before me you know why that man
[1:47:45] live the way he live cuz God was before
[1:47:46] him he was actually conscious he was
[1:47:50] actually conscious of the presence of
[1:47:53] god do you know what william branham did
[1:47:54] he made you conscious
[1:47:56] he made you conscious sitting in him in
[1:47:58] a building somebody under a load like
[1:48:00] they'd never been under and brother man
[1:48:01] would say sitting there sitting right
[1:48:03] back here in the back has a lot of
[1:48:04] hanging over your heads you're praying
[1:48:06] about certain certain things it's your
[1:48:07] daughter and he starts going through it
[1:48:09] like that and a woman starts going
[1:48:10] somebody's here besides that man and
[1:48:13] they become conscious do you think that
[1:48:16] God came right the inner was he already
[1:48:18] there and a prophet was just unveiling
[1:48:20] his presence to the people glob was
[1:48:24] unveiling something to them now notice
[1:48:26] this because sometimes Amen we get into
[1:48:30] places and the enemy has to say but
[1:48:31] let's say Chester God is leaving us God
[1:48:34] is God is gonna leave us to our own
[1:48:35] devices let me just let me just first of
[1:48:38] all say that is absolutely false
[1:48:41] teaching then ain't nothing but the
[1:48:45] devil let me give you the word the word
[1:48:46] said a little while and the world seeth
[1:48:49] me no more but you shall see me for I
[1:48:51] will be
[1:48:53] with you even in you until when until
[1:49:01] when until the first strong battle until
[1:49:04] the first problem under the first
[1:49:06] trouble you come until the first failure
[1:49:08] I love William branham's message because
[1:49:10] brother madam turned over in Ephesians
[1:49:12] and said the Bible said grieve not the
[1:49:13] Holy Spirit were your prophet well
[1:49:15] you're sealed unto the day of redemption
[1:49:19] but the man said then you're sealed up
[1:49:22] not from revival to revival but you're
[1:49:25] sealed up til you get there you've
[1:49:27] sealed up in other words you are God's
[1:49:30] private property you are God's private
[1:49:38] property and the devil can trespass but
[1:49:43] he can't stay Amen when the devil
[1:49:47] trespasses that's what he does it's like
[1:49:49] a deer hunter knows all the good bucks
[1:49:52] is behind the sign Amen they close the
[1:49:54] fence but the landowner if he's any kind
[1:49:58] of a real God or manager he'll watch for
[1:50:00] that and the first time you sneak over
[1:50:02] the fence
[1:50:03] Amen he'll put you back over he can't
[1:50:06] help you climb the fence but he ain't
[1:50:08] gonna let you hunt on his ground and the
[1:50:11] devil's gonna trespass he's gonna try to
[1:50:14] sneak in but God has angels who are
[1:50:18] circling the camp and every time a devil
[1:50:23] steps in God says send them back
[1:50:26] [Applause]
[1:50:36] send them back now you think about this
[1:50:41] brother man said God's private
[1:50:42] properties the bride he said in
[1:50:44] straighten with trespass on that but God
[1:50:46] has commissioned the church he's
[1:50:50] commissioned the church to say to you
[1:50:51] this is your ground right that's why in
[1:50:54] Joshua the first chapter you'll read
[1:50:57] them say thou shalt not any man be able
[1:50:59] to stand before thee all the days of my
[1:51:01] life as I was with Moses so will I be
[1:51:06] with thee and will not fail thee nor
[1:51:10] forsake thee let me tell you brother
[1:51:14] amen I know Josh was about to encounter
[1:51:17] walls Joshua was about to counter some
[1:51:21] things Amen that nobody probably had
[1:51:23] encountered in their life but you know
[1:51:26] before he took the first step on that
[1:51:28] new ground he already had a promise from
[1:51:30] God as I was shall shall I be Amen in
[1:51:35] other words God was the reason Moses
[1:51:38] part of the waters God was the reason
[1:51:42] that the hailstorm came God is the
[1:51:45] reason that the firstborn of Egypt died
[1:51:47] God is the reason he can bring water
[1:51:50] from Iraq and God was telling Joshua
[1:51:52] look I have been God with Moses but I'll
[1:51:56] be caught with thee
[1:51:58] do you see by the RAM preachers an
[1:52:00] entire sermon has I was with Moses do
[1:52:03] you see what he's saying he's not the
[1:52:05] god that was he is the God that he is a
[1:52:08] man and he's not just a god that was
[1:52:10] he's a God that is and he's a God that
[1:52:13] is with his church right now today
[1:52:18] he is right here his personal presence
[1:52:21] is in the Church of the Living God we
[1:52:26] can say he's on the present couldn't we
[1:52:28] but did what to say that would would to
[1:52:30] sell short what's actually happening
[1:52:32] because God does know all things because
[1:52:35] he's all places amen but it's his
[1:52:37] knowledge that puts him everywhere at
[1:52:39] the same time but don't never don't
[1:52:41] never think Amen that he's he's with you
[1:52:44] the way he's with the Roman Church he
[1:52:47] knows their ever move but he's with you
[1:52:49] in a different way he's with them in
[1:52:52] knowledge of what they will do how they
[1:52:54] will do it he see all-knowing God but
[1:52:56] when it comes to the church he has took
[1:52:59] his personal presence and tabernacled in
[1:53:02] you as an individual because God has a
[1:53:06] temple they said preacher what are you
[1:53:10] saying I'm telling you that there is
[1:53:11] another realm with you when you walk
[1:53:15] down the street there is a tabernacle
[1:53:17] you're a man
[1:53:19] Isaiah song on the presence of God and
[1:53:21] said there's angels flying around him
[1:53:24] and there's chair phones and cell phones
[1:53:26] and there's that's an altar I see you
[1:53:27] realize that when you walk down the
[1:53:29] street there's an entire entourage of
[1:53:33] supernatural beings walking with you
[1:53:35] when you walk down the road come on
[1:53:38] church amen
[1:53:39] either God his tabernacle or not but the
[1:53:42] Balaam said your heart is the throne of
[1:53:45] Almighty God the Spirit is now in your
[1:53:49] heart right now and the presence of God
[1:53:51] is around the church now now if you
[1:53:53] notice this Amen it was this very thing
[1:53:55] that caught the attention of Joshua when
[1:53:57] he said as I was so will I be right as I
[1:54:01] was so will I be it meant in other words
[1:54:03] that God was with him now now you can
[1:54:06] take this little story and it'll show it
[1:54:08] greatly you go back in the time of
[1:54:10] Elijah when Elijah was with with with
[1:54:13] with the children of Israel amen and
[1:54:15] Syria was constantly trying to kill the
[1:54:19] children of Israel Syria was constantly
[1:54:20] trying to get at them amen but God
[1:54:22] anointed a seer among that he would look
[1:54:26] into the other realm and tell
[1:54:28] Israel what Syria was saying in their
[1:54:30] closets he would tell him every battle
[1:54:34] plan Syria had so the Prophet would go
[1:54:37] to the king he would say look King
[1:54:39] serious setup this and they've set up
[1:54:41] this and they set up this amen now what
[1:54:43] you're going to do is you're going to go
[1:54:45] into battle but you don't go the way you
[1:54:46] would normally go you go this way
[1:54:48] amen and the seer was revealing that God
[1:54:52] was present everywhere but God was with
[1:54:55] and Elijah said differently than he was
[1:54:57] with Syria and he was revealing what was
[1:55:01] going on this is amazing to me because
[1:55:03] the moment that Syria began to notice
[1:55:05] something was wrong they said who's the
[1:55:07] spy who's telling all of our secrets
[1:55:11] who's revealing all of our plans
[1:55:13] exposing us in this getting us meet a
[1:55:15] mint so when they decided that it wasn't
[1:55:18] a spy it was a prophet among the people
[1:55:21] they meant you watch the entire Syrian
[1:55:24] army was turned away from the army of
[1:55:28] Israel and attacked the seer of Israel
[1:55:31] they found out the seer had more
[1:55:34] authority than the entire army if you
[1:55:37] kill the vision of the church you can
[1:55:40] kill the church but if you can keep that
[1:55:42] senior alive
[1:55:43] that seer will see you through every
[1:55:46] battle every trial and reveal the
[1:55:49] secrets and look what the seer could do
[1:55:52] that the camp of Israel couldn't reveal
[1:55:54] the unseen could they
[1:55:56] but when Syria decided they kill that
[1:55:58] they kill that prophet now you watch the
[1:56:00] devil weird he turned off his attention
[1:56:02] now against the Sailor right a man a
[1:56:04] prophet of God and everybody's
[1:56:06] criticizing that prophet remember watch
[1:56:08] now here they come to get that prophet
[1:56:11] Elijah and they're down there maybe just
[1:56:13] a little cabin that morning they're just
[1:56:14] cooking and pots and pans and maybe just
[1:56:17] a little bit in the Syrian army comes
[1:56:19] and license not moved at all not
[1:56:21] troubled at all the haze is over about
[1:56:23] to lose it look at all of them look
[1:56:27] what's going to happen how we go amen
[1:56:29] and all the sudden Elijah's not move now
[1:56:31] there's a reason and last
[1:56:33] is not shook because Elijah has been
[1:56:36] stabilized by an unseen world and Elijah
[1:56:40] actually knew that was more with him
[1:56:43] than there was in that Syrian army that
[1:56:45] was coming down the hill and the last
[1:56:47] ship began to say easy fella there's
[1:56:50] more with us than there is with him and
[1:56:52] the man couldn't understand so God amen
[1:56:56] he did to Elijah and Elijah said Lord
[1:56:58] opened the boy's eyes that he might be
[1:57:01] able to see and when his eyes were
[1:57:04] opened he looked into the hills and saw
[1:57:08] that the mountains were full of Chariots
[1:57:12] of Fire now y'all know y'all know what
[1:57:15] that does for a hillbilly don't you Amen
[1:57:17] that means the woods were full of them
[1:57:19] amen they were everywhere behind every
[1:57:21] tree amen though aim in other words amen
[1:57:25] devil you're in trouble because there's
[1:57:27] angels they thought they had Elijah Wood
[1:57:33] a bullet II but God had the army of
[1:57:36] Syria where he will a little god it's
[1:57:39] surrounded them I'll tell you what when
[1:57:42] they got in there and he said open your
[1:57:44] eyes and they begin to see the chariots
[1:57:46] of fires amen now William Branham will
[1:57:48] help you brother Branham will say to you
[1:57:50] he says Elisha did not physically see
[1:57:54] those chariots and Elijah didn't see
[1:57:57] those angels he said but Elisha had read
[1:58:00] the scripture and knew that by the word
[1:58:03] the angels of the Lord in camp about
[1:58:07] them that fear him then he wasn't
[1:58:09] announcing angels because he was seeing
[1:58:12] angels he was announcing angels by the
[1:58:14] scripture the scripture was more real
[1:58:19] than what Elijah could see with his
[1:58:22] natural eyes but he invited Gaza into
[1:58:26] his vision and said Lord let him see him
[1:58:30] and the boy's eyes become open and he
[1:58:32] began to see he began to see that
[1:58:35] were everywhere now can I can I say this
[1:58:37] to you Amen I don't find anything in the
[1:58:39] scripture that said those skills angels
[1:58:42] done anything I don't find in Scripture
[1:58:45] now with the Angels actually did
[1:58:48] anything he meant the only thing that
[1:58:50] happened when that boy's eyes was opened
[1:58:53] was it stabilized something in that man
[1:58:56] Amen that we're in a great battle but
[1:58:59] there's actually more on our side than
[1:59:02] there is on that side let me tell you
[1:59:06] something there's two hundred thousand
[1:59:09] thousand demons against this pride of
[1:59:12] Jesus Christ but let me tell you in
[1:59:16] Hebrews chapter 12 the Bible said we
[1:59:18] have come to Mount Zion and there is an
[1:59:21] innumerable company of angels that is
[1:59:23] with the Church of the Living God I can
[1:59:26] say to you this morning there is more
[1:59:28] with us than there is within I'm saying
[1:59:36] that will you better go back and get
[1:59:38] more because there's something with the
[1:59:41] Bride of Christ amen the anointing of
[1:59:43] the angels of God I'll tell you what
[1:59:47] when you start realizing you're in the
[1:59:48] presence of angels it changes everything
[1:59:51] you'll never study angelology this is
[1:59:53] going to be a free moment right here
[1:59:55] everybody knows about demonology
[1:59:57] what about angelology what about
[1:59:59] angelology brother Brennan said
[2:00:01] demonology was fallen angels right
[2:00:05] fallen angels and those fallen angels
[2:00:07] amen they actually influence the actions
[2:00:10] of people they influence if you ever was
[2:00:15] mad
[2:00:15] that's an influence if you was ever
[2:00:18] jealous that's that influence of a
[2:00:20] fallen spirit it's a demon trying to
[2:00:23] make you feel like Lucifer felt the day
[2:00:26] he will he was jealous of God because of
[2:00:29] his kingdom
[2:00:30] that's an influencing spirit mad jealous
[2:00:34] envy strife and people if they're not
[2:00:37] careful we'll give right away to that
[2:00:38] spirit amen but the Bible said resists
[2:00:42] careful and he will get away from you in
[2:00:46] other words you can resist an angel
[2:00:48] influence and you can say I'm not gonna
[2:00:51] be jealous I'm not gonna be mad are you
[2:00:53] with me you've got a right to resist
[2:00:56] angel influence Amen but if that be true
[2:00:59] in the fallen angel what about the
[2:01:02] angels around the throne of God the only
[2:01:05] thing they ever done was worship God the
[2:01:08] only thing they've ever done is praise
[2:01:10] God and when they fall in a church and
[2:01:13] start circling the building Amen all the
[2:01:16] suddenness and influence coming from
[2:01:18] those angels that make people begin to
[2:01:20] worship and praise and rather than
[2:01:24] resisting them we embrace them you reach
[2:01:30] out you get that angel and pull it into
[2:01:32] you and say charge me with an anointing
[2:01:35] charge me with praise if your battery
[2:01:39] gets low grab an angel charge your
[2:01:42] anointing God charge me to let the place
[2:01:45] of God come into me you see what happens
[2:01:48] in the presence of God mountains begin
[2:01:51] to melt in the presence of God things
[2:01:54] begin to change
[2:01:56] what is it amen amen when praise and
[2:01:58] worship begins to happen the prophet of
[2:02:01] God said you're actually bumping bumping
[2:02:07] into an angel
[2:02:11] can you imagine when you stood and
[2:02:14] shouted and you somebody looks at you a
[2:02:17] little funny I bet you need that you
[2:02:19] need to get your kids right you need to
[2:02:21] remember this you just got bumped by an
[2:02:24] angel in other words something just
[2:02:27] moved by you and cute you now it's time
[2:02:30] to praise now it's time to worship the
[2:02:33] Angels would be worshipping so he's
[2:02:35] saying to you now it's your right
[2:02:39] yeah I don't feel but it's right now I
[2:02:41] don't feel like it boy go ahead and good
[2:02:47] place go ahead please I don't feel like
[2:02:52] it that's when you ought to do it the
[2:02:55] Stars can do it when it's good but moon
[2:02:58] can do it when it's good but the sons of
[2:03:00] God will praise God when they're in the
[2:03:03] lowest place of their life and the dead
[2:03:05] list of everything he's got at field
[2:03:07] level you never heard no praise like
[2:03:14] this I'm the son of the Living God you
[2:03:17] throw everything your God at me but I'm
[2:03:20] still here I'm still in the church I'm
[2:03:23] still praising God I'm still rejoice in
[2:03:26] God and still serving God
[2:03:34] don't forgive me but I just feel like
[2:03:36] preaching I just feel like praising God
[2:03:41] in such a way than ever devil to feel
[2:03:44] uncomfortable in this building ever
[2:03:46] sickness will feel uncomfortable every
[2:03:48] unbelief every feeling about me it'll
[2:03:51] feel so uncomfortable in this go and go
[2:03:55] do you see what's happening is that God
[2:03:58] intends for you to have joy you're gonna
[2:04:02] have your seat just a moment God intends
[2:04:04] for you to have joy you see God is not
[2:04:07] listening I want you I want you to hear
[2:04:09] me very clear here God did not send this
[2:04:12] message to tear you down God did not
[2:04:17] send this message for your life to be
[2:04:19] full of sorrow he did not send this
[2:04:22] message for you to feel like some
[2:04:24] backslidden person all the time God did
[2:04:27] not send this message for you to get in
[2:04:29] the state of legalism where you could
[2:04:31] never worship and praise and fill any
[2:04:33] worship or feel any presence or feel any
[2:04:35] freedom I know what they've done with
[2:04:37] this message they took the message and
[2:04:39] beat the people in submission of men's
[2:04:41] ideas and Nicolette isms and doctrines
[2:04:44] and it chained the people and handcuffed
[2:04:46] them amen but I tell you what God still
[2:04:49] has a true ministry and that ministries
[2:04:51] are going to with a spirit of liberty
[2:04:53] and freedom to turn the children loose
[2:04:55] to worship the way they are designed to
[2:04:58] worship God now now the Bible tells us
[2:05:05] this when the Bible says in John 15 and
[2:05:08] 11 I'm reading the words of Jesus these
[2:05:11] things I have spoken to you that that my
[2:05:13] joy might remain in you and that your
[2:05:17] joy before Jesus said I spoke that you
[2:05:21] might have joy I might my words I spoke
[2:05:24] my words that you might have joy you
[2:05:27] said brother Wayne what does it exactly
[2:05:28] mean you got to back up in Scripture now
[2:05:30] and see what Jesus is talking about in
[2:05:32] John 15 because he's just said I am the
[2:05:35] vine and year of the branch he's just
[2:05:38] said that I'm the vine you're the branch
[2:05:41] and if you abide in
[2:05:43] and my word abiding you then you'll ask
[2:05:47] what you will in other words if God had
[2:05:49] me give any word you couldn't have any
[2:05:52] joy but because he gave word now you
[2:05:56] have the Word of God when you don't have
[2:05:59] anything else you have the promise of
[2:06:02] God when you have no other reason to
[2:06:06] rejoice you've got a promise from God
[2:06:08] that I can rejoice in the darkest hours
[2:06:12] because I've got the Word of God do you
[2:06:14] see the word of God
[2:06:16] is inseparable from God now now this
[2:06:21] this right here is amazing to me because
[2:06:23] when Mary was gonna have a child of a
[2:06:26] virgin
[2:06:27] amen she was going to be a virgin birth
[2:06:29] and they told her you're gonna have a
[2:06:30] child Amen do you know what this is the
[2:06:32] squirrel immediately brought up the
[2:06:34] inability of her to have a child right
[2:06:37] that I don't know how to do this I've
[2:06:39] not known a man but I want you to hear
[2:06:41] what the angel said to her and Luke 1 in
[2:06:43] 37 he said unto her for with God nothing
[2:06:47] shall be impossible for with God nothing
[2:06:52] shall be impossible
[2:06:54] did y'all notice an angel ministered to
[2:06:56] her when God sends angels to minister
[2:07:00] the supernatural is about to take place
[2:07:03] amen every junction of time when
[2:07:06] something great supernatural was
[2:07:07] happening God would send angels on the
[2:07:09] scene do you see what this says for with
[2:07:12] God nothing shall be impossible amen
[2:07:15] that's powerful but when you take it to
[2:07:17] the Greek in a lot your hair for no word
[2:07:22] from God shall be void of power for no
[2:07:27] word of God shall be void of power so
[2:07:30] when Jesus said I gave my word that you
[2:07:33] might have joy he knew my word is not
[2:07:36] void of power God cannot give you a word
[2:07:39] and it's a dead word it's not a dead
[2:07:42] letter
[2:07:42] it is impregnated with life and when the
[2:07:45] word comes into an individual but a life
[2:07:48] of that word
[2:07:49] moves into that heart and causes
[2:07:52] something to happen only inside of them
[2:07:54] no word of God is formal as void of
[2:07:57] power so in other words when God sends
[2:07:59] his word he sends his power amen in the
[2:08:02] book of Nehemiah it's amazing the book
[2:08:04] of Nehemiah when they're coming back to
[2:08:06] the restoration of Israel and they're
[2:08:07] gonna restore Israel in his place and
[2:08:09] true worship is about to be restored
[2:08:12] Nehemiah begins to hold a feast in the
[2:08:15] seventh month and when he does he finds
[2:08:17] that a law of the word and he actually
[2:08:20] comes and opens the word Nehemiah a
[2:08:22] chapter and the Bible said that when he
[2:08:25] began to give it he meant that people
[2:08:27] got an understanding of what he was
[2:08:28] saying
[2:08:29] now the people not having the word in
[2:08:32] such a long time they were so far from
[2:08:35] what the word was until when they got an
[2:08:38] understanding of what the word made them
[2:08:41] to be they begin to cry and become very
[2:08:44] sorrowful but see God didn't send the
[2:08:48] word to tell him how far off they were
[2:08:49] he sent the word to bring them back to a
[2:08:53] promise to bring see God don't send
[2:08:56] somebody to tell you how lost you are
[2:08:58] you already know that he's telling you
[2:09:01] the word to bring you back to the place
[2:09:03] where you can have authority and power
[2:09:06] in the Holy Ghost now I think it's
[2:09:09] powerful if you go read it I think it's
[2:09:11] about the tenth verse he meant the ninth
[2:09:13] and tenth verse but look at what
[2:09:14] Nehemiah actually says to them he says
[2:09:17] unto them listen now he says listen this
[2:09:19] this is a holy day under the Lord your
[2:09:22] God you more not and you weep not for
[2:09:26] all the people went when they heard the
[2:09:28] words of the law and he said unto them
[2:09:30] go your way eat fat and drink the sweet
[2:09:33] and send portions unto them who know
[2:09:35] whom nothing is prepared for this day is
[2:09:38] holy under the Lord neither be you sorry
[2:09:41] for the joy of the Lord is thy strength
[2:09:45] for the joy of the Lord is you see what
[2:09:49] happened when me and my restored the
[2:09:52] word he restored the joy of the church
[2:09:55] he was saying don't let the message be
[2:09:58] sorrowful to you let the message bring
[2:10:01] joy to you oh it ties with revelations 5
[2:10:05] when John sees the Lamb's Book and he
[2:10:08] sees that word not open and John begin
[2:10:11] to reach John began to sorrow and cry
[2:10:13] and weep but when the word was open what
[2:10:16] did he say hey man don't weep John don't
[2:10:20] weep charge the line the tribe of Judah
[2:10:23] had prevailed to take this book and when
[2:10:26] the book was opened up John began to
[2:10:28] rejoice and John begin to shout because
[2:10:32] he saw that the opening of the world
[2:10:35] amen put Hume in the Lamb's Book of Life
[2:10:37] and if a man is in the Lamb's Book of
[2:10:41] Life
[2:10:41] you cannot impute any sin to that name
[2:10:44] you cannot add sin to the name of a man
[2:10:48] who's in the Lamb's Book of Life this
[2:10:50] message didn't come to tell you you were
[2:10:52] lost it come to tell you you were the
[2:10:55] sons of God before the foundations of
[2:10:58] the world according to the Bible and
[2:11:01] Joba 38th chapter where were you when
[2:11:04] the sons of God was shouting for joy
[2:11:07] this is not a mournful message this is a
[2:11:11] message of praise it's a message of the
[2:11:14] Holy Ghost it's a message of power
[2:11:25] the Bible said when John started
[2:11:27] shouting they heard him in the heavens
[2:11:31] and in the earth
[2:11:33] Wednesday night Timothy text me said
[2:11:35] brother Wayne we're about to announce
[2:11:36] that Esther Esther is expecting a baby
[2:11:39] in 16 years after that I tell you what I
[2:11:42] was in that meeting that night I sing
[2:11:44] the the the I sing the agony of that
[2:11:47] child prayed I've seen her in those
[2:11:49] prayer lines reaching out to God seeing
[2:11:51] the disappointment day after day when
[2:11:53] they announced that she was going to
[2:11:55] have a baby I texted brother Tim I said
[2:11:57] did y'all hear me shouting I was in Ohio
[2:12:04] do you see the manifested word brings a
[2:12:09] revelation and revival when God fulfills
[2:12:13] a promise it is done to bring joy into
[2:12:17] the church it's done to bring praise
[2:12:19] into the church amen you see that when
[2:12:22] John saw that word open he begin to
[2:12:24] realize when you hear the bridegroom's
[2:12:26] voice it's the end of a certain season
[2:12:29] and it's the beginning of another season
[2:12:31] and it brought joy see this message
[2:12:34] brings joy I just want to say this to
[2:12:37] you you don't have to manufacture joy
[2:12:41] yeah you don't have to manufacture joy
[2:12:44] amen because the Church of the Living
[2:12:46] God is not here to manufacture nothing
[2:12:48] but matter of fact we're here amen as
[2:12:52] the children of the Living God to only
[2:12:53] produce what's only inside of us amen
[2:12:57] when you look when you look at the
[2:12:58] Scriptures of course amen that God is
[2:13:01] actually brought to the church he's
[2:13:03] brought to the church to a joy in the
[2:13:05] darkest do you think about where we are
[2:13:09] right now we're allowed to see there's
[2:13:12] never been a darker age in all of the
[2:13:15] history of mankind I don't have time to
[2:13:19] preach on the darkness it's too dark
[2:13:22] brother Branham said this is the best
[2:13:24] way to say it there was a boy and a girl
[2:13:26] in the cave and they were way down y'all
[2:13:29] got that cave right over here don't you
[2:13:30] that fella when I was in there in that
[2:13:33] great cavern they turn
[2:13:34] that's off down there and they said we
[2:13:37] just want to see how dark it really is
[2:13:39] and he turn lights off and darkness just
[2:13:41] covers it now brother Branham uses that
[2:13:43] example to explain the age you're living
[2:13:46] in but now notice this in that same
[2:13:50] season Isaiah said darkness covered the
[2:13:54] people gross darkness covers the earth
[2:13:57] he said but watch now at that season you
[2:14:02] should arise and shine because you're
[2:14:07] light the word for your praise the word
[2:14:12] for your joy the word for your life
[2:14:15] shall arise in that season
[2:14:18] other words there's been people that
[2:14:20] worship God in all the ages there's
[2:14:24] people worship God in partial light they
[2:14:26] stood in dark times amen all of that
[2:14:29] listened but there's never been a time
[2:14:32] like the season we're living in right
[2:14:34] now and God knew what he was doing when
[2:14:38] he puts you in the season God actually
[2:14:41] hand-picked you for the darkest of all
[2:14:45] of the seasons in humanity you're living
[2:14:50] in the darkest of all time because you
[2:14:52] know what he knew about you he knew that
[2:14:55] you can put this in the darkest of
[2:14:57] places but you'll never shut her up
[2:15:00] you'll never catch her off you'll never
[2:15:03] stop her from worshiping because she
[2:15:05] knows that her master is on the way
[2:15:11] you see what he says the rise sign for
[2:15:13] glide light amen I I tell you when I get
[2:15:17] to thinking about this I think about
[2:15:18] what we're facing right now and I think
[2:15:21] about the seasons and I think about the
[2:15:23] darkness of loud to see them the
[2:15:25] troubles that are on every hand and when
[2:15:27] you start looking at this you say
[2:15:29] brother Wayne looks like it's getting
[2:15:30] darker and the prophet of God said if
[2:15:33] you don't turn to the light he said
[2:15:37] it'll only get darker and darker as it
[2:15:39] goes he said but to those who turn onto
[2:15:43] the light he said it's only going to get
[2:15:46] brighter and brighter as they go if you
[2:15:51] turn towards the dark it's going to get
[2:15:53] darker and darker are you hearing me the
[2:15:55] darkness will eat you amen death will
[2:15:58] swallow all your victory but if you turn
[2:16:00] to the light the light of swallow the
[2:16:03] darkness the message of the hour will
[2:16:06] swallow that spirit of nervousness but
[2:16:09] spirit of depression this message is
[2:16:11] your victory
[2:16:12] it's your victory it's just sunshine
[2:16:14] it's the Holy Ghost coming to the church
[2:16:18] in the darkest of all seasons he
[2:16:24] hand-picked you to praise Him David sang
[2:16:30] this for you in Psalms 30 he said his
[2:16:33] anger in dearth but for a moment I'll
[2:16:37] tell you what I couldn't help but to
[2:16:38] preach this to you his anger in dearth
[2:16:41] but for a moment can I can I give you a
[2:16:43] little message here God's not angry with
[2:16:45] you more than a moment how many y'all
[2:16:50] got grandkids you got grandkids I've
[2:16:54] seen guys with grandkids I'm almost a
[2:16:56] grand Paul now because I'm getting the
[2:16:58] age of it I'm gonna have some
[2:16:59] grandchildren soon thank you
[2:17:07] now everybody's gonna leave say Zach man
[2:17:09] is expecting I don't have that I don't
[2:17:11] have that buy pregnancy test yet but I
[2:17:13] got that buffet we pray for them deadly
[2:17:28] now let me tell you something else AK
[2:17:30] said to tell you he said tell brother
[2:17:32] Ron I'm gonna send him a postcard with
[2:17:34] our pregnancy test here before too long
[2:17:38] well we might as well believe it I've
[2:17:44] got every right to believe it God did it
[2:17:47] for Esther God did it for Sarah God did
[2:17:50] it for Hanna God did it for all them
[2:17:53] women down through that why wouldn't he
[2:17:55] do it for another child of God his anger
[2:18:02] is only but for a moment
[2:18:04] some of you walk around and I know the
[2:18:07] feeling you think God's mad at you all
[2:18:09] the time can I give you a newsflash he's
[2:18:13] not his anger was kindled at the cross
[2:18:19] his fiery judgment rest upon his son at
[2:18:23] the cross and he took all of God's anger
[2:18:26] against sin on that cross amen in his
[2:18:30] anger if God angers it's only but for a
[2:18:32] law in other words your life is not a
[2:18:35] constant God mad at you
[2:18:37] God's not walking around throwing red
[2:18:40] lines around you if you cross here I'm
[2:18:42] gonna I'm gonna your finish buddy and
[2:18:45] then I hate to say it like this but
[2:18:47] that's your family that's not God amen
[2:18:50] that's the people you know in the
[2:18:51] community that's not God God don't draw
[2:18:54] all these lines and say well if you if
[2:18:56] you think this way or you felt that way
[2:18:58] Amen listen God it's not walking around
[2:19:00] angry at his bride think about this
[2:19:06] because the scripture says his anger
[2:19:08] endureth but for a moment who else could
[2:19:11] say that
[2:19:12] David who watched his what's his
[2:19:16] disobedience bring a plague into his
[2:19:19] season but it was over in the night god
[2:19:23] only let it last so long amen notice
[2:19:26] this his anger and desperate for a
[2:19:28] moment but watch what David says but his
[2:19:30] favor is for a life I'm not living in
[2:19:34] God's anger and once in a while he gives
[2:19:37] me favor I'm living in his favor my
[2:19:41] whole life is in his favor if he has to
[2:19:44] correct me once in a while he's just
[2:19:46] like a granddad corrected a little kid a
[2:19:48] mentor her father corrected a child he's
[2:19:51] not living his whole life angry and
[2:19:54] upset and I know I have enough critics
[2:19:56] somebody get a hold at what God's not a
[2:19:57] great Paul and I agree he has sons but
[2:20:00] you got to remember those sons are
[2:20:02] bought by the blood amen and you noticed
[2:20:06] this because he said his favor is for a
[2:20:09] life now what's what it says weeping may
[2:20:13] endure for a night well I'll tell you
[2:20:16] what when I read that I thought I'd just
[2:20:18] take off shouting weeping endure for a
[2:20:22] night in other words think of this now
[2:20:23] you got a small house and you only got a
[2:20:25] couple bedrooms and you and your wife's
[2:20:28] in one of them amen and you in your mom
