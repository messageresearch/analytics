Let us go to the prayer request here this evening. We want to be remembering our brothers there in Canada up there sharing the gospel. We pray that the Lord just bless those meetings there with brother Ron Andrew and brother Matt as they're up there spreading the good news. We want to be remembering brother Ron and the fight that he's in. Our brother Jeff Breeden, our sister Terresa Delaney, and sister Wanda Hinkle. We want to be lifting them up for the fight that they have. the elderly in the church. We want to please remember brother Randy tonight in prayer. He has a respiratory infection. Thank you, Sister Wanda. Dear church family, please keep Jada in your prayers. She's having a lot of sinus issues. Thank you, Sister Jamie. I know my dad's at home this evening. He's not feeling well. He would love if we would take him to the Lord in prayer dance. also got something he's been fighting for a while. Maybe you have an unspoken request this evening on your heart. You'd like to lift it before the Lord. Our hands, God knows each and every need. Lord, I'd like to ask brother Chris Morris if you would come take these prayers to the Lord for us this evening. As brother Chris prays, you pray too. Take one of them on your heart. I believe he hears our prayers and answers them. &gt;&gt; We believe that. Amen. Amen. Let's all just pray and believe together. Our gracious father, as we just come to you, Lord, and Father, what a mighty God we serve. And Lord, what a mighty God that knows the end from the beginning. And Father, you want us to come and and ask in abundance so our joys might be full. But Lord, there's some sick sheep here. and father by cancer and what the devil's put on these brothers and sisters and we just praying father that we know there's nothing too hard for you and cancer is just a toothache we just ask you Lord just to come and meet the needs of your children and father we know as we see the closeness of the hour we see the times at hand we see father handwriting on the wall and lord Lord, it just can't be much longer that this little bride's got to suffer all the elements of this life. But, Father, one day we'll get a new body. One day soon, Lord, the trials will be over. And if we knew the the big picture, if we knew what was in store, if we really knew down in our heart, Father, things attitude would be different. And we're just praying, Lord Jesus, tonight, Lord, that you'll come and help us. And father, there's one in here, just one. If there's more, there's wonderful, but Lord, if there's one that don't know they got the Holy Ghost, that don't know they're saved. Lord, the body's going to get sick. It'll get sick. It will get healed and get sick. But Father, you do the healing. But Father, that soul, their destination is one breath away from an eternal decision. So, Father, we're asking you, Lord, to find that last one as Brother Ron and Brother Andrew and Brother Matt's up there in Canada preaching. And Father, it may be that the last one's up there. &gt;&gt; And if it is, Lord, we're ready to go. And Father, we just pray Lord for Brother William. &gt;&gt; May the my brothers step aside, Lord. You got a vessel you can use, a vessel that can feed your sheep. And Lord, you know what we've went through this week. You know what we went through last week. And Father, you know what we're going to go through. So, Father, use our brother in a special way. Lord, bless him, we pray. Bless the service. We ask in Jesus Christ's name.

And we're here tonight. and we got an opportunity to reach out and touch the Lord. Won't you stand with me as we prepare here in a moment to invite Brother William? You know, the Lord, he ain't about wasting his time. So, if we're here, he's got a word for us tonight. &gt;&gt; And all we got to do is pull on that gift.

Jesus, I surrender all. Jesus, I surrender all. Jesus, I surrender all the kingoms of my heart. Jesus be Lord of all. Jesus be the Lord of all. Jesus be the Lord of all. Jesus be the Lord of all. The kingom of my heart. Amen. Is that your desire this evening to let the Lord Jesus be the Lord over all? Amen. And you know, for him to be Lord, you got to open every every door to your heart. &gt;&gt; He wants He don't just want to be your savior. He wants to be your Lord and Savior. Amen. God bless you. It's so good to see your smiling faces in the house of the Lord. It's certainly an honor and privilege to be gathered together. Amen. On this Saturday evening, trust you all had a wonderful week. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We want to continue to remember our pastors there in Canada as they minister the word of the Lord. that God will just strengthen them and bless them and bless the meetings as as we know he is. And he's just so faithful. &gt;&gt; He's faithful in Canada. He's faithful in Africa. He's faithful in China. And he's faithful in Virginia. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. If you'll just we'll just go to the word of the Lord. Thank you, musicians. Go to the word of the Lord. And we'll read in several places here, but we'll begin with Amos 3. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Malachi 4. some very very familiar passages of scripture there. Trust it'll be a blessing to you. Amos 3:7, the Bible says, "Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealth his secret unto his servants, the prophets. The lion hath roared, who will not fear? The Lord God hath spoken. Who can but prophesy? Amen. In Malachi chapter 4, we'll begin with verse five. Most of us could probably quote this by heart. But you know, even though so common, even though it's so common to us, we could quote it by heart. May it never become common to our hearts. &gt;&gt; Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord. And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse. How many of you identify with that scripture? &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our heads and our hearts. &gt;&gt; Dear gracious heavenly father, as we come, Lord Jesus, in your presence and father god, Lord, we just realize and are so conscious of our insufficiency, Lord, and we just put all we cast all of our cares upon you, Lord. We look unto you for this service. You've gathered us together here, Lord. You've placed these simple thoughts upon my heart for a reason. And Lord, I just pray that you help me, Lord God, to get out of the way. Bless your people. May they just hear the word of the Lord, Father. Not from a man, but Lord, from the mind of God. We just pray that you close my mouth to anything, Lord, I shouldn't say. And Lord, may you just open my mouth to everything I should. We love you. We give you all the praise, honor, and glory in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless you as you're seated. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Tonight, with the help of the Lord, I just have a very simple thought here. I like to title this, what is the message? &gt;&gt; What is the message? You know, we our church is growing and and and there's there's new people amongst us and and I just was kind of praying and asking the Lord what I I what what to share on and he kind of put this on my heart and it wouldn't leave. &gt;&gt; It wouldn't leave. So, I felt like there's a reason for it. So, that's what I just like to preach on. What is the message? And it's not just for those that say maybe new amongst us, but even for those of us that have grown up in it, that have been around it. May may I pray that the Lord will just help us to receive something fresh and maybe if nothing else, have a new appreciation for the message of the hour because the truth of this message and what God has done for us can never ever be overemphasized. &gt;&gt; God has called us out. And may may this also just be as as a foundation because every Christian needs a foundation because you go out there and you get amongst all kinds of people and Satan will test you. &gt;&gt; You read your Bible and you read something and the enemy will come to you and test you on your faith. Brother Jerry, you'll hear the prophet say something and the enemy is going to test you on your faith. So I think it's very important for us to have a strong foundation in what we believe and why we believe it. we must understand, you know, and then as as when when these other brothers get up and they begin to preach and God has placed a powerful message on their hearts, they may just drop some details and maybe mention a word or maybe mention the third pull and keep going. They're under the anointing and God's given them a sermon. So, I pray that this sermon will kind of take a step back and lay a foundation and give you a background to where when they mention something, you understand it. Because whenever you understand what's being preached, that's real faith. &gt;&gt; Okay? To understand and be able to grasp and say, "I get it." And that's why we should always be in the word. You read during the week. You you keep your mind on the Lord and you come to church and you'll hear things that you are having a very private discussion with your spouse, your family, maybe even the Lord himself. So again, may this just be a basis because even though we've heard it in our own lives, our whole lives, it's important to understand. Amen. The scripture says in second Peter 1:16, "For we have not followed cunningly devised fables when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This message lives. That's right. &gt;&gt; This message is freedom. This message is literally the love of God to you. &gt;&gt; When millions, the prophet would make a statement like this. Millions died the day I was saved. &gt;&gt; Millions go to the grave and have never heard this message. &gt;&gt; But yet God in his grace has allowed it to cross your path. That's right. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would make a statement in the church age book and he would say, "I wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I believe that puts a conviction on all of us. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we get so used to to hearing truth and we love the truth, but you don't we don't we we sometimes can lose lose sight of how what the famine that is out there, &gt;&gt; the famine for the truth and the word. and we go home and we listen to it and we read it and we hear sermons and we're just such a blessed people. &gt;&gt; We're not just another church, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; We are the bride of Jesus Christ. We believe the message of the hour. But what does this mean? How does this separate us from every other Christian church and denomination? &gt;&gt; Now, let me say this. God has an economy. &gt;&gt; And there will be millions and millions of people in heaven and saved that have never heard this message. &gt;&gt; But once it's crossed your path, &gt;&gt; you're then responsible for it. &gt;&gt; The people that have never heard it and all they know is the preaching of the cross and the fundamental teaching of the Bible and they accept and they believe and they're saved, that's their that's their portion. But for us, God has given us something special. &gt;&gt; Now Jesus would make a statement in St. John 15:22. If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin. But now they have no cloak for their sin. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; The prophet of God would make would would would say something really powerful in a sermon called God's word calls for a total separation of from unbelief. And he makes this statement. He says, "You pull out a bunch of change." He said, "There's pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters, half dollars, dollar, all in coins." Now, that's what the world is in God's hand. He said, "There are some people that can just have a penny's worth of it, and God can only use them in a penny way. &gt;&gt; That's all they can buy. Don't reject them." That's right. &gt;&gt; If they can't believe the real truth, don't turn them down. Don't kick them out and say they're not in it because God uses pennies sometimes. &gt;&gt; Now, this isn't an arrogant quote. This isn't an arrogant statement to say, you know, oh, you're a penny. But this is actually a very inclusive quote. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; This is a very inclusive quote because we need the pennies. &gt;&gt; We need the nickels. We need the dimes. We need the quarters. They're in God's economy. The important thing is that they're in God's hand. &gt;&gt; That's right. There it is. &gt;&gt; And as long as they're in God's hand, God has a use and God has a purpose for them. &gt;&gt; But now he goes on, he says, "Lot was just a penny. Abraham was a silver dollar." &gt;&gt; So it's taken a 100 lots to make an Abraham. A hundred carnal believers. And so will it take a hundred carnal believers will never stand in the presence of a genuine Christian. that's separated from the carnal things of the world, living in Jesus in Christ Jesus where the word can flow through him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The bride is a silver dollar in his hand. &gt;&gt; But don't reject if your neighbor's a nickel. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Appreciate the nickel. &gt;&gt; Pray for the nickel. &gt;&gt; God has a purpose for him. &gt;&gt; But we're But God has called us to be the bride. And we say that humbly because that's what he did for us. &gt;&gt; St. John 1:1, in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God. Now the keystone of the Bible is the revelation that God never changes. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad to ser be servant of God that never changes? &gt;&gt; He He's predictable. Now sometimes he does paradoxes and he can work in unexpected ways but he is very he will fulfill his word and what he did yesterday he's going to do today and he'll always do. &gt;&gt; Now there's three races of people in the world. There's there's gentile there's Jews and there's Samaritans. &gt;&gt; Now when God came in the flesh in the Lord Jesus Christ he expressed himself in the Jewish nation of Israel. Amen. And what did the Jews do? We know they crucified him. They rejected him. And after the days of Pentecost, whenever the ministry of Jesus Christ was then transferred from his own flesh into the apostles and the 120, the Jews continued to reject the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; So in Acts 13, Paul turned he said that be the the Jews kept coming against kept coming against the word. So he says the Gentiles were loving it, &gt;&gt; but the Jews were rejecting it and constantly trying to stone him and hated for it. And so Paul stood there as a prophet messenger and said, "Lo, we now turn to the Gentiles." &gt;&gt; And and and right now we're on the cusp of low, God is turning back to the Jews, but there's still we're still in the dispensation of the Gentiles. All right. &gt;&gt; Now, after Pentecost in the in in the region, there were seven there were a bunch of churches, but in particular, there were seven physical, geographical, literal churches, &gt;&gt; right, &gt;&gt; that existed. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; And these churches were so prophetic in in the in in their their ways they would approach the word. God, they actually prophesied of entire ages to come, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Like the first church age is the Ephesus church age, the Ephesians, but there was literally a church in Ephesus. &gt;&gt; And the first church in Ephesus there, they begin to drift away and lose the passion and the love for the word. And so they literally forecasted, Sister Stephanie, they literally forecasted the entire Ephesian church age by their actions. &gt;&gt; Amen. And there were seven churches and God put them in the Bible in the book of Revelation and he named them all and they were to project future ages. Right? &gt;&gt; In Revelations 1, we'll read in verse 10, John speaking, I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet, saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last. what thou seeest, write in a book, and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia, unto Ephesus, and into Somra, and unto Pergamos, and into Titara, and to Sardis, unto Philadelphia, and unto Leodysia. And I turned to see the voice that spake with me being turned, and I saw seven golden candlesticks. Now, these seven golden candlesticks, each candlestick represented a church age, &gt;&gt; right? And Jesus himself later in the book of revelation there he actually interprets it there that says that the seven candlesticks that you seen are the seven church ages. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. And then and then in verse verse verse four of chapter one John to the seven churches which are in Asia. Grace be unto you and peace from him which is and which was and which was which is to come. and from the seven spirits which are before the his throne. Now, seven spirits refer to the continuous ministry of the Holy Spirit in the lives of seven men. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Whom God identifies himself very closely. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; There are seven church ages and there's seven church age messengers. That's &gt;&gt; right. that God sends to every single age. &gt;&gt; This is really fundamental &gt;&gt; but I want us all to really grab a hold of it &gt;&gt; now. The seven spirits are not seven separate spirits. &gt;&gt; They are the same spirit but given in seven portions. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; So whenever the fir whenever the Ephesus age needed it, God would release his messenger and release the spirit with that messenger. Now, each church age messenger, as I said, he had a he was a special handpicked man that God would use to get the people back to the word and they were represented in the scripture as stars. In Revelation 1:16, it says, "And he had in his right hand, which is a symbol of power, he had seven stars." And Jesus later interprets that and says, "The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand and the seven golden candlesticks, the stars are the angels of the seven church ages. And the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven church ages, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; So they're in his right hand. &gt;&gt; And as as the church age began, God needed to keep because God is concerned about his bride and his wife." &gt;&gt; Amen. And the first bride, Eve, she fell. &gt;&gt; And God wasn't going to have another Eve to fall like that. &gt;&gt; So whenever she started to drift away, God then begin to release messengers and stars. He then released a star for each age. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Now there there also whenever the Bible talks about the eyes, there's seven spirits. There's seven stars. There's seven eyes. The stars and the spirits, they represent the the the the seven spirits. Each spirit represented and came with the star. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; But it was all the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And Psalm 32:8 says, "I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go. I will guide thee with mine eye." &gt;&gt; So God would release the star. Ephesus, he released Paul. Then time went by. Samrna, he released Ireneius. Then Pergamos came and he released Martin. Thyra came, he released Columbus. Sardis came, he released Martin Luther. Philadelphia came, he released John Wesley. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then Leosa. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; He released William Brandham. &gt;&gt; Do you hear me? hell. &gt;&gt; He released William Brandon &gt;&gt; and we're not ashamed of that. &gt;&gt; We're not ashamed of this message. &gt;&gt; We love this message. We love the prophet and we love the message he brought &gt;&gt; and we believe it with all of our hearts and it's going to change our bodies. That's right. &gt;&gt; Now that this book, this Bible was sealed with seven seals in Revelations 5. It was sealed with seven seals. And God held this book sealed throughout all the ages because it's opening tied to his coming. &gt;&gt; All right? &gt;&gt; And so he hid it hid because remember when he was on the earth, he said, "No man knows when when the father's coming. Not even the angels in heaven know." It was such a secret. And he held it sealed for seven church ages. But at the end of the seventh church age, God releases a seventh star. Because look, Paul was not just a messenger. Paul was a prophet messenger. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And then through the church ages, you had reformers. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; They weren't prophet messengers. There were someone that that God had his hand on, and they were to keep the elect pure for every age. But at the Alpha and the Omega, God sends a special man. a prophet messenger to get the word in order. The pillar of fire was identified with Paul and the pillar of fire is identified with William Brandham. &gt;&gt; So this Bible was sealed with seven seals and no man was even worthy to look on it. In Revelations 5, John is weeping and wailing because no man is worthy and it's got to be unsealed. It's got to be open if we're to be redeemed. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; All the Old Testament saints are all waiting. We're all waiting. The New Testament saints that have died during the church age, we're all waiting for this for the lamb to come take the book. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; But there was a promise. Don't you love it when when there's a problem, but then God has already got the promise and the answer already here. &gt;&gt; The answer is already there. The answer to all of our problems is already here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We've just got to believe it. We've got to take it for ourselves. But in Revelations 10:7, it says, "But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets." &gt;&gt; Revelations 10 is the same like Malachi 4. Now look, his ministry was not an exactly a specific truth, but it was to gather all the loose ends. the church ages they there were they were to to keep the elect pure as pure as possible while the book was still sealed but they didn't have all of the truth there were still some things let me give you an example Martin Luther baptized in titles people were baptized in titles and God still gave them the Holy Ghost why would God do that because the book was sealed &gt;&gt; right now &gt;&gt; they didn't know any better but now we know &gt;&gt; now we know better. Now, God's not going to accept Father, Son, and Holy Ghost baptism. He ain't going to give you the Holy Ghost with Trinity baptism. Why? Because the book's open. And now we know better. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, the prophet's ministry, this this put a lot of pressure on me, Brother Matt, because to take a title like this, what is the message, and try and have an hour to try and bring it all together without missing the important parts, you talk about stress. So if I miss your favorite parts, please forgive me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because what is the message really is every sermon that's preached across this pullpit. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's it it it's preaching to us what the message is. It's just from a different angle. But to from a factual fundamental standpoint to take what is the message and bottle it all down to one hour is was very difficult. and we'll just get as far as we can. Y'all pray for me. &gt;&gt; But now, why did we need a restoration? &gt;&gt; Why did God have to send a prophet? Because remember when as soon as remember the the day of Pentecost was like the Garden of Eden. So whenever God created Adam and there that masterpiece was just so beautiful, Satan wasn't going to stick around and let that happen. He came in and he spoiled the picture. &gt;&gt; Well, when the when the day of Pentecost came, 120 people, the entire church had the Holy Ghost and they were out tearing up Satan's kingdom, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Satan wasn't going to leave it that way. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So, he began to eat and he began to the Antichrist spirit. You read the first, second, the epistles of John. The antichrist spirit then was already beginning to work. &gt;&gt; And John was beginning to warn them, watch out for that antichrist spirit. If any spirit comes around and says that Jesus is not the Christ, that is that Antichrist spirit. Be careful, little children. Watch out. He's going to come among you. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; So, what happened? That's what he did. They in Ephesus, they already begin to drift. And what happened? The next church age, they drifted more and they drifted more and they drifted all the way into a dark age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why was it called the dark ages? Because people didn't have access to the word. That's &gt;&gt; right. You could literally be burned to the stake for owning one of these. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; For translating one of these, &gt;&gt; you could literally go to the guillotine. You could literally go into the coliseum, whatever form of persecution. Now, God had that anointing there for them, but it was the dark ages. So, the the it was eaten all the way down in Joel 2:25, it tells about it. It was eaten all the way down to the stump. And God had a promise laying there again. And he said, "I will restore." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God is a God of restoration. He's going to restore. He said, "All in verse 25, and I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the cankerworm, the caterpillar, and the palmer worm, which my great army, which I sent among you. and ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that hath dealt wondously with you and my people shall never be ashamed. &gt;&gt; When Adam and Eve fell in the Garden of Eden, did he leave it like that? &gt;&gt; When the second Eve fell after Pentecost, not after the as the apostles are starting to die, they begin to fail. Did God leave it like that? He didn't leave it like that. That's &gt;&gt; right. So there had to come to return us back to the faith that once was delivered to the saints. The faith that Paul has, you have. &gt;&gt; The faith that Peter had, you have. &gt;&gt; The faith that John had, you have. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The same Holy Ghost. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; That literally the literally the same Holy Spirit, brother Timothy, that fell on the day of Pentecost. we have access to &gt;&gt; literally not figuratively not spiritually it is spiritual but what I mean is it's the literal life of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; that's right there &gt;&gt; think about how wonderful that is &gt;&gt; now this church age saints still had the Holy Ghost but it wasn't in this it wasn't with this truth that's why they had to go by way of the grave because only the full word can take a body change a rapture What did the Bible say about Enoch? That he walked with God and that God changed him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And when you read about the heroes of faith, it says that Enoch pleased God. &gt;&gt; And it pleased God. It pleased God to change him. Now, God uses God sent Elijah more than once. God uses the spirit of Elijah five times in the Bible. &gt;&gt; That's right. There was Elijah, Elisha, John the Baptist, William Brham, and the last Elijah that's going to go. And Elijah when he goes back to the Jews five times, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That spirit served him so well that he sent it again. &gt;&gt; Right? But and and watch each time that an Elijah ministry is on the earth, there's always an Ahab and a Jezebel to go with it. Have you ever noticed that? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Ahab and Jezebel was was with Elijah and Elisha. &gt;&gt; You had Herod and Herodiius &gt;&gt; with John the Baptist. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have modern day Ahab, USA. Modernday Jezebel, the Catholic Church. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's going to go all the way to the end. Elijah that goes to the Jews is going to have to deal with the same Ahab and Jezebel. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because remember Herod, he he actually secretly admired John the Baptist. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just like whenever Elijah pronounced Ahab's doom, Ahab humbled himself. But that Jezebel was controlling him. Now in Matthew 17 verse 10 and his disciples speaking about John the Baptist asked him saying why then say the scribes that Elijah must first come and Jesus answered and said unto them Elijah truly shall first come and restore all things. That's brother Brandham right there &gt;&gt; he shall surely come. That was future. Now watch the next verse in verse 12. But I say unto you that Elias Elijah is come already. There's your John the Baptist. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they knew him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they listed. Likewise shall also the son of man suffer of them. Now God not only had to raise the seventh church age messenger, but God even had to reveal to the messenger who he was. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He didn't just walk out. He was born of a woman, born in sin, shaped in iniquity, came to the world speaking lies. He had the same life that we all did. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But it was just a little bit different, wasn't it? &gt;&gt; When he was born, the pillar of fire came over his crib. &gt;&gt; Followed him as a child. When he was about six or seven years old, remember he was carrying cedar buckets on the way to his father's moonshine. Still God don't care. &gt;&gt; He's after his elected. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; He could have been carrying him to church if he wanted if if that was God's plan. But it was a moonshine still &gt;&gt; and a whirlwind came down in a tree and began to talk to him and say, "Don't ever smoke. Don't ever drink. Don't defile your body in any way because when you get older, there's a work for you to do." And as a six-year-old boy, that's about Wesley's age. He took off running to the house and he was scared. He thought a man was in that tree. &gt;&gt; Well, there it was. So later in life, he becomes a Christian. But the visions that he has in life never go away and they're always accurate. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Things that, you know, God was teaching him from a young age that he would be living and where he would be living and all these different things. And and you can go listen to how the angel came to me and his life story and get every beautiful detail. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But all the preachers that were around him that he respected constantly in his life told him it was the devil and to stay away from it. &gt;&gt; Right? And that really tore him up. &gt;&gt; That tore him up so bad that he finally said he had enough. He went in a cabin in the woods and he said, "I'll never come out until God takes this away from me." Because he said, "I don't want to be a devil." He said, "I love God." But the people that he respected told, "Billy, you stay away from that." But yet when he would come around &gt;&gt; other palm readers and stuff, the devils recognized &gt;&gt; the gift in his life. So, he's in that cabin and he's praying all night and asking God, think of this. He's in that cabin as a minister, as a Baptist minister, and he's asking God, he said, "God, please, whatever this is, I keep seeing these visions and whatever, when I feel it come on me, I can't help it, but whatever it is, please take it away from me." And he's begging and pleading with God to take this thing away from him. the very gift &gt;&gt; that God put in his life. He's begging God to take it away from him. &gt;&gt; And all of a sudden, the light comes. And at first, he's in a dark cabin. He's in the woods, tucked away. There's no way that could be a flashlight or anything. And in that light, out of that light, steps an angel. That's right. &gt;&gt; And this angel, when God sends an angel, he's got a purpose. &gt;&gt; When he sent the angel to Mary, he had a purpose. And I'm going to read the quote because he says he was there and he says it best. He said, ' And he looked at me and he said,"Do not fear, for I am sent from the presence of Almighty God said to tell you that your peculiar birth and life has been to indicate that you're to take a gift of divine healing to the peoples of the world." Now listen, if you'll be sincere when you pray and get the people to believe you, when people would come in the prayer line, what would be one of the first things that he would say? Do you believe me? &gt;&gt; Do you believe that what I've said is the truth? &gt;&gt; Because if that person did not believe, &gt;&gt; they couldn't be helped. The same applies today. &gt;&gt; Not just for not just for divine healing, anything from God. It's all based on faith. &gt;&gt; But he but the angel tells him, "Get the people to believe you and nothing shall stand before your prayer, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Not even cancer." The angel specifically in this cancer age mentioned not even cancer. &gt;&gt; So if you believe now God took his servant home but the angel is still here. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The message is still here. It's just as right as the day it was spoken. So your faith in the same message will bring about the same result. That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And Sister Wanda, not even cancer. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, not even cancer. &gt;&gt; We'll be able to stand before our prayers. &gt;&gt; And what what do we have? The prophet begins to make excuses about his inability. And the angel took him through all the scriptures, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Did not our Lord, did not Moses. Then the angel tells him, if you'll be sincere, then it will come to pass that you will tell the people the very secrets of their hearts. Right. &gt;&gt; In June of 1933, he was preaching a revival and he goes and it's hot and he goes and he starts baptizing the Ohio River and he's baptizing all all all the the the trophies, the spiritual trophies of the service. And as he was baptizing the 17th person, that same pillar of fire came down and started churning the water. &gt;&gt; Amen. And in front of all them witnesses, a voice came out and it said, "As John the Baptist was sent to forrun the first coming of Christ, your message will forrun the second coming." Where was John the Baptist at whenever Jesus came to him? The river &gt;&gt; baptizing. &gt;&gt; Where was the brother Brandham in the same spirit of Elijah at &gt;&gt; when the pillar of fire, the same pillar of fire? That's right. that was incarnated in our Lord Jesus came down and vindicated the second forerunner. &gt;&gt; If Jesus had a forerunner before his first coming and the keystone of the Bible is that he doesn't change, then he's got to have a forerunner for his second coming. Now, as his ministry grew, so did the impersonators and the critics. But and you know in January of 1950 he was not in a message church there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There were people there was a mixed audience and he was surrounded on that platform by critics. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And God came down. He didn't God didn't have to do that. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; If God didn't do that, that wouldn't have changed his message whatsoever. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But why did he do that? So that the world so on the day of judgment, the world will be without excuse. You even had a picture of it &gt;&gt; without excuse. &gt;&gt; That's why he did it. &gt;&gt; Now Jesus called John more than a prophet. Why? Because he bridged the way between law and grace. &gt;&gt; This message, Brother Brandham was more than just a prophet. I'm not making him God, &gt;&gt; but he was a prophet messenger. That's &gt;&gt; right. because he was bridging the way between the church ages and the coming of the Lord. That's right. &gt;&gt; With a message to turn our hearts back. &gt;&gt; Now, God has an elected seed on the earth. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Remember when God created in the book of Genesis, he created everything. The seeds were already in the earth. And then whenever he moved the waters out of the way and he he said, "Let there be light." And the sun begin, brother Noah, the sun begin to shine on the earth. it. All it did was quicken the seeds that were already there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's all the elect are from every age. Whenever the word and the truth of every church age came down in the respective messenger and the messenger was preaching the word, all it did was shine light into the hearts of the elected seed. It brought them to light. It brought them to light. And there could be a seed sitting right there but a rock right next door. &gt;&gt; And the very next seed could be a rock. One springs up and sees it and the other one don't see anything. &gt;&gt; Why? because one has the seed. Now, the elect come from every background. Like I was saying about brother Ram carrying the the water to a moonshine still, every background, every walk of life, every history you can imagine. So God has got to catch the attention of his elected seed called the bride. She's in denominational churches. She's in the world &gt;&gt; everywhere. &gt;&gt; How is God gonna do it? He's going to go fishing. &gt;&gt; He's going to go fishing. When Jesus was on the earth, his ministry had three pools. &gt;&gt; Noah's ministry had three pools. And this end time ministry had three pools. has three pools. &gt;&gt; Now, let me let me just inject this in here real fast. Never be intimidated by anything in this message, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Okay. A as a believer, no, we're all constantly trusting the Lord. We're all constantly learning. There's no such thing as a dumb question. If you ever have any questions, you you come approach us. That's &gt;&gt; right. Amen. &gt;&gt; You ask one of the deacons. You &gt;&gt; We're all a church family here. That's &gt;&gt; right. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we're all in different levels of growth. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; And I pray that God will even interpret even this sermon to the level that even the children can understand. &gt;&gt; It's it's it's very very simple. And if you don't understand something, you just put on the shelf and say, "Lord, you help me understand that in your time." But whatever God gives you to understand, let me tell you, hold on to that. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And then the next time in service, you get something else out of that service. Then you hold on to that. Thank you, Lord. Don't be intimidated by all that you don't understand. and appreciate what you do understand. &gt;&gt; Appreciate what God has given you because that then belongs to you, brother Dylan. &gt;&gt; What God has given you to understand, hold it close &gt;&gt; because that's God whispering his love secrets to you. &gt;&gt; So the three pools are are very simple. It's interesting because in Luke 17 26, Jesus is standing there and he says, "As it was in the days of Noah, so shall it also be in the days of the coming of the son of man." So you had Jesus himself sitting there with three pools in his ministry. Referring back to Noah's ministry that had three pools and to this last day ministry that was going to have three pools. So there, like I said, Jesus, he he was going to go fishing. Jesus likened many of his parables to fishing. He'd he'd start one of his parables by saying, "The kingdom of God is like a man casting his net." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When he called Peter, Andrew, and James, and John, what were they doing? &gt;&gt; Mending their nets. And what did he tell him? He said, "Follow me, and I'll make you fishers of men." So all these all these years and years and years later, his seventh church age messenger loves to fish. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So when the angel one day gives him a vision, he gives him a vision about fishing. &gt;&gt; But the fishing isn't just to make him a better fisherman naturally. The purpose of the vision is because brother Brandham could relate to the fishing and it was to to symbolize three pools of his ministry. &gt;&gt; When you fish, brother Jerry, you pull, right? So each one has got a reason. You work the lure, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Or so I'm told. I'm not a good fisherman. &gt;&gt; Every time I work the lure, I get hung up. But the and the angel of the Lord come comes to brother Brandham here. And I'm going to read it because I I want it verbatim so that you'll understand and catch it. So, Brother is describing the vision. The angel of the Lord has given him this vision. He said, "I was standing there by a side of a beautiful lake, something like your lake out here in the summertime wherein it's real pretty and green, and there were fishermen all around the lake and they were fishing." Now, remember that quote I read to you about change in the hand of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said there were fishermen all around the lake and they were all fishing, but they were catching small fish. &gt;&gt; Amen. God has a purpose for that. &gt;&gt; And I looked out on the lake and those great big those great beautiful rainbow trout out there and I said, I know this is a vision. I can't understand those trout, but I said, you know, I believe right down in my heart I can catch those. So I picked up the string, but instead of it being a string, it was a fishing pole. Just and just then the one behind me said, "Now I'll teach you how to fish and how to catch those." This is where the angel is explaining brother Brandham's three pools in his ministry. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so he took and he said, "Tie the lure." And I snapped the lure on. He said, "Now throw it way out." Listen now. Listen close. Way out into the deep. And he said, "Now when you do, let the lure sink down first. Then said, pull it slow." Now, that's really a fisherman's technique. He said, 'Now, when you do, now you'll feel some nibbles at it, but don't tell nobody what you're doing. Keep it to yourself. And then when you feel the nibble again, he said, "Pull it just a little bit. A little bit. Not too hard." He said, "Then pull it. It'll pull away from the little fish. And when they scatter, that'll attract the tension of the big fish." and they'll grab it. Except you eat the flesh of the son of man &gt;&gt; and drink his blood, you have no part in me. &gt;&gt; What did the little fish do? &gt;&gt; Gone. &gt;&gt; What did the rainbow trout do? &gt;&gt; He said that's the way you'll catch it. said, "When they bite on the third time, set your hook for the catch." So, he had three pulls. Brother Matt, I'm I need you. &gt;&gt; I'm going to use him to demonstrate if you'll just come with me on this side, brother. So, when Brother Brand would operate his prayer lines in the in in in the first pull, he always had people come this way. If you notice, even on the sermons of Deep Call to the Deep in the Chicago campaign, it was always this way. He said because the angel of the Lord always stood on his right side. &gt;&gt; So he wanted the angel of the Lord between him and the patient. &gt;&gt; So the angel told him when he operated the first pull, he said you take your left hand and you hold the patient's right hand. And he said when you do you he would break out like in a rash and in bumps and he would be able to touch and he'd be able to discern what was going on with that person. But he had to physically the the patient had to physically be here and physically grab a hold of his hand and whenever if the bumps would disappear then he can say God bless you you're healed. &gt;&gt; That was the first pull. What did that contact the flesh? &gt;&gt; But remember the prophet said if you'll be sincere there's going to come. The angel told him if you'll be sincere there's going to come a time where you'll know the very secret of their hearts. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; So then it be to transition into the second pull. So when the second pull and the patient would come up, he'd just sit there and he would look and he'd begin to see all of a sudden like if it was brother Matt, he'd go away and he'd see him as a little child or see him what was going on. &gt;&gt; And he would then begin to discern what was in his life, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And that was the second pull. And the pillar of fire would sometimes leave here and and say, "Brother Ram, just pray for somebody." And they left and another patient came up, but then the pillar of fire would go over there &gt;&gt; and he'd have to follow that pillar of fire constantly. That's right. What would he say? He said, "If I can, let me just talk to you a little bit. If I can contact your spirit." That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; The first pull was on the level of the flesh. &gt;&gt; The second pull was on the level of the spirit, the human spirit. &gt;&gt; But the third pull is on the level of the soul. &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Matt. Is on the level of the soul. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't come and have brother Ram discern your problem. &gt;&gt; But that third pool ministry is still in effect. &gt;&gt; That's why you're here &gt;&gt; is because you're that rainbow trout. And when everyone else was scattering 1977 came, think of how many of that scattered &gt;&gt; instead. And see, God uses the the gifts of the ministry and the healing and things to catch the fish's attention, to catch the attention of the rainbow trout. &gt;&gt; But God just didn't send he he the the people benefited from the divine healing. But the whole purpose was to forerun the second coming of the Lord. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; 60 years later, the prophet's gone. People still love the gift. They can't deny the gift. But when it comes to that third pull, they scatter &gt;&gt; because it's only for the bride. What where was Jesus in the book of Revelation at the end of the Leoian church age? Where was Jesus at the end of the church age? Outside &gt;&gt; knocking trying to get back into his own church. So if you want to be with Jesus, you have to be where he is. Jesus, God comes in three sons names. Son of man, son of God, and son of David. It's the same God. All it is is this dispensational. You say, "What is a dispensation?" It is just an amount of time that God allows or allotss to deal with a group of people like the Gentiles and the Jews. So when he came as son of man the first time he was in flesh a prophet. Son of man means a prophet. Then whenever he was crucified and he resurrected and went up to heaven he sent the holy ghost. He became he is still the same god but he now got into the son of god office the spirit the holy ghost. And when he's going to rule and reign on the earth he's literally going to be king of the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's literally going to be sitting on a throne. So you have son of man, son of God, son of David. &gt;&gt; But he made a very special promise to us in between son of God and son of David. He promises that the son of man will be revealed again. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Son of God, son of man, the first coming. Son of God during the church age is the Holy Ghost. Son of David is the future, the millennium when he's going to rule and reign with the bride. That's when you can go and pet a lion. Don't do it now. &gt;&gt; But in between the son of God and son of David, that's where you find Luke 17:30. Even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed. That's what this message is. It's the son of man ministry. &gt;&gt; It is God building in a prophet to turn our hearts back. &gt;&gt; Remember when Jesus was here and he saw Nathaniel coming and he all of a sudden he said, "Behold an Israelite indeed in whom is no G." How did he know who Nathaniel was? He never met him before. But he was the Messiah and that was the sign of the Messiah. And and when Jesus answered and said, "Before that, Philip called you when you were under the fig tree, I saw you." So if he did that then in that son of man ministry, then he's going to do it again in this son of man ministry. &gt;&gt; It's the same works. Amen. &gt;&gt; So Nathaniel answered in in 1 John 1:49, John 1:49, Nathaniel answered and said unto him, "Rabbi, thou art the son of God, the king of Israel." In other words, Jesus is getting ready to say here. He said, "If you think the second pool is something," he said, "Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou, thou shalt see greater things than this. Verily, verily, I say unto you, hereafter shall ye see the heaven open and the angels of God ascending and descending on the son of man. So if Jesus had three pools and they reacted to his three pools the same way, then how are they going to react today? Remember God doesn't change. His ministry doesn't change. Flesh flesh will pass away but the spirit doesn't. If they crucified him when he came the first time as son of man, what are they going to do again to the word when he comes the second time as son of man? &gt;&gt; They're going to crucify him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because he's Hebrews 13:8. &gt;&gt; So to come to make full circle what is the message? It's not just brother Brandham. He was the messenger, but he brought something. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Or let me get it real personal. He introduced someone. &gt;&gt; There it is. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's the message. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; What is the message? I'm looking at it. &gt;&gt; The message is not I don't have a book up here, but the message is not books and tapes. They're tools to get the word in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. You could eat the literal pages of the Bible. I wouldn't recommend it. But that would not put the word in you. &gt;&gt; That would not put the word in you. But you sit here under the anointing of the Holy Ghost and let the preaching come forth and you receive it in faith. That'll put the word for you. That'll put the word in you. That's what happened on the day of Pentecost while Peter yet spake the words. That's how they get got the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Now, we believe in Jesus name baptism. But let me say, don't stop there. &gt;&gt; That's right. Come on. &gt;&gt; Don't stop here. Brother Brandon was saying in the church age book, he said multitudes fail right there. It's the right baptism. Yes, in the name of Jesus Christ. But go on to receive the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Go on. If you've been baptized, begin to ask him for the Holy Ghost. Begin to ask him, "Lord, I need the Holy Ghost. I need the Holy Ghost. Sanctify me. Sanctify me. I need the Holy Ghost." And guess what? He promised he'll give it to you. &gt;&gt; Why? because you are obedient to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; He would, you know, as the prophet's ministry came on, he began to be more forthcoming and early on he was in the first and second pole and and he was just trying to he was using the wisdom of God because he was trying to get people in because you know God would send him to a city for one person. &gt;&gt; Do you know God would have a church service for one person? That's right. &gt;&gt; Do you know God will operate an entire camp to get to one person? That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; If he has to. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's how God does. &gt;&gt; All the resources that went into the brand meetings. And he might have only went there for one person, &gt;&gt; one rainbow trout. &gt;&gt; But he says, "My mission, I believe, to the earth is what? To forrun the coming word." See the coming word which is Christ and Christ in him has the millennium and has everything right there because he is the word. See? All right. Now, the Bible is a love letter. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you read a love letter, which now is probably a love text. I don't know. But you read it between the lines. Whenever you're really in love with somebody and they send you that and she or he sends you that really special text, you can you can you can get the vibe behind the text. &gt;&gt; And this Bible was God's love letter to us. &gt;&gt; And we read between the lines. In Genesis 18, God came down in flesh and performed this same ministry to Abraham and Sarah. And there at the end, the prophet would be so would just tell him out in the open and he would literally turn his back. He'd preach about Abraham and Sarah, then turn his back, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And begin to the Holy Ghost would begin to discern, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And what did Jesus What did Jesus tell them in St. John 8:56? He told the Pharisees, he said, "Your father Abraham rejoiceed to see my day, and he saw it and was glad." &gt;&gt; How did Abraham see his day? The same sign. That's &gt;&gt; right. Because Jesus came all them hundreds or or hundreds and hundreds of years later in flesh and did the same sign that Melzdc did for Abraham. &gt;&gt; It was the same God. &gt;&gt; But Melzdc couldn't die for our sins. He spoke the word. He stepped into that body and then he was gone. &gt;&gt; But Jesus became born of a woman, &gt;&gt; right? so he could experience what everyone experiences. &gt;&gt; He wanted a full human experience. And Jesus aged because he wanted to fill it all. So after he after he discerned the thoughts of Sarah, their body was changed. He Abraham was never in Sodom. Right. &gt;&gt; But remember, there were two messengers that went and preached to Sodom. &gt;&gt; Brother Ram would identify them as Billy Graham and Oral Roberts. &gt;&gt; Good, decent men. They were anointed of God to do what they did. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because remember, you have the pennies, the dimes, and they had their place, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But God stayed back with Abraham. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; He stayed back with his silver dollar. And he not only stayed back with him, he made he said, "Shall I hide from Abraham &gt;&gt; the things that I'm about to do?" &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; Seeing that he's become of heir. He's he's become an heir of all the earth. Shall I hide from Abraham? He hasn't hid nothing from Abraham's seed. Sodom is doing what Sodom is doing, but the bride's doing what the bride's doing. &gt;&gt; Rebecca and Isaac in Genesis 24. See, the Bible and they have stories. They're not just stories. There's a lot of things that happen in these people's lives that is not recorded in the scripture. But what is recorded in the scripture, we have to pay very close attention to. &gt;&gt; There is a reason for every story in the Bible. Even the ones you can't explain, we can't wrap our minds around. There's a reason for it. So, we find that after that Isaac, as he becomes of age, Abraham realizes that it's time that he get married. So, he's got a very faithful servant named Eleazar. And that's a picture of this end time. Abraham, a type of God. You have Isaac, a type of Jesus Christ. And Eleazar, a type of brother Brandham. Now, whenever God whenever, excuse me, whenever Abraham sent Eleazar to go get Isaac a wife, he said, "Don't go to Babylon where I came out of." He said, "You go to my kindred." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You go to my type of people. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And that's where you get Isaac. The name Eleazar, this is this was pretty fascinating to me. The name Eleazar, Eli, like in Elijah. Elijah means God is Jehovah. Jehovah, the the God is my Jehovah. And Elazar means God is my help. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Elijah is my God is Jehovah. And Eleazar means God is my help. In other words, he's helpless without him. That's right. &gt;&gt; When he would begin to to discern what he would stall and he'd start building the people's faith with the woman at the well with the story of Nathaniel, he said, "You know what I'm doing? I'm waiting on him cuz I can't do nothing without him." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, eer, the second part of Elizer means help. And it's actually the same word that's used to describe Eve whenever she was taken from Adam as a help meat for Adam. &gt;&gt; It's the same word. And the in Genesis 2:18, and the Lord God said, "It is not good that man should dwell alone. I will make and help me meet for him." It literally means a help that's corresponding to him, a help that's suitable for him. That's &gt;&gt; right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Before the fall, Eve was co-equal with Adam. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where God sends a prophet as a type of Elazar to take a bride for Isaac whose help is God to call out a bride taken from the side of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Because where was Eve taken from Adam's side? Where's the bride taken from? the side of the Lord Jesus. Remember when he was on the cross? We're joint hes with Christ. As Rebecca's coming back, where does she meet her Isaac? In the field between his house and between her house. We meet the Lord Jesus in the air between his home and where we just came from. The &gt;&gt; the these stories, brothers and sisters, are endless of the different types and shadows of the message. &gt;&gt; The whole Bible speaks of this hour. Speaks of of Jesus Christ and the bride because the whole Bible is a love story. &gt;&gt; So you have Abraham and his experiences. Then you have Isaac and his experiences. Then you have Jacob and Rachel. &gt;&gt; And we know how much he loved Rachel. How many years did he have to work for Rachel? He worked seven and he got tricked and he got Leah &gt;&gt; like the Old Testament bride and he had to work a whole another seven church I mean years amen &gt;&gt; to get Rachel right &gt;&gt; in 2 Kings 8 there was a widow woman who had to leave the land of her fathers the promised land because of famine in the land for seven years or seven church ages there was a famine at the end of the seven years she comes back and the king appoints The king appoints a certain officer to restore everything that she lost. &gt;&gt; Everything she was missing during the seven church ages &gt;&gt; gets restored back to her. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; The message is the midnight cry of Matthew 25. At midnight there was a cry made, "Behold, the bridegroom cometh. Go ye out to meet him." The message is a voice that came from heaven that said, "Come out of her, my people, and be ye not a partaker of her sins, that you receive not of her plagues." What is that? The voice of Jesus Christ. It's the voice behind the voice. &gt;&gt; In the present stage of my ministry, Brother Ran realizes that he's began to be forsaken. the doors of his ministry that the doors are getting smaller and few between as it if you'll understand the figure of speech getting less and less invitations to preach. People rejecting the gospel &gt;&gt; and he realized he takes just like he he took a sermon of I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision &gt;&gt; and he began to preach it and all them preachers got up and walked out on them. &gt;&gt; He realized he was like Paul. Paul, every messenger is going to be represented with the elect of their age. &gt;&gt; Paul is going to appear with his group. Remember when brother went past the curtain of time, right? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, he's the messenger of our church age, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; So we he's going to present us to the Lord Jesus as the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; We'll always be we'll always be associated together. &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? We'll always be associated together throughout all eternity because of our journey here on earth. We'll always be associated with the prophet because we believed his ministry. &gt;&gt; Think about when when you meet him &gt;&gt; and all that he preached all them years ago and yet you stood firm in the worst of times and you believed. How's that going to make you? You talk about some tears flowing. That is why when the resurrection happens on the earth, the prophet said that we're all going to be able to see who's there, get to hug one another, and then when we all go up, it'll be all eyes on him. &gt;&gt; Sure, we're going to see brother Brandham. Sure, the like I said, tears will be shed, but then we're all going to start looking at him. &gt;&gt; What a time that's going to be. Why? Because you cared enough about his word. He sent you a message and you believed it. &gt;&gt; He said, "I hope he will crown my ministry of this of letting me take the clothes of the word and dress his bride in the clothe of the word and and for his righteousness. I hope he will crown me. Let me stand on that day. Say, behold the lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world. the same spirit of Elijah. Now when John introduced when John the Baptist introduced Jesus, the focus then transitioned from John &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; to Jesus. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham introduces Jesus Christ to us. He'll never lose. He's a seventh star. But the emphasis, the focus and the adoration is on the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Remember John even said, "He that hath the bride is the bridegroom. But the friend of the bridegroom which standeth and heareth rejoices greatly of the bridegroom's voice. This is my joy therefore is fulfilled. He must increase, but I must decrease." &gt;&gt; That's right. You can imagine what it must have been like if you knew if you're a personal friend of brother Brandham and have him taken away so tragically so quickly without warning. How helpless and lost. And what are we going to do? There was no message churches to go to. What are we going to do? &gt;&gt; But God wanted the bride's attention to turn to what he said. &gt;&gt; That's where he wants our attention. He wants our attention to be on he because he is the message in the in the rapture and I'm getting ready to close in the rapture sermon in the rapture scripture of first Thessalonians 4 verse 13. But I would not have you be ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep that ye sorrow not even as others which have no hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep. For the Lord himself &gt;&gt; shall descend from heaven with a shout. &gt;&gt; There's your message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, it didn't say William Brandon would descend with a shout. &gt;&gt; It says that the Lord himself would descend from heaven with a shout. In Revelations 10, when he has the book open, he the mighty angel comes down. But the mighty angel descending, there's an seventh uh church age messenger, a star on the earth to receive the word. And who does it introduce? Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; See the third pull, number three can't come before one. &gt;&gt; Right? If number three, if the third pole and the opening of the word and the seventh seal was preached in 1947, that would have probably put all of our eyes out. The bright light, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But it is just a little bit of time. Catch their attention. Catch their attention. God's moving. The lame walk. The blind see. Bible days are here again. And then behind the sign, there was a voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The voice of the sign. So, if you're a part of the shout, then you're a part of the rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Think about it. The rapture, the the the body change that we're all waiting for, it's going to be it'll be in a moment, a twinkling of an eye that Paul talked about. But the actual rapture is a process. &gt;&gt; And it's in motion. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And it has been for decades. So, if you're in the shout, Brother Chester, then you're also in the voice and the trump. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, how do we get into the shout? By attending FGLT or by attending Evening Light or a No, you get into him by one spirit. That's how you get into the shout. And once you're in the shout, you got the token, baby, you in. You going &gt;&gt; cuz you have your token in your hand. &gt;&gt; And how, like the prophet said, if you have the token, how can somebody make me get off the bus? &gt;&gt; Come on. You don't just have like like like like a ticket like you when you go to Disney World. Sorry, Sister Whitney, but you just go to Disney World and you don't really have a spot. You got to try and find yourself a spot because there's only No, you've got a reservation &gt;&gt; and nobody can take your spot. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If you're in the message, think about the words. Not are you in the message? That changes because the message has got to be in you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And I and my father, the father in me. So if you're a part of the shout, then you're a part of the entire rapture. Where would we be as individuals, our lives? If it wasn't for this message, &gt;&gt; I don't I I can't even begin to think it's everything to us. It's not a doctrine. It's not a bunch of commandments. It's not legalism. is grace. &gt;&gt; Some people may look to see legalism to see rules and wish they could do something. But if their heart were changed and they would line themselves up with the word, they see jubilee. They see freedom. &gt;&gt; Jubilee. The headstone. &gt;&gt; Remember in the scriptures in Zechariah when the headstone, a type of this age came, what was it crying out? Grace. Grace. But in the book of Revelation, the angels, the judgment angels, whoo, whoo, woe to the inhabitants of the earth. &gt;&gt; But to the bride, grace, grace, grace &gt;&gt; to the world, it's the great tribulation is before them. Think we're so excited. We're on the cusp of the body change and we just can't wait. And we're so excited and the world is on the cusp of the great tribulation period, &gt;&gt; right? and have no idea. &gt;&gt; Remember the scripture said whenever they say peace and safety, that's when sudden destruction is going to come on them. Brother Ram said in the sermon, who do you say this is? He says that's the way the message is. You can sympathize with it and say it's right, but you've got to take it yourself to become a part of it. &gt;&gt; Then you and the message become one. Then the anointing is with you as it was with the others. Now the Holy Ghost and the new birth is the same thing. The new birth is Jesus Christ personally revealed to you. &gt;&gt; You know for yourself that Jesus Christ rose from the dead because he revealed he literally you met him. Just like the evidence of the Holy Ghost is hearing the word for your day. It's personally revealed to you. There has to come a point, young people, where it's not it's right because mommy and daddy says it's right. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; It's right because you know it's right. &gt;&gt; Then no matter we pray, we all go together. But if something were to happen to mommy and daddy, I'm still believing this message. &gt;&gt; That's when you've got something real. Because remember the admonition to every church age is he that has an ear to hear what the spirit says unto the church let him hear. Luke 17:30 isn't just about manifesting Jesus Christ just in the prophet. The extension of that is in the bride continuing the same works the same ministry. She is him. Let's stand. Musicians can come in the sermon trying to do a service without it being God's will. Brother Ram says, "How many of you ever seen that picture of a cow in a bush that you just have to look and look?" Did you ever see that? Or seen the picture of Christ in a bush or in the sky or the clouds? See, that painter has got it so fixed up to you have to look at it just a certain way. Well, then when you once see it, you can't see nothing else but that. &gt;&gt; Every time you look, there it is. How many seen those pictures? Well, sure you have. He said, "That's the way it is." That well, that's the way Christ is himself, the gospel. The message is when you once see the message of the hour, there's nothing else you can see &gt;&gt; but that. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; That's all. Everything else is gone. The rest is just a filler. See, when you once see the message, &gt;&gt; I pray that something was said tonight that you can take and and grab a hold of, maybe help your understanding some. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God has done something very special for us in this hour. &gt;&gt; And let me just also say this in closing. You might have never spoke in tongues or danced in the spirit in your life. Amen. &gt;&gt; You might have never seen the pillar of fire. You might have never had a spiritual dream. You might have never seen a vision. You might have never seen the lame walk or the blind see. But the greatest thing, the greatest thing that God can ever do for you is to give you an ear to hear &gt;&gt; what the spirit is saying in this day. &gt;&gt; Because there's multitudes of people all across this world in churches that do all them things but would reject this truth. That is the most powerful and most amazing thing that God could ever do for you. &gt;&gt; If you could play something softly, please. So, what is the message of the hour? The message of the hour is Jesus Christ. If you could speak to Noah and you say, "Noah, what is the message of the hour?" He said, "Get on the ark because it's going to rain." &gt;&gt; Abraham, what is the message of the hour? &gt;&gt; Oh, it's Melzdc. He took on flesh and I met him. He brought me out of Babylon. He came in flesh to vindicate the coming of the promised son. Moses, what is the message of the hour? &gt;&gt; Apply the token because the death angel's in the land and we're leaving in the morning. &gt;&gt; Come on. Joshua, what is the message of the hour? &gt;&gt; Get ready. For within three days you shall pass over this Jordan &gt;&gt; to go in to possess the land which the Lord your God giveth you. Mary, what is the message of the hour? &gt;&gt; The baby that I received by the spoken word of an angel is the Messiah. that he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David. John the Baptist, what is the message of the hour? Behold the lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world. Omega bride, what is the message of the hour? Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Let me quote the words of John for you. After he recognized Jesus after the resurrection, they were all so bummed out and they go fishing. They're trying to keep busy and they didn't see it coming. They didn't understand. Jesus kept telling them, "I'm about to go up to Jerusalem. I'm gonna be killed. I'm gonna be I'm gonna let myself get in the hands of sinful men." And they go and they're so discouraged, Brother Matt. And they're just fishing. And after that third day, they're fishing and they see a man on the shore and he calls out and he says, "Children, have you have you any meat? Have you caught anything?" Said, "No." He didn't know who it was. Said, "No, we've told all night. We haven't caught nothing." And this strange man from the shore said, "Cast on the other side." &gt;&gt; Well, didn't think of that. Let me try it. Amen. &gt;&gt; And whenever they cast on the other side, there was so many fish in their net. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; John said, "It is the Lord." [Music] &gt;&gt; They recognized the works that he did before his crucifixion is the same works he's doing now. &gt;&gt; That's you. &gt;&gt; God has blessed you. And see, God could have called you, Brother Ray, in any church age he wanted. He could have called you and anointed you to give your life at the stake. He could have called you and anointed you, literally an anointing to take your family and go into the coliseum. You would have still been elect. You would have still been in the bride. You' still be in heaven. You'd be enjoying the presence of God. But he saved you as an end time people. He saved you as an end time people because he pressurized you for the age. Young people, there's a lot of pressure &gt;&gt; for the the the boy. The young boys had their pressures. The young girls had their pressures. Pressures everywhere. The middle age had their pressures. The elderly had their pressures. Pressure. Pressure. But I've got good news for you. You're pressurized to fly higher. &gt;&gt; You're pressurized to believe this message [Music] &gt;&gt; when it just blows the feathers out of some. They're not eagles, but yet God has called you to believe a message, the greatest message to hit the earth since the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; May we praise him for that. May we always honor him for that and be thankful for that. &gt;&gt; We believe God sent a prophet with all of our heart. But brothers and sisters, we've got to realize and we've got to meet who he introduced. [Music] If you don't know him, if you haven't met, may you not stop day and night till you meet him. That's right. &gt;&gt; Ask the Lord for the Holy Ghost. If you have the Holy Ghost, ask him for more. If you if you know, ask God, ask God for more revelation. &gt;&gt; What did the prophet say? There's nothing of such prevailing power as revelation. Revelation. It's It's Satan that will make revelation spooky to you. &gt;&gt; It's Satan that will take re Oh, that that's so revelated. It's not. The gospel is simple. The message is simple. If your understanding isn't to a certain place, as I said before, thank God for what you have, but it's there for you. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Walk in it. Love God with all your heart. Prepare your heart for his coming. &gt;&gt; He loves you. I know we hear that all the time. But he loves you so much. He sent you this message. &gt;&gt; That's right. Come on. &gt;&gt; He didn't just save you. You're his bride. &gt;&gt; And he sent you the most beautiful, glorious, powerful message to get you ready. And you're going to rule and reign with him, brother Nathan, as his queen, as as as a help meat for him, as the bride of Jesus Christ. Are we worthy? No. But God made you a silver dollar. Except that he made you a silver dollar. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Amen. As the deer panth for the water, so my soul longeth that after thee. You alone are my heart's desire and I long to worship thee. You alone are my strength, my shield. To you alone may my spirit yield. [Music] You alone are my heart desire and I long to worship you. [Music] You're my friend and you are my brother even though you are the king [Music] and I love you more than the other so much more than anything. [Music] You alone are my strength, my shield. To you alone may my spirit yield. You alone are my heart desire and I long to worship you. [Music] Oh, you alone are my strength, my shield. To you alone may my spirit give. You alone are my heart's desire and I long to worship you. Amen. Hallelujah. Aren't we thankful for this message? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Like brother William said, where where would we be if not for this message? This message had the power to take a sinner and and just turn his life from one thing &gt;&gt; and make him another, a son of God. &gt;&gt; I didn't have the power to save myself. I didn't have the power to save my son. But if you want to know the power of this message, there's an example. &gt;&gt; I took him at his word. &gt;&gt; I love him. Hallelujah. How great is our God, the splendor of a king, clothed in majesty. Let all the earth rejoice. All the earth rejoice. He wraps himself in life and darkness tries to hide and trembles at his voice. Trembles at his voice. How great is our God. Oh, sing with me. How great is our God and all. How great is our God. Age to age he stands and time is in his hand. Beginning at the end, beginning at the end. God in three in one. [Music] Father, spirit and son, the lion and the lamb. Lion and the lamb. How great is our God. Oh, sing with me.
