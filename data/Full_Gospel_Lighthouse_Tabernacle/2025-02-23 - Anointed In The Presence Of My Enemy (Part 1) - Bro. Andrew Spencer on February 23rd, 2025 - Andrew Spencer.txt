atmosphere in this place describes that this is the house of God and Father we have come this morning Lord Jesus for you to come and touch Our Lives in a very special way now God we have humbled ourselves Lord before the Living God lord as the prophet Isaiah would say God would you take one of the coals from the fire lay it upon my tongue for I'm a man of unclean lips and I live amongst people of unclean people and I'd say Here I Am send me Father Here we are this morning your children reporting reporting for Duty father and Lord we're in your presence Lord and we ask God that you would come amongst us in a very special way we dedicate this service to your hands in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you today it's wonderful to be in the house of the Lord isn't it amen I want to personally just want to say thank you for each and every one of your prayers for me the past week or so and uh I know many of of you didn't know exactly what was going on and I personally didn't know exactly what was going on either and went back forth to the doctor and and U they they basically just said something like like cold lius and it's basically like somebody had a knife in my in my side for about a week and a half now and and uh it's been been a battle and uh you know I I had I had doctors um guessing at what it was I had family members guessing at it what it was the difference was is one was a guest and one was an educated guest somebody paid more for their guest than this one but I I'm really thankful for the Lord touching my body I I can tell you it's you you you get sick like that or get pain like that you appreciate the good times and uh I I certainly am appreciative I I've had I just had so many writing and and praying for me and I just I really want to thank you all and uh and uh you know I I I told the brothers uh there's a few Brothers right me said you going to preach this weekend I said buddy let me tell you if I don't I said my people's going to call me a wimp seeing what my dad goes through every week and and uh so I didn't want to be called a wimp so but but I'm thankful to be feeling good and uh we're just going to test the waters out here this morning and uh just uh let the body Let the Body uh be healed by the anointing of the Lord and we certainly love each and every one of you and um I just want to make mention I got a I got a picture last weekend after we got out of service from brother Ron vest and his family the picture was his family and his entire family there and some other brothers and sisters there and his in his home there and they had took a picture of them worshiping while we were worshiping service while they were streaming and I it just really touched me that um how how how great the body of Christ is that she she's no matter what the mileage is no matter what the distance she's willing to feed on the unfailing body word of the son of man and uh we just certainly love the bride of Christ and and uh we just appreciate you so much amen if you have your Bibles today we'd like to look over in the scriptures in Psalms chapter 23 and just pick up a little bit of inspiration here that the Lord has has dealt with us on and uh you know maybe sometimes he sends you through something so that you can look at something in a in a way and uh I was just I I was going back through 1955 this uh past two weeks and was listening through the message there and and brother random deals very heavily on some things there in in 1955 but he preaches a sermon on beginning and the ending of the Gentile dispensation and it's it's a beautiful text if you haven't listened to it for a while I I would encourage you to do so on I I'd like to draw our text from there today and also from Psalms 23 here David saying this the Lord is my shepherd and I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadth me beside the Still Waters he restoreth my soul he leadth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake and yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies thou anointest my head with oil and my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever also Luke 4 and verse one then I'll also read one scripture from Revelations CH 3 and verse 20 just to draw our text today Luke 4 and verse1 says and Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan and was led by the spirit Into the Wilderness the key importance here Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost you remember exactly where we're just coming from in this Tex text is that he has just come out of the banks of the Jordan River and you begin to see the witness of the holy spirit that there Jesus is adopted that we see that the that the voice from Heaven says hear ye him and Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan and was led by the spirit in the wilderness being 40 days tempted of the devil and in those days he did not eat in nothing and when they were ended he afterward hungered and the devil said unto him if thou be the Son of God command this this stone that it be made bread and Jesus answered and saying it is written that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word of God also Revelations 3 and: 20 behold I stand at the door and knock and if any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will s with him and this is my favorite and he with me may God bless his word he may be seated SE in the presence of the Lord I would like to take a text today and title this on anointed in the presence of the enemy anointed in the presence of the enemy and I my subject matter will be uh quite heavily on a table prepared brother brandham makes this statement in the beginning in the enti G dispensation he said before you can have a victory there has got to be a battle and if there is no battles there is no victory iies so we ought to be thankful for the battles and the trying it's God giving us the opportunity to have victories we ought to be thankful for the battles and the trying it's God giving us the opportunity to have victories you know as soon as you start out for Christ no matter how old you are in your Christian walk but immediately you begin to think it's just it's just how a child thinks that you're you're not going to have to face opposition but it's absolutely the contrary you'll find that in this Christian Life it is one that is filled with constant attacks and disappointments and attacks from the enemy on this side and on that side you have battles within and you have battles without but I would say this no matter how many battles that you go through or I've been through I would choose this Christian walk a thousand times and doesn't matter what I've been through doesn't matter what I've seen or what what has gone by I would choose this life a th times because I realize what he saved me from now brother random would I would like to just draw this from here no wonder David said the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want and how he leads us by the side of still waters and restores their soul and runs our cups over and anoints us in the presence of the enemy he said did you ever get anointed in the presence of your enemy he said just to testify till your cup just bow over over you know just how marvelous it is to be anointed when in the presence of your enemy and I I would like to just ask the question have you ever been anointed in the presence of your enemy just to be able to testify that that you are you are in a place that your cup is running over that I think is very very beautiful that you can testify in the face of critics and you can testify in the face of your enemies even when you are in the midst of your trials that you can realize that you are anointed by by more than just a just by a a feeling but you are anointed by a power in the presence of your enemies now David would say in Psalms chapter 2 and verse one why do the Heathen rage and the people imagine a vain thing the kings of the earth set themselves and the rulers take counsel together against the Lord and against his anointed saying let us break their bands aunder and Cast Away their cords from us you notice that these these Kings and these these ones they have come together they are literally sitting down together and taking counsel against the Lord and against his anointing he said let us break their bands asunder and Cast Away their cords from us also in Psalms 20 and6 he said now I know that the Lord saveth his anointing that he will hear him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand so I I would like to just paint this picture to you today that the children of God are made to Triumph in the very presence of their enemies that the enemy has been called to this place to be able to watch you to watch you go through this but to watch God take care of you I want you to realize that the enemy that the reason why the enemy is is here is to watch you in I want you to realize that the reason why the enemy has even showed up is so that God can show that he's defending you I want you to realize that the reason why the enemy has even got a chance to be in the building today is so that God can show that he's willing to provide for you so just because you see the presence of enemies it does not mean that you are defeated it literally means that God is in control brother manam would take this text on on that day at Calvary he said he said now you can be honest just an upright he said but Satan can do nothing about it because you got a hold of a Lifeline he said it's anchored in the Rock of Ages he said nothing can shake you from it no winds can shake you from it no nothing not even death itself can separate us from the love of God that's in Christ Jesus he said that's what Calvary meant men that were in bondage were set free I would like somebody to say Satan was wrong say it to your neighbor Satan is wrong Satan is wrong and one of the greatest things about you is when you are going through your B battle and when you are going through your maybe your toughest of Trials if you can keep your focus and if you can keep your peace it is the most misunderstood proof of power that that is seen is when you are in the midst of it and in the midst of criticism or in the midst of a trial is that you can remain calm and collected and remain in peace and in focus and realizing that there's nothing that the enemy can do to you because the scripture said that no weapon that is formed against you shall Pro Prosper you see the enemy that has literally come against you was destined by almighty God so that God could set you down at the table it reminds me about that story brother Brandon will talk about that antelope that was trying to get away from the hounds how that he was running with everything he was panting with everything that was within him and the hounds were right on him but all of a sudden there was a fence that got out in front of the analou and the antalope jumped over top of the fence and the hounds couldn't do nothing to it because the electrical shock that was on that fence and that an brother random said that analou just turned around and snorted at him and took off with with peace in his life because he knew the hounds couldn't get past that fence well you and I are kind of like job this morning is that God's got a hedge about us that the devil can't do nothing to us because God has got a blood cell of Jesus Christ that was broke 2,000 years ago and the reason why the enemy has even showed up in this life in your life is so that you could be predestined or that that you could be crafted in such a space that'll show your predestination now brother brandom comes in in at the end of 1962 and you you realize as message studiers that you realize that brother bram's Ministry it has changed it is moving into the into the operation of the opening of the word and you're you're seeing the the third Po in manifestation and you begin to watch these things and if you go and look at the the last four service that brother brandham takes in in 1962 he preaches on the reproach for the cause of the word the absolute and is this a sign of the insurers and then he preaches a a the sermon at the at the end of the year or at the new year he preaches the contest and brother random you you'll see there that brother random starts he he's just now he's just now had the vision of of the Seven Angels coming to him and you here you go into is this a sign of the insur that Brother randam start coming there and he starts laying these things out and he starts he starts talking about all the hidden mysteries that that were to be revealed by the ministry of Malachi 4 and he starts looking at this and he realizes that he realizes that that that this in this Vision that if it's if it's his end if it's his end that that that it's just right around the corner but there the anointing of the Lord would sweep into the room and would tell him that it's not his end but it was literally the next phase of his ministry that was coming into view and brother brandom I I went through these I went through these tapes this past week on the reproach for the cause of Christ and brother brandom picks that up in Psalms 89 and verse 51 he said wherewith thine enemies have reproached oh Lord wherewith have they reproached the footsteps of thine anointing blessed be the Lord forever more amen and amen and brother mam goes in there and he starts laying in there about about the Christian walk about about the reproach of Christ and how that how that this Christian walk has has been reproached by the scoffers and the mockers and the critics of this world and I was listening I was listening back to it yesterday and I heard something I heard something quite profound and brother Ram was talking about Mary how that she met the angel and how she come in contact with the angel and the angel had told her to stop there and that that she was going to be overshadowed with the Holy Ghost and that the very child that was going to be in her would be a child of the Holy Ghost and brother Rams would say that he said now there was a lot of people that was critics and there was mockers about saying that that this was Joseph's child or this was A Soldier's child and I this is what I found so so incredible is that brother random said that but Mary knew Mary knew whose child that was you see the Bride of Jesus Christ knows whose seed that she is carrying because she knows the mate that she's been with any woman knows who seed that she's carrying this is not a this is not an affair she didn't pick this seat up out there on the street somewhere but literally she knows that she's been in contact with a husband she's been in contact and she knows what she carried this bride ain't carrying serpent seed this bride is carrying a spoken word genan seed of almighty God that has anointed this L the lady in this generation you look at it even thus shall it be in the days when the son of man is being revealed that you are carrying around a seed that is greater than Mary come on this seed that Mary was C carrying was greater than herself do you realize that you are here to show forth and magnify Jesus Christ the seed on the inside of you is greater than your flesh so the seed is not going to let your flesh get in your way the seed is not going to let your sickness get in the way Hallelujah brother Brandon would say this and the anointed ones at the end time he said three things lay before you right now I wish I'd sent this upstairs so that you could read it along with me but you can find it he said three things lay before you right now first the world is in a Sodom condition Jesus said it would happen look at the perversion our women trying to act like men our men trying to act like women cified rotten filthy low down devil possessed and don't know it the Bible said that would happen and that's where it's at secondly in that hour according to the scriptures that Janice and jambus appear he said that's secondly he said thirdly that it's in that same hour that the son of man is to be re revealed so you look at the the you look at the thermometer of where we were you see that Abraham is up there he's having a conference with one and you look at lot where he's at and you could see the perversion of of Sodom and Gomorrah you could see the you can see the impersonations of Janice and jambre he said but it's in that same hour that the son of man is going to be revealed now he says now there is your believer he said there is your believer your make believer and your unbeliever and I absolutely love this quote because you notice watch this how brother brandom interchanges the word believer to genuine Vindication he said there is your genuine word standing out Vindicated he said there's your make believer imperson impersonating it and there's your unbeliever rejecting the whole thing you realize that is exactly who you are you're more than just identified as a Believer but you are the Vindicated word of this hour made manifest that right here you see those three things that are fully manifested before you you see Sodom Rising on every every condition you try to protect your children as much as you can from it but it's right there in their face you see the impersonation of Christianity and it ain't them people it's a spirit that's on them that's trying to impersonate it but right here in the midst of it in the midst of all of it there's a people that is Anointed and to be V the Vindicated word of the hour made manifest you see Jesus said that man is not going to it's not it's not going to live by bread alone but he's literally got to live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God now in the seven Church ages brother Bram said now God's intention for his creation he said managed to express his word in Genesis Adam was given the word to live by a life lived by the word would be the word express he said that is true is it not but did Adam live by that word no because he was to live by every word and he failed to take heed of every word and if you and I are going to if we are intent on over coming Le oosa and Satan's Eden then we've got to live by the word of God come on somebody it ain't just good to talk about it ain't just to have good to have around you got to live by it I I I can tell you this I I think I think my wife's one of the best cooks in in the world and I I I have no problem picking out when we go to a potluck which is hers and which is not I I've done ate her food quite quite a long time now and I really enjoy it but you know my wife is pretty she's she's a pretty good bread maker and she you know and she she got on that Trend you know of making that sour dough and and I I tell you what I'm reaping the benefits of it but you know my my wife went through the struggles of of of figuring out the the recipe and figuring out all the criteria that it takes and all the things of it it honestly it kind of uh it overwhelmed her at first thing I'll never get this then I'd say we'd probably done ate a th000 loaves by now by the time we done figured all them bread we we done ate up you know and and she I've sat there and I enjoy watching I ain't never helped her do it and I uh just I just watch her do it cuz I figure if I mess it up I I'm going to be the guilty part he got to eat that thing and so I I've watched her sit there and I've went to the grocery store for and I've picked up the flour and I I've picked up the ingredients for her and I've watched her make it and I put it all I put it out there and I I've helped her get it together but I ain't never made it one time but I tell you what she's really good at it she can she can I tell you what sisters I know maybe you probably got the best sough recipe but I I at my house for me in my house we choose Katie Spencer's sough bread you know I I sat there and I you know I ain't never put it together I ain't never read the recipe probably it probably scared me to death try to do it but you know if if I would sit there and maybe she could take some time and maybe she could teach me how to do it I might be able to do it I might be able to learn it just a little bit but you see just having all the ingredients doesn't put it to together just having all the ingredients doesn't make you live by it but literally where the life is is when all them ingredients that I that I enjoyed going picking up and when I went out there and I enjoyed picking up the flower and then I watched her put it together the life is it is when it's put together there's a lot of people that talk about the message there's a lot of people that that look at the message but the power of it is not even putting it together the power is eating it this this lamb this bread died for you but the power is eating it you can look at the recipe you can have the finest recipe on how to overcome Satan's eating but if you don't eat it if you don't put it together if you don't feed on it it ain't doing you nothing good but just having it in your home but if you start eating on it you've been given the greatest ingredients of the hour to overcome Satan's eating we as a body of Jesus Christ have received a message to give life man shall I live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out this message came right from the Throne of almighty God I am the bread of life the Bible said in Romans 9:33 you're very familiar with it as it is written behold I lay in Zion every time you see Zion in the Bible it is it is is a symbol of the Bride of Jesus Christ behold I lay in Zion's tumbling stone and a rock of offence that whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed what is this to us this is an announcement this is the scripture that the when the angels of the Lord came to him came to William brandham and dealt with him about the seals he said my Bible was open to Romans chapter 9 and verse 33 he said it was open to that scripture you see what was it it was a declaration that this message is causing a separation between the false and the True Believers you see a Believer is always going to be met with opposition they're always going to be B battling for truth but in the midst of the reproach there is an absolute and it might look like the end and we're in the middle of a contest but there is a bride that is unmovable unshake able and she is Anointed to stand Hallelujah yeah you're going to be in a contest yeah you're going to have to battle for this truth every one of you are going to have to battle I'll tell you this believing this message is not the easiest thing you can do in life but it is the greatest your family will turn against you your friends will turn against you but I say this unto you it's life it's an anointing it's it's a power it's worth the struggle it's worth the battle it's worth it h and I believe that this message will change our bodies ah brother Andrew I say you're anointed to believe it say I'm anointed to believe it I'm anointed to believe it there's an open door and I'm stepping into it I'm anointed to believe it I'm anointed to accept it I'm anointed to eat it I'm anointed to prophesy I'm anointed to stand against the enemy I'm anointed to defeat Satan I'm anointed to overcome I'm anointed in the presence of my enemies I have been anointed by receiving a prophet's message and I'm anointed for a body change I'm anointed I'm anointed brother brand comes T night 1961 re preaches a very powerful message on the Messiah brother random lays in there believe it's 16 times that he lays in there on the word Messiah brother random starts laying it in there and he starts talking about the the prophets of old and the the sages of old how that they were Messiahs he said but they were Anointed with the same spirit that was on Jesus he said but they only had it they only had it in a partial sense he said but when Jesus came when Jesus came he was the fullness thereof he was the very life of Elohim in human flesh and brother manam turns it he said now no longer no longer are you just a people but you are Messiah that you are anointed with the same spirit that was on Jesus of Nazareth that same Spirit has come back around to you he said no wonder that Elijah could go up there to that dead boy's room and lay his body on that dead boy and he could come back to life again because it wasn't Elijah's life it was the Life of Christ that had lay down on a dead body and I say this you can lay your dead sins you can lay your dead self over top of this message and if you are elected you'll come to life you might feel like you're unworthy to get here you might feel like you don't measure up to everybody else but let me say this you're predestinated to sit at the table I spoken to an individual just just the other day about taking away the measuring tape you might never measure up to what you think brother Homer was or or brother brother Ron is or brother brandom take the measure and tape away because the way I look at it is election is election it does doesn't matter Come On Son it doesn't matter whether you ever see a vision whether you ever prophesy I say election is election I said predestination is predestination the only measuring tape that you ought to have in your hand is what side of the table that you're sitting on it matters what T what side of the table that you're sitting on I know what side I'm sitting on because I got an enemy in front of me that's screaming at me so the only only measureing tape that the Bride of Jesus Christ needs is what side of the table are you sitting on brother Andrew I don't like I don't like rejection I don't like obstacles I don't like opposition I don't like trouble if you're going to be a Christian you better get used to it come on somebody if you're going to live a Christian Life you better get used to the devil tormenting you and try to kill you and try to destroy you come on some he don't want to just make you sick he wants to kill you that Devil's after your family that Devil's after your spirit that Devil's after your job that Devil's after everything that you touch why because you're blessed and he's trying his best to curse what you touch but before I touched it almighty God put me in [Applause] it Elijah done went through some powerful things he done went through some battles but when it come to a showdown between Bale and almighty God there he was Jezebel had done turn Israel she done turn Israel to worshiping false gods she had literally turned their heart you think worship doesn't turn you Jezebel's worship turned Israel's heart now no matter what Israel got themselves into they were always God's I tell you what if you want to find some powerful things go look through the Old Testament you talk about you talk about when when God put Israel to the side how she went a whing and all those things and how that she completely went away and God put it away and God put her down there in Babylon God let all these things happen but never did God change his mind about Israel she was always his in the midst of Babylon there was a Daniel in the midst of Jezebel There Was Elijah but Elijah wasn't alone there was 7,000 down there that had not bowed the need of bail I say this to you Church of you're not alone in this battle there's more Believers in this in just what you see in this church come on put your shoulder to the wheel let's live this message Jezebel had turned their hearts to believing there's power in believing they had turned back to beli in a false god how many times did they have flipflop back and forth on what side they were on but it come time for a showdown I want you to I want you to Vision this mountain Elijah's climbing this mountain to be honest the odds are stacked up against Elijah it ain't rained it ain't rained in three years and here they are he's putting himself up at now the first one that can get fire to fall I'll be honest you strike two rocks together in that sense I tell you what you can have a fire you know good and well how it gets in the summertime around here you're scared to death to well some people ain't you're scared to death to set a fire you're afraid you like the whole Woods on fire and be obligated to something you didn't even mean to do here they were they was up there beating on rocks and screaming and hes just down there laughing at him go ahead scream a little louder shout a little my should throw some rocks in the air just laughing at them they couldn't do nothing about it why because the altar wasn't fixed the altar wasn't restored they needed Jehovah Rafa to come through Elijah and to heal the broken heart to heal the altar to put it back in order that's why the ministry of Malachi 4 had to come is because you are able to defeat Satan it's because your heart has been turned the altar has been turned back to believing now when you look at in Psalms chapter 23 Bible said thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies now anointest my head with oil my cup run over you look that word prepare in the Hebrew it means to arange it means to put to lay in order to set in Array to prepare it means to order it means to ordain it means to handle furnish esteem equal direct compare the word table comes from a direct word of the king's table this word is used in in Leviticus when when Moses says setting up the levitical priesthood in verse 7 and the sons of Aaron and the priest ver chapter one and the priest shall put fire upon on the Altar and lay the wood in order it shall prepare the wood in order upon the fire and the priest and Aaron son shall lay the parts of the head and the fat in order in order upon the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar first Samuel and 17 and 21 for Israel and the Philistines have put the battle in Array it means to prepare it means to ordain kind of like the woman when she saw Jesus sitting at a table and she saw him sitting over there in a corner and nobody would worship Him and nobody would nobody would take care of him but brother random said that she was ordained to do it she was ordained to go in there brother random said that there's something about Jesus is when he if you ever catch the G glimpse of him and if there's ever something on the inside of you he said there's something that'll come to life no matter what others may not pay no attention to it but if you are ordained to lie you'll catch the first view of it and there's something different this woman when Simon was making a mockery out of Jesus this woman came to the table where Jesus was and made him feel welcome you may not been welcomed in the room by somebody else but the master is waiting on you to come to his table and to wash his feet there might be other others that refuse to wash him there might be others that refuse to acknowledge how great he is but you are ordained to come to the table you ordained to it and you notice now when you go to studying out ancient history and over in the East that when when somebody one of the most the greatest Honors that ancient east can can bestow upon a person is when you have them come set at your table I'll just be honest when you sit with somebody in still from the Eastern countries it is one of the greatest honors for them to come and sit down at your table because at your table is where there is peace at your table that is where you are fed at your table that is where there is family conversations and that there at that table it is the greatest it is the greatest of heart Harmony that transpires around that table but also it is also known that when a host begins to invite someone to their table it also means absolute protection that when you are invited to this person's table that no matter who you are it doesn't matter if you are a foreign mercenary if you are invited to the king's table no matter the enemy enemy that has that has said that he was going to destroy you the enemy cannot come to you at that table because he would not dare to attack a guest under that host care so God will literally Place Us in situations that we literally have to have to trust him despite of the opposition that is sitting out there you might have opposition outside that is waiting on you but as long long as you are at this table you are under the host care I say it matters who's your host I say it matters who's your host it matters who sets the table the anointing in this hour is sent here to combat the very powers of hell but it's also meant to take you to a power who invited you here who invited you to this table what has anointed you to come to this table what has brought you to this place I want to say it again the anointing that has been dispersed in this generation is here to uh combat the powers of hell but it is also here to put you in power you see just like David was anointed to be king it wasn't just so that he could be anointed to be king he was anointed to be placed in power come on somebody he wasn't just anointed to kill D Goliath it was more of the David's story than just killing Goliath there's more to your story than just killing the old man there's more David was anointed for battle David was anointed for worship David was anointed for influence he draw men from all walks of life to him and David was anointed to restore you're anointed more than just to sit on the other side and look at the enemy you're anointed for power you're anointed you're anointed to win the battle you're anointed for a purpose you're anointed to possess you're anointed and the reason why Satan cannot take your life before God allows him is because of who you are you are a genan SE of almighty God somebody say I am The Offspring of God I am a child of God I am a gene of almighty God I am predestinated I am ordained I am anointed it's more than just saying it Church the message proves that your anointing is here the message proves what's been spoken in this generation is the truth it's life it's power David wasn't just anointed to be king yeah that was great but he was anointed to restore he was anointed to influence and you have been anointed let me say this church you have been anointed to take everything that the enemy has stolen away from you you remember what the Bible said in Genesis chapter 22 when Abraham found out that he was Jehovah Gyra he said thy seed shall possess the Gate of its enemies and thy seed thy seed what is on the inside of you it's a royal seed William brandham said in possessing the enemy's gates in the Church of the Living God lays the power to heal all sickness in the Church of the Living God lays the power to heal all sickness he ain't saying it's up there in heaven he ain't saying it's back there at the cross but in the Church of the Living God lays the power what is that power it's an anointing that comes from Calvary in the Church of the Living God lays power to overcome all temptation in the possession of the Church of the Living God this morning lays the power to change sin and throw it away get rid of it get rid of it the thing that keeps making you disbelieve this message get rid of it I say if it's your friends young people get rid of it this let in this power lays the power to change your sin and throw it away you know how easy it is take a trash out come on somebody why don't you carry some trash out why don't you carry that doubt out and throw it in a bin why don't you carry that fear out and throw it in a bin why don't you carry out that complex and throw it in a bin come on take that fear out take it out take it out that fear ain't got nothing new with you that comes straight from the pits of Hell let me have it that ain't my sin but I want to take that back it was just illustration God have mercy you know what brother I'll tell you what I thank God for this message it's simple but here I am brother mam said in the Easter seal he said Easter ruined all their theology because they had said all kinds of things about this man but this man was anointed not just to heal the sick he was not just anointed to preach the gospel he was anointed like no other man's been anointed to raise up from the grave he said you could take try to take my life from it but on the third day I'll raise it up again let me say this to you it ruined their theology because they tried to lock him in there they tried to seal him in there they tried to create lies but the reason why they theology is ruined is because you're here hallelujah that se that resurrection power that came down from heaven is in you brother Mar would say it in the restoration of the Bride tree he said now he said the vine has got to put forth a branch and when it comes forth it's going to Bear the same thing that the vine did so it's going to carry and bear the very power that the vine had is that right so it's Easter again in the believer's hearts it's Resurrection again he's got people everywhere that it's Easter for them I love this he said it's Easter again the Royal seed has been hid in The Roots the word headd back there in this word for years and years and years and just now to begin to reveal he said it's predestinated from the foundation of the world this church begins to stand stand again in the anointed ones he said the True Vine and the false Vine have the same anointing he went on to say they look the same they're anointed the same but by their fruit you know them he said the church that believes in Jesus Christ will do the works of Jesus Christ it'll have the life of Jesus Christ and if it isn't no matter if the life is pouring into it if it isn't predestinated from The Roots it'll bear something different but if it's predestinated life in the roots it'll bear Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever if it's a word coming up through the root which he is a root and the beginning of it that when Satan come in in the form of them bugs he couldn't get to you you remember when brother brand goes up there in Canada and he's going through there and he's driving through and that there's that big burnover he said it was real spooky reminds me of a lot of these dead cold churches he said when the wind would hit them he said they would move back and forth oo he's a real spooky he said then I got to Noti and that he said I kept hearing this little sound maybe it was Full Gospel Lighthouse he was hearing maybe it was even in L Tabernacle he was hearing maybe maybe it was the Church of Christ maybe it was over there over there with George Quinn and the Believers there in Ireland or maybe maybe it was with the brothers and sisters over there in Belgium or maybe it was over there with the brothers and sisters from Tanzania maybe he be to see something and he said I hear that sound and he said I wondered what that was he said in the midst of all that big burnover when those people that had refused to worship God he said down there there was some undergrowth that the fire couldn't get to that the fire couldn't stop and when the wind hit it he said it just rustled back and forth there's a lot of people that don't understand your worship there's a lot of people that don't understand the way that you get up and praise God at the preaching of the word it's because the wind the wind makes you move let me say this the fires of Hell cannot stop you if the root has been predestinated from almighty God there is nothing I say this to you you are predestinated to believe Against All Odds brother brandham said in the Feast of the trumpets that to believe is the evidence of the Holy Spirit I know there's a lot of Baptists around the message that I appreciate you saying that brother Andrew I'm going to say this that believing is not just walking there's a lot of Baptist that enjoy a good easy believism that just confess it and walk out and do their own sin and enjoy their own life but let me say that let me read the quote on a little bit further he said now you can't pronounce that just going to church is the evidence of the Holy Ghost if you do then the Pharisees had it you can't pronounce it shaking or jumping he said if you do the heathens has got you you can't say that speaking in tongues he said why because the Devils worship and they speak in tongues don't they but believing is the evidence of the Holy Spirit what is it it's not just confessing but believing is an action word it's an action word that's why James 2:7 said even so faith if it hath not works is dead and being alone faith is action it ain't just talking about it I happen to believe that William Brandon wasn't just talking about squirrels I believe it happened I believe it something rolled as he said a super anointing come sweeping down through Sportsman holla and it came through there and it produced exactly what I was looking for so what am I saying that true true belief produces action there's a lot of people that's when their Church there's a lot of people that's read their Bible there's a lot of people that are good people but if it's true belief it'll sh in you what you do that's why Noah built an ark that's right he believed the warning that God said that's why Moses got there and killed all them Lambs he believed they were leaving come on somebody come on somebody that's why Daniel didn't stop praying he realized that God would hear him he believed it the Bible said in I uh sorry Psalms chapter 78 78 and10 here you find when the Israelites were murmuring they said the Bible said they kept not the Covenant of God and refused to walk in his law go down to verse 19 and the Bible said and yet y they spake against God they said can God furnish a table in the wilderness now I'll be honest out of any generation to this time there was not anybody that had seen the dispensation or the display of almighty God like the children of Israel so basically when you boil down what they are saying they are calling into question the ability of God they were calling and saying that he is no longer the same they were saying that God has changed his name and that God is no longer Jehovah Gyra they are saying that he cannot provide for them in no matter what the circumstances may I just remind you how big God was to them when God began to rain down Mana from Heaven that when he begin to rain it down the amount per person to each Israelite received an R which is about 2 lers per day so in total the amount per day that was poured out upon the Israelites if if we look at it that brother Randon would say that the Israelites that the children of Israel were around 2 million people so if we believe it was 2 million people that mean God provided 4 million quartz every single day he provided 3600 tons in excess every single day over a year he provided 1.3 million tons of mana and here they're saying that God can't do it when he begin to rain down quailes from heaven in numbers you find it in numbers 11 you'll find that the quail begin to pile up three feet deep around the camp and the Bible said that it stretched out a Day's Journey in every direction so 15 miles that way and 15 milesi that way was nothing but quails now I have to be honest with you the way I shoot that's probably about the only chance I'd ever have at hitting a squail I'd have a good chance at end so let me put it into perspective each person gathered 10 homers of quail that's about 60 bushels it's about 475 gallons of quail per person I tell you what that's my kind of hunting right there I might be able to do some good right there let me ask you something is he still Jehovah Gyra is he still Jehova did he put you right down here in Satan's Eden and leave you without did he leave you without did he did he did he not give you enough that you could stand there and say nah I don't believe he's still God did he did he not do enough enough for Georgie Carter to make you believe did he not do enough for Charlie Mitchell that was a coal miner that had cancer in his lungs never seen William brandham was visited had been brought there by by my my father's former Pastor Ernest vulture brought him up there William Bon didn't know nothing about him but he called him out when he's standing there and he said this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears did he not do enough for you when he healed that little girl down there in Memphis Tennessee did he not do enough for you when he created squirrels spoke to a storm created and destroyed tumors cast out cast out storms did he not do enough for you I say has I say he's still God I say he's still Jehovah [Applause] I want you to hear me loud and clear I never saw one of them Miracles but I believe him I want to say this that God would never have to do anything else for me to believe in him if he never did another miracle sister Gabrielle I would still trust him if he never healed me one more time I would still trust him if he didn't move on one other person's heart I would still trust him why because he's God to me if he didn't provide healing for my body one more time I would still realize that he has anointed me to stand in the face of my enemies why because he provided a message that is greater than Satan's eeden let the scoffers come let the mockers come I know who side of the table I'm on I know what side of the table I'm on now I I I studying I'm I'm I'm I'm bringing this to a close I pray I ain't hurt my body too much but I I feel I feel real good I studying and I was wanting to find exactly the amount and I it probably it probably escaped me but I was wondering to find how many times that Jesus stood in the face of critics and Believers people that believed in him and people that did not believe in him and the best of my recollection there's 13 times that Jesus is standing in front of critics that did not believe him but he was still anointed to heal he was still anointed to touch he was still anointed to save I I began to study that little that little thought that that's a very powerful thought I studyed that out and you look at Luke Chapter 5 and Matthew or Mark chapter 2 and you find that and I love it that the Bible said that that Jesus it was noised abroad that Jesus was in the house there ought to be some noise in here why because Jesus is in the house and Jesus begin to sit down at a table and he starts talking to them about Christ he starts talking to them about the scripture and he starts laying some fundamental foundations of who he is and what the scriptures are and all of a sudden they it's it's got so big that the house can't contain it no more and it kind of broke out like a wildfire and people have gathered all the way around and there was a there was a man that had some friends that was real good friends and they cared enough to get him in the house and they seen they couldn't get him through the doorways they couldn't get him through the windows and I believe that if you're persistent enough you'll get to where Jesus is at I say if it's if it's if it's noised alloud long loud enough I believe your friends will come here you hear me I believe that if you noise it loud enough that God saved you from a dying drunk drunken sinner I believe that if you announce it now I don't know whether they'll be elected or not but I believe this that if you announce it enough it'll cause an attraction it might be just for somebody's healing but for this man it was going to be worth it that he had some belev in friends that took their faith and they really believed it and they didn't just care about who saw them they begin to rip the shingles off the straw off and they begin to lower him down I say you ought to have that kind of Faith to tear the roof off this place but Jesus standing there and he looked at him and he said thy sins be forgiven let me say this it's one thing for me and brother William talk about it it's one thing for us as ministers and Christian Believers to talk about it but when you are in the face of the ultimate critic you talking about ultimate ultimate these are the best critics that was ever born as brother Matthew talked about it last night they had studied with everything that was with these are ultimate critics and Jesus begins to show who he is because the Bible said that he perceived that they said in their hearts what are these blasphemies that a man can be saved that thy sins are forgiven and Jesus picks it up he said let me ask you something is it harder to say that thy sins be forgiven or to say rise up and walk and he looked at the man he said thy sins be forgiven rise up and walk don't go back to your ped no more don't go back to your pity no more don't go back to your sin no more rise up and walk in the face of the critic across the table Jesus announces he is the son of [Applause] man I want to say this again God's already got your table set he's got your table set now I'm I'm just be real honest with you I love my wife more than anything she can't he be here today my little girl got a little temperature and she we been careful I love my wife's cooking more than I'll just be honest I Lord I'm gaining some points today Brothers didn't even mean to do it but praise God I love my wife's cooking I'm I'll just be honest with you I love it she Seasons things just the way I like them and when I don't like it that way she reminds me that I do I'll just be honest with you I love her cooking I love it she don't make him biscuits and gravies too much but thank God it's probably a good thing she don't y'all ought have seen them biscuits of gravy my teeny used to make had about that much oil in the bottom of the Pan Man our our ERS were so greased up I tell you what you could run on motor oil for the rest of your life I love her cooking I really do I tell you there so many things that she makes that are so good and I I love to come home and enjoy a good meal with her sit down at the table but if I really want to treat her like a like a wife to me I don't want her to have to fool with the dishes and fool with making me a good meal what I want to do I I'm sure some people enjoy good potluck every once in a while but I don't want to take my wife to a potluck when I want to take her somewhere nice but when I want to really take her somewhere nice it's not that often but when I really want to take her somewhere nice I've taken her them places that's got the lights turned down where you can't see whether there's a hair in your food or not you know what I mean is at least you got a candle there to make it more enjoyable hair is a beautiful thing until you falls off your head gets in your food it's amazing but to be honest I really don't want to spend all of my energies and watch her make all the meals and do all those things and just to sit back and say that was nice honey but if I really want to treat her right I take her to a real nice place where I know ain't going to be nothing like that everything's just right and I know she's going to like the food she ain't going to have to worry about it being good or not but it's real nice I want you to know that brother Brandon would say that that table is already set you ain't going to have to do nothing little bride the table's already set you ain't got to provide the bread you ain't got to provide the meet the angels are going to sit back and watch when he comes and we have that me meeting place that he loves to take us to the meeting in the air he's going to meet us and take us to that table that's set down a th000 miles long you ain't going to have to provide nothing for it that everything and every enemy that ever come against you ain't even going to be in view I want I want to just get this very clear for you today if I I wish I I wish I'd have thought about this before but sometimes it just happens maybe Titus and uh mcclard can come sit here I know your name it's Christian it's a good one if y'all don't know him he's a real good Christian come on come on up here Elijah come on up here Noah y'all ahead and have a seat down here and we got a great big table set up here beforeand and I want you to know that on this table on this table is set out in front of you overcoming power there comes stimulation by Revelation right there there there's a great big glass of that wine sitting there and there is there is the fruit of the spirit that is sitting there you mind if I sit down with you I believe we're going to sit together and we're going to sit right here and depression can look at you all they want to and fear can look at you all they want to and anxiety can look at you all they want to but they can't get to you [Applause] I want to say this to you trouble can sit on the other side of the table and it can roar and it can howl and it can scream but it can't get to you I want you to know that God has invited your enemies here to lay osia to watch you win to watch you overcome let me say this it's good to be on this side of the table because the enemy thinks are still on that side of the table but they didn't put themselves here their M and daddies didn't put them here they might have been born in the right families but their masas and daddies didn't put them here election put them here Fear Can torment them anxiety can holler at them peer pressure can scream at them but God put them on that side of the table and they ain't got to do nothing but live it out and eat what's on the table I say Brothers eat overcoming power eat the blood of Jesus eat this message day in and day out you're
