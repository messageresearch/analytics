just get up and say we're dismissed amen God bless you we so love you wasn't last night awesome amen amen we just certainly enjoyed that if you will turn with me in your scriptures today I'd like to go to Revelations 12 and verse 7 then Isaiah 54 amen amen hallelujah he's just wonderful to us I'd like to speak to you on the Duel of our challenge amen Revelations CH 12 and verse 7 and there was war in heaven and Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought against and his angels and Prevail not neither was there Place found anymore in heaven and the Great Dragon was cast out the old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world world and he was cast into the Earth and his angels were cast out with him and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now has come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down which accused them before our God day and night and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives unto the death Isaiah 54 and verse 16 very familiar portion of scripture behold I have created the Smith that bloweth the coals and the fire and bringeth forth an instrument for his work and I have created the waser to destroy now think about that God's reminding us I created your enemy and if he has a beginning he has an end if he has a beginning he has an end and the difference between him and us we were with God before there was even a beginning good way to start we win now I want you to read this next verse with me and I want you to mean it no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper and every tongue that shall arise against thee in judgment Thou shalt condemn this is the heritage of the Servants of the Lord and their righteousness is of me sayeth the Lord you may be seated amen would' like for you to remember us in prayer this week we will be at UVA Cancer Center on Monday Tuesday and Wednesday uh lot of decisions to be made thank you brother Matthew I believe you read my mind and so and so there's a lot of decisions that are to be looked at and to be made made they'll be looking first of all we have a surgery on Tuesday and that is to remove a blood clot uh apparatus that is there to take it out and may have to put one back in then on Wednesday we start very early in the morning and start having MRIs and scans and then we will see most all the cancer team and uh that's from my torso to my brain and then and then we should know something toward the end of the day uh maybe late late Wednesday evening and so and so these are very uh important dates if you will remember us in prayer as we go through it as human beings we always have a little anxiety uh of what we could be facing or what we're going but we've already read the report that's what we believe and we we know that we're the winner either way and so remember Sister Connie uh Miss Ally is at home sick today and so sister Connie is watching over her amen when I was a little boy I I don't know maybe maybe probably none of you ever watched a guy named gun from Gunsmoke and he would walk right out in the middle of the of the street and as I watched him I watched him for years forgive me he never lost he never lost he had a limp and was a fake limp but he had a limp and and uh he was a big guy and always wor he's had a certain way and you know as I grew up I wanted to be a cowboy but as As Time elapsed I realized I was too short I was just too short and uh I I realized I wasn't going to get to do that and so and and I always remembered that you know you know sometimes you know the music would begin to play and it would it would get to be you know kind of a panic-like pace and you know and you knew all along he's going to win am I mean you could almost read the script uh he's going to win uh uh Matthew Dylan is he's going to win and but your heart was racing mine was and you know it kind of almost gave you a little bit of a fever pitch that your your heart was racing and you know then after you know that was an hour show and so then after you get toward that 50 55 minutes that's where the fight takes place and and you know at the end of the 55 minutes and the 56 right through there they're they're enjoying the accolades of Victory and and you're sitting there go go want to give he W again well you knew that now I told you that story and and here we've been Christian some of you are brand new never heard me before preach and some of you are been here forever and yet Satan can make you feel like in a trial the music is bumping in and you feel so anxious as you come to certain spots in your life and and you're going through job situation marriage situation children situations and all different kinds of things and Doctor reports and all that and the music is and listen in the 56th minute you know you're going to win relax Amen Let me give you let me give you some real good news you win tell your neighbor we win now if I could think about it if we were a we were a uh we were a Fight Pro promoter and we were a guy that was in charge of literally billions of dollars to get the best heavyweight weight fight that you could get to put it together and you had Muhammad Ali on one side of the card and the other side you get a six-year-old kid nobody's coming nobody's coming so you get a George Foreman or or a Frasier or you you boy that sounded good didn't it or you get you get a a man that is up for the challenge now they're going to spend months to prepare and they begin to you know the music is playing and nobody really knows who's going to win here you and and literally incredible they begin to bet and they begin to do a lot of things who wins who wins who wins and and in a second it can be over in a second it can just be over and it's done now I want to just draw your thoughts just for a few minutes God knows he's going to win so when he's creating an enemy to literally share with us what redemp is all about and overcoming is all about he creates an enemy that that enemy has to believe he's going to win and he's fought in heaven he's been cast into the Earth and here we've got thousands of years that he's fought our brothers and sisters all the way through the scriptures and in God's predestinated plan he he chooses who will live in certain days and let's just say it who's going to be my Overcomer who's going to be my Overcomer I I'll take Noah I I'll take Abraham I I'll take this and no matter how formidable their enemy was they won are you with me now now I I I want you to notice that all the way down through they've had to meet the challenges of the hour now if you were Noah and the door is shut and now people are laughing and making fun you know that you didn't shut the door you built the ark according to the speck of God you preached the message you know you know in a few days you don't know when you're not in control it's up to God that's right and you know in a few days God's going to wash the Earth yes sir you've only found Grace in the eyes of God you've got friends you've got people out there that has been close to you and they're making fun they're hanging around just in case God didn't put a door down to where he could he himself could open it put a little bitty window in a spot and you know the sun came up the next day and the sun came up the next day and the sun came up the next day you know the devil always gets in your mind well it hadn't taken place yet it hadn't taken look what a fool you are look God's not doing it look God's not doing it you got all these animals in this hot box and he's Waring in your minds but let me just say this when the heavens turn black when the heavens turn black and the rain that had never fell and the Billows of the deep opened up everybody became a Believer everybody wanted to be on the ark but the message had put them in position are you with me God puts us in a strain to allow us to feel that pressure and that intensity even knowing that we win the devil Whispers In Your Ear well you've been to coming to church 30 or 40 years they've been preaching Rapture all the time Israel's doing what they're doing America's doing what they're doing all of this pressure that's going on and there's nothing happening really the message has put us in the right spot listen when you can't see anything happening it's happening when you don't feel nothing moving it's moving when you don't feel nothing shaking it's shaking this world is falling apart we [Applause] win Goliath screaming he didn't realize he only had days to live he had came to a spot to challenge God's people even in their back sliding unable to meet the challenge of the hour here come a boy a boy that was ready to meet the challenge listen is Israel's going to win they just don't know how they're going to win over that don't get all tore all the pieces as they're going to win the whole world is gathered against him but they're going to win brother Goliath don't know it's going to be his last day but God prepared a hero he prepared a boy that would be king that would create the Throne of David listen God had big plans for for this boy I'd like to remind you God has big plans for you look past your troubles look past your Sorrows look past your anxieties God placed a potential on the inside of you to overcome in this realm but not just this realm God's got plans he's got a marriage supper he's got a millennium period he's got eternity [Music] to spin with you imagine how great God's plans are we're living in Satan's Eden I think about how God that created the heavens and the Earth and he said let there be right God spoke the world into existence it and for thousands of years all of these great minds didn't know that there was coal in the earth they didn't know there was natural the natural gas in the earth they didn't know all of these elements were in the earth inside of the earth until this day amen they rode by horseback by whatever that they could go by but in this day we have created cars that can fly down the road amen sometimes you're driving at 70 miles an hour and somebody goes by you that's right you get on a plane I'm not getting on a rocket and you think all of that came with from within the Earth that God created it I'm fishing for you now you just cannot realize the potential that God placed in you you cannot real you just sometimes see this out facade but you just cannot realize how powerful the word of God is that he placed on the inside of you Kings and priest and Overcomers ladies of Grace Queens Of Heaven in me brother Ron absolutely on the inside of you God placed his diamonds on the inside of you well brother Ron I don't know all about that well have you ever listened to the fellow that Whispers in your ear and he tells you you're nothing and you know you or something right he tells you you'll never make it and you know what the book says about you he tells you you're sick and you're going to die and then you believe God at his report regardless of what the doctors [Music] say how you know that brother Ron I'll be preaching for you next Sunday that's just an example for you that's an example for you I'm not believing that when they run the MRI that I'm going to have more brain tumors and they're going to have to operate on me immediately I'm I'm not going to even go there I believe I'm already working on next week's sermon so that's what we do that's what we believe Hallelujah now if I can live in the 56th minute of the program what about you brother Ron but you're not in my shoes well you want to be in mine you want to try that on for size for a little bit everybody can talk big and tell all of a sudden you get hit in the mouth Isaiah 43 and: 2 when th passest through the waters I will be with thee I want you to think about this who's with you we heard the song Amen when I'm in the storm he's with me I will be with thee through the rivers they shall not overflow thee when thou walkest through the fire thou shall not be burnt brother Ron you walked through the fire you you were laying in a coma and it took a long time do I look like I've been in a fire we get this real short time window well it didn't happen it didn't happen well look look 15 17 years later do I look look like I've been in a fire when they told me I'd never walk again that night I walked out of the hospital am do I look like a paralyzed man I'm trying to make this scripture live for you don't look at your temporary window come on when I was laying in the hospital and I couldn't look up at the light because a stroke that had happened to me I just I kept in My Mind who I really was don't forget who you are and if you're God's son and you're God's daughter you can't lose Psalms chapter 73 and verse 26 My Flesh and my heart faileth but God is the strength of my heart my portion forever Isaiah 40 and verse 29 he giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might he increases strength so my words to you this morning is don't forget where your source of strength is I find it absolutely amazing when you get in the heat of a trial or the heat of the thing the devil will tell you don't go to church and it tell you them people don't love you you just lay out you just lay out you just lay out you know what you'll do you'll so backslide but when you come to church and all of a sudden somebody turns around and tells you you just don't know how much I love you and then they just blast the devil's thoughts out all week long somebody walks up and hugs you and say we're just glad to see you in the house of the Lord they do not realize the devil has wored all week long with that person and you by the power of the word of the Lord speak strength to them bo [Applause] boo brother BR says everything had to know that he'd conquered when he shut the door on them and the days of mercies was passing on on down through the lowest pits of hell he went and he knocked at the city doors of the devil's hell you talking about a duel and the Devil comes to the door and as we could look to see and there he there he said well here you are after all I thought I had you when I killed the prophets I was sure that I had you when I cut John's head off in prison but now after all you're here and I can hear him say as he straightened himself up and said Satan I'm the Virgin born son of the Living God my blood is still wet on the cross I paid the price I've conquered and I've come down here to take over strip you of everything that you claimed that you had and he reached over on his side and jerked those keys of death and hell off of him and kicked him back into the place place where he belonged he conquered hell and when he arose he had the keys of death hell hanging on his side so what's the church scared about then he conquered Satan he conquered sickness he conquered death he conquered hell I want you to say this with me what's the church scared about then chur scared let's say it a different way why am I scared I scared he conquered Satan he conquered sickness he conquered death he conquered hell let's say it again like we really meant it he conquered hell Give the Lord a good hand right there Ephesians chapter 6 and verse 10 finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might and put on the whole armor of God that ye may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world and against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having to done all to stand stand therefore having your loins GED about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shot with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taken the shield of Faith wherewith you may be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God praying always let's read this verse together praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching there un with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints can can you say this I am a Son of God I am a daughter of God I came from God and I'm going to go back to God what a position to stand in now I want to talk to you about prayer the things that we do brother random said the only way that I know to do is prayer prayer is the key that's the answer say brother but I got a lot of questions prayer is your answer Prayer Changes Things prayer is the most powerful weapon that was ever put in the control of human beings notice now what he says there's no atomic bomb or no hydrogen bomb as powerful as prayer then when your enemy is wiring you out during the day he will do his best to keep you from when Andrew got in trouble he didn't waste a second calling on and he took care of it if Andrew could do that come on don't you re I'm not advocating fighting I'm just telling you how that happened if we as the most powerful people on the Earth forget our [Applause] weapons oh but I think I'm a I think I'm an overcomer really it's got to be go past thought that's right yeah are you with me listen let me just say this to you brother Tim did such an eloquent job here about two two last two times he said God's give us the car and we've got all the mechanics right we need the Dynamics to make it go down the road we have an incredible message it can't get better this message can't get better God gave us the greatest message on the Earth but now we want it more than just in pictures and tapes and books it's got to live God's not coming back to Rapture your tape recorder or your books or your picture on the wall he's coming to re to Rapture you you are where the message lives God hated that little prophet he hated him he did everything to destroy him but now that little Prophet the message delivered don't get mad what brother Andrew said last night brother brandham did the message and the Lord took him home he's not coming back to repr preach the message you've got it you got it take it and live and defeat the Devil defeat leosia we are the final Runners here and no matter how much Satan dos against you he loses and every one of you will have an individual Rapture we're not going to hold hands around the world and just take off flying in the sky but you will over come in Gros and in Elon in West Virginia and in South Carolina and Zimbabwe in New Zealand brother George in Ireland your people there and Brother David mayor there in Switzerland and France you remember when God said let there be maybe you don't remember it but it happened how powerful is our God I don't know if he can overcome I don't know if he can do this or I don't know if you that would be kind of like me saying well I don't know if he's greater than the cancer that I'm baren what a silly statement that would be when I think that God said let there be a son and when there was no son he spoke it into existence he believed his own word and the sun came into existence and get the backdrop of the dark sky stars begin to fall and wrot his first Bible there and those stars have no illuminous or no light within themselves but they reflect the light of the Sun and in the darkest of nights and the darkest of nights they shine maybe millions of miles [Music] away God in the darkness of Leia and he knew you were coming and one day you realize who you really are and you know that you don't have light for yourself but you reflect the light of Our Lord Jes Jesus Christ Living in the darkest of the day and against the backdrop of cancer and the backdrop of politics and the backdrop of [Applause] Sodom Jordan you just shine you just shine and you don't even have to make yourself do it Jordan I was talking to him a minute ago and now I got two Jordans time last we probably have four

mind and and he brings unbelief and he brings doubt when you're put in a puzzle together trying to make this work out and that workout you just sometimes it's hard to get the right pieces am in it but if you allow God in his season he gives you a job he'll give you a home he'll give you a wife he'll give you 14 children that boy going to be busy ain't he I'm giving you an illustration so many times we cross bridges for we ever get to them how many's ever had a worry wart in their in your life worry wart how many knows what a weary W is the glass is always half empty and it's always half this and it's always against them and always dark and it's all people punching each other all over this building if I could get you to stop a minute just stop worry only drains you it's the enemy of Faith stop stop worrying reach over and tell your neighbor stop worrying you've been punching them anyway I want to remind you you youve got God in your boat you've got God in your fire all you've got to do is take the take the rope and swing it God will make the rock go exactly where it needs to go before Elijah ever started calling fire down from heaven he knew it was on its way when brother Brandon was preaching to people that didn't believe and making fun he just kept preaching cuz listen down the road there's a bride that's going to want to hear this they're going to believe it with all their hearts well brother Ron I got a lot of crck critics they're supposed to be there they're placed there but you win you win tell your neighbor you winu sh guard jumped out of a window he had a six foot stick in his hand right he whipped 600 Soldiers with all kind of equipment to whip him but it's a stupid devil because the scripture said one man can take a thousand the devil is not as smart as he lets on that he is if he'd have brought a,10 he'd have had a little better chance but he brought 400 less than what the word call for and it may feel like 500 Devils has showed up at your house on Monday morning stupid devil you are are an invincible Army Hallelujah I'd like to let locen preach but I I know I know and then they go back to hell and they talk about that little old woman up there from the church that whipped them all day long they got whipped by a woman sister just raise your hand and go with just wave just wave it just wave it oh come on come on Wave it baby wave it wait a bit baby I'm who you looking for I'm the one that whipped you last week go ahead wave that thing with some attitude you tried you tried to stop me last week look where I'm at today woo woo now devil if you didn't get pictures quick enough you can go back and watch the archive but these are the girls that whipped you last week and you tried to keep them out of church and get them depressed these are the it's getting good Satan in the name of Jesus Christ I come in this Duel of Faith challenging not in my own power or name and you know that I could not do that but I come as a representative of Jesus Christ claiming a Divine gift that was ministered to me by an Angel telling me that to get the people to believe that the sickness would not stand before them with a sincere prayer was made and I pray sincerely to God therefore you cannot hold the women any longer I charge thee by the Son of God Jesus Christ come out of that woman Satan another quote Satan an angel of God came 14 years ago in Greens Mill one night and told me as a local Minister that I was sent to pray for the sick and this is told is what was told you're aware of that I like that I like it when he comes right down to it you're aware of that well brother on that was brother brandham well remind him when he comes to attack you I I'd like to take you back when the Holy Ghost came on my life now Satan God came down and filled my life with the Holy Ghost which means that it's a seal on me that God has signed that I am his Hallelujah and he'll never leave me he'll never forsake me but he'll be with me to the end I and you're aware of that and if you're aware of that you know you're with I like that don't you now you're exposed you can have unbelief in the PE people you can make people doubt but you can't make Christ do anything because he stripped you of every legal right that you ever had when he died at Calvary he paid the debt of all of us sin and unbelief and God has given his servants power to cast you out I use his name I come in the name of Jesus Christ and I challenge you to a duel of Faith leave the girl and come out of her in the name of Jesus Christ perseverance he said but you have found something you pick up the sword see now of course you got a hindrance you got something that's going to duel against you that devil that disease that Affliction but when you strike the tip of the swords with the devil Yonder and say it's thus sayith the Lord he's revealed it to me I am healed write it on your refrigerator write it on your for if you need to I am healed when you realize that God has revealed to you the truth of the living there's nothing in the world that is going to defeat you in it you're absolutely undefeatable won't you say that with me I am undefeatable you didn't say it with attitude I am absolutely undefeatable I am absolutely undefeatable now do you believe you're a liar or do you believe what God Said brother Ron do you know something I don't know no I'm just telling you if you get this service next week's going to be [Applause] better not you but the god that's in you not Christ not the body but this the word that was in him not Mary but the word that was born in her your flesh will shake your flesh will get nervous but the word that's in you you that's been married sometime and you're welcome to punch your wife tell her perk up here you that's been married sometimes realize that words are powerful amen how many has ever said something you really didn't mean to say but you let it Escape over your lips and you spend days and weeks wishing you hadn't said it I'm not going to look but would you just raise your hand so if the enemy can use your tongue and get you to feel bad for all that length of time how much more can God so if you can make a practice of letting positive words go across your lips even when you're thinking negative thoughts how many has negative thoughts go through your mind oh we got angels here Angels Among Us Angels Among Us hallelujah thank the Lord for Angels Among Us we're always thrilled With Angels Among Us most time we can't see them but we see them [Applause] today brother R but I'm a Son of God I I'm a daughter of God I I I I'm absolutely undefeatable you're still a human you're still a human and so negative thoughts will go through your mind because remember greatest battle ever fought God and the enemy chose a place to fight in your flesh you are a personal dominion and they fight in your flesh in your mind are you with me and listen your flesh is not born again your flesh is not born again even your spirit is not born again but but the Jean seed of God has came to life and this is the house that it lives in oh I feel like shouting this is the house that it lives in and if you look in the mirror it wasn't many decades ago that you used to drink and smoke and do all different kind of things that you're ashamed of same house new king Samson was met on the field one day with a thousand Philistines around him and he looked all around and he wasn't a trained man but that knew how to doel but when he turned his head he felt the Covenant them locks strike his shoulders that's all he had to feel he got the first thing in his hand was a Jawbone of a mule and he beat down a thousand Philistines why he was persistence because he knowed that God had made a covenant with him and those Seven Locks as long as they hung in their place there was nothing right going to bother him oh I love that oh brothers and sisters how the Church of the Living God ought to stand in tonight persistent as long as we can feel the Covenant of the Holy Spirit the blood of Jesus Christ cleansing us from all sin amen we should never let nothing stand in our way can I say it again we should
