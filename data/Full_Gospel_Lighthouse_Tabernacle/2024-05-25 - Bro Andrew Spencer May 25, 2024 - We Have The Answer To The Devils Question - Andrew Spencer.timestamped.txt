[19:38] in such a way that we can say that's not
[19:40] man's doing it's
[19:42] supernatural father I pray that you
[19:44] would just allow your Holy Spirit to

[20:30] personable tonight you'd make yourself
[20:32] known in a very specific way that we
[20:35] could literally see you by the power of
[20:39] the preach's word Lord we devote oursel
[20:42] to you just now in this service in Jesus
[20:45] name amen am and amen if you have your
[20:49] Bibles we like to turn over to Matthew
[20:52] chapter 4 and verse one Matthew chapter
[20:56] 4 and verse one
[20:58] and as you're as you're turning there
[21:00] I'd like to I'd like to share this
[21:03] quotation from Christ The Mystery of God
[21:07] revealed and basically just draw our our
[21:10] context tonight from this from this
[21:12] quote brother randam said in paragraph
[21:15] 580 he said when we see all these great
[21:17] three-fold revelation God in Christ
[21:21] Christ in the church the kingdom coming
[21:24] Adam and Eve redeemed back to the Garden
[21:26] of Eden in the representation of Christ
[21:28] and his bride and then the kingdom is
[21:31] going to be restored according to his
[21:33] promise he said praise be to God now by
[21:36] by the one revelation of the three-fold
[21:38] mystery the secret and by the personal
[21:40] Vindicated word by his original headship
[21:44] not say well glory to God we shout
[21:46] hallelujah we sing that ain't it I'm a
[21:48] missionary I've been seven times
[21:50] practically over the world and I've seen
[21:52] heathens and devils and everything else
[21:54] dance and shout and I've seen all kinds
[21:55] of fleshly manifestation he said that's
[21:57] carnal he said but I'm talking about
[21:59] that headship of Christ notice being
[22:03] personally identified by the original
[22:05] headship we have the answer to the
[22:08] devil's question amen glory we have the
[22:11] answer to the devil's question he Christ
[22:14] is risen and has paid the price and
[22:18] raising up the head or the body Matthew
[22:21] chapter 4 and verse
[22:24] one then was Jesus led up of the spirit
[22:27] Into the Wilderness to be tempted of the
[22:29] devil and when he had fasted 40 days and
[22:31] 40 nights he was afterward a hungered
[22:34] and when the tempter came to him he said
[22:37] if thou be the Son of God command these
[22:39] Stones be made bread but he answered and
[22:42] said it is written man shall not live by
[22:44] bread alone but by every word that
[22:46] proceedeth out of the mouth of God then
[22:48] the devil taketh him up into a holy city
[22:50] and set him on a pinnacle of the temple
[22:53] and said unto him if thou be the Son of
[22:55] God cast thyself down for it is written
[22:59] he said give his Angel he shall give his
[23:01] angels charge concerning thee and in
[23:04] their hands shall they bear thee up lest
[23:06] at any time thou Dash thy foot against a
[23:09] stone and Jesus said unto him it is
[23:12] written again Thou shalt not tempt the
[23:14] Lord thy God and again the devil taketh
[23:16] him up into an exceeding high mountain
[23:19] and showing him all the kingdoms of the
[23:21] world and the glory of them and saith
[23:25] unto him all these things will I give
[23:27] thee if thou will fall down and worship
[23:30] me then saith Jesus unto him get thee
[23:33] hint Satan for it is written Thou shalt
[23:35] Worship the Lord thy God and him only
[23:38] shalt thou serve then the devil leaveth
[23:41] him and behold Angels Came and
[23:45] ministered unto him may God bless his
[23:47] word you may be seated here tonight in
[23:49] the presence of the Lord from these from
[23:52] these thoughts here this evening I would
[23:53] like to speak to you we have the answer
[23:57] to the devil's question question the
[23:59] answer to the devil's question I know
[24:01] that we've got many of kids just now
[24:03] that are that are beginning their summer
[24:05] break or getting ready to start their
[24:07] summer break and I know that every one
[24:09] of these these little guys are super
[24:11] excited about that and I remember as a
[24:13] child I always always prayed Lord let
[24:16] the Rapture happen between summer break
[24:18] so I wouldn't have to go back and while
[24:20] I'm still here preaching and but he he
[24:24] still comes he still comes every time he
[24:26] comes to these services and I know that
[24:28] these little guys are certainly excited
[24:30] to be out on on on spring or summer
[24:33] break and going to enjoy all of the
[24:35] elements of summertime and being away
[24:37] from being away from school but just
[24:40] having this context on our thought I
[24:42] begin to think about I begin to think
[24:44] about when I was in school how that the
[24:46] the teachers the ma especially the Math
[24:48] teachers they didn't necessarily like
[24:50] how I did things because they they would
[24:52] set out problems on a per piece of paper
[24:54] and different things and they'd want you
[24:56] to line out how that you got the answer
[24:58] answer or the solution to the answer and
[25:00] you know I I was that kind of visionary
[25:02] person and I just I found the answer in
[25:04] my mind and I wrote it down well they
[25:06] didn't like that too much and they they
[25:08] wanted to see how you got the answer how
[25:10] that you came across the answer and the
[25:12] solution of it and and brother brandom
[25:14] actually I found that brother Brandon
[25:15] picks that up and proving his word he
[25:17] said he said I remember in school he
[25:18] said I learned something and many of you
[25:20] learn the same lesson he said when
[25:21] you've solved a problem and worked it
[25:23] out you can take the answer and prove it
[25:25] by the problem you can take the answer
[25:28] and prove it by the problem and he he
[25:30] went on to say he said so if you prove
[25:32] he said your answer he said if your
[25:33] answer if you prove your answer by the
[25:36] problem then why not prove the answer
[25:38] that we're now getting by the word of
[25:40] this age he said if the Bible speaks
[25:43] that a certain thing is to happen in
[25:45] this age and he said it's in the Bible
[25:47] it will happen he said then if your
[25:49] answer that you're trying to tell the
[25:51] people if it's proven by the book by the
[25:53] book then it's true it's it's true
[25:56] otherwise it isn't so we literally are
[25:59] able to take the problems that we come
[26:01] up against and we can take the answer
[26:04] and prove the problems that there is an
[26:07] answer there is an answer to all of
[26:09] life's problems right here laying in the
[26:12] word of God now I I know that we're all
[26:14] familiar we're all familiar with going
[26:16] to a car car salesman and and buying a
[26:18] car and having that car salesman
[26:20] experience and there's there's one thing
[26:22] that I personally can't understand about
[26:24] or can't I can't halfway deal with it it
[26:26] gets on my ever loving nerves is when
[26:28] they when you go to a car salesman and
[26:30] they don't know what they're selling to
[26:32] you but me and Matthew we're we're tring
[26:33] to Matthew's my car guru and if I'm
[26:35] buying a truck or buying something for
[26:37] the business I I tell him exactly what
[26:39] we're looking for he studies out every
[26:41] little detail and we show up there we
[26:43] know every we know everything that it's
[26:45] supposed to do where we know all the
[26:47] Dynamics of it because we've studied it
[26:48] out and I can't stand it when when a car
[26:51] salesmen don't know what they're talking
[26:52] about and you can I I hate being a know
[26:54] it all but when you can stand there and
[26:56] start telling that now that that's not
[26:58] right that that isn't for this kind of
[26:59] stroke motor that's for that's for that
[27:01] kind of a stroke motor and you go
[27:03] through those certain things I I really
[27:04] dislike when somebody don't know exactly
[27:06] what they're talking about and they're
[27:07] trying to sell you something that's kind
[27:09] of like a preacher that don't know Jesus
[27:11] and he's trying to sell you something
[27:13] and ain't you ain't in a you ain't in a
[27:15] buying mood you'd rather go somewhere
[27:16] else and buy from it but I believe that
[27:18] I believe that there's one thing about
[27:20] Jesus that Jesus never had to sell
[27:22] himself is that the word sold itself for
[27:25] him he never had to prove that he was a
[27:27] word he simply was the word and the word
[27:30] took care of the matters that had come
[27:31] up against every problem every problem
[27:34] that he ever came up against the word
[27:36] settled the problems that he ever came
[27:38] up against is that right when you look
[27:40] in the days of Noah when you look there
[27:42] there was a problem which was the rain
[27:44] but the ark was the answer when you look
[27:47] in the days of Moses the children of
[27:49] Israel were in bondage but you see the
[27:52] there that was the problem they were in
[27:53] bondage but the message that Moses had
[27:56] received was the answer to the problem
[27:58] problem that they were in and Satan has
[28:00] always wondered if if if this is a seed
[28:03] or is that one a seed could this be the
[28:05] seed could he really be the Messiah
[28:07] could could he could they really leave
[28:09] Egypt could this one really be Malachi 4
[28:12] or could she be the Bride of Jesus
[28:14] Christ because Satan has always wondered
[28:17] if that's the seed or not now brother
[28:19] random said in the in the message
[28:21] Satan's eating he said I he said I
[28:23] wanted to speak to you something to
[28:25] bring you something to Enlighten you to
[28:27] the promise
[28:28] of of God for this age he said something
[28:31] not something that somebody else was in
[28:33] some other day he said but then he said
[28:35] them things is all right and we refer to
[28:37] those things he said but I thought that
[28:39] I would try to bring you something to
[28:40] your mind with these scriptures he said
[28:42] that I've got written here that would
[28:44] Enlighten you to know or to make you a
[28:47] better soldier in the field that you're
[28:49] fighting in now to learn the tactics of
[28:52] the enemy so that you can block
[28:53] everything before it gets to you he said
[28:56] that's the main thing is to learn to
[28:59] keep the punches off of you as much as
[29:02] you can he went on to say he said now I
[29:05] don't believe that there ever was a day
[29:07] he said that I've read in history he
[29:09] said there's been great days of
[29:10] persecution when the children of God was
[29:12] put to death on every hand he said but
[29:15] to see the deceitfulness of the enemy he
[29:17] said we've never had a day like this
[29:20] that we're now living he said it's the
[29:22] most cunning and deceitful day and he
[29:24] said when I see it he said it brings
[29:26] this that that the Christian has to be
[29:28] more on his toe today than he ever was
[29:31] in any age so the Christian has to be on
[29:34] his guard in this age more than any
[29:36] other age and you see how you're going
[29:39] to get through this age of great
[29:41] deceiving and cunning times it's because
[29:43] of the anointing of the hour that we are
[29:46] under that gives us the energy the
[29:49] pulsation to literally overcome the
[29:51] spirit of the enemy or the Antichrist
[29:54] that we are facing in this hour now we
[29:57] realize that way we are living at in
[29:59] This Time by modern events made clear by
[30:01] prophecy that we realize that we are
[30:03] facing the smoke from a bottomless pit
[30:06] that we read over in Revelations chapter
[30:08] n and you begin to study out Revelations
[30:10] chapter N9 and you see those
[30:12] Supernatural elements or the powers that
[30:15] are there that have rose up out of the
[30:17] bottomless pit that they are they are
[30:19] Supernatural powers that are against the
[30:22] moving of the Holy Ghost they are
[30:24] against the word of God and you watch
[30:26] the king Abad and rise out of that
[30:29] bottomless pit and brother bham picks
[30:31] that up in the Feast of the trumpets and
[30:33] he said it's supernatural demons he said
[30:36] it's supernatural Chargers that had been
[30:39] held for 2,000 years in the river of
[30:41] Euphrates he said they had been bound
[30:43] there they had been bound there all of
[30:46] those years and you notice this king's
[30:48] name abadin which means they destroy an
[30:50] Angel and I'll say he is a badden if I
[30:53] say if I I believe that I believe that
[30:55] John was writing these things down and
[30:58] Billy terms that the devil is a badden
[31:00] he certainly is a badden but a king has
[31:03] got demons that are under his under his
[31:06] handle and those demons are designed or
[31:09] built to attack the very people that
[31:12] move towards the word of God that press
[31:15] towards his presence those demons are
[31:17] religious Spirits those demons are
[31:20] religious Spirits as the Bible would say
[31:23] as the Bible would say that literally
[31:25] their power is in their mouth
[31:28] their power is in their mouth by the
[31:30] tale that they're telling and brother
[31:32] Brandon picks that up and he said he
[31:34] said it's that Roman that old Roman
[31:36] Empire that's revived itself again what
[31:40] is it it's their idology their ideology
[31:43] or their system of ideas now William
[31:45] brandom said he said now he said don't
[31:47] you fear that Iron Curtain he said but
[31:49] you feel that you fear that purple
[31:51] curtain keep your eyes on that he said
[31:54] don't you feel com don't you fear
[31:55] communism he said you watch that devil
[31:58] what is it in Catholicism it is a
[32:01] brainwashing of people through systems
[32:04] where they literally lose their identity
[32:06] of who they are and we're Liv in an age
[32:09] where men don't know what they are
[32:10] anymore and I'm not just talking about
[32:12] natural things but I'm talking about
[32:14] spiritual things Christians that claim
[32:17] to be Christians have lost their
[32:19] identity of what a Christian really
[32:22] is a Christian means to be Christlike
[32:26] and we got a bunch of people people in
[32:28] the world today that call themselves
[32:30] Christians but don't identify as a
[32:33] Christian come on somebody when a dog
[32:36] gives birth to a dog it looks like a dog
[32:39] when a when a cat gives birth to a cat
[32:41] it looks like a cat when a human gives
[32:44] birth to a human it looks like a human
[32:46] and when God gives birth to Sons and
[32:48] Daughters of God they ought to look like
[32:50] Sons and Daughters of God but Christians
[32:53] in this hour have lost their identity of
[32:56] what they are respecting for and what
[32:58] they are to look
[33:02] like that is one of Satan's greatest
[33:05] tactics is to steal away the identity of
[33:08] the hour or the identity of the believer
[33:11] of him and his position that he's
[33:14] standing in in the hour what is it what
[33:16] is it brother Bron would preach it down
[33:18] in Alabama he would call it spiritual
[33:21] Amnesia where the enemy would come in
[33:23] and steal away the identity and that's
[33:26] exactly what he did to
[33:28] that's what he what's that's exactly
[33:30] what the devil did to Legion he stole
[33:32] his identity away from him and what did
[33:35] he do what did he do he stole his
[33:37] identity and he displaced him what did
[33:40] he do he displaced the headship of the
[33:43] home and if Satan can rob your headship
[33:46] he can steal anything away from
[33:50] you if he can steal your headship he can
[33:53] steal anything away from you I I hope
[33:56] you hear what I'm saying to you today
[33:58] I'm not just talking about your natural
[34:00] home but if Satan can steal away the
[34:02] headship of the word of God he can steal
[34:05] everything from you come on somebody if
[34:08] he can steal a way that you don't need
[34:10] to be in church and you can stay at home
[34:13] he has stole away your identity if he
[34:16] can steal away and make you think you
[34:18] can live by just eating one meal every
[34:21] once in a month he has stolen away thine
[34:24] identity but children of God that fully
[34:28] are Under The Fellowship of the headship
[34:31] recognize the
[34:34] power you see what Satan is offering you
[34:37] he is offering you a foundation he's
[34:39] offering you a foundation that has no
[34:42] power Satan has no Foundation his
[34:46] foundation is built upon attacking the
[34:49] value of the word of God you see it
[34:53] literally when you begin to try to
[34:55] pierce through the darkness or the smoke
[34:57] of Le
[34:59] osia it's piercing that that smoke
[35:02] literally Gets In Your Eyes it gets in
[35:05] your it gets in your flesh it gets in
[35:08] the cabinets it gets in the drywall When
[35:11] the Smoke of the Furnace begins to blow
[35:15] you let one of your houses catch on fire
[35:17] you burn a bag of popcorn and you can't
[35:19] get the smell out of your house how much
[35:22] more powerful or pertinent is the smoke
[35:25] out of the bottomless pit when it gets
[35:27] into spiritual
[35:29] lives you see it affect everything it
[35:32] affects your vision it affects your
[35:34] lungs it affects is the way that you
[35:36] praise it affects the way that you pray
[35:39] it's affecting it is affecting the way
[35:41] that people find God people say well I
[35:44] ain't got time to pray and I ain't got
[35:46] time to serve God if Suzanne Wesley
[35:48] could pray two hours a day and raise 18
[35:51] children and raise up a prophet
[35:53] messenger or raise up a messenger of the
[35:55] age how much more
[35:58] with a p a push button Society should we
[36:01] be able to
[36:03] pray come on somebody until walls fall
[36:07] pray pray until Devils bow to the name
[36:11] of Jesus
[36:13] pray if Satan can steal your headship he
[36:16] stole your joy if Satan can steal your
[36:20] peace he's robbed you and he's giv you
[36:23] turmo instead of peace
[36:28] but God didn't leave you down
[36:31] here God didn't leave you down here in
[36:33] the midst of your crisis without a hope
[36:35] he didn't leave you down here in the
[36:37] midst of battle without strength because
[36:40] you roll the chapter over from
[36:42] Revelation chapter n to Revelations
[36:45] chapter 10 notice the first word
[36:49] and and is a conjunction and I saw
[36:53] another Mighty angel in the midst of
[36:55] this Bottomless Pit in the midst of this
[36:58] smoke there stood up a strong
[37:03] angel I'm going to let him out today
[37:06] come on somebody he didn't leave you
[37:08] without
[37:12] hope Smith wgg Smith Wigglesworth said
[37:16] that a man filled with the Holy Ghost
[37:18] can stand up and laugh in the face of a
[37:20] thousand
[37:22] difficulties it doesn't matter what
[37:24] comes up against you just rise up the
[37:26] Samson in your life
[37:28] and laugh at a thousand
[37:30] difficulties you are not without
[37:33] hope you are not without hope because in
[37:36] this hour you've got the same Authority
[37:39] as the same one that stood there in
[37:41] Matthew chapter 4 when he stood there
[37:43] and said get behind me Satan get behind
[37:46] me Satan Thou shalt not tempt the Lord
[37:48] thy God when Jesus was in his weakest
[37:51] moment Satan was in his strongest moment
[37:55] but Jesus did not answer him out of his
[37:58] emotions he did not answer him out of
[38:01] his feelings he did not answer him out
[38:03] of his flesh he answered him out of the
[38:06] word of God what are you saying to me
[38:09] brother Andrew it's not what you see
[38:12] it's not what you feel it's not what
[38:14] you're going through
[38:16] answer don't answer out of your weakness
[38:19] answer out of your stress the joy of the
[38:22] Lord is my strength
[38:28] oh glory be to
[38:30] God and a prophet told us that the word
[38:33] of God would affat the devil any time
[38:36] any place under any situation in the
[38:39] belly of a whale in the lon's den in a
[38:42] bed of cancer when you D underneath an
[38:45] automile automobile accident the Lord is
[38:48] my strength it is a tool for the weakest
[38:51] of Christians when Satan comes up
[38:54] against you he messed up because he
[38:56] ain't just messing with a human he's
[38:58] messing with Jesus
[39:01] again oh
[39:03] [Music]
[39:05] Hallelujah Jesus never doubted his
[39:08] position even in his weakness he never
[39:10] doubted his
[39:11] authority Hallelujah even in a situation
[39:16] when people walked away from him he did
[39:18] not question his authority he simply
[39:21] countered the problem by the
[39:25] word oh Lord
[39:28] I'll tell you brother Andrew I ain't got
[39:31] no strength let me tell you when you
[39:32] ain't got no strength he is your
[39:34] strength because Paul said in Colossians
[39:36] 1:11 strengthen with all might according
[39:39] to his glorious power under all patience
[39:41] and longsuffering with joyfulness
[39:44] Hallelujah Caleb said in Joshua
[39:49] 14:11 he said I may not look like it but
[39:52] I'm still as strong today as I was when
[39:55] the day that Moses promised me that that
[39:57] was my land I got enough strength to go
[40:00] out to battle and I got enough strength
[40:02] to come back David said in Psalms 1839
[40:06] for thou Hast guarded me with strength
[40:07] under the battle Psalms 273 and 26 My
[40:11] Flesh and my heart faileth but God is
[40:15] the strength of my heart and my portion
[40:18] forever come on somebody Psalms 28 and S
[40:22] the Lord is my strength and my shield my
[40:24] heart trusted in him and I am am
[40:28] held therefore my heart greatly
[40:30] rejoiceth and with my song will I Praise
[40:33] Him Paul said in 2 Corinthians 4:7 but
[40:37] we have this treasure in Earth and
[40:40] vessels that the Excellency of the power
[40:43] might be of God and not of
[40:49] us who come on problems I got your
[40:53] answer come on devil I got your answer
[40:57] come on turmoil I got
[40:59] chance come on somebody raise up your
[41:02] hand raise up your problems and tell
[41:05] them problems you can't stay when the
[41:08] answer's in the
[41:12] [Applause]
[41:13] way I'mma tell you what I'm somebody's
[41:16] going to have to hold my mule cuz I feel
[41:17] a
[41:20] shout
[41:22] hallelujah
[41:24] hallelujah when questions would arise
[41:27] to our
[41:30] Lord where'd you get this
[41:32] power Jesus had all the
[41:35] answers they began to ask him said by
[41:37] what Authority do you teach these things
[41:40] by what power are you saying these
[41:42] things and Jesus gave them a question to
[41:46] their question he said all right he said
[41:50] by the baptism of John was his baptism
[41:53] of man or was it of God and they knew
[41:56] they couldn't answer answer him on those
[41:57] things they knew they couldn't answer
[41:59] him but Jesus said neither am I going to
[42:01] answer you anymore and the prophet said
[42:04] in God's only provided place he said
[42:06] they was trying to figure it out he said
[42:08] but it was none of their business he had
[42:11] he had a work to do and he finished it
[42:14] he said God help us to do the same thing
[42:17] you don't have to answer the devil's
[42:21] questions come on fear I don't have to
[42:24] answer your questions come on down I
[42:27] don't have to answer your questions come
[42:29] on serpent seed I've got the
[42:34] answer what was it when Jesus stood
[42:37] there they could not understand this but
[42:39] he was literally the answer to all of
[42:42] the prophets prophecies that everything
[42:45] that was laid there all the way back
[42:47] from the Garden of Eden that there would
[42:50] be a seed that would raise up and would
[42:52] bruise the head of the serpent he was
[42:56] that answer
[43:00] now some of you've been praying and
[43:02] you've been asking for an answer but
[43:04] could you imagine waiting thousands of
[43:07] years come on Isaiah where you at wait
[43:09] 800 years for the
[43:11] answer come on Abraham can you can you
[43:14] wait 25 years for the
[43:17] answer now notice what he speaks to them
[43:19] in John chapter 10 and 24 then came the
[43:22] Jews round about him said unto him how
[43:24] long does thou make us to doubt if thou
[43:27] be the Christ tell us plainly I love
[43:30] this and Jesus answered them and said I
[43:33] told
[43:35] you come on you big dummies I told
[43:41] you I told you and you believe me
[43:46] not it's like it's like when Mama God
[43:50] bless Mama it's like when Mama
[43:52] straightened me out whoop my rear
[43:55] end and ask her do you love me she said
[43:57] I showed you I loved
[44:02] you some of y'all get that
[44:05] today I told you but you believe me not
[44:09] the works that I do in my father's name
[44:12] they bear witness of me so the works was
[44:16] the answer but when Jesus comes down a
[44:19] little bit further and said I my father
[44:20] one they couldn't handle the answer they
[44:22] couldn't handle they couldn't handle the
[44:24] pressure of him and the word being the
[44:26] same thing they could not figure that
[44:28] out how that Moses got that law up there
[44:30] on Mount SII and he says I am that law
[44:33] he could not figure out how that he said
[44:35] I am that I am he could not figure that
[44:37] out they were standing there with some
[44:39] of the greatest minds but they had zero
[44:42] understanding by the prophecy of who
[44:45] they were of who he
[44:47] was and they simply turned on him and
[44:49] said you're blaspheming the Holy Ghost
[44:53] he said but it is it is it not written
[44:56] that I said unto you you or that you are
[45:00] God's you see he wasn't just taking them
[45:02] to where he was he was taking them all
[45:04] the way back to the Garden of Eden and
[45:06] said right there is your answer that
[45:09] Adam was a god back there under amateur
[45:12] form he was a God when he moved the
[45:14] mountains he was a God when he spoke to
[45:17] the wind he was a God when he named the
[45:19] tiger he was a God when he named The
[45:22] Lion I'll say what you are when you
[45:25] cause cancer to be defeated Sals you are
[45:28] acting like a Son of
[45:34] God it was the answer to it they
[45:37] couldn't understand they could not
[45:39] understand this how that this mortal
[45:43] flesh had this much power even the
[45:46] people that walked with him that that
[45:48] had rode on the boat with him that had
[45:50] fish with him that had took up tithes
[45:53] with him that had fed the 5,000 with him
[45:56] they couldn't even understand where he
[45:58] got that power when he stood out there
[46:00] on that water said is that a ghost out
[46:01] there walking they said how does this
[46:04] man have power to control the winds and
[46:06] the waves they couldn't understand it
[46:08] this was a new thing for them it was a
[46:12] new thing for them but you see he was
[46:15] the answer to all of it he was the
[46:18] answer to
[46:19] legion's understanding because Legion
[46:22] was a good man I'm not going into that
[46:23] full story but Legion was a man where
[46:26] the Prophet would say say that every
[46:27] once in a while he would come to himself
[46:30] and the prophet would use this he would
[46:33] use this terminology when he was
[46:34] referring to Christ in some ways he
[46:36] would say that he was a dual person that
[46:39] Christ was a dual person and it's
[46:41] amazing it's amazing how close that
[46:44] Satan gets how close he gets brother
[46:47] bisco would call it a Razor's Edge of
[46:49] how close that the devil can get that it
[46:52] could be that close you look at somebody
[46:55] that's got a chemical imbalance in their
[46:56] body when they begin to get bipolar and
[46:59] they they get in it's amazing how close
[47:02] that that is to being like you and God
[47:07] it's amazing but Jesus said I and my
[47:09] father are one and he simply said un
[47:13] them he simply said unto them you are
[47:15] Gods brother Brandon picked that up he
[47:18] said the principle is God in the
[47:21] people the principle is God in the
[47:25] people you see what you have are
[47:27] experiencing is not a chemical imbalance
[47:30] what you're experiencing is not a
[47:32] bipolar condition that one day you're
[47:34] God and the next day you're not but
[47:37] you're literally under the principal
[47:39] theme of Christ the mystery God revealed
[47:43] that it's Christ in you the hope of
[47:46] glory this ain't some chemical imbalance
[47:49] this ain't some bipolar disorder this is
[47:52] a nature change it's a birth it's a
[47:55] Pentecostal experience
[47:59] brother Brandon would I love the way
[48:01] that he would describe it like this he
[48:02] said he had he had that man that come by
[48:04] his house one day knocked on his door he
[48:06] said he was a Drifter and brother bam
[48:08] said he had no ambition about where he
[48:10] was going in life he just simply went
[48:11] from this play place to that place and
[48:14] he simply asked himself how long where
[48:15] do you where where do you call home he
[48:17] said wherever my hat is and brother ROM
[48:19] would identify that man to drift wood
[48:21] that gets caught up in the
[48:23] river you've heard the story that he
[48:26] would he would identify that man he said
[48:28] a man without Ambitions like that
[48:29] Driftwood that gets caught up in the
[48:31] turns of the river you see he said it
[48:34] gets caught up in the trash of the world
[48:37] and it stays right there in that corner
[48:40] he said but you take a boat that's made
[48:41] out of wood and you let it drift down
[48:44] there in the trash get down there in the
[48:46] turns of life he said what is it he said
[48:49] the difference is is that boat is
[48:52] crafted by a master and it's Guided by a
[48:54] master and it's got a power by behind it
[48:57] to get itself out of the turns or out of
[49:00] the trash of life let me say it like
[49:02] this you may have looked like you were
[49:04] trash you may look like Driftwood but
[49:07] there's a power there's a principal
[49:10] theme behind your life come on somebody
[49:14] the devil may have turned you around the
[49:16] devil may have put you in some real
[49:17] trash but it's a different story now
[49:21] there's a power to get you
[49:24] out of the trash out of the
[49:29] situation Hallelujah you couldn't got
[49:32] yourself out of that mess but the
[49:34] prophet said that Jesus was opening a
[49:38] gate or a door to the sons of God that
[49:41] they could be like him he was liter he
[49:45] was literally opening up a
[49:48] gate I only put know how to put it in
[49:50] Farmers terms in Farmers
[49:53] terms you got you got that fresh cut hay
[49:57] and you got them hungry cattle on that
[50:00] side of the fence you just open the gate
[50:02] one good time and you you'll create a
[50:05] stampede because they feel
[50:07] Hallelujah I feel I kind of feel like
[50:10] that little calf been shut up all win
[50:12] long he gets a smell of that hay get out
[50:15] of his
[50:17] way what was the prophet saying is that
[50:19] God was opening a gate to the sons of
[50:23] God
[50:28] come on in come on in here come on over
[50:32] here maybe they think you can't have the
[50:34] Holy Ghost but come on in here maybe
[50:37] they don't think you can create apple
[50:38] trees but come on in here maybe they
[50:41] think you can't create squirrels but
[50:43] come on in
[50:46] here
[50:48] hallelujah what is it it's bride time
[50:51] it's Malachi 4 time it's manifesting
[50:54] time we have the the answer to the
[50:58] devil's
[51:03] question literally living in the
[51:06] hour of the Turning of the Heart by the
[51:11] preaching of the word it unveils the
[51:13] hearts and Faith begins to turn what is
[51:17] it brother Brandon would say that he
[51:19] literally sent a prophetic gift in this
[51:22] hour to stimulate the faith of the
[51:24] Believers
[51:27] if you ain't you're never going to get
[51:28] anything from God unless you believe him
[51:31] brother Brandon would come to prayer
[51:32] line after prayer line and he would
[51:33] stand there and he would tell the people
[51:35] now look if you're not a Believer and
[51:38] you ain't got faith to believe it would
[51:39] be better for you to get out of this
[51:41] line than to stay in this
[51:43] line to come through it you'd be he said
[51:46] if you come through here as a doubter he
[51:48] said you would leave off better off
[51:51] better worse than what you came in here
[51:54] if you're doubter now he wasn't talking
[51:55] about he wasn't talking about immoral
[51:57] acts he wasn't talking about attributes
[51:59] of it because there were all kinds of
[52:01] immoral acts there were all kinds of
[52:03] Dirty Deeds there were all kinds of just
[52:05] life that came through that line but he
[52:07] wasn't talking about the acts that you
[52:09] did as a sinner he was talking about
[52:12] your faith he was saying do not even
[52:14] enter this line unless you got faith to
[52:17] believe that the Lord's able to do
[52:19] something he was simply challenging the
[52:22] people's Faith to believe that all
[52:25] things were possible possible even Jesus
[52:28] would stand there when he was talking to
[52:30] Nicodemus in John 3:16 he in verse 18 he
[52:34] stood there and said he that believeth
[52:36] is not condemned but he that believeth
[52:40] not is condemned already what is he
[52:43] saying is a person that believes rolls
[52:46] away the condemnation but the person
[52:49] that
[52:50] disbelieves keeps the condemnation that
[52:53] they are under he said you don't send
[52:55] that God don't send you to hell it's you
[52:58] refusing the accepting power of the
[53:01] Salvation of Jesus Christ that sends you
[53:03] to
[53:05] Hell come on somebody God ain't sent one
[53:08] person to hell you or the sinner has
[53:11] sent himself to hell that's why the
[53:14] prophet would say it's a death it's a
[53:16] death stroke to Satan when a man takes
[53:18] God at his word it's the hardest punch
[53:22] that the devil can ever receive is when
[53:24] God finds a believer that really
[53:27] believes how many Believers are right in
[53:29] the
[53:31] building but you see all that Satan is
[53:33] wanting to do is simply plant the seed
[53:36] of doubt it's all he's want to do
[53:40] because if he plants it you end up
[53:42] watering that
[53:43] thing you end up watering that thing by
[53:46] going to church you end up watering that
[53:47] thing by worshiping that Spirit you end
[53:49] up watering that thing by by worshiping
[53:51] that disease all he wants to do is
[53:54] simply plant the seed of D doubt just
[53:56] just like when when Jesus is after Jesus
[53:59] had done raised on Easter morning and
[54:02] the chief priest and and all of them
[54:03] found out that Jesus's body was missing
[54:06] they that that the chief priest went to
[54:08] the soldiers and they they begin to
[54:10] confer and talk with them and they came
[54:12] up with a remedy and said we'll offer
[54:14] you all this money if you'll simply tell
[54:17] a lie that the disciples came in and
[54:20] took them while you was asleeping on a
[54:21] job and they came up with a lie but you
[54:25] see what the devil was doing and he was
[54:26] trying to create the art of
[54:29] confusion he was trying to confuse real
[54:34] Believers he was trying to confuse
[54:37] them it's kind of like somebody it's
[54:40] kind of like a a gallant man of this
[54:41] message when people were saying things
[54:44] about the message or bringing up all
[54:46] kinds of questions of what they thought
[54:47] the message was and what they thought
[54:49] the prophet really meant about that and
[54:51] they had this whole line of questions he
[54:53] a gallant man of the message he went up
[54:55] to him and said look them ain't my
[54:57] questions them are your questions he
[55:00] said because all of my questions got
[55:02] answered when I came to this message God
[55:05] is not the author of confusion God is
[55:08] the author of
[55:11] Faith they made my questions I know
[55:14] Hallelujah I know in whom I haveth
[55:16] believed come on somebody come on
[55:19] somebody maybe you don't understand
[55:21] everything maybe you don't see
[55:23] everything maybe you don't understand
[55:25] why or how you got to digest the word
[55:27] maybe maybe you just maybe you got
[55:29] simple questions that you literally need
[55:32] to figure out just to grow in a
[55:34] Christian
[55:35] walk it's a major difference in
[55:37] questioning the message and asking for a
[55:40] deeper
[55:42] Revelation because God gives that kind
[55:44] of
[55:46] understanding is that right and maybe
[55:49] you got a list maybe you got a list of
[55:51] questions maybe you're needing some
[55:53] answers in your life but let me put it
[55:55] to you
[55:57] like the good woman in Daniel chapter 5
[56:00] when the king belshazzar had had all
[56:03] these things when the handwriting was
[56:05] upon the wall and it was without
[56:07] understanding she said oh King live
[56:10] forever don't just start doubting your
[56:13] doubts because there's a man in the land
[56:16] that is known as the dissolver of
[56:21] doubts he understands the supernatural
[56:24] he understands what it takes to produce
[56:26] the
[56:28] Supernatural come on somebody he's got
[56:31] the answers to your
[56:34] questions let me say that the same one
[56:37] not William brandham but the same one
[56:39] that gave the answers at the pull pit is
[56:41] still here today and I'll say this to
[56:44] you he is the dissolver of
[56:48] doubts why don't you turn on your doubts
[56:51] and say I'm doubting my
[56:53] doubts maybe you got questions
[56:56] but I want to say this to you he's got
[56:59] answers maybe you got problems but he's
[57:02] got a
[57:04] solution come on somebody maybe you got
[57:07] sickness but he's got a
[57:09] cure it's a devil's job to cause
[57:14] questions but the message is the
[57:19] answer the message is the answer let me
[57:22] go a little bit further you're the
[57:25] answer
[57:27] you're the answer to the devil's
[57:32] question let me let me just let me just
[57:34] drop this right
[57:36] here when when I'm kind of in that
[57:40] channel so let me just let me just drop
[57:42] this right here is when when some things
[57:46] were happening around the ranks of the
[57:48] message when you had disbelieve the sign
[57:50] coming amongst us and all these things
[57:52] trying to bring up all kinds of
[57:54] questions about what the prophet was and
[57:56] what he really meant and all the all
[57:57] these kinds of debauchery kinds of
[58:00] Lies brother Matthew had to deal with
[58:02] some difficult things in his life and go
[58:05] through some real hurdles but he was he
[58:07] was given a he was given a list of
[58:10] scriptures from brother Donnie rean he
[58:12] was given a letter from brother Tim pu
[58:13] and given a letter from brother Ron
[58:15] Spencer and he basically walked into
[58:17] this camp and he he basically he
[58:19] basically just put put it down he just
[58:22] basically put down a law he was a man
[58:23] I'll tell you what Matthew's not the
[58:25] kind of guy that you want to tangle with
[58:26] in the spiritual or in the
[58:29] natural I know
[58:33] both glad them natural days are pass
[58:36] me but he literally walked in and walked
[58:39] back he walked back to a to a place
[58:41] walked back to a place and him and his
[58:43] wife was sitting there and he simply and
[58:45] I I forgive me but I'm just telling this
[58:47] story and I hope I ain't telling outside
[58:48] of school or telling something that I
[58:49] shouldn't be telling but I believe I got
[58:51] authority to tell
[58:52] it I'm his brother but he simply walked
[58:56] back to his wife and he said if William
[58:59] brandham is not Malachi 4 then this
[59:01] whole Bible's
[59:03] wrong and when he said that when he said
[59:06] that brother Ron the pillar of fire com
[59:09] sweeping into the room where they were
[59:11] and hung there in the room as a
[59:14] Vindication that this message thoroughly
[59:16] thoroughly Vindicated that William
[59:19] brandham was Malachi 4 and if you stand
[59:23] for this message then God will stand for
[59:25] you
[59:27] you let them raise their questions the
[59:31] pillar of fire is the
[59:33] answer that's why you can stand there
[59:36] and say I am the answer to the devil's
[59:41] question blessed be the name of the Lord
[59:44] I know it might Rock You just a little
[59:46] bit but that same power that was in
[59:49] Jesus that Rose him up on Easter morning
[59:52] is that same
[59:54] power Satan wondered if he was a Son of
[59:57] God but Easter morning proved he was
[1:00:00] both mechanics and
[1:00:02] Dynamics that's what this message has
[1:00:04] done in this hour it's proving that you
[1:00:07] are beneficiaries of the
[1:00:11] Resurrection Hallelujah it ain't just
[1:00:14] mechanical to you you know the Dynamics
[1:00:16] of
[1:00:18] it somebody give the Lord a hand clap of
[1:00:21] Praise tell your neighbor I am the
[1:00:24] answer to the Devil's
[1:00:27] [Applause]
[1:00:32] question
[1:00:36] [Applause]
[1:00:39] hallelujah hallelujah you begin to study
[1:00:42] out that he's a dissolver of
[1:00:45] doubts you'll find when you start
[1:00:47] studying in the Hebrew that you'll find
[1:00:50] that the same word is used in Daniel
[1:00:54] chapter 2 of shirar the word in the
[1:00:57] Hebrew
[1:00:58] Shar it means to dissolve it means to
[1:01:02] unravel it means to dwell and when
[1:01:06] Daniel is standing there when
[1:01:08] Nebuchadnezzar has a dream and he brings
[1:01:10] his dream he brings us up before his
[1:01:13] wise men and tells them you tell me my
[1:01:15] dream and they said you tell us your
[1:01:17] dream and we'll tell you what your dream
[1:01:19] means he said you either tell me what my
[1:01:21] dream is or I'm going to kill you but
[1:01:23] there was Rose up a man that was an
[1:01:26] excellent in his spirit that had defiled
[1:01:30] himself not with the king's meat or the
[1:01:32] king's drink and he simply stood there
[1:01:36] and he brought a revelation of what the
[1:01:38] King's dream was what did he do Daniel
[1:01:42] went back and recovered the
[1:01:44] dream when you start studying out Daniel
[1:01:47] chapter 2 and verse 22 you'll find that
[1:01:51] there he begins to say that he is the
[1:01:54] desol he begins to say that he knoweth
[1:01:57] or he revealeth the deep and secret
[1:01:59] things he knoweth what is in darkness
[1:02:01] and the
[1:02:02] light dissolve with him the light
[1:02:06] dwelleth with him the light
[1:02:10] unravels the light
[1:02:13] unravels with him the light literally
[1:02:17] the Revelation begins to loose
[1:02:20] you sometimes you don't even know that
[1:02:22] you're loose but he literally the
[1:02:24] revelation of it looses you it's just
[1:02:27] like the woman that was caught in ulry
[1:02:29] she never lifted her
[1:02:32] head she never lifted her head but when
[1:02:35] Jesus was standing there he said woman
[1:02:38] where art thine accusers she didn't have
[1:02:41] the Revelation yet that the man that was
[1:02:44] standing there before her was the one
[1:02:47] that loosed her from her
[1:02:49] accusers what is it he is the same one
[1:02:53] that was standing before lazarus's grave
[1:02:55] he was a du Hallelujah he was a dual
[1:02:59] nature human being he was a dual being
[1:03:02] he was both man and he was both God he
[1:03:05] wept like a man he ate like a man he
[1:03:08] cried like a man he died like a man but
[1:03:11] he rose like a god he spoke Lazarus come
[1:03:14] forth like a god he said peace be still
[1:03:18] like a
[1:03:19] [Applause]
[1:03:20] god come on somebody when William
[1:03:23] brandham spoke those squirrels into
[1:03:25] existence he never said in the name of
[1:03:28] Jesus Christ he said let there
[1:03:31] be what was it it was a sign that the
[1:03:34] same son of man had come back in body
[1:03:36] form

[1:08:34] in line for it open the gate you're in
[1:08:37] line for
[1:08:39] it brother Bram goes that little story
[1:08:41] about Johnny Crow where somebody took
[1:08:43] that little crow and tied him up to that
[1:08:45] tied him up to that place Little Johnny
[1:08:48] Crow had built up an understanding that
[1:08:50] was as far as he could go that's as far
[1:08:52] as he could live out but he said there
[1:08:54] was a good man that came by Johnny Crow
[1:08:57] and un loosed him and let him go but
[1:09:00] Johnny Crow stood right there in that
[1:09:02] place and he kept walking around the
[1:09:04] same spot because Johnny Crow didn't
[1:09:07] have an understanding that he was
[1:09:14] free he goes back to the
[1:09:17] question will you lay your hands upon me
[1:09:19] and free me from
[1:09:23] that he said here this
[1:09:26] sister dear or brother dear
[1:09:29] sure I'd lay hands on you but that
[1:09:32] wouldn't free
[1:09:35] you what would free you is for you to
[1:09:40] understand that you're already free
[1:09:42] you're already untied you don't have to
[1:09:44] worry about being free you're already
[1:09:47] free Jesus made you free be not again
[1:09:50] entangled again in the Yoke of bondage
[1:09:53] you're as free as you can be you don't
[1:09:56] have to be tangled up the message
[1:09:59] literally unraveled your
[1:10:02] life you had questions do I move here do
[1:10:05] I keep this job do I do this or do I do
[1:10:08] that but the message turned the light
[1:10:13] on and he showed you what the answer was
[1:10:17] he literally LED
[1:10:22] you is it possible
[1:10:25] is it possible to be free is it possible
[1:10:29] to have that kind of understanding it
[1:10:32] sure is because the prophet said that
[1:10:35] you're Justified as if you never done it
[1:10:37] in the first place God is not looking at
[1:10:40] you through your problems
[1:10:43] he's he's looking at the
[1:10:51] answer Hallelujah you know that it was
[1:10:54] not a man you know you didn't move here
[1:10:57] you know that you didn't move out of
[1:10:59] your altar you you didn't move out of
[1:11:00] your Pew for some man-made emotion you
[1:11:03] moved out because the spirit of God was
[1:11:05] leading you
[1:11:09] out come on somebody this ain't some man
[1:11:14] move this is the answer to the devil's
[1:11:16] question but this ain't some emotional
[1:11:19] workup because Devils have got that but
[1:11:22] this is literally the headship oh over
[1:11:25] the
[1:11:26] body that's why Paul would say in
[1:11:29] Galatians 2 and 20 yet not I but Christ
[1:11:32] that lives within me he hath redeemed me
[1:11:36] he hath restored me he have set me in
[1:11:38] this
[1:11:41] place I read a story this
[1:11:44] week read a story about this this man
[1:11:47] that was sitting in DC he sat in DC and
[1:11:50] it was a soldier as a soldier in Civil
[1:11:53] War times he's sitting outside the White
[1:11:54] House and his sitting there looking at
[1:11:56] it the soldier was just he's literally
[1:11:59] balling his eyes out the soldier had had
[1:12:03] lost two of his brothers in the war he
[1:12:06] lost two of his brothers in the war and
[1:12:08] he was wanting to talk to the president
[1:12:11] because his family was without somebody
[1:12:13] that could work the farm so he wanted to
[1:12:15] talk to the
[1:12:18] president this little boy come up to him
[1:12:20] and said sir what are you crying about
[1:12:24] he said
[1:12:25] he said I'm trying to see the president
[1:12:27] he said but it's real hard to get in
[1:12:28] there said I can't they won't let me see
[1:12:31] him he said yeah you're right he said it
[1:12:33] is real hard he said it is real hard to
[1:12:35] get in there and see him he said he said
[1:12:38] maybe come with me real
[1:12:39] quick so the soldier starts following
[1:12:42] this little boy starts following this
[1:12:44] little boy and he he walks past the
[1:12:46] first guards and the guards don't say
[1:12:48] nothing to him and he just walks right
[1:12:50] in walks in past the second guard and
[1:12:53] just walks right on in now they don't
[1:12:55] say nothing to him he goes through the
[1:12:57] front doors and there's guards there
[1:12:59] they don't say nothing to him and he
[1:13:00] just keeps walking in and before long
[1:13:02] he's standing in the Oval
[1:13:05] Office and the president at that time
[1:13:07] was Abraham Lincoln and he looks up he
[1:13:09] said hey son who you got
[1:13:14] there it was Abraham's son Tad Lincoln
[1:13:18] that had took this Soldier and had led
[1:13:20] him in to the White House so it matters
[1:13:23] who's leading you
[1:13:25] it matters who's leading you and I want
[1:13:27] to say this to you it matters when the
[1:13:29] message of the hour it's ain't some fly
[1:13:32] night school message it ain't some
[1:13:34] ideology this is a message of the hour
[1:13:37] it matters who's leading you if a little
[1:13:39] bitty boy could lead a little little
[1:13:41] soldier into the president
[1:13:46] Hall how much more as the authority as a
[1:13:50] preacher of this gospel have I got
[1:13:52] Liberty to lead you right into your
[1:13:54] healing lead you right into your
[1:13:58] [Applause]

[1:14:39] these things all of these all of these
[1:14:42] instruments or these these dynamics of
[1:14:44] life there's somebody literally leading
[1:14:47] all the
[1:14:48] details and we don't just call Brother
[1:14:51] Ron's name as as just to lift a man up
[1:14:53] but we call it as a witness that there
[1:14:57] is somebody leading the events of a
[1:15:00] person's life that even though they go
[1:15:02] through questions even though they go
[1:15:03] through tribulations even though they go
[1:15:05] through trials Jesus said in this world
[1:15:08] you will have tribulations but in me you
[1:15:11] will have peace I have great cheer be of
[1:15:14] good cheer I have overcome the world
[1:15:16] there is somebody that is not leading
[1:15:18] you to tribulation but is leading you to
[1:15:23] peace brother Ron come out of that took
[1:15:27] him a long time to get back in the pole
[1:15:28] pit you remember I I remember going deer
[1:15:31] hunting with him I remember him trying
[1:15:33] to just get out of the truck and walk 15
[1:15:36] 20 yards and sit down and go sit down
[1:15:39] and trying to hunt because he wanted to
[1:15:41] be with his boys he'd been robbed from
[1:15:43] some things and he wanted to be with us
[1:15:44] and brother Thomas we we'd go over to a
[1:15:46] certain spot and we'd sit down and and I
[1:15:48] remember being with him he was coughing
[1:15:50] all the way through hunting season he
[1:15:51] coughed through the pull pit he coughed
[1:15:53] through preaching and
[1:15:57] but God is the leader of all the
[1:16:01] details and he was led to go down to
[1:16:05] Ruth North Carolina and there was a man
[1:16:08] of God standing there by the name of
[1:16:10] Eddie bisc that was standing there and
[1:16:11] it was preaching a message on the order
[1:16:14] bringing order to
[1:16:17] chaos and I'd like to share something
[1:16:19] with you
[1:16:31] exactly what you stood up
[1:16:36] for the prophet had people reach reach
[1:16:39] over and touch someone else lay hand on
[1:16:42] someone else they to lay hands on one
[1:16:44] another hey you know what he said deity
[1:16:48] is not in
[1:16:49] heaven D in you does this audience
[1:16:53] believe that
[1:16:55] then let deity reach out with compassion
[1:16:59] and touch someone else's shoulder and
[1:17:01] say in the name of Jesus Christ I'm
[1:17:03] standing with this brother I'm standing
[1:17:05] with this sister let's just pray
[1:17:07] together Heavenly Father this is your
[1:17:11] commission this is the this is your Holy

[1:17:16] Bride of Jesus Christ The Bride of Jesus
[1:17:19] Christ is calling for deliverance is
[1:17:23] calling for healing is calling for these
[1:17:26] cells oh God to be corrected to for this
[1:17:29] disorder to come into
[1:17:35] order that is a very
[1:17:37] moment that your pastor was standing in
[1:17:40] that building and he stood to his feet
[1:17:43] and an oxygen tent come over top of
[1:17:45] brother Ron and he never struggled with
[1:17:48] his lungs one day from that moment what
[1:17:51] was it it was sale on top of sale on top
[1:17:54] of sale
[1:18:00] what was it order was brought to the
[1:18:03] chaos in brother Ron's life it is this
[1:18:07] same message that has sold you that
[1:18:10] deity is not in heaven but deity is in
[1:18:13] you he's the same God brother Ron to
[1:18:16] bring order to the chaos of your
[1:18:19] life he is the same God in this building
[1:18:23] right now
[1:18:25] why don't you unravel the shackles off
[1:18:28] of your understanding unravel jealousy
[1:18:31] unravel your pride unravel
[1:18:35] yourself when you can unravel and shake
[1:18:38] the shackles off of your understanding
[1:18:40] the prophet said that the Holy Spirit
[1:18:42] could perform a miracle again and you
[1:18:46] then have the moment and have the
[1:18:48] authority to say I am free I am healed I
[1:18:51] am delivered I have the power of God I
[1:18:54] am a gene seed of God I am the image of

[1:19:31] to a man standing it didn't matter who
[1:19:34] laid his hands on on this one and who
[1:19:36] laid their hands on that one What
[1:19:39] mattered was the
[1:19:42] results what happened to that woman up
[1:19:44] there that had that sick baby in that
[1:19:46] balcony when that Mama had something on
