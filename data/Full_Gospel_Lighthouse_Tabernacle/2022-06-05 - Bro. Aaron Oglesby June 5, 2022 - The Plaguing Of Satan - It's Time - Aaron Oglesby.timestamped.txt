[47:17] exodus 2
[47:19] verse 23
[47:23] it says here and it came to pass
[47:26] in process of time it's going to be
[47:29] something we look at a lot today the
[47:31] process of time
[47:32] that the king of egypt died and the
[47:34] children of israel's side by reason of
[47:36] the bondage and they cried and their cry
[47:39] came up unto god by reason of the
[47:42] bondage
[47:43] and god heard their groaning and god
[47:45] remembered his covenant with abraham
[47:47] with isaac
[47:49] and with jacob we're going to go down
[47:51] now to chapter 11 in exodus chapter 11
[47:54] verse 1.
[48:02] and the lord said unto moses yet will i
[48:05] bring one plague more upon pharaoh and
[48:08] upon egypt
[48:09] afterwards he will let you go hence
[48:12] when he shall let you go he shall surely
[48:15] thrust you out hence
[48:17] all together amen you may have your
[48:20] seats this morning we ask that the lord
[48:21] would add his blessings
[48:23] to the reading of his word we're going
[48:24] to turn over now to mark
[48:26] the fifth chapter and the first verse
[48:29] and we're going to read a couple
[48:30] portions of scripture here mark 5 and 1
[48:33] says and they came over onto the other
[48:34] side of the sea
[48:36] into the country of the gadarenes and
[48:39] when he was come out of the ship
[48:40] immediately there met him out of the
[48:42] tombs of man with an unclean spirit
[48:45] who had his dwelling among the tombs and
[48:48] no man could bind him no not with chains
[48:52] because that he had been often bound
[48:54] with fetters and chains and the chains
[48:56] had been plucked asunder by him and the
[48:59] fetters broken in pieces neither could
[49:01] any man tame him
[49:03] and always night and day he was in the
[49:06] mountains and in the tombs crying and
[49:08] cutting himself with stones
[49:10] but when he saw jesus afar off he ran
[49:13] and worshiped him and cried with a loud
[49:16] voice and said what have i to do with
[49:20] thee jesus thou son of the most high god
[49:23] i adjure thee by god that thou torment
[49:27] me not
[49:29] for he said unto him come out of the man
[49:31] thou unclean spirit
[49:33] and he asked him what is thy name and he
[49:36] answered saying my name is legion for we
[49:38] are many and he besought him much that
[49:41] he would not send them away
[49:43] out of the country one thing that stood
[49:46] out to me as i read this is it said that
[49:48] no man
[49:49] combined him and that was the problem
[49:52] all along is all these people wanted to
[49:54] bind him but jesus wanted to set him
[49:56] free
[49:57] and the problem he didn't need binding
[49:59] he needed loosen
[50:01] and jesus come to do just that we're
[50:03] going to look one more portion matthew 8
[50:05] and 29 it says and behold they cried out
[50:07] saying what have we to do with thee
[50:09] jesus thou son of god art thou come
[50:12] hither to torment us
[50:15] before the time
[50:17] and there was a good way off from them a
[50:18] herd of swine feeding so the devils
[50:20] besought him saying if thou cast us out
[50:23] suffer us to go away into the herd of
[50:27] swine what i want to speak to you for a
[50:30] little bit today on is the plaguing of
[50:33] satan
[50:34] the plaguing of satan
[50:36] it's time
[50:37] amen it's time for us to to to turn the
[50:40] tables on the devil as it were what we
[50:43] know as we read through the scripture is
[50:45] that god's timing is perfect
[50:48] god is not a god of time however he is a
[50:51] god of perfect timing all right we we
[50:54] are as humans we are time beings and we
[50:56] become anxious and we expect things to
[50:59] happen at a certain time and yet our god
[51:02] doesn't operate in in that manner he
[51:04] doesn't have feelings of what when
[51:07] when is this going to happen he doesn't
[51:09] have those feelings he doesn't have
[51:10] feelings of how he doesn't have feelings
[51:13] of what if
[51:14] why is that why can god operate like
[51:16] that is because he is eternal and he
[51:19] already knows the end from the beginning
[51:21] he knew each and every one of you that
[51:23] would be sitting here today he knew
[51:26] where you would sit he knew what kind of
[51:28] troubles you would have this morning get
[51:30] into the house of god he saw the
[51:33] troubles and the straws and the little
[51:34] fusses and all that he knew all of that
[51:36] none of those things snuck up on him
[51:38] this morning and not only did he know
[51:40] you would be here he knew exactly what
[51:44] you would have need of from this service
[51:46] today aren't you glad today that there's
[51:48] nothing that sneaks up on god there's no
[51:50] situation where he goes oh no what do i
[51:53] do now he's already provided exactly
[51:56] what it is you have need of for your
[51:58] life today he is jehovah jireh he is our
[52:02] provider so so god isn't worried today
[52:05] because he knows the how he knows why
[52:08] and he knows when the when question with
[52:11] god is already settled it's already
[52:14] taken care of it's not a debate there's
[52:15] no worry there's no anxiety because
[52:18] there are special
[52:19] appointed
[52:21] predestinated times for all things
[52:24] it's already been set aside we as
[52:27] individuals have certain appointments
[52:30] with god for the things that we have
[52:32] need of in our lives and that moment is
[52:35] already set
[52:37] genesis 18 14 is there any to anything
[52:40] too hard for the lord at the time
[52:42] appointed i will return unto thee exodus
[52:46] 9 5 and the lord appointed a set time
[52:50] acts acts 7 17 but when the time of the
[52:54] promise drew not
[52:56] so if you'll notice all these things
[52:57] were already predestinated
[53:00] set times that god already knew when it
[53:02] was going to happen so there was no
[53:04] worry in him of when
[53:06] when is this going to take place and
[53:08] look these exact same things
[53:10] apply to your life as an individual
[53:12] there was a time that this message was
[53:14] going to cross your path
[53:16] there was a moment in time where you
[53:19] were going to give your life to jesus it
[53:21] was time
[53:22] and if you haven't done that yet let me
[53:24] say it's time
[53:26] it's time today to give your heart to
[53:28] the lord he's here today calling you
[53:30] there was a time in your life where you
[53:32] were going to receive the baptism of the
[53:34] holy ghost it was time it had reached
[53:37] the appointed time there's a moment
[53:40] where you're healing that you've been
[53:42] holding on to becomes materialized and
[53:45] you step into it it's time for for the
[53:48] for the fulfillment of that promise
[53:51] and god's timing once again is perfect
[53:54] timing
[53:56] when it becomes time for something to
[53:58] happen that god has set in order there
[54:00] is absolutely nothing that is going to
[54:03] stop it because according to god it's
[54:06] time not i feel like it's time i've been
[54:09] holding on his time is time but when it
[54:11] reaches the time there is nothing no
[54:14] devil no demon of hell that is gonna
[54:17] stop what is time to happen in your life
[54:21] it doesn't matter how much he fights it
[54:23] doesn't matter how much he hinders it
[54:24] doesn't matter the struggle when it's
[54:26] time for your deliverance he cannot stop
[54:29] you i say it's time this morning i say
[54:32] it's time for us to turn the tables on
[54:34] the enemy this morning
[54:36] when the time of the promise draws nigh
[54:39] when the time of fulfillment draws nigh
[54:42] i want to encourage you this morning
[54:43] that whatever it is you've been holding
[54:45] on for for the return of your child for
[54:48] the birth of a child for the baptism of
[54:50] the holy ghost for your healing i say
[54:53] don't let go now the time of the promise
[54:55] has drawn now it's time for fulfillment
[54:58] don't let go of the promise now when
[55:00] we're right at the doorstep of
[55:02] fulfillment
[55:03] the woman at the well had her time
[55:06] the devil had done everything he could
[55:08] do he had covered her up in sin and
[55:10] trespassed and filth to where she
[55:12] couldn't even hang out with other people
[55:14] he tried to keep her away from the well
[55:16] that day he knew where jesus was he
[55:19] tried to keep her there he tried to send
[55:21] her down this road he tried to cause
[55:23] this distraction but he couldn't stop
[55:25] her it was time it was time for her to
[55:28] be at the well there was a set time mary
[55:31] magdalene there was a time for her
[55:33] deliverance there was a moment and i say
[55:36] today it's time we step into our moment
[55:39] it's time we recognize and we play the
[55:41] part it's time this morning
[55:47] it was time for her to meet jesus
[55:49] and because of that their time running
[55:52] her life was over
[55:54] their time was finished
[55:57] [Music]
[55:59] it's time
[56:05] i believe there are seasons for
[56:06] everything
[56:07] i believe that god lays things on
[56:09] ministers hearts for a reason i believe
[56:12] that certain ministers come by certain
[56:13] places in a certain time for a certain
[56:16] reason i believe it's time this morning
[56:19] i believe he showed up here this weekend
[56:21] because it's your time for what it is
[56:23] that you have need of not i showed up
[56:25] here this weekend i don't amount to a
[56:26] hill of beans but when he shows up when
[56:29] he comes in the place that's all it look
[56:31] one moment in the presence of the angel
[56:33] one moment in the presence of god it
[56:35] changes everything forever all you need
[56:38] is a moment all you need is your time
[56:40] all you got to do is recognize today
[56:42] it's my time it's my moment and i'm
[56:45] gonna grab a hold to it
[56:47] it's time this morning for your healing
[56:49] it's time for those things you've been
[56:51] holding back for you to surrender and
[56:52] lay those things down
[56:54] it's time to lay down your hurts
[56:56] it's time to move on beyond those scars
[56:59] and those things that's held you back
[57:00] from being the christian that you know
[57:02] you ought to be or that god's calling
[57:04] you to it's time today to move on
[57:07] and when the time has come satan can do
[57:10] nothing to stop it in the scripture we
[57:12] read it was exodus time
[57:15] it was time for the deliverer to show up
[57:17] the promise the time of the promise had
[57:19] drawn nigh and it did not matter what
[57:21] pharaoh put on the people it did not
[57:24] matter what pharaoh tried to do it was
[57:26] time for the exodus and there was
[57:28] nothing that pharaoh could do to stop it
[57:30] i say we've reached rapture time it's
[57:32] going home time it's time for the
[57:35] fulfillment of all things and there's
[57:37] nothing the devil can do to stop it
[57:43] there is perfect timing for everything
[57:46] our god is always working
[57:49] the word would tell us that he is never
[57:50] slack concerning his promises
[57:53] he is going to fulfill all that he has
[57:55] promised
[57:56] we see there in the book of isaiah
[57:58] chapter 7
[58:00] that he said behold a virgin shall
[58:02] conceive
[58:03] and that would lay dormant there in the
[58:05] scripture for 700 years
[58:08] just laying there
[58:10] well when's it going to happen when's it
[58:11] going to happen at the predestinated
[58:14] time
[58:15] at the time set aside by almighty god
[58:18] but there did come a time
[58:21] of fulfillment
[58:23] there came a day that there was a little
[58:24] virgin who was willing to step into that
[58:27] and when the when the angel appeared to
[58:29] her she didn't go well no i can't do
[58:31] that surely she said be it unto me lord
[58:34] according to the promise she was willing
[58:37] to step in and play her part
[58:39] just as we spoke about last night there
[58:40] was a deliverer promised there in the
[58:42] beginning in every type and every shadow
[58:44] pointed to it but there came a time of
[58:47] fulfillment
[58:49] man had lost everything and the law that
[58:51] the man had asked for had failed they
[58:53] had not been able to keep it but it was
[58:55] time for a promised redeemer
[58:57] and then he comes and he gives his life
[58:59] there on calvary he goes down to hell he
[59:02] rises again he sends back the baptism of
[59:04] the holy ghost what for
[59:06] what were all these things for it was
[59:08] happening because it was time for the
[59:10] fulfillment of all things there in the
[59:12] old testament he fulfilled all of it
[59:16] it was time that adam's race who had
[59:19] lost everything would now have
[59:20] everything returned back to them
[59:23] in waters of separation brother branham
[59:25] says and when christ came to become man
[59:27] here on earth and be a kinsmen redeemer
[59:30] he redeemed man back to everything he
[59:33] lost in the fall
[59:34] christ restored it to him in the kinsman
[59:36] redeemership when he died at calvary
[59:39] your health your eternal life everything
[59:42] that you lost in the fall christ redeems
[59:44] you to it for he's your kinsmen redeemer
[59:48] your health your strength and everything
[59:50] belongs back to you tonight through the
[59:52] lord jesus he become kinfolk to take
[59:55] away sin and sickness
[59:58] everything the human race lost in adam
[1:00:00] was redeemed when christ god himself
[1:00:03] became kinfolk with the human race
[1:00:05] redeemed it back to his maker all that
[1:00:08] was lost he redeemed back again
[1:00:12] he goes on to say all things are
[1:00:13] possible to them that believe we've got
[1:00:16] the untapped resources of god at our
[1:00:18] hands to display god we are sons and
[1:00:22] daughters of god when god made man he
[1:00:25] made him a god
[1:00:28] he gave him dominion over the earth but
[1:00:30] his fallen estate dropped that but when
[1:00:32] they lost by adam it was restored by
[1:00:35] christ he said if you you say to this
[1:00:38] mountain be moved and don't doubt in
[1:00:40] your heart but believe that what you
[1:00:42] said shall come to pass you can have
[1:00:44] what you said all things whatsoever you
[1:00:47] desire when you pray believe you receive
[1:00:50] it you shall have it amen he restored to
[1:00:53] us all that was lost in adam god is
[1:00:57] depending
[1:00:58] on us
[1:01:01] one more
[1:01:03] he was the first one who made who had
[1:01:05] jurisdiction over everything in the
[1:01:06] earth over all animals he lost his power
[1:01:10] and we're taught in the bible that what
[1:01:12] the first adam lost the second adam
[1:01:14] christ restored again to the human race
[1:01:16] then friends if that's so
[1:01:19] ministers what's the matter with the
[1:01:21] church today
[1:01:22] that's what i want to know
[1:01:24] if christ was the missing link between
[1:01:26] god and man and he's come to hook god
[1:01:28] and man together again then what's the
[1:01:32] matter today
[1:01:34] he says it's because of unbelief
[1:01:37] it's because now why'd you read all that
[1:01:39] that that to us brother aaron i just
[1:01:41] want you to show that everything that
[1:01:42] was lost has been given back i want you
[1:01:45] to know that today you're sitting in a
[1:01:47] place where everything adam lost has
[1:01:49] been restored back to you again and you
[1:01:52] do have the right to speak you do have
[1:01:55] the right to stand on the word you do
[1:01:57] have the right to take the words of god
[1:01:59] and put it on your lips all was restored
[1:02:02] brother branham said that adam didn't
[1:02:04] operate the weed and he would speak to
[1:02:05] the tree and tell it to move he would
[1:02:07] speak just like the second adam and
[1:02:09] those things have been restored today to
[1:02:11] you to where you have the right to take
[1:02:14] it upon your lips and speak the word
[1:02:16] once again and i say this morning it's
[1:02:19] time that we begin to operate in that
[1:02:21] manner
[1:02:23] we know that that thing was those things
[1:02:25] were restored there at the cross but
[1:02:27] once again man allowed reason and doubt
[1:02:30] and unbelief to rob them
[1:02:33] of all that of all that authority
[1:02:35] and we go into the dark ages
[1:02:38] and there's a scripture that i will
[1:02:39] restore and i know i dealt with that
[1:02:41] last night but there came a time for the
[1:02:44] reformation to begin there came a time
[1:02:46] for justification under luther there
[1:02:49] came a time for justification under
[1:02:51] wesley there came a time for the
[1:02:53] restoration of the gifts there was a
[1:02:55] promise laying in the scriptures malachi
[1:02:57] 4 there came a time for the fulfillment
[1:03:00] of that and brother branham came on the
[1:03:02] scene and he stepped in there to that
[1:03:04] part and i would say he did an awesome
[1:03:06] job
[1:03:07] i would say that he fulfilled that well
[1:03:09] he ran his race well he delivered this
[1:03:12] message he dedicated his life for it but
[1:03:14] for what
[1:03:16] for what purpose
[1:03:18] for us to sit around and talk about what
[1:03:20] god used to do
[1:03:21] for us to let us sit on a shelf in the
[1:03:23] form of tapes and sit on there as a form
[1:03:25] of books and to talk about it and debate
[1:03:27] it no he sent the message so that you
[1:03:30] could be the message so that you can
[1:03:32] live the message so that you could put
[1:03:34] it in action not just sit around and
[1:03:37] talk but you take the third pull power
[1:03:40] and you operate it the third pool
[1:03:42] operating in men and women that have
[1:03:44] been restored back to the original
[1:03:47] third pull power in you
[1:03:50] we keep looking for the fulfillment of
[1:03:52] things as if we play no part in that
[1:03:54] fulfillment but it's time for you to
[1:03:57] play your part
[1:03:58] the message is so full of power
[1:04:01] and you have been given the authority to
[1:04:04] use it it's been put in your hands
[1:04:07] in my name they shall cast out devils be
[1:04:10] it unto me lord be it unto me today i
[1:04:14] will have a church without spot or
[1:04:15] wrinkle be it unto me lord let me play
[1:04:18] that part in that church the works that
[1:04:21] i do shall you do also
[1:04:24] be it unto me lord it's time that i step
[1:04:27] in and begin to play my part
[1:04:32] abraham and his seed
[1:04:35] jesus said
[1:04:36] does it not say in your own laws ye or
[1:04:39] gods
[1:04:40] why do you condemn me then
[1:04:43] if your own law says you're god's
[1:04:45] he was given a domain the domain was the
[1:04:48] earth the whole earth is groaning
[1:04:50] waiting now for the manifestation of the
[1:04:52] sons of god if i'm a branham i'm a
[1:04:55] branham i'm part of a branham and if a
[1:04:58] man is a son of god he's made in the
[1:05:00] image of god given the domain here on
[1:05:03] earth to rule this earth like god ruled
[1:05:05] it
[1:05:06] and if the second adam proved it amen he
[1:05:08] stopped nature peace be still amen
[1:05:11] cursed the fig tree certainly he was a
[1:05:14] man yet he was god he was a manifested
[1:05:16] son of god that's what we're to be one
[1:05:19] of these days
[1:05:23] i say it's time
[1:05:25] i say it's time that we take these
[1:05:27] things off the page and we take these
[1:05:29] things and we begin to live them out we
[1:05:31] begin to operate in what we've been
[1:05:32] called to operate in god once again in
[1:05:36] flesh
[1:05:37] god once again in his bride once again
[1:05:41] somebody on the earth saying i'm doing
[1:05:43] the works of my father
[1:05:45] brother brown would say she has thus
[1:05:47] saith the lord and she knows what he
[1:05:50] wants done with it
[1:05:51] well i think he wants us to debate this
[1:05:53] quote
[1:05:55] i think he wants us to argue about what
[1:05:57] he really meant here in marriage and
[1:05:59] divorce
[1:06:00] no no i think we've debated things long
[1:06:03] enough i say it's time that we take the
[1:06:05] land i say it's time that we cross over
[1:06:08] he's already went beyond he said the
[1:06:10] land is there the land is real there's
[1:06:12] the holy ghost in this land there's
[1:06:14] healing in this land there's deliverance
[1:06:16] in this land your joys in this land
[1:06:18] cross over today and take the land and
[1:06:21] quit talking about it the land is yours
[1:06:24] it was put in your hands it's for you
[1:06:26] created for you go take the land this
[1:06:29] morning put the word in action

[1:06:36] it unto me according to that word let me
[1:06:39] play my part it's time
[1:06:42] it's time to play my part
[1:06:48] demons that held the woman at the well
[1:06:50] the demons that held mary magdalene
[1:06:53] they met jesus
[1:06:55] face to face
[1:06:58] and i believe that once again demons are
[1:07:01] having to deal with god in flesh
[1:07:06] once again they're meeting up with flesh
[1:07:08] that god is tabernacling on the inside
[1:07:10] of manifested sons of god doing the will
[1:07:13] of the father
[1:07:15] you
[1:07:16] have the power of the spoken word
[1:07:19] who
[1:07:20] you
[1:07:22] look i don't need you to see it

[1:07:46] brother andrew ain't always going to be
[1:07:48] there with you brother branham's already

[1:08:09] rights to do that today

[1:08:16] but if there's something over the
[1:08:17] mountain that you've got to get over
[1:08:18] there to do the will of god you can't
[1:08:20] get over it under it around it and yet
[1:08:23] something in your heart is telling you
[1:08:24] to go
[1:08:25] you speak the word don't you doubt and
[1:08:28] maybe when you speak the word one little
[1:08:30] grain of sand will fall but it's on its
[1:08:33] road the next day a spoonful may drop
[1:08:35] the next day a tea cup full you'll never
[1:08:38] notice it
[1:08:39] but if you will just hold steady
[1:08:41] knowing that it's being done after a
[1:08:43] while the whole thing
[1:08:46] will
[1:08:47] fall
[1:08:48] look we gotta
[1:08:50] we gotta quit binding it up brother

[1:09:25] twirled it it had never done one thing
[1:09:27] but there had to come a time where he
[1:09:29] let it loose and once you let it loose
[1:09:31] god will pick that thing up and he'll
[1:09:33] carry it to its mark it'll slay that

[1:09:52] hallelujah
[1:09:53] [Applause]
[1:10:02] we saw in our opening scripture
[1:10:06] that it came to pass in the process of
[1:10:07] time
[1:10:09] israel sighed and cried by reason of
[1:10:11] their taskmaster
[1:10:13] and god heard their cries
[1:10:15] and he remembered his promise
[1:10:18] the book of acts tells us that the time
[1:10:20] of the promise had drawn nigh
[1:10:23] there was a promise of a deliverer in
[1:10:24] egypt and that time came for him to step
[1:10:27] on the scene
[1:10:28] and that's what i'm telling you today
[1:10:30] is it's time
[1:10:32] we're here but it's time to step on the
[1:10:35] scene
[1:10:36] the prophet would talk about
[1:10:38] recognizing he was in a vision
[1:10:40] but he had to play his part
[1:10:42] he had to know when to step in when to
[1:10:45] speak this had to be in place that had
[1:10:47] to be in place i'm telling you it's in
[1:10:49] place
[1:10:50] somebody has to recognize we're there
[1:10:53] it's time for me to step on the scene
[1:10:55] and begin to do what i've been called to
[1:10:57] do
[1:10:58] in egypt they had reached the time
[1:11:00] exodus 3 12 and he said certainly i will
[1:11:03] be with thee
[1:11:04] and this shall be a token unto thee that
[1:11:06] i have sent thee
[1:11:08] when thou has brought forth the people
[1:11:09] out of egypt you shall serve god upon
[1:11:12] this mountain
[1:11:14] at this point
[1:11:16] before he's even gone down into egypt
[1:11:19] the defeat of pharaoh
[1:11:21] and the deliverance of the of israel
[1:11:23] is all settled
[1:11:25] it's a finished work at this point
[1:11:28] because he's already told them you're
[1:11:29] going to come back to this mountain
[1:11:31] and worship me here
[1:11:33] it's settled
[1:11:34] there's nothing else to debate about
[1:11:36] none of it was uncertain god plainly
[1:11:38] says i've come down to the liver i will
[1:11:40] send you i will be with you and you will
[1:11:43] come back to this mountain it's done
[1:11:45] it's a finished work but it did not
[1:11:47] happen
[1:11:48] overnight
[1:11:50] he went right back there a week later
[1:11:53] he wasn't there the next day
[1:11:55] brother brown says there was pharaoh who
[1:11:57] raised up who didn't know joseph and
[1:11:59] that was the beginning of the beginning
[1:12:02] that was the beginning of the exodus
[1:12:06] really i thought the exodus was them
[1:12:09] leaving it was
[1:12:11] but that was the beginning when a
[1:12:13] pharaoh rose up
[1:12:14] that knew not joseph
[1:12:16] and when that thing began to form under
[1:12:18] a political power began to form god
[1:12:21] began to get ready the iniquity of the
[1:12:23] amorites was fulfilled the time that he
[1:12:25] promised abraham was fulfilled and the
[1:12:28] time of deliverance was at hand
[1:12:31] so what we have to recognize and look at
[1:12:33] we can apply this to us today is that
[1:12:34] the exodus was a process
[1:12:36] there were struggles in the exodus
[1:12:40] there were great burdens in the exodus
[1:12:43] there were very difficult times during
[1:12:46] the exodus don't allow the difficult
[1:12:48] times that are surrounding us the
[1:12:50] sickness the hardships
[1:12:51] the evil in politics the whole world
[1:12:54] going mad to distract you from the fact
[1:12:56] that we are in the coming of the lord
[1:13:00] we are in the process of the coming of
[1:13:02] the lord it has already begun we're not
[1:13:05] looking for it we are in it the shout
[1:13:09] the voice
[1:13:10] the trump the time of deliverance had
[1:13:14] arrived despite the struggles despite
[1:13:16] the hardships despite the impersonators
[1:13:20] despite all those things there was a
[1:13:22] word that was already spoken i am come
[1:13:26] down to deliver
[1:13:28] the promise was already spoken look the
[1:13:31] coming of the lord is a process
[1:13:34] we are in the coming of the lord we are
[1:13:37] in the time of his coming
[1:13:39] yes there are trials yes there are
[1:13:41] hardship there is mind battles and there
[1:13:43] is sickness but there is a word already
[1:13:46] spoken and despite satan's best efforts
[1:13:50] i will have a god there will be a
[1:13:53] rapture
[1:13:54] you are that rapture and there's nothing
[1:13:57] he can do about it because it's time
[1:14:01] the time of fulfillment is here it is
[1:14:04] now we are in it
[1:14:06] it's already spoke
[1:14:08] you are the spoken word bride of jesus
[1:14:11] christ you are victorious you are
[1:14:14] overcomers
[1:14:15] hallelujah
[1:14:17] the word has already declared it
[1:14:19] and the time of the promise has drawn
[1:14:21] now
[1:14:28] people think that the rapture
[1:14:30] or the coming of the lord
[1:14:32] is a moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:14:34] event
[1:14:35] that's the body change
[1:14:38] in a moment of twinkling an eye
[1:14:40] but the coming of the lord is a process
[1:14:42] that we are currently
[1:14:44] a part of
[1:14:46] so placing ourselves at this point
[1:14:49] and looking back to the exodus
[1:14:51] what are we supposed to be doing at this
[1:14:54] point just before the excess
[1:14:58] how are things supposed to be operating
[1:15:01] how are we to carry ourselves
[1:15:03] what is our example of how we should
[1:15:05] operate
[1:15:06] at this point in history and sometimes i
[1:15:09] believe that we've allowed things to get
[1:15:10] a little twisted
[1:15:12] and allowed things to get a little bit
[1:15:13] backwards
[1:15:15] because we've allowed satan to convince
[1:15:16] us that he is in control of our lives
[1:15:19] because we are in his eden
[1:15:21] and that part is a truth this is satan's
[1:15:23] eden
[1:15:24] and so because he has control of satan's
[1:15:27] eden he wants to think you just have to
[1:15:28] bear this you're in my eating you're
[1:15:31] just going to have to deal with this
[1:15:32] you're in my eating no you're just going
[1:15:34] to have to do what it is i i say i'm
[1:15:36] going to make you struggle the whole way
[1:15:39] you are barely going to get in you are
[1:15:41] going to be tormented because you are in
[1:15:43] my eating and next thing you know you're
[1:15:45] saying oh
[1:15:46] i'm not a very good christian
[1:15:48] i don't have very much faith i mean i
[1:15:50] believe but i'm just barely getting by
[1:15:53] i'm just barely making it where's that
[1:15:55] suit coat
[1:15:56] cause i'm gonna need that uh
[1:15:57] handkerchief out of the pocket i'm sorry
[1:16:00] i'm i'm sweating down up here
[1:16:02] i forgot to get it out
[1:16:06] he makes you think you're barely going
[1:16:07] to make it in but this isn't truth at
[1:16:09] all because the bride isn't a barely
[1:16:12] make it in kind of people
[1:16:14] bride is the bride is overcomers we are
[1:16:17] people that are going to overcome in
[1:16:19] this age the truth is that you are on
[1:16:21] speaking terms again with almighty god
[1:16:25] the truth is that the pillar of fire is
[1:16:27] in the church once again the truth is
[1:16:30] that flesh once again is taking the word
[1:16:33] of god and putting it on human lips and
[1:16:36] dictating rights to the enemy that is
[1:16:39] what the truth is tonight the truth is
[1:16:41] that satan is the defeated foe he's the
[1:16:44] one that's barely hanging on he's the
[1:16:46] one hanging on by the skin of his teeth
[1:16:48] you're the overcomer you're the victor
[1:16:51] you're the one in charge you're the
[1:16:53] winner satan is cast down
[1:16:56] that's the truth of it
[1:16:58] listen
[1:17:00] i'm gonna tell you we get so caught up
[1:17:03] in terminology and facts and whatnot
[1:17:06] you can have every fact in the world and
[1:17:07] it be fact and it still not be the truth
[1:17:12] that's the truth
[1:17:14] that's also a fact
[1:17:19] but listen let me give you some facts
[1:17:21] fact is
[1:17:22] i was a sinner
[1:17:25] fact is i was lost without hope
[1:17:27] fact is i turned my back on the lord
[1:17:29] jesus i'd walked away from this message
[1:17:31] i lived the life of a ranked sinner
[1:17:34] those are facts fact is the devil
[1:17:35] thought he had me but the truth is i'm a
[1:17:38] son of god the truth is my name was
[1:17:40] written on the lamb's book of life
[1:17:42] before the foundation of the world you
[1:17:44] can line up every fact and everything
[1:17:46] but the truth is i'm gonna make it the
[1:17:49] truth is i'm gonna rapture the truth is
[1:17:52] he paid the price that's the truth
[1:17:55] oh it may be a fact i'm sick today but
[1:17:58] the truth is by his stripes you are
[1:18:01] healed
[1:18:02] that's the truth
[1:18:04] that's the truth today
[1:18:08] hallelujah
[1:18:09] the truth is
[1:18:11] i've already made it
[1:18:13] hallelujah
[1:18:15] hallelujah
[1:18:17] glory to god
[1:18:18] that's the truth today
[1:18:21] when god was made flesh in jesus christ
[1:18:23] satan's kingdom was tormented at every
[1:18:25] turn
[1:18:26] everywhere jesus went satan was cast
[1:18:29] down
[1:18:30] every demon that jesus faced
[1:18:33] was cast out
[1:18:35] death was defeated
[1:18:37] everywhere jesus went he tormented
[1:18:39] devils
[1:18:42] and here we are
[1:18:44] once again
[1:18:46] god in the flesh once again on earth god
[1:18:49] going to work on monday
[1:18:52] god going to school on monday
[1:18:54] tormenting devils not letting him enjoy
[1:18:57] in his own eating that you are the one
[1:18:59] thing that's prayer that's keeping him
[1:19:01] from having complete total control you
[1:19:03] think it's insane now you wait till the
[1:19:05] bride leaves from here
[1:19:07] you wait till we leave from here what's
[1:19:09] holding it back you are because god fled
[1:19:11] god on flesh once again saying no you've
[1:19:14] gone far enough no i'm not gonna do that
[1:19:16] no i'm not gonna bow down to your images
[1:19:19] you can heat it up seven times hotter
[1:19:21] but i'm gonna stand i will not bow to
[1:19:24] the images of this world
[1:19:26] because god in flesh once again is here
[1:19:28] tormenting and plaguing the enemy
[1:19:31] tormenting devils
[1:19:33] and the devil wants you to accept him
[1:19:35] tormenting you
[1:19:38] that's not how jesus operated
[1:19:40] i never one time see jesus going
[1:19:42] i can't deal with this one
[1:19:45] no i'm about now you're right i'm saying
[1:19:46] no sir
[1:19:47] no absolutely not and we once again
[1:19:50] jesus made flesh on the earth bone of
[1:19:52] his bone flesh of his flesh power of his
[1:19:54] power we're not backing down either
[1:19:56] we're not giving in either we are to
[1:19:58] manifest jesus christ
[1:20:01] you know somewhere along the way that
[1:20:02] got twisted too
[1:20:06] that you're just supposed to love
[1:20:07] everything about everybody
[1:20:13] you know people get hung up on the love
[1:20:14] and forgiveness part and that's part of
[1:20:16] it
[1:20:18] that's a big part of it lord i needed it
[1:20:21] and lord i'm still going to give it
[1:20:23] there's no doubt about it
[1:20:25] but some folks have turned it into some
[1:20:26] kind of hippie love
[1:20:28] where we accept everybody's little pet
[1:20:30] peeves and everybody's little pet sins
[1:20:33] and we're afraid to call it out because
[1:20:34] that's just how they are bless your
[1:20:37] heart listen the same jesus that ate
[1:20:39] with the sinners and the publicans and
[1:20:41] forgave everybody also plotted a whip
[1:20:43] he also played in the whip and said we
[1:20:45] ain't going to tolerate that in the
[1:20:46] house of god we ain't going to deal with
[1:20:48] that what happened to where we love
[1:20:50] people so much that we help them the way
[1:20:53] jesus helped them and we plant a whip
[1:20:55] and say i'll help you get rid of that
[1:20:57] spirit i'll help you get rid of that
[1:20:58] demon let's run it out of the house of
[1:21:00] god today
[1:21:03] hallelujah sometimes we need to plant a
[1:21:05] whip in the house of god
[1:21:16] bless your heart
[1:21:19] i'm so sorry that you just came over
[1:21:21] it's okay yeah it no it's not okay
[1:21:24] it's not okay
[1:21:25] and we have these little cliches that
[1:21:28] well i'll pray for you
[1:21:33] look i'm gonna tell you something
[1:21:35] i don't know why i'm here but here we
[1:21:36] are

[1:21:39] from things because they don't want
[1:21:39] deliverance from things
[1:21:42] they enjoy the petting look some people
[1:21:44] are depressed and they want you to press
[1:21:47] too

[1:23:54] the children of israel were whipped
[1:23:56] daily
[1:23:57] he was their tormentor pharaoh was there
[1:23:59] tormented for a season
[1:24:01] but the time of the promise drew nigh
[1:24:03] the pillar of fire came on the scene
[1:24:06] the word of the lord came to a prophet
[1:24:08] and it began to change
[1:24:10] who the tormentor was
[1:24:14] it was time
[1:24:15] for satan's kingdom to be plagued for a
[1:24:18] while
[1:24:19] listen moses stepped into that presence
[1:24:21] i'm just trying to get you to recognize
[1:24:23] what authority you have
[1:24:25] he came into that presence
[1:24:28] that's different from what happens with
[1:24:29] us
[1:24:31] moses came into that presence but under
[1:24:34] the blood of bulls and goats that
[1:24:35] presence could not come into
[1:24:37] him
[1:24:39] moses comes into that presence moses had
[1:24:43] the word
[1:24:46] you
[1:24:47] are
[1:24:48] the word
[1:24:50] let that sink in for a minute because
[1:24:52] that couldn't come in and dwell on the
[1:24:54] inside of him because he's under
[1:24:56] the blood of bulls and goats and yet
[1:24:59] under the blood of bulls and goats he
[1:25:00] goes down to satan's kingdom
[1:25:03] and he begins to plague him
[1:25:05] what are we supposed to do right before
[1:25:07] the exodus brother aaron
[1:25:08] it's time to start plaguing the devil
[1:25:11] it's time to begin to put things on your
[1:25:13] lips and call for what you have need of
[1:25:15] that's what we're supposed to do right
[1:25:16] before the rapture we are to plague his
[1:25:19] kingdom we are to ruin his eden to where
[1:25:22] it gets to the point that he's so sick
[1:25:24] and tired of it he finally says take
[1:25:26] your stuff take your peace take your joy
[1:25:29] take your kids and just get out of here
[1:25:31] i'm sick and tired of you ruining my
[1:25:33] kingdom i've spent years creating this
[1:25:35] eden i've got everybody bowing down
[1:25:38] everybody's telling me what i want to
[1:25:39] hear they're caving in to the lgbtq
[1:25:42] elemental p of all these things going on
[1:25:44] in the world today but there's somebody
[1:25:46] says not me i'll stand for truth i'll
[1:25:48] stand for the message i'll stand for
[1:25:50] what's right i won't bow down to your
[1:25:53] image i'll stand he says i've had enough
[1:25:56] just take your stuff take it and get out
[1:25:58] of here just leave it's time to torment
[1:26:02] the devil
[1:26:04] it's time to look him in the face and
[1:26:05] say no you've whipped me long enough
[1:26:09] [Applause]
[1:26:15] the children of israel began to cry out
[1:26:18] they'd had enough
[1:26:20] they were tired of bondage they were
[1:26:22] sick of their taskmasters
[1:26:24] sick of fear
[1:26:26] sick of depression
[1:26:28] sick of anxiety
[1:26:31] all the things that the enemy was trying
[1:26:32] to put on them
[1:26:34] sick of losing their children
[1:26:38] you had those like amram that begin to
[1:26:40] cry out to god
[1:26:42] begin to remind god of his promises god
[1:26:45] loves to be reminded of his promises

[1:27:17] who had done the whipping the one who
[1:27:19] had destroyed their children the one who
[1:27:21] had made them sick the one who had made
[1:27:23] them captain was about to have the wrath
[1:27:26] of god poured out on him his kingdom was
[1:27:28] about to be plagued and how was god
[1:27:31] going to do it
[1:27:32] how is he going to do it how is he going
[1:27:34] to do this it's just moses but see the
[1:27:37] thing is the word had already been
[1:27:38] spoken the word had already been spoken
[1:27:41] all the way back with abraham in genesis
[1:27:42] 15 13 he said unto abram no assurity
[1:27:46] that thy seed shall be a stranger in a
[1:27:47] land that is not theirs and shall serve
[1:27:50] them and they shall afflict them four
[1:27:51] hundred years and also that nation whom
[1:27:54] they shall serve will i judge

[1:28:21] out of the devil's hand and turn it
[1:28:23] around and begin whipping on the devil
[1:28:26] prophet of god says sure right here in

[1:31:50] do
[1:31:51] all those wonders before pharaoh which i
[1:31:53] have put in
[1:31:55] thine
[1:31:57] i'm gonna do it
[1:31:59] but i'm gonna do it through
[1:32:01] you
[1:32:02] we're gonna plug pharaoh so much that
[1:32:04] he's gonna kick you out but i'm gonna do
[1:32:06] it through i put it
[1:32:08] in your hands to take care of this
[1:32:11] it's god doing the deliverance it's the
[1:32:13] power of god it's his signs and wonders
[1:32:16] but it's in your hands
[1:32:18] it's you that's gonna show the enemy
[1:32:20] it's you that's gonna proclaim it's
[1:32:22] jesus again
[1:32:23] he's here again in flesh prophet would
[1:32:26] say in moses under the blood of that
[1:32:28] goat that sheep walked out there took
[1:32:31] that stick reached towards the east thus
[1:32:33] saith the lord let there be flies never
[1:32:36] heard a fly walked on back it's already
[1:32:38] spoke it's a thought now it's spoke it's
[1:32:40] expressed it's the word of god then it
[1:32:43] come into human lips a simple man under
[1:32:45] the blood of a bull first thing you know
[1:32:47] a green fly began to fly around
[1:32:50] next thing you know there were five
[1:32:51] pounds per yard what was it was the word
[1:32:54] of god spoken through moses the creator
[1:32:57] because under the blood he was standing
[1:32:59] in the presence of god and his own words
[1:33:02] wasn't his word
[1:33:04] if ye abide in me and my words about and
[1:33:06] you then ask what you will it shall be
[1:33:08] given you where's the church standing at
[1:33:11] he says
[1:33:12] let there be frogs and there wasn't a
[1:33:14] frog in the country but in an hour's
[1:33:15] time they were ten foot deep in places
[1:33:18] what was it it was god the creator
[1:33:20] hiding himself in a simple man i want to
[1:33:23] ask you something if the blood of a bull
[1:33:25] or a goat be used for a bleach which can
[1:33:28] only cover could put a man in position
[1:33:30] to speak the creative word of god and
[1:33:32] bring flies into existence why would you
[1:33:35] stumble at the bleach of jesus christ's
[1:33:37] blood who could speak a squirrel or
[1:33:40] something into existence
[1:33:43] we read the bible
[1:33:44] under the blood of bulls and goats he's
[1:33:46] speaking flies he's speaking frogs he's
[1:33:49] speaking the the blood the nile turning
[1:33:51] the blood and we don't bat an eye
[1:33:54] but let a prophet speak about speaking a
[1:33:56] squirrel and news oh
[1:33:59] come on now
[1:34:00] or let a man talk about seeing a vision
[1:34:02] well
[1:34:04] come on now that was for the prophet
[1:34:08] you take away from the prophet when you
[1:34:10] do
[1:34:11] i say it takes away from the message of
[1:34:12] the hour if those things aren't in the
[1:34:14] message
[1:34:15] i say those are the very things that
[1:34:17] vindicate the message is true i say that
[1:34:20] if you don't have dreams and visions in
[1:34:22] the church then you're taken away from
[1:34:23] scripture in joel 2 28 the scripture
[1:34:26] said those things are going to be here
[1:34:28] so i say they got to be here
[1:34:30] if a man can stand there under the blood
[1:34:32] of bulls and goats and speak those
[1:34:34] things and torment satan what can you do
[1:34:37] under the shed blood of the lord jesus
[1:34:39] christ filled with the baptism of the
[1:34:41] holy ghost you can plague satan you can
[1:34:44] tear his kingdom down you can speak
[1:34:46] destruction upon this this evil hour
[1:34:49] that we live in
[1:34:50] you can do it
[1:34:51] that's what i want you to get today
[1:34:54] you can do it
[1:34:56] god had come down to deliver israel
[1:35:01] he came down to show judgment against
[1:35:03] israel but how did he do it boy you say
[1:35:06] that a lot brother i've been teaching
[1:35:07] sixth graders for 15 years
[1:35:11] i've repeated myself a lot
[1:35:14] it's what i do
[1:35:16] i repeat myself a lot
[1:35:18] he did it in flesh
[1:35:20] he did it through flesh how's he going
[1:35:22] to overcome every single demon in
[1:35:24] laodicea
[1:35:26] flesh
[1:35:27] every single one of them is going to be
[1:35:29] tormented by flesh exodus 7 1 the lord
[1:35:32] said unto moses see
[1:35:33] i have made thee a god to pharaoh
[1:35:37] then as a god i say it's time we do god
[1:35:39] things
[1:35:40] i say it's time we stand in our position
[1:35:42] and we put the word in action i say it's
[1:35:44] time that a third pool people start to
[1:35:46] do third pool things
[1:35:48] it's time that we operate and what he's
[1:35:50] called us to so we know the story and
[1:35:52] i'm gonna move quickly now how pharaoh
[1:35:54] began to make things more difficult on
[1:35:56] them after moses said let let israel go
[1:35:59] god has commanded you to let israel go
[1:36:01] and as we said it didn't happen
[1:36:02] instantly
[1:36:04] it didn't happen right there in that
[1:36:05] moment the exodus was a process
[1:36:08] but in so doing
[1:36:10] pharaoh began to make things more
[1:36:12] difficult right at the time of the
[1:36:14] exodus is when things got harder when
[1:36:16] there were more burdens and more
[1:36:17] unbelief trying to get the people to
[1:36:19] quit and he's pushing against some of
[1:36:21] you even today some of you even the last
[1:36:23] week in the last couple weeks things
[1:36:25] have come against you and it makes you
[1:36:26] wonder why i even keep pressing
[1:36:28] why even keep fighting why is he doing
[1:36:31] that because you're right at the moment
[1:36:32] of exodus you're right at the moment of
[1:36:34] freedom you're right at the moment of
[1:36:35] the rapture
[1:36:37] and he begins to push and he begins to
[1:36:39] push exodus six and nine
[1:36:42] and moses spake so unto the children of
[1:36:44] israel but they hearken not unto moses
[1:36:46] for anguish of spirit and for cruel
[1:36:48] bondage
[1:36:50] listen let me stop here for just a
[1:36:52] moment and tell you that the bondage of
[1:36:54] the enemy is cruel
[1:36:57] don't toy with it today
[1:36:59] don't play with it today
[1:37:01] if you're somebody that's sitting on the
[1:37:03] fence and you're not sure if it's true
[1:37:04] and you've never had that experience
[1:37:06] with almighty god you don't want to
[1:37:08] experience the cruelness of the bondage
[1:37:11] of the enemy as somebody who has
[1:37:13] experienced it and has the scars to
[1:37:15] prove it i'm telling you there's nothing
[1:37:16] out there that you want a part of
[1:37:18] there is nothing there but maybe some
[1:37:20] temporary joy for a fleeting moment and
[1:37:23] then days and days of depression and
[1:37:25] days and days of regret and worry and
[1:37:27] fear but i'm telling you if you ever one
[1:37:30] time we'll just taste and see that the
[1:37:32] lord is good if you'll ever just give
[1:37:34] him an opportunity to change your life
[1:37:36] you'll never be the same and you'll
[1:37:37] never want to be the same ever again
[1:37:41] the task masters of this world are very
[1:37:43] cruel
[1:37:46] upon being commanded to let my people go
[1:37:48] pharaoh replies
[1:37:50] who is the lord
[1:37:53] who is the lord
[1:37:55] i'ma read a bit here
[1:37:57] see egypt had many gods
[1:38:00] and so what pharaoh is saying when he
[1:38:02] says who is the lord is
[1:38:04] i have my own gods
[1:38:07] why should i listen to yours
[1:38:10] why should i obey your god who is he
[1:38:14] i i want to tell you that was a dumb
[1:38:16] question because he was about to find
[1:38:17] out
[1:38:18] he says who is he
[1:38:20] the egyptians like many pagan cultures
[1:38:23] worshiped a wide variety of nature gods
[1:38:26] and attributed to their powers the
[1:38:27] natural phenomenon they saw in the world
[1:38:29] around them
[1:38:31] there was the god of the sun of the
[1:38:33] river of childbirth of crops etc etc etc
[1:38:37] so when saying who is the lord that i
[1:38:39] should obey his voice pharaoh actually
[1:38:41] made a challenge
[1:38:43] is your god more powerful than my gods
[1:38:48] is your god more powerful than me
[1:38:53] the first plague turning the nile to
[1:38:55] blood was a judgment against apis the
[1:38:57] god of the nile isis the goddess of the
[1:39:00] nile and noon the guardian of the nile
[1:39:03] pharaoh is told by this you will know
[1:39:05] that i am the lord the second plague
[1:39:08] bringing frogs from the nile was a
[1:39:09] judgment against hakket the frog-headed
[1:39:12] goddess of birth frogs were thought to
[1:39:14] be sacred and never to be killed god had
[1:39:17] the frogs invade every part of the homes
[1:39:19] of the egyptians and when the frogs died
[1:39:21] their stinking bodies were heaped up in
[1:39:23] offensive piles all through the land the
[1:39:26] third plague gnats was a judgment on set
[1:39:28] the god of the desert the fourth plague
[1:39:31] flies was a judgment on uchitch the fly
[1:39:33] god and this the fly god the fifth
[1:39:36] plague the death of livestock was a
[1:39:38] judgment on the goddess of hathor and
[1:39:40] the god apis who were both depicted as
[1:39:42] cattle the six plague bulls was a
[1:39:44] judgment against several gods over
[1:39:47] health and disease the seventh plague
[1:39:49] hail attacked nut the sky goddess osiris
[1:39:52] the crop fertility god and set the storm
[1:39:55] god the eighth plague locust again
[1:39:57] focused on nut osiris and set the later
[1:40:00] crops wheat and rye which had survived
[1:40:02] the hell were now devoured by the swarms
[1:40:05] of locusts there would be no harvest in
[1:40:07] egypt that year the ninth plague
[1:40:10] darkness was aimed at the sun god ra who
[1:40:13] was symbolized by pharaoh himself and
[1:40:15] for three days the land of egypt was
[1:40:17] smothered in unearthly darkness but the
[1:40:20] homes of the israelites had light the
[1:40:23] tenth and last plague the death of the
[1:40:25] firstborn males was a judgment on all
[1:40:28] the egyptian gods including pharaoh
[1:40:31] himself
[1:40:32] what was this
[1:40:34] god taking the flesh of a man and making
[1:40:37] the gods of that evil age bow down
[1:40:39] before him and say we have no power over
[1:40:42] this god he's taken a people in this day
[1:40:45] and when depression comes when the gods
[1:40:47] of pornography and lust comes there's
[1:40:49] somebody that says i'm not gonna bow
[1:40:51] down to that and once again god raises
[1:40:53] up and says your gods will bow down at
[1:40:56] the feet of flesh once again of god and
[1:40:59] flesh who will stand and make the gods
[1:41:01] of laodicea bow down and will show they
[1:41:03] have no power over this god who is your
[1:41:06] god that i should obey him oh he is
[1:41:08] jehovah god he is the lord jesus christ
[1:41:11] he is the all-powerful and the gods of
[1:41:13] laodicea will bow down once again before
[1:41:16] him he has rendered them powerless in
[1:41:19] this day through a people
[1:41:22] the god of depression the god of anxiety
[1:41:25] the god of sickness the god that comes
[1:41:27] and says you have to look at all this
[1:41:29] naked flesh there is a people on the
[1:41:30] earth that says no i will not bow down i
[1:41:33] will be free i will rise above it we
[1:41:36] will be healthy we will have our
[1:41:37] children we will have our joy why do you
[1:41:40] keep saying those things are promises
[1:41:42] you are supposed to have those things
[1:41:45] don't let the gods of this age have one
[1:41:48] thing in your life
[1:41:50] he stood against those gods
[1:41:52] and showed that no demon power can stand
[1:41:54] before a a man in flesh when he takes
[1:41:57] the word of god upon his lips
[1:42:00] for the sake of time i'm going to skip
[1:42:03] ahead and try to bring this down
[1:42:06] that's where we're at right now
[1:42:08] the time has drawn now
[1:42:11] it's drawn now it's time we stop waiting
[1:42:14] this
[1:42:15] is how we fight our battles
[1:42:17] by taking the word of god upon our lips
[1:42:20] red sea part
[1:42:22] depression in the name of jesus leave
[1:42:25] sickness by his stripes i'm healed
[1:42:28] taking the word upon your lips
[1:42:31] jesus
[1:42:33] constantly tormenting the devil
[1:42:35] plaguing him in our opening scripture we
[1:42:37] read the account of legion from matthew
[1:42:39] and also from mark
[1:42:43] legion was a tormented soul
[1:42:45] a prisoner a slave tormented by demons
[1:42:48] demons a different type of slavery than
[1:42:49] what we've been dealing with
[1:42:51] with israel
[1:42:53] and maybe today you're not lost
[1:42:55] and out of your mind like legion was
[1:42:58] maybe it's a demon of depression
[1:43:01] or something like that that's changed
[1:43:02] itself to you maybe a sickness
[1:43:05] that has attached itself to you
[1:43:07] maybe it's a spirit of fear
[1:43:08] a spirit of doubt
[1:43:10] whatever it is it's a cruel taskmaster
[1:43:14] that's been plaguing you and tormenting
[1:43:15] you
[1:43:16] and we know that legion would dwell in
[1:43:18] the tombs
[1:43:20] and it said that nothing could tame him
[1:43:22] he was completely bound by satan
[1:43:25] but i want to encourage you to know that
[1:43:26] wherever you're at tonight my god hears
[1:43:28] the faintest hearts cry
[1:43:30] and maybe one night he'd come to himself
[1:43:32] just long enough to say god help me
[1:43:35] maybe that's all there was to it maybe
[1:43:36] it wasn't some altar call maybe it's
[1:43:38] just
[1:43:39] lord help me
[1:43:41] but it traveled down through
[1:43:43] miles and miles and miles to wherever
[1:43:45] jesus was and he hears the hearts cry
[1:43:48] lord help me
[1:43:50] lord i need you
[1:43:51] that was all it took
[1:43:53] and he crosses over a rage and see why
[1:43:56] it was time
[1:43:59] it was time for legion to be delivered
[1:44:02] why did he show up in elkton virginia
[1:44:04] here today because it's time
[1:44:07] it's time for you and for your
[1:44:08] deliverance and what you have need of
[1:44:11] and those demons had chained themselves
[1:44:12] to legion
[1:44:14] that's what they do
[1:44:15] they chain themselves
[1:44:17] but see that's a mistake when you're
[1:44:20] dealing with the with a child of god
[1:44:23] that's a mistake
[1:44:25] because you think for one minute those
[1:44:26] demons would have ran up into the
[1:44:28] presence of the lord jesus christ on
[1:44:30] purpose
[1:44:32] but the problem is they had chained
[1:44:34] themselves to legion
[1:44:36] they had changed themselves there they
[1:44:38] like to hide behind fear
[1:44:40] they like to hide behind worry
[1:44:43] they like to hold you back and exactly
[1:44:45] what do people think
[1:44:46] i'm telling you today if you got a need
[1:44:48] don't let them hold you back today
[1:44:51] don't let them hold you in your seat
[1:44:52] today don't let them hold you in that
[1:44:53] place of fear hiding behind well what
[1:44:55] about this and what about that don't be
[1:44:57] held back today
[1:44:59] those task masters that want you to
[1:45:00] believe that they have control of your
[1:45:02] life
[1:45:03] that you can't be healed
[1:45:04] that you can't have joy
[1:45:07] that you can't have deliverance they
[1:45:09] beat legion daily
[1:45:11] you're a failure
[1:45:13] you'll never be free you'll never be
[1:45:15] like the other people in the church
[1:45:17] you'll never be set free you'll never be
[1:45:18] loosed you'll never have your joy you'll
[1:45:20] never have your head and they beat him
[1:45:22] they tormented him they whipped him
[1:45:25] but things were about to change
[1:45:27] just like they had done in egypt things
[1:45:29] were about to turn why how it was time
[1:45:33] legion fought through all of that
[1:45:35] see in order to be delivered today you
[1:45:38] have to desire to be delivered
[1:45:40] you have to care enough to not care
[1:45:42] anymore i don't care what people think i
[1:45:45] don't care where i'm at i don't care how
[1:45:47] long i've been in this condition i care
[1:45:49] enough though to be free today i want to
[1:45:51] get to the feet of jesus i want to push
[1:45:53] through all that brother brown said he
[1:45:55] cared when the neurotic called legion
[1:45:57] cared enough under opposition to wiggle
[1:45:59] out from under those tombstones of the
[1:46:01] devils and go out to meet jesus and
[1:46:03] throw himself prostrate when legion all
[1:46:05] them devils would have never come if
[1:46:07] legion hadn't pushed his way out there
[1:46:09] to meet him and when he cared enough to
[1:46:11] make that effort that stand in his
[1:46:13] belief jesus cared enough to cast out
[1:46:15] the legion of devils from him and this
[1:46:17] neurotic condition was gone he cared
[1:46:20] when you care yes sir he cares when you
[1:46:23] care
[1:46:24] see those demons would have never come
[1:46:26] but they had no choice
[1:46:28] they had chained themselves to legion
[1:46:31] see the chains that bound legion were
[1:46:34] the very chains that would now drag
[1:46:36] those demons into the presence of god
[1:46:39] let me take a detour here for just a
[1:46:41] second
[1:46:42] and tell you there was a greek king in
[1:46:44] ancient times named mr mizentius i'm not
[1:46:48] greek pardon me
[1:46:49] he was known to be hateful and cruel
[1:46:52] he had no respect for life he was a
[1:46:54] great warrior on the battlefield he's
[1:46:56] remembered in history as the one who
[1:46:58] used what was known as the body of death
[1:47:01] torture
[1:47:02] as a form of punishment if you were
[1:47:04] captured in battle they would take a
[1:47:06] corpse a freshly killed corpse
[1:47:09] of one of your brothers and they would
[1:47:11] chain it to you face to face
[1:47:13] hand to hand
[1:47:15] foot to foot
[1:47:17] and you would be chained to it
[1:47:19] and you'd be sitting there to where
[1:47:21] that's all you could see
[1:47:23] the prisoner would struggle and try to
[1:47:25] shake free
[1:47:26] but after a while they felt like it was
[1:47:28] useless i'm chained to this thing
[1:47:30] i'll never be free from this when you
[1:47:32] moved it moved
[1:47:34] when you wiggled it wiggled and
[1:47:35] destroyed stared you in the face at all
[1:47:37] times
[1:47:38] you would begin to give in to the fact
[1:47:40] that you were stuck to this corpse
[1:47:43] face to face
[1:47:44] staring dead death right in the face it
[1:47:47] weighed you down it depressed you
[1:47:50] and that's exactly what the devil's done
[1:47:52] to some people with their depression
[1:47:54] he chains it to him
[1:47:56] with their anxiety he changed it to him
[1:47:58] with their failures he changed it to him
[1:48:00] and that's all you can see is the
[1:48:02] symptoms i try to move brother andrew
[1:48:03] but all i can see is the sickness
[1:48:06] i try to move but it's chained to me all
[1:48:08] i see is my failures all i see is my
[1:48:11] shortcomings all i see is death
[1:48:13] everywhere i'm not going to be able to
[1:48:14] get free of it it was agonizing
[1:48:17] you knew you needed to be free you hated
[1:48:20] being chained to it you could see it
[1:48:22] sucking the life out of you but what
[1:48:24] could you do
[1:48:26] you were stuck
[1:48:28] satan does that he changed that
[1:48:29] depression to you he changed
[1:48:31] condemnation to you he torments you he
[1:48:34] plagues you but there's a difference
[1:48:37] when it's to a child of god
[1:48:39] there's a difference when you change it
[1:48:41] to a child of god because when the
[1:48:43] tables turn when you become the
[1:48:45] tormentor when you become the plaguer
[1:48:48] now it's not that he's chained to you
[1:48:50] but now he's stuck
[1:48:51] he's got nowhere to go he's got nowhere
[1:48:54] to run
[1:48:56] oh how is it come here brother andrew
[1:48:58] that depression grabs a hold of you and
[1:49:00] it leads you around and it guides you
[1:49:02] everywhere you're going to go and you
[1:49:04] can't be free it's all you see and maybe
[1:49:06] you get up enough strength and you say
[1:49:08] today we're going to church
[1:49:10] i'm going to go
[1:49:11] i'm going to go and he's still there and
[1:49:13] you're bringing and you sit down and you
[1:49:16] battle and you fight and you're not
[1:49:17] getting much out of the service but the
[1:49:19] god's calling you and it's a struggle
[1:49:21] but slowly you begin to raise a hand you
[1:49:24] begin to worship you begin to enter in
[1:49:26] and he's still fighting you recognize
[1:49:28] jesus is there and you bring him you
[1:49:31] drag the devil i'll be free i'll be free
[1:49:35] i'll be free and you come to the feet of
[1:49:37] jesus
[1:49:39] oh he's stuck
[1:49:40] drag him into the presence of god
[1:49:43] fight through push through
[1:49:45] fight today drag him to the presence of
[1:49:48] god
[1:49:49] he's stuck
[1:49:52] hallelujah
[1:49:54] push through today
[1:49:56] drag that demon
[1:49:58] drag that enemy
[1:50:02] turn the tables
[1:50:04] it's time
[1:50:06] it's time to turn it on the enemy today
[1:50:11] glory
[1:50:13] hallelujah
[1:50:15] hallelujah you can stay standing
[1:50:17] you can stay with me for a second
[1:50:19] i'm dumb i got to drive something home
[1:50:23] he begs god he begs jesus don't torment
[1:50:25] him
[1:50:27] don't do it
[1:50:28] he says why are you doing it
[1:50:30] before the time
[1:50:32] they knew there was a time coming
[1:50:35] they knew there was a time coming
[1:50:37] where man and flesh
[1:50:39] was supposed to torment him
[1:50:41] they said why are you doing this now
[1:50:44] before the time
[1:50:46] why are you plaguing me
[1:50:48] in other words
[1:50:49] why now
[1:50:50] what did they mean
[1:50:52] what did they mean
[1:50:54] those task masters
[1:50:58] had been tormented
[1:51:00] by man
[1:51:02] taking god upon his lips
[1:51:04] before the excess
[1:51:07] where the tables had been turned
[1:51:09] and the tormentor became the tormentor
[1:51:12] became the tormented
[1:51:15] why torment us before the time
[1:51:17] those demons spoke
[1:51:19] of this time
[1:51:21] they knew there was a time coming they
[1:51:23] knew there was an hour of torment coming
[1:51:25] they knew there was a time that they
[1:51:27] would be told to go and they would had
[1:51:29] to go they just didn't think it was
[1:51:30] going to be you that done it
[1:51:32] they just didn't know it was going to be
[1:51:34] you that done
[1:51:35] imagine those demons of depression and
[1:51:37] fear and anxiety that were cast out
[1:51:39] every time they met jesus and they would
[1:51:41] look inside those eyes and realize there
[1:51:43] was something different there there's
[1:51:44] something different in there i don't
[1:51:46] want no part of that and here you are
