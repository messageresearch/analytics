[45:17] oh he's so good
[45:21] all the time
[45:25] so greetings to the church that is
[45:27] gathered at full gospel lighthouse
[45:29] tabernacle
[45:30] we're happy to be joined with you this
[45:31] weekend around
[45:33] god's revealed word in this hour for
[45:36] many years now we've been
[45:38] having annual meetings at this time and
[45:41] for many years brother ron spencer has
[45:43] been a part of these meetings
[45:45] and truly we've seen god work through
[45:47] the gift over the years
[45:49] we've been blessed and as a result
[45:52] brother on has a special place in our
[45:53] hearts
[45:55] and some years ago we we also invited
[45:58] brother andrew to come
[46:00] his son and we witnessed the gift in him
[46:03] and as he ministered alongside his
[46:05] father and we saw god working it's
[46:08] important to see god
[46:09] not just to where he was but what he's
[46:11] doing and so we believe god's working
[46:14] through brother andrew
[46:15] spencer and he's matured and he's
[46:18] ministering and he came administered for
[46:20] our youth at a graduation one time
[46:23] last year was the first year that we
[46:25] could not have
[46:27] either one of them or brother ron here
[46:30] in person
[46:31] and so we moved to what the world gives
[46:35] us via technology and we did a video
[46:37] streaming
[46:38] well it wasn't what we desired it was a
[46:41] blessing last year if you all remember
[46:43] that
[46:44] wasn't that a blessing i believe that
[46:47] to be so amen and so
[46:51] this year again we are going to
[46:55] do whatever opportunity we've been given
[46:57] so we're going to be
[46:59] gathering in person here and streaming
[47:02] together
[47:03] with the church that's gathered there so
[47:06] we're going to take as much opportunity
[47:07] as we can to make much of this
[47:10] and we believe the holy spirit will will
[47:12] work for us so
[47:14] today as we are going to be in
[47:15] expectation with you
[47:17] and to hear the word we when you say
[47:20] amen we're going to say amen
[47:22] when you stand to your feet we're going
[47:23] to stand to our feet so whatever you're
[47:25] doing there remember there's a group of
[47:27] believers that have the same holy spirit
[47:30] and they're going to do the same thing
[47:32] so we want to just say we're happy to be
[47:34] joined with you
[47:35] and we're going to do our very best so
[47:38] we welcome you this weekend
[47:40] and we look forward to what the lord
[47:42] will do
[47:44] uh one more thing i do want to say is we
[47:46] know that
[47:47] over in the church there you had a man
[47:50] of god that was beloved in your midst
[47:52] for many years and
[47:54] he's gone on to be the lord and be with
[47:56] the lord and that was brother ron's
[47:58] father-in-law sister connie's father
[48:00] brother homer fraser
[48:02] so we thank god for his life we also
[48:05] have a man here
[48:06] who has done much for the kingdom of god
[48:09] labored for many years
[48:11] and we've asked him to give you a little
[48:14] greeting
[48:14] he is sending this to you via his office
[48:18] but we're going to just play that little
[48:20] clip for you and

[56:42] 1.
[56:47] isaiah chapter 52 and verse 1
[56:50] and this evening i'd like to speak to
[56:52] you on something that the lord laid on
[56:54] my heart a couple months ago when
[56:58] when uh when we were we were
[57:01] referring to these meetings and setting
[57:03] them up
[57:05] i'd like to speak to you this evening on
[57:07] rising
[57:09] rising from the ashes rising from the
[57:12] ashes
[57:13] isaiah chapter 52 and verse 1 and the
[57:16] bible says awake
[57:17] awake put on thy strength o zion
[57:20] and put on thy beautiful garments o
[57:22] jerusalem
[57:24] the holy city for henceforth there shall
[57:26] no more come
[57:27] into thee the uncircumcised and the
[57:30] unclean
[57:32] shake thyself from the dust arise and
[57:35] sit down
[57:36] o jerusalem loose thyself from the bands
[57:39] of thy neck o captive daughters of zion
[57:42] for thus saith the lord you have sold
[57:44] yourselves for not and
[57:45] you shall be redeemed without money for
[57:48] thus saith the lord
[57:50] god my people went down a fourth time
[57:52] into egypt it's adjourned there
[57:55] and the assyrian oppressed them without
[57:57] cause
[57:58] now therefore what have i hear saith the
[58:01] lord that my people was taken away for
[58:03] not
[58:04] they that rule over them make them to
[58:08] how saith the lord and my name
[58:10] continually
[58:11] every day is blasphemed therefore
[58:15] my people are you his people this amen
[58:19] shall know my name therefore they shall
[58:22] know
[58:23] in that day that i am he that does speak
[58:26] behold it is i how beautiful
[58:30] upon the mountains are the feet of him
[58:32] that bringeth good tidings that
[58:33] publisheth peace
[58:35] that bringeth good tidings of good that
[58:38] publish
[58:39] salvation that saith unto zion thy
[58:43] god reigneth thy watchmen shall lift up
[58:46] the voice with the voice together shall
[58:49] they sing for they shall see eye to eye
[58:52] when the lord shall bring again zion
[58:56] verse 9 break forth into joy
[58:59] sing together ye waste places of
[59:02] jerusalem for the lord hath
[59:04] comforted his people he hath
[59:07] redeemed jerusalem the lord hath
[59:11] made bear his holy arm in the eyes of
[59:15] all the nations and all the ends of the
[59:18] earth
[59:18] shall see the salvation of our god
[59:22] may god bless his word you may be seated
[59:24] in the presence of the most high god
[59:27] here we we see as we also are aware in
[59:31] isaiah chapter 53 where the bible tells
[59:33] us that who
[59:35] report hath you believed and who
[59:38] to whom is the arm of the lord revealed
[59:40] he
[59:41] in this day has shown and revealed his
[59:44] great arm of power
[59:46] and shone it before the all the eyes of
[59:50] the nation
[59:51] and to me to begin to think about this
[59:53] evening as we take this topic on the
[59:55] rising from the ashes to begin to think
[59:57] about
[59:58] that that the god of heaven is
[1:00:01] in control and the god of heaven wants
[1:00:04] to be a part of each and every one of
[1:00:05] our intricate details
[1:00:07] of our lives he he wants to go to work
[1:00:09] with us he wants to
[1:00:10] he wants to be in business with us he
[1:00:12] wants to be our banker he wants to be
[1:00:14] our lawyer
[1:00:15] and to think that tonight that you and i
[1:00:18] are so important to god
[1:00:20] and that that god knows our beginnings
[1:00:22] and he knows our endings he knows our
[1:00:24] comings and he knows our goings
[1:00:26] and that our god is is the only god and
[1:00:29] he is so interested in each and every
[1:00:31] one of us and he
[1:00:32] and he cares for us and he has watched
[1:00:35] over us
[1:00:36] all the days and all of our nights when
[1:00:38] we are not awake he is awake when
[1:00:40] when when we're sleeping he's not
[1:00:42] slumbering but he has told us that that
[1:00:45] he
[1:00:45] is the great i am and and that when
[1:00:48] moses was requiring
[1:00:49] who would go and who shall i say has
[1:00:51] sent me you tell them
[1:00:53] that i am that i am has sent me and if
[1:00:55] you could realize that this evening
[1:00:57] that the god of heaven that controls all
[1:01:00] time
[1:01:00] space and eternity has your very life
[1:01:04] in his hands and that he knows your he
[1:01:06] knows your comings and he knows you're
[1:01:08] going see
[1:01:08] he knows which way that that you're
[1:01:11] going forth and he knows what you're
[1:01:12] going to come of and what's going to
[1:01:14] come in your life
[1:01:15] and that this god is is spinning
[1:01:17] everything in order just the way that
[1:01:20] that things are meant to be and things
[1:01:22] that are supposed to be he's spinning
[1:01:24] that thing and he's and he's rolling
[1:01:25] worlds off of his fingertips and he's
[1:01:27] making things come out
[1:01:29] for the good to them that love god he's
[1:01:31] spinning things this evening
[1:01:33] he spun jupiter off of his fingers he's
[1:01:35] he spun
[1:01:36] mars off of his finger he he spoke and
[1:01:39] it was and
[1:01:40] and this god knows how to spin and make
[1:01:42] you above
[1:01:43] and not beneath and and this this we
[1:01:46] know that the god of heaven is
[1:01:47] is is for us this evening and we could
[1:01:50] say like paul has said that
[1:01:52] that what shall we say to these things
[1:01:54] that if the god of heaven that the god
[1:01:56] that holds
[1:01:57] all these things in his hands if we know
[1:01:59] that what shall we say to these things
[1:02:01] if
[1:02:02] if we know that that he is our redeemer
[1:02:04] if he is our shepherd if he is our
[1:02:07] buckler
[1:02:07] if he is our sword if he is our
[1:02:09] sustainer if he is our everything if he
[1:02:12] is
[1:02:12] our all in all what shall we say to
[1:02:14] these things
[1:02:15] that if the god of almighty the god of
[1:02:19] of the i am the god who is the god who
[1:02:21] ain't changing
[1:02:22] but if this god be for us then then who
[1:02:25] in the world can be against us cancer
[1:02:28] can't stop us
[1:02:29] sickness can't hinder us covet couldn't
[1:02:31] stop us
[1:02:32] they could mask us up and try to shut us
[1:02:34] up but this god is watching over you
[1:02:37] he who was who is and is to come has
[1:02:40] your very life
[1:02:41] in his hands and the bible tells us that
[1:02:44] we are written on the palms of his hands
[1:02:46] and who is able to pluck us out of the
[1:02:48] hands of a mighty god
[1:02:50] to think that tonight that this very god
[1:02:52] that is so interested in you
[1:02:54] is the one that spoke and there was he
[1:02:57] said let there be and there was light
[1:02:59] now that doesn't so
[1:03:01] that the son doesn't show up till the
[1:03:03] fourth day god is the kind of god that
[1:03:05] he don't have to be invited to your
[1:03:06] party
[1:03:07] he'll just show up to your party i want
[1:03:09] you to know that the god that you're
[1:03:11] serving
[1:03:12] he don't have to explain himself he
[1:03:14] don't have to figure it out he don't
[1:03:15] have to make you figure out or reason it
[1:03:17] out in your own mind
[1:03:18] he's already god he always was god he
[1:03:21] ain't changing
[1:03:23] he knew the mess and the dilemma that
[1:03:25] you are in and the crisis and the chaos
[1:03:28] and he is the one that is coming riding
[1:03:31] on the zigzag
[1:03:32] lightning he's riding to your situation
[1:03:35] he's riding over your devil
[1:03:37] and if the lord this lord that had not
[1:03:40] been us
[1:03:40] on our side then the enemy would have
[1:03:42] swallowed us up a long time ago
[1:03:45] he'd have shut us up he'd shut us down
[1:03:47] the waters would've overwhelmed us
[1:03:49] the proud waters that had gone over our
[1:03:51] soul but blessed be the lord
[1:03:54] that is on my side who has not given us
[1:03:57] over to the prey
[1:03:58] of the teeth of the enemy this god is
[1:04:01] going to make sure that you come
[1:04:03] out this god's going to make sure you're
[1:04:05] an overcomer
[1:04:06] this god's going to make sure that you
[1:04:08] win this god's going to make sure
[1:04:10] that you're going to have a baby this
[1:04:12] god's going to make sure
[1:04:14] that you make the rapture this god is a
[1:04:16] sure
[1:04:17] god and he's given you a sure word of
[1:04:19] prophecy
[1:04:20] and he is not changing because he's the
[1:04:24] same
[1:04:24] yesterday today and forever
[1:04:28] he is the god who walks and he holds the
[1:04:31] seven stars
[1:04:33] in his hands to think that tonight that
[1:04:35] that god
[1:04:36] is in control of all things and to think
[1:04:38] that tonight
[1:04:39] that he was holding those seven
[1:04:41] messengers in
[1:04:43] his hands now to realize that this god
[1:04:45] has got this message in control
[1:04:47] you ain't got to hold this message up
[1:04:50] he's got it right in his hands
[1:04:52] he's so in control of this message he's
[1:04:54] so in control
[1:04:56] that he's gonna make sure that you make
[1:04:58] it through satan's eden
[1:05:00] and you make it over into a rapture into
[1:05:02] a perfect paradise
[1:05:04] into a place that never knew no age
[1:05:07] never knew no turmoil never knew no
[1:05:09] things of sicknesses and
[1:05:11] all kinds of things he's
[1:05:14] not walking away but he's walking right
[1:05:17] in the midst
[1:05:18] of the golden candlesticks this god as
[1:05:22] job would say in job 23-10
[1:05:24] he knoweth the way that i take and when
[1:05:28] i will come forth i will come forth
[1:05:30] as gold
[1:05:33] this god's got you tonight look at your
[1:05:36] neighbors say this god's got you
[1:05:39] his name is jesus hallelujah
[1:05:43] but you begin to look at the things that
[1:05:46] that have happened to the children of
[1:05:48] god and you begin to think back about
[1:05:50] all all that they go through and you
[1:05:52] look in hebrews 11
[1:05:53] and you can look through all the turmoil
[1:05:56] that they went through
[1:05:57] but they overcame by faith and you look
[1:06:00] at what
[1:06:01] has happened to the children of god and
[1:06:03] you begin to question in your mind you
[1:06:05] begin to look at
[1:06:06] is god really for this kind of people is
[1:06:09] god really
[1:06:10] on their side when you see the trials
[1:06:13] that they're put under
[1:06:14] when you look at the tests that they had
[1:06:16] to go through
[1:06:18] when you look at the battles that they
[1:06:19] had to come up against and
[1:06:21] and the circumstances that they've had
[1:06:23] to face you would begin to
[1:06:25] question is there a god that's on the
[1:06:28] side of these people
[1:06:29] are they just professing that there's a
[1:06:31] god for them are they just professing
[1:06:34] that the god of the messages is not dead
[1:06:37] and they didn't die in 1965
[1:06:39] and you begin to question well is there
[1:06:41] really a god that is on their side if
[1:06:46] there was no god on our side
[1:06:49] we wouldn't be standing in the midst and
[1:06:52] in the
[1:06:52] hour that we're standing in but because
[1:06:55] the lord
[1:06:56] was on my side
[1:07:00] have been crushed and i'd have crumbled
[1:07:02] a long time ago
[1:07:03] but because jesus had me he is the will
[1:07:06] in the middle of a will
[1:07:08] he is the rock of our salvation
[1:07:11] he is the rock in a weary trail in a
[1:07:14] wearing land
[1:07:15] he is the god that feeds you he's the
[1:07:17] god that feeds the sparrows
[1:07:19] how much more does he got you
[1:07:23] oh does he really get me does he really
[1:07:26] understand me
[1:07:28] i want to tell you he loves you he cares
[1:07:31] for you but do you care for him
[1:07:34] now now we we've heard this term
[1:07:37] to rise like a phoenix and a phoenix is
[1:07:40] a is a greek is a greek is a greek
[1:07:43] animal but to
[1:07:44] they there you've heard that that
[1:07:46] terminology to rise
[1:07:48] like a phoenix it means to rise
[1:07:51] from the ashes it means to emerge from a
[1:07:54] catastrophe or
[1:07:56] chaos and coming out stronger
[1:07:59] wiser more powerful we have a deeper
[1:08:02] understanding
[1:08:04] and you begin to look at the current
[1:08:05] climate of the things that we are
[1:08:08] under and the things that we are facing
[1:08:10] as a body of believers
[1:08:12] and it's astonishing to see that this is
[1:08:14] the drama
[1:08:16] that god almighty is holding in his
[1:08:18] hands
[1:08:20] he's directing every step of this he is
[1:08:23] controlling
[1:08:24] this great drama and there's nothing
[1:08:27] happening to you
[1:08:28] that he didn't know about god ain't
[1:08:30] having no bad hair day
[1:08:32] he's not shook up he's not messed up god
[1:08:35] is
[1:08:36] so he can't change so what he thought of
[1:08:38] you before the foundation of the world
[1:08:40] he is bringing it to pass but you begin
[1:08:44] to look at this great drama
[1:08:45] where here we are the children of the
[1:08:47] most high god you are the most powerful
[1:08:50] people
[1:08:51] on the face of the earth you have been
[1:08:53] given the greatest
[1:08:54] message that's ever been released on
[1:08:56] this earth but yet we're troubled on
[1:08:58] every side
[1:09:00] we receive battle after battle you look
[1:09:03] at the attack that's on the ministry
[1:09:05] of the son of man in this day you look
[1:09:07] at them they attack of
[1:09:09] of cancer on brother on you look at the
[1:09:11] attack of brain bleeds all on the pruitt
[1:09:13] family
[1:09:14] you look at brother jewel forney that's
[1:09:16] that's in the hospital
[1:09:18] and in the circumstances of strokes that
[1:09:20] has come by his way
[1:09:22] but this is the hour of the overcomer
[1:09:25] this is not the hour of pushovers but
[1:09:28] this
[1:09:28] is the hour when a people that have been
[1:09:30] ordained by god
[1:09:32] brother branham would say that he bred
[1:09:33] this one to that one
[1:09:35] and this one to that one until he got
[1:09:37] exactly what he wanted
[1:09:39] and he's looking for overcomers in this
[1:09:41] hour
[1:09:42] and overcomers are those faithful and
[1:09:45] obedient christians who not only talk
[1:09:47] about doing the will
[1:09:48] of god but they actually do the will of
[1:09:50] god
[1:09:51] if you could realize that you are
[1:09:53] ordained for
[1:09:54] this moment can i say that you are born
[1:09:57] for this battle you are born for such a
[1:10:00] time as this
[1:10:02] and there ain't nobody on earth that can
[1:10:04] take your place
[1:10:06] there ain't nobody that can take your
[1:10:08] place and even
[1:10:09] jesus said to him that i that overcometh
[1:10:13] will i grant to sit with me
[1:10:15] in my throne and in the message how can
[1:10:17] i overcome your prophet would say
[1:10:19] that the test is the greatest thing that
[1:10:22] ever happened to you
[1:10:29] sweet jesus in the message of power of
[1:10:31] god
[1:10:32] brother branham said he gives you a test
[1:10:37] he gives you a test and then comes to
[1:10:40] you
[1:10:40] when you're in that test
[1:10:45] oh hallelujah you may have woke up
[1:10:49] and you are in an utter crisis but he
[1:10:52] has come to you
[1:10:53] in your crisis he has come to you in
[1:10:56] your chaos
[1:10:57] your family may have had a mess up this
[1:11:00] week
[1:11:00] but he's coming to your family your
[1:11:03] family may have been strung out on drugs
[1:11:06] but he's come to your family your
[1:11:08] children may be
[1:11:09] somewhere off in sin but he's coming to
[1:11:12] your children
[1:11:15] you didn't buy a plane ticket in vain to
[1:11:17] come to a meeting
[1:11:18] god is coming to answer you to speak to
[1:11:22] you
[1:11:22] directly he is saying i have seen what
[1:11:25] you're going through
[1:11:26] i have seen the affliction of my
[1:11:28] children down there in egypt and i
[1:11:30] have come down
[1:11:34] to deliver and then he comes to you when
[1:11:38] you're in the test he said oh i like
[1:11:40] that don't you
[1:11:42] and he says the greatest experiences of
[1:11:44] my life
[1:11:45] is when i come up against a mountain
[1:11:47] that i can't get over it under it or
[1:11:49] grounded
[1:11:50] or around it and just stand still and
[1:11:53] god will
[1:11:54] move the thing back and he will move
[1:11:57] no matter how dark the cloud is faith
[1:12:00] pierces it yonder with an eye that looks
[1:12:03] beyond anything
[1:12:04] that the devil can set before you
[1:12:07] because god
[1:12:08] is our victory and so if you
[1:12:12] would know this that tonight that that
[1:12:14] your faith is piercing through the
[1:12:16] darkness
[1:12:17] of the clouds of chaos that have set up
[1:12:19] themselves about you
[1:12:21] and if you could realize this just in
[1:12:23] just to let your imagination
[1:12:25] loose just for a moment as you begin to
[1:12:27] think about the trials that you've been
[1:12:29] through
[1:12:29] that the enemy has set up all kinds of
[1:12:32] fires about you
[1:12:34] he set up all kinds of trash cans around
[1:12:36] about you
[1:12:37] and he threw he threw a he threw a
[1:12:39] lighter in there
[1:12:40] and he tried to create a burn barrel and
[1:12:43] he's tried to burn you
[1:12:45] with all kinds of things he's he's tried
[1:12:47] to he's tried to
[1:12:48] destroy you and burn you with with with
[1:12:51] all kinds of circumstances
[1:12:53] that laodicea has come against you he's
[1:12:56] tried to rob you of your family
[1:12:59] he's tried to rob you of your pastor
[1:13:01] he's tried to rob you of your health
[1:13:03] but the bible tells me over in the book
[1:13:05] of malachi and 4
[1:13:06] that the righteous shall walk out upon
[1:13:09] the ashes
[1:13:10] of the wicked so if you could realize
[1:13:12] this tonight
[1:13:13] that this god that's got you he's not
[1:13:16] just telling you that you are
[1:13:17] predetermined
[1:13:18] to make it through laodicea but you are
[1:13:21] predetermined
[1:13:22] over in the millennium to walk out upon
[1:13:24] the ashes
[1:13:25] of the one that tried to make you fall
[1:13:28] tried to rob you
[1:13:29] tried to steal from you try to shut down
[1:13:31] your family
[1:13:32] try to make you not a believer you will
[1:13:35] walk out
[1:13:36] upon the ashes ashes of the wicked
[1:13:39] that wicked one that transformed himself
[1:13:42] as an angel of light to try to tell you
[1:13:45] that he
[1:13:46] was the one that performed those acts
[1:13:48] you will walk
[1:13:49] out upon the ashes of the wicked and we
[1:13:52] will come out
[1:13:53] like the three hebrew children they
[1:13:55] didn't have a smell
[1:13:57] of the smoke of the flames upon them but
[1:13:59] they walked out upon the ashes
[1:14:01] with the son of man
[1:14:03] [Applause]
[1:14:09] oh hallelujah
[1:14:20] but in the moments of crisis and your
[1:14:23] mind begins to get relaxed and you begin
[1:14:25] to forget about the things
[1:14:27] who god is and you begin to think has
[1:14:31] god
[1:14:32] has god really lost control or is he
[1:14:35] letting some other agency or is he
[1:14:36] permitting some other agency
[1:14:38] to operate or to control these things
[1:14:40] but brother branham would say
[1:14:42] he would say in the god of this evil age
[1:14:44] he said that there are two
[1:14:46] opposing spirits that are a work in this
[1:14:48] day he said one of them
[1:14:50] is the devil's spirit his unclean spirit
[1:14:52] and
[1:14:53] one is the great holy spirit of god and
[1:14:55] there that
[1:14:56] opposing spirit is working in the way of
[1:14:59] deception
[1:15:00] but here god's holy spirit is calling
[1:15:03] out a bride for christ
[1:15:05] he is doing it by vindicating his word a
[1:15:08] promise to her
[1:15:09] for this age and showing that it is
[1:15:12] christ
[1:15:13] so if you could just get this in your
[1:15:15] picture or get this in your mind just
[1:15:17] now
[1:15:17] if you would look over and you could see
[1:15:20] the opposing spirit
[1:15:21] or look over into the enemy's camp you
[1:15:24] would look over there
[1:15:26] and shake him would think that he's got
[1:15:28] the upper hand on god's people
[1:15:30] but i want to warn the devil i want to
[1:15:33] warn the devil you're not winning
[1:15:35] and you don't have the upper hand upon
[1:15:37] us we won't be put up in a corner
[1:15:39] we won't be shut up we won't be left
[1:15:42] hanging on to the ropes
[1:15:43] we're not backing down we're not
[1:15:45] shutting up the only way that we can't
[1:15:48] win
[1:15:48] as the pride of jesus christ is if we
[1:15:51] switch
[1:15:52] sides and you got a better chance of the
[1:15:54] former president trump
[1:15:56] becoming the pope then you do got me
[1:15:58] switching sides
[1:15:59] and going over onto the devil's side i'm
[1:16:02] not
[1:16:02] moving off of my inheritance this
[1:16:06] is the lord's doing you may have been
[1:16:09] knocked down but you ain't been knocked
[1:16:10] out
[1:16:11] you are not defeated unless you begin
[1:16:14] to not get back up you are not the
[1:16:17] defeated
[1:16:17] you're the undefeated
[1:16:21] you've been through some stuff but every
[1:16:23] time we rise up a little bit higher
[1:16:28] charms come we just get stronger kovit
[1:16:32] came
[1:16:32] and we just got stronger cancer came and
[1:16:35] we just got stronger
[1:16:37] we rose up from the ashes of our despair
[1:16:41] and we begin to bless the name of the
[1:16:44] most
[1:16:44] high god
[1:16:49] hallelujah let the redeemed of the lord
[1:16:52] say so
[1:17:03] in the testimony of a true witness he
[1:17:04] said what an opportunity
[1:17:06] that the church of the living god has to
[1:17:08] rise to its feet
[1:17:10] with a witness of the baptism of the
[1:17:12] holy ghost
[1:17:14] and to shake this world what an
[1:17:16] opportunity that you've been given
[1:17:18] you thought that what you were going
[1:17:20] through was just a minor setback but i
[1:17:22] want to tell you
[1:17:23] it is a set up for the enemy for the
[1:17:26] enemy doesn't know what's coming
[1:17:28] and god is going to take you to
[1:17:29] something higher come up here a little
[1:17:31] higher
[1:17:32] come on up here you weren't born for the
[1:17:34] chicken barn you were born to be an
[1:17:36] eagle
[1:17:37] and people think that they're going to
[1:17:39] stop this move of god
[1:17:40] but jesus said upon this rock i will
[1:17:43] build my church
[1:17:44] and the gates of hell shall not prevail
[1:17:46] against it
[1:17:47] you could say you're going to stop my
[1:17:48] pastor but you could better stop the sun
[1:17:51] and a whole lot quicker could you stop
[1:17:53] it than to stop
[1:17:55] what god has already ordained and set in
[1:17:58] order
[1:17:58] when he set the sun to hold in that
[1:18:00] position and the moon to stay in its
[1:18:02] position
[1:18:03] so that it holds back the ways of the
[1:18:06] ocean
[1:18:07] you can't move us off of our promises
[1:18:09] because we
[1:18:10] are protecting the rest of this world
[1:18:13] before the tribulation
[1:18:16] but when he begins to lift the moon
[1:18:19] and the moon begins to shine there you
[1:18:21] will watch the wrath of god pour it out
[1:18:24] but until that time this world's going
[1:18:26] to live in peace
[1:18:27] this world's going to have prosper
[1:18:30] they're going to have success
[1:18:31] because the bride of jesus christ is
[1:18:34] still here
[1:18:44] how it must kill satan
[1:18:48] he must get so
[1:18:51] so war slap out
[1:18:57] because every time he thinks he's got a
[1:18:58] death blow on us
[1:19:01] we rise back up
[1:19:07] this ain't some whack-a-mole game that
[1:19:09] you play in the arcade
[1:19:11] well you got a gra you got a great big
[1:19:13] hammer in your hand
[1:19:14] and you try to hit that thing every time
[1:19:16] it comes up i want you to know it feels
[1:19:18] like he is working on your head
[1:19:20] but you still keep getting back up
[1:19:24] you're greater than some you're greater
[1:19:26] than some game
[1:19:27] you're greater than some mole you are
[1:19:29] greater
[1:19:30] you're greater than what's even seen in
[1:19:32] this building tonight
[1:19:33] and if you could look past what is even
[1:19:36] being seen
[1:19:37] in this realm right now there is a
[1:19:39] pillar of fire that's going to make sure
[1:19:41] that the enemy is defeated and you come
[1:19:44] out on the top
[1:19:46] are you with me this is what brother
[1:19:47] branham said that this
[1:19:49] in this age is another ephesians what
[1:19:51] we're coming out of
[1:19:53] and we're going into we have come out of
[1:19:55] every intellectual conception
[1:19:57] and we have come out of all their
[1:19:59] educational programs
[1:20:00] but this is an exodus where we move out
[1:20:03] of egypt
[1:20:04] right into the rapture of the bride of
[1:20:07] jesus christ
[1:20:08] for this we are going to our future home
[1:20:11] with our future and heavenly bridegroom
[1:20:18] what is it god
[1:20:21] is making sure you're going to come out
[1:20:25] he could have chose some other way to
[1:20:26] come but he came
[1:20:28] the way of the unwanted
[1:20:31] he came to those that were rejected by
[1:20:34] society
[1:20:35] but he came to a little girl by the name
[1:20:38] of mary
[1:20:39] because she was the elect of god he
[1:20:41] could have chose something
[1:20:42] else they could have came another way
[1:20:44] but he took the lowest
[1:20:48] he took the lowest way brother maram
[1:20:51] said in the paradox
[1:20:53] he said a phoenix is something that can
[1:20:56] raise up
[1:20:57] out of nothing and that's what god does
[1:20:59] he takes
[1:21:00] nothing and raises up something out of
[1:21:03] it
[1:21:04] and he says my message this afternoon
[1:21:07] it's
[1:21:07] titled for the next 30 or 45 minutes
[1:21:10] a paradox and to think that tonight
[1:21:14] that you are the people that's rising
[1:21:16] out of
[1:21:17] something that this god has taken what
[1:21:20] was
[1:21:20] nothing in the world and the church of
[1:21:23] the living god is a true paradox
[1:21:25] she's a complete paradox it's something
[1:21:27] that's hard to believe
[1:21:29] but yet it's true
[1:21:32] it's true you may look upon your life
[1:21:34] and look past your family history and
[1:21:36] look down through the things that you
[1:21:38] come through
[1:21:39] it's it's unexplainable how you got here
[1:21:43] and the enemy has whispered lies in your
[1:21:46] ears
[1:21:46] all of your life and telling you that
[1:21:48] you weren't good enough
[1:21:50] told you that you never lived this
[1:21:51] message that you're that your daddy just
[1:21:54] your daddy wasn't no good so you won't
[1:21:56] be no good but i want to tell you that
[1:21:57] the
[1:21:58] lord our god that is on our side
[1:22:01] it is here to prove that this devil is a
[1:22:04] liar
[1:22:07] he's here to prove that that everything
[1:22:10] that the enemy has stacked up against
[1:22:12] you
[1:22:12] is wrong and you can line up your list
[1:22:15] that the enemy has whispered in your
[1:22:17] ears just this past week
[1:22:20] you shouldn't be here there's no way
[1:22:23] that you should have made it through
[1:22:24] that car accident
[1:22:26] there's no way that that you you be
[1:22:28] called the elect of the most high god
[1:22:30] there's no way they're just another
[1:22:33] people
[1:22:34] they're just another church with another
[1:22:36] spin on things they
[1:22:37] they they they're they're they're just
[1:22:39] they're not strong enough
[1:22:41] they're just they're just another people
[1:22:43] they're not they're not good enough
[1:22:44] they're not qualified they don't have
[1:22:46] enough education
[1:22:47] but i beg to differ my seed on the
[1:22:49] inside of me tells me different
[1:22:53] they say i shouldn't be here maybe i
[1:22:55] shouldn't have been in there
[1:22:56] in their categories or by their results
[1:22:58] but by
[1:22:59] the work of the lord he says that we are
[1:23:02] his
[1:23:02] workmanship and it's not
[1:23:06] a works that we should boast but this is
[1:23:08] what he pre-planned
[1:23:10] you can look all over this building
[1:23:12] tonight and i'm sure you can look all
[1:23:13] over edmonton
[1:23:14] there's a lot of people that should not
[1:23:15] be sitting in the building
[1:23:18] you can't see him on the way by the
[1:23:20] airway of the internet but he's helping
[1:23:22] making this
[1:23:22] he's helped making this progress or this
[1:23:24] sermon come to pass this evening he's
[1:23:26] sitting behind a computer tonight
[1:23:28] his name is jeremy diaz there's no
[1:23:31] reasoning power
[1:23:32] that would make jeremy diaz set in this
[1:23:34] building you don't know the ashes that
[1:23:36] he had to walk out of
[1:23:38] as a family member to be sitting here
[1:23:40] there was no family ties to this church
[1:23:43] there was nobody that called him here
[1:23:45] grew up away from us
[1:23:46] but god that was rich in mercy had
[1:23:49] predetermined his destiny that he'd be
[1:23:51] sitting here
[1:23:52] and one of the reason why edmonton can
[1:23:54] hear this service tonight
[1:23:55] is because there's a jeremy diaz sitting
[1:23:58] at full gospel lighthouse
[1:24:00] how many more names could we call
[1:24:01] tonight how about gabrielle bordevar
[1:24:04] she shouldn't be here william barlivard
[1:24:06] shouldn't be
[1:24:07] here but god that was rich in mercy
[1:24:12] you shouldn't be here by the devil's
[1:24:15] thoughts but god's thoughts
[1:24:16] that you are here before the foundation
[1:24:19] of the world
[1:24:20] you're not just here you're on the other
[1:24:22] side
[1:24:25] i had a whole stack of things that was
[1:24:27] against me but against
[1:24:29] all hearts i'm still standing
[1:24:34] ron spencer had a line of things against
[1:24:36] him
[1:24:37] but against all odds we're still
[1:24:42] standing
[1:24:46] what is it it's a transfer of power that
[1:24:49] which was in his mind
[1:24:50] is now in the body of jesus christ
[1:24:54] brother bradham said now i will transfer
[1:24:56] the words to your mouth to overcome
[1:24:58] the enemy that is what has happened in
[1:25:01] this day
[1:25:02] we have received a message of malachi 4
[1:25:04] that's restored our faith back
[1:25:07] to the faith of the pentecostal fathers
[1:25:09] it's a transfer of power
[1:25:11] it's not something for paul and for
[1:25:13] peter it's the church of the living god
[1:25:16] that will rise up out of the ashes of
[1:25:18] laodicea
[1:25:19] [Applause]
[1:25:23] you shouldn't be here you shouldn't be
[1:25:27] here you shouldn't be here esther you
[1:25:29] shouldn't be here
[1:25:32] esther there's no way you could rise to
[1:25:34] power like that you shouldn't be here
[1:25:36] oh really oh really
[1:25:40] what happened it was a transfer of power
[1:25:44] there's a transfer of power you might
[1:25:47] have to dust yourself off from all the
[1:25:48] ashes
[1:25:49] you don't sit on that heap for a long
[1:25:51] time but it's time to dust yourself off
[1:25:53] of it
[1:25:54] [Applause]
[1:25:57] you shouldn't be here oh oh but the
[1:26:01] lord's on my side
[1:26:04] there's a whole line of things in your
[1:26:06] dna that tells me
[1:26:07] you should abundant dead you were
[1:26:10] unwanted
[1:26:11] you were irrelevant you were you were
[1:26:14] not elected
[1:26:15] by whose standards here this little girl
[1:26:18] by the name of esther which was an
[1:26:21] unknown jewish
[1:26:22] girl her mother and her father done
[1:26:24] passed away
[1:26:25] she was raised in the house of her
[1:26:26] cousin mordecai
[1:26:29] but there because there was a
[1:26:32] denominational woman
[1:26:33] that would not come into the court of
[1:26:35] the king there went out a decree
[1:26:38] let a hazarist has a wife let him have a
[1:26:41] wife that'll come before him
[1:26:43] and they sent out men and they were
[1:26:45] looking for fair maidens and virgins of
[1:26:47] the land
[1:26:48] and the bible said in esther chapter 2
[1:26:51] that the king loved esther more than any
[1:26:54] other woman
[1:26:54] and he took the royal crown and he
[1:26:57] placed it upon her head
[1:26:58] that she would be the queen instead of
[1:27:01] vasti
[1:27:03] you shouldn't be here but god's got a
[1:27:06] purpose
[1:27:06] in you being here you thought you just
[1:27:10] showed up
[1:27:11] to this meeting out of some other way
[1:27:14] but god has a purpose
[1:27:16] in you being here because you see
[1:27:19] there is an enemy in the land that is
[1:27:22] raised up as an advisor to the king
[1:27:24] and he has swore out his threatenings
[1:27:26] that he
[1:27:27] would make all the jews bow before him
[1:27:31] but there was this some as we would say
[1:27:34] in virginia there was some rough neck by
[1:27:37] the name of
[1:27:37] mordecai that said i will not bow before
[1:27:40] some false god or some adversary
[1:27:42] or some adviser are you with me
[1:27:46] i'm not going to bow before him but i
[1:27:47] will only bow before the true
[1:27:49] and living god and here mordecai
[1:27:51] wouldn't bow
[1:27:53] and because haman got so upset
[1:27:56] he went in before the king and he
[1:27:58] plotted out to an
[1:27:59] aide to eliminate all of the jews
[1:28:03] that were in the land you shouldn't be
[1:28:06] here esther
[1:28:08] there's no way that you should be here
[1:28:10] you're unwanted you're unknown your
[1:28:12] mother and your father's died
[1:28:14] but esther this is your time you
[1:28:16] shouldn't be here
[1:28:17] that's what the devil said but this is
[1:28:19] your time
[1:28:21] you walked into this service because
[1:28:23] it's your time
[1:28:25] it's your time to be healed
[1:28:28] it's your time to be delivered of
[1:28:29] alcohol it's your time to be a deliverer
[1:28:32] of lust and the abuse of the enemy it's
[1:28:35] your time
[1:28:38] the enemy's time is over but this is
[1:28:39] your time
[1:28:42] i want you to know haman had a death a
[1:28:45] death worn upon him
[1:28:46] and he thought that he was living at the
[1:28:48] height of his kingdom but he didn't
[1:28:50] realize in a few days
[1:28:51] he'd be hanging
[1:28:54] you be careful who you hang out with
[1:28:58] you could be hanging out with haman but
[1:29:00] here
[1:29:01] because of haman's plot to to to destroy
[1:29:04] and he got
[1:29:05] he wanted revenge because mordecai
[1:29:07] wouldn't bow before him
[1:29:09] but esther you shouldn't be here
[1:29:12] but you're here to save your people from
[1:29:16] the plot of haman
[1:29:17] of being high eliminated how many times
[1:29:20] have i heard that throughout my life
[1:29:22] you're going to be eliminated
[1:29:23] you'll never be good enough you you're
[1:29:25] not strong enough
[1:29:26] you're gonna be you're gonna be cast off
[1:29:28] the scene you'll never be
[1:29:30] you'll never be but there mordecai
[1:29:33] whispered through the answers or through
[1:29:36] the people that would get the message
[1:29:38] to esther hear mordecai's whispering out
[1:29:40] these things
[1:29:41] he says to esther he said you have come
[1:29:45] to the mountain for such a time as this
[1:29:48] and notice what he says
[1:29:49] in esther 4 and 14 he said if you all
[1:29:52] together hold us
[1:29:54] thy peace at this time then there shall
[1:29:57] be there and there an enlargement and
[1:29:59] deliverance arise
[1:30:01] to the jews from another place so what
[1:30:04] is god
[1:30:04] saying to you that if you don't serve me
[1:30:07] i'm gonna raise somebody else up the
[1:30:08] wheel
[1:30:10] if you don't get up out of your cold
[1:30:13] formal ideologies
[1:30:15] and think you're just gonna make it i'm
[1:30:17] gonna raise up somebody
[1:30:19] i'm going to bring a deliverance because
[1:30:20] i want you to know
[1:30:22] i want you to know we can't be destroyed
[1:30:27] are you with me i'll he'll bring in an
[1:30:29] enlargement and a deliverance
[1:30:31] and a rise to the jews from another
[1:30:32] place but thou in thy father's house
[1:30:34] shall be destroyed
[1:30:36] and who knoweth whether thou art come to
[1:30:38] the kingdom
[1:30:39] for such a time as this
[1:30:42] here's a nobody she's unwanted
[1:30:46] let me put it to you like this maybe you
[1:30:48] are esther
[1:30:49] and you've got a family history when
[1:30:51] your mother and your father done passed
[1:30:53] away
[1:30:53] you've been raised outside of the house
[1:30:55] and you said you never become the
[1:30:57] queen's wife
[1:31:00] you shouldn't be in this position but
[1:31:02] god ordained for you to be in this
[1:31:03] position
[1:31:04] so that you could rise up against the
[1:31:06] threats of the devil
[1:31:09] there's a lot of people that walked away
[1:31:10] because they couldn't handle the threats
[1:31:12] of the devil but there's a lady by the
[1:31:14] name of esther
[1:31:15] that rose up in the scripture that would
[1:31:17] not allow the whispers of the enemy
[1:31:19] to stop her people from being the people
[1:31:22] of the most high god
[1:31:24] you were you were by there by their ways
[1:31:27] unchosen
[1:31:28] unqualified not elected but here is a
[1:31:31] lady that shouldn't be
[1:31:32] here that was chosen to rise up and hang
[1:31:36] her enemy upon his own gallows
[1:31:39] now it's your time to turn the devil
[1:31:42] that's trying to turn you on your heels
[1:31:44] turn the devil's plans
[1:31:46] that are against you and turn them on
[1:31:48] him
[1:31:54] i'm not going to pretend to begin to
[1:31:56] think that i understand everything
[1:31:58] that's going on in edmonton
[1:31:59] i'm not going to begin to think that i
[1:32:00] understand all the all the
[1:32:03] stipulations that you've been under as a
[1:32:05] church there
[1:32:06] but i want you to know that the god that
[1:32:08] i'm serving that spends all these things
[1:32:11] is telling you to turn the devil's plans
[1:32:14] on him
[1:32:15] what he meant for evil god has used
[1:32:18] for his own good you thought that you
[1:32:22] were just shut up or the enemy thought
[1:32:23] that you were just shut up in your homes
[1:32:25] but you listen to more tapes
[1:32:27] than you ever listened to in all your
[1:32:28] life you heard more preaching you made
[1:32:31] more prayer time
[1:32:32] you spoke in tongues for the very first
[1:32:35] time in your life
[1:32:36] because you had time with god and you're
[1:32:39] not going to lose that relationship
[1:32:42] [Music]
[1:32:44] it's time that you turn the devil's
[1:32:46] plans on him
[1:32:50] it's time that we start telling cancer
[1:32:52] to get cancer and leave
[1:32:55] it's time we start telling the devil you
[1:32:57] manipulate your own cells
[1:32:59] you're not gonna have this body you
[1:33:01] manipulate your own schemes
[1:33:02] you're not gonna have ours you
[1:33:04] manipulate your own plans but you're not
[1:33:06] gonna have mine
[1:33:07] you manipulate your own family you're
[1:33:09] not gonna have my family
[1:33:10] you can try to destroy your own church
[1:33:12] and your own angels you're not gonna
[1:33:14] have god's angels
[1:33:16] you deceived a third in the beginning
[1:33:18] but here we are
[1:33:19] with two-thirds on our side get back
[1:33:22] satan
[1:33:26] there's more for us than there is
[1:33:28] against us
[1:33:32] it's time to turn it around it's time to
[1:33:36] take
[1:33:37] and walk out it's time to rise up
[1:33:40] it's time to stop sitting there a little
[1:33:43] boy he wasn't no he was
[1:33:44] he was unwanted he was irrelevant he was
[1:33:47] the eighth child
[1:33:48] he was not seen he smelled kind of funky
[1:33:51] smelled like a
[1:33:52] let smell like an animal even look like
[1:33:54] an animal
[1:33:55] but here he was on the back side of the
[1:33:58] desert
[1:33:59] back here kind of weird sitting back
[1:34:01] there talking to god making poems up
[1:34:04] and started singing about something that
[1:34:06] he knew of and he started saying
[1:34:08] the lord is my shepherd and i
[1:34:11] shall not want and yea
[1:34:15] though i walk through the valley of the
[1:34:17] shadow of death
[1:34:18] i will fear no evil
[1:34:22] surely goodness and mercy shall follow
[1:34:26] me
[1:34:26] all the days of my life an unwanted boy
[1:34:29] an irrelevant voice the eighth child of
[1:34:32] jesse
[1:34:33] was the one that god had chosen
[1:34:37] it was too much for him when he heard
[1:34:39] when he heard the boast of a philistine
[1:34:41] down there
[1:34:42] and he was to find the armies of the
[1:34:44] living god and he's coming to the calf
[1:34:46] and he was carrying some corn cakes over
[1:34:48] to his brothers and they thought well
[1:34:49] he'd just come down here to see the
[1:34:50] battle
[1:34:51] here he was carrying out the hidden
[1:34:53] manna that would get them over
[1:34:55] on the side of the philistines and make
[1:34:56] them the winners but they come down
[1:34:58] there and that threat fell
[1:35:00] on the ears of their own child on their
[1:35:02] own kind of a man
[1:35:04] he was ready he was he was a little he
[1:35:06] was he was a
[1:35:07] cute little boy to look at he knew how
[1:35:09] to play music
[1:35:10] he was unwanted by his brothers at this
[1:35:13] battle
[1:35:14] how many times have you been unwanted in
[1:35:16] the battle but you were the one that
[1:35:17] showed up
[1:35:20] you were the one that showed up when
[1:35:22] nobody else showed up when saul which
[1:35:24] would have been the man or should have
[1:35:25] been the man
[1:35:26] that took down this goliath he was back
[1:35:28] sitting in his tent because he was all
[1:35:30] afraid
[1:35:31] you showed up i want to tell the devil
[1:35:35] and put him on notice there's david
[1:35:37] sitting all over the bride of jesus
[1:35:38] christ
[1:35:39] and we have showed up to rise out upon
[1:35:42] the ashes of the philistines
[1:35:44] [Applause]
[1:35:48] what did he do he went down there and
[1:35:51] the prophet said he picked up j-e-s-u-s
[1:35:54] and as brother wayne lawson said that's
[1:35:56] the best thing you can do in a fight
[1:35:57] is pick up jesus i got jesus on my side
[1:36:01] who you got on your side
[1:36:03] and here david goes down there and he
[1:36:07] takes the live sword
[1:36:08] and he cuts off his own head but you
[1:36:11] remember
[1:36:12] when david when david was running from
[1:36:14] saul
[1:36:15] some few chapters backwards that you
[1:36:17] remember that he's running away from
[1:36:19] saul
[1:36:19] and he didn't have time to grab a sword
[1:36:21] or to grab a spear
[1:36:22] but he went up there to the priest house
[1:36:25] and he said is there any sword or is
[1:36:26] there any spear here
[1:36:28] he said the only sword that's here is
[1:36:30] the sword of goliath
[1:36:31] and david said give it to me there's
[1:36:34] none like it
[1:36:35] what i'm saying to you is that what's
[1:36:37] the enemy built to destroy you
[1:36:39] you are now taking it and destroying and
[1:36:42] cutting his head off
[1:36:44] [Applause]
[1:36:46] i'm telling you to turn the plans on the
[1:36:48] devil
[1:36:50] i'm telling you that which was meant for

[1:38:27] on the field oh she's a little flock
[1:38:28] but brother god's with her she's going
[1:38:31] to try up
[1:38:32] just as certain as christ rose from the
[1:38:34] dead god's church shall never fail
[1:38:37] the gates of hell shall not prevail it's
[1:38:39] so they be against it
[1:38:41] but they cannot prevail the church is
[1:38:43] going to triumph
[1:38:44] through the blood of jesus christ to the
[1:38:46] victory march
[1:38:47] i'm positive of this one thing this is a
[1:38:51] prophet of god
[1:38:52] he said i'm positive of this one thing
[1:38:55] that god will have a church
[1:38:57] that's without spot without blemish
[1:39:00] without wrinkle or blemish and i'm so
[1:39:02] happy about that
[1:39:04] [Applause]
[1:39:05] hallelujah you can point at all the
[1:39:07] ashes that are around you
[1:39:09] but i want to tell you there's no
[1:39:10] challenge too great there's no failure
[1:39:13] too bad
[1:39:14] there's no enemy too strong for we
[1:39:17] are more than conquerors through him
[1:39:19] that loved us
[1:39:20] there is no dream too big there is no
[1:39:23] hope to a dashes
[1:39:24] there is no task to impossible for we
[1:39:27] can do all things through him who loved
[1:39:31] us
[1:39:31] [Music]
[1:39:35] what am i telling you what am i telling
[1:39:38] you i'm telling you that you
[1:39:40] are the church of the most high god
[1:39:43] and satan is scared of you
[1:39:47] satan's scared of you and what he's
[1:39:49] trying to do is to keep you
[1:39:51] from your potentials and who you're
[1:39:53] meant to be the ashes are what you're
[1:39:55] going to walk on
[1:39:58] now notice in the program in church age
[1:40:00] he said the members
[1:40:02] of the virgin bride will love him and
[1:40:04] they will have his potentials
[1:40:06] for he is their head and all power
[1:40:09] belongs to him
[1:40:11] they are subject to him as the members
[1:40:13] of our bodies are subject to our heads
[1:40:16] but notice the harmony of the father and
[1:40:18] the son he said jesus never did anything
[1:40:21] until it was first showed him by the
[1:40:22] father in john 5
[1:40:24] 19 he said this harmony is now to exist
[1:40:27] between the groom
[1:40:28] and his bride he shows her his word of
[1:40:31] life
[1:40:32] she receives it she never doubts it
[1:40:38] there nothing can harm her not even
[1:40:40] death for if the seed be planted
[1:40:42] the water will raise it up again and
[1:40:46] here
[1:40:46] is the secret of this the word is in the
[1:40:49] bride
[1:40:50] as it was in mary the bride has the mind
[1:40:54] of christ
[1:40:54] for she knows she knows
[1:40:58] she knows what he wants done with the
[1:41:00] word
[1:41:01] she performs the command of the word in
[1:41:03] his name for
[1:41:04] she has thus saith the lord
[1:41:11] she has thus saith the lord
[1:41:15] the bible tells us that we are created
[1:41:17] in his image
[1:41:19] that we carry and bear the image of the
[1:41:21] most high god
[1:41:22] and here here we know that the mind
[1:41:25] is the womb for the spirit and the
[1:41:28] prophet would tell us
[1:41:29] that the angel told him that your
[1:41:31] thoughts are louder in heaven
[1:41:33] than your voice is here on earth
[1:41:36] so whatsoever things are pure whatsoever
[1:41:40] things are lovely
[1:41:41] whatsoever things are just whatsoever
[1:41:44] things will be a good report
[1:41:45] to think on these things
[1:41:49] there is power in your thoughts and i
[1:41:52] want to put in your thoughts just now
[1:41:54] that you as the bride of jesus christ
[1:41:57] were given power
[1:41:58] to bind that serpent he said whatsoever
[1:42:02] you bind on earth
[1:42:03] shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever
[1:42:05] you loose on earth
[1:42:06] shall be loosed in heaven he is running
[1:42:09] after your brother
[1:42:10] but you've been given power to bind that
[1:42:12] mamba
[1:42:13] in the name of jesus christ don't you
[1:42:15] fear to go anywhere
[1:42:17] or to do anything for the never failing
[1:42:19] presence
[1:42:20] of them lord jesus christ is with you
[1:42:23] wherever you go

[1:42:29] of your crisis

[1:42:32] right here
[1:42:33] in the midst of this generation like
[1:42:35] never before
[1:42:37] we have seen him rise in power we have
[1:42:40] seen him move
[1:42:41] in power and in demonstration
[1:42:45] he's the god of this bible and he's
[1:42:47] backed up
[1:42:48] every one of his words
[1:42:51] we've seen that was har which was hard
[1:42:53] cases for the doctors
[1:42:56] we've seen him turn it around
[1:43:00] because we're not paul and we're not
[1:43:02] jesus but he's still jesus
[1:43:05] but i'm still his bride he's still god
[1:43:09] on the throne

[1:43:14] we're going to get out of it
[1:43:16] you can try to feed us through the lines
[1:43:18] but we're going we're going to shut up
[1:43:19] the mouth of the lines
[1:43:21] you can try to kill us but it won't come
[1:43:23] near us
[1:43:25] you can try to stop us but we'll keep
[1:43:27] going on you cry you could try to shut
[1:43:29] us up but we'll keep talking

[1:46:47] but you are anointed with the mighty
[1:46:49] angel anointing
[1:46:51] of revelations chapter 10 and every word
[1:46:54] and every promise is in your mouth
[1:46:58] it's a time that you go take the book
[1:47:01] and eat the book
[1:47:02] you have become the book thou must
[1:47:05] prophesy
[1:47:06] to kings and the priests son of man can
[1:47:09] these bones live again
[1:47:10] thou knowest start speaking that what
[1:47:13] you want to see
[1:47:14] rise up above it
[1:47:20] you should have never been here you
[1:47:23] should have never been here
[1:47:24] but god was working everything out for
[1:47:26] your good
[1:47:27] there was a boy by the name of joseph he
[1:47:30] he rose up
[1:47:31] in the book of genesis and you see him
[1:47:33] rise up and he was a very gifted man he
[1:47:35] couldn't help who he was
[1:47:36] but there he got a vision from the lord
[1:47:39] and he's seen himself
[1:47:40] as standing out in the field and his
[1:47:42] brothers and his mother and his father
[1:47:44] bowing down before him and it's because
[1:47:47] because he told these things the
[1:47:48] brothers thought that he was better than
[1:47:50] them
[1:47:50] and so they cast him down into a pit and
[1:47:53] told the father
[1:47:54] that he had died and been eaten and been
[1:47:56] destroyed by by
[1:47:57] by a wild beast and they took him and
[1:47:59] they sold him to the egyptians
[1:48:01] and the egyptians sowed in the potiphar
[1:48:03] and potiphar seen the gift
[1:48:05] that was in joseph his life and he
[1:48:07] watched him and he gave him liberty
[1:48:09] and he rise up and we know the story
[1:48:12] that before long that liberty was stole
[1:48:14] from him
[1:48:15] and there he was put into a prison
[1:48:18] all the while you're thinking i
[1:48:21] shouldn't be here
[1:48:23] i shouldn't be in this i shouldn't be in
[1:48:24] this condition i shouldn't be here
[1:48:27] i i don't deserve this that vision's
[1:48:30] laying before you all the time
[1:48:32] that there that that there's gonna be a
[1:48:33] throne that you're gonna set on
[1:48:36] down in prison i believe joseph could
[1:48:38] hold that vision before him
[1:48:40] and he could say that i am going to sit
[1:48:43] on the throne
[1:48:44] and i want to tell you that if you're
[1:48:45] sitting in the prison house
[1:48:47] of the enemy that he's trying to put you
[1:48:49] in god's made a way for you to get out
[1:48:51] of that thing
[1:48:53] you see because what you don't look at
[1:48:55] what you're looking at is walls
[1:48:56] but there's something on the inside of
[1:48:58] you joseph that you are the son of
[1:49:00] prosperity
[1:49:01] and you're gonna come out of that prison
[1:49:03] you're gonna make everything work right
[1:49:05] in that prison
[1:49:06] you're gonna tell dreams and people
[1:49:08] somebody's gonna remember
[1:49:09] that you're down there oh i'm so glad
[1:49:12] that somebody
[1:49:13] remembered me when i was down there in a
[1:49:15] prison house
[1:49:17] they said hey there's a joseph down
[1:49:19] there he's got something that we need up
[1:49:21] here in this kingdom
[1:49:25] he's got something that we need oh
[1:49:28] church of the living god i want to tell
[1:49:31] you you got something that we need
[1:49:33] we can't make this without you we can't

[1:49:53] here he is here he is he rises
[1:49:56] because those potentials were laying on
[1:49:58] the inside of him
[1:49:59] those potentials are laying there when
[1:50:01] they wasn't being seen by the world
[1:50:04] your potentials couldn't be shown down
[1:50:05] there in the prison

[1:50:12] let it rise up let it rise up
[1:50:18] i want to tell you don't you ever
[1:50:21] underestimate our young people
[1:50:26] hell messed up a long time ago when they
[1:50:28] when they underestimated some young
[1:50:30] people
[1:50:32] they underestimated daniel they
[1:50:34] underestimated
[1:50:35] they underestimated the three hebrew
[1:50:37] children they underestimated david
[1:50:39] but they come out on top and i want to
[1:50:41] tell you church of the living god you
[1:50:43] might be elders in the church but don't
[1:50:45] you ever underestimate the youth in our
[1:50:47] church
[1:50:48] they are not the church of tomorrow they
[1:50:50] are the church
[1:50:51] of today and if they have not received
[1:50:54] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:50:55] the holy ghost is for them and i believe
[1:50:58] that by the word of the lord
[1:51:00] that the bible tells us that while peter
[1:51:02] yet spoke these words
[1:51:03] the holy ghost fell on him don't you
[1:51:05] underestimate the power
[1:51:07] of this scurry of this service don't you
[1:51:10] be discouraged in this moment
[1:51:12] the holy ghost is here
[1:51:15] and he's here giving you a walkway to
[1:51:19] rise out
[1:51:20] and walk upon the ashes of the wicket
[1:51:24] satan be careful be careful
[1:51:28] church of the living god do you know
[1:51:30] where you stand
[1:51:31] you've been predestinated and satan's
[1:51:34] been predestinated
[1:51:36] there is a time of torment that is
[1:51:38] coming by his way
[1:51:39] he's tried to stop us he's tried to
[1:51:42] hinder us
[1:51:43] but now in christ jesus we who were of
[1:51:46] aliens
[1:51:47] and are sometimes far off
[1:51:52] hallelujah you weren't even wanting it
[1:51:58] you shouldn't even been in this meeting
[1:52:03] you shouldn't be in the service
[1:52:06] your mama and daddy should have never
[1:52:08] brought you here
[1:52:13] you shouldn't be here but joseph
[1:52:17] keep that vision before you
[1:52:20] keep that vision before you and if we
[1:52:23] can only keep that in our mind
[1:52:25] and according to the word of the lord
[1:52:27] that in these last days he's going to
[1:52:29] have a church
[1:52:30] he's going to have a people and these
[1:52:33] things that he's promised
[1:52:34] he is going to do them
[1:52:37] [Music]
[1:52:39] he's going to bring you out of this and
[1:52:41] he's going to make a way there when
[1:52:42] there seems to be no way
[1:52:44] and i'm going to be like the psalmist
[1:52:46] said in psalms 119 and 62
[1:52:49] at midnight i will rise to give thanks
[1:52:53] unto thee
[1:52:53] because of thy righteous judgments it's
[1:52:56] darkness upon the face of the earth
[1:52:58] but it's a time that the church of the
[1:53:00] living god starts rising
[1:53:02] to give thanks because of his goodness
[1:53:06] shake the dust off of you

[1:53:38] dust of their life
[1:53:40] it is when that person is setting it's
[1:53:42] an expression
[1:53:43] and a depiction of somebody that is in
[1:53:46] mourning
[1:53:47] just like when job was sitting there for
[1:53:49] seven days and seven nights
[1:53:51] he'd been sitting there grieving and
[1:53:52] nobody would go and talk to him
[1:53:54] because his grief was that great and
[1:53:56] jerusalem

[1:54:36] self-filth and to set back down in that

[1:59:22] brother vernon you shouldn't be here
[1:59:24] ed hammer meister you shouldn't be there
[1:59:28] brother harold hildebrand you should
[1:59:29] have been gone a long time ago you
[1:59:31] shouldn't be here
[1:59:32] what is it it's a big burnover and
[1:59:35] there's a bunch of stately plans that
[1:59:37] will not worship the lord our god
[1:59:39] but there is something coming up under
[1:59:41] the undergrowth
[1:59:43] that wind when it began to move over
[1:59:45] those pines
[1:59:46] they began to groan and moan like a
[1:59:49] bunch of dead cold formal churches
[1:59:51] but there was an undergrowth that had
[1:59:53] come up what put that there
[1:59:55] the heat put that the heat put that
[1:59:59] there
[2:00:00] that seed can only come up when there's
[2:00:02] heat there
[2:00:04] but because of the fire there is an
[2:00:07] under brush
[2:00:08] yes they're green but there's life on
[2:00:10] the inside of them
[2:00:11] rise up and move to the move
[2:00:14] of the spirit of the living god
[2:00:16] [Applause]
[2:00:20] hallelujah it's a time to dust yourself
[2:00:24] you can put ashes on your head you can
[2:00:26] just sit there in your
[2:00:27] self-pity you can wallow in your crisis
[2:00:30] you can water in your circumstances
[2:00:32] but he's telling you to shake off the
[2:00:34] dust and to arise to the place that i
[2:00:36] destined you to
[2:00:41] i always wondered as the musicians come
[2:00:43] i always wondered
[2:00:46] when those jews over in the homeland
[2:00:50] when they go there to the weeping wall
[2:00:54] and you know you know what i'm referring
[2:00:55] to when they'd go there before the
[2:00:57] weeping wall it's the last standing part
[2:00:59] of the wall
[2:01:00] of the original that solomon built in
[2:01:02] that day
[2:01:04] and they they stand there and they they
[2:01:06] they quote scriptures and they
[2:01:08] and they write down their prayer
[2:01:09] requests and they and they stand before
[2:01:11] that
[2:01:12] that wailing wall and they start
[2:01:14] repeating those scriptures and repeating
[2:01:16] those prayers
[2:01:17] and they're sitting there and they're
[2:01:18] rocking if you watch them they're
[2:01:20] sitting there rocking back and forth
[2:01:22] they're rocking back and forth in front
[2:01:24] of that wall and the concept i always
[2:01:26] wondered
[2:01:27] what was the point of them rocking back
[2:01:29] and forth but the concept of them
[2:01:31] rocking
[2:01:32] is to do like the priests would do when
[2:01:34] he would spray the blood
[2:01:36] upon the sacrifice he would rock himself
[2:01:39] and so the worshiper is there before
[2:01:42] that weeping wall that wailing wall
[2:01:44] and they're working themselves back and
[2:01:46] forth because a sacrifice has been paid
[2:01:49] and they realize that they're walking
[2:01:51] and so they're rocking back and forth
[2:01:54] because they
[2:01:54] think and they realize that the god of
[2:01:58] heaven is moving
[2:01:59] and they've got to move as the god of
[2:02:02] heaven moves
[2:02:03] so they're rocking back and forth and
[2:02:05] they're saying those scriptures
[2:02:07] and we're rocking back and forth and
[2:02:09] saying we're more than cockroach
[2:02:11] there's no weapon that's formed against
[2:02:13] us what are we doing
[2:02:15] we are moving as the god of heaven moves
[2:02:18] and brother branham said that when god
[2:02:20] moves in the spirit
[2:02:22] his children move with it
[2:02:28] hallelujah what are you doing i'm moving
[2:02:30] with a god that's moving
[2:02:32] and one of these days he's going to move
[2:02:34] me from this realm
[2:02:35] into that round this mortal's going to
[2:02:39] put on immortality
[2:02:40] and this corruption is going to put on
[2:02:44] incorruption
[2:02:46] i don't know what to think about that
[2:02:47] brother andrew neither did a prophet one
[2:02:49] time
[2:02:50] he thought i didn't know what to think
[2:02:51] about that dance dancing was just out in
[2:02:54] the world
[2:02:54] he said but i found out that the enemy
[2:02:57] came in
[2:02:57] and stole the real dance from the
[2:02:59] victory of the children of god
[2:03:02] and dancing is a sign of victory
[2:03:05] and i'm telling you that it's a time to
[2:03:08] rise up from your ashes
[2:03:10] you may not know how to dance just like
[2:03:12] david dance but just rock yourself back
[2:03:15] and forth to sleep
[2:03:16] in the move of the holy spirit this is
[2:03:19] his door
[2:03:20] you're rising up out of it you can't see
[2:03:23] your way past it
[2:03:24] but he said i'm for you and if i'm for
[2:03:27] you
[2:03:27] who can be against you hear of god
[2:03:30] little children
[2:03:31] and greater is he that is in you than he
[2:03:34] that is in the world
[2:03:35] you just keep rocking because god is
[2:03:38] coming behind your dance
[2:03:39] with a victory praise and he's saying
[2:03:42] amen over your life
[2:03:46] i'm moving to the beat of the sheep
[2:03:48] music
[2:03:50] when the rest of the world is saying
[2:03:51] that the days of miracles have passed
[2:03:53] but the church of the living god is
[2:03:55] moving to the tune of the spirit
[2:03:56] and they shout out amen when the church
[2:03:59] says they ain't gonna make it
[2:04:00] you said you're gonna make it when the
[2:04:02] devil said you're not good enough
[2:04:04] you know you are good enough because
[2:04:06] there's a blood that's over you
[2:04:08] rise and shake yourself
[2:04:11] oh it's time to move if you could just
[2:04:14] look out
[2:04:15] david if you could just look out you're
[2:04:18] waiting
[2:04:19] you're waiting on something i hear the
[2:04:22] sound of it going
[2:04:25] i hear the sound of it going and the
[2:04:28] angels are moving over the mulberry
[2:04:30] trees
[2:04:30] just now your victory is right around
[2:04:34] your dance
[2:04:36] your victory is over top of those
[2:04:38] philistines
[2:04:39] your victory's over top of your family
[2:04:41] troubles
[2:04:43] you can't figure it out but i'm gonna
[2:04:45] tell you you just keep moving you just

[2:05:00] oh just let yourself loose and break
[2:05:02] forth into joy
