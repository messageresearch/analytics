later stood before our precious brother Henry green in a prayer line when when he prophesied over me like Peter Satan has desired to sift you over the years this song Slipped from my lips recently it's become real again in my heart the praise as I Sayang it recently at home an addition came to me and kind of added it at the end and I believe it touches many of us so perhaps we'll all praise Him amen as a child we were poor I saw days of gloom and I wept bitter teardrops alone in my room the Family Circle was broken by trouble and sin oh but Jesus H onto my hand oh Jesus Lord you held on to my hand oh giv me Comfort let only you can and you're more than a father a brother or friend oh Jesus held on to my hand at the old T Revival they were making the plee oh I join them and singing Lord

means a lot to me just because I feel like no matter what Trials come my way and even though I may not understand his plans for me I know I have a promise that he said he would never leave me nor forsake me and then even if I don't get all the answers to all my questions in this life I have a promise that he will see me I will see him on the other side of all this I never said that I would give you silver or gold or that you would never feel the fire or shiver in the cold but I did say you'd never walk through this world alone and I did say don't make this world your home I never said that fear wouldn't find you in the night or that loneliness was so you'd never have to fight but I did say I'd be right there by your [Music] side and I did say I'll always help you fight cuz you know I made a promise that I intend to keep my Grace will be sufficient in every time of need my love will be the anchor that you can hold on to this this is the [Music] promise this is the promise of made to you I never said that friends would never turn their backs on you or that the world around you wouldn't see you as a fool but I did say like me you'll surely be despised and I did [Music] say my ways confound the [Music] wiv I didn't say you never taste the bitter kiss of death or have to walk through Chile Jordan to enter into rest but I did say I'd be waiting right on the other side and I did say I'll try every tear you cry cuz you know I made a promise that I've prepared a place and someday sooner than you think you'll see me face to face and you'll sing with the angels in a countless multitude this is the promise this is the promise I've made to you so just keep on walking don't turn to the left or right and in the midst of Darkness let this be your light that hell can separate us

did they started that about 30 years 30 some years ago and it has grew and has grew and you know if it was just a gathering of people and that would just be another ProTrac of meeting but he's always came and done so many things and I could spend here the rest of the day and talk about the Miracles that I've seen happen there and uh we're just so thankful for what he's done Matthew Matthew was Matthew was at one of the we was at one of the meetings and he was a young man hadn't got married yet and we'd had to prayer line that night and somebody knocked on my door and after it was all over with and said we just carried Matthew we just carried well several of us carried Matthew carried him to the room and put him in his bed and he was speaking in tongues while he was being put in the bed and so hey those those things change our lives forever Hey listen if you've never met him just watch for that swirl of the Holy Spirit to come and that warm feeling to just come by near you you when it comes you just welcome him by and so we're just we're just so thankful for that amen we're just looking forward to great things this morning and asking the Lord to come by our way and and uh I just want to read a scripture for you and then I want to pray with Brother David and Sister Christina is that okay amen man if you will turn with me to Revelations 1 and verse 18 and then we'll go to ma Matthew chapter 28 and verse one on tell me again look at Thomas yes yes yes Thomas yes brother Thomas was doing some incredible suffering with his legs and his hips and his back and he came down and God touched him I tell you what when your back and hips hurt your whole body is in trouble and I'm so thankful for that maybe we can do some hunting this year together so amen and so amen sister Anna that was a phenomenal testimony I was sitting right right there since you told it last night it won't be me telling it so I was sitting right there and and uh her sister was down here at the altar and she Carly was down praying and the Lord spoke to me for something to tell her and uh and then to tell sister Anna and uh I didn't know what it all meant but tell her that it's a blockage it's a blockage and I told I told Carly and uh what was going on and then Anna was right beside of her praying and I said it's a blockage it's a blockage and I don't know the whole story but she went to the doctors to find out what the blockage was and it was a BL blockage to which that was holding her from getting pregnant and so they run the Dy up in it and they kept running the Dy in it and and uh they rolled her around and massaged her and all that different kind of thing and kept pressuring that with the die and it came open so today we can say it was a blockage I love it when it goes from it's a blockage to it was a blockage I once was blind but now I'm Healed I once was lame but now I'm Healed I once had cancer but now I'm Healed and Hallelujah we believe that with all of our hearts amen amen Revelations chap 1 and verse 18 powerful scripture right here maybe we could read this one together I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am alive forever more and have the keys of hell and of death Matthew chap 28 and verse 1 sorry to keep you standing but I'm going to stand for a while in the end of the Sabbath as it began to draw toward at the first day of the week Came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see The Seer and behold there was a great earthquake for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the Stone from the door and sat upon it and his countenance was like lightning and his rment was white as snow and for fear of him that the keepers did shake and became as dead men and the angels answered and said unto the woman fear not ye for I know that you seek Jesus which was crucified I love these next words he is not here for He Is Risen and he said come see the place where the Lord lay and go quickly and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead and behold he goeth before you into Galilee and there shall ye see him lo I have told you may have a need on your heart you just like to raise your hand before the Lord amen let's pray Lord Jesus why all of us could raise our hands we all want more of you Lord we're thankful to be in your house today and Lord it would be just a another meeting to be with friends and brothers and sisters if you don't come but we're already aware that you're here now Lord we ask you to anoint us you say our hands that went up there's needs behind every hand Lord I'm thankful that we can ask God and God hears it and not just that he hears it but he does something about it and we see the results that comes from it as brother Thomas just said my back that I'm Healed all he knew he knowed how much pain that he was in we watched the pain that he suffered Lord today we're so thankful for what you have done you prove that you're alive sister Anna the other day when she be to se send text and things that was testifying of what was going on through the day pray for me as I go through this procedure then afterwards we heard the incredible report now God you can come on the scene today and you you're a God that watches over us and you know how to deal with our hearts now Lord we ask you that you would minister to us today now Lord without you I'm no kind of a speaker but Lord I ask you that you would anoint our lips now Lord not just anoint the speaker lips but anoint the hearers today let us put aside what's to happen in this afternoon and tomorrow Lord just let us

so amen God bless you Sister Christina I've known you a long time amen you've came for a new start and I I don't I don't even want to know history because it don't matter it it absolutely don't matter God takes a book and the devil's got a lot of things against us and I'm amazed that he just rewrites the book he just kind of closes it and he rewrites it and it becomes a new chapter in your life and every time you feel that warm presence come near you just say Lord fill me more with your presence that's what we want to desire I'm going to pray that your move goes well and then you get the best jobs that that you've ever had in your life you you believe that I believe that let's just pray Lord Jesus what a mindful God that you are now Lord Jesus I'm praying that this move is a fresh start for them Lord not just to move to be among friends and family but they have felt something to leave another place and home and Friends they've come here for you I ask you that you'd fill their lives with the presence of God the Lord is as they move I pray that it goes smoothly Lord you guide us you open doors and closed doors as they look for jobs to be able to live here and sustain I ask you to give them the best jobs that they've ever had in their [Music] life and I believe you can and I believe if you will and Lord we thank you for these moments together in Jesus Christ name we pray amen and amen and amen amen God bless you God bless you God bless you enjoy the service amen amen amen hallelujah amen don't you love him isn't he good to us I want to speak to you on the indisputable it's a big word indisputable evidence of his resurrection we have an empty tomb we have an empty tomb that we can and point ourselves to brother brandom says he said now no matter how much he died and how pathetic his death was if there was no Resurrection he was just a man that died there has been many great men in our world that has made great claims for instance confusus the great Chinese philosopher died about 2300 years ago Buddha the great prophet of Japan also died around 2300 years ago and and made great statements but he died and he remains in the grave there was m Mohammad the privilege of being at his grave were 2,000 years the great white horse that has stood at his grave changing guards every four hours expecting him to rise someday and ride the world down and Conquer it muhammadans which is the greatest religion in number in the world they outnumber all Christians and Catholics put together but muhamad is still in the grave all of these religions when we say Jesus is raised from the dead I want to say to you he's alive he says and today we're trying to the religions are trying to keep Christ in a tomb oh what an Easter Morning has done an Easter cannot keep him in the Tomb you can put him in a Methodist tomb or a Baptist tomb or a presbyterian tomb or whatever you want to but he raised out of that tomb and he is alive today I had a Baptist tomb and you might have had a Methodist tomb but one day Jesus Rose from there notice how he says it from a historical God to a living and present God that is alive forever more I just want to share an experience with you that happened just last week we we had the ray family with us and they stayed with us on Monday and Tuesday and they was in her home and of course they had places that they stayed at but but they came and and we did we did a few things and and so anyway on on Monday afternoon we were going to have a supper there at brother Andrew's house at in his garage and and uh as we were there and uh we were just talking for a little bit and uh brother Joel was there and and Brother Sam was there brother Tom was there few of the girls Sam's wife wife was there a few of the girls were there and sister Connie was was doing some cooking in the kitchen and she was coming in and out to hear the conversation and you know we had been talking about natural things and carnal things and and after a little while someone asked would you would you share a Supernatural story and so I went in and I picked up the the the little little trinket that you bought me brother Davey and Whitney that you bought me from Disney World and I said well this is just kind of how things work and and I said you can't make yourself have a vision you and God will sometimes put you in a pinch and so I just began the the talking about supernatural things and and I was standing with Isaac and Isaac was in my arms he was a little bitty fell at that time and we were looking out over the water at Epcot Center and as we was looking over the water and seeing the lights and and uh I had a vision that they bought me a Beauty and the Beast uh statue and it had little little sparkles all over it and it was just a beautiful piece and uh I didn't say anything about it and I I noticed when they came from shopping they didn't have any any bags and so they begin to exchange gifts after we got home and I told Connie about what I saw and uh so anyway anyway I I thought you know when that devil starts whispering in your ear I'm telling you this for a reason and he starts whispering in your ear it was just you it was just your thought it was just you know it wasn't really and you know you missed it this time was it a couple months later they came came over to the house and the family was there and uh it was a cardboard box they said Dad we've got this for you and I said well being you've got it for me I I think I need to tell you what's in the box amen now you better be right you better be right or all your family will re lose respect of the vision and what the word is said that's right and so I said uh it's a beauty in the Beast it's a it's a little statue and it's in a blue box he knows what's in the box and that's that's what I heard him say he knows what's in the box and so I opened it up and I and there it was and I opened it and there it was and you know for me it was a pH phenom Al moment so I was sharing that then I was sharing a few other Supernatural things about the Louisiana meeting and and I was sharing some other things that was going on and and the Lord had spoke to me of what to tell the three boys and because 19 of them had came to this meeting you know they had a phenomenal had a phenomenal difficulty of of trying to decide could we all come and then when it all come together it just happened in a couple of days the rooms came open everybody got a ticket on the same plane 19 19 got a ticket on the same plane and they got a one-way trip each way and they flew from Vancouver to Washington DC I didn't even know that was available and so and so they was able to fly here and I was praying in my office and and I said Lord they're not here just for any reason you've got a reason for them to be here and after a little while the Lord dropped something in my heart just something that was Sovereign right in my heart well I knew I just couldn't tell the two boys Joel and Sam I had to have Michael there and so Michael walks into the room he comes into the house and then I knew all the pieces were together you know the script RT said that these signs shall follow them that believe it's not us it's Jesus and so uh after these stories I told them and they was just enjoying that they said they could have listened to it for quite a while and you kind of know what I'm talking about Tom and Melissa you came to my house the other day and bopped in for a few minutes and thought you'd be there and two and a half hours later you finally left and we were just so glad to have you and so when you just heart talking about him he comes by and so and then I just I I I just begin to tell them this is what the Lord told me and when I did it was a pillar of fire dropped right out of that Chandelier and came and just hung right about like that now it wasn't enough just for me to see it but all of a sudden the presence of God just begin to envelope that room and they fell on their knees and wept and cried and screamed to the Lord there was a young lady that was sitting there and I just I just asked her I said have you ever been in anything like this in your life and she said no brother Ron I've never been in anything like this and I told her I said you can be filled with the Holy Ghost right here and in that moment God filled that young girl with the Holy Ghost and it just swept around the room and it just swept around the room you guys remember when we was in Louisiana Adam and his dad and Andrew had drove me to Louisiana and and we was in the cabin i' went to get prayer and and I went to get prayer and you know no lightning or thunder took place but when he dropped in the room brother Adam was filled with the Holy Ghost brother Tim's two grandson Timothy's two boys were filled with the Holy Ghost right there and I came home I hadn't been able to go to work for for months because of the cancer and the chemo when I came home I I haven't missed a day and that's been almost four years ago and isn't God wonderful now I I'm setting myself up just for a little bit because either you believe or you don't believe either you believe or you don't believe many of tourist have went and looked into the Tomb of the Lord Jesus brother Billy Andrews was one that that stands out to me he stood in this pull pit and said that when he went to Jerusalem and and the God took him down to the tomb he said I jumped that rope I went in there and I laid down and the man was screaming you can't be in there you can't be in there he said I want to lay where my Lord laid now these girls had been had been transformed by his presence when we talk about Mary Magdalene she was a woman that was possessed with demons she was a woman that had been transformed by the presence of Jesus Christ in one moment possessed toward not even the community wanted to have nothing to do with her and when Jesus comes into her life she becomes a Lady of Grace and becomes a follower of Jesus Christ with all of the other disciples and the other ladies that were with them but I find it phenomenal of all of the women that were Believers it is instructed for her to be at the tomb that Jesus after he raises he will speak to her first as I was thinking the other day when Jesus Ares he didn't go to a castle he didn't go to the king's Chambers to prove that he was alive he didn't go to the synagogue he went to his seed he went to real Believers that's what we have found today it's not the sizes of some great big church and some great big Cathedral or any government Sinners cuz they don't want him they've taken the Ten Commandments off of the walls they've decided we don't need God anymore but I want you to know tonight he's welcome here now you must remember Jesus he made incredible statements he began to say I and my father are one that's really why he would be crucified when he said I am God are one because listen if he's God then all of those other Pharisees and Sadducees he's not one of them if he's God we've missed the whole picture here he said I have power to lay my life down power to take it up again he said I am the resurrection and the life I and my father are one he cried in John chapter 17 I have finished the work that thou has given me to do he prayed in in the Garden of Gethsemane father if it would be thy will let this cup pass from me now let me just say this to you now if he doesn't go to Calvary and raise again you and I are lost if he doesn't pay the price of redemption you and I are without hope and you say how do you know he lives he lives in us that's enough proof for me brother John chap 20 and verse 11 but Mary stood without the seler Weeping and as she woop wept she stooped down and looked into the Seiler and see two angels in white sitting the one at the head and the other at the feet where the body of Jesus had laay and they said unto her woman why weepest thou and she said unto them because they have taken away my Lord and I know not where they laid him and when she had thus said she turned herself back and saw Jesus standing and knew not that it was Jesus and Jesus saith unto to her woman why weepest thou whom seekest why weepest thou whom seekest thou and she supposing him to be the gardener saith unto him sir if thou hath borne him since hence tell me where that thou Hast laid him and and I will take him away and Jesus saith unto her Mary Hallelujah aren't you thankful when he called your name and she turned herself and sath unto him rabona which is to say master in that moment all of the prophecies everything that he had said now went to another level and she was standing in a very sacred moment raona and Jesus saith unto her touch me not for I am not yet ascended to my father but go to my brethren and say unto them I Ascend unto my father and your father and to my God and your God and Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord that he had spoken these things unto her you ever went to your job and tried to talk about a supernatural service you ever went to a place and tried to tell somebody else about what was a service was like last night it doesn't have the same meaning but when you're there but when you're standing in the presence when it's changing your life and you know that you know that you know that you know that you know that you know he's not a historical God but he's right here in this moment he's in my bedroom he's in my kitchen he's in the pub aside of me he's all over me and I just want more and more of [Applause] him now remember the church leaders had said now he's had some statements that he's made and I just rehearsed them to you destroy this Temple and I'll raise it up in three days they had saw the lame walk the dumb talk the leopards Lazarus RS they had seen him walk on water they had seen him do phenomenal things that they could not explain away they attacked him by the law and they attacked him about a lot of different things but somewhere in the Deep amen they knew there might be something to this so they went to pilate and said now this man has said all of these things he said all these things and and we would like for you to guard the tomb and send guards to the tomb isn't that just like the Devil he's seen things take place in your life and they'll send the Warriors against you just in case it's right oh you might last six months you might last two years but you know you might you know and you begin to work on your mind and battle inside of you but listen when that's ignited inside of your life that se Gene of God there's no going back I don't care what the devil says but there's no going back because that is God living on the inside of you it's no more man trying it's God trying and when you would give up and when you would quit something on the inside of you raises up I can imagine some of these bewildered disciples where do we go The Treasure of the church hung himself Peter's denied the Lord he's denied the Lord he's blasphemed he's cussed like Blasphemous words they hung our leader they beat him until his organs showed through his body they cursed him and they didn't even allow him to hang in decency on the cross they stripped him and gambled for the garments that he wore they put a thorns on his head they even put a plaque over top of him King of the Jews and that was right you're talking about wanting to quit church now there was two boys that decided to take a walk they was going back to their home and as they begin to go back and they're walking and they're discouraged they're tore all to pieces they're headed back to EMAs and I'm sure in their thoughts they didn't know what in the world was going to go on I love the scripture that says and Jesus Drew near yeah you ever had him to draw near and you just know he's in the room you know he's in the room and he drew near they didn't recognize him because the pressures of life in that mortal body he looked well past 50 years old he was strained because he was carrying the sins of the world but now in that new body they couldn't recognize him you may not be able to recognize me and my new body and I may not be able to recognize you in your new body but just say a few words just say a few words Hey Brother Jim how are you doing buddy just say a couple of words now he begins to talk to them and he's asking himh are you discouraged now they're so discouraged they don't recognize his voice think about that you can get into a place to where you're so discouraged when Jesus comes he has to talk to you for a while it's a six-hour walk and he begins to talk to him did did he not do this did he not fulfill the scriptures did he not fulfill this and and it goes through all the scriptures did he fulfill this yes he did did he fulfill this yes he did and he spoke to them about what the prophecy said about him and he was asking them Believers did he fulfill it did Elijah fulfill what he supposed to do in this day and I believe we could say yes he did he did I'm going to take you a step further did the Bride of Jesus Christ just before the Rapture did she fulfill and he begins to talk to them he talks through them he begins to deal with them and you know as he comes to a certain point he's going to go buy their house and the scripture say that they constrained him come here Shannon come here you're going by and you want to make sure that he don't leave so you grab a hold of him oh you grab a hold of you've enjoyed this last six hours but you want him in your home amen now just don't give a little talk grab a hold of him amen and you pull on him God you're welcome in my house I I want you to come in and spend the evening with us amen now he walks into their house and he begins to spend and they're going to break some bread brother vest they're going to break some bread and and jesus takes his position and he tooks it and he put it in in his hands in a certain way and he begins to break the bread and the scripture said their eyes were opened their eyes were opened you know up to that point it's like a cat that can't see and he can't see and he stumbles into things but once your eyes come open once your eyes come open to the word there were scripture there that you tried to understand it you tried to understand it you tried to understand it you read it you read it through denominational filters and you read it through all different kind of filters and you tried to read the Bible and you couldn't make any sense of it but God puts his glasses on you and then the same scripture you couldn't see all of a sudden comes to life and all of a sudden that stranger is the Messiah he's no longer in a tomb he's no longer dead we have experienced the evidence of his resurrection he stood in our home he stood at our table he broke the bread did not our hearts burn within us while he spake to us along on the [Applause] way the scripture in 1 Corinthians chapter 15 says it like this verse one I want to remind you who's writing this Paul if I could give you just a little history for a moment he was Saul he was a denominational believer he was militant brother Doug he was so entrenched he was headed to be a high priest his assignment was to go and put this testimonies listen we finally got Jesus off of the scene but just as soon as we got Jesus off of the scat all these testimonies are starting all they the upper room started and then 3,000 was saved and they're being baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and and all of these people are being healed and all these things the lame man at the gate he's alive we got to put this out and he took papers and he got them arrested and put many to death there was a young man named Steven that was the scripture said was full of the Holy Ghost he was a a late teenager man and he was full of the Holy Ghost and they were going he was going to put him to death and Stephen stood there before that Council and explained the message of the hour it was prophecy it wasn't Moses it wasn't all the other prophets it was prophetic but Jesus Jesus is the Messiah that's him it's fulfilled in Jesus Christ he had a coat on and that coat went into Saul of Tarsus his hands and he stood there and held that coat while Steven was being put to death and Steven said I see Jesus standing I see him standing what a realm being put to death but can look into that Heavenly realm Saul couldn't put it all together but this would never leave him the look on his face would never leave him the countenance him standing in Two Worlds being put to death and seeing God at the same time it would never leave him now it was an event that would be with him Stephen they're they're on the way he's got papers to go arrest more and put more to death and they're on the road and he's got guards with them and all of a sudden this great church leader is struck off of his horse and there was a pillar of fire Hallelujah that stood before him and he could identify this as being God because God met Moses in a pillar of fire he met Ezekiel in a pillar of fire along with other prophets in a pillar of fire now it's his turn now it's his turn to meet him in a Pillar of Fire and out of that Pillar of Fire God begins to speak to him and begins to tell him I am Jesus none of the other guards saw it none of the other people saw it it was to him now I'm coming to you you're in a service and God deals with you and changes your life in a moment and you walk out and say that's the greatest service I've ever been in my life none of the other people felt what you felt you went home and told your family none of them felt what they felt you go to your job and none of them felt what you felt but you [Applause] know did I did I ring that for you did I get that for you word is sent to to one of the Disciples of the Lord and he begins to actually argue with God God this man has done much trouble to the church this man has put many to death and now you're asking me to go expound the word to him because people know your history they can't believe your touch people want to identify you as what you was with all your scars and all your sins and all your friendships and all the old relationships and want to keep putting that back on you but you're not that man no [Applause] more come on Church it looks like the same house it sounds like the same house but there's a new king living on the inside of your heart and you're under the influence of that new king you might have one day been under the influence of Jack Daniels or or or Miller lot but you're not under that influence no more you're under the influence of the mighty angel that is inside of your life God's not coming back to Rapture buildings he's coming to Rapture living [Applause] Epistles behold I show you a mystery now watch who's writing this we shall not sleep but we shall be changed brother Ron I don't believe in the Supernatural read the scripture I don't believe all in those emotions read the scripture brother Ron I don't like how y'all shout well you know let me just talk to you a little bit can

coming church now he don't mind you coming to church but he don't want you get in the flesh and all of a sudden you start Clapping Your Hands a little bit and all of a sudden you start dancing a little bit and all of a sudden you feel that presence all over you Hallelujah that's just a warm up now now I'm getting to where I want to go well is it scriptural brother Ron okay when Jesus raised the evidence of the resurrection amen now he goes into paradise and there was Abraham and Sarah and and and David and Jeremiah and all the prophets and all the Believers and they look at the door and the one they've been waiting on for now thousands of years is standing there that's him that was with me under the oak tree that's him that changed my body back to being younger men that's him that was a whe within the middle of the wheel that's him that was in the pillar of fire that's him he's come to set us free he's the one we've been looking for Hallelujah can you just imagine with me a moment when he opens the gates and said come with me come with me I was dead but I'm alive I got the keys I got the keys death don't hold you no longer woo woo you talk about noise when they come up out of that room when they come out of that room oh what a day that it was I'm not done but you're welcome to be seated some things are too strong for even for this body help me now let me just lay it like this you know there's a lot of people can say things but then to prove it so a lot of things can say people can say things just to work people up but then to let God prove it that it was right Stephen she's coming it's going to be okay it didn't look like it at the moment but who's got your arm Whitney she's going to talk it's going to be all right and I've had her for the last two or three days and let me tell you she's talked to me she's talked to me in bed she's sung to me she's Jibber jabbered I believe she's going to outt talk you I never thought that would ever become possible ever again but right there she sits once she couldn't talk now she talks brother vest your boys are are with us and one of them's with us we grew up in church and just raise your hand there so everybody will know you we grew up in church and at one time we went to church CU you had the same py that I did and you go to church it don't mean a whole lot you know it's stories stories of of Jesus stories of brother brandom and stories of other believers in the church but one day cuz I see your atmosphere setting even right there one day one day what he was saying and what he experienced you experienced and all the story stor that he had told you about you before they meant a lot to you but now you're telling him stories Hallelujah a that the truth you're telling him stories so this is not a historical God it's a very much a living God so now you can relate you can relate to somebody standing into a prayer line and the prophet would say now this is your condition and he would say I I see two doctors standing over top of you one's a a tall skinny man and the other's a short and he called it short fat man I don't know what he would call me but and he had dark Rim glasses on and he said I see you're laying on a on a hospital in an operation and they're holding your organ in their hands now listen that woman hadn't seen that now you say well that's just a m rear no no no no you you don't have the point if you've had an operation sister Pat they're going to tell you they're going to tell you now count to 10 or uh just say say a word or or think about some nice things and and they're going to talk to you and all of a sudden you're gone and you have no conscience or no memory I I went into a room one time and I just I just kind of kind of make this I want to make this real and they were getting ready to do brain surgery on me and so they put a metal harness on my head that's a stainless steel metal harness and they put it around your head and it and it's got two bars that come down here and two bars that come down there and what that is to hold your head so steady that it won't move when they go in there to do do their work and so they they tell me said now we're going to assign someone to talk to you and catch your attention and we're going to put you to sleep just like that and in about 10 minutes we're going to wake you up and you're going to think it's not even over with well there was a woman that was standing there she's assigned to take care talk to me and she said uh where are you from I said well I I live in Gros but but I grew up in Pilot and Pilot's just a little bitt BB that's where I grew up at on farm and I said used to do farm work around there she said I grew up in czeck which is literally just right up the road and I mean it's just I don't even know how to say it it's like Grotto and what's right next to Grotto we's cave like Grotto and we's cave but pilot is way smaller than Grotto and where's cave is or chck is well it's not even on the map and I begin to talk to her and she says now Ron what we're going to do is I'm going to I'm going to go right in the middle of a sentence and you're going to go to sleep and when you wake up I'm going to finish the sentence there's about about 30 people in the room and I just went to sleep and then when I woke up I had this thing on my head now you see I'd had a brain surgery 10 days before that and my skull was weak because of the 10 days before that and my my skull was because they were putting these heavy screws there were screws about that big and they were put them into my skull and and I was in excruciating pain in excruciating pain you see I was there how many of you just just felt that no you experienced by emotion but you see I was there and they took me in and they gave me four different pain medicines to get me to relax enough that they could put me in the tube and they did that and three minutes in the tube I went to sleep [Music] Hallelujah I went to sleep and I woke up Up 3 minutes before that 4-Hour operation was over with Hallelujah on the way being pushed down I'll just drop this here being pushed down there was an elderly man that was pushing me down to the surgery from the harness being put on my head to where the operation was going to happen and I prayed a prayer because we believe in breaking chains we believe in Breaking Chains and I pray a prayer not quietly but I pray to prayer father in the name of Jesus Christ if I have to face melanoma that's went into my brain and into my lungs and now in my second surgery Lord I want to be the one that breaks the chains that my boys and my grandchildren and my great-grandchildren when they come along they won't have to face this let me be the chain breaker when I got to the room I continued praying when I got to the room the man he said I have done this for 30 years I have never heard a sweeter prayer than what you just prayed so I know something about operations you're an operation he's a tent tall Slender Man the other man is a is a short fat man he's got dark glasses and he's holding your organ in his hands and he said this is what's going on she don't know nothing about what happened she don't know nothing about that taking place but it wasn't brother brandham it was God now listen if he just tells her that he tells her her name he tells her where she's from he tells her all all about herself just to let her know it was more than a man that was on her case aren't you glad when God takes your case aren't you glad when God takes your case when it seems hopeless he takes your case and now once he takes your case there's going to be [Applause] results sure he was was blind but now he sees sure he was lame but now he walks sure they were worst Sinners that you could ever meet but now they're are cream of the crop pillars in a church I'm talking about you now you once had cancer you know what I'm talking about you're fighting for your life chemo is no fun I know what we're talking about you know the dark hours but isn't it good when Jesus comes by life's worth living for that woman stands in the line and she goes away healed never to be the same ever again I'm not talking about one case I'm talking about tens of thousands of cases we've been we've listened to these tapes for Years brother Randy he come toward the end of service he said you know I'm waiting on something I'm waiting on him to come and then when he come that was especially before 63 then be when he comes I take every spirit in this building under my control prayer line called boom boom boom bo boom boom boom it's one thing if that just is an event but people laid down their crutches people could see there's a lady that was in Florida with us and she came and sat at her table and she sat down she sat across from brother Tim and myself and she said brother Tim I was in the prayer line and she said I was four years old I believe I'm telling this for a real reason I was four years old and they call me an insane little girl that that I would never be able to speak and I would never be able to read I would never be able to function ain't that right Connie she was about sister nany's age about her build and she was sitting there her Daddy had been healed of a back condition now she's standing in the line and brother brandham just took her and pulled her up to his coat I love this he just took her and pulled her up to his coat and he prayed a real simple prayer and he said go and be well young lady here she is almost 90 had been a preacher's wife had been a bookkeeper had had phenomenal jobs through her life in a moment in a moment she went from being literally to where her brain didn't work Hallelujah to where she become a brilliant child it means something if it's you yeah it means something if you're it's you now I want to tell you about your future Miracle is is that okay is that okay I want I want to tell you about a future Miracle you see the other day we went to Brother Bill's bedside and brother Bill was getting ready to leave it was birth pains that was happening and he was getting ready to go home now you saywell brother Ron that's not a miracle oh yes it is it's a phenomenal Miracle to leave a house that is a pest house to where that there's no end if there's not death and and listen we have the keys of death Hell In The Grave so death for a Believer is not an enemy it's only the taxi cab for him and guys like brother Wayne and brother Bill and brother Leo and pillars of this church I could go on and on but listen listen Sister Sarah all of those Believers and they and they go from this Dimension to another dimension what a miracle what a miracle that it is not to have to lay and suffer but to step from this Dimension to another dimension into a well body and to Fellowship in that realm here we are sitting here this morning and we're listening to the word now I hope I can do this right it's kind of like sitting with Jesus and I'm not comparing myself with Jesus but it's kind of like sitting with Jesus and talking to them about Resurrection morning telling them about things that are going to go on and you're sitting and you're listening to him well it's well brother Josh it's a good sermon but you're not stepping into it as a matter of fact some things we just don't catch until we're there in the moment and he assigns Mary to come to the Grave he didn't assign pilot or Kings or high priest Mary a woman that had had had a horrendous past a woman that a lot of people were still saying a lot of things about I'd like for you to come and and and anoint the body because he needs somebody to witness he needs somebody to be the witness that can say I was there I was there I saw the Angels no you didn't I saw the Angels was it a myth I saw the angels I sat in Full Gospel Lighthouse and I heard brother Ron and brother Andrew and all the other preachers brother Tom and brother Michael preach I heard all these preachers preach and brother Homer preach all those years but between the sermon and the event that's where the devil likes to get in now how many of you would say this been through troubles from Sunday night to Saturday evening and the devil will bring up all kind of drama in your life he'll bring all kind of drama in your life and he will try to get you to throw a stone at this one and thrown at this one and why don't he get you to throw a stone out there those people let me just drop a couple things here there's a sign in LNS Diner it's a little bitty Diner it's a place where brother brandom actually ate and it's a sign said that people that talk about people are ignorant what you saying that for listen don't talk about your brother and sister don't talk about him don't talk about him if they're doing wrong just pray for them we all on the same Journey we need help we need help here and Satan will bring up all kind of drama in your life this and that this that we a team here we a team here I I'll just share this with you I've got a table at home that sets 18 people that means that we got four more coming along some point in time no me and you ain't going to do that sister Connie but I made up in my mind when my children were really little no drama say it with me no drama no drama no drama and if you can get drama out of your life are you with me now if you can get the drama out of your life somebody ought to help me preach right here if you can get the drama out of your life cuz gossip will eat the Christ right out of you Satan will drop thoughts in your mind that you really don't need to think about one another but if you can get love over top of every situation in your life and realize we're a team here well brother Ron I I just don't have nothing to talk about if I'm not talking about people talk about this right here I could sing but I better not talk about me me oh my so somewhere between sermons all these great preachers and the event the devil's going to work on you I'm preaching to you whether you know it or not I'm trying to help you whether you know it or not but on that morning on that morning you may have served the Lord 50 years on that morning prophecy and time intercepts and the evidence of the Resurrection begin to take C hold of your body there was moments that God proved himself to you by healing you of sugar diabetes healing you of cancer healing you of different things in your life and making a way where there seemed to be no way paying bills that you couldn't dare pay and you proved him to be a real God to you but on that morning I lost my track but I'm going to go back and do it again yeah First Corinthians 15 and 51 sorry to have held you so long behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall be changed I want you to know I believe it in a moment in the twinkl of an ey at the last trumpet for the trumpet shall sound and the dead in Christ shall be raised Incorruptible and let me just add that to you it's going to be undisputable and we shall be changed for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this Mortal must put on immortality so when the corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this Mortal shall have put on put on immortality then shall be brought to pass a saying that is written death read the lesser of this with me death is swallowed up in Victory oh death where is thy sting oh grave where is thy Victory The Sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ read this next verse therefore my beloved Brethren be a steadfast unmovable always a abounding in the work of the Lord for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord Give the Lord a great big hand right there brother Ron I don't believe it hang around brother Ron do you believe that Mary Magdalene saw him absolutely 100% I do just as much as I know that Thomas put his hand in his sight listen I I preached this about a year to you let me just rehearse it for you one more time what an incredible event that took place he said Mary don't touch me I haven't ascended to my father yet listen time doesn't matter too much to God and in just a few few hours he's gone and then he comes back to be with Copus on the road to aess and breaks bread with them and then he comes to the disciples that are all weary and all nervous and all tore up because he wants them to have the evidence of the Resurrection Thomas was doubting and he said notice he couldn't be touched then but now he can Thomas don't you put your hand in my side yeah it's where the sword went in Titus put your hand up put in there that's what Thomas did he put his hand in in his side and Jesus sat down you know what he did he had honeycomb Hallelujah and he had fish and they ate you talking about having time at church and then Jesus disappeared I've always wondered what happened to the fish in the honeycomb some of you get it today some of you get it tomorrow but in the moment in the twinkle of an eye you and I are going to to be together for eternity quicker than

do so while we're here waiting on those events is to destroy the works of the devil so let me let me just coin a friend phrase for you you go ahead and point to your neighbor you are Satan's worst
