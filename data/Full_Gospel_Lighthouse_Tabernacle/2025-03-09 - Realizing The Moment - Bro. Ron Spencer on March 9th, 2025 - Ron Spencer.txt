God's one to place the heart [Music] there and he can anoint doctors not only can he anoint doctors I'm praying that God dispatches an angel to stand in the room [Music] father father in the name of Jesus Christ that's a name that is above every name a power that's above every Power a principalities that's above every principality now father you commissioned us as men to lay hands on the sick and they shall recover now we realize hundreds of years ago they couldn't not even thought about this type of surgery and we would go to pre mature Graves but because you ignited the minds of man and allowed man to discover how to help us in our Humanity [Music] Tuesday as he goes to open heart surgery I pray with that when they wake up Tuesday morning I pray they wake up with a fresh anointing Lord his brother Bill goes to surgery I pray that father he feels an assurance and a confidence and may somehow may you feel the angel the Lord in the room even before doctors begin to work father doctors can do what they do but you're the Healer I pray in the name of Jesus Christ may you watch over this surgery and may you help him today in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen I love you I

help in the time of need amen amen looking forward to having and brother Tom and brother Michael with us next week and and brother Tom's been a special friend for a long time and uh we met in the Murphy's Boro meetings my mother and father would share their anniversary every year to go hear brother bcll preach and they would go there and brother Tom has been son-in-law to brother bcll and and uh and we we met and uh we've been buddies a long time and and uh we have a lot of likenesses and uh he's almost like a physical brother to me and so you know when I went that year and the Lord had laid on my heart that God was going to call brother Michael to preach brother Michael was very satisfied working in the office and and uh he never thought he would ever preach the gospel and uh in the prayer line I dealt with brother Michael and he screamed no no no and the next day he he wanted to have some time with me and and he told me he said brother Ron I want to talk to you out of that and I said well I'm not the one that talked you into it and I said God God has called you to preach the gospel and uh I don't know if you've you hear him during the the year and watching but he's a phenomenal speaker and I'm looking forward to having them with us and uh so don't just let this time just pass you by enjoy it while your here's here and so we're looking forward to having them and and uh kind of become an annual event and so and so we'll have them as long as they will let let us have them and so we'll do that last night I got a special thing in the offering plate and it was a check sister Wanda kind of takes care of Zoe during the service and she was writing out her check for tithes and so Zoe wrote out hers [Music] [Applause] and for all of us that know the miracle of Zoe they told us that she would never go to school come on and that it would she would be in her 20s before she would talk but I can tell you what she can climb up on my lap and get anything that she wants and so amen yesterday she climbed up on my lap and Isaac climbed up on my lap and and they decided they wanted a lasso rope Papa we want a lasso we want to be Cowboys and what happened brother

enjoyed last night amen hallelujah I just enjoyed last night Andrew just relaxed and preached last night and so we I so enjoyed it I I sat there and I I just I just marveled at what God has done in his life and and so we're just we're just so thankful for what he's done amen amen now this this sermon comes from a special meeting that I had this week and it was about it was about 4 o'clock in the morning when he came and uh so this this sermon came I had something else on my heart but this came this this week and and I I just thought I wish Connie could wake up and be in this presence but I didn't want I didn't want to break anything as what was going on so so we I'll just share a few things with you and I would like to speak to you on realizing the moment yes Lord realizing the moment Psalms chapter 118 and verse 23 this is the Lord's doing it is marvelous in our eyes this is the day which the Lord hath made we will rejoice and be glad in it in 1 Corinthians chapter 15 and verse 51 behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall be changed in a moment and in the twinkle of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised Incorruptible and we shall be changed I love this verse for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this Mortal must put on immortality amen God bless you may the Lord bless the reading of his word this morning I think every one of us have a Divine appointment with the Lord amen and you just know there are certain times maybe one or a couple of times in your life that you just know that you know that you know this is a very special place to be at am brother Alden I didn't ask you permission but I want to I want to use a statement that you've told me many times brother alden's been around me quite a bit and and we enjoy some time together and we've enjoyed some time away and vacations together we've enjoyed work together we've enjoyed hunting together and he said I just want to be around you just in case something Supernatural happens Lord this week I was I was I was just going through some YouTube and I was looking for sermons that that we all enjoy and and this week maybe it's been there for a long time but I caught some some moments of brother branham's some home videos of of brother brandham and maybe you can find him they're easy toine but anyway there was a five minute clip there was a I think 11 minute clip that was there and then there was some more clips and and I watched it and itel I just felt led to watch it over and over and over again I don't know how many times I watched it but sister Connie went on to bed and I was just watching that over and over and over again and and so I as I was watching it I I kind of begin to question myself why am I watching this over and over and over again and then the Lord dealt with me amen and I begin to think about the people that was in the movie that was there that was with brother brandom and his little slender tie and and you know it he was had his cowboy hat at times and and he was just enjoying maybe the wedding for for for his family and uh and I I was just watching it and then it just came to me these people don't realize what is really going on they don't realize the presence that they're really in am the moment that they're there and I begin to think about it and this led me on the on the morning at 4:00 I begin to go in my mind and the spirit of the Lord begin to deal with me of of St John chapter 4 when Jesus would go to the well and he would go by the way of sikar he would go there and and you would think you would think for just a little while in Samar ARA why would you go to Samaria a lot of very difficult people there people that really don't believe will not believe anything and the disciples will even kind of Wonder within theirself and Jesus sends them away and it would send them away to go buy vils of meat or or or whatever for the food and he'll send them away because they won't understand and he will go and set on a well and he would sit here for quite a while and finally there would come a woman in the evening time or the heat of the day and she would come and he would begin to have a conversation with her and he would say I I'd like a drink and she'd begin to rebuff him for a little bit then she would tell him of her religious nature and she would begin to tell him you're a prophet or these kinds of things and begin to re buff him and but he knew who she was but she didn't know who he was now here's uh something that I want to get to you this morning just for a quick second Jesus never told any of those priests who he was he never told any of the rulers of the city who he was but he would talk to predestinated seed that was caught in a very immoral situation one to which Satan had tried to destroy her and tried to put a lot of sin on her life to which that you would think that she's disqualified from ever sitting in church but God looked past all of the wickedness he looked past all of her flesh and all of her excuses and saw a predestinated seed that was inside of there and he would begin to speak to her how important was this meeting that's what I want to ask how important was this meeting listen when Jesus finishes with her and begins to talk about her her five husbands I thought the program chosen did an incredible job of catching that I I thought they did an incredible job of catching that and then she would realize the moment that's him he would tell her that he was the Messiah but in a moment in a very sacred moment she realized who he was and in that moment listen everything in her life was changed now I I want you to understand the prophet of this day would stand before Untold amount of congregations not just Jeffersonville but he would stand around the world and it would go back and capture this story yes because knowing that the Messiah has come in this day for the Bride of Jesus Christ and he was going to use more than the prophet's body or his voice but he was going to stand in those audiences from small audiences to literally tens of thousands of audience and display that Messiah gift again and he was going to be standing before audiences that would have different backgrounds Hindu he was going to stand before people that had all kinds of false gods even Methodist and Baptist and Full Gospel people that would come to those audiences and they would sit there let me just say this to you but a handful and I want you to catch this a handful caught what was going on in the service many of us have had this experience sitting in a service maybe unsaved having a friend that set him beside of you in the same condition and while you're sitting in the service something all of a sudden grabbed you and you went that's God that's real that's what I've been looking for all my life that's what I've been looking for and your friend go I didn't get anything their life what they walked out their life just went on was just stayed the same but you because of that predestinated seed was sitting in the moment you had lived your life for maybe a couple of decades or maybe 40 50 years but all of a sudden you had a Divine appointment thank you Lord are you with me I'm going to tell you just a couple of stories brother Jonah 's father his his father had had there was a war in Germany we all know about that but he saw a girl on the other side of the street and he he saw her just saw her and he said that's the kind of girl that I want to have as a wife years literally years later I think somewhere around 10 years later he's in Canada and he's looking across the street and he sees that same girl take the chances of that and some way or another I don't want to go into the story but he wanted to meet her and he wanted to have some time with her and she said well come to my house for Bible study he didn't know anything about Bible and so she would read to him the Bible cuz he had never read it and she would read to him about prophets and she would read to me about Moses and Noah and and all the prophets of the Old Testament so she invites him to a meeting where William brandham is going to be the speaker and he goes to the meeting he invites a friend he invites a friend to be with him in the meeting and so he goes to the meeting listen and he goes to the meeting and he sits there and he said here's brother brandham one time once it's all he ever heard him one time and he tells his friend that man is a prophet he spends the rest of his life as a gives his heart to God spends the rest of his life as a preacher of the message of the hour he didn't miss his moment he didn't miss his moment that Divine appointment hit his life and his family is Believers and they have a church in Colona I believe it is but he caught the moment another Minister tells that they were in brother bram's meeting said they were sitting there and brother brandom is praying for a man that had a brain tumor and is's praying for the man and said every person here bow your head and here sets a young man that's going to be a preacher in the message and he's got a friend just brought him and brother Brandon prays for that man that has a brain tumor go your way and be well goes off of the side so later after there they leave the meeting he said when they prayed for that man with the brain tumor he said did you bow your head he said no I didn't bow my head I didn't think nothing of this business now listen I want you to think about the important part here six months later his friend dies of a brain tumor on how important was that was that service how important was that irreverence are you with me we've had a lot of people here listen this this Hillside wouldn't hold the people that have sit in our services and for many they just didn't get anything or they just walked away but something held you something held you many of you got families and and they just you know they didn't they don't see anything important about what's here but something held you something grabbed a hold of your life and it wasn't you it was God are you with me now you know a lot of people say they know him but they don't know him there's a lot of people sit in church and they know about him but they don't know him are you with me I want you to understand there's a major difference there's a phenomenal difference about knowing him and really knowing him amen are you with me now to know him in one one way is good but to really know him I watch people that get a Justified state of their being and they'll begin to walk in a Justified state but after a little bit you can tell that they're just in a Justified State and they really know need a a deeper walk listen I think that is one of the things that we must get don't stall right amen keep going keep asking for more of God go to the depths of God I want all that he has for us when I was thinking on these things I I have I Haven even shared this with brother Timothy but I was I was I I saw a vision a brother Timothy sitting in a in a room and somebody was there and and they were sitting there and they were just talking and they were supposed to be a believer and they were just talking and and brother Timothy's got a certain way about him and he's just the most he can relax you and and uh I just love him amen and after a little while he just said you're a Believer but there's something really missing in your life you need more of the Lord Jesus I'm afraid that's too much the case in too many people are you with me I'm not here to throw a rock at you listen if you need more of him there's more of him to be had and I'd say every one of us here want more of the Lord Jesus all of us that should be our desire this morning I need more of [Applause] him after the death bual and resurrection of the Lord the disciples were no doubt disillusioned amen The Treasure of the church has committed suicide the leader has been hung on a tree and they've made all a manner of fun of him and not only have they made all manner of fun of them they beat him and he allowed himself to be beat like no other human being and they put thorn on his head Thorns to which causes Strokes over and over again and these people that did it was mocking and making all kind of fun and he allowed it to happen and then towards the end when there was still life still life living inside of him he turned to a a Thief one's making fun and the other one is is rebuking the other thief and he says remember me remember me you're talking about a Divine moment he had never been in church he had never heard this man preach he had never saw the blind sea he had never seen the lame walk but there was something about his presence listen he realized I'm worthy to be on this cross I'm worthy to die like this remember me when you come into your kingdom and Jesus says this day amen folks let me just say this to you what words to say this day this day you'll be with me in Paradise this day listen it doesn't matter what this clock says it doesn't matter what this clock says this thief in moments in moments steps into eternal life the disciples see all of this and then they watch him forgive those forgive those who are crucifying spitting on him forgive those listen that's not in humanity to do Humanity holds grudges amen Humanity holds very difficult things but our King of Kings our Lord Our cancering reme Redeemer come on forgive those amen cuz he's looking past them looking at you it's more than a song when I was on the cross when he was on the cross I was on his mind now the disciples are perplexed listen cuz a lot of times in this life you know brother Bram talks about you know as a builder the wall can go straight and all of a sudden it takes a corner there's a lot of people can go straight but all of a sudden God just changes the agenda and there's a lot of people that'll walk along with you as long as it's straight but when you turn a corner amen when you turn a corner all of a sudden they'll keep going straight you know sometimes we think well you know but they're my friends in the scriptures they walked away too so people are going to walk away from us if you look back at the decades that we've been here and the decades that we walk with God there's a lot of people that set beside of us that just only holds you to tell you of the eternal life hope am I Landing this okay Andrew am I Landing this now I want to say this there's sometimes that there is an ultimate important thing to be at the right place at at the right time amen can I say can I say that right it's very important to be at the right place at the right time yeah brother Ron I've got a thousand other things to do I understand I understand but Jesus told them to go to the upper room and there was 500 no doubt plus 500 people there brother Doug this has one of been one of the greatest mysteries of my mind what would be more important you look looking at the resurrected Lord you've watched him you've watched him hang on the tree you have heard you've heard about the women going to the tomb you've heard about them going to put spices on his body and the tomb is empty you've heard about him showing up with Peter and the other disciples and Thomas doubting and he allowed Thomas to put his hand in his side so it settles the question now Jesus is giving his final sermon on on Earth in that body come now let me to say this to you let me let me go here cuz I don't think I've landed this if an angel come here a physical Angel standing six foot tall dark complected come here come here listen let me let me land this yeah how many people went to Brother branham's meeting how many people went to Brother branham's meeting and saw this and saw this you know rub their eyes they saw the angel in the room listen we've got testimonies I sat with a man as a preacher and he said I saw the angel and he said we knew brother brandom is the preacher with the angel and we I don't know how many people we've got here but the angel comes and he's standing be beside brother Ron or standing beside of brother Andrew and he's standing there and God allows you to have a glimpse into another realm and there he stands thank listen brother brandom gave us a very physical description of what the angel look like dark complexed about hair down to his shoulder about six foot tall we're not making an illusion listen he walked with the angel and we see that here on a service and you get the glimpse of seeing the angels of the Lord you get that moment yes Lord and you get to look into that realm now you can hold on that for 10 years 20 years and it would be a special time but let me just say greater than that is the ministers that stand behind the pull pit that take thus sayith the Lord sir and it deals with your heart and all of a sudden God begins to speak to you and you have a Divine appointment with God in that service amen did I did I land that and then people sit beside him and go I didn't get nothing out of that Serv service you know that preacher went an hour and five minutes listen folks time don't mean nothing when we're dealing with God I only have limited energy now and so I try to make sure that with whatever time that I have that I land it and that you get it listen I'm being very honest with you I don't know how many services I've got left to preach so I want to make sure but let me just say this you you may be on a quicker clock than I am no man's promise tomorrow so never walk into a service and go well that's just another service it may be your [Applause] last 500 is there and 380 people let's just let's just bring it to this place how many thousand have walked away I'm not talking about a handful how many thousand have set in these this building and now have something different to do and now I have something different to do listen when I was dealing with my brother your father to come to the Lord and He Stood Beside of me on a walkway and he was a professional going into professional bowling and he was carrying whatever kind of H whatever kind of average that he was carrying listen he could have been a a great bowler he could have had phenomenal success Be A Millionaire today and I stood there on that walk way that was I was as tall as he was and I was standing there I said tell me what excuse on tell me what excuse is more important than serving God tell me anything is more important than serving God maybe even you you are sitting here this morning God's caused me to come down this line well I don't know what's so important here I'll tell you what's important here eternal [Applause] life I need a scripture you gain the whole world you gain the whole world and lose your soul what have you gained what profits you we got a president in one of his houses would make all of us satisfied one and he's got phenomenal amount of houses huge monstrous houses but that didn't satisfy come on Amen something's driving him I don't know what it is but I want you to know I wouldn't trade what I got for one amen for one of his houses sure he's going to fulfill the scripture somewhere and brother brandom's message somewhere he's going to fulfill it are you with me are you with me two disciples are finding themselves walking away amen listen they're not where they need to be they're on the road to a mess they're discouraged and a stranger catches up with them and he walks with them and he begin to ask them why are you so discouraged have you not heard and they begin to disc describe the story of Jesus and to describe the crucifixion they're going home where should they have been they should have been with the other disciples they should have been at the tomb brother B said they should have been at the tomb all of those disciples should have been at the tomb but remember when Jesus is here he told those girls to come come to his tomb to anoint his body knowing he was going to be gone I could shout a while right here I could shout a little while right here well brother Ron but does God foresee things well he went to a house that the girl was dad knowing he's going to have dinner with her he went to a tomb that he had walked away from for days knowing this afternoon I'm going to have dinner with Lazarus listen John chapter 12 I'm going to have dinner with Lazarus but the Christ Christian people miss the point they come on to kill Lazarus how many people fight the message they missed the point brother Ron what's been your question to them all through the years why are you there amen come on why are you where you are questioning the message that's right why are you there tell me what's more important than this message I hope I hope I'm M so he begins to join himself to these guys now he's going to walk six hours with those those disciples and here's my point they're not even going to realize who's walking with them did you just catch that last statement there's a lot of times he's walking with you and you don't even realize he's been walking with me for five years he been walking with me for five years I would hate to think that I've had to face cancer by myself this listen folks this is not a common coal are you with me listen they can take they can take the x-rays and the MRIs and the cancers there they can take it of my lungs and the Cancer's there the chemo is not driving it away they're even talking about moving me to a different kind of chemo I'll tell you I don't have I don't I'm not don't having confidence I love my doctors and I appreciate the message but who's walking with me is the most important thing for all those on the internet and those here that's been going through some real trials I want you to understand you may not be able to see him or feel him but he's with [Applause] you now brother brandom makes a statement in modern events made clear by Pro prophecy and brother brandom said would you like to hear what he told them you know sometimes they were just sitting in the service and didn't realize they were in Two realms amen what do you mean well brother brand says in a couple places he talks about the garden and when Adam and Eve was driven from the garden and one night he's preaching about how that they drove out of the garden and then just a couple of services later he said the other night I watched them walk out of the garden so here is here listen RCA is not the first video and brother brand you okay you okay and brother brandham is with them on the road he's watching them on the road to Emmas I'm just going to just go out on a limb here and he said they were briefed on all the late happenings of the crucifixion and the story of the grave and the tomb and the women had seen him and another one that had seen him and so forth they briefed him on that and and they he goes right on with the word and and he quotes himself through the word and he says now look in Zachariah and he must have quoted Zechariah 11 and 12 for he was sold with 30 pieces of silver was not the Messiah supposed to be sold for 30 pieces of silver in Psalms 41 and verse 9 listen brother brandham said he quoted the word about himself and in Psalms 41-9 he was betrayed by his friends in Zechariah 13 and verse 7 forsaken by his disciples in Psalms 35 And1 Accused by false Witnesses I could go on and on but he spent six hours taking the scriptures and talking about that he fulfilled these scriptures I mean was here when brother bcll told the story about sitting in the car and remember what they were talking about does this ministry fulfill [Music] Elijah and he said about the time that they said those things the angel came into the car listen I've heard him tell it so many multiple times and the angel came into the car and he said it pressed my face against the window took my breath and I looked toward brother Bram out of the corner of my eye and said he was Ash and white and his beard was sticking straight out said that angel was setting forward looking back in the car what was the conversation they were having does this ministry fulfill I was on a boat with brother bisco and I said I've heard you tell it one time that there was another boy in the car right and I've never heard you tell it but one time and you just just bumped it and said there was another boy in the car and he said brother Ron he didn't see it how far is the distance between the back seat and the front seat an angel's in the car brother brandom's countenance has changed brother bisc is pressed against the window and listen not only did they see an angel but only moments later Amen brother brother brandom is telling brother bis whenever he comes something good always happens and they've killed a monster animal and it drops in a perfect place right I wonder sometimes how many people sitting in the same PWS come on Church come on Church how many people let me go further how many people will sit in these same seat and miss the resurrection and miss a body change listen let's pinch our conscience brother R said get desperate before God I'm not here to play a game with you I'm not here to pre preach another pretty sermon brother Brandon would tell the people don't miss it amen how important is the service ask brother Doug ask brother duck what if he'd have been home mowing the grass on is church really important ask him ask him that's David that's David didn't want to be here but look at him his life's totally changed than you Lord few years ago he would have told you I'll never be in church but ask him today One Moment One Moment somebody told me the other day Jimmy brother Jimmy you look good in that suit too somebody told me the other day he said that ain't the same Jimmy that's just not the same Jimmy you're right I'm not the same Ron I pray that you're not the same person that's a that's a what's one of the greatest compliments that we can get brother Jimmy we're not the same person these these guys walk six hours I'm not going to be much longer because I'm getting weak walk six hours with Jesus and they come to a spot to where their home was and Jesus made as though he was going to go on and they constrained him come in come in they constrained him to come by he knew we was going to their house anyway but he was waiting on their response he was waiting on their response God's waiting on our response [Applause] it's more than just walking in and sitting down in a Pew I never want this church to be just another intellectual dead church I want this church to be a house of prayer and a house of worship and a place where we con strain him where we wash his feet where we worship Him and he comes in and he comes in and and the bread comes to the table now it was a custom that the head of the house broke the bread the father breaks the bread can you imagine that moment that Jesus Walks steps across and he takes the bread and he begins to break it now brother brandham said he did it like he had did it before but not only did he do it like he did before but he took his place as the head and brother Brandon preaches he preaches multiple sermons and he said and then their eyes were opened and then their eyes were open notice the scripture as it comes down it said did not our hearts burn with within us as he spake to us along the way but they missed it for six hours and in a moment oh God help us in a moment when he breaks the bread Glory the story was never the same from that point on what an intellectual sermon after 6 hours but in a moment with a Divine appointment they realize that's him that's him I said in a service I was a young convert a young convert I'm going to be who's 22 here 22 23 somewhere in that range Anna you're wearing it well and we go to a place and my dad says I want you to hear a preacher preach his name's Ed bisco I want you to hear a preacher preach and he said you heard him in 1978 but I want you to hear him again so we drive about four hours on Sunday morning and we walk into this nice church and sister Connie was a kid and she walks into the and they go the young people go to Sunday school and they all of a sudden Connie's gone to Sunday school you know I Connie's gone they put my mom and dad in a different spot and I'm setting about where you are brother Bisal comes out and steps up on the stage and I'm sitting there there's a lot of things in my mind I've been a convert two months two months and I'm sitting there and in my carnal flesh I'm I'm aggravated cuz they took my wife to Sunday school and I'm sitting there my father and mother they've took them to a different place of the building and they put me here and and I begin to think in my mind what I'm preaching to you right now God has orchestrated this whole day and God has put me on the second row and upfront close to where I can get what the preacher is preaching I'm telling you from my heart and a youngl looking Ed bu bisco steps out on the stage and he's just bouncing you know I'm expecting an older preacher kind of slow in he speaking I'm expecting an older man to preach and he begins to preach there's probably 400 people in the building and it is as though he's preaching to me amen I relayed this to him several times and you know what his statement was to him to me it was a Divine appointment for you brother Ron and he preached on the seals the breach between the church ages and the seals and it was preaching in a church that was missing the message but I didn't hallu I don't care how many hundred is said in the meeting don't miss I told you that story for a real reason said don't miss my brother Ron if I was in brother branham's meeting and he was telling the woman at the well now I'm finished he was telling the woman at the well musicians can come he's telling the woman at the well and all of a sudden he begins to call your name Chris Morris you're from Harrisonburg Virginia now you know that but now you are realizing God knows that you've never seen that man before in your life and he tells you about 14 different things about yourself that he knows exactly about you and he tells your zip code and he tells you your address and he tells you about your children and your wife brother Ron but you're just making that up listen we had brother Tom Brady here how many remember brother Tom Brady and brother Tom Brady told it over and over again his mind has slipped now he can never do that again but he stood here in this pull pit and he told us about what is the attraction on the mountain and his wife has written him a letter and it's about her feet he hadn't told that to nobody and he's sitting there and brother Brown calls him out Mr Brady from me listen if brother Brandon misses one time you wouldn't believe it listen this was more than a gift listen don't discredit it's just a gift this was God to this generation and if the world misses it so what we didn't miss it and this is my closing it's in my notes this is my closing thought to you brother Ryan how do you believe this message is so accurate we're 56 60 years later we're 50 60 years later I've been studying this since as a boy I stood at brother brandom's casket as a as a boy I've heard the tapes all my life but brother Ron Ron why are
