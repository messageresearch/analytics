[3:58] nervous about coming to being around you
[4:00] know when you're up here it's easy to
[4:01] say something's wrong so quick and my
[4:03] tongue is about five seconds ahead of my
[4:06] brain so so if I say something that
[4:08] ain't exactly right just wait five
[4:10] seconds and you'll get it yeah man but
[4:13] we're looking at and we see we see
[4:14] things moving we see God moving by his
[4:16] hand and a woman I wanna I'm gonna sing

[4:21] big it gets to be just a little bit less
[4:23] nervous and what I was and and what I am
[4:26] amen and what I will be hey man but we
[4:28] looking for God to come tonight amen and
[4:30] I was thinking about it and I said you
[4:34] know my mom she'd been gone for about
[4:35] three years now and you know we went
[4:37] through basically our churches just went
[4:41] totally just just it just flat bottom
[4:44] down flat line that you know people were
[4:46] worried about the church being stands
[4:48] going and staying moving and just go on
[4:51] moving you know and you look at and you
[4:53] said God has a purpose behind it you
[4:55] know and you you lose someone that's
[4:56] close to you and a leader it's it just
[4:59] just tears you right down into your
[5:00] bones and you know I looked at it and I
[5:02] said you know I said you know
[5:04] said but the miracle is we're still
[5:06] going hey man we're still going hey
[5:10] buddy we looking at and I said you know
[5:11] I got to thinking about the miracles in
[5:13] my life and I got to looking at the
[5:14] miracles it goes on around here and I
[5:16] seen God moving Claude has not changed
[5:18] his mind about his word if he healed one
[5:20] he'll heal again
[5:22] they better be saved one he'll save
[5:24] again if you fill one with the whole ago
[5:26] he'll fill another with the whole ago
[5:27] you just have to be willing to receive
[5:30] it into your life man let's get
[5:32] ourselves out of the way and let God
[5:33] move down by his spirit down upon our
[5:35] lives a man and I looked at it and I see
[5:37] I seen the church moving and I see
[5:39] people it was a million night brother if
[5:42] we came in and there was only two there
[5:43] but we had to and we lead up on that
[5:46] Scripture a lot and we leaned upon
[5:47] brother Brandon said we're two or three
[5:48] gathered in my name who would be in the
[5:50] mist Jesus Christ would be in the mist
[5:52] and when he's in the minister's nothing
[5:54] that can hold it back a man and I looked
[5:56] at that scripture we continue to
[5:57] rehearse that scripture we didn't have

[16:38] but we know if I hurt birth Lee House of
[16:42] this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a
[16:44] building of God and house not made with
[16:47] hands eternal in the heavens
[16:49] for if this in this we groan earnestly
[16:52] desiring to be clothed upon with our
[16:55] house which is from heaven if so be that
[17:00] being clothed we shall be found not be
[17:03] found naked for we that are also in this
[17:09] tabernacle do groan being burdened not
[17:12] for that which we we being unclothed but
[17:16] clothed upon that mortality might be
[17:18] swallowed up of life now he that hath
[17:22] brought a good good brought us for his
[17:26] self saying thing is God who hath also
[17:29] hath given unto us the earnest of the
[17:33] Spirit therefore we have all always are
[17:36] always confident knowing that while as
[17:39] we are at home in the body we are absent
[17:42] from the Lord for we walk by faith and
[17:45] not by sight we are confident I say and
[17:48] willing
[17:49] to be absent from this body and to be
[17:51] present with the Lord wherefore we
[17:53] labour that whether present or absent we
[17:56] may be accepted of him for we almost
[17:59] before appear before the judgment seat
[18:02] of Christ that every one may receive the
[18:05] things done in this body according to
[18:08] that he had done whether it be good or
[18:12] bad
[18:13] may the Lord at his blessings to his
[18:15] word tonight in mind and just asking you
[18:18] to be seated tonight if you can
[18:19] hey mind them and we're looking at it
[18:21] and we're seeing this and you know we
[18:23] look at this this earthly body groaneth
[18:25] for more than what we have right now you
[18:27] know as I was saying we we kind of wake
[18:30] up every morning as we get older younger
[18:32] people don't they you're learning
[18:33] they're jumping up and they're ready to
[18:35] go but we get older we wake up with one
[18:37] of the brothers one of the itis brothers
[18:39] a man and we we look at that we see that
[18:41] you know we got things hurting that
[18:43] didn't hurt yesterday you know but you
[18:45] look at you say well the groundhog
[18:46] didn't deliver the mail so I'm still
[18:48] here so we look at it we see God has
[18:50] given us or blessed us with another day
[18:52] blessings is not all the way in how much
[18:54] you have much money you have in your
[18:56] pocket I mean the blesses of God can
[18:58] come in a way that you don't need money
[19:00] to live a man he said he would supply
[19:02] your need all the time a man and we look
[19:04] at that but what we have to do is look
[19:05] beyond this vale of tears and then in
[19:07] looking to Jesus a man and he said
[19:09] brother Branham says it like it's right
[19:11] here said going away Jesus and I want
[19:13] you to look at this right tonight I want
[19:14] to say we're going beyond our own
[19:16] thinking a man what's that mean tonight
[19:18] to me that means that when we get to the
[19:20] end of our road that means you got to go
[19:22] a little further and man you got to look
[19:24] beyond your veil of Tears and you got to
[19:26] look beyond and see Jesus Christ on the
[19:28] other side because when you do that you
[19:30] realize you're getting this person out
[19:32] of the way I mean you're getting this
[19:33] person out of the way good to see you

[20:20] feeling inside their life that they knew
[20:21] not to bow down before that guy
[20:24] they met before that image amen it was
[20:26] because of the reason that they had it
[20:28] made you parents you've got a you got a
[20:30] responsibility to raise those children
[20:32] and it's still in their minds they need
[20:34] Jesus Christ more than anything this

[20:55] thinking I ain't gonna think like I
[20:58] think Lord I'm just going to think like
[21:01] you would think and you promised that
[21:03] when I was that I was healed and I think
[21:05] that I surrender my thinking I want no
[21:08] more think about my sicknesses I won't
[21:11] think about the disease I had I ain't
[21:13] thinking about nothing but thinking
[21:16] about what you said hey man what'd he
[21:19] say he said now right in front of you
[21:21] stay is the person that was just like
[21:22] you a few minutes ago you were sitting
[21:25] down but there is a well person standing
[21:28] there Jesus Christ is calling out to
[21:30] that well person right beyond it now you
[21:33] just have to have faith so close your
[21:35] eyes walk right into that well body and
[21:38] then you just keep right on a walk and
[21:40] hey man get it into your mind go beyond
[21:42] your own thinking Amen don't sit there
[21:44] and go whether this happened to this
[21:46] person or this happened to this person
[21:48] you know anybody you mash your toe well
[21:50] I've heard people dying from that you
[21:52] know I know you just look at it because
[21:53] somebody negative that's always gonna be
[21:56] around you I mean there's a lot of
[21:58] people that like the water on your fire
[21:59] and then they want to push you out oh
[22:01] whoops
[22:02] they go with it what they doing they
[22:04] trying to kill your face hey man but
[22:06] you've got to stand on your own two feet
[22:09] yeah oh god they are going to be there
[22:11] they go to people all around you all the
[22:13] time they gonna be looking at you saying
[22:15] well this is you yes what's gonna happen
[22:17] to you what happens you go I'm gonna
[22:19] rise above that and then I'm gonna rise
[22:21] above that evil that you're speaking
[22:23] about and I'm going to lean upon the
[22:25] word of God because I know this word
[22:27] lives and then it lives a man it lives
[22:31] within me a man the word was made flesh
[22:33] and lives within this body a man and you
[22:36] make it become so real that you even be
[22:38] go go beyond what this flesh thing say
[22:40] man there's two people here they mean
[22:42] you got a body that you live in
[22:43] it feels pain it sees the darkness of
[22:46] this world and Men but you also look at
[22:48] it inside of there there's Jesus Christ
[22:50] and you're so low a man and it looks
[22:52] beyond what even your flesh can think I
[22:54] don't care I'm gonna walk right on up
[22:56] and then I'm gonna keep moving right on
[22:57] up I mean you could die out just because
[23:00] y'all have seen people that'll just lay
[23:02] there and then that d-nev is sick you
[23:04] know I think you worked on when I'm a
[23:05] man you working for one I'm with her
[23:07] with the chimney sweeping and he what he
[23:10] did he retired and quit and laid down
[23:11] had a well body well body well bye I
[23:16] said I'm done but you know what in a few
[23:19] short days he couldn't move he found
[23:22] there having to feed him and take care
[23:24] of him if you don't move this body it
[23:26] will die if you don't move this word
[23:28] it'll die within you you need to make
[23:31] this word living you how do you make it
[23:33] live you eat it up you start reading it
[23:36] earnestly I'm contended that one day on
[23:38] this mortal I will live a mortal a man
[23:41] with this corruptible that comes on man
[23:43] - you ain't got nothing on me mmm but I
[23:46] have Jesus Christ on the inside that I
[23:49] have a new body coming to me you may be
[23:51] 83 you may be 86 you may be no ID you
[23:55] may be a hundred but it ain't nothing
[23:57] when you talk about eternity and an
[23:59] eternity with Jesus cry and then that's
[24:01] what I'm looking for life here is but a
[24:03] vapor get yourself ready so when that
[24:05] hour comes I mean you don't have to look
[24:07] around you can say I'm standing
[24:09] steadfast on the rock of Jesus cry amen
[24:12] the devil may come up against me but I
[24:14] know who's gonna win I know who's gonna
[24:16] win tonight a man that's Jesus cry he
[24:18] felt that battle
[24:20] he got himself Lord everything he had
[24:23] and put it into Jesus cry and meant that
[24:25] he could take all your sins he could
[24:28] take all your sicknesses he could take
[24:30] every thought that you have inside of
[24:31] your mind and he could take that and he
[24:34] can load it he could take that back to
[24:35] hell that you could live for him not
[24:37] just waiting on something but Jesus
[24:39] Christ himself also give you his life
[24:42] and then he gave you his life that when
[24:45] that battle comes you don't lean up on
[24:47] this flesh you lean upon what's on the
[24:49] inside that's Jesus Christ
[24:51] maybe he starts speaking to you and man
[24:53] as I heard the news about brother Ron I
[24:54] immediately went to prayer I went to
[24:57] thinking about those dark roads I mean I
[24:59] get to think about that but I said I
[25:00] know one it can lighten that path Amen I
[25:03] know one it can be there lighten that
[25:04] path and then I found myself in tears I
[25:07] praises to God a man that I know someone
[25:10] that can heal a man I don't have to lean
[25:12] up on this flesh saying this is going to
[25:14] happen I can lean up on the Bible and
[25:16] say this is what's gonna happen ever I
[25:18] thank God for that tonight give him
[25:20] glory tonight give him glory to your
[25:29] name and then we sing about him we're
[25:31] gonna talk about him here Amen but look
[25:34] I don't want to look at something right
[25:36] here Saint Peter puts it like this right
[25:37] here and then when I got I called that
[25:40] up and I said you ready to go with me
[25:41] down down there what's wrong he goes yep
[25:44] I saw him last you do something I said I
[25:47] want you to put on your floor we're
[25:50] going to battle we're going to battle
[25:52] don't come to a battle if you ain't got
[25:55] your shield on don't come to a battle if
[25:57] you ain't got your breastplate a face on
[25:59] hey man don't come to a battle if you're
[26:01] not ready
[26:01] remember when you step in front of them
[26:03] a man that David when he walked out to
[26:05] hurry man he looked at and he said he
[26:07] was just too big to miss hey man they
[26:10] talked about how big he was he was too
[26:12] big to miss hey man I'll look at that
[26:14] same way I'm gonna hit that devil right
[26:16] between the eyes tonight ever because I
[26:18] put on the whole armor what are you
[26:20] saying I say it like just right here and
[26:22] played you were listed Ephesians they
[26:23] meant finally my brethren be strong in
[26:25] the Lord and the power of his
[26:27] my putting on the whole armour of God
[26:29] that she may be able to stand against
[26:32] the wiles of the devil but we wrestle
[26:34] not against flesh and blood but against
[26:36] the principalities against the powers
[26:38] against the rulers of the darkness of
[26:40] this world against spiritual weakness in
[26:42] high places were four taken to you the
[26:45] whole armour of God that you may be able
[26:47] to understand in that evil day and
[26:50] having done all to stand stand therefore
[26:53] having your loins Girt about you with
[26:56] truth and having on the breastplate of
[26:57] righteousness and your feet shod with
[26:59] the preparation of the gospel of peace
[27:01] and above all take it on the shield of
[27:03] faith wherewith you'll be able to quench
[27:05] the fiery darts of the wicked a man may
[27:09] guqin quits those hurried art and when
[27:11] they come up against you you can look
[27:13] them straight in the eye and say greater
[27:15] is He that's within me that he's within
[27:17] you and that Jesus Christ is only inside
[27:20] a man and if you don't have him tonight
[27:22] find that peace a man because the world
[27:24] is coming to an end so quickly and then

[27:33] to go find yourself seeking more of
[27:35] Jesus Christ amen that God if he'd heal
[27:38] you tonight and then if he touches your
[27:40] body completely amen

[27:52] yesterday we need to know that if I
[27:54] should be gone tomorrow I will be in the
[27:56] presence of Jesus Christ a man that we
[27:58] need to know that my next step may be on
[28:01] those streets a man that I may be with
[28:03] my other ones that are looking over the
[28:04] balcony saying keep on the good work
[28:06] keep fighting the battle and man they're
[28:08] praying that you can stand the battle
[28:10] because they know there are fiery darts
[28:12] of the devil were upon you and you and
[28:14] you in each one of you can say they're
[28:15] up on us tonight but we need to be ready
[28:17] and I we need to be ready tonight a man
[28:20] there man we're looking at three Hebrew
[28:22] children we see them back in the Book of
[28:24] Daniel a man we see then we see a God
[28:27] talking about you know you say well well
[28:28] well they they got written down because
[28:30] they did something good no they got
[28:32] written down because they stood the test
[28:34] they stood the test they didn't back up
[28:36] they didn't go down on their knees a man
[28:38] we read
[28:39] scriptures all the time you know you
[28:40] could rehearse the Bible over and over
[28:42] again and what do they put in there is
[28:44] for you when you come up against that
[28:46] time when you're in fire you come up
[28:48] against the wall and you pray and it'll
[28:49] fall and then you're looking to these
[28:51] circumstances in life and what do you do
[28:53] you take it back to the word make it
[28:55] live inside of you and man we see them
[28:57] Nebuchadnezzar there he is he's looking
[28:59] at them he said there doesn't be little
[29:01] runts I mean there's nothing but these
[29:03] little kids it's up here and they wasn't
[29:04] old people they wasn't ready to die they
[29:07] were downer they knew what they were
[29:08] down there for a man they knew that that
[29:10] God was with them and they do the God of
[29:12] Abraham and know and they knew all of
[29:14] them and up but here they were standing
[29:16] there a man they didn't bow down they
[29:19] need him pay attention to him brother
[29:20] and said they was just right actually
[29:22] just praying one to another and you know
[29:24] you see that and you see it here and
[29:26] let's look at Daniel let's see Daniel
[29:28] what they're doing here it just for a
[29:30] moment just to recapture a man here he
[29:32] had called in Daniel had told to told
[29:35] the dream and the Nebuchadnezzar built
[29:37] up a huge image of him out there and he
[29:40] wanted he gathered in just not regular
[29:42] people he gathered in two great people
[29:44] he gathered in people that would
[29:46] influence huge if you didn't have the
[29:47] holy ghost inside idea that would make
[29:49] you think well they're better you know
[29:51] you look at that and you see that moving
[29:53] they're going on you know and you see
[29:55] all those influential people you know
[29:56] we've seen them the last few weeks in
[29:58] this impeachment trial amen you know I
[30:03] looked at that I said you know what I
[30:05] accomplished more than Congress did
[30:07] today and I said well there you go but
[30:12] you look at it what is that doing that's
[30:13] taking the eyes off of what you should
[30:15] be looking at and should be getting more
[30:16] into with the Word of God because
[30:18] there's going to be wars and rumors of
[30:20] wars and then shaking there's gonna be
[30:22] more earthquakes is going to be waves I
[30:24] mean well I heard that song ways
[30:25] overflowing and you know we never even
[30:27] thought about now tsunami has become a
[30:29] normal word think about it just a few
[30:31] short years ago tsunami was not even
[30:34] hardly known and now all of a sudden
[30:35] it's just a common word Jamaica has a
[30:38] seven point seven and you know a seven
[30:40] point seven it's down there what has
[30:42] happened it is it is seared our very
[30:44] thinking that this world is groaning
[30:47] looking for the soon return of Jesus
[30:49] Christ and it is looking to be made over
[30:52] why shouldn't we as Christians be
[30:54] looking to be made over her back be made
[30:56] into a new creation that one day will
[30:58] step from this in a moment in a
[31:00] twinkling of an eye to be called up and
[31:02] called away to be with Jesus amen and we
[31:05] look at this we see them near here they
[31:06] are they're coming down to their test a
[31:08] man and many have me ever faced the test
[31:10] hey Matt I have faced some tests a man
[31:12] we go through those tests and trials you
[31:15] know a test in school is to see what you
[31:16] learned in the past I have to be honest
[31:20] with you when I was in school most the
[31:22] time when they go mark what's the answer
[31:23] to that question I don't remember
[31:26] nothing I remember nothing there is
[31:30] nothing in this though pea-brain that I
[31:32] have that would even finitely think
[31:34] about what she was trying to say and
[31:36] miss Turner she was like wrong never
[31:39] like that mrs. wimbur was about this
[31:48] tall which she said you're never going
[31:53] to be like Ryan well I tell you what I
[31:57] may not be like him but we sure do have
[32:03] a lot of the same thoughts you said
[32:05] around long enough and he'll go I was
[32:07] just thinking that you know because
[32:09] that's way we are we're brothers we're
[32:12] brothers and sisters in Christ we don't
[32:15] have to worry about what each other's
[32:16] thinking cuz we're thinking about what
[32:17] God is getting ready to do for us a man
[32:19] and I look at these three little Hebrew
[32:21] children they're standing there they
[32:23] knew where they stood at they knew where
[32:25] they stood at and they were standing
[32:26] there and said no Nebuchadnezzar says
[32:28] bow down bow down I'm gonna toot the
[32:31] floor horns and I'm gonna play the harp
[32:33] someone to do all this stuff and go get
[32:34] all the music going and I want you to
[32:36] bow down and everybody in one Accord to
[32:38] be the big wigs and all them they
[32:40] started bowing down but there was three
[32:42] that didn't three them didn't you know
[32:45] somebody must have been not bowing
[32:46] completely because they said they ain't
[32:50] somebody wasn't completely fulfilling
[32:53] their needs of bowing down before their
[32:55] God but there was three that wasn't
[32:57] gonna bow before that car but they do
[32:59] praise the God hear my hand and we
[33:01] looked at it when we see them standing
[33:02] there and they're like
[33:03] he kindly comes over there he looks at
[33:05] the manipulation looked at and he said
[33:06] therefore because the Kings Commandments
[33:08] was urgent and the furnace was
[33:10] exceedingly hot and the flame of fire
[33:12] slew those men that took up Shadrach
[33:15] Meshach and Abednego we see them
[33:17] standing there he had gotten so mad that
[33:19] he heated it up seven times brother
[33:21] Brown said he had to take them back and
[33:23] put them back and let them stand so they
[33:25] could get that fire heated up hey man
[33:27] that's what the devil wants to do to you
[33:28] he wants to get that fire you made a
[33:30] well I survived that and I survived that
[33:32] but he next time he's coming by with our
[33:34] more heated fire and he's coming by with
[33:36] something bigger him the Goliath get
[33:38] bigger in her lives amen
[33:40] but he just gives you the same stone
[33:42] that's called the Word of God amen
[33:44] he don't have to change you know had to
[33:45] get bigger it's the Word of God is
[33:47] living on the inside a man his brother
[33:49] Rob was talking about seeing over here
[33:51] all right he's taking that thing and he
[33:53] was whooping it around like this right
[33:54] here that's what he's doing he's getting
[33:56] that word wound up to go hit that devil
[33:58] hey man to go get that devil why should
[34:00] we change now
[34:01] God has not changed a man and we see
[34:03] them standing there we look at him and
[34:05] matter brother Branham says elections
[34:07] right here he said they said now those
[34:08] Hebrew children I can notice them they
[34:11] were praying they didn't pray paying
[34:12] attention to that King they didn't fear
[34:15] his command they they wanted to know
[34:18] what thus saith the Lord
[34:20] and they turned their faces and prayed
[34:22] just the same just closely now all right
[34:25] to this decree was made then the King
[34:28] put his seal up on there he must keep it
[34:32] he was going to burn these three Hebrews
[34:34] I could hear Nebuchadnezzar will teach
[34:38] them holy rollers what to do around here
[34:40] we'll show them who's boss that's what a
[34:44] lot of Devils like to do a man a man I
[34:47] don't know I hope it's okay to say this
[34:48] they call it a call it kalfus and
[34:50] Nachman down there when you wreck you
[34:52] know they you say call kalfus and
[34:53] Nachman and they'll they'll have the
[34:55] other lawyers on they're going to
[34:57] they've heard kalfus and Nachman we
[35:00] better leave them alone give them
[35:02] whatever they want no it's time for us
[35:06] because that what that Devils going to
[35:07] do he's going to go I'm from the devil
[35:10] and his angels and I know what's going
[35:13] on
[35:13] I owned you since you were born

[35:19] together he will remind you of
[35:21] everything you've done wrong and he
[35:23] loves fishing he loves fishing in your
[35:26] mind he loves playing with your mind and
[35:28] he's sitting there going and we got you
[35:30] there's no way you could get out of this
[35:32] and all of a sudden you start realizing
[35:34] wait a minute
[35:36] I remember a day when I'm now down at an
[35:39] altar that was a knock came upon my door
[35:42] a harsh door he says whosoever shall
[35:45] open that door I shall come in and sup
[35:48] with him and I looked back and I said
[35:50] when I open that door Jesus come walking
[35:53] in he come walking into me and he
[35:57] changed me Oh devil and you're Satan and
[36:00] then you have no power over me Jesus
[36:03] Christ is walking within me amen and
[36:06] when I opened that door he closed it he
[36:09] put a little self of him in there man he
[36:12] put a little something in her that will
[36:14] stand up no matter what the devil says
[36:17] amen amen it says faith as a mustard
[36:19] seed a mustard seed is so small you can
[36:22] barely see it but you put it under
[36:24] concrete that booger will come up and
[36:26] then he will come crawling up out of
[36:28] there and you'll fight over every power
[36:30] that's trying to hold him down
[36:32] you too can fight over every Power if
[36:35] you have faith in Jesus Christ you have
[36:38] faith to believe you can receive and may
[36:42] give him glory to God and may give him
[36:45] low rent lifted up his name but we're
[36:48] here to lift up Jesus Christ name he
[36:50] went to battle for you he did it all for
[36:53] you and we need to realize that tonight
[36:56] why does he deserve all the glory and
[36:58] then I heard them songs and they're
[37:00] talking about how great God is he
[37:02] deserves all the glory he can make a way
[37:06] where there seemed to be no way he can
[37:08] open the door when there ain't no door
[37:09] and then he can change you completely
[37:12] Amen I thank God for that tonight a man
[37:14] and man hope this is good and then I
[37:17] hope it's meeting somebody's needs
[37:19] tonight Amen because I'm ready and then

[38:49] can talk and he was just irate he said I
[38:53] pity you going in there and talk to him

[39:12] where you're standing even without a
[39:14] Bible everybody you need to know that
[39:16] your foot is on the rock of Jesus Christ
[39:18] amen because you're going in there and
[39:20] you're gonna fight some Devils at this
[39:22] thing they say I ain't letting him go I
[39:24] had him his whole life
[39:26] and I stuck continue to talk to him I
[39:28] said you know I said you know just going
[39:30] through the scriptures and relaying it

[39:46] back to brother Branham he said that he
[39:47] said you know you raise a child up the
[39:49] way it should go
[39:50] you teach him about Jesus Christ that
[39:52] coming to church they will not stray
[39:55] from it that was what was going on with
[39:57] him because he is tormented within his
[39:59] own mind because he knew there was
[40:01] another place coming and he wasn't ready
[40:04] or prepared to go to there we sat there
[40:07] and prayed for all about 45 minutes of
[40:10] back-and-forth talking and praying and I
[40:12] kept watching him turning and he kept
[40:14] turning and so I said well are you okay
[40:16] and he goes I feel much better than I
[40:18] have in a while he said I appreciate it
[40:20] and I said well I said you know I said
[40:22] we will continue to pray for you I put
[40:26] his name in my Bible here they said from
[40:30] that moment until he died he was at
[40:35] peace the entire time he treated those
[40:38] nurses with the utmost respect he did
[40:42] what he could what was it there was a
[40:44] change come inside of his life that he
[40:46] knew that his heart was ready to go and

[46:40] still and know that I am THE LORD thy
[46:42] God amen brother Branham enclosing
[46:44] brother Branham says it like this right

[47:03] that's who I want to come on the scene
[47:05] tonight and man you uplifted those hands
[47:07] earlier you said I need something from

[47:24] most precious and divine Heavenly Father
[47:26] the heart nor we look under you Lord and
[47:28] we thank you Lord Jesus Lord then we can

[48:03] the heart give me faith in these muscles
[48:06] real hard Lord to dress severe over what
[48:08] the devil has in store nor do we can
[48:10] trample over him and have a testimony
[48:12] Lord just like those three Hebrew
[48:14] children Lord Lord as they stood during
[48:16] the fire they weren't worried about the
[48:18] fire they were more interested in
[48:20] getting to know you before Lord I'm
[48:22] praying Lord as we're standing in the
[48:24] heat Lord Lord may we find herself
[48:25] yearning for more of Jesus Christ inside
[48:28] of her alive more of the life of you
[48:30] living inside of us Lord Lord that's
[48:32] just not a feeling Lord that we forget
[48:34] when we walk out the door but something
[48:36] that goes home with us Lord is something
[48:38] that we wake up with in the morning Lord
[48:39] there is something when we wake up we
[48:41] dread to see another day you're there
[48:43] giving us a soft hand to raise us about
[48:46] that bed Lord and as they go make
[48:48] another step hard be a lighthouse Lord
[48:50] I'm praying Lord you'd minister to each
[48:52] needs or our Lord the uplifted hands
[48:54] will heart Lord we're yearning for more
[48:56] of you Lord going beyond the own
[48:58] thinking of our own minds or our own
