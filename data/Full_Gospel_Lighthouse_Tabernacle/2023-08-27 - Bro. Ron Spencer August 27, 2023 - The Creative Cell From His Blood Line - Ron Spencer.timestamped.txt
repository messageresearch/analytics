[21:56] Spencer if he would just come and pray
[21:58] over these needs if he would this
[22:00] morning
[22:02] [Music]
[22:07] let's just Bauer heads
[22:10] gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're so
[22:13] thankful to come and gather here again
[22:14] once this morning and just so thankful
[22:16] for your anointing that came last night
[22:18] and just fell all across this building
[22:20] and I it's hard for me to believe that
[22:23] anyone that was within the walls of this
[22:25] building could not fill your presence
[22:26] Lord and as brother Andrew came and he
[22:29] just he just preached the anointing and
[22:30] the inspiration that you gave him and I
[22:33] just ask that you would do that once
[22:34] again this morning as our pastor comes
[22:36] and he would just preach the anointing
[22:38] that that falls this morning and even if
[22:40] it takes him off his notes I just ask
[22:42] that you would just anoint the service
[22:43] like never before there's many needs as
[22:46] each and every one of the prayer
[22:47] requests have been read off this morning
[22:49] and Lord Jesus as I would listen to The
[22:51] Prophet just the other day as he would
[22:53] speak he would he would speak about how
[22:55] if we would if we would look back on
[22:57] Noah's day we might as well send our
[22:59] children to just go do architecture do
[23:01] something in the world today but we
[23:03] believe in a god of today and I would
[23:06] and go to say that if we would look back
[23:07] and worship a God and that was back in
[23:09] the 60s Lord we could go and send our
[23:12] children to do the same thing but we
[23:14] believe the god of of today and brother
[23:16] Branham came and he just he showed us
[23:18] the example and showed us that the word
[23:20] is here to live and you're the same
[23:21] yesterday today and forever Lord I just
[23:24] ask that you would just come and you
[23:25] would comfort those that are there with
[23:27] sister Pearl Barry's family as she would
[23:29] go on before the curtain and Lord Jesus
[23:31] we're going to see her again one day and
[23:33] each and every one of our loved ones
[23:35] that have went on before us you've just
[23:37] picked wildflowers and soon one of these
[23:39] days we'll see them come back in their
[23:40] new bodies and we'll transform ourselves
[23:43] Lord Jesus we know what's so close the
[23:45] darkness is all around but Lord Jesus I
[23:48] just ask that you would just light our
[23:49] candle once more this morning and light
[23:51] our candle that we could just shine
[23:53] brighter than ever in this darkness of
[23:55] world that we could just walk out and it
[23:57] doesn't it doesn't take much to walk out
[23:59] in the streets today and see the
[24:00] darkness that's Among Us Lord Jesus I
[24:03] just ask that you'll allow us all to be
[24:04] a living example of you even when even
[24:07] when there's hate all around us allow us
[24:09] to be the one that stands out and shows
[24:11] love to those that may not have love
[24:13] shown to them before for they may be the
[24:15] very last one that may come home Lord
[24:18] Jesus we just thank you for all that
[24:19] you're doing for us we thank you for
[24:21] about what you're going to do this
[24:23] morning through this prayer line and
[24:24] through the service we just thank you
[24:26] for all that you are doing in Jesus name
[24:28] we pray amen
[24:33] amen at this time we'll receive
[24:36] this morning's offering you give us
[24:38] God's blessed you and then as they're
[24:41] preparing to take up the offer we'll
[24:42] have brother Stephen short if you
[24:44] prepare to come sing for us if it would
[24:45] then brother Gabriel Sister Sarah says
[24:48] to Whitney
[24:49] they'll prepare also just a couple
[24:52] announcements after uh

[24:56] remember the times of the services is
[25:00] Friday at 7 Saturday at 6 and Sunday at
[25:05] 11. so won't you just turn and tell your

[25:15] and then on Sunday there will be a meal
[25:19] to follow afterwards at Spotswood High
[25:22] School once again like we did last year
[25:25] and then also if we could have our youth
[25:29] and anyone able to park over the hill
[25:32] during the labor day services that would
[25:35] be greatly appreciated saving as much
[25:37] space up top as we can
[25:40] and then also if he wasn't not here last

[25:53] had a little bit of a speech for conduct
[25:56] and church order there so if he wasn't

[50:44] sister Peril Berry we were able to see
[50:47] her just before her homegoing the day
[50:50] before she left and
[50:52] and of course many of you know that she
[50:54] was she had had a stroke and she was out
[50:56] of it hadn't been able to speak for
[50:58] quite a while I hadn't actually even
[51:00] looked at anybody in any way we walked
[51:03] into the house the other day with sister
[51:05] Loretta and her eyes came open popped
[51:09] open I was able to talk to her and I
[51:12] said Jesus is getting ready to walk into
[51:14] this room and going to take you home now
[51:16] don't you be afraid he's coming you've
[51:19] lived the life preparing for it
[51:21] Loretta her daughter we had led her to
[51:24] the Lord sometime back and she said I
[51:27] want to get baptized in the name of the
[51:28] Lord Jesus Christ and I told sister
[51:30] Pearl I said sister Pearl your daughter
[51:33] wants to get baptized in the name of the
[51:35] Lord Jesus Christ and tears started
[51:37] running down her face and so we're just
[51:40] so thankful for that
[51:49] our hearts are sad because she's went
[51:51] home but our hearts are joyful
[51:54] we wouldn't dare want to bring her back
[51:57] into this world she's she's a young lady
[51:59] now she doesn't she doesn't have to
[52:02] worry about sickness or anything like
[52:04] that they will have the visitation
[52:06] tonight at six o'clock so if the service
[52:08] is over you're welcome to go
[52:12] and so it it will be at Johnson's
[52:15] funeral home at Bridgewater and then

[52:19] o'clock at the same place Johnson's
[52:21] funeral home at Bridgewater brother
[52:23] Andrew and myself will be taking care of
[52:25] that service and so if you would
[52:27] remember us in prayer amen
[52:30] I would like to thank you for all the
[52:32] birthday wishes we made it
[52:35] we made it and made another birthday and
[52:38] so we're just thankful for that
[52:42] so thankful
[52:48] thank you for all the cards and the well
[52:50] wishes and everything and
[52:52] you just don't know what that meant for
[52:55] me to turn 62.
[52:57] because I looked very much like a
[52:58] president that lived and I very much
[53:01] loved him because of a lot of things
[53:03] that he did creating national parks and
[53:06] things and actually your Social Security
[53:08] that you get he was one of the creators
[53:10] of that and he wasn't able to Institute
[53:13] it and so his name was Theodore
[53:16] Roosevelt Teddy we call him and that's
[53:20] where your teddy bears come from but but
[53:22] anyway he lived to be 61 and you can
[53:25] imagine how many times the devil
[53:27] whispered in my ear through my 61 period
[53:30] but I made it
[53:41] so we're just thankful for that
[53:44] amen so we'd like to thank you and maybe
[53:46] we can find 63 in our in our future if
[53:49] the Lord don't come back and and take us
[53:51] home and so amen thank you for all your
[53:54] prayers through this this lengthy
[53:55] process and you know he said if you'll
[53:58] trust me I'll use you like never before
[54:00] and so I don't know particularly how
[54:02] long this trial will be but he's in
[54:04] control of it and so you know I just put
[54:07] it all in his hands amen maybe we just
[54:10] like to have a need before God and say

[56:34] I'd like to speak to you today
[56:38] and I'll try my best to be as brief as I
[56:40] can but I want to drive the point on the
[56:43] creative cell
[56:45] from his bloodline
[56:48] amen
[56:54] Mark chapter 16 and verse 15.
[56:59] now this is his these are some of his
[57:02] closing words to his most Inner Circle
[57:06] and he said unto them
[57:08] go ye into all the world
[57:10] and preach the gospel to every creature
[57:14] and he that believeth
[57:16] and is baptized shall be saved
[57:20] but he that believeth not shall be
[57:23] damned
[57:24] and these signs shall follow them that
[57:26] believe
[57:27] in my name
[57:29] shall they cast out devils and they
[57:32] shall speak with new tongues and they
[57:35] shall take up serpents and if they drink
[57:37] any deadly thing it shall not hurt them
[57:41] they shall lay hands on the sick
[57:44] and they shall recover you may be seated
[57:48] and we say Amen
[57:53] I'd like for you to read this portion of
[57:55] scripture with me Isaiah chapter 53 and
[57:59] verse 1.
[58:01] and we will read right down through
[58:03] verse 5.
[58:05] and I want you to read it with me if you
[58:07] will
[58:08] who hath believed our report
[58:11] and to whom is the arm of the Lord
[58:13] revealed
[58:15] for he shall grow up before him as a
[58:18] tender plant and as a root out of dry
[58:20] ground he hath no form nor comeliness
[58:23] and when we shall see him there is no
[58:26] beauty that we should desire him
[58:29] he is despised and rejected of men a Man
[58:33] of Sorrows acquainted with grief and we
[58:37] hid as it were our faces from him he was
[58:40] despised and we esteemed him not
[58:43] surely he hath borne our griefs and
[58:46] carried our sorrows yet we did esteem
[58:49] him stricken and smitten of God and
[58:51] Afflicted but he was wounded for our
[58:54] transgressions he was bruised for our
[58:58] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[59:01] was on him and with his stripes we are
[59:05] healed
[59:07] can we read that last verse again
[59:10] but he was wounded for our transgression
[59:13] he was bruised for our iniquities the
[59:17] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[59:20] and with his stripes we are healed
[59:27] if you'll notice there's no time stamp
[59:29] date there of expiration
[59:33] that was not Isaiah's words that was the
[59:36] spoken word of God
[59:39] Isaiah was a prophet which is a Seer he
[59:43] was the mouthpiece of God he would write
[59:46] it down under direct inspiration of God
[59:49] so this is God's word to you and I
[59:54] wounded for our transgressions
[59:58] 800 years before he would take those
[1:00:01] stripes at pilate's judgment Hall
[1:00:04] bruised for our iniquity the
[1:00:07] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[1:00:10] and with his stripes we are healed I
[1:00:16] want you to think about it not only as
[1:00:18] Believers we believe it but Satan he can
[1:00:21] read as well
[1:00:25] he should have known it was coming
[1:00:29] but he couldn't stop it
[1:00:33] I want you to just think about those
[1:00:35] things how powerful that they are
[1:00:38] this brother
[1:00:41] of
[1:00:42] casteth out all fear
[1:00:46] and when fear is gone faith is perfect
[1:00:51] I love that don't you when fear is gone
[1:00:54] faith is perfect
[1:00:57] and he swore by himself he said now
[1:01:00] listen I'm going to say something look
[1:01:02] faith is unconscious
[1:01:05] he said I've learned that through the
[1:01:07] years of travel around the world and
[1:01:10] meeting people of all different kind of
[1:01:12] walks by faith but faith is unconscious
[1:01:16] you got faith that you don't even know
[1:01:18] about
[1:01:21] Jesus Christ no matter if he was in a
[1:01:24] storm and the Gale was knocking the boat
[1:01:26] from one side to the other and he was
[1:01:29] standing in the face of demons
[1:01:32] he was hanging anywhere it never moved
[1:01:36] him he walked right on just as calm and
[1:01:40] as quiet as he could be
[1:01:42] he was simply unconscious of fear
[1:01:47] whether it was going to happen or
[1:01:49] whether it wasn't going to happen he
[1:01:52] knowed it was going to happen because
[1:01:54] God said so I love that don't you
[1:01:57] and you're here today to fulfill it as
[1:01:59] well just walk unconscious of fear
[1:02:04] walk unconscious of criticism walk
[1:02:08] unconscious of the world walk as you
[1:02:11] walk in Christ walk with him
[1:02:14] not paying any attention to the right or
[1:02:17] to the left hand just walk and just keep
[1:02:20] moving on if something comes into church
[1:02:23] walk with God if sickness strikes for
[1:02:27] you walk with God if the neighbor don't
[1:02:30] like you walk with God
[1:02:33] and just keep walking with God Enoch
[1:02:36] walk one day one day walk like that and
[1:02:41] you know what he's done he walked all
[1:02:44] the way home with God
[1:02:46] he got so far up the road he didn't come
[1:02:49] back anymore I love that don't you
[1:02:51] walk with God the doctor tells you that
[1:02:55] you're going to die walk with God
[1:02:58] the doctor says you can't get well walk
[1:03:02] with God
[1:03:03] just walk with God that's all for God
[1:03:06] has promised I'll never leave you I'll
[1:03:10] never forsake you I'll be with you to
[1:03:12] the end of the world
[1:03:14] and he looked and he took an oath and by
[1:03:18] that Covenant he'd give it to you that
[1:03:22] he confirm it just walk with God
[1:03:28] I think that's so powerful
[1:03:30] now notice he gives us some just down
[1:03:33] home advice you're going to have to go
[1:03:35] through your ups and downs
[1:03:39] you're going to go through some Briar
[1:03:41] patches
[1:03:42] you're going to go over some sharp rocks
[1:03:44] over some Bluffs down on the hillside up
[1:03:48] on the mountains over Waters
[1:03:51] but walk with God
[1:03:53] you're going to have to go through all
[1:03:54] of that but just keep walking with God
[1:03:58] that's the song says there's so many
[1:04:00] Hills to climb
[1:04:01] he said upper you've heard that old song
[1:04:04] but how little it'll seem when you get
[1:04:06] to the end of the way
[1:04:08] this world is kind of what you would
[1:04:10] call silly stuff
[1:04:15] Hallelujah another man said brother and
[1:04:18] sisters he said we have an abstract
[1:04:20] title deed
[1:04:22] we have an abstract title deed tonight
[1:04:24] to Salvation and to Divine Healing
[1:04:27] and the devil has no rights trust God
[1:04:30] and the Holy Ghost to put him out
[1:04:35] he said I feel religious tonight somehow
[1:04:37] I really do he said notice God has
[1:04:40] promised it and God's obligated to take
[1:04:43] care of it
[1:04:45] and this blood cell where he formed
[1:04:48] moved into the womb and covered himself
[1:04:51] over with his own creative blood cell he
[1:04:55] said brought forth the son Christ Jesus
[1:04:58] the blood cell was broken at Calvary and
[1:05:02] the blood round down over his body in
[1:05:05] order that he could bring back into
[1:05:08] himself Fellowship
[1:05:11] well who does he want to have fellowship
[1:05:13] with
[1:05:19] uh I like that don't you
[1:05:22] his blood did not come from any mortal
[1:05:25] man
[1:05:27] but it came from the creative power of
[1:05:30] Jehovah God
[1:05:32] his father he was divine he proved that
[1:05:36] when he broke the seals of death and
[1:05:39] Rose up the third day he proved it
[1:05:45] I like it when God decides to prove his
[1:05:48] own words
[1:05:50] Tyler good to see you today
[1:05:53] now we're not saved by Blood of a Jew
[1:05:58] or the blood of a gentile
[1:06:01] we're saved by the blood of God
[1:06:04] and we say Amen he was God and it was
[1:06:08] nothing else
[1:06:10] he wasn't a Jew and he was an egyptah
[1:06:14] God's creative blood in him we become if
[1:06:19] he was a Jew or a gentile we're all lost
[1:06:23] he was God In the Flesh
[1:06:27] I don't worship a Jew I worship God
[1:06:31] I worship Jesus Christ I don't worship
[1:06:34] some fiction or some kind of a
[1:06:36] historical something I worship Jesus
[1:06:39] Christ the presence of Jesus Christ
[1:06:42] right now which is his word that's
[1:06:45] manifested in this age
[1:06:48] I like Hebron how he brings it up 2 000
[1:06:51] years now his manifested word in this
[1:06:55] age that's what we're worshiping
[1:06:58] we're not worshiping the prophet
[1:07:02] that God veiled in that's not what we're
[1:07:05] worshiping we're worshiping Jesus Christ
[1:07:08] the message was not the message of
[1:07:11] William Branham it was the message of
[1:07:13] the Lamb
[1:07:15] now Jesus was the fullness of God's word
[1:07:18] he was the fullness of the godhead
[1:07:20] bodily and in him dwelled the fullness
[1:07:23] of God God lived in Jesus Christ God was
[1:07:27] in Christ reconciling the world to
[1:07:30] himself not a Jew nor a gentile but God
[1:07:35] there's he stood making himself how
[1:07:38] fitting and God's own blood had to shed
[1:07:43] upon the ground from the innocent blood
[1:07:46] of Abel on down to the innocent blood to
[1:07:50] redeem us
[1:07:51] he didn't take his own life
[1:07:56] he didn't even hold his own life he said
[1:07:59] father if it's possible
[1:08:03] let this cup pass from me but
[1:08:06] nevertheless
[1:08:08] not my will but thy will
[1:08:12] be done
[1:08:15] now I just I'm just sharing a few quotes
[1:08:17] with you and no doubt as I read Isaiah
[1:08:21] 53. and we just told you that when the
[1:08:25] word is spoken Satan's always close
[1:08:29] but isn't it amazing that he can't stop
[1:08:32] God's word from being fulfilled
[1:08:37] now
[1:08:39] he's on his way for a resurrection
[1:08:42] and a body change for rapture
[1:08:45] this message has been telling us that
[1:08:48] you are going to get a physical body
[1:08:52] change
[1:08:53] now we can look back to Abraham and
[1:08:56] Sarah
[1:08:57] and we can remind the devil there was
[1:08:59] nothing you could do to stop that
[1:09:02] we can remind him that when Jesus came
[1:09:05] to hell and he had the keys and he told
[1:09:08] him he said give me the keys so Satan
[1:09:12] knows today he's just the bluff
[1:09:15] he don't have the keys to his own house
[1:09:20] he don't have arrows for his own bow and
[1:09:23] throughout the seals as they're being
[1:09:25] revealed day by day
[1:09:28] he can't stop the seals from being
[1:09:30] revealed and we know once the seals are
[1:09:33] revealed there's a bride's Revival
[1:09:35] that's going to be released on the Earth
[1:09:38] and it's going to have results to it
[1:09:42] because when the prophet dies the
[1:09:44] message isn't going to die
[1:09:46] it's going to spread through all the
[1:09:48] world
[1:09:49] and people of the character of the word
[1:09:52] is going to be produced
[1:09:57] you are the living physical attributes
[1:09:59] of God you're the ones that was in the
[1:10:02] Lamb's Book before the foundation World
[1:10:04] God took a picture of you
[1:10:07] at your best are you with me now
[1:10:10] and then you were manifested in flesh
[1:10:12] through your mother and father but that
[1:10:15] wasn't your origin
[1:10:17] I love my mom and dad but that wasn't my
[1:10:20] origin the real me came from the Lamb's
[1:10:23] Book
[1:10:24] so that means that you are the spoken
[1:10:27] word seed of God
[1:10:30] that means that you are the mystery of
[1:10:34] Jesus Christ in Bride form
[1:10:37] that means that you are people of the
[1:10:41] open book
[1:10:43] we're not a church
[1:10:46] we're not just a gathering of people we
[1:10:50] are the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:10:54] Hallelujah I want you to give the Lord a
[1:10:56] hand right there
[1:11:07] brother Jason once we catch that
[1:11:09] Revelation there's nothing that the
[1:11:10] devil can do to stop us
[1:11:15] once we catch that that Revelation that
[1:11:18] we realize that we are as Eternal as
[1:11:21] Jesus Christ is eternal
[1:11:25] I'm trying to behave here at the first
[1:11:27] but I want you to realize once you catch
[1:11:30] that you are the spoken seed of God
[1:11:34] that that the devil can only go so far
[1:11:37] with you he can make you sick he can
[1:11:39] make you Afflicted he can get in your
[1:11:41] spirit and contaminate you get you
[1:11:43] nervous get you your temper riled up he
[1:11:46] can only he can go through your
[1:11:47] Affliction through your affections he
[1:11:50] can go through your emotions but he
[1:11:52] can't not get to that seed of God
[1:11:53] [Applause]
[1:11:56] he cannot get there
[1:12:05] now watch this
[1:12:07] now Satan watches this message go forth
[1:12:12] and this message has exposed him
[1:12:16] so now you become a threat to his
[1:12:20] kingdom
[1:12:24] now I'm going to say that again so you
[1:12:26] catch this
[1:12:27] Satan watches this message going forth
[1:12:31] as long as it's just in book and take
[1:12:34] form
[1:12:35] it doesn't bother him whatsoever but
[1:12:38] once it comes in flesh
[1:12:41] Silver and Gold Have I None are you
[1:12:44] catching this Upper Room didn't bother
[1:12:46] the devil whatsoever but Silver and Gold
[1:12:49] Have I None but such as I have give I
[1:12:51] Thee in the name of Jesus Christ rise up
[1:12:55] and walk
[1:12:58] once this message becomes action
[1:13:03] once it becomes action and it's living
[1:13:06] on the earth
[1:13:08] you become a threat
[1:13:11] can we say that you are Satan's worst
[1:13:15] nightmare
[1:13:18] oh
[1:13:19] turn to your neighbor I want this to
[1:13:22] come from your lips I am Satan's worst
[1:13:25] nightmare
[1:13:36] how many has ever had a nightmare
[1:13:40] you got a nightmare it's okay it's okay
[1:13:43] because of the chemo and a lot of the
[1:13:45] drugs that I'm on and the seizure
[1:13:46] medicines it produces nightmares I am
[1:13:50] absolutely thrilled to wake up
[1:13:55] I am thrilled to wake up whether it's
[1:13:58] five o'clock six o'clock whatever time
[1:14:00] it is I actually slept over this morning
[1:14:02] I'm happy
[1:14:05] and so so when I wake up
[1:14:09] I am so happy
[1:14:12] so happy
[1:14:14] that that wasn't reality
[1:14:20] I am so thrilled
[1:14:23] Satan can't wake up from this nightmare
[1:14:28] Glory
[1:14:37] now you're a threat to the kingdom
[1:14:40] so we realize that
[1:14:43] as he watched brother Branham
[1:14:45] speak
[1:14:47] just as he watched Jesus speak and he
[1:14:50] contested Jesus he contested brother
[1:14:52] Branham he contested us as ministers the
[1:14:55] fivefold of this message
[1:14:58] you know there's something that he can
[1:14:59] identify
[1:15:03] the voice that was in Jesus
[1:15:07] he watched that voice
[1:15:09] say Let There Be
[1:15:14] I want you to catch that
[1:15:16] and the voice in Jesus said I have power
[1:15:20] to lay my life down
[1:15:23] and power to take it up again
[1:15:27] I and my father are one
[1:15:32] though your sins be many
[1:15:39] you are forgiven
[1:15:42] who would be the most thankful Simon
[1:15:47] the one with sins many
[1:15:50] so I want you to just notice and I want
[1:15:52] to drive this
[1:15:53] in a moment
[1:15:56] in a moment by the spoken word from God
[1:16:01] she went from a harlot
[1:16:04] a defile woman
[1:16:08] a womb that had many seeds in a moment
[1:16:12] those desires left her
[1:16:15] and sin dissipated
[1:16:18] and she was not that same woman anymore
[1:16:31] that voice behind The Voice
[1:16:36] no doubt Satan watched Three Squirrels
[1:16:40] be spoken into existence
[1:16:43] no doubt he watched the storm
[1:16:48] literally turn and go back
[1:16:52] he watched as Hattie Wright said that's
[1:16:56] absolutely the truth brother Branham
[1:17:00] now I want you to just notice just for a
[1:17:02] moment she had said in his church all
[1:17:04] those years and now she's going to take
[1:17:08] the voice behind the voice and let that
[1:17:10] boy speak through her
[1:17:13] and she's going to operate the third
[1:17:16] pull
[1:17:18] she could have had millions of dollars
[1:17:20] she could have had her sister healed but
[1:17:22] she asked for the Eternal part
[1:17:26] she went past first pull second pull she
[1:17:29] she asked for something that was eternal
[1:17:33] and she asked for her two boys
[1:17:40] now listen she bypassed sexual desire
[1:17:45] and ask for something that was
[1:17:48] Supernatural
[1:17:50] her two boys
[1:17:53] she spoke
[1:17:55] eternal life to her two boys
[1:18:01] and there was nothing Satan could do
[1:18:05] to stop it
[1:18:13] Billy Andrews stood on this platform
[1:18:15] many years ago danced all over the place
[1:18:19] and he said if he said if there's not
[1:18:21] but two boys in heaven I know who's two
[1:18:24] boys that that will be
[1:18:30] Hallelujah now remember when Moses was
[1:18:33] standing there
[1:18:34] and it was crying to God
[1:18:37] brother random is using this sermon for
[1:18:39] an example to the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:18:41] what are you crying to me for
[1:18:44] speak
[1:18:48] why are you crying why are you looking
[1:18:50] at the temporary situation speak
[1:18:54] you got to go over there speak and go
[1:18:57] over Stretch Your Rod out across the sea
[1:19:00] it had never happened ever before
[1:19:05] and he stood there and stretched his Rod
[1:19:07] across the sea and what happened an
[1:19:10] impossible situation became possible
[1:19:14] they did not walk across in mud
[1:19:20] two million people begin to take steps
[1:19:24] the water wind came and separated the
[1:19:28] water
[1:19:28] [Music]
[1:19:30] it was a voice that was behind The Voice
[1:19:34] it did not make Moses God but there was
[1:19:37] God living on the inside
[1:19:40] [Applause]
[1:19:41] your flesh
[1:19:44] you're a flash that you fight your flesh
[1:19:47] and your spirit that contends with you
[1:19:49] but there's a God on the inside of you
[1:19:52] that controls your flesh and controls
[1:19:55] your emotions
[1:19:59] so don't look at your temporary
[1:20:01] situation
[1:20:03] don't let it give you the moly groups
[1:20:06] you do not have to be prisoner
[1:20:09] in your own body
[1:20:15] now notice God is in his word and I've
[1:20:18] already read to you that he's obligated
[1:20:20] to back his word up and he'll prove it
[1:20:23] now Satan is always standing near
[1:20:27] trying to defeat the plan of God
[1:20:33] he's always real close trying to defeat
[1:20:36] the plan of God
[1:20:38] but notice this message
[1:20:41] makes such bold statements
[1:20:44] it's beyond human understanding
[1:20:48] I've been working on this message for a
[1:20:50] little while so you can tell it
[1:20:52] this message is the creative word
[1:20:56] of God
[1:20:59] it is the manifested word because it has
[1:21:03] produced a manifested people
[1:21:08] now the vision of that boy in Finland
[1:21:11] was two years in the making
[1:21:14] so if we can say that many of our lives
[1:21:18] many I tried to preach this is Sister
[1:21:20] Connie from one sofa to the other sofa
[1:21:24] but let me just say a lot of these
[1:21:27] events
[1:21:28] have been decades in the making
[1:21:32] they're decades in the making and here's
[1:21:36] a boy lay on the ground crushed by a car
[1:21:39] somebody has driven that car somebody's
[1:21:41] made a a decision to drive down the road
[1:21:44] at a certain time here's a boy and now
[1:21:47] he's laying on the ground but God's got
[1:21:49] a provision
[1:21:51] way before they've ever heard and maybe
[1:21:53] never heard of William Branham but God's
[1:21:55] got a vision
[1:21:57] that this boy is going to come off of
[1:21:59] the ground and be totally healed
[1:22:02] now I want you to just think about this
[1:22:04] is what I want you to get
[1:22:06] not just back on his feet
[1:22:08] but 100 percent
[1:22:13] healed
[1:22:15] he hasn't heard the seals he hasn't
[1:22:17] heard the way of a true prophet he
[1:22:19] definitely hasn't heard that anointed
[1:22:22] once at the end time but God is going to
[1:22:24] take a creative word
[1:22:27] notice what he says if he's not off of
[1:22:29] the ground in five minutes you call me a
[1:22:32] false prophet
[1:22:36] come on people that want to fight the
[1:22:39] message today where was you at
[1:22:42] where was you at
[1:22:46] people that want to fight it in our day
[1:22:48] in our area listen you can't stop this
[1:22:51] church
[1:22:53] for those that left it didn't stop this
[1:22:55] church
[1:23:11] I'm gonna say something very distinctful
[1:23:13] here and I mean it too sometimes God has
[1:23:15] to throw the seed in the air and sin
[1:23:17] went through it
[1:23:20] to get the trash out of it
[1:23:29] brother wrong bear you calling those
[1:23:30] people trash brother Branham called the
[1:23:33] world fodder
[1:23:36] fodder people that are actually giving
[1:23:39] you trouble situations on your job
[1:23:41] situation let me just say don't get
[1:23:44] yourself too carried away
[1:23:46] Don't Let It Blow weeks and months away
[1:23:49] they are fodder
[1:23:54] their fighter Fighter for the burning
[1:24:07] I want that to settle
[1:24:10] because they turned down the creative
[1:24:13] word of God
[1:24:17] now
[1:24:19] this message is the
[1:24:22] is the Breath of God
[1:24:25] it's the Breath of God
[1:24:27] now I want you to just think about the
[1:24:29] power of statements
[1:24:32] and I just want to I want to get you I
[1:24:33] want to catch your attention
[1:24:35] the power of a statement
[1:24:39] and just to kind of get you to a point
[1:24:42] to where that
[1:24:44] I'm just going to bring in a carnal
[1:24:46] realm first
[1:24:47] there was a man that stood at Gettysburg
[1:24:50] and he spoke for two hours
[1:24:53] two hours
[1:24:55] before Abraham Lincoln spoke
[1:24:58] two hours
[1:25:00] 99.9 percent of us don't know his name
[1:25:04] and don't even know what he spoke
[1:25:07] but the man after him was Abraham
[1:25:09] Lincoln
[1:25:11] a tall man over six foot tall very
[1:25:14] Slender the war had created much stress
[1:25:17] in his life now Abraham's looking like
[1:25:19] an older man but he's a Statesman
[1:25:23] there's a sermon that has come from
[1:25:25] Spurgeon to actually actually stir his
[1:25:29] heart
[1:25:30] it's time to end this thing
[1:25:33] and actually from that sermon
[1:25:36] he called the nation to pray
[1:25:40] he actually called the nation to pray
[1:25:42] that this war would end
[1:25:47] how profound that was we actually live
[1:25:50] in actually the Bread Basket of that war
[1:25:53] families against families
[1:25:56] Terror against each other brothers
[1:25:59] fighting Brothers Listen families
[1:26:01] turmoiling but let me just say prayer
[1:26:05] changes things
[1:26:08] and he stood and gave the Gettysburg
[1:26:10] Address which is known as one of the
[1:26:12] greatest addresses that there's ever
[1:26:14] been spoken I could care less where
[1:26:17] you're a Republican or where you're
[1:26:18] Democrat but let me just say this to you
[1:26:20] this man was the man for the moment
[1:26:24] and from that moment our nation began to
[1:26:28] heal
[1:26:29] there would be a lot of other skirmishes
[1:26:31] there will be a lot of other Wars that
[1:26:33] take place but from that moment he spoke
[1:26:36] it and released words that would bring
[1:26:39] healing to our nation
[1:26:42] when this message was spoken by our
[1:26:45] Prophet it was telling us that the bride
[1:26:48] is on the scene and God is announcing in
[1:26:51] the astronomic heaven he's showing that
[1:26:55] the infant bride is on the Earth
[1:26:57] and if we were in our infancy when the
[1:27:00] prophet we must be in our maturity as we
[1:27:02] stand here today
[1:27:06] this message has brought results
[1:27:11] notice in just a statement I have power
[1:27:14] to lay my life down and power to take it
[1:27:17] up again did he prove it
[1:27:20] give me the keys to death Hell In The
[1:27:23] Grave did he prove it
[1:27:25] father forgive them
[1:27:30] my kingdom is not of this world
[1:27:33] go thy way and sin no more
[1:27:37] in a moment from those words those
[1:27:40] people were never the same ever again
[1:27:45] brother on that happen when Jesus was
[1:27:47] here but what about when God speaks to
[1:27:49] your life
[1:27:51] and you walk into this building and you
[1:27:54] have vowed many times I'm going to make
[1:27:56] a change I'm going to make a change
[1:27:59] but when God supernaturally touches your
[1:28:02] life Mary
[1:28:04] when he supernaturally touches your life
[1:28:07] and that seed is born on the inside of
[1:28:11] you under the right atmosphere
[1:28:16] under the right atmosphere
[1:28:19] you're forever changed
[1:28:22] you may live in the same house you may
[1:28:24] live and look like the same guy but
[1:28:27] there's a new King on your heart
[1:28:29] no man did that no Jew did that
[1:28:33] no Gentile did that no preacher did that
[1:28:37] God did that
[1:28:39] [Applause]
[1:28:43] Mary believe the angel
[1:28:45] what he spoke to her
[1:28:48] she was going to get water
[1:28:51] and she met Gabriel
[1:28:53] she walked to that place of Virgin
[1:28:58] she walked away pregnant
[1:29:04] be it unto me
[1:29:05] according to Thy Word
[1:29:09] from that moment
[1:29:11] from that testimony
[1:29:14] she was hate
[1:29:20] can I drive it
[1:29:23] from the moment
[1:29:24] she walked she was in the scriptures
[1:29:28] Behold a virgin shall conceive
[1:29:31] D she never got a sermon that you're the
[1:29:34] girl
[1:29:37] but when the angel met her
[1:29:40] and told you told her what his
[1:29:42] salutation was to be
[1:29:44] that God was going to produce on the
[1:29:47] inside of her the creative blood cell of
[1:29:50] God
[1:29:51] I want you to think how profound this is
[1:29:55] From This Moment every sin since Adam
[1:30:00] was put on notice it's over
[1:30:03] it's over
[1:30:06] can you imagine the blood of bulls and
[1:30:08] goats that blood could produce Rivers
[1:30:11] but it can only cover sin
[1:30:16] but this Blood
[1:30:19] this spoken word blood
[1:30:21] this just a small amount of sales that
[1:30:25] was inside of her womb couldn't revoke
[1:30:28] the jurisdiction of Satan forever
[1:30:44] never beat yourself over the back for
[1:30:47] what the sins that you did before
[1:30:50] because once this blood takes a Colt in
[1:30:52] your life you're not the same person
[1:30:55] anymore
[1:31:06] this creative blood
[1:31:08] you walk to an altar and you're filthy
[1:31:11] of sin
[1:31:14] you're sitting in your car you're on
[1:31:16] your couch and you invite Jesus into
[1:31:19] your heart and you feel a supernatural
[1:31:22] touch
[1:31:23] whether you feel him or whether you
[1:31:25] don't it's not about your feelings it's
[1:31:27] not about your an even your your
[1:31:30] emotions
[1:31:32] Mary felt nothing
[1:31:35] she didn't that she didn't shout she'd
[1:31:38] felt nothing she just said be it unto me
[1:31:42] according to Thy Word
[1:31:52] and it was nothing Satan could do
[1:31:55] from that point
[1:31:57] Satan knew he saw the angel
[1:32:02] listen people around didn't see the
[1:32:03] angel but he did
[1:32:07] and Satan could link the scripture up
[1:32:11] but now he couldn't stop it
[1:32:13] I'm preaching to you now I want you to
[1:32:15] get this you'll walk down that aisle in
[1:32:17] a little bit walk down Sick
[1:32:23] walk down unsaved walk down backslidden
[1:32:27] but in the right moment
[1:32:31] in the right moment Rebecca
[1:32:33] you were pleading for the Holy Ghost
[1:32:36] but this morning you can say it I got it
[1:32:40] [Applause]
[1:32:55] two weeks ago Aaliyah was praying at the
[1:32:58] altar with hundreds of others and the
[1:33:01] Lord told me to go to her and I went to
[1:33:03] her
[1:33:04] and I went to her again and I went to
[1:33:06] her again on the fourth time he spoke to
[1:33:10] me and said you you wait there
[1:33:13] and the door is going to come open
[1:33:16] and I began to pray and I began to watch
[1:33:19] when God sends you he's on business
[1:33:23] and that thing got broken in her life
[1:33:27] that thing got broken in her life and
[1:33:29] she walked to that altar one way and she
[1:33:31] walked away different
[1:33:33] and on Saturday night she got the Holy
[1:33:35] Ghost because flesh had been conquered
[1:33:40] you got to die out to yourself God's not
[1:33:43] going to live in a contaminated vessel
[1:33:46] You Gotta Die out to yourself first of

[1:38:06] moments here
[1:38:07] America is destined for war with Russia
[1:38:13] they're destined you could put
[1:38:17] Federalists as a president
[1:38:19] Independence in his precedent
[1:38:24] you could put Biden back in in president
[1:38:26] you'd be an idiot but
[1:38:30] you could put Donald Trump back in
[1:38:32] president and I'll repeat that verse
[1:38:34] that I just said to you
[1:38:38] my trust is not in Donald Trump it's not
[1:38:40] in Joe Biden
[1:38:46] my trust is not in none of these guys
[1:38:51] it's not in any of them
[1:38:55] this nation is cursed because a prophet
[1:38:57] stood here and said it was cursed
[1:39:01] this nation is headed for war
[1:39:06] this nation is headed for war there's
[1:39:09] nothing you and I can do to stop it

[1:39:18] do what he's going to do
[1:39:20] the pope is destined to do what he's
[1:39:23] going to do
[1:39:24] but we are destined

[1:39:41] we are destined
[1:39:45] we're destined to get a body change
[1:39:50] they're destined
[1:40:00] the words the spoken word that you are
[1:40:02] receiving
[1:40:04] through a prophet through preachers
[1:40:08] you're listening to the voice that is
[1:40:09] behind the voice
[1:40:12] it's not talking to your flesh
[1:40:16] because your flesh will be tired at
[1:40:18] times
[1:40:19] it'll be weary you'll get up and have a
[1:40:22] bad morning and you'll walk in
[1:40:28] brother on how do you know that
[1:40:31] I was laying
[1:40:34] in a condition
[1:40:36] to where I was non-responsive
[1:40:41] I had been burned
[1:40:43] I was been a coma
[1:40:45] I was non-responsive
[1:40:47] it was like the light went out
[1:40:50] and my last thought before being
[1:40:52] non-responsive I thought this must be
[1:40:55] what it's like to die
[1:41:01] no doctor on the Earth would give me a
[1:41:03] chance
[1:41:04] but there was a man walked into this
[1:41:06] pulpit
[1:41:08] and he preached two sermons called God's
[1:41:11] Hall of Fame
[1:41:13] and he preached another sermon
[1:41:16] called God will have a testimony
[1:41:21] and for over 15 years I've stood in this
[1:41:24] pulpit and proclaimed the Gospel of
[1:41:27] Jesus Christ
[1:41:29] because there was a spoken word cell
[1:41:34] how many of you were in this church when
[1:41:36] brother Tim Pruitt preached that sermon

[1:41:48] night and I want you to just think about
[1:41:50] this

[1:42:01] you walk into this service expecting the
[1:42:05] supernatural catch of God
[1:42:12] I'm going to say something I'm going to
[1:42:13] take it a little bit deep here for you
[1:42:15] you just catch your breath
[1:42:17] but these are the best of the best of
[1:42:20] the best of of all of time
[1:42:22] [Music]

[1:42:53] inside of you to hear the voice of God
[1:42:58] foreign

[1:43:10] dealing more than just an earache or a
[1:43:11] toothache or or a cancer listen we're
[1:43:15] talking about a body change
[1:43:18] I want you to be in condition in the
[1:43:21] moment

[1:43:27] your life

[1:43:45] your wrinkles are going to go away your
[1:43:48] back is going to straighten up I'm
[1:43:50] talking about the creative cell of God
[1:43:54] creative cell of God that is spoken to
[1:43:57] your GNC on the inside of you it's going
[1:44:01] to respond
[1:44:05] Hallelujah
[1:44:16] this is much greater than a caribou this
[1:44:19] is much greater than a silver tip
[1:44:20] grizzly bear this is much greater than a
[1:44:23] storm
[1:44:24] [Applause]
[1:44:55] the body of Homer Frazier
[1:44:58] is laying in a tomb
[1:45:03] founder of this church
[1:45:05] that God spoke to to build this place
[1:45:15] he's not laying in that to him
[1:45:17] that's a body
[1:45:20] he's standing in a well body
[1:45:24] but he longs to come back to this realm
[1:45:27] everything he preached
[1:45:31] he can't wait
[1:45:33] his father
[1:45:35] his mother his family
[1:45:39] stands in that realm and I'm only just
[1:45:41] picking them out just now my father my
[1:45:45] mother
[1:45:48] not gonna be it's not going to be
[1:45:49] caskets rolling out and getting open
[1:45:53] not gonna be Angels digging their bodies
[1:45:56] out of the ground
[1:45:58] they're not there
[1:46:01] that's a house they lived in
[1:46:03] God's Gonna raise them
[1:46:06] they're going to step a half step this
[1:46:08] way we're going to take us half a step
[1:46:10] that way
[1:46:10] [Applause]
[1:46:13] by the creative blood cell of God
[1:46:20] how powerful are these services
[1:46:23] brother duck can tell you how powerful
[1:46:24] they are
[1:46:27] one moment he was dead and one moment he
[1:46:30] was alive
[1:46:36] probably one of the strongest families
[1:46:38] in this church is The Meadows Family
[1:46:41] but that man was on his way to commit
[1:46:43] suicide
[1:46:44] and the creative blood of God stopped
[1:46:47] him
[1:46:49] and here he sets 90.
[1:46:51] two
[1:46:54] 91.
[1:46:56] think about that
[1:46:57] and in a moment Young
[1:47:02] [Applause]
[1:47:29] brother random is standing

[1:47:42] brother Ron I didn't see it it don't
[1:47:44] matter

[1:47:50] other squirrel he couldn't find
[1:47:52] the devil wrestled with him all night
[1:47:54] long
[1:47:55] even to the place that he went back and
[1:47:57] he couldn't find it thinking it would be
[1:47:58] in a certain spot
[1:48:03] and he wretched into a hole can you
[1:48:06] imagine what it felt like when the tail
[1:48:09] he felt the tail of that squirrel
[1:48:12] and the devil had wrestled with him all
[1:48:16] night
[1:48:17] because of the spoken word of God he'd
[1:48:20] spoke it where it would be and he shot
[1:48:22] it and it ran into a hole and the devil
[1:48:25] devil wrestle with him I'm coming to an
[1:48:27] end
[1:48:29] he wrestled with him all night thinking
[1:48:31] it's not going to be but he knew what
[1:48:33] that creative power was one two three
[1:48:38] and now he can't find that third one and
[1:48:40] the devil's wrestling with him
[1:48:43] he's wrestling with him he's testified
[1:48:45] now the devil's wrestling with him now
[1:48:47] even others are questioning things
[1:48:53] but when he got a hold of it

[1:57:26] after I was burned and
[1:57:28] they were going to harvest my organs in
[1:57:30] five hours
[1:57:32] I had need of them
[1:57:36] I'm going to let the doctors testify to
[1:57:39] you now my lungs were burned
[1:57:43] and doctor had told me they were burned
[1:57:46] to a crisp
[1:57:48] when I got cancer in my lungs
[1:57:51] they told me that the cancer
[1:57:55] has not affected my lungs it's only
[1:57:58] hanging on to him
[1:58:00] your lungs are so perfect
[1:58:20] brother Ron but you you're taking chemo
[1:58:22] that's no Miracle really

[1:58:37] Josh but he walked in across his legs
[1:58:38] and he said you are a miracle
[1:58:42] and he says if anybody tells you that
[1:58:44] you're not a miracle because of chemo he
[1:58:46] said I want you to go out there and walk
[1:58:48] up and down these Halls all of these
[1:58:50] people are on the same chemo
[1:58:52] most of them after a year are dead or
[1:58:54] they're in a wheelchair

[1:59:12] lives on the inside
[1:59:13] [Applause]
[1:59:24] can I have 30 more seconds
[1:59:26] what you feel here
[1:59:29] is not created by man
[1:59:34] it's not something that we attempt in
[1:59:36] the back room to work up
[1:59:39] no man's in control of this no matter
[1:59:42] where you live or what church you go to
[1:59:46] this is the bride's Revival and the
[1:59:49] angel of the Lord himself is here to
[1:59:52] make sure it's fulfilled
[1:59:54] not another messenger is coming
[1:59:58] if brother Branham came back in the
[2:00:00] resurrection we have no sermons to
[2:00:02] preach it's already been preached
[2:00:11] it's him
[2:00:14] your faith is not in Ron Spencer Andrew
[2:00:16] Spencer Donnie Reagan Tim Pruitt any of
[2:00:19] your favorite preachers
[2:00:20] it's in Jesus Christ
[2:00:23] no man can heal you
