[23:23] throne of grace this
[23:26] morning
[23:29] [Music]
[23:31] let's just bow our
[23:33] heads gracious Heavenly Father Lord
[23:36] we're so thankful to be able to come and
[23:37] gather again this morning and we're so
[23:39] thankful for the word last night and
[23:41] just to be able to hear how powerful we
[23:43] can be and how we can use our tongue for
[23:46] greatness and use our tongue to speak to
[23:48] speak your presence into the atmosphere
[23:50] Lord and we just know that we are armed
[23:53] and dangerous Lord and we can use that
[23:55] to speak healing we can use that to
[23:57] speak to speak blessings upon others
[23:59] lives Lord and we just ask that we would
[24:01] take that message and let it live Lord
[24:04] and sometimes it may just be speaking it
[24:06] over our life so we can walk and we can
[24:08] have others see your light shine through
[24:10] US Lord because without you there's
[24:12] nothing we can do and we are no one Lord
[24:15] and Lord Jesus as these prayer requests
[24:17] are brought before you there's great and
[24:18] many needs and we see Satan is battling
[24:21] many and battling in the organs and and
[24:23] organs that we need to be able to
[24:25] survive Lord but Lord You've designed
[24:27] our bodies that healing is in our body
[24:29] and we just ask and speak that the great
[24:32] healer would come down and you would be
[24:34] with each and every one of the needs and
[24:35] these little ones that are at home sick
[24:37] and not feeling well the parents are at
[24:39] home and they're they're trying to take
[24:40] as best care of them as they can and um
[24:43] there's only so much we can do at times
[24:45] and but the greatest thing we could do
[24:46] is just as we're doing now and lift
[24:48] their names in prayer Lord I just ask
[24:51] that you would just you would come and
[24:52] be with us this morning in the building
[24:54] and just come and be with us that we may
[24:57] be able to draw dra n to you tonight
[24:59] Lord and Lord we just we know that
[25:01] there's great there's great battles
[25:02] Among Us and even great mental battles
[25:05] that are going on and Satan is coming
[25:07] and he's causing great spiritual battles
[25:09] just as there's a physical battle going
[25:10] on in Israel just now and Lord Jesus I
[25:13] just ask that you would draw our faith
[25:15] even higher because even when it seems
[25:17] there is no way Lord Jesus if we just
[25:19] lean upon your arms lean upon your wings
[25:22] you'll carry us over the battles and
[25:24] you'll carry us through every every
[25:26] stricken thing that we go through Lord
[25:28] and I just ask that you would just come
[25:29] and touch us and even in these temporary
[25:32] situations that we're in allow us not to
[25:34] make a permanent decision just because
[25:36] the temporary battle that we are in
[25:38] allow us to continuously fight fight the
[25:41] good fight of faith and fight to be a
[25:44] good believer and fight for the word
[25:45] that you have given us in this hour this
[25:48] is the hour there's nothing left after
[25:50] this but the Rapture and we know what
[25:52] comes after that we don't want one left
[25:54] behind but Lord Jesus I ask at each and
[25:56] every one we could just search our Our
[25:57] Lives search our lives for anything that
[26:00] may be unlike you and allow us to be
[26:02] able to come clean this morning clean

[39:07] seated at this moment for a little
[39:09] bit got a little bit of a treat this
[39:11] morning for you I know several have uh
[39:13] kind of seen the video clip of uh dad's
[39:16] hunt this this past week but we want to
[39:20] share it with you this morning as a
[39:21] congregation I know it's it might not
[39:24] seem churchy but
[39:27] hey we enjoy it so so I want to
[39:30] preference preference the the clip this
[39:32] morning as uh we started this trip in
[39:36] 2020 after uh the diagnosis of dad the
[39:41] brain surgery everything he's been
[39:43] through as a bucket list trip and uh
[39:48] so we got in touch with brother Andrew
[39:51] coffee which is brother Barry coffey's
[39:53] son and we knew he had some
[39:55] recommendations for guys and places to
[39:57] go for hunting trips and uh we just said
[40:00] you know where is a good spot kill a big
[40:02] buck have a good time and just do this
[40:05] for Dad and so he
[40:07] recommended Ben platner from Timberland
[40:10] Outfitters and I'm not trying to
[40:11] recommend this for anybody I'm just
[40:13] telling you the the story here but so we
[40:17] we got in contact with Ben and told his
[40:22] situation dad situation there and uh
[40:25] what we wanted to do because Time s felt
[40:30] like it was slipping away pretty fast
[40:31] there you know but the Lord had other
[40:34] plans and uh so we arranged a trip in
[40:38] 2020 and it was a spur of the moment we
[40:41] had I think it was four days to prepare
[40:44] brother Gabe myself and dad went on this
[40:47] trip to
[40:48] Illinois and uh we get there and dad
[40:51] does as usual and becomes the the
[40:54] celebrity the politician and and
[40:56] everybody's best friend in Camp and uh
[41:01] they just became family immediately
[41:03] there and um Ben and his mother Mo and
[41:09] then Ron they uh they run the camp there
[41:12] and and one of the first things I
[41:13] remember walking into the the lodge
[41:16] there uh Ron was standing there not my
[41:19] dad but uh the Ron that's there at the
[41:22] campy says now now her name is Mo and
[41:24] mine's Ron but we're not Mo Ron
[41:27] it just mow and run so immediately I
[41:30] knew I was at home you
[41:32] know cuz you had Three Stooges come in
[41:35] the
[41:37] camp but uh so this this trip became uh
[41:42] came a yearly trip for us after that
[41:44] because we made made more than friends
[41:47] but we made family and that's what uh
[41:50] they have become to us and it's hard to
[41:52] believe that you can go into a hunting
[41:54] camp and you can then not preach a
[41:58] sermon as dad was saying last night but
[42:01] we lived one and we've we've prayed with
[42:04] men there
[42:07] and I have I have seen the power of God
[42:10] fall upon men and give confession their
[42:12] life over to the Lord Jesus Christ there
[42:15] amen and that's that's bigger than any
[42:18] buck that could ever been killed
[42:20] there you know deer hunting is deer
[42:22] hunting but we're talking about eternal
[42:24] life that's right and and that's what
[42:26] this trip has become for us to to be
[42:29] able to be a witness of what our Lord
[42:31] Jesus Christ can do and uh so we began
[42:35] this trip and every year that we have
[42:38] went it's not worked out for Dad it's
[42:41] worked out for several others brother
[42:42] Davy is killed there brother Alden
[42:45] brother Gabriel Brother Malachi Andrew
[42:47] and myself have killed there but it just
[42:49] never seemed to work out for dad you
[42:52] know not that he
[42:53] was disappointed that we all killed one
[42:57] but we wanted him to kill one just as
[42:59] much as we wanted to kill one there and
[43:02] uh but so it never worked out but I just
[43:05] want to say this year the Lord provided
[43:08] for him and uh you might not seem that
[43:11] it's supernatural thing but the deer up
[43:14] there are very hard to kill and uh for
[43:17] Dad his situation they tried to put him
[43:20] on one but this year it worked out and
[43:24] we thank the Lord for that and and we
[43:26] wanted to share that with you this
[43:27] morning and and uh so that you can be a
[43:30] part of it too because you are a part of
[43:32] it we're family here and we have have
[43:34] eternal life together and we'll just
[43:37] tell it all over there all the little
[43:39] details of every little thing but we
[43:42] want to share this with you this morning

[51:41] as you can tell it was quite an
[51:42] emotional time for us and I thought as I

[51:48] incredible thing when Abraham looked up
[51:50] and God gave him a ram in the
[51:53] bushes and uh uh God does those things
[51:57] for us and hunting is hunting and so we
[52:01] were so blessed and they're they're all

[58:35] Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he
[58:39] maketh me to lie down in green pasture
[58:42] he leadth me beside the Still Waters he
[58:45] restoreth my soul he leadth me in the
[58:49] pth of righteousness for his name's sake

[59:15] the days of my life and I will dwell in
[59:18] the house of the Lord forever Romans
[59:21] chap 8 and verse 28
[59:25] some of my favorite
[59:28] scriptures
[59:29] amen could we read this together this
[59:32] morning again and we know that all
[59:35] things work together for the good to
[59:38] them that love God to them who are the
[59:41] called according to his purpose for whom
[59:44] he did for know he also did predestinate
[59:47] to be conformed to the image of his son
[59:50] that he might be the firstborn among
[59:52] many Brethren and more moreover whom he
[59:55] did predestinate them he also called and
[59:59] whom he called them he also Justified
[1:00:02] and whom he justified them he also
[1:00:04] glorified what shall we then say to
[1:00:07] these things if God be for us who can be
[1:00:11] against us he that spared not his own
[1:00:14] son but delivered him up for us all how
[1:00:18] shall we not with him also give us all
[1:00:22] things who shall lay anything to the
[1:00:25] charge of God's elect it is God that
[1:00:29] justifieth who is he that condemneth it
[1:00:33] is Christ that died yay rather that is
[1:00:36] risen again who is even at the right
[1:00:39] hand of God who also maketh intercession
[1:00:42] for us who shall separate us from the
[1:00:46] love of Christ shall tribulation or
[1:00:50] distress or persecution or famine or n
[1:00:54] nakedness or Peril or sword as it is
[1:00:58] written for thy sake we're killed all
[1:01:00] the day long and we're accounted a sheep
[1:01:03] for a Slaughter nay in all of these
[1:01:06] things we're more than conquerors
[1:01:08] through him that loved us for I am
[1:01:11] persuaded that neither death nor life
[1:01:14] nor angels nor principalities nor powers
[1:01:17] nor things present nor things to come
[1:01:20] nor height nor depth nor any other
[1:01:23] creature shall be able to separate us
[1:01:25] from the love of God which is in Christ
[1:01:28] Jesus our lord may God bless the reading
[1:01:32] of his word won't you turn to somebody
[1:01:34] and say I love you in the love of the
[1:01:37] Lord

[1:04:47] Zion we you and his family and all of
[1:04:50] our
[1:04:53] families as I entered I saw Katie grab
[1:04:56] her mother
[1:04:58] dabie they were screaming and
[1:05:02] jumping and she kept saying I told you I
[1:05:08] believed we were all so
[1:05:11] excited Katie is
[1:05:14] beautiful but I've never seen her that
[1:05:23] beautiful
[1:05:25] it blew me away with the whole
[1:05:27] thing our young girls were dancing
[1:05:30] circles and holding
[1:05:33] hands I saw such a Caren with all of
[1:05:36] their
[1:05:39] family it was a feeling Beyond a
[1:05:43] feeling the announcement was wa made
[1:05:46] over a seem like a system saying this
[1:05:49] Voyage means
[1:05:53] something
[1:05:57] I thought I was being lifted William and
[1:06:00] all of his children with
[1:06:03] us and as far as I could
[1:06:06] see all of us as
[1:06:11] Believers was standing there
[1:06:16] together I literally thought like I was
[1:06:18] leaving the
[1:06:22] room little did I I know in a few
[1:06:25] moments that later we would we would get
[1:06:28] that
[1:06:31] animal I believe we've come to a time
[1:06:33] where we've turned a
[1:06:36] corner that everything that we' preached
[1:06:39] and everything that we've talked about
[1:06:41] we're getting ready to experience
[1:06:44] amen Israel is in a fight for their
[1:06:48] life they're in a fight for their
[1:06:51] Nation they're in a fight they don't
[1:06:54] don't realize they don't realize even
[1:06:57] sometimes what they're fighting
[1:07:00] for but God is with
[1:07:03] them God is with
[1:07:05] them I made this statement last night be
[1:07:09] careful this is more than a political
[1:07:11] battle
[1:07:13] amen there'll be a lot of people that'll
[1:07:15] be killed and
[1:07:18] destroyed but God's greater than the
[1:07:21] human
[1:07:22] element is greater than all of that even
[1:07:25] as I said last night in one day God
[1:07:27] killed 85,000 people that came to fight
[1:07:31] against
[1:07:32] Israel sometimes we get kind of caught
[1:07:34] up against different things and
[1:07:37] different get pulled different ways but
[1:07:40] let me just remind
[1:07:43] you God is on those Jews
[1:07:46] [Music]
[1:07:49] side and in the big picture we're going
[1:07:52] to live there right
[1:07:54] amen what they're fighting over you and
[1:07:57] I are going to live there all right Amen
[1:08:01] in just the short matter there's going
[1:08:02] to be two prophets that'll come back to
[1:08:05] those Jews and they're going to preach
[1:08:07] in that land and so what the
[1:08:09] Palestinians are wanting is the piece of
[1:08:12] property called that that is the The
[1:08:15] Mountaintop to where that that the
[1:08:17] Temple Mount is there and so they all
[1:08:20] believe listen it's a it's a thousands
[1:08:23] of years old war and that's what you're
[1:08:26] seeing is is all of those Nations will
[1:08:28] gather against
[1:08:30] Israel thank God that our nation for
[1:08:33] this moment is standing with Israel
[1:08:36] because that means that we as a nation
[1:08:39] will be blessed and we as a people will
[1:08:41] be blessed but all of that should tell
[1:08:43] us that we must get ready The Old Ship
[1:08:47] of Zion is
[1:08:52] coming it's coming men is of with your
[1:08:57] family remind in your devotions at home

[1:09:42] morning in the scripture reading I want
[1:09:44] to read a couple of scriptures to
[1:09:47] you

[1:09:54] from the love of Christ and I want you
[1:09:56] to notice these next words and that's
[1:09:59] verse 36 sister Stephanie who shall
[1:10:02] separate us from the love of Christ

[1:10:10] famine or nakedness or perilous
[1:10:13] sword as it is written for thy sake

[1:10:18] counted as sheep for a Slaughter nay in
[1:10:21] all of these things
[1:10:24] we're more than
[1:10:26] conquerors through him that loved
[1:10:32] us this is a prayer and I'll share it
[1:10:34] with you Lord Jesus Christ you're the
[1:10:37] name that is above every name you're the
[1:10:41] name that like a fortified Tower in
[1:10:44] which I can find Safety and Security
[1:10:47] when I am troubled I can find peace in
[1:10:50] your name when I am weak I can find
[1:10:52] strength in your name when I am
[1:10:54] overwhelmed I can find rest in your name
[1:10:58] when I am surrounded by pressures on
[1:11:00] every side I can find stability in your
[1:11:03] name your name is Beautiful Lord help me
[1:11:07] to rely on you through the Jesus Christ
[1:11:10] Our Lord
[1:11:13] amen last night I just told a little
[1:11:15] story and I'll share it with you again
[1:11:17] this morning there was a little boy
[1:11:19] standing on a street corner he was
[1:11:21] standing there stomping his foot amen
[1:11:24] and somebody walked up to him and said
[1:11:27] what are you stomping your foot for and
[1:11:29] he says I'm keeping away
[1:11:33] elephants and the fell said you know he
[1:11:35] said there's not an elephant for
[1:11:38] thousands of miles away from here
[1:11:39] they're in they're in Africa he said I'm
[1:11:42] doing a good job ain't
[1:11:44] I
[1:11:48] amen you know you can't fight somebody
[1:11:51] else's
[1:11:52] trial you sure can't do that and so many
[1:11:55] times we go well if I was him or if I
[1:11:58] was
[1:12:00] her well you really don't know what you
[1:12:02] would
[1:12:04] do Paul the Apostle had a condition with
[1:12:08] his eyes and it oozed those eyes oozed
[1:12:11] with with great they would swell and
[1:12:13] they would actually come to a place to
[1:12:15] where they he would almost become blind
[1:12:17] with it and here he was preaching Divine
[1:12:20] Healing he's the first prophet he seen
[1:12:24] the pillar of fire some some term it
[1:12:27] even brother brandom and brother
[1:12:29] bossworth had a disagreement over what
[1:12:31] it really was some said it was was a
[1:12:33] condition of an allergy some said it
[1:12:35] because he saw the pillar of fire it
[1:12:37] caused it regardless of what caused it
[1:12:40] he had to deal with it the scripture
[1:12:43] said that he prayed Thrice that this
[1:12:46] condition would leave him and as he
[1:12:49] prayed God reminded him that my grace
[1:12:54] is sufficient for
[1:12:58] you I don't have Paul's battle and Paul
[1:13:01] don't have my battle but God's grace and
[1:13:05] many of you go through trials that I
[1:13:07] don't know how you make it through and I
[1:13:09] just pray for you but God's grace is
[1:13:13] incredibly sufficient for you listen
[1:13:15] it's his strength that we need every day
[1:13:18] of our life we come from the southern
[1:13:21] area and we we are still fighting the
[1:13:24] Civil War here it's the way it seems
[1:13:26] sometimes but Stonewall Jackson was one
[1:13:29] of our great great generals and brother
[1:13:32] Brown terms him like the Joshua of that
[1:13:36] day he says and it was at a battle of
[1:13:39] the American Civil War that a general as
[1:13:43] Stonewall
[1:13:44] Jackson how was it that he kept so cool
[1:13:48] while the B buets was literally being
[1:13:50] rained down Jackson instantly became
[1:13:54] grave and earnestly
[1:13:57] answered my
[1:13:59] religion belief teaches me to to feel as
[1:14:03] safe in the
[1:14:05] battle as in my
[1:14:09] bed that's quite a statement is it God
[1:14:12] has fixed the time of my death I do not
[1:14:17] concern myself about that but to always
[1:14:20] be ready and after a pause he added
[1:14:24] looking at his questioner in the face
[1:14:27] that is the way that all men should
[1:14:31] live and then all men be equally
[1:14:38] Brave understand
[1:14:40] this Jesus was not a
[1:14:44] philosopher he was not searching for
[1:14:47] truth he was
[1:14:49] truth he was not a Mystic he was
[1:14:54] reality he was not a reformer he was the
[1:14:58] creator he was not a
[1:15:01] Visionary he was the light of the world
[1:15:05] he never reasoned he
[1:15:08] knew I think this is so powerful amen he
[1:15:12] was never in a
[1:15:14] hurry he was never afraid he never
[1:15:17] showed weakness he never hesitated he
[1:15:21] was always ready he was always sure
[1:15:25] there was shess in all that he said or
[1:15:28] he did he had no sense of sin or need of
[1:15:32] forgetfulness forgiveness he never
[1:15:35] sought or needed
[1:15:37] advice he knew why he
[1:15:41] came he knew from whence he came he knew
[1:15:45] who he was he knew the father he knew
[1:15:49] the about heaven he knew where he was
[1:15:52] going
[1:15:54] he knew humankind he knew Satan he had
[1:15:57] no lack he had no
[1:16:00] limitations he was the very Creator was
[1:16:04] Jesus Christ we are in Christ we are the
[1:16:08] members of him Jesus had no fear he had
[1:16:11] no defeat he did not shrink from Pain
[1:16:14] and brutal treatment he was the
[1:16:18] master and when they arrested him he was
[1:16:21] the master at his trial he was
[1:16:24] Almighty yet he was just a man and that
[1:16:28] man lives inside of
[1:16:34] us quite a
[1:16:36] statement Veterans Day as we look at it

[1:22:07] martyred for being a missionary and it
[1:22:10] was found on his

[1:22:19] Mortals subject
[1:22:21] ourself
[1:22:24] to the almighty to the court of
[1:22:29] reason our night times will last only so
[1:22:35] long before it's swallowed up by the
[1:22:38] morning and the light will shine
[1:22:47] again our fight might be
[1:22:51] difficult it might be hard but morning's
[1:22:55] going to
[1:22:56] [Music]
[1:23:01] come this
[1:23:04] sermon was
[1:23:06] sparked by a girl named
[1:23:11] Ella Ella was born and had a stroke when
[1:23:15] she was
[1:23:16] born it's caused great difficulty in her
[1:23:20] muscular and even in her bone
[1:23:23] Ella's one one of the most
[1:23:25] beautiful girls that I've ever known
[1:23:28] she's brother bisco's
[1:23:33] granddaughter she has a character as
[1:23:36] beautiful as she
[1:23:38] is and just before just before I go any
[1:23:42] further I've had a lot of time with her
[1:23:44] and her
[1:23:46] family and she has not allowed her
[1:23:51] debilitation
[1:23:53] to characterize
[1:23:56] her she could have laid in a bed and be
[1:24:01] waited on the rest of her life but she's
[1:24:04] in college she has a
[1:24:07] job and she
[1:24:09] sits she sits and many times in a
[1:24:12] wheelchair she tries to
[1:24:16] walk but she could sit on the porch and
[1:24:19] I sat on the porch with her and her
[1:24:21] grand Dead Brother Ed and many of her
[1:24:23] family was sitting there and she quoted
[1:24:26] more
[1:24:27] scriptures and more quotes of the
[1:24:30] prophet and I thought to myself in her
[1:24:35] condition she shakes every devil in
[1:24:42] hell she had sent me a text the other
[1:24:45] morning that meant a lot to
[1:24:50] me and I said Center ATT text the next
[1:24:54] day and I said I thought much about your
[1:24:57] words in your
[1:24:59] life Ella you are a
[1:25:03] hero if somebody here would just that
[1:25:06] has her would you just send her a text
[1:25:08] you might want to listen to the
[1:25:10] sermon you are a
[1:25:12] hero it would be easy for you to make
[1:25:16] excuses and to give up and turn around
[1:25:19] and go
[1:25:20] back God knew before we entered the
[1:25:24] world this world what our challenges
[1:25:27] would
[1:25:28] be so he placed the strength in you and
[1:25:31] us to step forth and accept the
[1:25:35] challenge I'm proud of you Jesus
[1:25:41] himself he embraced the
[1:25:45] cross God built us to overcome
[1:25:50] am that's right
[1:25:52] yes

[1:26:10] Nations and even lines were about to be
[1:26:13] redrawn we were about to become all

[1:30:13] there the greatest army in the world
[1:30:17] followed them and God drowned the
[1:30:19] greatest army in the world
[1:30:21] [Applause]
[1:30:27] one of our greatest family members was a
[1:30:30] farmer and God told him to build an Bo a
[1:30:34] boat out of the worst
[1:30:38] wood out of the funniest looking boat
[1:30:40] that you could
[1:30:43] have and he kept preaching it's going to
[1:30:48] rain and science told him it couldn't
[1:30:51] happen
[1:30:53] these silly people that came against the
[1:30:55] message they should have been in Noah's
[1:30:58] day it has never
[1:31:01] rained
[1:31:03] really well see how that worked out for
[1:31:08] you it's never rained God not only
[1:31:11] opened the heavens and it rained but he
[1:31:13] opened the Billows of the
[1:31:16] earth and those that were in the ark
[1:31:19] were
[1:31:20] saved a farmer not an architect built a
[1:31:24] boat cuz God told
[1:31:27] him I want to say this you I'll follow
[1:31:30] God's
[1:31:31] instructions but our greatest
[1:31:34] champion he conquered death hell and the
[1:31:38] grave every one of those stripes at
[1:31:41] Pilot's judgment Hall when they were
[1:31:43] beating him the devil inspired those men
[1:31:46] to beat him like never before and his
[1:31:49] back opened up to his organs were pump
[1:31:51] ping out of his back but our champion
[1:31:54] didn't give up he didn't say I've had
[1:31:57] enough it was
[1:32:00] you it was you that was on the
[1:32:04] mind he did that when your children when
[1:32:08] your children are being born and doctors
[1:32:10] said they can't live and God was there
[1:32:13] as their
[1:32:16] healer we are proved to us that the
[1:32:19] weakest of Christians said go on their
[1:32:22] knees and shake the kingdom of hell I
[1:32:25] want to remind you today that we are
[1:32:34] champions want you turn to your neighbor
[1:32:36] and tell them we are
[1:32:43] champions you can only fight the fight
[1:32:46] that comes to
[1:32:50] you so many people preach against
[1:32:53] different things but they've never
[1:32:55] fought it I stand here today with brain
[1:32:58] cancer lung cancer and cancer in other
[1:33:02] places the battle was choked somewhere
[1:33:06] God allowed it to happen so I accept the
[1:33:11] challenge I accept the challenge I stand
[1:33:15] here and preach to you with faith and
[1:33:17] cons and and and
[1:33:19] courage I walk out when I don't feel
[1:33:22] like walking out and I stand to you and
[1:33:25] I do that much because I know that
[1:33:28] you're facing
[1:33:29] battles and you got to stay on your
[1:33:32] feet you got to pull your sword when it
[1:33:36] don't feel like
[1:33:38] it you got to have courage to get
[1:33:42] up and I say this you if you've fallen
[1:33:45] down and you're in your petty party I
[1:33:47] want to encourage you and be your
[1:33:48] cheerleader this morning get up yeah
[1:33:52] get
[1:33:53] up keep getting
[1:33:59] up as Muhammad Ali's cheerleader or his
[1:34:03] his his coach in the corner would tell
[1:34:06] him said I didn't have to tell him how
[1:34:08] to fight I just had to remind him of who
[1:34:11] he
[1:34:12] was I don't have to tell you how to
[1:34:17] fight I have to remind you of who you
[1:34:28] are I want to I want to just give you a
[1:34:30] few parallels here just now just in case
[1:34:32] you've thought you've had some bad
[1:34:34] days Abraham
[1:34:38] Lincoln had been defeated 12 times for
[1:34:41] public
[1:34:43] office he took the he took the platform
[1:34:46] of impossible
[1:34:50] odds and he ran for president of the
[1:34:53] United States of
[1:34:57] America his picture was all over it was
[1:35:01] the first time that they used paper to
[1:35:03] put up
[1:35:04] placards a 12year old little girl sent
[1:35:07] him a letter and said you look too
[1:35:11] immature grow a
[1:35:14] beard so you can learn things from a
[1:35:17] 12-year-old
[1:35:20] child and he grew a
[1:35:22] beard let me just say this to you we're
[1:35:25] anointed for the
[1:35:27] challenge the scripture says that his
[1:35:30] strength is made perfect in
[1:35:33] weakness his strength is made perfect in
[1:35:37] weakness brother Ron but I've got
[1:35:39] critics but it's your
[1:35:43] critics that call you the
[1:35:50] masterpiece
[1:35:52] M now think about how bad that you
[1:35:55] torment the kingdom of
[1:35:57] Hell regardless of what he throws at you
[1:36:01] you're still
[1:36:05] standing right Boo devil don't you just
[1:36:08] say that right there boo
[1:36:12] devil I've read this before and I'll
[1:36:14] read it again may all hell may all hell
[1:36:19] celebrate the Day
[1:36:22] I
[1:36:23] die cuz I will torment them no
[1:36:26] more fny Christ belied to be 95 years
[1:36:30] old she was blind she would write most
[1:36:34] of the songs that we would sing even
[1:36:36] today this is one of the statements that
[1:36:39] she made if I had a
[1:36:41] choice I would
[1:36:43] choose I would still choose to remain
[1:36:48] blind for when I die the first face that
[1:36:51] I see will be the face of my blessed
[1:36:56] savior one of the next statements became
[1:37:00] became a song Blessed
[1:37:02] assurance Jesus is
[1:37:06] mine oh what a foretaste of Glory Divine
[1:37:10] I'm an heir of Salvation I'm purchased
[1:37:14] of God washed in his Spirit cleansed by
[1:37:18] his
[1:37:20] blood many people have told me that I
[1:37:22] look like a man called
[1:37:26] Teddy Teddy Roosevelt if I had a quarter
[1:37:29] for everyone I could probably buy all of
[1:37:30] your dinner every time somebody says
[1:37:32] that I look like him well I could be
[1:37:35] look like somebody worse than
[1:37:38] that someone walked into Cracker Barrel
[1:37:41] and we were all sitting there and she
[1:37:42] said wow you look like your daddy I
[1:37:46] turned to Alden who was sitting next to
[1:37:48] me and I said well I'm glad I don't look
[1:37:50] like the mailman
[1:37:53] [Applause]
[1:38:01] Teddy's
[1:38:02] ambition he was rich he didn't have to
[1:38:06] run for public
[1:38:11] office he
[1:38:13] wanted Parks all over the United States
[1:38:17] and in many places in the other places
[1:38:19] of the
[1:38:20] world and here's what his ambition was
[1:38:23] he wanted the most beautiful places to
[1:38:25] be preserved preserved places parks to
[1:38:30] give us an image of what
[1:38:34] heaven what heaven will be
[1:38:40] like he was getting ready to make a
[1:38:43] speech you know what that speech
[1:38:46] was the man in the
[1:38:49] arena and it was a huge thousands and
[1:38:52] thousands of people were
[1:38:54] there and he felt something thump him
[1:38:57] and he realized that he was
[1:39:02] shot put his hand in his vest he always
[1:39:05] wore a three-piece suit I don't do it
[1:39:08] for
[1:39:09] Teddy but I wear a three-piece suit
[1:39:12] everywhere I
[1:39:14] go most of that is for so you can't see
[1:39:17] how fat I am or how skinny I
[1:39:20] am that's a
[1:39:23] truth but he was shot in the
[1:39:26] chest and he said I've been shot we'll
[1:39:29] tend to that a bit
[1:39:31] later one of the reasons that the shot
[1:39:34] didn't kill him was he had a he had a
[1:39:38] speech in there called The Man in the
[1:39:41] arena and the bullet went through the
[1:39:43] speech and it landed in his rib cage
[1:39:46] they'd never be able to get it out he
[1:39:48] lived with that bullet for the rest of
[1:39:50] his life
[1:39:51] and instead of saying I've been shot I'm
[1:39:53] going home he stood there and spoke for
[1:39:57] 84
[1:39:58] minutes as blood ran down and dripped on
[1:40:02] his
[1:40:03] pants let me just say this to you we've
[1:40:07] had incredible examples in front of us
[1:40:09] to never give
[1:40:12] up there was a man named Glenn
[1:40:14] Cunningham as a little
[1:40:16] boy he was burned by a hot stove in the
[1:40:19] house his the coals came out on his legs
[1:40:23] and when they got him to the hospital
[1:40:25] the doctors immediately made a made a
[1:40:28] statement your legs will never return to
[1:40:30] normal we need to we need to cut your
[1:40:34] legs off he said no I don't want you to
[1:40:37] cut my legs
[1:40:38] off uh I want you to leave them
[1:40:42] there and and literally an incredible
[1:40:45] time was spent and he would go home and
[1:40:49] not be able to walk and not be able to
[1:40:51] do anything and he would sit in a
[1:40:53] wheelchair and get himself up in a
[1:40:54] wheelchair he would roll himself out in
[1:40:57] the front yard and while he'd be in the
[1:40:59] front yard he would come to the picket
[1:41:02] fence and he would watch all the
[1:41:03] children playing going backwards and
[1:41:06] forwards and and he said I want to walk
[1:41:11] again and what he would do is he would
[1:41:13] grab that fi picket fence and he would
[1:41:16] pull himself
[1:41:18] up and he would stand there and watch
[1:41:21] those children go by and day by day by
[1:41:24] day by day in quite a long time and
[1:41:26] after a while he took his first
[1:41:29] step he got courage to take another step
[1:41:33] and got courage to take another
[1:41:35] step and before long Glenn was going all
[1:41:39] over that yard and
[1:41:43] Glenn after a while was not just walking
[1:41:46] he was running amen the long of that
[1:41:50] story was Glenn Cunningham whose legs
[1:41:54] were supposed to come off became an
[1:41:57] Olympic
[1:41:58] runner and he was the first man in the
[1:42:02] Olympics to run a 4minute
[1:42:14] mile don't tell me about
[1:42:19] excuses
[1:42:22] reach down inside of you and pull
[1:42:24] yourself
[1:42:25] up ask God for strength he can give us
[1:42:30] strength ask God for courage he can give
[1:42:33] us
[1:42:36] courage brother bcll many years
[1:42:41] ago heard about a man
[1:42:43] speaking in his area and he wanted to go
[1:42:47] see this man the courage that he had and
[1:42:49] the strength that he had
[1:42:51] this man was known as the smartest man
[1:42:54] to ever live his name was Steven
[1:42:58] Hawkins among all the scientists he
[1:43:01] proved that there was a god it made
[1:43:04] every scientist mad but he proved that
[1:43:07] there was a god quoting Hebrews chapter
[1:43:12] 1 and let me just say this chapter 11
[1:43:15] verse
[1:43:16] 1 let me just say this to you he had
[1:43:19] every excuse in the world not to do
[1:43:22] anything he was a man that had had a
[1:43:26] condition to where that it came down
[1:43:28] till he didn't have the strength to move
[1:43:30] his legs didn't have the strength to
[1:43:32] move his arms he could not talk he could
[1:43:35] not utter so he would whisper through a
[1:43:38] computer that he helped develop listen
[1:43:41] with with his scientific
[1:43:45] mind
[1:43:47] you are different people today am
[1:43:51] because of what he accomplished in his
[1:43:57] life every one of
[1:44:01] us are live in a better world because
[1:44:05] that man overcame his
[1:44:15] battle Psalms chapter 17 and verse1
[1:44:19] 15 I as for
[1:44:22] me I will Behold thy face in
[1:44:25] righteousness I shall be satisfied when
[1:44:28] I'm awake with thy
[1:44:30] likeness job CH 23 and verse 10 but he
[1:44:34] knoweth the way that I take and when he
[1:44:37] ha tried me I shall come forth as
[1:44:42] go now let me just say this you when God
[1:44:45] said let there be there was
[1:44:48] results God believed his own
[1:44:52] words and when God gives us the
[1:44:54] opportunity to to utter the words of God
[1:44:59] by his stripes we are healed that's not
[1:45:02] our words that's God's words God swore
[1:45:06] by himself when he could swear by no
[1:45:08] greater he wrote a covenant with the
[1:45:11] families of the
[1:45:12] earth he deposited himself on the inside
[1:45:17] of
[1:45:18] you I'm glad of that aren't you you
[1:45:21] that's a great big statement he
[1:45:23] deposited himself on the inside of you
[1:45:28] when nobody else thinks you're important
[1:45:30] God said you
[1:45:33] were when he said let there be a sun and
[1:45:35] let there be moons and let there be
[1:45:37] Stars those stars are reflection in the
[1:45:41] darkest of Night of the light of the
