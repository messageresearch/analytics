bless you maybe I'll get to shake your hand after service and so thank you so thank you for being here we've got a few things to do before preaching this morning we have a baby dedication and it's always a great thing for us and Little Miss Everly Grace came into the world and where church is growing brother Brandon and sister Catherine die that's blessed that God has blessed their family she's eight pounds and three ounces and so man she's already a pound bigger than I was when I was born so any others any other people that was born on March the 8th March the 8th so she's got her own birthday that's a nice thing I was reading over some of the characteristics of the March 8th baby and I found them kind of interesting they're original nobody's quite like them they enjoy spending time surrounded by people who are talented as themselves they also take time to observe what is going on around them and in their human personality and nature of activity they cannot be more annoyed by people with small minds I must have been born on this day they enjoy artsy Enterprises and show their potential that they can be quite charitable as well they're optimistic they're accepting they're generous they're people who are set to change the world although when young they might seem adventurous and quickly distracted and eventually they will gain eventually they will gain more insight and put their mark on the world I find sometimes by reading those things that if you read yours in what hour that you're born it kind of tells your life story in Deuteronomy chapter 6 it said hero Israel the Lord our God is one Lord and thou shalt love the Lord with all thine heart and with all thy soul and with all thy might and these words which I command thee this day shall be in thine heart and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children and shall talk to them when thou sittest in thine house and when thy walkest in thy way and when thy lie us down and when they riseth up and thou shall bind them for a sign and unto thy hand and they shall be frontlets between their eyes two people begin to date begin to love one another a married a man marries a wife and then we sin begin to see what the character that's on the inside of him they become a joint unit and then two become one and then two becomes three now that baby is an extension of their lives they take on responsibilities now life is more than about themselves they're not the boss of their home they tell you when to get up they tell you when you need to eat they tell you what they like and what they don't like and they're their own little person but they're also a part of God Amen brother Brandon sister Catherine your family all of you would like to come amen Jesus took time to dedicate babies

begins to grow she begins to recognize the presence of the Lord now father there's a lot of harm in this evil world but we realize there's an angel that has been dispatched to watch over her keep her

ready to have an operation tomorrow amen he's going to be laid up for weeks it's going to have his we've been picking on him about that so that's the reason I said it we haven't decided whether we're going to have a meal plan for him or not amen he's going to have surgery on his knee and make sure they work on the the right one Zoe has come she's going to have a surgery they're going to take her adenoids out her tonsils out and they're going to put uh tubes in her ears yeah and that's going to take place Tuesday on Wednesday I'm going to have all the scans done so I'll lay my hand on my own

and he's going to be in ICU until they can find a heart and do a heart transplant for him brother Marcus his son and so and so we just pray that he gets the right heart because their heart he'll actually take on somebody else's nature with that heart and amen so and then sister Edwards you have a situation with your knee I think and so if you boys could help her come down amen can you do that sister Edwards yeah well we didn't do this at our former Church well you're not at your former church and so I'm amen amen God bless you [Music] amen God bless you Sister Edwards I am amen we're so glad to have you with us too amen so glad to have you with us amen we want to pray Heavenly Father you see the needs that are before us even now brother Matthew as he goes to have his knee cleaned out and for it to do better I ask you that you would guide the doctor that will be taken care of that father we thank you that there are doctors that can help us and Lord I just ask you that you would just heal it because a doctor can heal he just does his work but God you're the Healer and so we ask you that you would touch him watch over him in the coming days for a recovery Lord for our precious babies Zoe named after God's own life and my mother is well Christine Lord I pray as they take these adenoids and her tonsils out and and and put the tubes in her ears Lord we we're asking that you would help her to be able to talk and Lord May these operations help her to be able to do that we're believing in a God that hears and understands Lord she's been dedicated to you and now we ask you that you would heal her body even now father Lord may you just stretch forth your hand of Mercy in a special way brother Marcus's son is in the hospital just had a heart pump put in candidate for a for a for a new heart now father we have placed him into your hands and it was like Daniel had to wait on God now Lord Jesus we ask you that you would help them help the doctors to help him Lord help the family that will become the donor of a heart but Lord Jesus May that heart live in his life and may it take Lord May there be no complications dear God I pray that you would extend his life and and heal him dear God today you're the Healer of broken hearts sister Edward stands here with a with problems with her legs now father we ask you that you would heal her today Lord we pray that you would just minister to her in a special way Lord the needs that are all over this building now we raise our hands to you myself as well I pray that you would come and touch our bodies and bring us strength I need strength today I pray that you would just help us father Lord in the name of Jesus Christ we pray and we thank you that you hear our prayers in Jesus name amen and amen amen God bless you Sister Edwards amen God bless you God bless you amen Give the Lord a good hand isn't God good amen I believe there's a testimony of service that's going to take place at the youth meeting this evening amen if you'd like to I'm personally I'm going to try my best to be there to hear those testimonies that took place there every person has their own testimony of what they saw what they felt if you didn't feel anything you still knew he was there and so God gave us strength to be able to be a part of that meeting and it took me the week to try to get over it and we're praying this morning I woke up and felt like all the strength of my body had just left and so we're here we're here and so amen sister Katie has a saying for me and I try to walk two miles every morning on the treadmill and she says you're lapping everybody's sitting on a couch Brother David spoke last night and you know sometimes I don't think that we realize what's going on sometimes we don't capture it sometimes we miss the moment when it's happening but brother branham's vision of the Bride around the world Brother David played a part of that last night coming from Belgium his grandfather 52 years ago stood at brother fulchers and I as a little boy about 10 years old stood and listened to him preach and I still remember him and here we are 52 years later and the sermon that you heard last night he didn't tell you but God spoke to him that he would be preaching that sermon months ago when these Arrangements wasn't made that he'd be standing here preaching in that service and so that didn't come from the mind of a man that came from God and your long-awaited question the answers on the way and so as I sat and thought about all the long-awaited questions that we thought will it ever happen will it ever take place will we ever get an answer to it it's on the way it's on the way and God sent his servant here a pastor a man that's been through great difficulties and uh great trials and he's still standing sometimes we only get a glimpse of a man's life when he stands and preaches to us an hour and we only get a glimpse of his life but what you're seeing is a victory of many years many trials many dark paths and he's still standing it could have been an easier way he could have stayed on a public job and could have done a lot of things and could have been quite successful in life but he chose the Narrow Path and so we thank you we thank you for Brother David coming and being a part of that service last night and and we love him with all of our hearts and you carry our love home he's a general he's a general and I how I know he's a general I sat at a table with him one morning early and the Lord spoke into my ears and regardless of what you thought about yourself God spoke to me many years ago and said this is one of my generals amen Give the Lord a good hand Hallelujah now they have interpreted many sermons of brother branham's and uh he actually carried the stick that had 400 and some messages on it and got it on the Hub at musk at much risk and it much pressure against him to do it but he made sure that the Dutch people could hear the message in their own language and how important is that how important is that all right so I'm going to give you a little example here of Brother David speaking in Dutch and so if you'll come and you'll interpret for me and so what what happens is this I speak in English and then he speaks in Dutch and then I'm going to speak in Dutch okay so he says what I say and so yeah I'm a general from Belgium I come because I love you and I mean it with all my heart and and brother Ron is going to come and preach for us soon [Applause] I didn't tell him what I was going to say and God bless you Brother David I so love you with all my heart amen what a day what a day that will be I'm honored that you would come deeply honored if you could stand with me this morning I hope you have time to listen to me preach for a little while I've been working on this for a bit but it's about you overcoming in the night season I know you're against a you're up against a lot of things and you're you're in the midst of a lot of trouble but God called you to overcome in darkness brother Branham couldn't see past 1977. and God held it that way and if you remember in the church ages and the seals he draws in a little light because it was total darkness and God allowed him to draw in a little bit of light and that was you and we realize that we're pressing against the darkness and brother Branham says that it is the darkest just before the dawn it's cause the darkness is congelling together it's gathering together brother Branham makes statements he said especially during the prayer line he said Spirits would call out all over the building he said there'd be dark lines running all over the building those cancer Devils or those epileptic devils are screaming for help and so they'll start put pulling together one to another trying to get strength to not have to leave but God's greater God's greater than all the darkness that you're fighting and just to kind of give you a little background those those 12 Spies that went into the land ten of them came back with an evil report it's too dark for us it's too bad for us to go over there but two came back two come back and they begin to try to steal the people because Caleb was a had a different Spirit on him and he's still the people sure there were giants sure there was a lot of obstacles in the way he said but we're more than able we're more than able it's our promise we will have a resurrection there will be a bride there will be a body change right in the midst of all of this Darkness amen amen Psalms chapter 27 and verse 1. amen let's just talk to him for a moment Lord Jesus I feel your presence here at this this stage just now oh what a powerful presence now I ask you that it would go all over this audience that every person man woman boy and girl would feel this and give us strength and encourage us encourage forgive us of our sins and our mistakes our humanities are thinking Lord we're so small-minded in our thinking sometimes but help the spirit of God to lift our faith and our courage like never before if we set a word out of place if we've had an attitude out of place forgive us father there let us kiss your feet today let us worship you as the word Goes Forth anoint the word anoint our hearts anoint our minds anoint this people we ask you in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid when the wicked even mine enemies and my foes Came Upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell though a host shouldn't Camp against me my heart shall not fear though War should rise against me in this will I be confident one thing that I have desired of the Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple read this next scripture with me for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion and in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me and he shall set me upon a rock you may be seated Isaiah 53 and verse 5. but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquity brother Branham said if you'd have been the only one lost he would have came quite a statement isn't it the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed Revelations chapter 3 the darkest age of all the seven Church ages it's an age to which that Jesus was put on the outside of the church and the church has become Ichabod the spirit of the Lord is departed from it we can especially see it today he's not welcome in their Church the word is not welcome our governments he's not welcome in our governments anymore but there's going to be a people in this Dark Age that hear the message of the hour to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne Revelations 3 21. to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and I'm sat down with my father in Hip throne I want you to read that with me again to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and was set down with my father in his throne we realized that the message has already been delivered and there's nothing the devil can do to stop it you are the living physical attributes of God that baby that we just dedicated just a few moments ago it was once a thought and then it began to materialize in a womb but now it's made manifest it is the physical thoughts that God had before the foundation of the world it would be like the Lamb's Book of Life that name was written there and now it's displayed Satan's tried to stop it so many times because of the potential that that baby has as an overcomer especially a little girl grow up and dress right and live right and act right and has a character of Jesus Christ Living in spite in spite of all the devil tries to stop brother Branham called you not brother Branham but God behind it called you the final voice to the final age called you an invincible Army he called you ambassadors representative for the king you're not just a church but you're the Bride of Jesus Christ in Geneva Switzerland there's great people that are powerful that gather together from all over the world they're some of the most powerful people but let me just say this to you they have nothing on the Bride of Jesus Christ you're the most powerful people that there is as it was said last night on on in the book of Acts chapter 3 the devil was all relaxed in his bed brother Branham would even say he was relaxed in his bread thousands received the Holy Ghost but when those disciples went by a man that was lame and they said Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have give I Thee in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk it was now more if I can say it this way now it's more than books and tapes and pictures on a wall now it's overcoming vessels taking the message and letting it live as long as this message stays in book form the devil don't have much problem [Applause] as long as it stays in tape form the devil don't have no problem but listen when you start overcoming and then he knows the Rapture is already on the way not just someday but it's already in process you've been lifted from denomination you've been lifted from sin you've been lifted you're risen again in Jesus Christ and God begins to show the dependentials that are on the gene seed in your life and regardless of all the darkness around you you're illuminated by the word of God and Satanist did everything that he can to stop you [Music] that's right sure we're in a fight but we're going to win [Applause] every one of you will fight different circumstances of your life but if you can read the back of the book we're going to win you may have come this morning and you may be going through the deepest darkest Trials of your life but you're going to win I got some really good news for you you're gonna win now you're gonna have to fight every day when will the fight be over seconds before the rapture but you're not going to fight by Who You Are and you're not going to fight by your physical abilities or any of your talents you're going to overcome by the blood of the Lamb and the word of your testimony you heard the minister say last night that you have the power to bind Satan but you also have the power to loose him how do you loosen by the word of your testimony if it becomes negative so never allow negativity to go through you brother Branham had some and I find this to be an interesting quote he says what a glorious thing that it is for his church after 1900 years almost 2 000 years to know that that he lives we meet him on every Bend of the road and at every turn and every place that we we go we see Jesus we his we see him living the presence flowing like a radiant light from his glorious Church of the Living God how thankful we ought to be for that the message was given at the tomb come see go tell the first thing come and be convinced nowadays people don't want to come and see those who do come can't set 10 minutes five minutes sometimes and if you cross their path they're gone come see don't just peep in stand and look it over come and see and then go tell it that's what that was what he told the women that morning at the grave come and see where he was laid but he's not here no more then go tell his disciples that I'll meet you over in Galilee go tell who his bewildered disciples they were certainly bewildered they didn't know what to do many of them had returned back to their fish nets they wanted to go back to catching fish they were bewildered because they didn't know they didn't know what or how to make ends meet they had absolutely trusted he was the Messiah and here he was dead and they didn't know what to do now but he told them go tell this bewildered Church that I am alive I'll go before them I'll meet them in Galilee as I promise to do the church bewildered them it's no worse than the church today it's still bewildered it can't make out the Scriptures it cannot understand why that Mark 16 was written in the Bible they were so bewildered they even say it's not inspired and they find other scriptures the Holy Spirit was applied for maybe another day but not this day they find other scriptures that says the days of Miracles are done and they claim that there's no Miracles that was only in the past you talk about being bewildered I'm preaching now I'm preaching now they're more than bewildered now than they were then it's the darkness it's the unbelief it's the death cycle that's set into the church don't let it come into the message but something like they was because the only thing that those disciples had to comfort them was a past experience and the church today is a great deal that that way even Pentecostals trying to satisfy themselves with Acts 2 some past experience but oh that message of a living God he still lives today why are you so bewildered I go before you I'm Not Dead but I'm alive quite a statement isn't it brother Brandon says this he said he said I'm a likening God so that you won't be mixed up and what I've said today God is a great diamond the eternal and when a diamond is brought out of the blue stones of Africa I've been in the mines and watched them in the great how they process and get the diamonds out he says now they go through the crusher and the great blue Fire diamonds black diamonds come out they have so much not much form a certain form and they're they're just a great Stone and really they have no fire in them at the time they're just a diamond a stone round smoothed out a lot of them but the diamond has to be cut out it's against the law to have one of them without being cut now which he said it must be cut then you have to have a receipt where you bought it because there is millions of dollars in them I liken God to the great diamond he said now diamond is cut so that it will reflect what's on the inside of it the fire that's in the diamond it has to be cut in every little way every little shape three points put the three points to a diamond and the light it gets the three-point object will give forth seven different colors and make seven different colors he said now notice this he said God was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquity he was cut he was bruised the great Diamond that from him might reflect the gifts of God no matter how big the diamond or how small the diamond it's still diamond we sometimes looked at the ring on a fender and if you've got quite a bit of money you buy a million dollar ring if you got no money you go to the second hand store and you don't tell her or maybe you borrow your mother's diamond or your grandmother's Diamond don't laugh at that it's a real special thing it's a real special thing and that diamond reflects that how much that you love her you know no matter once you get that diamond you kind of Hold Your Hand a certain way you know you want everybody to see you now it's the Bride of Jesus Christ Our diamond was slipped on us before the foundation of the world for a lot for a long time you look like a Round Rock you had a lot of dirt on you come on I'm talking about you now did you guys just get here you just walked in yeah just now sister Betty can you show this church your diamond oh yeah [Applause] well a little birdie told me you were coming now I couldn't get to your wedding yesterday but you wanted me to pray for you at that wedding and you've traveled and you're on

went through some real dark times cancer is a real bad bear it's your experiencing something now that there's a diamond in the Darkness in the darkness you had to have some darkness in your life to come to this moment and you may have wondered why both of you had to go through all of that but you couldn't be here with all of that that's right I want to instruct you love her like never before love him like never before and I couldn't be more proud of what's Happening I'm so happy I'm glad you finally made up your mind you ask her a million times and finally that one time she got weak yeah just for a moment what happened what happens in dog days that go blind and they go silly but she will wake up just be aware she will wake I find it interesting that you wanted me to pray over your your marriage and here you are and you didn't know that I would do this but I want to do it now God bless you brother Luther sister Betty I love you may you enjoy many days of Happiness many days of great joy don't waste a day don't you dare waste a day no I know you want the love of my life yeah I know yeah it's in your eyes yeah yeah it's in your eyes I'm a 16 year old yeah [Laughter] that's

Lord Jesus these are my friends for many years and they married yesterday you bless their marriage you bless them now Lord Jesus they've had a lot of hardship in their life and there may be even hardship in the future it's for better for worse but there's nothing like love I pray that you'd bless their home bless their time bless their families the extended families bless the church and Lord

in all of that dark trouble you thought I could never be happy again I'm going to read your spirit now you thought this is the end of my life and you thought the joy of my life is gone it's gone forever but God saw your future and God rewrote your book enjoy it enjoy it I'm not going anywhere sister Connie if we think about the behind the scenes of the message brother Branham had great difficulty many places that he preached and he would be preaching a masterpiece and sitting behind him was 300 critical preachers when brother Branham was here he set he said in president's uh Halls he said he said in great great leaders he talked about JFK and his wife when brother Branham was illuminated standing and illuminated the Bride of Jesus Christ the background was a political world that was falling apart John F Kennedy Bay of Pigs the second world war had just been over the Depression had just happened only only a decade or so before that before the opening of the seals The Liberation of women's rights was taking place racial movements was taking place three kings was on the scene at the same time one was Elvis Presley and it was open up the rock and roll World literally hell was enlarged in itself and the only reason it could do that is be because the anti-type of that was Heaven was opening itself up and God was showing all the Mysteries time would be no longer where the Mysteries would be held up so hell now is loosed on the earth against the Bride of Jesus Christ Martin Luther King would have a message and he would begin to he would begin to make a movement and then Marcus had uh acts would would come on this scene and and literally cause a hatred amongst amongst the people all Roberts would begin to preach and his candle would get lit through the prophet Billy Graham who would stand and be the pastor to presidents and he would stand and give try to keep God he would he would try to keep God amongst our government but our government didn't want God if you go back to some of Billy Graham's original sermons when the angel of God was on the earth with brother Branham Billy Graham was in joy in that overflow of the Angel's presence are you with me and they would sing just as I am I come to thee and the spirit of God would flow down across those audiences and tens of thousands were to walk to an altar to make a change in their life are you with me but they didn't realize that Billy Graham's Ministry could only take them so far and he would actually complain I I go and thirty thousand is delivered next year I can't find 30. brother man say it's because they didn't have the Holy Ghost he wasn't taking them far enough let me just say this year never come to a spot to where you get satisfied you stay hungry you stay wanting more of God [Applause] Sodom conditions was on the scene it was letting loose both sides I'm don't get political both sides Republican and Democrat is embracing transgender foreign but now they're embracing they'd sell their soul to get their mother's vote we live in a rotten world it's a Sodom world to where that even in Washington state they allow even little children to make their own choice and they can take their children out of homes so that they can make the transition what a world we live in it's lost its identification Abraham lived in that kind of a world we see Abraham the great Overcomer the father of Faith but the background of that he only lived a few miles from Sodom his own nephew split the church walked away and he pitched his tent towards Sodom never thinking he'd become the male never thinking he'd leave the altar of Abraham never thinking that I'll go this far he never thought that it would come to a time in his life that he would offer his virgin daughters all right sometimes when you walk away from a message and you think oh I'll hold on no you won't [Applause] I want to say no you want I'm not going to I'm going to quit church and I'm going to I'm going to be as good a Christian next week well you might be next week but I've said it many times five years from today five years from today look and look back your family was together your children was not music in your home wine in your home alcohol in your home marriage is falling apart you can't hold yourself I'm just going to say it how it is you have jumped off of the cliff you've jumped off of the cliff and there's nothing to hold you I can hold myself I told a young man one time I said you know the first devil that walks in you might be able to control him but you don't realize that the scripture said that he holds the door open for seven more Devils worse than himself and those demons listen Satan is not a good negotiator young people let me just say church is the most Lively part of your life and when they offer you drugs it'll destroy you when they offer you alcohol it'll destroy you pornography enters into your life you're lusting after somebody else's wife somebody else's husband and to be very honest with you 10 years from now she won't look like that [Music] and you've sold your soul for a pot of gold and it turns out to be black belly LED worthless Satan don't mind you winding up in prison and destroyed as a matter of fact he don't mind you coming to church sitting and going well I'm wasting my time here he needed a right well that preacher he needs to quit don't he know we've got a busy life who are you here being influenced by [Applause] this is going to change your body one day CNN and Fox News and sports is not going to change your body this Christ is going to change your body brother on I'm too busy to go to church when you're in a tribulation period the choices will be easier but just think about this Oh Brother on if I have to go through the tribulation period I will you can't overcome now you can't overcome now you can't get yourself out of your lazy bag and get the strength to you to get a decent outfit on and come to church and sit for an hour or two do you really think that you're going to overcome in a tribulation period you better get right with God now [Applause] the testimony of the sea brother Branham speaks on he speaks also be not afraid brother Brian said they Jesus told him said I'll meet you on the other side we'll go to the other side they pushes their their muscles shoulders against that boat pushes it out into the water they don't know what lays ahead of them Jesus gets he's wore out he's tired and he goes to a special place in that boat maybe it's Nets maybe it's some sort of a blanket he pulls it up over himself Jesus goes to sleep we'll go two different ways here because two different occurrences happen they start having a testimony meeting one pops up and he begins to tell about what Jesus did for him the Miracles that he seen what he's been a part of brother bear said Peter couldn't wait for Andrew to quit he finally stood up and he he wanted Andrew to stop because Andrew was enjoying talking about what God had done for him and Peter wanted to talk for a little while and then Nathaniel wanted to talk listen I didn't I didn't know that that was him but he told me that he saw me while I was still under the tree an Israelite in whom there's no God he knowed me he knowed me I didn't know where I was at at the time but he knowed me my daddy told me that this kind of Messiah was on the way he told me that he was on the way and when I met him I knew that's him [Music] [Applause] they didn't know a storm was coming sometimes you don't know a storm's coming Satan gets in your storms he gets in your moodiness he gets in the trials of your life he blows things up Spirit of God's been in your home and all of a sudden you feel a chill overcoming is recognizing the devil at his tricks and say not today not today there you are living this message where you live in all of the chaos that is going on around us and Jesus is in your home he's in your boat and then a storm comes the backdrop of their testimony service the backdrop of all of that is a storm is headed the way God knew you before the storm came he knew you before the storms of your life come brother brother Ron but in the Bible they you know they were such Heroes of Faith did you not see the storm in their life Shadrach Meshach and Abednego Daniel waiting for 21 days for God to show up Daniel in a lion's den Daniel a leader amongst leaders in the midst of Darkness every demon in the house trying to destroy him Esther Rahab the Harlot she was as much predestinated seed as a harlot God knew where she was at you may be a drunk today you may be a prostitute today you may be a dope addict today but God's pulling on your heart don't take that for granted don't take it for granted when God pulls on your heart move move quickly don't take a service for granted move quickly last night we sat at the table and Brother David tells us a testimony about demons coming into his room after a after a prayer line coming into his room pinning him down filling the hair of those demons scratching against his body couldn't move couldn't talk couldn't even move his mouth he said I just started to think the name of Jesus Christ think the name of Jesus Christ think the name of Jesus Christ he would destroy us if he could he would destroy us a sick and with thinking the name of Jesus Christ those demons begin to break and what he couldn't even move a muscle couldn't move his mouth couldn't even roll his eyes those demons had to give up at the name of Jesus Christ this morning Gabriel and Malachi said at my said I had an experience this week and he said I was in the bed and I was laying on my belly had my head down and he said God began to move in the room he said I couldn't move a muscle I could feel him all over me I thought the Rapture was getting ready to happen I literally was looking to see if Sarah was still in the bed we're getting ready to take a Rapture I want you to think about this same table hours apart work for work the devil trying to destroy and then God's saying rapture's on the scene [Applause] same table hours apart almost the same words Satan's against us but God's on our side Satan's trying to destroy us but we're preparing for a rapture living in the same atmosphere in the hour of Darkness God's got this God's got this [Applause] Jesus knew on the other side we were in Louisiana last week Saturday night about 1 30 we went to bed four o'clock in the morning we had cast out demons one demon that came out had a headable head of a wolf and had eyes about that big and it came out he said brother on these things ain't real that girl had been molested at eight years old and it left a demon but in that prayer line that demon was exposed five listen you better be right as a preacher of God you better be right when you're looking back in the history of somebody you're going to say when you was a child and tell them what exactly takes place and then that demon knows you've got more power than he's got he knows when it comes Rapture mourning he can't hold you he's fought you all these years but he can't hold you thank you and I woke up and those demons were in the room that same wolf with those same eyes and it was like a a gang of teenage boys dressed up and those demons were running running all over my room and I woke up and I could feel them brushing my body now you better know who you are when that's going on I woke up and I said in the name of Jesus Christ leave now go to the river jump in the river I gave them Specific Instructions I didn't want them to go to another person I didn't want them just roaming throughout the campground you go to the river who do you think you are brother Ron the same Jesus [Applause] the same Jesus lives inside of us I give you instructions if you're sitting with a dead preacher that don't have the power to cast out the devil in this Dark Age you better be finding a church where there's a living God to keep the devil off of your home keep the devil out come on Church brother on God don't do that no more you're too late you're too late to tell me that God's still in the business he still cast out Devils he still fills people with the Holy Ghost there's overcoming bride of Jesus Christ brother Ron but you guys are just too emotional brother Brown said if your religion hadn't got a murder emotion in It Go bury it because it's dead we were staying in a 42 inch travel home 42. that'd be that'd be kind of 42 foot that's why you're here to help me he's on the opposite end the doors are closed and he can hear everything that's going on and he hears me praying God give me strength God restore the strength of my body God restore the strength of my body God restore the strength of my body I'm not looking for a specific pill to restore the strength of my body cancer is trying to destroy this body chemo's trying to destroy this body but God I prayed to him this morning and I said God you know I don't have the strength I have to be honest I don't have the strength to preach but God you're the god that can give me strength in my body [Applause] Jesus met the devil one time up on a mountain and it was at the weakest point of Jesus's life a man brother Shannon he had fasted for 40 days and 49th and it was it at his weakest he couldn't feel anointed knowing who he was but he couldn't feel the angels and the devil came to him and when the devil came to him he offered him he offered him to be a king without Calvary because if he can get him to take king without Calvary you're lost and he offered him the kingdoms of the world even showed him the United States but why would you want a temporary Kingdom when your promise is an eternal Kingdom now that test wasn't just for Jesus but brother Branham had some tests do you think it was an easy thing to turn down a million dollars huge Cathedral brother biscoll said I saw the check that they offered him a million dollars in the 60s was phenomenal the professional athlete was making around sixty thousand dollars a year the greatest professionals was making sixty thousand dollars a year they're offering brother Branham a million but there was chaos behind it Satan will make an offer to you because you are who you are he'll make you an offer and you have to make a choice with that offer you have to make a choice with that offer I choose Jesus now 10 years from now I make a choice I choose Jesus I choose this message I'm not ashamed of this message sister Kirsten when I watch your husband get a greater portion of the Holy Ghost as he went through that prayer line and I wrapped my arms around your midsection and you were getting it it was pouring down on top of you that's my portion I'll take it when I saw you young people I know you've got to fight a lot of Darkness but when I saw you getting your portion I know every devil in hell is trying to destroy you but when I see you getting your portion eternity [Applause] brother brannerman said the man was getting ready to get his Deliverance get his healing and a demon walked up the aisle and told him that he needed to go to the bathroom and he walked out I went to the bathroom and missed his healing there's nothing that a restaurant's got there's nothing that a job has got there's nothing on your television has got that will exchange with this [Applause] you're going to be made offers you're one of the best singers I know and maybe you you would say well brother Ron I don't get paid to do it really so Elvis Presley would like to change places with you Stephen he would like to just get a moment set where you're sitting William how important are you A.A Allen who was a drunk preacher that could never overcome but yet he could use a gift would like to step from where he's at to have your seat what about you there's millions and billionaires in hell I'd like for your sister to listen to this sermon I want her to listen to this sermon because there's nothing Satan's got to offer nothing nothing Satan's got to offer then it's greater than this thank you for your burden for your sister because it's a type of Christ that lives on the inside of you it's because you've got the real thing is your concern for her but she's wrapped in the chaos of darkness in the wounds of yesterday those wounds mean nothing when the presence of Jesus comes I don't care what horrible things that you've been through if you can get in the presence of Jesus Christ five minutes years of scars will mean nothing [Applause] summer you're one one in your family and maybe there's times that you think how did I get here your journey Jeremy testifies of predestination like I've never oh I feel the Lord that girl set him beside of you she had to put up with me as a father figure and I would tell her that one's not for you that one's not for you that was not for you and she had to trust me you were coming and you with your wrinkle shirt you walked in and sat down in this church and God spoke to me that's the right one you look like a round rock with a lot of dirt on it but God knew there was a diamond laying on the inside of them [Applause] not just anybody can cut a diamond not anybody just with a chisel can cut a diamond it takes a master it takes an absolute master because you can destroy it but a master starts cutting and there may be millions of diamonds in that same Rock but there would be called a mother diamond that holds the fire and every one of those diamonds will look like the original no matter how big and no matter how small even to be a chip as small as can go on a saw or as brother Branham said a Victoria a victrola into the needle because that diamond it may be so small you can't see it but if you could look deep it's got the same fire that the original one had and listen it takes that kind of diamond when it's dropped down on that whoo when it drops down that recording it takes that diamond that's got that fire in it to make the music clear God's Diamond dropped down on the inside of you and it pulled you through the seals and it pulled you through the church ages and it pulled you through Mighty God unveiled and it pulled you through on the wings of a snow white dove and it pulled you through a living Ministry you couldn't see it God had plans Jeremy you may never see it in your own life somebody greater than me in the rain isn't that so rain your daddy died as a child and it was hard being raised with our father and you had to put up with me but I loved you so much I tell you no I was receiving instructions from a higher authority I know I need to be quitting but can you hold on just a couple more minutes when God spoke to me and he said I'm going to use you like never before I have to be honest with you I saw about every miracle that you can see including Terry after Terry saw everything that he saw in that back room his words were I can serve a God Like That he had set in church all those years but he didn't realize Darkness was coming only a month from now cancer was coming its way and so God was so rich in Mercy he had said in church all those years and he was standing at the right place at the right time because he was carrying a diamond when he told me I'll use you like never before I never thought in my wildest dreams I thought maybe more gifted maybe more wisdom to preach the deeper things of God I never thought that the demon of cancer one of the most powerful demons in hell one that was that would try to withstand the prophet in a cave that he would talk about not even cancer you see I was getting ready to be presented another backdrop I couldn't see the storm coming but I want to tell you I trusted him and there has been moments that we've tried to hide from you that are very dark and are very horrible but you know what it's dead it's made me a better person as a matter of fact it was God's Divine will to get me closer to him sickness brother Ron some of your trials will be a lot of different things but I can stand here and be honest with you it didn't drive me away from God I'm preaching to you now it didn't drive me away from God it drove me to him like never before I want to tell you a couple Secrets here it will your trial will make you know what's really important I don't know if you caught that I don't need nobody to feel sorry for me I'm not going to stand and whine to you I hope I've never come across to you as a whiner I hope I've come across to you as an armed Soldier with a sword in my hand foreign when you go get a test and they're thinking bad stuff you know what goes through your mind and it turns out to be nothing and you go thank you Jesus thank you Jesus maybe they find a spot you know what goes through your mind you think the worst thing thank God generally it's nothing but when it really is something and it's on your brain and it's in your lungs and it's on your organs and it's all over your body and you live with a sword over your head it's only the backdrop can I use myself here just for a moment expose myself it's only 10 evil reports but I'm going to be one like Caleb I'm going to be one like Paul I'm going to be one like our prophet [Applause] brother Ron what did you get out of last night's service I'm going to take cancer and whip the devil with it I'm gonna take Goliath's own sword pull it out of his sheath and I'm gonna take that cancer devil [Applause] on that great Judgment Day when demons have to be judged with God come here Ron Spencer come here Ron come down out of the balcony come down here on I need you to just stand here before these cancer devils did cancer defeat you I'm gonna say no sir by the blood of the lamb and by his stripes I was healed I may have

the Satan's Whispers behind you only causes you to bless it now just suppose you'd been Barren for a long time and every prayer was about I'm going I want a baby I want a baby I want a baby who day after day those things darken up because it gets darker the reason it gets darker is because you're glistening against it and you don't you don't quit and finally Sarah can't have a baby she knows I
