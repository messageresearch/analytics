[19:53] everyone. Lord, want to pray for our
[19:55] pastor, Brother Ron Spencer, that God
[19:57] would just touch his body and strengthen
[20:00] him. They had a wonderful service last
[20:02] night there, Brother Waynees. I pray for
[20:04] good services there this morning.
[20:07] I want to pray for Sister Teresa
[20:09] Delaney. She will be having surgery
[20:12] uh June the 9th at UVA. That God would
[20:15] just be with her there on that. As well
[20:17] as I want to remember brother Marcus
[20:19] Turner. His 2-year-old grandson has an
[20:22] enlarged lymph node in the stomach,
[20:25] possibly a second one. They believe it
[20:28] is benign. He is scheduled June the 18th
[20:31] for consult with a pediatric surgeon.
[20:34] also remember he has uh injured his
[20:37] foot. So we want to remember our brother
[20:39] Marcus that God would just touch him and
[20:41] his body. I want to continue to lift up
[20:43] our sister Wanda Hinkle that God would
[20:45] just touch her, heal her of that ovarian
[20:48] cancer and God would just move in a
[20:50] supernatural way this morning there.
[20:52] Please remember Sister Teresa Gooden and
[20:55] Sister Sarah Gooden in prayer. They need
[20:58] a touch in body. Thank you, Sister
[21:00] Darlene.

[21:28] full recovery. Thank you, brother
[21:30] Randall Griff. Amen. How many would have
[21:32] an unspoken
[21:35] request? Just pray the Lord would just
[21:37] move by each and every one of these
[21:39] needs. Just reach out and touch him this
[21:41] morning as he passes by. I'm going to
[21:43] ask brother William just come pray over
[21:46] these needs for us this
[21:50] morning. Amen. Let's bow our heads in
[21:53] our heart. Dear gracious heavenly
[21:55] father, Lord, we bow humbly before you
[21:57] in prayer. Lord, we just want to express
[22:00] how much we love you, Lord, and how much
[22:02] how much thankfulness we have in our
[22:04] hearts, Lord, for all that you do for
[22:06] us, Lord, as we think, oh God, and of
[22:10] how great that you are. And Lord, when
[22:13] you were here at the last supper, Lord,
[22:15] and the disciples were all around you,
[22:18] Lord, there was a special disciple,
[22:19] Lord, that John that he was laying on
[22:21] your
[22:22] chest. And Lord, he represented the
[22:25] bride, this specifically this end time
[22:28] bride. Lord, I believe with all my heart
[22:30] that this end time bride is a very
[22:33] special lady to
[22:34] you. And Lord, many times, many times we
[22:38] go through things in life,
[22:40] Lord, Satan, we like to drown out your
[22:42] voice and we just seem like we can't
[22:44] hear. But Lord, if we could just hear
[22:46] your heartbeat as it were, then we know
[22:49] that your presence has never left us
[22:52] because you promise that you would never
[22:53] leave us nor forsake us. Lord, I love
[22:57] you this morning for the promise. Thank
[22:59] you, Lord, that you're such a great
[23:00] comforter, Lord, that you're our healer.
[23:03] Lord, when you were on the cross, Lord,
[23:04] you said it is finished. Lord, they
[23:07] looked at s looked like to the natural
[23:08] eye that there was such a defeat and how
[23:10] could there be victory and such a
[23:12] gruesome and painful
[23:14] death. But oh God, it was Satan's
[23:17] greatest blow when you made it to the
[23:19] cross and you sh you gave your life and
[23:21] you shed your blood. Lord, the answer to
[23:24] every request, the answer to every hand
[23:27] that was uplifted, the answer to every
[23:29] sickness and every turmoil of
[23:31] life was finished. Lord, you're the
[23:35] answer to every situation. Lord, you're
[23:36] the answer to every request. Lord, we
[23:39] lift up every request to you, Lord, in
[23:40] the life behind the hand. And Lord, the
[23:43] pain, Father, and the the unspoken
[23:45] moments, oh God, of of pain and
[23:47] affliction, Lord, we just commit it into
[23:49] your hands, Lord. We know that your ways
[23:51] are so much greater than
[23:53] ours. There's many things we don't
[23:55] understand in life. But, Father, we
[23:57] trust you. We trust you with all of our
[24:00] hearts. We trust you with our mind, with
[24:02] our bodies, and with our souls. We speak
[24:05] peace to your people, Lord. As the word
[24:07] comes forth, we ask that you bless
[24:08] Brother Aaron, Lord. May he just yield
[24:11] to the gift that you place into his
[24:12] life. May life, oh Lord God, just flow
[24:15] through the words, Lord God, that he
[24:16] speaks this morning. Not the words of a
[24:19] man, but the words of God. We look to
[24:21] you now for this service, Lord, and we
[24:23] just give you all the praise, honor, and
[24:24] glory and pray that you have your way.
[24:26] Bless your people, Father. We ask in
[24:28] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[24:34] Maybe this time we'll sing uh Our God is
[24:36] tremendous. We receive this morning's
[24:39] offering. Have Sister Aaliyah come sing
[24:42] for us this morning if she would. And
[24:44] after her, we'll have Sister Whitney
[24:46] Breeden come sing. Oh, when you're in
[24:49] need, I call on the
[24:52] Lord and he hears me. Yes, he helps me.
[24:57] He is faithful.
[24:59] and true. He won't forget his

[36:45] you. No rules, no
[36:50] religion. I've made my
[36:54] decision to run to you. the healer that
[36:59] I
[37:02] [Applause]
[37:06] need. Take me to the
[37:11] king. I don't have much to
[37:15] bring. My heart is torn in
[37:21] pieces. It's my offering.
[37:26] Lay me at the
[37:30] throne. Leave me there
[37:35] alone to gaze upon your
[37:40] gloryy and sing to you this
[37:44] song. Please take me to the
[37:48] [Music]
[37:52] king. Lord, we're in the way.
[37:57] We keep making
[37:59] [Music]
[38:01] mistakes. The gloryy's not for us. It's
[38:06] all for
[38:13] you. Please take me to my
[38:18] king. I don't have much to bring.
[38:24] My heart is torn in
[38:28] pieces. It's my
[38:33] offering. Lay me at the
[38:38] throne. Leave me there
[38:42] alone to gaze upon your sweet
[38:47] glory and sing to you this song.
[38:52] Please take me to my
[38:55] [Music]
[39:03] king.
[39:07] Amen. That's what our desire is to go
[39:10] before the king prepared like John saw
[39:14] that holy city New Jerusalem coming down
[39:16] out of heaven prepared as a bride
[39:18] adorned for her husband. And Esther took
[39:21] 12 months of preparations to make
[39:24] herself ready. And I believe this bride
[39:26] has made herself ready. She's wrapped
[39:28] herself in the message of the hour. She
[39:31] took six months just soaking in myrr and
[39:34] making sure that she had the right kind
[39:36] of a worship and a smell that was going
[39:38] forth to the father before she would
[39:41] present herself before the king. Then
[39:43] she would take and she would make sure
[39:45] all the cosmetics and all the how that
[39:47] everything was just destined right. I
[39:49] believe that's so important that we
[39:51] bathe oursel naturally. We perfume
[39:54] oursel naturally. We cover we cover the
[39:56] stench of this world naturally. We bathe
[39:59] oursel and then we come in spiritually
[40:01] and we bathe oursel in the word of his
[40:04] presence and let him wash us and make us
[40:06] new in his presence. I think it's great
[40:09] to take a shower in the presence of the
[40:11] Holy Ghost. Don't you? To go before our
[40:14] king. go before our king in worship, in
[40:17] adoration, praising the name of the Lord
[40:19] Jesus Christ. And that's what we've done
[40:22] today. We've come here to be washed by
[40:24] his presence, to be made new and let him
[40:27] come and bathe us and make us make our
[40:30] worship so pure and so holy that we come
[40:33] before the king just perfectly on that
[40:36] day. That's our desire. Amen. Didn't you
[40:40] just enjoy the word of the Lord last
[40:42] evening? It was so rich and perfect. And
[40:45] we're just looking unto the Lord today.
[40:47] We just want to make oursel ready before
[40:49] the Lord today as brother Aaron would
[40:51] prepare to come. Maybe you'll just stand
[40:53] with us this this morning. Amen. How
[40:56] many has a need that you'd like to make
[40:58] known to the Lord? You'd just like the
[41:00] Lord to come and minister to you. Maybe
[41:03] Kia G will play that song. I trust in
[41:05] God.
[41:06] Just ask the Lord to come whether it's
[41:09] physically, spiritually, emotionally, no
[41:11] matter what stage of life that you're
[41:13] in. I want you to be very specific with
[41:16] the Lord Jesus this morning. He's the
[41:18] kind of God that likes to take little
[41:21] children up and let them drink from his
[41:23] cup and minister to them. He goes to the
[41:26] elderly. There's no stipulation on
[41:28] healing, no matter how old we are. I
[41:31] believe in divine healing and I believe
[41:33] in divine health that our Lord Jesus
[41:35] Christ can minister to the little, to
[41:37] the weak, to the strong. And I believe
[41:40] he's in this room this morning to
[41:41] minister to you no matter your case, no
[41:43] matter your situation. Why don't you
[41:45] just put your trust in Jesus this
[41:47] morning? Amen. Oh, blessed
[41:53] asssurance. Oh, Jesus is mine.
[42:00] He's been my fourth man in the
[42:05] fire time after
[42:10] time. Oh, born of his
[42:13] [Music]
[42:16] spirit. Oh, washed in his blood.
[42:23] And what he did for me, oh Cal, is more
[42:29] than
[42:33] enough. So I trust in
[42:37] God whom my
[42:40] savior, the
[42:42] one who will
[42:46] never fail.
[42:52] He will never
[42:55] [Music]
[42:56] fail. So I trust in
[43:00] God. Oh my
[43:03] savior, the
[43:05] one who will
[43:09] never
[43:12] [Music]
[43:14] fail. He will never fail.
[43:20] Oh, perfect
[43:25] submission. Oh, all is at
[43:31] rest. I know the author of
[43:37] tomorrow has ordered my stay.
[43:43] So this is my
[43:49] story and this is my
[43:55] song. I'm praising my rising king and
[44:01] s all the day
[44:04] long. So I
[44:07] trust. So I trust in
[44:10] God whom my
[44:14] savior the
[44:16] one who will
[44:20] never
[44:25] fail. He will never
[44:28] fail. Can you trust him in that? So I
[44:32] trust in God.
[44:35] Oh my
[44:38] savior, the
[44:40] one who will
[44:44] never
[44:47] [Music]
[44:49] fail. He will never
[44:56] fail. So I sought the Lord and he heard
[45:01] and he answered. I sought the Lord and
[45:06] he heard and he answered. I sought the
[45:11] Lord and he heard and he
[45:14] answered. That's why I
[45:17] trusted. That's why I trusted. I sought
[45:22] the Lord and he heard and he answered. I
[45:27] sought the Lord and he heard and he
[45:32] answered. I sought the Lord and he heard
[45:37] and he
[45:38] answered. That's why I trust him. That's
[45:43] why I trusted. I sought the Lord and he
[45:48] heard and he answered. I sought the Lord
[45:53] and he heard and he ate. Hallelujah. Why
[45:58] don't you send up an offering unto him,
[46:00] a sweet smelling
[46:02] savior. That's why I trust him. That's
[46:07] why I trust him. I sought the Lord and
[46:11] he heard. Why don't you trust him in
[46:14] your finances? Why don't you trust him
[46:16] in your healing? Why don't you trust him
[46:18] in your marriage?
[46:23] Hallelujah. He'll hear you one more
[46:26] time. I saw the
[46:28] Lord. I sought him. I saw him. I saw
[46:32] him. I sought the Lord and he heard and
[46:37] he answered. I sought the Lord and he
[46:42] heard and he answered. I sought the Lord
[46:47] and he heard and he
[46:50] answered. That's why I trust him. That's
[46:55] why I trust in
[46:58] God. Oh, my
[47:01] savior, the
[47:04] one who will
[47:07] [Music]
[47:08] never fail.
[47:11] [Music]
[47:14] He will never
[47:19] fail. So I trust in
[47:23] God, my
[47:26] savior, the
[47:29] one who you
[47:33] never fail.
[47:36] [Music]
[47:43] Hallelujah. Oh Lord God

[47:55] majesty. Oh the heavens
[47:58] declare your wonderers.

[48:34] things. Oh you have done great
[48:37] things. Oh mighty you

[49:17] [Music]
[49:28] [Music]
[49:40] might hallelujah. Have you found him to
[49:42] be mighty in your life? Amen. We serve
[49:46] such a wonderful, awesome God. So, so
[49:49] thankful to have this opportunity again
[49:51] to be gathered with you. We just so
[49:53] enjoyed his presence last night. So
[49:56] enjoyed being with you. We've heard
[49:58] wonderful reports this morning from from
[50:01] Ohio and your pastor, brother Ron, just
[50:04] did a phenomenal job last night. I I
[50:07] know that's exactly what we expected and
[50:09] he he sure did a wonderful job. And just
[50:12] want to tell you again how much we love
[50:13] and appreciate you. Bring greetings from
[50:15] our our pastor back home, brother Tim.
[50:18] Just sends his love and greetings to
[50:19] you. Amen. So let's just pray
[50:22] together. Heavenly Father, Lord, truly
[50:26] you have done great things. Lord, I I
[50:28] stand here Lord as a testament to the
[50:30] miracle working power. Lord, I look
[50:33] across this audience and I see miracle
[50:35] after miracle after miracle, Lord. You
[50:38] are a mighty God, Lord. And today, Lord,
[50:40] we recognize the mighty things you've
[50:42] done in this generation, Lord, to turn a
[50:44] people back to the faith of the fathers,
[50:47] Lord. We thank you for that. So today,
[50:49] Lord, we're not, Lord, struggling along,
[50:51] blinded, Lord, with no light, Lord,
[50:54] trapped in mystery Babylon, Lord. But
[50:56] today, there's a people that are free,
[50:58] that are, Lord, return back to the
[51:00] homeland. And we just want to say thank
[51:02] you, Lord. Lord, help us, Lord Jesus,
[51:04] along the journey. Help us, Lord God, to
[51:06] keep our eyes on the prize, Lord. Help
[51:08] us not be distracted by all the comforts
[51:10] of Babylon around us today, Father.
[51:13] Lord, I pray that you'll just help us,
[51:14] Lord, as we look into your word to find
[51:17] something that would benefit and edify
[51:18] your people. Lord, may you just use me
[51:20] to step aside, Lord, at any moment and
[51:22] speak a word, Lord. Lord, that you would
[51:24] have spoken for your people. We love
[51:26] you. Ask you to anoint, Lord, every
[51:28] aspect, everything that's said. If there
[51:30] be anything that you don't want said, I
[51:32] pray you would take control and just
[51:33] close my mouth. Father, we love you. We
[51:36] commit this time to you now. In Jesus
[51:38] name we pray. Amen. And amen. God bless
[51:42] you. If you if you have your Bibles with
[51:44] you and you'd like to turn with me to
[51:45] the book of Isaiah 44 and just kind of
[51:49] want to give a heads up to
[51:52] our friends working in the booth on the
[51:55] scriptures. We're going to we're going
[51:57] to read a lot of scripture today. I hope
[51:58] that's okay. We're going to go through a
[52:00] lot of scriptures and try to lay some
[52:02] things in and and um I'll make sure I
[52:05] allow plenty of time for them to keep up
[52:07] with us. Amen. Isaiah 44 and verse 28.
[52:12] And then we're going to read from Isaiah
[52:14] 45. I'd like to uh speak to you today on
[52:17] a thought, returning to
[52:20] receive. Returning to receive. And verse
[52:25] 28 here says, "That saith of
[52:29] Cyrus, he is my shepherd and shall
[52:32] perform all my pleasure, even saying to
[52:35] Jerusalem, thou shalt be built, and to
[52:39] the temple, thy
[52:41] foundations shall be laid." If we look
[52:44] now in Isaiah 45 and verse
[52:47] one says, "Thus saith the Lord to his
[52:50] anointed to Cyrus, whose right hand I
[52:54] have holden to subdue nations before
[52:57] him, and I will loose the loins of kings
[52:59] to open before him the two leaved gates,
[53:02] and the gates shall not be shut." If
[53:05] we'll skip down to verse
[53:07] 13, I have raised him up in
[53:10] righteousness, and I will direct all his
[53:12] ways. He shall build my city. He shall
[53:16] let go my captives, not for price nor
[53:19] reward, saith the Lord of hosts. Amen.
[53:23] You can have your seats this morning. We
[53:25] just pray the Lord add his blessing to
[53:26] the reading of the word. And and as we
[53:30] go through this, I kind of just want to
[53:32] just tell you right up front where we're
[53:34] going and and and what I want you to
[53:36] keep in mind. I don't I don't want it to
[53:37] be a a mystery to you. You know, a lot
[53:39] of times I I always say that's the
[53:41] problem with mystery preachers is a lot
[53:43] of time when they get done, it's still a
[53:45] mystery. And and so I don't want this to
[53:48] be mysterious at all. I want us to know
[53:50] together where we're going. And and I I
[53:52] want to look at Israel and their
[53:54] captivity in Babylon and then their
[53:57] return back to the homeland as it
[54:00] relates to the church down through the
[54:02] ages and and and her captivity in the
[54:06] Roman Catholic Church or mystery Babylon
[54:09] and and how God had promised a
[54:11] restoration. And because we know that
[54:13] Israel is a a a type of the church and
[54:16] and we know that that Israel had strayed
[54:18] away from God and and because of this
[54:21] they were exiled and taken down to
[54:23] Babylon and and and spent 70 years of
[54:26] exile there just as Jeremiah had
[54:28] foretold. So So as we talk about Israel,
[54:30] just keep that right in mind. We're also
[54:32] talking about the church. We're we're
[54:34] talking about that. And Israel had
[54:36] strayed and and spent 70 years in exile.
[54:39] And this exile greatly affected them as
[54:41] a nation. It it affected their culture.
[54:44] It it affected their worship. And and as
[54:48] they're stuck there, they they made
[54:49] attempts not to lose what they had. They
[54:53] came together in in communities and they
[54:55] wanted to to to not forget what it had
[54:57] been like in the homeland. and they they
[54:59] didn't want to lose all their traditions
[55:01] and and and so they they made efforts
[55:03] and they made attempts to continue on
[55:05] worshiping how they had done in the
[55:08] homeland. Scholars point back to this
[55:11] time in Babylon as the time that
[55:13] synagogues were actually founded because
[55:16] before this they would worship at the
[55:17] temple but now they they began to to
[55:20] found synagogues and establish
[55:22] synagogues and and services were held
[55:24] and and they observed holidays in these
[55:26] synagogues. They they prayed in these
[55:28] synagogues. They they practiced
[55:30] circumcision here. And and and the
[55:33] traditions of their religions was
[55:35] carried on here. And and so as we look
[55:38] at that, there was really no problem
[55:39] with their worship. They they were doing
[55:41] the best that they could with what they
[55:44] had. All right? That they they were that
[55:46] even though they couldn't fully worship
[55:48] in spirit and in truth and and even
[55:51] though they couldn't go back to the
[55:52] temple to sacrifice, they were doing the
[55:54] best they could. The issue wasn't their
[55:58] worship. The issue was when an
[56:00] opportunity came to go back to the
[56:03] homeland, they had become comfortable in
[56:06] their traditions. They had become
[56:09] comfortable carrying on with stories and
[56:11] how things used to be. And now all of a
[56:14] sudden there's an opportunity that says
[56:16] you can go back and they thought but why
[56:21] why do we need to go back? So the
[56:24] opportunity comes to go back to the
[56:26] original and they no longer saw the need
[56:30] to be restored back.
[56:33] 2 Chronicles
[56:35] 36:23 it says, "Thus sayaith Cyrus, king
[56:38] of Persia, all the kingdoms of the earth
[56:41] hath the Lord God of heaven given me,
[56:43] and he hath charged me to build him a
[56:45] house in
[56:47] Jerusalem." Says, which is in Judah, now
[56:49] here's the important part. Who is there
[56:52] among you? Of all his people, the Lord
[56:57] his God be with him. Let him go
[57:01] up. And scholars would go back and say
[57:04] if we were attach to attach a percentage
[57:07] perhaps those who left Babylon, it would
[57:10] be it would amount to no more than 10%.
[57:16] 10% of those who were in Babylon
[57:19] decided, "I want to go back." 90% said,
[57:23] "No, no, no, no. I'm good here in my
[57:25] church tradition. I'm good right here
[57:29] where I'm at." They they had been given
[57:32] instructions by the prophet to tar in
[57:35] Babylon. If you'll look with me in
[57:37] Jeremiah 29
[57:39] and5, it says, "Build ye houses and
[57:42] dwell in them. Plant gardens and eat the
[57:45] fruit of them. Take ye wives and begget
[57:49] sons and daughters, and take wives for
[57:51] your sons, and give your daughters to
[57:53] husbands, that they may bear sons and
[57:56] daughters, that you may be increased
[57:57] there, and not diminished, and seek
[58:00] peace of the city, whether I have caused
[58:02] you to be carried away captives, and
[58:04] pray unto the Lord for it, for in the
[58:06] peace thereof, you shall have peace." In
[58:09] other words, they had a prophet tell
[58:10] him, "Plant your potatoes.
[58:12] [Music]
[58:13] plant your potatoes. Do the best you can
[58:16] while you're here. But what happened is
[58:19] they got caught up in the tearing.
[58:22] They got caught up in the waiting and
[58:24] they lost focus on the purpose. Because
[58:26] see, it's verse 10 that's the important
[58:28] part. They got caught up in this. But in
[58:31] verse 10 it says, "For thus sayaeth the
[58:33] Lord after 70 years be performed be
[58:37] accomplished at Babylon. I will visit
[58:40] you and perform my good word toward you
[58:43] in causing you to return to this place."
[58:48] In other words, that works for a while.
[58:50] That's my will. But there's coming a
[58:51] time that you can't stay there no more.
[58:54] There's coming a time that I'm going to
[58:55] say, "Come out of her, my people. Don't
[58:58] get too comfortable where you're at.
[59:02] Don't get too comfortable in the taring.
[59:05] But what happens is they got too busy to
[59:07] think about leaving. They got too busy
[59:10] for prayer time. They got too caught up
[59:12] in the cares of life. They were
[59:14] successful where they were at. They had
[59:16] so much invested in Babylon. Many of
[59:20] them never knew the homeland for
[59:21] themselves. Never. The homeland was just
[59:24] stories. The way God used to move was
[59:26] just stories. The miracles was just
[59:29] stories. The pouring out of his spirit
[59:31] was just stories. But there was some of
[59:33] them that had tasted it before. There
[59:35] was some of them that were from that
[59:37] homeland and they said, "This is not my
[59:39] home, but something's drawing me back to
[59:42] the original."
[59:44] Hallelujah.
[59:46] They got comfortable being down in
[59:48] Babylon.
[59:50] Why wouldn't the opportunity to return
[59:53] to the promised land cause a massive
[59:55] exodus from Babylon?
[59:58] They had settled into their religion
[1:00:00] where they were. They had grown
[1:00:02] accustomed to a to a little bit of
[1:00:04] Babylon mixed into their beliefs.
[1:00:09] They didn't see the need for an Acts 238
[1:00:12] experience.
[1:00:13] They didn't see the need anymore for an
[1:00:15] Acts 4 experience. They just believed on
[1:00:18] the Lord
[1:00:21] or they just believed that God sent a
[1:00:22] prophet and figured they could stay
[1:00:24] where they were at and be okay. But God
[1:00:29] had provided an opportunity to go back.
[1:00:33] And when he says go back, you better go
[1:00:36] back. If God says move, it's time to
[1:00:38] move. If God says do something, you
[1:00:41] better do it and not debate about it.
[1:00:43] Wonder why or I like it here. I'm
[1:00:45] comfortable here. When God says cross
[1:00:47] over, you cross over.
[1:00:50] You can find an example of Reuben and
[1:00:52] Gad on on their journey through through
[1:00:54] the wilderness in the 40 years, they
[1:00:56] they had they had built up and got so
[1:00:59] many
[1:01:00] flocks. They had so many sheep that when
[1:01:03] they got to the well-watered plains on
[1:01:05] this side of Jordan, they didn't see the
[1:01:08] need to cross over into the promised
[1:01:09] land. They said, "This land suits me
[1:01:12] better.
[1:01:14] working on Sundays suits me better
[1:01:17] because look what I've got. Look what
[1:01:20] I've accomplished. Look what I have
[1:01:22] accumulated. And if you'll study the
[1:01:24] history of it, you'll find that Reuben
[1:01:26] and Gad went into captivity and exile
[1:01:30] almost 30 years before any of the other
[1:01:32] tribes because they were on the wrong
[1:01:35] side of Jordan. What am I telling you? I
[1:01:38] don't care what you've accumulated in
[1:01:39] Babylon. I don't care how blessed you've
[1:01:42] been in Babylon. There has been a call.
[1:01:44] Go forth. Be not partakers of her
[1:01:47] plagues. It's time to cross over. Don't
[1:01:49] stop short. Don't stop on this side of
[1:01:52] the Holy Ghost. You go all the way to
[1:01:54] the upper room and you get filled with
[1:01:56] the spirit and say, "I'm crossing over
[1:01:59] today into what God has provided for
[1:02:01] me."
[1:02:03] If he says, "Return, return."
[1:02:06] Hallelujah. Because I don't care how
[1:02:09] good life is for you, you can't stay
[1:02:12] here.
[1:02:14] We cannot stay here. We can't get too
[1:02:17] comfortable
[1:02:18] here. Isaiah is writing this more than a
[1:02:21] hundred years prior to Cyrus taking
[1:02:25] control of
[1:02:26] Babylon. And he calls Cyrus the anointed
[1:02:29] of the Lord. He says, "I will direct his
[1:02:32] ways and he shall build my city and he
[1:02:35] shall free my people." Listen, God does
[1:02:39] things the way he wants to do it.
[1:02:43] God uses who he wants to use. It doesn't
[1:02:47] have to be how you're expecting it this
[1:02:49] morning.
[1:02:51] Think about it. It don't have to be when
[1:02:53] you expect it or who who you expect. God
[1:02:57] is in control. No matter what we think,
[1:02:59] he uses who he wants to use to
[1:03:02] accomplish what he wants to accomplish.
[1:03:04] God chose Cyrus,
[1:03:08] a pagan polytheistic king to set his
[1:03:12] people free and send them back. Think
[1:03:16] about it. Sometimes we get so caught up
[1:03:18] in the vessel God's using instead of
[1:03:21] hearing what God's saying through the
[1:03:23] vessel.
[1:03:25] Well, I don't like this and I don't like
[1:03:27] that. You're missing the message. That's
[1:03:29] right. You're missing the point. Well,
[1:03:31] why is it always this? And why is it
[1:03:33] always this person? Oh, of course that.
[1:03:35] I mean, they're family.
[1:03:37] And you're missing the message. God uses
[1:03:40] who God wants to use to accomplish what
[1:03:42] God wants to accomplish. And he don't
[1:03:44] ask our opinion about it. We just got to
[1:03:47] get to the place that we say, "Yes,
[1:03:48] Lord. I hear your voice. I hear you
[1:03:51] speaking to me. Let me yield to what
[1:03:54] you're saying."
[1:03:56] Hallelujah.
[1:03:58] Well, surely a great deliverer is going
[1:04:00] to rise up like Moses. Surely God's
[1:04:03] going to use one of our brethren, one of
[1:04:05] the priests from the original temple.
[1:04:07] God's going to use him. Nope. Cyrus, a
[1:04:11] polytheistic king that believes in many
[1:04:15] gods. They're going to be delivered how
[1:04:17] God wants them to be. That's why they
[1:04:20] couldn't recognize Jesus.
[1:04:23] It didn't come how they expected him to
[1:04:25] come. Don't miss God in a service
[1:04:27] because he's not moving the way you
[1:04:29] expect him to move.
[1:04:33] Don't miss God in your life because you
[1:04:35] got a certain way you're expecting it to
[1:04:38] happen. Just say, "God, help me
[1:04:40] recognize you when you're working. Help
[1:04:43] me see you in all your ways. Help me
[1:04:46] accept it when you come down and move in
[1:04:48] my life.
[1:04:51] God does it the way he wants. Listen,
[1:04:54] the message came how God wanted it to
[1:04:57] come, exactly how he want. Well, surely
[1:05:00] through this organization and surely a a
[1:05:02] great doctor of divinity and sure, nope.
[1:05:05] William Brown,
[1:05:07] that's the messenger. That's who God
[1:05:10] chose. Well, I don't like how he said,
[1:05:12] "What about that?" That's who God chose.
[1:05:14] He said, "This is the message of
[1:05:16] deliverance. This is the opportunity to
[1:05:18] go back. You can get on board or you can
[1:05:20] be left behind. But there is a
[1:05:22] percentage. Maybe 1%, maybe 2%. Whatever
[1:05:26] it is, count me in that percentage that
[1:05:28] says I'm going back to the homeland.
[1:05:33] Hallelujah. God chose the messenger. And
[1:05:36] he sent the message and it was foretold
[1:05:39] exactly in Malachi 4. We know this well.
[1:05:42] Malachi 4:5. Behold, I will send you
[1:05:44] Elijah the prophet before the coming of
[1:05:47] the great and dreadful day of the Lord.
[1:05:49] And he shall turn the heart of the
[1:05:51] fathers to the children, and the heart
[1:05:53] of the children to the fathers, lest I
[1:05:55] come and smite the earth with a curse.
[1:05:58] What is this
[1:05:59] prophecy? It's a prophecy of an
[1:06:02] opportunity to go back.
[1:06:06] An opportunity to return to the land of
[1:06:08] the word. an opportunity to return to
[1:06:11] the faith of the fathers. The church had
[1:06:14] need to turn back because they had found
[1:06:16] themselves down in
[1:06:17] Babylon. They had found themselves
[1:06:20] captured and and they started free and
[1:06:22] full of power right there in Jerusalem
[1:06:24] and and the spirit moved free and they
[1:06:27] operated according to to Mark 16 and and
[1:06:30] according to James 5 and and there were
[1:06:33] no claims of the church of a false
[1:06:35] trinity. There was no false doctrines,
[1:06:37] no false baptisms. the the doctrines and
[1:06:40] the deeds of the nickelatans had not
[1:06:42] taken hold on the church yet.
[1:06:45] Listen, the church I don't even
[1:06:47] understand why this is a debate amongst
[1:06:49] some folk.
[1:06:50] But the church at Pentecost was the
[1:06:53] pattern.
[1:06:55] They were the standard. That's right.
[1:06:57] They were the original. That's right.
[1:07:00] Prophet of God says Pentecost was our
[1:07:03] pattern. That's right. That's there's no
[1:07:05] question mark. There's no commas. That's
[1:07:07] a sentence. Pentecost was our pattern.
[1:07:11] He says, "No one will have to say, but
[1:07:13] what the church was inaugurated on the
[1:07:14] day of Pentecost." Thus, what the church
[1:07:17] was at Pentecost is the standard. Amen.
[1:07:20] Why do people get upset when we talk
[1:07:22] about going back to Pentecost? We just
[1:07:24] put it like this. Hey, we're trying to
[1:07:26] be exactly what God wanted the church to
[1:07:28] be.
[1:07:29] We're trying to match what God wanted us
[1:07:31] to match. And people get bothered by
[1:07:33] that. I just want to be what God said.
[1:07:36] Here's the pattern. Lord, let me match
[1:07:38] that pattern. No matter if it's popular,
[1:07:40] no matter if it's old, no matter people
[1:07:42] ridicule, I want to do it God's way. I
[1:07:46] want to match his pattern.
[1:07:48] He says there is no other pattern. No
[1:07:52] matter what the scholars say, God has
[1:07:54] not changed the pattern. Now, here's the
[1:07:56] thing. People say, "Well, days gone by
[1:07:58] this, that, and the other." Here's what
[1:07:59] the prophet says. What God did at
[1:08:01] Pentecost, he has to keep on doing until
[1:08:04] the church ages close. The true church
[1:08:09] will always try to be like the original
[1:08:13] at Pentecost. The true church will try
[1:08:16] to approximate that early first one.
[1:08:20] That's right. Well, y'all are just
[1:08:21] trying to be like Pentecost. Yeah. The
[1:08:22] prophet told us to be. That's right.
[1:08:26] As a matter of fact, he said the true
[1:08:27] church will always try to be like the
[1:08:30] first church at Pentecost. He makes it
[1:08:33] very clear what the pattern is and and
[1:08:35] what we're to be like. But what happened
[1:08:38] to that first
[1:08:40] church, the same thing that happened to
[1:08:42] Israel, they left their first love and
[1:08:46] they followed after other gods. They
[1:08:49] begin to drift and allow the ideas of
[1:08:51] man into the church. Listen, if I can
[1:08:54] encourage you in any way this weekend,
[1:08:57] don't leave your first love.
[1:09:00] Fall in love with Jesus all over again.
[1:09:03] Well, I got this, brother, and I got
[1:09:05] this situ. Fall in love with Jesus. Fall
[1:09:07] in love with him more than you ever have
[1:09:09] before. Seek him more than you ever have
[1:09:11] before. Don't let other things rise to
[1:09:13] the same level of importance as your
[1:09:16] relationship with Jesus Christ. There is
[1:09:18] nothing that should reach that level
[1:09:20] because when that happens, then the the
[1:09:22] revival fires begin to die. Then the
[1:09:24] lukewarmness begins to creep in. Next
[1:09:26] thing you know, you're wandering around
[1:09:28] and where's God? Where's God? You want
[1:09:30] to find God? Go back to where you left
[1:09:32] him. Go back to when you prayed. Go back
[1:09:34] to when you worshiped. Go back to when
[1:09:36] you read the word and listen to the
[1:09:38] message. Go back where you left him at.
[1:09:42] Stay in love with Jesus.
[1:09:44] But that first church left their first
[1:09:46] love. And the prophet of God says the
[1:09:48] fervent desire to please God, the
[1:09:51] passion to know his word, the the cry
[1:09:53] for reaching out in the spirit all began
[1:09:55] to
[1:09:56] fade. And instead of that church being
[1:09:59] on fire with the fire of God, it cooled
[1:10:02] off. Full Gospel
[1:10:04] Lighthouse, don't ever cool off.
[1:10:08] Don't ever cool off. Don't ever get
[1:10:10] lukewarm. Don't ever let the devil rob
[1:10:13] your worship. Don't ever give ear to the
[1:10:15] people criticizing and talking. Listen,
[1:10:17] don't ever let the fire of God leave
[1:10:20] this place, the passion for the word,
[1:10:22] the passion for worship, the passion to
[1:10:24] come together and give him your
[1:10:26] everything. Don't ever cool off. You are
[1:10:29] a lighthouse to the world of how to be
[1:10:31] free in the spirit, how to worship a
[1:10:33] living God. Let that light shine service
[1:10:36] after service after service.
[1:10:39] Don't ever give into this lukewarm
[1:10:41] denominational layout of kind of
[1:10:43] worship. You give God your everything.
[1:10:52] He says they become a bit formal.
[1:10:56] That is what was happening back there to
[1:10:57] the Ephesians. They was getting a bit
[1:11:00] formal. The second generation coming on
[1:11:03] was just like Israel. They demanded a
[1:11:05] king to be like other nations. When they
[1:11:08] did that, they rejected God, but they
[1:11:10] did it anyway. That is the history of
[1:11:13] the church. They let down the bars and
[1:11:16] goats come in and took over. The cry of
[1:11:18] joy was gone. The freedom of the spirit
[1:11:22] was gone. Oh, they kept on with the
[1:11:24] form, but the fire had died down and the
[1:11:27] blackness of ashes is all that was left.
[1:11:30] But as usual, people don't heed God's
[1:11:33] warning. The revival fire built upon the
[1:11:36] sacred word is so wonderful. Listen, the
[1:11:39] manifestation of the spirit is so
[1:11:41] blessed that a little fear creeps in and
[1:11:44] whispers in the heart and says, "How can
[1:11:46] we protect the truth we have? What can
[1:11:50] we do to see this revival goes on?" That
[1:11:53] is when the antichrist spirit comes in
[1:11:55] and whispers, "Look, you have the truth
[1:11:58] now. See that it doesn't get lost."
[1:12:03] Isn't that something that the Antichrist
[1:12:06] actually works through trying to get
[1:12:08] people to protect the truth? Because it
[1:12:11] our idea of protecting things is to
[1:12:13] build walls.
[1:12:16] And the word of God tears walls down.
[1:12:19] That's right. Now, don't get me wrong,
[1:12:21] there are walls of fortification that
[1:12:23] the Holy Spirit will build and things
[1:12:26] that he puts in our life. You know, a
[1:12:27] lot of people and a lot of young people,
[1:12:29] I want to say this to you. A lot of
[1:12:30] times you look at the standards of the
[1:12:32] word and the standards and you look at
[1:12:34] it as a prison. Well, I'm stuck inside
[1:12:37] here and and they don't let me do
[1:12:39] nothing. And and listen, if you'll begin
[1:12:41] to look at it just a little different
[1:12:43] and realize that ain't a prison, but
[1:12:44] it's your castle. It's your
[1:12:46] fortification that God has put around
[1:12:48] you to protect you from the darks of the
[1:12:50] enemy and the fires of the enemy and the
[1:12:53] ws of the devil. And just begin to look
[1:12:55] at those things a little different. It's
[1:12:56] not to keep you, you know, keep you in
[1:12:59] and never let you live. It's to make
[1:13:00] sure you live eternally. It's to make
[1:13:03] sure, it's to keep you from being
[1:13:04] scarred. I just want to go here for a
[1:13:06] minute. Listen, I know sometimes we look
[1:13:07] at lives and we're like, "Well, they did
[1:13:09] all this and they lived in the world and
[1:13:10] they made it and they're doing okay. I
[1:13:12] wish to God I could go back to 10 and 11
[1:13:15] and 12 and start this thing over." And
[1:13:18] yeah, yeah, God by his grace has changed
[1:13:20] me. But I live with scars every single
[1:13:22] day. I have mind battles every single
[1:13:24] day. I struggle with things every single
[1:13:26] day because I sat right here and I
[1:13:28] thought maybe later, maybe later. Maybe
[1:13:30] later. If I could look back in my life
[1:13:32] and see myself, I'd say, "Don't get in
[1:13:34] that car with that friend. Don't go to
[1:13:36] that place with that friend. Why don't
[1:13:37] you come down to the altar and give your
[1:13:39] life to Jesus Christ and live for Jesus
[1:13:42] Christ and spare yourself the scars,
[1:13:44] spare yourself the hurt? Can you make
[1:13:47] it? Of course, you can make it. But I'm
[1:13:49] asking you to get inside the castle
[1:13:51] today and save yourself a lifetime of
[1:13:54] hurt and heartache.
[1:14:11] God ain't going to lose you. You're
[1:14:14] here. You're his. I'm just offering you
[1:14:16] an opportunity to avoid those roads.
[1:14:22] The revival fire is cooled
[1:14:25] off. And right here is where the capture
[1:14:28] takes place. Right here is where the
[1:14:30] church goes down to Babylon. The very
[1:14:32] moment that they organize that first
[1:14:35] move and the devil comes in and he uses
[1:14:37] the fear of losing the truth to ensnare
[1:14:40] the people.
[1:14:43] But even as God begins the
[1:14:45] restoration and we know God begins to
[1:14:48] move in Luther, the just shall live by
[1:14:51] faith. Even as the church began its
[1:14:54] journey back from exile to the
[1:14:57] restoration, even as God would send
[1:14:59] messengers down through the ages, that
[1:15:02] spirit kept working to keep people from
[1:15:04] going all the way back.
[1:15:07] Even if they left Rome, if he could just
[1:15:10] keep them with that same denominational
[1:15:14] mindset, that same denominational
[1:15:17] lifestyle, then he could keep a claim on
[1:15:19] them. if he could keep the church from
[1:15:22] being completely free, completely
[1:15:25] restored, and he would use the fear of
[1:15:27] losing the truth to do it. The the the
[1:15:30] revelation of justification was so
[1:15:32] special and it brought it brought so
[1:15:34] much freedom, but they walled it up so
[1:15:35] tight that they couldn't go on to
[1:15:38] sanctification. We must protect this
[1:15:41] truth. And then the revelation of
[1:15:43] sanctification was so special, being
[1:15:45] sanctified from the world, but they had
[1:15:48] to protect it. and they walled it up. So
[1:15:52] they couldn't move on. The gifts and the
[1:15:54] power are restored and they said, "This
[1:15:56] is
[1:15:57] it." And so they walled it up and they
[1:16:00] couldn't move on when God sent a
[1:16:02] prophet. But then God sends a prophet in
[1:16:05] this day. And we said, "This is
[1:16:09] it." And some have walled up so tight
[1:16:12] around God sent a prophet that they got
[1:16:14] more traditions than any of the
[1:16:16] denominations before us. Amen.
[1:16:20] And I thank God for every person who's
[1:16:22] recognized that God sent a prophet, but
[1:16:23] they're walled up so tight, they've
[1:16:25] never been able to go on into what the
[1:16:26] prophet said. They've never stepped into
[1:16:29] the message of the prophet. Listen, I
[1:16:31] hate to say it this way. There's a lot
[1:16:32] of people who know God sent a prophet
[1:16:35] who ain't going to make it because they
[1:16:36] say he's a prophet, but they've never
[1:16:38] received the message that the prophet
[1:16:40] brought. The message was not God sent a
[1:16:43] prophet. I want to make it clear. Thank
[1:16:45] God he did. Thank God you recognize
[1:16:47] that. But the message was not that he he
[1:16:50] called a people out of Babylon. He
[1:16:53] restored the truths of the ages. He
[1:16:55] said, "Come out of her, my people." You
[1:16:57] can't still be living a denominational
[1:17:00] life and saying, "God sent a prophet and
[1:17:02] think that's going to save you." He's
[1:17:04] calling you out of exile, back to the
[1:17:06] homeland, back to a relationship, back
[1:17:09] to the word, back to Jesus
[1:17:11] Christ. Hallelujah.
[1:17:17] Glory.
[1:17:19] And Babylon still holds a claim because
[1:17:22] it's the same spirit that worked in the
[1:17:24] Ephesian age. The prophet tells us the
[1:17:27] cry of joy was gone. The freedom of the
[1:17:29] spirit was gone. They kept on with a
[1:17:34] form. Listen, I ain't interested in a
[1:17:37] form. I ain't interested that we do
[1:17:39] every exact thing right and cross every
[1:17:41] tea and dot every eye. I'm interested
[1:17:43] that God has his way. I'm interested
[1:17:45] that God has his way in my life, that
[1:17:48] God has his way in your life, that we're
[1:17:50] led by the Holy Spirit, and that we're
[1:17:51] subject to the word of God. He will take
[1:17:54] care of everything else. Because there
[1:17:56] is a people that have been turned back,
[1:17:59] that their hearts has been turned back
[1:18:01] and they're refusing to stop short of
[1:18:04] going all the way. Where are we going?
[1:18:06] I'm going back to the homeland. Where
[1:18:08] you going, Brother Aaron? I'm going back
[1:18:09] to the original. It's a return to to to
[1:18:12] where and how our fathers worshiped. I'm
[1:18:16] going back to that place and I'm not
[1:18:18] going to stop along the journey. Listen,
[1:18:21] justifi sanctification was just on the
[1:18:23] way.
[1:18:25] It was a good place, but it was just
[1:18:27] along the way. Sanctification was just
[1:18:29] on the way. Isuza was just on the way.
[1:18:32] God sent a prophet was just on the way.
[1:18:35] You can't stop along the way. I'm going
[1:18:38] all the way back to where the message
[1:18:40] told me to go to.
[1:18:43] Hallelujah. It's a return. We're
[1:18:46] returning all the way.
[1:18:49] Hallelujah. Jeremiah prophesied that
[1:18:52] they would return back to the land of
[1:18:54] their fathers, the land of Abraham,
[1:18:56] Isaac, and Jacob. He says, "I will visit
[1:18:59] you and perform my good word towards you
[1:19:02] and causing you to return to this
[1:19:04] place." It's the same thing with with
[1:19:07] Malachi concerning the church. It
[1:19:09] prophesied that one's going to come that
[1:19:11] would turn our hearts back to the faith
[1:19:13] or to the land of Peter of Paul and
[1:19:18] Stephen. But getting away from their
[1:19:21] first love that that church fell into
[1:19:23] captivity and prophets and and different
[1:19:25] servants came and they they kept hope
[1:19:27] alive. They kept hope alive for a full
[1:19:30] return. and Malachi prophesied and Joel
[1:19:33] prophesied and and God sent men down
[1:19:35] through the ages to keep the faith alive
[1:19:37] that one day, one day there's going to
[1:19:40] be a full return. But finally, the
[1:19:43] return comes. Finally, there's an edict
[1:19:45] from the king. It's time to go back.
[1:19:49] It's time to rebuild. A prophet comes on
[1:19:52] the scene with a message from the king
[1:19:54] declaring Bible truth, declaring Bible
[1:19:57] doctrines. time to return to the
[1:19:59] original. You must have the token. Only
[1:20:03] to find that most Christians didn't want
[1:20:04] to go back.
[1:20:07] Only to find that most of them were
[1:20:09] happy right where they at. They they had
[1:20:10] gotten so comfortable in Babylon that
[1:20:13] they didn't want Bible holiness. That's
[1:20:14] right, Pre. They they didn't desire true
[1:20:17] Bible
[1:20:19] sanctification. They just wanted a form
[1:20:21] of godliness. What's wrong with with the
[1:20:23] synagogues we've built here in Babylon?
[1:20:26] What's wrong with the denominations
[1:20:28] we've built right here? What are you
[1:20:30] What are you saying's wrong with our
[1:20:32] church?
[1:20:34] Nothing. Listen, this ain't to knock
[1:20:37] other people's beliefs. This ain't to
[1:20:38] knock on Baptist. I say all the time, I
[1:20:40] thank God for Baptist. I wish we had
[1:20:43] more of them. World be a better place.
[1:20:47] This ain't to knock on the truth that
[1:20:49] people have.
[1:20:51] What's wrong with my church? Nothing.
[1:20:53] I'm just saying there's an opportunity
[1:20:55] to go back to the original. I'm just
[1:20:57] saying there's an opportunity to go back
[1:20:59] to how God started. He said, "This is
[1:21:02] how I want my church. Now, will you
[1:21:04] please come back? Come be a part of the
[1:21:06] original. Come rebuild the temple. Come
[1:21:09] be a part of it." And some of us said,
[1:21:12] "Yes, Lord, I'll go."
[1:21:16] But others
[1:21:17] said, "My church is good.
[1:21:21] Why do I want to go through all the
[1:21:22] struggle? Why do I want to go through
[1:21:24] the battle? Why? It's going to be a hard
[1:21:25] journey. I'm going to stay right
[1:21:28] here. But some of us, there was
[1:21:30] something in us calling us.
[1:21:32] Most didn't see the need. They had their
[1:21:35] religion and they they could keep their
[1:21:37] religion and hold on to the world, too.
[1:21:40] But the king decreed we could go
[1:21:42] back. We could rebuild the temple and
[1:21:45] have the same worship that our fathers
[1:21:46] had. we could rebuild the walls and have
[1:21:49] the same protection of the word that
[1:21:51] they had. And just like in Ezra, some
[1:21:54] came
[1:21:55] out. I love the books of Nehemiah and
[1:21:58] Ezra. You can find all this in those
[1:22:00] those two books. Just the story of of
[1:22:03] the return from exile and rebuilding the
[1:22:06] wall and rebuilding the temple. It's
[1:22:07] just awesome to see the hand of God in
[1:22:09] it. They say about 42,000 Jews
[1:22:13] eventually returned to Babylon over a
[1:22:16] period of years. Sounds like a lot, but
[1:22:18] in consideration of how many there were
[1:22:21] in Babylon, only 42,000 would leave and
[1:22:23] come back to Jerusalem,
[1:22:26] why didn't more come
[1:22:27] out? How could they see vindication
[1:22:30] night after night?
[1:22:34] How could they see the pillar of fire in
[1:22:36] operation? How could they see your name
[1:22:39] is Mrs. Jones and you live at 326 Psych
[1:22:42] Street. You're not from here. You're
[1:22:43] from a mountainous region.
[1:22:46] I see your doctor. He's a short man with
[1:22:48] glasses. How could they see that and go,
[1:22:49] "Oh, that's wonderful, but I'm going to
[1:22:51] stay right where I'm at."
[1:22:55] That's powerful, but I'm going to stay
[1:22:56] right where I'm at. How could they
[1:22:59] declare Bible days are here again?
[1:23:02] Listen, you go back and look at all the
[1:23:04] magazines and all the books and all the
[1:23:06] things written about the messenger,
[1:23:09] William Brham, in that
[1:23:11] day. We have to understand something.
[1:23:13] Maybe you don't get it, young people.
[1:23:14] Maybe you see all those books and
[1:23:16] magazines and all those things from back
[1:23:17] then. There was no such thing as message
[1:23:19] churches.
[1:23:21] Message churches did not exist. He
[1:23:24] wasn't preaching in message churches. He
[1:23:26] was preaching in denominational churches
[1:23:28] who most of all did not agree with what
[1:23:30] he was preaching. And yet they said
[1:23:33] Bible days are here again. They said
[1:23:36] this is a man sent from God. They said a
[1:23:38] prophet visit South Africa. They said it
[1:23:41] about him. God let them testify that
[1:23:45] this was the truth. This was the
[1:23:47] restored word. This was God working
[1:23:49] through a man. It wasn't message people
[1:23:51] saying it. They said
[1:23:53] [Applause]
[1:23:56] it. They declared
[1:23:59] it. And then they decided to stay where
[1:24:02] they were.
[1:24:08] Why? Why are you here? Think about it.
[1:24:14] This isn't to lift us up. We We had
[1:24:16] nothing to do with it.
[1:24:18] Why are you here when others stay? Why
[1:24:21] are you here when your family just can't
[1:24:23] see? It's so obvious to you. It's right
[1:24:24] here. It's It's black. It's written and
[1:24:26] they can't see
[1:24:28] it. I mean, there's times you just take
[1:24:30] a whatever doctrine you want that's just
[1:24:32] so clear to you and you think, "Man,
[1:24:34] serpent, see, that's so easy to see.
[1:24:36] That's so easy." And you and you show
[1:24:37] somebody and they're like, "You're
[1:24:39] crazy." Amen.
[1:24:42] Like, what do you mean I'm crazy? It
[1:24:43] says it right there. I'll put immity
[1:24:44] between I see there. I mean, it it says
[1:24:46] it like, can you read?
[1:24:50] Thank you. That's how I feel about
[1:24:55] it. It's easy, but they can't see it.
[1:24:59] Why are you here? And they're not. Once
[1:25:02] again, I'm not knocking on them. Many of
[1:25:04] them are worshiping all they know.
[1:25:07] God bless them. Many of them's going to
[1:25:09] be there. Don't ever get the idea us
[1:25:10] foreign no more. Don't ever don't ever
[1:25:13] get that idea. There's more grace in
[1:25:14] this message than what people want to
[1:25:16] recognize. There's a lot of your family
[1:25:19] and a lot of people maybe they just
[1:25:21] can't see it, but they're serving God to
[1:25:22] the best of their ability. I'd like you
[1:25:24] to know they're going to be there. You
[1:25:26] believe on the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:25:28] Christ, you shall be saved.
[1:25:32] Let's don't over complicate it.
[1:25:36] had a brother ask me recently. He said,
[1:25:38] you know, is is there salvation
[1:25:41] outside of the bride or what? That's not
[1:25:44] exactly how he worded it. And he and and
[1:25:45] I said, well, sure. There's a lot that
[1:25:47] come up at the great white throne
[1:25:48] judgment. It says they're granted life.
[1:25:50] And he said, "Well, why don't we preach
[1:25:52] that more to our people?" I said, "Well,
[1:25:53] let me put like this. I'm fully aware.
[1:25:57] I'm fully aware that not every single
[1:26:00] person is going to reach the level at
[1:26:02] which we preach it. I'm just being real
[1:26:04] for a minute. I hope we can all
[1:26:06] understand that. I said, "But if I
[1:26:08] preach them right here and I aim for
[1:26:10] this with all I got and I and they fall
[1:26:13] short, they fall short into eternal
[1:26:16] life."
[1:26:18] Thank you, Lord. But if I preach it down
[1:26:21] here getting by the skin of your teeth
[1:26:24] and you fall short, then you're lost. So
[1:26:27] I say preach heaven high and preach hell
[1:26:29] hot and let's strive with all of our
[1:26:32] heart to give Jesus everything we can
[1:26:34] and just pray for the grace of God to be
[1:26:37] merciful in our life. And listen, if I
[1:26:39] were to fall short, Jesus said there's
[1:26:41] grace cuz if you stood for me and you
[1:26:44] believe on my name, there is salvation
[1:26:47] for you.
[1:26:49] It's a merciful God. This message came
[1:26:52] crying, "Grace,
[1:26:55] grace, do not turn disgrace into
[1:26:58] judgment and put people into damnation."
[1:27:00] That's not what this message is about.
[1:27:03] It's saying, "Come and drink of the
[1:27:05] water of life freely, and whosoever
[1:27:08] will, if you're thirsty, come and
[1:27:12] drink. Come and drink."
[1:27:17] I'm going to go ahead and tell you
[1:27:19] people who are overly judgmental are
[1:27:21] people that have never experienced the
[1:27:23] grace and mercy of God.
[1:27:28] They've never experienced it for
[1:27:29] themselves, so they don't know how to
[1:27:31] give it.
[1:27:36] Ezra 1
[1:27:38] and5. Here's why you're
[1:27:41] here. Here's why you're here.
[1:27:44] says, ' Then rose up the chief of the
[1:27:47] fathers of Judah and Benjamin and the
[1:27:50] priest and the Levites. Here's your
[1:27:53] sentence. With all of them whose spirit
[1:27:57] God had
[1:27:59] raised everyone that went back went back
[1:28:02] because God's spirit had moved on. God's
[1:28:05] spirit had it wasn't just a guy wake up
[1:28:06] going, you know what? I feel like going
[1:28:08] and and and I'm a mason, so I'll go help
[1:28:11] build this wall. Amen. No, God moved.
[1:28:15] You're here because God moved. You're
[1:28:17] here because God pricricked your heart.
[1:28:18] You're here because God called you. It
[1:28:21] says to go up and build the house of the
[1:28:23] Lord which is in Jerusalem. It's no
[1:28:26] accident you're here this morning. Well,
[1:28:28] I'm here because I was born in this
[1:28:30] family and my family makes me come to
[1:28:32] church. True story. Been there.
[1:28:36] But that part's not an accident. You
[1:28:38] were born in that family for a purpose.
[1:28:40] So your parents can make you come to
[1:28:42] church. So you can sit here and have
[1:28:44] opportunity after opportunity after
[1:28:45] opportunity after opportunity after
[1:28:47] opportunity after opportunity.
[1:28:52] It's not an accident.
[1:28:55] If it was up to me, I'd be at home
[1:28:56] asleep. I know. That's why God didn't
[1:28:59] leave it up to you.
[1:29:02] God said, "I'm going to make sure that I
[1:29:04] get my own. I'm going to put this one
[1:29:07] with this one and that one with that one
[1:29:08] and protect this seed through this war.
[1:29:10] And then this one's going to make it
[1:29:11] here. He's almost going to die, but I'm
[1:29:12] not going to let him die because you got
[1:29:14] to be here. And I want you here to hear
[1:29:16] a word of mercy and a word of grace and
[1:29:19] a God calling you back. Home to the
[1:29:21] homeland. Babylon's not for you. The
[1:29:24] comforts of Babylon are not for you. The
[1:29:26] destruction of Babylon is not for you.
[1:29:29] But eternity is for you. Glory is for
[1:29:32] you. The original is for you
[1:29:35] today.
[1:29:37] [Applause]
[1:29:39] Hallelujah. Spirit of God has moved upon
[1:29:42] your heart to return. And not just to
[1:29:45] return, but to
[1:29:47] rebuild. You've been called to go home.
[1:29:50] There was something burning in the
[1:29:52] hearts of those 42,000. We've got to go
[1:29:55] back. We got to get back. We got We got
[1:29:57] to get back to the faith of the fathers.
[1:29:59] There's a work we got to do. I I can't
[1:30:01] be stopped. I won't be stopped. Think
[1:30:04] about it. People have told you you're
[1:30:05] crazy. Family's told you you're crazy.
[1:30:07] Everybody's told you you're crazy. You
[1:30:10] may be crazy, but that don't have
[1:30:12] nothing to do with this.
[1:30:14] There's a seed gene of God on the
[1:30:16] inside. And don't matter what this one
[1:30:17] says or that one says, it's drawing me.
[1:30:21] I can't stop. It's like I've been stuck
[1:30:23] in some kind of beam and it's pulling me
[1:30:26] home. I don't care how crazy I look. I
[1:30:29] don't care how crazy I sound. What I
[1:30:32] know is I'm leaving Babylon behind and
[1:30:34] I'm going back to the homeland of my
[1:30:37] fathers. Hallelujah. There's healing in
[1:30:39] that land. There's deliverance in that
[1:30:41] land. There's victory in that land.
[1:30:44] There's Holy Ghost in that land. There's
[1:30:46] tongues in that land. There's prophecy
[1:30:48] in that land. And I'm going
[1:30:50] back. Hallelujah.
[1:31:03] I will restore, sayeth the Lord.
[1:31:17] Typically, yeah, it's a long
[1:31:20] way. I will restore, sayeth the Lord.
[1:31:24] And the king begins to give back. Now,
[1:31:27] if y'all bear with me, we're going to
[1:31:29] read some scriptures.
[1:31:32] The king begins to give back all that
[1:31:34] was stolen through the years of
[1:31:36] Babylonian
[1:31:38] captivity. Ezra 1
[1:31:41] and7 also Cyrus the king brought forth
[1:31:43] the vessels of the house of the Lord
[1:31:46] which Nebuchadnezzar had brought out of
[1:31:48] Jerusalem and had put them in the house
[1:31:50] of his gods. In other words, these are
[1:31:53] things God gave his church and he said,
[1:31:54] "They don't belong out there. I don't
[1:31:56] care if they've made a mockery of
[1:31:57] dancing. It don't belong out there. I
[1:32:00] don't care if they've made a mockery of
[1:32:01] music and and they don't belong out
[1:32:03] there. That was for my people.
[1:32:06] And he would put it in the house of his
[1:32:07] gods and they were stolen from the
[1:32:10] original place of
[1:32:11] worship. Even those did Cyrus, king of
[1:32:14] Persia, bring forth by the hand of
[1:32:17] Mithrath the treasurer, and number them
[1:32:19] unto Bazar, the prince of Judah. And
[1:32:23] this is the number of them. 30 charges
[1:32:25] of gold, 1,000 charges of silvers are 20
[1:32:27] knives. 30 basins of gold, silver basins
[1:32:31] of a second sort, 410, and other vessels
[1:32:34] a thousand. And the vessels of gold and
[1:32:36] silver were 5, and 400. All these chesar
[1:32:40] bring up with them of the captivity that
[1:32:42] were brought up from Babylon back to
[1:32:44] Jerusalem. The king says, "These things,
[1:32:48] they belong in the house of God."
[1:32:50] It don't matter where they've been, how
[1:32:52] they've been misused. It don't matter.
[1:32:54] They belong in the house of God. These
[1:32:57] things were part of the original worship
[1:33:00] that is being restored. And I want them
[1:33:02] put back where they were taken from.
[1:33:06] Amen. This was taken from the church by
[1:33:09] Babylon. And and if you look down
[1:33:11] through the ages, see, there was
[1:33:12] doctrines robbed from the church. True
[1:33:14] baptism had been robbed. Godhead had
[1:33:17] been robbed. Serpent seed had been
[1:33:19] robbed. Eternal security, put them back
[1:33:22] where they belong. The supernatural was
[1:33:24] robbed. Put it back. Freedom of worship
[1:33:27] was robbed. Put it back. Oh, and the
[1:33:29] cankerworm took this and the palmer worm
[1:33:32] took this. Here are the gifts of the
[1:33:33] spirit. Put them back in the place of
[1:33:36] worship because it all belongs to my
[1:33:39] people. It doesn't belong out there.
[1:33:41] It's not some cast off has been thing.
[1:33:44] The king says, "Put it back in the house
[1:33:46] of God where it belongs." The king
[1:33:50] decrees, "Take these things back and put
[1:33:52] them back in the worship because in
[1:33:54] order to worship like they did at the
[1:33:56] original, you're going to need these.
[1:34:00] You're going to need these.
[1:34:02] Look, I I I don't
[1:34:04] know. I I It's easy for me to go down
[1:34:08] this road sometimes, but here we are.
[1:34:10] It's a nice
[1:34:12] road. I don't understand how we talk
[1:34:16] about going back to the original, going
[1:34:17] back to the original, going back to the
[1:34:18] original. And so, I just go to the book
[1:34:20] of Acts and read it.
[1:34:23] Don't just trust me. I I hope you do,
[1:34:26] but don't just trust me. Go read the
[1:34:29] book of Acts for yourself.
[1:34:31] If we're restored back to the fullness
[1:34:33] of the word and we're restored back to
[1:34:34] the way they worship, go see how they
[1:34:36] worship.
[1:34:39] [Music]
[1:34:43] Told you I was going to sing today. That
[1:34:44] That was it. That was
[1:34:48] it. That's not how they worship. It said
[1:34:51] they spilled out of that upper room. I
[1:34:53] tell you what, one of my favorite
[1:34:54] quotes, and I think we're allowed to
[1:34:55] have favorite quotes. One of my favorite
[1:34:57] quotes, it says they acted idiotic.
[1:35:01] So the next time somebody says, "Look at
[1:35:02] them bunch of idiots up there at Full
[1:35:04] Gospel Lighthouse."
[1:35:06] Glory. Yes, sir. That means I match
[1:35:10] those in the book of Acts. Brother
[1:35:12] Brandham said they acted idiotic. I
[1:35:14] ain't afraid of it. I ain't scared of
[1:35:17] it. I'm going back to that idiotic form
[1:35:20] of worship. I want it all. Pour it out.
[1:35:23] Lord, I ain't afraid. Cuz what man calls
[1:35:26] foolish, what man calls idiotic, God
[1:35:29] says that's how I like it right there.
[1:35:33] overflowing, full of joy. Put it back in
[1:35:36] the house of God. Take it
[1:35:40] back. Hallelujah.
[1:35:45] Hallelujah.
[1:35:53] It's not that we're trying to be
[1:35:54] difficult. We're trying to be original.
[1:35:58] I'm trying to match the pattern.
[1:36:01] It's what God said
[1:36:04] do. Even though there was opposition on
[1:36:07] every hand, the work began to
[1:36:10] rebuild. They were a small group, but
[1:36:14] the king provides every step of the way.
[1:36:16] Verse 7, Ezra 3 and
[1:36:20] 7 says, "They gave money also unto the
[1:36:23] masons and to the carpenters and meat
[1:36:26] and drink and oil unto them of Zidon and
[1:36:30] to them of Ty to bring cedar trees from
[1:36:33] Lebanon to the sea of Japa according."
[1:36:36] Now, why are all these people doing this
[1:36:37] for him? According to the grant that
[1:36:41] they had of Cyrus, king of Persia. In
[1:36:45] other words, the king said, "Give them
[1:36:46] what they need. Whatever they have need
[1:36:49] of, listen, it's not going to be easy
[1:36:50] going back, church. It's not going to be
[1:36:52] easy going all the way and crossing
[1:36:54] over." But the king says, "I got you.
[1:36:56] I'm going to provide for you every step
[1:36:57] of the way. I've dispatched angel armies
[1:37:00] and they're dropping you handfuls on
[1:37:02] purpose." On that day when you can't
[1:37:03] take another step. On that day when
[1:37:05] you're attacked on all sides, he says,
[1:37:06] "Make sure you got them. Make sure
[1:37:08] you're taking care of them. Make sure
[1:37:09] you're strengthening them today. That
[1:37:11] sister needs a little joy today. That
[1:37:12] sister right there needs lifting up.
[1:37:14] That brother needs a new job. That
[1:37:16] brother's car is messed up. Make sure it
[1:37:17] gets taken care of. Make sure that they
[1:37:19] get taken care of on their journey.
[1:37:23] He cares about us, church. He's not
[1:37:26] going to let this mission fail. It's his
[1:37:27] mission. The king said go back.
[1:37:31] It's his
[1:37:32] decree. When he sends you on a mission,
[1:37:35] he provides for you. So quit worrying
[1:37:37] about am I going to have enough or am I
[1:37:39] going to make it. This is the king's
[1:37:40] work. This is the king's edict.
[1:37:42] Everything you need is going to be
[1:37:45] supplied right on time. All according to
[1:37:48] the grant given by the king. He ain't
[1:37:51] going to run out. He was the cattle on a
[1:37:54] thousand hills. Oh, that's not enough.
[1:37:56] Well, let me create some more hills. Let
[1:37:58] me put some more cattle there. Oh, that
[1:38:00] ain't enough. Here's some more cows.
[1:38:01] Where'd those come from? I made them for
[1:38:03] you. I made a way through the Red Sea. I
[1:38:05] poured out mana in the wilderness. I was
[1:38:07] the brass serpent lifted up on the pole.
[1:38:09] Whatever you come up on, I got the
[1:38:12] answer for you.
[1:38:17] Even though others weren't going back,
[1:38:18] and even though the majority of people
[1:38:20] were staying in Babylon, there was a
[1:38:22] drive in these. We must rebuild
[1:38:25] Jerusalem. We must rebuild the city. We
[1:38:28] must rebuild the temple. We must rebuild
[1:38:30] the wall. There must be a restoration.
[1:38:32] And with edicts from the king, with
[1:38:34] everything they needed provided by the
[1:38:36] king, they returned and they began to
[1:38:38] rebuild. And and as they return to the
[1:38:40] original worship, and y'all seen
[1:38:43] this and as they return to the original
[1:38:47] faith, opposition begins to rise.
[1:38:51] Adversaries begin to rise.
[1:38:54] But what they knew was is that if they
[1:38:57] were going to return to the original
[1:38:58] worship and the original faith, it could
[1:38:59] not be mixed with other worship. It
[1:39:02] couldn't be mixed with the theology of
[1:39:04] man. It couldn't be polluted with
[1:39:06] Babylon. It had to be free from
[1:39:08] denomination.
[1:39:09] So if you'll look with me at Ezra 4
[1:39:12] and1, this worship has to be pure, the
[1:39:14] unadulterated word. And it says, "Now
[1:39:18] when the adversaries, key word in this,
[1:39:22] of Judah and Benjamin heard that the
[1:39:24] children of the captivity builded the
[1:39:25] temple under the Lord God of Israel.
[1:39:27] Then they came to Zerubabel and to the
[1:39:30] chief of the fathers, and said unto
[1:39:31] them, "Let us build with you. We want to
[1:39:34] help. Right. We want to be a part of
[1:39:37] this. Let us build with you. For we seek
[1:39:40] your God as as you do, and we do
[1:39:43] sacrifice unto him since the days of
[1:39:45] Esther Hadon, king of Assasser, which
[1:39:47] brought us up hither. This seems
[1:39:50] reasonable.
[1:39:52] But you got to go back to that very
[1:39:53] first verse. This was an adversary. Not
[1:39:56] a used to be adversary. This was an
[1:39:58] adversary.
[1:40:01] Think about Sure, Brother Brandon. will
[1:40:03] support you, but just hey, back off the
[1:40:04] women a little bit.
[1:40:07] Brother Brown, we'll support your
[1:40:08] meeting, but quit with all this serpent
[1:40:10] seed stuff. We'll offer a helping hand,
[1:40:13] but it would have to be mixed,
[1:40:17] have to be mixed. Just hey, don't don't
[1:40:19] say this so much. Now, restoration,
[1:40:21] rebuilding has to be pure, has to be
[1:40:24] unadulterated.
[1:40:26] The word adversary here means to oppress
[1:40:29] someone hard. So prior to the returning
[1:40:32] of the Jews from exile, this is the
[1:40:34] group of people that had been dominant
[1:40:36] in this area. They were the rulers of
[1:40:38] the people and and they resent losing
[1:40:40] power over the region and they don't
[1:40:42] want to lose their people. So they begin
[1:40:45] to say, "Don't go down there to that
[1:40:46] man. Don't go down there to that church.
[1:40:48] Don't worship like they worship. That's
[1:40:50] wrong. That's out of order. That's a You
[1:40:52] don't got to believe all that. You can
[1:40:53] stay right here in this church and
[1:40:54] everything will be fine." They don't
[1:40:56] want to lose power. So they begin to
[1:40:58] turn on it. Verse three says, ' But
[1:41:01] Zerubabel and Joshua, the rest of the
[1:41:04] chief of the fathers of Israel, said
[1:41:05] unto them, you have nothing to do with
[1:41:08] us to build a house to our God. But we
[1:41:11] ourselves together will build unto the
[1:41:12] Lord God of Israel, as the king Cyrus,
[1:41:15] the king of Persia, hath commanded us.
[1:41:18] Remember in all this, remember, why are
[1:41:19] we doing what we're doing? King told us
[1:41:21] to, king commissioned us to.
[1:41:24] If the Jewers, if the Jewish leaders had
[1:41:26] accepted their help, then the worship of
[1:41:28] Yahweh will be corrupted with the
[1:41:30] mixture of pagan practices and this
[1:41:33] return cannot be mixed.
[1:41:36] And when they find no compromise and
[1:41:38] they find that they're going to stay
[1:41:39] true to the king's edict, no matter what
[1:41:41] they do, they began trying to hinder the
[1:41:44] work. Verse four. Then the people of the
[1:41:47] land weakened the hands of the people of
[1:41:49] Judah and troubled them in building and
[1:41:53] hired counselors against them to
[1:41:54] frustrate their purpose. All the days of
[1:41:57] Cyrus, king of Persia, even until the
[1:42:00] reign of Darius, king of Persia, and in
[1:42:02] the reign of Ahazarus, in the beginning
[1:42:03] of his reign, wrote they unto him an
[1:42:07] accusation against the inhabitants of
[1:42:10] Judah and Jerusalem.
[1:42:12] One thing you're going to be sure of is
[1:42:14] you're going to face opposition
[1:42:16] and you're going to face accusations
[1:42:20] as you begin to restore the original
[1:42:24] all kinds of things. The enemy doesn't
[1:42:26] want to see you back in the homeland.
[1:42:28] They don't He doesn't want to deal with
[1:42:30] the power of God in the church again. He
[1:42:32] doesn't want to deal with a book of Acts
[1:42:34] church. He likes dealing with churches
[1:42:36] living below their privileges. So he
[1:42:39] tries to hinder you from getting back
[1:42:40] where you belong and and he don't want
[1:42:42] the people returned to where they need
[1:42:44] to be in order to receive the promise.
[1:42:47] And so he begins to raise opposition to
[1:42:49] the restoration and he tries to stop the
[1:42:52] work because he knows how to read. And
[1:42:55] he recognizes if I ever let these people
[1:42:57] recognize who they are, if I ever let
[1:42:59] them return to the book of Acts, if they
[1:43:01] ever get the true revelation of the true
[1:43:04] church and who she is, they will be an
[1:43:07] invincible army. I'd like to tell him
[1:43:09] this morning, too late. Too late. Too
[1:43:13] late. We recognize who we are. We've
[1:43:16] been turned back to the original. I know
[1:43:18] where I stand. I know the promises are
[1:43:20] true. We are that invincible army this
[1:43:23] morning.
[1:43:25] Hallelujah. He knows where you'll be
[1:43:28] blessed. It's in the homeland. He knows
[1:43:30] where you'll receive your promises. It's
[1:43:32] in the homeland. He knows where Israel
[1:43:35] had to be to receive a Messiah
[1:43:39] in the
[1:43:40] homeland. So he begins trying to stop
[1:43:42] it. He needs to get them stuck in
[1:43:44] Babylon. He needs them bound by
[1:43:46] tradition. He can't let Jerusalem be
[1:43:48] rebuilt. He can't have people turn back
[1:43:50] to the original faith. So, he fights and
[1:43:53] he discourages and he brings false
[1:43:55] accusations. You find the exact same
[1:43:57] thing over in Nehemiah when things are
[1:43:59] being brought back to what they once
[1:44:01] were. Those that don't want it
[1:44:04] returned will mock it.
[1:44:09] Those that don't want you to return will
[1:44:11] mock it. But Nehemiah is not worried
[1:44:13] about their threats. He's not worried
[1:44:16] about their accusations because he has
[1:44:18] an edict from the king.
[1:44:20] Rebuild,
[1:44:22] rebuild, rebuild. The wall must be rem
[1:44:26] rebuilt. And he actually carries letters
[1:44:28] from the king at all times to prove his
[1:44:31] authority to carry out the job. It don't
[1:44:34] matter what the critics say. It doesn't
[1:44:36] matter what those who chose not to
[1:44:38] return say. We're doing what we're doing
[1:44:40] because we have an edict from the king.
[1:44:43] He says, "I want my church the way she
[1:44:45] was. I want my church the way I started
[1:44:48] it. I want my church restored. I want
[1:44:50] prophecy in the church. I want visions
[1:44:52] in the church. I want gifts in the
[1:44:54] church. I want the fullness of the word
[1:44:56] in the church. I want the Holy Ghost in
[1:44:58] the church. I want altars in the church.
[1:45:00] I want lives changed in the church. I
[1:45:02] want deliverance in the church." And we
[1:45:03] just say, "Yes, Lord. Yes, Lord. Yes,
[1:45:05] Lord." And others are going, "Why you
[1:45:07] doing it? Why you doing it? Why you
[1:45:08] doing it?" Cuz God said, "Do it. I want
[1:45:11] to turn around. Why aren't you doing it?
[1:45:12] Why aren't you doing it? Why aren't you
[1:45:14] doing it? The king's edict said,
[1:45:16] "Rebuild it the way I started it."
[1:45:22] Why do you preach what you preach with
[1:45:23] such passion? The king told me to.
[1:45:27] He said, "Do it this way." That's right.
[1:45:34] We've got a message from the king to
[1:45:35] prove it.
[1:45:37] Prophet God says, "I will be found of
[1:45:39] you, sayaith the Lord, and I will turn
[1:45:41] away your captivity. I will gather you
[1:45:43] from all nations and from all the places
[1:45:45] where I've drove you, sayeth the Lord. I
[1:45:47] will bring you again under the place
[1:45:49] which I cause you to be carried away
[1:45:51] from captive." This is in desperation
[1:45:53] 63. After he says that, I'm going to
[1:45:56] read that sentence again. I will bring
[1:45:57] you again under the place which I caused
[1:45:59] you to be carried away captive back to
[1:46:02] Pentecost.
[1:46:04] He says they were very religious and so
[1:46:06] was the Pharisees. But Jesus said,
[1:46:08] "Except the man be born again, he will
[1:46:10] in no wise enter into the kingdom,
[1:46:12] you've got to go back to where we left
[1:46:13] him. Go back and find him for these
[1:46:16] creeds was not so in the beginning. The
[1:46:18] denominational churches was not so in
[1:46:20] the beginning. just drop everything and
[1:46:23] rush back to Pentecost and find the true
[1:46:26] and living God who heals the sick who
[1:46:29] cleanses the lepers, who cast out
[1:46:31] devils, who claims that he is the same
[1:46:33] yesterday, today, and forever. The king
[1:46:36] has decreed that we can have exactly
[1:46:38] what they had there in the upper room.
[1:46:40] The king has issued an edict. He said,
[1:46:41] "Rebuild the wall. Rebuild the temple.
[1:46:44] Get Jerusalem ready."
[1:46:46] And Ezra having turned down the help of
[1:46:48] the hybridized religion now he faces
[1:46:51] their attacks as they try to
[1:46:53] hinder and Cyrus is no longer on the
[1:46:56] throne and there's a new king ruling and
[1:47:00] they begin to write letters to this
[1:47:02] king and we're going to turn this
[1:47:04] towards home. We're running out of time.
[1:47:07] We're going to read almost a full
[1:47:08] chapter but I want you to watch the
[1:47:10] attack and how the attack turns against
[1:47:13] them. It's beautiful. Ezra
[1:47:17] 4:12. This is the letter from the people
[1:47:19] trying to stop the rebuilding. Be it
[1:47:23] known unto the king that the Jews which
[1:47:25] came up from thee to us are come unto
[1:47:28] Jerusalem, building the rebellious and
[1:47:31] the bad city, and have set up the walls
[1:47:35] thereof, and join the foundation. I read
[1:47:37] that and say, praise the Lord, they're
[1:47:38] making progress.
[1:47:41] Be it known now unto the king, that if
[1:47:43] this city be builded, and the walls set
[1:47:45] up again, then they will not pay toll,
[1:47:47] tribute, and custom, and so thou shalt
[1:47:50] end damage the revenue of the kings.
[1:47:52] Verse 15, they say, "Let there be a
[1:47:54] search, let a search may be made in the
[1:47:56] book of the records of thy fathers. So
[1:47:59] shalt thou find in the book of the
[1:48:00] records, and know that this is a
[1:48:02] rebellious city, and hurtful unto kings
[1:48:05] and provinces, and that they have moved
[1:48:08] sedition within the same of old time.
[1:48:10] For which cause was this city
[1:48:13] destroyed? They tell the king, "If you
[1:48:15] let this go on, they're going to be
[1:48:16] troubled. They are rebellious. Look in
[1:48:19] the records and see if they weren't once
[1:48:21] rebellious. Look in the records, Lord.
[1:48:24] Look in the records and see if these
[1:48:25] people weren't once sinners.
[1:48:28] Look in the records and see if these
[1:48:30] people wasn't rebellious. Look in the
[1:48:32] records and see if they wasn't stubborn
[1:48:34] and stiff necked and if they didn't fail
[1:48:36] time after time after time. Look in the
[1:48:39] records. Look at their past and now
[1:48:42] they're claiming to be free. They're
[1:48:44] claiming to be filled with the Holy
[1:48:45] Ghost. Lord, why won't you go back and
[1:48:48] look in the records? Search it out. Who
[1:48:50] are they to rebuild anything?
[1:48:53] Who are they to do anything from the
[1:48:55] Lord? This is the same church that fell
[1:48:58] away. And actually, for a time, these
[1:49:01] letters caused the work to cease. All
[1:49:04] the things they said were true.
[1:49:11] They were facts. And I like to look at
[1:49:14] it like this. There's a lot of facts I
[1:49:16] could say about you that wouldn't make
[1:49:17] you look real good.
[1:49:20] There's a lot of facts you could say
[1:49:22] about me. Fact is, I was lost. Fact is,
[1:49:25] I was a sinner. Fact is, I had fallen
[1:49:27] away from God. Fact is, I wasn't worth
[1:49:29] anything. I was a repbate. I was no
[1:49:32] good. I was going to hell. Those were
[1:49:34] all facts. And I can't argue with the
[1:49:36] facts. But the facts don't change the
[1:49:38] truth. Truth is, I was a son of God.
[1:49:40] Truth is, he died to save my soul. Truth
[1:49:42] is, I'm going to go to a body change.
[1:49:43] Truth is, I'm taking a rapture. Truth is
[1:49:46] that it don't matter this is the church
[1:49:48] that fell. It don't matter that you were
[1:49:50] a sinner. There's been an edict from the
[1:49:52] king. The truth is, he says, "You're
[1:49:54] going to make it. You're going back.
[1:49:56] You're a child of God. You can have the
[1:49:59] Holy Ghost." Devil says, "What about the
[1:50:00] facts? What about the facts? What about
[1:50:02] the facts?" And God says, "It's about
[1:50:04] the truth." And the truth is, I gave my
[1:50:08] life to do away with your facts.
[1:50:13] Hallelujah.
[1:50:15] [Applause]
[1:50:17] King said
[1:50:19] restore and you can have whatever you
[1:50:21] need to finish the
[1:50:23] job. Ezra 5
[1:50:25] and1. Then the prophets
[1:50:28] Hagi the prophet and Zechariah the son
[1:50:32] of Edido prophesied unto the Jews that
[1:50:36] were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name
[1:50:37] of God of Israel even unto them. Then
[1:50:39] rose up Zerubel the son of Chhatiel and
[1:50:42] Joshua the son of Josec and began to
[1:50:45] build the house of God which is at
[1:50:46] Jerusalem. And with them were the
[1:50:48] prophets of God helping them.
[1:50:52] In response to everything the enemy had
[1:50:55] did to keep us bound. God said, "Let me
[1:50:58] send him a prophet. Let me send a
[1:51:00] prophet." Because it says the prophets
[1:51:01] were there helping them, looking to the
[1:51:03] message. They just keep on building. We
[1:51:05] didn't return here for nothing. We
[1:51:07] hadn't come back to this place for
[1:51:09] nothing, church. We didn't come back
[1:51:11] here to worship how they worshiped in
[1:51:13] Babylon. We didn't come back here so we
[1:51:15] could do things like they did it in the
[1:51:17] denominations. It doesn't matter what
[1:51:18] anybody else says. I didn't leave there
[1:51:20] to act like there. I didn't come out of
[1:51:22] that to worship like that. I didn't come
[1:51:24] out of that to live like that. I came
[1:51:26] out to be like the ones at the original.
[1:51:29] I came out to be free. I came out to
[1:51:31] rise above the critics. I came out to
[1:51:33] soar like an eagle. I came back to
[1:51:35] rebuild and restore the original
[1:51:38] worship.
[1:51:40] Hallelujah.
[1:51:41] Verse three. And at the same time came
[1:51:44] to them Tatana the governor on this side
[1:51:46] of the
[1:51:47] river and Sha Barzai and their
[1:51:50] companions and said unto them, "Who hath
[1:51:52] commanded you to build this house and to
[1:51:54] make up this wall?" And once again, they
[1:51:57] write a letter to the
[1:51:59] king. And I may skip some of this. Just
[1:52:02] bear with me. But be it known unto the
[1:52:04] king, that we went into the province of
[1:52:05] Judea, to the house of the great God,
[1:52:08] which is builded with great stones and
[1:52:10] timber laid in the walls, and this work
[1:52:12] goeth fast on and prosperth in their
[1:52:15] hands. And we asked him and said unto
[1:52:18] them, who commanded you to build this
[1:52:20] house, and to make these walls? We asked
[1:52:22] their names to certify thee, that we may
[1:52:24] write their names of the men that were
[1:52:26] the chief of them. And thus they
[1:52:28] returned their answer to us, saying, "We
[1:52:29] are the servants of the God of heaven
[1:52:31] and earth, and build the house that was
[1:52:33] builded these many years ago, which a
[1:52:35] great king of Israel built and set up."
[1:52:38] But after that our fathers had provoked
[1:52:40] the God of heaven under wrath, and he
[1:52:41] gave them into the hand of
[1:52:42] Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, who
[1:52:45] destroyed this house and carried the
[1:52:46] people away into Babylon. But in the
[1:52:49] first year of Cyrus, the king of
[1:52:50] Babylon, the same king Cyrus, made a
[1:52:52] decree to build this house of God.
[1:52:56] And he goes through everything that
[1:52:58] Cyrus had told him to do and how they
[1:53:00] could have everything restored and how
[1:53:01] they could take the vessels and take
[1:53:03] them to the temple. And then verse 16,
[1:53:05] then came the same bizarre and laid the
[1:53:07] foundation of the house of God which is
[1:53:09] in Jerusalem. And since that time even
[1:53:11] until now hath it been building and yet
[1:53:14] it is not finished. Now therefore, now
[1:53:17] this is the people that are accusing
[1:53:18] you.
[1:53:20] Here we are. This is them. Now
[1:53:21] therefore, if it seemed good to the
[1:53:24] king, let there be a search made in the
[1:53:27] king's treasure house, which is there at
[1:53:29] Babylon, whether it be so that a decree
[1:53:32] was made of Cyrus the king, to build
[1:53:35] this house of God at Jerusalem, and let
[1:53:37] the king send his pleasure to us
[1:53:39] concerning this matter. They're
[1:53:41] thinking, "Oh, we got them now. Search
[1:53:44] the records, king. They're claiming
[1:53:46] this. They're claiming they have a right
[1:53:48] to the Holy Ghost. They're claiming they
[1:53:50] have a right to their children. They're
[1:53:52] claiming they have a right to worship
[1:53:54] freely. Search the records, king, and
[1:53:56] let us know what you think. Ezra 6 verse
[1:54:00] one. Maybe my favorite chapter. Amen.
[1:54:04] Then Darius the king made a decree and
[1:54:07] search was made in the house of the
[1:54:09] roles where the treasures were laid up
[1:54:11] in Babylon. And there was found at
[1:54:13] Akmatha in the palace that is in the
[1:54:15] province of the Mes a role and therein
[1:54:18] was a record thus written. In the first
[1:54:20] year of Cyrus the king, the same Cyrus
[1:54:23] the king made a decree concerning the
[1:54:24] house of God at Jerusalem. Let the house
[1:54:27] be builded, the place where they offer
[1:54:30] sacrifices, and let the foundations
[1:54:32] thereof be strongly laid, the height
[1:54:34] thereof three score cubits, and the
[1:54:36] breadth thereof three score cubits, with
[1:54:38] three rows of great stones, and a row of
[1:54:40] new timber. and let the expenses be
[1:54:42] given out of the king's house, and also
[1:54:45] let the gold and the silver vessels of
[1:54:47] God, which Nebuchadnezzar took forth out
[1:54:49] of the temple, which is at Jerusalem,
[1:54:50] and brought unto Babylon, be restored,
[1:54:53] and brought again unto the temple, which
[1:54:54] is at Jerusalem, everyone to his place,
[1:54:58] and placed them in the house of God. Now
[1:55:00] therefore, Tatana, governor beyond the
[1:55:02] river, he's speaking to the guy that
[1:55:04] wrote the letter now. Thou therefore
[1:55:06] governor beyond the river, Sheth
[1:55:08] Bersini, and companions of the arpe
[1:55:11] arpeacites which are beyond the river,
[1:55:13] be ye far from thin. Let the work of
[1:55:17] this house of God alone. Let the
[1:55:19] governor of the Jews and the elders of
[1:55:21] the Jews build this house for God in
[1:55:23] this place. Moreover, I make a decree
[1:55:25] that you shall do to the elders of these
[1:55:27] Jews for the building of the house of
[1:55:28] God, that of the king's goods, even of
[1:55:31] the tribute beyond the river, forth with
[1:55:33] expenses be given unto the men, that
[1:55:35] they be not hindered, and that which
[1:55:38] they have need of, both young bullocks,
[1:55:40] and rams, and lambs for burnt offerings,
[1:55:43] and of the God of heaven, wheat, salt,
[1:55:45] wine, and oil, according to the
[1:55:47] appointment of the priests which are at
[1:55:48] Jerusalem. Let it be given to them day
[1:55:51] by day without fail that they may offer
[1:55:56] sacrifices of sweet savor unto the God
[1:55:59] of heaven and pray for the life of the
[1:56:01] king and of his sons. I have made a
[1:56:04] decree that whosoever shall alter this
[1:56:06] word, let timber be pulled down from his
[1:56:09] house be set up, let him be hanged
[1:56:11] thereon, and let his house be made a
[1:56:13] dung hill for this. And the God that
[1:56:16] hath caused his name to dwell there
[1:56:18] destroy all kings and people that shall
[1:56:20] put their hand to alter and to destroy
[1:56:23] this house of God which is at Jerusalem.
[1:56:25] I Darius have made a decree. Let it be
[1:56:29] done with speed.
[1:56:32] Hallelujah.
[1:56:35] Hallelujah.
[1:56:37] Hallelujah. You want to stop this
[1:56:39] restoration. You want to stop this
[1:56:42] worship. You want to stop the
[1:56:44] restoration of the bride, then let's
[1:56:46] take it up with the king and see if
[1:56:48] there was an edict or a scripture about
[1:56:50] this. Oh, stay with me just a second.
[1:56:53] Oh, you shouldn't be dancing in church
[1:56:55] who gave you a right to do that. I say,
[1:56:58] "Let there be a church made." Psalms 49
[1:57:01] and1. Praise the Lord. Sing unto the
[1:57:03] Lord a new song and his praises in the
[1:57:06] congregation of saints. Let Israel
[1:57:08] rejoice in him that made Let the
[1:57:10] children of Zion be joyful in their
[1:57:12] king. Let them praise his name in the
[1:57:17] dance. Let them sing praises unto him
[1:57:20] with a temple in a heart. Oh, the king
[1:57:24] said it.
[1:57:28] Hallelujah. Psalms 150 and1. Praise ye
[1:57:31] the Lord. Praise God in his sanctuary.
[1:57:33] Praise him in the firmament of his
[1:57:35] power. Praise him for his mighty acts.
[1:57:37] Praise him according to his excellent
[1:57:39] greatness. Praise him with the sound of
[1:57:41] the trumpet. Praise him with the sultry
[1:57:43] in heart. Praise him with the temporal
[1:57:45] and the
[1:57:47] Oh, the Bible didn't say you can if you
[1:57:49] want to. That tells you to praise him in
[1:57:52] the dance. I don't care what they say.
[1:57:56] Oh, well, we aren't Pentecostals. No
[1:57:59] need for all this tongues and dreams and
[1:58:02] gifts. I say, "Let there be a search
[1:58:05] made." Joel 2:28, "And it shall come to
[1:58:08] pass afterward that I will pour out my
[1:58:10] spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and
[1:58:13] your daughters shall prophesy, and your
[1:58:16] old men shall dream dreams, your young
[1:58:18] men shall see."
[1:58:21] The king decreed you can have it. Mark
[1:58:26] 16:17, "And these signs shall follow
[1:58:28] them that believe. In my name shall they
[1:58:30] cast out devils and they shall speak
[1:58:32] with
[1:58:35] You mean we're not just a bunch of
[1:58:36] emotional
[1:58:37] Pentecostals? The king said, "Go back
[1:58:41] and I want you to praise me in the
[1:58:42] dance. I want there to be visions. I
[1:58:44] want there to be dreams. I want there to
[1:58:46] be tongues. I want it rebuilt exactly
[1:58:49] how it was at the beginning."
[1:58:53] What about shouting? Oh, that's out of
[1:58:56] order. Well, Psalms 32:11 says, "Be glad
[1:58:58] in the Lord. Rejoice, ye righteous, and
[1:59:01] shout for joy, all ye that are upright
[1:59:04] in heart." I say,
[1:59:06] "Glory,
[1:59:08] glory,
[1:59:10] hallelujah. Blessed be the name of the
[1:59:13] Lord."
[1:59:15] Hallelujah. Psalms 35:27, "Let them
[1:59:19] shout for joy and be glad that favor my
[1:59:23] righteous cause. Yay. Let them say
[1:59:25] continually, "Let the Lord be magnified,
[1:59:28] which hath pleasure in the prosperity of
[1:59:30] his servants."
[1:59:33] What about the Holy Ghost? Search it.
[1:59:35] Acts 2:38. And the promises unto you and
[1:59:38] to your children, to as many as the Lord
[1:59:41] God shall call, even them that are far
[1:59:44] off. That was me. I grabbed hold of that
[1:59:47] part and said, "Thank you, Jesus." The
[1:59:49] king said, "I can have it." It's time we
[1:59:52] quit arguing and just search the
[1:59:54] records.
[1:59:57] Just look at what he gave you. You're
[2:00:00] not going to rapture. According to the
[2:00:02] king's edict, I'm going to make it. I'm
[2:00:06] going to rapture. Not just me, but my
[2:00:09] family with me.
[2:00:15] Hallelujah. It's time we get our harp
[2:00:17] off the willow tree.
[2:00:20] I'mma skip some things. All of
[2:00:24] it. But I got to get to this. So, I'mma
[2:00:27] wing
[2:00:30] it. And I need to breathe for a
[2:00:34] minute. Y'all just stay up. If you sit
[2:00:37] back down, we'll be here a while cuz
[2:00:39] I'll go open my iPad back up. Stay with
[2:00:42] me. Why the drive? Why do they have to
[2:00:45] go back?
[2:00:49] because there was a promised Messiah
[2:00:52] that was going to come to Jerusalem
[2:00:55] and they couldn't receive him or they
[2:00:58] would miss him in Babylon.
[2:01:01] The temple had to be rebuilt because it
[2:01:04] was prophesied that he would be in the
[2:01:06] temple.
[2:01:08] It had to be rebuilt. That's why they
[2:01:10] were driven to the fulfillment.
[2:01:13] And and so they're drawn back. There's
[2:01:15] scripture after scripture that says he's
[2:01:16] coming there.
[2:01:18] So there had to exist.
[2:01:22] And so they go back and they build and
[2:01:24] they build. And I'm sorry we don't have
[2:01:25] time to go through it all,
[2:01:26] but when they get done with it, brother
[2:01:29] Andrew, they wept
[2:01:32] because it wasn't good enough.
[2:01:35] And they begin to compare it to
[2:01:37] Solomon's temple.
[2:01:40] And they said, "It don't have the gold
[2:01:41] and silver. It don't have the urine in
[2:01:43] my thumb and it don't have the ark of
[2:01:45] the covenant. It don't have the pillar
[2:01:47] of fire. It's not good enough. Then the
[2:01:50] word of the Lord comes to him and go,
[2:01:52] "Don't worry about the silver and the
[2:01:53] gold. That was all mine anyway. I own it
[2:01:57] all." He says, "What's going to make the
[2:01:59] crowning of this temple is that the
[2:02:03] Messiah is going to walk into it. The
[2:02:06] Messiah is going to walk through it. And
[2:02:08] it's going to be his presence daily in
[2:02:10] the temple that is the crowning jewel
[2:02:12] that makes it far exceed the beauty of
[2:02:15] the original. And now after ages and
[2:02:18] ages and ages, we've worked and we've
[2:02:20] worked and messages have gone out and
[2:02:22] messages have gone out behind this pull
[2:02:24] pit around the world. Messages and we've
[2:02:26] strove and we've dedicated. And
[2:02:28] sometimes we look at it and we go, "This
[2:02:31] is all we could
[2:02:34] do. This is all we've produced.
[2:02:38] this is it. And God says, "Don't worry
[2:02:42] about it." But but God, look at that
[2:02:44] apostolic age. Look how rugged they
[2:02:46] were. Look at the book of Acts. We We
[2:02:48] don't compare. We We don't measure up. I
[2:02:50] read that. He goes, "No, no, no. Your
[2:02:53] crowning joy is going to be that I'm
[2:02:55] going to come down and I'm going to
[2:02:58] receive you and it's going to be my
[2:02:59] presence in you that gives this glory
[2:03:02] greater than the formal glory." What is
[2:03:05] our crowning achievement? He's coming
[2:03:07] back for you. He's coming back to
[2:03:10] Jerusalem. You said it before I came
[2:03:12] out. What is it? Jerusalem had to be
[2:03:14] rebuilt. New Jerusalem. The bride's wife
[2:03:18] had to be the bride lamb's wife had to
[2:03:20] be rebuilt. You are the new Jerusalem. A
[2:03:24] city. Hallelujah. Had to be restored.
[2:03:27] Why? Why? He wasn't coming to Babylon.
[2:03:31] He was coming to New Jerusalem.
[2:03:34] We have returned to receive our
[2:03:37] bridegroom.
[2:03:39] Why am I here? Because he said, "This is
[2:03:42] where he's coming." And I got to be
[2:03:45] ready. The city's got to be built. The
[2:03:48] hearts have got to be returned. We've
[2:03:50] turned back. We've returned to receive
[2:03:55] the coming Messiah.
[2:03:58] May God bless you today.
[2:04:06] [Music]
[2:04:18] Hallelujah. Maybe you just want to lift
[2:04:20] your hands and say, "Thank you, Lord
[2:04:22] Jesus.
[2:04:24] Thank you, Lord Jesus, for turning our
[2:04:26] hearts back." you are. Maybe you just
[2:04:29] want to talk to the Lord right there
[2:04:30] where you are and just worship him out
[2:04:33] of your heart just now. Father, we love
[2:04:36] you so much. You have blessed us
[2:04:39] abundantly, Lord Jesus. We have heard
[2:04:42] the king's decree. You have blessed us
[2:04:44] and turned our hearts, Lord Jesus, to
[2:04:47] come back to the message. It has turned
[2:04:50] us to see that it's not just a building.
[2:04:53] It's not just a church, but it's you
[2:04:56] that is there at the sanctuary, the very
[2:04:58] heart of it, Lord Jesus. And we want to
[2:05:01] make you king in our hearts, king in our
[2:05:04] worship, king in our home. We want you
[2:05:07] to reign supreme in this place, oh God.
[2:05:11] Make us to be exactly what you built us
[2:05:13] to be. No matter what anybody else says,
[2:05:16] no matter what anybody else decrees, we
[2:05:19] will come back to what the king has
[2:05:21] spoken himself. Father, we turn our
[2:05:25] hearts back to a heart of worship, back
[2:05:28] to babble days again, back to miracles,
[2:05:31] back to those things that we saw. Oh
[2:05:34] God, we give you praise and honor and
[2:05:36] glory for all that you have done. and
[2:05:40] make us not be afraid
[2:05:42] of the snare or the fowler. Oh God, for
[2:05:46] we give you praise in this place in the
[2:05:49] name of Jesus Christ. Won't you just
[2:05:52] lift your voice to him and thank him for
[2:05:55] breaking your traditions.
[2:06:00] Won't you lift your voice and thank him
[2:06:01] for breaking your
[2:06:03] pride? Would you lift your voice and
[2:06:05] say, "Thank you, Lord Jesus, for
[2:06:08] breaking my wicked ways
[2:06:10] of Lelaya that wanted me to get
[2:06:12] comfortable where I was, but I want to
[2:06:15] run with everything within me. And I
[2:06:17] want to return to a full promise." And I
[2:06:20] say if you haven't received the full
[2:06:22] promise of the Holy Ghost, I say it's
[2:06:24] here for you right now in this place. I
[2:06:27] say if you haven't received your liberty
[2:06:29] to worship, I'd say it's in this place.
[2:06:31] I'd say if you ain't had if you ain't
[2:06:33] had a renewing of the Holy Ghost, I say
[2:06:35] it's in this place.
[2:06:38] I say it's Bible
[2:06:41] days. Hallelujah.
[2:06:45] [Music]
[2:06:50] Gal. I'm going all the
[2:06:55] way. Oh,
[2:06:57] all the way.
[2:07:01] I'm going all the

[2:07:14] way. I'm going all the way with my
[2:07:22] Lord. I

[2:07:37] choice. I'm going all the
[2:07:41] way. I've
[2:07:44] made my
[2:07:46] choice. I'm going all the way.
[2:07:52] I'm going all the way with my
[2:07:59] Lord. I made my
[2:08:05] decision. I'm going all the
[2:08:09] way. I made my
[2:08:14] decision. I'm going all the way.
[2:08:20] I made my
[2:08:24] decision. I'm going all the
[2:08:28] way. I'm going all the way with my
[2:08:37] Lord. No
[2:08:40] turn me
[2:08:42] back. I'm going all the way.
[2:08:48] No
[2:08:49] turn me
[2:08:52] back. I'm going all the
[2:08:56] way. No
[2:08:58] turn me back. I'm going all the
[2:09:06] way. I'm going all the way with my Lord.
[2:09:14] [Music]
[2:09:20] I I'm going all the
[2:09:24] way. Don't
[2:09:26] turn me
[2:09:29] back. I'm going all the
[2:09:33] way. I'm
[2:09:36] drawn the
[2:09:39] line. I'm going all the way.
[2:09:44] I'm going all the way with my Lord.
[2:09:50] Well, my
[2:09:51] mind where my
[2:09:54] mind is made
[2:09:57] of. I'm going all the way. Yes. So
[2:10:04] turning
[2:10:06] back. I'm going all the way.
[2:10:12] My mind is made
[2:10:16] up. I'm going all the
[2:10:20] way. I'm going all the way with the
[2:10:27] [Music]
[2:10:29] Lord. Oh, I won't go back. I can't go
[2:10:35] back to the way it used to be before
[2:10:42] your presence came and changed me.
[2:10:48] Oh, I won't go back. I can't go back to
[2:10:56] the way it used to be before your
[2:11:01] presence came and changed
[2:11:06] me. All my

[2:14:37] today. Come on. You're going to realize
[2:14:39] it. I've been

[2:15:32] [Applause]
[2:15:33] [Music]
[2:15:38] before your presence came and changed
[2:15:45] me. I wonder if you could have a little
[2:15:47] testimony service right there.
[2:15:50] Little testimony service right there
[2:15:52] where you are.
[2:15:56] Come on. You going to catch what I'm
[2:15:58] talking about. If you're going to
[2:16:00] testify, you got to tell somebody about
[2:16:03] it. Go ahead and have a testimony
[2:16:06] service. Go ahead, tell
[2:16:10] somebody. I have
[2:16:12] returned to receive my
[2:16:15] inheritance. It wasn't just for William
[2:16:17] Brandon. It wasn't just for the
[2:16:19] preachers, but I made my return.
[2:16:23] Now, what I'm trying to tell you to do
[2:16:25] is turn to somebody said, "I made my
[2:16:27] return. I'm
[2:16:29] changed. I'm healed." Go ahead and have
[2:16:32] a testimony service right there. You can
[2:16:35] celebrate with a guy right beside you
[2:16:37] and a sister right beside you. Say,
[2:16:39] "Hey, you know what? I'm
[2:16:42] happy. I'm
[2:16:44] happy. I went through some seasons when
[2:16:47] I was in a bad spot, but now I'm happy.
[2:16:51] [Music]
[2:16:54] Come on, Sister Christina. I went
[2:16:56] through some seasons of doubt, but now I
[2:16:59] got faith. I went through some seasons
[2:17:02] of sickness, but now I got healing. I
[2:17:05] went through some seasons when I barely
[2:17:08] could make it, but I'm in a season of
[2:17:10] prosperity. Go ahead and testify.
[2:17:13] Testify to the atmosphere. Testify to
[2:17:16] God. Testify to the neighbor. Can I get
[2:17:20] a witness in this place? That God still
[2:17:23] heals?
[2:17:25] That God still deliverance that cancer
[2:17:28] ain't big
[2:17:29] [Applause]
[2:17:31] enough? Cancer ain't Can anybody witness
[2:17:34] to that? Can anybody witness that fear
[2:17:37] ain't strong enough? Depression ain't
[2:17:39] big
[2:17:40] [Music]
[2:17:42] enough. Come on, somebody. Darkness
[2:17:44] ain't strong enough. Fear ain't great
[2:17:47] enough. complexes don't have
[2:17:51] enough. I have returned to my true self,
[2:17:55] a son of God, a daughter of
[2:17:58] God. I was born to
[2:18:02] worship. I was born to
[2:18:06] praise. The king's in this
[2:18:09] place and the king says, "It's all
[2:18:13] yours. It's all yours.
[2:18:17] I want you to run to the king for a
[2:18:19] moment. I want you to run to the king
[2:18:21] and say, "Thank you."
[2:18:23] And thank you. Thank you. I'm not going
[2:18:27] to be ashamed of my worship. I'm not
[2:18:29] going to be ashamed to play. I'm not
[2:18:31] going to be ashamed to dance. I'm not
[2:18:33] going to be ashamed to speak in tongues.
[2:18:35] I'm not going to be ashamed to clarify
[2:18:38] and to bless the name of Jesus.
[2:18:41] What I got to be ashamed about
[2:18:45] [Music]
[2:18:46] What I got to be ashamed of how the king
[2:18:49] told me the king sword is
[2:18:51] here. The king has made it for
[2:18:55] [Applause]
[2:18:57] me. You got every reason to shout. The
[2:19:00] king said you could. You got every
[2:19:03] reason to thank God for healing before
[2:19:05] it comes. The king said it could happen.
[2:19:09] [Applause]
[2:19:12] [Music]
[2:19:15] The king gave it to me.
[2:19:18] Who's going to take anything away from
[2:19:19] this king? I want to know who's got a
[2:19:22] strong enough hand to take my liberty
[2:19:25] away from the King of Kings. Who's got a
[2:19:28] strong enough hand to take my power?
[2:19:32] Name that devil.
[2:19:34] Name that devil. Name that intellectual
[2:19:37] giant that tries to tell you that you
[2:19:40] can't have it.
[2:19:41] Ask him if he's strong enough to take it
[2:19:43] away from King Jesus. And I'll tell you
[2:19:46] the answer. He's not strong
[2:19:51] enough. He's got healing in his hands.
[2:19:54] He's got power and deliverance and
[2:19:56] freedom. And I
[2:19:59] rejoice that everything I have need of
[2:20:01] is in the
[2:20:04] kingdom. Go
[2:20:07] ahead. This is a meeting.
[2:20:10] This is the meeting. Go ahead, enjoy
[2:20:13] your worship just for a
[2:20:15] [Applause]
[2:20:15] [Music]
[2:20:17] moment. Let everything the half
[2:20:23] breath. Now check your neighbor's pulse.
[2:20:26] If they ain't worshiping God, let's call
[2:20:28] Tiger's Junior home. Let's bring them up
[2:20:31] here. If they ain't praising
[2:20:34] [Music]
[2:20:35] God, then they're dead. And if you're
[2:20:38] dead, you got every right not to praise
[2:20:41] God. But the grave can't praise him. But
[2:20:44] the living can praise
[2:20:46] [Applause]
[2:20:50] him. I wonder if anybody got anything in
[2:20:53] here they want to worship God for. Maybe
[2:20:56] in your future, maybe you can worship
[2:20:58] God from your past, but what about right
[2:21:01] now? Can you find something in almighty
[2:21:05] God that's worth worshiping
[2:21:09] for? You say, "He ain't never done
[2:21:12] nothing for me." You still got to praise
[2:21:14] him.
[2:21:16] You still got to praise. If you never
[2:21:18] seen him at all, you still got to praise
[2:21:21] him. You are without excuse.
[2:21:24] [Music]
[2:21:33] [Applause]
[2:21:36] Hallelujah.
[2:21:37] Hallelujah.
[2:21:40] [Applause]
[2:21:42] [Music]
[2:21:48] Hallelujah.
[2:21:50] Glory.
[2:21:54] Glory. Let me have key G. I don't know
[2:21:57] if I mean G.
[2:21:58] Forgive me,
[2:22:01] G. Man, you got to preaching today,
[2:22:03] brother Aaron. My goodness. That's the
[2:22:06] greatest road
[2:22:08] map of why we're here that I've
[2:22:11] witnessed. That was wonderful.
[2:22:13] Wonderful, buddy.
[2:22:16] Wow. Back to the original. So, if you
[2:22:18] don't like the
[2:22:20] original, you're probably not going to
[2:22:22] like me.
[2:22:24] [Music]
[2:22:25] If you don't like Peter, you're probably
[2:22:27] not going to like me. If you don't like
[2:22:29] David, you're probably not going to like
[2:22:30] me. If you don't like Paul, you're
[2:22:31] probably not going to like me because
[2:22:33] I'm going to be what Paul was. I'm going
[2:22:35] to be what Peter was. I'm going to be
[2:22:36] what Isaiah was. I'm going to be what
[2:22:38] David was. I want to be so close to the
[2:22:41] pattern that you'll look at me and say,
[2:22:43] "I see Paul. I I see Peter. I see James.
[2:22:46] I see John. I see Jesus. I want to be
[2:22:49] that close that people mistake me for
[2:22:51] Jesus.

[2:22:57] of that. I'm going on with Jesus just

[2:24:42] smile. Well, I'm going over my Jesus

[2:33:21] is worthy of my
[2:33:25] praise. Oh my heart will sing. How
[2:33:31] great is our
[2:33:34] God. Yes, he's the name
[2:33:37] above all
[2:33:40] names. He is worthy of my praise.

[2:33:57] Hallelujah. Yes, he's the name
[2:34:00] above all
[2:34:03] names. He is worthy of my
[2:34:08] praise. Oh my heart.
[2:34:12] [Music]
[2:34:21] [Music]
[2:34:29] I can remember a prophet talking about a
[2:34:31] lady dealing with a certain
[2:34:33] situation and while she lifted up her
[2:34:36] hand, the pillar of fire went high and
[2:34:38] healed her body. You may not understand
[2:34:40] why you raised your hand just then. But
[2:34:43] let me tell you, the reason why you're
[2:34:45] raising your hand is not because some
[2:34:48] man told you to do it. It's not because
[2:34:50] you watched it on some TV screen or you
[2:34:53] watch it's something on the inside of
[2:34:55] you that has taken you higher. And when
[2:34:58] you lifted up your hand, the masterpiece
[2:35:01] by your
[2:35:03] way. I'd say while you were worshiping,
[2:35:06] something
[2:35:07] changed in the cells of your
[2:35:10] body. I'd say some of you were
[2:35:13] healed. I'd say some of you were
[2:35:18] filled. You notice the
[2:35:21] difference because you
[2:35:25] decided he's worthy.
[2:35:29] Some of you are tired of fighting the
[2:35:31] same
[2:35:32] situations that you've been fighting.
[2:35:34] So, you lifted up your hands, said, "I
[2:35:36] need a God like
[2:35:38] that." Some of you are tired of losing
[2:35:41] battles and you're ready to win, and you
[2:35:42] lifted up your hands. Some of you are
[2:35:45] ready for your family to be completely
[2:35:47] restored, so you lifted up your hands.
[2:35:50] You know why you lifted up your hands,
[2:35:52] and that's why he's come down to you,
[2:35:54] because he cares for your situation.
[2:36:00] He loves you.
[2:36:06] Just talk to him there just for a
[2:36:07] minute. Just give him thanksgiving from
[2:36:10] your
[2:36:11] heart. Just give him thanksgiving.
[2:36:13] [Music]
[2:36:22] [Music]
[2:36:23] Our
[2:36:24] God. Sing with me how brave.
[2:36:32] [Music]
[2:36:38] I see him as great. But how do you see
[2:36:41] him? How
[2:36:43] great is our
[2:36:46] God? Sing with me. How
[2:36:50] great is our
[2:36:52] God. And all will see how
[2:36:57] great, how
[2:36:59] great is our
[2:37:03] God. How
[2:37:04] [Music]
[2:37:08] great. Sing with me. How great.
[2:37:14] [Music]
[2:37:26] Too many
[2:37:27] times people bring a measuring tape to
[2:37:31] church and they measure out their the
[2:37:35] qualifications of how the service has
[2:37:37] got to be.
[2:37:38] in and there's a lot of people that have
[2:37:40] expectations
[2:37:42] and but just didn't get there in their
[2:37:45] expectation, but God got it exactly
[2:37:47] where I'd say it's time you put away
[2:37:49] your measuring tape.
[2:37:51] Let God do what he's going to do.
[2:37:55] There's some people that just they want
[2:37:57] to measure it out how it's got to be,
[2:37:59] the length of the sermon and all those
[2:38:01] things and how the miracle's got to
[2:38:03] come.
[2:38:04] The preacher's got to come and lay his
[2:38:06] hands on me. And I believe God can do
[2:38:08] that. But I got full faith in your
[2:38:12] power that the omnipotent power of
[2:38:15] almighty God lives on the inside of you.
[2:38:17] And all of a sudden, you can call for
[2:38:20] Lazarus to come forth. You can call for
[2:38:23] dry bones to come alive. You can call
[2:38:25] for healing right there. I got full
[2:38:27] confidence in brothers and sisters
[2:38:29] sitting right there across from you. Put
[2:38:31] away your measuring tape and let God
[2:38:32] have his way.
[2:38:34] in your
[2:38:36] life. My
[2:38:38] [Music]
[2:38:39] goodness. What a
[2:38:42] meeting. We going to
[2:38:46] remain because we return to receive
[2:38:49] it. Brother Aaron, God bless you
[2:38:51] abundantly, my
[2:38:54] friend. Hallelujah.
[2:39:00] [Music]
[2:39:14] God bless our brother
[2:39:16] Aaron. God bless you sister Lydia.
[2:39:20] I bless you the Ogalsby family. I know
[2:39:23] the sacrifice of a
[2:39:25] [Music]
[2:39:27] ministry. God bless
[2:39:30] [Music]
[2:39:38] you. My Lord Jesus is so good to us,
[2:39:41] isn't he?
[2:39:43] I don't know what else to say, but can
[2:39:46] we just give him thanks today?
[2:39:49] [Music]
[2:39:55] I'm thankful for men that are not a
[2:39:58] scared of the Holy
[2:40:00] Ghost. I'm thankful for men that want a
[2:40:05] restoration. I'm thankful for men that
[2:40:07] see the message as what it
[2:40:11] is. So, we say thank you.
[2:40:15] You have a great
[2:40:16] pastor, but your ministry is your
[2:40:20] ministry that God give you. No man give
[2:40:22] you that. That was the Holy Ghost that
[2:40:26] anointed you for the challenge of the
[2:40:28] hour because there would be men that
[2:40:30] would not raise up and preach the
[2:40:31] message in its fullness. But he knew
[2:40:32] that Aaron Og was be would be a man of
[2:40:35] God that would preach the message.
[2:40:39] That's the kind that God
[2:40:44] calls. And Full Gospel Lighthouse, we
[2:40:46] have been blessed, haven't
[2:40:49] we? You want to appreciate Brother Aaron
[2:40:52] just for a minute? Appreciate his
[2:40:55] ministry. God bless you, my
[2:40:58] [Music]
[2:41:01] friend.
[2:41:04] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:41:07] Won't you turn to your neighbor, say,
[2:41:09] "It's good to be in the house of the
[2:41:10] Lord this
[2:41:18] weekend. We're going to spend eternity
[2:41:21] [Music]
[2:41:27] together. I'm counting on
[2:41:29] you. I'm counting on
[2:41:33] you. I'm going to do my part. Will you
[2:41:36] help me?
[2:41:39] Let's go all the way.
[2:41:41] Let's go all the
[2:41:43] way. I'm kind of like Moses. I'm not
[2:41:46] good with this halfway
[2:41:47] religion. I ain't going out unless I can
[2:41:50] take all my cattle and I take all my
[2:41:52] children. I take all my prodals. I can
[2:41:55] take my worship with me and I can take
[2:41:56] my praise and I can take my Godhead and
[2:41:59] I can take eternal eternal security and
[2:42:01] everything. I'm not going out just
[2:42:03] halfway to worship. I'm going all the
[2:42:05] way out. And I'm like Moses. I ain't
[2:42:07] leaving one hoof
[2:42:10] behind. I'm
[2:42:12] committed. But will you go with me all
[2:42:14] the way?
[2:42:18] Maybe just by show of hands, we're going
[2:42:20] to finish this.
[2:42:25] Thank you for the encouragement. I was
[2:42:27] going to go without you or not, but I'm
[2:42:28] glad you're on my side.
[2:42:31] Let's go all the
[2:42:32] way. Praises be to the name of the Lord
[2:42:35] Jesus Christ. We're going to let you be
[2:42:37] dismissed today to go and worship the
[2:42:40] Lord. Go out reverently. Remember, this
[2:42:43] is the house of God. Carry your
[2:42:45] fellowship on the
[2:42:47] outside and enjoy our Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:42:51] May God richly bless you. We love you
[2:42:54] with all of our heart.
