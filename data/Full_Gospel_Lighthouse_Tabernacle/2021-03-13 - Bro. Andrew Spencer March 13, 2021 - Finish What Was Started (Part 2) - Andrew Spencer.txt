========================================

[Music] here's some time ago over in africa i was talking to him to an old saint he said brother brandon i know you believe in the supernatural and i said certainly my brother he said years ago i used to think i was somebody so i thought i was really a christian and he said then up in our church i had to climb a hill where i stopped my little car and said i had to climb a hill about over three or four hundred yards to get around the bushes and things getting up and said we'd have prayer meeting up there and said i thought i was really a christian he said i know all the bible i said it all the hebrew i studied all the right pronunciations of the words and said anybody walk up to me i can talk to him like that about the bible i know what i was talking about he said one night i was going up to church there'd been a lot of conflict in our church said this little party's against one another you know i raised i said yes sir he said oh my road up the hill i was walking and all at once i become conscious that somebody was following me and said i thought i'd wait just a little bit forever it was to catch up and i talked to him a little while as we went up the road you know that's kind of a good thing you just wait a little while it says as i walked up the hill come up a man came up the hill and said he had a bundle on his back they were way bigger than the man and said he was just a painting and a blowing hand making his little short steps trying to get up and i said fella can i help you pack this load up hill he said no i got a packet but i looked at his hands so i knew that it was a vision he had scars in his hands so i fell down and i said lord are you packing the sins of the world and that cycle said no i'm just packing yours just getting you up the hill just so you

there as they're going through this bless your brother shannon i'd like to just thank god for answering prayers and for all y'all's prayers for my cousin dwayne uh the other couple weeks ago when i brought that prayer request in he has a leukemia that is a very aggressive cancer the one that he's battling and the treatment that they gave him was just as aggressive and it's injured his kidney some but it damaged his heart greatly to where he couldn't get the stem cell transplant that he's needing and his heart got down to 30 percent and they wouldn't even consider it unless he could get his heart rate back up to 60. so they said he was going to need a uh pacemaker for his heart but he didn't even have a strong enough heart to take the procedure for that but with our prayers and ungodly answers he went just the other week and his heart has come up he's not gonna need no pacemaker any longer and i know that that's god that's done that and he he's not strengthening his heart for nothing if he's healing his heart he's going to heal his body as well and i believe that and i just like to thank you all for your prayers and thank god all throughout my history your faithfulness has walked beside me the winter storms made way for spring [Music] in every season from where i'm standing i see the evidence of your goodness all over my life all over my life [Music] and i see the promises and fulfillment all over my life all over my life help me remember when i'm weak [Music] fear may come but fear will lead [Music] you lead my heart to victory you are my strength and you always will be i see the evidence of your goodness all over my life all over my life [Music] not see the promises and fulfill all over my life all over my life [Music] i see the cross the empty grave the evidence is endless all my sins rolled away because of you o jesus see the cross the empty grave the evidence is endless all my sin rode away because of you o jesus whoa i see the evidence of your goodness all over my life [Music] all over my life and i see the promises and fulfillment all over my life all over my life [Music] i see the evidence of your goodness all over my life all over my life [Music] and i see the promises in fulfill all over my life all over my life so why should i fear the evidence is here oh why should i fear oh the evidence is here [Music] some people think you're distant just some words on a page that you're nothing more than fables handed down along the way but i've seen you part the waters when no one else could pull me from the deep that's who you are to me some people think you just live in cathedrals are made of stone but i know you live inside my heart i know that it's your home and i've seen you in a sunset and in the eyes of a stranger on the street that's who you are to me you're amazing faithful loves open door when i'm [Music] your empty your goodness sometimes i have my doubts i'm sure that everybody does and i wonder when i stumble in my

tell me jesus died from my transgressions that he paid the price a long long time ago when he gave his life for me on a hill called calgary but there's something else that i [Music] does he still feel the names time i fail does he hear them cry crystal then i know i've got to change [Music] and i treat his precious grace so carelessly but each time he oh forgives if he released the agony he fails on that tree [Music] every time i fail [Music] my [Music] oh i just can't bear [Music] does he still feel the names every time i fake him does he hear the crowd cry bruce then i know i've got to

just wanna be with you oh i just wanna be with you one more time [Music] i just wanna be with you oh god i just wanna be with you [Music] [Music] i just wanna be with you [Music] lord that is our true desire lord is to be in the place of revelation only with you lord lord not with our own ideas or mans the lord just to walk into the holies of holies lord and to catch a new glimpse of you or maybe in a way that we haven't seen that attribute before maybe that way we haven't seen your glory come down before lord we just want to be with you or we can't describe that feeling of being in the room and everyone else is standing around but you're standing right there you're ministering to our heart and you're delivering souls lord and without even saying a word you're right there you're right there father and you are speaking to our heart lord i believe that every person gathered here this evening lord their desire is to see you lord that you would open up the pages of the bible and you would start revealing yourself lord is the two brothers that were walking on the road to emmaus that day nor david it'd been so close but lord only when you did what you did before did they see that the one they'd been dealing with was jesus i pray that we would be very conscious here tonight hearing on the internet that jesus is closer than we think here to minister and here to touch i pray father as we yield our members to you tonight that you would take complete supreme control of this service i give myself over the kingdom of god jesus name amen god bless you this evening you have your bibles i'd like to look over in the book of john chapter 14 verse 10. trust everyone had a good week and man praise the lord lord i'd like to continue thought lord woke me up with these words on finishing what was started finishing what was started here and we'd like to take take our thought from john chapter 14 and verse 10 and jesus jesus said believeth thou not that i am in the father and the father and me the words that i speak unto you i speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works believe me that i am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very work's sake verily verily i say unto you that he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and greater works than these shall i do because i go unto my father and whatsoever you shall ask in my name that will i do that the father may be glorified in the son you shall ask anything in my name i will do it if you love me keep my commandments and i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you amen god bless his word you may be seated tonight in the presence of the lord so we we're very familiar with this scripture as believers but we understand that jesus is saying that he would continue his same works through the believers and through the life of his believers and here we are standing in this day and the day of utter chaos and really if you it doesn't take much of a look around and even if you don't listen to the news or whether you're not very much attached to social media or whatsoever but it doesn't take much to figure out that we're in the last day and that we're in perilous times but even in the midst of of total darkness and total chaos god still has a light in this generation and and god is still doing miraculous things and that that god is still proving and manifesting himself like never before and we've seen him standing right here amongst us we've seen him stand here in the person of the holy ghost and manifesting himself more and more into his church body and coming into his church body and making himself known and that's the reason why these things are happening and you're drawing closer to the father as the father's drawing closer to you and it seems like like darkness is trying to press the light out but really light is pressing the darkness out and here we we see that that god has given us a great commission to stand here in this hour and to finish what was started now to to entrust somebody with with such a thing that jesus himself has he's getting ready to make his departure and we can look over in mark 16 and we can look over in the book of john as as jesus is getting ready for his departure that jesus entrusted his most trusted people he entrusted the disciples that that didn't have a didn't know how to write their own name they didn't know they didn't know much about the sanhedrin court they didn't know about they didn't know about scriptures but yet jesus entrusted the father's business to his closest friends on earth so here jesus is is entrusting these believers this this man called simon peter the man that was the man that was a real man and here he is entrusting men like like saul with with his with his gospel with this business to take this and and run with this and you see he's telling them now you don't have to build a new platform you're not going to have to start a new religion but you just simply take what i've taught you do what you've seen me do you just step right into the role of what i was doing and you step right on in and you watch as the invisible union takes place as as i come down and i surround you and envelope you with the presence of almighty god you'll see that christ is the mystery of god revealed you'll see that i'm united with the headship you'll understand that i i'm depositing something on the inside of you and it's something that when god goes to trusting you with something it's amazing when we trust god simply when you walk by faith but when god goes to trusting you to me that's a whole nother level of faith that god would god would entrust human beings that are so so flipsy and flopsy when they're it this way in that way but yet god entrusted human beings he ain't entrusting your five sentences he ain't entrusting your faith and he ain't entrusting your your senses of of of seeing and feeling and tasting he's entrusting that which is down on the inside of your soul he is entrusting that soul realm of faith he was not looking at thee he was not looking at simon peter he was not looking at andrew and mark and luke he was not looking at the human realm he was looking into a realm that that nobody else around him could see there was a lot of people that were walking with jesus that didn't understand where jesus was walking they didn't understand the realm that jesus was living in that jesus had the ability to walk into a realm and pull down certain things that that only god himself would know about and there god was able was able to show jesus as he's walking into these realms he's walking with human beings but jesus is walking in another world and he's pulling these things out pulling them out of this realm and bring them in into this realm and he's showing you that maybe there is a life that's filled with blackness maybe there's a life that's filled with all kinds of addictions and maybe there's a life that's filled with all types of all types of things that were unpure but he's able to reach into this realm and show that now the one you're living with that's not your husband and you've been with five and he's able to take that blackness out of that soul and take that life and put it over that soul and make it pure white you see he's able to grab something out of that realm and bring it into this realm so that you would realize that you're not walking with just another man there were people that walked with moses that realized that moses was still moses after he did certain things when they let his temper loose they realized that moses was still moses but when the closest people on earth were walking with jesus they were recognizing this is more than moses this is more than a prophet this is more than a man this is something special that's taken place i say unto you that there is something special that is happening here it's more than a man it's more than a church it's more than a story it's the son of man and he's walking right down this room he's walking through this place and he's going to bring something out of this realm into this realm and you'll watch as that light begins to spread and push back the darkness and god will say over it is good it's good you see here the spirit is working through the flesh just like it did in jesus it's now working in the flesh of humanity and the bible says in colossians 2 and 12 that buried with him in baptism wherein you also risen with him through the faith of the operation of god who hath raised him from the dead so here we see that believers are quickened and changed and saved by the means of faith in the operation of god you see believing is something that you do but it's god's obligation to his promise to make sure that the promise comes to that faith that beliefs you see believing is the act of the soul so you could say that believing is what the soul does so when you look at something and it may look extraordinary or it may look extreme to the outside world you're just saying i'm doing what i was built to do there's some people that can't believe for healing but you as a believer just believe because that's what you do you you walk you you walk on water maybe it might be in a different maybe it be in a different form it might be walking on ice but yet you're walking on water because you believe and you might be able to walk on something that somebody else ain't able to walk to are you with me there's some people they can't walk on the promises of malachi 4. there's some people that can't walk onto revelations 10 and 8 that they can't prophesy what has been spoken but you're able to walk into a realm and do what the soul was built to do so the the act of the soul believing is the act of the soul but the power to believe comes from god himself are you with me the power to believe comes from god almighty himself and the bible said in john chapter 1 that he came into his own and his own received him not but to them but to them that believed on him to them gave he the power to be the sons of god even to them that believe on his name so the belief the power of believing comes from god there are some things that are hanging out there that are way too that are way too power for you to grab in your own human realm but what faith does faith is a substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen so there are things that are out there that are hanging and i and i'm just kind of putting it saying it that it's that it's out there there are things that are out there that you're not seeing there are things that are moving that you're not seeing but faith says it's going to happen faith looks into that realm it says i'm able to take that promise i'm able to receive that holy ghost i'm able to get this faith is reaching into a realm that you don't see and coming into the eternities and bring it into the naturality of life and humanity puts on divinity when it starts believing in the deity of jesus christ that that same deity that walked in jesus is walking in humanity and believing like jesus did and acting like jesus did and speaking like jesus did what is it when a believers start belief and they're doing what jesus did what did jesus do when he laid his hand on the leper he believed that he was god and when you lay your hand on the promises of god you're not believing as a humanity you're believing as a son of god and when you start acting like a son and believing like a son you'll stole hallelujah you'll start bringing things that are way too high for your humanity oh hallelujah there's no way you can live right in your humanity there's no way that you can talk right in your humanity there's no way that you can get into the spirit in your humanity but when you start believing there is something that comes over humanity that's for me that's for me and you start doing what jesus said do now when you look when the father starts entrusting the son he starts entrusting a son just like in a natural realm when a father starts watching a son how he's growing up how he's how he's matured in a way and then he starts entrusting him with things that only he would normally do but he starts entrusting the son with the family business and jesus said now he said you know where i would be yet you didn't expect me to be out in the world doing the things or building things like like joseph my protector but you expected me you you found me where i was built to be at here i am doing the father's business you can find me in the place of the father's business and here the father starts entrusting the son it's just like in galatians chapter 4 when that that when it begins to talk about adoption and it talks about placing of sons that the son is no different than the servant even though he be lord of all but yet it comes to a time when the father is looking over him and that son is under governors and tutors until appointed time of the father and that tudor is taking that son and he's and he's leading that son and he's teaching he's teaching that son about the father's business he's telling him about the father's business that if if your father was here this is how your father would act if your father was here this is what he would say if your father was here he wouldn't he would move this way he would he would be moved with compassion if the father was here this is the way he would handle the business and the tutor is then instructing the son that this is the way it does this is the way the father does his business this is the way he handles his business relationships and the son starts stepping into the role of what the father would do and you're starting to see that god loved fatherhood so much so that he could produce himself a son oh hallelujah it's not just one son but many sons and now the father is entrusting his children with what he said do and that tutor he would go to the father and sometimes maybe he would go to the father and the tutor would ask him now how's my son doing and maybe one time he brings back a report well you know he you know he's showing some great characteristics but he's just not up to par yet he's not quite there and i'll just i'll keep i'll keep watching you i watch how you do business and i'll keep instructing the son how he does business and and i'll bring and i'll start messing your your great ideas and i'll start messing your great works into the sun and i'll start making these things happen i make i'll just start telling that this is the way it's done but it's not quite there yet just give me a little bit more time but i'd say that there is a time that the holy ghost could come back and say now they are your children they do they do just like you do they love just like the father loves they act just like the father loves they they move just like the father moose they're a chip off the old block i watched you one time the father i watched you how you moved and i watched how you handled this situation and then i watched that son you see the father is now identifying that the son has come into a spot and he's getting ready to place him he's getting ready to place him as a son and so the father takes his son that he's watched as he's come to maturity he takes his son and he takes him out and he makes a public testimony of him and he puts a special robe over his son and he shows to the entire public that this is my son he's got the same authority that i've got his name on the checkbook is just as good as mine hallelujah you see when you got the baptism of the holy ghost you didn't have to go through seven steps till you get till you got place when you received the baptism of the holy ghost you were adopted you were placed as a son and when you act like the father you're not acting like yourself you're acting as the father you're doing like the father would do and when you sign that check your name is as good as it as it is jesus on that check because you can't separate you and the father brother branham would tell us that you're as eternal as god is eternal so that means you can't do without god and god can't do without you he's tell no somebody to believe him tonight he's counting on somebody to take his promises jesus went to a realm that nobody was willing to go to when he walked into a tomb and there was a man by the name of legion he was walking where nobody else wanted to go but this was a different man than a bunch of security cats up there in the said henry court that didn't want nothing to do with this man but this was the right candidate for jesus jesus was looking at a man and he's would say my message will work on him the things i'm doing and the things i'm preaching and who i am they'll work on him i wonder if anybody can identify when jesus come walking to the tombs and he looked at you and he said my message will work on you you've been in jail you've been in prison you've been in sin my message will work on you my message will so work on you that i'm going to entrust you with the same power that i got oh hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah what good would it do what good would it do if i gave my life if i gave my life and you would say that you have the life of andrew spencer on the inside of you and you weren't doing the works of andrew spencer my life would be in vain is that right if i let me just bring us into a realm so that i can make it personable to young people if i would tell you that i had the life of of magic johnson or or michael jordan or lebron james on the inside of me you would expect me to do the works of these great basketball heroes of some people and if i don't go out there and i don't have the ability to reach up there and dunk a basketball and do an alley-oop and do all these things you would say well that guy's just a fraud he's not really doing what he don't have that life it's something missing there and when people say they got the holy ghost and when there is no life to back up what they're saying there's something missing there so if i tell you i got the life of shakespeare i'll do the works of shakespeare if i tell you i got the life of a great mechanic on the inside of me i can work on cars if i say i got the life of jesus on the inside of me you'll expect me to finish the works that jesus did hallelujah jesus is saying you've seen me at work now do what i've done he's entrusting not just human beings not just people of religion but it's in trusting sons i was thinking about this i was thinking about the these thoughts today as i was i was looking over these things and that god is entrusting that god is entrusting you to believe that this whole message has told us that god almighty is entrusting you with the same power as he had but on december the 22nd 2019 there was a one that came from another realm and said that if you'll trust me i'll use you like you never before so you see it's a relationship of trust that god is entrusting you with this power but if you'll trust that power if you'll trust that power that's on the inside of you if you'll trust the power that that life that i gave at calvary if you'll trust the promises of god if you'll trust that i'm still the same yesterday today and forever if you trust that i'm bigger than cancer if you'll trust that i'm bigger than kovy if you'll trust me i'll use you like never before brother ron i know that was spoke directly to you but i want to say that we have watched we have watched this ministry as it's been trusting the almighty god and it's been used like never before it has walked us into another realm a realm of trust that only the father [Applause] you think about the miracles that's happened in the last year and a half you think about the the prodigals that have returned in the past year and a half you think about the life that's been changed in the last year and a half what caused that trust did he trusted you and you trusted him [Applause] oh hallelujah the cogs of prophecy are rolling right on time the oil of the holy spirit is on the wheels and everything's rolling hallelujah now watch what the prophet said when their eyes were open he said he said did you imagine the iq they required on the day of pentecost think about that just that segment did you imagine the iq that was required on the day of pentecost faith in god that's what they required right that's the requirement if thou believe us these signs shall follow them that believe jesus said he never said test them for their iq he said go into the whole world missionaries make disciples of all nations these sons shall follow them that believe that's the iq that's god's iq it's faith in god is all that god requires i'm so thankful that he didn't give us butcher hillbilly an iq test we couldn't hardly figure out our name in crayon when we was five years old much less when we get to be 30 something years old how to write it but thank god he didn't give us an intellectual test most of us wouldn't be sitting here tonight now i'm not trying to degrade your your intellects but i'm just simply saying if god would have trusted in your humanity you'd have never been setting here if god would have trusted in your intellect you'd never been setting here he didn't call the greater ideologies and the great einsteins of the day he called people that would believe he got people that were that were rugged believers that would stand square to toe to toe with the devil they'd say well hey i can't hardly spell my name but i believe that god said that i'm bigger than you [Applause] we're a body and the body works together it takes a team to build a house everybody loves seeing when the finisher comes in because they realize that the house is getting close i'm getting ready to move in i'm getting ready to make his home my home i'm getting ready to decorate the walls the way i want to decorate it there have been people all through this house that's been plastering the walls people painting it but when the finisher comes in and he's putting the final touches on on the house you know you're getting close to moving in everybody enjoys everybody enjoys the finisher but the man that laid the foundation had as much part in it as the man and the finisher is that right the man that the man that laid the block has as much a part in it as the man that puts the key in the door and makes sure it works and then comes the key hands the key to the owner of the house and said it's ready for you to move in [Applause] how you are you are a type of the 11th hour worker in this day and the same message that paul preached that started out there on the day of pentecost and it worked its way through seven h's down through the dark ages and it looked like it wasn't ever going to come through but the house was still getting built and then coming through the middle of luther and wesley but then there was a promise of an end time message that they would receive the same thing that paul received because they would receive the same thing that that paul that peter and james and john and all them believers they would receive may not have been working for maybe 20 or 30 years but you got the same reward coming that paul that paul received that same holy ghost that paul received you got here we are preaching what paul preached and we're seeing the same works that was produced in paul's ministry being produced in the last day ministry it wasn't just for william branham it's for a body see they without us cannot be made perfect and they are looking over the banisters of time and they're looking over and they're seeing the final touches being put on the house and they're looking at this house that everything's in order everything's in line the last one's the last block the last thing the last piece of mortar is being put on the bait's being put on the house they're saying run with everything you got we're getting ready to move into this home keep running brother met us keep running brother danny keep running he didn't just tell me he didn't just wake me up to tell me finish what was started for no reason he's got a voice to say something to you full gospel lighthouse finish finish what brother homer started finish what brother ron started finish run this race run with everything that's within you we're almost home it may look like you ain't got enough energy but press on keep pressing the mark oh we're almost home and the keeper of the keys is getting ready to step from that realm into this realm it says come up a little higher children oh blessed be the name of the lord somebody give him praise in the house of god turn with me over to deuteronomy chapter 31. oh hallelujah deuteronomy chapter 31 and moses went and spake these words and all israel and he said unto them i am 120 years old this day i can no more go out and come in if you don't know where deuteronomy is it's within the first five books of the bible and he said unto them i'm 120 years old this day and i can no more go out and come in also the lord has said unto me thou shalt not go over this jordan notice notice the lord thy god he will go over before thee and he will destroy these nations from before thee and thou shalt possess them and joshua and he shall go over before thee as the lord hath said and the lord shall do unto them as he did to zion and our king of the amorites and under the land of them whom he destroyed and the lord shall give them up before your face that you may do unto them according to all the commandments which i have commanded you be strong and of a good courage fear not nor be afraid of them for the lord thy god he it is that door doth goeth with thee he will not fail thee nor forsake thee and moses called unto joshua and said unto him in the sight of all israel be strong and of a good courage for thou must go of this people under the land which the lord has sworn unto their fathers to give them and thou shalt cause them to inherit it and the lord oh thank god it ain't joshua thank god it ain't moses thank god it ain't brother branham but it's the lord here it is that doth go before thee he will be with thee he will not fail thee neither forsake thee fear not neither be thou dismayed oh praise the lord here moses is getting ready to make his departure is final scenes of moses here and moses moses reaches reaches into a realm and there's a beautiful there's a beautiful beautiful sermon on the power of a reach that when moses starts reaching into a realm and he brings back into the memory of the people of what god has done it's amazing thing when you go to reaching into that memory and you start pulling into that memory channel and you start showing it before your own eyes and your own eyes start seeing what god has done and moses starts telling them about one of the greatest victories that they ever had and he starts reminding them of what god did to zion and ock and he starts telling them that there there's going to be that same god that walked with you and showed his power over zion and og he's going to be with you when you walk into this land that i commissioned you to go in now there's going to be some people that won't walk with you but you're going to walk there because the lord's going to go before you i'm making a way for you and moses is telling them you can be of goods here you can walk into that land and know that it's yours the obstacles you see might be big but it's yours you're showing them the power of god wasn't changing and that what god could do and what he did he's able to do it all over again what you've seen in zion and og he's getting ready to finish it through you and if god commanded them if he commanded the israelites to tear down the canaanites surely he would give him enough power to do so he'd give them power in their hands hands of war he'd give him weaponry that that the enemy wouldn't know nothing about the enemy had tactics they've been warriors for great times the amalekites but yet there was a weaponry that the americans didn't know nothing about when it looked like the amla kites had the israelites surrounded then god rained down hailstones they said we know nothing of this weaponry where does this power come from and moses is telling them you can be of good courage i'm telling you you can be confident in my promise because the god that well that walked with me and told me to go down to the red sea that god's gonna walk with you joshua you walk right into your commission you go out there and you too you've seen me do what i've done now you walk out there and finish what was begun he's telling him under my commission you meditate on these things and you'll have good success you speak these things and you'll have good success if you'll be confident in my promise if you'll be confident in the god that we serve he will take down all of your giants you go out there it was my job to get us right here now it's your job to lay out the land it's your job what day are you living in we're living in the parallel of joshua in the day of ephesians that this is a parallel that all of the property of god is laid out before you and paul would stand there and say blessed are you blessed are you are you happy quickened and you hath he made alive and you did he predestinate you can walk all around these promises because they're yours you remember you remember one time i was having a great deal i was having a great deal of of pressure while i was preaching here you as full gospel lighthouse you watched it we were having a great deal of carnality pressure that was keeping the holy ghost from moving and i watched as that separating line as it separated the unbelievers from the believers and god took me over in a corner and said look where you're standing church where are you standing at you're not standing with lot you're standing with abraham look all around look at the east look at the west look up look back all of these things are yours these are yours these are yours what is that that you need that's yours what jesus said ask anything in my name and i will do it you remember the drama that the prophet would tell us about he said if you had that great if you had that great arcade that great department store you just climb up on the ladder if you need a little bit of joy just climb up there and get that joy if you needed something to break fear just climb up there and maybe you get one of them doohickeys it's got that reacher on it and you it looks like you ain't never going to get there to get it but you just reach up there and you take that little doohickey and you get that thing down see the enemy thought that he could take that he could take and stick those promises way so high up there what the enemy doesn't realize that we're not messing with a doohickey i don't even know what to do hickey is we're not messing with a doohickey we're messing we're dealing with an open word that's able to reach into that realm when maybe you ain't got enough faith to get up there but there's somebody that's standing there that's bigger than you are [Applause] oh hallelujah and all of a sudden the holy ghost maybe you can't reach it but maybe there comes a wind of the holy ghost and knocks a jar of joy over on top of you and all of a sudden joy gets all over you and you start dancing in the spirit and you start shouting in the spirit and you start speaking in unknown tones i say let the holy ghost come and knock all the promises over his children [Applause] i won't be the only one that looks up doohickey tonight but joshua if you if you see what joshua's doing this is for you this is your land and caleb said he said now give me my mountain here he is at 85 years old he shouldn't be no he shouldn't be hey he should be be pushed in a wheelchair but he said i'm as strong as i ever was the body may be weak but my spirit is strong i'm as strong as i ever was this is my land this is my promise this is my holy ghost this is for me and my house we're gonna serve the lord that's for me and my house i believe my prodigals are coming back as for me and my house i believe we're gonna have joy in our house that's for me and my house we're gonna have worship in our house that's for me and my house we're gonna have praise in our house it's for me and my house we're gonna have a god that's bigger than our problems in our house for me at my house we're going to serve them every day of our life for me and my house when nobody else is hurting i'm going to serve it when everybody else gives up i'm not going to give up for me and my house oh what somebody say for me and my house prodigals are returning dry bones are shaking ah blessed be the name of the lord the bible says over in deuteronomy chapter 2 he says i have begun to give you begin to possess it i've begun to give it to you you begin to walk into it i've begun to give you the holy ghost you walk into the holy ghost i begin to give you these promises you possess these promises i gave it 2 000 years ago so that you down in laodicea could overcome every temptation every day for i give it to you you possess it who gave you this promise he was not a man he was the great i am everybody else was afraid to walk into it joshua and caleb said we were built to be there when everybody else brought back a bad report about this holy ghost when everybody brought back a bad reporter how big cove it is it's a bad devil it's bad it's so bad it'll tear away your family it'll shut up your mouth when everybody else was afraid to walk into that land there was two believers it was two believers they didn't deny that covet was big help me preach they didn't deny that cancer was bad they didn't deny that laodicea was bad they simply said that god said that it was for us they didn't deny that there was giants in that land they just simply agreed with what god said and they said we're more than able to take it sure they had some giants when they went over there to jericho sure they had some big walls over there when they went over into that land but they said we don't know how he's gonna do it but power to believe has come from god i didn't make myself believe this i didn't make myself walk into this something on the inside is working on the outside and i started tearing down the amalekites and i started tearing down old dirty websites and parasites and all these things i started walking into what he said prophet said you're more than a match for the enemy we're more than a match for the enemy that mean you don't match up to the devil that mean that you don't size up to the devil it doesn't mean that it doesn't mean that you're as smart as the devil it means you're smarter than him it doesn't mean that you're equal to him it means you're bigger than him it means you're stronger than him it means you're wiser than him it means that you're able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that i could ever ask or think according to the power that works on the inside of me i'm more than a match for the enemy what is it it's the god on the inside that says i'm more than a match you got more diseases than you ever could imagine in this day you got more surgeries you got more you got more things more people going to the doctor than they ever have in this whole entire world but every single time that jesus come up to a case he was more than a match for it he was more than a match for brother madam said now there's a real devil out there and he said he's just as real as you are he said but if you'll start taking and you'll start believing he said you'll start recognizing that the god on the inside of you is greater and mightier than he is he said then by the grace of god you're more than a match for the devil oh hallelujah when you start recognizing that the almighty god that created the heavens and the universe and all the suns and the stars if you'll start realizing that that same power that raised christ jesus from the dead is alive in you it's gonna quicken your mortal bodies now to the scientific world they can't understand that how did that little little girl get that great power on the inside of her well we don't know if we can walk that way or not it's not for the unbelievers to walk this way it's for the believers and believers just walk right into it oh hallelujah just walk right into it just walk right into it it's an amazing thing when you can start letting yourself loose i was talking to some brothers and sisters this week i was talking to them it's amazing thing when you can go to start letting yourself loose to the promises of god what will happen it's something very special that'll take place when you guard start letting yourself loose to the promises of god and start letting yourself loose to worship you ever watch somebody when they're in the moment of worship that you realize that they're not just singing a song but they're worshiping they're worshiping they're worshiping a god that's able to go farther than what they're even imagining you ever watch that person now there's some people that can sing and man they can just really sing and it's it's like they got the most trained voice that you ever heard in all your life and you're thinking my goodness how did they get to that realm of singing they they reach to that they reach into those keys and they've got such range but they can't hold the anointing whatsoever there's not a leak of anointing on them they get up and sing beautifully and it rolls off of you like your water does on a duck's back same way it does with the person that does i'm not pointing out anybody here i'm just speaking but you watch and you can find somebody that man they can't hardly sing they're a little bit out of tune but they get into a realm of worship and they don't care who's around them they don't care who's watching them they don't care they don't care if their voice squeaks they don't care if the the piano is out a little bit but man they're in a realm and they start letting themselves loose to worship and they start praising god and all of a sudden they let themselves loose and all of a sudden heaven comes down on that human and all of a sudden god just starts blessing not just the singer but he starts blessing the audience what is it that person knows how to let themselves loose when they go into that realm they've been there before and they want to stay there there's a realm of worship when you get to letting yourself loose that all of a sudden it's no longer you and the piano but it's you and jesus and you're making love with jesus and jesus is talking back to you and cooing to your heart and he's saying something real special because you let yourself loose you ever watched how the children of god started letting themselves lose to the promises of god when they started sitting back and they said now i know there might not be some people that can reach into that realm and bring them promises down but i'm letting myself loose i'm letting my faith loose into that promise of prayer and i'm gonna bring it down here and mary reached into that realm of a promise that was 800 years old she let herself loose to the angel's words and the angel spoke the name jesus and mary gave birth because she let herself loose to what the angel said daniel let himself loose and lions couldn't get him david let a rock loose because he let himself loose to the anointing of god that was on horn and there was no goliath going to stand in his way because he started letting himself loose what would happen in this place if you start letting yourself loose help me preach right here i'm about to quit resurrection power just struck the audience but what would really happen when you don't get worried about the time when you don't get worried about oh my goodness they weren't wearing a mask when they walked yet how dare they walk in my presence you'd think that we've been to church enough that we could realize that this is the most holy place that we could be in it's not about well i was clapping and somebody they must have been new here they just got to clapping off beat and mess me up and i just couldn't praise him right let me tell you if you've got a problem with the beat and you can't clap yourself right because of somebody else sitting behind you you need to let yourself loose to some real worship because when you start letting yourself loose to real worship to real praise you won't care who's singing behind you you won't care who's singing in front of you you won't care you'll start letting yourself loose and god will start letting himself loose to you i've instructed people that's come here and asked me can i sing this song or can i do this song don't you i have instructed people don't you ever get up here and sing a song that don't mean something to you because if it don't mean something to you it won't mean nothing to me i've instructed young preachers around this message don't you ever get up and preach something that ain't real to you or doesn't mean something to you because if it don't mean something to you it won't mean nothing to nobody else but if you can ever get into a tune and god drops a song on your heart and you say hey i gotta do something for the lord and you start letting that worship loose you know what i'm talking about you know what i'm talking about some people just get up to sing that don't impress me whatsoever but when you get up and you start making love to jesus you walk into his presence prayerfully say god so all leaders gonna sing his song music's gonna be going this way and i'm letting myself loose you ain't gotta be up here to let yourself loose what would happen to the people that are sitting around you tonight if you start letting your faith loose into the promises of god the things that you prayed and it seems like and it's never going to happen what would happen if you start letting yourself loose would it be just like paul and silas when they started letting herself loose and they didn't look at their circumstances they didn't look what was around them but they was looking into a realm of praise and worship not only did it let paul and silas loose it let everybody around them loose what would happen what would happen in this place around this message around this around the internet now listening if you really set yourself loose to believing believing for miracles yes you can have them believing for healing you can have it if you just walked into that realm and you let yourself loose let's stand oh i bless your name i bless your name i give you honor i give you my praise you are the light the truth away i bless your name i bless your name i'll just bless the name of the lord i bless your name i bless your name oh i give you water i give you praise you are the life the truth away i bless your name i bless your name one more time i bless your name [Music] oh i bless your name i'll give you one ear i give you praise i miss your name i bless your name in prisoner's chains in prisoner's chains [Music] let's pray [Music] began to sing oh hallelujah their chains were loose and they were free oh god i bless your name [Applause] i give you honor i give you praise [Music] just go to praising the lord just now to the winds of faith i'll just ask the lord something special ask him for that faith to let loose ask him for that power of worship to let some things loose in your life and the people around you to believe for the impossible and watch the impossible become visible to set your wings to the winds of faith oh do not struggle it's my grace [Music] oh [Music] just take the word of god for what you see believe [Music] is [Music] [Music] of faith [Music] oh do
