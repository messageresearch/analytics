[42:14] a few things known to you due to all of
[42:18] the foreseen things that are that are
[42:20] coming and not not releasing us and
[42:23] different things that are still going on
[42:24] we have decided to postpone our fourth
[42:28] of July meetings this year and also our
[42:30] Labor Day meetings until we are able to
[42:33] hold a crowd and we don't know exactly
[42:34] when we'll set that date whether it's in
[42:37] the fall or wherever we're just
[42:39] postponing those things so we've got
[42:41] three great speakers that are that are
[42:43] just waiting for a phone call and so
[42:45] just be be mindful of those sayings just
[42:48] want to make those things known to you
[42:50] to be praying about those things and I'm
[42:52] just thankful that we can have service
[42:54] in this manner this evening
[42:56] also Lord willing in the morning we'll
[42:58] be having a baby dedication for sister
[43:01] Haven Hill and all that is due and
[43:06] depending on how our pastors feeling and
[43:09] the enemy pulled a slick one this
[43:11] evening and tried to punch him right
[43:13] before service and so he was on his way
[43:16] here and and just the enemy got mad and
[43:19] so we just want to be remembering
[43:20] brother on God would touch his body
[43:23] supernaturally
[43:25] just now and we know that the miracles
[43:27] coming and we know that it's on its way
[43:30] and we know Jesus is on his way and so
[43:33] we're studying our course according to
[43:35] his word not according to our emotions
[43:38] nor our feelings nor even how bad the
[43:41] situation's look in our lives we study
[43:43] our course to the Word of God for
[43:46] everything else around us is changing
[43:47] but his word remains the same a man as
[43:51] the as brother Matthew said at the end
[43:53] of the service the sisters have
[43:54] something set outside for you and that's
[43:58] for all the guys little boys myself
[44:02] included and I was I've got an inkling
[44:06] on what they are so I'll try to preach
[44:08] fast so I can enjoy it with you and and
[44:12] so we we just want to do that for
[44:15] Father's Day we want to enjoy this
[44:17] Father's Day it's coming up tomorrow and
[44:20] want to be mindful mindful of our
[44:22] Heavenly Father and also our earthly our
[44:25] father's here and truly we wouldn't be
[44:28] here without them and so we just want to
[44:30] make sure - to honor our fathers and we
[44:34] know that that gives us longevity of
[44:36] life and we do that we do that because
[44:39] it's a commandment to us and and we
[44:43] certainly love and appreciate every one
[44:46] of you fathers and soon-to-be father's
[44:48] and and we're just expecting expecting
[44:52] great things from the Lord and so
[44:54] cherish every day that you have with
[44:56] your family because every day is a
[44:59] present from the Lord and so cherish
[45:01] those things and I think I think times
[45:04] like we go through and we go through
[45:06] valleys that makes you appreciate the
[45:08] good times it makes you appreciate life
[45:10] and I believe that this church is very
[45:13] appreciative of all the things that
[45:15] we've been through and all the things
[45:16] that every one of us were truly a family
[45:18] and when one of us is hurting all of us
[45:22] is hurting and so so never feel alone
[45:25] because we're right there with you and
[45:27] we're in we're with you in the battle
[45:29] and sometimes you may not see us maybe
[45:31] you don't see a brother or sister but
[45:33] know that without a shadow of a doubt
[45:34] they're there praying for you
[45:36] upholding you by the word of prayer and
[45:39] we're just we're just a family we're a

[52:04] [Music]

[52:23] can't find nobody greater than him
[52:26] there's no one in the whole entire
[52:30] nation I can heal you can mend you and
[52:34] make you whole
[52:35] but this Lord Jesus that we introduce to
[52:39] you it's more than able to do all things
[52:43] for you let's go to him and prayer this
[52:46] evening father we come and we approach
[52:49] your throne of grace boldly Lord
[52:53] realizing that you have released to us a
[52:56] portion of your mind Lord in this day
[52:59] that were standing in knowing that that
[53:03] all things have been released to us a
[53:07] father you've not dispersed stayed
[53:10] a new word father were added a word
[53:14] taken away anything father you've just
[53:18] released
[53:19] the unwritten water father would stand
[53:23] here as believers this true ordered of
[53:27] God Lord that's why we're here the same
[53:31] because we desire a portion of your your
[53:35] word to be deposited into our hearts
[53:37] father to take us further in our journey
[53:40] of life Lord we we don't understand that
[53:44] we can't see the future Lord you're
[53:48] already in it and you know how to
[53:51] release a word in this hour that'll take
[53:54] us through in our future and I pray that
[53:57] you would deliver the very the very
[54:00] thoughts of God to us tonight
[54:02] Lord where your children men were very
[54:05] needy
[54:06] and we just humbly request that you come
[54:10] the Lord you see ever need here you see
[54:13] our pastor the enemy has struck down and
[54:16] and may do this evening
[54:20] father I was reading over up reading
[54:24] over a statement brother Bannerman said
[54:28] he was standing there at a prayer line I
[54:33] was a man standing before him that was
[54:37] dealing with sugar issues the Branham
[54:41] tapped into that channel said thou demon
[54:43] of hell that is bounded with sugar if
[54:46] you don't release him may a double
[54:49] punishment come upon you
[54:52] father I don't know how to do that Lord
[54:56] but I ask on to you to release a double
[54:59] portion a hail towards the enemy that
[55:03] struck down our pastor father pray that
[55:06] you'd restore him back father
[55:09] for you bring him back Father Lord Jesus
[55:12] I pray that you would do the work that
[55:15] you promised that you would do now Lord
[55:18] Jesus every person sitting here under
[55:20] the sound of my voice father they've not
[55:22] come to hear me they're not that petty
[55:26] minded to think that I could speak to
[55:28] them on their needs but they have come
[55:30] because they have heard that there's a
[55:32] being a god that that's being introduced
[55:35] here from this pulpit and I pray father
[55:38] that here and that on the other side of
[55:40] the streaming that you would introduce
[55:42] yourself as the same yesterday today and
[55:46] forever we ask that you would take
[55:49] control of this service for the glory of
[55:52] the Lord and the Bride of Christ says
[55:56] they may bless you if you have your
[55:59] Bibles this evening we'll turn over to
[56:04] her to the book of Hebrews chapter 1 and
[56:07] verse 1 and then also down to 2nd
[56:09] Corinthians chapter 4 and verse 7
[56:22] hebrews chapter 1 and verse verse 1 God
[56:32] who at sundry times and in divers
[56:35] manners spake in times passing to the
[56:37] father's by the prophets hath in these
[56:41] last days spoken unto us by his son whom
[56:44] he hath appointed heir of all things by
[56:47] whom also he made the world's who being
[56:51] the brightness of his glory and the
[56:53] Express image of his person and
[56:55] upholding all things by the word of his
[56:58] power when he had by himself purged our
[57:00] sins sat down on the right hand of the
[57:04] Majesty on high 2nd Corinthians chapter
[57:08] 4 and verse 7 Paul says here but we have
[57:21] this treasure in earthen vessels that
[57:25] the the excellency of the power may be
[57:29] of God and not of us we are troubled on
[57:33] every side yet not distressed we are
[57:36] perplexed but not in despair persecuted
[57:40] but not forsaken cast down but not
[57:44] destroyed
[57:45] always bearing about in the body of the
[57:48] dying of the Lord Jesus that the life
[57:51] also of Jesus might be made manifest in
[57:54] our body for we which live are always
[57:57] delivered unto death for Jesus sake that
[58:00] the life also of Jesus might be made
[58:03] manifest in our mortal flesh so then
[58:06] death worketh in US but life in you we
[58:09] have in the same spirit of faith
[58:11] according as it is written I believed
[58:13] and therefore have I spoken we also
[58:16] believe in therefore speak therefore
[58:20] have I spoken we also believe and
[58:24] therefore speak so if you believe you
[58:27] can speak these things knowing that he
[58:31] which raised up the Lord Jesus shall
[58:33] raise us
[58:34] raise up us also by Jesus and shall
[58:37] present us with you for all things are
[58:41] for your sakes that the abundant grace
[58:43] might through the Thanksgiving of many
[58:46] redound to the glory of God for which
[58:49] cause we faint not but though our inward
[58:51] outward man perish yet the inward man is
[58:55] renewed day by day
[58:56] for our light affliction which is but
[58:58] for a moment worketh for us a far more
[59:01] and exceeding and eternal weight of
[59:04] glory while we look not at the things
[59:06] which are seen but of the things which
[59:09] are not seen for the things which are
[59:11] seen are temporal but the things which
[59:14] are not seen are eternal may God bless
[59:17] his word you may be seated in the
[59:19] presence of the Lord so said would like
[59:21] to speak to you again on introducing the
[59:23] god of omnipotence and as we read here
[59:26] in the last verse verse 18 that while we
[59:29] look not at the things which are seen
[59:31] and it's very easy in the day that we're
[59:34] living in to get caught up with the
[59:36] things that we're seeing to get caught
[59:38] up with what the world is doing in the
[59:40] chaos that it's in and we realize that
[59:42] God has a law and that law is a law of
[59:45] contrasts that that we would not we
[59:47] could not understand we could not
[59:50] understand the daylight unless we had
[59:52] the nighttime and we could not
[59:53] understand the sunshine unless we had
[59:56] clouds and we could not understand
[59:58] health if we didn't have days with days
[1:00:01] of infirmity and days when we're sick
[1:00:03] but God is here in this hour and he's
[1:00:06] releasing to us and it's in the hour of
[1:00:09] extreme things in which God displays his
[1:00:12] his majesty and his wonders is when he
[1:00:15] shows forth or when we see things as he
[1:00:18] is declaring himself he's always God
[1:00:21] he's 100% of the time absolutely God but
[1:00:24] sometimes we get caught up with the
[1:00:26] things that we see and we get caught up
[1:00:29] with what we're looking at that we
[1:00:30] forget that God is always there but God
[1:00:33] it's in those moments or in those
[1:00:36] extreme measures of deepness of despair
[1:00:39] that when we truly see God as he truly
[1:00:42] is
[1:00:42] and we get our eyes off of the things
[1:00:45] that we're that we're looking at and we
[1:00:47] begin to look into another realm and to
[1:00:49] see the things that God is wanting us to
[1:00:51] see and we realize that the hour that
[1:00:54] we're living in is the darkest of days
[1:00:56] and we realize that that when brother
[1:00:58] Branham was preaching the seven church
[1:01:00] ages that he was drawing it out on the
[1:01:02] blackboard and brother Branham was
[1:01:03] allowed to draw in a certain amount of
[1:01:05] light in this last day and that light
[1:01:07] represented you and I and then those
[1:01:09] lights flashed on the wall to declare
[1:01:11] exactly what he had just spoken was thus
[1:01:14] saith the Lord and it was declaring that
[1:01:16] he was God so we realized that that
[1:01:19] we're living in an hour when things are
[1:01:21] the darkest that they could absolutely
[1:01:22] be there they're the darkest we look
[1:01:25] through the dark ages and we think my
[1:01:27] they're so dark but there's never been
[1:01:29] such a lukewarm spirit that the children
[1:01:32] of God have ever had to battle through
[1:01:34] like the day that we're living in and we
[1:01:38] see that when when the Prophet would
[1:01:40] stand there in Shalom
[1:01:41] he said you're seeing a facing or we're
[1:01:44] facing a mixture of light and darkness
[1:01:47] that the world is in the most chaotic
[1:01:50] times of darkness that it's ever stood
[1:01:53] in but yet it's standing in again the
[1:01:55] most blessed light that it's ever stood
[1:01:57] in so we see that we're living in a
[1:02:00] contrast of time that because because
[1:02:03] we're in this darkness we can understand
[1:02:06] that we're not of that darkness but we
[1:02:08] understand that light shines it's very
[1:02:11] best when it is dark outside you know
[1:02:15] it's the darkest right before the
[1:02:17] daylight begins to spring it gets so
[1:02:19] dark and it gets so miserable and you
[1:02:22] would think that nighttime is just
[1:02:23] continuing or just starting but when you
[1:02:26] are in those dark moments or in those
[1:02:28] dark valleys just know that there's
[1:02:31] light coming there's going to be moments
[1:02:33] in your life when you feel like God
[1:02:35] ain't around but just know that God is
[1:02:38] right there and if you can roll away the
[1:02:40] darkness you'll see the light of day it
[1:02:43] is the evening light and it's shining on
[1:02:46] the children of God
[1:02:49] now listen to this in 1965 of December
[1:02:54] the 12th at communion now this is the
[1:02:55] last service brother Branham takes and
[1:02:58] he speaks to us on communion now these
[1:03:00] now anybody knows that if you search out
[1:03:03] a man's life you look at his last words
[1:03:05] and and you watch as the Prophet is is
[1:03:08] speaking and he's uttering out these
[1:03:10] things because he knows that the that
[1:03:12] the end is in front of him and notice
[1:03:15] what he says here he said now there's
[1:03:16] one thing that I want to say just before
[1:03:19] we start the communion is this that I
[1:03:21] believe that we have seen enough in our
[1:03:24] day that we live in that we ought to
[1:03:26] really give all of our being to God that
[1:03:29] we should really serve God I believe
[1:03:32] that he has blessed us with the direct
[1:03:34] answer to the scripture as brother Perry
[1:03:37] gave it a few moments ago that that we
[1:03:40] are at that time that we're not blind we
[1:03:43] see that we're here we have arrived and
[1:03:47] we also can look around and see like the
[1:03:50] way that the human mind is leaving the
[1:03:52] people that's exactly where we're at
[1:03:55] that we can't stay too much longer or
[1:03:59] we'd be in a complete insane institution
[1:04:02] the whole world would be we're at the
[1:04:05] end time now here the prophet is
[1:04:07] relaying to us something that was there
[1:04:10] in 1965 but was declaring something that
[1:04:14] is very pertinent to you in 2020 it's a
[1:04:17] time when the human mind is escaping
[1:04:19] humans and they no longer have sense
[1:04:21] they no longer have common sense I've
[1:04:24] found in life that common sense is not
[1:04:26] very common but some people actually
[1:04:28] have to pay for that sense but we find
[1:04:31] where people are so in a neurotic state
[1:04:34] where they don't even realize who they
[1:04:35] are anymore
[1:04:36] don't realize what they were born to be
[1:04:38] don't realize what they were placed here
[1:04:40] to be they even can't even find their
[1:04:42] way in the right bathroom anymore but
[1:04:44] you are living in such a chaotic time
[1:04:46] that men don't know who they are and
[1:04:49] women don't know who they are but
[1:04:51] there's a people own
[1:04:53] hallelujah that knows exactly where
[1:04:55] they're standing that knows who she is
[1:04:57] and knows what he wants done with the
[1:04:59] word you see in this utter chaos there
[1:05:03] is a light that is shining and that man
[1:05:06] is here to turn on the light it's just
[1:05:11] like at the very beginning God is
[1:05:13] separating the light from darkness and
[1:05:15] it's an hour when we're not seeing we're
[1:05:18] not seeing an invisible God but we're
[1:05:20] seeing his visible presence made known
[1:05:23] to you and I now you may not see him but
[1:05:27] do not look at the things which you see
[1:05:30] look past what you see but here the
[1:05:34] visible presence of God is being made
[1:05:36] manifest where we're watching the works
[1:05:39] of the Son of Man when the word of God
[1:05:41] is being dispersed in this hour like
[1:05:43] never before
[1:05:45] this message has produced God's best do
[1:05:51] you understand what I'm saying that this
[1:05:53] message has produced the bride stress
[1:05:56] where and God is very at ease very till
[1:06:00] it's where he's not dilatory but he's
[1:06:02] very diligent in who he allows to speak
[1:06:05] to his wife and you are watching some
[1:06:08] now I'm not under saying that about
[1:06:11] myself I'm saying about the other men of
[1:06:12] God and I'm just thankful to be a part
[1:06:15] of that portion but you're seeing a
[1:06:17] people of God and ministers of God let's
[1:06:20] grab a hold of this word and to do a
[1:06:22] quick work for the Lord and you're
[1:06:24] watching it as men grab ahold of this
[1:06:26] message and take this message and go
[1:06:29] running like a never before you see this
[1:06:33] is the reality of the word made plain in
[1:06:37] view right in front of you and I this is
[1:06:40] not a message of reformation but this is
[1:06:43] a message of the full restoration of the
[1:06:47] Word of God you see that is exactly who
[1:06:50] we are we're full gospel people this
[1:06:53] scottsville that we preach to you is not
[1:06:55] a gospel that's full of holes it is a
[1:06:57] whole gospel now you can't pick out what
[1:07:01] you own and what you like and what you
[1:07:03] don't want but this is
[1:07:05] book that you have to eat the whole book
[1:07:08] well you asked me are you with me we're
[1:07:12] living in that hour when the Word of God
[1:07:14] is made restored it's completely
[1:07:16] restored and the fruit is at the top of
[1:07:18] the tree as we are told by Joe that in
[1:07:21] the last days that I will pour out my
[1:07:23] spirit upon all flesh that we're living
[1:07:27] in this hour where all Israel no know
[1:07:30] that I am the Lord and I am in the midst
[1:07:33] of them and my people shall never be a
[1:07:36] saint now you've been standing in the
[1:07:38] last few months and you're living in a
[1:07:40] spot when everybody else is kind of
[1:07:42] kicked back and relaxed and enjoyed
[1:07:44] their self a time but you're living as a
[1:07:46] people that you kept the standard you
[1:07:50] kept the faith through the darkest of
[1:07:52] times you were still real men and women
[1:07:56] of God what was that that was him
[1:07:59] working on the inside of you hallelujah
[1:08:05] when you see churches being shut down or
[1:08:08] you see when you see men being shut down
[1:08:10] because of things that they're doing you
[1:08:13] are watching you are watching Satan at
[1:08:15] his very best but this is the hour of
[1:08:19] restoration that he'll bring out of that
[1:08:21] whole conglomeration a church that's
[1:08:24] blood walks that's a Bible Belt award
[1:08:26] solid bride of Jesus Christ I says here
[1:08:32] in Ephesian Church age that that he that
[1:08:34] hath an ear let him hear what they what
[1:08:36] the spirit saith unto the churches
[1:08:38] how tragic is it it is that the first
[1:08:42] age did not listen to the spirit instead
[1:08:45] it listen to man but thank God in the
[1:08:48] last days there will be a group rise up
[1:08:50] the true bride of the last day and she
[1:08:53] will listen to the spirit in that day of
[1:08:55] gross darkness the light will return by
[1:08:58] the pure word and we will return
[1:09:01] hallelujah and we will return to the
[1:09:04] power of Pentecost to welcome back the
[1:09:07] Lord Jesus Christ oh give the Lord a
[1:09:10] hand clap oh please
[1:09:14] allelujah this message has done exactly
[1:09:18] that
[1:09:19] it has introduced us to our Lord Jesus
[1:09:22] Christ now we realize we realized that
[1:09:25] that there had to be a full running of
[1:09:28] Jesus in his first coming and that
[1:09:30] there's a second guy a forerunner that
[1:09:32] is coming before his second coming now
[1:09:35] we don't want to miss what is happening
[1:09:37] because they missed him in his first
[1:09:39] coming they miss the first runner the
[1:09:42] first floor runner and they again many
[1:09:44] have missed the second floor runner but
[1:09:47] we want to be diligent in our looking
[1:09:50] and diligent in our speaking and
[1:09:52] diligent in our praying that we don't
[1:09:54] miss what's happening now gardening just
[1:09:57] give us this message just to have
[1:09:59] another church or two maybe just make us
[1:10:02] huh hey people that's called out but he
[1:10:04] has to give us this message to introduce
[1:10:08] hallelujah the headship to a body and we
[1:10:13] realize that these things that are being
[1:10:15] relayed to us they have not come from
[1:10:18] some man's mind are you with me they
[1:10:21] didn't just edit just come out of some
[1:10:23] back study they came from the mind of
[1:10:27] God you look at the things that are
[1:10:30] happening
[1:10:31] there's no denomination that could
[1:10:33] create these things there's no there's
[1:10:35] no idea or theology that could tap into
[1:10:38] these sources or tap into that channel
[1:10:40] and come in and break those things out
[1:10:42] now I know that you think that I'm stuck
[1:10:45] on a treadmill
[1:10:46] and I keep speaking to you the same
[1:10:47] things but I'm trying to get something
[1:10:49] to you I'm trying to build you up and be
[1:10:53] rooted in the faith like Paul told us to
[1:10:56] be over in the book of Colossians I'm
[1:10:58] trying to tell you Church that there is
[1:11:01] one that is standing amongst you right
[1:11:03] now that is willing to move in your life
[1:11:07] if you just reach out and touch him
[1:11:10] blind bartimaeus reached out one day and
[1:11:13] his cry hallelujah got ahold of him it
[1:11:16] got ahold of the offer of life what was
[1:11:20] it he got the attention of Jesus
[1:11:23] tonight that your need so gets the
[1:11:25] attention of Jesus that Jesus comes
[1:11:27] walking down the aisle talks to you lip
[1:11:30] to ear and he speaks directly to your
[1:11:32] heart
[1:11:34] hello we don't want to miss what's going
[1:11:39] on we look at the things and so many
[1:11:42] times these stories they become stories
[1:11:45] to us when they're more than stories
[1:11:48] it's God showing you that I am in my
[1:11:51] creation and I'm making creation so many
[1:11:55] times we look over and we see when when
[1:11:59] brother Branham spoke those squirrels
[1:12:00] into existence and we just we take those
[1:12:03] things regret us but that was more can
[1:12:07] you imagine a denomination trying to
[1:12:10] produce that they can't do it they can't
[1:12:14] do it because they have not returned
[1:12:17] back to the pure word sure they want the
[1:12:21] restoration of gifts but they don't want
[1:12:23] headship but here we watch this event
[1:12:27] take place and now we wonder and we all
[1:12:30] had those things and think my how we
[1:12:32] would love just to create something
[1:12:34] sometimes but it was God showing forth
[1:12:38] his glory that it was deity in man
[1:12:42] speaking through a man you remember when
[1:12:44] brother Branham was standing there and
[1:12:46] speak to this mountain he said he had
[1:12:48] spoke most he said now what are you out
[1:12:49] here hunting
[1:12:50] he said squirrels he said well how many
[1:12:52] do you need and he said three now
[1:12:53] brother Branham said nice and I've done
[1:12:55] told those other two squirrels and spoke
[1:12:57] those other two squirrels where they
[1:12:58] would be and he said I was sitting there
[1:13:00] and I said well that's about enough
[1:13:02] actually he got a second one he said now
[1:13:04] that's enough he said it's about time
[1:13:06] for me to go and something said to me
[1:13:08] are you doubting that are you doubting
[1:13:11] what you spoke and he said no I'm not
[1:13:14] doubting that and he said he waited
[1:13:16] there another five or five or so minutes
[1:13:18] and he said well it's about time for me
[1:13:20] to get going and the angel said are you
[1:13:23] doubting what you spoke you said that
[1:13:26] there would be three are you doubting
[1:13:28] what you spoke and he said no and he
[1:13:32] said when I said
[1:13:33] that other squirrel came into existence
[1:13:35] right where I said it would be it was
[1:13:38] showing to you and I hallelujah that
[1:13:42] there was not just a man on earth that
[1:13:44] could create squirrels it was showing to
[1:13:46] you that if we could approach him with a
[1:13:50] faith that is not mixed up with some
[1:13:52] creed or some denominational idea but
[1:13:55] come forth in its shrewd pureness that
[1:13:58] he could speak to the mountain and the
[1:14:01] mountain be moved alleluia alleluia
[1:14:09] this was the creator in action through
[1:14:14] humanity now the bible jesus said
[1:14:20] himself speaking about john the baptist
[1:14:24] that there was not a man born of a woman
[1:14:28] that was greater than John the Baptist
[1:14:31] that's what Jesus said
[1:14:33] but Jesus follows that same to record
[1:14:36] and says he that is least in the kingdom
[1:14:39] of heaven is greater than he
[1:14:41] do you realize who you are this evening
[1:14:44] some of you said here and you think oh
[1:14:46] my I'm just happy to be laughs I made it
[1:14:52] through coronavirus but he hallelujah
[1:14:55] that is weakness or is least in the
[1:14:58] kingdom of heaven is greater
[1:15:01] well illusion I am trying to get you to
[1:15:04] see your possession in Christ hallelujah
[1:15:08] I know that some of you think that's all
[1:15:10] I preached but if you could ever find
[1:15:12] your position hello somebody I've heard
[1:15:16] it said well that brother on and brother
[1:15:18] Andrew say all they speak about is a
[1:15:20] believers position in Christ if you
[1:15:22] realize the believers position in Christ
[1:15:25] will take a body change
[1:15:31] I notice I sent this to the brothers I
[1:15:35] don't know if they got it or not but he
[1:15:37] said now the brother man said now I
[1:15:39] believe that the Church of the Living
[1:15:41] God is moving into the sphere now that's
[1:15:45] going to shake the whole world that's
[1:15:48] the first time it's been speaking of the
[1:15:50] squirrel since the days of Jesus of
[1:15:53] Nazareth to a human being ask anything
[1:15:56] that you will and it shall be given unto
[1:15:58] you anything you desire don't you see
[1:16:02] the words of Jesus Christ being
[1:16:03] fulfilled oh it's going to come to pass
[1:16:06] pretty soon oh I'm looking for it to
[1:16:08] happen in this meeting I'm wanting it to
[1:16:11] happen now that anointing will strike
[1:16:14] the whole Church of the Living God and
[1:16:15] she'll raise up to her feet like a
[1:16:18] mighty marching army the sick will be
[1:16:20] healed by word the blind will see the
[1:16:23] death will hear the Dead will be raised
[1:16:25] up and the power of God was sake the
[1:16:27] whole world with the Church of the
[1:16:29] Living God were in the process of it now
[1:16:33] I believe it's soon coming to pass I
[1:16:36] believe he will be just exactly that way
[1:16:39] I believe it's going to strike the
[1:16:41] Church of God soon and it's going to
[1:16:43] start a revival that'll shake the world
[1:16:45] I believe it the Lord God of heaven who
[1:16:48] made heavens and earth who serve and I
[1:16:51] am and stand here now before you in the
[1:16:53] name of Jesus Christ those words are
[1:16:56] true
[1:16:57] oh we're near something
[1:17:00] my heart's waiting with anticipation so
[1:17:04] you can see the prophets anticipation of
[1:17:07] of this striking the church I want to
[1:17:11] say to you Church of the Living God
[1:17:12] we're here we have arrived we're not
[1:17:16] waiting for it to come it's here well I
[1:17:22] don't see it
[1:17:23] are you sitting in this church today
[1:17:25] there have been a people praying that
[1:17:28] this night would come
[1:17:32] you are here we have arrived there were
[1:17:38] not seekers of slides and seekers or
[1:17:41] wonders but we are told that signs and
[1:17:43] wonders will follow them that believe
[1:17:46] we're not out here searching for a sign
[1:17:49] in the hand looking for wonders or
[1:17:51] looking who can create and looking for
[1:17:54] that those things if you're a believer
[1:17:55] are to follow you so if I walk this way
[1:18:00] signs who wonders have got to follow me
[1:18:03] is there a church so if I preached the
[1:18:07] same message that Paul preached then
[1:18:09] signs and wonders have to follow me I
[1:18:12] don't follow them there in the church
[1:18:18] they're active they're moving and we're
[1:18:21] watching none other than Elohim
[1:18:25] declaring himself now if you look over
[1:18:28] in the Bible in Exodus chapter 6 you
[1:18:30] look there and you see that when when
[1:18:33] Moses is standing there having a
[1:18:35] conversation with God he tells him he
[1:18:38] tells him now I have declared myself as
[1:18:41] the Lord Almighty al-sharia to Abraham
[1:18:44] Isaac and Jacob but by my name Jehovah
[1:18:48] have I not declared my name he has not
[1:18:52] declared himself so God was telling them
[1:18:54] that I'm getting ready to declare myself
[1:18:57] as a name in a name that you've never
[1:19:00] seen before you see they had watched him
[1:19:03] as Jehovah Jireh they had watched him as
[1:19:06] hell said he either breasted one and he
[1:19:08] would bring them up to himself and they
[1:19:10] would draw from his bosom and draw
[1:19:12] strength from them but now he was
[1:19:15] getting ready to declare himself as the
[1:19:18] mighty deliverer they were in such a
[1:19:22] chaotic spot that they couldn't get out
[1:19:24] on their own but God had come down to
[1:19:28] show forth his power that he is Jehovah
[1:19:33] I believe he's still Jehovah how many is
[1:19:36] in the building tonight I noticed that
[1:19:38] when he came all of these titles were
[1:19:41] declaring a portion of who he is but
[1:19:44] when Jesus showed up two thousand years
[1:19:48] ago he embodied embodied all of those
[1:19:51] titles hallelujah he was declaring
[1:19:55] himself as Jesus that we are told that
[1:19:59] there's no other name under heaven on
[1:20:01] earth given among men whereby you must
[1:20:03] be saved but by the name of Jesus by the
[1:20:07] name of Jesus you can be set free by the
[1:20:11] name of Jesus you can be delivered by
[1:20:13] the name of Jesus you can be completely
[1:20:17] made whole there are miracles in his
[1:20:20] name there are way makings in his name
[1:20:23] there is deliverance there are all
[1:20:25] things in his name
[1:20:32] you remember brother Branham had to deal
[1:20:34] with with a nervousness in his own
[1:20:36] condition that he had he had dealt with
[1:20:38] it and they would come and it would he
[1:20:40] would come to him and it would
[1:20:41] completely come be completely tear him
[1:20:44] down and wear him down you remember
[1:20:46] those things that he would deal with
[1:20:48] those things that you remember that the
[1:20:49] Lord gave him a vision of this this
[1:20:53] little squirrel that was he said it was
[1:20:55] six inches long is that right you
[1:20:57] remember that exact thing but notice
[1:20:59] that the vision before was saying that
[1:21:02] brother Branham said no he said I was
[1:21:04] walking down the road he said I was
[1:21:06] walking down the road and he said I was
[1:21:07] kind of skipping along and shadowboxing
[1:21:09] as it were he said I was kind of
[1:21:11] shadowboxing and he set up on that road
[1:21:13] came on died he said out came a black
[1:21:16] dog running out from behind me and he's
[1:21:18] saying that came up from me and he said
[1:21:20] he made like he was going to bite me he
[1:21:22] said when he did he said I kicked at him
[1:21:24] and said get away you talk he said but
[1:21:26] when I said that that dog turned into a
[1:21:29] tall dark looking fellow that was
[1:21:32] dressed in black and that man grounded
[1:21:34] him and he said I'm going to kill you
[1:21:37] and brother Bantam said in the vision he
[1:21:39] said now I'm sorry sir I thought you
[1:21:42] were a dog I thought you were
[1:21:45] I'm sorry I didn't mean to call you a
[1:21:47] dog and that man screamed at him I'm
[1:21:50] going to kill you
[1:21:52] I'm going to kill you and he said that
[1:21:55] man backed him up against the culvert on
[1:21:58] that road backed him up against the
[1:22:00] culvert on that road and grounded him
[1:22:03] and he said I'm going to kill you
[1:22:05] brother Bantam said I said in the vision
[1:22:07] I said in the vision now sir I'm not
[1:22:11] afraid to die Jesus Christ is my
[1:22:14] strength Jesus Christ is my protection
[1:22:16] and he said that man drove for that
[1:22:19] knife that he had like a saber blade he
[1:22:22] drove back and he said when he did there
[1:22:25] was a noise as it came from heaven and
[1:22:28] there came a mighty angel come and stood
[1:22:30] by my side and looked sternly at that
[1:22:33] man hallelujah
[1:22:35] look sternly at that man that man
[1:22:37] dropped his knife and moved back and
[1:22:40] took off running as hard as he could go
[1:22:43] now I know that that was stealing
[1:22:46] pertaining successfully with brother
[1:22:48] branham's the healing of his body but I
[1:22:50] want to tell you tonight Church of the
[1:22:51] Living God that there's a mighty angel
[1:22:53] that standing here and that dark spirit
[1:22:58] that's followed you of sickness that's
[1:23:00] followed you with diseases that's
[1:23:02] followed you with all of those things
[1:23:03] there's a mighty angel here to look
[1:23:06] sternly on that devil and they can't
[1:23:09] drop his knife and make him run
[1:23:20] hello church were here it's not coming
[1:23:26] he said you remember he said now there's
[1:23:28] been Church to search this bronze bronze
[1:23:30] but there's got to come one
[1:23:31] we're here we're here we're not looking
[1:23:34] for signs those signs are following us
[1:23:37] you remember we're a couple days ago
[1:23:39] when brother on how to win up to brother
[1:23:41] Eric since he normally goes in the fall
[1:23:44] time but this time they set up a meeting
[1:23:47] in May and they're in that meeting on
[1:23:49] the Sunday movie sisters sister Martha
[1:23:52] Eriksson I believe it's brother Eric's
[1:23:53] install her and came into the prayer
[1:23:56] line had been bit by tick and got Lyme
[1:23:58] disease and she was bound to a
[1:24:00] wheelchair you remember the story she
[1:24:02] was bailed to a wheelchair and they rode
[1:24:05] her a player she's second one I believe
[1:24:06] in the prayer line comes a player and
[1:24:09] all of a sudden that came that came a
[1:24:11] strength from God and she stood up but
[1:24:13] God wasn't finished yet brother on spoke
[1:24:16] to her say these words I will live and
[1:24:19] not die three times and when she spoke
[1:24:21] those things there came a wind that came
[1:24:24] a wind into that place and sister Martha
[1:24:27] started shouting all over the building
[1:24:29] what was it it was showing that God is
[1:24:32] Almighty that I am the lord that heals
[1:24:36] all of your diseases that there's
[1:24:38] nothing too hard for me no matter what
[1:24:40] you got no matter what you name it no
[1:24:43] matter what you call it i am the lord
[1:24:45] that heals you all of your diseases
[1:24:47] [Applause]
[1:24:49] we're here now you can make out your
[1:24:54] plans when you're going on vacation you
[1:24:57] can try to plan every little restaurant
[1:24:58] you're going to eat you're going to try
[1:25:00] to plan out where you going to do this
[1:25:02] certain things and there's gonna be
[1:25:03] plans that get messed up but there's not
[1:25:06] one plan of God that's been messed up
[1:25:09] just because you're in a certain
[1:25:11] situation does not change your
[1:25:13] predestination
[1:25:14] [Applause]
[1:25:20] hallelujah
[1:25:23] good to have y'all back now the Bible
[1:25:27] says here in Psalms 119 and 89 that
[1:25:32] forever O Lord thy word is settled in
[1:25:34] heaven thy faithfulness is unto all
[1:25:38] generations so he's still speaking to
[1:25:41] you
[1:25:42] thy faithfulness is unto all generations
[1:25:45] thou has to establish the earth and it
[1:25:48] abideth they continue this day according
[1:25:51] to that ordinance where all are thy
[1:25:54] servants the moon the stars all are his
[1:25:58] servants they continue to this day
[1:26:02] according to his ordinances now notice
[1:26:05] what the psalmist says unless the law
[1:26:09] had been my delights I should have
[1:26:12] perished in my affliction now think
[1:26:14] about that
[1:26:15] I think about a person it goes through a
[1:26:17] trial or goes through affliction that
[1:26:19] does not have the Lord and here the
[1:26:21] psalmist is telling you exactly that
[1:26:23] that unless the word of God have been is
[1:26:28] the light I should have perished in my
[1:26:30] affliction but I will never forget thy
[1:26:33] precepts for with them thou hast made me
[1:26:37] alive
[1:26:38] thou has quickened me with thy precepts
[1:26:41] now notice here in verse 18 on that word
[1:26:45] settled his render it means to set it
[1:26:49] means to put the place and then
[1:26:51] understanding the cause to set up it's
[1:26:53] settled it's stable I love it it's
[1:27:01] stable when you look at the children of
[1:27:04] God and you look at all their battles
[1:27:06] and you look at all their ups and downs
[1:27:07] it still did not change they went
[1:27:11] through some stuff you think you going
[1:27:14] through some stuff but they went through
[1:27:15] some stuff it did not change what the
[1:27:19] word said about them it did not change
[1:27:22] what God had spoke it was
[1:27:25] settled look past what you see are you
[1:27:29] with me so whose report are you going to
[1:27:32] believe are you with me
[1:27:36] you can believe the doctors report and
[1:27:38] that puts you in a grave or you can
[1:27:40] believe God's report and he'll bring out
[1:27:42] the green you see Satan is the author of
[1:27:47] confusion and the father of lies I do
[1:27:49] not want to believe in Lahaina be damned
[1:27:51] but I want to follow the prince of life
[1:27:53] the Prince of Peace the king of kings
[1:27:56] and the Lord of lords lobotomist a nerd
[1:28:11] I found this it's not it's not very very
[1:28:15] long when I come across this today I
[1:28:18] became so overwhelmed in my study that
[1:28:22] all I could do was cry mother bear I'm
[1:28:25] standing there in Zurich Switzerland
[1:28:26] he's in 1955 in a sermon Abraham he said
[1:28:30] not of you people that are along here
[1:28:33] sitting in these chairs and stretchers
[1:28:35] God loves you
[1:28:39] to me that's enough to me that's enough
[1:28:45] no matter matter what you go through God
[1:28:50] loves you no matter how good you feel
[1:28:54] God loves you no matter how bad you feel
[1:28:57] God loves you your people are here that
[1:29:00] are there longer here sitting in these
[1:29:02] chairs and stretchers God loves you now
[1:29:06] I could have walked out if I'm saying
[1:29:07] that mean I could've walked out right
[1:29:08] there I said thank you he said but no
[1:29:13] matter what is wrong with you if he's
[1:29:16] Almighty God he can do all things and if
[1:29:20] he can do all things if he cannot do all
[1:29:23] things then he is not Almighty God the
[1:29:27] brother Adam comes right behind this and
[1:29:30] he says there's not been a night when
[1:29:32] somebody's not got out of those
[1:29:34] wheelchairs or stretchers
[1:29:37] see God was coming behind it and
[1:29:39] vindicating it that he is see God no
[1:29:44] matter what's wrong with you
[1:29:45] God loves you close your Bible you can
[1:29:50] leave I don't know who it's for but God
[1:29:54] wants to tell you he loves you I love it
[1:30:00] I love being able to tell my wife I love
[1:30:04] her but when she tells me she loves me
[1:30:08] boy it does something to me but when God
[1:30:13] tells me God it's enough now the Bible
[1:30:23] says in Psalms 105 and 37 they're
[1:30:26] speaking when Israel had left Egypt he
[1:30:32] now the Bible says verse 37 II that he
[1:30:34] brought them forth also with silver and
[1:30:37] gold and there was not one feeble person
[1:30:41] among their tribes woo and there was not
[1:30:47] one feeble person among their tribes now
[1:30:51] if you look at it you'll see that there
[1:30:54] were six hundred men that were there and
[1:30:57] we know by theology and look at the
[1:30:59] history by what brother Branham said
[1:31:01] that there was two to three million
[1:31:03] people that were in the tribes of Israel
[1:31:06] that came out I love Egypt but when they
[1:31:10] came out there was not one feeble person
[1:31:13] among their tribes now if that was true
[1:31:18] for Israel under the law how much more
[1:31:21] true is that for you you that have been
[1:31:24] redeemed by the precious blood of the
[1:31:26] Lamb of God let this become a settled
[1:31:29] thought for you
[1:31:30] a settled truth for you that he is the
[1:31:32] Lord that heals all of your diseases
[1:31:35] that were soso means salvation it is not
[1:31:39] too different atonements it's the same
[1:31:42] atonement the same otomí that saved you
[1:31:44] it's the same otomí the hill
[1:31:46] the same otomí the hills you is the same
[1:31:49] atonement that delivers you hallelujah
[1:31:55] in the Old Testament two million people
[1:31:57] let's say 2 million people of God's
[1:32:00] people believed his word and it was
[1:32:03] spoken and every one of them was
[1:32:05] completely healed you remember what
[1:32:12] brother Brent said let's take a look at
[1:32:14] Moses of script back what was it what
[1:32:17] was it I am the Lord that heals all of
[1:32:20] your diseases you see two million people
[1:32:24] believed that's the only reason those
[1:32:27] Israelites became well and strong was
[1:32:30] that they believed what God said
[1:32:33] you see if you believe what God said you
[1:32:36] can speak what God has said hallelujah
[1:32:40] that when you're walking through the
[1:32:42] darkness of Alex I will fear no evil Wow
[1:32:46] for thou art with me thy rod and thy
[1:32:48] staff they cook for me he's with you
[1:32:52] Church one scripture but we need a whole
[1:33:01] bundle of them is that Alright
[1:33:04] so many times we get so cast down but
[1:33:08] we're not destroyed but so many times I
[1:33:10] think search it over I got such an over
[1:33:13] they had one scripture they held on to
[1:33:16] that one scripture and Moses took the
[1:33:19] brass Serpent and set it before them and
[1:33:22] every one of them that looked on that
[1:33:24] brass serpent looked and lived why
[1:33:26] because there was an angel of healing
[1:33:29] that was on that pole hallelujah do you
[1:33:32] believe that there's a healing angel
[1:33:35] that is still here
[1:33:37] he's still here you remember with other
[1:33:41] lamps off of that little girl who down
[1:33:43] there that blind girl had those
[1:33:44] cataracts and she lost her daddy and
[1:33:46] she's going around there and when there
[1:33:48] was a time of crisis of racism like
[1:33:51] never before
[1:33:52] and they were separating them
[1:33:54] White's world miss not blacks were on
[1:33:55] that side but yet there was a profit
[1:33:58] that walked over there on that side and
[1:34:02] he heard her screaming daddy daddy he
[1:34:04] said what's wrong with you honey she
[1:34:06] said I can't find my daddy I came here
[1:34:09] to see my healer I heard about that man
[1:34:11] from Kent in Missouri that was blinding
[1:34:13] his eyes and was completely made whole
[1:34:15] and brother Balaam said I played the
[1:34:17] part of a hypocrite for a minute he said
[1:34:19] do you believe that there's an angel of
[1:34:22] healing that is coming this generation
[1:34:24] she said yes I do if you get me to the
[1:34:29] healer I'll find my daddy oh if we could
[1:34:33] just get to the healer tonight it's not
[1:34:35] to get to brother on not to get to
[1:34:37] brother Branham not to get to brother
[1:34:39] Andrew not to get to brother to him not
[1:34:41] to give to brother Bisco not to get to
[1:34:44] brother Regan
[1:34:44] but to get to the healer I'm not just
[1:34:48] talking about physical healing I'm
[1:34:50] talking about mind healing spiritual
[1:34:52] healing Oh body healing you really
[1:35:00] believe there's an angel of healing come
[1:35:04] to this generation well if he's still
[1:35:07] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:35:09] that means he's here so if he's here I
[1:35:13] can expect him to do the same thing that
[1:35:15] had done then right now Alleluia
[1:35:23] notice in acts 5 8 and 5 that when
[1:35:27] Philip went down to the city of Samaria
[1:35:29] and preached Christ on them
[1:35:31] notice what he preached Christ and the
[1:35:34] people with one Accord gave heed to
[1:35:37] those things which Philips fake hearing
[1:35:39] and seeing the miracles which he did for
[1:35:42] unclean spirits crying with a loud voice
[1:35:44] came out many that were possessed with
[1:35:47] them and many taken with policies and
[1:35:49] that were lame were healed and there was
[1:35:52] great joy in that city Jesus proved he
[1:35:58] proved that he was exactly the same God
[1:36:01] working through Philip when Philip went
[1:36:04] down there preached Christ
[1:36:06] Jesus was so and that he's still the
[1:36:08] same and if Jesus is preached in the
[1:36:11] same it's gotta be received as the same
[1:36:13] I wonder fares are people that's willing
[1:36:17] to receive a Christ that heals a price i
[1:36:21] Christ that delivers a Christ that sets
[1:36:23] free the early church tapped into a
[1:36:31] channel they tapped into a channel and

[1:37:25] it's hurting Satan's Kingdom so let's
[1:37:29] just give it to him let's stop a mud
[1:37:31] hole in him that I review country talk
[1:37:34] okay with you that's what you go get
[1:37:38] country talk we know
[1:37:42] second Corinthians 4 and 13 says that we
[1:37:45] have in the same spirit of faith
[1:37:47] according as it is written written I
[1:37:50] believed and therefore have I spoken we
[1:37:53] also believe in therefore speak so when
[1:37:56] a believer is standing in his position
[1:37:59] he stands there in the opposition of all
[1:38:03] things
[1:38:04] against all odds he stands firm because
[1:38:07] he's a believer and he stands there with
[1:38:10] that badge of authority on him knowing
[1:38:13] that it's not the name of the nomination
[1:38:15] nor the name of a church but it is
[1:38:18] resurrection of Jesus Christ personally
[1:38:21] in an individual life you know you know
[1:38:26] that police officer can stand down there
[1:38:28] stand down there at that roadside and he
[1:38:31] can stand there with that badge and he's
[1:38:34] got the authority to stop cars and pull
[1:38:36] over cars and do things because he has
[1:38:40] the badge of authority home you see what
[1:38:43] he says the whole city is behind him he
[1:38:46] ain't got no power to stop him cars down
[1:38:48] there he ain't got the power to stop a
[1:38:50] tractor-trailer Deborah might look like
[1:38:52] it but he can't stop a tractor-trailer
[1:38:54] but he's got the authority to do that
[1:38:57] that's what the believer does when they
[1:39:00] stand in their position they stand there
[1:39:03] and they have the authority to do so in
[1:39:06] the name of Jesus Christ and that is why
[1:39:09] Satan is so upset tonight that we don't
[1:39:12] come to him with power but we come to
[1:39:14] him with the authority the baptism of
[1:39:16] the Holy Ghost and Satan goes to
[1:39:18] screaming and goes to hollering because
[1:39:20] you are in your authority that police
[1:39:26] officer ain't got no strength in his own
[1:39:28] ain't got no hand got no power in his
[1:39:31] own to do it but he's got the authority
[1:39:34] to do that
