[42:34] about these meetings and we are here and
[42:36] we are so thankful how that we realize
[42:39] that God has set up this moment in time
[42:41] and we realize that the Lord has allowed
[42:44] us to be a part of this eternal moment
[42:47] in time and we just want to appreciate
[42:49] all of our brothers and sisters the the
[42:51] efforts to be here I know brother
[42:53] mcclard's family is here and we just
[42:54] want to say God richly bless you and

[42:59] he's quite he's quite a uh a great
[43:03] addition here at Full Gospel Lighthouse
[43:05] there's a lot we could say there brother
[43:06] but we just won't say it at this moment
[43:08] so we just we certainly appreciate you
[43:11] being here with us this weekend and
[43:13] anybody anybody that knows knows so but
[43:16] we are so thankful and honored to have
[43:18] the whole entire Ray family here with us
[43:20] and uh we just want to just say God
[43:23] bless you all for being here brother Tom
[43:25] and brother Michael we have we have
[43:27] prayed much about these meetings and uh
[43:29] may we just say it like this that our
[43:31] expectation is at Max Capacity we are
[43:35] such under an an an anticipation for the
[43:39] Supernatural and I believe that this
[43:41] this weekend is going to be extra
[43:44] special and that word just kept coming
[43:46] to my heart about this weekend in
[43:48] particular and I I look that up and it
[43:51] it means a distinguished by some unusual
[43:55] quality being in some way
[43:58] Superior and I believe that this weekend
[44:00] is going to be just that it will be
[44:03] unusual in quality that our Lord Jesus
[44:06] that's how he does things brother
[44:07] brandham said in thirston for life he
[44:09] said I pray thee most holy God and
[44:11] Father that you will visit us tonight in
[44:14] a most unusual way we are not those
[44:17] people who have to have Miracles we do
[44:20] not seek after Miracles are signed but
[44:23] it's because that the word must be
[44:25] fulfilled it is WR written in the Bible
[44:27] that Jesus did those things that the
[44:29] word might be fulfilled the Gentile
[44:32] generation is receiving its last call
[44:34] the world is receiving its last call and
[44:36] we feel God that you're near to move and
[44:39] to manifest your love in this evening
[44:41] light and we'll pray that you'll do it
[44:45] am that's our prayer tonight is that God
[44:47] would do the supernatural that the
[44:48] evening light will shine in this place
[44:51] in such a specific way I saw brother
[44:53] Joey Terry I believe that the evening
[44:54] light is shining so bright sister
[44:56] brother Joey Terry and sister Faith
[44:58] their their daughter was back there
[44:59] wearing sunglasses at the evening light
[45:01] is that it's that
[45:04] powerful you know Satan has fought us on
[45:07] all angles in this meeting to be here
[45:09] and we have arrived in such a time as
[45:11] this and I I I don't believe in giving
[45:14] up and I don't believe in giving an inch
[45:16] but I believe that we are in a spot
[45:17] where we're going to have the unusual
[45:19] and we're going to have the special
[45:21] right here amongst us I believe that
[45:23] it's a time where sons are going to
[45:25] manifest themselves that the unus usual
[45:27] will be shown right here amongst us and
[45:30] and I believe that if we come expecting
[45:32] the unusual that we can have an unusual
[45:34] Upper Room experience that we could we
[45:37] could realize that sons of God can walk
[45:39] out in bravery just like they did 2,000
[45:41] years ago and they can turn down the
[45:43] devil's achievements and his
[45:46] advancements and I believe that if you
[45:48] come under that kind of an anticipation
[45:51] that young people can receive the
[45:52] baptism of the Holy Ghost and I believe
[45:54] that that healings will take place I
[45:56] believe Al Capia will leave people right
[45:59] here in the midst of the house of the
[46:01] Lord Jesus Christ I believe that cancer
[46:03] will leave and I I believe that young
[46:05] people can receive a supernatural
[46:07] unusual experience by the by a birth and
[46:10] I believe that we're going to rise up
[46:12] and turn down the devil's lies and I
[46:14] know it's a paradox but it's
[46:17] true it's true that we can believe these
[46:19] things it's true that we can have these
[46:21] things and I I just want you to know
[46:23] that right here right now that the
[46:25] miracle that you're needing is in the
[46:28] room and I'll just I'll just put it this
[46:30] literal just now brother Michael and
[46:33] brother Tom have come with that kind of
[46:36] miraculous Ministry to produce the uh
[46:39] the everliving God right here before us
[46:42] brother Michael holds a very special
[46:44] spot in my heart brother Tom a a great
[46:47] part in my heart these men of God to the
[46:50] Spencer family and to Full Gospel
[46:52] Lighthouse we are indebted to the ray
[46:54] family in their Ministries and we have
[46:57] seen how the Lord has raised up our
[46:59] brother Michael and used him in a very
[47:01] unusual way and God has given him a
[47:03] Ministry to to bless the kingdom of God
[47:06] in this time and I'll just be honest
[47:09] he's more than a friend to me he's one
[47:10] of my best friends here on this Earth
[47:12] and God has molded our connection
[47:15] together in such a way that I I believe
[47:18] that God's going to do something very
[47:20] special here tonight are you under that
[47:23] kind of anticipation and expectation I
[47:26] know there's Brothers and sisters that
[47:27] can't be here tonight but I I just want
[47:30] to ask that God would give them
[47:33] compensation for our brother baton and
[47:35] brother Delaney that are in the hospital
[47:36] that would so be here they wouldn't miss
[47:39] these services but Satan has threw up a
[47:41] blockade but I believe our God is not
[47:43] going to allow Satan to block the
[47:46] visitation that he has for every single
[47:48] one of us so as brother Michael prepares
[47:50] to come I want you to I want you to put
[47:52] on your spiritual helmets and I want you
[47:54] to pull on the gift of God and I I
[47:57] believe that God's going to do the
[47:58] special right here tonight amongst us
[48:00] would you stand with us this evening
[48:03] maybe the Kia beat sister

[52:58] Lord you could accomplish that which
[53:00] you've desired to do tonight Lord an
[53:03] appointed moment somebody maybe walked

[53:07] into the presence of almighty God and
[53:09] they're going to walk out a completely
[53:10] different person Lord they didn't know

[55:28] that down by the power of God your heart
[55:30] is set on that it says yes by his

[55:40] it Lord Brother Bram says we prayed for

[56:07] got double power yes Triple Power yes
[56:10] four times power yes first thing you
[56:12] know it becomes thousands powers of yes
[56:16] he says then the holy spirit moves in
[56:19] and confirms the word of God with signs
[56:21] and wonders following that's it that's
[56:23] what we need expectation I said tonight
[56:27] Lord may it be thousands power yes

[56:39] your need tonight amen amen a thousand
[56:42] power yes tonight in the
[56:44] building amen and then the holy spirit
[56:47] moves in Psalm
[56:50] 77 verse
[56:52] two in the day of my trouble I sought
[56:56] the Lord my sore ran in the night and
[56:59] ceased not and my soul refused to be
[57:02] comforted I remembered God and was
[57:04] troubled I complained and my spirit was
[57:07] overwhelmed CA thou holdest mine eyes
[57:11] waking I am so troubl that I cannot
[57:13] speak I've considered the days of old
[57:15] the years of ancient times I call to
[57:17] remembrance my song of the night I
[57:19] commune with my own heart and my spirit
[57:22] made diligent search will the Lord cast
[57:25] off forever and will he be favorable no
[57:27] more is his Mercy clean Gone Forever
[57:31] does his promise fail forever more hath
[57:34] God forgotten to be gracious hath he in
[57:38] Anger shut up his Tender
[57:40] Mercies
[57:42] CA what a passage of
[57:45] scripture David crying out Lord have you
[57:49] forgotten to be
[57:51] gracious had he shut up his Tender
[57:54] Mercies
[57:56] and I'm going to leave you right
[57:58] there and in
[58:00] Matthew 15:21 you can turn if you can
[58:04] fairly
[58:14] quickly then Jesus went then and
[58:17] departed into the coasts of Ty and siden
[58:20] and behold a woman of Canaan came out of
[58:22] the same coast and Cried unto him saying
[58:25] have mer mercy on me oh Lord thou son of
[58:27] David my daughter is grievously vexed
[58:30] with the
[58:31] devil but he answered
[58:34] her not a
[58:37] word I'm going to stop it right there as
[58:39] well may the Lord have bless his word
[58:41] this evening you may have your
[58:45] seats I'm going to preach a service
[58:47] tonight if I could title it a little bit
[58:49] and if the Lord can just give me liberty
[58:52] I'm going to title it tonight the
[58:54] silence is over Hallelujah
[58:57] the silence is over silence is an
[59:02] awkward time for some because in this
[59:05] world it's a it's a very busy world it's
[59:07] filled with a lot of noise and often
[59:10] silence is a is a word that we that we
[59:13] that has maybe a bit of a negative
[59:15] connotation to it uh we have
[59:17] conspiracies of Silence even somebody in
[59:20] their uh maybe in a relationship with
[59:22] somebody they might give them the silent
[59:24] treatment or maybe we lift the veil of
[59:27] Silence it's a it's a term that
[59:29] sometimes is it's not generally used or
[59:32] or has a good uh feel to it and in our
[59:35] busy noisy world people fear in some
[59:39] cases silence because it's filled with
[59:41] the unknown right you go in a room and
[59:44] and everybody just goes silent it
[59:45] actually gets uncomfortable generally
[59:48] and people then try to fidget they're
[59:50] trying to figure out how do we fill the
[59:51] void of space and because some people
[59:53] don't actually want to be left in
[59:55] silence because what happens is they're
[59:56] left there with their own thoughts and
[59:59] often people's own thoughts they might
[1:00:01] not want to go down that road they they
[1:00:03] want to they maybe got some situations
[1:00:05] and and such that they just want to
[1:00:07] drown out their their their inner world
[1:00:10] or their problems and so they keep it
[1:00:11] busy because in that silent time you get
[1:00:14] driven to maybe a place where you have
[1:00:15] to come and confront what really
[1:00:18] matters and so the world fills our our
[1:00:22] our our world really with noise but we
[1:00:24] know that God doesn't generally work
[1:00:25] work the noise we know of course because
[1:00:27] we're Bible readers we know that Elijah
[1:00:29] he didn't God didn't speak through an
[1:00:31] earthquake he didn't speak through the
[1:00:32] great fire and the great wind but he
[1:00:33] spoke in a still Small Voice if we could
[1:00:36] say in the Silence of it the quietness
[1:00:38] of it and so the world is geared to
[1:00:40] really push that out to squelch the
[1:00:42] ability to hear that sty that silent or
[1:00:44] that still voice and so God doesn't seem
[1:00:47] that doesn't work necessarily in the
[1:00:49] noise of the world and sometimes it
[1:00:51] seems in the silence that God has
[1:00:53] rejected you it seems like he's turned
[1:00:56] to his his his eye aside as we can read
[1:00:59] the scripture at the beginning in Psalms
[1:01:01] will the Lord cast off forever or will
[1:01:03] he be favorable no more and is is his
[1:01:05] Mercy clean Gone Forever David is crying
[1:01:08] out in in a Psalm does his promise fail
[1:01:11] forever more question mark he was in a
[1:01:14] silent period God it seemed like God had
[1:01:18] completely gone silent on David's
[1:01:20] situation and he cried out at God
[1:01:22] forgotten to be gracious and there he
[1:01:24] penned the words down and brother bradam
[1:01:26] says there in in a quote he said it
[1:01:28] seemed like a black sheet began to
[1:01:31] unfold coming down as if God had took my
[1:01:35] prayer and thrw it back in my
[1:01:38] face my goodness and he says Lord what
[1:01:40] have I done have I transgressed your
[1:01:42] laws that I should have this punishment
[1:01:44] is if it is just reveal it to me I'll
[1:01:47] repent and he's crying out oh God don't
[1:01:49] turn your face from me don't throw my
[1:01:51] prayer back in my face or drop like a
[1:01:53] sheet in front of me if there's anything
[1:01:55] I did please please tell me please I
[1:01:57] want to repent for it surely I want to
[1:01:58] see your face I need to hear your
[1:02:01] voice but it
[1:02:03] seemed like God had turned his face on
[1:02:06] him and at that moment the tempter came
[1:02:11] in the tempter he said came to me and
[1:02:13] there was one time in all my life that I
[1:02:15] can call was The crucial moment he says
[1:02:19] my geeman when I was just barely holding
[1:02:22] on to the bed the devil said there you
[1:02:24] are it's in that silent moment Satan
[1:02:27] says all right here's my opportunity I'm
[1:02:29] just going to step in at this moment and
[1:02:31] say see there you are is his mercies
[1:02:34] gone from you are they clean gone look

[1:02:39] your prayer has he even heard what you
[1:02:41] said he's completely turned his head his
[1:02:43] ear from you he's gone silent and he's
[1:02:45] rejected
[1:02:47] you there brother Brown says was his
[1:02:49] crucial moment when I was just barely
[1:02:51] holding to the bed and the devil said
[1:02:53] there you are that's your reward for
[1:02:55] trying to to serve him you mean he'll
[1:02:57] take you that take that young
[1:02:58] 22-year-old mother and lay her Yonder as
[1:03:00] a corpse in the morg and take that
[1:03:02] precious baby and slam your prayer right
[1:03:04] in your face and then you mean you to to
[1:03:06] serve
[1:03:09] him oh you've been through not your
[1:03:12] situations you mean to go through this
[1:03:14] trial you mean you had this situation
[1:03:16] you mean your family member went here
[1:03:18] they rejected the message here you mean
[1:03:20] you went through this this sickness
[1:03:21] there come on and you think you're going
[1:03:22] to serve God this way he's G to silent
[1:03:24] on you
[1:03:27] on brother Bram says I was standing
[1:03:29] between opinion it had to be decided
[1:03:31] there and you've been there you've stood
[1:03:33] between two opinions Satan calling at
[1:03:35] you saying he's rejected you boy why
[1:03:37] don't you just turn away and start
[1:03:38] living the way you should live and on
[1:03:40] the other side you're saying no no
[1:03:42] that's not where my heart is I can't
[1:03:43] agree with that and brother brandham
[1:03:44] says I was standing there and I put my
[1:03:46] hand over on that little head and I said
[1:03:48] the lord gave and the Lord takes away
[1:03:51] blessed be the name of the Lord what was
[1:03:53] he doing he went back to the word to
[1:03:56] draw on relief at this silent
[1:04:00] Tower the word is your refuge and
[1:04:03] brother Bren started to draw strength
[1:04:05] from another that had gone through a
[1:04:08] silent
[1:04:09] moment because there was job in
[1:04:14] silence oh that my grief were thoroughly
[1:04:16] weighed and my Calamity laid in the
[1:04:18] balances for now it would be heavier
[1:04:20] than the sand of the sea therefore my
[1:04:22] words are swallowed up for the arrows of
[1:04:24] the almighty are within me the poison
[1:04:26] wear of drinketh up my spirit the
[1:04:27] Terrors of God do set themselves in
[1:04:29] Array against me oh that I might have my
[1:04:31] request he says that God would grant me
[1:04:34] the one thing I long for even that it
[1:04:36] would please God to destroy me that he
[1:04:39] would lose his hand and cut me off job
[1:04:43] had been in
[1:04:49] silence job had no
[1:04:51] forewarning no preparation he had no
[1:04:54] leadup into the situation
[1:04:56] he God didn't be like job I need you for
[1:04:59] a moment I need to use you an example I
[1:05:01] need you to to raise you up and place
[1:05:03] you in scripture because there's going
[1:05:04] to be hundreds and thousands of my
[1:05:05] people of my sons and daughters that are
[1:05:07] going to draw from your situation I need
[1:05:09] you to stand strong job I need you to
[1:05:11] realize I'm going to take you through a
[1:05:13] difficult hour but you need to know that
[1:05:14] I'm with you he didn't do that he didn't
[1:05:18] do that he just job just had to walk and
[1:05:20] suddenly Calamity after Calamity after
[1:05:22] Calamity after Calamity Job saying
[1:05:24] what's going on my my oxen and my camels
[1:05:27] and this and that no
[1:05:29] forewarning and he went through
[1:05:32] silence it was so with job job was the
[1:05:35] best in the land best man God could find
[1:05:37] and yet look what happened to him he
[1:05:39] wasn't chastising him God wasn't trying
[1:05:41] him he wasn't he was proving to Satan he
[1:05:44] had somebody that would believe him in
[1:05:47] the face of difficult God needs somebody
[1:05:50] that can believe on him in the face of
[1:05:53] difficult so that somebody beside you
[1:05:54] can say if he went went through it if he
[1:05:56] went through it if she went through it
[1:05:58] in the face of all difficulty when God
[1:06:00] was silent I can still trust in
[1:06:04] him cuz somebody God needs you when your
[1:06:08] hour of needs someone's going to look at
[1:06:09] him and say if he went through such an
[1:06:12] hour and he can pull from scripture and
[1:06:16] say I know in who I have believed in and
[1:06:18] I'm
[1:06:22] persuaded spafford went through it those
[1:06:25] that know Rao spafford who wrote the
[1:06:27] song it as well where his daughters
[1:06:29] perished his son earlier properties were
[1:06:31] destroyed and he came to the
[1:06:34] ocean there's no voice telling on Artio
[1:06:37] I need you to go through this because I
[1:06:38] need you to be inspired because you're
[1:06:40] going to write a song that's going to be
[1:06:43] sung down Through the Ages when peace
[1:06:47] like a river a 10 is my way when Sorrows
[1:06:51] like sea Billows roll whatever my lot
[1:06:54] thou has taught me to say It is Well it
[1:06:57] Is Well with My Soul no Horatio didn't
[1:07:00] get a heads up warning he didn't wasn't
[1:07:02] pre-old what was going to happen but in
[1:07:04] the Silence of the hour he could well up
[1:07:06] and say oh God it Is Well with My
[1:07:11] Soul and something welled up from
[1:07:15] job you think what job went through I
[1:07:17] don't even have time to go into the
[1:07:18] details of it but you go read your first
[1:07:20] few chapters of job and realize as the
[1:07:23] servant was speaking as the servant was
[1:07:24] speaking as the the servant was speaking
[1:07:26] instantaneously each situation came as
[1:07:29] his life started to crumble and go down
[1:07:31] but through all of that and God didn't
[1:07:34] speak to him and tell them all and
[1:07:35] pre-prep him but what happened he said
[1:07:38] oh that my words were now written oh
[1:07:40] that they were printed in a book for
[1:07:42] they were Graven with an iron pen and
[1:07:44] lad in rock forever for I know that my
[1:07:47] redeemer
[1:07:49] liveth what a revelation that was when
[1:07:53] job through all the turmoil through the
[1:07:55] silence he could say wait a second devil
[1:07:58] I know in whom I have believed My
[1:08:00] Redeemer liveth and I'll see him and
[1:08:02] shall stand at the latter day and though
[1:08:04] my skin worms destroy this body yet in
[1:08:07] my flesh I shall see
[1:08:12] God in its
[1:08:14] silence look what God was
[1:08:16] forming in the silence God actually
[1:08:20] created and formed a vessel to cry out
[1:08:25] and tend the words oh that my words were
[1:08:29] written they were job they were
[1:08:32] written so that every one of us could
[1:08:36] reach into that
[1:08:37] inspiration in our silent
[1:08:45] moments God
[1:08:47] often Through the Ages has foretold
[1:08:50] events used His
[1:08:52] prophets but in the moment
[1:08:57] as it's
[1:08:58] manifesting it's a silent event I'll
[1:09:03] explain this because I'm always amazed
[1:09:06] and I'll use a vision that brother
[1:09:07] Brenham had of the green checkered
[1:09:10] shirt that was
[1:09:12] told in detail before it transpired and
[1:09:17] the prophet would go and and and go
[1:09:19] through the very details and describe it
[1:09:21] as the events would move forward and all
[1:09:23] the different aspects of it were clearly
[1:09:25] outlaid of what was going to transpire
[1:09:27] he didn't know where but he just was
[1:09:29] telling what God had showed him and so
[1:09:31] we know before the hunt the detail the
[1:09:33] details of the account of the vision
[1:09:35] were outlaid and the Caribou that would
[1:09:37] be shot and and there would be some
[1:09:38] small fellows there and there'd be a
[1:09:40] measuring tape measuring 42 in and
[1:09:42] there'd be a green checkered shirt there
[1:09:44] and there was a grizzly bear and it was
[1:09:46] shot and all these details were laid out
[1:09:48] very clearly as they were outlined of
[1:09:50] what would take place even a certain
[1:09:53] shirt that was really believed to be in
[1:09:54] the garbage it wasn't supposed to even
[1:09:56] exist essentially but their natural
[1:09:58] events were were were in your mind were
[1:10:00] going one way but God had a very
[1:10:02] different thing outlined and planned
[1:10:04] Blain That was supposed to be uh wasn't
[1:10:06] even supposed to be there was was then
[1:10:08] present and and and certain things
[1:10:10] started to transpire as brother Ed began
[1:10:12] to come to the place of a hunt and he
[1:10:16] started to poke wow Blain I thought you
[1:10:20] weren't supposed to be here but he was
[1:10:24] oh so he logged that that interesting
[1:10:27] and so he would he would kind of have
[1:10:28] brother brandham tell the story actually
[1:10:30] a couple times to to throughout the
[1:10:32] journey think one to his dad then to
[1:10:34] brother Bud Southwick prior to the
[1:10:35] vision and so there was a looking
[1:10:37] forward to what God had had outlaid and
[1:10:39] what was God what was God was going to
[1:10:41] do and so he's he's there pre prevision
[1:10:45] I could
[1:10:49] say but little did he know that he was
[1:10:53] actually walking
[1:10:55] in
[1:10:56] it he didn't real he was poking at the
[1:10:59] beginning and and and didn't maybe
[1:11:00] didn't really really realize but if I
[1:11:02] could say tonight if we could if we
[1:11:04] could prick our awareness a little bit
[1:11:06] and realize that maybe could we tonight
[1:11:08] be walking in something that God has
[1:11:10] pre-ordained to happen and we didn't
[1:11:12] have we don't have a prophet to tell you
[1:11:14] what's going to happen tonight but God
[1:11:15] had a plan and a purpose baby you're
[1:11:18] walking with your prevision you're right
[1:11:21] there the beginnings of it is starting
[1:11:23] to transpire and you're not aware of it
[1:11:25] BR brother Ed they're trying to poke and
[1:11:31] prod I want to tell you tonight we're in
[1:11:35] the vision
[1:11:36] hallu we are in the vision brother
[1:11:39] brandham Cried Out stay in line I'm in
[1:11:42] that Vision I'm staying in line with the
[1:11:46] word of the hour I ain't moving left or
[1:11:47] right I'm not looking this way or that
[1:11:49] way I'm in the vision and I'm
[1:11:51] recognizing where I am God give us an
[1:11:54] awareness that this vision of this bride
[1:11:56] is in her place staying in
[1:11:59] line don't just think well I'm just
[1:12:01] going to church tonight no you're in a

[1:12:22] little shirt and she sat down at a chair
[1:12:24] somewh wearing a little table and she
[1:12:26] took out maybe green or white thread and
[1:12:28] she started to knit a shirt back or sew
[1:12:31] up a
[1:12:32] hole you say wow what's that that was
[1:12:35] actually a critical action to ensure
[1:12:39] that the vision came to full
[1:12:43] manifestation well I just I'm just going
[1:12:45] to sending my kids to school I'm just
[1:12:46] being a momm or I'm being a daddy no

[1:12:51] the revealing of Christ in this hour
[1:12:54] Hallelujah
[1:12:57] wasn't it just like a little lady who
[1:12:59] started to make some little cakes she
[1:13:00] had a little bit of meal left couple
[1:13:02] little sticks left and there she was
[1:13:04] going thinking she was going to die well
[1:13:06] my son's going to die I'm going to go
[1:13:07] make my very last
[1:13:10] meal but she didn't know that a prophet
[1:13:13] had been told you're going to see a lady
[1:13:16] she's going to do such and such she's
[1:13:18] going to make you a meal and she's going
[1:13:20] thinking I'm going to die my child's
[1:13:22] going to die I'm at The Bitter End God

[1:13:27] prayer my husband is gone I'm in a wreck
[1:13:30] of a tragedy my son is now dying of
[1:13:32] starvation I have one meal left that was

[1:13:43] through I don't know if you're like that
[1:13:44] little lady saying I'm at the end of my
[1:13:45] rope it looks like all's over but God
[1:13:47] has a different plan he has a different
[1:13:50] Vision he needs to make sure that it
[1:13:52] comes to manifestation he's given a word
[1:13:54] in this to is a Prophet spoke no go down
[1:13:57] she's got what you
[1:14:02] need in the unspiritual moments of her
[1:14:06] life she was actually fulfilling the
[1:14:10] vision in the Silence of
[1:14:15] God she was living it
[1:14:18] out should change our perspective a
[1:14:20] little
[1:14:21] bit on what we do on our day-to-day
[1:14:24] that's right actually what did you do
[1:14:25] today what did it actually fulfill and
[1:14:28] it just clicked and inched what God has
[1:14:32] has for you in store it just one more oh
[1:14:36] the measuring tape just it went in the
[1:14:38] bag God's like check green cheered shirt
[1:14:41] unbeknownst about her head got folded
[1:14:43] and packed
[1:14:45] check bla sorry we don't need you on the

[1:14:52] to get home early God's like you better
[1:14:54] get home early Jack I need you down
[1:14:57] there God's orchestrating events
[1:15:00] unbeknownst to you and I but he's making
[1:15:02] sure that you reach the end the expected
[1:15:05] end that he has for
[1:15:10] you God could have supplied that little
[1:15:13] W Widow of zarapas all he she needed she
[1:15:16] he could have just given her a
[1:15:17] sustenance he could have just said you
[1:15:19] know what she's prayed and and I could I
[1:15:21] could you know give her the food that
[1:15:22] she needs and such and such but he
[1:15:24] wanted to see what her faith would do
[1:15:28] God wanted to see he wanted to prove to
[1:15:29] the devil what job would do and stand
[1:15:31] there maybe God just saying I need to
[1:15:33] show the world that you will stand I
[1:15:36] need to show the world your faith will
[1:15:41] hold and
[1:15:42] nobody was shouting as now all the
[1:15:46] events started to come into
[1:15:48] place no one shouted out it's happening
[1:15:53] it's on the vision's begun
[1:15:55] no one did
[1:15:57] that I I I I find it interesting that at
[1:16:01] the beginning brother Ed was kind of
[1:16:02] prodding a little bit oh Blain is here
[1:16:05] and he he was kind of telling he was
[1:16:06] kind of aware and then actually when it
[1:16:09] starts to happen is aware of
[1:16:14] [Music]
[1:16:16] nothing the log God made was there made
[1:16:18] sure through his centuries of time had
[1:16:21] rotted in place so that whoever he
[1:16:23] tripped and fell on the water made sure
[1:16:24] that the Brook wasn't dry that it was
[1:16:25] wet so that he would get a wet shirt
[1:16:27] that would force him to go back to the
[1:16:28] tent and he's just struggling in in the
[1:16:30] natural events oh why did I fall and I'm
[1:16:33] sure he was all upset now he had to
[1:16:34] detach from the group brother brandom
[1:16:36] and all the brothers are there and I got
[1:16:37] to go back to the tent and change my
[1:16:38] shirt I'm just so frustrated right now I
[1:16:40] can imagine you're going through
[1:16:41] something of the same sort I don't know
[1:16:43] why do I have to do this why did this
[1:16:44] happen to me I'm just so frustrated
[1:16:46] what's happening in my but God's I got
[1:16:48] you in a vision
[1:16:58] there he goes and out he pulls out a
[1:17:01] shirt out of his bag that's green sheer
[1:17:03] and he says come on Ruth why did you
[1:17:06] pack that
[1:17:07] shirt I told you to throw it in the
[1:17:10] garbage right then button on the shirt
[1:17:13] what is he thinking about he's thinking
[1:17:15] about getting to the brothers that's all
[1:17:16] he's caring about I got to get where
[1:17:18] brother bam is and I get on the hunt and
[1:17:19] on he goes the green checkered
[1:17:22] shirt the most iconic aspect I could say
[1:17:25] maybe of that vision and he puts it on
[1:17:27] and he's wrapping himself in the
[1:17:36] vision what are you wrapping yourself
[1:17:39] with the word of this hour you're
[1:17:42] wrapping yourself robing yourself with
[1:17:44] the vision put it on you're going day by
[1:17:48] day you're sitting in your little hour
[1:17:50] you're going in prayer you're getting a
[1:17:52] message book you're going to the word
[1:17:54] what are you doing wrapping yourself in
[1:17:59] division
[1:18:01] Hallelujah it may seem silent but God
[1:18:04] give us an awareness of where we are in
[1:18:07] this
[1:18:12] hour God's ordained your life down to
[1:18:15] the
[1:18:17] letter yeah he said brother Michael I've
[1:18:19] heard that often you know God Don't Make
[1:18:21] Mistakes Etc I'm just telling you again
[1:18:24] it's been perfect perfectly
[1:18:26] ordained even in the mishaps even in the
[1:18:29] trips into the
[1:18:31] water unordained
[1:18:40] trip scripture
[1:18:46] says in Ephesians that he might sanctify
[1:18:49] and cleanse it with the washing of the
[1:18:50] water of the word that he might present
[1:18:52] to it himself a glor glorious church not
[1:18:56] having spot or wrinkle or any such thing
[1:19:00] but that it should be holy and without
[1:19:02] blemish who is
[1:19:07] that I'll
[1:19:10] identify who's who's speaking of that
[1:19:12] said well I'm going through such
[1:19:14] difficulty and I don't know about this
[1:19:15] and how am I get that Lord get me
[1:19:17] straight it seems like he hasn't talked
[1:19:18] to me but God in his word wrote that he
[1:19:21] would have a bride without blemish
[1:19:23] without spot without wrinkle he's going
[1:19:25] to ensure that she's
[1:19:29] there if he ensured that a vision would
[1:19:33] come out exactly as he had shown a
[1:19:35] prophet how much more the Bride of this
[1:19:38] hour God will ensure every single one
[1:19:42] will be
[1:19:47] there what I have such a problem brother
[1:19:51] Micha God I have this issue oh sorry
[1:19:53] sorry he said
[1:19:55] he's
[1:19:57] dead and it's happening right
[1:20:03] now and I hope you realize
[1:20:07] it how well that's not my problem how it
[1:20:14] happens and it might be in
[1:20:18] silence you might be in a silent hour
[1:20:22] but the vision still goes forward and
[1:20:26] will still manifest
[1:20:33] exactly because the word said though a
[1:20:35] host should encamp me encamp against me
[1:20:38] my heart shall not fear though War
[1:20:40] should rise against me in this will I be
[1:20:43] confident for in the time of trouble he
[1:20:45] shall hide me in his
[1:20:49] Pavilion what scripture was that for
[1:20:51] what message was that for rapture
[1:20:55] so God has already ordained to ensure
[1:20:59] there will be a people that he will hide
[1:21:02] in his
[1:21:07] Pavilion so if he said it he must do
[1:21:18] it and everything now that was required
[1:21:20] going back to the vision
[1:21:25] was already in place even when it wasn't
[1:21:26] even
[1:21:27] identified Blaine was not away in
[1:21:30] North it didn't really matter why or or
[1:21:33] who or what who why when where how he
[1:21:35] was there you don't need to be concerned
[1:21:37] with with how something's going to
[1:21:38] happen it'll just be there don't worry
[1:21:40] your brain about it don't build a bridge
[1:21:42] about it well I don't know how my my
[1:21:43] loved one's going to get saved I mean I
[1:21:45] mean time is coming so don't worry about
[1:21:46] it it'll they'll be there amen that's
[1:21:49] what don't don't worry about the the the
[1:21:50] part of it how did the measuring tapable
[1:21:52] get in the bag I don't know how it got
[1:21:53] in the bag but it got there
[1:21:55] it could have been translated from one
[1:21:56] point A to point B I don't know I don't
[1:21:58] care it was there amen where the shirt
[1:22:01] we know it got there somehow amen all
[1:22:03] those different aspects all happening
[1:22:07] silently they all happen silently they
[1:22:10] all transpired in some way to ensure
[1:22:14] that the mystery would actually become
[1:22:22] revealed I look at the vision that
[1:22:24] brother Bram had of the little baby with
[1:22:25] pneumonia and I'm going to go through
[1:22:27] this one rather
[1:22:29] quickly and we know that brother
[1:22:31] brandham goes through this de this
[1:22:32] account in quite detail actually and he
[1:22:35] races home and God shown him a vision
[1:22:37] about a baby that would be made well and
[1:22:39] he goes and praise and not everything's
[1:22:42] in place
[1:22:44] yet the events are not in order and the
[1:22:47] situation gets
[1:22:48] worse and sadness and
[1:22:52] mourning heaviness of heart the
[1:22:54] situation was Grim in the moment gloom
[1:22:59] and sorrow are
[1:23:03] prevalent everybody had lingered
[1:23:04] different ones that lingered there
[1:23:05] through the night you can go through the
[1:23:07] account and brother Bram speaks about it
[1:23:08] in experiences and visions of William
[1:23:10] brandom two different messages and other
[1:23:12] ones as well but and so they're all
[1:23:15] waiting there and they lingered and and
[1:23:17] Grandma comes over and she she says
[1:23:19] anything better and they say no and it
[1:23:22] falls crying and sobbing on her older
[1:23:24] and little did they know though little
[1:23:27] did they
[1:23:28] know
[1:23:29] moments
[1:23:31] moments the Fulfillment was just a
[1:23:34] matter of moments
[1:23:36] away you could just be in a situation
[1:23:38] and it all looks terrible and heaviness
[1:23:40] and sorrow and sadness and Gloom is it
[1:23:43] any better no ma it's it's gotten worse
[1:23:45] in fact and they start to cry and say oh
[1:23:47] my but there it was just a little bit
[1:23:49] further there was something going to
[1:23:51] happen it seemed that God was silent in
[1:23:53] the hour but if they just held on a
[1:23:55] little bit
[1:23:59] more because God was making sure this
[1:24:02] had to be in place this had to be in
[1:24:04] place this has to be there everything
[1:24:06] has to be in order there was an
[1:24:08] appointed
[1:24:11] moment it seemed like silence was going
[1:24:14] really going to be present for so for oh
[1:24:16] so long and the parents they looked and
[1:24:19] it looked like maybe God had gone silent
[1:24:21] he hasn't heard them he hasn't heard our
[1:24:22] prayer and even though prayer the
[1:24:24] prophet didn't make any result in fact
[1:24:26] it even seemed to get the situation
[1:24:29] worse butram says and I thought
[1:24:31] something was wrong why there's one
[1:24:33] person that wasn't in the house and
[1:24:34] nothing was in order and they they took
[1:24:36] the little baby over there it was just
[1:24:37] choking and brother brownon makes the
[1:24:39] sounds of Choke and the mother runs over
[1:24:41] and the father begin to work on it and
[1:24:42] puff on his nose and they both get to
[1:24:44] screaming and left the baby and brother
[1:24:46] Graham started working with it and just
[1:24:48] as blue as it could be it's little body
[1:24:50] laying stiff like that the lungs
[1:24:52] congested and folded up and pushed his
[1:24:54] little ribs like that what a desperate
[1:24:59] situation God haven't you heard our
[1:25:03] prayer you even told a prophet our baby
[1:25:05] would be well where are
[1:25:09] you they fought for life of the baby
[1:25:11] till daylight and daylight began to
[1:25:13] break they thought the baby would just
[1:25:14] go any minute any minute they kept
[1:25:18] asking brother brandham what must we do
[1:25:21] but Bill they called me what must we do
[1:25:23] he said I don't
[1:25:26] know I don't
[1:25:29] know according to the parents they'd
[1:25:31] been
[1:25:34] told but it just looked like everything
[1:25:36] went
[1:25:40] silent then the grandma moves into a
[1:25:42] certain
[1:25:44] place moves to the DU aold she begins to
[1:25:48] wipe her glasses Graham sat down ducked
[1:25:50] his head down the mother of the baby put
[1:25:52] her hand on the door began weeping but
[1:25:55] Abraham says just exactly the
[1:25:59] vision they were living the
[1:26:03] vision but yet it seems so
[1:26:06] desperate what a
[1:26:08] paradox in the most desperate of ours in
[1:26:12] the most Bleak of situations where the
[1:26:14] baby's Last Breath it could be over
[1:26:17] right there but they were actually
[1:26:19] walking in the vision that had to be
[1:26:23] fulfilled you can say why do you worry
[1:26:25] why do you fret just wait a little
[1:26:28] while why do you fret little bride why
[1:26:30] do you worry there's one here that's
[1:26:32] here to give you all the sustenance you
[1:26:34] need everything you need is right here
[1:26:36] why worry you're walking in the
[1:26:38] vision I know but in these Desperate
[1:26:41] Hours it seems like it go silent and it
[1:26:43] did for
[1:26:45] them and the old lady sat down instead
[1:26:48] of being in tears all together on the
[1:26:49] glasses it had come from the cold and
[1:26:51] foged them and brother brandom had
[1:26:53] thought a certain thing was the cause of
[1:26:55] the foggy glasses even in his he was
[1:26:57] trying to interpret what it was it says
[1:26:59] wait a second it's not the tears it's
[1:27:01] the foggy
[1:27:03] weather and he reached over a little
[1:27:05] briefcase got a little handkerchief out
[1:27:07] and little satchel and started wiping
[1:27:08] the glasses and brother Bram snaps his
[1:27:11] finger there it
[1:27:14] is it's 42
[1:27:16] inches there it
[1:27:19] is how far away are you from this moment
[1:27:26] how far away are you from God's ordained
[1:27:29] plan for your situation there might not
[1:27:31] be a prophet here that's get to detail a
[1:27:33] vision like a green checkered shirt or a
[1:27:34] baby with ponia but that doesn't mean
[1:27:36] that God can't fulfill his word he
[1:27:38] doesn't need the vision to fulfill it it
[1:27:40] happened anyhow but God gave you that so
[1:27:42] you could realize in my hour in my
[1:27:45] bleakest silent hour he's still there
[1:27:48] and you're this far from a moment where
[1:27:50] he says There It Is could you catch it
[1:27:53] tonight Lord where am I in the vision I
[1:27:55] want to walk forget the Weeping maybe my
[1:27:57] situation looks bleak but maybe there it
[1:28:00] is when your faith can lat like a little
[1:28:03] lady who grabed the Hem of a garment
[1:28:05] there it is your faith has saved you
[1:28:07] blame bmus oh son of David there it
[1:28:11] [Applause]
[1:28:12] is maybe you're just that far away from
[1:28:15] a complete transformation in your home
[1:28:18] as you walk out of here and you realize
[1:28:20] wait a second that service was my there
[1:28:22] at is moment
[1:28:25] [Applause]
[1:28:36] Hallelujah often we get our
[1:28:38] ideas so trying to figure God out don't
[1:28:42] try and figure God
[1:28:44] out don't try and figure him
[1:28:48] out Saul couldn't
[1:28:51] wait he couldn't wait the silence say
[1:28:54] Samuel was killing him where is he he
[1:28:57] said he'd be here and he couldn't just
[1:29:00] wait and so then he had to stick his own
[1:29:02] idea in do his own thing and say well
[1:29:05] forget it Samu is not here I'm just
[1:29:07] going to go ahead with how I think it
[1:29:08] should be watch it watch
[1:29:11] it things went really bad for Saul when
[1:29:14] he just couldn't wait in the silence he
[1:29:16] was killing him it's okay the silence
[1:29:19] doesn't mean God's rejected
[1:29:21] you God hasn't rejected you in your
[1:29:25] silence in the moment when it seems like
[1:29:27] he's not there it felt that way for for
[1:29:30] Martha and Mary where is
[1:29:32] he where is he he's our dearest
[1:29:36] friend one they were very close to the
[1:29:39] Lord Mary and Martha and Lazarus it
[1:29:42] wasn't some distant friendship wasn't
[1:29:45] some you know well we saw him once or
[1:29:47] twice they had a close connection and
[1:29:50] relationship with him you got to realize
[1:29:53] this situation they had communed with
[1:29:54] him they had fellowship with him Mary
[1:29:56] had sat at his feet they had such a love
[1:29:58] for each
[1:29:59] other
[1:30:01] to when they had reached out didn't even
[1:30:04] respond to them Jesus Lazarus not well
[1:30:08] please
[1:30:09] come we could apply the scripture and he
[1:30:13] answered them not a
[1:30:18] word and Jesus knew sickness was not
[1:30:21] unto death
[1:30:24] he says but for the glory of God that
[1:30:26] the Son of God might be glorified
[1:30:27] Lazarus was sick when they called in 4
[1:30:30] days now he's in the
[1:30:33] grave where were you couldn't you have
[1:30:36] come in my hour of need why now he's in
[1:30:39] the grave he's dead and gone like
[1:30:40] nothing can transpire I'm sure there's a
[1:30:42] lot of thoughts wrestling in their mind
[1:30:43] and Martha said Lord if you'd been here
[1:30:45] my brother had not have died if you
[1:30:48] hadn't been silent on
[1:30:49] me my situation would be so different
[1:30:53] now I'm in grief in sorrow I don't even
[1:30:55] know how our livelihood is going to be
[1:30:57] sustained so we we're thrown into
[1:31:00] circumstances beyond our control and
[1:31:02] Mary comes and says oh Lord if thou Hast
[1:31:04] been here my brother had not have died
[1:31:06] she repeats
[1:31:10] it Jesus said he was glad he wasn't even
[1:31:15] there so that they might
[1:31:17] believe think about that he was okay
[1:31:21] with leaving Mary and Martha to go
[1:31:24] through the grief of
[1:31:26] death and we can talk about that but
[1:31:29] those of us that have gone through that
[1:31:31] grief God said I'm just letting you go
[1:31:35] through this he didn't tell them he was
[1:31:38] silent about it Mary and Martha didn't
[1:31:40] know this they weren't told if you could
[1:31:43] I I know I'm GNA leave I'm going to not
[1:31:45] respond to you but I just need you to
[1:31:46] hold on a little bit no he didn't do
[1:31:48] that he doesn't do that to you and I
[1:31:50] either but he knew you know what he also
[1:31:54] knew he knew the seed in Mary and Martha
[1:31:58] would have the right response to the
[1:32:01] situation so he knows he can put you
[1:32:03] through a situation because he knows
[1:32:05] within you you're not going to throw in
[1:32:07] the face of God and say come on God how
[1:32:09] come you did this to me forget it I'm
[1:32:10] done believing anymore no that's that's
[1:32:12] not the response of a seed the response
[1:32:14] of a seed Lord if you'd been here my
[1:32:16] brother he wouldn't have died but still
[1:32:18] I believe that you are the resurrection
[1:32:20] and the life and on that day he'll raise
[1:32:22] up oh God you're the king of Glory
[1:32:24] you're the mighty conqueror I
[1:32:28] believe said that's the response that's
[1:32:31] the response I knew you had I knew
[1:32:33] that's all the time just come with me
[1:32:35] roll the stone
[1:32:37] away amen he was silent no longer God
[1:32:40] was ready to say all right I'm done with
[1:32:42] this I've held you in silence all so
[1:32:45] long but now I'm going to break it now
[1:32:48] I'm going to come to the tomb and I'm
[1:32:50] going to honor my voice and I'm going to
[1:32:51] say Lazarus come for for God is silent
[1:32:55] for so long and then he breaks
[1:32:59] [Applause]
[1:33:00] it he's the breaker of the silence at
[1:33:05] some point job he said it's enough job
[1:33:08] it's over I've been silent so long I'm
[1:33:11] coming down to speak to
[1:33:14] you how about tonight maybe one of you
[1:33:17] said Lord you've been silent for so long
[1:33:19] I want to tell you tonight he's a
[1:33:21] breaker of the
[1:33:22] silence at some point the silence is
[1:33:27] over he said
[1:33:30] well you know did they they didn't
[1:33:33] actually
[1:33:35] realize actually the part they were
[1:33:39] playing I'll try and go into this a
[1:33:41] little bit
[1:33:47] but they lived through a certain
[1:33:50] situation but in their in the silence
[1:33:54] the end of it was
[1:33:57] resurrection that was the end of it so
[1:33:58] God had to bring had to go through the
[1:34:00] silent hours to bring
[1:34:04] Resurrection I'm going to bridge you
[1:34:06] we're going to go a little further
[1:34:13] now
[1:34:16] Revelation
[1:34:18] 81 on you turn
[1:34:24] I need you to put your thinking cap on
[1:34:26] because now we start to
[1:34:29] drill let's
[1:34:34] drill
[1:34:36] job God seems silent Widow of zerath
[1:34:40] Silent Martha Mary silent but there
[1:34:44] comes a time I will tell you we do not
[1:34:47] serve a god of
[1:34:51] dementia we don't have a god has suffers
[1:34:54] Alzheimer's disease maybe in this world
[1:34:57] as humans we're dealing with that over
[1:34:59] and over much more but not not our God
[1:35:01] our God doesn't suffer oh sorry I
[1:35:03] totally forgot about your situation I
[1:35:05] blanked there that's not your God that's
[1:35:08] not my God everything is in order he
[1:35:10] remembers
[1:35:15] everything but says the ever remembering
[1:35:18] God remembers every promise of his word
[1:35:21] if it's in here the ever remembering God
[1:35:25] remembers every promise God don't forget
[1:35:27] nothing though it looks like it it might
[1:35:31] look like he's forgotten but he hasn't
[1:35:34] he's remembered and he's got an
[1:35:35] appointed hour when you got to D the
[1:35:38] shirt and step in the
[1:35:43] vision he said like he told Moses 400
[1:35:46] years that go through up time and
[1:35:48] Abraham his seed would sojourn in a
[1:35:49] Strange Land and I've remembered my
[1:35:52] promise and come down to make good on
[1:35:54] what I said nobody likes somebody that
[1:35:58] don't make good on what they said it's
[1:36:01] like yeah I'm there I'll be there I got
[1:36:02] your back and they don't show in your
[1:36:05] clutch moment when you really needed
[1:36:07] them like I got you you're my best all
[1:36:10] right and you're like hey where were you
[1:36:12] man oh man I had this situation that
[1:36:15] situation this came I'm so
[1:36:17] sorry that's not God that is not God the
[1:36:22] problem is sometimes we think it's our
[1:36:23] moment that we really need him he's like
[1:36:25] you actually I need to go a little
[1:36:29] more he knows the moment you need
[1:36:33] him usually in our hour of need it's
[1:36:36] usually a few steps further than what we
[1:36:38] think we need it's like it just gets a
[1:36:41] little bit worse you're like I'm at my
[1:36:43] worst moment God's like no it's actually
[1:36:45] a little bit more and then I'll come
[1:36:49] job's like I can't handle this no job
[1:36:52] it's actually all your camels and all
[1:36:53] your donkeys and all your sheep and your
[1:36:55] children and your health and it just
[1:36:58] went right to the end curse God and
[1:37:03] die God takes you all the way and Joel
[1:37:06] probably thought after the first
[1:37:07] messenger I can't even take any more
[1:37:09] than this the second messenger oh God
[1:37:13] how do I even handle this the third
[1:37:15] messenger it's the end and God's said no
[1:37:17] joob it's not quite but I will be there
[1:37:25] God don't forget he doesn't forget his
[1:37:27] curses neither does he forget his
[1:37:29] blessings God don't forget anything man
[1:37:32] he don't forget nothing if I I don't
[1:37:34] have time to go into it but Dan and
[1:37:36] Ephraim they had they were there and
[1:37:37] they Ser they served Idols there in the
[1:37:40] scripture in Deuteronomy 29 and they
[1:37:42] went and served gods of other nations
[1:37:44] and God never forgot it because in the
[1:37:47] scripture he said if you do that your
[1:37:49] name is going to be blotted from under
[1:37:51] heaven and generation went on it's like
[1:37:54] that's that's my great great great
[1:37:56] grandpappy they did that no God didn't
[1:38:00] forget because all the way then brother
[1:38:02] says and here were plumed down to the
[1:38:03] Millennium age almost and God still
[1:38:06] remembered that sin he still remembered
[1:38:09] it he remembered what he said he
[1:38:10] remembered what they did he says that's
[1:38:12] the reason friends I believe I've always
[1:38:13] tried to stay with that word no matter
[1:38:15] how strange it seems he says well he
[1:38:17] said well they thought well we got away
[1:38:19] with
[1:38:22] it thees Silence of God also doesn't
[1:38:24] mean you get away with it
[1:38:27] either you know some people go out like
[1:38:30] well whatever I'm not I'm going to leave
[1:38:31] the message and no it's maybe in the
[1:38:32] back of their mind they're like is the
[1:38:33] lightning Bol going to come no God
[1:38:36] hadn't
[1:38:38] forgotten they go and do certain
[1:38:39] transgression or they go and serve some
[1:38:41] other gods or do raise up some other
[1:38:43] Idol before God like you know well you
[1:38:45] God probably just you know nothing
[1:38:46] really happened I'm still living
[1:38:47] everything's great no everything's not
[1:38:49] great just because God hasn't said
[1:38:50] anything or done anything and you're
[1:38:52] just living as you always have doesn't
[1:38:54] mean God's forgotten come on doesn't
[1:38:57] mean he's forgotten cuz God isn't
[1:39:00] mocked he said he won't forget the curse
[1:39:03] if he won't forget the curse and he
[1:39:04] wrote it down there and but BR says all
[1:39:06] down Plumb down to here God still
[1:39:08] remembers the sin then I would have to
[1:39:10] say if you don't forget the curse what
[1:39:12] about the
[1:39:13] blessing man let's not worry about the
[1:39:15] curse side because that don't apply to
[1:39:16] you and I we're Believers but what about
[1:39:19] the blessing can a woman forget her
[1:39:21] suckling child that she should not have
[1:39:23] comp passion on the son of her womb yay
[1:39:25] they might forget a Woman Who Bore a
[1:39:28] child that has a suckling baby might
[1:39:31] forget him but God you say that's
[1:39:35] impossible for God to forget that for
[1:39:38] for my mama to forget that but God said
[1:39:40] yay they may forget yet I will not
[1:39:43] forget behold I have Graven thee upon
[1:39:45] the palm of my hands thy walls are
[1:39:47] continually before me thy children shall
[1:39:49] make haste the Destroyers and they that
[1:39:51] made thee waste shall go forth from thee
[1:39:53] God remembers His
[1:39:59] blessings maybe you just need to go
[1:40:01] through them a little
[1:40:02] bit maybe you need to remember them God
[1:40:06] hasn't forgotten them maybe you need to
[1:40:08] remember them said Lord I just need to
[1:40:10] rehearse myself with what you already
[1:40:11] know but I need to remember you are the
[1:40:14] god that Health all my
[1:40:16] disease I remember so has he not
[1:40:20] forgotten Hebrew boys they were waiting
[1:40:23] till God decided to break the silence
[1:40:27] think about that moment I I I love the
[1:40:29] story of the Hebrew boys and there they
[1:40:30] were because I love what they said there
[1:40:33] they were before the great situation
[1:40:35] they said if it be so our God whom we
[1:40:37] serve is able to Deliver Us From The
[1:40:38] Burning Fier furnace and he will deliver
[1:40:40] us out of the hand of a king but if
[1:40:44] not if God chooses to be silent in our
[1:40:49] hour of great need that's what they're
[1:40:52] saying but but if not be it known unto
[1:40:55] thee that we will not serve thy Gods nor
[1:40:59] worship the golden image if God turns
[1:41:01] his back on me and doesn't even see my
[1:41:05] situation or response still I will serve
[1:41:09] him think of that moment staring at the
[1:41:12] Flames of the fiery furnace and they
[1:41:14] said if you don't serve the gods bow
[1:41:16] down and serve the idol and if not
[1:41:18] you're going into a fiery furnace your
[1:41:20] flesh is going to burn off you alive as
[1:41:22] you stand there and you're going to melt
[1:41:24] down into Cinder and Ashes while we
[1:41:26] watch you if my God so allows that still
[1:41:31] I will serve
[1:41:33] him that's
[1:41:37] powerful you know what
[1:41:39] though it maybe seemed like God was
[1:41:43] silent but it was very loud in another
[1:41:48] place if you could just into the other
[1:41:52] dimension Gabriel just pulls the sword
[1:41:54] out Lord there's a real problem down

[1:43:36] angels to let them know I was the one

[1:44:17] your prayer and I've come to save you
[1:44:26] God cares about
[1:44:34] you the same thing happened with
[1:44:37] Elisha poor Gesa got his knickers in a
[1:44:40] knot about what was going on so
[1:44:45] Elisha we got
[1:44:48] problems Elisha had been through too
[1:44:50] much Gaya it's all right you know what
[1:44:55] was happening
[1:44:56] though fiery horses were getting hitched
[1:44:59] up the harnesses of fire were being
[1:45:02] placed on the fiery horses and chariots
[1:45:04] you what a clamor that was hey I need
[1:45:07] the I need all the the horse people up
[1:45:09] in heaven the angels that took care of
[1:45:10] them get them hitched up quick quick
[1:45:12] quick come on we got to get down there
[1:45:14] Gaz is a little worried so we need to
[1:45:16] show him that we're still here we've
[1:45:18] never left he's never left he's still
[1:45:22] here he believe then he's the same
[1:45:24] yesterday today and forever so if he
[1:45:27] came about with Gesa surely he's here
[1:45:29] tonight the horses of Heaven the legions
[1:45:32] of God are there around
[1:45:42] you it seemed like silence but a roar in
[1:45:48] [Music]
[1:45:49] heaven think about it brother Bram says
[1:45:53] about amram he says who hadn't answered
[1:45:56] a
[1:45:56] prayer God of
[1:45:59] History hadn't answered a prayer in 400
[1:46:02] years as far as we have record but he
[1:46:05] made a promise that he would bring them
[1:46:07] out and seemingly we had a silent God
[1:46:12] for a long time but the hour has come
[1:46:17] where he's going to rise on the
[1:46:20] scene the hour has come
[1:46:23] When God says I'm here I'm breaking my
[1:46:26] silence I've sat here watching long
[1:46:29] enough it's now the moment of my
[1:46:34] move and he said one night amram had
[1:46:36] prayed several years his hair was now
[1:46:38] turning gray and no deliverance and he
[1:46:40] said God you promised this we've looked
[1:46:42] forward to it and we see the signs are
[1:46:45] all here oh if I could put ourselves in
[1:46:47] this day and hour and what we're seeing
[1:46:49] around us at the day and age the signs
[1:46:50] of the times point to a certain hour
[1:46:53] Rapture season God we waited for this
[1:46:55] and we see the signs he said it's time
[1:46:58] for you to do something this was amram's
[1:47:03] prayer he says while he was in deep
[1:47:05] concentrated prayer he looked standing
[1:47:07] in the corner he rubbed his
[1:47:10] eyes he said and there straining there
[1:47:14] stood an angel can you imagine that
[1:47:17] moment when he realized God heard me
[1:47:23] after 400
[1:47:27] years is that an
[1:47:29] angel is that my answer to prayer maybe
[1:47:32] you're rubbing your eyes tonight a
[1:47:34] little
[1:47:35] bit is that the word for me
[1:47:38] tonight is that my prayer being answered
[1:47:41] is that God speaking to me telling me I
[1:47:44] heard you and I'm breaking the silence
[1:47:49] tonight I'm going to read a few quotes
[1:47:53] Revelation 81 said and when he had
[1:47:55] opened the seventh seal there was
[1:47:58] silence in heaven about the space of
[1:48:01] half an
[1:48:02] hour and many people I could say maybe
[1:48:04] get bogged down maybe they clam up or
[1:48:07] they may be spiritually shut down
[1:48:09] somewhere when these these scriptures
[1:48:11] get read like whoa I don't know where
[1:48:13] the preacher's going or that's a little
[1:48:15] deep for me or something like that when
[1:48:16] it starts to maybe go towards speaking
[1:48:19] on the seals and specifically the
[1:48:21] seventh seal but I don't believe that
[1:48:23] God who is revealed in Simplicity would
[1:48:25] to make his bride shy back from the
[1:48:28] greatest revealing of all history
[1:48:30] there's no way you should step back
[1:48:32] that's the devil that's trying to shy
[1:48:34] you away from what he's revealed in this
[1:48:38] hour people say it's closed or it hasn't
[1:48:40] been opened and Satan's trying to hinder
[1:48:43] you by telling you it's closed because
[1:48:45] he knows that it's what you need to
[1:48:48] become the bride or I should say
[1:48:50] recognize you who you are
[1:48:54] there's no Prophet other Prophet coming
[1:48:56] there's no more word to be restored
[1:48:57] there's no more other message to come
[1:48:59] it's been opened it's been shouted it's
[1:49:07] here people bring their own
[1:49:09] ideas convolute things I'm not
[1:49:13] interested in anyone else's ideas God
[1:49:15] gave one messenger there's one that
[1:49:18] fulfilled Malachi 4 there's one that
[1:49:20] fulfilled Revelation 10:7 to be that
[1:49:22] vess which a mighty Angel would use the
[1:49:25] very thought of God to be revealed to
[1:49:26] you and I we don't need to shy away from
[1:49:31] it CU it says in scripture I saw another
[1:49:34] Mighty Angel Christ come down from
[1:49:36] heaven clothed to the cloud and a
[1:49:38] rainbow was upon his head and his face
[1:49:40] was as it were the Sun and his feet as
[1:49:42] Pillar of Fire and he had in his hand a
[1:49:44] little book open and he set his right
[1:49:46] foot on the sea and his left foot on the
[1:49:48] earth and cried with a loud voice may I
[1:49:51] just say a loud voice
[1:49:54] it wasn't quiet it wasn't silent
[1:49:57] something was
[1:50:00] changing as when a lion roars and he
[1:50:03] cried seven Thunders uttered their
[1:50:07] voices seal up those
[1:50:10] things keep secret bring to silence that
[1:50:14] which the seven Thunders uttered and
[1:50:16] write them
[1:50:18] not and the angel which I saw stand upon
[1:50:20] the sea and on Earth lifted his hand to
[1:50:22] heaven SW by him that liveth forever and
[1:50:23] ever who created heaven and the things
[1:50:24] that therein are and the earth and the
[1:50:26] things that therein are and the Sea and
[1:50:28] the things which are therein and there
[1:50:30] should be time no longer but in the days
[1:50:33] of the voice of the seventh angel when
[1:50:36] he shall begin to sound if I could say
[1:50:39] silence will be
[1:50:41] broken the mystery of God should be
[1:50:44] finished silence no longer as he hath
[1:50:48] declared to his servants the prophets
[1:50:51] Hallelujah
[1:50:54] now I'll just State a few
[1:50:56] things the teaching on the Thunders must
[1:50:59] compare with the
[1:51:01] word I don't care what people say if it
[1:51:04] doesn't line up with this it's
[1:51:08] false but Brown says the way the church
[1:51:10] ages and seals and all the rest of it
[1:51:12] when anybody thinks that they have them
[1:51:14] seven Thunders if it don't compare with
[1:51:15] the rest of the word there's something
[1:51:19] wrong no one knew what the Thunders were
[1:51:21] about until a prophet revealed it the
[1:51:23] seventh Church age Prophet will be the
[1:51:25] only one that can make it
[1:51:27] known in the end time period brother BR
[1:51:30] says the seven thunders of Jesus came
[1:51:31] forth was what was in those Thunders no
[1:51:33] one knows but we need to know and it
[1:51:36] will take a prophet to get the
[1:51:37] Revelation because God has no other way
[1:51:40] of bringing out his scriptural
[1:51:41] Revelations except by a prophet the word
[1:51:44] always came by a prophet and a prophet
[1:51:48] must be Vindicated to match with the
[1:51:51] word we know that a thunder is a
[1:51:54] represents God's voice the voice of God
[1:51:56] the Thunders were revealed in the Seven
[1:51:58] Seals we're not waiting for a further
[1:52:01] Revelation brother brandham says in
[1:52:03] questions and answers he says have they
[1:52:05] asked have the seven Thunders which
[1:52:06] equal seven Mysteries already been
[1:52:07] revealed were they revealed in the Seven
[1:52:09] Seals but are yet but are yet not known
[1:52:12] to us as the Thunders yet question mark
[1:52:15] no they Thunders what he's referring to
[1:52:18] were revealed in the Seven Seals that's
[1:52:20] what the Thunders was about they was to
[1:52:23] reveal the seven Thunders uttered their
[1:52:25] voice no one could make it out John knew
[1:52:27] what it was but was to silence it and
[1:52:29] not forbid and forbid to write it but
[1:52:31] the seventh angel in the days of his
[1:52:33] sounding the seven Mysteries of the
[1:52:35] Thunders would be
[1:52:38] revealed the Seven Seals opened up what
[1:52:42] the revelation of the Thunders was now
[1:52:44] someone he says has been asking me
[1:52:46] theologians brother brandom if your
[1:52:48] experienced God gave you for his people
[1:52:50] you're eligible to write a Bible
[1:52:52] yourself your word that God your word
[1:52:54] that God has manifested look at the
[1:52:56] trickery here he says that might be true
[1:52:58] see he was trying to catch me but you
[1:53:00] see I couldn't do that he said why
[1:53:02] couldn't you you've all the
[1:53:04] qualifications I said but you look one
[1:53:06] word can't be added and he said them
[1:53:08] seven Thunders you see wouldn't them
[1:53:10] seven Thunders blasting out won't that
[1:53:12] be a revelation given to some
[1:53:15] man I said no sir it would be adding
[1:53:19] something to it or taking something from
[1:53:21] it it's the seven Thunders are all
[1:53:24] revealed in there and the Seven Seals
[1:53:26] opened up the revelation of what that
[1:53:30] was amen and another the last point the
[1:53:33] coming of the Lord the lamb taking the
[1:53:35] book and the Thunders are all
[1:53:39] connected BR says for some Reon there
[1:53:41] was some reason God let his seven voices
[1:53:43] be thundered because it must come we
[1:53:45] find that Christ the lamb that the book
[1:53:47] in his hand he opened the seventh seal
[1:53:49] it's a hidden Mystery or if I could say
[1:53:51] there's silence there
[1:53:53] there no one knows it right along with
[1:53:56] what he said no one would know his
[1:53:57] coming they also would not know about
[1:53:58] his seven Thunder mystery so you see
[1:54:01] it's connected
[1:54:03] together there's power actually in
[1:54:08] silence you know one quote said once
[1:54:10] you've matured you realize silence is
[1:54:12] more powerful than proving a
[1:54:17] point I guess you know what the
[1:54:19] demarcation of mature is now I gu yes if
[1:54:22] I have to be silenc I don't need to
[1:54:23] prove a point then I've
[1:54:25] matured Leonardo da Vinci said nothing
[1:54:28] strengthens Authority so much as
[1:54:31] silence and then another quote that many
[1:54:33] of you probably know it's better to
[1:54:34] remain silent and be thought a fool than
[1:54:36] to speak and remove all
[1:54:39] doubt so silence is a c tactic
[1:54:42] actually when you don't want no one to
[1:54:44] know anything you must maintain
[1:54:47] ultimate
[1:54:49] silence because if even one person even
[1:54:52] your bestest bestest
[1:54:58] friend even then you're at
[1:55:04] risk so God
[1:55:06] said I'm telling
[1:55:09] nobody my
[1:55:12] secret I'm sealing it
[1:55:16] up and so God the master of all strategy
[1:55:19] employed the tactic of Silence but br
[1:55:22] says if I'm planning to do something I
[1:55:23] better know bet I better know better
[1:55:25] than to tell anybody about it not that
[1:55:27] that person would tell it but Satan will
[1:55:30] hear it think about that think about
[1:55:33] that a moment he says I can I can't get
[1:55:35] it in my heart there as long as God has
[1:55:37] got it closed up with the Holy Spirit as
[1:55:39] he goes Satan can't get it in my heart
[1:55:41] as long as God has got it closed up with
[1:55:44] the holy spirit so that's between me and
[1:55:47] God there's some place there that is so
[1:55:51] protected even when the devil can't know
[1:55:53] about it but the moment you actually
[1:55:56] speak it it's now out there and he knows
[1:55:59] think about that and he says I've tried
[1:56:02] he says I tell people I'll do a certain
[1:56:03] thing and watch the devil cut off every
[1:56:05] wheel he can to get there see in beat me
[1:56:08] to it you wonder why you're like well
[1:56:11] I'm just going to go and do such and
[1:56:12] such and you're going to go bless
[1:56:13] somebody and just watch your tire fall
[1:56:14] off your engine blow out this happens
[1:56:16] your wife called you come home we got a
[1:56:17] major situation you're like we just
[1:56:19] going to bless somebody yeah well you
[1:56:21] spoke it and he's like mhm throw all
[1:56:24] hell in his way he's going to beat you
[1:56:26] to it or at least
[1:56:28] try but he said if I get the Revelation
[1:56:30] from God and just don't say nothing
[1:56:32] about it then it's different amen if I
[1:56:35] get a revelation from God I I thought
[1:56:38] Satan doesn't have unfettered access
[1:56:41] there's a top secret location that God
[1:56:44] has closed up by the holy spirit that he
[1:56:46] can send that pipeline to you and I and
[1:56:49] reveal his word to you and the devil can
[1:56:51] know nothing about
[1:56:53] it touch not the oil and the wine
[1:56:56] Revelation is between you and God and
[1:56:59] the importance of it brother Bram says
[1:57:00] as we know the importance of it cannot
[1:57:02] be underestimated he said the importance
[1:57:04] of Revelation by the spirit to a True
[1:57:06] Believer can never be overemphasized we
[1:57:08] know the quote he says no I'm talk not
[1:57:10] talking about the Book of Revelation and
[1:57:11] you but I'm talking all
[1:57:14] Revelation and to think about it to man
[1:57:18] it's silent even right here right now
[1:57:22] something's happening in another
[1:57:25] dimension and God's got a dedicated
[1:57:28] pipeline straight to your
[1:57:30] soul and the devil don't know nothing
[1:57:32] about it and he's like so what's going
[1:57:34] down there Elton Virginia and little
[1:57:37] does he know the pipeline of
[1:57:40] God God is revealing his word and the
[1:57:43] devil don't know nothing about
[1:57:48] it if Satan could have get a hold of it
[1:57:50] now
[1:57:53] speaking about God's secret there's one
[1:57:55] thing he don't know he can't interpret
[1:57:57] anything he wants to and impersonate any
[1:57:59] gift he wants again any kind of gift but
[1:58:02] he can't know this the seventh seal it's
[1:58:05] not even written in the word it's a
[1:58:08] total
[1:58:11] secret he said the Angels everything
[1:58:13] shut up if they made one move it might
[1:58:15] give away something and so they just
[1:58:17] shut up quit harping everything stopped
[1:58:20] it's butter B and I thought think of it
[1:58:23] Heaven is a loud place just for warning
[1:58:27] you when we get
[1:58:29] there it ain't
[1:58:33] silent angels that have been created
[1:58:35] just to cry out holy holy holy is the
[1:58:38] Lord God Almighty and with their wings
[1:58:40] they beat and they cover their face and
[1:58:41] their feet and they stay they fly in the
[1:58:43] throne room the pillars of Heaven are
[1:58:45] shaking at their voice it's a loud
[1:58:48] place but at this moment God says
[1:58:51] everybody
[1:58:52] don't even
[1:58:55] breathe don't move and for 30
[1:58:59] minutes
[1:59:04] nothing move can you imagine because God
[1:59:09] was so concerned he stopped
[1:59:13] heaven to ensure his secret was not
[1:59:20] revealed and now
[1:59:22] brother brandham now goes and you could
[1:59:25] listen to the seventh seal and I know
[1:59:27] who's all read the seventh seal
[1:59:29] hopefully everybody if you haven't go
[1:59:31] read it and you know you're probably
[1:59:32] going to come to the end of it and be
[1:59:35] like you're waiting for a volcano
[1:59:38] eruption and you're
[1:59:40] like and you might wonder I Wai for a
[1:59:44] big glorious boom Seven Seals been
[1:59:48] unveiled and you might might have that
[1:59:50] but it is an un
[1:59:53] folding and after the seventh seal of
[1:59:56] the seals have been opened and loosed
[1:59:59] Now message after message God starts to
[2:00:04] unveil and he starts to break
[2:00:07] [Music]
[2:00:10] silence and he comes through a message
[2:00:13] he says in the seventh seal he says and
[2:00:15] now I stand on the platform tonight I
[2:00:17] have the Revelation that revealed it's a
[2:00:20] threefold manner
[2:00:22] so he says this in the seventh seal and
[2:00:24] if you study this the word he says that
[2:00:27] I speak I will speak to you by God's
[2:00:29] help of a fold of it and then you get to
[2:00:32] the end maybe of the seventh seal and
[2:00:33] you
[2:00:34] wonder where's where is it
[2:00:37] all but you need to now start to go
[2:00:40] through what God was now revealing in a
[2:00:43] threefold manner and now where does he
[2:00:46] go there and so you start to dig a
[2:00:47] little bit and brother Brandon preaches
[2:00:49] a very significant message that if you
[2:00:51] take that little phrase three-fold
[2:00:53] manner he says it mostly in Christ The
[2:00:55] Mystery of God revealed he says God has
[2:00:57] a three-fold purpose in this great
[2:00:59] mystery secret like I said I'm drilling
[2:01:02] okay I'm going deep with an oil okay
[2:01:04] you're going to come with me because
[2:01:06] there's living water down there where
[2:01:07] we're going to tap in too so he starts
[2:01:09] to reveal the purpose of his great
[2:01:11] mystery secret the secret that only that
[2:01:13] Jesus never even spoke of God's great
[2:01:16] mystery of how he said it brother R said
[2:01:18] it's a secret he kept it a secret that's
[2:01:20] the reason under the seventh mystery
[2:01:22] when the seventh sea was open there was
[2:01:26] silence and Jesus when he was here on
[2:01:28] Earth they wanted to know he said even
[2:01:30] the son himself don't know God has all
[2:01:33] this to himself it's a secret he set
[2:01:35] heaven for he said silence in heaven for
[2:01:37] a space of half an hour seven Thunders
[2:01:38] utter the voices John was even forbidden
[2:01:40] to write see the coming of the Lord all
[2:01:44] right so now we've made a link the
[2:01:48] mystery the secret is connected with his
[2:01:52] coming okay that's the one thing he
[2:01:55] hasn't revealed yet of how he will come
[2:01:59] when he will come he said it's a good
[2:02:01] thing that he doesn't and then follows
[2:02:04] it immediately with he has showed or
[2:02:07] revealed it in every type that's in the
[2:02:09] Bible so there if you stopped there it's
[2:02:12] a good thing he hasn't but you need to
[2:02:14] keep going you need to keep digging
[2:02:16] because he showed it in every type
[2:02:19] that's in the Bible therefore the ENT
[2:02:21] enre Bible is the revelation of God's
[2:02:25] mystery in
[2:02:27] Christ it's the expression of one goal
[2:02:30] he said all the acts of the Believers
[2:02:32] have been en typ and expressing and now
[2:02:35] in this last day has revealed and he
[2:02:37] shows it you say well brother
[2:02:42] Michael help me I'm going
[2:02:47] to God goal God's goal has been
[2:02:51] Redemption all
[2:02:53] along he's had a a three-fold way so
[2:02:56] that he could come and redeem God's goal
[2:02:59] to bring back the Covenant Angel was
[2:03:01] coming down to take the other part of
[2:03:04] the Covenant which is you and I amen and
[2:03:06] so they but here the Saints of old in
[2:03:09] Scripture that brother Brenham says the
[2:03:11] entire Bible is an expression and it's
[2:03:13] revealing Christ I say well how was that
[2:03:17] well I'll tell you let's just go back to
[2:03:20] the perfect type in Scripture
[2:03:22] and we'll go back to
[2:03:24] Joseph and how many in Scripture that we
[2:03:27] could go
[2:03:28] to and we have the details of their life
[2:03:31] and we could go back here and read them
[2:03:34] and we can look back in hindsight and
[2:03:36] there was a mystery tied up in their
[2:03:39] life okay there's a mystery there there
[2:03:42] they didn't even know what they were
[2:03:43] doing and so here Joseph is now he he he
[2:03:48] starts to have dreams and he sees this
[2:03:50] dream of of she bowing down and then a
[2:03:52] sun and a moon and the stars and his
[2:03:54] brothers bowing down to him and and such
[2:03:56] and he's he's creating this incredible
[2:03:58] jealousy and
[2:04:00] hatred dreamer you little scum you're
[2:04:04] going to think that we're going to bow
[2:04:05] down to you what do you think you are
[2:04:07] you know exalt yourself above our J
[2:04:09] father our Jacob Our Father what a kind
[2:04:12] of man they mistreat him and they
[2:04:13] jealous about him and they they scorn
[2:04:15] him and they hate him so much they they
[2:04:16] send him and kick him and throw him into
[2:04:18] a
[2:04:20] pit and then they say w hey we got a
[2:04:24] slave for you we need to get rid of this
[2:04:26] guy who is he yeah just some scum we
[2:04:29] don't want around us how much take them
[2:04:31] for some silver yeah we'll buy we'll
[2:04:32] take them for some shekels of silver get
[2:04:34] them off our hands Brothers what are you
[2:04:37] doing I'm your flesh and
[2:04:41] blood oh God in the pit I'm sure he
[2:04:45] cried out hear my prayer right
[2:04:49] now silence
[2:04:52] and little did Joseph know that he was
[2:04:56] actually
[2:04:57] revealing
[2:04:59] Christ think about it if I could say
[2:05:03] this there was a mystery or I could say
[2:05:06] Christ was the mystery in Joseph being
[2:05:11] revealed because how Jesus was sold for
[2:05:13] 30 pieces of silver as Jesus was
[2:05:15] betrayed by his Brethren as Jesus was
[2:05:18] hung on a cross as Joseph went through
[2:05:20] all the different types went into prison
[2:05:22] and all these different things he was
[2:05:24] actually
[2:05:25] revealing Christ that's right that's
[2:05:27] what his life was
[2:05:30] doing said well I don't see any
[2:05:33] Scripture
[2:05:34] actually where Joseph got even a glimpse
[2:05:37] and says Joseph you're actually
[2:05:39] revealing who I am you're revealing my
[2:05:45] coming Joseph didn't get
[2:05:48] that I know you got to you got to be
[2:05:50] sold you got got to go through the
[2:05:53] ultimate
[2:05:54] betrayal Joseph because you have to
[2:05:57] reflect me you have to be a perfect
[2:06:00] reflection of me can you just do that
[2:06:03] Joseph no he didn't get that heads up
[2:06:05] that's right he had to go through it but
[2:06:08] in the mystery of his life he was
[2:06:13] revealing
[2:06:19] Christ silently
[2:06:21] in a sense God didn't tell him it was in
[2:06:24] silence that his life was being
[2:06:26] mysteriously I should say unveiled and
[2:06:29] so there in God's silence he was
[2:06:31] revealing a very type of himself you
[2:06:33] could see it through David as shimi
[2:06:35] spits on him curses
[2:06:38] him cast stones on David you bloody man
[2:06:42] he says Thou man of
[2:06:45] B this is
[2:06:48] David
[2:06:49] David the Lord has returned thee upon
[2:06:52] the all the blood of the House of Saul
[2:06:54] and deliver the kingdom into absam and
[2:06:56] thou are taken in mischief and David
[2:06:58] Rose up took his sword and said I'm
[2:07:00] gonna whack your head off you wretched
[2:07:01] evil
[2:07:02] man oh sorry that's not in
[2:07:06] scripture No it's not in scripture
[2:07:10] actually it says what have I to do with
[2:07:13] you sons of
[2:07:15] Zariah and his servant said let me take
[2:07:17] his head off if you won't no let him
[2:07:21] curse
[2:07:22] because the Lord has said unto him curse
[2:07:25] David read the scripture the Lord hath
[2:07:29] said unto him curse David who then shall
[2:07:33] say wherefore hast thou done
[2:07:36] so
[2:07:38] why because David had to portray an
[2:07:42] expression of Christ's coming that's
[2:07:44] right and had to be the rejected King
[2:07:48] and in
[2:07:49] silence you wretched
[2:07:54] and David bore that in silence as he
[2:07:58] started to reveal through his life the
[2:08:00] coming
[2:08:03] King Abraham did so joanah in the belly
[2:08:06] of the whale did
[2:08:09] so you know why Jonah is in the belly of
[2:08:12] the
[2:08:13] whale because Jesus had to come out and
[2:08:15] say for as Jonas was three days and
[2:08:18] three nights in the whale's belly oh God
[2:08:20] why am I in this the way why did he go
[2:08:22] through all this because there was one
[2:08:23] that was coming that was going to be
[2:08:25] part of his revealing that had to go
[2:08:26] into a tomb but as the scriptures say
[2:08:28] his soul would not be there and
[2:08:30] corrupted and Jesus had to pull from
[2:08:32] that life of Jonah and say as Jonah was
[2:08:34] in the
[2:08:37] whale Jonah was revealing Christ's
[2:08:39] coming it was a mystery being revealed
[2:08:42] and they had no
[2:08:44] idea no idea they just were going
[2:08:47] through life the UPS the Downs the
[2:08:49] Heavies the difficults the the the
[2:08:51] Terrible circumstances but they were
[2:08:52] revealing how about Ruth and Boaz as as
[2:08:55] Boaz is compelled to redeem Ruth why
[2:08:58] Boaz you're you're marrying a moabit a
[2:09:01] gentile I don't know what I'm compelled
[2:09:03] to Something's driving me I don't
[2:09:06] understand it myself but I must take her
[2:09:08] and Redeemer why because he's revealing
[2:09:11] a redeemer that had to come and take you
[2:09:13] and I in the mystery of boaz's life he
[2:09:16] was revealing
[2:09:18] Christ Tamar as she there went there and
[2:09:21] deceive Judah just so that the seed of
[2:09:23] Judah could Prevail and go through and
[2:09:25] say Tamar what are you
[2:09:28] doing I don't know but you can look back
[2:09:32] like of course Tamar's doing that
[2:09:33] because scripture must be fulfilled she
[2:09:36] didn't know
[2:09:38] that and she bore all that shame
[2:09:42] ridicule as she revealed the coming
[2:09:47] King okay
[2:09:52] all these Old Testament Saints and all
[2:09:55] the others that I never mentioned were
[2:09:58] participants in the
[2:10:00] revealing of
[2:10:03] Christ and they didn't know it they
[2:10:06] didn't know it why because it was a
[2:10:12] secret they had no idea the difficulty
[2:10:17] The Silence of their life that they went
[2:10:19] through where seemed God was abandoned
[2:10:21] them and they were revealing
[2:10:24] Christ unbeknownst to them that's not
[2:10:28] easy you can look back hindsight
[2:10:31] 2020 well you know way to go Abraham you
[2:10:34] went there and got locked and you P went
[2:10:36] all the way to Dan he was a warrior he
[2:10:38] was he wasn't even Warrior but he did
[2:10:40] that no that that took some
[2:10:44] guts and there even Copus and their
[2:10:47] friend as we come and Christ has stepped
[2:10:50] into flesh and he is not walking and
[2:10:51] still the disciples said well isn't a li
[2:10:54] supposed to come they're still missing
[2:10:55] the moment
[2:10:58] actually and Copus and their friend
[2:11:00] they're woefully walking down the road
[2:11:02] to me and I can tell you there probably
[2:11:04] some long moments of silence as they
[2:11:07] walked long
[2:11:10] faces clus I don't
[2:11:13] know
[2:11:15] but and they just go in
[2:11:18] silence and then one steps up beside
[2:11:20] them
[2:11:21] hey why are you so
[2:11:25] sad why are we so sad where have you
[2:11:29] been and they start to go over all the
[2:11:32] situation of their life woeful
[2:11:34] conversation and they all the situations
[2:11:36] and this Jesus has come and mighty
[2:11:39] indeed and he did this and we trusted
[2:11:41] him to redeem all Israel and they're
[2:11:42] they're just pouring out their woeful
[2:11:44] time of all the situations and then
[2:11:46] don't you certain women came and they
[2:11:48] astonished us that the seur and there
[2:11:50] certain of them went with us and found
[2:11:52] it even so that it was empty I don't
[2:11:54] know where he is now is whoa my goodness
[2:11:56] don't you know what's
[2:12:00] happened and then he said unto them oh
[2:12:03] fools slow of heart to believe all that
[2:12:07] the prophets have spoken ought not
[2:12:09] Christ to have suffered these things and
[2:12:11] beginning at Moses he expounded unto
[2:12:14] them all the scriptures concerning
[2:12:19] himself Hallelujah
[2:12:21] you know I could say it a different way
[2:12:23] and God stepped up beside them and
[2:12:26] started to break the
[2:12:28] silence and he started to point back to
[2:12:31] scripture and say see Moses there that
[2:12:34] was actually typing me see Abraham there
[2:12:37] it was typing me see David it was typing
[2:12:40] me see all through the Psalms that was
[2:12:42] me it was revealing me see Joshua see
[2:12:44] Isaiah see every single one of men
[2:12:46] through the scriptures he starts to tell
[2:12:48] them and he starts to break the seal of
[2:12:51] who he
[2:12:54] was what a walk and Copus and his friend
[2:12:58] are like
[2:13:03] wow but says it's beginning to soak into
[2:13:07] them you mean to tell me that that one
[2:13:11] Jesus of Nazareth that has walked with
[2:13:14] us is the Messiah you're telling me he's
[2:13:17] the he's the king of
[2:13:19] kings they still actually hadn't caught
[2:13:21] that it was him beside
[2:13:24] them uhhuh I think God had a little
[2:13:28] smile on his face he actually probably
[2:13:29] had to turn his head for a second like
[2:13:32] get my composure that's exactly what I'm
[2:13:35] saying
[2:13:39] Copus and he said he had done and told
[2:13:42] them that they were fools for not
[2:13:43] looking at the prophecy of the day to
[2:13:45] see the fulfilling that this had taken
[2:13:46] place in the last few days and he said
[2:13:48] and Vindicated the prophecy it was then
[2:13:50] that they knew their crucified friend
[2:13:52] Jesus had fulfilled every word of it
[2:13:55] this is him this is the Messiah we
[2:13:59] missed
[2:14:00] it where is he's gone now and I'm sure
[2:14:04] there was a flurry of of a conversation
[2:14:06] between them then The Messengers down in
[2:14:07] the Tomb this morning were right he is
[2:14:11] [Applause]
[2:14:13] alive yes he's
[2:14:16] alive God just wanted to say it's me but
[2:14:20] he couldn't he had to wait a little bit
[2:14:22] longer and he said well I think I must
[2:14:24] go no no don't you're you're opening the
[2:14:26] word to us I can't the message I need to
[2:14:29] grab a hold of it come and stay with me
[2:14:31] come and have lunch with me we need to
[2:14:33] hear more of this
[2:14:38] word they still hadn't quite caught who
[2:14:41] it was but they recognized something and
[2:14:44] so there they compel him cuz their
[2:14:47] hearts are burning he said
[2:14:49] oh comeing have
[2:14:51] dinner I tell you the silence was
[2:14:55] breaking and he comes and sits down and
[2:14:58] the son of man is now revealing
[2:15:00] himself and the scripture says he then
[2:15:03] went and broke
[2:15:07] bread he did
[2:15:09] something
[2:15:13] familiar
[2:15:15] and Jesus can you imagine Copus he's
[2:15:20] been here all this time
[2:15:22] we walked with him all this
[2:15:25] time yes but I had to do something
[2:15:28] familiar so you could recognize who I
[2:15:32] am you
[2:15:37] know isn't how
[2:15:39] beautiful that in silence actually God
[2:15:42] was allowing Copus and his friend to
[2:15:46] participate in the breaking of the
[2:15:49] silence he was a allowing them to be
[2:15:52] participants in the revealing of the
[2:15:59] secret they didn't know it but they
[2:16:04] were so then I close with
[2:16:11] this where are we
[2:16:15] today you know because even then in the
[2:16:17] in when Jesus came in flesh he told them
[2:16:20] don't it's not my time yet don't don't
[2:16:21] say anything don't say anything about
[2:16:23] that he he kind of question who are you
[2:16:25] pilate even asked him who are you who is
[2:16:27] truth what is truth and Jesus didn't say
[2:16:30] much because it it actually wasn't the
[2:16:33] full time for the full mystery of who he
[2:16:37] was of his coming this to be
[2:16:40] revealed but in this
[2:16:44] hour in this hour brother Braham says
[2:16:47] the Easter the revealed secret of God he
[2:16:51] says he broke the seal and revealed the
[2:16:52] secret who he was he said he and now God
[2:16:56] by his holy spirit broke the seal from
[2:16:58] around our lives Christ has revealed
[2:16:59] that he lives in us for now we are
[2:17:01] quickened in him it's by our natural eye
[2:17:04] or maybe our natural ear it's in silence
[2:17:06] that God has Moved Through the Ages but
[2:17:08] God by
[2:17:09] Revelation reveals to you and I his
[2:17:13] Greatest Secret of who he is amen it's a
[2:17:16] revelation that pipeline between God and
[2:17:18] you and in this hour Silence has been
[2:17:22] broken why because God sent a messenger
[2:17:25] in this day to do
[2:17:27] something
[2:17:30] familiar let me just turn my
[2:17:34] back you with a blue shirt have such and
[2:17:37] such a Nate have such and such a problem
[2:17:39] I'll turn my back as he did with Abraham
[2:17:41] what was he doing he was doing something
[2:17:43] for mear no brother Bram the son of man
[2:17:46] Christ himself was doing something
[2:17:48] familiar so you and I could be like
[2:17:50] Copus and his friended me like wait a
[2:17:52] second you mean you're he's here now yes
[2:17:56] he's here now
[2:17:58] revealing himself to you and
[2:18:06] I in this hour he says no longer no
[2:18:11] longer am I holding
[2:18:13] back Joseph didn't know what he was
[2:18:17] doing and living Moses didn't know what
[2:18:20] he was living living it was a secret I
[2:18:22] couldn't let it out I couldn't let the
[2:18:24] enemy know what was happening I had to
[2:18:26] keep it secret here I had to keep it a
[2:18:28] mystery there but in the last day in the
[2:18:31] end time I'm going to break my silence
[2:18:34] and reveal what my plan was all the
[2:18:39] time why so that you could realize that
[2:18:43] you are actually part of his mystery
[2:18:50] Christ The Mystery of God
[2:18:54] revealed in
[2:18:58] you you mean little Michael I'm going
[2:19:00] about my daily walk and I send my
[2:19:03] children to school and I come to church
[2:19:05] and I go through my trial I go through
[2:19:07] this situation and you're telling me I'm
[2:19:09] revealing Christ in this hour you're
[2:19:12] telling me I'm actually breaking the
[2:19:15] silence yes that's what I'm saying Thank
[2:19:19] You Lord and and you know
[2:19:24] it and you know
[2:19:26] [Applause]
[2:19:31] it Rahab lived Redemption story and
[2:19:36] didn't know
[2:19:38] it you are living Redemption story and
[2:19:43] know it
[2:19:45] [Applause]
[2:19:50] silent through all the
[2:19:55] ages think about it when God could say
[2:19:58] now's the hour
[2:20:00] right my
[2:20:01] delay it's
[2:20:04] over what a moment for God because he
[2:20:07] knew the devil can't do nothing anymore
[2:20:12] I've deposited my seed and it's now
[2:20:15] coming to fulfillment and all the all my
[2:20:18] plans have now moved into action and it
[2:20:20] wouldn't matter for nothing if the enemy
[2:20:22] knows because it's impossible to stop
[2:20:24] the plan of God In Action impossible so
[2:20:28] that's why now at the end time God says
[2:20:30] all right I open it up now I'm going to
[2:20:32] let you all know what I was doing all
[2:20:34] this time what Joseph was revealing what
[2:20:35] Moses was revealing what Abraham is
[2:20:37] revealing what you're revealing you're
[2:20:39] revealing me I'm my my coming in this
[2:20:41] hour and the devil can't stop it no
[2:20:45] more amen
[2:20:52] that's what the mighty Angel was coming
[2:20:53] down he's saying I'm descending the Lord
[2:20:56] himself shall descend with a shout he
[2:20:58] says I've claimed the book I've redeemed
[2:21:01] my bride and I'm going to let her know
[2:21:03] it's me all this
[2:21:05] time because if she
[2:21:07] knows who I am Christ then she'll see
[2:21:12] that she's part of me and recognize who
[2:21:15] she is which will then give her faith to
[2:21:18] come home with me
[2:21:21] it wasn't for Joseph's time it's for
[2:21:23] your
[2:21:24] time tell her as he sent a message down
[2:21:28] to a prophet tell her who she is tell
[2:21:32] her who I've been all this time he says
[2:21:35] God letting her know the secrets why
[2:21:39] because you're his
[2:21:41] bride and that's who he tells his
[2:21:43] secrets to you don't tell things to
[2:21:46] somebody else it's not your bride you
[2:21:47] have a special Secrets just for her and
[2:21:52] this hour he's saying I want to tell you
[2:21:54] a
[2:21:56] mystery because you're my briide I'm
[2:21:59] going to reveal who I am and how I'm
[2:22:04] coming to take you
[2:22:09] home he's
[2:22:12] said I want to tell
[2:22:14] her that was me and
[2:22:17] Boaz and you're my Ruth I want to tell
[2:22:20] her that I'm the word and you're my Mary

[2:22:39] Goomer I'm the king of kings and you're
[2:22:42] my
[2:22:49] bride but says and he being the groom
[2:22:52] the bride has come forth because it's
[2:22:53] part of him and it can only be the
[2:22:55] manifestation of the fulfilling of all
[2:22:57] Revelation as any others have spoke of
[2:22:59] the Bride it can only manifest if he
[2:23:01] does if it does something different from
[2:23:02] the groom it isn't the bride because
[2:23:04] she's flesh of his flesh bone of his
[2:23:06] bone life of his life power of his power
[2:23:08] that's a mouthful she is
[2:23:12] him did you catch that I'm closing
[2:23:15] musicians can
[2:23:17] come then if she is him let continue
[2:23:21] then down into the further down the
[2:23:22] message of his writing of the son he
[2:23:24] says he is the one who opened those
[2:23:26] seals he is those seals for the whole
[2:23:28] word of God is Christ and Christ is the
[2:23:30] seals that was opened what is the
[2:23:31] opening of the seals then revealing
[2:23:35] Christ so then if she is him and he is
[2:23:39] those seals then revealing Christ does
[2:23:42] what reveals
[2:23:45] you that's what this message came to do
[2:23:48] reveal you in in him so that you then
[2:23:52] can realize Lord I'm part of you and
[2:23:55] give you the faith you need to get out
[2:23:58] of
[2:24:01] [Applause]
[2:24:12] here God has broke the
[2:24:15] silence the silence is
[2:24:17] over the Secret's out
[2:24:22] the Secret's
[2:24:23] out you're going
[2:24:27] home it's home
[2:24:30] time it's been silent long
[2:24:34] enough God chose this hour he chose you
[2:24:37] to be here in this
[2:24:40] hour even in your mistakes in your
[2:24:43] difficulties and your
[2:24:45] circumstances he brought Jonah around
[2:24:48] and Jonah was used for his
[2:24:51] kingdom don't get all worried about your
[2:24:55] circumstance you're walking in the
[2:24:59] vision and nothing can stop
[2:25:04] it nothing can stop
[2:25:08] it the
[2:25:10] silence is over why don't you stand with
[2:25:13] me
[2:25:22] you
[2:25:26] know great things happen in
[2:25:30] silence we all know the sun rises in
[2:25:35] silence Tides
[2:25:37] shift in
[2:25:40] silence
[2:25:42] Revelation is
[2:25:44] deposited in
[2:25:48] silence in the silence in another
[2:25:53] dimension God is actually revealing his
[2:25:55] word to his people brother Bram says
[2:25:57] it's it's not this outside see taste
[2:25:59] feel smell and hear it's subject to
[2:26:02] death and will die but the inside part
[2:26:04] of you down there that person cannot die
[2:26:08] and that person that New Life Starts
[2:26:09] from there it's a new birth and it
[2:26:11] builds another person in the image of
[2:26:12] the person who you are then he says
[2:26:15] potentially it's here what is it the
[2:26:17] word promised before the foundation of
[2:26:19] the world and around here there this
[2:26:21] only reflects the negative that will
[2:26:24] reflect the positive the word he says or
[2:26:26] the translation of the Bride will be the
[2:26:28] same thing the word that's in you now
[2:26:30] catch this the body will
[2:26:33] materialize around that word and the
[2:26:37] same thing did by
[2:26:40] Sarah can you think about this more is
[2:26:44] happening in another dimension than you
[2:26:46] realize because the voice of this
[2:26:48] message that is piercing the Pride it's
[2:26:50] penetrating
[2:26:52] her as Abraham went down through the
[2:26:55] years we're going to have a baby we're
[2:26:57] going to have a baby and he would preach
[2:26:59] it and there was Sarah and day by day
[2:27:01] year by year she would hear him testify
[2:27:04] and something was happening by the word
[2:27:07] that he spoke he told me that we're
[2:27:10] going to have a baby he told me that
[2:27:12] Sarah you would bear a son he told me
[2:27:14] and she heard it and heard it and heard
[2:27:16] it and the word that he spoke did
[2:27:18] something and she didn't even know it
[2:27:20] maybe for a period of time her body
[2:27:22] started to
[2:27:24] materialize around that word she's like
[2:27:27] wait a second I'm
[2:27:30] changing Sarah where'd them wrinkles go
[2:27:34] you mean they're gone are you using any
[2:27:37] creams no they don't
[2:27:40] exist it was the word that Abraham was
[2:27:44] speaking of what God had said if that
[2:27:47] could change Sarah's mortal body
[2:27:50] what about the word in this hour on our
[2:27:53] lips what will it do it will
[2:27:56] materialize our body around the word for
[2:27:59] a change into another
[2:28:02] dimension you see well I don't know
[2:28:03] what's happening tonight I'll tell you
[2:28:04] what just happened tonight your body
[2:28:07] just did a little change one more step
[2:28:10] in the right direction cuz maybe it's
[2:28:13] tomorrow morning just after the service
[2:28:15] so but Tom has to preach to us that
[2:28:17] we'll leave
[2:28:18] [Music]
[2:28:23] I can't imagine what it did when it took
[2:28:25] hold of
[2:28:26] Sarah I can tell you what it was
[2:28:29] happening it was silent no
[2:28:33] longer the woe is me I haven't seen
[2:28:36] anything change yet Abraham nothing's
[2:28:39] happened to me it's been years and then
[2:28:41] suddenly he's like hey
[2:28:43] Sarah you looking younger are you
[2:28:46] kidding me you mean it's begun it surely
[2:28:49] has I can tell you Sarah when running
[2:28:52] around the camp guess what the wrinkles
[2:28:55] gone oh my goodness I can stretch my
[2:28:58] back she was silent no longer when she
[2:29:02] realized what was transpiring and I can
