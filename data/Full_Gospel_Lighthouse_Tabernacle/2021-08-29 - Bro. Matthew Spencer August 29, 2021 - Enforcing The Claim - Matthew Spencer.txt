this morning lord all the needs has been lifted up god we ask you to let us minister to them lord lord just speak to us this morning in the name of jesus we pray this thanks amen amen we believe it this morning don't we amen so good to be in the house of the lord i tell you i surely enjoyed brother william last night and i believe when he said that about that force about broke down the building i believe i asked him i said you have somebody outside planting that that lightning clap like it did i tell you what we was thankful for the rain last night on the inside of here and on the outside amen so we're just claiming more rain on the inside this morning are we amen thank you musicians this morning i'd like to start off with a a quote brother branham 1949 the deity of jesus christ and it says but that is god the creator living in you and giving you all the powers do y'all believe that this morning that you have those same powers and you're in possession of anything that he had so is it in you to abstain from evil to do good to shun the evil to flee to righteousness to turn away from temptation all malice hatred strife envy and so forth to turn away from it for that will take him from your heart if you will receive him embrace him and love him and hold him in your heart and love him i can tell you the church together and that kind of a power has the power to bind the heavens heal the sick open the eyes of the blind the dumb to speak the deaf to hear the cripples walk the blind to see why is that it's recognizing power of the almighty god in your heart there he is the deity do you claim that power this morning the same power that he has we have we're sons and daughters of god with that same power amen i'd like to go to first peter chapter 5 and verse 7 this morning and it says casting all your care upon him for he careth for you be sober be diligent because your adversary the devil is as a roaring lion walking about seeking whom he may devour he's a roaring lion roaming to and fro amen seeking whom he may devour i'd like to turn over to first john 4 and verse 4 this morning if they could put it on the board for us and let's just read this together this morning first john 4 and verse 4 ye are of god little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world let's say that again because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world amen you can have your seats this morning amen we believe that don't we we believe that that power that he has is greater than this old world this morning i'd like to speak on enforcing the claim we're going to enforce a claim this morning so y'all just bear with us we're going to have a good time i believe amen so to begin that i'd like to start over in nehemiah and nehemiah chapter 1 is where we begin at this morning and nehemiah was the one that had built the wall and i've spoke on this before but i'd like to take it in a different route this morning as what he had did to rebuild the wall to establish boundaries and i'd like to take that this morning as what he restored so nehemiah as he was in sushan the palace he had certain brothers that had come to him and had told them about how that the wall had been torn down and how that they could not rebuild it and so this made nehemiah very torn in his heart and because that was his people and they were crying out to the lord and and seeking help so they come to nehemiah and nehemiah went into prayer and i'd like to read in verse 5 of chapter 1 and nehemiah and nehemiah said i beseech thee o lord god of heaven the great and terrible god that keepeth the covenant and the mercy for them that love him and observe his commandments now he's talking to the lord and he said let thine ear now be attentive and then eyes be opened that thou mayest hear my prayer thy servant which i pray before thee now day and night for the children of israel thy servants and confess the sins of the children of israel see now they had been promised these lands but they didn't obey the commandments because of this which we have sinned against thee both i my father's house have sinned we have dealt very corruptly against thee and have not kept the commandments nor the statues nor the judgments which thou command us thy servant moses remember i beseech thee the word that thou command us thy servant moses saying now he's going to start quoting what god said unto moses he's going to quote quote god's words back to him here if you transgress i will scatter you abroad among the nations but if you turn unto me and keep my commandments and do them though there were though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of heaven yet i will gather them from thence and i will bring them into a place that i have chosen to set my name there now nehemiah started quoting that word that god had given them back unto god as brother william was saying last night god loves praises god established the angels to have praises and worship so god loves hearing his word back to him and so that's what caught the the ear of god when he started quoting the word back to him and so the lord was able to move upon the heart of the king there and give nehemiah everything that he had needed of to rebuild the wall he even sent horsemen and troops and people with him to guide the way to get to where he needed to go and i believe in in this time in this day and age that there are people that around us christians and message believers that will actually in this day and time help you out when you see that there's no other way god will set somebody there to help you out in your situations of life so nehemiah he went to to establish these boundaries now i'm not going to brother andrew he preached on breaking down barriers now i'm not trying to build them back up this morning but but we're going to to claim those boundaries back that the devil tries to take from you the devil will continue to push and push and push and tear down everything that you've tried to to establish so nehemiah was able to to help restore so he came and he restored and let's see what restore means says to give back to return to put back to bring back into existence or use it was not usable so nehemiah was able to help restore that to put back again in possession of something so as he's restoring those walls he's starting to build the confidence of the people within those walls now it took him a little bit but before long amongst themselves they were able to withstand the enemy and build that wall they started to build that barrier again now the devil will will let you start on something but he don't like it when you you get almost finished so he'll start to send an army against you and so what happened was sam balot the hornet knight and tobiath and gisham they all met together and said are we going to allow them to establish this they're going against our kingdom and that's exactly what the devil will do they'll conference amongst themselves and say we need to send somebody down here to destroy this so they continue to continue to start break down those barriers but before long nehemiah and the children there was able to establish that and now they wanted to meet again with nehemiah once the walls and everything was established they wanted to meet with him and say hey listen you know maybe this was a better idea if we helped you out on this you know maybe we can you know make an agreement and that's exactly what the devil will do he'll try to make an agreement with you he'll try to make a pact but you have to drive down the stake and say no more satan from this time on no more amen so they established their property markers so i'd like to go to that like driving down a stake and putting property markers on now my granddaddy had uh he had bought a piece of land from a neighbor one time and so he had i think it was mr shoemate come out and surveyed the land and so they put the markers there and and they're corner markers now he also had another neighbor that didn't care for the markers where they were placed at but now that surveyor knew exactly where they were and he put the post right where it was supposed to be so granddaddy comes along and finds his marker moved he said well now i don't think that that's exactly where that thing was so he had mr shoemake come out i think it was maybe two or three times to resurvey this place but on that last time grinded he said i'm gonna fix this issue he had all of us boys and thomas and us we dug a hole and we drove a stake i believe it was 10 foot long down in the ground and we poured concrete all the way around that state that steak was never moved again and that's exactly what you have to do to the devil he'll try to push that boundary marker and move it and say that ain't where it was supposed to be you're not in the place where you need to be but you drive that stake you drive it in the ground and you see minute with the word of the lord and say satan no more you're gonna be moving those boundary markers now those markers are set there for a reason now on my land i joined to the national park and on a rock attaching to my land is is a park marker now that marker is there to show exactly where that line is because they've put paint on the trees and stuff and they've tried to create little marks on the signs but now that mark in that rock won't move unless it's dug all the way up and then moved so they can come back to that rock and they can look at that rock and they can pinpoint it with latitude and longitude and say that's exactly where it's been the whole time and that's what you can do also when you drive that stake down and you can go back to that stake and you go that's exactly where it's been the whole time it's not been moved satan you've pressed it but no more i have sealed that mark there's benchmarks around the world down at the beach where we go at a house in the middle of the yard there is a marker there now that is called a bench marker a latitude and longitude bench marker to where that if the storms of life ever come natural natural storms now that barrier that concrete post is dug so deep in the ground that it won't move now there's storms of life that comes and just as i'm saying the devil comes and tries to press it no matter how how much the wind blows no matter how hard satan will blow against you and huff and puff won't be moved so speaking of property let's purchase a property this morning abraham purchased a property abraham decided excuse me he didn't decide but his wife sarah had passed away and he knew that he wanted to bury her in macpilla but he wanted to buy this property now this property was where his enemy and other people had been at so he come to him and he said i want to buy this property they said we see you're dead abraham go bury him he said no no i'm not just going to go bury them i want to buy this property i want to buy this property they said abraham you don't understand go bury your dead just just bury him he said no i don't want to just bury him out of my sight he said i want to purchase this property because he knew what laid on the inside of that property he knew the promise that was there so before long he met with efren and everyone said please just go bury your dead he said i'm going to pay you for this property what's it worth and he threw out a number 400 400 shekels so before all the children there before efren and them all for the land of macpilla he paid the price for that property all the way back he cleared it to where that property was paid now it was expensive piece of property so what abraham did was he said from the cave to the field to the trees we're gonna make sure that property because i've bought this thing now i don't know what kind of people they will be in a hundred years from now but i know what's going to happen on this property at some point he said so i'm going to make sure of the lines of this property he established and made sure and he buried sarah there because he had a promise as brother branham would say it like this said abraham said if job's going to see him i'm going to be buried right there with him so i can see him too i'll bury sarah right there and bury them all there for they knowed that the first fruits of the resurrection was coming was not coming out of egypt it was coming out of palestine so they was going to be in that resurrection that's why the price was paid for that piece of ground and the reason is today i say for all your follic and the world that have all the follicle in the world you want those that are dead in christ will god bring forth in his resurrection so bury me in jesus christ for i know where my resurrection is coming from call me what you want call me a holy roller don't make any difference to me i'm buried in christ hidden away from this whole world amen is that where you're buried at is that where you're established at bury me in christ bury me so deep in christ that the world can't even see me abraham made sure of it that's what you have to make sure of it be buried in christ amen brother tim pruitt buried sister karen pruitt just the other day now he didn't buy just a piece of property he buried her in christ he buried her where he knew she'd be resurrected again and before the time that she died she was buried in christ and he knew within his heart one of these days me and sister karen she's going to come up out of that ground that resurrection power as i'm buried in christ she's buried in christ so are you buried in christ that's where we want to be we want to claim that this morning claim that claim that piece of property claim that you're buried in christ don't just let let the world pass by and you just be going along with what the world would want you be buried in him amen it's enforcing claims that's what i'm preaching on this morning enforcing claims driving down stakes staking the claim involves first the discovery of a valuable mineral or in the qualities that a prudent man would invest the time and expense to recovery what's laying on the inside of you god seen you from the foundation of the world he was a prudent man and he said that right there he was a wise man he said that right there what's laying on the inside of there i can redeem that i'm going to drive my stake right there because i know upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell will not prevail against them amen drive down the stake but now there's also another type of claim it's called claim jumping and that's what the devil would like to do is do a little claim jumping this morning and start to claim you for his own and what is it a claim jump is a dispute of one party a jumping of a claim attempts to seize land on which another party has already laid claim and it is known as claim jumping jesus said it like this in john 10 verse 7 says verily verily i say unto you i am the door of the sheep and all that in earth came before me and all that ever came before me are thieves and robbers but the sheep did not hear them says i am the door by me if any man enter in he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture the thief cometh not but to steal to kill and destroy and i am come that might they might have life and they might have it more abundantly i am a good shepherd i am the good shepherd that giveth his life for his sheep he is the door to the sheepfold that layeth down his life now that devil might try to claim jump and jump whatever that jesus did but he said you got to come through me if you don't come through me you're a thief and a robber amen we see how that joshua and caleb as brother william was speaking last night he said that they had they had said for 40 days there couldn't claim it you know they went into the land the spies went into the land and joshua and cable went on over there and they was looking and they said it's a good land we can take this land yeah there might be giants in this land but we can claim this land joshua looked on over at caleb he said why don't we just go on down there because we know the rest of them bunch of backsliders sometimes you're going to have to walk alone sometimes you know what god has gave you in possession and you know that there's other people that's trying to steal what you've been promised and that's exactly what happened was is it was stolen from them for that 40 years but after that it was restored to joshua joshua was spoken to by the lord and the lord said unto him wherever the place of the souls of your feet shall trod i'm going to give it to you i'm going to give it to you can you claim that this morning can you claim that wherever the souls of my feet shall trod god's given me that land god has already given me that promise this morning that i'm going to take this land because i said before it was a good land it was a land flowing with milk and honey we claim that land we stake claim to it we enforce the claims now being a police officer there's certain claims that come or cases that that would come and some of the cases would be a false false case and some of them i could take before the magistrate and without a shadow of a doubt i knew that the case was justifiable and that's what the lord has done he's seen that it was a just cause a just case to be able to bring it we must press that case we must lay hold on it now many times there's there's what you call squatters on the land how many ever heard of a squatter amen squatters even have rights hard to believe but they have rights if squatters is on your land for over 30 days they have established a residence there so it's time to start seeing what you can do with a squatter now there's also a different type of thing it's called trespassing and us hunters know what trespassing is and you know that on the other side of those trespassing signs about 20 yards is the best hunting there is it's beautiful oak trees dropping acorns there's little dips and streams and it's so beautiful that's what trespassers see on the other side and that's what the devil has seen when god established a trust no trespassing here he said but it looks so good i think i can do something with that no trespassing get off the land trespassing involves in property unlawfully entering for the movement for the intention of just lingering just just for a little bit you know it won't well i won't be here long just for a little bit but just a little bit and that devil will destroy you what's the difference between trespassing and squatting the technical type of is a trespasser but squatters take it one step further and they have the intention of taking ownership and claim on the property and making their property a permanent residence brother branham said it like this it says brother we need some christians not jellyfish but with the backbone that'll stand stand for your god-given rights brother wayne lawson was preaching the other day up in canada and he said i hear a lot of people what they're standing against but i want to know what you're standing for amen i hear a lot of what you're standing against you can stand against a lot of things but tell me what you're standing for amen said stand for your god-given rights christ died for them don't be don't be pushed around we got an inheritance our inheritance belongs to us it's your privilege to have anything that you inherited through accepting jesus christ and dying to yourself satan said well i'll tell you what i'm going to do no you ain't going to tell me nothing and that's the way you got to talk to him said i know my position in christ and you just might as well get away i ain't listening to you no more i got an inheritance that's the way you got to talk to old satan said we got the title deed to it it's the abstract goes all the way back to calvary the day of pentecost when he said this promise is unto you and your children and them as many as the lord thy god shall call it's an abstract deed cleared all the way back to pentecost how far does it go back how many is it for as many as the lord thy god shall call if the lord calls you he's given you an abstract title deed all the way back and the blood of jesus christ is just as good as it had been 10 minutes ago shed every believer it's your profession profession you're just scared to use your rights don't be scared to use the rights don't be scared to use the blood of jesus christ that was shed there because you have been inherited that the abstract title deed it has been wiped all the way clean and he paid it all for you now you can go home and and he's saying here you go home and and you'll see a bunch of drunks that's coming to your house and they're having a big old party whooping and hollering and and you say no now this is my house and they'll look at you and they'll say now that was this house made for humans yes yes it was made for humans well well we're humans and and we're going to live here now see you have the right because you can show ownership of the house and you can call the law and you can say now listen these guys are trespassing and probably most of us in here if somebody's coming to your house you don't have to call the law i had a situation one time where i had a couple gentlemen i'll say gentlemen continued to park on my property so i called the law and before the law would get there they'd leave so this happened two or three times and i'd call the law and they'd leave so i called the law one night and i said now now this is about the third or fourth time that i've called y'all now either y'all can show up or you don't have to but i'm going out there to take care of it the law showed up in about 10 minutes they were still there and needless to say they never came back because the officer told them of my intentions don't come back and that's what you have to do is make the devil aware of your intentions he'll tell you how big he is but you just tell him devil my god's bigger give him your attentions tonight brother branham says it like this and says we got the title to this property it's ours that's right they all and we got an attorney sitting in glory with the blood sacrifice of his own life not only that but we got an fbi agent the holy spirit god's great detective just leave the blood there and serve warrant on him and watch the holy ghost put him out amen aren't you glad of that let's serve warren on the devil this morning because we got the right we've got the right right here and we're serving war on you today we got the just cause amen nehemiah had a just cause he had the case to be able to establish boundaries abraham said it set the cause he said for sure this property is mine now christ jesus seen us and said you're a just cause you're worth going after aren't you glad of that this morning our pastor is worth going after laying claim upon our pastor this morning we're claiming it we're believing it amen [Applause] your worship is worth a just cause to claim it your children is worth a just cause to claim it your joy is worth a just close to claim it so you claim it this morning you drive down that stake and you bury that thing and i'd say i'm going to celebrate it with concrete right here say i've laid claim on this this morning christ jesus has given me the just cause to lay claim on it this morning because what he's given me is mine it's not yours satan it's mine this morning amen the rapture is ours it's ours nobody else it it's ours you got to establish that for yourself as brother william said last night brother branham jesus christ brother branham would come just for that one you got to claim it as if you're just that one just that one in virginia i'm going the rapture is mine i'm claiming it this morning see david said he had a just cause when all of his brothers and everybody was mocking him he said no i got a cause when that uncircumcised philistines down there in that valley hollering out making fun of my god i can't just sit up here i'm going down there and god went with david and he put more spin rate on that rock better than even clinton kershaw has on a curveball hey listen he had a just calls that morning and he looked back and he said where's your brother's at i'm claiming it i'm claiming he had that just cause joshua and caleb had a just cause amen they claimed that land they said we can take that land believe it this morning like what brother branham said he said the longfellow once said the way to succeed is to find the worthy cause that's being talked about a worthy cause that's being talked about and then you hold on to it something that's being talked about turned down by science is worth to lay hold on it signs will turn down this message but we know it's got a worthy cause he said do you know in 1872 the medical association of the united states turned down bathtubs and they said they are absolutely unsanitary and they will scatter diseases well maybe that's what some people has done today is stop bathing and all these diseases is coming back amen wash your hands you filthy sinners that's scriptural amen he said in this old-fashioned gospel is what we're talking about washed in the blood of the lamb and it seemed old-fashioned but they'll you have to come to it sooner or later it's the worthy cause hold on to it with all you got it's that blood washed way that cleans a man up not going out here drinking and smoking and rallying around and calling themselves a bunch of christians because they belong to some church it's that clean unadulterated holy spirit a human life that reflects jesus christ and his son of god amen hey man let it's that blood that blood that has cleansed us amen amen it's that blood that has cleansed it was a worthy cause yes this world might say it's old-fashioned holy ghost it's just some demonized thing this ain't spiritualism we're not we're not praying to some spirit some some old grave and polishing some old school like brother william was saying last night this ain't spiritualism because we're praying to a real god amen we're not praying to some spirit somewhere as brother as brother branham told that one guy who said said now now who do you pray to well now does he have to be dead or alive because the way that they become a saint is after they're dead and then you pray to them well what happened before when they was living was it not worth praising him then amen we're praying to a living god amen let's go to mark 16. that's the church in action right there the church in action we're praying to a living god because mary magdalene and them had went to the tomb and they seen that the stoners rode away and there he came to the others and he gave them this promise and chapter 16 verse 15 it says go into all the world and to preach the gospel to every creature every single one of them and he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved amen this is the word of the lord right here this is jesus speaking to him right here claim this claim is listen to this right here he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved you can tie it down right there you can you can hold on to that tight but he that book that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out devils they shall speak in new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover that was mark 16 that was the church in action that was the word of the lord going forth to him what you're going to do with it you drive a stake right down there you you claim that right there any any claim that he's given you is yours just let go and let god have his way and it says like this says for god is the law and his word is the law and god in his word made certain claims to the church and therefore we have the right to enforce the claims upon satan and say give it back enforce those claims amen that's the church in action over in acts it's the church in power let's talk about that church in power this morning as they were all in the upper room all filled with the holy ghost there and peter among said stood up and said men and brother they are not drunk as you suppose what this world will want to do is take away that supernatural experience they don't want a bunch of hollering screaming acts 238 youngins no no they they don't need that we don't want that holy ghost no more i don't know what you're doing to these young people but you gotta quit that because they're getting too excitable well we have a right to get excited this morning we got the holy ghost laying on the inside of us amen they said they are not drunk as you suppose they want that new wine filled filled with the holy ghost amen and they said well what what are you going to do what we need to do he said repent and be baptized amen repent and be baptized acts 2 38 let's just read that this morning he said then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of the lord jesus christ for the remission of your sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost now i like this promise for this promise is unto you and your children and all that are far off in even as the lord as many of the glory of god shall call and in other words he did testify and exhort satan saying save yourself from this onward generation amen that's what you got to do you got to repent and be baptized and receive the gift of the holy ghost this morning amen now they didn't just stop there in that same hour they went and souls were saved into the kingdom amen but they didn't just say no that's good enough here as they was going on they put the church in power and used the book of acts as they went to the gate of beautiful the lame man lay in there and he was begging they said silver and gold peter and john talking to him now said silver and gold have i none but such as i have give i thee rise up and walk amen rise up and walk claim that this morning claim that power that the lord jesus has given you claim it over in 19 acts 19 goes a little further into the power as paul was passing by the other most c parts of ephesus and he asked them he said have you received the holy ghost and they said we we haven't heard there be any holy ghost we haven't heard that that's the same thing the world wants to do today we don't want to hear about this holy ghost hey but we haven't heard about this holy ghost he said well how was you baptized he said we was baptized under john's baptism a baptism of repentance he said well john said be baptized from repentance but also for the one that comes after him after me baptized in him hey what is that the name of the lord jesus christ hey and they didn't just say we receive it we believe it he said believe you don't just just don't don't believe be baptized so they were baptized in that name amen they laid hold of claim of what paul said unto them and they put that into action into power at that moment in time they were baptized but they didn't just go there they were baptized and laid hands on and filled with the holy ghost amen that's what we want this morning we want to be filled with the holy ghost so the world don't know what to do with us amen you got to claim that this morning lay claim drive that stake down for your children for your holy ghost for your joy amen you got to lay hold on it amen brother branham says it like this says the meek shall inherit the earth now this is a lengthy quote but i want you to hang with me here we're going to get through this this morning amen says the meek shall inherit the earth they're going to possess it the believer has the title the abstract title deed by jesus christ that he shall be possessor over the entire universe abraham could possess that land because of what was on it god gave it to him and lot was a part of that land too sir abraham had the right to he could call or lay hate lay hand on it and hold it now god you've made me this promise that what is in that land all that is in it is mine and you've made me that promise and i'd say to the church could say that today lord lord god here's my brother laying here stricken with cancer he's stricken with tuberculosis he's got so and so i lay hand on the promise it's my possessions you've told me to do so then you can go after that enemy you can go after that devil now and you can slaughter him just as abraham slaughtered the kings and brought back his possessions it's to the believer this morning amen yet abraham had the right to the promise and the promise was his yet he had the fight to possess it it's not just going to be given to you you're going to have to fight for it to possess it amen the believer today yet we're heir to all things and we're heir to every spiritual blessing that and every physical blessing and every blessing that the bible has promised us yet you have to fight for every inch of it amen you have to fight to possess that land you know what it is because it's your own and you say brother branham i need healing the promise is yours but if you ever get it you ain't going to get it easy well i thought becoming a christian was an easy street i thought everything was perfect are you kidding come on now every promise is yours but it's not going to come ever easy i'm going to tell you that you're going to have to take a take it away from satan satan captures your health you've got the right to go to satan say give it back hand it over i come in the name of the lord the possessor of heavens and earth and i'm an heir of his give it back you took my child you got her mixed up with some wrong boy you took my boy and got him mixed up with some wrong girl i claimed them i claim my children i claim my brother i claim my sister satan you took them from god's house you coached them out there but i'm coming after them i'm claiming on them claim them this morning there are some empty seats in this building claim that they be filled with sons and daughters of god that so want to serve god that the world don't know what to do with them this morning amen you claim that you drive that stake down right there and you claim them this morning say satan you've come too far these are my boundaries these are my borders i've staked my claim this morning hey man can you claim that amen [Applause] i want to talk to somebody that that claimed her promise and says now now you touch the border of his garment with your faith and you have made these claims if it is of god it will come to pass and if it isn't of god it won't come to pass and that's that's only what's true we're among believers now now you have to be a believer the same as a believer you have to believe this truth you have to believe it it will happen now pray each one of you and believe in your own way in matthew 9 he talks about that woman that claimed her promise matthew 9 and verse 20 and said and behold the woman that was diseased with the issue of blood for 12 years came behind him and touched the hem of his garment for she said within herself if i made but touch the his garment i shall be whole and jesus turned about and when he saw her he said daughter be of good cheer be of good comfort thy faith has me made the whole and the woman was made whole from that hour she claimed that promise she she didn't just look at the crowd she didn't look at how great the crowd was she looked at her promise she looked at her claim and said right there right there is where i can get healed right there right there at that altar is where i can claim it right there is where i can get the holy ghost right there is where i can get my healing right in your seats this morning is where you can receive it amen just claim it all she did was believe that if she just touched the helm of his just the just the little hem of his garment oh church she laid claim on that and she believed with all her heart and he said thy faith has made thee whole it's your faith that's going to claim it this morning it might not be an easy street it's going to be tough but lay claim on it christ said our lives were a worthy cause when we were drunks dope addicts thieves whoremongers out in this whole world he's seen us he's seen us in the mirror clay he said you're you're a worthy cause brother shannon you're a worthy cause brother greg you're a worthy cause brother vernon brother bill brother stephen brother christopher your worthy cause he said those are mine worthy calls now don't just push to the side this morning the price has been paid except the blood of jesus christ the debt is cleared he paid a debt i couldn't pay he paid it all this morning he cleared it all the way back that abstract title did he cleared it all the way back said my blood on calvary has paid the price this morning amen let me show you another reason why satan hates this book of revelations jesus christ the church because he knows that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen and he changes not he knows that a whole lot more than even 90 percent of these theologians and he knows that god is immutable in his nature he is immutable in all of his all his ways and thus satan knows assuredly the original church at pentecost with the power of god mark 16 in action this is the true church jesus claims as his own and all else fails it has to be now remember this christ in his true church is a continuation of the book of acts amen but the book of revelation shows how that that antichrist spirit will come into the church and defile it and make it lukewarm and formal powerless it exposes satan revealing his works attempting to destruct god's people and discredit god's word right down to the time that he has been cast into the lake of fire and he fights that he cannot stand it because he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for and what she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army you claim that this morning you claim that promise when satan is there trying to steal that away from you trying to create you a lukewarm spirit and just say well i'll just barely get by no satan i'm an invincible army i have claimed it i recognize who i am my possession is in christ jesus this world is going to pass away but my possession is in him this morning amen let's stand as musicians coming yes satan hates that revelation but we love it with that true revelation in our lives the gates of hell cannot prevail against us we'll prevail over them so you drop down your stake this morning i don't know what you have need of you haven't you know you know this morning and you drive it down right there you concrete it and you say this is mine and when the devil comes in and tries to tempt you in every way you take him back to that spot and you say right here satan's where it's at i know where my possessions at is in the blood of jesus christ let's sing a song i claim the blood have you claimed it this morning do you love him amen amen well i claim some blood in jesus chair on calvary all those precious blood stains that were shed they're just for me for all my sins oh and my [Music] i just claim those precious bloodstream loosing that to
