[56:14] mean
[56:15] how much you love us and those
[56:17] incredible kind words that you say to us
[56:19] and

[56:22] that
[56:23] and uh all the gift cards and
[56:25] and uh and some of our favorite places
[56:28] to eat
[56:29] thank you for that and we certainly do
[56:31] appreciate that
[56:33] we we love you with all of our hearts we
[56:36] miss those that are quarantined now with
[56:38] sicknesses and and we thank them for
[56:40] staying home when they were
[56:42] sick we all would say that
[56:45] and uh and so we we're we're certainly
[56:48] praying for each and every one of them
[56:50] and i know it's quite a few today
[56:52] and we want to pray for them that god
[56:54] would touch them we
[56:56] we get a touch just just in this last
[56:58] week of of how deadly this disease is a
[57:01] young man that most of this church knew
[57:04] right here
[57:05] from
[57:06] 33 years old just seems like it just
[57:09] seems like it can just reach into your
[57:11] life and just
[57:12] and just take it and just snatch your
[57:14] life out and
[57:15] and so we want to remember we want to
[57:18] remember the morris family that that
[57:20] they lost a 33 year old son and of
[57:22] course he had three children and we want
[57:24] to pray for that family that god would
[57:26] just lift them up and minister to them
[57:28] in a very special way
[57:31] amen
[57:32] next week we will have our new year's
[57:34] meeting and on saturday night brother
[57:36] matthew brother william and brother
[57:38] andrew will speak for us and then i will
[57:41] i will save my part till sunday morning
[57:43] so we're looking forward to that
[57:46] amen and william will be out of
[57:47] quarantine by then and so everything
[57:49] should be good
[57:50] amen
[57:52] he's good to a sydney
[57:54] he's certainly good to us
[57:56] brother matthew took me away this week
[57:58] and i was away for a few days and
[58:01] i'd like to thank you for your prayers
[58:02] for us and
[58:04] and uh it was there on the first uh we
[58:06] were actually hunting and uh we we were
[58:09] hunting we were not killing
[58:11] we were hunting
[58:13] and it's a it's a teaching of patience
[58:16] and so
[58:17] the lord just came and he gave us a very
[58:19] special visitation this week and a
[58:21] couple of things and uh and
[58:24] on the first day of the hunt the lord
[58:25] gave me the sermon for today
[58:28] and so i i was very pleased with that
[58:31] then he gave me a very supernatural
[58:34] vision and so
[58:35] we are we're we don't know exactly what
[58:37] all that means and don't feel quite
[58:40] ready to share those things with you but
[58:42] we're certainly thankful for that
[58:44] i would like to ask sister connie we're
[58:46] going to have a church dedication
[58:48] but sister connie wrote a post yesterday
[58:51] and i'd like for her to come and share
[58:53] that with me it's just just take about a
[58:56] minute to do that is that okay are you
[58:58] guys in a hurry or
[59:00] hey man christmas is yesterday and i
[59:02] know you're i know you're full i don't
[59:04] know if you got on the scale yesterday
[59:06] or not but
[59:07] mine said one at a time please and so
[59:13] amen so
[59:14] god bless you we love you with all of
[59:16] our hearts today is a very special day
[59:20] it's the dedication of brother justin
[59:22] and sister judy's
[59:24] twin babies
[59:25] and
[59:27] little maddox and miles is here to be
[59:29] dedicated today and we've got a big
[59:32] brother that's in the house as well and
[59:35] amen it's a it's a special day
[59:38] a few things that we can think about and
[59:41] i just wrote down just before coming to
[59:43] the service today was that
[59:45] one night during service the lord spoke
[59:47] to brother justin
[59:49] that
[59:50] god was going to bless him and his
[59:52] blessing so far was just like the tip of
[59:55] the iceberg
[59:56] and so today you're going to see some of
[59:58] these blessings that god has blessed him
[1:00:00] with he's blessed him with his
[1:00:03] with his egg business he now
[1:00:05] harvests incredible amount of eggs and
[1:00:07] too many for me to eat
[1:00:09] and so we're just so thankful for what
[1:00:11] god has blessed him doing that what was
[1:00:14] a dream and even a thought is now in
[1:00:16] fulfillment
[1:00:18] but one night brother justin was at work
[1:00:21] while we were having service here and
[1:00:23] the lord dealt with me to step out from
[1:00:25] behind the pulpit
[1:00:27] and to have the whole audience have
[1:00:29] prayer
[1:00:30] and i quoted psalms chapter 91 which is
[1:00:33] of course my favorite scripture
[1:00:36] and i asked the lord to have a special
[1:00:38] hedge about our police officers that
[1:00:41] evening and it would be that very
[1:00:43] evening within the hour that a man
[1:00:46] emptied his gun at only point-blank
[1:00:48] range just feet away
[1:00:50] and every one of those bullets was away
[1:00:53] from brother justin and god preserved
[1:00:56] his life even knocking some of the the
[1:00:59] police equipment off of the car and so
[1:01:02] god preserved him and he's watched over
[1:01:04] him and today we have two little fellas
[1:01:07] to be dedicated in the name of the lord
[1:01:09] jesus christ
[1:01:11] and sister judy was so sweet to send
[1:01:13] these things to me this morning
[1:01:15] maddox lynn
[1:01:17] the name of that is fortunate
[1:01:20] and blessed
[1:01:22] and we believe that amen
[1:01:27] miles ledger
[1:01:28] means merciful
[1:01:31] servant
[1:01:32] or a soldier
[1:01:34] a spear
[1:01:36] or a tribe may these two guys be
[1:01:39] soldiers of the lord
[1:01:41] and we know god is blessed the scripture
[1:01:44] says it like this in deuteronomy chapter
[1:01:47] 6
[1:01:48] now these are the commandments the
[1:01:50] statutes
[1:01:51] and the judgments which the lord your
[1:01:53] god commanded to teach you that you
[1:01:56] might do them and in the land whether
[1:01:59] you go to possess it
[1:02:01] that thou mightest fear the lord thy god
[1:02:04] to keep all his statutes
[1:02:06] and his commandments which i command you
[1:02:09] and
[1:02:10] thou and thy son and thy son son and all
[1:02:13] the days of thy life that thy days may
[1:02:15] be prolonged
[1:02:17] here therefore o israel observed to do
[1:02:20] do it that it may be well with thee
[1:02:23] that that ye may
[1:02:25] increase mightily as the lord
[1:02:29] of of thy fathers hath promised thee
[1:02:33] in the land that floweth with milk and
[1:02:36] honey
[1:02:37] hero israel the lord our god
[1:02:40] is one lord
[1:02:42] and thou shalt love the lord thy god
[1:02:45] with all thine heart and with all thy
[1:02:47] soul
[1:02:48] and with all thy might
[1:02:50] and these words which i command these
[1:02:53] this day shall be in thine heart and
[1:02:55] thou shalt teach them diligently unto
[1:02:58] thy children and shall talk of them when
[1:03:01] thou set us in thine house and then thy
[1:03:04] walketh by the way and when thy liest
[1:03:06] down and when thy riseth up and doubt
[1:03:09] shall bind them for a sign upon thy hand
[1:03:13] and they shall be frontlets between
[1:03:16] between thine eyes and thou shalt write
[1:03:19] them upon the post of the house and of
[1:03:21] thy gates and it shall be when the lord
[1:03:24] thy god shall have brought thee into the
[1:03:26] land which he swear unto thy fathers to
[1:03:30] abraham to isaac unto jacob to give thee
[1:03:33] great and goodly cities which thou build
[1:03:36] us not
[1:03:38] verse 12 then beware lest doubt forget
[1:03:41] the lord
[1:03:43] which brought thee forth from the land
[1:03:45] of egypt from the house of bondage
[1:03:49] that thou shalt fear thy lord thy god
[1:03:52] and shall serve him and swear by his
[1:03:55] name
[1:03:57] joshua chapter 1 and verse 9
[1:04:01] have not i commanded thee be strong
[1:04:04] and of good courage and be not afraid
[1:04:07] neither be thou dismayed for the lord
[1:04:10] thy god is with thee whether so ever

[1:08:15] all right i just wanted to give a quick
[1:08:17] testimony could y'all put up mark 11 24
[1:08:24] so anyway um
[1:08:26] we was
[1:08:28] thinking the secret to all that
[1:08:29] he liked me
[1:08:32] it was no secret that we had been
[1:08:33] desiring baby for several years
[1:08:35] anyway um
[1:08:37] i
[1:08:38] worked in ob so you know all these
[1:08:41] druggies coming in and having babies and
[1:08:42] i'm like god how can they continue like
[1:08:45] having being blessed and here i am
[1:08:47] desiring a baby
[1:08:48] and then um
[1:08:51] and then right
[1:08:52] um
[1:08:53] one day i was talking when the doctors
[1:08:54] were just so frustrated it was a girl i
[1:08:56] think was our fifth baby
[1:08:57] she'd be in jail she'd get pregnant
[1:09:00] and we'd be taking care of her because
[1:09:01] you know we could give her she'd say she
[1:09:02] was in labor and we could give her
[1:09:03] ginger ellen sandwiches when she come to
[1:09:05] us and take care of her so i would just
[1:09:07] always try to share
[1:09:08] show christ to her just through my
[1:09:10] actions but it was it was something i
[1:09:12] really had to work through anyway i
[1:09:13] walked in and
[1:09:14] i looked at one of the doctors and i was
[1:09:16] like how does this keep happening she
[1:09:17] looked at me and she said judy the most
[1:09:19] unfair world you're ever working is ob
[1:09:20] and i just was like i know anyway
[1:09:23] about a month or two later i come to
[1:09:25] find out my sister-in-law and my cousin
[1:09:27] we had all got married around the same
[1:09:28] time they had been um they had just
[1:09:30] gotten pregnant we had all you know
[1:09:32] we're all praying for babies and
[1:09:34] i just i just it was kind of the night
[1:09:36] that i really lost it and i left poor
[1:09:38] justin
[1:09:39] i left and i went down to um the park
[1:09:41] and i was just crying and anyway god
[1:09:43] gave me a scripture and it was mark 11
[1:09:45] 24.
[1:09:46] well the next saturday at church andrew
[1:09:49] opens service and that's the first
[1:09:51] scripture
[1:09:52] that he um or one of the first
[1:09:53] scriptures that he said and i just put
[1:09:55] in my heart and like okay god
[1:09:56] and a month later um it ended up being
[1:10:00] april 1st
[1:10:01] which was easter
[1:10:03] and i found out i was pregnant and
[1:10:04] justin didn't think i was telling the

[1:15:15] actually in new zealand
[1:15:16] and so
[1:15:19] i asked him i said how did you know it
[1:15:20] was cancer
[1:15:22] he said you're a preacher
[1:15:24] and he said you can pick up on things
[1:15:26] and i said that's right
[1:15:28] he said
[1:15:30] i'm a doctor
[1:15:32] and he said i can feel that cancer
[1:15:35] and
[1:15:36] he said i knew you had cancer
[1:15:38] and so we would think it would be
[1:15:40] prostate cancer at that point
[1:15:43] little did we know it was lung cancer
[1:15:45] and it would be found in the in the in
[1:15:48] the lymph nodes
[1:15:49] and then it would go to the brain just
[1:15:51] only just a few days later
[1:15:53] and
[1:15:54] for those that don't know may have had
[1:15:56] your head in the sand just a bit but
[1:15:58] they gave us four months to live
[1:16:01] and uh we are now two years
[1:16:04] and so we're very thankful
[1:16:06] we're thankful when
[1:16:08] i'm so thankful that
[1:16:10] i we kind of found it was kind of a
[1:16:12] weird thing
[1:16:14] my my dog
[1:16:16] which is which is more than just a dog
[1:16:18] it was her it was one of our family
[1:16:21] and her name was belle
[1:16:23] bell was an australian shepherd
[1:16:26] and the other day just a few weeks ago
[1:16:28] they told me that bell had cancer
[1:16:31] and
[1:16:32] i was devastated i you know it's one
[1:16:35] thing for me to have it but my dog have
[1:16:37] it and so
[1:16:39] and so i gave them a good sum of money
[1:16:41] and we
[1:16:42] we started our journey and here we are
[1:16:45] three weeks later
[1:16:46] and and she went to be with
[1:16:49] she went to be with some of my loved
[1:16:51] ones and
[1:16:53] on christmas eve and so
[1:16:55] and so you know what that means there'll
[1:16:57] be another dog somewhere in our future

[1:17:02] can't i have a dog and so

[1:20:44] i'd like to look at luke chapter 2 and
[1:20:47] verse 43. for a christmas message you
[1:20:50] might think this might be an odd spot to
[1:20:52] start
[1:21:00] i want to share with you a quotation and
[1:21:02] i believe it was andrew that actually
[1:21:04] sent me this quotation yesterday
[1:21:08] it comes from charles spurgeon
[1:21:12] those little feet in the manger
[1:21:15] shall tread upon the serpent's
[1:21:18] neck
[1:21:19] and crush
[1:21:22] his head
[1:21:24] those little feet in the manger shall
[1:21:28] tread upon the serpent's neck
[1:21:31] and crush his head
[1:21:33] if satan but only knew what was coming
[1:21:38] luke chapter 2 and verse 43.
[1:21:42] and when they had fulfilled the days
[1:21:45] as they returned the child jesus
[1:21:48] tarried behind in jerusalem
[1:21:51] and joseph and his mother knew not of it
[1:21:56] but they supposing
[1:21:58] him to have been in the company
[1:22:01] when a day's journey
[1:22:04] and they sought him among their kinfolk
[1:22:06] and acquaintance
[1:22:08] and when they found him not
[1:22:11] they turned back again to jerusalem
[1:22:14] seeking him
[1:22:16] and it came to pass that after three
[1:22:18] days they found him in the temple
[1:22:21] sitting in the midst of doctors
[1:22:23] both hearing them and answering them
[1:22:26] questions
[1:22:28] and all that heard him
[1:22:31] were astonished at his understanding
[1:22:34] and answers
[1:22:36] and when they saw him they were amazed
[1:22:39] and his mother said unto him son
[1:22:42] why hast thou
[1:22:44] thus dealt with us behold
[1:22:47] thy father and i have sought thee
[1:22:50] sorrowing.
[1:22:52] and he said unto them
[1:22:55] how is it that thou sought me
[1:22:58] wish you not
[1:23:00] that i must be about my father's
[1:23:04] business
[1:23:06] and they understood not the say in which
[1:23:08] he spake unto them
[1:23:11] and he went down with them and and came
[1:23:14] to nazareth
[1:23:15] and was subject unto them
[1:23:18] but notice these words
[1:23:20] but his mother
[1:23:22] kept all these saiyans
[1:23:25] in her heart
[1:23:27] and jesus increased in wisdom and statue
[1:23:30] and in favor with god
[1:23:34] and man
[1:23:35] you may be seated this morning
[1:23:43] brother branham would talk about this
[1:23:45] layout i see an age
[1:23:48] and he would remind them that you have
[1:23:50] went off without jesus
[1:23:54] you built your organizations
[1:23:57] and you left jesus
[1:24:00] and you come back wondering
[1:24:04] mary and joseph have
[1:24:06] have came to the ceremonies
[1:24:09] they came to the great tradition
[1:24:12] but they left jesus and now tarried they
[1:24:16] went a journey a day's journey and now
[1:24:18] they begin to seek him amongst their kin
[1:24:20] folks
[1:24:22] and they go back and they find jesus in
[1:24:25] a temple
[1:24:26] and he's at work
[1:24:28] now
[1:24:29] it's a pretty powerful thing you can go
[1:24:31] to different places to read
[1:24:33] some of the things that jesus talked
[1:24:35] about
[1:24:38] jesus confounds the doctors he confounds
[1:24:40] the astronomers
[1:24:42] he confounds those theologians of that
[1:24:45] day
[1:24:47] and literally
[1:24:49] literally in one place they wanted to
[1:24:51] worship him at that point
[1:24:55] so jesus confounds the greatest minds in
[1:24:58] the world
[1:25:00] that is sitting there also for the
[1:25:02] tradition
[1:25:04] and they have gathered there as elders
[1:25:06] these were elders of elders
[1:25:09] these were the greatest men sitting
[1:25:11] there and they did not recognize
[1:25:14] who he was
[1:25:16] they did not recognize that the author
[1:25:19] and the finisher of our faith was
[1:25:22] setting as emmanuel as a twelve-year-old
[1:25:25] boy
[1:25:28] mary and joseph shows up and and when
[1:25:31] they show up they begin to talk to him
[1:25:34] and they begin to tell him
[1:25:36] now remember
[1:25:38] they're human
[1:25:39] and they have their human emotions
[1:25:42] but she does something
[1:25:44] in these statements
[1:25:46] that denies the virgin birth
[1:25:50] and she said your father and i
[1:25:53] have been looking for you
[1:25:56] but the word always corrects the error
[1:26:00] amen
[1:26:01] and jesus reminds her
[1:26:04] that i must be about my father's
[1:26:07] business
[1:26:10] the scripture very plainly tells us that
[1:26:14] after they go back to nazareth
[1:26:17] that mary
[1:26:19] very much thought deeply
[1:26:21] on these things that
[1:26:23] jesus reminds her of
[1:26:26] because
[1:26:28] there had been rumors for 12 years
[1:26:31] where this child came from
[1:26:34] they had had to move
[1:26:37] away from bethlehem into egypt
[1:26:42] to secure the baby's safety
[1:26:45] they had rumored that this child had
[1:26:48] came from roman a roman soldier
[1:26:52] but mary had maintained the testimony
[1:26:57] that i met an angel of god
[1:27:01] gabriel came and ministered to me
[1:27:05] he called me by my name
[1:27:08] and told me the commission that god was
[1:27:11] going to come to the earth
[1:27:14] he'll be emmanuel he will fulfill the
[1:27:17] scriptures of the old testament
[1:27:20] he'll fulfill the words of isaiah behold
[1:27:24] a virgin shall conceive
[1:27:28] and in that day she would be quickened
[1:27:30] to know that i'm that girl
[1:27:34] i'm that one
[1:27:36] you're no different today god's going to
[1:27:38] have a bride that'll come out of
[1:27:40] laodicea
[1:27:41] it has been quickened to you
[1:27:46] come on church it has been quickened to
[1:27:49] you
[1:27:50] and you hold the testimony true
[1:27:55] you hold it true
[1:27:57] you met the word of the lord
[1:28:01] you met the angel of god to you
[1:28:04] you had an experience
[1:28:08] you had an experience that anchored your
[1:28:10] heart
[1:28:16] this isn't the first time that god's
[1:28:18] going to shake the world with a baby
[1:28:22] we must remind ourselves of amram and
[1:28:25] joseph
[1:28:28] behold
[1:28:29] god melchizedek had sat with abraham
[1:28:34] spoke lip to ear
[1:28:37] that he was going to give him a son
[1:28:41] but he reminded him that their children
[1:28:43] would sojourn in a land for 400 years
[1:28:46] but god would send them a deliver
[1:28:50] they they went to egypt because of
[1:28:52] circumstances drove them there
[1:28:55] and they went there and after about 400
[1:28:58] years
[1:28:59] it was the time or the season
[1:29:03] the season of fulfillment of the word of
[1:29:05] the hour
[1:29:07] amram was praying before god you can
[1:29:10] hear brother branham preaching it in the
[1:29:12] teaching on moses
[1:29:14] and he describes it that how amram would
[1:29:16] go up after a long day of work of
[1:29:19] slavery and he would go up in the attic
[1:29:22] and pray and he said an angel met him
[1:29:25] i believed that
[1:29:27] an angel met him that they were going to
[1:29:29] have a child
[1:29:31] that they would have to protect that
[1:29:33] child
[1:29:37] the baby was born
[1:29:41] and they would place that baby
[1:29:44] they would place that baby in a basket
[1:29:49] now now let me just say this to you
[1:29:52] even pharaoh knew
[1:29:55] about the prophecy
[1:29:58] about this time there's a deliverer
[1:30:00] going to come
[1:30:02] so they were very much aware to try to
[1:30:05] destroy the plan of god
[1:30:08] let me just just share this with you now
[1:30:11] there's nothing that satan can do
[1:30:14] [Music]
[1:30:16] that can destroy god's plans
[1:30:20] there will be a people that will be
[1:30:21] rapture ready
[1:30:25] there will be a bride universally around
[1:30:27] the world that will be ready for the
[1:30:30] coming of the lord there will be a
[1:30:32] resurrection
[1:30:36] there will be a rapture of the church
[1:30:39] and we will go to see our lord jesus
[1:30:43] christ in a corporal body
[1:30:46] brethren said that's what believers
[1:30:48] believe
[1:30:50] and i want to say it with all the
[1:30:51] authority in my voice
[1:30:53] listen there's nothing satan can do to
[1:30:55] stop it
[1:31:01] pharaoh was no doubt
[1:31:03] trying
[1:31:05] to do whatever he could to block
[1:31:08] this deliverer from coming
[1:31:12] now no doubt he would have been very
[1:31:13] much and raised all of his armor
[1:31:16] against a man a general
[1:31:18] a great leader coming in
[1:31:22] but god would show what i'm going to do
[1:31:24] in a couple thousand years
[1:31:27] and he sent him a deliverer
[1:31:30] as a baby
[1:31:32] and then not only a deliverer
[1:31:36] he would protect that baby
[1:31:38] brother adam would use the term he said
[1:31:41] he said when joseph placed her her babe
[1:31:43] that baby in that bull rush
[1:31:46] and sent him down that crocodile and
[1:31:48] infested the river
[1:31:50] our prophet could tell us he said god
[1:31:52] commissioned gabriel
[1:31:55] to come and stand on that ark
[1:31:57] [Music]
[1:31:59] sometimes you say well that was such a
[1:32:00] cruel that was such a cruel thing that
[1:32:03] god would ask her to go down you're only
[1:32:05] looking at one side of the story the
[1:32:06] natural side
[1:32:08] god would send that baby with the great
[1:32:11] angel gabriel standing there and he said
[1:32:14] commission ten thousand angels should
[1:32:17] stand at that that and he said make sure
[1:32:21] that if a crocodile comes near him put
[1:32:23] that foot down on him if he gets in a
[1:32:27] whirlpool see that he gets out
[1:32:29] [Applause]
[1:32:32] if he did that for baby moses how much
[1:32:35] will he do that for you as a son and
[1:32:37] daughter of god
[1:32:50] what an incredible god
[1:32:53] that would send a deliverer
[1:32:55] as a baby
[1:32:58] and the daughter of pharaoh would pick
[1:33:00] up
[1:33:01] that baby
[1:33:03] and name him
[1:33:07] god would have
[1:33:09] that mother
[1:33:11] to name the baby
[1:33:14] received him out of water
[1:33:17] and call his name moses
[1:33:24] what a god
[1:33:27] what an incredible god
[1:33:30] strongest military in the world
[1:33:33] the brightest architecture in the world
[1:33:36] the highest minds in the entire world
[1:33:40] and they're going to raise their arch
[1:33:43] enemy
[1:33:44] [Music]
[1:33:46] in their own
[1:33:48] household and god's going to allow him
[1:33:51] to raise and literally be offered the
[1:33:53] throne
[1:33:56] just like jesus himself is going to be
[1:33:59] offered
[1:34:00] everything in the world and turn it down
[1:34:03] moses is going to be offered a throne
[1:34:07] and turn it down you may be offered a
[1:34:09] lot of things in your life
[1:34:11] but the seed on the inside of you
[1:34:15] will call you to a higher realm
[1:34:18] this world is not our home
[1:34:29] every
[1:34:30] prophet
[1:34:32] would be the voice of god
[1:34:34] and they would speak of this one to come
[1:34:38] they would speak of this one that would
[1:34:40] come from bethlehem
[1:34:44] they would speak of a deliverer
[1:34:47] they would speak of a messiah
[1:34:52] every prophet
[1:34:53] would point his way
[1:34:55] he'd have a spot of god on the inside of
[1:34:58] him
[1:34:59] and you would see moses and you would
[1:35:01] see god
[1:35:04] you'd see isaac you'd see abraham and
[1:35:06] you would see god
[1:35:08] but all of them were only an attribute
[1:35:10] form
[1:35:11] of a coming one
[1:35:15] and now no doubt a lot of women on the
[1:35:18] earth thought that they might have that
[1:35:20] child
[1:35:22] and then it would come past the time of
[1:35:24] emergency and they would marry maybe
[1:35:27] even the priest
[1:35:29] many women would be held back because of
[1:35:32] this prophecy but they were not the
[1:35:34] chosen one
[1:35:36] but here's a girl that is not in the
[1:35:38] who's who
[1:35:41] here's one of the poorest girls that
[1:35:43] there is
[1:35:44] but she is the predestinated seed of god
[1:35:48] the only woman ordained to ever carry
[1:35:51] the word itself
[1:35:54] and she
[1:35:55] would be that one
[1:35:57] that the angel would speak that
[1:35:59] incredible salutation
[1:36:02] and she would say be it unto me
[1:36:11] now it's just like an experience that
[1:36:13] you have
[1:36:15] it's really hard to explain that to
[1:36:17] somebody else
[1:36:18] it really is
[1:36:21] they weren't there
[1:36:23] they believe you
[1:36:25] but they don't get the emotion of it
[1:36:32] and she goes to elizabeth
[1:36:34] and she tells elizabeth what's happened
[1:36:37] now elizabeth is
[1:36:39] is pregnant
[1:36:41] but the baby's dead
[1:36:44] but she tells her of this supernatural
[1:36:47] salutation
[1:36:49] and
[1:36:50] now when she calls his name jesus
[1:36:55] which is the most triumphant name
[1:37:02] this power that's above every power
[1:37:06] more than just the letters of j-e-s-u-s
[1:37:10] but this boy
[1:37:13] is god
[1:37:15] in a human body
[1:37:18] are you with me now
[1:37:22] and literally by the name when when his
[1:37:25] name is called across her lips for the
[1:37:27] first time
[1:37:29] it creates life
[1:37:32] in a in a woman's womb that is it's dead
[1:37:37] that baby's dead but now that forerunner
[1:37:40] has got to come to life
[1:37:46] we just celebrated christmas
[1:37:49] never let it become a tradition
[1:37:52] never let it be about santa claus and
[1:37:55] all the paganism
[1:37:57] but always keep it about the lord jesus
[1:38:00] himself
[1:38:03] if you'll remember
[1:38:05] if you remember on their way to
[1:38:06] bethlehem
[1:38:08] there were stars that were gathering
[1:38:12] brother rams said that joseph would look
[1:38:14] back and see a
[1:38:16] shine on mary's face
[1:38:19] a smile on her face like he had never
[1:38:21] seen ever before
[1:38:23] and she said what's what's making you
[1:38:25] what's making you so happy what's making
[1:38:27] you smile so greatly she said
[1:38:30] i've been watching us a star
[1:38:34] follow us
[1:38:36] now she wouldn't be the only one that's
[1:38:38] watching that
[1:38:40] there's some shepherds
[1:38:42] there's magis that are watching that
[1:38:45] star
[1:38:47] because they know that that star's
[1:38:49] telling them
[1:38:52] that there's a king whatever god's doing
[1:38:54] in the heavens he's doing it on the
[1:38:56] earth
[1:38:57] brother brown would remind us the
[1:38:59] celestial heaven is declaring to us that
[1:39:03] an infant broad is being born on the
[1:39:05] earth in 1962
[1:39:08] we're not an infant no more
[1:39:11] we stand in maturity tonight
[1:39:14] as sons and daughters of jesus christ
[1:39:18] let this world fall apart
[1:39:22] let it fall apart
[1:39:24] don't get yourself so anxious about
[1:39:26] everything that's going on on cnn or fox
[1:39:29] news
[1:39:30] it's supposed to be that way
[1:39:32] there's a bride that is built for this
[1:39:34] day
[1:39:35] she will overcome
[1:39:38] she will overcome
[1:39:41] she will live through this day
[1:39:43] [Applause]
[1:39:52] hallelujah
[1:40:04] there's nobody that's like your
[1:40:05] testimony like yours
[1:40:12] when they take the baby to the temple
[1:40:16] here comes simeon
[1:40:19] and of all of the
[1:40:20] people of the thousands of people that
[1:40:23] have come
[1:40:26] here comes a man
[1:40:29] that begins to declare i have lived all
[1:40:31] my life
[1:40:33] for this
[1:40:34] day a lot of babies are going
[1:40:38] to the temple to be
[1:40:41] for to be circumcised
[1:40:43] a lot of babies are in front of them
[1:40:47] but this man identifies this baby
[1:40:51] as the messiah
[1:40:55] and he begins to lift his voice
[1:40:57] and no doubt caused that incredible
[1:41:00] reaction in the temple
[1:41:04] a blind woman
[1:41:07] who has lived in the temple for years
[1:41:11] she's just like the furniture there
[1:41:15] but she comes as a second witness that
[1:41:18] this is the baby
[1:41:20] that they have been looking for
[1:41:24] mary begins to ponder all of these
[1:41:26] things in her heart
[1:41:28] as a human mama
[1:41:32] she's met the angel
[1:41:35] she's been there in all the events
[1:41:39] now she's watching god testify of his
[1:41:43] own gift
[1:41:44] god himself jehovah had wrapped himself
[1:41:48] as a baby in a manger
[1:41:53] listen folks this is more than just some
[1:41:55] religious story
[1:41:58] this is a story of redemption
[1:42:01] god became man
[1:42:05] that man might become god
[1:42:10] are you with me now
[1:42:13] he left the ivory palaces of heaven
[1:42:17] he came to this earth
[1:42:20] and no doubt satan had watched for him
[1:42:23] as well as kings had watched for him to
[1:42:25] come
[1:42:27] this messiah
[1:42:28] was going to pay the redemption
[1:42:31] of all since adam that had failed
[1:42:36] all the sadness in the earth all the
[1:42:39] death all the calamity that can be
[1:42:42] placed back on man's fall from the
[1:42:44] garden of eden
[1:42:46] we needed a messiah
[1:42:49] we needed a leader
[1:42:51] we needed a god that could come amongst
[1:42:54] us
[1:42:55] tell me folks you needed the same god
[1:43:00] you were dead in your sins and in
[1:43:01] trespasses
[1:43:03] you tabernacle
[1:43:05] another realm of darkness
[1:43:08] you was a servant to sin but there was
[1:43:11] something on the inside of you that was
[1:43:13] calling deeper than any deep that you
[1:43:16] could have
[1:43:17] schools didn't take care of it
[1:43:20] alcohol didn't take care of it
[1:43:23] jobs didn't take care of that hunger but
[1:43:25] this jesus
[1:43:29] if he could only be born in your life
[1:43:40] but let me just say
[1:43:42] now i come to the part of the message as
[1:43:45] i said in a tree stand
[1:43:47] and god begin to deal with my heart
[1:43:59] mary was
[1:44:00] human
[1:44:06] i don't know about you
[1:44:07] but you're human
[1:44:13] if you don't know what your wife will
[1:44:14] tell you
[1:44:20] may have survived cancer but i may not
[1:44:21] survive after today
[1:44:25] but i understand this
[1:44:28] even though jesus born inside of her
[1:44:34] and she holding him
[1:44:37] it boggles my mind
[1:44:40] as she as a woman
[1:44:42] mothered him
[1:44:44] and took care of him
[1:44:46] and his little falls and he scratches
[1:44:49] and his tears
[1:44:52] his fears
[1:44:55] as a man a boy a baby
[1:45:03] his feelings as a little child
[1:45:07] not understanding everything
[1:45:14] he grew in wisdom
[1:45:17] he grew in wisdom
[1:45:19] as a little child he didn't understand
[1:45:21] everything
[1:45:23] he was different than his siblings
[1:45:28] his atmosphere was different than theirs
[1:45:33] i don't want to get too deep in that but
[1:45:34] his atmosphere was different than theirs
[1:45:38] remember as a supreme sacrifice he could
[1:45:41] never think a wrong thought
[1:45:46] not just speak a wrong thought but never
[1:45:49] think a wrong thought because remember
[1:45:51] if he is a supreme sacrifice
[1:45:56] as a man he has an accuser
[1:45:59] and the accuser
[1:46:03] and the accuser will never be able to
[1:46:06] look at him
[1:46:08] and see error
[1:46:14] i don't know when the day was and i
[1:46:15] don't even conjecture to think that way
[1:46:19] but somewhere mary had to have a
[1:46:20] conversation with jesus
[1:46:27] now i'd like i'd like to talk to you
[1:46:30] here's what i'd like to talk to you as a
[1:46:31] body of believers
[1:46:33] somewhere
[1:46:37] she had to tell him joseph's not your
[1:46:40] father
[1:46:50] maybe it's after the 12 year old
[1:46:52] i must be about my father's business
[1:46:57] mary
[1:46:58] had to repent
[1:47:02] so it takes away from any worship of
[1:47:05] mary
[1:47:06] because mary had to repent
[1:47:11] because remember she had believed the
[1:47:12] word
[1:47:13] and the word had been formed in her
[1:47:17] and now here's 12 years later
[1:47:19] she denies the testimony of the
[1:47:22] supernatural birth
[1:47:26] and listen so many times we wonder about
[1:47:29] brother branham and some of the
[1:47:30] supernatural events that took place
[1:47:33] whether it's a bridge or whether it's
[1:47:35] sword coming in his hand or seven angels
[1:47:38] came down to visit
[1:47:40] and and we wonder well brother brown
[1:47:42] just told us those things and we just
[1:47:44] believe him
[1:47:46] now you're quiet
[1:47:49] but more than that
[1:47:51] we believe 2 000 years ago a girl
[1:47:58] all of our christianity around the world
[1:48:02] is hinged on one girl
[1:48:09] it's hinged on one girl's testimony that
[1:48:12] i met an angel of god
[1:48:15] and then she goes to joseph and tells
[1:48:18] him that testimony and joseph has to
[1:48:20] have a visitation and then elizabeth has
[1:48:23] a visitation are you with me now
[1:48:27] are you with me now i find it
[1:48:29] interesting
[1:48:30] that mary has to repent
[1:48:34] for that error
[1:48:38] so you can call to mary all you want to
[1:48:40] she's your sister
[1:48:42] she's not god
[1:48:47] and i don't know quite how that she
[1:48:49] dealt how that
[1:48:50] she dealt with him
[1:48:52] but somewhere another she had to begin
[1:48:54] to tell him testimonies one after
[1:48:57] another
[1:48:59] i met an angel
[1:49:04] i met an angel
[1:49:06] and that angel
[1:49:08] and maybe describe what he looked like
[1:49:11] and he began to tell me
[1:49:12] the salutation
[1:49:14] and that salutation lined up with the
[1:49:16] scriptures of isaiah
[1:49:20] jesus it was like this we went to church
[1:49:23] on sunday
[1:49:24] and the rabbi read the scripture and
[1:49:26] something quickened in my heart
[1:49:30] and i just couldn't get away from it
[1:49:32] and we went home and joseph and i read
[1:49:34] the scripture again and we just couldn't
[1:49:36] get away from it just something
[1:49:38] quickened in our heart made it alive
[1:49:40] like never before and it was the next
[1:49:43] day i was going to get water and i came
[1:49:46] by a narrow passageway and there stood
[1:49:49] an angel
[1:49:50] oh there was people passing me by but
[1:49:52] they never recognized the angel and the
[1:49:54] angel spoke to me
[1:49:57] i've never been with the man but the
[1:49:59] angel spoke to me and and now i i am
[1:50:03] with child and it's of the holy ghost
[1:50:10] jesus you came from god
[1:50:13] and you're going back to god
[1:50:16] i don't know how to say this to you but
[1:50:18] i can only take it at his words
[1:50:23] your god
[1:50:33] i know that's something for you to
[1:50:34] ponder
[1:50:36] i've been pondering it all week
[1:50:39] and i bring it through every message
[1:50:42] you're talking about running it through
[1:50:43] a message
[1:50:44] i ran it through every
[1:50:50] sermon this baby
[1:50:53] was destined
[1:50:55] to destroy the works of the devil
[1:51:00] [Applause]
[1:51:03] this baby
[1:51:05] how it must shake hell today ain't no
[1:51:07] wonder they want to make paganism out of
[1:51:10] it
[1:51:11] and no wonder they want to do away with
[1:51:13] the deity of who jesus christ really was
[1:51:16] because this baby that was born into the
[1:51:19] earth
[1:51:20] what's the baby that was destined
[1:51:23] to destroy satan's kingdom
[1:51:28] hallelujah
[1:51:29] [Applause]
[1:51:37] and no wonder they try to hide it
[1:51:40] ain't no wonder to try to gloss it over
[1:51:42] with some santa claus
[1:51:44] ain't no wonder they try to make a lie
[1:51:46] out of it
[1:51:48] and try to destroy children's minds
[1:51:51] because this baby born
[1:51:54] would shake heaven and hell
[1:51:57] would pay the price of redemption
[1:52:00] he would do more than turn water to wine
[1:52:03] or feed 5000 with a couple loaves of
[1:52:05] bread and a few fish
[1:52:07] do more than take a leopard by the hand
[1:52:12] he would forgive sins
[1:52:15] no other prophet ever was able to do
[1:52:36] [Music]
[1:52:39] the seed of the woman
[1:52:42] shall bruise the serpent's head
[1:52:46] it was prophecy
[1:52:52] so what does satan do try to make a god
[1:52:53] out of her
[1:52:56] tries to make a god out of her
[1:52:59] call on mary hail mary's
[1:53:04] but she had to go to the upper room just
[1:53:06] like you and i
[1:53:08] she had to receive
[1:53:09] that jesus
[1:53:11] that was once in her womb
[1:53:15] she'd be the only one to have him inside
[1:53:16] of her twice
[1:53:22] she'd be the only one to carry him the
[1:53:25] second time
[1:53:28] sure she felt the agony of carrying the
[1:53:31] child
[1:53:33] and she would watch him there's nobody
[1:53:36] at greater pain when jesus is taking
[1:53:38] those strikes
[1:53:41] there's nobody in greater pain
[1:53:43] than when they're crying for him to be
[1:53:46] crucified
[1:53:47] nobody's feeling the agony any more than
[1:53:50] she was because she was the closest
[1:53:52] connection
[1:53:54] what about our close connection tonight
[1:53:59] is it worth fighting for
[1:54:02] is it worth protecting the promise
[1:54:05] is it worth holding the testimony
[1:54:09] so sacred
[1:54:21] brother emmanuel
[1:54:24] it would be so designed
[1:54:26] he is a 17 year old boy
[1:54:29] is making a trip to jeffersonville
[1:54:34] to listen to this word
[1:54:36] in person with brother branham
[1:54:41] we went to brother john paul's
[1:54:44] and i was able to hear that again
[1:54:47] and he would share that to me
[1:54:52] what it meant to him
[1:54:55] the incredible trip that it was for a
[1:54:57] young man at that age
[1:54:59] god dropped something in his heart this
[1:55:02] is true
[1:55:03] how many thousand churches did they pass
[1:55:08] on the way to 8th and penn street
[1:55:11] but god had dropped a revelation in his
[1:55:14] heart
[1:55:16] as a young man
[1:55:18] that this is the message of the hour
[1:55:23] billy andrews when it dropped in his
[1:55:25] heart when he saw brother brandon preach
[1:55:27] his first sermon it don't take a
[1:55:30] hundred don't take a thousand sermons
[1:55:33] you don't have to be convinced by the
[1:55:35] president or any of those guys
[1:55:38] you and god have an experience
[1:55:41] like mary said be it unto me
[1:55:46] and something drops in your heart and
[1:55:48] it's anchored forever
[1:55:51] your life has changed forever once that
[1:55:55] anchors in your heart
[1:55:57] i heard you pray
[1:55:59] i heard you pray i heard you stepping
[1:56:02] another round
[1:56:04] i heard you stepping around
[1:56:06] the reason that you have that access
[1:56:09] is because you met him
[1:56:12] are you with me a preacher that is worth
[1:56:15] his goods
[1:56:16] he can only preach because he met him on
[1:56:19] the backside of a desert
[1:56:22] i'm afraid we've got too many men in
[1:56:24] pulpits that have never really truly met
[1:56:26] him and it's just a story it's just
[1:56:30] somebody historical situation
[1:56:33] but we need the holy ghost in our life
[1:56:37] like never before
[1:56:43] brother brandon said if you pray long
[1:56:44] enough you'll receive the gift of the
[1:56:47] holy ghost and you speak in tongues
[1:56:52] don't you go off the limb right there
[1:56:54] just for a moment say oh brother on you
[1:56:55] that's the only initial evidence
[1:56:57] but i believe you can step into a realm
[1:56:59] to where that you can receive the holy
[1:57:02] ghost
[1:57:03] now let me just say this to you
[1:57:06] if you can go back you ain't got it
[1:57:12] if you can turn away and go back
[1:57:15] you never had it in the first place
[1:57:19] that's the reason people can come and
[1:57:20] deny the message and walk away and say
[1:57:23] everything that they they really never
[1:57:25] had it to start off with
[1:57:29] [Applause]
[1:57:37] i don't care how you dressed
[1:57:40] i don't care what kind of ties you paid
[1:57:42] i don't care what your name was
[1:57:45] if you can walk away from this message
[1:57:58] and while there's still time
[1:58:00] you better get it
[1:58:02] don't get mad at me right there
[1:58:04] i'm just your messenger
[1:58:08] i'm kind of like the mailman i do not
[1:58:10] get mad at the mailman jason
[1:58:14] because he gives me electric bills
[1:58:20] i
[1:58:22] when eli comes and drops the mail inside
[1:58:24] of my my box i don't get mad at him
[1:58:27] because he gives me insurance bills
[1:58:30] he's only the carrier
[1:58:33] going to preach to you
[1:58:35] don't get mad at the carrier
[1:58:40] that has been anointed with the same oil
[1:58:42] that was inside of the messenger of this
[1:58:46] day
[1:58:50] are you with me
[1:59:01] people get mad at me they really don't
[1:59:02] know me
[1:59:06] they really don't know me
[1:59:14] i led a man to a lord this week
[1:59:17] he's never heard me preach once
[1:59:21] not one sermon
[1:59:26] but let him into the lord this week
[1:59:36] he was different
[1:59:38] moments after
[1:59:39] we prayed
[1:59:41] and he told me the next day i'm a
[1:59:44] different man
[1:59:46] and he was
[1:59:52] i went on a hunting trip it turned out
[1:59:54] to be a fishing trip
[2:00:02] i was looking for a trophy
[2:00:04] and i got one
[2:00:11] did you see you hear what they said
[2:00:12] about brother branham
[2:00:14] yeah
[2:00:15] did you hear what they said about jesus
[2:00:21] have you heard have you heard what they
[2:00:23] said about jesus
[2:00:24] you know the same critic that'll be to
[2:00:26] jesus that'll be to brother branham now
[2:00:28] i'm bringing it to you it's going to be
[2:00:30] your critic
[2:00:33] it's going to be your critic
[2:00:35] the same spirit that denied jesus christ
[2:00:39] deny brother branham
[2:00:41] and will deny you
[2:00:46] you can feel
[2:00:48] you can feel rejection
[2:00:50] i want to i is this okay just for a few
[2:00:52] more moments can you imagine what
[2:00:56] mary felt
[2:01:00] she was always sister carol
[2:01:04] that woman
[2:01:09] what an honor
[2:01:12] what an honor
[2:01:14] i say this what an honor
[2:01:18] to be
[2:01:19] that woman
[2:01:30] nobody worshipped her while she was on
[2:01:32] the earth
[2:01:34] it was 300 years later that they wanted
[2:01:36] to worship her
[2:01:39] given time somebody will recognize
[2:01:41] brother branham as a great man
[2:01:43] but we ain't got 300 years
[2:01:48] are you with me now
[2:01:54] so stop paying attention to your critic
[2:01:58] are you hearing me i got this in a tree
[2:02:01] stand
[2:02:05] your credit don't matter
[2:02:08] as a matter of fact i said it last week
[2:02:10] their only their testimony against you
[2:02:13] is actually saying what a masterpiece
[2:02:16] you are
[2:02:19] hallelujah
[2:02:21] [Applause]
[2:02:49] brother branham said that jesus would
[2:02:51] look at the word
[2:02:53] and believe what it said about him
[2:02:58] and he would listen to mary
[2:03:01] mary was not the word
[2:03:03] but she was transferring words from an
[2:03:05] angel
[2:03:07] and taking the words of isaiah
[2:03:10] and telling jesus
[2:03:12] i'll tell you
[2:03:17] you are the i am
[2:03:24] brother on your way out on the land
[2:03:26] i don't think so
[2:03:30] because i want to come to you
[2:03:32] i'm not mary
[2:03:35] but i was sent from god
[2:03:39] to tell you and have a conversation with
[2:03:41] you
[2:03:44] you're not of this world
[2:03:47] are you getting it
[2:03:51] and you sit there sometimes then you go
[2:03:53] really

[2:04:16] scars
[2:04:17] but you're not from here

[2:04:24] if she told this story to other people
[2:04:26] they wouldn't believe
[2:04:28] but he believed
[2:04:31] and somewhere another i may preach to
[2:04:33] thousands and thousands of people but
[2:04:35] somewhere another there's going to be
[2:04:37] some people that go

[2:05:02] certain certain character remember i
[2:05:04] ain't the one that made the rules up

[2:05:38] [Applause]
[2:05:43] this world is not my home
[2:05:46] i'm just a passing through
[2:06:00] and being found in a fashion as a man
[2:06:06] he humbled himself
[2:06:08] and became obedient unto death
[2:06:12] even
[2:06:13] the death of a cross
[2:06:19] in matthew chapter 28 the great
[2:06:21] commission
[2:06:27] i've had this in my notes for
[2:06:32] for a while
[2:06:34] let me drop this in my heart monday
[2:06:38] and this morning i got up and my
[2:06:40] devotional page started right
[2:06:42] here i said god you're right on time
[2:06:46] every time
[2:06:49] go you therefore and teach all nations
[2:06:52] baptizing them in the name of the father
[2:06:56] and of the son and a holy ghost
[2:07:02] isaiah 9 and 6 said for unto us a child
[2:07:05] is born
[2:07:06] unto us a son is given
[2:07:08] the government shall be upon his
[2:07:10] shoulder and his name shall be called
[2:07:13] wonderful
[2:07:17] counselor
[2:07:18] the mighty god
[2:07:20] the everlasting father the prince of
[2:07:22] peace
[2:07:24] all of those are titles
[2:07:28] but his name shall be called all of
[2:07:30] these
[2:07:31] encapsulated in the name of jesus is
[2:07:34] wonderful counselor mighty god the
[2:07:37] everlasting father
[2:07:39] the prince of peace every bit of that is
[2:07:41] in the name of jesus
[2:07:44] so those baby feet in that manger
[2:07:49] would tran upon the serpent's head
[2:07:52] and crush him
[2:07:55] [Music]
[2:07:56] when you say jesus he is wonderful
[2:07:59] when you say jesus he is the counselor
[2:08:02] when you say jesus he is the mighty god
[2:08:05] when you say jesus he is the everlasting
[2:08:08] father jesus is him
[2:08:12] he is the prince of peace
[2:08:15] when you say matthew 28 and 19 do you
[2:08:18] therefore and teach all nations
[2:08:20] baptizing in the name of the father
[2:08:22] father is not a name no more than
[2:08:24] wonderful counsel or prince of peace
[2:08:25] mighty god or everlasting father there's
[2:08:28] no salvation in the name father
[2:08:31] or son
[2:08:32] or holy ghost
[2:08:34] you must know who the holy ghost is
[2:08:38] you know i must know who the spirit of
[2:08:40] christ is
[2:08:43] that spirit of of
[2:08:45] jesus
[2:08:46] when these are written
[2:08:48] that you might believe
[2:08:51] that jesus is the christ
[2:08:54] the son of god
[2:08:57] and that believing
[2:09:00] you may have life
[2:09:04] through
[2:09:06] his
[2:09:07] name
[2:09:10] glory
[2:09:15] [Applause]
[2:09:25] some people get mad in this political
[2:09:26] world that you say merry christmas
[2:09:30] well that's not a new movement
[2:09:33] spurgeon actually had to deal with it
[2:09:36] because there was a movement then to
[2:09:38] make it happy holidays
[2:09:42] and he said to deny that this christmas
[2:09:45] day is to be merry
[2:09:47] is to deny the savior has come to the
[2:09:50] earth
[2:09:51] and he said our life are to be filled
[2:09:54] with joy
[2:09:56] that even the saiyan of merry christmas
[2:09:59] ought to bring to us that the savior
[2:10:02] of all humanity
[2:10:05] has been born
[2:10:08] in bethlehem
[2:10:09] this
[2:10:12] day no not december the 25th but thank
[2:10:16] god he came to earth
[2:10:19] thank god he didn't leave us lost
[2:10:23] thank god he didn't leave us without
[2:10:25] peace in our life
[2:10:30] if we were just a bunch of religious
[2:10:32] entities
[2:10:34] we'd be constantly falling back over and
[2:10:36] over and over again
[2:10:38] without jesus living on the inside of
[2:10:41] your life i'm talking about the holy
[2:10:43] ghost that seal of the holy ghost living
[2:10:47] on the inside of you
[2:10:49] god's not trusting your humanity he's
[2:10:52] trusting that seed of god that has come
[2:10:55] quick into life
[2:10:59] maybe your birth happened in 1984
[2:11:02] or 2011. it doesn't matter as long as
[2:11:06] he's born in your manger
[2:11:13] and maybe nobody will believe your story
[2:11:16] like they did
[2:11:19] hers
[2:11:23] but it's true
[2:11:28] it's true
[2:11:31] and you know what
[2:11:32] you don't even have to fight about it
[2:11:35] because you know it's true
[2:11:41] in that powerful sister connie
[2:11:44] you don't have to argue about this
[2:11:46] you don't fuss about it
[2:11:49] you met an angel
[2:11:52] and when you couldn't control yourself
[2:11:54] he came
[2:11:55] and lived on the inside of you
[2:11:58] and just one day you was one way
[2:12:01] and the next day
[2:12:03] is another way
[2:12:10] and it wasn't you
[2:12:12] what holds you here stephen
[2:12:15] you don't
[2:12:17] jesus does
[2:12:19] chris you're sitting beside him you look
[2:12:20] good too this morning
[2:12:24] what holds you here
[2:12:25] the world's calling you to be a part of
[2:12:28] every kind of scene in the world
[2:12:30] what's holding you
[2:12:36] i'll tell you what's holding you
[2:12:38] that which anchored in your heart a long
[2:12:39] time ago
[2:12:42] that nobody else understands but you
[2:12:44] on a certain day in a certain time under
[2:12:48] a certain atmosphere
[2:12:49] something came to life
[2:12:51] and it was more than your daddy's
[2:12:53] thoughts or your mother's thoughts
[2:12:55] but something anchored you that you
[2:12:56] could stand
[2:12:57] when ten thousand devils tried to turn
[2:12:59] you a different way
[2:13:01] you could stand
[2:13:05] but it's not true brother ron
