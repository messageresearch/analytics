truly just feel it seems like wave after wave just keeps coming in the in the back office and i i really couldn't wait to come out this evening and uh i believe god's i believe god's got something on our hearts to say this evening and uh but first before we go into the word we'd like to thank the uh the guys that came down this week and uh for coming and adding into the service time and and uh trying to make some things better for our worship here and adding the the overhead monitors here for your for your viewing and uh trying to make it easier for reading lyrics and scriptures and those things and and certainly appreciate brother alden for the adam brother gabriel matt and brother jeremy coming down and uh and doing those things for us and we certainly we certainly were hiding a real jewel behind a behind an overhead over a screen back here and uh it's because of that cross that we're here and uh and so we're just a thankful for the ability that we have uh to be able to open that up so that we could view that it's such a beauty and uh so thankful for the brothers putting their time in and it's not easy crawling around in a great big attic space and uh but uh i'm certainly thankful for men of god that that that enjoy doing something for the house of god amen amen maybe we just sing that song jesus there's just something about that name as we get ready to go to the word this evening oh jesus oh jesus [Music] jesus there's just something about that name [Laughter] oh master oh savior o jesus o like the fragrance [Music] it's my jesus o jesus [Music] king jesus oh let all heaven [Music] [Music] and kingdoms they will all pass away but there's something about that nay oh it's my jesus oh jesus oh jesus oh there's just something [Music] about that name oh he is master o savior oh jesus oh like the fragrance oh after the oh it's my jesus my jesus oh jesus oh let all heaven and earth proclaim oh the kings and kingdoms they will all pass away but there's something about that name amen what a wonderful name it is let's just go to him in prayer this evening heavenly father we come to you lord and we we humble by our soul ourself before your presence lord this evening lord jesus what a privilege it is to be able to speak the name of jesus lord we realize the power of your name [Music] and lord when we begin to speak that name across human lips the atmosphere begins to change situations of life begin to turn and lord we just know that that when we gather in your name or two or three are there you told us that you'd be there and lord jesus we we bind our hearts together lord asking for a sincere move of the holy spirit here tonight i pray that you would move across this congregation in a very supernatural way lord i pray that you would grant the people the things that they have need of in their life the petitions they have asked lord i pray that you'd be mindful of every person sitting under the sound of our voice tonight lord we don't we don't take these things for granted lord we just want to enter into a time of worship when the word is going forth and you can begin to bless your people now i pray that you would just move me aside just for a few moments begin to speak to your people and the lovely name of our lord jesus christ amen amen if you have your bibles this evening we'd like to look over in the book of ezekiel chapter 36 verse 22 ezekiel chapter 36 and verse 2 22 and while you're you're making uh your way over in the book of ezekiel we'd like to read a quote and i asked the brothers to put it up on the the board for you from the great the great warrior joshua here brother branham said now supernaturally now the body of the lord jesus is the shadow as it was of the natural physical body of the lord and notice if healings if powers if visions if the things that that christ had in him has gone out of his shadow then christ is paralyzed his natural body sits paralyzed because that if his physical body moves his shadow will have to move with it and if we are in christ by holy ghost baptism and the way the body of christ moves it'll move the same way on earth for this is a shadow of his body amen always been in figurative types and it is tonight the body of the lord jesus christ now now taken it out of things of the world speaking of you predestinated by god called of god elected of god chosen of god saved by god baptized in the body of christ by the holy spirit and made members of this body can you identify yourself alive ready willing my shadow will move every time anything of my body moves and the holy spirit body of christ will move just as christ moves and if christ in heaven can ever get his physical body or his spiritual body on earth moving as he wants it to move watch for things to happen if he can ever get his spiritual body on earth moving as he wants it to move watch for things to happen i'd say though that we're watching those things take place it's beginning to come to life they've paralyzed it long enough but the holy spirit is bringing life into it and it's begin to wake up and begin to move because it sees its position amen ezekiel chapter 36 and verse 22 and the bible says here therefore say unto the house of israel thus saith the lord god i do not this for your sake notice i do not this for your sake o house of israel but for my holy name's sake which you have profaned among the heathen whether you went now if you look at that word shalom in in the hebrew profane it means to bore it means by implication to wound or dis dissolve figuratively to profane a person a place or a thing it means to break one's word to begin as if by opening a wedge it means to defile which you have defiled among the heathen whether you went notice what they went there in verse 23 and i will sanctify my great name which was profaned among the heathen which ye have profaned in the midst of them and the heathen shall know that i am the lord saith the lord god when i shall be sanctified in you before their eyes for i will take you from among the heathen and gather you out of all the countries and i will bring you into your own land then will i sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your idols will i cleanse you a new heart also will i give you and a new spirit will i put within you and i will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and i will give you and heart of flesh and i will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them and you shall dwell in that in the land that i gave to your fathers and you shall be my people and i will be your god may god bless his word he may be seated in the presence of the lord now we know that that god always deals with with israel as as a church but he deals with the gentiles as in individuals and we know that the bible has said it throughout the scriptures that that we are a chosen generation and you can find that that jesus himself would even say that you have not chosen me but i have chosen you and we realize that even peter would say that we are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people that we would show forth the praise of him who hath called us out of darkness into this marvelous light and god god had foreordained a people that would be called by his namesake and god has always dealt with himself and spoke of himself as the bridegroom and his church as the bride and jehovah had a bride and you go to look throughout the scriptures and you can see how that how that israel had always had always longed after god but then after a certain season that they would they were their heart would go adrift and they would go a whoring off after after different lovers and and you can find that even solomon himself that when he began to get acquainted with other wives from different countries that his heart was turned away from god not like his father david and his heart was solely and wholly placed upon god but solomon because he invited in idolatry and invited in idolater uh wives and then incorporated their worship into his worship they begin to after after the other powers of the world and even brother branham would say that christ's bride and he referring to the church has done the same thing that they went a whoring after other powers when they he said when they they just couldn't wait he said so they had to manufacture something he said they just couldn't wait for the holy spirit to come and get into the church and then when he was referring to the pentecostal dispensation or the pentecostal church or denomination he said that if they would have remained he said they would have been a blood washed people they'd have had the power in them they would have been shaking they they'd have been the world would have been shaking under her tremendous impact of the word being flesh and being spoken word by word and we realize that that whenever you see a reforming of denomination you begin to watch as a move of a move of the spirit of god that men will men will denominate it but this message has never been denominated and it's been going on and you'll watch that that after after a revival that twins are born and you'll watch that there's a jacob and an esau in every revival and i realize who i am speaking to tonight and because because of who you are is because the message came by your way and you see you see you didn't choose yourself he chose you before the foundation of the world but you watch every time throughout a reformation down through the ages that are reforming always produces a carnal impersonation but the body of the living god cannot move by carnality it's got to move by the spirit and notice what he says over in the book of ezekiel that i will sanctify my great name no notice that god is saying that that i will vindicate my name his name was great through all of their sin his name was great he did not change he did not waver but because of his name in a land where people had forgot about him and talked and talked about him and moved past moved past the gods that brought them out of egypt and they went down and went whoring after other things notice how powerful god is that god is saying in spite of all in all of your sin in spite of all of your mistakes i'm not going to allow your mistakes to hinder my name i'm not going to allow your sin i'm not gonna do allow the things that you go whoring after to hinder my great name but i will vindicate my name i will come behind my name and i will bring about what i am through my name are you with me you see god will never allow thou men to defile his great name are you with me this evening but you see men always seem to go after carnal impersonations and especially pentecostal people when they begin to watch when the spirit of the living god goes to moving on people you watch you can watch that that pentecost always goes after gifts they're always looking after signs they're always looking after something that they've seen on a wall or looking after some sign that they seen in heaven now i believe that those things are there for the believers but it'll be a pentecostal bait when they'll jump on those sayings and they'll jump on those things and they'll miss what the word says and men will go after carnality and they'll go after something and not realize that they're worshiping a false god when they went off and left the word but notice whenever god moves god has a purpose in his move that god is always backing up a move by his word because he is the word you see god is not like you and i as mortals we have vision where we can only go as far as we can see but god goes further than what he can see because god has a long-range vision and when god moves god is after something when god moves he's after someone and maybe you don't understand why he's moving necessarily in the midst of of you right now maybe you don't understand why he's moving on a people in the sense that he's moving in maybe you don't understand why god is pouring out a spirit like he is in this hour but you realize that if god is doing something now he's got something in the future that's coming and i happen to believe that there is a young people that is birthed by the word that's setting here and maybe you don't understand the move of the holy spirit in the young people like you're seeing it but i happen to believe that they are the future of this church i happen to believe that they are not the church of tomorrow but they are the church of today and maybe you don't understand everything that's going on but you just hang on because god is already in our future hallelujah god was already in 2021 when brother homer fraser started the church in 1974 he was already here we're just catching up to his vision but the vision said that you would be here [Music] [Applause] hallelujah when it started out in a little church down in the basement then moved up to summit avenue then moved up here and you watch what god was doing he was moving a people into his vision hallelujah hallelujah see when he moves he's got a purpose in it he's looking after somebody and i happen to believe that he's got he's got men of god preaching the word of the god word of almighty god going after young people going after certain situations going after certain things because god has got long-range vision maybe you can't see your loved one sitting beside you but god's got long-range vision maybe you can't see yourself in a perfect body but god's got long-range vision maybe you can't see yourself in victory but god's got long-range vision maybe you can't see yourself in a body change but god's got long-range vision maybe you can't see yourself dancing down here but god's got long-range vision he realizes that if you're going to be dancing over there you're going to have to do a little dancing over here god's got long-range vision and he sees past what you don't see hallelujah you see notice that when god saying that i i will i will sanctify my name he is saying i'm gonna restore honor to my name but notice that when god goes to doing something he's got a twofold purpose in doing this here notice he's saying i'm gonna restore honor to my name but now i'm not gonna leave you out of the picture when i restore honor to my name i'm gonna restore you at the same time oh hallelujah i just dumped off a big old load to you this evening you see god is not just worried about what was going on and getting back his name down through the down through the dark ages all that was lost he is bringing about in a restoration in this hour that which was lost in the dark ages and all of those loose sins that hadn't been tied up and now living in an hour when the things have been restored back you see when god restores he is placing the body back in its rightful position brother random said and united under one head he said when god moves in the spirit his children move with it you see sometimes people get they get complacent or they sympathize with a message and they sit still and think well i've gone as far as i'm gonna go if you don't move with the spirit the spirit will leave you where you're sitting at some people are okay with the with the experience they had 40 years ago let me say this there are some people that would be satisfied with the experience they got on summit avenue there are people that are satisfied with the moving of the holy spirit in 1991 when they created this church and built a place but i don't happen to believe that the bride of jesus christ is happy or sympathizing or complacent in the place that she's at but she moves when the spirit moves all right he said i will restore and i will sanctify my great name and i'm going to do it in such a way that the heathen may see how holy that i am now i happen to absolutely love that that not only does god allow himself to go into a spot that his elect see how great he is but he makes his enemies see how great he is when you go to thinking about who christ is and and what christ is you can look out through the prophets and you can see what they thought christ was or what the messiah was you can see you can see what jerry has thought of him you could see what lazarus thought of him you could see what paul thought of him you could see what peter thought of him but what about when the enemy goes to testify of how great he is you know that the bible said let's just look at what the enemy said about our god that when he when he come against demons in the day of jesus when he come against him he said why those demons screamed out thou son of god why torment us thou us before our time you see they recognize who he was and they recognized that they had a future of torment so they recognized that he was the son of god when the roman centurion when he pierced when he pierced his side he truly looked on him and said truly this was the son of god judas issachara when he when he come to a spot he said i have betrayed innocent blood when you look at pilate when pilate is standing there in the judgment hall and he comes to him an inscription comes to him of his wife and she tells him don't you have nothing to do with this man named jesus i have been troubled all throughout the night time because of this man and pilate went and washed his hands in waters and said i can find no fault in this man you realize that the enemy recognized that there was no fault in jesus now some of the church world can't recognize that there's no fault in jesus but do you recognize that if you are identified in him there is no fault in a perfect bride a perfect body that is moving in operation to the holy spirit [Applause] all blessed be the name of the lord the god of abraham still lives the god of moses still lives he said i am that i am and he's still here the god of ezekiel is here the god of elijah's here [Applause] the god of william branham is right here and he's operating in a body now notice that when when god says when he begin to look over in verse 25 that you begin to watch that that that the change of god that is coming upon the people that notice that when god changes you it isn't superficial it ain't just torn a surface but it is strictly based upon the renewing of the heart god was getting ready to show the heathen that he was bigger than humanity and his plan would not be stopped by silly human mistakes by going a whoring off after a dollar tree and after false gods and when the heathens would see the time of restoration they would see how holy our god is brother brandon would take that tight and he would talk about that watch that watch getting put over in a pawn shop he said now he said now if you took a watch and you took this watch and put it down in the pawn shop and he said he said if you would take that watch and put it down that pawn shop and you tell me that you went and paid for that so that i could get it out of the pawn shop he said it would do me no good to go down there and try to pay for that watch he said because it had already been paid for you see that watch was built to be placed on a hand and it would be built to be an operation on a man's hand but something happened that caused it to go into the pawn shop and brother madam would use that as a type that you and i were put into a pawn shop and because of adam's sin and because of adam's sin we were put in the pawn shot the devil put us there but jesus came and paid and left a receipt that you don't have to pay for your sin that i have already paid for it and when you look at that you can see the receipt of the blood trail that satan has to take his hands off of god's property and you can say with the full authority i got a right to these promises i got a right to the holy ghost i got a right to a fresh revival i got a right to a move i gotta write to my young people i gotta write to my prodigals i gotta write to my family satan take your hands off i'm looking at the blood trail the blood trail tells me that he walked up calvary's hill the blood trail tells me that he went down to a belly of hell oh satan you can't cross the bloodline [Applause] satan tried to tell you you're going to have to live with that sickness all your life but you've got a right to a healing satan will try to tell you you're gonna have to deal with those symptoms but you've got a right to get over those symptoms you remember you remember what the prophet said said satan kept coming to him said you know you're sick he said that just made me testify that much more he said i'll put those symptoms on you i'll just stand you just stand around here and listen to me while i worship a little bit he said i'll make you sick and i begin to testify that much more he said if you want to hear me praise god you might as well stick around here for a little while [Applause] he said even in my sickness i kept on praising him because he had a receipt [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah i got a receipt that's a reason i can sing i got a receipt that's the reason why i believe my dad is healed of cancer i got a receipt oh hallelujah the never no lack no praising god around here i never don't like no praising around here well fglt don't care what the devil don't like we're gonna praise him with all of our might he said when i began to praise him he got on his own slew foot and went back down the street faster than he came up there what was it because he had a receipt if you could realize who you are what you got in your hand you can tell the devil get off of my property i am his body operating under this headship satan take your leave in the name of jesus christ hallelujah i got to write to it i got a right to believe that you're going to be there i got a right to believe for perfect healing i got a right for redemption i got to write for the holy ghost i got a right i got a right oh blessed be the name of the lord [Applause] but notice notice in revelation of jesus christ he said now we're saved by the blood of god the eternal god indwelted mortal be body in order to take away sin he became the lamb in order to shed his blood and enter into the veil with consider this since it is the blood of god it is the perfect blood and if the perfect blood is loosing us from the power and bondage and defilement of sin then the loosing is perfect can you say the loosing is perfect and complete and there is now therefore now no condemnation notice in romans 8 33 who shall a anything to the charge of god's elect it's god that justifies that kid that declares us righteous who is he that condemneth it is christ that die there it is his death gave us the blood the blood has loosed us there is now no condemnation how can there be [Applause] if you can get in your mind how powerful the blood is how can there be there is nothing to be condemned for because the blood has loosed us from sin we are free guiltless don't listen to man listen to the word you are loosed by the blood in another place he said he said but once you come into the kingdom of god through the blood of the lord jesus meeting upon the shed blood brought through the testimony the public testimony of the crimson blood of the lord you are in here in fellowship where god can bless you can you identify and you can shout and praise the lord and the powers of god working why it's god himself his own body the mystical body of the lord jesus christ here on earth operating the body in operation operating operating upon the basis of the shed blood brother brandon said that god hates a powerless religion and when you do not have the blood you have a powerless religion there is a blood on the mercy seat that is still interceding day and night for the believers and when satan comes against you to accuse you you can say the blood is against you [Applause] you got a right to it now notice when jude over in the book of jude that jude gives a declaration in verse 3 he said and i exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered unto the saints but some people want to limit that faith to a creed someone limited to a denomination but i say upon the authority of god's word there is no limit to the faith of god that he left for his church because he said all things are possible to them that believe now say this it's not limited it's not limited why because you have a receipt it's a privilege of an heir of christ to en to have anything that is rightfully yours you inherited it and when satan comes and tells you that i'm going to do this you say no you're not it's not limited and satan has no power over a believer hallelujah hallelujah you remember you you remember yo as soon as i began to tell tell this little testimony you you'll catch it in the message and brother burnham said there was a man that had sponsored his meeting one time that had got out under some construction under a roofer or a sidewall there and that and it had crushed him and it was tons that it fell upon this man and he said he said it was just a trick of the devil that fell upon that that had that had crushed this man and he bursted his liver and his spleen was put out of place and he began brother random began to tell his wife he said you know he said you know he said that was a trick of the devil he said here he was sponsoring me in my ministry he said but he said i believe that when he would sponsor me he was sponsoring christ and he said that was a trick of the devil that that did that he said now honey he said he said if jesus was here he said jesus wasn't like myself he said i'm a sinner he said i was born a sinner my mama's a sinner my daddy's a sinner but jesus's hands were holy hands he said he said now jesus had holy hands and he said if he was here he would come and lay his hands upon that boy no matter what the conditions were his liver bursted his spleen out of place he would lay his holy hands upon him and and everything would come back in the order because jesus was who he was he said but you see he said the difference is he said my hands are dirty hands he said but he said if the lord would give me a vision he said i could go down there in the authority of that vision and i could lay my hands upon him and he'd get well he said but i begin to think about something he said i began to think about something he said he said now whether whether i got the vision or whether i didn't get the vision it was my same hands that was being laid on that man with the same faith whether i got a vision or whether i don't got a vision god was using my same hands so do you realize tonight that god is looking for your hands he said and they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover you ain't got to have a vision because there's a blood that is representing the god of heaven and when you go in his name you are going in the authority of the name of jesus christ whether it's your dirty hands whether it's your life or not you're representing the almighty god hallelujah that watch was built to be on your hand but if ain't operating right you need to take it to a technician that can put it back in his rightful operation brother branham would type the new birth to that watch and the mainspring of that watch he said now he said he said when you go to look over in ezekiel chapter 36 and 25 he said you go in there and you watch he said he said now he said i will give you a new heart and a new spirit and then i will put my spirit upon you notice there's a lot of people that stop when they get that new spirit and they say well i stopped drinking i i stopped cussing i stopped doing this but they never went on far enough you see because if you don't go no further than that you'll find yourself back out on the street again you because you can't control your emotions you can't control your faith you can't control your senses with a new spirit are you with me you can't control yourself you see if you only got a new spirit if you've only went through justification and sanctification you will walk back out go out and fall into the same sin that you just came out of because you didn't go far enough billy just get in far enough and you won't fall out so you realize that if you can go far enough everything will go to work and exactly he said the holy spirit's like the mainspring of that famous watch and when the holy spirit is sitting there upon all those other cogs everything goes to circling and working the way that it was built to do you were built to worship him you were built to praise him you were built to pray you were built to get on your knees you were built to call almighty god but if something's not in place everything ain't operating the way it was built to operate but just go back down to the well and get another drink just get one more drink of it he said the enemy come to steal to kill and to rob you he said but i come to give you life and that should have it more abundantly he said i didn't he hadn't just given you the holy ghost so that you can live right for one service he's given you the holy ghost so that everything is in control and he's controlling you and you're not controlling him you see if you don't have that mainspring sitting there everything gets off time everything's off time you won't show up to worship at the right time you'll show up at 7 15 7 20 when the when the song leaders done got off when they said well i'll just go on i'll let the song leader go past this first 15 or 20 minutes and i'll just come in there and i'll sit down because the word is the important part i can miss the singing and still get it [Applause] what an idea the reason why you come in 20 minutes late it's because you don't have a mainspring that's working everything because if you had the mainspring you'd want that atmosphere in the first 15 minutes you see if you don't have that mainspring that's controlling you'll get off time you'll get lacks a days ago and say well god was doing that for days gone by or maybe god's doing that in the future but if you got the mainspring sitting there he'll say now are we the sons of god right now not some day in the future not some day going by not waiting for adoption we are the adopted sons of god we are placed we are anointed and we have power over every sickness over every devil over every disease over every circumstance he said wait a minute brother andrew you're getting a little you're having a little bit of audacity about that i know in whom i have believed and i know where i'm standing at it's not who i am but it's who i'm representing and if the body isn't moving in full operation you will never see your position over top of the enemy you see if you don't realize that you have been adopted and placed as a son of god the enemy will always hold that over your head and say that's for one day coming that is not for a day coming it's for you [Applause] well i listen to the message i play the tapes i come to church i do my part but i feel like i just haven't met jesus yet you see you can have the tapes you can have the pictures you can have all the quotes but if you don't have him the life giver the life sustainer you're all in all the alpha and omega you don't have anything [Applause] they said well they said what is it like brother andrew to meet jesus what's it like what's it like what was it like to meet him face to face some people have gone so far in the message and never met the god of the message let me tell you you meet jesus one time you don't have to try to figure out the bible anymore you don't have to try to place quotes and quotes and quotes on quotes on top of quotes he'll make this work but if you don't have the mainspring you'll never line up the quotes you'll have the head over top of the feet and not over top of the shoulders your puzzle will be off but meeting jesus is the greatest thing you'll ever do meeting jesus will make you love everybody meeting jesus will make you love your wife like never before meeting jesus will make you the best worker in your company meeting jesus will make you the best path player meeting jesus will make you the best worshiper meeting jesus will make you the best in your life [Applause] well that was fresh praise the lord anyhow notice that jesus said in john 14 and 20 he said at that day you shall know that i am in my father and you and me and i in you now notice verse 26 he said but the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever i have said unto you he will do this he'll come in my name he'll teach him my name he'll preach in my name and when you find somebody that is not preaching in the name of jesus and you find somebody that's not moving in the name of jesus they'll find somebody that's off the word somewhere but notice what he what he says in ezekiel he said that i will sanctify my name among the heathen that they might know that i am a holy god notice when when moses goes out there on the backside of the desert he goes out there and he's been out there for 40 years and he starts having a conversation with the bush and you think we're weird he starts talking to a bush and the bush starts talking back to him but this ain't some uh ordinary bush this bush is on fire but the bush is not consumed and the bush starts telling him to take his shoes off but where he's on holy ground and he begins to talk to him about his people you see what god was doing he was telling him where he came from and where he was going he began to tell him that i am thy god i seen you i was the god of abraham i was the god of isaac and i will be your god and he said well whom will i say that has sent me you tell them i am that i am and he starts telling him about what's in front of him he said how am i going to do these things and he starts asking him a question what do you got in your hand and he said what i got in my hand he said i got a rod and it throws rod down it becomes a snake he says pick it up again and it becomes a staff again you see that rod in moses's hand was different from any other rod that was in somebody else's hand somebody else had a shepherd's rod in their hand but moses had a judgment rod in his hand you see it wasn't moses's thick it was god's stick and when god moved on that stick supernatural things take place it touched a rock and there came water from a rock it touched water and water turned into blood you see when he would stretch forth that rod you see what it was doing he was showing the power of almighty god that god was over top of egypt and that god was controlling a man so much in the operation of the body of moses that he was identifying himself in human flesh again you see if those egyptians could ever got that rod out of moses's hand brother burnham said that they'd have got moses is whipped ain't a whip moses right there if they could only got that rod out of his hand could you imagine studying moses how we slept with that rod how he did so that they could get it out of his hand you know the enemy's studying you you think i'm off base by saying the enemy studying moses but the enemy is studying you trying to figure out how to get the name of jesus christ out of your grips he's trying to take the name of jesus christ off of your lips out of your praise out of your worship because he realizes that if he can ever get the name of jesus christ off of your lips he's got you whip right there but as long as that name is there satan can't move no further than the name of jesus christ will allow him he's trying to make you sick but the name of jesus christ keeps satan back you see moses was guarding that stick you think that's weird he was guarding that stick because it was more than just an ordinary stick let's just say this is a stain it's a moving stick he's guarding it with his life he's guarding it with his life he's going to sleep with it when moses goes when he goes just to have dinner with his family they said what's wrong with moses he ain't out there heard no sheep no more ain't i carry everything no more what's he carrying that thing for he was guarding that stick with his life because it represented something it represented something and you see too many times today men have not guarded the name of jesus christ or regarded the name of jesus christ in the power and the sincerity in which they do so men take the name of jesus christ in vain men joke about the name of jesus men mock the name of jesus they no longer regard the name of jesus christ anymore but we are to be married in that name buried in that name baptize in that name he would say over in colossians that whatever you do in word or deed do it all in the name of jesus christ it is a sacred name it is a holy name it is a pure name and god says i will sanctify my great name and when i sanctify my great name i will restore it people brother branham would say that the name of jesus christ and the godhead deity he's this cap toe the capstone revelation of the message because it's the greatest revelation that there is and when you go to guarding what is the most precious jewel you'll watch your life totally change you're not just packing somebody's name when you speak the name of jesus you are referring to the person of christ to the almighty god but too many times jesus becomes just a catchphrase jesus becomes just something that you put on your coffee go jesus comes something that you just hang anywhere you know something i absolutely i absolutely despise is that people go and put tracks and put their literature in a in a in a rest area on a urinal and that's got the name of jesus on it and they're placing the most holy name in the most disgusting place that there is what a way to witness at a toilet it's what people have been taught that that's okay now i know you think it's funny but realize the sacredness of the name of jesus that if you would really carry the power of that name and you would walk in dignity that you are identified in that name that you are married to the person of that name you handle yourself differently you pray differently yeah when you go to prayer and you begin to break into an atmosphere and you start calling on that name you start speaking that name over situations the name of jesus it makes satan leave the name of jesus christ will tell you that satan is defeated in the name of jesus christ there is healing in that name there is salvation in that name there is forgiveness in that name there is deliverance in that name strongholds are broke by that name paralytics walk by that name mountains move and are plucked and cast into the sea by that name prison doors fling wide by that name dead babies come to life by that name that name has given you power to bind the mamba that's tried to bite your brother and bite your sister that name of jesus christ tells hell to open up and give way in the name of jesus christ the name of jesus christ is the most holy name that there is ain't no other name under heaven or earth where men should be saved but by the name of jesus and there is coming a time where every knee shall bow and every toe shall confess that jesus christ is lord what is in the hand oh blessed be the name of the lord blessed be the name of the lord david said i will extol his name i will exalt his name i will glorify thy name isaiah said i will exalt his name i will glorify his name in the fires in my trials i will glorify his name i notice i'm gonna read you one more quote and we'll invite the musicians come but notice you've heard this before you've heard it but i want you to catch what brother branham says here he said now listen if the first time that the name of jesus was ever spoke through human lips made a dead baby come to life and jump for joy in a mother's womb what ought to do for the church that's claimed to be born again of the spirit what it ought to do for churches born again in the spirit i notice this how can a killer cancer stay there how can a killer cancer stay there how can a killer cataract how can a deaf or dumb spirit bind you when in my name they shall cast out devils hallelujah just don't doubt take his word like mary did and start rejoicing notice he begins to speak to the people in the prayer he said will you do that you that's going to be prayed for tonight will you as soon as the name of jesus is called on you will you begin to leap for joy saying praise god it's all over now hallelujah it's all gone now that i was speaking over to our pastor this week and we were listening to tape after tape after tape after tape going down going down the road and we were listening and brother branham would say just go on your own believing in the name of jesus christ just go on your road believer in the name of jesus christ but people want something so definitive that it's called out their name but it's that simple it's that simple he don't have to call your name you already know your name he don't have to call your address you know where you live at he don't have to call your situations you know what you're dealing with he don't have to call who you've been married to and who you've been living with you know your sin it's that simple tonight that if the name of jesus christ is spoke over you you can walk away completely whole because it's not your situation it's the name [Applause] [Music] strongholds are now being loosed what is it now i believe it now i receive it it's god moving across the people speaking in that name living in that name how can a killer cancer stay in your presence when you are an ambassador of heaven if we are the body moving under our headship then we must say what the head says we must believe what the head has said we must move where the head says move if he tells you to pray for this brother don't just wait for another moment get up right there and pray for that brother when you go to lifting up the name of jesus christ i want you to know that it'll bring every power down the name of jesus christ broke down a table one time brought down clothes and brought down a guitar what will it do over cancer that is nothing but a bluff what will it do over your situation when you speak that name as the musicians come i was a great missionary you all heard uh her name was david livingstone it was a great missionary over in africa and david livingstone was a was a doctor and he was going through the jungles and he was and he was he was going down through there and he came in contact with with the chief chief of the tribe and the chief he began to have a conversation with the chief and he began to speak with the chief and he began to talk to him back and forth and they made a blood covenant with one another and david livingstone and the chief they plucked their veins and they and they began to make a blood covenant david livingstone drunk half of it and the chief took the other half of it and it made a blood covenant between the two and because of this covenant they said what will you require of me and they and the chief said i'd like to have your i'd like to have your white coat that you wear he said now he said what would you require of me he said i'd like to have the spear that you carry the chief would carry because david recognized that he was going further on in his journey and david realized that the further he would get that he would run into different traps and when when those tribes would run out and go to kill him because he was the only white man those people didn't even know they were black until he got in their presence and they recognized so they would go out and try to kill him but when they recognized that spear they recognized that that was a chief spear and there had to be a blood covenant that had already been taken place and if you could realize that the enemies that are chasing you down and trying to kill you that you've got in your hand the spear of the chief of the king of kings his name is the name of names he is the lord of lords he is the king of kings he is the great and mighty god and when you go in that name you are packing a blood covenant and you are a covenant brother there is no power there is no power that can stand against that name what will these hands touch what will this mouth speak what prayers will be prayed what will your hands touch whose life will you touch god's wanting to operate through a body that's living and prophesying and speaking his name that the heathen might know that i am the holy god he didn't just start you to see where you would just go throughout your journey he had a purpose in mind he didn't just start the work to see if you would go all the way he knew you go all the way he isn't just okay with just letting you get healed and not make it to heaven he's not okay with a halfway work he's not okay with you living a halfway life he's wanting you to go all the way he's wanting you to move on in the spirit all blessed be the name of the lord let's stand together this evening i'll just go to praising him tonight go to speak in the name of jesus christ over your situation in your life amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah let's try to sing that song i'm going all the way all the way hallelujah all the way i'm going all the way [Music] all the way i'm going
