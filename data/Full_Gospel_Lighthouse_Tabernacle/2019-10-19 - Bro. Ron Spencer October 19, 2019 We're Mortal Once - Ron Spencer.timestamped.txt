[0:00] till tonight so I'm going to I'm going
[0:02] to deliver this sermon
[0:04] we're mortal once we're mortal once a
[0:10] man James 14 and 4 for 14 and I want to
[0:17] read that scripture just before I sorry
[0:19] I threw you a curveball but it's one
[0:21] Scripture but I want you to go to job 14
[0:25] James 4:14 is a favorite scripture of
[0:28] brother homers and you heard him quote
[0:31] it for so many times for those that were
[0:35] here whereas you know that not now know
[0:40] not what shall be on the morrow for what
[0:46] is your life it is even a vapor that
[0:50] appeareth for a little while a little
[0:53] time and then vanish it away but there
[1:00] Homer would use this statement it's like
[1:02] the vapor overtop of a teapot joke 14 in
[1:09] verse 1 now this only applies to if
[1:13] you're born of a woman so that gets us
[1:19] all a man that is born of a woman it's a
[1:27] few days notice these next words and
[1:31] full of trouble
[1:35] he that cometh forth like a flower and
[1:38] is cut down he fleeth also as a shadow
[1:42] and continue with naught and that's not
[1:46] thou dust thou open Dyne eyes upon such
[1:50] a one and bring us me into judgment with
[1:53] thee who can bring a clean pounding out
[1:57] of an unclean thing not one see if these
[2:01] days are determined the number of his
[2:03] months are with thee thou has appointed
[2:08] his bounds that he cannot pass turn from
[2:12] him that he might rest
[2:13] Teli he shall accomplish as a Highland
[2:18] his day for there is a hope of a tree if
[2:24] it be cut down that it will sprout again
[2:27] that the tender branch thereof will not
[2:31] cease though the root thereof wax old in
[2:36] the earth and stop there of dying the
[2:39] ground yet through the scent of water it
[2:44] will bud bring forth browse like a plant
[2:49] but man diet and wasted the way yeh man
[2:55] giveth up the ghost and where is he
[2:58] jobs having a conversation about his own
[3:01] mortality with God as the waters fail
[3:07] from the sea and the flood decay ahthe
[3:10] and dry it up so man laugh down and rise
[3:14] with not till heavens be no more
[3:17] they shall not awake nor be raised out
[3:20] of their sleep or that uh that thou wood
[3:24] has hide me in the grave that thou
[3:26] wouldest keep me in secret until they
[3:29] wrath be passed that thou wouldest
[3:32] anoint me set a time and remember me if
[3:37] a man die shall he live again all of the
[3:43] days of my appointed time will I wait
[3:46] till my change come thou shalt call and
[3:51] I will answer thee that will have a
[3:54] desire to work of nine hands you may be
[3:58] seated this afternoon quite a question
[4:07] wasn't it
[4:09] job is the oldest writings of the of the
[4:13] entire Bible and as a man he realized he
[4:17] was under the Adamic curse because
[4:20] they'd eaten offered the Tree of Life
[4:22] and it looked like to the human element
[4:27] man dies he wastes us the way you know
[4:32] even if you live to be nine hundred
[4:33] years old at that time there came a
[4:35] stage of old age and that age becomes
[4:42] golden it becomes very inconvenient it
[4:50] comes a time in your life to where your
[4:53] life is not out in the world so much
[4:56] until it's kind of it's kind of if we
[5:00] could say it institutional lives even
[5:02] their own homes it's around a kitchen a
[5:05] living room a bathroom and a place to
[5:12] sleep and you don't go very far from the
[5:15] bathroom are you with me now I think
[5:26] about people that have great great
[5:28] houses and great great places that they
[5:30] live in but at the end of the time if we
[5:33] come to a place like a nursing home
[5:35] we've only got a cubicle traitor of our
[5:42] life is Ronald Reagan was quite a
[5:45] precedent going to get into politics but
[5:48] he was he was a well renowned president
[5:50] but we came to the end of his life his
[5:53] last 10 years he lived and in a in a fog
[5:57] we would know that fog is all hi MERS
[5:59] and to which that he still thought he
[6:02] was a president and put on his suit
[6:04] every day and they they had an oval
[6:06] office in his home to which he went in
[6:08] and worked every day it was very private
[6:12] it was very it was very hidden from the
[6:14] world the family knew but the world
[6:18] didn't know
[6:19] but he was coming to the end of his life
[6:21] whatever it was he was coming to the end
[6:24] of his life Jesus would be the only one
[6:30] that could stand in two dimensions at
[6:34] the same time if we might say that he
[6:38] God became flesh or he with me now God
[6:44] became flesh and brother branham said
[6:47] Jesus was either God or his new greatest
[6:50] deceivers that there ever was Jesus was
[6:53] standing there with his disciples and he
[6:56] made this phenomenal statement he said
[7:00] let not your heart be troubled we use it
[7:03] as a funeral text many times let not
[7:06] your heart be troubled you believe in
[7:08] God believe also in me in my father's
[7:13] house are many mansions and if it were
[7:17] not so I would have told you I go to
[7:22] prepare a place for you and if I go and
[7:28] prepare a place for you I will come
[7:30] again and receive you unto myself that
[7:33] where I am there you may be also
[7:37] brother Branham would say that's not a
[7:39] place of brick and mortar in stones
[7:42] it's another body hallelujah are you
[7:50] with me now
[7:54] Jesus took those up on the mountain and
[7:58] then we said the disciples came unto Him
[8:00] and he opened his mouth and and taught
[8:02] them saying blessed are the poor in
[8:05] spirit for theirs is the kingdom of
[8:08] heaven blessed are they that mourn for
[8:12] they shall be comforted blessed are the
[8:15] meek for they shall inherit the earth
[8:18] blessed are they which do hunger and
[8:20] thirst after righteousness for they
[8:23] shall be filled
[8:24] blessed are the merciful for they shall
[8:27] obtain mercy
[8:29] blessed are the pure in heart
[8:32] for they shall see God blessed are the
[8:38] peacemakers for they shall be called the
[8:42] children of God verse 13 year the salt
[8:47] of the earth but if the salt has lost
[8:50] his Savior wherewith shall it be salted
[8:53] it is thenceforth good for nothing but
[8:56] to be cast out and to be trodden under
[8:58] the foot of men you're the light of the
[9:01] world a city that is set on a hill which
[9:04] cannot be hid
[9:06] neither do a man light a candle in and
[9:08] put it under a bushel but on a
[9:10] candlestick and it giveth light unto all
[9:13] that are in the house let your light so
[9:17] shine before men that they might see
[9:21] your good works and glorify the father
[9:25] which is in heaven
[9:29] the men would use this term he said
[9:31] you're reflecting your inheritance
[9:35] you're reflecting where you came from
[9:38] your life here is reflecting another
[9:42] world when I walk into McDonald's and I
[9:46] seen green hair and all different kind
[9:48] of I realize they're reflecting where
[9:54] they come from and where they're going
[9:57] and I also realize that this is not the
[10:02] hour of judgment this is the hour of
[10:05] light and so your presence will will
[10:11] maybe be a testimony to them and it may
[10:15] be the only witness or sermon they'll
[10:18] ever hear
[10:23] are you with me so brother madam said
[10:28] God produces kind after kind cow
[10:32] produces cattle horses produce horses
[10:36] camels produce camels but if God's going
[10:40] to give birth he produced his sons and
[10:43] daughters of God so Jesus would say I
[10:47] came from God and I'm going back to God
[10:51] and if we were in him that's our same
[10:55] origin and that's our same destination
[10:59] so we was predestinated to life from
[11:03] before the foundation of the world
[11:06] so God not only knew our beginning and
[11:11] our mortality but he also knew our end I
[11:19] would use this statement our future is
[11:23] clear I like that our future is clear
[11:33] now we came into this earth and we're
[11:38] born were born of woman so we come
[11:42] through the womb of a woman and I don't
[11:45] want to go into the birthing of it but I
[11:48] want you to understand the mother
[11:50] carries the egg the father carries the
[11:53] sperm which is the blood of life and
[11:56] brother Brandon would say in 100 million
[11:58] things that are to be future home he
[12:00] would go the last five sermons he would
[12:03] talk about the gene seed of God and he
[12:05] would begin to talk about the groaning
[12:07] of our birth birth pains will be a
[12:11] sermon that he'll speak on that even
[12:14] Jeremiah would talk about that he knew
[12:16] me before I was even formed in the belly
[12:22] God knew me David we'll talk about that
[12:26] God knew him before the foundation
[12:30] even when I was in secret the scripture
[12:33] talked about but our mother will will
[12:36] begin to carry life and will get excited
[12:40] about she's carrying life and then that
[12:43] life will will come to a place to where
[12:46] it's ready to be born
[12:48] but in that secure world where that baby
[12:52] is born it don't wanna leave mama's womb
[12:57] serves the process of dropping to a spot
[13:01] and you'll hear sisters ghost she's
[13:04] dropped she's dropped you women to pay
[13:11] more attention to those girls with that
[13:13] situation than I do I don't know what
[13:16] they're talking about she's dropped it's
[13:18] gonna happen in a couple of days I know
[13:20] that about cattle so I and but what is
[13:28] happening that maybe has come to a spot
[13:31] to where it's going to be forced from
[13:34] the womb are you with me now now you
[13:38] don't know anything about being in there
[13:42] neither do you know anything about being
[13:44] in the mind of God but how did you know
[13:49] your name your mother and father told
[13:51] you your name and you believed them how
[13:54] did you know you came from God God told
[13:57] you and we believe him Galileo and we
[14:05] were forced from our mother's womb now
[14:10] that's the beginning of mortal life but
[14:14] on the other end of it we'll be forced
[14:17] and they'll be groaning that takes place
[14:20] from this realm to go to that room are
[14:27] you with me
[14:30] now I don't know about you but I have a
[14:34] deep desire to go there I have a deep
[14:39] longing to go there that's my goal I've
[14:47] never been there but it's become such a
[14:50] reality so whatever time on my earth
[14:57] this days it is about being there those
[15:05] words are important Jesus would say this
[15:09] because he being God in flesh I am the
[15:14] resurrection and life what a statement I
[15:20] am the bread of life I am my father are
[15:26] one he would come to a spot to where he
[15:31] would say I have finished the work
[15:35] thirty three and a half years what a
[15:39] space of time only a condensed space of
[15:43] time but in the space of that time it
[15:47] had such a strain and such a stress on
[15:50] that mortal piece of clay until he
[15:53] looked like a man past fifty why because
[15:58] he had the sin of the whole world the
[16:01] strain of all humanity was on him
[16:04] and if he doesn't complete or accomplish
[16:09] the work we're lost and yet he has to be
[16:15] put under every temptation that man can
[16:18] face every strain of devil that man can
[16:21] face and he has to overcome at all
[16:30] now the scripture says that he would he
[16:35] would tell and I didn't look to
[16:37] something forgive me but he would tell
[16:41] especially a lady that washes his feet
[16:45] go send no more in that moment in that
[16:58] moment of that conversation with the
[17:01] Messiah and that woman she was changed
[17:06] from a prostitute are you remember
[17:11] that's how she got the money to come
[17:13] what wash his feet under the Old
[17:18] Testament she would have just repeated
[17:20] the process but under the Messiahship
[17:25] when he speaks to her he speaks the life
[17:30] to her go and sin no more
[17:34] that Dominion has no more dominion over
[17:37] you anymore
[17:42] come on Church because he was the breath
[17:46] of life he was the expression of God
[17:50] said another piece of clay and thousands
[17:55] even millions saw him in the flesh but
[17:58] missed who he was how many people miss
[18:02] who you are would you just think about
[18:12] this it be a prophet that would tell us
[18:16] that you're one in a million
[18:17] and then he would begin to describe to
[18:20] you that 999,000 that being one in a
[18:27] million
[18:28] all of those other seeds die they die
[18:36] jubilee happens because once it comes to
[18:39] life but that nine nine nine nine nine
[18:42] nine nine whatever perish no fear Ross
[18:53] nobody cries no weeping but those are
[18:57] rejoicing for the one don't you just
[19:06] think about this brother Brandon would
[19:08] use a term I'm trying to be cautious
[19:12] brother Brandon would use a term how
[19:16] that God watched over our seed he
[19:21] preserved it even since Adam he would
[19:25] use the term called that we were
[19:26] pre-planned of God he would say that
[19:31] we're the living physical attributes of
[19:34] God that he thought of before the
[19:37] foundation of the world God watched over
[19:43] that so he knew we were coming and like
[19:51] a father and mother they prepare a room
[19:55] God prepared for you he's also preparing
[20:01] for you
[20:01] lay a great wedding supper there won't
[20:06] be one extra seat but I'd like to just
[20:14] take just a negative side here just for
[20:16] a moment brother Branham called all
[20:18] humanity flesh the unredeemable flesh
[20:22] fodder that's a pretty difficult
[20:27] statement but it's just the reality for
[20:32] me dearly described grace to you you've
[20:34] got to realize there's a lot of lost
[20:41] let me just give you a couple of facts
[20:45] in the last hundred years in the Battle
[20:49] of war a hundred and eight million
[20:54] soldiers have given their life in the
[20:58] last hundred years that's a lot of
[21:01] people it's estimated that 1 billion
[21:08] people have give their life due to Wars
[21:16] since Adam it's a lot of father I made
[21:29] the statement in Switzerland a few years
[21:34] ago and brother gido was sitting he was
[21:37] sitting there and I turned to brother G
[21:40] do and I said get oh I don't know your
[21:42] history about 400 people I said brother
[21:46] gido I don't know your history but when
[21:49] your grandfather was at war he said I
[21:55] know my grandfather was at war he said I
[22:00] didn't know that my parent my
[22:03] grandfather was at war no doubt he'll
[22:06] watch the service but he said I didn't
[22:08] know he said but when you said it that
[22:12] God watched over my natural seed while
[22:15] your grandfather was at war he said that
[22:19] became alive to me he said my
[22:21] grandfather must have been at war and he
[22:26] said God watched over him and not a
[22:28] bullet could destroy his life because he
[22:32] was carrying G those seed of life and
[22:38] about a month or two brother Dino sent
[22:40] me a picture and it was in an envelope
[22:43] he sent me a picture here's my
[22:45] grandfather
[22:47] that was carrying my seed of life I
[22:50] would say many of us sitting here
[22:52] tonight whether it was the American
[22:55] Revolution or the Civil War or the wars
[22:59] that we fought of late our fathers was
[23:02] carrying our life they can tell where
[23:19] you came from
[23:20] by your DNA markers they can tell whose
[23:25] Kenda who by the DNA markers they've got
[23:29] it down but that's not a new thing for
[23:31] God that's not a new thing for God God
[23:39] knows all the way back to the beginning
[23:41] and he knows your time of life I want
[23:45] you to listen brother Branham census
[23:47] we're all they going to be mortal watts
[23:52] what a statement this is this is the
[23:55] last time for all eternity will ever be
[23:59] mortal this may be the last night that
[24:09] will ever be mortal tomorrow we may be
[24:15] immortal so let's do what we can for
[24:19] mortal beings while we're mortal and can
[24:24] help them
[24:25] let's work while it's called day from
[24:29] night cometh when no man can work
[24:33] God doesn't forget his children he swore
[24:38] by himself he said he said oh I just
[24:41] can't go on satisfied I mustn't go by
[24:44] myself these hands will only be mortal
[24:49] once these lips will only be mortal
[24:53] watch
[24:55] the scripture said the grave can't
[24:58] praise Him
[25:01] [Music]
[25:04] my brother my sister you will only be
[25:07] mortal once he said you don't know how I
[25:13] I would like to take time take every man
[25:18] here and go eat with you sit down and
[25:22] talk with you talk about heaven about
[25:24] Jesus I would love to do that time won't
[25:29] permit it but I'll make an appointment
[25:32] with you when we step out of time into
[25:37] eternity I want a thousand years with
[25:41] each one of you and when I get through
[25:45] I'll have no less time than what I did
[25:49] to begin with are you listening I get
[26:00] badgered a little bit by my close
[26:02] friends when we're preaching conventions
[26:05] and I've made this statement before I
[26:08] made it here oh how I'd like to come to
[26:10] your house and maybe drink your coffee
[26:13] set on your porch and eat your
[26:16] chocolates and the next day at the
[26:22] service will be a box of chocolates but
[26:30] one day we'll be in a round to where we
[26:34] can make that appointment and spend a
[26:36] thousand years together you ever been
[26:42] around somebody that after five minutes
[26:44] there's nothing more to say you can help
[26:50] me preach
[26:52] after an hour two hours some people
[26:54] never run out of words yes just just
[27:00] continue to go on and on and on not
[27:03] necessary I'm still listening that's
[27:09] where you fix your car I was together
[27:18] with a special friend the other day and
[27:20] someone was sharing their life story
[27:22] with them but I could tell he wasn't
[27:24] clicked in so after we were gone and
[27:28] that was all over with I just asked him
[27:30] I said where did you click out and he
[27:31] said well when they got to a place it
[27:35] was no longer fruitful I just decided I
[27:38] would try to figure out what I was
[27:39] preaching tomorrow well now you know
[27:47] some of our secrets and when we get
[27:59] through it we'll have no less time than
[28:01] when I did when I began but now it's
[28:06] night and it's the day of man daylight
[28:11] comes the day of the Lord
[28:13] now we must labor I can't be a servant
[28:18] of man and a servant of God at the same
[28:23] time I must serve God so I can win men
[28:32] to his creator God so that we can keep
[28:38] that appointment
[28:40] I read that quote because we must keep
[28:44] that appointment many times we we think
[28:52] oh well I'll break the appointment at
[28:54] the dentist or I'll break the
[28:55] appointment at the at the veterinarian
[29:00] clinic I'll break that appointment one
[29:03] appointment you
[29:03] keep brother and says we want everything
[29:12] just just everything so we can take it
[29:17] easy and retire and take life easy life
[29:25] wasn't intended to be easy life is a
[29:30] struggle anything that's got life and it
[29:36] is struggling look at the trees how they
[29:39] struggle look at everything that's got
[29:43] life it's a struggle and when we try to
[29:50] get some kind of a system that takes it
[29:53] easy and we're wrong I get to clean a
[29:59] chimney for a man that was at one time
[30:03] the vice president of the Radford Army
[30:06] Ammunition Plant and I when I would go I
[30:12] went there for years I think I went
[30:14] there 15 years to its place every year
[30:17] he was he was in the bed through the
[30:24] years who you build up relationships I
[30:28] don't know if it was the last year of
[30:30] the year before that I asked him a
[30:33] question I said how did you get here
[30:36] because I knew that he was a vice
[30:39] president of the company and he's a well
[30:41] looked up to man they said how did you
[30:44] get up to here and he said I'll tell you
[30:46] what happened when I retired I give up
[30:52] he said I thought my life is over and he
[30:56] said I'd go and set my car but I had
[30:58] nowhere to go and after a while I got
[31:02] tired of sitting in my car and he said I
[31:05] just stated Beth that's not even
[31:11] existence you got a struggle to keep
[31:17] your life I don't like a treadmill but I
[31:23] have excited that it's changed my life I
[31:27] don't know if it'll add a day or an hour
[31:29] or a week I don't know anything about
[31:33] that all I know is there's a time for me
[31:36] but this life I must try to keep myself

[35:56] heart so he did not go worried about his
[36:05] heart but instead of enjoying life
[36:09] somebody help me preach he was afraid to
[36:13] mow his own yard because he was
[36:28] you know I sometimes take that way about
[36:30] people sitting in church you thought I
[36:35] would leave that alone the crossed arms
[36:40] and said let somebody a man the same man
[36:43] let somebody else worship the Lord
[36:44] that's somebody else saying let somebody
[36:47] else pay their tithe like somebody else
[36:48] do the things this is not a spectator
[36:51] sport
[36:52] [Applause]
[37:01] hallelujah you have to fight through
[37:06] Laodicea and you could just succumb to
[37:13] the idea of sloppy easy living or us me
[37:21] and just an entertainment gospel but
[37:24] that's not over commerce of this bright
[37:28] edge we must have determination and a
[37:36] will to do the Father's will to destroy
[37:39] the works of the devil
[37:52] brother Bram said you're only mortal
[37:54] once and that one time is the only time
[37:58] that you're going to be mortal and this
[38:01] may be the time that you've got to make
[38:03] your decision you're either going to
[38:08] move up with God or stay where you're at
[38:14] brother Branham says this he said
[38:16] this'll Worth Lita burn out go here you
[38:19] know what it is this body is like an old
[38:22] coat that you wear a coat that you want
[38:26] swear but now you have one that is so
[38:30] much better you don't use it anymore
[38:34] what do you do you hang it in a closet
[38:37] for you've got a better one you got a
[38:41] you got a better coat it's more up today
[38:45] than the one you used to wear that's
[38:47] worn out what it is that it is that
[38:51] garment and you are inside of that there
[38:55] that garment only done what it bore your
[39:00] image you won't need that no more you've
[39:07] hung it up and it's a rag
[39:12] that's the way this old body is I know a
[39:15] lot of us prep it and take care of it
[39:18] you better there's only one you got are
[39:23] you waiting I saw sign the other day if
[39:24] I knew I was gonna live this long and
[39:26] took better care of myself it's the only
[39:32] one you got and that's the way this body
[39:40] is it's more the image of the heavenly
[39:44] yes it is not you
[39:46] you're the inside of that body the
[39:50] Spirit of God is only inside of that
[39:52] body and that's what makes the outside
[39:55] come into subjection because the inside
[39:59] is pulling it bringing into the line of
[40:02] the word it's you're inside you're
[40:05] inside your being this body is just an
[40:11] old coat and someday what would you do
[40:15] with it for you as the garment for a
[40:17] while that is like this earthly garment
[40:20] this body your real body your real self
[40:23] is on the inside of this old goat
[40:27] brother haven't said you've never seen
[40:29] me and I've never seen you I don't care
[40:35] what kind of walls
[40:40] I better not go there someday I will
[40:48] hang in the Earth's Hall of memory of
[40:51] you that's quite a statement someday
[40:56] it'll hang in Earth's Hall of memory of
[41:01] you you'll put it out yonder in a grave
[41:05] and someday we'll be put a stone up said
[41:09] here lies Reverend so-and-so or John so
[41:12] and so or so and so and so and so it'll
[41:15] I there as a memorial of you the people
[41:19] just seeing you in this what you was
[41:22] your real you what was on the inside of
[41:26] that but that old code itself just bore
[41:30] the image of the heavenly
[41:32] old people have you major restoration to
[41:36] change your coat
[41:40] have you made reservations for heaven
[41:44] remember you must have reverent
[41:46] reservations you can't get in without
[41:51] them he said I'm talking in modern
[41:56] language now that you know if you go to
[41:59] a hotel you have to have reservations so
[42:06] did you have reservations
[42:07] well I'm sorry everything is filled up
[42:12] you're the old coat because you failed
[42:18] to make reservations there's nothing
[42:25] more disappointing in preaching a sermon
[42:26] in a funeral to where people have made
[42:32] reservations
[42:36] that funerals not the time to judge it's
[42:39] the time to comfort it's the time to
[42:43] give hope but you can't do one think
[42:48] about the person in the casket
[42:58] Ecclesiastes chapter 9 and verse 4 says
[43:02] a living dog a living dog
[43:08] it's better than a dead lion let's go on
[43:13] statement a living dog is better than a
[43:18] dead lion said life is a precious thing
[43:25] in its humblest form it's greater than
[43:31] tell it is better to be least in the
[43:41] kingdom then greatest outside of it hey
[43:51] I want to just nail some things tonight
[43:53] I'm home I'm gonna nail some things it
[43:56] is better to be the least in the kingdom
[44:00] then the greatest outside of it are you
[44:07] with me
[44:08] you young girls and young boys to sing
[44:11] God thinks more of your talent then Lady
[44:18] gaga
[44:29] I was in a conversation here while back
[44:34] and they was talking about this person
[44:35] actually it wasn't long ago just a few
[44:39] days ago you can go back and listen this
[44:41] whole thirteen-year-old girl walks up
[44:44] and she literally blows the congregation
[44:47] away with her incredible god-given
[44:51] talent and there were some statements
[44:55] that was made set off a talent scout
[44:57] would get a hold of that and I said a
[45:00] talent scout would send her to hell that
[45:06] might seem horrible but let me just say
[45:08] this you it'll put you on a path it'll
[45:15] put you on a path that'll take you the
[45:18] wrong way Oh wasn't that great that that
[45:26] person won American Idol erm oneness or
[45:28] why not no I'll tell you that's the
[45:31] greatest detriment that just happened to
[45:32] that individual they've just signed a
[45:36] contract with Satan himself
[45:50] I just prayed for a young man that said
[45:56] I have an opportunity to go pearl I said
[46:00] really he said I can go pearl in
[46:04] baseball he said what should I do I said
[46:07] you're asking the wrong one I'm looking
[46:10] for soldiers in the kingdom of God that
[46:13] inherit eternal life that's what I'm
[46:16] recruiting for I'm actually a recruiting
[46:19] agent for men that want to serve God for
[46:24] eternity
[46:33] I look a little things a little
[46:43] differently I'm sorry
[46:47] sometimes you see stars and their wife
[46:51] it's just a trophy bride then they've
[46:57] got a monstrous house and maybe a 40
[46:59] million dollar mansion but if I could
[47:03] ask you what the scripture says what is
[47:06] the end of it brother Branham said there
[47:12] were two men brothers what was gen one
[47:14] was John is it one lived beside the
[47:17] tracks the other lived in Chicago and he
[47:19] was quite a banker he was quite a top
[47:21] civilized man who had a great education
[47:25] he become the president of the bank and
[47:28] this one went up to see him and when he
[47:32] got there his wife wasn't home and he
[47:36] said they were standing at the front
[47:37] door and he was showing him everything
[47:39] that he owned his monstrous house and he
[47:42] was showing me and he said if you stand
[47:44] right here you can see the top of the
[47:45] bank where I'm the president and he said
[47:48] this is what all I owned and after a
[47:50] little while his wife walked in and
[47:52] she'd been out at a party all night long
[47:54] and she was dressed like she'd been at a
[47:56] party and she walks in he thought about
[47:59] his own wife and children at home he
[48:01] couldn't hardly feed him his wife was
[48:03] trustworthy she was a real lady probably
[48:07] didn't have a new new dress in her whole
[48:09] closet nobody listening to brother I'm
[48:11] tell this story and he's telling him
[48:14] about all that he owned
[48:15] when he came down to the end his brother
[48:18] I asked him how much do you own up there
[48:28] a living dog is greater than a dead lion
[48:34] the thief on the cross as he was
[48:38] breathing was greater than Caesar come
[48:45] on what would you give in exchange for
[48:50] yourself I think about many years ago
[49:11] many years ago I was in a meeting and a
[49:16] young man he said I could go and make
[49:24] more money in a week or two and I could
[49:27] make in a year here but I have to be
[49:34] away from home and they live a
[49:37] completely different lifestyle I just
[49:43] simply asked him why are you asking me
[49:45] the question actually your
[49:50] brother-in-law was standing beside of me
[49:54] Paulo Fontaine when I answered this
[49:56] young man's question
[50:05] we're out so our wheel in God's will
[50:08] but to me it's no match to me it's no
[50:14] match you gain the whole world and
[50:20] you've lost yourself what do you have
[50:30] Homer would say no new house behind
[50:33] hearses a man remarked one time he said
[50:44] if he knew that he had 30 years of life
[50:47] before him it would not be an unwise
[50:51] thing to spend 20 years of those years
[50:55] of the thirty mapping out a plan of
[51:00] living and putting himself under rule
[51:03] for what he could do with ten years well
[51:09] arranged then thirty years spent
[51:14] haphazardly a man will do little by
[51:22] himself if that life isn't channeled by
[51:26] God I found this last weekend or
[51:34] actually three weeks ago and it's just
[51:39] kept resounding back to me and I want to
[51:41] share this with you Spurgeon shares this
[51:49] he says there are hounds up on the track
[51:53] of every thief murderer liar in
[52:00] foot upon every center of every time
[52:04] each sin leaves a trail the dogs of
[52:12] judgment will be sure to sin it out and
[52:14] find their prey
[52:16] there is no disentangling yourselves
[52:21] from the meshes of guilt no possibility
[52:26] of evading the penalty of transgressions
[52:30] very wonderful have been the ways in
[52:34] which persons who have committed crimes
[52:38] and have been brought to judgment
[52:40] a trifle becomes the telltale the method
[52:49] of deceit gives a clue of the manner of
[52:51] discovery wretched the men who bury
[52:55] their secrets in their own bosoms their
[52:59] own conscious plays traitor to them your
[53:06] sins will find you out
[53:16] we have rhythm thread of men taking
[53:20] their sleep to their fellows and
[53:21] babbling in their dreams the crime that
[53:25] they committed years before God would
[53:32] have this secret disclosed no I have
[53:37] seen neither could other tongue have
[53:40] been bold but the man turned Kings
[53:43] evidence against him selves he has thus
[53:47] brought himself to judgment listen only
[53:50] the blood of Jesus Christ can we men
[53:56] sense
[53:58] are you with me Spurgeon said do i
[54:05] address anyone who is now practicing a
[54:08] secret sin you would not have me to
[54:14] point you out for the whole world to see
[54:17] nor do I believe me that sin is no can I
[54:28] read that to you again
[54:30] Spurgeon is preaching to 12,000 people
[54:33] at his auditorium metropolitan
[54:35] auditorium and he's just made new
[54:38] statements before and he said do I
[54:41] address anyone who is now practicing
[54:43] secret sin and he was not a prophet like
[54:48] brother Branham but brother Branham
[54:55] could stand arrow in the prayer lines
[54:58] and see your entire life
[55:02] brother Bisco said I was sitting on the
[55:05] log and he said he was less though he
[55:07] was looking right straight through me
[55:10] you know and you've had special moments
[55:13] in time where God became so real you
[55:15] knew you couldn't hide anything I'd like
[55:20] to say this to you deal with it now
[55:33] said you would not have me to point out
[55:36] you out to the whole world nobody nobody
[55:41] wants to be shamed or blamed nobody
[55:44] wants to be and we don't want to do that
[55:48] we don't do that but you know can I say
[55:54] that you know and he said believe me the
[56:02] sin is known all right with me I knew
[56:10] you wouldn't be shouting tonight but
[56:18] Grant said you might have to make your
[56:20] decision tonight if it is I pray that
[56:25] you'll throw everything you'll throw
[56:29] everything loose remember I don't care
[56:31] what it is if it's a job if it's a
[56:33] family if it's loved ones if it's
[56:36] associates if it's your partners whoever
[56:40] it is turn loose of everything even that
[56:44] he that puts his hand to the plow and
[56:47] turns to look back is not worthy of the
[56:50] plowing lay aside every weight and the
[56:54] sin was just so easily beset you what is
[56:59] it lay aside every weight the unbelief
[57:01] that does so easily beset you and run
[57:05] this race with the patience that is set
[57:09] before you nobody else can run for you
[57:14] nobody else could take your place you
[57:19] can't take Billy Graham's place Billy
[57:21] Graham can't take your place
[57:39] choosing of a bride brother Brennan says
[57:41] in many things of life were given a
[57:44] choice the way of life itself is a
[57:48] choice we have a right to make our own
[57:52] way choose your own way that we want to
[57:57] live
[57:58] education is a choice we can choose
[58:01] whether we're going to be educated or
[58:03] whether we're not going to be educated
[58:06] that's a choice that we have right and
[58:10] wrong is a choice every man every woman
[58:14] every boring girl has to choose whether
[58:16] they're going to try to live right or
[58:19] not live right choice is a great thing
[58:24] your eternal destination is a choice and
[58:28] maybe tonight some of you will make that
[58:30] choice of of where you'll spend eternity
[58:33] this is coming from season of a bride he
[58:36] said before the service ends tonight
[58:38] there will be one time that if you turn
[58:41] God turn down turn God down many times
[58:45] there will be one time that you'll turn
[58:48] him down the last time all brother run
[58:53] but I got dealt with me but I escaped it
[58:58] and he may never do again he said there
[59:07] is a line between mercy and judgment
[59:10] Billy Andrews stood in his pulpit many
[59:12] years ago and he said was preaching in
[59:16] the tenth meeting and he was coming down
[59:19] and he was preaching and it was
[59:20] preaching and he came down to the altar
[59:24] call and he started counting ten nine
[59:28] eight and two kids teenagers that were
[59:33] dating two kids got up and was very
[59:36] irreverent and they walked out the tent
[59:38] and he said
[59:42] it's her last time I'm pleading with you
[59:47] come to God
[59:53] I'm only telling the story help me and
[1:00:00] they laughed anything as a matter of
[1:00:03] fact one of the Deacons went to those
[1:00:04] children and those people said he's
[1:00:07] calling you it may be your last time and
[1:00:10] they laughed at him and they went down
[1:00:12] the road less than five miles and they
[1:00:16] missed a stop sign and ran and took
[1:00:18] cliff and it was 54 inches from the
[1:00:22] front bumper to the back bumper for
[1:00:33] mortal once I set in the restaurant but
[1:00:39] the Mike Price and myself a set in the
[1:00:41] restaurant and the man said he was there
[1:00:44] when Elvis Presley said in that and he
[1:00:48] pointed at a at a corner said he said in
[1:00:51] that corner right over there and play
[1:00:52] music and said there'd be a lot of
[1:00:55] people come to play music with him and
[1:00:57] they would dance and he would sit there
[1:00:58] as a boy I was sitting in that
[1:01:01] restaurant know Elvis Presley only a
[1:01:06] memory and in the dimension where he's
[1:01:10] at
[1:01:12] there's no mercy but you remember there
[1:01:18] were three preachers that dealt with him
[1:01:20] before he died and he told all three of
[1:01:24] them
[1:01:24] I sold my birthright for popularity and
[1:01:31] money and women he told them all those
[1:01:34] three things and I can't get back to God
[1:01:37] what a place I don't want to be on that

[1:01:48] tonight but gods in a business whether

[1:04:25] what man costs Greg black calls foolish
[1:04:31] [Applause]
[1:04:55] brother branham had an experience that
[1:04:57] was beyond the curtain of time do you
[1:05:01] mind if I just take the time to read
[1:05:02] this adjust
[1:05:17] he just breaks in I'm just gonna break
[1:05:19] into the vision or actually translation
[1:05:23] he says I was watching and every one of
[1:05:26] those women coming up and hugging me
[1:05:27] saying all precious brother we're so
[1:05:30] glad to see you and I thought everyone
[1:05:33] dressed just a little like but they had
[1:05:37] their hair you know red hair black hair
[1:05:39] blond hair they was coming by and they
[1:05:43] was all young and when she got to me I
[1:05:48] thought I'm just gonna see what she says
[1:05:51] and she looked at me and she said our
[1:05:54] precious brother she hugged me and we
[1:05:57] just went on and other woman who came
[1:05:59] and hugged me next heard noise I I
[1:06:02] looked over this way and Here Come
[1:06:04] another bunch of men young young fellows
[1:06:07] all in the age about 20 they had dark
[1:06:09] hair blonde hair
[1:06:11] they all had white robes on barefooted
[1:06:14] and they run to me and begin to hugging
[1:06:17] me and hollering precious brother and I
[1:06:20] thought and I turned back around and
[1:06:22] there I was still laying there and I
[1:06:24] thought this is strange just then a
[1:06:28] voice was talking to me and I never did
[1:06:30] see it the voice it said you have been
[1:06:34] gathered you have been gathered to your
[1:06:37] people and and and then some man picked
[1:06:40] me up set me up this way in a big high
[1:06:43] thing like this I said why did you do
[1:06:46] that in Earth he was a leader I said I I
[1:06:53] don't understand this and the voice was
[1:06:56] talking to me I I never could see the
[1:06:59] voice now it was just above me it was
[1:07:01] talking to me I said well if I had
[1:07:05] passed on I want to see Jesus he was so
[1:07:10] he was all my life and I want to see him
[1:07:13] and so he said you can't see him now he
[1:07:19] is a little higher you see it was just
[1:07:24] below the altar the sixth place where
[1:07:26] men go not the seventh where God is in
[1:07:29] that set
[1:07:29] to mention it was a six and they were
[1:07:33] they were all there and they were
[1:07:34] passing by and look like they were just
[1:07:37] actually millions of them I never seen
[1:07:40] them and I sit there and these women and
[1:07:42] men running by and hugging me calling me
[1:07:44] brother I sit there and that voice said
[1:07:47] you have been gathered to your people
[1:07:49] like Jacob was gathered to his people I
[1:07:52] said all these my people are they all
[1:07:55] branham's know they're your converts to
[1:07:58] Christ and I looked around and there
[1:08:02] were real pretty woman ran up and she
[1:08:05] just about about the same and she threw
[1:08:08] her arm around me she said oh my
[1:08:09] precious brother she looked at me and
[1:08:12] she said my she looked like an angel and
[1:08:16] she passed by and the voice said didn't
[1:08:18] you recognize her no I didn't recognize
[1:08:22] her you let her to Christ when she was
[1:08:26] past 90 you know why she thanks so much
[1:08:33] of you that pretty girl was past 90
[1:08:38] you're talking about laying off an old
[1:08:40] coat yeah that pretty girl was past 90
[1:08:53] listen up brother branham is he even
[1:08:55] that pretty girl was past 90 yeah she
[1:09:02] can never change no more now
[1:09:06] I got a lot of thoughts right here not a
[1:09:12] lot of thoughts one of those thoughts is
[1:09:15] I've got more to go to heaven for then I
[1:09:18] had yesterday
[1:09:28] I think the sister Benton just now she's
[1:09:34] just on this dimension breathe in her
[1:09:36] last breaths maybe even tonight maybe
[1:09:39] already gone since service started
[1:09:41] breathing her last breaths she's no more
[1:09:44] conscious she's done past that stage of
[1:09:46] consciousness but it's not over and the
[1:09:51] man that sang in this pulpit for years
[1:09:53] and years and decades I just want to be
[1:09:57] a blessing I just want to be a blessing
[1:10:00] if he would send it in some games maybe
[1:10:03] you even thought will he ever quit
[1:10:04] singing that song and somebody would get
[1:10:07] happy about it and and he and he'd start
[1:10:09] and he'd go and he'd sing it again and
[1:10:12] and if somebody else got blessed he'd
[1:10:14] sing it again and maybe some of you were
[1:10:16] born
[1:10:17] others were made happy and he told his
[1:10:21] wife just two days ago he said it won't
[1:10:24] be long now and I won't be far behind
[1:10:30] why we've heard about a dimension where
[1:10:35] an 80 year old woman steps into a new
[1:10:37] body even brother Branham couldn't
[1:10:42] recognize the woman that he led to
[1:10:44] Christ just only just only a matter of
[1:10:46] time ago and now it's hand even realized
[1:10:49] who she was
[1:10:50] oh brother on but that's brother branham
[1:10:53] story well let's just take the scripture
[1:10:55] two men on the road to Emmaus and they
[1:11:00] walk with Jesus for six hours and can't
[1:11:03] recognize him I say many times people
[1:11:10] have come to this church and sit in
[1:11:12] these pews and wind through service and
[1:11:14] maybe you thought it was almost like
[1:11:16] rapture and they went I didn't get
[1:11:19] nothing out of it it depends on which
[1:11:25] Dominion you're feeding from
[1:11:39] sister Carol Kinser been a freshest
[1:11:43] friend of our family for many many years
[1:11:45] Sammy and I started out ministering
[1:11:48] together and he preached a phenomenal
[1:11:53] preacher about 60 years old he goes up
[1:11:59] gets into tree stands with these
[1:12:00] grandsons and he gets in the tree stand
[1:12:05] but today would be his last day it's a
[1:12:11] very hard thing on his grandchildren
[1:12:14] they didn't know it was his last day you
[1:12:23] know sometimes we just don't know
[1:12:25] sometimes we have an idea sometimes we
[1:12:29] don't know one morning I got up and the
[1:12:33] Lord spoke to me said it's time to go to
[1:12:35] brother Steve's bedside today's the last
[1:12:40] conversation you'll have you don't know
[1:12:44] what it felt like to drive down that
[1:12:45] driveway and I knew the few moments that
[1:12:52] I would have with him would be our last
[1:12:55] you're talking about making it effective
[1:12:59] he sat there but the Jeff I'm sure you
[1:13:02] can remember this he sat there and he
[1:13:06] said remember that vision you had about
[1:13:08] 20-30 years ago of me and I said yes
[1:13:14] Steve he said remember I got there first
[1:13:16] I was walking down the road with Thomas
[1:13:24] and a man named Jim and a man named Dan
[1:13:31] Dyer Jim
[1:13:41] you don't my real men and I'm walking
[1:13:45] down the road and we come to a spot and
[1:13:47] there stands Steve and he's stand-in
[1:13:50] there and he said I'd like to give you
[1:13:53] some angel food heavenly manna I was
[1:14:01] setting talking to him in a wheelchair
[1:14:05] and I was thinking about many years ago
[1:14:09] way before I was ever a pastor here God
[1:14:15] told me that we would meet an eternity
[1:14:21] and he also told me in that vision
[1:14:24] whether I even recognized or not he
[1:14:26] would beat me there and now I'm having a
[1:14:30] conversation with him about a vision
[1:14:32] that I had almost 30 years before you
[1:14:36] talking about blending of time and
[1:14:37] eternity Steve and I converse ated for a
[1:14:42] bit and they were setting up the bed and
[1:14:44] you remember they were setting up the
[1:14:45] bed in there in the room setting up the
[1:14:47] bed and he he just knew his time was
[1:14:49] close it time was at hand
[1:14:51] listen they'd listen to brother branham
[1:14:53] and sermons all through the night he's
[1:14:55] believer and remember we we took the
[1:15:00] video of brother Homer preaching his
[1:15:02] memorial service while he was in
[1:15:06] Fontaine we got him dressed up and
[1:15:10] combed his hair he forgot to put his
[1:15:12] teeth in if you remember he preached
[1:15:16] about about 12 minutes if I have it
[1:15:19] right and do you have that do you guys
[1:15:23] have that okay make sure you have that
[1:15:28] below Mr preached and he said may during
[1:15:32] this service something supernatural
[1:15:33] happened because Steve was a believer
[1:15:38] you may think I'm out on a limb but
[1:15:41] we're only mortal once we're only more
[1:15:46] to watch and while andrew was preaching
[1:15:49] here and he was preaching the pillar of
[1:15:53] fire came across your flower sister Judy
[1:15:56] and the bulbs just opened up I love it
[1:16:03] here with me now your last breath here
[1:16:07] is the first one there I'd say we're
[1:16:12] winners
[1:16:22] I thought all my brother Ben says oh my
[1:16:39] and I was afraid of this why these
[1:16:45] people are real they wasn't going
[1:16:50] anywhere they wasn't tired of being
[1:16:53] there why can't I see Jesus well well
[1:16:59] now he will come someday and he'll come
[1:17:02] to you first and then you'll be judged
[1:17:03] and these people are your converts that
[1:17:06] you have led you mean by being a leader
[1:17:09] that he'll judge me yes does every
[1:17:12] leader have to be judged like that yes
[1:17:14] what about Paul he'll have to be judged
[1:17:17] with his well if if his group goes in so
[1:17:22] will mine I'm just about done now cuz I
[1:17:26] preached exactly the same word and
[1:17:28] that's it where he baptized in Jesus
[1:17:32] name
[1:17:32] I did too and millions screamed out all
[1:17:36] at once said we're resting on that I'd
[1:17:45] like to say I'm standing here tonight
[1:17:48] and being mortal once I want to preach
[1:17:52] as long as God gives me strength and let
[1:17:58] me just bring a couple of thoughts
[1:17:59] together to finish this I don't want to
[1:18:01] do it haphazardly I don't want to come
[1:18:06] to church just for the thing to do
[1:18:08] what's a good thing to be thought of I
[1:18:10] want to give my whole heart
[1:18:20] my whole heart I want to give everything
[1:18:25] that I have houses will come and go
[1:18:36] cars will come and go grass will coming
[1:18:43] though jobs are coming though things of
[1:18:48] life will come and go but this is the
[1:18:51] eternal thing that we're doing tonight
[1:18:54] moms and dad teach their children how
[1:18:56] important this place is how sacred this
[1:19:02] place is at any moment it could be your
[1:19:06] special night your special night
[1:19:27] I'll be gone
[1:19:28] brother Reyes next week because I've got
[1:19:32] unfinished business there but many years
[1:19:36] ago I stepped down like I'm stepping
[1:19:38] right now it was a man walked up and he
[1:19:44] said I've left the Amish community
[1:19:45] you've heard me tell this before I left
[1:19:49] the Amish community and I've lost my
[1:19:54] business I've lost everything my back is
[1:19:58] shot it's gone there's a man my height I
[1:20:07] look right into his eyes you know you
[1:20:14] can tell him man a man is at that spot
[1:20:23] and I'll never forget the statement that
[1:20:25] came out of my lips so what is your
[1:20:29] hobby and he said I have I have a real
[1:20:35] small green house I really enjoy I
[1:20:41] prayed for his back and for his green
[1:20:45] house and now his green house is the
[1:20:51] biggest green house in Ohio not because
[1:20:58] a man had the ability but because of a
[1:21:01] man was standing at the right place at
[1:21:06] the right time when Jesus came can I
[1:21:16] tell you one more story this is where I
[1:21:18] get in trouble sometimes
[1:21:19] I was sitting into Chinese hotel I'm not
[1:21:25] gonna tell you in the name but I sent
[1:21:28] him to Chinese hotel and I was sitting
[1:21:31] in the room of a brother that's very
[1:21:33] precious to us and a brother from Canada
[1:21:38] and a brother from China was doing
[1:21:40] business together and they wasn't
[1:21:42] surviving they wasn't making ends meet
[1:21:44] and this was a last-ditch effort in
[1:21:47] their business and it seemed like
[1:21:49] everything was gone and we would go to a
[1:21:54] meeting and we'd been in two weeks of
[1:21:56] meetings and now we've come to the end
[1:21:58] and I'm sitting there just totally toast
[1:22:01] and I'm actually sitting on a window
[1:22:04] well Thomas you and I we cleaned
[1:22:09] chimneys together and I would always
[1:22:11] enjoyed sitting on the hearth of a
[1:22:13] chimney I talked to the customers maybe
[1:22:15] preach to them maybe we talked about
[1:22:17] life and I just find a place to sit down
[1:22:21] I've never had the ability to said
[1:22:23] Indian style on the floor but I'm close
[1:22:26] whether I'm standing or sitting so and I
[1:22:30] was just sitting on that window well and
[1:22:32] I'm just sitting there and and they're
[1:22:35] just busy in the room and about 30
[1:22:38] people had been in the room only just
[1:22:40] only moments before and they preached in
[1:22:42] the room because we preach in service we
[1:22:44] preach in rooms and and the brother was
[1:22:49] just standing there
[1:22:51] God spoke to me said bless his business
[1:22:56] and I stood in a little circle about
[1:23:00] this size and they said God just spoke
[1:23:04] to me that he's going to bless your
[1:23:05] business and I took both of their hands
[1:23:08] and I held their hands I just got a
[1:23:11] request only a couple of weeks ago pray
[1:23:13] for them they've got so much business
[1:23:15] they don't know what to do with
[1:23:30] in both of these cases I'm not talking
[1:23:33] about pennies I'm talking about mega
[1:23:38] dollars God owns the cattle on a
[1:23:42] Thousand Hills money don't mean nothing
[1:23:46] to are you with me homes don't mean
[1:23:50] anything to God but he said he bless you
[1:23:52] but I want to tell you you put God first
[1:23:55] in your life and if we're mortal once
[1:24:00] let's put God first in our lives in
[1:24:05] everything
[1:24:07] [Applause]
[1:24:20] god bless you God bless you God bless
[1:24:27] you I apologize for not feeling so well
[1:24:40] but I want to give my best whether I
[1:24:42] feel well or don't feel well
[1:24:59] and went to Switzerland this year and I
[1:25:03] preached a sermon on I have no regrets
[1:25:09] no regrets because I've used this policy
[1:25:16] in my life every day I want to serve Him
[1:25:19] with everything that's within me every
[1:25:23] day is not a church today but it's a day
[1:25:25] that I can pray it's a day that I can
[1:25:30] study it's a day that I can get along
[1:25:31] with God no every day is not a 100 board
[1:25:37] 100% or stays pressed and I think we
[1:25:42] need days of rest at times but even in
[1:25:46] those days of rest do the right thing
[1:25:59] there's a song says I'd rather have
[1:26:01] Jesus do we have the words for that song
[1:26:18] you've been asking for me to sing a song
[1:26:23] okay
[1:26:26] [Music]
[1:27:28] I'm a plan
[1:27:33] [Music]
[1:27:44] [Music]
[1:28:04] [Applause]
[1:28:11] that was Sigma testimony

[1:30:21] I've had a quarter for every time I've
[1:30:23] been told this
[1:30:25] [Music]
[1:30:30] walked into the total stranger in the
[1:30:32] other day of church he'd never been in
[1:30:35] that church before he just looked over
[1:30:38] at me with his go out and shook my head
[1:30:41] and he said I don't know if you've ever
[1:30:43] been told this
[1:30:45] [Music]
[1:30:56] but if you read Teddy Roosevelt story
[1:30:59] his wife died six hours later his mom
[1:31:05] died
[1:31:06] and he made a big X on the diary that
[1:31:10] day and he said today the light died in
[1:31:14] my world
[1:31:15] they took down all the pictures of his
[1:31:18] wife all the pictures of his mother
[1:31:21] forbade his children to ever call her
[1:31:23] name again cause he didn't notice
[1:31:28] [Music]
[1:31:37] you see this is only the beginning
[1:31:41] [Music]

[1:32:02] pictures and our Lord Jesus images I
[1:32:07] said it's good to know who William
[1:32:09] Branham was but it was even more
[1:32:11] important to know the God it's important
[1:32:25] to know me but it's really important to
[1:32:27] know the God that lives inside of me
[1:32:30] [Music]
[1:32:33] that's the important part tonight it's
[1:32:38] important to come to this service but
[1:32:41] the most important thing you can have is
[1:32:43] to know him
[1:32:44] [Music]
[1:32:48] other on this is a syphilis sermon I've
[1:32:50] ever heard what did you do with the last

[1:33:05] done with your life what would you do
[1:33:12] with the next 24 hours I know many of us
[1:33:16] don't have very big big plans but
