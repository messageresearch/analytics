[0:00] they don't really know what what goes
[0:02] with it
[0:03] the the way up is that they're always
[0:06] if you want power see how humble you can
[0:09] get
[0:10] just get away from all your worldly
[0:13] thinking
[0:13] and humble yourself before god and then
[0:15] you've got more power
[0:17] than the man that runs all over the
[0:18] building and makes a big lot of noise
[0:21] because you have been able to conquer
[0:24] yourself
[0:24] and commit yourself to christ to humble
[0:28] yourself
[0:28] before you that's really a power
[0:31] you show me a church that's humble real
[0:34] humble
[0:35] not a uh irrigation a church just a
[0:39] sweet
[0:39] humble church i'll show you a church
[0:41] that has the favor and power of god amen
[0:44] that's the thing it takes humility
[0:47] humbling ourselves before god
[0:49] letting god just work to us don't have
[0:52] to make a lot of noise
[0:55] sometimes as the farmer said he went out
[0:57] to the field with his wagon
[0:59] and every time he hit a bump it just
[1:01] rattled and went on
[1:02] but when he come back he hit the same
[1:04] bump make no noise at all because it's
[1:05] loaded with good things
[1:07] so i think that's about right that we
[1:10] get
[1:10] filled up with the good things of god
[1:13] that the fruit of the spirit might be
[1:15] known
[1:15] through us as he revered so much the
[1:17] first corinthians 13 there
[1:19] how this lord give my body be burned and
[1:21] have all these things and have not
[1:23] charity
[1:24] it's nothing profits mean nothing we
[1:26] want to do that
[1:27] above all things is our individual souls
[1:31] that we're responsible before god
[1:34] it's it's you going to heaven it isn't
[1:36] whether i go or he goes
[1:37] it's you you first and you've got to
[1:41] look this up and come sweep before the
[1:43] lord
[1:44] and i've always found out that the man
[1:46] that humbles himself is a man that god
[1:52] exhausts

[1:06:25] matthew chapter 12
[1:06:26] 38 then certain of the scribes and other
[1:06:29] pharisees answered saying master
[1:06:31] we would see a sign from thee but he
[1:06:34] answered and said unto them
[1:06:35] an evil and adulterous generation
[1:06:38] seeketh
[1:06:39] after a sign there shall no sign be
[1:06:42] given to it
[1:06:43] but the sign of the prophet jonas for as
[1:06:46] jonas
[1:06:46] was three days and three nights in the
[1:06:48] whale's belly so shall the son of man be
[1:06:51] three days and three nights
[1:06:53] in the heart of the earth the men of
[1:06:55] nineveh shall rise in judgment with this
[1:06:57] generation
[1:06:58] and shall condemn it because they
[1:07:00] repented at the preaching of jonas
[1:07:02] and behold a greater than jonas is here
[1:07:06] the queen of the south shall rise up in
[1:07:08] judgment with this generation
[1:07:10] and shall condemn it for she came from
[1:07:12] the uttermost parts of the earth
[1:07:14] to hear the wisdom of solomon and behold
[1:07:17] a greater than solomon
[1:07:18] is here god bless you may be seated
[1:07:21] tonight
[1:07:22] amen hope you don't mind i take my
[1:07:24] jacket off tonight
[1:07:26] can't work good with a coat on yeah amen
[1:07:29] we just appreciate the lord tonight and
[1:07:30] he's been so good to us
[1:07:32] so real to us tonight we just thank him
[1:07:34] for all that he's done for us
[1:07:35] amen and notice the scripture reading
[1:07:37] tonight and and i won't hold you too
[1:07:38] long
[1:07:39] but i want you to understand scripture
[1:07:40] tonight many folks does not recognize
[1:07:43] when god is moving and doing things and
[1:07:45] so tonight when we begin to read
[1:07:47] scripture here and
[1:07:48] and it talks about as it was in the days
[1:07:50] of of jonas and as it was in the days of
[1:07:53] none of us it was in the days when the
[1:07:54] queen of the south came and so notice
[1:07:56] when we begin to look at these things
[1:07:58] tonight
[1:07:58] many people do not recognize until it's
[1:08:00] too late
[1:08:03] then they recognize god and so as i
[1:08:06] always been reading
[1:08:07] and looking through these things the
[1:08:08] last few days and just thinking
[1:08:10] how great that god is now notice when
[1:08:12] the queen of the south comes she wanted
[1:08:13] to come and hear the wisdom
[1:08:16] the wisdom of solomon she'd heard about
[1:08:19] solomon
[1:08:20] she'd heard listen saying many folks
[1:08:22] have heard about the word of god
[1:08:23] many folks know about god but they don't
[1:08:25] know god so the queen of the south she
[1:08:28] came to see
[1:08:29] solomon she wanted to hear all these
[1:08:31] things now notice she came from a mighty
[1:08:32] long way
[1:08:33] she came through the desert there on a
[1:08:36] camel
[1:08:36] not in an air-conditioned car i mean she
[1:08:39] didn't come and stand a nice motel
[1:08:41] somewhere
[1:08:41] but she came through the desert staying
[1:08:44] in tents and riding on the camel
[1:08:46] because she wanted to hear from the man
[1:08:48] of god for herself
[1:08:49] now if you turn to me to kings just a
[1:08:51] moment first kings chapter 10.
[1:08:54] i just want to read to you about the
[1:08:56] queen real quick
[1:08:57] and i want you to understand tonight
[1:08:59] there was something in her heart
[1:09:01] it was more than just head knowledge
[1:09:04] something was moving in her heart
[1:09:06] she wanted to come and hear about the
[1:09:08] very things
[1:09:09] that god was doing and you know the
[1:09:12] bible says tonight if any man lack
[1:09:14] wisdom let him ask of god
[1:09:16] amen if you want to know something from
[1:09:17] god tonight ask him
[1:09:19] amen you say well the preacher is going
[1:09:21] to give it to me the preacher might
[1:09:22] preach it to you but if god don't reveal
[1:09:24] it to you he's only saying words to you
[1:09:26] tonight
[1:09:26] it takes a revelation of jesus christ in
[1:09:29] this hour to understand this word
[1:09:31] and it's not for the world you say i
[1:09:33] thought it's whosoever will the world
[1:09:34] will not receive what god has done for
[1:09:36] us tonight
[1:09:37] the world's not going to receive this
[1:09:38] message that god gave us tonight
[1:09:40] so notice here what the queen said
[1:09:42] tonight amen in verse 1
[1:09:44] first kings chapter 10 and verse 1 and
[1:09:46] when the queen of sheba heard of the
[1:09:48] fame of solomon concerning the name of
[1:09:50] the lord
[1:09:50] she came to prove him with hard
[1:09:52] questions and she came to jerusalem
[1:09:55] with a very great train with camels that
[1:09:57] bear spices
[1:09:58] very much gold and precious stones and
[1:10:00] when she was come to solomon
[1:10:02] she communed with him of all that was in
[1:10:04] her heart
[1:10:05] now notice what the scripture is saying
[1:10:06] all that was in her heart she came to
[1:10:08] ask him hard questions
[1:10:10] in other words she came she wanted to
[1:10:12] know about his wisdom
[1:10:13] it wasn't enough that she heard it
[1:10:15] wasn't enough that somebody else told
[1:10:17] her
[1:10:17] she wanted to hear for herself and i
[1:10:19] want to say to you tonight if you've not
[1:10:21] had an experience with jesus christ
[1:10:23] you need it for yourself the prophet god
[1:10:25] said every son
[1:10:26] daughter of god tonight must have a back
[1:10:29] side of the desert experience
[1:10:31] amen so she wanted to hear something
[1:10:33] from god so here she come to hear this
[1:10:35] great wisdom and notice
[1:10:36] verse 3 and solomon told her all her
[1:10:39] questions that was not anything
[1:10:41] hid from the king which he told her she
[1:10:44] was questioning him
[1:10:46] and i believe that we have a right to
[1:10:47] question god
[1:10:51] people say oh you're going to question
[1:10:52] god as a christian i believe we can
[1:10:54] question god
[1:10:56] are you listening i hope you understand
[1:10:58] and like we ask god god is this your
[1:11:00] word
[1:11:01] is this truth to us listen when we begin
[1:11:03] to look
[1:11:04] through the message of the hour and look
[1:11:05] at all these things many people you know
[1:11:07] they come along the way and you just
[1:11:09] bear with me a little while here tonight
[1:11:10] as they come and they talk about
[1:11:12] the message they talk about the man of
[1:11:13] god and yet now they were
[1:11:15] going away from the message did you know
[1:11:17] tonight the bible says
[1:11:19] that the devil believed in one god and
[1:11:21] trembled
[1:11:23] one god and my my dad used to say you
[1:11:26] know before he passed off
[1:11:27] he said if he believed in three gods he
[1:11:29] shook all the pieces
[1:11:31] but he believed in one god and trembled
[1:11:33] did you know the devil believes
[1:11:34] in the message of the hour tonight the
[1:11:37] devil knows that brother branham was the
[1:11:39] messenger
[1:11:40] for the seventh her church come on
[1:11:41] saints the devil believes that tonight
[1:11:44] but the world says oh we can't believe
[1:11:45] that and
[1:11:46] even people around the ranks of the
[1:11:48] medicine we can't believe that tonight
[1:11:49] but here come this woman asking hard
[1:11:51] questions and i believe tonight as a
[1:11:53] child of god as his son daughter of god
[1:11:55] tonight
[1:11:56] god i want to know that this is truth
[1:11:58] how many wants truth tonight
[1:12:01] i'm not here to play church i'm not here
[1:12:04] to say you know
[1:12:05] maybe this message is right i believe
[1:12:08] this message is right
[1:12:11] i believe this message tonight is what's
[1:12:12] going to carry us through from earth to
[1:12:14] glory
[1:12:15] amen we realize that god sent a prophet
[1:12:17] at that stage but notice here

[1:13:44] when she knew that jesus said in the
[1:13:46] meat

[1:13:49] alabaster box of ointment
[1:13:51] and stood at his feet behind him weeping
[1:13:53] and began to wash
[1:13:54] his feet with tears
[1:13:57] and he'd wiped him with the hairs of her
[1:13:59] head and kissed his feet
[1:14:02] and anointed them are you listening

[1:14:14] was the only that she bought from where
[1:14:16] she was selling her own body as a
[1:14:18] prostitute

[1:14:21] here come these people in you know
[1:14:24] what we call the foot war splunk if you

[1:14:27] here they were they allowed the lord
[1:14:29] jesus to come through the door
[1:14:30] and never ministered service to him
[1:14:33] they did not anoint him with oil they
[1:14:36] didn't give him a kiss they didn't put a
[1:14:37] robe on him but they allowed him to come
[1:14:39] in and set over in the corner somewhere
[1:14:42] they'll notice all these people around
[1:14:43] the pharisee the prophet god said
[1:14:45] that this pharisee all he wanted to do
[1:14:47] was make a show of jesus christ
[1:14:50] he just wanted to make a show but said
[1:14:52] god had other orders god had other
[1:14:54] things in mind
[1:14:55] he said this little woman standing
[1:14:57] outside the door standing outside the
[1:14:59] fence was watching
[1:15:00] and she began to see that nobody was
[1:15:02] doing service for him
[1:15:03] but something struck her heart only one
[1:15:06] person
[1:15:06] only one woman in that hour recognized
[1:15:09] who jesus was
[1:15:10] only one person so listen saying out of
[1:15:12] all the pharisees that were there
[1:15:14] one woman that was a sinner woman saw
[1:15:16] these things happening
[1:15:18] he said over the lord how could that be
[1:15:19] tonight how did this foot worse flunk
[1:15:21] you ever let jesus get by
[1:15:23] how did he ever let him go by and never
[1:15:25] gave him any kind of service
[1:15:27] how could he do that it was orchestrated
[1:15:29] by god that one woman
[1:15:32] in that day one woman in that age was
[1:15:34] looking for something
[1:15:35] and god saw her heart many of us today
[1:15:38] we were lost in sin
[1:15:39] we was wandering around with no
[1:15:41] direction tonight but god
[1:15:43] called one woman listen the elected lady
[1:15:46] as the bible speaks up tonight here was
[1:15:47] that woman the world says oh she's a
[1:15:49] prostitute
[1:15:50] she's no good she's no count where did
[1:15:52] all we come from tonight
[1:15:53] but here she come looking she saw
[1:15:55] something that the pharisee
[1:15:57] who had a religious spirit couldn't see
[1:16:00] they couldn't see it you know in the age
[1:16:02] we're living in
[1:16:04] amen many people cannot see even
[1:16:05] religious folks can't see
[1:16:07] that jesus is moving amen we just had an
[1:16:10] election i'm not
[1:16:11] political understanding right but we
[1:16:12] just had an election and the prophet god
[1:16:15] had prophesied how this woman would come
[1:16:17] she'd either be president or vice
[1:16:18] president if you read the message
[1:16:21] tonight and follow along
[1:16:22] he said she'll have great power and here
[1:16:24] she stood the bible says in revelation
[1:16:26] 17

[1:16:29] woman stood in purple
[1:16:30] with her little pearls on come on saints
[1:16:32] read the message just plain as day
[1:16:34] but the world can't see that
[1:16:37] but god has an elected lady that is
[1:16:41] seeing all the things that's happening
[1:16:42] in this world
[1:16:44] we're looking through spiritual eyes
[1:16:45] tonight but if you don't have spiritual
[1:16:47] eyes tonight you can't see
[1:16:49] what jesus is doing tonight and the
[1:16:52] world says all that we this is so great
[1:16:53] that we have a woman in authority and
[1:16:55] this is so great but let me tell you

[1:16:58] eyes that we're looking through

[1:23:15] presence of almighty god
[1:23:17] even the disciples did recognize what

[1:23:20] until jesus began to talk to that woman
[1:23:23] by himself

[1:24:06] she began to walk right dry his feet
[1:24:09] with her hair
[1:24:10] she was doing all these things and then
[1:24:13] she's wondering what is he going to say
[1:24:14] to me
[1:24:17] but i got news for you tonight my lord
[1:24:19] jesus
[1:24:21] i'm going to read something to you the
[1:24:22] prophet god said when my lord came on
[1:24:24] the scene he began to call
[1:24:26] the pharisee he began to call him and
[1:24:29] you know now his ear has been perked up
[1:24:32] tell me something lord you're a guest in
[1:24:35] my house
[1:24:37] you know you're a guest about tell me
[1:24:38] something good
[1:24:40] he didn't know what the lord was getting
[1:24:43] ready to tell him or he had kept his
[1:24:44] mouth shut
[1:24:46] but tell me something good lord just
[1:24:48] just tell me something you know why
[1:24:49] here i said you know i invited you in my
[1:24:51] house and the prophet god said he only
[1:24:53] wanted to make a show
[1:24:55] but he said there was a little
[1:24:56] prostitute out on the street he said all
[1:24:58] them listen close all them religionists
[1:25:00] there
[1:25:01] he said the whole company did not
[1:25:03] recognize him and a little woman of ill
[1:25:05] fame she looked in through perhaps a
[1:25:07] gate
[1:25:07] and she seen him sitting like a
[1:25:09] wallflower
[1:25:10] he said that's the way he is today
[1:25:12] amongst a bunch of religions too
[1:25:14] a wallflower unwelcome unwanted filthy
[1:25:17] dirty holy roller they call it
[1:25:19] some kind of a person that isn't in
[1:25:21] their right mind a fortune teller mental
[1:25:23] telepathy or some kind of an evil name
[1:25:25] he said in jesus listen i'll get to that
[1:25:27] he said but jesus began to speak a word
[1:25:30] against the son of man he said anywhere
[1:25:32] that they speak against the son of man
[1:25:34] it shall be forgiven
[1:25:37] are you listening tonight but when the
[1:25:39] holy ghost comes
[1:25:41] to do the same thing one word will never
[1:25:43] be forgiving you
[1:25:46] you seen the bro lord he said but there
[1:25:49] that little woman
[1:25:50] seen he needed service
[1:25:54] how many want to work for the lord how
[1:25:57] many look for an opportunity to do
[1:25:58] something for the lord
[1:26:01] you know some people think you know it's
[1:26:02] just well it's us for no more but
[1:26:05] god wants you to do something for
[1:26:06] somebody
[1:26:09] it may be a smile
[1:26:12] it may be a kind word you know people
[1:26:15] say when you get ready to do something
[1:26:16] oh how much money are you going people
[1:26:18] look at it wrong
[1:26:19] sometimes just a smile from somebody
[1:26:22] will help them
[1:26:23] just a kind word and sometimes you just
[1:26:25] need to stop sometimes say you know
[1:26:27] god bless you today how you doing today
[1:26:28] and sometimes that's all they need
[1:26:31] but notice here the prophet god said
[1:26:32] that little woman she
[1:26:34] seen he needed service and she rushed in
[1:26:38] real quickly went and got
[1:26:39] an alabaster box full of oil probably
[1:26:42] had brought it with the money from her
[1:26:43] prostitution as i just said earlier
[1:26:45] he said she might have thought he is a
[1:26:47] prophet
[1:26:48] but i remember another woman in my mix
[1:26:51] here he said
[1:26:52] or in the fix another character he said
[1:26:54] that had the opportunity and she
[1:26:56] recognized him
[1:26:57] but here she come she heard about god
[1:27:00] she knew about god
[1:27:01] but she never met god
[1:27:05] that's just tonight but now she came and
[1:27:08] she's got the opportunity
[1:27:09] to kneel at his feet
[1:27:13] it's not enough saints to go to church
[1:27:17] it's not enough to read your bible it's

[1:34:56] recognize his very presence
[1:34:59] when paul give me just a few more
[1:35:00] minutes when paul was on his road to
[1:35:02] damascus
[1:35:03] he went when paul was going down to
[1:35:04] damascus i mean he had already stood
[1:35:06] there beside us stephen as they killed
[1:35:08] stephen
[1:35:09] so something happened in his heart while
[1:35:11] he watched him kill stephen
[1:35:14] something that happened to him and now
[1:35:16] on his way to damascus
[1:35:18] he'd been you know getting orders from
[1:35:21] the high priest
[1:35:22] i'm going down and i'm going to take
[1:35:24] care of these chris he was a religious
[1:35:26] leader
[1:35:28] are you listening tonight religion don't
[1:35:31] save you
[1:35:32] religion is only a covering you can put
[1:35:36] on a robe and you can take it off
[1:35:37] but you can't put salvation on and take
[1:35:39] it off salvation is on the inside
[1:35:42] and so here pete paul was on his way and
[1:35:45] on his way to damascus a light shine
[1:35:47] from heaven
[1:35:51] now if you read scripture tonight it
[1:35:53] blinded paul was the only one that
[1:35:55] blinded
[1:35:57] the others heard a voice but they saw no
[1:35:59] man
[1:36:00] read your bible tonight you read it over
[1:36:01] next chapter 9. but here was paul now
[1:36:05] and he spoke blind and he said begin to
[1:36:08] talk to the lord now
[1:36:09] how did paul know it was the lord
[1:36:14] he'd been taught by the great gamiel
[1:36:16] very smart
[1:36:17] he was a theologian god saves
[1:36:20] theologians too
[1:36:24] paul was a theologian and the light
[1:36:27] shined from heaven
[1:36:28] he recognized it was none other than god
[1:36:30] himself
[1:36:31] speaking to him he recognized it was god
[1:36:34] coming down to him
[1:36:36] and he began to talk to god and notice
[1:36:37] what the lord does
[1:36:39] only one man saw the light or was
[1:36:41] blinded by the light just one
[1:36:44] and the lord tells him to go down to one
[1:36:46] man's house named ananias and then and i
[1:36:48] said don't bring that man here
[1:36:50] lord i don't want him in my house read
[1:36:52] your scripture tonight i don't want him
[1:36:54] down here he's killed some of our loved
[1:36:56] ones and you know he stoned them and he
[1:36:58] he's doing all these things to
[1:36:59] christians and jesus said but he's one
[1:37:01] of us
[1:37:03] how about us tonight we look at people
[1:37:05] sometime and we judge them
[1:37:07] but god knows the intents of the heart
[1:37:09] tonight
[1:37:10] every one of us come sinful way come on
[1:37:12] say we were born in sin shaped an
[1:37:14] iniquity come this world speaking life
[1:37:16] and god had to bring us out of the world
[1:37:18] tonight you say no bro lord so notice
[1:37:21] tonight if we're not careful we'll begin
[1:37:22] to look at people oh he can't be saved
[1:37:24] and he can't be saved and she can't be
[1:37:26] saved but god said they're one of mine
[1:37:29] the bible says all the father's given me
[1:37:31] and i'll in no wise lose none
[1:37:34] now understand tonight when we look at
[1:37:36] scripture tonight and we look at the
[1:37:37] word of god tonight
[1:37:39] god is doing something in this hour the
[1:37:42] world doesn't recognize what's going on
[1:37:44] and we step back and we're seeing all
[1:37:46] the things fulfill right before our eyes
[1:37:47] and we wonder
[1:37:48] how long do we have lord well i do i
[1:37:52] don't know about y'all
[1:37:53] how much longer is it lord no man knows
[1:37:56] the day and or the hour
[1:37:57] but god knows when he's coming tonight
[1:37:59] saints but what he's doing he's given us
[1:38:01] everything and and we have in the word
[1:38:03] of god tonight the bible says
[1:38:05] that we have everything we have need of
[1:38:07] to make it in a rapture
[1:38:10] you were to be shouting and rejoicing
[1:38:12] tonight that god chose you to live in
[1:38:13] the seventh church age
[1:38:15] because i can stand in laodicea and i
[1:38:17] can look all the way back
[1:38:19] amen to ephesus but listen i'm not in
[1:38:21] laodicea
[1:38:22] i'm only walking through laodicea i'm
[1:38:24] not in this world i'm only walking
[1:38:26] through this world
[1:38:28] amen but in this bright age i want to
[1:38:30] tell you tonight say
[1:38:31] that god is looking down and our
[1:38:33] spiritual eyes can look all the way back
[1:38:35] and apostle paul being that first
[1:38:37] messenger god let him lay the foundation
[1:38:39] for all the other messengers
[1:38:41] amen and when our prophet come on the
[1:38:43] scene on then in revelation chapter 3
[1:38:46] we begin to see there how that he begin
[1:38:48] to preach this word
[1:38:49] to the end time now notice when jesus
[1:38:52] came
[1:38:53] amen the presence of god unrecognized
[1:38:55] when jesus came
[1:38:57] he came on the scene and they rejected
[1:38:59] him
[1:39:00] not because of his looks not because of
[1:39:03] maybe the way he walked
[1:39:05] but because of the word that he brought
[1:39:09] are you listening it was the word you
[1:39:11] said number one lord so when
[1:39:13] our prophet came on the scene in this
[1:39:15] last church age the same thing began to
[1:39:17] happen
[1:39:18] they followed him remember there was
[1:39:19] three pulls brother ron they followed
[1:39:22] him
[1:39:22] put that sign in the hand
[1:39:27] multitudes of people followed him
[1:39:31] they followed him when he discerned the
[1:39:32] thoughts of the heart
[1:39:35] but when he come to that third pool and
[1:39:38] it come the revealing of the word of god
[1:39:39] what happened
[1:39:41] they turned their backs and they walked
[1:39:43] away from the man of god
[1:39:45] they did the prophet of god in our day
[1:39:47] just like they did jesus
[1:39:49] he even turned to the twelve and said
[1:39:50] won't you go also
[1:39:52] come on say god knows who's he is
[1:39:54] tonight and who ain't god's looking down
[1:39:56] in our lives tonight

[1:43:05] but i believe it was reuben said no
[1:43:06] let's not kill him don't let his blood
[1:43:08] be on our hands
[1:43:09] so we're going to take him you know we
[1:43:11] put him in a pit they put him in a pit
[1:43:12] they went back to get him he was gone
[1:43:15] he still got sold into egypt then he
[1:43:18] spent about i think it was around 13
[1:43:19] years
[1:43:20] in prison something like that because he
[1:43:25] was light on by a woman potiphar's wife
[1:43:28] she began to lie on the man of god
[1:43:30] because she wanted him for herself
[1:43:33] and him in the man that he was he ran
[1:43:35] for his life
[1:43:36] spent 13 years in prison something like
[1:43:38] that i want you to know saying while he
[1:43:39] was there he gained favor
[1:43:41] with the guards he gained favor with
[1:43:44] those in jail
[1:43:45] see but if god loved him why would god
[1:43:48] allow him to go through this
[1:43:54] if god loved you that's what the world
[1:43:56] says
[1:43:57] if god loved you why's he letting you go
[1:43:59] through this
[1:44:01] if god loved you why has he allowed you
[1:44:02] to go through certain circumstances of
[1:44:04] life
[1:44:06] you need to turn right back around to
[1:44:08] the devil and tell the devil
[1:44:10] god does love me and this is happening
[1:44:13] for a purpose
[1:44:14] this has happened for a reason it may
[1:44:16] not even be for me it may be for my
[1:44:18] family
[1:44:19] it may be for another lost one somewhere
[1:44:21] but god is allowing these things to come
[1:44:23] on my life
[1:44:23] that others could see christ in me amen
[1:44:26] we know tonight listen brother ron's
[1:44:28] sitting here and he's one of the men i
[1:44:30] know that
[1:44:30] has had more things happen to him than
[1:44:32] the many men i know of
[1:44:35] but he's still standing tonight
[1:44:38] are you listening he's still standing
[1:44:40] tonight
[1:44:41] why god doing something in his life
[1:44:45] sometimes we get sick we have to be in
[1:44:48] the hospital
[1:44:49] and we wonder why is this happening
[1:44:50] because god's allowed it
[1:44:52] maybe we need to talk to somebody else
[1:44:56] even the doctors i'm made to believe are
[1:44:58] amazed
[1:45:00] at what's happening say why bro lord
[1:45:03] because they you know they know about
[1:45:05] god but they don't know god
[1:45:08] but now they're looking at a man you've
[1:45:09] got all these things going on in your
[1:45:10] body
[1:45:12] and your body's changing
[1:45:15] let's go back and look again and let's
[1:45:17] go back and look again
[1:45:18] come on say they're wondering and they
[1:45:20] go back i may believe even after he
[1:45:22] leaves they go back and look at those
[1:45:23] pictures again
[1:45:25] why brother because the doctors are
[1:45:27] finding it hard to believe
[1:45:28] that what is here scientists listen
[1:45:30] they're doing the best they could do
[1:45:32] these doctors are
[1:45:33] they're seeing all these things but they
[1:45:35] don't know the great creator that we
[1:45:36] serve
[1:45:37] they don't know the jesus that we serve
[1:45:39] tonight and so they're looking at their
[1:45:40] charts
[1:45:41] they're looking at all the science and
[1:45:43] they say there's no way this man can
[1:45:44] live
[1:45:45] but god has another plan tonight
[1:45:49] when lazarus was four dead four days in
[1:45:51] the ground
[1:45:52] the world said he's done the world said
[1:45:55] he's finished but god said i still got
[1:45:57] to work for him to do
[1:45:59] amen i got new skin tonight when the
[1:46:01] world says you can and no way make it
[1:46:03] tonight

[1:51:44] been short-haul
[1:51:46] don't get a wrong example

[1:51:53] wanted to drive a truck
[1:51:55] and he had all these credentials all
[1:51:56] these papers so i gave him a road test
[1:52:00] he was terrible so we got back to my
[1:52:04] yard i said you know

[1:52:36] heart

[1:53:18] somewhere to pick up a loan you came
[1:53:20] back into a dock i've lost freight
[1:53:21] i've lost all this money because you're
[1:53:23] driving the truck for nothing
[1:53:28] if you're not an electrician tonight and
[1:53:30] you go pull that fuse panel off
[1:53:32] and you touch the wrong wires you might

[1:54:10] you see tonight brother ron said in here
[1:54:11] and i'll use this for an example
[1:54:13] none of you have saw actually the cancer
[1:54:16] that was in his body
[1:54:18] you might have saw some x-rays you might
[1:54:21] have saw some pictures
[1:54:23] but because it's on the inside and you
[1:54:25] don't see

[1:54:29] way
[1:54:31] y'all listen to me at night
[1:54:34] you know if we see somebody's got a
[1:54:35] broken arm we're saying god god healed
[1:54:37] it
[1:54:38] but to see a man that's been through
[1:54:41] what brother ron has been through
[1:54:46] i've had people say well you know we
[1:54:50] really don't know if it was that bad or
[1:54:51] not
[1:54:56] who are you we really
[1:54:59] because they're not a believer but a
[1:55:02] real true believer you know what a true
[1:55:04] true believer says we know that he was
[1:55:06] sick
[1:55:07] we know that god touched him we know
[1:55:09] that god did a miracle in his life
[1:55:11] that's what a real believer says but the
[1:55:14] world says
[1:55:15] oh that can't be
[1:55:21] this gospel tonight it's not for
[1:55:24] everyone
[1:55:28] everyone can't swallow it
[1:55:32] this gospel is to the believer of jesus
[1:55:35] christ
[1:55:37] this gospel is to them amen that will
[1:55:40] carry this word
[1:55:41] not just in their hand but in their
[1:55:43] heart
[1:55:45] i know we're living in the age of
[1:55:46] technology and sometimes you know we
[1:55:49] we don't have our bible maybe in our
[1:55:52] possession
[1:55:53] but you know that you've got it on your
[1:55:55] phone now
[1:55:59] i got the message on my phone now i can
[1:56:02] listen
[1:56:05] i listen people don't even know i'm
[1:56:06] listening because they got a hearing aid
[1:56:10] and it comes through my phone to my
[1:56:12] hearing aid and so i can be talking to
[1:56:14] somebody and listen at the message out

[1:56:27] listening at a message i said yeah
[1:56:31] think about it saints so we have all
[1:56:34] these things at our fingertips
[1:56:38] but it's up to you what you do with it
[1:56:40] now this phone can be used for good and
[1:56:42] bad
[1:56:45] you got the holy ghost tonight it'll be
[1:56:47] used for good
[1:56:49] but if you don't have the holy ghost
[1:56:50] tonight you go to websites
[1:56:53] you go to places you've got no business
[1:56:56] and then you'll begin to feel guilty
[1:56:57] because you know you're doing wrong come
[1:56:59] on saints
[1:57:00] but it can be used for good tonight just
[1:57:01] like this word the devil uses the same
[1:57:03] bible that we preach out of
[1:57:05] the same bible that we talk about the
[1:57:07] devil we use the very same scriptures
[1:57:09] and just change one word
[1:57:10] like he did with eve
[1:57:13] just one word you must have
[1:57:16] the baptism of the holy ghost in order
[1:57:19] to withstand the devil in this hour
[1:57:21] and if you don't have the holy ghost
[1:57:22] tonight i want to say to you it's more
[1:57:24] important than anything you can do in
[1:57:26] your life
[1:57:27] it's more important than another job
[1:57:29] it's more important than a greater
[1:57:31] position on your job
[1:57:32] it's more important than anything in
[1:57:34] this life you must receive the baptism
[1:57:36] of the holy ghost musicians come back if
