what an honor it is to be in the house of the Lord this weekend well we're here we're here we have made it we have prayed much about these meetings and we are here and we are so thankful how that we realize that God has set up this moment in time and we realize that the Lord has allowed us to be a part of this eternal moment in time and we just want to appreciate all of our brothers and sisters the the efforts to be here I know brother mcclard's family is here and we just want to say God richly bless you and think a whole lot of your son so he he's he's quite he's quite a uh a great addition here at Full Gospel Lighthouse there's a lot we could say there brother but we just won't say it at this moment so we just we certainly appreciate you being here with us this weekend and anybody anybody that knows knows so but we are so thankful and honored to have the whole entire Ray family here with us and uh we just want to just say God bless you all for being here brother Tom and brother Michael we have we have prayed much about these meetings and uh may we just say it like this that our expectation is at Max Capacity we are such under an an an anticipation for the Supernatural and I believe that this this weekend is going to be extra special and that word just kept coming to my heart about this weekend in particular and I I look that up and it it means a distinguished by some unusual quality being in some way Superior and I believe that this weekend is going to be just that it will be unusual in quality that our Lord Jesus that's how he does things brother brandham said in thirston for life he said I pray thee most holy God and Father that you will visit us tonight in a most unusual way we are not those people who have to have Miracles we do not seek after Miracles are signed but it's because that the word must be fulfilled it is WR written in the Bible that Jesus did those things that the word might be fulfilled the Gentile generation is receiving its last call the world is receiving its last call and we feel God that you're near to move and to manifest your love in this evening light and we'll pray that you'll do it am that's our prayer tonight is that God would do the supernatural that the evening light will shine in this place in such a specific way I saw brother Joey Terry I believe that the evening light is shining so bright sister brother Joey Terry and sister Faith their their daughter was back there wearing sunglasses at the evening light is that it's that powerful you know Satan has fought us on all angles in this meeting to be here and we have arrived in such a time as this and I I I don't believe in giving up and I don't believe in giving an inch but I believe that we are in a spot where we're going to have the unusual and we're going to have the special right here amongst us I believe that it's a time where sons are going to manifest themselves that the unus usual will be shown right here amongst us and and I believe that if we come expecting the unusual that we can have an unusual Upper Room experience that we could we could realize that sons of God can walk out in bravery just like they did 2,000 years ago and they can turn down the devil's achievements and his advancements and I believe that if you come under that kind of an anticipation that young people can receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I believe that that healings will take place I believe Al Capia will leave people right here in the midst of the house of the Lord Jesus Christ I believe that cancer will leave and I I believe that young people can receive a supernatural unusual experience by the by a birth and I believe that we're going to rise up and turn down the devil's lies and I know it's a paradox but it's true it's true that we can believe these things it's true that we can have these things and I I just want you to know that right here right now that the miracle that you're needing is in the room and I'll just I'll just put it this literal just now brother Michael and brother Tom have come with that kind of miraculous Ministry to produce the uh the everliving God right here before us brother Michael holds a very special spot in my heart brother Tom a a great part in my heart these men of God to the Spencer family and to Full Gospel Lighthouse we are indebted to the ray family in their Ministries and we have seen how the Lord has raised up our brother Michael and used him in a very unusual way and God has given him a Ministry to to bless the kingdom of God in this time and I'll just be honest he's more than a friend to me he's one of my best friends here on this Earth and God has molded our connection together in such a way that I I believe that God's going to do something very special here tonight are you under that kind of anticipation and expectation I know there's Brothers and sisters that can't be here tonight but I I just want to ask that God would give them compensation for our brother baton and brother Delaney that are in the hospital that would so be here they wouldn't miss these services but Satan has threw up a blockade but I believe our God is not going to allow Satan to block the visitation that he has for every single one of us so as brother Michael prepares to come I want you to I want you to put on your spiritual helmets and I want you to pull on the gift of God and I I believe that God's going to do the special right here tonight amongst us would you stand with us this evening maybe the Kia beat sister cassing you call the sun to rise and you lay it down to [Laughter] rest and you hold the is all oh M you hold my bre such in awesome God who's so mighty who's so [Music] holy so wonderful who such an awesome God who so selfless who so generous so faithful you are who seing in man [Music] justy oh raining in whole Holiness the table we set for me for you are the Liv ging bre well such an awesome God who so mighty who so holy so [Music] wonderful who such an awesome God who so selfless who so [Music] generous hide him right there where you want oh Jesus the son of God you hung on a a cross to die oh but not even death [Music] he could hold you down for you Rose to life with such an aome God so [Music] mighty a so generous [Music] so faithful you are Hallelujah isn't he faithful tonight why don't we just worship him a little while Lord as we settle Lord in from the worship of your people Lord how it's lifted up Lord to your as a sweet swelling smelling Savor Lord into your throne room tonight Lord just listening from the back study Lord as the worship Lord was sung out from the hearts of your people I thought Lord if that can touch a man if if that can reach the heart of a man and my heart would just swell and Lord my love for you would just Lord be spoken out and Lord how much more you when it's directed to you the king of glory so tonight we're asking oh God that you would now Lord just settle Lord amongst us so that you could speak and minister to the individual needs of your people you've ordained this moment for a very specific purpose and so Lord we're just iring that we could step out of the way that Lord you could accomplish that which you've desired to do tonight Lord an appointed moment somebody maybe walked in Lord not knowing but they've walked into the presence of almighty God and they're going to walk out a completely different person Lord they didn't know what could happen in a night like this but when your presence comes Lord The Impossible can happen so that's what we've come Lord here tonight to allow you to move and deal and deliver and loose as you desire tonight in the the name of our Lord Jesus Christ we commit this service amen and amen amen amen God bless you I am so thrilled to be here this is I'm counting 365 days to be here man oh my it's just just an honor of honors a privilege of privileges uh I I just said I wrote down a note I said how does one Express his heart I and then I ended right there dot dot dot I said Lord how do you express what my heart feels for you brother Ron Brother Andrew and the family brother Matthew and the congregation I just we just love you with a love that is comes from him only the world doesn't understand it they have no comprehension of it but we do because it's his love that's being projected to each other and we're just so so blessed to be be able to be here I don't I don't want to take too much time I have I have a little bit of hay on the fork and uh so we're going to try and get through you know this service might feel like a bit of a skipping rock and then we're going to drill like an oil rig okay so I hope I can get into one section or the other but we'll just we'll just Rejoice tonight around the world Amen now why we came here that's why we came here amen it's for these moments right here and we're just going to allow him to have his have his way and I just I just can't thank you enough brother Ron Brother Andrew for everything you've done over the last few days it's just been incredible so much planning sister Katie much planning Lord doesn't miss anything amen and we just pray tonight the Lord meet you so why don't you turn your Bibles tonight to Psalm 77 while you're doing that I'm going to just read a little quote but AB Bram says now if God up there said by his stripes you were healed the Holy Ghost entwines brings that down by the power of God your heart is set on that it says yes by his stripes we we are healed God you said it in mark 11:24 whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe you receive it Lord Brother Bram says we prayed for a meeting who prayed for a meeting he says we fasted for a meeting we've been crying for a meeting yes Lord I believe the meetings on the road then stand stand there like till the power of God comes down and when it hits it says yes he says next man says yes look at it it got double power yes Triple Power yes four times power yes first thing you know it becomes thousands powers of yes he says then the holy spirit moves in and confirms the word of God with signs and wonders following that's it that's what we need expectation I said tonight Lord may it be thousands power yes tonight as the word comes and Strikes your soul you say yes Lord that's for me you watch what God can do when you agree with the word and he'll come and meet your need tonight amen amen a thousand power yes tonight in the building amen and then the holy spirit moves in Psalm 77 verse two in the day of my trouble I sought the Lord my sore ran in the night and ceased not and my soul refused to be comforted I remembered God and was troubled I complained and my spirit was overwhelmed CA thou holdest mine eyes waking I am so troubl that I cannot speak I've considered the days of old the years of ancient times I call to remembrance my song of the night I commune with my own heart and my spirit made diligent search will the Lord cast off forever and will he be favorable no more is his Mercy clean Gone Forever does his promise fail forever more hath God forgotten to be gracious hath he in Anger shut up his Tender Mercies CA what a passage of scripture David crying out Lord have you forgotten to be gracious had he shut up his Tender Mercies and I'm going to leave you right there and in Matthew 15:21 you can turn if you can fairly quickly then Jesus went then and departed into the coasts of Ty and siden and behold a woman of Canaan came out of the same coast and Cried unto him saying have mer mercy on me oh Lord thou son of David my daughter is grievously vexed with the devil but he answered her not a word I'm going to stop it right there as well may the Lord have bless his word this evening you may have your seats I'm going to preach a service tonight if I could title it a little bit and if the Lord can just give me liberty I'm going to title it tonight the silence is over Hallelujah the silence is over silence is an awkward time for some because in this world it's a it's a very busy world it's filled with a lot of noise and often silence is a is a word that we that we that has maybe a bit of a negative connotation to it uh we have conspiracies of Silence even somebody in their uh maybe in a relationship with somebody they might give them the silent treatment or maybe we lift the veil of Silence it's a it's a term that sometimes is it's not generally used or or has a good uh feel to it and in our busy noisy world people fear in some cases silence because it's filled with the unknown right you go in a room and and everybody just goes silent it actually gets uncomfortable generally and people then try to fidget they're trying to figure out how do we fill the void of space and because some people don't actually want to be left in silence because what happens is they're left there with their own thoughts and often people's own thoughts they might not want to go down that road they they want to they maybe got some situations and and such that they just want to drown out their their their inner world or their problems and so they keep it busy because in that silent time you get driven to maybe a place where you have to come and confront what really matters and so the world fills our our our our world really with noise but we know that God doesn't generally work work the noise we know of course because we're Bible readers we know that Elijah he didn't God didn't speak through an earthquake he didn't speak through the great fire and the great wind but he spoke in a still Small Voice if we could say in the Silence of it the quietness of it and so the world is geared to really push that out to squelch the ability to hear that sty that silent or that still voice and so God doesn't seem that doesn't work necessarily in the noise of the world and sometimes it seems in the silence that God has rejected you it seems like he's turned to his his his eye aside as we can read the scripture at the beginning in Psalms will the Lord cast off forever or will he be favorable no more and is is his Mercy clean Gone Forever David is crying out in in a Psalm does his promise fail forever more question mark he was in a silent period God it seemed like God had completely gone silent on David's situation and he cried out at God forgotten to be gracious and there he penned the words down and brother bradam says there in in a quote he said it seemed like a black sheet began to unfold coming down as if God had took my prayer and thrw it back in my face my goodness and he says Lord what have I done have I transgressed your laws that I should have this punishment is if it is just reveal it to me I'll repent and he's crying out oh God don't turn your face from me don't throw my prayer back in my face or drop like a sheet in front of me if there's anything I did please please tell me please I want to repent for it surely I want to see your face I need to hear your voice but it seemed like God had turned his face on him and at that moment the tempter came in the tempter he said came to me and there was one time in all my life that I can call was The crucial moment he says my geeman when I was just barely holding on to the bed the devil said there you are it's in that silent moment Satan says all right here's my opportunity I'm just going to step in at this moment and say see there you are is his mercies gone from you are they clean gone look at it has he responded to you has he even talked to you has he even heard your prayer has he even heard what you said he's completely turned his head his ear from you he's gone silent and he's rejected you there brother Brown says was his crucial moment when I was just barely holding to the bed and the devil said there you are that's your reward for trying to to serve him you mean he'll take you that take that young 22-year-old mother and lay her Yonder as a corpse in the morg and take that precious baby and slam your prayer right in your face and then you mean you to to serve him oh you've been through not your situations you mean to go through this trial you mean you had this situation you mean your family member went here they rejected the message here you mean you went through this this sickness there come on and you think you're going to serve God this way he's G to silent on you on brother Bram says I was standing between opinion it had to be decided there and you've been there you've stood between two opinions Satan calling at you saying he's rejected you boy why don't you just turn away and start living the way you should live and on the other side you're saying no no that's not where my heart is I can't agree with that and brother brandham says I was standing there and I put my hand over on that little head and I said the lord gave and the Lord takes away blessed be the name of the Lord what was he doing he went back to the word to draw on relief at this silent Tower the word is your refuge and brother Bren started to draw strength from another that had gone through a silent moment because there was job in silence oh that my grief were thoroughly weighed and my Calamity laid in the balances for now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea therefore my words are swallowed up for the arrows of the almighty are within me the poison wear of drinketh up my spirit the Terrors of God do set themselves in Array against me oh that I might have my request he says that God would grant me the one thing I long for even that it would please God to destroy me that he would lose his hand and cut me off job had been in silence job had no forewarning no preparation he had no leadup into the situation he God didn't be like job I need you for a moment I need to use you an example I need you to to raise you up and place you in scripture because there's going to be hundreds and thousands of my people of my sons and daughters that are going to draw from your situation I need you to stand strong job I need you to realize I'm going to take you through a difficult hour but you need to know that I'm with you he didn't do that he didn't do that he just job just had to walk and suddenly Calamity after Calamity after Calamity after Calamity Job saying what's going on my my oxen and my camels and this and that no forewarning and he went through silence it was so with job job was the best in the land best man God could find and yet look what happened to him he wasn't chastising him God wasn't trying him he wasn't he was proving to Satan he had somebody that would believe him in the face of difficult God needs somebody that can believe on him in the face of difficult so that somebody beside you can say if he went went through it if he went through it if she went through it in the face of all difficulty when God was silent I can still trust in him cuz somebody God needs you when your hour of needs someone's going to look at him and say if he went through such an hour and he can pull from scripture and say I know in who I have believed in and I'm persuaded spafford went through it those that know Rao spafford who wrote the song it as well where his daughters perished his son earlier properties were destroyed and he came to the ocean there's no voice telling on Artio I need you to go through this because I need you to be inspired because you're going to write a song that's going to be sung down Through the Ages when peace like a river a 10 is my way when Sorrows like sea Billows roll whatever my lot thou has taught me to say It is Well it Is Well with My Soul no Horatio didn't get a heads up warning he didn't wasn't pre-old what was going to happen but in the Silence of the hour he could well up and say oh God it Is Well with My Soul and something welled up from job you think what job went through I don't even have time to go into the details of it but you go read your first few chapters of job and realize as the servant was speaking as the servant was speaking as the the servant was speaking instantaneously each situation came as his life started to crumble and go down but through all of that and God didn't speak to him and tell them all and pre-prep him but what happened he said oh that my words were now written oh that they were printed in a book for they were Graven with an iron pen and lad in rock forever for I know that my redeemer liveth what a revelation that was when job through all the turmoil through the silence he could say wait a second devil I know in whom I have believed My Redeemer liveth and I'll see him and shall stand at the latter day and though my skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh I shall see God in its silence look what God was forming in the silence God actually created and formed a vessel to cry out and tend the words oh that my words were written they were job they were written so that every one of us could reach into that inspiration in our silent moments God often Through the Ages has foretold events used His prophets but in the moment as it's manifesting it's a silent event I'll explain this because I'm always amazed and I'll use a vision that brother Brenham had of the green checkered shirt that was told in detail before it transpired and the prophet would go and and and go through the very details and describe it as the events would move forward and all the different aspects of it were clearly outlaid of what was going to transpire he didn't know where but he just was telling what God had showed him and so we know before the hunt the detail the details of the account of the vision were outlaid and the Caribou that would be shot and and there would be some small fellows there and there'd be a measuring tape measuring 42 in and there'd be a green checkered shirt there and there was a grizzly bear and it was shot and all these details were laid out very clearly as they were outlined of what would take place even a certain shirt that was really believed to be in the garbage it wasn't supposed to even exist essentially but their natural events were were were in your mind were going one way but God had a very different thing outlined and planned Blain That was supposed to be uh wasn't even supposed to be there was was then present and and and certain things started to transpire as brother Ed began to come to the place of a hunt and he started to poke wow Blain I thought you weren't supposed to be here but he was oh so he logged that that interesting and so he would he would kind of have brother brandham tell the story actually a couple times to to throughout the journey think one to his dad then to brother Bud Southwick prior to the vision and so there was a looking forward to what God had had outlaid and what was God what was God was going to do and so he's he's there pre prevision I could say but little did he know that he was actually walking in it he didn't real he was poking at the beginning and and and didn't maybe didn't really really realize but if I could say tonight if we could if we could prick our awareness a little bit and realize that maybe could we tonight be walking in something that God has pre-ordained to happen and we didn't have we don't have a prophet to tell you what's going to happen tonight but God had a plan and a purpose baby you're walking with your prevision you're right there the beginnings of it is starting to transpire and you're not aware of it BR brother Ed they're trying to poke and prod I want to tell you tonight we're in the vision hallu we are in the vision brother brandham Cried Out stay in line I'm in that Vision I'm staying in line with the word of the hour I ain't moving left or right I'm not looking this way or that way I'm in the vision and I'm recognizing where I am God give us an awareness that this vision of this bride is in her place staying in line don't just think well I'm just going to church tonight no you're in a vision be aware of where you are that's why this message came to tell you who you are and where you are said well I just have a mundane in life I go to work pack a bag send my kids to school well sister Ruth mended a little shirt and she sat down at a chair somewh wearing a little table and she took out maybe green or white thread and she started to knit a shirt back or sew up a hole you say wow what's that that was actually a critical action to ensure that the vision came to full manifestation well I just I'm just going to sending my kids to school I'm just being a momm or I'm being a daddy no it's a critical action as you live out the revealing of Christ in this hour Hallelujah wasn't it just like a little lady who started to make some little cakes she had a little bit of meal left couple little sticks left and there she was going thinking she was going to die well my son's going to die I'm going to go make my very last meal but she didn't know that a prophet had been told you're going to see a lady she's going to do such and such she's going to make you a meal and she's going thinking I'm going to die my child's going to die I'm at The Bitter End God has been silent to me he hasn't heard my prayer my husband is gone I'm in a wreck of a tragedy my son is now dying of starvation I have one meal left that was her world God had a different world God had a different plan I don't know where your world is I don't know what you've gone through I don't know if you're like that little lady saying I'm at the end of my rope it looks like all's over but God has a different plan he has a different Vision he needs to make sure that it comes to manifestation he's given a word in this to is a Prophet spoke no go down she's got what you need in the unspiritual moments of her life she was actually fulfilling the vision in the Silence of God she was living it out should change our perspective a little bit on what we do on our day-to-day that's right actually what did you do today what did it actually fulfill and it just clicked and inched what God has has for you in store it just one more oh the measuring tape just it went in the bag God's like check green cheered shirt unbeknownst about her head got folded and packed check bla sorry we don't need you on the job anymore you got to go home early early but I want more pay no no we got to get home early God's like you better get home early Jack I need you down there God's orchestrating events unbeknownst to you and I but he's making sure that you reach the end the expected end that he has for you God could have supplied that little W Widow of zarapas all he she needed she he could have just given her a sustenance he could have just said you know what she's prayed and and I could I could you know give her the food that she needs and such and such but he wanted to see what her faith would do God wanted to see he wanted to prove to the devil what job would do and stand there maybe God just saying I need to show the world that you will stand I need to show the world your faith will hold and nobody was shouting as now all the events started to come into place no one shouted out it's happening it's on the vision's begun no one did that I I I I find it interesting that at the beginning brother Ed was kind of prodding a little bit oh Blain is here and he he was kind of telling he was kind of aware and then actually when it starts to happen is aware of [Music] nothing the log God made was there made sure through his centuries of time had rotted in place so that whoever he tripped and fell on the water made sure that the Brook wasn't dry that it was wet so that he would get a wet shirt that would force him to go back to the tent and he's just struggling in in the natural events oh why did I fall and I'm sure he was all upset now he had to detach from the group brother brandom and all the brothers are there and I got to go back to the tent and change my shirt I'm just so frustrated right now I can imagine you're going through something of the same sort I don't know why do I have to do this why did this happen to me I'm just so frustrated what's happening in my but God's I got you in a vision there he goes and out he pulls out a shirt out of his bag that's green sheer and he says come on Ruth why did you pack that shirt I told you to throw it in the garbage right then button on the shirt what is he thinking about he's thinking about getting to the brothers that's all he's caring about I got to get where brother bam is and I get on the hunt and on he goes the green checkered shirt the most iconic aspect I could say maybe of that vision and he puts it on and he's wrapping himself in the vision what are you wrapping yourself with the word of this hour you're wrapping yourself robing yourself with the vision put it on you're going day by day you're sitting in your little hour you're going in prayer you're getting a message book you're going to the word what are you doing wrapping yourself in division Hallelujah it may seem silent but God give us an awareness of where we are in this hour God's ordained your life down to the letter yeah he said brother Michael I've heard that often you know God Don't Make Mistakes Etc I'm just telling you again it's been perfect perfectly ordained even in the mishaps even in the trips into the water unordained trip scripture says in Ephesians that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the water of the word that he might present to it himself a glor glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish who is that I'll identify who's who's speaking of that said well I'm going through such difficulty and I don't know about this and how am I get that Lord get me straight it seems like he hasn't talked to me but God in his word wrote that he would have a bride without blemish without spot without wrinkle he's going to ensure that she's there if he ensured that a vision would come out exactly as he had shown a prophet how much more the Bride of this hour God will ensure every single one will be there what I have such a problem brother Micha God I have this issue oh sorry sorry he said he's dead and it's happening right now and I hope you realize it how well that's not my problem how it happens and it might be in silence you might be in a silent hour but the vision still goes forward and will still manifest exactly because the word said though a host should encamp me encamp against me my heart shall not fear though War should rise against me in this will I be confident for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion what scripture was that for what message was that for rapture so God has already ordained to ensure there will be a people that he will hide in his Pavilion so if he said it he must do it and everything now that was required going back to the vision was already in place even when it wasn't even identified Blaine was not away in North it didn't really matter why or or who or what who why when where how he was there you don't need to be concerned with with how something's going to happen it'll just be there don't worry your brain about it don't build a bridge about it well I don't know how my my loved one's going to get saved I mean I mean time is coming so don't worry about it it'll they'll be there amen that's what don't don't worry about the the the part of it how did the measuring tapable get in the bag I don't know how it got in the bag but it got there it could have been translated from one point A to point B I don't know I don't care it was there amen where the shirt we know it got there somehow amen all those different aspects all happening silently they all happen silently they all transpired in some way to ensure that the mystery would actually become revealed I look at the vision that brother Bram had of the little baby with pneumonia and I'm going to go through this one rather quickly and we know that brother brandham goes through this de this account in quite detail actually and he races home and God shown him a vision about a baby that would be made well and he goes and praise and not everything's in place yet the events are not in order and the situation gets worse and sadness and mourning heaviness of heart the situation was Grim in the moment gloom and sorrow are prevalent everybody had lingered different ones that lingered there through the night you can go through the account and brother Bram speaks about it in experiences and visions of William brandom two different messages and other ones as well but and so they're all waiting there and they lingered and and Grandma comes over and she she says anything better and they say no and it falls crying and sobbing on her older and little did they know though little did they know moments moments the Fulfillment was just a matter of moments away you could just be in a situation and it all looks terrible and heaviness and sorrow and sadness and Gloom is it any better no ma it's it's gotten worse in fact and they start to cry and say oh my but there it was just a little bit further there was something going to happen it seemed that God was silent in the hour but if they just held on a little bit more because God was making sure this had to be in place this had to be in place this has to be there everything has to be in order there was an appointed moment it seemed like silence was going really going to be present for so for oh so long and the parents they looked and it looked like maybe God had gone silent he hasn't heard them he hasn't heard our prayer and even though prayer the prophet didn't make any result in fact it even seemed to get the situation worse butram says and I thought something was wrong why there's one person that wasn't in the house and nothing was in order and they they took the little baby over there it was just choking and brother brownon makes the sounds of Choke and the mother runs over and the father begin to work on it and puff on his nose and they both get to screaming and left the baby and brother Graham started working with it and just as blue as it could be it's little body laying stiff like that the lungs congested and folded up and pushed his little ribs like that what a desperate situation God haven't you heard our prayer you even told a prophet our baby would be well where are you they fought for life of the baby till daylight and daylight began to break they thought the baby would just go any minute any minute they kept asking brother brandham what must we do but Bill they called me what must we do he said I don't know I don't know according to the parents they'd been told but it just looked like everything went silent then the grandma moves into a certain place moves to the DU aold she begins to wipe her glasses Graham sat down ducked his head down the mother of the baby put her hand on the door began weeping but Abraham says just exactly the vision they were living the vision but yet it seems so desperate what a paradox in the most desperate of ours in the most Bleak of situations where the baby's Last Breath it could be over right there but they were actually walking in the vision that had to be fulfilled you can say why do you worry why do you fret just wait a little while why do you fret little bride why do you worry there's one here that's here to give you all the sustenance you need everything you need is right here why worry you're walking in the vision I know but in these Desperate Hours it seems like it go silent and it did for them and the old lady sat down instead of being in tears all together on the glasses it had come from the cold and foged them and brother brandom had thought a certain thing was the cause of the foggy glasses even in his he was trying to interpret what it was it says wait a second it's not the tears it's the foggy weather and he reached over a little briefcase got a little handkerchief out and little satchel and started wiping the glasses and brother Bram snaps his finger there it is it's 42 inches there it is how far away are you from this moment how far away are you from God's ordained plan for your situation there might not be a prophet here that's get to detail a vision like a green checkered shirt or a baby with ponia but that doesn't mean that God can't fulfill his word he doesn't need the vision to fulfill it it happened anyhow but God gave you that so you could realize in my hour in my bleakest silent hour he's still there and you're this far from a moment where he says There It Is could you catch it tonight Lord where am I in the vision I want to walk forget the Weeping maybe my situation looks bleak but maybe there it is when your faith can lat like a little lady who grabed the Hem of a garment there it is your faith has saved you blame bmus oh son of David there it [Applause] is maybe you're just that far away from a complete transformation in your home as you walk out of here and you realize wait a second that service was my there at is moment [Applause] Hallelujah often we get our ideas so trying to figure God out don't try and figure God out don't try and figure him out Saul couldn't wait he couldn't wait the silence say Samuel was killing him where is he he said he'd be here and he couldn't just wait and so then he had to stick his own idea in do his own thing and say well forget it Samu is not here I'm just going to go ahead with how I think it should be watch it watch it things went really bad for Saul when he just couldn't wait in the silence he was killing him it's okay the silence doesn't mean God's rejected you God hasn't rejected you in your silence in the moment when it seems like he's not there it felt that way for for Martha and Mary where is he where is he he's our dearest friend one they were very close to the Lord Mary and Martha and Lazarus it wasn't some distant friendship wasn't some you know well we saw him once or twice they had a close connection and relationship with him you got to realize this situation they had communed with him they had fellowship with him Mary had sat at his feet they had such a love for each other to when they had reached out didn't even respond to them Jesus Lazarus not well please come we could apply the scripture and he answered them not a word and Jesus knew sickness was not unto death he says but for the glory of God that the Son of God might be glorified Lazarus was sick when they called in 4 days now he's in the grave where were you couldn't you have come in my hour of need why now he's in the grave he's dead and gone like nothing can transpire I'm sure there's a lot of thoughts wrestling in their mind and Martha said Lord if you'd been here my brother had not have died if you hadn't been silent on me my situation would be so different now I'm in grief in sorrow I don't even know how our livelihood is going to be sustained so we we're thrown into circumstances beyond our control and Mary comes and says oh Lord if thou Hast been here my brother had not have died she repeats it Jesus said he was glad he wasn't even there so that they might believe think about that he was okay with leaving Mary and Martha to go through the grief of death and we can talk about that but those of us that have gone through that grief God said I'm just letting you go through this he didn't tell them he was silent about it Mary and Martha didn't know this they weren't told if you could I I know I'm GNA leave I'm going to not respond to you but I just need you to hold on a little bit no he didn't do that he doesn't do that to you and I either but he knew you know what he also knew he knew the seed in Mary and Martha would have the right response to the situation so he knows he can put you through a situation because he knows within you you're not going to throw in the face of God and say come on God how come you did this to me forget it I'm done believing anymore no that's that's not the response of a seed the response of a seed Lord if you'd been here my brother he wouldn't have died but still I believe that you are the resurrection and the life and on that day he'll raise up oh God you're the king of Glory you're the mighty conqueror I believe said that's the response that's the response I knew you had I knew that's all the time just come with me roll the stone away amen he was silent no longer God was ready to say all right I'm done with this I've held you in silence all so long but now I'm going to break it now I'm going to come to the tomb and I'm going to honor my voice and I'm going to say Lazarus come for for God is silent for so long and then he breaks [Applause] it he's the breaker of the silence at some point job he said it's enough job it's over I've been silent so long I'm coming down to speak to you how about tonight maybe one of you said Lord you've been silent for so long I want to tell you tonight he's a breaker of the silence at some point the silence is over he said well you know did they they didn't actually realize actually the part they were playing I'll try and go into this a little bit but they lived through a certain situation but in their in the silence the end of it was resurrection that was the end of it so God had to bring had to go through the silent hours to bring Resurrection I'm going to bridge you we're going to go a little further now Revelation 81 on you turn I need you to put your thinking cap on because now we start to drill let's drill job God seems silent Widow of zerath Silent Martha Mary silent but there comes a time I will tell you we do not serve a god of dementia we don't have a god has suffers Alzheimer's disease maybe in this world as humans we're dealing with that over and over much more but not not our God our God doesn't suffer oh sorry I totally forgot about your situation I blanked there that's not your God that's not my God everything is in order he remembers everything but says the ever remembering God remembers every promise of his word if it's in here the ever remembering God remembers every promise God don't forget nothing though it looks like it it might look like he's forgotten but he hasn't he's remembered and he's got an appointed hour when you got to D the shirt and step in the vision he said like he told Moses 400 years that go through up time and Abraham his seed would sojourn in a Strange Land and I've remembered my promise and come down to make good on what I said nobody likes somebody that don't make good on what they said it's like yeah I'm there I'll be there I got your back and they don't show in your clutch moment when you really needed them like I got you you're my best all right and you're like hey where were you man oh man I had this situation that situation this came I'm so sorry that's not God that is not God the problem is sometimes we think it's our moment that we really need him he's like you actually I need to go a little more he knows the moment you need him usually in our hour of need it's usually a few steps further than what we think we need it's like it just gets a little bit worse you're like I'm at my worst moment God's like no it's actually a little bit more and then I'll come job's like I can't handle this no job it's actually all your camels and all your donkeys and all your sheep and your children and your health and it just went right to the end curse God and die God takes you all the way and Joel probably thought after the first messenger I can't even take any more than this the second messenger oh God how do I even handle this the third messenger it's the end and God's said no joob it's not quite but I will be there God don't forget he doesn't forget his curses neither does he forget his blessings God don't forget anything man he don't forget nothing if I I don't have time to go into it but Dan and Ephraim they had they were there and they Ser they served Idols there in the scripture in Deuteronomy 29 and they went and served gods of other nations and God never forgot it because in the scripture he said if you do that your name is going to be blotted from under heaven and generation went on it's like that's that's my great great great grandpappy they did that no God didn't forget because all the way then brother says and here were plumed down to the Millennium age almost and God still remembered that sin he still remembered it he remembered what he said he remembered what they did he says that's the reason friends I believe I've always tried to stay with that word no matter how strange it seems he says well he said well they thought well we got away with it thees Silence of God also doesn't mean you get away with it either you know some people go out like well whatever I'm not I'm going to leave the message and no it's maybe in the back of their mind they're like is the lightning Bol going to come no God hadn't forgotten they go and do certain transgression or they go and serve some other gods or do raise up some other Idol before God like you know well you God probably just you know nothing really happened I'm still living everything's great no everything's not great just because God hasn't said anything or done anything and you're just living as you always have doesn't mean God's forgotten come on doesn't mean he's forgotten cuz God isn't mocked he said he won't forget the curse if he won't forget the curse and he wrote it down there and but BR says all down Plumb down to here God still remembers the sin then I would have to say if you don't forget the curse what about the blessing man let's not worry about the curse side because that don't apply to you and I we're Believers but what about the blessing can a woman forget her suckling child that she should not have comp passion on the son of her womb yay they might forget a Woman Who Bore a child that has a suckling baby might forget him but God you say that's impossible for God to forget that for for my mama to forget that but God said yay they may forget yet I will not forget behold I have Graven thee upon the palm of my hands thy walls are continually before me thy children shall make haste the Destroyers and they that made thee waste shall go forth from thee God remembers His blessings maybe you just need to go through them a little bit maybe you need to remember them God hasn't forgotten them maybe you need to remember them said Lord I just need to rehearse myself with what you already know but I need to remember you are the god that Health all my disease I remember so has he not forgotten Hebrew boys they were waiting till God decided to break the silence think about that moment I I I love the story of the Hebrew boys and there they were because I love what they said there they were before the great situation they said if it be so our God whom we serve is able to Deliver Us From The Burning Fier furnace and he will deliver us out of the hand of a king but if not if God chooses to be silent in our hour of great need that's what they're saying but but if not be it known unto thee that we will not serve thy Gods nor worship the golden image if God turns his back on me and doesn't even see my situation or response still I will serve him think of that moment staring at the Flames of the fiery furnace and they said if you don't serve the gods bow down and serve the idol and if not you're going into a fiery furnace your flesh is going to burn off you alive as you stand there and you're going to melt down into Cinder and Ashes while we watch you if my God so allows that still I will serve him that's powerful you know what though it maybe seemed like God was silent but it was very loud in another place if you could just into the other dimension Gabriel just pulls the sword out Lord there's a real problem down there on Earth can I go down there and deal with it raise the legions come on we got three young boys that are standing for the King of Kings they need help oh God let me get down there heaven was in a roar they're saying we need support we need reinforcements down there God's like wait I know I know what's going on down the wor with come Lord please Gabriel I've got the control of water and I came down in the flood and unleash my Fury let me go down there and he raised the roof of the throne room let me flood that furnace and all the Angels saying yes let wormwood go let him take it over let him wash Babylon off the face of the Earth it was loud it was a roar meanwhile shadra Meo waiting for the decree we will not Bend and but little did they know there was a Roar and then God says wait I know Gabriel I know where I know all you Angels you have capacity but I'm going to step down I'm going to break the silence I'm going to tear into that Kingdom and as they stepped into the fiery furnace whoos Shadrach meach abedo you know what it's words might have been I just came to break the silence I just came to tame the fury heaven was in a roar oh God it seemed like you weren't hearing us no I heard you all the time I had to argue with my angels to let them know I was the one that wanted to come down the silence was in a little argument no wormwood no Gabriel it's me this time maybe in your situation you're like Lord and really up there it's just like Gabriel it's me I'm going down I'm going to speak to them tonight you just hold back cuz God says She's Mine she's my business her needs my business I know you I know I've used you but but I need a personal I need to talk to them I want to step into the fire with them and say it's okay I've heard your prayer and I've come to save you God cares about you the same thing happened with Elisha poor Gesa got his knickers in a knot about what was going on so Elisha we got problems Elisha had been through too much Gaya it's all right you know what was happening though fiery horses were getting hitched up the harnesses of fire were being placed on the fiery horses and chariots you what a clamor that was hey I need the I need all the the horse people up in heaven the angels that took care of them get them hitched up quick quick quick come on we got to get down there Gaz is a little worried so we need to show him that we're still here we've never left he's never left he's still here he believe then he's the same yesterday today and forever so if he came about with Gesa surely he's here tonight the horses of Heaven the legions of God are there around you it seemed like silence but a roar in [Music] heaven think about it brother Bram says about amram he says who hadn't answered a prayer God of History hadn't answered a prayer in 400 years as far as we have record but he made a promise that he would bring them out and seemingly we had a silent God for a long time but the hour has come where he's going to rise on the scene the hour has come When God says I'm here I'm breaking my silence I've sat here watching long enough it's now the moment of my move and he said one night amram had prayed several years his hair was now turning gray and no deliverance and he said God you promised this we've looked forward to it and we see the signs are all here oh if I could put ourselves in this day and hour and what we're seeing around us at the day and age the signs of the times point to a certain hour Rapture season God we waited for this and we see the signs he said it's time for you to do something this was amram's prayer he says while he was in deep concentrated prayer he looked standing in the corner he rubbed his eyes he said and there straining there stood an angel can you imagine that moment when he realized God heard me after 400 years is that an angel is that my answer to prayer maybe you're rubbing your eyes tonight a little bit is that the word for me tonight is that my prayer being answered is that God speaking to me telling me I heard you and I'm breaking the silence tonight I'm going to read a few quotes Revelation 81 said and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour and many people I could say maybe get bogged down maybe they clam up or they may be spiritually shut down somewhere when these these scriptures get read like whoa I don't know where the preacher's going or that's a little deep for me or something like that when it starts to maybe go towards speaking on the seals and specifically the seventh seal but I don't believe that God who is revealed in Simplicity would to make his bride shy back from the greatest revealing of all history there's no way you should step back that's the devil that's trying to shy you away from what he's revealed in this hour people say it's closed or it hasn't been opened and Satan's trying to hinder you by telling you it's closed because he knows that it's what you need to become the bride or I should say recognize you who you are there's no Prophet other Prophet coming there's no more word to be restored there's no more other message to come it's been opened it's been shouted it's here people bring their own ideas convolute things I'm not interested in anyone else's ideas God gave one messenger there's one that fulfilled Malachi 4 there's one that fulfilled Revelation 10:7 to be that vess which a mighty Angel would use the very thought of God to be revealed to you and I we don't need to shy away from it CU it says in scripture I saw another Mighty Angel Christ come down from heaven clothed to the cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet as Pillar of Fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the earth and cried with a loud voice may I just say a loud voice it wasn't quiet it wasn't silent something was changing as when a lion roars and he cried seven Thunders uttered their voices seal up those things keep secret bring to silence that which the seven Thunders uttered and write them not and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and on Earth lifted his hand to heaven SW by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are and the earth and the things that therein are and the Sea and the things which are therein and there should be time no longer but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound if I could say silence will be broken the mystery of God should be finished silence no longer as he hath declared to his servants the prophets Hallelujah now I'll just State a few things the teaching on the Thunders must compare with the word I don't care what people say if it doesn't line up with this it's false but Brown says the way the church ages and seals and all the rest of it when anybody thinks that they have them seven Thunders if it don't compare with the rest of the word there's something wrong no one knew what the Thunders were about until a prophet revealed it the seventh Church age Prophet will be the only one that can make it known in the end time period brother BR says the seven thunders of Jesus came forth was what was in those Thunders no one knows but we need to know and it will take a prophet to get the Revelation because God has no other way of bringing out his scriptural Revelations except by a prophet the word always came by a prophet and a prophet must be Vindicated to match with the word we know that a thunder is a represents God's voice the voice of God the Thunders were revealed in the Seven Seals we're not waiting for a further Revelation brother brandham says in questions and answers he says have they asked have the seven Thunders which equal seven Mysteries already been revealed were they revealed in the Seven Seals but are yet but are yet not known to us as the Thunders yet question mark no they Thunders what he's referring to were revealed in the Seven Seals that's what the Thunders was about they was to reveal the seven Thunders uttered their voice no one could make it out John knew what it was but was to silence it and not forbid and forbid to write it but the seventh angel in the days of his sounding the seven Mysteries of the Thunders would be revealed the Seven Seals opened up what the revelation of the Thunders was now someone he says has been asking me theologians brother brandom if your experienced God gave you for his people you're eligible to write a Bible yourself your word that God your word that God has manifested look at the trickery here he says that might be true see he was trying to catch me but you see I couldn't do that he said why couldn't you you've all the qualifications I said but you look one word can't be added and he said them seven Thunders you see wouldn't them seven Thunders blasting out won't that be a revelation given to some man I said no sir it would be adding something to it or taking something from it it's the seven Thunders are all revealed in there and the Seven Seals opened up the revelation of what that was amen and another the last point the coming of the Lord the lamb taking the book and the Thunders are all connected BR says for some Reon there was some reason God let his seven voices be thundered because it must come we find that Christ the lamb that the book in his hand he opened the seventh seal it's a hidden Mystery or if I could say there's silence there there no one knows it right along with what he said no one would know his coming they also would not know about his seven Thunder mystery so you see it's connected together there's power actually in silence you know one quote said once you've matured you realize silence is more powerful than proving a point I guess you know what the demarcation of mature is now I gu yes if I have to be silenc I don't need to prove a point then I've matured Leonardo da Vinci said nothing strengthens Authority so much as silence and then another quote that many of you probably know it's better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak and remove all doubt so silence is a c tactic actually when you don't want no one to know anything you must maintain ultimate silence because if even one person even your bestest bestest friend even then you're at risk so God said I'm telling nobody my secret I'm sealing it up and so God the master of all strategy employed the tactic of Silence but br says if I'm planning to do something I better know bet I better know better than to tell anybody about it not that that person would tell it but Satan will hear it think about that think about that a moment he says I can I can't get it in my heart there as long as God has got it closed up with the Holy Spirit as he goes Satan can't get it in my heart as long as God has got it closed up with the holy spirit so that's between me and God there's some place there that is so protected even when the devil can't know about it but the moment you actually speak it it's now out there and he knows think about that and he says I've tried he says I tell people I'll do a certain thing and watch the devil cut off every wheel he can to get there see in beat me to it you wonder why you're like well I'm just going to go and do such and such and you're going to go bless somebody and just watch your tire fall off your engine blow out this happens your wife called you come home we got a major situation you're like we just going to bless somebody yeah well you spoke it and he's like mhm throw all hell in his way he's going to beat you to it or at least try but he said if I get the Revelation from God and just don't say nothing about it then it's different amen if I get a revelation from God I I thought Satan doesn't have unfettered access there's a top secret location that God has closed up by the holy spirit that he can send that pipeline to you and I and reveal his word to you and the devil can know nothing about it touch not the oil and the wine Revelation is between you and God and the importance of it brother Bram says as we know the importance of it cannot be underestimated he said the importance of Revelation by the spirit to a True Believer can never be overemphasized we know the quote he says no I'm talk not talking about the Book of Revelation and you but I'm talking all Revelation and to think about it to man it's silent even right here right now something's happening in another dimension and God's got a dedicated pipeline straight to your soul and the devil don't know nothing about it and he's like so what's going down there Elton Virginia and little does he know the pipeline of God God is revealing his word and the devil don't know nothing about it if Satan could have get a hold of it now speaking about God's secret there's one thing he don't know he can't interpret anything he wants to and impersonate any gift he wants again any kind of gift but he can't know this the seventh seal it's not even written in the word it's a total secret he said the Angels everything shut up if they made one move it might give away something and so they just shut up quit harping everything stopped it's butter B and I thought think of it Heaven is a loud place just for warning you when we get there it ain't silent angels that have been created just to cry out holy holy holy is the Lord God Almighty and with their wings they beat and they cover their face and their feet and they stay they fly in the throne room the pillars of Heaven are shaking at their voice it's a loud place but at this moment God says everybody don't even breathe don't move and for 30 minutes nothing move can you imagine because God was so concerned he stopped heaven to ensure his secret was not revealed and now brother brandham now goes and you could listen to the seventh seal and I know who's all read the seventh seal hopefully everybody if you haven't go read it and you know you're probably going to come to the end of it and be like you're waiting for a volcano eruption and you're like and you might wonder I Wai for a big glorious boom Seven Seals been unveiled and you might might have that but it is an un folding and after the seventh seal of the seals have been opened and loosed Now message after message God starts to unveil and he starts to break [Music] silence and he comes through a message he says in the seventh seal he says and now I stand on the platform tonight I have the Revelation that revealed it's a threefold manner so he says this in the seventh seal and if you study this the word he says that I speak I will speak to you by God's help of a fold of it and then you get to the end maybe of the seventh seal and you wonder where's where is it all but you need to now start to go through what God was now revealing in a threefold manner and now where does he go there and so you start to dig a little bit and brother Brandon preaches a very significant message that if you take that little phrase three-fold manner he says it mostly in Christ The Mystery of God revealed he says God has a three-fold purpose in this great mystery secret like I said I'm drilling okay I'm going deep with an oil okay you're going to come with me because there's living water down there where we're going to tap in too so he starts to reveal the purpose of his great mystery secret the secret that only that Jesus never even spoke of God's great mystery of how he said it brother R said it's a secret he kept it a secret that's the reason under the seventh mystery when the seventh sea was open there was silence and Jesus when he was here on Earth they wanted to know he said even the son himself don't know God has all this to himself it's a secret he set heaven for he said silence in heaven for a space of half an hour seven Thunders utter the voices John was even forbidden to write see the coming of the Lord all right so now we've made a link the mystery the secret is connected with his coming okay that's the one thing he hasn't revealed yet of how he will come when he will come he said it's a good thing that he doesn't and then follows it immediately with he has showed or revealed it in every type that's in the Bible so there if you stopped there it's a good thing he hasn't but you need to keep going you need to keep digging because he showed it in every type that's in the Bible therefore the ENT enre Bible is the revelation of God's mystery in Christ it's the expression of one goal he said all the acts of the Believers have been en typ and expressing and now in this last day has revealed and he shows it you say well brother Michael help me I'm going to God goal God's goal has been Redemption all along he's had a a three-fold way so that he could come and redeem God's goal to bring back the Covenant Angel was coming down to take the other part of the Covenant which is you and I amen and so they but here the Saints of old in Scripture that brother Brenham says the entire Bible is an expression and it's revealing Christ I say well how was that well I'll tell you let's just go back to the perfect type in Scripture and we'll go back to Joseph and how many in Scripture that we could go to and we have the details of their life and we could go back here and read them and we can look back in hindsight and there was a mystery tied up in their life okay there's a mystery there there they didn't even know what they were doing and so here Joseph is now he he he starts to have dreams and he sees this dream of of she bowing down and then a sun and a moon and the stars and his brothers bowing down to him and and such and he's he's creating this incredible jealousy and hatred dreamer you little scum you're going to think that we're going to bow down to you what do you think you are you know exalt yourself above our J father our Jacob Our Father what a kind of man they mistreat him and they jealous about him and they they scorn him and they hate him so much they they send him and kick him and throw him into a pit and then they say w hey we got a slave for you we need to get rid of this guy who is he yeah just some scum we don't want around us how much take them for some silver yeah we'll buy we'll take them for some shekels of silver get them off our hands Brothers what are you doing I'm your flesh and blood oh God in the pit I'm sure he cried out hear my prayer right now silence and little did Joseph know that he was actually revealing Christ think about it if I could say this there was a mystery or I could say Christ was the mystery in Joseph being revealed because how Jesus was sold for 30 pieces of silver as Jesus was betrayed by his Brethren as Jesus was hung on a cross as Joseph went through all the different types went into prison and all these different things he was actually revealing Christ that's right that's what his life was doing said well I don't see any Scripture actually where Joseph got even a glimpse and says Joseph you're actually revealing who I am you're revealing my coming Joseph didn't get that I know you got to you got to be sold you got got to go through the ultimate betrayal Joseph because you have to reflect me you have to be a perfect reflection of me can you just do that Joseph no he didn't get that heads up that's right he had to go through it but in the mystery of his life he was revealing Christ silently in a sense God didn't tell him it was in silence that his life was being mysteriously I should say unveiled and so there in God's silence he was revealing a very type of himself you could see it through David as shimi spits on him curses him cast stones on David you bloody man he says Thou man of B this is David David the Lord has returned thee upon the all the blood of the House of Saul and deliver the kingdom into absam and thou are taken in mischief and David Rose up took his sword and said I'm gonna whack your head off you wretched evil man oh sorry that's not in scripture No it's not in scripture actually it says what have I to do with you sons of Zariah and his servant said let me take his head off if you won't no let him curse because the Lord has said unto him curse David read the scripture the Lord hath said unto him curse David who then shall say wherefore hast thou done so why because David had to portray an expression of Christ's coming that's right and had to be the rejected King and in silence you wretched and David bore that in silence as he started to reveal through his life the coming King Abraham did so joanah in the belly of the whale did so you know why Jonah is in the belly of the whale because Jesus had to come out and say for as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly oh God why am I in this the way why did he go through all this because there was one that was coming that was going to be part of his revealing that had to go into a tomb but as the scriptures say his soul would not be there and corrupted and Jesus had to pull from that life of Jonah and say as Jonah was in the whale Jonah was revealing Christ's coming it was a mystery being revealed and they had no idea no idea they just were going through life the UPS the Downs the Heavies the difficults the the the Terrible circumstances but they were revealing how about Ruth and Boaz as as Boaz is compelled to redeem Ruth why Boaz you're you're marrying a moabit a gentile I don't know what I'm compelled to Something's driving me I don't understand it myself but I must take her and Redeemer why because he's revealing a redeemer that had to come and take you and I in the mystery of boaz's life he was revealing Christ Tamar as she there went there and deceive Judah just so that the seed of Judah could Prevail and go through and say Tamar what are you doing I don't know but you can look back like of course Tamar's doing that because scripture must be fulfilled she didn't know that and she bore all that shame ridicule as she revealed the coming King okay all these Old Testament Saints and all the others that I never mentioned were participants in the revealing of Christ and they didn't know it they didn't know it why because it was a secret they had no idea the difficulty The Silence of their life that they went through where seemed God was abandoned them and they were revealing Christ unbeknownst to them that's not easy you can look back hindsight 2020 well you know way to go Abraham you went there and got locked and you P went all the way to Dan he was a warrior he was he wasn't even Warrior but he did that no that that took some guts and there even Copus and their friend as we come and Christ has stepped into flesh and he is not walking and still the disciples said well isn't a li supposed to come they're still missing the moment actually and Copus and their friend they're woefully walking down the road to me and I can tell you there probably some long moments of silence as they walked long faces clus I don't know but and they just go in silence and then one steps up beside them hey why are you so sad why are we so sad where have you been and they start to go over all the situation of their life woeful conversation and they all the situations and this Jesus has come and mighty indeed and he did this and we trusted him to redeem all Israel and they're they're just pouring out their woeful time of all the situations and then don't you certain women came and they astonished us that the seur and there certain of them went with us and found it even so that it was empty I don't know where he is now is whoa my goodness don't you know what's happened and then he said unto them oh fools slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken ought not Christ to have suffered these things and beginning at Moses he expounded unto them all the scriptures concerning himself Hallelujah you know I could say it a different way and God stepped up beside them and started to break the silence and he started to point back to scripture and say see Moses there that was actually typing me see Abraham there it was typing me see David it was typing me see all through the Psalms that was me it was revealing me see Joshua see Isaiah see every single one of men through the scriptures he starts to tell them and he starts to break the seal of who he was what a walk and Copus and his friend are like wow but says it's beginning to soak into them you mean to tell me that that one Jesus of Nazareth that has walked with us is the Messiah you're telling me he's the he's the king of kings they still actually hadn't caught that it was him beside them uhhuh I think God had a little smile on his face he actually probably had to turn his head for a second like get my composure that's exactly what I'm saying Copus and he said he had done and told them that they were fools for not looking at the prophecy of the day to see the fulfilling that this had taken place in the last few days and he said and Vindicated the prophecy it was then that they knew their crucified friend Jesus had fulfilled every word of it this is him this is the Messiah we missed it where is he's gone now and I'm sure there was a flurry of of a conversation between them then The Messengers down in the Tomb this morning were right he is [Applause] alive yes he's alive God just wanted to say it's me but he couldn't he had to wait a little bit longer and he said well I think I must go no no don't you're you're opening the word to us I can't the message I need to grab a hold of it come and stay with me come and have lunch with me we need to hear more of this word they still hadn't quite caught who it was but they recognized something and so there they compel him cuz their hearts are burning he said oh comeing have dinner I tell you the silence was breaking and he comes and sits down and the son of man is now revealing himself and the scripture says he then went and broke bread he did something familiar and Jesus can you imagine Copus he's been here all this time we walked with him all this time yes but I had to do something familiar so you could recognize who I am you know isn't how beautiful that in silence actually God was allowing Copus and his friend to participate in the breaking of the silence he was a allowing them to be participants in the revealing of the secret they didn't know it but they were so then I close with this where are we today you know because even then in the in when Jesus came in flesh he told them don't it's not my time yet don't don't say anything don't say anything about that he he kind of question who are you pilate even asked him who are you who is truth what is truth and Jesus didn't say much because it it actually wasn't the full time for the full mystery of who he was of his coming this to be revealed but in this hour in this hour brother Braham says the Easter the revealed secret of God he says he broke the seal and revealed the secret who he was he said he and now God by his holy spirit broke the seal from around our lives Christ has revealed that he lives in us for now we are quickened in him it's by our natural eye or maybe our natural ear it's in silence that God has Moved Through the Ages but God by Revelation reveals to you and I his Greatest Secret of who he is amen it's a revelation that pipeline between God and you and in this hour Silence has been broken why because God sent a messenger in this day to do something familiar let me just turn my back you with a blue shirt have such and such a Nate have such and such a problem I'll turn my back as he did with Abraham what was he doing he was doing something for mear no brother Bram the son of man Christ himself was doing something familiar so you and I could be like Copus and his friended me like wait a second you mean you're he's here now yes he's here now revealing himself to you and I in this hour he says no longer no longer am I holding back Joseph didn't know what he was doing and living Moses didn't know what he was living living it was a secret I couldn't let it out I couldn't let the enemy know what was happening I had to keep it secret here I had to keep it a mystery there but in the last day in the end time I'm going to break my silence and reveal what my plan was all the time why so that you could realize that you are actually part of his mystery Christ The Mystery of God revealed in you you mean little Michael I'm going about my daily walk and I send my children to school and I come to church and I go through my trial I go through this situation and you're telling me I'm revealing Christ in this hour you're telling me I'm actually breaking the silence yes that's what I'm saying Thank You Lord and and you know it and you know [Applause] it Rahab lived Redemption story and didn't know it you are living Redemption story and know it [Applause] silent through all the ages think about it when God could say now's the hour right my delay it's over what a moment for God because he knew the devil can't do nothing anymore I've deposited my seed and it's now coming to fulfillment and all the all my plans have now moved into action and it wouldn't matter for nothing if the enemy knows because it's impossible to stop the plan of God In Action impossible so that's why now at the end time God says all right I open it up now I'm going to let you all know what I was doing all this time what Joseph was revealing what Moses was revealing what Abraham is revealing what you're revealing you're revealing me I'm my my coming in this hour and the devil can't stop it no more amen that's what the mighty Angel was coming down he's saying I'm descending the Lord himself shall descend with a shout he says I've claimed the book I've redeemed my bride and I'm going to let her know it's me all this time because if she knows who I am Christ then she'll see that she's part of me and recognize who she is which will then give her faith to come home with me it wasn't for Joseph's time it's for your time tell her as he sent a message down to a prophet tell her who she is tell her who I've been all this time he says God letting her know the secrets why because you're his bride and that's who he tells his secrets to you don't tell things to somebody else it's not your bride you have a special Secrets just for her and this hour he's saying I want to tell you a mystery because you're my briide I'm going to reveal who I am and how I'm coming to take you home he's said I want to tell her that was me and Boaz and you're my Ruth I want to tell her that I'm the word and you're my Mary I want to tell her that I'm Isaac and you're my Rebecca I'm salon and you're my Rahab I'm Hosea and you're my Goomer I'm the king of kings and you're my bride but says and he being the groom the bride has come forth because it's part of him and it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all Revelation as any others have spoke of the Bride it can only manifest if he does if it does something different from the groom it isn't the bride because she's flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power that's a mouthful she is him did you catch that I'm closing musicians can come then if she is him let continue then down into the further down the message of his writing of the son he says he is the one who opened those seals he is those seals for the whole word of God is Christ and Christ is the seals that was opened what is the opening of the seals then revealing Christ so then if she is him and he is those seals then revealing Christ does what reveals you that's what this message came to do reveal you in in him so that you then can realize Lord I'm part of you and give you the faith you need to get out of [Applause] here God has broke the silence the silence is over the Secret's out the Secret's out you're going home it's home time it's been silent long enough God chose this hour he chose you to be here in this hour even in your mistakes in your difficulties and your circumstances he brought Jonah around and Jonah was used for his kingdom don't get all worried about your circumstance you're walking in the vision and nothing can stop it nothing can stop it the silence is over why don't you stand with me you know great things happen in silence we all know the sun rises in silence Tides shift in silence Revelation is deposited in silence in the silence in another dimension God is actually revealing his word to his people brother Bram says it's it's not this outside see taste feel smell and hear it's subject to death and will die but the inside part of you down there that person cannot die and that person that New Life Starts from there it's a new birth and it builds another person in the image of the person who you are then he says potentially it's here what is it the word promised before the foundation of the world and around here there this only reflects the negative that will reflect the positive the word he says or the translation of the Bride will be the same thing the word that's in you now catch this the body will materialize around that word and the same thing did by Sarah can you think about this more is happening in another dimension than you realize because the voice of this message that is piercing the Pride it's penetrating her as Abraham went down through the years we're going to have a baby we're going to have a baby and he would preach it and there was Sarah and day by day year by year she would hear him testify and something was happening by the word that he spoke he told me that we're going to have a baby he told me that Sarah you would bear a son he told me and she heard it and heard it and heard it and the word that he spoke did something and she didn't even know it maybe for a period of time her body started to materialize around that word she's like wait a second I'm changing Sarah where'd them wrinkles go you mean they're gone are you using any creams no they don't exist it was the word that Abraham was speaking of what God had said if that could change Sarah's mortal body what about the word in this hour on our lips what will it do it will materialize our body around the word for a change into another dimension you see well I don't know what's happening tonight I'll tell you what just happened tonight your body just did a little change one more step in the right direction cuz maybe it's tomorrow morning just after the service so but Tom has to preach to us that we'll leave [Music] I can't imagine what it did when it took hold of Sarah I can tell you what it was happening it was silent no longer the woe is me I haven't seen anything change yet Abraham nothing's happened to me it's been years and then suddenly he's like hey Sarah you looking younger are you kidding me you mean it's begun it surely has I can tell you Sarah when running around the camp guess what the wrinkles gone oh my goodness I can stretch my back she was silent no longer when she realized what was transpiring and I can tell you there should be no silence when we realize we are the Bride of Jesus [Music] Christ Sarah the baby's coming bride the world word is [Music] here amen I want to sing the song Here Comes the Bride do you know that song All right yes we do I know the song I'll teach
