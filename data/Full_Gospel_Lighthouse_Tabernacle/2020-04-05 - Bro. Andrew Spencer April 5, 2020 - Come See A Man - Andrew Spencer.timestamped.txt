[39:23] like to thank you for every prayer that

[39:29] difficult journey God is our strength
[39:32] and our help we came through quite a bit
[39:37] we've got quite a long way to go I'd
[39:40] like for your continued prayers and God
[39:42] it's assembled an incredible team around
[39:44] us as our family and and give us
[39:47] incredible doctors and we thank God for
[39:50] everything that he's done I realize that
[39:53] I'm not alone in the battle but there's
[39:58] a great band of angels and great
[39:59] generals that are standing around us
[40:01] that are praying for us and I want to
[40:02] thank you for that
[40:03] I said also remember that we as a world
[40:08] are in very difficult times and and we
[40:11] realized that God is here with us and
[40:14] he's got this
[40:16] and he's our great provider we've read
[40:20] the scriptures so many times of Psalms
[40:23] chapter 23 and I just would just would
[40:25] like to share a couple of things with
[40:27] you the scripture says the Lord is my
[40:30] shepherd and I shall not want he made it
[40:33] me to lie down in green pastures and he
[40:35] leadeth me beside the still waters
[40:37] and it restoreth my soul he leadeth me
[40:40] in the paths of righteousness for his
[40:42] name's sake yea though I walk through
[40:44] the valley of the shadow of death I will
[40:47] fear no evil for thou art with me thy
[40:51] rod and thy staff they comfort me
[40:54] thou preparest a table before me in the
[40:58] presence of mine enemies
[41:00] and thou anointest my head with all of
[41:03] my cup runneth over surely goodness and
[41:06] mercy shall follow me all the days of my
[41:09] life and I will dwell in the house of
[41:12] the Lord
[41:13] our prophet would remind us of this all
[41:16] powers in heaven and in earth is given
[41:20] into our hands go and I'll go with you
[41:26] whatever you bind on earth I'll bind in
[41:29] heaven whatever you loose on earth
[41:32] elusive heavenly Joe one time was in
[41:38] quite a fix and much worse than I am and
[41:42] much worse than even us now shutting in
[41:45] our homes all over the world
[41:48] and when God came to Joe we didn't talk
[41:51] to him about having a pity party about
[41:54] how difficult the cancer was or how
[41:57] difficult the situation's was God took
[42:01] him into the heavens and begin to ask
[42:05] him were with huge oak when I laid the
[42:08] foundations of the earth
[42:10] when I created the mountains and the
[42:12] valleys and created all these things you
[42:17] see God had confidence in joke that he
[42:19] would go through the trouble whether we
[42:23] realize it or not worldwide
[42:25] God's got confidence in the bride
[42:27] there's not a better group of people
[42:30] that has been prepped and regretted with
[42:36] a token with the word of God anointed
[42:40] for this hour with a message that has
[42:44] prepared us for not just resurrection
[42:48] faith but for rupturing faith and I'm
[42:52] not just looking for God to heal my body
[42:55] I'm looking for God to change my body in
[42:58] the moment in the twinkling of an eye
[43:01] I'm not just looking to just to go back
[43:04] to the church and we as a symbol
[43:06] ourselves as a private pieces
[43:08] but I'm looking for the coming of the
[43:11] Lord Jesus Christ and we minded with
[43:15] this he is the great provider
[43:17] and being that he's the great provider
[43:20] of eNOS for salt of malice
[43:23] so he's given us every weapon that we
[43:27] need in the arsenal of this world to
[43:31] meet the challenge of the power I truly
[43:34] had some good days and that's a really
[43:37] difficult days days that I never want to
[43:40] have to live through again days that I
[43:43] thought it was done and I ask God please
[43:45] don't let me down like this looking at
[43:50] goals in front of me with an incredible
[43:54] family and I realize how hopeless them
[43:58] and sometimes a hopeless that it is
[44:01] within my own humanity have realized
[44:04] that God has given me something within
[44:07] me his word that could reach that and
[44:12] know that he's given me something that
[44:14] will help me through this trial and it's
[44:17] then that I realized that he has drawn
[44:20] so close to me in this moment I realize
[44:24] that the footsteps of the righteous
[44:26] ordered of the Lord he has force all
[44:30] this time and this plate that it's come
[44:31] on the earth he has allowed things to
[44:39] happen there's nothing on occasion with
[44:42] God neither are there any surprises with
[44:46] God God let's not went into crisis modes
[44:50] like our government said he has prepared
[44:53] us as Christians he has prepared us as
[44:57] believers he has got us in his tenants
[45:01] there's not dangerous terror in crisis
[45:05] they're watching over us they're
[45:06] protecting us sure there comes sickness
[45:10] surely conquering sorrows sure there
[45:14] come find natural matters that we have
[45:16] difficult
[45:17] they will but we must remember Daniel
[45:22] was standing on the outside of a lines
[45:26] then and nobody had ever came out of
[45:30] there you see this is the place where
[45:33] people die net and no doubt God was
[45:37] watching over this God didn't go into
[45:40] crisis the king no doubt loved him and
[45:45] Daniel stepped into that lines in and
[45:48] told him I'll see you in the morning
[45:52] three Hebrew children went into a fiery
[45:56] furnace if there was always the fourth
[45:59] man that said the fun we must realize
[46:03] that whether it's Shadrach Meshach and
[46:06] Abednego or Daniel or Joseph we are
[46:11] fulfilling the Word of God in this day
[46:13] this is our table this is our moment
[46:17] whether we have the strength of the
[46:19] fortitude to get through it it's not up
[46:22] to us
[46:22] it's obtainable so we realize that maybe
[46:27] you can't come to my home you see it was
[46:30] in this home to work two great men of
[46:34] God
[46:34] Peyman pray for me that God would bring
[46:38] me peace in the midst of the storm and
[46:44] as they prayed God supernaturally touch
[46:48] me in peace ended and that peace never
[46:52] left me you see you could be sent great
[46:56] quotes and great scriptures and until he
[47:00] comes he makes all the difference when
[47:03] he puts the foot up on the bow of the
[47:06] boat and says it needs to be steel I've
[47:10] said it before and I'll say it again
[47:13] Jesus is on his way and there's nothing
[47:19] that Satan can do to stop him
[47:25] there's absolutely nothing that he can
[47:27] do to stop
[47:29] hiddenness trying to destroy this body
[47:32] this brought this people but god's got
[47:38] his hands on us i said this the other
[47:41] day and i'll say it again
[47:42] i've been sick before but i make it I've
[47:48] been broke before but I made it I've
[47:52] been brokenhearted before and made it a
[47:57] crowd all not but I made it
[48:01] I've been betrayed but I made it and
[48:06] live on that I made it
[48:09] I've been destitute but a minute I've
[48:12] been rejected but I've made it
[48:17] I read you one more scripture before
[48:23] finish we know that all things work
[48:26] together for the good to them that love
[48:29] God to them who are the called according
[48:32] to his purpose for whom he did foreknow
[48:36] he did also her destin8ion to the image
[48:41] of his son that he might be the
[48:43] firstborn among many brethren moreover
[48:46] whom he did predestinate them he also
[48:48] called in who be called living also
[48:51] justified and whom he justified them he
[48:53] also gortat well shall we then say to
[48:56] these things if God people's who can be
[49:00] of instance he despaired not his own son
[49:03] but delivered him up for us all how
[49:05] shall he not with him freely give us all
[49:08] things who shall lay anything to the
[49:11] charge of God's elect it is God that
[49:14] justified who is he that condemneth it
[49:17] is Christ that died rather than is risen
[49:20] again who is even at the right hand of
[49:22] God making
[49:23] for us and I say at that point bhudev
[49:29] who shall separate us from the love of
[49:35] Christ shall tribulation or distress or
[49:39] persecution or famine or nakedness or
[49:41] peril or sword or plague in despair
[49:44] cancer at this pumping whether it bring
[49:47] our lungs or lymph nodes are all over as
[49:51] it is written for thy sake we are killed
[49:53] all the day long and were accounted as
[49:55] sheep for the slaughter may and all
[49:57] these things were bullying than
[49:59] conquerors through him that loved us for
[50:03] hot lunch Spencer and persuaded that
[50:06] neither death nor life nor Angels nor
[50:12] principalities nor things present things
[50:17] to come
[50:19] height nor depth nor any other creature
[50:22] shall be able to separate us from the
[50:26] love of God which is in Christ Jesus our

[53:05] like never before you know it there's
[53:09] some things that happen and come by your

[53:23] for them and you can see God move on the
[53:25] scene I thank God that he understands

[53:30] everything that we're facing and I'm
[53:32] thinking the Lord for nothing but full
[53:35] victory in this battle dad sent me word

[53:58] Jesus Christ we are showing the devil
[54:00] absolutely no mercy for we are coming
[54:04] after what is rightfully ours in the

[55:00] to go and actually listen listen to a
[55:02] message at home but I've been doing that
[55:04] every every day ever since I became
[55:06] born-again but this is what we do in the
[55:09] midst of a battle we we we put on the
[55:12] armor and we put on the whole armor of
[55:14] God and we know we take the sword of the
[55:16] Spirit and we go against the enemy that
[55:19] has come against us like never before
[55:21] and that's why we should be in prayer

[1:03:35] children as they're listening father
[1:03:37] Lord I pray that you'd speak to them in
[1:03:39] such a way that they would see that this
[1:03:42] same Jesus is alive today
[1:03:44] this same Jesus is wanting to slip into
[1:03:47] the room where they're at and minister
[1:03:49] to them maybe maybe they're in such a
[1:03:51] way that just like Jarius he had a need
[1:03:55] that you come by his way father Lord
[1:03:58] Jesus we know that you are to pass by
[1:04:00] this way you've walked this way before
[1:04:02] maybe we haven't walked this way maybe
[1:04:05] we haven't stepped through these through
[1:04:07] these corridors before but father you've
[1:04:10] down these aisles before you've walked
[1:04:12] in our hallways before you've walked in
[1:04:14] our you've walked in our day-to-day life
[1:04:16] you're already in our future you've
[1:04:18] already passed by the way so you've
[1:04:20] already went before us as the Bible said
[1:04:22] but the Angels shall go before thee to
[1:04:25] prepare the way to keep the in it father
[1:04:27] I pray that you would speak life to each
[1:04:30] and every one of us as the word would go
[1:04:32] forth I pray father that I get myself
[1:04:34] out of the way and you use me today and
[1:04:37] speak to your children in the name of
[1:04:39] the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[1:04:42] John chapter 4 and verse 3 I'd like to
[1:04:46] speak to you on this thought today come
[1:04:49] and see a man this this title is an
[1:04:54] announcement come see a man that God is
[1:04:58] with us
[1:04:59] we know the story very familiar but this
[1:05:02] is how the Lord has led me this week to
[1:05:04] look over these things and I don't
[1:05:07] believe that God would lead me in this
[1:05:09] manner
[1:05:09] if it did not have intentions to speak
[1:05:11] to you so come and see a man verse 3 he
[1:05:17] left Judea and departed again into
[1:05:19] Galilee notice his words and he must
[1:05:23] needs go through Samaria
[1:05:26] then he cometh to a city of Samaria
[1:05:29] which is called Sychar near to the
[1:05:33] parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his
[1:05:35] son Joseph
[1:05:36] now Jacob's Well was there Jesus
[1:05:40] therefore being wearied with his journey
[1:05:42] set us on the well and it was about the
[1:05:45] 6:00 hour and there cometh a woman of
[1:05:48] Samaria to draw water jesus saith unto
[1:05:53] her give me to drink where his disciples
[1:05:57] were going away under the city to buy
[1:05:59] meat then say if the woman help Samaria
[1:06:03] unto Him how is it that thou being a Jew
[1:06:06] askest drink of me with them which am a
[1:06:09] woman of Samaria for the Jews have no
[1:06:13] dealings with the Samaritans and jesus
[1:06:15] answered and said unto her if thou
[1:06:17] knewest the gift of God
[1:06:21] and who it is that saith to thee give me
[1:06:23] the drink that I would have has asked of
[1:06:26] him and he would have given thee living
[1:06:30] water may God bless His Word he may be
[1:06:34] seated there in the presence of the Lord
[1:06:36] who said would like to speak to you on
[1:06:39] this thought on come see a man we look
[1:06:42] back in the times of the Bible that they
[1:06:44] were living in there that man was living
[1:06:47] in the traditions of the law and you
[1:06:49] could see and you could see that they
[1:06:52] were living there and they were trying
[1:06:54] to keep up that law and they were it was
[1:06:56] strictly a tradition for them it was
[1:06:59] strictly it had not be it was no longer
[1:07:01] worship but it was a tradition where man
[1:07:04] had man had lifted themselves up that
[1:07:06] that the high priest and the elders of
[1:07:09] the day were lifted up above all of the
[1:07:12] the surrounding ones and it had become a
[1:07:14] tradition and the traditions of God of
[1:07:17] man had become a stink in God's nostrils
[1:07:20] but here the Word of God had been made
[1:07:23] flesh amongst them the light of the day
[1:07:26] had come and was manifested in front of
[1:07:28] them and all of the scriptures that had
[1:07:31] promised them that there was a coming
[1:07:33] Messiah that was coming was now made
[1:07:35] manifest in front of them the light of
[1:07:37] the day was shining was shining upon the
[1:07:40] word itself and here it was the Word was
[1:07:43] made flesh but because they were so
[1:07:45] stupid in their traditions they missed
[1:07:48] what was going on they missed the light
[1:07:50] and it was what it was it was blinding
[1:07:53] to them you see but it was lighting the
[1:07:55] paths to other that they might see that
[1:07:58] there was a man that had came to turn on
[1:08:01] the light that there was a man that had
[1:08:03] come to to fulfill all of the Scriptures
[1:08:06] now these men they had no ability in
[1:08:09] themselves to be able to keep the law
[1:08:10] and to obey every every jot and tittle
[1:08:13] as it were they had no ability in their
[1:08:16] own self to be able to keep the law but
[1:08:18] here was the one who was the law he was
[1:08:21] the one that you see you see the law was
[1:08:24] to them and put them in the jail house
[1:08:26] but there was no mercy that would set
[1:08:29] them free
[1:08:29] from the jail house
[1:08:31] but here the word of the hour was coming
[1:08:34] upon their lives and shining upon their
[1:08:37] lives and to those that were were that
[1:08:40] received it and saw that light they were
[1:08:42] set free from their bondage of
[1:08:45] traditions and bondage of their sins for
[1:08:47] they realized that this was the one that
[1:08:50] was promised to come the Prophet said
[1:08:53] that life is only by the Word of God
[1:08:56] made manifest life comes only by the
[1:08:59] Word of God made manifest and he said as
[1:09:02] long as it's just in the book like this
[1:09:05] it can still be questioned but when it's
[1:09:08] made manifest then you see the product
[1:09:11] of what I speak of being manifested then
[1:09:15] that light then that is the light on the
[1:09:19] word you see that light on the word
[1:09:21] brings it it brings the product that was
[1:09:24] spoken out and here the light of the
[1:09:27] hour was shining upon them and they they
[1:09:30] that were they that were awakened to it
[1:09:33] could see that this was the one that was
[1:09:35] promised I'm so thankful that we have
[1:09:37] been awakened in this hour to see that
[1:09:40] this same Jesus it's the same one that
[1:09:43] was there with Moses in the burning bush
[1:09:45] there with Moses as he led the children
[1:09:47] of Israel and that same pool of fire as
[1:09:50] leading his children across today and we
[1:09:53] look and we see that this is the same
[1:09:55] man the same God he has dispersed
[1:09:59] himself and we could truly say as a
[1:10:01] church that God is with us we can say
[1:10:05] that God is with us and the announcement
[1:10:08] is come see a man so we look at the
[1:10:11] natural and we see we see this at this
[1:10:15] panoramic or this scene that has set
[1:10:17] before us this morning we look at the
[1:10:19] woman that had been to this whale many
[1:10:22] times she'd walked up to Jacob's Well
[1:10:24] and she'd went through this routine day
[1:10:26] in and day out but we find what was
[1:10:29] driving this woman to the whale is that
[1:10:32] she was looking for a source she was
[1:10:35] looking for a source of water and here
[1:10:38] the Bible says that that Jesus was
[1:10:41] wearied and wanted a drink
[1:10:44] but Jesus was not led there because of
[1:10:47] the natural abilities or the natural
[1:10:49] things that were causing him to go by
[1:10:51] that whale but yet the man part was
[1:10:53] wearied and he desired a drink
[1:10:55] but Jesus was not led because it was
[1:10:58] easier to walk a different path and go
[1:11:01] but Jesus was allowed to go by the way
[1:11:05] of Samaria you see because he had a need
[1:11:08] that he'd go by that way he had a need
[1:11:10] that he an passed mile that way
[1:11:12] and I want you to hear this that Jesus
[1:11:14] has got a need today to go by your way
[1:11:17] he may come to your will this morning
[1:11:20] and speak life to you if you just be
[1:11:23] ready to receive that there's a man that
[1:11:25] is standing at night well waiting for
[1:11:28] you to think that the Son of Man was
[1:11:31] standing there he was waiting on her he
[1:11:35] was not led by his natural causes to go
[1:11:38] and have a drink yet he does desire
[1:11:40] those things but he was led by the
[1:11:42] spirit to go by Samaria he was led by
[1:11:47] that way to go because you see God had
[1:11:51] shown him a vision that he had a need go
[1:11:53] by that way and you see that this
[1:11:56] message has shown a vision that he's got
[1:11:59] a need to come by your way you see he's
[1:12:01] not going to leave you where you're at
[1:12:03] he's not going to leave you in your
[1:12:04] condition he's not gonna leave you in
[1:12:06] your sickness he's not gonna leave you
[1:12:08] in your fear he's not gonna leave you in
[1:12:10] your term or he's not gonna leave you in
[1:12:12] your distress he's got a need to come by
[1:12:14] you it's the enemy that wants to keep
[1:12:16] you in house and in Kate's and envelopes
[1:12:19] in fear and distress in those things but
[1:12:22] Jesus is coming Jesus is on his way you
[1:12:26] heard it from our pastor this morning
[1:12:27] you've been anointed 4 and Jesus is on
[1:12:30] his way
[1:12:31] you've been anointed and there as a
[1:12:32] predestinated spot for you to stand in
[1:12:35] there's a predestinated spot for you to
[1:12:37] stand in and you're coming to that spot
[1:12:40] and Jesus is coming to that spot I'd say
[1:12:43] that there's a meeting that is taking
[1:12:44] place there's a meaning of the Son of
[1:12:46] Man that's coming by your way and the
[1:12:48] son of man came by and he read to her
[1:12:51] there's very secrets of the heart and
[1:12:53] the son of man is
[1:12:54] by your way I want you to prepare
[1:12:56] yourself get ready he's coming to your
[1:12:58] address this morning he's coming by your
[1:13:01] way because Jesus has got a need we
[1:13:05] think we got a need but Jesus has got to
[1:13:07] need this morning notice
[1:13:10] thirst is what drove her there and
[1:13:14] thirst here is what Webster says it's a
[1:13:18] plain for desire a painful when you want
[1:13:22] something so bad until it becomes
[1:13:25] painful to you to think that this desire
[1:13:29] had driven her to this whale or was it
[1:13:37] the plan of God you see it was a painful
[1:13:42] desire that was driving her there you
[1:13:45] see it's not unnatural it's not an act
[1:13:48] or the thirst thirst is a natural thing
[1:13:50] it's just simply something that God has
[1:13:53] given us that we we could give we could
[1:13:57] to give us a desire for something
[1:13:58] sometime God has also has given you a
[1:14:01] control tower that sets inside of you
[1:14:04] that controls these different desires
[1:14:06] and this thirst this control tower that
[1:14:10] sets in a man's heart it's something
[1:14:13] that God give him to warn him of the
[1:14:16] desires that's needful for him so God
[1:14:19] has placed in you and your own human
[1:14:22] abilities in your whole in your whole
[1:14:24] makeup there are certain things that God
[1:14:27] has placed in you that will warn you
[1:14:29] that that when you start getting those
[1:14:32] hunger pains that you need to feed on
[1:14:34] something or when you start getting that
[1:14:36] thirst for that part or that part throat
[1:14:38] that it's something that's warning you
[1:14:41] it's telling you that you need a drink
[1:14:44] and it's something that's on the inside
[1:14:46] of your body that is making you desire
[1:14:49] for those things you see God made each
[1:14:52] of us to thirst after him he made each
[1:14:56] of us to run after him and only he will
[1:14:59] satisfy that portion that he has placed
[1:15:03] on the inside of us God made us a thirst
[1:15:06] for
[1:15:06] him but Satan he perverts the true
[1:15:09] nature of God and the true thirst of God
[1:15:12] of the body and soul by lust for sin sin
[1:15:16] a perversion now we find out a person
[1:15:19] today the way they they've took that
[1:15:21] perversion thirst for God the thirst for
[1:15:24] them to be pretty and all these thirst
[1:15:28] for water they've turned that into
[1:15:31] satisfying that with drinking the thirst
[1:15:34] for Joey everybody wants to have joy
[1:15:37] first-first fellowship and all these
[1:15:39] great thirsts that God puts into us that
[1:15:42] we might thirst after him God made you
[1:15:45] to thirst after him and we try to
[1:15:48] satisfy it with some other kind of a
[1:15:50] thirst with some of the kind of a
[1:15:52] perversion of of the correct thirst see
[1:15:56] how it's in the natural see how it's in
[1:15:59] the spiritual so we look at these things
[1:16:02] that that there's something as you long
[1:16:05] to be in church you've been shut in
[1:16:07] you've been shot in there something that
[1:16:10] makes a believer long to be in there
[1:16:12] because the Prophet told us that every
[1:16:15] time those doors are open a believer
[1:16:17] wants to be there but you have been shot
[1:16:19] in because a virus there's something on
[1:16:22] the inside of you that makes you thirsty
[1:16:24] be in the church because you longed to
[1:16:27] be there where the glory of the Lord is
[1:16:29] you want to be on the end of the spout
[1:16:32] as the joys of the Lord are coming out
[1:16:34] you want to be right there you long to
[1:16:37] be there something has blocked you from
[1:16:40] receiving your thirst but I want to tell
[1:16:43] you that's a man that's on its way you
[1:16:47] see you see now if a person feels secure
[1:16:51] and they feel that they're safe or feel
[1:16:54] that they're okay they never want to
[1:16:56] come out of that spot they feel that
[1:16:59] they they don't need to be saved or they
[1:17:02] feel that they don't need to be
[1:17:03] delivered that's a person that you
[1:17:05] cannot get to if that person feels in
[1:17:08] that way they'll stay right there in
[1:17:10] that condition if they feel like they've
[1:17:13] got everything they need huh they'll
[1:17:14] stay right there and that can be
[1:17:16] but if a person is thirsty to be set
[1:17:20] free
[1:17:21] this body is groaning to be set free
[1:17:24] this body is groaning for a body change
[1:17:28] you see because something is thirsting
[1:17:31] in that realm you see it's something
[1:17:35] that Satan would love to keep me from
[1:17:37] thirsting or a believer from thirsting
[1:17:39] for but God put that there and it is
[1:17:42] such a thirst for him that no matter
[1:17:44] what Satan tries to throw he may troll
[1:17:47] and try to blow all kinds of winds here
[1:17:50] and try to dry out the church but there
[1:17:52] is an old-fashioned pouring out of the
[1:17:55] Holy Ghost that had come across you and
[1:17:57] make you fresh and make you flexible to
[1:18:00] the things of God it makes you thirst
[1:18:03] for the things of God but you see if a
[1:18:06] person's in the condition that they
[1:18:08] don't feel like they need to be set free
[1:18:09] they'll stay in that condition over in
[1:18:12] France when when the wars were going on
[1:18:14] there was a there's a prison there it's
[1:18:16] a famous prison the name of it is the
[1:18:19] Bastille prison and they had came in and
[1:18:22] they had conquered that prison and they
[1:18:24] were going to destroy that prison no man
[1:18:26] would be locked up again and so they let
[1:18:29] all the they let all the prisoners out
[1:18:31] of of the prison but there was this one
[1:18:35] man that wouldn't leave and so they let
[1:18:37] him out and told him said look we're
[1:18:39] going to destroy this prison and this
[1:18:43] man had been in there so long he'd been
[1:18:45] in there with murderers and convicts and
[1:18:48] all types of different different
[1:18:50] evildoers
[1:18:51] he'd been in there most of his life but
[1:18:53] this person he come out he'd been so
[1:18:57] bound up in darkness so long that he
[1:19:00] just when he come out it was hard on him
[1:19:02] the light was hard on him that it
[1:19:05] affected his eyes when his eyes adjusted
[1:19:08] he looked out across the city he didn't
[1:19:10] recognize the city as it was when he
[1:19:11] went in there many years before he
[1:19:13] didn't recognize the people on the
[1:19:15] street that were there many years before
[1:19:18] and he spoke to the old God he spoke to
[1:19:21] the men that were leading him out and
[1:19:23] says take me back in oh everything's
[1:19:26] changed around me
[1:19:28] I let me die with this prison I don't
[1:19:30] know I don't know anything that's going
[1:19:31] on out in the world let me die with that
[1:19:34] prison and they destroyed that prison
[1:19:37] and he died with that prison I say what
[1:19:40] a sad state for a man to be so locked up
[1:19:43] in darkness that he cannot receive light
[1:19:45] and that's what the Satan has done my
[1:19:48] other traditions of men he's locked them
[1:19:50] up so long that they cannot receive the
[1:19:53] light of this day when there's a man
[1:19:56] that is here to turn on the light
[1:19:58] he told us don't you fear a little
[1:20:00] sister there's an engineer there that's
[1:20:04] got his hand on the switz it may be
[1:20:07] talking us all about you but don't you
[1:20:09] be afraid there's a man that can turn on
[1:20:12] the light who see man was made to live
[1:20:18] and long for God and this woman's life
[1:20:21] had been so corrupted by sin so marred
[1:20:25] by sin the Prophet said in redic sin and
[1:20:29] completeness and joy he said there was a
[1:20:34] woman that came out from Samaria one
[1:20:36] time she was discouraged
[1:20:39] she was sinful had a lot of things
[1:20:42] hanging on her life perhaps she was
[1:20:47] discouraged
[1:20:48] she went to Jacob's Well for relief and
[1:20:51] she'd go back and she go to Jacob's Well
[1:20:54] and go back and one day she said the
[1:20:57] water plopped down and there was
[1:21:00] standing there discouraged I think I've
[1:21:03] just described every one of your lives
[1:21:06] but that day was a different day for her
[1:21:10] there that day that's to the rock
[1:21:13] standing boggler there have been many
[1:21:16] times that you walk to these church
[1:21:18] services and you walk to the house of
[1:21:20] God or walk to the well of God but one
[1:21:23] time when you walked up there and there
[1:21:26] was a rock that could not stop flowing
[1:21:28] that was standing there one time in his
[1:21:31] presence changed you it made you to be
[1:21:34] the man and son and daughter of God that
[1:21:37] God wanted you to be
[1:21:39] whoo you walk through life you were
[1:21:42] discouraged you were tore up things have
[1:21:44] happened to you and nobody understands
[1:21:47] all the pain that you've been through
[1:21:49] you've been through scars you've been
[1:21:52] through torments and he nobody had
[1:21:54] losses like you had ain't nobody had
[1:21:57] went through struggles like you had but
[1:21:59] one day there stood a man my whale and
[1:22:05] to think that this man was so we read in
[1:22:08] his physical frame that he was setting
[1:22:12] on the whale that you'd been to many
[1:22:13] times you'd walk to that well many times
[1:22:16] you walk 2-player you look at the well
[1:22:19] you've seen the scenery before but you
[1:22:22] ain't seen this man before
[1:22:23] but when you come into this meaning you
[1:22:26] see it set all the meeting is set upon
[1:22:29] thirst the conference is set upon thirst
[1:22:32] you'd watched it you've seen when you
[1:22:34] are we're not allowed to go up there
[1:22:37] with all the other women in the cool of
[1:22:40] the day because of your life because of
[1:22:44] the things that you had hanging on your
[1:22:46] sin upon your life you had become
[1:22:49] discouraged you have become distraught
[1:22:51] because of all of the things that were
[1:22:54] hanging under your life you couldn't go
[1:22:56] to the well with everybody else there
[1:23:01] was a man that was willing to come to
[1:23:04] the well with you mark the spot that he
[1:23:10] came to you I believe it's very
[1:23:13] important to us that we mark the spot
[1:23:15] that he came to us and we don't forget
[1:23:19] the things that were done at that spot
[1:23:21] that he spoke a life to us and
[1:23:23] ministered to us because it's in that
[1:23:26] spot that there's something that is
[1:23:28] prolific in the spot that he comes to
[1:23:31] you after you watch the place you watch
[1:23:34] the place that you are born in
[1:23:37] everything has a name to it and notice
[1:23:41] the spot that the woman had the whale
[1:23:44] came to him this was a remarkable spot
[1:23:47] in the scriptures firstly
[1:23:50] being that where Abraham first stopped
[1:23:53] on his coming from her on to Canaan
[1:23:57] secondly he was where God first appeared
[1:24:00] to Abraham and promised him to give the
[1:24:04] land to his seed I'd say it was a very
[1:24:07] important spot but thirdly it was a
[1:24:11] place where Abraham first built an altar
[1:24:13] to the Lord and called
[1:24:15] upon his name this spot was a very
[1:24:18] special spot to the patriarch Abraham
[1:24:21] and this woman could point back and she
[1:24:25] could say that our forefathers worshiped
[1:24:28] in this mountain but this spot was more
[1:24:31] than just a place of past worship this
[1:24:34] was a spot of a renewal this same piece
[1:24:39] of property was a piece of property that
[1:24:43] Jacob had balked he was a piece of
[1:24:46] property that you can look over in the
[1:24:48] Bible in Genesis 33 and see that when
[1:24:51] Jacob bought this piece of property for
[1:24:56] a hundred pieces of money and the Bible
[1:25:00] said that he erected there an altar and
[1:25:03] called it any he hello he is a rail
[1:25:06] which means being interpreted the strong
[1:25:11] God which means the Covenant God of
[1:25:14] Israel
[1:25:15] you see God had made a promise that the
[1:25:18] Messiah was coming that a strong one was
[1:25:21] coming and here on that day in history
[1:25:24] the strong God that covenant God the God
[1:25:28] that keeps his promises showed up for
[1:25:30] the woman that was sitting by a whale
[1:25:32] she was in a special spot she was in a
[1:25:37] spot of deliverance and to think that
[1:25:41] Jesus would say that I know Abraham
[1:25:44] before Abraham was I am and she's
[1:25:47] standing in a spot that was destined for
[1:25:51] her to stand in you see up to this spot
[1:25:56] all the things in her life had been
[1:25:58] misery
[1:25:59] she'd fell in love with men me and it
[1:26:02] broke her heart
[1:26:04] she'd felon thing fell in love with the
[1:26:06] things of the world and the things of
[1:26:08] the world there are beautiful the joys
[1:26:10] of the Lord maybe you fell in love with
[1:26:13] cigarettes or maybe you fell in love
[1:26:15] with alcohol maybe you fell in love with
[1:26:17] the wrong type of lover maybe you fell
[1:26:19] in love with all types of different
[1:26:21] sinful things but there's a man that's
[1:26:24] sitting on the well today he made a
[1:26:29] promise that he was coming this strong
[1:26:31] God is a God that's coming by your way
[1:26:34] this strong God is a God that knows what
[1:26:37] you're spending at this is a clever God
[1:26:40] that will not back down on his promises
[1:26:42] you think about today and we we started
[1:26:46] out this journey of separation and
[1:26:49] social distancing and the president
[1:26:51] asked for 15 days but now we've gone on
[1:26:54] to June the 10th now we've got a day
[1:26:57] ahead of time if God don't intervene or
[1:26:59] come and wrap for us we're gonna have to
[1:27:02] worship this way for quite some time
[1:27:04] until God gives us some relief from this
[1:27:07] thing and I'm praying even so now but
[1:27:10] see even the president the most powerful
[1:27:13] man in the nation cannot even keep his
[1:27:16] own word but here the strong God that's
[1:27:19] able to keep his promises that's able to
[1:27:22] reach her life will speak lips a year to
[1:27:24] you you're standing on a piece of
[1:27:27] property and the place that you're
[1:27:29] standing on his holy ground this
[1:27:34] property was a piece of property that
[1:27:38] Joseph his bones were buried in his
[1:27:42] bones were buried in in this this same
[1:27:45] piece of property that this woman was
[1:27:48] standing on thousands of years later
[1:27:51] when the children of Israel came out of
[1:27:53] Egypt Joseph had made them a commission
[1:27:56] that if I die down here in Egypt don't
[1:27:59] you leave my bones down here in Egypt if
[1:28:01] I go by the way of the grave here don't
[1:28:04] you leave my bones down here don't you
[1:28:06] bury me down here in some creed don't
[1:28:08] you bury me down here in this cosmos but
[1:28:11] you take me to a lay in the promised
[1:28:14] - well that's a strong one that's coming
[1:28:16] Larry the resurrection in the life is
[1:28:19] coming and Joseph as Joseph said these
[1:28:22] things and the children of Israel walk
[1:28:24] past that thing they can lay their hands
[1:28:26] over on that casket and said that we've
[1:28:29] been promised by a strong one that we're
[1:28:31] coming out of this land who don't you
[1:28:35] leave my boats out here don't you get
[1:28:37] buried in some Trinitarian baptism where
[1:28:40] there is no resurrection don't you be
[1:28:42] buried in some trucks world ISM you'd be
[1:28:45] buried in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:28:47] Christ be buried in the promise she was
[1:28:52] standing at a spot where Joseph knew
[1:28:54] that there was one coming she was
[1:28:56] standing at a spot where Joseph knew
[1:28:58] that the resurrection and the life was
[1:29:00] coming she was standing on a piece of
[1:29:02] property and owned that same piece of
[1:29:05] property where Abraham worship the son
[1:29:08] of man was standing there who you've
[1:29:12] stood in this spot before but this time
[1:29:14] it's different when you look as Jesus
[1:29:20] passes by and John chapter five five and
[1:29:23] he passes by the Pool of Bethesda and
[1:29:26] here he is he's doing the works of the
[1:29:29] Father and because he does the works of
[1:29:32] the Father and he heals on the Sabbath
[1:29:35] that the Pharisees of the day they
[1:29:37] sought to stone him but Jesus turns to
[1:29:40] them and he says the son can do nothing
[1:29:43] of himself but what he seeth if the
[1:29:46] father do for what thing soever he doeth
[1:29:48] these also the son likewise and Jesus
[1:29:52] said believe me because the works sake
[1:29:54] he said search the Scriptures for in
[1:29:57] them you think you have eternal life but
[1:30:00] they are they that testify of me you see
[1:30:04] they were looking for the Messiah to
[1:30:05] come in a different manner and do the
[1:30:07] works in a different manner but here
[1:30:10] Jesus was doing the works of the Father
[1:30:15] and they would not believe him because
[1:30:18] the works sake they would not believe
[1:30:21] him because they were expecting him to
[1:30:23] come in a different manner
[1:30:26] but here the all-knowing God the
[1:30:28] omniscient God was making himself known
[1:30:31] to a little woman to a little woman with
[1:30:35] the Scarlet past he was manifesting
[1:30:37] himself to a woman not a Pharisee not to
[1:30:40] the teachers of the day but a thirsty
[1:30:43] vessel was he revealing himself too and
[1:30:47] I want you I don't don't miss these
[1:30:50] events that are transpiring here the
[1:30:54] things that have led up to the moments
[1:30:56] of scars the complexes she's not able to
[1:30:59] walk to the whale with everybody else
[1:31:01] she's rejected by everybody else her
[1:31:06] past relationships had led her to this
[1:31:08] spot she was walking alone because of
[1:31:13] her career and this little woman she
[1:31:20] know that her days was about finished up
[1:31:22] her occupation would be ruined you
[1:31:27] understand what I say so she was
[1:31:29] thinking about what would I do but she
[1:31:32] said you know I've always thought that
[1:31:35] some day there might be the Messiah come
[1:31:38] she was walking up there and it's
[1:31:42] usually when you're thinking about him
[1:31:44] when he comes along so she walked up
[1:31:49] layer darkness all the women was gone
[1:31:52] away she was immoral couldn't speak with
[1:31:54] them or nothing had the hooks and she
[1:31:57] let the window down and she started she
[1:32:00] heard a man say go call your husband
[1:32:04] come here Bible says in John 4:12 are
[1:32:08] thou greater than our fathers Jacob
[1:32:11] which gave us as well and drink thereof
[1:32:14] of himself and his children and his
[1:32:15] cattle and jesus answered and said unto
[1:32:17] her whosoever drinketh of this water
[1:32:19] shall thirst again but whosoever
[1:32:22] drinketh of the water that I should give
[1:32:23] him shall never thirst but the water
[1:32:26] that I shall give him shall be in him a
[1:32:29] well of water springing up unto
[1:32:31] everlasting life the woman saith unto
[1:32:34] him Sir give me this water that I thirst
[1:32:36] not neither come
[1:32:38] the hitherto draw and Jesus ain't saving
[1:32:42] her go call thy husband and come hither
[1:32:46] and the woman answered and said I have
[1:32:49] no home and husband and jesus said unto
[1:32:52] her thou has well said that I have no
[1:32:54] husband
[1:32:55] for thou has had five husbands he whom
[1:32:59] thou now hast is not thy husband and in
[1:33:03] this thou says now truly say it's thou
[1:33:07] truly and the woman said sir I perceive
[1:33:15] thou art a prophet you see you look at
[1:33:21] this event that is transpiring here that
[1:33:25] he's not calling out to the theologians
[1:33:28] of the day but he's calling out to a
[1:33:30] woman that has a need he's calling out
[1:33:33] to a woman and here she watches as Jesus
[1:33:37] reveals the secrets of her heart to her
[1:33:41] he tells her he does not tell her all
[1:33:43] things but he tells her her trouble he
[1:33:47] tells her where she's troubled at that
[1:33:50] same one will tell you where your
[1:33:53] troubles at that same one will speak to
[1:33:55] you where your troubles at and minister
[1:33:58] life to you he won't leave you in that
[1:34:00] trouble spot he won't leave you in a
[1:34:03] time of trouble for in a time of trouble
[1:34:06] he will hide you in his pavilion you see
[1:34:11] the Jews would receive one that could
[1:34:14] reveal the secrets of the heart because
[1:34:18] the Prophet had told him I say ya 11:01
[1:34:21] that there shall come for the rod out of
[1:34:23] the stem of Jesse and a branch shall
[1:34:26] grow out of his roots notice and the
[1:34:29] Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him
[1:34:31] the spirit of wisdom and understanding
[1:34:33] the spirit of counsel and might the
[1:34:36] spirit of knowledge and of the fear of
[1:34:38] the Lord shall rest upon him so they
[1:34:42] were looking for one that could reveal
[1:34:45] the very secrets of their heart and
[1:34:48] discern the things of the heart
[1:34:50] and here the son of man was revealing
[1:34:53] this woman's heart and the Prophet told
[1:34:57] us that the ability to discern the
[1:34:59] hearts thoughts and men made the elect
[1:35:02] of God to understand that here was the
[1:35:05] messiah the anointed Word of God
[1:35:08] what have we you and I we received today
[1:35:12] this has been him speaking this has been
[1:35:15] more than just a man that has come to
[1:35:20] your address and called you out I see
[1:35:22] you I see you you're sitting there in
[1:35:24] the hospital room and I see you you've
[1:35:27] been you've been dr. Don and it's a it's
[1:35:29] a fat doctor that's working on you and
[1:35:31] he's told you that you're going to die
[1:35:33] with this but that says the Lord you
[1:35:36] said that da band live who was this that
[1:35:40] was speaking for the Bible tells us in
[1:35:42] Hebrews are now four and twelve that the
[1:35:45] word of God is quick this has been the
[1:35:47] word that is alive that is speaking to
[1:35:50] us and powerful and sharper than any
[1:35:53] two-edged sword piercing even to the
[1:35:56] dividing of the sonder of soul in a
[1:35:58] spirit and of the joints and the marrow
[1:36:00] and the discerner of the thoughts and
[1:36:03] the intents of the heart
[1:36:04] this is he that is speaking that same
[1:36:09] God that spoke back there in the
[1:36:11] wilderness is the same one that spoke
[1:36:13] there that this is my beloved Son in
[1:36:17] whom I am well pleased to dwell when
[1:36:22] John the Baptist was there baptizing on
[1:36:25] the Jordan River as he's standing there
[1:36:28] and he's baptizing them under repentance
[1:36:32] and he said that i baptize you with
[1:36:34] water unto repentance but there's one
[1:36:37] coming after me that's mightier than I
[1:36:41] and I am not worthy to bow down and
[1:36:44] unloose the straps off of his sandals i
[1:36:47] baptize you with water but the one that
[1:36:51] is coming will baptize you with the Holy
[1:36:53] Ghost and with fire john was introducing
[1:36:58] the Messiah
[1:37:00] and in the second coming of Christ there
[1:37:03] has been one that has introduced us to
[1:37:06] the one that has baptized us with Holy
[1:37:09] Ghost and with fire he did not point to
[1:37:13] himself he was pointing to the man Jesus
[1:37:16] for there is no other mediator given
[1:37:19] unto us between man or God but the man
[1:37:23] Jesus Christ
[1:37:24] that man bore your stripes that man this
[1:37:29] coming week walked up the heels and one
[1:37:33] day they're screaming Hosanna to the
[1:37:35] king and the next week they're spitting
[1:37:38] on him that man did it for you
[1:37:43] that man had to in his mind that man
[1:37:47] when he was taken across had you on his
[1:37:49] mind when he had a need to go by the
[1:37:52] will of Samaria it was because of one
[1:37:57] put it didn't just stop with one it led
[1:38:01] to many what has he been doing and
[1:38:05] lighting the torch fires he's been
[1:38:08] lighting one and you watch as that fire
[1:38:11] grows who you see all the events that
[1:38:16] led her to this spot I think God does
[1:38:21] everything will God does everything
[1:38:24] perfectly all of the events that had
[1:38:26] transpired in her life led her to this
[1:38:29] crucial moment you see if she was there
[1:38:33] in that condition of a Pharisee she
[1:38:36] would have missed it but this was a
[1:38:38] woman that was in a spot of
[1:38:40] discouragement who could say that she
[1:38:43] was shot in she was isolated she was
[1:38:46] quarantined from everybody around her
[1:38:49] nobody wanted to be near her they
[1:38:51] thought that she might have some kind of
[1:38:52] disease that would pass on to somebody
[1:38:54] else nobody wanted to be around her but
[1:38:59] this man Jesus this man Jesus thought
[1:39:05] who thought that she was worth going out
[1:39:08] away for this here would have been
[1:39:11] easier for Jesus to go another way he
[1:39:15] had been now he'd walked those paths
[1:39:18] before he knew the layout of the land he
[1:39:20] was the one that created that land but
[1:39:23] this man was so the son of God that he
[1:39:28] was led by the Spirit of husbands and
[1:39:36] the one you're now living with she
[1:39:40] played the part of a harlot she had been
[1:39:44] marred up by sin she'd been corrupted
[1:39:46] men had let her down but the one that
[1:39:50] was sitting on that whale would not let
[1:39:52] her down he would be with her even in
[1:39:55] her to the end of the world
[1:39:56] there were men that would come in and
[1:39:58] would abuse her but this man was coming
[1:40:01] in to love her that was men that would
[1:40:03] come in and would take her that would
[1:40:06] take her and destroy her virtues but
[1:40:08] this man was restoring her virtues back
[1:40:11] to her look at what this man has done to
[1:40:15] the body of Jesus Christ he's not
[1:40:17] stripped you down but he's built you up
[1:40:19] come and see a man that has restored the
[1:40:22] glory to the Church of Jesus Christ
[1:40:25] this same Jesus is walking on the water
[1:40:28] to you hallelujah Satan makes you think
[1:40:35] that you don't win too far but I want to
[1:40:37] tell you the blood goes further Satan
[1:40:40] wants to tell you that she can't get it
[1:40:41] but Jesus says you can get it
[1:40:43] Satan wants to tell you that you can't
[1:40:46] be filled with the Holy Ghost but he
[1:40:48] said that this promise is unto you and
[1:40:51] then your children as many as the Lord
[1:40:53] our God shall call and he's still
[1:40:56] calling Oh hallelujah
[1:40:59] Satan says you can't got no right to sit
[1:41:02] there Satan says she guilty but yet a
[1:41:05] prostitute was sitting and a well with
[1:41:09] God she was rejected by the other women
[1:41:12] she was rejected by the morals of the
[1:41:16] men that were living in that city but
[1:41:18] here
[1:41:19] she was accepted by the Messiah the
[1:41:24] mighty one the strong water the one that
[1:41:34] would make away for her what men had
[1:41:40] rejected her he would stand up for her
[1:41:43] wouldn't men and women would turn their
[1:41:45] back from her turn their nose at her not
[1:41:50] looking her in the face this man stood
[1:41:54] up for her that same man stood up for me
[1:42:00] and you I'm not gonna stand for myself
[1:42:05] he stood up for me and the moments that
[1:42:07] I thought I was truly standing it was
[1:42:10] only that he was holding me up sometimes
[1:42:15] when the battle gets too tough that's
[1:42:18] when he's ever so close that's when he's
[1:42:21] got his arms so completely around you
[1:42:24] and he's still standing up for you he
[1:42:27] stood up for you 2,000 years ago and
[1:42:30] he's still standing and looking
[1:42:32] revelations 10 and you see the mighty
[1:42:34] angel standing with a foot on the land
[1:42:37] and the foot on the sea that man has
[1:42:41] told you and gave your message he gave
[1:42:44] you a message hello run your right
[1:42:46] straight into a rapture right straight
[1:42:48] into her body change he stood up for you
[1:42:52] you look back at the fall when reasoning
[1:42:58] had got the best of he when she leaned
[1:43:03] to her own understanding when she did
[1:43:05] not trust him what God said but she
[1:43:08] leaned to her own understanding and her
[1:43:10] own understanding got her in trouble
[1:43:16] Adam stood up for her
[1:43:21] hallelujah hallelujah why because she
[1:43:25] was a part of heat and there was no way
[1:43:29] that Adam was going to allow Eve to be
[1:43:32] destroyed because she was a part of him
[1:43:36] and Satan thinks he's got the best of
[1:43:39] you and thinks he's going to rob you and
[1:43:42] kill you and he may give you a cancer he
[1:43:45] may pin you in the car he may pin you
[1:43:47] with the disease but how can he rob you
[1:43:50] how can he destroy you when you are a
[1:43:52] part of him you can't do it there's one
[1:43:57] that stood up for me and he stood up for
[1:44:00] you come and see a man in the bridge the
[1:44:06] Prophet said now the forfeited title
[1:44:09] deed is now in the hands of the original
[1:44:11] holder Almighty God the title deed to
[1:44:14] the earth and to eternal life when Adam
[1:44:16] forfeited then Satan start his hands
[1:44:19] could not take it so he went back to the
[1:44:23] original owner God himself you see Satan
[1:44:26] when this when this transaction was
[1:44:29] taking place Satan tried to reach over
[1:44:32] there and grab ahold of your name he
[1:44:35] tried his best to grab a hold onto your
[1:44:38] life but that was a bo asset stood up
[1:44:40] for you
[1:44:41] there was a redeemer that stood up for
[1:44:43] you who you can rest a little Ruth
[1:44:47] there's one that's bigger than you don't
[1:44:50] know worry just rest in the promise he
[1:44:53] stood up for you he'll pay for you he'll
[1:44:56] redeem you hallelujah
[1:44:59] he'll redeem you and redemption means to
[1:45:02] buy back and it searched all the way
[1:45:05] back he searched it all the way back
[1:45:07] through your ancestors and all the way
[1:45:10] down through your DNA chain and there's
[1:45:12] no sickness you may have dealt with
[1:45:14] sickness in your life your family may
[1:45:16] have died with fish or died with that
[1:45:18] but the title deed says that you are
[1:45:21] redeemed you are not locked into a DNA
[1:45:25] chain of men that will destroy your
[1:45:27] vessels you're locked into a blood cell
[1:45:30] that's the very life of Jesus Christ
[1:45:33] that is greater than sickness that's
[1:45:35] greater than sin that's greater than
[1:45:37] torment that's greater than any
[1:45:39] temptation this blood this blood stands
[1:45:46] for you whoo hallelujah there was a gap
[1:45:53] there was a gap between between men and
[1:45:58] God but in this day there has been a
[1:46:02] blood there has been a token there has
[1:46:05] been a lamb that bridged the gap from
[1:46:07] God to humanity and you can walk across
[1:46:10] that bridge you can go across there go
[1:46:13] and look in the message look and you'll
[1:46:15] see when brother branham tells us that
[1:46:18] God bridged the gap there was somebody
[1:46:22] that stood up for you
[1:46:25] there was a great chasm that stood
[1:46:27] between you and God but all the blood of
[1:46:30] Jesus hold the blood of Jesus he can't
[1:46:34] destroy you because when he looks upon
[1:46:37] you he don't see you he don't see your
[1:46:40] need he sees his son he sees those
[1:46:46] stripes that he gladly took a pilot's
[1:46:51] judgment when they would take the
[1:46:55] cat-o'-nine-tails and they would rip
[1:47:01] from him his flesh and the blood would
[1:47:05] gush from him come see me little hem of
[1:47:15] God it takes away the sin have you
[1:47:23] they can't have one Harrier hit he can't
[1:47:28] touch your life I love what the Prophet
[1:47:32] said and in future home when he reads
[1:47:36] when he reads what Jesus said over in
[1:47:39] the book of Matthew the heaven earth
[1:47:41] will pass away but my word will never
[1:47:43] pass away and the Prophet looks into
[1:47:45] that word pass away it means to change
[1:47:49] and the Prophet said a paragraph one
[1:47:52] eighty he said the earth will be loosed
[1:47:55] from the grip of Satan
[1:47:57] it'll be loosed it'll be loosed from
[1:47:59] politics it'll be loosed from
[1:48:01] denominational religious systems to be
[1:48:03] used for the kingdoms of God to be
[1:48:05] established here on the earth but as
[1:48:08] long as it's in the hands of Satan Satan
[1:48:11] the rule of the earth he owns it he
[1:48:13] belonged to him but now Christ has
[1:48:16] redeemed it one time I was his property
[1:48:19] but not now one time that little woman
[1:48:23] was his property but not now see he come
[1:48:26] to loosen the grip of it he loosed the
[1:48:29] group of sin the grip of sin of Satan
[1:48:31] upon the hope of my life upon your life
[1:48:34] and now we're not here have you often
[1:48:37] heard me say in prayer take your hands
[1:48:39] off of God's property have faith to
[1:48:42] claim your own that's your rights
[1:48:43] take your hands over her take your hands
[1:48:46] off of him see faith will do it faith
[1:48:48] will do that Oh am I not even i elated
[1:48:51] but take your hands off of to loosen
[1:48:54] learn let it go pass it away it changes
[1:48:57] the earth will change politics will
[1:49:00] change the religions will change
[1:49:02] denominations will pass away but tyre
[1:49:04] politics will pass away but the kingdom
[1:49:07] of God shall be established everything
[1:49:11] will pass away but this kingdom that you
[1:49:14] have received is a kingdom that cannot
[1:49:16] be sucked down it is established it is
[1:49:20] the kingdom of God Oh hallelujah I love
[1:49:24] what the Prophet said he said the earth
[1:49:26] redeemed goes back to its original owner
[1:49:29] he took it from Satan he pulled and
[1:49:32] taken the earth away from Satan
[1:49:35] just just like he took you away from
[1:49:39] Satan Alleluia
[1:49:42] just like he took you away from Satan
[1:49:45] like he took that little woman after
[1:49:47] well away from Satan he took her away
[1:49:52] from Satan how he'll hates that out of
[1:49:56] all the trillions of people he chose her
[1:49:59] and of all the trillions and billions of
[1:50:02] people he chose you when there was
[1:50:06] looking like somebody that was more
[1:50:08] qualified he chose you
[1:50:10] when there looked like somebody that
[1:50:11] knew more scripture than you he chose
[1:50:13] you when you didn't know which way to go
[1:50:15] he tells you when you were scarred up he
[1:50:18] chose you when you were messed up he
[1:50:20] chose you hallelujah
[1:50:22] hell has messed up hell has messed up by
[1:50:27] putting his hands on God's property they
[1:50:29] have no legal right because you don't
[1:50:31] belong to sin you don't belong to Satan
[1:50:34] you belong to God and he took you away
[1:50:37] from Satan just like he took the woman a
[1:50:40] well away from Satan
[1:50:42] how hates hell hell hates that he'll has
[1:50:47] to hate that you see because that day
[1:50:50] he'll lost ten thousand worlds oh I hope
[1:50:56] you follow me he'll lost ten thousand
[1:50:59] worlds that day the Prophet said that
[1:51:01] once those worth ten thousand worlds you
[1:51:05] think about the value that Satan lost
[1:51:07] that day when when Jesus came and took
[1:51:12] her away from Satan how much more how
[1:51:17] much more as he looked across this body
[1:51:19] of Jesus Christ that he redeemed you
[1:51:21] Hale has lost thousands upon thousands
[1:51:25] upon millions of worlds when he'd win
[1:51:28] Jesus took you away from Satan he took
[1:51:32] you away from Satan you don't belong to
[1:51:35] Satan but he looses the grip of Satan
[1:51:39] all of this transpired because the man
[1:51:44] we read
[1:51:46] and the man desired a trick woman give
[1:51:52] me the trinket the man part was weird
[1:51:57] but the God part said I will give you
[1:52:00] everlasting water
[1:52:01] that's how beyond me inside of you a
[1:52:04] water that's an ever untried it'll
[1:52:07] spring up into everlasting water notice
[1:52:10] the man part Jesus was wearied but the
[1:52:13] God part had dispersed something on the
[1:52:16] inside of her
[1:52:17] you see thirst drove her there and there
[1:52:20] was an eternal seed that was laying
[1:52:22] there on the inside of her and notice
[1:52:24] the atmosphere that was created on that
[1:52:27] piece of property that brought to life
[1:52:30] this would a woman it was her seed but
[1:52:34] it was his force that called that seat
[1:52:37] up Oh hallelujah you remember when he
[1:52:41] came by your way and you heard his voice
[1:52:43] speak for the first time we read over
[1:52:46] these scriptures we know about the
[1:52:49] Messiah we know about these things but
[1:52:52] for the very first time that he shows
[1:52:57] himself openly that I am the Messiah he
[1:53:03] speaks to a woman of ill-fame you think
[1:53:08] about that think about this woman think
[1:53:14] about all the things that were against
[1:53:16] her think about her life think about the
[1:53:19] things that were stacked up against her
[1:53:20] but she was the very first one there's
[1:53:25] been other denominations there's been
[1:53:27] greater maybe greater sisters that look
[1:53:30] greater in stature but you're the first
[1:53:32] one you're the first one that has been
[1:53:35] able to testify come and see a man that
[1:53:38] he promised that there was coming and
[1:53:40] returning a Malachi 4 and you are the
[1:53:43] wards that are testifying that this is
[1:53:46] the day it was his voice but it was your
[1:53:52] seed brother Jeffrey it was your seed
[1:53:56] that he calls
[1:53:58] come awaken to the voice when his voice
[1:54:02] speaks it brings life you can go back
[1:54:09] over the moments that you were standing
[1:54:12] in your spot and you were enclosed with
[1:54:16] fear
[1:54:18] you were enclosed with captivity of
[1:54:22] bondage but they came one
[1:54:32] he told her of her sins he revealed her
[1:54:35] secrets
[1:54:37] said I would receive your prophet and
[1:54:41] all of a sudden she begin to get
[1:54:42] religious said I fathers worshipped here
[1:54:49] and they told us that there was a
[1:54:50] messiah coming and he turns to her and
[1:54:55] says i that speak unto thee i am he you
[1:55:01] could imagine the shock wave this sent
[1:55:06] he starts reading to her her life and he
[1:55:10] starts describing to her the intricate
[1:55:13] details we only know what is placed out
[1:55:15] here and he didn't tell her all things
[1:55:18] but he told her we're in trouble of us
[1:55:21] you can imagine he sees reading her life
[1:55:24] she's having a personal interview was
[1:55:28] the great I am and she forgets the very
[1:55:35] purpose that she's there sometimes you

[1:55:42] selfish motives why you're going to
[1:55:45] church you're going to receive the
[1:55:47] benefits of being a Christian sometimes
[1:55:49] you got your own selfish motives but one
[1:55:53] day when it comes and says I'll that

[2:08:57] losin track there ever is and he will
[2:09:00] continue to have a losin track he is the
[2:09:02] most losing this person there is
[2:09:05] throughout eternity
[2:09:06] Satan prepare to lose again we've seen
[2:09:11] this same one in action amongst us have

[2:09:20] mysteries to tell of all the miracles
[2:09:23] that's come by our way but I want you as
[2:09:27] I speak these things to stir up your
[2:09:28] pure mind by the way of remembrance of

[2:09:54] those testimonies write down those
[2:09:56] things that it was the same man that
