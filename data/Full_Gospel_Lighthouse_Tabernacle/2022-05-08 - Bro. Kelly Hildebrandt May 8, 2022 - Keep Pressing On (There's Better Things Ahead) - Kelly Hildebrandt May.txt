spencer if he would come just pray over these requests this morning you pray as he prays over on this morning before we go to prayer i just want to share a story a quick testimony about uh here a couple weeks ago when we were going down me and sarah were going down to louisiana for the the youth meeting there me and me and sarah were really wanting to go and wanting to be a part of those meetings and when i got this new position there was some training that got pushed back and there was some training that got put pushed into place there that same week so we discussed it and was uh we were we were thinking you know would it be okay if we go we won't be able to leave till that friday evening or that saturday we'll miss most of the meeting and she said you know yeah let's let's go ahead and make the trip maybe we can see our friends down there stay with them for a little bit and so we we decided to go ahead and try and put the put the flight into place and we couldn't get it on that friday afternoon um so we we ended up being able to the earliest flight we could get the only flight we could get was that saturday at 11 and so we said let's just take it we'll be able to make the trip get there right on time for service and i'll be able to be there for ron and hear him and then hear brother andrew on sunday morning so at friday night after the training i was i was back at the house and i was just listening to brother donny and i was praying and i said you know lord i want you to move in a supernatural way this weekend i know there's already supernatural things going on and many things going on in the meetings already but i want you to move in a supernatural way and what i didn't realize is god was going to place me and sarah and it had always been it had already been put into place he was gonna put us in a position that he was gonna use us and matter of fact i really once we got on the flight you know i was ready to go back kick back and go to sleep and as we got on the plane um this this uh guy sitting down beside us very aggressive like when he sat down i actually leaned over to sarah and i said you know there's a very dark spirit about this uh this guy you know i knew he had about an hour and a half long trip i really wasn't to sit down i just wanted to kick back and go to sleep not have any issues and he kept sitting up leaning forward sitting up leaning forward sitting back against the seat and so i just put my headphones in as i normally would kickback was going to sleep well she leaned over to me and said you know i think he's a musician he's listening to songs and he would go back to his notes and type it so i would i'm i got nosy and i said well i just want to see what he's writing i want to see what kind of song he's writing and so i i stayed where i was at and he would lean forward he popped his notes open and was was typing those notes and i read the first line to one of those notes and he would open it and show it real quick when i read the first line i didn't believe what i was reading and i said lord there's no way like you know if that's if that's what he's writing and that's why you have us on this flight you're gonna have to give me the words to say because i'm not sure how to even go about starting this conversation but if you've put us here for that purpose if this is why we're late to get into these meetings you're gonna have you're gonna have to give me the words to say and as soon as i prayed that i i watched him and then he pulled it back up and he left it on that on the very top of that note and the line that i saw he had highlighted it moved it to the bottom and that very first note the line the first sentence that he put in that he said if you're reading this i'm no longer alive and he scrolled all the way down to the bottom and the line that he had moved said so i killed myself and the guy was sitting right beside us writing his suicide note well immediately just as it is right now my heart my heart just started beating out of my chest i'm like all right well that's all right this is why we're here you're gonna have to you're gonna have to give me the words to say and um so i didn't mention anything to sarah and i was thinking the whole time you know if this goes wrong we've got another hour 45 minutes we've got our long trip with this guy and but then it hit me you know well if it goes right you need enough time to talk to him so i just i bumped him gave it a couple more minutes and then i just went ahead and bumped him again and i said i sorry buddy i don't mean to keep hitting you and he just kind of looked up he had real dark circles under his eyes and i began talking to him and uh asking what he was doing where he was coming from he had a toronto hat on and so he said his dad was from canada and the story started out he was going to houston and by the end of the story he was going to florida i'm really not sure if he really cared where he was going to but he was making the trip down and i began speaking to him sarah began speaking to him about what he did in his life what job he did and just kind of connecting there with him and um and then he turned to us and he said well what are you guys doing and he kind of opened that door and i said we're going down here to a church meeting now i'm down in louisiana and i said we're going to listen to my uncle preach and i said you know he actually has stage four cancer and two years ago they gave him four months to live and said you know the doctors here recently told him are you ready to give up and he told them and he's told us the same thing no i'm not going to give up this life's worth fighting for and he i told him i said you know i've sat and watched him and he goes through battles and he's got a life sentence over his head and he's taking all these treatments but he's still fighting because this life's worth fighting for and i said you know we get caught up in all the the nonsense of the world and we get caught up in the things of the world of who's around us and said people now they care about the money that they're making they care about everything else other than the person sitting next to them and we need more people that care about the people that's sitting next to us because we don't know what they're fighting and so then we went on talking it got a little quiet i leaned back over to him and i said the plane was landing i said remember this life's worth fighting for it's life's worth fighting for and he just put his head down he said yeah well as we were getting up he went back to that note highlighted that entire note and deleted the whole thing and as we were getting off the plane i told him you know we had we had to get to our next trip and as we were getting off i heard him and he was upbeat and he was chipper he was talking to the people getting off the flight completely different from how he was when he got on and we were already taking off at a pretty quick pace to get to our next flight so we didn't miss it and he called back out to us and he said gabe sarah and i turned around and he said be safe have a good trip well i went back i shook his hand and i said everything's gonna be okay you just keep fighting like you know keep fighting and doing what you're doing and he shook my hand and uh we hugged each other up and he said thank you thank you seriously thank you and you know when i think about that you know it took me stepping out of my comfort zone and all of us here we don't know where god's going to put us and a lot of times we may have to step out of our comfort zone to be able to reach that person next to us and it may be a conversation that's hard a conversation that i've never had it's a note that i've never actually even read even when it comes to in the line of work that i work in i haven't even ever read one and as i'm reading it just hit me we don't know what everybody's fighting everybody has a different battle and as we heard last night you know the every battle that we have it may come it may come um even for us here and may be holding us back from the blessing that god gives us and i'm believing that this morning if there's any anything any any minute detail that's in our life that we can release i'm believing that we can we can let go of that this morning and have a closer walk from with god after after this meeting this morning let's just go to prayer gracious heavenly father lord we just thank you for what you're doing for us in these services and we thank you for the minister of the hour that has flown all these ways he's he's traveled a million miles and lord jesus just as we heard last night we knew the we knew the warning that he gave to us the last time he brought a coin and even he may not even realize the how how important that coin would be as he would as that coin would say full victory and then last night as he comes and he brings that statue of david and he's standing on the head of goliath lord and as we have it play across before the services goliath's last day lord jesus i just know and i believe that this is more than just another service this is more than just another weekend i'm believing that every prayer request that has been brought forth this morning every prayer request that may be spoken or unspoken can just be delivered because lord jesus we believe in a god that is the same yesterday today and forever and lord jesus i'm just believing that you will just come down and just use this minister like you've never used him before give him more energy more than he's ever had before that he can just bring forth the message of the hour that we are needing to hear and whatever his desire of his heart is i'm believing that he would just speak speak that in in a mighty powerful way that you could just speak to our heart you know exactly what each and every one of us needs it may be a lost loved one it may be a physical uh physical condition it may be a surgery or sickness that we are fighting this morning but whatever it is i just ask that you just anoint the people that whatever we're fighting this morning that we can just let loose to that thing forgive us of anything that may be hindering us from where we are at and our walk with you i ask that you will just forgive us and and allow us to move closer to you lord jesus because your mercy it covers all lord and i just ask that you will just move across and anoint the audience anoint the minister of the hour this morning that you will just come and speak to our lives we just thank you for what you were already doing we thank you for what you were going to do lord jesus because it is already done it is already finished lord jesus and the healing's there and i'm just believing for a full complete miracle a full complete victory of our pastor lord and that sugar as it may fight them as the as the tumors the the medicine what everything that is fighting against our pastor i believe that one of these days that bell will be rang and he will not have to take those those treatments no more he will not have to go to the doctors and them tell him you know the cancer's still there it's still like it was when it first started i'm believing that he will go in and because we were we don't believe the doctors reports we hear them we see them but lord jesus we believe your report and we're believing for a full healing this morning and we just thank you for what you were doing in jesus name we pray amen [Music] amen good to be here this morning isn't it we just know the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the lord amen amen as we take up this morning's offering just come and lay it here on the altar i sing a song i have decided to follow jesus maybe his sister

wonderful than my mind can conceive he's more wonderful [Music] then my heart can believe and he goes beyond my highest hopes and fondest dreams [Music] he said everything [Music] oh that my soul [Music] and so much more than amazing [Music] more than more than less more than could ever be oh he's more than wonderful that's what jesus says to me [Music] i stand amazed when i think that the king of glory should come to dwell [Music] i marvel just to know that he really loves me when i think of who he is and who i am for he's more wonderful than my mind can conceive he's more wonderful [Music] trees [Music] he's everything oh that my soul ever longed for he's everything that he's promised and so much more he's more than [Music] amazing he's more than miraculous could it ever be oh he's more than wonderful that's what jesus says to me he's more than amazing [Music] more than marvelous he's more than miraculous [Music] could ever be oh he's more than wonderful that's what jesus says to me [Music] hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord amen the book of hebrews tells us that these promises are are more and greater when you study out the book of hebrews and jesus truly is greater than we could ever imagine amen he truly is and we just would like to say happy mother's day to each and every one of you mothers today grandmothers and soon-to-be mothers and brother branham would say in the message mother's day said lord we would not by no means forget to thank you for real mothers for we know that we have such living today real genuine mothers god bless them they are great treasures to us and we pray that you will continue to be with them lord and may they live happy and see the fruit of their womb serving god i pray that the lord would grant each and every one of you the desires of your heart today just as just a little note to the mothers that if anybody that wasn't here last evening uh sister connie and the sisters uh have something for you after service today if you didn't receive receive your gift last evening you can just meet sister connie at the back door and just uh just a little testimony before we go forward with a couple more announcements quickly this week we again we're always constantly reminded how powerful life is and how wonderful that it is to have the vision of isaac to be with us but again this week sister whitney had to go to the doctor and sister whitney has actually just just the lord has done something spectacular for her in the last little bit she she'd had quite a bit of issues with different things that she could and couldn't eat and different allergies to different things but ever since the prayer line last last week at the tent meeting she's been able to eat anything and everything's that she wants [Applause] hallelujah for those that know it's a great miracle it's a great miracle but while she was at the doctor the doctor the doctor was looking over her exam and different things and was just just bombarded with the the thought of how amazing that it is she's she spoke these words i'm just i'm flabbergasted that you are able to have children because all of your female organs she said it's it's usual it can be usual for somebody's organs to be twisted but for somebody's organs to be twisted and flipped backwards it's uncommon and there's no way that you should have been able to have children but our god who is rich in mercy saw fit that there would be seed brought forth in this day to this we are thankful to this we are thankful amen amen god is so good to us we'd like to welcome brother joseph and his family with us they they're originally from minnesota i understand and they will be so journeying with us they he has a job in charlottesville and he'll be so journeying here with us in the in the shenandoah valley so we want to make him feel a part of the family here and we just want to greet you and say you're welcome here and we love you with the love of the lord may god richly bless you amen also next sunday we will be having a baptism brother roy if you wouldn't mind filling the baptismal tank for us for that uh that will be next sunday after the service so anybody that would like to be baptized and take on the name of the lord jesus christ just send us a note that way we don't miss anybody that does want to i know that we have one as of right now but anybody else that would desire to take on the name of the lord it's it's one of the ordinances that our lord left us to do and we want to do that because it's a it's a sign that you're not just taking on you're not just taking on a man's name but you're taking on the name of heaven and it's the most powerful name that there is there's no other name where men should be saved but by the name of the lord and then that that day we will also have communion so we will fulfill two ordinances that day will have communion and then we will have the baptism shortly after we will run the the communion as we have done in the past but we'll let you come through and then go back to your pews and then take your seat or just wait until we're all through and then we'll partake of it together amen so we're just looking for these things i trust that we are ready for the rapture of the lord and i i i'd be happy if we don't get to fulfill these commitments that we're making but we just go right here this morning amen are you looking for him this morning amen would you stand with us this morning listening that song that i could still go free you can lock me up in the prison as brother kelly hildebrandt comes and makes his way wasn't last night just prophetic i was so blessed last evening to just to hear the word of the lord and i have to tell you my heart is excited this morning to hear what god has for us as brother kelly comes let's just set the atmosphere and the atmosphere is already said but let's just enter into a place of worship and you know i got a note this morning criticizing our worship and i you know i wouldn't normally i normally wouldn't say anything about it but somebody was criticizing our sound of freedom and our signature that we have up here on this board that they were making criticism about those things but i have to say you pardon the noise it's just our sound of freedom [Applause] hallelujah [Music] [Applause] you know david said in first chronicles 25 i was reading this this morning because the lord was prepping me before i wrote this idiot back this morning it said moreover david and the captains of the host separated to service of the sons of asaph and of the human and of jeddah who should prophesy with harps and with sultry and with symbols and the number of the workmen according to their service was so the bible says to prophesy with harps to prophesy with symbols so if we accept these words if we accept the anointed songs in the right way they will be prophecy unto us so songs are not just songs music is not just mere music but the bride of jesus christ is in a state of worship brother branham said after the seals that everything would be worshipped so thou must prophesy son of man thou must prophesy again so let us worship well you can [Music] throw away [Music] oh take away the vision from these eyes that now who now can see [Music] [Music] and [Music] [Music] [Applause] but it's [Music] jesus [Applause] [Music] he said [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] tell who would me down his head and do this for me [Music] but then [Music] he put my name in his way and said [Music] [Music] never could [Music] [Applause] [Music] my [Music] of [Music] oh that [Music] [Applause] led those [Music] [Music] and said [Applause] [Music] hallelujah [Applause] [Music] go free god [Music] good reach down [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] but a man on [Applause] the cross he put me [Music] [Applause] [Music] blessed be the name of the lord we're free we're free we're free glory i was one time locked down in men's ideas of this message but i can say today that i'm free i've been free for a long time when somebody tries to put me in their little box and say this is only where god can move i said no sir i'm not going into your box because my god doesn't have us in a box he's he's taken us to the promised land and if the son has made us free we are free indeed not going back to that no sir we're going forward amen we can stay with all of our hearts this morning we are free people i say let them criticize they criticize because they don't have the freedom that you have here this morning hour let them criticize it really don't make no difference once you've been set free you're free [Music] [Applause] i feel a little bit like that man by the gate called beautiful when he got his his feet underneath him he started to run he had a reason to run he was bound in that condition for a long time but when he had freedom he exercised his ability of freedom when we've been released from what we've been released from i'm not going back to that old stuff no sir there ain't no life in it i want to be where god is and where god is there's life and he's moving and the power of his resurrection amen there should be a shout in our heart and a joy in our voice [Applause] glory hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord amen i feel good [Music] i hope you all feel good hope you all had a good rest last night and so good to be back in the house of the lord again hey why don't we just borrow our hearts in prayer just for a moment lord jesus we are here this morning our lord has a company of people we just sung this wonderful song i'm free lord to come out of just darkness lord to be set free lord there's something about it lord it just stirs my heart [Music] lord i thank you father for your grace you're the one lord that can pull the scales off lord you're the one lord that can give eyes to sea and ears to ear we thank you for it father it's a blessing lord to be here this assembly this morning our lord as we would share together in your word lord i pray father that you would meet every need of each person lord we confess we're needy lord and we need you father if there be any impediment lord we ask father do you forgive us lord of any thought or any deed lord may the blood of jesus christ cleanse us and lord we pray for brother ron one more time lord and we believeth all of our heart lord his enemy is his dead lord lord is just not walking into it lord strengthen him lord strengthen the people of this assembly lord and each one lord sister connie lord today be in mother's day lord strengthen all of our mothers lord have such a great job on their hands lord to lead their children in the things of god lord we honor them today not just today lord but every day so father be with our assembly back home lord as it would be gathering lord give them liberty lord may the holy spirit move amongst the lord but here this morning our lord as we would yield ourself lord soul body and spirit unto you i pray o god now that you would take full control of this service lord each person lord that would be here in the invisible audience lord may your grace reach out to everyone we committed to you now in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen god bless you you may have your seats this morning thank you for all the lovely music and all the wonderful songs and it's just an honor to be here with you again this morning have to excuse me for being a baby once in a while that's just part of my makeup and i don't apologize my all to it's just part of me amen is the lord been good to us david said it was he was glad when they said let's go into the house of the lord and i feel real happy this morning that we can be gathered together again and worship the lord all right so thankful we have spirit and truth amen it's just wonderful what the lord has done and is doing i'd like to say this morning as well to all of our mothers and grandmothers and to be mothers happy mother's day we honor you we thank you for your lives and sister mari here with me today as well i'm so thankful for that um this coming june uh we're we're going to be married 42 years and that's a real blessing a real blessing she's the one that makes sure i got the right color socks on so i don't got wrong color socks on or have things wrong that's not quite right or sometimes i put myself together and she straightens me out and says i don't think that quite looks good maybe for a circus or something but not not for church or anything like that but it keeps me straight and done a wonderful job of raising our two children and and now as a support for our grandchildren we thank god for our my wife and i know you do the same for your wife and our mothers back home were fortunate to still have our mothers my mother is 81 years old this year and and of course she's been on a journey and raised raised in the message myself and then she backslid for many years but god rich in mercy brought her back to the lord and she loves the lord with all of all of her heart she loves your pastor with all of her heart as well and sister connie and and myra's mom that she's 79 years old and and still strong and they're still still doing well and we thank god for it amen we honor you this morning amen and every day i always tell my my children every day is mother's day it's good to go give them a hug and let them know how much you love them amen because they've done a lot big sacrifice they're the fifth gospel they're the ones that taught the little ones to love jesus christ on their knee and so we're very thankful for that amen sister meyer myself will be traveling back home to canada in a few days we're just going to enjoy a little bit of the southern beauty and the things that you all have and we kind of enjoy it when we come down here i have to it's colder here than at home right now and i don't know what's going on with this weather thing i thought for sure we're going to have snow or something out there this morning but it sure felt like it and your humidity kind of bites you a little bit we're not too used to that we have more of a drier heat our dryer cold if you want to call it that when we're minus 20 celsius and you're close to the same we'd be feeling a lot warmer than you all i know it sounds very strange but it's just because it's a dry cold but it's good to be here anyhow we're not green yet where we are we're still coming to that part but springtime i love springtime because it speaks of resurrection time it's just a wonderful wonderful thing so we're going to be going for a couple of days with ron's sister connie and we enjoy doing that and we appreciate that and but if you ever have a moment in the lord ladies sister meyer myself and your hearts just say a little prayer for us that's one of the biggest compliments that you could give us is to breathe our name in prayer at some point so we certainly do would do appreciate that if we don't see you here on this side of glory look for us on the other side i'ma look a little different when i get on the other side but i remember one place where brother brown says when you go to shake someone's hand you're going to know their name at that moment i'm looking forward to that part because we'll know one another and i'll be looking for you you'd be looking for us and at that day it'll be such a grand day and it's not just going to be a short time we're going to have a thousand year honeymoon time i'm think of the couple that just got married and and they're one in their honeymoon of course it's a short time but you know the bible says when a man gets married to a woman he should take one year off of work that's kind of the scripture i i tell the young brothers at home but i i suppose the bible says you're supposed to comfort your wife i think that's a good idea but of course we don't get to do that but the lord's really going to give it to us he's going to give us a whole thousand years where we'll have a time together with the lord amen it's not going to be a wonderful wonderful time amen if you have your bibles this morning if we could if we want to stand for the reading of the word i'd like to read from romans chapter 15 today and and i'd like to actually start reading if we could from from verse 8 and then i'd like to move down to verse 13 and and pull up a bit of a text out of verse thirst 13. i was encouraged this morning one of the first songs that was sung in in the service this morning was i'm going in the rapture i'm going in the rapture before we read our scripture verse i'd like you to look at your neighbor and say i'm rapture material you look at the one beside you i'm raptured material what we are we're rapture material you say it don't look like a brother kelly we're rapture material i look at it that this is what god has has spoken this is what it is and we're going in the rapture amen we expect to be in there do we expect to be there amen then we're going to press forward with all that's within our heart amen let's just read this morning it says now i say that jesus christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of god to confirm the promises made unto the fathers and that the gentiles might glorify god it doesn't say that we're going to be sad and have and just said but he says we're going to glorify god for his mercy as it is written for this cause i will confess to thee among the gentiles and saying unto thy name and again he said rejoice let's rejoin let's say rejoice rejoice he gentiles with his people and again my praise the lord all you gentiles and lord him all you people and again isaiah saith there shall be a root of jesse and he that shall rise to reign among the gentiles in him shall the gentiles trust well there's only one person i trust that's him amen because the gentiles are going to trust in christ jesus which is the word now i'd like to take a text here and now the god of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing that you may abound in hope through the power of the holy ghost god bless you you may have your seats this morning that's incredible text that we just wrote read this morning that that paul had written and and i would say that it's something that that is settled within our heart we rejoice in what the work of calvary produced for us as a gentile people it is what actually puts us into the position of the bride being a part of him we come out of him at calvary now there's a few words here that i if you have your bible still open to romans 15 13 i'd like to just just highlight if i could for a moment it uses the word abound the word abound is an incredible word in the greek it means to it's it to me it refers to a flower that's going from a bud to full bloom one reason i love springtime is because the tulips start coming up around the house and the different flowers that that you planted maybe many many years ago but they're faithful every year they come up faithfully every year and you watch them come out of the ground and you can't watch them come into a bud position but in time of maturity that particular bud is going to come into a full bloom flower it really refers a lot to our personal walk with jesus christ we start with the lord and we start in our emphases and we move up into a position of a bud but it comes a time within our own christian walk with the lord where we actually start to bloom and come into a full maturity into a place where somebody can actually take the nectar from your life and give encouragement to their own life and and we can encourage one another because we finally moved to a place of maturity there's no other generation of time that could be in the position that we are except for you the people of the lord that's here this morning hour and by internet or wherever around the world because it's a time when the bride comes into a place of full let's say full full maturity amen we're no longer just a little girl i watch a little girls there's a wedding and you watch them afterwards they're they're still playing in the wedding and they're one day they're hoping to get into a place where where they will also be a bride but we can say we are the bride and we are prepared because we are now mature christians we're mature in the word of god and being immaturity in the word of god you know how to handle yourself now when you come into situations of life amen one thing they said about brother branham you couldn't tell his enemies from his friends i think that there can be said that about your life that nobody can tell your entities from your friends because you treat them all the same amen because it's in your heart that they also may have an opportunity to hear this grand gospel that you hear and to be able to come to the knowledge of the truth just like you did because in all honesty church if it had not been for the grace of almighty god many of us would not even be here today we'd be who knows where i would be here today i look at it all the time in ephesians chapter 2 by grace am i saved through faith amen it's a gift of god not of my own works but we we are all the workmanship of jesus christ amen because man inheritan himself would like to brag mannan himself has pride in his heart but when christ comes into our heart and we move into an area of maturity we no longer have to prove anything to the world we know who we are we are the bride of jesus christ we are the sons and daughters of god we are in a place of full maturity i kind of like that word because that word is abound and it means as we just indicated that we have come to a place of maturity another word i'd like to highlight is the word hope joyful and confident expectation of eternal salvation which is what hope means in the greek i say it one more time joyful and confident expectation of eternal salvation so we have a hope in our heart my hope i'm looking forward to going home but i'll be honest with you i'm looking forward to going home amen there's something about it where i don't have to worry about jet fuel won't have to worry about what the price of gasoline is going to be next week or the or the price of a two by four is going to be next week or gotta order a car maybe get it in three four years i don't have to worry about we don't want to worry about that no more we're going to a place where we don't need no gas we don't need no fuel we don't need no jet fuel we don't need no automobiles we're going to just travel like a thot amen so if you're all fellowshipping in the shenandoah valley on the other side i'm up in saskatchewan on the other side in a moment of time we'll be together again that's a hope we have in our heart that's eternal salvation not just something that's just temporary but something that is eternal because jesus came from eternity he went back to eternity and we were in him from the very beginning hallelujah i kind of like that i said this at home many times we got enough word right now we could close our bibles and go home my grandsons tell me you'd never let them out i said you're right another word which is which we've looked at and you know it very well there's the word power through the power of the holy ghost which is dunamis so each one of us must have the holy ghost you're not going to make it in the rapture without the holy ghost absolutely impossible you have to have the holy ghost it's not an option it's not one of those things where you when you buy a car you put an auction you have options you okay i want this option that option you're going to skip over the holy ghost loft no you must have the holy ghost in your life amen and we must have refillings in our life continually all the time amen when i drink water i'm happy to drink more water in in the next half an hour it's something that that you need for your physical body is something you need for your spiritual life is you need the holy ghost and you need to top it up all the time amen i don't like to run on the empty side i like to run on the full side amen because i want to make sure i have enough to make it through amen i hope that's okay today now this morning i'd like to my title if i would title it is keep pressing on keep pressing on if i would if i would want to use a subtitle to the thought this morning the subtitle would be there's better things ahead than any that you're going to leave behind there's better things ahead than anything that you're going to leave behind amen every day i'm leaving a lot of things behind i'm not going back to them but there's better things one of the better things is eternal life is a rapture amen i'm going toward the rapture amen last night we we took our texts and it was pull your sword for we're engaged in a battle and we're fighting a battle every day we i presented that statue to brother ron and that statue and i named it my enemy is dead amen because we believe that our enemies are dead it may be sickness it may be some besetting sin it might be something in our lives that that's holding us back but we're we want to declare to satan this morning that you're dead in my life and christ is alive in my life amen all of darkness is out of my heart all that's left in my heart now is light and that light is jesus christ amen now yesterday i was talking about i was saying that david's foot was on his mouth but it was actually his foot was on his eye and i want to make that correction this morning his foot was on his eye because goliath had a false light and goliath was was declaring by his idols and his god that his god was a greater god than what than what david's was but david declared that his god was the living god amen and when he died he put his foot right where it needed to be was right on his eyes so forgive me for that but i just missed the vision i just wanted to make sure i clarified this morning hour is his foot was on his eye amen and those eyes were a big old sausage like brother brown said they were and that's where it was the light was gone but david still had light in his eye amen there's one thing that is very very critical is that when you have light you have to you have no darkness and living in dark lady osea like we're living in we realize is the only light that's in the world is your life amen it's your life amen now when christ came into your heart as paul said in romans 7 21 he said when i would do good evil is present i'll tell you what the day you gave your heart to the lord is the day that that you started in a battle amen this battle that we're in is not for weak of heart people this battle that we're in is a battle that that you have to be prepared to fight every moment of every day because there's two spirits that's warring one spirit is good and one spirit is evil and good is trying to pull you to the scripture and evil is trying to pull you away from the scripture amen but i'm glad that the good is winning amen why is he winning because he won a calvary amen so the spirit of jesus christ in your life can never fail we may fail and we may fall short we may miss say certain words but god's word will never fail amen his word is eternal amen and just as his word is eternal we become eternal in his word i'm so thankful for the grace of god now we've heard in this in the message all of our life about the apache chief and that apache chief he he was filled with the holy ghost and and they came and talked to them and they said to him and they said how are you doing and he said well i'm doing pretty good and i'm doing pretty bad and they said he said since i received the holy ghost there's two dogs fighting in me we're all familiar with it but it bears repeating amen and he said that i've got a white one and a black one isn't amazing he definitely made a definition one was white and one was black amen and so they said they arguing all the time they growl and fight with one another and one wants me to do good and the other one wants me to do bad maybe you've never felt that way but i know in canada it kind of happens that way sometimes where where you you wanna you you wanna do this and it seems like something's there always to stop you amen well we learned that just the devil amen when we learn that we just look at it like the one man that brother brown talked about he woke up in the middle of the night and and he looked oh it's just the devil he went back to sleep see that's how we have to be about it it's just a devil you got no power over me amen because christ is within my heart i don't fear you anymore you're just a goliath to me and when the time comes i'm going to knock you down we have a witness this morning in the house amen he said well which one is when well we've heard it before and and it says well it depends on which one i'm feeding you know sometimes we feed it a lot with the things we shouldn't be feeding our souls with amen and i you know you say well you know he's going to go again on the internet and all the social media stuff yeah you know what bear's repeating because social media will not bring you to the rapture nor give you faith for the rapture it will not but i know that the word of god and listening to the message is going to give you what you have need of to make the rapture amen we have to remember what paul said lest i become a castaway amen we don't want to live our whole life and miss it at the last moment no we want to live our whole life and be going through it flying colors i i say i don't want the door hit me on the way in i want to make sure i'm all the way in all the time amen do you believe that this morning amen we we have to keep ourselves fortified we have to keep ourselves moving in a positive direction amen i say that let's fill our lives and fill our heart amen with praise and thanksgiving with the word of the lord and thank god continually day and night for what god has done amen the bible said lift up holy hands and praise and thanksgiving and prayer onto almighty god i believe that the lord loves the prayers of his people amen and the praises of his people no the greatest battle we have is within our mind in it and it's a daily battle we have good thoughts and then the next thing you know you got a negan of thought the next thing you know you've got a thought of fear amen the next thing you don't even know it comes also you've got a thought of peace over you amen the next thing you have thoughts of distress and you wonder where's all this coming from and then thoughts of anger i don't know if y'all have ever happened to you but i have to be honest and confess that sometimes can happen you got these thoughts of anger and then then also you have a thought of joy or a thought of doubt or a thought of faith amen and then we have thoughts which can impact relationship thoughts in our relationship that will make your marriage either positive or negative sometimes there's things that are just better left not said just don't say him amen sometimes there's things that are said and it's going to cause a big uproar i've been married 42 years i could kind of say a few things because i know where i've been at hey man there's sometimes you say oh i had somebody tell us back home one time i was doing some marriage and counseling and they looked at me said brother kelly you don't have a clue what we're doing what we're going through i said what are you talking about well you and sister meyer never had a fight in your life i started to laugh i said you're going to try to believe thank you actually believe that the man was older myself i said give your head a shake i said there what do you think for two people there's times that we do disagree if you want to just be honest with it amen and i know it's the same way with all of us if you're honest with yourself that's just how it is amen but there's something that keeps you together amen what keeps you together is the word of almighty god amen it's a love for one another amen what keeps your servant god it's a love for the word of god amen it keeps you in the hand of almighty god amen i want to keep myself in his palm at all time i never want him to take me out of his hands we have thoughts that would try to pull us from the orality of the word of god that's why people criticize i say literally there's got to be critics you can't get to the hall of fame without a critic amen let them criticize amen sometimes it doesn't feel good it's kind of sometimes the same people and no doubt maybe i'll get emails and things as well once they know what my email address is just don't give it up and they'll start sending me emails and texts and whatever but reality when you have something in your heart that is so important and so special amen which is christ crucified alive living in my heart amen and on the throne room i i i say it one more time you have something to be grateful about something to thank the lord about amen and i say i'm going to think on that thought amen and let the critics say what they may amen they can be ice cubes if they want to be they can be dead as a nail if they want to be they can be dried old wall flowers if they want to be it really don't make no difference to me amen but i'm going to a place where there's going to be a lot of noise there's going to be a lot of people i'm going to have a change in my body and i'm going to be honest i'm going to rejoice and i'm going to sing i'm going to shout i'm not going to get hoarse i'm not going to get tired i'm going to wring out the glories of god because we've got something to thank him for something to glorify his name for something to praise him about amen it's almighty god and what he's done for us hallelujah he's saved us he's healed us he's kept us in his hand he's keeping us to this day he'll keep us all the way through eternity hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord amen now satan doesn't attack you because you're weak he attacks you because you're strong let's say i'm strong i'm strong in the lord satan knows if he can get you to pull away from the word he's got you left amen so he's doing his best to distract you but we're not going to get distracted we're going to keep ourselves moving in the things of god keep moving higher and higher now i'm just going to preach like i preach at home if that's all right and the message perseverance he said now the devil is not like some people think he's mean and everything but he's deceitful the devil makes you think that you're right but when you disagree with the word that shows that isn't the spirit of god because the holy spirit wrote the bible and then it's got to be agreed agreeable with the word amen so it's good instruction to us if there's something in our heart that's disagreeing with the word then we must check ourselves to be sure we're in the word i'll just go a step further if you have the holy ghost in your heart you will check yourself with the word to be sure you're in the word and when you realize you're not in the word you're going to do something about it because you don't want to be wrong in the word because the word is where you have your protection that's why when people retract from the word and retract from from the message they go downhill very quickly because they have no longer any dis defense there's no boundaries amen the word gives us boundaries those boundaries aren't to do's and don'ts those boundaries our love boundaries those boundaries are put in place amen in order that we can go to a destination which is eternal life amen god set boundaries he said boundaries in israel he gives boundaries for us as believers i say thank you lord somebody told me one time i was i was in legalism i said seriously he said well you don't want to do this and you don't can't do that i say why in the world want to do that for there's nothing in my heart to do it and then they say well you're you're living you're living in a terrible place i said no i'm actually living in the best place because i know that when i'm in the word of god that it types abraham and israel when they were in the promised land when they were in the promised land god blessed him when you're in the promised word god blesses you amen i just accept his blessing i walk on it in the name of the lord we brought out yesterday we're in the second second corinthians chapter 10 verse 5 be it says bring every every thought into captivity to the obedience of god bring it to captivity every thought we looked at just one part in the passion translation that says we capture like prisoners of war every thought and insist that a bow in obedience to the anointed one in other words there's something we do we allow god to work in our lives in our life's journey we can lose sight that everything we have need of us in christ but as kings and priests chosen of god we must keep the holy ghost and fire kindled in the old testament there was one duty that the levites had to do and were kings and priests the levites were given an order and that order was that the fire of god would come down and consume the fast sacrifice it wasn't a man's fire well i don't want no man's fire i want the holy ghost to fire amen man's fire is a fire that is not a good fire we of course there's all types of that in the scripture but in the scripture it says when the when the lord came sent the fire down consumed the sacrifice there was something that the levites had to do and they were instructed to do every morning and every night it was their duty to be sure that fire would never go out amen i say in our lives it's our duty as believers it's pastoral for a moment here it's our duty as believers to never let let's say neverland never let the fire of god go out in your life amen that's why people can't rejoice because they have allowed the fire to go out they have a mental conception of the message but they have no life to back it up within their life amen why because the fire has gone out i say lord let the fire fall in this church this morning hour and consume everything that's in this church for the glory of almighty god let the fire of god fall upon every heart every individual we need the fire of god amen and how do we stoke the fire by the word of god we stoke the fire it continually starts to grow it does not diminish church it grows and grows and grows and consumes everything that's not of god it becomes a sweet smelling savor to almighty god now there's times we don't feel like praising the lord there's times i don't feel like preaching but i preach anyhow i hope that's okay i said that there's sometimes you don't feel like it sometimes you're a wish to the guy that's fishing the sunday morning when he maybe should have been in church i i think you maybe don't have any lakes close to all we have a lot of lakes but we preach anyhow we praise them anyhow why because we want to make sure the fire does not go out we got a kindle every morning every noon every every evening god knows your heart's desire he knows your burdens he knows your fears he knows your health conditions you say well pretty healthy you might get a doctor report in a week or two might be shocking news amen because god knows our health condition amen you might have a financial burden but god understands your situation i had somebody tell me one time he said you know what it's like to be without i said seriously i said i know what it's like to be without i know what it's like to not know when i'm gonna get my next dollar to pay my bills amen yeah the lord lets us go through a lot of things as people amen but it's only there for one reason just to drive us sometimes closer to god and to trust him more amen but god knows all of our needs let's say he knows my needs he knows them all and the bible says he'll deliver us out of them all amen he has an ability to do that you say well maybe i don't have a right job but he'll get the right job for you amen but you have to be faithful in that job and one place i'm going to just say this this morning i'm i'm i'm leaving leaving in a few moments here maybe an hour or two but there's something we have to be as faithful in tithes and offerings amen we don't realize the significance of it if we don't pay our tithes we're just nothing but a robber you say well i i'm a good christian you're not a good christian if you don't pay tithes and offerings i'm not pulling for anybody i'm pulled for the word of god the bible said he would he would rebuke the devourer but there's something you have to do first is have faith in god you say well i can't afford it i'll say this this morning you cannot afford it you have to pay it amen you if you don't pay it god will not rebuke the devourer i've seen people that have paid their tithes and offerings faithfully and sometimes people say well i paid them faithful for six months well it's like people they they want to make a prayer they go to a pot machine pop into the corner i guess whatever you guys pop in we popping loonies and toonies but you pop in dollar bills and and you get to pop in the bottom people expect prayer to be like that i prayed in the morning i expect something by the afternoon that's just not how it works amen sometimes you've got to wait a long time amen i i have asthma i still suffer a bit with respiratory illness but i waited 18 years for god to deliver me amen but i want to say he was right on time amen now when i look back at it i'm 60 years old and i look back at it at 39 years old god gave deliverance in my life and i can say this morning he is a healer because i've experienced it firsthand in my life and i can say this morning he is faithful to his word but you have to be faithful [Music] you have to be faithful amen the message love in 56 he said to think that perfect love casts out all fear you're not scared about nothing you're risk resting you're not oh i might backslide tomorrow i may backslide next week i wouldn't worry about that i'm not trying to hold on he held on for me and he put a love in my heart that holds there it's him holding me not not me holding him amen i'm glad i'm in his hand amen if it was me holding him i'd probably turn loose this brother branham but as long as he's holding me he will never turn loose let's say never this morning he will never turn loose let's say one more time never he will never turn loose he promised he wouldn't i'll never leave thee nor forsake thee he says amen and i say amen this morning because he's never going to lose one of his own they're in the palm of his hand i say church hold on be faithful he is faithful the least we can do is be faithful in the small things beyond the curtain of time brother brown was laying on his bed had his hands behind his head and he said i seem to hear the music and the words of an old familiar song he said i'm the homesick and blue i want to see jesus you say where the kelly what does this have to do is because whatever you're leaving behind there's something better ahead this is what's the better part he said i'd like to hear those harbor bells chime it would brighten my path and banish all fears lord look me pal let me look past the curtain of time amen i've mentioned yesterday i've got loved ones over there i can hardly wait to see them hey i know you have loved ones over there you can hardly wait to see them amen but one day church they're going to be knocking on your door hey man i look with anticipation for that day i i could be by tomorrow morning i don't know when it will be but it's going to be sometime soon amen the boy said would you like to look behind the curtain of time hey man he said that would help me so much amen because you have to remember here's a here's a prophet he said that he thought maybe brother neville would be on one cloud and he'd be on another cloud and he wouldn't be able to shake his hand and and and he would watch and say hey brother neville how are you doing he just flowed by he flew over here he didn't understand it but the lord showed himself i'm so glad he showed it to him amen because it strengthens my heart every day when i think about it amen there's such a grand homecoming time that's before the church of the living god i say this morning church don't miss it amen whatever you do don't miss it amen it's right before the church amen what did brother brown experience well you've heard it many times but i'm going to remind you again he experienced young men in the brilliance of their of their young manhood amen young woman with their hair hanging down to their waist with their eyes glistening like a star on a dark and night night he said their teeth were as white as pearls no matter it's no wonder that you go into a into a confession or into a drug store and you see all this toothpaste to make your teeth whiter buy this one and make your teeth whiter people put caps on it because they know in their heart there's a land that is better than this land amen but we are going to be the inheritor of that particular land amen god has put it in your heart and let you know that i'm part of the rapture i'm bride material i'm going to be in that land and there's going to be a day we're going to experience it when your eyes are going to glisten your teeth are going to be white as pearl hallelujah the voice just said to him he said you've just started but keep pressing the battle if you only knew what was at the end of the road that's where i got my inspiration from for this little thought here there's better things ahead than things that you're left behind there's better things ahead that's why we struggle that's why we press because we're pressing to a glorious place where there's no there's no death no sorrow where there's no evil where there's no suffering there's no struggling anymore it's just peace and joy amen can you imagine a place where there's only going to be peace and joy and happiness and exuberance and and just a love we're going to be out of this world of envy and jealousy and and malice and hatred and the more they talk about loving one another in this world the more they hate one another the more they try to put everything together the more it falls apart amen why because this is no continuing city you can build a new house today in 15 years you're putting a new roof on your house amen five years later you're putting new windows in your house why because nothing's continuing but when we get to the other side church amen it's going to be a glorious time you're going to plant something and you're going to be able to live off of what you planned you're going to build something and you're going to be able to inhabit it amen what a glorious land it's going to be church amen i say this morning one more time don't miss it whatever you do get perfect love in your heart amen we've got to get ready for this time for this land that god has promised to the church of the living god don't miss it if you've got something in your heart toward one another i say this morning in the name of the lord jesus christ get it out of your heart you cannot afford to miss a rapture because some heart feeling in your heart amen get it out of your heart the problem with people is they always want to point fingers at the next person when they should be looking at their own enemy which is themselves and deal with themselves people want to have envy and malice and pride hey man you can't want to talk to them they won't even talk to you claim to believe this message i say they're backslidden amen lacking the holy ghost in their life amen we need the holy ghost in our life to a full measure the holy ghost in your life will bring you to the word of god amen i believe that with all my heart brother branham taught that in the message amen the holy ghost brings us to the word of almighty god not away from the word of god amen hallelujah we need to get that in our hearts that's why the bible say pray for those that despitefully use you persecute you invisible union brother brown told us that we're going to a wedding in the sky and he said that that we already have we're already wearing the wedding band of predestinated unmerited favor he has already slipped it on your hands amen he said he put your name on a book he said what a thanksgiving hallelujah praise our god hey man can you imagine he just went like this with you and just put it right on your finger undeserving but he said i chose you to be part of my bride hey man i chose you with all your complexes with all your situation i chose you to be part of my bride amen all we can do is embrace him with all of our heart amen because god who's omnipotent omniscient on the present he's perfect in power and wisdom but he's eternal he knows the end from the beginning amen if he knew the end from the beginning that he knew us before the foundation of the world put your name in the lamb's book of life watch over your seed amen your parents and grandparents and all the way back until you're here in this hour because your birth is more supernatural than the literal birth of jesus christ amen because he did that all in one act but this comes through all of time and he put everything together in your life for this special moment here on the earth amen that made you a son and daughter of god somebody say praise the lord in this house amen for what jesus christ has done for you he's watched over you he said i've heard that a lot of times but has it ever sunk in your heart the bible says we're fearfully and wonderfully made we're the handwork we're the workmanship of jesus christ he put the exact right thing in your life for a certain purpose and for a certain reason i don't about you but that makes me get excited when i think about that about what god is doing and what he's done hey man it makes me thrills my heart you say this is very simple brother kelly that's okay if it's simple but is it in your heart amen that you believe with all your heart amen in your heart perfect love amen and let all the rest of it go aside amen because it really doesn't matter anyhow all that's going to be left is your character because brother brahm said we only take our character with us and that character is going to be tried in the fiery flame of affliction amen and each one of us are not exempt from it we we're all going to go through it but we're going to come through it with flying colors amen because there's a promise i'm not going to leave you nor forsake you i'm watching over you because you're etching the palm of my hand amen your name is in the lamb's book of life hallelujah he's predestinated us he decreed it from eternity god never stood and said i'll choose you not choose you but by foreknowledge he knew what what you would do with his word amen there's a deep calling to the deep amen it's god that started it and there's god that's going to conclude it amen in god's power to transform he said but brother there's one thing i can brag on i can brag on my lord jesus christ who has redeemed me and with his transforming power planted a seed by predestination and i saw it amen we saw it do you know that when a baby is learning to walk i don't know if i ever said this here before or not maybe i have i don't remember when a baby is going to get ready to walk there's something in him that tells him to walk we had one baby that had some situations and and you prayed for him and that baby walked brother williams baby he gave me the testimony on an incredible testimony what god did for that child and and for brother tim's grandson and so many things that god has done but it's inherent in the seed in a child when it's born that that child is going to walk you know i don't know who stood with a stopwatch or with a clicker but they say a child tries to walk 2 000 times up and down up and down we as parents say you can do it you can do it you're going to walk amen we watch that child stumble and fall sometimes what we are with our walk of the lord we stumble and fall but i'm going to tell you this morning you can do it because your bride material amen and that child will will drop and fall and crawl up on this thing they said i watched that video clip that brother william made and they had him crawling over the over the uh the uh coffee table and over the couch and and he was calling there he was just walking around i could see his smile on his face he was so happy about it amen you say well he wasn't walking yet but he potentially was in him to walk amen but there was going to come a time when he would walk not only walk but he'd run amen and that don't take very long once they get their feet under me well amen that's how we are we are bound we come to full maturity amen we're no longer just babes in christ but we can take the strong meat of the gospel amen put it in our heart ingest it and be able to reflect jesus christ in the power of his resurrection amen why because we come through the little stages to come to this other stage because there's a gene in you but if you have the gene of jesus christ in you you can't help what you are you can't go back to the world amen because something in you is driving you i would say until this morning you are driven in this hour to complete what's in your heart something is calling for you for eternity amen they say that edison he made a thousand unsuccessful attempts at inventing a light paul i'm glad we got lights i'm glad i don't live in luther's day where they had candles can you imagine all the candles that have to light every day and clean all the globes and things like that why we'd be busy i think that would be a brother job instead of a sister job so i'm glad they made lights wait we can make sure we can turn them on just flip the switch and and and they they and they said a reporter asked him how did it feel to fail a thousand times and edison replied i didn't fail a thousand times he said the light bulb was the invention of a thousand steps amen because it just depends on how you're going to look at it amen if you look at it in the lenses of what he was looking at it he didn't look at one of his things as a failure it was just one more move towards the right place amen on one day he got to the right place amen and we got there he flicked a light switch on i can just imagine he probably sat up all night long watching that light burn away haven what do we have today we have lights amen we don't even think about it we just flip a switch but somebody had to invent that light amen it took certain amount of steps now god had seven church ages amen he built his bride all the way up she fell down in the dark ages but i want to say that the bride of christ came up powerful through luther's age and powerful through wesley's age and powerful through this age until now we have a pride of jesus christ on the seat amen with power behind her and ability behind her she's the bride of jesus christ ready to rule and reign not just some little girl playing playing wedding or something like that we are now the sons of god we are now the bride of jesus christ we're getting ready to rule and reign for eternity hallelujah you may say i don't know if that's me brother kelly i want to say that it is you the pacific salmon one of the fishes we have on the on the pacific coast we'll probably eat in the restaurants and things like that salmons but they're pouring in rivers and streams up in the hills and mountains along the west coast of canada and from birth it moves out into the ocean and it goes out into the ocean and swims in schools of other salmon and for much of its adult life but after about eight years which is about the lifespan of the salmon it travels thousands of miles they say in the ocean i guess they put trackers on it so they understand that and it begins to fulfill feel a strong urge within itself that it has to go back to that stream where it actually had to go home amen back to its home amen and to a place where it would go and lay its eggs for the next generation and they say that journey it's a long journey back home but it's in it to get to the exact same spot where it was born at amen we were in the mind of god we're going back to the exact same spot that we should have been before the foundational world amen when the sons of god shouted for joy and i want to emphasize that they shouted for joy amen they weren't sitting back and with their arms crossed and criticizing they were shouting with joy for the glory of the lord amen for god fills the whole house and when god is in the room there's power in the room there's healing in the room there's deliverance in the room when god shows up because he's supernatural amen when he's around something's good is gonna happen hey man i say this morning something good is gonna happen something good is happening this morning amen it begins this long journey back home from the salt water back into the fresh water and it passes hundreds and thousands of inlets and streams in order to get there but the scientists they say that the fish has been endowed with a powerful sense of smell and enable it to detect the scent of water it was born and to distinguish it from all others i thought about that thought and i thought lord with all of the all of the the noise that's around us and all of the diversions that around us and all the the manipulating doctrines all around us there's something in the heart of the children of god that will not be caught in that and if they are in that they'll get deliverance from that that's why i'm not going into any more man's boxes anymore i've been delivered from that amen i'm free amen and there's something in it that that has the ability to detect the right place at the right time amen they say that one drop let's say one drop one drop of fresh water and eight million liters of salt water is all that fish needs to get it's bearing its gps set for the correct path to the journey home one drop of water and eight million liters of water i thought about that it kind of made my heart jump for joy amen because when something came upon the seed gene was in my heart it recognized immediately i am a son of god amen nothing can take that away from the bride we are already the sons of god amen i didn't know it when i was when i was lost and undone hey i grew up in church but i had to come to the knowledge of jesus christ amen when i came to that knowledge what joy it said in my heart amen i set my feet to jump and to set my feet to dance and amen why it was a joy of almighty god one glimpse of the glory of god is all it takes it drops upon your heart they say upon detecting that scent the fish is relentless to get back to the place that was born it'll swim uphill it'll go aggressive flow of water it'll go over obstacles and rocks and waterfall and predators it finally arrives the fish is beaten and battered and bruised but it will lay its eggs and die and thus continuing the cycle of life amen god has that inherit in that amen we may be battling bruised and we may may have scars in our life from situations amen but we're going to make it amen we're going to make it amen there's nothing can stop you from not making it hey man it don't matter what obstacle's in your way i'm going to make it hey man listen something inside of me says i'm going to make it i'm going to press through like i've never pressed before amen if i've been a little deletory or a little down in life i'm going to determine from this weekend on i'm going to press through amen i came a long way to tell you you're the bride of christ keep pressing the battle press through till you get to the finish line no time to stop right now it's time to press forward in the name of the lord amen go forward don't retract backwards there's no time to be going backwards hey man sometimes people they fall back and they lose their joy i say this morning take a hold of your joy amen sometimes you you just get down alone i say this morning take a hold of what god has given you this morning believe it take it in your heart hallelujah somebody say praise the lord brother brown talked about that little dude dew drop and he said he didn't know much about chemistry but he he said it must have been a congealing of humidity and atmosphere amen but when the night gets cold and dark and falls from heaven drops upon the ground amen in the fall it fell from somewhere hey man we came from somewhere amen i'm glad that i know where i came from this morning amen because wherever i came from i'm going back to amen just like that little dew drop as soon as the sun comes up it starts to shiver a bit and before you know it it just gets ahold and goes right back where it came from again amen if that could happen to a salmon if that could happen to a dew drop what about each and every one of us we're gonna go back to where we came from into the presence of almighty god live with him for eternity hallelujah blessed be excuse me i don't have covert either just a little bit of a cough nowadays have you oh that's the way it is back home anyhow you got to tell everybody i don't i call you cough i don't have covet did you test well i tested just a couple of days ago before i came here i had to get on the plane amen but one day we're going to be moved back into the presence of god amen because why because that's where we came from amen we're going through problems there's situations of life church but don't worry about those situations amen because one day we'll be drawn back to the place where we come from we come from god we're going to go back to god amen we're just going through this life as a testing ground and a place to be tried and tested amen but you're going to come out okay in the end amen why he's already got a picture taken from you before the foundation of the world he put in the father predestination amen he already saw you at your best 18 19 20 years old amen and we're walking right into that vision of what he's been foretold amen somebody should get happy this morning amen because you've got a prophecy over you that you're going back to what god saw you from before you're moving right into it day by day when you walk with the lord you move into that prophecy it's already been spoken it's going to happen i believe i'm going to be part of that by thoughts of grace amen keep pressing on speak to the rock brother let me say if you're not if you're walking in light having fellowship with god and his people and the holy spirit is upon you you must meet an obstacle right in the path of duty don't stop just keep pressing on god will make a way through it he said that's one of the greatest experiences of my life is to see god when i can't get over it get under it or get around it or any way god opens up a way and i go through it somehow or another his grace let's say his grace his grace is sufficient to carry us through it amen i say keep pressing on amen you may be struggling with sickness this morning you may be struggling in life this morning you may have struggled in your marriage this morning amen but i want to say there's somebody here that can help you this morning his name is jesus christ amen keep pressing the battle amen if we don't see you here we want to see you on the other side turn amen keep pressing take your position i am forgiven i am redeemed i am part of the bride of jesus christ keep moving forward there's a whole lot better things ahead than anything you're going to leave behind amen i'm looking forward to what's ahead brother andrew brother wrong brother william brother i i'm looking forward to what's ahead i am leaving a lot of baggage behind this is one trip where we unpack before we go maybe you got something unpacked this morning hour amen i say unpack it amen get yourself light in the lord and may the glory of the lord be upon you amen i'd like to sing a little song with sister meyer that's okay amen i always conscious of the time and things like that but i like to sing a song i want a song by the believers and
