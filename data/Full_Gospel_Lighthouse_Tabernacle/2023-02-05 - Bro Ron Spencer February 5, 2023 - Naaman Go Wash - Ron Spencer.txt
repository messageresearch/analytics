to church and had a heart attack and passed away this morning so it leaves a wife that is in the hospital and he's a pastor of a large Church there we want to remember them in prayer that God would be with them I spoke with him in a couple different meetings and sister Nancy he sat with us at a table brother Homer and a wonderful time there thank God there is a land beyond the river it's just a it's just a stepping stone to where we get ready to go and amen want to remember them in prayer Brother Andy said in on the stage with us this morning he's preparing to go to stem cell transplant this that will take place over the next few weeks and it's a very very difficult Journey that he's got to go through and I'm praying that the angel of the Lord would visit him on this stage and increase his faith and increase touch sister Wanda amen sister Linda we're praying for you the loss of your brother I know that's very difficult and God bless you we we're sure praying for you that God would touch your heart amen amen how many of you would have a need this morning that you just like to say Lord would you remember me remember me you may be like that little girl standing at the parade and the King goes by and all those thousands of people are are there and she's going and the King goes by she's standing crying in the little school teacher comes says why are you crying baby she said I was waving at the king but he didn't see me I want you to know you serve a God today when you wave at him he sees every everything aren't you glad of that aren't you so thankful that he sees you Lord Jesus how we feel your presence we love you this morning see our hearts desire we come here to get closer to you one day we'll spend eternity together but for now we're in this journey called time many of us has tremendous needs brother Randy standing here God you're a God rich in Mercy doctors are doing their best to extend his life trying to bring him back to a normalcy but there's a high position in this room [Music] that can do blood transplants in a moment [Music] Lord I just ask you that you touch him today the hands that went up went up Lord you know our names and our addresses no doubt it would if we were sitting in brother branham's meeting and he would call our name you sit in there if this would increase your faith call your name maybe tell you where you're from your condition what the doctor says then you would know that God knows we're a material audience we know that our lord Jesus knows everything about us now we just invite you to the Pew this evening that you touch our hearts come by and minister to us Lord as I stand here I need your help today I need your touch physically Lord I just pray that you would anoint this audience Lord and brother Gideon Lord he has crossed over to that which he has preached about for all of these years no doubt maybe his father was the first one that stood there for him to shake his hand and say welcome home now Lord Jesus I ask you to be with his wife be with his his audience that he has preached to all these years and labored I pray that you had strengthened them today Lord and now may we all look to you look to you that that today would be a stronger day with Jesus Christ if we don't know you Lord before the service is over may we come to know you more than a story more than a picture more than somebody else's testimony but now let it become ours in Jesus Christ's name we pray [Music] amen God bless you we certainly love you with all of our hearts it need good to us amen if you would turn with me to Second Kings chapter 5 and verse 1. second Kings chapter 5 and verse 1. amen brother Chris Sister Mary we're glad to have you back from your little time away and amen the son done you good yeah yeah only thing I have to say is to your next time invite me so it'd be a lot of miracles happen on that one but uh second Kings chapter 5 and verse 1. now Naaman captain of the host of the king of Syria was a great man with his master and honorable because by him the Lord had given Deliverance unto Syria he was also a mighty man in Valor but he was a leper you can be seated before brother Wendell Martin came and spoke to us it was on Wednesday of that week and I was on the treadmill in the morning and and I was doing my normal morning walk and I walk about two two and a half miles every morning on the treadmill and and uh I I it's just a good time for me to listen to sermons talk to the Lord pray I try to do it before anybody else gets up but I particular morning the Lord spoke to me and I say that with Incredible reverence the Lord spoke to me to speak what I spoke last Sunday and it didn't have to be that way the second part of that when he spoke to me he spoke to me to revisit and this was the words that he said revisit Naaman again so this morning we're we're fulfilling that part and so as we begin to look at it I I want you to just go Lord come to my Pew there's a reason that brother Branham brother Ron is having to speak this and so just just ask the Lord to come to your home and to your family and your situation maybe just an application to one person maybe even on the internet but but we're we're just asking the Lord to come by our way today now we understand that Naaman was a was a great man being a great man a great leader he was a war hero he had actually fulfilled a portion of Elijah's prophecy to which Ahab would be slain and he was a fulfillment of one of the Miracles that took place under Elijah now we would find that he would be a a portion of a miracle under Elisha now where it has importance to us today is is the spirit of Elijah it's the spirit of God five a different appearings of Elijah and we know that's Elijah Elisha John the Baptist and then our messenger brother Branham and then there's Elijah that is going to come back to the Jews and so we realize that it's God's spirit and so we we watch as Elisha is there and he is the prophet that is in the land and and no doubt is very notable and many people know about him and know that God is real and no doubt Naaman did not realize that he had fulfilled prophecy he had been a portion of a warrior that had fulfilled prophecy to which that that Elijah had spoke about when he became home no doubt there was celebrations that that Syria was set free and and and no doubt as he's raising in the ranks and he becomes into a position that he is in the king's Chambers very regularly he is there and and as he's there he's he's constantly in the secret rooms that are taking place and and this man is uh most notable he's he's kind of a man that would be known in his community as as one of those men that everybody looks up to but Naaman had a secret Naaman had a secret and being as dignified and as a much of a warrior hero that he was as much as he had fulfilled the plan of God in his situation he was carrying a secret it was a secret if it was known he would have been exiled he would have no longer been a war hero he would have no longer had access to the king the men that were around him would have never looked up to him his family would have had to Exile him and send him away and he would have lived a very horrible life can you imagine the difficulty of concealing leprosy leprosy is a disease to where your flesh rots it is a disease where your fingers and your arms fall off it is disease to where your muscles deteriorate and it comes it comes with great stench yeah yeah yeah can you imagine the difficulty of keeping this a secret he didn't want to go into exile so he had to hold this but while he was away in battle he had brought home a girl and this girl was in his home and she had came from the territory to where Ahab was killed her family was was great believers now she becomes a lady mistress in the home to help take care of the home and take care of the family she's a young girl and being a young girl she's now away from her family she's away from her home she's living in these incredible conditions no doubt no doubt Naaman was good to her no doubt whatever she needed he would give it to her but it wasn't home it wasn't a place to where that that she could feel comfortable to worship God this girl sitting in this home was a real believer though she be an alien from her community in her country she was a real believer let me just say if you've got the goods it'll live no matter what school that you're in no matter what job that you're on the Holy Ghost in America is the Holy Ghost in Africa the Holy Ghost in Switzerland it's the Holy Ghost everywhere you're at the message of the hour works here it works all over the world [Applause] oh it's the same message it's the same God it's the same Holy Ghost living inside of our lives no doubt she watched Naaman as he would close the door and begin to take his armor off you know your family realizes what you're going through he could hold it a secret to the world but he couldn't hold it a secret to his family and he would release the bandages and release the gauze from his body the stench would fill the room you can imagine what it was like cancer has a smell cancer has an odor that goes with it can you imagine much worse than that leprosy this is a miracle that Jesus will actually recall of Naamans being healed of leprosy maybe you don't have leprosy of the flesh today but leprosy of sin let pursue of bad habits secrets today you can have a phone full of pornography locked away from even family or a computer at home with that kind of nonsense sin can be so secretive but can be so destructive I I recall and I just want to just share a couple of things with you when brother Branham would have communion in his local assembly there in Jeffersonville before he would serve communion he would go around from house to house maybe not to everyone but he would go to house to house and tell them before you take communion get this right get this right and and maybe maybe you couldn't handle an individual like that but I would be grateful to God I'd be grateful to God that the prophet would come to me and say brother Ron would you get that right in your life I don't know anything in mind but but would you get that right in your life just get that taken care of because God sees it sometimes when you're hearing the preaching of the word and and you're thinking somebody told but it's a higher power that's coming down your Avenue and is coming to right where you're at and it's your opportunity it's your time to say God I want to get that right right now how long does it take just a moment father forgive me I'll never revisit that thing again in my life I'll not want that habit in my life but you could easily Rebel you could easily say that's none of your business you could easily say God I I I I don't want to do it do that but how close that we can come to the presence of God at our pride an evil spirit grab a hold of us and take us another way never to be remembered of any more literally pulled off of the scene two different instances that I would recall this morning wouldn't dare call names but in a prayer line there was a lady that was there had hair extremely long and she just said I I want the Holy Ghost she'd said in churches for years I want the holy ghost in my life Spirit of the Lord revealed to her that if you'll quit dating your boss if you'll quit dating your boss and wanting to leave your husband for that man and you'll make that right God will give you the Holy Ghost her pastor was standing right beside of me he would tell me he said I've been hurt I've been her pastor for decades and I didn't know it I said people can live a secret life it's not your fault Brother Ray you preached the truth all these years it's not your fault another place I was speaking and prayer line was taking place and a girl came and she was one in a deep experience with God and God spoke to her and said you're getting ready to commit suicide and you're dating a married man and you borrowed his gun to commit suicide with she just fell in the floor you see no man notes that but God knows that's watching over our lives for both of those individuals it was an extension of life for them are you with me now I don't know the end of the story but I don't know what they will do with that in the end that's not mine to do but I know a God that can change your life this day this service yeah in this very moment he can change your life this man being a a public figure a man of great stature goes home and his family knows all about the secret that he's carrying they know no doubt they have great respect for him but they know what's going on and he comes in and he unwraps and that little girl sees him in that condition now she though she be an alien in another country though she be under captivity though she being a servant to this man she could have withheld Mercy she could have just said good enough for him good enough for him he's taken me captive good enough for him let him die let him rot let him just go away but there was something greater about the message of the hour that she had talked in her heart she said there's a prophet in our land in my home country his name is Elisha and if you could get to him God could heal you of that dreadic disease now I want you to understand no person had ever been healed of leprosy to that point not one not under Elijah not under Elisha but this little girl believed the principle of God all things are possible and under that all things are possible leprosy is possible first stage cancer is possible restoring marriages is possible overcoming every devil in hell is possible when the devil tells you it's impossible I want you to know our God takes care of the impossibility foreign [Applause] how do I get to such a man go see him go see him Naaman writes her letter to the king because he knows that his presence in that country who will call for war can you imagine that him coming as a Victor over you now you've come back what are you doing here so Naaman does like a lot of church members do I'll do it my way whether you know this or not in the satanic world the number one song that they use is I Did It My Way it's always been that way Lucifer did it his way your enemy is your own self-will so you wrestle with your own self-will my way if I'm going to be healed I want to do it my way so he gets granted permission from the King to go see the king of Israel and when he goes to see the king there even that King riches close in the presence of Nema what's he doing here is there a war getting ready to take place he thinks that no doubt the king will call for Elisha to come well let me just remind you something about the spirit of Elijah they're not politicians brother Brandon was not politically correct either but if we could go back further than that Jesus wasn't politically correct sometimes we say difficult things from the pulpit and people go well brother Ron that's kind of a hate speech kind of thing have you read John 8 have you read John chapter 8 where Jesus calls them devils Beelzebub you're of your father the devil the highest men of all the churches he calls them devils he was not a politician and let me just say when we're screaming out come out of this those denominations let me just say it we're not doing that in hate we're doing that in life we don't want to see people go to the tribulation period we don't want to see them because the scripture says come out of her be not a partaker of her place sure I've got great friends there I got great buddies in those systems it's not the people it's the spirit of the system [Music] and the system has told God we don't need you [Music] very weird foreign shows up and he takes his Caravan and takes all of his money and his jewelries and takes his talents of silver you know because Elisha wouldn't come to the king's chamber that wasn't in his agenda one of the double portion Miracles is on its way amen when Elisha was a following Elijah Elijah asked him said what do you desire of me he said I want a double portion of what you have a double portion twice as many miracles as what you have now one of those double portions is on the way but Elisha is alone isolated with God sometimes we want preachers to be the guy that patched the babies and hugs everybody and shakes everybody's hands and tell them how much they love them they want a buddy for they don't really want a pastor they want a buddy [Music] brother Birmingham said you got to be a man that's isolated to God and and just like brother Branham had to go to Arizona because the vision commanded him to go to Arizona and he would be there and and they would be picking a cocklebur off he was there when the seals were revealed he was in an isolated condition to where God could speak to him and then he would come back let me just say it wouldn't be just one miracle but God was going to open the entire Bible to the Bride of Jesus Christ and now she would be known as people of an open book and let me just explain this to you when you're thinking about this this may be very Elementary but there's schools all over the world of schools of theology Great Wall structures of Theology and they've been there for hundreds of years but they couldn't open this book but God sent Elijah the prophet to you and listen no better to open the book than the author of the book and when he begins to speak through the vessel it was more than the voice of William Branham but it was the voice of Jesus Christ now that voice is thundering in the bride not just in the ministry but in you [Applause] Elijah Elijah's hid away and when they come to the house you can imagine you can imagine Naaman felt like you know he was somebody this prophet he'll come out and maybe bow at my feet profit will provide a great feast maybe he'll do a lot of things he had probably a lot of false illusions Elisha didn't even come out now wouldn't you be mad you've made this journey and that prophet wouldn't even come out [Music] he wouldn't come out to see him I'm dying here I'm rotten away I'm the one that that fulfilled the prophecy look who I am he wasn't interested in who he was his political stature didn't bother him none whatsoever the Hazel went back in and told him no doubt what law was going on and he said tell him to go wash go wash in the muddy river of Jordan go down there wash and don't just dip one time but you dip seven times now listen when gehaza goes out and gives him this news he

god with everything in your heart you got to do some washing and you got to go deep in that Jordan seven times you gotta dip [Music] you can't do it the easy way shaking a preacher's hand signing a book somewhere another making a vow I'm gonna be better in my life I'm preaching to a lot of people right here so many people want an easy way they want an easy way into their Kingdom they want to substitute there's nothing that will substitute a new birth experience where you die to yourself thank you God so fills you till you get the Holy Ghost you may wallow on this floor rolling over and over again skip the dignity out of our Lives let us get the shame out of our Lives let's get the embarrassment out of our lives [Applause] secrets to live in homes there was a man came here and he made fun of our worship on Saturday night we had a Jericho March we shouted we danced brother Homer the first edition of Homer was singing and shouting holding his ear and this man grabbed his family and they walked out we had a scheduled dinner the next day to with this fella I'd known him for years and he said you know why last night I just didn't just didn't appreciate what went on he said I don't think we as Christians ought to have to do that he said it grieved my heart when I saw people dancing you know he had forgot to quote where brother Brown said a man came to him and said when that sister started shouting and praising the Lord he said if six heels all over me brother's response to that was you better not go to heaven you'll freeze to death I got a hundred quotes that goes with that and as I was sitting across the table from that man brother Homer sitting right beside of me and I just leaned across to him and I called his name and I said the reason that you have difficulty with that is on Tuesday you were looking at pornography and you got it cut off just in time before your wife walked into the room that's why you had difficulty with our Shout now those on the internet may have difficulty with our Shout it's because they're carrying a secret [Applause] maybe their their church has classes to overcome alcoholism or classes to overcome pornography let me just say this to you there's only one kayak class that I believe in and that's a prayer meeting where you start that prayer out at father forgive me [Music] and then you begin to expose yourself before God and you say God I can't live as a slave no longer to this sin [Music] I don't want to Harbor this and hold this in my life no longer brother on but I was abused as a child don't blame this or that you don't have to live in that prison house no longer you're not a slave to that thing anymore I'm sorry that you were abused and I'd be the first one to put an abuser in jail I'd be that first one [Music] hell will not be hot enough for somebody that abuses our children [Applause] I think they ought to arrest every one of these people that go to on these websites to try to for child pornography I think they ought to put them in prison and keep them there [Applause] thank you let me tell you something about pornography you're looking at somebody else's wife you're looking at somebody else's husband let me tell you about that no doubt it's been digitized and transformed to where it looks like a model look at them down the Rope when they're 90 years old and hell's waiting on them there ain't nothing good about Sin let me tell you men let me just say I don't care what a woman begins to try to come at you there's nobody better for you than your wife [Applause] [Music] you might as well start shouting and he's praising the Lord right now oh my brother Ron my wife now got humps and Bob's look at my mirror hot dog [Applause] foreign your bedroom's to be holy it's to be a place where you enjoy your wife sometimes I'm I'm just might as well preach we walk up and say God take all the lusts out of my life no God just needs to channel your lust [Music] lust Channel your lust and you and you have relationship with your wife it'll take care of that [Applause] what are you doing I'm getting rid of leprosy [Music] [Applause] brother I just gamble I just gamble once in a while I just gamble and you know one day I may win a million dollars really have you read any of the stories of the people that actually won how it destroyed their lives nobody knows except for the person at 7-Eleven or Kings or one of those places you know it's just five dollars then the same devil will tell you don't pay tithes [Applause] I don't know why I'm revisiting that but let me let me just share something with you we get so tore up when our 401k all of a sudden starts falling we change administrations and all of a sudden it's worth 50 of what it was worth I'll tell you how much is in my 401k I'm gonna be really honest today 10 462 dollars I've had it in there since I was 36 years old I am not banking on my 401k it has reached 20 000 before it has went back to seven thousand and now it resides at ten thousand [Laughter] I was talked into it by a tax accountant to do that to give me a break on my taxes and when I realized that there was a better place to put my money okay you've asked for it several of you've asked me how do I be successful okay it's not putting your money in the stock market go get me one of those Trace everybody gets the Jitters when you do this but no I'm not going to take up another [Laughter] [Applause] yeah we're going in Washington so we might as well wash brother Ron how do I be successful so you take 10 percent of what you earn the first fruits which goes back to God and God has told you that he's going to seal a covenant with you he will make your 90 go further than your 100. now I think they just raised the interest rate to four point somebody help me on your borrowing 4.35 or something like that and you can get interest now I know you can get interest on a CD at 4.5 because I did check on that the other day I didn't know I was preaching on it but now I got a solid figure nobody call me tell me where I got that but I'm ever amazed I take your tithes home now I'm going to tell you an inside secret I take your ties home and we pray over them here but I as your pastor or or a type of a high priest take your blessings that God has blessed you to work with and I take them and that's God's money it ain't mine I don't buy a car on your money I didn't build my house on your money I I didn't do that but I take the word of God and pronounce a blessing on you isn't that right I pronounce a blessing on you it's my job to take God's word and pronounce a blessing on you now here's where God comes in and he starts blessing your job he starts blessing your home he Sparks blessing every Avenue of your life he starts blessing your children [Music] but where the devil begins to rob you is are you with me now that preacher don't need that that church don't need that it ain't the churches it ain't the preachers it's got [Applause] [Music] [Applause] foreign [Applause] so sometimes we've got to wash ourself as a man came to my father and was going to give him a large sum of money my dad needed it he needed it it was eight of us in the church eight and this man came to give him a large sum of money and he said Charlie this is what I want you to do with it my daddy was a real man he was a man from his feet to his head and they said you keep that money you keep that money because that money ain't my money it's God's money and you don't have a rope on your tithes [Music] you want another story brother Homer was down and me and him was working on those those doors remember those old doors those locks were horrible and brother Homer was now working on those locks and he was working and a guy walks by him and he said brother Homer I want you to pray for me that I can go buy myself a new truck brother Homer didn't even take a deep breath he said you won't be able to handle it because you can't pay your own paths [Applause] man bought the truck lost the truck in a few months it was gone Peter just paid attention to the pastor you know the pastor just simply told him the truth sometimes we want to go to 14 different people to get what we want to hear [Applause] if we can't get the right answer from brother Ron we'll go to brother Donnie or go to brother Tim or go to Jason Jackson go to Joe Greene we'll we're going to go to somebody that'll finally give us the right answer God's always got the right answer [Applause] so now I've just exposed to you for you young people of The Secret of success in your financial matters you don't have to go to a six weeks class where there will be a contest at the end of it I'll make it simple for you a dime is tithes on a dollar and if you start with a dime then when it get turns into ten dollars you give a dollar and then God watches you Faithfully at one dollar and then it's ten dollars and then it's a hundred dollars and then it's a thousand dollars and then it's ten thousand ten percent is ten percent Andrew you're my partner in all of this that's what I've did and practiced all my life and I give away more than 10 percent of my own I don't want to go washing that River it's nasty the last time you guys were there didn't that River stink if I go to that church people are going to make fun they're going to get on the internet and say it and people shout that's a little wow I've got some wild Services hey young buck gets up there and sings and dances and preaches and now you know man they obviously didn't go to school let me tell you something about dignity I was preaching a convention and it was a guy came in his shorts his golf polo and his funny looking hat his wife was a real believer so after church and after our meeting took place they had a dinner guess who I got to sit right across the table from this man was a top elected government official top he said in the parliaments of his government but I had what he needed I said Across From Him Sister Alyssa I didn't know nothing about his government I didn't know how they operated I didn't talk to him about his golf game do you know what I talked to him about Zacchaeus Zacchaeus had a wife that was a believer and she talks so much about Jesus until he wanted to see what was going on that's exactly where he was at and I talked to him about how that brother Branham said they got over there and he couldn't get in the tree so he turned Garbage Pail upside down and he got up in and it fell down in the garbage he got garbage all over him and he got up in the tree and the guy kind of just looked at me because he never heard a sermon like this and I told him all about zacchus and then Jesus under the tree he wasn't worried about his profession or even his position in life he said Zacchaeus I want to have dinner with you he didn't teach him about third pool he didn't teach him about he was God he went to his house and his atmosphere change zacchus's life and zacchus went and redistributed all that he had taken he became a different man after he met Jesus that's what happened at that table if I can look past your dignity and all you're put on and tell you that you need Jesus [Applause] and if you can get past from your side all of your put on and all your dignity and all your honor and I'm all this and you can realize you're rotten flesh stinks brother berms says you we said those little girls going down the street he said within 24 hours worms could be crawling through her body so that Purdy flesh actually stinks Naaman finally come to the place I can't live with this no more but if this is the answer and he started pulling off his and now what he had talked about everybody saw it brother Timothy now all of the men that had served him looked at his rotten flesh they'd never seen it before now they could smell it and now he was just taking it off and he waited out in that muddy stinking River and he dipped once and it was still there he dipped again and it was still there you may have to go to the altar more than one time but you got to fight it out either sin or reign in your life or you're going to fight it out in the champion of our life will come and live God don't live in a halfway house [Music] [Applause] sin and the sin and God don't live together Sims Gotta Die and brother Chris he dipped seven times and on his seventh time up one of Elijah's Miracles one of the double portions happened in a moment's notice it was over his nightmare was over [Applause] you talking about shouting you talk about shouting I don't give you a bad illusion but I would imagine there was a naked Naaman that had the best looking skin that was in the land dancing all up and down that Jordan I'm Healed I'm Healed I'm Healed I'm Healed I'm Healed I'm not dying no more I'm not rotten no more I'm not stinking no more that's what we need here there's some people to start just shouting and running up and down your experience it's all about [Applause] just as Jesus had men to come back to thank him for what he had done Naaman went back to Elisha this time Elisha came out I want you to just notice this time Elisha came out and he wanted to thank him he wanted to thank him in so much he wanted to give all the gifts and give it to him no doubt Elisha lived in one of the smallest houses that there was you'd have never picked that as a prophet's house he wanted to give him all those gifts I don't want you I don't want to I don't want it you can't buy miracles you can't buy your salvation I talked to you about ties but you can't just because you pay tiers you still got to be born again you got to be born again you can't bypass that you got to go to the muddy Jordan yourself you can't send a friend to do it for you you can't send a pastor to do it for you you got to do it yourself you got to do it [Music] but what would you want from me he said I want I want some barrels of dirt our dirt yeah I've got to go back home but your God don't live at my house the blessings are here so I want to take your God that has healed me to my house this a preach there's a preach right here what lives in this building God wants to go to your house you say my brother Ryan I live in an impossible situation have I not told you before that all things are possible to them that believe my wife will never serve God are you are you are you putting breaks on God my husband will never serve God [Applause] sorry a sister was going to brother branham's meetings and she was telling her husband when the brother Brandon says the angel is here I can see it when he says the pillar fire is right over there she said I can see it I'm nobody spiritual but I can see it and she tells him a couple of nights and finally he says I'm gonna go foreign and so he goes now God's got a sense of humor he's got a way don't you try to fix it God's Got a Way they ask that man to Usher brother Brian from the car to the pulpit a lot of guys watching brother Brown's Buddies but God had it that this critic would be the Usher for brother Branham to go to the pulpit and he's standing there with a lot of thoughts in his mind of what brother random would be like and he said when brother Branham got out of the car he said he stood there and talked to him like he had known him all of his life and said they talked his people was kind of pushing their way and said brother Brandon just talked to him you know they was going toward the door and he said when brother Brown got to the door he pulled his hat off and he said would you mind holding my hat while I preach and he said I stood there and I'm being a Critic are now in the position of holding his hat while he preached do you know before the service was over that man was a believer how do you know that sir that story so well that man came to this church down on the the drive what was Summit many times and told us that story several times and he said what clinched the nail he said there was a lady come across the prayer line that and brother random told her her name and he said that was right and he and he told her her address and he said nope that ain't right so he put himself in position when she came off of the platform he told you your name and that was right but then he told you your address and that wasn't right she said we moved yesterday [Applause] so maybe you need to get a big bucket today fill it with dirt fill it with all the love of God just keep pouring in and put it up on your your mule and and start taking it home I'm taking God back to my house not a leper no more I want my family to know the god that has healed man the god that has made away from me I want them to know my God he was a Licious God he was those people's God but he's my God now Give the Lord a great big hand let's stand to our feet [Applause] maybe you'd just like to Bow your head just a moment I'd like to talk to you maybe you're on the internet and
