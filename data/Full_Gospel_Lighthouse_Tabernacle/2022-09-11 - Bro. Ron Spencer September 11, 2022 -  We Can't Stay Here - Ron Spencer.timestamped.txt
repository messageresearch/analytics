[42:29] for our 50th anniversary for coming
[42:32] through the fire for those that don't
[42:34] know
[42:35] we were just hours we had been in a coma
[42:37] almost a month
[42:39] and uh lungs were burned and face and
[42:42] arms were burned but they were getting
[42:44] ready to harvest my organs in about five
[42:46] more hours
[42:48] and uh brother tim pruitt preached two
[42:51] sermons on god's hall of fame
[42:53] thankfully i was in it
[42:55] and the second one i or the i don't know
[42:57] the exact chronological order but the
[42:59] other one was god will have a testimony
[43:02] and for 15 years
[43:05] we've had a testimony and so we thank
[43:07] the lord for that
[43:18] had not those lungs healed they could
[43:21] have never sustained the cancer that is
[43:24] in them so
[43:25] so they always tell me that your lungs

[47:12] amen
[47:18] amen
[47:25] now this is paul after he has
[47:27] just preached the sermon
[47:31] and now this is in conjunction because
[47:33] notice
[47:34] notice it says but
[47:36] so the thought is not finished
[47:39] so he's talked about rapture
[47:41] and the sequences of rapture
[47:44] but now
[47:45] he's going to talk to us about things
[47:47] that we must be very much aware of
[47:50] this is for believers this is for
[47:52] believers now
[47:54] but of the times and seasons
[47:57] brethren you have no need that i write
[47:59] unto you
[48:01] for yourselves know perfectly
[48:04] that the day of the lord so cometh as a
[48:07] thief
[48:08] in the night
[48:10] for when they say i shall say peace and
[48:12] safety
[48:14] then sudden destruction cometh upon them
[48:17] as travaileth upon a woman with a child
[48:20] and they shall not escape
[48:24] but ye brethren are not in darkness
[48:28] that that day should overtook you as a
[48:31] thief
[48:32] you're the children of the light
[48:34] and children of the day
[48:36] we are not of the night
[48:38] nor of the darkness
[48:40] therefore let us not sleep as do others
[48:43] but let us watch and be sober
[48:46] for they that sleep
[48:48] sleep in the night and they that are
[48:51] drunken
[48:52] are drunken in the not but let us who
[48:55] are of the day be sober putting on the
[48:58] breastplate of faith and love
[49:01] and for a helmet in the hope of
[49:03] salvation for god hath not appointed us
[49:06] to wrath
[49:08] but to obtain salvation
[49:11] by our lord jesus christ
[49:14] who died for us that whether we wake or
[49:18] sleep
[49:19] we should live together with him
[49:22] wherefore comfort yourselves together
[49:25] and edify one another even
[49:28] also
[49:29] ye
[49:30] do
[49:31] amen let's pray lord jesus we love you
[49:33] this morning
[49:35] wow what a wonderful time to be in the
[49:37] house of the lord
[49:39] why in laodicea people are going in
[49:42] every direction and hearing every kind
[49:45] of a voice
[49:46] thank god that we have an ear to hear
[49:49] and it's been tuned in to hear the voice
[49:51] of the lord
[49:52] to prepare us for our going home
[49:55] i asked you today that you would bless
[49:57] people's hearts touch them today both
[50:00] here and invisible we ask you that you
[50:02] would anoint us together anoint the
[50:05] speaker
[50:06] lord you see our circumstances of life
[50:08] and i ask you to bring strength to us
[50:11] today lord not only the speaker but also
[50:14] the hearer we pray that you would
[50:16] minister to every need
[50:19] those that need a baptism of the holy
[50:21] ghost as we heard the prophet coming
[50:24] down the road sister you're you're
[50:26] desiring the holy ghost
[50:29] this sister here has desired the holy
[50:31] ghost that brother he's desiring the
[50:33] holy ghost why all of us are desiring
[50:36] more of you tonight father i ask you
[50:39] today that you'd speak to our hearts and
[50:42] feel us like never before
[50:44] may it be a refeeling of your presence
[50:47] and an anointing of god
[50:49] may the angels of god just sweep through
[50:52] this building
[50:53] may demons be thwarted at bay and pushed
[50:57] out of this place
[50:58] in jesus christ's name we pray amen and
[51:01] amen and amen you may be seated
[51:08] me it's not kobe
[51:16] my thought this morning is we can't stay
[51:19] here
[51:23] it doesn't take a very spiritual man to
[51:26] know that this world is falling apart
[51:29] this world is in a collision course with
[51:31] the tribulation period
[51:34] where brother branham would use the term
[51:36] love would leave the earth when the
[51:38] bride of christ would be taken off of
[51:40] the sea
[51:41] all that would be saved in the gentile
[51:44] dispensation is saved on this side of
[51:46] the rapture
[51:47] so get your loved ones in
[51:53] get your loved ones in get them get them
[51:55] in it's it's more important than
[51:57] anything that's going on in washington
[52:00] get your loved ones to the foot of the
[52:02] crowd across it to know jesus
[52:06] that that at least that jesus will hold
[52:09] them throughout the horror
[52:11] of the tribulation period what's going
[52:14] on in ukraine
[52:16] or at the holocaust
[52:18] brother branham would use this term
[52:20] would be like a sunday afternoon picnic
[52:24] compared to what the tribulation has in
[52:27] store for it
[52:28] remember who is in charge of the
[52:30] tribulation period
[52:34] we heard about king jesus last night
[52:38] but king satan is going to be given a
[52:40] little little opportunity on the earth
[52:43] and he is going to unleash his powers
[52:47] remember his his triumph his triumphant
[52:50] trinity is kill steal and destroy
[52:55] satan is not your friend he is not
[52:58] nobody to negotiate with
[53:00] he will make you many offers in your
[53:03] life
[53:04] never take up one of them
[53:09] last week we last week we had phenomenal
[53:12] meetings
[53:14] and in those phenomenal meetings we
[53:16] heard such powerful thoughts it was god
[53:18] speaking to us
[53:20] through ministry one more time
[53:22] to hear the voice of the lord
[53:25] brother timothy pruitt spoke on friday
[53:28] night and
[53:29] he may be his father's son and maybe an
[53:32] associate speaker there but he's a
[53:34] convention speaker in his own
[53:37] he don't have to let nobody hold his
[53:39] briefcase for him he's a powerful
[53:41] speaker but there was a thought that
[53:43] just kept resonating in my heart
[53:46] and he said as we are astronauts and
[53:49] they're sitting on top of those
[53:51] incredible tons of energies that were
[53:54] below them
[53:56] men have died because of those things
[53:58] blowing up
[53:59] but they're trusting in their training
[54:02] they're trusting in their vision they're
[54:05] trusting in the mechanics and he said as
[54:08] they're leaving the earth they're not
[54:10] worried about what's going on down here
[54:15] their focus is on there
[54:18] maybe they might be there and they're
[54:20] circling the earth and look at the earth
[54:22] from that sphere they're not worried
[54:24] about the light bill they're not worried
[54:27] about their dog being fed they've left
[54:29] it
[54:33] and as our vision begins to change
[54:35] toward
[54:36] heaven the lest this world's gravity has
[54:41] a hulk of our lives
[54:43] remember enoch began to walk with god
[54:47] and the more that he walked with god the
[54:50] less
[54:51] this world meant to him
[54:54] that don't mean jobs are not important
[54:56] that don't mean education's not
[54:58] important your home is not important
[55:00] that don't mean that we live like a
[55:02] bunch of vacant bonds
[55:04] [Music]
[55:05] but this world is not our home
[55:08] [Applause]
[55:18] brother tim spoke to us on investigating
[55:21] angels
[55:23] the week before he had spoke on
[55:25] entertaining angels
[55:29] that was a great message too you can go
[55:30] listen to that
[55:32] but remember those angels are here
[55:34] investigating
[55:36] brother branham would point it out and i
[55:38] and i just want to brother branham would
[55:39] point out those ufos that they were
[55:42] investigating angels that were on the
[55:44] earth
[55:45] our governments has denied the sightings
[55:48] of those
[55:49] but but let me just say this to you
[55:51] they're not just
[55:52] reporting on sodom and gomorrah but
[55:55] they're reporting that there is a bribe
[56:01] that has assembled herself
[56:03] not just a bride from america but from
[56:06] around the world
[56:08] we have been gathered and we're not some
[56:10] immature
[56:12] girlfriend but we are a mature lady now
[56:16] that the wedding gown
[56:18] fit perfectly
[56:23] we're an impres we're an impregnated
[56:26] bride bringing forth jesus christ
[56:29] as a matter of fact we can term it like
[56:31] this we are the bride's coming of jesus
[56:35] christ
[56:40] hallelujah
[56:42] under the bride's coming and under that
[56:45] seven angels appeared in in arizona
[56:50] we're a people worthy
[56:52] to hear that word
[56:55] will people that can handle the word
[56:58] we're not denominational feeders
[57:01] as we heard last night
[57:04] we are very if we we were in a chicken
[57:08] yard
[57:10] but we couldn't stay there
[57:14] because redemption is coming out but
[57:17] it's also going in
[57:19] and so we must understand that we are
[57:22] worthy by the blood of the lamb
[57:26] and this was not william branham's
[57:28] message but that was the who he came
[57:30] through but it's the message of the lamb
[57:34] and he slipped the wedding band of
[57:38] a predestinated unmerited grace
[57:41] on our finger before the foundation of
[57:44] the world
[57:48] amen
[57:49] so we're feeding on the mighty angel
[57:52] that's here
[57:53] we heard brother donny reagan come and
[57:55] he spoke
[57:57] and we certainly enjoyed blowing up dams
[58:02] unplugging
[58:03] the the pipes
[58:09] we sure enjoyed
[58:11] that when that we have been told as
[58:14] ministers
[58:15] that we're we're not beaver dam
[58:17] preachers
[58:19] and you know in this church we're not
[58:21] going to damn up your worship
[58:23] [Applause]
[58:30] and i've always wanted it to be that if
[58:32] brother branham would come back on the
[58:34] scene
[58:35] and if he could stand here and preach i
[58:38] would like for him to be very
[58:39] comfortable
[58:43] to address he never got the opportunity
[58:45] to address a message church i'd like for
[58:47] him to be very comfortable
[58:50] to address this portion of the bride of
[58:53] jesus christ
[58:54] and i could like to be able to say
[58:56] brother branham you could preach
[58:57] anything you want to hear that you
[59:00] preached we believe it all
[59:11] amen
[59:12] if you have an uncomfortable level of
[59:14] certain things that's being preached you
[59:16] just go need to get that right with god
[59:20] don't miss the rapture with that
[59:33] there was a story that was told
[59:36] i'm going to tell you two stories
[59:38] that was told one was told by brother
[59:40] branham
[59:42] one was told by spurgeon
[59:47] there was a man that was a gold digger
[59:51] and he and he tried to find gold
[59:54] it spent his life trying to get it
[59:57] gold and
[59:58] something was driving him
[1:00:00] became older in his life and
[1:00:03] one day he he he hit it
[1:00:07] he finally hit it
[1:00:10] and he was making his way back into town
[1:00:12] too to cash his gold in
[1:00:15] because in that form
[1:00:20] it was gold
[1:00:22] but it wasn't spendable
[1:00:27] and so he came to the portion of a town
[1:00:29] that
[1:00:30] he was getting close
[1:00:32] this would be the last night
[1:00:35] to which that he would have to spend
[1:00:38] as a poor man
[1:00:40] or a digger
[1:00:42] but what he didn't know there was a dog
[1:00:46] that there was a man that was following
[1:00:48] him
[1:00:49] and this man had a purpose
[1:00:51] he didn't go dig the goal
[1:00:54] he didn't go labor for the gold
[1:00:56] but he knowed that he had it
[1:01:00] and he was going to take it away from
[1:01:02] him
[1:01:03] and this man that had dug the gold had a
[1:01:06] dog
[1:01:07] and that dog was warning
[1:01:10] warning the man that discovered it
[1:01:13] the man was trying to sleep it was his
[1:01:15] last night of being poor he was trying
[1:01:18] to sleep tomorrow i'll be rich tomorrow
[1:01:20] i'll be rich this dog was the voice of
[1:01:23] warning
[1:01:25] and he was warning he was warning that
[1:01:28] that prospector that there was somebody
[1:01:31] that was following him
[1:01:33] and the man became very agitated
[1:01:37] with that with that voice of warning and
[1:01:40] so he shot that dog
[1:01:44] he shot the dog and what he didn't
[1:01:46] realize he shot the only thing
[1:01:50] that was his protector
[1:01:52] between life and death
[1:01:55] for those that's been around a while
[1:01:57] this was the thought that i used at
[1:02:00] brother brother homer frazier's funeral
[1:02:03] how many remember that
[1:02:06] brother homer had been the voice of
[1:02:08] warning for so many people
[1:02:14] and god had taken that chess piece off
[1:02:17] of the scene
[1:02:18] we must realize
[1:02:20] and what i was trying to get to
[1:02:24] that it's got to be more than daddy's
[1:02:26] religion or
[1:02:28] or a certain religion in the world
[1:02:31] it's got to be christ with you
[1:02:36] and so many wanted to in this local area
[1:02:39] wanted to discredit brother homer
[1:02:43] being too emotional or when he would
[1:02:46] preach at funerals he would he would get
[1:02:48] right in people's cur and and he would
[1:02:50] get right with them but what they didn't
[1:02:52] realize when you turn down christ
[1:02:58] hey listen there's a i got a long way to
[1:03:00] go here help me now
[1:03:03] somewhere in your journey when you turn
[1:03:05] down christ i do not want to be known
[1:03:10] for living 70 80 90 years on the earth
[1:03:14] and somewhere in that juncture about 45
[1:03:17] years along that journey you made a left
[1:03:19] turn
[1:03:21] and you never got back to where you got
[1:03:23] off
[1:03:26] [Applause]
[1:03:33] brother branham tells a story about a
[1:03:35] man dying on the battlefield
[1:03:39] and said another man came and he said i
[1:03:41] knew christ at one time
[1:03:44] and he says what do i do he said go back
[1:03:46] where you left him
[1:03:50] and he prayed a childhood
[1:03:56] prayer how many decades did that man
[1:04:01] how many decades did that man
[1:04:03] live
[1:04:05] and now he's at the point of death
[1:04:07] minutes from dying
[1:04:08] but he has the opportunity to go back
[1:04:12] you talk about grace
[1:04:18] after the meeting was over
[1:04:21] we generally do something with the
[1:04:22] speakers that can go
[1:04:24] brother aaron that will speak again for
[1:04:27] us brother aaron oglesby
[1:04:30] he's a he was a high school teacher
[1:04:34] a history teacher
[1:04:36] i think that's one of one of the keys
[1:04:38] that makes him such a phenomenal speaker
[1:04:42] but anyway
[1:04:43] he's not only a history teacher but he's
[1:04:45] a civil war
[1:04:47] specialist
[1:04:48] so he we went to we went to we targeted
[1:04:51] on monday went to antietam
[1:04:54] and then we went to gettysburg
[1:04:56] now it's one
[1:04:58] thing to go and look it all over and
[1:05:01] see corn see fences see statues
[1:05:04] read all about it but for a man that has
[1:05:06] studied in his life
[1:05:10] and is a preacher
[1:05:12] he can literally figuratively
[1:05:14] make that battle live
[1:05:17] amen
[1:05:18] and so at antietam i begin to realize
[1:05:22] he has studied this
[1:05:24] he's ready for it
[1:05:26] he's anointed for this day
[1:05:28] and we're on more than a tour
[1:05:33] second
[1:05:34] day we went and
[1:05:38] we went to gettysburg
[1:05:41] they were calling for a hundred percent
[1:05:42] chance of rain all day
[1:05:45] when we arrived it quit raining
[1:05:51] and it started raining after we left
[1:06:02] we toured it it took us about
[1:06:04] this tour was supposed to take about
[1:06:06] three hours it took us much longer than
[1:06:08] that
[1:06:10] and we came to the place where
[1:06:12] general lee
[1:06:14] was looking a mile away at general meade
[1:06:17] and i'm not going to tell you the civil
[1:06:19] war
[1:06:23] two opposing forces
[1:06:26] and general lee was getting ready to
[1:06:28] give the command
[1:06:30] to charge up that hill
[1:06:33] the war is going to go on two more years
[1:06:36] but they're going to go to where what
[1:06:37] they call the high water mark
[1:06:42] lee realized
[1:06:44] understanding
[1:06:47] lee realized
[1:06:49] we've got to do this
[1:06:52] we've got we come to this battle by now
[1:06:55] standing with lee
[1:06:57] was picket
[1:06:59] some of our father's
[1:07:01] grandfathers
[1:07:03] was with pickett
[1:07:06] research
[1:07:07] tells me i thought it was two but
[1:07:10] research tells me
[1:07:12] i had three grandfathers
[1:07:15] in that in that charge
[1:07:18] now i'm going to tell you this
[1:07:22] there was so much lead exchange that day
[1:07:25] it was like waves of lead
[1:07:27] being exchanged backwards and forwards
[1:07:31] until one rail fence
[1:07:34] just one rail
[1:07:36] had over
[1:07:38] 860 pieces of lead
[1:07:42] in that rail
[1:07:45] for three of my grandfathers to make
[1:07:47] that charge
[1:07:52] and live
[1:07:58] one was a neens
[1:08:02] one was a wickham
[1:08:04] and he was a colonel
[1:08:06] and i don't and right now the other name
[1:08:08] won't come to me
[1:08:09] maybe a smith
[1:08:11] but
[1:08:12] all three of them made the charging in
[1:08:14] wickham brother george quinn i know
[1:08:16] you'll watch this and you can tell me
[1:08:18] that third one's name
[1:08:22] but
[1:08:23] but let me just say this to you
[1:08:26] you think
[1:08:28] that you're not protected by god
[1:08:33] as i stood in the middle of that field
[1:08:36] and then later we would stand at the top
[1:08:38] of that field
[1:08:40] and we would look down
[1:08:42] from where generals died
[1:08:47] great men gave their life
[1:08:49] for a cause
[1:08:53] poor men fight rich man's battles
[1:08:57] that's what happens
[1:08:59] but they listen let me just say we've
[1:09:02] came to this battle
[1:09:05] there must be a resurrection
[1:09:09] there must be a rapture
[1:09:11] we're not here to just have an have
[1:09:14] another church
[1:09:16] we just didn't have that meeting that we
[1:09:18] had last week to say we had a great
[1:09:21] meeting and you know now let's just
[1:09:23] settle down we got to keep going up
[1:09:44] there's a story that spurgeon pills
[1:09:48] in history there was a
[1:09:50] a great cliff
[1:09:52] great boulder
[1:09:54] monstrous boulder that
[1:09:57] was out over top of this cliff
[1:10:02] it made a great shelter for a man
[1:10:04] in the night
[1:10:07] from a rainstorm
[1:10:10] i want you to follow this very closely
[1:10:12] but this man set up shelter
[1:10:15] there
[1:10:16] then he set up life
[1:10:21] then he got married
[1:10:23] then he had children
[1:10:25] then he had a colony
[1:10:27] all under this danger
[1:10:34] this boulder is going to give way
[1:10:37] but now he's living with sin
[1:10:42] and it's over his head
[1:10:44] knowing that one day it'll collapse
[1:10:48] but now it's more than just him
[1:10:52] sin affects more than just you
[1:10:56] [Applause]
[1:10:58] it affects more than just your family
[1:11:00] and then a family becomes a community
[1:11:03] and a community becomes a town and a
[1:11:05] town becomes a city
[1:11:08] [Music]
[1:11:10] geologists came and warned them
[1:11:12] why are you living here
[1:11:14] amen
[1:11:16] spurgeon said he preached a sermon on it
[1:11:18] you can go read it he preached a sermon
[1:11:20] on it he said people can live under the
[1:11:22] devastation of sin
[1:11:25] and he said they'll live and they die
[1:11:27] and they live their life out not
[1:11:29] realizing they're passing their sins to
[1:11:31] the next generation
[1:11:35] but there's a cure for it to get moved
[1:11:38] move don't stay here
[1:11:40] [Applause]
[1:11:42] don't stay here
[1:11:48] you know the end of the story before i
[1:11:49] even tell you
[1:11:52] that man died his family died
[1:11:55] but a city was crushed
[1:11:59] imagine how many thousands of people
[1:12:03] had decided
[1:12:05] it's not worth listening to the warning
[1:12:15] los angeles has been told that they're
[1:12:17] going under the sea
[1:12:21] but a voice of warning came and told
[1:12:23] them
[1:12:24] because god don't send he don't bring
[1:12:26] judgment until he wins a warning
[1:12:29] and brother branham's message was not
[1:12:32] only it was a message people say well it
[1:12:34] was so difficult no no no no you got it
[1:12:37] wrong it was a message of grace
[1:12:42] it was a message of grace
[1:12:44] all but he told us how to dress well if
[1:12:47] that's the way god wants you to dress
[1:12:52] i'll take god's choice
[1:12:55] [Applause]
[1:12:59] well he won't let us drink wine and he
[1:13:00] won't let us drink beer really
[1:13:05] really is that what's got you all upset
[1:13:07] that your brain cells are not destroyed
[1:13:22] well marriage and divorce upsets me so
[1:13:24] much
[1:13:25] really
[1:13:27] we can have great families and great
[1:13:30] husbands and wives and we can have an
[1:13:32] altar in our house and our our children
[1:13:35] can love to come to church
[1:13:37] [Applause]
[1:13:39] they can love to come to church and they
[1:13:41] can enjoy it
[1:13:47] sitting around the table last night
[1:13:49] isaac is repeating many things of of
[1:13:52] andrew's sermon
[1:13:55] these little guys may look like they're
[1:13:57] not paying any attention at all but they
[1:14:00] are paying very much attention
[1:14:04] they can handle god's word
[1:14:07] [Applause]
[1:14:20] okay
[1:14:34] last week we had many different
[1:14:36] deliverances
[1:14:39] but they can't stay where they were
[1:14:43] just to fall back into the same rut
[1:14:47] and live the same way that they did
[1:14:50] you can't stand there
[1:14:54] we live in america
[1:14:56] i don't know i'm just going to talk
[1:14:58] about america now we live in america
[1:15:00] where gambling
[1:15:02] is is one of the biggest habits that
[1:15:05] people are involved in
[1:15:08] gas stations
[1:15:09] really don't even
[1:15:11] are not really concerned whether they
[1:15:12] sell gas or not as long as they have a
[1:15:15] gambling room
[1:15:16] i'm not getting that second hand in now
[1:15:19] but they build a room for gambling
[1:15:21] partner where you can go in and just
[1:15:22] play and punch punch
[1:15:24] listen you're not going to win
[1:15:27] i don't know if you've got the bulletin
[1:15:29] or not but you're not going to win
[1:15:30] sitting there keeping putting dollars in
[1:15:32] they're going to win
[1:15:34] they're only going to give you enough to
[1:15:36] keep you coming
[1:15:40] but i want to say this to you don't
[1:15:43] gamble with your soul
[1:15:58] andrew talked last night
[1:16:01] and i thought oh here we go
[1:16:04] and he talked about the road to emmaus
[1:16:11] and right there's my note on the road to
[1:16:13] emmaus
[1:16:15] that was already there
[1:16:17] for two weeks
[1:16:20] so
[1:16:21] since you put it on my heart too
[1:16:25] i'll just i'll just talk to you a little
[1:16:26] bit about it
[1:16:30] now the reason i'm going at this pace is
[1:16:32] my energy level's a little bit lower
[1:16:34] so is this all right
[1:16:36] [Applause]
[1:16:37] at least i'm still going
[1:16:39] [Applause]
[1:16:45] and so
[1:16:46] so these boys had saw they had saw the
[1:16:49] trial
[1:16:50] these were disciples they had saw the
[1:16:52] trial
[1:16:54] they never expected that
[1:16:57] they really never expected that
[1:16:59] they saw him get
[1:17:01] scourged
[1:17:04] and he was beat
[1:17:05] they didn't put some isaiah 53 with
[1:17:09] him being physically beat
[1:17:12] to where that
[1:17:13] now
[1:17:14] his organs is showing through his ribs
[1:17:16] that's right
[1:17:20] they never put isaiah 53 the prophecy
[1:17:23] with the happening
[1:17:26] amen
[1:17:28] are you with me
[1:17:29] it's really hard for you to
[1:17:32] to have prophecy and time to intersect
[1:17:34] and you catch it
[1:17:39] so that's why i'm preaching here this
[1:17:40] morning
[1:17:41] and so
[1:17:43] and so they're standing watching jesus
[1:17:46] knowing he has power to call 10 000
[1:17:50] angels
[1:17:51] and he don't do it
[1:17:54] this is the same man that beat and took
[1:17:56] cords and put them together and beat
[1:17:59] those there's pharisees and those
[1:18:01] sadducees and whip them out of the
[1:18:03] temple
[1:18:05] they see them get mad and tell them
[1:18:07] you've turned my father's house into a
[1:18:09] den of thieves
[1:18:11] they've seen him calm the storm
[1:18:15] they were in the boat they seen him calm
[1:18:17] the storm
[1:18:19] they saw him call lazarus out of a grave
[1:18:23] tell him take a grade clothes off of him
[1:18:25] we're getting ready to go have dinner
[1:18:27] [Applause]
[1:18:29] they've seen the damsel arise they've
[1:18:32] seen him feed the 5000 twice
[1:18:36] they've seen legion become a
[1:18:38] real man
[1:18:41] they've seen blind bartimaeus
[1:18:44] not blind no more and under a new
[1:18:46] identification
[1:18:49] but now they're seeing jesus allow
[1:18:52] himself
[1:18:58] they were asleep
[1:19:00] when jesus prayed
[1:19:05] father
[1:19:12] let this cup pass from me
[1:19:17] when he realizes i've got to pay for the
[1:19:19] sins of the world
[1:19:22] not just heal five thousand or or or
[1:19:25] feed five thousand
[1:19:26] or raise lazarus from the grave or tell
[1:19:29] them who that i am
[1:19:30] but his greatest task
[1:19:33] was pay for a man to pay for
[1:19:36] all
[1:19:37] sin
[1:19:40] listen moses identified himself as an
[1:19:43] attribute of god
[1:19:45] abraham identified as an attribute of
[1:19:47] god phenomenal prophets
[1:19:49] listen
[1:19:50] they're stood noah on the ark preaching
[1:19:53] 120 years knowing only eight people were
[1:19:55] wanted going to stay on that ark
[1:19:58] and yet on the other side some of them
[1:20:00] were not
[1:20:01] going to do the will of the father
[1:20:06] are you with me now
[1:20:09] stay with me
[1:20:11] no wonder these disciples were
[1:20:13] discouraged
[1:20:15] they watched jesus
[1:20:17] surrender to the cross
[1:20:34] sometimes we pray for things
[1:20:36] and we get them
[1:20:37] and then they cry on us
[1:20:45] don't be discouraged in there
[1:20:48] enjoy that
[1:20:50] enjoy that that's life
[1:20:52] that's life
[1:20:54] i always took on my babies got all upset
[1:20:57] you know
[1:20:58] you know sometimes as parents we get all
[1:21:00] embarrassed and our children are acting
[1:21:02] up
[1:21:02] you know you know do your best to kind
[1:21:04] of keep them in line
[1:21:06] but it's life
[1:21:08] god watches us sometimes get upset
[1:21:11] he don't sweep us off of the earth
[1:21:17] just life
[1:21:23] key that's a key
[1:21:27] now
[1:21:29] these boys are walking away
[1:21:31] they're so discouraged
[1:21:34] brother branham begins to say
[1:21:36] these latest happenings
[1:21:38] that have happened
[1:21:40] so discourages them they're walking
[1:21:44] and a man joins them
[1:21:49] and they don't recognize who he is
[1:21:52] and he's walking with them
[1:21:54] now here's where i want to go with this
[1:21:58] i wonder sometimes if we realize
[1:22:00] meeting last week meeting before last
[1:22:02] week meetings before and even this
[1:22:04] morning
[1:22:05] that he comes into our services and he
[1:22:07] comes many ways
[1:22:10] you know we all we all can feel him when
[1:22:12] the
[1:22:13] the rain the fire is going we're all
[1:22:15] standing we're cheering we're screaming
[1:22:17] we all can feel the presence of god but
[1:22:19] when he's quiet
[1:22:23] when he's quiet when he's kind of in
[1:22:25] that loving mood
[1:22:27] you know what i'm talking about when
[1:22:28] he's in that loving mood
[1:22:30] and it's just you and him
[1:22:32] you're sitting at the pew and you feel
[1:22:35] you kind of feel the presence of the
[1:22:36] lord jesus walks up beside of them they
[1:22:39] don't recognize who he is
[1:22:42] and he's with them there's nothing you
[1:22:44] can do greater than walk with jesus
[1:22:51] well i haven't had any supernatural
[1:22:52] happening today really
[1:22:54] you walk with him
[1:22:57] he came to your house
[1:22:59] he was there you had a peaceful day
[1:23:02] in laodicea
[1:23:06] children went to school
[1:23:08] they wasn't bullied they wasn't all of
[1:23:10] this different kind of thing and they
[1:23:11] walked with jesus and he took them by
[1:23:14] the hand
[1:23:16] angels are there to protect them maybe a
[1:23:19] car would have ran over them in the
[1:23:20] driveway and an angel just scooted them
[1:23:23] this way
[1:23:24] sometimes it's not what you see
[1:23:28] oh come on church
[1:23:30] come on church
[1:23:32] sometimes we want to be so spiritual
[1:23:36] we want to be speaking in tongues and
[1:23:38] seeing visions and all these different
[1:23:40] just walk with him
[1:23:42] walk with him when you're sick
[1:23:44] walk with him when you die
[1:23:45] walk with him when you could just
[1:23:50] just walk with him
[1:23:58] walk with him when you're getting a's
[1:24:00] walk with him when you're getting
[1:24:04] bees and seas and d's and
[1:24:08] just keep walking with him
[1:24:16] in this six-hour conversation with jesus
[1:24:21] andrew went through it with you
[1:24:24] he reminds them of the prophecies
[1:24:27] and he carefully asked them because
[1:24:30] remember brother branham said would you
[1:24:32] like to hear what jesus talked to them
[1:24:34] about
[1:24:35] amen
[1:24:38] now now let's just remember this
[1:24:42] brother branham told us what eve looked
[1:24:44] like
[1:24:47] i wonder how he knew that
[1:24:51] he talked to us about how melchizedek
[1:24:54] operated
[1:24:56] and then showed us
[1:24:58] how melchizedek operated
[1:25:04] it wasn't a show to the world
[1:25:07] but we got to see jesus
[1:25:10] in our day in our church
[1:25:15] and what is he doing among us even now
[1:25:18] he's reminding us that the prophecy that
[1:25:21] has been laying there for centuries
[1:25:25] even thousands of years
[1:25:28] is about to become active
[1:25:34] when you're talking about resurrection
[1:25:36] power he has showed us
[1:25:39] in in from winter
[1:25:41] to spring
[1:25:43] and the the the
[1:25:45] power that's in the seed that lays
[1:25:48] dormant through the wrath of the winter
[1:25:51] because the sap has went down and then
[1:25:54] that spring sun begins to shine on it
[1:25:57] again and all of a sudden those leaves
[1:26:00] become listen i love that
[1:26:03] now i love that i love the fall how god
[1:26:07] paints those that's never been to the
[1:26:09] shenandoah valley we live in one of the
[1:26:11] most beautiful places in the world we
[1:26:13] have all different varieties of the tree
[1:26:16] and every one of those trees will go in
[1:26:18] a different shape and a different color
[1:26:20] and it's just god's painting all over it
[1:26:28] but that painting is telling us that
[1:26:30] winter is coming
[1:26:32] what's going on now in this harvest ring
[1:26:35] it's preparing us that there's coming a
[1:26:38] resurrection
[1:26:41] and that we're going to see the dead in
[1:26:43] christ rise first
[1:26:45] and we're going to meet the lord in
[1:26:47] vietnam
[1:26:50] because we can't stay here
[1:26:55] we can't stay here
[1:27:06] now
[1:27:08] the bride must be in step with the word
[1:27:13] if you remember he told adam don't add
[1:27:16] or take away
[1:27:17] don't eat of that tree
[1:27:20] and when he ate of that tree it sent him
[1:27:22] in a it sent him in a trajectory
[1:27:25] so we're reminded that like we have been
[1:27:27] speaking on the orchestra
[1:27:30] don't change the sheet music
[1:27:33] just just don't do it
[1:27:34] don't don't change the sheet music
[1:27:39] now elaheezer's job
[1:27:42] he was a type of the messenger that
[1:27:45] would come in our day
[1:27:47] and we wasn't to fall in love and marry
[1:27:49] brother branham but we were to fall in
[1:27:52] love with the message to get us ready
[1:27:54] for jesus christ
[1:27:56] because we're not just one of the
[1:27:57] girlfriends we're the wife
[1:28:00] [Music]
[1:28:01] and rebecca was going to be his wife and
[1:28:04] and and and the songs written about it
[1:28:06] elohizer tell me more what does he
[1:28:08] really look like
[1:28:15] we would learn about isaac
[1:28:18] hear about isaac
[1:28:20] but remember
[1:28:22] she couldn't stay in her homeland and be
[1:28:24] married to isaac
[1:28:26] so the angel had to get ahead of
[1:28:28] eloheeser and meet with her and give her
[1:28:31] the nudge
[1:28:34] so what has been happening to you is
[1:28:37] there's angel visitations
[1:28:39] [Music]
[1:28:41] that happens in your hall
[1:28:48] now so i don't point nobody out here
[1:28:51] brother john steeman is a phenomenal
[1:28:54] example
[1:28:57] he
[1:28:58] hated
[1:28:59] this message
[1:29:02] hated it
[1:29:03] he moved his wife all across the country
[1:29:06] trying to get her away
[1:29:08] finally in sarasota florida
[1:29:11] she was going long story short she was
[1:29:14] going him being mennonite she was
[1:29:17] going to a baptismal service and he was
[1:29:20] so
[1:29:21] mad
[1:29:24] he was going to take the children he was
[1:29:26] going to leave with the children he was
[1:29:28] going to go
[1:29:29] they were going to leave
[1:29:31] because she was following this message
[1:29:33] of the hour
[1:29:34] that her mother had got healed of cancer
[1:29:39] they had witnessed the angel's
[1:29:41] visitation they had witnessed many
[1:29:43] things
[1:29:44] and he is so mad that she's going to to
[1:29:47] a baptismal service and he's going
[1:29:50] around the house and you know those old
[1:29:52] houses to where you would have a path
[1:29:53] all the way around
[1:29:55] we used to chase a dog all the way
[1:29:57] around like that and play tag all the
[1:29:59] way around some of you probably got one
[1:30:00] of them houses where you just run you
[1:30:02] run from all those rooms
[1:30:04] all the way around that deal
[1:30:06] and he was going around and about his
[1:30:08] seventh time around he said i'll go with
[1:30:11] you
[1:30:15] she's thinking he's gonna mess something
[1:30:18] up
[1:30:22] and he got baptized
[1:30:26] because there was a seed there
[1:30:30] god never gave up on him
[1:30:32] regardless of all his nonsense
[1:30:36] if there's a seed inside of you he'll
[1:30:39] never give up on you
[1:30:54] all right
[1:31:07] very personal friend of mine brother jim
[1:31:09] babb
[1:31:12] he's gone to be with the lord
[1:31:15] he married a general's daughter
[1:31:19] beautiful young lady
[1:31:22] kind of living
[1:31:24] he had been a baseball player and got
[1:31:25] his i believe it was his knee blowed out
[1:31:28] well the big leagues didn't want him no
[1:31:30] more so he joins the military and the
[1:31:32] military puts him into baseball
[1:31:35] pretty snazzy deal
[1:31:37] the general wanted him to watch over his
[1:31:40] daughter
[1:31:41] and his daughter
[1:31:43] turned out to be his wife
[1:31:46] that's pretty slick
[1:31:49] his mother and father were message
[1:31:51] believers and he thought he was getting
[1:31:52] away from the message by leaving
[1:31:55] and going and following his ambitions
[1:31:58] one day he comes home and he's always
[1:32:00] getting packages of tapes in the mail
[1:32:02] never paying no attention throwing them
[1:32:04] aside one day he comes home and his wife
[1:32:06] is all crying and and
[1:32:09] and she said jimmy why didn't you tell
[1:32:11] me and i'm just paraphrasing here why
[1:32:13] didn't you tell me about what's in these
[1:32:15] tapes
[1:32:16] she's done give her heart to the lord
[1:32:19] and he said god what have you done with
[1:32:21] my wife
[1:32:23] the general's
[1:32:24] daughter and what he had tried to move
[1:32:27] her away from she got right into because
[1:32:30] she was a seed
[1:32:36] and maybe along your road you have
[1:32:38] journeyed
[1:32:42] i have never yet put you from brazil
[1:32:46] with a guy from harrisonburg
[1:32:51] and you come to this church in covet
[1:32:54] conditions
[1:32:56] and you stuck
[1:32:58] when there's about 10 of us here
[1:33:02] you had no idea that all of these people
[1:33:05] were going to be your brothers and
[1:33:06] sisters in christ
[1:33:09] and you come from way over there and
[1:33:11] here you come and you sit down and go
[1:33:13] boy this must have been a small church
[1:33:16] this must be a church way in decline
[1:33:18] what in the world's going on preacher
[1:33:20] gets up and preaches a couple people
[1:33:22] sings and you know they have church
[1:33:24] dismissed nobody shakes your hand no
[1:33:27] they survived
[1:33:29] [Music]
[1:33:32] they got no special pampering no special
[1:33:34] watering and no no
[1:33:38] but because they were sick
[1:33:43] [Applause]
[1:33:53] brother lawrence would drive by this
[1:33:54] place and many years ago he was here he
[1:33:57] was he was an absolute pillar of this
[1:33:59] church
[1:34:00] circumstance happened crushed him and he
[1:34:03] was out for decades and he would drive
[1:34:06] by this place in delivery and every time
[1:34:08] he drove by something would echo in his
[1:34:10] heart
[1:34:11] and he said the hardest journey i ever
[1:34:13] made was from the parking lot to the
[1:34:15] back door but he said immediately when i
[1:34:17] walked in i knew i was home
[1:34:20] [Applause]
[1:34:33] i'm sorry
[1:34:37] god has put us all on a journey
[1:34:41] and it's a journey that com just
[1:34:43] commissions just to keep walking
[1:34:47] never settle down
[1:34:49] and get relaxed and make a camp
[1:34:53] and say i don't have to go any further
[1:34:55] there's always further with god
[1:35:04] now remember this
[1:35:06] well brother ron i don't understand
[1:35:08] everything
[1:35:10] well let me give you a quote that will
[1:35:12] fit your need
[1:35:14] brother branham said through out the
[1:35:16] eternities
[1:35:18] i don't even know how you explain
[1:35:19] eternities
[1:35:25] david how old are you
[1:35:29] you're older than me
[1:35:35] but 62 is nothing to 200.
[1:35:39] you would have to live three lifetimes
[1:35:42] plus 20 more years to get to 200.
[1:35:45] and 200 is nothing to a thousand
[1:35:49] and a thousand is nothing to a hundred
[1:35:51] thousand
[1:35:54] and a hundred thou oh you're with me now
[1:35:58] are you with me there's not going to be
[1:35:59] a big bend there's not going to be a
[1:36:01] timex swarsky or no swiss watch ever
[1:36:05] going to be in heaven
[1:36:07] [Applause]
[1:36:18] well i'm gonna rest when i get there
[1:36:20] well
[1:36:21] i'm gonna have a new body
[1:36:25] and what i understand in that new body
[1:36:27] it ain't gonna get tired
[1:36:29] [Applause]
[1:36:31] i'm not gonna feel what i feel right now
[1:36:33] in that new body it's not gonna get
[1:36:35] tired imagine that
[1:36:41] i might just run a marathon every
[1:36:44] [Applause]
[1:36:50] day andrew you want to run a little
[1:36:53] while
[1:36:54] matthew might say you know down there on
[1:36:56] earth i couldn't run with you boys but
[1:36:58] that's built for power i think i'll run
[1:37:00] with you guys today
[1:37:03] [Applause]
[1:37:13] the other night i prayed for brother tim
[1:37:15] to have a special visitation
[1:37:17] while he was while he was there at the
[1:37:20] house
[1:37:24] he came to the table
[1:37:27] and he was crying
[1:37:29] and he said all night it was just all
[1:37:31] night
[1:37:32] i was with sister karen and we was both
[1:37:34] young
[1:37:38] that meant the absolute world to me
[1:37:42] that meant the absolute world to me
[1:37:48] joshua knew
[1:37:49] we've came out of
[1:37:51] we came out of egypt we're out here in
[1:37:52] the wilderness but we can't stay here
[1:37:57] it was a type of us coming out of
[1:37:59] denominationalism
[1:38:01] and maybe even got under certain
[1:38:02] speakers that were eloquent incredible
[1:38:04] speakers in the message but they were
[1:38:06] just about kingdom building
[1:38:08] we're not about kingdom building here
[1:38:11] jesus is
[1:38:12] foremost
[1:38:14] this word is foremost
[1:38:19] but we can't stay here
[1:38:23] under the breach
[1:38:25] we had to come out of denominationalism
[1:38:29] and
[1:38:30] god had to change it from
[1:38:32] from under that that that administration
[1:38:36] unto a new administration
[1:38:38] to where it was not denominations
[1:38:42] and it was not the thoughts of the
[1:38:43] tables of those churches
[1:38:46] but god was going to raise a bride
[1:38:50] and he was going to give her an open
[1:38:51] book
[1:38:53] and under the open book it would be a
[1:38:56] new
[1:38:56] administration
[1:38:59] of the son of man of this age
[1:39:02] and under that spoken word he would
[1:39:04] bring a bride into existence
[1:39:09] bringing us from the chicken yard
[1:39:17] well we realized
[1:39:19] it might hurt our families
[1:39:23] but worms just wasn't our diet
[1:39:30] you know
[1:39:31] going to church and getting beat on all
[1:39:33] the time
[1:39:35] that ain't my dot
[1:39:37] i don't think this is a place to where
[1:39:39] you have to get beat every time you walk
[1:39:41] in
[1:39:44] i think this is a place to where you
[1:39:46] want to be inspired
[1:39:48] motivated
[1:39:49] encouraged
[1:39:51] strengthened
[1:39:52] refilled
[1:39:56] empowered by the holy ghost
[1:39:59] to live the life
[1:40:01] strengthened by the dynamics and the
[1:40:04] mechanics of the word
[1:40:06] you
[1:40:13] what about that what about that person
[1:40:15] the way they dress or what about that
[1:40:17] habit in that person's life don't you
[1:40:19] worry about that
[1:40:23] we got too many people wanting to clean
[1:40:25] fish before they ever catch them
[1:40:36] now i'm i'm personally really
[1:40:38] i'm really not a fisherman
[1:40:41] but i am a hunter
[1:40:44] and i really like to hunt deer
[1:40:46] and i know one thing
[1:40:48] you can't skin him till you get him on
[1:40:51] the ground
[1:40:57] well brother on that's kind of barbaric
[1:40:59] okay
[1:41:00] let me go back to the fishing
[1:41:04] you can't have fish fillets
[1:41:11] you can't have fish fillets you can't
[1:41:13] have fish sticks
[1:41:16] you can't have fish steaks
[1:41:19] until you catch them
[1:41:23] and i'm not really good at catching them
[1:41:25] you just
[1:41:28] i catch trees i catch all different kind
[1:41:30] of things i catch andrew
[1:41:35] i throw it out
[1:41:38] whatever comes off
[1:41:40] but when i get a hulk to one
[1:41:42] [Music]
[1:41:44] about two years ago i was standing and i
[1:41:47] i had something to eat in my hand
[1:41:52] and one hit my line
[1:41:54] it had to be a marlin
[1:41:57] [Applause]
[1:42:01] all of a sudden i was in a fight for my
[1:42:03] life
[1:42:05] we was in water about that deep
[1:42:08] [Music]
[1:42:09] but the way that thing was fighting
[1:42:16] i wasn't going to get it in so
[1:42:18] the god cut my line
[1:42:26] i said well it was a marlin
[1:42:33] i wish
[1:42:36] but i didn't get to clean him
[1:42:39] as a matter of fact i didn't get to take
[1:42:41] a picture with him
[1:42:44] and a lot of people want to catch
[1:42:46] christians
[1:42:48] and make christians out of them
[1:42:50] before they get out of a bar room
[1:42:54] i'm preaching to you i went around the
[1:42:57] circle so i could catch you
[1:42:59] because i do know how to catch you
[1:43:01] [Music]
[1:43:05] are you with me oh but brother on show
[1:43:07] and so and so and so and so and so and
[1:43:09] so on so don't worry
[1:43:11] if jesus ever meets them in their life
[1:43:13] you can never be the same
[1:43:17] you'd never be the same once jesus meets
[1:43:20] you in your life
[1:43:37] sometimes if we're not careful we'll
[1:43:39] allow wiggle tails
[1:43:42] to get into our experience
[1:43:45] brother brandon explained that to us he
[1:43:46] said it's because there's no fresh flow
[1:43:49] no fresh flow of the holy ghost that's
[1:43:52] more than just having meeting after
[1:43:53] meeting
[1:43:54] but that's every day of your life it's
[1:43:57] brother man uses a term he says how to
[1:43:59] get closer to god
[1:44:00] pray and read your bible boy that sounds
[1:44:02] too simple doesn't it but it is
[1:44:04] fellowship with god
[1:44:08] when you pray
[1:44:10] you know you you ask god to forgive you
[1:44:12] of your sins
[1:44:14] well brother on i haven't sinned today
[1:44:17] really
[1:44:21] am i preaching to the right audience
[1:44:23] [Music]
[1:44:26] your thoughts sound louder in heaven
[1:44:28] than your words do on earth
[1:44:30] what about the guy doing 40 miles an
[1:44:33] hour on 340 and you're behind them
[1:44:36] and you didn't think something wrong
[1:44:43] i see people punching each other all
[1:44:45] over this building right now
[1:44:49] so what you need is a fresh drink from
[1:44:52] the king
[1:44:54] the king wants a fresh drink of
[1:44:56] pentecostal water
[1:44:59] that's not that 1900s it's back to the
[1:45:01] original of acts chapter 2.
[1:45:04] that's what you saw in process last week
[1:45:08] of the worship of the lord
[1:45:11] that's why we have worship warriors here
[1:45:14] that bring us from walmart
[1:45:24] from your jobs and bring you into an
[1:45:27] atmosphere of worship
[1:45:34] well brother i'm afraid people think we
[1:45:36] got wildfire

[1:47:00] and you begin to worship
[1:47:02] and maybe you cannot keep time with your
[1:47:04] hands
[1:47:07] but you'll find your way
[1:47:09] maybe you can't pat your feet
[1:47:12] because you can't get free
[1:47:14] but you'll find your way
[1:47:16] when you begin to think about what jesus
[1:47:18] has already done for you
[1:47:20] and start building on it
[1:47:25] now i'm going i'm going to can i can i

[1:51:05] and homer and said i love you
[1:51:08] with all my heart

[1:51:18] i said a lot of silly things when i woke
[1:51:20] up
[1:51:21] they cut my legs off
[1:51:25] and a lot of other stuff
[1:51:29] but they were just glad to have me talk
[1:51:47] my buddy came into the room
[1:51:49] he said it didn't come to preach your
[1:51:50] funeral
[1:51:56] i'll come to pray for you the prayers of
[1:51:58] the saints have been praying for you
[1:52:03] i was on a ventilator and i couldn't
[1:52:05] talk
[1:52:07] all i could do was move my eyes
[1:52:12] and they set me up
[1:52:16] i kept asking him

[1:52:20] i'm still glad i didn't lose my teeth
[1:52:27] connie came to church
[1:52:30] we're warriors
[1:52:32] i've taught my family to be warriors
[1:52:34] i've taught you as a church to be

[1:52:51] warriors here
[1:52:54] [Applause]
[1:53:07] on all i know was there was a
[1:53:10] two men working on me and the light went
[1:53:13] out
[1:53:14] and i saw a lot
[1:53:16] but it wasn't a light over top of me
[1:53:19] and that's the last thing i remember for
[1:53:21] 36 hours
[1:53:22] and i was brain dead
[1:53:28] but all i know this is
[1:53:30] the same one that spoke to lazarus
[1:53:32] gave me life back again
[1:53:36] and that's the same one that's spoken to
[1:53:38] my ears and says you can't stay here you
[1:53:40] got to move forward
[1:53:44] all of these battles in my life
[1:53:46] got me ready for the one that i'm
[1:53:48] fighting now
[1:53:51] i am not a coward
[1:53:55] and neither am i afraid
[1:53:58] regardless of the reports that are given
[1:54:00] good or bad
[1:54:02] because you can get a good report one
[1:54:04] month and all of a sudden you get a bad
[1:54:05] report but whose report do we believe
[1:54:11] and i'm saying all of this is an example
[1:54:14] for you
[1:54:15] and we have many here and many on the
[1:54:18] field and many by the way of internet
[1:54:20] that are fighting battles that are way
[1:54:23] beyond
[1:54:24] even what mortality can handle but jesus
[1:54:27] is walking with you
[1:54:30] brother joseph in the trial of your life
[1:54:32] that you're going through god's walking
[1:54:34] with you and there's some things you
[1:54:36] don't understand about this battle but
[1:54:38] he's with you but you can't stay here
[1:54:44] you from north carolina that have moved
[1:54:46] and you've got jobs now you've realized
[1:54:48] can't stay here but i didn't preach it
[1:54:50] for that purpose for critics to
[1:54:52] criticize you but you've realized can't
[1:54:55] stay here
[1:54:57] we got to move forward got to do it for
[1:54:59] our children
