You're bound for a city. Oh my my goodness. What a blessing it was last weekend or last last evening to be in the presence of the Lord. Wasn't it a wonderful time just to sit here and to bask in the presence of the almighty God? Me and brother Titus, we were running a business deal on uh Friday and we were listening to the prophet and question and answers and and he was talking about God preparing a way and there in 1964 and he said he said for Noah he said God prepared him an ark. He said but he said if he didn't he said he would have made Noah walk on the water or put some log out there. Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, God's got a way. No matter what it is, he is the way, the truth, and the life. And I'm thankful that God's got a prepared way for this for this hour that we're living in. Well, you say, "What is that way, Brother Andrew?" I say, "It's a message of the hour. It's the prepared way of the Lord." And I'm looking forward to what God has in store for us this morning. Aren't you? &gt;&gt; It's been our It's been an awesome honor to have Brother Kelly Hilderbrandt throughout many years. He's been a bosom friend to each of us. It was the first place that I and brother Matthew went uh especially myself after I give my heart to the Lord and it just sticks out in my mind being there with brother Kelly and brother Kelly has the ability to leave such an impact on your life and our our family and this church has been graced throughout many years to have brother Hilderbrandt come here and speak for us and we don't want to take those things for granted as as we said last night we watched a statesman as he began to preach and deliver the word of God. We saw God come down and vindicate his word. And I believe he's that kind of a God today that he can touch every single one of our needs here. Amen. Let's just stand to our feet. Prepare to worship just a minute. Kia G, he's kept me alive. Amen. Oh, he kept me alive. The Lord has kept me alive through all the years. He's kept me alive. But I'm just as strong as the day that he sent me. Oh, even though the devil thought I'd give up, he never survived. The Lord has kept me alive. He kept me alive. The Lord has kept me alive through all the years. He's kept me alive. Well, I'm just as strong as the day that he sent me. Even though the devil thought I'd give up, he never survived. The Lord has kept me alive. Caleb was a man who was there from the start. He followed the Lord with all of his heart. He's the one who said we're more than able to take the land. Well, he came through the wilderness to thick and threw thin. He even seen a lot of people fall into sin. But after it all, he wanted everyone to understand. Well, he's kept me alive. The Lord has kept me alive through all the years. He's kept me alive. Well, I'm just as strong as the day that he sent me. Even though the devil thought I'd give up and never survived, the Lord has kept me alive. Well, I look at the years, the victories won. I stand amazed at all God has done. Now, whom shall we fear? We're more than able to take the land. Oh, all the storms we giants have fell. We've been at war with Satan, the powers of hell. But by the grace of God, we're all standing and here to tell. Oh, he kept me alive. The Lord's kept me alive. Through all the years, he's kept me alive. Well, I'm just as strong as the day that he sent me. Oh, even though the devil thought I'd give up and never survive, the Lord has kept me alive. Well, David was a man who was after God's heart. He worshiped the Lord with all of his might. He knew goodness, mercy would follow him all of his days. Well, when Goliath came with a spirit and sword, but David, he came in the name of the Lord. And after it all, God made Goliath bow. Oh, he kept me alive. The Lord's kept me alive through all the years. He's kept me alive. Well, I'm just as strong as the day that he sent me. Even though the devil thought I'd give up and never survive, the Lord has kept me alive. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Well, every time I tried to make it on my own, and every time I try to stand to fall and all those lonely roads that I traveled on, well, there was Jesus. Oh, with the life I build came crashing to the ground. Oh, with the friends I have nowhere to be found. I couldn't see it then, but I can see it now. Well, there was Jesus. Aren't you thankful that he's always there? Oh, in the waiting, in the searching, in the healing and the hurting, like a blessing in the broken pieces. Every minute, every moment where I'm where I'm going, even when I didn't know it, who couldn't see it. There was Jesus for this man who needs amazing kind of grace. forgiveness at a price I I couldn't pay. Well, I'm not perfect, so I thank God every day. Oh, there was Jesus. Oh, hallelujah. Oh, in the waiting, in the search, in the healing and the hurting, like the blessings in the broken pieces. every minute, every moment of where I'm where I'm going. Even when I didn't know or couldn't see it. Oh, there was Jesus on the mountains, in the valleys, &gt;&gt; in the shadows of the alleys. Oh, in the fire in the blood always is and always was in the waiting, in the search, in the healing and the hurting. like a blessing buried in the broken pieces. Every minute, every moment of where I'm where I'm going, even when I didn't know it or couldn't see it. Oh, there was Jesus on the mountains in the valleys. Can you identify that? He's been right there all the time in the shadows of the alleys. Oh, in the fire, in the blood. always is and always was. No, I'm never going to walk alone in the waiting, in the searching, in the healing and the hurting like a blessing. I can where I'm going and where I was Jesus. &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful that he's always with you? &gt;&gt; Amen. He promised to be with us even in us till the end of the world. We can certainly say that with all of our heart. Amen. If you have a need on your heart this morning with an uplifted hand as we would look to the Lord in prayer today. Lord Jesus, we say this morning our Lord, we love you with all of our heart. Doesn't matter where we are, Father. We're in the valleys on the mountains. You're always with your children, Lord. The prophet said in the church age book that how do we know that you're with us? It's because you promised it and you said that you were. There's no other court of appeal, Lord, but your word, Lord. I pray, Father, as the spirit is moving even this morning, Lord, that you would meet every need of each person that would be represented here, those that would be streaming online today, Lord. Would you minister, Lord, to the need that they would have in their heart and in their life? And Lord, we believe in the supernatural, Lord, because you are a supernatural God. Be with the sick, Lord. Be with afflicted, Father. be with our assembly back home, Lord, as they're preparing for for uh church themselves, Lord. May the spirit of God move amongst the people. Bless this church, Lord. Bless the ministry of it, Father. Each person has come with their lick of fire, Lord. May we leave here, Lord, a better people, Lord, to serve you more fully, Lord. I commit myself unto you, Lord, soul, body, and spirit for the glory of God that you would have your way this morning hour. Lord, take control of humanity. Father, we commit ourselves unto you now for the glory of Jesus Christ. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. Why don't you take the opportunity to shake somebody's hand beside you, around you, or behind you, and lead each other each other know that you love them with all their heart. Amen. Isn't the Lord good to us this morning? Amen. God bless you all. I say good morning to you all. &gt;&gt; It's good to be in the house of the Lord this morning. Good to see each and every one of you that are here today. And a little cooler out this morning. And I'm not used to the humidity. So, the humidity gets me pretty bad. But back home this morning, I had a message from one of the PE of one of our brothers from the church and minus one Fahrenheit. So, we're a little cooler than what you are, but so I'll I'll take this a little bit of humidity and I don't have to bundle up like a polar bear to go outside. It's a little cool at home, but our church sends our greetings to you and and we're thankful that we have warm buildings and we have places that we can gather together where where the Lord can move amongst his people. It's just good to be back in the house of the Lord with you. I feel like David has said, it's good to be in the house of the Lord. Amen. I don't know what better place to be than than right here. Amen. Sister Meer and myself once again we just like to thank you for your hospitality and for all that you've done for us and all the sweets that are coming in and everybody said you have to eat them all yourself brother Kelly I said nope I said we got only one size of pants with us and that's what we want to leave with and we certainly do appreciate all of your hospitality God bless you for it. Amen. One day we won't have to gather like this anymore. We'll be gathering father's house and it's going to be a grand time. Each one of us going to look like these young men on the front row here, 21 years old, 20 years old. It's going to be a great great thing. Amen. I always say it's going to be the biggest young people meeting that we'll ever go to. And that's one place I don't want to miss. And we're doing our part by the grace of God. And we can say with thoughts of grace that we can count oursel as one of the number that will be there on that particular day. Amen. If I don't see on this side of glory, well, we look forward to the other side. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm just glad that there's some people I'm acquainted with here on the earth that when we get over there, we'll be able to shake one another's hand and and we'll all have the same testimony. We all made it by the grace of almighty God. It's not by any works that we have, but it's solely by the grace of Jesus Christ in each one of our lives. Amen. This morning, I'm going to speak a a message if you want to turn to your Bibles in Philippians chapter 4 verse 6 and 7. I paced the floors last night. I paced the floors early in this morning and was looking to the Lord on what would be his mind to speak today. Uh I don't take it for granted just to stand here. I uh I look at Lord give me something that would help the people, make you real to the people. And I maybe an unusual title today, but I trust that it will be a blessing to you. Walking in peace in a stressed out world. Walking in peace in a stressed out world. Philippians 4 6 and 7 says be careful for nothing but in everything. Let's say everything. &gt;&gt; Everything &gt;&gt; by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be known unto God. Doesn't say in here that we should be downtrodden but it says with thanksgiving. &gt;&gt; I love the next verse. And the peace of God which passes all that say all. All our understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. Also, I'd like to read Proverbs chapter 18 verses 10 this morning if we may. The name of the Lord is a strong tower and the righteous run into it and it's safe. Amen. God bless you. You may have your seats this morning. We live in an incredible time. It's a time that the sages of old have wanted to live in. But it's an incredible age. It's an age where people are stressed out. Uh it doesn't matter who you talk to or where you go. I've had children as young as 10 years old talking to them and trying to counsel with them. They say, "Brother Kelly, I'm just stressed." I'm like, "What? How can you be stressed at 10 years old? You got food every day. You got a warm place to lay your head. I hope the young people are listening. &gt;&gt; Everything's provided for you. And yet you're stressed to the nines. And what can you be so stressed about? Brother Brandham preached a message called letting off the pressure. And he also preached a message called Countdown. In the beginning of the one he preached in Jeffersonville, he said there's a pressure on the people today. And that pressure has no limitation or denominational lines. It has no age limit. It has no respect of persons. It's on young and old, good and bad. It's on everybody. Pressure. We're living in a neurotic age. Nervous tension. Everybody is racing here and going there and going nowhere. It's just to that kind of an age. I know this church would be plagued with it. And everywhere is plagued with it. Tabernacle is plagued with it everywhere. The whole world. It's a day of pressure. Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry up. and wait. &gt;&gt; It seems like that kind of rings true in the hour that we're living in. &gt;&gt; Drive 90 miles an hour and then get home for supper and wait 2 hour till it gets it. That's right. It's a time. It's in that rushing and speeding. It's just gets you to nervous tension. &gt;&gt; It's a thought. This thought that we're speaking of today, it it kind of captivates you and brings you into reality of walking in two worlds at the same time. We're walking in the natural world and we're walking in a supernatural world at the same time. &gt;&gt; But the everyday life which pulls us in many different directions and we face the pressures of life. I I I don't know maybe in America you don't face any pressures but in Canada we got a lot of pressure. There's pressure. There's deadlines you have to meet. There's responsibilities. There's decisions. There's spiritual warfare. Stress is real. &gt;&gt; We all feel it. We all go through it day by day. And sometimes we wonder uh when when we sing and we sing these wonderful songs and they give us such an encouragement. Amen. That God is with us in the mountains and in the valleys. No matter where we are, God is with us. But yet when we when we face the world and we're out of church at that moment, all of a sudden it seems like stress just overwhelms us many times. And actually can cause a lot of distress in the home. As I mentioned before, one of the young girl asked me said to me, "I'm completely stressed out." And I'm like, "How can you be stressed? Nothing to worry about really." But it's this age that we're living in. And the more computerized we become and the more electronic we become and the more the more conveniences we have and the more things that we have available to us the more stressed out we get. &gt;&gt; The dictionary meaning for stress for stress means a constraining force or influence. It means a mental tension just like a pressure that's upon the people. It means to be tense, anxious, or exhausted as a result of pressure, mental stress, or overworked. Amen. You probably hear that today. I I was hearing it back home. Is that that some of the jobs some of the brothers are working on, the people that are working on get half the work done that they got done 20 years ago, and everybody's stressed out, but seemingly they can't get anything hardly done at all anymore because of the stress they're under. I looked up Gallup poll 2021 and at that time it said 42% of adults worldwide are experiencing stress. That was in two 2021 in American psych psychological 2024 it said twothirds of adults reported feeling stressed or anxious. You they have to have a a pill to get them up and a pill to get them down. Amen. Everybody is feeling it. it it becomes something and we're not careful, we drag it with us into our home and cause a nervous tension in the home and the children get nervous tension over it and but there is a hope church and that hope only lies in one person and brother Andrew referred to him this morning. It's in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you want peace, if we want peace, there's only if you turn on the prophet's message, it seems like it just brings a calm into the room and it just reduces the pressure. You turn on a good good singing uh good music and something transpires. It's just something that puts you into a different kind of an atmosphere. Amen. Why do we sing? We come to church so we forget about the problems of life and we can tune in with a that the spirit of God can minister to our every need that we would have. Amen. They said specifically stress was concerning the economy along with world events and technology. The more connected we are, the more we realize what's happening in the world, there's more stress people come out. What's going to happen with this nation or what's going to happen with that nation? I I look at it, I want to know what's going to happen with myself. I want to make it to the other side. Amen. My whole goal in life is is a body change. And and I've never stepped off of that. I I've right from the time I've been a little child, grew up in a message church, a body change is what I've heard of all my life. And I I'm looking forward to that body change because one day and I say one day soon it's going to transpire. The world is gathering together. The world is trying to bring peace and safety. But the more peace they bring try to bring the more stressed out the people become. But there is a bride of the Lord Jesus Christ that is worldwide. Amen. Who are founded in Christ Jesus. And we have a place to let off the pressure. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank God for a place to let off the pressure. &gt;&gt; Amen. Somebody say, "Praise the Lord." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The Bible tells us in St. Luke is that men's hearts are failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth. For the powers of heaven shall be shaken. Even believers, we feel the stress that of life. But there's the reality where we can let off the pressure which is a hidden life in Christ. Amen. In the midst of life, a child of God can walk in peace. &gt;&gt; Amen. Aren't you thankful for that? &gt;&gt; Amen. You can be pressed but not crushed. &gt;&gt; You can be troubled but not distressed. &gt;&gt; You can be stressed out, but you're still standing. &gt;&gt; Amen. It don't matter what the devil brings, he ain't enough. &gt;&gt; Because peace is an absence of pressure. Sometimes people think when I when they come into the message that's the absence of pressure. That's when it begins. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's when life starts to get difficult because all the guns of hell are trained right on you. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's a time when you got to really know who you are in Christ and that Christ is in your heart and you're filled with the Holy Ghost. Amen. Or the pressures of life will come crushing down on you. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm glad for the presence of the Prince of Peace. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's the one that I want walking beside me through the day. &gt;&gt; Amen. St. John 16:33 says, "In the world you shall have tribulation, but be of good cheer." Jesus said, "I have overcome the world." &gt;&gt; Amen. In 2 Timothy 3:1, excuse me for a lot of scripture, but we can get find we can find great find strength in scripture. &gt;&gt; Amen. In 2 Timothy 3, it says, "In the last days, perilous time shall come." We're certainly in the last days. &gt;&gt; I don't know about yourself, but if you listen to just a moment of the news, you can you hear the things that are transpiring. We know we're in the last days. There's wars and rumors of wars. There's earthquakes and and in all kinds of places or there's floods. There's there's there's disasters everywhere. Amen. But in all of that, the bride is walking with something in her heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. With bounce on your heel. Amen. that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; And even though the three Hebrew children, they were facing the fiery flames of affliction of their day and King Nebuchadnezzar was going to put them into the fire, but I believe there was a peace within their heart. Though God, I know God is able to deliver me, but nevertheless, I'm not bowing down to Satan's kingdom. I'm not bowing down to Satan's Eden. I'm going all the way through. Amen. There's a song Brother Wendell sang in our church. I'm going all the way through. There's no turning back for a Christian. Amen. We're going all the way. Let's say, I'm going all the way this morning. Let's say it one more time with passion this morning. I'm going all the way this morning. There's no turning back for a Christian. Amen. It doesn't matter HOW MUCH STRESS YOU'RE UNDER. Jesus Christ is enough in your heart. He's enough in your life. Perilous times means stressful, pressure field. It means chaotic. The world is stressed. &gt;&gt; Brother Jonas, our son, he has people that work for him and there's people taking off constantly for stress leave and they don't know what's going to happen in the world. But the thing that gives you peace is what they don't want in their life. &gt;&gt; They're they're they they're like the the world is overloaded, &gt;&gt; right? The world is overstimulated. They're trying to stimulate their senses and trying to find some peace in that. They're fearful. They're exhausted. Amen. They're discouraged. They're filled with anxiety. But the bride is called to be still. &gt;&gt; Be still and know that I'm God. &gt;&gt; The bride is called to be calm. God is in control of every aspect of your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. And if he's the one that wrote your name in the Lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world, he knows exactly what you're going through right now. Amen. He knows all about it. His hand is over you. He's He's over top of you. He's watching you sometimes to say, "Lord, just keep pushing me along." &gt;&gt; Amen. We're anchored like a tree that's planted by the living waters. We're resting on God's promises. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're rooted in the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're walking in the revelation of the hour of today. Amen. We're in a city of refuge and we know Christ is our refuge. &gt;&gt; When brother Brandon was preaching preaching the message on on on letting off the pressure. He he was talking about the city of refuge that they had in the Old Testament times and and how that if if you had killed somebody or done something, you would try to get to that city as quickly as you could because the your your adversaries were coming behind you to take your life and you would plead your case and once you were in the door, you could let off the pressure. Amen. But he said that we have that pressure place where we can bring all of our needs to and that's the Jesus Christ. Amen. Many times we come to him with our burdens. And I've seen people lay down their burdens at the altar and before they leave the back of the church, they pack them up with them again. They go home complaining and disgruntled and and talking about this and TALKING ABOUT THAT, BUT never breathing the word. Thank you, Lord, for deliverance. Thank you, Lord, for setting me free. Thank you, LORD, FOR TAKING THESE BURDENS OFF ME. AMEN. THANK YOU, LORD, FOR WHAT YOU'RE DOING FOR ME. THANK YOU, LORD, FOR A SOUND MIND. THANK YOU, LORD, FOR PEACE IN MY HEART. THANK YOU, LORD, FOR JOY IN MY HEART. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WE'D RATHER COMPLAIN THAN THAN HAVE THE PEACE OF GOD. AND I SAY, LET'S PUT ASIDE ALL OF OUR COMPLAINING. AMEN. YOUR BROTHER'S NOT THE PROBLEM. YOUR SISTER'S NOT THE PROBLEM. YOUR HUSBAND'S NOT THE PROBLEM. YOUR WIFE'S NOT THE PROBLEM. YOU'RE THE PROBLEM. WHEN you look in the mirror in the morning, Amen. IF WE CAN GET OURSELVES OUT OF THE WAY, WE CAN LET OFF THE PRESSURE. AMEN. Do you believe that this morning? &gt;&gt; Stress comes from overthinking. &gt;&gt; Stress comes from the fear of the future. Stress comes from trying to figure out outcomes. &gt;&gt; I don't know if I'm on the on the rubbers on the road or not, but this what the Lord laid on my heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Andy was praying last night and and when he was talking to the congregation at the end of the service, hoping that Brother Kelly would have something for from the Lord in the morning that he'd be up all night long trying to search for him. Amen. It's sometimes not good when brothers pray like that because what happens that's what happens and you're saying, "Lord, what should I bring to the people?" And and and and this is something that has been so in my own life. Amen. In in my Christian walk with the Lord, if a person's not careful, stress will overtake you in everything you do. &gt;&gt; And the world becomes a very negative place &gt;&gt; and it becomes very negative around self. &gt;&gt; Amen. And people can find that negativism actually transmitting from your own self. But you have somebody that's always joyful. &gt;&gt; Amen. You ask somebody in the morning, "How are you doing this morning?" Say, "I'm doing great." &gt;&gt; The next day you ask them, "How are you doing? You doing HOW CAN YOU BE DOING GREAT EVERY DAY? It's good to be alive. &gt;&gt; It's good to know THAT JESUS IS IN MY CORNER. &gt;&gt; It's good TO KNOW THAT GOD HAS TAKEN care of everything that I have need of spiritually. &gt;&gt; Amen. HE'S GIVEN ME POWER. HE'S GIVEN ME THE fortitude to work to provide a living for our families. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHAT DOES IT THE PEACE OF GOD IN OUR HEART? IF WE WENT THROUGH LIFE NOT KNOWING WHAT TOMORROW WOULD BE, IT WOULD BE a dangerous place to live in. Amen. WE WOULD TRY TO PUT OURSELVES IN A BOX. BUT I'M SO THANKFUL AS THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST, WE CAN GET STILL BEFORE ALMIGHTY GOD. WE KNOW OUR POSITION IN CHRIST, WE'VE GOT THE INDWELLING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT WITH INSIDE OF OUR HEART. AMEN. AND WE'RE WALKING IN VICTORY EVERY SINGLE MOMENT OF THE DAY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. When you wake up in the morning, THE DEVIL THAT'S ASSIGNED TO YOU SHOULD BE THE ONE THAT'S STRESSED OUT. DON'T LET HIM GET YOU STRESSED OUT. YOU LET THE DEVIL BE STRESSED OUT WHEN HE'S ON YOUR GUARD. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I say he's the one that's stressed. Should be stressed. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Stress comes and we try to control what only God can control. &gt;&gt; We worry about outcomes instead of trusting God's oversight. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm just trying to go through some points. &gt;&gt; We magnify problems and mini minimize the promises of the word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see it happen all the time. People are want to focus more on their problem what they do on the promise of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus said in St. Matthew 6:27, "Which of you by taking a thought can add one cubic onto his stature?" And we say that not one of us can do anything. &gt;&gt; Amen. But I read in the Bible is that he's watching over the sparrows. &gt;&gt; He knows exactly how much they need to feed. And I I WATCH THEM IN MY BACKYARD AND I SAY, "LORD, it seems like they don't have a care in the world." Amen. They sit on the tree and they're they're chirping away and they're GIVING PRAISE ON TO ALMIGHTY GOD. AND WE'RE SITTING IN THIS BEAUTIFUL PLACE AND IN OUR NICE, BEAUTIFUL CHAIRS WITH A FIREPLACE ON AND WE'RE STRESSED OUT. AND I SAY, "GOD, HELP US NOT TO BE STRESSED OUT." AMEN. HELP US TO LOOK AT THE PROMISE OF GOD. May we be REMINDED THIS MORNING HOUR. AMEN. TRUST IN ALMIGHTY GOD. DON'T TRUST IN THE ARM OF MAN, BUT TRUST IN ALMIGHTY GOD. AMEN. Man will FAIL YOU, BUT GOD. LET'S SAY GOD. GOD GOD WILL NEVER FAIL YOU. HE'S PROMISED NEVER TO fail you. &gt;&gt; You have to trust in him. &gt;&gt; We often think we can fix this or fix that only to figure out that we can't do anything about it. We try. The more we try, the heavier the stress becomes in our life. Because peace doesn't come from control. Peace comes from release. You get peace when you release. The Bible tells us in 2 Corinth Corinthians 10, casting down, let's say, casting down. Casting down imagination AND BRINGING EVERY THOUGHT INTO the captivity of Christ. Amen. That's what we're to do. WE'RE TO CAST DOWN EVERYTHING THAT'S NOT OF GOD. Cast down our pride. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. Cast down all of our hard feelings. &gt;&gt; Cast down THE THOUGHT THAT BROTHER SO AND SO NEVER SHOOK my hand Sunday morning or sister SO AND SO THEY MUST HAVE SOMETHING AGAINST ME. CAST IT DOWN AND GET IT OUT OF YOUR MIND. DON'T GIVE THE DEVIL ONE THOUGHT OR ONE ROOM. AMEN. TO GET INTO ANY OF THE CRACKS. I SAY CAST IT OUT. You'll see that YOU'LL GET PEACE IN YOUR HEART. But when you start to keep ON KEEP THOSE THINGS IN YOUR HEART, YOUR MIND GETS ALL STRESSED OUT. THERE'S NO PEACE IN YOUR SOUL. YOU'RE WALKING THROUGH LIFE. BUT PRAISE BE THE NAME OF THE LORD. WE CAN COME TO THE HOUSE OF ALMIGHTY GOD. AMEN. AND THE WORD OF GOD CAN BE OUR REFUGE PLACE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that this morning? You can't control everything around you, but you certainly can control what's inside of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham told us that the the hand or the the bird wants to make a roost. He said, "But he said, but we don't have to let him make a roost. &gt;&gt; We can tear it down." Isaiah 26:3, it says, "I will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusteth in thee." It's a powerful word word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. In the Hebrew, the word phrase perfect peace, it actually means shalom. Shalom. &gt;&gt; They put it in there as perfect peace. But it's actually repeated twice. Shalom. Shalom. Amen. I trust in the Lord. And what does he give me? He gives us perfect peace. Whose mind is stayed upon thee because he trustth in thee. That's a place to trust in the Almighty. Amen. Not a fragile calmness or a hope so, but a deep completeness in Almighty God. Amen. Where you know that you stand in the presence of God and that you have favor with Almighty God. &gt;&gt; You say, "How do I know I have favor, Brother Kelly?" Amen. Just follow his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Day by day, follow his word. If something transpired, I'm so thankful for the blood of Jesus Christ. Amen. If there's a ill thought or some thought comes into our mind. Amen. We can plead on the blood and say, "Lord, forgive me that thought." Amen. And God immediately erases it off your record. Amen. Come on, church. Amen. God has provided everything we have needed for this journey. Amen. There's no need for us to be uncom. There's no need for us to be stressed out wondering about outcomes. AMEN. LET'S PUT IT IN THE HANDS OF JESUS CHRIST THIS MORNING HOUR. AMEN. I MAY NOT KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH, BUT HE KNOWS WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH TODAY. AMEN. I SAY THIS MORNING, PUT IT IN THE HANDS OF CHRIST. AMEN. HE'LL TAKE CARE OF OF life's journey for you. Amen. Don't take it away from him, but put it in his hands. Amen. We serve a supernatural God. Amen. We serve a God who wants to fortify our minds and our hearts unto him. I believe that's transpiring. I don't believe that the bride of Jesus Christ is just going to go in on a hope so or a maybe so. We're going in with flying colors in this generation. Amen. IT'S NOT GOING TO BE BY THE SKIN OF OUR TEETH OR BY BY THE SEAT OF OUR PANTS, BUT WE'RE GOING IN AS A VICTORIOUS armor of ARMY OF ALMIGHTY GOD. AMEN. WATCHING WALKING IN STEP WITH A MASTER IN THIS HOUR. AMEN. CHRIST GOING BEFORE US. AMEN. AND WE'RE GOING TO STAND WITH THE DEVIL UNDERNEATH OUR FEET IN THIS HOUR. AND NO DEMON POWER IS GOING TO SHAKE US FROM IT. Maybe give me a little more monitor if you could. Amen. Satan should be completely helpless. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Completely helpless. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE'S TRYING TO DISRUPT YOUR WORLD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. BUT IT'S TIME WE REALIZE OUR POSITION. LET'S SAY MY POSITION. &gt;&gt; THAT I'M A SON OF GOD. I'M A DAUGHTER OF GOD. I'VE GOT A POSITION IN CHRIST. AMEN. HE'S GIVEN ME THE AUTHORITY IN THIS HOUR. AMEN. WE'RE NO DEVIL IN HELL. WE SHOULD BE TEARING DOWN SATAN'S KINGDOM, NOT ALLOWING HIM TO BUILD UP HIS KINGDOM. I SAY, CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD. TEAR DOWN ALL THE GATES OF HELL. AMEN. AND LET CHRIST GIVE YOU CALM IN YOUR HEART. AMEN. LET HIM BE YOUR STRESS RELIEVER. AMEN. We need to WE NEED TO REALIZE WHO WE ARE IN CHRIST JESUS. We're the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're his bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. He doesn't want us to stand as a defeated people. &gt;&gt; Amen. He He HE WON THE VICTORY ON CALVARY. AMEN. The very SAME SPIRIT THAT RESIDED IN JESUS CHRIST HAS POURED INTO THE church of the living God. AMEN. IT'S LIVING IN YOUR HEART. IT'S LIVING IN YOUR SOUL. AMEN. DON'T LET THE DEVIL MOVE ON THE SCENE AND TRY TO DISTRACT YOU IN THIS LATE HOUR. I SAY THIS MORNING HOUR, IT'S GOING HOME TIME THIS MORNING HOUR. AMEN. ONE DAY WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A STEP, AMEN, FROM THIS LIFE INTO IMMORTAL LIFE. AMEN. AND WE'LL STEP RIGHT INTO OUR THEOPHONY INTO OUR GLORIFIED BODY. AMEN. DON'T LET THE DEVIL DISTRACT YOU IN THE HOUR WE'RE LIVING IN. AMEN. Take it serious what God is doing. Sometimes you wonder if people really take it serious. &gt;&gt; Amen. We serve a great God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus never promised life without stress, &gt;&gt; but he gave you the tools. He gave you his word. &gt;&gt; He promised you peace in the midst of stress. &gt;&gt; We know the stories very well in the Bible when when the disciples in St. Mark chapter 4 when the disciples were panicking in the storm. They're in the middle of a storm. Amen. Jesus has just preached a campaign and he's tired and he's in the front of the boat and the devil trying to take an advantage. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the way the devil works it. He works it sometimes Sunday afternoon, Monday morning, he takes advantage. I sometimes I don't know about y'all, but sometimes you're singing I'm one of them. I'm one of them. and you get a phone call and that phone call just disrupts your day and you get all stressed out of it and all a sudden you forget the words, "I'm one of them." That's where we need to keep on saying it. I'm one of them. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm one of them. Amen. It was a bad phone call. It was a bad doctor report. But I'm still one of them. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's been with ME THROUGH EVERY TRIAL. HE'S BEEN WITH ME THROUGH EVERY DIFFICULTY. AMEN. Christ has never for NEVER FORSOOK ME. AMEN. SO WE CAN BE ONE OF THEM WHETHER WE'RE ON THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN OR IN THE VALLEY BELOW. AMEN. SOMEBODY SAY, "PRAISE THE LORD THIS morning hour." Amen. We're living in an incredible time, church. Amen. We may go home this year. Amen. I trust that it'll be that way. &gt;&gt; Amen. I trust that the rapture will come. Amen. We'll walk right out of this world. But they were panicking in the midst of the ocean. They saying they were saying shouting to Jesus, "MASTER, MASTER, MASTER, CARE US NOW." NOT THAT WE PERISH. But Jesus wasn't worried about it. &gt;&gt; He was sleeping on the front of the boat, no doubt, on a pillow. And and just sleeping there calmly and and the same storm that was terrifying THE DISCIPLES HAD NO EFFECT. &gt;&gt; Let's say no effect. &gt;&gt; It had no effect on Jesus. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. Satan can't sink a ship when Christ is inside of it. SATAN CAN'T DESTROY YOU WHEN CHRIST IS INSIDE. But if HE CAN GET YOU TO DISBELIEVE THAT FOR ONE moment he got you licked. &gt;&gt; What did Jesus do? He arose and said, "Peace be still." The waves obeyed him because peace himself spoke. Amen. I love that one place where the Bible says that the storm stilled and they immediately were at the other side. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? Christ is in control. Amen. I say let there be perfect peace in our lives. Though the billows may dash and the world may be in turmoil, but as a Christian, we rest in perfect assurance knowing that God is in control of our life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes we think peace means no burdens. But true peace can coexist with a heavy load. &gt;&gt; When that load is shared with Christ, we know the scripture says, "Come unto me all ye that labor and heavy laden. I'll give you rest. My yoke is easy. My burdens are light." Peace is not the removal of responsibility. It's really the revelation that you're yolked together with Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. I looked that up and and and they say that a team of ox when they're underneath one yolk, they sometimes will put an old ox together with one that's learning. And what happens is is the older ox is the one that's pulling the load. But the younger ox is learning to walk in step with the older one. &gt;&gt; Amen. When we when we're yolked together, when you're yolked together with Christ, Amen. You may be stressed out, but when you walk in step with the Prince of Peace himself, Amen. It gives you gives you the fortitude of how to walk in times of stress. &gt;&gt; Amen. God is teaching us. Amen. How to walk in the world that we're living in. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I I say that world stress. You say, "Will you ever get stressed out again?" Brother Kelly, I probably get stressed out every day, but I take it to the Lord in prayer. Amen. Stress tries to pull me one way, but you can use stress as rocket fuel and as prayer fuel. Amen. Because you can bring it down on the devil himself. Amen. He might tell you you're not worth it. You're never going to make it. You're then he'll tell you all kinds of THINGS IN YOUR EAR, BUT YOU turn around and say, "Sorry, DEVIL. IT'S TOO LATE for all of THAT RIGHT NOW. I AM GOING TO MAKE IT. I AM A CHILD OF GOD. YOU ARE MY HEALER. YOU'RE MY ALL AND ALL." HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Use it for fuel. &gt;&gt; Burn it up. The word keep means to guard. It's a garrison. It's like a soul like a soldiers around a fortress. When Satan when stress attacks your mind, peace stands guard at the gate. &gt;&gt; Amen. Stress says what if it doesn't work out? But peace says that God has already gone before me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Peace. Stress says you're not adequate. Maybe the devil's never told you that. But he told me that a lot of times. &gt;&gt; But peace said Christ in me is more than enough. &gt;&gt; Amen. Stress says this is too much. I can't bear another load of it. But the Bible says he'll always make a way of escape for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Peace says, "My grace is sufficient for you." Amen. He's got it in control. Amen. Peace is something that that grows in the soil of surrender. You cannot produce it by efforts. It's born by abiding in Christ. The more you struggle, the less peace you feel. Amen. The more you surrender, the more peace grows. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Do you believe that this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. Colossians 3:15 says, "Let the peace of God," let's say, "Peace of God &gt;&gt; rule in your hearts." Amen. In other words, let him rule on your throne. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not your emotions. &gt;&gt; Amen. Our emotions will take us many places. You get wrong news. You get fears. Amen. But when peace is the umpire of your soul, it brings a different stage of life for you. Amen. Bible examples we can look at is Daniel in the lion's den. stress all around him, but peace was in his heart. Amen. Because the presence of God was with him in the lion's den. &gt;&gt; Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Paul, Paul and Silas, they were in prison. They were beaten and they were chained. Yet, they sang hymns at midnight. Amen. Peace turned their prison into a sanctuary. What would happen if THAT WOULD TRANSPIRE HERE this morning hour? Amen. When peace becomes YOUR SANCTUARY. AMEN. I SAY AGAIN THIS MORNING, THE DEVIL DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHEN PEACE IS RULING IN YOUR HEART, YOU'VE GOT NOTHING TO FEAR. AMEN. CHRIST IS WITH YOU IN THE SHIP. &gt;&gt; Jesus in Gethsemane under extreme pressure, sweating great drops of blood, he surrendered, saying, "Not my will, but thine be run, thine be done, and surrender produced a victory." Amen. It gave us the greatest thing we could ever get receive. It gave us salvation. Amen. Aren't you grateful for it? &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not what you have done, but it's what he's already done. &gt;&gt; Amen. THAT'S WHY HE SAID, "I'VE GIVEN YOU MY WORD." YOU DON'T JUST HAVE a have a a former age of a ministry IN THIS HOUR. YOU'VE GOT THE FINAL. YOU'VE GOT THE COMPLETE MINISTRY IN THIS HOUR. THE OPEN BOOK, A THIRD PULL MINISTRY. AMEN. CHURCH, WE'VE GOT TO BE LIVING ABOVE THE THINGS OF THIS WORLD. I'm preaching to myself this morning. AMEN. WE'VE GOT TO GIVE OUR EVERY CARE UNTO ALMIGHTY GOD. AMEN. LET HIM TAKE CONTROL OF OUR LIVES. &gt;&gt; That's his desire. &gt;&gt; Amen. When you feel stressed because we read this morning in everything by prayer with thanksgiving by prayer. What transpires when you praise through your pressure. &gt;&gt; Hey man, when they were sitting in the jail, I studied that many years ago. And and here was Paul and here was Silas and they're in the middle of the jail. And they they what they did in those days, they would they would whip their backs and they would put their backs onto the ground and so that the dirt would get into the wounds, it would cause infection to cause pain and suffering. But in that condition, they started to praise. &gt;&gt; AMEN. SOME I I I WON'T SAY this church, maybe I'll say this whatever, but you you people know how to praise. I love your worship services. I I love the entering in of the people. Amen. Because when you praise, Amen, through the pressures of life, your worship shifts the focus FROM YOUR STORM TO your savior. Amen. When you praise through the middle of the storm, AMEN. WHEN YOU PRAISE WHEN THINGS ARE DOWN, AMEN. WHEN YOU GIVE A SACRIFICE OF PRAISE, AMEN. AND SAY, "LORD, I DON'T FEEL LIKE IT THIS MORNING HOUR." AMEN. BUT I'M GOING TO PRAISE THE NAME OF THE LORD THIS MORNING. AMEN. REGARDLESS OF HOW I FEEL. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; We don't praise him enough. &gt;&gt; We don't thank him enough. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. We should praise him every day, every moment of the day. &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord, to be able to focus upon his word. Amen. When we praise him through our storm, it brings victory. Amen. We're to keep our mind stayed in the word. Amen. We got to keep our thoughts stabilized by the word. We have to have a thankful heart. Amen. Thankfulness disarms anxiety. &gt;&gt; Amen. When you're thankful, all your anxiety goes away. Hey, I come home. Sister Mart, how are you doing? I'm doing great. Amen. I say that all the time because I believe with all my heart. We were at a meeting and brother Calvin was there and he was speaking to the young people and here we had the same lines we used every day. We didn't even know it. He said," he said, "I feel great every day." People made me feel so great. I just feel great. Amen. I know Christ is with me. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's keeping me in in the in the line &gt;&gt; line of duty. Guard your mind. &gt;&gt; Don't fe Don't feed stress with overthinking. &gt;&gt; Feed peace with meditation on the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Guard your heart. You're never going to find peace in computer games. &gt;&gt; You'll find peace in the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Computer games will stress you out. &gt;&gt; I'm going home in a day, so you'll have the regulars back on next week. &gt;&gt; It's the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're never going to keep a home in order if one or the other is playing computer games all day long. &gt;&gt; No communication. &gt;&gt; You know what you have? You have a stressed out home. Everybody's stressed out. He's trying to get to another level. &gt;&gt; In the meantime, the kids are tearing it up. The wife is stressed out. Ask for free. &gt;&gt; Nobody gave me a pink note on the way in. &gt;&gt; We live in a in the lady of seeing age. &gt;&gt; It's full of confusion, fear, and instability. &gt;&gt; But God's bride is called to manifest calm assurance. We sing the song, "Mine, mine, mine. Jesus is mine. Mine when I'm weary, mine when I'm dreary. Amen. Is he yours all the moment of the day? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is the peace of God ruling in your heart and miss all the confusion of the world? I trust it is. If it isn't this morning, I would recommend that you would ask the peace of God to come into your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you need to lay anything down, this age is stressed. Nations are breaking. Economies are crumbling. Churches are stressed out. But somehow the bride walks in perfect harmony with the King of Kings. &gt;&gt; Amen. The revealed word of God that cannot fail in the hour we're living in. Amen. The bride knows who she is and who she belongs to. &gt;&gt; You may walk through a season where the load is heavy, but you're not walking alone. &gt;&gt; Amen. The same Christ who said peace be still to the sea can whisper the same to your heart. I say this morning hour let peace be your position. Let calmness be your confession. Amen. You may be stressed out but I say this morning give it to Jesus. &gt;&gt; In Romans 15:13 it says, "Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing that you may abound in hope through the power of the Holy Ghost." Right. &gt;&gt; In third Exodus, brother Bram says, "Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word." Tell me that one man can speak anything contrary to that and say it's the word of God when heavens and earth will pass away, but that word shall not. Faith finds the word sanctuary of rest. &gt;&gt; Amen. It moves right up on top that eternal rock, Christ Jesus, the word, and lays down there and rests. Let the winds howl. Let the storms shake. She is safe evermore. She rests right there on that word. That's where faith, genuine Christian faith rests. Resting place is the word. For it knows that God will ever prove himself superior over everyone. Let's say everyone. &gt;&gt; Every one of his enemies. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you believe that? Amen. &gt;&gt; I say if you need to cast down in Jesus name every imagination, pull down every lie of the devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. It doesn't matter. Somebody said this or somebody says that. I &gt;&gt; It doesn't really matter. You say, "Well, I can't serve God because of so and so." No, you got to get Christ in your heart because it's not between you and so and so. &gt;&gt; It's between you and Jesus Christ personally. &gt;&gt; Amen. Allow Christ to come in your heart to the fullest extent. Amen. Walk in peace. Walk in power. Walk in perfect clarity of the message of the hour. Amen. Last scripture I want to leave with you is second Timothy 1:7. For God hath not given us a spirit of fear, but of power. Let's say power &gt;&gt; and of love and a sound mind. It's going to be this year for sister, myself, and our daughter Melody that our son-in-law My passed away 12 years ago coming up here just in a couple of days. It was an incredible time of stress and it was a credible time where we had to learn to lean on Jesus Christ. Amen. But God through it all kept us in the way. Amen. It doesn't matter what the circumstances or what it is. This scripture kept our heart and our minds fixed on God. We did not look at our circumstance. We did not I know what I'm preaching this morning. We did not look at our circumstances. We did not look on woe is me and and and too bad for me. You know, we looked at the word of God that God has a perfect plan. &gt;&gt; Amen. And his perfect plan should bring peace to the heart of a believing person. Amen. Especially to a bride member. Amen. Of the message of the hour. Amen. We we say all the time, God is in control. And if he's in control, let him be in control. &gt;&gt; Amen. And let the peace of God fill you with all of his joy in serving him. Amen. because it's an honor and it's a joy to serve the living God. &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't know if we know know this song. Uh it's a song that that that we sing at home sometimes and maybe brother Andrew can help me sing it. Going up yonder. Do you know that song? Could we sing that song this morning? It looks like you all know the song real well. I can't sing it. I I know I know brother Andrew is saying he's going to have his turn to sing up up when we get to the other side. I'm going to have my turn my turn too. Amen. But I don't know how it's going to going to sound like, but I'm not going to worry about it when I'm up there. Amen. I'm going to say, "Lord, give me some of the ability of some of these singing people." Amen. But why don't we sing that together this morning going up yonder. Amen. Let the peace of God rule in your heart. Let stress don't don't be stressed out. You find stress coming on you, take it in control immediately. Amen. Garnish it. Take it like a prisoner and take it and cast it down. and say, "I'm not going to let stress rule my life today." &gt;&gt; Amen. But I'm going to let Jesus Christ, the word of God, rule rule in my heart. You love the Lord this morning. Give him a good hand clap and praise this morning. We love you with all of our heart, with all of our mind, all of our soul. Amen. God bless you. Bless you. Thank you. God bless you. If you want to know where I'm going, where I'm going, oh, one day soon. Oh, if anybody ask you where I'm going where I'm going for one day soon. Just tell them for me I'm going up yonder. I'm going up yonder. Oh, I'm going up yonder to be with my Lord. Oh, I'm going in rapture. I'm going in rapture. Oh, I'm going in rapture. Going to be with my Lord. Oh, I can take the pain, the heartache that life brings, the comfort in knowing, I'll soon be gone. Oh, as God gives me grace, I'll run this Christian race until I see my Savior. I see him face to face. Oh, I'm going up yonder. I'm going up yonder. I'm going up yonder. Be with my Lord. I'm going in the rapture. I'm going in the rapture. I'm going in the rapture to be with my Lord. Oh, I can take the pain. Oh, the heartache that life brings. The comfort in knowing I'll soon be gone. As God gives me grace, I'm going to see him. I see you face to face. I'm resting on that. Oh, I'm going up yonder. I'm going up yonder. I'm going up yonder to be with my Lord. You are God alone from before time began. You are on your throne. And you are God alone. And right now and right now in the good times and bad. You were on your throne and you are God alone. You're the only God whose power none can contain. You're the only God whose name is praise and remembering. You're the only God who's worthy of everything we can give. You are God and that's just the way it is. For you are God alone from before time began. Oh, you were on your throne and you are God alone. And right now in the good times and bad you were on your throne and you are God alone. You're unchangeable, unshakeable, unstoppable. Oh, that's what you are. You're unchangeable. You're unchangeable, unshakeable. You're unstoppable. Oh, that's what you are. For you are God alone. From before time began for you were on your throne. You are God alone. Right now in the good times and you were on your throne and you are God alone. How many could say that Jesus spoke to you today? Amen. &gt;&gt; How many could say Jesus spoke to him today &gt;&gt; in these words? Walking in peace in a stressful world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I know it might be just a little bit crowded, but if you'd like to come up for prayer this morning, cuz I know I know how special this service is this morning, and I don't want you to miss your moment, cuz Jesus ain't stressed out by the storm. Amen. Oh, crossing the calm scenes of Jesus, the disciples were getting concerned. The wind started violently blowing, but he was asleep in the storm. Does he not care that we perish? We are helpless and we're so afraid. Jesus arose when they call him. Said to them, "Where is your faith?" Because you pray all night cuz you held on with all your might.
