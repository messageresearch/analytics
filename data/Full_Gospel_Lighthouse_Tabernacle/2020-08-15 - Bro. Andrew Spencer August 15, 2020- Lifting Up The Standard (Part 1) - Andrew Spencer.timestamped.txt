[0:59] when moses brought the children out to
[1:01] all those that followed him

[1:08] when they come out of the red sea and

[1:12] the wilderness god came down
[1:15] upon mount sinai that pillar fire set
[1:18] the whole mountain on fire
[1:19] and a boy spoke out of there god gave
[1:22] the 10 commandments
[1:24] moses could have walked up there before
[1:25] the people and say this day
[1:27] the scripture that i have told you as
[1:29] his prophet
[1:30] comes to pass this day i've told you
[1:34] that god
[1:35] bet me and not buried a burning bush in
[1:37] a pillar farm
[1:38] and he said this oh this will be a sign
[1:42] you'll bring them people right back to
[1:44] this place here again and there is
[1:46] god in the same pillar of far i told you
[1:48] that hanging right there on the mountain
[1:51] this day this prophecy is fulfilled
[1:55] here he is to vindicate that the things
[1:57] i've said
[1:58] is the truth god give us more man like
[2:00] that that's honest and sincere and tell
[2:03] the truth
[2:04] that god almighty could vindicate that
[2:06] his word is still true
[2:09] he remains the same yesterday ever why
[2:11] wouldn't he do it
[2:12] he promised to do it joshua he might
[2:15] have said the same
[2:17] the day that he come back to
[2:20] katie sparnia where they had journeyed
[2:23] so far in the wilderness
[2:24] they were doubting the land being the
[2:26] kind of land
[2:27] that god said it would be but god told
[2:29] them it was a good language
[2:30] he was born with milk and honey and
[2:33] joshua and caleb was the only two that
[2:35] would believe it
[2:36] out of the other 10 that left when they
[2:38] come back
[2:39] they had the evidence they had a bunch
[2:42] of grapes
[2:43] that too strong men could only carry
[2:46] joshua and caleb stood right there and
[2:48] said this day
[2:50] this scripture is fulfilled here's the
[2:53] evidence that it is a good land
[2:56] sure why there's the evidence that it's
[2:59] a good land
[3:00] words you ever get such things as that
[3:02] in egypt there was no such places
[3:05] but this day this scripture is fulfilled
[3:08] he could have said the thing same when
[3:11] he prophesied
[3:12] and said the walls of jericho would fall
[3:14] down after they marched around seven
[3:16] times
[3:17] seven days seven times a day and when
[3:20] they marched around that last time
[3:21] the walls fell down josh away
[3:25] go to step and said this
[3:28] day the chief captain of the host of the
[3:31] lord
[3:32] that told me weeks ago that it would
[3:34] happen like this this day this scripture
[3:36] is fulfilled
[3:38] i leave the walls flat on the ground
[3:39] come on let's go take it it belongs to
[3:41] us
[3:42] this day this scripture is fulfilled
[3:45] how wonderful man of god has stood for
[3:48] the things that's right
[3:50] israel at the river when they possess
[3:53] the land
[3:54] went over how they going to do it it's a
[3:56] month of april
[3:58] the floods are coming down because the
[3:59] snow was melting up in judea
[4:01] oh what a poor uh general it seemed like
[4:04] it god was
[4:05] to bring these people there in the month
[4:07] of april when the jordan is higher back
[4:09] than it ever was
[4:10] sometimes i might could stop here if i
[4:12] had time to give you just a little
[4:14] tip sometimes you may be studying either
[4:16] with cancer you might be studying with a
[4:17] disease
[4:18] you think why me being a christian would
[4:20] be in this way
[4:22] why would i be sitting like this if i'm
[4:24] a christian sometimes god lets the
[4:26] things get so
[4:26] dark that you can't see up around or
[4:28] anywhere else then he comes and makes a
[4:30] way through it
[4:32] she might say this day this scripture is
[4:35] being fulfilled
[4:36] that he promised to do he let the hebrew
[4:39] children walk right into the fiery
[4:40] furnace
[4:41] they said our god is able to deliver us
[4:43] in as far as the furnace but
[4:44] nevertheless we'll not bow down to your
[4:46] image
[4:47] when they walk down there at the smell
[4:48] that furnace upon them no smell will
[4:50] furnish rather upon them
[4:51] they could have said this thing is this
[4:53] scripture fulfilled
[4:55] daniel come from the lines then he could
[4:57] have said the same thing
[4:59] john the baptist after 400 years of
[5:02] ecclesiastical
[5:03] teaching no one of that church was in a
[5:06] mess at that time
[5:07] when he appeared in the wilderness of
[5:08] georgia he just stood right down the
[5:10] bank as he did
[5:12] and say this day this picture isaiah
[5:15] party
[5:16] is fulfilled how i could stop here and
[5:19] tell you what the old priest told me
[5:20] said son
[5:21] you never finished that message i said
[5:23] keep still he said you mean that
[5:24] pentecostals don't see that i said no he
[5:26] said i said
[5:27] and a catholic preached he said why
[5:30] didn't you go and i said keep still
[5:32] he said glory to god i see it and about
[5:35] that time the holy ghost fell on his
[5:37] sister sitting out there in a meeting
[5:38] and she raised up speaking in unknowing
[5:41] tongues and gave the interpretation of
[5:42] the very thing
[5:43] that the priest and i were talking about
[5:45] on the platform
[5:46] the old church the whole face went into
[5:49] a door
[5:51] the old robbers convention last week or
[5:53] week before last it was the talk of the
[5:54] convention
[5:56] how did that priest say that the holy
[5:57] spirit revealed out there
[5:59] to a woman his sister i believe it was
[6:01] and what was taking place up there
[6:02] on the platform and revealed that thing
[6:06] that we were hiding
[6:08] [Music]
[6:11] the hour that we're living this day this
[6:13] picture is fulfilled
[6:15] this day the evening lights have come
[6:19] and we fail to see it notice john said
[6:22] this day
[6:23] i am the voice of one crying in the
[6:26] wilderness
[6:27] that said the prophet isaiah prepare the
[6:29] way for the lord
[6:31] they didn't understand said oh you're
[6:32] jesus you're the christ rather
[6:35] he said i am not the christ he said i'm
[6:37] not worthy to lose his shoes
[6:39] but he said he's standing among you
[6:41] somewhere
[6:42] or he was sure that he would be there
[6:46] he'd be in his day because god
[6:48] told him he was to introduce the messiah
[6:50] one day a young man's come walking down
[6:52] to the
[6:52] scene uh like a light over the top of
[6:55] him aside
[6:56] and he cried out behold the lamb of god
[6:58] this
[6:59] day this scripture is fulfilled before
[7:02] you
[7:02] sure at the day of pentecost how
[7:06] peter stood up and quoted the scripture
[7:08] of joel 2 38
[7:10] when they was all laughing those people
[7:11] they couldn't talk in their own language
[7:13] they were jabbering off something else
[7:14] the bible said cloven tongues cloven is
[7:17] a party tongue not saying nothing
[7:19] just a jabber and running around like a
[7:20] bunch of drunk people they all said well
[7:22] these people are drunk look at them
[7:24] look how they're acting how they have
[7:26] women and men they're disorderly
[7:27] said that religious group of that day
[7:30] peter stood up in the midst of him
[7:32] said any brethren you that dwell in
[7:35] jerusalem and you that dwell in judea
[7:37] let it be known unto you that these are
[7:39] not drunk as you suppose seeing it's the
[7:41] third hour today
[7:42] but this is that which is spoken by the
[7:45] prophet joel it'll come to pass in the
[7:47] last days
[7:48] uh pour out my spirit upon old flesh
[7:51] this day
[7:52] this scripture was fulfilled certainly
[7:55] luther was right on time wesley was
[7:58] right on time
[8:00] pentecost was right on time nothing
[8:03] out of the order now i asked you
[8:06] to consider the age and time
[8:09] we now live in with the promised word

[52:27] in the midst of the chaos of this world
[52:29] we have a north star that is
[52:31] leading us on the way amen god bless you
[52:34] can be seated this evening in the
[52:36] presence of the lord we
[52:38] we certainly counted an awesome honor to
[52:41] to be here this evening and to thank the
[52:44] lord for the good news that we've heard
[52:45] this week
[52:47] and we just can't thank the lord enough
[52:50] dad got some really good reports and i
[52:52] believe the
[52:53] uh sister whitney or or the team there
[52:57] on the church facebook had sent out some
[52:59] things and
[53:00] i've had people ask me where where do we
[53:02] look for the best
[53:04] the best news and either come across
[53:07] this pulpit or we'll put it on the
[53:08] facebook we have control of that
[53:10] so so we know what's getting put out
[53:12] we've you can't imagine what we've heard
[53:16] brother ron looks pretty good for being
[53:18] on hospice don't he
[53:21] you can't imagine what we've heard so so
[53:24] we thank you for
[53:25] being mindful of the right news and
[53:28] and getting it right from the horse's
[53:30] mouth and but we're certainly privileged
[53:33] to be able to witness the hand of our
[53:35] lord
[53:36] and what we're seeing is nothing else
[53:38] than than our lord
[53:39] at work and he got some really good news
[53:44] the doctors were just testifying to us
[53:46] of what
[53:47] we already knew was coming the doctor
[53:50] said that there was no new lesions in
[53:52] the bl
[53:52] in the brain or in the lungs and they
[53:55] actually said that the
[53:57] that what it looked like now they're
[53:58] waiting on the final readings but it
[54:00] looked like scar
[54:01] tissue in his lungs so we just give the
[54:05] lord thanks for that
[54:11] so we're waiting on words from them
[54:15] on cancer free those are the words we're
[54:17] wanting to hear
[54:18] and when we get on that side of it we're
[54:20] still going to pray
[54:22] and we'll get three months past those
[54:24] words we're still going to pray because
[54:26] we know the enemy hates us and

[1:03:27] on lifting lifting up the standard
[1:03:32] lifting up the standard isaiah chapter
[1:03:35] 59 and verse 19
[1:03:37] and just thank the lord for the
[1:03:39] opportunity to be able to lift his name
[1:03:41] on high
[1:03:44] this week my my little girl ally
[1:03:47] uh just five years old and i believe
[1:03:50] she's five now
[1:03:51] they're correct six and see things
[1:03:54] growing up on me so
[1:03:55] so fast i can't hardly keep up
[1:04:00] covett had a good thing of messing
[1:04:02] everybody's calendars up
[1:04:04] and uh but she was
[1:04:07] she was praying praying over our
[1:04:10] breakfast
[1:04:11] one day this week and she began to pray
[1:04:14] and she said thank you god
[1:04:16] for giving us pawpaw back from cancer
[1:04:20] amen
[1:04:23] thank you god for giving us paul paul
[1:04:25] back from cancer
[1:04:27] jesus took it back
[1:04:30] amen amen isaiah chapter 59
[1:04:34] and verse 19 and so shall they fear the
[1:04:38] name of the lord from the west
[1:04:41] and his glory from the rising of the sun
[1:04:45] and when the enemy shall come in like a
[1:04:47] flood
[1:04:48] the spirit of the lord shall lift up a
[1:04:51] standard
[1:04:52] can we say that together lift up a
[1:04:54] standard
[1:04:56] against him when the enemy shall come in
[1:04:59] like a flood the spirit of the lord
[1:05:01] shall lift up a standard against him
[1:05:03] if you have a scofield bible flip back
[1:05:05] about five pages over to isaiah chapter
[1:05:08] 53 verse three
[1:05:16] the bible says here that he is
[1:05:20] despised and rejected of men a man of
[1:05:24] sorrows and acquainted with grief
[1:05:26] and we hid as it were our faces from him
[1:05:30] he was despised and we esteemed him not
[1:05:34] surely he hath borne our griefs and
[1:05:36] carried our sorrows yet we did esteem
[1:05:38] him
[1:05:39] stricken smitten of god and afflicted
[1:05:42] he was wounded for our transgressions
[1:05:45] he was bruised for our iniquities the
[1:05:48] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[1:05:51] and with his stripes we are
[1:05:59] and with his stripes we are
[1:06:02] healed may god bless his word he may be
[1:06:05] seated
[1:06:06] in the presence of the lord this evening
[1:06:08] so he said we'd like to speak to you
[1:06:10] on on lifting lifting up
[1:06:13] the standard a standard is a
[1:06:16] is a symbol as a symbol that is carried
[1:06:19] on a pole when it's raised high in the
[1:06:21] air
[1:06:22] and it's the standard is much like a
[1:06:25] flag
[1:06:26] in which a a in it's much like a flag to
[1:06:30] rally a tribe
[1:06:32] or a group of warriors in battle
[1:06:35] you see the standard or ensigns were
[1:06:37] most likely like
[1:06:38] carvings in the old testament were were
[1:06:41] probably like carvings or likenesses of
[1:06:43] animals raised on a pole and they would
[1:06:46] take that standard and they would
[1:06:48] they would set it up on a hill so that
[1:06:50] all the tribes
[1:06:51] would sit there and maybe one day will
[1:06:54] go into those things of those different
[1:06:55] tribes in the head of those tribes of
[1:06:57] of each of those of those banners that
[1:07:00] was lifted up there but that
[1:07:01] that ensign it was a flag or a banner or
[1:07:05] of a military band and a band of a
[1:07:08] banner of colors
[1:07:10] and of a standard and we we all know
[1:07:13] that
[1:07:14] if we're very familiar here in the south
[1:07:16] of being acquainted with the civil war
[1:07:18] we're aware
[1:07:19] of things that that that we're
[1:07:21] acquainted with because of this valley
[1:07:23] and because of the history that is here
[1:07:26] that we know that there were those men
[1:07:28] in in the battle that were called
[1:07:30] standard bearers and those those bearers
[1:07:33] would take the standard or the flag and
[1:07:35] they would
[1:07:36] they would bear that flag wherever they
[1:07:38] would go and maybe you know the term of
[1:07:40] it called the color guard and
[1:07:42] that color guard was was protected by a
[1:07:44] personal guard
[1:07:46] and you see that that color guard or the
[1:07:48] standard bearer was
[1:07:49] always his job was always to lift the
[1:07:52] standard
[1:07:54] it was always to put the standard before
[1:07:56] the people that was his job was
[1:07:58] to make sure that he lifted the standard
[1:08:01] and those
[1:08:01] and those guards were there that if that
[1:08:03] that standard bearer got
[1:08:05] shot that the guards would grab that
[1:08:07] standard and they would lift it up
[1:08:09] because
[1:08:10] you see it's it's a great morale for the
[1:08:12] people and the company
[1:08:14] of the army when they begin to see their
[1:08:16] flag or they begin to see that standard
[1:08:18] that is lifted before them
[1:08:20] and you see the purpose of a standard
[1:08:22] bearer was to give
[1:08:24] the unit's member a visual signal as to
[1:08:27] where the unit was
[1:08:28] and if in the course of a fight you were
[1:08:31] separated from your unit
[1:08:33] and one looked around until you saw that
[1:08:36] standard and then tried to get back
[1:08:38] close to it so you can imagine as if
[1:08:40] maybe you're
[1:08:41] fighting in in the battle you're right
[1:08:43] in the middle of the civil war and
[1:08:44] you're
[1:08:44] you're fighting and you've been fighting
[1:08:46] and you've you you've taken your bayonet
[1:08:48] and you've taken your gun
[1:08:50] and you you've shot every round that you
[1:08:52] could and you're fighting
[1:08:54] in in your own little circle and you
[1:08:56] can't you can't really find
[1:08:58] where everybody else is in the battle so
[1:09:00] your eyes hit the horizon
[1:09:03] and they look out on the horizon and
[1:09:04] they're looking for that standard
[1:09:07] and you see the standard bearer was
[1:09:10] normally was in close proximity to the
[1:09:12] leader of the unit
[1:09:14] so so if we would if we would see that
[1:09:16] general lee was
[1:09:17] uh was leading out so we would see that
[1:09:20] that standard bearer was
[1:09:21] very close or or whoever the general was
[1:09:24] or however the leader was they were real
[1:09:26] close by
[1:09:28] and though they they were they're very
[1:09:30] closely
[1:09:31] placed in a placement of where
[1:09:34] they wanted to lead the charge in and
[1:09:37] the placement of those
[1:09:39] regimental flags served as a visual
[1:09:42] as a communication during civil war
[1:09:44] battles
[1:09:45] as you can imagine if somebody would
[1:09:47] shout out we're going over here
[1:09:49] or we're leading this way or or the
[1:09:51] confederates were hit it this way
[1:09:53] but you see in the midst of battle when
[1:09:55] they're in the midst of a ray
[1:09:56] of bullets flying around them and vocal
[1:09:59] commands and bugle calls would not be
[1:10:01] have heard
[1:10:02] so they were looking for that standard
[1:10:04] that was going before them because in
[1:10:06] the midst of that noisy battlefield they
[1:10:08] could not
[1:10:09] see or could not hear where they were
[1:10:11] going so the soldier was trained to look
[1:10:14] for that standard
[1:10:15] and you see when the standard bearer
[1:10:18] when whenever the standard bearer would
[1:10:20] go and retreat
[1:10:21] the whole the whole company would run in
[1:10:24] in retreat
[1:10:25] they would they would go wherever that
[1:10:27] standard would go
[1:10:29] i want you to know this this evening
[1:10:32] that the standard of god has never went
[1:10:34] in retreat
[1:10:35] but it's always went forward and god's
[1:10:38] children do not back up
[1:10:40] and they don't give in and they don't
[1:10:42] back off of his promises but
[1:10:44] the standard of god is always before
[1:10:47] them
[1:10:47] and when now when the standard fell
[1:10:51] when the flag fell the unit members did
[1:10:53] not have a visual rallying point to go
[1:10:55] around or
[1:10:56] to go and to go to and just for
[1:11:00] just for giving you these things a loss
[1:11:02] of a standard in battle
[1:11:04] was considered to be one of the worst
[1:11:06] things to happen
[1:11:09] you see it was it was one of the worst
[1:11:11] things to lose your flack
[1:11:12] it was it meant that the honor of the
[1:11:16] unit was lost
[1:11:19] so it's an amazing thing to keep the
[1:11:21] standard
[1:11:23] it's an amazing thing to keep your eyes
[1:11:26] on the standard
[1:11:27] it's an amazing thing to know that you
[1:11:30] do not want to lose the standard
[1:11:32] and notice this also that capturing a
[1:11:35] standard
[1:11:36] by an opponent was considered to be
[1:11:38] tremendous
[1:11:40] a tremendous act of courage so we know
[1:11:43] that by reading
[1:11:44] history and by reading history books
[1:11:46] that there were specific men that were
[1:11:48] sent
[1:11:49] out in battles that would go out and
[1:11:51] they would try to take
[1:11:52] that standard or steal that standard or
[1:11:56] shoot down that standard bearer and they
[1:11:58] would go over and try to take that
[1:12:00] standard
[1:12:01] because it would show an act of courage
[1:12:04] on behalf of the army
[1:12:06] and so you see that you can imagine as
[1:12:08] is as if they were going out after this
[1:12:10] flag
[1:12:11] there's a lot of pride in this area of
[1:12:14] flying the confederate flag around here
[1:12:16] but you can imagine as some of as some
[1:12:18] of the the boys here in the valley
[1:12:21] and they're fighting and somebody on the
[1:12:23] union side
[1:12:24] comes in and they want to steal that
[1:12:27] flag
[1:12:28] and they're trying to come in that would
[1:12:29] be that would be considered
[1:12:32] considered an act of courage that they
[1:12:35] would go in
[1:12:36] and try to do those things in the same
[1:12:37] way vice versa going in and getting the
[1:12:39] union flag or the regiment flag
[1:12:42] but you know i can maybe put it to you
[1:12:44] in scriptural terms
[1:12:46] you see goliath was the philistine
[1:12:49] standard and that standard was set out
[1:12:52] in a valley one day and
[1:12:54] and they they lifted it up before the
[1:12:56] people and that
[1:12:57] that that standard was out there
[1:12:59] screaming for 40 days
[1:13:01] send us out a man down here and come and
[1:13:04] send me a man that'll fight with us
[1:13:06] but when david heard of these things in
[1:13:08] his courage
[1:13:10] he slipped down into the valley and said
[1:13:12] i'm going to go down and i'm going to
[1:13:14] steal that standard
[1:13:16] i'm going to take down the enemy
[1:13:18] standard and what did david do he went
[1:13:21] down there and he captured that standard
[1:13:23] when he took that standard's head off he
[1:13:25] lifted that standard up
[1:13:27] with the sword of goliath and he looked
[1:13:30] back
[1:13:31] at all the armies of israel and said
[1:13:34] boys
[1:13:34] you can come on all the way i've already
[1:13:37] taken down their standard
[1:13:39] i've already taken away their honor you
[1:13:41] see they were comfortable and
[1:13:43] as long as goliath was out there but
[1:13:45] when goliath got his head taken off
[1:13:48] they were no longer comfortable standing
[1:13:50] in the fight
[1:13:51] and i want you to know that the devil is
[1:13:53] not comfortable
[1:13:54] because when jesus christ took the hill
[1:13:57] on galgotha
[1:13:58] you see he stripped the standard of hell
[1:14:01] and he took away the standard of hell
[1:14:04] when he took death out of the way he
[1:14:06] stripped all the honor from hell
[1:14:09] and hell has no honor left to it because
[1:14:12] death has been defeated the standard of
[1:14:14] hell has no honor
[1:14:17] it has no honor because the standard
[1:14:21] of hell has been taken hallelujah
[1:14:25] he came and he took the standard away
[1:14:27] from them and so
[1:14:28] all you know today is that satan and all
[1:14:31] the demons of hell
[1:14:33] all they are is a bunch of windbacks
[1:14:35] because they have no power
[1:14:37] they have no authority because the
[1:14:39] prophet told me
[1:14:40] that when jesus christ took calvary he
[1:14:43] stripped every power
[1:14:45] every authority every bit that the devil
[1:14:48] had
[1:14:48] jesus christ came and he took it all the
[1:14:51] way
[1:14:52] from the devil it was an act of courage
[1:14:56] when jesus went up on the cross and he
[1:14:59] looked
[1:14:59] back to all the armies of israel and
[1:15:02] said we can take all of it
[1:15:05] just follow me we can take all of it
[1:15:11] you see it was a soldier that soldier
[1:15:14] takes great deal of pride in those flags
[1:15:21] there's a lot of people that don't
[1:15:23] appreciate
[1:15:24] this american flag
[1:15:27] but i got a great deal of pride in
[1:15:29] myself still
[1:15:31] i'm still thankful for the red white and
[1:15:33] blue
[1:15:35] i'm still thankful for this nation
[1:15:38] it seems like it's in a disarray but
[1:15:40] there's still a lot of pride left in me
[1:15:43] [Applause]
[1:15:45] i'm with her in her glory and i'm with
[1:15:48] her in her shame
[1:15:50] and when those men when those those
[1:15:52] battle flags were coming back
[1:15:54] you see those men were watching that
[1:15:56] flag and those men always
[1:15:58] watched they watched that flag and they
[1:16:01] treated that flag with reverence
[1:16:04] because it lifted a standard to them
[1:16:08] you see when men were fighting over
[1:16:11] in world war one and world war ii when
[1:16:14] they seen that flag they could look at
[1:16:16] that flag
[1:16:18] and it was a standard for them it was a
[1:16:20] rallying point for them and they would
[1:16:22] look at that flag
[1:16:23] and they could look at that flag and
[1:16:25] they would realize that
[1:16:27] back in that homeland there's a family
[1:16:29] there that i'm fighting for
[1:16:31] there's a land that i'm fighting for
[1:16:33] that we could be free
[1:16:35] now notice in the inside the prophet
[1:16:37] said that god appropriated the ensign
[1:16:40] and god gives you something to hold on
[1:16:42] to
[1:16:43] an insight like a flag hanging and in
[1:16:45] korea and all down in the
[1:16:47] islands during the time of the war when
[1:16:49] the americans
[1:16:50] had drove back the japanese and they run
[1:16:53] up in guam in different places
[1:16:55] to the top of the hill the highest hill
[1:16:57] that they could find
[1:16:58] and there with tears running down their
[1:17:00] cheeks with with shouts they
[1:17:02] they planted the american flag oh glory
[1:17:05] above the hillside and they
[1:17:07] they conquered the land and and what an
[1:17:09] achievement it was to lift up that
[1:17:11] ensign
[1:17:12] and say that this belongs to us
[1:17:17] and oh what a privilege it was for those
[1:17:19] soldiers
[1:17:25] to stand there on the land that they had
[1:17:28] conquered
[1:17:30] he said i tell you that god gave the
[1:17:32] church an ensign one day
[1:17:34] when jesus was lifted up on calvary
[1:17:37] between heavens and earth
[1:17:38] and none other god emmanuel bleeding out
[1:17:41] his blood upon the ground
[1:17:42] and there was an ensign lifted up to the
[1:17:46] people that we have conquered
[1:17:48] we have we are more than conquerors be
[1:17:51] he
[1:17:51] because he conquered it for us
[1:17:55] when those men were the americans when
[1:17:57] they were taking the island
[1:17:58] of iwo jima and they were there and they
[1:18:01] were in the midst of battle
[1:18:03] and they were looking at the battle and
[1:18:05] the japanese were all afraid
[1:18:08] and they were in caves and there was
[1:18:10] much warfare that was going on
[1:18:12] there was some men that was bearing a
[1:18:14] standard and said it's time
[1:18:16] that we lift the standard over this
[1:18:19] place
[1:18:20] and say that we have conquered this land
[1:18:23] and when they climbed up that hill they
[1:18:25] were getting shot at
[1:18:27] when they climbed up that hill they was
[1:18:29] going willing to give their life
[1:18:31] just to put the standard on the top of
[1:18:34] that hill
[1:18:35] because they knew that they were going
[1:18:37] to win that battle
[1:18:40] but i love what i love about this story
[1:18:43] is that they didn't just do it once they
[1:18:46] did it twice
[1:18:48] they climbed up there first with a small
[1:18:50] flag and the boy said that's not good
[1:18:52] enough we need to put a big one up there
[1:18:54] so they went back to their ships and
[1:18:56] they got himself a good
[1:18:58] old-sized one so that everybody that was
[1:19:01] on the seaside
[1:19:02] and everybody that was on the shore
[1:19:04] could see that this standard
[1:19:06] was flying up there you see adam
[1:19:09] there was a covenant made for adam when
[1:19:11] he walked out
[1:19:12] when he walked out of the garden of eden
[1:19:15] showing it took the blood
[1:19:16] but god said that's not good enough i'm
[1:19:19] gonna hang my son
[1:19:20] up there so that it shows a sign to all
[1:19:23] the world
[1:19:24] that i have conquered this land
[1:19:28] and satan tonight knows that when every
[1:19:31] son and daughter of god
[1:19:32] has placed that sign that token of the
[1:19:35] holy ghost
[1:19:36] upon their life that satan knows
[1:19:40] that this land has already been
[1:19:42] conquered and already been paid for
[1:19:44] by almighty god
[1:19:51] i want to tell satan you can't take our
[1:19:52] flag
[1:19:55] you can't take our standard
[1:19:57] [Music]
[1:19:58] we're waving this standard of the word
[1:20:00] we're carrying it high
[1:20:02] and satan can't take it
[1:20:08] hallelujah
[1:20:11] hallelujah you see if you let the holy
[1:20:14] ghost go to control in your life
[1:20:17] go to controlling your soul and
[1:20:18] controlling your spirit
[1:20:20] and all the five realms of your of your
[1:20:22] flesh
[1:20:23] a seed tastes feel and smell if you go
[1:20:26] to let him
[1:20:27] working in your life and washing out
[1:20:29] your memory
[1:20:30] and and begin to move in your life
[1:20:32] you'll watch
[1:20:34] that you are now packing the image of
[1:20:37] the standard
[1:20:40] you're packing everything that he is
[1:20:43] you see because you're packing his own
[1:20:46] life hallelujah
[1:20:52] hallelujah
[1:20:56] turn with me over to exodus chapter 17
[1:20:58] and verse 8.
[1:21:03] hallelujah do you love the lord tonight
[1:21:09] the bible says here in exodus 17-8
[1:21:13] then came amalek and fought with israel
[1:21:15] and referred them
[1:21:16] and moses said unto joshua choose out
[1:21:19] choose us
[1:21:20] out men and go out and fight with amalek
[1:21:22] tomorrow and i will stand on the top of
[1:21:24] the hill
[1:21:25] with the rod of god in my hand so joshua
[1:21:28] did as moses had said to him
[1:21:30] and fought with amalek and moses and her
[1:21:33] aaron and her
[1:21:34] went up to the top of the hill and it
[1:21:37] came to pass that when moses held up his
[1:21:39] hand
[1:21:40] that israel prevailed and when he let
[1:21:42] down his hand
[1:21:43] amalek prevailed but moses's hands
[1:21:47] were heavy and they took a stone and put
[1:21:49] it under him and he sat there on and
[1:21:51] aaron and her
[1:21:52] stayed up his hands they one on their
[1:21:55] one side and one on the other side
[1:21:58] and his hands were steady until the
[1:22:00] going down of the sun
[1:22:02] and joshua discomforted amalek and his
[1:22:04] people
[1:22:05] with the edge of the sword and the lord
[1:22:08] said unto moses write for
[1:22:09] this write this for a memorial in a book
[1:22:13] and rehearse it in the ears of joshua
[1:22:15] for i will utterly put out the
[1:22:17] remembrance of amalek
[1:22:19] from under heaven and moses built an
[1:22:22] altar
[1:22:23] and called the name of it jehovah
[1:22:26] jehovah nisi the name
[1:22:30] jehovah nesi it means jehovah
[1:22:34] that he is yahweh he is the
[1:22:37] self-existing one the true god
[1:22:40] but niecy means the true banner under
[1:22:43] which
[1:22:44] victory is certain
[1:22:48] you see joshua is going down into a
[1:22:51] valley
[1:22:52] he's going down into this valley and he
[1:22:54] don't understand
[1:22:56] that he's going down through there and
[1:22:58] he knows that moses said i'm going to be
[1:23:00] up there on that hill
[1:23:01] that i'm going to be that standard i'm
[1:23:03] going to stand up there with the
[1:23:05] rod of god in my hand and joshua was
[1:23:08] just fighting away
[1:23:09] but joshua don't know why the battle
[1:23:12] keeps going this way
[1:23:14] and why it keeps going that way he don't
[1:23:16] understand
[1:23:17] he don't understand that when moses is
[1:23:20] lifting up his hands
[1:23:21] he's winning he's prevailing but when
[1:23:24] his hands are hanging down low
[1:23:26] then the amalekites are prevailing over
[1:23:28] them
[1:23:29] so many times you've been in a fight
[1:23:32] you've been in a fight and it seems like
[1:23:33] man of life
[1:23:34] i'm tearing every devil up in hell
[1:23:38] and then sometimes you're going through
[1:23:40] a battle and it feels like my
[1:23:42] lord they're whipping me all over the
[1:23:44] place
[1:23:47] you see there was somebody that was
[1:23:49] lifting your hands up
[1:23:51] there was somebody that was lifting your
[1:23:53] hands up in prayer
[1:23:55] saying hey look over there lord jesus
[1:23:58] my brother and my sisters in the midst
[1:24:00] of pain would you go and meet
[1:24:02] them and it feels like you're getting
[1:24:05] you're getting whipped one day and all
[1:24:07] of a sudden there comes a charge of the
[1:24:09] holy ghost over top of you
[1:24:11] and you just square up on the devil and
[1:24:13] you kick him right in the teeth
[1:24:16] it's somebody lifting you up
[1:24:19] you're seeing joshua didn't understand
[1:24:21] what was going on down here
[1:24:23] but you see all those up there where the
[1:24:26] standard was
[1:24:27] was realizing what was taking place they
[1:24:29] were watching the battle down there
[1:24:33] they watched as moses held his hand up
[1:24:37] they were winning and they watched when
[1:24:39] the hand went down
[1:24:40] that they they began to prevail the
[1:24:43] enemy began to prevail
[1:24:45] over top of the children of israel
[1:24:48] i will say this to you church somebody
[1:24:50] might have to get me a seat
[1:24:52] somebody might have to give me a seat
[1:24:53] and let me sit down
[1:24:55] and somebody might have to hold up his
[1:24:56] hand and hold up that hand
[1:24:58] but i'm going to stay there until you
[1:25:01] get complete victory
[1:25:04] you look at your loved one and you look
[1:25:06] at your family say i'm going to have a
[1:25:08] camping party
[1:25:09] and i'm going to stay right here until
[1:25:12] you get this thing settled out
[1:25:15] you know the holy ghost is watching over
[1:25:17] top of you
[1:25:19] he's got your hands lifted up
[1:25:22] when you don't feel him he's there when
[1:25:24] you don't see him he's there
[1:25:28] he's got you in battle he's got you in
[1:25:30] good times
[1:25:34] here the israelites were fighting under
[1:25:37] the direction of god
[1:25:39] and in the defense of his truth you see
[1:25:41] the name of jehovah
[1:25:43] became the armored bearing of the whole
[1:25:46] congregation
[1:25:47] and by his direction they fought and in
[1:25:50] his name
[1:25:51] and strife they conquered
[1:25:54] it was because jehovah was on their side
[1:25:57] is while they were winning
[1:25:59] are you with me it's not because the
[1:26:02] preacher standing there
[1:26:04] that you're winning it's not because the
[1:26:07] song leader
[1:26:08] is leading that you're winning it's
[1:26:10] because the holy ghost
[1:26:12] is remaining
[1:26:20] hallelujah brother branham said in the
[1:26:22] greatest battle fault
[1:26:24] he said they cut their way through right
[1:26:27] into freedom
[1:26:29] he said those israelites were cutting
[1:26:30] their way all the way into freedom
[1:26:33] and he said when moses stood upon that
[1:26:35] mountain
[1:26:36] and he stood there and they lifted his
[1:26:39] hands up
[1:26:40] when his hands got weary and when his
[1:26:42] hands got tired
[1:26:44] it was only a type of what jesus would
[1:26:47] do at calvary
[1:26:49] he said and to make sure that jesus's
[1:26:52] hands didn't go
[1:26:53] down they nailed his hands to a cross
[1:26:56] so that you would be a sword the
[1:26:59] absolute victory
[1:27:01] his hands couldn't come down on calvary
[1:27:04] he didn't do a halfway job
[1:27:06] he finished it and when it got done he
[1:27:09] said
[1:27:09] it is finished
[1:27:11] [Applause]
[1:27:16] hallelujah
[1:27:19] hallelujah the bible says in psalms 16
[1:27:23] 4 thou hast given us a banner
[1:27:26] to them that fear thee that it may be
[1:27:28] displayed because of truth salah
[1:27:32] who thou has given
[1:27:36] a banner to them that fear thee isaiah
[1:27:39] 13 and 2
[1:27:40] lift up a banner upon the high mountain
[1:27:44] and exalt the voice unto them and shake
[1:27:46] the hand
[1:27:47] that they may go into the gates of the
[1:27:49] nobles
[1:27:50] now we can understand by by what we've
[1:27:53] just went through of the lifting up of
[1:27:54] the banner on the high mountain
[1:27:56] that this lifting up on the high of the
[1:27:58] banner
[1:27:59] it was a standard that was placed on a
[1:28:01] high mountain
[1:28:02] that was showing all the tribes that
[1:28:04] this is where we're going to meet at
[1:28:07] that this is where you are to assemble
[1:28:08] it out and it said to exalt
[1:28:11] the voice unto them it was to let loose
[1:28:14] a battle cry
[1:28:16] that this is what we're going to do
[1:28:20] but he said shake the hand that they may
[1:28:23] go
[1:28:23] into the gates of the nobles
[1:28:28] let me tell you i am no longer
[1:28:31] responsible
[1:28:32] for my actions
[1:28:35] shake the hand that they may go into the
[1:28:38] gates of the nobles
[1:28:40] you see there's a lot of times when
[1:28:41] somebody stand beside you
[1:28:43] and say we're going this way and we're
[1:28:45] going to fight all the way
[1:28:47] till we get that way and this is where
[1:28:49] we are to meet at
[1:28:50] and this is where we are to do battle at
[1:28:52] but when you can't hear your neighbor's
[1:28:54] voice when you can't hear them because
[1:28:57] of
[1:28:57] all the chaos that's going around when
[1:28:59] you hear
[1:29:00] the clinging of shields and spears and
[1:29:03] swords
[1:29:04] and you can't see where to go at
[1:29:08] the prophet said shake the hand
[1:29:11] shake the hand this is where we're going
[1:29:14] to we're walking all the way over here
[1:29:16] and we're going to bring destruction to
[1:29:18] babylon
[1:29:20] now i know some of you you're a little
[1:29:22] bit quiet and you don't like
[1:29:23] lifting your voice and you don't like
[1:29:25] shouting a man but next time just so i
[1:29:27] know just shake the hand at me
[1:29:30] just shake your hand at me because i'm

[1:31:37] [Applause]
[1:31:42] hallelujah
[1:31:44] hallelujah
[1:31:47] hallelujah what was it it was the
[1:31:51] lifting up of the banner
[1:31:53] the lifting up of the inside that showed
[1:31:56] us
[1:31:57] where we're going to victory at
[1:32:03] every child could probably sing this
[1:32:05] scripture
[1:32:06] he brought me into
[1:32:10] his banqueting house and his banner
[1:32:14] over me his love
[1:32:23] when solomon begins to express this
[1:32:27] he said he begins to write his letter
[1:32:31] of love
[1:32:36] and the queen says he brought me
[1:32:40] unto his house of wine
[1:32:45] he brought me to the house of
[1:32:47] stimulation
[1:32:49] he brought me to the joys of revelation
[1:32:54] and it stimulates me because he brought
[1:32:58] me
[1:32:58] to the house of wine
[1:33:02] hallelujah and what was it it was his
[1:33:05] banner over me
[1:33:12] hallelujah it was
[1:33:15] l o v
[1:33:20] he
[1:33:26] hallelujah he brought me
[1:33:31] he paid for me he redeemed me
[1:33:36] i was rightfully his in the first place
[1:33:40] i never belonged to satan
[1:33:44] hallelujah sometimes children you may
[1:33:47] feel like you're the worst of christians
[1:33:51] and you may feel like the devil's got
[1:33:53] you but if god has put a shield or
[1:33:56] predestination
[1:33:57] upon your life you never was the devils
[1:34:00] you never will be the devils hallelujah
[1:34:03] and he will never be yours
[1:34:06] but you were his
[1:34:09] he's covered you with his life
[1:34:11] [Applause]
[1:34:14] you see his standard is his word and
[1:34:18] when the enemy comes in like a flood
[1:34:21] the spirit of the lord lifts
[1:34:25] up the standard
[1:34:29] you remember me telling you about when i
[1:34:30] went out there to wyoming and i was
[1:34:32] floating down that snake river
[1:34:34] we're going down that thing and that
[1:34:36] river is such a massive
[1:34:38] massive river it's got millions of
[1:34:39] gallons of water that it's dumped
[1:34:41] through that river
[1:34:42] every so often and it's such powerful
[1:34:45] because all the snow
[1:34:46] that's coming down off those mountains
[1:34:47] and our guide that we was with we was
[1:34:49] down there
[1:34:50] he was telling us the power of that
[1:34:52] river how that it floods out every year
[1:34:55] and it erodes
[1:34:56] all the banks around it that there were
[1:34:59] houses and farmhouses that were built
[1:35:01] there
[1:35:01] when the early settlers came and because
[1:35:04] of the erosion
[1:35:05] that came and came from that river it
[1:35:08] robbed them of those shelters and all of
[1:35:11] a sudden
[1:35:12] when that river it just kept eroding and
[1:35:14] eroding and eroding
[1:35:15] and those houses just fell in
[1:35:19] you see that's what a powerful river
[1:35:21] will do
[1:35:22] and when the enemy comes in like a flood
[1:35:25] he tries to erode away your faith
[1:35:27] and i wrote away this message and aurora
[1:35:30] wrote away your family history in this
[1:35:32] message
[1:35:33] and arrow and wrote away what the pastor
[1:35:36] says and
[1:35:36] he rode away the singing and he wrote
[1:35:39] away the praise
[1:35:40] he wrote away the worship that's what
[1:35:42] the enemy wants to do
[1:35:44] but when the enemy comes in like a flood
[1:35:47] god
[1:35:47] raises the standard of his word and he
[1:35:50] looks at satan
[1:35:52] and said that's enough
[1:35:55] what does god do when he comes he stops
[1:35:58] the erosion
[1:35:59] and he starts building back
[1:36:05] some of you walked up in here if we
[1:36:06] could talk about your spiritual life
[1:36:08] you walked up in church and you was like
[1:36:10] a halfway
[1:36:11] person if we could look at your
[1:36:15] spiritual life
[1:36:16] we designed you as a man you were
[1:36:18] halfway
[1:36:19] your legs were halfway eaten off your
[1:36:21] heart was halfway eating off
[1:36:23] your mind was halfway eaten off because
[1:36:26] the enemy
[1:36:27] was eroding everything that you were
[1:36:29] meant to
[1:36:30] be but when jesus came he built you
[1:36:34] up to be in a perfect stature of the
[1:36:36] perfect man
[1:36:37] and you would be capped with the love of
[1:36:40] god
[1:36:44] you see his standard
[1:36:47] is his word and when god
[1:36:51] goes to pointing to something or
[1:36:52] pointing you or something
[1:36:54] he's not going to point you to some sign
[1:36:56] or some emotion
[1:36:57] he's going to point you to his word
[1:37:01] now there'll be signs that follow his
[1:37:02] word there'll be wonders that follow his
[1:37:05] word because jesus said that these signs
[1:37:08] shall follow them that believe that in
[1:37:11] my name
[1:37:13] in my name they shall cast out devils in
[1:37:15] my name that shall speak with new
[1:37:17] tongues
[1:37:17] in my name they shall drink drink any
[1:37:20] deadly thing and it shall not hurt
[1:37:21] them and shall take up any deadly thing
[1:37:23] and it shall not hurt them
[1:37:25] and in my name they shall lay hands on
[1:37:27] the sick and they shall
[1:37:29] recover these signs shall follow
[1:37:32] them that belief you see the signs will
[1:37:35] point you to the belief
[1:37:38] don't you get about excited about signs
[1:37:40] and wonders they're just following you
[1:37:44] we're not following them they're
[1:37:45] following us but i want to point
[1:37:48] the world out there that's listening
[1:37:50] that's hearing these tapes
[1:37:51] hearing these messages if you follow
[1:37:54] them signs
[1:37:55] it'll point you to our belief
[1:38:00] are you with me you see you go down the
[1:38:02] road and
[1:38:03] you see a sign it says you getting ready
[1:38:06] to come into grotto's and you look on
[1:38:08] the backside of that sign and says you
[1:38:09] just left grottos
[1:38:11] that's how big our town is but that sign
[1:38:15] is pointing you to something
[1:38:17] and moses was the signpost for
[1:38:21] israel's deliverance and the prophet
[1:38:23] said and i
[1:38:24] as i was with moses 1960 he said now
[1:38:26] what if moses when he went down there
[1:38:28] and he had a sign with a stick
[1:38:30] and within with his hand the sign here
[1:38:32] is no more the commission
[1:38:34] than it was with moses well if all the
[1:38:37] israelites say
[1:38:38] say oh all you egyptians all the rest of
[1:38:40] you israelites come over here
[1:38:42] we got a man to do a trick with his
[1:38:44] hands you ought to see it we got a man
[1:38:46] that can take a stick and make a snake
[1:38:48] out of it come see it
[1:38:50] that was just a signpost
[1:38:55] that wasn't the commission they wasn't
[1:38:58] waiting
[1:38:59] for a signpost they was waiting
[1:39:03] on deliverance but the son
[1:39:07] proved the commission you see he had the
[1:39:10] gift in his hand
[1:39:11] he had the voice of the sign and it
[1:39:13] proved exactly what it was
[1:39:15] the sign proved that moses had
[1:39:18] been commissioned by the great i am
[1:39:24] i could preach 10 000 years to you right
[1:39:26] there
[1:39:27] that the signs that are following in
[1:39:29] your life
[1:39:31] proves your commission it proves
[1:39:34] your representation the signs that are
[1:39:37] following you
[1:39:39] we say well i ain't got no signs i ain't
[1:39:41] got no wonders
[1:39:43] what are you believing in
[1:39:46] i'm not talking about oil in a hand but
[1:39:48] i'm talking about producing
[1:39:50] what this message said that it would
[1:39:53] produce
[1:39:54] no i'm not talking about you walking out
[1:39:56] to somebody that's got a cancer on their
[1:39:58] nose
[1:39:59] and speaking of that cancer and that
[1:40:00] cancer fall off i'm talking to you about
[1:40:02] a life
[1:40:03] that'll live all the way throughout the
[1:40:06] week when the preacher's there when the
[1:40:08] deacon ain't there
[1:40:09] when the preacher is there and the
[1:40:10] preacher ain't there it'll still live
[1:40:12] those signs are following them that
[1:40:15] belief
[1:40:17] but i still believe that there's enough
[1:40:20] holy ghost on the inside of sister
[1:40:22] stephanie
[1:40:22] that if somebody walks up to her at her
[1:40:24] work and says hey i need prayer
[1:40:26] i got a headache so bad that it'll beat
[1:40:28] you every way back
[1:40:30] it'll hit you so hard that your mama
[1:40:32] feel it
[1:40:33] i believe she's got enough holy ghost on
[1:40:35] the inside of her
[1:40:36] that she can lay her hands on the stick
[1:40:39] and the sick
[1:40:40] be made whole
[1:40:45] it's not lifting up sister stephanie or
[1:40:48] the believer
[1:40:49] it's lifting up the standard
[1:40:53] you see when you go to lifting up him
[1:40:56] you watch him come
[1:41:01] you watch when the enemy comes he'll
[1:41:03] begin to lift himself up
[1:41:05] and all of a sudden you get pushed down
[1:41:10] oh but there's a god
[1:41:15] that even though the enemy may try to
[1:41:17] stop you and they try to hinder you
[1:41:19] there's a god that'll push back
[1:41:23] he'll push back against doubt he'll push
[1:41:26] back against unbelief
[1:41:28] he'll push back against sin he won't
[1:41:30] leave you down there in the dirt but
[1:41:32] he'll raise you up
[1:41:34] are you with me we buried sister sue
[1:41:37] comer this past week
[1:41:39] but he made sister sue calmer a promise
[1:41:42] that i'm going to a place and i'm
[1:41:44] preparing a mansion
[1:41:46] for you that where i am you may be
[1:41:49] also when he looked at mary and martha
[1:41:52] when they were wondering about it he
[1:41:54] said i
[1:41:55] am the resurrection and the life
[1:41:59] he's not in the replacement business
[1:42:01] he's in the resurrection business
[1:42:04] and satan has tried to push you down
[1:42:07] into the grave
[1:42:08] but god is here to raise you up
[1:42:14] kovitz doing its best to stop the
[1:42:17] children of god
[1:42:19] you heard by the prayer request tonight
[1:42:21] that it's it's in our it's in our ranks
[1:42:24] it's in the message people people that
[1:42:26] you know
[1:42:27] you are not you are not exempt from
[1:42:31] sickness
[1:42:33] but there's enough god still here in
[1:42:36] laodicea
[1:42:37] that's greater than covet that's greater
[1:42:39] than a headache
[1:42:40] greater than a fever greater than chills
[1:42:46] he said greater is he that is in you
[1:42:49] than he that is in the world
[1:42:54] some people say well i'm too afraid to
[1:42:55] lay hands on a sick i'm afraid
[1:42:58] that i'm taking brother branham's place
[1:43:02] where in the world did you get that dumb
[1:43:06] theology at
[1:43:07] the bible did not say in william
[1:43:10] branham's name
[1:43:11] they shall cast out devils it did not
[1:43:14] say
[1:43:15] in the name of homer frazier ron spencer
[1:43:18] donnie reagan
[1:43:19] they shall cast out devils but in my
[1:43:22] name
[1:43:24] they shall lay heads on the sick and
[1:43:26] they shall recover
[1:43:28] that's for all the believers that
[1:43:30] believe
[1:43:33] [Applause]
[1:43:36] hallelujah
[1:43:41] let me behave nah don't let me behave
[1:43:45] if you've got that calm that kind of
[1:43:47] dumb theology
[1:43:49] that'll make you think that we need a
[1:43:51] prophet here
[1:43:52] just so we can have a vision the bible
[1:43:55] said that
[1:43:55] in the last days i will pour out my
[1:43:58] spirit
[1:43:58] upon all flesh your young men shall
[1:44:02] dream dreams the old men should dream
[1:44:04] dreams your young men shall see visions
[1:44:06] it shows to me brother bronzer still is
[1:44:08] still a young man
[1:44:12] but we're not trying to take william
[1:44:14] branham's part
[1:44:16] we're trying to take our position in the
[1:44:19] promises of god
[1:44:21] we're not lifting up a man we're lifting
[1:44:25] up
[1:44:26] jesus
[1:44:29] any time you go to lifting up a man you
[1:44:32] watch the fall
[1:44:33] of that kingdom but you watch every time
[1:44:37] you go to lifting up the name of jesus
[1:44:40] what does it do it begins to build and
[1:44:43] it begins to add to the kingdom of god
[1:44:51] i watch a young boy brother heaven may
[1:44:53] has come to me
[1:44:55] and he laid his heart out on the line
[1:44:57] and he began to rehearse some things to
[1:44:59] me
[1:45:00] that there were some things in his life
[1:45:02] that he wanted fixed
[1:45:03] who did i think he was trying to do you
[1:45:05] think he you think i thought that he was
[1:45:07] trying to impress me
[1:45:09] absolutely not what was he trying to do
[1:45:13] it was the spirit of christ on the
[1:45:15] inside of him
[1:45:16] lifting up the standard
[1:45:23] sure you got people out there who watch
[1:45:25] you watch you because you pray louder
[1:45:28] watch you because you sing louder that's
[1:45:30] just your makeup
[1:45:32] they're not trying to impress you or
[1:45:34] anybody
[1:45:35] else that's really got a real spirit of
[1:45:37] christ on them they're
[1:45:38] just trying to lift the name of jesus
[1:45:45] i'm probably one of the loudest people
[1:45:47] here one of the loudest singers probably
[1:45:50] but do you think for one minute that i'm
[1:45:53] trying to out sing brother william
[1:45:57] absolutely not there is nothing on the
[1:46:00] inside
[1:46:01] of a real christian that's trying to
[1:46:03] lift their own gift
[1:46:06] real christian trying to lift their own
[1:46:08] voice
[1:46:09] lift their own praise they are doing it
[1:46:12] for the adoration of the kingdom
[1:46:14] of god
[1:46:18] now you go and look in numbers chapter
[1:46:20] 21 i don't want you to go and look at it
[1:46:22] right now but
[1:46:22] but you go and read over it later
[1:46:26] but i want you to go and look down
[1:46:27] through there numbers chapter 21
[1:46:29] and i find it so amazing that here we
[1:46:33] see when the serpents
[1:46:34] lifted up on a pole but you watch when
[1:46:37] the children of israel
[1:46:38] they they begin to murmur against god
[1:46:41] and say things against god
[1:46:44] directly after they vowed a vow to god
[1:46:47] saying
[1:46:48] that if you will indeed destroy the king
[1:46:51] ararat and the canaanites
[1:46:53] that we will go forth in your name
[1:46:57] and as soon as they go out
[1:47:00] and they destroy the canaanites and king
[1:47:03] arahat
[1:47:03] they begin to murmur against god
[1:47:07] and i think are we built out of the same
[1:47:10] stuff
[1:47:12] that they are that as soon as god gives
[1:47:15] us a victory we begin to murmur
[1:47:17] and complain and they begin to say
[1:47:20] things against god
[1:47:21] and god sent down fiery serpents
[1:47:25] and they begin to bite the people
[1:47:29] it was a fiery bite and as soon
[1:47:32] as the bite hit the person they begin to
[1:47:35] have a fever
[1:47:36] that's why they call it a fiery serpent
[1:47:39] that the fire of the venom
[1:47:41] would roll through their body and cause
[1:47:43] sickness to run through them
[1:47:45] and a great host of israel died because
[1:47:49] of the snakebite all of this was done
[1:47:53] because of their sin and when they
[1:47:56] realized
[1:47:57] what they had done they went to moses
[1:48:00] and said we have sinned against god
[1:48:05] and moses began to pray
[1:48:09] to god and verse 8
[1:48:13] numbers 21 the bible said and the lord
[1:48:16] said unto moses
[1:48:17] make thee a fiery serpent and set it
[1:48:20] upon a pole
[1:48:22] if you look at that word paul in hebrew
[1:48:25] it means something that's lifted up
[1:48:27] a standard a signal poem inside a banner
[1:48:31] a rallying point
[1:48:33] an ensign that is to be
[1:48:38] displayed
[1:48:41] set at a point of paul when it's come to
[1:48:43] pass that everyone that has bitten
[1:48:45] when he looketh upon it shall live and
[1:48:47] moses
[1:48:48] made a serpent of brass and put it upon
[1:48:50] a pole and it came to pass
[1:48:53] that if a serpent had bitten any man
[1:48:55] when he beheld the serpent of brass
[1:48:58] he lived now notice
[1:49:01] the prophet said again god told moses
[1:49:04] and the type of symbol said go and make
[1:49:06] a serpent
[1:49:07] out of brass and put it on a pole now
[1:49:09] the serpent and the symbol meant sin the
[1:49:11] serpent represented the serpent
[1:49:13] from the garden of eden already judged
[1:49:16] that snake turned from an animal
[1:49:20] he wasn't a reptile the bible said that
[1:49:22] he was the most subtle of all the beasts
[1:49:24] of the field
[1:49:25] he wasn't a reptile he was a beast
[1:49:30] and he turned to a serpent on his belly
[1:49:33] and that snake represented sin
[1:49:38] judged you see when the serpent began to
[1:49:41] slip
[1:49:42] in into the garden of eden what did he
[1:49:45] do
[1:49:46] he began to elevate himself
[1:49:49] he began to lift up his theories and
[1:49:51] lift up his own ideas
[1:49:53] and he brought reasoning to eve and
[1:49:55] because
[1:49:56] she doubted one word of god is the
[1:49:59] reason the fall
[1:50:01] came but god
[1:50:05] made an eternal atonement
[1:50:09] again now the bright serpent couldn't
[1:50:10] pray for anybody
[1:50:14] he couldn't lay hands on no one he had
[1:50:16] no hands to lay on
[1:50:18] but god provided a way for them to look
[1:50:20] and live
[1:50:21] it was a symbol it was an ensign in the
[1:50:23] camp of israel
[1:50:24] that the god of heaven lived in the camp
[1:50:28] with israel when they seen a man here
[1:50:32] that
[1:50:32] with a snake bite nothing would to make
[1:50:34] him well and when he looked at the
[1:50:36] inside with all of his heart and
[1:50:37] believed the man
[1:50:39] you see him the next day he was well
[1:50:42] it was a sign to every israelite
[1:50:45] that they could look and live
[1:50:50] when they would walk to the camp and
[1:50:51] walk by their friends
[1:50:53] that they knew that they'd been bit and
[1:50:56] they walked by on the next day
[1:50:58] and they're completely made whole it was
[1:51:00] a sign to every one of them
[1:51:02] that there was an atonement that was
[1:51:05] made for them
[1:51:07] that they could look on that brass
[1:51:08] serpent and they could look
[1:51:10] and live it was a lifting
[1:51:14] of an atonement
[1:51:18] that was an attribute of their sin
[1:51:23] because of the snake bite
[1:51:27] god lifted a snake on a pole
[1:51:32] i know it blows your mind
[1:51:36] but you look at the contrast of god
[1:51:39] and you see the serpent from the
[1:51:41] beginning
[1:51:42] and you see has god judged
[1:51:45] that it represented that sin was judged
[1:51:49] and when you look at jesus hanging on a
[1:51:52] cross
[1:51:53] it was the lifting up as an ensign
[1:51:56] that there was an atonement that was
[1:51:58] made for your sickness
[1:52:00] and made for your healing and when they
[1:52:03] looked at that ensign
[1:52:05] and they seen that serpent on a pole it
[1:52:07] was proving to them
[1:52:09] that they had been forgiven of their sin
[1:52:11] and that they could be made whole
[1:52:14] of their snake bite oh
[1:52:17] hallelujah man is born a woman full of
[1:52:19] trouble
[1:52:21] and he's got trouble in his days he's
[1:52:23] born in sin shaped into iniquity
[1:52:25] but there is an atonement for all
[1:52:28] of the sin that's been stacked up
[1:52:30] against you
[1:52:32] but this ain't just a one-sided
[1:52:34] atonement
[1:52:36] he's not just your savior
[1:52:39] i needed him as a savior every single
[1:52:42] one of you whether you want to agree
[1:52:43] with me or not you needed him as a
[1:52:45] savior
[1:52:46] some of you were dirty some of you are
[1:52:48] rotten some are you with scroungers
[1:52:51] but thank god hallelujah you've been
[1:52:54] saved
[1:52:55] by the grace of god that's one side of
[1:52:59] the atonement
[1:53:00] but there's another side of the
[1:53:01] atonement
[1:53:04] hallelujah and you have a claim on that
[1:53:07] atonement that he was bruised
[1:53:09] for your iniquities he was chastised for
[1:53:12] your peace
[1:53:14] hallelujah and by his stripes
[1:53:17] you are healed
[1:53:21] it's a two-sided atonement
[1:53:29] what was it proven he was proving that
[1:53:32] there was a standard that was lifted up
[1:53:35] are you with me that they can look at
[1:53:37] that standard
[1:53:38] and it took care of the situation
[1:53:41] you see it was a sign to all the
[1:53:43] israelites that we can be set free from
[1:53:46] this
[1:53:49] there were still serpents out there that
[1:53:52] even though they got bit
[1:53:56] are you with me the sign was lifted
[1:54:00] but it didn't take away the snake bite
[1:54:02] the snake would still bite them
[1:54:05] but it was showing them that if you get
[1:54:08] bit
[1:54:11] let me preach to you just a minute
[1:54:14] and some of you lived real good for a
[1:54:16] while but then you fell back into sin
[1:54:19] maybe like some person
[1:54:20] somebody said one time well i've been
[1:54:21] serving the lord real hard here lately
[1:54:25] that person went out and got drunk i've
[1:54:28] been serving real hard here lately so
[1:54:30] i'm just go out and serve myself for a
[1:54:32] little bit
[1:54:35] i want you to know little children that
[1:54:37] if you're falling
[1:54:39] you've got an advocate with the father
[1:54:42] that old serpent's still out there
[1:54:44] trying to make you fall
[1:54:45] he's trying to make you sin he's trying
[1:54:47] to make you lust
[1:54:48] but if you fall there is still an
[1:54:52] atonement for you
[1:54:57] and it's showing that there is an
[1:54:59] insight
[1:55:00] to every cancer patient to every covet
[1:55:03] patient to every ad hit
[1:55:05] to every covet every drug hit every
[1:55:08] alcoholic
[1:55:09] that there is an enzyme that is lifted
[1:55:11] up
[1:55:13] now you don't have to stay there no
[1:55:14] longer but you can go
[1:55:16] free
[1:55:18] [Applause]
[1:55:23] and when jesus was speaking to moses
[1:55:26] speaking of moses when he was speaking
[1:55:28] in academias he said that
[1:55:30] as moses lifted up the serpent in the
[1:55:32] wilderness
[1:55:33] even so must the son of man
[1:55:37] be lifted up
[1:55:41] let me leave you with this let the
[1:55:44] musicians come
[1:55:47] that if the type would let the people
[1:55:50] get well
[1:55:52] how much more would the anti-type do it
[1:55:59] the brass serpent and a shadow would do
[1:56:01] it
[1:56:03] what ought the reality
[1:56:10] hallelujah part two
[1:56:15] coming up stand with me this evening
[1:56:22] see god don't expect you to mold
[1:56:24] yourself

[1:56:39] the devil

[1:56:46] the image of what he's expected

[1:56:54] before the foundation of the world

[1:57:01] coming
[1:57:03] of sarah klein

[1:57:38] the wall says sarah

[1:57:42] dress right today
[1:57:44] what does she do she just lifts up the
[1:57:47] standard
[1:57:49] and god lets the standard flow over
[1:57:52] sister sarah
[1:57:54] and the standard makes you dress right

[1:57:59] the standard makes you talk right it's

[2:04:26] this evening i had a story that was
[2:04:29] shared with me this past
[2:04:30] week about a
[2:04:34] an injured man in world war ii that had
[2:04:38] been
[2:04:39] been injured in the fight he'd been
[2:04:42] fighting for his country
[2:04:44] got hurt and battling
[2:04:48] he sat there and he knew he knew that
[2:04:50] the court man was coming the medic was
[2:04:52] coming to him
[2:04:55] he just knew that they came they'd
[2:04:57] always run them they'd run them ditch
[2:04:58] lines they'd run down through there
[2:05:00] so he just sat there and he rested short
[2:05:02] even though i'm shot and even though i'm
[2:05:04] injured
[2:05:05] i know that he's coming i know that
[2:05:06] medic is coming
[2:05:08] so he came and there was all other all
[2:05:10] kinds of men that were sitting around
[2:05:12] him that have been wounded in battle
[2:05:14] so here comes the medic and he comes and
[2:05:16] he patches him up the best he can
[2:05:19] but he was still hurting he was still in
[2:05:20] pain he was still afflicted
[2:05:23] and the medic said now i gotta leave i
[2:05:25] gotta go and take care of everybody else
[2:05:26] i gotta go fix everybody else but i'll
[2:05:28] be back
[2:05:29] you see you see he knew
[2:05:33] that that medic would return because
[2:05:35] their standard was
[2:05:37] that we always come back
[2:05:40] we always come back though he was there
[2:05:43] maybe bleeding out or whatever the case
[2:05:45] might have been
[2:05:47] knew that that medic would come back but
[2:05:50] you see that enemy
[2:05:52] the enemy on the other side was watching
[2:05:54] for that red flag
[2:05:56] that was posted that medic banner
[2:05:59] that was posted on that man that medic
[2:06:03] they would try to shoot down that man
[2:06:06] and here he was sitting in that trench
[2:06:10] waiting for the medic because he knew he
[2:06:12] would return
[2:06:14] and sure enough the medic came back
[2:06:17] because that was their standard that
[2:06:20] they would always come back
[2:06:23] and when the medic came back and they
[2:06:24] began to lift this soldier
[2:06:26] and they began to lift him up out of
[2:06:27] that ditch that medic was shot
[2:06:30] at that spot but he came back
[2:06:34] and because of this medic this soldier
[2:06:37] was able to live
[2:06:39] you see the medic christ jesus
[2:06:43] always comes back you may be wounded in
[2:06:46] battle
[2:06:47] you may be hurt you may you may be
[2:06:50] off on your timing of why god is doing
[2:06:52] this or why god's doing that why
[2:06:54] why hasn't he showed up yet but you
[2:06:57] remember
[2:06:58] he always comes back
[2:07:02] you may feel like he's left you for a
[2:07:03] season but he always comes back
[2:07:08] oh hallelujah that dove
[2:07:14] has spread forth that great speckled
