so happy that we can all be a part of that amen amen so good to see you each and every one of you we love you with all of our hearts and amen I wore pink today in honor of our mothers and so amen God bless you I'd like to speak to you today on Grace amen am I I I will never be able to touch the edge of the iceberg of it but I am so thankful I just so thankful so thankful amen we would be so happy if you had a $100,000 credit card bill and you knew there was no way ever in your life time to pay for it and someone came along and paid it all off you talking about happy you're talking about a relief off of your shoulders you would be so happy but in our great Christian walk that's kind of what happens but we don't want to go back and put a more debt on that credit card no more that's right we don't make Grace a disc Grace amen God bless you today I've read this to you a few times and I want to read it again today because it means a lot to this service I've given God a million reasons not to love me and none of them changed his mind Hallelujah Grace is the unmar favor of God you don't pay for it it's it's not necessarily a gift you don't beg for it it's something that God gives you it's a free gift it's undeserved of his love and favor of God towards a man as a sinner it is especially exhibited in God's great redemption's plan through Jesus Christ and it is the only by the free grace of God that we can embrace the offer of mercy and the appropriate to ourselves that the blessings of graciously purchased by his redeeming blood the grace of God it's so spontaneous it's so unmerited and it's something that only a sinner can really understand angels will never be able to understand the grace of God if you would turn with me to Hebrews Chap 11:5 and then Proverbs chapter 3 amen by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him I read that to you because you're the same people that are preparing for Rapture and you will not be found that's right you've been testifying that it's coming and people have just been going ignoring the the signs and and all of a sudden boom that's right we're not going to leave any love letters or left behind letters or anything like that we're going to leave amen are you with me now in Proverbs 3 and verse 3 let not mercy and Truth forsake thee bind them about thy neck write them up the tablet the table of thine heart and so shal thou find favor and good understanding in the sight of God in man trust in the Lord and with all thine heart and lean not to thy under standing you may be seated today Romans chapter 3 and verse 23 and I want us all to read this together today so good to see you Romans 3 and verse 23 is everybody ready is it up on there all right we go for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God so that leaves nobody out amen that leaves absolutely nobody out prophets priests Kings there's only one that came to the Earth that had no sin only one so every one of us today every one of us whether you was raised in a Christian home or a drunkard's home every one of us needed the blood of Jesus Christ let's read it again for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God now every one of us are in a battle every one of us as we get closer to the Rapture we're all in a battle there's no pity me here every one of us are in a battle I I got this this week and on June the 22nd of 1982 1982 Joe Biden was a senator from Delaware and confronted then prime minister monum bean and he had a long history with Israel all the way back to the beginning and during the Senate Foreign Relations Committee testimony threatening to cut off Aid to Israel I mean knows what happened this week monan Megan replied don't threaten us with cutting off your Aid it will not work I am not a Jew with trembling knees I'm a proud Jew with 3700 years of civilized history nobody came to our Aid when we were dying in gas Chambers and in ovens nobody came to our Aid when we were striving to create our country we paid for it we fought for it we died for it we will stand for our principles we will defend them and when necessary we will die for them again with or without your Aid that should be a history lesson for all of us today so I want to add to that today and I'm not into your politics so don't you throw your darts at me right I am not a bride with trembling [Applause] knees if Israel as our counterpart I am not a bride with trembling knees and rubbing hands together with worry I stand with my banner held high and my sword is pulled and there is devil's blood all over my sword we are warriors and we will not run and we will not hide we shall overcome Victory shall be mine Hallelujah don't you love the Lord that's a good way to start isn't it now brother brandom says in the kinsman redeemer he said now Sons and Daughters who ha who has the most powerful who has the most power before God an angel an angel as his servant now they're his servants what are you his sons and daughters who has the more power in heaven a sinner that's been saved by grace or an archangel that's standing there by his right side he said the sinner The Sinner that's been saved by grace has more Authority in heaven than the Archangel that stood by his side without sin because he's a son and a son has more Authority than a servant of course I like that don't you brother Doug good to see you in the house of the Lord back there give the Lord a good hand for brother Doug for those that don't know brother Doug had a he fell broke his hip they did a a replacement there and he's been in rehab now he's in theab amen so good to have him here in the house of the Lord in Zechariah 4 and verse 6 then answered and then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord and desable saying it's not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of hosts who out thou oh oh great Heaven before zerubabel Thou shalt become a plain and he shall bring forth The Headstone thereof with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it I just want to read some of the definition of the scripture that you have just been read who are art thou oh great mountains before zerubabel Thou shalt become a plain and how difficulty it's represented it it's such a great Mountain this mountain is impossible it's immovable it's a heap of rubbish like a great Mountain which is that must be got a away or a work that cannot go on the enemies of the Jews are proud and and hard work cannot go on he said the the the enemies of the Jews are proud and hard as they as great mountains but when God has a work to do I love this the mountains that stand in the way will dwindle into mole Hills the mountains that stand in your way will dwindle like mole Hills I love that don't you that huge mountain will become a plane not by what you did not by your might but we scream Grace Grace second cor Corinthians 12 and verse 9 and he said said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my grace my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ May rest upon me therefore I take pleasure in infirmities and in reproaches and in necessities and persecutions in distresses or for Christ's sake for when I am weak then I am strong if we can just say it tonight our king is not on a cross no more that part has already been paid for he is not in a tomb no more let me just say and hell has been conquered every demon has been conquered and our King stands as our Mighty Champion are you with me now we declare Worthy is our lamb Jesus would pray thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread as we forgive our debts and as we forgive our debtors I love these words and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom the power and the glory forever amen every one of us stand here today with flaws in our lives you know as you first meet somebody you think well this man is perfect or this woman is perfect and the longer you're around them or the longer you're married to them or the longer that you work with them you find out that they got a flaw but I want you to know the flaw will either destroy you or it will drive you I choose for it not to destroy me are you with me now brother B said the grace is what God did for me and works is what I do for God Amen they'll make a Doctrine out of it they will think that works is what wins your merits if it is it is in a free grift Grace is what God did for you and by grace are you saved and our works is what you do in appreciation for the grace that he showed for you if you love him and you like to do the works of love you do that because you love him now remember when Jesus was standing there with a woman that was committed caught in adultery the law would would make her a prisoner and the prison house would not set her free and according to the law this woman had to die and they brought her to Jesus what an interesting thing they brought her to Jesus and they had a law to put her to death but now they're going to tempt him what is Jesus going to do with this adulterous woman and Jesus simply said as he was writing on the ground he that is without sin for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God brother Ron I have you to know that I have not sin in my life the thoughts that you thought this morning the attitudes that you exhibited this week come on somebody just go ahead and preach with me here for a little while and maybe they didn't make it from here thank God that they didn't go out of here but you know that you know that you know you and without God and His Saving Grace you're in a mess of trouble and so these men knew that he could read their hearts and read their lives and call their sin out but then they would be a public shame he that is without sin cast the first [Music] stone you talking about a rock dropping party a rock dropping party wouldn't you like to go to a rock dropping party men that had came to church today ready to destroy this woman now the word has quickened and now it's come to their part and he that is without sin go ahead and throw your stone you hear people blast this one and blast that one they need this part they need to re Jesus to come into their lives none of us has got a right whether you can throw a stone at 90 mph or 100 miles an hour or at 15 miles an hour right I don't know how far it is from where you stand but come on and they turned and walked away and Jesus looks up at her brother Doug what an incredible statement Jesus looks up at her and he says woman where's thine accusers Lord I have none I love these next words neither do I accuse [Applause] you go and sin no more Hallelujah aren't you aren't you appreciative of that today what it is when a Parton comes your way and you accept the pardon and you realize I'm not guilty of that no more but you did it this house did it you look like the same house but there's a new King on the inside of your heart because Jesus said I am the way the truth and the life many of us have made choices that we we have regretted over and over and over again choices take us somewhere choices take us somewhere make sure as you're making choices in your life let me just say this to you many of us have SED Bad Seed remember we're all in the same team now many of us have SED Bad Seed seed come up you can't cancel the Harvest seed come up but what you must do is plant more good seed than ever was SED bad seed and the good seed will cancel out the it'll choke it out hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah remember you reap what you sow remember this your sins will find you out Abraham was justified by faith we could just talk about this for just a little while we're in we're in we're all of us in the same family Abraham was justified by faith that's quite a statement Abraham was a man that was known as a liar to save his own skin he lied without God's grace he's in trouble and he's the father of us all Moses could have been known as the great murderer cuz he murdered an Egyptian and left him and even after 40 years he comes back and the people remember him did you come back to kill us too Paul that writes 14 books of the Bible was a murderer he was guilty of murdering we don't know exactly how many but he was guilty in his Zeal right in his Zeal to get rid of this Jesus movement he was guilty of Taking Lives one being Steven that would hon him the rest of the days of his life because he held his coat as Steven the Deacon stood there and preached all the way back from the beginning to this same Jesus and then at his death he said I saw him standing at the right hand of God so we could say Paul is not worthy today he was a murderer are you with me now because Paul would write it like this 1 Corinthians 15 for I am the least of the Apostles that am not me to be called an apostle because I persecuted the church but by the grace of God but by the grace of God I am what I am all of us had a lot of chapters in our life that we are so ashamed of but by the grace of God but by the amazing grace of God oh we ought to shout but by the amazing grace of God he rewrote my life and I am what I [Applause] am brother brandom had it not been for the grace of God would have killed five boys is making fun of him and he'd had enough he had a family heritage of some mean mean Brams brother Ron but brother brandham wasn't mean it are you serious with me come on he had a gun and he was a shot and would get upset if the second bullet didn't go through the same hole that's right he would get upset if he shot a squirrel and didn't shoot it in the eye right when he's shooting at these boys and the gun would not go off and they're running for their life had it not been for the grace of God William Brandon would have spent his whole life in prison but God rich in Mercy stop that boy from killing those five men he stopped him because he had a lot of chapters in the book he stopped him he would have never exhibited the prophet of God Malachi 4:5 and6 never saw the mighty Angel never preach the seals never preach the church agents never delivered the message because Satan had him in a trap and Satan was trying to destroy his life because Satan watched that Whirlwind come down over that that but that was William brandom how much has God stopped things in your life he stopped it he stopped it because your book would have been a lot of different than it is today but God rich in mercy God rich in Mercy stop the choice stop the decision stop the relationship stop stop it because God had a plan God had a [Applause] plan how many people had incredible potential amen and because of a stupid decision spent the rest of their life in prison phenomenal phenomenal families and one bad night with a wrong kind of friends good people up till one night and we asked the question what could have been been what could have been what could have happened in their life what could what could they have done but one bad decision and you think well well I'm just sitting here on my choice really really really you haven't got out a message kindergarten yet your choices were taking you the wrong way and God started closing the doors on your life cuz he had a [Music] [Applause] brother Roger you were writing the book the wrong way and definitely an was but God had a plan it was phenomenal people in dros could not understand it that you and Homer Fraser link up and be best buddies thank you Lord God had a plan he had a plan in your life who's greater I'm thankful to a god that's Eternal and rich in Mercy when he stops your plans literally stopped your plans I thank God that Mercy is not over I thank God that we've got a God that's so rich in Mercy brother BR said that's what the way it is today we guilty unworthy should die these incredible statements he said we're not even worthy of living we're not worthy to come to Christ we're not worthy to ask anything but God I'm trying to behave but God never looks at your unworthiness God never looks at your unworthiness so I want to say this to you then you quit looking at it then you quit looking at others [Applause] un brother Ron but you don't have a right to point let me just take care of this here you don't have a right to point brother on if you you don't have a [Music] right or you you'll open up Pandora's Box neither that things that are under the blood of Jesus Christ you don't have a right to go dig it out let me help your marriages here right now if it's under the blood of Jesus Christ don't you bring it up I'll help you now do not ever talk about old boyfriends and old girlfriends and how they were good to you or how they're bad to you don't bring it up don't if it's under the blood of Jesus Christ don't you now become guilty of dragging it out that's free wasn't on the notes but it's free for you he looked at our land and if he can't find no fault in Christ then you're free in the New Testament no matter what's wrong with you don't look at yourself look at your lamb we can't find any fault in him this scripture says in Ephesians chapter 2 and you ha he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins wherein in times past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience among whom that we all had our conversations in time pass and lust in our flesh fulfillment the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and were by Nature the children of Wrath even as others but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by Grace ye are saved and hath raised us up together and made us to sit in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come that he might show the exceeding Riches of Grace and kindness toward through Christ Jesus for by Grace ye are saved through faith and not of yourselves want you to go ahead and read the last part of it it is the gift of God now he says now if you got eternal life tonight and if we have eternal life than we always were right brother Ron but what about the good old days well my good old days were days I can't remember because I was in his mind amen but if you're talking about the Old King that was in this heart I'm not that guy no more I'm not even guilty of what that guy did if we have eternal life then we always were because there is only one form of eternal life we always were and the reason we were is because we were part of God and God is the only thing that's Eternal skip I want to skip a chap a a a thing there I need he said now we are part of God we always was you don't remember it because you were only an attribute in God but you were in his thinking you your very name if if it ever was on the book of life it was put there before the foundation of the world brother Ron we've heard that a million times well I'm not necessarily just reading it to you I'm reading that to the accuser that accuses you every day now young people I just want to say this to you the devil that is your accuser of the Brethren will talk you into doing something wrong and then we'll call the law and then he will he'll talk you into going the wrong side of wrong kind of websites and then start making you feel like you're nothing but mud but once God forgives you of that you don't never go back to it again and then when the enemy reminds you of what you used to do you remind him you're talking to the wrong guy [Applause] sometimes I just need to take a deep breath it's hard for me to imagine or especially self-righteous people to imagine that that Jesus's congregation now the guy that's going to be the lead spokesman of the church where does he go get him I can imagine the accuser of the Brethren going hm and they think he's the Messiah and he's picking the lead speaker of Acts 2 and he's naked and he's on a boat and he's cursing amen this he's going to be a habitual offender here until he gets the Holy Ghost in Acts 2 even the chosen series says his temper I have a lot of trouble with I'm sure Jesus had a lot of trouble with Peter's temper I'm GNA leave it what what about the sisters in his church well Mary Magdalene had Seven Devils in her that's right and she was listen living basically as an exile in her own community and nobody wanted nothing to do with her but she's going to be one of the leading ladies you talking about Grace you talking about people want to throw a stone amen okay okay you got one example let's go to another one he sends the disciples away and he goes to a well all of you are on the same page right now This Woman's been married five times living with another man she's not qualified in any church amen and Jesus goes and sits down in the well talks to her listen he has never told no no other human being I'm the Messiah but he's going to tell a woman that's that's now living with another man five times been married before but she needs to meet him because he'll fix her problem listen you can go to a thous churches you can put your name on a thousand books but until you meet Jesus and I talk about meeting Jesus meeting Jesus meeting Jesus more than a book more than a picture more than a sermon more than a song but when you meet him you'll never be the same ever again and she preaches back to him a woman in this condition preaches back to him but in a few minutes he reveals the secrets of her heart you know the light just comes on the light just comes on and now she wants to go into the City and tell everybody about this Jesus J Jesus handpicks one of these ladies to be the witness of Resurrection right he doesn't pick one of those high class preachers he doesn't pick Thomas he doesn't pick Peter he doesn't pick Nathaniel he doesn't pick none of them but he picks a woman that's got a history on he picks a woman with a history and he needs her and he tells her to come anoint the body cuz he know I'm not going to be there but I need her there and when she finds the grave there's nobody laying there she immediately begins to think somebody stole the body away somebody's done something with him but he needs her there he needs her her eyes to look in there and see he's not there she has to hear the angels say did not he tell you these things when he was in Galilee amen and brother brandham said he said angels are Among Us in church and we don't realize they're there they didn't know the Angels was there he was telling them prophecy now it's fulfilled why seek ye the living amongst the dead he's not dead but he needed you here let me just say he needs you here turn on turn to your neighbor say he needs you here cuz you're Witnesses of the rapture [Applause] I think this is phenomenal and I'm just going to jump I'm just going to boom boom boom through this when she recognized rabona Mary rabona that's him said touch me not because his body has to go to before God and he's carried that blood before God don't touch me now but I must have sin listen it don't take God a long time to do anything amen and literally in the next scriptures or so he's telling Thomas F me listen it's already paid for the blood is already there feel me I am your high priest I have paid for it the blood's on the throne the Grace has been paid for just a few moments ago she couldn't touch me but now you can put your hands on the word now you with your history now you got a right can I tell you one more story there was a king David we know all about Goliath wasn't that great last night pH I don't know how much better it can get amen I just say Lord change my body just change my body I can't hardly take it I I feel like kind of like thatting the way right now my chest feels like it's going to explode but I got a feeling it's him not the not the enemy David he had actually fought 18 Wars at this time I can imagine how big his castle was his headquarters the White House I can imagine how beautiful it was all the marble and all the gold and he was representing the King Jesus I can just imagine how many servants took care of him I can imagine the feast that happened on their mother's day I can imagine his table being phenomenally long great people would come in and sit at his table because he's a king and he's conquered he's the greatest King in the earth amen you talking about greatest King he's the greatest King cuz he has to represent Jesus and he's the greatest King that will ever be you see David had succeeded Saul Saul could have had all of this but jealousy backslidden spirit amen had took their away the scripture actually says that God rent The Kingdom from him let me just drop something to you don't you get yourself all worked up on politics it's of the devil are you with me it's of the devil and let me just say God causes men to rise and fall we think we're voting people in yeah it's fixed and I'm not talking about voting machines God's got men yeah that's going to rise like a pharaoh like a Putin like a pope that's going to rise to do his purpose there are only Pawns in the kingdom of God have no Eternal value but they're going to fulfill the promises of God Saul rose up because they wanted a king he rose up and God had to rent the kingdom away from him now David has a let me just say this to you if you could look back at the maps and I'm sure you have Andrew look back at the map of Israel it was huge in comparison to what Israel is today so you can imagine his Reign and how much power that he had how much force that he had the fear of David David got to thinking about when he was young there was a man in his life that was more than just a mentor but he was a friend they would call themselves Blood Brothers and his name was Jonathan and he would have phenomenal respect for Jonathan and on this day after 18 Wars has taken place he gets to thinking about I wonder I wonder if there's anybody of Saul's household that has still alive because as your tradition would be when one went out they would slay the entire family there would be none left amen are you with me that's what God wants to do with the demons that have fought you in their life he's not going to just chase them down and leave two or three he's one to get rid of them all my God is a warrior God I think you're going to like this brother Denny and he sent out word is there anybody that is still in Saul and Jonathan's family somebody remembered that there was a nurse that was taking care of a baby called feef can you imagine going to school and having to spell that and they jumped out the window and that boy become a for the rest of the days of his life he would have children he would have servants but he live in Exile in a place called loab bar I got a feeling that every person in this building has lived in loab bar it was as close as you could be to living off the grid to where that David and his men wouldn't find you amen he was living crippled he was living in shame his family has been destroyed his his his grandfather his father has shamefully disgrace the kingdom of God and when David's people begin to come back and said there's one left where is he at loar where's that will you take the best taxy that we've got and go get him take the best chariots that we've got take the best army you make sure that he comes to the castle you can imagine this entod showing up and you've been living in Exile you've been living in complete privacy and now you find out that the king knows where you're at am I going to die today and am I going to before an execution Squad amen we don't know exactly the king's plans sister CBR what a journey this is and he gets in and they begin to make their way to coord the greatest the greatest white house that has ever been built he's not going to walk on dirt floors no more he's not going to be in a hot room no more he's not going to have fear for his life no more amen and when he meets David David says I've been looking for you you're going to sit at my table you're going to eat eat my meat Lord and the land that was supposed to be yours I'm going to restore it to you everything that was coming your way I'm going to make sure you get [Applause] it can give me give just two more minutes I can imagine all these great people coming in for supper horns have blowed it's time to eat David in his fine robes and he's sitting at the head of the table and each one of these Mighty Men walk in and take their place and they're walking in and their fine armor and they're walking to their table and they hear something different today it's two club feet making his way to the king's table all the shame and all the regret and all the history book of his life has now found Grace from his waist up he looks like an ordinary man from his waist down he's a and the shame of being like this Andrew this has got a hold to my heart but when he walks into the table and he sits down at David's table the king's table and he slips them horrible looking feet up under the table you can't see his infirmity no [Applause] more I'm headed to a table yes I'm added to a table there was a lot of things in the history book I too was a prodal but he tore it out because he had a plan and you were a part of the plan thank you when I slip my feet up under the table I will have lived a life where the devil is under my feet [Applause] I have pondered I walk this morning I pondered some things when the cancer demon is brought up before the the judgments and all of his cohorts will he have me to stand and say run these guys are responsible for your sickness Rhonda did I help you overcome I said by Grace by Grace cancer will never defeat me I don't know what every one of your stories are but I want to tell you slip your feet under the table I'd like to tell you no matter where you're from and no matter what you've been through and no matter what's going on in your life welcome home welcome home here if anybody has a rock for you tell them to see me if anybody gives you trouble tell them to see Matthew but I want to tell you this

table welcome home give the Lord a great big hand clap this morning hallelujah hallelujah there's a whole lot of Rewritten books in this building a whole lot of Rewritten books I've I've heard some of your first chapters I've heard them what makes a pastor different than anybody else he can absorb all that and never throw him back at you that's what makes a real Pastor he can absorb all of the nonsenses of your life and never pick a day to throw it back at you but I'm nobody compared to Jesus I hope you got that I'm nobody compared to Jesus he can take all of our nonsenses and chapters of our life and and he won't even let accuser of our Brethren Go Fish in the [Music] hole watch in watch in your enemy would destroy you in a moment's notice if he could you're not alone God has got Angels at Bay watching over your children at school watching over your husbands and wives at work watching over your home watching over your lives cuz God has swore I'm going to take care of you and when the accuser comes before him he goes I don't remember that amen I don't remember that do you know Grace amen I want to finish with this none of us will ever live good enough to make it but we can fall at his feet and say thank you thank you you just moved into your new home brother Timothy it's beautiful it's beautiful but I can't wait to see you next one did you get it I can't wait to see
