house of the Lord and good to be here and so we thank the Lord for what he's doing for us and we miss those that are not here this evening and so so I'll preach to you or so we certainly love you with all of our hearts we want to remember brother Roger and Sister Ann and Lee and his wife and family and and just know that this is a very difficult time for them and uh just I just I thought I would share this with you two songs that she once Wanted sung at her funeral she always loved was amazing grace and I'll Fly Away lead this morning was playing some music piano music music foreign and after a bit he got a little bit tired of that piano music and he started praying some playing some country gospel when it came to I'll Fly Away that first course got done and all of a sudden the bed began to shake and that's what she did just slipped right away and so I'm glad that we can slip away from this wretched old body when it will no longer sustain life can you imagine living for thousands of years in a wretched body bent over him God provided a he provided an Uber driver for us to step through the door [Music] I want the right one to step through my door don't you when Jesus comes and calls my name I want to be ready I want to be ready for that day and amen God bless you we love you with all of our hearts Andrew is speaking tonight at the Ohio meeting in the Dayton area there Saint Mary's many of you were there many years ago in a medium we preached there they're having a phenomenal services and we're just we're just praying that tonight will be another one of them I'm expecting tonight here to be a great night amen I know there's some seats that are empty so we'll just invite angels to come and instead of having to stand tonight we'll just invite them to come and sit for a little while [Music] this week is an anniversary of brother Homer being gone for six years now [Music] about every night I dream about him and [Music] Thomas I don't know if you do that but I dream about him every night and he's constantly giving me instructions from that other realm and so amen last night we were working with a John Deere tractor and we were taking a chain around a rock and that rock and we were looking for we were looking for water water is a source of Life brother Donnie Reagan was with us and he said you know he said generally there's water behind a rock he's we just went ahead and pulled that rock over and it became a river amen and we were just rejoicing in all of that and so and may there be a river flow here this evening amen and God bless you maybe you have a need on your heart you'd just like to lift it before the Lord all of us are going through different things in our lives but God knows exactly what we have need of Heavenly Father we love you today you're so wonderful to us you're so personal you know our every situation today as brother Roger's daughter slipped Beyond the Veil of Tears today she would do it to her favorite song only you could orchestrate such an event like that now father you've orchestrated this service now I ask you that you would anoint your children's heart we can study and get us set aside and prepare but we have to have a a right mode of being ready to receive it I play Pray tonight that our ground is plowed just right ready to receive seed we're getting toward the Harvest now I pray as it matures May the proper rain and sunshine come touch our hearts today in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and amen amen God bless you so good to have you here tonight we love you with all of our hearts if you will turn with me to Isaiah chapter 53 and verse 1. would like to report to you on Wednesday we received a report that the brain tumors are stable and one of these days they're going to tell me they're gone and so we just believe that with all of our hearts and so oh man no new metastasis is there and so we're just thankful amen so we we'd be good boys we take our chemo we keep going we keep marching forward keep believing God's good at his word and so we just we're not we're not a bit disappointed we just keep going right forward and they've changed a couple medicines for me and so you pray that I can tolerate them as I go through it and uh it's just part of the journey but God's God give us the strength to do this and so amen he knew it before it ever came maybe even in this sermon you can kind of hear some of what I've went through because God ordained it to allow it that the music would sound a certain way amen Isaiah chapter 53 and verse 1. you may hear this this scripture a lot of times from the henceforth going forward but I want to read it so many times until the devil gets tired of hearing me read it who hath believed our report into whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of dry ground he hath no form of calmliness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief I love that word and acquainted with grief and he and we hid as if were our faces from him he was despised that we'd esteemed him not surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken and smitten of God and Afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed there will never come a time that this scripture won't become important to you amen God bless you you can be seated last Sunday we spoke to you on an orchestrated orchestrated place orchestrated lives for an orchestrated place and in the coming weeks that will even become even more important to you of how important that service was literally when I was pulling up the driveway this afternoon a brother from Texas brother Jeremy from Texas wrote me and told me how much that that service meant to him just really spoke to his Hearts tonight I'd like to speak to you on standing behind the curtains when we're not seeing and we're still playing the part because God molds us in a way to be able to play the part sometimes we look at other people and might even would like to be like them but you got to remember this you got to go through what they've went through [Music] to be like them and there's sometimes you don't want to go through what somebody else goes through oh but I want to be like that person but you don't understand what they've had to go through in their life sometimes it's unseen sometimes it's never told it's the Untold Story you might hear a Fanny Crosby and the phenomenal writer that she was I shall know him I shall know him I shall know him by the nail prince in his hands she was an extremely poor woman blind sense of very early birth let me just say this to you during the time of the Civil War she was offered much monies to be political and write songs for the political parties she could have used that money she could have used maybe the fame that would go along with that but she chose God she chose God and and choosing God is always the right answer and when she chose God no doubt a lot of people made fun of her a lot of people laughed and scorned why would she live such a backup honorable life why would she do that when she could have had a lot of incredible money but let me just say this your greatest reward of the testimony of Jesus Christ in our lives there was a sister from Florida her name was sister Brenda Lewis she's one of our most famous message songwriters she was extremely poor extremely poor but yet God gave her some of the greatest songs that could be pinned to paper and they said when they went and cleaned her house out that there was songs little little pieces of songs on every piece of paper newspaper pictures there was pieces of song when inspiration would come she would just start writing I'd say she spent a lot of time with God she spent a lot of time with fellowshipping with God she may not have been a preacher but she allowed that gift of that fellowship with God to so overflow in her life yet being poor yet having a lot of physical issues not being able to stand the last years of her life let me just say this you she did not let it deter one of her strongest songs that I listened to much it's gonna take a stronger wind than this Hallelujah Hallelujah brother Aaron Oglesby would preach a sermon that's one of my favorite Services of his when he would preach a sermon when I was diagnosed of cancer it's going to take a stronger wind than this brother says you you'll have to go through your ups and downs don't worry you've got to go through some Briar patches over some sharp rocks over Bluffs down hillsides up through the mountains over Waters walk with God there's so many Hills to climb they're upwork some of them are difficult how little it'll seem when you get to the end of the way brother man said listen I'm going to say something to you faith is unconscious he said you believe it he said I've learned that in the years of travel through the world and the meeting of peoples of of the different walks faith is unconscious you got to have faith you got faith and you don't know it that's right Jesus Christ no matter if he was in a storm or the Gale was knocking the boat from one side to the other or he was standing in the face of a mess of demons he was hanging anywhere he said it never moved him he walked right on just as calm and as quiet as he could be he was simply unconscious of fear anything around him he said whether it was going to happen or whether it wasn't going to happen he noted was going to happen because God said so he said so he didn't say I wonder if I need to pray through I prayed through I wonder if I fasted long enough I wonder if I did this I wonder if I've walked right on unconscious he believed what God Said was truth the words must be fulfilled he knowed what his life was to fulfill them and he said that's right and if you're here now notice he turns it to you and if you're here to fulfill it too just walk unconscious of him walk unconscious of criticism walk unconscious of the world walk as you walk in Christ walk with him pay no attention to the left or the right hand just keep moving on if something comes up into church walk with God if sickness strikes you walk with God this is a powerful sermon hang right with it now he said if the neighbor don't like you walk with God just keep walking with God this is good this good nuts bolts just walk with God Enoch walk with God and one day he took a walk home huh Enoch one day walk with God you know what he done he walked all the way home with God got so far up the road he didn't want to come back anymore walk with God the doctor says you're going to die walk with God Hallelujah I can preach that that quote stands in my ears one night the doctor one of the lady doctors came into my room and she sat down on the side of my bed and sister Connie was laying laying in the couch laying in the whatever couch there was there to sleep beside me and we were to prepare to have have another brain surgery she walked in and she sat down and she talked to me she said they've told you that you've got just a few months to live and I said yeah she said but I feel like that I'm the sickest patient in the room she said I need what you've got she talked to me about what the last days would might be like none of them had an idea that I would stand here two and a half years later still preaching you see that's our God and doctors want to help you that's that's what they want to do they want to help you and they want to they want to help humanity and dying Humanity try to make tomorrow better for you they've done a lot of wonderful things for me but let me just say the god that we serve he is a faithful God you're going to have some bad days you're going to have some difficult moments in your life get back up get up don't lay down get up it may hurt to get up but get up it may be difficult to walk through tomorrow it may be difficult what you've got to go through just keep getting up [Applause] brother Brandon says now notice again when all hell turns loose all Heaven turns loose when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of God raises up a standard against it there would have been no rainbow until a flood came but after Noah was pressed into that condition that he was in to float 40 Days A Night in the storm and the little Ark pitching up and down in the water it was after the flood was over that he saw the rainbow for the first time the Covenant of Hope the Covenant of promise he had went through a tribulation but then he saw the Covenant he saw the promise let me just say this to you God's big enough he's big enough if he makes a promise he'll keep it when he told us in Isaiah 53 when he told us in Isaiah 53 he'd be our Healers he knew that he was coming and he would be beaten like no other man would be beaten because you and I Adam had fell and throwed the whole human race into a fallen condition but God provided a lamb not a lamb of some man God came himself [Applause] providing lamb the blood that could take away the sins of the world amen Psalms chapter 34 and verse 19. many I want you to read this scripture with me many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord delivereth them out of them all [Music] read it again many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord delivereth him out of them all we can dismiss right now and just go ahead and Shout for a while [Applause] brother Brown said why does God let troubles come God harnesses troubles punch bits in its mouth makes it obey him and those troubles bring us into closer fellowship with God your troubles get you closer to God [Applause] Hallelujah and remember God's got the control he won't let Satan go too far he won't even let him come and take you home one day early until your purpose is finished on this Earth Hallelujah Job chapter 23. boy I'll just tell you this right now this is a powerful scripture but he knoweth the way that I take and when he had dropped me I shall come forth this goal can you read it with me but he knoweth the way that I take and when he hath tried me I shall come forth as goat so the god that knows your beginning he knows your end he's got a seat at the marriage supper of the Lamb he has prepared a new city for you he knows that one day you walk on streets of gold you'll walk through forests that doesn't have a leaf dropping off of it you're talking about seeing big big time bucks Jerry we're going to see big time bucks Hallelujah you're talking about seeing Big Time mountain goats and their their horns curled a certain way and be an absolutely perfect we're gonna see them Hallelujah you won't need a picture you won't need a gun they're going to be there for eternity just watch black squirrels white squirrels red squirrels gray squirrels big squirrels little squirrels foreign now God's telling us something in the scripture he knoweth the way that I take and there are times that we don't always take the right Channel so he sends an angel to bump you once in a while to get you back in Step even a prophet in the vision was screaming get back in line get back in line Ministry tell them get back in line David shares his heart we see David as an incredible King we see him as incredible Warrior let's just read a few lyrics of sheet music if we can to the chief musician a Psalm of David when Nathan the prophet had came unto him after he'd gone and unto to Bathsheba notice what he begins to pray have mercy upon me oh God David was quick to repent according to the love and kindness according to the multitude of thy Tender Mercies blot out my transgressions Wash Me thoroughly from my iniquity cleanse me from my sin for I acknowledge my transgressions and my sin is ever before me against thee and thee only have I sinned and done this evil in thy sight and that thou mayest be justified when thou speaketh and when clear when thou judges behold I was shaping in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me behold thou desires truth and the inward parts and the hidden part that thou shalt make me to no wisdom Purge me with hyssop and I shall be clean wash me and I shall be wider than snow listen he's writing about a blood that hasn't been shed yet the bloody bulls and goats could only take care of it for a moment but Jesus is coming Purge me with his hiccip and I shall be clean wash me and I shall be whiter than snow make me to hear the joy of gladness and the bones which the the house has broken my May Rejoice hide thy face from far from my sins and blot out my iniquities created me a clean heart hey man created me a clean heart oh God and renew a right Spirit within me that is a powerful scripture for every one of us up to date tonight ever get in a bad mood ever take up are you with me ever have a bad attitude creating me a clean heart somebody say something against you don't get in their world don't lower yourself down to their standards I'm gonna preach to you now creating me a clean heart cast me not away from thy presence and take not the holy spirit for me restoring to me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with a free spirit teach then will I teach transgressors thy ways Sinners shall be converted unto thee deliver me from the blood guiltness oh God that thou of God of my salvation and my tongue shall sing aloud to thy righteousness oh Lord open thou my lips and my mouth shall show forth thy praise for thou desires not sacrifice else what I did with divot thou did lightest not in burnt offerings the sacrifices of God are a broken Spirit a broken and contrite heart oh God that will not disturb this Paul would write these words for though I would desire to Glory I should not be a fool I will say the truth but now I forbear lest that any man should think about of Me Above measure see if me to be or of Hearth of me unless I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations there was given to me a thorn in the flesh a messenger of Satan here is the first church age messenger and he's just being very honest God allowed the devil to put a thorn in my flesh that I would not get exalted [Music] it says Buffett that word Buffett means he would be buffeted for a bit and it would leave and then it would come back again how many of you ever have sinuses especially in the fall and here it comes it leaves you all year long and then all of a sudden you've got a cold that won't leave you through the night you're sniffling you're being buffeted by an allergy condition when I was a little boy went to school I would go to school and I had allergies that would literally swell my eyes shut and I hear brother Raymond talk about grease mom would take uh not lard but but it was Lord it was Crisco and she'd take Crisco and put it on my eyes and pull my eyes apart and I would go to school and I would sneeze and sneeze and sneeze and and and and and I was redheaded so and I was the littlest guy in the classes so people would pick on me and then then one day we were taken to the doctor and and the doctor gave me a antihistamine and it was a activate it was the initial appeal to come back that you were to take one at night and one in the morning so I slept good all night and I slept good all day [Laughter] Paul had a condition in his eyes it's been debated throughout history of what the condition was caused by but it was a condition that can you imagine standing preaching the gospel of a God that heals a God that saves a God that cast out Devils that should be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that these signs shall follow them that believe and he was standing there with pus running down out of his eyes you see God knows how to mold the player to be able to play in the orchestra that he won't do it with his own will he will only do it by the will of God [Applause] notice his words for this thing I besought the Lord Thrice that it might depart from me and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for my strength is made perfect in weakness now his response Paul has a response most gladly therefore I would rather glory in mine infirmities that the power of Christ May rest upon me notice these next words this is a difficult to listen to therefore I take pleasure in my infirmities in reproaches in necessities in persecution in distress for Christ's sake for when I am weak let me just say we can't do this on our own [Music] we can't do this on our own but when I am weak when I would give up then I am strong First Peter chapter 1 and verse 7. the trial of your faith First Peter 1 7. the trial of your faith being more much more precious than of gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ remember Abraham God knew who Abraham was but Abraham didn't know who he was God knew who Abraham was but Abraham didn't know who he was the scripture says in Isaiah chapter 43. but now thus saith the Lord that created Theo Jacob and he that formed the O Israel fear not notice these next words I have redeemed thee I have called thee by thy name and thou art mine you wasn't looking for God God was looking for you are you with me now oh my brother Ron I got myself here no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no none of us have got ourselves here it was God rich in Mercy [Applause] many of you are a one out of a family or one out of a job or one out of a school and God raised you up for a purpose to play a part in God's Orchestra and whether you know it or not you are playing with people around the world you may never meet them in this life but one day you'll meet them there and you have played in a symphony not one above Another We're complementary to one another Brethren but I'm in a storm I want you to say these words with I am coming out of this storm I am coming out of this storm I want to just bring you some basics of this before the storm ever come before the lightning ever struck before the darkness ever came around you before the clouds ever assembled God knew you was getting ready to go through it if you're gonna have difficulties in your life before you ever get to your difficulty remember the devil in all of his hints are only a toolbox never get the devil a whole lot of credit never show him any Mercy he's only a toolbox you don't worship your toolbox it's got screwdrivers it's got hammers it's got crowbars and so that toolbox is used to mold character in your life now think about this Michelangelo worked on a piece of Rock because Moses was in there nobody else saw Moses in that rock many people passed by and saw Michelangelo working huge piece of Rock what are you working on I'm working on Moses you're standing there you didn't see Moses but Moses was in there the man with the vision all he had to do was get the excess off of him are you with me all he had to do was get the excess off of him [Applause] that's what God does to you he's just getting the mud off of you and the dirt off of you and he's washing the excess off of you I'm not talking about your weight now he's he's just getting the sins off of your life the attitudes off of your life why does he have to do that here because you can't do it in the Rapture mode so you got to get ready here to go play that [Applause] [Music] thank you now God has a promise with you and sometimes your ship may be breaking apart God don't have a promise with the ship he has a promise with you your job might be just tearing apart and literally leaving you the promise ain't with your job or your company it's with you politics may not be going your way the promise ain't with the politics the promises with you just stay with me a little bit your temporary surroundings in your life are not Eternal surroundings your house is not going in a Rapture your car no matter what kind you drive is not going in a Rapture your shoes that you wear is not going in a rapture you are going in a rapture [Applause] our infinite god brother Bill under stands trouble why don't you just go ahead and say say that right there my God understands trouble because I want you to repeat that to the devil the next time that you have a difficult day with him my God understands trouble and the trouble of this day is only temporary tomorrow will be better oh I may be busy it's a dizzy is a bumblebee I might be throwing up but my saying is tomorrow we'll be better God knows the end sister Connie he knows the end from the beginning um when you came here you didn't understand a lot of things what has Greg got me into but this ain't the end this is just another journey in your life another chapter and now we got to get busy to play our part we just got to get busy I don't want to waste a day I don't want to waste a week I don't want to waste a month oh are you with me when the lights come on and the orchestra's playing I want to be in my seat I want to be ready let me just say this to you it's work training is work people that run in an olympic race they work to get there they don't accidentally get there you don't accidentally run a four minute mile a concert pianist they have to play over and over and over every day the same peace they gotta work until their muscle in their fingers have a have a memory of where to go at the next piece it's work they don't just accidentally walk up and say well I'm going to play Beethoven it's work to do that when you hear a preacher preach and he's preaching it didn't take two weeks to get that sermon together it took his entire lifetime [Music] find it amazing that people can criticize you as a preacher they've never won one soul they've never been baptized one individual they've never went out of their way for the cause of the Gospel of Jesus Christ but yet they can tell you how to do it but there have been sin along as your Briar for the day and if that fellow's watching tonight that was for you [Applause] now you've got a promise these statements are coming out of God's provided way about 10 different sermons so you just stay with me you got a promise but you must keep your focus when difficulties come you got to keep your focus you got a part to play you got a mission to play you got a job to play you got a role to play God's put you here in laodicea to overcome laodicea there's going to be times in your storms you're going to lose some stuff brother Brandon lost a lot of friends in his life preaching the truth do we hear him quit we hear Paul say Demas has forsaken me loving this pleasure of this world brother bam said demons love to hear his name called that's what he said brother man had friends that walked away from him after he preached certain truths certain doctrines men would walk away from him they were friends you're going to lose some friends in the storm but ask yourself was they really your friend this is not everybody's going to walk you through you to the end listen if they can walk away they didn't value your friendship so they pretended for that length of time to be your friend and then when the little Shuffle comes all of a sudden they gone don't blame it on me baby I'm still standing here [Applause] tell a lot of things on me let me just say this you I've been here all this time I'll be here till the rapture I will still be preaching this truth I have nothing to hide I'm as transparent as I can be I'm as real as I can be brother Ron that was pretty rough well let me give you the words of my predecessor he said on your way out don't let the door hit you in the butt [Applause] now for people all over the world maybe in Europe or in we're in the fighting part of Heaven we will have your back when nobody else will have it we will make a lot of noise here praising the Lord that just put your Stones away God's raised us up here for a purpose and I ain't changed for nobody and I ain't gonna change for you baby [Applause] well if so and so comes in you won't preach as hard let me just say if so and so comes in they're going to have to get the same dose I've been preaching since out in 1984. I've been preaching this I Ain't No rookie [Applause] the reason you're still standing if God knows that you can handle the pain because you know his grace is sufficient you've lost a lot of temporary things you might say brother Danny steamman called it stuff and fluff life is not perfect in case you haven't figured this out life ain't perfect brother but I'm telling us this there's no church perfect so if you leave looking for a perfect church when you get there it's not going to be perfect no more that's not my statement that's been around for a while but it's good enough I'll use it you're not perfect somebody somebody just put you you're not perfect oh bro Ron I'm perfect look in the mirror baby I'm gonna get married my mate's gonna be perfect young ladies that are not married today you're dreaming of a perfect mate I want to give you just a little piece here one day I asked your daddy for a chainsaw get your daddy to start it up put it on the bed beside of you preferably with a with a canvas under it now lay down and go to sleep [Applause] I had a friend of mine his name is Milko I'd heard it so many times that milco was a great snorer I did not know it to being in Switzerland and he was in the floor below concrete building 12 inches of concrete between me and him besides the six foot to the bed I put pillows on my head and it didn't work I turned the fans on it didn't work I finally just turned brother Branham on and turned it loud enough tall he drowned it off Milko but milco during the day was one of the most lovable teddy bears that you ever ever ever known you would never say a word about him but let that baby go to sleep I just dropped that in because I could drop a lot of stories right here everybody loves brother Terry's work brother Terry is a perfectionist in his work but if you've never heard his story about being an orphan child about being left alone if he talks to you about 30 minutes about his life story that's what made him who he is
