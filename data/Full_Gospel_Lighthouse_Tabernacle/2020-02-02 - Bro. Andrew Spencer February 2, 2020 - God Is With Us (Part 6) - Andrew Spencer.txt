together the Lord of Hosts is with us the God of Jacob is our refuge say la hey man let's bow our heads this evening Heavenly Father we come to you tonight Lord and we humble our hearts Lord Jesus before the great I am Lord and we just ask God at this moment in time that you would look upon us and that you administer life and peace father to our hearts Lord we know that your word will bring us the victory father and we know that your word will console our hearts and we know that the enemy cannot stay on these grounds for these are holy grounds and Lord Jesus we know that if we begin to push at him with the Word of God that he has to leave the Bible tells us to submit ourselves therefore to God and resist the devil and he will flee Lord we pre we are persistent in our resisting him and father one more time we stand behind this pulpit Lord Jesus and we ask God that you would come and anoint us for service every single one of us father bless those that will hear this by the way of the internet Lord Jesus this week and now father we pray you bless this congregation abundantly and may we see the acts of the Holy Ghost moving amongst us here this evening may the Spirit of God fill just absolutely welcomed here may there be such a Liberty in this place tonight to move in any way possible may you minister in Jesus Christ's name Amen god bless you you may be seated in the presence of the Lord the brothers have that quote was shared with them said if if God designed man's body he certainly designed the body of his son the church he designed to us to come together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus and have the supernatural workings of God outlets through gifts of the Spirit such as prophecy and wisdom and knowledge and and gifts of healing and all of these other different gifts as outlets that God lets out his power and lets out his revelation to the people and not as an individual so much but as a unit we're all together one great body of believers and how do we get into this body in the mystic body of the Lord Jesus by one spirit we're all baptized into this body now notice this now Satan by the laws of sin and death makes everything that sin and death brought operate to sin that's through Satan's sins a cancer to operate to Satan and he sends a cancer the man recognized it receives it Satan sends heartaches we recognize it and receive it and if Satan by his power can make his laws work in a man how much more art God with his power make his laws work in man if Satan can make his laws be sure and us recognize it how much more God to his children to make his laws be recognized amongst his people of divine healing and revelation and power and gifts and manifestations of the Spirit the law of sin and death works in the people and the law of the Liberty of Christ has come unto us to set us free from those things if man can recognize what God has done how much more as the children of God's would do recognize what God has done what what God has given us if these things are laying there for us if these things are promised for us how much more should we recognize it this is this is not just a battle that we're facing this is not just a battle that you're facing this is a this is an attack all the way around the bride of Jesus Christ and if we can realize that that this is Satan at work this is this is the best that he's got this is the best that Satan as God is - to make you sick he's his best is to make you afflicted but the least little touch of God is omnipotent the best that Satan is God is the best that he's got but the least little thing of God tonight can cast Satan out my finger if we could begin to recognize our position and who we are and what we're put here for you were not put here to live in defeat but you are put here as a mighty jin-tae warrior bride to overtake and to overthrow Satan's Kingdom and do with it as you please [Music] hallelujah now the Bible says in Ephesians 1 and 18 that the eyes of your understanding being lightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us word who believe according to the working of his mighty power now I absolutely love the book of Ephesians it is personally my favorite book in the Bible I have spent much time there because that is a parallel to the book of Joshua it is our inheritance here we are here Paul is laying out to us our inheritance of of who we are these are our borders this is where we work at this is where we live at and I love what Paul said here that this exceeding greatness of his power to us were to believe according to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in heavenly places notice far above all principality above every angel above every demonic power and power and might and Dominion and every name that is named not a notices that not only in this world but also in that which is to come and hath put all things line up everything he got line up everything Satan's got line up everything the world's God has put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all all things to the church that word over in the Greek it is very chiefest it is beyond it is exceedingly abundantly that he is the head the very chiefest over all things that he is beyond all things he is exceedingly abundantly above all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that filleth all in all you see God loves he loves to show his power he loves to manifest his goodness and his truth and His grace and His wisdom that's one thing as a believer you found about God is that God loves to display his power but not only does he love to display it about himself he loves as a as a great big God that can come all the way down to humanity you see that's what makes him not to me he's so great but yet he became become so small that he feels all time space and eternity but yet he wants to live on the inside of these 16 elements and he wants to show his power his glory his wisdom his truth his goodness hallelujah his holiness his purity his justice hallelujah God's not somewhere far off up in heaven deities in you and if you can realize the day that heaven is not that far away but heaven is on the inside of you come on somebody a lot of people will look at the seals they look at this well I don't understand all these things let me give it to you straight the revealing of the seals is not just some book it is Christ and if you can ever get that figured out that in this day Christ has been revealed to you this is not God way back there back some back is some of the eggs this is God right now this is Jesus revealed to you this is the son of man that is continuing to speak Tom time and time again and he's still speaking any Bible reader and who reads the Bible knows that God loves to display his power another man have said that he brings men into situations that they cannot figure out in order to show them that he loves him and he leads them who he loves to display his power he displayed his power when Daniel used the Lions hard to lay down the pole are you with me he displayed his power when there was a little ruddy boy that overtook a giant he displayed his power there he displayed his power and the man called Jesus when he was away was weary from the revival before and he stepped up on the brow of the boat and he stood up there and he said peace be still hallelujah and he's dead he displayed his power in front of his disciples and the same one is speaking today if he could stand upon that natural boat how much more can he stand upon your spiritual boat this evening why don't you let the son of man begin to speak peace to your situation peace to your life peace to your home peace to your family peace to your marriage he's willing hallelujah you look at Israel in their journey which was a type of this of this journey today how notice how he would lead them right into death strap who that's swallow that one it's good for you then display is power he led them into deathtrap and then he displayed his power when notice when Pharaoh would say I will let them go and then God says no no I'm going to harden his heart just in order to show his great power I love what brother Marsh said last night if it would not have been a fire if God would have saved the three Hebrew children before the fire you'd have never heard of them if God would have saved us from everything we that we would have went through in life we'd have never known him in his attributes as a savior but because He loves us he leads us in the spots where he can display his glory because he loves me whoo hallelujah in order to show his great power I believe that's why that God is letting things happen the way they are today that when the great rush finally comes he loves to show his power and display his love to the sons of men and the conflict between God and Satan he said but Satan is more than a match for us we know we know that Satan is way more than a match for any human being don't you never try to do it with your wisdom to outsmart him you just can't do it and Jesus knew this so he sent to the church that Satan would not outsmart them he sent them a place to be fortified he sent them the Holy Ghost and the Church does not claim to be smart they just claim to believe it you see if you could ever figure out that Satan is not scared of your 16 elements Satan is not scared your human flash Satan is not scared he's not scared of even your earthly spirit he's not scared of you in your flesh brother Nathanael but as a gene seed of God if you could ever realize as an Son of God that you've got more power than the Angels do in heaven Satan ain't scared of me as a Spencer but has a son of God he'd better not mess with me [Applause] hello you see in my human flesh he is more than a match for me but notice is in my genes seat of God I'm more than a match for him hallelujah if you don't believe me I'll give you a quote floor there are you standing this morning there stands the tracks of the Living God I don't care what anyone else says what the doctor says what anything what the unbelievers has won more than a match for anything that comes along where Abraham seed and we shall possess the gate of our enemy no matter what the enemy is God gave the promise that was theirs their possession healings your possession salvations your possession the Holy Ghost is your possession glory when Moses was there when the backside of a desert and he was there and had the pillar fire the burning bush experience and he began to speak - hello him and he says who will I say sit me tell them that I am that I am has sent me that I am the present one I'm an ever-present help in the time of trouble I'm there when you need me I'm there when you don't I'm always there I am his presence it's not past tense it's not future it's right now and they still the great I am when he was there with Moses he said I am when he was there and Jesus he said I am and when he was here in this day he said I am that I am he only changed his mask to empty himself are you with me to believe to a believer that would open up themselves and allow the Holy Ghost to come in brother Branham said that God's strategy is to take empty vessels and fill them up and shake hell with them alright who's willing to be an empty vessel this evening hallelujah now notice as we go on further in the book of Exodus we find that Moses goes down to each to take over we go down there and we find that that we found Moses here and then begins to display the power of God and the plagues and the power of God is being shown which I'm over to answer this chapter 9 in verse 13 and the Lord said unto Moses rise up early in the morning I'm not going to give you all the background but you just jump right in you know the story quite well but all these other plagues have taken place and now they're at this spot and the Moses is still before Pharaoh and say let my people go and and the Lord said unto Moses rise up early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh saying to him thus save the Lord God of the Hebrews let my people go that they may serve me notice there's a lot of people that are still bound because they do not want to come out and serve Him there's a lot of people that want to be healed there's a lot of people that want to be delivered and all they want is that but they don't want to come out and serve Him there have been countless times and that people will just pass through this church or pass through other churches and they they have a need in mind and they know that there is a balm in Gilead so they come to where they know that there's divine healing yet you remember that there was a lady that came here one time that had a brain aneurysm and she came here said a brain aneurysm and the doctors were surprised that she was even living and she came here and was actually asked if we would baptize her we had to be very delicate with the situation we baptized her annually she went back to the doctors and the brain aneurism was completely gone that's my god she reached out and touched God she got her healing and never came back we baptized somebody here some years ago now we they they had they had cancer they had heart trouble and they came here and they knew that they needed to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we baptize them in a watery grave and they then they rose rose up there the next week they went back to the doctor and cancer was gone and the heart trouble was gone they reached out just for a moment as Jesus was passing by and they touched him but they were not willing to serve him now if they could reach into that realm what about you as sons and daughters of God that are not just willing to be healed but willing to come out and serve Him willing to stand up for him oh I hate and I the things of God are limited to you if you can reach out my faith let me move on for our out this time verse 14 for our at this time send all my plagues upon my heart and upon my servants and upon all upon my people that thou may us know that there is none like me and all the earth notice this is what Moses is saying to Pharaoh for now I will stretch out my hand then I might smite thee in my people with a pestilence and that thou shall be cut off from the earth now I absolutely love verse 16 I love it in such a way because this scripture right here will sake hail down he will make it will make it will make a police officer if he stops he be stops a car and he smells marijuana in the car he's got legal rights to search that car now if you read this scripture and you don't realize your legal rights that you got a right to shake hell down with you are not reading this scripture as it is said to you notice and in and in very deed for this cause have I raised the up for to show in the my power and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth has yet exalt is now myself against my people that thou will not let them go you know it's amazing when Hale thinks it's winning when Hale thinks that it's done decided that I'm not going to let them go they're my people I'm not gonna let them go and then Hale has to hear God say that I raised you up for a purpose I raised a role for a purpose I race cancer for a purpose I'm really outraged emergences for a purpose I rise sugar diabetes for a purpose my trouble for a purpose that my name might be glorified in all the earth Hale is got to recognize something big is coming and it's God hell I want you to hear me tonight you were raised for the call to glorify the name of Jesus you have no legal right to touch me hallelujah halo was raised for this cost oh that's got to be humiliating for the enemy when he really thinks he's got the upper hand on you and then to find out he was only raised for this cost that the name of Jesus whoo to show God's power to show his strength to show his testimony the think of this would not have happened if God would not have hardened Pharaoh's heart you would have never known these things if Anna just walked out if it had just walked out but because of this God's name was magnified and glorified if this wouldn't have happened that God always gets the glory he always gets the glory a lot of people don't want to profess anything and I don't believe in just letting negativity come across her lips but you ought to recognize the devil that you're fighting with and you can either say well I've got heart trouble or heart troubles got me or you can either say I got cancer or cancers got me I choose to say that is Full Gospel Light House we got cancer by the throat of the neck we ought to be bold in your worship you know who you are don't you be scared of him he's scared of you don't you get nervous he's nervous don't you get shook up he's shaken up when the weakest of Christians those on their knees he'll trembles what about you veterans what about your mamas and daddies let's shake hell down what coming to take over hallelujah hallelujah oh it imagine it's throughout the years there's hardly a service it's ever that's ever preached that the name Moses how are the children of Israel's not mentioned why because there was a miracle that took place brother Branham said before you can see a miracle you got to become a miracle but I want you to look at this in this way that that we point back to these miracles we point back and we realize that the god of Moses and the God of Abraham and the god of Isaac and the God of Jacob is still the same God but we point back to those miracles and think about the faith that it raised are you with me think about the faith that are raised in Rahab and all of Jericho was all scare but a habit release her faith that she could drop down a token oh come on help me preach tonight it brought faith to her that she realized that there was something out there in that camp that would get her hat of her pestilence that would get her out of her careers ever get her out of her prostitution she realized that they had something that she was lacking it was because of these miracles that Gideon would point back and say where if God be with us then where be all of his miracles he knew that he had to be the same God and if he was God then where is all of his miracles have and here Didius he's giving God the answer he's given him and presenting him this question and then God answers him because he was pointing back to a miracle that had happened and if you look at the children of Israel the children of Israel were trained by trouble it sculpted them and cultivated them and they learned how to fight but they were not just out beating at the air they were landing the the only time that they were beating at the air was when sin came into the camp and anybody can fight I said in a land full of Fighters anybody can fight but we're we're not talking about somebody that's just willing to roll up the sleeves here we're not talking about that anybody anybody in the right mind that knows knows better on in the natural would fight for him but we're not just looking for somebody that's willing to fight for him in the natural we're looking for somebody and when you win I want you to I want you to hear this every time you hear me say but they're wrong Spencer now I am NOT just addressing him I am addressing the I am addressing the issue because you see this is not just a battle against brother Ron Spencer this is a this is a battle against you this is a battle against the bride of Jesus and I hope you follow me in my in my thinking on that because you see this is more than just on one person this is affecting you this is affecting conventions this is affecting meetings this is affecting the world but we are not just dealing with a cancer in the flesh but we are fighting against an enemy that is trying to bring cancer to a generation to a people to grab a hold of him as the prophet would say and be a craft of him and drug the very life out of them that is what Satan is one to do don't look at the small picture look at the big picture of what Satan is trying to do he is trying to grab a hold of your spiritual life he is trying to grab a hold of you as an individual and destroy your family I got people in my in in my in my work for sir in the work community that would die for me that would die for Matthew in my dad in that in that realm because of what we mean to them I believe you've got friends like that that would actually give their life just defending you but you know in this type of battle you're not looking for somebody that knows how to pull out the brass knuckles you're looking for somebody that knows how to pool the house Hebrews chapter four and 12 they know how to pull out that sword they know how to get it and use it and they're not holding it by weekend they're holding it by straw head anybody can just spout off at the mouth a lot of people are real good at that a lot of people don't know when to shut that thing a lot of people don't know when to stop talking or stop typing they don't know when anybody can spout off at the mouth and anybody can quote logos but I'm looking for somebody that'll reach in there and grab that spiritual war like Hattie Wright's head and she said the right word are you with me tonight we're not fighting us in the natural were fighting us in a supernatural and a vein a spiritual realm this is not a natural battle this is a spiritual battle buckle it up it's time for battle it's a time to land punches realize that we're engaged in a warfare anybody can say they got faith but let that faith speak let that faith go to work faith is works Express you can have faith but let it loose let that faith loose that that faith speak let that faith move you remember brother Branham he had that old dog come fritz he said he'd chase everything now he said he'd chase everything down but he would not chase telescope he said he'd get up here and he'd chase after and he'd get him up in a bush but he would not go in there her brother branham he said now he said I would say sick and Fritz and he'd run right in there and he'd go after that skunk you're in wrath he said go in there get him fritz sick in French sick and fritz he said now the biggest devil the biggest cook that I know of is the devil and he said when I hear people say a name man go for it go after him he said it shows to me that we've got the devil treed and it's just a sword moment we've got entry tonight my Magic's proven to me that you've got the devil tree you've got him in a corner a man sick and broad go after him prod [Applause] it's a time to let God loose on the enemy it's a time to let the great I am loose on him a lot of times people got God boxed up in their mentality of their of their mind that God's got to do this before it can do that or God's gotta move on this way before he can move that if you as a human being listen maybe it's just works in my mind if you can get him out well God's got to do this and God's got to do that and God's got to make this happen before I see the miracle if you could take God out of your little man-made box take him out of that box and say God you're the god of help you're the god of the universe you ain't gotta work to man mentality I'm gonna walk to your mentality and let God loose and you'll watch the miracle come to pass see you're standing in a position and I want you to realize where you're at in this battle that we're facing you are standing in a great position you're in a position as a people for God to reveal himself to you now Satan no mind you going to church he don't mind you coming here on Saturday and Sunday he don't mind you getting your car he don't even mind you turning on your gospel music he don't mind you flipping through the pages of the Bible he don't mind you joining the choir young people he don't mind you joining the choir he don't mind you getting emotional down here and getting happy he don't mind those things but when you start receiving the Lord for the hour that's where Satan gets all hot and bothered he starts having a heat flash and all my goodness he just can't keep cool down is when you start receiving the word for the hour who I'm preaching to every woman over 50 right now understand all of that but I want you to realize that when you start receiving the Lord for the hour and putting that word for the hour that's when he goes into a hot flash he starts realizing that there's of people that can fan the flames higher that could push him right back down the hill where he came from well I'm sure I'm gonna hear about that one you're standing in a position that God can reveal himself to you and Satan hates that you see Satan tried his very best to keep Joshua from going into the homeland he given false reports he brought up negative testimonies he brought out rumors of giants in that land but Joshua was not bothered by their by their negative testimonies Joshua was commissioned and verse just will won't involve this he'll not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as always with Moses who I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake me Joshua was commissioned to stand there and to go in and take it over and Satan was doing his best to keep him out of that land because Satan knew that once Joshua got in he would not get him out I just dropped you a whole wheelbarrow load Satan knows if you get into this message he ain't gonna get you out of this message if you really dive in ain't no way he gonna get you out why don't you dive on here tonight Saints gone his best to keep the revealed word in this hour away from you [Applause] once you get in he ain't gettin you out that's why you see such a struggle with your family with your product course with your in-laws you see such a struggle because Satan is wanting to keep him out of it he may do his very best but if they Lord name before the foundation of the world he can do all he wants to to him once they give in he can't get him out my Jesus let me just let me just transition here I feel I feel Liberty to go here so we're going wait how wait for these moments and now is the time I was listening to the Prophet the other day and he said there's a little lady as a little lady he was playing with a little lady he said you were just back there wondering when it was your time he said but now's your time now's your time you may be wondering when it's your time to get the sword out and start cutting it down now it tells you by the Spirit of the Lord now is your time you have to wait no more I hear the rustling in the mulberry trees rise rise now's your time take it over this is your book it's not a closed book it's an open book eat this book become this book it's gonna do it's gonna be a war inside of you but keep pushing it down it's this word that will whip the devil anytime anyplace under any condition I got a phone call from my buddy today this even as I was preparing getting ready to leave for church but the Jason Jackson called me and I've told I've told many ministers if you got something a supernatural miracle and mean something to you I want you to send it to me maybe I may not remember it but I want it in my spirit so that when Hale comes against us you say I may forget it but there was an anointing that comes that will bring it out at your need and at that moment as brother Jason he called me said I got to share something with you he said this happened today he said our church service he said one of our Deacon sisters one of our Deacon sisters that came came up for prayer he said she had had knee surgery about seven weeks ago I believe and said that she had she had knee surgery and she had and she had so much pain from that it was bothering her hip and everything she had so much exclusive pain that was she was not able to get up and do her daily activities and go to church and whatnot but she was she was laying there this morning and and she was in her pain and she said she begin to think about her sister she begin to think about her sister that had all kinds of different problems that was going on and something spoke to her to go to church and don't pray for yourself but pray for your sister that hard all these problems go up there and stand for your sister and his brother Jason was preaching and coming down to the end of the had an altar call and people were coming up for prayer he said she began to say to him she said brother Jason I'm not here for my own self in my pain I come here for my sister and I'm standing here and out of her mouth she said that my sister will be better my sister will tell me that she's better after this church service when she was standing there in that moment all of the pain that she had in her knees and all throughout her body was completely dissipated at that moment [Applause] she went back to her pew she went back to her pew and she got got back her to her pew and all the sudden she started speaking in another language and she reached out and grabbed some napkins had put them over her mouth she stood after that service with no pain she stood throughout that service with no pain and she took those napkins to her sister and when she handed them to her sister her sister let it out of her mouth now already feel better when you go to intercession for somebody else God looks on you God is with us we've seen this God heal degenerative bone disease what doctors were saying there when doctors would say that that is that this individual would need two knee replacements that they would need their spine fuse and the Lord came down and healed them instantly during the preaching of the word what about you what about your knee Peter said the wall while the Bible said that while Peter yet spoke these words the Holy Ghost fell but the bill Hershberger's daughter her legs he was born her leg was shorter than the other by two or three inches and while the bridging of the Lord's who went toed she went until the doctor and she was going to be healed and after the preaching of the word went forth her leg grew out to a normal condition I'm giving you miracles that happened not 50 years ago but right now things that are happening right in our own midst now I want you to bring I want to bring you to this because this is an attack this is an attack from hell but I want you to realize that this attack is not on you this is tack on Jesus Christ this is an attack on the Ministry of Jesus Christ any man of God I mean men I mean true man God will tell you that his ministry is not of himself its of God brother rod brother long as we as we know has a very special gift and anointing that comes that can call out certain things a brother ray Erickson's church there I believe back in in October or November and I won't go into every single detail but there was a man there that was completely shadowed to death shadow to death sitting on this corner I pastor stuck snoop around stepped around on this side he said I don't know who that man is back there he said but I want that man first in this altar line in this prayer line here that man was diagnosed with cancer I believe a baby was diagnosed with these things and they were killing him and that shadow of death had to leave in the next morning he was standing out in the rain and said I have never felt so good in my life I feel like I drink a hundred cups of coffee is that right there was a man at brother Jason Jackson's that came to that was in his area that came to the meeting they're wearing them to meetings from brother Ron and brother Tim Pruitt were there and that man was told I by another church in that area that they did not believe in divine healing so there was another brother from brother Jason Church had told him that they believed in divine healing and they were having special meetings why don't you come this man had cancer in both lungs had cancer in his bones and they seen him and they prayed for him and the Lord ministered to him and all cancer is gone of cancer and his lungs is called of cancer and his bones is gone and he's went back to work another event just like that another event exactly like that happened it was called out cancer was called out cancer was challenged by God and cancer lost but now cancer notice what I'm saying to you I'm not just talking in the natural I'm talking in the in the spiritual realm that cancer is challenging the bride of Jesus Christ I'm talking about the crab cancer that is trying to destroy that cancer is trying to reach out and challenge the ministry of Jesus Christ this is not attack on brother on this is an attack on the Ministry of Jesus Christ now I want you to hear me loud and clear right now that this is a showdown between God and Satan and there is his a realm of impossibilities but this is where God works at his best this is where God fights at its with his word with his anointing this is an attack on the Ministry of Jesus Christ you've got to get it off of your mind and realize that the battle is not about you the battle is the Lord's the battle belongs through the Lord and the battle is the Lord's and the Lord will win the battle but you still got to show up you still got to show up you know we're gonna win you know we're gonna be victorious you know we're gonna overcome but somebody's got to show up to the batter God is going to win this through you [Applause] but the musicians come sister Stephanie I know you love this but this is a stupid devil we're dealing with stupid I mean you've got to be an ignoramus to do this I mean God already defeated Satan he's already defeated cancer he's already defeated all of these things but now Satan is stupid enough to challenge back a stone you got beat ever since the beginning of time do you really think you're going to win now it's easy for us are all these huh it's easy for us to get another natural health but in the spiritual realm if you could see what I'm saying to you Satan has challenged and Satan will lose Satan will loose I'm gonna give you

an arrow and shot it back into the spanish camp and it read surrender never we have our king with us why would we back up now why would we weigh the surrender flag now we've got a king with us surrender no way I'm King the Lord Jesus is in our camp he's a god that's mighty in battle he's never lost a battle he will not lose this war it will be Satan that waves a flag of surrender but as for
