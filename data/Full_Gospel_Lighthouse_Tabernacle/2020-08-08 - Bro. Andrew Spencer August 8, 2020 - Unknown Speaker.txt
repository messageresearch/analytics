thought i was working in town one afternoon attending some business affairs i heard a commotion a couple streets over and wondered what's happening there when a young man came running from that direction he stopped just to catch his breath i asked him to put it please tell me what was the matter he smiled at me and he said i was trying to catch the crippled man did he run past this way he was running home to tell everybody what jesus did today and the mute man was telling myself and the deaf girl he's leaving to answer god's call it's hard to believe but if you don't trust me you ask the blind man he saw it all asked the blind man he saw it all my friend if your troubles and burdens you carry are heavy and dragging you down and you've tried everything you can possibly think of but there's no relief to be found and that very same jesus that altered the future of the blind man the death and the lame he's still reaching out in this hour of trouble one touch and you'll never be the same i was trying to catch the crippled man did he run past this way he was rushing home to tell everybody what jesus did today and the mute man was telling myself and the deaf girl he's leaving to answer god's call [Music] if you don't trust me he asked the blind man he saw it all he asked the blind man he saw it all [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank you lock me up in a prism and throw away the keys take away the vision [Music] foreign me of the fear you can't even and my feet but as long as is [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] reach down his head and do this for me unworthy to live and not fear to kill [Music] [Music] and said i could still go free and [Music] [Applause] [Music] understand why a man [Applause] [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] trust [Music] [Applause] [Music] where the blood was [Music] so that i could still go [Music] that i could still go free tell me what kind of man would reach down [Music] [Applause] [Music] to live and not fear [Music] instead could still go free [Music] could still go free oh [Music] life is easy when you're upon the mountain [Music] [Applause] [Music] like you've never known [Music] but then things changing [Music] your [Music] faithful [Music] [Music] when things go wrong he'll make them right [Music] he's still gone in the bed of the day he's still god in the night [Music] we talk of faith [Music] but talk comes easy when life's at its best [Music] of trousers temptations that's where faith [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] we when things go wrong he'll make him right [Music] oh he's the man's house he's still gone in the night amen aren't you glad to be serving a god that is always the same amen it's good to be here in the house of lord this evening and and to greet you this way and uh to all those that are listening by the way the internet we greet you today in the name of the lord and uh happy to have each and every one of you here our hearts were a bit a bit saddened today when we got the news on sister sue comer but for sister sue's case death was a friend and when we get to that spot of life and you know i'm so thankful that there's a way to get out of these old pest houses and we may lose our mind and we may lose different things of aspects of life but it does not change that predestinated seed on the inside of us and and so we just want to be remembering the family there and the reason there's no funeral is it's just too hard during these times of covet that we're not able to have a funeral so a graveside is is what is suited for this time and so we just they still require us to do the social distancing and things and uh we've been a part of a few of these gravesides here in the last little bit and it seemed to go well and and we just pray that the lord will come and just meet us there and we just want to thank the lord for his protecting hand upon us this week we had quite a few storms come through our area i know the short boys were well they're not boys but the short brothers they were certainly blessed this week when and a lot of us were trees falling all around us either a microburst or tornado came through our area and the angel lord kept us and if you would see the the short brothers you'd see there the picture of their house when the tree fell you'll know that that god was with us and and so we just want to thank the lord for his keeping hand and uh all the things that he's kept us from and and away from this past week and we've made it through another week we're overcomers and we are here to show the devil whose side we're on i'm glad to be standing on the sides of jesus amen we want to congratulate brother jim and sister charlene uh for being grandparents again so we certainly want to uh congratulate them and brother joe and sister rexan and brother nate and sister caitlin i know that they're watching this evening so we greet them in the name of the lord and i'm so happy for them it was a year ago uh this week actually a year to the day that behind the curtain all of that transpired and just we just know that that was a miracle everything every little detail that was handled there that was that was handed out all of those things was a miracle of god and to happen a day a year to the day it shows me that the same god has got little charlie in his hands so we just want to thank the lord and we we certainly love brother nate and sister caitlin she's definitely his better half and i know he's listening but i say that to his face and behind his back too so so we certainly love them and appreciate them amen you love the lord tonight amen let's let's stand this evening we'll sing that song falling in love with jesus is the best thing i've ever done go down one maybe falling in love with jesus or falling in love with jesus falling in love with jesus was the best thing i ever ever taught [Applause] were falling in love with cheese who fall in love [Music] with my cheeks jesus were falling in love with jesus was the best thing i [Music] [Applause] [Music] i feel protected [Music] [Applause] [Music] his arms i feel protected oh there's no place i'd rather i'd rather be falling in love or falling in love with jesus for falling in love with jesus love with jesus was the best thing i ever ever done that's the best thing that i ever done in this life was falling in love with him amen if you have your bibles this evening we'll turn over in the book of isaiah chapter 59 and verse 15. certainly appreciated that song from brother greg certainly enjoy his gift and uh i know that he loves the lord and and uh i've always enjoyed that song if you don't trust me just ask the blind man amen isaiah chapter 59 and verse 15 yea truth faileth and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey and the lord saw it and it displeased him that there was no judgment and he saw that there was no man and wondered that there was no intercessor therefore his arm brought salvation unto him and his righteousness it sustained him for he put on righteousness as a breastplate and a helmet of salvation upon his head and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing and was clad with zeal as a cloak according to their deeds accordingly he will repay fury to his adversaries and recompense to his enemies to the islands he will repay recompense i mean he has a need that you'd like to take before the lord this evening amen god sees every one of your hands and your knees let's just lift them before the father just now father we approach your throne of mercy just now lord in a very humble way lord we approach your throne of mercy and grace lord knowing that it has been your protecting hand in the mighty hand of god that has been upon us this week and has brought us through another time that we could come to the house of god and enter into your courts with praise and offer thanksgiving unto the great i am now father we know that you're here lord we've gathered in your name and lord we we know that your angels of god have gathered to watch us as we worship tonight but lord we we've come here for more than just to be here out of the out of the ordinary or just to come here by tradition on a saturday night we we've come here to hear from you and father we're asking lord that you would begin to move in this congregation and go across these hearts lord that have lifted up a hand that has a need lord upon their life that they need you to move on father i pray that you would be ever so real to them tonight that that the spirit of reality would would begin to express himself to them and lord i pray that you would move from pew to pew and from house to house and may you begin to declare that you are still the same yesterday today and forever lord i pray that you would be high and lifted up in our midst tonight lord i pray that you would come and take these lips of clay and only say those things which would please thee tonight may the god of william branham stand up in jesus christ's name we pray these things amen god bless you you may be seated in the presence of the lord i'd like to i'd like to speak to you along the lines that we spoke last weekend i was we spoke to you last weekend or on on when god dresses for war and i'd like to speak to you by the help of the lord on the lamb declaring war and when we when we went through that last weekend we went through as god dressed himself for war and he and he put on the garments of vengeance and all of these things and and we see that that god dressed himself in the in the robe of humanity and he gave himself for you and i that that you and i could stand here in the liberty where christ has made us free and and what god has given to us in this hour is is not a weapon that is carnal he has not given us a he's not giving us of uh of a weak weapon but he gave us himself and the material that the church has got it is it's a mighty weapon and and there's never been one like it in all the world he because he gave us he gave us the best thing that he could have given us when he gave us his word and you see when he came he he came and he humbled himself down the the almighty god as he as he left the throne of glory and and he he left the splendor of heaven that the almighty god came to came to us in such a humiliating way that the men of the day missed it and still many people miss it even to this day he was born in a manger and he came and he came to use the weapon of love to love and that love conquered the world he didn't come he didn't come with an army with an army to bring bullets he didn't come with machine guns he didn't come with tanks he didn't come with all of the things of weaponries of men but he came with a weapon of love and he came in that way and he came in such a way that that men missed the very great i am as he came in that way and we we we see it so many times that even still today that that many overlook this great weapon of love it's amazing what love can do that love conquers all things that love is is such a very powerful force that that love will make you do extreme things you you see what the love of god did it made him leave the throne of mercy it made him leave heaven as we would say to make him and make himself a body that he would be bruised in that he would be scarred in so that he could feel like you feel and understand like you understand because he wanted to understand the things that you're going through but so many people were looking for for a great general and looking for for a great man with a with a genius mind to come and set everything in order but we look and what did god send to us he sent us a lamb he sent us a lamb and we look over in matthew 3 when we see the spirit of god descending upon him when the dove descends upon the lamb and it shows us that the lead that the dove is leading the lamb and it has to be the same way in the church today that if the dove does not lead you if you are not impelled by that leadership of the holy spirit you will be led off into some odd thing or let off into some carnal thing or let off in the things of the world but the dove of the holy spirit will not lead you into things of man or not lead you into things of carnality and you may sin and you may you may do something and you may offend god but brother branham would tell us he would tell us that when you sin that dove don't go very far away he said that dove would go up and maybe sit on a branch right there and when you repent of your sins that that dove of the holy spirit will come right back down and land upon your shoulder so we realize that when you go to confess in your sins that the dove of the spirit begins to move to you and gums begins to coo towards you we look over in revelations chapter 5 and when you see john as he was weeping there at john being a type of the bride of jesus christ and and you you were seen you were seen weeping there if you can put yourself there because if you would look at it and you look at all the sin and all the sin of humanity that was stacked up there and you and you saw your name on that book and you looked there on that book and then there was not one found worthy throughout heaven and throughout the earth it would make you weep it would make you feel a sorrow on the inside of your on the inside of your soul it would leave such a pit of despair on the inside of you that it would leave you troubled but as john was weeping there was an elder that stood up and said weep not john for the lion of the tribe of judah hath prevailed hallelujah here was the worthy one and when john turned around to see he turned around to see a lion but when he turned he didn't see a lion but he's seen a lamb oh there's many a times when the line of the word comes out and he calls out your sin and calls out who you are and calls out the wrongs of your life but when you go to turn to him you don't see a line but you see the lamb of god it's the mercies of god that has renewed your strength it is the joy of the lord that has made you strong and it is the lamb's mercy to you that has placed you in a position to receive the word of the hour hallelujah but when john turned to see that lamb that lamb was seen as a bloody lamb that lamb had been in battle that lamb had been wounded in battle and he was bloody all over because he'd been in battle and what was he in battle for you he was in battle for me but i want you to know that when john looked to see that lamb that lamb was not dead but that lamb was living hallelujah he's ever living he's not changing he's still remaining and the lamb of god is still setting on the throne tonight there's still blood on the mercy seat i know a lot of people want to take the blood off the mercy seat but if you take the blood off the mercy seat you're as guilty as guilty can be oh hallelujah but there is a blood that washes away all of your sins that lamb when he went to fight for you he didn't leave anything undone he went all the way he don't have to pay for your sins no more he don't have to be beat no more and i want to tell you church you ain't got to beat yourself hallelujah you ain't going to put yourself through purgatory and repla try to pay for all the generational sins that's been passed down throughout your genealogies that's already been stripped off that's already been taken care of because the lamb was declaring war against sin who but he wasn't just declaring war on sin he was declaring war on your freedom because everything that was holding you bound when the devil tried to put his dirty hands upon your life the owner took the book oh hallelujah when adam fell satan tried to put his dirty hands upon your life but what happened the owner stood up and said that's mine he's got a he's got a now satan's got a claim he's got a claim on this earth he's got a claim on the kingdoms of this earth and as you all you see what satan tried to do he tried to give this kingdom he tried to give all the kingdoms to jesus but jesus was not willing just to take it jesus said no sir i'm going to buy this oh hallelujah you know something when somebody gives you something when somebody gives you something sometimes you don't appreciate it but when you buy something when you put your money in the product whoo help me preach when you put your money in the product that you want it means something to you and jesus is saying that you mean something to him you see satan was wanting to give jesus a kingdom without a calvary oh hallelujah that's the same thing that satan wants to do to you today he wants to give you he wants to give you the holy ghost without you going through calvary that's what the world out here wants to offer you is some holy religion that'll make you live right when you're in church but it won't make you live right when you're outside a church oh no i'm gonna purchase that that means something to me and i want you to know he's still fighting for you look at your neighbor say he's still fighting for me you see when the lamb stood up he was saying that i am strong enough i have done the kinsmen work there ain't nobody else in heaven and there ain't nobody else in earth there's no angels there's no principalities there's not anybody on earth or in heaven that is strong enough to do this but the lamb is saying i'm worthy enough i'm good enough i'm strong enough he was saying brother standing i'm worthy enough for your cause i'm worthy enough for your cause brother nathaniel i'm worthy enough for ron's picture i'm worthy enough to take everything that was laid upon you i'm worthy enough to take this satan ain't going to like this one now the bible says in first corinthians 14 and 8 that if the trumpet give an uncertain sound who shall prepare himself to battle you see if the trumpet is giving out an unscriptural sound in the day no man can prepare himself for laodicean h but you know that when you look at the trumpet that came and you look it was not an uncertain sound when it was sounding through the voice of jesus it was certain you could be certain of those things you could be certain of what he said lazarus was certain of it he knew that there was nothing uncertain of it when he was down there in in the grave and down there spinning around in a world that we don't know exactly where he was at but he was down there fellowshipping with the saints of old but all of a sudden there came a voice from another world that said lazarus come forth now there may have been men that was praying for laughter say praying for his family but last was not but when this one stood up it was more than him just praying for it but there was a voice from another world that said i'm calling you out of this world back into this world there has been a voice that has screamed out in this hour that is calling you out of laodicea and pulling you up in the heavenly places in you what you choose or what god has chosen to be in well this trumpet that we've heard in this day it's a scriptural sound and there ain't nothing uncertain about the sound that we've heard this trumpet voice has sounded and the bride of jesus christ has prepared herself the bride will go through wars she will go through she will go through temptations she will go through trials but she will not falter she will not buckle under the pressure because there has been a sounding go forth that has declared to her the word of this hour and she's prepared herself for battle now jesus told her for otis told us over in matthew 24 in six he said you shall hear of wars and rumors of wars he said see that you be not troubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet now brother branham preached this up in the first seal and he says he said wars and rumors of wars he said but trumpet denotes political disturbances whereas seals deals with a religious disturbance you see and a seal is open and a message is dropped and the church is always so set up in its own political ways and whatever more and of his dignitary and when that when that real message drops that messenger goes forth and he shakes them to pieces he said that's right it's a religious disturbance when a seal is open that's what's happened you watch when every time a trumpet is sounded that when the messenger of the day goes forth that that trumpet is denoting war and when paul the first messenger went forth he was declaring war on the on the orthodox church and when you see wesley going forth he was declaring war on the message of the day of yesterday when they were saying that there was no more work of the holy ghost that he was declaring war that there was a second work of grace that there was a sanctification that was that was coming it was a second work of god's grace and you can relate to this maybe even a little bit more that when the seventh messenger when it came in this hour he was declaring war on the laodicean age and he blasted against that layout of sea and age there was nothing uncertain about this scriptural sound but he was not to bring forth and he was not had a certain mystery that he was to declare but what he did that seventh angel gathered up all all of those mysteries that's been lost in them ages he was to finish all the mysteries of god again in the sixth seal he said trumpets always denote war and the messenger the angel came on the earth and the messenger of the hour like luther's like any of the messengers that we've talked of what did he do what does he do he arrives and a seal open reveals a trumpet sound and a war is declared and away they go and then the messenger dies he seals away this group they're put in and a plague falls upon those who rejected it and then it goes on and they organize and get another organization now notice then here they come out with another power see another power of another age uh another age of the church another ministry and then when he does that along comes god with his ministry when the antichrist comes with his the anti is against they run side by side now he said i want you to notice a little something just about the time that cain came on the earth abel came on the earth i want you to notice just about the time that christ came on the earth judas came on the earth about the time that christ came that christ went off the earth judas went off the earth and just about the time that the holy spirit fell the antichrist spirit fell and just about the time the holy ghost is revealing himself here in the last days the antichrist is showing his colors coming through these politics and things and just about the time the antichrist moves himself fully on the scene god moves himself fully to redeem his own when the antichrist is coming on the scene god is moving himself to redeem his own you see wherever the word of god is the enemy is close by are you with me i want you to know that the enemy's real close by tonight you see he ain't got a clue he ain't got a clue until it gets released until the trumpet sounds he ain't got a clue about it he's not omnipresent neither is he omniscient but when that seal is released when that trumpet goes forth then he goes and he tries to pervert those saints oh hallelujah you watch as christ comes down you have yourself a jubilee tonight and you'll go out and you'll fight against the antichrist tomorrow you'll feel on top of the world tonight and you'll feel down in a valley tomorrow but does that change the word does it change your predestination does it change the move of god it just shows you that the spirit of christ is here and the spirit of the antichrist is warned against the the move of god this even moses moses was that close and pharaoh missed it now the devil's slick but he's dumb because moses was raised right under the nose of pharaoh and he's had his hand he's had his hand upon a lot of you young people and he's tried to keep you but what he don't realize is that there is a predestinated seed that's laying there that he can't stop you've been risen in this hour right under the nose of the devil what he thought he was doing to you is just bringing about a greater victory hallelujah you see moses had to come forth to produce the word of the hour you see moses was predestinated to be there but there was a seed that had to come forth and when moses was was brought up on the scene you watch as soon as that ministry of moses go forth you watch that antichrist move begin to attach itself and try to war against the move of god you remember when moses as soon as he goes into pharaoh's courts that moses throws down his rod and he becomes a snake but you watch as those magicians and those philosophers they put down their sticks and they tried to contest against the god of moses now this is amazing to me there's not one time in the old testament when the names of these philosophers has ever spoken when the name of these magicians it's never spoken but when you go over in a second timothy chapter 3 you find out the name of those philosophers the name of those magicians and the paul tells us that we're just like janice and jamery's withstood moses these in this hour resisted the truth of god oh my goodness i i just if you knew where i was going just now you'd go ahead and come up on this pulpit and help me preach you see all throughout the old testament the enemy thought that he'd got by without the lord calling out their names but when he got over in the new testament when all the mysteries was being revealed god did not forget the names of the demons that withstood moses and resisted the truth hallelujah god does not forget the enemy that has contested you and god will not forget the spirit of hell that has attacked you that has attacked this bride god will not forget cancer god will not forget criticism god will not forget depression god will not forget complexes god will not forget suicide god will not forget it but there is a lamb that is declaring war on the devil hallelujah you see about the time the antichrist moves his cell phone then god moves himself in to redeem his own hallelujah now notice over in revelations chapter 17 i'm going to need some more up here brothers don't let me blast them but let me let me have a little bit more i got some meat to throw at you the bible says here in revelation 17 at 14 and we look that we can look back and we could see throughout this scripture throughout revelations chapter 17 we look and we see the mother of harlots we see that great that sets herself upon the seven hills and brother branham said that you'd have to be death blind and dumb not to know who that is and you look at those kings that were there that the ones that gave power over to the beast and brother bannon said that those were those were dictators in that hour and notice what verse 14 says that these these kings shall make war with the lamb and the lamb shall overcome them for he is lord of lords and king of kings and they that are with him are called and chosen and faithful that'll make you want us out hallelujah those that are with him are cold they're chosen they're faithful he's not saying the is with him the kings aren't with him rome isn't with him the church world isn't with him politics ain't with him but they that are with the lamb are called are chosen are faithful hallelujah all things work together for the good to them that love god who are thee called hallelujah didn't paul say that you're called not only are you called you're justified not only you're justified you're glorified the lamb is standing up for the cold [Applause] oh i love that i'm with him i'm with the lamb and if i'm with the lamb brother william it tells me i'm cold if i'm with the lamb it tells me i'm chosen if i'm with the lamb if i'm with the lamb i'm faithful sure you got ward on that this week sure you battled on that this week did that change god's mind about his word concerning you yes yes the enemy is going to face you when i watch the spirit of hell stand beside a brother this past weekend when he stood there and tried to block the visitation i watched the angel the lord get through i didn't tell nobody else about it but i watched i watched a shadow hang over an individual and i watched that shadow get broke last weekend you see that enemy would like to stand over you and he tries to block you and hold you down with the dead of your past but there's a lamb there's a lamb that's declaring war on that spirit of hell on that spirit of shadow of doubt that's trying to that that's trying to cause the people to disbelieve this truth not only is he trying to get them to disbelieve this truth he's trying to get them to disbelieve me oh you see if he can get you to disbelieve me i can't help you but there's a lamb that's declaring war on that on that spirit that comes out of hell whoo i don't have to fight this he's fighting my paddles you don't know what it's like to stand here behind the pulpit and actually see that demon of hell as he's beginning to chase down somebody you don't know what it does to me when i stand there and i watch that shadow lead some people off but what it is to watch that shadow get completely demolished when the word keeps piling word on top of a word building cell on top of sale those are the things that are to be hallelujah what a destiny that we've called to we were seen before the foundation of the world now in the invisible union of the bride of christ the prophet said we all know that the modern church in its present condition and its present state is in no condition to finish up the great commission that god gave the church for this day we know that the church could not the pentecostal church by no means by no means could carry out the last day message in this present condition and he goes on and he says it's going to be an elected people that's elected for it the church world can't carry this message the girlfriends can't carry this message but you can he will be an elected people that carry this message and here you stand here you stand with an open book in your hand with a clear deed a clear title deed to redemption what can stand against the bride of jesus christ i say no weapon that is formed against us shall prosper if god is for you who can be against you you're standing in this hour you're not sitting down you're not complacent you're standing in this hour with an open book in your hand this book isn't closed this book ain't closed all the loose ends have been tied up all those denominational barriers that held the word of god bound all the isms of man that were against the word and you has been struck off the lamb the lamb did not step forth just to open those seals so that you could be another church group so that you could have the title a message of the hour tacked on you he came to reveal the unwritten word and to give you a rapturing faith oh taste and see that the lord is good you see if you ever taste of this seven course menu you'll never look back to what the world has to offer let me say this to you if you ever taste of this seven course menu you'll never taste of those things but you'll never be satisfied with just one service or just one tape but you'll always hunger for more you'll say every redemptive blessing is for me hello you're not just standing here with an ax2 experience you're standing here under the anointing of the mighty angel in this day yes you've got the holy ghost yes you've had an experience yes you had all those things but do you realize where you're standing at you're standing under the anointing of the mighty angel you're not probing into it you're not presuming into it you know what you got in your hand and you know what to do with it take the inheritance the bible said in deuteronomy 30 and 14 that the word of god is now thee even in my mouth and in my heart that thou mayest do it is that right there ain't going to be nothing there will be nothing that stops your mouth you watch satan on the move today he's tried to stop your mouth he's tried to mask your mouth he's tried to stop you from speaking he's tried to stop you from echoing out these testimonies satan is doing his worst but he cannot stop her mouth now notice the bible says in revelations 19 and 5 and a voice came out of the throne saying praise our god all ye his servants and you that fear him both small and great and i heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many waters and the voice of a mighty thunder and saying hallelujah for the lord god omnipotent reigneth hallelujah that voice of many waters that is the voice of the fifo ministry it is the voice of the bride's ministry that is designed to shake the devil you see that's why he's trying to stop you he's trying to stop the voice that will shake the devil you see god is speaking to the church and reflecting himself through seven spirits and when the true anointed of god speaks it's the voice of god to reject it is to remove the candlestick you see voices the voices of the seven church ages the voice is speaking with thunder and lightning nowadays we don't believe in saying hell in the pulpit no mercy we need men of god men who won't hold back never now everybody can't be a preacher but if you got a voice if you're a preacher you're called to the pulpit to preach if you're not you're still a preacher but live the people a sermon let your sermon be lived and if it's the voice of god that'll bring reproach to them who reject it you see they say no one can put a finger on his or her life they're sweet living if there ever was a man of god it's that man or that woman see live your sermon i know it's hard i know it's real hard for the make-believer but for a real believer live your sermon don't try to preach them if you're not called to preach get all mixed up anyhow and messed up and you'll get people all tangled up you don't you won't know what you'll ruin them and yourself too just live your sermon the preacher's called to preach his and the leo live it too and if you can't live it then stop preaching but you're supposed to live your sermons oh how we need in jeffersonville thousands of live voices the thunder of god thundering out and sweetness and holiness and purity undefiled lives walking around in the earth today without a blemish yes sir real christians real christians that's the thunder against the enemy but i thought it was my boastful speaking on facebook i thought it was me being proud about my salvation and condemning people when i see them doing wrong that ain't the thunder that scares the enemy it's that real sweet holy purity that lived i'm gonna get up inside your address i'm gonna get in your closet and i'm gonna call out all them skeletons you got living in there and you can try to put on your two-faced three-face face all you want to but if it ain't a live voice it will not thunder against the enemy oh but if you are on the inside and there's something more than you just living on the inside of that house if there is a real holy ghost move on the inside that's the thunder against the enemy oh come on somebody i got young people say oh if i could just have one of those yak meetings one more time again i know that i'd really get it no you wouldn't if you are counting on one of my youth meetings you should be here tonight that's who i'm preaching to the youth i believe that we're going to the greatest youth camp that's ever been i can live right i can live right as long as i'm around the pastor no you can't and you don't think i see through that now we put brother gabriel inside our house cause he's our family we wouldn't let anybody just do that but do you really think that it was ron spencer connie spencer andrew spencer that made gabriel get it he's not here because he's identified as a spencer name sure that's who we're going to preach to we're going to preach to our family who else do you talk to right people get mad because because message churches are family churches well in the world would you rather get saved than your family that's the one you preach to that's the one you live this to but gabriel didn't get it just because he was living in the house of ron spencer now it had a great big influence but the reason why there is a thunder against the enemy living there it's because it's a live voice [Music] where where's my yak attack at let me preach right here reason why satan hates the yak attack and those of you that do not understand yak it's the young adult choir now you understand that when we get up here it's more than just another choir but it's a yak that is attacking against the devil that's trying to destroy you can come to my house you can sit down i can take you through the seals i can take you through the church ages i can take you through all the quotes as all if that's all you get it's still not a thunder against the enemy but that real lived voice i got now i'm a preacher i got people that tell me they tell me that they're doing this and they're doing that and and they're they're pointing others to christ but their life is pointing in a different direction so you're trying to talk a good game but you're not walking a good game are you with me and you see you can shout you can dance you can holler you can scream you can get so in the spirit of the atmosphere in a church and you'll leave here and say man i had chills running up and down my back i know i got it you better watch him chills next time you walk in the freezer department you might get a chill are you with me it's got to be more than a chill running down your back it's got to be a baptism of the holy ghost i have watched some of the best potential to get it and they didn't get it i'm not talking about people here i'm talking about people in general when you watch people that were that close when you look at that judas spirit that still lives today but when it comes to pentecost they show their colors what is it it's death now i'm planning to say this but it was brought to my attention this week so it shows it shows that i'm right on tune you see there's a lot of people that want their boogie woogie oh i can just every time i hear it i like that old-time stuff you know they say it sues it let me tell you you can listen your country music you can listen your rock and roll you say oh i just love hearing that oh i don't listen to the bad stuff i listen to the good stuff let me say this to you if it came from the pit of hell it came from the pit of hell you can listen oh i listened to that old country back when things were good you know you know what i'm saying this back when old hank was the tank you know that's what i'm talking about that's my style you see that was good stuff not like this stuff they got today you better be careful you're going to boogie your woogie your way right on into hell while we're marching our way into heaven get mad at me all you want to but i want to see you there i've told people this i've told people this that people that battle devil spirits evil spirits you trace it back every time a person fights suicide you trace it back and you watch what they're listening to i don't plan to say this for the person i don't spoke to this week god laid it on my heart two weeks ago to say these things so i'm not just saying it because it was brought to my attention but it showed me that it need to be dealt with it shows what world you're going and pointing to but i do believe this i'll tell you to get rid of that rock and roll i'll tell you get rid of that rap music i'll tell you get rid of that tommy rod i'll tell you those things but i'm also going to tell you to replace those things if you take it out put something better back in you take out rap put in a good old gospel song something that'll not just bring in devil spirits but something that'll drive them out well i got halfway through that quote and we got y'all there so let's see where the rest of the quote takes us and notice he said that's a thunder against the enemy the devil don't care how loud you can holler the devil don't care how much you can jump how much you can do this or shout but what hurts the devil is to see that sanctified holy consecrated god to god say anything to him call anything just as sweet as it can be and move right on oh my that throws him away that's the thunder that shakes the devil hallelujah you see it's your live voice that shakes the devil this is a living message that will defeat satan any time anyplace anywhere now let me get down here in this warfare just for a moment brother braham said i had a great admiration for general eisenhower he said when we're fighting he said when we were fighting he said there's many times we picked up a shell and thrown it into the gun and pulled the hammer and let her fall and it snapped it didn't go off it said we didn't surrender we might have put another one in and it snapped through we didn't give up said we kept on snapping till the one went off he said that's the way to win the war keep trying throw the shell in and pull it you got a purpose and a target to hit and if it don't go off throw it out and throw another one in try again throw it in try it again until one goes off there's one of them there that's alive and one of them will go off but that's the way we got to do is just keep firing away firing away until something happens that's the way a children of god does they stand there and when they stand in front of the face of the enemy they keep grabbing the promises and they keep chucking the shell in and said well maybe that one didn't work but this one will maybe that one didn't work but this one will you don't give up you don't surrender general patton said accept challenges so that you may feel the exhilaration of victory accept those challenges hallelujah when winston churchill was in the midst of world war ii and they had all the politicians of europe in a war bunker he made this this very prolific speech he said even though tracts of europe and many old famous states have fallen or may fall into the grip of the gestapo and all the odious apparatuses of nazi rule we shall not flag or fail we shall go on to the end we shall fight in france we shall fight on the seas and oceans we shall fight with a growing confidence and a growing strength in the air we shall offend our island whatever the cost may be we shall fight on the beaches we shall fight on the landing grounds we shall fight in the fields and in the streets we shall fight in the hills and we shall never surrender never give in never never never never in nothing greater small larger petty never give in that was a man that was in a war bunker that was enthused about his country fighting a war but let me say and let me prophesy to you church of the living god we will win this war we will never back down we will never surrender we will win this war hallelujah we may fight in the streets we might fight in our homes we may fight in church but we will never surrender hallelujah possessing the gate of the enemy you don't have to conquer it he conquered it the other men had to conquer their own gate but you don't have to conquer it it's already conquered he conquered the gate of sickness and what did he do when he conquered the gate of sickness saying that he would whatever you ask on earth and whatever you bound on earth he would bind it in heaven and give us the keys to the gate he conquered the gate of temptation by the word and the key was resist the enemy and he will flee from you he conquered it all he conquered every sickness he conquered death he conquered hell he conquered death and hell he conquered what the others couldn't conquer because they are of the natural seed this is the spiritual seed he conquered the gate of the grave and rose up on the third day for our justification and now we are more than conquerors we just walk right into it as an inheritance we're more than conquerors now we are dealing with a defeated enemy sickness is defeated death is defeated hell is defeated everything is defeated oh my i wish i was twice my size now maybe i feel twice as good we are disputing with a conquered enemy when he tells he's going to kill you he's already been conquered [Applause] you know when you've been warned with him this week you know he ain't nothing but a bluff he ain't got no arrows for his own bow he ain't got no strength all of his power was was stripped by jesus christ at calvary so when he's telling you you can't overcome you remember you're disputing with a conquered enemy you see if satan can make you believe that your weapon is inadequate he's got you disarmed i had i had a man coming to my house from the county this week is coming up there and check out some final things on my garage i'm building for these young people so that these young people can have a place where they can worship god and they can feel safe and secure yes i did that for your children and if you ever ask if i'm not committed to your children you've got to be an idiot i wouldn't do that for myself but i did it for your children i had this county man coming brother jim seen him when he was coming up the driveway i told him i was looking for mr happy i'm pretty sure those county mounties they wake up mad they're just looking for somebody to cuss forgive me if you work at the county i've only dealt with a certain few but after after everything was okay he passed everything praise the lord he come in he said you know he said when i first got up here well john we got all kinds of signs you'd have to be blind to not see our no trespassing signs but we got this one sign it said that if you can read this sign you're in range and he said you know he said i didn't know what i was getting myself into when i was coming back up here you really didn't but he said you know he said i didn't really know he said whether your people is going to pull a gun on me i said we don't put them signs there for you good people we put them there for them idiots that want to come up through here and just squat on our land see you know most of the time it does scare the good people but it don't scare the people that i want to scare it off of he's well i didn't really know what i was getting myself into coming up here i said ah i said i wouldn't really pull a gun on you but my dogs when they got out the car you'd have thought they was going to eat his pants off you see the difference was i knew they wouldn't but he didn't the truth of it is they probably lick you to death before they chew on you but you know that sign will scare the good people but it won't scare the bad people but i was thinking about that after he told me it's about time that you hang a sign up on your soul that you get a good look at satan and you say hey look at here buddy you take a look at this sign if you can see this token you're in range the lamb has got his he's got his sights set on you and if you get within so many feet of this token you're well you're liable to get blown back it's a time that the children of god ought to hang up a sign they say hey they know trespassing around here this is god's property it'll stay i'll tell you that you put a sign up like that i ain't found a good devil yet but it'll scare the good devils he'll scare the mediocre devils and he'll scare the bad devils when you put that token upon your life you know when the devil takes a look at sister joyce and sister evelyn you know the devil takes off running while there's a sign up there's a sign up hanging on that door you're in range you stupid devil come closer come closer there's a double barrel shotgun of the old and new testament word that's got its sights set on you just get a little bit closer and we'll pull the trigger i'd like to see that sister evelyn boom now i know brother donny do it you probably ain't gotta cross him real good and he shoots you hallelujah oh my they'll kick me out of the message for sure now now take the word of god and cut your way through every doubt see sure i'm back on the prophet's word now so you ain't got to hold no gun against me you say me take the word of god and cut your way through every doubt sir that's the next job let's get it done that's the next thing i'm to do next thing i'm to do is get away from my doubts and cut it down that's my next job is to get away from my frustrations if my senses tell me what you feel bad the next thing to do is to cut that thing away that's right well you say well you tell me you know my should tell me brother brown well you might as well cut that

take that word and pull with the sword and if you got a whack if you whacked it the first time and it don't seem to move whack it again whack it again whack it again and whack it until you chipped a hole through like a little chicken piping itself out or an eagle what you are he said pip yourself right on through that old shell of sickness cut your way and say hallelujah where's the next one where's the next one that's the battle that's a soldier that's the soldier of the call of the cross yes sir knock every enemy out why why we are a predestinated royal seat of abraham and when abraham denied everything that was against god's word he chopped his way right through every obstacle that came in front of him they said your wife is too old he just chopped one thing out of the way the devil said you can't do this you can't do that and abraham chopped it out of the way he whacked at it and whacked at it until he cut himself through where's next lord move your tent up here he went up there and built an altar a player got a prayer and satan said you now said now i tell you this is not the right place i'll stay right here get off my grounds he said hallelujah and lot said you better come on down here we're having a good time down here we've got all our organization down here while my wife is the head of the military society and and everything else in the city i tell you you ought to come down here sarah said abraham he said shut up sarah hallelujah stand right here you better not do that this is where god's placed me bill be after you do that he said this is where god's placed me right right here is where i stand and here is where god's placed me brother nate and sister caitlin's been told all kinds of things this week but they kept whacking at it they kept cutting their way through you've been told a lot of things but you kept whacking at it you kept cutting at it and you kept screaming hallelujah where's the next one cancer came and we just kept whacking at it brain bleach came and we just kept whacking at it sarcoidosis came and we kept whacking at it depression came and we kept whacking at it the lamb has declared war on your enemy that enemy wants your health he wants your joy but the lamb is declaring that the land of the holy ghost is yours the lamb is declaring that the land of healing is yours he's declaring that the land of miracles is yours he's declaring that the land of signs and wonders is yours he's declaring that a right mind is yours he is declaring that all these redemptive blessings that flowed down from calvary is yours and you hold the title deed of redemption and you say you're able to say it's all mine is that right i can tell you it's yours i can tell you i can preach to you and tell you that it's yours but until you accept it as yours the lamb standing for you and the lamb is against every enemy that raises his head against you we've heard the trumpet sound so we know we're in a warfare but our weapons are not carnal but mighty and strong and pulling down the strongholds of satan you remember you remember when the old testament and i'm finished but i'm finishing with this thought that when a man was sold into slavery and he had a debt over his head he'd been sold into slavery that he had to work for thou being her work for that man until the year a jubilee came you see that that that man had been sold into slavery and he was waiting for the year of jubilee to come and there was a year there was a year that came and every seven years it would sound but only on the 50th year was the jubilee trumpet sounded and that man that had been sold into slavery he was waiting for the sounding of that trumpet now some of you don't want to some of you don't want to hear this trumpet but there's somebody that's waiting on it and it won't offend me it won't offend me it'll make me lose sleep but it won't offend me if you turn down this trumpet but when that trumpet sound that man that had worked there all those years he'd worked side by side with servants and those servants was there and they was getting their wages for it they was getting their wages for working in that field but this man because of the debt that was hanging over him he was working in that field and when he was working in that field he was staying there he was staying there until that jubilee trumpet sounded he was waiting on the trumpet of victory to sound he was waiting on the trumpet of freedom to sound now look at we look at me real quick was that psalms 137 it says by the rivers of babylon there we sat down yea we wept when we remembered zion we hang our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof for there they carried us away captive and required of us a song that they wasted us they wasted us and required of a smurf saying sing us one of the songs a zion how shall we sing the lord's song in a strange land how can you sing the song thank god i'm free when you're still bound how can you sing the song jesus set me free when you're still enslaved by the taskmaster of sin when you see people today that's out there standing in the streets and they're crying for freedom they're crying for they're crying for moral freedom they're crying from freedom from police brutality they're crying from they're crying for their own freedoms and they don't even know what they want but they don't even realize that they are so enslaved by sin that he's got their reigns he's got the reigns on them and all he's got to do is talk them into one cigarette and they'll do the rest all he's got to do is talk him into mixing drinks one time and they'll do the rest all he's got to do is talk him into doubting the word one time and they'll do the rest so how can you sing the song of freedom when you're in a strange land you can't do it but you're not singing a song in a strange land you're singing a song of freedom in the land of the holy ghost oh hallelujah those that were standing side beside those servants and those that were born that were born israelite it didn't affect it didn't affect the servant when the jubilee trumpet sounded but when it sounded over the real true seed you see i watch it when i begin to watch as the priest begins to sound out that trumpet and i watch how's it how that that trumpet begins to sound and i watch as that warfare takes place i can watch when it affects a servant it'll roll right off of them but when you watch that sound of freedom hit a son they'll start running in their spirit they'll start shouting in their spirit they'll begin to pull on the word of god they'll begin to rejoice they'll throw down their hole they'll throw down and they'll start running back to everything that they had been robbed from they run back to that inheritance because there was a priest that grabbed a hold of the ram's horn hallelujah it was the sounding of the trumpet that made the real seed return we are not of the pond woman but of the free so paul told us to stand stand there for your liberty where christ has made you free and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage and jesus said that when the truth when you hear the truth the truth shall make you free and whom the son has set free is free indeed it was the sound of a trumpet that screamed out a message of grace but if you refuse to hear that trumpet and go back to your rightful inheritance you're marked in the ear and you're never to be free again brother barum said as the musicians come that every age every generation has a fresh chance at the word you know god is obligated to give every person an opportunity to hear this word but for him to give you a second chance a third chance a fourth chance a fifth chance a sixth chance it's the sound of grace hallelujah hallelujah i say let freedom ring let's stand tonight oh father in heaven how gracious and pure are thy words full of grace and truth father that would set the captives free [Music] i remember when the grace of god was sounded forth my way oh hallelujah i look upon your children tonight and i see the grace of god that has called them out of the bondage of the slave master that they no longer have to stay there in that bound condition [Music] but it was the redeeming sound of the realm's horn that declared freedom over the real seed lord i pray one more time would you sound out that trumpet and may your seed come running no matter how many times they've been beat no matter how many times they've been told they can't go [Music] that they can go and they can walk out right now father it's your grace towards your children [Music] you've declared war [Music] and the enemy has tried to stop and tried to hinder and trying to affect and trying to cause interference but i believe there's an angel that's standing ever so close to wake him up i pray one more time father may they hear that trumpet sin may your grace be bestowed upon your children just now in jesus name amen amen do you love the lord tonight his grace [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] i was [Music] [Applause] [Music] grace [Music] i fears [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] shall we [Music] is [Music] don't wanna wear [Music] [Applause] i'm gonna wear [Music] we shall [Music] amen are you bound for that promised land let's sing that as we're preparing to dismiss this evening on joy one jordan stormy banks i stand and cast no wish [Music] help me out for the [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] [Applause] for the promised land [Music] hey man we'll change that to see the bright light shine it's just about home time i'm glad of that too there's a light in the window table spread splendor for someone standing by the open door oh well i can't see the crystal river i must be here forever lord i've never been this whole sick before or see the bright lights shine well it's just about all the time [Music] [Music] people anymore [Music] oh this the lonesome heart is crying i think i'll spread my wings from life lord i've

people oh there's a light in the window or table
