[0:04] [Music]
[0:34] it's strange how god does things
[0:37] he'll let us get right down to the last
[0:41] the last mile away
[0:46] you know he he likes to do that
[0:49] he did it with the hebrew children
[0:52] he knew who he could trust
[0:54] so he let that
[0:57] then boys walk right up to the fiery
[0:59] furnace so they could almost smell the
[1:02] fire
[1:04] and he never moved
[1:06] but when it comes time he'll move
[1:11] you move but he waits till his own time
[1:15] do you want to see what kind of a
[1:16] reaction they had
[1:18] he knew they had made their stance
[1:21] and when he knows that you make your
[1:23] stand
[1:26] he'll let satan take you to the last
[1:29] mile away
[1:31] just remember he's still there
[1:33] [Music]
[1:35] he wants to see if you really mean what
[1:37] you're talking about
[1:39] well i believe god's the healer yes i
[1:40] sure believe it and the next day you
[1:42] still got your pain
[1:45] well maybe i never got it
[1:48] sure you got it
[1:50] just want to see how you're going to
[1:51] react or what you say
[1:55] you say all praise god i believe in the
[1:57] baptism of the holy spirit
[2:00] the first little temptation comes along
[2:01] and plows like a birth cell
[2:05] trying to see your reaction on your
[2:07] actions
[2:10] he's trying to test you
[2:12] every son that cometh to god must first
[2:15] be chasing
[2:17] tested
[2:19] every child
[2:20] that comes to him he puts him through a
[2:22] test to see how he'll act

[1:00:05] we know him as an on-time god
[1:00:08] amen
[1:00:09] well if you haven't felt him here
[1:00:11] already you're numb
[1:00:16] certainly good to be in the house of the
[1:00:18] lord isn't it
[1:00:19] our expectations are so high for the
[1:00:21] weekend it's
[1:00:23] i just don't know how to explain it
[1:00:25] quite quite right or to do it quite
[1:00:27] right but
[1:00:28] we're so under expectation for what god
[1:00:32] we have prayed about these meetings and
[1:00:34] they have
[1:00:35] come to fruition
[1:00:37] last year this time we were in a very
[1:00:39] different place
[1:00:41] and for those that don't know
[1:00:44] one year ago we had just been diagnosed
[1:00:46] with lung cancer
[1:00:48] and
[1:00:49] and we knew that we were in a fight
[1:00:52] we were at stage four at that point and
[1:00:55] we were just beginning chemo treatments
[1:00:58] and uh at that time it was infusion
[1:01:01] i'm now on chemo every day about 20
[1:01:04] pills a day at home
[1:01:06] but
[1:01:08] but at that time we were just
[1:01:09] discovering kind of where everything was
[1:01:11] at
[1:01:13] brother wayne comes and he preaches two
[1:01:15] dynamic services
[1:01:17] but on friday before the meeting i went
[1:01:20] blind to my left side
[1:01:22] and so still that way if i don't see you
[1:01:24] on the left side just
[1:01:26] just as i'm not seeing you so
[1:01:28] but anyway
[1:01:30] you know sometimes i have people say
[1:01:32] well
[1:01:33] i
[1:01:34] aren't you really concerned that that
[1:01:36] comes back
[1:01:37] i read in the scripture where a man
[1:01:39] wrestled with an angel of the lord
[1:01:42] and
[1:01:43] and there was a
[1:01:45] place in the hollow of his thigh that he
[1:01:47] always limped from
[1:01:49] from that point forward
[1:01:51] to remember that he had been visited by
[1:01:53] an angel
[1:01:55] and and so whenever i think about the
[1:01:58] blindness in my eyes and it's in both
[1:02:00] eyes i think about that god spared my
[1:02:03] life
[1:02:06] brother wayne has probably no doubt
[1:02:08] preached to meetings all over the world
[1:02:11] and they can say that there was
[1:02:12] incredible miracles that took place
[1:02:15] and a certain condition left
[1:02:17] but in our case
[1:02:19] blindness came
[1:02:21] but it alerted us to a another problem
[1:02:24] and that you know the devil is stupid
[1:02:30] and let me just
[1:02:31] clear the air for brother wayne now the
[1:02:33] devil is stupid
[1:02:36] had he not blinded me
[1:02:38] we would have never known that we had
[1:02:40] brain tumors
[1:02:43] and i would have been dead in only just
[1:02:45] a couple of weeks but because he is
[1:02:47] stupid
[1:02:49] we were able to get to the doctors and
[1:02:51] they would find the
[1:02:52] literally only a few days after brother
[1:02:54] wayne was here they would find the
[1:02:56] cancerous tumors in my brain and were
[1:02:59] able to the next friday be able to to
[1:03:02] remove a tumor about that size in my
[1:03:05] brain and it was laying on my on on my
[1:03:07] eye
[1:03:08] channels back there i forgot the word
[1:03:11] but that's where it was at so
[1:03:13] but anyway god rich and mercy spared our
[1:03:16] lives and we're a year later
[1:03:19] and this week we got wonderful news
[1:03:22] and we're happy about that and
[1:03:29] amen
[1:03:38] we told you of the dream last week of
[1:03:41] waking up and and brother branham had
[1:03:43] came to us
[1:03:44] and he gave me a green book
[1:03:46] and it was called the way of a true
[1:03:48] prophet and he asked me said would you
[1:03:49] like to have this book i used it tonight
[1:03:52] and i i looked through all my file
[1:03:54] cabinets in the last pocket i found the
[1:03:57] way of a true prophet
[1:04:00] in a green bound book
[1:04:05] amen
[1:04:09] and i choose to carry that book the rest
[1:04:11] of my life in my bible so so if you
[1:04:14] should ever ask that question i've had a
[1:04:16] prophet pat me on the cheek and tell me
[1:04:19] i'm going to get well
[1:04:21] amen amen so
[1:04:24] we're just so thrilled about that
[1:04:26] amen he's good to us sydney
[1:04:29] so i'm under i'm under expectations
[1:04:32] myself
[1:04:33] for this meeting for brother wayne he's
[1:04:35] been a real friend of mine for for a
[1:04:37] long time
[1:04:38] and and and he's just not an average
[1:04:40] preacher he
[1:04:42] he's a prince of preachers and so
[1:04:45] i i i think i think of i think of
[1:04:48] incredible speakers through the ages and
[1:04:50] and whenever i hear brother wayne he's
[1:04:52] like a lawyer and he just ties the devil
[1:04:55] in every kind of way in the world in a
[1:04:57] very quick way
[1:05:00] and i understand that there was a man
[1:05:01] named charles finney that was quite like
[1:05:03] that so
[1:05:05] so you might hear charles feeney preach
[1:05:07] for us tonight
[1:05:08] even greater than a charles feeney
[1:05:11] i
[1:05:12] i didn't come up to to do a whole lot of
[1:05:15] chit chatting but i'm on business
[1:05:17] our church is growing
[1:05:20] it's growing it's and we're really
[1:05:21] thrilled about it and sometimes it grows
[1:05:24] one at a time sometimes a family at a
[1:05:26] time
[1:05:27] but
[1:05:28] i have some wonderful news that we are
[1:05:29] going to grow in august
[1:05:32] august september-ish two at a time

[1:05:38] for brother justin and sister judy

[1:24:22] the battle
[1:24:23] iman you'll recognize this text from
[1:24:26] brother brown spoke on it several times

[1:24:30] it's a very familiar uh writing
[1:24:33] but well i want to speak to you tonight
[1:24:34] from it and if i would take a title i

[1:24:45] gospel
[1:24:46] amen knowing this that
[1:24:49] i believe i believe in positive things
[1:24:52] when you define the word positive it
[1:24:54] means expressed clearly
[1:24:56] or fully assured confident
[1:24:59] it means independent of changing
[1:25:01] circumstances
[1:25:04] unconditioned

[1:25:07] not fictitious but real

[1:25:20] of stimulation
[1:25:21] it means having higher electric

[1:25:42] positive point of view
[1:25:44] if you start looking at the synonyms it
[1:25:46] means to be sure or to be certain to be
[1:25:49] positive
[1:25:50] having no doubt or uncertainty sure
[1:25:54] usually stresses the subjective uh
[1:25:56] intuitive feeling of assurance see you
[1:25:59] felt sure that i've forgotten something

[1:26:07] of indisputable evidence see police are
[1:26:09] certain about a case of a fire because
[1:26:12] they have the positive evidence see

[1:26:45] tonight that the message that we are
[1:26:47] preaching is a positive word
[1:26:50] amen i believe that i believe the
[1:26:52] message of the hour is a positive word i
[1:26:55] believe it's something that you can rest
[1:26:57] your soul on amen i i come to you
[1:27:00] tonight in the middle of probably some
[1:27:02] of the greatest political disturbances
[1:27:04] that we've had in america since the
[1:27:06] civil war there's probably not been a
[1:27:08] more divided time among america
[1:27:11] in politics and and when brother branham
[1:27:13] preaches this message trumpet uncertain
[1:27:15] sound it's actually following the
[1:27:17] elections of kennedy and brother brown
[1:27:20] is discussing how that the election was
[1:27:22] rigged to go a certain way for the
[1:27:24] catholic president and he talks about
[1:27:27] that a little bit and he says and a lot
[1:27:28] of people has put their self he said
[1:27:31] into this politics and he said they've
[1:27:33] invested themselves and he said they're
[1:27:34] fighting and they're going that way he
[1:27:37] said and look how disappointed they were
[1:27:39] with the way this election and there was
[1:27:41] nothing they could do about it it was
[1:27:42] just the way it was there was nothing
[1:27:44] they could do he said the fbi even
[1:27:45] proved
[1:27:46] that they did it and they just didn't do
[1:27:48] nothing about it amen i think we're
[1:27:50] living back in about the same kind of
[1:27:51] time amen but look at this if you put
[1:27:54] your hopes in politics look how let down
[1:27:57] this election would make you if if
[1:27:59] that's all the hopes you had look at how
[1:28:01] you invest your life and and your
[1:28:03] efforts and look at politics how quickly
[1:28:06] they can just undermine it and it
[1:28:07] changes on you everything you thinks a
[1:28:09] certain way it ain't it ain't the way
[1:28:11] you thought it was there is nothing
[1:28:14] positive at all in politics it is
[1:28:17] constantly changing on you you you'll
[1:28:19] get behind a certain candidate and
[1:28:21] you're sure you'll get a certain view
[1:28:23] and you'll think that's the way it is
[1:28:24] and all of a sudden the whole thing will
[1:28:26] change on you overnight and you'll be
[1:28:28] standing looking like a fool because see
[1:28:30] there's nothing solid in it it's it's
[1:28:32] shifting sands it's politics amen
[1:28:35] i'll say it like this even when you come
[1:28:37] to religion there's really nothing solid
[1:28:40] left in religion
[1:28:41] religion has moved itself to the un
[1:28:44] unsafe and unsteady sands of human
[1:28:48] movement and intellect and and politics
[1:28:51] and the ideals of man and it's become so
[1:28:53] uncertain politics and religion is
[1:28:56] moving right together and to think that
[1:28:58] even not just religion but but churches
[1:29:01] itself not just the religious movement
[1:29:04] but churches themselves become uncertain
[1:29:06] i i can say to you tonight that that
[1:29:09] there's churches that's going to rise
[1:29:11] and there's churches that's going to
[1:29:12] fall amen you can go into man you can go
[1:29:15] into ministries and you can watch and
[1:29:17] you can just get yourself so built up in
[1:29:19] a man but men come and men go amen men
[1:29:23] rise and men fall churches come and
[1:29:25] churches go politics come and politics
[1:29:28] go amen and and when you're listening to
[1:29:30] brother branham he goes right through
[1:29:32] this line and he he makes it a dark day
[1:29:34] he picks politics church religions and
[1:29:37] ministries and he lines them all up and
[1:29:39] he spends about a half hour letting you
[1:29:41] know there's not one solid thing in any
[1:29:44] of it and he's telling you if you're
[1:29:46] building there you're on shifting sands
[1:29:48] and you're setting yourself up for a
[1:29:50] great disappointment in your life
[1:29:52] and by the time he gets done you begin
[1:29:54] to wonder really is there anything that
[1:29:56] you can trust is there really anything
[1:29:58] when a word prophet is telling you it's
[1:30:00] all shifting sands it's all shakeable
[1:30:02] it's all moving it's all a bottomless
[1:30:05] pit when you get to hear me is there
[1:30:06] really anything that you're able to
[1:30:09] trust and all of a sudden he'll ask you
[1:30:11] is there anything left is there anything
[1:30:14] that you can put your trust in is there
[1:30:16] anything that's solid is there anything
[1:30:18] that you can build on and it won't
[1:30:20] change tomorrow is there anything that
[1:30:22] you can put your life into amen that
[1:30:25] it's not going to change on you after
[1:30:27] you invest in it amen and i'll say what
[1:30:29] the prophet of god had to say he said
[1:30:31] i'm telling you the things of the earth
[1:30:33] is shaking and you cannot put confidence
[1:30:36] in them they're uncertain and
[1:30:38] everything's that's uncertain i'd just
[1:30:41] rather leave away from it i don't like
[1:30:43] that negative thing i don't like to get
[1:30:46] mixed up in the negative side
[1:30:48] i like it positive and i want to be on
[1:30:51] the positive side i like it positive and
[1:30:54] i want to be on the positive side is
[1:30:57] that right is there anything left i want
[1:30:59] to be where it's positive i don't want
[1:31:01] to be in the negative in abraham brother
[1:31:03] bam says it like this christianity has
[1:31:06] no negative nothing in it
[1:31:09] it's everything absolutely positive a
[1:31:12] man that becomes a child of god has a
[1:31:14] positive hold on calvary and calvary has
[1:31:17] a positive hold on him with the
[1:31:19] assurance by the almighty god by an oath
[1:31:22] to himself that he would raise them up
[1:31:24] in the last day and take them into glory
[1:31:27] there is no if and or nothing about it
[1:31:30] it's something that is positive amen in
[1:31:34] jehovah jiber brother madam says
[1:31:36] christianity is misrepresented to the
[1:31:38] people christianity has been represented
[1:31:40] to the people as a declaration of a
[1:31:42] creed but christianity is a living being
[1:31:46] jesus christ the resurrected god that's
[1:31:49] alive and among us now my goodness what
[1:31:53] is christianity really then amen it's
[1:31:55] not just church or religion or politics
[1:31:58] or ideas amen christianity is the
[1:32:01] resurrected jesus christ living inside
[1:32:05] an individual and there is nothing
[1:32:08] negative about that there's nothing
[1:32:10] negative about jesus raising and
[1:32:12] descending into the church of the living
[1:32:14] god and there he stands tonight in
[1:32:17] christianity jesus on the authority of
[1:32:19] the word brother man said christianity
[1:32:21] is a living being in mankind that's a
[1:32:24] proof of the resurrection of god's son
[1:32:26] who god is with us christianity is a
[1:32:29] living being amen and hear him he'll say
[1:32:32] that's the way real christianity is it's
[1:32:35] a living experience
[1:32:38] pentecost is not a denomination
[1:32:40] pentecost is an experience that anybody
[1:32:43] can have if they wish to have it it's
[1:32:46] something that you experience it's the
[1:32:48] holy spirit
[1:32:50] my goodness amen in 1963 brother branham
[1:32:53] preaches a message called the absolute
[1:32:56] amen isn't it beautiful the absolute he
[1:32:59] said i think that we need something to
[1:33:01] be positive
[1:33:02] some absolute that we can hold on to and
[1:33:05] know that it's true in this crucial hour
[1:33:08] like this we must have something that we
[1:33:10] know we are positive that it's right
[1:33:13] something we can hold on to now now know
[1:33:16] whether how this case is going according
[1:33:19] to webster an absolute is itself
[1:33:21] unlimited in power amen primary it's an
[1:33:24] ultimate it's an ultimate it's an amen
[1:33:27] it's an absolute amen it's the end it's
[1:33:30] everything and every achievement that's
[1:33:32] ever been in the world has been tied to
[1:33:34] some sort of absolute
[1:33:36] you cannot do anything unless there is
[1:33:39] something that you can hold on to
[1:33:41] amen you cannot build your life unless
[1:33:44] you're positive of what you're building
[1:33:46] on you can't get started unless you know
[1:33:48] where you're starting and man i think
[1:33:50] it's beautiful if you go into untrip a
[1:33:53] trumpet of uncertain sound brother adam
[1:33:55] begins to say he says listen is there
[1:33:57] anything certain then is there really
[1:34:00] anything certain the prophet of god said
[1:34:02] yes there is one thing certain and i'm
[1:34:04] glad to say tonight there's one thing
[1:34:06] that you can put your confidence in
[1:34:08] ensure that it's right everything else
[1:34:11] is gone amen this will be standing if
[1:34:13] you'll read in matthew 24 35 he said the
[1:34:17] heavens and earth will pass away but my
[1:34:19] word shall not fail
[1:34:22] god has a certain foundation matthew 24
[1:34:26] and 35 heavens and earth shall pass away
[1:34:29] but my word
[1:34:30] shall not pass away then brother branham
[1:34:33] said i'd rather be standing on the word
[1:34:35] of god than to be standing in heaven i
[1:34:38] would rather be standing on the very
[1:34:40] word of god and be standing in heaven
[1:34:43] because heaven can fail the earth can
[1:34:45] fail but the word of god it remaineth
[1:34:48] forever man when i think about this
[1:34:51] tonight i think if there's a surety
[1:34:53] somewhere then there is a foundation
[1:34:55] amen numbers the 23rd chapter and the
[1:34:58] 19th verse for god is not a man that he
[1:35:01] should lie neither the son of man that
[1:35:04] he should repent he has said and shall
[1:35:06] not do it or hath he spoken and it shall
[1:35:09] not make it good behold i have received
[1:35:11] the commandment to bless and he blessed
[1:35:13] and i cannot reverse it amen in psalms
[1:35:17] 19 and 7
[1:35:18] i love david singing i love how the man
[1:35:21] sung he had positive songs he said for
[1:35:24] the law of the lord is perfect
[1:35:26] converting the soul the testimony of the
[1:35:29] lord is sure
[1:35:30] making wise the simple in psalms 89 and
[1:35:33] 34 he said my covenant will i not break
[1:35:37] nor will i alter the thing that is gone
[1:35:40] out of my lips then you mean there's
[1:35:42] somebody that can say something that
[1:35:44] can't take it back
[1:35:45] there is somebody that can tell you
[1:35:47] something that when they say it they
[1:35:49] don't have to change it later they don't
[1:35:51] have to rearrange it later remember when
[1:35:54] they speak it it is settled it's the
[1:35:56] finish it's the end it's the ultimate
[1:35:59] it's sure it's positive it's reality
[1:36:02] it's true it's the amen amen listen to
[1:36:06] me when god speaks anything he cannot
[1:36:08] alter it after it comes out of his mouth
[1:36:11] because the word cannot pass away
[1:36:14] it cannot change it cannot alter my amen
[1:36:18] the solomon the wisest man in the world
[1:36:21] i think we should hear from him tonight
[1:36:23] he said every word of god is pure he is
[1:36:26] a shield unto them that put their trust
[1:36:28] in him in isaiah 40 amen isaiah had it
[1:36:32] well for the grass withereth and the
[1:36:34] flower fadeth but the word of our god
[1:36:38] shall stand forever
[1:36:41] in isaiah he says it again in the 55
[1:36:44] 55th chapter and the 11th verse so shall
[1:36:47] my word be that goeth forth out of my
[1:36:50] mouth it shall not return unto me void
[1:36:54] but it shall accomplish that which i
[1:36:56] please and that shall prosper in the
[1:36:59] thing where unto that i sent it whenever
[1:37:02] god speaks anything that word that
[1:37:05] leaves his mouth cannot be altered that
[1:37:08] word cannot return to him until it has
[1:37:11] completed what he sent it out to do god
[1:37:14] cannot call it home and say we changed
[1:37:17] our mind god cannot speak anything and
[1:37:20] re and bring that back to him before it
[1:37:23] completes itself do you see god is
[1:37:26] positive when he speaks a word it's a
[1:37:28] positive word it's sure it's settled
[1:37:31] it's the end god has the power to do
[1:37:33] whatever he says he's going to do listen
[1:37:36] friend i know tonight amen there's
[1:37:38] things in this world that is not sure
[1:37:40] amen and you've had experiences with
[1:37:42] them and they make you question other
[1:37:44] things but there is one thing in this
[1:37:46] world that you can count on and that is
[1:37:49] the word of god when god says anything
[1:37:52] that word is finished from then on until
[1:37:55] it fulfills let me let me just say this
[1:37:57] to you amen can you imagine isaiah when
[1:38:00] he was preaching one evening it might
[1:38:02] have been a sabbath evening and he he
[1:38:04] took the scriptures and began to preach
[1:38:06] and he got under the channel of
[1:38:08] inspiration you know a prophet's a
[1:38:10] channel don't you and he'll say things
[1:38:12] that he don't even think about because
[1:38:14] if he thought about it he wouldn't have
[1:38:15] never said it amen but isaiah was up
[1:38:18] there preaching and god had control of
[1:38:20] his mind and all of a sudden he blurts
[1:38:22] out and hears himself say a virgin shall
[1:38:25] conceive amen he didn't say i think she
[1:38:28] will or maybe she will he said a virgin
[1:38:31] shall conceive and a word went out of
[1:38:34] his mouth and now watch that word
[1:38:36] started circling the earth and brother
[1:38:38] branham said it circled the earth for
[1:38:40] hundreds of years because it couldn't go
[1:38:43] home it couldn't change itself and say
[1:38:46] well amen that maybe that's just not
[1:38:48] going to happen i got to go home i can't
[1:38:51] do my job i i don't have enough to fix
[1:38:53] or fulfill what god sent me to do amen
[1:38:56] but listen every word that god speaks
[1:38:59] has the power to fulfill the word that
[1:39:01] has been spoken no word that he utters
[1:39:04] does not have the power to fulfill what
[1:39:06] god utters it out to be amen do you
[1:39:09] recognize word cannot return until it's
[1:39:11] manifested amen word cannot return until
[1:39:14] it becomes flesh when god said a virgin
[1:39:17] shall conceive go back to genesis the
[1:39:19] third chapter and see if god didn't
[1:39:21] prophesy and say the woman's seed shall
[1:39:24] bruise the head of the serpent come on
[1:39:27] church it's a positive language amen the
[1:39:30] woman's seed shall bruise the head of
[1:39:32] the serpent the woman's seed amen was
[1:39:35] the virgin birth it was it was mary seed
[1:39:39] amen and it was a positive and couldn't
[1:39:41] return until it was fulfilled amen let
[1:39:44] me say this to you tonight god said
[1:39:46] there's going to be a bride god said
[1:39:48] there'll be a virgin bride god said
[1:39:50] there'll be a bride without puerto rico
[1:39:52] he had a prophet prophesy in this earth
[1:39:55] and began to prophesy over the church
[1:39:58] and said there's coming a rapture
[1:40:00] there's coming of bride listen william
[1:40:02] branham wasn't just another preacher he
[1:40:05] was a channel of god and when he spoke
[1:40:08] that word that word is hanging over the
[1:40:10] church of the living god and it cannot
[1:40:12] go home until it becomes flesh when the
[1:40:16] word returns back it will look like you
[1:40:19] and me
[1:40:21] amen when the word returns back it'll
[1:40:23] have to take flesh with it or it cannot
[1:40:26] return
[1:40:27] my goodness when i think about this it
[1:40:29] cannot be altered amen it cannot be
[1:40:32] changed amen do you know god is looking
[1:40:34] for a mary amen a place for the word to
[1:40:37] hang in the womb to manifest and fulfill
[1:40:40] what he has spoken titus 1 and 2 amen
[1:40:43] paul says it well in hope of eternal
[1:40:45] life which god that cannot lie promised
[1:40:48] before the world began
[1:40:51] in hope of eternal life
[1:40:53] which god that cannot lie
[1:40:56] promised
[1:40:57] before the world begins so the god that
[1:40:59] can't lie made a promise
[1:41:02] if you can get somebody who can't lie to
[1:41:04] give you a promise you got it wrapped up
[1:41:07] if you if you could find somebody that
[1:41:09] can't lie the only one we know of is god
[1:41:12] and if you can get him to give you a
[1:41:14] promise you got it wrapped up
[1:41:16] you know what i'm saying if you can if
[1:41:18] you can get somebody's word on it if
[1:41:20] they don't lie then that word is as good
[1:41:22] as anything you need because it's a sure
[1:41:24] foundation i just remember my little boy
[1:41:27] zac he just had this baby i remember he
[1:41:30] used to ask me said daddy i want to fly
[1:41:31] he loved flashlights kid loved
[1:41:33] flashlights and he said daddy i get a
[1:41:34] new flashlight and and just so he quit
[1:41:36] pester me after a while i'd say yes sure
[1:41:38] son you can have a new flashlight well
[1:41:40] in the morning he would wake up with and
[1:41:42] get his boots on he's ready to go to
[1:41:43] walmart you know and i said what are we
[1:41:45] going to walmart for he said well you

[1:41:51] words

[1:41:55] said i could have a flashlight and
[1:41:56] either i had to give him a flashlight or
[1:41:59] i had to lie to him amen so you see once
[1:42:02] he got my word he never let me forget
[1:42:04] that amen and do you know that you
[1:42:06] actually compliment god when you remind
[1:42:09] him what he said to you amen listen when
[1:42:11] god gives you his word it's his covenant
[1:42:14] and when god shakes your hand on
[1:42:16] anything he he loves it when his own
[1:42:18] people come back to him with what he
[1:42:21] told them he would do god loves it when
[1:42:23] that happens you know i think it's
[1:42:24] amazing brother bam tells a story about
[1:42:26] a man who was uh received a capital
[1:42:29] punishment was going to die and they
[1:42:31] took him out and the king he was going
[1:42:33] to give him his last wish and the fellow
[1:42:34] said really really what i want so as a
[1:42:36] good cold drink of water
[1:42:38] and the man said well
[1:42:40] i would like to have the kingston well
[1:42:42] you can have it he said yeah but i'm
[1:42:43] afraid
[1:42:45] that you're going to kill me before i
[1:42:46] get my water drink so i don't really
[1:42:48] want to ask for water the king said look
[1:42:49] i'm going to give you your wish
[1:42:51] i'm going to give you a cold drink of
[1:42:53] water and i promise you i will not kill
[1:42:55] you till you drink your water so they
[1:42:57] brought that water to him amen and the
[1:43:00] man got the water he looks at the king
[1:43:01] and he just dumps it out on the ground
[1:43:04] amen because the king told him i won't
[1:43:06] kill you till you drink the water so he
[1:43:08] had the king in a place amen they had to
[1:43:11] turn him loose he was never going to die
[1:43:13] amen because he had the word of a king
[1:43:16] well if you can get a natural king to
[1:43:19] back up his own word that strong how
[1:43:22] much more tonight if you get the word of
[1:43:24] the king of all kings amen how sure is
[1:43:27] that foundation tonight that there's a
[1:43:29] word that cannot alter as a word that
[1:43:32] cannot change
[1:43:35] mine the hope of eternal life in first
[1:43:38] peter chapter 1 and verse 25 but the
[1:43:40] word of the lord endureth forever and
[1:43:42] this is the word which by the gospel is
[1:43:45] preached unto you amen the word of one
[1:43:47] that can't lie is what the gospel is
[1:43:50] preached unto you revelation chapter 3
[1:43:53] and verse 14 and unto the angel of the
[1:43:55] church of the laodiceans write these
[1:43:58] things saith thee amen the faithful and
[1:44:01] the true witness the beginning of the
[1:44:04] creation of god amen the amen of god
[1:44:07] isn't that beautiful amen that when god
[1:44:10] speaks his word amen jesus is the amen
[1:44:13] of the word the holy ghost is the amen
[1:44:17] to the word of god i think about it
[1:44:19] tonight in isaiah it was written amen
[1:44:21] that he is the god of truth and brother
[1:44:23] man said it's better said he's the god
[1:44:25] of the amen in isaiah he said he that
[1:44:28] blesses himself is blessed amen in the
[1:44:30] god of truth or in the god of the amen
[1:44:33] in other words god he is the amen he's
[1:44:36] the absolute he's the thing that
[1:44:38] finishes you know when brother adam
[1:44:39] would finish his meetings many times he
[1:44:41] would say if what i've told you is the
[1:44:44] truth he said look he will come now and
[1:44:46] vindicate that or prove that and that
[1:44:49] angel would come in the room and back up
[1:44:51] what he was talking about amen how many
[1:44:53] times did we see it on tape or how many
[1:44:55] times did it happen time after time
[1:44:58] after time and the prophet would speak
[1:45:00] and god would show up and say that's an
[1:45:02] amen that's the word of god and let me
[1:45:05] tell you something tonight that same god
[1:45:07] is still alive and he's still coming
[1:45:09] into the church of the living god where
[1:45:11] this message is preached the god of the
[1:45:14] amen is still coming in those churches
[1:45:17] and saying amen to the word of god
[1:45:19] listen i don't have much use for a
[1:45:21] preacher that god don't back up amen i
[1:45:23] know there's a lot of intellectuals and
[1:45:25] i i know there's a lot of teachers
[1:45:27] giving us their opinion amen but i want
[1:45:29] to see somebody in the pulpit when they
[1:45:32] get done preaching that the holy ghost
[1:45:34] will come in the church of the living
[1:45:36] god amen and infuse the church with
[1:45:39] power and demonstration and
[1:45:42] manifestation we are not preaching a
[1:45:44] watered-down gospel with our gloves on
[1:45:47] this is the power of the holy ghost it's
[1:45:50] a reality in the age that we're living
[1:45:52] in this is god's word and he comes and
[1:45:56] says amen to his own word
[1:45:59] my goodness amen he is true to this word
[1:46:01] the prophet of god said he's true to
[1:46:03] himself he won't lie
[1:46:06] god is true amen god is faithful don't
[1:46:08] ever forget that god is right god is
[1:46:11] true and god is faithful amen he is true
[1:46:14] to himself he won't lie he is true to
[1:46:18] the word he will back it up he is true
[1:46:21] to us he will lose none of us her glory
[1:46:26] to god he's true to himself if he speaks
[1:46:28] something he won't lie he won't he's not
[1:46:31] a hypocrite god ain't double-minded if
[1:46:33] he says something he meant it and if he
[1:46:36] says it he backs it up amen and he's
[1:46:38] true to his people he will not lose one
[1:46:41] of his children let me tell you
[1:46:43] something tonight we are not living on
[1:46:45] on a like a cat on a chin roof wondering
[1:46:48] if god's about to lose us amen what do
[1:46:50] you think he's absent-minded or
[1:46:52] something amen but god has never
[1:46:54] forgotten nothing he's never forgot one
[1:46:57] thought if you ever was in the mind of
[1:46:59] god he still has you in his mind and
[1:47:03] he's not absent-minded but he give the
[1:47:05] blood to save every person that was in
[1:47:08] his
[1:47:09] my goodness he'll not lose a one it i
[1:47:12] don't know where he might have to go to
[1:47:14] find you but he's not going to lose you
[1:47:16] i don't know where he might have to turn
[1:47:17] over or what bar room he might have to
[1:47:20] put somebody in or what place you might
[1:47:22] have to come to but i'm servant of god
[1:47:24] that knows right where you are he knows
[1:47:26] right where to find you amen god didn't
[1:47:29] lose you he didn't lose me and he'll not
[1:47:32] lose anybody else and he's called to
[1:47:34] himself god is true he is true to his
[1:47:38] word he is true to his message he is
[1:47:40] true to his spirit god is not here
[1:47:43] tonight amen just trying to amen to
[1:47:46] dismiss us as a thought but he saves his
[1:47:48] people you're sure it's a word it's the
[1:47:51] truth
[1:47:54] oh i wish i had a better voice it's true
[1:47:58] yes it's the word of the lord
[1:48:00] he will not lose one
[1:48:02] amen i'll tell you what brother branham
[1:48:04] had to say about it he's true he said
[1:48:06] he'll raise him up
[1:48:07] he said this is a resting place in his
[1:48:09] faithfulness
[1:48:11] being confident of this very thing
[1:48:13] that he which begun a good work will
[1:48:15] perform it until the day of jesus christ
[1:48:17] you can be positive of this
[1:48:19] you can be confident of this
[1:48:21] if god started you he'll finish you
[1:48:25] amen let me tell you this he is the kind
[1:48:28] of
[1:48:29] can i say the coach
[1:48:30] he's the kind of coach who has a perfect
[1:48:33] reputation amen of first place runners
[1:48:37] and he won't pick somebody that he can't
[1:48:39] finish amen if he didn't think you could
[1:48:42] run he wouldn't have never chose you but
[1:48:44] he knew you could run so he chose you
[1:48:47] and when god chose you he knew exactly
[1:48:50] how you were going to finish amen that's
[1:48:52] why paul said amen unto him that
[1:48:55] finishes the race he meant looking to
[1:48:58] the author and the finisher of our
[1:49:00] foundation we are not looking at our
[1:49:02] ability tonight we're looking at the
[1:49:05] word and we're running like we've never
[1:49:08] ran before let me say this there's a
[1:49:10] bride that's not going to fall
[1:49:13] she's not going to stumble at the line
[1:49:16] she's going to finish this race
[1:49:20] can i can i say what a prophet said here
[1:49:23] he said it's not an uncertain sound
[1:49:26] god
[1:49:27] cannot give an uncertain sound
[1:49:31] my goodness amen in other words you
[1:49:33] you've heard people they mumble once in
[1:49:35] a while i've done it myself here's what
[1:49:37] they wasn't certain what i said
[1:49:39] lady said something to us at the
[1:49:40] restaurant last night who couldn't tell
[1:49:42] what she was saying he had that mask on
[1:49:45] and a little accent behind it after a
[1:49:47] while figured out it was lobster i i got
[1:49:49] it finally amen but it was it was a it
[1:49:51] was an uncertain
[1:49:53] i knew it was it was muttered
[1:49:55] amen i hope you hear me god cannot do
[1:49:58] that
[1:49:59] god cannot mutter and uncertain sound if
[1:50:02] god says anything it is certain
[1:50:05] amen it is true creeds cannot give amen
[1:50:09] they can give an uncertain sound
[1:50:11] denominations can give an uncertain
[1:50:13] sound but god cannot give an uncertain
[1:50:16] sound and the word is god
[1:50:20] the word cannot give an uncertain sound
[1:50:24] he meant god cannot
[1:50:26] utter an uncertain sound there is no
[1:50:28] uncertainty in it
[1:50:32] brother if the trumpet gives an
[1:50:33] uncertain sound who shall prepare for
[1:50:36] the battle amen then paul is not
[1:50:39] speaking about going to a picnic he's
[1:50:41] talking about going to war
[1:50:43] when paul is talking about this he's not
[1:50:45] talking about picnic man said we didn't
[1:50:47] come here to see how many people would
[1:50:48] agree with us he said we're in a war
[1:50:51] we're in a spiritual war
[1:50:53] it's not a war against flesh and blood
[1:50:55] but against spirits and and
[1:50:57] principalities and powers amen paul is
[1:51:00] speaking about soldiers he's not
[1:51:02] speaking about picnics he's talking
[1:51:04] about going into war
[1:51:06] and brother baum says it here now paul
[1:51:08] in the scripture says he's training a
[1:51:10] soldier to a sound
[1:51:13] training a soldier to a sound you're the
[1:51:16] soldier god's sound is the trumpet
[1:51:18] playing to the church
[1:51:20] now if you'll notice this he said then
[1:51:22] the trumpet say the gospel trumpet it's
[1:51:24] the word of the living god and it don't
[1:51:28] mix with anything
[1:51:31] if you mix it with something it becomes
[1:51:32] uncertain but if we just play the music
[1:51:37] if it's just the trumpet it has a
[1:51:39] certain sound it's a positive sound now
[1:51:42] now paul brother brown says he's talking
[1:51:44] about training a man to a sound
[1:51:46] revelation 1 and 10 you remember the
[1:51:48] scripture said that john was caught up
[1:51:50] in the spirit on the lord's day
[1:51:53] amen and he said i heard a voice as a
[1:51:56] trumpet behind me then so now he's
[1:51:59] parallel in a voice and a trumpet amen
[1:52:01] and it's a clear
[1:52:03] and distinct sound it's not muttered
[1:52:05] it's not confused it's clear distinct
[1:52:08] it's a sound of truth amen listen here
[1:52:11] it's a battle amen in this end time it's
[1:52:14] actually a battle for the truth that's
[1:52:16] where we are the prophet of god uses
[1:52:18] this and serves as this enzyme he says
[1:52:20] what is it it's a battle of truth for
[1:52:22] the things that's been lost down through
[1:52:24] the ages see down through seven ages
[1:52:27] paul started out with truth and they
[1:52:29] lost things down through the ages and
[1:52:31] brother bam said but in the end time he
[1:52:33] said there'll be a battle for truth he
[1:52:35] said that'll bring it back to all the
[1:52:38] ends that were lost so everything that
[1:52:40] we lost down through the ages god is
[1:52:43] going to send some soldiers in the end
[1:52:46] time that will battle for the truth that
[1:52:49] will tie the whole thing together
[1:52:52] oh you say well brother wayne i know
[1:52:54] we're in a war
[1:52:56] and and we're doing our best to cover up
[1:52:58] but you know can i can i give you all a
[1:53:00] little a little word here tonight hey
[1:53:02] man i i sometimes think that we are
[1:53:04] looking at this whole battle just a
[1:53:06] little wrong
[1:53:07] because we look at it like we're the
[1:53:09] defending group and we're trying to
[1:53:10] survive and we're trying to make it but
[1:53:12] do you know actually scriptural that's
[1:53:14] not true
[1:53:16] do you recognize amen that when the sun
[1:53:18] comes up in the morning that the sun
[1:53:20] itself is what causes the darkness to to
[1:53:23] pierce to the other side of the earth
[1:53:25] when you turn this light on in here amen
[1:53:27] it don't remove the darkness it it
[1:53:29] concentrates it in places it can hide
[1:53:31] from the light
[1:53:33] and when the light begins to shine in
[1:53:35] the earth amen the darkness compresses
[1:53:38] itself and becomes darker and thicker
[1:53:41] because of the light
[1:53:42] can i say this to you amen when a
[1:53:45] messenger comes in an age and begins to
[1:53:48] sound the jubilee trumpet or the gospel
[1:53:51] trumpet to the church it causes a
[1:53:54] spiritual war
[1:53:56] and that spiritual war presses against
[1:53:59] every dark spirit of unbelief that there
[1:54:02] is
[1:54:03] let me just put it within within a grasp
[1:54:06] of the way a hillbilly is saying amen
[1:54:08] they really ain't after you you're after
[1:54:10] them
[1:54:13] really at this moment you don't really
[1:54:15] realize this but the stands you're
[1:54:17] taking amen is a complete contrary stand
[1:54:21] to everything in this world
[1:54:23] amen everything that's in the world
[1:54:25] today is literally going 180 degrees the
[1:54:29] other direction but there's something in
[1:54:31] you that will press against every dark
[1:54:34] thing because there's something battling
[1:54:37] for the truth on the inside of you i
[1:54:40] maybe maybe could say it this way we're
[1:54:42] not here amen just to make peace with
[1:54:44] our enemy
[1:54:47] we're not here just kick our feet up and
[1:54:49] let the devil keep our kids
[1:54:51] amen
[1:54:52] i'm sorry i'm not that type of guy amen
[1:54:55] if the devil takes after one of my kids
[1:54:56] i get down on the floor somewhere and
[1:54:58] say satan that belongs to me
[1:55:01] take your hands off of that child that's
[1:55:03] my child amen i'm not one of them guys
[1:55:06] that just lays down my sword and bows
[1:55:08] down to any old devil wants to come
[1:55:10] along in my house or in the church or
[1:55:12] anywhere else there's something down on
[1:55:14] the inside of me amen that a war against
[1:55:17] any spirit of unbelief that comes near
[1:55:21] now now i say that tonight because you
[1:55:23] know when the children of israel when
[1:55:25] they crossed the red sea and they were
[1:55:27] running from the egyptians but when they
[1:55:29] went over into the into the jordan and
[1:55:32] they got to the jordan river do you know
[1:55:34] things changed at the jordan and they
[1:55:36] actually moved from a defensive to an
[1:55:38] offensive battle it went from running to
[1:55:40] an enemy into running to the battle they
[1:55:43] went from trying to escape the battle
[1:55:46] until they were the ones pushing the
[1:55:47] battle they literally went out there to
[1:55:50] the walls of jericho amen where little
[1:55:52] rahab was amen do you all know amen that
[1:55:55] rahab couldn't come out in the jubilee
[1:55:58] amen because she was behind the walls
[1:56:01] and she was a gentile so whenever the
[1:56:03] jubilee comes she was not able to come
[1:56:05] out at all but look at what god did amen
[1:56:08] he could have delivered jericho many
[1:56:09] ways but because of his own law
[1:56:12] preventing rahab from being brought out
[1:56:13] behind them walls by a trumpet god
[1:56:16] decided amen if i can't bring them out
[1:56:18] i'll tear the walls down amen you know
[1:56:21] what god did he instructed joshua to
[1:56:24] tear down the wall amen that was holding
[1:56:27] his child do you know god will not leave
[1:56:30] a wall when a child of god's at stake
[1:56:33] and god will not leave something just in
[1:56:35] his place but he'll tear that down watch
[1:56:37] what he done he instructed joshua to go
[1:56:40] out there and take the take the priest
[1:56:42] and and take their trumpets and they
[1:56:44] took seven of them and and they was walk
[1:56:46] around one time a day and blow their
[1:56:47] trumpet and up through seven ages one
[1:56:50] messenger per age would walk around and
[1:56:53] the people were quietened and the
[1:56:55] trumpet was blowing one one in age
[1:56:57] amen but when you come to that seventh
[1:56:59] one
[1:57:00] amen seven trumpets blowed at the same
[1:57:03] time
[1:57:04] in other words it was just one messenger
[1:57:06] but you were hearing seven thunders it
[1:57:09] was just one messenger but he was tying
[1:57:11] up every loose end from paul all the way
[1:57:15] to the end time in other words his
[1:57:17] message wasn't just one age he was
[1:57:19] collecting the truths throughout seven
[1:57:22] ages and preaching them in one message
[1:57:28] you see what you do you don't have to
[1:57:30] dig through all the history books to
[1:57:31] find the truth now
[1:57:33] you don't have to dig through all the
[1:57:35] men that went on to find out what the
[1:57:37] truth is now am i have i got some
[1:57:39] liberty here amen you see there there's
[1:57:42] some uh there's some guys that's leaving
[1:57:44] and then they're they're they're running
[1:57:45] for the hills i guess i don't know
[1:57:46] what's battle with them amen but they
[1:57:48] started claiming that brother branham
[1:57:50] got his ideas from a guy named larkin
[1:57:53] and they they were saying the other day
[1:57:55] one of them was saying uh well you know
[1:57:57] he said brother ram took this from
[1:57:59] larkin took something else and this and
[1:58:00] that and act like larkin had a had all
[1:58:03] this and brother bam come in behind him
[1:58:04] and i'm sitting there listening to him i
[1:58:06] thought it was funny because see i i
[1:58:08] study i study a lot of books and i've
[1:58:10] read a lot of books and everything that
[1:58:12] he was saying i knew 10 years ago i went
[1:58:14] through dispensations of larkin 10 years
[1:58:16] ago i studied all those books read all
[1:58:18] those things found out what the prophet
[1:58:20] said about them amen so when he come
[1:58:22] along and said that i just kind of
[1:58:23] chuckled because i know the rest of the
[1:58:25] story amen because see charles larkin
[1:58:28] was not a prophet and he didn't sit down
[1:58:30] somewhere in a room and an angel come to
[1:58:32] him and give him all that and brother
[1:58:33] branham just copy it that's not the way
[1:58:35] it happened at all but charles larkin
[1:58:37] borrowed things that was taught from
[1:58:39] paul all the way up to his day he took
[1:58:42] things from all kinds of theologians and
[1:58:45] he collected this see the people that
[1:58:46] say brother brown copied larkin don't
[1:58:48] tell you where larkin got what he got he
[1:58:51] got things from all of those men down
[1:58:53] through the ages but when brother
[1:58:54] branham read them charles larkin was not
[1:58:57] positive on many things he would come up
[1:59:00] and he'd say well maybe it's this or
[1:59:02] maybe it's that we're not really sure
[1:59:04] you know what that's called it's called
[1:59:05] a loose end i give you two scriptures
[1:59:07] and i caused the question and i never
[1:59:09] answered it amen but william branham
[1:59:11] took what larkin did and brought it out
[1:59:14] into the positive and took and said this
[1:59:17] is that and this is that scripture and
[1:59:20] this is that scripture you see what it
[1:59:22] was god was using him to tie those loose
[1:59:25] ends together and he took things that
[1:59:27] they knew and then finished the sentence
[1:59:30] listen friends this message isn't just
[1:59:32] another idea this message is the word of
[1:59:36] the lord in the age that we're living in
[1:59:39] you can rest your soul
[1:59:43] yes sir you can rest your soul
[1:59:46] upon this message it's not just another
[1:59:49] good idea amen it's god's grace to the
[1:59:53] age that we're living in my when i look
[1:59:55] at this and i see what happened really
[1:59:58] amen then joshua when they began to blow
[2:00:00] them trumpets and that message come out
[2:00:02] with all the ages in one message amen
[2:00:05] everything larkin had and everything
[2:00:07] luther had and everything wesley had and
[2:00:10] everything paul had it sounded under one
[2:00:13] message
[2:00:14] are you hear me and what happened that
[2:00:16] trumpet ignited something it didn't just
[2:00:19] blow but it ignited a voice in the
[2:00:22] entire people of god and the bible said
[2:00:26] they become one voice and the walls had
[2:00:29] to come down let me tell you something
[2:00:31] tonight this message has made one voice
[2:00:34] it's made one bride that's saying what
[2:00:37] the message says and that message is
[2:00:40] saying tear down the wild and let the
[2:00:43] children of god come out into liberty

[2:00:49] tonight amen but i believe it's time to
[2:00:51] declare war on every denominational

[2:06:43] run up on them beaches
[2:06:45] and they got guns narrowing down on them
[2:06:47] and bombs going off around them and they
[2:06:49] find out why it's necessary
[2:06:51] and you know what i found out why things
[2:06:53] are going good and the church is in good
[2:06:56] good shape and everything's happening
[2:06:57] and you got preachers preaching the
[2:06:59] baptism of the holy ghost as people said
[2:07:01] why is that necessary
[2:07:03] why is it necessary to tell people about
[2:07:05] the holy ghost and new birth and the
[2:07:06] gifts of the spirit and the power of god
[2:07:08] we don't even need them things brother
[2:07:10] man said but listen he said don't you
[2:07:12] don't you ever let the devil reason you
[2:07:14] out of that
[2:07:15] he said see that backpack is necessary
[2:07:18] see in that that same thing
[2:07:20] the holy ghost is necessary and he said
[2:07:23] listen that devil to try to reason you
[2:07:25] out of that and he'll say it's not
[2:07:28] necessary he said but if god says it's
[2:07:31] necessary if we've got to cry and boohoo
[2:07:34] and do all of this if god said the
[2:07:36] baptism of the holy ghost is necessary i
[2:07:38] don't care how heavy it is
[2:07:40] it don't matter how much of the world
[2:07:42] you have to give up you're going to have
[2:07:43] to use it one of these days the only way
[2:07:45] of survival
[2:07:47] amen you you hear me the holy ghost is
[2:07:49] not only necessary amen there will come
[2:07:52] a time it's your only way of survival
[2:07:55] it's the baptism of the holy ghost and
[2:07:57] we've got we've got so-called preachers
[2:07:59] today that don't even believe in the
[2:08:00] baptism of the holy ghost you can
[2:08:02] mention the holy ghost and they'll get
[2:08:04] blushed in the face and call you a
[2:08:05] pentecostal but listen let me tell you
[2:08:08] if god said we need the holy ghost amen
[2:08:10] you'll have to have it to survive amen
[2:08:12] that's why when we're in the middle of
[2:08:14] this pandemic that there's some people
[2:08:16] amen that can't keep the pace hey man
[2:08:19] they seem like they're getting colder
[2:08:21] and colder but really what they need is
[2:08:23] a good baptism of the holy ghost amen to
[2:08:26] let their life come into line with the
[2:08:29] word of god listen to me brethren the
[2:08:31] prophet of god said this he said them
[2:08:33] brethren he said then brethren they come
[2:08:35] out on the day of pentecost he said they
[2:08:37] were convinced we needed it
[2:08:40] he said they were convinced that's all
[2:08:42] the people needed
[2:08:44] now it wasn't only necessary brother
[2:08:45] brahm said the early disciples decided
[2:08:47] that was the only thing you actually
[2:08:49] needed was the holy ghost because a
[2:08:52] prophet brought that in line he said
[2:08:54] when you receive the holy ghost
[2:08:55] everything you have need of is actually
[2:08:58] already in you he said actually the
[2:09:01] rapture is already in you
[2:09:04] listen church amen we don't have to have
[2:09:06] a storehouse of 100 things to go if
[2:09:09] we've got the holy ghost it's what's
[2:09:11] necessary to get us where we're going
[2:09:18] it's becoming very unpopular to preach
[2:09:20] on the holy ghost these days hey man but
[2:09:22] it's still necessary come on now that
[2:09:24] can you oh god i'm gonna preach it okay
[2:09:26] if i preach hey man look what's
[2:09:28] happening around here hey man we we're
[2:09:30] getting us a bunch of cowards around
[2:09:31] this message they're literally turning
[2:09:33] yellow on us they run it at the whim of
[2:09:36] every little problem and every situation
[2:09:38] they just take off like a coward hey man
[2:09:40] you know what they're doing now they're
[2:09:42] telling our pastors they are to sit down
[2:09:44] and just play a tape you ain't supposed
[2:09:46] to preach anymore amen you know what i
[2:09:48] think it is i think they're cowards i
[2:09:50] don't think they have the strength to
[2:09:52] stand in a pulpit and preach the message
[2:09:55] but they'll put brother branham out in
[2:09:57] the front and let him say it let him
[2:09:59] stand it well listen this is one
[2:10:01] preacher i want to put my voice with the
[2:10:04] voice of a prophet
[2:10:06] i don't want brother branham just to
[2:10:08] have to stand alone i don't want to put
[2:10:10] him out there by himself hey but i want
[2:10:13] to stand where a prophet stood i want to
[2:10:16] go the way a true prophet goes and stand
[2:10:19] right where he stood
[2:10:23] i don't want to die coward if i die let
[2:10:25] me die with a sword in my hand let me
[2:10:28] die fighting amen let me let me have the
[2:10:31] way of the apostles of god they cut
[2:10:34] their heads off and they boiled them and
[2:10:37] they hung them on crosses but they never
[2:10:40] defeated them
[2:10:42] they never defeated them
[2:10:44] you can kill me but you can't defeat me
[2:10:46] [Applause]
[2:10:48] oh you said preacher what are you saying
[2:10:49] i'm saying there's a faith that comes in
[2:10:51] the church of the living god and i'll
[2:10:53] master every circumstance there's a
[2:10:55] faith real faith a perfect faith he'll
[2:10:58] master every circumstance you say
[2:10:59] preacher i know some circumstances but
[2:11:01] the book of john said faith is that that
[2:11:04] overcometh the world and brother ben
[2:11:06] said you say well he didn't know what i
[2:11:08] was going through brother bam said
[2:11:09] that's why i said the world he said
[2:11:11] everything was included in that faith is
[2:11:14] the victory that overcomes everything
[2:11:17] it'll overcome every situation it'll
[2:11:19] overcome everything that you're going to
[2:11:21] meet he says he's the faith amen that'll
[2:11:23] master every circumstance now you've got
[2:11:25] to think about this because there's
[2:11:27] going to be some points it didn't look
[2:11:28] like you mastered amen listen apostle
[2:11:31] paul amen was the faith champion in
[2:11:33] hebrews 11 chapter go read that chapter
[2:11:36] go read it one time but don't stop until
[2:11:39] you get to the end and you see some of
[2:11:41] them faithful with saul asunder and some
[2:11:43] of them was burnt and fed the lines but
[2:11:46] they were every one masters they mean
[2:11:48] listen paul was sitting there with his
[2:11:50] head on a chopping block and he looked
[2:11:53] in the face of death and said death
[2:11:55] where's your stream and grave where's
[2:11:58] your victory i've already got the
[2:12:01] oh
[2:12:02] you'll never you'll never kill a saint
[2:12:04] no sir amen amen he that liveth and
[2:12:07] believeth to me shall never die
[2:12:11] so preach what are you saying i'm saying
[2:12:13] there's a faith that can move into your
[2:12:14] heart tonight move you out of any
[2:12:15] circumstances
[2:12:16] any search you know what i'm saying you
[2:12:19] can't just float around in the church
[2:12:20] though
[2:12:22] brother man said a man come to this door
[2:12:24] i wanted food he said where are you from
[2:12:25] he said no where were you going nowhere
[2:12:27] bubba said see he was just floating
[2:12:29] around
[2:12:30] he said we don't want to become floaters
[2:12:31] in the church
[2:12:32] we don't just want to float along with
[2:12:34] it do we
[2:12:35] he said what you needs a purpose
[2:12:38] he said in other words you need to get a
[2:12:40] promise
[2:12:41] and focus your life on that promise if
[2:12:43] god said we can have the holy ghost and
[2:12:46] you don't have the holy ghost put that
[2:12:48] in your focus and stay there till you
[2:12:51] get it
[2:12:52] [Applause]
[2:12:54] now watch this brother bam uses this and
[2:12:56] how can i overcome and he goes into a
[2:12:58] couple different messages but he uses
[2:13:00] this uh chronology
[2:13:02] and our example and it was good for me
[2:13:04] as i grew up on a river and he said go
[2:13:06] down to river and he said watch in the
[2:13:07] corners river and he said you see all
[2:13:09] them log piles
[2:13:10] he said see that wood what it does is
[2:13:12] it's just floating along
[2:13:13] he said in every time it comes to a
[2:13:15] corner it just hangs up
[2:13:17] do you see what it is if you're just
[2:13:18] floating along there's going to be a
[2:13:20] place you're just going to hang up
[2:13:22] and you can't go no further there's
[2:13:23] scrap heaps in every corner of a church
[2:13:26] amen there's there's turns that happen
[2:13:28] in the churches they've been changes and
[2:13:30] situations and there's there's a family
[2:13:32] that wasn't that wasn't after nothing
[2:13:34] they were just floating along and
[2:13:35] they're on the side amen all across the
[2:13:38] planet there's people with their
[2:13:39] feelings hurt sitting at home tonight
[2:13:41] amen upset at the pastor upset at
[2:13:43] somebody else upset it something else
[2:13:45] you know why they're home because they
[2:13:47] were just floating along and they had no
[2:13:50] they had no view they had no vision they
[2:13:52] had nothing they was after because if
[2:13:54] they had been after something you
[2:13:56] couldn't have run them off with a team
[2:13:58] of mules if you get somebody that wants
[2:14:01] something you can't make them get away
[2:14:03] from you
[2:14:05] come on church y'all know what i'm
[2:14:06] saying there was a little woman went to
[2:14:08] jesus and he called her a dog and she
[2:14:10] said well even the dogs get the crumbs
[2:14:13] from the master's table amen if you ever
[2:14:15] get to a place you want something from
[2:14:18] god can't nobody run you off can't
[2:14:21] nobody be mean enough to you to run you
[2:14:24] off
[2:14:26] you know what it is brother graham said
[2:14:28] that same piece of wood that hangs up in
[2:14:29] the corner he said if it ever gets in
[2:14:31] the hands of the master it becomes a
[2:14:32] boat
[2:14:33] and he said that boat needs a power on
[2:14:35] it and he said that power is the holy
[2:14:37] ghost and if you've ever been on a river
[2:14:38] it's necessary to have a motor if you
[2:14:41] want to get around the corners get your
[2:14:42] motor one time and you know what will
[2:14:44] happen when you get to them little
[2:14:46] shallow spots you ever been on a river
[2:14:47] you get them little shallow spots or
[2:14:48] gravel or sand hey man you get them
[2:14:51] little spots and you can't see them till
[2:14:52] you get there and you feel them they'll
[2:14:54] just snug the bottom of your boat and if
[2:14:55] you don't have a motor you'll hang up
[2:14:57] and have to get out and drag your boat
[2:14:58] right there but if you've got your
[2:15:00] little motor on there you can hit the
[2:15:02] motor about right there and you'll just
[2:15:03] power through it and let me tell you
[2:15:05] something tonight this bride is a
[2:15:07] masterpiece and she's being powered amen
[2:15:10] by the presence of the almighty god
[2:15:13] there's something here tonight when we
[2:15:16] hit a shallow spot we ought to just
[2:15:18] power right through it i don't believe
[2:15:20] we have to stand still or get out of the
[2:15:23] boat i believe all we got to do is use
[2:15:26] what god gave us to power through this
[2:15:29] thing tonight he said well i've come up
[2:15:31] to the hard places of my life well use
[2:15:32] that motor he gave you
[2:15:34] pull the pull the throttle back and and
[2:15:37] move into the presence of god there's a
[2:15:39] presence here tonight that'll move you
[2:15:42] you say my hey man you're awful positive
[2:15:45] about this well i got some examples
[2:15:48] i got some examples brother ma'am said
[2:15:50] jesus is the prime example
[2:15:53] when he was in his weakest condition and
[2:15:55] satan was in his strongest he stood on
[2:15:57] the word
[2:15:58] and he said it is written
[2:16:00] amen because the word is sure brother
[2:16:03] braham said he said see see amen i don't
[2:16:06] know what he's going to do but he will
[2:16:09] do it
[2:16:10] amen do you see in in in the book of
[2:16:12] kings when elijah was in a horrible
[2:16:14] shape it was there that god told elijah
[2:16:17] to go down by the brook cherith and he
[2:16:19] said i have commanded the ravens to feed
[2:16:21] you there
[2:16:23] now the brother brother brahm said it
[2:16:24] like this i have commanded the ravens he
[2:16:27] said that wasn't a hope so i think so or
[2:16:30] maybe so he said but elijah was going to
[2:16:32] get fed at that brook amen elijah had
[2:16:35] said the man said those ravens couldn't
[2:16:37] go kill a beef and pack them he said and
[2:16:39] he had no clue how god was going to do
[2:16:41] it but god said he was going to do it he
[2:16:44] had already commanded the ravens before
[2:16:48] elijah ever got there and you see what
[2:16:50] he said brother ram said the same way he
[2:16:53] said god has commanded his spirit unto
[2:16:56] all men he meant you see if god has
[2:16:59] already commanded it amen then then it's
[2:17:02] not a matter of whether god will give it
[2:17:05] or matter of will god wants to give it
[2:17:08] god has already given his spirit 2 000
[2:17:12] years ago he poured his spirit out upon
[2:17:16] the church and is just as real tonight
[2:17:19] as it was 2 000 years ago
[2:17:22] [Applause]
[2:17:24] my goodness he commanded his spirit unto
[2:17:26] all men he commanded his blessings and
[2:17:27] he's ascended on hind gave guests unto
[2:17:29] men
[2:17:31] how's it going to come i don't know
[2:17:34] i don't know how it's going to come but
[2:17:35] this promise is unto you and them that
[2:17:37] are far off even as many
[2:17:39] as the lord our god shall call acts the
[2:17:41] second chapter and the second chapter in
[2:17:43] the 38th verse apostle peter told us if
[2:17:45] we would repent and be baptized in the
[2:17:47] name of jesus christ we shall
[2:17:50] then now that's not a question that's a
[2:17:53] shall
[2:17:54] receive the holy ghost
[2:17:56] you know i was just preaching preaching
[2:17:58] on this back home a month so ago the
[2:17:59] lord being given to me and we had nine
[2:18:02] young people
[2:18:03] in a set of four meetings that got the
[2:18:05] baptism of the holy ghost
[2:18:07] one of them sitting right here tonight
[2:18:08] maybe two of them i can't remember the
[2:18:10] testimony but no one of them for sure
[2:18:11] sitting right here tonight that received
[2:18:13] the holy ghost in those meetings
[2:18:15] you say preacher what are you saying i'm
[2:18:17] saying that god is give it if we'll
[2:18:19] preach it
[2:18:20] god has given if we'll believe it god
[2:18:23] has given if we'll make room for him to
[2:18:25] give the holy ghost to somebody it's a
[2:18:27] necessary thing in mark the 16th chapter
[2:18:29] do you know jesus actually said unto us
[2:18:32] that if we would go to the world and
[2:18:34] preach the gospel amen that he that
[2:18:36] believeth is baptized shall be saved and
[2:18:38] in my name they shall cast out devils
[2:18:41] and they shall speak with new tongues
[2:18:42] and they shall take up serpents and if
[2:18:44] any deadly thing it shall not hurt them
[2:18:46] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[2:18:48] they shall
[2:18:50] recover see how certain that is and they
[2:18:53] shall recover now i know we're living in
[2:18:55] an age where people don't speak in
[2:18:56] tongues anymore i know it's almost
[2:18:58] become a a taboo in the church but jesus
[2:19:01] said we'd do it do y'all know jesus died
[2:19:03] speaking in tongues do y'all know the
[2:19:05] last words of his life was speaking in
[2:19:07] tongues amen do you know it's not
[2:19:09] something to be ashamed of
[2:19:12] brother matter of fact said if you stay
[2:19:14] in prayer long enough you will do it
[2:19:17] i'm positive about that
[2:19:21] in john the 10th chapter jesus said my
[2:19:23] sheep
[2:19:25] they know
[2:19:27] my voice
[2:19:29] my sheep
[2:19:30] know my voice see how solid that is they
[2:19:33] know
[2:19:35] they won't even they won't even follow
[2:19:36] something uncertain
[2:19:39] i sure miss you up here buddy
[2:19:41] amen they won't even they won't even
[2:19:43] follow
[2:19:44] do you see what it is a sheep needs
[2:19:46] sheep food those disciples when they
[2:19:49] sing the word manifested
[2:19:51] they know that was sheep food
[2:19:54] they know that was the trumpet
[2:19:56] they started following that my sheep
[2:19:58] know it because they sing the word of
[2:20:00] god being manifested
[2:20:04] now
[2:20:05] brother branham ties directly my sheep
[2:20:07] they know my voice
[2:20:09] the real sheep now the end of this quote
[2:20:11] the real sheep don't listen for that
[2:20:14] they listen for the trumpet they listen
[2:20:17] for the positive
[2:20:19] a real sheep will listen for that
[2:20:21] positive word
[2:20:23] they'll listen to that now
[2:20:24] see jesus told peter he said now if you
[2:20:27] love me
[2:20:29] feed my sheep
[2:20:31] if you love me
[2:20:33] feed my sheep i remember years and years
[2:20:35] and years ago when i was on the field i
[2:20:36] mean 20 something years ago and i hadn't
[2:20:38] been i hadn't been going long and
[2:20:40] everybody they was asking me are you an
[2:20:42] evangelist are you apostle or you pastor
[2:20:44] you teacher i didn't know what it was
[2:20:48] i just wanted to serve the lord
[2:20:50] hey man that's all i want to do serve
[2:20:51] the lord and people got to say well
[2:20:53] you're an evangelist and i got to listen
[2:20:54] to other evangelists and i said well
[2:20:55] maybe i don't know don't sound like them
[2:20:57] but i don't know
[2:20:59] we little different i don't know they
[2:21:00] think a little it's just different i
[2:21:02] don't know what to say about it so i was
[2:21:03] in there praying one day and i was
[2:21:05] actually driving down the road i think i
[2:21:06] was down around beaufort actually south
[2:21:08] carolina and i was driving down through
[2:21:10] there and i was telling the lord how
[2:21:11] i've been a failure and what i'd done
[2:21:13] and all these things and all of a sudden
[2:21:15] i don't know if i was listening to the
[2:21:16] scripture or reading it but what but it
[2:21:18] come across this point here where peter
[2:21:20] amen had failed the lord and after the
[2:21:21] resurrection remember the lord went and
[2:21:23] hunted peter up
[2:21:24] and he asked him three times said do you
[2:21:26] love me
[2:21:27] and peter said yeah and he said do you
[2:21:29] love me he said yeah
[2:21:31] he said peter do you love me he said
[2:21:33] lord thou knowest
[2:21:34] amen
[2:21:35] you know you know i've been messed up so
[2:21:37] much i don't know what to say anymore
[2:21:39] amen but the lord looked right at him he
[2:21:41] said peter if you love me
[2:21:43] you feed my sheep
[2:21:45] and you know right in that moment
[2:21:47] brother that's when god commissioned me
[2:21:49] and he told me you feed my sheep now
[2:21:52] i'll tell you what that's what my
[2:21:53] purpose has been for the last 20 years
[2:21:55] it ain't been to build anything it ain't
[2:21:57] been to be somebody but it's been to
[2:21:58] serve the lord and serve the sheep food
[2:22:01] to the church of the living god wherever
[2:22:04] i preach i want to preach a positive
[2:22:05] message wherever i preach i want to
[2:22:07] preach something and the prophet of god
[2:22:09] said he said sheep food that they're
[2:22:12] looking for real sheep it means there's
[2:22:15] life in it
[2:22:17] if we're going to preach something
[2:22:18] there's got to be life in it and jesus
[2:22:20] said my word is life
[2:22:23] my then there's a people here tonight
[2:22:26] that will not stagger at the promises of
[2:22:29] god through unbelief they will not
[2:22:31] stagger but like their father abraham
[2:22:34] they are fully persuaded
[2:22:37] in the promises of god they are
[2:22:39] convinced and they're not ashamed to say
[2:22:41] so amen brother branham says that he
[2:22:44] said there these men were persuaded and
[2:22:46] he said the thing tonight is are you
[2:22:48] persuaded he said are you fully
[2:22:50] persuaded that he is the holy ghost are
[2:22:53] you persuaded this is the right way are
[2:22:55] you persuaded he's a healer are you
[2:22:58] persuaded he's coming again are you
[2:23:00] persuaded that he's the same yesterday
[2:23:03] today and forever are you positive this
[2:23:06] is right
[2:23:08] are you positive it's the word of god
[2:23:11] listen what he's saying jesus when he
[2:23:13] was here he told him before abraham was
[2:23:17] i am
[2:23:19] look what he was that wasn't i hope so
[2:23:21] think so maybe so i am when he went to
[2:23:24] the tomb of lazarus he said i am the
[2:23:27] resurrection and the life amen you say
[2:23:29] well preacher i mean that's jesus but
[2:23:32] but but jesus wasn't uncertain about it
[2:23:35] amen and brother adam said you don't
[2:23:36] have to be uncertain either
[2:23:39] to think tonight you don't have to sit
[2:23:40] here in confusion you don't have to live
[2:23:42] your life in confusion you can be a
[2:23:45] certain about your destination as jesus
[2:23:48] was his
[2:23:50] i'm i'm i'm not going to read them to
[2:23:53] you because of time's sake but i'm
[2:23:54] telling you i'm quoting a prophet you
[2:23:57] can be just as certain about your place
[2:23:59] and your destination as what jesus said
[2:24:02] when he said take this body and put it
[2:24:04] in the tomb and three days i'll raise it
[2:24:06] up again he said do you see how certain
[2:24:09] that was amen and the church of the
[2:24:11] living god can be just as certain
[2:24:14] tonight amen that if if i don't live for

[2:24:19] somewhere brother you mark it down i'm
[2:24:21] going to come out of that tomb you know
[2:24:24] how i know it because the life amen that
[2:24:27] raised up jesus christ is the same life
[2:24:30] that's in my body right now i'm not
[2:24:33] going to receive that life someday in
[2:24:35] the future i already received the
[2:24:39] baptism of the holy ghost everything i
[2:24:42] need to climb out of the grave is
[2:24:44] already in me
[2:24:45] [Applause]
[2:24:46] you know what brother man said about it
[2:24:47] he said you put me in the grave he said
[2:24:49] the spirit that's in me will see that i
[2:24:51] get a new body
[2:24:53] the spirit that's in me will see i get
[2:24:55] out of the grave it'll see that i raise
[2:24:58] up
[2:25:01] do you know he said the spirit that's in
[2:25:03] you right now
[2:25:04] could go speak a world
[2:25:06] of your own and you could live on it
[2:25:10] there's nothing uncertain about this
[2:25:13] nothing uncertain you can be positive
[2:25:16] can we be that positive
[2:25:18] can we can we be that positive
[2:25:21] brother brown said it's an example i am
[2:25:23] the resurrection in life he said now
[2:25:25] watch jesus knew
[2:25:27] where he belonged in that scripture
[2:25:30] he said now if i'm the person over there
[2:25:33] in john 5 and 24
[2:25:36] if i'm that person in john 5 24 you all
[2:25:39] know what it says
[2:25:40] listen what it says
[2:25:42] verily verily
[2:25:44] i say unto you he that heareth my word
[2:25:46] and believeth on him that sent me hath
[2:25:48] everlasting life and shall not come into
[2:25:51] condemnation
[2:25:52] but is passed
[2:25:54] from death unto life
[2:25:56] y'all want to reread that with me the
[2:25:58] first two words
[2:26:00] verily verily means
[2:26:02] positively
[2:26:04] positively
[2:26:06] it's not very very it actually means
[2:26:08] positively
[2:26:09] positively i say unto you do you see if
[2:26:13] you're that person in john 5 and 24 you
[2:26:15] can join job's words when he said i know
[2:26:21] i
[2:26:22] know
[2:26:23] my redeemer liveth you can see you say
[2:26:25] that tonight i know
[2:26:28] you don't have to sit here tonight and
[2:26:29] wonder amen where this is going to come
[2:26:32] you can actually sit here tonight and
[2:26:34] receive the baptism of the holy ghost
[2:26:37] which is the identification
[2:26:40] of who you are
[2:26:42] you can be positive
[2:26:44] that you're a child of god
[2:26:46] accepting your identification
[2:26:48] let me let me just read you what brother
[2:26:49] branham says about it
[2:26:51] he says it's a positive token when i see
[2:26:54] the token
[2:26:55] i will pass a positive token the holy
[2:26:57] spirit is our token
[2:27:00] therefore when you receive the holy
[2:27:02] ghost you pass from death unto life
[2:27:04] that's all there is to it
[2:27:06] because life is in you
[2:27:08] you can no
[2:27:10] more perish
[2:27:12] in the token brother madam will say this
[2:27:14] the holy ghost is the token
[2:27:18] that we have been pardoned
[2:27:20] the case
[2:27:22] is
[2:27:23] closed
[2:27:25] no more wearing
[2:27:27] and we're wondering
[2:27:29] if you're sitting here with the holy
[2:27:30] ghost tonight you are to be the most
[2:27:32] positive person in this world
[2:27:35] may not be positive about the politics
[2:27:39] let me be positive about the religion
[2:27:41] we don't be positive about the future of
[2:27:42] this world
[2:27:44] but we are positive where we're going
[2:27:47] we're positive what's going to happen to
[2:27:49] us
[2:27:50] that positive reality is here tonight
[2:27:53] can you stand to your feet with me
[2:27:57] i am positive
[2:27:59] this is
[2:28:01] a positive gospel
[2:28:05] this is
[2:28:09] a positive gospel
[2:28:13] when you see that token over that door
[2:28:18] it was a positive sign
[2:28:20] that there had been a death of a lamb
[2:28:23] and to think tonight
[2:28:26] that you have got a positive sign
[2:28:30] the lamb died rose again
[2:28:33] and you're sitting here with that life
[2:28:34] tonight and positive
[2:28:35] positively positively
[2:28:38] he that believeth on me
[2:28:41] think of that
[2:28:43] that god himself
[2:28:45] would come down in your humanity
[2:28:48] and testify the same thing that he did
[2:28:50] in the scripture
[2:28:52] that there's life already in the body
[2:28:56] you love him tonight
[2:28:58] that's just by our hearts
[2:29:02] would you want to be positive
[2:29:05] wouldn't you want to know for sure

[2:29:11] doubt tonight
[2:29:16] wouldn't you wouldn't you want that to
[2:29:17] be a positive
[2:29:20] not just floating along
[2:29:23] not just coming to the church and just
[2:29:25] moving along with it
[2:29:27] it's not necessary for me to give my
[2:29:29] life and to
[2:29:31] pour it in like that listen friend
[2:29:33] tonight
[2:29:34] [Music]
