going over the prayer request he sounded like he was saying brother ronald and his family had head colds but that was my fault my bad handwriting but it was brother randall and his family uh they would have been here this weekend but uh he and his family had hit colt so he wanted to just send his love to each and every one of you and i advised him to stay home and rest up and come next weekend and uh you know take care of yourself and so we're just we'll be praying for him i know his heart's to be in the house of the lord and and i thought brother donnie did all right winging it without a guitar player this evening and amen we certainly love brother donny and his gift and amen god's good to us i always sing that song let the glory of the lord rise amongst us before we go to the word this evening let the glory of the lord rise among us let the glory of our lord rise among us let the praises out of our king rise [Music] let the songs rise among us [Music] [Music] just let it rise

[Music] hallelujah won't you give the lord a hand clap a breeze hallelujah let the praises of our king [Applause] let our eyes amongst us that's who we've come to worship in spirit and truth let his praises let his praises loose in the house of god hallelujah oh don't you love the king of kings and the lord of lords hallelujah we're in a season of worship let's worship hallelujah blessed be the name of the most high god amen if you have your bibles this evening would like to look again in the book of psalms chapter 63 psalms chapter 63 hallelujah certainly praying for brother william and his family we can prepare and we can plan but death is something that you don't necessarily plan for and you can so we as a body want to surround brother william and his sin in entire family with prayer and love and and our hearts go out for him i believe that you'll be flying out monday and uh there for the funeral on tuesday so we just want to be remembering brother william as he's traveling and coming back home and and that that love also extends to sister gabrielle and them and and we we certainly certainly love brother william and his family and he's such a part of our immediate family and such a part of our church family and we're just blessed to have brother william amongst us amen psalms chapter 63 and as we spoke from this this scripture several weekends in a row here i'd like to speak from it again but i'd like to speak to you this evening on the evidence the evidence of life this is a psalm of david when he was in the wilderness of judah he said oh god thou art my god is it your god this evening early will i seek thee my soul thirsteth for thee my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land where no water is to see thy power and thy glory so as i have seen thee in the sanctuary because thy loving kindness is better than life my lips shall praise thee thus will i bless thee while i live i will lift up my hands in thy name my soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips when i remember thee upon my bed and meditate on thee in the night watches because thou has been my help therefore in the shadow of thy wings will i rejoice let's just take our hearts and our needs before the maker of heaven just now heavenly father we approach your throne of mercy and grace lord humbly we bow our hearts lord we ask father that you would extend the scepter of mercy and grace lord upon our lives lord you see us in in our situations you see us in our life and you see every detail of it father lord we know that you are the designer of it all and we're so thankful to have a father that knows us by name lord i pray that you would just come in this service lord and minister to your children those that are listening by the way of the internet or go back and listen to this in a later date i pray father that you would make yourself real to the congregation of god bless your people touch the needs lord brother randall and his family and brother titus and i ask god that you would extend your mercy to every uplifted request and every unspoken request we pray that you would show yourself god to not set us down over in a corner and begin to use our body like never before we ask these things in the name of the lord amen you can be seated this evening so sad would like to speak to you on the evidence of life brother branham speaks on this subject of life or the path of life and thirsting for life many times but in in 1958 when he was preaching in in bangor there he he made this he made this comment and i was going over these i went over about every every sermon brother branham spoke on on life and brother branham this this this text stuck out to me said when i read that scripture verse he said i thought what could the prophet be meaning it's an unusual text thy loving kindness is better than life i thought there must be many interpretations to life and it could not mean the life that we now live in the flesh because that life has heartaches that life has sorrow and that life gets so bad sometime sometimes until men want to take piss take a pistol and blow his brains out so that couldn't be the life that he was talking about but it must be another life it must be another life that he's speaking of that life gets so miserable until people climb to a high tower and jump off and commit suicide they take poison and they take poison and tens of thousands a year over the united states where we where we ought to be living at the highest rate of life so it must have another interpretation so as david takes this text that thy loving kindness is better than life and we realize that that the life that that david was speaking of is not this life in the flesh but it was the life that only comes from above and then we go back and we begin to study in the bible that that in the beginning when god when we would look when god created man that god created adam and adam adam had the rights to life he had the rights to the tree of life and he never would have had to die because god began to breathe in him the breath of life but adam we know was told that he that the day that he eat off of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil that day he would surely die but we know that day that adam when he began to eat off of that tree off of the tree of knowledge of good needle that he began to die from that time but we know that the bible would tell us that adam lived to be some 930 years old but what did he lose he lost the rights to that tree he lost the power he lost the he lost the virtue he lost the quality of life what did he do he lost the original life and we know that the book of deuteronomy it means two laws and god has two laws and it is that of the law of death and is that of the law of life and there we recognize when when eve in direct disobedience to what god had said had turned down life there on the other side of the picture we see that there is a redeemer that is going to step in and and to come back to give that original life and restore that life back to his believing sons back to his believing sons and daughters of god and paul would say in galatians 2 and verse 18 he said if i build again the things which i destroyed i make myself a transgressor can you imagine somebody going in and purposely building down burning down a city and then going back and building that up again and paul is saying that if i return again to the sins which i have abandoned i am i am the one and i take the full responsibility upon myself he said if i go in and build again on the things that i have destroyed i have myself had made myself return transgressor so you can no longer blame god on what you did because you went back and you went back to the mud hole that you came out of but notice what paul says in verse 19 he said for i through the law am dead to the law that i might live unto god you see the law condemns you the law condemns you to death the law doesn't give you an escape route but the gospel gives you a way out the gospel gives you the access to life and we can come boldly before the throne and mercy of god but notice what he said in verse 20 he said i am crucified with christ nevertheless i live yet not i but christ that lives in me and the life which i now live in the flesh notice notice the life that he was living where did that life come from it was not the life that he had previously lived but it was a new life he said in the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me and jesus said in john 5 and 24 and verily verily i say unto you that he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come unto condemnation but is already passed from death unto life so it's an amazing thing to be able to recognize that you have already passed from death into life by accepting and believing it's not just a easy confession of i believe but this is hearing and doing and acting upon the very word of almighty god but the evidence of life is not the materialistic things that you have been given in life it's not how long that you live in life and many times when you hear us speak at a funeral you'll hear us say something about the dash in the person's life that there was a day that they began and there was a day that they're ending the day the dash is what really that person was and what they did with their life it's not how long you live that equates how powerful or the quality of your life but it's if you serve the author of life it's not happiness how happy you are in your life that determines the evidence of life it's not the family that surrounds you that determines your life but it is the ability to be able to say amen to the word of god that is the evidence of the holy ghost it is the evidence of life we know that god is life now notice notices this quote in possessing all things he said if you've never received the holy ghost as of yet and don't know nothing about it and something in your heart's telling you that you want it you stay right there can you say amen to the word of god that's eternal life that's what you're heir to stay right there and look satan right in the face and say you are the robber you are the one i've come to possess what jesus died for me to have now hand it back get out of my way just stand right there that's eternal life when you when you know that you're looking at the holy ghost and you haven't received it yet but you stand right there it's the greatest thing that you could ever attain in this life is the baptism of the holy ghost of not just on the flesh but on the inside of your soul that he sits there as the king of your heart and you stand right there and you can stand toe to toe with the devil and say you are the robber you are the one you have stood in my way all of my life you have stood in the path of me getting everything that i need in this life get out of my way then the first thing you know the holy ghost will pour upon you then something happens something will happen what is it god vindicated he keeps his word that's just exactly then see then after you see the word is vindicated then you that you're saved you do have the holy ghost then what abraham had won the victory and here he comes marching back he was going down with his faith laying on the word notice his faith laying on the word that he could bring it back what he had lost and here he come back with it marching the victor's marks and that's the same thing that you can do if you don't have eternal life ask god it's the greatest thing that you can ever have in life is eternal life ask god confess your sins believe on the son of god accept the baptism of the holy ghost and say god i come for it i'm here to receive it then you come back the victor's march you got it hey man just shining my the birds singing different everybody you're in love with everybody then oh some people need to have that song sung in their heart everything shining the birds singing different everybody you're in love with everybody then you remember when brother branham said hey but when you go to pray through if you come up and everybody don't look clean to you you need to go back down and pray again but when you pray through really pray through everybody around you your enemies you love them the people that hated you the people that mocked you the people that that said all kinds of evil things about you my you don't want to see nothing don't done anything to them but you love them what is it that old hatred that malice that strife has done gone love everybody oh you're just having a great time singing shouting praising god don't care what anybody says about you it's all right sure you're on the victor's march you know you know i i know that this time this season of life there or the generation of life that we're living in but sometimes sometimes you just you go through life and sometimes you just need a win are you with me sometimes you just you know you go through life and everybody if you lose everybody well it's okay it's okay everybody it's okay it's good it's a good learning curve for you it's a maybe it's a character building but sometimes in life you need a w in life you need a win you need to you need a victory you need to be on a victory march a man when you win i tell you the world we live in today man it's everybody if if you lose you get a participation award everybody's a winner nowaday but in a generation where i was from if you won you won baby man you was happy to win but now everybody gets a participation award for everybody was in it now it was you it's the biggest loser but we got an award for you at the end of life's journey i don't want to be giving out a participation award i want to have an award that i stood for jesus i stood for life i stood for the holy ghost i was not a participator i was not a spectator but i was somebody that was in that thing to win that thing it's good to have a victory every once in a while and that's what abraham was doing he was marching back with the victory [Applause] notice paragraph 73 he said then who come out to meet him then who come out to meet him you think about this you think about this how powerful your victory was how powerful your your approach and how powerful everything that you brought back but notice who came back to meet him who come out to meet him who come out to meet him melchizedek came out to meet him after he had had the word vindicated melchizedek was the one that gave him the word hallelujah it's a sure win for you the church of the living god the one that gave you the word is the one that's going to meet you the one that told you you're going to have your mom and daddy is the one that's got the word to back up what he said the one that's got your healing is the one that wrote that word the one that said he's got our protocols as the one that wrote that word he is the author and the evidence of the life in the church of the living god then he put his word his faith on the word and got the victory and returned back then he had fellowship now i want you to receive this i want you to receive this as thus saith the lord for you amen now you will too now you will too look at your neighbor and say now you will too you've been out fighting for your family all week you've been up against all kinds of hell this week now you will too melchizedek has come by your way to give you a victory to give you substance to give you faith to give you overcoming power now you will too oh his word will become something new to you whenever you once get the baptism of the holy ghost oh my you can't say well i can't see you you could say you say well i can't see those things i don't believe in shouting i don't believe in speaking in tongues i don't believe in divine healing it just shows that you never got the victory that's right but one time you get the victory then you got it then you have it yes sir then you can shout you ever get the victory one good time you'll know what you're shouting about you've got to dub you you're fighting with the king of kings and the captain of the lord told that he never lost the battle and he ain't planning on losing a battle what was israel doing they were shouting before they ever got to victory they were shouting before they ever got to victory and you see some people you watch a man alive they have been through you've been through some chaos i'll just talk about everybody you've been through some chaos you've been through some storms lay out a seal flipped you upside down if you were in a car man alive you'd haven't had a roll bar if you wouldn't had a roll bar you wouldn't have made it through this week but man alive you watch them come in there on saturday how it must upset hell as the children of god begin to walk back into the house of god he'd done everything against them but there is something on the inside of a body and oh before they ever seen their victory they begin to shout [Applause] there's power in your shout there's real power in your shout on the other side of your shout is your prodigals on the other side of your shout is your healing on the other side of your shout as your family on the other side of your shout it is the evidence of the holy ghost there's something laying there now let me let me speak to you let me speak to you in the in the natural realm let me speak to you this thing now shouting is not the evidence of the holy ghost now speaking in tongues is not the evidence of the holy ghost but it is a channel it is a channel and when you begin to get in that channel you begin to open up something are you with me now let me just bring it to you when i now a man of god when i or another minister when he begins to when he begins to come and bring forth the word of life he's already in a channel he already knows what god's been dealing with him about and he begins to he begins to look at scriptures and he he'll put scriptures with this quota put scriptures with this he'll begin to move illustrations around and he moves stories around and you watch as the man of god as it becomes more than just a sermon but it becomes a reality he begins to get in a channel and then it's one of the most amazing things when a man of god begins to preach the living word you watch as somebody as they begin to get in tune with the spirit and they begin to get in the channel as the man of god begins to speak as he begins to move and he'll think man i'll put this scripture over here i'll put it over here and all of a sudden the holy spirit says speak that scripture right now and you watch somebody's life as they're just begin to feed on the word of god they're getting in a channel they're getting in a channel and you don't realize what that person's doing but they're all mad they're in a channel and if you could see them on the other side of that pipe is their victory and they're pulling on it they're pulling on it and they're just doing everything they can to get that victory out of there because they know they know if they can get that pipe open there's going to come a blessing behind it and so they begin to work on that man of god and all of a sudden that man of god takes a scripture and man the whole thing opens up and it looks like an ocean's pouring over that individual why because somebody refused laodicea to be lay on a sea of them they refused the devil to be the devil to them but they accepted god to be god [Music] and they begin to get in a channel and man alive all of a sudden the holy spirit begins to gush out on them you remember when brother branham would teach us in the church age books i believe it's in the patmos vision hey there was a patmos he said he talks about getting in the spirit he he said he he starts he starts talking about getting in the spirit and he and he starts talking about healing he said now he said if you if you ever get in the spirit of healing you'll call on the elders you anoint yourself of all you'll pray and you'll believe it and that'll be it he said there's no other court of appeal there's no other court of appeal it's settled right there he said now many times he'll say in a different place he said many times people take the word and they'll run off with it and they're just hanging on to their emotions he said but they never got into the spirit of it he said but if you can ever get into the spirit he said don't he said begin to take the word and act on the word and you begin to move in that channel get in the spirit of it act upon the word now you've been to church all your life but start acting what if you would start getting in the spirit before you ever got church what if you begin to get in the spirit of worship before you ever entered the building you begin to act on the word and then you see the word come to fruition now now let me i think i got part of that quote here let's see here i do praise the lord i was right it was a batman's vision one i was right one time now notice he said but have you ever noticed how the world gets in the spirit of things that that that are in the world he said they go to their ball games they their sporting events and their dances they enter in the spirit of it they don't sit there like wallflowers or dried up sticks they enter right into the feel of things and they become a part of things but oh how they hate the christians for getting in the spirit of god now i know some of you think i'm reading this i know you know the the the context but i know that some people may think that i'm reading this to get you excited i want to prove you i want to prove you wrong right here he said they call us fanatics and holy rollers there is nothing they won't do to show their hatred and disapproval but ignore that you can expect it knowing where it's coming from just go on and get in the spirit of worship now notice he said our spirit is clean it is fresh it is real it is sober and serious but nonetheless it is full of the joy of the lord it's not your emotions that you're getting you excited about sure you'll get emotional sure you'll get excited when the word of god but there's a reason behind it now there's a lot of people that come to worship and they only worship because they're happy but you watch that person when they ain't happy they ain't worshiping you see because happiness and joy are polar opposite happiness depends on circumstance happiness depends if the marriage is happy happiness depends if the wife is happy happy wife happy life happiness depends on circumstances but joy doesn't look at circumstances joy looks strictly at the word of god joy says i'm happy in my soul whether i got money in a bank or i got sickness on my body i got joy i got joy well this joy that i have happiness didn't give it to me you ain't serving god just because you're happy joel osteen will make you happy he'll tell you he'll put money in your wallet if you do this if you give 99 1999 right now i'll give you these four books and my you'll be blessed but i want to tell you if you'll give your ten percent i ain't selling you no book but god will bless you coming in going out [Applause] happiness ain't built on if you got a new car if you got a some people only happy when they got a new girlfriend new boyfriend all kinds of things but the joy of the lord is our strength weeping may endure for more but joy is coming in the morning when david wrote that prophetic word he said thou will not serve the holy one to seek corruption you won't leave my soul in hell he said thou wilt show me the path of life and in thy presence is joy in thy presence is joy it's the fullness of joy notice that's where it's at well you're just reading it to get them excited all right all right if it don't get you excited something's wrong but but notice what he goes when he say to say he said the christian ought to be just as exuberant and full of the pleasure in the lord as the world is when it savors and delights in its pleasures notices both christians and the world are human both have emotions your emotions is not the evidence of life but notice he said but the difference is the christians hearts and emotions are purely on the lord of glory and his love while the world satisfies the flesh that's where the christian's heart is set on is the glory and the praises are purely on the lord and him only that's where our anchor is remember brother brown he was he he he would tell he would tell in absolute 1963 right before he goes into the seals he tell he tells about a girl that he used to go with i believe her name was norma and said he said he said he begins to tell about that little girl and she began she began to get famous and she married she married a a mechanic and a machinist and different things and her family got real popular in singing and different things and one of the children or the grandchildren had got got got got caught up by or was trying to live right for christ and got too much pressure on her and brother branham would say in the message absolutely he said she she got to a spot that she had a breakdown she got to to a spot that she had a breakdown because she was being teased for trying to live right and she had a mental breakdown and they took her to the doctor and the doctor gave her all kind of uh of shark treatments and brother barum said it actually made her worse and they was going to take his it was going to take his little girl about 15 16 years old and he said she was a real beautiful young girl and he went in there and or they were getting ready to take her to the insane institution in three days and the mother and the mother and the mother was just all excited about everything but notice what she she said these words you go listen to it she says we're not defeated you know god listens to what you're saying there's power in your words and if you if you're living a defeated life at most the time most of the time it's because of what's coming out of your mouth some people enjoy sickness because they worship that thing watch what's coming out of your mouth but notice she said we're not defeated let's call brother branham and she called brother branham he told him the circumstances said would you come up here and the doctor wouldn't let him come in so he said now he said you just tell him i'm a friend don't tell him i'm a minister and he went up there and that little girl was throwing herself around in the bed and different things and and there she was she said she said billy she said if we're at we're at our wit's in here if god doesn't do something they're going to take her up there and it'd probably be the last time that we see her and brother mariam said they didn't put no bid posts or different things on there so they wouldn't hurt so they wouldn't hurt themselves people like had in that condition he said but he said i sat down on one side of the bed and the mother was sitting on the other side and he said now don't get all excited don't get all excited and he said all of a sudden there became a vision there there's a vision come forth and he began to see that little girl and he he seen that there was a boy there and he looked back and he said he said now sis he said but does she have a boyfriend does she have a boyfriend that helps him in the singing or or different things she said absolutely describe the man to her he said well then thus saith the lord she's coming out of there let's say the lord says coming out of there and brother barum said he left the building went home and he said two hours later he said they've been trying to call me all that time he said and when they finally got a hold of me he said they gotta hold him said billy it was in 20 minutes there wasn't no change at all in her she was still in that same condition but in 20 minutes she was in her right mind again because there was a mama that was willing to hang on to thus saith the lord that vision was her absolute it was her ultimate and when you make the word of god your ultimate when you make the word your absolute it is the evidence of almighty god you're not anchoring in emotion you're not anchoring in emotions you remember me telling you about the lawyer last weekend the lawyer got so excited got so emotional but he didn't have one iota of law in it but if you can put the word where the word said it would be the word you'll line up and everything will come to pass oh is there somebody that's willing that's willing to put everything in their life on the word of god i need it for my healing i need it for my family i need it for my business i need it for my church i need it for my i need it for my lost loved ones i need this without this your loss without him let me say this without the word it's a word or nothing for me this is your last hope when you come to the last breath in your life you better have the word of god on your side one breath away from here you'll know whether this message is right or not but i choose right now as joshua said as for me and my house we will serve the lord i'm willing to stand with the lord's despise few them 30 minutes went fast no turn with me second peter 1 16. let me see if i can do a brother joel here get my parachute out god bless you brother joel ii peter 1 16 for we have not followed can you say amen cuddly device fables when we made known unto you the power and coming of our lord jesus christ but were eyewitnesses of his majesty for he received from god the father honor and glory when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory saying this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased and this voice which came from heaven we heard when we were with him in the holy mountain verse 19 we have also i want you to say that we have also a more sure word of prophecy whereunto you do well to take ye take heed as unto a light that shineth in dark place until the day dawn and the day star arise in your hearts knowing this that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man but holy men of god spake as they were moved by the holy ghost you go through the prophecies you go through the old testament and you begin to see as men of old were moved by the holy ghost to say those things but we realize that god doesn't need anybody to interpret his word he interprets his own word god identifies it by his own interpretation and we realize that his interpretation is when he brings it to pass just like in the beginning when he would say let there be light and there he vindicated the word by bringing forth the light and we realize that the manifestation of god's revealed power is the vindication we realize that it was christ and abraham it was christ and isaac it was christ and jacob it was christ in moses and all the way down through those prophets all that the prophets had foretold everything when when jesus was standing there when jesus was healing he was fulfilling scriptures when jesus was showing love he was fulfilling scriptures when jesus was laying hands on a sick he was fulfilling scriptures when he stood there and he took of the book and read isaiah 61 that the spirit of the lord has anointed me and he stood there and said this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears jesus was the interpretation god didn't have to interpret it but jesus's life interpreted it notice notice in then jesus came and called he said you say then brother random what is the evidence what is the evidence the vindication of the word in the hour that is the evidence the vindication of the word in the hour he said they they had the bible he they had the bible he was exactly what jehovah said would happen it don't need any interpretation it interpreted there there was a priest there was all they had and everything else just so routine everything but yet they failed to see the word and he made the word live out for that age that's the evidence of the age luther had the evidence of his age wesley of his age pentecost of its age but we're in another age he said those things are good he said but it's like a baby that's got a finger and an eye and a nose but after a while he has to become a human being it's like a mother carrying a seed a baby in her womb she's got life there but she can't fellowship with that life there's a lot of people that want to say that that ain't life and it's a woman's choice to say whether that's life that's absolutely false god said that yall art fearfully and wonderfully made i knew you before you were formed in your mother's womb there's life there but you can't have fellowship with that life until it becomes a human until it comes in a body form notice he could not fellowship in luther like he is fellowshipping today he cannot fellowship with wesley like he is fellowshipping today moses couldn't preach noah's message pentecost couldn't preach our message but our message is fellowship with the headship of jesus christ i say this to you this is that that was prophesied by the prophet joel and this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears give the lord praise hallelujah remember brother marion would talk about that chinese laundromat coming over here how do you come over here and he when he first come over he didn't know how to write anything so he would come over here and they were great laundromat and different things but they didn't know how to write so if you take in your dirty clothes to him you take your dirty clothes in there he would give you a little slip of paper he didn't write anything down on it but he would take that slip of paper and he'd rip it down the middle and when you come back to get your belongings you had to have that slip of paper and that thing had to perfectly dovetail with with his side of things so so you could take your dirty clothes in there and you could take them in there and you could get a slip of paper but when you come back with that same slip of paper you could get your dirty clothes back clean and let me say this to you that jesus christ matched everything that was said in the old testament that was told by the prophets that he was jehovah of the old jesus christ of the new testament matched everything that was there laying there in scripture prophecy was being fulfilled again brother branham said let me say this with all respects and all sincerity and all reverence in my heart he said the message of the hour has matched every word of this hour and i'm willing to stay here say with all of my heart i stand with this message i stand with william branham i stand with jesus christ because it dovetails perfectly with the scriptures of this hour hallelujah what is it you are in the spirit you're in the spirit of it let me say let me say like this on rapture morning it will be for a people that are in the spirit of the rapture when you watch somebody when all of a sudden it comes their time it comes their time for a blessing and what are they doing they're getting in the spirit of it they're getting in the spirit if you watch somebody that's calling on god believing for a miracle they're getting in the spirit of a miracle and i want to declare to you right now that we are in bible days again and jesus christ is still healing jesus christ is still feeling jesus christ is still safe jesus christ is still delivering and this is melchizedek that is standing here doing the work what are you watching you're watching somebody greater than a man stand there remember when brother branham was standing there in johannesburg and there was a there was a boy that was crossed out and brother brown said he was hideously cross-eyed he said hideously cross-eyed and they they brought they brought him up brother baron never prayed over him he never said nothing over him but he turned he said now turn and look at the people and his eyes were completely normal he never prayed for him and there was a doctor there was a doctor that made a big stir and come up there and i believe it was mr uh brother baxter and they were trying to hold the doctor back saying now wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute so now i i know that boy i'm the one that brought that boy here said brother random jew hypnotized that boy he said well no i didn't hypnotize and he said you were standing closer than i was to him i didn't hypnotize him he said he said now look he said i watched that boy walk up there cross-eyed he said i watch him walk up here cross hide he said but now he's perfectly well he said what happened he said i'll tell you what happened he said that in between me and him there was a holy spirit standing there and in between being cross-eyed and being perfectly well he met the holy spirit let me say this in between this platform and your seat stands the holy spirit it's not the man of god it's the holy spirit that's doing the work it's the holy spirit that's saving it's the holy spirit that's going out on the stream and setting the captives free it's the holy spirit in between here in the pulpit what is it it's melchizedek this is that [Applause] what was it jesus's life was the interpretation of it and god is god he he'll foreordain all things and if you go and you study that word for ordained it's rendered that which is before or known before now i'm i it's been my pleasure to be the associate pastor here along with brother ron for all these years and we're we're very connected we're a connected group of people you're a mature group of people we we eat on this word we're family thank god for all the other churches in the world but i'm so thankful for gospel lighthouse but but my my point my point right here is we're family we're connected we're tight we we we we have a chain of a community man we're strong but i i personally i'm personally not involved in every single one of your lives i'm not with you on your day-to-day basis i'm not making you living right i'm not making you i'm not holding your hand i'm not putting the pacifier in when it needs to be put in i'm not pulling out when it needs to be pulled out i'm not that kind of pastor i'm not that i'm not that tight with you i don't know everything that's going on i don't know everything that's going on but here is a god that foreordained all things that he knew before he knew where you'd be sitting at and you get um so upset somebody takes your seat got another visitor i won't be sat next to mom but god is the god that knows before he's so planned out the word rendered it means to know to know before it's a father that knows all the stars in heaven and calls them by name he sees every sparrow that falls and he numbers the hairs of your head but notice he foreknew what would happen he knew what would happen in the days of abraham it was prophecy of isaac there was promises that were hanging there that were foreordained that there was going to come forth his son he knew who he would be and it would not be ishmael he there was a promise hanging there that there would be a family there would be children that would come and they would possess the very land look out on it but but notice when abraham went over there in the city of guerrer notice when the king of gurir began to look out across the kingdom and he seen a fair maiden out there he looked out upon sarah notice he took sarah he took sarah he was not just wanting another woman in his kingdom he was wanting to make her his wife notice what the king was expecting he was expecting more than just another woman in the kingdom but notice how the spirit of the lord is so watching over top of you that he knows where you're at he knows where you're going and he dealt with the king of gorier in the night season and says don't touch that woman that's an anointed woman restore the man his wife god is not willing that sarah's womb would be contaminated with the king of another kingdom but there was a king that was coming it had to come from from a restored and come for a holy lineage and god's not willing that your womb would be contaminated in your spirit contaminated in your mind battle off the enemy that keeps telling you that you're gonna deal with that torment all of your life there's too many people there's too many young people nowadays that are continuing to live in torment torment over mind battles torment over things that they've done i want to tell you i'm completely off subject i'm completely off of my text right here but i want to tell you you don't have to be tormented no more to a minute in your night seasons tormented in your spirit we realize that that's where the battle is fought but stop that battle right there by the word of the living god cast satan down let me let me finish let me finish with this thought remember when brother brandon my brother brandon was was there he said i woke up real early in the morning and he said there was a demon standing in that corner they said people think they they know what demons are he said but you run into them all headlong all day he said but there was that that demon standing there he said a hideous looking thing standing there in that corner and he said he was he was accusing me he said he looked like alley-oop look like that no i know a lot of young people don't understand what that but it's a cartoon back in the day in a newspaper they made newspaper back in the day you millenniums it was a piece of paper that you folded back and you looked at it and we only looked at the cartoons all the old people looked at the dibituary and made sure they weren't in it it was a blessed day if you weren't in it can you say amen hallelujah i'm enjoying my jesus how about you he said but there was hallelupe in that corner he said he just he said he kept accusing me and telling he said he said he tried to wake up meet and see if she seen that he said no that would scare her to death he said but there he was accusing me saying you have no power you're nothing but a bluff you have no power he said then all of a sudden he said i said satan you're an offense to me and he said he said in the name of the lord jesus christ get out of here and he said he was complete he completely was gone that's what you need to say to that tormenting spirit is satan you're an offense to me in the name of jesus christ get out of my mind get out of my family get out of my home satan you're an offense to me you're offense to me you are not who i sue you i'm not who you say i am i'm going to be what the king says i mean not what you say of me saying your offense to me he said then all of a sudden he said there came the sweetest voice i'd ever heard and said don't you ever fear to go anywhere or do anything for the never failing presence almighty god is with you wherever you go don't you fear to go anywhere little bride don't you fear to go anywhere or do anything for the never failing presence of our lord jesus christ is with you satan you're an offense the evidence of life is not what you see one of one of the greatest sermons i think that's ever been preached through the airwaves was preached last weekend look past what you see these things will pass away but this that gene seed of god that eternal word that satan can't do nothing with it's the third pole and he can't and he can't impersonate it he can't touch it what you're feeding on is not the mind of william branham nor the mind of any of these ministers it's the unfailing body word of the son of man i know this is a very unorthodox way but i'm i want to give you something because i know it'll stick to your mind but there as musicians making their way up here but jerry clower told a story one time about this i told you it'd stick with you i know my people we told this story about this this man that was going around the city and he was walking around the city and he
