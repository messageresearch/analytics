[44:29] appreciative of all that we have got to
[44:32] know and be a part of brother Bill's
[44:34] life throughout our history to think

[48:17] your Bibles this evening we'd like to
[48:18] look over in a few portions of scripture
[48:21] there over in the Gospel of John oh and
[48:25] down also to Romans chapter 4 and also
[48:28] to Ephesians chapter
[48:35] 2 John chapter
[48:53] 5 say Amen when you have it this
[49:01] evening
[49:03] amen amen all right you don't know where
[49:06] it's at it's the fourth gospel in the
[49:09] New Testament John chapter 5 after this
[49:12] there was a feast of the Jews and Jesus
[49:14] went up to Jerusalem now there is at
[49:17] Jerusalem by the Sheep Market a pool
[49:20] which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bea
[49:24] having five porches in these lay a great
[49:27] multitude of impotent folk of blind ha
[49:30] withered waiting for the moving of the
[49:32] water for an angel went down at a
[49:35] certain season into the pool and
[49:37] troubled the water whosoever then first
[49:40] after the troubling of the water stepped
[49:42] in was made whole of whatsoever disease
[49:46] he had and a certain man was there which
[49:49] had an infirmity 38 years and when Jesus
[49:53] saw him lie and knew that that he had
[49:55] been now a long time in that case he
[49:58] saith unto him wilt thou be made whole
[50:02] ain't that a wonderful
[50:03] question wilt thou be made whole I
[50:06] wonder tonight will thou be made whole
[50:09] and the impotent man answered him sir I
[50:12] have no man when the water is troubled
[50:16] to put me into the pool but while I am
[50:18] coming another steth down before me
[50:22] Jesus saith unto him rise up take up th
[50:25] bed and walk and immediately the man was
[50:28] made whole and took up his bed and
[50:31] walked on the same day was the Sabbath
[50:34] Romans chapter 4 and verse
[50:45] 16 therefore it is a faith that it might
[50:48] be by grace to the end the promise might
[50:52] be sure to all the seed not to that that
[50:55] only which is of the law but to that
[50:57] which to that also which is of the faith
[51:00] of Abraham who is the father of us all
[51:04] as it is written I have made thee a
[51:06] father of many nations before him whom
[51:09] he believed even God who quickeneth the
[51:11] dead and cth those things which be not
[51:15] as though they were who against hope
[51:17] believed in hope that he might become
[51:19] the father of many nations according to
[51:22] that which was spoken so shall thy seed
[51:25] be and being not weak in faith he
[51:27] considered not his own body now dead and
[51:30] when he was about a hundred years old
[51:32] neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb
[51:35] he staggered not at the promise of God
[51:37] through unbelief but was strong in faith
[51:39] giving glory to God and being fully
[51:42] persuaded that what he had promised he
[51:44] was able also to perform it also
[51:48] Ephesians chapter 2 and verse
[51:52] 4 Ephesians chapter 2 and verse4 and
[51:54] brother Brandon would say about Romans
[51:56] chapter 4 he said and whenever I'm down
[51:58] or whenever I'm blue he said I can
[52:00] always turn over to Romans chapter 4 and
[52:03] find real strength in it Ephesians
[52:05] chapter 2 and 4 but God who is rich in
[52:08] Mercy for his great love wherewith he
[52:11] loved us even when we were dead in sins
[52:15] hath quickened Us Together by Grace you
[52:18] are saved and hath raised us up together
[52:21] and made us sit together in Heavenly
[52:24] places in Christ Jesus amen may God
[52:28] bless his word you may be seated here in
[52:30] the presence of the Lord tonight I would
[52:33] like to speak to you on a thought on the
[52:36] Paradox the Paradox of the miraculous
[52:40] the Paradox of the miraculous and
[52:43] tonight I want to focus I want to focus
[52:45] on the force of God that is moving a
[52:48] people into the miraculous and it's it
[52:52] it is we recognize that it is the moving
[52:54] of the holy spirit that is moving a
[52:56] people to believe like never before and
[52:59] the Bible that that we as Christians we
[53:02] read every single day it is we recognize
[53:05] that the author of this word he wants to
[53:08] come and he wants to show forth his
[53:09] power and show forth his attributes in
[53:12] uh in our life and in every one of us he
[53:14] wants to demonstrate that there is no
[53:17] God like our God he isn't just wanting
[53:20] it to do it for for maybe just a an
[53:22] elementary believer but he's wanting to
[53:24] do it for every believer on the level
[53:26] that they are in God is wanting to
[53:28] demonstrate that he is the almighty God
[53:32] and I have found in my life that God
[53:34] loves to show forth his power he loves
[53:37] to display his power but God does not
[53:39] clown or he does not show off for
[53:41] anybody but he wants to declare that he
[53:44] is the almighty God and there's one
[53:46] thing that you cannot do with God you
[53:49] cannot force God and push God around to
[53:52] work a miracle in your life but what you
[53:54] can do is you can take God at his word
[53:56] and you can believe what he has said and
[53:58] by your faith and by your faith in God's
[54:01] word it will bring to pass all of the
[54:03] promises that God has laid there in the
[54:06] promises even if you have what you would
[54:08] say faith like a mustard seed maybe you
[54:10] would see that it's just real small
[54:13] Faith but God is not requiring a great
[54:15] big faith God just wants a common faith
[54:18] it a what he says when he is saying
[54:20] there about a mustard seed kind of faith
[54:22] it isn't how small the faith is it's
[54:25] that that faith will not mix with
[54:27] anything else because you cannot mix a
[54:29] mustard seed with anything else it won't
[54:31] mix with unbelief faith will not mix
[54:33] with doubt it won't it won't mix with
[54:35] any thing of the world but faith will
[54:37] fully rely itself upon the god that is a
[54:41] miracle worker who is a promisee keeper
[54:44] who is a light in the darkness who is
[54:46] who is our sustainer of our soul he is
[54:49] the lifter of our head he is the Prince
[54:51] of Peace he is the king of kings he is
[54:54] the Lord of lords he is the mighty
[54:56] conqueror he is he is the Prince of
[54:59] Peace he is My All In All he is the
[55:01] mighty conqueror he is my defense he is
[55:05] my buckler he is my strength on one hand
[55:08] he's a god that is a silent partner but
[55:11] on the other hand he's your lawyer he's
[55:13] your Banker he's your doctor he's your
[55:16] surgeon he's your everything if you
[55:18] allow him to be your everything and
[55:21] that's the thing about you and God is
[55:22] that you and God were born together to
[55:25] be and built together to be partners in
[55:28] the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost in This
[55:30] Hour you and God let's say it like this
[55:32] that you and God are Partners in the
[55:35] miraculous and that's what God is
[55:37] looking for in this hour a partner in
[55:39] the word of
[55:41] God brother Brandon would say he said
[55:43] sometimes you might think that you're a
[55:45] minority he said but God usually is in
[55:48] the minority but brother when he gets
[55:50] ready to move he shakes the majority
[55:53] with the minority because he's almighty
[55:55] God and you might feel like you're a
[55:57] nobody in the economy of God but God
[56:00] takes the minority and he takes the
[56:02] majority with the minority so it doesn't
[56:04] matter what your last name it is it
[56:06] doesn't matter what kind of background
[56:08] that you came from God is the kind of
[56:11] God that is looking for one person and
[56:13] that somebody to believe his word no
[56:16] matter what they come up against no
[56:18] matter what the obstacles that they face
[56:20] in life God is wanting somebody that
[56:22] believes when times get tough and when
[56:25] the rubber meets the road and when the
[56:26] when the trial gets hot God is wanting
[56:29] somebody that simply believes him and
[56:32] takes him at his
[56:33] word you see because difficulty is the
[56:37] very atmosphere of a miracle when you
[56:39] see difficulty I want you to recognize
[56:42] it like this from now on throughout all
[56:44] of your life to look at difficulty as
[56:47] the first stage of a
[56:49] miracle that when you begin to see
[56:51] troubles come and when you begin to see
[56:53] Trials come that you are first watching
[56:55] the first stage of a miracle begin to
[56:58] take place and if it's going to be a
[57:00] great miracle then the condition is not
[57:02] difficulty but it's impossibility but I
[57:05] have found about God that that is where
[57:07] God does his business very well is in
[57:10] the impossibilities of things of men
[57:12] because the Bible said that these things
[57:14] which are impossible with men are
[57:16] possible with God and Jesus would say
[57:19] over and over again for with God nothing
[57:22] is impossible so to think that tonight
[57:25] that no matter where you came from and
[57:26] no matter where you're going that the
[57:28] impossibilities of God are where God
[57:31] begins to produce exactly who he is all
[57:34] of God is Supernatural every being every
[57:37] little least little touch of God is the
[57:39] omnipotent power of almighty God and
[57:43] he's the same yesterday today and
[57:45] forever when you begin to look at the
[57:47] prophecy when Isaiah was standing there
[57:49] 800 years 800 years before Mary ever
[57:53] came upon the Earth he was under
[57:55] inspiration he wasn't brother random
[57:57] said he wasn't thinking about his
[57:59] intellectualism he didn't say he didn't
[58:01] say I wouldn't think he wasn't thinking
[58:03] about his intellectuals he said but wait
[58:05] a minute he said now wait a minute if
[58:07] I'd say that well you know the people
[58:08] would think that I'm insane he said see
[58:10] that's his intellectual he said there
[58:13] he's listening to Satan just like Eve
[58:15] did so you know that it doesn't matter
[58:18] what people see and it doesn't matter
[58:20] what people think about the consequences
[58:23] of your promises and the faith that you
[58:25] have in almighty God because Isaiah was
[58:28] simply a mouthpiece for almighty God he
[58:30] was simply saying what God put upon his
[58:32] lips he did not have a he did not have
[58:34] the ability to choose the words that he
[58:37] was speaking he was simply under the
[58:39] moving of the Holy Ghost and he spoke
[58:41] under inspiration even though it was
[58:44] against human reasoning he stood there
[58:46] and said a virgin is going to
[58:49] conceive and it took 800 years but in
[58:52] all the waiting God had seen her before
[58:55] Isaiah's prophecy had ever come out of
[58:58] Isaiah's mouth but you see God had a
[59:01] lady that he had forew before the
[59:04] foundational world that that little Mary
[59:06] was going to be a incubator that she was
[59:09] going to be the very bedding ground
[59:11] where Jesus would come from you see God
[59:14] had found a seed God had a seed but he
[59:16] found a bidding ground that he could
[59:18] drop the very spoken word into the womb
[59:20] of Mary and produced a very miracle that
[59:24] would trans ired to be one of the
[59:25] greatest Miracles that's ever been told
[59:27] throughout all the Earth without this
[59:29] miracle there is no
[59:32] Miracle Hallelujah without the miracle
[59:35] of Mary meeting meeting an angel and
[59:37] telling her that she's going to conceive
[59:40] and she's going to bring forth a child
[59:42] and she's going to name him Jesus let me
[59:44] tell you this is one of the greatest
[59:47] Miracles that there ever is and ever
[59:49] will be but it's one of the most
[59:51] questioned Miracles that there is in all
[59:53] the Bible there's a lot of people say
[59:55] that she met a German or a Roman soldier
[59:57] even Baptist theologians say that she
[1:00:00] slept with a Roman soldier to think it's
[1:00:03] coming for people that believe in Bible
[1:00:05] theory that say that she slept with a
[1:00:08] with a Roman soldier but God did not do
[1:00:11] anything God didn't do anything sexually
[1:00:13] wrong he simply spoke the word and she
[1:00:17] believed him at his word and I know it's
[1:00:19] a paradox to you that a virgin can can
[1:00:22] conceive at 16 years old and bring for
[1:00:25] the child and that child would save the
[1:00:28] whole world but there is another people
[1:00:31] in the land another virgin under their
[1:00:34] messenger who will be the final
[1:00:37] voice under their messenger I know it's
[1:00:40] a paradox but this woman is not
[1:00:42] manhandled this woman knows who she is
[1:00:45] she's not been touched by man she's not
[1:00:47] been touched by denominationalism she's
[1:00:50] been touched only by the hands of
[1:00:53] Jehovah and when you've only been
[1:00:55] touched by the hands of Jehovah there is
[1:00:58] a
[1:01:00] miracle there's a miracle in the room
[1:01:03] when Jesus is the only one touching
[1:01:07] you well glory be to God you don't need
[1:01:11] a doctor to touch you for the miracle to
[1:01:13] happen you don't need a lawyer to touch
[1:01:15] your situation or your case or to take
[1:01:17] your case but let Jehovah take your case
[1:01:20] let Jehovah walk into your hospital
[1:01:23] room
[1:01:26] woo well
[1:01:28] Glory
[1:01:30] Hallelujah
[1:01:31] Hallelujah now brother maram would say
[1:01:33] it he would preach it over and over
[1:01:35] again on a paradox he would tell us that
[1:01:38] he would draw from the thought there he
[1:01:41] said it's a paradox it means that
[1:01:44] something that's incredible but it's
[1:01:48] true it's a paradox it's incredible but
[1:01:52] it's true again he would say he said but
[1:01:54] the one who can bring a paradox is with
[1:01:58] us the god The God Who all of his works
[1:02:01] is a paradox it's past understanding
[1:02:04] it's incredible but it's true he can
[1:02:07] bring a paradox again he would say he
[1:02:10] said but if he will identify himself sir
[1:02:13] we would see Jesus and that's the only
[1:02:15] way that you can impersonate that cuz
[1:02:18] that's a miracle it's a paradox he said
[1:02:21] brother Andrew what are you preaching
[1:02:22] this why are you preaching this right
[1:02:25] now why are you preaching this right now
[1:02:27] don't you recognize where we are we're
[1:02:30] in need of a
[1:02:32] miracle well I ain't just talking about
[1:02:34] brother Ron situation and I ain't
[1:02:36] talking about maybe the prayer request
[1:02:37] situation but do you recognize that
[1:02:40] every one of us are here are in need of
[1:02:42] a miracle because without a miracle
[1:02:46] you're going by the way of the Grave
[1:02:47] Wire by the same way that brother bill
[1:02:49] went but you're are in need of a body
[1:02:53] change and I know it's a paradox but
[1:02:56] you're in you're right in line for
[1:03:00] it he said you can't impersonate that
[1:03:03] cuz that's a miracle it's a paradox it
[1:03:06] certainly is a paradox a paradox is a
[1:03:09] miracle something that cannot be
[1:03:12] explained it's a paradox again he would
[1:03:15] say now a miracle would be the same
[1:03:17] thing for a miracle cannot be explained
[1:03:19] a miracle is something that happens and
[1:03:22] you cannot explain it that makes it a
[1:03:24] paradox it's incredible but yet it's
[1:03:28] truth he said now people today he said a
[1:03:31] lot of modernists believe that the days
[1:03:33] of Miracles has passed he said they
[1:03:35] don't believe that there is such a thing
[1:03:38] as a miracle he said but yet I believe
[1:03:41] that the world is full of Miracles I
[1:03:43] believe the Paradox is constantly again
[1:03:47] he would say for instance I believe that
[1:03:49] every Born Again member of the body of
[1:03:52] Christ is a paradox in themselves I read
[1:03:56] a sto a statement today that brother
[1:03:57] brandom said he said if you're a
[1:03:59] Christian if you're a Believer you're a
[1:04:01] miracle he said that's a miracle in
[1:04:04] itself is to be a believer when we're
[1:04:06] living in an hour when Jesus would say
[1:04:09] he said when the son of man comes again
[1:04:11] will he find Faith but I say that God
[1:04:14] has found favor in a little woman down
[1:04:16] here that is highly
[1:04:19] favored I know it's beyond your your
[1:04:22] human comprehension that you could bring
[1:04:24] forth a child and that a child could be
[1:04:27] a savior of the whole world I know it's
[1:04:29] beyond your human comprehension that you
[1:04:31] can produce a same works that Jesus
[1:04:34] produced I know it's beyond your beyond
[1:04:36] your comprehension that you're going to
[1:04:38] take a body change but if a little old
[1:04:40] woman could stand out there when her boy
[1:04:43] was dying with a social disease and she
[1:04:45] said where be my Elijah at and she had
[1:04:48] the kind of faith that could land a 747
[1:04:52] plane what was it it was was that
[1:04:54] woman's faith that caused the storm what
[1:04:57] about it today if it's a paradox then
[1:04:59] it's a paradox now that somebody can
[1:05:04] believe what was it it was showing that
[1:05:08] God was working on both ends when
[1:05:10] William brandham started taking a walk
[1:05:12] and there was a woman waiting at the
[1:05:15] gate it's a sign tonight that God is
[1:05:18] working on both ends you're in need of a
[1:05:20] miracle and God's got a preacher
[1:05:23] preaching that God is still the
[1:05:26] [Applause]
[1:05:28] God where be my Elijah at she couldn't
[1:05:32] ask that in the 1800s but when she was
[1:05:34] standing there in the 1940s she had
[1:05:37] every right to say where be my Elijah
[1:05:42] at Hallelujah and Elijah come walking by
[1:05:46] our
[1:05:49] way she looked at him said
[1:05:52] Barson how'd you know I a Parson I've
[1:05:55] been up early this morning talking to
[1:05:58] Jesus where's your briefcase at Parson
[1:06:02] it showed that she had seen him in a
[1:06:04] vision the Lord done show me that she
[1:06:07] was coming down here now if that woman
[1:06:09] was in that condition and could
[1:06:11] accumulate that kind of Faith what about
[1:06:13] you tonight the seals are open to you
[1:06:16] that book has been open under you you're
[1:06:18] a third pole kind of
[1:06:22] people so brother Andrew I don't know if
[1:06:24] I can have that kind of faith I believe
[1:06:25] that I can give you my kind of
[1:06:28] faith I believe for you when you do not
[1:06:31] believe brother Matthew I believe for
[1:06:33] you when you when you you feel like God
[1:06:35] is you I got that kind of Faith you said
[1:06:38] well how in the world can you can you
[1:06:40] say that you can give us your faith when
[1:06:41] you start reading over in Acts chapter 3
[1:06:44] and Peter and John start walking down
[1:06:46] there by the beautiful gate that God did
[1:06:48] not have that kind of Faith but when
[1:06:50] Peter said such as I have give I Thee in
[1:06:52] the name of Jesus Christ so maybe you
[1:06:54] sit and say that I don't have that kind
[1:06:56] of Faith but such as I have give I Thee
[1:06:59] in the name of Jesus Christ so welcome
[1:07:01] to your new kind of
[1:07:03] [Applause]
[1:07:05] Faith Hallelujah my kind of faith says
[1:07:08] it's time for a body change my kind of
[1:07:11] Faith said cancer is defeated my kind of
[1:07:13] Faith said that there's a people that is
[1:07:15] birthed to take a
[1:07:17] change welcome to the faith of almighty
[1:07:22] God it's a Paradox that you can believe
[1:07:25] when things are
[1:07:28] unbelievable but the miracle is in the
[1:07:33] [Applause]
[1:07:37] room
[1:07:39] woo in all and in all ages God had men
[1:07:44] he had Ministry in every age because God
[1:07:46] is
[1:07:48] Supernatural and when God comes on the
[1:07:50] scene Supernatural takes place for he is
[1:07:55] Supernatural and his people always look
[1:07:57] for him in the Supernatural because when
[1:08:00] they become sons of God they become the
[1:08:03] very nature of God and in that they pick
[1:08:06] up that believing
[1:08:09] himy so when you were born again you
[1:08:12] picked that
[1:08:13] up you didn't even know that you had
[1:08:16] that kind of Faith but when you got a
[1:08:18] new change when you got a new heart when
[1:08:20] you took off the old coat and you put on
[1:08:22] the new you didn't know what you was
[1:08:24] doing but you was picking up that kind
[1:08:25] of
[1:08:27] Faith well glory be to
[1:08:31] God come on somebody this ain't picking
[1:08:33] up your groceries this ain't picking up
[1:08:35] your laundry this ain't picking up your
[1:08:37] kids from school this is picking up
[1:08:39] Jesus and when you pick up Jesus you
[1:08:42] better get ready for a
[1:08:45] miracle come on somebody you can pull
[1:08:48] into the car line down here at Elon
[1:08:50] middle school and your kid may not come
[1:08:52] out but when you go to pick up up Jesus
[1:08:54] Jesus will always be there he's right on
[1:08:57] time he was on time for Lazarus he was
[1:09:00] on time for the Hebrew
[1:09:07] children it's a
[1:09:09] paradox it's a paradox of a little bitty
[1:09:11] boy could pack his lunch to school and
[1:09:14] could feed
[1:09:15] 5,000 but it
[1:09:17] happened brother bham said brother bam
[1:09:20] said to them critics in that day he said
[1:09:21] they said well ain't no wonder it could
[1:09:23] feed 5,000 loes was bigger
[1:09:26] then I'd hate to carry that sucker to
[1:09:31] work that thing be that thing be the
[1:09:34] longest as long as 200 yards I'm going
[1:09:37] to school
[1:09:39] mama I got Five Loaves with me
[1:09:42] today and two little fishies he's a big
[1:09:45] fish back
[1:09:46] in it's a paradox I tell you if you got
[1:09:50] that kind of Faith you got more faith
[1:09:52] than I got
[1:09:55] but
[1:09:56] no help me Lord again he would say
[1:10:00] everywhere God moves anytime Through the
[1:10:02] Bible you'll see healing and miracles
[1:10:05] and signs and wonders he leaves a track
[1:10:08] behind him of the
[1:10:10] supernatural wo well I'm following Jesus
[1:10:13] all the way he's leaving behind him the
[1:10:17] track of the supernatural he said I
[1:10:20] don't care what theologians say when the
[1:10:23] Bible is WR he said when God moves the
[1:10:25] world
[1:10:26] shakes I read it just before I come out
[1:10:29] he said brother BR said he said it's in
[1:10:31] those hours of great trials and great
[1:10:33] stresses just like when the three Hebrew
[1:10:35] children they were getting ready to be
[1:10:37] thrown into the
[1:10:38] fire he's brother bom said but when he
[1:10:41] moves he moves and you may not be
[1:10:44] sitting here in a fiery furnace but
[1:10:46] maybe you're in the trial of your life
[1:10:49] but I'll say this when God moves he
[1:10:51] moves maybe I ain't speaking to anybody
[1:10:54] here in the building maybe I'm just
[1:10:56] talking to somebody up there on the
[1:10:58] stream I'm preaching to these angels
[1:11:00] down here but somebody up there is
[1:11:02] needing but let me bring news to you
[1:11:05] when he
[1:11:08] moves when he moved upon the waters and
[1:11:11] he said let there be light and there was
[1:11:13] light when he moves he moves when he
[1:11:15] moved through the three h children he
[1:11:21] moved I was listening to a sermon today
[1:11:24] from 1957 in
[1:11:26] Saskatoon brother brandham is preaching
[1:11:28] their love and brother brandham he's
[1:11:30] he's having a prayer line it goes on for
[1:11:31] about an hour and brother random is
[1:11:33] dealing with a he's dealing with a de
[1:11:35] mute girl and he's trying to he's trying
[1:11:38] to speak to her and he's trying to talk
[1:11:39] to her and he and he he's trying to
[1:11:41] accumulate her he's trying to get her to
[1:11:43] believe
[1:11:44] and and now brother man said he said now
[1:11:47] he starts talking about this he said now
[1:11:49] she won't know what to do with her
[1:11:51] healing he said but her daddy will inst
[1:11:53] instructor in
[1:11:54] it I'd say there's some mamas and
[1:11:56] daddies that's still willing to instruct
[1:11:58] their children in the Bible kind of
[1:12:02] Faith because she'd never heard before
[1:12:05] she'd never spoke before but there was
[1:12:08] going to come healing to her life but
[1:12:10] brother M said brother M while he's
[1:12:12] telling this you can hear him sit there
[1:12:14] and he said now he said just like Gesa
[1:12:16] went up there for Elijah and he climbed
[1:12:19] that hill and he come back down there
[1:12:22] saying that I only only see the size of
[1:12:25] the hand of a man up there what was it
[1:12:28] when Elijah heard that he said I hear
[1:12:31] the abundance of rain are coming and
[1:12:33] brother bam said may this be just a
[1:12:36] little bit of sign to this little girl
[1:12:38] and when brother brandham says that
[1:12:41] there's another lady that brother
[1:12:42] brandham has already prayed for in the
[1:12:45] prayer line and she's down there nodding
[1:12:47] her head she was death and couldn't hear
[1:12:50] but while brother Brandon is saying that
[1:12:52] said I see the hand of a man's the cloud
[1:12:54] the size of a man's hand when that woman
[1:12:57] heard brother brandom talking about that
[1:12:59] she received her healing when she'd been
[1:13:01] prayed for minutes or maybe 20 minutes
[1:13:04] before but she's down there nodding
[1:13:07] about
[1:13:07] it but it what was it a sign it was a
[1:13:11] sign that there was an abundance of rain
[1:13:12] that was coming and brother bandam
[1:13:14] starts praying for that little girl she
[1:13:16] can't hear and she can't speak but when
[1:13:19] brother brandham gets done speaking with
[1:13:21] her he starts clapping her hands he
[1:13:23] starts clapping his hands he said she
[1:13:26] can
[1:13:28] hear what are you talking about brother
[1:13:31] anro
[1:13:33] brother you walked into the building
[1:13:36] tonight you had Faith to sit down here
[1:13:39] tonight I would receive that as the size
[1:13:43] of a hand of a man but let there be an
[1:13:46] announcement from heaven in Full Gospel
[1:13:48] Lighthouse I hear the sound of the
[1:13:51] abundance of rain that is coming
[1:13:54] I know it's a paradox for you to believe
[1:13:56] that these things are possible I know
[1:13:59] it's a paradox for you to believe that
[1:14:01] Isaiah would say that there's going to
[1:14:03] be that you're going to be there and
[1:14:04] your Offspring is going to be there with
[1:14:06] them I know it's a I know it's a burden
[1:14:09] on you sister Sean but I don't know how
[1:14:11] to explain it any other way than the
[1:14:13] Bible said that you'll be there and your
[1:14:16] Offspring will be there with you I can't
[1:14:19] explain it myself but I believe
[1:14:22] it I can't explain why he take a
[1:14:24] hillbilly out of pilot Virginia and make
[1:14:27] him a preacher like he made
[1:14:29] him send him all across the world become
[1:14:33] a legend a legend of Faith put him in a
[1:14:36] fire and he came out preaching knock him
[1:14:38] off a roof and he got up
[1:14:42] preaching come on
[1:14:44] somebody it's a paradox but it's
[1:14:51] true Hallelujah
[1:14:53] [Applause]
[1:14:55] Hallelujah call me crazy but we're 50
[1:14:58] years into this Jubilee and it started
[1:15:00] brother in brother Bill's hle in his
[1:15:03] basement but we ain't in the basement no
[1:15:05] more
[1:15:07] honey we're up here on the hill and it's
[1:15:10] a sign to all the world that there is a
[1:15:13] lighthouse that's still preaching the
[1:15:15] Full
[1:15:16] Gospel it's been 50 years since we
[1:15:18] started and it started in a basement but
[1:15:21] 50 years later we're still sounding Out
[1:15:24] the same trumpet it's
[1:15:28] freedom I hear the sound of the
[1:15:31] abundance of rain
[1:15:34] coming 50 years we ain't slaves to it no
[1:15:43] more brother maram said in the second
[1:15:45] seal he said he said when a man turns
[1:15:49] down that
[1:15:50] Jubilee He said Satan marks him
[1:15:53] by deafening his ears to the word of
[1:15:56] God he said but God brother Rand said
[1:15:59] but God marks his children by
[1:16:01] vindicating the word through them don't
[1:16:04] you realize that you're not marked like
[1:16:06] Satan would Mark you but you're marked
[1:16:09] by almighty God what am I saying to you
[1:16:12] I'm saying that Randall Griffith is
[1:16:14] marked by almighty God and he's
[1:16:16] vindicating the promises of God through
[1:16:22] him
[1:16:24] hallelujah
[1:16:26] hallelujah what am I saying to you
[1:16:28] you're not marked by Satan you're Mark
[1:16:31] by the Jubilee
[1:16:36] trumpet
[1:16:38] hallelujah it's a paradox it's a paradox
[1:16:41] that people are fellowshipping with him
[1:16:43] by the hearing of the word and right
[1:16:45] here people are overcoming right here in
[1:16:48] Satan's Eden in the midst of perversion
[1:16:51] in the midst of utter chaos and they're
[1:16:53] living true to almighty God and his
[1:16:55] bride is dressing herself with a spoken
[1:16:58] word can I say this she's a rapsure
[1:17:01] ready lady and the wagon wheels of
[1:17:03] Prophecy are rolling as she's dressing
[1:17:06] herself in the robe of Malachi Four's
[1:17:10] word now notice what brother Brandon
[1:17:12] says here in the Rapture he said but to
[1:17:15] the TRU to the church the bride he said
[1:17:17] the Rapture is a revelation to her it's
[1:17:21] revealed to her that the Revelation the
[1:17:24] true bride of Christ will be waiting for
[1:17:26] the revelation of that Rapture he said
[1:17:29] now it is a revelation he said for the
[1:17:31] Revelation is a faith you cannot have a
[1:17:35] revelation without it being faith faith
[1:17:38] is a revelation because it's something
[1:17:41] that's revealed to you so what does this
[1:17:45] body have she has a rapturing kind of
[1:17:48] faith and I'll say it like this is that
[1:17:51] your faith has been a identified by
[1:17:54] Christ himself just like when George J
[1:17:57] Lacy was standing there in 1950 and
[1:18:01] brother Brandon would tell this over and
[1:18:03] over and over again he would stand there
[1:18:06] and George J Lacy would say now look I
[1:18:09] was a doubter
[1:18:11] myself he said I thought it was all
[1:18:13] psychology myself he said but I can only
[1:18:17] say this is that that light struck that
[1:18:20] lens and it is the only super natural
[1:18:23] being that has ever been
[1:18:25] photographed what was it the head of the
[1:18:29] FBI was a denying that the PF fire has
[1:18:33] made its return to the body of Jesus
[1:18:35] Christ and that is identifying that her
[1:18:39] faith is identified in the
[1:18:42] body now brother R said now watch it he
[1:18:45] said watch The Works of it among you he
[1:18:47] said it proves the same Jesus that once
[1:18:50] lived in Palestine is the same spirit
[1:18:52] that was upon him has come through a
[1:18:55] body until it's come back to the
[1:18:57] headship again which he's coming soon to
[1:19:00] claim the body amen the head's coming to
[1:19:04] the body so what is it saying Brothers
[1:19:06] BR saying to us is that the faith of the
[1:19:09] headship has been identified in the
[1:19:13] body what was it that Pillar of Fire was
[1:19:16] an
[1:19:18] identification that that was Israel's
[1:19:20] leader right there and what is that sign
[1:19:23] signed to us every single time you see
[1:19:25] that Pillar of
[1:19:27] Fire and you look at that picture and
[1:19:30] you identified as the same yesterday
[1:19:32] today and forever what is it you're
[1:19:34] identifying that that's our leadership
[1:19:36] up there let me say this to you there's
[1:19:38] too many times that people get their
[1:19:40] picture or get their eyes on the picture
[1:19:42] and get their eyes on the wrong one in
[1:19:44] the picture but that is simply
[1:19:45] Revelations chapter 101 over Revelations
[1:19:48] Chap 10:7 and what is it it was
[1:19:51] identifying that but that is our
[1:19:53] leadership right there and he is not
[1:19:56] leading you to doubt he's not leading
[1:19:58] you to fear he's not leading you to
[1:20:00] anxiety he's not leading you to pain
[1:20:03] he's not leading you to Trouble Is there
[1:20:05] anybody wanting me to preach to him
[1:20:06] tonight he's not leading you to trouble
[1:20:09] he's leading you on a way out of
[1:20:15] here just like it was revealed to
[1:20:17] Abraham that he was going to bring forth
[1:20:19] a child it has been revealed to this
[1:20:23] God the Rapture ain't for another age it
[1:20:27] ain't for another
[1:20:30] ler this lamb these broken seals this
[1:20:34] broken body is a sign that this is her
[1:20:37] token out of here let me say this to you
[1:20:40] like this she has a right to stay in the
[1:20:42] house she has a right to stay in the
[1:20:44] house and not taste
[1:20:46] death she has a right to stay in the
[1:20:48] house and her firstborn not die she has
[1:20:51] a right to stay in the house and worship
[1:20:53] God in the way that she wants to and not
[1:20:56] taste death she has a right to put her
[1:20:58] shoes on her feet and not taste death
[1:21:00] she has a right to keep her staff in her
[1:21:01] hand and not taste death she has a right
[1:21:04] because the blood has been applied and
[1:21:06] it's over the heart's door she's got
[1:21:09] every right to worship God in spirit and
[1:21:12] in truth and I know it might be a
[1:21:14] paradox to you but the token has been
[1:21:17] applied and the Third Exodus is at hand
[1:21:21] I know it's a paradox to you that Elijah
[1:21:23] walked across the Jordan River smoted it
[1:21:26] and went up in a fiery Char a fiery
[1:21:29] charity I know it's a paradox to you
[1:21:31] that it's recorded that that's a second
[1:21:33] Rapture that's recorded in the Bible but
[1:21:36] I want you to know that those chariots
[1:21:38] that were hanging on those bushes are
[1:21:41] there waiting for you so that you can be
[1:21:43] the fourth recorded Rapture in the
[1:21:47] Bible I know it's a I know it's a
[1:21:49] paradox that Enoch was the seventh from
[1:21:52] Adam and he walked with God and he was
[1:21:55] not and I know it's a paradox to you
[1:21:57] that you're the seventh from the second
[1:21:59] Adam I know it's a paradox to you but
[1:22:01] you're walking and just keep on walking
[1:22:04] and one of these moments between the
[1:22:06] hours of 6 and
[1:22:08] 9 it ain't got to be 6 and N over here
[1:22:12] in the United States it could be 6 and N
[1:22:14] in Zimbabwe or over in Portland over in
[1:22:17] over over in a different country it
[1:22:20] could be six and nine there
[1:22:23] but I know that I know that I know that
[1:22:26] William brandham said that it would be
[1:22:28] in the Third Watch of the
[1:22:30] day and it's been perally revealed to us
[1:22:34] that we are that
[1:22:37] body come on somebody you're the you're
[1:22:39] the seventh from the second Adam and
[1:22:41] you're a type you're a
[1:22:44] type you're a type of Enoch you're the
[1:22:47] anot type to
[1:22:48] him what was he simply doing he was
[1:22:51] playing out the type of
[1:22:54] you and every demon out of hell is
[1:22:58] trying to stop the program of allmighty
[1:23:00] God you watch
[1:23:04] it you watch it we are seeing every
[1:23:07] demon out of the pit of Hell attack the
[1:23:09] ministry like never
[1:23:11] before every demon out of hell it's
[1:23:13] attacking the aity across the body of
[1:23:15] Jesus Christ like never
[1:23:18] before like never before every demon out
[1:23:21] of hell is attacking the moving of the
[1:23:23] Holy Ghost and the preaching of the
[1:23:25] gospel and speaking in tongues and
[1:23:27] worshiping God in the way in the way
[1:23:30] that God ordained us to worship him but
[1:23:33] I want to say it to you like this it's a
[1:23:34] God
[1:23:36] thing it's a God thing because the
[1:23:39] stronger that they think they fight
[1:23:40] against us the stronger we get it's a
[1:23:43] God
[1:23:44] thing it's a God thing keep hit me tell
[1:23:48] me not to worship and I'll still be here
[1:23:50] worshiping tell me not to preach and
[1:23:53] I'll still be here preaching what is it
[1:23:55] it's a God
[1:24:00] thing come on every demon in Hell's got
[1:24:03] his gun trained against Israel right now
[1:24:06] but there's a counterpart there's a
[1:24:08] spiritual Israel that's not backing off
[1:24:10] of any of her bloodbound promises she's
[1:24:12] preaching she's lining her War she's
[1:24:14] lining her weapons of warfare up and
[1:24:17] she's sending out the
[1:24:21] bombs
[1:24:27] notice notice you ain't never going to
[1:24:29] put this
[1:24:31] out you can be against us all you want
[1:24:34] to but you'll never put this out you can
[1:24:37] try to stop us but you'll never put this
[1:24:39] out you can try to preach against us but
[1:24:41] you'll never put this out come on
[1:24:44] somebody Homer phaser did not die in
[1:24:46] vain believeing that the message is
[1:24:48] Right Bill hle did not die in vain
[1:24:50] believeing that the message is right you
[1:24:52] can't put this
[1:24:56] out well I'm going to need a quote for
[1:24:58] it brother Andrew I'm glad you asked me
[1:25:02] he said in the days of Pentecostals in
[1:25:04] the restoring back of the gifts he said
[1:25:06] the restoration of the gifts speaking in
[1:25:07] tongues and casting out devils and the
[1:25:09] gifts he said why it's testified he said
[1:25:12] there was no joke about it people said
[1:25:14] when it was first raised he said I read
[1:25:16] the books on the history of the
[1:25:17] Pentecost and they said it can't last
[1:25:19] long it'll burn down it's still burning
[1:25:22] why is because you can never put it out
[1:25:25] God said it would be there it it's that
[1:25:28] portion of the word and no more could
[1:25:30] you put that out and then when the bride
[1:25:32] is being called out how you going to put
[1:25:34] it
[1:25:36] out how you going to put it out what is
[1:25:39] this this is the calling out of the
[1:25:44] bride and when the bride's being called
[1:25:46] out how you going to put it out he said
[1:25:48] it's a revelation of the manifestation
[1:25:50] of the word made true and we living in
[1:25:53] that day praise be to God it is the
[1:25:56] revelation of the mystery himself he
[1:25:59] said but the Rapture is only he said the
[1:26:02] Rapture that we're talking about is
[1:26:05] only for the
[1:26:09] bride you might be able to put it out
[1:26:12] with the Church of Christ message people
[1:26:14] but you will not put it out with a
[1:26:17] bride come on somebody you might put it
[1:26:19] out with the Methodist message Believers
[1:26:21] or the bap this message believer us but
[1:26:23] you won't put it out with a
[1:26:25] bride come on somebody I'm talking to
[1:26:28] you about a paradox that you can believe
[1:26:31] that you can't stop this Holy Ghost
[1:26:33] Fire come on somebody it's more than a
[1:26:36] song but it's fire shut up in my bones

[1:28:21] out
[1:28:22] God elected me God called me God
[1:28:25] ordained me I'm born for this message
[1:28:28] I'm identified for the
[1:28:30] [Applause]
[1:28:42] Rapture I was thinking today when I was
[1:28:44] in my
[1:28:46] study we to think about when Joshua was
[1:28:50] under his Commission
[1:28:55] I don't know the Bible doesn't the Bible
[1:28:58] doesn't give us indicators on this but I
[1:29:00] just begin to imagine this me just give
[1:29:03] me a little bit of Liberty
[1:29:05] here but I can imagine as Moses wasn't
[1:29:09] granted to go over on the other
[1:29:12] side but when Joshua steps into his
[1:29:16] role maybe the Lord allowed Moses just a
[1:29:20] little bit of a space of time to be able
[1:29:22] to look over the banisters because you
[1:29:25] remember the Angels packed Moses
[1:29:27] home he didn't die they packed him home
[1:29:30] because he was found 2,000 years 4,000
[1:29:32] years later up there on Mount
[1:29:34] Transfiguration but I could imagine if
[1:29:37] Moses is able to look beyond the
[1:29:41] banisters and look over there and see
[1:29:44] Joshua under his commission oh
[1:29:48] yeah I know I know what it's like with
[1:29:51] my when my girls do something
[1:29:55] spectacular I know how it makes me
[1:29:58] feel you imagine as a daddy how it makes
[1:30:01] you feel as a parent how it makes you
[1:30:03] feel but you imagine how Moses is just
[1:30:08] just give me a little bit here imagine
[1:30:11] as Moses is he's on that side and he's
[1:30:13] looking down there that's my
[1:30:17] boy he's preaching what I
[1:30:20] preached he's living out what I what I
[1:30:23] what I said was going to happen when I
[1:30:25] was up there on that mountain and I met
[1:30:26] that Burning
[1:30:28] Bush when I met that burning bush and he
[1:30:30] told me that we was going to come back
[1:30:31] to this mountain and now Joshua is under
[1:30:34] his
[1:30:35] commission he's there he's operating
[1:30:37] under my authority what was he operating
[1:30:39] under he was operating under the
[1:30:41] authority of a prophet you imagine how
[1:30:44] Moses sitting there when when Joshua
[1:30:46] walks out there in Joshua chapter 3
[1:30:49] Joshua chapter 4 Joshua chapter 5 Joshua
[1:30:52] chapter 6 he goes out there and walks
[1:30:55] across Jordan he walks into Jericho and
[1:30:57] tears it down he goes into Joshua
[1:31:01] 10 what is Joshua grabbing a hold of in
[1:31:05] Joshua chapter 10 he is simply aligning
[1:31:09] himself with the message of
[1:31:15] Moses Now give me a little bit of
[1:31:18] Liberty but could you imagine if William
[1:31:20] Brandon's able to look over
[1:31:22] over the banister of time and able to
[1:31:24] look out across a body and say they're
[1:31:26] living out what I preached they're being
[1:31:30] exactly what I saw in a
[1:31:33] vision and Joshua was standing there in
[1:31:36] Joshua chapter 10 and his enemies is
[1:31:38] coming against him and he's running out
[1:31:40] of time and he simply takes the word of
[1:31:44] Moses and he puts Deuteronomy 28 in
[1:31:47] effect and he stops the son because
[1:31:50] you'll never be able to curse a son of
[1:31:52] almighty God when he's blessed by
[1:31:54] almighty
[1:31:57] God
[1:31:59] hallelujah that thing keeps cutting out
[1:32:01] on me I'm sorry
[1:32:03] Brothers but Joshua was simply under his
[1:32:07] commission he was simply sitting there
[1:32:10] under the authority of a prophet
[1:32:12] preaching and living out what a prophet
[1:32:14] said what was he doing he was under the
[1:32:16] commission he was under his
[1:32:20] commission and whenn josua got over
[1:32:22] there when he was running out of time
[1:32:24] when he was running out of time and he
[1:32:26] simply put him in a cave he put him in
[1:32:28] that cave and he put them five Kings in
[1:32:30] there and he went back there after he
[1:32:33] had defeated their armies he brought
[1:32:35] them five Kings
[1:32:36] out notice what he does Joshua invites
[1:32:41] the captains of the
[1:32:43] army to come under the same Authority
[1:32:46] that he was
[1:32:47] under do like I'm doing do like I'm
[1:32:52] doing you put your foot on their neck
[1:32:55] what does William Brenham say you say
[1:32:57] what the tape says what are we operating
[1:32:59] under we are operating under the
[1:33:01] ministry of Malachi 4 you have the
[1:33:04] authority of a prophet that is backing
[1:33:06] you up so come on somebody you're not
[1:33:09] just under an Acts 2 anointing of the
[1:33:11] pouring out of the Holy Spirit you're
[1:33:13] under a Revelations 10 anointing the
[1:33:16] mighty Angel Hallelujah is standing here
[1:33:20] and he's inviting you to put your foot
[1:33:22] upon the neck of your
[1:33:24] enemy what are you going to do about it
[1:33:27] what are you going to do about your pain
[1:33:29] what are you going to do about your
[1:33:30] troubles what are you going to do about
[1:33:31] it I say it's time you put your foot on
[1:33:35] that line devil and try it's high time
[1:33:38] that you stomp his mouth out stop him
[1:33:41] from speaking if he says you're a liar
[1:33:43] if he says you're not good enough put
[1:33:45] your foot on his
[1:33:49] neck say well I don't got got that kind
[1:33:51] of faith brother BR said I'd never
[1:33:53] confess
[1:33:56] that come on somebody the devil can put
[1:33:59] it in your mind and the devil can make
[1:34:00] you think about looking at the wrong
[1:34:02] things but don't you ever listen to him
[1:34:04] don't you confess his thoughts now
[1:34:07] notice what brother ROM said he said
[1:34:08] when God moves in a supernatural your
[1:34:10] heart will hunger right to it he said
[1:34:14] you won't get off on one side and say
[1:34:15] well it's mental telepathy a devil beels
[1:34:18] above I don't believe that my church
[1:34:19] don't teach that you'll say God be
[1:34:22] praised
[1:34:23] forever you're not going to sit there
[1:34:25] and think that's for days gone by you're
[1:34:28] filled with the Holy Ghost you can only
[1:34:30] think his thoughts but you see how you
[1:34:33] receive the supernatural it determines
[1:34:37] your
[1:34:38] reward what you think about this service
[1:34:41] tonight will determine your reward after
[1:34:43] tonight is that right my brother Brandon
[1:34:46] was dealing with a patient one time he's
[1:34:47] sitting there and he's dealing with a
[1:34:48] lady and he start he starts talking to
[1:34:50] her he said now he said if I would just
[1:34:52] simply lay my hands upon her and I would
[1:34:55] pray the prayer of faith over her and I
[1:34:57] could send her on her way and just say
[1:34:59] now go on believing he said now he said
[1:35:02] if I did that he said I would be in
[1:35:03] accordance to the Bible he said but if
[1:35:05] God would stand here and say something
[1:35:08] to her about her past that I don't know
[1:35:11] anything of she would have to identify
[1:35:14] that that is a supernatural power that
[1:35:16] it's coming from a resource
[1:35:19] there he said now however she thinks
[1:35:22] about that whether she thinks that it's
[1:35:24] a devil or she thinks it's a mental
[1:35:26] telepathy he said that's how she'll be
[1:35:29] rewarded so how you think about what the
[1:35:33] Supernatural is saying to you is what
[1:35:35] you're going to
[1:35:39] witness all right all right now we're
[1:35:41] getting somewhere but what you are
[1:35:43] witnessing right here right now is none
[1:35:46] other than the moving of the Holy Spirit
[1:35:49] when we see our young girls on fire like
[1:35:51] never before and rising up and living
[1:35:54] out the message their hearts being
[1:35:56] transformed their lives and their
[1:35:58] healings being made manifest in their
[1:36:01] lives relationships being restored young
[1:36:04] boys becoming real men and young women
[1:36:07] becoming Real Women of
[1:36:09] Faith when we see prodal returning when
[1:36:12] we see families being restored when see
[1:36:15] when we see the miracle of the present
[1:36:17] everyday hour becoming made manifest in
[1:36:20] our hour we would say this is none other
[1:36:23] than the moving of the Holy
[1:36:26] Ghost brother brandom said in the
[1:36:28] invisible Union of the Bride he said
[1:36:30] some of you people really believe
[1:36:32] this he said to be the truth he said
[1:36:34] we're entering into another age he said
[1:36:37] we're entering into a Rapture age you
[1:36:40] know the church can't go in its
[1:36:41] condition it can't get any better he
[1:36:43] said but it must get worse he said how
[1:36:45] many people knows that amen say
[1:36:48] amen he said it's got to get worse and
[1:36:51] it can't go like this he said it's got
[1:36:53] to be something and it's moving right
[1:36:55] now friend it's on he said the move is
[1:36:58] on for the bride that's the truth that's
[1:37:02] thus sayith the Lord the move is on for
[1:37:05] the bride that's thus saith the Lord
[1:37:09] what made Abraham what moved him to
[1:37:12] believe that he could have a child in
[1:37:16] his old age it was the moving of the
[1:37:19] Holy Spirit what moved Jesus to walk
[1:37:23] down there by a pool and go in there in
[1:37:26] a hospital room and only pick out one
[1:37:29] man he said I can do nothing except my
[1:37:32] father first showed me what is it he was
[1:37:35] moved by the Holy
[1:37:39] Ghost what is it when you see the
[1:37:42] troubling of the waters
[1:37:45] come what is
[1:37:47] it brother B would tell us he said now
[1:37:49] when you see Waters he said in the Bible
[1:37:51] he he said it represents people and he
[1:37:52] said when you see people being moved by
[1:37:54] the Holy Ghost he said you see it's the
[1:37:56] Angel that's working on the waters and
[1:37:59] you think about this how that your faith
[1:38:01] has been stimulated
[1:38:02] tonight you identify that
[1:38:09] now now what is it it is an angel that
[1:38:12] is here now now you recognize that that
[1:38:14] William William William brandom was
[1:38:16] standing there that we all know that
[1:38:19] there was a healing angel that was
[1:38:20] standing there at the platform he said
[1:38:22] now I don't see him here he said but we
[1:38:24] recognize that he's here he said you
[1:38:26] don't see it between you and I and he
[1:38:28] said I don't see it just it he said but
[1:38:30] I can tell that there's a force that is
[1:38:32] standing between you and I now what was
[1:38:34] it he was identifying that there was
[1:38:36] somebody that was personal to the person
[1:38:40] and that's what I think about is so
[1:38:41] great about our Lord Jesus Christ is
[1:38:44] that he can be so Supernatural to one
[1:38:47] person and that person can think man
[1:38:49] that's the most Supernatural thing
[1:38:51] that's ever happened in my life and
[1:38:53] maybe to the next person they don't
[1:38:54] think that's very Supernatural but
[1:38:56] that's how great God is is that he can
[1:38:58] be Supernatural on the level that you
[1:39:00] are
[1:39:01] at and that's what I think so amazing
[1:39:03] about it is some people they get so
[1:39:05] excited when they lose their car keys
[1:39:07] and then somebody finds them it may not
[1:39:09] mean something to somebody else but it
[1:39:12] means a world to the person that lost
[1:39:13] her keys it may not mean much to you to
[1:39:16] get healed of a headache tonight but the
[1:39:18] person that gets healed of it it's a
[1:39:20] miracle to them and that's what makes
[1:39:22] God so big tonight is that God can come
[1:39:25] down and speak to 250 people and he can
[1:39:28] make himself so Supernatural and you
[1:39:31] don't see it working in here and you
[1:39:34] don't feel it maybe working in here but
[1:39:36] there's a being that is identifying
[1:39:39] itself to every individual and he's
[1:39:42] speaking to them and he's ministering to
[1:39:44] them and he's blessing them and you
[1:39:45] might think man that scripture didn't do
[1:39:47] nothing for me but man had meant the
[1:39:49] world to them
[1:39:51] I don't understand why they're shouting
[1:39:53] like they're
[1:39:55] shouting and maybe they don't understand
[1:39:58] why you're clapping the way you're
[1:39:59] clapping but if they understood on the
[1:40:02] level that you're at if they walked in
[1:40:05] your shoes for a
[1:40:08] mile maybe they would understand that
[1:40:11] it's a
[1:40:12] paradox that you could show up at
[1:40:15] church had all kinds of Hell happen to
[1:40:18] you all this week and then all of a
[1:40:20] sudden Heaven drops
[1:40:31] down now it's going to be a paradox to
[1:40:33] you when your loved one that's done went
[1:40:36] beyond the veil of
[1:40:39] Tears they start walking
[1:40:44] in mother Brandon would say it in
[1:40:46] certain ways you're going to see it
[1:40:49] you'll see them and then will be changed
[1:40:52] and then we'll be changed and then we'll
[1:40:53] see him but as long as we're
[1:40:57] changed as long as we're
[1:40:59] changed and brother man would say it in
[1:41:02] this way when you see them don't be
[1:41:05] afraid what is it it's the culmination
[1:41:08] of your faith it is rapturing Faith on
[1:41:11] you that is Raising you to believe that
[1:41:14] you're getting ready to be gone you're
[1:41:16] going to spend about 30 or 40 days with
[1:41:18] them you're going to fellowship with
[1:41:19] them you're going to see who who's going
[1:41:21] to be there and who's not going to be
[1:41:22] there and it's a paradox I know it's a
[1:41:26] paradox to you but there's going to be
[1:41:28] some people that see them and there's
[1:41:31] going to be people that are sitting here
[1:41:33] tonight that will not see
[1:41:36] them but you'll
[1:41:39] know but you'll
[1:41:44] know but you'll know and I know I don't
[1:41:48] know about you but saying a statement
[1:41:49] like that it makes my heart cry out God
[1:41:53] get a hold of every one of them don't
[1:41:55] let them miss it don't let them miss
[1:41:57] them coming don't let them miss this
[1:42:01] change what was it up there at the pool
[1:42:05] of the C in John chapter 5 there was
[1:42:08] some people that got it and some people
[1:42:10] that didn't get it but this man was
[1:42:12] laying there with excuses but when Jesus
[1:42:15] showed up in the
[1:42:18] room the excuses was God on sister
[1:42:22] Julia they were gone right there because
[1:42:26] Jesus showed
[1:42:27] up come on somebody drop your old habits
[1:42:31] drop your cigarettes drop your alcohol
[1:42:34] drop your
[1:42:36] habits Jesus showed up why' he tell him
[1:42:39] pick up your bed and walk because he
[1:42:40] wasn't going back there to laying at no
[1:42:42] more I ain't going back to that hell
[1:42:44] hole I ain't going back to their beer
[1:42:46] joint I ain't going back to them trials
[1:42:48] I ain't going back to them demons iin I
[1:42:50] ain't going back to them caves I ain't
[1:42:53] going back to them chains I ain't going
[1:42:55] back to that shame I ain't going back to
[1:42:57] that
[1:42:59] guilt I ain't going back to that
[1:43:01] condemnation I'm not going back to that
[1:43:05] sin I hear you I hear you I hear you
[1:43:09] Hallelujah I ain't going back to that
[1:43:11] Legion today's your
[1:43:13] day you're coming out of them gray clo
[1:43:16] turn that air down you're coming down
[1:43:19] you're coming out of there forever
[1:43:20] you're not going back to that no
[1:43:22] more you're not going back to that no
[1:43:25] more you're not going back to that
[1:43:28] cave the things that's bothered you
[1:43:30] they're going to bother you no more the
[1:43:32] things that's troubled you they're going
[1:43:33] to trouble you no
[1:43:36] more I hear you it's a
[1:43:39] paradox but you're going to walk out of
[1:43:42] here you're going to walk out of here
[1:43:49] changed I have locked eyes I have locked
[1:43:53] eyes with the one that's going to set me
[1:43:55] free I have locked eyes and when those
[1:43:58] demons when those demons looked up there
[1:44:00] and they seen Jesus they started crying
[1:44:03] because they knew that that was the one
[1:44:06] that had the power to make them go and
[1:44:09] them demons are screaming out tonight
[1:44:11] but the Holy Ghost is screaming even
[1:44:16] [Music]
[1:44:17] louder I can hear him roaring I can hear
[1:44:21] him roaring but I can hear the Holy
[1:44:22] Ghost I can hear that wind roaring like
[1:44:25] it came down on the mighty day on that
[1:44:27] rushian wind in Acts chapter two and it
[1:44:29] filled all the house where they were
[1:44:30] sitting in let the demons how but the
[1:44:33] wind's coming I hear the sound of the
[1:44:35] abundance of rain are coming tonight
[1:44:38] your blessing is in the
[1:44:42] room ah come on somebody if you can't
[1:44:45] see it and if you can't feel it I want
[1:44:47] you to know the angels in the room the
[1:44:49] angels in the wall ERS it's time for you
[1:44:51] to Simply take a
[1:44:56] step that little boy that little boy
[1:45:00] Drew right
[1:45:03] there he's got a good
[1:45:07] name every single time he puts his foot
[1:45:10] down he's a walking talking
[1:45:13] Miracle what's he doing he's fulfilling
[1:45:16] what Joshua said every place that The
[1:45:18] Souls of your foot tread upon that's
[1:45:20] your land what did I read you Ephesians
[1:45:23] chapter 2 for this is your position this
[1:45:26] is your hour this is your place don't
[1:45:28] you ever let the devil try to rob you
[1:45:31] from your position and your place why
[1:45:33] don't you stand up on your feet March
[1:45:36] down to the enemy's camp and take back
[1:45:38] what the devil stole from
[1:45:40] [Applause]
[1:45:48] you how many years has it been sister
[1:45:51] Bethany how many years has it been since
[1:45:53] Drew's when since Drew's
[1:45:58] Miracle seven
[1:46:00] years and he's still
[1:46:04] walking every single time he wakes up
[1:46:07] and starts walking it's a black eye to
[1:46:09] the
[1:46:12] devil brother Ryan sent me something
[1:46:14] this week on Congressman Upshaw crippled
[1:46:17] for 66
[1:46:18] years but he always believed he always
[1:46:22] believed that he could be healed he
[1:46:24] always believed
[1:46:26] that but when he received his
[1:46:31] healing he lived a year and N nine
[1:46:34] months
[1:46:36] later but he was perfectly whole the
[1:46:39] entire
[1:46:41] time you may have walked in here one way
[1:46:44] but you'll walk out of here another
[1:46:47] way I'm prophesying to you tonight you
[1:46:50] you're going to walk in here one way and
[1:46:52] you're going to walk out another way a
[1:46:54] miracle walked in the room when you
[1:46:56] showed up because you're identifying
[1:47:00] with a headship that the angel the
[1:47:03] mighty Angel is working over this body
[1:47:06] of
[1:47:08] Believers the Rapture is working on the
[1:47:11] inside of
[1:47:13] you s years and he's still
[1:47:19] walking
[1:47:22] 16 years 16 years a man laying in a coma
[1:47:27] a man laying there and induced coma 17
[1:47:31] days burn all over 170% of his body
[1:47:35] burned 75% of his lungs
[1:47:37] burnt but 16
[1:47:41] years the God still got a
[1:47:49] testimony
[1:47:51] it's a
[1:47:52] paradox but it's
[1:47:58] true now I'm going read you this brother
[1:48:03] bisco's granddaughter Ella she means a
[1:48:05] lot to the Spencer
[1:48:07] family she shared this with us while we
[1:48:10] was at Mount Baker campus
[1:48:12] summer and I I forget exactly all the
[1:48:14] details but she had she was going into
[1:48:17] her she was going into her dorm and she
[1:48:19] was going to turn on a tape or and then
[1:48:21] another tape came on or another tape was
[1:48:25] playing and she shared this with us
[1:48:29] brother brandham brother brandham is is
[1:48:30] sitting there and he's praying he said
[1:48:32] God how happy we would be he said if you
[1:48:35] just now I know you've already done the
[1:48:37] healing he said if you could just give
[1:48:39] them a little extra push tonight as it
[1:48:41] was just push them into the pool while
[1:48:44] it's
[1:48:45] troubled Lord just give them a little
[1:48:47] extra push while it's troubled Lord
[1:48:50] granted may maybe that same angel that
[1:48:53] whired down from the skies troubled that
[1:48:55] water maybe that's the same one that
[1:48:57] come night after night I I do not know
[1:48:59] thou knowest but the Bible said it was
[1:49:01] an angel and I believe that I pray
[1:49:02] father that while the waters will be
[1:49:05] stirred tonight trouble choppy people
[1:49:07] raising up here looking at that
[1:49:08] screaming out many many everyone the
[1:49:11] angel of God just just spread his great
[1:49:13] wings as it were around this building
[1:49:15] tonight and push every one of them right
[1:49:17] into the pool and may there come a
[1:49:19] perfect healing tonight healing of the
[1:49:21] soul and body through this body May
[1:49:24] there not be a feeble one Lord left I I
[1:49:26] know according to your word I know
[1:49:29] according to your word Lord is all I
[1:49:31] have to go by and with all that I know
[1:49:34] how to believe I believe that you've
[1:49:36] already paid for every person in here to
[1:49:38] be well I believe that our lord Jesus
[1:49:40] thy son did that at Calvary and he said
[1:49:43] all things are possible if you just
[1:49:46] believe it when you pray believe that
[1:49:48] you receive what you ask for and you
[1:49:51] shall have
[1:49:52] it now this
[1:49:55] girl you forgive me but this girl is a
[1:49:59] girl but she's got the most
[1:50:03] powerful faith of any person I
[1:50:06] know I'm not making you feel bad but I
[1:50:09] want you to know that she's got that
[1:50:11] kind of faith that girl you can feel her
[1:50:14] in the
[1:50:15] room she's got that kind of atmosphere
[1:50:17] about her
[1:50:19] I the angel of the Lord stands real
[1:50:21] close to that girl but there she sits in
[1:50:24] that condition and she ain't received
[1:50:26] her healing yet but she's that got that
[1:50:29] kind of
[1:50:30] faith and this quote is playing while
[1:50:33] she walks into her room at
[1:50:36] night while we were working in that
[1:50:38] prayer line I could just
[1:50:41] feel I could just feel the supernatural
[1:50:43] taking place and something I I
[1:50:46] personally I never witnessed before was
[1:50:48] happening and Katie can identified to
[1:50:50] this is that that when those young
[1:50:53] people were coming off that prayer line
[1:50:55] they would they were literally they were
[1:50:58] pushed from one end by a being they were
[1:51:00] pushed into a circle and young boys were
[1:51:03] praying together and young girls were
[1:51:05] praying together and she may not even WR
[1:51:08] recognize what was happening but I
[1:51:10] simply I whed around to her and said are
[1:51:12] you watching I don't know if she even
[1:51:14] caught what I was talking about I said
[1:51:15] are you watching the quote that she had
[1:51:18] just sent was taking place these young
[1:51:21] people were pushed into the
[1:51:24] waters maybe you don't understand what's
[1:51:27] happening here tonight but I hope you're
[1:51:29] watching I hope you're watching is that
[1:51:32] there's a people that's being pushed
[1:51:34] into the Waters of the supernatural I
[1:51:37] hope you're watching here tonight
[1:51:39] because there's somebody's Faith that's
[1:51:41] raising up to believe that tonight
[1:51:44] they're walking out of here the last
[1:51:46] time they stay at this bed they stay in
[1:51:49] this position
[1:51:51] come on somebody you're seated in
[1:51:53] Heavenly places you're an overcomer this
[1:51:56] is your seat this is your
[1:52:00] position blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:52:03] Jesus
[1:52:04] Christ brother random said he said I was
[1:52:07] a hillbilly Kian he said but that angel
[1:52:10] told me that I was going to go pray for
[1:52:12] kings and monarchs he said how could I
[1:52:15] believe that he said me a hillbilly
[1:52:18] Kentucky and how could I I believe that
[1:52:21] he said but that angel had never told me
[1:52:24] nothing wrong he said so I had to
[1:52:26] believe it when he prayed for King
[1:52:29] George and when he prayed for
[1:52:31] Congressman Upshaw what was he doing he
[1:52:33] was identifying that he was praying for
[1:52:36] kings and he was praying for
[1:52:39] monarchs William brandom said he was
[1:52:41] doing the same thing that Daniel
[1:52:45] did Hallelujah he was doing the same
[1:52:49] thing that d Daniel did he simply was
[1:52:51] taking God at his
[1:52:53] word he was taking God at his
[1:52:57] word when Daniel heard they were going
[1:52:59] to throw him in a lion's den when they
[1:53:01] heard he couldn't when they told him
[1:53:03] that he wasn't going to be able to pray
[1:53:04] no
[1:53:06] more Hallelujah when he
[1:53:11] heard when he heard they didn't want him
[1:53:14] to worship no more Daniel still did what
[1:53:17] God asked him to do
[1:53:20] he didn't do something
[1:53:23] new he did what he always did he threw
[1:53:27] up the curtains and he begin to
[1:53:29] pray because he expected God to be with
[1:53:32] him in his
[1:53:34] prayer brother bam said I trusted that
[1:53:37] angel I trusted that angel and he led me
[1:53:40] to do what was right and Daniel trusted
[1:53:43] the word of the Lord and he expected him
[1:53:45] to be there brother mam said it like
[1:53:47] this he said he expected God to to be in
[1:53:50] that Lin's Den he said because there had
[1:53:52] been an atonement that was made up there
[1:53:55] at the temple there was a burning
[1:53:57] sacrifice up there that there was an
[1:53:59] innocent substitute that had gave its
[1:54:02] life and it was a sign to Daniel even
[1:54:06] though he was in the valley of the
[1:54:07] shadow of death even though it was going
[1:54:09] to stop the mouth of lions and he would
[1:54:12] be a hero of
[1:54:14] Faith he was expecting God to be there
[1:54:23] what is
[1:54:25] it your faith showed
[1:54:28] up your faith showed
[1:54:34] up and brother Maron would said like
[1:54:36] this he
[1:54:38] said I know it's hard for you to believe
[1:54:41] but every Christian is a
[1:54:44] miracle you're a
[1:54:46] paradox you're a Believer you're Faith
[1:54:49] showed up another would say now I can
[1:54:53] feel your faith I can feel your faith I
[1:54:56] can tell you're a real Christian your
[1:54:58] your spirit that you have it's an
[1:55:00] identification to me that you're a real
[1:55:06] Christian you're a real
[1:55:09] Christian what is it it's identifying
[1:55:12] that what you have believed
[1:55:14] in is none other than the truth because
[1:55:18] God is going to work
[1:55:20] is vindicating power through
[1:55:24] you you've been marked by the
[1:55:32] Vindication you forgive me just a
[1:55:36] minute you ever walked into the wrong
[1:55:40] bathroom has a weird feeling ain't
[1:55:47] it make you feel like a big
[1:55:54] dummy not unless you're that kind of
[1:55:59] guy go to Target all the time any
[1:56:02] who we ever walked into a
[1:56:05] bathroom things don't look right to
[1:56:08] you like oh shoot I'm in the wrong place
[1:56:12] I'm in the wrong
[1:56:14] place you know I'd say that's a way the
[1:56:18] devil walks out of here tonight I solded
[1:56:20] up at the wrong
[1:56:23] place I walked in there thinking I was
[1:56:26] in the right place but when your faith
[1:56:29] showed up he said oh I'm in the wrong
[1:56:31] I'm in the wrong I'm in the wrong I'm in
[1:56:35] the wrong I'm in the wrong place I'm in
[1:56:38] the wrong
[1:56:40] place you went in there thinking that
[1:56:43] you was going to take care of business
[1:56:45] but you was in the wrong place it's kind
[1:56:48] of like David said blessed be the name
[1:56:51] of the Lord and bless His holy name
[1:56:54] blessed be the name of the Lord and
[1:56:56] forget not all of his benefits who
[1:56:58] Health thee of all thy iniquities who
[1:57:00] forgiveth thee of all thy
[1:57:04] diseases the devil showed up at the
[1:57:06] wrong
[1:57:07] place your faith has identified who you
[1:57:18] are
[1:57:20] what am I saying to
[1:57:22] you you're a
[1:57:24] paradox you're you're a real
[1:57:29] Paradox you're a real
[1:57:32] Paradox you're a real
[1:57:37] Paradox I wish you could feel what I
[1:57:39] feel maybe you do maybe that's why you
[1:57:42] got that look on your
[1:57:47] face you're a
[1:57:50] incredible much of
[1:57:53] true sister Morris she shared something
[1:57:56] with me a few weeks ago she was given a
[1:57:58] watch for for a special gift from her
[1:58:02] son and
[1:58:03] daughter-in-law she lost that gift lost
[1:58:06] that watch she will look for it
[1:58:08] everywhere she look for it everywhere
[1:58:11] she looked in places that it shouldn't
[1:58:12] be and everything else and 6 months
[1:58:15] later I was preaching to you two two
[1:58:18] weeks ago when a paradox of a promise
[1:58:19] about brother brandom
[1:58:21] saying if I needed that little Barlo
[1:58:23] knife in my pocket it could be right
[1:58:25] there she testified to me she said I had
[1:58:28] lost that watch and I'd looked
[1:58:29] everywhere she said but I went and
[1:58:31] looked in the Box this this week and I
[1:58:34] looked in there and there that watch was
[1:58:36] in a place that I never would have put
[1:58:38] it but when something means so much to
[1:58:41] you if it's interesting to you it's
[1:58:44] interesting to almighty God if he cared
[1:58:47] about a little bitty possum and the
[1:58:48] possum had that kind of faith that she
[1:58:50] could go by the way of a prophet how
[1:58:52] much more can you be a paradox here
[1:58:54] tonight and go by the way of Jesus
[1:58:57] Christ what do you think of this Jesus
[1:58:59] do you think he's still a miracle worker
[1:59:02] do you still think he's a promis keeper
[1:59:04] do you still think he's a way maker do
[1:59:06] you still think is a light in the
[1:59:09] darkness what do you think about it
[1:59:11] God's interested in little bit he owe
[1:59:14] you God ain't never disappointed you God
[1:59:17] ain't never let you down
[1:59:22] the angel has showed up to do the
[1:59:26] [Applause]
