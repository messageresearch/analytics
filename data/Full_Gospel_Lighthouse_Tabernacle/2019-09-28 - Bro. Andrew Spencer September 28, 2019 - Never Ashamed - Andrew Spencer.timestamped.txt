[0:04] Oh

[0:25] it makes me want to see when I go to
[0:29] thinking about my king I can't praise
[0:32] Him enough I could never express it
[0:35] through through all the words in the
[0:38] dictionary how much I love him
[0:40] how much he means to me the god I serve
[0:44] sister julia is big enough
[0:48] the god I serve is strong enough the god
[0:54] I serve is wealthy enough the god I
[0:57] serve amen is good to be in the house of
[1:01] the Lord if you have your Bibles this
[1:02] evening or turn to the book of Mark
[1:05] chapter 8 in verse 34 thank you for
[1:09] praying for us last weekend as we were
[1:11] there with the young people at brother
[1:13] Joe greens youth banquet and with
[1:17] brother Danny and we certainly enjoyed
[1:18] our time there and I know that the young
[1:22] people were certainly blessed and
[1:24] looking forward to seeing brother Joe
[1:26] next weekend and whether Joe is a part
[1:29] of our family
[1:30] part of my mind my wife's natural family
[1:34] but he's a part of the family of God and
[1:36] I'm just thrilled to have brother Joe
[1:38] amongst us next weekend hey man we'd
[1:43] like to speak to you tonight on a
[1:45] thought on never ashamed a very simple
[1:49] thought but I'd like to speak to you on
[1:51] this thought never ashamed mark chapter
[2:00] 8 and verse 34 and when he had called
[2:02] the people unto him with his disciples
[2:05] also he said unto them whosoever will
[2:07] come after me let him deny himself and
[2:11] take up his cross and follow me
[2:13] for whosoever will save his life shall
[2:17] lose it but whosoever shall lose his
[2:20] life for my sake and the Gospels the
[2:23] same shall save it what shall it profit
[2:26] a man profit a man if he shall gain the
[2:29] whole world and lose his own soul or
[2:32] what shall a man give in exchange for
[2:34] his soul notice whosoever therefore
[2:37] shall be ashamed of me and of my words
[2:40] in this adulterous and sinful generation
[2:43] I believe that describes and depicts the
[2:47] age that we're living in of him also
[2:50] shall the Son of Man be ashamed when he
[2:53] cometh in the glory of his father with
[2:56] the Holy Angels how many here has a need
[2:58] that you'd like to take before the Lord
[3:00] evening amen let's bow our hearts before
[3:02] him tonight in prayer Heavenly Father we

[3:07] Lord and our Savior Lord were your
[3:09] children today and Lord we are hunger in
[3:12] the whedon want to be fed Lord and our
[3:15] desire is for for more of you and less

[3:22] upon your children upon those that are
[3:25] needy hear those hands that were lifted
[3:27] up father you know the heart's desire
[3:29] below it father we pray that you'd
[3:31] minister to them in a supernatural way
[3:33] we pray that you would take the Horn of
[3:36] the oil or the anointing oil and pour it
[3:38] over your children and Lord and envelope
[3:41] us in your presence here tonight and
[3:42] speak through us to us through your Holy
[3:44] Word tonight through these few words of
[3:47] man father we pray that you'd speak to
[3:49] us Lord we know that your word is
[3:51] anointed already but I pray that you
[3:53] would anoint Lord your servant Lord
[3:55] anoint the ears I pray that you'd speak
[3:58] to us tonight and we'll be careful to
[3:59] serve you and give you all the praise
[4:01] and honor and Jesus Christ's name and
[4:03] the bride says and you can have your
[4:06] seats this evening
[4:07] a man's we said would like to speak to
[4:10] you on this thought or never ashamed I
[4:13] know that as we just kind of set a
[4:16] little basis here we could take this all
[4:18] kinds of different ways but we'll just
[4:20] trust that the Lord would lead us
[4:22] tonight in the direction in which he'd
[4:24] like to take us I know that in life and
[4:26] especially in a young person's life or
[4:29] any person sitting here I'd say that if
[4:31] all of us were honest here this evening
[4:33] there's there's been certain times in
[4:35] our lives that we have either made our
[4:37] self ashamed or made our parents ashamed
[4:40] or embarrassed of what the things or the
[4:42] actions that we have done by our conduct
[4:44] and by our character I'm sure that we
[4:46] could all say here if we would all just
[4:48] just agree for a moment to say that yeah
[4:51] there's been times in life that I did
[4:53] some things that that I that embarrassed
[4:55] myself and and maybe as a young person
[4:57] you don't even realize things that
[4:59] you're doing right now but you'll look
[5:01] back on them later on in life and you'll
[5:03] say man that was very embarrassing
[5:04] moment in my life and and you know
[5:07] there's some people that there's some
[5:09] people that just seem like they can
[5:10] never get embarrassed
[5:11] they never get rid in their face but yet
[5:14] you know I find in life that I've been
[5:16] I've been hurt in life a few times I've
[5:18] been I've been embarrassed in my life
[5:20] but I couldn't imagine my heavenly
[5:23] Father saying to me that I'm embarrassed
[5:26] by your actions I'm sure that there's a
[5:29] lot of things that in our in our own
[5:30] lives that there have been things that
[5:32] we've done and we have done and
[5:34] committed against God that there are
[5:36] moments in our life that we're so
[5:38] thankful that there's a blood there
[5:40] we're thankful that there's mercy still
[5:43] on the throne because surely I know that
[5:46] I'm setting a bunk amongst a bunch of
[5:48] angels but I know that there might be a
[5:49] few humans here tonight that understand
[5:51] what I'm saying that there have been
[5:53] moments maybe in this past week that you
[5:56] have had an embarrassing moment as a
[5:57] Christian maybe maybe had a little slip
[5:59] of the tongue or maybe you let somebody
[6:01] down or maybe you let God down but you
[6:04] know I can't imagine to get there and to
[6:06] face and a mighty and a judgmental God
[6:10] on that day without the blood I can't
[6:12] imagine him to say to me depart from me
[6:15] I never knew you because you embarrassed
[6:17] me I'm embarrassed by your actions that
[6:20] word a shame means embarrassed or guilty
[6:23] by one's actions characteristics or
[6:26] associations and and I and oftentimes
[6:28] maybe we're embarrassed because of what
[6:30] our friends have done but we know that
[6:32] birds of a feather flock together the
[6:35] word ashamed means reluctant to do
[6:37] something through fear or embarrassment
[6:40] or humiliation you're reluctant to do
[6:44] something and a lot of times people are
[6:47] reluctant to to say that they're a
[6:49] Christian so that they save themselves
[6:51] the embarrassment of the peer pressure
[6:53] of the world that they live in or save
[6:55] themself of of the humiliation as a
[6:58] young person oftentimes that's where you
[7:00] deal with it but oftentimes you'll face
[7:02] it on your job or face it out in the
[7:04] world you many times you'll hear it
[7:06] maybe you'll shy away from saying that
[7:08] you're a Christian but I want to say
[7:09] that I'm never ashamed to bear say that
[7:12] I'm a Christian
[7:13] in the message the shamed he said I
[7:16] think of the prophets of old when they
[7:18] come with that message and it
[7:20] embarrassed the kings that made people
[7:22] feel uncomfortable and that's exactly
[7:24] what the message does today it makes
[7:27] people uncomfortable it embarrasses them
[7:29] and these priests they would even feel
[7:31] uncomfortable because they were supposed
[7:33] to be leaders religious men the word
[7:36] came forth in that manner it exposed
[7:39] them and they felt embarrassed or
[7:41] ashamed and that's the same thing today
[7:44] you that's what the word does this is
[7:46] the house of correction and it goes
[7:48] through those spots in your life maybe
[7:50] that you're ashamed of it but yet this
[7:53] is the place where you can fix those
[7:54] spots of embarrassment that you don't
[7:56] have to live that way the rest of your
[7:58] life you don't have to live in
[7:59] embarrassment or insane menteur in
[8:01] guilty there's a god that's here that it
[8:04] that is here to to set you free to set
[8:07] you free from your bounds of I've
[8:09] ashamed this and to to lay upon you a a
[8:12] robe of righteousness but you know today
[8:16] that they will live in it such a
[8:18] sociably or a politically correct day
[8:20] that men want to say things that
[8:22] pleasing to everybody you can't say
[8:24] anything anymore without offending
[8:26] somebody so as you know it's a Christian
[8:30] I'm just going to say what the word says
[8:31] so it's long it may it may offend
[8:33] somebody it may hurt somebody's feelings
[8:35] but as long as I'm on the word no matter
[8:38] if no matter if I sit back and think my
[8:40] Jesus did I really say that as long as
[8:43] it's upon the basis of the word I could
[8:46] never be ashamed of his word my word
[8:49] surely I could be ashamed of but his
[8:51] word I could never be ashamed of but we
[8:55] find the day that we live in it's a day
[8:57] where where people are ashamed to call
[8:59] the name Jesus it's it's not politically
[9:03] correct to say the name Jesus anymore
[9:05] and sister Charlene was sharing
[9:07] something with me last week as we were
[9:09] on that on the way down to North
[9:10] Carolina that there was a woman that was
[9:12] in her class I wouldn't say a lady but a
[9:14] woman who has in her class that had told
[9:17] her professor that there are certain
[9:20] words that
[9:21] that just trigger her that offset her
[9:23] they're their words which to set her off
[9:25] their trigger words and the top one on
[9:28] the list was the name Jesus that was her
[9:32] trigger word her top trigger word was
[9:35] the name Jesus but I find it so amazing
[9:37] today but that is the only name in which
[9:40] circumcised Asian is through the name of
[9:43] Jesus you see men are ashamed of the
[9:46] name of Jesus they don't want to call
[9:47] that name you see they're ashamed of the
[9:50] life that's behind that name they're
[9:52] ashamed of the power that's behind that
[9:54] name they're ashamed of the character
[9:56] that's behind that name they're ashamed
[9:58] of the name of Jesus they're ashamed of
[10:02] that name but you know I find it so
[10:05] amazing that that they're not ashamed to
[10:08] take the Lord's name in vain
[10:09] but yet they're ashamed to be called by
[10:11] that name they are saying to to speak
[10:14] that name they don't want you speaking
[10:15] that name around them or it might just
[10:17] trigger them and they'll have them self
[10:19] a little hissy fit they know what you're
[10:21] saying the name Jesus because there's so
[10:24] much power in the name of Jesus that
[10:26] it'll drive back every fear it'll drive
[10:29] back every sickness and every every
[10:31] temptation there's so much power in it
[10:33] that the devil don't want that name
[10:36] mentioned around him that's why people
[10:38] enjoy hanging out in cemeteries is
[10:42] because they they they stay there where
[10:45] the devil wants to keep them and the
[10:47] name of Jesus is nowhere near a dead
[10:49] place but you know I find it amazing
[10:53] that when when nobody wants to say the
[10:56] name Jesus no more but yet get yourself
[10:59] in trouble and you find yourself calling
[11:01] on the very Jesus that you did not want
[11:04] to be identified with find yourself in a
[11:07] spot when you're in trouble and call on
[11:09] the name Jesus people are same to be
[11:12] called by the name of Jesus or call on
[11:15] the name of Jesus but I'm not ashamed
[11:18] I'm not a saying you wait you wait until
[11:21] the doctor says you only got six months
[11:23] to live and you call on the name of
[11:25] Jesus you go you get yourself in a spot
[11:27] when the doctor says you got cancer of
[11:30] the breast or yea cancer of the throat
[11:32] you got
[11:33] three allocates or but he got this that
[11:35] or the other and you'll find yourself
[11:37] calling on the name Jesus I shall never
[11:41] be a sane of the mighty one the great I
[11:45] am as Christians we should never allow
[11:48] the name Jesus to depart from our lips
[11:51] unless it's in holy and pure matrimony
[11:54] with a saint where they say two five
[11:56] thought in mind we should speak that
[11:58] name when fear starts rising speak the
[12:02] name Jesus when cancer starts raising
[12:05] its ugly head speak the name Jesus oh I
[12:09] say to you and politically correct
[12:11] people don't want you saying the name
[12:13] Jesus oh I would not do it just to
[12:16] offend you but do not tell me not to say
[12:20] the name Jesus behind that name is my
[12:22] salvation behind that name is power
[12:25] behind that name is healing behind that
[12:28] name is deliverance you can do what you
[12:34] want to of your life but as for me don't
[12:48] say that word it's a trigger word for me
[12:51] you know I found in life that's a
[12:53] trigger word for me as well you know I
[12:56] find that a lot of times as the demons
[12:58] of Hell begin to scream when they
[13:00] realize that I got my finger on the
[13:02] trigger because they know that it'll
[13:04] blow Satan right back to hail demons
[13:07] tremble at that name well don't touch
[13:09] the trigger you know sometimes I just
[13:12] get trigger-happy when I go to dealing
[13:14] with the devil well it's my trigger word
[13:22] you're absolutely correct
[13:24] it's my trigger word men are ashamed of
[13:32] the anointing today they don't dare
[13:33] don't dare say Amen don't dare call on
[13:37] the God of heaven
[13:38] there are same to that pillar fire right
[13:40] there
[13:41] they're ashamed of the message they're
[13:43] shamed of the Prophet but I shall never
[13:47] be ashamed if we look over in the book
[13:51] of Esther we would see there that the
[13:55] King one of the greatest kings of the
[13:57] world at that time a high Souris known
[14:00] as search sees that that King had a had
[14:03] a great feast and he called the Queen to
[14:06] come by him but she wouldn't do it she
[14:09] refused to do so and he was so
[14:12] embarrassed he was so ashamed so
[14:16] humiliated that his own wife wouldn't
[14:19] even come to his feast that he was
[14:21] having I think that's all away a lot of
[14:25] that's I think that's a whole lot like
[14:27] Christ today Christ has invited us to
[14:31] set in heavenly places with him and were
[14:34] ashamed of it many people are saying to
[14:36] say that they got the baptism of the
[14:38] holy ghost Pentecostal people that's
[14:41] right they're ashamed to say we're
[14:42] ashamed of him and so the Queen wouldn't
[14:45] come and she refused to come it
[14:48] humiliated him and his face turned red
[14:51] and everybody everybody in the kingdom
[14:54] noticed that fast he would not come to
[14:58] the feast you know this is the greatest
[15:01] privilege that I've ever had in my life
[15:03] to be able to call on the King's name to
[15:06] be able to worship in his name to say
[15:09] that I'm a part of him and he's a part
[15:11] of me but you see investees refusal and
[15:15] investees demise here came Esther's
[15:18] birth and her and her eyes and her her
[15:22] initiation into the kingdom you see
[15:25] there's been those that have turned
[15:27] Christ down but it brought about for us
[15:30] a great triumph there's been those that
[15:33] do not want to call on the name of Jesus
[15:35] but it is it is by that name that we are
[15:38] the Queen of Heaven and I say to you
[15:41] never be ashamed of your position the
[15:45] Bible says in Romans 9 and 33 as it is
[15:48] written behold I lay in Zion assembling
[15:51] a stumbling stone
[15:53] in Iraq of offense and whosoever
[15:55] believeth on him shall not be ashamed
[15:58] second Timothy 1 and 12 for the which
[16:01] cause I also suffer these things
[16:03] nevertheless I am NOT a saint Oh
[16:07] hallelujah I was appointed by Christ I
[16:11] was called by Christ nevertheless I am
[16:14] NOT a saint I am NOT embarrassed I am
[16:18] not guilty for I know whom I have
[16:22] believed if you're sitting there and
[16:24] you're ashamed to be identified with me
[16:27] tonight it's because you do not know in
[16:29] whom you have believed I am persuaded
[16:34] that he is able to keep that which I
[16:37] have committed unto him against that day
[16:39] and another thing that that being
[16:43] ashamed does it shows you that you're
[16:45] not sure of what you're talking about
[16:47] if you know what you're talking about
[16:50] and have the assurance that you know
[16:52] what you're talking about you can tell
[16:54] anybody about that you're not ashamed
[16:57] you see there's no way that I walk to
[17:00] this pulpit tonight unless I knew that
[17:02] he was with me but because I know that
[17:06] is with me I can walk foolish shortly
[17:09] through this pulpit tonight that he said
[17:11] he never leave me that he would give me
[17:13] the words to speak that the Holy Ghost
[17:15] is in me I can walk here assuredly
[17:18] knowing that he's here but if you feel
[17:22] put out or out of place it shows that
[17:24] you're not sure and we find that too
[17:27] often today when when men are unsure
[17:30] themselves and women are ensure of what
[17:32] they believe in or what they stand for
[17:34] we live in a day where people don't even
[17:36] know who they are I was so just the
[17:38] other day that there's four different
[17:40] genders nowadays people don't know what
[17:42] they are you're either a boy or a girl
[17:44] or something else or a horse men are
[17:50] lovers of themselves more than they are
[17:53] the lovers of God but yet something on
[17:56] the inside of that human being wants to
[17:59] attach themselves with a covering with a
[18:01] religion they wear where they can cover
[18:04] them
[18:04] health and appease their guilty
[18:06] conscience so that they can feel safe
[18:08] and sure they won't attach himself to
[18:13] some Creed or some kind of religion but
[18:16] you see America a long time ago wanted
[18:20] and voted in sissified preachers that
[18:22] we're not staying upon the Word of God
[18:24] where sissified preachers are ashamed to
[18:27] say what the truth is not only will they
[18:31] be held responsible for what they have
[18:33] said but they will be responsible for
[18:35] what they have not said see if you're
[18:47] ashamed you're unsure you're embarrassed
[18:49] and there they are unsure in the God
[18:53] that they're serving you look at the you
[18:56] look at the world I'm not I'm not
[18:58] pointing no fingers and nobody it's only
[19:00] by grace and I know and whom I have
[19:01] believed but you look at the world they
[19:04] don't know what they believe in they
[19:05] just point to a church or they point to
[19:07] a bishop or they point to a pope and
[19:09] they want to leave everything on the
[19:10] Pope but I'm afraid sometimes that that
[19:12] tries to enter itself in to the message
[19:15] and say well I'm just gonna leave it up
[19:17] for the pastor or the preacher to do it
[19:20] it's your job to get on your knees it's
[19:24] your job to pray it's your job to read
[19:27] it's your job to sing it's your job this
[19:30] house
[19:31] don't let the sound leader do it don't
[19:33] ever be ashamed a Full Gospel lighthouse
[19:35] and what it stands upon for what we
[19:38] stand upon is the full gospel
[19:41] [Applause]
[19:47] people have no clue what they believe in
[19:50] no more I was sent a clip this week of
[19:52] people actually sitting down at having a
[19:55] church service confessing their sins to
[19:58] plants own the one that sustains him and
[20:04] feeds them they confess their guilt they
[20:07] confess their shame they confess all of
[20:09] their sins upon this plan they have not
[20:13] worshipped one bit who made that point
[20:17] and you cannot worship tonight unless
[20:22] there is a blood you see if you have a
[20:25] bloodless religion you have a powerless
[20:28] religion there's no power to remit or
[20:31] take away sins that plant has no power
[20:35] this fake plant right here just does as
[20:38] good as that real plant it has no
[20:40] atoning power to take away your sins now
[20:45] if I was serving a god like that I could
[20:47] be ashamed of something like that but
[20:51] I'm not serving a god that I have to be
[20:53] embarrassed about this God washes me
[20:56] this Scott changed me this scott feldman
[20:59] this scott save me i shall never be
[21:03] ashamed
[21:08] glory you take a look out you take a
[21:18] look out on the streets and you can see
[21:20] that it's weak pulpits that are
[21:23] producing the lifes that are lived out
[21:25] there in the early 1900's they would
[21:29] lock you up for walking down the street
[21:31] the way men and women walked down the
[21:34] street they'd lock you up for walking
[21:37] down the street with no clothes on but
[21:39] they just passed a law in six states
[21:41] where women can walk down the street
[21:43] completely topless and they'll all can't
[21:46] do nothing about it
[21:47] this is the age of insanity
[21:53] men are no longer women are no longer
[21:56] ashamed to strip their clothes off

[22:07] unashamed they're completely they're not
[22:10] ashamed of their actions but don't you

[22:34] clothes and it's still a shame for a
[22:36] woman to put on man's clothes they're

[22:58] idiot that's inside of them well I'm
[23:01] expressing myself you absolutely are
[23:03] expressing yourself you're expressing
[23:05] the realm in which you are birthed from
[23:15] you can look at my natural voice
[23:18] you can search throughout my my lineage
[23:20] there's nothing but bootleggers and
[23:22] cutthroats and all kinds of hypocrites
[23:25] and all kinds of things in my natural
[23:27] birth there's a lot of things I could
[23:29] say good about my natural birth but

[23:32] or pull but I can brag a whole lot about
[23:34] my second birth

[24:23] because they were under the veil of the
[24:26] Holy Spirit
[24:27] but Satan slips into the garden and
[24:29] swept over the veil of lust over Eve Eve
[24:32] and it cause he closed the fog and today
[24:36] you look at the prophecy in Revelations
[24:39] 3 and 14 of the age that we're living in
[24:42] where an age where they're naked
[24:44] blond and miserable and don't even know
[24:46] it but you see they're not under the
[24:50] veil of the Holy Spirit they are under

[29:36] him not be ashamed but let him glorify
[29:39] God on this

[29:47] make fun of you but you've got nothing
[29:49] to be ashamed about the message they're
[29:53] mocking is the person Christ that lives
[29:56] in your soul let them make fun of him
[30:00] they will make fun of him they're gonna
[30:02] make fun of you but they're not making
[30:04] fun of you they're making fine of the

[30:28] body

[30:31] time oh look what the Lord has done
[30:37] today we have to have the best we have
[30:42] to have the best homes we have to have
[30:44] the best clothes what will we do when we
[30:47] stand in the presence of those men who
[30:50] wondered and goat skins and sheep skins
[30:52] no place to lay their heads wondering
[30:54] about him deserts and somebody can make
[30:57] fun of us and we're ready to quit church
[31:00] and not go back anymore what
[31:04] Christianity requires today we ought to
[31:06] be ashamed of ourselves not ashamed of
[31:10] this gospel Paul said in Romans 1 and 16
[31:16] for I am not ashamed say with me I am
[31:20] not ashamed say it to you believe it I
[31:25] am not ashamed for the gospel of Christ
[31:28] for it is the power of God unto
[31:31] salvation to every one that believeth to
[31:34] the Jew first and also to the Greek
[31:38] I'm not ashamed of this gospel
[31:43] if you're afraid to testify to your
[31:45] friends is showing that you're ashamed
[31:48] Noah wasn't ashamed to testify to his
[31:51] friends they sure seemed foolish to
[31:54] everybody that was living in his day
[31:55] that gob was going to send down rain
[31:58] from heaven in which they had the
[32:00] instruments to tell Noah they no such
[32:02] thing as called water up there but he
[32:06] was not ashamed to preach this gospel
[32:08] for a hundred and twenty years while
[32:11] everybody around him was mocking him
[32:13] making fun of him trying to build of
[32:17] trying to build a gospel that was sure
[32:19] to sink Noah was not ashamed of the
[32:23] gospel that would rise him up then why
[32:28] should we be ashamed of this gospel that
[32:31] has risen us out of the dog bus and out
[32:33] of the Creed's and has called us to come
[32:35] out and be ye separate Moses Abraham
[32:43] wasn't ashamed he wasn't ashamed to
[32:47] testify that he was going to have a baby
[32:49] by his wife Sarah even when it looked
[32:52] humanly impossible for it to take place
[32:55] when everything the doctor said that it
[32:58] wasn't going to happen
[32:59] he still testified that he was going to
[33:02] have a baby all of his friends making
[33:06] fun of him said yeah father of Nations
[33:08] but you ain't got one son yet but he was
[33:12] not ashamed to testify that God had
[33:15] talked to him and he staggered not at
[33:18] the promise of God but he was strong
[33:21] giving praises to God because of the
[33:24] promise it may look humanly impossible
[33:29] but Abraham considered not his own body
[33:32] when I look at this old flesh I consider
[33:36] not this body for the rapture
[33:39] you see I consider not these 16 elements
[33:41] I don't know how these 16 elements are
[33:44] going to get me out of here
[33:45] I know there's something packet on the
[33:47] inside of my soul that one of these
[33:51] morning's gravity is going to turn loose
[33:56] I'm not ashamed of it
[33:59] Abraham wasn't ashamed of it Moses
[34:02] wasn't ashamed of it to walk out of
[34:05] Egypt where he was heir to the throne
[34:08] and he turned down the wealthiest
[34:11] kingdoms that there was but the Bible
[34:14] said that my faith Moses when he came to
[34:18] years Hebrews 11 and 24 when he came to
[34:20] years he refused to be called the son of
[34:23] Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to
[34:26] suffer affliction with the people of God
[34:27] than enjoy the pleasures of sin for a
[34:30] season esteeming the reproach of Christ
[34:38] he joined in the reproach of Christ whoa
[34:43] hallelu greater riches than the
[34:47] treasures in Egypt for he had recompense
[34:50] he had respect unto the recompense of
[34:52] his reward you read over this so easily
[34:58] that this is just another story of Moses
[35:00] this is just a story about a man that
[35:03] that went out to the desert see the bush
[35:05] that was on fire came back told told
[35:07] Pharaoh I'm I'm taking him by with me
[35:10] walk out and goes through the Red Sea
[35:11] it's more than a story this was a huge
[35:16] huge deal for this man to walk out of
[35:21] Egypt to leave everything and come back
[35:26] when Pharaoh had the greatest army there
[35:29] was in all the world at their time had
[35:32] the greatest horses had the greatest
[35:34] chariots but he was not ashamed to walk
[35:38] back up in the face of Pharaoh and tell
[35:40] him I met God face to face young people
[35:46] that's what it takes
[35:47] is you meeting God face to face
[35:53] you see if you just said well I've got a
[35:55] full bounce of a lighthouse and you've
[35:57] never had a true experience there will
[35:59] be a moment in your life when you are
[36:01] ashamed of Christ I'm sorry but that's
[36:05] just the way it is you see you've got to
[36:08] have an experience where you can say
[36:10] that I met him I met him face to face
[36:15] Moses would have never walked back down
[36:18] there to Egypt being a castaway known as
[36:22] a murderer known as a man that kills the
[36:25] Egyptians and walk back down there and
[36:28] said I'm coming down here to take over
[36:30] this is more than a story this is you
[36:36] this is you are you willing to walk down
[36:40] to your egypt and say i have come to
[36:43] take over young people hopi but
[36:48] everybody here
[36:49] are you ashamed to walk back up in the
[36:52] pharaoh i say i sold out and the guy
[36:56] that i'm mad is a god that's with me
[36:59] this God told me I am the God of Abraham
[37:02] and Isaac and Jacob and I am come down
[37:06] to deliver my people I want to tell your
[37:10] parents God has not forgotten you Moses
[37:19] was not ashamed to walk in front of
[37:21] Pharaoh I said let my people but then
[37:29] Pharaoh wanted to offer
[37:30] Moses is so far religion that's exactly
[37:33] what the devil wants to do you I said
[37:35] loud now you go ahead and you worship
[37:36] your God go all the way out there but
[37:38] just go out there and take just take
[37:40] your women and your children believe
[37:42] your cattle here you'd go out there and
[37:45] you go you can go this far and I'll let
[37:47] you get out they did the same devil we
[37:51] face today young people
[37:52] well he'll offer you he will offer you a
[37:55] hand clapping he'll offer you a praise
[37:57] or he'll allow you to say Amen but he he
[38:00] wants to offer you that so far religion
[38:02] he
[38:03] not want you to go outside his walls but
[38:08] there's a mighty angel of deliverance
[38:10] coming down to take over he offered him
[38:14] a so far religion and Moses walked up
[38:16] before Pharaoh he wasn't ashamed to tell
[38:18] him that they
