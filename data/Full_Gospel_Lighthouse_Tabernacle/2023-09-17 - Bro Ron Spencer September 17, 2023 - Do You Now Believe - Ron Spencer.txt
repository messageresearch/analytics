puits had heart surgery this past week so just compl for complete healing for him and we would have an unspoken request he'd like to lift up to the Lord this morning I'm going ask brother Gabriel Spencer if he would just come lead us to the throne of grace this [Music] morning it's good to be here this morning a it I was able to talk to brother philli this morning and uh they're actually planning on discharging him either discharge now or here in a couple hours and um you know what he had was a what they would call the widows maker and God gave him purpose to live even even longer and I just happen to believe for him that God's going to allow him to see his son come back if you know anything about his story and may be bold of me to say that but I can say that because a couple years ago I I had prayed that I'd see my brother and his wife come back and I didn't know this until I just was walking in and in that testimony when I said that I said y'all will be able to believe what brother Ron came and told me when he stepped out right where you were sitting at and I was sitting there and he told me that Michael and Alexa are coming well they're here today so that can just be a confirmation maybe there's a lost loved one that you have believe we in for a special service this morning let's just take these needs to the Lord gracious Heavenly Father Lord you you know how to just orchestrate things so perfectly and be able to bring things together just so perfectly and Lord Jesus there's many needs in this building today Lord that many sick amongst us and Lord I just thank the the the physical needs that we have in our body you allow us to go through those things because if we if we were not sick if we wouldn't have conditions as our pastor has in cancer we wouldn't be able to see you as a Healer Lord Jesus we wouldn't be able to see you as a savior if we weren't born in sin and Lord Jesus I think about all the prodigals that you're bringing back home and all the conditions that all the conditions that are going on in this world that can drag us so far out that we there's no it looks impossible for us to come back it looks impossible for for anything to happen there's not one thing that we as men could say to our brother our sister or son or daughter but all we do is we just put our loved ones into the hands of you because it's in your time that these things will happen and they're they will turn around and they may not even understand how or understand why they're coming back to church but Lord Jesus it's because you're wrapping it all up your seeds are coming back into one Lord and I just ask that you would just sweep across this building this morning that this could just be a this could just be an everlasting Everlasting service that we will be able to look back unto in eternity and be able to say look at look at the loved ones that we've had that that we wrote down today that will be coming home and it's in our it's we have the power in our tongue to be able to claim and be speaking those things and Lord Jesus you've given us the authority to speak speak love you've given us the authority to speak speak healing over top of every situation and Lord Jesus I just ask that you would just come down in a mighty powerful way this morning you would be able to come down and you would allow us to draw closer we know that there's things in our own life that you're continuously working on we're not perfect but you make us perfect because we are in you Lord and I just ask that you would just come down in a mighty way and refill us with the Holy Ghost like never before and as each and every one of us are in this building this morning I ask that you will just be able to give us a special touch a confirmation to know that you are with us and you will draw us into eternity all the problems that we Face we don't need to worry about those they will be taken care of in due time we go through Seasons just so you can mold us and make us into the into the people you need us to be and that's that's only because one of these days you'll have to use us to help someone else Lord Jesus I just ask that you would just come and you would be with our pastor this morning anoint his lips anoint the service that you could just come and use him as a vessel use him as a mouthpiece to Proclaim Your Glory this morning and we just thank you for all that you are doing in Jesus name I pray amen and amen amen this time we receive this morning's offering you give as God's bless you after you've given you can be seated we

your nurse doing is he doing okay he's doing wonderfully amen amen amen you got a few moments I I want to share some things with you brother Nathan's been a buddy of mine since the 90s and and uh we had weightlifting in common we we enjoy we enjoyed weightlifting I don't look like a weightlifter today time and cancer takes care of a lot of things but there was a day that I benched almost 400 lbs and I squatted over 600 lb but there was nothing compared to this guy right here in 2017 you got a microphone I'm going to take you through an hour and a half testimony in 5 minutes if I can do that in 2017 what did we you were going through a prayer line can you share that with us well U about a week before the uh brother Ron came to our church we go to Brother Joseph Hamed's Church in Murphysboro Tennessee and our pastor Brother Joseph had handed out checks and brother Ron said you know y'all did that here one time with you know Jesus Christ from the bank Bank of heaven and you know you fill out the check and uh my wife had filled out the check for the Salvation of our children and U the next week brother Ron came and we was standing in the prayer line and and I went and before my wife and uh brother Ron you know prayed with me which me and him have been buddies for a while and we just was happy to see each other and so my wife came uh right after me and she mention she spoke to our pastor Brother Joseph and said that uh she said you remember those checks you give us you know I wrote on that check for the Salvation of my children and you know they were lost in sin and you know and uh so she'd mentioned that to him and then our pastor had leaned over and said something to brother Ron I don't know for sure what but and brother Ron you know uh when he kept my wife come forward he uh he said to my wife he said you know didn't God bring your husband back because cuz back in 2010 you know God had brought me back that's another long story but you know I was deep in sin and and she and I was about to get a divorce and you know because I was just a monster but you know God had a way of getting a hold of me you know it took a little time in prison and Federal Marshals but he got a hold of me but uh I uh but whenever uh he said to my wife he said didn't God you know bring your husband back didn't he put you back together you know he said there's you know nothing too hard for the Lord and then he he stepped back and he looked at her and he said uh you know I give you your children in the name of Jesus Christ and then he shook his head he stepped back and he said I didn't say that he did and so my wife had held on to that since 2017 and she told everybody that you know anything anytime somebody was mentioning about our kids she said well there coming brother Ron told me and well couple weeks ago my son here Reed Lord got a hold of him at a Waffle House said he s brother Reed to tell that story I'm sorry Reed hallelujah hallelujah why you got to do this to us stupid devil man I'm not good at this kind of stuff but like he said we we like to weight lift so uh one Friday morning I got up and I just thought it was going to be another big day in the gym you know and uh little did I know it was going to be something completely different and uh got out of the gym still had a feeling that something was going to happen and I called one of my buddies he didn't answer we usually go eat breakfast on Fridays Saturdays and uh so normal breakf breakfast spot I drove by and it was uh it was really packed so I said I'm just going to go to Waffle House and so I walked into Waffle House and U going to sit down at the bar because the place is full and uh there's a older gentleman walked in behind me and there was two seats in between me and he sits at one on one of the empty seats on the other side and behind him comes another another couple like I said the place was full so he looks at me and says uh would you scoot down so so they could sit down and um I was like man this old man isn't going to tell me what to do you know I just came out of the gym and uh I look back cuz I'm still I still got a little nice bone in me but I look back asked him if they needed to sit down and and they said no there's a booth about to come open so I just went back to drinking my coffee and kind of gave this older man the cold shoulder and uh he still tries to talk to me like I said I give him the cold shoulder then he starts talking about Fords which we're Ford people over here yeah but um that's how you get to heaven he said he drove us he said he drove a 73 Ford so I was like man I used to drive one of those and you know he just started talking about that and then uh another thing was he got his food before me so I was like oh man come on you know I walk in before him order and he gets his food before me too so but uh anyway he he looks at me and he says uh you know it's not a coincidence that you're you're here today or I'm here and U CU God knows it all you know he said it's not a coincidence you're here today and U he says do you know where you're going to go today if you die and I was like oh man I hear I've heard this so many times and so I just kind of look away and start eating and say uh you know that's kind of a complex question just continue to eat and then just something comes over me and I just start crying and I say you know man uh it's not a complex question I know where I'm going to go today and it's not going to be a very good place if I died right now and uh and he says I continue eating then he says brother you know that uh you only get so many chances of God knocking on your door and I've been in and out of church and I'll be honest with you that that was the third time that uh the good Lord has dealt with me and uh pretty sure three is a good number isn't it yeah that's right and uh he says uh he says you got this is your chance today he says you're going to make one of the biggest and most important decisions of your life and I don't say anything you know he gets up to walk out and I asked him his name or no he asked me my name and I tell him you know Reed ball and and then before he walks out say uh you know sir what's your name and and he looks at me and says you'll remember me by Rich in Christ is what he said his name was and he walks out the door turns around looks at me one more time and says I'll see you up there never seen him since and after that I just drive home just crying you know just asking Lord repenting asking you know what what what must I do and go home and uh I just I call it my pastor brother Donnie cuz I live in Johnson City and say I need to get baptized he says when son I say right now I don't know if I have an hour or you know a year or two left I just I just I want to do it now and he says well how long's the Lord been dealing with you and I say honestly brother Donnie he never stopped you know he said well that sounds like our God and I go go to his house and he has a pool there and I get baptized and uh nothing crazy happens you know I don't feel no no no crazy inside side of me and you know but whenever I got out of the pool and I started walking up as big hill I just realized that all my burdens and all the cares that I had before the worries and everything was just gone and I want to praise God for that and he's he's seen me through Elijah's 21 22 22 sorry it's a big deal big different but God did a work for him in his life and he was living in Johnson City with Reed and God began to deal with him and brother Tim PR if I can share this with you brother Tim PR his first service back back and and even brother Nathan fought you know I don't want him home he's messed up I don't want him in my life he's messed up he's you know he's doing a lot of bad things and these boys never realized six weeks ago doing drugs they'd be sitting on this pull pit today ain't God good and and so anyway his wife is and he gets a text while the sermon going forward and Brother Joseph hmed just begins to speak some things in Prophecy this boy comes home and brother Tim prit preaches the next Sunday and he hits repentance then the next Sunday brother Joseph hammed is up during the night all night kind of like I was last night all night and he said God God's dealt with me to preach repentance again and then at the end of the service brother Elijah walks to the off to the altar with his dad and brother and Brother Joseph said God showed me two boys that was coming to the Lord and brother Elijah gave his heart to the Lord

Jesus and she approaches him in the right way Lord if thou would have been us here my brother had not died that's incredible Faith but I know that even now what a statement even now whatsoever thou will ask of God God will give it thee and Jesus saith unto her thy brother shall rise again verse 34 and said where have you laid him and they said unto him Lord come and see and Jesus wept then said the Jews beholding how he loved him and some of them said could not this man which opened the eyes of the blind have caused that even this man should not have died Jesus therefore groaning in himself cometh to the Grave it was a cave and a stone lay upon it and Jesus said take ye away the stone Martha the sister of him that was dead said unto him him Lord by this time he stinketh for he had been dead four days and Jesus said unto her said I not unto thee that if thou wouldest believe thou should us see the glory of God then they took away the Stone from the place where the dead was laid and Jesus lifted up his eyes and said father I thank thee that thou has heard me and I knew that thou had heardest me always but because the people which stand by I said it that they may believe that thou has sent me and when he had thus spoken he cried with a loud voice Lazarus come forth brother brandom said had he not called him by name there would have been a general Resurrection and he and he that was dead came forth bound hand and foot with grave clothes and his face was bound about with a napkin and Jesus said unto them loose him and let him go what a powerful scripture let's talk to him Lord Jesus we love you today we thank you to be in your house one more time what an incredible opportunity that you give us to come and hear the words of the Lord come through the lips of man one more time now Lord it will go in many different places it'll go to many different Hearts now Lord you know exactly you know exactly how to deal with us today now now father I pray that you would send your word forth and may it live strengthen us today you know my own physical being the struggle that I'm in even in the last couple of days we ask you you that you would just come and give me strength anoint our lips and anoint our mind and anoint our vocal cords to speak the word now Lord I don't only ask for myself but I ask you to anoint this congregation May yesterday be over with May tomorrow be somewhere in the future but may we now catch this moment that we're in and may you call us by name and speak to our hearts in a special way we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen you can be seated brother random would tell the story it's been told many times there was a great circus that was taking place under a huge tent there was a man that was that was going to walk the high wire and he walked it backwards and forwards and as he did everybody was applauding and after a little while he begin to say he pulled out a wheelbarrow and he said how many really believe that I can take this wheelbarrow across this high wire and he begin to work the audience submit do you really believe do you really believe do you really believe and this one guy be to scream and he begin to scream I absolutely believe and he said well if you really believe get in the wheel barrel that's a catch 22 story do you really believe boy you're quiet do you really I'm not going to put you in a WHEB but do you really believe after everything that you have seen and everything that you have heard many of you have been here for decades you've heard some of the greatest sermons that's ever been preached some of the greatest men that's ever preached in SHO leather has came and preached to you but just to set an occupy time and to be entertained by it is not enough but do you really believe we're facing a challenge now more than facing cancer or facing job situations or facing your different difficulties of family life or economic situations we're facing a a graveyards where people have laid for maybe even couple thousand years decomposed bodies are now in to the gases do we really believe that the resurrection is Right upon us and they're standing just a half a step from us do we really believe that our gray hair and no longer need glasses and no longer need artificial limbs and all these different kind of things do we really believe that this message do we really believe that this message has the transforming power not just to live an overcoming life not just to help us to be good citizens of the kingdom of God not just to be moms and dads and have good children and have a good Community Church but do we really believe that in the moment of the twinkling of an eye this message has produced the quality and the character to put us there more than quotes more than books more than tapes more than pictures come on church more than just having a a Rah more than just emotions more than all of that but when it comes right down to it do we believe sometimes impossibilities are more than our minds can comprehend there's some boys sitting on this platform that a few weeks ago never thought in their wildest imagination first of all that they'd be in church second of all they'd enjoy it and then they would be here and then they would testify to the world of what God has done for them sometimes things seem like it's a dream or an impossible situation God takes impossibilities and makes realities out of it now let me just drop back and give you a few quotes here brother B says now let there be God spoke it and it began to materialize the very ground that you are set on here tonight is the word of God materialized did you know that of course we we knew that God just said it let there be and it was he believed his own word then he's almighty God and if he's almighty God he can do all things and if he cannot do all things he is an almighty God and if the scripture tells us that he is the same yesterday today and forever he says now in another place he said I'm so glad that Jesus left us a solid rock Foundation of his resurrection we don't have to wonder if it's the truth the amazing thing is that so many people doesn't see it he said I've wondered it tonight I'm going to try to approach it in the scriptures now if you would notice that these ones that was at the tomb I want you to catch these things these ones that was at the tomb early in the morning they met two men which were angels in and Shining apparel which said unto them that he that he was and he saidh seek ye the living oh yeah why seek ye the living among the dead and they had went to the tomb and found that he was not there and they asked this notable question why are you seeking the living among the dead and he said these things he told you when you he was in Galilee now watch what brother Adam does with that he said maybe you might just have read that over the top but let's just study that just for a moment that angel he said he told you those things when he was in Galilee and they didn't understand it why they didn't get it and here's another significance of it these ones who told him thus or told these disciples that was at the grave that they must have been with him in Galilee they knew what Jesus had told them before his crucifixion oh what a blessing you see those disciples didn't know that the Angels were there but they evidently was there because they said did not he tell you these things while he was at Galilee the angel was reminded him while you said in the meeting with him at Galilee they didn't see the Angels they didn't see the Angels you don't have to see them but they're here and that fulfills the scriptures that the angels of God are encamped about those who fear Him and what a great thing that it is to know tonight that right in this building there's angels of God standing in attention and they know every word that we say and everything that we do and here's the scriptural proof of it did not he tell you these things while he was at Galilee remember he told you those things remember oh what a marvelous word he said oh I I want to I want to capture this Oh What a Sad thing that's going to be for the Lost that after they have sealed their Doom after they've heard their last sermon to be over in a devil's hell lost and no chance at all to repent now notice these words to remember the opportunities that they've turned down amen you say unto me then preach pracher is there Remembrance in hell he said Jesus said there was that's right he was a rich man that lifted up his eyes in hell and saw Abraham and lius in his bosom and he said remember in your lifetime there is a remembrance in hell I want to just capture this before we go on for the Lost how a horrible thing that it would be to know that the great meetings that they set in and heard the mighty sermons of the anointed Ministers of God and not only that but see the anointed signs and wonders and God performed among the people and to remember all of these warnings and yet be lost why it would haunt them forever I'd like for that to stick with you if you can so many times we have funerals you go to funerals and you know a guy lives his life he never did want to serve God he never wanted to commit his life to God he never wanted to do anything for God but he dies cuz that what that's what we do without a Rapture that's what we do that's a reality but then a minister will stand in the in the at the podium and he'll put that guy in heaven well that man would be uncomfortable in heaven he never wanted to go I'm going to preach to you he never wanted to go his whole life and maybe spend his life giving excuses you got nobody to blame but yourself nobody to blame but yourself goddess had songs written to you he's he's had preachers to preach to you you made the choice don't blame me don't blame your wife don't blame your husband don't blame anybody but brother RNA had a bad life but you had an opportunity don't bypass your opportunity you may never get it [Applause] again you were going home to commit suicide walking your way home but God had different plans and look at his family amen thank you Lord look at his family what an opportunity what an opportunity I I you you told me something last night about when you were in prison can I can I relay that he was in a heavy security maximum security God you know God's not really even interested in your situation he's looking at your future and he finds all of his kids in trouble he's in prison I think in Texas he's in prison in Texas he's in a behind a glass with other people other other men and and the guy asked him about serpent seed what was the original sin in the garden and he says well it was sex he said do you know a man named William brandham well he grew up in that but listen he's a million miles from being converted and now he's being reminded about what he grew up in that man was in prison for something insignificant basically very rich man had just forged something shortened his name wound up in the passport now he's in prison he Saidi won't be here but a few days but I'm here for you the man before him was a believer that man gets dismissed he takes his place he's running from God the first shipment that came from anywhere not from his mom not from his dad not from anybody that's can to him nobody even knew he was there he gets a box of books Hallelujah serpent SE Church age [Applause] book months later he finds God let me to say this you God's determined to find his seed Hallelujah he's determined now you remember that we sitting here today are the very projected thoughts of God he just didn't think about the moon the stars and the Earth that was his first Bible but he had you in his mind before the foundation of the world now John 1 in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth but when the message came our messenger took us back before there was a beginning because that mystery had to be hid till this end time under the seals to where God could reflect who was in his mind and then he PRS to project his thoughts and God's watched over you since before the foundation of the world and even when Adam fell God just didn't throw the book Away but then he watches over you through all of your genetics and through all your DNA and I know you've heard this a thousand times but never forget where God has brought you from and you may say well brother Ron I've never seen a miracle you are a miracle to be sitting here you are a miracle some of you are one in a family and your family is dispersed in all kind of trouble and all kind of situations all kind of hor that you've went through and you know you could just write a book on the hor that you've saw and yet God held you he held you and you go well I don't know what held me I'll tell you what held you God held you a God that's rich in Mercy a God that watched over you put a protection around you put angels to watch over you just as much as God said let there be laying on the inside of you it laid dormant for a long time but all of a sudden a seed that God put there before the foundation of the world God begins to brood over that seed now no man can come to God unless the spirit of God draws him so God begins to brood over that seed he begins to watch over that now as our Story begins to to share with us that brother Brandon would tell us that that Jesus and Lazarus were friends even before and being friends John was baptizing and Lazarus took Jesus to be baptized no doubt they had had a lot of stories they shared together they enjoyed one another's company it was a place where Jesus could rest amen I personally would like to have a house to where that Jesus would enjoy coming to well brother Ron that was 2,000 years well let let me just bring it up a little bit maybe brother Brandon would enjoy coming and hanging out kind of like George and Hattie's house and you know he could tell squirrel stories and he could talk about different things just be down to earth maybe Charlie's house and you know just be down to earth maybe sitting in in Northern Canada having a fire and with a young preacher named Eddie and you know they're sitting there and one's taking a night watching the other one's the other one's sleeping and and he says Eddie go to sleep and he said I'll watch for a little while and then when he when he wakes him up brother Eddie said I got got up and I went over and sat where brother brandham was sat and he said brother brandham went down he went to sleep and he said I just knew I had stepped into a presence where the Prophet was talking to God and he'd been fellow shipping with that he would later tell us about a car going down the road and an angel drops in the car right how that that presence pressed him against the window he said I hear people say I've had experiences like that he said I tell you none of you've had an experience like that where that being is like that sitting in that car he said I when I finally looked at brother brandom said he was Ash and white and his beard was standing straight out said after a bit we spoke and he said every time he comes to me something good always happens and he said they were there to kill an animal and he said just down the road there stood that animal and brother Bram just kept driving he said brother Bram it's close enough it's close enough it's close enough he said when I got out of the car to shooting he said I literally had to look in the scope and try to find out where I was at on the animal listen that's that's almost impossible it's almost impossible to be able to drive up on an animal but because the presence in the car is greater than the creation I'm dropping these things for you just for a moment it's greater than your work life it's greater than your situation it's greater it's greater and he wants to experience how great he is you say brother Ron Waffle House God's not ashamed of Waffle House he'll find you in a bar joint worst fight I ever got in in my life worse was on a man called brother randam a false prophet it was not a good night amen what'd you do wasn't a good night for him no doubt this home was a place to where Jesus rested enjoyed himself but God knows all things now he's on a he's on a campaign Lazarus become sick don't get ahead of me larus become sick as he become sick they send word to Jesus no response even the disciples say you know should we go back maybe he goes on he even explains to him to them that he's only sleeping well they don't understand and he gets sicker and he gets sicker now you know this is what the the critics begin to get in now you know critics always come and so now he's he's he's getting sicker and you know he Jesus isn't coming he isn't coming you know people get an attitude then you know he's not coming he's right on time and so you know he's going away and going the opposite direction the way they think he should be going Hallelujah and he do now you know critic really turns up the the deal now he's dead he don't even show up for the funeral amen they wrap him they take him to the Grave they Place him in the grave they seal the grave with a rock then they hear that Jesus is coming well sure he's going to show up too late he's going he's going to comfort the family he's going to comfort them all right you can hear the critic boom well now he's showing up now he's showing up remember when brother Brandon was killing that 42-inch caribou and that Silver Tip grizzly bear how many believe that was a vision amen a vision become real that's right you know even even when brother bud is walking down off the hill after they've killed the 42in horns and measured it it's absolutely perfect they're walking down off of the hill and and the brother goes I don't see a bear for miles and I Can See For Miles he's a guide and brother brandom ask him says are you doubting the vision I'm going somewhere with these things now I'm kind of pulling different gears and he's asking him are you doubting the vision no I I'm not doubting the vision brother Brandon because what happened with my brother with the seizures I I I I'm I'm not doubting that Vision I'm not doubting but I can't see it it doesn't matter if you can't see it he's still the same Jehovah [Applause] Gyra and brother brandham kills this charging grizzly bear you can watch that on you Youtube get a good kick out of it people standing in front of a charging grizzly bear where our Prophet was standing in front of a charging grizzly bear and he shoots it with too small a gun with one shot but the vision said one shot so brother Brandon was trusting the same vision that squirrels came that a storm was out of existence he was trusting that voice that had always trusted whether in the pull pit with people and critics and everywhere never ashamed if brother he said if God spoke to him to go call George Washington and Abraham Lincoln I'd call the whole world but let me tell you even greater than that all of our loved ones are going to be called one of these mornings they won't come out in an old body they'll come out on and a young a young body because that's what the word said they would [Applause] do Lord if you would have been here my brother would not have died brother Bram says and when she got to him she approached him the right way she said give him the right side title Lord she didn't up braid him Lord if thou have been here my brother wouldn't have not have died oh my I can see him pulling his little tired body together and and he said she said if thou would have been here my brother would not have died but even now but even now whatever you ask God God will give it to you she knowed notice these words she know what the god of creation was she knowed he was the anointed Messiah she approached him in the right way upon her knees Lord if that would have been here my brother would not have died but even now whatever you ask God God will give it to you oh if I could only think of of that even now Lord whatever you ask God God will give it to you and he said I am the resurrection and the life no other man could ever say that I am the resurrection and the life do we believe that do we really believe that and he that believeth on me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die and he asked the question believest thou this and her response was yay Lord I believe that that you're the son of God that has come into the world and he asked her a real important question where have you laid him some of us were laying in denominational tombs some of us were laying in some really bad sinful situations we were wrapped up that's right now let's just let's just think just for a minute by the message message of the hour where was Lazarus at he was in a place called once he slipped from this realm of life he slipped into a place called Abraham's bosom and there was where the Old Testament saints were gathered that's right fellowshipping together conversating together can you imagine many of them were looking at the prophecy that was to come and look at at the prophecy to come maybe 800 years later thousand years later they died not being able to see that but they held on to that prophecy whether it's Isaiah or Jeremiah or Nehemiah or nahome they held onto the prophecy they held onto the word even though that their life expired and went into the dust of the earth even job would ask the question if a man die will he live again amen you know we we read in the scriptures about we read in the scriptures about resurrection of life and Resurrection the promise and and even even Abraham would be dealt with as we heard last night Abraham being turned young again and and Sarah be turned young again even to the point to where a king would so want her as his wife and I want to preach a sermon in a few weeks on the Dilemma that God puts us in amen and and and they are in this dilemma there's a reason why they had to find themselves there because there's an end time bride that there's a message that's going to transform them to meet the challenge of the hour you're not going to stay old you're not going to stay baldheaded you're not going to stay with cancer in your body that's not what you're rejected future [Applause] is brother Justin's a nor egg farmer but that's just life if he owned the biggest egg Farm in the whole state in the whole United States of America he owned it all and he missed what's God's doing here all the outside world the police world all of that's important in this natural life but it's not so important in that life brother Ron hurry up I got to go mow my grass really it's too dry to mow your [Music] grass brother Ron I I got a pot roast well I had one yesterday it was really nice had carrots had mashed potatoes they had gravy on top of it really nice wish you'd have been there wouldn't have had enough for you all but it was really nice but Ron brother Ron if you don't get done in 35 minutes my pot Ross is going to burn you should have turned it on a lower [Applause] setting right you learn a lot of things here but brother on I got all of these things to do we don't know what Lazarus did in his life you know there's not even a word it says what Lazarus did in his life what his jobs were but let me just say this that wasn't important he knew Jesus are you with me there was incredible millionaires that were here when John Wesley was here we don't know nothing about those Millionaires and what they did but we know where John Wesley's at let me just say when this layot of SE and age is over and we're in the Rapture what you're doing today in your work World won't matter too much it's just stuff it's just stuff but even in the stuff God can supply your need Reed is a young Christian Monday morning he's watching last week's service well as brother Andrew and brother William got blessed well I would say yes but I want to tell you something else he sitting watching the service on Monday in his truck it doesn't look like he's going to get any business today but he accepted the blessing he said you pointed your finger at [Applause] me and before the day was over his truck was full we own the cat God owns a cattle on a thousand hills he's got the greatest economy that there is you're God's children you don't have to beg borrow and steal you're his children do you now believe stop ringing your hands speak to your problem stop worrying speak to your situation last was no doubt was talking about you guys talk are talking about the prophecy I've lived with him he's here he's on the earth he stands maybe 5'9 probably doesn't weigh 150 PBS he looks old for his age kind of like brother Ron he looks old for his age he might go on to tell a few things like his first miracle there was a wedding took place they run out of wine you know for for the the community that was a big deal to run out of wine but I I was there and they brought it to him and asked him to bless it and he blessed it and when he blessed it that water was the best wine cuz he's the god of creation quit looking at your impossibility ities and believe you'll be well Sue you'll be well am this is just a trial you'll be well your children are coming children are coming do you believe do you believe do you believe and he's talking to them about what he's done and what he's done and what he's done forgive me but let me just go on a sideline here Elisha say I I think I've experienced something like that you know I asked Elijah for a double portion and I knew that that wasn't Elijah that was producing that that was God and if I could get that God to live on the inside of me I could not just have what Elijah had but I could have a double portion of it not more po more more powerful but I could have twice as much and I experienced it and even when I was getting ready to die lay on my my my deathbed the one short of the miracle took place but I died and no doubt I had a lot of critics God won't do what he said he'd do God won't y'all been preaching Rapture for 50 years y'all been preaching Resurrection forever are you just Building a Church no God's Building a bride he's just got to wait till these guys come home he'll not leave one can not leave one he's not interested in leaving one because when you realize that you're as Eternal as God is eternal he can never forget you hallelujah it's not I hope I hope I hope I hope I hope I want it I want I want it let me just say God cannot forget his [Music] [Applause] kids I've been asked about the statement that I've made here in other places your church is not alive get up and move I'm not just talking about dead churches of the message I'm talking about denominational systems come out of her my people I got scripture for that come out of her my people be not a [Applause] partaker don't waste your time if I be be guilty of that I pray that every message Church in the world gets filled with people full of the Holy Ghost I'm tired of dead beats I'm tired of people that are not committed I want people that are on fire full of passion driven driven committed believe this message with all of their High [Applause] that hurts people's feelings get over it start walking and praying for your empty pews and say God fill them with Lively [Applause] Souls hallelujah amen I've been preaching life for 40 years I'm not going to quit now I'm not going to settle for some little denominational whimy here brother Ron we need to quieten things down talk to the Angel that's doing the work don't blame me don't blame me these people are only happy because of what they came out of and what they was I'm thr I'm thrilled I once was a dope adic I once was a harer I once did a lot of things but God rich in [Applause] Mercy I never want to forget where God brought me from am brother Ron when we get on streets of go don't give me your excuses don't give me your excuses to wait it's actually offensive it's offensive to me you're sitting here to don't day and don't know God don't bypass your chance well brother Ron I believe well let me just say drunkers believe when I was doing dope I believe Jesus boys believed but when God comes and gets inside of you and you may not feel any emotion but you changed but after that you'll be refilled over and over and over again and you'll become a drunkard HL I promised myself I'd behave this morning I'm having trouble where have you laid him cuz he knew what was getting ready to happen he knew you were going to wle house before you chose it so he decided to meet you there he needed you you to go home because he had two servants that's going to preach to you one named Tim PR one named Joseph hman and now Ron Spencer and I'll be your buddy for however long he lets me be your buddy when you get when you have problems which you will we're going to always be here we're kind of like a compass amen we're kind of like a North star because Jesus is on the inside of us and when you get in trouble all you got to do is call text call text answer better to text than I do calls you know that Matthew your grandon ear to ear and Jesus begin to weep and they said well he's weeping because he was his friend they didn't know it Amen brother Tim PR preached in my mother's funeral and because the director said you've only got 45 minutes and we had a few speakers I told brother Tim I said can you give us 10 minutes I saw him set it on his on his computer 10 minutes I watched it click down to 9:59 he closed his computer it's done it's it can be done I have a license I'm the we're best friends but in that 10 minutes he said things that was so powerful I will never forget he said Jesus did not weep because they were friends he said he wept because he had to call him from where he was at back in into this world and he would get sick again and he would die again and he would have trouble again but he had to do it God bless you brother Tim he had to do it to show people who he was it won't be much longer and Jesus said roll away the stone now here comes the human element again Lord by now he stinketh how many of you sit in a in a pew where you're setting maybe you've been moved around a little bit today but where you're sitting and you hear the voice of a minister and the devil Whispers In Your Ear how many of you amen okay let's be honest now I I'll preach on Liars if you guys how many of you sat and listen to preachers and at the same time the enemy Whispers in your ear I thought I thought that would be a better rate cuz I didn't want to change the sermon I'm getting too late come on do you mean to tell me brother Ron I can be in the perfect will of God and the devil will steal that's exactly right but now he sth and she was right she was fundamentally right but Jesus had a future he had a future with Lazarus we're going to eat together this evening we're going to eat together this afternoon he going to be sitting at the table and there's going to be people come to to to to kill him again stupid people say stupid things and Jesus asked the girls roll away the stone well brother Ron we've heard that for we've heard that for years those women roll the stone away but have you looked at it in this context there was critics there was critics but now if they put their hands on that stone they're committed once they put their hands on the stone listen Jesus listen the same God had opened up a Red Sea the same God had taken Elisha and laid him in a tomb knowing he had one promise left and they throw a Dead Soldier in on top of we it and God raised that Soldier back up God will take care of his word you you don't have to fix it you don't have to make it happen us preachers don't have to make the Rapture happen we don't have to make the resurrection we just preach it we just say these Sons shall follow them that believe and we'll lay hands on the sick and God does the work we can't heal a soul amen you're committed when you put your hands on the stone because he asked them do you now believe now once you now believe now you're committed to it it doesn't matter if every critic in your family is in your ear here you're convinced now when you're convinced and it's sealed in your heart brother Steven every devil in hell every devil in hell can say everything that he wants to but you and God have had a conversation you and I had a conversation one time and she wasn't a Believer but God showed me she would be a believer and I told you something that look like an impossibility everybody can say well she's a real believer but you wasn't looking when we were looking oh anybody can Look Backwards say well God did that and God I'm talking about your future do you really believe that that going from these seats on to a rapture it's just a moment [Applause] away I need a shot I got a few more minutes to go here amen Lord Jesus could have spoke their problem out of existence but they begin to push imagine what the critics now thought Jesus is letting those two women two women push that huge Stone into place he was doing it for a purpose Jesus is letting his pride whip the devil in Le oia who brother Ron you in Russia it was behind the Iron Curtain in Russia they were this sit for the faint of heart but in Russia they were they were preparing a meeting they were beli preparing a meeting in a in a dark dark dark Church soldiers come in with machine guns said how many real believers do we have here in this building and people scattered they ran out the doors jumped out every place that they could jump out but about 15 stood there so is that it you ready to give your life yes we're give our life for this good we're Believers too it's kind of the same things happening here real Believers are going to take a rapture make Believers are going to give their life through the tribulation period you know sometimes we think well predestination is only for the bride God knows where everybody's going good bad and ugly they roll the stone away now they're identified with what he said because they believe with all their heart they're fully committed they're fully committed they believe the messages thus sayith the Lord and they're fully committed that there was a voice behind the voice brother R was only standing near when God did those things now we're standing near when God does these does these things do we really believe and so we push the stone away now the god of Two Worlds begins to call Lazarus and he says Lazarus come forth and in that realm Lazarus hears his voice I've been thinking about this all night was never a voice like his voice I heard it too amen I heard it high on drugs one night and the the bed was spinning like this and he spoke to me he said Ron where are you I said I'm a prodal away from home he said come home I stuffed all my clothes in a garbage bag and home I
