[47:25] this place.
[47:26] [Music]
[47:28] The saints of God, no matter what Satan
[47:31] tried to throw at you this week,
[47:34] you've come to the house of God, you've
[47:37] lifted up. You said, "I'm coming to
[47:39] exalt
[47:41] the name of the Lord Jesus."
[47:43] You can only imagine how mad that makes
[47:46] hell.
[47:48] You can just smile at hell right there
[47:51] and say, "Satan, no matter. You threw
[47:54] everything you had at me,
[47:56] but I love the Lord Jesus more today
[47:59] than I did yesterday." What amazing.
[48:02] There's no greater privilege than to be
[48:04] a Christian.
[48:06] Amen. Certainly good to be in the house
[48:07] of the Lord. And it's certainly good to
[48:09] see each and every one of you and our
[48:11] visitors. And it's certainly wonderful.
[48:13] We also have another visitor family in
[48:15] our church, Brother Andrew and Sister
[48:16] Katie Spencer. and their family. We're
[48:18] happy to have them back in the house of
[48:20] the
[48:24] Lord. Amen. Amen. I I know we've got to
[48:28] share them sometimes, you know, but
[48:30] we're always happy when they come back.
[48:32] And Brother Ron, you know, when our when
[48:34] our group gets back together, we
[48:36] certainly love them and uh feel like the
[48:38] whole family's together again. Amen.
[48:40] Amen. We certainly want to keep Sister
[48:43] Wanda and Brother Randy in our prayers.
[48:45] You know, you never know what life
[48:47] throws at you, but we're one big family.
[48:49] That's right. You know, and we're not to
[48:51] to throw pity parties for ourselves or
[48:53] for others, but we're as a family to put
[48:55] a shoulder to shoulder, and when
[48:57] somebody goes through something, you
[48:58] really put that person on your heart.
[49:00] You really get to praying for them and
[49:01] you pull for them. That's the greatest
[49:03] thing we can do. Yes, sir. Amen. Amen.
[49:06] If we'll just we'll just go to the word
[49:08] this evening, not keep you
[49:11] standing. If you'll turn with me, thank
[49:13] you, musicians. Well, is this microphone
[49:16] okay, brother Jeremy? Is it okay? We'll
[49:18] turn to Isaiah chapter 61. We'll read in
[49:21] several several places here. Isaiah 61
[49:23] and then we'll turn over to John
[49:32] 14. Pray something will be said tonight
[49:34] to encourage your hearts. Amen. Isaiah
[49:36] 61 verse1 we'll begin.
[49:40] The spirit of the Lord God is upon me
[49:43] because the Lord hath anointed me to
[49:45] preach good tidings unto the meek. He
[49:48] hath sent me to bind up the
[49:51] brokenhearted to proclaim liberty to the
[49:54] captives and the opening of the prison
[49:57] to them that are bound. Amen. And now in
[50:00] John chapter uh yeah John chapter 14:1
[50:03] 16 Jesus here speaking a very powerful
[50:07] of course every word he said was
[50:08] powerful but you know this is a very
[50:10] comforting scripture he says in verse 16
[50:13] and I will pray the father and he shall
[50:15] give you another comforter that he may
[50:18] abide with you forever
[50:21] even the spirit of truth whom the world
[50:23] cannot receive because it seeth him not
[50:26] neither knoweth him but ye know him for
[50:28] he dwelleth with you and shall be in
[50:31] you. I will not leave you comfortless. I
[50:36] will come to you. Amen. One last place
[50:38] to second Corinthians chapter 12. And
[50:41] we'll let you be seated. 2 Corinthians
[50:43] chapter
[50:43] 12 and verse 9. Paul's speaking here.
[50:47] He's gone. We know he's gone through so
[50:49] many trials of life. And he's struggling
[50:51] with all of his weaknesses and all of
[50:53] his trials. And he inquired about the
[50:55] Lord. Lord, why is it, you know, other
[50:57] people are getting healed and other
[50:58] people are getting great deliverances,
[50:59] but what about me? Amen. And God finally
[51:02] reveals to Paul his situation. And that
[51:05] gave Paul an entirely different view on
[51:07] his trial. And verse nine, and he said
[51:10] unto me, my grace is sufficient for
[51:12] thee, for my strength is made perfect in
[51:16] weakness. Most gladly, therefore, will I
[51:20] rather glory in my infirmities, that the
[51:22] power of Christ may rest upon me.
[51:26] Therefore, I take pleasure in
[51:27] infirmities, in reproaches, in
[51:30] necessities, in persecutions, and
[51:33] distresses for Christ's sake. For when I
[51:36] am weak, then am I strong. Let's all say
[51:40] that last part together. For when I am
[51:42] weak, then am I strong. Amen. and let's
[51:46] bow our heads and hearts to the Lord.
[51:48] Dear gracious heavenly father, we thank
[51:49] you for this opportunity Lord to come.
[51:52] We thank you Lord for your presence that
[51:53] we already feel. Lord, your children has
[51:55] come. They're ready to feed on the word.
[51:57] They've come ready to worship now Lord.
[51:59] And you've never disappointed us one
[52:01] time. We ask Lord that you open up the
[52:03] word to us. Encourage our hearts.
[52:05] Strengthen us Lord. You know what each
[52:07] and every one of us Lord are going
[52:08] through. May something be said tonight
[52:10] to strengthen your children. Draw glory
[52:12] from this service. Use me Father Lord. I
[52:14] just surrender myself to you as speaker.
[52:16] Father, I ask that the hearers surrender
[52:18] themselves that together we'll give you
[52:20] the praise, honor, and glory in Jesus
[52:22] Christ's name. Amen. God bless you. You
[52:24] may be seated. With the help of the
[52:26] Lord, I'd like to title this this
[52:28] evening perfect faith with a broken
[52:32] heart.
[52:36] Perfect faith with a broken heart. That
[52:39] can sound a bit
[52:41] contradictory because a lot of times
[52:44] when you have a broken heart, you feel
[52:46] very weak and exposed. You feel
[52:49] vulnerable. But if you if you notice the
[52:51] text that we took, Paul said that when I
[52:54] am
[52:55] weak, then I'm actually strong.
[52:59] We know and understand that a Christian
[53:01] walk is not a flowery bed of ease. Simp
[53:04] simply put in everyday term Christian to
[53:07] be a Christian is not for sissies.
[53:10] It's not for weaklings. It's not you
[53:12] know it it takes it takes the strength
[53:15] of God to stand against our day and age.
[53:20] Everything is a fight and a struggle. If
[53:23] you have joy, if you have the joy of the
[53:25] Lord tonight, it's only because you
[53:27] fought for it. If you've got peace
[53:30] tonight, it's because you fought for it.
[53:33] If you are enjoying a godly family, it's
[53:36] because you fought for it. Satan is not
[53:39] just going to lay back, Brother Gabriel,
[53:41] and let you just have a godly family.
[53:43] Let you have peace and joy in your home
[53:46] and love. You're going to have to fight
[53:48] for every bit of it. But see, people,
[53:51] they can look at you and say, "My, that
[53:53] brother and sister so and so, they're
[53:55] always happy. They're always on the
[53:57] mountaintop. They've got such a
[53:58] wonderful family." But they don't see
[54:00] the battle.
[54:03] They don't see the hours in prayer. They
[54:06] don't see the tears. They don't see the
[54:08] agony underneath that they had to go
[54:10] through to get it.
[54:14] A godly marriage is something that you
[54:16] have to fight for.
[54:19] So, if you want these things I
[54:20] mentioned, but you don't have them, then
[54:22] you've got to fight. I want to encourage
[54:25] you tonight to fight to possess it.
[54:28] That's right.
[54:30] Now, the prophet of God taught us a very
[54:32] important
[54:33] truth. We know that a big part of his
[54:36] ministry, especially at first, was the
[54:38] divine healing. He was sent, God sent
[54:40] him, gave him an angelic visitation to
[54:43] take divine healing to the peoples of
[54:45] the world. And he taught the people many
[54:47] times before he called the prayer line.
[54:48] He said, "Look," he said, "when you get
[54:51] prayed for, many times you'll actually
[54:53] get sicker."
[54:56] But he said that is actually proof that
[54:59] you are healed. But what happens is to
[55:02] the the the carnal mind and reasoning,
[55:04] you feel wonderful in the presence of
[55:06] God. Maybe a a deaf person can hear in
[55:09] the presence of God because the demon
[55:12] has no choice but to leave. But then
[55:13] when they go back out to their normal
[55:15] lives and they begin to all of a sudden
[55:18] they they can't maybe they've got to
[55:19] say, "What was that?"
[55:21] when they heard perfectly a few hours
[55:22] ago, they then begin to draw back and
[55:24] think, "My, I've lost my healing." And
[55:27] that's the time to stand strong.
[55:30] So, when you get prayed for or you get
[55:32] prayed over a situation in your life,
[55:36] and it gets worse,
[55:39] be encouraged.
[55:41] Don't be discouraged. I guess I lost my
[55:44] faith. I guess the preacher didn't have
[55:46] enough faith. I guess I wasn't anointed
[55:47] with enough oil. Have faith
[55:53] because many times when we are in a
[55:55] great trial, God will speak a promise
[55:57] over us and we receive the blessing of
[56:00] his presence. But then things get even
[56:02] more difficult.
[56:04] That's the time to believe
[56:08] because see, Satan would love to get you
[56:11] disappointed in God.
[56:13] Come on, buddy. God never disappoints.
[56:18] There is no disappointment in him.
[56:23] So you say why then preacher am I
[56:26] experiencing disappointment? Why is it
[56:28] that I have felt like I have such faith
[56:30] but then I come across a situation and
[56:32] all of a sudden I'm so discouraged. I'm
[56:34] disappointed. The disappointment is not
[56:36] in him or his promise. The
[56:38] disappointment is in your own
[56:40] expectation or your own human reasoning
[56:43] of how something should have come to
[56:44] pass. And when it don't work out that
[56:47] way, you begin to draw back.
[56:51] And the Bible says, "My soul has no
[56:54] pleasure in them that draws back."
[56:59] So the disappointment is in our own
[57:01] human. It's in our own humanity. That's
[57:04] what's disappointing.
[57:06] He's never disappointed me a day.
[57:10] Never once. Amen. But I disappointed
[57:15] myself many times.
[57:18] I've let him down many times. He hasn't
[57:21] let me down once. Do you see how where
[57:24] where that difference is?
[57:26] So, Satan would love to get you
[57:28] disappoint. Well, I got so disappointed.
[57:30] I believed God for this and it never
[57:32] happened. Remember when Jesus was on the
[57:35] earth and he was crucified? The
[57:37] disciples were so disappointed. That's
[57:39] right. Why? because they expected him to
[57:43] take the kingdom at that time. So it
[57:45] wasn't that Jesus did exactly what the
[57:48] word said he would do, but their own
[57:50] disappointment came when it didn't work
[57:52] out like they thought it should. That's
[57:54] the disappointment.
[57:56] But Jesus did. He was exactly on time.
[58:01] His ways are higher than ours.
[58:04] One day we'll know the whole story, but
[58:06] right now it just requires faith and
[58:08] patience.
[58:11] Brother M said a lily or any
[58:14] flower it's beautiful a morning lily or
[58:17] a rose the rose of Sharon's a beautiful
[58:18] flower while it's a living it's
[58:20] beautiful but to get the odor out of
[58:22] that to get a perfume it has to be
[58:24] crushed
[58:26] and they crush it and they squeeze the
[58:28] perfume out of it you know in the Old
[58:30] Testament in Exodus chapter 30 God gave
[58:32] Moses a certain recipe on how to do the
[58:34] incense in the tabernacle of
[58:36] witness and they were to take three
[58:38] spices is, if I'm pronouncing this
[58:41] correctly, stacked and on ania and
[58:45] galbonum. That's in Exodus 30:34. These
[58:48] sweet spices with pure frankincense of
[58:51] each there shall be a like
[58:53] weight. And thou shalt make it a
[58:55] perfume, a confection after the art of
[58:57] the
[59:00] apothecarity, tempered together pure and
[59:02] holy, and thou shalt beat some of it
[59:05] very small.
[59:08] They had to crush them herbs and the
[59:11] incense to get that smell out.
[59:15] This wasn't just a plugin for your
[59:18] house.
[59:22] This was a
[59:23] special This was a special smell.
[59:28] And God wanted it done a certain way. I
[59:30] want so much of this. I want equal
[59:32] amounts and mix it with frankincense.
[59:33] And I want you to crush it. And I want
[59:35] you to beat it very small and put it
[59:38] before the testimony of the tabernacle
[59:40] of the congregation where I will meet
[59:42] you. It shall be unto you most holy.
[59:46] Now watch verse 37. And as for the
[59:48] perfume which thou shalt make, you shall
[59:50] not make to yourselves according to the
[59:52] composition thereof. It shall be unto
[59:54] thee holy for the Lord.
[59:58] You couldn't make this for your own
[59:59] house. It was a divine recipe that God
[1:00:03] wanted them to make. And that whenever
[1:00:04] they would have burned this incense on
[1:00:06] the altar and it went up, it was it was
[1:00:08] worship unto God. Whenever you would
[1:00:11] smell that and the priest, they would
[1:00:12] smell that, it would remind them of
[1:00:14] worshiping Jehovah.
[1:00:17] It wasn't to go into the house,
[1:00:19] anybody's house. It was it was only for
[1:00:23] God.
[1:00:25] God wanted that incense to have a unique
[1:00:27] blend and smell where that smell would
[1:00:31] remind you of him.
[1:00:33] In Ephesians 5:2, this is in the Greek
[1:00:35] dialogue. It says, "And be walking in
[1:00:37] love, even as Christ loved us and
[1:00:40] delivered himself up for us, an offering
[1:00:43] in a sacrifice to God for a sweet
[1:00:46] smelling odor.
[1:00:49] Our Lord Jesus had to be crushed
[1:00:53] so that the sweetness of the Holy Ghost
[1:00:55] could be released so that we can then
[1:00:56] enjoy it." It's not just for the house
[1:00:58] of God. It is for your home. It's not
[1:01:00] just for you. It's for your family. It's
[1:01:01] for your children. even unto as many as
[1:01:04] the Lord our God shall call. That's
[1:01:05] right.
[1:01:08] When Jesus was born, they brought very
[1:01:10] similar things to him. Myrr
[1:01:13] and frankincense
[1:01:15] and he was crushed and beaten for a
[1:01:17] sweet smelling
[1:01:18] savor. Brother talks about the gold how
[1:01:21] the old in the Bible days they used to
[1:01:22] beat the gold until they could see the
[1:01:24] reflection. They would beat it to get
[1:01:25] all the dross out.
[1:01:27] And when and when when the beater could
[1:01:29] start seeing his reflection, he knew
[1:01:30] that it was about time. And sometimes we
[1:01:33] go through things and we just feel like,
[1:01:34] Lord, you've got to be seeing your
[1:01:35] reflection about now. I've been getting
[1:01:37] being on for a long time.
[1:01:41] So then God says, you know what? You're
[1:01:43] right. Let me flip you over.
[1:01:47] You still got some
[1:01:49] beating. You're always We're always
[1:01:52] ready in our humanity to come out of it
[1:01:54] way before it's time. Let's just be
[1:01:56] honest. That's right. But he knows he
[1:01:58] promised to never put more on us than we
[1:02:01] can handle. Amen. The prophet of God
[1:02:04] said in without money or without price,
[1:02:06] but when our Lord puts his chain of love
[1:02:08] around your heart and pulls you out from
[1:02:11] the ditch of sin, he heals every broken
[1:02:14] heart and takes away all the sin. And
[1:02:18] the bill is put in a sea of
[1:02:19] forgetfulness to remember against you no
[1:02:21] more. Come without money or without
[1:02:23] price. No matter how bad you're cut up,
[1:02:26] how bad you're bruised, how your what
[1:02:28] how your family has done or what you've
[1:02:30] done, there's no bill for it. He heals
[1:02:32] the
[1:02:33] heartaches, takes away all your sorrows.
[1:02:38] How many here has experienced a broken
[1:02:41] heart before?
[1:02:45] Not just hurt feelings, but an actual
[1:02:47] broken heart
[1:02:51] where where where you feel like you
[1:02:53] can't even express it
[1:02:56] because it's
[1:03:00] breaking. He's the healer of that
[1:03:02] tonight.
[1:03:06] You know, the prophet of God talks about
[1:03:08] the children of Israel when they were
[1:03:09] slaves. He said their hearts were so
[1:03:12] broken, they were beginning to cry out
[1:03:14] to God. And it forced God, brother
[1:03:16] Andrew, it forced God to a conference.
[1:03:20] When they were living good and
[1:03:21] everybody, all the Egyptians and all the
[1:03:23] Egyptian government loved Joseph and
[1:03:24] they knew Joseph and they respected
[1:03:27] Israel because of who Joseph was, things
[1:03:30] were going just
[1:03:31] fine. But when they then begin to be
[1:03:34] forced into slavery, right, and begin to
[1:03:37] be beat, they begin to cry out for the
[1:03:39] deliver. And the prophet said that that
[1:03:41] may that God was forced to a
[1:03:44] showdown. And I believe that your broken
[1:03:46] heart, your desperation and anguish can
[1:03:49] force a conference in
[1:03:53] heaven. In Psalm 147:3, he health the
[1:03:56] broken in heart
[1:03:59] and he bindeth up their wounds.
[1:04:02] Now we know that healing is based on
[1:04:04] forgiveness. Amen.
[1:04:07] So if natural healing is based on
[1:04:09] forgiveness, so is spiritual healing
[1:04:11] based on forgiveness. Amen. Broken
[1:04:14] hearts come in very many different
[1:04:16] avenues. Whether it's the loss of a
[1:04:18] loved one, whether it's terrible news
[1:04:19] from the doctor you get, or someone else
[1:04:22] can break your heart. Right? So before
[1:04:25] God can heal your broken heart, you've
[1:04:27] if someone else has broken your heart,
[1:04:29] you've got to heal and for or you excuse
[1:04:31] me, you got to forgive that person.
[1:04:33] That's right. for breaking your heart
[1:04:35] before you can expect God to heal your
[1:04:37] broken heart.
[1:04:39] You cannot bear the grudge of what
[1:04:42] someone else did to you and then expect
[1:04:44] God to heal your broken heart when
[1:04:46] you're harboring unforgiveness for that
[1:04:49] person.
[1:04:50] That's right, sir. Now, God understands
[1:04:53] a broken
[1:04:55] heart. David said, "The Lord is nigh
[1:04:57] unto them that are of a broken heart,
[1:05:00] and saveth such that be of a contrite
[1:05:02] spirit." That's right. The first one
[1:05:04] with a broken heart was God himself.
[1:05:08] That's right. Amen. When he did
[1:05:11] everything, right? He provided
[1:05:13] everything perfectly for Adam and Eve.
[1:05:16] What more could they want? They had
[1:05:18] peace. They had love. They had
[1:05:20] everything.
[1:05:22] And it still wasn't enough.
[1:05:24] When he got the news, that broke his
[1:05:26] heart. So God understands. Oh yeah.
[1:05:32] Abraham waiting
[1:05:34] 25
[1:05:36] years for a son. And that son comes and
[1:05:40] he begin and Isaac arrives and he's
[1:05:42] testifying and he's so happy and for
[1:05:44] years he's enjoying
[1:05:47] Isaac. But one day God asked him and
[1:05:51] says,"Abraham, I want you to take your
[1:05:53] only son.
[1:05:56] I want you to take your testimony.
[1:05:58] You've been believing me. Come on. For
[1:06:02] 25 years, right?
[1:06:05] How many here are under 25?
[1:06:11] That's longer. A number of you, that is
[1:06:13] longer than you've been
[1:06:15] alive. Abraham's been waiting. And God
[1:06:18] said, "I want you to take your
[1:06:21] son and take him somewhere where I told
[1:06:24] you in this mountain and I want you to
[1:06:26] sacrifice him to
[1:06:28] me." What do you think that did to
[1:06:30] Abraham's heart?
[1:06:33] It shattered it
[1:06:36] in so much that brother said he could
[1:06:37] even tell Sarah he didn't want to upset
[1:06:39] her. So he goes that morning and he
[1:06:42] starts splitting the wood and he get he
[1:06:45] brings a fire with him and he you know
[1:06:47] he saddles up the donkey and he gets
[1:06:48] ready and they get going all the while
[1:06:51] knowing right one thing that was missing
[1:06:54] from his journey there was he didn't
[1:06:56] bring a lamb
[1:06:58] he didn't bring a bullock he didn't
[1:06:59] bring a goat
[1:07:01] and as he's going up to the mountain you
[1:07:03] can imagine his what what his heart must
[1:07:06] have been feeling right
[1:07:08] when he was split splitting. The Bible
[1:07:10] said he cleaved the wood as he was
[1:07:12] splitting the wood and stacking it. This
[1:07:15] is going to burn my son.
[1:07:21] But he loved
[1:07:22] God more than anything else in this
[1:07:25] world.
[1:07:27] He loved God more than himself. Right.
[1:07:30] In Genesis 22:5, "And Abraham said unto
[1:07:33] the young man, abide ye here with the
[1:07:35] ass, and I and the lad will go yonder
[1:07:38] and worship and come again to you."
[1:07:43] No doubt Abraham didn't even understand
[1:07:45] maybe what he was saying. The
[1:07:46] inspiration so took him over, right?
[1:07:51] Al his heart in his throat, knowing he
[1:07:54] was about to take his son, right? But
[1:07:56] yet under the inspiration of the Holy
[1:07:58] Ghost, he says, "Y'all y'all hang out
[1:08:00] right here. We're going to go in this
[1:08:01] mountain and worship."
[1:08:04] And it's not I'll just be back. I and my
[1:08:07] son will be back. How?
[1:08:10] How, Abraham, are you going to bring
[1:08:12] Isaac back? I'll tell you how. The same
[1:08:16] way that a prophet of God said, "Bud,
[1:08:18] before we get to that camp, I'm going to
[1:08:21] kill a grizzly."
[1:08:23] How?
[1:08:26] When you go really high in the
[1:08:27] mountains, I've never been to that
[1:08:28] portion of Canada, but when we were in
[1:08:31] the mountains of Colorado, you go up to
[1:08:33] a certain point and it's timberline and
[1:08:35] things are and the weather is so extreme
[1:08:37] above that the trees don't even grow.
[1:08:38] It's almost like moss is almost like a
[1:08:40] like a carpet
[1:08:43] everywhere. And yet they they could see
[1:08:45] the camp of the boys and the prophet of
[1:08:47] God stands there in such confidence and
[1:08:49] says, "Before we get there, I'm going to
[1:08:52] kill something that you've never even
[1:08:53] seen in the area." Right.
[1:08:58] And Abraham took the wood of for the b
[1:09:00] of the burnt offering and laid it upon
[1:09:03] Isaac his
[1:09:05] son. And he took the fire in his hand
[1:09:07] and a knife, and they went both of them
[1:09:09] together. And Isaac spake unto Abraham
[1:09:11] his father, and said, "My father," he's
[1:09:13] getting suspicious
[1:09:15] here. And he said, "Here am I, my son."
[1:09:17] He said, "Behold the fire and the wood,
[1:09:20] but where's the lamb for the burnt
[1:09:22] offering? You need a lamb for a
[1:09:24] sacrifice.
[1:09:27] And Abraham again and Abraham said, "My
[1:09:31] son, God will provide himself a lamb for
[1:09:35] a burnt offering."
[1:09:38] Imagine what it made God feel like
[1:09:41] to sit down to to be to be there and to
[1:09:43] look down and to see that Abraham then
[1:09:46] began. He didn't carry the wood. He put
[1:09:48] it on Isaac. That's right.
[1:09:51] And then to be able to to to see a
[1:09:53] brokenhearted
[1:09:55] father. God could look down and see a
[1:09:58] brokenhearted father putting wood on the
[1:10:01] back of his son.
[1:10:06] That was years and
[1:10:08] years, like 1300 years before Isaiah
[1:10:12] ever pinned Isaiah 53.
[1:10:16] 2,000 plus years before God before or
[1:10:19] excuse me, yeah, before he ever came and
[1:10:21] gave his life and God looking down and
[1:10:24] seeing that.
[1:10:27] With a broken
[1:10:29] heart, but even in the state of his
[1:10:31] broken heart, Abraham had perfect faith,
[1:10:35] right? And that perfect faith aligned
[1:10:37] itself with the mind of God.
[1:10:40] And that's what perfect faith is.
[1:10:41] Because remember, perfect faith masters
[1:10:44] all circumstances.
[1:10:47] And whenever your thinking aligns with
[1:10:49] God's thinking, you've got perfect
[1:10:51] faith. Thank you, Lord. Amen. If you're
[1:10:54] looking at your situation and your
[1:10:56] symptoms, it's not lining up with what
[1:10:58] God said. That's right.
[1:11:04] Brother Ram said, "Now notice as they go
[1:11:06] up the hill, Abraham packing the fire,
[1:11:08] when they get up there, he said,
[1:11:09] 'Father," he said, "here I am." He said,
[1:11:11] "Here's the wood and here's the fire.
[1:11:13] Here's the altar, but where's the lamb
[1:11:14] for the sacrifice?" He said, "Oh, could
[1:11:16] you imagine the father's heart pumping
[1:11:19] hard, his only child? Where's the
[1:11:23] sacrifice?" Abraham choking back the
[1:11:25] tears. Think of your own self choking
[1:11:28] back
[1:11:29] tears with a stern look towards heaven.
[1:11:32] And he said, "My son, God will provide
[1:11:35] for himself a lamb for the sacrifice."
[1:11:38] And on tape, you can hear Brother Bam
[1:11:40] start getting real emotional. And he
[1:11:41] says, "I'm not emotional much, but that
[1:11:43] just gets to me.
[1:11:46] God will provide for himself a
[1:11:48] sacrifice, a lamb." He said, "Turn
[1:11:50] around, Isaac. Turn your back to me,
[1:11:54] son." He did. Isaac thought, "What's
[1:11:56] this?" It's leather cords taking my
[1:11:59] hands.
[1:12:01] Surely father understands what he's
[1:12:04] doing. Around his feet went some cords.
[1:12:06] Tie them together. He looked
[1:12:09] over. Abraham looked at him and brushed
[1:12:11] back the hair out of his eyes and kissed
[1:12:14] him on the cheek.
[1:12:18] You talk about a broken heart.
[1:12:22] God be with you, my son. Laid him on the
[1:12:25] altar, looked back, choking back the
[1:12:27] tears. Little Isaac, obedient to death.
[1:12:30] not asking a
[1:12:32] question. And as and as Abraham gets
[1:12:35] that knife out of the sheath and goes to
[1:12:37] plunge it into his
[1:12:39] son, the angel of God stops his hands.
[1:12:41] He says,"Abraham,
[1:12:44] Abraham,
[1:12:46] now I know you've proven to me that you
[1:12:49] love me above anything else.
[1:12:54] You've proven it." And then you watch in
[1:12:56] the scriptures, there comes a promise of
[1:12:58] I'll you know your your seed shall
[1:13:00] possess the gate of the
[1:13:04] enemy. Who was Isaac? Jesus.
[1:13:08] Who is the ram caught in the thicket?
[1:13:10] Jesus.
[1:13:12] Who took your place? Who took my place?
[1:13:18] Jesus when he was here on the earth, he
[1:13:19] said, "I no man takes my life for me.
[1:13:22] I've got power to lay it down. I've got
[1:13:24] power to raise it up. That's right. When
[1:13:26] it fell in line with the scripture to
[1:13:27] lay it down, he laid it down. When it
[1:13:29] came time in the scriptures to raise up,
[1:13:31] he raised up.
[1:13:33] He had all power. Pilot thought that he
[1:13:35] could let him go. Pilot thought that he
[1:13:38] had control. The Pharisees thought they
[1:13:41] were in control. The soldiers thought
[1:13:43] they were in control.
[1:13:46] Jesus went up. When Jesus, as Jesus went
[1:13:50] up, gotha hill, he's already seen this
[1:13:52] drama before. In his mind, in the type,
[1:13:56] he's already seen this drama before. He
[1:13:58] was just walking in it. He was just the
[1:14:01] anti-ype, the fulfillment of it. When
[1:14:04] Jesus was beaten, he was not beaten to
[1:14:06] say, "You go to the cross. No, I don't
[1:14:08] want to. We're going to beat you and
[1:14:09] make you." No, he was beaten to fulfill
[1:14:11] the scripture. But he gladly went up. He
[1:14:14] went up of his own will.
[1:14:16] Thank you, Lord. Think of the widow of
[1:14:19] Zerapath drought in Israel because of
[1:14:23] sin. Remember Elijah by the authority of
[1:14:26] God said, "Not even dew will fall till I
[1:14:28] call for it."
[1:14:30] He goes by the brooks, the crows feed
[1:14:32] him. And after a while, the brook dries
[1:14:34] up and then he says, God tells them in
[1:14:37] first Kings 17 n, "Arise, get thee to
[1:14:40] Zarapath, which belongth to Zidon, and
[1:14:42] there behold I have commanded a widow
[1:14:44] woman there to sustain thee." The widow
[1:14:47] woman didn't know that.
[1:14:49] She didn't get that memo yet. That's
[1:14:51] right. But in the mind of God, he knew
[1:14:54] what nature she had. You have Elijah,
[1:14:57] and she had the same nature Elijah had.
[1:15:00] So God sent knew exactly who to send his
[1:15:03] prophet to.
[1:15:05] So he arose and went to Zerapath. And
[1:15:07] when he came to the city, behold, the
[1:15:09] widow woman was there gathering of
[1:15:11] sticks. and he called to her and said,
[1:15:14] "Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water
[1:15:16] in a vessel that I may drink." Now,
[1:15:18] water wasn't common at that time.
[1:15:21] He already asked her a lot by asking her
[1:15:24] for water.
[1:15:26] But because she had the same nature,
[1:15:28] she's I'll go get it. And as she goes to
[1:15:31] get it, if that already request was not
[1:15:33] hard enough, her trial gets even harder.
[1:15:37] He says, "And and while you're there,
[1:15:39] before you do that, bake me a cake also.
[1:15:42] Amen.
[1:15:44] The trial just got harder. Not only does
[1:15:46] this man want the last bit or or my
[1:15:49] water, but now it's the last cake, the
[1:15:52] last
[1:15:55] piece. And he called to her and said,
[1:15:58] "Pray, bring me, I pray, thee a morsel
[1:15:59] of bread in thine hand." And she said,
[1:16:02] "As the Lord God liveth, I have not a
[1:16:04] cake, but a handful of meal in a barrel
[1:16:06] and a little oil in a cruise. And
[1:16:08] behold, I'm gathering two sticks.
[1:16:13] that I may go in and dress it for me and
[1:16:15] my son that we may eat it and die. That
[1:16:18] was their last meal.
[1:16:23] And you have a prophet of God asking
[1:16:25] her, "Go make me a cake
[1:16:28] first." Her heart was already broken
[1:16:31] from her only son begging her and asking
[1:16:34] her for food. Amen. No doubt they had to
[1:16:36] ration it. So they might not have eaten
[1:16:38] probably for a week or so or two or who
[1:16:40] knows.
[1:16:42] and he's crying all night for something
[1:16:45] to eat. What would that do to us as
[1:16:48] parents to hear your child, "Daddy,
[1:16:51] mama, I'm hungry." And you can't do
[1:16:54] nothing about it.
[1:16:57] Day after day, I'm hungry. I know,
[1:17:00] honey. I know. I know. It's We We're
[1:17:03] just going to pray that God will send
[1:17:04] rain. I know you're hungry, but we're
[1:17:06] We've only got one. We've really got to
[1:17:08] make this last.
[1:17:11] And when the day finally arrives, we're
[1:17:13] okay. This is our last meal.
[1:17:17] Maybe before we die, it'll rain. This is
[1:17:19] our last meal. There comes a bald-headed
[1:17:24] prophet, fuzzy with a long beard, and
[1:17:27] asks for her food.
[1:17:32] Her last bit.
[1:17:37] Now remember she couldn't bre said as
[1:17:40] certain as he is God he has to keep his
[1:17:42] word certain. Then the command was go to
[1:17:45] the city for I have commanded a widow
[1:17:46] woman a vision broke before the
[1:17:49] prophet. She doesn't know where the
[1:17:51] sticks will be laying but there's two
[1:17:53] sticks in the yard somewhere. Now notice
[1:17:56] there couldn't have been a bundle of
[1:17:57] sticks.
[1:17:59] She couldn't have went and gotten a
[1:18:00] bundle of sticks. There had to only be
[1:18:02] two because the cross has only got two.
[1:18:07] And she in her broken state did not
[1:18:09] realize the perfect faith that she was
[1:18:12] in. Her mind, her whenever she had that
[1:18:15] last meal, that meal was ground down
[1:18:17] just like Jesus Christ was ground down.
[1:18:21] And she walked out there and found one
[1:18:24] stick part of the cross. She gets
[1:18:28] another piece, a stick. And when she
[1:18:31] picked up that second stick,
[1:18:36] If she would have had a bundle of wood
[1:18:38] and she would have had plenty of food,
[1:18:39] she could not have expressed the mind of
[1:18:41] God.
[1:18:43] But yet, because her heart was broken,
[1:18:46] come on. See, whenever we're we're in a
[1:18:49] state where where we think we we're
[1:18:51] doing good and we feel strong, we feel
[1:18:53] good. We have all kinds of walls and
[1:18:55] fences up sometimes.
[1:18:57] But whenever you're so broken down
[1:19:01] where you can't even speak, he said, you
[1:19:03] just say, "God, just listen to my heart.
[1:19:07] You know how I feel right now. There's
[1:19:10] no
[1:19:12] pretense." And that's the state she was
[1:19:15] in. And she had to believe the prophet.
[1:19:19] The same
[1:19:20] God sent that
[1:19:23] prophet and said, "For thus sayeth the
[1:19:25] Lord, the meal, the barrel of meal will
[1:19:27] not run dry, nor the barrel of water go
[1:19:30] empty until the Lord God send rain upon
[1:19:32] the
[1:19:34] earth." So if that was with Elijah
[1:19:38] speaking here in verse 13, and Elijah
[1:19:40] said unto her, "Fear not. Go do as thou
[1:19:42] has said, but make me thereof a little
[1:19:44] cake first, and bring it unto me, and
[1:19:46] after make for thee and thy son." How in
[1:19:49] the world to the carnal mind can she
[1:19:52] make a cake after she gives Elijah her
[1:19:55] last one?
[1:19:58] But the same God that inspired Abraham
[1:20:00] to say that I and the lad will go yonder
[1:20:03] and worship and come again unto you.
[1:20:06] Amen. While he was on a mission to
[1:20:09] sacrifice him is the same God that told
[1:20:11] her you bake me your last cake first
[1:20:14] and you and your house will eat for many
[1:20:17] days. That's what the scripture said.
[1:20:19] After she did that, they were taken care
[1:20:21] of in the drought.
[1:20:24] He said, "This poor little woman, she
[1:20:26] knew that he was God." As the barrel
[1:20:29] went down, down, down. Circumstances got
[1:20:31] worse and worse all the time. But God
[1:20:33] was letting it get that way. He just
[1:20:35] loves to do that. He loves to put your
[1:20:37] faith to a test to see how you'll act on
[1:20:39] it. That's right.
[1:20:42] Let you be anointed and prayed for and
[1:20:45] then make you worse.
[1:20:49] This is heavy duty.
[1:20:53] Said, "Come on, Satan. Put on him on a
[1:20:55] test. I know he believes me. Bless God
[1:20:57] forever. Oh my. Put him to a test now. I
[1:21:00] know he took my word for it." Could he
[1:21:02] say that about you?
[1:21:06] That puts us all on the spot.
[1:21:13] The Shounomite woman was given a miracle
[1:21:16] baby
[1:21:17] boy. Years later, he
[1:21:21] dies and she goes and looks for that
[1:21:23] prophet
[1:21:25] Elisha. Now remember in 2 Kings 4:25, so
[1:21:28] she went and came unto the man of God to
[1:21:30] Mount Carmel. And it came to pass when
[1:21:32] the man of God saw her a far off, that
[1:21:34] he said to Gahesa, his servant, Behold,
[1:21:35] yonder is that Shounomite, run now, I
[1:21:38] pray thee, to meet her, and say unto
[1:21:39] her, Is it well with thee? Is it well
[1:21:41] with thy husband? Is it well with the
[1:21:43] child? Now listen, she had a dead boy
[1:21:45] back at home.
[1:21:48] Her husband was tore up. She was tore
[1:21:51] up. He had a broken heart. She had a
[1:21:53] broken heart. She was devastated.
[1:21:56] But yet, when Gahesa came and said, "Is
[1:21:58] all well with thee?"
[1:22:01] What was the what was that perfect faith
[1:22:02] come out and say all is well
[1:22:07] and she answered it is well perfect
[1:22:10] faith with a broken heart how can she
[1:22:13] say that because she has a faith that
[1:22:15] she now had arrived to God's
[1:22:17] representative on earth and she knew
[1:22:19] that if she made it to Elisha it was
[1:22:21] going to be well because the God that
[1:22:23] gives is the God that sustains.
[1:22:26] He's the God that gives. He's the God
[1:22:28] that takes away. But he's also the God
[1:22:30] that sustains.
[1:22:34] Glory to God.
[1:22:36] In the midst of the hardest trial of her
[1:22:39] life, she still was able to get that
[1:22:41] perfect
[1:22:43] faith. And the Shounomite woman said,
[1:22:45] she said, "All is well." Why? Her
[1:22:47] husband ringing his hands and screaming,
[1:22:49] all the relatives screaming and wailing.
[1:22:51] And she was there with a broken heart.
[1:22:55] the baby laying on the prophet's bed,
[1:22:57] dead, her only son, an old woman, an old
[1:23:00] man. How she loved that little fellow.
[1:23:04] She loved her baby like you do yours,
[1:23:06] like I do mine.
[1:23:09] But yet with a broken
[1:23:12] heart, she still found perfect faith.
[1:23:16] Because you know, Satan again, whenever
[1:23:17] you get that broken heart, he'll come
[1:23:19] and say, "This is why. This is why." and
[1:23:21] he'll begin to try and drive you down,
[1:23:23] drive you away from church, drive you
[1:23:25] away from your family, drive you away
[1:23:28] from God. When here in the scriptures,
[1:23:29] we're looking and that's when people
[1:23:31] stood firm and had perfect faith.
[1:23:34] That's when they took God at his word.
[1:23:39] So in verse 27, and when she came to the
[1:23:41] man of God to the hill, she caught him
[1:23:43] by the feet, but Gahesa came near to
[1:23:45] thrust her away. And the man of God
[1:23:46] said, "Let her alone, for her soul is
[1:23:49] vexed within her, and the Lord hath hid
[1:23:51] it from me and hath not told me." And
[1:23:54] then she said, "Did I desire, son of my
[1:23:56] Lord, did I not say, do not deceive me?"
[1:23:58] Then he said to Gahesa, "Gird up thy
[1:24:00] loins, and take my staff in my hand, in
[1:24:02] thine hand, and go thy way. If thou meet
[1:24:05] any man, salute him not. If any salute
[1:24:07] thee, answer him not again, and lay my
[1:24:09] staff upon the face of the child."
[1:24:13] because that prophet knew that
[1:24:14] everything he touched was blessed.
[1:24:17] Now, I want you to catch something
[1:24:20] here. In this Shounomite woman's
[1:24:24] pain, the the worst trial of her
[1:24:28] life, she inspired Elisha
[1:24:34] to tell Gahesa, "You take my staff and
[1:24:36] you go lay it on the child."
[1:24:40] Hundreds and hundreds of years
[1:24:43] later, Elisha inspired Paul.
[1:24:48] Amen.
[1:24:50] Seven churches later, church ages,
[1:24:55] Paul inspired a prophet of God.
[1:25:04] This is it,
[1:25:05] right? We have prayer cloths here.
[1:25:10] So many miracles were done by prayer
[1:25:12] cloths in brother Bram's meetings and
[1:25:13] sometimes he couldn't even he would just
[1:25:15] pray over entire bed sheets like this
[1:25:18] and they would cut them up in small
[1:25:20] pieces and send them out.
[1:25:23] The prophet of God said that they'll
[1:25:24] send out hundreds a day. He said if you
[1:25:27] can come into my office and just watch
[1:25:28] and kept the testimonies through these
[1:25:30] years I suppose you could have piled on
[1:25:32] this platform that's been healed just by
[1:25:34] sending out these prayer cloths like
[1:25:36] this.
[1:25:37] millions of them around and around the
[1:25:40] world. All because one woman
[1:25:46] was devastated with a broken heart.
[1:25:50] Come on. And she went to Elisha.
[1:25:54] And Elisha by the inspiration of the
[1:25:56] Holy Ghost told Gays to what to do with
[1:25:58] that staff. That's right. And another
[1:26:00] prophet picked up that that fire. And
[1:26:02] then brother Brandham did. And how many
[1:26:04] people have been healed by prayer cloth?
[1:26:05] That's right.
[1:26:07] All because of perfect faith with a
[1:26:10] broken heart.
[1:26:12] In the Old Testament on the other side
[1:26:14] of the cross, yet God is true to his
[1:26:16] word. Cancers and things falling off of
[1:26:19] people. I heard brother Bram not long
[1:26:21] ago on a tape say, "Now you get that
[1:26:22] prayer cloth you have in your pocket.
[1:26:24] Don't you let nobody touch it. You go
[1:26:26] home and lay it on the sick relative and
[1:26:29] they're going to be healed."
[1:26:32] The next time you you hear brethren talk
[1:26:34] about prayer cloths and he talks about
[1:26:36] praying over the handkerchiefs at the
[1:26:37] end of the service, you remember that
[1:26:39] Shunomite woman, you remember the cost
[1:26:41] of it
[1:26:44] and the benefit of people. Do you
[1:26:46] remember when brother Brandham was
[1:26:47] talking to that infidel and that woman
[1:26:49] that was supposed to die and she was on
[1:26:50] the bed pan and and she was cancer? Do
[1:26:53] you know she was healed by a prayer
[1:26:54] cloth? That's right.
[1:26:57] Because of this Shounomite woman.
[1:27:00] because of a broken heart. How many
[1:27:03] hearts have been mended because of her
[1:27:05] broken heart? Because of her perfect
[1:27:07] faith with her broken heart
[1:27:10] her heart herself got mended. Now
[1:27:15] now
[1:27:17] remember Gaza ran ran ahead and when
[1:27:20] Elisha came, he took that dead child and
[1:27:24] he laid it on the bed. Remember, she
[1:27:26] made him a separate room. And that
[1:27:28] prophet of God took him by the
[1:27:29] inspiration of God and he laid that
[1:27:32] little boy on his
[1:27:35] bed. And when he did that, he then laid
[1:27:38] on the child.
[1:27:40] His nose to his nose and his mouth to
[1:27:42] his mouth and his eyes upon his
[1:27:45] eyes. And he went and the child came
[1:27:49] back to life.
[1:27:51] Do you know that? That's exactly what
[1:27:54] Elijah did also.
[1:27:56] Do you know that when the that when the
[1:27:58] widow of Zerapath later in life her son
[1:28:01] also died and she went and laid him on
[1:28:03] the bed of Elijah and Elijah went and he
[1:28:06] laid himself on the child and the child
[1:28:08] came back to life and Elisha with a
[1:28:11] double portion of that same anointing
[1:28:13] went and he did the same thing. He put
[1:28:15] him on his bed. He laid down. Don't you
[1:28:18] know that Jesus said, "The works that I
[1:28:20] do shall you do also?" That Elijah is a
[1:28:24] type of Christ and Elisha is a type of
[1:28:26] the bride.
[1:28:28] And here you have Elisha with the same
[1:28:30] inspiration do the exact same thing.
[1:28:36] Both dead boys laid on the prophet's
[1:28:38] bed. Both prophets laid on the body on
[1:28:41] the boy's lifeless body. But the same
[1:28:44] need with the same faith
[1:28:48] in the same God
[1:28:50] produce the same results.
[1:28:54] That's Hebrews 13:8. Jesus Christ the
[1:28:58] same yesterday and today and forever.
[1:29:04] You had the same faith that she had,
[1:29:06] you're going to get the same results.
[1:29:08] All right. You may not have the same
[1:29:10] need she has, but if you've got the same
[1:29:12] faith because we're serving the same
[1:29:15] God.
[1:29:17] Has God lost his power?
[1:29:21] We're say we're serving the same God she
[1:29:23] did. We were sent Elijah just like she
[1:29:27] was sent Elisha. And Elijah
[1:29:40] Mary and
[1:29:42] Martha, they were real
[1:29:45] believers. They weren't ashamed of Jesus
[1:29:48] Christ. Jesus and Lazarus were like best
[1:29:51] friends. And when Lazarus got sick, they
[1:29:54] thought, "Surely, when you have a best
[1:29:56] friend, they're there for you."
[1:29:59] And here you have Jesus, one of Jesus's
[1:30:02] best friends get
[1:30:04] sick and they send him a message.
[1:30:07] Lazarus is sick. Could you please come
[1:30:09] and pray for
[1:30:10] him? And Jesus ignored
[1:30:13] it because Jesus already knew what was
[1:30:17] going to
[1:30:18] happen. Jesus purposely avoided coming
[1:30:21] back until Lazarus actually died.
[1:30:26] So you can imagine the disappointment
[1:30:28] and the heartache that struck that
[1:30:31] home. They could not understand here. We
[1:30:34] gave up everything that we have. We
[1:30:37] we've exposed ourselves. We've exposed
[1:30:39] our our reputation in the community to
[1:30:41] believe this
[1:30:43] message. And here in our darkest hour,
[1:30:46] Jesus would not come and pray for our
[1:30:48] brother, his best friend.
[1:30:51] You think you think they didn't have
[1:30:52] whispers of the devil going in their
[1:30:54] ears all the time because remember he
[1:30:57] was dead for so not only do they keep
[1:30:58] sending to Jesus and he wouldn't
[1:31:02] come but then when he actually he then
[1:31:05] waited Lazarus died they already had had
[1:31:07] you know Jesus didn't even come to the
[1:31:09] funeral and and you know where's this
[1:31:11] Jesus the neighbors you can imagine all
[1:31:13] all the
[1:31:14] whispering here they they left for this
[1:31:17] to follow this crazy man Jesus and when
[1:31:19] they need him the He's nowhere to be
[1:31:20] seen. What a miracle worker that is.
[1:31:22] Come on.
[1:31:24] So Jesus not only doesn't come, but he
[1:31:26] waits for 4 days.
[1:31:30] After the funeral, he's not there for
[1:31:32] another four
[1:31:35] days. And when Jesus finally comes back
[1:31:38] in John 11:20, then Martha, as soon as
[1:31:40] she heard that Jesus was coming, went
[1:31:42] and met
[1:31:43] him. But Mary sat still in the house.
[1:31:48] Now, I want you to watch this. Mary was
[1:31:50] so brokenhearted and she was so
[1:31:53] disappointed. She sat there in the house
[1:31:55] even though she knew Jesus came.
[1:32:01] They had friends there to comfort her.
[1:32:04] Mary Jesus is coming.
[1:32:08] Well, what's the point? He's already in
[1:32:09] the
[1:32:11] grave. Lazarus already died. And she
[1:32:14] sits there in the house. And Martha, and
[1:32:16] this is where Martha showed her true
[1:32:18] colors. She ran out to meet
[1:32:21] Jesus. And then Martha said to Jesus,
[1:32:24] "Lord, if thou hast been there, my
[1:32:27] brother had not died."
[1:32:30] If you would have only come, if you
[1:32:32] would have only respond, I wouldn't be
[1:32:34] sad right now.
[1:32:37] Brother Ram says the there's God's
[1:32:39] representative. Here's a brokenhearted
[1:32:42] woman. There's a dead man laying there.
[1:32:43] this brokenhearted woman with perfect
[1:32:46] faith.
[1:32:49] She's the weakest she's probably ever
[1:32:51] been in her life. Yes, she's able to
[1:32:53] exercise
[1:32:55] faith. Is coming recognizing this gift
[1:32:58] of God here, the son of God. Greatest
[1:33:00] gift to ever give to the world. Giving
[1:33:02] him his right title, giving him his
[1:33:04] right worship, saying, "I believe you're
[1:33:08] the son of God."
[1:33:10] And whatever you ask God, God will give
[1:33:13] it to you. Something's got to
[1:33:16] happen. She said, "Yes, Lord. I believe
[1:33:18] it. I believe that you're the son of God
[1:33:20] that was to come into the world." He
[1:33:22] said, "Where have you buried him?"
[1:33:27] What was Martha's testimony? I know that
[1:33:30] even now, whatsoever thou will ask God,
[1:33:35] God will give it to you. Right.
[1:33:38] She recognized the authority of who
[1:33:40] Jesus was. Even now, four days, four
[1:33:43] days gone, embalmed.
[1:33:48] His body in in in that area in that hot
[1:33:51] Middle Eastern environment already begin
[1:33:53] to decompose to be a bit graphic.
[1:33:56] But yet Martha could sit there with such
[1:33:58] faith and say, "Even now, Martha, how
[1:34:01] even
[1:34:02] now?
[1:34:04] Her heart is broken, but she says,
[1:34:08] "Lord, even now,
[1:34:12] no matter how long your child has been
[1:34:14] wewarded,
[1:34:16] no matter how long you've been sick, no
[1:34:19] matter what the doctor's ever told you,
[1:34:21] be a Martha tonight. Be a Martha and
[1:34:24] say, "Lord, it's been four years since
[1:34:26] my struggle. I've been in this fight for
[1:34:28] five years. I've been in this condition
[1:34:30] for 10 years. My child has been running
[1:34:32] from God for 20 years. I don't care. Put
[1:34:35] a number in there. But even now,
[1:34:39] whatever my faith, my perfect faith can
[1:34:42] align with your word, I can have it.
[1:34:49] Do you know that doubt is the only thing
[1:34:51] that stands between our request and it
[1:34:54] coming?
[1:34:57] We believe
[1:34:59] God and we're waiting on
[1:35:02] him and he heals
[1:35:05] us. Now, if someone's still fighting the
[1:35:07] sickness, that doesn't mean they have
[1:35:10] doubt. But we have to keep the faith
[1:35:13] until the full promise is done. Because
[1:35:15] let me tell you something, a Christian
[1:35:17] cannot die.
[1:35:19] A Christian cannot lose.
[1:35:25] Paul would did not lose when they were
[1:35:27] building the the chopping
[1:35:31] blocks. We
[1:35:34] believe we believe and know that brother
[1:35:38] Ron is healed.
[1:35:40] We believe and know that all these other
[1:35:42] cancer cases and not only the cancer
[1:35:44] cases but the different conditions and
[1:35:45] the different requests, Sister Sue is
[1:35:48] healed in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:35:49] Christ. But sometimes, you know, the
[1:35:51] body, the flesh always takes a while to
[1:35:53] catch up to the word.
[1:35:57] Look how long it took Abraham and
[1:35:58] Sarah's flesh to catch up with the
[1:35:59] promise.
[1:36:03] Because the in our bodies, we're still
[1:36:04] in the time
[1:36:07] element. So Martha told Jesus that even
[1:36:10] now whatsoever thou ask of God, God will
[1:36:13] give it thee. Right.
[1:36:16] And in verse 28, and when she had so
[1:36:18] said, she went her way and called Mary
[1:36:21] her sister secretly, saying, "The master
[1:36:23] is come and calleth for
[1:36:26] thee." As soon as she heard it, now it's
[1:36:29] Mary's turn. She arose quickly and came
[1:36:31] unto him. Now watch, let's get down to
[1:36:32] verse 32. Watch the words of Mary. Then
[1:36:36] when Mary was come where Jesus was and
[1:36:38] saw him, she fell down at his feet,
[1:36:40] saying unto
[1:36:41] him,"Lord, if thou hast been here, my
[1:36:44] brother had not died." She just repeated
[1:36:47] word for
[1:36:49] word what Martha had just told Jesus.
[1:36:52] Even though Mary sat in the house,
[1:36:54] Martha ran out and met Jesus. But what
[1:36:56] was it? They had the same grief.
[1:37:00] They had the same heartache. They both
[1:37:03] no doubt trusted that if Jesus would
[1:37:06] only come back, he would heal him, heal
[1:37:08] Lazarus. But they also had the same
[1:37:10] faith.
[1:37:13] They both had the same
[1:37:15] heartbreak. And they both had the same
[1:37:17] faith. They both had the testimony that
[1:37:20] even now whatsoever thou will ask of
[1:37:24] God, God will give it thee. And you know
[1:37:26] how the story
[1:37:28] ended.
[1:37:29] Lazarus, come forth.
[1:37:34] One day he's going to call our loved
[1:37:36] ones that died in him to come forth.
[1:37:41] And when he speaks that, it will be on.
[1:37:48] Hallelujah.
[1:37:50] When you see your loved
[1:37:52] ones, you know it's time.
[1:37:57] everything that you've held in
[1:37:58] everything that we've held in our hearts
[1:38:00] and everything that we've believed and
[1:38:02] held so dear and known to be the truth
[1:38:04] against all odds and all the critics and
[1:38:06] all these things. God's going to prove
[1:38:09] his word.
[1:38:11] The widow of Naine, she only had one
[1:38:14] son. She was already a widow. She lost
[1:38:17] her husband and now she lost her only
[1:38:21] son. And a funeral procession was going
[1:38:23] by one
[1:38:25] day and Jesus stopped the funeral
[1:38:30] possession. You think in them days they
[1:38:33] had the pull of of Bethesda there. She
[1:38:36] might try to get her son in
[1:38:38] there. When all hopes was gone, Jesus
[1:38:44] came. Jesus raised three people from the
[1:38:48] dead. He raised Lazarus.
[1:38:52] the widow of Na's
[1:38:54] son and Jeras's daughter. Three as a
[1:38:58] confirmation and a witness. Now, Jaras,
[1:39:01] he was a secret believer. Brother Ram
[1:39:03] called him a secret believer. He
[1:39:04] believed the message, but you know, he
[1:39:07] maybe studied Brother Bram's books in
[1:39:08] the office and didn't want anybody to
[1:39:09] know.
[1:39:11] You know, he might he might have slipped
[1:39:13] some some of Jesus's truths in his
[1:39:15] sermons, but he was real secretive about
[1:39:18] it because see, he had a position. Amen.
[1:39:21] He had a position in the church. He had
[1:39:22] a position in the community and he was
[1:39:24] trying to to guard it. But you know, God
[1:39:26] knew that the in there and you know
[1:39:29] behind Jeras, behind everything that he
[1:39:33] was, there was a predestinated seed in
[1:39:35] there.
[1:39:37] So he knew how to make it come out.
[1:39:41] Sometimes you pour water on a sea to
[1:39:43] make it come out. Sometimes you let the
[1:39:46] sunshine on it to come out. And other
[1:39:48] times you put some fire under it to make
[1:39:50] it come out.
[1:39:54] So in Jaras's case, he put some fire
[1:39:57] and he let sickness strike his home.
[1:40:01] So at first it's just a sickness. All
[1:40:02] right, let's call the doctor. I know
[1:40:05] Jesus is doing the miracles, but let's
[1:40:06] just call the doctor
[1:40:08] first. So he calls the doctor and tries
[1:40:11] to treat her. He keeps coming back. Is
[1:40:13] she getting a little better? Not yet,
[1:40:14] but we we we can try this and we can try
[1:40:17] that. He had
[1:40:19] options. But one day, his options ran
[1:40:22] out.
[1:40:24] One day, everything the doctor had, a
[1:40:26] God-scent doctor, everything he had, the
[1:40:29] doctor's medicine bag got empty. Dus,
[1:40:33] I'm sorry to tell
[1:40:35] you, I have given her everything I've
[1:40:38] got and everything I know, and there's
[1:40:41] nothing I can do for her. Just prepare.
[1:40:44] Prepare for the inevitable.
[1:40:46] That fire was starting to burn
[1:40:48] hot because Jaras knew in the back of
[1:40:50] his mind who he could go
[1:40:55] to. If the doctors could cure her, he
[1:40:58] could his faith could stay behind closed
[1:41:00] doors. But as soon as she was given up
[1:41:01] by the doctors, Jaras had to make a
[1:41:03] confession. Amen.
[1:41:06] So when she was finally given up, he
[1:41:08] couldn't wait no
[1:41:09] longer. In Luke 8:41, "And behold, there
[1:41:12] came a man named Jeras, and he was a
[1:41:14] ruler of the synagogue, and he fell down
[1:41:16] at Jesus's feet." Isn't that beautiful?
[1:41:20] He's a ruler of the synagogue, but yet
[1:41:22] he's so
[1:41:24] heartbroken and he knows who Jesus is
[1:41:27] that he falls at his feet in submission
[1:41:31] and worship and besought him that he
[1:41:33] would come into his house for he had
[1:41:36] only one daughter about 12 years of age
[1:41:39] and she lay
[1:41:40] dying. That'll make you desperate.
[1:41:45] And when he got, see, when he got to
[1:41:47] Jesus, he was
[1:41:50] relieved. He was relieved because, okay,
[1:41:52] I got to Jesus. He agreed to come back
[1:41:55] with me. Everything's going to be fine.
[1:41:57] It'll be okay. I'm walking with Jesus.
[1:42:00] He's right here. It'll be
[1:42:02] fine. And as he went, the people began
[1:42:04] to throng
[1:42:06] him. And a woman having an issue of
[1:42:09] blood 12
[1:42:11] years, which has spent all of her living
[1:42:14] upon the physicians, neither could be
[1:42:16] healed to many, came behind him, and
[1:42:18] touched the border of his garment, and
[1:42:20] immediately her issue of blood
[1:42:22] stenched. And Jesus said, "Who touched
[1:42:25] me?" When all denied Peter, and they
[1:42:27] that were with him, said, "Master, the
[1:42:28] multitude throng theemp and press thee,
[1:42:30] and sayest thou, who touch me?" Now,
[1:42:32] this is no accident here in the
[1:42:34] scripture. This woman's blood issue is
[1:42:37] connected to Jas's daughter. She had the
[1:42:40] blood issue for as long as his
[1:42:42] daughter's been alive. Think about that.
[1:42:44] She was 12 years old. And this woman was
[1:42:47] suffering with blood issue for 12 years.
[1:42:52] They both
[1:42:54] needed a touch in their blood. That's
[1:42:56] right.
[1:43:00] Now, in the Old Testament, like I said,
[1:43:02] they quickly embalmed the bodies for
[1:43:04] burial. So, Brother Ram said that the
[1:43:06] little girl Das's daughter was already
[1:43:09] inbalmed and ready for
[1:43:10] burial. Think of how final that sounds.
[1:43:14] It's one thing if if somebody drops, you
[1:43:16] know, drops dead and things like that,
[1:43:18] but then as as as the the funeral as as
[1:43:20] the body is prepared for burial, there's
[1:43:23] like a finality feel to it.
[1:43:27] And they had her prepared and laid out
[1:43:29] on the bed, no doubt waiting. Duras went
[1:43:32] to get Jesus. It was such an emergency.
[1:43:34] She couldn't even live till he got back.
[1:43:37] And they had already prepared her, ready
[1:43:40] for burial. But they wanted to give
[1:43:42] Jeras a chance to say
[1:43:45] goodbye. You think he had a broken
[1:43:49] heart? But in the midst of
[1:43:52] that, there was a woman that interrupted
[1:43:55] as it
[1:43:56] were, and came out and pressed through
[1:43:59] the crowd in faith and touched Jesus.
[1:44:05] And right on the heels of that miracle,
[1:44:07] as everybody's rejoicing, when Jesus
[1:44:09] found that woman, right on the heels of
[1:44:10] that miracle comes a messenger to Juras
[1:44:14] with ashes and sackcloth on his head,
[1:44:16] said, "Sas, don't trouble the
[1:44:19] master. She's
[1:44:21] dead. Your daughter's dead."
[1:44:24] You see how his trial got
[1:44:27] worse? Jaras's trial got worse. First,
[1:44:31] she was just really sick and now that he
[1:44:33] finally got to Jesus and he thinks it's
[1:44:35] over. He come back and then it gets a
[1:44:36] little worse.
[1:44:39] We've got to know where we're standing.
[1:44:44] Brother Ram says in the resurrection of
[1:44:45] Jas's daughter, "Well, Satan always does
[1:44:48] these things, you know, like this. And
[1:44:50] about that time, here come a little
[1:44:51] fellow perhaps with ashes on his head,
[1:44:53] which was a sign in those days. Don't
[1:44:56] trouble the master. Your daughter is
[1:44:59] already dead. Then the blow came. I can
[1:45:04] see little old Jaras's heart skip a
[1:45:06] beat. And he looked around and he
[1:45:07] started to scream. And he looked over
[1:45:09] towards Jesus. I can see him slowly turn
[1:45:12] his head.
[1:45:14] Don't fear.
[1:45:16] Only believe.
[1:45:22] He said, "That's all right." His heart
[1:45:24] started back beating normal
[1:45:28] again. Life doesn't always go like we
[1:45:30] want it to go.
[1:45:32] In fact, most of the time it doesn't. as
[1:45:35] a news flash to the young people.
[1:45:40] So we have to know and to
[1:45:43] understand that when life disappoints us
[1:45:47] and we don't always get the news and the
[1:45:49] results that we
[1:45:51] want. Let us look into the word and see
[1:45:53] the eyes of God looking back at us and
[1:45:55] saying
[1:45:57] don't doubt
[1:46:00] don't fear
[1:46:02] only believe.
[1:46:06] Now, it's a
[1:46:08] struggle. It's a
[1:46:10] fight. He said, "That's all right." His
[1:46:12] heart started beating back normal again.
[1:46:14] As long as Jesus said, "Only believe."
[1:46:15] That settled it with him. He knowed he
[1:46:18] was a believer. Straightened up,
[1:46:20] swallowed a few times, got his heart
[1:46:21] back in the right place, started walking
[1:46:23] on. Jesus said, "Didn't I say if you'd
[1:46:25] believe, you see the glory of God?"
[1:46:28] That's right.
[1:46:29] So, he goes to Jiraas's house, and you
[1:46:31] all know the story, most of you, and
[1:46:33] everybody's crying and just weeping and
[1:46:35] wailing and just having a having a
[1:46:38] time. And Jesus walks up to this little
[1:46:40] girl that's
[1:46:43] inbalmed and says, "Don't fear. She's
[1:46:46] only sleeping."
[1:46:48] And everybody be to mock and laugh and
[1:46:51] think he was crazy. And he put all that
[1:46:52] unbelief out.
[1:46:56] And he put them all out. Peter, James
[1:46:57] and John was there and he and the
[1:46:59] parents brother said he was with a
[1:47:00] brokenhearted parents and he takes her
[1:47:02] by the hand says made
[1:47:05] arise and her spirit came again and she
[1:47:08] arose straightway and he commanded to
[1:47:10] give her meat. The prophet of God said
[1:47:13] that he told her he told them to give
[1:47:14] her something to eat because she needed
[1:47:15] to get the blood going again.
[1:47:19] So remember the blood is made by the
[1:47:21] food that we eat.
[1:47:23] So, a
[1:47:25] supernatural situation happened there.
[1:47:27] And because she's still feeling a bit
[1:47:29] weak coming to herself, Jesus said,
[1:47:30] "Give her something to eat."
[1:47:33] An absolute miracle.
[1:47:36] I guarantee you, Jesus was no secret
[1:47:37] believer after that.
[1:47:44] Let God really do something for you.
[1:47:46] You're not going to be a secret believer
[1:47:47] anymore.
[1:47:48] Come on. Once you're with him, you can
[1:47:52] never be the same.
[1:47:55] God understands a broken heart. You
[1:47:57] know, G, he died from a broken heart.
[1:47:59] Jesus died from a broken heart.
[1:48:02] So much sorrow that his blood
[1:48:05] separated. You think about Mary, his
[1:48:08] naturally
[1:48:10] speaking, looking up at Jesus on the
[1:48:12] cross. Imagine what her heart felt.
[1:48:15] Remember whenever when Jesus when they
[1:48:18] took Jesus to the temple for the
[1:48:19] circumcision, Simeon prophesied and told
[1:48:21] her, "A sword will pierce through your
[1:48:23] own soul
[1:48:24] also." But do you know even in her
[1:48:27] broken heart, sin, you know, she she
[1:48:29] raised him, she took care of
[1:48:32] him when he got hurt, she was there for
[1:48:35] him.
[1:48:39] And yet she had to
[1:48:43] see Jesus get
[1:48:45] crucified. Not just die, but get
[1:48:48] crucified. The most horrible death
[1:48:50] laying hanging naked there on the
[1:48:53] tree. But do you know after Pentecost,
[1:48:56] Mary's heart was healed.
[1:48:59] She then understood why that had to
[1:49:02] happen. She had a broken heart for all
[1:49:05] them days, you know, for three days. She
[1:49:07] had a broken heart. She was carrying a
[1:49:08] burden. But when she seen her Lord and
[1:49:12] Savior, it wasn't her son.
[1:49:15] It was her Lord, her God, her Savior.
[1:49:18] And on the day of Pentecost, when she
[1:49:19] busted out of that upper room speaking
[1:49:21] in tongues and staggering and full of
[1:49:23] the Holy Ghost, you bet her heart was
[1:49:25] healed.
[1:49:27] He said, Brother Ram says, "Look at how
[1:49:29] beautiful my look at this. Christ among
[1:49:32] the sad and brokenhearted." That's where
[1:49:34] he goes amongst those that are sad and
[1:49:38] brokenhearted.
[1:49:40] They are were going along in the darkest
[1:49:42] hour they had ever seen. All their hopes
[1:49:44] were gone. They had been put out of the
[1:49:46] church, the synagogues, because they
[1:49:47] believed on him. And now he who they had
[1:49:49] trusted in was dead. And some women had
[1:49:51] come with a little story about some
[1:49:53] vision. They had seen some angels tell
[1:49:54] his disciples he would meet them in
[1:49:56] Galilee. They couldn't believe that.
[1:49:58] They were brokenhearted and sad crying.
[1:50:00] And there the lovely Jesus appears among
[1:50:03] the brokenhearted.
[1:50:06] Cleopus and his friends were so
[1:50:08] brokenhearted they couldn't they
[1:50:09] couldn't recognize Jesus.
[1:50:13] Don't let your broken heart and anguish
[1:50:15] of the trial that you're going through
[1:50:17] blind you from who's walking with you
[1:50:20] and who's talking with you.
[1:50:23] Trials can do that. You get in in a
[1:50:25] trial that's so heavy you feel like your
[1:50:27] eagle eyes are getting filmed over and
[1:50:29] you don't recognize that he has never
[1:50:32] left you
[1:50:35] because he's promised he would never
[1:50:37] leave you
[1:50:39] remember that dream that really famous
[1:50:42] dream about the footprints in the sand
[1:50:45] and that man whenever you know he asked
[1:50:46] God why is it I you know there were
[1:50:48] always two he was walking with Jesus
[1:50:51] along the the
[1:50:52] the shore and two sets of footprints and
[1:50:55] it was just it was wonderful being in
[1:50:57] the presence of Jesus. But then it just
[1:50:59] seemed like why did you disappear when I
[1:51:02] hit my hardest trial when I had my
[1:51:04] broken hearts? Every time in my life and
[1:51:05] I look back and my heart got broken here
[1:51:07] and my heart got broken here and my got
[1:51:09] my heart got broken here. There was just
[1:51:11] one set. Where'd you go?
[1:51:16] And God spoke back to him and said it
[1:51:18] was then that I was carrying you.
[1:51:23] See how that changes the focus instead
[1:51:25] of the victim mentality.
[1:51:27] God, why'd you leave me? He's never left
[1:51:29] you. He's carrying you.
[1:51:33] He will. He promised he would never
[1:51:35] leave you or he'd never forsake
[1:51:42] you. So, if you're here tonight with a
[1:51:44] broken
[1:51:46] heart in a hard trial of your life, let
[1:51:49] him carry you. Right.
[1:51:53] Have you ever tried to pick up a sizable
[1:51:55] child that you could hold, but at it was
[1:51:56] right at that age where if he didn't
[1:51:58] want to be
[1:52:00] held and you're trying to pick him up
[1:52:02] and he's trying to climb out of your
[1:52:03] arms and he don't want to be
[1:52:06] held, it's a
[1:52:09] struggle. So if if if God is trying to
[1:52:12] carry you and you think you can do it on
[1:52:13] your own and you can do it in your own
[1:52:14] will and let him carry you.
[1:52:18] Be like John. relax on his on his chest
[1:52:21] there.
[1:52:24] Quit climbing down out of your arms, out
[1:52:26] of his arms.
[1:52:29] There's parts of our lives here on the
[1:52:31] earth that are meant for only one set of
[1:52:34] footprints.
[1:52:38] There's times, Sister Cassie, he wants
[1:52:42] to carry you.
[1:52:45] Thank you, Lord. We need him to carry
[1:52:48] us. Amen.
[1:52:50] Amen.
[1:52:52] When you can't even whenever you're
[1:52:54] you're so broken or you're going through
[1:52:56] something, you can't even begin to
[1:52:58] express it in words. That's right. Have
[1:53:01] y'all ever gotten to a point like that?
[1:53:04] Where you feel so hurt or so broken or
[1:53:06] or something might have happened, you
[1:53:08] can't even
[1:53:09] hardly put a prayer into words.
[1:53:14] It is in them moments when God still
[1:53:16] knows how you feel. Amen. It's in them
[1:53:20] moments that he wants to hold you. When
[1:53:22] you're like, "God, I don't even know
[1:53:24] what to pray.
[1:53:26] I'm hurt and I'm broken and I don't know
[1:53:29] what to put into words, but you comfort
[1:53:32] me."
[1:53:35] He'll be there for you.
[1:53:38] The prophet of God went through some
[1:53:39] heartbreak
[1:53:42] in the life story.
[1:53:45] He's he's he's in prayer and he says,
[1:53:47] 'Oh God, have mercy. I just think back
[1:53:49] across the streaks of tears and
[1:53:51] heartaches and troubles, oh father, and
[1:53:53] I'm ashamed of all my life. Why didn't I
[1:53:56] know you before? And I've tried with all
[1:53:58] my heart, dear Jesus, to live for you,
[1:54:00] to do the thing, no matter what this
[1:54:03] cross is or how scornful it seems to be.
[1:54:06] He says, "I love you, dear Jesus."
[1:54:11] He said, 'You've broken my heart over
[1:54:14] and
[1:54:18] over. I thought God was a God of love.
[1:54:22] He
[1:54:24] is. He wants to express himself to you
[1:54:27] as such. He wants to express himself to
[1:54:30] you as a comforter. He said, "You've
[1:54:32] broken my heart over and over, but I
[1:54:35] love you for it."
[1:54:38] Can you testify that even though your
[1:54:40] heart's been broken and God has allowed
[1:54:43] you to come through things, you would
[1:54:45] not be who you are today if it would not
[1:54:47] have been for the heartbreaks you've
[1:54:48] experienced.
[1:54:52] It's not Paul said, I I you know, I um
[1:54:55] the sufferings of this present world, I
[1:54:56] reckon that the sufferings of this
[1:54:58] present world are not even worthy to be
[1:55:00] compared with the glory which shall be
[1:55:03] revealed.
[1:55:04] We think the trials are hard on us and
[1:55:06] they are. But God's after something.
[1:55:08] He's trying to to get that sweet
[1:55:10] smelling savor.
[1:55:12] And when you start smelling like him
[1:55:16] and you you begin and we begin to to
[1:55:18] portray the spirit of Christ, then that
[1:55:21] begins to please him.
[1:55:23] When we begin to display despite our
[1:55:25] broken heart, we begin to display
[1:55:27] perfect faith and say, "God, I don't
[1:55:29] care what happens. This this is breaking
[1:55:32] my heart. this situation, this battle
[1:55:33] I'm going through is breaking my heart.
[1:55:37] But despite of all that, you've allowed
[1:55:40] it to come my way, and I still love you.
[1:55:44] In Psalm 42, as we begin to close, as
[1:55:47] the heart panteth after the waterbrooks,
[1:55:49] so pantth my soul after thee, oh God. My
[1:55:53] soul thirsteth for God, for the living
[1:55:55] God. When shall I come and appear before
[1:55:58] God? My
[1:55:59] tears have been my meat day and night.
[1:56:05] Heartbroke. While they continually say
[1:56:07] unto me, there's your critics. Where is
[1:56:09] thy God? If you're such a Christian, why
[1:56:12] are you going through this?
[1:56:16] They continually say, "Where is your
[1:56:18] God? Why haven't you gotten healed yet?"
[1:56:21] Why are you still in that trial? You
[1:56:23] must be a secret sinner. They don't
[1:56:25] realize that with every word they're
[1:56:26] saying, brother Ron, they're heaping
[1:56:28] condemnation on themselves.
[1:56:34] Verse four, when I remember these
[1:56:36] things, I pour out my soul in me, for I
[1:56:38] have gone with the multitude. I went
[1:56:40] with him to the house of God with a
[1:56:41] voice of joy and praise, with the
[1:56:42] multitude that kept holy day. Listen to
[1:56:44] this. Why art thou cast down, oh my
[1:56:48] soul?
[1:56:50] Hope thou in God, for I shall yet praise
[1:56:55] him for the help of his countenance.
[1:57:00] Oh my God, my soul is cast down within
[1:57:02] me. Therefore will I remember thee from
[1:57:04] the land of Jordan and of the Hermanites
[1:57:05] and from the hill miser deep calleth
[1:57:08] into the deep at the noise of thy water
[1:57:10] spouts. All thy waves and thy billows
[1:57:12] are gone over me. Yet the Lord will
[1:57:14] command his loving kindness in the
[1:57:16] daytime, and in the night his song shall
[1:57:18] be with me, and my prayer unto the God
[1:57:21] of my life. I will say unto God, my
[1:57:24] rock, why hast thou for me? Why go I
[1:57:26] mourning because of the oppression of
[1:57:28] the enemy? As with a sword in my bones,
[1:57:31] mine enemies reproach me, while they say
[1:57:33] daily unto me, where is thy God?
[1:57:38] And David says again and closes out with
[1:57:40] this. Why art thou cast down, oh my
[1:57:45] soul? And why art thou disquanted within
[1:57:48] me? Hope thou in God for I shall yet
[1:57:52] praise him who is the health of my
[1:57:55] continents
[1:57:57] and my God.
[1:58:00] Brokenness puts us in a position to be
[1:58:02] remolded.
[1:58:04] Thank you, Lord.
[1:58:06] When you feel like you can't go on
[1:58:08] anymore, you're then in a position for
[1:58:10] God to start putting his fingerprints on
[1:58:12] you.
[1:58:14] One day, God spoke to Jeremiah and said,
[1:58:16] "Go down to the potter's house."
[1:58:19] And Jeremiah, following the word of the
[1:58:20] Lord, goes down the potter's house and
[1:58:21] he's watching the
[1:58:23] potter. And the potter how he's breaking
[1:58:25] it down and he's remaking it. And God
[1:58:29] gives him a message to Israel from that
[1:58:32] event. That's right. How many events did
[1:58:34] the prophet of God go to and see, you
[1:58:36] know, a big metal workshop, all of a
[1:58:37] sudden see a great magnet go and pick up
[1:58:39] all the shavings, but some were bolted
[1:58:41] down. Michelangelo's statue.
[1:58:46] He was there examining the art and got a
[1:58:49] powerful sermon out of it. Amen.
[1:58:54] Weeping may endure for a night, but joy
[1:58:58] cometh in the morning. Let's stand to
[1:59:00] our feet. Amen.
[1:59:03] Psalm 126:5, "They that sew in
[1:59:06] tears shall reap in joy.
[1:59:10] Harvest time is coming."
[1:59:13] All the tears and all the prayers that
[1:59:15] you put in for your loved ones and for
[1:59:17] your healing. It's coming.
[1:59:20] Our healing is already paid for
[1:59:24] without money, without price. It costs
[1:59:27] him everything.
[1:59:30] But all he asks us to do is believe.
[1:59:34] And we believe. You remember when when
[1:59:36] brother Ram had that stomach condition,
[1:59:38] he would be confessing that he's healed
[1:59:41] while he was vomiting.
[1:59:46] That's why
[1:59:48] Christianity, God doesn't want cowards
[1:59:50] in his army. He wants rugged believers.
[1:59:54] The world could could look at us
[1:59:56] brothers and you sisters and be like,
[1:59:58] "Oh, you know, they they you know, who
[2:00:01] do they think they are? Oh, they're
[2:00:02] just, you know, they're not tough
[2:00:04] because they won't smoke." Or, you know,
[2:00:06] your your friends may try and give you
[2:00:07] peer pressures. Well, if you are tough
[2:00:08] and you are a man, you do
[2:00:11] this. It takes a thousand time percent
[2:00:15] of a man, I don't care how young you
[2:00:17] are, to stand there in the face of peer
[2:00:19] pressure and say, "I won't take my first
[2:00:21] puff." That's right. That's right. I
[2:00:23] won't take my first drink,
[2:00:25] sisters. I won't snip my hair.
[2:00:30] You stand
[2:00:33] there against the onslaught of the
[2:00:35] devil,
[2:00:38] and the ransomed of the Lord shall
[2:00:41] return and come to Zion with songs and
[2:00:45] everlasting joy upon their
[2:00:48] heads. and they shall
[2:00:51] obtain joy and
[2:00:53] gladness and sorrow and sighing shall
[2:00:57] flee
[2:00:59] away. That's a promise of the
[2:01:03] Lord. And God's here. If you have a
[2:01:06] broken heart and you're just going
[2:01:07] through the deepest, darkest trial,
[2:01:10] we've just looked through the scripture
[2:01:12] and went through multitudes of examples
[2:01:14] and it could have went on and on. You
[2:01:16] think of Job whenever his heart broke,
[2:01:19] he heard it that one of his children
[2:01:21] died or or his animals died. Then it got
[2:01:23] worse. Then it got worse and then it got
[2:01:27] worse. And then when he really needed
[2:01:29] comfort, his friends came
[2:01:32] and it got worse. They got harder. But
[2:01:35] one
[2:01:36] day, joy came for Job.
[2:01:41] In the midst of his trial, in the midst
[2:01:45] of his broken
[2:01:46] heart, Job had perfect
[2:01:49] faith. And I pray that the Lord Jesus
[2:01:52] Christ, if you're going, like I said,
[2:01:53] through the darkest trial, you've been
[2:01:55] you feel like God is not hearing your
[2:01:58] prayers, I want to encourage you to stay
[2:02:01] on the battle line. All right. Don't
[2:02:05] draw
[2:02:06] back. You stay there and you keep
[2:02:09] confessing. Sister Sue, you keep
[2:02:11] confessing every
[2:02:13] day. I am healed. He is my healer.
[2:02:19] Sister Wanda, every day he is your
[2:02:22] healer. Brother Ron, every day he is
[2:02:25] your healer.
[2:02:27] [Music]
[2:02:29] Brother Bill, he is your healer. Sister
[2:02:31] Teresa, he is your healer.
[2:02:34] Brother Davey, he is your healer.
[2:02:37] If you want peace, claim it and then
[2:02:40] fight for it.
[2:02:42] If you want joy, claim it and fight for
[2:02:44] it. If you want the baptism of the Holy
[2:02:47] Ghost, claim it and walk in it.
[2:02:54] It's here for you.
[2:02:58] The same faith in the same God will
[2:03:02] produce the same results.
[2:03:06] God bless you tonight.
[2:03:13] [Music]
[2:03:19] Pieces. You touch my heart and made it
[2:03:24] new.
[2:03:30] Oh now my whole life I surrender. Oh lay
[2:03:35] it down before the mener. Oh Lord I give
[2:03:41] my life to you.
[2:03:49] Love the S before I knew
[2:03:56] you has brought me near to where you
[2:04:04] [Music]

[2:04:10] live to praise
[2:04:13] you. Whoever may I praise you. You're
[2:04:18] the healer of my
[2:04:22] heart. Oh, you are the
[2:04:29] healer. Oh, the healer of my heart.

[2:04:53] Oh, I was the
[2:05:00] broken, vessel in your
[2:05:06] hand. You looked beyond the hurt and
[2:05:12] made me
[2:05:14] whole
[2:05:19] again. Healer of the broken. Oh healer
[2:05:23] of the
[2:05:25] broken
[2:05:30] pieces. You touched my heart and made it
[2:05:36] [Music]

[2:05:47] Lay it down before the men. Oh Lord, I
[2:05:52] give my life to you.

[2:06:09] knew has brought me near to where you
[2:06:19] are. Oh, now I
[2:06:23] live to praise you.
[2:06:27] Forever may I praise you for you're the
[2:06:32] healer of my heart.
[2:06:36] Healer, oh healer of the
[2:06:41] broken
[2:06:44] [Music]
[2:06:46] pieces. You touch my heart and make me
[2:06:51] new.
[2:06:52] [Music]
[2:07:02] Pray now before the
[2:07:06] member Lord I give my life to you.
[2:07:16] Oh, love the song before I
[2:07:22] knew
[2:07:25] you has brought me near where you
[2:07:35] are. Oh, now I
[2:07:39] live to praise you.
[2:07:43] Ever may I praise you. You're the healer
[2:07:49] of my
[2:07:51] heart.
[2:07:52] Hallelujah. And
[2:07:54] pass me
[2:07:57] not. Oh
[2:08:00] gentle.
[2:08:04] Say oh.
[2:08:08] Oh,
[2:08:10] hear
[2:08:12] my
[2:08:14] heart.

[2:08:57] I'm
[2:08:59] crying
[2:09:01] [Music]
[2:09:06] save.
[2:09:14] [Music]
[2:09:19] Oh,

[2:09:41] others thou are
[2:09:46] called holy.
[2:09:51] Oh, do
[2:09:54] you do not
[2:09:58] pass
[2:10:00] me
[2:10:03] by? Well, every time I try to make it on
[2:10:08] my own.
[2:10:12] Oh, every time I try to stand and start
[2:10:18] to
[2:10:20] fall. Oh, all those lonely roads that I
[2:10:27] travel
[2:10:30] on. Oh, there was Jesus.
[2:10:36] [Music]
[2:10:41] Oh, with the life I built came crashing
[2:10:46] to the
[2:10:49] ground. Oh, with my friends I had
[2:10:55] nowhere to be
[2:10:59] found. Well, I couldn't see them, but I
[2:11:05] can see it now.
[2:11:09] Oh, there was

[2:11:16] Jesus. Hallelujah.

[2:11:45] where I'm
[2:11:47] going, even when I didn't
[2:11:52] know. Oh, could
[2:11:55] see. Oh, there was Jesus.
[2:12:02] Oh, for this man who needs amazing kind
[2:12:08] of
[2:12:09] [Applause]
[2:12:10] grace. For forgiveness at a price I
[2:12:17] couldn't
[2:12:18] [Music]
[2:12:20] pay. Well, I'm not perfect. So, I thank
[2:12:25] God every day.
[2:12:28] [Music]
[2:12:30] Oh, there was
[2:12:33] Jesus. Thank you, Jesus, for being
[2:12:36] there.

[2:12:59] [Music]
[2:13:00] Every
[2:13:01] minute, every moment of where
[2:13:05] I'm where I'm
[2:13:08] going. Even when I didn't
[2:13:13] know
[2:13:15] it. Oh, there was
[2:13:20] [Music]
[2:13:22] Jesus. Hallelujah.
[2:13:26] Oh, there was
[2:13:36] Jesus. Oh, in the
[2:13:39] waiting, in the search, in the healing
[2:13:44] and the
[2:13:46] hurting, like a blessing buried in the
[2:13:51] broken pieces.
[2:13:56] is every
[2:13:58] day, every moment of where I've been and
[2:14:03] where I'm
[2:14:04] [Music]
[2:14:09] going. I couldn't see
[2:14:13] it.
[2:14:14] There was
[2:14:19] [Music]
[2:14:21] Jesus. And
[2:14:23] we
[2:14:25] exalt
[2:14:29] thee.
[2:14:31] We
[2:14:34] exalt
[2:14:38] thee.
[2:14:40] We
[2:14:42] exalt thee.
[2:14:45] [Music]
[2:14:55] Oh. Oh.
[2:14:58] We
[2:15:00] exalt
[2:15:05] thee. We
[2:15:09] exalt thee.
[2:15:14] Oh,
[2:15:16] we
[2:15:19] [Music]
[2:15:23] exalt.
[2:15:25] Oh
[2:15:28] Lord. Hallelujah.
[2:15:31] You know, in 2012, there was there's a
[2:15:35] story about a man that had painted this
[2:15:38] beautiful picture of Christ.
[2:15:41] And in 2012, there was a man that made
[2:15:43] an unauthorized restoration to this
[2:15:46] beautiful picture of
[2:15:48] Christ. After he got done with it, they
[2:15:51] began to call it the beast Jesus or the
[2:15:54] monkey
[2:15:56] Christ because he completely to their
[2:16:00] eyes disturbed the entire
[2:16:03] painting. Didn't even look the same. But
[2:16:07] from that time, that little bitty city,
[2:16:10] they held that piece of art in their
[2:16:12] home, in their
[2:16:13] hometown. And from then on, people begin
[2:16:17] to flock to that community to see that
[2:16:19] picture of Jesus. Over $50,000 a year of
[2:16:23] a little bitty hometown was paid in
[2:16:26] tickets just to get in there and see
[2:16:28] that that
[2:16:30] painting. Sometimes there will be people
[2:16:32] that are gathered around you. They may
[2:16:34] not look like that God put you back
[2:16:36] exactly the way he wants you, but the
[2:16:39] world is saying that God is the God of
[2:16:41] restoration.
[2:16:43] Aren't you thankful that when you go
[2:16:45] through the worst of it, he is the
[2:16:48] healer of the broken pieces? Amen. Why
[2:16:52] don't you give our Lord a hand clap of
[2:16:53] praise
[2:16:53] [Applause]
[2:16:57] tonight? My wonderful, Brother William.
[2:17:00] Absolutely
[2:17:02] wonderful. We'll just sing that song as
[2:17:04] we're dismissed
[2:17:06] today. Amen. God richly bless you as you
[2:17:09] go in the name of the
[2:17:11] Lord.
[2:17:13] We
[2:17:15] exalt
[2:17:17] [Music]
[2:17:20] thee.
[2:17:21] We
[2:17:24] exalt thee.
[2:17:29] Oh,
[2:17:30] we
[2:17:33] exalt
[2:17:37] thee,
[2:17:39] oh Lord.
[2:17:44] [Music]
