[48:31] you God bless you this morning amen if
[48:34] you'll turn with me to St John chapter
[48:36] 17 and verse
[48:44] one John chapter 17 and verse
[48:50] one when I announce my text this morning
[48:52] don't think that I'm preaching for my
[48:54] last time
[48:58] but the Lord dropped this in my heart on
[49:00] the way home Sunday last
[49:04] Sunday last
[49:08] time my mother used to say that to me
[49:14] sometimes I'm going to tell you for the
[49:16] last time
[49:19] yeah I'm going to beat you for the last
[49:23] time
[49:27] and then I thought my Daddy really was
[49:30] it was going to be my last time it
[49:33] didn't hurt me it didn't hurt me and
[49:37] maybe that's not your political view but
[49:39] you probably needed it yourself and
[49:40] didn't get as much as you needed and
[49:43] so that's what's wrong with our
[49:45] generation
[49:47] now
[49:49] amen St John chapter 17 and verse
[49:54] 1 and these words SP Jesus and lifted up
[49:58] his eyes to
[50:00] heaven and said
[50:02] father the hour is
[50:05] come glorify thy son that thy son Also
[50:09] may glorify
[50:11] thee as thou has given him Power Over
[50:14] All
[50:16] Flesh that he should give eternal life
[50:19] to as many as thou has given
[50:23] him and this is life eternal
[50:28] that they may know the only true God and
[50:33] Jesus Christ whom thou Hast
[50:36] sent I have glorified thee on the earth
[50:41] and I have finished the
[50:43] work which thou
[50:45] gavest to me you may be
[50:55] seated I just want to share this just to
[50:58] to
[50:59] maybe be an encouragement to those that
[51:03] suffer
[51:04] sickness and as many of you know that we
[51:08] are fighting stage for cancer and just
[51:11] had a massive heart attack and then we
[51:14] fight another killer called diabetes and
[51:17] in my diabetes that that I struggle with
[51:20] is my pancreas doesn't work and
[51:24] so and so it uh it was killed by the
[51:28] steroids and the and also the the
[51:32] chemotherapy heart attack was also
[51:35] caused by the chemotherapy so we just
[51:38] kind of walk a very fine
[51:40] line and and I just want to say this to
[51:42] you and I've not said it in this way but
[51:46] it's not something that I worry
[51:50] about it's not something that I lay
[51:53] awake at night thinking of my final end
[51:56] this scripture says that
[51:59] precious a death of a saint is precious
[52:02] in the eyes of the Lord and so what that
[52:05] scripture tells us is your final hours
[52:10] are guarded by the angels of
[52:14] God you cannot go a minute early or a
[52:19] minute
[52:24] late are you with me Stonewall Jack
[52:26] Jackson sat on his horse and on his
[52:29] saddle and right in the midst of a bit
[52:32] and he he they would ask him how do you
[52:35] have that kind of a confidence and he
[52:37] said I'm a safe on the battlefield as I
[52:41] am at home on my
[52:45] pillow now sometimes people take one
[52:47] little pill and it worries them
[52:48] absolutely to death I take 30 every
[52:52] morning
[52:59] and I'm not even
[53:01] concerned say why brother Ron I'm safe
[53:04] in his
[53:06] hands and so when I speak to you this
[53:09] morning on last time don't think for a
[53:12] second that I'm thinking this is going
[53:14] to be my last
[53:15] [Music]
[53:17] sermon can I just get that done real
[53:20] quick and so you don't sit there and get
[53:23] cold on me
[53:24] [Applause]
[53:29] I had to drop that right there before I
[53:31] didn't want nobody get any kind of
[53:33] Illusion here I'm thinking I'm going
[53:36] home well when I go home don't you be
[53:38] crying for
[53:39] me I'm going to be more alive there than
[53:42] ever before and so brother renom would
[53:45] call you as the Bride of Jesus Christ
[53:49] the final
[53:52] Voice final voice to the final age we
[53:56] realize that we're right at the end you
[54:00] a drunk can see this we're at the end of
[54:03] all
[54:05] things we realize that we're literally
[54:08] on the precipice of the tribulation
[54:11] period blending over with what we see
[54:14] now we're in the age of Le oosa where it
[54:17] is a age of people's rights it's an age
[54:20] of expressing one's opinion it's an it's
[54:23] an age of political values all over the
[54:26] place but it's also an age where there's
[54:29] a bride of Jesus Christ that's getting
[54:35] ready so we realize these moments are
[54:38] joining together and we're literally in
[54:41] a in a junction and so as we would say
[54:45] and we say it many times don't miss
[54:50] it whatever you do don't miss it we
[54:55] realize that time
[54:57] intercepts with
[55:00] prophecy God causes men to rise and he
[55:03] causes them to
[55:04] fall whether it's Kings or potentates or
[55:07] popes on the scene many times we say
[55:11] well we vote them in or this one was
[55:13] selected God causes men to
[55:18] rise and he causes men to
[55:21] fall you can read the book of Daniel
[55:24] that points that out we realize realiz
[55:26] that we're under the pressure of the
[55:28] darkness of of this age and the pressure
[55:31] of almost a chaos but in the middle of
[55:34] all of this chaos God's Diamonds shine
[55:38] throughout the
[55:41] darkness we are not disappointed we're
[55:44] not disillusioned we've heard a
[55:48] message and this message is not just to
[55:51] America it's all over the Earth so it's
[55:54] not just a little bit group of
[55:58] people but there's a bride all over the
[56:02] earth that is gathered to hear his voice
[56:05] what I find it's very interesting is
[56:08] that no matter where you go the nature
[56:11] of the people have the same that it is
[56:14] right here so the Holy Ghost is not an
[56:17] American holy
[56:19] ghost or a Russian holy
[56:23] ghost or a European Holy Ghost ghost now
[56:27] we realize there's people that are more
[56:30] more vocal or more lively or quieter but
[56:35] it's the same Holy
[56:38] Ghost now we realize that this this is
[56:41] not an accident that you just fall into
[56:44] it understand that you being here and I
[56:47] know you fight the enemy but you being
[56:50] here that you're a literal physical
[56:54] thought or an act attribute of God that
[56:57] he thought up before the foundation of
[56:59] the
[57:04] world are you with me so when Satan
[57:07] tells you God don't love you remind him
[57:10] of where God thought of
[57:12] you before there was ever an earth or a
[57:15] sun or moon and stars God thought of you
[57:21] then so when God thinks of you he don't
[57:24] unthink of you
[57:28] that doesn't give us a license to live
[57:30] any way that we want to live that gives
[57:33] us
[57:35] confidence that we can live in the
[57:37] wickness of Ages and still
[57:41] overcome
[57:43] [Applause]
[57:45] Hallelujah it incredible we can still
[57:50] overcome no matter what is against us no
[57:53] matter how much pressure it is against
[57:55] us God has a prepared and equipped
[58:02] you I love that don't you Psalms chapter
[58:06] 27 and verse
[58:08] one the Lord is my light and my
[58:10] salvation and Whom Shall I
[58:13] Fear the Lord is the strength of my life
[58:16] of whom shall I be afraid when the
[58:19] wicked even mine enemies and my foes
[58:21] Came Upon me to eat up my flesh and
[58:24] stumbled and they stumbled and fell
[58:26] though a host should encamp against me
[58:28] my heart shall not fear though War
[58:32] should arise against me in this will I
[58:35] be confident what an incredible
[58:37] statement
[58:40] Wars
[58:43] th troubles on every side but in this
[58:47] will I be
[58:48] confident one thing that I have desired
[58:50] of the Lord that I will seek after that
[58:53] I may dwell in the house of the Lord all
[58:55] that days of my life to behold the
[58:58] beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his
[59:00] Temple read this next verse with me for
[59:03] in the time of trouble he shall hide me
[59:07] in his Pavilion in the secret of his
[59:10] Tabernacle he shall hide me and he shall
[59:13] set me upon a
[59:17] rock oh what a rock that it is Isaiah
[59:21] chapter 53 and verse 5 I want you to
[59:25] read this with me
[59:28] too but he was wounded for our
[59:33] transgressions he was bruised for our
[59:36] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[59:39] was upon him and with his stripes we are
[59:46] [Applause]
[59:54] healed oh don't you love it we realize
[59:58] that we have arrived at the end time
[1:00:01] bride's Revival is continuing to go on
[1:00:05] and it cannot be stopped it's been since
[1:00:08] the days of Acts chapter 2 in the period
[1:00:11] of of the pillar of fire came amongst
[1:00:13] the church and all the ages could not
[1:00:16] stop the
[1:00:17] Revival because it was Christ walking
[1:00:20] through the candlesticks what God starts
[1:00:24] no devil in hell can
[1:00:27] stop there's not a devil that's big
[1:00:30] enough to stop what God starts and if I
[1:00:34] can say that about you what God placed
[1:00:36] on the inside of you is part of
[1:00:39] himself and there's not a devil in hell
[1:00:42] big enough to stop the god that is
[1:00:45] inside of
[1:00:46] [Applause]
[1:00:51] you
[1:00:52] Hallelujah if I can say this greater is
[1:00:55] he that is in
[1:00:57] you go ahead and point it right there
[1:01:00] this is not about your 200 lb flesh or
[1:01:03] 6' five flesh or 5 foot five
[1:01:06] flesh or 110 pounds I'll find you
[1:01:09] somewhere another it's not about your
[1:01:12] flesh or your feelings or your memories
[1:01:14] or your affection it's about that
[1:01:16] Eternal part that he put in you before
[1:01:19] the foundation of the world that seed
[1:01:21] Gene of life that God put there God's
[1:01:24] Got Confidence in what he deposited on
[1:01:27] the inside of you it will not
[1:01:39] fail governments can
[1:01:43] fail Wars can cause
[1:01:46] failure schools can fall apart churches
[1:01:50] can fall apart but the seed of God that
[1:01:53] he put on the inside of you has got
[1:01:56] failure anywhere inside of
[1:01:59] [Applause]
[1:02:09] it when I speak about last
[1:02:13] time God writes it in his prophetic
[1:02:16] word but Satan cannot open up the word
[1:02:20] and reveal it to
[1:02:23] himself he he can see it
[1:02:26] coming and he can't stop it let me give
[1:02:30] you an example in Exodus 3 and verse
[1:02:34] four and when the Lord saw that and that
[1:02:37] he had turned aside to see
[1:02:41] God God called unto him out of the midst
[1:02:44] of the Bush and said Moses
[1:02:47] Moses and he said here am
[1:02:51] I and he said draw not nigh hither and
[1:02:56] put off thy shoes from off of thy feet
[1:02:59] for the place whereupon thou standest is
[1:03:02] Holy
[1:03:04] Ground moreover he said I am the god of
[1:03:09] the thy father and the god of Abraham
[1:03:12] and the god of Isaac and the god of
[1:03:15] Jacob and Moses hid his face for he was
[1:03:18] afraid to look upon God and the Lord
[1:03:21] said I have surely seen the Affliction
[1:03:24] of my people which are in Egypt and have
[1:03:27] heard their Cry by reason of their
[1:03:29] Taskmaster for I know their sorrows
[1:03:32] notice these words I am come
[1:03:36] down to deliver them out of the hand of
[1:03:39] the Egyptians and to bring them out of
[1:03:41] the out of that land unto a good land
[1:03:43] and a large unto a land of flowing with
[1:03:46] milk and honey unto a place of the
[1:03:48] Canaanites and the he titites and the
[1:03:49] amorites and the pites and the hites and
[1:03:52] the jebusites
[1:03:55] now won you just understand he's on the
[1:03:57] backs side of a desert on a on a
[1:03:59] mountain
[1:04:00] region and God is having a conference
[1:04:03] with his
[1:04:04] prophet and he's telling him you're
[1:04:07] going to be a oneman Invasion into
[1:04:11] Egypt and more than just a onean
[1:04:13] Invasion I'm going to go with
[1:04:20] you Hallelujah get that you're not going
[1:04:23] by yourself
[1:04:26] I'm going with
[1:04:29] you it's a great big difference when
[1:04:32] God's with you in the
[1:04:33] car with you in your house he's with you
[1:04:37] on your
[1:04:40] job now I want you to understand the
[1:04:42] whole world didn't understand this this
[1:04:44] happened on the back side of a
[1:04:46] desert but if we could tell Egypt in
[1:04:49] that day they were still building armies
[1:04:51] they were still building uh pyramids
[1:04:54] they were still at work they were still
[1:04:56] having their schools going on and and
[1:04:59] and they were still Gathering their
[1:05:02] taxes and Gathering all their money they
[1:05:04] were still beating the the Israel the
[1:05:06] Jewish slaves they were still going all
[1:05:09] that but listen God had made a
[1:05:11] pronouncement on the backside of this
[1:05:14] mountain Egypt is coming to its last
[1:05:18] [Applause]
[1:05:21] day it's coming to its last days
[1:05:25] I've had
[1:05:28] enough I've had enough I've seen the
[1:05:31] cries I've seen the cries I'm going to
[1:05:33] come and and take my word that I have
[1:05:36] promised and I'm going to fulfill it
[1:05:38] that's right now I want you to
[1:05:40] understand in this 24hour period cycle
[1:05:45] God was now
[1:05:48] starting a
[1:05:53] cycle that every devil in in
[1:05:56] Egypt couldn't
[1:06:02] stop now it's easy for us to amen that
[1:06:05] this
[1:06:06] morning cuz we know what
[1:06:09] happened a one man
[1:06:12] Invasion and God walked into the
[1:06:16] greatest army the greatest civilization
[1:06:18] there
[1:06:20] was and took
[1:06:22] over and took the greatest army that
[1:06:25] there was and crushed them and drowned
[1:06:30] them in the same
[1:06:32] water that he delivered the Jewish
[1:06:37] Nation Iran ought to read the
[1:06:40] book those Nations surrounding Israel
[1:06:43] needs to read the book if God is on your
[1:06:48] side if God is on your
[1:06:52] side if God is on your side
[1:06:56] there's not an army big
[1:07:00] enough Hallelujah there's not an army
[1:07:04] big enough to take back what God gave to
[1:07:08] [Applause]
[1:07:21] you are you kind of getting my
[1:07:24] thoughts now
[1:07:28] now
[1:07:29] America is also in the same
[1:07:34] thoughts America's going on America's in
[1:07:36] the
[1:07:38] industrialization we've come from
[1:07:40] agriculture then
[1:07:42] industrialization then we see we see the
[1:07:45] Great Depression we have
[1:07:48] wars phenomenal Wars difficult
[1:07:54] Wars and incredible loss of
[1:07:57] life so that we can remain a free
[1:08:01] Nation but God's going to send a
[1:08:05] messenger to this
[1:08:08] generation is not going to be hooked to
[1:08:12] any
[1:08:13] denomination so he not going to be some
[1:08:16] man-made deal it's going to be a godm
[1:08:19] made
[1:08:20] deal now we're going
[1:08:24] on brother random don't understand his
[1:08:26] ministry maybe this is the first time
[1:08:28] that you've heard these things but don't
[1:08:30] let it choke you brother brandham goes
[1:08:34] to pray about some things and and he's
[1:08:36] in a
[1:08:38] cave and there was a man stepped into
[1:08:40] the cave he would be a a darker
[1:08:43] complected Angel of the Lord about six
[1:08:46] foot tall dark complected he would be a
[1:08:49] man that would have dark shoulder length
[1:08:52] hair and he would begin to speak to him
[1:08:55] that that I'm sent from the presence of
[1:08:57] the Lord fear
[1:08:58] not and then he begins to tell him of
[1:09:01] his Commission on the earth that how he
[1:09:03] would go around the world and and he
[1:09:05] would he would preach around the world
[1:09:07] and and how that God would be with him
[1:09:10] and the angel would be with him brother
[1:09:12] Brandon would give him his
[1:09:14] excuses and I'm not an eloquent speaker
[1:09:17] I I can't do this I'm you know he's a
[1:09:19] Kentucky guy he's a he's a HomeTown in

[1:09:40] be with you give you sign in your hand
[1:09:42] and then it it would
[1:09:45] evolve can I just kind of say this after
[1:09:48] I've said this about Egypt America
[1:09:51] didn't know what was getting ready to
[1:09:52] happen to heren
[1:09:56] the church world didn't know what was
[1:09:59] getting ready to happen to
[1:10:01] her war was about to break out in the
[1:10:06] spiritual
[1:10:08] World they had just saw ausa Street and
[1:10:11] they had just saw that movement of God
[1:10:14] pouring out his gifts now at the same
[1:10:18] time that brother brandom comes on the
[1:10:19] scene there's going to become other
[1:10:21] powerful men on the scene Oral Roberts
[1:10:24] will be birthed under his ministry Billy
[1:10:27] Graham will come on the scene 1946 Billy
[1:10:31] Graham's largest meeting Los Angeles
[1:10:34] will come on the scene and if you go
[1:10:36] back and listen as I've listened to
[1:10:38] Billy Graham's initial sermons let me
[1:10:41] talk to you just a moment they wouldn't
[1:10:44] allow those kind of sermons to be
[1:10:47] preached the pastor of America would not
[1:10:52] allow be allowed to preach moral code
[1:10:57] that Billy Graham
[1:11:00] [Music]
[1:11:02] preached but it's still
[1:11:05] right can we say it's still right he
[1:11:09] preached he preached against
[1:11:14] divorce he he preached against he he
[1:11:17] preached against
[1:11:20] homosexuality listen he did let me just
[1:11:23] lay it out to you he preached the moral
[1:11:25] fiber of the
[1:11:27] scriptures and he preached that you must
[1:11:30] be born
[1:11:31] again and he preached against this this
[1:11:35] this age of becoming that you're all
[1:11:38] gods you just do anything that you want
[1:11:41] to do he would say there's only one
[1:11:46] God why are you saying that brother Ron
[1:11:48] people can stand up in this generation
[1:11:51] and just talk just a simple level of
[1:11:54] more morality and there comes a back
[1:11:57] flood against
[1:12:01] them there comes a back flood against it
[1:12:04] it shows how dark that this age
[1:12:07] [Applause]
[1:12:09] is can you imagine brother brandham
[1:12:12] standing on a world stage and preaching
[1:12:15] Jezebel
[1:12:18] religion hybrid
[1:12:21] religion indictment
[1:12:26] are you with me and knoweth it
[1:12:30] not these powerful grit sermons that's
[1:12:35] calling a bride out of
[1:12:38] denominations come out of her my people
[1:12:40] and be not a partaker of her plagues
[1:12:43] this voice was more than the voice of a
[1:12:49] man listen he wasn't God but he
[1:12:52] represented
[1:12:54] God amen are you with me and he stood
[1:12:57] there as a voice in this generation to
[1:13:01] call you out because you are so
[1:13:10] important let me just stop here for a
[1:13:14] moment brother metas would you please
[1:13:17] stand have him to stand please
[1:13:21] stand yes brother meadas would it be his
[1:13:25] his cousin Freeman met us
[1:13:32] Freeman all right thank you you can be
[1:13:34] seated brother Matos Freeman
[1:13:37] Matos was a part of the Full Gospel
[1:13:42] businessman as a matter of fact he was
[1:13:44] more powerful probably than most of this
[1:13:47] audience
[1:13:48] knows but he was a man that was
[1:13:51] responsible to get brother brandham here
[1:13:54] in 19
[1:13:56] 58 and he was personal
[1:14:01] friends help me I've just lost his
[1:14:05] name
[1:14:07] um no I'm looking for I'm looking for
[1:14:11] the name in in C in
[1:14:15] Arizona Carl Williams Carl Williams
[1:14:19] father and Carl Williams was a part of
[1:14:21] the Full Gospel businessman and what
[1:14:23] they set up was chapters to where that
[1:14:25] brother brandham wasn't welcome to go to
[1:14:27] the denominational churches so they
[1:14:29] brought it out to where that brother
[1:14:32] brandham would be accepted
[1:14:35] speaker to where that he would have a
[1:14:37] platform to where he could speak in
[1:14:40] those times AA Allen or Roberts even
[1:14:42] Billy Graham spoke in those circles some
[1:14:45] of the greatest speakers spoke in that
[1:14:47] Circle but the main one was for brother
[1:14:49] brandham to speak in those circles he'd
[1:14:51] be the main speaker because of the
[1:14:53] healing campaigns and so so Carl
[1:14:56] Williams was friends with Freeman M
[1:14:58] Meadows and so and so anyway he was
[1:15:02] responsible to get brother brandham here
[1:15:06] sometimes we forget the roots of why we
[1:15:08] are where we are I got a reason to do
[1:15:11] this now I want you to think of how well
[1:15:14] we're represented here brother brandham
[1:15:17] spoke the 1958 meetings to start with
[1:15:21] the week before he spoke one mile from
[1:15:24] here
[1:15:25] at the Pentecostal
[1:15:28] Church they turned him
[1:15:32] down because he wore a wrist
[1:15:38] watch and they called him worly because
[1:15:42] he wore a wristatch I'm not throwing a
[1:15:46] rock but somebody's going to be
[1:15:52] responsible when brother brandham tells
[1:15:55] the story of Three
[1:15:56] Squirrels and there's no squirrels to be
[1:15:59] had he's hunting in a place called
[1:16:01] Sportsman holler and brother br's a
[1:16:04] nervous person and he said there's just
[1:16:06] no squirrels here and God asked him
[1:16:08] where are you hunting at he said
[1:16:09] Sportsman
[1:16:10] holler what do you want three
[1:16:15] squirrels and now it's going to go to a
[1:16:18] higher level of speaking into
[1:16:23] existence where would you you want them
[1:16:25] at and he begins to explain where he
[1:16:28] would want them at and he would they
[1:16:30] would
[1:16:31] appear and he would shoot him and then
[1:16:35] there he would realize Visions don't
[1:16:37] bleed that's
[1:16:41] right brother Homer Frasier is the one
[1:16:44] that founded this church along with
[1:16:46] other great
[1:16:49] men
[1:16:51] yeah I need to drink that coke
[1:16:56] and
[1:16:58] so it'll be okay it'll be
[1:17:05] okay I'm fighting a real devil this
[1:17:07] ain't
[1:17:09] Hollywood and so he's with Charlie
[1:17:13] Cox now I think this is pretty
[1:17:15] interesting brother Ron you'll think
[1:17:17] this is
[1:17:22] interesting your grandfather
[1:17:27] introduced brother brandham to brother
[1:17:32] Frasier ain't that
[1:17:34] right now I think I've got this right
[1:17:38] I've heard this story from
[1:17:42] him he wore two pair of bib Dober huls
[1:17:46] and that right he wore an inner layer
[1:17:48] and an outer
[1:17:49] layer
[1:17:51] and and so he chewed tobacco we're not
[1:17:56] throwing no rocks at him but he he
[1:17:58] chewed tobacco and he went into the
[1:18:00] meeting and he said I want the Holy
[1:18:04] Ghost and our Prophet told him he said
[1:18:07] now if you'll take that tobacco out of
[1:18:09] the inner layer of your of your
[1:18:12] pants God will give you the Holy
[1:18:18] Ghost I find it interesting I want you
[1:18:21] to just stand now brother Chris brother
[1:18:24] Chris
[1:18:25] is it in your business office the table
[1:18:28] in your basement brother Chris has the
[1:18:32] table that was in brother Charlie
[1:18:36] Cox's that they ate those squirrels off
[1:18:41] of so if you ever have a question about
[1:18:44] those
[1:18:46] squirrels he's got the
[1:18:50] table and and I heard Charlie say it
[1:18:53] those squirrels
[1:18:55] tasted like
[1:18:58] squirrel and they ate like
[1:19:02] squirrel I'm getting rid of any
[1:19:04] questions
[1:19:07] here so God ordained for brother metas

[1:29:55] side that's their
[1:29:57] story and they feel convinced that
[1:29:59] they're
[1:30:00] right they're right they're right
[1:30:02] they're right they're right what they
[1:30:04] really need to do is go get on their
[1:30:08] knees let me tell you about a pastor a
[1:30:11] pastor is a guy that listen he'll listen
[1:30:14] to a a woman he'll listen to a man both
[1:30:17] of them got your
[1:30:19] stories there's a right side a left side
[1:30:22] and God's side amen I'm right brother
[1:30:25] Ron God's
[1:30:26] right amen and most of the time you can
[1:30:30] tell where who's right by
[1:30:33] attitude that's free that's free that's
[1:30:39] free two sides we all Rejoice with David
[1:30:43] going down and picking up five smooth
[1:30:46] Stones j s u s f AI t h not going too
[1:30:51] much further because I'll go four
[1:30:53] letters or
[1:30:57] a little boy that had killed a lion and
[1:30:59] killed a bear who refused to take Saul's
[1:31:01] armor and go because that
[1:31:05] slink God had anointed
[1:31:09] him and listen this Goliath was no
[1:31:13] bigger or no more wicked than the line
[1:31:17] or the
[1:31:18] bear Goliath was only the next victim
[1:31:24] you fought a lot of demons in your life
[1:31:27] and the one that's getting ready to
[1:31:28] fight you this week if he only knew he's
[1:31:32] only the next
[1:31:34] [Applause]
[1:31:46] victim so let's just flip the story here
[1:31:49] let's go to the other side Goliath would
[1:31:51] get up in the morning he would go out
[1:31:54] and scream at the Israelites they were
[1:31:56] backslid in their condition they didn't
[1:31:58] have a man that could meet the challenge
[1:31:59] of the hour Hey listen he's protected as
[1:32:02] long as there's nobody that will
[1:32:04] come and he could scream and scream and
[1:32:07] scream and scream about the God of
[1:32:10] Israel's dead and your God's asleep he's
[1:32:12] on a vacation and he could scream I'm
[1:32:15] the Champion I'm the
[1:32:18] Champion now no doubt that he had some
[1:32:22] people that just ADM admired him oh they
[1:32:26] admired how big he was how strong he was
[1:32:30] how much muscle that he had how much
[1:32:33] that he could carry how much that his
[1:32:36] armor weighed how big his helmet
[1:32:39] was if I could only be like
[1:32:42] Goliath but Goliath was headed for his
[1:32:47] last
[1:32:52] day because his Daddy had said will you
[1:32:56] take some snacks over to the
[1:33:01] boys now goliath was not there but his
[1:33:05] last day was now tick tick tick tick
[1:33:10] tick tick tick tick tick tick tick Satan
[1:33:14] listen to that your last Day's coming
[1:33:32] Goliath got up this morning and he
[1:33:33] stretched oh he
[1:33:36] stretched I bet that big old guy could
[1:33:42] stretch and he
[1:33:47] stretched stretch touch his toes
[1:33:55] time for breakfast I believe I'll have
[1:33:57] 12
[1:33:59] eggs amen probably it was a special cook
[1:34:02] assigned to
[1:34:04] him whole loaf of
[1:34:07] bread people watched him as he
[1:34:09] ate and they didn't realize he's eating
[1:34:13] for the last
[1:34:16] time
[1:34:18] yes this is his last day and no matter
[1:34:22] how much you admire him this is his last
[1:34:25] day and if you know anything about the
[1:34:28] Scriptures it says that a living dog is
[1:34:32] is
[1:34:33] greater than a king a dead
[1:34:39] King a living
[1:34:42] dog well brother Ron I'm the least in
[1:34:44] the Kingdom you don't realize you are
[1:34:47] greater than Abraham

[1:37:04] say I'm one of
[1:37:13] them can I share with you one more story
[1:37:15] this morning before I
[1:37:18] quit there was a girl that was an orphan
[1:37:22] and she was working in on her her
[1:37:23] uncle's place he was the foreman of the
[1:37:26] ranch he had a lot of daughters but
[1:37:28] since she was orphan she had no rights
[1:37:31] to the family values or the family
[1:37:34] tradition and
[1:37:36] so she cooked she cleaned she did all
[1:37:41] the Dirty Jobs she was not looked at on
[1:37:44] the same level as everybody else has
[1:37:46] looked
[1:37:50] at and so one day the armor and
[1:37:54] son would come from
[1:37:58] Chicago now he's looking for a wife sure
[1:38:01] there's plently women in
[1:38:02] Chicago but he's looking for a wife with
[1:38:06] character hadn't been able to find it
[1:38:08] where he was at listen it's character is
[1:38:11] not bought it's not sold it's not
[1:38:14] developed it's
[1:38:16] real and he was looking for a real queen
[1:38:19] for his
[1:38:21] home and so the armor and Company son
[1:38:24] has made his his pilgrimage to the to
[1:38:27] this
[1:38:28] Ranch and so they have a dance for him
[1:38:31] all the daughters of the of the and the
[1:38:34] ladies of the Society of that
[1:38:36] neighborhood they was all dressed up
[1:38:39] they was all ready to go they was all
[1:38:41] happy that he's there one of them may be
[1:38:45] the next the wife of this this
[1:38:48] incredible rich
[1:38:50] boy they put on the dog
[1:38:56] but when he looked around he saw just
[1:38:57] what he saw in
[1:39:00] Chicago so he took a breath of fresh air
[1:39:03] and he walked out to the
[1:39:05] Corral and as he's standing there there
[1:39:07] was a
[1:39:09] girl that so happened to be the orphan
[1:39:12] child came out and dumped the
[1:39:17] dishwater and he began to talk to
[1:39:21] her listen to her story
[1:39:24] she was in bare
[1:39:28] feet you've heard this story hundreds of
[1:39:32] times and he talked to her he told her
[1:39:35] his his intentions he told her what he
[1:39:38] was there looking for she knew those
[1:39:40] things but now he's telling
[1:39:43] her now it's not about 50 other girls
[1:39:47] it's about
[1:39:51] her this sermon is about you
[1:39:56] amen can I say it it's about you so go
[1:40:00] ahead and take it
[1:40:06] personal was brother brandom the first
[1:40:08] to tell the story no no no no Dwight
[1:40:11] Moody told the story but when brother
[1:40:14] Brandon picked it up he realized that he
[1:40:16] was getting the bride for Jesus Christ
[1:40:18] in the last day and so he told it
[1:40:20] personal to where you would catch it
[1:40:22] amen
[1:40:24] then he would preach choosing of a bride
[1:40:25] and talk about your character what God
[1:40:27] was looking for and lay it all just
[1:40:28] right and now here you are
[1:40:32] amen now you it's incredible she's
[1:40:36] standing here alone with him and he's
[1:40:39] telling her the
[1:40:41] story and now it's a story that's so
[1:40:47] believable it changes her life it's not
[1:40:51] this is not Disney World it's not not
[1:40:54] Cinderella listen it becomes so
[1:40:58] convincing until the next 24 hours she's
[1:41:01] changed it wasn't like the previous 24
[1:41:04] hours she's changed and he seals his
[1:41:09] story with a kiss on her
[1:41:17] cheek when she goes back inside he goes
[1:41:20] about his way and he makes her a promise
[1:41:24] I'll be back for
[1:41:26] you I'll be back for
[1:41:30] you now you know it's kind of like Jesus
[1:41:34] said tell this to no
[1:41:38] man I always think that's one of the
[1:41:40] most comical things he tells it don't
[1:41:42] tell this to nobody cuz he knows human
[1:41:47] nature now I'm going to catch you
[1:41:49] all I heard a secret yesterday
[1:41:59] it's burning so much in my
[1:42:03] belly I can't keep this to yourself I I
[1:42:06] got to tell you a secret don't tell us
[1:42:09] to
[1:42:11] nobody I know something that nobody else
[1:42:14] knows and your ears go
[1:42:20] boo now she goes back in and how how was
[1:42:25] how was the dinner last night how was
[1:42:26] the dance ah he's just come through he
[1:42:29] didn't pay us no attention he's gone he
[1:42:31] did
[1:42:34] me I spent some time around the Corral
[1:42:37] with him and he kissed me on the cheek
[1:42:40] he did
[1:42:51] what your silly little girl
[1:42:54] hallucinating your dreaming yeah
[1:42:59] baby she knew it was real she was there
[1:43:03] when it happened she heard it when he
[1:43:05] whispered in her ear she knew she knew
[1:43:07] she knew she knew she knew
[1:43:26] I think it's fascinating for about a
[1:43:27] year she starts working on a
[1:43:32] dress they laugh they they say
[1:43:35] everything against her and at the same
[1:43:37] time that she's working on her dress
[1:43:38] she's making their dinner and she's
[1:43:40] making their beds and she's she's doing
[1:43:42] her clothes she's doing everything and
[1:43:44] she's get she's doing all this cuz she's
[1:43:47] living in Two Worlds she's getting ready
[1:43:49] for a Rapture oh I'm sorry she's getting
[1:43:51] ready for a marriage and and yet she's
[1:43:53] doing these worldly things down there
[1:43:55] that she has to take care
[1:44:00] of and she does that for weeks and
[1:44:03] months

[2:13:27] God it's marriage is the comfort of life
[2:13:32] life is
[2:13:33] tough especially when you're walking
[2:13:36] alone but when both of you are have
[2:13:40] Jesus Christ as the middle of your
[2:13:42] marriage it can be a place to where it's
[2:13:45] a sanctuary from this
[2:13:47] world marriage is a clasping of hands
[2:13:51] it's a blending of Hearts it's the union
[2:13:54] of two lives becoming one your marriage
[2:13:57] must not stand by the authority of a
[2:14:00] state nor by the Seal of your wedding
[2:14:03] certificate but rather it must stand in
[2:14:05] your strength of your love and must
[2:14:08] stand in your
[2:14:09] devotion and to one another in good and
[2:14:12] in bad
[2:14:14] times finally it must stand because of
[2:14:16] God's participation in your
[2:14:20] marriage marriage can be the greatest
[2:14:22] relationship that you will ever
[2:14:24] experience however it marriage to reach
[2:14:27] his full potential potential you must
[2:14:30] allow God to be play its primary role in
[2:14:33] your
[2:14:33] relationship he knows your thoughts he
[2:14:36] knows your needs he understands your
[2:14:40] hearts and yet Your Love even for one
[2:14:42] another in fact it is what God
[2:14:45] created marriage took place in the
[2:14:48] Garden of
[2:14:49] Eden and what a canopy
[2:14:51] of the first marriage ceremony that it
[2:14:54] was Jesus attended also a feast if you
[2:14:59] remember they ran out of
[2:15:02] wine it was a good place for a first
[2:15:04] miracle at a
[2:15:06] marriage today could be a miracle for
[2:15:10] you
[2:15:11] guys you
[2:15:13] remember they ran out of wine and they
[2:15:15] went to the right one Jesus were out of
[2:15:19] wine he said Gather barrels and fill
[2:15:22] them with
[2:15:25] water there's no way that man could do
[2:15:28] this but he went
[2:15:30] in where the barrels
[2:15:32] were and when he finished
[2:15:35] today he took
[2:15:37] water and made it the best wine
[2:15:43] ever even to which that the guest at the
[2:15:46] wedding said you saved the best wine for
[2:15:50] the for the
[2:15:52] last I think today is even a better part
[2:15:56] of your marriage that Jesus entered into
[2:15:59] your home in a more Supernatural way
[2:16:02] than ever
[2:16:04] before I think as I stand here and fill
[2:16:07] the spirit of the Lord moving through my
[2:16:09] body I know that he is sanctioning this
[2:16:12] event in an incredible
[2:16:14] way today as we say these vows
[2:16:19] again I want you to mean them from your
[2:16:21] heart like never
[2:16:23] before your children that your marriage
[2:16:26] has produced will see even a greater
