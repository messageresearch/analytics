Why don't you just talk to the Lord right there? Won't you just have a conversation with Elohim this morning? Just thank him for being the God of all your days. Go ahead and talk to him right now. Maybe you just want to spend a moment in prayer thanking him for this moment that you can thank him, that you can praise him. Don't be ashamed of who's beside you. Don't be ashamed of your past. Don't be ashamed of what's going to be in your future. I know this that Jesus [music] does Jesus does make a way for you. Jesus does love you and Jesus will heal you. He is that kind of a God. Go ahead and talk to the master [music] just now. Father, we love you. Father, we praise you, Lord Jesus, for the morning that we've been given today to be able to call upon the God of I, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob to realize that you're more than enough, Lord Jesus, this morning to reach down to our needs, oh God. We pray that this morning in this service that your presence would be felt and known, oh God, to every wavered son and daughter of God. We pray, Father, that you would be God to them today. Lord, in this service, we are expecting the supernatural. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; We pray that healing would take place. You would go by the broken hearts this morning. You would go by the tendered eyes this morning. And you would minister to them in a supernatural way. Every mother that is dealing with a little [singing] bitty baby [music] today that may not be able to receive certain things from the presence of God. Maybe not be able to hear every word that is spoken. But I pray that you do something special for them today. May they feel the presence of El Shadi and may they draw upon the breasted one. As brother Ron will begin to minister the word of life today, we pray that the Holy Ghost would use the man of God to speak to our lives, to our situations. OH GOD, WE LOOK TO YOU TODAY. WE LOOK AWAY to you not of a Jesus of 2,000 years ago, but we look away to this Jesus today, the same yesterday, today, and forever. So, Father, we'll give you praise and we'll love on you this morning in the name of Jesus Christ. [music] Amen. Let the church resound with praises unto the most high God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Blessed be the name of the most high God. Do you love on the Lord Jesus this morning? Do you love him? &gt;&gt; Do you love him? &gt;&gt; Then let heaven and earth hear you say, "I love you, Lord Jesus. I love you, Lord Jesus. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. Amen. Amen. We're going to get ready to go to the prayer requests [music] this morning. We got many needs amongst us as a local body, but our God knows every one [music] of them. And I'm so thankful to know that he's a healer this morning. So we take these needs not before not before an empty vessel, but we take them before the most powerful people that have the ability to go out and speak worlds into [music] existence. It isn't just for something in the past, but I believe that right here in this place that [music] the Holy Spirit can get a hold of you brothers and you sisters and you can start changing the very [music] very molecular status of people's life and cancer cells can turn into good cells. I believe you have that ability. When you pray, you're not talking to a weak God. You're talking to Almighty God. We want to bring our pastor, Brother Ron, before the Lord today and ask that God would minister to him. Sister Wanda needs a touch from the Lord. Brother Jeff Breeden, all of these these individuals, [music] these are saints of God &gt;&gt; that need a touch from the master. Sister Terresa Delaney fighting cancer. [music] We pray that our Lord Jesus Christ would go by their way and just touch them. I believe he's more than able. For Sister Judy Hensley, needing needing to be remembered in [music] prayer. Sister June Shifflet needs a touch from the Lord. We were able to go by there yesterday evening before service and just spend some time in prayer with [music] her. We pray that God would minister to her. Our song leader, Brother Matthew, is at UVA today trying [music] to get some help and find some some avenues to to get uh find what the matter is in his back. Needs a real touch [music] from the Lord. the saints there in Jamaica that have been wiped out by this past hurricane. We just pray that [music] the Lord Jesus would go by their way. Amen. I believe he's a shelter [music] in a time of storm. Don't you? Amen. We're going to invite Brother Randall this morning if he could come and pray over these [music] prayer requests. How many has a need this morning? You realize what you [music] just did? You broke the atmosphere. Brother Brandon would say it one time. He said, he [music] said, 'You seen that sister? He said, just raise that hand like that. He said, 'The reason why she did that? He said, the pillar fire was going over right there. You're not raising your hand to a man. You're raising your hand to Elohim that is in [music] this room that can meet these needs. Let's talk to the father today as brother Randall prays. Bow our heads this morning. Lord, you've heard the requests have been brought forth across this [music] pulpit, Lord. Lord, there are strong requests. Lord, asking for you to touch these saints, Lord, they're dealing with cancer. Lord, I just pray you'll reach down and touch each and every one of them, Lord. Lord, rejuvenate [music] themselves, Lord. Give them the energies they need to come back into their bodies, Lord. Lord, we know you can touch them, Lord. I've seen it in the past, Lord. Let this be another testimony [music] of your power, Lord. Lord, with all the requests from overseas in Jamaica with the bride that's been destroyed by this hurricane, [music] Lord. Lord, the lives you protected, Lord, these buildings can be rebuilt. Lord, I just pray you minister to each and every one of them today, Lord. Lord, remind them that you're there with them, Lord God. You didn't turn their back on them, Lord. This is just another thing of the devil, Lord, to try to destroy the work that [music] you've got going in this world, Lord. I pray you just reach down and be with each and every one of them today. Lord, with the other requests that came in this morning, Lord, Lord, for the unspoken requests in the bride today, I just pray you will speak [music] to every one of us this morning, Lord. Be with the ministry this morning, Lord, as it brings forth the word, Lord. I pray you'll give him strength as he preaches, Lord. [music] He pours out his heart to the bride, Lord. Using the gift you give him, Lord. I just pray you be with him, Lord. Give him [music] the strength and the energies to to speak out what you've put on his heart this morning, Lord. and we just give you the praise and the glory and we just ask you to be with us in the rest of the service today in Jesus name.

We're fighters. &gt;&gt; And if you're not a fighter, &gt;&gt; you're not going to make it. &gt;&gt; You've got to overcome this leodysian age. You just can't float by and float here and float there and go there like a like a a piece of wood on the river. You have got to fight. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; God just didn't leave you here to fight on your own. &gt;&gt; He gave you the best weapons that he could give you. &gt;&gt; And that's the word of the Lord. 2 Corinthians chapter 10 and verse three. For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh. For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of the strongholds, casting down imaginations and every high thing, and exalted itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ. &gt;&gt; Psalms chapter 46 and verse one. &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; the God of our refuge and the strength, a very present help in the time of trouble. Therefore will not we fear, though war, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea, though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. There is a river and the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God. the holy place of the tabernacles of the most high. God is in the midst of her and she shall not be moved. God will shall help her and that right early. The heathen raged and the kings were moved. He uttered his voice and the earth melted. The Lord of hosts is with us. The God of Jacob is our refuge. Come behold the works of our Lord and what desolation he hath made in the earth. He maketh wars to cease unto the ends of the earth. He breakth the bow and cutth the spear into sunder. He burneth the chariot in the fire. Be still and know that I am God. And I will be exalted among the heathen. I will be exalted in the earth. The Lord of hosts is with us. The God of Jacob is our refuge. &gt;&gt; You may be seated this evening. God bless you. May the Lord bless the reading of his word. Psalms Proverbs chapter 18 and verse 10. The Lord the name of the Lord is a strong tower. &gt;&gt; The name of the Lord is a strong tower &gt;&gt; and the righteous run into it and it is saved. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "You've got," Brother Random says, he said, "you've got to go do it. You've got to fight for every inch of ground that you have." &gt;&gt; Every man in here that's born again of the spirit of God knows that you have had to fight for every inch of ground, tow the mark with Satan. Isn't that right, friends? This is not a picnic. This is a battleground. And he says, "We never come here to eat cookies and and so forth. We're in a battle." &gt;&gt; Hate to wake you up, &gt;&gt; but we're in a battle. Yes. &gt;&gt; Could you imagine the United States Army training a man to sit around and eat cookies and so forth while he gives him a uniform and his gun and trains him to get out there with fight and to and defend the nation? That's what we've got to do. We've got to defend our God-given rights. &gt;&gt; He said what God said, it's ours. Let's stand right toe-to-toe with Satan and ashamed. He says, "It puts me in the mind of something that like ourselves." Then then I said to the people, I'm getting to a spot. I need to have more faith. That's what what's what that's what I'm home for now is to get a new burst of faith. So go on. He said, "Look like when you pray the people you apologize, Mr. Devil, would you please move over and and let me nothing? &gt;&gt; He said fight has faith has muscles &gt;&gt; and hair on its chest &gt;&gt; and when it speaks EVERYTHING ELSE SHUTS UP. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Don't go in and tell Mr. Devil you move out. HE SAID GET OUT OF HERE. I'M A SON OF GOD. Commissioned of God. Leave them alone. &gt;&gt; That moves. He said, "YOU HAVE NO APOLOGIES TO THE DEVIL." &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; As bad as the devil's treated some of you, you don't have to apologize to him. &gt;&gt; Listen, this is no political correctness when we're fighting the devil. &gt;&gt; You have no apology to the devil. nothing to DO WITH HIM. NOT ASHAMED OF THE WORD OF GOD. NOT ASHAMED TO YOUR COMMISSION. NOT ASHAMED TO TO OF WHO YOU ARE. &gt;&gt; The only shame THAT I AM IS I'M a Brandham. &gt;&gt; I'm ashamed. &gt;&gt; I'm a Spencer. &gt;&gt; But I got a higher calling. &gt;&gt; That's my earthly birth. I'm ashamed of my failures. I believe we could all say that. &gt;&gt; AMEN. BUT AS HIS SERVANT, I'M NOT ASHAMED. I'm not ashamed of his word. Whether it's whether it's denomination, kings, potentates, whatever it might be, just ready TO GIVE AN ANSWER. GOD CALLS for it. &gt;&gt; Hebrews chapter 13 and verse 8. It's our theme. It is Jesus Christ, the name above all names. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ, the same yesterday &gt;&gt; and today. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND FOREVER. &gt;&gt; Matthew chapter 16 and verse 18. AND I SAY ALSO UNTO THEE THAT THOU art Peter, and upon this rock, the revelation of who he is, I will build my church, and the gates of hell, which is the strongest part, &gt;&gt; shall not prevail against it, &gt;&gt; and I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom. I like that. the kingdom of heaven. AND WHATSOEVER THOU SHALT BIND on earth shall be bound in heaven. And whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. &gt;&gt; So I believe we can sit here and look across this audience and say we're part of the most powerful people on the earth. We just drove through Geneva, Switzerland, and we took pictures of the the building to where that they all all the leaders of the world come together and every flag from all over the earth is is there and all down through what a beautiful place it is. But it's a it's a place where nations gather in this very very neutral place to have a conference. conferences to try to settle different things and differences out the earth. They gather THE MOST POWERFUL PEOPLE THAT there are. &gt;&gt; But I BELIEVE THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST THAT HAS BEEN WRAPPED around this message &gt;&gt; ARE THE MOST POWERFUL PEOPLE ON THE EARTH. &gt;&gt; Who has more power in heaven, a son and a daughter OF GOD OR AN ANGEL? LISTEN, never forget who you are. &gt;&gt; Did that extra hour of sleep &gt;&gt; cause you guys to be dead? &gt;&gt; Turn to your neighbor. Say, "Wake up. Listen, I don't want to waste an hour here. &gt;&gt; I'm not here to waste your hour. &gt;&gt; If we're going to waste an hour, we'll go eat cookies somewhere another. &gt;&gt; I'm here to This is the most important thing we're going to do all week. &gt;&gt; Going to Walmart is the mo not the most important thing. [applause] &gt;&gt; That's right. Your job is not the most important thing. &gt;&gt; Heavens and earth &gt;&gt; will pass away. &gt;&gt; And the earth that we are on right now, &gt;&gt; this beautiful place that we are in right now won't be long will be ashes. &gt;&gt; It won't be long. It'll be ashes. Brother Andrew, I hope I don't steal your thunder, but this morning he just told a story about Poland and going through Oawitch and going through those horrific places. There's people that don't even believe that that that even happened that that that those concentration camps and millions and millions of Jews were killed in those concentration camps. I can't imagine that people have come to the place to where well that didn't happen. &gt;&gt; Well, let me just say the reason that they they don't want to believe that is because it's going to happen again. &gt;&gt; I don't want to be here for it. &gt;&gt; It's called the tribulation period. So why I am preaching with the force that I'm preaching with is to keep you from going there. [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might. PUT ON THE WHOLE ARMOR THAT YOU MAY BE ABLE to stand AGAINST THE WS OF the devil. For we WRESTLE NOT AGAINST FLESH and blood, BUT AGAINST PRINCIPALITIES, AND AGAINST THE powers of the rulers of the darkness of this world, and against spiritual wickedness IN HIGH PLACES. WHEREFORE TAKE unto you the whole armor of God, that you may able to stand withstand in the evil day, and having done all to stand. Stand therefore, having your loins gird about with truth, having on the breastplate of righteousness, HAVING YOUR FEET SHOT WITH THE PREPARATION OF THE GOSPEL OF PEACE, AND ABOVE ALL TAKEN THE SHIELD OF FAITH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHEREWITH YOU SHALL BE ABLE TO QUENCH ALL THE FIERY DARTS OF THE WICKED. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND TAKE THE HELMET OF SALVATION AND THE SWORD OF THE SPIRIT WHICH IS THE WORD OF GOD. NOW THIS IS THE MOST POWERFUL PRAYING ALWAYS &gt;&gt; WITH ALL PRAYER AND SUPPLICATION IN THE SPIRIT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Hebrews 4 and verse 12. For the word of God is quick AND POWERFUL AND SHARPER THAN ANY TWO-EDGED SWORD, piercing even the dividing the asunderer of the soul and the spirit and the joints and the moral and the discerner of the thoughts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the intents of the heart. SO THE WORD OF GOD KEEPS US CLEAN. &gt;&gt; I WANT A GOSPEL THAT WON'T JUST MAMBY PAMBY me around. &gt;&gt; I WANT A GOSPEL THAT'LL KEEP ME CLEAN, &gt;&gt; KEEP US PURE. [applause] &gt;&gt; Luke 10 AND VERSE 19. BEHOLD, I GIVE UNTO YOU POWER TO TREAD UPON SERPENTS. I GIVE YOU POWER TO TREAD UPON serpents and scorpions AND OVER THE POWER OF THE ENEMY. &gt;&gt; NOT PLAY WITH THEM. TREAD ON THEM. &gt;&gt; Stomp on them. &gt;&gt; KEEP SATAN UNDER YOUR FEET. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; It's here. I done put it down twice. It's good for us. Mark chapter 16. AND THESE SIGNS SHALL FOLLOW THEM THAT BELIEVE. In my name, &gt;&gt; shall they cast out devils. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In my name. Oh, Brother Ron, but I'm having such A HARD TIME. CAST HIM OUT. &gt;&gt; STOP AND CAST HIM OUT. I'M NOT PUTTING UP WITH YOU TODAY. &gt;&gt; TAKE THE WORD OF GOD. TAKE IT ACROSS YOUR SUPERNATURAL LIPS AND SPEAK to the devil. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, THAT'S KIND OF TALKING TO YOURSELF. LET ME JUST SAY THE MOST POWERFUL THING THAT YOU DO EVERY DAY IS PRAY. &gt;&gt; We have the authority to to create an atmosphere in our home. RIGHT. &gt;&gt; OUR HOME SHOULD NOT BE A PLACE WHERE WE FIGHT AND FUSS AND FUME. &gt;&gt; It shouldn't BE STICKERS AND WALKING ON EGGSHELLS ALL THE TIME. IT SHOULD BE A PLACE OF LOVE. IT SHOULD BE A PLACE OF POWER. IT SHOULD BE A SANCTUARY. COME ON, HELP ME PREACH TODAY. [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; YOU MAY NEED TO FALL IN LOVE AGAIN. LET ME JUST SAY START TODAY. &gt;&gt; Psalms chapter 27 and verse one. Very familiar. The Lord is my light and my salvation. Who shall I fear? &gt;&gt; That last words is real powerful. The scripture mentions fear 600 times. So, Satan operates with fear. &gt;&gt; The Lord is my light and my salvation. Whom whom &gt;&gt; whom &gt;&gt; come on &gt;&gt; shall I fear? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I'll give you an example. Doctors when they begin to give you difficult news, I find it is amazing that people will come to a spot and cancer is mentioned. A lot of times it's just part of a sentence. Really don't have cancer, but there's it's a it's leading up to it and we're going to try to stop it. And people become so consumed &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; with the fear of cancer. &gt;&gt; LET ME JUST SAY THIS TO YOU. CANCER IS NOT GREATER THAN GOD. &gt;&gt; Cancer is not greater than God. &gt;&gt; I DON'T WAKE UP EVERY MORNING AND TAKE MY CHEMO and fear THE CANCER THAT I FIGHT FOR these almost six years now. I DON'T FEAR IT. ARE YOU WITH ME? IF YOU FEAR IT &gt;&gt; AND YOU DREAD IT, IT'LL WHIP YOU. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; IT'LL WHIP YOU. &gt;&gt; IT'S A DEMON THAT LIVES OFF OF YOUR GOOD LIFE. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Are you WITH ME NOW? YOU DON'T HAVE TO FEAR THESE THINGS. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, WE'RE CHILDREN OF GOD. [screaming] &gt;&gt; SOMEBODY OUGHT TO HELP ME PREACH right here. WE'RE CHILDREN OF GOD. WE DON'T HAVE TO FEAR THE DEVIL. [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; The Lord is the strength of my life. OF WHOM SHALL I BE AFRAID? &gt;&gt; When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes came upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell. Though a host should ENCAMP AGAINST ME, MY heart shall not fail. Though war should rise against me, IN THIS WILL I BE CONFIDENT. &gt;&gt; GOD'S NOT TALKING ABOUT A picnic in any of these scriptures. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I'll be laying ON A HAMMOCK. NO, HE'S NOT TALK ABOUT HAMMOCK LAYING. &gt;&gt; I'm going to be LAYING UNDER THE SUNSHINE and the breeze is GOING TO BE BLOWING. NO, [screaming] YOU'RE AT WAR. [cheering] That's right, &gt;&gt; BOY. BROTHER RON, BACK IN THE GOOD OLD DAYS, YOU KNOW, WE USED TO HAVE A LIFE OF A PARTY. LET ME JUST SAY IT. &gt;&gt; LET'S CUT IT UP ONE FUR OF THOSE WERE NOT YOUR GOOD OLD DAYS. &gt;&gt; You were on YOUR WAY TO HELL. [cheering] &gt;&gt; THOSE WERE NOT YOUR TRUE FRIENDS. &gt;&gt; I MISS IT. SO BAD. IT'S BECAUSE YOUR HEART IS IN the wrong place. &gt;&gt; I'm not feeding MY MIND ON THE GOOD OLD DAYS. &gt;&gt; Drinking was destroying your liver. &gt;&gt; Drugs was destroying your pancreas and your brain cells. DON'T TELL ME THE DEVIL IS A HARD SLAVE MASTER. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. I find it amazing that we did all of that in our life. We spent all of that money on that nonsense &gt;&gt; and then when we come to church [applause] &gt;&gt; we fought in the world. We did all kind of nonsense in the world and then we become mice. &gt;&gt; WE BECOME A MOUSE. I'LL SAY IT. A MOUSE SITTING IN A IN A CHAIR. He didn't even SHAKE MY HEAD. GET OVER IT. [screaming] &gt;&gt; I GOT MY FEELINGS HURT. COME ON. &gt;&gt; COME ON. YOU'RE BIGGER THAN THAT. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, that's bigger than what you think it was. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's bigger than what you think it is. Cuz the devil will get in your mind. &gt;&gt; The devil will get in your mind and go, "Those people don't love you." WHEN THEY LOVE YOU MORE THAN WHAT THEM FRIENDS OUT THERE DID. [applause] These people are GOING TO SPEND ETERNITY WITH YOU. [applause] &gt;&gt; [sighs and gasps] &gt;&gt; Brother Rond, you know what that guy over there did and that guy over there did and that guy over there. Listen, if the blood of Jesus Christ is applied, &gt;&gt; it's gone. &gt;&gt; It's gone. And that part of the book is taken away. &gt;&gt; You'll enjoy next week. I'm going to speak on In spite of your flaw. Let me let me just give you a little little taste of it. &gt;&gt; I wish I had a Well, let me give you a taste. It would be a bad day if somebody said something against Brother Homer Frasier. Now, &gt;&gt; I I want y'all to know IT'D BE A BAD DAY. &gt;&gt; It'd be a BAD DAY. &gt;&gt; BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW IF YOU WOULD SAY SOMETHING ABOUT HIM, you're only kicking a dead man. &gt;&gt; And he's in heaven. &gt;&gt; And he could care less what you say. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Shannon, would you stand up a minute? Now, I want you to turn around. I want you to look at this audience. NOW, I WANT YOU TO IMAGINE here just for a minute that there's a picture frame around him. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; There's a picture frame around him. And you know what? You start picking on him and start bringing up his past and bringing up the nonsense in his life. YOU'RE KICKING A DEAD MAN. [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; You are wasting your time. [applause and cheering] You're going to like it. &gt;&gt; But I knew you needed this today. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Where'd you get that, brother? When I was preaching the memorial for brother brother Bisll, I got that sermon. &gt;&gt; Oh, I wish he wouldn't go nowhere, but I get those sermons like that and you could like it. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Though a host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear. Though war should rise AGAINST ME, IN THIS WILL I BE CONFIDENT. WHEN I AM at war, I realize I'm a child of God. &gt;&gt; One thing that I have desired of the Lord that will I seek after, that I may dwell in the house OF THE LORD ALL THE DAYS OF MY LIFE, to behold the beauty of the Lord, AND TO INQUIRE IN HIS TEMPLE. NOTICE THESE NEXT WORDS. FOR IN THE TIME OF TROUBLE, &gt;&gt; for in the TIME OF TROUBLE, HE SHALL HIDE ME IN HIS PAVILION. IN THE SECRET OF HIS TABERNACLE SHALL HE HIDE ME, AND HE SHALL SET me upon a rock, AND NOW SHALL my head be lifted up above my enemies roundabout. Therefore will I OFFER IN HIS TABERNACLE SACRIFICES OF JOY. &gt;&gt; NOTICE THESE WORDS. I WILL SING. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; YAY. I WILL SING PRAISES UNTO [screaming] THE LORD, &gt;&gt; brother Ron. But I don't like it. SO NOISY DOG GOING TO HEAVEN. &gt;&gt; But don't go to hell either &gt;&gt; cuz there's going to be weeping and whailing and nashing OF TEETH. &gt;&gt; EVERYBODY'S GOING TO BE NAKED. &gt;&gt; You like nakedness here, you'll like nakedness in hell. But I got news for you, baby. Ain't everybody looking like they're at Hollywood? &gt;&gt; Just give them baby dolls. They're about 10, 20 years. They don't look like that either. Naked in hell. I was preaching a convention and the preacher in front of me preached that sermon. naked in hell. I think everybody, including the mayor of the city, wanted to get saved after he preached that. I even thought about getting saved all over again. Listen, hell ain't a place you want to go. &gt;&gt; I want to tell you, I'm doing my very best to kind of keep you out of it. [applause] God at the beginning. At the beginning, God doesn't evolve. I want you to understand God is infinite. &gt;&gt; God don't change his mind. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; God don't change his mind. &gt;&gt; Right. He is infinite. &gt;&gt; He knows all things. He never has a new thought. So God don't do like man does. Man fought with rocks, then he thought with knives, then he thought with thought made a gun, bow and arrows. And he and he and you know the one that's got the best weapon has the has the most power. &gt;&gt; So God didn't do that. Notice this quote. God at the beginning gave his children the atomic weapon. BECAUSE HE'S THE INFINITE GOD. NOW, seeing there was going to be conflict and there was going to be a battle, GOD EQUIPPED HIS CHILDREN with the right kind of ammunition right down of the right kind of attack, the right kind of everything that they had need of. That would SWEEP THEM ALL THE WAY from Eden TO THE RAPTURE. &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS IT? THE WORD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE word it'll defeat Satan anywhere, any place. &gt;&gt; ANOTHER PLACE HE SAYS ANYWHERE, ANY PLACE, under any condition. Now, why do we want to substitute anything else when we've already got the best? [snorts] Satan can't defeat the word, but he can defeat how you think about the word. &gt;&gt; He can't defeat the church. Well, he will bring you things that will try to defeat how you think about the church. &gt;&gt; Come on, buddy. Come on. &gt;&gt; Is it important to go to church? Before long, you'll start missing. &gt;&gt; Come on, buddy. &gt;&gt; And when you get start missing, you'll start getting weak. And then the devil can tell you any lie &gt;&gt; any lie &gt;&gt; that you can possibly get. Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Listen. He's the devil. HE DIDN'T START YESTERDAY. &gt;&gt; HE STARTED IN HEAVEN. HE'S STILL AT WAR RIGHT NOW. AND HE'LL STAY AT WAR. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; NOW, 1 Corinthians chapter 15 and verse 58. Therefore, my beloved brethren, be you steadfast. That's right. &gt;&gt; Unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord. &gt;&gt; For as much as you know that your labor is not in vain. &gt;&gt; Whether you're the the the first hour worker or the last hour worker. &gt;&gt; Come on, buddy. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Every person IN THIS BUILDING SHOULD STRIVE TO BE A PILLAR, &gt;&gt; a pillar in the church, &gt;&gt; A PILLAR IN THE CHURCH. BUT BEFORE YOU CAN BE A PILLAR IN THE CHURCH, BE A PILLAR IN YOUR FAMILY. &gt;&gt; UNSHAKABLE, [screaming] UNMOVABLE. Men of God who believe God and know what God has promised is not afraid. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD WILL STICK WITH his word. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; JUST AS CERTAIN AS HE IS GOD. &gt;&gt; LET ME JUST SAY THIS. YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY THAT the Calvary is coming. It's already here. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to behave. I'm trying to behave. &gt;&gt; He says, "Now watch what he did when he was on earth. He conquered and possessed every gate that the enemy had." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; THE ROYAL SEED. HE PROMISED IT BY THE WORD. HE CONQUERED IT. HE CONQUERED THE GATE OF SICKNESS. &gt;&gt; Thank God HE DID. HE CONQUERED THE GATE OF SICKNESS FOR US. THAT'S WHAT HE COME TO DO. REMEMBER SICK PEOPLE, HE CONQUERED THAT GATE. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; An amen for brother Ron. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You don't HAVE TO CONQUER IT. IT'S ALREADY CONQUERED. OTHER men had to conquer their OWN GATE, BUT YOU DON'T HAVE to conquer IT. IT'S ALREADY CONQUERED. HE CONQUERED THE GATE OF SICKNESS. &gt;&gt; And what did he do when he conquered the gate of sickness? saying that he WOULD DO WHATEVER YOU SHALL ASK ON EARTH SHALL HE AND WHATSOEVER YOU'LL BOUND ON EARTH YOU'LL HE'LL BIND IN HEAVEN and he'll give the keys of the gate HE CONQUERED THE GATE OF temptation &gt;&gt; this IS A BIGGIE BY THE WORD AND THE KEYS WAS RESIST THE ENEMY [snorts] &gt;&gt; RESIST THE ENEMY &gt;&gt; AMEN AMEN. &gt;&gt; And he WILL FLEE FROM YOU. [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Brother Andrew talked about her last night, but that little 5 foot2 blindheaded lady over there, when she WANTED TO GET A POINT ACROSS, SHE'D SAY, "I'VE HAD ENOUGH." AND SHE'D STOMP THAT RIGHT FOOT. Did it work for you? Hey, I ain't no dummy. We're not dumb people here. &gt;&gt; But David, we've learned to live here. &gt;&gt; There's a time to fight. &gt;&gt; Come on, help me preach now. Don't you want me to look like a wimp now? GET WITH ME. THERE'S A TIME TO FIGHT AND THERE'S A TIME TO LOVE. [applause] WOO. [applause] AND IT'S ALWAYS A TIME TO HUG. Tell your wife you love her right now. Brother Ron, this is a worship place. That's a good start place to start right there. That's a good place. Ain't that right, Jay? Every time I look that way, it's a grin about that about the W. He's heard about it for years and now he knows what we're talking about. &gt;&gt; You also going to know about that foot. [applause] Now, LET'S MAKE THAT SPIRITUAL. WE ARE THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; WE ARE THE QUEEN OF HEAVEN. [laughter] &gt;&gt; EVERYTHING THAT HE OWNS, BROTHER DOUG, WE OWN. &gt;&gt; EVERY POWER THAT HE HAS, WE HAVE. &gt;&gt; DON'T BE A SECURITY CAP. THIS AIN'T THE SPOT. COME ON. [screaming] &gt;&gt; STOP YOUR FOOT. &gt;&gt; Go ahead and stop it right there. &gt;&gt; He conquered death. He conquered hell. &gt;&gt; He conquered death and hell. He conquered what others couldn't conquer because they're of THE NATURAL SEED. BUT THIS IS A spiritual seed. He conquered the gate of the grave. &gt;&gt; Amen. and rose up on the third day for our justification. Now we are more than conquerors. &gt;&gt; We have a right into it as our inheritance. MORE THAN CONQUEROR. SAY IT WITH ME. &gt;&gt; More than conqueror. &gt;&gt; NOW WE'RE DEALING WITH A DEFEATED ENEMY. &gt;&gt; The enemy that you fight &gt;&gt; IS DEFEATED. &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HE'S DEFEATED. &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to behave now. We're more THAN CONQUERORS. DEALING WITH A DEFEATED ENEMY. SICKNESS IS DEFEATED. [snorts] &gt;&gt; DEATH IS DEFEATED. HELL IS DEFEATED. That's right. &gt;&gt; Everything is defeated. &gt;&gt; Watch what he brother says. Oh my wish that I WAS TWICE MY SIZE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And now maybe I feel about twice as good. WE ARE DISPUTING WITH A DEFEATED ENEMY. &gt;&gt; Let me go through the great quote book for just a little bit. I can do all things &gt;&gt; through Christ that strengthens me. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE GIVETH POWER TO THE FAINT, AND TO THEM THAT HAVE NO MIGHT, he increasth strength. &gt;&gt; OH MAN. THEREFORE, I I TAKE PLEASURE in infirmities and reproaches, IN NECESSITIES, AND PERSECUTIONS, IN DISTRESSES FOR CHRIST'S SAKE. FOR WHEN I AM WEAK, THEN I am strong. &gt;&gt; You heard it last night. When you FEEL LIKE GIVING UP, DON'T WORRY. &gt;&gt; HE'S GOT A HOLD OF YOU, &gt;&gt; brother Ron. that I've come to the END OF MY ROPE. PIE NOT HANG [screaming] ON. &gt;&gt; YOU THINK YOU'RE THE ONE HANGING ON? FORGET IT. YOU DON'T HAVE THE STRENGTH TO HANG ON. IT'S GOD [screaming] THAT'S GOT A HOLD OF YOU, NOT YOU GOT A HOLD OF GOD. IT'S GOD [screaming] THAT'S GOT A HOLD OF YOU. [applause] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I just feel like giving up. Go ahead. Oh, that's horrible, brother. That's horrible. Go ahead. &gt;&gt; IF YOU'RE A SEED OF GOD, YOU CAN'T GIVE UP. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T QUIT. YOU CAN'T RUN. &gt;&gt; IF YOU'RE A SEED OF GOD, &gt;&gt; EVERY time you quit, &gt;&gt; COME ON. SOMETHING OUTSIDE OF YOU KEEPS PUSHING YOU. &gt;&gt; I'M NOT DRIVEN BY MY ENERGY. I'M DRIVEN BY AN ARTISIAN WELL THAT'S ON THE INSIDE of me. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Greater is he that is in you. &gt;&gt; THAN HE THAT IS in the world. &gt;&gt; IT IS NOT THE SIZE OF THE DOG THAT'S IN THE FIGHT. &gt;&gt; COME ON NOW. IT IS THE SIZE OF THE FIGHT THAT'S IN THE [screaming] DOG. [applause] SAY IT WITH ME. IT IS NOT THE SIZE OF THE DOG THAT'S IN THE FIGHT. IT IS THE SIZE OF THE FIGHT THAT'S IN THE DOG. &gt;&gt; GO AHEAD AND SCREAM BOOT. [applause] For God has not given us a spirit of fear, &gt;&gt; BUT OF POWER AND OF love and of a sound mind. &gt;&gt; I will love thee, oh Lord, my strength. The Lord is my rock and my strength. He is WHOM I TRUST, MY BAKLA, the horn of my salvation and my power. You've heard it before. Listen again. Isaiah 40 and verse 29. HE GIVETH POWER TO THE FAINT. HE GIVETH POWER TO THE FAINT. AND TO THEM THAT HAVE NO MIGHT, HE INCREASTH STRENGTH. EVEN THE YOUTH SHALL FAINT AND BE WEARY, AND THE YOUNG men shall utterly fall. Notice his next words. But they that wait upon the Lord. &gt;&gt; Shall renew their strength, &gt;&gt; THEY SHALL MOUNT UP ON WINGS AS AN EAGLE. They shall run and not be weary. THEY SHALL WALK AND not faint. You ever been in a real fight? I'm not talking about a handshaking contest, but a real fight. A real fight. Let me just say, when you in a real fight, you ain't worried about rules. That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; You ain't worried about rules. &gt;&gt; You going to fight with all your might. As a matter of fact, a real fight, you don't know whether you're going to live through it or not. &gt;&gt; But if you want to go home to see your wife, you got to fight. I woke up after almost a month looking at a glass with my wife standing on the other side of the glass. I know what fight's about. If there's any preacher that knows what fight's about, I know what fight's about. Right? &gt;&gt; For somebody got to fight cancer, God give me strength. &gt;&gt; I'll fight it. &gt;&gt; But I can't do it on my own. &gt;&gt; I can't do it on my own. Sister Wanda has listened to me preach over these last five years. Now she knows the fight. She knows the fight and it's real. &gt;&gt; Sister Wanda, you raise your hand right there. She knows this baby's real. &gt;&gt; She got a dog that she loves. She's got a man sitting beside of her that she loves. She got family around her that she loves. But she's got to fight that enemy, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Cuz that enemy wants to take her life, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; BAD NEWS. HE PICKED THE WRONG ONE. [screaming] [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; I PICKED HER. BUT WHAT ABOUT YOU? &gt;&gt; YOU HEAR THESE SERMONS FOR YEARS AND ONE DAY IT COMES YOUR TURN. &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO FIGHT FOR YOUR CHILDREN. &gt;&gt; IT'S WORTH FIGHTING FOR. [screaming] &gt;&gt; You got to fight FOR YOUR MARRIAGE. IT'S WORTH FIGHTING FOR. &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO FIGHT FOR YOUR OWN SANITY. IT'S WORTH FIGHTING FOR. &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, "I'm so glad that a man can so completely serve God until the devil don't know what to do with him. I'm so glad that a man can so completely serve God until the devil don't know what to do with him. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; Is that just a quote? &gt;&gt; Are you ready to live it? &gt;&gt; I shared this with the brothers. We're at the point now where this message is truth that will take us into a rapture. I want you to understand, moms and dads, this message and these quotes has put us into a rapture condition. &gt;&gt; We can't stay here. &gt;&gt; If you look at the news, me and you can't stay here. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We can't stay here. I don't care what party you vote in on Tuesday. I don't care. They're all rotten. &gt;&gt; They're all rotten. Get it? Get it in your mind. They're all rotten. America is not the America of 120 years ago. It ain't that America no more. &gt;&gt; We're on ahead. &gt;&gt; Oh, but brother, I'm worried about my food. Don't you worry. God will be your provider. [applause] &gt;&gt; Let me just say this. You worried about who's going to put food on your table. Let me say God's going to do that. &gt;&gt; Let let me let me just share this with you. We're going to a kingdom &gt;&gt; and be real clear with you where we're not going to vote presidents. &gt;&gt; We've already got a king. &gt;&gt; Let me explain something to you about that place. There's not going to be a hospital. There's not going to be a doctor &gt;&gt; that's needed. &gt;&gt; There's not going to be a lawyer needed. &gt;&gt; That's right, Sydney Katy. You can be in heaven and not have to work. &gt;&gt; WE WON'T NEED A POLICE FORCE. &gt;&gt; THANK EVERYONE for our police force. &gt;&gt; WE'RE GOING TO BE GUARDED BY THE ANGELS OF HEAVEN. WE NOT EVEN GOING TO HAVE A TIMEX, BABY. &gt;&gt; He's been 55 minutes. And that is what I've been 55 minutes. But I'm getting ready to close. There's not going to be one of these. &gt;&gt; You don't have to worry about your dinner in heaven. God's going to provide it for you. &gt;&gt; This is what I love. There's not going to be a right in heaven. &gt;&gt; Not one. &gt;&gt; There's not going to be one sinner in heaven. &gt;&gt; There's not going to be a lie. &gt;&gt; There's not going to be a drunk. &gt;&gt; Not going to be a pervert. &gt;&gt; I'm all right. I'm all right. Don't you worry. &gt;&gt; Ain't going to be one of them there. &gt;&gt; SODOM AND GOMORRAH IS NOT GOING TO BE THERE. Thank you. [applause] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THIS WORLD'S NOT MY HOME. &gt;&gt; I'm only a temporary being here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'M FIGHTING TO GO THERE. &gt;&gt; I'M FIGHTING TO GO THERE. I have fought for my children here. I have fought for my grandchildren here. I HAVE FOUGHT FOR THIS CHURCH HERE. &gt;&gt; LET ME JUST SAY I FIGHT FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; I FIGHT ON MY KNEES FOR YOU. I CALL YOUR NAME before God. &gt;&gt; FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; I JUST DON'T PREACH FOR YOU. I FIGHT FOR YOU. I walk into a sick person's room yesterday and I said, "You're sick, aren't you?" Well, yeah. I said, "I see it." How you know? I said, "I see it on you. You're sick." And I come to pray for you. When I preach, I can tell if the sheep are in a battle and there's sickness on them. &gt;&gt; They got weak. They ain't eating right. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Sometimes sheep get sores on them. &gt;&gt; And sheep like to fit sheep and they'll start licking that sore place and then they'll get sick. How many was around here when brother Homer preached that sermon? &gt;&gt; Come on. You've been around here a long time, some of you. Brother Homer preached sermon like sheep are dumb. How many remember that one? [panting] For those that don't know, brother Homer was a founding pastor here. And listen, he was a fighter. And he taught us, I went to New Zealand and learned it, too. He taught us when sheep get sick, they get sores on them. Little home was a farmer. And he said they get sick and they get a sore on them. And then another sheep will say, "I'll fix it for them." Instead of letting the shepherd fix it, &gt;&gt; THEY GO LICKING ON THE son &gt;&gt; and then they get sick. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm going to fix my husband. Don't worry, baby. You can't fix yourself. &gt;&gt; I'm going to fix my wife. I done told you you can't fix yourself. &gt;&gt; I'm gonna go on a diet like everybody else. Well, I try. You're the one putting the FORK IN YOUR MOUTH. DON'T BLAME YOUR DOCTOR. NOW, I DIDN'T POINT AT YOU. I pointed. Everybody get so sensitive. He talking about my weight. [panting] I could lose if I had a shot. Well, get yourself a shot. Come walk with me three miles every day. &gt;&gt; That'll help you, baby. You better get good shoes. &gt;&gt; Sick. Sickness is being part of the battle. &gt;&gt; It's part of the battle. Brother Ron, I wish you'd have quit just a few minutes ago. No, I'm where I need to be right now. That's why you need to be in church. [applause] &gt;&gt; Cuz a pastor will see the sore that you got and he'll put a little saff on that for you. &gt;&gt; Now, the saff will heal you &gt;&gt; and he'll give you a shot of the word OF GOD. &gt;&gt; IT'LL HELP YOU. And then he's GOT TO GO FIX THE ONE THAT'S GOT A BELLY ache from licking on your soul. &gt;&gt; Good. Come on. &gt;&gt; Did that make any sense? &gt;&gt; Yeah, it did. Thank you, brother Ron. Brother Ron, I appreciate that. &gt;&gt; One more quote. Musicians come so I'm not a liar. When the weakest of Christians, weakest of Christians go on their knees. Everybody with me? Weakest of Christians go on their knees, the kingdom of God shakes. The kingdom of hell shakes. Let me explain something to you for we got a lot of new ones here. Brother Meadows is probably one of the oldest people in this building. Brother Meadows has been a warrior. &gt;&gt; He was a warrior in the military. He was a fighter during the war. He's been a warrior and and the results of that is his family is sprinkled all over this church. [snorts] One of his grandsons is my son-in-law. Brother Meadows is now age is creeping on him. He told me the other day I called him. I said, "How you doing, young man?" He said, "You need to look in the mirror. You're not a young man no more. Ain't that the truth, brother Metis? What I find is amazing in this church, Brother Meadows is at the stage, and I think he's honest with us, he can't remember what he had for breakfast. He has to have others take care of him. There was a time that he beat the drum. incredible drum player, &gt;&gt; incredible deacon in this church, incredible warrior. &gt;&gt; But he may not know your name or know who you are. &gt;&gt; All right. But as I preach, [applause] HE FINISHES QUOTES AND FINISHES SCRIPTURES &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE NAME OF THE LORD IS A STRONG TOWER AND THE RIGHTEOUS RUN INTO IT AND THEY ARE SAVED. [applause] &gt;&gt; Give the Lord a great big hand this morning. [cheering] HALLELUJAH. [applause] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [applause] When the Lord anoints a sermon, we know he's got a reason and he's got a purpose. I want to share one more thing to you. Brother Andrew was preaching last night. [snorts] Brother Andrew came to a certain spot last night and he said he started talking about rent and he was very he was trying to get us not to feel bad if we were renters. We've all done that. &gt;&gt; We've all done that. But he wasn't talking about property. &gt;&gt; He wasn't talking about property. He said, "But we don't want to be renters. We want to own it." &gt;&gt; And he's TALKING ABOUT THE PROMISES OF THE word of God. &gt;&gt; AND HE SAID, "WE DON'T want to rent forgiveness." Right. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN HE SAID THAT, I SAW THE PRESENCE OF GOD DROP ON this platform CUZ GOD WON'T DON'T WANT US TO BE CATHOLICS &gt;&gt; WHERE WE [screaming] PAY FOR FORGIVENESS &gt;&gt; AND GO TO SOME PRIEST AND ASK FOR FORGIVENESS OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. WHEN YOU ASK GOD FOR FORGIVENESS, &gt;&gt; IT'S AS THOUGH YOU NEVER DID IT IN the first place. &gt;&gt; You own it. IT'S MINE. IT'S MINE. IT'S MINE. IT'S MINE. IT'S MINE. Turn to your neighbor and say, "It's mine. It's mine." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Give the Lord [applause] another. Oh, the weapon may be formed, but it won't [music and singing] prosper. When the darkness falls, it won't prevail. Cuz [music] the God I serve knows only how to triump. [music and singing] Oh my God will never fail. [singing] Oh my [music] God will never fail.

So, I took my master's hand [music] and I joined that heavenly band. And I'm on the battlefield for my Lord. [music] Yes, I'm on the battlefield for my Lord.

Hallelujah. Why don't you turn around one more time? Shake one another's hand. Amen. Well, we got some weapons, don't we? &gt;&gt; Glory to God. It's very good. It's very good to to take a look around through the armor case every once in a while and pull out the AK-47. Sometimes Sometimes you got to pull out the machete for the job. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you got to pull out that Colt 45. Sometimes you got to go in there and get something a little bit bigger and pull out the judge itself and get a 45 and maybe 44 Magnum. &gt;&gt; I tell you, I gave Katie my 44 Magnum one time. I let her shoot all the pistols that I had. And when I got to that 45 44 Magnum, she shot it one time. Said, "That's that's all I need right there. I don't need to shoot it no more. I know what it can do." Let me tell you, there's only a few times that I've had to pull out certain scriptures, but when I've had to pull them out, I know that they're more than capable. &gt;&gt; I tell you, maybe maybe you need to pull out, maybe you pull it off your side right now, like an old western, LIKE OLD JESSE JAMES, AND PULL IT out and just let the devil know what you got on your side every once in a while. &gt;&gt; You ain't got to hide behind SOME VEST. YOU GOT THE ARMOR of the Holy Ghost upon you. [applause] Sometimes you got to get real close and personal to the devil. &gt;&gt; Just go ahead and jerk that sword right on out there. &gt;&gt; Slice that devil's head right off. &gt;&gt; What are you talking about? That's ugly. Absolutely not. That's what I was born to do. &gt;&gt; I was born TO PRAISE IN SUCH A WAY THAT MY PRAISE WOULD CUT THE DEVIL'S HEAD OFF. &gt;&gt; Some of you WERE BORN TO PREACH. SOME OF YOU WERE BORN TO CLAP YOUR HANDS. SOME OF YOU WERE BORN TO BE MAMAS, but you have a weapon &gt;&gt; that Satan cannot stop. &gt;&gt; I told brother Matthew while brother Ron was preaching. I said, "Go look up that quote blast words." Brother Brandham says, "Go and turn them blast words on the devil." That atomic faith. He said, "You know what it is?" He said, "It's thus SAYITH THE LORD." THAT'S WHAT YOU GOT TO TURN LOOSE ON THE DEVIL is turn loose the word. PULL THAT THING OUT. GET YOUR SICK SHOOTER OUT AND GO AHEAD AND start peppering that devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. I was the best cowboy in Pilot, Virginia when I was growing up. There wasn't nobody that could outgun me and Matthew Spencer. Raymond Reese even wrote a song about us. It was famous. I don't know if y'all ever heard it or not, but it was about the Spencer boys coming to town. probably went record. Probably broke the broke the internet. Went aluminum. Never hit platinum. But let me say this. I killed a whole lot of Indians in my imaginary world up there playing cowboys. &gt;&gt; But I ain't playing imaginary up here. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron ain't just wasting your time. HE IS SLAYING GIANTS ONE AT A TIME, BRINGING HIS SHEEP BACK IN. WHY? BECAUSE HE'S A DAVID AND HE KNOWS HOW TO FIGHT GIANTS AND HE KNOWS HOW TO FEED SHEEP AT THE SAME TIME. THAT'S WHAT MAKES A POWERFUL PASTOR. &gt;&gt; WOO! THIS AIN'T IMAGINARY. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN SEE IT OR NOT, BUT IN THE SUPERNATURAL REALM, THERE'S GIANTS LAYING [screaming] ALL OVER THIS ROOM. WHY? BECAUSE SOMEBODY HAD THE FAITH TO RISE UP AND SAY, "YOU KNOW WHAT? I GOT THE SAME FAITH THAT DAVID'S GOT, AND I GOT THE SAME STONE THAT HE'S GOT. I GOT THE SAME SLING THAT HE'S GOT AND I GOT THE SAME GIANT OUT THERE IN FRONT OF ME. AND THAT GIANT'S GOT TO COME DOWN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I feel like a preacher today. I feel like a son of God today. &gt;&gt; IT AIN'T WHETHER I FEEL LIKE IT OR NOT. I STILL GOT THE SAME HOLY GHOST &gt;&gt; THAT I FEEL RIGHT NOW &gt;&gt; IN THIS PULL PIT. YOU'LL HAVE THAT TOMORROW MORNING WHEN YOU WAKE UP AND THE REST OF THESE PEOPLE AIN'T AROUND YOU. THAT SAME HOLY GHOST WILL BE RIGHT THERE IN THE CAR WITH YOU. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. God bless you, brother Ron. &gt;&gt; I'm a warrior. [applause] I was I was a part of a sales call this week and the guy that was leading this sales call he got to telling about how that he was he said when I was in the commerce world he said I was sitting there and he said he said I would tell my my my salesmen that were underneath of me said look it gets awkward sometimes when you're talking to people and don't know he said so practice in the mirror he said actually practice in the mirror that's what you need to do sometimes Just go ahead and practice in the mirror of God's word &gt;&gt; and stand right there. I am a warrior. &gt;&gt; I am a warrior. &gt;&gt; I like the way that looked when I SAID THAT. I AM A WARRIOR. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I AM A SERPENT BRUISER. I AM YOU KNOW WHAT? I LIKE THE WAY I'M TALKING. I AM A DEVIL DESTROYER. I AM MORE THAN A CONQUEROR. I AM VICTORIOUS THROUGH THE BLOOD OF J. I AM. [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, "SAY IT until you believe it." &gt;&gt; And then WHEN YOU BELIEVE IT, EVERY DEVIL'S GOT TO MOVE out of its place. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Don't you love the Lord? &gt;&gt; Don't you love this message? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. [applause] Hallelujah. Let's sing. Blessed be the name of the Lord as we'll let the people be dismissed today. God bless you. We love you with the love of the Lord. Oh, blessed be the name of [music] the Lord. Oh, blessed be the name of [singing] the Lord. Blessed be the name of the Lord most [music] high. Oh, blessed [music] be the name of the Lord. Oh, blessed be the name [music and singing] of the Lord. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
