Brethren I count not myself to be apprehended have apprehended but this one thing that I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before I want to read that scripture again because I want you to get this today brethren account not myself to have apprehended but this one thing that I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before I pressed toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus whether you plan to be baptized or not be baptized today I want you to read this part with me forgetting those things which are behind reaching forth unto those things which are before I press towards the mark of the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus you may be seated this evening there was a noble King he was such a great lover had these subjects till one day before his guard and his royalty he said today you will see me for your last time for many years and his garden is Noble said to him a good King why do you say that are you going to a foreign country somewhere to become an alien no I'm staying right here I'm going out amongst my subjects I'm going to become a peasant I'm going to cut wood with the wood Chopper I'm going to till the ground with the taller I'm going to prune the vines with those who bring prune The Vines I'm going to be one with them in order to get a better acquainted with what they are doing I love them and I want to be more acquainted with them personally they don't know me but yet I want to be acquainted with them in that way and the next morning when the his delegates all of these people seen him the ones that was in the palace take off his crown and lay it down it upon his seed in the throne and take his robe off and put on peasants clothes and walk out amongst the common people now in that little story we found out then about God they said to the king king we want you we love you we want you to remain King but he said I want to become one of them to know them better and they would know him better really was he was how he would display himself I'd write he really was that's what God did he changed himself from being Jehovah God to become one of us that he might suffer and he might taste death that he might know what the sting of death was and to take the penalty of death upon himself and he laid aside his crown in his robe and became one of us he washed feet with the lowly he dwelt in tents with the poor he slept in the woods in the streets and those who were underprivileged he became one of us that he might understand us better and that we might understand him better you say well brother Ron that was 2 000 years ago what your experiencing today in her Services is God is Among Us he is with Housewives taking care of babies he's with husbands struggling to make a living he's with ministers and song leaders and musicians and and all of us that clap her hands and Worship the Lord listen to the word of God he wants to live in your life he's not 10 million miles away but he wants to live he wants not not to be a foreign King to you he wants to live in your life oh now let me just say this to you well brother Ron I want more of God well we're the one as human beings that are the one that hold the brakes on God because God wants to consume our life to so fill our lives brother Branham would use the terms so completely surrender ourselves to him until the devil don't know what to do with us he would use the term say completely enter ourself out yeah completely empty ourself out and let him fill us up with his life our purpose and our mission today is to get ourselves closer to God to re-examine where we're at the Readiness of the Bride for the bride will leave in the moment in the twinkling of an eye when the Rapture happens that's not going to be a change of nature that's going to happen here if you're a liar here you're going to be a liar somewhere else if you're a drunk here you're only reflecting where you came from so in this realm in this Mortal realm it's the place that you've got to get everything right now listen don't wait on another this is an individual walk God Saves Israel as a nation but he saves Gentiles as individuals so don't blame another don't wait on another in no way am I attempting to de-christianize anybody I'm not trying to throw a stone at anybody I'm trying to motivate you to rekindle the fire in your life to trim your lamps that it would be brighter than ever before to check up to make sure that everything is right sometimes as people we just don't start off right we get entangled in circumstances and influences of life that come in through the decades of serving the lord and we get stuff in our life Petty feelings in her life Petty jealousies in her life we look at others let me just say never lose your focus on keeping it on Jesus Christ my brother on this Minister did this to me and this man failed me and this one I'm sorry I apologize to him as I start I apologize for others failures where they misplaced you but don't bundle us all up together just because we've had a lot of nonsense don't bottle us all up in the same package there's going to be some real men of God there's going to be some real leaders that are going to be filled with the Holy Ghost foreign you as a brighter coming to your place you've been here for now quite a long time the appearance of the Lord has been among us but there's coming a coming where we'll see the physical Corporal return of Jesus Christ we'll see the resurrected debt we're trimming our lats maybe for the last time as a minister when God began to speak to me on this subject I I be honest with you I had to I had to stop and spend much time and prayer because if God is calling for a higher calling I think he's also expecting that of the ministry before you can present it to an audience you must be there for yourself but as we look around the world we see tragedies happen natural tragedies to our nation we see America in its moral condition Insanity no matter what party that you join let me just say insanity is everywhere our courthouses don't know how to rule our nation don't know how to vote Hollywood don't know what to do with all of what's going on Sodom and Gomorrah was at your local McDonald's and and Walmart it's everywhere it is permeated the atmosphere this is no world to stay in Russia I believe it was on Wednesday made their huge announcements that they have now taken in several different ah lands in Ukraine now it's a part of their own and now saying that they will use nuclear weapons even against the West we knew these things were coming this was not a shock wave that's come our way that Almighty we better get ready we've been getting ready for a long time we've been getting ready we had tomorrow's newspaper a long time ago we had a prophet and whether the America or the world wanted to recognize Malachi 4 5-6 we had a prophet to stand here and tell us what was going to happen this week next week the weeks after it's our job to step to our position and be ready the pope is doing what he's doing Britain is doing what it's doing we're all leaders are doing what they're doing Israel has the red heifers now they're preparing they can't they can't go forward until two prophets come two prophets can't come until you as a bride leave the Earth but Moses and Elijah will come and the bride will leave the Earth and the tribulation period will happen [Applause] your neighbors will miss you what happened to them they must have moved away they must have taken another job Life Will Go On The World will just get darker and darker and darker and darker but Israel there will be light and they will hear a message of the hour brother Branham could not preach the trumpets because the trumpets would be coming to to them through the prophets of that day we would get our message because we heard it and the reason we could hear it was with a predestinated seed that was on the inside of us we couldn't make ourselves seed we were already seen to start off with and the reason it sounds so good to us it sounds like home [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah Paul would say it like this Romans chapter 12 and verse 1 I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy and acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service I may not conformed to this world but may you transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may be able to prove what is the good and acceptable and the perfect will of God the scripture tells us as a man think us in his heart so is he if you're defeated so you will be but brother Ron I get so much resistance in my life let me just say expect resistance expect to Fight for Your Life let me give you a natural example sometimes we have to reinvent ourselves a man named Colonel Sanders at 65 years old there was a an incredible Interstate that went by his way they did not put an exit ramp near him and so he was going bankrupt so he began to put his Fried Chicken in the back in the back of of his old station wagon and take it to be sold at local places the rest is history bankrupt at 65 but he didn't set accept defeat by Ada he had traveled the world he had been knighted in a lot of places he had been recognized among Kings as one of the most recognizable men in the world 88 years old to pass away a multi-million dollar Legend Glenn Cunningham was burned as a boy burned and his stay actually one to amputate his legs and take his legs off of him and and he said absolutely don't take my legs off and and you know he would he would he had gotten burned and he would roll himself out in a wheelchair and roll out into the yard and he would sit there and watch all the other children go by and you know he could have accepted sitting in that wheelchair the rest of his life but one day he pulled himself up that's what I want you to do this morning pull yourself up one day he pulled himself up and said I'm not gonna sit here no more feeling sorry for myself I'm not going to have a pity party for myself I'm gonna pull myself up I'm going to stand as long as I can stand he turned it he started taking step after step after step after step One Step led to another step another step led to another step and before long he was running Glenn Cunningham became the first four minute miler sometimes your tests may be more than you can stand right but it's no time to have a pity party [Applause] you've got to press don't look at the circumstances around you God is greater than your circumstances he's greater than your cancer he's greater than what the doctors are telling you God's greater [Applause] in the words of Jesus he said then this the shelter chapter 25 of Matthew verse 1. then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened unto ten virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom five of them were wise and five were foolish and they that were foolish took their lamps and took no all with them but the wise took all in their vessels which is the Holy Ghost and and while the bridegroom bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept and at midnight there was a crime made behold the bridegroom cometh go you out to meet him and all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps [Music] and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your awe for our lamps are gone out God don't move in our church no more we don't see the mother of God move I don't care what denomination is if God's not moving you there's people don't dress right and you've got a compromise they're standing in the Pulpit a politician he's not only selling his soul he's selling yours brother Branham said at the Judgment there will be a lot of disappointments he said the drunk won't be disappointed The Prostitute won't be disappointed but people that have put their trust in a system they're going to be disappointed I don't want to be disappointed for Thessalonians chapter 5 and verse 1. we know that this is immediately following the Rapture chapter but of the times of the Season brethren you have no need that are right unto you for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord is at the thief in the night and when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with a child sister Gabriel is not here this morning but she knows what travail is like right now she's having contractions because there's a child that's being forced from that comfortable place don't know what it's going to get into but there's a nature that's forcing that baby that baby can hear the heartbeat that baby can that is nourished by the mama but it's getting ready to be pushed into a new life this world is not our home don't get comfortable here it's good to have houses and homes or tents or whatever you got but let me just say don't get comfortable here don't get comfortable with this flesh there's a new body that's waiting on us it's a better land there's no murders there's no sickness there's no hospitals there's no disappointments there's not a time clock nobody does [Applause] no nursing homes no Undertakers now no winter no fall seasons Peter stood up on the day of inauguration Acts chapter 2. Andrew spoke about last night David and Moses and Daniel long to have the presence of God in them the anointing of God would come down on them and they would feel God they would feel God even at times see God even see the effects of God but Daniel knew Daniel Moses knew down Moses David knew David they knew their mistakes and they knew their failures but they longed for a day where the god of Heaven that had walked with them would one day live on the inside of them that's what God wants to do to you he don't want to just walk with you he don't want us not want just a church relationship with you he wants to live on the throne room of your heart now let's just remember there were some days that Peter was naked causing and Jesus picked him there were some days that you was a lot of stuff so hang your wings [Music] well brother Ron I don't need Jesus prepare for help you don't need Jesus prepare for help when you're standing at the Judgment Jesus said I came by your way by sermons my songs my scriptures my poetry my books I made a way for you and you turned it all down so you got to go to hell you listen you're the one that sends yourself to hell don't blame God don't blame preachers well I didn't get an education teachers must have been dumb then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized stay in the program either stay in the program Evan God knows your name I'll forget it 40 000 times but you have a good time at Disney I'd like to stay there myself and then Peter said unto them repent repentance is not because you got caught yeah a lot of these celebrities after they get caught go to rehab centers I now do it they'll do it time and time and time and time again they'll get in the front of a mic I want you to know about wife I'm so sorry there was a moment it was a trap they go to the pope and repent they'll go to their favorite preacher repent only to repeat the process but when you truly repent come on somebody help me preach this morning when you truly repent you never go back again and baptized which is my immersion not by sprinkling you on the head because your old man is dead so when I'm when a man dies in The Natural we don't take him to the Grave pull up a little grass and go [Music] [Applause] there is federal rate of Galatians saying you bury him six foot deep in our area some places they put concrete on them but let me just say this to you in true baptism that word baptism comes from baptismal and it is it is the same meaning as taking a pickle a cucumber and make it in a pickle a pickle will never reproduce the Cucumber again because it's went through a process and if you've been truly repented and you've been truly filled with the Holy Ghost God will fill you with the Holy Ghost and if you're truly sealed you'll never go back to your original estate again there's a lot of people get baptized in a lot of different names but there's only one form of true scriptural King James Version in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because this is a form of your marriage certificate well I don't want to take on his name so they'll take on a Church's name well you're just his girlfriend let's just be honest you've only signed your name on a book that's no more than becoming a mason I'm talking about true conversion I'm talking about true scriptural conversion brother Ron I want to argue let me just say forget your time don't waste your time you're not arguing with me I didn't write the book [Applause] now notice what it says for the remission that's not just your sins but that's all your father's sins and mother's sins because all there's passed down so somewhere the Cycle's got to be broken well brother Ron in my family we had temper if you truly repent and you truly are baptized and you truly filled with the Holy Ghost there's an adoption cycle in that that breaks the cycle [Applause] and the remission revokes the jurisdiction of Satan we are a slave no longer oh for the promises unto you and to you children I look at my grandbaby sitting here in Daughters of the church sitting across this audience I am thrilled to see what God is producing in this hour there are lighthouses to the community you're a lighthouse to this community for the promises unto you and to your children and to all that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call laughs now there's a there's a mythical and I I gotta I gotta use this just for an example there's a thing called Phoenix is something that can rise up out of nothing we got a lot of phoenixes in this building we got a lot of faith is this microphone working at all we got a lot of phoenixes in this building means that something has risen from nothing because many of you were making choices taking you away from God and those choices were taking you further and further in sin and destroying your life but God rich in Mercy for in his great love he redeemed you and he raised you like a phoenix out of nothing because God saw something in you when man said there's nothing there to be had [Applause] the prophet says that's what God does he takes nothing and raises it up and makes something out of it New Life I'm absolutely sure today I'm positive to today that today there's going to be new life racing out of Ashes I say this reverently God spoke to me about a renewing like a fresh drink for the king like a fresh washing and it kept coming to me over and over and over again I spoke it the other day here before we left to go to Brother Kelly's and it wasn't on the internet of how God was dealing for us to have a service like today of renewing New Beginnings from this point a fresh start a fresh drink for the king like a fresh washing you know I took I've taken I took a bath this morning you'd like to say thank you for those that will be getting in the tub and you'd like you don't want to smell me but I took a I took a fresh shower this morning and you know I put soap in my hat for those that I put soap in my head and and then I put I I put a conditioner in there sister Heather taught me that and then I bathed myself was it because I thought I really needed it because I knew I needed it sometimes in life as decades go on of serving God little things begin to creep into our lives and we need a fresh washing I was driving around at UVA the other day after several appointments on Tuesday and then on Wednesday and it was on Wednesday I had a service laid out for Brother Kelly's I thought that was a service I prayed I prayed diligently about Brother Kelly's meeting and God spoke to me the fact that this message and it wasn't it didn't go anything like this this morning but renewing would be the subjects that I would that I would speak at Brother Kelly's and as I stood at the pulpit with a new sermon to preach and God dealing with me I just knew that if I did my part god would do his that's what I know this morning if I do my part gotta do his and and so as I began to come to the end of the service I came down to the end and and if I can say this reverently I came down to the end and I felt the presence on the stage and I turned and as it looked like a man standing behind me and then it was wave after wave and hundreds came to the altar rejoicing begin to take place and prayer began to happen and rededication rekindling of the flame only God can do what he's doing today It's Not Just Happening Here it's happening all over the world it is because God's Gathering his wife and getting her ready Church we're not from this world we're being called to another world what Adam stepped out of we're going to step into I want to be very solemn with you foreign ly got some names that have come in in the last two weeks of people that said I just feel like quitting and thank God none from here but if you feel like quitting this is for you quitting is not an option you can quit football man you can quit voting you can quit going to the doctor you can quit your job you can quit loving your wife it's because you don't love God if you love God you'll always love her it's both ways but serving God quitting is not an option so I want to tell you the spirit that's telling you to quit is not from God why don't you just turn to your neighbor and tell them say Quentin that is not an option here so so since I'm here where are you going to go okay okay let's just all right all right I just want to have a personal interview with you okay you want to quit where are you going okay brother random wasn't right is Nostradamus he's your next best option going back to smoking doing cocaine going to a church where you can wear booty shorts where your husband sits and lust after your neighbor [Music] going back to pornography as it is well brother on I'm too busy to go to church what are you busy doing [Applause] well my friends really well there's not going to be any friends in hell well my my clothes my clothes in my closet there's not going to be any clothes in hell you imagine what an ugly Place hell's going to be with all them naked ugly bodies let me just say Marilyn Monroe down there don't look like she did uphill [Applause] [Music] [Applause] them things that's in Hollywood they ain't gonna look the same down there in hell because they ain't gonna have spies down there keeping their body on [Applause] [Music] naked in hell is where they're gonna be and there's not going to be one friend in Hell there's not going to be no parties there ain't going to be no God in hell [Applause] if you do see somebody that you spent much time in life and parted with they're going to blame you for helping them get here and they're not going to love you so let me just say don't turn down the preacher while there's still time while I'm still here [Applause] the same bomb that will bomb Washington D.C will bomb here I'm not saying that because I think it I'm saying that because I know it because I have carried a classification to know that so Wednesday's meeting in Russia has much significance for America this meeting in heaven has much significance because the quicker we get out of the way the quicker he can drop his bombs [Applause] and if he's screaming to drop his bombs why not say God liken the first Exodus Let's cross the Red Sea and grab a tambourine the God of this world offers nothing but destruction he offers you a kingdom without a Calvary he offers your religion without a message he offers you a message without a birth he offers you preachers with intellectual conceptions preaching you all different kinds of thoughts and opinions even about the message but what about men of God that'll preach a new birth but many want to say well let's get past the New Birth really it's your adoption it should be celebrated it should be lived in and rejoice then but like John's eyes became filmed over even brother Branham wanted to go to the mountains and stay but God had to tell him I'll leave you the pressures of this life makes this world so unfit to live in we're so uncomfortable foreign sometimes when I go shopping with sister Connie she says I'm a better Shopper than her because I spend more money I walked in a hunting store the other day with Adam and he never been a diamond I spent a hundred and twelve dollars I don't know how that worked out but sometimes when you walk into I'm sorry sister Connie I did it we walk into a score and we just become uncomfortable with the atmosphere will get weary we get overwhelmed I know I'm talking to some of you and if we're not careful we'll get entangled I ride through our Woods I got a golf cart my grandbabies love to ride up through the woods with me and when we ride through if my windshield's not up spider webs are getting my face I don't like them I'll be the first to tell you that I don't like spiders and I don't like snakes I don't like mice and I don't like hypocrites [Applause] but so many times circumstances of life tangle us to worry if you make a mistake today tomorrow you know the devil is the kind of guy that will stack odds against you and he'll get you into a situation and your friends will get you in trouble listen some of your friends that are so close to you will get you in trouble and then the devil will come along and he'll get another into trouble and then he goes and then you can't unload I'm coming to an end now and sometimes you come to a spot to where how can I get out of this spot now I'm going to be very honest with you I was raised in the message we listened to a tape after tape every day by my grandfather and my mother my mother and my grandfather my mother and my daddy excuse me how did I get tangled there my dad was a was a kind of man that would speak in tongues through the night and real experience of God many of you knew him but growing up growing up in a in a in a home were messages taught believed churches every week don't make you born again and I knew the stories and I knew the situations and I you know nobody had to convince me that God sent a prophet as a matter of fact one of the worst fights I was ever in was in a bar room don't tell nobody but somebody called brother Branham a false prophet Reuben something went through me I was I was drunk and something went through me it didn't end up good I may be five foot five but I know how to fight and listen when you're five foot five listen you can't afford to lose foreign it's like Mike Tyson said Everybody's Got A Plan until they get hit in the nose and I was in a very bad spot and I'm talking about a really bad spot and I thought there was no way out and I'll be honest with you brother Fred I thought there was no way out I knew what was right but I thought there was no way out well you see there was no way for me to get out now a lot of people don't want to tell you this part of their life they want to put on a masquerade show you the now but let me take you back when I was a boy when something like where some of you are and some of you are on the internet let me say you can't get yourself out but what I'm presenting to you is a Jesus [Applause] and he spoke to me on a certain night and he said Ron are you ready to come home and I remembered the prodigals Sun story and I repeated back to him God I can't get out but you got to help me get out the next morning there was a knock on the door with garbage bags and it was my unconverted uncle standing there and he said Ron it's time to go home [Music] the rest is history it didn't happen overnight but the rest is history I call Sister Connie I said Connie you haven't seen me in 18 months and I've been a really bad boy and you have every right in the world to hate me your daddy your mama your church has every right to hate me little did I know I'd be preaching to you now 23 years as a pastor isn't God wonderful Kenny ain't God good I said I'm going to get baptized it had flooded and said you're sure you want to get baptized I said this can't wait River's muddy anyway just can't wait I told Connie I said would you would you come I drove I drove here they lived in the big house I picked her up we hardly said a word all the way up the road matter of fact she didn't want to talk to me and I didn't know what to say to her she really didn't want to talk to me and I understood she'd been hurt that's what hurt people do they get hurt Terry Horn we baptized I wore our Old Yeller pullover now walk down in that watery grave I'm scared plumbed to the death of water and I walked down into that watery grave and it was up to my chest and I looked at Terry and I said don't lose me honestly I told him that don't lose me I don't know what happened but somewhere between going down and coming up something happened there's a lot of things about the new birth I can't explain but I can tell you when you meet Jesus Cara everything's different brother Terry Horn we went to the church to change her clothes and brother Terry Horn reached up in the tape library and he pulled out a tape called choosing of a bride he said I noticed you two aren't talking but maybe maybe you'd like to listen to this on your way down the road so instead of Connie and Ronald talking brother Branham talked for two hours on choosing of a bride and of course said you've heard it and I'll just repeat some of this God's looking for somebody that will reflect his character he's not looking for a church that wants to fit theirs because God wants to become the king of your heart and he wants a bride that will dress like him and talk like him and walk like him and live like him and you know we went to service that night and if I remember right I was I was sitting beside of you I got to sit beside of you and and I set beside of her in church and I think we sat with the Linda team Linda Hinkle and Linda Kelly and I'll never forget this Linda Kelly said I look like Tom Selleck I never saw that in the mirror now I'm honored to look like Teddy Roosevelt but I never have saw Tom's self and I sit there very confused in a few weeks my life has changed and I don't know what to do with my life what's going to happen with my life maybe like you sitting here this morning in New Beginnings okay where do I go from here yeah New Beginnings is a start over maybe a closet has to be rearranged and your music has to be rearranged but don't worry God will take care of that and you're lying and you're cheating and you're and you're lusting in your porn habits and all of those things have to be rearranged in your life and God's rich in Mercy Hallelujah [Applause] I think this is October the 2nd so for today for that Joe that those of you that want a new beginning I'd like for you to mark this on your calendar in the Old Testament they would they would build an altar where they met God now I'm not being Christian now as you've said here for 30 years I I'm not de-christianizing your walk but maybe you just want to step closer you know you I don't live with you you know you I I'm not going to try to discern you so many times people want you to discern them you know you you know your name you know your address you know your situations but you know that you need more of Jesus no matter where you're at in the world and you hear this sermon and there's a renewal for you and God's asking one more time I don't know how many more times that we'll have to do this but I'll never forget this and let me just share this one more thing my brother that is now a pastor I remember I'll never forget walking up to him and he said I said Mark don't waste another day and he said but I've got so many excuses I said tell me one that's worth missing heaven amen tell me one friend I like living a life of no regret now you might regret eating a donut but I don't regret serving God I do not regret serving God because no matter how bad the doctors report is God's got this [Applause] rekindling is like putting fresh wood on a fire brother Branham warned us to never warm ourselves by painted fire we're preparing for rapture listen there's zero unconverted people going turn to your neighbor say zero unconverted people going outside the ark they drown but God preached to him 120 years who are you going to blame staying in Egypt was not the answer this message is more than just to be associated with it this is more than a spectator sport [Music] God has no grandchildren so we don't want rotten eggs [Music] maybe what you've got is not holding you and you just need a fresh drink for the king listen I want him to do more than walk with me and talk with me [Music] he's worth living for [Music] God takes me by the way of the grave I don't want to be a coward when I come to that spot that's what brother Brown said but my aspiration of life is is I stand here and as I preached my last sermon we'll begin to see the dead race and people come Among Us and our bodies begin to be changed so there's some unpacking that maybe you have to do unpack jealousy unpack Envy unpack bitterness toward one another we're going to set at the marriage supper of the Lamb foreign more than I know it's not going to be really any credit to you but no Jesus you say well brother Ron New Beginnings well brother Rhonda is that in the scripture or is that in a quote sure it's on your calendar new days new months New Seasons it's in your history books new chapters in your life God's calling you to a higher octave to serve him in a greater way God wants to make more than a church member out of you he wants to be the king of your heart [Music] he wants to cut wood with the wood Chopper [Music] and that Chopper might be you foreign Marcus I don't know what your plans are today but I thought of you as God dealt with me [Music] about 20 years ago we sat on an airplane [Music] and we had the opportunity to talk and you told me in what a tough spot that you was in sharing that information with me you didn't tell me your life story but you told me enough that let me know that you had been in the message told me about the woman in Memphis and the woman speaking the storm out of existence [Music] I would go to meetings and tell that I met a man on an airplane and I've been praying for it a couple of months ago it came to me as you were sitting at the table beside of me beside of Timothy that she was the man that man that I personally had been looking for but you see you you may have been absent from my eyesight help me preach but you were never absent from God's eyesight let me just say this to you you might be wondering in life [Music] you may be a prodigal this morning but God never forgets you he's watching over your life knows where you're at but there'd be one today that said I need a new beginning in my life I'd like to just raise my hand before God [Music] I want you to sincerely invite him to the throne room of your heart right there where you're at foreign we could come to this altar this morning but he wants to come to yours [Music] I want you to repent I don't care how long you've been a Christian but I don't want you to say father I've got slack on some things are some things that have prepped into my life and I want

things about himself that I'm sure he was ashamed of there's some things in our lives that we are definitely not of not proud of but God you're rich in your mercy where we got slack and where we got
