[20:09] request you'd like to lift up to the
[20:11] Lord this morning I'm going to ask
[20:12] brother Gabriel Spencer if he would just
[20:14] come pray for these needs for us this
[20:24] morning I just want to say thank you to
[20:26] everybody for the prayers last week for
[20:27] the the ones traveling as well as for
[20:29] our pastor and you know I thought it was
[20:31] pretty special just talking about how
[20:33] special group we have as children it's a
[20:36] youth camp you know you've got 500 kids
[20:38] there and you've got workers there that
[20:41] they have camps coming in camps coming
[20:43] out and they see they see the kids and
[20:45] um I happened to go back with brother
[20:47] Ron took him back and when we took him
[20:50] back I kind of walked back to where I
[20:51] was staying at and it just happened to
[20:53] be guided by God that that would happen
[20:55] um as I'm walking back there's a PA
[20:59] workers they older couple uh they were
[21:01] walking up and they kind of called out
[21:03] to me and uh they said you know hey we
[21:06] just wanted to talk to somebody here at
[21:08] the camp we see all the kids we see them
[21:11] hanging out and you know the girls and
[21:13] they're they're holding hands and in
[21:14] groups and the older kids are so well
[21:16] behaved and just bragging on the kids
[21:19] and they hadn't heard the message at all
[21:20] they didn't hear what was being preached
[21:22] but they saw the life that that the
[21:24] young kids all across the bride was
[21:26] living and so they they began asking me
[21:29] what you know what we believed and got
[21:31] to talk to them a little bit about what
[21:32] we believed and they said you know for
[21:35] people to come so far there was there
[21:36] was two boys that drove 32 hours from
[21:39] Canada and they said for for people to
[21:41] drive that far to come in here y'all
[21:43] must have something worth hearing and so
[21:46] they asked what time service was they
[21:48] had just went through a tragedy lost a
[21:50] home in a hurricane and were just there
[21:52] working at the camp and then so they
[21:54] ended up coming to the service that
[21:55] evening just to hear hear what was being
[21:57] preached on Friday night you know you
[21:59] don't you don't know what and whether
[22:01] they got something from it or or what
[22:03] their mind is I believe that God touched
[22:05] their heart in that but to see that we
[22:07] had a group of kids there that showed
[22:10] God so much that they would want to come
[22:12] and hear what message was being preached
[22:13] is very powerful very powerful and also
[22:16] again just praying for a pastor he he
[22:19] surrenders his life for this message and
[22:21] you know we're seeing that right before
[22:23] our eyes he's fighting cancer he has a
[22:25] heart attack and if it was his choice
[22:27] he'd be here preaching this morning and
[22:29] that's that's what he is that's who he
[22:31] does and he's he's a true servant he's
[22:33] living the he's living as a preacher and
[22:35] a servant that the scripture talked
[22:36] about when when Jesus came so let's just
[22:39] take these kns to the
[22:41] Lord gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're
[22:44] just so grateful to be able to come and
[22:45] be here this morning and to be able to
[22:48] come and come and be able to to listen
[22:50] to a message and have a message brought
[22:52] forth in this day where there's such
[22:54] evil around there's there's technologies
[22:56] that can take our kids can can take
[22:58] adults into places that will cause them
[23:00] to cause them to live a wicked life and
[23:03] to be able to live a life that you don't
[23:04] have to say a word but you could just F
[23:06] the feel the evil presence about them
[23:08] and that's the time we live in but Lord
[23:10] there's a message that comes that we
[23:12] just have a life that we have to live
[23:14] and it will it will draw folks that
[23:16] they've been around churches they've
[23:17] been around religions but there's
[23:19] there's just something different about
[23:21] the group of people that we have and I'm
[23:23] not just talking about the church and
[23:25] the youth that we have here we have such
[23:26] a great group of people a great faith
[23:28] believing people here but all around the
[23:31] world Lord you brought us a message you
[23:32] brought us a bride and not everyone may
[23:34] see it but we're thankful that they that
[23:36] they recognize that that is Jesus Christ
[23:38] living within them and Lord Jesus all
[23:40] the prayer requests that have been
[23:41] brought forth I'm believing that you
[23:43] could come and you could just touch each
[23:44] and everyone you could come and you
[23:46] could heal everyone in a moment Lord it
[23:48] may come in stages it may come in the
[23:50] exact moment we pray but Lord Jesus you
[23:52] are the god that that heals all that
[23:54] delivers all and brings prodigal home
[23:56] Lord and I'm just believing that you
[23:57] even go to our our pastor is Adam you
[24:00] could go and give him a supernatural
[24:01] strength like never before you came with
[24:03] a wind when he was listening to a
[24:05] meeting and you touched his lungs and
[24:07] you healed his lungs in a moment after
[24:08] the fire and I'm believing you could do
[24:10] the same for his heart and for his
[24:11] muscles and even for the cancer just
[24:13] wipe it all out there's a purpose behind
[24:16] it and there's one thing we could say
[24:17] here at Full Gospel Lighthouse we have a
[24:20] we have a pastor that lives this message
[24:22] and shows that this message Works he
[24:24] shows that it's battle tested and he's
[24:26] not doing that for the glory of him but
[24:28] for the Glory of you and so he could be
[24:29] a help to others and and I just know
[24:31] I've seen it and our our congregation
[24:33] have seen it and Lord I just ask that
[24:35] you would just touch our pastor this
[24:36] morning and go in touch brother Andrew
[24:38] as he brings forth the word it's such a
[24:40] powerful sermon last night that we all
[24:42] need to apply to our lives now Lord
[24:44] Jesus just come and anoint this service
[24:46] this morning anoint the words allow them
[24:48] come to life and just be able to allow
[24:50] us to draw higher and bring a faith like
[24:52] never before we're just so thankful for
[24:54] what you were about to do in Jesus name
[24:56] I pray amen

[32:40] same and you'll never be filled till
[32:45] you're
[32:47] empty until you're broken you'll never
[32:51] be
[32:53] home until the Potter has tried Your
[32:58] Vessel with
[33:00] fire you'll never come forth as pure
[33:06] gold I didn't know how much he loved me
[33:12] until I passed through the storm and

[45:23] Lord in prayer this morning Heavenly
[45:25] Father we we beseech your presence Lord
[45:28] Jesus the god that wrote the word father
[45:32] the god that said in the very beginning
[45:34] Let There Be and there was father Lord
[45:37] we recognize Lord that we're not in the
[45:39] presence of just mortal men Lord these
[45:42] are the redeemed of god father you
[45:45] thought of these children father before
[45:47] the foundation of the world they have
[45:50] something on the inside of them that has
[45:52] attracted them to you father I pray
[45:55] father that today Lord when would be so
[45:58] special for each and every one of us
[46:00] father you know how just to be personal
[46:03] to us you know how to make yourself real
[46:05] father and how to come to the level that
[46:08] we are on Father some needing salvation
[46:11] some just needing deeper Revelation
[46:14] father I believe that you can be God
[46:16] from the little child all the way to the
[46:18] eldest person in this building today and
[46:21] Father I just invite you father to come
[46:23] and take the word just now begin to
[46:26] Express who you are to us oh God and
[46:29] begin to take us Lord from from Genesis
[46:31] to Revelations father and to show us who
[46:34] we are in our position as sons of God
[46:37] lord we stand here as a body of
[46:39] Believers holding our pastor brother Ron
[46:41] before you father Lord a mighty man Lord
[46:45] that needs a touch from the master today
[46:47] I pray that you would surround him with
[46:49] the glory of God the healing that you
[46:52] paid for 2,000 years ago I pray father
[46:55] that the angel of the Covenant would
[46:57] just sweep into the room where he is
[46:59] there father and Surround him with your
[47:01] glory and strengthen him in his
[47:03] innermost being father Lord not just not
[47:06] just coming out of surgeries and out of
[47:09] a heart attack but coming down from a
[47:10] meeting the taxation of that upon a body
[47:13] father it can be so so heavy on one
[47:17] father so father you see every detail of
[47:20] his energy of his body and I pray father
[47:22] that you would just go through the blood
[47:25] cells of Ron Spencer right now and let
[47:28] creation take its perfect work in its
[47:30] body in the name of Jesus Christ we pray
[47:34] that you'd be with him and bless this
[47:36] service today in the name of Jesus
[47:38] Christ amen Joshua 5 and verse 11 and
[47:44] they did eat of the old corn of the land
[47:46] on the tomorrow after the Passover
[47:49] unleavened cakes and parts corn in the
[47:52] self same day and the Mana ceased on the
[47:55] tomorrow after they had eaten of the old
[47:57] corn of the land neither had the
[47:59] children of Israel Mana anymore but they
[48:01] did eat of the fruit of the land of
[48:04] Canaan that year and it came to pass
[48:06] that when Joshua was by Jericho that he
[48:09] lifted up his eyes and behold there
[48:11] stood a man over against him with his
[48:15] sword drawn in his hand and Joshua went
[48:18] unto him and said unto him art thou for
[48:22] us or for our
[48:25] adversaries and he said n but as the
[48:27] captain of the host of the Lord am I now
[48:31] come and Joshua fell on his face to the
[48:35] Earth and did worship and said unto him
[48:38] what saith my Lord unto his servant to
[48:41] me this is one of the most beautiful
[48:43] scriptures that there is that God can
[48:45] take you from the place that you are and
[48:48] make you a worshipper I love this
[48:51] scripture because Joshua is what we know
[48:53] as a man of war but immediately in these
[48:57] moments of the presence of the Lord
[48:59] Joshua becomes a worshipper and I
[49:02] believe that no matter where you are no
[49:04] matter what your your state or your
[49:06] career of life is that God when he shows
[49:09] up that he desires you to worship Him
[49:13] and the captain of the Lord's host said
[49:16] unto Joshua loose thy shoe from off thy
[49:19] foot for the place where on thou
[49:21] standest is Holy and Joshua did so I
[49:26] think that's beautiful right there I
[49:28] think it's really beautiful is that God
[49:30] gives the commandment and then Joshua
[49:32] follows it I think it's really powerful
[49:34] things that we just read over sometimes
[49:36] how powerful that it is is that God
[49:39] doesn't just give us a Commandment that
[49:41] God doesn't just give us a rule God
[49:42] doesn't just give us a word but the
[49:44] power in your life is you obeying that
[49:47] word of God Deuteronomy chapter 20 and
[49:50] verse one and the Bible said when thou
[49:53] goest out to battle against thine
[49:54] enemies and SE us horses and chariots
[49:57] and a people more than thou be not
[50:00] afraid of them for the Lord thy God is
[50:03] with thee which brought thee up out of
[50:06] the land of Egypt and it shall be when
[50:08] you are come nigh unto the battle that
[50:11] the priest shall approach and speak unto
[50:13] the
[50:14] people and shall say unto them here o
[50:17] Israel you approach this day under the
[50:20] battle against your enemies let not your
[50:22] hearts faint fear not and do not tremble
[50:25] neither be ye terrified because of them
[50:29] for the Lord your God is he that goeth
[50:33] with you to fight for you against your
[50:35] enemies and to save you may God bless
[50:38] his word you may be seated in the
[50:40] presence of the Lord and I would like to
[50:42] speak to you from this context today I
[50:45] would like to speak to you on a thought
[50:47] on the angel goes before you and your
[50:51] Victory is sure the angel goes before
[50:55] you and your victory Victory is sure
[50:57] ain't that a wonderful thing to know
[50:59] that if he's before us that our Victory
[51:02] is sure and now we know that as Bible
[51:04] students and message Believers we we
[51:07] we've studied the words of God and we we
[51:09] understand that God and believe that God
[51:11] has Legions of Angels at his dispersal
[51:15] and throughout the span of time that God
[51:17] has allowed Humanity to be able to look
[51:19] out and to see these angels as they've
[51:22] came into existence and anytime that
[51:25] anytime that we see an angel or we see
[51:27] we see them show up in the scripture
[51:29] it's a signal or it's a sign that there
[51:32] is a junction at hand and God allows men
[51:35] to be able to a be able to fellowship
[51:38] and to be able to converse and to sit
[51:40] down and feel the very effect and than
[51:43] the influence of that Heavenly realm
[51:45] because we recognize that when an angel
[51:47] shows up that it's aign to a generation
[51:50] that God is getting ready to do the
[51:52] miraculous that God is getting ready to
[51:54] change over and you watch what is
[51:57] happening with Joshua that that he goes
[51:59] from this spot of eating this is the
[52:01] last day that he eats of the old corn of
[52:04] the land of the Mana that fell so God is
[52:07] taking him in to a different position
[52:10] God is taking him further into into his
[52:13] inheritance now notice that we know this
[52:16] that that that the angels of God are
[52:19] encamped about the children of God
[52:21] brother Bram would say it like this in
[52:23] expectation and what love is he said May
[52:25] the angels of Heaven come down through
[52:28] off of the ladder of Jacob and take
[52:30] their position now as soldiers at their
[52:33] post of Duty setting every place every
[52:36] corner every place and take their
[52:38] positions and may they not leave this
[52:41] building until the Revival o is over and
[52:45] I pray that that that is the same exact
[52:47] way here this morning that the angels of
[52:49] God would come and take their position
[52:52] and that that they would not leave their
[52:54] position until you have your personal
[52:56] Revival until you come to your full
[52:59] victory in Christ until you come to your
[53:01] personal experience I pray that the
[53:03] angels of God would come here today and
[53:06] watch you worship and watch you praise
[53:08] and and watch you come to your position
[53:10] as sons of God those angels are in their
[53:13] position but they're watching and
[53:15] waiting to draw you into your position
[53:17] because Angels the angels of God are
[53:20] here and are here on purpose and their
[53:23] purpose is to draw you not into their
[53:25] presence but the Angel's purpose is to
[53:28] draw you into Jesus Christ's presence
[53:31] because their presence is only something
[53:34] that signals us that there is a
[53:36] supernatural realm here but if we can
[53:38] get in the presence of Christ it won't
[53:41] just change our demeanor it won't just
[53:43] change our outside but it'll change our
[53:45] Outlook it'll change our soul it'll
[53:48] change our body we don't want to just be
[53:50] be people of words we want to be people
[53:53] of Destiny we don't want to just be
[53:55] people that say the right thing we want
[53:57] to be the kind of people that live the
[53:59] right kind of things we don't want to be
[54:00] the people that stand around and say
[54:03] what the prophet said we want to stand
[54:05] there and live what the prophet said and
[54:07] if angels are at every corner and taking
[54:10] their positions how much more as Sons
[54:13] and Daughters of God should we rise to
[54:15] our
[54:16] position
[54:18] Hallelujah William Barham said in a
[54:20] spoken word is the Original Seed he said
[54:22] the spoken word of God is a seed it's
[54:25] got to come back to this word and that
[54:27] word will produce what it says he said
[54:30] that's the reason that I believe in
[54:31] Divine Healing he said that's the reason
[54:34] that I believe in Visions that's the
[54:36] reason that I believe in angels He said
[54:38] that's the reason I believe this message
[54:40] is because it comes from the very word
[54:42] of God that's the reason why we preach
[54:45] the message that's the reason why we
[54:47] preach that God's got a holy ghost for
[54:49] you it's because it comes straight from
[54:52] the word of God and I believe that you
[54:54] can trace your very existence
[54:56] all the way back to the word of God and
[54:59] I believe if you've not spent much time
[55:01] in the word of God I believe that you
[55:02] ought to do it because I believe that's
[55:04] what Christians do that's the right
[55:06] thing that Christians do no matter what
[55:08] they do no matter what they say they
[55:10] always bring everything back to the word
[55:12] of God and if they ain't correct in the
[55:15] matter they'll take it back to the word
[55:17] of God and repent of that matter but I
[55:19] believe that you can you can trace your
[55:21] very existence back to the word of God
[55:24] and when you go to searching out your
[55:26] hisory history and searching out your
[55:27] inheritance and searching out your
[55:29] heritage that you'll find that you came
[55:32] from the very mind of God and I believe
[55:34] that's why Joshua could stand there with
[55:36] such a fervency in his heart as a leader
[55:39] of all of Israel he could stand there
[55:42] because he knew that he was called by
[55:44] almighty God he was elected to stay with
[55:47] the word of God and that's one thing
[55:49] that God is always look for in every
[55:52] generation and in every time that God
[55:54] has always looked in every age for
[55:56] somebody that will believe him against
[55:59] hope when there is no hope God is always
[56:02] looking for that one who will stand up
[56:04] in the face of opposition and that they
[56:07] will be a real believer he'll be a real
[56:10] have a real man of Faith a real genuine
[56:12] Faith no matter what the situation is
[56:15] that Jesus would say that when the son
[56:17] of man comes in the last days will he
[56:19] find Faith so it shows us that we're
[56:21] living in an hour when men do not
[56:23] believe in the word of God anymore but I
[56:25] want to signal to all of Heaven There is
[56:27] some Believers down here at Full Gospel
[56:29] Lighthouse that truly believe all the
[56:31] word of God and I believe that that that
[56:34] was the kind of man that God had found
[56:37] in Joshua that he was a man that was
[56:39] going to fulfill prophecy that he was
[56:42] going to align hisself or match hisself
[56:45] match his testimony with what the angel
[56:48] was saying and I believe that that God
[56:50] had found somebody that he could hook
[56:52] his word in brother Chris that really
[56:54] believed him let me say it like this I
[56:58] believe that that the Lord allowed
[57:00] Joshua to be close to him was because he
[57:03] knew that Joshua wasn't going to walk
[57:05] away from him when things got hard and
[57:07] when things got tough Joshua was allowed
[57:10] to be close because he wasn't going to
[57:12] walk away with all of them old dead
[57:14] Fighters that that had left the had left
[57:16] the Mana that had left the things and
[57:18] wanted to go back to Egypt Joshua was
[57:21] allowed to get close to Jesus because he
[57:24] was elected to be close to him
[57:27] Hallelujah and Joshua had a desire upon
[57:30] his life to stay right there right there
[57:33] in the presence of God to stay right
[57:35] there God knew something about Joshua
[57:38] that maybe maybe maybe today that maybe
[57:41] you don't fully understand who you are
[57:43] but God knows who you are and maybe
[57:46] you've been called to a position and
[57:48] maybe you don't understand how you're
[57:50] going to get in that position or how
[57:52] that you can stand in that position but
[57:54] God has deposited something on the
[57:56] inside of you he knew that Joshua would
[57:59] not run from the freight he knew he
[58:01] wouldn't run from the battle but
[58:02] literally he would turn his eyes towards
[58:05] the battle and that's what God is
[58:07] looking for somebody that's not afraid
[58:09] of the battle but somebody that is
[58:11] certain of God somebody that knows who
[58:14] they
[58:15] are Hallelujah now in question and
[58:18] answers he said which is it he said an
[58:20] angel's a servant he said but we are
[58:22] Sons and Daughters he said which is the
[58:25] most thought of your servant or your son
[58:28] or daughter he said Oh my he said prayer
[58:30] from a saint will go a million times
[58:32] higher than an angel yes sir because
[58:35] he's a son W woo he said that's right my
[58:38] brother my sister you don't the church
[58:41] he said I don't believe that this side
[58:43] of Eternity how will ever realize how
[58:46] that what you are and the position that
[58:48] you are that God has placed you
[58:50] Spirit-filled people that you're sons of
[58:53] God why angels are servants but you're
[58:56] the son an angel can only bring a
[58:59] message but you have to act amen you're
[59:02] the actor on the scene you're the son
[59:05] the angels are servants to bring you to
[59:07] the message said I brought you to this
[59:09] message for you to do such and such this
[59:12] is from the father I bring it to you
[59:14] that's all that it is amen you're Sons
[59:17] and Daughters of God now look at this
[59:20] Jericho was before Joshua and the angel
[59:24] was standing there but when the the
[59:26] angel shows up it signal to Joshua that
[59:29] the victory was
[59:32] assured now Joshua is one of the or
[59:34] Jericho is one of the oldest inhabited
[59:37] cities in all the Earth that Jericho had
[59:41] had been had had been inhabited you can
[59:43] go back and study out the history and
[59:46] find out the potteries and different
[59:47] things that they laid back there in the
[59:49] bronze ages and all the different things
[59:51] and they found out that Jericho is one
[59:54] of the oldest people pieces of land or
[59:57] real estate that there ever is in all of
[1:00:00] humanity that was inhabited but it was
[1:00:03] going to be the very first piece of real
[1:00:05] estate that Joshua was going to go and
[1:00:08] possess he wasn't going to have to buy
[1:00:10] it he was already give to him but Joshua
[1:00:14] had to go and make a claim upon
[1:00:16] it you see Joshua done seen the
[1:00:19] supernatural he does seen the
[1:00:21] supernatural in his ministry he doesn't
[1:00:22] seen Visions he's done cross the river
[1:00:25] of Jordan he done sent spies over the
[1:00:27] Jordan he done send a family over there
[1:00:30] apply the token he done sent some take
[1:00:32] boys in there preaching a message and
[1:00:35] they went in there and they got a lady I
[1:00:38] know I've been leaving you there for a
[1:00:39] little bit Rahab but today's your day
[1:00:42] today's your day Rahab I know you've
[1:00:45] been sealed up in there since Joshua
[1:00:47] chapter 2 but I want you to know that
[1:00:50] your
[1:00:51] deliverance is in the
[1:00:53] room now notice he said one day while
[1:00:57] Josh was out there he he was studying a
[1:00:59] strategy for the attack upon Jericho he
[1:01:02] said and one day while he was walking
[1:01:04] out there or one morning looking out
[1:01:06] towards the gates all over how great it
[1:01:09] was they could run the chariot races on
[1:01:11] top of it in some places it is said that
[1:01:15] they could run three to five chariots
[1:01:18] around the top of them walls they were
[1:01:21] that
[1:01:22] thick and Joshua was out there looking
[1:01:25] about a strategy
[1:01:26] and Joshua was looking out there he
[1:01:28] looked and standing over there against
[1:01:30] the wall and there stood a man had his
[1:01:33] sword drawn Joshua drew his sword I went
[1:01:35] to meet him and Joshua screamed are you
[1:01:37] for us or are you for your enemies he
[1:01:40] said but no I'm am the captain of the
[1:01:44] host of the Lord he was signaling to
[1:01:46] Joshua you're on my
[1:01:49] side you're on my side I want you to
[1:01:53] know that that angel is in this room and
[1:01:55] he is is signaling to you today that
[1:01:58] you're on his side you're on his side
[1:02:01] and if you're on God's side you are
[1:02:04] assured the
[1:02:06] victory I love I love what the prophet
[1:02:09] does here and the great warrior Joshua
[1:02:12] notice notice how that the prophet
[1:02:15] identifies the mighty one that Joshua is
[1:02:18] standing there he calls him the leader
[1:02:21] of Israel that he's none other than
[1:02:24] Jesus Christ
[1:02:26] that he's the Unseen Captain he's the
[1:02:29] same one that was there in the pillar of
[1:02:31] fire he is known as the angel of the
[1:02:33] Lord he is the omnipotent one he is the
[1:02:37] invisible one and he is the same one
[1:02:41] that Abraham met in the one
[1:02:44] MDC notice what the prophet is doing he
[1:02:48] is saying and signaling to this
[1:02:51] generation that the one that has stood
[1:02:53] up is none other than than our Jesus
[1:02:56] Christ now the angel that stood at the
[1:02:59] pulpit with William brandom was not the
[1:03:01] mighty
[1:03:02] Angel it was an angel from the presence
[1:03:06] of the Lord but if you read Revelations
[1:03:08] chapter 10 it is Christ The Mighty angel
[1:03:13] now notice that one that is standing
[1:03:15] there brother brother random would take
[1:03:17] some time in this and he would lay some
[1:03:19] things in and I don't want to spend much
[1:03:20] time here but he would tell us he said
[1:03:22] now that one that appears to me he said
[1:03:24] now that's not Jesus he said because
[1:03:26] this man this Angel is a very tall man a
[1:03:29] big man about 6ot dark hair all of
[1:03:32] complexion Got Deep set eyes he said but
[1:03:35] Jesus is a real short
[1:03:37] man now I'm I'm going to leave it right
[1:03:39] there but when Jesus Hallelujah but when
[1:03:42] Joshua is standing there he looks out
[1:03:46] there and what does he see he sees the
[1:03:49] captain or the mighty Angel himself
[1:03:52] standing there with a sword in his hand
[1:03:55] I want you to notice this that when the
[1:03:57] angel is standing there with a sword in
[1:04:00] his hand he's already got it un sheathed
[1:04:03] it's already ready it's ready for battle
[1:04:06] now notice when Joshua is standing there
[1:04:09] he when Joshua is standing there when he
[1:04:11] begins to signal to him who he was and
[1:04:14] who Christ was what does he do he simply
[1:04:18] puts Joshua and he positionally places
[1:04:21] him as Jehovah savior as Joshua the one
[1:04:25] that was going to bring Deliverance to
[1:04:27] all of
[1:04:30] Israel what was he doing he was standing
[1:04:32] there this is an attachment that this is
[1:04:35] not this is not just a angel that is
[1:04:37] standing here this is not just one of
[1:04:39] the boys that is standing there this is
[1:04:41] Jesus this is
[1:04:43] MDC this is hallelujah I know that I
[1:04:47] know that sometimes people hear the
[1:04:49] angels near and they misconstrue it but
[1:04:52] it is this this Mighty angel that you
[1:04:54] see in Revelation 10 notice how he
[1:04:57] signals himself by his name he's not a
[1:05:00] weak Angel he's a strong Angel he's not
[1:05:04] a loose Angel he's a mighty Angel and he
[1:05:07] knows what to do with the word of God
[1:05:10] and notice when William brandham is
[1:05:12] standing up there at Pulpit Rock he's
[1:05:15] standing there and all of a sudden he
[1:05:17] said there's a good place to pray right
[1:05:19] here and he started praying and when he
[1:05:21] stood up what was in his hand none other
[1:05:25] than the King sword the same sword that
[1:05:28] Joshua looked on that angel and he saw
[1:05:31] that sword which is the word of
[1:05:34] God ah Hallelujah this ain't some
[1:05:37] special sword that was just given in
[1:05:39] this generation but it was this age that
[1:05:42] it was UN sheathed it had been locked up
[1:05:45] it had been sheath for so many thousands
[1:05:47] of years but in this
[1:05:50] age in this age our Joshua our leader
[1:05:54] unath
[1:05:56] the
[1:06:00] sword as Charlie Torres would say it's
[1:06:03] time to sink the
[1:06:05] sword
[1:06:07] Hallelujah some of you is here and you
[1:06:09] know what I was talking about some of
[1:06:11] you won't brother Adam will tell you
[1:06:13] about
[1:06:13] it I got to reading this book I got to
[1:06:16] reading a book this
[1:06:18] week about about a battle that took
[1:06:20] place in the
[1:06:22] 1500s and it's called the rise of the
[1:06:25] Dutch Republic and the and it describes
[1:06:28] these battles that was taking place in
[1:06:30] the 1500s between Holland and the
[1:06:32] European cities there and Spain and and
[1:06:36] and the word that the that the author
[1:06:38] wrote it said that with with God on our
[1:06:41] side that we are in the majority I find
[1:06:45] that amazing that William Brandon would
[1:06:47] would say the same exact thing to us is
[1:06:49] that when you and God are together that
[1:06:52] you are a majority now notice notice
[1:06:56] what in the book here it said that there
[1:06:58] that there was a letter that was in
[1:06:59] there during these times of war from the
[1:07:02] a from the prince of orange that Howell
[1:07:04] that he had raised up and men were
[1:07:07] asking him about how he was going to do
[1:07:09] the battle and he said that you've asked
[1:07:11] me if I have entered into a firm treaty
[1:07:14] with any great king or potentate to
[1:07:16] which I answer that before I ever took
[1:07:19] up this cross before I ever took up this
[1:07:21] cause and to and of these oppressed
[1:07:24] Christians in these providences he said
[1:07:27] I have entered in to a close alliance
[1:07:30] with the king of kings and I am firmly
[1:07:32] convinced that all who put their trust
[1:07:35] in him shall be saved by the almighty
[1:07:38] hand that the god of armies will raise
[1:07:41] up armies for us to do battle with our
[1:07:44] enemies and his own that go Hallelujah
[1:07:48] if an Earthly King an Earthly Prince
[1:07:50] could literally write these words that
[1:07:53] you ask me have I come in close
[1:07:56] relationship with any of these other
[1:07:58] colonies and any of these other
[1:08:00] countries out there but I'll say this I
[1:08:02] have come in contact with not just a
[1:08:05] king but the King of Kings notice he did
[1:08:08] not say that just was a king sword but
[1:08:11] he said this was the king sword so
[1:08:14] you're not just fighting with the king
[1:08:16] of Egypt you're not fighting with just
[1:08:18] the king of England you're not just
[1:08:20] fighting with a king of Spain sword
[1:08:22] you're fighting with the domain of
[1:08:24] Heaven
[1:08:26] now William bandham would tell us in the
[1:08:27] message that they that God the greatest
[1:08:30] gift that he ever gave to humanity he
[1:08:32] said the most powerful weapon on the
[1:08:34] face of the Earth he would tell us it's
[1:08:36] prayer he would tell us it's love and he
[1:08:39] would tell us that it's the word of God
[1:08:42] so if we're going to go to battle we've
[1:08:44] got to have love we've got to have a
[1:08:46] prayer life and we've got to have the
[1:08:48] word of
[1:08:50] God hallelujah hallelujah the Lord knows
[1:08:55] how to to appear to you in your
[1:08:56] situations of
[1:08:58] Life some of you are in need of
[1:09:00] Deliverance today and I want you to know
[1:09:03] I want to signal to you that the
[1:09:05] deliverer is in the room some of you are
[1:09:09] in need of healing and I want to signal
[1:09:11] to you that the healer is in the room
[1:09:14] today some of you are in need of peace
[1:09:16] in your marriage and I want to signal to
[1:09:19] you that the king of peace is in the
[1:09:22] room I know what I'm talking about
[1:09:25] because he knows how to make himself
[1:09:27] known to you in the attributes that you
[1:09:30] need him at the
[1:09:32] moment what did he do when he showed up
[1:09:34] to Abraham he showed himself as MDC the
[1:09:39] king of righteousness and the king of
[1:09:41] Peace because Abraham needed a peace in
[1:09:45] his body that would bring forth and
[1:09:48] manifest an 18year old man that could
[1:09:51] produce an Isaac so he showed himself as
[1:09:55] MDC the king of righteousness when he
[1:09:59] showed up to Jacob he showed up to Jacob
[1:10:01] and the prophet was distressed of the
[1:10:04] conflict that he was having with his
[1:10:06] brother so what did he show up to Jacob
[1:10:08] as he showed up as a
[1:10:12] wrestler so God knows how to show up to
[1:10:15] your wrestling match he
[1:10:19] knows I'm right on point I'm right on
[1:10:22] point he knows where to show up at he
[1:10:24] knows how to S signal to your situation
[1:10:26] that I am that I am come on somebody and
[1:10:30] when he showed up to Joshua he didn't
[1:10:33] show up there with a pacifier in his
[1:10:35] hand he didn't show up there with a
[1:10:37] bottle in his hand he didn't show up
[1:10:39] there he showed up as a
[1:10:45] warrior he showed up as a warrior
[1:10:48] because Joshua was in
[1:10:51] war church we in war
[1:10:56] if you ain't figured this out by now
[1:10:58] hell is against this church and we are
[1:11:01] in the midst of battle but God did not
[1:11:05] show up
[1:11:07] here as some weak God he showed up here
[1:11:11] as a mighty God in pattle he said you
[1:11:14] watched him as a Healer but get ready to
[1:11:16] watch him as a
[1:11:18] warrior Full Gospel Lighthouse I want to
[1:11:21] Signal this to you and the body of Jesus
[1:11:24] Christ our Lord Jesus Christ is taking
[1:11:27] the case of the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:11:30] and we won't lose and we won't back
[1:11:33] down how do you know that brother Andrew
[1:11:35] because when the angel shows up your
[1:11:38] Victory is
[1:11:42] assured how can I say your prodical are
[1:11:45] coming because God said so how can I say
[1:11:48] your healings in the room because God
[1:11:50] said
[1:11:54] so
[1:11:59] Hallelujah so our Lord knows
[1:12:01] how to show
[1:12:04] sympathy and to show up to any condition
[1:12:06] of
[1:12:08] Life remember when the prophet is there
[1:12:10] in his room and that evil spirit is
[1:12:13] tormenting him and remember when brother
[1:12:17] Adam said these words he said Satan
[1:12:18] you're an offense to me
[1:12:21] leave the brother mam said then the
[1:12:23] sweetest presence come in the
[1:12:26] room and he
[1:12:28] said never fear to go anywhere or do
[1:12:32] anything for the never failing presence
[1:12:34] of Jesus Christ is with you
[1:12:37] wherever you go wherever you go I think
[1:12:42] it's very powerful because it shows if
[1:12:45] you cannot fear it shows you've got a
[1:12:48] great weapon on your side You've Got
[1:12:50] Love on your
[1:12:51] side don't you fear to go anywhere or do
[1:12:54] anything for the ever failing presence
[1:12:56] of Jesus Christ is with you now William
[1:12:58] brand said now God is always present he
[1:13:00] said if we can only remember that that
[1:13:02] the angel of the Lord encamped about
[1:13:05] those who fear Him He said in this
[1:13:07] building tonight stands Jesus Christ in
[1:13:09] this building tonight is a host of
[1:13:11] angels thousands of them gathered around
[1:13:14] Hallelujah I can feel them in the room
[1:13:16] you don't see them but you can feel the
[1:13:18] influence of them telling you that they
[1:13:20] are here if that isn't so then the
[1:13:23] scriptures isn't so if if the scripture
[1:13:25] isn't right then God isn't right the
[1:13:28] Bible said the angels of God are
[1:13:30] encamped about them that fear the lord
[1:13:32] they don't leave you they stay near
[1:13:35] those that fear Him Jesus said wherever
[1:13:38] two or three are gathered in my name
[1:13:40] there I will be in the midst of them
[1:13:42] then that makes him in a world that we
[1:13:44] cannot see that our five senses does not
[1:13:47] contact Jesus Christ is here he's
[1:13:50] present if he if we could be only
[1:13:53] conscious of that
[1:13:56] what is an angel It's a messenger that
[1:13:59] God has a messenger in this room and
[1:14:03] that messenger is the word of God it is
[1:14:05] the Holy
[1:14:08] Ghost I pray that the Lord God today
[1:14:10] would do for you like he did for Gesa
[1:14:13] when Elisha stood there and he prayed
[1:14:15] over him when Gesa was fearing when Gesa
[1:14:18] was nervous when Gesa looked out there
[1:14:21] and seen the host of the armies of the
[1:14:24] armies of the Syrian Elijah said these
[1:14:27] words Lord open his eyes that he might
[1:14:30] see that there's more with us than there
[1:14:33] is with them because the prophet knew
[1:14:36] that Psalms 91 said I will give my
[1:14:39] angels to take charge over
[1:14:42] [Applause]
[1:14:44] you we neither in the
[1:14:47] room
[1:14:49] Hallelujah them Angels ain't leaving you
[1:14:52] I know his little children they know
[1:14:53] that song Angels watching over over
[1:14:56] me maybe they don't know that song but
[1:14:58] if y'all need to hear it me and Gabriel
[1:15:00] can sing it we sang it when we was 5
[1:15:01] years old I was probably I was probably
[1:15:03] nine he was probably five we can sing it
[1:15:05] for you we look like a bunch of kids up
[1:15:08] here probably need tiny to play the
[1:15:11] cords CU I don't know them but there's
[1:15:13] angels that are lit they're literally
[1:15:15] watching over
[1:15:16] you that's why William Brandon would
[1:15:18] stand there and he would tell us now you
[1:15:20] see that picture he said it he said it
[1:15:22] influences he said you ought to have
[1:15:24] that picture of that angel watching over
[1:15:26] those children going across that bridge
[1:15:28] you know what I'm talking about got that
[1:15:31] got that board that's missing and
[1:15:32] there's an Angel that's watching over it
[1:15:34] he said you ought to have it in there
[1:15:36] because it's an influence upon that
[1:15:38] little child what is it doing it's
[1:15:40] signaling to their subconscious that
[1:15:43] there's an angel that is here that's why
[1:15:45] David would say I have heard Thy word in
[1:15:49] my heart that I might not sin against
[1:15:51] you he always constantly he wrote it up
[1:15:54] on his bed post he wrote the word of God
[1:15:56] wherever he was because he wanted to be
[1:15:59] conscious he wanted to be conscious that
[1:16:01] he was always before the Lord now angels
[1:16:05] are throughout all the Bible Angels
[1:16:07] appeared to Gideon and they placed him
[1:16:10] as a mighty man of Valor when Gideon
[1:16:13] didn't even know that he was a mighty
[1:16:14] man of Valor what was it it was
[1:16:16] signaling to all of Israel that he was a
[1:16:19] god of Deliverance and that it was proof
[1:16:22] that he was God going to be God Our
[1:16:25] Savior notice notice in demonology if
[1:16:29] you ain't listened to it for a while go
[1:16:31] back and listen to it he said now up
[1:16:33] here now notice this is what I want to
[1:16:35] get to you you watch the very power of
[1:16:37] the realm that you're fellowshipping
[1:16:41] with all right watch the realm that
[1:16:44] you're fellowshipping with if you're
[1:16:45] feeding on things of carnality that's
[1:16:47] the realm that you're fellowshipping
[1:16:49] with if you're feeding on the word of
[1:16:51] God it shows what you're in fellowship
[1:16:54] with he said now up here he said
[1:16:56] Christians are influenced from above he
[1:16:58] said this is a parable he said up here
[1:17:00] is another ghost the Holy Ghost the
[1:17:02] ghost of a man Christ Jesus he said the
[1:17:05] Holy Ghost influences his church in the
[1:17:08] realm of mortal so it shows us that our
[1:17:12] Lord Jesus Christ can influence the very
[1:17:14] life matters that we are
[1:17:17] in is that right he controls the winds
[1:17:20] and he controls the Wass is that right
[1:17:24] so the holy goes influences CH his
[1:17:26] church in this realm of mortal he said
[1:17:29] the Devil by these Spirits influen men
[1:17:32] now look the next is Angel the next is
[1:17:34] God and now every Mortal here is
[1:17:38] influenced by one of these worlds so we
[1:17:42] don't see it with our eyes here though
[1:17:45] some of us have been granted to be able
[1:17:46] to look in there and see the pillar of
[1:17:48] fire or see a supernatural Haze go over
[1:17:51] the congregation but it's got to go
[1:17:54] beyond
[1:17:55] these five senses it's got to we've got
[1:17:58] to go into a realm where the
[1:18:00] supernatural God can take us into a
[1:18:02] supernatural world and produce
[1:18:05] Supernatural Miracles because if we are
[1:18:08] ever going to be the people of God and
[1:18:10] know that he's God then we've got to
[1:18:12] know him in the power of his
[1:18:14] resurrection and we will do exploits
[1:18:17] when we know
[1:18:19] him when you start looking at that
[1:18:21] Unseen World and you start looking into
[1:18:24] it by faith
[1:18:25] what is going to take place William
[1:18:26] brandham said that when two omnipotents
[1:18:28] meet that the omnipotence is going to
[1:18:31] that the miraculous is going to take
[1:18:33] place it is an angel it is the Angel of
[1:18:36] the lord it's the angel of the Covenant
[1:18:39] it's the pillar of fire it's MDC that he
[1:18:42] said in Exodus 23 and 20 that I will
[1:18:44] send my angel before thee to keep thee
[1:18:47] in the way and to bring thee into the
[1:18:49] place which I have
[1:18:51] prepared beware of him and obey
[1:18:55] his voice provoke him not for he will
[1:18:58] not pardon your transgressions for my
[1:19:00] name is in him so what is it it was the
[1:19:03] same one that was leading the children
[1:19:05] of Israel that that stood there in
[1:19:08] Exodus chapter 14 that showed up as a
[1:19:10] pillar of
[1:19:11] fire and he opened up the Red
[1:19:14] Sea then he opened up the Red Sea
[1:19:17] brother brandham said that one writer
[1:19:19] wrote it this way that God got so mad at
[1:19:21] the devil that God looked down through
[1:19:23] there through the pillar fire with Angry
[1:19:26] Eyes and he opened up the Red
[1:19:29] Sea I tell you how God how Mad God got
[1:19:32] it his enemy that God opened up the Red
[1:19:35] Sea five miles wide don't tell me God
[1:19:38] don't know how to make a way for your
[1:19:40] business to
[1:19:41] prosper come on somebody if he's a way
[1:19:44] maker and he can open the Red Sea five
[1:19:47] miles surely he can prosper your
[1:19:50] business surely he can give you health
[1:19:53] surely he can give you wealth surely he
[1:19:55] can prosper you surely he can deliver
[1:19:59] you it's that same Pillar of Fire that
[1:20:01] led them by night and would stand there
[1:20:03] and be a cloud to them by the day now
[1:20:06] let me say this to you that the one that
[1:20:08] goes to you that goes with you in battle
[1:20:11] it
[1:20:12] matters I'll just be dead serious with
[1:20:14] you I don't really count on President
[1:20:16] Trump or president Bren or President
[1:20:18] Obama and any of these presidents that
[1:20:20] are down throughout our history to go
[1:20:22] into battle they won't matter too much
[1:20:24] to me in my battle because I'm not
[1:20:26] fighting them kind of battles but I am
[1:20:28] fighting a spiritual
[1:20:32] battle Lord have mercy don't lock up on
[1:20:35] me if you're trusted in that kind of man
[1:20:37] you need to come to the altar because
[1:20:39] that won't get you out of the battle
[1:20:40] that you're in there ain't no salvation
[1:20:42] in
[1:20:48] Trump come on somebody you're fighting a
[1:20:51] bigger battle than Biden can figure out
[1:20:53] you're fighting a bigger batt that n
[1:20:55] Yahoo can figure out you're fighting a
[1:20:57] battle against spiritual wickedness in
[1:21:00] high places but there is a
[1:21:02] God he's the god of armies that controls
[1:21:06] the wind that controls the waves it
[1:21:09] matters who goes in the battle to
[1:21:12] you if you got one walking in with you
[1:21:14] brother Jordan that's liking to the son
[1:21:16] of man you going to step out of the fire
[1:21:18] and not even smell burnt if you walk
[1:21:20] into a valley and there's a Goliath
[1:21:22] that's down there calling your name
[1:21:24] you're going to come out of winter when
[1:21:26] you walk into a valley then when you
[1:21:28] walk into a pit that's full of lion Den
[1:21:30] there's one in there with you that the
[1:21:33] pillar of fire has showed up that them
[1:21:35] lines can't eat
[1:21:37] you I tell you the God I'm talking about
[1:21:40] is a God that knows how to walk on
[1:21:42] water it doesn't matter the battle that
[1:21:45] you're in it doesn't matter the
[1:21:46] situation that you're in are you hear me
[1:21:49] today the god that I'm talking about
[1:21:51] will walk on Waters just to come to you
[1:21:54] he'll make a highway out of
[1:21:58] waters let me tell you something when
[1:22:00] Jesus was asleep in the boat the winds
[1:22:03] didn't wake him up the waves didn't wake
[1:22:05] him up but woke woke what what woke him
[1:22:08] up was the sound of his children's
[1:22:11] voices calling his
[1:22:17] name ah come on now come on I'm in the
[1:22:21] battle I'm in the frea but don't you
[1:22:23] give up don't you give
[1:22:26] in the winds ain't going to wake him up
[1:22:29] the waves ain't going to wake him up but
[1:22:31] if you call on his name in the midst of
[1:22:33] your battle come hell or come high water
[1:22:36] let floods come let Fire come let lions
[1:22:39] come let Giants come let torment come
[1:22:43] blessed be the name of the Lord Our God
[1:22:46] will raise up a mighty
[1:22:49] [Applause]
[1:22:53] warrior
[1:22:59] what are you saying brother
[1:23:02] Andrew when he's
[1:23:05] there when he's in the room when he's
[1:23:09] present when you can feel
[1:23:13] him Hallelujah when you can feel him in
[1:23:15] the
[1:23:16] room when you can touch him we can
[1:23:19] handle him I ain't talking about some
[1:23:21] emotion I ain't talking about some
[1:23:22] psychology I ain't talking about some
[1:23:24] chill running down your back and running
[1:23:26] down over your neck I believe that can
[1:23:28] come to you too I believe that he can
[1:23:30] manifest himself and he'll sweep over
[1:23:32] this congregation and pour out his
[1:23:34] Spirit but I'm talking about when you
[1:23:36] feel him in the room not by your
[1:23:38] emotions not by your feelings but by the
[1:23:41] word of God you said you know that he
[1:23:44] said that I'll never leave you and I'll
[1:23:45] never forsake you and when you know that
[1:23:47] he's in the room and when you know he
[1:23:49] came for your case when he know that he
[1:23:51] ain't gave up on
[1:23:53] you what am am I saying to you your
[1:23:55] Victory is
[1:24:03] assured Joshua was a man who knew about
[1:24:06] the cement he knew he built these walls
[1:24:09] before he knew it was going to take a
[1:24:11] supernatural element to
[1:24:16] conquer but he showed
[1:24:19] up because of who you
[1:24:23] are
[1:24:27] why' he come in
[1:24:28] 1950 and have his picture taken over our
[1:24:31] prophet he showed up because of who you
[1:24:35] are come on somebody look out there look
[1:24:39] out there on Mount Sunset look out
[1:24:44] there look out there what is that out
[1:24:47] there don't look and try to see the
[1:24:48] angels in the cloud see the one that
[1:24:51] showed up it's him
[1:24:57] Hallelujah he has Vis he has visited
[1:24:59] this generation he's appeared to this
[1:25:01] generation but he did not appear to you
[1:25:04] to leave you in Creeds to leave you in
[1:25:06] dogmas to leave you in change to leave
[1:25:09] you in man Hallelujah he showed up here
[1:25:12] as the mighty Angel the angel of the
[1:25:15] Covenant and when he showed up here he
[1:25:18] didn't show up here sister Phyllis with
[1:25:20] a clo
[1:25:21] book The Lion of the tribe of Judah hath
[1:25:25] prevailed to loose the Seven Seals
[1:25:29] thereof Hallelujah what's he got in his
[1:25:33] hand what's he got in his hand he's got
[1:25:35] your name and the reason why he showed
[1:25:37] up here is because you mean something to
[1:25:42] him Hallelujah when Jericho when Jericho
[1:25:46] was over there can you
[1:25:48] imagine oh I hope you hear me today I'm
[1:25:52] enjoying
[1:25:53] myself
[1:25:54] but when everybody else can you imagine
[1:25:56] all the city it is said that anywhere
[1:25:58] between 2,000 and 7,000 people are on
[1:26:00] the inside of Jericho that's a big
[1:26:02] number but they're all dead so they
[1:26:03] can't tell the testimony
[1:26:08] so how'd you hear the story always love
[1:26:12] that we got a Bible that tells us a
[1:26:15] story but anywhere between 2000 and
[1:26:18] 7,000 people are there in Jericho all
[1:26:20] shut up why because of you
[1:26:25] amen you know how powerful that you
[1:26:29] are let me remind you how powerful you
[1:26:31] are that if Satan touches you if he
[1:26:35] touches your womb and tries to take your
[1:26:37] virginity away from you that God will
[1:26:40] literally shut up the kings of Egypt's
[1:26:43] towns that they will completely become
[1:26:46] desolate that's how powerful that you
[1:26:49] are I'll tell you how powerful you are
[1:26:52] is that when you pray God God will send
[1:26:54] an Angel by your way and if you're still
[1:26:58] right in line with the message God has
[1:27:00] got angels to show up at your Juniper
[1:27:03] Tri El to minister to you to touch you
[1:27:07] to fellowship with you he's got Angels
[1:27:10] at every hand he's got angels that can
[1:27:12] March over you and one person can pray
[1:27:15] and
[1:27:15] 185,000 Assyrians are destroyed by one
[1:27:20] Angel what are you talking about brother
[1:27:22] Angel I'm talking about you are living
[1:27:24] in an hour you're living in an hour that
[1:27:27] he's here he's here he's here now his
[1:27:32] Corporal body is coming for you one of
[1:27:34] these days but his physical presence of
[1:27:36] Jesus Christ the anointed one is in the
[1:27:39] room and he's looking for myates that
[1:27:41] will literally take him at his word and
[1:27:44] destroy the Yoke of the
[1:27:47] enemy I can point you back to where he
[1:27:49] was with Abraham I can point you back to
[1:27:52] the land I studied the lands out I've
[1:27:54] looked over it I can point to you where
[1:27:55] Abraham was I can tell you where he met
[1:27:58] mzc at I can look at the Battle of
[1:28:01] Jericho and I can point it to you on a
[1:28:03] map where they say that Joshua was
[1:28:06] looking at Jericho but I don't want to
[1:28:08] just be where he was at I want to be
[1:28:11] where he is
[1:28:14] now stop wishing you was back in William
[1:28:17] brenham's day you don't need to be where
[1:28:19] he was at be where he is
[1:28:23] now right now in the presence of the
[1:28:26] Living God the same God that would stand
[1:28:29] there with Georgie Carter and raise her
[1:28:31] up and would stand there and tell people
[1:28:34] what their address was is the same God
[1:28:37] that is in the
[1:28:41] room how bad do you want to get loose
[1:28:44] Rahab how bad do you want to get out of
[1:28:47] your prison house how bad how bad have
[1:28:50] you spent your time standing there in
[1:28:52] prayer asking for your dad to get in
[1:28:55] asking for your mama to get in how many
[1:28:57] it ain't in vain
[1:29:00] Rahab he's in the room and he's showing
[1:29:03] up to bring Deliverance to your
[1:29:08] house what is it what does he do to us
[1:29:12] give me Revelations 10:8
[1:29:17] please and the voice which I heard from
[1:29:19] Heaven spake unto me again and said go
[1:29:23] and take the book
[1:29:24] take the little book which is open in
[1:29:27] the hand of the Angel which standeth
[1:29:28] upon the sea and upon the
[1:29:32] Earth and I went unto the
[1:29:36] angel what are you doing with this
[1:29:40] message and I went unto the angel and I
[1:29:43] said unto him give me the little book
[1:29:46] and he said unto me take it and eat it
[1:29:48] up and it shall make thy belly bitter
[1:29:50] but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as
[1:29:52] honey and I took the little book come on
[1:29:55] John I took the little book out of the
[1:29:57] Angel's hand and I ate it up I ate it up
[1:30:01] I didn't let it sit there stagnant I
[1:30:03] didn't let it just stay on the real to
[1:30:05] re I didn't let it just stay on the
[1:30:06] tapes but I ate it up I became the book
[1:30:10] I became a physical living image of
[1:30:12] Jesus
[1:30:13] Christ I ate it up and it was in my
[1:30:17] mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I
[1:30:21] had eaten it my belly was bitter
[1:30:24] what am I saying to you that when you
[1:30:26] eat this
[1:30:28] word it brings merror to your bone but
[1:30:31] it causes a war on the inside of
[1:30:34] you but he gives you some instruction
[1:30:38] this ain't just William Brandon that's
[1:30:39] giv you instruction this is the mighty
[1:30:41] Angel this is Christ himself saying and
[1:30:44] he said unto me John thou must prophesy
[1:30:48] again before many peoples and Nations
[1:30:51] and tongues and kings
[1:30:55] what are you going to do brother Andrew
[1:30:58] I'm going to say what the message
[1:31:01] said what am I saying to you that your
[1:31:04] time of silence is
[1:31:12] over Saturday was
[1:31:14] silent but Sunday there was proof there
[1:31:16] was an empty
[1:31:18] tomb it's a new day it's a dawning of a
[1:31:21] new day the son of man is up up the Son
[1:31:24] of God is here what is it the time of
[1:31:27] silence is over and it's time to release
[1:31:31] everything that the prophet has given to
[1:31:33] this generation what did William
[1:31:35] brandham say that you would be a final
[1:31:37] voice to the final age that you have got
[1:31:40] to prophesy you've got to take your
[1:31:42] position as a son and daughter of God if
[1:31:45] the Thunders have shouted out their
[1:31:47] voices and he woke up the sleeping bride
[1:31:50] The bridegroom's
[1:31:52] Voice
[1:31:54] what is it it has awakened you to
[1:31:56] realize who you are as a Son of God
[1:31:59] you're not just a
[1:32:01] churchgoer I know I might be talking to
[1:32:03] churchgoers but I'm talk I know that
[1:32:05] they might be hearing me but I'm not
[1:32:07] preaching a message to just churchgoers
[1:32:10] I'm not just preaching a message to
[1:32:12] Spectators I am preaching a message to a
[1:32:15] virgin born
[1:32:21] bride the Bible said in 1 Corinth
[1:32:24] 14 and8 for if the trumpet give an
[1:32:27] uncertain sound who shall prepare
[1:32:30] himself to the battle there ain't
[1:32:33] nothing uncertain about this message
[1:32:35] because it's not our words and it's not
[1:32:37] a man's words it's the Angels words
[1:32:40] William brandham said in the uncertain
[1:32:42] sound he said soldiers in the days of
[1:32:44] their training they are trained to those
[1:32:46] bugles how them sounds to retreat and
[1:32:49] and what they are to do and everything
[1:32:51] they're trained by a sound that if they
[1:32:54] don't know if they didn't know that
[1:32:56] sound how in the world would they know
[1:32:58] how to prepare themselves that's right
[1:33:00] but they've been train to that sound and
[1:33:03] they know when that sound goes off it
[1:33:06] means a certain
[1:33:08] thing I'm not
[1:33:11] trained I'm not trained to their
[1:33:15] message I'm not trained to the Catholic
[1:33:18] message the Catholic sound doesn't
[1:33:21] signal anything to
[1:33:22] me come on somebody when the pope gets
[1:33:25] out and sends up a smoke signal that
[1:33:27] they're asking for a new pope I don't
[1:33:29] send any signal to me but when I hear
[1:33:33] the voice of this message it signals
[1:33:36] something to me that there is a
[1:33:39] Harmony there is a Harmony between the
[1:33:42] soldiers and the
[1:33:46] sound what is it you're trained to it
[1:33:49] you listen to these things you listen
[1:33:51] from 47 you listen always 65 you know
[1:33:53] these sounds you know what he's talking
[1:33:55] about in deity you know what he's
[1:33:57] talking about the deity of God you know
[1:33:58] what he's talking about the godhead
[1:33:59] explained you know what he's talking
[1:34:01] about why some people can't live a
[1:34:03] Christian Life you know what when he's
[1:34:05] talking about when he says why I'm a
[1:34:08] Holy Roller you know what he's saying to
[1:34:10] you when he preaches marriage and
[1:34:11] divorce you know what he's saying to you
[1:34:13] in invisible Union and things that are
[1:34:16] to be and communion and fellowship and
[1:34:18] love divine the lamb and the dove you
[1:34:21] know what he's saying to you because
[1:34:23] you're train to
[1:34:27] it there a there's a story in a battle I
[1:34:31] I look forward I can't find exactly
[1:34:32] where it is it's a story that they were
[1:34:35] they were in they're in the middle
[1:34:37] middle of a
[1:34:40] war and and and the captain's looking
[1:34:43] out across the war he's looking out
[1:34:45] across it and he sees how that the enemy
[1:34:48] is getting is getting control of it

[1:34:59] Battleground is is is being overcome by
[1:35:01] the enemy and the enem is coming in
[1:35:03] close and the captain and the captain of
[1:35:06] the of the of the army begin to holler
[1:35:09] out to his soldiers he said sound the
[1:35:12] retreat but the man that had the bugle
[1:35:15] had never trained for the sound of
[1:35:18] retreat so we just kept sounding Out the
[1:35:22] sound of charge and he just kept
[1:35:24] sounding Out he said hey sound out the
[1:35:27] retreat and he just kept playing charge
[1:35:30] he said no play the sound of retreat and
[1:35:33] it kept playing charge I said sound off

[1:35:38] charge and the men heard that sound and
[1:35:42] they went out there and they won the
[1:35:44] battle the captain took him to the side
[1:35:47] said son I told you to retreat he said

[1:37:29] Preacher Brother Homer's voice has been

[1:37:39] has a
[1:37:40] Voice come on somebody God ain't looking
[1:37:44] for somebody that's dead in the grave
[1:37:45] for them to sound off he's looking for
[1:37:46] you to sound off come on Moses did his
[1:37:49] part but this ain't Moses's job come on
[1:37:52] somebody this is Joshua's turn this is
[1:37:55] your turn it's time that you turn from
[1:37:58] the old corn and go onto the third pool
[1:38:01] Ministry it's time that you start
[1:38:04] prophesying we don't need squirrels we
[1:38:07] don't need to speak a snowstorm out of
[1:38:08] existence but we do need a rapture we do
[1:38:12] need a body change we do need our loved
[1:38:15] ones we do need healing we do need
[1:38:22] miracles
[1:38:27] now Josh is a
[1:38:30] warrior he's trained for
[1:38:35] this and he's standing there brother bam
[1:38:37] said he's out
[1:38:39] there looking at
[1:38:42] Jericho studying it
[1:38:44] out how am I going to destroy this
[1:38:48] city how am I going to destroy this city
[1:38:51] I've got a lady on in there it's got the
[1:38:52] token how am I going to go in
[1:38:56] there and get her out and destroy all
[1:38:59] the other thousands of people that are
[1:39:00] in that
[1:39:01] City and then upon that
[1:39:05] moment the captain of the host stands
[1:39:10] between him and
[1:39:13] Jericho I love this that the angel
[1:39:16] wasn't looking at Jericho but he was
[1:39:19] looking at the one that held the
[1:39:21] promise the angel wasn't looking at the
[1:39:24] problem the angel was looking at the
[1:39:27] problem solver the angel was looking at
[1:39:31] the one that had a commission on his
[1:39:33] life that every footstep that he took
[1:39:36] was ordered of the
[1:39:39] Lord the angel ain't looking at
[1:39:43] cancer the angel ain't looking at heart
[1:39:46] trouble the angel ain't looking at sugar
[1:39:48] diabetes the angel ain't looking at
[1:39:50] arthritis the angel ain't looking at
[1:39:52] covid the angel ain't looking at the flu
[1:39:55] the angel ain't looking at your little
[1:39:58] puny
[1:40:00] circumstances that's so minuscule to the
[1:40:04] angel the angel is pointing you to the
[1:40:08] solution of your
[1:40:11] condition what are you saying I'm saying
[1:40:14] the angel between you and your problem
[1:40:17] is the
[1:40:21] solution how did Eve get in trouble
[1:40:23] trouble is when she stepped out behind
[1:40:24] the
[1:40:25] solution she stepped out and she took
[1:40:28] her guard down she got out there out
[1:40:30] behind the Fortified word and every
[1:40:32] single time young people when you get
[1:40:35] outside of that fortified word you are
[1:40:38] living a defeated life the moment that
[1:40:41] you step out upon your own condition and
[1:40:44] upon your own thoughts you are living a
[1:40:47] defeated life but if you can keep the
[1:40:50] angel between you and Le oy
[1:40:54] between you and your bank account
[1:40:56] between you and your prodal between you
[1:41:00] and cancer between you and your heart
[1:41:02] problems between you and your
[1:41:05] restrictions between you and your
[1:41:07] Rebellion between you are you getting
[1:41:09] the picture now if you can keep the
[1:41:11] angel of the Covenant between you and
[1:41:14] your situations
[1:41:19] Victory I tell you
[1:41:21] what it's probably a good saying they
[1:41:23] taking that platform down today cuz I
[1:41:25] could probably shout all over top of
[1:41:26] that thing right now if you can ever get
[1:41:28] the angel between you and your problem
[1:41:32] people get ready people get ready what
[1:41:36] am I talking about it's time that you
[1:41:38] prepare yourself a dancing
[1:41:40] party it's time that you prepare
[1:41:42] yourself to have some victory you've
[1:41:45] been living in defeat for too long
[1:41:46] you've been praying over the same
[1:41:48] situations for too long you've been
[1:41:50] asking and got the same prayer list for
[1:41:52] the last 2 years years it's time to
[1:41:54] change your situation from mourning to
[1:41:57] dancing it's time that you change the
[1:42:00] feet into Victory it's time that you
[1:42:03] turn things around and you've got the
[1:42:06] ability
[1:42:11] Joshua Joshua 6 says now Jericho the

[1:52:31] hallelujah
[1:52:33] hallelujah it's worth it brother alonza
[1:52:36] it's worth
[1:52:37] [Applause]
[1:52:46] it it wasn't just shouting just to make
[1:52:51] noise I know a lot of people get get
[1:52:53] confused they just they like it loud in
[1:52:55] that
[1:52:57] place
[1:52:59] well anything and anywhere Jesus is it's
[1:53:02] always got a little noise about
[1:53:04] it but they weren't shouting just to
[1:53:07] make some noise they were shouting to
[1:53:10] match the
[1:53:14] message you hear what I'm talking to
[1:53:17] you you picking up when I'm putting down
[1:53:20] they were shouting because they were
[1:53:22] matching the message what was it Joshua
[1:53:25] had talked face to face to the captain
[1:53:27] of the host of the Lord he told them
[1:53:28] what to do to March around the wall
[1:53:30] sound the trumpet and let out a
[1:53:33] shout remember Joshua who gave you the
[1:53:36] Liberty to shout remember little bride
[1:53:40] who gave you the Liberty to shout I got
[1:53:43] big huge walls in front of me brother
[1:53:44] Andrew I got huge obstacles in front of
[1:53:47] me but the shout that's coming forth
[1:53:49] from your lips is a supernatural
[1:53:53] shout what was it their shout was in
[1:53:57] harmony with the Angel's
[1:54:02] words but I'm afraid that too many
[1:54:05] times people
[1:54:08] enjoy their silent
[1:54:12] time well we done got the seals brother
[1:54:16] Andrew we done got perfect love and
[1:54:18] we've got all these things and you know
[1:54:21] we We Believe in holy
[1:54:25] hushes I tell you what we don't believe
[1:54:27] in getting emotional well let me tell
[1:54:29] you if you felt like we
[1:54:32] [Applause]
[1:54:40] did I believe there's a time to be
[1:54:43] silent I really do believe
[1:54:47] that what's that word
[1:54:50] um against popular
[1:54:53] opinion I do believe in silence because
[1:54:55] Silence has its
[1:55:00] place but too many times people's
[1:55:03] victories are held up by their
[1:55:09] silence too many times they keep their
[1:55:11] children locked up because of their
[1:55:14] silence too many times people keep them
[1:55:17] locked up in their bedrooms doing their
[1:55:19] own things because of their
[1:55:21] silence come
[1:55:23] on too many times people enjoy reading
[1:55:26] Spurgeon more than they read William
[1:55:28] brandom they enjoy their Silence of the
[1:55:30] man age too many times people enjoy
[1:55:33] being silent because they don't know
[1:55:35] what to do and what they're doing
[1:55:36] they're leaving their Victory on the
[1:55:39] outside because of their
[1:55:43] silence now let me tell you you don't
[1:55:44] walk around this thing for so long we
[1:55:48] ain't built here to be a bunch of MSY
[1:55:50] pamsy silent IC
[1:55:53] [Applause]
[1:55:55] Christians let me tell you the angel is
[1:55:58] here the angel is here the lord of the
[1:56:02] Covenant is here and when he shows up
[1:56:05] your Victory is at hand I know this
[1:56:07] don't make any sense to you I know that
[1:56:10] this is a paradox I know that you can't
[1:56:13] understand that if you shout that walls
[1:56:16] are going to come down I know it don't
[1:56:17] make no sense I know sometimes you don't
[1:56:20] understand what I'm talking about when
[1:56:21] the angels and in the room I know that
[1:56:23] sometimes you don't understand what I'm
[1:56:24] talking about that all you've got to do
[1:56:26] is reach out and accept the Lord but I'm
[1:56:29] telling you that on the other side of
[1:56:31] your
[1:56:33] shout is your
[1:56:39] Victory come on somebody come on
[1:56:43] somebody come on somebody what is it the
[1:56:46] shout of the message has woken this
[1:56:51] bride
[1:56:53] that's why he's appearing to you this is
[1:56:55] the rising of the sun verse 15 and it
[1:56:58] came to pass on the seventh day that
[1:57:01] they rose up early about the dawning of
[1:57:04] the
[1:57:05] day and they Compass the city after the
[1:57:09] same manner seven times and it came to
[1:57:14] pass here it is there it is and it came
[1:57:18] to pass at the seventh time when the PRI
[1:57:22] blew with
[1:57:24] trumpets Your Leader Jehovah
[1:57:29] savior said unto you the people that
[1:57:32] matter the people that's been elected to
[1:57:34] get close to where he's at because you
[1:57:37] wouldn't walk away he allowed you to get
[1:57:40] close to him he allowed you to
[1:57:42] fellowship with him he allowed you to
[1:57:44] handle
[1:57:46] him he said unto the people of the open
[1:57:50] book this is
[1:57:53] you
[1:57:55] shout
[1:57:56] shout for the Lord hath given you the
[1:58:05] city I'm signaling something to you
[1:58:07] right here this is more than just me
[1:58:09] going down traditions of following out a
[1:58:11] series the angel of the Lord led me to
[1:58:14] this
[1:58:16] point I was standing with brother
[1:58:18] Michael Ray in the Bible Museum and the
[1:58:21] Lord showed me a vision that it's laying
[1:58:24] right here that it's time you put up
[1:58:27] your stones and stop throwing on
[1:58:29] everybody else and lift up a shout unto
[1:58:32] the Lord for the Gate of the city is
[1:58:35] yours shout your victories in the room
[1:58:45] shout shout it out the angels in the
[1:58:49] room angels in the room he's moving he's
[1:58:53] working the city is
[1:58:56] yours your problems are
[1:59:00] ceased don't leave them locked
[1:59:03] up come on you done prayed about it you
[1:59:06] done ask the Lord about it but the Bible
[1:59:08] didn't come to you in this generation to
[1:59:10] give you a bound up book but a loose
[1:59:13] book an open seal an open
[1:59:17] voice your
[1:59:20] shout has been
[1:59:24] loosed you're not serving God from some
[1:59:27] Fable you're not serving God from from
[1:59:30] some from some tradition you're not
[1:59:32] serving God out of
[1:59:34] ideology you're serving
[1:59:37] God because the
[1:59:40] shout matches the Angel's
[1:59:46] message let me tell you something too
[1:59:49] many times people have been bound up and
[1:59:53] been told not to shout and been told not
[1:59:55] to praise and been told not to loose
[1:59:57] their mouth because they're afraid they
[2:00:00] can't live to match the message but the
[2:00:04] reason why you're
[2:00:06] shouting the reason why you got a voice
[2:00:08] to shout it's because your life matches
[2:00:12] the
[2:00:13] [Applause]
[2:00:17] message I give you your Liberty in the
[2:00:20] name of Jesus Christ

[2:00:50] I I don't know what you talking about
[2:00:52] brother Angel I'm trying to tell you
[2:00:53] this that on the other side of your
[2:00:56] shout is your
[2:00:59] Victory walls fall when you shout
[2:01:03] oppression leaves when you shout I ain't
[2:01:06] making you emotional I'm trying to
[2:01:08] attach the spiritual parallel between
[2:01:10] the opening of this message to your
[2:01:13] physical manifestation of you enjoying
[2:01:16] the presence of
[2:01:19] God walls fall Giants fall trouble

[2:36:11] brother Jordan sister Beth you forgive
[2:36:14] me for not making mention of this sooner
[2:36:16] but we want to officially welcome them
[2:36:18] to full gossip
[2:36:20] Lighthouse they they made their home
[2:36:22] here this
[2:36:23] week they've been this has been quite
[2:36:25] some Journey for them to get here and we
[2:36:28] just want to welcome them and say God
[2:36:31] richly bless you on your Journeys here I
[2:36:33] think it's a pretty good service to make
[2:36:36] us your home Church in
[2:36:38] and I tell you if the Angel's for you he
[2:36:42] got Victory ahead of
[2:36:43] you so we want to welcome them make them
[2:36:46] feel welcome here and you that's been
[2:36:49] coming and know know the journeys of it
[2:36:50] you know how to pray for them some of
[2:36:53] you don't understand what's going on but
[2:36:55] brother alen had a vision many many
[2:36:57] years ago and uh he probably don't want
[2:37:00] me to tell this but I'm I'm going
[2:37:04] to that uh it's back
[2:37:08] when back when we had some real
[2:37:10] circumstances here and people kind of
[2:37:13] just things
[2:37:15] rejected the Lord showed brother out in
[2:37:18] a uh a church that was on fire before
[2:37:22] God and at that time if you remember we
[2:37:24] probably we probably what maybe 1005 120
[2:37:29] people we don't measure we don't measure
[2:37:31] by numbers that by no means I take five
[2:37:33] that's in the will of God but I just
[2:37:35] want to show you that we're right in
[2:37:38] Step the Lord showed brother alen this
[2:37:40] church exactly like this completely full
[2:37:44] to the brim not of make Believers but
[2:37:47] real believers
[2:37:50] so you're right in line brother
[2:37:52] Shannon so I I just want to tell you if
[2:37:54] you don't you don't like what's going on
[2:37:56] here make room amen make room because we
[2:38:00] got a Rapture to take and we got a body
[2:38:02] to prepare and we're bringing in anybody
[2:38:05] and everybody we don't care what their
[2:38:07] name is don't care their
[2:38:09] circumstances we just want rugged real
[2:38:12] Believers here and the
[2:38:16] vision is coming to pass may God bless
[2:38:20] you today as you go go out reverently I
[2:38:24] know that it's hard sometimes just as
[2:38:27] you're exiting because of those the vest
[2:38:29] of you the way it is but I ask you to be
[2:38:32] very reverent here I know that we have a
[2:38:35] project that is going on but we we want
[2:38:37] to do that reverently as well and I
[2:38:40] think this is a signal to us here
[2:38:43] projects going on weddings that are
[2:38:45] being prepared I think that we ought to
[2:38:49] witness the signaling of the Holy Ghost
[2:38:52] that God has major plans in store for us
[2:38:55] so as you go today go reverently and may
[2:38:58] God's blessings be each be upon each and
[2:39:01] every one of you in the name of the Lord
[2:39:03] Jesus Christ go loving each other and
[2:39:06] loving the Lord we dismiss you today in
[2:39:08] the name of Jesus Christ God richly
[2:39:10] bless
[2:39:16] you oh the way
[2:39:21] I'm going all the
[2:39:25] way oh
[2:39:27] all the
[2:39:28] way
