[14:00] saved him and most of all how god healed
[14:03] him
[14:05] he would always
[14:07] then after telling that stranger about
[14:09] that testimony he most of the time tell
[14:11] a joke
[14:14] and i believe that they would laugh just
[14:15] as much with him laughing
[14:17] and you know what i mean by that because
[14:19] he would laugh as much as he would just
[14:21] shake all over
[14:24] and you would laugh with him just
[14:25] because of his laughter
[14:27] but that was the type of friend he was
[14:29] to us
[14:30] a friend that would make us laugh he was
[14:32] there and in moments where we would sad
[14:35] lift us up
[14:36] he was a comforter to us
[14:40] and
[14:41] during that time he would also ask that
[14:43] same stranger probably if
[14:45] do you have any hunting land
[14:48] because i'd like to run some dogs
[14:52] anyway because harold
[14:54] you you knew where all of his buddies
[14:56] was at because harold when he'd roll in
[14:58] with the dogs all his buddies would roll
[15:00] in too
[15:01] and they could run some bushes
[15:03] they'd run everybody and like harold
[15:05] would always say them dogs can't read
[15:11] harold was a type of friend that was a
[15:12] protector
[15:14] he always enjoyed to protect his
[15:16] grandchildren
[15:17] his family and his friends
[15:19] he would sit at the back of the church
[15:21] there and
[15:23] most evenings as vehicles would come in
[15:25] and out he'd go out to make sure
[15:26] everything was okay make sure everybody
[15:28] was getting in all right
[15:30] another reason why he said at the back
[15:32] is so he could go start the car for
[15:34] denise when it was cool
[15:36] and when he get back in he said all
[15:38] right niece let's go
[15:43] speaking of a protector that brother
[15:45] harold was
[15:46] there was one night that a gentleman
[15:48] come in
[15:49] that wanted money here at the church
[15:51] he was begging for money begging for
[15:53] money and he told harold he said every
[15:55] time i pull my pants up i got a knife on
[15:58] my side
[15:59] harold said well i'd like to tell you
[16:00] every time i pull mine up i got a gun on
[16:02] mine
[16:04] needless to say that gentleman didn't
[16:06] stay around much longer
[16:08] he was a protector
[16:10] we loved brother harold
[16:12] loved him very much
[16:15] and brother harold when
[16:17] many of you know how this goes that when
[16:20] abraham and sarah met the lord they had
[16:22] a name change

[32:21] how did you live a christian life
[32:26] in such a godless day
[32:31] question after question
[32:36] my heroes lifted me
[32:41] then i heard a voice behind

[32:48] tenderly

[35:31] we thank you all for for being here and
[35:34] supporting
[35:35] the family and coming to celebrate the
[35:38] life of
[35:39] our precious brother harold shifflett
[35:41] i would like to first offer my
[35:43] condolences
[35:45] and my sympathy to the family and to say
[35:48] how sorry we are for the passing of our
[35:50] our brother harold
[35:52] we have not lost him
[35:54] because we know exactly where he may be
[35:56] found he was certainly a
[35:59] dear
[36:00] precious brother in christ and
[36:03] everything that you hear
[36:05] and everything that you see today
[36:07] i was just speaking to
[36:09] my dad brother ron
[36:11] i thought how amazing that this is is
[36:14] that you can be gone
[36:16] but you can set this up
[36:18] that everything that is sung here today
[36:20] the words that will be spoken
[36:22] before brother harold was gone
[36:25] he was preparing for this day
[36:28] and just like a a master artsman
[36:31] where the herald was designing this day
[36:34] he picked out each song
[36:36] picked out how things would be laid out
[36:38] and things would be done
[36:40] it's kind of like brother harold's life
[36:43] there's been ups and there's been downs
[36:45] in it
[36:46] but it's like a famous artist
[36:48] he comes and he
[36:50] he doesn't just bring in the sunshine
[36:52] but he brings in the shadows
[36:55] to bring out the magnificence
[36:57] of the rays of light
[36:59] and today we see
[37:02] that our lord jesus christ is very near
[37:05] when you hear him coming when you hear
[37:07] him speaking
[37:09] these are things that brother harold
[37:10] wanted done
[37:12] sister denise
[37:14] last week when brother harold was going
[37:16] for
[37:17] his surgery the lord laid this scripture
[37:20] on my heart
[37:22] the bible says in psalms 34 and 15
[37:26] that the eyes of the lord are upon the
[37:27] righteous
[37:29] and his ears are upon them
[37:32] up open unto their cry
[37:35] the face of the lord is against them
[37:37] that do evil and to cut off the
[37:38] remembrance of them from the earth
[37:40] the righteous cry
[37:42] and the lord heareth and delivereth them
[37:45] out of all their troubles
[37:47] every tear you cried sister denise was
[37:49] not in vain
[37:51] he delivered brother harold out of all
[37:53] of his troubles
[37:56] but the lord is nigh unto them
[37:59] that are of a broken heart
[38:01] and saveth such as be of a contrite
[38:04] spirit
[38:06] and many are the afflictions of the
[38:07] righteous
[38:09] but the lord delivereth him
[38:11] out of all of them
[38:13] david would go on to say that he healeth
[38:16] the broken in heart
[38:18] and he bindeth up their wounds
[38:21] and when jesus would come and he would
[38:22] take the script
[38:24] he would grab over in luke chapter 4 and
[38:27] he would say that the spirit of the lord
[38:29] is upon me
[38:30] to bind up the broken heart
[38:35] our lord jesus is with us today
[38:38] and he told us that he would never leave
[38:40] us nor forsake us
[38:42] and when
[38:44] our loved one cannot be there our lord
[38:46] jesus christ is always there
[38:49] and when you call on the name of the
[38:50] lord he said where two or three are
[38:52] gathered in my name i will be there
[38:55] in the midst of them
[38:57] right now there are cards there are
[38:59] flowers
[39:01] that are coming in there is food galore
[39:03] the refrigerators are full
[39:06] cards are coming in
[39:07] but there will be days
[39:09] in the coming weeks that you may feel
[39:11] like
[39:12] nobody remembers or nobody
[39:15] is caring but our lord jesus christ says
[39:18] that i am the god of all comfort
[39:21] he will be there in your worst moments
[39:24] designing the great artwork of this life
[39:28] and when he was finished with brother
[39:29] harold's life
[39:31] he signed a signature upon it
[39:35] his life
[39:36] is not in vain
[39:41] when you think about harold's life there
[39:43] are many things
[39:45] there are many things that we could say
[39:47] today that we won't bring up
[39:50] because of
[39:52] children's ears
[39:55] but we will certainly miss
[39:57] the enjoyment of of life that harold
[40:00] brought to the table as it were
[40:03] every joke every
[40:06] everything that he would do in his own
[40:08] ways and everybody here every brother
[40:10] and every sister
[40:12] knew that harold cared and cared about
[40:14] them
[40:15] and every brother here
[40:17] that was a hunter has a hunting story
[40:19] that they could
[40:20] share with you
[40:22] or a joke that he'd just heard
[40:24] or if you were playing rook
[40:27] his motto in life was if he ain't
[40:29] cheating he ain't trying
[40:33] there's a lot of things that i
[40:35] that i learned from my buddy and
[40:39] the very first time i ever went turkey
[40:41] hunting i was in my teenage years
[40:44] and it was with my uncle harold
[40:47] and he was teaching me about hunting but
[40:49] he also took upon himself to teach me
[40:52] about something else
[40:53] because he felt like it was an uncle's
[40:55] duty
[40:57] to teach me about the birds and the bees
[41:03] and by the time we got done
[41:05] that day i was no longer concerned about
[41:08] hunting turkeys
[41:14] but concerned with something else
[41:17] i got an education i wish i had a
[41:20] notepad and a pencil that day
[41:26] one of the
[41:27] he probably didn't think this was funny
[41:29] at all but it was one of the greatest
[41:31] memories that i have to date of of
[41:33] harold and
[41:34] we were we were doctoring on some cattle
[41:39] and we had we had this one one cow there
[41:43] a steer that was giving us a fit and we
[41:45] had him in the chute and
[41:47] granddaddy and me tj and matthew were
[41:49] working on this
[41:50] on this cow we were doctoring them up
[41:52] and
[41:53] harold just got off of work and
[41:55] come in and
[41:56] done had a shower he's ready for family
[41:59] dinner there
[42:00] nice clean shirt on
[42:03] smelling purdy
[42:05] and that cow decided that it was it
[42:08] wasn't going to take those shots we was
[42:09] given
[42:11] and that thing bucked down
[42:13] and threw manure all over harold
[42:17] and if you knew harold he couldn't
[42:18] handle it
[42:21] he went up to the water spigot
[42:23] he said that always happens to me
[42:26] right after i get a good shower
[42:30] brother harold was a was a real man
[42:33] there was no funny bones in his body
[42:36] you knew who he was and he knew what he
[42:37] stood for
[42:39] but he believed in the lord jesus christ
[42:41] and it was not a shame like paul said
[42:44] that i am not ashamed of this gospel and
[42:45] the power of its salvation
[42:48] and harold believed in the supernatural
[42:50] power of god and as you have heard today
[42:52] and you'll hear throughout telling his
[42:54] testimony of life
[42:56] that god was a savior and god was a
[42:59] healer
[43:00] brother herald was was a man that we
[43:02] watched here
[43:04] as a church family we watched him
[43:06] receive miracle after miracle
[43:08] and continued to confess
[43:10] that god was a healer
[43:12] brother harold believed in the
[43:13] supernatural power of god in one service
[43:16] we were having a prayer line here and
[43:19] and we were coming around and
[43:21] and brother harold was standing at the
[43:23] back and everybody knows that brother
[43:25] harold was a as brother matthew said was
[43:27] a protector
[43:28] he was standing at the back with sister
[43:29] denise and was making his way around the
[43:31] line making sure others were getting
[43:33] into the line
[43:34] and sister heather schifflett was
[43:36] standing back there in that corner
[43:39] and she was praying about a certain need
[43:42] and brother harold went to her
[43:44] and said sister heather the lord just
[43:46] laid on my heart to to come and say this
[43:49] to you
[43:50] that whatever you're praying for god is
[43:52] going to grant your desire
[43:54] well sister heather was praying for her
[43:56] daughter that was struggling in school
[43:58] and in life at that time
[44:00] and we can look at the life of sister
[44:02] caitlin and we can see that god
[44:04] fulfilled the desire of sister heather
[44:08] brother harold was a real was a real
[44:10] brother in christ and he will certainly
[44:12] be missed
[44:14] but he's not gone neither will he be
[44:16] forgotten
[44:17] his life is etched into our memories
[44:20] and daily we will go in
[44:22] and we'll grab out memories
[44:24] things that brother harold did and
[44:26] things that he would say
[44:29] there's not a time that us boys take
[44:31] lunch without thinking about harold he
[44:33] would look at us
[44:34] he would say boys it's time for a nice
[44:36] hot meal
[44:40] and there's things that we'll go in and
[44:41] grab out of hunting stories i don't
[44:43] think any of us boys could walk into a
[44:45] set of woods anymore without thinking of
[44:47] harold and the things that he would do
[44:49] or say and the best land was just on the
[44:52] other side of that
[44:54] sign there
[44:58] but we'll go in and we'll grab those
[45:00] memories
[45:01] we won't lose those memories
[45:04] but we'll go in and we'll grab those
[45:06] memories and we'll
[45:07] put them in the memory vault and we'll
[45:09] bring them back out and we'll look at
[45:10] them again
[45:13] but we will not forget the one who said
[45:16] to harold i am the resurrection
[45:19] and i am the life
[45:21] and though you were dead
[45:23] yet he shall live again

[1:00:27] you
[1:00:51] today is a difficult day for all of us
[1:00:55] and we're reminded that we're not alone
[1:00:57] but there's another realm that is very
[1:00:59] close to us
[1:01:01] as we heard his father
[1:01:04] tell him in the song go rest high on
[1:01:06] that mountain
[1:01:10] he was part of the welcoming committee
[1:01:11] that
[1:01:12] was with brother homer and many others
[1:01:15] as he was standing when jesus took him
[1:01:17] by the hand
[1:01:19] when doctors could do no more
[1:01:22] harold is loved by every one of us here
[1:01:24] today
[1:01:26] i was his brother-in-law for all of
[1:01:28] these years
[1:01:29] harold and denise were the first ones
[1:01:31] that was married in the brick church
[1:01:34] on summit avenue
[1:01:36] in 1976
[1:01:40] when i came into the family
[1:01:42] harold gave me the same speech he gave
[1:01:44] you
[1:01:48] it's amazing with harold we loved him
[1:01:50] with all of her hearts
[1:01:52] you could go squirrel hunting and come
[1:01:53] home with a deer
[1:01:58] just amazing how that happened you know
[1:02:04] the incredible stories that he told us
[1:02:06] through the years
[1:02:07] his love
[1:02:10] his incredible love for his family
[1:02:13] his wife his children
[1:02:16] he didn't mind telling you about the
[1:02:18] lord
[1:02:20] whether it was at an auction
[1:02:23] or stopping for a sandwich at
[1:02:26] at time to to finish with the deer
[1:02:29] hunting
[1:02:31] he did not appreciate the dogs eating
[1:02:33] these sandwiches
[1:02:36] and he he didn't mind sharing with you
[1:02:38] that he didn't like that
[1:02:41] one of the first visits that he came to
[1:02:43] our house and that time i lived in a in
[1:02:45] a mobile home and
[1:02:47] i it was probably a 14 by 56 mobile home
[1:02:50] and you know how those things are
[1:02:52] and harold had took a shower
[1:02:54] and he was in the shower and i was
[1:02:56] outside washing the car and i was right
[1:02:58] at the window where harold was at and i
[1:03:00] could hear him in the shower in there
[1:03:03] temptation overtook me
[1:03:06] and i began to spray that cold water in
[1:03:08] the shower and i you know you know how
[1:03:10] it is you could hear him running
[1:03:11] backwards and forwards
[1:03:18] niece he thought niece was doing that to
[1:03:21] him
[1:03:29] we were across the mountain one day and
[1:03:31] we were hunting and i'm not going to say
[1:03:32] where because the landowner may be here
[1:03:34] today
[1:03:38] and he had taken me and thomas and them
[1:03:39] and went another way thomas and homer
[1:03:41] went another way and i was with harold
[1:03:43] and harold was going down and was coming
[1:03:45] up this beautiful ridge
[1:03:47] and he stopped me and he said
[1:03:49] he's in a ronald
[1:03:52] if you see anybody
[1:03:54] run
[1:04:04] the other day he called me
[1:04:07] he asked me to come up to the
[1:04:10] house we were going to have this
[1:04:12] conversation
[1:04:14] it was going to be a difficult one
[1:04:17] he'd went to the doctor that day and
[1:04:18] they had told him to begin to prepare
[1:04:21] for today
[1:04:23] and he asked me to speak his funeral
[1:04:26] there that day
[1:04:30] as luck would be the chance i got the
[1:04:32] same conversation the doctor it must
[1:04:34] have been the day for doctors to tell
[1:04:35] the patients this
[1:04:37] the doctor told me to get my funeral
[1:04:39] arrangements ready
[1:04:42] we kind of joked about it who would be
[1:04:44] first
[1:04:45] well i guess i'm getting to fulfill the
[1:04:47] duties of speaking his funeral
[1:04:51] he knew death was coming
[1:05:04] this life is way too short
[1:05:08] it's just way too short
[1:05:12] the one thing that i can share with you
[1:05:14] today
[1:05:15] is appreciate every day that you have
[1:05:22] and if you neglect to appreciate it
[1:05:24] it'll slip by your way too quick
[1:05:29] harold's was
[1:05:31] complications of diseases of a heart
[1:05:36] kidneys
[1:05:39] and a multiplicity of other things that
[1:05:41] was attacking his body
[1:05:46] minor stage four cancer
[1:05:48] that's in the brain and in the lungs and
[1:05:51] a lot of other places now
[1:05:54] but i can tell you this in a few days
[1:05:58] i'll shake his hand
[1:06:00] and we'll both be young again
[1:06:04] and we're going to be all right
[1:06:07] i read a
[1:06:09] story by d.o moody i think it's a good
[1:06:11] good place to
[1:06:12] share it
[1:06:17] said so very sorry to hear
[1:06:20] this but if you could only grasp
[1:06:23] what heaven
[1:06:24] is really like
[1:06:27] then you would feel sorry for those
[1:06:30] who are left here
[1:06:33] this present earth in its condition at
[1:06:35] its best
[1:06:38] the closest redeemed
[1:06:41] will ever come to hell
[1:06:43] that's quite a statement and for the
[1:06:46] sinner it is the closest they will ever
[1:06:48] come
[1:06:50] to living in heaven
[1:06:54] our stay here on this earth is
[1:06:57] in its fallen condition is only a place
[1:06:59] of preparation
[1:07:02] to go to a place where we
[1:07:04] truly live
[1:07:07] your loved one
[1:07:09] made his preparation
[1:07:12] he lived for this moment
[1:07:16] we have something to rejoice in that
[1:07:19] you do not lose him
[1:07:21] because you know where
[1:07:23] he's at
[1:07:27] dr luna
[1:07:30] would have liked to have been here
[1:07:31] sitting in the company today
[1:07:34] i was just with him on wednesday
[1:07:37] we shared a lot of stories about harold
[1:07:39] and
[1:07:40] homer
[1:07:43] he loved harold
[1:07:47] and he said i'd love to come he said but
[1:07:48] i'm running a
[1:07:50] a vaccination clinic for children
[1:07:52] and he said i got it all together i'm
[1:07:54] going to vaccinate a hundred children
[1:07:57] to covet
[1:07:58] he said i'd love to come
[1:08:00] and i just looked up at him and i said
[1:08:02] if if you'll write something down i'll
[1:08:05] read it for you and i'll do my best to
[1:08:07] represent you
[1:08:09] he's a caring doctor he's a loving
[1:08:11] doctor
[1:08:14] he said to mr shifflet and all of his
[1:08:16] family
[1:08:18] it was an honor and a real pleasure to
[1:08:21] care for you during the good days and
[1:08:24] the bad days
[1:08:26] i always cherished your visit
[1:08:28] where despite your ailments you always
[1:08:30] had trust in me and in your loving and
[1:08:33] your lovely wife who was always there
[1:08:37] for you every single minute
[1:08:40] i am sure that you were very
[1:08:42] much deserving of the love and she has
[1:08:45] always had for you
[1:08:47] i will miss your visits
[1:08:50] but will remember fondly our time
[1:08:52] together
[1:08:53] when i see the rest of your family in my
[1:08:55] office
[1:08:56] where we also
[1:08:58] share good memories
[1:09:01] i have of your
[1:09:02] dear father-in-law
[1:09:05] warmest regards
[1:09:07] max luna
[1:09:13] that doctor could only take him so far
[1:09:17] they care
[1:09:19] they try to help suffering humanity
[1:09:22] but i'm thankful to god that we have a
[1:09:24] higher doctor
[1:09:27] and he is the great physician
[1:09:30] that knows how to heal a broken body
[1:09:33] when it comes to his end
[1:09:36] brother harold arranged who the
[1:09:38] pallbearers would be
[1:09:40] his honorary son
[1:09:43] brother jeremy do you have a picture for
[1:09:45] me
[1:09:54] all right
[1:09:56] are we coming
[1:10:03] his honorary son killed this buck this
[1:10:05] morning
[1:10:06] brother justin
[1:10:08] brother justin was
[1:10:11] wanting to save it for harold but
[1:10:13] harold didn't get to make that
[1:10:15] appointment
[1:10:16] i think it's kind of neat how god
[1:10:18] arranges certain things on certain days
[1:10:21] and when you think there's no god
[1:10:23] he really cares about those things that
[1:10:25] you care about
[1:10:27] god bless you brother justin
[1:10:30] you like the rest of us he taught us how
[1:10:32] to hunt
[1:10:33] taught us how to love and how to care
[1:10:36] and i thought it was just really special
[1:10:38] i hope that was alright to share with
[1:10:39] this audience today god bless you
[1:10:42] may you take the things that you've
[1:10:44] learned from harold and some of them
[1:10:50] and share with your children
[1:10:55] i'd like to thank brother mike and
[1:10:56] brother lloyd walls for being here from
[1:10:58] richmond in washington they were dear
[1:11:01] friends to brother harold thank each and
[1:11:03] every one of you that are here today
[1:11:06] neighbors friends co-workers
[1:11:08] family members thank you for being here
[1:11:11] in psalms chapter 46 he says god is our
[1:11:14] refuge
[1:11:16] and a strength and a
[1:11:18] very present help and trouble
[1:11:21] therefore we'll
[1:11:22] not we fear though the earth be removed
[1:11:26] and though mountains be carried into the
[1:11:28] midst of the sea
[1:11:29] though the waters thereof roar and be
[1:11:32] troubled
[1:11:33] though the mountains shake and the
[1:11:34] swelling thereof
[1:11:36] there is a river the streams whereof
[1:11:38] shall make glad the city of god
[1:11:41] the holy place the tabernacle
[1:11:43] of the most high
[1:11:46] god is in the midst of her
[1:11:48] she shall not be moved
[1:11:50] god shall help her and be right early
[1:11:52] the heathen raged and the king was
[1:11:54] removed and he utterly uttered his voice
[1:11:57] and the earth melted
[1:11:59] the lord of hosts is with us
[1:12:01] the god of jacob our refuge
[1:12:05] jesus turned to his disciples knowing
[1:12:08] moments like this would come
[1:12:10] and he says let not your heart be
[1:12:12] troubled you believe in god believe also
[1:12:15] in me
[1:12:16] in my father's house are many mansions
[1:12:18] and if it were not so i would have told
[1:12:21] you i go to prepare a place for you
[1:12:25] and if i go and prepare a place for you
[1:12:27] i will come again and receive you unto
[1:12:29] myself
[1:12:30] that where i am
[1:12:32] there you may be also
[1:12:35] understand brother harold this is just
[1:12:37] the temporary house that he lived in
[1:12:40] these 65 years
[1:12:42] jesus built him a house
[1:12:45] a house without sin a house that will
[1:12:48] never be touched by heart problems
[1:12:50] kidney problems
[1:12:52] situations and pressures of life
[1:12:56] it's a house built like the lord's
[1:12:58] himself
[1:12:59] jesus would say this through the through
[1:13:02] the prophet david the lord is my
[1:13:04] shepherd and i shall not want
[1:13:07] he provides everything that we have need
[1:13:10] of
[1:13:11] he maketh me to lie down in green
[1:13:13] pastures and he leadeth me beside of the
[1:13:16] still waters
[1:13:17] he restoreth my soul and he leadeth me
[1:13:19] in the past of righteousness for his
[1:13:22] namesake
[1:13:23] yea though i walk through the valley of
[1:13:25] the shadow of death
[1:13:26] i will fear no evil for thou art with me
[1:13:29] and let me just say this to you
[1:13:31] men can only take you so far
[1:13:34] our mate can only go so far with us
[1:13:38] but aren't you glad sister denise
[1:13:41] that you knew when he left your hand
[1:13:44] he had the hand of a man that had a scar
[1:13:46] in it
[1:13:49] and that's the only man-made thing in
[1:13:51] heaven is the scar
[1:13:54] and that scar paid the price of
[1:13:56] redemption
[1:13:57] and you took his hand and put it into
[1:13:59] his hand
[1:14:01] and he could take him the rest of the
[1:14:02] way
[1:14:05] sister mary betty
[1:14:08] life is not made for us to watch our
[1:14:10] children perish
[1:14:13] it's not made it's not the natural cycle
[1:14:15] of life
[1:14:17] the natural cycle is the opposite way
[1:14:20] but your comfort today is
[1:14:22] harold's not in that box
[1:14:26] he's watching from another realm
[1:14:29] and he's standing where a reunion has
[1:14:31] taken place
[1:14:32] and he
[1:14:34] and your beloved husband is standing
[1:14:36] together
[1:14:38] maybe sharing some stories just now
[1:14:41] and this is not disney and it's not a
[1:14:43] fairy tale
[1:14:46] jesus said i'm going to take you through
[1:14:48] the valley of the shadow of death and
[1:14:50] i'm going to walk with you
[1:14:52] it's been quoted before i'll never leave
[1:14:54] you and i'll never forsake you
[1:14:58] man will fail his promises
[1:15:01] if you don't believe that just try
[1:15:03] washington d.c
[1:15:06] but god will never fail
[1:15:09] he's never lied he's never failed he's
[1:15:12] never been in a crisis
[1:15:15] when adam fell in the garden of eden
[1:15:18] god made a way back
[1:15:21] because you and i was in god
[1:15:24] and when jesus was laying in the tomb
[1:15:27] and the scripture says i will not suffer
[1:15:29] my holy one to seek corruption you was
[1:15:32] in jesus
[1:15:33] and satan couldn't get to you then
[1:15:36] he can't get to you now
[1:15:40] understand this now
[1:15:43] satan has done his worst damage that he
[1:15:45] could do to herald but he can never
[1:15:48] touch him again
[1:15:51] let me just say this to you if you
[1:15:52] haven't made the preparation for this
[1:15:54] moment
[1:15:55] like brother harold because brother
[1:15:57] harold had
[1:16:00] he had warning that this was coming amen
[1:16:05] he had a warning that it was coming
[1:16:07] this did not take him by surprise
[1:16:11] he made a preparation
[1:16:13] but he started making preparations
[1:16:16] decades
[1:16:17] ago
[1:16:18] when brother homer was looking for a
[1:16:20] church and by vision it would be a
[1:16:22] church just up the hill here
[1:16:24] where the ceiling was falling in
[1:16:27] and it would be a place that was right
[1:16:29] across the road from harold's family
[1:16:32] because god needed to get harold and
[1:16:34] denise together
[1:16:36] so it was more than getting a church
[1:16:38] building you see god's been at work a
[1:16:40] long time at this
[1:16:42] you can't beat god's program he knows
[1:16:45] how to put things together
[1:16:48] as i've marveled as this service has
[1:16:50] been so well put together i want you to
[1:16:53] understand god has watched over i'm
[1:16:55] thankful that we've got somebody that
[1:16:57] can watch over us and as a child of god
[1:17:00] psalms 91 tells us that the angels of
[1:17:03] god are standing watching over us
[1:17:07] we are protected greater than the
[1:17:09] president of the united states
[1:17:11] we're protected better than any diplomat
[1:17:14] in the entire world let me just say this
[1:17:17] to you
[1:17:18] harold was protected the other day
[1:17:21] when an operation with incredible
[1:17:24] risk was involved
[1:17:28] willing to do whatever
[1:17:34] harold was a friend of this church
[1:17:39] he was a friend to you
[1:17:43] he loved you
[1:17:44] he cared for you
[1:17:47] jesus was this kind of a friend
[1:17:51] there was a time when jesus's personal
[1:17:53] friend
[1:17:56] was
[1:17:56] sick and was dying
[1:18:02] and it seemed like jesus went the
[1:18:04] opposite direction
[1:18:07] his disciples would even ask him about
[1:18:08] it
[1:18:10] and jesus would turn to him and said
[1:18:12] he's sleeping
[1:18:16] like all humanity we don't understand
[1:18:18] death a lot of times
[1:18:22] when he turns and starts making his way
[1:18:24] back to their house
[1:18:26] news is coming that lazarus has passed
[1:18:29] away
[1:18:35] it doesn't deter the commission that
[1:18:38] jesus is on his way
[1:18:42] mourners are there
[1:18:46] they've already placed him in the tomb
[1:18:50] and his sister asked him
[1:18:52] about him and he said he'll rise again
[1:18:56] and he said well she said well i know
[1:18:59] that he'll raise on that resurrection
[1:19:00] day
[1:19:02] and he explains to her that
[1:19:04] i am the resurrection
[1:19:06] and i am the life
[1:19:08] now we marvel at him turning water into
[1:19:11] the best wine
[1:19:13] that there could possibly be at the
[1:19:15] marriage feast
[1:19:17] as a matter of fact if you go back and
[1:19:19] look at it in history
[1:19:20] he didn't just turn a little teaspoon
[1:19:23] he turned 62 gallons
[1:19:26] of water
[1:19:28] into the best wine
[1:19:30] in the hole in the whole community
[1:19:37] when he told
[1:19:39] the boys that were fishing
[1:19:41] cast your net on the other side they
[1:19:43] said lord we tear it all night there
[1:19:44] ain't no fish in the sea
[1:19:50] cast your net
[1:19:53] because he knew the fish was there
[1:19:55] when peter he turned to him one day when
[1:19:57] they had a tax situation
[1:20:00] and he said
[1:20:01] take the hook
[1:20:03] and go fish
[1:20:05] in its mouth
[1:20:07] you're going to find money
[1:20:11] harold would tell you sit here sit here
[1:20:13] at the street
[1:20:14] don't move
[1:20:15] i'll come back for you
[1:20:18] or he may tell you to stand at a certain
[1:20:20] spot when the dogs were running
[1:20:22] and he came running by me one day and he
[1:20:24] said did the dogs come this way and i
[1:20:25] said no but i think they went up on the
[1:20:27] mountain
[1:20:29] the mountain was the park he said you
[1:20:31] know them dogs can't read
[1:20:39] and jesus told peter
[1:20:43] they'll catch a fish it's got money in
[1:20:44] it i want to say this with absolute
[1:20:47] consolation to you today without a
[1:20:50] shadow of a doubt
[1:20:53] harold is not dead
[1:20:57] but he actually lives better now than
[1:21:00] he's ever lived in this temporary life
[1:21:05] it is we that
[1:21:07] should be sorry
[1:21:09] a lot of regrets in life a lot of times
[1:21:11] that you may have missed i
[1:21:13] maybe you were too busy to have a
[1:21:15] certain conversation
[1:21:18] but let me just let me just share this
[1:21:20] with you as i end
[1:21:24] don't be too busy
[1:21:26] to spend time with jesus
[1:21:31] don't be too busy
[1:21:33] any of you knew harold knew he was not
[1:21:35] shy
[1:21:37] about talking about the lord
[1:21:40] and he wasn't ashamed of him
[1:21:43] he was our greeter here at this church
[1:21:46] he said on the he was set many times on
[1:21:49] that on our on our steps out there
[1:21:52] and greeted people as they came in
[1:21:55] he was quick to go out and greet whoever
[1:21:57] was coming
[1:21:58] make sure everything was all right
[1:22:00] whether you know he was our guardian
[1:22:02] angel here at the church
[1:22:05] we're going to miss him
[1:22:08] but not for long
[1:22:12] because god made us a promise
[1:22:15] amen
[1:22:16] and i like how god operates
[1:22:19] he makes us a
[1:22:22] promise buddy we'll miss him
[1:22:27] he'll miss his laughs
[1:22:30] miss his stories
[1:22:33] we'll miss those those deer stories
[1:22:35] especially
[1:22:41] what we'll miss more than anything is
[1:22:43] his love for us
[1:22:45] because he shared it
[1:22:48] it was on his cuff
[1:22:50] he didn't hide his love for you denise
[1:22:53] he loved you
[1:22:54] he didn't hide his love for you girls
[1:22:57] matt he didn't hide his love for you
[1:23:00] he didn't hide it at all
[1:23:02] when his last conversation was got to
[1:23:04] get a bigger buggy
[1:23:09] death was coming down but he was ready
[1:23:10] to get a bigger buggy so that you guys
[1:23:12] could could go hunting
[1:23:18] thank you
[1:23:18] harold thank you
