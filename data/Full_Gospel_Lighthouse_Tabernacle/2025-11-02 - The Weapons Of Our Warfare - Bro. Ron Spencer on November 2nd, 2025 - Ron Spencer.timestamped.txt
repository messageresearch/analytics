[22:27] [singing]
[22:27] my days.
[22:31] Why don't you just talk to the Lord
[22:32] right there?
[22:34] Won't you just have a conversation with
[22:36] Elohim this morning? Just thank him for
[22:39] being the God of all your days. Go ahead
[22:42] and talk to him right now. Maybe you
[22:45] just want to spend a moment in prayer
[22:47] thanking him for this moment that you
[22:49] can thank him, that you can praise him.
[22:52] Don't be ashamed of who's beside you.
[22:54] Don't be ashamed of your past. Don't be
[22:56] ashamed of what's going to be in your
[22:58] future. I know this that Jesus [music]
[23:00] does Jesus does make a way for you.
[23:04] Jesus does love you and Jesus will heal
[23:07] you. He is that kind of a God.
[23:11] Go ahead and talk to the master [music]
[23:13] just now. Father, we love you. Father,
[23:16] we praise you, Lord Jesus, for the
[23:18] morning that we've been given today to
[23:20] be able to call upon the God of I,
[23:22] Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob to realize
[23:25] that you're more than enough, Lord
[23:27] Jesus, this morning to reach down to our
[23:30] needs, oh God. We pray that this morning
[23:32] in this service that your presence would
[23:34] be felt and known, oh God, to every
[23:36] wavered son and daughter of God. We
[23:38] pray, Father, that you would be God to
[23:41] them today. Lord, in this service, we
[23:43] are expecting the supernatural.
[23:45] &gt;&gt; [music]
[23:45] &gt;&gt; We pray that healing would take place.
[23:47] You would go by the broken hearts this
[23:49] morning. You would go by the tendered
[23:51] eyes this morning. And you would
[23:53] minister to them in a supernatural way.
[23:56] Every mother that is dealing with a
[23:57] little [singing] bitty baby [music]
[23:58] today that may not be able to receive
[24:00] certain things from the presence of God.
[24:03] Maybe not be able to hear every word
[24:04] that is spoken. But I pray that you do
[24:07] something special for them today. May
[24:09] they feel the presence of El Shadi and
[24:12] may they draw upon the breasted one. As
[24:14] brother Ron will begin to minister the
[24:16] word of life today, we pray that the
[24:18] Holy Ghost would use the man of God to
[24:20] speak to our lives, to our situations.
[24:22] OH GOD, WE LOOK TO YOU TODAY. WE LOOK
[24:25] AWAY to you not of a Jesus of 2,000
[24:28] years ago, but we look away to this
[24:30] Jesus today, the same yesterday, today,
[24:33] and forever. So, Father, we'll give you
[24:35] praise and we'll love on you this
[24:37] morning in the name of Jesus Christ.
[24:40] [music] Amen. Let the church resound
[24:42] with praises unto the most high God.
[24:45] Hallelujah.
[24:47] Hallelujah. Blessed be the name of the
[24:50] most high God. Do you love on the Lord
[24:53] Jesus this morning? Do you love him?
[24:57] &gt;&gt; Do you love him?
[24:59] &gt;&gt; Then let heaven and earth hear you say,
[25:00] "I love you, Lord Jesus.
[25:03] I love you, Lord Jesus. I love you. I
[25:06] love you. I love you. I love you. I love
[25:08] you. Amen. Amen. We're going to get
[25:11] ready to go to the prayer requests
[25:13] [music] this morning. We got many needs
[25:16] amongst us as a local body, but our God
[25:19] knows every one [music] of them. And I'm
[25:22] so thankful to know that he's a healer
[25:24] this morning. So we take these needs not
[25:26] before not before an empty vessel, but
[25:30] we take them before the most powerful
[25:31] people that have the ability to go out
[25:34] and speak worlds into [music] existence.
[25:36] It isn't just for something in the past,
[25:39] but I believe that right here in this
[25:41] place that [music] the Holy Spirit can
[25:42] get a hold of you brothers and you
[25:44] sisters and you can start changing the
[25:47] very [music] very molecular status of
[25:49] people's life and cancer cells can turn
[25:52] into good cells. I believe you have that
[25:54] ability. When you pray, you're not
[25:56] talking to a weak God. You're talking to
[25:58] Almighty God. We want to bring our
[26:01] pastor, Brother Ron, before the Lord
[26:03] today and ask that God would minister to
[26:05] him. Sister Wanda needs a touch from the
[26:08] Lord. Brother Jeff Breeden, all of these
[26:11] these individuals, [music] these are
[26:12] saints of God
[26:14] &gt;&gt; that need a touch from the master.
[26:15] Sister Terresa Delaney fighting cancer.
[26:17] [music] We pray that our Lord Jesus
[26:19] Christ would go by their way and just
[26:22] touch them. I believe he's more than
[26:24] able. For Sister Judy Hensley, needing
[26:26] needing to be remembered in [music]
[26:27] prayer. Sister June Shifflet needs a
[26:29] touch from the Lord. We were able to go
[26:31] by there yesterday evening before
[26:33] service and just spend some time in
[26:35] prayer with [music] her. We pray that
[26:37] God would minister to her. Our song
[26:39] leader, Brother Matthew, is at UVA today
[26:42] trying [music] to get some help and find
[26:43] some some avenues to to get uh find what
[26:47] the matter is in his back. Needs a real
[26:49] touch [music] from the Lord. the saints
[26:51] there in Jamaica that have been wiped
[26:54] out by this past hurricane. We just pray

[27:08] requests. How many has a need this
[27:09] morning?
[27:14] You realize what you [music] just did?
[27:17] You broke the atmosphere.
[27:20] Brother Brandon would say it one time.
[27:21] He said, he [music] said, 'You seen that
[27:22] sister? He said, just raise that hand
[27:24] like that. He said, 'The reason why she
[27:26] did that? He said, the pillar fire was
[27:27] going over right there. You're not
[27:30] raising your hand to a man. You're
[27:32] raising your hand to Elohim that is in
[27:34] [music] this room that can meet these
[27:36] needs. Let's talk to the father today as
[27:37] brother Randall prays.
[27:42] Bow our heads this morning. Lord, you've
[27:44] heard the requests have been brought
[27:46] forth across this [music] pulpit, Lord.
[27:48] Lord, there are strong requests. Lord,
[27:51] asking for you to touch these saints,
[27:53] Lord, they're dealing with cancer. Lord,
[27:55] I just pray you'll reach down and touch
[27:57] each and every one of them, Lord. Lord,
[27:59] rejuvenate [music]
[28:00] themselves, Lord. Give them the energies
[28:03] they need to come back into their
[28:04] bodies, Lord. Lord, we know you can
[28:06] touch them, Lord. I've seen it in the

[28:28] there with them, Lord God. You didn't
[28:30] turn their back on them, Lord. This is
[28:32] just another thing of the devil, Lord,
[28:33] to try to destroy the work that [music]
[28:35] you've got going in this world, Lord. I
[28:37] pray you just reach down and be with
[28:39] each and every one of them today. Lord,

[28:48] every one of us this morning, Lord. Be
[28:51] with the ministry this morning, Lord, as
[28:52] it brings forth the word, Lord. I pray
[28:55] you'll give him strength as he preaches,
[28:56] Lord. [music] He pours out his heart to
[28:59] the bride, Lord. Using the gift you give
[29:02] him, Lord. I just pray you be with him,
[29:04] Lord. Give him [music] the strength and
[29:05] the energies to to speak out what you've
[29:08] put on his heart this morning, Lord. and

[48:39] but we was. We had Europe covered. And
[48:42] so, and so I I tell you, these guys did
[48:45] an awesome job. I know you appreciated
[48:48] that. Had a wonderful time. You're
[48:50] you're a wonderful audience to preach
[48:52] to. And and so we had a wonderful time
[48:54] in France. incredible meetings and with
[48:57] brother Tim and brother Timothy, brother
[48:59] David Mayor uh their their church
[49:02] sponsored those meetings and uh
[49:04] beautiful meetings and uh couple hundred
[49:07] people from all over the place came with
[49:10] expectation and God met their
[49:12] expectation. We met some people from Ro
[49:15] Romania and uh they watch our services
[49:19] after service and so uh after our
[49:22] service after their service they come
[49:24] home and watch our service. There was a
[49:26] girl there that was suffering in great
[49:27] darkness and a lot of bad things that
[49:30] was going on in her life and they
[49:32] watched our service and uh this is her
[49:37] and so they travel from Romania to meet
[49:39] us. And so uh they're they're kin to the
[49:44] pastor some way or another. And so
[49:46] anyway uh I thought this was important
[49:49] because brother Williams father was a
[49:51] translator for that country from the
[49:54] voice of God. And so she had she had
[49:57] darkness had covered her seemed like the
[49:59] end of her life. And during the
[50:01] preaching of the word as we spoke here,
[50:04] God just ministered to her in a special
[50:07] way. And so we thank the Lord for that.
[50:11] We thank the Lord for that. [applause]
[50:16] Amen.
[50:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we're just thankful for that.
[50:21] that God would just do an incredible
[50:24] thing. And isn't he wonderful?
[50:27] &gt;&gt; We had great trip there. Uh the meeting
[50:30] was great. On Monday morning, I got
[50:32] violently sick and we had talked about
[50:35] flying on Tuesday. Thank God we didn't.
[50:38] And I stayed violently sick from the
[50:40] medicine uh through Tuesday and then we
[50:43] were had a good day Wednesday and then
[50:45] we flew home on Thursday and God was
[50:48] blessing to us and we went back to work
[50:50] with the boys on Friday. So thank God
[50:53] for his strength.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. You love the Lord.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:58] &gt;&gt; Ain't he good to us? Amen.
[51:02] Amen. I'd like to turn to second
[51:04] Corinthians chapter 10 this morning.
[51:13] I'd like to speak to you on the weapons
[51:16] of our warfare.
[51:19] Our
[51:22] nation has just
[51:24] realizes where we're at
[51:27] and
[51:30] they're going to begin to
[51:33] retest or test our nuclear to see kind
[51:37] of where we're at. And uh America's
[51:41] supposed to have some of the best
[51:42] weapons there is. Russia, China, all
[51:45] these little countries have incredible
[51:48] weapons.
[51:49] But I want to remind the devil today
[51:51] that we got the best.
[51:56] &gt;&gt; We don't need to have a parade.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[52:00] &gt;&gt; All we got to do is to come to church
[52:04] &gt;&gt; and stretch our muscles a little bit.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; Today, I want to talk about our weapons
[52:11] of warfare.
[52:13] Amen. Now, we're not pacifist.
[52:16] We're We're not people that, you know,
[52:18] just stay out of wars.
[52:20] We're fighters.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; Maybe I'll say that again. We're
[52:26] fighters.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; And if you're not a fighter,
[52:31] &gt;&gt; you're not going to make it.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; You've got to overcome this leodysian
[52:37] age.
[52:38] You just can't float by and float here
[52:41] and float there and go there like a like
[52:45] a a piece of wood on the river. You have
[52:49] got to fight.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[52:53] &gt;&gt; God just didn't leave you here to fight
[52:55] on your own.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; He gave you the best weapons that he
[52:59] could give you.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; And that's the word of the Lord. 2
[53:03] Corinthians chapter 10 and verse three.
[53:06] For though we walk in the flesh,
[53:10] we do not war after the flesh. For the
[53:13] weapons of our warfare are not carnal,
[53:17] but mighty through God to the pulling
[53:19] down of the strongholds, casting down
[53:22] imaginations and every high thing, and
[53:24] exalted itself against the knowledge of
[53:26] God, and bringing into captivity every
[53:29] thought to the obedience of Christ.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; Psalms chapter 46 and verse one.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[53:38] &gt;&gt; the God of our refuge and the strength,
[53:41] a very present help in the time of
[53:43] trouble. Therefore will not we fear,
[53:46] though war, though the earth be removed,
[53:49] and though the mountains be carried into
[53:51] the midst of the sea, though the waters
[53:54] thereof roar and be troubled, though the
[53:56] mountains shake with the swelling
[53:58] thereof. There is a river and the
[54:00] streams whereof shall make glad the city
[54:04] of God. the holy place of the
[54:07] tabernacles of the most high. God is in
[54:10] the midst of her and she shall not be
[54:12] moved. God will shall help her and that
[54:16] right early. The heathen raged and the
[54:18] kings were moved. He uttered his voice
[54:21] and the earth melted. The Lord of hosts
[54:24] is with us. The God of Jacob is our
[54:27] refuge. Come behold the works of our
[54:30] Lord and what desolation he hath made in
[54:33] the earth. He maketh wars to cease unto
[54:36] the ends of the earth. He breakth the
[54:38] bow and cutth the spear into sunder. He
[54:41] burneth the chariot in the fire. Be
[54:43] still and know that I am God.
[54:47] And I will be exalted among the heathen.
[54:49] I will be exalted in the earth. The Lord
[54:53] of hosts is with us. The God of Jacob is
[54:57] our refuge.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; You may be seated this evening. God
[55:01] bless you. May the Lord bless the
[55:03] reading of his word.
[55:07] Psalms Proverbs chapter 18 and verse 10.
[55:11] The Lord
[55:13] the name of the Lord is a strong tower.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; The name of the Lord is a strong tower
[55:26] &gt;&gt; and the righteous run into it and it is
[55:29] saved.
[55:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:32] He says, "You've got," Brother Random
[55:34] says, he said, "you've got to go do it.
[55:37] You've got to fight for every inch of
[55:40] ground that you have."
[55:44] &gt;&gt; Every man in here that's born again of
[55:46] the spirit of God knows that you have
[55:49] had to fight for every inch of ground,
[55:53] tow the mark with Satan. Isn't that
[55:55] right, friends? This is not a picnic.
[55:59] This is a battleground. And he says, "We
[56:03] never come here to eat cookies and and
[56:07] so forth. We're in a battle."
[56:12] &gt;&gt; Hate to wake you up,
[56:14] &gt;&gt; but we're in a battle. Yes.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; Could you imagine the United States Army
[56:20] training a man to sit around and eat
[56:23] cookies and so forth while he gives him
[56:25] a uniform and his gun and trains him to
[56:29] get out there with fight and to and
[56:32] defend the nation? That's what we've got
[56:35] to do. We've got to defend our God-given
[56:38] rights.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; He said what God said, it's ours. Let's
[56:45] stand right toe-to-toe with Satan
[56:49] and ashamed. He says, "It puts me in the
[56:52] mind of something that like ourselves."
[56:54] Then then I said to the people, I'm
[56:56] getting to a spot. I need to have more
[56:58] faith. That's what what's what that's
[57:02] what I'm home for now is to get a new
[57:05] burst of faith. So go on. He said, "Look
[57:10] like when you pray the people you
[57:13] apologize, Mr. Devil, would you please
[57:16] move over and and let me nothing?
[57:21] &gt;&gt; He said fight has faith has muscles
[57:27] &gt;&gt; and hair on its chest
[57:30] &gt;&gt; and when it speaks EVERYTHING ELSE SHUTS
[57:34] UP.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Don't go in and tell Mr.
[57:40] Devil you move out. HE SAID GET OUT OF
[57:42] HERE. I'M A SON OF GOD. Commissioned of
[57:46] God. Leave them alone.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; That moves. He said, "YOU HAVE NO
[57:52] APOLOGIES TO THE DEVIL."
[57:55] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; As bad as the devil's treated some of
[57:58] you, you don't have to apologize to him.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; Listen, this is no political correctness
[58:04] when we're fighting the devil.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; You have no apology to the devil.
[58:12] nothing to DO WITH HIM. NOT ASHAMED OF
[58:15] THE WORD OF GOD. NOT ASHAMED TO YOUR
[58:17] COMMISSION. NOT ASHAMED TO TO OF WHO YOU
[58:20] ARE.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; The only shame THAT I AM IS I'M a
[58:25] Brandham.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; I'm ashamed.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; I'm a Spencer.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; But I got a higher calling.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; That's my earthly birth. I'm ashamed of
[58:37] my failures. I believe we could all say
[58:39] that.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BUT AS HIS SERVANT, I'M NOT
[58:43] ASHAMED. I'm not ashamed of his word.
[58:46] Whether it's whether it's denomination,
[58:48] kings, potentates, whatever it might be,
[58:51] just ready TO GIVE AN ANSWER. GOD CALLS
[58:53] for it.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; Hebrews chapter 13 and verse 8. It's our
[58:57] theme. It is Jesus Christ, the name
[59:00] above all names.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ, the same yesterday
[59:07] &gt;&gt; and today.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND FOREVER.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; Matthew chapter 16 and verse 18. AND I
[59:16] SAY ALSO UNTO THEE THAT THOU art Peter,
[59:20] and upon this rock, the revelation of
[59:23] who he is, I will build my church, and
[59:27] the gates of hell, which is the
[59:29] strongest part,
[59:32] &gt;&gt; shall not prevail against it,
[59:34] &gt;&gt; and I will give unto thee the keys of
[59:36] the kingdom. I like that. the kingdom of
[59:40] heaven. AND WHATSOEVER THOU SHALT BIND
[59:42] on earth shall be bound in heaven. And
[59:45] whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth
[59:48] shall be loosed in heaven.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; So I believe we can sit here and look
[59:53] across this audience and say we're part
[59:55] of the most powerful people on the
[59:57] earth.
[1:00:00] We just drove through Geneva,
[1:00:02] Switzerland, and we took pictures of the
[1:00:06] the building to where that they all all
[1:00:09] the leaders of the world come together
[1:00:11] and every flag from all over the earth
[1:00:13] is is there and all down through what a
[1:00:16] beautiful place it is. But it's a it's a
[1:00:19] place where nations gather in this very
[1:00:23] very neutral place to have a conference.
[1:00:26] conferences to try to settle different
[1:00:28] things and differences out the earth.
[1:00:31] They gather THE MOST POWERFUL PEOPLE
[1:00:34] THAT there are.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; But I BELIEVE THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST
[1:00:39] THAT HAS BEEN WRAPPED around this
[1:00:40] message
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; ARE THE MOST POWERFUL PEOPLE ON THE
[1:00:46] EARTH.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; Who has more power in heaven, a son and
[1:00:52] a daughter OF GOD OR AN ANGEL? LISTEN,
[1:00:58] never forget who you are.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; Did that extra hour of sleep
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; cause you guys to be dead?
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; Turn to your neighbor. Say, "Wake up.
[1:01:23] Listen, I don't want to waste an hour
[1:01:24] here.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; I'm not here to waste your hour.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; If we're going to waste an hour, we'll
[1:01:30] go eat cookies somewhere another.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; I'm here to This is the most important
[1:01:37] thing we're going to do all week.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; Going to Walmart is the mo not the most
[1:01:42] important thing. [applause]
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; That's right. Your job is not the most
[1:01:49] important thing.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; Heavens and earth
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; will pass away.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; And the earth that we are on right now,
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; this beautiful place that we are in
[1:02:01] right now won't be long will be ashes.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; It won't be long. It'll be ashes.
[1:02:11] Brother Andrew, I hope I don't steal
[1:02:13] your thunder, but this morning he just
[1:02:14] told a story about Poland and going
[1:02:17] through Oawitch and going through those
[1:02:20] horrific places. There's people that
[1:02:22] don't even believe that that that even
[1:02:24] happened that that that those
[1:02:27] concentration camps and millions and
[1:02:30] millions of Jews were killed in those
[1:02:33] concentration camps. I can't imagine
[1:02:36] that people have come to the place to
[1:02:38] where well that didn't happen.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; Well, let me just say the reason that
[1:02:43] they they don't want to believe that is
[1:02:47] because it's going to happen again.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; I don't want to be here for it.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; It's called the tribulation period.
[1:03:02] So why I am preaching with the force
[1:03:05] that I'm preaching with is to keep you
[1:03:08] from going there.
[1:03:11] [applause]
[1:03:17] [applause]
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; Finally, my brethren, be strong in the
[1:03:21] Lord and in the power of his might. PUT
[1:03:25] ON THE WHOLE ARMOR THAT YOU MAY BE ABLE
[1:03:28] to stand
[1:03:29] AGAINST THE WS OF the devil. For we
[1:03:33] WRESTLE NOT AGAINST FLESH and blood, BUT
[1:03:36] AGAINST PRINCIPALITIES, AND AGAINST THE
[1:03:38] powers of the rulers of the darkness of
[1:03:40] this world, and against spiritual
[1:03:43] wickedness IN HIGH PLACES. WHEREFORE
[1:03:45] TAKE unto you the whole armor of God,
[1:03:48] that you may able to stand withstand in
[1:03:50] the evil day, and having done all to
[1:03:53] stand. Stand therefore, having your
[1:03:56] loins gird about with truth, having on
[1:03:59] the breastplate of righteousness, HAVING
[1:04:01] YOUR FEET SHOT WITH THE PREPARATION OF
[1:04:03] THE GOSPEL OF PEACE, AND ABOVE ALL TAKEN
[1:04:06] THE SHIELD OF FAITH.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; WHEREWITH YOU SHALL BE ABLE TO QUENCH
[1:04:12] ALL THE FIERY DARTS OF THE WICKED.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND TAKE THE HELMET OF
[1:04:20] SALVATION AND THE SWORD OF THE SPIRIT
[1:04:23] WHICH IS THE WORD OF GOD. NOW THIS IS
[1:04:25] THE MOST POWERFUL PRAYING ALWAYS
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; WITH ALL PRAYER AND SUPPLICATION IN THE
[1:04:32] SPIRIT. AMEN.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; Hebrews 4 and verse 12. For the word of
[1:04:38] God is quick AND POWERFUL AND SHARPER
[1:04:42] THAN ANY TWO-EDGED SWORD, piercing even
[1:04:45] the dividing the asunderer of the soul
[1:04:48] and the spirit and the joints and the
[1:04:50] moral and the discerner of the thoughts.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; And the intents of the heart.
[1:05:00] SO THE WORD OF GOD KEEPS US CLEAN.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; I WANT A GOSPEL THAT WON'T JUST MAMBY
[1:05:07] PAMBY me around.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; I WANT A GOSPEL THAT'LL KEEP ME CLEAN,
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; KEEP US PURE.
[1:05:18] [applause]
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; Luke 10 AND VERSE 19. BEHOLD, I GIVE
[1:05:23] UNTO YOU POWER TO TREAD UPON SERPENTS.
[1:05:28] I GIVE YOU POWER TO TREAD UPON serpents
[1:05:33] and scorpions AND OVER THE POWER OF THE
[1:05:37] ENEMY.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; NOT PLAY WITH THEM. TREAD ON THEM.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; Stomp on them.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; KEEP SATAN UNDER YOUR FEET.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; It's here. I done put it down twice.
[1:05:57] It's good for us. Mark chapter 16. AND
[1:06:00] THESE SIGNS SHALL FOLLOW THEM THAT
[1:06:03] BELIEVE.
[1:06:04] In my name,
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; shall they cast out devils.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In my name.
[1:06:15] Oh, Brother Ron, but I'm having such A
[1:06:17] HARD TIME. CAST HIM OUT.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; STOP AND CAST HIM OUT.
[1:06:26] I'M NOT PUTTING UP WITH YOU TODAY.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; TAKE THE WORD OF GOD. TAKE IT ACROSS
[1:06:33] YOUR SUPERNATURAL LIPS AND SPEAK to the
[1:06:36] devil.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, THAT'S KIND OF TALKING TO
[1:06:40] YOURSELF. LET ME JUST SAY THE MOST
[1:06:42] POWERFUL THING THAT YOU DO EVERY DAY IS
[1:06:44] PRAY.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; We have the authority to to create an
[1:06:51] atmosphere in our home. RIGHT.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; OUR HOME SHOULD NOT BE A PLACE WHERE WE
[1:06:56] FIGHT AND FUSS AND FUME.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; It shouldn't BE STICKERS AND WALKING ON
[1:07:03] EGGSHELLS ALL THE TIME. IT SHOULD BE A
[1:07:06] PLACE OF LOVE. IT SHOULD BE A PLACE OF
[1:07:08] POWER. IT SHOULD BE A SANCTUARY. COME
[1:07:11] ON, HELP ME PREACH TODAY. [applause]
[1:07:18] [cheering]
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; YOU MAY NEED TO FALL IN LOVE AGAIN. LET
[1:07:22] ME JUST SAY START TODAY.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; Psalms chapter 27 and verse one. Very
[1:07:33] familiar. The Lord is my light and my
[1:07:35] salvation.
[1:07:36] Who shall I fear?
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; That last words is real powerful.
[1:07:48] The scripture mentions fear 600 times.
[1:07:53] So, Satan operates with fear.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; The Lord is my light and my salvation.
[1:08:03] Whom
[1:08:05] whom
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; whom
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; come on
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; shall I fear?
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; I'll give you an example.
[1:08:15] Doctors when they begin to give you
[1:08:18] difficult news, I find it is amazing
[1:08:23] that people will come to a spot
[1:08:27] and cancer is mentioned.
[1:08:30] A lot of times it's just part of a
[1:08:32] sentence.
[1:08:34] Really don't have cancer, but there's
[1:08:37] it's a it's leading up to it and we're
[1:08:39] going to try to stop it.
[1:08:42] And people become so consumed
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; right
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; with the fear of cancer.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; LET ME JUST SAY THIS TO YOU. CANCER IS
[1:08:55] NOT GREATER THAN GOD.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; Cancer is not greater than God.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; I DON'T WAKE UP EVERY MORNING AND TAKE
[1:09:04] MY CHEMO and fear THE CANCER THAT I
[1:09:07] FIGHT FOR these almost six years now. I
[1:09:10] DON'T FEAR IT.
[1:09:13] ARE YOU WITH ME? IF YOU FEAR IT
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; AND YOU DREAD IT, IT'LL WHIP YOU.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; IT'LL WHIP YOU.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; IT'S A DEMON THAT LIVES OFF OF YOUR GOOD
[1:09:25] LIFE.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; Are you WITH ME NOW? YOU DON'T HAVE TO
[1:09:30] FEAR THESE THINGS.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, WE'RE CHILDREN OF GOD.
[1:09:34] [screaming]
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; SOMEBODY OUGHT TO HELP ME PREACH right
[1:09:36] here. WE'RE CHILDREN OF GOD. WE DON'T
[1:09:41] HAVE TO FEAR THE DEVIL.
[1:09:44] [applause]
[1:09:49] [applause]
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; The Lord is the strength of my life.
[1:09:55] OF WHOM SHALL I BE AFRAID?
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; When the wicked, even mine enemies and
[1:10:00] my foes came upon me to eat up my flesh,
[1:10:02] they stumbled and fell. Though a host
[1:10:05] should ENCAMP AGAINST ME, MY heart shall
[1:10:08] not fail. Though war should rise against
[1:10:11] me, IN THIS WILL I BE CONFIDENT.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; GOD'S NOT TALKING ABOUT A picnic in any
[1:10:17] of these scriptures.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; I'll be laying ON A HAMMOCK. NO, HE'S
[1:10:22] NOT TALK ABOUT HAMMOCK LAYING.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; I'm going to be LAYING UNDER THE
[1:10:27] SUNSHINE and the breeze is GOING TO BE
[1:10:29] BLOWING. NO, [screaming] YOU'RE AT WAR.
[1:10:32] [cheering]
[1:10:34] That's right,
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; BOY. BROTHER RON, BACK IN THE GOOD OLD
[1:10:37] DAYS, YOU KNOW, WE USED TO HAVE A LIFE
[1:10:40] OF A PARTY. LET ME JUST SAY IT.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; LET'S CUT IT UP ONE FUR OF THOSE WERE
[1:10:46] NOT YOUR GOOD OLD DAYS.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; You were on YOUR WAY TO HELL.
[1:10:52] [cheering]
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; THOSE WERE NOT YOUR TRUE FRIENDS.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; I MISS IT. SO BAD. IT'S BECAUSE YOUR
[1:11:05] HEART IS IN the wrong place.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; I'm not feeding MY MIND ON THE GOOD OLD
[1:11:12] DAYS.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; Drinking was destroying your liver.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; Drugs was destroying your pancreas and
[1:11:20] your brain cells. DON'T TELL ME THE
[1:11:22] DEVIL IS A HARD SLAVE MASTER.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:11:34] I find it amazing that we did all of
[1:11:36] that in our life.
[1:11:39] We spent all of that money on that
[1:11:41] nonsense
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; and then when we come to church
[1:11:52] [applause]
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; we fought in the world. We did all kind
[1:12:03] of nonsense in the world and then we
[1:12:05] become mice.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; WE BECOME A MOUSE. I'LL SAY IT. A MOUSE
[1:12:11] SITTING IN A IN A CHAIR. He didn't even
[1:12:15] SHAKE MY HEAD. GET OVER IT.
[1:12:18] [screaming]
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; I GOT MY FEELINGS HURT. COME ON.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; COME ON. YOU'RE BIGGER THAN THAT.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, that's bigger than what you
[1:12:42] think it was.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; It's bigger than what you think it is.
[1:12:45] Cuz the devil will get in your mind.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; The devil will get in your mind and go,
[1:12:49] "Those people don't love you." WHEN THEY
[1:12:52] LOVE YOU MORE THAN WHAT THEM FRIENDS OUT
[1:12:54] THERE DID.
[1:12:56] [applause]
[1:13:01] These people are GOING TO SPEND ETERNITY
[1:13:03] WITH YOU. [applause]
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; [sighs and gasps]
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; Brother Rond, you know what that guy
[1:13:19] over there did and that guy over there
[1:13:21] did and that guy over there. Listen, if
[1:13:23] the blood of Jesus Christ is applied,
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; it's gone.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; It's gone. And that part of the book is
[1:13:33] taken away.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; You'll enjoy next week. I'm going to
[1:13:40] speak on In spite of your flaw.
[1:13:46] Let me let me just give you a little
[1:13:48] little taste of it.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; I wish I had a
[1:13:56] Well, let me give you a taste.
[1:14:01] It would be a bad day if somebody said
[1:14:04] something against Brother Homer Frasier.
[1:14:06] Now,
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; I I want y'all to know IT'D BE A BAD
[1:14:12] DAY.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; It'd be a BAD DAY.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW IF YOU WOULD SAY
[1:14:22] SOMETHING ABOUT HIM, you're only kicking
[1:14:25] a dead man.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; And he's in heaven.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; And he could care less what you say.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Shannon, would you stand up
[1:14:48] a minute?
[1:14:52] Now, I want you to turn around. I want
[1:14:54] you to look at this audience. NOW, I
[1:14:55] WANT YOU TO IMAGINE here just for a
[1:14:57] minute
[1:14:59] that there's a picture frame around him.
[1:15:03] Are you with me?
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; There's a picture frame around him.
[1:15:10] And you know what? You start picking on
[1:15:12] him
[1:15:14] and start bringing up his past and
[1:15:16] bringing up the nonsense in his life.
[1:15:20] YOU'RE KICKING A DEAD MAN.
[1:15:24] [cheering and applause]
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; You are wasting your time.
[1:15:37] [applause and cheering]
[1:15:57] You're going to like it.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; But I knew you needed this today.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Where'd you get that,
[1:16:06] brother? When I was preaching the
[1:16:08] memorial for brother brother Bisll,
[1:16:12] I got that sermon.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, I wish he wouldn't go nowhere, but I
[1:16:17] get those sermons like that and you
[1:16:18] could like it.
[1:16:22] [snorts]
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; Though a host should encamp against me,
[1:16:27] my heart shall not fear.
[1:16:29] Though war should rise AGAINST ME, IN
[1:16:32] THIS WILL I BE CONFIDENT. WHEN I AM at
[1:16:35] war, I realize I'm a child of God.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; One thing that I have desired of the
[1:16:43] Lord that will I seek after, that I may
[1:16:45] dwell in the house OF THE LORD ALL THE
[1:16:48] DAYS OF MY LIFE, to behold the beauty of
[1:16:51] the Lord, AND TO INQUIRE IN HIS TEMPLE.
[1:16:53] NOTICE THESE NEXT WORDS. FOR IN THE TIME
[1:16:55] OF TROUBLE,
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; for in the TIME OF TROUBLE, HE SHALL
[1:17:01] HIDE ME IN HIS PAVILION. IN THE SECRET
[1:17:03] OF HIS TABERNACLE SHALL HE HIDE ME, AND
[1:17:05] HE SHALL SET me upon a rock, AND NOW
[1:17:08] SHALL my head be lifted up above my
[1:17:10] enemies roundabout. Therefore will I
[1:17:13] OFFER IN HIS TABERNACLE SACRIFICES OF
[1:17:16] JOY.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; NOTICE THESE WORDS. I WILL SING.
[1:17:21] [cheering]
[1:17:22] [applause]
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; YAY. I WILL SING PRAISES UNTO
[1:17:26] [screaming] THE LORD,
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; brother Ron. But I don't like it. SO
[1:17:32] NOISY DOG GOING TO HEAVEN.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; But don't go to hell either
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; cuz there's going to be weeping and
[1:17:48] whailing and nashing OF TEETH.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; EVERYBODY'S GOING TO BE NAKED.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; You like nakedness here, you'll like
[1:17:58] nakedness in hell.
[1:18:00] But I got news for you, baby. Ain't
[1:18:02] everybody looking like they're at
[1:18:04] Hollywood?
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; Just give them baby dolls. They're about
[1:18:12] 10, 20 years. They don't look like that
[1:18:14] either.
[1:18:19] Naked in hell.
[1:18:23] I was preaching a convention
[1:18:25] and the preacher in front of me preached
[1:18:27] that sermon. naked in hell.
[1:18:32] I think everybody, including the mayor
[1:18:34] of the city, wanted to get saved after
[1:18:35] he preached that.
[1:18:39] I even thought about getting saved all
[1:18:41] over again.
[1:18:44] Listen, hell ain't a place you want to
[1:18:45] go.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; I want to tell you, I'm doing my very
[1:18:48] best to kind of keep you out of it.
[1:18:53] [applause]
[1:19:09] God at the beginning.
[1:19:12] At the beginning, God doesn't evolve. I
[1:19:16] want you to understand God is infinite.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; God don't change his mind.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; God don't change his mind.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; Right. He is infinite.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; He knows all things. He never has a new
[1:19:30] thought.
[1:19:32] So God don't do like man does. Man
[1:19:35] fought with rocks, then he thought with
[1:19:36] knives, then he thought with thought
[1:19:38] made a gun, bow and arrows. And he and
[1:19:40] he and you know the one that's got the
[1:19:42] best weapon has the has the most power.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; So God didn't do that. Notice this
[1:19:48] quote. God at the beginning gave his
[1:19:50] children the atomic weapon.
[1:19:55] BECAUSE HE'S THE INFINITE GOD. NOW,
[1:19:59] seeing there was going to be conflict
[1:20:02] and there was going to be a battle, GOD
[1:20:04] EQUIPPED HIS CHILDREN with the right
[1:20:06] kind of ammunition right down of the
[1:20:08] right kind of attack, the right kind of
[1:20:10] everything that they had need of.
[1:20:14] That would SWEEP THEM ALL THE WAY from
[1:20:16] Eden TO THE RAPTURE.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS IT? THE WORD. AMEN.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; THE word it'll defeat Satan
[1:20:27] anywhere,
[1:20:28] any place.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; ANOTHER PLACE HE SAYS ANYWHERE, ANY
[1:20:34] PLACE, under any condition.
[1:20:40] Now, why do we want to substitute
[1:20:43] anything else
[1:20:47] when we've already got the best?
[1:20:52] [snorts] Satan can't defeat the word,
[1:20:56] but he can defeat how you think about
[1:20:58] the word.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; He can't defeat the church.
[1:21:04] Well, he will bring you things that will
[1:21:06] try to defeat how you think about the
[1:21:10] church.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; Come on, buddy. Come on.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; Is it important to go to church? Before
[1:21:16] long, you'll start missing.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; Come on, buddy.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; And when you get start missing,
[1:21:24] you'll start getting weak.
[1:21:27] And then the devil can tell you any lie
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; any lie
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; that you can possibly get. Are you with
[1:21:36] me now?
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; Listen. He's the devil. HE DIDN'T START
[1:21:38] YESTERDAY.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; HE STARTED IN HEAVEN. HE'S STILL AT WAR
[1:21:42] RIGHT NOW. AND HE'LL STAY AT WAR.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; NOW, 1 Corinthians chapter 15 and verse
[1:21:50] 58. Therefore, my beloved brethren, be
[1:21:54] you steadfast. That's right.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; Unmovable,
[1:22:01] always abounding in the work of the
[1:22:03] Lord.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; For as much as you know that your labor
[1:22:08] is not in vain.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; Whether you're the the the
[1:22:16] first hour worker or the last hour
[1:22:18] worker.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; Come on, buddy.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Every person IN THIS
[1:22:24] BUILDING SHOULD STRIVE TO BE A PILLAR,
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; a pillar in the church,
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; A PILLAR IN THE CHURCH. BUT BEFORE YOU
[1:22:37] CAN BE A PILLAR IN THE CHURCH, BE A
[1:22:39] PILLAR IN YOUR FAMILY.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; UNSHAKABLE, [screaming] UNMOVABLE.
[1:22:57] Men of God who believe God and know what
[1:23:02] God has promised is not afraid. That's
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD WILL STICK WITH his word.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; JUST AS CERTAIN AS HE IS GOD.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; LET ME JUST SAY THIS. YOU DON'T HAVE TO
[1:23:15] SAY THAT the Calvary is coming. It's
[1:23:17] already here.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:19] [applause] Amen.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to behave.
[1:23:23] I'm trying to behave.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; He says, "Now watch what he did when he
[1:23:30] was on earth. He conquered
[1:23:33] and possessed every gate that the enemy
[1:23:35] had."
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; THE ROYAL SEED. HE PROMISED IT BY THE
[1:23:39] WORD. HE CONQUERED IT. HE CONQUERED THE
[1:23:42] GATE OF SICKNESS.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; Thank God HE DID. HE CONQUERED THE GATE
[1:23:48] OF SICKNESS FOR US. THAT'S WHAT HE COME
[1:23:51] TO DO. REMEMBER SICK PEOPLE, HE
[1:23:54] CONQUERED THAT GATE.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; An amen for brother Ron.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You don't HAVE TO CONQUER
[1:24:03] IT. IT'S ALREADY CONQUERED. OTHER men
[1:24:06] had to conquer their OWN GATE, BUT YOU
[1:24:08] DON'T HAVE to conquer IT. IT'S ALREADY
[1:24:10] CONQUERED. HE CONQUERED THE GATE OF
[1:24:12] SICKNESS.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; And what did he do when he conquered the
[1:24:16] gate of sickness? saying that he WOULD
[1:24:18] DO WHATEVER YOU SHALL ASK ON EARTH SHALL
[1:24:21] HE AND WHATSOEVER YOU'LL BOUND ON EARTH
[1:24:23] YOU'LL HE'LL BIND IN HEAVEN and he'll
[1:24:26] give the keys of the gate HE CONQUERED
[1:24:29] THE GATE OF temptation
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; this IS A BIGGIE BY THE WORD AND THE
[1:24:36] KEYS WAS RESIST THE ENEMY
[1:24:42] [snorts]
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; RESIST THE ENEMY
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; AMEN AMEN.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; And he WILL FLEE FROM YOU.
[1:24:57] [applause]
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; Brother Andrew talked about her last
[1:25:08] night, but that little 5 foot2
[1:25:11] blindheaded lady over there,
[1:25:15] when she WANTED TO GET A POINT ACROSS,
[1:25:19] SHE'D SAY, "I'VE HAD ENOUGH." AND SHE'D
[1:25:22] STOMP THAT RIGHT FOOT.
[1:25:32] Did it work for you? Hey, I ain't no
[1:25:34] dummy.
[1:25:37] We're not dumb people here.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; But David, we've learned to live here.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; There's a time to fight.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; Come on, help me preach now. Don't you
[1:25:48] want me to look like a wimp now? GET
[1:25:50] WITH ME. THERE'S A TIME TO FIGHT AND
[1:25:53] THERE'S A TIME TO LOVE.
[1:25:56] [applause]
[1:25:58] WOO.
[1:26:02] [applause]
[1:26:04] AND IT'S ALWAYS A TIME TO HUG.
[1:26:08] Tell your wife you love her right now.
[1:26:13] Brother Ron, this is a worship place.
[1:26:15] That's a good start place to start right
[1:26:17] there. That's a good place.
[1:26:26] Ain't that right, Jay?
[1:26:36] Every time I look that way, it's a grin
[1:26:37] about that about the W.
[1:26:42] He's heard about it for years and now he
[1:26:44] knows what we're talking about.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; You also going to know about that foot.
[1:26:50] [applause]
[1:26:58] Now, LET'S MAKE THAT SPIRITUAL. WE ARE
[1:27:00] THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; WE ARE THE QUEEN OF HEAVEN. [laughter]
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; EVERYTHING THAT HE OWNS, BROTHER DOUG,
[1:27:10] WE OWN.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; EVERY POWER THAT HE HAS, WE HAVE.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; DON'T BE A SECURITY CAP. THIS AIN'T THE
[1:27:20] SPOT. COME ON. [screaming]
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; STOP YOUR FOOT.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; Go ahead and stop it right there.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; He conquered death. He conquered hell.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; He conquered death and hell. He
[1:27:37] conquered what others couldn't conquer
[1:27:43] because they're of THE NATURAL SEED. BUT
[1:27:45] THIS IS A spiritual seed. He conquered
[1:27:48] the gate of the grave.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. and rose up on the third day for
[1:27:52] our justification. Now we are more than
[1:27:55] conquerors.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; We have a right into it as our
[1:28:00] inheritance. MORE THAN CONQUEROR. SAY IT
[1:28:03] WITH ME.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; More than conqueror.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; NOW WE'RE DEALING WITH A DEFEATED ENEMY.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; The enemy that you fight
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; IS DEFEATED.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[1:28:21] [applause]
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HE'S DEFEATED.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; COME ON.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to behave now. We're more
[1:28:36] THAN CONQUERORS.
[1:28:38] DEALING WITH A DEFEATED ENEMY. SICKNESS
[1:28:41] IS DEFEATED.
[1:28:43] [snorts]
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; DEATH IS DEFEATED. HELL IS DEFEATED.
[1:28:46] That's right.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; Everything is defeated.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; Watch what he brother says. Oh my wish
[1:28:52] that I WAS TWICE MY SIZE.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; And now maybe I feel about twice as
[1:28:58] good. WE ARE DISPUTING WITH A DEFEATED
[1:29:02] ENEMY.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; Let me go through the great quote book
[1:29:08] for just a little bit. I can do all
[1:29:10] things
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; through Christ that strengthens me.
[1:29:13] AMEN.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; HE GIVETH POWER TO THE FAINT, AND TO
[1:29:16] THEM THAT HAVE NO MIGHT, he increasth
[1:29:18] strength.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; OH MAN. THEREFORE, I I TAKE PLEASURE in
[1:29:22] infirmities and reproaches, IN
[1:29:24] NECESSITIES, AND PERSECUTIONS, IN
[1:29:26] DISTRESSES FOR CHRIST'S SAKE. FOR WHEN I
[1:29:29] AM WEAK, THEN I am strong.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; You heard it last night. When you FEEL
[1:29:34] LIKE GIVING UP, DON'T WORRY.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; HE'S GOT A HOLD OF YOU,
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; brother Ron. that I've come to the END
[1:29:43] OF MY ROPE. PIE NOT HANG [screaming] ON.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; YOU THINK YOU'RE THE ONE HANGING ON?
[1:29:53] FORGET IT. YOU DON'T HAVE THE STRENGTH
[1:29:55] TO HANG ON. IT'S GOD [screaming] THAT'S
[1:29:57] GOT A HOLD OF YOU, NOT YOU GOT A HOLD OF
[1:30:00] GOD. IT'S GOD [screaming] THAT'S GOT A
[1:30:02] HOLD OF YOU. [applause]
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I just feel like giving up.
[1:30:09] Go ahead.
[1:30:13] Oh, that's horrible, brother. That's
[1:30:15] horrible. Go ahead.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; IF YOU'RE A SEED OF GOD, YOU CAN'T GIVE
[1:30:19] UP.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T QUIT. YOU CAN'T RUN.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; IF YOU'RE A SEED OF GOD,
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; EVERY time you quit,
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; COME ON. SOMETHING OUTSIDE OF YOU KEEPS
[1:30:33] PUSHING YOU.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; I'M NOT DRIVEN BY MY ENERGY. I'M DRIVEN
[1:30:39] BY AN ARTISIAN WELL THAT'S ON THE INSIDE
[1:30:41] of me.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; Greater is he that is in you.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; THAN HE THAT IS in the world.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; IT IS NOT THE SIZE OF THE DOG THAT'S IN
[1:30:57] THE FIGHT.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; COME ON NOW. IT IS THE SIZE OF THE FIGHT
[1:31:02] THAT'S IN THE [screaming] DOG.
[1:31:05] [applause]
[1:31:11] SAY IT WITH ME. IT IS NOT THE SIZE OF
[1:31:14] THE DOG THAT'S IN THE FIGHT. IT IS THE
[1:31:17] SIZE OF THE FIGHT THAT'S IN THE DOG.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; GO AHEAD AND SCREAM BOOT.
[1:31:25] [applause]
[1:31:34] For God has not given us a spirit of
[1:31:36] fear,
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; BUT OF POWER
[1:31:41] AND OF love and of a sound mind.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; I will love thee, oh Lord, my strength.
[1:31:52] The Lord is my rock and my strength. He
[1:31:57] is WHOM I TRUST, MY BAKLA, the horn of
[1:32:01] my salvation and my power.
[1:32:06] You've heard it before. Listen again.
[1:32:08] Isaiah 40 and verse 29. HE GIVETH POWER
[1:32:12] TO THE FAINT.
[1:32:19] HE GIVETH POWER TO THE FAINT.
[1:32:24] AND TO THEM THAT HAVE NO MIGHT, HE
[1:32:25] INCREASTH STRENGTH. EVEN THE YOUTH SHALL
[1:32:29] FAINT AND BE WEARY, AND THE YOUNG men
[1:32:31] shall utterly fall. Notice his next
[1:32:34] words. But they that wait upon the Lord.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; Shall renew their strength,
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; THEY SHALL MOUNT UP ON WINGS AS AN
[1:32:44] EAGLE. They shall run and not be weary.
[1:32:47] THEY SHALL WALK AND not faint.
[1:32:54] You ever been in a real fight?
[1:32:57] I'm not talking about a handshaking
[1:32:59] contest, but a real fight.
[1:33:09] A real fight.
[1:33:12] Let me just say,
[1:33:14] when you in a real fight, you ain't
[1:33:17] worried about rules.
[1:33:20] That's right. That's right.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; You ain't worried about rules.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; You going to fight with all your might.
[1:33:28] As a matter of fact, a real fight, you
[1:33:30] don't know whether you're going to live
[1:33:31] through it or not.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; But if you want to go home to see your
[1:33:36] wife, you got to fight.
[1:33:45] I woke up
[1:33:48] after almost a month
[1:33:51] looking at a glass with my wife standing
[1:33:54] on the other side of the glass.
[1:33:58] I know what fight's about.
[1:34:01] If there's any preacher that knows what
[1:34:03] fight's about, I know what fight's
[1:34:05] about. Right?
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; For somebody got to fight cancer,
[1:34:14] God give me strength.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; I'll fight it.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; But I can't do it on my own.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; I can't do it on my own.
[1:34:26] Sister Wanda has listened to me preach
[1:34:28] over these last five years. Now she
[1:34:30] knows the fight.
[1:34:35] She knows the fight and it's real.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; Sister Wanda, you raise your hand right
[1:34:41] there. She knows this baby's real.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; She got a dog that she loves. She's got
[1:34:49] a man sitting beside of her that she
[1:34:50] loves. She got family around her that
[1:34:52] she loves. But she's got to fight that
[1:34:54] enemy,
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; Cuz that enemy wants to take her life,
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; BAD NEWS.
[1:35:02] HE PICKED THE WRONG ONE. [screaming]
[1:35:05] [applause]
[1:35:14] [applause]
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; I PICKED HER. BUT WHAT ABOUT YOU?
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; YOU HEAR THESE SERMONS FOR YEARS AND ONE
[1:35:20] DAY IT COMES YOUR TURN.

[1:35:31] WORTH FIGHTING FOR.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO FIGHT FOR YOUR OWN SANITY.
[1:35:35] IT'S WORTH FIGHTING FOR.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, "I'm so glad that
[1:35:52] a man can so completely serve God
[1:35:56] until the devil
[1:35:59] don't know what to do with him.
[1:36:10] I'm so glad that a man can so completely
[1:36:14] serve God until the devil don't know
[1:36:18] what to do with him.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; Is that just a quote?
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; Are you ready to live it?
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; I shared this with the brothers. We're
[1:36:43] at the point now where this message is
[1:36:46] truth that will take us into a rapture.
[1:36:50] I want you to understand, moms and dads,
[1:36:53] this message and these quotes has put us
[1:36:55] into a rapture condition.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; We can't stay here.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; If you look at the news, me and you
[1:37:03] can't stay here.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; We can't stay here. I don't care what
[1:37:09] party you vote in on Tuesday. I don't
[1:37:11] care. They're all rotten.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; They're all rotten. Get it? Get it in
[1:37:17] your mind. They're all rotten. America
[1:37:20] is not the America of 120 years ago. It
[1:37:23] ain't that America no more.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; We're
[1:37:28] on ahead.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, but brother, I'm worried about my
[1:37:32] food. Don't you worry. God will be your
[1:37:34] provider.
[1:37:37] [applause]
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; Let me just say this. You worried about
[1:37:46] who's going to put food on your table.
[1:37:48] Let me say God's going to do that.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; Let let me let me just share this with
[1:37:56] you. We're going to a kingdom
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; and be real clear with you where we're
[1:38:03] not going to vote presidents.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; We've already got a king.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; Let me explain something to you about
[1:38:14] that place. There's not going to be a
[1:38:16] hospital.
[1:38:18] There's not going to be a doctor
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; that's needed.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; There's not going to be a lawyer needed.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; That's right, Sydney Katy. You can be in
[1:38:31] heaven and not have to work.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; WE WON'T NEED A POLICE FORCE.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; THANK EVERYONE for our police force.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; WE'RE GOING TO BE GUARDED BY THE ANGELS
[1:38:43] OF HEAVEN.
[1:38:47] WE NOT EVEN GOING TO HAVE A TIMEX, BABY.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; He's been 55 minutes.
[1:38:56] And that is what I've been 55 minutes.
[1:38:59] But I'm getting ready to close.
[1:39:02] There's not going to be one of these.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; You don't have to worry about your
[1:39:07] dinner in heaven. God's going to provide
[1:39:08] it for you.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; This is what I love. There's not going
[1:39:14] to be a right in heaven.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; Not one.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; There's not going to be one sinner in
[1:39:20] heaven.
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; There's not going to be a lie.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; There's not going to be a drunk.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; Not going to be a pervert.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; I'm all right. I'm all right. Don't you
[1:39:36] worry.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; Ain't going to be one of them there.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; SODOM AND GOMORRAH IS NOT GOING TO BE
[1:39:41] THERE.
[1:39:43] Thank you. [applause]
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THIS WORLD'S NOT MY HOME.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; I'm only a temporary being here.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; I'M FIGHTING TO GO THERE.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; I'M FIGHTING TO GO THERE.
[1:40:11] I have fought for my children here. I
[1:40:14] have fought for my grandchildren here. I
[1:40:16] HAVE FOUGHT FOR THIS CHURCH HERE.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; LET ME JUST SAY I FIGHT FOR YOU.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; I FIGHT ON MY KNEES FOR YOU. I CALL YOUR
[1:40:28] NAME before God.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; FOR YOU.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; I JUST DON'T PREACH FOR YOU. I FIGHT FOR
[1:40:37] YOU.
[1:40:42] I walk
[1:40:45] into a sick person's room yesterday and
[1:40:48] I said, "You're sick, aren't you?"
[1:40:50] Well, yeah. I said, "I see it." How you
[1:40:53] know? I said, "I see it on you. You're
[1:40:56] sick." And I come to pray for you.
[1:41:02] When I preach, I can tell if the sheep
[1:41:06] are in a battle and there's sickness on
[1:41:09] them.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; They got weak. They ain't eating right.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; Sometimes sheep get sores on them.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; And sheep like to fit sheep and they'll
[1:41:22] start licking that sore place and then
[1:41:25] they'll get sick.
[1:41:30] How many was around here when brother
[1:41:32] Homer preached that sermon?
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; Come on. You've been around here a long
[1:41:37] time, some of you. Brother Homer
[1:41:39] preached sermon like
[1:41:42] sheep are dumb.
[1:41:44] How many remember that one?
[1:41:47] [panting]
[1:41:48] For those that don't know, brother Homer
[1:41:49] was a founding pastor here. And listen,
[1:41:52] he was a fighter.
[1:41:56] And he taught us, I went to New Zealand
[1:41:59] and learned it, too.
[1:42:01] He taught us when sheep get sick, they
[1:42:04] get sores on them.
[1:42:07] Little home was a farmer. And he said
[1:42:10] they get sick and they get a sore on
[1:42:12] them. And then another sheep will say,
[1:42:14] "I'll fix it for them."
[1:42:17] Instead of letting the shepherd fix it,
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; THEY GO LICKING ON THE son
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; and then they get sick.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm going to fix my husband. Don't
[1:42:39] worry, baby. You can't fix yourself.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; I'm going to fix my wife. I done told
[1:42:47] you you can't fix yourself.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; I'm gonna go on a diet like everybody
[1:42:53] else. Well, I try.
[1:42:55] You're the one putting the FORK IN YOUR
[1:42:57] MOUTH. DON'T BLAME YOUR DOCTOR. NOW, I
[1:43:00] DIDN'T POINT AT YOU. I pointed.
[1:43:05] Everybody get so sensitive. He talking
[1:43:07] about my weight.
[1:43:12] [panting]
[1:43:13] I could lose if I had a shot. Well, get
[1:43:16] yourself a shot.
[1:43:21] Come walk with me three miles every day.
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; That'll help you, baby. You better get
[1:43:25] good shoes.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; Sick.
[1:43:33] Sickness is being part of the battle.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; It's part of the battle. Brother Ron, I
[1:43:39] wish you'd have quit just a few minutes
[1:43:40] ago. No, I'm where I need to be right
[1:43:42] now.
[1:43:44] That's why you need to be in church.
[1:43:47] [applause]
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; Cuz a pastor will see the sore that you
[1:43:55] got and he'll put a little saff on that
[1:43:57] for you.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; Now, the saff will heal you
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; and he'll give you a shot of the word OF
[1:44:04] GOD.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; IT'LL HELP YOU. And then he's GOT TO GO
[1:44:07] FIX THE ONE THAT'S GOT A BELLY ache from
[1:44:11] licking on your soul.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; Good. Come on.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; Did that make any sense?
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah, it did. Thank you, brother Ron.
[1:44:22] Brother Ron, I appreciate that.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; One more quote. Musicians come
[1:44:28] so I'm not a liar.
[1:44:34] When the weakest of Christians,
[1:44:41] weakest of Christians
[1:44:43] go on their knees.
[1:44:48] Everybody with me? Weakest of Christians
[1:44:51] go on their knees,
[1:44:54] the kingdom of God shakes. The kingdom
[1:44:58] of hell shakes.
[1:45:02] Let me explain something to you for we
[1:45:04] got a lot of new ones here.
[1:45:11] Brother Meadows is probably one of the
[1:45:13] oldest people in this building.
[1:45:18] Brother Meadows has been a warrior.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; He was a warrior in the military. He was
[1:45:25] a fighter during the war.
[1:45:28] He's been a warrior and and the results
[1:45:30] of that is his family is sprinkled all
[1:45:32] over this church.
[1:45:34] [snorts]
[1:45:35] One of his grandsons is my son-in-law.
[1:45:41] Brother Meadows is now
[1:45:44] age is creeping on him.
[1:45:46] He told me the other day I called him. I
[1:45:50] said, "How you doing, young man?" He
[1:45:51] said, "You need to look in the mirror.
[1:45:53] You're not a young man no more.
[1:46:02] Ain't that the truth, brother Metis?
[1:46:07] What I find is amazing in this church,
[1:46:11] Brother Meadows is at the stage, and I
[1:46:13] think he's honest with us, he can't
[1:46:14] remember what he had for breakfast.
[1:46:19] He has to have others take care of him.
[1:46:21] There was a time that he beat the drum.
[1:46:24] incredible drum player,
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; incredible deacon in this church,
[1:46:28] incredible warrior.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; But he may not know your name or know
[1:46:34] who you are.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; All right. But as I preach,
[1:46:40] [applause]
[1:46:47] HE FINISHES QUOTES AND FINISHES
[1:46:49] SCRIPTURES
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE NAME OF THE LORD IS A STRONG
[1:46:53] TOWER AND THE RIGHTEOUS RUN INTO IT AND
[1:46:56] THEY ARE SAVED. [applause]
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; Give the Lord a great big hand this
[1:47:02] morning. [cheering]
[1:47:07] HALLELUJAH.
[1:47:08] [applause]
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [applause]
[1:47:21] When the Lord anoints a sermon,
[1:47:26] we know he's got a reason and he's got a
[1:47:28] purpose.
[1:47:34] I want to share one more thing to you.
[1:47:37] Brother Andrew was preaching last night.
[1:47:40] [snorts]
[1:47:43] Brother Andrew came to a certain spot
[1:47:45] last night and he said he started
[1:47:47] talking about rent
[1:47:50] and he was very he was trying
[1:47:53] to get us not to feel bad if we were
[1:47:56] renters.
[1:47:58] We've all done that.
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; We've all done that.
[1:48:01] But he wasn't talking about property.
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; He wasn't talking about property.
[1:48:09] He said, "But we don't want to be
[1:48:10] renters.
[1:48:12] We want to own it."
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; And he's TALKING ABOUT THE PROMISES OF
[1:48:16] THE word of God.
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; AND HE SAID, "WE DON'T want to rent
[1:48:21] forgiveness." Right.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN HE SAID THAT,
[1:48:31] I SAW THE PRESENCE OF GOD DROP ON this
[1:48:36] platform
[1:48:38] CUZ GOD WON'T DON'T WANT US TO BE
[1:48:40] CATHOLICS
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; WHERE WE [screaming] PAY FOR FORGIVENESS
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; AND GO TO SOME PRIEST AND ASK FOR
[1:48:49] FORGIVENESS OVER AND OVER AND OVER
[1:48:51] AGAIN. WHEN YOU ASK GOD FOR FORGIVENESS,
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; IT'S AS THOUGH YOU NEVER DID IT IN the
[1:49:01] first place.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; You own it.
[1:49:07] IT'S MINE. IT'S MINE. IT'S MINE. IT'S
[1:49:10] MINE. IT'S MINE.
[1:49:14] Turn to your neighbor and say, "It's
[1:49:15] mine. It's mine."
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Give the Lord [applause]
[1:49:22] another.
[1:49:36] Oh, the weapon may be formed, but it
[1:49:40] won't [music and singing] prosper.
[1:49:45] When the darkness falls, it won't
[1:49:48] prevail. Cuz
[1:49:51] [music]
[1:49:53] the God I serve knows only how to
[1:49:58] triump. [music and singing]
[1:50:01] Oh my God will never fail. [singing]

[1:51:12] down for many giants. [singing]

[1:52:38] You turn it for good.

[1:54:06] Jesus Christ, God's only son. He [music]
[1:54:10] fought the battle [singing] and he won.
[1:54:13] I will not be defeated anymore.

[1:55:04] power over sin, [music] I will not be
[1:55:08] defeated [singing]
[1:55:09] anymore.
[1:55:11] Lord. [music] Oh, I will not be

[1:55:34] be defeated anymore. [singing]
[1:55:39] Well, I was alone and idol and I was a
[1:55:43] sinner, too. And I heard a voice from
[1:55:46] heaven [music] saying, "There is
[1:55:48] [singing] work to do." So, I took my
[1:55:51] master's hand [music] and I joined that
[1:55:54] heavenly band. And I'm on the

[2:00:26] Hallelujah.
[2:00:28] Aren't you thankful to be serving in the
[2:00:30] Lord's army?
[2:00:32] Hallelujah. Why don't you turn around
[2:00:34] one more time? Shake one another's hand.
[2:00:38] Amen.
[2:00:41] Well, we got some weapons, don't we?
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. It's very good. It's very
[2:00:49] good to to take a look around through
[2:00:50] the armor case every once in a while and
[2:00:53] pull out the AK-47.
[2:00:55] Sometimes Sometimes you got to pull out
[2:00:57] the machete for the job.
[2:00:59] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you got to pull out that Colt
[2:01:00] 45. Sometimes you got to go in there and
[2:01:03] get something a little bit bigger and
[2:01:04] pull out the judge itself and get a 45
[2:01:06] and maybe 44 Magnum.
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; I tell you, I gave Katie my 44 Magnum
[2:01:11] one time. I let her shoot all the
[2:01:13] pistols that I had. And when I got to
[2:01:14] that 45 44 Magnum, she shot it one time.
[2:01:18] Said, "That's that's all I need right
[2:01:20] there. I don't need to shoot it no more.
[2:01:23] I know what it can do." Let me tell you,
[2:01:25] there's only a few times that I've had
[2:01:27] to pull out certain scriptures, but when
[2:01:29] I've had to pull them out, I know that
[2:01:31] they're more than capable.
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; I tell you, maybe maybe you need to pull
[2:01:35] out, maybe you pull it off your side
[2:01:37] right now, like an old western, LIKE OLD
[2:01:39] JESSE JAMES, AND PULL IT out and just
[2:01:41] let the devil know what you got on your
[2:01:43] side every once in a while.
[2:01:45] &gt;&gt; You ain't got to hide behind SOME VEST.
[2:01:48] YOU GOT THE ARMOR of the Holy Ghost upon
[2:01:50] you. [applause]
[2:01:54] Sometimes you got to get real close and
[2:01:56] personal to the devil.
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; Just go ahead and jerk that sword right
[2:01:59] on out there.
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; Slice that devil's head right off.
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; What are you talking about? That's ugly.
[2:02:07] Absolutely not. That's what I was born
[2:02:09] to do.
[2:02:11] &gt;&gt; I was born TO PRAISE IN SUCH A WAY THAT
[2:02:14] MY PRAISE WOULD CUT THE DEVIL'S HEAD
[2:02:16] OFF.
[2:02:17] &gt;&gt; Some of you WERE BORN TO PREACH. SOME OF
[2:02:19] YOU WERE BORN TO CLAP YOUR HANDS. SOME
[2:02:21] OF YOU WERE BORN TO BE MAMAS, but you
[2:02:23] have a weapon
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; that Satan cannot stop.
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; I told brother Matthew while brother Ron
[2:02:29] was preaching. I said, "Go look up that
[2:02:31] quote blast words." Brother Brandham
[2:02:33] says, "Go and turn them blast words on
[2:02:35] the devil." That atomic faith. He said,
[2:02:37] "You know what it is?" He said, "It's
[2:02:39] thus SAYITH THE LORD." THAT'S WHAT YOU
[2:02:41] GOT TO TURN LOOSE ON THE DEVIL is turn
[2:02:43] loose the word. PULL THAT THING OUT. GET
[2:02:46] YOUR SICK SHOOTER OUT AND GO AHEAD AND
[2:02:48] start
[2:02:49] peppering that devil.
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. I was the best cowboy in Pilot,
[2:02:55] Virginia when I was growing up. There
[2:02:57] wasn't nobody that could outgun me and
[2:02:59] Matthew Spencer. Raymond Reese even
[2:03:01] wrote a song about us. It was famous. I
[2:03:05] don't know if y'all ever heard it or
[2:03:06] not, but it was about the Spencer boys
[2:03:08] coming to town.
[2:03:10] probably went record. Probably broke the
[2:03:12] broke the internet. Went aluminum.
[2:03:15] Never hit platinum.
[2:03:18] But let me say this. I killed a whole
[2:03:20] lot of Indians in my imaginary world up
[2:03:23] there playing cowboys.
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; But I ain't playing imaginary up here.
[2:03:28] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron ain't just wasting your
[2:03:30] time. HE IS SLAYING GIANTS ONE AT A
[2:03:33] TIME, BRINGING HIS SHEEP BACK IN. WHY?
[2:03:36] BECAUSE HE'S A DAVID AND HE KNOWS HOW TO
[2:03:38] FIGHT GIANTS AND HE KNOWS HOW TO FEED
[2:03:40] SHEEP AT THE SAME TIME. THAT'S WHAT
[2:03:43] MAKES A POWERFUL PASTOR.
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; WOO! THIS AIN'T IMAGINARY. I DON'T KNOW
[2:03:48] IF YOU CAN SEE IT OR NOT, BUT IN THE
[2:03:49] SUPERNATURAL REALM, THERE'S GIANTS
[2:03:52] LAYING [screaming] ALL OVER THIS ROOM.
[2:03:54] WHY? BECAUSE SOMEBODY HAD THE FAITH TO
[2:03:56] RISE UP AND SAY, "YOU KNOW WHAT? I GOT
[2:03:58] THE SAME FAITH THAT DAVID'S GOT, AND I
[2:04:01] GOT THE SAME STONE THAT HE'S GOT. I GOT
[2:04:03] THE SAME SLING THAT HE'S GOT AND I GOT
[2:04:05] THE SAME GIANT OUT THERE IN FRONT OF ME.
[2:04:07] AND THAT GIANT'S GOT TO COME DOWN.
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; I feel like a preacher today. I feel
[2:04:15] like a son of God today.
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; IT AIN'T WHETHER I FEEL LIKE IT OR NOT.
[2:04:19] I STILL GOT THE SAME HOLY GHOST
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; THAT I FEEL RIGHT NOW
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; IN THIS PULL PIT. YOU'LL HAVE THAT
[2:04:27] TOMORROW MORNING WHEN YOU WAKE UP AND
[2:04:29] THE REST OF THESE PEOPLE AIN'T AROUND
[2:04:30] YOU. THAT SAME HOLY GHOST WILL BE RIGHT
[2:04:33] THERE IN THE CAR WITH YOU.
[2:04:36] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. God bless you, brother Ron.
[2:04:39] &gt;&gt; I'm a warrior.
[2:04:42] [applause]
[2:04:46] I was I was a part of a sales call this
[2:04:49] week and the guy that was leading this
[2:04:51] sales call he got to telling about how
[2:04:53] that he was he said when I was in the
[2:04:54] commerce world he said I was sitting
[2:04:56] there and he said he said I would tell
[2:04:58] my my my salesmen that were underneath
[2:05:00] of me said look it gets awkward
[2:05:02] sometimes when you're talking to people
[2:05:04] and don't know he said so practice in
[2:05:06] the mirror
[2:05:07] he said actually practice in the mirror
[2:05:09] that's what you need to do sometimes
[2:05:12] Just go ahead and practice in the mirror
[2:05:14] of God's word
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; and stand right there.
[2:05:18] I am a warrior.
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; I am a warrior.
[2:05:23] &gt;&gt; I like the way that looked when I SAID
[2:05:25] THAT. I AM A WARRIOR.
[2:05:29] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I AM A SERPENT BRUISER. I AM
[2:05:34] YOU KNOW WHAT? I LIKE THE WAY I'M
[2:05:35] TALKING. I AM A DEVIL DESTROYER. I AM
[2:05:39] MORE THAN A CONQUEROR. I AM VICTORIOUS
[2:05:42] THROUGH THE BLOOD OF J. I AM.
[2:05:45] [cheering and applause]
[2:05:45] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, "SAY IT until you
[2:05:48] believe it."
[2:05:49] &gt;&gt; And then WHEN YOU BELIEVE IT, EVERY
[2:05:51] DEVIL'S GOT TO MOVE out of its place.
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:05:56] &gt;&gt; Don't you love the Lord?
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; Don't you love this message?
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. [applause]
[2:06:02] Hallelujah.
[2:06:04] Let's sing. Blessed be the name of the
[2:06:06] Lord as we'll let the people be
[2:06:07] dismissed today. God bless you. We love
[2:06:09] you with the love of the Lord. Oh,
[2:06:11] blessed be the name of [music] the Lord.
[2:06:15] Oh, blessed be the name of [singing] the
[2:06:18] Lord.
[2:06:20] Blessed be the name of the Lord
[2:06:23] most [music]
[2:06:24] high.
[2:06:28] Oh, blessed [music] be the name of the
[2:06:31] Lord.
