I want [music] to thank each and every one of you for your prayers over this past week, two weeks for me and my back. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; I just thank the Lord for a doctor that would uh just come by my way and just be able to help me out. Uh excruciating pain I've never been in like that before.

To kind heavenly father, Lord, we just thank you [music] so much, oh God, for this wonderful and gracious opportunity, Lord, to speak to our heavenly father, our bridegroom, [music] our lord and savior, our everything, Lord, and our life, Lord. Everything we are, [music] Lord Jesus, is just because of you. Lord, we come and just humble ourselves before you in your presence. Lord, we want to thank you for all your goodness on our [music] lives and all your blessings, Lord, as we come to this season, Lord Jesus, of the year and the [music] the end of the year and facing a new year. Father, we just want to thank you for everything you've done for us [music] in this year, Lord. Your blessings that have just followed us, Lord. As as David [music] said, surely goodness and mercy will follow me all the days of our lives, Father. And I [music] believe we can all testify of that, Lord. Thank you for all your blessings, Lord, and all that you do for us. [music] How you protect us, how you provide, Lord. When we come against sickness, you heal us. When [music] we come against the trial, you make a way, Lord. You're your the never [music] failing presence of the Lord Jesus Christ is with his bride. And we just [music] thank you for that, Lord. We thank you, oh God, for coming down, Lord. And one day, humanity needed a redeemer, needed a savior. We were against an impossibility. An impossibility. There was no way that we within ourselves could get back to you. But Lord, even when there seemed to be an impossibility, Lord, you came, Lord, in a way that was just against ways of reasoning [music] that was an impossibility to man. But you came and you found a willing virgin, oh [music] God, to come and be born through. You made a way back and you were born a sinless, spotless lamb of God. Lord, that's where our faith is this morning, Lord. And you are the same yesterday, today, and forever. Lord, we appreciate your birth. And thank you for becoming [music] one of us. But thank you, Lord, that you didn't stay there. Thank you, Lord, that you didn't stay on the cross. Thank you, Lord, that you didn't stay in a tomb. Thank you, Lord, that you didn't even stay in heaven. But Father, you're [music] in each and every one, Father, that's been born again of the Holy Ghost. Lord, what a Christmas gift that you would give yourself to us, [music] oh God. That you'd be our comforter, Lord, in time of sorrow. You'd be everything we have need of. Truly, the greatest gift we could ever be given is the [music] presence of the Lord Jesus Christ. Father God, Lord, we just lift up all these requests to you, Lord. Many times Satan would have us just focus on [music] the problem and focus on the situation. But Lord, we want to shift our focus, Lord, on the answer. Lord, every request was serious and all the surgeries and the sicknesses and [music] all the situations of life. But Father, we want to confess that we believe and you are the answer to every request. [music] We lift them up to you even now in your presence and pray that you have mercy on the situations. We [music] thank you, Lord, for your goodness, Lord, to our pastor. Thank you, Lord, that you've brought him through another year. We just pray that you strengthen him, Lord, as he [music] speaks the word this morning. Lord, you know what he has need of in his body. Lord, you know, even more than the doctors do [music] exactly what he has need of. And Lord, you're more than able, Lord, and we just believe you. [music] We commit this service into your hands. Bless all the tithes and offerings. Bless the words as it comes for us. Forgive us of our sins. [music] And may we be more like you when we leave. In Jesus Christ's name we pray and ask these things. Amen. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. At this time, we're going to receive this this morning's offering you give as God's blessed you.

It's it's uh always a one of my favorite times of year. All the all the smells and all the good cooking. And Katie looked at me the other day. She said, "It's a good thing it ain't Christmas all year round." She said, "Cuz you'd be big as a hog." And that's probably true. I sure do enjoy all this good time and all the fixings and everything. And I want to appreciate all of the people here at Full Gospel Lighthouse for helping me get to look like a halfway hog here. So, I appreciate all the snacks and all the goodies and and every little gift card or God bless you. I I really do appreciate it and it means a lot. And if whether you give something or not, just to hear God bless you, that's that's enough for me. But we always take time and just give thanks for all the people here at Full Gospel Lighthouse. But I just just had it on my heart to I just wanted to appreciate our musicians here at Full Gospel Lighthouse and they uh [applause] Amen. They deserve every accolade that they have coming. And uh they they have the hardest job in the world trying to figure out what I'm about to sing or where I'm going to lead. And and uh I appreciate them. I appreciate sister Cassie, brother Randall, Sister Sarah, Sister April, Brother Greg, Brother Joel, Brother Jeffrey, and and uh all of the fill in, sister Phyllis, and Sister uh Deborah, and every every one of our young ones that are raising up that are I tell you what, we're a blessed church. And uh if you'd have been here Thursday night after our after our choir practice, and you would see what the future holds here at Full Gospel Lighthouse, you would go into Sackcloth and Ashes. And uh we had some kids get up here and got to playing and I I'll just be honest with you. I'm glad Titus is coming along to be the song leader for that. So, but I I I really [laughter] I'm just kidding. It was It was quite comical except for Sister Emma. We're going to keep her singing instead of playing the saxophone. But I I really do appreciate our musicians. I appreciate our trustees. I appreciate our deacons. I appreciate our pastor. &gt;&gt; I really do appreciate our pastor. [applause] Amen. [applause] The Lord has granted us six years uh with brother Ron. &gt;&gt; Six years that we have cherished, that we have loved, and we have seen the Lord use him like never before. And Christmas time is real special to all of us. But this Christmas time is always real special to the Spencer family and for the past six years because it was December the 19th that there where the Lord spoke to him and then he got those news that he was diagnosed with cancer. And we look at a man and we see how that he has fought. And sometimes you just take it for granted that a man stands behind the pull pit and that he just has the resilience and the perseverance to keep going on. But the internal battles that a man faces, even though he is a spiritual man, he's he's a man of faith, he still battles things. And then to see a man like that has the tenacity to stand up and preach this message against every evil foe. I appreciate the man of God. &gt;&gt; Not only is he my pastor, he's my dad. And I appreciate Brother Ron with all that is within me. And I know that you do. And we just want to say God bless brother Ron for all that he has done here at Full Gospel Lighthouse. We have a wonderful team of ministry here. And you see the leadership of Brother Ron as it's being poured out into these men right here. And we just we are very thankful for everything. Brother Brother Ron is not a selfish man whatsoever. He he shares his pullpit with us brothers. He allows us to minister and to preach the message of the hour. He puts confidence in us and he he loves these young people. what he he sees me doing with the youth. That is all that is I do. Anything you see me do, I run everything through brother Ron. We we are a wonderful team. And uh but brother Ron has his thumb on everything. And I appreciate him allowing us the liberty to be able to work with our youth and and then our our Sunday school, all of the all of the people that get to work with them. And we just want to say God bless our Sunday school teachers. And and I know it's a wonderful time. I always enjoy Sunday mornings walking watching those kids come in and and uh it's just a wonderful time. Do you love the Lord today? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. [applause] I want to just before we turn turn it over to brother Ron and change the order of the service, want to just remind you that we have our Christmas dinner next Sunday at the Whiters Cave Community Center and uh that'll be at 6 o'clock.

And I thank God for people that that were able to invent uh kidney machines. Brother Canari called me this week and he just didn't know it. But I was right in the midst of making some decisions and so do I do it or do I not do it? And he just literally called me and he said, "Brother Ron, I want to give you some word of encouragement. My brother's 67 years old and he's had lupus much of his life and he's on a kidney machine and he does really, really well." And so, Brother Canard, let of God, thank you. Thank you so much. Amen. And before we won't you turn and just shake a few people's hand around you and God bless you. Merry Christmas. Amen. [snorts] Amen. Amen. You turn with me to Luke chapter 1 and verse 26. If you if you wasn't here to hear brother Andrew last night, 35 minutes of of power dynamic speaking and it was wonderful and so I so enjoyed it and Amen. God bless you. Luke chapter 1 and verse 26. I want to speak today on the testimony of one. &gt;&gt; Amen. Our entire belief, the fundamental belief system that we all have hinges on the testimony of one person. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I want you to think about more than Mary, but you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Luke chapter 1 and verse 26. And in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee named Nazareth. to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph of the house of David. And the virgin's name was Mary. And the angel came in unto her and said, "Hail, thou art highly favored. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women." And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation that this should be. And the angel said unto her, "Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found favor with God. And behold, thou shalt conceive, and in thy womb bring forth a son, and shall call his name Jesus. And he shall be great, and shall be called the son of the highest. And the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David, and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there shall be no end." And then said Mary unto the angel, "How shall this be? See, and I know not a man." And the angel answered and said unto her, "The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee. Therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of God. And behold thy cousin Elizabeth. She hath also conceived and a son in her old age. And this is the sixth month with her who was called barren. For with God nothing shall be impossible. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now Mary responded here, "Behold the handmade of the Lord." These are powerful words. "Be it unto me according to thy word." And the angel departed from her. Let's read that last verse again together. And Mary said, "Behold the handmade of the Lord. Be it unto me according to thy word." and the angel departed from her. Amen. Maybe you have a need this morning. You just like to say, "Lord, come by and touch my me today." Father, it is in the name of Jesus, a name that is above every name. When it is called across the Virgin Mary's lips for the first time, a baby came to life in Elizabeth's womb. Now, dear God, we ask you that you you would come and be born in the manger of our heart today. We all have needs here. And Lord, we just thank you for what you have done in our lives. And I ask you that you would anoint and bless every person in this building, no matter how young and no matter how old. Bless them today. We pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. And amen and amen. You may be seated. I thought I would just share something with you on a lighter note before we go into the word. [snorts] [clears throat] Brother Brandham enjoyed Christmas. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, he enjoyed it. He enjoyed this time of year. [clears throat] My father was one that didn't enjoy Christmas, whether you realize it or not. Uh, it comes on every calendar. &gt;&gt; If you don't like it this year, it'll be back here next year. [laughter] &gt;&gt; My dad was one that didn't didn't enjoy it. Didn't like it. And so, we were in business. I was in business. I was a chimney sweep. &gt;&gt; It's good luck if you see a chimney sweep. So, all of you people are really blessed. I was at Chimney Sweep for many many years and we had a company and it growed and we won the Golden Top Hat Award eight times during those years and uh we were just blessed with it. During December, it was a time to where that um people didn't want us to come into their homes and and we needed to we still needed to eat. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, my dad my dad didn't appreciate this, but we we started a program called Keep Santa Clean. I would wear a red red coveralls and uh I would put a dollar in every stocking. And you know, those stockings grew through the years, you know, and we'd put dollars in and, you know, we we enjoyed it. Well, before long, before long, it kind of caught on over the years. It kind of caught on and why well, Christmas was booked all the time. December was booked all the time, you know. The kids enjoyed getting that dollar from the chimney sweep, you know, and [clears throat] and you know, as it would grow and as it would grow, we had some school teachers that decided, okay, we're we want the chimney sweep to come to our house. And we didn't realize it was going to be as big a deal as it was. And and uh we showed up to this house and there were school buses parked up and down the lane there. And I got out and uh you know I just for kicks I got it started and I'm on the roof and dad's dad's shaking all the kids' hands and he's he's doing all the teachers and it's a big deal. There's a video and we didn't have iPhones back then and I'm up on this roof at twotory roof and I'm up there and I've got a black brush and I got my top hat on. Now, [clears throat] this may blow some of your mind, but I started dancing across the roof, singing Jim Jiminy, Jim Jim, Jim Jim. Guess who enjoyed it the most? My dad. [laughter] Now he preach against Christmas but I was there when he was eating the cookies and the cakes and I was there and he would say thank God for cure Christmas. If you don't like it if you don't like Christmas you will get through it. Just take a deep breath. But we're going to enjoy it here. &gt;&gt; We're going to enjoy it. [applause] I thought you'd I'm not going to dance for you in this, but you won't believe how many dogs I had my picture taken with. And old Rover get to hug that with a chimney sweep, my top hat on, and brother Thomas, you know how it all works. And get TJ to dance on the roof. There you go. Get &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Just turn to your neighbor and say, "We're going to have church." I'd like to speak to you today on the testimony of one &gt;&gt; one. It's been used all through the scriptures. No doubt. You know, sometimes we think, well, if I had a hundred people around me that experience the same thing. Well, it don't work like that. &gt;&gt; It's individual. Amen. &gt;&gt; Two in the field, one to be taken and want to be left. &gt;&gt; Two in the meal, want to be taken, want to be left. Two at the meal, want to be taken, want to left. Two in the bed, want to be taken, want to be left. I've always prayed I'd be taken. We must come to the conclusion today that it's supernatural message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We must understand that this message has been visited by an angel, the Lord. &gt;&gt; We must also understand that God took his messenger when he was done. &gt;&gt; Everything was delivered. It was orchestrated by God. It was from one sermon to another sermon to another sermon. No matter where Brother Brandham would be speaking at, whether it was in Switzerland or whether it was wherever it was at, it was it was just one right after another, every sermon seemed to build on each other. And the angel was always there. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The angel that met him in a cave was always in attendance. &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on. &gt;&gt; And and and I want to just share this with you. He wasn't just in attendance with brother Brandham, but he's in attendance with message churches around the world. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham had to leave, but now the message is with us. &gt;&gt; And the same angel of God is with us in attendance with us. Are you with me now? It doesn't matter where you see him or where you feel him. God is watching over this message. And every one of us have a story. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Every one of us have a story of how we got here. &gt;&gt; You may be the only one in your family. &gt;&gt; You may be the only one on your job. You may be the only one in your school. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would preach a sermon for you. One in a million. &gt;&gt; GOD PREDESTINATED YOU. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; And how much of we thank God that he predestinated us as sons and daughters of God &gt;&gt; not to be a manger 2,000 years ago &gt;&gt; but to be a living temple of almighty God. &gt;&gt; This is more than history. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is more than history where animals will be seen in manger scenes and and and let me just say this to you. We appreciate all of that, but I want to be the manger. &gt;&gt; I want to be the TEMPLE TO WHERE GOD CAN LIVE IN. &gt;&gt; It's great to have pictures on the wall, ornaments, statues. It's great to have all of those things, BUT I WANT HIM TO LIVE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; I WANT HIM TO PULSATE IN MY LIFE. &gt;&gt; Now we understand when a prophet speaks uh God's vision and it becomes prophecy. No doubt Isaiah when he speaks uh behold a virgin shall conceive. Can you imagine how many critics he had? &gt;&gt; Now years go by. Now Isaiah passes off of the scene. No doubt all the false prophets and the false will come now to criticize him. &gt;&gt; We have ours. &gt;&gt; And they they criticized him. And that prophecy circled the earth &gt;&gt; for hundreds of years. &gt;&gt; But there's an interesting thing about prophecy. It intercepts with time at some point. Now, she wasn't from the who's who, &gt;&gt; BUT GOD PREDESTINATED a womb. &gt;&gt; Let me just SAY THIS. YOU, GOD DIDN'T SEARCH HER OUT, search through all the women. &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T SEARCH THROUGH THEM. HE KNEW WHO HE WAS coming to. &gt;&gt; HE KNEW EXACTLY. BROTHER RANDOM, YOU can go back and listen to it in Mary's belief. you know, she's a spouse to Joseph and and and and they went to service. The prophet will put put it kind of in a wonderful form. He said the rabbi opened the scrolls and he begins to read today his thoughts was was on Isaiah. &gt;&gt; Behold, a virgin shall conceive. and he quoted it across his lips that had no doubt been read thousands and thousands and maybe even hundreds of thousands of times. But today, &gt;&gt; BUT TODAY like David heard Goliath speech, it didn't matter to nobody else. Oh, they were afraid of it. But today, David showed up. today in a little temple. Mary came to her spot. &gt;&gt; BROTHER BAM SAID THEY WOULD GO HOME AND SAID, "JOSEPH had everything just right." Whenever I read that quote, Brother Terry, I think about you're a perfectionist and and you're a carpenter. You just have a way of doing things. I think about Joseph. No doubt how incredibly crafted his house was in preparation for family. Brother Brandham will say, I had somebody tell me one time years ago said, "How do you know, brother Brandham saw that?" I said, 'Well, how do you know what Mary what Eve's hair was? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram tells us that Eve had blonde hair. &gt;&gt; And then he'll tell us that he watched he watched them walk out of the garden. He said the other night when I was preaching, I watched them walk out of the garden. &gt;&gt; So, I'd say he had a good idea. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. NOT JUST PAST, BUT HOW ABOUT FUTURE? &gt;&gt; I BELIEVE HE SAW US SITTING AT the &gt;&gt; sitting at the table thousands of miles long. They were sitting at on a on a porch and they begin to rehearse what the service was like. Sun was beginning to set. And she said, "I just felt something. I felt something when the rabbi read that scripture. Behold, a virgin shall conceive." I hope we feel the same thing when we talk about rapture. &gt;&gt; And the next day, the prophet would say, "She's going to the well." No doubt a lot of people were going to the well, but today she would meet an angel. That angel no doubt standing about 6' tall dark complexed just cold black hair. Brother Brham would you know he would explain him so well &gt;&gt; cuz he also met an angel of the Lord. Hallelujah. His deep set eyes how it would be. That angel be to speak to her. Let me just say nobody was in attendance of this conference. &gt;&gt; MAYBE YOU CAN SIT IN an audience of 300 people and you are spoken to personally. &gt;&gt; Take that very reverent AND SAY, "BE IT UNTO ME. LORD, &gt;&gt; be it UNTO ME, LORD, ACCORDING TO thy word. Who is this Jesus? Can I just read this for you today? He came from the bosom of the father to the bosom of a woman. He put on humility that he might put on divinity that we might put on divinity. He became the son of man that we might become sons of God. He came from heaven where the rivers never freeze. Winds never blow. Frosts never chill the air. I want to go there, don't you? &gt;&gt; Flowers never fade. No one is ever sick. &gt;&gt; There will be no undertakers and no graveyards. And no one ever dies. No one is ever buried. He is born contrary to the laws of nature. lived in poverty, reared in obscurity, crossed the bound never only crossed the boundary of his land once in his childhood. He had no wealth nor influence, neither training or formal education. His relatives were inconspicuous and influential. IN INFANCY, HE STARTLED a king. In boyhood he puzzled the wise men. In manhood he rolled he ruled the course of nature. He walked upon the billows and hushed the sea to to sleep. He healed the multitudes without medicine and made no charge for his service. He never wrote wrote a book. YET ALL THE LIBRARIES of a country could never hold the books that have been read written about him. He never wrote a song. Yet he has furnished the theme of more songs than all the songwriters combined. He never founded a college. Yet all schools together cannot boast of as many students as he has. &gt;&gt; He never practiced psychology, psychiatry. Yet he healed more broken hearts than doctors has healed broken bodies. He never marshaled AN ARMY, DRAFTED A SOLDIER, FIRED A GUN. Yet no leader ever has found more volunteers, &gt;&gt; who have under his orders made rebels stack their arms and surrender without firing a shot. Right? &gt;&gt; He is the star of astronomy. &gt;&gt; He is the rock of ge geology. He is the lamb of God. How powerful is our God? &gt;&gt; The harmonizer of all discords, &gt;&gt; the healer of all diseases. Thank God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Great men have come and gone. Yet he lives lives on. Herod could not kill him. Satan could not just seduce him. Death could not destroy him &gt;&gt; and THE GRAVE COULD NOT HOLD HIM. [applause] &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. &gt;&gt; What a mighty God. &gt;&gt; WHAT A MIGHTY GOD THAT JESUS IS. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham would speak these words. He said a testimony before a person has has to have a experience before they can testify. If you were called to court, you'd have to have give a testimony. You have to know something before you can testify. &gt;&gt; Amen. And a witness is a person who has seen something that knows that it is the truth and they are called to give a witness. A witness must KNOW WHAT HE'S talking about. &gt;&gt; He must not someone who told me certain certain secondhanded. Let me say it. He must be a witness himself. If not, he is speaking of someone else's and then he's not a true witness. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Let me just give you just a bit of a theme here. THERE WAS JOSEPH, THE HUSBAND OF MARY, and now he was engaged to a young lady and there and they were to be married. And then before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost. Now, we all believe that. That's what brother says. If we're Christians, &gt;&gt; we all believe that. &gt;&gt; If we're Christians, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; We must believe that in order to be a Christian, the Bible says that you got to believe every word in the Bible &gt;&gt; to be a Christian. NOW, NOW BECAUSE IF IT'S THE HOLY SPIRIT is in here, it'll punctuate every word and every promise with an amen. &gt;&gt; NOW, BECAUSE JOSEPH WAS A JUST MAN, he was a good man. And no doubt that Mary had told him the visitation of Gabriel and how that she was to be overshadowed by the Holy Spirit and was to conceive and bear a son. and his name was to be called Jesus. How that she must have told him that to Joseph. And Joseph could look at her big brown eyes and he could see the innocence of it. Notice these next words and he wanted to believe it. &gt;&gt; He wanted to believe it. He wanted to believe it with all of his hearts. Yet it was too unusual. This is next to had to have been heart-wrenching. And he was minded to put her away privately. Now, if a man is sincere in it, God will make a way to show that man that it's the truth. He's obligated if you're sincere to see it and walk away. Then you're to be judged. BUT IF YOU'RE SINCERE and see the truth now, Joseph was minded. It's so unusual. That's the way it is today. PEOPLE, good men, fine men, good character men, fine ministers. Many of them priests and so forth are good men. But the supernatural vindication of the promise of this day is so unusual. &gt;&gt; IT THROWS THEM OFF OF THEIR BALANCE. And and it does that because it displaying the characteristic of God. And Joseph, her husband, BEING A JUST MAN, NOT WILLING TO make her a public example, he couldn't believe it. He tried to I want you to get that. He tried to. BUT WHILE HE THOUGHT ON THESE THINGS, THE ANGEL OF THE LORD, I think this is so powerful. THE ANGEL LORD SPOKE TO HIM and told him that he doesn't always speak in a dream. He can reveal himself to you by the by the word and show you that it's right if you're sincere enough &gt;&gt; to look into it and to SEE IF IT'S GOD'S CHARACTERISTICS that's displaying itself. but always in every account with a promised word. And another thing, the word always corrects the error. &gt;&gt; I think that's so powerful. &gt;&gt; THE WORD ALWAYS corrects the error. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; THE WORD SETTLES IT. WHEN GOD VINDICATES THAT WORD, it settles it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You imagine having a conference with God. You and God having a conference. Remember, it's not you that called the conference. &gt;&gt; God called the conference. &gt;&gt; Let me just say, you need to be so thankful in this season. that he revealed himself to you. &gt;&gt; Listen, I want this church to be more than just a community of people. &gt;&gt; I want it to be more than just a place where we come and enjoy each other's singing and worship &gt;&gt; and listen to a sermon. LET ME JUST SAY, I WANT THIS PLACE TO BE A SUPERNATURAL PLACE. &gt;&gt; CAN WE SAY IT? I WANT THIS PLACE TO BE A SUPERNATURAL PLACE TO WHERE GOD CAN REVEAL himself to you. [snorts] I've got a little fellow that sits here on this front row. He's he's probably one of the youngest guys here and he texts me every week. Brother Ron, you're my friend. Said something to me the other day. He said, "Brother Ron, I love you so much." He said, "I don't see how that anybody would not love you." He didn't know. He didn't know what that meant to me that day. You guys travel a couple hours. I want to thank you. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart. &gt;&gt; I want to thank you. [snorts] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. I'm a little bit emotional this morning. It's a good morning to be emotional, isn't it? &gt;&gt; The prophet said there was a time I'm thinking of somebody that met God, a little virgin. She had something to believe. Never been a baby born in the world without a father and a mother. We know that. So we find out that Mary, a little virgin on her road down to a well one day a great light shined upon be before her and she looked be standing there in the light and there stood Gabriel. The archangel said, "Hail Mary, blessed art thou amongst women and told her exactly [snorts] what was going to happen." Now, a few days before there, he had met a priest, her cousin's husband, Zacharias, and he was standing at the altar waving incense. And Gabriel appeared and told him that he was going home to with his wife and and have a child and was going to call his name John. &gt;&gt; AND THE PRIEST SAID, "HOW CAN THIS BE? I'm too old. It can't happen." No, it can't happen. And he said, "I'm Gabriel." and he sent and sent from the presence of God. My word will be fulfilling in their day and you'll be dumb till that day baby is born. Two different responses. &gt;&gt; One from a priest DOUBTING WHAT THE ANGEL SAID. &gt;&gt; BUT MARY HAD never preached A SERMON. SHE SAID, "BE IT UNTO ME &gt;&gt; ACCORDING TO THY WORD." &gt;&gt; But here he comes to the little virgin. Zachariah Zacharias would have had plenty of examples for he had found out that there was Hannah when a baby when she was old. Sarah had a baby when she WAS OLD. PLENTY EXAMPLES IN THE BIBLE. BUT STILL HE WAS C cautious from it, callous from it. But Mary had to believe something that had never happened. But she had met God &gt;&gt; and said, "How it will be, and the Holy Ghost will overshadow you, and thou shall and and this thing shall be born in you, be called the Son of God." And she said, "Behold, the handmade of the Lord." She had met God. I I love these next words. She couldn't hold her peace. &gt;&gt; She couldn't hold her peace. I IMAGINE SHE TOOK THAT JUG BACK TO the house and and took it out testifying everywhere. Her little cheeks were just fleshing saying, "I'M GOING TO HAVE A BABY. &gt;&gt; I'M [snorts and screaming] GOING TO HAVE A BABY." AND SHE went up INTO THE HILLS AND BEGAN TO TESTIFY TO HER COUSIN, I'M GOING TO [screaming] HAVE A BABY. &gt;&gt; AND ELIZABETH WAS CARRYING THAT BABY and it never had moved six months now. It had never moved &gt;&gt; dead in its mother's womb. Mary begins TO GIVE THIS SALUTATION OF WHAT THE ANGEL had told her. She believed it with all her heart. And the most supernatural thing happens when she calls his name on earth for THE FIRST TIME. &gt;&gt; HIS NAME SHALL be called Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that baby in Elizabeth's womb shouted, &gt;&gt; "RECEIVE THE HOLY GHOST &gt;&gt; IN HIS MOTHER'S WOMB." LISTEN, GOD'S GOING TO DO SOMETHING. You have a supernatural testimony. You'll share it with everyone around you. &gt;&gt; I want you to understand this wasn't part Mary and part God. &gt;&gt; This was all God. &gt;&gt; It was all God. It'll be that way in your womb. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It'll be that WAY IN YOUR WOMB. &gt;&gt; GOD WANTS TO HAVE ALL OF YOU. &gt;&gt; HE DON'T WANT PART OF YOU. &gt;&gt; HE WANTS ALL OF YOU. &gt;&gt; Our surrender to God, BODY, SOUL, AND SPIRIT. GOD WANTS TO BE THE KING ON THE TABERNACLE OF OUR HEART. God became sin so that we could become his righteousness. God sent his son to hell so me and you wouldn't have to go. &gt;&gt; Listen, for a believer today, it said over and over, "This is as close as we'll ever get to hell." &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hell is a real place. &gt;&gt; It's said by Jesus more. He talks about hell more than even heaven. WHY WOULD HE DO THAT? HE CAME TO SAVE YOU FROM going there. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HIS MISSION on earth being born into THIS REALM WAS TO TAKE CURSED EARTH. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH ME? THAT WHEN WE WERE BORN OF THIS CURSED earth and our mothers ate our body out of the GROUND TO TAKE THAT CURSED EARTH AND BE BORN AGAIN [cheering] &gt;&gt; WITH THE LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST LIVING ON THE INSIDE of us. [applause] Satan is always near when God's doing something. &gt;&gt; You know, it seems like when you're born again, all of a sudden, you start fighting against all kind of forces &gt;&gt; that you didn't fight against when you were a sinner. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There's a ear that you begin to hear negativity, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? BEGINS TO TELL YOU, "YOU didn't meet God. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; God God don't love you. Those people don't love you. &gt;&gt; Why would you go to church two times a week? [snorts] Why do you listen to a preacher preach for over an hour? You can go right down here and get a 15minute sermon. &gt;&gt; Come on, buddy. &gt;&gt; WHY DO YOU PASS ALL OF THESE OTHER CHURCHES? WHY DO YOU PASS ALL OF THEM? THEY'RE GOOD PEOPLE, BUT SOMETHING KEEPS HOLDING YOU. [applause] &gt;&gt; Every sermon THAT YOU HEAR, IT SOUNDS LIKE HEAVEN ALL THE TIME. &gt;&gt; I don't CARE HOW MANY TIMES I'VE COME TO CHURCH THROUGH all my life. I get something out of every service. &gt;&gt; I go home from these services after I preached. Listen, not everything's in note form. &gt;&gt; I go home and write down what I got out of it, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Because I want to hold on to it. &gt;&gt; I want to hold on to every moment THAT WE HAVE WITH GOD. &gt;&gt; He bypasses a million to come to you. Now, let me just say in the supernatural realm, could I just say it like this? Mary couldn't explain it. She just couldn't explain it. Science couldn't prove it. Religion don't understand it. But the word overshadowed all of it. Mary ate like she normally ate. But there was something happening on the inside of her. &gt;&gt; Let me just SAY THIS. YOU SOMETHING HAPPENS ON THE INSIDE OF YOU. &gt;&gt; You can't explain it. &gt;&gt; SCIENCE NO DOUBT CAN'T PROVE IT. RELIGIONS AROUND you don't understand the change that's taking place. BUT THE WORD WASHES YOU. &gt;&gt; IT WASHES YOU FROM THE RELIGION. IT WASHES YOU FROM THE SIN. &gt;&gt; IT WASHES YOU FROM ALL THE NEGATIVITY. &gt;&gt; And it begins TO GROW ON THE INSIDE OF YOU. &gt;&gt; YOUR HOME CHANGES, YOUR ATMOSPHERE CHANGES, YOUR SPEECH CHANGES, &gt;&gt; YOUR MIND CHANGES. GOD GIVES YOU LOVE LIKE YOU'VE NEVER HAD IN YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; HE GIVES YOU A JOY. &gt;&gt; One angel, one message, one surrendered heart, and the word became flesh. &gt;&gt; God still works the same way today. He sends his word and gives his testimony &gt;&gt; and looks for a believer who will say, "Be it unto me &gt;&gt; according to thy word." &gt;&gt; Mary didn't question it. SHE DIDN'T ASK FOR CONFIRMATION. &gt;&gt; SHE DIDN'T WAIT FOR SOMEONE ELSE TO AGREE. SHE SIMPLY SAID, "BE IT UNTO ME." &gt;&gt; Can I read it again? Mary didn't question it. &gt;&gt; SHE DIDN'T ASK FOR CONFIRMATIONS. SHE DIDN'T WAIT FOR SOMEBODY ELSE TO AGREE with her. SHE SIMPLY SAID, "BE IT unto me according to thy word. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [applause] If these bones would let me dance, I'd dance." Come on. &gt;&gt; One brother Ron, one Noah &gt;&gt; WITH ONE MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; ONE MOSES WITH ONE MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; ONE ELIJAH WITH ONE VOICE. &gt;&gt; ONE JOHN THE BAPTIST COM PREPARING OF the way OF THE LORD. ONE MAN standing on Mount Carmel. &gt;&gt; One William Brham. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; I'd like to say one Ron Spencer. &gt;&gt; One. [applause] Say it with me today and put your name there. &gt;&gt; I'm going to say one Ron Spencer. You call your name. Let's say it loud enough so the angels can hear it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; WE'RE MARRIED TO ONE JESUS CHRIST. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [applause] &gt;&gt; I'D LIKE TO SAY I BELIEVE. I BELIEVE. [cheering] AMEN. &gt;&gt; The prophet would say he never left himself without a witness. God always has a witness. And any man that serves Jesus Christ will not have many friends on this earth. You have to stand on your conviction alone. MANY TIMES YOU HAVE TO STAND BY YOURSELF. &gt;&gt; BUT HE PROMISED THAT HE would stand with you. Oh, glory to God. [snorts] &gt;&gt; HE PROMISED THAT HE WILL stand with you. &gt;&gt; I'll be with you until the end [clears throat] &gt;&gt; of the world. &gt;&gt; Mary had to believe something that was totally impossible, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That had never happened before. SHE DIDN'T STAGGER AT IT. SHE JUST SAID, "BE IT UNTO me according to thy word." Mary said, "Behold the handmade of the Lord." And she started rejoicing. She was happy. God had promised it. [laughter] And she was she was going to have a baby. I believe I spoke something about that last night and we just heard it. I believe I spoke. HE SAID SHE DIDN'T WAIT till she felt it. &gt;&gt; She didn't wait till she felt it. &gt;&gt; I'm going to SAY IT AGAIN. SHE DIDN'T WAIT TILL SHE FELT IT. &gt;&gt; SHE DIDN'T WAIT TILL SHE WAS POSITIVE. She didn't wait for any visible sign. &gt;&gt; SHE JUST BELIEVED. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; She believed what the angel said. [applause] There you are. The trouble is we want to question God. &gt;&gt; IF WE QUESTION GOD, WE CAN'T BELIEVE GOD. Faith is a substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things that you don't see, taste, feel, smell, or hear. Brother said, "I begin to feel a little bit religious right now." &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT. TAKE GOD AT HIS WORD. &gt;&gt; JUST AS SOON AS SHE HEARD IT, FAITH COMETH BY hearing and by hearing of the word of God. FAITH COMETH by hearing. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SOON AS YOU hear the WORD OF GOD, THAT SETS YOU FREE. &gt;&gt; BELIEVE IT. REJOICE WITH IT. GOD WILL SHOW THE EVIDENCE that you're accepted. &gt;&gt; You don't have to jump through a bunch of hoops. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Ron, but I DIDN'T FEEL NOTHING. IT'S NOT BASED ON YOUR FEELINGS. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; DO YOU believe it? [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; I DON'T UNDERSTAND. IT'S NOT BASED ON YOUR UNDERSTANDING. &gt;&gt; The scripture SAID, "LEAN NOT TO YOUR OWN UNDERSTANDING." &gt;&gt; THIS IS NOT A PUZZLE WHERE YOU PUT ALL THE PIECES TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Along with believing comes new births. Along with believing becomes all kinds of emotions, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Did I cry? Oh, I'd say I've cried many times. &gt;&gt; Did I shout? Oh, I've shouted many times. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'd say that if you know when I was younger, I'd like to done a flip like brother Joel Forny. [gasps] BUT IT'S NOT BASED ON MY HUMAN EMOTIONS. BECAUSE IF IT'S BASED ON YOUR HUMAN EMOTIONS, THERE WILL COME A TIME when you don't feel it. &gt;&gt; BUT IF IT'S ANCHORED IN YOUR HEART, ONCE IT'S ANCHORED, THERE'S NO GOING BACK. &gt;&gt; NOW, let me just leave my notes for a few moments. Listen, as long as her belly was flat, there wasn't a whole lot of criticism, just words. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But when she began to protrude, &gt;&gt; when she began to protrude, I was thinking of this sermon the other day. These notes have been here for for weeks now. Am I kidding doctor? She probably weighs 110 pounds. She's going to have a baby in February. Listen, you don't have to guess where she's pregnant or not. She said, "Now, Ron, I'm not going to be your doctor in February. I'm going to be off for a few days, but I'll have somebody to be watching over you. I'm going to be off for a few days." Listen, I didn't have to hear those words. &gt;&gt; I knew &gt;&gt; she's pregnant, baby. &gt;&gt; You couldn't put enough donuts there to make her look like that. Cookies and cream won't make her look like that. She'd been with a man. That's what happened. Mary had been with God. &gt;&gt; Mary had been had a visitation. &gt;&gt; And it is now more than a thought. &gt;&gt; It's now an action. Something's growing on the inside of her AND SHE'S EATING HIS BODY OUT OF THE GROUND CUZ HE'S GOING TO FIX what Eve &gt;&gt; messed up. &gt;&gt; He's not going to come as an angel. &gt;&gt; HE'S GOING TO COME AS GOD IN human form. &gt;&gt; AND COMING AS A VIRGIN BIRTH, HE'S GOING TO FIX THE original sin. Come on, church. He's going to fix it all the way back. [applause] &gt;&gt; HE'S GOING TO FIX YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE IN SIN. &gt;&gt; HE BECAUSE HE WAS BORN &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE'S BORN &gt;&gt; BORN TO DIE. HE'S GOING TO FIX &gt;&gt; our lives. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I know we don't like the government and it's coming tax season. The year is going to flip and especially for businessmen, they hate tax season. Just something about the IRS they they don't like. But that's how you have roads. That's how you have schools. That's that's how you have a lot of things. It's how you have Somalia. Some of you get it today. Some of you get it tomorrow. Some of you never get it. God knew that Joseph would never move. &gt;&gt; He would never leave leave Nazareth to go for that baby to be born in Bethlehem. &gt;&gt; You see, God had a place for that baby to be born. Right. &gt;&gt; He had a place &gt;&gt; and he had to force he had to force Joseph to move. &gt;&gt; Sometimes in the the biggest things that you hate, God's in it. &gt;&gt; Some in your most difficult times, Brother Ron, God's in it. This guy over here last night preached me a sermon. And I went home thinking about it all evening. Brother Ron, if you have to be at diialysis, somebody's going to be there that you got to witness to. &gt;&gt; And you couldn't get to him any other way. Well, what he don't know, the guy that I that I witnessed to for 11 years at the Arsenal, five years after I leave the Arsenal, Roger comes to the Lord. &gt;&gt; I worked with him for 11 years. One night I was preaching on a Wednesday night and here Roger walks into the building, walks down the aisle and says, "I want to give my heart to Jesus. YOU DON'T HAVE TO PREACH TO ME ALL THE LAWS of the message. &gt;&gt; You did that for 11 years &gt;&gt; now. ROGER WAS A GOOD GUY AS a Baptist. He was goodnatured. But listen, God caused me to have to work at a bomb factory for one soul. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Listen, he will send you THROUGH THE VALLEY TO get one. [applause] Brother Ron, you want truth? I want some proof. I want to see it. Okay. Six years I fought cancer. But the vision came before I was documented with cancer that I would go through the deepest trial of my life. But there WOULD BE ONE AT THE BOTTOM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. of that pit standing there waiting for me to get there. Sister Melissa, would you stand? &gt;&gt; ONE SOUL'S WORTH 10 MILLION WORLDS. ONE. ONE. [applause] Sometimes what looks impossible, GOD [screaming] TAKES YOUR IMPOSSIBILITIES AND BRINGS IT TO PASS. &gt;&gt; Can I tell one more? [snorts] &gt;&gt; I was called to preach your mother's funeral. She had been gone for several years. Sister Janetta called me and said, "Mom, want you to preach her funeral." When I got the call, I was just because there's a certain place in the road where I talked to her mother the last time. And every time I come across that hill going down through there, I remember our laughs together and our joys together, Sister Betty, and I [sighs] I actually question what's going to come out of this. I actually asked Connie, I said, "What do you think's going to come out of this?" I walked into the room, Brother David, where the family was gathered and Janetta hugged me. We had prayer. I quoted some scriptures. I walked into the funeral place where the service is going to happen. And as I'm walking and I turned in and looked and the Lord spoke to me and said, "Today I'm going to begin to deal with Janetta and she's coming home." &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I don't know if I believe that. It don't matter. &gt;&gt; I'm driving a point now. It don't matter. &gt;&gt; It don't matter. Don't matter where you believe it or not. &gt;&gt; I know. Amen. &gt;&gt; I know. [applause] And when she screams and when she dances, I know &gt;&gt; it wasn't my voice. I know. &gt;&gt; Sister Melissa, when I hear you sing and I see you sitting with Brother Tom and I see YOUR FAMILY, I I KNOW. I know. Are you with me now? I'm going to preach to you. &gt;&gt; ON DECEMBER THE 22ND, GOD SPOKE TO ME six years ago [snorts] and said, "IF YOU'LL TRUST ME, I'LL use you like never before." &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; I thought that was going to be a lot of different things. But six years later, I stand here and I've had a lot of difficult days. Amen. &gt;&gt; I I actually just call it the day to throw up. I call it the today called achy day. I call the day to where my head hurts so bad. Then there's good days. And I'll just say, "Wait till tomorrow. Tomorrow's going to be a good day." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I'm not a whiner. I'm not a complainer. And don't take it THAT WAY. BUT GOD'S with me. Amen. &gt;&gt; You said, "Brother Ron, I don't know so much about your story about an angel visiting you in your office." I GOT NEWS FOR YOU. I KNOW. [applause] &gt;&gt; I know. I KNOW. AND THAT'S WHAT KEEPS ME GOING ON. &gt;&gt; IF YOU'LL TRUST ME, I'll use you like never before. I know. I know. [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; You can stay standing. You can say you know &gt;&gt; you know where GOD MET YOU. YOU KNOW WHAT WAS GOING on in your heart. &gt;&gt; You know when he met you in a certain spot. And the DEVIL CAN SAY ALL HE WANTS TO. AND THE DEVIL CAN COME AND CRITICIZE YOU ALL HE WANTS TO. &gt;&gt; BUT YOU KNOW. &gt;&gt; You know. &gt;&gt; Brother Andrew. You know. &gt;&gt; You know. I know the exact spot it happened. You know, brother Matthew, you know. Amen. &gt;&gt; Matt Mar, I wasn't there with you, but I see the evidence of it. &gt;&gt; You know, &gt;&gt; your daughter's GOING TO GET BAPTIZED TODAY. AND THE SAME GOD THAT LIVES ON THE INSIDE OF YOU can live on THE INSIDE OF HER. WHAT A DAY. [applause] We didn't plan this. Sister and Melissa, will you come and sing Mary? Did you know? &gt;&gt; And the whole choir is going to stand and sing it with you. Cuz we know. &gt;&gt; We know. Turn to your neighbor and say, "I know that. I know. I know. I know, brother. That's a funny way to end the service. Well, I'll finish it next week. &gt;&gt; It won't spoil. &gt;&gt; Have you enjoyed this weekend? LISTEN [applause] to more more than just lyrics. Listen to a miracle. Hallelujah. God bless you. Mary. [music] Did you know [singing] that your baby boy would one [singing and music] day walk on water?

Will you be that one? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Will you testify and say, "The Lord has come by my way. &gt;&gt; He has touched my life. &gt;&gt; And now touch someone else's life." &gt;&gt; Amen. This This time we're going to change the order of service. We're going to invite Sister Ella to come prepare for baptism this morning. Maybe as she's preparing to come, uh, we'll sing that Living Hope this morning. I'd like to try that. And then also after service we have a uh gift for uh each family. So uh for each family there is one gift as you're dismissed uh after the baptism this morning. Maybe we'll just uh sing that. How great the [music] laid between us. How high the mountain I could not climb. In desperation I turned to heaven [singing] and spoke your [music] name into the night. [music] Then through the darkness.

What it is this day is a day of dedication of We witnessed the Holy Spirit deal with the McCloud family all the way from the oldest to the youngest. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Little Ella, her name means beautiful. In the Greek and English, it means to be a light and a torch. And I pray this day that she would be a torch for our Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Sisteraptus Christaptism. Lord Jesus, today is a very special day. &gt;&gt; Lord, we recognize that we have come to a time where children are after the very heart of the father. &gt;&gt; Lord, you said suffer the little children to come to you. We had a prophet tell us that when you would begin to deal with their heart, that's the time to baptize them. Lord Jesus, you have worked with our sister Ellen. And Lord, today is a wonderful day where we recognize that the angels in heaven are rejoicing over one sinner that is repenting. Father, we know what it's like on this side of things. How our hearts are rejoicing. I see these parents, their heart is just bubbling over. I cannot imagine how heaven feels this morning. We pray Lord Jesus that according to thy word Father as I would baptize her in this watery grave that you would baptize her with the fire of the Holy Ghost that you would be the light or the torch in her life father that when she goes to school when she fellowships when she is being a friend even maybe while she's just talking with maybe an elderly person she has such a sweet spirit I watch her Lord Jesus and I see that how she carries her mother spirit to talk and to minister and to listen. She obeys. She hears. But I pray that this would be different now, Father. Lord, I pray that you would use her in a way, Father. I pray, Lord, according to thy word, as I baptize her with water, that you'd baptize her with the Holy Ghost. You told us to go into all the world to teach and to baptize in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Peter grabbed that revelation on that day of Pentecost. And so, Father, According to that revelation, I baptize our little Ella Mlar in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. [applause] &gt;&gt; Praise him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [applause] That's what he come for. That's the revelation of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. Amen. Won't you just turn to your neighbor and say, "Merry Christmas." It is good to be in the house of the Lord this morning. Remember, we have a gift for each family as you're dismissed this morning. So, God richly just bless you as we're dismissed to sing. Go tell it, tell it on the mountain, over the hills and everywhere. Now go and tell it, tell it on the mountain. Jesus [music] Christ is born. Oh, go and tell it. Tell [music] it on [singing] the mountain. Over the hills and everywhere. [singing] Go. Tell it on the mountain [music] that Jesus [singing] Christ is born.
