thrilled about that and amen so we're glad to have him here he's going to be baptized here in a few weeks and and we're trying to work on the time to make that happen a my a bless your Zach a mile a mile each and every one of you a man what you're trying to give your neighbor of salutes and I sure pray that this that this nonsense will be over in a few days and we can all be together and on being a ropes and masks and stuff and it's not a good time to go marry a man or a woman I don't want you to know that amen so amen so just my hair so we certainly we certainly love you we congratulate our our graduates and and maybe later we can do that all properly and and you know we just live in a very different time and we'll get it through an end but it's been awesome for me because it's given me great privacy at home to go through this sickness and and amen if you're sick definitely don't come in my house so amen and thank you for letting me come in a little bit late and leave a little bit early over this last couple services and and that's kind of what we will do for a bit I was I'm still on restrictions and Mary Mary I'll find you there you are don't you dare tell Amen I got a seer in the morning we don't wander no and I'm preaching yet so a my god bless you Luke chapter 10 and verse 17 amen I want to speak to you this morning on who is Jesus part 2 and I I spoke a few weeks ago on who is Jesus and just to give you a little idea I'm not going to hold you very long and so if you can just bear with me until I begin to get my strength back I sure would appreciate that we certainly love you with all of our hearts I had a friend go to be with the Lord this week in ivory coast Africa and he's a pillar there brother Eric and we want to remember the churches that he was involved with there I preached in many meetings with him and he was a pillar and so we we just want to remember that that the audience's that are affected by his death and he was a he was a younger man I'm pretty sure that I am and they just had a real short illness and went to be with the Lord amen I want to go to be with the Lord any time he wants to call your amens may not be very good right there but it's kind of like a man and woman walking through heaven and they're walking and they're looking at all the sights that they're seeing and as they're walking through you know and they're looking at this and pointing at that and pointing at that and he looks over at his wife and he said you know she said isn't this great and he said you know we'd have been here five years ago if you hadn't had me on that good diet amen we know better than that but the footsteps as the righteous are ordered of the Lord amen god bless you Luke chapter 10 and verse 17 and the seventy returned again with again with joy saying Lord even the Devils are subject unto us through thy name and he said unto him I beheld as Satan as lightning falling from heaven and these are Jesus's words behold I given to you power to tread upon serpents and scorpions and over the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you notwithstanding in this rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven and I want you to catch that just a moment we live in two worlds and we see with our senses but God wants to you to see beyond what you see he wants you to see beyond what you see into an eternal realm and then that our Jesus rejoiced in the spirit and said I I thank the old Father Lord of Heaven and Earth that thou has hid these things from the wise and the prudent and hath revealed them unto babes even so father it seemed good in and good in the sight all things are delivered to them of my father and no man knoweth who the son is but the father and who the father is but the Son and he to whom the son will reveal him and he turned unto the hid under his disciples and this is an incredible statement he turned unto his disciples and said privately this is a statement blessed are your eyes which see the things which you see I can't put enough emphasis on those words at this present moment I can't put enough emphasis on those those words blessed are your eyes for they see for I tell you the truth that many prophets and things have desired to see the things which you see and have not seen them and to hear the things which you hear and have not hurt them amen let's speak to the Lord now Almighty God how we love you with all of our hearts now we thank you to be in your house this morning I pray that you'd bless this audience bless this group of people those that are at home and maybe that we can only in a few more days be able to all come together I pray chip bless our church strengthen us watch over us touch our bodies even now as I stand here to speak I pray that you touch me in a supernatural way father I need your touch and I need to touch and I ask you that you help me now in Jesus name Amen and amen amen you can be seated many would look at this man as a frail man I'm not going to even attempt it they would look at him as a frail man standing there that day and maybe in his little body probably wouldn't have been waved a hundred and fifty pounds slender body aging way too quickly but even many would ask who was this Jesus maybe you even even ponder why's that I would begin a series on who is Jesus at this time in our lives I'm afraid that too many that even said in church had missed who Jesus really is are you with me more than just God sent a message to this earth and they missed the message but Jesus stands in operating rooms he stands in the halls of governments and they turn him down he stood in many churches and they now have Ichabod written across the door even in message churches many times we miss what God is doing right among us sitting in pews a lot of times people sit and think about you know if my favorite speaker was speaking or maybe the conditions were a little bit different and they miss Jesus case in point brother Branham would call people out by name called them out by name tell them the condition one particular individual that I'm thinking about now call them out by name tell them seven different things about himself come away from him and go to another patient and pray for it across the building that pillar fires hanging over top of you now and then call them out and then go back to the man don't miss it don't miss it many times the word is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart you don't need brother Branham to call you out today or some great man to call you up the word is the discerner of our heart and when that spirit begins to draw to your heart it's your opportunity to respond that even God would think about me for all the greatness of God and all the responsibilities that he has of making the world turnin and making everything just right that Great God can can come to a service with just a handful of people sitting there and and be ministered to and then you would be the focus of that service I just have to say I find all that quite quite astounding this weeks we've had we've had an incredible turn of events riots have happened in her streets happening across the world I'm sure your world has spend just a little bit maybe on your jobs you've heard the nonsense and maybe even call some family struggles amongst you maybe even made you feel a little bit tense by it all maybe made you think things say things maybe that you normally wouldn't say that that you would feel like that you become a part of the conversation you see there's a spirit that's risen in America and across the world is the season for rapture it's a season for rapture and certain anointings are being released on the earth today you see God allow certain elements to fall into places with me God's in control of everything and he allows certain elements to fall into place it's listen to riots not a new thing it was a riot when Jesus was on the scene and he was standing there in that frail body with the crown of thorns on his head and insurrectionists were happening and they choose a man named Barabbas hurry with me and there were followers of Jesus asking the question what has Jesus died he's Hilter sick he's raised the dead what has he done that's worth covering what has he done that's worth being beat like no other human beings ever been beat they've done the message the same way they've done the message the same way I got a note this morning they're blasting brother Branham for picking up a little black baby and and and and he just uses a term you know you know that that would be unappropriate or unsocial today you know I just have to be honest with you it didn't matter that little baby was healed but the random lived in a different day but people want to character blasted today you missed the point you you missed the whole point if you want to stain him brother branham's jobs been done pray with me it's done the message has been delivered don't feel not only now no need to slamming now you're only bringing a stain on yourself people want to go back and say well Jesus never lived they want to say all different kinds of things I want to tell you he lived because I'm proof they write and here they are rioting and they don't have an answer the government don't have an answer and I know these leaders of this a nonsense don't have an answer I'm a hundred percent sure that but they're screaming for something and don't know what they're screaming for I was sharing this with Andrew this week and I said you know it's the same spirit all of the nonsense is happening but look past the riots look past of what's going on don't look at what's in the paper don't look at what's in the news there's a bride that's gathered you look past these riots you look past this covet you look past these things that you see there's a bride that's formed I'd like to just take you to with the few thoughts in there brother Branham says that Moses was that was raised by Pharaoh's daughter and of course his own mother actually was became his nurse and took care of him and she told him as a child of who he was but she could tell him but it took a revelation and he would walk past the window many times in his life brother Brennan said he would look out that window and see mud daubers out there and he would see he would see those people working and they were building they were building a huge a huge city of structures he would later become a great leader and to which that he would be overseen many things but one day brethren who said he came to that window and those mud daubers he realized that they were God's children hurry with me brother brother said he saw beyond his senses he saw beyond his senses he saw he will look beyond what he saw with his naked eye and saw the children of God a nation that was not there watching you know it's easy for us to look and I won't just kind of capture just for a moment it's easy easy for us even sitting here you're not to be careful you'll feel tangled up in this world you feel insecure you wrestle with who you are you forget who you are you you forget what God deposited on the inside of you look past your gray hair look past your glasses look past the sickness that you're fighting with in your life look past your job look past your temporary situation you're not built for this world your citizens of another Kingdom we build houses we buy cars we we have IRAs and we have we have a we have our banks never bank records and all of that means nothing at the end of the day you just become an obituaries column it's what you do and you hand off a few things and you would call treasures many times that we'll go to an auction and bring nothing literally in the things that you thought was so great became so petty people get so consumed by petty things but if we can look past the pettiness of life and looked at this point tell you it's not about what you see it's not even about what you see about yourself rather Harold Hildebrand always made a statement that I found that was so good he would say do you know why we we know that man is great he told us great men make you feel great great men make you feel great we as if with the boys were talking one day and I said you know we don't have to describe how big the Giant is were fighting today he'll tell us he'll make sure that we know that he's nine foot tall and he's got a Weaver's beam and you don't even have to pause you know David didn't measure him David didn't measure him he just made sure he had five stones are you with me maybe you would have been in the mud that Moses was looking at be from where you were standing you couldn't even see Moses maybe you were thrashing in the hay trying to make brick pulling them ropes maybe a slave master was beating you today you just happen to be the one that's picked out to be beaten at the same time God was revealing to his prophet there are my children not just to go to Kanaan's land not just to walk across the Red Sea but they're going to be in an eternal book that is written about them and some of those women that are gathering straw in the mud up to their knees are daughters of God that have an eternal purpose in the kingdom of God so in that 24-hour cycle and you're thinking you're having a bad day God's looking from another realm and what you're going through today is only temporary [Applause] [Music] how many times that I've heard whispered in my ears over the last few weeks Satanist whispered in my ear I have rendered you useless these are stupid death I've got you too long and you're preaching days are over with and your convention days are over with just let me catch my breath they told Andrew before they walked out here today I said there's not anything in a bottle that will make your head spin like mine spinning this morning but I'm still going out there because I'm going to remind him one of these days I'm gonna remind him one of these days when I'm standing at the end of those prayer lines sake don't wanna remind you when you cross brother branham's baby's eyes and he looked down in those eyes and it moves something in his life that you could never move away from him he said every cross-eyed baby that came across that pulpit many times I didn't even pray for them come on church sick pets on the wrong kids [Applause] saying that to say this you may be standing in the straw of life and your feet feels like it's mud all the way up to your knees and the slave masters are beating you in this temporary period just think just for a moment this is really temporary I'm not just going to Eiland I'm going to the land this world is not my home I'm just a passing through [Applause] we're being gathered here to go to another world we've been gathered here to go to another world whether it's in China when I was there and now some of those men that I gathered with us prisoners in a prison he asked the other day one of the pastors wives she was in the prayer line on the last service and so I was very concerned about her because she had some she had a situation in her life she had complexes she never wanted anybody to come to her home and her home is not like your home her home was much smaller than most of our homes it'd be it'd be about the size of half of that best of you back there maybe we've got one or two or ten or a hundred here this morning that wood has the same problem shed germophobia and so she didn't want visitors to come to her home and even when her children would go to the washer and she'd go in and clean up real quickly and and when it has been good washing heat she go and clean up real quickly and and to have a visitor in her home soon she would if you set your cup down when you picked it up she'd wipe it off she just didn't want no company wonderful sister but she had a real phobia now her husband is a pastor of the church and gathering them and you know she came in the prayer line and God was so mindful to call her out and talk to her about that phobia that was holding her back she fell on the floor but she came back up brother Tom I heard Tom asked her is he gonna be okay for us to come to your house tomorrow she said after that we look to her home maybe I shouldn't be sharing these things but we went to their home and we got tea that would be so out of the ordinary for her to let us have tea but tonight today her husband sits in prison for brother Denny carrying the Bibles you know what I'm talking about now as a matter of fact me and you would go we would go to prison now for that even for what you did we'd go to prison for what we did but when it came time for him to go to prison he didn't recant he didn't say no I'm not going to heart prison folks on me to say he could spend the rest of his life in a hard labor camp in prison it's been almost two months and he hadn't had a proper meal yet hasn't had a shower yet in those two months but in that two months he's led some people to the Lord so you got to see past what you see in America we've got it really good and we drove to church this morning Minh and we're not going to be arrested now there's no churches in China they're all busted up and I had a man tell me the other day said that sister said oh no she hasn't recanted she's down at the police station every day she's not ashamed to be called the Christian here's that dainty little woman down at the police station come on Church God give us some grit to look past what we see are you with me in the hell in that land over there that woman will be hailed as great woman he hailed as a great man and for carrying the gospel of Jesus Christ but brethren let me just say the cost is worth it the other morning night I got out of bed yes sir two days ago share this with you we're one of the tumor sets at it causes me when I go to sleep to have nightmares and those nightmares are beyond anything I ever thought a nightmare is I can go to sleep in the day and I don't have a nightmare and I can just sleep extremely deeply and fall into a deep sleep in just a few moments but at night when I lay down and I go to sleep we can pray and feel the presence of God and in just a moment go to sleep and nightmares begin to proceed because of the illness they can't remove that tumor because it would affect some very very delicate census of my body and I I don't want to I don't want to give up knowing who I am to be honest with it it's not worth trading off I want to be able to know who you I'm talking to when I preach to you and so the other morning I'd had the presence of the Lord in my home and when I went back to sleep he I dreamed the most horrendous nightmare that they've dreamed in the whole period of time and I woke up and Connie was coming in the room and I just have to be honest with you I begin to scream out why me God what am I going through this why me I was just thankful to wake up and that that wasn't real Connie cried with me and holding me and I walk into the washroom and I get it on the note I was gonna save it for another time but some things won't save and here were the words that came for me even for one you go through this even just for one yeah and I said I just apologized very quickly i falled yes so quickly brother branham said he said God would come to the earth and be hungry like a man and they'd spit on him they make fun of him and he'd go to Calvary for one and sorry I don't have everything just together just like maybe as polish to say I say normal yeah but it's okay I would just want to share this with you I'm glad God held this trial to this period of my life so I would get the deeper purpose of it cuz two months earlier I was chasing the dollar trying to make away from my family but all that's taken care of I stood on the stage with Gary Walker in New Zealand one time Gary had been crushed in an accident and he went through a horrendous rehab for a year and he made a statement that was astounding he said I'd do it all again if I could help one person I would say that would be the case now for me I would say that when they were taking Jesus's life different people saw different things some saw a religious man a self-proclaimed prophet died some saw insurrectionist maybe even a political opponent self-proclaimed king Diane Mary knew what she was looking at she knew what she was seeing her mind's eye was much further than a natural little boy that he grew up in her home she'd met the angel of the Lord she was there when it all supernaturally happened and she standing watching him and as he's finishing up and he screams it is finished listen wait screams it is finished the earth itself the people that was standing on it couldn't realize the full volume of what it just happened this who is Jesus brother Ray had now paid the price of redemption he lifts me now he had now paid the price of redemption and now he could restore the order completely back to the errors he could bring man back into fellowship again and reconcile us back and with me and he was paying a price that no man could pay how did they put him there on the cross three things he said he was God He healed on the Sabbath they accused him of things that was trivial trivial and when Jesus was standing there in front of Pilate and all of the screams that was happening Barabbas Barabbas Barabbas this man's atmosphere was so powerful unto which pilot couldn't hear the screams he was enough I'll never forget one night I was in bed and I heard a voice speak to me and they said go and pull out a book this book was in the 1800s written and they said I'd never read the book and I pulled it out and I opened it up and now you're going to get a part you've heard it before but it opened up and it says that and he was taking it from some historical writings said Pilate standing in the realm of the great Jesus atmosphere and the world was upside down around them but his atmosphere was so tremendous and to which he could say I find no fault in this man hallelujah what an atmosphere of who Jesus really is what an atmosphere of who Jesus really is let me just say this to you tonight if I could just finish with them with a couple quotations if we could look at him that's him in creation we can go back to the beginning that was him putting everything together just his presence his creation we watched in turn water into one we watched him take fish and feed 5,000 people and twelve baskets leftover that's a physics lesson and I can't imagine what as brother and said that little boy that missed school that seeing beyond what you see that's him and the power of his creation how that he can take one tenth of what you give back to him and take that one tenth and bless you beyond all your neighbors don't even try to explain it don't even try to explain how God does business but God can take one tenth of your income and bless you beyond I was standing one time and it was dealing with a businessman that it came to her house and he was just looking around he said how did you get what you got I said one tenth how'd you get what you got I said one death I said no I I don't I I I've got a salary I'll get a salary I said I didn't get this with my salary I said but I got this with one tenth I found the bank world gives you a hundred percent on one tenth and it's not overseas somewhere another he will bless you beyond what you will ever look around yourself and point to some things in your life brother Steve and go that's him when things are spinning out of control and you don't have control no more and God's actually moving your world he's moving your world and he's open and doors and closing doors and you stop and go what is going on in my life just simply take this thought from this morning service that's him but rather on it looks like your life's in chaos you're looking at the wrong thing that's him but your life is spinning out of control oh no that's he I'm I'm speaking from a deeper realm than I've ever spoke in my life because I can look at things now that I see and say that's him [Applause] not something 2,000 years ago today yesterday this week that's him when the doctor looks and say tumors are shrinking that's him [Applause] if we should go back to Bethlehem and look at the scene don't pity what you see don't pity him heaven delay in the manger it's fulfilling Scripture God don't need to pity he's not going to invite kings and potentates to his birth he's bringing shepherds to his birth because that's him even had to explain his birth now but that's him I'd like to tell you whether it would be in in a little place in North Carolina walking out on the stage with Henry Greene sitting on the platform and he said when brother Branham walked up on the stage he said he'd saw the great a a Alan's walk on the stage people applauded their personalities and applauded who they are and wanna feel overwhelmed at this great man he said but when we and Brandon were walked on the stage he said all I could do was sit there and weep you see beyond the land beyond that man was him oh no brother Branham wouldn't God no more than neither of you and I and I could say this this morning if you turn to your neighbor and you go oh I feel so sorry for them what they're going through or your head dogs just a little bit and goes poor old brother Ron he must have sinned to have to go through something like this oh you're looking at the wrong thing what you're seeing is God at work in humanity of you you see and st. John chapter 6 and 15 he controls disasters whether Donnie he controls great difficulties in our lives never forget when you came to the Lord you made a statement to me I'll lose it I'll lose a lot of things my statement back to you you've lost a lot of things in this world but you gained in Jesus thus tenderfeet this morning god bless you what you see a frail man or did you see the King of Kings

is worth seeing him you will earn now picked with helping Chinese Bibles get into hands I didn't tell you to put that on your heart that was him that did that I'd say it's worth it all it's absolutely

what you see because that Eagle can fly higher than any other bird there's a lot of things that other birds just see on the surface they can't get no higher than a mountain that's just what they say but you are not called to be just another bird you are an old God I heard a prophet scream out and tell me that I M&E you're an eagle for gospel lighthouse there things that you were called to rise above fly higher and higher you go the more you'll see oh if we could just get our eyes off of these things the things that we see what a God that we serve that would come and tell us that our light affliction which is but for a long look not at the things that you see for the things that you see are temporal but the things that you do not see are return now God told us that he'd be here this morning now I probably say that 99% of you didn't see God in his spirit realm or a pillar of fire near this morning but just because you didn't see him does not mean whatsoever that it wasn't here for he told me and he told you that I'll never leave you and I'll never forsake you so we can look past what we see here gheh haze' take your eyes off what you see and look to that unseen rail and in that realm is everything that you have need of this morning in that realm just a little bit further is healing deliverance it's everything that you have need of in this life's journey they said they're right before you you know they tell us that if that if a snake catches a bird's attention and he can gather his attention and and he grabs ahold of him that little bird will flutter and he can't get away in that snake or grab it but if that bird can get its eye off of that serpent and look upward he can fly away to where he was called to fly if we can get our eyes off of the serpent and look to what we were born to do Oh what places will go little Eagles maybe we sing that song this morning I'm coming back to the heart of worship as we would go forward in this service this morning when the
