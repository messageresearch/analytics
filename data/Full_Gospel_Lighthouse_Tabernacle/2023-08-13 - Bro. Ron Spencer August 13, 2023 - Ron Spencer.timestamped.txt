[37:24] line went so after 12 o'clock last night
[37:27] and
[37:28] they probably prayed for about a
[37:29] thousand people and
[37:33] we spoke on Friday night and had an
[37:35] incredible time and it's been an
[37:37] incredible meeting and so

[37:41] the meeting
[37:42] brother Alden advised me to just stay up
[37:44] there and rest but uh

[37:53] but that don't mean that mother nature
[37:55] don't take over and I'm wore out but but

[38:04] preaches this morning and God's doing
[38:07] great things around the world and so

[38:13] days

[38:24] it back

[38:48] week and those things are difficult and

[39:41] mansion it'll be okay and so
[39:44] if you will turn with me in your
[39:45] scriptures this morning to Genesis
[39:46] chapter 24.
[39:52] am I
[39:54] good to be here isn't it
[39:58] we certainly love him with all of our
[40:00] hearts and
[40:11] Genesis chapter 24 and verse 12. this is
[40:15] the text that brother Branham spoke of
[40:18] choosing of a bride
[40:22] and he said oh Lord God of my master
[40:25] Abraham
[40:27] I pray thee
[40:29] send me good speed this day and show
[40:31] kindness unto my master Abraham
[40:35] behold I stand Here by The Well of water
[40:39] and the daughters of the men of the City
[40:42] come out to draw water
[40:44] and let it come to pass that the damsel
[40:47] to whom I shall say let down thy picture
[40:52] I pray thee that I may drink
[40:56] and she shall say drink
[40:59] and I will give thy camel's drink also
[41:02] and let the same be that she that that
[41:06] has appointed for thy servant Isaac and
[41:12] thereby shall I know that thou has
[41:16] showed kindness
[41:17] unto my master
[41:19] it's quite a statement right here
[41:22] and I want to I want to spend a little
[41:24] time with that let's pray Lord Jesus we
[41:27] love you today
[41:28] we're so thankful for what you're doing
[41:30] we realize that we're standing right at
[41:33] the edge of the into the end of the
[41:36] Gentile dispensation
[41:38] father all things are ready the bride is
[41:42] prepared to go home not just in little
[41:45] small regions but around the world
[41:48] and Lord we ask you now that you would
[41:50] speak to our hearts and anoint us wash
[41:53] us and we shall be clean touch our

[42:01] your hand right now Lord sister Peril is
[42:04] at a very dark hour we ask you that you
[42:07] would be with her brother Bill Hinkle
[42:09] Lord Brother Roger the many others Lord
[42:12] Jesus that have great needs we asked you
[42:15] to send your word and touch them today
[42:17] Father
[42:18] thank God that there's a land beyond the
[42:21] river Lord we ask you for traveling
[42:24] safety for our children that are
[42:25] becoming home from Ohio not just our
[42:28] children but Lord there's just people
[42:31] from all over the states and even
[42:33] overseas that's at that meeting I ask
[42:36] you that you would watch over them and
[42:38] anoint brother Timothy as he stands even
[42:40] now in the Pulpit to speak and I know

[42:45] that but I pray that you had anoint his

[43:19] it's incredibly important where brother
[43:21] Branham took his text from and choosing
[43:23] of a bride
[43:26] he had been sent to call out a bride for
[43:29] Jesus Christ
[43:31] the Full Gospel businessman was a place
[43:33] to where that the denominations didn't
[43:36] feel so intimidated they didn't want to
[43:38] have him in their churches but some of
[43:41] them would come out to where he was at
[43:43] and and even then there would be be men
[43:47] that would boycott the meetings and tell
[43:49] their people not to go I just want to
[43:52] share this story with you brother Kelly
[43:54] hildebranch church was one of the places
[43:58] to where that you know their their
[44:00] founding pastor
[44:02] would would begin to believe the message
[44:04] and and the local pastors would tell him
[44:07] that you know don't go to that that
[44:10] meeting in Saskatoon we need to stay
[44:12] away from that cult and stay away from
[44:15] that Ministry and they would tell their
[44:16] people don't you go it was a huge Hall
[44:19] that was rented for brother Branham to
[44:21] preach in and it would seat thousands
[44:23] and there was only about 300. but what
[44:27] brother Gunther found that all of those
[44:29] men that told their people to boycott
[44:30] all those men were sitting on the front
[44:32] rows
[44:35] so they're told they're people not to go
[44:37] but they went themselves
[44:39] and brother Gunther began to listen to
[44:42] the message and he found out that it was
[44:44] something that that he could believe and
[44:46] it was something that was actually open
[44:49] in the scriptures for him and so from
[44:53] that became a a church there
[44:56] that's the way the message was spread
[44:58] all around the world
[45:00] you know what others didn't want to hear
[45:03] there was a bride that was interested in
[45:06] listening to the message of the hour
[45:09] brother Branham standing and choosing of
[45:11] a bride and he would begin to he would
[45:13] begin to talk about you know that that
[45:16] that that elohiser was being sent then
[45:20] he began to describe that you have a
[45:22] choice
[45:24] and you have a choice for your education
[45:26] you have a choice of where you want to
[45:28] live you have a choice for your church
[45:31] and the ministry you have a choice
[45:35] you have a choice God Don't Force
[45:37] nothing on you you have a choice but
[45:39] that predestinated sea
[45:43] we'll hear the message of the hour as he
[45:46] begins to go through the message and no
[45:48] I'm not going to repreach it but as it
[45:50] begins to go through the message he
[45:51] begins to describe that God's looking
[45:54] for a wife
[45:57] a wife that has character a wife that
[46:01] can be Washed by the Water of the word
[46:04] and she will not be she will not be a
[46:08] woman that will be manhandled by
[46:10] denomination she will come out from
[46:13] among those groups and hear the word of
[46:16] the hour
[46:19] that doesn't mean that they're they're
[46:20] going to hell
[46:22] but God's going to have a wife
[46:26] he's going to have a wife that will
[46:28] reflect him that will reflect his
[46:31] character now now let me just say we
[46:34] were married to our first Union our
[46:36] first nature
[46:37] and no doubt in in some of that and some
[46:40] of you were Tangled in denominational
[46:42] ideas had all different kinds of
[46:45] thinking you know even in our first
[46:48] nature we we had to have that to die
[46:51] that first nature that we were married
[46:54] to that thing had to die inside of us to
[46:57] have Christ to live on the inside of us
[46:59] the first nature had to die new husband
[47:02] had to come and come to the king room of
[47:05] our heart
[47:06] and the word began to wash us
[47:09] now if you're a predestinated seed it
[47:11] doesn't offend you whatsoever
[47:16] it just doesn't offend you now there
[47:19] might make things that you look at it a
[47:21] little clock at it for a little while
[47:22] but after a bit it begins to wash you
[47:26] and clean you up
[47:29] and the spirit of God comes on the
[47:31] inside of you and you grab a hold of the
[47:34] word and you begin to say that's nothing
[47:37] but the truth
[47:41] How will I know brother Ron you will
[47:43] identify yourself with the word now now
[47:47] when we're talking about a bride that's
[47:50] Universal
[47:52] and no doubt in in man's thinking well
[47:55] we must have a headquarters well we do
[47:59] it's the Holy Ghost
[48:03] well we must have great schools of
[48:05] teaching well we do
[48:08] God is raised up men
[48:12] that have laid aside denominational
[48:14] thinking
[48:16] and then Washed by the message of the
[48:18] hour
[48:19] we've we've had young ministers here and
[48:21] I will continue to have young ministers
[48:23] here that have been raised up in the
[48:26] message and the and it just to me proves
[48:29] that this message is alive and well
[48:33] the other day we we had brother Nathan
[48:36] here and as he stood there he didn't go
[48:39] to some theology
[48:41] school and spend years there but he's
[48:44] been washed by the word here stood in
[48:47] Matthew last night there stood William
[48:49] last weekend
[48:51] there stands Andrew
[48:53] every weekend here for us and and you
[48:56] hear the word and you think well you
[48:58] know they must have went to a school and
[49:00] I and the reason I'm saying that
[49:03] let me just say this to you if you stop
[49:05] and listen to some of these even these
[49:09] television evangelist here's voice
[49:14] here's boys that can outpreach them guys
[49:17] a million to one
[49:19] [Applause]
[49:27] and not only has It produced a Ministry
[49:30] it's produced to people
[49:35] and people ask how do you produce a
[49:37] people like that the spoken word of God
[49:41] [Applause]
[49:43] Hallelujah
[49:45] now now remember remember the sin that
[49:49] had to drop off your life
[49:51] God had to cleanse us of all of those
[49:54] things he begins to wash us and forgive
[49:57] us of our sins we begin to move forward
[50:00] and just like in the Book of Ruth and
[50:04] we've been we've been dealing with it
[50:05] for a few weeks in the Book of Ruth if
[50:07] you will notice something and I and I
[50:10] and I'm going to borrow this from Nathan
[50:13] brother Nathan Erickson he he said you
[50:16] know in Ruth he said there's no
[50:19] remembrance of what she used to be and
[50:21] that's what we've been preaching
[50:23] no doubt Boaz would not let anybody talk
[50:27] about where she came from
[50:29] or her former or her former life but
[50:34] Boaz is the hero of the book
[50:38] he is the Redeemer that brings her in
[50:41] and elevates her from almost like an
[50:45] orphan lady
[50:47] with an incredible history but he
[50:49] elevates her to be Queen
[50:53] and the seed that she that's produced
[50:57] through her womb brings her into the
[51:00] body of Christ
[51:02] but notice when God allows them to write
[51:05] the book he doesn't call it Boaz
[51:11] he calls it Ruth
[51:16] I love that don't you
[51:18] so we're no longer under our old nature
[51:24] or we're no longer chasing the kings of
[51:27] this world but we're Washed by the
[51:30] influence of the mighty angel
[51:32] and let me just say this you brother Ron
[51:34] do we still have you know I still have
[51:37] trouble I still have situations in my
[51:39] life you'll always have that
[51:43] you'll always have that you're always
[51:45] going to have some of those things in
[51:47] your life because listen your flesh
[51:51] is not born again
[51:54] and even on the day of the Rapture
[51:57] you're going to face some difficult
[51:59] situations because Satan knows that he
[52:03] is coming to the end of fighting you
[52:07] and you're his torment his worst enemy
[52:10] you're here you're his nightmare
[52:12] he has did everything that he can to
[52:15] attract you and pull you out of this
[52:21] are you with me now but you're married
[52:23] to another king
[52:26] are you with me but the gene seed of God
[52:29] is eternal
[52:31] and there's a major difference between
[52:33] the gene seed of God and your fight in
[52:36] this natural realm you'll always have
[52:39] difficulties
[52:41] how can we walk out of a service brother
[52:43] Timothy and it feels like the Rapture is
[52:45] getting ready to happen and then on
[52:47] Monday morning
[52:52] Brother David how can you walk out of
[52:54] service in incredibly enjoy the service
[52:56] like this and then in a week
[53:00] because we're still living in this realm
[53:02] [Applause]
[53:04] now watch this but there will be a spot
[53:07] and I want to drive this there will be a
[53:10] stop spot to where we'll never again be
[53:14] touched by the hands of the enemy
[53:17] Oh Glory
[53:20] now watch this
[53:22] a drop of ink
[53:25] now that ink was made for a purpose
[53:28] that color that color was for a purpose
[53:32] that one drop of ink
[53:35] can either sign your death warrant
[53:38] and send you to an electric chair or
[53:42] that drop of ink
[53:43] can pardon you of your sins
[53:48] and it was set in there
[53:50] it was sitting there for a purpose we've
[53:53] got to use it for the right thing
[53:58] are you with me Matthew finished with
[54:00] this and I thought it was incredible in
[54:03] Ephesians chapter 5 verse 22 life submit
[54:06] yourself to your own until your own
[54:09] husbands as unto the Lord
[54:12] for the husband is the head of the wife
[54:14] even as Christ is the head of the church
[54:16] and is the savior of the body
[54:19] therefore as the church is subject unto
[54:23] Christ
[54:24] so let the wives be subject unto their
[54:26] own husbands and everything
[54:29] now that don't make you an abuser man
[54:35] are you with me
[54:36] listen and sisters you don't have to
[54:38] live in an abusive home
[54:41] husbands love your wife even as Christ
[54:44] also loved the church and gave himself
[54:48] for it
[54:49] that he might sanctify and cleanse it by
[54:54] the washing
[54:55] by the word
[54:58] so what men to love their wives as their
[55:01] own bodies
[55:04] are you with me
[55:08] turned my head and I lost my place so
[55:15] that he might sanctify and cleanse it by
[55:17] the washing of the Water by the word
[55:19] that he might present it to himself as a
[55:22] glorious Church
[55:23] I love this statement
[55:25] not having spot
[55:27] or wrinkle
[55:29] or any such blemish
[55:32] but it should be holy and without a
[55:35] blemish
[55:37] are you with me now what a statement I
[55:39] want you to read this with me
[55:41] that he might present it to himself a
[55:46] glorious church not having spot or
[55:50] wrinkle or any such thing that it might
[55:53] should be holy and without blemish
[55:57] brother Ron does that mean we're going
[55:59] to have thoughts in this life you'll
[56:01] always have thoughts
[56:04] does that mean we're going to have
[56:05] difficulty with our nature we'll always
[56:08] have difficulty with our nature but God
[56:10] has provided a blood
[56:13] he has provided a message that when God
[56:17] looks at you not how you look at you or
[56:20] even at one another but when God looks
[56:23] at you
[56:24] you're a glorious Church
[56:28] and not have a spot or wreak or any such
[56:32] thing
[56:32] but that it should be holy and without
[56:35] blemish
[56:38] sought men to love their wives as their
[56:40] own bodies
[56:41] he that loveth his wife loveth himself
[56:46] for no man ever yet hated his own flesh
[56:49] but nourisheth and cherish it even as
[56:52] the Lord the church for we are members
[56:55] of this body of his flesh and of his
[56:58] bones for this cause shall a man leave
[57:01] his father and mother and shall be
[57:03] joined unto his wife and they shall be
[57:06] one flesh
[57:08] notice these next words this is a great
[57:11] mystery but I speak concerning Christ
[57:15] and the church
[57:17] Proverbs chapter 31 and verse 10 if
[57:20] you'll put that up for me
[57:26] I don't know about you but I read out of
[57:28] Proverbs most every day
[57:30] you'll find it in my devotions to read
[57:33] out of Proverbs most every day
[57:35] but all through the Book of Proverbs it
[57:37] talks about difficult
[57:39] difficult situations of women
[57:42] it'll talk about the adulterous women
[57:48] it'll talk about bossy brawling women
[57:54] better to dwell on the rooftop
[57:57] you get it
[58:00] but if the closing chapter
[58:03] he writes about who can find
[58:07] a virtuous woman
[58:11] now notice
[58:13] Solomon is writing and God is igniting
[58:16] him to write
[58:18] I'm looking for a bride
[58:21] because that's God's crowning
[58:23] achievement that's the reason this
[58:25] message came
[58:27] I'm looking for a bride that can be
[58:30] without spotter blemish
[58:33] I'm not looking for a bride that will be
[58:35] like the other books of of proverbs
[58:39] but I'm looking for a bride that who can
[58:42] find a virtuous woman
[58:45] for her price is far above rubies which
[58:51] is concerned considered true rubies
[58:54] greater than diamonds
[58:57] the heart of her husband that safely
[59:01] trust in her God's saying these words my
[59:05] heart
[59:06] is trusting you
[59:08] so that
[59:10] that he shall have no need of spool of
[59:14] spoil now just think about it
[59:16] our past history
[59:19] is put away
[59:23] our past thoughts our past actions are
[59:28] put away in the mind of God
[59:30] when we talk about the Sea of God's
[59:32] forgetfulness
[59:34] and we talk about what God throws our
[59:37] sins
[59:38] then many would say God puts up a sign
[59:41] and says no fishing
[59:44] but it is Satan that comes and digs up
[59:46] the bones
[59:48] and wants to take those The Old Man and
[59:52] bring it back up again I'm not talking
[59:54] to the right Church
[59:56] but we're not Catholics here
[1:00:00] we're not Catholics here we don't beat
[1:00:03] ourselves for what we used to be
[1:00:06] we don't believe in a Purgatory are you
[1:00:08] with me now we don't beat ourselves over
[1:00:11] the back the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:00:15] that cause us the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:00:18] has washed us
[1:00:22] are you with me now washed us now listen
[1:00:26] those things will always lay in your
[1:00:28] memory
[1:00:31] they'll always lay in your memory but
[1:00:34] remember that's not the Eternal part of
[1:00:36] you
[1:00:38] your flesh Satan has an access to your
[1:00:42] spirit
[1:00:43] affections memory all the emotions that
[1:00:46] you go through all of those things Satan
[1:00:49] can get to that
[1:00:52] yeah
[1:00:54] he can get to that and bring up things
[1:00:56] that you ain't thought about for 40
[1:00:58] years and he'll bring that up
[1:01:02] and it's then your responsibility to say
[1:01:04] hey there's a blood that's took care of
[1:01:06] that
[1:01:07] I'm not that man anymore
[1:01:12] now
[1:01:13] I actually got the note here
[1:01:15] here I had an old friend
[1:01:17] he was a friend in the world and Matthew
[1:01:20] was so beautiful
[1:01:22] but he was a friend in the world and he
[1:01:25] and I got into a lot of trouble together
[1:01:28] and in any way we were together probably
[1:01:32] especially in my teenage years and then
[1:01:35] up into my early 20s and so we we we did
[1:01:40] a lot of stuff stuff that I don't want
[1:01:42] to go over I'm not I'm not wanting to
[1:01:44] mention this morning
[1:01:45] and so when the boys we were actually
[1:01:48] buying Andrew a Mustang
[1:01:51] and Connie still wants one but
[1:01:54] but anyway uh
[1:01:56] we make a truck out of it we'll be doing
[1:01:59] really good
[1:02:01] but anyway uh
[1:02:03] he wanted to come and see me and he was
[1:02:06] constantly after me brother Donnie
[1:02:08] wanted to come see me we'd call me about
[1:02:11] every week and we would talk and you
[1:02:13] know and you know I talked to him about
[1:02:16] the word talk to him about Christ and so
[1:02:18] one day I said yeah yeah come see me and
[1:02:21] so he drove about two and a half hours
[1:02:23] here and
[1:02:25] you know I I told him I said I'll meet
[1:02:27] you at McDonald's because it's just
[1:02:28] right below where we're buying a car at
[1:02:30] so you know we went in and we sat down
[1:02:32] we had a sandwich and we were sitting
[1:02:34] there talking and and and and he had
[1:02:37] long curly hair and you know and you you
[1:02:41] begin to talk and he was one of those
[1:02:43] guys that had a place between his teeth
[1:02:45] you know and didn't need a toothpick
[1:02:47] there and and so anyway you know we we
[1:02:50] had experienced a lot of things together
[1:02:52] and so I I thought well if he's drove
[1:02:55] two and a half hours he he wants to talk
[1:02:57] to me about some things so he began to
[1:02:59] talk and you know the boys were sitting
[1:03:02] there and they were they were listening
[1:03:04] to him and I instructed let's just
[1:03:06] listen to what he's got to say and they
[1:03:08] were listening to him and he took me
[1:03:10] through Tin Can Alley
[1:03:12] what we used to doing what we used to do
[1:03:15] and what we used to doing you know he'd
[1:03:17] sit there and laugh at those things and
[1:03:19] you know I just I just remember all of
[1:03:21] that
[1:03:22] you know I I let him go for about a half
[1:03:24] an hour
[1:03:26] and I said well Eddie I need to tell you
[1:03:29] something
[1:03:30] the man you're talking about these boys
[1:03:33] don't know
[1:03:40] these boys don't know that man
[1:03:42] you see the man that you knew he died
[1:03:50] and I'm giving you a lesson here the man
[1:03:53] that you knew
[1:03:55] the man that you knew brother Marcus
[1:03:57] that Man's dead
[1:04:01] he's dead
[1:04:04] he's dead now this looks like the same
[1:04:06] house
[1:04:08] it's got a little bit more gray hair
[1:04:09] it's not built like it used to be but
[1:04:12] it's the same house
[1:04:14] but there's a new king
[1:04:18] there's a new man that lives on the
[1:04:20] inside of here
[1:04:24] are you with me now what God gives you
[1:04:27] the Holy Ghost for is to bring this man
[1:04:30] into check
[1:04:31] [Music]
[1:04:34] now
[1:04:36] how many is in here just ever rode
[1:04:38] horses
[1:04:40] oh yeah yeah I was raised with horses we
[1:04:43] we the first Vision that I ever had was
[1:04:46] about a horse
[1:04:48] and I saw getting a brown horse that was
[1:04:51] a pinto horse and it was a tall horse
[1:04:54] and I saw it I was sitting on a rock and
[1:04:57] and I saw us getting this horse I told
[1:05:00] my dad that and he said well we'll look
[1:05:03] around a little bit well a few years
[1:05:05] later he bought me a pony
[1:05:07] that wasn't a vision a few years later
[1:05:11] that horse was three years old and we
[1:05:14] went to an altizer Farm who raised
[1:05:16] horses
[1:05:17] and uh I said dad right there it's the
[1:05:20] horse
[1:05:21] so Dad told the man the vision and he
[1:05:24] was asking pretty incredible amount of
[1:05:26] money for it and he said if that boy had
[1:05:28] a vision that he was going to have that
[1:05:30] horse he said I'm just gonna I'm just
[1:05:33] gonna give you this horse for it was
[1:05:35] almost a giveaway
[1:05:37] and that horse I rode that horse for
[1:05:40] years now that horse was a spirited
[1:05:43] animal
[1:05:46] it was a spirited animal he had his own
[1:05:49] nature
[1:05:51] and he and he stood he stood quite tall
[1:05:53] he'd still be over my head now which
[1:05:56] don't have to be real tall
[1:05:58] but
[1:05:59] you know when you got on him he would do
[1:06:02] a whirl
[1:06:04] and and doing a whirl you you had to be
[1:06:06] ready when you're
[1:06:09] when your buttocks
[1:06:11] hit the saddle you better be ready to
[1:06:14] take control
[1:06:16] and so because he was quick in his feet
[1:06:19] we made a cutting horse out of him and
[1:06:21] he was quick in his feet and and he
[1:06:24] could run like the wind and I just loved
[1:06:27] it when I was alone and I just put my
[1:06:29] head right down in his Mane and he would
[1:06:31] just
[1:06:32] you know because he would get low and he
[1:06:35] would run
[1:06:37] but there was times that he wanted to go
[1:06:39] to the barn
[1:06:41] because he was done I wasn't done
[1:06:45] but he was done
[1:06:48] but you see I was the controller
[1:06:51] and I had a bit in his mouth and I and I
[1:06:55] had rains in my hand
[1:06:57] I love that animal
[1:06:59] and if you was in my office now there's
[1:07:01] about
[1:07:03] 40 horses in my office remingtons but
[1:07:07] anyway anyway these I would I would take
[1:07:10] him and even as a boy and let me just
[1:07:13] say I wasn't a very Stout boy
[1:07:16] but I graduated weighing 133 pounds
[1:07:21] and so I was just a skinny guy but
[1:07:23] anyway I'd grab those reins
[1:07:27] and I would turn him
[1:07:29] are you catching it now I would turn him
[1:07:32] and then making a cutting horse out of
[1:07:35] him I could turn him and he could stand
[1:07:37] on the his back feet and turn his body
[1:07:41] we even had pictures of him standing on
[1:07:44] one foot turning in a circle
[1:07:46] he didn't learn to do that on his own
[1:07:49] we have to train him to do that
[1:07:52] now if you can do a horse like that
[1:07:56] don't tell me that the Holy Ghost can't
[1:07:58] control your nature
[1:08:01] are you with me now
[1:08:05] God renews your mind he renews it to
[1:08:09] where you speak like God
[1:08:12] he renews it to where you think like God
[1:08:16] are you with me but remember that old
[1:08:19] nature are you with me now that old
[1:08:21] nature will want you to read old things
[1:08:23] or he'll fill your mind with all
[1:08:25] different kind of all different kind of
[1:08:27] things and if you feed on that
[1:08:30] it'll make you weak in the Holy Spirit
[1:08:34] but if you feed on the word
[1:08:38] are you with me you feed on the word and
[1:08:42] the word is on the inside of you and
[1:08:45] that word washes you
[1:08:48] you'll be able to control This Old Man
[1:08:53] and this old spirit
[1:08:58] here's a scripture that set me free
[1:09:01] because Satan tries to dig up
[1:09:05] what you used to be
[1:09:07] and he tests your faith in the blood of
[1:09:10] Jesus Christ
[1:09:12] every person in this building has a
[1:09:15] history
[1:09:18] could you all raise your hand and attest
[1:09:20] to that now
[1:09:21] do you see well brother Ron I never went
[1:09:23] out in sin I'm too young to go out and
[1:09:25] sin but you were born in your first
[1:09:28] nature
[1:09:30] you were born in your first nature and
[1:09:33] it wants to have rain of your life and
[1:09:35] so like you heard last night having
[1:09:38] friends of the world listen your nature
[1:09:40] want to pull you that way
[1:09:43] but you got to grab it by the rain
[1:09:46] because we're headed in two different
[1:09:48] directions
[1:09:50] the scripture says in Romans chapter 8
[1:09:52] and verse 1 there is therefore now
[1:09:56] and if you remember this is right after
[1:09:58] Romans chapter 7 to where we're divorced
[1:10:02] of our first nature and that first
[1:10:03] nature dies and even Paul writes woe is
[1:10:07] me I'm unclean
[1:10:10] woe is me notice now but there is
[1:10:13] therefore now no condemnation
[1:10:17] to them that are in Christ Jesus who
[1:10:21] walk not after the flesh
[1:10:26] but after the spirit
[1:10:28] for the law of the spirit of life in
[1:10:31] Christ Jesus notice these words hath
[1:10:34] made me free
[1:10:38] from the law of sin and death
[1:10:44] we've said it before when Esther Was
[1:10:48] preparing to go before the king
[1:10:51] she asked the main attendant the servant
[1:10:55] of the king
[1:10:58] what does he like
[1:11:01] because notice all of the other girls
[1:11:04] and there were many of them were offered
[1:11:07] everything in the Kingdom to put on
[1:11:11] every kind of every kind of jewelry
[1:11:13] every kind of wash every kind of thing
[1:11:18] you notice this servant had been the
[1:11:21] servant to vashti
[1:11:24] and bashtai had been put away
[1:11:28] are you with me she had been the queen
[1:11:31] but at vashtai this servant had attended
[1:11:35] to Heron but there came a times where
[1:11:38] she didn't want the word
[1:11:40] she didn't want the kink
[1:11:43] she wanted to make her own choice
[1:11:45] and the King had to put her away
[1:11:48] so now he's going to select a wife out
[1:11:51] of all of these girls
[1:11:54] but she had a proper because of
[1:11:56] Mordecai's teaching find out what the
[1:11:59] king likes
[1:12:02] you remember there was a song that was
[1:12:04] written
[1:12:06] elohiser tell me more
[1:12:08] what does he look like
[1:12:10] what does he like
[1:12:13] what does he really like
[1:12:16] I preached a sermon in the old church on
[1:12:19] on Summit Avenue
[1:12:21] and and you can tell your mom I
[1:12:22] mentioned this
[1:12:23] and it was a sermon that talked about
[1:12:26] elohiser
[1:12:28] taught Rebecca what Isaac was like what
[1:12:33] he liked we needed a prophet in this day
[1:12:38] to wash us from denominational ideas and
[1:12:42] wash them for from all of that theology
[1:12:44] because we were married to a system
[1:12:48] a man-made system
[1:12:50] and as I preached that and I preached
[1:12:53] what does he like and how does he want
[1:12:55] us to dress it
[1:12:56] Christine came to me after that service
[1:12:59] and said I want to give my heart to the
[1:13:02] Lord and believe this message with all
[1:13:04] my heart I've never told that but that's
[1:13:07] quite a statement isn't it
[1:13:11] Esther asked the servant
[1:13:14] what does he want what is he like
[1:13:17] and in her purification she brought
[1:13:20] herself under submission to the king's
[1:13:23] desires
[1:13:25] all of those others walk before the king
[1:13:27] but it didn't reflect the character
[1:13:30] that he was looking for
[1:13:35] how can he turn us down
[1:13:40] how can he turn us down
[1:13:43] we've been watched by the work
[1:13:47] not just this church around the world
[1:13:51] around the world we've we've heard the
[1:13:53] word of God
[1:13:57] I think our brother George Quinn
[1:14:00] a small congregation but he's preached
[1:14:02] this message with all its heart it don't
[1:14:05] matter what the world says
[1:14:07] but he could present a group to the to
[1:14:09] the to the Rapture and prepare them for
[1:14:12] Rapture prepare them for a body change
[1:14:15] because a message got him ready
[1:14:20] are you with me now
[1:14:22] foreign
[1:14:25] I'm sorry
[1:14:30] when that King stepped out of that
[1:14:32] morning
[1:14:33] and he saw Esther
[1:14:38] he saw himself
[1:14:42] no I wanna I want you to think about
[1:14:44] this
[1:14:45] the king's choice
[1:14:49] it's either
[1:14:50] right or wrong
[1:14:55] and if you're the one before Esther
[1:14:58] and he just nods his head no
[1:15:01] it's over
[1:15:03] it's over
[1:15:04] you just become another girl in the
[1:15:06] society
[1:15:08] and then that girl
[1:15:11] watches Esther Step Up
[1:15:15] and immediately he responds that's her
[1:15:19] because she reflects
[1:15:23] the character that he's looking for
[1:15:28] the girls after him
[1:15:30] no doubt he's looked down in the aisle
[1:15:32] and now they just go back to being
[1:15:35] ladies that but Esther caught his eye
[1:15:41] are you with me or are you are you
[1:15:44] seeing where I'm at now
[1:15:46] I want to share this with you now we
[1:15:48] we've shared it we've shared it so many
[1:15:50] times but I want to share this with you
[1:15:51] this morning
[1:15:54] brother Brown I'm talking about his
[1:15:56] vision of the Bride
[1:15:58] kind of sums a lot of things up
[1:16:01] he said when this bride she was looking
[1:16:04] right
[1:16:06] the one that was talking to me I was
[1:16:08] standing there her eyes
[1:16:09] she was the cleanest sweetest looking
[1:16:12] people I ever seen in my life
[1:16:16] look like it could have been a dozen or
[1:16:20] more I don't know how many abreast but
[1:16:23] there was just a group of them and she
[1:16:26] passed by a sweet with air her eyes
[1:16:29] watching as she passed by she was
[1:16:32] beautiful and I looked at her as she
[1:16:34] passed by and I said
[1:16:36] and he said now we shall review that's
[1:16:39] the bride now we will review the
[1:16:42] churches
[1:16:44] and they come and I noticed them coming
[1:16:46] up and when they came up each one of
[1:16:48] them looked like they got worse
[1:16:51] I never seen such a filthy bunch in my
[1:16:55] life
[1:16:56] and when he said next I heard a voice
[1:16:59] and it said next and here comes the
[1:17:01] American group
[1:17:03] and I and and I am I'm an American but I
[1:17:07] I say this
[1:17:10] that made me sick
[1:17:13] I'm not eloquent enough to in a mixed
[1:17:16] audience to say what I was taking place
[1:17:19] but you'll have to read between the
[1:17:21] lines but when the women were coming the
[1:17:24] leader of them was a witch and she had a
[1:17:27] great long nose and a big mouth and all
[1:17:30] of them was dressed in some kind of a
[1:17:32] lower close down there but just the top
[1:17:35] was like a strap and just a little about
[1:17:38] a half inch strap moved right around
[1:17:41] them like this
[1:17:44] what vulgarity the prophet was seeing
[1:17:50] and when they passed by the review and
[1:17:52] stand in the back of them you could see
[1:17:54] thus they were going up in their
[1:17:56] foremost their back part and they were
[1:17:58] just acting and I said is this a church
[1:18:05] and there she went
[1:18:08] they were singing and twisting Rock and
[1:18:10] rolls you know and
[1:18:12] ever what you call going down singing
[1:18:14] and going by and said I said
[1:18:16] is that the church
[1:18:19] and I was standing there in my heart I
[1:18:23] was crying
[1:18:25] and this switch to my notion is nothing
[1:18:28] else
[1:18:30] in the world but she's that World
[1:18:33] Council of churches leaving them
[1:18:36] straight down the road where she was
[1:18:38] going and they went off to the left and
[1:18:40] disappeared into chaos still beating
[1:18:43] this music making making funny sounds
[1:18:46] shaping their bodies one side then
[1:18:49] another side like that and carrying on
[1:18:51] walking
[1:18:52] I started to bow my head and said and
[1:18:55] and he said wait
[1:18:57] the bride must come again and I looked
[1:19:00] here they come
[1:19:02] and they passed by a sweet looking
[1:19:05] little ladies and they was all going
[1:19:07] right at me and as they passed by I
[1:19:10] noticed each one of them dressed
[1:19:11] different and one in the back kind of
[1:19:13] long hair hanging down and rolled around
[1:19:15] like this she might have been German or
[1:19:18] something like that and I watched them
[1:19:21] and coming before were he was standing
[1:19:24] he he was holding a little paper in
[1:19:26] front
[1:19:28] and that's goes back to the other part
[1:19:31] I I want you to just notice just for a
[1:19:33] moment
[1:19:35] brother Branham had the opportunity to
[1:19:37] watch the church in its condition
[1:19:39] but think about 1965 where the church
[1:19:42] was
[1:19:45] think about where she was
[1:19:48] think about where she is now
[1:19:55] every year they begin to tilt off a
[1:19:58] little further off of the cliff
[1:20:02] every year Sodom has an effect on her
[1:20:07] every year the dress begins to change a
[1:20:10] little bit more
[1:20:12] every year she begins to take on new
[1:20:14] things of the world
[1:20:19] the reason is she turned the message
[1:20:21] down
[1:20:23] are you with me she had a chance at the
[1:20:25] word but she turned it down
[1:20:29] not just in this day but look what
[1:20:31] happened in Luther's age the Revival
[1:20:34] went forth men got a hold of it and
[1:20:36] denominated listen to Lutheran Churches
[1:20:39] nowhere near what it was when Luther was
[1:20:42] here
[1:20:43] when John Wesley was here it was a
[1:20:46] mighty move of God and a lot of
[1:20:48] Ministries went out for it powerful but
[1:20:51] it denominated
[1:20:53] it denominated and died
[1:20:57] and every year she begins to Eclipse
[1:20:59] into a different Realm
[1:21:02] Pentecost today
[1:21:05] I'm not talking about it I'm not talking
[1:21:07] about Acts 2 Pentecost but Azusa
[1:21:10] Pentecost
[1:21:11] she's a far cry
[1:21:15] she's a far cry from where she was
[1:21:22] listen when brother Branham was
[1:21:24] preaching to him he said every year I
[1:21:25] come back I see more Bobcat women
[1:21:29] if he could see it today
[1:21:32] if you could see their dress today
[1:21:34] listen don't let don't think I'm being
[1:21:36] hard here
[1:21:37] I'm just calling it how it is
[1:21:39] but if you could see the church today
[1:21:41] where she's at
[1:21:45] I I've got a reason to preach like this
[1:21:47] if he could see where she's at
[1:21:50] five wise and five foolish
[1:21:54] but notice the bride came back into
[1:21:56] review again
[1:21:58] and what he preached
[1:22:01] what he delivered
[1:22:03] about 1200 love letters is in physical
[1:22:07] frame now
[1:22:08] it's sitting in flesh saying amen amen
[1:22:13] amen amen amen amen
[1:22:23] listen this message isn't for everybody
[1:22:28] you know we're not going to force the
[1:22:31] message on you whatsoever
[1:22:32] but this message is for the Bride of
[1:22:34] Jesus Christ
[1:22:37] and God must have a wife
[1:22:40] in this generation and she's here
[1:22:44] the bride's Revival is wrong
[1:22:47] and the focus of why I'm preaching this
[1:22:50] God
[1:22:51] has a bride here that can take a rapture
[1:22:57] I want to say this to you we're here
[1:23:07] what's going on in the denominal world
[1:23:09] has no effect on us
[1:23:14] they made their choices
[1:23:17] does that mean they're going to hell no
[1:23:18] Every Man Has to stand in the judgment
[1:23:20] and God's going to give Grace
[1:23:22] thank God for God to give Grace to good
[1:23:24] people I got great friends there
[1:23:27] but they've been deceived
[1:23:30] by a system
[1:23:32] by programs by Creeds and dogmas
[1:23:37] you're watching by the way of Internet
[1:23:39] pay close attention just now the layout
[1:23:42] I see an age was found themselves they
[1:23:46] found that they didn't have a need of
[1:23:48] nothing but they were naked
[1:23:51] and blind and miserable and poor
[1:23:57] a church filled with money a church is
[1:24:00] filled with gold church is filled with
[1:24:02] people
[1:24:04] but I read an article just yesterday
[1:24:06] that said we can't hold our people
[1:24:08] anymore we can't hold that's why
[1:24:10] churches are are shutting down we don't
[1:24:13] have an issue
[1:24:15] the Bride of Jesus Christ doesn't have
[1:24:17] that issue she's growing
[1:24:22] not just in numbers but she's growing in
[1:24:25] character
[1:24:27] are you with me now and the longer this
[1:24:30] thing goes the more pure you look
[1:24:37] the less like Sodom you look like
[1:24:45] are you with me
[1:24:49] but I asked who is going to be
[1:24:51] responsible for leading those people
[1:24:53] into
[1:24:58] the tribulation period
[1:25:01] brother Brown said there's
[1:25:02] disappointments at the judgment
[1:25:05] he said now
[1:25:07] that drunk won't be disappointed he
[1:25:09] knows what he did
[1:25:10] he said that prostitute won't be
[1:25:13] disappointed she knows what she did but
[1:25:16] the people that will be disappointed
[1:25:18] will be people that said in churches
[1:25:23] and their Pastor deceived them telling
[1:25:27] them they're all right
[1:25:30] now now let me just go back here just
[1:25:33] for a moment because a story always
[1:25:36] solidifies things and helps you to see
[1:25:38] it
[1:25:39] brother random had a girl in his church
[1:25:41] that refused
[1:25:43] to come under the word she she just
[1:25:45] didn't want it
[1:25:47] but I want you to notice now and she
[1:25:49] goes to another church she leaves her
[1:25:52] husband she goes to another church
[1:25:54] you know you know and by the the nominal
[1:25:56] system she's you know she's all of that
[1:26:00] and and yet she she goes to a church and
[1:26:03] she becomes a musician she becomes a
[1:26:05] Sunday school teacher
[1:26:07] but that didn't cleanse her
[1:26:09] this is a real story and she leaves that
[1:26:12] husband goes to another church same
[1:26:15] thing happens and she and brother bam
[1:26:17] uses the term Jim and John said she
[1:26:19] marries another man
[1:26:21] then she marries another man
[1:26:24] listen she had religion
[1:26:27] and it was covering her
[1:26:30] and religion didn't clean her up
[1:26:34] but when it came or time to die she dies
[1:26:36] a young woman and she called for who
[1:26:40] brother Branham
[1:26:42] and said her pastor was standing there
[1:26:44] consoling her that everything would be
[1:26:46] all right but she was telling him you've
[1:26:50] deceived me
[1:26:52] and she wants brother Branham to come
[1:26:54] but he doesn't get there soon enough
[1:26:57] brother Branham uses a term he said she
[1:26:59] had grieved her soul away
[1:27:03] but when it came time to die her soul
[1:27:06] came back
[1:27:10] listen I don't want that to be my
[1:27:12] testimony
[1:27:13] I don't want that to be my testimony at
[1:27:16] the end of the road I've turned the word
[1:27:18] down and lived any kind of life but I
[1:27:20] knowed what was true
[1:27:22] listen you you can't deceive your heart
[1:27:24] but so much your heart knows what's true
[1:27:30] you know what's the truth
[1:27:36] young people's sin is pleasurable for a
[1:27:39] season
[1:27:40] but you know what's the truth
[1:27:47] I wish I could just I wish I could just
[1:27:49] drive this point you know what's the
[1:27:52] truth
[1:27:53] and in my wildest ugliest days I knew
[1:27:57] what was the truth
[1:27:58] and the worst fight that I ever got in
[1:28:01] was when a man in a bar room called
[1:28:04] William Branham a false prophet
[1:28:07] it was not pretty
[1:28:11] it was not pretty and I'm listen I'm
[1:28:14] halfway ashamed of that but thank God
[1:28:16] even in that condition I stood up for
[1:28:19] this message
[1:28:28] are you with me listen you can hear this
[1:28:31] word this word will never leave you
[1:28:34] this word will never leave you but let
[1:28:37] me just say if you do the right thing
[1:28:40] every day
[1:28:42] you may have to tell some of your
[1:28:43] friends I can't do that
[1:28:46] I can't do that they may make fun of you
[1:28:49] that's okay
[1:28:51] that's okay
[1:28:54] all those other girls go out in the
[1:28:57] world but you get chosen by the Queen
[1:28:59] the king of Heaven
[1:29:00] it's okay to get turned down here
[1:29:06] it's okay to be made fun of him it's
[1:29:09] okay for people to put shame on you here
[1:29:12] but we ought to call that royalty gold
[1:29:15] it's good for us
[1:29:19] it's actually a compliment to us
[1:29:22] [Applause]
[1:29:33] brother Brandon tells a story and I
[1:29:35] think it's so incredible
[1:29:40] that he picks up a story
[1:29:42] and tells it about an armor and Company
[1:29:46] son
[1:29:47] going to look at a ranch
[1:29:51] house
[1:29:52] they actually owned the place but he's
[1:29:55] going there he's looking for a wife he
[1:29:57] said he couldn't find none in Chicago
[1:30:01] now listen he's rich
[1:30:03] armor company goes a long way back
[1:30:06] and they're wealthy
[1:30:08] I was in the I was a meat cutter for
[1:30:10] seven years
[1:30:11] and God rich in Mercy I didn't have to
[1:30:13] be a meat cutter forever
[1:30:15] but evidently I am now
[1:30:18] but anyway
[1:30:21] he couldn't find a wife with all the
[1:30:23] money and all the prestige you couldn't
[1:30:24] find a wife in Chicago
[1:30:26] so he goes he goes into
[1:30:29] and the foreman has all of his daughters
[1:30:31] to prepare a party
[1:30:33] you know and they dance and you know
[1:30:36] they dress up just like all the girls in
[1:30:37] Chicago
[1:30:40] you know he stayed inside for a while
[1:30:43] but after a bit he walks outside and
[1:30:45] he's standing at the Corral
[1:30:47] and there was a girl
[1:30:49] that was throwing out dishwater
[1:30:54] and he saw her
[1:30:57] and he begins to talk to her
[1:31:00] and as he begins to talk to her he finds
[1:31:02] character of what he's looking for
[1:31:07] and as he's talking to her he realizes
[1:31:11] this is the one
[1:31:13] it wasn't in there this is the one the
[1:31:16] man said there she stood in no shoes
[1:31:19] barefooted
[1:31:21] she didn't have a frilly dress on
[1:31:24] had a dish pan in her hand
[1:31:27] and she was an orphaned girl
[1:31:30] and this man makes her a promise
[1:31:34] and he tells her why I have came to find
[1:31:38] character I find character in you
[1:31:42] I find character in you
[1:31:46] and at the end at the end they don't
[1:31:49] chase her around the church Thomas
[1:31:53] or Homer
[1:31:55] but he reaches over and kisses her on
[1:31:58] the cheek
[1:32:03] and he seals his conversation with a
[1:32:05] kiss
[1:32:07] that'll give us a license to do that but
[1:32:09] he seals it with a kiss that she knows
[1:32:13] he means business
[1:32:16] that's why God gives you the Holy Ghost
[1:32:20] because he knows you can't do it on your
[1:32:22] own so he comes and lives on the inside
[1:32:25] of you and seals himself inside of you
[1:32:28] and it will produce the character of
[1:32:31] Jesus Christ in you and it'll be like a
[1:32:35] fountain Floyd
[1:32:38] because you can't wash yourself
[1:32:41] you can't clean yourself up you can't
[1:32:45] move past the old chapters of your book
[1:32:50] you knew what Ruth was like you knew
[1:32:52] what Esther was like you knew what all
[1:32:54] those was like you know what yourself
[1:32:56] was like but if the blood of Jesus
[1:32:59] Christ
[1:33:02] Crystal it's the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:33:04] is truly applied you're not that person
[1:33:07] no more
[1:33:09] [Applause]
[1:33:19] now she goes and tells the story
[1:33:22] incredible story
[1:33:24] they make fun of her
[1:33:27] for a year she tells this story
[1:33:30] for a year she's making a wedding dress
[1:33:32] for a year she's preparing because he
[1:33:35] made a promise
[1:33:38] brother Branham would say later in
[1:33:40] another place he said he watched you for
[1:33:42] that year
[1:33:45] listen he's watching us now
[1:33:50] he's watching us now he's seeing this
[1:33:54] bride he's Among Us the mighty Angel is
[1:33:58] Among Us accompanied in US
[1:34:01] what do you feel when you come into this
[1:34:03] building you don't feel that at Walmart
[1:34:06] you don't feel that at your favorite
[1:34:07] restaurant you feel his presence when
[1:34:10] you come when you get up in the morning
[1:34:12] you begin to pray and that warm passage
[1:34:15] comes in he's watching you now
[1:34:19] he's saying that this he's going to
[1:34:23] finish this
[1:34:24] [Music]
[1:34:27] I want to drive this
[1:34:29] they made fun of her and the last day
[1:34:32] I want you to think about this some of
[1:34:34] the things that you're doing right now
[1:34:36] you're doing them for the last time
[1:34:40] can I drill this just for a minute she
[1:34:43] made their breakfast last time
[1:34:47] she cleaned their table
[1:34:49] last time
[1:34:51] she washed her clothes last time
[1:34:57] are you with me I'm not too far off and
[1:35:00] this story's not too far off Ruth picked
[1:35:02] the pick those those that up the last
[1:35:05] times
[1:35:06] she wouldn't always do it she was going
[1:35:08] to be a queen
[1:35:10] Esther wouldn't always be out there
[1:35:12] among the women she was getting ready to
[1:35:14] be the queen
[1:35:16] We're Not Gonna always be here
[1:35:24] all right
[1:35:26] this church will be filled with cobwebs
[1:35:29] one of these days
[1:35:30] it'll be a place that just people will
[1:35:33] go by and said something happened to
[1:35:34] those people I'm going to tell you what
[1:35:36] the something happened was
[1:35:38] the promise that he made us and he
[1:35:41] sealed it with a kiss
[1:35:44] he confirmed his promise he changed
[1:35:48] their bodies we heard a message that
[1:35:51] prepared us for the rapture
[1:35:56] that message indicted this
[1:35:58] denominational generation it indicted
[1:36:01] these preachers it told us Souls now in
[1:36:04] prison it says why I'm not a
[1:36:06] denomination why I'm not tossed about
[1:36:08] this message called us out
[1:36:12] and what they didn't want we said yes
[1:36:15] [Music]
[1:36:15] [Applause]
[1:36:16] yes
[1:36:30] I believe it
[1:36:32] yes in the Philippines yes in South
[1:36:34] Africa yes in China
[1:36:38] yes all over the world
[1:36:39] [Applause]
[1:36:41] the Holy Ghost brought a bride out
[1:36:44] and she stands a bride adorned for her
[1:36:47] husband
[1:36:50] that woman walks out
[1:36:52] the girl walks out with her wedding
[1:36:53] dress on and brother Brandon said that's
[1:36:56] when the persecution set in
[1:37:00] when it's now more than a story more
[1:37:02] than a testimony
[1:37:04] but when she's dressed
[1:37:09] when she's dressed all them cousins
[1:37:13] really start making fun
[1:37:22] you know who I feel for and I'm gonna
[1:37:24] drop this
[1:37:25] you know who I feel for the most
[1:37:28] it's not the Baptist or the Methodist
[1:37:31] the Presbyterian or Pentecostals
[1:37:33] it's for people that have set in in cues
[1:37:40] and fault preachers while he preached
[1:37:44] sent negative vibes
[1:37:47] tried to brush the message off
[1:37:50] and then they watch their loved ones get
[1:37:53] a body change
[1:37:58] foreign
[1:38:09] I'm going to say that again
[1:38:12] I don't feel sorry for the Baptist the
[1:38:14] Methodist the Presbyterian Pentecostals
[1:38:16] they're headed for the tribulation
[1:38:18] period
[1:38:19] and let me just explain to you in a one
[1:38:21] sentence of the prophet he said the
[1:38:23] tribulation period And he says
[1:38:26] incredible thing here
[1:38:28] you that's watching them by the way of
[1:38:30] the internet let God deal with your
[1:38:32] heart right now make a move

[1:38:51] these people didn't move four hours here
[1:38:53] leave their jobs leave their homes
[1:38:55] listen it was difficult what they had to
[1:38:58] do but this message was more important
[1:39:04] how many hours did you move
[1:39:08] this guy moved 13 hours because he was
[1:39:11] down praying and God told them to move
[1:39:13] here

[1:39:16] home they left their job

[1:39:39] of places that don't have a pastor that
[1:39:41] listens to this word every weekend
[1:39:45] not just ours but other brother Donnie
[1:39:47] brother Tim listens to the word of the
[1:39:49] hour

[1:40:29] I was too tired but I listened to
[1:40:31] everything you said and I got pages of
[1:40:33] notes from your sermon
[1:40:36] just because I'm home I didn't lay there
[1:40:38] and goof off
[1:40:40] this message is too important to miss

[1:40:56] one son's in Ohio pouring his heart out
[1:40:59] and the other son is standing here
[1:41:03] and I thought about
[1:41:05] this is what this message has produced

[1:41:15] is the most important part of the week
[1:41:22] listen this is living proof
[1:41:27] don't get quiet now
[1:41:30] you ought to say amen and thank God for
[1:41:32] it

[1:41:37] but I watched Isaac
[1:41:40] I watched your daughter they said second
[1:41:43] third row in Ohio

[1:42:22] dropping
[1:42:26] it is thin everybody will believe this
[1:42:29] message was right
[1:42:31] God did send the prophet God did prepare
[1:42:35] us God didn't get us ready
[1:42:37] [Applause]
[1:42:55] their laughter
[1:42:57] stopped
[1:43:04] and he stopped at the fence
[1:43:08] at the gate
[1:43:11] and took her
[1:43:13] and said I've been watching you all year
[1:43:16] long
[1:43:19] and you believe me
[1:43:22] and you got yourself ready
[1:43:32] here's why I wanted you here Marcus
[1:43:36] it doesn't matter the difficulty of 20
[1:43:38] years
[1:43:40] that book is over
[1:43:45] I want that to be sounding everywhere
[1:43:48] I told Marcus a story about being on a
[1:43:51] plane for 20 years
[1:43:54] looking for that man
[1:43:57] and then God
[1:44:01] maybe somebody hasn't seen this
[1:44:03] but Marcus will you stand
[1:44:06] can you get a picture of him
[1:44:11] I was on an airplane
[1:44:14] over 20 years ago thank you
[1:44:20] and I'm just going to tell a very short
[1:44:21] version
[1:44:23] he said my life is a mess my life is a
[1:44:26] complete mess but I was raised in the
[1:44:28] message I was raised in a message I'm
[1:44:30] gonna tell this for a reason I was
[1:44:32] raised in the message and he told me
[1:44:34] told me about the squirrels
[1:44:37] you're talking about had it right he
[1:44:39] told me enough to know that I was raised
[1:44:42] I'm not fooling but my life is a mess we
[1:44:46] get off of the plane
[1:44:47] and I want to spend some time with him
[1:44:50] here 20 years later and I've told that
[1:44:52] in conventions
[1:44:54] looking for that seed
[1:44:58] but I'm not the one
[1:45:00] that is supposed to find it
[1:45:04] I was just looking for the end of the
[1:45:06] story
[1:45:08] are you with me God don't forget
[1:45:14] God don't forget
[1:45:16] and here we are 20 some years later and
[1:45:20] we're sitting down here with the family
[1:45:22] you're sitting there watching it as it
[1:45:26] took place
[1:45:28] and God speaks in my ear the man on the
[1:45:32] airplane
[1:45:34] the man on the airplane is sitting
[1:45:36] beside of you
[1:45:39] now listen let me just say this to you
[1:45:41] God puts you in some pretty difficult
[1:45:43] spots
[1:45:46] Friday night he put me in a spot
[1:45:51] I'm getting ready to make an
[1:45:52] illustration and I call a boy sitting on
[1:45:55] this side of the building and I call him
[1:45:57] he's a curly-headed boy good-looking guy
[1:45:59] he's a curly-headed boy and he steps up
[1:46:02] on the stage and I'm going to call him
[1:46:03] for an illustration one in a million and
[1:46:07] I'm calling him for an illustration and
[1:46:09] when he gets me or God's got another
[1:46:11] plan
[1:46:12] I can't make myself do this
[1:46:15] I can't be wrong
[1:46:18] and God tells him his story
[1:46:21] standing right there in front of him and
[1:46:24] he starts screaming that's the truth
[1:46:25] that's the truth that's the truth and it
[1:46:27] begins to scream
[1:46:29] and I notice now we're in a moment
[1:46:34] me and this boy is in a moment his
[1:46:37] family hates the message but he's
[1:46:39] standing there for a reason
[1:46:41] he's Kim to Wayne Lawson and their
[1:46:44] family he's a cousin there's people
[1:46:46] sitting in the building going that's
[1:46:48] absolutely the truth that's absolutely
[1:46:50] the truth that's absolutely the truth
[1:46:54] God knows how to find you
[1:46:58] God knows how to find you
[1:47:00] listen your temporary testimony is only
[1:47:03] temporary but that seed is eternal you
[1:47:08] may have to go through a lot of
[1:47:09] persecution you may be made fun of a lot
[1:47:11] you may be ashamed of a lot of things
[1:47:13] but that seed God will not lose one
