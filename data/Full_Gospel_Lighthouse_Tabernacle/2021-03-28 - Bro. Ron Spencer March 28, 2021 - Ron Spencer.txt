love him with all of my heart don't take it for granted never take a sermon for granted never take what's going to transpire here today for granted there's a lot of people all over the world because

amen maybe you can have a seat just a moment i just have a couple comments i want to share with you and so good to see you amen what a service last night amen i told andrew that was the creme de creme amen i saw it happening and i saw it it looked like a storm you know the other day i was i was sister connie and i was on the weather weather channel and those when those storms were getting ready to break out there was a storm that was about 200 miles on the ground or about 100 miles or so on the ground and we just happened to be watching that weather channel on earth deal there as it was starting to happen and you could just he just said this is going to be a bad one and it just said look at it last night as i was sitting right there i watched that storm just starting to happen right here i thought oh god fill our hearts amen and so we just i andrew that was the best one that was the best one yet and so what an anointing i believe the lord just came and filled our filled his place amen we are so glad to have sister deborah's sister here with us we've known each other since we were kids and so we're so glad to have you with us this weekend and thank you for bringing your atmosphere to our services and so thank you for being here we're not going to tell you how long ago we were kids amen amen so god bless you we're so glad to have brother wiggum and sister gabrielle and their family back they have been they've been gone to his fathers and then down to brother tim's for a few days and spent some time with michael and bethany and their family and and her dad and and so we i'm just thankful for what god's done for her dad and amen i love the transforming power of god of what he's done there and and so glad to have you back let me say i missed you and uh we we're so glad to have you back and amen it's good to us brother nate brother nathaniel uh where and sister sue they have moved into new jobs and they're they're here every weekend and so we're just so happy to have him yeah especially i we love to have you too sister sue but but to be on on a on a decent schedule to where you're able to be here and and so we just are so glad that that has happened for you i want you to remember sister anne she's had her knee replaced and and that's just a just a vicious surgery as many of you know and pray that god would just touch her in a supernatural way and minister to her brother donnie last night the service in the service gave a testimony and it was absolutely i understand some of those things and i my heart just felt that big when you when you gave your testimony last night and we're just so glad to have you back with us and what an incredible gifted you are here at the body of jesus christ amen we were asked to do a funeral this week and and uh for for those that know or don't know there was a girl 25 years old she actually grew up here in this church brother charlie and and granddaughter amanda was her mother's name but she she grew up here set about right there uh in the services and she grew up and and uh then i got a call out of the blue one day that she wanted to get married and i think she was between 15 16 years old when she got married and i performed the ceremony before church one night and uh it was a full-blown deal i didn't realize what it was going to be she was in her wedding gown and he was in a nice little suit there and they had flowers and everything and and we married them and stepped out on the out on the porch and some of you were coming in for the service and and we just had a wedding here and so i i had not heard a word from them for for 10 years and i didn't know it but this last week she died in in martha jefferson university and they asked me to do the funeral we haven't done a funeral inside since the covid situation so i offered yesterday was a very beautiful day and so i offered to preach the funeral on the steps and so they they were motorcycle people and so and so we had a about between 20 and 30 harley-davidson's parked across the front and we had enough tattoos here yesterday we had enough tattoos here to to put on a big billboard somewhere another and uh and so i just preached to them jesus that's all i knew to preach and i preached to them jesus and so we want to pray for that family that god would do a work for them let me just say let me let me just be very clear with this you can live in the church door and miss it and as i stood on the steps i thought about the grace of god and uh here's a thought that i can't i i i got up with it yesterday morning because i think i think kind of deeply about some of these things it didn't have to be this way it didn't hurt you'd you shouldn't have to die because of a dirty heroin needle you know it just didn't have to be this way and and i and i want to say this to our young people if your friends are trying to pull you into that world they're not your friends and so i i'm not throwing a stone and i'm not being judgmental but it don't have to be that way and there's a better life and i would say there's a better life and so we just thank god for his mercy and his grace amen amen we've been about a year now in our journey with with the diagnosis of cancer it takes a lot of funny turns and then it's turned sometimes there's good days bad days uh sometimes there's good weeks and sometimes there's bad weeks this week was a very weary week i would say the weariness of of the journey has kind of been a little difficult over the last couple of weeks i actually see the cancer doctor tomorrow and so if you would pray for that but you know god knows how to do things and somebody knowed how to do something very special and i i'd like to share it with you this morning if i could maybe brother andrew and brother brother matthew brother william and brother matthew will you will you come and hold this up for me [Laughter] hallelujah now you know you can turn the set off whatever you want to do but i'm a preacher that loves boxing and so now i've got a belt not this modern day stuff now but but somebody i don't know who it is if you'll come forward or tell me or whatever i'd like to thank you very much but the other day i got boxes in the mail and i i took it in i said what's connie ordered she's ordered a belt and so i you know sometimes i do a sneak preview and just check what we've got and so i thought well this is a thick belt and so i opened it up and it was in a bag and i was probably feeling as weary as i've ever felt in my life and i pull this belt out and it says undefeated champion ronald dean spencer [Applause] devil defeater i will not accept nothing but full victory and psalms 91 that's my favorite scripture and show no mercy to whoever we give you a great big hand thank you [Applause] the only amendment i would make was jesus christ is my champion today amen god bless you god bless you whoever did it amen you're not it you're going not going to tell me but god bless you we love you with all of our hearts and i'm glad that i've got many friends in the world that love us and so amen he's good to us amen you can imagine how these boys up here told me to come out and show you my belt and they had me dancing with it and over my shoulders and and maybe on a day where i feel a little better i may dance with it a little bit or so amen if you will help me this morning and preaching today i actually called in sick and they didn't take it so amen we love you with all of our hearts and we'd like to say happy easter to you and this is a great week and we remember the resurrection and we're looking at the body change and we're getting ready to step into it and so amen god bless you i apologize for taking a few minutes but now you know why i wanted you to be seated for a moment let's stand to our feet this morning i'd like for you to turn with me to john chapter 20 and verse 11. and i have a subject i just won't i i don't think i'll be long but i just want to share with you on my heart that's especially after last night's happenings i feel even more so last week we we spoke on the woman that washed jesus's feet and we we we talked about jesus being in the room and he was in the room here last week he was in the room last night that was a wonderful song he was in the room and and sometimes in speaking a sermon like last week it gets sticky for just a few minutes on on who has who who we're impressed with and so and so we you know and we just named a few occupations of things that people are impressed with that jesus wasn't impressed with you understand that that jesus wasn't impressed with now i want to take you to another lady today mary magdalene and this is a subject that i've just been very cautious about how i deal with her because she's she's she's actually named more and matthew mark luke and john than any other woman was named in those four books mary magdalene was named more than any other woman so she has an important place amen saint john chapter 20 and verse 11. are you are you there with me this morning amen but mary stood without at the sepulcher weeping and as she wept she stooped down and looked into the sepulchre and seeth two angels in the white city the one at the at the head and the other at the feet where the body of jesus had lain and they said unto her woman why weepest thou she said unto them because they have taken away my lord and i know not where they have laid him and when she had thus said she turned herself back and saw jesus standing and knew not that it was jesus and jesus saith unto her woman why weepest thou whom seek us thou and she supposed him to be the gardener and saith unto him sir if thou had borne him hence tell me where thou has laid him and i will take him away and jesus saith unto her mary and she turned herself and saith unto him rapona which is to say master and jesus saith unto her touch me not for i am not yet ascended to my father but go to my brethren and say unto them i ascend unto my father and your father and to my god and your god mary magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the lord and that he had spoken these things unto her you may be seated may the lord bless the reading of his word amen is everybody comfortable amen it's good to a sydney brother branham says this and and he quotes history i'll take brother brandon's quote in history he said after mary magdalene said my history run before them and said what has he done what evil did he do she stopped the possession and said what did he do was evil what did he do that was evil has he done nothing but preached the gospel to the poor has he done nothing but healed the sick and raised the dead the very signs of the living god is in him he could condemn you and they slapped her in the mouth and said would you listen to the ill-famed woman in the stead of your priest there you are your bishop there you are same thing today that's right yes now when he done all of this and he proved himself and what he was and and put it down to them and said if if i'm not he then who are you if you can condemn me of sin if i'm anywhere wrong in the word you show me brother branham was more than just quoting history i want 100 participation he was doing more than quoting history sin is unbelief they had to get rid of him out of their sight now to get rid of them out of their sight they hated him so bad because he tore up their organizations to rid him out of their sight they buried him and rolled a great big denominational stone over the door so he would be sure not to rise up again as we look at this week and we look at it in history there's no way in the world that we can rebuild and bring to you the mind of the atmosphere that was taken place in the government of that day in the church world of that day the atmosphere of calling for his his crucifixion the atmosphere that you would beat a body a human body like that they would loose on him and beat jesus to where he was unrecognizable as a human being and yet with him standing there with those with those incredible stripes on him and a crown of thorns on his head the church world chose barabbas over jesus [Applause] you think of the insanity he raised their dead he healed their sick he fed their thousands are you with me he had no home he had no church are you with me there was no army that was marching against rome or the sanhedrin council the pharisees and the sadducees the holy people he fulfilled every prophecy in the old testament he fulfilled it and they refused to recognize of what god was doing i'd say we're there again [Applause] i'd say we're at a supercharged moment again of the atmosphere where they've crucified the word our politicians are ashamed of of a painting of moses over top of them this week they're trying to get rid of the picture of moses in the hall of congress well they kicked him out of the schools they've done away with the bibles in the schools they've done away with the ten commandments they want no real prayer in our in our in our in our washington we're the nation we're the nation that the prophet of god came out of we were a christian nation not now we don't have that same identity now i am an american i'm proud to be an american this is where i was born brother graham said i am i stand with her in her glory and i stand with her inner shame but do you remember the last vision was that she was bombed so she's not an end time player so don't get comfortable with the america that you even have now [Music] [Applause] there's a rapture that's to come don't miss it woman that comes out and stops the possession and she begins to scream what hath he done what hath he done what hath he done and they slap her they do away with her they're taking the lamb of god up on the hill to be hung on a cruel tree the greatest preacher that ever lived i think about it as i thought about it the last couple of weeks of all the believers that's ever been on the face of the earth god chose that woman i want to just gather your mind here just for a few moments in god's pre-planning in his infinite bible in the book of redemption he chooses mary magdalene to fulfill the word in so many places listen in the scripture god's not deity about the book of redemption he's chose women like rahab he's chose ruth he's chosen tamar he's chose these women of extreme ill fame to show us redemption oh now don't you get your angel wings on just for a moment all have sinned and come short of the glory of god your righteousness is as filthy rags and you were on your way to hell don't get yourself all piety for a moment listen without the blood of jesus christ you are going to hell scripture said sin is pleasurable for a season and here was a woman that was caught up because of circumstances of life we don't have too much of her history but the scripture talks about in history talks about it that she had seven demons an interesting number of demons and a prophet of god would come back and call out those demons and say what they were he said first of all she was a beautiful woman he said well brother on how did brother branham know that i'd say the same way he watched eve walk out of the garden of eden history tells us she was a beautiful woman brother branham said that she didn't even know that she had those demons i wonder how many times that people have demons in their life that lay deeply in there and they don't realize that they have demons there and it's just part of life i want to just labor this just for a moment if you will help me and you don't know if they're there until they show their face brother man said he would be preaching along and all of a sudden the countenance on people's faces would change and then they would show what they were and he said there would be and listen they're sitting in the pew they're sitting quietly and don't realize they're showing the dimension that they're feeding on sometimes if we're we're not careful we become religious and not converted there's a major difference between religious and not and converted it's two different things nicodemus was religious the woman at the well was religious and many people are religious today and they want jesus but it's a jesus of their own making. let me just give you a couple of demons that you'll know jealousy is a real green-eyed devil it won't show its color until it's put under pressure and yet it can live in some of the greatest christians and under pressure it'll come out and show its viciousness it destroys homes it destroys families it destroys marriages sure he does now your wife and husband should be your best friend in life if they're not your best friend you married the wrong person that's not my fault that's yours but your wife you guys are getting married in a few months it's coming quick you're getting married in a eight weeks nine weeks i don't have to tell you all that business but that's your best friend that's your best friend you're sitting beside your best friend brother steve and there should be supreme trust an absolute supreme trust in in you between you as mates you don't have to hold a gun to each other and go now don't you commit adultery day don't you lust don't you do anything don't are you with me now listen it would drive me crazy if i had to tell connie everywhere i was at at every moment of the day she's calling me a hundred times a day and texting me a thousand times a day first of all i couldn't live in that kind of environment first time she gets a call says we bought a truck need you to come sign for it did i ask her permission no i bought a gun this week did a caller up and say hey uh you know i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna buy a gun first of all i can afford to do that i'm not crazy one of the boxes she had bought a pair of shoes so i felt it was okay to buy a gun this woman was a harlot she probably wouldn't have been welcome in any of the local churches let's just say it how it is she probably wouldn't welcome with any of the priests it probably wasn't welcome just like the woman at the well wasn't welcome with the water just like the woman that washed jesus's feet she she was no doubt not welcome in a lot of places but yet she was beautiful you know beauty beauty can be a curse it can be a curse but it can be a great thing amen beauty fades ugly lives on and on when i think about this woman i think about god's bride in this world had a lot of demons that was in the first nature and i'd say all of you could could go back real quick in your mind some of the things that ruled your life because you either serve god or you serve the devil and so in your first marriage to your first nature there was a lot of things that controlled your life a lot of things controlled you and they controlled you and you thought that's who you were but then jesus came and you think of the greatest preacher that would ever live of all of humanity's numbers he's going to meet a woman we all know the names peter james john bartholomew all of the the men disciples and what they're going to do and the purpose that they're going to have but this woman god's going to specifically use with purpose and when he finds her she's got seven devils that is controlling her life but jesus knows there's a gene seed of life that's laying on the inside of her and all of that other stuff is not hurt all of that other stuff that you were contaminated with that wasn't you but you came from god and you came through that that sexual birth and a lot of demons attracted itself to your flesh and god in your spirit and jesus turns it around to nicodemus the most religious man and said you must be born again [Applause] are you with me born again is dying to that first nature of course we know the real prescription is repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of the lord jesus christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for this promises and to you and to your children as many as afar off you're not even the same man you used to be how long does it take for this woman when she met jesus she was different in the very moment in the very moment because god's greater than every devil in hell and as i was sitting in my office this morning and i was looking at these notes and i said i want to remind you satan that god's greater than the strongest cancer devil in all of hell i want to just take you just for just a bit because mary magdalene is seen many times in the scriptures with jesus peter is there and he's been a fisherman when god found him he was he was in a quite bad situation there's a doctor there's a tax collector even a lawyer he found them all and he said follow me but here is 12 disciples and a woman brother jim if you can imagine seeing jesus in his congregation you know those guys they can put a robe on they're not naked no more they're away from their family and they're following jesus but here's a woman following him this woman has been one of the filthiest human beings to ever live i don't know if i can say it just right but she's been the gutter she's been the armpit of society but jesus is going to use her as a testimony of the redemption power of almighty god can i say it can i say it like it needs to be said you as sisters are not a second class there should be shouting in the room you are not a lower grade of society you are a reflection of the queen of heaven are you with me it's because of stupid men and perverted preachers that have tried to place women in a second class and push her down but let me just say this to you a woman in her right spot reflects the glory of heaven [Applause] [Music] hallelujah she can show purity she can show character she can show passion she can show humility brother ron but women can't preach don't tell me that our sisters preach sermons and krogers in walmart in the bank in this church they preach thousands of sermons a day by their dress by their conduct by the way they do business hallelujah don't get resentful with brothers with me on that deal you showed your character when you married your wife that's what brother brown said in choosing of a bride he said you showed the real inside of you i don't mind saying it where'd she go i like to have sister connie on my arm i like to walk down the street and hold her hand i'm proud of her i've heard him say look at that old guy with that woman i was checking in in memphis one time at the at the airport and i was down taking care of my luggage and the man said what's it like to travel with your daddy that's okay are you with me now i tell her every day she's beautiful you should too not connie [Laughter] show my jealousy well brother ron you know i'm afraid i'll build her up she'll get big headed [Applause] valentine's day is not the only day to tell your wife how beautiful she is and how much that you love her i'm preaching now i'm preaching right to you it's not the only day to get a card and say i love you honey i love you more it should be a daily event of a love affair between you and your wife brother ron you're just talking about natural no i'm talking about your husband to jesus [Applause] you need to spend some time every day telling him how much you love him how much you care for him how glad you are to serve in this kingdom thank you for your grace thank you for your mercy thank you for your kindness in my life thank you for preserving me i was worthy of hell thank you [Applause] uh jesus instructed mary magdalene to prepare precious ointments he don't just call you for you to sit in a service he's got a job for you to do she was more than the woman delivered of seven demons mary magdalene is going to be one of the re greatest representatives of jesus christ he needs somebody to come and tell the resurrection and of all of his congregation he picks her i want you to think about this just real quickly paul the world he picked you that's mind-boggling that's rainbow to the world i'm a nobody but to god i'm somebody and you say that to yourself just real quickly loud enough that you can hear yourself to the world i'm a nobody but to god i'm a symbol now we've got 2 000 years of history between us and then but there was a lot of pressure for her to visit the tomb of all of the people with mary her mother and joanna all of the people that were selected to come to the tomb guards there they're still gambling people are still under greater of great things listen even the pressure on the soldiers once they find out the body's missing they come up with a story and are told to tell the story if they could come back now that money that they were told to tell a lie about jesus is being stolen it's not worth a hill of beings are you with me the money that judas got to tell where jesus was at doesn't mean nothing but in history it will be the money that was given to tell where jesus was at i wonder how many brother branham said elvis presley sold out for a fleet of cadillacs and popularity that won't mean nothing in eternity that won't mean nothing in eternity somebody may be watching today and you're making choices in your life the wrong kind of mate won't mean nothing in eternity beauty won't mean nothing in eternity jobs that take you away from god won't mean nothing won't mean nothing you ever walk through a graveyard and you see dates on there maybe a little subscription a date they don't tell nothing about their story some of them is over 100 years old they live their life it's gone and only what they did for jesus will matter [Applause] it don't say that they owned the bank it don't say that they owned the story don't oh somebody help me preach right here [Applause] it don't say that they were a basketball star it won't say on the day of judgment having all the points in the world on the basketball or on some crazy video game won't mean nothing [Applause] it won't mean nothing a real believer she has watched isaiah 53 be fulfilled and i want to say to you all of us have had some real disappointments in life and some real discouragements but no doubt she watched them beat him until he was totally unreasonable and there was simply nothing she could do to stop it i wasn't standing there beside of her to tell her mary there's a reason this has got to happen he is fulfilled in isaiah 53 so that i as a cancer victim can be and those men were anointed to beat him but she was standing there with her heart wide open watching her champion he was her champion and she was watching him being beat no doubt she stood in the crowd and she heard them people that she saw eat fish and eat bread and healed and miracles take place and she watched those families that only just a few days ago pulled down limbs and said hosanna to the king and it was a song of jubilation that took place the king is coming and here we are almost a week later and they're beating him like no other human being and now they're screaming crucify him no doubt she ran to him and said are you out of your mind are you insane and she was screaming his name but her scream amongst the thousands of people didn't mean nothing she watched him as he was now so war in his body until well now he couldn't carry his own cross they pushed him they beat him these hollywood movies couldn't touch how bad it really was they can't go to the realms of how vicious that calvary was and he did it for you that's what this week in history was because without him doing it you're lost i don't care what your last name is you're lost without being born again you're lost oh brother ron i want to make the rapture well you got to be born again you got to be baptized the name of the lord jesus christ you've got to go through the process [Applause] there's a lot of people want the gold gold necklace of i've overcome and i'm a champion of laodicea but they don't want to go through the process they want to be recognized in a church but they don't never want to come [Music] brother ron's my pastor i didn't know it i preached for a funeral yesterday for a person that i didn't know i was their pastor i'm not judged today but one day i will be sometimes we come into church and we want this to go real quick we want a microwave sermon we want to fix we want to fix without being born again mary magdalene's friends changed once jesus came into her life they were no more of the people that she once was part of your friends will tell you where you're at in your life if i take away you and have a testimony from your personal friends what kind of a person is that would they tell me what a christian i've never known anybody quiet on that order or will they tell me about your parties prettiest harlot no this woman met jesus this next scene i want to tell you about is more than i can stand but now jesus can't carry his own cross and say they pull a man out of the crowd not even his own race but it's a god race actually his two sons will be in the new testament rufus would be one of them and they'd be real real men and simon steps out and steps up under the cross picks it up now jesus is with him i don't know what it would be like but if i could take simon's place just for a few moments i just say one step in front of the other just keep pulling for you i'd be telling him every step i love you watching the blood run through his beard watching his eyes roll from one place to another as they beat him and they mock him and the woman runs out in front of it where was the thousands was the hundreds let's just come down where was the tents where's the disciples at where's the men are gonna carry the book of acts where are they at mary magdalene runs out in front of this this this mob and her hero is taking one step after another and it's more than she can stand what has he done she's trying her best she doesn't realize he's got to do this he's got to do this he's got to do this for her for me for this rapture to happen he's got to do this now for just a moment let me just say this to you do you think he did all of that just to let us just mosey through life and listen this rapture is imminent this is a bride of jesus christ as the showcase of the world as the queen of heaven as the vision of the bride of jesus christ to the prophet of god brother branham and choosing of a bride go listen to it recognizing your day and its message brother branham gives that vision and he said here come the world the bride of the world and they come shimming in he said i was ashamed of her had little fig leaves all over had their national garbs on he said i hail my head in shame but if you remember he'd already saw the vision of the bride and she was beautiful she was pure she was holy that's what god thinks of this bride she's without spot or blemish you can't see yourself that way but god sees you that way queen of heaven i'm glad i can have i'm glad i can have church with you it went out for a moment queen of heaven i'm glad i can have church with you we're gonna make it we're gonna make it i'm gonna just give you one more scene and then i'm gonna just stay with today is the third day and so she was instructed to go to the tomb carry the spices there you're going check on if anybody knew the power of his transformation she knew it she knew what it was to have two lives one is a harlot one is a real lady of grace for us we've had a we've had a real touch in our life to know what we was but we are and god don't see us as what we was no more now for those that are still working and let me just let me just touch this you can't get past what you've done and your mistakes that you've made in your life remember this that if god that made all things and knows how many fleas and flies and ticks and every every count of a man of a hair's head has been on the face of the earth if he can't find your sin in the blood of jesus christ why should you go back and look let me go one step further we don't have a right to judge another now god don't he loves a sinner but he hates the sin he's not going to leave you where you was he's not going to save you for you to continue to be what you was but he's going to save you with purpose with purpose sister tara with purpose god saves you with purpose he redeems you with purpose and you look around and you go well why didn't my friends see this predestination how can we explain it you're one out of a million all the book of redemption all the names on the book revelations 5 all the names on the book and god before the foundation of the world chose who would be the first one to know that he was alive not a phd not a ddd not a great a woman that had been delivered of seven demons a woman that silently preached for about three years of the character of the power of redemption of christ she's the woman that will make her way to the tomb and she'll look in and see two angels she stands up and it's more than her heart can say i mean how do you explain this are you seeking the living amongst the dead it's more in a sermon and she stands up she turns and there's a man and she assumes he's the gardener she assumes he's the man that's moved jesus's body you just can't put it all together calls her by name probably 200. 200 plus here i called you by name tonight today you perk up talking about me this gardener says mary she recognizes in the moment she'd watched him beat him she'd watched him hang him she'd tried to stop the riot she'd help them carry him to the tomb and here's he's standing and he said touch me not touch me not i have not ascended to the father yet you know what she does she goes tells the world he picked a woman he picked a woman that could stand up to those disciples i said come to the tomb it's empty come to them that was scared and bewildered hey listen the treasure's just hung himself the world has turned against him their champion has just been buried in a tomb and now here she comes with the testimony he's alive [Applause] [Music] if i could take his her place today i'd like to
