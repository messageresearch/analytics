Holy Ghost your Holy Spirit just move Among Us freely we pray Jesus name [Music] amen amen you turning Bibles to Isaiah 40. verse 25 and also Ephesians 3. amen like as I said it's very good to be with you tonight and got quite a bit of folks even from our home church that's here with us tonight and I want to thank them for coming amen means a lot and it drives 16 hours to hear you preach when they could have waited to Wednesday night we'll be back big man but uh that ain't just why they came they came to be in the presence of God amongst God's people and put her shoulder to the wheel and amen and amen Just To See God do Mighty things among us I'm believing for that I'm believing for miracles to take place because he's a miracle-working god amen Isaiah 40 and verse 25 says to whom then will you liken me or shall I be equal saith the Holy One lift up your eyes on high and behold who hath created these things that bringeth out their hosts by number he calleth them all by names by the greatness of his might for that he is strong in power and not one faileth not one faileth Ephesians 3 verse 20. it says now unto him that is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in US unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages World Without End Amen God bless you and be seated thank you I've been on this subject of light for some time at home and can't seem to get away from it amen I enjoy light amen I enjoy being in the places amen there's no Darkness I don't like Darkness I'm not a child of the dark amen I'm a Child of the Light how many children of the light tonight but I'd like to speak to you on the unlimited light the unlimited light Job chapter 11 would say it like this he said can you solve the mysteries of God can you discover everything about the almighty such knowledge is higher than the heavens and who are you it is deeper than the underworld what do you know it is broader than the earth and wider than the sea in other words there's really no ability of a limited being Amen to describe an unlimited being see God has no Rivals not only that he is the one a man who measures and decrees the boundaries by which his creation abides there is none like our God the god of the Bible is incomparable infinitely above his creation to say that anyone or anything is like him is to try to express the unlimited and limited terms any comparison will fall short just as the authors of the scripture search for an adequate human language to apply to Heavenly Visions we find ourselves also ill-equipped to express God's Perfections even as the children of Israel would stand on that Seashore and they saw all those wonderful things that had just taken place and and they've seen their enemy that was dead behind them and they saw a God who was able to deliver them and and to set them free and they would begin to say who is Like You O Lord among the gods who is like you Majestic in Holiness awesome and glorious Deeds doing wonders even David would say who is like the Lord Our God who is Seated on high who looks far down on the heavens and the Earth the answer is no one is like him there's no one there's no one like Jesus amen creation exists and within the limits of time and the limits of space cannot rival much less much less fully articulate the splendors of a limitless God unlimited means not limited or restricted in terms of number quality or extent it's not limited it's having an infinite number of solutions I'm glad he's got an infinite number of solutions amen I'm glad I don't get the number whatever billion zillion and he's run out of solution but he hasn't run out tonight amen unlimited is also an inexhaustible it's Limitless it's boundless it's unbounded it's immense it's vast great extensive and measurable incalculable unfailing Untold Everlasting infinite endless never-ending bottomless measureless unrestricted unconstrained uncontrolled unrestrained unchecked unhindered unhampered unimpeded unfettered untrammeled amen unbridled uncurved absolute full utter ultimate Supreme Sovereign and omnipotent hallelujah what a mighty God we serve tonight amen amen exhaustible it's unable to be used up amen unrestricted unconstrained untrammeled I I looked at that word untraveled not deprived of Freedom or action amen incalculable it's too great to be calculated amen that's the god that we serve he's not you know it's funny how men can put him in a little box but you can't put this God in your box he's too big for your box amen he's a God who goes beyond human reasonings and human understandings and he does things that we don't know and we can't even think we don't even know how it's going to work out but somehow he does it we don't know how he's going to do it but somehow he did it we don't know how he's going to heal but somehow he did it amen we don't know how he's going to set free but somehow he does it he's that kind of God he's an unlimited God and I just want to look into this tonight he said brother Brandon would say it like this he said I've noticed among our Brethren many of you as coming to Full Gospel people coming from the Baptist Church myself and accepting the doctrine of the baptism the Holy Spirit he said I want how Martin Luther had a had a part in justification he preached it he believed it he said it was the light of his day and but then he he entered he entered into another Veil a man John Wesley he said when Calvinism was beginning to sweep the nation and they settled down saying what God's going to do he'll do and no it does us no good to have a Revival but God raised up John Wesley and he certainly smashed Calvinism to the ground to the place where it ought to have a right balance in the works of sanctification and the work of Grace nazarenes carried it Pentecostals character and the baptism the Holy Spirit moving on and off to higher Heights he said but when the Brethren received the baptism the Holy Ghost he said this is the summit this is the all of it but Brethren that's wrong there's no Summit to God's power there's no Summit to God's power we move on and on and on it's unlimited resources of God that hasn't even been tapped into yet blessings and powers that we know nothing about hallelujah it's never been even revealed to the archangels but it's laying just ahead for his church that will believe how many Believers here tonight for I has not seen Ear Has Not Heard neither is enter into the hearts of men what God has in store for them that love him he said so let's just continue to move on up and claim our rights he said God opened the gates and he swings out the welcome mat let's move into deeper depths and never colonize ourselves or organize ourselves and get into a place where we believe this and that's all let's believe this plus how much more we can hear from God he said I think that ought to be the motive of every man woman Amen to love that loves the Lord Jesus is to receive all that you can from the hand of his Bountiful mercies that's my heart [Applause] I hope you didn't come thinking your Cup's full tonight amen God wants to give you more exceedingly abundant even more than you can ever think or ask I hope you don't think you've got all of God tonight you say well I've been around the message for 40 years you ought to be progressing every day of your life you ought to be moving up there is no Summit to the power of almighty God therefore there's no Summit Amen to the Holy Ghost there's no Summit to his ability to heal and deliver and set free God has a constantly unveiling and revealing himself to his children Hallelujah see if you can limit God you can limit Christ and if you live it to church today and its possibilities you're limiting God but all things whatsoever you desire When you pray believe you receive them and ye shall have them he said it I believe it and I know it to be the truth hallelujah amen driving down these highways out here we see speed limit signs along the way and they're placed there maybe for your protection and safety and things uh you know the number on the sign that forms us the maximum speed and I know I'm not going to ask for hands how many tonight obeyed those signs uh but you know it it's supposed to be there to indicate amen you can't go any higher or you can't reach any higher than that he said but see he said most definitions of the word limit expresses a point or a level Beyond which something is not to extend or pass and you know our senses can place limits on God our faith can place limits on God man Through the Ages have placed limit signs on the highway can only go so fast we've had 2 000 years of manned speed limits we realize we've had something where we now realize we have something that's been released in this hour that has no limits the limiter has been taken off the restrictor has been taken off amen I want you to understand this service tonight has no limits amen you're going to get out of it what you come expecting to receive if you become respect and receive something from God you're going to receive something of God Amen he has come Amen to pour out more than you can carry out of here Hallelujah so I would be coming with my picture and saying God I need more of you I want more than I had yesterday I want more of you I want to love you more I want to serve you more I want to give more of my heart to you [Applause] signs 150 years ago made a statement that if a man went with the terrific speed of 30 miles an hour gravitation would take him off the Earth he reckon science would say stand by that today no no because he was riding on aux card do you think science looks back that today and says that's the truth no they're going hundreds and even hundreds more miles an hour than that in a jet plane still going and moving further brother said it like this he said we're up to the place where we can believe in the baptism of the Holy Ghost we can believe in the healing of the sick he said but let's move on to the resurrection of the dead and the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ amen we're not just happy here we're moving forward amen we're moving on down the road amen I Hey listen I'm looking for that day amen when the dead in Christ's gonna rise we got people over there we want to see and we're looking for most of all we want to see our Lord Jesus Christ amen the church though cannot Camp down on the things that we're seeing around us and say this is all there's no Summit to the power of almighty God as signs can only go so far that it falls back but we have untapped Resources by Divine promise from none other than the Son of God saying whatsoever you ask in my father's name I will do it Hallelujah amen Isaiah 50 you say well I don't know I think this and I think that well I'm glad we're not going on your thoughts amen amen but Isaiah 55 verse 8 says my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways saith the Lord for as high as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts are higher than your thoughts amen I'm sure thankful that I'm not dependent on what some man thinks about me if I'm going to make it if I'm not going to make it I'm sure thankful that I'm not dependent on a God who one day thinks one thing about me and the next day he thinks somebody something else and it changes his mind but God thought about you before the foundation of the world and they ain't a devil in hell that can change his mind about you Hallelujah in the where were you at Job amen before the foundation of the world when the morning Stars sang and the sons of God shouted for joy that's where I was and the thoughts of almighty God and he still has you in his mind [Applause] Hallelujah amen I'm told he said I'm told by aviators who fly these fast jet planes that if all of a sudden it'll get to a certain speed and it'll go to vibrating and shake it seems like the boats are going to fly off and the wings are going to come off until they pass the sound barrier amen the devil wants to put a barrier there some of you he's placed a barrier by bitterness and you can only go so far and you can only go so fast or he puts a barrier of unforgiveness there in front of you and you won't forgive and you won't let go and it stops you and it slows you down on the path of life but God wants you to break through those barriers matter of fact he set up a whole service tonight that you can tread your wings and you can bust through that barrier and you can go into all things are possible and you can rise above all the things in your life foreign get past those barriers well if we can get past that barrier and our thoughts and how we think it ought to be well I ain't like that song and I don't get past all of that [Applause] he said if the Church of this day will ever pray till they pass the sin barrier and the unbelief barrier they could shout the victory of a living God oh I see if you ain't got no shout you ain't got past the berry barrier yet amen but the devil's trying to put a barrier there trying to put a restriction there you can only praise him so much you can only do so much you can only go so far and that's going to be fanaticism you're only going to do this and it's just a motion what's he doing he's trying to put limits and limitations on our worship on our praise to a living God [Applause] amen just not for too many miles from here is going to be a football game going on and then people are going to become Maniacs they're going to paint themselves up they're going to address the part they're going to look the part they're going to jump and act a fool over somebody passing a pig skin [Music] well I mean if they can do that about some perverts running up and down the field how much more to the children of God ought to be the praise the Living God with living signs and living wonders living amongst the people yeah we got a reason to praise him we got a reason to shout I know what he done for me I know hey changed my life I know hey set me free and they want to call you crazy you're praising an unlimited God [Applause] they're praising a man that's going to go commit adultery in a few days it's hangs you're praising The God Who took your sin and he took your unbelief and he nailed it to a cross he took your sickness amen when you pass that barrier and you begin looking to the Unseen Hallelujah and letting the world vibrate and do what it wants to do goodbye world I stay no longer with you amen there's a living God when we lose our disbelief and unbelief in him and pass that place that the world is saying the days of Miracles are passed it ain't even just the world anymore it's something the messages saying that but it makes you shake oh there's no such a thing as the baptism the Holy Ghost yeah some of the message is saying that it makes you wonder but if you'll just look at the Unseen to The God Who promised it for the promises unto you and your children to them that are far off even many as the Lord Our God shall call if you'll look to the Blessed word that says Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and turn your heads towards that and press on until you pass that vibration pass the unbelief barriers pass the sin barriers and all the things that hinder you then you'll fly free in the faith of God knowing that all things are possible then there's no limit did you hear that there's no limit to the speed that plane will go if there's no limit to the speed the plane will go there's no limits to the blessings that God will pour down upon a Believer who will believe [Applause] I was listening I was listening to a tape here the other day brother Brown said if a city had a 30 mile per an hour speed limit and when you would get a ticket if you went over that some of them you know they may give you a 10 mile an hour grace period and and then they tell you well that's that's fanaticism oh sorry some of them one mile an hour and that's all you can go call them speed traps amen but if the mayor he said come and gave you said you refuse needing to get to a sick person or somebody that was in trouble you can go as fast as you need to go and this is words of the Prophet excuse he said if there's some two-bit cop stopped you for going 10 miles over the speed limit foreign he couldn't give you a ticket because you had been given permission to go beyond what the speed limit says he said I hope you're getting it you have been invited to go beyond what man has determined image have been taken off you can go into the unlimited power of the almighty God oh there were one-time limits placed on the church they were limited by a false baptism they were limited by believing in three gods they were limited by other things that were held against it but in this day the limiters have been ripped off and the limits can no longer be enforced did you hear that devil the limits can no longer be enforced therefore he can't limit my praise he can't limit my breakthrough he can't limit amen the things of God and the blessings he's going to pour out in my life he has no limitations he has no right amen they want to come put limits on your worship and say you can only go 40 miles an hour rip that thing down [Applause] and I want us to put limits on your overcoming life so you can only go so far Rift that thing down we're living in a time that there's no limitation on the Church of the Living God she can go down the Divine Healing amen she can go to the body change what do you think he's trying to put limits on you because he knows there's a change coming [Applause] he said when you when the people realize that you are not you or you will be but you are present tense Sons and Daughters of God he said you're pushing out to the Millennium all the blessings out to the Millennium but it's right now we don't need Divine Healing in the Millennium it's now when we have it we won't be sons of gods we are now sons of God heirs and Joint heirs with Jesus and everything that Jesus died for is my possession he says brother Satan don't like that but if the people would only realize and just be willing to take God in his word well it's Unlimited in other words we don't have to pay attention to Satan's speed limits they don't obtain to us [Applause] don't listen to the church the other day but back in about 1994 I was in uh first one of my first trips overseas if not my first and I was in Germany and we got the chance to go on the Autobahn and that was a wonderful thing but I was in a little car glorified a go-kart golf cart we're just in the right lane because you got in the left lane you was going to get ran over what we had Porsches and this and that of Yaris I mean just right down the road [Music] on an unlimited Highway amen the ability or the or the the freedom to be able to go as fast as I want to go amen here I mean listen we don't have to be in a little with the prophet of God let it craft a car running down the highway Hallelujah it'll drive down to Divine Healing it'll hit him down to all things are possible in a run over every devil that gets in front of him foreign my wife one day was on our way to church one one Wednesday night I believe I was getting ready to preach and I'm just driving the sun's kind of my eyes and the last moment I saw this snake right on the edge of the highway I didn't have time to dock to dodge nothing I was poop you heard him pop I looked and I seen him just waggling up over there that gasping his last breath or whatever they do and I said well I I didn't see that snake coming my wife looked at me said I don't think he saw you coming I prayed that when this meeting is up hello Devil he's withering around he didn't see you coming he'd been used to a little Ox car coming down the road where he can move out of the way but all of a sudden River Room right over his rotten stinking High [Music] amen I'm looking for the atmosphere that all things are possible amen why why not why not take the limiters off and say every person in this building can go home well prophet of God did it amen that's what he believed I think we can believe the same thing he believed let's get in this car and drive let's run over that old cancer devil let's run over that depression devil and that Spirit of anxiety let's run right over him and make him twist up and blow that old Blue Smoke come on somebody we ain't paying attention to Satan's speed limits well the prophet of God didn't pay attention to it either he didn't care if he's in church or out in the woods anyway he didn't care what the devil had to say David all like no singing around here I don't care what the devil don't like yeah we don't like no shout around I don't care what the devil don't like he came to the wrong church service the wrong weekend of meetings [Music] we don't care we've been given permission we've been given permission to believe that all things are possible we've been given permission to believe that cancer not even cancer was stand before us we didn't get permission to believe therefore I believe [Applause] he said he was out there in the wilderness and storm blew up it had ceased for a while and he walked out from behind the tree he was taking some cover and he said I heard an old bull elk began to bug one and said they'd kind of got he's trying to call the rest of the herd back together it got scattered during the storm and Maya says I heard that and I began to hear David when the Deep calleth to the Deep there's a deep calling there's got to be a deep to respond to it somewhere he said then that nature began to rise up in me he said here's a place for me to hold what music way back over there an old gray wolf out mate answered him down the bottom said oh my that's when the Deep really calls to the Deep hear that wild called The Wolf Somewhere Out animal Scream the birds screaming to me it's God I can hear him out there as he is in his creation the wind's blowing I happen to look back over and blowing cold enough to freeze the water in the Evergreens but the sun came up over the West this way and looked like a little aisle looking down like God looking at his Creation in the sunset and I noticed it caused the rainbow across the canyon I said there he is in the rainbow there he is in the elk there he is and the Wolf calling here he is in the trees I can hear his voice Whispering there he is Yonder over on the right he said he just looked looked upon as a Jasper and started stone with a rainbow over his head Alpha and Omega the beginning the end he that was witchism shall come the root and offspring of David oh that rainbow seven colors Perfection God is perfected there and that Covenant amen everywhere you look you can see God he said but while I got all filled up after a while I got all filled up he said I'm going to tell you something you don't know I'm a real Baptist but after a while I was looking at that I got so full of the Holy Ghost until I set my gun against a tree and I run around the tree just as hard as I could kicking up one foot in the air screaming to the top of my voice Hollow hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and around and around and around until it almost fell down yeah he wasn't worried about too much order there had to stop him jerk my hands up in the air again and hollered glow all right Glory Glory Glory Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah I'm just reading it I love you Hallelujah just as hard as I could run I couldn't think of nothing else to say my heart was bubbling over what was it it was a deep caller to the deep I heard God out yondering away that maybe you wouldn't hear him but to me he's in his Universe calling back I'm the god of creation I've made all things by my hand he said if somebody came in those woods they'd have thought they had a maniac round and around and around having me a glorious time that's 50 miles 30 miles anywhere from anybody as far as I knew around around the tree I went screaming because what it was God's Cathedral I could see him everywhere the Sun the streets coming through the woods the rainbow the Wolf Hall and the elk I could hear them in the winds Oh my he was everywhere way higher you could see the snow peaked on the Mountain Shadows off down to the Evergreens I looked everywhere you could see him he is in his Universe do you believe that but I stood there for a little bit and after a while I heard something going chatter chatter chatter chatter chatter chatter chatter though what is that I looked around there was this old blow down there storm would blowed down some trees a storm previous and there was this little Pine squirrel I don't know whether you know what they are or not how many knows what a pine squirrel is he jumped up an old tree stumped there and just acting like he was about to have a fit going to try to tear him into pieces chatter chatter chatter jumping up and down shaking all over as hard as he could oh he was going to cut me up and I thought well little fella there's no need of getting all that excited there you're not going to do nothing no did I scare you or something well you ought to get what what what you scared about I was only praising God that made both of us there's no need of you getting all tore up I would that's why we need to tell to a few critics I'm only praising God that made both of us what are you getting scared about it's funny people not even in the presence of God and scared of it amen but here this little squirrel was giving himself a Time he says there's no need of you getting all tore up I was praising him so don't get all excited about that I was just praising God you ought to have no better than to holler at me like that don't interrupt to me when I'm shouting like that because I'm having a good time leave me alone now I hope you're catching it leave me alone so I happen to notice this little fellow would his head sideways and look down that brush when it come to find out he wasn't really barking to me out of that brush through the storm this big old Eagle had been forced down and he was smashed down like that blow down the blow down but that big fella with that little Pine squirrel was all that's what he's all excited about and he jumped up on a little hem I thought now wait a minute here there's something somewhere because I was worshiping God running around this tree I see him all these different elements but why has he interrupted me for such as this said there's an old he'll admire him can I see God in him and I begin to look at those great big looking eyes he looked there on that limb looking to me did you look at the squirrel and he looked back at me he'd look at that squirrel he'd look back at me he said I guess you're looking this over ain't you oh boy you know I could shoot you if I wanted to I looked up at him my rifle setting against the tree did you know I could shoot you if I wanted to he never paid no attention to that he just kept sitting there I thought what does God want me to see don't be afraid the Eagle's Brave he's not afraid he wouldn't be ashamed to tell his boss he got healed by Divine Healing it don't bother him he's strong he won't be afraid to testify if he received the Holy Ghost he's Brave I thought well what's what you saw what makes you so brave but I noticed he kept just kind of moving them two wings you know they move their feathers back and forth pulled their wings I thought oh I see uh-huh God gave you two wings and you know good and well you could take them two big wings and be out of the Timber before I could ever reach that rifle he had confidence in what God had given him he said how much different is it with the human being God gave us the Holy Ghost and still we don't know what it'll do for us it's unlimited what he will do whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe you kitten and you shall have it that eagle could trust it is god-given wings he knew what he was talking about and we got the Holy Ghost and haven't tried it out he said that's where it's at if we just let nature work within us like the animal does try out what God has given you knew the distance where I was from my rifle he could be in the timber and I never see him again so he kept moving those big wings I said oh boy I never shoot you I'm so proud of you I like to see something that's got some spunk in it all right we don't need no wimpy dish rags well you ain't gonna believe Pastor what I would ask up my big time I bet you don't come say that here [Music] we don't win no need no wimpy dish rags we need some people with some spunk in them time you come to the house of God with some spunk in you amen that you believe in what God has given you he's giving you a book full of promises you ought to believe in what God has given you you ought to depend on him and it ain't just depending on what a preacher says or his idea but God gave you this he says also spunk is something that'll stand up when they know what they're doing don't you like to see that he said that's the reason I like the Pentecostal Church don't care what the world says call them Holy Rollers do what do whatever you want to they'll stand up and shout just the same praise the Lord go on right on I like that I don't know where you critics stand but I like that certainly stand right up to it don't make any difference who it is stay there and give your testimony give God praise anyhow said but I watch this old Eagle as he moved around but you know after a little bit I happened to notice he wasn't watching me much he was getting tired of that squirrel that was cursing him saying chatter chatter chatter chatter chatter he just looked over him after a while he got so annoyed at him he gave a big jump and he flapped Them Wings about twice and he was out of the Timber and out of sight Hallelujah I'm about tired of those Old Pine squirrels that says days of Miracles are path and there's no such a thing as a power of God in the church anymore there's no such a thing as an atmosphere of the Holy Ghost you chatter chatter chatter chatter just a little while this bride is going to jump off thank you is he going to jump off of this Dimension and plop those wings and change bodies in the air and you'll be left chatter chatter chatter I thought there was going to be a Rapture chatter chatter chatter I thought there was going to be a body chain chatter chatter chatter [Applause] [Music] he just kept going up and up and up and up and up there's nothing but a little spot I stood there with tears running down my cheeks I said oh God what a great place to be there you are in that eagle he made one jump because he trusted his wings he didn't flop from one meeting to another from one Church to another he just made one big flop and set his wings in the power of God amen come on Eagles you ain't got to flop around to each meeting you ought to be soaring into the meeting amen soaring into the things of God it's unlimited they want to say days of Miracles are passed no such thing as the Holy Ghost that's for another day pass oh just set your wings in the power of God let the Holy Ghost rise you above that nonsense and go on and on and on he could never even hear that chipmunk no more whatever you want to call him ground squirrel got tired of that chatter chatter he said oh if the church one of these days are going to get tired of all of that they'll know how to set their wings and they'll just take a walk with God and go home out of all of it Hallelujah he said days of Miracles was passed tell me when just come you come too late to tell us that days of Miracles has passed no such a thing as the Holy Ghost speaking in tongues is just make believe that's all they know about it but you just need to set your wings just set your wings move out of it but too many times we're pushing it all out to the Millennium somewhere all the blessings out there you know we'll have that complete body change and that real Divine we we need Divine Healing now it ain't just out there it's now it's tonight [Applause] now is when we have it we won't be sons of God we are now sons of God it is our possession Satan don't like that but it's unlimited but as I said a French scientist 300 years ago scientifically proved in their modern theories he proved that a man would ever reach a speed of 30 miles an hour gravitation would take him off the Earth but science will never go back to that we're going beyond that he said science is eating off the tree of knowledge but it can only go so far he said when the tree of knowledge ends he said it's time to step onto the Tree of Life because the tree of life is unlimited it has untapped resources amen don't be scared to step out on the tree of life and take God in his word God will back up his word [Applause] you know I think about those those right those people that take off of those astronauts take off of those Rockets they're sitting on the very top of this thing and they're having confidence in something man-made that has blown up before has killed people before has just obliterated they can't even find them and they're sitting here they got confidence I'm going to leave this world and I'm going to another place and they're looking they're sitting on top of this thing filled with jet fuel certain kind of fuel rocket fuel and they're sitting there and you know what I I began to think about I doubt that up there on their monitors is Fox News and CNN and Facebook no they're not interested in none of that nonsense because they're leaving this place they're going to another place to another round to to the to the atmosph the atmosphere or another and so they're sitting there and they're sitting and they're looking up hey man you know just uh here a couple of years ago we had our first rocket take off again and during that time there was riots taking place and there was this going on and covet and not all this stuff was happening and I you know I have to believe that those men was looking there looking where they're going they wasn't looking over here in Minneapolis or looking at this over here looking at that over there or this church trouble over here or that over there I don't like the way he done this and I don't like the way he built this and I don't no no they were looking up they were looking where they're going [Applause] and when you got your eyes on Church troubles or family issues or this that and the other amen you got your eyes on where you're going [Applause] if your eyes stay in a ditch you're going to end up in a ditch if your eyes stay end up staring on the side of the road that's where you're going to go amen but our eyes need to be tuned not to what's around us but what where we're going hallelujah amen we're sitting on an unlimited resource that's going to change our mortal body take us from this atmosphere to another dimension and I'm going to tell you you're not going to go there in Ox cart I haven't yet seen an ox cart leave the ground and go to the moon or stars or anywhere five feet off the ground unless it fell off a cliff you need a rocket so God brought it and he set it up and he put unlimited power in there amen unlimited resources in there that we can grab a hold of us full of Miracles and full of healings full of deliverances and full of the power of God amen what are we seeing in this day omnificent omnipotent is speaking the miraculous has happened Among Us amen we see it all around he said well if God be God where are the Miracles they're all around us I hope to God that none of this church is asking where the miracle is amen the miraculous is happening all around us he said so why don't you get in and go with us [Applause] listen if you're a Critic tonight you don't have to stay one if you're lost tonight you don't have to stay lost if you're bound tonight you don't have to stay Brown there is a power that will set you free Hallelujah so why don't you get in and go with us why don't you get in tall things are possible get into the miraculous power of almighty God and to the Saving Grace [Applause] call on your brother call on your sister but he said I'm not meaning that you're not in a sense but I want you to get into the blessing Hallelujah he says wouldn't that Pentecostal Church as soon as it was born or any other church when it's born in the kingdom of God it becomes Sons and Daughters of God but we stop at that he said when the Pentecostal Church received the gift of speaking in tongues and interpretation they stopped at that that's no place to stop that's a place to begin well we've got untapped resources everywhere all things are possible to them that believe every promise in the Bible belongs to us so the trouble of is you can tell uh that you know our fellow citizens on the kingdom of God the Methodist Baptist different ones you can tell them about Divine Healing the power of God and they'll refer back to what they did what happened in Moody what'd he say about it what somebody else said about it looking back he said we could say the Pentecostal brother well if we'd go back and Yonder when our forefathers got it 50 years ago don't ever Look Backwards look forward keep looking forward signs don't do that science keeps going to find god well before the preacher does if you don't watch it in his researches he says science some 300 years ago would say that a man would move so fast he would leave the Earth but he could think modern science would listen to that again he's going 2 000 miles an hour and he's not even stopping at that he's going on and on that's science science is going on and on and on but they are going to come to an end they are limited in what they can do they have built themselves in such a place that we have nuclear power now that's going to burn this whole earth and it's going to burn everybody that's here and be consumed with unquenchable fire by the power of science of course we know the fire of God is going to come as well and cleanse the whole earth and all that but nuclear power is going to be released upon this Earth amen they have gone amen because you know one day they was fighting and it was pew and that was the biggest thing they had and then they got this boom or they had this and they got this and then next thing you know World War one they realized the power of the plane and what they do in these little biplanes they would get one guy in the seat with a bomb and they would fly over and he would just try to look down [Music] but that wasn't where it was had continued and it continued to progress until World War II that could sit in a machine and they could look and they could push a button and and get it pretty precise at least in the general area and then we saw in Desert Storm one of the first public uh public Wars that would take place and it was all over the news how they could drop a laser-guided missile down a tube a chimney in the house and over there one of those men that was fighting some of our men said you know he said I realize we is in trouble when a missile came down my street and took a left turn it had progressed it had moved forward and it's going to nuclear power to where it's going to burn the whole Earth well if science is progressing how much more should we be moving forward listen we shouldn't be dropping it no we have the long tap resources the power the move of the Holy Ghost amen that's greater than any nuclear power it could ever be released upon this earth oh I know about the power of God it'll fall in your life and it'll burn out sin it'll burn out unbelief it'll turn every devil away from you and it'll give you a power to rise above it Amen to live above it it's Unlimited to where Jesus way and say if you say to this mountain and be moved and don't down your heart but believe what you said it shall it shall it shall come to pass today we think of going to church shaking hands with the preacher putting their name on the book being immersed we got it made go to so-and-so's church we got it we receive the Holy Ghost fell on us we began to begin shouting praising God and the power of God came down spoke in tongues heard them interpreted great quotations so forth prophecies that's fine he said well we just stop that's just the beginning he said well brother Timothy would uh what what I get confused with searching and stability and what what I do brother Aaron put it like this I thought it was really good he said you need to be stable but yet still desperate don't ever be satisfied where you're at I want more a drunk don't become a drunk just taking a sip every now and then no he wants the whole bottle and the bottle ain't enough he wants more and he wants more until his whole body becomes Intoxicated by that liquor as it goes down and takes over his bed and I thought my if a drunk wants that and he wants that in his self and he wants that in his life and that's his desire he'll sell out anything to get it he'll give up his wife he'll give up his home he'll give up his job whatever it is to get under that drink one more time or or that that influence of a drug one more time and I thought my he comes he'll get under it and come out of it he'll get under and come out of it and he'll have a hangover and have a headache and cause all kind of side effects but I thought ma if a drunk wants that and then a drug addict won't say how much more to the children of God want more of God it ain't a hangover you got to deal with it's God moving you to higher Heights and deeper depths and more of God more of God more of God more of God more of God more of God tomorrow night more of God Sunday morning more of God Monday morning more of God every day more of God it's Unlimited if you put a real drunk in a bar room and tell them have all you want believe me they ain't gonna be a bottle left he gonna take all of it amen when you have been given the unlimited resources of almighty God don't take a sip don't just take this and be satisfied every day of your life say I want more I desire more of him Lord there's one feeling but there's many refillings I say let the Holy Ghost fall in this place at a real free feel every vessel of God he'll feel you if you want it [Applause] people just don't don't want it they get a few hours of church and they've had enough easy now come on brother Timothy you had us rejoice and don't get us to squirming well here we are same people that fuss is about a two-hour sermon we'll listen to a two-hour movie watch a ball game and don't think nothing about it foreign I want to turn to Second Kings 4. we kind of I don't even know where we're at in time but anyway it says one of the wives of the man of the sons of the prophets cried out to Elisha for help saying your servant my husband is dead and you know that your servant reverently feared the Lord but the Creditor is coming to take my two sons to be his slaves in pavement for a loan Elisha said what shall I do for you tell me what do you have of value in your house [Music] what do you have of value in your house this time we do we take a checkup I know this is what do you have a value in your house she said your maidservant has nothing in the house except a small jar of olive oil a small jar of olive oil then he said go borrow containers from all your neighbors empty containers and not just a few go get all that you can gather get them all into your house you're going to see the glory of the Lord don't just get a couple don't just have just a few moments don't just have a few times go get all you can get Hallelujah and then you shall go in and shut the door behind you and your sons and pour out the oil you have into all these containers and you shall set aside each one when it's full so she left him and shut the door behind her in the Sun and they were bringing her the containers as she poured the alt now she said she had just a small jar foreign I know what that feels like really Donnie on a Wednesday sometimes you don't feel like you got much I don't feel like I got much but all of a sudden Lord is just take it and pour it out and somehow it just keeps coming out and it just keeps coming out and it just keeps coming out and it just don't seem like much I feel like man I don't have much tonight I don't know and it just keeps coming out Hallelujah and they were beginning they would be bringing the containers she poured the hole in the containers were all listen all full she said to her son bring me another container and he said to her there is not one left then the all stopped multiplying then she came and told the man of God and he said go sell the oil and pay your debt and yours you and your sons can now live on the rest so it's not just enough it was more than enough and she he filled up every container that she could pray every place in her life that she would open up he would if he would empty himself don't you understand tonight God will take ten percent he will take 50. he will take all he'll take none and whatever you want to give him tonight I would say God I want to open myself up amen the holy that has all been the type of the Holy Ghost she had some but she won't eat it more Hallelujah she asked what does she have now she had just a little she'd been to a meeting and got a little bit but she didn't recognize the power that was in that hole the the purchasing price of that oil a lot like the church they don't recognize the power of the Holy Ghost and the Liberty that is brought but don't ever limit God to Just a Touch thank you he wants to do exceedingly abundant more than what you can think or ask so take the limits off your thinking [Music] [Applause] amen the woman was told go get vessels from your neighbor wherever you and don't ask for a few lies to the word of the day said come all I need is empty vessels all I need is vessels that wants to open themselves up the Creditor was coming he was on his way to take her two sons to take her inheritance to take what was rightfully hers the Creditor was coming to take it but God was more than enough he was coming to take her Joy to take her happiness to take her peace to take things from her that God had paid for her the pouring of out of the empty vessels happened in her house all right so let's bring it down not to just this house to this house what are you going to bring to him this weekend he's Unlimited in what he can give you but he poured out into the vessels of Supply to get the Creditor off her back he's unlimited but his response equaled her vessels his response equaled what she came with what she was abroad what she listen you said well I want the preacher to preach me happy I want the song leader to sing some song Get me on my feet and get now what did you bring yeah it ain't all on the song leader it ain't all on a preacher it ain't all on the neighbor next to you what did you bring how many vessels did you bring what you brought will be filled and if he didn't bring enough I'd go out tonight and I'll give you some more say God I'm sorry for limiting you I'm taking the limiters off I'm taking it all off tonight and I'm opening up every room I'm opening up every closet feeling Lord feeling Lord oh yeah feeling Lord take it the creditors

you bring to these meetings how many jars of clay can you open up to the master say Lord feel it he hadn't run out of oil yet he'd been poured out all since for 2000 years he poured it out only on the ones up in the upper room he poured it out all the way down into our generation he hasn't got to this moment and got no every vessel that's going to be filled shall be filled oh Hallelujah thank you too many times our services we let it just all rest on the song leader I don't know why I'm hitting on that but we all let's Let It rest on that and if he dares sings a song we don't like we take our jar back you're limiting God that's what he said about Israel he said they limited the Holy One of Israel he wanted to do more for them he was a rock and a weary land he supplied a meat he supplied them and their shoes didn't even wear out but he wanted to do more but they would come to the first trial and say God why did you bring us here to die and laodicea why did you bring it in we're so dark around us there's no hope for it why and meanwhile he's over somewhere pouring out all it depends on this weekend if you go home full is if you open up your vessel for it to be filled because he's not out of oil open up your vessel to be healed open up your vessel to be delivered open up your vessel for the Son of God to come down and touch your life as never before I wonder how many times
