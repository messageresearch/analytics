to take quite a bit of time there's also a tube that they put me in that sometimes takes quite a long time and and they'll put headphones on me and so when they put headphones on me they'll ask me I said what do you want to listen to I said and I'll tell them Symphony piano really really they'll come back and they'll open the things up and she said did I hear you say that right Symphony piano yes

that be okay okay amen John chap 1 and verse 1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God it's quite a statement is it the same was in the beginning with god notice these next words all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made it's quite a statement isn't it I want you to read that last verse with me all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made so that means you're pretty important amen amen maybe you have a need you'd like to say would you come by Lord and touch me today Heavenly Father we love you today with all of our hearts we thank you for the strength to stand here and speak to the Bride of Jesus Christ and what a lovely group we ask you that you would just sweep across this audience anoint the gift in our lives and anoint the gift in their lives and Lord uh may we just come into fellowship with you and become very much aware that you're here now we have needs all of us do all of us have a different needs all of us are going through different things and I I ask you that you would help us today Lord we thank you for what Brother Ray and his team are doing here I I just cannot imagine in my mind's mind when you get all of the men like them together in that Millennium what will be accomplished I ask you that you would help us dear God today strengthen us in a special way we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen and amen God bless you you may be seated I want to just kind of ramble just for a moment if it would be okay amen this week something very special happened and I've given a lot of thought sister Chassidy had um had been adopted is this okay to tell I'm going to anyway sister chassid had been adopted into a wonderful family and I'm talking about wonderful family they were she was taken care of By Angels and so uh they were deeply loved we love them personally sister nise good to see you girl good to have you back and sister Chassidy got got word and was it a week or so she got a call and they begin to ask her this man begin to ask asked her what was her name kind of some background he said I think of your brother and we have a sister and so you got to meet them I saw the pictures and so when I saw the picture I I said that's definitely I'm sorry about the sister but I said that's definitely from the same bull amen that's what I said and as I begin to think about this now I want to bring every one of you into this I've been in China I've been all over Europe I've been throughout the Caribbean I've been in a lot of places I've been in New Zealand Australia a lot of places all over Canada and when I meet somebody for the first time I believe I can say this for you there's just a an attachment you don't know why you can't describe it but you feel like you found a part of yourself maybe for decades we haven't had this conversation so I'm just going to move him and so for decades you found yourself kind of missing a part of you and in just a matter of minutes a lot of questions are answered and that's by not by having a conversation but by that like spirit so when I get off of a plane and there's hundreds of people that are there I got off a plane in in Nashville one time and and there was a girl that got on and she was had a bodyguard that was with her and she got on the plane and she sat down beside of me she never said hello she curled up put the belt on and she curled up and went to sleep a immediately and when got off there was flowers on the floor and roses everywhere and there was a big placard it wasn't for me it was for the girl that sat beside of me and I didn't know I was sitting beside of a celebrity and uh and she was getting ready to get a Grammy award that night and and there was limousines waiting outside and all of that different kind of thing and I come to find out you know I rode with Taylor Swift I had no idea I didn't know who she was and she was a teenage phenomenon and I I didn't I never heard her music matter of fact I've still haven't heard her music and you know what meeting her didn't mean too much to me but I walked around the corner and there was a brother that said brother Ron and in a moment I felt that family feeling in a moment we were driving down out of service uh maybe a few months ago and and you guys had stopped on the side of the hill and I said Connie go back go back there they're real Believers go back they're part of our family I want to shake their hands I I want to tell them thank you for coming brother and sister seab breze let me just say this to you we came from God we came from God and we're going to go back to God and we're family here and we're family all over the world now many of them are different than what we are are some of noisy some are quiet and some are this way or some are that way but we all came from God we all came from God and we get around one another and after a little while we begin to discover that godlikeness about us all now it's that Humanity that we sometimes have difficulty with and but we realize that we are God has placed something to reflect like a star in our lives and we're reflections of him when we first begin to serve the Lord we'll we'll we'll discover more about ourselves and you know in the world we we couldn't get satisfied sin just couldn't satisfy us but it's just like when you serve God God just so fills you up and and he fills you up and he fills you up and and you want to be back in service and you want to be with one another an enemy will try to drive uh uh uh a vice between one another because he knows together we're stronger together we're stronger so whether it's a family or whether it's a church or where it's a multimember across the world it is Satan that tries to draw something between you because because he knows together together sure there'll always be differences but together when you can get those that difference out of the way I'm drawing from a background when I was about 18 years old and I was a senior probably 17 at that time and I was in a I was I was selected to be a special special part of the school or the county that where we was in and it was two from every school and I was selected to be one of them and they took us to Washington they did that on a few different kind of times and then some of them call it Governor school or whatever but they they took us to Washington and and on both occasions they they took us to an orchestra and was the national orchestra that was played and I didn't know much about it but one time that we went there and they were playing Peter and the Wolf you ever hear brother brandom talk about Peter and the Wolf and and they were playing this Orchestra I'm a country boy I've been raised on a farm I'm in a class of 33 people and uh you know and so anyway they take us there and then they move us to another place it's a theater and in that theater I'll never forget it it was a these things kind of stick in my mind it was a it was a theatrical event and it was an event called much ad do about nothing and I thought what in the world why am I sitting here and then the next theater was about the great Renaissance and so that was that was that was quite an interesting thing but but I thought what will I need in my life to know about much to do about nothing actually there was a TV series that came out many years later called Seinfield and it was much to do about nothing much to do about nothing and I think sometimes as Christians the enemy gets our eyes focused on that's right much a do about nothing I've often asked myself the question and so here we go I've often asked myself the question what was I doing watching a symphony on couple different occasions I'm 62 years old now one of my pastimes and one of the things that I do to go to sleep is I listen to Symphony and you go brother Ron but you're a country guy yeah but there's something on the inside of me that just kind of likes that that and then when I begin to study the message and and I begin to realize brother brandham is preaching in Yuma Arizona or he's preaching or in California or he's preaching over here in in Canada and and he's preaching all over the world whether it's in Finland or whether it's in Switzerland or in definitely in Jeffersonville or wherever he's preaching all of those sermons are linked together amen and it's kind of like the Bible 40 different writers none of them would hardly know one another but they were all inspired by the same writer and it would each one complement one another and brother brandom would say in Christ The Mystery of God and also other sermons he say if you can't read Jesus Christ in every scripture read it again and so when I begin to look at the services that we are involved in and many times our services here are like a convention service and every one of them is linked one to another and every one of them if you'll pay close attention has got a part for you inside of that service it's not a man that's doing any of that it's God that is doing that maybe I'll get to it again and I was just relooking at some of these things but I was looking at a a sermon that I preached before cancer and it says the hurt cannot hurt the music amen the hurt that you're going through will not stop the music that you have so I can look at it standing on this side four years later and say all of the hurt that we have went through with can answer has not deterred the music of Our Lives now if you remember there's a few things that I want to drop to you brother randam in the vision of the the bride coming into preview and then the last one he was watching I'm going to I'm just going to stay on the bride not the church world but in the as they begin to March as ladies and they're going forward and he was so pleased to see how that they were marching one in the back kind of kind of got out of step and he began to scream get back in line get back in line get back and step they were marching and he would sing the song many times in his ministries Onward Christian Soldiers let me just say this to you all of us whether it's in brother bram's meetings the mighty angel came down to this bride of Jesus Christ that a that Angel's still here Among Us we're under the influence of that Mighty angel now let me just say every one of us have to surrender our ambition to God brother BR we use a sermon called Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ he would surrender himself now as a Christian we know longer want our own will cuz our will and our choices took us away from God and we realize that our our choices took us out in the world and did a lot of different things but by predestination and the election and the adoption of God God comes in and I I I don't know if you're at this stage yet or not but maybe when you were younger it felt like don't do don't do don't do you must not do you must do this you must do that and it was almost somebody like a somebody beating you with a hammer come on but if you ever fall in love with [Applause] God you don't want to do anything that's wrong you just want to be right you just want to love him you just want to please him you want to you just want to be a part of his program whether he's at that's where I want to be Jesus would even pray this and I I'll share this with you and after this manner therefore pray you our Father which art in Heaven Matthew chapter 6 and verse 9 Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name let's read it together thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us of our debts as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever brother Steven he prayed not my will but thy will be done he could have had a family he could have had a church he could have had the kingdom himself he was offered to United States he could have had all of those things because the king of this world was offering it to him but you was on his mind brother Vernon down through time six Church ages you was on his mind seven Church ages you was on his mind 6,000 years he's looking down through looking at time seeing you if he takes his own will he loses you now notice just for a basis brother Braham said his word is like a great Symphony and how many of ever heard of a symphony you know when I begin to study the message I brother brandham a symphony and he says well everybody has now remember a symphony is when music is played in a drama I think I have it right a symphony Peter and the Wolf and you remember that the old Story how they used to I've heard that how that they would take the drums and make the little woodpecker pecking and Peter going out and the growling of the wolf and the toting of the horns a symphony notice how he begins to just bring us all into it he says now if you don't understand a symphony it's a big bunch of Racket to you said brother Ron i' just rather hear some Blu grass well isn't it great that God made us all different am Hallelujah now you got to understand what it is it's all done by signs and motion but it acts like a drama in this Symphony and we notice the only one that understands a symphony is a composer and those who are interested in knowing it knows its changes knows what it taking place now the composer knows every move move from the end to the beginning he's the one who writes it and he says he said he he said the one who wrote it up he composes it and he knows every little Junction and it's important that you get the Junctions right and if he knows every Junction so does the director the director has to know every move he said to direct it he says now how are you going to twist a Creed or or one little miscue of a stick and a sign and one little missign at a junction would throw the whole Orchestra off he said throw the whole Symphony out he said now you know that's true the composer and the director has to be in the same spirit are you with me now let's just lay out some let's just lay out some Basics here now the director that is going to direct maybe the national Orchestra he has to pick a piece that he's inspired by now whether it's Bach or Beethoven or any of the other great composers of History they have a they have a way that they they want this plate and the director when he chooses a part and he chooses maybe a an hour or two hour pieces to do he doesn't have a right to misinterpret it he doesn't have a right to rewrite it he has to keep it in the spirit of the way it's written there's a way that it's got to sound there's a way that it's got to be done and so he begins with the music and he begins to pick the greatest musicians in the world to play the part and and then the music or the instruments that they're playing they're not just some 10 cent piece they are the best pieces of horn or violin or flute or the drum they just don't go get yard sell pieces but they begin to bring and and every one of those musicians every one of them are gifted in life to be able to bring the best out of that instrument they're gifted in a certain way maybe some by a learned experience but most likely most of them have a gift that they were born in on the inside of their hearts like an artist or a poetry writer or a a real bride of Jesus Christ now these instruments being of the highest quality they've got to be taken care of and these men that that are gifted to be able to play ladies being able to play when they play the music they begin to bring that music to life maybe that music is 400 years old but it's still a masterpiece so now just laying in book form it'll lay dormant but if they can take their their part and they can realize I've got a part to play in this and they begin to bring that 400 that 400 year old music and bring It Forward are you with me they begin to bring it forward now listen a masterpiece is actually a piece of a of a composer's life he's actually poured his life in it no doubt he'll write thousands of pieces of music and be known for one it's like a preacher or like a songwriter or like a a singer many times great singers only produce one number one hit many preachers when they begin to preach they'll preach thousands of sermons but there'll be one that will be elevated even brother brandham will call the token his Masterpiece so you understand kind of what I'm saying right there now when that person is beginning to bring this m music forward they're bringing a gift on display sorry I'm just taking it just a bit now whether you're an organ player or where you're a guar player or are they your drunk player you're expressing a gift that is with from inside of you a preacher whether you preach to the nursing home or you preach conventions that's really not your gift that's God's Gift in you are you with me now whether it was Abraham or Noah or Elijah or nahome or even David when God begin to write about their lives you know God was quite wonderful in some of those places he wrote about their negative part or we would think we had to be angels can you imagine how difficult it was for Moses to write about himself having a high temper chassity when you met your brother the other day you didn't walk up to him in the first two minutes and go well there's some things that you're not going to like about me one's my [Applause] husband whether it was Joseph or David or Tamar or Ruth they were all displaying a part of God and your life whether you realize or not living right now in 2024 you are actually displaying a part of God are you with me you're more than just a name you're Christ on display well brother Ron I'm I'm 6 years old but your Christ on display as a six-year-old as a teenager you young ladies that are sitting here young men that are sitting here you're Christ at your age you're not a preacher or some some singer somewhere or another but you're Christ in school you're Christ on the job you're Christ with your friends are you with me now we instructed that we can't add to it or we can't take away from it we're instructed that we must keep the word pure and keep it holy and keep our lives that way I begin to look at some practices of procedures about about about Symphonies and the organizations of Symphonies and and to be a part of it and sister Cassie you're welcome to correct me if you if you would like to do that but if there is a vacancy in the National Symphony and they put forward that we need a a Pianist and and so what they do is they begin to send out word throughout the world we would like to have a a Pianist we'd like to have a certain pianist and and what they do is is they have blind auditions and then the blind auditions brother Jordan you're ahead of me stay with me and in the blind auditions they don't want to see your face right and they don't want to know who you are they don't want the appearance of your Humanity to affect their decision right of who can play the music the best and you will compete with thousands of people whether you know it or not so you have to make sure that you and the music are one that you and the music are one so when I hear I'll just use it like this when I hear Cassie play it isn't Cassie's opinion of the peace or her theory of the peace it's the peace and Cassy are one brother Brandon went to see uh and this might sound uh kind of new to you but brother random went to see the Ten Commandments 11 times because he didn't go to see Charleston hon he went to see Charleston hon had so laid himself aside until now Charleston hon was not himself anymore but now he Moses so when he steps out there gets the red see it's not Charleston hon it's Moses and this is little known fact but Charleston hon after the Moses was finished and the work was done and it was complete Charleston hon didn't know who Charleston hon was he had so stepped into the role Ron stay inead stay stay stay stay quiet for a minute Charles and hon had still stepped into the role he wasn't even himself anymore he was Moses and so he had to go to a facility to get himself called back to find out who he was so he could disattach himself from Moses you like it you like that so let's build a little bit more before we go too much further so each one of these individuals life so let's just say that Cassie wins the part so sister Cassie would be go to the National Orchestra and she would begin to play now 300 people is what I understand about 300 people are playing Cassie is not over top of all the 300 people she is complimentary to the rest of them now Cassie has got to find her place in the part it's got to find her place now it's phenomenal she's now been selected but now she's got to find her place and her position now they don't all get together 365 days a year to practice so they got to find the work that has been selected and they send theart heart and you've got to do that at home amen now to be a concert pianist you got to practice even with your husband is doing turkey calling in the other room and so she has to live that actually happened here folks cuz he wanted to make sure he sound like a turkey and so she literally throws herself into the music and listen that don't happen in five minutes there's no quick fixes stay with me on there's no quick fixes here you just don't walk into church and sit down and all of a sudden you're bride [Applause] material there's a lot of work you got to get yourself out of the way and cast has to figure out sitting at that piano I dare not touch it but she has to figure out I've got to make this music live I got to make it live I got to make it sound like it's supposed to sound when he wrote it down whether it's bethoven or Bach or any of the others when they wrote it they had a certain thought in their mind that it would sound this certain way she has no right to rewrite it well this note would sound better maybe Bob turn maybe Trinity she doesn't have a right to to write anything there of her own self that's right and she's got to make sure that when she plays that people are not here in Cassie they're not here in Cassie but they're hearing bethoven life that's right Lord is this okay I I didn't disappoint you I didn't I didn't play now symphony is more than just one person now all the one the one person fulfillments has already happened in Wigan brandham there's no more prophets coming and there's no more Great Men coming and we're not looking for the next Mister we're not building kingdoms here we're expanding so your children can sit here when they get 21 look around these little guys are going to be married and they're going to be having babies and it'll happen Quicken so I can't just look at you now I got to look at you whether I'm here or whether I'm not here I got a plan so when I when I got a dining room table I brother Connie told me she said that's too big that's too big it's got 18 chairs yeah yeah I I I need we're going to need a big table well she was thinking about Matthew Andrew and Whitney and then there come a stinking guy and then there came girls amen and then there came babies amen and now the table's full and now we set out other tables and set out chairs that's what we're doing here we're going to need a bigger table here once again you can correct me it's me and Cassie having a sermon this week she didn't didn't know it and here we are now a a symphony is made up of four different sections or four different movements now each movement has its own structure and its own format the first you may have to help me say some of these names the first uses a quick Tempo it's setting the pace and I'm not going to even attempt to say the word that goes behind it but it's it uses a Sonata and an a l l EEG r o Allegro I should have known that I took [Applause] Allegra has nothing to do with a leg R you've been here for a month or two we're really glad to have you but you've already figured out by now I don't have a PhD degree here now the second movement is slower and more lyrical because it's a more of a feeling type of music and I'm not going to call out because I got a great big list here I'm not going to call out all of the the pieces of music that is filling the second movement or even the third M movement is a menuette or SC h e r zo o sh sharo Scaro Scaro don't that sound Scaro and the final movement often uses a Sonata or an Allegro it went well that time didn't it now all of these make up a symphony now in each every one of them there are leaders and there's I'll just use one there's there's what they call the first chair and the first chair is the lead musician maybe to a certain set of horns all of them are playing the same type of horns but the first chair he's there because he is the best and he can make that music come alive now then there what I've read and I've done my best but there can be as many as 10 that are actually right in with him playing the same piece of music and the same instrument but none of them have the right to take the other one's place that's right none of them have the right to go off on their own none of them have the right to interpret the music in the own way one might come from France and another come from Nigeria but they're playing the same music they're playing the same music whether it's Bach Beethoven or the message of the hour everyone has a responsibility to sub subdue themselves I've got it written right here to subdue themselves and become a prisoner to the position whether ate a hamburger or a hot dog or a egg salad sandwich that morning it doesn't have anything to do once they sat down there is a dress code there is a dress code and it says it right here for for 99 % it's called tuxedo for a man and formal ladies wear and it says that dresses for the women that's not a yard sale dress and that's not a yard sale tuxedo I begin to go and take a look at just how much some of these individuals had to spend oh yeah just to dress a certain part and listen their part in the entire Symphony may not cover that or it may be that big but you're still aart are you with me now you said well brother Ron especially when you're young in the in the message and you're just coming in what's the important part about dresswear you're presenting Jesus Christ and if wants me to dress a certain way I want to dress a certain way and then it has to do not just with dresswear but it has to do with Attitude can I can I just read one of of the number one rules amen leave your arrogance at the door let's give the Lord a big hand right [Applause] there well if I hope that didn't hurt your feelings but this ain't about you that's right I want to tell you this church is not about me I'm only a musician [Music] here brother Jim's working at my house he comes he comes by my office he said what are you doing I said I'm working it don't look like a preacher's working when he's sitting reading but he's working amen cuz he got to get his out of the way amen and when you get yourself out of the way it isn't about you it's about him and you want to make sure your front sight and your back site is exactly lined up so you can hit the target it's got to be on the mark and as a minister not only is it got to be on the mark you got to have the right attitude CA a Ministry in a bad attitude will cause every one of you agitated you'll come you're wanting to be moved by the Holy Spirit you're wanting to be motivated so you can take on next week but if that man of God regardless of who he is if he hasn't got his out of the way are you with me let me just use myself for example let me just say some weeks I have difficult weeks some weeks I have bad days some days I have good days some mornings I'll get up on Sunday morning to preach and I'll feel absolutely horrible wanting to go back to bed you don't need to hear all about that I tell you some of those things so you'll pray for me but let me just say this you that should not affect the music cuz God's greater than cancer God's greater than your problems you mind if I just go through some of the the rules for getting ready amen arrive early you think it that was for church come prepared have music responsibility be courteous to your colleagues amen be courteous to your colleagues I'm talking to the people on the internet be courteous to your colleagues all of you work jobs and you've when somebody walked through the door and shut the door you know what kind of attitude that they were in how many of you had one of them in your life hopefully it's not your wife don't tune your instrument too loudly don't chat don't tune your instrument too loudly you can answer it just fine don't chat well brother Ron I I I've been playing music with this guy for 10 years listen we came for a symphony not to talk about your tomatoes if you're using a it's here if you're using a bow instrument don't hit the person beside you know who your leader is don't try to outdo them you know this one must have been important leave your arrogance at the door this is not the place to tell your life story the mission of the symphony is to bring the music piece to life Hallelujah now you can breathe deep it's going to be okay now I've laid out the foundation brother man said when Jesus when he was on Earth they couldn't understand his ministry it was too great it was a phenomena they just couldn't a phenomena he said they couldn't understand him but he said search the scriptures search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they the Sheep mucus is telling you I'm he the scripture is telling you I'm fulfilling the part let me just go out on a limb the scriptures is telling you that I am the Bride of Jesus Christ this is our time this is our life right God allotted the word and he said that day was to be the manifestation of God God Emmanuel with us his name Shall be Called wonderful and counselor the Prince of Peace the Mighty God the Everlasting father and his name Shall be Called Emmanuel God With Us and God was in David and God was in Moses and and that's God all the way through manifested himself for the age but this age a virgin shall conceive and shall bring forth a son and he will be God With Us are you with me how many scriptures do we have Mary being tormented by all of her enemies all of her critics I'd say less than one Jesus being homeless just only a handful of scriptures yet he owned it all Isaiah 53 and we all need the scripture who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plet as a root out of dry ground and he hath no form or cess and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as if it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he hath borne our griefs carried our sorrows listen all of those things were going to be a part of our music they're going to be a part of our lives but they are not the important part all of us are going to have trouble so does the world all of us are going to have Sorrows so does the world all of us are going to be grief stricken so does the world but the difference is he's in our boat [Music] [Applause] I don't know how people face whatever they face without God I I I I I just have to be honest with you what some people face I don't understand how they get through it without God are you with me you can get down on your knees and pray not through a preacher but you can pray you can pray and and sometimes your your prayers don't feel like they hit the ceiling sometimes it feels like the clouds are wide open and you're talking to God himself and you get a warm tingly s sensation and you know everything's going to be okay God hears amen God hears every time you [Applause] pray there will be times that you walk in here and you walk out feeling like you're Rapture and there'll be times you walk in you walk out well I just must not have got what I needed to what made the difference it wasn't a preacher it was you and you can always look back and go was I prepared are you with me just hold that just for few moments I was a chimne chimney sweep I actually started in 1989 and I started like everybody else I just kind of started out just working trying to pray the phone ring and I went to a very large old house it was couple hundred years old and I met a man there he was a skinny sort of fell he was tall skinny had really dark eyes and really dark hair and if I can just say it properly he was a hippie type and so he he told me he Saidi want you to tell me exactly how these chimneys need to be restored in the right way he said ' now you may not be able to do it and I'm really not expecting you to do it but I'd like for you to clean my chimney and tell me exactly how to make them right back to where they were when they were built and so I gave him some instructions and he said now you know I know you don't want to touch the brick work or the mortar work and you you don't want to do that you don't have the time to do that and I understand he said but I need Lids to put on top of these chimneys you remember his name was Barry hop and so I uh nothing wrong with my memory today and so so anyway I I gave him I gave him a an estimate of cost and so brother Thomas you know sometimes you meet that customer and you go they can't afford this and and so I be to talk to Barry and I said now this is going to cost pretty good money here I said and that day it was a couple, and so I said we're just going to put Lids on it and we're going to we're going to put a vent cap that will go up and down and so when you need a vent you can open it up or you can you can close it down and you don't want it seen by the interstate going by you and I said Barry C can you afford this he said well I think so and I said I said Barry I I hate to be I hate to be uh inquisitive in your Affairs but you know when I get the work done I I need to know that you can afford this I said what do you do he said well I'm a I'm a restorer that's my job I'm a restorer I'm going somewhere this goes with the sermon and he said I'm a restorer he said now in restoration you got to bring it back to the way it was originally and you got to you got to the guy that built it you got to find out what his intricate details that he likes and so you got to go back and do it exactly like he did it he said let me show you a piece of artwork that I'm working on and I walk in and there's a piece of artwork and it's a it's a family sitting around a table and there's there's there's fruit on the table and it's it's really nice nice and it's got certain jugs on the table and certain things and and it's had some water damage and he said I have been assigned to restore this piece of art to where that it's like its original texture and he he began to explain something to you and this will fit in the sermon so he said I got to figure out exactly and analyze this canvas exactly what it's made of and then I've got to find out exactly the the the ink that was used and the paint that was used and I got to find the brush and not just the brush but the hairs have got to be exactly like that and even the stem's got to be right because I got to study the artist and his stroke and I got to stroke it exactly like he stroked it and I and he said now now here's the the detail of it if I don't get the right texture or if I don't get the right pain or if I I don't get the right stroke and if I don't do it a certain way and let it age a certain way I Mar the Masterpiece now he said for this piece of work I I'll get a million dollars and I felt about that tall asking him for $2,000 for a piece of metal on the top of his roof amen he said Ron I'd like for you to come and see this house when it's restored so you can see my work two years later they called us and so I went back and there was there was listen and I'm going to say it lightly there was probably 50 people there for open house and I had an invitation you had to have an invitation to go I showed up in my red because it was Christmas time I showed up in my red Santa Claus chimney cleaning outfit and when I get there I park where I'm supposed to park and I'm greeted by the University of North Carolina and Duke University is there UVA is there they have their representatives and in in in art and also in engineering and they're all there and I walk up a walkway that was not there before but it is an elegant detail and I walk up to a brand new porch and I walk up I walk up to the door and I walk in and sign in and it don't look like the same house that I walked in two years ago the sheetrock was made out of pig hair and so he had to go get Farmers that would take care of the pigs and when they got ready to to cut the pigs they had to do it a certain way so the hair wasn't coat and then he would mix it in the mud so it would be a certain way on the walls am and you know at the end of it this really struck me and he came over and asked me said how you like it I said I I feel like I've stepped back in time he said that's exactly where you need to feel you're standing 200 years ago and friends have came over for the first time and you're seeing the house that's right and he said Ron if you'll remember the conversation that we had when we first met he said you remember that piece of artwork he said I don't have the right to sign my name at the bottom of it that's right he said I have restored this house to the original Builder and he said nowhere will you find my name nowhere will you find my name attached to how I built it I had to do it exactly the way it ought to be done oh God help us as ministers oh God help us as a people sitting here at Full Gospel Lighthouse Tabernacle it wasn't built for the kingdom of Homer Frasier it wasn't built for the kingdom of Ron Spencer it wasn't built for the kingdom God help us brother on this is what I think this ought to be done and this is how I think the church ought to be run who cares who cares well don't preach this part of the message I got news for you you're not my [Applause] bus I believe every word in this book I believe every quote in this message but God's not coming back for this book he's not coming back for our tape libraries and our books and our pictures on the wall listen The Three Squirrels they will not be raptured the four 42in caribo will not be raptured the Silver Tip grizzly bear will not be P raptured Blondie that was brother brandom's favorite gun will go through the tribulation period the rock that had Eagle in it and they tore that out we'll have to go through a restoration to be in the new world to come so will me and you we got to be Washed by the Water of the [Music] [Applause] word now I want to just can I go just a few more minutes every one of us around the world whether you're a church of five or 10 or 10,000 amen we're all a body whether you sit in the first chair or the 15th chair you got to take time to know the materialen that's right oh yeah yes you can't show up at the symphony and there's the place to learn the message let's just think about this CH for a little while 3,000 people are coming to watch the average ticket is $119 and they ask you to wear formal a power to just come to listen there's no chatter they even have instructions you think we're tough here come on you think we're tough here they have Specific Instructions if your baby cries out immediately move the child and get it into amen listen I just listen to your children crying I know you'll do the right thing but I hear growth in this church amen we said at whis's the other day yeah we go to wh's we sat at whis's the other day and there was a minister sitting there and he was talking to somebody across and he didn't know we were preachers at all and he said he was sitting there and he said our church is dead he said we laid off two preachers he said we laid off the the youth pastor because we have absolutely no youth our church is dying amen and he said we're working ourself out of a job I'll tell you why he don't have life they don't have a life I'll tell you what's going on here is life life Hallelujah life is happening that's why there's amens and shouting Hallelujah and praising God and worshiping God and [Applause] music are you with me but listen that don't start at church musicians I want to talk to you take time at home to get to know the author of the book let him come into your room and that warm presence pray read your Bible listen to the word [Applause] and here's some words I wanted you to pray father forgive me I want you to pray these words I Surrender myself to you not to a man but I Surrender myself Jesus used me Jesus use me now so many times we're distracted I'm sorry I'm just going to take a few more minutes we're distracted because it's the enemy's job to do every one of us are on different levels that's right duh we're all growing right how's been here less than six months yeah we're really glad to have you we're really glad to have you and if you're listening and you're tuning and you're you're listening some of the musicians sitting beside of you they're going to hit the wrong note now and then and they're going every one of us are going through different things because it's called life it's called life it's go life and so as we're going through there's going to be some spots that you you got to overlook certain things that's right come on am I with you I'm just going to talk to you it's kind of like your wife when you first got married and she made gravy it wasn't your mama's oh come on if you got any brains between your ears you do not bring a [Music] mama she bakes biscuits for the first time and they're that tall they're harder than a baseball bat just put more jelly on it Matthew says it and it's worthy to be said shut that mouth that's right now your goal is to have a lifelong marriage amen not to die and bury you next week so there's going to be some spots that you're going to see that are kind of imperfections that's right when she says do I look big in this dress don't even breathe that requires another [Applause] drink what does that have to do with a symphony brother Ron we're all together we're not here to poke and fuss and be a cactus one to another we're not here to have a lecture on what we don't like you got to find Common Ground are you with me now oh yeah and above all things love one another the guy walking in and he's paid $119 for his suit he's got a bow tie on I was tempted to wear a bow tiee today he brings his wife in in formal attire and they have an assigned seat 67a and 67b you know he don't know who's sitting beside of him he don't know what their job is but they all have a like they like Orchestra they're not there to have a conversation about how many kids they got what kind of car they drive right they've came to the orchestra some of those seats are as much as $1,100 if you're sitting in $1,100 seat and you're sitting there and you got a blabber moue sitting beside of you brother Ron you ever been there yeah I was actually it wasn't your turn I I was actually on a plane one day and I was actually sitting listening and I was listening to this and this guy was telling me his life story I was sitting in first class and and he was just rattling off he was drinking little bottles about that big and it was making him talk and finally I said you I I I said sir I just need to talk to you a minute we're on a 13-hour trip I said I need to talk to you a minute I paid extra to sit in this seat this seat will lay back and I can go to sleep but I will not be able to accomplish that with your mouth amen well brother Ron that was rude I have a rule I hurt your feelings once or I have to hurt them later amen what'd he do he shut that mouth and for the next 12 hours I was able to rest are you with me so you show up at the symphony and all of a sudden that ain't what we came for right that ain't what we came for there's a guy where you hide them sticks I can play this well I can't see but I can play this I picked two of the same it's pretty incredible and there's a guy comes out and there's there's generally about an hour prep right before people come out they warm themselves up call it what do you call it warming the lips and they start ready to ready to play and they're getting ready and you know it sounds like a bunch of nonsense it you know you know all of these people are warming up and warming up and you think what in the world is going to go on here and I paid this money to sit here and they're they're all they come into their places and some comes a little different times than others they all come to their place the leader will begin to make sure that all of his groups in line the guy with a triangle the guy the guy in the back with the drums most generally there's several sets of drums all of them have certain characteristics that they play with there's a guy comes out in the tuxedo most of the time they got bushy hair I don't know what that deal is but as a guy comes out I let mine grow I had be bushy he comes out and he gets a stick and that stick absolutely means something if you're part of the players it absolutely means something and every time he moves it in a certain way it's designed to do certain things to bring certain emphasis on certain music and then he begins to bring it forth he will turn introduce himself to the audience it's not about him he has selected now 300 people from all over the world they are the best of the best this is not the day that you practice I'm winding up now this is not the day that you practice this is the day that you're at your best the background story don't matter whatsoever the weather outside don't matter whatsoever today this song is about when the rooll is Called Up Yonder I'll be there and he begins to wave his sticks and he'll take you from deity of Jesus Christ all the way through communion and no matter how long you've been in the symphony it's as fresh to you as the first time you heard it and why does that director get so excited amen why does he get so excited because he has been inspired by the music he knows how it needs to sound he knows I have gathered the best of the best of the best and now they have come at Peak efficiency and it's not about one it's about 300 we're going to bring this to life if I could name a few names now William brandham is standing just beyond the realm and this message was not just to be in tape and book form it's to be in human vessels to overcome Le oia not to be diminished or to be deluded or to be watered down it's Jesus Christ in every one of us 6y old 14 years old 21 years old 90 years old I got good news for you we're going to [Music] overcome we're not waiting on a man to direct it the Holy Ghost is here that's right that's right the Holy Ghost is here so brother Randall when we come to a difficult spot in music it isn't the music that's wrong it's we so we pray that our attitude will change because the music's not going to change that's right and remember this how important you are it wasn't you chose God it wasn't you chose God God chose you I want that settle in I'm going to take one more minute if I can when I was a little bitty boy was four years old when we walked by a casket in Jeffersonville Indiana my daddy told me that William brandham is a prophet we went to the Jeffersonville meetings every Easter to listen to a tape until 1977 there was a certain year that we went and we didn't have a place to set in the building and I was about 11 years old and Doc brandom he loved dad and he said would you would you would you feel would you feel okay if we sit in the in the baptistry big white baptistry and dad took me around Mark stayed with Mom and so dad walked me around and we went down the steps and sit in the Baptist tree now here's how things work I was sitting in the baptistry and there's a curtain right in front of me and we heard the prophet speak by tape and sitting directly where that curtain come together was an 18-year-old boy that I would later meet as an older man and his name was Tim prit and all the other meetings that he had went to preacher set on the platform so when he walks in he thinks it's his thing to do is to go up and set on the platform so he goes and sits on the platform and he sits right in the crease of that curtain and sitting behind him in the baptistry was 11-year-old boy named Ron Spencer we were in the same Symphony how old are you Chaz 49 I'm going to be an old gal next year she won't get offended but I want you to just think in a matter of a few minutes everything changed in your life everything changed what will it be like brother Ron when a resurrected saints come back they can't wait till we finish and we can't wait till we see them brother on how are we ever going to get all these things figured out don't worry just keep playing the symphony just keep playing once on the music is it okay to tell the story I'm overtime now Stephen went to Brother Josh's Bennett's place when I walked in brother Josh's office last year when I was helping preach his meeting brother Josh has a man in his church that bills he bills uh a a certain style furniture he puts a deer head in it piece of metal he puts all different kind of things in it and I was just odd I I couldn't hardly look at the brothers by looking at this piece of art and this man had quit his job to take care of his wife who's now an invilet and to make extra money not in some great big building but in his yard he creates Masterpiece work I want you to go get that knife the knife that's sitting on it's actually it's in a box now I boxed it up and I just said boy that's beautiful that's an incredible thing Jos said would you like for him to build you one I said oh I couldn't ask for something like that that's Masterpiece he went down he had alterior motiv but he went down and he called me the other day wanted to called Andrew said can I come by your house I got something for brother Ron I no idea what he what he was bringing I didn't even know where you went shame on you supposed to tell me and so anyway he he says brother Ron and I go out to greet him I thought maybe he's going to give me some coffee and I go out to greet him and and he he begins to pull this piece out and it's a maybe I'll bring a picture in a couple weeks it's a picture of a it's it's a it's an artwork of a deer 10-point deer and on the top of that 10-point deer is a mouse and it's all made out of metal and I mean these animals look alive the deer's carcass but but all of them look alive and there's a snake at the bottom rattlesnake slithering and there's a tree that's there and on the top of the tree it's one of the most PE beautiful pieces of wood that were put together it was trash wood trash wood that he took and made new again you have thought it was a piece of art and then there's this snake on the on on the bottom and this deer head laid over like this and on the top of the deer head there's a mouse and then there's a tree of life that is holding this piece of wood up I said well there's got to be a story to this now here's a man taking care of his wife that must be taken care of he's quit his job a good paying job to be able to take care of his wife and in the time that he can he builds these masterpieces works of art and I'm that Mouse on that on that on that deer head at antler I'm that mou house on that antler and that snake can't get to me because I'm too close to the Tree of Life what that man did the music of his life sets in my living room as a masterpiece and you know what the key of it is I don't even know what the man looks like I've never shook his hand but I've seen his [Applause] work last night this was brought to to me in the back room you mind if I just tell a couple more stories your roast won't burn too bad brother Jonathan that likes Charity Siler sister Connie helps me talk he wanted to do something special for me so he got a knife made by a company called black mumba and it's supposed to be a very special metal and they made this knife especially for me amen Jonathan didn't bring it but he sent it has a really nice display case that goes with it Jonathan was here in a prayer line last year and God touched his life so he wanted to do something special and Gabriel thought it was a special knife so being a special knife it wasn't going to be used on deer and bear and turkey I hadn't have much luck with turkey so he put the cloud on the knife and that makes it even more special reason I'm telling you that is Jonathan didn't come and delivered himself he sent it like God sent his word and whether you see him or whether you feel him it's a masterpiece and when God showed us a vision of coming here to be the pastor he didn't show me you as a crowd he just and I I didn't know these these boys would be working with me but all I knew was it was God's purpose and plan and if I'm to be in this part of the symphony I want to do the best job that I know how to do I've told you about a chair and I I told you about the Masterpiece of that work and I've showed you this boy I bet that means a lot to you brother Ron yeah it does you was in my office yesterday brother Marcus and there's a basket that's got a got a policeman's outfit with a badge and with a gun and a hat and it's it's in that basket now it didn't look like much to you no doubt it's just throwed down in there there's a fireman's outfit and there's a nurse's outfit that's in there you know where I'm going come here Isaac oh come on Zoe come on no she ain't coming but this is the guy that brings that policeman and Fire truck and race cars and baseball and soccer and football them deer on the wall they won't move I'm doing something I'm finishing but this guy brings all of that to life they're shooting and houses being a ball that was on the floor all of a sudden is coming at me at 25 miles an hour catch it PA paa I see two balls so I got to aim I got to thank you there's books on that shelf back there the message is on most of your phones the greatest trophy that God has brother Doug that's how special you are in the symphony amen God couldn't take you too early we still needed you amen let's stand to her feet do hallelujah hallelujah doing the joy of [Applause] that I why don't you turn to your neighbor and say welcome to the symphony hallelujah hallelujah When the Roll is Called Up Yonder I'll be there
