[36:42] amen
[36:43] amen we love you with all of our hearts
[36:45] and just good to be here in it
[36:48] amen maybe just for a moment
[36:54] amen
[36:57] when andrew announced that we will not
[36:59] have
[37:00] service on christmas night
[37:03] i i was scared that he would announce
[37:05] that christmas is canceled
[37:08] i walk out to an empty building
[37:14] amen
[37:15] so love you with all of our hearts and
[37:17] so glad to see you each and every one of
[37:19] you
[37:20] and uh
[37:21] so glad to have you here
[37:23] i would like for you to to thank you for
[37:25] everything that you do
[37:27] every prayer that you pray
[37:29] and uh i thought last night was just an
[37:31] epic night
[37:33] i i to me that was probably my favorite
[37:36] sermon that i've heard from andrew
[37:38] and uh it was just it was just powerful
[37:42] right to the point
[37:43] and uh it was just awesome we want to
[37:46] remember brother william this week as he
[37:48] goes to his father's funeral his father
[37:52] died died of als
[37:54] and suffered just a short time with it
[37:57] but
[37:58] was it months it was like months with it
[38:00] yeah
[38:02] we remember that disease as being one of
[38:05] the most horrible diseases there is
[38:07] uh brother steve suffered with that
[38:09] disease and it's a disease that death
[38:12] becomes a very close friend and so
[38:15] and so we want to remember brother
[38:17] wiggum's family
[38:18] that god would just be with them
[38:21] and if every one of them is like brother
[38:22] william
[38:24] they're princes of a family
[38:26] amen i i i just we're so thrilled we're
[38:29] so benefited to having brother william
[38:32] and his wife and family with us the
[38:34] ministry that he brings the presence
[38:37] that he has
[38:38] uh we we so appreciate that
[38:41] and and and just just for just a moment
[38:44] let me just say this to you
[38:46] his daddy's life will live on
[38:50] in his family
[38:52] and and so his daddy was a voice of god
[38:56] translator
[38:57] and
[38:58] and so
[38:59] he translated for for 27 years
[39:03] and
[39:03] that is a tremendous responsibility
[39:06] within itself
[39:08] and just to give you an idea every word
[39:11] every comma
[39:13] everything has to be right
[39:15] and it can't have any of your own
[39:17] personal persuasion inside of it or
[39:20] ability to change it so
[39:22] his daddy was a businessman his daddy
[39:25] was a lot of things in life but what
[39:27] we'll live on
[39:28] is his daddy's work
[39:31] and that's what we're doing and
[39:33] and i'm prefacing all of that this
[39:35] morning
[39:37] that's what he will be remembered for
[39:40] and he has a tremendous family
[39:42] and uh i i was just sharing a couple of
[39:45] things with him
[39:46] uh andrew was singing out here and i
[39:48] said you know this message lives
[39:52] if it was all about the original
[39:54] generation and their experience
[39:57] then the next generation if they didn't
[40:00] have an experience it wouldn't live
[40:04] it just wouldn't live it's like for your
[40:06] children they've got to get the holy
[40:08] ghost for their self and every
[40:10] generation's got to have a revival if
[40:13] not they will just have a church entity
[40:16] and and it won't live on monday
[40:19] and then it won't live on tuesday and so
[40:22] and then it will just be a story book
[40:25] of the message or a storybook of the
[40:27] bible and and we don't want a tradition
[40:31] we want life
[40:33] and it's not just for our family but our
[40:35] family's family and our children's
[40:37] children
[40:38] god's going to have a rapture
[40:41] and in that rapture there's going to be
[40:43] children that are literally infants
[40:46] changed in the moment in the twinkling
[40:47] of an eye
[40:49] there's going to be teenagers that are
[40:50] going to have the holy ghost that's
[40:53] going to get a translation and be moved
[40:56] from this dimension to another dimension
[40:59] we're we're we're seeing it happen we're
[41:02] not just
[41:03] looking for it to come but we're seeing
[41:05] it happen around the world and
[41:08] and so we're just thankful for that
[41:11] uh i just want to say william we're
[41:13] praying for you and he's going to he's
[41:16] going to be speaking in that
[41:18] brother williams father would watch him
[41:20] preach and i'm sure
[41:22] from here and when when william would
[41:23] speak that his father was extremely
[41:26] proud of him and exp extremely proud of
[41:29] what the young man that he has become
[41:31] and so
[41:32] amen so god bless you brother william as
[41:34] you take your journey and and uh and we
[41:37] just will be praying for you as you
[41:39] speak there
[41:40] and those that do speak brother william
[41:43] is the only
[41:44] he's out of 12 children
[41:47] and 13 children god bless you
[41:52] and he's the only son that's a minister
[41:56] and so i'm sure as he watched his son
[41:59] preach
[42:00] that meant the world
[42:02] to him
[42:04] amen that's where i wanted to go with
[42:06] that by the way and god bless you
[42:08] amen
[42:10] i am supposed to be at brother danny
[42:12] stevens today
[42:13] this weekend
[42:15] and
[42:16] due to a variety of reasons
[42:19] i'm not there
[42:21] and because of some of the treatments
[42:23] that we're doing and because of my

[43:40] he's doing and so
[43:42] amen these brothers all they all are
[43:45] very
[43:46] uh thoughtful and and appreciative and
[43:48] uh they've been very understanding when
[43:51] when we've had to cancel and
[43:53] and so we appreciate your prayers we're
[43:57] we're we're we're just we're just in
[43:59] that season of our life and we're in a
[44:02] battle and we're in a war and we
[44:04] continue to take the chemo treatments
[44:06] every day it's on in the morning and
[44:08] then about about about eight hours later
[44:11] we take our second chemo treatment
[44:14] that second one's gen generally a booger
[44:17] but uh we we god's give us strength and
[44:20] we got news this week that we're getting
[44:22] ready to have to start another type of
[44:24] chemo treatment on top of the one that
[44:26] we're already on i don't know why i just
[44:29] know that we're we're in a battle
[44:31] and uh
[44:32] and uh they say it's pretty rough deal
[44:35] but you know hey this one was supposed
[44:36] to be a real rough deal too so
[44:39] god's given strength he's give us mercy
[44:42] and i've been asked about the pen that i
[44:44] that i have on my jacket and then i'll
[44:46] just take a minute this is okay
[44:48] the pen i carry on my i have on my
[44:50] jacket is a hope pen
[44:52] and the cancer has struck a lot of
[44:54] people in life and
[44:55] and so
[44:57] we need hope we need strength and so if
[45:00] i can be a if i can be a help to anybody
[45:02] in the world that maybe don't even
[45:04] believe the message but they hear our
[45:06] story and so
[45:07] and so i i was just sitting in the in
[45:10] the waiting room the other day for two
[45:11] hours
[45:12] and it was two old fellas sitting in
[45:14] there and they were talking about what a
[45:15] tough time that they were having and and
[45:18] they were just really giving it some
[45:19] complaining and
[45:21] they were going on one was about 80 one
[45:23] was about 65 and they were talking about
[45:25] how difficult time they were having and
[45:28] they had cancer in their eye and so
[45:30] we were in the eye clinic and and we
[45:32] were there and so i just kind of let
[45:34] them go we were there for a couple hours
[45:36] together and so they were just going
[45:39] they were both neighbors from
[45:41] mechanicsville and which is down below
[45:43] richmond
[45:44] and they were sitting there and they
[45:46] they just kind of related a lot of old
[45:48] times and so
[45:50] you know after a bit they were
[45:51] complaining quite a bit and he finally
[45:53] the old fellow looked over at and said
[45:54] what are you here for i said well i had
[45:56] cancer in my eye and i said then monitor
[45:58] it i said but the cancer went from my
[46:01] eye to my lymph nodes and then to my
[46:02] lungs and then to my brain
[46:05] and i said i'm on chemo twice a day and
[46:07] the old guy looked over to the other guy
[46:09] and he said
[46:10] no more complaining
[46:14] amen
[46:16] no more complaining
[46:18] amen god bless you
[46:19] amen i love you hope you don't mind me
[46:21] taking a couple of moments there
[46:24] i i wore the suit last night that uh
[46:27] brother george quinn gave me
[46:29] uh many years ago maybe eight years ago
[46:32] in in ireland and today i'm wearing his
[46:35] ties so so maybe so this is the george
[46:38] quinn weekend so
[46:40] amen god bless you if you will stand
[46:41] with me this morning
[46:44] i certainly love you with all of our
[46:46] hearts and
[46:47] and we want to pray for the meetings
[46:49] that are upcoming and all that's going
[46:51] on did i miss anything andrew
[46:54] all right all right
[46:56] god bless you
[46:59] first john chapter 1 and verse 1
[47:03] i visited this subject it came to me in
[47:06] 2015
[47:08] and so i want to revisit and speak to
[47:11] you from
[47:12] from where i'm standing
[47:14] and i want to speak to you in in as
[47:17] brief as i can on
[47:19] what will you be remembered for
[47:22] sister cassie wrote a
[47:24] song from this this sermon
[47:27] then
[47:28] after delivering this sermon and maybe
[47:30] this will be your case today
[47:33] after delivering this sermon in
[47:34] switzerland one of the greatest miracles
[47:37] that i've ever personally saw and
[47:40] witnessed took place at the end of the
[47:42] service with brother bisical
[47:45] and so
[47:46] this sermon has power so if you can just
[47:49] pay close attention and pull on the word
[47:51] this morning
[47:52] amen just feeling very led and and just
[47:56] waited on this day
[47:57] and we will go back and revisiting
[48:00] last week's sermon again
[48:02] but i just felt to drop this today and
[48:04] so so we believe it's of the lord first
[48:07] john chapter 1 and verse 1
[48:10] that which was from the beginning
[48:14] which we have heard
[48:17] which we have seen with our eyes
[48:20] which we have looked upon
[48:22] and our hands have handled
[48:25] the word of life
[48:27] that's an eternal word
[48:30] for the life was manifested and we have
[48:33] seen it and bear witness
[48:36] and show unto you that eternal life
[48:39] which was
[48:40] with the father
[48:42] and was manifested
[48:45] unto us
[48:47] that which we have seen
[48:50] and heard
[48:52] declare we unto you that
[48:54] ye also may have fellowship with us
[48:58] and truly our fellowship is with the
[49:00] father and with his son jesus christ
[49:04] and these things right we unto you
[49:07] that your joy
[49:09] may be full
[49:11] maybe have a need on your heart you just
[49:12] like to lift it before the lord today
[49:14] and say lord come touch my heart today
[49:17] lord jesus we love you with all of our
[49:20] hearts and
[49:21] lord we can just feel your presence even
[49:23] now
[49:24] we ask you that you would minister to us
[49:26] you see our hands lifted requests behind
[49:29] every hand loved ones
[49:32] job situations spiritual conditions
[49:35] father you're a god that takes a service
[49:37] and
[49:38] and just answers in so many ways
[49:42] i ask you for strength in my body today
[49:44] i ask you that you would anoint us today
[49:47] lord may my mind be sharp and clear help
[49:50] us today we pray in jesus christ's name
[49:53] we ask amen and amen and amen god bless
[49:56] you you may be seated
[50:02] what will you be remembered for
[50:08] it's quite a powerful thought
[50:11] because a man lives his life and
[50:13] sometimes it's short sometimes it's very
[50:15] brief sometimes it's extended but if you
[50:19] lived a hundred years
[50:21] it's very brief in the time of eternity
[50:24] millionaires have lived their life and
[50:26] been great businessmen
[50:29] this actually the serve this actual
[50:31] sermon came to me when i was standing in
[50:33] the grave
[50:35] of of where
[50:37] that columbus church was at
[50:40] and i was standing in front of a
[50:42] deacon's
[50:43] a deacon's grave
[50:46] and that's
[50:47] that's been
[50:48] about 14 to 1500 years ago
[50:52] and i and and and i was standing in
[50:54] front of it and and no no way in the
[50:57] world his name was already at a point to
[50:59] where you couldn't read it because time
[51:01] had taken away and
[51:03] but at the bottom of it of the deacon of
[51:05] the church
[51:06] and i thought
[51:08] what a statement that is made
[51:12] i was a standard of this church the
[51:15] message of the hour at that time
[51:18] and i was a
[51:19] i i was a pillar of this church it don't
[51:23] talk about his business it don't talk
[51:25] about his lifestyle it don't talk about
[51:27] his children and don't even talk about
[51:30] his wife
[51:33] god sometimes will allow chapters even
[51:35] books to be written in the bible
[51:38] as
[51:39] it's more than a history book
[51:41] the greatest book that's ever been
[51:43] written god will allow men their name
[51:46] their temporary life
[51:49] their their names like moses it'll it'll
[51:51] encompass books
[51:53] david will be mentioned in many books of
[51:56] the bible
[51:58] elijah
[51:59] and all of those but there's men like
[52:02] shamgar that will be mentioned in one
[52:05] scripture
[52:08] and and the prophet would go back and
[52:10] grab his name
[52:12] now now their life
[52:14] you would want to know that about the
[52:17] eternal part of them
[52:20] what they did what their job was you
[52:22] don't know too much about
[52:24] only unless it's written
[52:27] but in our day
[52:30] what will you and i be remembered for
[52:34] i certainly hope that i won't be
[52:37] remembered as a as a a fighter of cancer
[52:41] amen
[52:42] i i just have to say this and i i just
[52:45] thought i i'd like to have a statement
[52:47] written
[52:48] and i and i just i just came to this
[52:50] thought and i thought i would deliver it
[52:52] i'm honored
[52:54] in all of this journey that i've been on
[52:58] that god had confidence
[53:02] that i would fight this battle
[53:05] and i would not give in and i would not
[53:07] i would not worship the spirit of cancer
[53:11] but i would contest it and fight it
[53:14] every day
[53:16] and it would be a journey that i would
[53:18] be on and that journey is good days bad
[53:22] days
[53:23] for an example thursday was a horrendous
[53:26] day for me but that didn't make me quit
[53:29] church last night
[53:32] you get back up and you fight through
[53:34] the day
[53:38] i'm reminded that it was in a cave we
[53:40] don't need a thousand people with us but
[53:43] it was in a cave with two incredible
[53:45] beings
[53:47] one was the angel of the lord and the
[53:49] other was the prophet to this age
[53:51] and he was reminded that if you can get
[53:54] the people to believe
[53:57] if you can get them to believe
[54:00] now i understand even the disease that i
[54:03] thought
[54:05] was mentioned
[54:07] by brother brennaman not the angel
[54:11] not even cancer would stand before the
[54:13] prayers
[54:15] so this disease does not have eternal
[54:18] value to it
[54:21] are you with me
[54:23] so we raise our head
[54:25] above the disease that we fought
[54:30] and
[54:30] and and i just i just want to relay this
[54:33] to you if you'll remember before the
[54:35] journey even started or we knew that we
[54:37] had it god spoke to us and said
[54:40] if you'll trust me
[54:44] i'll use you like never before
[54:47] now i want you to just think and i i i'm
[54:49] sorry i'm going to just talk out loud
[54:51] for a few moments
[54:52] if you could just think of the battle
[54:54] that god chose
[54:56] it would be the battle to which that was
[54:59] mentioned in the cave
[55:02] it would be a battle to where that is it
[55:04] causes incredible devastations to homes
[55:07] and families and to physical
[55:09] characteristics
[55:11] god would not
[55:13] the battle would not be great missions
[55:15] trusted with great missions or great
[55:18] camp meetings but it would be a private
[55:21] battle
[55:24] so if we're going to fight this battle
[55:26] and jesus is with us
[55:28] may we inspire
[55:32] may we speak confidence and courage to
[55:35] the people that suffer this battle
[55:38] may they know that jesus is a healer
[55:41] every day
[55:47] now there's no way that you could
[55:49] understand what i'm saying right there
[55:50] unless you fought it
[55:53] there's no way because no man knows
[55:56] another man's battle
[55:58] until you begin to do it
[56:00] nobody knows what chemo does to you
[56:02] until you've actually had to fight it
[56:05] nobody knows what the times of doctors
[56:08] and all of those kinds of things is
[56:09] until you have to go through it
[56:12] you search for inspiration you search
[56:14] for every scripture you search for every
[56:16] quote that will give you strength for
[56:19] your daily battle it causes you to pray
[56:22] more than you've ever prayed
[56:24] you realize that every day could be your
[56:26] last day
[56:28] you realize
[56:29] with god all things are possible
[56:32] we can have visions to where that we see
[56:35] yourself well but between hearing the
[56:38] visions a journey that you got to battle
[56:40] through
[56:44] i just want to drop something to you
[56:46] here just for a moment
[56:48] there's a man named jimmy valvano
[56:50] henry's ever heard that name
[56:52] jimmy valvano was north carolina state
[56:55] head coach
[56:56] in the 80s
[56:58] he became popular
[57:00] and he was struck with cancer
[57:03] and he's actually the espn does a espy's
[57:06] award
[57:07] and uh
[57:09] they
[57:10] jimmy valvano as he had tumors all over
[57:12] him and he gave a speech that speech
[57:15] lasted 11 minutes and 19 seconds
[57:18] yes i've watched it a few times
[57:22] it was given on march the 3rd of 1993
[57:26] all of the people of
[57:28] of the community of the sports world the
[57:31] celebrities were there
[57:33] and they brought him up and he quickly
[57:35] tells them that i'm going to be the
[57:36] longest speech of the
[57:38] day and he begins to share a couple
[57:41] things and i want to i want to just
[57:42] share some things with you he says
[57:44] he said there's three things that you've
[57:46] got to do every day laugh
[57:49] think
[57:50] and cry
[57:51] he says if you do those three things
[57:53] every day you've had a full day
[57:56] it's important that you remember where
[57:58] you started at
[58:00] and where you are and where you're going
[58:11] he had a role model named lombardi
[58:15] and he tried to emulate that
[58:18] and so
[58:19] from that i'm going to take a sermon i
[58:21] have a role model
[58:25] and i have a champion
[58:28] he said
[58:30] there's three things that you've got to
[58:32] keep in your life and that's your family
[58:35] your religion
[58:38] and what you really care about in life
[58:44] he said you've got to enjoy every
[58:45] precious moment
[58:48] and you got to keep dreams alive
[58:51] i'm sharing this with you i know it has
[58:53] no spiritual value to you but for those
[58:55] that are fighting it may it encourage
[58:57] them
[58:59] give hope to others
[59:02] he ends the speech on don't give up
[59:06] don't ever give up
[59:08] don't give up don't ever give up
[59:11] this would be his last speech
[59:14] that he want
[59:16] but something that caught my attention
[59:18] in it
[59:20] the reason that i started here i
[59:22] actually told andrew and william before
[59:24] service i said don't think that i'm
[59:26] off course but
[59:28] but i'm going to just deliver this
[59:30] this morning i want to take a part of
[59:32] jimmy valvano speech and i just want to
[59:34] share it with you and i did
[59:37] but in the middle of being being it was
[59:39] a television production they had a guy
[59:41] back there
[59:42] that was flashing a screen 30 more
[59:44] seconds 30 more seconds and they were
[59:47] trying to get him to stop
[59:50] and he just stops and he laughs at that
[59:52] guy
[59:54] yeah
[59:56] he said you're trying to get me to stop
[59:58] give me 30 more seconds he said i've
[1:00:01] only got a few more minutes in my life
[1:00:03] anyway do you really think i'm going to
[1:00:05] pay attention to your sign 30 more
[1:00:07] seconds
[1:00:22] i wonder sometimes when we come to
[1:00:24] church do we really take it
[1:00:28] as much as we appreciate
[1:00:32] thousands of people sat and listened to
[1:00:34] probably one of the greatest speeches
[1:00:36] ever given by a man that was eat up with
[1:00:38] cancer
[1:00:39] and they actually almost had to carry
[1:00:41] him to the stage
[1:00:43] and he delivers his speech
[1:00:47] and they're wanting him to hurry up
[1:00:51] so i'm going to preach
[1:00:56] there are celebrities in hell
[1:01:00] that would love to hear the sermon that
[1:01:02] i'm about to deliver today
[1:01:04] [Applause]
[1:01:06] and if they could be able to step from
[1:01:08] that dimension and step to this
[1:01:09] dimension
[1:01:12] they would love to have the next hour
[1:01:16] to change the history of their life
[1:01:19] because their life has been written
[1:01:22] and it has a finality to it but if they
[1:01:25] could come and sit in a church like this
[1:01:28] service
[1:01:31] and instead of being known as jezebel
[1:01:37] instead of being known as elvis presley
[1:01:40] instead of being known as marilyn monroe
[1:01:44] instead of being known as herodias
[1:01:48] instead of being known as a trader
[1:01:51] and jambress
[1:01:53] instead of being known as as someone
[1:01:56] like demas that paul would write about
[1:01:59] demas has forsaken me
[1:02:07] if they could breathe life again
[1:02:11] and step back into a body
[1:02:14] even that they send in
[1:02:17] and be able to have the opportunity
[1:02:20] they would give it all
[1:02:22] and i'm saying give it all
[1:02:25] now let me just say alexander the great
[1:02:27] can't come
[1:02:28] herod can't come pilate can't come
[1:02:33] the greatest presidents that's ever
[1:02:35] lived would love to set where you're
[1:02:37] sitting at now
[1:02:41] brother branham said even jacqueline
[1:02:43] kennedy she never got to come and hear
[1:02:45] what you sisters have got to hear
[1:02:48] but if she heard she might have given
[1:02:51] her heart to the lord
[1:02:53] knowing that she was a woman of wealth
[1:02:55] and a woman of dignity way before john f
[1:02:58] kennedy it was an arranged marriage
[1:03:01] you know that i'm not telling you
[1:03:03] anything
[1:03:04] but she never heard the prophet's voice
[1:03:08] but let me just say this you there are
[1:03:10] people that hurt at one time
[1:03:12] and it anchored their life forever
[1:03:17] it anchored it forever
[1:03:20] men that just sit and listen and sitting
[1:03:22] with their friends
[1:03:23] they sit and listen to the word as
[1:03:26] brother branham was preaching in the
[1:03:27] live meeting and they said that's a
[1:03:29] prophet
[1:03:31] others made fun and and walked out of it
[1:03:35] brother biscuit said one of his dearest
[1:03:37] friends was sitting beside of him in
[1:03:38] church and he went a complete different
[1:03:41] way
[1:03:43] brother
[1:03:44] jonah empty's father
[1:03:46] said in a meeting
[1:03:49] and didn't know it was his first live
[1:03:53] ministry meeting that he'd ever been in
[1:03:55] didn't know anything hardly about church
[1:03:57] only thing he knew was his girlfriend
[1:03:59] was a real christian and she invited him
[1:04:02] to the meeting and he hears brother
[1:04:04] branham for the first time and he said
[1:04:06] that man's a prophet
[1:04:08] so you don't have to argue for years to
[1:04:11] figure out if he's a prophet or not
[1:04:25] lives go so quickly
[1:04:28] the rich young ruler would like to have
[1:04:30] your place today
[1:04:34] pilate would like to wash the hands of
[1:04:36] jesus christ off of him
[1:04:39] branham mentions an incredible story
[1:04:42] about a man that was
[1:04:44] in shreveport
[1:04:46] he said there is no such thing as god
[1:04:49] he blasphemed
[1:04:52] he said they're nothing but a bunch of
[1:04:53] holy rollers
[1:04:55] and lightning
[1:04:57] killed that man
[1:04:59] and they took him to the grave and when
[1:05:01] they was burying that man
[1:05:04] there come up a little bitty cloud and
[1:05:06] lightning struck the casket
[1:05:10] and blowed that man plum out of the
[1:05:12] casket
[1:05:15] he makes a statement he said jehovah god
[1:05:18] gets angry
[1:05:20] i know he's a good god but he's a he's a
[1:05:22] god of judgment too
[1:05:24] he still looks he knows
[1:05:28] brother madam immediately just before
[1:05:30] that he tells of another story of a girl
[1:05:33] that was in and out of church and in and
[1:05:35] out of church
[1:05:36] and she knowed what was right but she
[1:05:38] she refused to do right she was a a
[1:05:40] smoker and she refused to do right and
[1:05:43] he said lightning struck her
[1:05:50] charles spurgeon was walking with a
[1:05:52] childhood friend
[1:05:54] in his teenage years
[1:05:56] and lightning struck his friend walking
[1:05:58] down the street with him
[1:06:00] charles spurgeon dedicated the rest of
[1:06:02] his life
[1:06:05] to jesus christ
[1:06:07] because that same lightning strike could
[1:06:09] have took him
[1:06:13] let me just say this to you it may have
[1:06:15] not been lightning come in your life i
[1:06:17] was struck by light and it hit the tree
[1:06:19] and hit me and knocked the end off my
[1:06:21] weed eater
[1:06:25] let me just say this to you didn't see
[1:06:26] it coming didn't know it was going to
[1:06:28] happen
[1:06:29] but i'm thankful to be standing here
[1:06:31] today
[1:06:34] brother bam turns after he says that he
[1:06:36] says if you're without god raise your
[1:06:38] hand

[1:07:15] and believeth on him that sent me has
[1:07:17] everlasting life and shall not come into
[1:07:21] condemnation but has passed from death
[1:07:23] and to life what a wonderful thing to
[1:07:26] think if sincere hearts behind those
[1:07:29] hands
[1:07:30] really meant that
[1:07:34] something just happened now you said
[1:07:37] he that that will confess me before men
[1:07:40] will i confess them before my father and
[1:07:43] his holy angels let them know that thou
[1:07:46] art here lord i pray that you will grant
[1:07:50] it hear us we are your servants lord in
[1:07:54] jesus name
[1:08:02] i want to just capture the moment that
[1:08:04] you're sitting in just now
[1:08:07] i don't know where you're at maybe
[1:08:08] people that are watching by way of by
[1:08:10] the internet maybe they haven't given
[1:08:13] their heart to god
[1:08:15] and maybe their life is now telling a
[1:08:17] story that they wouldn't even want their
[1:08:18] mother and father to know
[1:08:22] many times people hide sicker things in
[1:08:24] their life you heard me preach on naaman
[1:08:27] the other day living a secret life
[1:08:29] let me just say sin will take you
[1:08:31] further than you ever thought you'd go
[1:08:35] you make a step towards sin he will
[1:08:38] destroy your life
[1:08:40] satan has nobody to negotiate with he
[1:08:43] destroys families he destroys homes he
[1:08:46] destroys flesh
[1:08:49] [Applause]
[1:08:51] prison sets full of people that made one
[1:08:55] horrible error in their life
[1:08:58] they were good people
[1:09:01] moral people but temper got a hold of
[1:09:04] them or jealousy got a hold of them and
[1:09:07] one day changed their life
[1:09:10] can i say one day can change a
[1:09:12] christian's life
[1:09:14] you once were a lot of bad things in
[1:09:16] your life but one day
[1:09:19] when jesus speaks and drives a hole to
[1:09:21] your life
[1:09:23] never to be the same ever again
[1:09:26] [Applause]
[1:09:43] i have a lot of friends that are
[1:09:46] great preachers
[1:09:48] because we are in the golden age and the
[1:09:51] opening of the word
[1:09:53] god has given us the greatest message
[1:09:55] that you could be given
[1:09:58] there's a lot of men that preach the
[1:09:59] gospel that don't live it
[1:10:02] but i am i am thrilled to be a part
[1:10:07] of a select group of men
[1:10:10] i have zero confidence in a man that
[1:10:12] can't live it
[1:10:17] i have zero confidence
[1:10:19] but i stand shoulder to shoulder
[1:10:21] sometimes my shoulders much shorter than
[1:10:23] the other shoulders but i stand shoulder
[1:10:25] to shoulder to the men
[1:10:27] that carry the message of the hour and
[1:10:30] they have a desire to keep it pure and
[1:10:32] to keep it holy
[1:10:34] to stand and preach the breath of god to
[1:10:37] an audience
[1:10:39] whether it's 10 people or thousands of
[1:10:41] people and they stand and they give
[1:10:44] their life yes
[1:10:48] and literally they become
[1:10:50] a
[1:10:52] instrument
[1:10:54] through which god can breathe through
[1:11:00] and from their life
[1:11:02] god breathes through them
[1:11:05] and and and it is more than just a
[1:11:08] reproduction
[1:11:09] of inspiration of
[1:11:11] man or personality
[1:11:14] but jesus christ wants us so in
[1:11:17] tabernacle and individual
[1:11:20] until when he preaches there becomes a
[1:11:23] thirst for that same life lived on the
[1:11:26] inside
[1:11:28] you don't want my personality lived on
[1:11:30] the inside of you you want the life of
[1:11:32] jesus christ lived on the inside of you
[1:11:37] are you with me if you get my
[1:11:38] personality you'll get my failures
[1:11:43] so never elevate a man into lordship or
[1:11:47] kingship
[1:11:50] but we are deeply respectful to the
[1:11:53] great men of god
[1:11:55] but none of them
[1:11:58] could pay for their own sins
[1:12:02] even our prophet couldn't pay for his
[1:12:04] own sins
[1:12:07] he needed a champion
[1:12:11] he needed an intercessor
[1:12:14] he needed a great king himself
[1:12:17] so god left the portals of glory
[1:12:21] and let me just say this to you this man
[1:12:27] there will never be enough books written
[1:12:29] about him
[1:12:30] there will never be enough stories red
[1:12:33] earth even reproduced about him
[1:12:38] this man is jesus
[1:12:42] you've heard me read it before i want to
[1:12:44] read it to you again
[1:12:46] when i fall he lifts me up
[1:12:50] when i fail he forgives me
[1:12:53] when i am weak
[1:12:56] he is strong
[1:12:58] when i am lost he is the way
[1:13:02] when i am afraid he is my courage
[1:13:06] when i'm stumble he steadies me
[1:13:09] when i am hurt he leads me
[1:13:15] when i am broken he mends me
[1:13:18] when i am blind he leads me
[1:13:22] when i am hungry he feeds me
[1:13:25] when i face trials he is with me
[1:13:28] when i face persecution he shields me
[1:13:31] when i face problems he comforts me
[1:13:33] when i face loss he provides for me
[1:13:36] when i face death he carries me home
[1:13:40] this friend goes further
[1:13:46] than any other man can go
[1:13:49] he is god
[1:13:52] he is faithful
[1:13:54] and i am his
[1:13:57] and he is mine
[1:14:02] god is in control
[1:14:04] i am on this that's his side
[1:14:07] and that means that all is well
[1:14:10] with my soul
[1:14:14] doctor's reports tell me a lot of
[1:14:15] different things
[1:14:17] but i've got another report
[1:14:20] who hath believed i report into whom is
[1:14:22] the arm of the lord revealed isaiah 53
[1:14:25] and 1 he says for he shall grow up
[1:14:27] before him as a tender plant
[1:14:29] as a root out of dry ground he hath no
[1:14:31] formula calmness and when we shall see
[1:14:33] him there is no beauty that we should
[1:14:35] desire him
[1:14:36] he is despised and rejected of men a man
[1:14:39] of sorrows acquainted with grief
[1:14:43] and we hear to say if our faces from him
[1:14:45] and he is despised and we esteemed him
[1:14:47] not surely he has borne our griefs
[1:14:53] are you
[1:14:54] awake carried our sorrows
[1:14:59] yet we did esteem him stricken and
[1:15:01] smitten of god and afflicted but he was
[1:15:04] wounded for our transgressions
[1:15:06] he was bruised for our iniquities the
[1:15:09] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[1:15:12] and with his stripes
[1:15:16] we
[1:15:17] are healed
[1:15:28] the lord is my shepherd and i shall not
[1:15:30] want
[1:15:31] he maketh me to lie down in green
[1:15:33] pastures and he leadeth me beside of the
[1:15:35] still waters
[1:15:37] he restoreth my soul and he leadeth me
[1:15:39] in the past of righteousness for his
[1:15:40] name's sake and yea though i walk
[1:15:42] through the valley of death
[1:15:45] i'm living that
[1:15:47] yea though i walk through the valley of
[1:15:48] the shadow of death i will fear no evil
[1:15:53] for thou art with me thy rod and thy
[1:15:55] staff they comfort me thou preparest the
[1:15:57] table before me in the presence of my
[1:15:59] enemies
[1:16:04] thou anointest my head with all right
[1:16:07] my cup runneth over
[1:16:09] surely goodness and mercy shall follow
[1:16:11] me all the days of my life and i will
[1:16:13] dwell in the house of the lord forever
[1:16:21] psalms 24 and verse 7
[1:16:23] lift up your heads on your gates
[1:16:27] and be you lifted up you everlasting
[1:16:29] doors for the kingdom of glory shall
[1:16:30] come in
[1:16:32] who is the king of glory the lord strong
[1:16:35] and mighty the lord mighty in battle

[1:16:41] even lift them up ye everlasting doors
[1:16:43] and the king of glory shall come in who
[1:16:46] is the king of glory israel don't know
[1:16:49] it yet but we
[1:16:51] have him as our king
[1:16:56] are you with me now this world's had a
[1:16:58] lot of kings and a lot of presidents and
[1:17:01] a lot of dictators
[1:17:02] but there's never been a king like king
[1:17:04] jesus
[1:17:05] [Applause]
[1:17:13] what makes it so incredible we are his
[1:17:16] queen
[1:17:18] he just wasn't thinking about himself
[1:17:20] but he was thinking about you
[1:17:23] when he slept the wedding ban a
[1:17:25] predestination on you before the
[1:17:27] foundation of the world he didn't get
[1:17:31] you just to lose you
[1:17:34] [Applause]
[1:17:36] god's the kind of businessman that don't
[1:17:38] quit
[1:17:39] he don't turn around and go away
[1:17:42] if he ever follow you he'll never unseat
[1:17:46] you
[1:17:47] [Applause]
[1:17:59] the other day i was getting ready to
[1:18:00] have a very difficult day i didn't
[1:18:08] i'm gonna tell this backwards
[1:18:14] but i was getting ready to have a very
[1:18:15] difficult day
[1:18:21] sometimes you don't know how difficult
[1:18:22] day
[1:18:26] because the cancer started in my eye
[1:18:28] that's where they look and they're on
[1:18:30] all kinds of scans
[1:18:31] and then they run
[1:18:33] they run laser they run a real high beam
[1:18:35] lights
[1:18:37] to look at the back end of my eye
[1:18:40] i'll just tell you how it is there's
[1:18:42] eight spots on the back of my eye
[1:18:46] and and they're constantly watching
[1:18:48] those eight spots are they growing
[1:18:51] are they multiplying
[1:18:54] and to be honest with you there are some
[1:18:56] tests that are more than you can take
[1:18:59] and they put my head in a machine and
[1:19:01] they hold my head they kind of hold it
[1:19:04] and i was like a bull in a i was like a
[1:19:06] bull in it the other day and
[1:19:08] it was more than i could take and i
[1:19:10] backed my head out of there and the
[1:19:11] doctor said put that head back in there
[1:19:13] and i said
[1:19:14] it's more than i can take
[1:19:15] i'm sorry i i just can't take any more
[1:19:18] of this
[1:19:19] he said put that head back in there
[1:19:23] i put my head back in and repeated it
[1:19:25] and repeated it and for about the next
[1:19:26] 20 minutes they they look with that
[1:19:28] intense light into my eye
[1:19:31] i cried like a baby i'll just have to be
[1:19:33] honest with you i cried like a baby
[1:19:35] sister connie was in the car because i
[1:19:36] couldn't get in
[1:19:38] and so
[1:19:39] i cried like the baby i texted her i i
[1:19:41] told i called her i said i'm on my way
[1:19:44] and i said i'm just i'm just feeling and
[1:19:46] i literally felt my way down the wall
[1:19:48] and i got to the elevator i got in the
[1:19:50] elevator
[1:19:52] and i
[1:19:53] actually pushed three buttons and i got
[1:19:54] off at the one that i thought it should
[1:19:56] get off of it so happened it was right
[1:20:00] and i made my way out came out into the
[1:20:02] sunlight and i was just bawling i
[1:20:05] literally got in the van and i was just
[1:20:07] bawling i was bawling
[1:20:10] he told me some difficult news and
[1:20:13] then i would i would go to another
[1:20:15] doctor
[1:20:16] and
[1:20:17] and she would talk to me a bit and some
[1:20:19] changing things that's getting ready to
[1:20:20] happen
[1:20:23] you know that's a doctor's report that's
[1:20:25] the way they look at things
[1:20:28] but at 4 30 in the morning
[1:20:31] not gonna be much longer but i'm hot
[1:20:35] but at 4 30 in the morning i i got up
[1:20:38] out of bed and i was awake as i am right
[1:20:40] now
[1:20:42] i'm starting to get a little age on me
[1:20:43] so i go to bed early
[1:20:46] and so if you call if you call me after
[1:20:48] nine o'clock you'll get my answering
[1:20:50] machine
[1:20:52] i'm not gonna apologize for that
[1:20:55] and so
[1:20:57] you know i just simply turn it off and
[1:20:59] and i go to bed
[1:21:02] and so at 4 30 the other morning i i
[1:21:04] climbed out of i climbed out of bed and
[1:21:07] i was just standing there
[1:21:10] and all of a sudden i see a vision
[1:21:13] and i was standing in a white shirt and
[1:21:15] black pants
[1:21:17] that's interesting
[1:21:21] and andrew was standing in a white shirt
[1:21:23] black pants
[1:21:25] we didn't have her ties on
[1:21:28] and wayne lawson was standing in a white
[1:21:30] shirt and black pants
[1:21:33] we were together and
[1:21:36] and i had wavy hair
[1:21:40] sister heather knows
[1:21:42] a little picky with my hair
[1:21:47] and chemo's made it real kinky
[1:21:50] so when i saw the vision that i had
[1:21:52] longer
[1:21:53] wavy hair
[1:21:56] really made me feel good
[1:21:59] but it was still gray
[1:22:03] and so we were at a
[1:22:06] we were at a coffee shop that had
[1:22:07] pastries
[1:22:19] and i looked over and there was a honey
[1:22:20] bun there
[1:22:23] that the syrup was just running off of
[1:22:26] listen
[1:22:27] i'm a honey bun
[1:22:29] aficionado if you could if that's a word
[1:22:34] i know in one bite if that baby's good
[1:22:37] or not
[1:22:38] that's all it takes one bite
[1:22:40] and if it's good i'll eat the rest of it
[1:22:42] if it's not it goes in trash bin 101.
[1:22:46] now
[1:22:47] it ain't worth the calories that got to
[1:22:49] go in that baby
[1:22:53] and i told the lady behind the counter i
[1:22:55] said
[1:22:56] i'll have that honey bun and brother
[1:22:58] wayne was standing beside of me and he
[1:23:00] says brother ron he said
[1:23:03] are you sure you can have that and i
[1:23:05] turned to brother wayne in the vision i
[1:23:07] said oh
[1:23:08] i don't have cancer no more
[1:23:11] [Applause]
[1:23:40] hallelujah
[1:23:45] and we might as well get two devils at
[1:23:47] the same time
[1:23:48] if i could have that honey bun that
[1:23:50] means i don't have sugar diabetes no
[1:23:51] more
[1:24:08] so let me just say this to you god gave
[1:24:10] me a vision
[1:24:12] knowing what the day was going to hold
[1:24:13] how difficult it was going to be so he
[1:24:16] gave me his report first
[1:24:32] and thursday was a wicked day after
[1:24:34] wednesday
[1:24:36] but i keep going back to he showed me
[1:24:38] time and time again brother branham
[1:24:40] patting me on the cheek you're going to
[1:24:41] be well ron
[1:24:43] and god has reminded us in of his
[1:24:45] promises in the word over 3 000 promises
[1:24:49] in this word
[1:24:51] and he's never failed on any of them
[1:25:03] now i want to say this to you this
[1:25:05] morning

[1:25:24] chapter there may be some difficult
[1:25:27] roads if you've got to go through but

[1:25:34] god's watched over you and grace rewrote
[1:25:38] your book
[1:25:42] hallelujah
[1:25:50] he rewrote it
[1:25:59] what was my king doing when he was
[1:26:01] carrying that cross
[1:26:05] he was paying for my redemption
[1:26:09] what was he doing when he was being
[1:26:11] beaten like any other unlike any other
[1:26:14] human being that's ever been beaten
[1:26:17] he was paying for my healing
[1:26:32] thank
[1:26:34] you so what you do is you take his word
[1:26:40] you don't take your feelings
[1:26:42] you don't take your emotions
[1:26:44] you take his word
[1:26:46] and you take his promises
[1:26:48] and you confess his promises
[1:26:51] and they're everyone true
[1:26:54] and you don't mix emotions in with it
[1:26:56] you take his promises to defeat the
[1:26:59] devil
[1:27:01] because like my battle it's an unseen
[1:27:04] battle
[1:27:06] it's a it's a it's a you don't do it
[1:27:08] with flesh and blood affair you do it
[1:27:11] because it's a spiritual warfare

[1:28:32] i'm sorry i can't travel a lot of places
[1:28:36] and preach the word
[1:28:40] but i value the moment that i stand here
[1:28:42] and preach to you
[1:28:45] what i spoke and what will you be
[1:28:47] remembered for six years ago
[1:28:50] and sister cassidy would write a song
[1:28:52] about it brother biscuit at the end of
[1:28:54] this service
[1:28:55] would recognize more than a man was
[1:28:57] preaching
[1:28:58] and a phenomenal miracle happened
[1:29:01] there with brother biskell and his
[1:29:02] family
[1:29:10] i've related to you about jimmy valvano
[1:29:12] and the people that said in the audience
[1:29:14] didn't appreciate what was going on
[1:29:17] maybe the people in hell would love to
[1:29:19] have your seat this morning
[1:29:23] i related that to you
[1:29:26] we could talk about rich young ruler
[1:29:28] that missed his opportunity
[1:29:30] or demas walking away
[1:29:45] there was a young girl that said in
[1:29:47] brother branham's meeting
[1:29:59] and
[1:30:01] she raised up and
[1:30:03] became a sunday school teacher
[1:30:09] and she got to running around on her
[1:30:10] husband
[1:30:14] well she left church
[1:30:18] brother brown said she grieved her soul
[1:30:19] away from her
[1:30:22] so she could just do anything she wanted
[1:30:24] to do
[1:30:30] so she went to another church
[1:30:33] she became a sunday school teacher there
[1:30:38] and she ran off with another man
[1:30:43] and it repeated itself over and over and
[1:30:45] over again
[1:30:48] brother man would use this and i'm just
[1:30:50] going to just bring some story to a
[1:30:52] couple different things to you he said
[1:30:55] you you go away
[1:30:57] and he said your soul you grieve it away
[1:31:00] and then you do what you want to do but
[1:31:02] once in a while your soul will come back
[1:31:04] to you
[1:31:05] and it'll haunt you
[1:31:07] he said brother on i don't live i don't
[1:31:09] believe in ghosts
[1:31:11] they're real
[1:31:15] it's like a man dying that don't have
[1:31:17] jesus
[1:31:18] his soul wanders
[1:31:21] his soul wonders
[1:31:23] and and it'll and it can't find peace
[1:31:27] so his soul wonders
[1:31:29] not everybody's going to heaven folks
[1:31:30] let me just drop it to you not
[1:31:32] everybody's going
[1:31:34] and this girl had came to the spot to
[1:31:36] where she grieved her soul away and now
[1:31:38] she's coming to die brother ram lived
[1:31:40] long enough to watch this phase take
[1:31:42] place and now she's coming to die
[1:31:45] and she's dying such a vicious death
[1:31:47] until the freckles became out like huge
[1:31:50] moles on her face
[1:31:52] and she's screaming and her preacher is
[1:31:55] trying to tell her you're okay you're

[1:32:06] and her preacher couldn't bring her
[1:32:08] satisfaction
[1:32:09] he was telling her she was all right she
[1:32:11] knowed better
[1:32:14] elvis presley had three different
[1:32:16] preachers to come to him
[1:32:18] one was dottie rambo
[1:32:21] and and came to him and and he tried to
[1:32:24] get right with god and he told each of
[1:32:26] them the same thing i have sow my soul
[1:32:33] this was his confession i sow my soul
[1:32:36] fleets of cadillac's popularity women
[1:32:40] let me say in the face of eternal life
[1:32:44] that's not a good bargain

[1:32:54] in her life and now she's come to die
[1:32:58] and the doctors are giving her one hypo
[1:33:01] after another that's what brother brown
[1:33:02] called it hypo
[1:33:04] try to numb her conscience
[1:33:06] and he's given her one after another
[1:33:09] and brother branham was making his way
[1:33:12] but he didn't get there in time
[1:33:14] and they told him said brother bram
[1:33:16] she
[1:33:16] has been calling for you
[1:33:19] and brother branham said her soul came
[1:33:22] back
[1:33:27] to grievor
[1:33:33] the first woman doctor that performed
[1:33:35] abortions
[1:33:38] when she came to die
[1:33:42] she began to scream at all of those

[1:41:10] i love biographies
[1:41:17] when you think about
[1:41:19] people's lives they lift it
[1:41:22] and then it's placed in a book
[1:41:24] whether it's spurgeon
[1:41:27] or feeny or one of my favorites robert
[1:41:29] sheffy
[1:41:32] and it's placed in a book
[1:41:34] and they lived that life 80 years
[1:41:39] and you go through the book
[1:41:42] and you and you look at it
[1:41:45] and you think about
[1:41:46] what if they wrote a book about you
[1:41:50] what if in turn somebody thought enough
[1:41:52] of you
[1:41:54] to write a book
[1:41:57] i don't know if you'll do that about
[1:41:58] your father
[1:42:01] translator
[1:42:04] i don't know if there'd be a time

[1:42:11] but what about your book
[1:42:13] here's where i want to come to
[1:42:15] what about your book
[1:42:20] what would it say
[1:42:23] what would somebody else say
[1:42:26] about your life
[1:42:29] not what you say amen
[1:42:32] because i got news for you if you die
[1:42:34] you say ain't got nothing to do with it
[1:42:40] ain't got anything to do with it
[1:42:42] it's already been said
[1:42:47] what would they say about your life
[1:42:52] let's stand
[1:43:08] hello
[1:43:13] i like it when you come to church and
[1:43:14] you feel like you've been on a journey
[1:43:17] kind of feels that way you just kind of
[1:43:19] went on a journey today
[1:43:24] jesus would leave it up to his disciples
[1:43:27] to write his story
[1:43:33] he wouldn't have time to write it
[1:43:35] he would leave it up to his disciples
[1:43:38] and they wrote it
[1:43:39] and all agreed that he walked on water
[1:43:43] they saw it happen
[1:43:45] they wrote it that he turned water into
[1:43:48] wine
[1:43:50] not just a cup
[1:43:53] but in one place it says 62 gallons
[1:43:56] of water turned into wine
[1:43:59] which was the best wine in the world
[1:44:02] which one writer says was worth millions
[1:44:05] of dollars so he not only
[1:44:08] for the evening turned the water into
[1:44:10] wine for them
[1:44:11] he also gave them a lifelong legacy
[1:44:15] of wine
[1:44:18] now what he does for you was when he
[1:44:19] pours his wine or the holy ghost on the
[1:44:21] inside of you he gives you a lifelong
[1:44:24] journey
[1:44:25] not just enough to tickle you for the
[1:44:27] afternoon
[1:44:31] not enough just to make you happy for
[1:44:33] this evening or this morning
[1:44:35] but he gives it to you for the rest of
[1:44:37] your life
[1:44:40] ain't that wonderful
[1:44:42] hallelujah
[1:44:44] hallelujah that's about it

[1:45:30] hands this morning that just needs a
