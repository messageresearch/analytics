[43:48] heart I suppose he took his gift to of
[43:51] her he found her in a land not here he
[43:55] he he took the gift it was an
[43:56] appropriate gift amen God merciful yet
[44:01] it cost him his death there's no other
[44:03] way in the world he could have give her
[44:04] the gift she was buing amen but the only
[44:07] way he could do it would be go like that
[44:14] amen little doll didn't mean too much I
[44:19] guess a little dirty face doll but it
[44:22] what did he do it it fulfilled a promise
[44:24] he had made amen no wonder what the
[44:27] people thought about it his dirty hands
[44:29] and a little dirty dog but it fulfilled
[44:31] a promise to his little
[44:33] girl sometimes they look upon the gospel
[44:37] the same thing they didn't want it when
[44:39] God brought it but it fulfilled a
[44:41] promise amen that he would give his
[44:45] son you know what they left him to die
[44:48] too just like a on the street
[44:51] exactly right they left him to die like
[44:53] a on the street and today they
[44:55] they treat him like a trap on the street
[44:59] amen amen but he fulfilled what he was
[45:03] supposed to do he was the gift that God
[45:04] promised to the world tonight let me
[45:08] take him as my Sav to my heart let me
[45:11] walk into the face of my death or
[45:13] whatever it is like amen I promise my
[45:16] life to him I want to take it to him no
[45:19] matter why I have to go if I have go
[45:20] through death and I have to be shot no
[45:22] matter what takes place I have to be
[45:23] laughed at call crazy everything got
[45:26] communicate the rest of the Christian
[45:28] churches and so forth uh it's the gift
[45:30] of God that I hold in my heart he I want
[45:33] to take it to him that's
[45:37] just appropriate gifts I speak
[45:41] on it was appropriate gift because the
[45:44] little girl she was a little girl to be
[45:47] her mother would have been an
[45:49] appropriate gift was a little doll an
[45:51] appropriate gift that God the Creator
[45:53] could give to his creation would be a
[45:55] Sav just save it from the condition it
[45:57] was in I wonder tonight as we are
[46:01] approaching Christmas now and I suppose
[46:03] it be the last message we hear between
[46:05] now and Christmas Les we get the radio
[46:07] messages
[46:09] somewhere I wonder
[46:11] tonight if we've accepted the gift that
[46:13] God promised us eternal life through
[46:16] Believing on Christ and receiving the
[46:18] Holy
[46:24] Spirit

[48:37] me when I was
[48:40] bound in
[48:42] Chains of
[48:44] [Music]
[48:47] s he came to
[48:52] me when I possessed last no
[48:58] hope with
[49:00] [Applause]
[49:03] him he picked me
[49:07] up and
[49:09] Drew Me
[49:11] Gently
[49:13] to his
[49:19] side where
[49:22] today in his we love and
[49:28] now AB
[49:33] about he came to
[49:40] me he
[49:43] came to
[49:49] me when I could not
[49:53] come to where where he
[49:57] was he came to
[50:01] [Music]

[50:32] [Music]
[50:54] me
[50:57] [Applause]
[51:07] [Music]
[51:09] aren't you thankful aren't you thankful
[51:12] that he came to
[51:13] you 2,000 years ago in times very much
[51:18] like these the busyness of Life had
[51:21] crept in on the city of Bethlehem
[51:23] streets were filled with people
[51:26] Downing the government ridiculing the
[51:29] new tax laws concerned about the impact
[51:32] of current and present state affairs but
[51:35] the world did not realize how great a
[51:38] gift was truly coming that it would be
[51:41] these little feet in a Manger who would
[51:43] tread upon the Serpent's neck and he
[51:46] would crush his feet crush his head it
[51:49] was searched out by those that were in
[51:51] need but none could find place for this
[51:54] gift
[51:56] it wasn't that the gift that was coming
[51:58] was too big in size that it couldn't be
[52:00] accepted but that men were refusing to
[52:03] house the greatest present unwrapping
[52:06] that would ever take place in humanity
[52:09] there was no room then and I hate to say
[52:12] it there's very little room for him now
[52:16] you see God can use every faculty of our
[52:19] being if it's committed and surrendered
[52:21] to him he can use our mind our dreams
[52:24] our subconscious our first conscious our
[52:26] tongue our songs our eyes everything
[52:29] that we have can be used of God if it's
[52:33] committed to God you see everything that
[52:36] you are committed to God he'll use every
[52:39] outlet and every part of you he'll use
[52:41] it no matter what it is he'll use it if
[52:44] it's Sanctified to his purpose and his
[52:48] calling you see when Jesus was a child
[52:52] of around 2 years old there were wise
[52:54] men that came and they'd found the holy
[52:58] child that they had been in search for
[53:00] ever since that the star appeared and
[53:03] when they got to a great big city of
[53:05] Jerusalem and they got on the outside of
[53:08] that City and the star appeared again
[53:11] the Bible records that they rejoiced
[53:14] with exceeding great
[53:16] joy because they had found the star that
[53:18] would lead them to the Christ child they
[53:21] brought him gold they brought him
[53:24] frankincense
[53:25] and they brought him mer and how fitting
[53:28] it is that Christ would receive such
[53:30] gifts as these because gold speaks of
[53:33] deity and God is deity frankincense it
[53:37] speaks of service and myrr it speaks of
[53:41] death and that's what he was you see it
[53:44] was God deity and service to die for all
[53:48] of
[53:49] humanity that's what he was the very
[53:51] thing that they brought identified what
[53:54] they thought he was and today the things
[53:58] that we bring to him identifies what our
[54:01] thoughts is about him it identifies what
[54:05] our thoughts is about him you understand
[54:07] what I mean tonight that if you believe
[54:10] it with all of your heart every word
[54:12] that you identified by giving all that
[54:16] you have but if you believe it's a good
[54:18] place to associate with better people
[54:20] around church and things like that and
[54:23] just about what you give and just a few
[54:25] social hours of uh of with some of the
[54:28] congregation or something but if you
[54:30] really believe it with all your heart
[54:33] then you give everything that's in you
[54:34] to it and it identifies that you truly
[54:37] believe the message that you believe it
[54:40] to be the truth so I ask you tonight in
[54:44] this present world where gifts should be
[54:46] offered to a King what gifts do you give
[54:51] what do you freely give to this King how
[54:53] do you identify this King
[54:55] is he King is he Lord or is he a
[55:00] on the street to
[55:01] you he's not asking for much tonight all
[55:05] he's asking for is your heart because
[55:07] the Bible records to us that every man
[55:10] according as Heath purp it in his heart
[55:12] so let him give not grudgingly or of
[55:15] necessity for God loves a cheerful Giver
[55:20] the Bible also declares to us in John
[55:22] 3:16 for God so loved the world world
[55:25] that he gave he didn't give grudgingly
[55:29] he didn't give out of necessity but he
[55:32] gave his only begotten son that
[55:34] whosoever believeth on him should not
[55:36] perish but have everlasting life for God
[55:39] sent not his son into the world to
[55:41] condemn the world but that the world
[55:43] through him might be saved we thank the
[55:47] Lord for a savior that came 2,000 years
[55:50] ago tonight we wanted to present to you
[55:53] this this plate that God's gifts always
[55:58] find their
[55:59] places it was inspired because about 15
[56:02] years ago our pastor brother Ron Spencer
[56:04] that sits here he preached a sermon on
[56:07] Christmas morning from this very text
[56:10] John 3:16 and took the in the
[56:13] street and he preached it in such a way
[56:15] and had such an impact on us and with
[56:18] brother Ron's gift he had us all sitting
[56:20] on the edge of our seat waiting for the
[56:22] next word he had us as the train
[56:25] he had us laying there and when he
[56:27] rolled over we seen Christ laying
[56:31] there but four years
[56:34] ago four years ago yesterday the Lord
[56:37] spoke to our pastor and said if you'll
[56:40] trust me I'll use you like never before
[56:44] Full Gospel Lighthouse we've received a
[56:46] gift these past four years we've seen
[56:50] Christ come in a god-called man and tell
[56:53] us that the h won't stop the music
[56:57] amen he's told us that Satan has
[57:00] underestimated us that you can overcome
[57:03] in your night Seasons nonon it's time to
[57:06] go
[57:07] watch the strength of God is great
[57:10] enough for your needs and we stand as a
[57:13] declaration and that we are experiencing
[57:16] fulfillment brother Timothy he told you
[57:19] that you're in God's
[57:20] hands and one of my
[57:23] favorites these are all sermon titles
[57:26] that have brought to you in the last
[57:27] four years but this is one of my
[57:29] favorites that he has not sent me to
[57:32] this battle to
[57:35] lose and his latest of series every knee
[57:39] shall bow and every tongue shall confess
[57:42] that this is the greatest gift that ever
[57:44] has been and ever will be given amongst
[57:46] Humanity the promised gift the son of
[57:49] almighty God we've received a great gift
[57:52] here in these past four years
[57:56] the gave everything within him to
[57:58] get the doll to his little child but in
[58:01] his own Humanity he couldn't get it to
[58:04] her but in this life the greatest gift
[58:07] that ever was given he made a way that
[58:10] you wouldn't have to be without this
[58:11] gift but that Gift Giver would come and
[58:13] live on the inside of your heart and he
[58:15] would reign supreme if you would allow
[58:17] him to do so so in this Christmas season
[58:20] I believe that God God's gifts have
[58:23] found their place and young and old and
[58:26] the message is here and it's living out
[58:29] we see gold we see frankincense and we
[58:32] see M living right here in the body of
[58:36] Christ it's death to self for service
[58:40] for almighty God to live you see those
[58:43] wise men cross thousands of miles I'm
[58:46] sure they went through well I'm sure
[58:49] they went through all kinds of things
[58:51] that maybe we never heard of but no
[58:54] matter what they went went through they
[58:55] kept following the star these past four
[58:58] years have been a treasure to us that no
[59:00] matter what we go through we keep
[59:02] following the star when the journey got
[59:05] hot for the wise men they kept following
[59:07] the star this was not just some easy
[59:10] Journey for them they traveled for 2
[59:12] years trying to find this child no
[59:14] matter what desert they were going
[59:16] through they followed that star no
[59:18] matter what critics said they were
[59:21] trusting in the gift that God had
[59:23] allowed them with the ability that had
[59:26] passed over every observatory in the
[59:28] land they were trusting in the star that
[59:30] they were following and God has given to
[59:33] us in this generation a seven star that
[59:35] has led us to Christ the child not a
[59:37] child that is in a Manger of 2,000 years
[59:40] ago but a god that is ever presentent
[59:43] that he promised you that he'd never
[59:44] leave you and he'd never forsake you I'd
[59:46] say that Full Gospel Lighthouse has been
[59:49] blessed to say that God's Gift has found
[59:52] its place in our heart
[59:55] who knew that these three wise
[59:58] men could let trust lead them to the
[1:00:02] greatest gift and if you'll trust him
[1:00:05] he'll use you like never before if I
[1:00:09] could have the key ofc or key of G
[1:00:11] sister
[1:00:12] Cassie I wonder in this Christmas season
