and if that will help us get through some of this and not get some of you sick and maybe we should have did it this week but you know you never know and so after last night about half of us here i said we got to do something here so we'll delay it a week and if that'll be okay with you now you continue to pray and read your bible every day and so amen you know if a week knocks you out of not quit serving lord you didn't have nothing to start off with and so amen amen any good to us so good to see so many wonderful faces here today and we love you and with all of our hearts and and i'd like to just uh start this service out this morning by by announcing a text today uh first our first day of the year i'd like to speak to you on creating a legacy creating a legacy amen we got this yesterday and i thought it was incredible sometimes we feel like well everything is just blocking us and blocking us and blocking us and seems like nothing's going to get done i'd like to read you a page out of john wesley's diary many years ago i read john wesley's diary and i was amazed how many times john wesley the messenger of the age five foot one red-headed man was stoned and left for dead and later in the day he'd shake off the stones after everybody had quit throwing and went home and then went and preached the next day god put something on the inside of him greater than any man amen sunday morning the may 5th he preached at saint anne's and was asked to not come back anymore sunday may the fifth preached at saint john's and the deacon said get out stay out sunday may the 12th he preached at saint jude's can't go back there either sunday may the 19th the preached at saint somebody else's [Music] deacons called in special media and said i couldn't return sunday may the 19th preached on the street and they kicked him off the street now remember this is the messenger of that day sunday may the 26th he preached in a meadow and was chased out by by a bull that was turned loose during the service preached sunday june ii preached out out at a ridge of town and was kicked off of the highway on sunday june the 2nd in the afternoon service preached in a pasture field 10 000 people came to hear the word you can't stop god i like that sometimes when we look at things as their failures you're only getting ready for a breakthrough amen amen god bless you let's read the word this morning i'd like for you to turn to hebrews chapter 12 and verse 1. this is the scripture that ignited me to preach the gospel i had heard men i had heard what they had said i'd heard a lot of things i felt unctioned but god's words greater than any other we're foreseeing we are also compassed about was so great a cloud of witnesses we know who they are let us lay aside every weight and every one of us has got to lay aside every weight as an individual you got to do it and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us this is where we must look we must focus looking unto jesus the author and the finisher of our faith who for the joy was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of god if you have a wife take her by the hand if you don't have a wife take yourself by the hand amen you're a child look over at your brother and say we're not going to fight today and hope that stands up for service at least for the service and so amen today is the first sunday of the rest of this year let's ask god that this be the greatest ever and with a deep dedication and a deep sincerity in your hearts amen god bless you let's pray lord jesus we dedicate this day and this service to you lord we fill your special presence in the building this morning so good to have so many wonderful friends with us we ask you that you would anoint us in a very supernatural way god we ask you that you would come and do a direct word in our lives lord we ask you to take the words that god that you have anointed us to speak this morning those words are already anointed but you see our flesh the things that we struggle with i asked you this morning that you would bring a strength touch our hearts today in jesus christ's name we pray a man and a man and a man you may be seated god bless you turn to your neighbor and say let's have church every generation must have its own revival every generation my mother had a revival your grandmother had a revival your great-grandmother had a revival for many of us here in the local area the early pentecostal people were made fun of even shot through the windows bullets would fall off of the dresses as the sisters would dance in the spirit of god it was incredible revival there revivals have came and gone and and the fires have went out in different things and men have denominated it god never did denominate it but men denominated it but we must understand that we are called for this day when god is predestinated he knows what day you'll be born what hour you'll be born but he's also not just seeing that he could do it but he's making sure he has a purpose for your life he has a purpose for your life as great as god is in his pre-planning he has a purpose for your life and for your being here there's junctions that we come to we realize that if this age is going to be the final and we're the final voice to the final age then we are the final runners i was i just made a personal note here i i wasn't going to share it i'll just share it with you in my own personal way i have spoken many through the years probably 30 years of watch night services or our first sunday services of the year and i've stood there encouraging people that this next year would be a year to where that you would deeply con consecrate your life to god and be more sincere rededicating things shoring up things that are loose in your lives getting a re-baptism of the holy ghost because that's the seal of god inside of you we must have that fire or that life of god not enough to have intellectual experiences or be able to explain the bible but it's got to live on the inside of us over the last couple of years circumstances have changed for us as i was just writing some notes this this week and i was thinking as i would be standing here i was thinking about i was thinking in my own self could this be my last dedicational service of the new year if it is i'm not going to stand as a coward i'm going to face the circumstances of life and i'm going to allow the purpose of god to be completed in my life i will not do it with fear i will not do it with cowardness i will not do it with negativity but i will give it with every inch of every strength of i've got in my life are you with me now i'd like to remind you as i would that's not a negative thought there but i'd like to remind you of a buoy as he is dying in the alamo he's been shot up they're getting ready to to to battle probably their final battle actually a line has been drawn in the sand if you're if you want to if you want to leave leave we're going to die here but if you want to leave leave try to escape with your life but if you're going to stay we're going to stay and we're going to fight with everything that is within us david bowie had been shot up and he was very wounded near unto death he said roll me over and he said put a knife in my hand yes he died that day in a ferocious battle but so did five of his his enemy died laying on his body they carried the news to his mother and she said uh how did you find him laying i'll guarantee you there wasn't a knife or a bullet in his back i'd like for that to be said about you and i we're not a bunch of cowards we're not a bunch of wimps in this layout of sea and age somebody's going to make a rapture i want to be one of them c.s lewis would make the statement he said may hell rejoice the day i die you think about that for a little while hallelujah that means you've been tormented to the devil sometimes we got the picture wrong it's not him that's tormenting us but we're tormenting him it may be this morning that there will be men and women that are sitting here that you'll make a final choice you're today what you are because several years ago you chose to be what you are now this quite a statement and you'll choose now what you'll determine to be what you'll be five years from today five years from today you may be a missionary five years from today you may be a renowned christian i'd like to be that five years from today you may be in hell because you made a wrong decision five years from today you may be cleaning spit tunes in a bar room five years from today you may be a prostitute on the street or maybe you'll be a man and woman that's a credit to society because of a choice that you made for christ five years from today you may be in glory gone in the rapture because you made your choice today but you've got to choose you don't look at what you see choose what you see by faith that's the only thing that will count is what you choose by faith lot had to make a choice we see how that worked out you're going to have to make a choice now nobody can make that choice for you we blame teachers we blame presidents we blame we blame a lot of different people we blame pastors because we think that it makes it easier on our guilt to point blame at somebody else because of our failures but let me just say this to you there comes a reckoning day where you and you alone stands before the great creator the great judge himself and then this span of time you've been given a on a time to make a choice based on free moral agency you had a you had a time to make a choice in your life and people are what they are today because of the choice are you with me they are today because of a choice that they made and and maybe you've been a christian for decades but decades ago you made a choice god was pulling on your heart and that pulling you made a choice to move toward him election placed a seed on the inside of you and that predestinated seed caused the pool to go in that direction maybe you were one in a family one in a community that went that way but god rich in mercy many times even overrides your choice and continues to come back after you thank god for that but i think about this what will i be five years from today i don't know about you but i keep a calendar and on that calendar i put my weight last year and then i put my weight this year i put my weight every sunday morning i'm up just a little bit this week if you really want to know thank god for christmas and new year's and everybody makes a decision well i'm going to do this and i'm going to do that that makes resolutions of what they're going to do over the coming weeks 99 of those will quit it is a time to where that gym membership goes through the roof huge gems make a living on january intentions promises that they'll be february march april all the way to december those gyms will be mostly empty until january again it's kind of like i heard a fella say well if it's the large will i find a parking spot at the krispy kreme donuts and he said i'd like to thank the lord on the 13th round around the thing i found a parking spot you say well brother ron i'm nobody let me just say you are somebody god made you special you may not like your looks you may not like your build you may not like your hair color you may not like your eyes but god arranged what you would look like he had this one to marry this one and this one to marry that one and protected your natural seed all the way down through and he watched over you and you said well brother on god never did nothing for you to get you here was a phenomenal miracle maybe it was your great great grandfather that was in a foxhole and just something told him jump over in that next hole and just at the jump a bomb went off i've heard that over and over and over again i've walked in ireland i've walked in in belgium where the wars took place i've seen the great bunkers that are there how many men died on those banks of the sea how many men we're at another spot more people have died to covet than died in those wars it's a sad deal it's more than a political deal it's a devil it's a real devil great men have died poorest of men have died women have died children have done but there's still a blood that can take care of us are you with me now the scripture says in revelation chapter 3 and verse 21 to him that overcometh this is an action scripture this is a prophecy scripture to him that overcometh this is the laodicean age that we're reading from to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and am sat down with my father in his throne i'll get to some of those thoughts in just a moment numbers chapter 14 and verse 24 but my servant caleb because he had another spirit with him and hath followed me fully will i bring into the land wherein to he went and his seed shall possess it quite a powerful quite a powerful thing some way or another he made a choice i've been here now 40 years in this message i want my mountain may be older i may be weaker but god promised he'd give me my mountain i want it in romans 12 and verse 1 i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy and acceptable unto god which is a reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is a good and acceptable and perfect will of god my brother ron but i've got so many troubles in my life what about sarah what about sarah enduring 90 years of not having a child what about job don't even have to say any more there nobody's ever had a week or two like job had with a year of trial that he had to go through nobody's ever had a week like that isaac endured the blindness but it was the plan of god god had to have him blind because he would have never picked jacob even the devil must be amused that god picked you hallelujah shadrach meshach and abednego god was with them in a field he was with them on their jobs he was with them in their homes but he was definitely with him in the fire sometimes we think we're not protected until we're in the fire sometimes we think we're not going through anything until after the miracle is over and we say god was with us but you don't realize he's with you for decades before that but it's after you've come through it and the car sailed a certain way and you didn't die you get out and give glory to god but it was like the miles before without watching over the child when somebody would have grabbed it and took it away and you just there just in the nick of time god was with him all the time come on church bartimaeus as we heard last night was blind but there was god there to take care of him maybe many days he wrestled with the experience of being blind there was legion wandering around in the tombs he didn't get there yesterday but jesus knew where he was at i want you to understand this morning no matter how bad your situation is jesus is walking through the tombs of your life and he knows exactly where you're at and he's not ashamed of your condition he's not ashamed of your situation and he's more than able to deliver you from that the devil whispers in her ear that god has forgotten us how many has ever felt like you've been forgotten felt like nobody loved you how many has ever been told nobody loves you nobody cares about wow there's nobody ever been as sick as you are what a stupid devil if you start believing him ain't nobody been as sick as you are you're still alive that counts for somethin you're still breathing don't let the devil whisper lies in your ear when you get down don't you know that god's still the same god when you're healthy as when you're sick and just in case it is your last breath look where you going and look where he's going [Applause] god's always on time lazarus could testify to that this morning he's always on time when daniel was in a lion's den yes they were real lines cause in a few days they'll eat the accusers those same lines in a few days will eat the accuses they were hungry that day but there was somebody standing with daniel that was greater than the king line are you with me i want you to know in your trial you may not see him you may not feel him but he's there with you [Applause] hallelujah any good to us he's got a stone for your slink he's got fireproof suits for you to walk around in a fiery furnace as a matter of fact he can help you walk on water if the need needs to apply sometimes we need to count it all joy as we heard last night when we're counted worthy to go through situations of life when he says if you trust me i'll use you like never before it is not you that's building the bridge across to the other side you're just walking where's the end of the tunnel don't worry about the end of the tunnel where's the light that's at the end of the tunnel where's the other side of this bridge it doesn't matter where we're going to land but we're going to be with him our god defeats every devil there's not one he can't defeat i wish i had a loud speaker to hell to tell every one of them today all of you are defeated in the name of jesus christ now i'd like to have the loudspeaker to every christian and remind you god has defeated every devil in hell what do you have to be afraid about winston churchill told us to never give up never never never give up miriam was dancing today she grabbed a tambourine and she began to dance because of all of her taskmasters we're dead and if we could only realize tonight that your taskmaster is dead and he's only a haunted image that's trying to remind you of what your yesteryear was that was like you'd grab your tambourine today i sent this to to my family this week and i i told him this is a quote that i found i didn't tell him it was my quote do not complain about what you permit amen do not complain about what you permit people stay with the husband that beats on them the reason that that's going on is you permit it the first time you he laid his dirty rotten hands on you and he's too big a coward to hit another man you should have walked away and realized that you made a mistake i don't know if you paid attention to when billy graham's funeral took place but his daughter gave a testimony she married a man that she thought was mr wonderful that presented himself as mr wonderful to the community was mr wonderful but the first night behind closed doors she recognized what a demon he was she got in the car in the middle of the night and drove herself back to billy graham's house and she said she was expecting judgment and said she found her daddy standing on the porch with his arms wide open [Music] full of grace and full of mercy and full of protection papa god's greater than billy graham a story that you may not know brother branham said in a in a hotel one night because there were some men making some boats about their little girls and brother branham set with a rifle on his lap looking out the window because he was protecting his children now let me just say this to you pastors we preach sermons that are difficult because we're trying to protect the enemy away from you we'll call out to you and make it individual maybe not in front of an audience but we may speak to you privately that's that of love not out of hate or mischief or just because we can do it i thank god there's a god that can discern the thoughts of the heart and know the enemy that is trying to attack a person to bring it down any good shepherd any good shepherd across america or around the world they're trying to protect sheep not beat them i think that this place is a place to come to be encouraged to be inspired to be anointed to have fresh vision for tomorrow we don't come here to be beaten bashed and knocked around and make you do something you need to fall in love with jesus that's all we need to do that's my courage if you fall in love with jesus you don't have to fall in love with me but if you fall in love with jesus he'll cure every situation in your life we have friends driving from four hours from north carolina you come not to be beat around knocked around frail around you come to be encouraged you come to be strengthened you come to having a revival in your heart maybe one sentence in a sermon and you'll talk about it for hours going back down the road i was praying about that very thing and god spoke to me in that sermon he spoke to me in that song whether you drive 4 hours or 15 minutes it doesn't matter the thing that you do is break through the realm of flesh [Music] jesus knows what it is to have a headache he was crowned with thorns jesus knows what it is to be hungry because he fasted for 40 days jesus knows what it is to be slandered he knows what it is to be abandoned jesus knows what it's like to be a refugee to flee homeland and live under oppressive governments jesus knows what it is to mourn and weep he knows what pain and grief is when he came to the tomb of his friend jesus knows what it is to have heard hands and your feet and burned flesh torn and a heart broken look at what jesus went through with the agony of the garden carrying the cross being mopped spat nails driven through his hands being scourged terribly suffered many things for mine in your sake no matter how bad that we have it we could never feel the agony that jesus felt but he didn't do it for himself he did it for you jesus knew what it was like to weep for the knot to stir death right in the eye and tell it it was defeated jesus knew what it was like to be in a storm what a storm can do it can cause fear and anxiety jesus knows what your troubles is like so as we start this year let me just say this you jesus has been with you for this length of time do we not trust our future to him [Music] he is the one that rolled the stars that we look at off of the ends of his fingers the north star has never moved the stars of the galaxy they hold their place because god placed them there he's still the captain of the host are you with me now remember this he's infinite he's god he's omnipotent he's omniscient he's on the present he knows all things he has all wisdom he has all time he covers all space and all power he is infinite and if he isn't that he's not god if he can't do all things he's not almighty god but if he's almighty god he can do all things a man told me the other day that he was mad at god really god didn't do them things to you maybe it was a chain of circumstances that happened in your life but sometimes those trials that you went through were for your good. because everything is full you're good and let me just say if it's for you good it's not just to be done to see if it's for your good he's got a purpose that you will be able to turn and some help somebody else that's going through the trial there's not a day that i've been aggravated at god because of cancer but somewhere in this purpose i can turn and try to help somebody else and encourage somebody else are you with me when i was a young man believe it or not i ran i ran different things and i would run and train and do do things and you know in running this race that we've got somewhere there's got to be a starting point generally a gun sounds and you take off somewhere after the first lap you're going to find out did you train right in boxing it is said that in the first round after the hardest punch is thrown your opposition knows how well you trained are you with me now listen you're gonna never whip the devil without training there is no days off i'm not talking about next week there is no days off you have to battle every day you have to train every day [Applause] well i read 52 books and now i think i got it this is the main book this message was sent to make this book live this is the main book you take these words if you abide in me and my words abide in you ask what you will you speaking across your lips because who you are are is a masterpiece to god you were anointed in place for the position of this day now do something with it trying to behave trying to behave you know everybody likes to see the guy that wins the gold at the olympics stands on the podium no matter what nation they'll play the song the anthem across their heart or salute or whatever they stand there with the goal you don't see the untold hours of preparation of getting up at four o'clock in the morning when nobody else is in town getting up and running and exercising and doing certain specific exercises certain resistance training preparation to perform and then on that special day everything's got to be right you watch what you eat you watch what you do you watch what if they can do that for the olympics which if they get poorer will sell that piece of gold but if they can do that for a temporal gift what about you for an eternal gift [Applause] i heard matthew speak on time everybody's got the same amount everybody's got the same amount nobody's given special extra five minutes in a day some people need it but but everybody's given the same and people go i wonder i wonder what i wonder how he got where he got you know we we look at men and i have these notes written down under each messenger there are men anointed to raise up under that message to carry the message on so under our messenger god raised up men now if i got go to start naming names and i'll hurt somebody's feelings well you know i got a long list here laying in front of me and so i might as well hurt a few feelings but when i think about a ned biscuit what he did with his life one of the greatest ambassadors of the world he wasn't rich but one of the greatest ambassadors of the message of this age stood he could have been the premier of canada he could have been one of the wealthiest men that there ever was but he stood as an ambassador of the message all of these years what a reward when i think of donny reagan a man out of kentucky of almost nowhereville that's one of the greatest preachers that ever lived i mean phenomenal and you just staggered thing where'd he get that where did he get that you've you've read the same scripture over and over again but his gift allows him insight but he could have sold it to the world these men are unappreciated in this realm tim pruitt that said in brother branham's meetings in shreveport there said a crippled boy no he didn't get called out they took him maybe to get called out to be prayed for that that his crippledness would leave he didn't get to play like the rest of the boys but god took that boy in a large family he took that boy and made him the spurgeon of this message one of the greatest preachers that ever lived in history go ahead devil get mad i'm talking about not decades i'm talking about history murphy wong from china murphy wong single-handedly has translated over 600 sermons i understand maybe more than that now 600 sermons he translated the bible the king james bible and a revival happened in china and brother caleb was just released from from prison and you can go back and watch it but brother caleb says that what held him in prison was a sermon and it was a sermon that i preached in prison that sermon kept reverberating in his ears encourage yourself and while in prison he led others to the lord he would have never did that on the street listen god's purpose can never be defeated are you with me now brother brandon points to a woman that was that was very powerful in her day and she felt like that they needed a revival in their town she hired an old preacher and she didn't have enough money but she rented a barn she cleaned out all the manure and that meeting looked like it was terribly unsuccessful but at the last service a straggly 12 year old boy with long hair and raggedy clothes walked in and gave his heart to the lord and that man was moody and moody led a half a million souls to jesus christ and it all will be counted for the record of that woman of what's she done are you with me now peter cartwright that preached in this area that was one of the most powerful men that ever lived what way they did they didn't lay on the the the laurels of yesterday they march forward and charge like never before we talk about obstacles i would i would guarantee you that if 30 men walked in here wanted to stop this meeting today it would upset a whole lot of you i may have way too much of peter cartwright on the inside of me peter cartwright walked right down and he fought the first one and he fought the next one and he fought the next one and he whipped 30 men in church and then on sunday morning nobody felt like they had the victory after that converse that took place there on wednesday night and all the other preachers said in this meeting they said ah we we don't feel no anointing he said let me preach and he walked to the pulpit and he preached a sermon called the gates of hell shall not prevail and the service broke out and he preached all evening sunday evening brother tim you hear that he preached all evening sunday evening and they went and the revival broke out and they preached and then on monday they were still there and tuesday they were still there on wednesday afternoon they baptized over 300 people their flame burned their flame burned hot as i listened to the sermons last night williams never spoke better than he did last night losing his father coveted situations out almost a month and now here he is and preached the best sermon stupid devil i just i just sat there and grinned you know the devil thought he'd done knocked him around a bit and he just preached his best sermon right there last night [Applause] in a minute a minute you'll find me i won't say anything that i don't mean because somewhere another you got to back it up pecan pie joe green was supposed to be here next week but due to covet conditions can't be here but i think about the legacy of his father built about 600 churches a poor man he was a poor man by by money rights but he's a rich man in heaven because he saw that there was churches that couldn't there was people that didn't have a church they'd been cast out of their assemblies and now needed a place to worship and he got started in jamaica started in cuba started in different places and he built buildings all over the world maybe people listening to this actually worship in those buildings we have built some buildings all of us have done great work but let me say this to you i think about dan daisley dan was for those that never met him dan was a guy that was a little bit he was he was short like me a little bit rounder than me and he had coke bottled glasses and that little guy could walk out to a pulpit and shake the kingdom of hell he didn't look like a preacher but when he got wound up i'll never forget his last service here he was unannounced he walked in the back door and he said i just wanted to come see you guys i said good you're preaching all right i got something to say you know he just kind of walked out to this pulpit and you as an audience sat there and if you remember what he said he said i think my wife is having an affair and we all just kind of oh it ain't something to tell in public here and he went back in the old testament and found a man that had accused his wife that went before the priest and if he was wrong all of his thigh would brought out she was wrong it would go the other way and he began to preach on what what matthew would talk about a cross-eyed person that had lost focus one eye on the world and one eye on christ and he would preach on too many christians have another lover i find it interesting that that was his last sermon here that he would preach a sermon that would tell us and remind us we don't want to fall in love with this world we only to fall in love with jesus christ no matter what car you drive or no matter what house you live in or relationship that you're involved in make sure that jesus is number one in your life he laughed in the back office he said i took your breath didn't i a fella named wayne lawson walks in our pulpit and he is actually a lawyer with the word of god and he starts out so mild and meek before he's done he's done shook the kingdom of hell whether it's an hour whether it's two hours and he has so laced the word it's just hard to even argue with it and it's not by some intellectual thoughts as a matter of fact you don't get too much intellectual preachers here that think they know anything but you wanna i i try my best to have men that's got fire in their bosom because if you don't have fire down here you'll never have fire out there [Applause] and too many times we've adopted computers and and we've adopted ipads and put quotes together and we've got just good motivational speakers but we need some men that can shake the kingdom of hell [Applause] i can think of the david myers the the david iversons are you with me the ed hammermeisters the kelly hildebrands of the world the jason jacksons the timothy pruitt's the danny stevens the bill hershbergers the timothy of seance brother sergie from russia are you with me i'm sorry i didn't get all your names called but i want to encourage you as men of god we are in the final laps of the race we don't have time to have a picnic we're in a battle [Applause] we hear statements like are you with me somebody say amen somebody praise the lord somebody rejoice so we've all got a part we come to church we all have a part i won't be just a few more minutes but one time i went to a symphony in in washington dc i was one of those gifted children and so i was i was able to be one of two in our county that was allowed to go i was part of a governor's school type thing and so i went to a symphony i didn't realize it would have much bearing on me but it still does today we walked in and we sat down and we were ones of thousands of people sitting there and people came out in their tuxedos and ladies in their black dresses and every one of them had the same type of dress on every man had the same type of tuxedo on there were some guys with us there was a guy with a stick and he was standing there and that that stick didn't mean nothing to me but it meant something to every person now all of those people came from different places and they all were there to play the same sheets of sheet music follow this just for a moment what finds this interesting is my cousin was playing there that day she was a little girl she was four foot ten she was red-headed she was phenomenally gifted she's been dead now about 10 years from cancer she was phenomenally gifted she was my age her name was ella thinking about another ella now i want to preach to you and they walked out there and they played that music and you know nobody had to give their life story nobody had to tell what they were going through but all of a sudden you know it was a horrible racket when they all were warming up flutes warming up trombones were warming up drums warming up everybody was warming up you know the trumpets were warming up it was horrible as a matter of fact you needed earplugs we got there about an hour early and everybody was doing their warm-up but when it came time and the music started preparing people the atmosphere was set now the conductor comes out and he lays his sheet music out that they're all going to play nobody's arguing with the sheet music nobody's arguing with it it is what it is he wrote it we didn't write it it's not fair brother ron he's the writer he's the writer he's the creator well i want to argue with it take it up with him we're the kind of church here that just believes it all so we're not having to tear it out well we don't believe that today then you know we didn't believe that 1400 years ago so we've heard that part out and we did yeah i said they come in and they they start and maybe it's bach or beethoven and everybody plays their part nobody gets out of place everybody plays their part and you may not even understand music but i'm going to tell you what before that thing is over they have moved you emotionally they've got you feeling like clapping screaming shouting they you might not even understand peter and the wolf but they've got your hair feeling like it's standing on the head and that drum and it feels like your heart's beating inside of your chest and you're one of ten thousand people sitting in the audience cause it affects everybody now here's what happens here at church are you with me are you with me this is how it's gonna happen the rest of this year you're gonna drive four hours and you're gonna anticipate what kind of music we're gonna play today and you're gonna maybe drop 15 minutes or 30 minutes or 40 minutes and you may have went through every valley that you possibly could have went through every turmoil that you could have went through the devil may have whispered every part in your ear and you may not put on a tuxedo but you walk in and you take your place and whether you know this or not thousands of angels are in attendance and they're standing more of them than it is of us and you know once you get seated it don't matter what you went through are you getting it now i've taken about an hour to get you to this spot everything that you went through this week it don't matter everything you're getting ready to go through this week it don't matter he's got it and the sermon might be choosing of the bride and the pastor or whoever's preaching just starts winging his and you go start going all across the audience amen amen and you start playing your flute and you're trumpeting your trombone and you start playing you're part of the music because it's something on the inside of you playing that is greater that is greater than you yourself what does this have to do with legacy brother ryan i mentioned names here today and i've already argued with myself about it and evidently i lost that it's not right to compare one with another because that's carnal so i wasn't comparing them i was just telling you that the donny reagan and the tim pruitt and the ed biskull and the joe and each and every one of those ministers and i could mention other preachers sitting here each one of them given their opportunity to ran their race with everything that was within them now we would ask ministers to do that we want our all of us to do that give it our all i want to finish with this john wesley was turned down over and over and over again and finally he found a pastor field and not only in that pastor field he found ten thousand people that wanted to hear the word i'm thankful we've got a group of people that wants to hear the word you're not worried about church politics but we don't want it we're not worried about who and who's who's who because it don't matter if you're concerned about what somebody else is dressed like you know you've got your eyes on the wrong focus are you with me and if you're concerned with somebody else you know will they ever catch up pray for them and if they're stumbling fall and catch them by the arm and sleeve and try to help them because we're all in this together a legacy is what a man is remembered by and i don't want to be remembered as a coward and today is the first day of the next five years i want that next five years when i get there to be known as a real christian many years ago i said this take a picture of where you are now and where you will be five years from now for good measure i looked back five years ago of my own life and i was glad i was where i was five years ago preaching in the conventions i was glad to be there and stand there and i can tell you about the miracles that happened in those meetings but i can tell you about the god that lives today and you know what i may have had one of my most difficult nights last night and i may have humanly told my wife if i ever felt like not preaching today's that day yeah i told her that this morning but did i let that bother me i think not let it be said at the end of the day he shook himself and he got himself out of bed let me give you an english accent got himself out of bed and got himself ready for church and he went to church and he shook the kingdom of hell glory hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] we are not made out of running material how many will stand with me today brother ron can't you see we're standing i'm not talking just about that i'm talking about five years from today young people five years from today five years from today getting it wonderful getting it wonderful amen we could have a general altar call just now but i want to just i want you to pray right where you're at and i want you to talk to the lord you don't need somebody to tell you where you're at you know you know but all of us need more of jesus i just have to say that all of us need more of jesus some of you may be further up the road than i am but all of us need more of him we're on a journey we're walking the journey we need him by that take us by the hand and lead us and sometimes we need him to carry us i'd like for you to talk to him with your lips today i'd like to i'd like for you to ask him to come father come i'd like to lay aside some weights that's besetting me i'd like for you to help me and god i need you to encourage me and strengthen me and as i look on the new year things that i can't see uncharted waters where we'll go
