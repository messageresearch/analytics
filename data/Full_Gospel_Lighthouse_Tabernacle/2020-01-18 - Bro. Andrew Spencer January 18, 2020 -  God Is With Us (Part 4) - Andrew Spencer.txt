heart it's good to be back in the house of the Lord fighting a battle one more time and we are here reporting for duty this evening so we're going to take this this start and continue with God is with us and so where's the cat so hey man God is with us and we will see miracles amen this is the time like never before the grandest of all ages the darkest of all ages we're called here to win this battle no man and we will win hey man god bless you if you have your Bibles this evening look over in the book of Matthew chapter 1 and verse 23 and then down to Hebrews chapter 1 and verse 1 man appreciate it every song this evening a man a man we live in a world where everybody wants to talk about everything else but God they want to kick God out of the get God out of the school system's kicked God out of prayer kick God out of their home but I like talking about God it's my favorite thing to do if you around me very much you'll know where I'm going to lead in in my conversations and so I don't know how long the Lord will leave us on this thought but however long he does I hope you don't mind me talking about the God that I serve I don't know too much about the gods of the worlds but I do know about this God the God who wrote that Bible the God that changed my life that's the God I want to tell you about and man Matthew chapter 1 and verse 23 behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name Emmanuel which being interpreted is God with us hebrews chapter 1 verse 1 I say man when you have it this evening God who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in tongues passed under the fathers by the prophets hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of all things by whom also he made the world's being the brightness of his glory and the Express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself by himself by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high I mean here's a need that you'd like to take before the father this evening man let's just bow our hearts before him Heavenly Father would come to you and the most precious name that there is the name of our Lord and our Savior Jesus Christ the God that is our strong tower and you are a refuge Lord you are our peace and Lord it is our privilege Lord that we could just gather around the table as it were this evening and just to be able to feast upon the fresh manna Lord there are certain things in our life we've known scriptures we've read over quotes and we've had things Lord that that have ministered to our lives but Lord we need a fresh word from you today Lord and Lord not that not that the word that we have had is is is not necessarily it is it isn't that it doesn't mean something to us but Lord we want something direct from you father for this moment that we're in Lord we know that that all Scripture was given by the inspiration of God but Lord we want that we want that scripture father we want that word from you that will that will speak to our life and have such an effect on our life that it'll that it'll change the course of our human abilities and it'll change the way we think can change the way we speak Father and lord we we know that we're just mortal men but Father that's exactly what you chose to preach Lord to your to your children you could have chose the trees or the wind or anything but you chose you chose men and father we pray that you would take redeem vessels the semen and speak to redeem that so that we pray that you'd hear through redeemed vessels Oh God and we pray that you would do exceedingly abundantly above all that we could ever ask or think Lord according to the power that's working within us we've asked supernatural things we've asked for major things we've asked for things of mighty and stature but Lord that scripture says that that whatsoever things we desire when we pray we believe that we shall receive them and Lord you take you seem to never let us down but you always go to the next level Lord we can ask something but you always give something better and father I pray that whatever their hand is up tonight about I pray that you administer to them on that need upon that situation that they would hear from you today one word will change their life and so we pray God that you would come I know that you're interested in every person here this evening and I pray that you'd speak to them in such a way that they would say that that was none other than Jesus speaking we love you Lord if all our hearts we commit our ways unto you and we believe that you'll give us the desires of our heart in Jesus name Amen man god bless you may be seated this evening the Word of God to us is such a very precious thing we don't take it for granted when we flip back the pages of the Bible and begin to read over in the scriptures and we read of these things we don't take those things for granted we don't take them very lightly either but we realize that that these things are a divine communicate to you and I that these are the divine Oracles of God and we'll realize that that the Word of God is a power and we realize that nothing can stop the Word of God and Jesus would say that heaven and earth will pass away but my word will never pass away and we realize that the Word of God has a force behind it and and that force is life and we realize that this is the Living Word of God in written form to you and I and we realize that it is his word that upholds all things that it bears all things that it strengthens all things that it's his word of power that creates the world that we even live on today the manifested Word of God is is what we are standing upon and we must realize that there is such power in the Word of God and there is there is that there is nothing that can defeat the Word of God the Prophet would tell us that the Word of God will defeat Satan anytime anyplace under any circumstance that the Word of God will always prevail it will always win and we realize that that God desired to become human flesh because he had attributes that he wanted to display himself in he had attributes of faith Savior and father and all these things that were in him so Jehovah became manifested in the flesh and when he was here on earth he said he was God he looked like God he talked like God he even preached like God hallelujah he healed like God he rose like God he ascended like God he was God he was God in the flesh he was he was God in him God was in his son manifesting himself to his people and all that was in all that was in God he poured into Christ and all that was in Christ he he poured into the into the church and we see that same God that we read over in the Old Testament we see him in action in the form of his son the Son of God and when he walked on the shores of Galilee we watched as God was displayed in human flesh by the name of Jesus we watch God work we watch God he'll we watch God deliver we watched God speak peace to storms we watched God walk down to the widow of nain son that was there and he was dead and and maybe all hope was gone for her but when he laid his hand on the bear and said bring it near we were not watching a man we were watching God in a man who ever walked we watched him as he walked up to thee he walked took to the tomb of Lazarus and he was afraid and I and he was and he was sad because his friend had died anybody that's got a real friend or you're a real friend to somebody you're gonna cry bout him and he was a man when he was crying there but we watched more than a man when he said Lazarus come forth and the prophet said that there was so much power in his word that if he wouldn't have named Lazarus by the name it would acosta general resurrection because there is power in the world of Jesus and we realized that if he that if God had so much power in that man and we watched God working it was God in flesh but God did not desire for this just to be in one man but he desired for that to be in a mini member Bridey called his bride that that she would do the same works the same action same life same power same manifestations that she would look like him she would talk like him she would act like him she would live like him he did not desire that this just be himself and everybody would come to him but he had a purpose in coming that he could redeem a lost people that he could bring them to a spot into a position of who she is and what he thought of her before the foundation of the world and God intended that word of power would not only live in him but he would live in human beings just like you and I and we look back over in the book of John chapter 18 and we see that when the Pharisees and and then the chief priests and the band of men came after Jesus that they walked up to Jesus while he was there in the garden and all of his disciples around him and they they coming to Jesus and Jesus said whom do you speak and they said geez and when Jesus said this there was so much power in his word he said I am he and when he spoke these words the Bible said that the men fell backwards onto the ground there was so much force in his word it was not it was not the man it was not the flesh but it was a God that was behind that word that I am he and I want to say this to you that that same one the same he that walked on the shores of Galilee is walking in human flesh right here in Elkton Virginia there's a people on earth that embody the Holy Ghost the baptism of God they embody his spirit his life hello yeah there is power in the spoken word and this I'm not talking about I'm not just talking about you speaking the word or just speaking what you want to come into existence but when you take up home speaking what Jesus had you will watch miracles take place your watch phenomena's take place it was the word that knock the enemy down and it will be the enemy it will be it will be this word that knocks your enemies down in 2020 hallelujah this is not only in written form but in a people a people that I have the same positions the same potentials and the same actions just like Jesus did and we watch and we will recall that when when the Prophet went over to Germany by a vision that there were witch doctors there that were that were trying to cause a ruckus and trying to destroy the meeting there and and the witch doctors they would take feathers and they were Korean and they were chanting and transmits and trying to bring up a storm and and they were trying to shut down that meeting and the end the tip began to breathe life lion laying like it was taken off of the ground and those witch doctors were chanting enchantments trying to stop this and brother Branham told the interpreter he said don't you interpret this he said you are the Lord Lord God you give me a vision and sent me to Germany these witches has brought up this storm you're the god of creation let it be known that you are God and all of a sudden in less than five minutes the Sun was shining right down through there and right after that fifteen thousand Germans came and gave the heart to the Lord Jesus Christ he's just the same God right now hallelujah this is where we are living in Church that the word has made manifest now in 1959 what was the Holy Ghost given for he said that God poured himself into Christ correct Christ poured himself in the church so therefore now watch out that day you will know you will know that I am in the father and you are me and I am in you at that day you'll know it for it's the whole thing is one plan of redemption coming down that God can come that God coming back to live in and dwell with and commune to his people as he did at the beginning now then as soon as he gets his church in speaking conditions he gets his church to a place that he can flow himself through and love and persuade and fellowship then now come and eat him when he gets his church on speaking conditions you know when you and your wife where maybe she was your girlfriend you kind of danced around the idea that you were boyfriend and girlfriend maybe maybe thought about maybe thought about becoming a couple and you didn't necessarily tell everybody everything you didn't tell her everything but when she became your wife you begin to reveal your secrets to her and tell her all those intricate details of your life of how you were made of all of your financial status and now God has a people that has been speaking conditions they know his financial status they know where he lives that they know what he stands for they know what he believes and what he said is her command and she does it in the save the Lord there's a people that is on the face of the earth the Prophet said that there's been churches churches Brides Brides but there's got to come on I say to you in the rest of the world she's here she not only has the mechanics but she's got the dynamics hallelujah that makes the church live and move in the power of the resurrection of Christ oh yeah we're serving a God who is and has and will continue these supernatural acts and works he made supreme promises and he will have supreme results this is the year that God is with us as he has been but this is a year that I have theme that God is with us and we're going to see miracles but to have miracles you got to have extreme things extremist situations huge obstacles that you can't figure out that doctors can't figure out that human beings can't figure out that's a miracle when nobody can put their finger on it and make it happen but a miracle watch it come into existence in a matter of seconds there's gotta be huge opposition for a miracle to take place and we are in the midst of a miracle making moment [Applause] oh I'm not talking about your flesh I'm not talking about your sickness I'm talking about a body change there's a huge obstacle that is standing between you and I and that rapture and you're getting ready to watch the greatest miracle that's ever hit the face of the earth you know what God is good enough to he'll take care of your sickness he's good enough he'll take care of his eyes on earth but he's got something bigger in store it's bigger than your sickness it's bigger than your problem it's bigger than your trials you got a body change Church don't get your eyes on what's going on right here get your eyes on what he said behold the hour that you think not the Son of Man is coming I say it's just around the corner oh yeah we got to have extreme things extreme huge obstacles for miracles to take place when I found in life that God works in the impossible you don't find God working in the possible and making it possible you find God working in the impossible and making it possible he fulfilled every seven he fulfilled all the seven compound names of Jehovah Jehovah Shama that the Lord is there he's there with you in your trouble he's there with you in good times he's there with you in bad times he's there when you feel him he's there when you don't he's there when you serving him and he's still there when you won't he's there when the money is good and he's there when the money ain't there he's there when you got a Cadillac and he's there when you got a pencil he's there when you don't know you don't have the money to buy new shoes he's there he's always there he's a God that will not leave you he's a God that will not forsake you he said I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world he's a God that ain't leaving you will have friends walk away from you young people but I want you to know there's a friend that's take it closer than a brother he said I'm not gonna leave you when you're going through the valley of the shadow of death I'm gonna be right there with you you ain't walking through it alone I'm right there with you I'm with you on the mountain I'm with you in the valley he's that kind of a God hallelujah but you've got to realize that we are in a struggle between death and life and you gotta realize that death wants to destroy you death is after you it's doing its very best to come after you tonight but I want you to realize this that death is harnessed by God that sickness is harnessed by God that demons are harnessed by God and they cannot come near God's children unless God allows it and if God allows it it shows that he's got confidence in you he'll remember over in the book of Job that job that Satan swore that he would make job curse God to his face and I want you to notice the confidence that God had in job he said I don't believe you can do it you talk about the confidence that God has in his children he's got confidence in you that if he sent you through the fire if he sends you through the waters if he sends you through the mud that you'll not curse him God wouldn't send you through it if he didn't believe that you would still come out on the other side lifting up the name of Jesus Smart's we've seen battle after battle after battle but what did we do every single time we celebrated the victory I don't care what you are facing you can name the name of it but you can name your banner but let me assure you that God will have the victory [Applause] that's right it showed the faith that God had in job and it showed it showed the faith the job had in God and to think tonight that there's somebody bigger than you and bigger than your problem and bigger than your situation that believes in you even when you don't believe in yourself even when you don't feel like you can go another mile he believes in you even when your health is failing he believes in you even when you feel like praising him or you don't feel like praising him he believes in him you see because he's seen you before the foundation of the world and he's not bothered by your mistakes neither is he bothered by how you handle situations he's seen you in victory he said where was you joke when I saw the sons of God shouting for victory you were in God's mind and God did not see you down here and Laodicea all destroyed and all defeated he seen you sound and if God seen me shouting I'm gonna walk right into that vision lift your head up walk into it you were singing shouting you were singing dance sing hallelujah I'm gonna walk right into faith is gonna stand to the trouble faith is gonna stand through the trial even when the chips are down and you know that you should have said something negative something spoke out of you positive you know when you don't feel good but something speaks out of you something on the inside is working on the outside when the chips were down and Satan thought that he would curse that you would curse God something spoke out of you faith goes to talk I think this is the time that we all let a faith talk I faith in ain't in a man ain't in man's wisdom Paul said that I came not to you with enticing words of man's wisdom but I came under you with the power and demonstration of the Holy Spirit that your faith would not stand in the wisdom of man but in the power of God I faith ain't standing at what man is saying or what signs his hand I faith is standing upon the power of God and if God said he do it God will bring in the past if God made a big promise he'll bring a big result he said I am THE LORD thy God that heals all of your diseases he said I'd make your head and not the tail you may be at the bottom of the barrel but I want you to get ready you're getting ready to float to the top the rain is coming get the barrels ready [Applause] hello faith don't stand on how you feel our faith is resting in the power of God brother madam said that faith finds the word its sanctuary of rest that's where faith is setting that tonight faith ain't setting over here on what you say faith is setting over here on the word notice this he said it moves right up on top of that eternal rock Christ Jesus the word and it lays down there that's where faith rest at faith climbs all the way up it may be a big old mountain but faith climbs all the way up on top of the eternal rock whoo hallelujah sometimes it takes a mountain sometimes a trouble see but faith has failed its resting place and it climbs up on top of it sometimes we want to get over yourself sometimes you got to get over your own pity party and get up and pull yourself up on top but the eternal Rock hello somebody this is our sanctuary he said let the winds howl that the storm shake she safe evermore she rests right there on that word that's where faith genuine faith rests resting place is the word notice for it knows that God will ever prove himself superior over every one of his enemies it ain't your job to prove God right it's God's job I ain't gotta prove I've got the victory he said I've got it for it knows that God will ever prove his self superior over every one of his enemies let him up let him up he will prove himself superior over every one of his enemies no matter how bad it looks no matter and how how how the enemy has come in how it looked like your defeated faith still knows faith is a little bit faith is a little bit cocky I know I caught out probably twenty percent of everybody on the internet just cut off but that's okay but the Prophet said faith still knows faith ain't backing up hallelujah faith is got it's got hair on its chest and it's got great big muscles faith knows what it is you are not building your faith upon faith you're building your faith upon God's Word that's why faith can rest there and say you know what I don't care what the situations look like it knows faith knows what it's looking at faith don't see your problem faith don't see your situation faith sees what God said and my God said is eternal if he said that he gives you a brand new body he's gonna give you a brand new body if it said he'd Olivia faith knows that he'll deliver you come on somebody if he said is gonna give you a baby they knows he's gonna give you baby let your face start talking if faith knows that God said that he'd prosper you and make you who you be faith will speak faith will move faith will live your body's going to tell you that you can make it but faint says she can't make it your body's gonna tell you that Jake strong enough but thanks s are strong enough faith knows faith is resting faith is taking a nap in God's Word seyton the blood is against you faith knows faith says I can take it they says I can make it they says I'm not old now I'm not I'm not a survivor faith says I'm an overcomer they've says that I am NOT defeated I'm victorious because faith is crawled up on top of the word me down to sleep I pray I pray my soul faith ain't worried about if there's lines outside faith ain't worried if your sickness outside faith in word if there's car trouble outside whoo faith knows faith says that all things are possible to them that belief these things are not just for God Church God believed his word but do you believe what God said jesus said if you say to this mountain he didn't say if I say to this mountain but if you let it come across your lips faith knows that the mountains got to move hallelujah faith knows it he said air is where faith takes its resting place where it knows that God will never never he will never never let the enemy ride over top of him he never has faith no sex so regardless what the thing look like bhudev no one knowed that the Ark would float Daniel know that God could close the lion's mouth the Hebrew children knew that God could stop the fire and jesus knew that God would raise him up for the scripture said in Psalm 16 that I will not leave your soul in Hell neither will I allow corruption to set in jesus knew what the word had said about him and faith knows what the word says about you faith knows what the word says about you and the devil knows what it says about you the devil you can get yourself in a good old competition quoting scripture to the devil and I guarantee you every time that he'll weep he will beat you in a competition of saying what the scripture says you see he knows what the scripture says and I like to remind him that he knows what the scripture says I like to take him back to the back of the book that when he is cast into a pit where I'm standing that I like to remind him that over over in the Book of Revelations that the Bible says that he was heading on a white horse and he had his name and the title of his name was the Word of God and there was a host coming with him and I like to remind him that I am a part of that host that I am sin here not only to destroy him in this age but I am sin here to torment him for evermore faith knows what the word says turn with me to Isaiah 44 ain't God good to give us so many blessings well I was what you don't need holler back at me undeserved that's what we are ain't got good to give us so many blessings god is good all the time and all the time Isaiah 44 yet now here o Jacob my servant and Israel whom I have chosen let's save the Lord that made thee inform be from the womb which will help thee fear not o Jacob my servant and and thou just her on whom I have chosen for I will pour water upon him that is thirsty and floods upon the dry ground I will pour my spirit upon my seed and my blessing upon that offspring brother's Angela your baby ain't even here yet but the Bible said that I will pour a blessing upon my offspring your baby ain't getting here for what another six months but before the baby ever got here it's already got a blessing pronounced over top up and to think that God seen me coming from the very beginning I can't even imagine that the blessings that are stacked up upon you and I that's why Satan hates you is because you're blessed before the foundation the wall and Satan has been cursed from the foundation of the world you were born to be a victor and he was born to be defeated and they saw spring up is among the grass as willows by the watercourses once I say that I am the Lord then another circle himself by the name of Jacob and another shall subscribe with his hand unto the Lord and surname himself by the name of Israel verse 6 thus said the Lord the king of israel and his redeemer the lord of hosts I am the first and I am the last and beside Z there is no God and who as I shall call and shall declare it and said in order for me since I appointed the ancient people and the things that are coming and shall come I appointed these things that are coming and the ancient people and the things that are coming and shall come and let them show unto them fear ye not neither be afraid have not I told me from that time and have I declared it ye are even my witnesses whoa hallelujah is there a God beside me you're his witnesses is there any other God that's got a power like this God you're his witnesses is there any other God that's got wisdom like a god you're his witnesses is there any other God that's got the power to heal you power to deliver you you are his witnesses is there a God beside me I say absolutely not and then God confirms that yea there is no God and I know not any give the Lord some praise tonight hey no God like my god there's no God like to Hoover there's no God like to Hoover there's no God like to Hoover there's no God like to Hoover there's no God like Hoover there's no God like Jehovah there's no God like Jehovah ain't no God like my god he never lost the battle and he don't intend on losing one now I know somebody he healed from the beginning and he'll heal now He blessed from the beginning and he'll bless now I am the Lord that God and I change not I'm Hebrews 13:8 I am the same yesterday today and forever the promises of God are yay and amen you can tell on him he knows no other God but he calls all the stars by their name he knows all of his children before they were formed in the womb he saw Isaac coming before Sarah met Abraham he saw fire shut up in Jeremiah's bones he saw job restored with a double portion before he was ever afflicted he saw the well before jonah ever needed him he saw lines before daniel was ever cast into the pit and he sees every time and anytime that satan plans to afflict you he knows what's coming and he sees it afar off and he gods trouble so that we are molded into the image that he thought of us he sees all things he knows all things but this God can't see one ounce of your sin [Applause] there's none like him number sod him number for him and that God lives on the inside of me ain't none like it you're gonna look over in the book of First Samuel Chapter five and you can go over there and you can look that when the Philistines came in and they took the Ark of God and placed it in the temple in the temple of Dagon that they said the Ark of God up there beside their God akin which was a fish God half fish half female God that they set there and they worship but this God didn't have no power to begin with but they set the most powerful God right Masonic and when the Philistines went to bed that night when they rose up the next morning they come back and they looked in the temple and Dagon was flat on his face worshiping the true God but here's what I love about this is that the Philistines had to picked their God up and put him back in place my god don't have to be picked up he's the God that picks me up he's the God that gets me when I fall I ain't got a worry about getting God when he falls he ain't falling so they pick their God back up and put him back in place they went their self and they went back to bed that night but when they got up the next morning not only was he laying on the ground but his head was cut off and his hands was cut off showing that Dagon had no wisdom showing that Dagon had no power there is no God like our God the enemy that is fighting against you has no wisdom compared to our God he has been stripped of his strength of his power he has no legal rights legal rights he's nothing but a bluff and I'm made out of that stuff that don't Bluff and that came from Calvary here you him I'm quoting a quote if you don't know it oh god what an evil thing Satan is he binds the helpless he comes in by force and he puts the children of God in the corners he puts them in unpleasant situations and he makes you deal with something that you don't want to he puts the children of God in the corners but tonight he's exposed tonight we realize that he's just a bluff he has no legal rights cry stripped him of everything that he had at Calvary everything even fear even fear everything was paid for at Calvary and Satan you don't have any legal rights over God's children how many's God's children and I Satan has no legal right over you they're God's heritage you can't hold them any longer come out of here I adjure thee by Jesus Christ God's own son come out Satan in the name of Jesus God's Son leave this group of people I always hated it when mom put me in the corner hey today I tell you despised getting in the corner I'd rather take a butt whipping get in the corner all you go see there's the spiders that are trying to hide from the pest control man I kind of get custard claustrophobic when I get put in the corner like that I can't see what's coming behind me I definitely ain't gonna take you from the devil I knew better from my mama I'd sit right there till 2:00 told me she told me that I could get up and when she got up I didn't do what I did before they get in that corner but you know every time Satan tries to put me in a corner I go back and I do the same thing that I did before I keep whipping him like I did before when he tried to put me in a corner and he tries to put me back again but God pulled me out of the corner because you know Satan is a defeated foe he is nothing but a bluff and I want to tell you tonight if Satan has put you in the corner you don't have to stay in the corner you ain't gotta put up with that line cheating dip tell the devil I Know Who I am I know what I believe that God that's backing me up is boy he's the one that built you and you're nothing but a toe in his hands I Know Who I am and I know and whom I have believed the Bible said that there's coming a time that we're going to look on him Oh Lucifer and the world is going to say is this the man is this the man that created so much evil in the world and they're gonna look at a man that's completely stripped of power he ain't got no muscles he ain't got no wisdom he ain't got no power and everybody's gonna look at him and say it says the man that calls me so much corruption and so much trouble in my life go ahead and look at him that way he's completely stripped right now I hope you don't mind I'm probably I'm probably gonna close with this part 14 part 15 part 17 is coming but I did a little study yesterday morning while I had a little bit free time and I went through the message what brother branham titled Satan that Satan is you can do it yourself it's over 185 quotes and I read every single one off cuz I told you I was
