there's always been end times there was an end time in Noah's day there was an end time in Abraham's day there was an end time in Moses's day father but here we are in the Final End Time Lord where we see father what you're doing Lord as you're Gathering of people father you're preparing yourself and father there's a table Lord that's spread 1500 miles where thousands upon millions of people the bride of Christ will be sitting there and not one will be out of place father we've come Lord Jesus One More Time Lord to we know that the house of God is where judgment begins and we've come here

father may we just sit down at the tent door Lord may we turn our back father and may we may we just hear you speaking to us through mortal lips father our heart is yours so father I ask that you would just set us aside Lord just now and you'd begin to minister to us according to thy Grace in Jesus Christ name amen amen if you have your Bibles this evening would like to look over in the Book of Joshua Joshua chapter 5 like to say it's it's a blessing to have our brother Dexter here with with us this weekend May God richly bless you for being here all of our other visitors here this weekend so just just want to say God bless you and uh I believe brother Matthew made the announcement about the the youth camp and the kids that are going and if you could just stay after service the parents and the kids there and we want to be remembering the Youth Camp there and pastor and brother brother Glover brother steaman they'll be ministering there and we're just praying that the Lord would do Mighty things and we've seen many many things at at at these youth camps and I'm so thankful for men of God that have a vision to continue to to uh support our youth and to uh to have places for them to come and know that that they're not provoked there but they are there they're they're standing there brothers and sisters that are just like them and just to see that just to see the work of the Lord continuing going on that to that we're grateful amen amen Joshua 5 and verse 1 and it came to pass that when all the kings of the amorites which were on the side of Jordan Westward and all the kings of the Canaanites which were by the Sea heard that the Lord had dried up the Waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel until we were passed over that their heart melted neither was their spirit in them any any more because of the children of Israel at that time the Lord said unto Joshua make these sharp knives and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time and Joshua made him sharp knives and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the forkins and this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise and all the people that came out of Egypt that were males even all the men of War died in the the Wilderness by the way after they came out of Egypt now all the people that came out were circumcised but all that the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt them they had not circumcised for the children of Israel walked 40 years in the wilderness till all the people that were Men of War which came out of Egypt were consumed because they obeyed not the voice of the Lord unto whom the Lord SAR that he would not show them the land which the Lord swar unto their fathers that he would give us a land that floweth with milk and honey notice and their children whom he raised up in their state them Joshua circumcised for they were uncircumcised because they had not circumcised them by the way and it came to pass that when they had done circumcising all the people that they Abode in their places in the camp till they were whole and the Lord said unto Joshua this day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off of you wherefore the name of this place is called gilgal unto this day may God bless his word you may be seated tonight in the presence of the Lord also if you can turn with me over over in the Book of Romans The Book of Romans chapter 9 and verse 23 the Bible says here and that he might make known The Riches of his glory on the vessels of Mercy which he had a four prepared under glory and that that's just wonderful thing to recognize that God has set a predestinated course for us even us whom he hath called not of the Jews only but also of the Gentiles as he saith also in OSI which is Hosea I will call them my people which were not my people and her beloved which was not beloved and you find it amongst the you find it amongst the Hebrew people when you begin to study out their Traditions that that the Hebrew people would take great pride in being called the children of God or or calling themselves of the circumcision but you find that when you study out the when you begin to study out the history and You Begin to look at the Hebrew uh as a n as a national course you begin to look at it that they they would take that that sign of circumcision as a badge of superiority that it was that what it actually did it actually fostered a spirit of exclusivism amongst the amongst the Hebrews there and then that the Hebrews or the Jews would simply regard to the to they would regard the Gentiles as the uncircumcision but I'm so glad to know know that the Bible is very clear upon this on this evidence that that Jesus would even speak about the Gentiles that in his name would the Gentiles trust so notice verse 26 that and it shall come to pass that in the place where it was said under them you are not my people there shall they be called the children of the Living God so even though men may have tried to write us off as Gentiles men of Hebrew or Jewish descent may have wrote off all of the Jew all of the Gentiles but God is saying that they shall be called the children of the Living God Isaiah is also crying crith concerning Israel though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea a Remnant shall be Savor he will finish the work and cut it short in righteousness because a short work will the Lord make upon the Earth and as Isaiah said before except the lord of the Sabbath had left us a seed we had been as Sodom and been made like un gomorah and what shall what shall we say then that the Gentiles which which followed not after the righteousness have attained righteousness that's powerful even the righteousness which is of Faith but Israel which followed after the law of righteousness hath not attained to the law of righteousness wherefore because they sought it not by faith but as it were by The Works of the law for they stumbled at The Stumbling Stone notice what they were stumbling at they were stumbling at the revelation of faith that they were not going to they were simply receiving it upon the works of the flesh but notice verse 33 as it is written behold I lay in Zion a stumbling stone and a rock of offense and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed that's a very key scripture to us as message Believers and behold I lay in Zion as some Stone a rock of offense and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed if you you're very well studied in the message you'll know that that that is the scripture that brother brandham is there in 1962 just before Christmas that brother brandham is sitting there in his room and he and there begin to show the Lord begin to show him a vision of his final Commission of the third pole that there the Lord begin to show him and he said I seen those little birds those little Warriors he said there was no more than there was there was no less than five he said but there was no more than seven there but he said I begin to ask the Lord is this my end is this my end or this or is this another commission or am I going into a new ministry and he said he be to look and he said the Bible was opened I think it's amazing that the prophet would say that the Bible was open to Romans 9 and33 now anybody knows if you got Romans 9:33 there's a whole there's a whole bunch of pages and letters that are before you but the the the scripture that was was so predominant to the prophet is behold I lay in Zion a stumbling Stone a rock of offense that whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed so it's very predominant that this that this what has been given to us is a rock of Revelation and I think it's very very important for us as message Believers that we recognize the hour or the very specific hour that we're living in as the Bride of Jesus Christ that it isn't just it wasn't just Malachi Four's day it wasn't just it wasn't just the prophet's day but it is it is the hour that we're living in of Revelations 10:8 through 11 that thou must prophesy again I believe that it's these moments that we're living in that we ought to recognize and I don't believe that we ought to allow what is happening amongst the body of Jesus Christ to allow those things to just simply pass Us by and not recollect what's going on and just just to move on I want to want to speak to you tonight on this thought of rolling away the reproach and the dawning of a new day the rolling away of the reproach and it's a dawning of the new day and the prophet would use that that terminology in the second seal he said we're so glad today that God is revealing hisself to us and he said I believe that the great day is just beginning to Daw he said it's breaking in the lights the lights are beginning to flash the birds of paradise is beginning to sing in the Saint's heart they know that it is it lone now that something is going to happen it's just got to so the prophet recognized where he was setting at but the Church of the Living God is recognizing that they are living in a moment when the day is beginning to Dawn to think that where we were as a body of Jesus Christ 50 60 years ago but to look at the hour that we're living in that we're not just a we're not just another church we're not just another denomination we're not just another organism but we are physically the living Oracles of Jesus Christ made manifest in the hour and I believe that if God's got scripture that are laying there then the prophet would say in the message Shalom he said then we ought to get in the rhythm of the scripture of the music that if it if he said that Jesus is going to be here then we ought to get in the rhythm of that if he said that there's going to be a millennium then we ought to get in the rhythm of that he said there said there'll be a new day he said there'll be a day that the sun will never go down no more he said we'll need it no more for the lamb is the light of that City he said it's the dawning of a new day he said I feel it all over me right now to think that right now what you feel in the room time and time again it's the dawning of a new day it's not something that it's not something that's going away but it's something that Jesus Christ he saw in you before the foundation of the world but to think that we're living right here we're living right here here when the evening light has shined upon the Church of the Living God and she's not wondering who she is she knows who she is he said the light of a day where there is no light there is no darkness no Shadows no Skies no DM Dark Skies no midnight no Graves no flowers on the hillsides no funeral possessions no doctors no morg no cancer no tuberculosis no trouble it's the dawning of a new day he said I can feel the Rays of his light breaking through upon my soul the new day the old one is pressing away but there's something that is pressing you the light it's just the darkest right before the dawn and I know that darkness is creeping in but do you recognize what light is doing it's pressing it's pushing it's pushing the darkness right out of your life think that when the Church of the Living God had got to a place in Numbers Chapter 13 when they got to a place that we are that is very well known in the scriptures of cadesh barel which is known as the Judgment seat of God what were they at they were at a junction they were at a turning point as a as a congregation or as a church but you remember what the Bible said that when he come to them in Deuteronomy chapter 2 and 3 and said that you have compass pass this mountain long enough it's time to turn northward they had been sitting here they had been squalling back and forth and they'd been fussing back and forth but God was going to raise a generation that was going to fully inherit when there were others that would not move into those possessions or simply said I long to be back with the garlic pots I long to be back there in Egypt but God was going to have somebody that was going to live in the hour that he had destined him to live you see they were wanting and longing to live off of yesterday's Mana they were longing for the experiences of about there in Egypt but we recognize that a prophet said that every generation has a chance at a fresh Revival and I think it's very important that we preach the message the way that the prophet preached it to us and I don't believe that there's any generation that that that needs a fresh Revival like this one if we've got Leo AA that's creeping in like it is if we see the darkness creeping in I say that we need a Revival like never before but it'll never come unless God sends it and many people are waiting for it maybe they're waiting on maybe they're waiting on just certain situations but I want to say this to the Church of the Living God you're in it this is the bride's Revival the return of the spirit of the Lord that pillar fire that stood over our Prophet it was a to this generation that Elohim is now back with his bride's body and he has come back in full manifestation that's why we can sit here under the revealing of the son of man and know that God has called us to a higher place he didn't call us to go back to some wiggle tail experience he called us he called us for fresh manner that's why he would say that you're a high priest because a high priest didn't have to Wi live off of the yesterday's experience but they could go in there and feast off off of the same om fo that Moses and Aaron ate off of because in the presence of the shika Glory the Mana never wasted it never got old that's why you got to have a generational blessing of the Holy Ghost you can't live off your mama's experience you can't live off of your daddy's experience you can't live off your Granddaddy's experience you've got to have a fresh call a fresh experience a fresh anointing a fresh Pentecostal experience where you go back to where the Bible the Bible becomes alive again Hallelujah when you go to look over in Joshua chapter 5 you begin to see that it was time it was time to roll away the reproach it was time because you notice the scene that we're in that the Israelites had just crossed over the river they crossed over in the promised land and they were leaving all of Egypt behind them because you can't pass through death and carry things with you come on somebody you can't pass through death and carry things with you so Joshua this was a sign unto them to raise up Stones as a memorial that we pass through these Waters that when there raises up a generation that says that that that's her days gone by bring them back to these Stones bring them back to this moment bring them back to this time but Joshua had to go further because the word of the Lord said unto him take your sharp knives and circumcised those that had not been circumcised so he raising up a generation he's raising up a generation that was not a part that was not a part of the old generation but notice when they passed through the waters when they walked through and they crossed over notice what it was he was literally rolling away the reproach of Egypt he was rolling away their shame he was rolling away their bondage of their past when the old generation wouldn't commit to the message God was raising up somebody that would commit to the message what did he do he literally rode away the reproach of Egypt so let me say this to you the reproach of Egypt is not on you no more the reproach of sin is not on you no more the reproach of slavery is not on you no more the reproach of Oppression is not on you no more the reproach of idolatry is not on you no more the reproach of the bondage to sin is not on you no more what is it it's somebody that's raising up a new generation that is fully going to manifest what is laying there what Abraham saw I know we're in spiritual warfare but let's fight tonight when when when the rest of the generation would not rise up and Conquer there was going to be somebody that would fully inherit that would fully possess the Bible said that the old generation them old Warriors or the men of War they were consumed because they would not obey the voice of the Lord L and the Bible said that God would not even show them the land but he raised up their children in their stad now notice God's got a word that is going to be fulfilled is that right he's got a word that's going to be fulfilled and the Bible said in Isaiah chapter 55 and I believe it's verse 11 that my word will not return unto me void but it will accomplish that which I pleas it to do so God's got a word for this generation for them to raise up under it but there was old Warriors that would not fully commit to the message so God was going to raise up a generation let me make this very clear the word was going to be fulfilled it didn't matter who was against it it didn't matter how many critics rose up and said it wasn't right he was going to fulfill that commission or or what the word of the Lord was saying for the vision of the hour let me break the stigma right here it's ain't doing away with old people in the message it's ain't doing away in just lifting up our young kids and trying to put the emphasis on them and just saying it's for the older people they have no part in it no more that's absolutely contrary to scripture it's not absolute that's not it at all but what this is recognizing is that you're under a new commission you can't live back there you can't live back there you're under a new Commission come on somebody they a this ain't talking about just the 20 years old and down this ain't just talking about the 40 years old and down this is talking about you as a body of Jesus Christ no matter how old you are you can do your best miracles in your old age under this commission it's a Joshua commission and it's time to possess the vision where others denied the faith you pray pressed on when others did not fully follow the message you pressed the battle when others would not follow Joshua you stood right in line congratulations congratulations you made it over the rest of them heathens the rest of them people that didn't want anything to do with this message look at where you're standing at congratulations to you shake your neighbor's hand slap

he told Joshua you this day this day I have rolled away your reproach I've rolled away your reproach man feels good don't it because you can't carry over the world into this land okay we become very very transparent right here you can't carry Le osia over into our New Jerusalem come on somebody you can't carry your habits over into the land of the Holy Ghost you can't carry over your sin and expect to be an overcomer in this land of the message of the hour you can't carry it over here and have full benefits in the land notice what brother random said and think of man's filter he said' when you come into this world you were born in sin he said you didn't even come here with a fighting chance he said you were born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies he said within your own Spirit the desire to sin a lover of sin because you were born in sin you didn't have a chance he said but down inside of you somewhere here you come there was something in there that begin to draw he said if you know he said it was something that told you there was a god somewhere and you read his word then you took the church then you took to the church you took their ideas when you was told better than you never you never used to have a you never used a thinking man's filter he said but when you use God's filter right which is a thinking man's filter because all the other filters pass away he said but mine shall not and when you take God's filter and draw your life your desires he said if you draw your desires through God's filter a thinking man's fil he said there's nothing left but the Holy Ghost there's nothing left but the Holy Ghost let me say this the only thing that can pass through the the thinking man's filter is the word he said and when you draw your desires through God's filter there's nothing left but the Holy Ghost he said now if you want the evidence of the Holy Ghost there it is people want to ask you what's brother Andrew's stance on the evidence of the Holy Ghost I'll tell you exactly what it is right here if you can draw your desires of Le osia through your experience and still say that you're a Christian you've got the wrong filter but if you've got the right desire and you've got everything align right and the only thing that can pass through that filter is the word of God that's the evidence the evidence is not speaking in tongues the evidence I'm going break a spirit right here the evidence is being able to say Amen to every word of God I don't care if you can scream in tongues crow in tongues that goes with it but the evidence of the Holy Ghost is being able to yourself and come into full obedience to the Token [Applause] message Hallelujah that's it when that soul of yours will line with the word of God in every respect it shows that you draw your life through a thinking man's filter it's God's filter now we we now we look all the way back in their Journey it was faith that led them out of Egypt it was faith that applied the blood to the door it was faith that led them out and it was faith that was going to lead them in notice what the Bible said in Romans 4:11 and heed speaking of Abraham that he received the sign of circumcision a seal of the righteousness of Faith which he had yet being uncircumcised notice his faith he had yet been uncircumcised that he might be the father of all them that believe that a shut how to such illegalism down on't it though they be not circumcised that righteousness might be imputed under them also verse 13 for the promise that he should be the heir of the world was not to Abraham or to his seed through the law but through the righteousness of Faith through the righteousness of Faith was all of this granted it was Mercy to you and God extends Mercy to who he wants to extend Mercy is that right you remember when brother Ram was sitting there and the Lord speaks to him while he's up there hunting said the he tells him be careful tells him be careful he said Satan's got a trap for you out there he didn't know what it was but he come back there he come back there and started preaching that meeting started preaching that meeting and and he said all of a sudden he said he said there was two people out there trying to act like he said they was out there and he said they was making love in the congregation and he said he said he he said there they were and he said he said they in the spirit of the Lord begin to say to me there it is there's that trap there notice brother random said that the whole entire congregation begin to hush that there begin to begin a holy hush and the spirit of the Lord told him said they're in your hand do with them what you [Music] want and he said I forgive you he said because he knew what was coming he knew what was coming he said he so he hadn't he he had to see what I would say about it do you recognize that God is the god that extends Mercy to whom he wants to extend Mercy Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated all Israel is not Israel so just because they look the part does not make them the part but what determines the part is the Jean seed of God oh blessed be the name of the Lord to think that right here in this room it's the same power it's the same power that is operating all of this room that Benjamin Franklin grabbed a hold of when he's out there on that stormy night he's out there with a kite in his hand got a key down at the end of it running down into a bottle it's right here in the room it's right here in the room brother Randall but he couldn't fully tap into it but it took a man by the name of Thomas Edison that was led that was led and anointed for the hour that he was living in and he tried night after night took wire after wire 10 thousands after 10 thousands of times people made fun of him they scoffed at him but it called him crazy but it just kept on going because he believed that what Benjamin Franklin could stand out there and scream I've got it he believed that he could harness that power Thomas Edison said he said I didn't find 10,000 10,000 ways to fail he said I found 10,000 ways to show me how I could succeed let me tell you you may have failed you may have failed it may have been 10 thousand times but it just showed you where you could succeed at that power that's given you overcoming power has been here all that time to think that the power that is operating this building has been here ever since Adam walked on the Earth but it took somebody blessed be the name of the Lord somebody to harness it and control it what did Edison do he simply moved brother sanon in the law of electricity and he made and found a current that power that fell on the day of Pentecost had always been here but Peter stood up there and he found that Holy power that was on the inside of Jesus now that same power that fell up there in the upper room it's here come on somebody if it did healings in Jesus day then it'll produce healings right now now that same power what do you shook up about that same pow is in the room it doesn't matter whether you see it whether you feel it whether whether you feel a condition of rolling of of your chills running down your body it's in the room it's in the room it's in the room let me say it like this your prodal that do not look like they are coming the power to release them the key of it is Faith and it's in the room the key to unlock the Rapture is your faith and it's in the room something is coming unhinged in here something's breaking something's breaking because you choose you choose which side you want to be on you either choose Faith or you choose out and we recognize that where we're living at is the hour of the overcomer notice notice that God didn't just raise us up to see if he could do it he had a purpose in doing it is that right man didn't create the automobile just to see if he could do it he had a purpose in doing it and God didn't just simply make you to see if he could do it he had a purpose in doing it and notice when when when when when Isaiah or excuse me Zachariah when he sitting there in Zechariah Chapter 4 and you can see there that the Lord begins to show Zachariah all the way into our age he begins to show him the seven Church ages he begins to show him the olive branches and all of those things and he begins to speak to him in Zechariah 4 and verse 6 if you don't mind I'm might turn around cuz I ain't got glasses he back here then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto zeruel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of H verse 7 Where Art Thou oh great Mountain who who art thou oh great Mountain before Zer Rubble Thou shalt become a plain and he shall bring forth The Headstone thereof shouting crying shoutings crying Grace Grace Uno it what did William brandham say in this generation it's a message of Grace but notice notice the same one that is standing there in Zachariah chap CH 4 when you look over into Revelations chapter 1 when you look into Revelations chapter 1 and you begin to see there I'm just going to quote it well you begin to see one that is standing in the midst maybe verse 13 He begin to stand there in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks there standing one like unto the son of man what is it it's the same one in Zechariah Chapter for it's not by might it's not by power that same power that same power is standing right here hallelujah he didn't leave you in 1965 that same power that is going to press you through get you in the Rapture make you an overcomer give you a body change that Holy power that AR ra you out of the Grave one of these days that Holy power is in the room and he's walking in the midst of the church Hallelujah notice notice what the seven when brother Bram starts taking the seals notice he steps into he goes into full operation of the Elijah Ministry no notice what he starts laying out there in the seals he starts saying that the opening and the breaking of those seals that the ministry of the seventh angel is the mysteries of God so it's literally his ministry to break the seals that'll release you from every Hound of hell so you're not just under some man Ministry you're feeding on the son of man so you recognize what superpower that you're under you're not under you're not under a Creed you're not under denomination you're not under organization you're under an anointing you're under an anointing of the age it's an eagle anointing and it's literally this messenger this seventh angel his ministry is the mysteries of God what makes you so different brother Andrew this power this spirit this message you cannot separate the message from the messenger and you can't separate me from the message what did it do it literally rolled the reproach off of you now a lot of you been born right here you've been right Born right here in the message you've been you've been raised in diapers right here that's scary thought that when I was getting married Carly was a baby pretty much a baby in this church but to think about there's a lot of other babies here too she was in my eyesight but to think about it that a lot of you come out of denominations maybe maybe you didn't as a family but maybe your forefathers or your grandfathers they came out of denominations but to think where where the message has literally has literally roded that reproach off of you what do you mean brother Andrew you find somebody that was that was brought up in the Catholic Church they literally the message literally rolled that ideology off of them you take somebody that was raised in a church of Christ or a Church of God where they was quiet as as a church mouse on Sunday morning they didn't believe in anything they didn't believe in anything like this this message literally rolled that off of them what did it do he gave you a new identity now let me come back to you that were raised in the message you had to have an experience for yourself just because you sat here and under a great ministry does not change does not say that you don't need the reproach Road off of you you need it more than a lot of people because people that are raised in the message sometimes get a higher thinking about themselves and think that they're okay because they're under the message of the hour sometimes them message so-called Believers are more dangerous than a Pentecostal or a Church of Christ out there because they got a spirit a religious spirit on them that is harder to break than a prostitute on a street felt that oh yeah I know what I'm talking about and I'm getting into some Waters here but I want you to know that this message literally rolled the reproach off of you because just like it came to Ruth just like when she was a moabitas and had the identity of a moabit what did this Mighty Man of wealth do he rode the very title of a moabit off of her and placed her as the ancestor of [Applause] David what did it do when the Mighty Man of wealth kicked off his shoe what happened up there on the cross when Christ kicked off the rags of righteousness and said I'll die for them I'll go to the cross for them you couldn't pay your sin you couldn't get yourself out of a mud hole but God rich in Mercy said I'll take the pain for them Hallelujah notice in this message of Grace he said I want you to notice he never said that he shall bring forth a Cornerstone that he shall bring forth a headstone he said we know that the scripture says that Jesus is the Chief Cornerstone and he's also the headstone he said now but if we think for a minute he said that the seven Church age messenger was to restore the faith of the children back to the fathers he said in other words and now catch this he said in other words rebuild the church again under the power of the spirit you catch it that the seven Church messenger was to restore the faith of the children back to the fathers in other words rebuild the church again under the power of the spirit not by power not by might but by my spirit sayith the Lord not by organization not by denomination but by the holy spirit of God will bring forth a church in the last days notice what the message did it broke the denominational barriers that held you back from being who you were meant to be because if you plant a denominational seed you get denominational tears you get unbelief in your mix but notice the hour that you're living in this is restoration this is the restoration of the Bride tree that you're not a part Hallelujah the canker worm made it down the P worm ate it down the Locust ate it down but in the last days my people will never be ashamed and I will restore thus saith the Lord hallelujah that's what Peter got a hold of he had an identity he had an identity as a cussing preacher denying the Christ three times but when he got up there on the day of Pentecost he grabbed a hold of something and said this is that that was prophesied by the prophet Joel he was no longer identified no more as a cusser but he was identified as a message preacher that's what John said when the voice came to him in Revelations 22 and 10 he said and he saith unto me seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book for the time is at hand what was it don't seal it up I got a people that need this I got a people that's living in the hour roll it away them denominations will never get you out of here there's good people out there I got good friends out there but that denomination that organization that man's spirit will never put you in a rapture that's why when John is standing there and he catches the Revelation said seal it up not don't seal it up there's a people that's coming in the last day that will receive the prophecy of this book they will be the manifestation of Revelations 10 they will the spirit of Prophecy has returned to the Church of the Living God now when Jesus I'm going to turn real quick here when Jesus comes and he spent some he spent some time with his family he spent some time with his friends he he showed them he brings the children unto himself he heals a leper he does many miracles but when Jesus walks into his hometown and they ask him to read of the book what's he doing he's moving into full operation of his ministry he was not just a friend no more come on somebody he was not just a childhood friend no more he was no longer just the boy that was raised right here he was no longer the man that knew the Torah he was not just that man no more but he was taken on a role and you go to read in Luke chapter 4 and you could see that when he takes his turn that the that the book is delivered of him and he takes a book and the Bible said that when he had opened the book when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written go ahead says or brother whoever's running it that the spirit the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach to the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and the recovering of the sight to the blind to set at Liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord to think the position that he's taken they waited 49 years and 11 months and all the way through they waited for that Jubilee trumpet but Jesus is signaling to all of the Jews that your hour of freedom is here hallelujah your hour of freedom is here and when he had finished the reading he closed a book and sat down and all eyes are on him but he left something for this day brother Chris all eyes are on him and he said this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears the one that they was raised up with the one that they knew was now fully taken in operation the ministry of the Messiah the one that Moses thought of was now here just like when Abraham saw them 800 years before when he saw his seed fully operating in the land of Canaan they were walking in the vision they couldn't handle this brother Doug these were some religious dudes these were the so-called so-called message Elite of the day take it back it's blasphemy what you've said and they take him out they take him out said if you don't repent of this you know what the law says about it you know what the law says about it they take him out to the edge of a cliff you take him out to an edge of cliff and they're going to cast him out you can imagine where he's at he's got his back against death he's got his back against death he's got his back against everything that is going to kill his ministry but his ministry was far from over they were pushing him to a spot but the Bible said that he simply walked through the midst of them because his time was not up yet he simply let me say this to you we may have had our back pushed against the wall for Gospel Lighthouse the message of the hour may have had its back pushed against the wall but it ain't our time yet but when every son has come to full maturity sister Katie when they come to full maturity push us where you want to say what you want to about us let the Knights of Columbus do what they going to do but we're going to be gone they will hunt out those that took on the name of Jesus but we will be here we will hallelujah hallelujah what's happening little bride he's rolling rolling he's rolling away your reproach you may have been raised one way you may have thought the message was this but God is rolling away your reproach got so many people got their ideas of what the message is God's rolling that away your ideas of what the message is will not work what's happening God is literally rolling away all the ideas that William brandom's got to come back and return to fulfill of killing out a brown bear he's rolling that away he's literally rolling away the return he's literally rolling away every doctrine of men that think they've got this thing figured out I don't know where that come from but God is literally rolling away all of your ideas of what you think the message is because your idea will never put you in the m in a Rapture come on somebody if it was good enough if your idea was good enough then why didn't he take you with you had first have the idea help me Lord to get out of this let me go on I'm like brother Michael I forgot to set a timer and don't know what time it is same spirit's on me this weekend spoken word is the Original Seed God has taken the elect out of that Pentecostal church that hybrid pulling it out and finishing up that word he said it's got to be so close CL until the word itself will blend with this word there comes a headstone crying Grace Grace Amazing Grace The Headstone he said here you are like this see here on there how many wide down here and it keeps getting closer closer and closer the ministry he said here's Luther justification Here Comes Wesley that's Sanctified mons he said Here Comes Pentecostal the restoration of gifts he said but God is taking from there and honing out a bunch to make a Ministry just like that word there because it's got to fit with the word there's the bride take her up don't you see where we are it's a headstone and the body is operating under the same Revelation that the countdown hour is here you remember when William Brandon was on that plane he's on that plane and he gets off down there in Memphis the storm raises up and he shuts him down there in Memphis he goes ship him letters off and he starts taking a walk and he got singing that Pentecostal song I'm one of them I'm one of them starts going down through air and the spirit of the Lord leads them all the way down there I believe it's I believe it's been uh tagged to seven miles that he walked that day walked all the way down there in the hood and he gets down there and there's a woman down there and a't Jami down there he said Parson he said how'd you know I was a Parson you know all the story and there see there's that boy laying up there in that house got that got that veneral disease he's got that social disease upon him he said I've been in King's palaces I've been in King's palaces he said but I've never been in a place like this before he said this woman knew how to pray and he said I'll begin to pray and she begin to pray and all of a sudden the voice said Mama it's beginning to get light in here it's beginning to get light in here and he ran into that boy several months later said sir do you remember me he said no I don't remember you said I was that boy that you prayed for said I ain't know I ain't just healed but I'm a Christian now don't you see the hour that we're living in we're living in the third pole Ministry where God has a people that can call a storm into a existence to bring a word by their way to release Sons and Daughters of God no matter the situation that they're in no matter the condition Shannon he might be in a jail sale he might be locked up but this message has found its way yeah you're not under you're not under under the reproach a bondage of sin no more you have been rode away you have looked into the perfect law the law of Liberty that's the hour that we're living in I ain't just healed mama I was a Christian too that's the hour that we're living in the manifestation of Sons of men Rising under their full Authority as adopted Sons and Daughters of God hallelujah well we might as well call for our sons they're ours we might as well call for our daughters we might as well call for [Applause] healings might as well Hallelujah hallu Christ didn't just come here to bring priest he come here to bring a sword Christ didn't come here just to pet the devil around he didn't come here just so you can live in your filthiness and stay in your filthiness he literally came here to destroy the works of the enemy you go on down in that message you'll find that William brandham said that the body is to do the same thing to destroy the works of the enemy there'll be a church of the word they'll be born of the word there'll be a virgin born from the word that you are literally here to destroy the works of the enemy now the enemy come to kill steal and destroy but Jesus said I come to give life and life more abundantly now you take this for what you will but I had this quota in my message for today I wake up this morning I send it to my family and a brother sends me this same quote by the church email and I I about I held myself together all day brother Prophet said he said I might could stop here he said if I had time to give you just a little tip he said sometimes you might be sitting out there with cancer or he said you might be sitting out there with a disease he said you think why me being a Christian would be in this way why would I be sitting like this if I'm a Christian sometimes God lets the things get so dark that you can't see up around or anywhere else and there he comes and makes a way through it for you that you might say this day this scripture is being fulfilled that he promised to do he said he let the Hebrew children walk right in the fiery furnace and said that our God is able to Deliver Us from this fire in the furnace he said but nevertheless we'll not bow down to your image he said when they walked out there he said no smell of the Furnace rather upon them he said they could have said this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears that's exactly what Joshua stood out there when he grabbed a hold of it and the rest of them 10 spies their heart failed but he looked out there and said this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears Hallelujah he said the Pentecostal church is in a lay osing condition he said oh they still jumping holler and carrying on when the music is beating he said but when the Music Stops a beating or the beat neck music stop or some of them play and calling it Christianity and he said whenever that stops all the glory is gone come on Shout with me real quick he said but if it's real praise of God there isn't enough whistles enough power in the world to stop it he said when it really comes from God it don't take music to beat it up it takes the spirit of God to come down on it he said that's what does it that's what I've taught you here that's what this message T to you it ain't the music while you're shouting it ain't the it ain't the music I know we Shout with it but I can shout without it [Applause] too this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears well it's just a bunch of work up down there Full Gospel Lighthouse I got a word for you come and see they ain't one Li a music playing right now when you preach a message the bride will rise through her feet come on somebody I'll dance with you all the way David 17 miles backwards but what really Thrills my heart [ __ ] is when I see the word of God doing what it said that it would do in this generation that'll make you shout it'll make you scream it'll make you dance it'll make you holler it'll make you speak in tongues when you see yourself we had a prominent man in the message that come to this church said I just come here to see if it's real or not because a lot of people see things on the internet and don't have a clue because they ain't never been in a situation because churches don't believe in preaching the message in its entirety not every now every service ain't going to be like that shouting and screaming and speaking in tongues and dancing all over the building I'm the first to recognize it I'm the first to identify it but I believe you can have it I believe you can have it in every single service if you set the right kind of atmosphere I believe that you can create such an atmosphere that sons that are away from God can literally be pulled by the atmos spere that you create in this building well it ain't just prominent people in the message it's just want to come and see it it's our prodal out there that don't know anything that's going on but there's somebody in this room that has created a place where the king of glory has felt welcome to come now y'all y'all hang with me I'm going I'm going to go through some lard but we going to get to some real meat here because we are coming to an hour where where Joshua that we're here under a Joshua commission where we are rolling away where every one of us have Egypt on us we all have our Egypt we all have past sins we all have mistakes we all have failures that haunt us and keep us from fully experiencing God's blessings things that will literally Rob the power away from the church but that ain't your identity God is able say it with me God is able to roll away my reproach he's able to forgive my sins he's able to roll away and cleanse me of all my unrighteousness and he's able if he could get Mary Magdalene when she was a woman that was ostracized from the economy of God and give her a new identity that she's the first one to see him on Resurrection [Applause] morning come on somebody I don't need your church anity I don't need your so-called tradition I don't need your religiosity just give me the power of the message it'll roll away your reproach it matters where you're standing at it literally matters where you're sitting at notice when you go I'm going to lay some things and I'm moving on from here but gilgal literally means to roll it means to roll away it means to roll around on the ground until you roll everything off of you brother Andrew I really don't understand understand what's going on here we taking the natural you take it a natural let's go back a few thousand years and you take this circumcision it's painful they were literally rolling on the ground trying to get rolling on the ground until they literally rolled the reproach right off of them what happened where'd you get that name Holy Rollers from you literally rode the reproach right off of you what happened with Hannah when she was out there when others mocked her when they when her when her husband's other wife was mocking her because she didn't have a child and she was reproached amongst her own Community when she got up there and she got herself s so drunk under prayer that the priest thought she was drunk on strong drink but she'd just come under the atmosphere of prayer that she literally got into such a spot that prayer rolled her reproach off of her okay okay if I share this we're here 3 weeks ago 3 weeks ago we had one of them meetings and our pastor stood right here and just the word of the Lord came to him said it's a blockage I said it to sister Anna it's a blockage it's all it is it's a blockage you can get you can hear the story from her it's a blockage didn't know what the word was didn't know exactly what it was about I'm telling this story because some people think when you tell your own stories that you're trying to lift yourself up so I'm telling his story so he ain't lifting your up I'm lifting him up and I'm not lifting him up I'm lifting the god inside of him up hey you're his son though I'm bigger than that I'm a son of almighty God before I was Ron Spencer son but the word said it's just a blockage she goes to the doctors and it's a blockage that is that has been preventing life from happening but because of science doctors literally rode the massage Rod the blockage right out of the way what is this message doing there's been a blockage in your life there was sin in your life but the message roll the blockage out of your life it didn't just happen by happen stance that brother Tom Ray stood here said it four times now let life come let life come the blockage is gone let life come roll it away David had reproach on his life he had mistakes on his life but as when the Bible said in Psalms 51 create in me a clean heart and renew within me a right Spirit oh God roll the reproach away so I'm telling you church you can live in full victory God still got a word for you God still got a man of God that still believes that God can give a word in an hour of your desire that you can live in the freedom of Gil God that you can live in Freedom and the Victory of Gil God to let your past go let the past be the past and embrace life embrace it embrace it because God is literally raising a generation up of tower record we don't care how we get in the room do we sister Tracy we don't care if we got to tear the roof off long as I'm in the room all I want to do is be in the room when he moves and when he moves I ain't leaving well he's here so come and see come on somebody he's raising up a generation that is literally moving in to the full benefits and the full promise we don't need some promis keeper convention to keep us true we don't need some convention of men to tell us not to get on the internet and look at dirty sites we don't need somebody to hold our hands to tell us not to go down to the drugs tell us not to go down to the ABC store we don't have to have somebody to hold us and pamper us around we don't need some promisee keeper convention we got a power power that's strong enough and it's not by might and it's not by power but it's by my spirit sayith the Lord we got that kind of a word that will destroy the works of the enemy because William Brandon when he left here he left a message full of power but then the hour has come to roll away the approach well we got the word brother Andrew we don't need Miracles no more we got the word brother Andrew we're in the land of the Holy Ghost we're in the land of the message we done come to our maturity we don't need shout no more we don't need speaking in tongues no more we don't need Miracles we don't need deliverances as brother Ron said some of you do but the message come to roll away the ideas well we don't need those things no more we got the full word here so all we got to do is quote the quote and live by the letter and produce a dead generation of believers you know I think it's amazing it's spiritual religion so-called religious spirits and they can shout you down when you can sit there and you can preach and say well we don't need we're not just looking after your emotion we're not just looking after your shouting oh man they can amen you right there we don't need a mo we don't need just emotion they can amen right there they can amen you we don't just need shouting we don't just need speaking in tongues we don't just need gifts of the Spirit they can amen you right there but when it comes by their way and it really gets down on them and they sit there and say well it's too loud in the house of God and I tell you I I just you know it's not just my style and that's not just my way of receiving things and they can clamp the spirit down well we don't need them type of things no more them was days gone by back in the days back in the days of Gone by by here we are here we are in the land of full maturity brother Andrew we don't need them type of things no more well I can tell by your spirit that you are not a Bible believing kind of spirit it's amazing you can literally feel that spirit and it will clamp a service down down you can go to preaching on the baptism of the Holy Ghost and receiving it that is not just a motion that is not just a workup and man they're right with you all the way but you go over and say but you watch as soon as you get the Holy Ghost it'll make you shout it'll make you liberate it'll make you get to a spot that you're not ashamed because I believe what the prophet said that if you say you got the Holy Ghost and says sh but don't tell nobody then you really ain't got it I done got that spirit and it ain't a person it's a spirit it's a spirit that does it it's a spirit that gets in there and said we don't need them Miracles we don't need them things we done gone up into higher Places come on up here let me tell you what is this message it's a message of Grace of shoutings of Grace Grace well brother Andrew don't you know we're under a Joshua commission and they was in Moses day that he had the Miracles but if you will study out your Bible in Joshua chapter 3 that the Bible said that this day I will begin to magnify you Joshua amongst all the sight of the children of Israel oh yeah so let me say like this your ideas and your blockages will never stop our miracles from coming Joshua you ain't seen nothing yet there's miracles on top of Miracles there's cancers leaving there's babies coming there's prodal returning I'm not trying to push this down your throat I'm trly simply trying to say that this is the land of the message that you're living in it's a land flowing with milk and honey and every single time you see a devil rise up and try to scare you away from it remember it's nothing but a devil because the land is yours whether Satan lies the fruit is yours whether Giants show up your Future's clear when walls show up this is rolling the reproach of slavery off of you you don't have to live that kind of way you don't have to live under that kind of mindset you don't have to live under that kind of scrutiny if a spirit is keeping you from fully releasing yourself to be who you are my I knew we was in for spiritual warfare but we're really in it ain't but this is rolling away that you're not a slave you're not under depression you're not under legalism you're not under oppression you're not under bondage you're in perfect Liberty because when Paul said in 2 Corinthians and three he said that when it is turned to the Lord the veil will be taken away when what is turn sister herler when what is turned when the heart is turned then the veil will be taken away what is the message brother it's Malachi 4 it's the Turning of our hearts back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers and the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty satan in the name of Jesus Christ I bind you and all of your power you have no legal Authority amongst the Church of the Living God you cannot bind us because we've been set free you cannot hinder us because we've got an open Vision you cannot make us bow to you because we've received the word hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord somebody give him praise that's where you're living at you're not living in bondage you're not living in fear when Jesus Takes a woman caught in ad doar Tre he looks on her and said woman thou art loosed you're loose from your bondage you're loose from your sin you're loose from your pride you're Loos from your condemnation you're Loos from idolatry you're Loos you're Loos hallelujah hallelujah and you're loose from legalism what is it we're in end time we're in end time and I know we're in to Showdown right here but don't worry don't worry God the almighty God that stood up when Abram was 99 years old and he said I am the almighty don't you worry about The Showdown that we're in right now God is the all powerful one he is elad and when you don't think you got enough strength he is your strength all you got to do is pull on him and he'll give forth power out of el Shi Abraham nursed a new body what are you doing in this hour you are nursing the very strength for your body change right out of this message he is the almighty God what did he give him what did he give him he gave him the Seal of circumcision that it was a token between him and him it's of righteousness of faith imagine brother Chester all them years your name's High father but where's your son at your name's High father but where's all your children at but God came to him and changed his name to Abraham what did he do he put a part of himself in there so that the promise could be fulfilled you'll never roll away your reproach on your own I'm done I'm way past done musicians could come but you'll never roll away your reproach on your own but when he imparts and infuses himself on the inside of you he literally imparted life to you I don't I don't believe that we should Miss where we're at right here we're in a very special spot Visions breaking Miracles happening the Supernatural is right here Sarah you're never going to do this on your own but when you receive this Revelation he's literally rolling Sarah's reproach off of her she couldn't do it she done tried every other way to do it she tried producing some man-made religion she tried doing it on her own that's why you got to have the Holy Ghost you can't do it on your own you can't live out your life through somebody else you can't have a haard experience you got to have an experience with Elohim the almighty God and when you do [Applause] he literally Rose he literally Rose he literally Rose he rose a reproach of your Humanity what is it when you receive an abstract idle deed I'm sorry what is it that everything that was struck against you it's over it's over your mama was a prostitute but it's over your daddy was a drunker but it's over it's over sing Matthew I was just in child when i s my SE av's [Music] lead I
