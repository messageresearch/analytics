[20:00] me. Turn me
[20:03] aside. Said there's no need for you to
[20:06] go
[20:07] on. No need to
[20:11] try. Even if there was a rapture, you
[20:16] never make it
[20:18] in. I just say, Satan, that just proves
[20:23] you're a liar again. I'm going to keep
[20:27] pressing
[20:29] on on and on and on.
[20:35] [Music]
[20:40] I'm going to keep pressing
[20:43] on to the higher
[20:47] calling of my
[20:50] Lord. How many is he whispering to this
[20:56] week? Satan tries to stop
[20:59] me. Turn me aside.
[21:03] [Music]
[21:04] said, "There's no need for you to go
[21:07] on, no need to
[21:10] [Music]
[21:11] try. Even if there was a rapture, you
[21:16] never make it in." Sing it to him loud.
[21:21] [Music]
[21:25] We're going to keep pressing
[21:30] on and on and on.
[21:35] [Music]
[21:40] I'm going to keep pressing
[21:44] on to the higher
[21:47] calling of my
[21:50] [Music]
[21:52] Lord.
[21:54] Amen. That's what we do. We press on cuz
[21:59] we got one backing us up. Amen. And
[22:02] ain't we glad of that. How can we be
[22:04] defeated when we got an undefeated
[22:06] champion who's behind us?
[22:09] And if he's taking his time to talk to
[22:10] you, he's lying to begin with.
[22:14] Amen. Let's go to these prayer requests
[22:17] this evening. Dear church family, please
[22:20] keep Jason in your prayers. He's in a
[22:22] lot of pain from the accident he had
[22:24] yesterday. Thank you, Sister Jamie
[22:27] Turner. We want to pray for the family
[22:30] of Eli Britain. He passed away in a car
[22:33] accident this week. He was only 20 years
[22:36] old. We want to keep that family there
[22:40] in our
[22:41] prayers. Want to remember those youth
[22:43] group meetings and our youth down there.
[22:45] Brother Donnie Reagan's that the Lord
[22:47] would just move and have his way there.
[22:50] Want to be remembering our pastor,
[22:51] Brother Ron. My sister, she's in a lot
[22:54] of pain this evening.
[22:56] my sister Tanya. I pray that the Lord
[22:59] would go by her way and touch her and
[23:00] help
[23:01] her. Maybe you have an unspoken need
[23:04] here today on your heart. You'd like to
[23:05] lift up your hand. The Lord knows every
[23:07] one of them. Brother William, would you
[23:10] take these prayers before throne of the
[23:13] [Music]
[23:15] Lord? Amen. Let's bow our heads in our
[23:18] hearts. Dear gracious heavenly father,
[23:21] Lord God, we come humbly before you in
[23:22] prayer. Lord Jesus, we just want to tell
[23:25] you how much we love you, Lord. And we
[23:27] just want to give you all the honor,
[23:28] praise, and glory due unto your name.
[23:31] Lord, you're so worthy and you're so
[23:33] faithful and you're all powerful, Lord
[23:36] Jesus. Lord, nothing is impossible with
[23:39] you. And you can do all
[23:41] things, Lord. There's only one single
[23:44] thing that you can't do, and that's you
[23:46] cannot lie. Lord, once the word is
[23:49] spoken and once the promise is made,
[23:51] Lord, it can never return void. It's got
[23:54] to come to
[23:55] pass, Lord Jesus. We just pray that as
[23:58] we bow our heads and our hearts, Lord,
[24:00] we just want to humble ourselves and ask
[24:02] that you forgive us, Lord. Forgive us,
[24:04] Lord, of every wrong word, every wrong
[24:06] thought or action that we might have
[24:08] made, Lord. Just forgive us, Lord. We
[24:10] just need your mercies, Lord. We need
[24:12] the blood of Jesus Christ to cover us,
[24:15] Lord. Lord, that blood is so powerful,
[24:17] and that blood can never lose its power,
[24:19] Lord. We we need it, Lord, to forgive
[24:22] us. We need it for sanctification, Lord.
[24:24] We depend on that blood for our healing,
[24:26] Lord Jesus. Lord, you said that in your
[24:29] word, Isaiah has seen you, Father, just
[24:31] taking stripes for our healing. He would
[24:34] use the words that you were wounded for
[24:36] our
[24:38] transgressions. You were bruised for our
[24:41] iniquities. The chastisement of our
[24:43] peace was upon you, and by your stripes,
[24:47] we are healed.
[24:49] Lord, the word has been spoken and is
[24:51] now in our laps. What will we do with
[24:54] it? Lord, will we believe it and receive
[24:56] what we
[24:57] ask? Lord, that's all you ask, Lord, is
[25:00] do you believe? Do you have faith? And
[25:03] Lord, we just pray that if there's any
[25:05] unbelief in our hearts that you forgive
[25:07] us, Lord, every word is yay and amen.
[25:09] And we want to confess with our mouth
[25:12] that we believe the whole word of God.
[25:15] Everything that you've said, we believe
[25:16] and we love with all of our
[25:18] hearts. You promised us a body change,
[25:21] Lord, and we believe it. You promised us
[25:23] healing and we believe it. You promised
[25:26] us comfort and we believe it. And Lord,
[25:29] there's prayer requests, oh God, that
[25:30] was spoken, oh Lord God, this evening,
[25:33] Lord, where there's families that need
[25:35] comfort. Lord, be the great comforter to
[25:37] them. Lord, you're everything to us. Be
[25:40] a comforter to them, Lord. Be a healer
[25:43] to those that are
[25:45] sick. Heal the brokenhearted, Lord.
[25:48] Encourage the weak. May as a word as it
[25:51] comes forth, Lord, may it give strength.
[25:53] Oh God, as the scripture says, may the
[25:55] weak say that I am strong. Regardless of
[25:59] what the enemy says, regardless of how
[26:01] they feel, may they confess that they're
[26:03] strong, not in their own strength, but
[26:05] by the virtue of the Holy Ghost. Have
[26:08] your way in the service. Lord, bless
[26:09] brother Andrew as he brings forth the
[26:11] word. Use your servant in a mighty way,
[26:13] Lord. May your spirit come behind the
[26:15] word and bless us, Father. We pray. We
[26:18] love you. We thank you. We know you will
[26:21] because you're so faithful. We love you
[26:22] now. And commit the service into your
[26:24] hands in Jesus Christ's name.
[26:29] Amen. As we prepare to give the
[26:33] evening's offering, maybe sister Emily
[26:35] Huff come a song for us. Sister Anna.

[30:20] first. All my desires reverse.
[30:25] to keep the first thing
[30:33] first. To keep the first thing
[30:43] first. First thing first, seek your
[30:47] will, not my own. Surrender all my words
[30:54] to
[30:56] you. Keep the first thing
[31:01] first to leave your truth. Walk your
[31:06] ways. Set my eyes. Lord, I'll fix my
[31:11] face on
[31:14] you. All my desires

[45:24] strange, strangely
[45:28] dear in the
[45:31] life of his
[45:34] glory and
[45:37] grace. Hallelujah.
[45:40] Aren't you thankful for a place that you
[45:42] can turn to in this world that we're
[45:44] living in? Amen. What an honor it is to
[45:48] be in the house of the Lord this
[45:49] evening. Amen. As as many of you have
[45:52] seen in the in the church message
[45:54] already this week that uh we're going to
[45:56] be having a baptism tomorrow after uh
[45:59] after service tomorrow and brother
[46:01] Jordan Robinson is is going to be
[46:04] rebaptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[46:06] Christ. He was he was baptized as a
[46:08] young young child, but he's seen the
[46:10] work of the Lord working in his life and
[46:13] just wants to rededicate his life and
[46:15] Amen. We're certainly thankful for young
[46:17] men that that understand the scriptures
[46:20] and want to put themsel in line with it.
[46:22] Amen. Amen. So, if anybody else would
[46:25] desire to be baptized, you can just make
[46:27] mention to one of the deacons at the
[46:29] back and different things there. Amen.
[46:31] and we want to be remembering the
[46:33] meeting there in uh Johnson City,
[46:35] Tennessee. And that's where a few of our
[46:37] our believers are here tonight. So, we
[46:39] just want to be remembering them that
[46:41] God will bless them in a bless blessed
[46:43] way. Amen. If you have your Bibles this
[46:45] evening, we'd like to u just dive right
[46:48] into the word of the Lord tonight. We'd
[46:50] like to look in Luke chapter 17.
[46:58] Brother Ron just made mention to me that
[47:00] brother Bill Delaney is here. So God
[47:02] richly bless you, our brother Bill. We
[47:04] love you with the love of the Lord.
[47:06] Amen.
[47:07] Amen. That's wonderful. Praise the
[47:11] Lord.
[47:13] Amen. You know, for some people it's
[47:16] just walking through the doors like
[47:17] another day. But for our brother, he's
[47:20] been through a battle. We just we just
[47:21] thank the Lord. This is no small thing.
[47:24] So we just praise the Lord for what he's
[47:26] done for brother Bill and want to
[47:27] continue to lift him up in prayer. Amen.
[47:30] Luke chapter 17 and verse 26 also Mark
[47:34] chapter 16 and then Luke chapter 24 as
[47:39] you're just kind of preparing those
[47:40] things there.
[47:42] Uh the Lord dealt with me on this u this
[47:46] little thought that I'd like to take
[47:47] here tonight and it it it comes from a
[47:50] quote that brother Brandon makes mention
[47:52] and it is the rising of the
[47:56] sun. He he he quotes Jesus in John
[47:59] chapter 14. He says because I live you
[48:01] live also. Speaking to his wife, because
[48:05] I live, you live
[48:07] also. What a resurrection that was. And
[48:11] what a resurrection this is to be
[48:14] quickened from the dead to be made alive
[48:17] in Christ Jesus by God's quickening
[48:20] power. Luke 17 26 and as it was in the
[48:24] days of Noah so shall it be in the days
[48:27] of the son of man. They did eat, they
[48:30] drank, they married wives, they were
[48:33] given in marriage until the day that
[48:35] Noah entered into the ark, and the flood
[48:38] came and destroyed them all. Likewise
[48:42] also, as it is as it was in the days of
[48:45] Lot, they did eat, they drank, they
[48:49] bought, they sold, they planted, they
[48:52] builded. But the same day that Lot went
[48:55] out of Sodom, it rained fire and
[48:57] brimstone from heaven and destroyed them
[49:00] all. Even thus shall it be in the day
[49:04] when the son of man is revealed. Also
[49:08] Markapter 16
[49:18] verse1. And when the Sabbath was passed,
[49:22] Mary Magdalene and the mother of James
[49:25] and Salomi had brought sweet spices that
[49:29] they might come and anoint him. And very
[49:32] early in the morning, the first day of
[49:34] the week, they came unto the suppler at
[49:37] the rising of the
[49:40] sun. Luke chapter 24 and verse one.
[50:01] Now upon the first day of the week, very
[50:04] early in the morning, they came unto the
[50:07] suppler, bringing spices, which they had
[50:11] prepared, and certain others with them.
[50:14] And they found the stone rolled away
[50:16] from the supplr, and they entered in,
[50:20] and found not the body of the Lord
[50:23] Jesus. And it came to pass, as they were
[50:27] much perplexed there, behold, two men
[50:29] stood by them in shining garments, and
[50:32] as they were afraid, and bowed down
[50:34] their faces to the earth, they said unto
[50:36] him, "Why seek ye the living amongst the
[50:40] dead?" And I believe that we could ask
[50:42] those same questions today.
[50:45] Why would we be seeking the living one
[50:47] amongst dead traditions?
[50:50] He is not here but is risen. Remember
[50:54] how he spake unto you when he was yet in
[50:57] Galilee, saying that the son of man must
[50:59] be delivered into the hands of sinful
[51:00] man and be crucified the third day and
[51:04] and the third day rise again. and they
[51:07] remembered his words and returned from
[51:10] the suppler and told all these things
[51:13] unto the 11 and to all the rest. Let's
[51:16] just go to the Lord in prayer. Father,
[51:18] we have come before you tonight. We have
[51:21] consecrated oursel, Lord, one more time
[51:23] in your presence, Lord. And we we
[51:25] sincerely realize, Lord, the moment that
[51:28] we're standing in, Father, you have
[51:30] charged us, Lord, to stand here and to
[51:32] preach the gospel. Now, Father, as long
[51:34] as you are here, that is what we are
[51:36] duty bound to do, Father. And Father, we
[51:38] realize that you have a a bride that
[51:40] you're wanting to make ready, Father, by
[51:43] the robing of this word that has been
[51:46] given to us in this age. And Father,
[51:48] that's what we have come to church to do
[51:50] today, tonight, Lord, is to just to
[51:52] buckle up the armor just a little bit
[51:54] tighter to find some things, Lord Jesus,
[51:57] that you have for this specific hour
[51:58] that we're in. And I pray God that you
[52:01] would take these words, Lord, that I
[52:02] have studied and I realize, Father,
[52:05] Lord, that it might just seem like a
[52:07] Saturday night to some, but to me,
[52:09] Father, I believe that we're in a very
[52:12] special moment, Lord. You have ordained
[52:14] this moment, God. This is not just
[52:16] another time of reading of the
[52:18] scriptures, but I believe, God, that you
[52:21] have something in this word that will
[52:23] literally change the elements in our
[52:25] body, Father. Lord, I believe that just
[52:28] like we have read how that you got up
[52:30] out of the grave. I believe, Father,
[52:32] that one of these mornings that you're
[52:34] going to snatch a bride away, Father,
[52:37] that has been called by your name. And
[52:39] father, we don't want to just we don't
[52:41] want to ask a miss, Father, but we want
[52:44] to ask Lord if there is anything in us,
[52:46] Father, that would make us miss this
[52:49] resurrection, Lord, that would make us
[52:51] miss the rapture, Father, that we would
[52:54] place it under the blood of Jesus
[52:56] Christ, Father. For truly, Lord, we
[52:58] desire to make heaven our home. Now,
[53:00] God, we commit this service unto thine
[53:02] hands for the glory of the kingdom of
[53:05] God. We ask these things in the name of
[53:09] Jesus Christ. May God bless his word.
[53:11] You may be seated here tonight in the
[53:14] presence of the Lord. You begin to watch
[53:17] the events as you begin to look at the
[53:20] the scriptures and you begin to look at
[53:22] the events that begin to transpire
[53:24] before Christ, before his crucifixion,
[53:27] and before his resurrection. You begin
[53:30] to study and find that there in those
[53:33] final moments of Jesus's life, you begin
[53:36] to recognize that he begins to operate
[53:38] in a realm where he is going to move
[53:41] into where he is fulfilling prophecy in
[53:45] in not just hours and not just minutes,
[53:48] but he's beginning to fulfill scriptures
[53:50] in a matter of seconds. there there at
[53:52] the cross, he begins to fulfill maybe
[53:55] what we would say hundreds of scriptures
[53:57] where you could trace it back and forth.
[53:59] But you begin to watch as the the the
[54:02] climate that there is in in Jerusalem at
[54:06] that time. You will find a people that
[54:09] are that are in love with Jesus. You
[54:11] will find a people that have that have
[54:13] worshiped Jesus. You can find a people
[54:16] that have been with Jesus when he is
[54:18] feeding them out there in the out there
[54:20] in the fields while he's teaching to
[54:22] them in this crowd that you will begin
[54:25] to see when they would come and be begin
[54:27] to break off palms off of the trees that
[54:30] they would begin to scream out blessed
[54:32] is he that cometh in the name of the
[54:34] Lord. And they're they're there and
[54:36] they're shouting hosana hosana hosana
[54:39] unto the Lord. And to think that the
[54:41] ones that were with him up there on the
[54:44] mountains while he was teaching, the
[54:46] ones that enjoyed the fishes and the
[54:48] loaves, the ones that are in that crowd
[54:51] is what brother Brandon would preach on
[54:53] believers make believers and
[54:55] unbelievers. His disciples are there.
[54:57] They are watching as their Lord is
[55:00] beginning to operate and step into the
[55:03] the fullness of his position that he has
[55:06] been raised up for in that hour. and
[55:08] even his closest friends, men that have
[55:11] walked with him, men that have
[55:13] understood the very power and his agenda
[55:16] why he was sent here. In a matter of
[55:19] three days, they are going to forget all
[55:21] that he has done in a span of three and
[55:24] a half years. They're going to come to
[55:26] such a spot in a spot of disappointment
[55:29] where they are disappointed in the
[55:31] people around them. They are
[55:32] disappointed in what they have seen.
[55:34] They are disappointed that the one that
[55:36] they have longed for is no longer there
[55:39] with them. And they begin to forget the
[55:41] master's words. They begin to get into a
[55:44] spot where they don't realize who Jesus
[55:46] is anymore. And that's the power of
[55:49] disappointment is that it will get you
[55:51] into a spot that you don't recognize
[55:54] what you have been raised for. But I'll
[55:56] just say it like this that they were
[55:58] getting ready to witness the greatest
[56:00] miracle that is still testified even
[56:02] amongst and and Buddhaism
[56:06] even today that there is one that got up
[56:09] out of the grave.
[56:11] Now when you you look at this word
[56:14] resurrection in in the Hebrew it is it
[56:17] is said or in the in the Greek lexicon
[56:20] it is it is spelled and set out like
[56:25] [Music]
[56:27] resurgis from the dead a rising again
[56:30] it's the revival of the dead of the
[56:33] human race or it is their return from
[56:36] the grave and I think it's wonderful
[56:38] when you begin to look at how The Holy
[56:41] Ghost begins to surge in services kind
[56:43] of like what we are have been in as of
[56:46] late. We begin to watch the surge of the
[56:48] resurrection of the Holy Spirit begin to
[56:51] take people that were dead in their
[56:53] trespasses of sin and we begin to see
[56:55] them walk in a newness of life. And you
[56:58] you begin to look and you begin to study
[57:00] out resurrection, you'll find that all
[57:02] the way back there in the Garden of Man
[57:05] in the Garden of Eden that men started
[57:07] down the journey to death. that that if
[57:09] man would not have left the garden, if
[57:12] they would not have left the tree of
[57:13] life, then they would have never been on
[57:15] the journey of death, if they would have
[57:17] just stayed away, if they would have
[57:19] just stayed away from the tree of
[57:21] knowledge and stayed to the tree of
[57:22] life. Then death would have never able
[57:25] ever entered into the picture, it would
[57:27] have never been such a thing that we
[57:28] buried one of our loved ones. But from
[57:31] that day that Eve accepted what what
[57:33] what Satan tried to offer her instead of
[57:37] what God gave her, she started to accept
[57:40] death into her life. And there we begin
[57:42] to watch immoral immortality or immor
[57:45] immortality, we begin to watch death
[57:47] step in.
[57:49] to think that the one that God created
[57:51] out of his own breath and out of his own
[57:54] words, he he begins to from that day
[57:56] that he begins to turn down the word of
[57:58] God that their natural life or natural
[58:01] death begins to start at the time that
[58:04] he begins to take of the tree of
[58:07] knowledge and of good and evil. But we
[58:10] realize that it's not just natural death
[58:12] that you and I are facing, but there is
[58:14] a spiritual death that is upon
[58:17] humankind. And brother random would say
[58:18] it like this that a natural death is not
[58:20] very bad but a spiritual death it is
[58:23] meaning being cut off from God and send
[58:26] away the day of grace. You see the more
[58:28] the more that man begins to eat off of
[58:31] that tree of knowledge. Brother Brandon
[58:32] would say it in several different cases
[58:34] that man begin to bite off automobiles.
[58:37] He begin to bite off gunpowder. He begin
[58:39] to bite off of these things. And the
[58:40] more that he begins to bite off of that
[58:42] tree of knowledge, the more that he
[58:44] kills himself, the more that that man
[58:46] dies. Brother Brandham would say it in
[58:48] the faith in the son of God. He said
[58:50] then when the question mark come across
[58:52] God's word then to me death came in. You
[58:56] see that's all Satan wanted to do was to
[58:58] create a question to create a reason on
[59:01] the inside of Eve. And when he did that
[59:03] that's when death came in. He said and
[59:05] when the question mark comes across your
[59:08] heart he said to God's word that's when
[59:10] death sets in. That's one thing that you
[59:13] and I must be against in this hour.
[59:15] There's a lot of things that we can say
[59:17] that we are against. We We can say we're
[59:19] against this and we can say we're
[59:20] against that. But I'll say that if we're
[59:22] going to say that we're against
[59:24] anything, we've got to be against
[59:26] anything that is questioning the word of
[59:28] God. I believe that we ought to tear
[59:30] down every stronghold. And I believe we
[59:32] ought to tear down every idea that tries
[59:34] to put upon a question in the word of
[59:36] God about your life, about the pastor's
[59:38] life, about this message. I believe that
[59:41] we ought to tear down every question. I
[59:43] believe we ought to tear it down because
[59:45] the the message is the answer to all of
[59:48] them questions because I believe that
[59:50] there's a door that is open in this
[59:51] generation that we recognize that there
[59:54] is nothing that is too hard for our
[59:56] Lord.
[59:58] You see, that's ought to be our
[59:59] objective. It's not just to get people
[1:00:01] to church. Come on, somebody. I'm happy
[1:00:05] that you showed up at church. I'm happy
[1:00:07] that you give your tithes. I'm happy
[1:00:09] that you love the Lord. But that is not
[1:00:11] our objective here at Full Gospel
[1:00:13] Lighthouse. It's not just to have merch
[1:00:15] more church goers and have more people
[1:00:17] that we can shake hands with and have a
[1:00:19] greater fellowship. That's not our
[1:00:21] agenda. But our agenda is to get you to
[1:00:24] the quickening power of Jesus Christ
[1:00:27] that will literally change your life
[1:00:29] from death unto life.
[1:00:32] I believe that too many times people are
[1:00:34] are just associated or they're just
[1:00:36] they're just common with full gospel
[1:00:38] lighthouse or they're common with the
[1:00:40] message. But I believe that the message
[1:00:42] did not come to bring us death. But the
[1:00:44] message came to bring us to life. And if
[1:00:46] all you know is a bunch of quotes and a
[1:00:48] bunch of scriptures, then you ain't got
[1:00:50] very far. But if the quickening power of
[1:00:54] the resurrection of Jesus Christ dwells
[1:00:56] on the inside of you, then Satan does
[1:00:59] not know what to do with a person. Come
[1:01:01] on, somebody. We didn't raise you up
[1:01:04] just to be people that shake our hands
[1:01:05] and to have an experience by shaking
[1:01:08] hands and by just going to church, but
[1:01:10] to have an experience with the same God
[1:01:12] that Peter met. The same God that Peter
[1:01:16] was so upset that he left him. But Peter
[1:01:19] turned around. because he had a
[1:01:22] revelation. He turned around and said,
[1:01:24] "That's my Lord."
[1:01:30] You see, before life can rise
[1:01:36] up, something has got to be laid to
[1:01:38] rest.
[1:01:41] Is that right? Before you can ever walk
[1:01:43] in a newness of life, something's got to
[1:01:45] die. Before you can ever go on in the
[1:01:48] Lord, before you can ever go on in the
[1:01:50] message, something's got to die. That's
[1:01:52] why Paul would say, "And you hath he
[1:01:56] quickened." Come on, somebody. And you
[1:01:58] have he how many you use do we have in
[1:02:00] here? And you hath he quickened. Come
[1:02:03] on, some the message didn't come to you
[1:02:05] just to leave you in a spot where where
[1:02:07] you feel like you're another church or
[1:02:09] feel like you're a better person or feel
[1:02:11] like you're a better churchgoer. Come
[1:02:12] on, somebody. That's what the Baptists
[1:02:14] are doing. They're creating better
[1:02:16] Baptists. They're creating better church
[1:02:17] of God people. They're creating people
[1:02:19] that show up. They might have to have an
[1:02:22] agenda to show up, but that's what
[1:02:24] they're creating. But the message came
[1:02:26] to produce powerhouses that are filled
[1:02:29] with the Holy Ghost that have died to
[1:02:30] themselves and are raised in a newness
[1:02:33] of life. Brother Random in 1957 would
[1:02:36] preach a message called the inunement.
[1:02:38] He said, "And to see those mocking
[1:02:40] priests with spit hanging in his face, a
[1:02:43] man hit him in the head with a reed and
[1:02:45] said, "If you're a prophet, tell us who
[1:02:46] hit you." One of them pulled the beard
[1:02:48] from his face and smacked him in the
[1:02:50] face and wanted him to take up for
[1:02:52] himself. He said, "If my kingdom was of
[1:02:54] this world, hallelujah, I would
[1:02:57] straightway call my father and he would
[1:02:59] send me 12 legions of angels." He said,
[1:03:01] "It could have been changed." He said,
[1:03:03] "It could have been changed, but how
[1:03:04] could he do it?" He just couldn't do it
[1:03:07] for his for his own children was crying
[1:03:09] out for blood. He said, "Could you
[1:03:11] imagine a daddy, a father with his own
[1:03:12] children in the darkness crying out for
[1:03:15] their own father's blood?" He said,
[1:03:16] "That's the reason that he he could do
[1:03:18] nothing else but die." You see, if he
[1:03:20] didn't, he it was doomed for his
[1:03:22] children. It was doomed for the
[1:03:24] creatures, but he had to die to save his
[1:03:26] people. And when he did, he bowed his
[1:03:29] head to this old earth and had a shiver
[1:03:32] round run over its back. It must have
[1:03:35] had a nervous frustration for the Bible
[1:03:37] said that the whole earth from the 6th
[1:03:39] to the 9th hour was dark was over the
[1:03:42] whole face of the earth and the earth
[1:03:44] shook and the rocks rent and the veil
[1:03:47] torn from the top to the bottom. The
[1:03:49] sacrifice the blocks turned over. The
[1:03:52] son of the living God died. He was so
[1:03:54] dead until the sun recognized it. He was
[1:03:57] so dead until the moon recognized it. He
[1:03:59] was so dead till the stars recognized
[1:04:01] it. He was so dead to the earth
[1:04:04] recognized it. He was so dead to the
[1:04:06] elements recognized it. The atmosphere
[1:04:08] recognized it. And everything had to
[1:04:10] know that the son that that was the son
[1:04:14] of God. You see, when Christ was here,
[1:04:16] he came here and he spoke expressingly
[1:04:19] that he had power over death. And there
[1:04:22] were those that had not seen the
[1:04:24] miraculous yet, but they had faith that
[1:04:26] he had the power over death. Because
[1:04:28] when Gyrus when his daughter that was 12
[1:04:30] years old had gotten to a spot where she
[1:04:32] was sick and this infirmity was going to
[1:04:34] lead her to her death but there was
[1:04:36] something on the inside of Gyrus that
[1:04:39] made him go to the resurrection even
[1:04:41] before the res before his daughter ever
[1:04:43] needed resurrection. She was just in a
[1:04:45] spot but this man Gyrus had that much
[1:04:48] faith that even though she wasn't dead
[1:04:50] he could raise her up. But when the turn
[1:04:52] when the master when they come to him,
[1:04:54] the servant came to the master and said,
[1:04:56] "Don't trouble the master no more. Your
[1:04:58] daughter's already dead." Jesus said,
[1:05:01] "Fear not. Believe only. Believe only.
[1:05:04] This this sickness, this sickness, what
[1:05:07] you're going to see, she's just asleep."
[1:05:10] What did Jerus do? He did not stop
[1:05:12] walking with Jesus, but his faith led
[1:05:15] him right on to keep on walking. And I
[1:05:17] say this unto you, full gospel
[1:05:19] lighthouse. No matter what comes your
[1:05:21] way, keep on walking with Jesus. Keep on
[1:05:24] walking with Jes. If death strikes at
[1:05:26] your door, keep on walking with Jesus.
[1:05:30] Well, you know the rest of the
[1:05:32] story that Jesus walks in there and he
[1:05:36] raises that girl that was
[1:05:39] dead back to life. Jesus associates
[1:05:43] being sleep being asleep and dead
[1:05:46] together. When he begins to identify
[1:05:48] Lazarus and Gyrus's daughter, he begins
[1:05:52] to say, "She's not dead, but she's
[1:05:55] asleep." But Jesus has to change the
[1:05:58] wording for those that are around him
[1:06:00] because there are some people that do
[1:06:02] not understand the language of Jesus. So
[1:06:05] Jesus had to kick out the unbelievers to
[1:06:09] show him that he had the power over
[1:06:12] death. I say this that we live in an
[1:06:15] hour where Paul would say to his his
[1:06:18] letter to Timothy in second 2 second 2
[1:06:20] second 2 second 2 second 2 second 2
[1:06:20] second 2 second 2 second 2 second 2
[1:06:20] second 2 second Timothy 3 that in the
[1:06:22] last days in perilous now we're going to
[1:06:24] have perilous times that they'll be
[1:06:26] heady high-minded lovers of pleasures
[1:06:28] lovers of lovers of themselves more than
[1:06:30] lovers of God. He said, "But they'll
[1:06:33] deny the power thereof. They'll deny the
[1:06:36] power. They have a form of godliness.
[1:06:37] They're real close to the thing, but
[1:06:39] they very at the end of it, they'll deny
[1:06:41] the power of it." What are you saying,
[1:06:43] brother Angel? I'm saying in a state
[1:06:45] that you and I are living in, we are
[1:06:46] living in an hour where men deny the
[1:06:49] power of the resurrection. They deny the
[1:06:51] power of the son of man that is here in
[1:06:53] this generation. But Gyrus recognized
[1:06:56] that he was not going to deny that
[1:06:58] power. He was a leader in that church.
[1:07:01] He was a leader in that synagogue. He
[1:07:03] was a leader in that city. But his faith
[1:07:05] did not faint on him, but it got
[1:07:08] stronger.
[1:07:10] It got stronger. And brother Mham would
[1:07:12] say in recognizing his day, recognizing
[1:07:15] your day and its message, he said Gyrus
[1:07:17] be to recognize his presence. He said
[1:07:20] he's appearing to us in these meetings
[1:07:22] for one purpose, and that's to release
[1:07:24] our desires that we have in him. But
[1:07:27] when Gyrus recognized that
[1:07:30] power, he recognized that was all his
[1:07:33] little girl needed. I say this to every
[1:07:36] every young person. This is all that you
[1:07:38] need. If you can just recognize that
[1:07:41] he's got the power to get you up out of
[1:07:43] your sin, out of your sickness, out of
[1:07:45] your trouble. If you can recognize him,
[1:07:48] Brother Brandham said that. That's when
[1:07:50] he releases his power to you.
[1:07:55] Glory. When you recognize that it ain't
[1:07:59] brother Ron, that's when it's a release
[1:08:02] of power. When you recognize it's not
[1:08:04] brother William, that's when it's a
[1:08:06] release of power. When do things start
[1:08:09] changing in an atmosphere like this is
[1:08:11] when there's a recognition that it's not
[1:08:14] the man, but there's a God that's
[1:08:16] backing it up.
[1:08:18] But I'm not going to be one of them that
[1:08:20] deny the power of the resurrection. I've
[1:08:22] seen it work in this generation. I've
[1:08:25] seen the power of the Holy Ghost move
[1:08:27] and transform lives.
[1:08:30] Hallelujah. Let me say this. They the
[1:08:34] widow of Na son, he was not a denier
[1:08:37] that God had the power over death
[1:08:40] because Jesus just went by and touched
[1:08:42] the brow of the casket when he walked by
[1:08:45] there and he raised him back to life
[1:08:47] again. when he went down to Lazarus and
[1:08:50] his sisters came down there to him and
[1:08:52] said, "Look, your friend that you love
[1:08:55] is sick." But Jesus said, "Now, I love
[1:08:58] this, brother." He said, "This sickness
[1:08:59] is not unto death."
[1:09:02] He said, "This sickness is not under
[1:09:04] death." And Jesus begins to tarry
[1:09:06] because he's got to allow the the the
[1:09:09] moment he's got to allow the moment of
[1:09:11] the miracle to transpire. You see, if
[1:09:15] there is no death, there can be no
[1:09:18] resurrection. And before we can know him
[1:09:21] as the God of
[1:09:22] resurrection, we got to know him that we
[1:09:25] can be planted in him in the likeness of
[1:09:28] his death, then we'll be raised in the
[1:09:30] likeness of his resurrection. Come on,
[1:09:32] somebody. You might have been
[1:09:34] disappointed with a lot of people, but
[1:09:36] the resurrection power will never let
[1:09:38] you down.
[1:09:41] Can you imagine what was going through
[1:09:43] Jesus's
[1:09:44] mind? Remember, he's God. Remember, he's
[1:09:49] a prophet. Remember, he's got eyesight
[1:09:51] to be able to look at situations
[1:09:53] differently than you and I look at them.
[1:09:56] He doesn't just see the glory that's
[1:09:58] coming from it, but he sees the hurt.
[1:10:03] All right, somebody. He sees the
[1:10:05] hurt. He sees the hurt. He sees the pain
[1:10:09] that Lazarus is going to go through.
[1:10:12] Where's my friend at?
[1:10:16] Hallelujah. Where's my friend
[1:10:19] at? But he has to allow him to slip into
[1:10:24] another
[1:10:25] world. Before you can ever recognize him
[1:10:28] as the God of victory, things have got
[1:10:31] to look like a
[1:10:33] defeat. I love what the prophet said.
[1:10:36] Faith knows no defeat.
[1:10:42] And Jesus brings word to his disciples
[1:10:45] and said, "Our friend Lazarus is
[1:10:47] asleep." And they begin to say, because
[1:10:50] they didn't understand his language,
[1:10:51] they begin to say, "Look, if he's if
[1:10:53] he's asleep, then he's going to do
[1:10:54] well." And Jesus looked at them and
[1:10:56] said, "He's dead.
[1:11:00] Wait a minute. That's a change." Well,
[1:11:04] Lord, you just said a few days ago that
[1:11:07] this sickness was not unto death, but
[1:11:09] now you're turning again and saying that
[1:11:11] it's he's dead. Who are you? Are we
[1:11:15] really following the God of the
[1:11:17] resurrection or not? But Jesus starts
[1:11:19] taking a walk. Whether people are with
[1:11:22] him or people are not believing him,
[1:11:24] Jesus starts walking to his friend's
[1:11:27] grave.
[1:11:30] Hallelujah. I'm preaching and I'm
[1:11:32] enjoying it.
[1:11:35] But Martha sees him coming and she said,
[1:11:38] "Lord, if you'd have been here, my
[1:11:40] brother would not have died." She still
[1:11:42] had faith in him. She still had faith in
[1:11:45] him. She said unto her, "Thy brother
[1:11:48] shall live again." She said, "I know
[1:11:51] he'll raise again in the last day."
[1:11:53] Because amongst the Pharisees and
[1:11:55] Sadducees, there was a disagreement. The
[1:11:58] Sadducees didn't believe in a
[1:11:59] resurrection, but the Pharisees believed
[1:12:01] in both, they believed that there was a
[1:12:04] resurrection. And though they may have
[1:12:06] never saw the person of resurrection,
[1:12:08] they believed in it. I think that's
[1:12:10] going to turn around on them one day. I
[1:12:13] think it's going to turn around on them
[1:12:14] while they're up there and they're
[1:12:16] crucifying him and they got a part to
[1:12:18] play and then they're going to try to
[1:12:20] turn around and deny that he ever rose
[1:12:21] again.
[1:12:24] But this woman was of a different
[1:12:26] lineage. She was neither Pharisee nor
[1:12:29] Sadducee. But she came from the very
[1:12:32] mind of God where she understood that
[1:12:34] God had a power that even though
[1:12:37] deadness had struck in that she she
[1:12:39] realized that that man had the power. I
[1:12:42] want to ask you again today, do you
[1:12:44] believe that he still got that kind of
[1:12:46] power? Is he still the same yesterday,
[1:12:49] today, and forever? Is he a changed God
[1:12:51] or is he a dead God? But I say this unto
[1:12:54] you. According to my faith in the
[1:12:56] scriptures, he is a God that lives.
[1:13:02] Don't you worry, Martha. Don't you
[1:13:04] worry, Martha. The person that you're
[1:13:06] looking for, I am I am Lazarus's help. I
[1:13:11] am Lazarus's gift. I am Lazarus's
[1:13:13] resurrection. I am the resurrection and
[1:13:16] the life.
[1:13:19] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You see this?
[1:13:22] Lazarus was in a spot that he needed
[1:13:24] some help. Go study out loud what
[1:13:26] Lazarus is mean. He was in a spot where
[1:13:30] he needed some help and all of a sudden
[1:13:32] Jesus shows
[1:13:35] up. How many ever had that happen to
[1:13:38] him? Where you been in a spot when you
[1:13:40] and all you seeing nothing but bunch of
[1:13:42] deadness around you? Ain't no life
[1:13:44] there. Ain't no power there. And all of
[1:13:46] a sudden Jesus shows up.
[1:13:48] I want you to know this that God ain't
[1:13:50] missed his
[1:13:51] moment. God ain't missed his moment to
[1:13:53] show up and show that he's almighty God.
[1:13:56] You see, it might look like he's he's
[1:13:58] missed his moment to you. He might be
[1:14:00] four days late, but he's right on time.
[1:14:02] It might look like he's letting prodals
[1:14:04] go way out too far, but I say he's right
[1:14:06] on time. It might look like cancers is
[1:14:08] raging, but I say he's right on time. It
[1:14:11] might look like things of this lay age
[1:14:13] are taking over us, but I say he's right
[1:14:15] on time. He's not missing his moment for
[1:14:19] the miraculous because Christ, his whole
[1:14:22] entire ministry is built about raising
[1:14:26] up. His whole ministry is about
[1:14:30] resurrection
[1:14:31] because Jesus said in John 6 and4 639
[1:14:36] and 40 that this is the father's will
[1:14:38] which have sent me that of all which
[1:14:40] have given me I should lose nothing but
[1:14:44] should raise it up again at the last day
[1:14:47] and this is the will of him that sent me
[1:14:49] that everyone which seeth the son and
[1:14:52] believeth on him may have everlasting
[1:14:55] life. Now, do you trust him?
[1:14:59] Do you trust him?
[1:15:02] And
[1:15:03] I, the one you trust in will raise him
[1:15:06] up at the last
[1:15:09] day. There's somebody that still
[1:15:12] believes.
[1:15:15] When the devil ain't done nothing but
[1:15:17] try to hinder you from believing in
[1:15:19] this. When he's tried to keep you, he's
[1:15:21] all right with you believing in a God
[1:15:23] that raised up 2,000 years ago, but he
[1:15:25] does not want you believing that he's
[1:15:27] the same God that can do it do it again.
[1:15:30] Come on, somebody. But brother Doug is
[1:15:32] here to show that he's still the same
[1:15:34] yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:15:37] Come on, somebody. How many times has
[1:15:39] Ron Spencer been dead?
[1:15:42] But I say this unto you, Jesus Christ is
[1:15:45] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:15:48] A fire couldn't kill him. Lightning
[1:15:51] couldn't kill him. Rattlesnakes and
[1:15:53] copperheads couldn't kill him.
[1:15:54] Heartaches can't couldn't kill him. And
[1:15:57] I'll go a little bit further. The
[1:15:58] disease of this age, cancer cannot kill
[1:16:02] him. It'll be Almighty God that decides
[1:16:06] when I leave and when I go.
[1:16:15] You see, that's the devil's job to put
[1:16:17] you in the pit. Don't put yourself
[1:16:18] there. That's the devil's job to put you
[1:16:21] in the pit. But it's God's go It's God's
[1:16:24] job to get you out. It's the devil's job
[1:16:26] to put you in trouble. It's a devil's
[1:16:28] job to make you into put you in a spot
[1:16:30] where you believe that he doesn't have
[1:16:32] resurrection power no more. So he begins
[1:16:35] to put you in a pit of despair, in a pit
[1:16:37] of depression, in a pit of anxiety. But
[1:16:40] I love what David said in Psalms 40 and2
[1:16:43] that he brought me up out of a horrible
[1:16:46] pit, horrible pit, out of a miry clay
[1:16:49] and he set my foot on a rock and
[1:16:52] established my guns. Satan does not want
[1:16:55] you to rise. Satan does not want you to
[1:16:58] raise up. He does not want you to
[1:17:00] anticipate the rapture is for you. He
[1:17:03] wants to keep you in a pit, but God is
[1:17:06] here to bring you up out of that. I say
[1:17:08] it's time to rise. It's time to rise. I
[1:17:12] say let God be God and let his enemies
[1:17:15] be scattered.
[1:17:18] Hallelujah. I say it's time to rise and
[1:17:20] believe all things are possible. I say
[1:17:22] it's time to rise and believe that this
[1:17:24] message is for you and stop wasting your
[1:17:27] time. We're not here to play church.
[1:17:30] We're here to take a rapture. We're not
[1:17:32] here just to put a pacifier in your
[1:17:34] mouth and get you through. We're here to
[1:17:37] see you overcome.
[1:17:42] Well, if he got up out of the grave,
[1:17:44] I'mma walk into
[1:17:47] Somebody's going to rise up and they're
[1:17:49] going to walk out of that pit. I'm going
[1:17:50] to say that it's for you. I'm going to
[1:17:53] say it's for you to rise up. I'm going
[1:17:55] say
[1:17:56] if if Satan puts you in trouble, God
[1:18:00] will get you out.
[1:18:03] Hallelujah. I can hear a prophet say,
[1:18:05] "Satan may pin you in a corner. He may
[1:18:08] put you in a car wreck and an automobile
[1:18:10] right up on you. He might put cancer on
[1:18:12] you. But God will make a way out."
[1:18:16] I'm going to say it's time for you to
[1:18:18] rise. And you're going to rise. I say if
[1:18:22] Joseph got was sold into slavery and he
[1:18:25] and he rose to power then you can rise.
[1:18:28] If Moses was a shepherd and became a
[1:18:30] leader then you can rise. If the
[1:18:33] Israelites went from slavery to freedom
[1:18:35] then you can rise. If David went from a
[1:18:37] shepherd to a king then you can rise. If
[1:18:40] Job went from deep suffering to a
[1:18:43] restored blessings then you can rise. If
[1:18:45] Rahab could rise from a life of sin to
[1:18:48] becoming an ancestor of Jesus, then you
[1:18:50] can rise. If Nehemiah could come and
[1:18:53] rise from a cup bearer to a governor,
[1:18:56] then you can rise. If Esther could rise
[1:18:58] as an orphan to a queen, then you can
[1:19:01] rise. If the widow of Zarapath could
[1:19:03] rise from starvation to abundance, then
[1:19:06] you can
[1:19:08] rise. If Naomi could rise from
[1:19:11] bitterness to joy, then you can rise.
[1:19:14] Come on, somebody. If Lazarus could get
[1:19:16] up out of a grave, then you can rise.
[1:19:20] If Tamar could leave a tragic situation,
[1:19:24] then you can rise.
[1:19:28] Ain't none of you worse than Jonah.
[1:19:29] Ain't none of you worse than Lazarus. I
[1:19:31] say it's time to rise and
[1:19:36] shine.
[1:19:40] Our God is a God of resurrection.
[1:19:47] How many countless
[1:19:49] stories could I take you through where
[1:19:52] you should have never got up, but the
[1:19:54] pillar of fire made away?
[1:19:57] How many times could we punch into those
[1:19:59] that should have been dead and sin and
[1:20:00] should have died in car wrecks and
[1:20:02] should have died on do on dope and
[1:20:04] should have died on alcohol and alcohol
[1:20:06] poisoning and and all kinds of terrible
[1:20:08] things. But something on the inside
[1:20:11] begin to rise up and say I'm greater
[1:20:12] than drugs. I'm greater than sin. I'm
[1:20:15] greater than
[1:20:17] addictions. I say it like this. It's a
[1:20:20] gene seed in
[1:20:21] you that refuses to let you stay in your
[1:20:24] traditions. It refuses to let you stay
[1:20:27] in that sickness. It refuses for you to
[1:20:30] stay in deadness. That gene has got to
[1:20:33] be watered. And the only thing that you
[1:20:36] can be watered by is the message of the
[1:20:38] hour. William Brandon would say, "If I
[1:20:41] brought to you a Methodist idea or a or
[1:20:44] a or or a church of God, a church of God
[1:20:46] message," he said, "It would take no
[1:20:48] effect upon you." He said, "Because the
[1:20:51] gene of this hour or the seed of this
[1:20:52] hour has got to be watered of the seed
[1:20:55] of the message of the hour."
[1:21:00] I love when Isaiah begins to tap in to
[1:21:04] the
[1:21:06] resurrection. He says in Isaiah 26 and
[1:21:09] 19, "Thy dead man shall live together
[1:21:12] with my dead
[1:21:14] body, and they shall arise.
[1:21:19] What are you saying? What's Isaiah
[1:21:21] saying to us? There's one
[1:21:25] coming. There's one
[1:21:27] coming. Now you say, "Well, how does
[1:21:29] that matter to me, Brother Andrew? I'm
[1:21:31] identified with him in his death. I'm
[1:21:34] identified with him in his burial. I'm
[1:21:37] identified with him in his resurrection.
[1:21:39] I'm identified with him when he would
[1:21:40] poured out his poured out his spirit on
[1:21:42] the day of Pentecost. I'm identified
[1:21:44] with him when he knocked Paul off of off
[1:21:47] of his high horse and he brought him in
[1:21:49] to be the first church age messenger.
[1:21:51] I'm identified with a God that is
[1:21:53] greater than the deadness of Sadducees
[1:21:55] and Pharisees.
[1:21:58] But in order for there to be a
[1:22:01] resurrection, there's got to be a death.
[1:22:06] That's just how it is.
[1:22:10] For those that sleep in Jesus will
[1:22:12] Christ rise first.
[1:22:15] But they ain't going to be perfect
[1:22:16] without you and me.
[1:22:19] There are some here in this building
[1:22:21] that will not taste of death.
[1:22:25] I had an older minister one time. He sat
[1:22:28] me down as a young boy and he said, "Now
[1:22:32] look, I'm not going to get to see it.
[1:22:37] I'm not going to get to see it, but
[1:22:39] brother Andrew, you're going to see it.
[1:22:48] I don't know how that brother knew knew
[1:22:50] that, but it it was right. So, if that
[1:22:54] part was
[1:22:58] right, then the second part's right. But
[1:23:02] there are some here that will not taste
[1:23:05] of death. Now, if the rapture is is
[1:23:09] awaiting us for 10 more years, then
[1:23:11] there's going to be a lot of changes
[1:23:12] here.
[1:23:14] But there is going to be some here
[1:23:16] amongst us that will not taste of death.
[1:23:21] They won't understand the sting of
[1:23:23] death, but they'll literally be standing
[1:23:26] here one moment and all of a sudden, as
[1:23:28] brother Brandon would say, a sweep will
[1:23:31] go over you. But the reason why there
[1:23:34] can be a sweep is because there was a
[1:23:36] death.
[1:23:38] What are you talking about, brother? I'm
[1:23:40] talking about the death to yourself, the
[1:23:42] death to your flesh, the death to your
[1:23:45] soul, and accepting the life.
[1:23:49] That's why in the book of Revelations
[1:23:51] chapter 20, it said they have their
[1:23:54] part. Said, "Blessed are an honor to
[1:23:57] them that have their part in the first
[1:24:01] resurrection." And he goes on to say,
[1:24:04] the writer goes on to say, "And the
[1:24:06] second death have no power over them."
[1:24:10] Let me say this, there is a spiritual
[1:24:12] death. There is a first death, and there
[1:24:14] is a second death. But if you've been
[1:24:17] born again from above, you cannot have
[1:24:20] be a part of the second death.
[1:24:24] What are you saying, brother? I'm saying
[1:24:27] if you have not taken of the first
[1:24:30] death so you can have the first
[1:24:33] resurrection.
[1:24:36] Come on, somebody. Somebody's going to
[1:24:38] go somebody's going to go through the
[1:24:39] second resurrection. But I'm going to go
[1:24:42] through the first. I'm going to be in a
[1:24:44] rapture. I'm not going through the
[1:24:46] tribulation. What are you saying? I'm
[1:24:47] saying if there's one in the state of
[1:24:49] Virginia, if there's one in the state of
[1:24:51] the United States of America, I'm going
[1:24:53] to be that one.
[1:24:58] What a resurrection that was. But what a
[1:25:01] resurrection this
[1:25:04] is. I'm only halfway through and you're
[1:25:08] just getting to a spot where you're
[1:25:10] preaching real good with me. Come on.
[1:25:13] When brother Brandham, he comes and he
[1:25:15] preaches a very powerful message to this
[1:25:19] generation. And he titles it the
[1:25:22] indictment. And he takes from the
[1:25:26] scripture. He said to add to my text to
[1:25:29] break back in this he said I'd like to
[1:25:32] take these four words. There they
[1:25:37] crucified him. They the most holy city
[1:25:41] in the world,
[1:25:43] Jerusalem. They the most religious city
[1:25:46] in the world. They the most religious
[1:25:49] people in the world. Crucified the most
[1:25:52] shameful death that could be kill a
[1:25:55] person could be killed naked, stripped
[1:25:57] and closed. He was
[1:25:59] despised with a
[1:26:01] reproach. There they crucified him. the
[1:26:05] most precious person.
[1:26:13] The people that was his kinfolk,
[1:26:17] the people that was made out of the same
[1:26:19] dirt that he was made out
[1:26:22] of, Israelite
[1:26:28] dirt. Israelite
[1:26:31] dirt. there they crucified
[1:26:37] him. You see, they didn't recognize what
[1:26:41] they were doing,
[1:26:43] but yet it was in God's mind that
[1:26:46] somebody was going to have to step up to
[1:26:50] prove they had the power over all the
[1:26:53] supernatural. It was not just good
[1:26:55] enough for Jesus to heal the sick.
[1:26:57] Prophets had done that before. It was
[1:26:59] not just good enough for him to discern
[1:27:01] their hearts. Prophets had done that
[1:27:03] before. It was not just good enough for
[1:27:05] him to die. Men had done that before.
[1:27:08] But he had to get up for him to be God.
[1:27:11] And for him to remain God, then he's got
[1:27:14] to get up.
[1:27:17] If you can hear what I'm saying to you,
[1:27:18] you got to get up. You got to get up out
[1:27:20] of what people think about you. You got
[1:27:22] to get up out of Gleasia. Get up. Get
[1:27:25] up. Get up.
[1:27:29] You watch the same things done today.
[1:27:32] There they crucified this word
[1:27:37] where at the most holy of holies
[1:27:41] the religions of the world again have
[1:27:44] turned around and crucified.
[1:27:50] Said wasn't one Calvary enough.
[1:27:56] Hallelujah.
[1:27:58] Wasn't it enough?
[1:28:01] But I wonder how many times we
[1:28:03] crucifying him
[1:28:06] by letting things slide in and letting
[1:28:09] the message become commonplace to us
[1:28:12] or letting laya slip in and try to give
[1:28:15] us some watered down ideas about the
[1:28:17] message.
[1:28:19] Let me preach.
[1:28:21] So here you begin to watch a change over
[1:28:25] when Jesus is there on on that Friday.
[1:28:30] You begin to watch a changeover because
[1:28:33] there at that time the pascal lamb was
[1:28:35] still in operation. And there at that
[1:28:39] time only the high priest could go in
[1:28:41] there once a year and he could walk in
[1:28:43] there behind that blood veil. He could
[1:28:46] walk in there. You see it was a natural
[1:28:48] veil. And any man that walked in there
[1:28:51] that didn't have the anointing upon
[1:28:52] them, it was all of a sudden a natural
[1:28:54] death that came upon them. But our
[1:28:56] prophet stood in the unveiling of God
[1:28:58] and said, "Now it's death not to enter
[1:29:01] into there and it's spiritual death not
[1:29:03] to go in there." He went on to say, he
[1:29:06] said, "You notice that last plague in
[1:29:08] Egypt was death before the Exodus." He
[1:29:10] said, "The last plague on this earth is
[1:29:12] spiritual death before the Exodus. There
[1:29:15] they'll be cremated. return back into
[1:29:18] dust and the righteous will walk out
[1:29:20] upon the ashes. But the last thing is is
[1:29:23] spiritual death. It's a rejecting of
[1:29:26] this word.
[1:29:31] The blood of that lamb was in effect
[1:29:34] until this
[1:29:36] day until he died on that cross until
[1:29:41] the hour that he was hanging there. and
[1:29:44] God changed the system. There could be
[1:29:47] men that walked in there and they could
[1:29:49] feel the presence of God. They could
[1:29:51] walk in there under the blood and they
[1:29:54] were under that law and there could be
[1:29:56] powerful things that would happen. But
[1:29:58] when Jesus died and he ripped the veil
[1:30:02] from Hallelujah, he ripped traditions
[1:30:04] down. He ripped it apart that moment,
[1:30:08] that day, there was death to walk in
[1:30:10] there and accept the dead creed anymore.
[1:30:13] But the only way to laugh was to come to
[1:30:15] the one that had just died.
[1:30:23] I love what the prophet said. He said it
[1:30:26] was effect in effect until that hour.
[1:30:28] The blood of the lamb was all right
[1:30:30] until that day, but now the crucifixion,
[1:30:33] it changes. The old system is gone. He
[1:30:36] went on down a little lower. He said,
[1:30:38] "And from that old pascal lamb, it
[1:30:40] passed away and Christ became our lamb
[1:30:42] at the day of the crucifixion and the
[1:30:45] and the day that the denomination
[1:30:48] crucified the word of God and accepted a
[1:30:51] creed instead of the word of
[1:30:54] God." That's the day the word came into
[1:30:57] full
[1:31:00] effect. That's been just recently. The
[1:31:04] prophet said the day the
[1:31:08] denominations crucified the word of
[1:31:10] God. That's the day the word came into
[1:31:15] full effect. What are you saying,
[1:31:17] brother Andrew? I'm saying it was not in
[1:31:19] any other age or in any other hour that
[1:31:22] the lamb stood up in this hour. Luther's
[1:31:24] the in Luther's age the lamb didn't
[1:31:27] stand up. In Wesley's age, the lamb
[1:31:29] didn't stand up because their message
[1:31:32] could not produce a full restoration.
[1:31:35] But Luther's was to start the
[1:31:38] reformation. You begin to study the word
[1:31:40] of God, you'll see in Revelations 2 and
[1:31:42] three that he said, "I have seen of thee
[1:31:45] that thy works are not perfect." And the
[1:31:47] prophet taught us that that word means
[1:31:50] unfulfilled. He said it was unfulfilled
[1:31:53] in Luther's day. He said, "But it had
[1:31:55] been written 1500 years
[1:31:57] before." Are you following me? Okay.
[1:32:01] Those that are following me, say,
[1:32:02] "Amen." Raise your hand. Amen. And raise
[1:32:06] your hand. That's pretty good
[1:32:08] deal.
[1:32:11] Amen. But there he said it 1500 years.
[1:32:15] They're waiting on it. But what did
[1:32:17] brother Brandham say? He said, "Now
[1:32:19] Luther, you're going to start this."
[1:32:21] That's what God is saying. He said,
[1:32:23] "You're going to start this." He said,
[1:32:25] "But I'm holding it back." He said,
[1:32:27] "You're going to start some things, but
[1:32:29] I'm leaving that till later on." You
[1:32:32] see, Luther couldn't touch this message.
[1:32:35] He had some spiritual insight, but he
[1:32:38] couldn't tap into the
[1:32:39] restoration because he didn't have full
[1:32:41] access to it. Come on, somebody. Wesley
[1:32:44] was a powerful man. Wesley had
[1:32:46] supernatural meetings. Wesley had some
[1:32:49] supernatural miracles that took place,
[1:32:51] but he could not
[1:32:53] touch he could not touch the restoration
[1:32:56] of this word in this hour because it had
[1:32:58] to be for a seventh star that would rise
[1:33:01] out in a dark generation that would
[1:33:04] break the darkness and bring light to
[1:33:06] this world.
[1:33:09] Let me say it's a it's a whole lot of
[1:33:11] darkness out there in Egypt, but
[1:33:12] Israel's got some light down there in
[1:33:14] Goan. She knows what she's looking at.
[1:33:18] Notice the light wasn't everywhere, but
[1:33:20] it was in the tent where they were
[1:33:22] sitting at. And in the tent of this
[1:33:24] message where he said, "I'll meet you in
[1:33:27] there." That's where there's light at in
[1:33:30] this third pull ministry. That's why
[1:33:32] Satan don't know what to do with you.
[1:33:34] You're a third pull
[1:33:38] people. This is that day. This is that
[1:33:42] hour. What are you saying, brother
[1:33:43] Andrew? Everything you have need of is
[1:33:46] in you.
[1:33:51] Oh, what a resurrection this is.
[1:33:56] Luther wanted it. Wesley wanted it.
[1:33:59] Pentecost wanted it.
[1:34:02] But it's here.
[1:34:04] What a resurrection that was. But what a
[1:34:07] resurrection this is.
[1:34:15] Now you know what the Bible said in
[1:34:17] Revelation chapter 5. And I saw in the
[1:34:20] right hand of him that sat upon the
[1:34:22] throne a book written and seals within
[1:34:27] and seals on the
[1:34:29] backside. And John, you remember what
[1:34:31] John does? John starts looking
[1:34:33] throughout all of heaven. He starts
[1:34:35] looking down through all the earth and
[1:34:37] he ain't finding
[1:34:38] nobody. But as David said, "If I ascend
[1:34:42] into the heights, thou art there. If I
[1:34:44] ascend into the depths, thou art there."
[1:34:47] And
[1:34:48] nowhere, nowhere did John find anybody
[1:34:51] that was worthy to loose
[1:34:53] you. He didn't find nobody. But there
[1:34:56] came a voice. Aren't you thankful for a
[1:34:59] voice? There came a voice in the midst
[1:35:01] and said, "Don't weep, John. Quit your
[1:35:03] weeping. Wipe your tears off." I'm
[1:35:06] saying this to you. Take your hanky out
[1:35:08] and wipe your tears
[1:35:10] off. Come on, somebody. Wipe away the
[1:35:12] tears of Leoa and the disappointments of
[1:35:15] life. Wipe it away. For there's one
[1:35:18] that's worthy. There's one that's going
[1:35:20] to stand up for you.
[1:35:23] You know the power. If he don't stand
[1:35:24] up, don't you? You don't even see
[1:35:26] yourself. You can't be released. But
[1:35:29] because he stood up, come on, church.
[1:35:32] I'm preaching to you message.
[1:35:34] This message has liberated you.
[1:35:41] Come on, somebody. The pope ain't
[1:35:42] worthy. The bishops ain't worthy. The
[1:35:44] priest ain't worthy. What was Christ
[1:35:47] doing? He was standing up to redeem his
[1:35:49] fallen bride.
[1:35:52] He was
[1:35:53] accepting what he was raised for.
[1:36:00] Now, I'm going to turn that. Are you
[1:36:03] willing to accept what you're raised
[1:36:04] for?
[1:36:08] Think about it. Let's have a real solemn
[1:36:11] moment right here. Are you willing to
[1:36:13] accept what you've been raised up for?
[1:36:17] Well, what is that, brother Andrew? Oh,
[1:36:19] it ain't that
[1:36:20] hard. You just got to stand in front of
[1:36:22] every laying devil and you got to
[1:36:25] proclaim the message is right. Are you
[1:36:28] willing to accept what you've been
[1:36:29] raised for? When people come against it,
[1:36:32] are you willing to accept what you've
[1:36:33] been raised for? When every devil
[1:36:35] screaming against you, are you willing
[1:36:37] to accept what you've been raised for?
[1:36:39] When every devil in hell's trying to
[1:36:40] stop you from going in the rapture, are
[1:36:42] you going to be able to accept what
[1:36:43] you've been raised for? Come on,
[1:36:45] somebody. It ain't very hard. You ain't
[1:36:47] got to create a new wheel. Just get on
[1:36:48] the message bike and roll. Ride. Ride
[1:36:52] this message. I'm riding on it. I'm
[1:36:54] riding on it. I'm not trusting in my own
[1:36:57] merits. I'm riding on this message.
[1:37:01] And this message going to take me to a
[1:37:02] resurrection. This message is going to
[1:37:04] take me to a rapture.
[1:37:15] Oh, you see what Ruth what put Ruth in
[1:37:20] position to accept what she was raised
[1:37:24] for was the death of her first husband.
[1:37:31] Because if she did not have the death of
[1:37:33] her first husband, there could not be no
[1:37:35] union between her and
[1:37:38] Boaz. But because but because her loved
[1:37:41] one, because of her first nature, let me
[1:37:43] come to you. But because your first
[1:37:45] nature has died, it has put you in a
[1:37:48] position to accept your Boaz. What did
[1:37:52] he do? He took Ro, he took Ruth and took
[1:37:55] her from a Moabitis to the next owner of
[1:37:58] the field. Come on, somebody. He took
[1:38:00] you from working in the field to being
[1:38:03] putting you as an owner over top of the
[1:38:06] field.
[1:38:08] You see what this message has done you?
[1:38:10] It took you from the chicken pin and it
[1:38:12] put you in an eagle pin.
[1:38:15] Come on, somebody. This message has the
[1:38:17] ability to take you from where you were
[1:38:20] not supposed to be and raise you to the
[1:38:23] position that God's destined you for.
[1:38:25] Let me say this. With everything that's
[1:38:27] within me, I love them people out there,
[1:38:30] but they have no power to put you in a
[1:38:33] rapture outside of this message.
[1:38:37] How do you say that? Because they don't
[1:38:39] have a restoration.
[1:38:43] But to
[1:38:44] you. But to you, what are you saying,
[1:38:48] brother Andrew? I'm saying they
[1:38:50] crucified the very one that you have in
[1:38:53] your life.
[1:38:56] They turned him down. I was just taking
[1:38:59] brother Tom or brother Michael Ray just
[1:39:01] down the road here where brother
[1:39:03] Brandham came here and preached on
[1:39:05] Summit Avenue before he preached in the
[1:39:08] convention out here in Harrisonburg.
[1:39:11] Billy Paul said that brother Brandon
[1:39:12] would like to come in to different areas
[1:39:14] before the meeting and he would
[1:39:16] minister. He would minister and begin to
[1:39:19] build up a repertoire amongst the
[1:39:21] amongst the people of the area. Brother
[1:39:23] Brandham host a meeting right down here
[1:39:26] at the Pentecostal church on Summit
[1:39:29] Avenue and they would not follow the
[1:39:31] message because William Brandham was
[1:39:34] wearing a wristwatch.
[1:39:37] That Summit Avenue church turned him
[1:39:39] down. But the Full Gospel Lighthouse
[1:39:41] Summit Avenue that was birthed on that
[1:39:44] same street, they recognized they they
[1:39:49] accepted what they were raised for. They
[1:39:52] didn't want it, but God raised up seed
[1:39:55] that would accept
[1:39:59] it. I didn't make myself accept it. I
[1:40:02] didn't put myself in position. But my
[1:40:05] Boaz, my Boaz redeemed me from a devil's
[1:40:09] hail. My
[1:40:13] [Applause]
[1:40:16] Boaz. Oh, somebody give the Lord a hand
[1:40:19] clap of
[1:40:24] praise. What was God doing? He was
[1:40:27] positioning you for redemption, for
[1:40:30] resurrection.
[1:40:37] Now, I ain't got time to close this out
[1:40:41] tonight cuz y'all going to kill
[1:40:44] me. And I want to be able to amen my
[1:40:46] pastor in the morning.
[1:40:50] So, but you can imagine and I just want
[1:40:53] to maybe I'll pick this up at another
[1:40:55] time.
[1:41:02] You imagine the people that were that
[1:41:05] close with
[1:41:07] him. They've watched him
[1:41:12] die. They helped carry him to the tomb
[1:41:15] of Joseph
[1:41:20] Arythea. They have
[1:41:22] weep. They have
[1:41:24] cried. They have mourned.
[1:41:29] But it was at the rising of the
[1:41:33] sun that they recognized that it was no
[1:41:36] longer
[1:41:39] sudden day. You see, he owns the
[1:41:44] field. He owns the
[1:41:46] field. So, he's got to raise up one from
[1:41:49] the field that he could wave over the
[1:41:52] people.
[1:41:55] He didn't trust it to
[1:41:59] Peter, but he trusted to the son of
[1:42:03] God. Because when you study out the book
[1:42:05] of Leviticus chapter
[1:42:07] 23, when they when they would come to
[1:42:09] the
[1:42:10] feast, that there would be a waving of
[1:42:13] the sheath before the high priest. And
[1:42:17] you realize what has transpired in this
[1:42:20] day that we have moved into a Melzdc
[1:42:23] priesthood.
[1:42:24] But we realize that what's been waved in
[1:42:28] this hour was the same thing that was
[1:42:30] waved in that hour. Because the first
[1:42:33] one that comes of the first fruits, you
[1:42:36] be see, you begin to recognize it was a
[1:42:39] sign to them priests that there was more
[1:42:41] like it that was coming. And when Jesus
[1:42:45] when Almighty God saw our Lord Jesus, he
[1:42:49] picked him up and he waved him across
[1:42:52] that generation because he recognized
[1:42:54] that there was a field that was full
[1:42:57] that had to come forth. And all of a
[1:42:59] sudden, 50 days later on the day of
[1:43:02] Pentecost, he began to wave himself. He
[1:43:05] began to wave himself over a 120 wheat
[1:43:08] and they brought what was it? They
[1:43:10] wasn't a part of the shook. There was a
[1:43:12] part of the grain himself because a corn
[1:43:15] went into that grain of corn went
[1:43:17] through the ground. But if it die, it
[1:43:19] abideth alone. But if Hallelujah, if it
[1:43:23] rises again, there'll be much abundance
[1:43:25] that comes with it. What was it? This
[1:43:28] message in this hour. Come on, somebody.
[1:43:32] Luther was raised up in his hour and he
[1:43:35] fulfilled the reformation. But let me
[1:43:37] say it like this. William Brandon was
[1:43:39] raised in this hour and he was raised
[1:43:41] for a restoration and this message that
[1:43:44] has crossed the world seven times was
[1:43:46] waved over it saying there's more
[1:43:50] coming. Come on somebody. That's our
[1:43:52] Lord Jesus up there. Come on somebody.
[1:43:55] Don't you stop at that sign. You keep
[1:43:57] going. The sign's pointing you to
[1:44:00] something. There's a lot of people that
[1:44:02] hate that picture, but that's our sign
[1:44:04] right there. That's our sign right
[1:44:06] there. It's a true sign that's
[1:44:08] overlooked in this generation. That's
[1:44:10] our sign. But don't stop at the
[1:44:13] sign. Don't stop with a sign. The sign's
[1:44:16] only there to tell you keep
[1:44:19] going. I live in Groto, but I don't stop
[1:44:22] with a sign. I keep going. Come on,
[1:44:26] somebody. I'm in a message church, but I
[1:44:28] ain't stopping at a message church. I'm
[1:44:30] following the sign all the way to the
[1:44:33] end.
[1:44:35] [Applause]
[1:44:46] and he rolled the stone
[1:44:51] away. And because he rolled it away, 120
[1:44:53] gave life to
[1:44:56] 3,000. And 3,000 gave birth to
[1:45:01] millions. And here you are in this
[1:45:04] hour. If that resurrection has done
[1:45:07] this, what about this
[1:45:09] resurrection? Come on now.
[1:45:13] Are you going to accept what you've been
[1:45:14] raised for?
[1:45:20] I'm here at the rising of the sun. What
[1:45:23] are you saying? I'm saying the message
[1:45:25] changed
[1:45:26] me. I'm saying it was the rising of the
[1:45:29] sun, brother Stephen, that changed me.
[1:45:32] What was it? It was at the rising of the
[1:45:34] sun that Jacob got changed from Jacob a
[1:45:37] shyer to Israel. It was at the rising of
[1:45:41] the sun that he got his name
[1:45:43] changed. Come on, somebody. Peter went
[1:45:46] back to fishing. He went back to his
[1:45:48] livelihood. But it was at the rising of
[1:45:50] the sun that he saw Jesus on the shore.
[1:45:54] Come on, somebody. Joshua had some
[1:45:56] commandments. And on the seventh day, at
[1:45:58] the rising of the sun, the Bible says at
[1:46:01] the rising at the dawning of a new day,
[1:46:03] there be on the seventh day a people
[1:46:06] rise with a shout and walls fell at the
[1:46:09] rising of the sun.
[1:46:14] Hello. What's happening? It's a rising
[1:46:17] of the sun. I'll no longer call you
[1:46:20] church. I'll call you bride. It's a
[1:46:23] rising of the s
[1:46:26] Somebody give the Lord a hand. Clap of
[1:46:29] praise. If you love him, clap your
[1:46:34] hands. Come on, somebody. If you'll
[1:46:37] serve him, clap your
[1:46:39] hands. If you want to praise him, clap
[1:46:41] your
[1:46:43] hands. Let everything that is a part of
[1:46:46] this resurrection, praise the Lord.
[1:46:51] Let the musicians come.
[1:46:58] Hallelujah.
[1:47:07] Hallelujah. I'm done before my timer
[1:47:09] went off, so I know it didn't cookie
[1:47:10] goose
[1:47:13] today. I'm going to close with
[1:47:16] this. Were you
[1:47:18] separated from your first union by
[1:47:22] spiritual death?
[1:47:24] Now you are born again or remarried
[1:47:26] again to the new spiritual union of that
[1:47:30] your natural life of the things of this
[1:47:32] world but of eternal
[1:47:34] life. That germ that was in you at the
[1:47:37] beginning found you.
[1:47:41] That germ that was in you at the
[1:47:44] beginning found
[1:47:47] you. All that the father hath are mine.
[1:47:52] You couldn't come to him.
[1:47:55] But that gene that was in the beginning,
[1:47:58] it found
[1:48:00] you. Now your old book is
[1:48:03] gone with your old union. Now with your
[1:48:07] name in your old has been transferred.
[1:48:10] Now you say, "Do you mean to tell me
[1:48:12] that my old book that God put it in the
[1:48:16] sea of his forgetfulness?"
[1:48:20] You stand
[1:48:21] perfectly before God.
[1:48:27] That gene that was in you at the
[1:48:28] beginning,
[1:48:33] it found
[1:48:34] you. It found you.
[1:48:38] I once was dead,
[1:48:40] but I am
[1:48:41] alive forever
[1:48:44] more. What a resurrection that was.
[1:48:48] But what a resurrection this is.
[1:48:52] Hallelujah.
[1:48:55] Hallelujah.
[1:49:00] Hallelujah. Let's just bow our hearts
[1:49:02] before
[1:49:05] him.
[1:49:08] Father,
[1:49:11] Father, thou art
[1:49:13] ours. We have loved you.
[1:49:19] [Music]
[1:49:21] Lord, when it seemed like that all the
[1:49:24] world was just fading
[1:49:27] away, we fell so in love with
[1:49:30] you. We didn't even realize what was
[1:49:33] transpiring in our
[1:49:37] life. But God, there was a union that
[1:49:40] was taking place.
[1:49:43] Father, we are so honored to be a part
[1:49:46] of this
[1:49:47] resurrection. This message has taken us
[1:49:49] to higher
[1:49:51] heights. Father, the reason why we can
[1:49:55] recognize is because that we realize
[1:49:58] that you have deposited a seed. Brother
[1:50:01] Random would say that there the reason
[1:50:04] why that eagle that was down in that
[1:50:05] chicken bin, he recognized that
[1:50:09] scream was because there was something
[1:50:11] in him to recognize it with. Father, the
[1:50:15] reason why we could recognize the ego
[1:50:17] anointing over this age of death is
[1:50:20] because there's something there. So,
[1:50:22] Father, we turn and give you praise just
[1:50:24] now. This message has done Lord what the
[1:50:28] world could never do. It has turned our
[1:50:31] faith back to you. Father we glorify
[1:50:35] your name in Jesus name. Amen.
[1:50:40] [Music]
[1:50:52] me
[1:50:53] up in a
[1:51:00] prison and
[1:51:04] throw
[1:51:06] away the key.
[1:51:17] Take
[1:51:19] [Applause]
[1:51:20] away the
[1:51:26] vision from these
[1:51:30] eyes that
[1:51:33] now now can
[1:51:40] See, then
[1:51:44] deprive me
[1:51:47] of the
[1:51:51] food I eat.
[1:51:54] [Music]
[1:51:58] Even
[1:52:01] by my
[1:52:04] hands and my
[1:52:07] feet for as
[1:52:10] long as
[1:52:14] I know Jesus.
[1:52:21] He said that
[1:52:24] I could
[1:52:27] still go
[1:52:30] [Music]
[1:52:33] free. He said that
[1:52:37] I could
[1:52:40] still go free.
[1:52:43] [Music]
[1:52:47] Oh, tell me what
[1:52:51] kind of
[1:52:54] man would reach
[1:52:57] out his
[1:53:01] hand and do this for me.
[1:53:07] [Music]
[1:53:14] unworthy to
[1:53:17] live and not
[1:53:20] fear to
[1:53:23] keep a man
[1:53:27] on the cross.
[1:53:30] He put my name
[1:53:33] in his
[1:53:35] will and said that
[1:53:40] I could
[1:53:42] still go free.
[1:53:50] Now I
[1:53:53] never
[1:53:56] knew
[1:53:58] [Music]
[1:54:03] why a
[1:54:06] king would
[1:54:09] be his
[1:54:11] [Music]
[1:54:16] throne to dawn.
[1:54:19] on the
[1:54:20] [Music]
[1:54:22] road of an
[1:54:26] earthly
[1:54:28] man. And feel the
[1:54:32] pain of
[1:54:35] flesh, flesh and bone.
[1:54:39] [Music]
[1:54:43] into

[1:54:44] [Music]
[1:54:46] later tralary.
[1:54:50] [Music]
[1:55:09] But those
[1:55:11] blood red
[1:55:14] stains, they broke
[1:55:17] all my
[1:55:20] chains. He said that
[1:55:24] I I could
[1:55:27] still go free.
[1:55:34] He said that
[1:55:37] I I could
[1:55:40] still go
[1:55:43] [Music]
[1:55:46] free. Oh, tell me what
[1:55:51] kind of
[1:55:54] man would reach
[1:55:57] down his
[1:56:00] hand and do this for me.
[1:56:07] [Music]
[1:56:13] unworthy to
[1:56:16] live and not
[1:56:20] fit to keep.
[1:56:22] [Music]
[1:56:24] But a man
[1:56:26] on the
[1:56:28] cross. He put my name
[1:56:33] in his
[1:56:35] will and said that
[1:56:38] I I could
[1:56:42] still go
[1:56:45] free. Let's sing it
[1:56:48] again. He said that I
[1:56:54] Did you hear him when he spoke that to
[1:56:55] you?
[1:56:57] [Music]
[1:57:02] Oh, tell me what
[1:57:03] [Music]
[1:57:05] kind of
[1:57:08] man would reach
[1:57:11] down his
[1:57:14] hand and do this for me.
[1:57:21] [Music]
[1:57:27] unworthy to
[1:57:31] live and not
[1:57:34] fear to kill.
[1:57:37] put a man
[1:57:40] on the
[1:57:42] cross. He put my name
[1:57:47] in his
[1:57:49] will and said that
[1:57:53] I could
[1:57:56] see go
[1:58:02] free.
[1:58:05] [Music]
[1:58:13] Amazing

[1:58:22] sound that

[1:58:45] now I'm
[1:58:48] found. I was
[1:58:52] blind, but
[1:58:55] now I see.
[1:58:58] [Music]
[1:59:03] It was
[1:59:05] grace that
[1:59:09] taught my

[2:12:36] Please come
[2:12:39] back. High upon the
[2:12:42] mountain from where he
[2:12:46] ascended, the angel of the Lord declared
[2:12:50] that it would be. He said, "Don't stand
[2:12:55] here grieving for the one that you see
[2:12:59] leaving in like manners is coming back
[2:13:04] for you and me and
[2:13:07] me." And I believe he's coming back just
[2:13:12] like he
[2:13:15] said. I believe that the trumpet's going
[2:13:18] to sound so loud. going to resurrect the
[2:13:25] day in the twinkling of the
[2:13:29] night. He'll split that eastern sky. I
[2:13:34] believe he's coming back like you
[2:13:41] see. I believe the time is
[2:13:45] nearing that soon we'll see his
[2:13:48] appearing. This could be the very
[2:13:52] hour. Oh, this could be the
[2:13:56] day when saints from
[2:14:00] nation will lose their
[2:14:04] gravitation in the middle of the air
[2:14:09] called
[2:14:11] away. And I believe he's coming back
[2:14:16] just like you said.

[2:14:21] I believe that a trumpet's going to
[2:14:24] sound like going to resurrect the

[2:14:34] night is when that
[2:14:38] Easter I believe he's coming back
[2:14:43] like God bless you through Christmas.

[2:14:54] said. I believe that the trumpet's going
[2:14:57] to sound so loud. Going to resurrect the
[2:15:02] [Music]
[2:15:04] day in the twinkling of the
[2:15:08] night. He'll split that eastern sky. I
[2:15:13] believe he's coming back like he
[2:15:20] said. I believe the time is nearing that
[2:15:25] soon we'll see his appearing. This could
[2:15:29] be the very hour.
[2:15:33] Oh, this could be the
[2:15:36] day when the saints from every
[2:15:40] nation will lose their
[2:15:44] gravitation in the middle of the air to
[2:15:48] be called away.
