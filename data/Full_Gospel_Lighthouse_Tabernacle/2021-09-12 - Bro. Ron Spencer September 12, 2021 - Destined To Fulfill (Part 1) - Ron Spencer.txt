i would suffer defeat as a blackness of night it closed off the line my heart sank with fear and my desperate cry it rang out with fright and all i could see was no hope inside with my faith all but gone and i met that one who came up looking for me he came looking for me he came looking for me [Music] and he made a way where there was no way and that i could see [Music] and when i drifted far jesus was near he rescued my soul and he calmed all my fears now saved from my heart since i met that one he came looking for me i hope satan had already he picked out my grace his plan had moved forward to put me away i drifted so far would anyone care that i'd soon be lost but i knew my destruction it was a matter of time but jesus appeared he said this one's mine now i'm saved from my harm for he walked to that storm when he kept looking for me he came looking for me he came looking for me and he made a [Music] and when i drifted far yes jesus was near he rescued my soul and he calmed all my fears now saved from all since i met that one he came looking for me now oh satan he already picked out my grave his plan had moved forward to put me away i drifted so far would anyone care and i'd soon be lost or i knew my destruction it was a matter of time then jesus appeared he said this one's mine now save from my heart for he walked to that storm when he came looking for me he came looking for me he came looking for me and he made a way where there was no way that i could see and when i drifted far jesus was near he rescued my soul and he calmed all my fears now safe from my heart since i met that one he came looking for me [Music] and when i drifted far jesus was near he rescued my soul and he calmed all my fears now i'm safe from my heart since i met that one who came looking for me [Music] [Applause] hey man aren't you glad they came looking for you hey man sister allen she would come and then maybe your sister katie spencer and brother andrew come after them god bless you um you guys bear with me i want to give a little bit of a testimony um since may 15th um ananias had a knot on her neck about the size um between a nickel and a quarter that stuck out about the size of a dime when we first took her to the doctor they said that it was infection in the lymph nodes but everything else looked okay because it hadn't gone anywhere else we started her first round of antibiotics the end of may so from the end of may until still she's on an antibiotic and they've had to increase it um we found out that she had a bacterial infection called atypical tuberculosis they said it was just as it could have been just as common to that she had a a tiny scratch and we didn't know about it that got infected so we're thankful that it was everything was able to take care of there's another little boy at her school that had the same thing and their parents just decided that they're just going to let it run its course and do its own thing and um his busted and it's not so pretty um the doctor was we opted for surgery to try to get off the antibiotics so when he went in it was um it's super close to one of her nerves in her face and so he put a monitor on her mouth so that if he would get close to a nerve that it would go off and then he would stop so while she was in surgery and he was able to go in and remove most of the infection he saw that it had actually spread over to her saliva gland he wasn't able to get all of that off because of the angle that he had entered due to the nerve so we still have to continue on an antibiotic but we've got almost everything out [Music] he did not have to cut any of her skin away he was able to glue it back and we had prayed that she wouldn't have a scar and so with him being able to glue it back she only has one little spot that she may have a scar on because of the way that he was able to do it the color has gone back to flesh color and it's no longer pink and purple and while we were there we had to stay overnight because he did have to put a tube in to let the rest try to drain out and we had to share a room with a complete stranger it was really uncomfortable because the person that was staying there was a man and we could only have one person to stay with her and the lord moved that we were able to go get a private room so that we didn't have to share a room with somebody that was we didn't know or what would what would happen i know it sounds small but it was it was such a blessing to us and we're just thankful for all the prayers and the and the love and the cards and everything that you guys have shown to her and we're just so thankful and if you could just continue to pray that this round of antibiotics would just kill it usually they said that we had to see the the doctor above the ent and they said that without surgery this super strong medicine would be about a six month treatment since we opted for surgery the best case scenario is about a four to six weeks span and so we're just thanking the lord for that because they'll have if something if she has any of these side effects then they'll have to get her blood tested but since we opted for the surgery in such a short short treatment that we will probably not see she wouldn't have any side effects more than likely and so we're just so thankful for that and just continue to pray for her [Applause] when he walks among us and all that he does all of his mercy and all of his love if the pin of the rider could ride every day not even words could ever contain how i have been blessed warmth in the winter flowers in spring laughter of summer the a good place to sleep [Music] goes on my back and shoes on my feet i have been blessed [Music] is [Music] me no way i could count them there's not enough time so i'll just thank him for being stolen god has been good [Music] i have been [Music] arms that can raise a voice that can talk hands that can turn as they can see i've got to praise him as long as i breathe [Music] a mother and father nurtured and sisters and brothers memories [Music] tribes that can heal and bless [Music] i [Music] [Music] is [Music] there's not enough time so i'll just thank him for being so good god has been good [Music] i have been blessed we live in a country the greatest on earth our flag stands for [Music] liberty [Music] but some gave it all we could be blessed he's my shoulder to lean on i am down the rock where he leads me when i'm overwhelmed under his wings he's not just a song he's the reason i see i have been blessed [Music] is [Music] not enough time so i'll just thank him for being so kind god has been good [Music] so good i have been blessed [Applause] [Music] it's the old ship of zion it's the whole for the lost and the diet it's a soul saving station it's the time of salvation it's the church triumphant oh [Music] by the hand of the lord i'm talking about church in the book of revelation it's built on her eye got a firm foundation it's been through the flood it's been through the fire but one of these things the church is [Music] is it's the church the churches [Music] is is [Applause] is [Music] [Music] [Music]

so this is our 14th anniversary since the fire and um we i always look back to this day of or the the weekend that it's a special weekend satan did his best to destroy us and and we're still here but that weekend did some incredible things and and it brought our family into a new reality of of god's mercy and his grace and his power as i was speaking with brother tim this morning he reminded me he said i remember what your boys were like before the fire and he said i really like what they are after the fire amen so our trials bring us closer to the lord and so i'm thankful to to still be standing here with you and uh we're in another trial but uh we're going to win we're going to win and then so we have another scan this 22nd and we're just believing that that god can just be with us during that so glad to have the griffins with us and amen they have they have made some decisions to begin to be with us at least every other weekend and that's a tall task they drive about four hours to be here in every service so you make sure that you make them feel welcome amen we want to say how much we love you with all of our hearts and thank you for being here and man and your mother and

of one to grow on so i hope i've got a one to grow on amen so amen if you'll turn with me in your scriptures this morning i'd like to speak to you on destin to fulfill amen you remember last week and that i i i spoke to you about when jesus was saying there's some of you standing here you're going to see some phenomenal things you're going to see the kingdom come amen and i believe we can stand here and say some of you standing here you're going to see your loved ones walk down the aisle you're talking about a special sunday morning and we're going to be here together fellowshipping about 40 days i thought about a sister autumn was testifying what kind of services we're going to have when homer testifies to us brother wayne plays a guitar and we realize now the world they won't believe it no way you can tell the people on your job well this is happening at our church they're not going to believe it no way so about 40 days we're going to fellowship together knowing we're going to see the lord in the air this is not a fairy tale this isn't something a prophet said this is what jesus said and so we are here destined to fulfill the rapture's going to happen the resurrection is going to happen the end of the world is here we're watching it take place everything is going to fulfill the plan of god i'm just really thrilled i'm in it [Music] i'm really thrilled amen andrew used a couple of these texts last night and of course we don't compare on where we're going or what we even talk about as far as preaching so we just follow the mind of the lord but always like it how it happens matthew chapter 16 and verse 13. and when jesus came to the coast of caesarea philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that i the son of man am and they said some say thou art john the baptist some elias another jeremias or one of the prophets and he saith unto them but whom say ye that i am and simon peter answered and said thou art the christ the son of the living god and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and i say also unto thee that thou art peter upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it and i give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven amen maybe you have a need this morning you just like to lift your hand before the lord and god knows our hearts almighty god we love you with all of our hearts today we ask you to forgive us of our sins our mistakes failures of our humanity the thoughts that we have thought out of place words that we have may have said tempted to push in certain directions attitudes anything that would be wrong father but lord my heart's desire today is to have more of you living in my life and lord as we speak the words of eternal life i'm excited about what is coming forth today i ask you to anoint this audience i pray that you had blessed them in a mighty way and may it become very personal to them that your word is talking about us as living epistles today strengthen us bless the service touch every heart and every need in jesus christ's name we pray amen and amen you may be seated andrew was coming toward the end of his text last night and he read these scriptures in matthew chapters 5 and verse 3. remember who is saying these words god himself in the form of jesus christ now he's speaking to us in our humanity blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled i want you to just notice there's a blessing and there's a result for it blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see god [Music] blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of god blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven i like those results blessed are they when men shall revile you and persecute you and say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake now watch the response of this rejoice and be exceedingly glad for great is your reward in heaven for so they persecuted they the prophets which were before you now notice now he's laid all this foundational truth out year the salt of the earth but if the salt hath lost its savior wherewith shall it be salted it stents forth good for nothing but to be cast out and under the trot trodden under the foot of men ye are the light of the world a city that is set on a hill and cannot be hit neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a candlestick and it giveth light unto all that are in the house let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify the father which is in heaven amen and a man and a man and a man i know it's just just just for a few moments just lay out a few principles if you can just help me just just over the next little bit we know our god is an alpha and omega god he is the beginning and the end he is the first and the last it is more than a saying it is more than a saiyan the same god of the 1400s or the 1200s or the 800s or the 200s it's the god that's in control today are you with me he's not off on a journey somewhere another he is here to usher to fulfill this rapture to happen and let me just say he's not rapturing trees he's not rapturing boats cars building sanctuaries he's rapturing individuals that have the life that reflected inside of them as it is in him the same life the matching life and this life is not about 80 year olds it's about children where children can have the same life i remember as a child how god would deal with me as a child god's going to rapture children because every generation must have its own revival are you with me it's not about just the revivals past but it's about your own personal revival that will continue until the rapture when will we stop having problems the day of the rapture when will we stop having hard decisions the day of the rapture when will difficulties quit taking place to us the day of the rapture god will move you from this realm to that realm in the moment in the twinkling of an eye but while we are here we have a job to do we have a mandate we are commissioned to live this life more than pictures more than tapes more than knowing the the ins and outs of the doctrines more than being able to quote your bible all the way through many men can do that but can't make it live a lot of people have recipes of how it's supposed to happen are you with me but every one of us have a different revival in our lives and that fire you might try to explain it to somebody else but you can't explain a supernatural experience because god gives it to you individually so what we're doing here is we're reflecting where we're going to maybe you would go to busch gardens or to disney world and there was groups of people coming from everywhere and and you can kind of see what the world is like and you're standing there in your proper attire your proper dress your atmosphere don't change it don't change just because you're there and all of them around you your atmosphere don't change riding the same rides eating sometimes the same food not necessarily drinking the same drink but because you're headed to different worlds so many times we let that world vex us so much it'll aggravate our attitudes but remember keep your eyes on jesus [Music] this is not our home we're citizens of the united states or whatever nation that you're listening to it from your citizen and it's only temporary are you with me it's only temporary abraham was in search of a city whose builder and maker was god there's a reason that he continued that search is because he met the king and when you meet the king and that king changed his life can you imagine just for a moment living beside of abraham and his body changes i want you to just grasp this just somebody did somebody did i want to take that a little bit further somebody will i live on pine creek lane there are going to be witnesses the ups truck don't come there no longer the fedex truck don't come there no longer the mail people they're not picking up their mail they're going to witness that what we have preached about for these decades has happened you see god is producing kind after kind horses produce horses cows produce cows god produces god messiahs on the earth written epistles read and known of all men not just to live in a to a tent but to work in banks to work in hospitals to be chimney sweeps to work on your job it doesn't change your attitude or the way you conduct your business you're a christian on monday just like you're on sunday it isn't a put on anything make yourself do it it's just like breathing let me just say this if you're having difficulty living the christian life you need the holy ghost and let me just say it's for you ask continue to ask continue to wait continue to ask him refill my life fill me so much take the cares of the world the love of the world out of me just take those things that are not like jesus out of my life let me be so filled until i'm no i i just want to go home come to the place in your life that the comfort level of this world i want to go home so much i want to say this to you i want to say this to you very very as a pastor i want to say to be very clear your future is clear i want every individual in this building to think i i know i'm i'm on a different gear this morning but i want to talk to you as a father to a child or as a pastor to your sheep you'll fix your your future is clear carly you just got married the other day you stepped into a new lifestyle now you and adam serve the lord god's got big plans he's got big plans and you begin to realize that god has got a hold of this and he's making a way and sometimes you think the needs that you have in your life and sometimes so many times the world drives needs drives advertising and god's got everything in control while you were being formed in the womb god took care of it while you've worked through life he's opened doors in closed doors what he's done for you is open the door and sometimes in the opening of the door you got to leave somewhere i remember billy graham said the scripture said go into all the world and he said i realized to go i had to leave somewhere i thought that was a profound statement that was incredible statement as a messenger to sodom he had to go around the world just like our prophet did go around the world and he did a good job don't no never put him down he did a phenomenal job of what he did he was a tremendous man but remember this just as much as billy graham had a job to do you got a job to do who is the most important person of this church jesus is then jesus wants to live in every individual in this church not just the pastor not just the men not just the women not just the young people of this church [Applause] are you with me maybe you say well brother ron i've got old now and i just i just can't i don't move like i used to move but you pray like you've never prayed before you shake the kingdom of hell because you've got decades of experience behind you and with that experience and walk with god god has brought you through memorial after memorial after memorial but the job's not done yet you are destined to fulfill the word of god oh hallelujah now god knows what he's laid inside of you because he is the one that placed the potential of what you are to be and that potential is not temporary it's not a swiss watch even swiss watches go fast but let me just say this to you god's watching over the eternal part jesus was god made flesh but yet being god made flesh so many people didn't see it you are the word made flesh is this microphone working you are the word made flesh [Applause] you're the bible you're the message of the hour and maybe your friends will never read sermons like things that are to be where a prophet stands in this dimension and he stands there and he actually describes the vision of god for the bride of jesus christ and he says notice how those words are things that are to be not things that are maybe to be but it's a sure thing i love the book of revelations these are the true saiyans of god and let me just say god's never lied he's never lied let me let me just say this to you many times you watch me and i'm not just doing it just to show off my grandson or show off your children or show off miracles because there was a time before the miracle happened we were looking to the miracle [Applause] when david was crushed we were still looking to the miracle when whitney's womb could not bring forth we were still looking to the miracle but now there are two babies here we remind ourselves that it was god hallelujah brother ray was standing in the back of the building one day and he said the only pain that i want for for dressing the church up is is for autumn to get a real good husband she did there was a time we were looking to the miracle are you listening to me there was a time we were looking to the miracle ooh he's here there was a time we were looking to it but the miracle walked into our place and the miracle stood there and adonai has conceived and was a miracle in itself the same angel is visiting your house you can't stop the plan of god [Applause] jesus said i am the resurrection in life and he proved it i am the bread of life and he proved it i and my father are one and he proved it when he said i have finished the work in john chapter 17. he proved it when he told the woman go and sin no more i'm sure people were sitting there going yeah sure sure that's going to happen she was a harlot just last night but listen she met the man that wasn't a quick fix to her life she met the man that could change oh i feel like she fit the man that changed her life in a moment so we're not coming to a spot and then going back oh help me now we're not coming to a spot brother nathaniel and then running back we're not coming to a spot brother shannon and going back the horse was fine the chariot was fine the model t car was fine those old cars were fine but then come an airplane [Applause] hallelujah and then come the astronaut age there was a day that luther was fine and wesley was fine and pentecost was fine but god wasn't done unfolding his word there was people that were overcomers in every one of those revivals but god said i'm going to open the book and i'm going to have a people of the open book that'll take this word [Applause] brother edmund wade was sitting in the building brother brown just starts talking about him a little bit but brother edmund had a complex the complex caused him to fall dead if you'll notice brother branham didn't get excited listen to it he didn't get excited he got to calm the people because he had a future and he simply went over called him by his name and he come back to life there was a woman actually felt dead in the actually she was well but she fell dead in one of the meetings and brother branham was preaching and there's a commotion this woman's dead because she had a future follow me now he turned to billy paul he turned to billy paul and he said billy won't you go pray billy said has always scared the dead he actually told me that personally he says i was scared dead and he said no no daddy he said no pleb no daddy brother graham stepped out from the side of the platform and he and he called he said he didn't know her he said mary dead and she shut up yes brother brown well i don't know if i believe that or not dog why did it happen like that he had a future catch it now catch what i'm doing he had a future randall you have a future [Applause] now let me just let me just say two years brother random had that vision of that little finland boy it was in the fly leaf of thousands of bibles even brother branham's but brother have you heard what the critic said i could care less that little boy had a future as a matter of fact from that event brother branham's next stop was in finland and he was speaking and brother branham walks out into the building before he ever gets to the pulpit there were 12 rows of cots in wheelchairs 12 rows just get this 12 rows we just mentioned a couple of miracles and we get excited 12 rows of wheelchairs and cots and brother branham comes through the side door and he's not said a word yet and all of them get up don't you worry about the rapture don't you worry about the resurrection it will be right on time and all of them will get up they went down with anticipation with faith and they breathe their last breath listen their future was clear and they'll get up boy that's good isn't it you know the older i get the more gray i get my arms are becoming more white my legs are totally white ghost white because the cancer is affecting the pigments in my skin and they said that was the kind of thing that michael jackson had i don't want to go where michael jackson went now i want to just say these things real it was a it would be a waste of my time sister heather you do my hair it would be a waste of my time to figure how it's going to turn red again or how that i'm going to go from a 38 waist to a 30. now i could set go to school i could do a lot of things but i can't make that happen but abraham was believing what melchizedek said and he knew when melchizedek said is there anything too hard for the lord that god was not going to only heal his body but was going to heal sarah's body so if i'm in a situation i'm just keep coming to it so i just might as well say it i might as well if i'm in a situation like anna they said well they've seen a vision and i've been wanting a baby but i can't make myself have one i can't make myself do it there's going to come a rapture i can't put myself in the rapture but if we remember what mary said be it unto me according to thy word or like hattie wright said that's absolutely the truth brother branham the before she had rebellious boys the afterwards she had two eternal sons [Music] [Applause] hallelujah in luke 22 verse 31 and the lord said to simon simon behold satan had desired to have you i want to say that to you this is an audience he has an absolute desire to destroy your life and he would do it in a moment's notice if god didn't have your future in his hands hallelujah hallelujah but notice these next words but i have prayed for thee who better than to have god saying i'm concerned about my son satan's wanting to destroy him but i have interceded and he has a future hallelujah watch this quote satan tried every scheme to try to make him discredit this satan tried everything that he could to make him discredited he tried to make him to take the kingdom without suffering he tried to get him to take it without redemption this is jesus satan was trying to discredit him he'll try to discredit you let me just pause here just for a moment listen taking down these statues they're trying to get rid of the history whether you like it or not it's still the history you can take down all the statues you want to it's still the history and if you want to give them to somebody i'll take robert e lee i'll take him on his horse where are you going to put it i might even put him down here at the bottom of this church [Applause] listen i don't i don't say anything without meaning it because we have put a bid in on that statue i don't think we'll get it [Laughter] i don't think we'll get it there ain't no little horse that i bought this week but they tried to discredit brother branham they did that with luther they did that with wesley they did that with pentecost they did that with brother branham but notice they didn't do too much of it until he died then they want to change the bible go from a king james version to whatever version that they want go to a church where you want to live any kind of life you want to it shows that they have no future [Music] let me just say when you come to the bottom of a the bottom end of a wine jug there's no future in that your children are watching drinking beer and smoking and looking at all kind of pornography and fighting in the home all the time there's no future in that but there is a future in serving jesus christ where there's peace and there's joy and there's life i want to remind you there's no miracles without a mess we want to see miracles well first of all you got to have some messes and i i'd say there's probably 250 messes here for those on the internet we do not have a wing room where we hang our wings up [Laughter] we we are real people here this ain't a church where you want to slap somebody we still need more jesus you know what i mean you know what i mean we were masses [Music] don't get offended at that statement somebody asked me one time said how many guns is probably sitting in this church probably i just i just simply answered probably as many guns years as is bibles live in some liberal nation where you can't carry a gun move to america will you we'll take you you live in a debt you're at a dead church move here we're alive man we got life we enjoy serving the god i don't know if i can get a job there mcdonald's has got signs everywhere there are signs on every industry there are signs on every place don't you the reason you don't get a job here you just lord lord help me here i am isaac would have picked esau but god allowed him to be blind so he put him in a mess to fulfill the word of the lord listen jacob was destined to be the father of 12 tribes it was not esau that was to be the father of all of those it was jacob even in the womb god said i love jacob and i hate esau listen don't argue with god when he picked you he loved you god ain't mad at you and he ain't gonna beat you around the block he loved you he's loved you for centuries decades eternity [Applause] the memphis girl that was talked about last night already in my notes had to be blind that we could hear about her today the blind man in bombay india had to be blind and he's staggered in the and we roll these stories like shadrach meshach and abednego and daniel in a lion's den they were put in some real messes in their life but they were destined to fulfill what about a mexican baby that's been dead and the doctors tell her to go bury her dead and something's in her heart to get her her baby to that man that was praying for the sick last night and she don't stop at the first usher but she fights her way through every usher and finally comes before brother branham and then brother has another man to go pray for and in that action it calls division if you remember brother said i can't make myself have a vision no more than you can make yourself dream a dream but her faith caused a vision because that baby had a future are you with me now congressman upshaw had said in a lot of meetings being a real christian but today let's just do let's do it like this congressman nutshall being a christian his testimony was not effective as much as it could be if he was out of a wheelchair so he said in a meeting and it was a vision and he realized it was him and from that event he no longer needed a wheelchair or a walker but he began to walk and he stood on the on the on the steps of washington and told them what a miracle that was there and a prophet was in the land amen but he was in a mess for decades i'm driving something now your life may be a mess you may feel like you're surrounded by idiots i'm coming to your house your children may every one of them be unbelievers but there's something in your heart that's driving you it is because you're destined to fulfill something way higher than yourself now remember in a mess it's god's divine plan happening in your life [Music] sometimes he has to force us into the will of god stephen i find that absolutely amazing he has to force us into the will of god well brother i'm going to do a scriptural i'm going to need a scriptural okay joseph did not want to go to bethlehem to pay taxes because that's where that's where the scripture said he was going to be born at and so he wasn't just going to look at the scripture say well he's going to be born in bethlehem he couldn't put it all together he could not put the plan of god together hey i gotta move listen that would have been easy hey i gotta move but god got behind him and he caused governments to force him to go to the place of where he was born at to pay taxes don't mail him in move so he took his nine month pregnant wife and put her on a donkey and you hear brother branham talk about he talks so bad about that murderous king that was forcing him to pay taxes you're not the only ones fussed about your taxes it's scriptural [Music] some of you get it today some of you get it tomorrow some of you never get it he's pulling the donkey with his wife groaning and watching a star and all he could think about was taxes and god was forcing a move how many of you really like me and andrew being here matthew [Applause] i didn't want to move here i i didn't want to move here i was perfectly happy where i was at i was really happy i had a wonderful business don't worry god take care of that too i didn't want to move here i was happy evangelizing i was happy at work i was happy what i was doing and god showed me a vision of preaching at this church being a pastor of this church it didn't make me happy but brother on god showed you a vision that's right i find it amazing that sometimes god shows us vision of what our future is and we wrestle with it how many of you sisters have heard the truth through the years but you remember way back you remember way back then and you walked to your closet and you looked at it and said i got to keep them just in case i go back you walk to your music station this may be just a fad i'm going through i like that old time rock and roll kind of music just soothes am i coming to your house yet am i am i there and you know god's got plans so you find yourself moved to the home that you're going to be the rest of your life did you hear that the rest of your life and you find yourself moved and god blesses everything that you touch brother i'm afraid to step out by faith let me just say this to you you can't lose hey i was going to preach this for you is here anyway so here we are you can't lose walking with god enoch walk with god abraham walked with god i walk with god jacob walked with god brother branham walked with god you can't lose walking with god this young man has a desire to be in church every weekend right there he stands go ahead and keep standing has a desire to do you know that our state police is creating him a job because andrew was preaching and he said i have a desire to be in church every weekend i need a job monday through friday or monday through thursday would be even better don't worry god's created that job hallelujah don't you wear it if he can cause governments to create taxes to make joseph to move now i'm preaching to you he's the god of your life and you're a written epistle read and known there's a lot of pages left in your life i'm preaching by faith i got a lot of pages left in my life satan has wrote i was gonna die a year ago but i'll stick i still got some pages left i got some preaching to do hallelujah [Applause] don't sit down now i'm done i'm gonna save it till next week hallelujah why don't you just start raising your hand and say i got life to live [Applause] god's not done with me yet oh glory god can only use what you surrendered to him why don't you surrender your whole life maybe you've left some out over the last bit but won't you surrender your whole life to him hallelujah hallelujah oh what a moment oh what a moment how long's it take brother ron brother branham was sitting with ed biskell on a log and it took just a moment to change his future forever it was settled young people it this isn't some special recipe what you sung last night and how god moved in your life last i watched it how god moved in your life the devil didn't do that god did that for you this may be the start but there's a whole lot of more pages left in your life hallelujah last night when you sung this is she it was more than a song it's more than words but what you were singing is i'm a part of this the rapture can't happen without me brother bill you and i have danced up and down the aisles and last week when i watched you dance that wasn't your last dance so don't let the devil say you're finished it's over with there's a lot of dances left on the pages of your book brother ray when i think about god's got my future i just can't help just get all excited i just i can't help but listen i don't even have my future god's got it god's got it now they've explained they've explained this to me they said no the tumors that you have one's about this big one's about this big in your brain and so what what could happen is as they get so big they're kind of like a big blood spot and they're packed they're packed with cancer and and what they do is they get so big until eventually they bust you probably just slip away in your sleep now you know i could live with that thing tormenting me every day or i could read the book and the book says i'm going to be in saskatoon in a few weeks and the book says that i'm going to be in louisiana in a few weeks i might as well speak it and i'm going on the hunt and dripping on a goody about buck about that size and because the book said so i'm going to enjoy tomorrow this afternoon i'm going to enjoy tuesday when it gets here and i'm going to enjoy wednesday when it gets here why don't you just enjoy it with me cause ain't nobody can live your life like you can live it so why don't you just go ahead and be happy happy happy happy happy cause god's bigger than our problems he's bigger than our situation he's bigger than our troubles he's got the whole world in his hands don't you just put your hands out there sister katie he's got the whole world in his hands and your world is right there and he's taking care of it and he's got everything in his hands oh i'm to be a mama i'm to be a wife i better put wife first i'm to be a wife and i'm these hands that i've got in front of me are going to hold a baby anna [Music] you see i've got a call this week [Music] andrew tuster and his wife had been desiring a baby for years years and couldn't have one [Music] and i walked by him about two years ago and take him back [Music] brother jim as i walked by him i said god's remembering you he's coming he called me this week and he said brother ron i wanted you he said my family now knows he said i wasn't going to tell you first because i knew you'd tell the world [Music] he was right he'd be good when the angel comes by your house and what you have been dreaming for hoping for desiring for all the sudden you're holding it [Music] don't you know there was a day that abraham enjoyed walking beside of isaac [Music] a hundred years old and he dreamed and he hoped and he wished his whole destiny of his life [Music] was to have a son because god said i'll make you the father of nations but he couldn't be the father of nations on his own he needed to help a god [Music] after a while he wasn't wishing for it he wasn't pleading for it he was enjoying it he was [Music] you witnessed angels last week won't you walk with them [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] there come a time that he wasn't wishing for a little boy no more but he was walking with him isaac i know you i know you don't know nothing about a gray-headed old man but there came a time isaac [Music] that god came to my tent and i was grey-headed and my shoulders were stooped and i was getting to where isaac that i couldn't hardly walk and the king of salem was at my tent and sarah was doubting
