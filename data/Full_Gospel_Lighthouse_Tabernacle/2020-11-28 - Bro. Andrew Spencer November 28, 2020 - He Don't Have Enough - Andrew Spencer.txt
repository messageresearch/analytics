we've got very much to be thankful for and grateful for and appreciative to have air in our lungs to be able to worship a true and living god to worship him in spirit and in truth we've got more than we could ever ask for to thank him for and he's been better than good to us and we just want to express our our love to him and and i hope you all had a wonderful thanksgiving and you know i don't think that thanksgiving should just be one day a year it should be every day we ought to be thankful every day for all the things that he's done for us and and uh certainly thankful for what the lord has done for our pastor over the past year and it seems like we we we conquer we conquer one giant another giant just pops his head up and and i want to assure you full gospel lighthouse god still loves you and he's on your side and we're going to win this thing we're going to win this thing full victory not half victory god don't make god don't make halfway christians and god don't do halfway victories we're going to come we're going to come out of this thing and we're going to shout we're going to testify we're going to praise the lord and and during all of that we're going to do some praying and god knows what he's doing to keep us on our knees and so we're certainly remembering our pastor this evening and it's just a stinking devil that we're facing but we know whose side we're on amen amen if you have your bibles this evening we'll turn over in a book first samuel chapter 17 and verse 32 i pray you bear with me this evening the lord dropped his heart this thought on my heart ten minutes before i walked out so as i've said before this be like riding a new horse but i found that when god says something he's already confirmed confirmed it to me but i pray that he would confirm it to you tonight i'd like to speak to you on he don't have enough he don't have enough first samuel chapter 17 and verse 32 if you found your place there i just wanted to share some news with you we we had you praying for brother roger saylor and uh he called me last weekend before service and was just relaying some things to us there and brother roger had found a lump on his on his chest area here and it caused him uh quite concerned and the doctors as well and so they were they were doing they were going to do a mammogram thinking that thinking most likely it was cancer and so on monday monday as you know brother roger had to test and they could not find no cancer hallelujah brother roger i believe brother roger did a little shouting right there in the parking lot he started speaking in tongues while i had him on the phone with me and uh you know we thank the lord you know we say well it wasn't there to begin with well maybe it was or maybe it wasn't but all i know is that god's a winner and cancer can't even hold one of us it can't hold and they cannot stand before believers prayer god knows and i want to say to you tonight you may hear me say it a few times but satan don't have enough they don't have enough first samuel chapter 17 and verse 32 and david said to saul let no man's heart fail because of him thy servant will go and fight with this philistine and saul said to david thou are not able to go against this philistine to fight with him for thou art but a youth and he a man of war from his youth and david said unto saul thy servant kept his father's sheep and there came a lion and a bear and took a lamb out of the flock and i went out after him and smote him and delivered it out of his mouth and when he arose against me i caught him by his beard and smote him and slew him thy servants slew both the lion and the bear and this uncircumcised philistine shall be as one of them seeing he hath defied the armies of the living god let's go to prayer this evening father we come before you tonight lord we humble ourself before you lord we bow our heads to the dust of the earth from which we came father lord you know the sixteen elements lord that you have created father and lord we are built for a purpose lord jesus and lord you know the things that have that have come up through the dna lord of our history but father i believe that there is a blood that cleanses all of our sins our mistakes and our failures and father we stand here tonight as we unite our faith together lord on behalf of our pastor brother ron lord he is constantly under attack and one might ask how much can a body take but father we're reminded that you paid a price at calvary that you were wounded for our transgressions you were bruised for our iniquities and the chastisement of our peace was upon you and by his stripes we are healed father we stand and believe that all of those stripes were not taken in vain this evening we believe father that when you went there to take those stripes you took them for our pastor you took them for our loved ones you took them for one of each and every one of us here tonight and we stand here upon the bases of your word father that you will not change and you will not you will not move off of your promises father and i pray lord that the angel of the lord would be so real father here that you would make yourself visible to us in this audience but not only here in that hospital room at uva father i pray that you would slip into the room just now maybe unawares to doctors may be unawares to even brother on but i pray the angel of healing would slip into the room father and i would like to remind the enemy tonight that he does not have enough to stop god's promises and i pray that you would show forth your power tonight and a display like you can only do we glorify the god of heaven and we bless your holy name and the church of god says amen god bless you you may be seated this evening as we continue on with our scripture reading the verse 37 and david said moreover the lord that delivered me out of the paw of the lion and out of the paul of the bear he will deliver me out of the hand of the philistine notice david's confidence in the god that he served that the lord that delivered me he didn't put the credit upon himself when he went out with the line he didn't put the credit upon himself when he went out against the bear but he put the credit to where credit was due and he showed that that david was was a very strong believer in god's promises that that this god will deliver me out of the hand of this philistine and saul said unto david go and the lord be with me and saw armed david with his armor and he put a helmet of brass upon him and also also he armed him with a coat of mail and david girded his sword upon his armor and he assayed to go for he had not proved it and david said unto saul i cannot go with these for i have not proved them and david put them off of him and he took his staff in his hand and he chose him he chose him five smooth stones out of the brook and put him in a shepherd's bag which he had in his script and his sling was in his hand and he drew new near to this philistine brother matthew if you'll go and look on my desk there's a sling there and i might need it tonight and the philistine came on and drew near unto david and the man that bear the shield went before him and when the philistine looked about and saw david now could you imagine as as goliath looks down he's looked out upon many uh warriors that's come out to face him but could you imagine how how goliath looked upon this little boy as david drew near david drew near drew near to david and the man that bear the shear went before him and the philistine looked about and saw david he disdained him for he was but a youth and ruddy and of a fair countenance and the philistine said unto david am i a dog that thou cometh to me with staves and the philistine cursed david by his gods well it didn't do no good and the philistines said the david come to me and i will give thy flesh under the fowls of the air and to the beast of the field then said david to the philistine thou comest to me with a sword and with a spear and with a shield but i come to thee in the name of the lord of hosts the god of the armies of israel whom thou has to fight this day will the lord deliver thee into my hand and i will smite thee and take thine hand from thee thy head from thee and i will give the carcasses of the host of the philistines this day under the fowls of the air and to the beast of the field that all the earth may know that there is a god in israel and i want you to read this with me and all this assembly shall know that the lord god that the lord saveth not with sword and with spear for the battle is the lord's and he will give you into our hands why don't you give the lord a handclap of praise i want to remind you that satan ain't got enough and the enemy may curse you with his gods but he ain't got enough and we realize that we are in a battle for life we're in a battle for heavenly places and the prophet would tell us that there are that we are facing two powers and one of those powers is god's and the other is satan but that's why paul would tell us in in ephesians chapter 6 and 10 finally my brethren be strong in the lord and in the power of his might and put on the whole arm of god that you might be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against rulers against powers against rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole arm of god that you might be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand now you're not going to be able to stand against this enemy just facing him on your own you're not going to be able to stand out there in your emotion and whip this devil and face this devil we are facing a devil that has been against us for 6 000 years he studied our dna he knows what you're made of he knows what's in your history but you are not going to be able to stand against this devil and come against him with all of his power and all of his authority which is nothing but a bluff and a lie but you're not going to be able to overcome this enemy by just standing in yourself but if you can wrap yourself in the whole armor of god if you can get yourself so enveloped in the power of the blood of jesus christ that your life is no longer your own but you're standing there in the blood of jesus christ that even if a mosquito come and lays hands on you and bites you that they'll go away singing that there's power in the blood i pray that you this evening would get so enveloped in the power of the blood of jesus christ that the enemy that when he gets close to you that he has to run for cover because the blood is against him the blood is against him and he never had enough at calvary to stop jesus and he ain't got enough now to stop jesus and he ain't got enough now to stop me he ain't got enough now to stop you and he ain't got enough now to stop the bride of jesus christ he ain't got enough now the prophet would tell us about that back in the day when the indians when they would have a contest that they would have a contest of strength and they would have a tug of war and they would put they would put a fire out in between those two and they would try to pull that losing party into that fire and brother branham would say that there is a contest between satan and the church of the living god and that those fires that satan has created that you are to pull satan into those fires that he created and it's going to show who's got the most power you are satan but i want to tell satan you ain't got enough you can build your fires you can say what you'd want to you can make up your lies you can say you're going to kill us but you ain't got enough you can say you're going to make us sick but you ain't got enough you can say you got power but you ain't got enough you can say you're gonna stop a rapture but you ain't got enough hallelujah we know who's got the most power so who's in control of all this god or satan you see satan has always tried to stop the move of god and always tried to stop the people of god of believing in god you'll notice the very first thing that satan did in the garden of eden was that he caused unbelief to enter in and cause reason but we know that he's always tried to stop the belief in god because you see when you go to believe in what god says it'll stop the enemy's plans you see that's what he's trying to get you disrupted about this weekend is he's trying to stop you from believing in what god has said but god's got a voice that is going to break through the darkness he's got a voice that'll break through the storm he's got a voice that'll bring dead people back to life [Applause] so we realize that satan has tactics but his tactics are never successful but he's always trying to trying to take away from the power he's trying to take away from that word you see if satan can make you feel like the weapon that you're fighting against him with is inadequate he's got you whipped right there is that right he's got you whipped when he makes you feel like you're like you're like the word that you're fighting with is not good enough well you see the armor that you're fighting with is strong enough the word that you're fighting with is strong enough but brother random would say that it's the hand of faith that holds that sword you see now when you take that sword into your hand and you hold it in your hand and you're holding it there with a sword with a power of faith behind it brother branham would tell us that when two omnipotents meet that the miraculous has got to take place and when your faith in an omnipotent god and the promises of omnipotent god meet together that the promises of god the miraculous has to happen and satan ain't got enough to stop it now remember this that christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts but the book of revelations shows how that the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it and making it lukewarm and formal and powerless it exposes satan and revealing his works attempted destruction of god's people and the discrediting of god's word right down to the time that he's cast into the lake of fire he fights that he cannot stand it because he knows that if if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for that she can do the greater works and she will be an invincible army you see he knows that if you get a hold of this revelation you know goliath didn't know what he was getting into that day but satan has been against this army for quite some time and he knows that if you get the true revelation if you grab ahold of a rock of revelation he knows what's coming for his head he's heard the sound of this thing before and he knows that when the people of god go to grabbing a hold of their sling and go to grabbing a hold of the promises of god that if they go to cutting it loose in a hand of faith that he ain't got enough to stop that rock of revelation even jesus would say that the gates of hell would not prevail against this revelation so he knows that if you get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for that she can do the greater works and that she will be invincible that means that you're too powerful to be defeated that's why paul would tell us to fight the good fight of faith and to lay hold onto that lay hold on to eternal life you see because you'll be invincible if you lay a hold on these promises you'll be too powerful to be defeated you see he's always trying to tell you that you're never going to win but i got bad news for the devil the battle has already been won goliath didn't know it but 40 days before he ever started there was a little boy that had already been anointed that was already on his way and he didn't have enough to stop david from coming he boasted for 40 days 39 days 38 days and on down to the one day till david showed up it's a bad day for the devil because there have been some davids that have showed up in this hour that's not gonna put up with the devil's boast anymore goliath may have woke up and he may ate his wheaties but his wheaties didn't give enough power to stop this david you can eat your old meal you can eat your you can eat your th hm you can eat anything you want to but you d wasn't going to eat enough to stop this david he boasted for 40 days and the bible said that there came out a champion he'd been a champion before he'd been a champion over many people before and he sent out his voice of condemnation don't all of you come out here and fight me just send me one down here you see the enemy sent out his voice and notice what the enemy's voice did it sent fear through the camp of israel that everybody that was on the winning side was shaken everybody that was on the side that was going to come out victorious was over here trembling because they were looking down into a valley where there was a man that was standing so much tall he was standing head and he was standing way above everybody else had a head that looked like a bathtub and they were all fearful because of this man making his boast notice how powerful fear is fear stopped and whole army of israel from going down into a valley and taking what was rightfully theirs you see if they would have only realized what abraham had been spoken what abraham had told and what moses had prophesied if they'd only looked back in the scripture and look when the armies of israel had been outnumbered before they would join they would join their faith together with one another and they would walk down into that valley unafraid you see god sometimes will take you into a valley when nobody else wants to stand there with you god will take you into a valley when everybody else is just standing behind you saying you ain't good enough he'll make you walk out into a valley when everybody's behind you and they're grumbling and complaining that you're too little that you're not big enough that you're not strong enough but god's got a plan in sending a david down into a valley you might walk down into that valley but i want you to know don't you walk down there in fear if god has purposed a valley for you satan ain't got enough he ain't got enough to stop you in that valley [Applause] oh hallelujah let me say it to you like this cancer ain't got enough to stop brother on he may have walked down into that valley but the children of israel is not like that day the children of israel is right behind brother ron you can do it you can win you can overcome cancer you ain't got enough sickness you ain't got enough hell you ain't got enough hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah that voice fell on the wrong ears i pray that that voice falls on some of your ears what's he whispering in your ear tonight what's he lying to you about what's he telling you you're too small david was told he was too small david was told he was not big enough david was told that he was but nothing but a roof a ruddy little fella nothing but a youth do you think that shocked david he knew he wouldn't be 12 years old he knew he was ruddy he knew that he had a fair countenance he knew he'd just been out there in a shepherd wake up i know where i've been at i know what i've been doing but you don't know what i've been doing on the back side of that desert back there i've been singing back there i've been praying back there i got anointed back there i met god back there i killed a lion back there i killed a bear oh hallelujah tell me something i don't know i know i'm too small i know i'm too loud i know i dance too much i know i shout too much but you don't know what i was doing in the back room you don't know what i was doing in my closet you don't know what i was doing hallelujah tell me something new they could measure david but they could not measure what was on the inside of him it wasn't even heart it was god oh hallelujah they talk about these david and goliath ball teams they had something that they couldn't measure they had heart that couldn't be wrote down on the paper david had something more than hard david had a god that was on the inside of him david had a god that would come and anoint him and he would go and he didn't have the baptism of the holy ghost david would have an affair but you stand here as a son and daughter of god fully baptized robed in his righteousness if david could stand there and get so anointed that he would condemn the voice of hell what should you do today if david would scream out you ain't got enough what should you say are you with me hallelujah saul said you can't fight him you're no warrior and he's a warrior from his youth but david started pointing him back to some trophies that he had there's been some voices in your life mother nathan has told you that you'll never make it but pointing back to some trophies little bride there's been some people said you ain't gonna make it but i want you to point them back to some trophies i want you to point them back to that line that line of depression that they said you never get over that line of medicine that they said you never get off of i want you to point them back to that bear of anxiety that they said you deal with for the rest of your life i want you to point them back to that bear of alcoholism that they told you that you never overcome i want you to point them back to them drugs to bear them drugs and say hey i know i know what i was i know what i got back there in my tent there was some drugs that said i wasn't going to make it but i got some drugs held up as a trophy that i'm strong enough i'm good enough i'm qualified enough i'm cold enough i'm elected enough point them back to them trophies where the devil said you wasn't good enough point them back to them trophies and remind the enemy who you are you ain't got no right to be ashamed of who you are and sometimes your family history here on earth might make you ashamed or where or what they're doing the things that they do and it might make you embarrassed by the things that they say but you ain't got nothing to be ashamed of as a son and daughter of god i can point back in my family history i can point you back to moonshiners i can put you back to bootleggers i can point you back to a bunch of nonsense sure that might make me ashamed but all it tells me is that there is a blood oh hallelujah though satan may have thought that i was destined for hell he didn't have enough hallelujah you imagine can you imagine what goliath thought when this little ruddy looking boy walked out there and he started picking up stones he didn't just pick up any stones but the prophet said that he picked up five he picked up faith he picked up jesus he picked up grace can you imagine how goliath felt when he walked out there and that little boy just starts picking up stones now goliath has watched many people walk out and fight him before and he's seen him walk out there with a sword he's seen him walk out there with a spear but they ain't never seen he never seen anything like this and i can imagine that david as he's picking up jesus down here as he's picking up jesus up off the ground you see he knew that he only needed one for goliath but he needed four more for his brothers and i can imagine as goliath is watching this take place and goliath say what are you going to do with those i can hear david say wait and see wait and see what are you going to do with that message wait and see what are you going to do with that revelation wait and see oh it may look like a little bitty rock but don't let no giant stand up here tonight you let a giant stand up in this full gospel lighthouse tonight i got half a mind to sling his rock right at him go ahead [Music] wait and see what i do with it you say well hey what are you doing down there this weekend you know that good and well that you're gonna go out and get drunk again next weekend wait and see what i do with this weekend that ain't my testimony let it be your

looking at you and saying you know you know he ain't living right you know she ain't living right you wait and see what happens this weekend you wait and see what happens this weekend hell thought that he would disrupt god's plan but when hell thinks it's going to disrupt god's plan it's only a setup it's only a setup for god to have an opportunity to get a blessing and work a miracle and he ain't got enough to stop it you say brother andrew you act like you're mad i am mad i am mad i'm mad at the devil we ought to get so stinking mad our worship has been disrupted for the past year our praise has been disrupted for the past year our pastor has been afflicted for the past year it ought to make you mad it ought to make you so stinking mad at the devil that you want to pick up a stone and cut his head off it ought to make you mad that he didn't let you worship the way you wanted to worship but it didn't stop you from worship because he ain't got enough [Applause] he didn't stop you from praying because he ain't got enough he didn't stop you from getting here because he ain't got enough if it had enough he'd abroad enough little as much if god is in it hallelujah these weren't just ordinary rocks these rocks have been rained down from heaven you remember that history tells us that those rocks that were laying there in that valley had come from another world that when joshua and joshua chapter 10 when he stopped the sun when he was fighting his enemy that the bible said that the lord rained down hailstones and that more died with hailstones than it did with the edge of the sword history tells us that these rocks that came out of this valley was the same rocks that had rained down from heaven this that which you are fighting with did not come from jeffersonville it came from glory hallelujah hell there's going to be a lot of people get mad at this but i don't get my substance and i don't get my material from jeffersonville i get my substance and my material from glory these rocks didn't come from a kentucky preacher these rocks came from god he just used a kentucky preacher to let loose these rocks what will he do today will he use an elkton boy will he use a grotto's girl will he use a richmond girl to let loose of these rocks these rocks which are fighting with they come from another world and satan ain't got enough to stop him he ain't got enough power to stop just go ahead and put it in there go ahead what would brother ron say where's that cat i'd say if brother ron could speak some words to you he would say stay steady stay steady and slay your enemy oh church of the living god you had everything to stay steady on you got the promises of god these promises have been they they've been proven before they've been proven before that if you lay hands on the sick they shall recover they've been proven before it's been proven before that if you were baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ for the remissions of your sins that you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost that promise has been proven hallelujah these rocks that you're fighting with they're not ordinary rocks they got jesus spelled all over them you know maybe it didn't happen maybe it didn't happen to goliath but i pray that i so get a hold of a rock of revelation this evening that it would have my initials attached to it who did that to my number one demon andrew lee spencer what about you who's willing to stand up and say you know what i'm gonna grab that stone and i'm gonna fight with it i'm gonna grab him promises and i'm gonna go to battle with it well i got some i got some guys that'll go with me come on down here these guys are wanting to go with me you ain't gotta put your mask on ain't nobody else gonna come up here these guys is willing to go with me these guys is willing to take one of these rocks these guys is willing to fight i just believe there's a whole lot more setting here that was willing to stand up they willing to stand up for the children they willing to stand up for their pastor they're willing to stand up for their church they're willing to stand up for their god-given rights [Applause] thank you i believe that if i could look around and you could say it that you would say satan ain't got enough to stop you i want you to say it from your lips satan ain't got enough to stop me he ain't got enough to stop me these rocks have worked before these rocks have worked before when you look over in second kings chapter three and they went down there and elijah told them go down there and make those valleys full of ditches dig out them ditches brother random said if you hit a tin can get it out the way if sin is in your way get it out your way hallelujah but they said that you are going to fill that valley full of water there was a promise coming that the valley would be full of water and you would have victory i love what the bible said is that they took up stones and they stopped up their well and they marred every good piece of their land they took these same stones and they shut up the whales of the enemy oh i hear a prophet say you take a rock of testimony and you shut up that co-formal testimony of that whale that the enemy is trying to choke you out with stomp it up stop up that well that's trying to tell you that you're not good enough you can be seated stop up that well of fear scare the covet stop that well up you say you're out reaching here a little bit i'm going to give the devil a a what do we call that i come around and you just elbow him right in the mouth scare to covet yes i understand that we have people sitting here that are over the age of 70 and that are susceptible to getting sick what about the flu what about a cold do not allow a name by the name of covet maybe i could spell it out for you in a different way d-e-m-o-n don't allow a d-e-n-o-n to stop you from moving into your promises who is controlling who here it's time that you take the rock of god's promises and you stop up that whale of fear stop up doubt stop up depression stop up that well of cigarettes stop up that well well it's just not going to happen for me stop that well up it is going to happen for you and if you keep talking like a loser you'll be a loser but the bible said as a man thinketh in his heart so is he if you're going to be a winner you got to talk like a winner if you're gonna be an overcomer you're gonna act like an overcomer satan ain't got enough to a positive attitude that'll take the right word of god and put it right back in the enemy's face i got a right brother burnham would say you take that token and you shake it in front of satan you ain't got a right to be here you're too ragged you're too poor you're not good enough you ain't got a good enough education take that thing and shake it in front of the enemy hallelujah shake it in front of satan is that a direct quote brother william that's a direct quote shake it in front of satan take your token and shake it in front of satan direct quote he said you've got a right he said if the pilot tries to keep you off the plane you got a right all you got to do is show him your token if the engineer tries to keep you off the train you got a right to be there because the token's already been paid for hallelujah brother branham said i got a right just like paul's got to write you got a right to the baptism of the holy ghost as much as anybody else has got a right to it and satan ain't got enough to stop you from getting it he didn't have enough he didn't have enough when moses come down through there and they put him down into a rocket dog a crocodile-infested river it didn't have enough to stop him i know that rocket i'll make the blooper trail but you'll be okay i know what i've said but he didn't have enough and i probably ain't got enough to stop that blooper blooper video either my children will make that when i'm 80 years old and say look what daddy said but moses had a promise of god that was hanging over top of him and satan didn't have enough to stop him they killed all the other two-year-olds and they tried to kill everybody out just the same way that they did when jesus was on earth but they didn't stop moses from growing up in the enemy's camp you can try all you want to you can knock me down all you want to but i'm going to get back up [Applause] they tried to throw daniel in the lion's den but they didn't have enough when the angels showed up are you with me they tried to throw the three hebrew children into a fire but the fire didn't have enough to burn them when they come out on the other side they come out and they didn't even smell like smoke i'd say to the church of the living god when we come out we're not coming out smelling like leodaceae we're coming out smelling like heaven oh set a fire down in my soul [Applause] they tried to stop david but they didn't have enough oh hallelujah they tried to stop jesus and they didn't have enough the grave didn't have enough hell didn't have enough death didn't have enough all the demons in hell didn't have enough but jesus did have enough [Applause] they tried to stop this bride but they didn't have enough you say he gave you the greatest weapon when he gave you his word if he could have give you something better he would have but he gave you a weapon that will whip the devil anytime any place under any circumstance it's enough sister sarah it's enough sister joanne what he's given you brother jim it's enough it's enough when you go into your next trial i want you to say that god's already given me enough when you're in the middle of your trial won't you say god's already given me enough when you coming out of your trial you can say god has gave me enough oh hallelujah you see he gave you his own name they tried to tell the disciples do not they condemn them from teaching in the name of jesus they tried to stop them from teaching in his own name but they didn't have enough how could you stop a man that had been blind and tell him that he could not see no more you're telling me that i can't see when i'm describing everything about you how can you tell somebody that's been made full of the quickening power of jesus christ that they need to sit down and shut up you can't do it they didn't have enough and the bible said in acts chapter 3 that when they walked in there and there was a crippled man laying there by the beautiful gate that peter and john looked on him and said silver and gold have i none but such as i have give out thee in the name of jesus christ and they tried their best to stop them from preaching but the bible said that they took knowledge that they had been with jesus i'd say that there's some demons running for cover tonight because there's a people that have been recognized that they've been with jesus and those demons are running back down to hell and they're saying satan i don't know what kind of weapon you sent us up there with but it wasn't enough you're gonna have to give us something better than that [Applause] oh man oh man that's too much fun they ain't got enough they ain't got enough you remember the quote brother brandon brother andrew brother ron excuse me read to you about the little boy finless there little finish boy there's been a lot of critics that rise up and say that that didn't happen but were they there no but two years before that boy ever got hit by that car there was a prophet on the other side of the ocean that had seen him in that car wreck and that car was used as a weapon to kill that boy that boy was laying there and his legs sticking through his socks looked completely hopeless but death didn't have enough to stop the vision from coming to pass brother branham would say that you could line up every default and it wouldn't have stopped that vision from happening it wouldn't have stopped it because you see if he would have had enough he'd abroad enough but he didn't have enough so we couldn't bring him and neither can he bring enough to stop the armies of the living god you're not packing your own name tonight you're packing the greatest name that's ever been named the name of jesus christ is high above every other name that every knee should bow and every tongue shall confess that jesus christ is lord demons have to bail hell has to bow cancer has to bail sickness has to bow covet has to bow in the presence of the name of jesus christ hell ain't got enough hallelujah the fbi said that they were going to expose this message but they didn't have enough because it wasn't the fbi it was too backslid preachers a maniac in portland said that he was going to stop this preacher from standing there and he was going to expose him caught him a snake in the grass spit in his face but he didn't have enough he said tonight you'll fall over my feet and that demon screamed out i'll show you whose feet you're going to fall over you see he'd made all of his threats he made all of his boats but when that little prophet rolled back his shoulder he said it come out of me he said the scripture said take no thought for what you're saying he said i heard myself saying those words he said that man fell over top of his feet and he said is that man delivered they said he said no that man worships that spirit he said but you can roll him off my feet i'm gonna help brother ron tonight hey some demons trying to pin his feet to the floor but i'ma roll him demons off of his feet hell ain't got enough heart attacks ain't got enough cancer ain't got enough the least you could do is help him roll it off of his feet the least you can do is pray and roll him off of his feet the least you could do is help shout that wall down and roll him off of his feet the least you could do is pray to an almighty god and roll that demon right out of his life that's trying to choke him out and kill him [Applause] he ain't got enough sister connie i want to tell you you're listening but i want to tell you hell ain't got enough hallelujah prophet said now now i was saying now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen and he said as i said that he said a man in a wheelchair jumped up out of that wheelchair a woman on a cot jumped out of that stretcher and this one jumped up and that one jumped up he said what was it he said when that is when those armies of demon had watched the chief tribe of the devils after he watched him as he had been defeated they all had to leave everybody walked out of there healed i want to remind hell the chief tribe of the demons of hell didn't have enough that night and they ain't got enough tonight you can try to choke us out you can try to prop us and stop us out but you ain't got enough hallelujah the prophet would say be fearless in your testimony and i'm going to leave you with these words and we'll bring these words to you in the morning this body must obey its confession as the musicians come this body must obey its confession and hell don't have enough i told brother ron as he was headed to the hospital this evening i said brother on that angel the lord is listening and he's real close and he said you're absolutely right i said he's listening to what you say i'll pick it up in the morning this body must obey its confession stand with me this evening we've got the power oh in the name of jesus we've got the power it's in the name of the lord and though satan rages we will not be defeated we've got the power it's in the name of the lord when we've got the power
