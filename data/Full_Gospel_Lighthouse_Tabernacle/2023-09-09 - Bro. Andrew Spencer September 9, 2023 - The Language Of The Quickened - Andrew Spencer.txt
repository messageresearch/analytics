Hallelujah all right we've got so much to be thankful for man if you have your Bibles this evening when lock to look over in a couple portions of scripture Ephesians chapter 2 and then also John chapter 16 and 12 and I just wanna again thank the Lord for all that he did for us this past weekend and our Labor Day meetings and one of the most successful meetings we've ever been a part of and uh to thank it's our Jubilee time and you know we've we're just really privileged to have our our brother Timothy and brother Tim and brother Donnie come and speak such masterpieces and we think so highly of their Ministries and and we just know that the Lord used them in a mighty way and um many wonderful things have abounded from those meetings and I know that there'll be a blessing for until we leave here amen amen before we read tonight maybe we'll just speak to the author of the word here Heavenly Father we come before you tonight Lord we're your children Lord and we recognize whose presence that we're in Lord is this presence that we feel here tonight it's it's not that of a pope it's not that of a potentate or a king it's the presence a little Sharia the presence of The Great I Am and to think father how that you have brought us out of the worlds of chaos and to think that you're the god that is fighting for us when we think about every song that's been sung here this this evening Lord every special was lined up father you're fighting for your children every sick and Afflicted and diseased one you're fighting for them because that's just your way you're the same yesterday today and forever and tonight we invite you Lord Jesus Lord to come and lay your hands upon every one of us here under the sound of your voice father begin to minister to us Lord according to your word Lord your people with hungered we have fed we have rejoiced over the things that were done in our meetings this past week and I pray father that you would once again come Lord Just Like You Do Lord and begin to minister to your people father I pray that you'd bind every evil spirit in every demonic power that would hinder us father from moving into the presence of the Living God may we just lay aside every thought and everything of the world just now and come in fully under the anointing of the word father and find our position in you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we ask these things amen Ephesians chapter 2 and verse 1 and you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins wherein times past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience among whom also we all had our conversations in times past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and Word By Nature children of Wrath even as others and I'm so thankful that that was in the past but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together which Christ with Christ by Grace you are saved John chapter 16 and verse 12. John chapter 16 and verse 12. and here our Lord speaks some very powerful powerful words that we've we've garnered things many times our Prophet would speak from this from this this portion of scripture he would speak the spirit of Truth he would speak the God and he would speak different things across across these texts right here and Jesus said in verse 12 he said I have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them and to think that the disciples where they were they they had watched the Living God they'd watched Jesus in action but they could not handle because there was another Ministry that was coming that was coming into play and it was it was your ministry it's the ministry of Christ in your life and to think they could not bear those things because it wasn't their time but how be it when he the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all Truth for he shall not speak of himself but of whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come and he shall glorify me for he shall receive of mine and show it shall show it unto you all things that the father hath are mine therefore said I that he shall take of mine and show it unto you may God bless his word he may be seated in the presence of the Lord tonight I'd like to speak to you a thought that the Lord's been been dealing with us on for for some time now just kind of in our spirit here but I'd like to speak to you on a thought on the language of the quickened the language of the quick and we recognize immediately that the spirit of Truth is the one that is going to guide us into all truth and we recognize by by Jesus's words that that the spirit of Truth is going to speak what the spirit is saying he is not going to add to he's not going to add or take away but it is simply going to speak what the father is speaking and we recognize that where we are are living at as the Church of the Living God that our lord Jesus the spirit of the word the author of the word is the same one that was speaking all the way back there in the Garden of Eden and we recognize that that same spirit is speaking right here in the very last age amongst the Church of the Living God and to think that that the the Bible is very clear and very evident upon this that that he that is the spirit of truth will speak in this last days and and Peter or Paul would say that in his letter to Timothy in first Timothy 4 and 1 that now the spirit speaketh expressing that in latter times some shall depart from the faith and we recognize that that does not Shake us because we recognize that we are under a under a Commandment that the spirit had already prophesied when you see loved ones and you see ones that are departing not from a faith but they're departing from the faith that which we are contending for we recognize that the spirit has already spoke to us that these things should come to pass but we know this that the spirit is the one that doeth the speaking and we recognize that without him any mortal man is completely helpless without the spirit of the Living God we recognize that the scriptures that we are reading that all of them came by the very inspiration of the Holy Ghost and we we look throughout the The Book of Revelations and we'll find that every Church age that at the end of that church age you'll see that Jesus announces to that church age that he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit is saying unto the churches but you we recognize and understand this that only a Spirit-filled man can hear the Revelation for that age so we understand immediately that there are going to be people that may be sit around it or maybe people that get close to it but the people that only hear what the spirit is speaking they can only understand the revelation of what the messenger is releasing in that generation or in that age or in that moment so we recognize if we want to catch what the spirit is speaking to the age we've got to have the same Spirit of the one that spoke the word because if we are not in tune with the one that wrote the word we'll never be able to act upon the word of God but if we are in tune with the spirit of the one that wrote the word then we can express what God thought of before the foundation of the world so we realize that it is his Spirit throughout every Church age that it was a spirit that was speaking through Paul it was a spirit that was speaking through iranius and Columba and all the way down through through Wesley and Martin and William Bradham we recognize it was not the man it was the spirit of God that God was using that anointing or that man under that dispensation that he was sitting there a man that could tap into the very mind of Christ for the age that he was under you see because if William Branham would have came with with Paul's message or or with Luther's message it would have not match the peace that we were needing here in laodicea because we needed a releasing message we needed a restoration message we didn't need the man-age anointing upon us that it already came and it's still here but what we needed was an eagle anointing to take our faith to recognize that what the spirit was speaking for laodicea to take us higher into a realm to believe that all things are possible we had to come under a messenger and a people that are under that messenger that have got the spirit of the one that wrote the word they will be a final voice to the final h is that right so we realize that all of this is in line with First Corinthians chapter 2 and 11 for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given unto us which things also we speak not in Words which man's Wisdom teaches but which the Holy Ghost teacheth so if we're going to understand the scriptures if we're going to understand the age that we're in we've got to be led by the spirit how did Simeon get down there to baby Jesus when it was his time to go into the temple he was led by the spirit how are men under the anointing of the word how are they going to find Thee the avenue to preach a message that is going to bring a people Deliverance except by the preaching of the word under the anointing of the spirit of living God now you remember when William Branham would tell us he said he said you would take he said you'd take a little fish he said that little fish has certain certain senses about its body and it has certain things he said it's got it by radar so that it looks for food in certain places all the way down there in that dark deep midnight ink it can't find anything it can't see anything but yet it's got a sense so that it can know and hunt for food because of radar he said but our sense of sight is so much better than that little fish is down there that can look down there and find it our sense of sight is so much greater than that little fish he said but hello if that fist could become me he said if that fish could become me he would never want to go back to living that kind of a fish life again he said but he's got to be pressurized to live in the atmosphere that we as human beings live at you see you and I understand what it's like to be caught up from what it would be as known as the nature of the old man so we know what it's like to live in the nature of the new man and there's no way that you and I there's not anybody that's here spirit filled by the holy ghost that could ever be talked in into of going back to that kind of a living anymore but oh if you understand who you are if you understand where you are you've been pressurized you're not just a little fishy tonight you're the Church of the Living God there's no way that no devil in hell could talk you back into going out there and living that kind of a life anymore because that's not who you are anymore you don't even know that language no more you don't even know the talk no more but what you do know is that there is a land beyond the river what you do know that there is a holy ghost what you do know there is a message what is it we've never been caught up into the realm of faith and we're not going back to that kind of a life no more you see what it was when the Prodigal Son recognized and remember who he was he remembered he could go back to his daddy's house and he could live like a son again and when you got that kind of faith and you know who you are you're not going back to hog living no more now I'm going to take you higher than that why would you go back to denominational thinking when you've already been birthed into a message that gives you the very mind of Christ to tap into the channels of the Holy Ghost well Glory Luther never walked where you're walking Wesley never walked where you're walking why would you want to go back to that kind of a living come on somebody you're not talking Luther's language you're not talking Wesley's language you're talking this Malachi 4 language and it's this language that'll change your mortal bodies what was it when they got out there out through the upper room they wasn't talking their language no more they were talking a Heavenly language foreign said here in perfect Faith he said we are taught to resist the devil and he will flee from us he said now to resist it's just to Simply turn him down just resist him and just to walk away from it so when Satan comes to you with offers of of just easy believism what do you got to do you've got to turn him down if he offers you a better kind of Life turn him down if he offers you success in the world what do you do you turn him down come on somebody if he offers you money what do you do you turn him down if he offers you so that you can have a kingdom without a Calvary what do you do you turn him down he said you just resist him he said that's the way it is you walk away from him he said God said a certain thing no matter what he's trying to tell you you don't have to listen to the devil your ears are death to anything else but what the spirit says your ears are deaf to anything else but what the spirit says to he that hath an ear listen see what the spirit saith under the churches he said that's one thing that the one thing that's got a listening post that catches what the spirit says unto the churches so you see your ear is death to everything else out there in the world you can't even think that kind of thinking you can't even hear that kind of a hearing no more you see you see you look at these TVs and you look at these instruments of radio and you look at them you say oh I wish I had that kind of ability then I could produce a picture like that but do you realize that you are built so much greater than that television that Taps into a channel that breaks into an atmosphere and brings what's here in the waves of the sound and in the airwaves and brings it to pass but you are built in a greater way than that you are built so that you hear that hearing our faith comes by hearing do you recognize that you are the channel which God is looking for to bring forth miracles God ain't looking for TVs to bring forth Miracles God ain't looking for tape players to bring forth Miracles God is looking for human beings that have understood by the preaching of the word that faith has risen Hallelujah you're barely you're built greater you are built under the channel of the Holy Ghost I've been dropping this to you that over and over again before you can believe it somebody's got to preach it that's what Paul said in Romans 10 and 17 Faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God so if you're going to believe in a miracle somebody's got to preach about a miracle if you're going to believe in a Rapture you've got to have somebody preach to you that there is a Rapture if you're going to believe anything you've got to hear about it well hey we had a voice speak to us in this day that in the last days that I will sin unto you Malachi 4. ain't it wonderful to recognize Who You Are what are you looking at brother Andrew I'm looking at a people that know who they are how did Elijah how did Elijah tell gajesha when the when them Angels were out there William Branham said that it had been Elijah didn't even see them angels He said but he understood by the scripture of Psalms 34 and 7 that them Angels were encamped about them that fear him so Elijah didn't necessarily see it and you may not see your miracle in the room you may not see your healing in the room but by faith Elijah could say look out there geesha there's more with us than there is against us and I don't know whether you understand this or not there's more miracles coming there's more prodigals returning there's more faith arising than what you can see in the building how do you know it brother answer he's the same yesterday today and forever God ain't changed one time God ain't lost one power his power's not been damaged his powers not been demolished how do you say those things brother Andrew I've got the authority of God's word to back up what are you saying brother ain't true this is the language of a third pole people what is it what is the third pull it's our language to the king it's a king's heart this King has handled this sword before and this queen knows exactly what he wants done with the word what is it it's a very mind of God when William Branham preaches future home and things that are to be what is it it's God's Vision being projected by a prophet that this is God's Own thoughts this is what I'm looking for this is the kind of character that I have these are the kind of people that are going to live in my city people that understand who I am you know him you know him and because you know him there's power in Resurrection you see how is God going to allow anybody to live in his house that doesn't understand him that doesn't know him and because you know him you understand him you see I could say something to you and it wouldn't mean nothing to a Baptist or it wouldn't mean nothing to a church of Christ but I could say the same thing to you and it'll make you shout it'll make you dance it'll make you scream and it'll make you holler why because you understand him that's why the rest of the world is saying why are they so happy why are they leaping why are they shouting it's because you are in tune with the spirit that is speaking in this generation it's a powerful thing when you understand when you understand him you see what did what did Elijah do to gehaza he simply changed his vision to not look at what he was seeing but look to the Unseen what did what did Moses when he was standing there and the opposition was against him when they've got the Red Sea when they've got the Red Sea in front of them they've got the pillar of fire behind them and they've got iseros Egyptians armies out there and they're chasing him down but what does the spirit of God say why cry speak and go forward you see you don't have to worry about what's in front of you as long as you know who's behind you come on now you don't have to worry about Egypt you don't have to worry about Pharaoh it's a pillar of Fire if he's behind you if he's got your six I'll tell you one thing for sure ain't no damn on Hell gonna rob you from your joy ain't gonna rob you from your inheritance he's not going to rob you from your Abstract title dude [Applause] these men were commissioned but they were afraid most of them been up on that mountain he's commissioned but he was disappointing God because he was afraid he said what are you looking at it's amazing how our language changes by what we see it's amazing it's amazing how a doctor can look at a scene because of a CT scanner or an MRI and it can say a certain word and your whole entire day changes because of what somebody else is seeing before you walked in there and seen what them doctors had you was out there profession I am healed by his stripes but the power of faith it doesn't matter what you're looking at it doesn't matter what you're seeing you are simply staying with the word of God and it didn't matter how big it didn't matter how big that that Red Sea was and it didn't matter how big Pharaoh's Army was behind them there was a God that was on their side now for two million people to get across a Red Sea God's got to open that Red Sea five miles five miles wide to get two million people across there in the right timing and if God can take a pillar of fire and move back the greatest one of the greatest rivers that there is move back that Sea move it back move that sea back if you can move it back five miles for two million people what can he do with you don't let what you see change your faith now brother random said he said in the Book of Job he said job feared and what he feared it actually happened he said what brought it his fear he said that's what made it happen he said his faith had kept him from it but his fear brought him brought it to him he was scared and it was he was scared it was going to happen and it did happen now he said he noted what happened now he he knowed it wouldn't happen he wouldn't it wouldn't have happened you see here you see he what it what brought that to him was his fear his faith kept it away but his fear brought it to him you see oftentimes our language completely changes the Bible said that job was a perfect man but what he was looking at what he was looking at was almost greater than what he thought his life was worth the obstacles that was taking place in job's life 42 chapters the obstacles that was against job all of that you can look through all of them scriptures and all of that happened in one year one year all that happened to job he lost everything but job was sitting out there and he began to look at his problems but God has not asked us to look at our problems he's looked he's looking for us to look at his promise when Peter was out there when Peter's out there on that waves those white caps were rolling across there and they were scared that they were going to they were scared that they were going to die out there in the middle of that storm all of a sudden Here Comes Jesus walking on the waters Here Comes Jesus walking on the waters notice what it does he was fearful and then he had faith why because the one that was walking on the waters I began to look at that picture that you bought a sister Anna brother Jeffrey I began to look at that today and I began to think about how great those waves were Peter been out there on them Waters many times but he ain't never seen a storm like this and when he looked out there and he saw Jesus walking on the waters what did he do he said Lord if that be you bid me to come what did Jesus do he changed his fear to Faith that's what Jesus is doing right here in the midst of the Church of the Living God he's changing your fear for Faith you don't have to worry about Daniel's heart trouble you don't have to worry about how the baby's coming you don't have to worry about how sugar diabetes is living leaving you don't have to worry about how cancer is leaving this word is changing your fear to Faith foreign Jesus and Peter walking on the water together it's a pretty awesome sight I'd like to see that it's the same as you taking God at his word and walking through laodicea whenever Devon hails got its head got its head and it's got its Target over you it's the same with your faith to believe for the impossible to step out on the waters unafraid but notice what happened with Peter Peter started looking at the wind are you you no good and well you can't see wind you can't see the wind but you can see the effects of the Wind what did he do he started looking at the circumstances around him because of the wind of the prince of the power of the air and it changed what what Peter was looking at he was looking at the word why did Peter step out there in the first place because the word said he could step out there and what did he do fear came and it made him lose his faith in what the word says what did the word say the enemy the enemy came against Peter just like that in a matter of seconds and changed his vision to change his language to see what Satan will do to you he'll throw sickness in your way he'll throw troubles in your way he'll throw roadblocks in your way to mess up your mind to change your vision because if he can change your vision he can change your language is that right if you can change your language if you can change your vision it can change your language because there's power in your tongue there's power in your speech he's the high priest of our confession what was he doing he was doing all right till he got scared he started walking on water and what Peter feared happened well Peter feared happened I believe that more people have more faith in their fear they've got more faith in their fear than the Devils got fear in their faith you see what what what Peter feared actually happened it's amazing uh I know every child every child is understanding this mama stick a pile of towels over towels and clothes that you need to fold up the next day stick them over in the corner I can't tell you how many times I've seen ghosts hanging over in the corner that's why I was a good boy I always put my clothes away first before I went to bed I was tired of seeing them ghosts hanging over in that corner but it's amazing it's amazing what you do in the window of the night you wake up and all of a sudden you see them in pile of clothes sitting over everything man your imagination gets to playing what did it do you are perfectly in peace over there sleeping but because of what you've seen it changed your whole atmosphere see what are you looking at brother Andrew why is your faith so high I'm not worried about how you're going to get in I'm looking at the promise I'm not looking at how brother Ron's going to get healed I'm looking at Calvary I'm not looking at your prodigals out there still in the in the Sin and the muck to the world I'm looking at the promise what is that promise brother Danny it tells us that we're going to be there and our Offspring with him and if God is as good as his word I don't have to understand how he's going to do it I just have to take him Matt his word well somebody give the Lord a hand clap of Breeze when you believe you can walk on the water but when you fear you start sinking I say it's high time you let your faith rise grab a hold of the master of the wind and start walking on your troubles [Applause] well Glory Glory well the man said he said let loose and let go he said how do you do that brother Brandon he said just let go that's all you have to do take God's word don't try to work up nothing don't let down at the altar don't get down as the Altar and beat on it and holler God give me the Holy Ghost Lord give me the Holy Ghost he ain't coming you beating on the altar that ain't gonna do you no good no that ain't the that ain't the way it comes it's taking him at his word he said look at Peter Peter was in trouble looked like he was going to die and he's seen the Lord come walking on water he said Lord if it be you bid me come he said Lord said come on now Peter said now wait a minute Lord let me go on a 40-day fast to see if I can walk on water or not oh Lord let me get enough Spirit on me that I can dance in the spirit and speak in tongues in this boat then I can step out no sir he took God in his word he let loose and let go just took him through it he said what if God when he met Moses said Moses go down there and into Egypt and tell Pharaoh let my people go what if Moses said let me go on a 40-day fast see if I got enough Faith to obey you God give me something something another Lord let me tell you something let me let me see if I got enough spirit in me first Moses never asked no questions he just took God at his word and took off he said that's the way you have to do it take God at his word then you know you'll be able to do it he didn't wait till something else took him place he just went ahead and he done it what are you doing brother Angela I'm telling you that if you can take God at his word you can change your body what is it what is it it's the Dynamics that's come upon the mechanics and it's making it all come to pass what is the Dynamics it's a refilling of the Holy Ghost and what is he doing in this generation he's pouring the very mind of Christ into the vessels that have emptied themselves out so that he could pour himself in now William Branham said in the seventh seal he said if there's a pie he said if there's a pile of trumpets sitting up here he said he said they are completely mute without a human being to get behind them and blow through it he said they're completely mute he said and if God would come and work through me or work through one of these brothers he said it wouldn't be me he would be the intelligence behind the sound the trumpet is completely mute but it's the intelligence behind the sound that makes it sound out what is that that is speaking out of you that is saying that all things are possible it's the intelligence of the one that wrote the word when Moses was back there talking to a burning bush what was it it was the intelligence that had the power to get Egypt get Israel out of Egypt what was it Moses didn't have to figure out how to get out of it he'd have to figure out how big and how many Giants and how many people were down there he didn't have to figure it out the intelligence that was talking to him at that Burning Bush was everything that Moses had need of who glow the Lord of Mercy I believe I'm getting ready to talk in another language what was it it had the power to speak to Moses and Moses was once afraid running from the presence of the Lord but a burning bush something that scientifically cannot be proven it changed his language how to change his language brother Andrew he went from being a coward to me in a one-man Invasion with a rod in his hand what was it that Burning Bush was a sign that had a voice behind it and the voice that was backing up the sign was going to make sure that Israel got out and got to her Homeland it's the same intelligence that is working amongst the body of Jesus Christ and he's bringing her out now notice all of them Israelites are down there all them years but what was they doing they was waiting on God my brother random said God was waiting on them to put him into action he was waiting on them to put him in action now Moses was born with a purpose in his life but brother random said it was spoken word is the Original Seed he said he had to wait for the extra gift to get the job done and what you have made of is this message of Malachi 4. you see you had to wait you may have been born you may have been born before the seals were released but you had to wait on themselves to get into a rapture that's what brother Brandon said in perfect Faith he said when a man lives by faith walks by faith I mean substance Faith he is isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in Christ there now you're getting in the bride material you're getting into rapturing condition notice no God never put signs in front of the word but they followed that word follow that word you watch what happened up there with Moses what did he do he took God at his word he took his shoes off and he walked up there in the presence that Pillar of Fire you looked up there and Elijah or under Elijah's Ministry he walked up there when there hadn't been rain for three years ain't been fed by the Ravens for so long and God dried up his Cricket player and told him to go by that widow's house up there and when Elijah began to talk to her what was he doing he was making her language obey with him good morning Lord he was making her language obey with the word of God and that little woman he talked to her he said what are you doing she said I'm baking me a cake for me and my son to go and die but what did he say to her bake me a cake first what is it you put the word first and the word or the miracle will take place on the word signs follow the word but you got to put the word first and when you put the word first the miracle will take place after you take God at his word thank you when Daniel when you're looking Daniel chapter 5 and there you look at belshazzar and he has a feast what does he do he goes up there and he takes instruments out of the temple of God and brings him down there to his hoedown and has a party and he takes the things that should be in the temple of God and he puts them down there in his own so-called party and there that the Bible tells us that they are appearing a hand of a man and begin to write a certain language on the side of the wall of the plaster of the wall what was it there there brother Branham said in the handwriting of the wall a handwriting on the wall he said there belshazzar began to talk to his astronomers and his doctors of divinity and his so-called popes and Bishops and Cardinals of the day and said what does this tell us what does this mean to us but you see this was the entering into the Gentile Kingdom and only Supernatural things can be understood by our spiritual people and there those astronomers astrologers and soothsayers were up there running around trying to figure out what in the world is going on there they're beating her head trying to figure out what that says but there was a little old Queen there was a little old queen that brother Randall said she hadn't been in town or no rock and roll party she hadn't been down on no Honky Tonk she'd been up there and she came and brought peace to the king and said O King there is a man in your kingdom that is excellent in spirit he is a dissolver of doubts what was it Daniel understood the language of the one that was writing the word well Glory watch them seals mean to everybody else they don't understand it but what's been ruled over this generation it's a perfect language for the Bride of Jesus Christ she knows what he's saying to her the rest of the world looks out there and sees Christ riding on that white horse but you as a body of Jesus Christ understand that that's the Antichrist writing out there with a bow but he ain't got no arrows what am I saying to you the prophet was talking your language brother Jim [Applause] how is it so easy for you to believe because you are a jean seed of God how is it that little girl understood that there was somebody there it's because she had seen the dissolver of Doubt work you see a bill Sasson would have paid attention if he'd been out there where he should have been at as a king looking to a prophet he'd have been understanding where he could have went up there and got his doubts dissolved but I want to say this to you church that the dissolver of doubts is in this room this morning or this evening it's the devil's job to give you questions it's a devil's job to make it out it's a devil's job to make your unbeliever give you disbelief and make you doubt and make you fear the promises of God but the message is answer let me put it in your prophet's language you're the answer to the devil's question it's a devil's job brother Jonathan to bring questions but you're the answer Lord have mercy what is it what is it it's a dissolver of doubts are still working what was it when David was out there and the armies of God was paralyzed by fear and looking at Goliath sister Riley what was it there was a little old man that was a dissolver of doubts what what's Daniel down there in the Lion's Den he was the dissolver of doubts what is it when the enemy comes and tells you that God don't do Miracles no more God is a desire of doubts I don't even know how to talk that language Jay it's like me trying to teach Spanish it ain't gonna work it ain't gonna work I can't tell you anything about Spanish because I don't know the language I think it's a beautiful thing when somebody does know that thank God for Google translate that right y'all know what I'm talking about don't you all right that's good I'm glad y'all I don't understand what I'm talking about they on the internet don't have a clue that's all right I won't inform you either but some of you don't understand what I'm talking about why because y'all don't understand that Jay was offered a job this week to be a Spanish teacher y'all didn't have a clue what I was talking about too I just told you is that right why because you didn't understand what I'm saying but because I gave you a knowledge you can now understand thank you brother Jay I appreciate you you letting me use that for you tonight now I can't talk French and I can't talk Dutch and I cannot talk all those things but sometimes I can sure get out some good English words every once in a while and I sometimes have a trouble speaking out sometimes I'm good at talking hillbilly Virginian that's mixed with Appalachian Mountain talk and a little bit of the Eastern Seaboard I'm real good at that foreign Homer one time we took him up there we took him up we took him up north and he got to talking to somebody let me say like he took him up north we took him up there North and they began to ask him they heard him talking and if you ever heard of Frasier talk it's a Frasier language and they asked and said what country are you from they didn't understand his language but to every one of you that are setting here that understood that lingo you knew what he was talking about Ain't It Funny sister Francis you know what he was talking about in the rest of the world said what's what we're talking about but you understood his language what is the rest of the world looking at you and saying why are you shouting why are you acting like you're acting it's because you understand the language of the spirit that is speaking the word I know it's strong language I know it's strong language but how did that Finland boy that was wrecked up sitting over there without a hope but there was a prophet that showed up at the right time and said if a boy's not up off the ground in five minutes call me a false prophet I know it's strong language but did the boy get up then the language match a miracle [Applause] hallelujah what was Jordy Carter's language it was fake Thomas by hearing what was that blind girl down there in Memphis her language match the miracle what is this sound that's going amongst the Church of the Living God it's the language of a miracle what's is going on your faith rising to a level to believe that your pastor can be sugar diabetes free it's a language of a miracle Hallelujah [Applause] where's my daddy where's my daddy where's my daddy if you can just get me to the Healer I'll find my daddy actually hear about it she heard about it through the radio that there was a blind man down there from Camden Arkansas that had received his sight and she said if God can do it for him God can do it for me it doesn't matter how blind you are God can still open up your eyes God still gives hearing to those that are death to it what is it sister Gabrielle he knows he knows where your daddy's at he knows where your daddy at so you ain't got to worry about it you ain't got to worry about it all you got to do is say Lord just give me to the Healer and I'll find my daddy well what am I saying to you the dissolver of Doubt sister Wanda is in the building not to worry about it you have to worry about a sister Francis the Lord Our God that heals all of your diseases he's in the building but people say let me quote your Prophet to you he said people say that the days of Miracles are passing he said it is for those that for that are out from underneath the blood he said but if you're underneath the blood the day he said if you're underneath the blood the days of Miracles are for you I don't know if you understand what I'm saying to you tonight but your Miracle is here today foreign do you understand what I'm saying to you am I speaking your language tonight that that this is who who you are you're built to believe you're built to channel this when William Branham goes out there and that little girl recognizes who he is she ain't gonna let him go until he prays for it but brother Byron said I had to let her go he said because the Lord had to get her let me go so I could grab a hold of her he said because the Lord was dealing with me in a sign of the hand at that time and he said I had to have he said I had to have faith to know that her sight was returning back to her and he said when I took her by the hand he said I raised her eyes up he said I could feel that that Spirit of that tumor that was on her eye that it was completely gone and when she opened up her eyes she began to see completely and she was made whole the brother man said I walked over there in the corner he said there was an old man that had been laying there for eight days trying to get into the presence of the Healer he said he where he was he said his foot was all twisted up his leg was off to itself had all kinds of kids back home he said I have waited for this he's not waiting for this for eight days he said I ain't eating two days I've been sitting out here in this rain waiting for this moment what was it the one that was getting ready to talk his language he said Do you believe God can heal you he said if you believe God can heal you then hand me that cane and before he handed him that cane he started handing him that cane and when he had started handing him that cane all of a sudden his leg completely came straight and he took off running and shouting what are you willing to let go are you willing to let go of your crutch of of this I've disbelieved this for so long are you willing to let go of your crutch my my mama died this way my daddy died this way why don't you let them things go You Ain't Gotta Die the same way your daddy died you ain't got to live in the same cycle your mama lived here what are you willing to let go he said but oh if you only if you just rely on Hope You Hinder Faith he said hope looks for something way off but Faith claims it right now faith says God said so and it's mine that settled said I don't care if I'm if I'm still crippled I'm still blind if I'm still sick that don't have nothing to do with it I believe it anyhow it's mine right now God said so and that sells it that's faith but hope says God said so and I'm expecting to get it someday notice the difference between Faith and Hope hope is expecting to get it someday he said you see I'm expecting someday and he said as long as Satan can put you off to another day he said that's as good as he wants you see that's all satan wants is for you to put it off for another service put it off for getting things right for another day or for another time or or another moment when the prayer line That's what Satan was wanting you to do is put it off somewhere he said you'll never get it just believe that you got it right now it's your personal property faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen is that right Faith acts now it's positive there oh my I tell you sickness and everything else when Faith steps in it's just like a snowball in a hot stove it just melts away everything goes away from Faith because Faith stands up and takes rule over it when Faith speaks everything else keep still that's right Faith only knows one language it's a word faith is a powerful thing faith in God can move a mountain mother burn them mother won't tell me he's in his room he's getting ready to go to a meeting and he and he's there and he and he starts becoming cognitive of that there's somebody standing outside the door and then they start talking in another language he said I heard it he said I heard it in German he said I heard it sounded like German something out there he said I tried to come to myself and and those things he said but he said when I come to it was me speaking in another language he said he said I had Soul he said he said I just set Real Steel and he said when he left me he said I felt like I could run through a troop and leap over a wall he said I never felt so good in all my life and and there Billy Paul was out there knocking on doors said Daddy they're ready for you down there and when when brother Brandon told him he said now just wait a minute just wait a minute let me get myself ready there he was speaking in another language and when he got down there to the meeting he said there was a he said they brought me a testimony that there was a sister out there that had tuberculosis he said she had tuberculosis and she was hemorrhaging and the doctor said that if she had one more Hemorrhage that she was going to die and she had gotten to such a place that the ambulance and the hospital said we're not going to allow you to leave this hospital room because if you have one more Hemorrhage you're going to die but there were some saints that gathered up some people there and put her in a station wagon and put her put her back there made her a spot where she could lie down back there and and then she got to coming down there she was going to that meeting and there when when she got to going down them roses probably out there in Arkansas and bad roads out there Oklahoma he's got her going down those roads and those roads were so rough it actually caused her to start hemorrhaging again and and then she she said she said I don't want to die here in this car she and her life was going down all the time going down she says I don't want to die here in the car so they pulled over on the side of the road and they just laid her out there laid her out there in the grass and and she and she was completely going down getting lower and lower all that time he said all of a sudden all of a sudden that little girl that girl that had dealt with that jumped up and started running back and forth down the street running back and forth down the street he said what was it he said I found out it was the same time that I was up there in my room talking in another language it was the same time that that girl was receiving her healing you may not understand why you go into intercessory prayers sometimes and you start talking in another language but maybe it's for somebody that's a cost a thousand miles away maybe it's for somebody in a meeting like tonight that you break out in faith maybe you don't understand why you're praying the way you're praying maybe you don't understand why you're praising the way you're praising but oh if you could break into a channel the language of the Holy Ghost comes upon you I'm saying to you it's time to tell the devil you changed your mind because the Bible said in Galatians 3 and 13 that Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us for it is written that cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree if you go to studying out Deuteronomy chapter 28 you'll find that that is a that is a chapter of blessings and cursings and if you go to studying it out there's more curses that come from disobeying God then there is blessings that come from obeying God but if you go to studying that out you'll find in there there's pestilence that came from disobeying God's God on God's word tuberculosis there's fever there there's inflammation there's extreme burning there's Bots there's hemorrhoids there's scabs there's itches there's blindness there's smiting in the knee and in the leg and and the failing of the eyes and if you really want to find who you are if you can't find your disease and all of those scriptures here go to Deuteronomy 28 and 60 and 61 you'll find that all of them diseases that you have or have been down throughout history are laying right there in that chapter laughs that's a weird way to end of service oh no it ain't because Paul said that Christ redeemed us from these curses now you look at your family history and you look at your DNA and you look at what you battle with you see that as a curse you see those things but the Bible said that Christ redeemed you from the curse of the law because he was made a curse for you you see the curse of the law it included all diseases every sickness every plague known throughout the history of the world in order for Christ to redeem us from this terrible curse of the law he was made a curse for us so Christ bore our punishment that was prescribed by the law that is why he had to take our infirmities and bear our sickness when Adam and Eve sold us into slavery the devil put us into bondage according to his power but the Bible said Christ redeemed us he brought us back what did he do he purchased us with a price of his own body and blood for you are bought with a price therefore glorify God in your body what am I saying to you that Jesus becoming your curse is your freedom it's time you start telling the devil I'm changing my language for the good I'm changing my mind salvation is my freedom salvation is my freedom Christ is my savior Christ is my healer Christ is my Waymaker what is it it's time that you start confessing that and start speaking the language of winter what is it confess your freedom instead of your bondage confess with his stripes I'm Healed instead of your sickness confess your Redemption from every disease confess that you are Redemption is complete free in Christ Jesus confess that Satan's dominion over you ended at Calvary what am I saying to you you've got to turn your mouth loose to confess it you've got to change your language what happened up there on the day of Pentecost it changed their language where they were talking the language of a coward and they come out with The Bravery of the Lion of the tribe of Judah what am I saying to you you are not alone no longer a slave to your fear when the slaves of the United States when they begin to hear when they when they begin to hear about the Emancipation they begin to hear about it they were still slaves living in slave quarters they still look like slaves they still felt like slaves but when the Emancipation Proclamation was read and put into legal rights they had every legal right to say that I am free I am free I'm no longer a slave I can act on my Liberty that's why Paul would say Stand Fast therefore in your Liberty where Christ has made you free so you have every ability to stand there say I'm free I'm not bound I'm not going back to that kind of a living what am I saying to you if you can change your language you can change Dimensions if you can change your faith you can change places with somebody else what would AI Elvis right to do today he'd like to change places with somebody else what would Marilyn Monroe like to do today she'd like to change places with somebody else but you gun girls if you can change your dress it'll change your conduct if you can change what you're listening to you can change your atmosphere if you can stop talking the devil's language and start talking the mighty Angels message start talking what he said about you start saying what he believed in you I am an offspring of God I am a gene seed of God I'm born to live this message I am an overcomer thank you I'm not dead to this no more I'm not dead to this kind of talking no more I'm free I know that now if you I'm going to close with this thought right here you want to ever go and go do a study at the message throughout the message that'll bless you just go do a study on that kind of faith on that kind of Faith he said that's Christ's attitude is that exactly the same to you today as it was at Calvary he said he's here to heal you this night he said maybe you might not have that spontaneous Faith to bring something he just just a miracle right to you you may not have that kind of Faith but Jesus said if you had the faith like a mustard seed you could say to this mountain be moved and buy it it would come to pass it wouldn't it wouldn't vanish it away but by and by it'll come to pass maybe you ain't got the kind of Faith like some of these other brothers and sisters guy but if you got that kind of faith if you got that kind of Faith that's God's language remember when those enemies that were down there and there were the lepers that were down there and they were they were sitting there at the gate and they were sitting there dying in their conditions and they began to say well I said we here until we die why don't we go down to the house of our enemy maybe if we'll go down there maybe they'll have mercy upon us and brother banham said that when they went down there God upon the merits of that kind of Faith rewarded them and caused a great Rumble to come upon the desert and they thought that Israel had hired some soldiers to come out there and they ran and they went into the tents and found life found food and found wine not only did they save their own lives but they saved the city's life with that kind of faith it ran the enemy off of their ground he said I'm telling you he said but you've not come to the house of the enemy tonight you've come to London to the father oh come on what is surrounding you if you can have that kind of faith well if you could have that kind of Faith you're not at the enemy's house you're at the father's house oh and Martha and Mary were in a bad condition when Jesus come walking to them they said even now I believe that you can make my brother rise again brother Burnham said with that kind of faith he said something was going to happen what was it only believe sometimes we try to make Faith so so big well faith is really it's real so simple people try to work themselves up into believing but you got here you had enough Faith to start your car you had enough Faith to get here what would happen tonight if you just begin to change your language to the redeemed of the Lord every situation around you would begin to crumple and the enemy began to run if you just change your language well I've been sick for so long Once you turn that around and say I've been healed for 2000 years we stopped changing we we started changing our language we started changing our language that Zoe hasn't spoke yet to Zoe is speaking well you're you're really you're really you're really not telling the truth there brother Andrew have you heard her talk that little girl starting to talk I began to tell a testimony about sister Whitney's healing while I was up here in Canada a while back and I started talking about y'all remember y'all was down here at that tent meeting brother Sean's a couple years ago and Whitney come through there had that had that uh condition where she couldn't hardly eat anything she she had done she was on a crazy strict diet and I began to tell that story how the angel Lord met Whitney over there at the side of that tent and I don't know how many maybe it was a couple of them we begin to I don't remember but we were going to talk we're going to talk about that was I believe I know at least two sisters came up said I'm dealing with the same exact thing you can go listen to a testimony up here at Cloverdale and you can hear that God used that testimony to bring healing to those two girls maybe more than that I don't know I began to talk about I began to talk about brother album backer I had a bad skin disease had had to add scabs on his hands and everything else and there was Brothers up there I I think I prayed for maybe seven boys that had the same condition but because of the power of faith of somebody else realizing that God was a god of the Bible it changes your whole language I don't know when and I don't know how but I know He'll Do It Again let's stand what did Jesus do when he brought those disciples up there on the day of Pentecost brother Brandon said in the Easter seal he said he took the fear out of them and made them believe he took the fear out of them and quickened them to live so I don't know how to talk that kind of language I'm not I'm not necessarily good like you I don't listen to all them sermons like you you can you can do that that ain't too hard to do if I can figure out how to do it I know you can't well brother Andrew I'm just a simple person if God can take a possum brother Doug if God can take a possum that don't talk English that don't understand Kentucky hillbilly talk but he can make her have something on the inside of her that would cause her to go by prophet's door if he can have a little insignificant possum to believe that there is a scripture that says they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover that the prayer of faith shall save the sick there was something on the inside of that nature that made her understand the prophet's language she been sitting out there all of them hours those those little babies nursing the very life out of her and when brother Bynum kneeled down and prayed for her she jumped up walked down to the aisle walk down to the end of the walkway and she'd look back as to thank him if a possum had enough ability to turn around and thank God what what would you do if God can take an insignificant possum if God can take an insignificant little fish and bring life back to it if God can talk to a storm through a prophet's lips what am I saying to you the third pull is not some great big workup it's not something that's so high that only preachers and a scholar message Believers can attain he'll take a heavy right [Music] he'll take a handy right and make the third pool operate it ain't something way up there where you gotta have an education an intellectual talk the third pool is for you I'll be honest I'm so glad that this Prophet knew my language he didn't come to me with some scholarly ideas [Music] but he talks talk my kind of language and you can
