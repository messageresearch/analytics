i am a free man today jesus told a [Music] one day a pharisee did jesus brought a woman in an adult tree caught that man walked away in the sand condemned but the woman's guilt was gone jesus stood for sinners that no one else would stand for then he stood at calvary when we thought he could stand in the days after jesus had gone away a man named stephen was full of faith not because of men who were full of hate he went on trial for his faith he fearlessly preached about the days of when the prophets their father slayed and how they all rejected the holy ghost stephen gave his life that day

our friends with us today and good to see each and every one of you amen just good to be here amen just good to be here wow what a service last night amen and we're just we're just so thankful for those things and what god spoke to us last night and how he touched our hearts sure felt the lord when we when we prayed with you sister rocks again and know that god's god's got everything into control amen thank you for praying for us last week we had a wonderful meeting in louisiana i got a little bit loose i was just stretching my wings a bit you know and so that's probably the first time in a year or so i've stretched my wings quite like that and so hey all all eight cylinders worked real well so amen blue devil amen amen we uh i would like for you to pray for us this coming week we are going to go to brother paula fontaine's and i normally wouldn't do this kind of especially in the season of my life wouldn't do this but brother paula fontaine is having a church dedication and he asked me to come and when it comes to church dedications that's a soft spot of my heart and we're going to go and they have a new building there and we're going to dedicate that building to the lord and i've heard it's a very beautiful place and so i'm just honored to be a part of that i'll be speaking on saturday night and sunday morning and they have a back up just in case i blow silner so amen so we're we would ask you that you would pray for us and for those that don't know and new that are among us that's brother nathaniel and sister suzanne's uh it's her sister that is married to brother paul and so i'm sure most of you in this in this media society has just got it all together but i i generally don't but i just say everybody's my buddy and we love you my buddy brother david mayer just sent me a text just before i walked to the pulpit and told me how much he loved me and missed me and so i i greet him in the name of the lord this morning as well and so we got friends around the world that love us and i just want to share my love back to them amen i want to speak this morning if i can get there i'd like to speak to you on a on a fresh wind and the reason that i want to share these things with you i'm just going to just lay it right before you i feel like we're just right before the coming of the lord and god is not going to just heal our bodies of cancer but he's going to heal our bodies for mortal to turn to immortal and we have an expectation of a resurrection where these eyes will see our loved ones gathering here for 30 to 40 days and then go to meet the lord in the air i think it's a very neat process that brother branham explains to us is that the reason for that 30 40 days he said so you get to get to see who's there and he said you won't be looking around when you when you get there all of our eyes will be on jesus hallelujah hey listen as long as i'm there i want you to be there and that's my desire i want you to be there but i'm going to be there one in virginia i'm going to be that one all right or you're a selfish man brother ron no two in the bed want to be taken two in the field want to be taken two at the meal want to be taken i happen to believe i'm one of that one [Applause] amen i'm not waiting on you i'm not waiting on this or whenever that one we know that it'll we're only waiting for that last predestinated seed to come in and then we're going to go but i'm going to be there it's dropped in our hearts and so amen i want to go back to acts chapter 2 and just read a few things we'll read it get started and then we'll i'll just i will just because this was a fresh wind amen amen maybe you have a need you just like to drop before the lord and say lord i'd like to give this to you and touch our hearts this morning almighty god we love you with all of our hearts and lord we bring our petitions before you i have precious friends that are sick this morning and i ask you that you touch their bodies and the request comes in we just ask you that you administered to them so many have prayed for us in this season of of cancer but lord lord we're believing that god you're the healer we ask you now that you would touch our hearts and strengthen us lord may you as we look to this word this morning we ask you that you'd anoint not only the speaker but this audience hallelujah lord may you sweep through this building now satan this is not your service so you believe and father i pray now that you would get we could give ourselves 100 unreservedly to you this service we are under expectation for the coming of the lord bless this audience even now father touch them in a special way bless them jesus every request that came across this pulpit father send your word and heal them father lord we thank you father for every blessing in our life in jesus christ's name amen and amen amen for those that may not have been aware brother jason berner had his leg had a complete knee replacement and the doctors at uva which are very phenomenal teams said we don't know if we'll be able to put it back together and they just told him you may wake up from surgery with an amputated leg we can't make you any promises well they can't they can't but when he woke up he had a leg and and brother ray sister sue i just i just prayed he sent me a note then you you called me and i just i just said those words they can't but god you can and so we just thank you thank the lord that's the benefits of coming to church amen amen acts chapter 2 and this is the eternal prescription and when the day of pentecost was fully come they were all in one accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them clothing tongues like as a fire and it set up on each of them notice this next words and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance and they were dwelling at jerusalem and there were dwelling at jerusalem jews devout men out of every nation under heaven and when they were this was noised abroad the multitude came together and were confounded because that every man heard them speak in his own language and they were all amazed and marveled saying one another be behold are not all of these which speak galileans and how heard we every man in in our own tongue wherein we were born you may be seated i'd like to preface this it's been quite a a quite a several weeks or months that these people have been a part of they have watched jesus come toward the ending of his ministry and very much explaining who he is and trying to get the people to see who he is and what his mission on earth is to do and then telling them that i'll not leave you comfortless but i'm going to send a comforter a guide to you that that that will be with you that will will watch over you because jesus knew in their own humanity our humanity fails as much energies that we have as much vision as we have as much ego as we would have if it's not the right word but as much ego or press or driven as we have your humanity will only take you so far david built a house for people he wanted to build a house where people could look toward or come and worship god because he had a house he had a castle he had a tremendous place that he lived in and he wanted to build god a house and in this house he wanted people to come and they could worship and feel the presence of god he had felt him as a child but david knew that he was nothing without god you and i are nothing without god all of your abilities all your gifts all of your givings and all of those things you're nothing without god and even jesus would say this i can do nothing except my father shows me first jesus had to go away to pray and draw strength from almighty god never come to the place to word that you can just think you can get by without praying reading your bible coming to church we've got to have his presence in our lives we need a deeper consecration a deeper committal like never before sometimes you just need a fresh wind now these men as they're there jesus is going to make some astounding things to them and he's going to say let not your heart be troubled you believe in god believe also in me he knew these men were going to go through some incredible difficult trials so they needed the life of god they needed the life of god to live on the inside of them people can go to school and pick up the characteristics of beethoven or or shakespeare or some great author or some great artist somewhere but listen let me just say this that's only carnal impersonations to become like somebody else and what we need more is than churchianity or religious or any kind of theology we need the life of god [Applause] we need the same life that jesus had and jesus was telling them i'm going to send this same life i'm going to come back i'm going to change my veil before you couldn't see god pillar of fire will by will in the middle of a will fire in the in the tabernacle a burning bush that was the effects of god that he was in the prophets and it was a portion of god and in humanity and you could see god once in a while and then you could see moses you could see god and david then you could see david but god wants to so live in our lives and it's for you for the promises unto you and to your children even it's as many as afar off even as many as the lord our god shall call that dispensation never ended it's as much for you today as it's ever been and listen i don't care how long you've been a christian 30 40 years never let your fire burn out [Applause] are you with me oh brother ron but y'all have been here back in the days ago my that will give you a wiggle tail experience are you with me brother brown would preach sermons like restoration of a bride tree broken cisterns are you with me what is the attraction on the mountain you've got to keep your experience fresh [Applause] because remember god's not just a god of i was or i will be he wants to be an i am god for you what is he doing for you right now it's not the revival that was here 40 years ago or 20 years ago or 10 years ago what about today where are you today on the map with god in your relationship with him is this all right [Applause] are you with me now no i i want to just because i have to there were a group of people of all of the millions that literally saw the resurrected christ millions were there a handful of people saw the resurrected christ was it an illusion was it a story by others no they actually saw jesus they actually handled him they actually watched him drink milk and and eat fish and he would walk in and out of walls sometimes you wonder where those fish went but an answer for you sister sue jesus ate in that body tom has handled him jesus talked to them about 40 days on the road to emmaus he spent about six hours when historian says about six hours and 20 minutes quite detailed isn't it about six hours and 20 minutes with the boys on the road to emmaus why wasn't they in jerusalem how quickly people can walk away jesus is dead buried and resurrected and these guys are walking away from the fulfillment of the word but because they were predestinated seed jesus went after them [Applause] and he talked to them for six hours about the fulfillment of of what jesus ministry was and finally they constrained him and he went in with them and they asked him to break bread and when he broke bread they recognized that was jesus [Applause] i pray when you come to a service like this that you can recognize that that same jesus is still breaking bread [Applause] now he comes to the end of the 40 days and i don't want to spend a lot of time with that 40 days but he comes to the end of it there's about 500 people gathering audience about twice his size gathered with jesus this is going to be one of the phenomenal days in history jesus is going to ascend into the skies and he's going to take those resurrected saints that he that's brought out of hell with him or the abraham's bosom with him and they're going to ascend as well and he gives this group of people instructions to go to the upper room because there's going to come a sound of a jubilee there's coming a fresh wind and you need to be a part of it are you with me i'm going to give you power and that power is going to have authority with it and you wait on it you stay there you stay in that upper room and tell you you receive this power now god doesn't describe how it's going to come he doesn't give them instructions on how they're going to act but the same life that was in jesus [Music] that they needed he was going to breathe into them are you with me he was going to pour into them all that was in god he poured it into christ and all that was in christ he poured it into the church [Applause] they needed this it's essential it's still essential it's still the inoculation for laodicean flu where the church is rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing they can have church and don't really need god [Applause] now you can fold your hands if you want to and say i this is an elementary service but you that's got your hands folded needs this [Applause] i want that to land now think about this because this was the attitude of 380 people what you just watched happen here was the attitude of 380 people right i'm a jew i don't need that we've seen a phenomenal event hey did not we see jesus as sin well we should have everything we need we've got cows to take care of we've got farms to take care of we've got to go back to our sheep we've got businesses that we've got to take care of why i i i've got all kinds of excuses that i need to take care of why should we go to an upper room and the wind was getting ready to change [Applause] now let me just come back just for a moment in acts chapter 19 paul is speaking to the people and he's telling them have you received the holy ghost since you believed [Applause] how was she baptized why was baptized under john's baptism the messiah had came [Music] jesus said walk the earth for three years and all the miracles that have happened that will fill the whole world of miracles and then the the literal crucifixion the beating of the body and the the resurrection has happened mary magdalene and the other sisters came and witnessed it then peter came the day of pentecost comes and these people are still following john the baptist [Applause] i'm afraid too many today are still in some some pentecostal organization or or even worshiping the prophet that came we can plan them if all you saw was we can pray in them you missed the picture because god has moved incredible amounts since his leaving the angel didn't leave the pillar of fire didn't leave [Applause] and i'm telling you there's a fresh wind that is moving even now forgive me this wasn't the who's who in the 120. there's some recognizable names disciples but but even judas has he's been baptized and he's preached jesus was the messiah and he's had miracles but he turned jesus into the sanhedrin council and sold him out because he couldn't go to pentecost there's a lot of people that would do a lot of things because they can't go to pentecost and pentecost is your adoption pentecost is your your new birth pentecost sets you free no longer the old king lives on your heart but there's a new king there's a new king in there now they gather now remember peter just just days we would just say days and the breath of time is just days has denied the lord but the lord personally came to him to make sure because he's going to be the lead disciple because remember he has said flesh and blood hath not revealed this unto thee because peter had recognized that jesus was the christ now let me just say this to you well that's not such a big deal is that true people today can't still realize that jesus was god we're 2 000 years later and he's been walking through the church ages every age and it's been christ among them are you with me it's been christ among us even now and for us to turn and say well he's not god he's just a prophet or he's just a great man is to refute his divinity are you with me the greatest lie ever told was father son holy ghost baptism amen because what it does is take away from who jesus christ really is and and let me just say this to you the receiving the holy ghost is not a third person in the godhead it's jesus himself wanting to tabernacle himself on the inside of you now peter standing up with the eleven lifted up his voice unto them and said you men of judea on all the you that dwell in jerusalem be it known unto you and hearken to my words for these are not drunken as you suppose seeing it is but the third hour of the day but this is that so here is a group of people that is literally seeing the fulfillment of god pouring himself into human bodies and it's no longer up at the temple it's no longer blood of bulls and goats it's no lie under the blood of bulls and goats you could offer your perfect goat and your perfect lamb and your perfect turtle dove but the sin of that that was in your body you returned the same man only to have to repeat the process and literally oceans of blood was poured out but there was no repetitious sin but when jesus fills you with the holy ghost the blood of jesus christ washes you like you've never been washed before therefore there is no condemnation to them that are in jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit of god these men were men and women wasn't babbling and just google goggling they were speaking it in another language and those people literally later would come and said this group was galilean yet we heard him multitudes heard them in different languages it wasn't humanity it wasn't the emotion of humanity it was god pouring out his spirit and life into this 120 vessels and as the prophet of god said if mary the mother of jesus had to go to the upper room so will you [Applause] now this fulfill the prophecy of joel prophecy is god's forecast laying for future events they're going to happen you can question it you can make fun of it you can throw rocks at it but it's going to happen and it happened and it happened and yet millions of people didn't get it it happened and yet millions of people didn't get it some of you are one in a million your family you they don't see it they don't like it you just keep going back to church your life has changed and they literally hate that they didn't they didn't say nothing to you as a drunk or a prostitute or they didn't say nothing to you is when you were doing wrong and ball games were your god or these other things were your god they didn't say nothing against that but you go to church couple times a week you listen to tapes you read your bible your children are growing up in an incredible atmosphere and yet yet your very close loved ones disdain what's going on it's because the life of jesus is so living in you it convicts them and it brings them under condemnation and your atmosphere changes the atmosphere of those that work around you and then they'll mock and say things against you don't worry they did it to jesus they'll do it to you just keep walking with god peer pressure will do a lot of things to you you may be the only one at your school you may be the only one at your job thank god for that now peter begin to preach the inoculation therefore let all the house of israel know assuredly that god hath made that same jesus whom you have crucified both lord and christ now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto peter and the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do because they're causes in action and peter said unto them repent repentance is not that you got caught everybody's sorry after they get caught [Applause] politicians are sorry they're sorry they got caught and they walked in the pulpit with a hanky in their hand we've let you down no you were a sturdy stinking sinner to start off with and you're just sorry you got caught just give it a few weeks all of that sorrow get off of you be doing the very same thing all over again if you don't truly repent and turn aside from your old ways it will be a repetitive habit that will only come back in your life and you'll consciously struggle listen people sit for 30 and 40 years in seats in churches and they still have birth issues because they never did it right [Applause] they never did it right listen we're not a halfway house [Applause] we're not a place where you come and learn to live with your demons this is a transformation [Applause] sure house love the sinner but we hate the sin now look we all want to go to heaven could we have a unanimous vote on that we all want to go to heaven nobody wants to die but we all want to go to heaven but if you read in your scriptures there's an incredible list of people that won't make it in heaven there will not be a murderer a drunkard an idolater an adulterer there will not be none of that sin in heaven if you arrive and you you've wound up at a las vegas looking outfit you've wound up in hell that's not heaven are you with me somebody got offended that jesus could come the other day jesus jesus showed up at your house and opened the refrigerator and there was wine there somebody actually got offended it when i said that well you know let me just say this to you jesus don't even need to show up at your house he knows he knows and there's going to be a day let me just say this to you many will come to him and say lord did we not prophesy in your name didn't we have a holy ghost filled ministry in your name didn't we have miracles in your name and jesus says depart from me i never knew you so don't you get your eyes on humanity because preachers will fail you men will fail you women will fail you don't you get your eyes on failures you keep your eyes on jesus are we okay am i okay just a word of warning when i have trouble in the pulpit i'm not going to walk away no more i'm going to work my way through it so you help me work my way through it the other day i had an mri one doctor calls me and tells me that the temple tumor is growing and so in three months we'll be doing pet scans and those kind of scans we see growth we can't explain it but we see growth the next day i get a call from my uh cancer doctors and she said yeah we see this but but it's not cancer and matter of fact we want to take you off of chemo for a week just to give your body a break and so you have the same test you have the same test and different doctors look at the same test and give you different opinions now that's nothing new [Applause] so you have the same test and you have different doctors look at it and give you different results well so i'm going to go to a church that fits me really that's an interesting observation i want to fit the word now sometimes it becomes kind of a difficult deal because king james can be rough so that means that we're going to rewrite the bible now in rewriting the bible there's 40 different 40 000 different translations and everybody's got their own opinion because they didn't like what the word actually said [Applause] you know in china we had a deal where we had to rewrite the bible because their bible didn't have the blood of jesus christ in it are you with me and their bible took away the power of god in the people but you give them the real word and there'll come a fresh wind that'll blow through you can send them to prison that won't stop them you can take their churches away that won't stop them [Applause] come on church a real believer anchors his soul in the word of god and a revelation drops in their heart and the kingdom of hell can't shake that away from them [Applause] [Music] [Applause] yesterday morning and i'm going to just take just a moment here just to relax but yesterday morning i woke up to a video in my in one of my uh text links and it was a video of me preaching and i was preaching in switzerland and i call out brother guido which to this audience would be judo and i call out brother guido and while i'm preaching on god getting his own and god will not lose a one and god will chase down that predestinated seed and i call brother guido specifically that god will go after your children he'll not lose one and the clip stops and he said and this this text was from isaiah vonderbrunt now isaiah was a a good-looking man i don't have man fancies but he's a nice-looking man and he's chased the dollar he's chased the world he's chased things in life and he's avoided christ raised in a good christian home a tremendous preacher for a daddy and he's just avoided that relationship with god and all seems lost he's came to a spot in his life they're divorced he's divorced from his wife and and then later later brother guido actually talks to me about his son isaiah and and he says i've got a real burden for him that was after the meeting he begins to share that with me and so isaiah and i and i'm going to do my best to have my facts straight isaiah wants to get married and wants his daddy to marry him gido asked me said would you marry him i said absolutely marry him to his wife i said and he's going to find christ i got pictures in a little while of gaydo and his wife and guido and his son and his wife marrying beautiful days sun shining and time goes on ditto comes to north carolina in that meeting brother guido was standing to the left right that night had just the prayer line changed and i felt led to pray for the preachers boy things can get sticky when you start praying for preachers but there are some preachers that really need to be prayed for and i turned and and guido was standing about where you are brother john and he was stan and he was just standing there and he had his hands in the air and i told him about a letter that was in his briefcase i heard i heard brother andrew speak on curses last night how satan tries to curse you let me just remind you a curse is only a curse if you believe it [Applause] a curse is only a curse if you believe it you can turn that thing on its heels [Music] are you with me one night a preacher cursed laid a curse tried to curse me and said i was going to be financially unstable the rest of my life and i turned and i said no sir god's promised he'd bless everything that i touch and god's proved himself faithful [Applause] and because i've got some great business with i got a partner his name is jesus he should be in your marriage he should be in your job he should be in your business he should be your lawyer he should be your doctor he should be your psychologist he's everything he's got the answer to every need in your life hallelujah he is the answer brother i'm looking for an answer jesus is the answer brother guido is at the next meeting that we go to and that night i had had two preachers fight me from the pulpit and they'd set back to the back and i told them to let your brakes off sitting in the audience about 800 people let your brakes off finally i walked out behind the pulpit and i said if you don't let your brakes off i'm going to call you by name then let their brakes off and then i preached everybody don't have that but i'm very very conscious of those things you see they were exposed and from that time they couldn't hide themselves as imposters in the message and they're gone now they're gone they're gone i made a statement in that pulpit i'm being very reverent now because no man does this i said if god can't work out here he'll work behind the the we're in a huge auditorium he'll work behind these curtains and i prayed for just a few people one was sister charnock that just was killed in a car wreck along with her son-in-law and daughter and she had sugar diabetes and was healed instantly and i i just stepped i i may have been wearing this suit i don't know but i stepped behind the pulpit and matthew was there and howden was there some others were there to gather me and take me to the office and do what we have to do but i just stepped behind them and you know even as i said those words i didn't realize what god was getting ready to do i'm saying some things here now how many times do we sit in church as a body believer and don't recognize god's moving like he is this morning and so i stepped behind the curtains and i stepped toward matthew and all of a sudden i just turned i felt him i just felt that fresh wind and i turned and when i did caitlyn was there and i just went and said some very personal things to her it was just for her and then nate was there and i turned and i spoke to him some very personal things and i just spoke to them and then at the end of speaking to them i said god's going to give you your baby that's not just a projection but a year a year later charlie's born i stepped up and prayed for a couple of more and then and then then i prayed for guido and gato standing there and when i speak to guido and i just say a couple of things to him very personal things to him no needing even saying those things now but very personal things to go to and he said that's thus saith the lord and then i said dedo there's a train coming for you don't be afraid to step on that train and in just a couple of months brother guido's gone to be with the lord you with me and then i turn let me just drop this to you i turned and there stood brother joe green's brother-in-law terry a very good friend you say i've heard this before still means something and terry standing there and he's he's been in church for for decades i don't say that remorsefully he's been there decades and he don't have a new birth your name could be called here decades he said in church and he ain't made a move but a wind was blowing fresh wind was blowing and he just he just looked me in the eyes brother meadows i'll never forget this all the days of my life he said i can serve a god like that i can serve a god like that how many of you were standing behind that curtain brother alden where you stand was you there brother matthew was there as witnesses jesus always had witnesses with him and i just grabbed terry we'd been friends for forever and i just grabbed him he'd let me hunt in his tree stand but he needed more than religion he needed god [Applause] he needed god your family to them you needed god it's more than just being a good old boy you know the good old boys club don't get you eternal life they don't get you eternal life you need a fresh wind we saw that this week men and women get a fresh wind at easter we saw a fresh wind come through the building and prophecy to speak in tongues and prophesy and talk about a total surrender to god we'll give you ultimate victory let me just say this you without a total surrender and terry just surrendered it all right there and i just hugged him i hugged him and i knew the change had happened sister betty sister betty said i walked in with one man and i walked out with another how important was that service i'll tell you how important that service was in a few weeks he finds out he's got cancer and in a couple of months his his esophagus and all of that burst inside of his lungs no way to save him but from the time that he had that moment with christ till the night that he bled out he was listening to the tapes and he just kept saying brother ron's my favorite preacher and he would listen to me over and over and over again i'm not ashamed of that i'm thankful i was a part of a man's [Applause] life i haven't forgot you isaiah i know you're watching and isaiah all of this has come together and guidos got on the train but god didn't forget his promise and god began to work on isaiah and he goes to a meeting that timothy pruitt is preaching in belgium and timothy pruitt is preaching on the birth and as he's preaching i something gets a hold of isaiah and isaiah finds himself at the altar and before long his wife became converted are you with me when you come to a spot in your life that nothing else is important but having an experience with jesus christ he sent me that note in that video and he said i've spent my time since then digging golden nuggets that i've missed all of these years i don't want you to miss none of these golden nuggets don't set none through none of these services and come to the point that it's just good entertainment not just cause you've got good singing and and good song leaders not because you're part of a certain family in a church that don't give you eternal life what gives you eternal life is you and jesus you and jesus when you have that moment i think i've seen you before and i'm glad to have you here amen god bless you god bless you this young man sits here because he don't want to miss nothing he's a phenomenal young man he's a phenomenal singer raised in a phenomenal home but he don't want to miss nothing that jesus has got for him it'll make you a phenomenal husband too i stood outside on the porch today i just had spoken to brother stephen and sister kara and i walked across the i walked across back to the to the office and i just kept hearing these words and they too shall be one and they too shall be one was he talking about a wedding a real wedding brother ron is he talking about this no i'm i think a union is going on here a real union where you and christ it's not a fighter wrestle your way listen marriage is not to be wrestled with it's not to be fussed about it's it's not to to spend your days on who's right and who's wrong and just being stupid for 50 years don't make that a happy marriage when you've missed your opportunity at having a wonderful relationship i'm preaching i'm preaching are you with me chasing the dollar is not what it's about driving the best car living in the best house i don't care if you live in a railroad car with tacky buttons on it you don't have to talk god don't need to talk on you for 50 years to try to get you to live right if you just surrender your life to god whoa if you just surrender your life to god and just say god i'm yours yours i'm giving myself away i'm giving myself to you fresh wind breathe upon us i watched those girls dancing last week and they were dancing you can keep standing because i'm done the musicians can come and i watched them dancing and dancing and dancing and dancing and i watched them and it was not some made up choreographed fleshly move because i i dislike all that i don't like artificial i don't i like real i like real real really really i like real i don't like pretend christians i like real hollywood don't have the best actors most of them sit in churches i like real so i told brother tim i said brother tim what i witnessed was scriptural it's a sign of the coming of the lord now whether you know it or not god sent his messenger he's gave us the inoculation sodom is here you don't have to wait on it sodom's here your government's corrupt the leaders are in their place [Applause] blue and purple the leaders are in their place that's purple for the sake of argument the color that she had on was that color and it was purple brother brown described what she would be what position she would hold what color she would have on i don't think you need to argue with that no more [Applause] the reason that you would even argue with it is because you can't live right [Applause] the reason people didn't want brother branham as a prophet is because they couldn't live what he was preaching but it was a fresh wind [Applause] god's not just on paper ipads he's just not on pictures on the wall here's where he's at here's where he's at and it's about separating the people well brother ron kovitt was horrible really there's people today that have not been able to be in a live service like this for a year for a year all over the world europe is still many other places to shut down canada just shut down some places other places shut down who knows we may have to do it again one of these days i don't know i hope not i love love's live services but let me just say covered being as bad as it was let me say worse is coming it shut people in homes and they found out i really love you i really love my mate or i really hate her they found out that they really needed to love their teachers because now they have to become the teacher and what a horrible job some of them didn't survive covet and they went right back in the world now there's a worse flu than covet it's called laodicea and it tells you that you don't need god and you can do your own thing well let me just tell you tribulations coming and during that three years you couldn't get to church but during that three years you'll find out that you need god so bad you're willing to die for him and god will give you grace to get you through it the guy that you hated that you you just didn't want to hear him preach anymore you'd wish that you was able to be in a service now i haven't wound my way out of out of my original text 380 people had something better to do than go to the upper room of you've got friends loved ones neighbors that are doing the same thing today but god deposited something on the inside of you and you said i'm not gonna miss it i can't wait till
