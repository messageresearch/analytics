of the gift that you placed in my life lord and speak directly to these people today lord i pray you take as as you did that stone that day and guided it lord right to to the head of goliath that you'll take the word this morning it'll be directed laser guided right to every situation right right to every john of oppression that's holding your people and lord may today your people find freedom in the house of god lord i pray that you'll bless your word bless your people that gathered now lord as we just lay ourselves aside and ask you to take control father in jesus name we pray amen and amen hallelujah it's wonderful to be in the house of the lord this morning if you have your bibles and you have turned with me to exodus the second chapter we'll read a couple places and exit this and i'll let you have your seat and we'll read a couple more places hey man i just want to thank you for being such a wonderful audience to minister to you know it's sometimes the people sitting there don't recognize how much of a part you play and and you're a wonderful congregation to preach to the pool and your and your sincere hunger for the word is a blessing and you make it so easy from for me and the ministers to preach here you're wonderful and god bless you very much exodus 2 verse 23 it says here and it came to pass in process of time it's going to be something we look at a lot today the process of time that the king of egypt died and the children of israel's side by reason of the bondage and they cried and their cry came up unto god by reason of the bondage and god heard their groaning and god remembered his covenant with abraham with isaac and with jacob we're going to go down now to chapter 11 in exodus chapter 11 verse 1. and the lord said unto moses yet will i bring one plague more upon pharaoh and upon egypt afterwards he will let you go hence when he shall let you go he shall surely thrust you out hence all together amen you may have your seats this morning we ask that the lord would add his blessings to the reading of his word we're going to turn over now to mark the fifth chapter and the first verse and we're going to read a couple portions of scripture here mark 5 and 1 says and they came over onto the other side of the sea into the country of the gadarenes and when he was come out of the ship immediately there met him out of the tombs of man with an unclean spirit who had his dwelling among the tombs and no man could bind him no not with chains because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains and the chains had been plucked asunder by him and the fetters broken in pieces neither could any man tame him and always night and day he was in the mountains and in the tombs crying and cutting himself with stones but when he saw jesus afar off he ran and worshiped him and cried with a loud voice and said what have i to do with thee jesus thou son of the most high god i adjure thee by god that thou torment me not for he said unto him come out of the man thou unclean spirit and he asked him what is thy name and he answered saying my name is legion for we are many and he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country one thing that stood out to me as i read this is it said that no man combined him and that was the problem all along is all these people wanted to bind him but jesus wanted to set him free and the problem he didn't need binding he needed loosen and jesus come to do just that we're going to look one more portion matthew 8 and 29 it says and behold they cried out saying what have we to do with thee jesus thou son of god art thou come hither to torment us before the time and there was a good way off from them a herd of swine feeding so the devils besought him saying if thou cast us out suffer us to go away into the herd of swine what i want to speak to you for a little bit today on is the plaguing of satan the plaguing of satan it's time amen it's time for us to to to turn the tables on the devil as it were what we know as we read through the scripture is that god's timing is perfect god is not a god of time however he is a god of perfect timing all right we we are as humans we are time beings and we become anxious and we expect things to happen at a certain time and yet our god doesn't operate in in that manner he doesn't have feelings of what when when is this going to happen he doesn't have those feelings he doesn't have feelings of how he doesn't have feelings of what if why is that why can god operate like that is because he is eternal and he already knows the end from the beginning he knew each and every one of you that would be sitting here today he knew where you would sit he knew what kind of troubles you would have this morning get into the house of god he saw the troubles and the straws and the little fusses and all that he knew all of that none of those things snuck up on him this morning and not only did he know you would be here he knew exactly what you would have need of from this service today aren't you glad today that there's nothing that sneaks up on god there's no situation where he goes oh no what do i do now he's already provided exactly what it is you have need of for your life today he is jehovah jireh he is our provider so so god isn't worried today because he knows the how he knows why and he knows when the when question with god is already settled it's already taken care of it's not a debate there's no worry there's no anxiety because there are special appointed predestinated times for all things it's already been set aside we as individuals have certain appointments with god for the things that we have need of in our lives and that moment is already set genesis 18 14 is there any to anything too hard for the lord at the time appointed i will return unto thee exodus 9 5 and the lord appointed a set time acts acts 7 17 but when the time of the promise drew not so if you'll notice all these things were already predestinated set times that god already knew when it was going to happen so there was no worry in him of when when is this going to take place and look these exact same things apply to your life as an individual there was a time that this message was going to cross your path there was a moment in time where you were going to give your life to jesus it was time and if you haven't done that yet let me say it's time it's time today to give your heart to the lord he's here today calling you there was a time in your life where you were going to receive the baptism of the holy ghost it was time it had reached the appointed time there's a moment where you're healing that you've been holding on to becomes materialized and you step into it it's time for for the for the fulfillment of that promise and god's timing once again is perfect timing when it becomes time for something to happen that god has set in order there is absolutely nothing that is going to stop it because according to god it's time not i feel like it's time i've been holding on his time is time but when it reaches the time there is nothing no devil no demon of hell that is gonna stop what is time to happen in your life it doesn't matter how much he fights it doesn't matter how much he hinders it doesn't matter the struggle when it's time for your deliverance he cannot stop you i say it's time this morning i say it's time for us to turn the tables on the enemy this morning when the time of the promise draws nigh when the time of fulfillment draws nigh i want to encourage you this morning that whatever it is you've been holding on for for the return of your child for the birth of a child for the baptism of the holy ghost for your healing i say don't let go now the time of the promise has drawn now it's time for fulfillment don't let go of the promise now when we're right at the doorstep of fulfillment the woman at the well had her time the devil had done everything he could do he had covered her up in sin and trespassed and filth to where she couldn't even hang out with other people he tried to keep her away from the well that day he knew where jesus was he tried to keep her there he tried to send her down this road he tried to cause this distraction but he couldn't stop her it was time it was time for her to be at the well there was a set time mary magdalene there was a time for her deliverance there was a moment and i say today it's time we step into our moment it's time we recognize and we play the part it's time this morning it was time for her to meet jesus and because of that their time running her life was over their time was finished [Music] it's time i believe there are seasons for everything i believe that god lays things on ministers hearts for a reason i believe that certain ministers come by certain places in a certain time for a certain reason i believe it's time this morning i believe he showed up here this weekend because it's your time for what it is that you have need of not i showed up here this weekend i don't amount to a hill of beans but when he shows up when he comes in the place that's all it look one moment in the presence of the angel one moment in the presence of god it changes everything forever all you need is a moment all you need is your time all you got to do is recognize today it's my time it's my moment and i'm gonna grab a hold to it it's time this morning for your healing it's time for those things you've been holding back for you to surrender and lay those things down it's time to lay down your hurts it's time to move on beyond those scars and those things that's held you back from being the christian that you know you ought to be or that god's calling you to it's time today to move on and when the time has come satan can do nothing to stop it in the scripture we read it was exodus time it was time for the deliverer to show up the promise the time of the promise had drawn nigh and it did not matter what pharaoh put on the people it did not matter what pharaoh tried to do it was time for the exodus and there was nothing that pharaoh could do to stop it i say we've reached rapture time it's going home time it's time for the fulfillment of all things and there's nothing the devil can do to stop it there is perfect timing for everything our god is always working the word would tell us that he is never slack concerning his promises he is going to fulfill all that he has promised we see there in the book of isaiah chapter 7 that he said behold a virgin shall conceive and that would lay dormant there in the scripture for 700 years just laying there well when's it going to happen when's it going to happen at the predestinated time at the time set aside by almighty god but there did come a time of fulfillment there came a day that there was a little virgin who was willing to step into that and when the when the angel appeared to her she didn't go well no i can't do that surely she said be it unto me lord according to the promise she was willing to step in and play her part just as we spoke about last night there was a deliverer promised there in the beginning in every type and every shadow pointed to it but there came a time of fulfillment man had lost everything and the law that the man had asked for had failed they had not been able to keep it but it was time for a promised redeemer and then he comes and he gives his life there on calvary he goes down to hell he rises again he sends back the baptism of the holy ghost what for what were all these things for it was happening because it was time for the fulfillment of all things there in the old testament he fulfilled all of it it was time that adam's race who had lost everything would now have everything returned back to them in waters of separation brother branham says and when christ came to become man here on earth and be a kinsmen redeemer he redeemed man back to everything he lost in the fall christ restored it to him in the kinsman redeemership when he died at calvary your health your eternal life everything that you lost in the fall christ redeems you to it for he's your kinsmen redeemer your health your strength and everything belongs back to you tonight through the lord jesus he become kinfolk to take away sin and sickness everything the human race lost in adam was redeemed when christ god himself became kinfolk with the human race redeemed it back to his maker all that was lost he redeemed back again he goes on to say all things are possible to them that believe we've got the untapped resources of god at our hands to display god we are sons and daughters of god when god made man he made him a god he gave him dominion over the earth but his fallen estate dropped that but when they lost by adam it was restored by christ he said if you you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you said shall come to pass you can have what you said all things whatsoever you desire when you pray believe you receive it you shall have it amen he restored to us all that was lost in adam god is depending on us one more he was the first one who made who had jurisdiction over everything in the earth over all animals he lost his power and we're taught in the bible that what the first adam lost the second adam christ restored again to the human race then friends if that's so ministers what's the matter with the church today that's what i want to know if christ was the missing link between god and man and he's come to hook god and man together again then what's the matter today he says it's because of unbelief it's because now why'd you read all that that that to us brother aaron i just want you to show that everything that was lost has been given back i want you to know that today you're sitting in a place where everything adam lost has been restored back to you again and you do have the right to speak you do have the right to stand on the word you do have the right to take the words of god and put it on your lips all was restored brother branham said that adam didn't operate the weed and he would speak to the tree and tell it to move he would speak just like the second adam and those things have been restored today to you to where you have the right to take it upon your lips and speak the word once again and i say this morning it's time that we begin to operate in that manner we know that that thing was those things were restored there at the cross but once again man allowed reason and doubt and unbelief to rob them of all that of all that authority and we go into the dark ages and there's a scripture that i will restore and i know i dealt with that last night but there came a time for the reformation to begin there came a time for justification under luther there came a time for justification under wesley there came a time for the restoration of the gifts there was a promise laying in the scriptures malachi 4 there came a time for the fulfillment of that and brother branham came on the scene and he stepped in there to that part and i would say he did an awesome job i would say that he fulfilled that well he ran his race well he delivered this message he dedicated his life for it but for what for what purpose for us to sit around and talk about what god used to do for us to let us sit on a shelf in the form of tapes and sit on there as a form of books and to talk about it and debate it no he sent the message so that you could be the message so that you can live the message so that you could put it in action not just sit around and talk but you take the third pull power and you operate it the third pool operating in men and women that have been restored back to the original third pull power in you we keep looking for the fulfillment of things as if we play no part in that fulfillment but it's time for you to play your part the message is so full of power and you have been given the authority to use it it's been put in your hands in my name they shall cast out devils be it unto me lord be it unto me today i will have a church without spot or wrinkle be it unto me lord let me play that part in that church the works that i do shall you do also be it unto me lord it's time that i step in and begin to play my part abraham and his seed jesus said does it not say in your own laws ye or gods why do you condemn me then if your own law says you're god's he was given a domain the domain was the earth the whole earth is groaning waiting now for the manifestation of the sons of god if i'm a branham i'm a branham i'm part of a branham and if a man is a son of god he's made in the image of god given the domain here on earth to rule this earth like god ruled it and if the second adam proved it amen he stopped nature peace be still amen cursed the fig tree certainly he was a man yet he was god he was a manifested son of god that's what we're to be one of these days i say it's time i say it's time that we take these things off the page and we take these things and we begin to live them out we begin to operate in what we've been called to operate in god once again in flesh god once again in his bride once again somebody on the earth saying i'm doing the works of my father brother brown would say she has thus saith the lord and she knows what he wants done with it well i think he wants us to debate this quote i think he wants us to argue about what he really meant here in marriage and divorce no no i think we've debated things long enough i say it's time that we take the land i say it's time that we cross over he's already went beyond he said the land is there the land is real there's the holy ghost in this land there's healing in this land there's deliverance in this land your joys in this land cross over today and take the land and quit talking about it the land is yours it was put in your hands it's for you created for you go take the land this morning put the word in action put it in action be it unto me lord be it unto me according to that word let me play my part it's time it's time to play my part demons that held the woman at the well the demons that held mary magdalene they met jesus face to face and i believe that once again demons are having to deal with god in flesh once again they're meeting up with flesh that god is tabernacling on the inside of manifested sons of god doing the will of the father you have the power of the spoken word who you look i don't need you to see it in me i don't need you to see it in brother ron i don't need you to see it in brother andrew i need you to see it in you i need you to see it in you because brother ron ain't always going to be with you on the boat when the waves come brother andrew ain't always going to be there with you brother branham's already going off the scene your favorite preacher ain't going to always be there with you but i'll tell you what you will always be with you and so you need to recognize i have the authority i have the right to speak it's been restored back to me peace be still satan take your hands off i have the rights to do that today hallelujah but if there's something over the mountain that you've got to get over there to do the will of god you can't get over it under it around it and yet something in your heart is telling you to go you speak the word don't you doubt and maybe when you speak the word one little grain of sand will fall but it's on its road the next day a spoonful may drop the next day a tea cup full you'll never notice it but if you will just hold steady knowing that it's being done after a while the whole thing will fall look we gotta we gotta quit binding it up brother brown said in one quote he said it's time that you turn it loose we got to turn it loose today time for people to quit binding up the moving of the spirit time for people to quit putting god in a box time to put put quit putting god in the past or putting god in the future i said we need to turn it loose today in our life turn it loose today in this service turn it loose today for everything that you have need of take your faith and turn it loose today let it loose that same rock that killed goliath if he had just sat there and twirled it and twirled it and twirled it it had never done one thing but there had to come a time where he let it loose and once you let it loose god will pick that thing up and he'll carry it to its mark it'll slay that john you'll have victory like never before but you've got to let it loose today turn it loose quit twirling it quit talking about it quit debating about it quit doubting it and let it loose this morning turn it loose hallelujah [Applause] we saw in our opening scripture that it came to pass in the process of time israel sighed and cried by reason of their taskmaster and god heard their cries and he remembered his promise the book of acts tells us that the time of the promise had drawn nigh there was a promise of a deliverer in egypt and that time came for him to step on the scene and that's what i'm telling you today is it's time we're here but it's time to step on the scene the prophet would talk about recognizing he was in a vision but he had to play his part he had to know when to step in when to speak this had to be in place that had to be in place i'm telling you it's in place somebody has to recognize we're there it's time for me to step on the scene and begin to do what i've been called to do in egypt they had reached the time exodus 3 12 and he said certainly i will be with thee and this shall be a token unto thee that i have sent thee when thou has brought forth the people out of egypt you shall serve god upon this mountain at this point before he's even gone down into egypt the defeat of pharaoh and the deliverance of the of israel is all settled it's a finished work at this point because he's already told them you're going to come back to this mountain and worship me here it's settled there's nothing else to debate about none of it was uncertain god plainly says i've come down to the liver i will send you i will be with you and you will come back to this mountain it's done it's a finished work but it did not happen overnight he went right back there a week later he wasn't there the next day brother brown says there was pharaoh who raised up who didn't know joseph and that was the beginning of the beginning that was the beginning of the exodus really i thought the exodus was them leaving it was but that was the beginning when a pharaoh rose up that knew not joseph and when that thing began to form under a political power began to form god began to get ready the iniquity of the amorites was fulfilled the time that he promised abraham was fulfilled and the time of deliverance was at hand so what we have to recognize and look at we can apply this to us today is that the exodus was a process there were struggles in the exodus there were great burdens in the exodus there were very difficult times during the exodus don't allow the difficult times that are surrounding us the sickness the hardships the evil in politics the whole world going mad to distract you from the fact that we are in the coming of the lord we are in the process of the coming of the lord it has already begun we're not looking for it we are in it the shout the voice the trump the time of deliverance had arrived despite the struggles despite the hardships despite the impersonators despite all those things there was a word that was already spoken i am come down to deliver the promise was already spoken look the coming of the lord is a process we are in the coming of the lord we are in the time of his coming yes there are trials yes there are hardship there is mind battles and there is sickness but there is a word already spoken and despite satan's best efforts i will have a god there will be a rapture you are that rapture and there's nothing he can do about it because it's time the time of fulfillment is here it is now we are in it it's already spoke you are the spoken word bride of jesus christ you are victorious you are overcomers hallelujah the word has already declared it and the time of the promise has drawn now people think that the rapture or the coming of the lord is a moment in the twinkling of an eye event that's the body change in a moment of twinkling an eye but the coming of the lord is a process that we are currently a part of so placing ourselves at this point and looking back to the exodus what are we supposed to be doing at this point just before the excess how are things supposed to be operating how are we to carry ourselves what is our example of how we should operate at this point in history and sometimes i believe that we've allowed things to get a little twisted and allowed things to get a little bit backwards because we've allowed satan to convince us that he is in control of our lives because we are in his eden and that part is a truth this is satan's eden and so because he has control of satan's eden he wants to think you just have to bear this you're in my eating you're just going to have to deal with this you're in my eating no you're just going to have to do what it is i i say i'm going to make you struggle the whole way you are barely going to get in you are going to be tormented because you are in my eating and next thing you know you're saying oh i'm not a very good christian i don't have very much faith i mean i believe but i'm just barely getting by i'm just barely making it where's that suit coat cause i'm gonna need that uh handkerchief out of the pocket i'm sorry i'm i'm sweating down up here i forgot to get it out he makes you think you're barely going to make it in but this isn't truth at all because the bride isn't a barely make it in kind of people bride is the bride is overcomers we are people that are going to overcome in this age the truth is that you are on speaking terms again with almighty god the truth is that the pillar of fire is in the church once again the truth is that flesh once again is taking the word of god and putting it on human lips and dictating rights to the enemy that is what the truth is tonight the truth is that satan is the defeated foe he's the one that's barely hanging on he's the one hanging on by the skin of his teeth you're the overcomer you're the victor you're the one in charge you're the winner satan is cast down that's the truth of it listen i'm gonna tell you we get so caught up in terminology and facts and whatnot you can have every fact in the world and it be fact and it still not be the truth that's the truth that's also a fact but listen let me give you some facts fact is i was a sinner fact is i was lost without hope fact is i turned my back on the lord jesus i'd walked away from this message i lived the life of a ranked sinner those are facts fact is the devil thought he had me but the truth is i'm a son of god the truth is my name was written on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world you can line up every fact and everything but the truth is i'm gonna make it the truth is i'm gonna rapture the truth is he paid the price that's the truth oh it may be a fact i'm sick today but the truth is by his stripes you are healed that's the truth that's the truth today hallelujah the truth is i've already made it hallelujah hallelujah glory to god that's the truth today when god was made flesh in jesus christ satan's kingdom was tormented at every turn everywhere jesus went satan was cast down every demon that jesus faced was cast out death was defeated everywhere jesus went he tormented devils and here we are once again god in the flesh once again on earth god going to work on monday god going to school on monday tormenting devils not letting him enjoy in his own eating that you are the one thing that's prayer that's keeping him from having complete total control you think it's insane now you wait till the bride leaves from here you wait till we leave from here what's holding it back you are because god fled god on flesh once again saying no you've gone far enough no i'm not gonna do that no i'm not gonna bow down to your images you can heat it up seven times hotter but i'm gonna stand i will not bow to the images of this world because god in flesh once again is here tormenting and plaguing the enemy tormenting devils and the devil wants you to accept him tormenting you that's not how jesus operated i never one time see jesus going i can't deal with this one no i'm about now you're right i'm saying no sir no absolutely not and we once again jesus made flesh on the earth bone of his bone flesh of his flesh power of his power we're not backing down either we're not giving in either we are to manifest jesus christ you know somewhere along the way that got twisted too that you're just supposed to love everything about everybody you know people get hung up on the love and forgiveness part and that's part of it that's a big part of it lord i needed it and lord i'm still going to give it there's no doubt about it but some folks have turned it into some kind of hippie love where we accept everybody's little pet peeves and everybody's little pet sins and we're afraid to call it out because that's just how they are bless your heart listen the same jesus that ate with the sinners and the publicans and forgave everybody also plotted a whip he also played in the whip and said we ain't going to tolerate that in the house of god we ain't going to deal with that what happened to where we love people so much that we help them the way jesus helped them and we plant a whip and say i'll help you get rid of that spirit i'll help you get rid of that demon let's run it out of the house of god today hallelujah sometimes we need to plant a whip in the house of god bless your heart i'm so sorry that you just came over it's okay yeah it no it's not okay it's not okay and we have these little cliches that well i'll pray for you look i'm gonna tell you something i don't know why i'm here but here we are some people don't ever get deliverance from things because they don't want deliverance from things they enjoy the petting look some people are depressed and they want you to press too at least i feel like they do how many of y'all ever seen winnie the pooh i know we don't watch nothing how many of y'all have ever seen winnie the pooh we got so many eeyore christians walking around in the message i tell you uh nobody loves me pastor didn't call me oh man he's preaching two hours again oh my goodness come on here snap out of it the sun's shining the pillar of fires in the house of god we got something to be happy about we got something to rejoice above come on er get with the program there's an exodus happening come on let's go you can do it you can make it you're a child of god too hallelujah [Applause] i don't even know where to go from here i ain't got no more cartoon references so we yeah let's move on before i keep you how do we display the life of christ john 14 12 the works that i do shall you do also it's time we recognize that satan's had enough time in the driver's seat he's had enough time tormenting you he's had enough time playing the part of taskmaster slave driver torment or oppressor look the devil whips on you every chance he gets i'm telling you you got the opportunity to whip back a little bit today it's time for you to take the whip and whip back on him the children of israel were whipped daily he was their tormentor pharaoh was there tormented for a season but the time of the promise drew nigh the pillar of fire came on the scene the word of the lord came to a prophet and it began to change who the tormentor was it was time for satan's kingdom to be plagued for a while listen moses stepped into that presence i'm just trying to get you to recognize what authority you have he came into that presence that's different from what happens with us moses came into that presence but under the blood of bulls and goats that presence could not come into him moses comes into that presence moses had the word you are the word let that sink in for a minute because that couldn't come in and dwell on the inside of him because he's under the blood of bulls and goats and yet under the blood of bulls and goats he goes down to satan's kingdom and he begins to plague him what are we supposed to do right before the exodus brother aaron it's time to start plaguing the devil it's time to begin to put things on your lips and call for what you have need of that's what we're supposed to do right before the rapture we are to plague his kingdom we are to ruin his eden to where it gets to the point that he's so sick and tired of it he finally says take your stuff take your peace take your joy take your kids and just get out of here i'm sick and tired of you ruining my kingdom i've spent years creating this eden i've got everybody bowing down everybody's telling me what i want to hear they're caving in to the lgbtq elemental p of all these things going on in the world today but there's somebody says not me i'll stand for truth i'll stand for the message i'll stand for what's right i won't bow down to your image i'll stand he says i've had enough just take your stuff take it and get out of here just leave it's time to torment the devil it's time to look him in the face and say no you've whipped me long enough [Applause] the children of israel began to cry out they'd had enough they were tired of bondage they were sick of their taskmasters sick of fear sick of depression sick of anxiety all the things that the enemy was trying to put on them sick of losing their children you had those like amram that begin to cry out to god begin to remind god of his promises god loves to be reminded of his promises he loves it and amram and begins to crowd listen we need some more amram says hey god it's time god has time we're sick of being here we're sick of this world listen things were bad things are bad now i know but that's not our focus but things were bad israel was tormented constantly every day all day i want to tell you that we were just on the verge of the tables being turned just on the verge of the of the oppressor becoming the oppressed the one who had done the whipping the one who had destroyed their children the one who had made them sick the one who had made them captain was about to have the wrath of god poured out on him his kingdom was about to be plagued and how was god going to do it how is he going to do it how is he going to do this it's just moses but see the thing is the word had already been spoken the word had already been spoken all the way back with abraham in genesis 15 13 he said unto abram no assurity that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs and shall serve them and they shall afflict them four hundred years and also that nation whom they shall serve will i judge it's already been so look satan didn't know what he had coming to him i want to tell you today there's been a word spoke over you there's been prophecy spoken over you and i'd just like to let the devil know today you don't know what's coming to you you don't know what's about to be poured out on your head there is a people recognizing who they are what authority they hold they're not scared to take the word of god on their lips they're not scared to take the whip out of the devil's hand and turn it around and begin whipping on the devil prophet of god says sure right here in the last days a predestinated church knowing where they're standing sowed with the seed the holy spirit in the church satan be careful he says satan be careful he don't know what's coming to him hallelujah the tormentor is about to be tormented how how's he gonna do it god's gonna come down and god's gonna thunder that's not how he did it god was going to use the lips of a mortal man to repay pharaoh for every evil he had ever put on israel under the blood of bulls and goats he was going to take a man that was willing to stand there and speak the word of god and repay the enemy listen the devil has not gotten away with one thing in your life he will repay every single thing he will recompense him time upon time he has not gone away there's not a single trial there's not a lost child there's not a sleepless night laying on a pillow full of fear and anxiety there is nothing he has put in your life that the lord hasn't seen and said we'll repay that that'll be repaid listen satan has not gotten away with one thing in your life and now the plaguing of satan is at hand how's he gonna do it you you're gonna do it oh come on don't let that choke you you're gonna do it if moses could do that under the bloods of goats bulls and goats what about you standing tonight redeemed under the blood of the lord jesus christ the perfect blood that wipes everything away you stand tonight spotless as though you never did it in the first place i say stand up and you call for the plagues and you call for him to be poured out on the head of your enemy i'll not stop short or you can go but not your children no sir let me pour another one out oh you can go but you're going out sick no sir let me plague you a little bit more oh you can go but you're barely going to make it no i'm going my family's going we're all going and we're going out full of the blessings of god i'm not stopping short i'll pour plagues out until you say go hallelujah you're gonna have to speak you're gonna have to recognize his time you're gonna have to step into the vision hallelujah hallelujah exodus 6 6 wherefore say unto the children of israel i am the lord i will bring you out from under the burdens of the egyptians now notice how he words these things i'm going to do it i will bring you out i will rid you of their bondage i will redeem you with stretched out on and with great judgment i will take you to me i will be to you a god you shall know that i am the lord it's all god doing it look down exodus 3 20. i will stretch out my hand and smite egypt i will do it in the midst thereof but now let's look over in exodus 4 21. i'll let you catch up here he's already said i'm going to do it i'm going to do it i'm going to do and okay how's he going to do it and the lord said unto moses when thou goest to return to egypt see that thou do all those wonders before pharaoh which i have put in thine i'm gonna do it but i'm gonna do it through you we're gonna plug pharaoh so much that he's gonna kick you out but i'm gonna do it through i put it in your hands to take care of this it's god doing the deliverance it's the power of god it's his signs and wonders but it's in your hands it's you that's gonna show the enemy it's you that's gonna proclaim it's jesus again he's here again in flesh prophet would say in moses under the blood of that goat that sheep walked out there took that stick reached towards the east thus saith the lord let there be flies never heard a fly walked on back it's already spoke it's a thought now it's spoke it's expressed it's the word of god then it come into human lips a simple man under the blood of a bull first thing you know a green fly began to fly around next thing you know there were five pounds per yard what was it was the word of god spoken through moses the creator because under the blood he was standing in the presence of god and his own words wasn't his word if ye abide in me and my words about and you then ask what you will it shall be given you where's the church standing at he says let there be frogs and there wasn't a frog in the country but in an hour's time they were ten foot deep in places what was it it was god the creator hiding himself in a simple man i want to ask you something if the blood of a bull or a goat be used for a bleach which can only cover could put a man in position to speak the creative word of god and bring flies into existence why would you stumble at the bleach of jesus christ's blood who could speak a squirrel or something into existence we read the bible under the blood of bulls and goats he's speaking flies he's speaking frogs he's speaking the the blood the nile turning the blood and we don't bat an eye but let a prophet speak about speaking a squirrel and news oh come on now or let a man talk about seeing a vision well come on now that was for the prophet you take away from the prophet when you do i say it takes away from the message of the hour if those things aren't in the message i say those are the very things that vindicate the message is true i say that if you don't have dreams and visions in the church then you're taken away from scripture in joel 2 28 the scripture said those things are going to be here so i say they got to be here if a man can stand there under the blood of bulls and goats and speak those things and torment satan what can you do under the shed blood of the lord jesus christ filled with the baptism of the holy ghost you can plague satan you can tear his kingdom down you can speak destruction upon this this evil hour that we live in you can do it that's what i want you to get today you can do it god had come down to deliver israel he came down to show judgment against israel but how did he do it boy you say that a lot brother i've been teaching sixth graders for 15 years i've repeated myself a lot it's what i do i repeat myself a lot he did it in flesh he did it through flesh how's he going to overcome every single demon in laodicea flesh every single one of them is going to be tormented by flesh exodus 7 1 the lord said unto moses see i have made thee a god to pharaoh then as a god i say it's time we do god things i say it's time we stand in our position and we put the word in action i say it's time that a third pool people start to do third pool things it's time that we operate and what he's called us to so we know the story and i'm gonna move quickly now how pharaoh began to make things more difficult on them after moses said let let israel go god has commanded you to let israel go and as we said it didn't happen instantly it didn't happen right there in that moment the exodus was a process but in so doing pharaoh began to make things more difficult right at the time of the exodus is when things got harder when there were more burdens and more unbelief trying to get the people to quit and he's pushing against some of you even today some of you even the last week in the last couple weeks things have come against you and it makes you wonder why i even keep pressing why even keep fighting why is he doing that because you're right at the moment of exodus you're right at the moment of freedom you're right at the moment of the rapture and he begins to push and he begins to push exodus six and nine and moses spake so unto the children of israel but they hearken not unto moses for anguish of spirit and for cruel bondage listen let me stop here for just a moment and tell you that the bondage of the enemy is cruel don't toy with it today don't play with it today if you're somebody that's sitting on the fence and you're not sure if it's true and you've never had that experience with almighty god you don't want to experience the cruelness of the bondage of the enemy as somebody who has experienced it and has the scars to prove it i'm telling you there's nothing out there that you want a part of there is nothing there but maybe some temporary joy for a fleeting moment and then days and days of depression and days and days of regret and worry and fear but i'm telling you if you ever one time we'll just taste and see that the lord is good if you'll ever just give him an opportunity to change your life you'll never be the same and you'll never want to be the same ever again the task masters of this world are very cruel upon being commanded to let my people go pharaoh replies who is the lord who is the lord i'ma read a bit here see egypt had many gods and so what pharaoh is saying when he says who is the lord is i have my own gods why should i listen to yours why should i obey your god who is he i i want to tell you that was a dumb question because he was about to find out he says who is he the egyptians like many pagan cultures worshiped a wide variety of nature gods and attributed to their powers the natural phenomenon they saw in the world around them there was the god of the sun of the river of childbirth of crops etc etc etc so when saying who is the lord that i should obey his voice pharaoh actually made a challenge is your god more powerful than my gods is your god more powerful than me the first plague turning the nile to blood was a judgment against apis the god of the nile isis the goddess of the nile and noon the guardian of the nile pharaoh is told by this you will know that i am the lord the second plague bringing frogs from the nile was a judgment against hakket the frog-headed goddess of birth frogs were thought to be sacred and never to be killed god had the frogs invade every part of the homes of the egyptians and when the frogs died their stinking bodies were heaped up in offensive piles all through the land the third plague gnats was a judgment on set the god of the desert the fourth plague flies was a judgment on uchitch the fly god and this the fly god the fifth plague the death of livestock was a judgment on the goddess of hathor and the god apis who were both depicted as cattle the six plague bulls was a judgment against several gods over health and disease the seventh plague hail attacked nut the sky goddess osiris the crop fertility god and set the storm god the eighth plague locust again focused on nut osiris and set the later crops wheat and rye which had survived the hell were now devoured by the swarms of locusts there would be no harvest in egypt that year the ninth plague darkness was aimed at the sun god ra who was symbolized by pharaoh himself and for three days the land of egypt was smothered in unearthly darkness but the homes of the israelites had light the tenth and last plague the death of the firstborn males was a judgment on all the egyptian gods including pharaoh himself what was this god taking the flesh of a man and making the gods of that evil age bow down before him and say we have no power over this god he's taken a people in this day and when depression comes when the gods of pornography and lust comes there's somebody that says i'm not gonna bow down to that and once again god raises up and says your gods will bow down at the feet of flesh once again of god and flesh who will stand and make the gods of laodicea bow down and will show they have no power over this god who is your god that i should obey him oh he is jehovah god he is the lord jesus christ he is the all-powerful and the gods of laodicea will bow down once again before him he has rendered them powerless in this day through a people the god of depression the god of anxiety the god of sickness the god that comes and says you have to look at all this naked flesh there is a people on the earth that says no i will not bow down i will be free i will rise above it we will be healthy we will have our children we will have our joy why do you keep saying those things are promises you are supposed to have those things don't let the gods of this age have one thing in your life he stood against those gods and showed that no demon power can stand before a a man in flesh when he takes the word of god upon his lips for the sake of time i'm going to skip ahead and try to bring this down that's where we're at right now the time has drawn now it's drawn now it's time we stop waiting this is how we fight our battles by taking the word of god upon our lips red sea part depression in the name of jesus leave sickness by his stripes i'm healed taking the word upon your lips jesus constantly tormenting the devil plaguing him in our opening scripture we read the account of legion from matthew and also from mark legion was a tormented soul a prisoner a slave tormented by demons demons a different type of slavery than what we've been dealing with with israel and maybe today you're not lost and out of your mind like legion was maybe it's a demon of depression or something like that that's changed itself to you maybe a sickness that has attached itself to you maybe it's a spirit of fear a spirit of doubt whatever it is it's a cruel taskmaster that's been plaguing you and tormenting you and we know that legion would dwell in the tombs and it said that nothing could tame him he was completely bound by satan but i want to encourage you to know that wherever you're at tonight my god hears the faintest hearts cry and maybe one night he'd come to himself just long enough to say god help me maybe that's all there was to it maybe it wasn't some altar call maybe it's just lord help me but it traveled down through miles and miles and miles to wherever jesus was and he hears the hearts cry lord help me lord i need you that was all it took and he crosses over a rage and see why it was time it was time for legion to be delivered why did he show up in elkton virginia here today because it's time it's time for you and for your deliverance and what you have need of and those demons had chained themselves to legion that's what they do they chain themselves but see that's a mistake when you're dealing with the with a child of god that's a mistake because you think for one minute those demons would have ran up into the presence of the lord jesus christ on purpose but the problem is they had chained themselves to legion they had changed themselves there they like to hide behind fear they like to hide behind worry they like to hold you back and exactly what do people think i'm telling you today if you got a need don't let them hold you back today don't let them hold you in your seat today don't let them hold you in that place of fear hiding behind well what about this and what about that don't be held back today those task masters that want you to believe that they have control of your life that you can't be healed that you can't have joy that you can't have deliverance they beat legion daily you're a failure you'll never be free you'll never be like the other people in the church you'll never be set free you'll never be loosed you'll never have your joy you'll never have your head and they beat him they tormented him they whipped him but things were about to change just like they had done in egypt things were about to turn why how it was time legion fought through all of that see in order to be delivered today you have to desire to be delivered you have to care enough to not care anymore i don't care what people think i don't care where i'm at i don't care how long i've been in this condition i care enough though to be free today i want to get to the feet of jesus i want to push through all that brother brown said he cared when the neurotic called legion cared enough under opposition to wiggle out from under those tombstones of the devils and go out to meet jesus and throw himself prostrate when legion all them devils would have never come if legion hadn't pushed his way out there to meet him and when he cared enough to make that effort that stand in his belief jesus cared enough to cast out the legion of devils from him and this neurotic condition was gone he cared when you care yes sir he cares when you care see those demons would have never come but they had no choice they had chained themselves to legion see the chains that bound legion were the very chains that would now drag those demons into the presence of god let me take a detour here for just a second and tell you there was a greek king in ancient times named mr mizentius i'm not greek pardon me he was known to be hateful and cruel he had no respect for life he was a great warrior on the battlefield he's remembered in history as the one who used what was known as the body of death torture as a form of punishment if you were captured in battle they would take a corpse a freshly killed corpse of one of your brothers and they would chain it to you face to face hand to hand foot to foot and you would be chained to it and you'd be sitting there to where that's all you could see the prisoner would struggle and try to shake free but after a while they felt like it was useless i'm chained to this thing i'll never be free from this when you moved it moved when you wiggled it wiggled and destroyed stared you in the face at all times you would begin to give in to the fact that you were stuck to this corpse face to face staring dead death right in the face it weighed you down it depressed you and that's exactly what the devil's done to some people with their depression he chains it to him with their anxiety he changed it to him with their failures he changed it to him and that's all you can see is the symptoms i try to move brother andrew but all i can see is the sickness i try to move but it's chained to me all i see is my failures all i see is my shortcomings all i see is death everywhere i'm not going to be able to get free of it it was agonizing you knew you needed to be free you hated being chained to it you could see it sucking the life out of you but what could you do you were stuck satan does that he changed that depression to you he changed condemnation to you he torments you he plagues you but there's a difference when it's to a child of god there's a difference when you change it to a child of god because when the tables turn when you become the tormentor when you become the plaguer now it's not that he's chained to you but now he's stuck he's got nowhere to go he's got nowhere to run oh how is it come here brother andrew that depression grabs a hold of you and it leads you around and it guides you everywhere you're going to go and you can't be free it's all you see and maybe you get up enough strength and you say today we're going to church i'm going to go i'm going to go and he's still there and you're bringing and you sit down and you battle and you fight and you're not getting much out of the service but the god's calling you and it's a struggle but slowly you begin to raise a hand you begin to worship you begin to enter in and he's still fighting you recognize jesus is there and you bring him you drag the devil i'll be free i'll be free i'll be free and you come to the feet of jesus oh he's stuck drag him into the presence of god fight through push through fight today drag him to the presence of god he's stuck hallelujah push through today drag that demon drag that enemy turn the tables it's time it's time to turn it on the enemy today glory hallelujah hallelujah you can stay standing you can stay with me for a second i'm dumb i got to drive something home he begs god he begs jesus don't torment him don't do it he says why are you doing it before the time they knew there was a time coming they knew there was a time coming where man and flesh was supposed to torment him they said why are you doing this now before the time why are you plaguing me in other words why now what did they mean what did they mean those task masters had been tormented by man taking god upon his lips before the excess where the tables had been turned and the tormentor became the tormentor became the tormented why torment us before the time those demons spoke of this time they knew there was a time coming they knew there was an hour of torment coming they knew there was a time that they would be
