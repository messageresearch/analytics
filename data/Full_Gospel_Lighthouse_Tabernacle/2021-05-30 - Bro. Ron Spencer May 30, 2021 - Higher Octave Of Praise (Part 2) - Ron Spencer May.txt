wonderful [Music] he is wonderful he's so good to me and he's coming soon [Music] he's coming soon oh he's coming soon he so good to me [Applause] do believe that i am testifying about what god has done for wesley um he's 15 months old and up until this time he hasn't walked crawl and hardly even stood on his own two feet around seven months i started taking him to uh the chiropractor and he was checked out and everything and everything was fine he just had some tension in his neck and something to do with his hips but i mean it didn't really cause concern um but we took him for about three months or so and every month that would come and go and there was no sign of standing crawling anything any desire to do that was starting to become really alarming to me and i cannot tell you how many prayers i prayed over this boy um i'd go out in the woods to have some alone time with the lord and i would just really cry out to god about him and his birthday comes and goes and i'm really starting to feel a little down in my heart and i brother wayne lawson was here and i had him get prayed over and he started making improvements and we had this little walker in our home called and around we go and i would normally put him in this around we go and he would just sit there i would give him so much tummy time all these months and he would just lay there i would listen to random tapes and it would it would just so happen to be that on these random tapes um brother brandon would talk about that mother that would take her baby to the ten cent thrift store and she would wave everything in front of that baby and that baby would just sit there and stare and she pretty much collapses in the store and she's like oh god this baby's not any better even though you'd wave a toy in front of wesley he's going to acknowledge it he's going to reach out for it but still that desire that lack of desire for not wanting to be mobile was starting to really weigh heavy on me and i would listen to him talk talk tell that story and i would be like i'm starting to relate to that panic and but like i said i prayed so many prayers and god is my god and he heard every single one of them and two sundays ago when brother ron had that vision of him walking wesley down the aisle and he told him i'm going to heal that baby i don't really know what was wrong with them but even that desire that lack of desire for not wanting to be mobile he needed to be healed from that but the last two weeks god has been at our house he has been going around and around in that around we go just as fast as he can go he's been trying to crawl he's been trying to pull himself up on our coffee table he'll stand on his own two feet and he's even trying to take a few steps when you're holding on to his hand we also have a little bus that he loves and normally we would have to push him on this bus he can also walk behind the bus when the time comes he loves it and i had him sitting on this bus just a few days ago and i wasn't even thinking about anything i didn't even think he knew what to do with this bus as soon as i put him on that bus he starts taking off with his legs and i will say that every single time wesley does something that he's never done before i can feel the presence of the lord come in the room that day when he got on that bus he came in the living room it was very it was a very sweet but strong feeling and every time something like that happens i think of that song i don't even know what it's called that song how can i keep from shouting your name how could i ever say enough how amazing is your love so god is good and he's going to either crawl or walk or something but he'll be just fine hallelujah hallelujah well give god praise you just watched a miracle you heard a mother's heart but oh the heart of the father is so much greater oh praise the lord brother ron told her that when he takes off in church you let him run and when he runs through here i want everybody else running right through right behind him it's going to happen he said and i believe it jesus has come by the way more than the corridors this morning he's come by the way a full gospel lighthouse to do business he's come to heal your heart he's come to minister to you i was speaking with ali last weekend before we come to church on sunday and she's been having some real allergy issues and her eyes really bothering her and so i just grabbed her up into my arms there before we come to church and i told her i said now allie today jesus is going to come by when he comes by i want you to just i just want you to talk to him he might sweep by you in a breeze he might i don't know how he'll do it but when he comes by i want you to i want you to just talk to him there and ask him lord will you will you touch my eyes she come to me after church she said daddy jesus came by my way she said i can't hardly cry she said but i she said i began to cry right there and she said i can't hardly talk to you without crying about it if a little child could recognize the presence of the lord what about us today i believe jesus is coming by our way and i believe it's more than time to just step into the water i believe he is the water of life and i believe it's time to receive him receive healing receive salvation receive more of the holy ghost it's time to praise him like never before it's time to adore him and worship him it's a time of worship it's a time of priests oh shouldn't we praise him maybe we sing that song this morning i i never lost my praise before we turned it over to brother ron this morning i lost some good friends a long last way some love once deep heartedly in heaven to stay but thank god i didn't lose everything i've lost faith in people who said they cared in the time of my crisis they would never there but in my disappointment in my season one thing never wavered one thing never changed that i never lost my hope oh hallelujah oh and i never lost my joy oh and i never lost my faith but most of all i never lost my brains well i've let some blessings let them sleep away when i lost my focus and astray but thank god i didn't lose everything [Music] i lost possessions that were so dear and i lost some battles by walking in fear but in the midst of my struggle in my season of pain one thing never wavered one thing never changed that i never lost my hope praise the lord oh and i never lost my joy oh and i never lost my faith but most of all i never lost my praise i never lost my hope and i never lost my hope oh praise the lord oh and i never lost my joy [Music] [Music] i've never lost my praise i never lost my hope for i've never lost my hope can you say man this morning oh and i never lost my joy and i never lost my faith but most of all i never lost my brains hallelujah we've been through a few things but we never lost our praise hallelujah amen good to be in the house of the lord this morning good to have him in the house this morning amen good to have him in the house and so amen i just love the lord with all of our hearts and i sent andrew a note yesterday maybe maybe even brother tim pruitt i said it's good to be studying in a room with your hair standing on your head you know he's in the room well it's good to be in the room to preach what he told you to preach and to feel the hair standing on your head

and come and sweep everything out of your home i'm thankful for america america she may be rotten but i'm thankful that she's still as good as you can get so we we're thankful for that we stand with her in her glory and we stand with her in her shame and we are we're i'm proud to be an american i'm thankful for this is where i live and i i don't have anything against any other country but i'm glad that god chose my dirt to come from here amen and i've been a lot of places in the world and and saw a lot of beautiful things and i have a lot of incredible friends all over the world but i'm always thankful to come home amen and so i'm sure everybody feels the same way when we stand and raise our hand to the flag which we we fly wherever you're at you'd be proud of that but we are citizens of another kingdom and that kingdom is much higher than this and we have a prince of peace that's going to bring peace to the whole world and so we're going to be a part of all of that and so

feeling the pressure i know the enemy is trying his hardest to take you out but it's only because you're on the brink of a life-changing miracle hold on a little longer child of god you're about to see god's supernatural power like never before amen amen and amen amen god bless you nobody wants to see that miracle any more than i do brother ray so we're believing for it amen the day i don't have to take chemo anymore i'm going to shout amen god bless you brother joe was awesome last night amen that was just awesome hallelujah hallelujah i know you enjoyed that if you will turn with me to psalms chapter 46 and verse 1. i want to continue to look at the higher octave of praise this morning amen psalms chapter 46 and verse 1. amen it was while he was in the room that he took me to this scripture so i'd say he's in the room now god is our refuge and strength boy we got to be able to shout right there a very present help in the time of trouble and we say hallelujah therefore will not we fear though the earth be removed and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea though the waters thereof roar and be troubled though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof there is a river the streams whereof shall make glad the city of god the holy place of the tabernacles of the most high god is in the midst of her she shall not be moved god shall help her and that right early the heathen raged the kingdoms were moved he uttered his voice and the earth melted the the lord of hosts is with us the god of jacob is our refuge salah come before the works of the lord what desolations he hath made in the earth he maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth he breaketh the bow and cutteth the spear in sunder he burneth the chariot in the fire be still and know that i am god i will be exalted among the heathen i will be exalted in the earth the lord of hosts is with us the god of jacob is our refuge and for that we say hallelujah glory to god let's pray this morning and you have a need won't you just lift it to the lord he's in the room amen almighty god we bow our heads before you this this morning you're the giver of life you're the author and the finisher of our faith so the god that started the miracle will finish the miracle the god that started the process of time will hold us into eternities lord god lord even in our temporary situations don't let our temporary problems dominate our lives may we lift our hands and give glory to the almighty god that is greater than every problem he's greater than every situation he's greater than every kingdom on this earth kingdoms of finances kingdoms of governments kingdoms of taxation kingdoms around the world kingdoms of sports he's greater than all of those kingdoms father we represent that kingdom of yours on the earth today father you're among us we don't have to beg you to be here you're here and we give ourselves holy to you yield ourselves as servants to obey your word today bless now heal every sick save every lost fill every person with the spirit of god like never before we are hungry and we want to be fed oh god feed us of the wine of the holy ghost now minister to our hearts even now in jesus christ's name we pray a man and a man amen and you may be seated let's have church look over at your neighbor and say let's have church he's been fighting you all week long the devil has and why don't you just tell him today time out devil we're going to have church here [Applause] oh hallelujah now let's remember just just as a reminder who we are maybe the first time maybe hearing a sermon but maybe we must remember god's choosing abroad when brother branham came to choosing of a bride he preached sermons like god's chosen place of worship god's very choosing where he likes to go to be worshipped at then brother branham comes to a point there's about 700 people that was there that was listening to the sermon in a live audience of of choosing of a bride and if you remember the morning he spoke on the shock won't be air with the wheat now that's what brother brahm called it that evening and of course they they they named it a little bit different when it when it was actually put in book form but he says he said that shock won't be won't be air with the wheat that's a real true statement that's a real true statement the shock's gonna fall away and the wheat's going to take a rapture [Music] now god's made a choice of his wife and we have been predetermined to live in this age and we're pre-planned and we're predestinated we will overcome and so god has brought us into a special position as the bride of jesus christ we are reflecting in genesis 24 of of rebecca saying i will go with the man brother man said she acted on an impulse angel had arranged in the meeting and she was the predestinated bride eloheeser didn't realize that he was going to be a type as a well as the elder servant that god would sin in this generation listen there's not another message coming the rapture is imminent at any time the bride around the world in every nation has made herself ready we have been given the wedding garment we type like elegieser we type the bride that listened to elohees's voice now we didn't fall in love with elohees or brother branham but we fell in love with christ himself the word living in this day now we must remember that that elohees are told what isaac was like eleganzer told him what he likes and how he acts and what his attitude was and and and there was a song that was sung elijah tell me more so in this day you've got tapes that you listen to listen to like chosen chosen place of worship or or god identified in his characteristics or or jezebel religion you want to know how to dress to be the bride of jesus christ now the denomination they don't want that they can't chew that they really can't chew that because they've got a closet that they'd like to go to look like jezebel act like jezebel gonna preach this morning but i want you to know god's coming for a bride that reflects his character [Applause] and you say well brother ron but i can't measure up to that but the christ inside of you if you'll invite him he'll come and change your life i've had sisters tell me say well you know i i i don't agree with certain things about this and i just said just keep listening to the messenger just keep listening to the messenger he's telling you how to dress how to act how to be a ladyluck come on church come on church we're not the first pentecostal bride of are you with me now we're we're not we're not we're not air with that shock we're not there with the shock and and what the response to your life actually tells you where you're headed [Music] are you with me we're real christians now this this message is available to listen to and god made it so that you can listen to it and you say well brother ron where should i start well i you know i'm a little bit dyslexic so sometimes uh i just start at the end and i just go to communion or i go to leadership and i just start listening now you you say well what do i do you know i hear all these things push play but there's more than just push and play then you come to church [Music] [Applause] you know here at church if you have noticed and been here for a while you notice that we have don't have any pacifiers here and we don't have a adult diapers here [Applause] we don't have a lot of drama here in this church i'm not a drama guy i don't like drama my home is not drama i don't fuss fight fume do all those different kind of things that cause drama because i believe god wants to live in this church we don't have boards and we don't vote and we don't do all of those kind of things that create politics in the church we don't do drama here [Applause] you have drama like that and your church is hey we got some empty pews come on we want to live right here we want to do right here are you with me now what am i doing with that listen this church is built just as much it is a house of praise because we are the bride it gives us something to praise the lord about we are his wife [Applause] we are not a mannequin if you don't know what that word is sometimes when you go through some of these some of these uh department stores there'll be a mannequin stand in there and i have certain clothes on it and they'll be god's not coming back for a mannequin he's not coming back for your computer your ipod your telephone he's not coming back for your pictures on the wall he's coming back for sons and daughters of god that are living

probably the wrong church well brother ron i want you to fix my problems i i i want you i i would like to have about four hours with you to just tell you my life story save your breath i don't do life stories you do the prayer [Music] it brings me to a good spot sometimes we expect god to answer prayer that we haven't prayed sure god can read your mind but that's not what he said for you to do you pray and believe prayer is uttering words across your lips sometimes quietly sometimes boisterous but god hears prayer now understand being the bride of jesus christ you have power to bind and loose sometimes the devil runs all over your lives because you haven't took the time to find him how do i find him take the word of god and go to prayer and tell the devils get out of my life and go back to hell where you came [Applause] from that might not be politically correct or even religiously correct but that's one spot in your life where you can tell somebody to go to hell don't take that wrong don't tell your boss or your wife you tell the devil when you pray believe faith believe it so many times we suffer and we neglect because of unoffered prayers well that's good amen let me just say this to you before we go into this subject this morning you don't have to go to the president of the united states of america you don't have to go to the to the emperor or over top of russia or even the pope you as a christian can fall on your knees and cause hell to shake when you utter prayer before our living god and i want to remind you before we go forward he is the greatest king that there is he is the king of kings and he is the lord of lords and there's no power more powerful than our god now god more powerful than our god i feel him psalms chapter 47 now we move into our sermon

first earth were passed away and there was no more sea and i john saw the holy city new jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband that's me and i heard a great voice out of saying behold the tabernacle of god is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and god himself shall be be with them and be their god for god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor cry neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away that's enough to shout about tonight and he that set up on the throne said behold i make all things new and he said unto me right for these words are are true and faithful and he said unto me it is done i am alpha and omega the beginning to the end and i will give unto him that is a thirst the fountain of water freely and he that over cometh shall inherit all things hallelujah it all belongs to us i don't care what satan whispers in your ear it's all ours and i will be his god and he shall be my son revelations 19 and verse 6 and i beheld as if it were a voice of a great multitude as the voice of many waters and the uh as a voice

come and his wife hath made herself ready that's what's going on here and the dress fits perfectly this message fits perfectly on us hallelujah god didn't trim the the message to fit us he trimmed us to fit the message [Music] and her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine line and clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the saints and he saith unto me right blessed are they which are called to the marriage supper of the lamb and he sayeth unto me these are the true saiyans of god it's not words of a man this is not a prediction in your weather channel this is the

eye habitation i'm gonna be in a place brother john where i can praise him i'm gonna live there i'm gonna walk there i'm gonna preach there i'm gonna overcome them i don't care what comes my way in my life i've had some troubles but i have found if i can dwell in an atmosphere of worship and praise that you can come overcome anything in your life i find people that are negative all the time is that's what they rather now it's because their fountain is contaminated you think negative you get negativity all through your body you just start praising the lord in the midst of your trial you just start praising the lord when that gloomy spirit comes around you just start praising the lord use the supernatural power of your body your tongue [Music] just for exercise spit on it clean it up

supernatural thing about your body turn the camera that way i want you to it has the power of life and death in it [Music] it has the power of life and death in that tongue and it operates from your heart and if you talk to a guy long enough you can find out he's backslid or he's overcoming because praise will be on his lips and he's not negative all the time come on church pointing this way and pointing that way and blaming this and blaming that god has something to say about somebody else in the church just look in the mirror you're your only biggest problem i know this is going a lot of places your problem is not your teachers it's not your principle it's not your neighbor it's not the pastor the biggest problem that every one of you got is yourself [Applause] god's unlimited is you that limited god there shall no evil befall thee neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways so angels of god are stretched all across this building tonight by the thousands they're standing everywhere they have watched over you to get you here they protect you you are the best protected people then more than the

trouble i will deliver him and honor him with long life will i satisfy him and show him my salvation today the scientific theory of the modern so-called religionist groups have tried to prove that this thing that we have called the holy spirit is only emotion see it just don't stand up to according to their scientific theory well i would like to ask him this what makes them change what makes a drunkard stop drinking what makes a prostitute cease from her evil life what makes cancer and diseases depart from people and the deaf and the dumb and the blind and the dead to raise up explain that is that emotion it has a motion with it certainly anything that's alive has emotion and anything that doesn't have emotion is dead [Music] [Applause] brother i'm going to send you a text and blast you for being emotional you're telling me that you're dead and anything that's dead needs to be buried and if you want to be buried go to the funeral home and get an early you can walk in and get a discount you can pick out your casket you can pick up the stone that they'll put on it you can pick out what it was this just saying there's a lot of people said in church that should go to the funeral home because they're dead they want the preacher to praise god for they want the songlander to praise god for them they said they crossed their arms and said entertain me we are not entertainers i am not in the entertaining business this is where we come and worship god if you don't feel comfortable here leave all right we need your pew but i think we ought to bury some of these emotionless religions for those on by the way of the internet that now criticizing me that is brother branham's words in black with yellow marking on it you'll profit that you believe and i want to remind you that i have been around for quite a long time i got gray hair in my head and i stood at his casket as a little boy and i remember when brother branham they would tell a brother random when he would get done preaching he'd start swinging his coat over top of his head going walking the altar [Applause] brother branham was not a dead preacher he was quite emotional the devil's passing out so let me give him a little bit more there was a time that brother branham got to preaching so hard he jumped up on the plaque on the pulpit and got the shake in his legs and then he got down into the pulpit and he started pulling his pants up come on he didn't just limit it to church i hear him talking about up on a hunting trip then he got to shouting and he got to shouting around the tree i ain't no schoolboy when it comes to this message i've been eating it since i was a little boy i've been digesting it and i have always believed that this message will one day live in a church and i've lived long enough to see it happen you're full of this movement life of his life all of his power spirit of his spirit your christ in the pride of jesus christ why shouldn't we get inside why should we praise him the other day when i saw those jews being bombed yet there were thousands of them standing at the wailing wall worshiping and if you were able to get the video i don't have it available to send to you but they were standing there dancing while bombs were dropping if god's formed who can be against them [Applause] america i want to give you a warning you turn your back on israel bonds

cancer if you hang around here long enough you hang around here long enough you're gonna wake up one morning and come to find my body and i ain't gonna be here and he's going to go back and report to his cohorts that old guy with gray hair and round glasses he's redhead it ain't even it's the same house but it ain't the same people living there but i ain't gonna be here long 30 to 40 days

valley the mind and the morning star oh how we love you how we adore you how we praise you thou maxless eternal one we give thee praise we'll praise thee and give thee praise to all the ages receive

how we praise him how we adore him forever and ever o receive the very adorations of our heart express our lips lord from the depths of our pure heart we praise thee knowing that it's not what we could do it's not our life it's his life it's not our salvation it's his salvation it's not our heaven it's his heaven it's not our own works it's his works not our grace it's his grace not our glory but his glory god our power but his power how we love you not our church but his church how we praise thee for that's our hearts lord that's making my lips stick together it works gently but that's making my lips stick together a few more minutes for me five dollars followers five ten fifteen twenty hallelujah it good say can you stick around here much longer keep fighting me i'm gonna whoop you and then i'm just gonna whip you brother lyle and i as as we were set out there he said that that's sister moore's father and how he told me that in the early days back in those days when they were persecuted and turned out from everywhere that that he was in a meeting wants to to where that they were that had forbid them to worship the lord in the spirit the devil's been around in a long time he knows that if real children of god start worshiping he got trouble he got trouble and he said and a group of people come up there and shop through the windows with pistols and rifles and an old sister standing in the floor with hands up in the air praising god while the windows were being riddled with bullets from rifles and the bullets struck the woman's dress and fell to the floor without harming her we need to go back to a power of god and something that can do the same thing today although in our numbers persecution always gives strength to the church we've had it so easy we get slothful we get to the place where we don't want to move on because everything's just handed to us it takes sorrow tears sweat prayer faith then a promise to move forward in the power of the holy ghost that zeal and power that they had in those days as long as time vanished from our attend our our assemblies i'm afraid if the winners would get shot out tonight people would run every way and never come back hallelujah i haven't even got to the good part yet a true picture of the modern church today neither does the modern church want any of these you're screaming shouting tongues speaking acts 238 youngins around her she don't want any of them whooping and crying and screaming why such a child would immediately be put out of her denomination if they had one like that in their churches they'd throw her out real quick why are you letting such a stuff as that go on you see she's pregnant with something cause she's going to bring fourth members all the time but she don't want any of them none of them scream and hollering blabbering acts 2 38 miserable creatures that she thinks that they are it would certainly embarrass her it would ruin her her and her educated ethical scientific society church that she belonged to here they would throw her out at the next council she can't have it so she don't want to be pregnant with the word because that's the only kind that the word can bring forth [Applause] born of the spirit of god that's the spirit of god in it no intellectual church joining creed joy going black hair painted face there's no such a thing as that in it you don't find that in the word of god you find old-fashioned sanctified holy ghost-filled child born of the spirit of god screaming hollering shouting praising god seems like the older i get the rowdier i get now you waste your time praying for me to die because the next one's routier than i am god's already voted you ain't gonna have to vote he's already put him in place you ain't got to worry this church don't have to be nervous it's already been taken care of [Applause] hallelujah we might as well drive some nails in some coffins here let's go ahead and make the devil nervous for the next give me 10
