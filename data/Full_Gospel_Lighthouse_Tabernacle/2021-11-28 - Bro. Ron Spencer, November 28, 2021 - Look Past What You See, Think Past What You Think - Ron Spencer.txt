amen amen so love you with all of our hearts today's a special day we have many baptisms this afternoon or today and i'll do my best to kind of deliver the word and what's on my heart and we're looking forward to what god is doing in in his and his and his doing amen today is an anniversary for me today is the day two years ago that brother kelly hildebrant came and handed me this coin and satan had tried to stop the visitation and him coming and two years ago and it's a commemorative coin with a piece of grain of sand on it of d-day we didn't realize what a war that we was going to go through and on the back of it says we will accept nothing less than full victory [Music] amen amen you know that's what we're doing too amen when the doctors tell you they don't have another patient doing what you're doing it's kind of a nice it's kind of a nice thing so amen appreciate your prayers for us for doing this two years and uh but we're still moving we're still going forward and so amen today i just have something on my heart that's very close to my heart i had a visitation with the lord sometime back and these words were spoken to me see past what you see think past what you think i haven't actually spoke a sermon from that and the lord just just gave me some some some insight to some things and so i would just i would just ask you that you would just help me today as we look to the word and we realize that faith looks past what we naturally see with our eyes because everything you see with your eyes is temporal i want to say this just real quickly to you i don't care what problem you're in today every situation that you're in that is causing you so much grief and turmoil and woe and anxiety and blood pressure issues and all kinds of ups and downs in your life it's just stuff it's just stuff and i want to remind you and this is really hard for all of us to do is look past what you see look past what you see my father is slipping into a dementia state and and as he's as he's making some slips there's days or moments to where he's very clear there's days that he's not clear you got to look past what you see this is just a very temporary realm just a couple of weeks ago we were standing here with brother harold at the at the podium and praying with him knowing a storm was coming but god knows that we see past what we see even in a hospital bed if we could just see where he's at today i want to share a quote with you before we go to hebrews chapter 11 and verse 1. this present this present earth in its condition at its best the cl is the closest the redeemed will ever come to hell that's quite a statement if this is as close as i'll ever come to hell that's quite a spot but for the sinner i want you to really grab this but for the sinner it is the closest they will ever come to heaven amen our stay here on this earth is in its fallen condition is only a place of preparation getting us ready to go to a place where we really live hallelujah god help us today amen hebrews chapter 11 and verse 1. now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen i want you to read that with me now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen now this is an action scripture for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous god testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh if you think on that's quite a that's quite a statement though he's not in this realm that we can see his life still speaks by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because god had translated to him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased god by faith it is impossible but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him by faith noah being warned of god of things that are not seen as yet moved with fear prepared an ark to the saving of his house by which he condemned the world the saving of his house condemned the world that and became an heir of the righteous which is by faith by faith abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing where he went by faith he sojourned in a land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in tabernacles with isaac and jacob and the heirs with him in the same promise for he looked for a city that hath foundations whose builder and makeup is god in revelations chapter 3 and verse 16 now he's talking to our age laodicea so you can if you can just capture my theme just for a moment see past what you see and he said so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot i will spew thee out of thy mouth because thou sayest i am rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing we live in an age to where the church thinks they don't need god amen we live in an age where people think i don't have any need of god we've got governments that don't have any need of god the constitution is nothing anymore the bible the ten commandments is nothing anymore they don't want god and know us not that thou art wretched miserable and poor and blind and naked and let me just say this to you there's another place that's going to be naked hell everybody's naked in hell i counseled thee to buy me gold tried in the fire that they all must be rich and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear because heaven is not a naked place and anoint thine eyes with isaf that thou mayest see jesus would make this statement and it'd be very good blessed are your eyes for you see and i want to say this to this audience blessed are your eyes for they say he bypassed a million to pick you he opened your eyes and blinded everybody else quite a statement quite a start amen quite a start so sitting in this building is quite a nice place to be amen let's pray lord jesus we feel your presence even now we ask you that you would anoint this audience lord and this group of people may you speak to us in a very supernatural way lord as i as a speaker i ask have asked all morning to get myself out of the way to step beyond the mortal realm of troubles mortality of of different things that's attacking my body even today and i ask you that i can step beyond all of that and step into your realm minister to these people we pray in jesus name amen and amen you may be seated brother andrew finished last night with the guards to the book of life matthew mark and luke and john they have a responsibility to if you can just take these words blessed are your eyes that you see this book is an open book to the believer the bible is the most powerful book that there is within a sentence it can literally change your life uh in many different directions almost every day you can find us literally a scripture in the bible that speaks volumes lay in there for all your life and then all of a sudden that scripture will be speak volumes to you in your life matthew mark and luke and john are the four disciples that are going to that are going to be the guards to the book of life now they're anointed as brother andrew was saying last night they're anointed from the throne of god they will not only they'll do twofold purpose they will guard the book of life which is the book of acts which is the holy ghost or the life of jesus christ living on the inside of the believer book is more than a historical reference book but it's an action book being a christian is more than quoting psalms or quoting scriptures or dressing a certain way there's a lot of people dressed certain ways i was i was standing in in geneva in switzerland and i as i watched the jews walk past and i i watched it was a they had a they had a great conference there and the jewish old order and i don't want to say anything uh irreverent here but they were dressed in their curls and they were dressed in their their their jewish attire and their long robes and all of this and they were going and and it was just hundreds of them that was going in this direction and they were just walking they were just making their way they had they you know there was i don't know how many thousand people was in but they had the attention of the airport and i thought to myself you missed jesus you've got your long robes and you've got all of this but you miss jesus and i stood there and i i i had a great awe from one realm i i looked and i saw this religious order as it walked past no doubt they may be the same people that will kill the two prophets that come back and tell them about who jesus was this is more than a book it has the very breath of life and as matthew is standing there and he writes go ye into all the world to teach and preach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost and he writes it in such a way i like how the prophet tells us he said he wrote it in such a way that it blinded the whole world being a guard to acts 2 and verse 38. that we're going to baptize today being a guard he kept the whole religious world from seeing the deity of jesus christ because if you ever truly see the deity of jesus christ you'll see yourself [Music] and there you are and you can't help but see it so he makes sure that you see it but he makes sure the world don't see it hope you don't mind i'm going to take my time just for a bit do you see that guard with your natural eye no way you can see it but with your spiritual eye no way you can miss it you see we become guardians of the revelation there's some things that just too sacred hardy to even say i want to just share a few quotes with you just to kind of give you where i want to be at brother brown says look at the indifference of people today look how unconcerned that they are they're eating they're drinking they're given in marriage just as it was predicted they have a form of godliness but they deny the power thereof the bible says from from such turn away very religious they're always been very religious but not having the spiritual insight to understanding that's the main thing that's the thing that designates your eternal destination is spiritual conception now watch this watch what he does with this what if pharaoh would have known that the emancipator of egypt he was sending him out into a desert and chasing him it would have been different but he didn't have spiritual understanding that the moses had nor could he understand the attitude that moses had taken for why would this man with the world at his hands would reject it and walk out into a desert with a bunch of disobedient people why he was considered a fanatic a quack tens of thousands no doubt laughing at him but his conviction of his spiritual insight that by faith he saw the god of promise there was moses looking out the same window as pharaoh but seeing two complete different worlds and when jesus stood on the earth he was the greatest witness that god ever had for there was the fullness of god in him and when he began to do the works of god they began to call him beelzebub the devil judging the spirit of god that was in him saying it was the devil that was performing the miracles quite a difference in it i shared this just a few moments ago when jesus was here the world was in chaos governments were in chaos and here was the redeemer of all of the earth the greatest man that would ever live and jerusalem was upside down roman government was over them listen politics was at its worst and they were turning down this heretic and screaming the very people that only a week before was screaming hosanna to the king under the power of politics of the church begin to scream crucify him under the backdrop of a world in chaos jesus gave his life when the seals were revealed in 1963 and god was open in the bible to the world and he was opening up who the great harlot was baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ he was opening up his redemptions plan who is worthy who is the bride and i could go on and and he was he was going to unfold the mysteries of himself and actually yourself and in the the backdrop of that john f kennedy has been assassinated the world is in chaos the vietnam war and all of the turmoil and the people in the streets malcolm x is is preaching his nonsense martin luther king is on his way men are being washed with vi with literally fire hoses elvis presley is on the scene he is shaking the world with rock and roll all of the guys that were with him the beatles come on the scene they're coming from europe and they're singing songs inspired right out of the river of euphrates right out of hell are you with me now the world was picking on its drug scene hollywood was at its pits and at the very same time the word was being revealed to the bride of jesus christ listen this word is not to the world it's not to the world it's to a select group of people it blinds their eyes and it opens your eyes the bride's revival is going on the world knows nothing about it the character of jesus christ is displayed in a people it's not something you put on something that you manufacture it's not coming from the personality of a man are you with me it's across the world everywhere god has a people on the scene we've got scoffers we've got make believers we've got we've got a lot of different different facets and the world is again in chaos i don't know about you but i dread listening to the news and if i stop for a moment it would cause me to be a bit nervous and maniac to think about what's happened to our godly nation [Music] are you with me many scream in the charismatic world there's going to come a revival they missed the revival they missed their visitation you sow to the wind you reap a whirlwind men think that they have the answer there's only one that has an answer and that's jesus the prophet says when i'm when a man once catches the vision of an invincible god invisible god and know that he's always presence there's something that stabilizes that man's thinking it stabilizes his actions in the time of distress and trouble it'll still make him look upward beyond above the things that are happening around him let me just say this to you you got to raise your head above everything that's around you the challenge of this day it's not acting like a world or becoming one of the world it's raising your head me just say raising your head above your normal problems that you have around you raise your head above it [Applause] for two years you've watched the journey take place you've watched the journey take place your pastor your watched him go through one of the death cycles watched cancer in the brain cancer in the in the in the lungs cancer in the lymph nodes her doctor's reports but if there's any example that i can give you you got to raise your head above [Music] it you with me and it's very difficult when you're the man in the arena [Music] you've heard sermons like the man in the arena you've heard champion you've heard those things that were inspired from very dark hours and it was in a very dark hour that the lord came to me in in my bedroom and i saw a man standing there and i stepped up out of the bed and he just took me like a father would to a son and he just turned hands on my shoulders kind of across my back and and i just watched the vision happen and let me just this is going to be the first time i've shared this but in that vision i i saw i saw a city look like a total chaos total destruction i'll mention some names here i hope that's all right i saw this team of men that sat here with us at work i saw thomas my brother-in-law i saw harold my other brother-in-law each one having construction helmets on and we were working and it seemed like it it seemed like the more we worked the more we destroyed and i just i just looked at it and i thought what a chaos why is he showing me this and the words were whispered see past what you see and then the vision changed it became the most beautiful city amen i've ever seen in my life i'm not expecting you to believe that or even jump into it and say i'm working on something that looks chaotic but it's actually eternal but i was there i want to i want to just take you just for a moment i just shared a supernatural experience very supernatural that's meant much how a vision works it was a meeting in oslo brother branham is that brother brandon was standing on a very tall stage and there was a little girl that they were trying to get in the prayer line and she was just a wee little thing and they picked that little girl up and just put her right in front of brother branham no other way would they have got her there and they put her right in front of brother branham and he's i'm just going to put a couple things together brother branham was afraid that she would fall off of that tall stage so he reached to grab her and the the interpreter begins to talk to her and she was mumbling off something she said i want to meet the man that's going to pray for me she the little little girl was blind and the interpreter said that's him that's got a hold of you and she moved the little hands by the way and you hear brother branham say it another place he said she wrapped her hands around her his hands one because it looked like she was going to fall off the stage but another and she moved her little hands by the way and i i had this very same suit on that was given to me about six years ago in oslo he said and she put her little arms around me like that and laid her head over on my shoulder and i thought she's like my little girl becky and i stroked her little long plaits like that and i thought poor little thing i heard her snubbing like a child on my bosom and i raised her head up and her eyes were white looking at her little face as she leaned back like that on my arm and thereby the grace of god i saw a vision come forth this little girl i seen her laying in her mother's arms watch now this is and takes him somewhere i seen her laying in her mother's arm and the doctor looking at her and she was blind from birth tall thin mother with blonde hair i see her father a short heavyset man with dark hair where they were and the speaking of the vision and the mother was sitting in the audience and the father back there under many thousands and thousands and thousands of people sitting back there and when i looked i said now of course i have no power what is it it was an atmosphere it was shekinah was the one that was giving this thing and i looked and i saw that little girl was going like a shadow out of this little girl was going walking along with her hands up looking around looking toward and pointing at things and i knew that god of heaven lived and reigned and i pulled her over and i prayed for her raised her up and she was looking at me her little eye scaring and sparkling she mumbled off something the translator looked down and said brother branham she can see and i said keep it to yourself just a minute what's she saying she's asking what are those things up there it was lights and when the translator heard and and she was close enough to her mother and heard her the voice and the rest of them and she looked up and she began weeping out loud and her mother was so excited the influence had took over the whole building there set thousands and thousands of people under a room and this little girl they saved her from stumbling and they placed her in the right spot god knows how to put you in the right spot that whole building was under that heavenly influence i want you to listen to what the prophet said he said the devil was paralyzed i pray this morning that every critic every spirit of unbelief would be paralyzed [Applause] you like that quote now let's go to another place he said you're attending this revival god has done everything in the book for you he's proven it as long as you live people's received the holy ghost they've been filled with god's spirit young and old they have repented of their sins they got joy in their heart we've seen divine healing take place people with heart trouble different disease is healed we've seen the angel of god come down and go through the building just like just like he said just before the coming of the lord would be the discerning of spirits and things prophetic utterances went forth people spoke in tongues they prophesied and vindicated the word back and forth you've seen it and set now watch what he does with that he reminds them of what god's happened happened in that meeting and i want to remind you today what we've seen not just in this service but the decades we've seen it we've seen the dead raised we've seen cancers delivered we've seen heart situations taken care of we've seen marriages be fixed we we we have seen the worst drug addicts be turned to real gentlemen we've seen women that were of of a different nature i'll just put it like that become ladies of grace we've seen children rise and become pillars not just of a community but pillars of the church brother brown amasses that audience he said which choose which you choose tonight hollywood or heaven you're going to be asked to give a reason someday what then that quote kept coming back to me this week as it kept coming back to me i thought god you must you must have something on your your mind if this keeps resonating and coming back to me and then he dropped this in my heart this morning you're sitting here and there's people in another realm would give it all for one service the rich young ruler would give it all amen marilyn monroe would give it all presidents of this nation would give it all to sit in your seat so i want to ask you is this just another service the people that stood outside of the ark and made fun as they listened to that preacher for 120 years they'd give it all to be in that ark i want to say this and i want to say it prophetically and i want it to be a sounding board right here this morning there's people that are sitting here this morning that would give it all if they would have only woke up in this service and their eyes come open and say that's the truth you say you're just pointing that out because i'm sitting here i got news for you he gave me that before you ever even got in this building so he's telling you escape this world [Applause] i'm a religious person brother ron that's that religion hold you is it molding the character of christ in you is it keeping you virgin [Music] or do you struggle with trying to stay away from the world come on you know that you don't have to have to answer you know it i want to say this statement to you if you're comfortable with this world if you're comfortable with this world something's really wrong in your soul absolutely a young man here i think he's 14 years old is that correct 14 15. i'm sorry that's a 16 16. gray-headed i'm grey-headed i don't hear well sometimes it's a great thing but these people have traveled eight hours to be in this service eight hours to be in this service they watch us online they're part of our church here's a young man that's satan no doubts offering a lot of things and he's a very intelligent young man is it okay if i just share this with you they shared with me that he's already doing college work he's supremely intelligent he's a good-looking boy offering later he's single look around but here no doubt i know there's believers in new jersey i know that but there's millions of people there going in a different direction and god is rich in mercy [Music] god's rich in mercy to that young man and that family let me just say that's worth more than millions of dollars [Applause] so don't worry about this today when you think that after service they're going to travel eight hours to go home and they're going to count it a great time here's people sitting four hours they're going to get in their car after a while hopefully go eat lunch get in their car after a while and they're going to travel four hours because they're hungry they're hungry are you

brother ray and on the sixth service i read led a boy who was very against preachers because he'd been so hurt i led that boy to jesus christ i called your name ray because setting two seats from you was a boy that had swore he wouldn't sit in church and he actually had a very much of a dislike even for me i'm fine with that i'm really fine for that i'm okay with people that don't like me there's days i don't like me there's days connie don't like me i'd rather you didn't ask her after church but so you guys put my heating and hair units all in my house remember my words to you bring jason you're his wife jason left the house that morning one man when he was there was all he's full of life he's got a lot of stories to tell he's funny if you've never been around him get around him you wouldn't want to be around the old guy but this guy you you don't mind being around i told him i said you'd like to walk through my house i'd like to show you some things i took him in the house i walked him through the house i showed him showed him my house showed him things that meant a lot to me told him why why that we were doing the construction job that we were doing this house is built for god this is an atmosphere for god and i began to just talk to him a little bit i left i don't even remember i had appointments and i had to go he went home a different man because he got to see past what he saw i hope this is going to be okay we had prayer meetings in our home and we went around in a circle what's your prayer request and you said my mother and if you tilt your head to the right you'll see what you were praying for all of that time oh brother ron i've got so much trouble if you can see past what you see are you with me i'm just struggling right now to try to get you on board it was just only a few months ago something began to drive me we need new chairs in this building we need seating capacity in this building i had people ask me why because you're going to need it are you with me god's got hungry children and hungry children if they're not careful we'll eat out of a trash can but we want to provide eagle food here [Applause] i'm just about done but i don't want to miss something there's something i want to i want to get help my lord find it you okay okay whether you know it i'm going past 30 40 minutes real quick for you here so just give me just a second you nervous brother ron no you'd be nervous if i was still here two hours from now the scripture tells us that when melchizedek was sitting with abraham four generations later was a boy named levi born four generations and abraham is setting with melchizedek and melchizedek receives tithes from levi that's right and just to catch your attention here just for a moment you remember when brother branham was sitting on a log with brother biskell and and brother branham asked brother bischo have you heard anointed ones of the end time and brother brother biscuit said i was embarrassed but i told him no i haven't heard it he said i'm glad i told him no he hadn't preached it yet it'll be three years later but that eternal realm time is is not a deal are you with me brother brown looks back and he sees somebody 40 years ago and they're standing in front of him and he reruns their life right before them things they forgot he tells them what the clothes that they had on what color hair that they had now white was blonde god knows you and in that eternal realm it's not your problems he's looking at and maybe you even ask how did i get here i wasn't looking for this me and you're having a conversation now how did i get here what's god doing he's seeing way past a black shirt with a white undershirt way past grand black hair he's sitting way past that rim looking deep in the saw abraham will have isaac and isaac will have jacob and jacob will have levi i didn't take the time to measure the the years that would transpire between abraham sitting with melchizedek to levi even being born much less becoming a priest you catch that god's not so interested in what so many times we're interested in we're in such a hurry we're in such a hurry for god to do things and in that realm he's got it all taken care of would it be okay if i tell one more story and enjoying this tj yeah i can see you're just kind of like a light bulb sitting there i'm not talking about your hair you can tell when somebody's just loving what they're enjoying because they're just illuminated there are some visitations that i just will not tell because they're so sacred to me and i'm not going to share it this morning and it had to do with the greater esther i've only told you portions of it the greater esther and in that visitation it was a conversation that was had about the greater esther things i would not understand and even there's still some things that's kind of i don't understand today and i had shared that with at length with brother tim pruitt because of his wife and then his daughter esther this might come home real quick and so i'd shared it with him but i had only shared maybe with one or two shared it with my family and i'm sitting with a group of preachers after at brother tim pruitt's home and i i don't know maybe 30 40. and i'm sitting there and we're all sitting and we're just conversing backwards and forwards a lot of different things are being talked about a lot of you know a lot of it's just a fellowship it's a it's a fellowship and i'm sitting there and the lord just begins to urge me to tell the story and i thought you know this is i i don't want to tell it i don't want to tell it in a until where people will take it unsacred i i don't want to tell it if someone would take it unsacred or or myself trying to make myself something i'm not i want you to follow me just for a moment i'm even being guarded how i say that but anyway i i just sat there and finally it just was a push and i said well maybe i could share something with you and this is very sacred to me and as i began to share it and as i came toward the completion i noticed a count in its own brother jason jackson that will be here is it next weekend two weekends brother jason jackson whom i'm fan of i really like him and he was sitting over there i noticed his counting exchanging and and after a bit he just he just jumped up and he went outside and he said i felt like speaking in tongues he said i i felt like speaking to esther's husband something and so he went outside he actually prayed lord forgive me for for quenching the spirit lord help us to have that kind of heart and he said he said i he finally came back in and he was talking to jeff esther's husband and he said jeff you've been looking for children the angel said you'd have a child and you lost a child he said god spoke to me a few moments ago that when sister karen slipped beyond this realm of time and people were shaking her hands and shaking her hands no doubt she shook my mother's hand she shook her mother's hand there was a lot of a reunion she shook she shook a baby's hand that's now full grown and she called her mummy and she realized that esther their child was standing there my brother jason told that it was a wave went through the building it was a wave of the holy ghost just went through the building it just it just literally is going backwards and forwards and i'm sharing something very dear to me now you see none of us could see until god pulled back the curtain and that which was so painful for esther and jeff all of a sudden become so elated that god's got it all in control and now a woman that has suffered with brain bleeds and she served the life and let me just say no it's not fair life isn't fair life is not fair so many times but for her to step from this dimension to that dimension and know all things what a place what a place i'm can i have just another minute because i want to talk to you if he could turn you by the shoulders sister
