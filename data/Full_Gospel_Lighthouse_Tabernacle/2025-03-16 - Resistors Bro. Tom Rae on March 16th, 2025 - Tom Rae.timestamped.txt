[47:27] yday my what a service that we had last
[47:31] night oh don't you thank the Lord that
[47:34] the silence is over we've seen Christ
[47:38] revealed in hi in Simplicity revealed
[47:41] right here amongst us and it's
[47:47] over today it's my greatest honor to
[47:50] introduce my precious friend brother Tom
[47:54] Ray and many of you know my story
[47:58] many of you don't but if it had not been
[48:01] for this
[48:03] man the very dynamics of this church
[48:05] would be completely different my
[48:08] marriage would be completely
[48:10] different this church everything about
[48:12] it would be completely different for the
[48:15] last 18 years
[48:18] now because a
[48:21] [Music]
[48:24] man because a man was l the Lord to say
[48:27] the right things in the right moment
[48:29] even on the streets in one of the
[48:32] busiest towns God came looking for me
[48:36] when I may have not have been looking
[48:38] for him he used a man by the name of
[48:40] Thomas Ray to come and speak directly to
[48:43] my heart now God could because we
[48:46] recognize that we are predestinated
[48:48] seeds God could have used any way to get
[48:50] a hold of us but he chose he could have
[48:52] got the trees to preach the gospel to me
[48:55] he could have got the winds but he chose
[48:57] who he redeemed a Son of God to come and
[49:00] speak the right
[49:01] words his ministry is well known around
[49:04] the world but it's really well known
[49:06] right here in Full Gospel
[49:08] Lighthouse and I just want to say what a
[49:11] blessing it is to have the man of God
[49:14] that has led me to the Lord to be here
[49:17] at our home church we were so blessed
[49:20] last year by brother Michael and brother
[49:23] Tom's
[49:24] Ministry we are so blessed again this

[56:45] my soul it's helped my family it saved
[56:48] my sons it's done everything to me my
[56:53] father-in-law brother Ron you've meant
[56:56] the world to us and and you know we can
[57:00] say these things but I want you to feel
[57:02] my heart come on I don't want you hear
[57:05] my words I want you to hear my
[57:08] heart and a prophet was without honor in
[57:11] his own country but we cherish your
[57:16] pastor we cherish their Ministry you say
[57:20] well that's what just brother so and so
[57:22] no it's not on no it's not and they've
[57:26] done so much for
[57:31] me I had the ability to say the other
[57:34] day to brother
[57:36] Ron David and Jonathan were very special
[57:40] I'm not David but I know I might be a
[57:44] Jonathan brother Ron you're my David and
[57:47] I love you for
[57:51] that thank you for making us feel so at
[57:54] home these oh yeah last few years
[57:59] and what are we nothing but sons of God
[58:03] saved by
[58:04] grace it's all by grace and you know
[58:08] brother Michael he preached he I used to
[58:11] say did I used to move like that I mean
[58:14] he covered the
[58:16] platform and then I saw a gate opening
[58:18] here and I thought he was going to cover
[58:20] the uh the
[58:22] sanctuary but but it was lovely amen I I
[58:27] told brother Ron years ago I'm getting
[58:29] older and
[58:30] slower for
[58:32] these and
[58:37] uh I love his people and if we can
[58:41] deposit just something that's all I'm
[58:45] not a
[58:46] speaker but I love the Lord and I love
[58:50] this message and what people don't
[58:53] understand it's one and the same that's
[58:55] what they do don't
[58:57] get they go to an extreme this way and
[58:59] they go to an extreme that way but I
[59:02] love what God shows us God himself
[59:05] veiled in a Prophet comeing this
[59:07] generation to find
[59:10] me to find me and so this morning uh
[59:15] just a little thought would you mind
[59:18] taking your Bibles and thank you again
[59:20] for making us feel so at home but I'd
[59:23] like to turn to John 14
[59:28] very familiar scripture of course you
[59:31] won't hear anything
[59:42] new but you'll if the Lord would help us
[59:46] maybe as my brother Michael was saying
[59:49] last night if we can just get that
[59:51] pipeline of Revelation down into our
[59:55] hearts changes everything and how many
[59:58] of us can testify you came to a service
[1:00:00] one day and all of a sudden the preacher
[1:00:04] goes a different way and it seems like
[1:00:06] you're in nowhere's Ville and the Holy
[1:00:09] Spirit comes to your
[1:00:12] vill and touches you and you go how did
[1:00:16] that happen because he loves
[1:00:19] you and he loves you so much he came
[1:00:22] personally to you in this gener
[1:00:26] generation it you know we we say well
[1:00:28] God sent a prophet and yes indeed he did
[1:00:31] but it was God in a prophet and I had
[1:00:34] the privilege and ability to be able to
[1:00:37] be with our dear pastor
[1:00:40] bisc and you
[1:00:44] know God in flesh in in a prophet sat it
[1:00:48] beside him and in a log somewhere and
[1:00:52] and and that's that becomes almost a
[1:00:54] story because we've heard it but I want
[1:00:58] you to understand that that same God
[1:01:01] came to
[1:01:03] me right we we we look at it in a
[1:01:06] historical form but that same God came
[1:01:12] to you right and is here this morning
[1:01:16] right to move you right into another
[1:01:19] channel that you have not
[1:01:22] experienced and all I can say I feel the
[1:01:27] pull and I hear the
[1:01:30] call and I want to come up
[1:01:33] higher higher in Christ and I'm a type
[1:01:37] of preacher that watches you so if you
[1:01:38] fall asleep I know
[1:01:41] you I know if you're responding or
[1:01:45] not and and it doesn't matter whether
[1:01:47] you're in the corner or way over here I
[1:01:49] watching you boys last night my goodness
[1:01:52] I wish I was that young in this presence
[1:01:56] I didn't get Sav till I was 21 but I
[1:01:59] always wanted God from a young boy and
[1:02:02] to think these boys have the privilege
[1:02:05] to hear what they hear and experience
[1:02:07] the atmosphere that they do parents God
[1:02:12] bless you for raising children such as
[1:02:14] this amen and may God bless your homes
[1:02:18] yes you want me to keep you standing all
[1:02:21] day I can do that
[1:02:24] too I would will be as brother bisc
[1:02:27] always used to say hey well I'm standing
[1:02:28] you might as well stand with me well
[1:02:31] we'll get you
[1:02:33] seated Psalm uh Psalms John's Chapter
[1:02:39] 14 verse
[1:02:42] one like I said I want you to feel my
[1:02:46] heart this
[1:02:51] morning let not your
[1:02:54] heart be
[1:03:01] troubled you believe in
[1:03:04] God believe also in
[1:03:07] me that in my father's
[1:03:11] house are many
[1:03:14] mansions and if it were not so I would
[1:03:17] have told you I go to
[1:03:21] prepare a place for you verse 13
[1:03:28] and whatsoever you shall
[1:03:31] ask
[1:03:34] now let's let's forget about this Bible
[1:03:37] being written 2,000 years
[1:03:40] ago because that word is Christ and that
[1:03:44] Christ is alive right so now he's
[1:03:48] speaking to us from his word
[1:03:52] himself now I'm looking at you
[1:03:56] and you might have a need this
[1:03:58] morning we can get lost in the
[1:04:02] crowd and feel so
[1:04:07] alone but I want them to come down to
[1:04:09] your
[1:04:11] Pew I want him to speak to
[1:04:15] you as one brother said the other day if
[1:04:18] you can get a hold of two mocking kids
[1:04:20] in another
[1:04:21] room and the presence of God come down
[1:04:26] and say to a lovely sister whatsoever
[1:04:28] you
[1:04:30] desire ask anything yes sir we've seen
[1:04:33] it manifested in our day and so let me
[1:04:37] say he can manifest it this morning amen
[1:04:40] and I don't care where you are right now
[1:04:43] this is the word of God to your
[1:04:45] soul
[1:04:48] whatsoever you shall ask in my
[1:04:53] name that will I
[1:04:57] who's reading your Bible with
[1:05:00] me whatsoever you ask in my name that I
[1:05:04] might
[1:05:05] do what did he
[1:05:08] say whatsoever you ask in my name in
[1:05:13] this manifested word of your hour is the
[1:05:18] name of the Lord Jesus Christ and if you
[1:05:22] ask anything now don't put it to the
[1:05:24] preachers I'm putting it down into your
[1:05:26] lap right now I don't care if you're a
[1:05:29] mother a single brother I don't care if
[1:05:31] you're a single sister I don't care if
[1:05:33] you're married or whatever the case may
[1:05:35] be whether you're a grandparent whether
[1:05:38] you're old or whether you're young my
[1:05:41] Bible says
[1:05:42] whosoever ask anything in my name
[1:05:48] you shall have it but the Bible says in
[1:05:52] this scripture I will
[1:05:54] do and my God does not
[1:05:58] lie so I don't care where you are right
[1:06:01] now and I don't care what need you have
[1:06:03] right
[1:06:05] now why don't you just bow your head and
[1:06:08] say Lord this is my
[1:06:10] need you said you'll do it if I ask you
[1:06:15] want to raise your hand you want to lift
[1:06:17] up both

[1:13:51] yeah did you dial SOS this morning
[1:13:56] Lord save my
[1:13:58] soul you know you think about it I mean
[1:14:00] I I we come from Vancouver Canada and
[1:14:05] and brother Ron says to me he says you
[1:14:06] know you'll see a couple of hospitals as
[1:14:08] you're driving down this way your tiny
[1:14:10] hospitals are bigger than our big
[1:14:13] hospitals but all they're intended to do
[1:14:16] is to help
[1:14:17] people and that's a good thing right but
[1:14:21] we come to church that King Jesus will
[1:14:24] help us am amen so if they do it for the
[1:14:28] natural man surely the Lord who is the
[1:14:30] great physician now is here the
[1:14:32] sympathizing Jesus then that Jesus is
[1:14:36] present now amen first
[1:14:39] Samuel I said first Samuel first uh
[1:14:42] Genesis 1 first chapter in the
[1:14:48] beginning in the beginning what does it
[1:14:51] say
[1:14:56] in the beginning God created the Heaven
[1:14:58] and Earth I was on the airplane one day
[1:15:00] and there was a businessman and I got
[1:15:02] bumped up the business class and I'm
[1:15:04] sitting here and say oh this is how they
[1:15:07] live I go this is nice linen and all
[1:15:10] that sort of stuff and I was reading my
[1:15:13] Bible and he says I can't understand
[1:15:15] that Bible I said what's wrong with
[1:15:18] [Applause]
[1:15:21] you it's a love story what
[1:15:25] I said it's a the Bible it's God in
[1:15:30] print well I don't understand God I said
[1:15:33] I
[1:15:34] do well how do you do I said God sent a
[1:15:37] prophet to open the Bible to us well he
[1:15:41] says I got a problem with Genesis 1:1 I
[1:15:44] said I don't
[1:15:46] hallelu he says well you know how does
[1:15:50] that all work the bi you know science
[1:15:53] says the Earth is here for for billions
[1:15:55] of years I says you're not reading your
[1:15:57] Bible right come on that's right I I
[1:16:01] said let me help you read Genesis 1:1 in
[1:16:04] the beginning God created the Heaven and
[1:16:08] Earth
[1:16:10] period did it say
[1:16:12] billions billions it's period it's
[1:16:15] whatever length of time he wanted oh he
[1:16:18] says I never s that way before I said
[1:16:21] stick with me
[1:16:25] that's right it's totally right so God
[1:16:29] in the beginning created the Heaven and
[1:16:33] the
[1:16:34] Earth that's
[1:16:37] omnipotence that God is
[1:16:40] Elohim Almighty
[1:16:45] amen so now when we say God you say well
[1:16:48] brother Tom we use the the term God and
[1:16:50] God lives in me well then who's living
[1:16:53] in you on the god that created the
[1:16:55] heavens and the Earth is living in you
[1:16:58] so what's your
[1:17:01] problem I told you I'm going to get down
[1:17:03] to your address because I I actually
[1:17:06] believe this we all go through some
[1:17:08] horrific
[1:17:09] things we all go through horrific things
[1:17:12] but if you understand that God's living
[1:17:14] in your life then he's in control of
[1:17:16] everything that I go through so then
[1:17:19] everything that I go through means it's
[1:17:20] for my good amen that's right so
[1:17:24] everything I go you say that's bad who
[1:17:25] says it's
[1:17:27] bad come on you know we all we always
[1:17:30] want to class things as bad and you find
[1:17:31] out at the end of the at the end of the
[1:17:33] road as the doors started to open up
[1:17:35] that was God that was God that was God
[1:17:37] that was God but when you're walking
[1:17:39] through the door you don't see God right

[1:17:56] field all you would be is a grease
[1:18:01] spot but we always look at things after
[1:18:05] the fact let's get in the fact because
[1:18:09] he's a God that was which is and shall
[1:18:11] be so whatever was is and shall be so
[1:18:14] what he was there he is right now if
[1:18:17] he's the god that created heaven and

[1:28:24] boxing day but it's the day after
[1:28:27] Christmas in Canada we call it Boxing
[1:28:29] Day really doesn't take too much of
[1:28:32] intelligence you get a lot of
[1:28:34] boxes so they give you a day to get rid
[1:28:37] of the boxes
[1:28:41] whatever so they're over at the house
[1:28:43] and they're having their little thing
[1:28:46] together and they our our boys have
[1:28:48] heard it often but but this is real to
[1:28:50] me this
[1:28:51] morning a four years de old
[1:28:55] boy and I got a fire engine I'm sorry a
[1:28:59] dump truck I wanted a fire
[1:29:02] engine a dump
[1:29:06] truck a dump truck fire engine dad what
[1:29:09] are you
[1:29:11] thinking so they're all over and they're
[1:29:13] all saying and my sister got a nurses
[1:29:15] thing with you know the stethoscope and
[1:29:17] a little thing and a little cape and a
[1:29:19] little hat and she's going to be a nurse
[1:29:21] and of course Tommy what do you want to
[1:29:23] be you want to be a policeman of course
[1:29:24] were a fireman I said I never got my
[1:29:27] fire
[1:29:30] truck but I love that little old dumb
[1:29:34] truck and so they said well what do you
[1:29:36] want to be when you grow up I don't we
[1:29:38] don't have you know our TVs in the Dark
[1:29:40] Ages had
[1:29:42] fuzz you know those that know what I'm
[1:29:45] talking about raise your hand then we
[1:29:47] know how old you
[1:29:49] are you know you put it on there bunch
[1:29:53] of black and white do thoughts and you
[1:29:54] try to see a figure then the antenna you
[1:29:56] got to go up on the
[1:29:58] roof stay up
[1:30:03] there right and so you know I don't so I
[1:30:07] haven't seen an evangelist I don't go to
[1:30:09] church my mom and dad don't go to church
[1:30:10] I don't have
[1:30:13] nothing but they said what do you want
[1:30:15] to be when you grow up Tom what do you
[1:30:17] want to be I said I want to be a
[1:30:21] preacher they go what
[1:30:25] ruined their
[1:30:28] party but when you're Prophet says that
[1:30:32] you've got a seed in you that came from
[1:30:35] almighty God and in the beginning he
[1:30:39] laid out that seed on the earth and knew
[1:30:42] you would be living in this generation
[1:30:45] and knew you would come to a harvest
[1:30:47] time and what he is you are
[1:30:51] [Applause]
[1:30:54] Hallelujah and so when I saw the word in
[1:30:58] flesh I didn't understand the word my
[1:31:00] friend gets saved I didn't understand
[1:31:02] what he's talking about you need to be G
[1:31:03] born again what's born again I didn't
[1:31:05] know what born again was all I knew that
[1:31:08] he was a party Monger like I was a party
[1:31:09] monger and God got a hold of him and he
[1:31:12] went to church and I admired the god in
[1:31:14] him I said that's the God that I want
[1:31:18] and guess what God did to me he saved me
[1:31:23] he saved
[1:31:24] me and gave me the desire of my heart
[1:31:28] right since a little boy and God had a
[1:31:32] way of putting me through the the
[1:31:35] channel to get me to the place where the
[1:31:39] word of God would become

[1:44:46] me all right so we did it Devil's on
[1:44:51] here he's sitting on of steps out
[1:44:54] there and when you go out there you say
[1:44:57] get off my
[1:45:00] steps and when he comes and sits on your
[1:45:03] car get off my
[1:45:06] car we're
[1:45:08] resistors we're resisting to Satan every
[1:45:12] time Satan throws anything on you rebuke
[1:45:16] it Satan's Army brings
[1:45:19] diseases God's Army are Commission right
[1:45:24] to cast them
[1:45:28] out do we believe that church we
[1:45:31] absolutely believe it I don't care where
[1:45:34] he hides you cannot hide from the Holy
[1:45:38] Ghost
[1:45:42] period
[1:45:44] period that's
[1:45:46] right he says cast it out that's the
[1:45:50] very technique that God used
[1:45:53] Satan used the army of Destruction to
[1:45:57] believe disbelieve God's word and to set
[1:46:01] him up a better Kingdom than Michael but
[1:46:04] God cast him out now we're going back to
[1:46:09] First Genesis 1 then God cast them out
[1:46:14] at that day you will know that I am in
[1:46:19] the Father the father's in me I in you
[1:46:23] you and you in me brother Ram said
[1:46:26] that's this
[1:46:28] day all that God was he poured into
[1:46:33] Christ right everybody still with me now
[1:46:37] we just boot the devil out don't get
[1:46:38] quiet on me now this is where you should
[1:46:40] be rejoicing all that God was in Genesis
[1:46:43] 1 amen came in John
[1:46:47] 114 was made flesh and dwelt Among Us so
[1:46:52] all that God was he poured into Christ
[1:46:55] all that he poured into Christ he poured
[1:46:57] into the
[1:46:58] church now listen to me somehow Satan
[1:47:02] gets in there and says well then if
[1:47:03] God's in all the church he's a little
[1:47:05] diminished there because there's so many
[1:47:07] in the church well let me let me just
[1:47:09] take you back to Deuteronomy when Moses
[1:47:13] and Jethro said you take too much on you
[1:47:16] Moses call out 70 men and that the
[1:47:19] spirit of God but re on them but the
[1:47:21] scripture goes on to say
[1:47:23] and it did not
[1:47:25] diminish what was on Moses so all that
[1:47:29] God was he poured into Christ all that
[1:47:33] Christ was he poured into
[1:47:37] you so let me ask you a question where
[1:47:40] is
[1:47:42] [Applause]
[1:47:43] God what can God do the
[1:47:47] [Music]
[1:47:49] impossible I loved in perfect faith
[1:47:51] brother R said I'm trying to to raise
[1:47:53] your faith a little higher I'm trying to
[1:47:54] raise a little higher you want
[1:47:56] discernment but I'll tell you this why
[1:47:58] don't you just walk by me and I'll lay
[1:47:59] hands on you and in the name of Jesus

[1:48:27] feet and raised their hands said we're

[1:48:35] word you shall lay hands on the sick and
[1:48:37] they shall
[1:48:39] recover you shall pick up by serent a
[1:48:41] serpent and Sh not hurt thee right Paul

[1:48:54] is
[1:48:55] magnificent I wish I had the English
[1:48:58] language to describe how powerful and

[1:52:22] the scriptures on that I've taught this
[1:52:27] people that God is in

[1:53:16] said Satan you know the scripture on it
[1:53:18] I've taught the people this that God is

[1:53:53] devil he hasn't caught the Revelation
[1:53:55] yet but he's got to
[1:53:58] flee that's right hold on for dear life
[1:54:02] he's still got to flee he might have his
[1:54:05] fingernails still stuck in there but
[1:54:06] he's got to let go because the word of
[1:54:09] God said
[1:54:10] so so now let me ask I won't look I
[1:54:15] won't look and you don't even have to
[1:54:16] look raise your

[2:01:20] God yes sir
[2:01:23] Genesis 1 let's read it again let's read
[2:01:26] it
[2:01:27] again Genesis 1:1 let's read it out loud
[2:01:31] and
[2:01:32] clear in the beginning God created the
[2:01:37] Heaven and the
[2:01:39] Earth right perfect that's perfect all
[2:01:44] right so
[2:01:46] now listen to what brother Ram says can
[2:01:49] I can I quote a prophet of course they
[2:01:51] can I'm I know I can't I'm just asking a
[2:01:53] factious
[2:01:54] question in my
[2:01:57] commission now I'm just your
[2:02:00] brother but by the grace of God when the
[2:02:03] angel of the Lord moves
[2:02:07] down then I am the voice of God to
[2:02:13] you maybe it offended you by saying that
[2:02:17] forgive
[2:02:18] me I felt that might have been resented
[2:02:23] so let me say it
[2:02:26] again you might be offended at a little
[2:02:28] man from Cloverdale Bible Way came down
[2:02:31] to your little church and trying to tell
[2:02:33] you who you are in Christ
[2:02:35] Jesus you might be offended but I'll say
[2:02:39] it
[2:02:41] again I'll say it
[2:02:44] again when God comes down I am the voice
[2:02:48] of God to
[2:02:50] you well you see that was brother
[2:02:52] brandham where is The Voice
[2:02:56] she is the final
[2:02:59] voice to the final
[2:03:03] age that might offend you so I'll say it
[2:03:07] again if I've offended you by saying
[2:03:09] that forgive me I felt that that might
[2:03:12] have been resented I am the God's voice
[2:03:15] to you I say that again that time was
[2:03:19] under inspiration you see I felt about
[2:03:22] it the first time but I repeated it
[2:03:24] again and you might you might feel bad
[2:03:28] what we preach over the pulpit then why
[2:03:30] is he repeating
[2:03:31] it because maybe you felt bad and he
[2:03:36] wanted you to get it
[2:03:43] again unusual thinking man's filter I've
[2:03:47] seen the light I've turned around and
[2:03:50] there stood seven golden Candlestick
[2:03:52] standing up there on top of the mountain
[2:03:55] with a rainbow that was coming up
[2:03:58] through the pipes and feeding out
[2:04:01] immediately after that the Lord Jesus
[2:04:04] appeared to us and right then I heard
[2:04:07] the voice say
[2:04:09] Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus
[2:04:14] Christ of the New
[2:04:16] Testament amen there it is after a while
[2:04:21] it's revealed through those seven golden
[2:04:24] candlesticks through those Messengers
[2:04:27] God was revealing Jesus of the old or
[2:04:30] Jehovah of the old is Jesus of the
[2:04:34] new all that God was he poured into
[2:04:39] Christ so God
[2:04:42] Elohim the one who stood but in front of
[2:04:44] Abraham's tent is the same one that's
[2:04:47] standing right before your
[2:04:50] tent right there
[2:04:52] now what are you going to do you can sit
[2:04:55] there and look at me and play dumb or
[2:04:58] you can say hey I got to kill a fatted
[2:05:00] calf I got to give my sacrifice a
[2:05:04] praise come on he sacrific had to kill a
[2:05:10] cal huh he sacrificed to have God speak
[2:05:14] to
[2:05:18] him amen hallelujah
[2:05:22] praise the
[2:05:26] Lord
[2:05:30] amen yes God rich in Mercy comes by our
[2:05:33] tent but this God so Jehovah the oldest
[2:05:36] Jesus of the new we've caught that
[2:05:38] Mighty Revelation that's come for me and
[2:05:40] you as a songwriter said but Jehovah of
[2:05:43] the
[2:05:44] old is the I
[2:05:47] am is that true it's true
[2:05:52] Jehovah Elohim I am who shall I say sent
[2:05:57] me I am sent me sent you I am what a
[2:06:02] name I am what did Jesus
[2:06:05] say oh we'll get

[2:06:20] this Sheepfold I am the Good Shepherd
[2:06:23] come on the I am is Jesus Christ is that
[2:06:26] right Jehovah of the old is Jesus of the
[2:06:29] new it's a mighty Revelation that's come
[2:06:31] for me and you he's not a
[2:06:36] trinity are you listening now so
[2:06:40] now Jesus said in John 635 if you want
[2:06:44] to write it down I'm the bread of life
[2:06:45] John 8 12 says I am the light of the
[2:06:47] world John 10 and 7 said I am the door
[2:06:50] John 10 uh 11 said I am the Good
[2:06:53] Shepherd John 11:25 said I am the
[2:06:56] resurrection and the life John 14:16
[2:06:58] said I am the way the truth and the life
[2:07:00] John 15 says I am the True

[2:19:15] listened to tapes right somebody shout
[2:19:18] it out
[2:19:20] first I heard over here okay that's the
[2:19:23] preacher we'll leave them over here what
[2:19:25] does it justified
[2:19:28] mean so what are you worried
[2:19:34] about so then whatever sin you did do
[2:19:39] Matthew and every sin you will do
[2:19:42] Matthew and every sin you might do
[2:19:45] Matthew is
[2:19:48] Justified you didn't do it
[2:19:51] in the first
[2:19:57] place it doesn't give you a license to
[2:19:59] sin then you make the word of God a
[2:20:02] disgrace but what what the word of God's
[2:20:05] telling us we're Justified you didn't do
[2:20:07] it in the first place that you are them
[2:20:11] he
[2:20:12] also say a little louder for me I'm
[2:20:15] deaf thank you I heard
[2:20:18] that he you he glorified is that
[2:20:23] right what shall we say then to these
[2:20:33] things me I just want to stomp that
[2:20:37] devil a little bit
[2:20:39] harder what shall we say then to these
[2:20:46] things
[2:20:48] called Justified

[2:21:17] this you said well you're talking too
[2:21:19] loud already
[2:21:21] come on I'd like to let everybody know
[2:21:24] in
[2:21:25] Elton come on I'm
[2:21:28] called you know what that means god
[2:21:30] called me and if God called me Satan you
[2:21:34] can't have
[2:21:36] me he never changes his mind about his
[2:21:44] word did you get that did God call
[2:21:48] you then he can't lose lose
[2:21:51] you it's
[2:21:53] impossible that would make God a liar
[2:21:55] and God cannot lie he's not a man that
[2:21:57] he would
[2:21:58] lie so then he called me he justified me
[2:22:04] and now he glorified me is that what is
[2:22:07] that what the Bible says here all right
[2:22:09] okay you can sit down you can relax
[2:22:12] we'll get you on your feet again don't
[2:22:13] you
[2:22:14] worry we're not done we'll get done I'm
[2:22:16] sorry for being so long just please
[2:22:20] forgive me me you might not have me back
[2:22:22] next
[2:22:23] year but listen so now you've been forn
[2:22:30] right those he did for
[2:22:35] no this should end the question you
[2:22:38] should be in Victory yeah every time you
[2:22:42] come to
[2:22:44] church after these scriptures and I I'm
[2:22:47] I'm not being factious now I'm I'm
[2:22:50] actually being very honest with
[2:22:56] you the for knowledge of God refers in
[2:23:00] the Greek that it is a
[2:23:05] legal binding commitment right it's
[2:23:11] legal and it's not in the court of man
[2:23:14] right it's in the court of
[2:23:17] God you can say to the devil this is a
[2:23:22] legal binding
[2:23:26] contract chosen of God marked as his own
[2:23:32] before the creation of the
[2:23:35] world so he's known you a long
[2:23:40] time you said well I don't like this
[2:23:42] about me that's why he's working on
[2:23:45] you yeah because he's got in mind what
[2:23:48] you're to
[2:23:49] be and you're to be the word made flesh
[2:23:52] today that's right so the man of God the
[2:23:56] men of God that will Minister the word
[2:23:58] of God will preach the word so that you
[2:24:00] become the
[2:24:02] word all right so it's a legal binding
[2:24:08] contract a legal binding contract
[2:24:13] therefore before the church can have a
[2:24:15] Rapture they need to get into rapturing
[2:24:19] faith that will Quicken their bodies and
[2:24:22] be taken away and I believe the church
[2:24:27] is on the road
[2:24:33] tonight I'm looking at it I'm looking at
[2:24:37] it he was prophesying it and you can say
[2:24:41] here I
[2:24:42] am here I am I'm the forn of God before
[2:24:48] God was God that's
[2:24:51] right M we're going way back we're
[2:24:54] starting to drill
[2:24:56] now before God was God you were in the
[2:24:58] mind
[2:25:01] of he knew you'd be sitting there in
[2:25:04] that chair looking at me right now with
[2:25:07] a frown or with a
[2:25:10] smile ah they're all
[2:25:14] smiles God fornew
[2:25:16] you he's not going to lose you what does
[2:25:20] he say say in John not one of you can be
[2:25:22] plucked from my
[2:25:25] hand and just so that you could get it
[2:25:28] he says it
