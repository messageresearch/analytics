[46:44] run all
[46:46] but one receiveth the prize
[46:48] so run that you may obtain
[46:51] and every man that striveth for the
[46:53] mastery is tempered in all things

[48:02] bless you you may be seated in the
[48:04] presence of the lord i'd like to speak
[48:06] to you this morning on
[48:08] never give in
[48:10] and never give up
[48:12] never give in and never give up and
[48:16] life is
[48:17] certainly certainly a struggle that we
[48:19] go through and if you've been acquainted
[48:22] with life
[48:23] very much
[48:26] you've found out that life is a struggle
[48:28] there was one of the great philosophers
[48:30] in the in the man age that that that had
[48:34] several students and one of his students
[48:36] asked him said what is the secret to
[48:38] life and he told his follower to follow
[48:41] him down by the ocean side and he he
[48:43] walked all the way through the city and
[48:45] all the way down to the ocean side when
[48:48] he got down there the philosopher walked
[48:50] out into the water and he said follow me
[48:53] and he walked out into the water and he
[48:55] said stick your head in the water and
[48:57] when he stuck his head in the water then
[48:59] the philosopher put his hand over top of
[49:01] the man's head so that they had that he
[49:03] could not get up
[49:04] he was fighting with everything that was
[49:06] within him to get up and he had to fight
[49:08] to to push to push him push his hand off
[49:12] and finally he broke free and he was
[49:14] gasking gasping for air when he come
[49:16] back up to and
[49:18] the philosopher walked back onto the
[49:20] seashore and he stood there he said that
[49:23] is the secret to life you have to
[49:25] struggle to live
[49:27] and if you're acquainted with life and i
[49:30] believe we're all acquainted with life i
[49:31] don't believe we have any dead people
[49:33] here today the funeral was yesterday but
[49:35] we're preaching to the living today
[49:37] but life will throw you curveballs and
[49:40] life has a way of humbling you
[49:42] and life has a way of attempting to
[49:44] break you down and just when you feel
[49:46] like you're getting ahead in life there
[49:48] life will begin to throw you up against
[49:50] the guard rail and you'll over correct
[49:52] and all of a sudden you're coming in on
[49:54] the oncoming traffic and life will throw
[49:57] you for a loop but i want to say this to
[50:00] you as an encouragement today i don't
[50:03] know if you would say that this is
[50:04] preaching today but i want to encourage
[50:06] you to never give up
[50:08] i want to encourage you that no matter
[50:10] what comes your way to never give in and
[50:13] to never give up
[50:14] and brother branham would say he said
[50:16] maybe that's what he's doing to you
[50:18] tonight he might give you cancer he
[50:20] might give you this he might give you
[50:21] that he might give you a broke up home
[50:23] he might give you a tore up heart he
[50:25] might give you worries he might give you
[50:26] a headache see i don't know what he'll
[50:28] do but there's one thing that i do know
[50:31] that god has still got his eye on you
[50:34] that no matter what life can throw at
[50:36] you no matter where you are no matter
[50:38] what circumstance and one of the the the
[50:41] statements that brother daniel made last
[50:43] night that when the woman the the woman
[50:45] at the well had had been through her
[50:47] circumstances of life when she turned
[50:49] around the lord was there and david
[50:52] would say i could make my bed in hell
[50:54] and the lord was there if i ascended to
[50:56] the heights the lord is there he is
[50:59] jehovah shaman no matter what you go
[51:01] through in life the lord has got his eye
[51:04] on you and the only one who can make you
[51:08] give up
[51:09] is yourself
[51:11] the only one that can make you throw in
[51:13] the towel is yourself
[51:15] because the coach that is in your corner
[51:17] is the one that is telling you that you
[51:19] can persevere he is telling you that you
[51:22] can make it he is telling you you've got
[51:24] to get to a time in your life just like
[51:26] the syrophoenician woman got to that
[51:29] spot when she walked up to him and
[51:31] called him the son of david she didn't
[51:33] have no rights on him as a son of david
[51:36] but when she called him lord then she
[51:39] got his attention and maybe you don't
[51:41] have no rights on him as son of david
[51:44] because he's still not come in his
[51:46] kingdom as of yet but you do have a
[51:48] right as calling him your lord and when
[51:52] you call him your lord you are saying i
[51:55] am making you lord over my life lord
[51:57] over my soul lord over my situation and
[52:00] this little woman was just looking for a
[52:02] crumb that fell from the master's table
[52:05] and when jesus himself would not even
[52:09] turn towards her need but yet this lady
[52:13] was not willing that jesus would turn
[52:15] her down and she got to a spot that the
[52:18] prophet would preach a sermon on
[52:20] perseverance and would take this little
[52:23] woman that was a gentile woman that had
[52:26] to walk where nobody else would walk
[52:28] when nobody else wanted her at the table
[52:30] she was willing to get on her knees
[52:33] and you may have to get on your knees
[52:35] and you may have to crawl but don't you
[52:38] ever give in and don't you ever give up
[52:41] winston churchill said when you're going
[52:43] through hell keep on going and never
[52:46] never never give up
[52:48] when they were in the midst of the world
[52:50] war
[52:51] winston churchill took his country and
[52:54] he began to lead them and he began to
[52:56] speak unto them these famous words he
[52:58] said we shall go on to the end we shall
[53:01] fight in france we shall fight on the
[53:03] seas and oceans we shall fight with
[53:05] growing confidence and growing strength
[53:08] in the earth and shall defend our island
[53:11] whatever the cost may be we shall fight
[53:13] on the beaches we shall fight on the
[53:15] landing grounds we shall fight in the
[53:17] fields and in the streets we shall fight
[53:19] in the hills and we shall never
[53:22] surrender
[53:25] i have been i have been what you would
[53:27] say i've been through hell and been
[53:29] through high water but my testimony
[53:32] remains the same i will never give in
[53:35] and i will never give up i will not back
[53:37] off for god's promises i will not back
[53:40] off a god's a healer i will not back off
[53:43] of god as a god that saves our particles
[53:45] i will not back off that he is our
[53:48] redeemer i will not back off that he is
[53:50] our sustainer i will not back off that
[53:53] he's my banker i will not back off that
[53:55] he's my lawyer i will not back off that
[53:58] he will provide every single one of your
[54:01] needs i will not give in to the
[54:03] ideologies of humanity that say that
[54:06] he's a dead god but i will give in to
[54:08] the thought that he's the same yesterday
[54:11] today and forever
[54:17] now i'm not preaching to you this
[54:19] morning
[54:20] i'm just encouraging you
[54:23] so you can take this as a motivation or
[54:25] you can take this as preaching
[54:27] it's however you want to receive it
[54:30] but the bible said in isaiah 59 and 20
[54:32] so y'all keep yourself calm and i'll do
[54:34] my best to do the same because i'm not
[54:35] preaching
[54:37] the bible said in the redeemer shall
[54:39] come to zion
[54:40] and unto them that turn from true
[54:43] transgression and jacob save the lord as
[54:46] for me this is my covenant you you
[54:48] wonder why i'm saying i'm not preaching
[54:49] to you because i've been told i ain't a
[54:51] preacher so let me just say this to you
[54:54] i'm not preaching to you today i'm
[54:56] encouraging you
[54:57] but as for me as this is what the lord
[55:00] said as for me this is my covenant
[55:03] with him saith the lord my spirit
[55:06] that is upon thee and my words which i
[55:09] have put in thy mouth notice what he is
[55:11] saying my spirit is upon thee and my
[55:14] words which i have put in thy mouth say
[55:17] in thy mouth
[55:19] shall not depart out of thy mouth
[55:22] nor out of the mouth of thy seed nor out
[55:25] of the mouth of thy seed seed save the
[55:27] lord from henceforth and forever
[55:30] notice no matter where you go the spirit
[55:34] of the lord is upon you
[55:36] and the spirit of the lord is going to
[55:38] keep you the spirit of the lord is not
[55:40] going to lead you down some road that he
[55:42] can't get you out of
[55:44] the spirit of the lord is not going to
[55:45] lead you into a trouble that he ain't
[55:47] already got your escape route already
[55:50] figured out and notice when you get in
[55:52] that spot he'll be there but his word
[55:55] will be there as well
[55:59] notice what the what he would say in the
[56:01] patmos vision he said now paul said that
[56:04] the word came in power as well as voice
[56:07] the word preach actually demonstrated
[56:09] itself like a flaming cutting sword it
[56:12] went to the consciences of men like the
[56:14] surgeon's knife had cut out the diseases
[56:17] and set kept us free
[56:18] everywhere those early believers went
[56:22] just like men like yourself like women
[56:24] like yourself they went preaching the
[56:26] gospel and confirmed the word with signs
[56:29] following the sick were healed
[56:32] how many seen the sick healed
[56:34] devils were cast out and they spoke in
[56:37] new tongues and that was the word in
[56:40] action notice that word has never failed
[56:43] in the mouth of believing christians and
[56:45] in this last age it is here stronger and
[56:48] greater ever than ever in the true word
[56:51] bride oh little flock you little
[56:54] minority hold on to the word
[56:56] fill your mouth with it and your heart
[56:59] with it and someday god will give you
[57:02] the kingdom
[57:04] notice we can have an attitude of
[57:07] certainty because we are certain of who
[57:10] god is
[57:11] now you remember in the bible over in
[57:13] luke 18 i'll just read it to you just
[57:14] for a moment remember i'm not preaching
[57:16] to you and he spake a parable unto them
[57:19] to the sin that men ought to always pray
[57:21] and not faint saying there was in a city
[57:23] a judge which feared not god neither
[57:26] regarded man and there was a widow in
[57:28] that city and she came unto him saying
[57:31] avenge me of mine adversary
[57:34] and he would not for a while but
[57:35] afterwards he he said within himself
[57:37] though i fear not god nor regard man yet
[57:40] because this widow troubleth me
[57:43] i will avenge her notice
[57:46] notice notice because of the trouble
[57:49] that she was giving him what was he
[57:51] doing he was disrupting his daily
[57:53] activities
[57:55] she was in a spot where she was
[57:57] disrupting what he was doing and she
[57:59] became a burden unto him
[58:03] he said but yet because this widow
[58:05] troubleth me i will avenge her lest by
[58:09] her continual coming she weary me
[58:12] by her continual knocking at my door
[58:16] i will get faint and i'll get wore out
[58:21] this was a woman
[58:23] because of her situation that life had
[58:26] thrown at her she began to knock
[58:29] because he said knock
[58:31] she began to ask because he said you
[58:34] shall receive she began to knock and
[58:36] because she realized that he would open
[58:39] the door to her
[58:41] and the lord said hear
[58:44] what this unjust judge said
[58:46] and shall not god avenge his own elect
[58:49] which cry day and night unto him though
[58:52] he bear
[58:53] along with them i tell you that he will
[58:55] avenge them speedily
[58:59] he will avenge them immediately
[59:03] nevertheless when the son of man cometh
[59:05] shall he find faith on the earth
[59:09] what a powerful thing he didn't come and
[59:11] say now will he find righteousness will
[59:13] he find holiness but will he find
[59:16] faith i believe god has stepped into
[59:19] this hour and has looked out upon a
[59:21] congregation of the bride of jesus
[59:23] christ and found a people of faith
[59:26] now notice now jesus taught that same
[59:28] thing how about the unjust judge and the
[59:30] widow that he wouldn't he wouldn't
[59:32] revenge her although she cried day and
[59:34] night he
[59:35] well he revenged her enemies just to get
[59:37] rid of her
[59:38] said how much more will your heavenly
[59:40] father give them the holy ghost who ask
[59:43] him that's what we want now notice this
[59:45] he says now if you don't believe that
[59:47] the holy spirit's real
[59:49] take a hold of god's promise and just
[59:52] stay with it
[59:53] now this he's not talking to a believer
[59:56] he's talking to somebody that don't have
[59:58] faith enough to believe
[1:00:00] that this is for them he said but if you
[1:00:03] don't believe the holy spirit's real
[1:00:05] take a hold of god's promise and just
[1:00:07] stay with it
[1:00:09] hold on to it don't leave it if you
[1:00:12] don't believe it he's a healer whatever
[1:00:14] disease or trouble you have right now
[1:00:16] don't wait to healing to the healing
[1:00:18] line just take a hold of it right now
[1:00:21] and say god i'm on your hands
[1:00:24] he is speaking to an individual or a
[1:00:27] person that would say well i don't know
[1:00:29] whether god is or i don't know what
[1:00:30] he'll do
[1:00:31] but he's saying if you don't know this i
[1:00:34] want you to hold on to his promises
[1:00:37] this is somebody that doesn't understand
[1:00:39] the concept of god and how god works but
[1:00:43] here we are the children of the light
[1:00:45] and children of faith
[1:00:48] how much more do you know the promises
[1:00:51] of god how much more do you know that
[1:00:54] god will keep his promises how much more
[1:00:56] do you know that he's more than able to
[1:00:58] do exceedingly abundantly above all that
[1:01:01] you can ever ask or think according to
[1:01:03] the power that works in you as a son and
[1:01:07] daughter of the most high god you are a
[1:01:09] believer how much more should you allow
[1:01:12] your opportunity not to not pass you by
[1:01:18] now satan will say now you're no better
[1:01:20] that's what he told me he said now i
[1:01:22] said look at oh slew foot if you want
[1:01:24] you you like to hear me testify about
[1:01:27] the glory of god stick around but you
[1:01:29] ain't going to shake me away from that
[1:01:31] that's your testimony of believer if you
[1:01:34] like to hear the testimonies of god and
[1:01:36] the praises of divine healing stay
[1:01:38] around i'm gonna wring it out just as
[1:01:39] long as i can just stay right with it
[1:01:42] stick around listen at it i'll invite
[1:01:44] you to listen at it and stay around
[1:01:46] first day no better next day no better
[1:01:49] next day no better and i just kept
[1:01:51] saying staying and testifying and
[1:01:53] praising god pressing through the dark
[1:01:56] clouds he made a promise finally there
[1:01:58] it was he'll get tired after away after
[1:02:01] a while and run away
[1:02:04] here was a a testimony of a believer
[1:02:07] that would never give in and never give
[1:02:09] up it's not what you see
[1:02:13] jesus would say that when you go to
[1:02:16] prayer to go into your prayer cloths and
[1:02:19] when you get in your prayer closet shut
[1:02:21] the door and when you get inside of
[1:02:23] there go to praying to the god that
[1:02:26] hears in secret but the god that hears
[1:02:29] in secret he will reward you openly
[1:02:33] god is not ashamed to bless you because
[1:02:35] you were in a spot that you got in when
[1:02:38] nobody else was around you when nobody
[1:02:40] else could pick you up when nobody else
[1:02:43] was around you to say you can make it
[1:02:45] but you went in there all alone but when
[1:02:48] you got on the outside god said i'm
[1:02:50] gonna bless you
[1:02:51] i'm gonna bless you everything you touch
[1:02:54] gonna be blessed everywhere you put your
[1:02:56] hand on it's gonna be blessed i bless
[1:02:58] you coming in i bless you going out i
[1:03:01] bring your children back because my word
[1:03:04] will not depart out of your mouth
[1:03:08] i ain't preaching to you i'm encouraging
[1:03:11] take back what the devil stole from you
[1:03:16] [Applause]
[1:03:25] when elijah walked up there with a woman
[1:03:28] here she come with her circumstance of
[1:03:30] life
[1:03:31] and elijah said to hazel you go take my
[1:03:33] rod down there
[1:03:36] you laid on that boy
[1:03:39] i know what i'm talking about you go
[1:03:40] down there and you lay that on that boy
[1:03:42] and that boy get well
[1:03:44] now notice
[1:03:46] that
[1:03:47] that rod that that that staff that was
[1:03:49] in his hand
[1:03:50] had the capabilities of healing that boy
[1:03:54] is that right
[1:03:55] it had the full capabilities because
[1:03:58] this
[1:03:59] was the gospel trumpet and when the
[1:04:01] gospel begins to sound it is a word of
[1:04:05] prophecy and because the god of heaven
[1:04:08] was behind elijah
[1:04:10] it would have been full capable to do
[1:04:13] what this woman's need was asking about
[1:04:16] but her faith was not in a stick
[1:04:21] her faith was in the man of god whom
[1:04:23] what she watched that power begin to
[1:04:26] pass through that humanity
[1:04:28] my faith is not in a man my faith is not
[1:04:31] in this pulpit my faith is not in this
[1:04:33] flesh my faith is in the man the son of
[1:04:37] man christ jesus
[1:04:44] thomas edison said i'm not discouraged
[1:04:48] because every wrong attempt discarded
[1:04:51] is a step
[1:04:52] forward when he finally created the
[1:04:55] light bulb
[1:04:58] so how do you feel
[1:05:00] about failing a thousand times he said i
[1:05:02] didn't fail a thousand times
[1:05:04] i figured out a thousand times how not
[1:05:06] to make a light bulb
[1:05:10] your mindset is huge
[1:05:13] how you take life
[1:05:15] but don't ever give in
[1:05:17] and don't ever give up
[1:05:20] you remember that guy gave up
[1:05:23] neither does no one else
[1:05:28] you remember the guy that gave up
[1:05:31] you remember who was the runner-up two
[1:05:32] or three years ago
[1:05:34] two to to the to the world series
[1:05:37] absolutely not you only remember the
[1:05:39] winners
[1:05:42] the greatest the greatest marathon in
[1:05:45] the olympics
[1:05:47] they don't care about who comes in last
[1:05:51] the person that comes in last does not
[1:05:53] get a chance to stand on the podium and
[1:05:55] hear their national anthem run out
[1:05:58] across across the city and across the
[1:06:01] stadium and when that man that is in
[1:06:04] first place comes running in
[1:06:06] there is a crowd that is cheering him on
[1:06:10] and though he may have went through some
[1:06:12] trials for 20 some miles just to get
[1:06:16] into the stadium when he got in the
[1:06:18] stadium when he got in there there were
[1:06:21] people that were shouting him on and no
[1:06:23] they wouldn't maybe not have been on the
[1:06:25] same nation they may not have been on
[1:06:27] the same team maybe not but yet there
[1:06:29] was a champion that was rolling into the
[1:06:32] stadium i want to say this morning the
[1:06:35] reason why you hear the shout of the
[1:06:38] king in the camp is because a champion
[1:06:40] come running in and he's telling you
[1:06:43] never give up never give in never back
[1:06:46] off
[1:06:48] [Applause]
[1:06:56] but too many people
[1:06:59] live life
[1:07:01] by haunted being haunted
[1:07:04] by missed opportunities
[1:07:08] has-beens
[1:07:10] couldn't hack it
[1:07:11] couldn't make it through life
[1:07:14] couldn't go all the way
[1:07:16] people live scarred
[1:07:18] haunted lives because they missed an
[1:07:20] opportunity
[1:07:21] when you go to study in a church age
[1:07:23] book you look in there and you talk you
[1:07:24] see brother branham bring up saying
[1:07:26] augustine of hippo that he almost
[1:07:29] received the holy ghost
[1:07:32] when you look into the bible and you see
[1:07:33] a man that was a rich young ruler that
[1:07:35] had everything
[1:07:38] but he couldn't completely sell out he
[1:07:39] was a man that was haunted by missed
[1:07:41] opportunities
[1:07:44] are you with me look at laodicea
[1:07:46] laodicea had the greatest message that's
[1:07:48] ever been preached upon the face of the
[1:07:51] earth and laodicea is haunted by missed
[1:07:54] opportunities when paul was standing
[1:07:56] before king agrippa he said i almost be
[1:08:00] persuaded by paul's speech and paul's
[1:08:03] testimony that this man that was once
[1:08:06] white one way is now another i'm almost
[1:08:09] persuaded
[1:08:11] haunted
[1:08:12] by a missed opportunity
[1:08:14] you think about all the people that walk
[1:08:16] in say oh i love that kind of preaching
[1:08:18] but they walk out
[1:08:22] i don't get excited when people tell me
[1:08:24] i'm gonna make you my home church i'll
[1:08:27] be back
[1:08:28] i'm not the one that has to deal with
[1:08:30] that
[1:08:31] they're the one that has to haunt be
[1:08:33] haunted by that
[1:08:35] be haunted in hell be gnashed on in hell
[1:08:38] because they missed an opportunity
[1:08:40] through the prince and the author of
[1:08:43] life but i am be one of them like paul
[1:08:46] said that i am persuaded that neither
[1:08:50] death nor life nor angels no
[1:08:52] principalities no hell no high water
[1:08:55] shall be able to separate me from the
[1:08:57] love of god
[1:09:00] with that kind of mindset you can walk
[1:09:02] through cancer with that kind of mindset
[1:09:04] you can walk through laodicea with that
[1:09:07] kind of mindset you can rise up in the
[1:09:09] morning
[1:09:11] i am persuaded
[1:09:13] [Applause]
[1:09:22] never give in
[1:09:25] and never give up
[1:09:28] when paul
[1:09:30] paul met the lord
[1:09:34] brother homer would say when
[1:09:36] when the devil met
[1:09:38] paul he met his match
[1:09:42] but paul was a man that was unwavered
[1:09:46] no matter what he shipwrecked
[1:09:49] beat
[1:09:51] put in prison bonds
[1:09:54] but paul would say in acts 20 and 24
[1:09:57] when he knew
[1:09:58] that the holy spirit was testifying to
[1:10:00] him through other brothers and sisters
[1:10:03] that were in the city when paul was
[1:10:04] making his
[1:10:06] his ascension of going into jerusalem
[1:10:09] paul said when he knew that he was going
[1:10:11] to get up there and he was going to go
[1:10:13] through chains and he was going to go
[1:10:14] through tribulations paul said in acts
[1:10:17] 20 and 24 he said none of these things
[1:10:19] move me
[1:10:22] none of these things move me everything
[1:10:25] that you see
[1:10:26] it doesn't move me it doesn't matter
[1:10:28] what i'm going through because i've got
[1:10:30] a goal that is ahead i'm not going for
[1:10:33] it that's one that beateth the air i'm
[1:10:35] going forth to win a prize
[1:10:38] i'm going forth and i'm going to press
[1:10:40] towards the mark of the high calling of
[1:10:43] him and our lord jesus christ
[1:10:47] now if this would have been
[1:10:49] just some lackadaisical ordinary person
[1:10:52] or a lesser man or a lesser woman they
[1:10:54] would have opted out for retirement by
[1:10:56] some beach over in hawaii or over by the
[1:10:58] coastal village basking in the serenity
[1:11:01] of the beautiful eastern sun but paul
[1:11:04] said i'm willing to go i'm willing to go
[1:11:07] to the chopper's block
[1:11:09] you see because paul was made out of not
[1:11:12] just some ordinary stuff that could be
[1:11:13] bluffed paul was made out of some
[1:11:15] thicker stuff
[1:11:17] and he would say none of these things
[1:11:19] moved me and he would say in ii
[1:11:21] corinthians 4 he would say tell ever
[1:11:23] tell us don't you lose heart
[1:11:27] don't you lose heart
[1:11:28] he said for which cause we faint not
[1:11:31] don't you lose heart but though our
[1:11:33] outward man perish yet the inward man is
[1:11:36] renewed day by day for our light
[1:11:38] affliction which is but for a moment
[1:11:41] worketh for us
[1:11:45] our light affliction
[1:11:50] paul would say i sought the lord thrice
[1:11:53] concerning this this thing
[1:12:00] but yet in my weakness
[1:12:04] he's made strong
[1:12:07] i sought the lord over this thing but
[1:12:09] my light affliction
[1:12:12] is working
[1:12:14] for a greater
[1:12:16] eternal glory
[1:12:22] never give in
[1:12:24] and never give up
[1:12:27] you go back to the very beginning when
[1:12:28] you go into the garden of eden and you
[1:12:30] can go there
[1:12:31] and you can see how the serpent began to
[1:12:33] slide underneath the garden walls and he
[1:12:36] began to talk
[1:12:38] began to talk to the hybrid
[1:12:40] and he began to talk to her and he began
[1:12:42] to because he was more subtle than any
[1:12:44] beast of the field he began to speak to
[1:12:46] her and he began to he began to whisper
[1:12:48] his tale and begin to tell her that god
[1:12:52] does not want you eating of the tree of
[1:12:55] knowledge of good and evil because he
[1:12:57] knows that when you eat of this tree it
[1:12:59] was not a fruit
[1:13:00] on the tree but it was a pear that were
[1:13:02] on the ground and he knew that if he
[1:13:05] could deceive her into believing his lie
[1:13:09] he said you shall not surely die what
[1:13:12] did she do she stopped to listen to his
[1:13:16] lie just like when you find over in
[1:13:19] revelations when the dragon deceived
[1:13:21] them by his tail not his tail but the
[1:13:24] tale that he told he deceived them and
[1:13:27] notice what eve did she stopped for just
[1:13:31] a moment and a man cannot sin until he
[1:13:34] first cast away the very word of god
[1:13:38] but you remember when nellie saunders
[1:13:40] when she was at when she when she come
[1:13:42] down there to the tabernacle she gave
[1:13:44] her life to the lord she stood there and
[1:13:46] said that that she gave her life to the
[1:13:48] lord and all these things and said she'd
[1:13:50] never go back to the world and she'd
[1:13:52] come back in the church and it would she
[1:13:54] would say these things said you know i
[1:13:56] look at hope i look at your wife i look
[1:13:58] at i look at these other young sisters
[1:14:00] and they look so young they look so
[1:14:02] beautiful but here i am
[1:14:05] marred up
[1:14:06] i i look rough i look rough all over
[1:14:09] because sin has a way of marking you
[1:14:14] but you remember how that she had her
[1:14:16] testimony that she gave her life to the
[1:14:18] lord and she was a famous dancer there
[1:14:21] with in the city with lee horn and they
[1:14:22] won all those championships and all
[1:14:25] those dancing championships doing the uh
[1:14:27] doing doing all kinds of dances and she
[1:14:30] was going down the street and she was
[1:14:31] making going to get some stuff to make a
[1:14:34] dress and you remember a story she was
[1:14:36] going to make some dresses and she was
[1:14:38] walking down through there coming down
[1:14:40] spring street and when she come down
[1:14:42] through there she heard that music up
[1:14:44] there at redmond's hall she heard those
[1:14:46] things
[1:14:48] and she said i just stopped for a moment
[1:14:51] and she said oh i begin to remember all
[1:14:53] of those things and then the thought
[1:14:55] comes in my mind maybe i'll go up there
[1:14:57] and i'll just testify to him about the
[1:14:59] grace of the lord jesus christ
[1:15:02] how the enemy wants to trap you into
[1:15:04] thinking that you have power
[1:15:06] over him
[1:15:08] it's not you that has power but it's
[1:15:10] your father that dwelleth in you that
[1:15:11] has the power and when she came to
[1:15:14] herself she found herself in another
[1:15:17] man's arms
[1:15:19] and she'd come running that night and
[1:15:21] said bill i'm lost i'm gone i'm gone
[1:15:27] what was it brother madam would say in
[1:15:28] one spot
[1:15:29] he said a habit
[1:15:31] is simply
[1:15:32] an unclean spirit
[1:15:35] and you think well you know it ain't
[1:15:37] really hurting me
[1:15:39] this little this little thing that i
[1:15:40] carry in my pocket or this little bit of
[1:15:42] tobacco or this a little bit just a
[1:15:44] little bit of wine won't hurt me just
[1:15:46] just a little bit eleven
[1:15:48] eleven's a whole lot
[1:15:50] see you just just a little bit it's an
[1:15:52] unclean spirit
[1:15:54] yeah it's an unclean spirit and a and
[1:15:58] and brother branham would was dealing
[1:16:00] with a patient one time and said now now
[1:16:02] i see
[1:16:03] you've got that little habit that little
[1:16:05] habit that you got in your life and it's
[1:16:07] it's tobacco and you're trying with
[1:16:10] everything that's within you to get rid
[1:16:12] of it he said what that is is an unclean
[1:16:16] devil
[1:16:19] and people don't realize what they're
[1:16:21] handling
[1:16:24] you see brother branham would say in one
[1:16:25] spot he said the devil only wants you to
[1:16:27] try one time
[1:16:30] he only wants you to go up there to that
[1:16:32] spot just one time and then he's got you
[1:16:34] he wants you to smoke one cigarette one
[1:16:37] time listen to rock and roll one time
[1:16:41] because there are enticing spirits that
[1:16:44] are moving through the land and people
[1:16:47] think that the devil's some some
[1:16:48] imaginary thing that's got a guy got a
[1:16:51] pitchfork in his hand and got a tail and
[1:16:53] got horns coming off of his head he's
[1:16:55] not that way
[1:16:56] he's deceitful he's a slicker he's wise
[1:16:59] he's smart he's been studying your dna
[1:17:02] for all of these years and to think that
[1:17:04] he's been studying your family history
[1:17:07] for 6 000 years and he thinks he's going
[1:17:10] to win against you you think that satan
[1:17:13] has tried to come and have a marvelous
[1:17:16] success he had a marvelous success when
[1:17:19] he went in there and brother madam said
[1:17:20] in satan's eden he said he had a
[1:17:22] marvelous success by coming in and
[1:17:25] poisoning the mind of noah's people and
[1:17:27] telling them that there was no rain up
[1:17:29] there he certainly had a marvelous
[1:17:31] success when he went down there and he
[1:17:34] tried to control eve and made her fall
[1:17:36] by deception
[1:17:38] all of this work you think about satan
[1:17:41] you think about him as a king you think
[1:17:43] about him as a king he's a liar he's a
[1:17:46] cheater you think about his kingdom the
[1:17:49] only way he has a kingdom is if you let
[1:17:50] him reign in your heart
[1:17:55] you think about this 6 000 years of work
[1:17:58] for a three and a half year reign
[1:18:03] three and a half year reign
[1:18:05] six thousand years of work
[1:18:07] he's doing his absolute best to make you
[1:18:10] give up
[1:18:11] he's trying his best through the
[1:18:12] laodicean spirit to make you give in
[1:18:16] to make you fold the cards as it were
[1:18:18] and said i can't go no more
[1:18:22] when you think you can't go no more
[1:18:24] you're only 30 percent
[1:18:28] that's talking about the flesh when a
[1:18:30] person gets in their mind when they're
[1:18:33] in a battle or they're in some kind of
[1:18:35] exercise or some kind of strategy when
[1:18:38] they think they can't go no more they're
[1:18:40] only at 30 percent
[1:18:44] and when you get to your wit's end as a
[1:18:47] christian
[1:18:48] keep it in your mind you're not even
[1:18:51] halfway done with your life
[1:18:54] what lays before you is eternity you
[1:18:57] have got the goods to make it all the
[1:18:59] way through don't you ever give him and
[1:19:02] don't you ever give up
[1:19:06] but i
[1:19:07] brother andrew
[1:19:09] i fell
[1:19:10] the bible says in proverbs 24 and 16
[1:19:13] that a just man falls seven times but he
[1:19:16] gets back up

[1:19:23] mindset i can't go on you're only

[1:21:20] your usual church
[1:21:22] remember i ain't preaching to you i'm
[1:21:24] just talking to you this morning
[1:21:26] this ain't a social club this ain't the
[1:21:28] lodge where you can go down and you can
[1:21:30] smoke your booze and live any way you
[1:21:32] want to smoke your boots my word that's
[1:21:34] some kind of new thing they're doing
[1:21:35] nowadays they're coming up all kinds of
[1:21:37] stuff
[1:21:38] [Applause]
[1:21:40] this ain't a lodge this ain't a club
[1:21:43] but what this is is a kingdom that
[1:21:44] cannot be shook
[1:21:46] this is the children of the most high
[1:21:48] god that we have learned by now that we
[1:21:52] have come through some stuff we have
[1:21:54] been through life we have been through
[1:21:56] trials but every trial only made us
[1:21:59] stronger every battle we kept on winning
[1:22:01] it looked like we was going down but
[1:22:03] there was somebody that kept raising a
[1:22:06] standard
[1:22:10] the army
[1:22:11] when they see when they're in the middle
[1:22:12] of a war they're watching that standard
[1:22:15] to see where that flag's at and that
[1:22:17] flag is showing them where they've got
[1:22:19] to go to battle at and the bible said
[1:22:22] that when the enemy comes in like a
[1:22:24] flood the spirit of the lord shall raise
[1:22:26] up a standard
[1:22:39] you're facing an enemy
[1:22:42] he don't want to just make you sick
[1:22:45] he wants to kill you
[1:22:48] and he tries to offer you
[1:22:50] peace
[1:22:52] but peace with the devil's fake peace
[1:22:55] live and let live will not work with an
[1:22:57] enemy that only survives by your
[1:22:59] destruction
[1:23:15] never give in
[1:23:18] and never give up
[1:23:27] william borland would have never been in
[1:23:28] this church
[1:23:33] gabriel spencer would have never been in
[1:23:34] this church
[1:23:36] jim noel would have never been in this
[1:23:38] church
[1:23:40] melissa hill would have never been in
[1:23:41] this church
[1:23:43] if we would listen to our naysayers
[1:23:45] if we were to listen to the people say
[1:23:47] you shouldn't go
[1:23:48] if we should if we listen to the people
[1:23:50] say you know what
[1:23:52] you know what you you're too far gone
[1:23:55] you know what you you send your day of
[1:23:57] grace away
[1:23:58] when
[1:24:00] the winners start listening to quitters
[1:24:04] [Applause]
[1:24:17] never give him
[1:24:18] never give up
[1:24:20] the devil wants your land he wants your
[1:24:23] property he wants your family he wants
[1:24:26] your joy we're not going to be pushed
[1:24:28] back on the ropes we're not gonna be
[1:24:30] back into a corner we're gonna win
[1:24:36] a quitter always quits and a winner
[1:24:38] learns how to win every time
[1:24:43] never give up never give in
[1:24:45] [Applause]
[1:24:54] the enemy is an assassin that's trying
[1:24:56] to kill you from long range
[1:24:59] but how he works he comes in real close
[1:25:04] he's got a plan all the way back there
[1:25:05] and he comes in real close so that you
[1:25:07] don't realize that you're getting shot
[1:25:09] at from your surroundings
[1:25:12] he's good at his job
[1:25:16] notice
[1:25:17] i'm gonna go to some scriptures here
[1:25:21] follow me in first samuel eleven
[1:25:25] i think we'll be much longer
[1:25:29] then in nahash the ammonite came came up
[1:25:31] and encamped against javascript and all
[1:25:34] the men of j bassin said unto nahash
[1:25:37] make a covenant with us
[1:25:38] and we will serve thee
[1:25:40] and they has the ammonite answered them
[1:25:43] on this condition will i make a covenant
[1:25:45] with you that i may
[1:25:46] thrust out all of your right eyes
[1:25:50] and lay it for a reproach upon all of
[1:25:52] israel
[1:25:53] and the elders of jabash said unto him
[1:25:55] that give us seven days
[1:25:57] respite that we may send messengers unto
[1:25:59] the coast of israel then
[1:26:03] if there be no man to save us we will
[1:26:05] come out to thee
[1:26:07] now the ammonites had long claimed
[1:26:10] the right of the original possession
[1:26:13] of gilead
[1:26:15] and even though that that they had been
[1:26:17] crushed through through through jephthah
[1:26:20] over in the book of judges they now
[1:26:23] after these some 90 years were coming
[1:26:25] back to renew their claim on what they
[1:26:28] had made a possession for their own
[1:26:31] and nahash the ammonite if you go to
[1:26:33] studying it out it means serpent
[1:26:36] that he comes in and he begins to make a
[1:26:39] deal with them
[1:26:41] to make them give up what is rightfully
[1:26:43] theirs to make them give in and he made
[1:26:46] them a proposal and said now now now you
[1:26:50] just come if you if you if you want to
[1:26:52] give in if you want to if you want to do
[1:26:53] this you let me just thrust out or bore
[1:26:56] through your right eye out of all of the
[1:26:58] men of jabash gilead
[1:27:01] and he gave them a week to appeal to all
[1:27:03] of israel for help after that and they
[1:27:07] if they could not come back with a
[1:27:08] resolution they were to surrender unto
[1:27:11] him
[1:27:12] but notice what he was saying unto them
[1:27:14] he's wanting them to give up their
[1:27:16] rights of seeing
[1:27:19] he's basically saying i'm wanting you to
[1:27:22] give up your profit
[1:27:24] i'm wanting you to give up your ability
[1:27:26] to look out and to fight but not only is
[1:27:29] he saying that i'm gonna take your land
[1:27:31] but let me bring an insult against all
[1:27:35] of israel that this was the generation
[1:27:40] could you imagine the generation that
[1:27:42] would walk around maybe some 40 years
[1:27:45] after this if it would have happened
[1:27:47] what's wrong with those people all of
[1:27:49] those eyes all of their right eyes are
[1:27:51] thrust out or bored out
[1:27:54] this
[1:27:56] would be a mocking
[1:27:58] and a mockery to all the children of
[1:28:00] israel that this was the generation
[1:28:04] that gave up our land
[1:28:06] this is the generation that listened to
[1:28:10] the enemy
[1:28:11] and you see a soldier without his eyes
[1:28:14] is absolutely useless
[1:28:21] you can hold your sword all you want to
[1:28:22] but if you can't see where you're
[1:28:23] swinging it
[1:28:26] you see that's what he's tried to do in
[1:28:28] this day come in with the lust of the
[1:28:30] flesh and the pride of life and the lust
[1:28:32] of the eyes and come in and rob you and
[1:28:35] do all of these things unto you now
[1:28:37] notice notices of this quote he said now
[1:28:40] he said if the man by his intellect will
[1:28:42] finally grieve the holy spirit and keep
[1:28:44] saying the holy spirit keeps saying you
[1:28:46] should and he said well i'm too young i
[1:28:48] belong to church but you shouldn't be
[1:28:50] born again but you should be born again
[1:28:52] well if i get that kind of experience i
[1:28:54] won't be able to do this or do that or i
[1:28:57] can't go to this or that well you see
[1:28:59] the devil will tell you that you're
[1:29:01] going to lose some good time you're
[1:29:03] going to lose some privileges
[1:29:05] but he's lying to you
[1:29:07] especially use young people i'll go do a
[1:29:09] study throughout the message on he's
[1:29:10] lying to you it'll bless you
[1:29:12] oh my you don't have to drink you don't
[1:29:14] have to smoke you don't have to run
[1:29:16] around in these places of amusement
[1:29:18] why the holy spirit is a million times
[1:29:20] better than all the devils could even
[1:29:22] offer you why you don't have to get
[1:29:24] drunk on strong drink to have a big time
[1:29:26] sinners do that but you don't have to do
[1:29:28] that because i've been 23 years
[1:29:30] preaching and i've been drunk the whole
[1:29:32] 23 years on the holy spirit it's a
[1:29:34] stimulation itself it's never lets up
[1:29:36] i've always got joy i always got peace
[1:29:39] always feel good the lord is here if i'm
[1:29:42] sick and body he's got me happy in my
[1:29:44] soul if things are going good things are
[1:29:46] going good in my soul and by bad in my
[1:29:49] body or vice versa it makes any
[1:29:51] difference god is always there and i'm
[1:29:55] always stimulated with a pleasure that
[1:29:57] joy is unspeakable and full of glory
[1:30:00] that's what he does
[1:30:02] for the believer
[1:30:05] it doesn't matter
[1:30:06] what you're going through throughout
[1:30:08] your situation of life
[1:30:11] i've had friends throughout my life
[1:30:12] throughout my christian life that need
[1:30:14] me to be by their side to keep their
[1:30:16] christianity
[1:30:19] but if i would go away for some time
[1:30:22] they would lose their christianity but
[1:30:24] the holy spirit is a keeper he's a
[1:30:27] sealer he's a protector he is the one
[1:30:30] that i keep you
[1:30:33] he's the keeper
[1:30:36] [Music]
[1:30:38] verse four
[1:30:40] and then came the messenger of gibeah to
[1:30:41] of saul and told the tidings in the ears

[1:31:51] came upon saul and he got angry

[1:31:55] when the enemy is wanting you to give in
[1:31:58] and want you to give up that you're
[1:32:00] going to have to allow a righteous
[1:32:02] indignation to rise up on the inside of

[1:32:10] the oxen of the land and he cune them

[1:45:46] your eyes of seeing
[1:45:49] but may the spirit of the lord come and
[1:45:51] anoint your eyes
[1:45:53] with the isaf of the holy spirit
[1:46:03] father
[1:46:10] where's your children
[1:46:20] where your children lord
[1:46:26] life's thrown us some big
[1:46:28] some big loops
[1:46:30] come slapped us up and hit us upside the
[1:46:33] wall many times
[1:46:35] threw us some
[1:46:38] curveballs and try to knock us out the
[1:46:41] race
[1:46:43] but our testimony remains the same
[1:46:48] that if god be for me
[1:46:51] who can be against me
[1:46:54] the weapons of life
[1:46:57] surely they were formed against us
[1:47:02] things that may be
[1:47:03] hereditary that would be passed down
[1:47:07] circumstances through dna lines
[1:47:13] but when i look into your eyes lord
[1:47:19] i can't see a circumstance
[1:47:23] i can't see a fault
[1:47:26] and i can't see a failure
[1:47:30] lord what i see
[1:47:32] is not humanity
[1:47:34] but divinity
[1:47:42] but may we be the one
[1:47:46] like simon of serene
[1:47:50] willing to get up underneath the load of
[1:47:53] this gospel
[1:47:55] and carry this sure word of prophecy
[1:48:00] oh sure
[1:48:02] might just be housewives maybe
[1:48:05] lives and we don't know
[1:48:10] we didn't plan out life the way it is we
[1:48:11] didn't
[1:48:13] we didn't expect to wake up every
[1:48:14] morning to crying babies
[1:48:17] we didn't expect to wake up with twins
[1:48:19] in the house and
[1:48:21] and life just kind of had chaos
[1:48:24] we didn't mean to we didn't expect our
[1:48:27] life to throw things like that it's like
[1:48:29] yes
[1:48:31] lord
[1:48:33] we commit our lives to you
[1:48:36] we'll commit every situation
[1:48:39] or commit every habit
[1:48:42] because when we get underneath that
[1:48:44] cross
[1:48:48] always see is you
[1:48:53] as david would say
[1:48:55] i have set the lord always before me
[1:48:58] that i might not sin against him

[1:49:41] us
