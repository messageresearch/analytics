[44:14] bless his word he may be seated today in
[44:16] the presence of the Lord we'd like to
[44:18] speak to you today on a thought that the
[44:20] Lord's put on our heart for this
[44:21] morning's service on the Cry The Cry for
[44:25] Help The Cry for Help and the Bible says
[44:28] here in Exodus chapter 2 and 23 that it
[44:30] came to pass that in the process of time
[44:33] that the king of Egypt died and the
[44:36] children of Israel sighed by reason of
[44:38] the bondage and they cried and their Cry
[44:41] came up unto God by the reason of the
[44:44] bondage and God heard their groaning and
[44:47] God remembered his Covenant with Abraham
[44:49] with Isaac and with Jacob and God looked
[44:52] upon the children of Israel and God had
[44:54] respect unto them Exodus 3 and 1 says
[44:57] now Moses had kept the flock of Jethro
[44:59] his father-in-law the priest of Midian
[45:02] and he led the flock to the backside of
[45:04] the desert and came to the Mountain of
[45:05] God even to up and the angel of
[45:08] the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of
[45:10] fire out of the midst of a bush and he
[45:12] looked and behold the bush burned with
[45:15] fire and the Bush was not consumed and
[45:17] Moses said I will now turn aside and see
[45:20] this great sight why the bush is not
[45:23] burnt and when the Lord saw that he
[45:25] turned aside to see God called unto him
[45:27] out of the midst of the Bush and said
[45:31] Moses Moses and he said here am I and he
[45:34] said draw not nigh hi hither put off thy
[45:36] shoes from off thy feet for the place
[45:38] where on thou stand this is Holy Ground
[45:41] moreover he said I am the god of thy
[45:43] father the god of Abraham the god of
[45:45] Isaac the god of Jacob and Moses hid his
[45:48] face for he was afraid to look upon God
[45:50] and the Lord said I have surely seen the
[45:54] Affliction of my people which are in
[45:56] Egypt and I have heard their Cry by
[45:59] reason for of their task Masters for I
[46:02] know their sorrows and I am come down to
[46:04] deliver them out of the hand of the
[46:06] Egyptians and to bring them up out of
[46:08] that land unto a good land and a large
[46:11] and unto a land flowing with milk and
[46:13] honey under the place of the Canaanites
[46:15] the Hittites the amorites the parisites
[46:18] and the hivites and the jebusites now
[46:20] therefore Behold The Cry of the children
[46:23] of Israel is come unto me and it's a
[46:26] powerful thing when God says I have
[46:28] heard your cry it doesn't matter where
[46:31] you are these people were in the midst
[46:33] of captivity but God heard their cry
[46:36] there were a million other voices that
[46:38] were crying out in Egypt but God heard
[46:41] the be the specific Cry of his people
[46:44] you see there's something about a mother
[46:47] that that knows the very the very Cry of
[46:50] her child there is something about her
[46:52] that is something that is that is placed
[46:54] on the inside of her it could be in the
[46:56] midst of a other thousand other babies
[46:58] crying but that mother has an instinct
[47:01] that is put on the inside of her that
[47:03] she hears the Cry of her child and she
[47:07] knows she knows when she is when when
[47:09] that child is crying out for help and we
[47:12] realize that we are serving a God that
[47:14] understands everything that each of us
[47:16] go through we're serving a god that is a
[47:19] very caring God he's a god of judgment
[47:21] but yet he's a god of Mercy as well and
[47:23] we serve a God that understands all
[47:25] things before we ever get into the midst
[47:27] of our troubles or the the midst of our
[47:29] calamities we serve of God that is
[47:32] omnipotent that means that he is
[47:33] all-powerful and we serve a god that is
[47:36] omniscient that he knows all things and
[47:38] he sees all things and him being
[47:40] omniscient makes him omnipresent so that
[47:43] we recognize that we cannot go anywhere
[47:45] or do anything without the omniscience
[47:48] of God that has already seen or heard or
[47:51] understands what we are getting ready to
[47:53] go through and we are serving a god that
[47:55] is said that I will never leave you and
[47:57] I will never forsake you we are serving
[48:00] a God that his eyes do not fall and
[48:02] Slumber and his eyes do not fall asleep
[48:04] his eyes run to and fro throughout all
[48:07] the Earth it doesn't matter if it's the
[48:09] president that needs help it doesn't
[48:11] matter if it's the Pauper that needs
[48:12] help he's the god that hears the Cry of
[48:15] his children and if he met the three who
[48:17] brewed children in the midst of a fire
[48:19] he can meet you in the midst of your
[48:21] Calamity or in the midst of your crisis
[48:24] he didn't send an angel down but he came
[48:26] down himself he didn't send down just a
[48:28] it's a weaker Angel but the mighty Angel
[48:30] Michael himself showed up and I want you
[48:33] to know that the god that you're serving
[48:35] today is not a weak God he said God that
[48:39] understands the Cry of his people and
[48:42] even though you might be in a spot where
[48:44] you think well I don't necessarily I
[48:46] don't feel like I'm crying out for help
[48:47] but there is something about our God
[48:49] that understands our future
[48:52] he understands what we're getting ready
[48:55] to go through so he allows us to have a
[48:57] word for a season that we're in so that
[49:00] even though we may not be in a spot of
[49:02] crying right now things might look like
[49:04] they're in a good spot because we're
[49:06] still under the rulership of Joseph but
[49:09] there's coming a time in our future so
[49:11] God has got to deliver all the way out
[49:13] there in our future isn't it wonderful
[49:15] to know that tonight that even when
[49:17] Israel was a limping Prince and he was
[49:19] blind that he had a son that was set up
[49:22] there that had that had somebody that
[49:24] had passed down through his genealogy
[49:26] that was going to take care of them and
[49:28] a man go all the way into a prison cell
[49:30] get sold out get sold out by his
[49:33] brothers be sold out and that men would
[49:35] ridicule him his brothers made fun of
[49:37] him but he was Rose to the second in
[49:40] command in all of Egypt why was this
[49:42] done was because there was a famine that
[49:45] was coming and God was going to take
[49:47] care of his children you see before
[49:49] Joseph ever got in there and he was ever
[49:52] in second man God had a vision that
[49:54] Joseph was going to be there and before
[49:57] you ever got in your condition God had a
[49:59] Prophet come to this land and deliver a
[50:02] word that would get out before you ever
[50:04] got here the god of the Bible is in your
[50:06] future today and before you got in your
[50:09] troubles or before you ever got in this
[50:11] chaos of needing a word that would get
[50:13] you out of the situation that you're in
[50:15] he had a prophetic Ministry deliver a
[50:18] word that has the power to deliver
[50:21] now notice what brother made him says
[50:23] here in the power of God he said Satan's
[50:25] power is limited Faith's power brings
[50:28] the past God's revealed Revelation he
[50:30] said but God helps those who cannot act
[50:33] and help themselves that us that old
[50:36] dishonoring God dishonoring God proverb
[50:38] but said God helps those who helps
[50:41] himself he said how ridiculous God helps
[50:43] those who can't help themselves say Amen
[50:46] isn't he wonderful the power of God what
[50:48] does it the power of God is the only
[50:51] thing that can give eternal life the
[50:53] power of God is the only thing it's the
[50:55] power of God that built a tree all the
[50:57] science in the world can't build a tree
[50:59] God's power built the tree God's power
[51:02] keeps me alive if God calls for you all
[51:05] the hospital and the oxygen tents and
[51:07] the pool motors in the world couldn't
[51:08] keep you here salvation is of the lord
[51:11] it's God it's God's power that feeds the
[51:14] sparrow it's God's power that speaks to
[51:16] the little duck up yonder there is
[51:18] nobody that goes up there and chews him
[51:20] off the lake in Canada and so get go
[51:22] down to Louisiana no sir it's the power
[51:25] that sues him off of that Lake the
[51:27] little fella don't know which way to go
[51:29] but it's God's power that directs him to
[51:31] the South it's God's power that directs
[51:33] them to Jesus Christ it's God's power
[51:35] that brought the wise men to the Cradle
[51:37] it's got power that Thrills the soul of
[51:40] every believer it's God's power to help
[51:42] those who cannot help themself when
[51:45] Lazarus was in his worst of conditions
[51:48] when he was past anybody's worst
[51:50] conditions that are setting here today
[51:52] when he was in a spot when he needed
[51:54] somebody that was bigger than him Jesus
[51:57] showed up late
[51:58] you know you are serving a God that
[52:01] knows how to show up late to a party and
[52:03] still make it the greatest come out
[52:05] you're servant of God that it might look
[52:08] like he isn't coming but there's a God
[52:10] that's in your future he knows how to
[52:12] sew a plate
[52:14] Lazarus his name means without help and
[52:17] Lazarus was within a spot that he needed
[52:20] somebody bigger than him to help him out
[52:22] of his condition Jonah needed somebody
[52:24] to get him out of a belly's well of the
[52:27] will of the belly or the Hallelujah
[52:29] always get that mixed up out of the well
[52:31] out of the wells belly he needed
[52:34] somebody that would get him out of it
[52:35] but there was a God that had a prophecy
[52:38] that it was not going to go down there
[52:40] in destruction but he had a god
[52:42] that knew how to took a whale and put
[52:45] him over there and then of a and deliver
[52:46] the message and God knows how to get you
[52:49] out of the situation of life that you're
[52:52] in God's got a prophetic Ministry
[52:55] that it's in operation in the Church of
[52:57] the Living God you say well the
[52:59] prophet's done gone I'll say this that
[53:01] William Branham said that the real
[53:03] Prophet is the Holy Spirit and the Holy
[53:06] Spirit is the one that can get you out
[53:08] of your situation
[53:11] you ever had a nightmare that you can't
[53:14] shake and you wake up in the morning and

[53:25] mind up you can't hardly go to sleep
[53:27] because you need help to get out of it
[53:31] because Satan knows how to attack you in
[53:33] your night Seasons they are in your
[53:35] subconscious when you are not active
[53:37] enough to be able to take the word of
[53:40] God and defeat him so he comes to you in
[53:43] your night seasons and he gives you
[53:45] nightmares
[53:47] but you I want to turn this around that
[53:50] you are Satan's worst nightmare

[53:56] Satan hates your power Satan hates your
[53:59] Authority Satan hate your praise Satan
[54:01] hates your hallelujahs Satan hates your
[54:04] amen because he knows that if you ever
[54:07] wake up from that moment and you begin
[54:09] to turn around and curse the very devil
[54:12] that his anointed your nightmares
[54:15] he is without help there's a God that'll
[54:18] show up for you but there's nobody
[54:20] that'll back up Satan

[54:32] brother Timmy you got somebody that'll
[54:34] show up for you when you need him worse
[54:37] than you ever thought but Satan has no
[54:39] backup
[54:42] [Applause]
[54:44] Hallelujah
[54:47] David said in Psalms 18 and 6 in my
[54:49] distress I called upon the Lord and
[54:52] Cried unto my God and he heard my voice
[54:54] out of his Temple and My Cry came before
[54:56] him even unto his ears you see David
[55:00] found him in the midst of his deep
[55:03] distress and danger that he called upon
[55:05] God and he found God ready to help
[55:10] Psalms 34 and 15 the eyes of the Lord
[55:13] are upon the righteous and his ears are
[55:16] upon their cry Psalms 139 and 4 for
[55:19] there is not a word in my tongue but Lo
[55:21] O Lord thou knowest it all together thou
[55:24] has to be sent me behind and before and
[55:25] laid thy hand upon me such a knowledge
[55:28] is too wonderful for me it is high and I
[55:31] cannot attain it wither shall I go from
[55:33] thy Spirit or wither shall I flee from
[55:36] thy presence if I Ascend into the
[55:38] heavens Thou Art there if I make my bed
[55:41] in hell behold Thou Art they are if I
[55:43] take the wings of the morning and dwell
[55:45] in the other most parts of the sea even
[55:48] there
[55:49] even there shall I hand Lead Me thy
[55:53] right hand shall hold me I want you to
[55:55] know there is nowhere that you can go
[55:57] that you can escape the very hand of
[55:59] almighty God if you are his children

[56:04] no demon there's no sickness that can
[56:06] pluck you out of the hand of the father
[56:08] if you go to hell he's already there if
[56:12] you go to heaven he's here if you're in
[56:14] laodicea he's there
[56:18] Psalms 107 and 6 then they Cried unto
[56:21] the Lord in their trouble
[56:23] and he left them all alone
[56:26] he left them and he made them wonder if
[56:29] he was still God or not
[56:32] he delivered them
[56:34] out of their distresses
[56:39] oh brother Bosworth he said that the
[56:42] baby that cries aloud is he gets the
[56:45] most attention
[56:46] so sometimes you just gotta cry
[56:49] grown men cry
[56:54] it ain't just little weak Christians
[56:56] it's him strong Christians that knows
[56:59] the power and crying out to God
[57:01] a real man knows how to call on God a
[57:04] real man is not ashamed to say Lord I

[57:08] myself out of it a real man is not
[57:11] ashamed a real woman is not ashamed to
[57:13] say the problem that I am in I need
[57:16] somebody that's bigger than me to get me
[57:18] out of the chaos that I got myself into
[57:20] I can tell you I dug myself a whole lot
[57:22] of holes in life but there was one that
[57:24] was always willing to pick me up out of
[57:26] it that was one when I was sick he was
[57:29] ready to heal me when I was lost he was
[57:31] ready to save me when I was bound he was
[57:33] ready to deliver me I failed him to be a
[57:36] just God and a holy God and a powerful
[57:39] God
[57:40] he's ready this morning
[57:43] Hallelujah
[57:46] Hallelujah
[57:49] [Applause]
[57:54] being a parent
[57:56] being a parent it is one of the most
[57:58] difficult things that's having a little
[58:00] baby
[58:03] they don't know how to speak and don't
[58:04] know how to talk
[58:07] and when they're crying out for help you
[58:09] don't know what to do you try to change
[58:10] your diaper you try to give them a
[58:12] bottle you try to feed him try to burp
[58:13] them you try to you try to soothe their
[58:15] soul you try to
[58:17] and all you can do is hug them
[58:20] and sometimes a hug is all that you need
[58:25] you ever gotten a spot where man I just
[58:27] needed a big hug from God
[58:32] I've been there too
[58:35] I want you to know I have found him that
[58:37] he knows how to caress his children
[58:40] but you know that feeling as a mother or
[58:42] a father that you don't know how to wake
[58:44] when they wake up in the middle of the
[58:46] night it's 2 30 in the morning then
[58:47] they're crying and you don't know why
[58:49] whether they had a nightmare whether
[58:50] they're crying for the hungry or whether
[58:52] they're crying for this that or the
[58:53] other you don't know what's going on and
[58:55] you can't imagine that feeling if you
[58:58] never had a child you don't understand
[58:59] because it's a part of you but if you if
[59:01] you have had a child you understand what
[59:03] I'm saying about is because it wakes you
[59:05] up in the middle of the night it tears
[59:06] your nerves up because you can't help
[59:08] them and you feel helpless you want to
[59:10] do everything for them they're so young
[59:12] they need your help and you just you
[59:14] just want to do it for them you're there
[59:16] in that spot and you can't help them and
[59:19] they're crying out for it but all you
[59:21] can do is just be their mother and you
[59:24] might get in the spot and you think my
[59:25] goodness I I feel like I let God raised
[59:28] the wrong person up to raise this child
[59:30] you're the best person
[59:32] you're the best person that God could
[59:35] have chose to raise that little
[59:37] individual it's because they are a part
[59:39] of you
[59:41] they are a part of you and you deposited
[59:44] all that you are on the inside of them
[59:46] and you know how to take care of them
[59:48] you might feel hopeless and you might
[59:50] feel helpless but you're the one that
[59:53] God has chosen to take care of
[59:55] oh you might feel that way but Papa God
[59:59] is right there waiting for you to listen
[1:00:02] Hallelujah he's waiting for you to call
[1:00:05] on him father God my little girl my
[1:00:08] little boy is in this condition and I
[1:00:10] can't help them out but father I know
[1:00:12] that you're willing
[1:00:17] Hallelujah you're not sitting here
[1:00:19] helpless today you're not sitting here
[1:00:21] hopeless today that's a God that
[1:00:23] understands the reason of your cry
[1:00:25] there's a God that understands why
[1:00:27] you're asking why you're asking
[1:00:29] Hallelujah
[1:00:31] Hallelujah
[1:00:33] he's a God that sees
[1:00:36] he's a God that hears
[1:00:39] Hallelujah he's a God that understands
[1:00:45] the very first time we ever see Angels
[1:00:48] appearing in the Bible as they appear to
[1:00:50] Hagar
[1:00:51] when God comes when God comes down and
[1:00:57] Hagar when God when Abraham is
[1:00:59] protecting Isaac and he pushes out
[1:01:01] Ishmael and Hagar and he sends them out
[1:01:04] there with a bottle and they go out
[1:01:05] there and they're all alone and
[1:01:07] she's out there crying because she knows
[1:01:09] she can't take care of him the bottles
[1:01:11] done ran empty and she can't take care
[1:01:12] of him so she goes over there and sets
[1:01:14] him underneath of a bush she puts him
[1:01:16] underneath the bush and she goes over
[1:01:17] there about the distance of a bear Arrow
[1:01:19] a shot of an arrow and she goes away so
[1:01:22] that she can't hear her baby crying but
[1:01:24] there was an angel the Lord had appeared
[1:01:26] unto her and said what is this cry that
[1:01:28] has came unto me and he came there and
[1:01:31] there appeared a whale over there a
[1:01:34] whale appeared for Hagar and if God
[1:01:37] heard the hair if he heard the Cry Of
[1:01:40] The Ponds woman how much more shall he
[1:01:42] hear the Cry of the free woman
[1:01:45] you recognize who you are today you're
[1:01:47] not a child of the bonds woman you're
[1:01:49] not a child of the slave you're the
[1:01:51] child of the most high God you're not
[1:01:54] wearing him out by asking him over and
[1:01:57] over again he's thanking you you're
[1:01:59] giving him the opportunity for the
[1:02:02] pillar of fire to show up
[1:02:06] well so I'm getting tired of asking God
[1:02:08] ain't tired of giving God ain't tired of
[1:02:10] listening God ain't tired of you calling
[1:02:13] out to him that's what he built you for
[1:02:15] it's so that you could call out to him
[1:02:19] if he didn't need the Savior he'd have
[1:02:22] never became a savior if he didn't need
[1:02:24] to hear you he'd have never put ears
[1:02:25] upon his upon his body but he's got to
[1:02:28] hear his children
[1:02:33] why did he let me get in this condition
[1:02:36] Joe and display his power
[1:02:40] you wouldn't understand what it's like
[1:02:42] to know him as a God that saves unless
[1:02:45] you got in the condition that you're in
[1:02:48] Hallelujah that's a lot of people that
[1:02:50] don't understand him as a God that saves
[1:02:52] her a God that delivers because they
[1:02:53] never experienced him but to you that
[1:02:55] have known him
[1:02:57] you can stand here as a witness of the
[1:03:00] power of the Holy Ghost
[1:03:02] surely surely if he was up there and he
[1:03:06] had a man up there on the moon on the
[1:03:07] backside of a desert by the name of
[1:03:09] Moses
[1:03:10] that was going to have a conference with
[1:03:13] him and he was going to talk to him
[1:03:15] about these two million Israelites that
[1:03:17] are down there and they're in captivity
[1:03:19] surely he's got a god surely he's got
[1:03:21] somebody that's going to hear
[1:03:24] you see this conference that it was
[1:03:25] taking place upon that mountain was in
[1:03:27] direct line of a conference that took
[1:03:30] place as Genesis chapter 15 that thy
[1:03:33] seed is going to sojourn in a Strange
[1:03:35] Land you see God had promised that his
[1:03:37] seed was going to sojourn there but he
[1:03:39] was awaiting for a time where the
[1:03:41] deliverer would come and because of
[1:03:44] Moses's intellectual ideas he calls the
[1:03:47] children of Israel 40 more years and he
[1:03:49] was back there on the backside of the
[1:03:50] day of sir and he was finding out what
[1:03:52] God really meant for his life
[1:03:54] you see Moses was born for this purpose
[1:03:57] his mama told him about it his mama told
[1:03:59] him that you're a deliverer and she said
[1:04:01] I know how how God saved y'all the now
[1:04:03] infested where the crocodile River I
[1:04:06] understand that there's a special call
[1:04:08] upon your life I met the I met the angel
[1:04:11] of the Lord their father met him a
[1:04:13] prayer when he was talking to him said
[1:04:14] God we've we've been here for so long so
[1:04:17] long where's our deliver at but there
[1:04:19] the vision of the Lord dropped down
[1:04:22] into Moses's family and he showed him
[1:04:25] that there was a deliverer coming and he
[1:04:27] said mama mama said I know that you're
[1:04:29] the one Moses I know that you're the
[1:04:31] deliverer I've done seen a special call
[1:04:33] upon your life I've seen how God got you
[1:04:35] out of trouble I've seen how God got you
[1:04:38] out of that mess I've seen how the
[1:04:39] Lord's worked on your life but that just
[1:04:42] having that intellectual knowledge was
[1:04:44] not enough for Moses to deliver the
[1:04:46] children of Israel he had to go back
[1:04:48] there on the back side of the desert and
[1:04:50] meet the budding beat the burning bush
[1:04:52] for himself you see you see God was
[1:04:55] trying to get his attention of Moses he
[1:04:57] was trying to get the attention of his
[1:04:59] Prophet so all of a sudden that Pillar
[1:05:01] of Fire Dropped Out of Heaven fell upon
[1:05:04] fell upon that bush and the Bush was not
[1:05:06] consumed what's because there was a
[1:05:08] conference that was getting ready to
[1:05:10] take place between Moses and the god of
[1:05:13] the Bible that was going to say that he
[1:05:16] heard the children's cry and you know
[1:05:18] that brother Bynum said that the church
[1:05:21] is in bondage he said the church is in
[1:05:23] bondage of sickness he said the church
[1:05:25] is crying and been crying for years for
[1:05:28] deliverance
[1:05:29] but that same Pillar of Fire that that
[1:05:31] swooped out of Heaven has swooped down
[1:05:34] into this building today
[1:05:36] you might be crying for deliverance you
[1:05:39] might be crying for help but the pillar
[1:05:41] of fire is your answer and the devil
[1:05:43] might tell you there is no help for you
[1:05:45] there is no relief there's no way out of
[1:05:47] your problem the devil every single time
[1:05:50] he opens his mouth he's lying
[1:05:54] there ain't never been a time that the
[1:05:56] devil opened his mouth that he ever told
[1:05:57] the truth but God over and over 8800
[1:06:01] times throughout the Bible he promised
[1:06:03] us something and it came to pass the
[1:06:05] devil made promises nine times in the
[1:06:07] Bible and every single time they failed
[1:06:10] because that the devil is a liar you see
[1:06:14] Old Slew Foot don't know nothing but
[1:06:16] nothing but to do is to lie he cannot
[1:06:19] create so he perverts he tries to
[1:06:22] destroy and he tries to create so he
[1:06:24] destroys more and more and more but if
[1:06:27] you're going to listen to a devil's lie
[1:06:29] I'd sure listen to one better than
[1:06:32] saying that you're not qualified or
[1:06:34] you're not elect
[1:06:34] [Music]
[1:06:36] because there's a God that says you are
[1:06:38] qualified and there is a God that says
[1:06:41] you are the elect
[1:06:43] so if you're going to listen to a
[1:06:44] devil's lie you better listen to
[1:06:46] something stronger than that
[1:06:49] but I don't believe you have to listen
[1:06:51] to any lie that the devil's got to tell
[1:06:53] you that you got to deal with sickness
[1:06:54] or you got to deal with this pain you
[1:06:56] got to deal with this crime baby you got
[1:06:57] to deal with this situation I believe
[1:06:59] that there's an answer
[1:07:04] there's an answer
[1:07:06] brother man said that to believe the
[1:07:08] devil's lie is to serve Satan
[1:07:13] so be careful what you allow the enemy
[1:07:16] to whisper in your ear and tell you
[1:07:17] these things and tell you what you're
[1:07:19] not good enough and you're not going to
[1:07:21] make it
[1:07:22] because if you listen to him
[1:07:26] you're showing that you're serving him
[1:07:31] he said why are you preaching the way
[1:07:33] you're preaching it's because I'm not
[1:07:35] going to allow one ounce of me to ever
[1:07:38] show that the devil's winning
[1:07:42] it doesn't matter how I feel it doesn't
[1:07:44] matter what I see it doesn't matter what
[1:07:46] I'm facing I'm going to stand here and
[1:07:48] I'm going to confess the word of God no
[1:07:50] matter what I see no matter what I feel
[1:07:52] no matter what you're going through
[1:07:54] let me tell you if you call me and you
[1:07:56] are in midst of trial you don't want me
[1:07:58] guessing
[1:08:00] you don't want me presuming you want
[1:08:03] somebody that knows what they're talking
[1:08:05] about
[1:08:06] if you get in a condition and you're
[1:08:08] about to die and you feel like it's a
[1:08:10] premature grave that's coming by your
[1:08:12] way you're gonna have one or something
[1:08:14] want to know somebody that knows that
[1:08:16] there's a power of life that can get you
[1:08:18] out of a premature grave
[1:08:20] you're not calling on somebody that
[1:08:23] doesn't know their God you're calling on
[1:08:25] somebody that's got authority of an
[1:08:27] office of a priesthood that recognizes
[1:08:29] that's what God in heaven today
[1:08:35] what was it Moses had heard about it but
[1:08:38] now he knew that there was a god down
[1:08:40] there
[1:08:41] heard about it from his mama's testimony
[1:08:43] but now he knew because he met him
[1:08:47] now you know you know good and well that
[1:08:49] you was in that spot in your condition
[1:08:50] of life where you'd heard about a God
[1:08:52] that healed you heard about a God that
[1:08:53] saved but when you've really found out
[1:08:55] that he's a God that hears you cry you
[1:08:58] became personal with him you see the
[1:09:00] Holy Ghost is a personal experience not
[1:09:03] something that's emotion it is and
[1:09:05] experience
[1:09:08] Hallelujah you see you can't focus on
[1:09:11] the things that you're seeing you can't
[1:09:12] focus on the problems that you're seeing
[1:09:14] I I aren't focused to see what Satan
[1:09:18] wants us to
[1:09:19] you see our eyes are focused by the word
[1:09:21] of the Lord to see the will of the word
[1:09:24] because our faith that God has dropped
[1:09:26] on the inside of our hearts and revealed
[1:09:28] to us is designed to see what God wants
[1:09:31] but brother random said the trouble of
[1:09:33] it is tonight that we got too many
[1:09:35] Christian people that's professing
[1:09:37] Christians that's got one eye on the
[1:09:38] world and the other one on the cross
[1:09:40] you'll fall as sure as a world he said
[1:09:42] let your eyes be single let your heart
[1:09:45] be single let your thoughts be single he
[1:09:48] said brother that rubs in but that hurts
[1:09:50] he said but it's good for you
[1:09:53] you see you can't serve God and serve
[1:09:55] Mammon at the same time you've got to
[1:09:57] let your eyes be single upon the word of
[1:10:00] God
[1:10:01] well back I got these new glasses I got
[1:10:04] out the shower and I put these new
[1:10:05] glasses on I thought dear Lord I'm going
[1:10:07] blind
[1:10:09] I couldn't see anything I didn't say
[1:10:10] nothing to Katie because I didn't I
[1:10:12] thought God had mercy I need help
[1:10:14] I couldn't see nothing I I had to watch
[1:10:17] tumbled around that's a dangerous thing
[1:10:18] to do I stumbled around I laid down for
[1:10:21] a minute thought man I don't got one of
[1:10:22] them migraines I never had a migraine in
[1:10:23] my life and I thought dear God it's
[1:10:25] going to hit me I didn't turn 35 didn't
[1:10:27] return 36 and things are starting to
[1:10:29] turn mad on me oh downhill now one I
[1:10:32] didn't realize is this big old dummy
[1:10:34] right here had his contacts in and tried
[1:10:35] to put his glasses on at the same time
[1:10:37] and I couldn't focus on the things that
[1:10:39] I was looking at and the problem was I
[1:10:41] couldn't see clearly where I was going
[1:10:43] because I had a double lens over top of
[1:10:46] my eyes and anytime that you got a
[1:10:48] double lens over top of the word of God
[1:10:49] you're not going to see the word of God
[1:10:51] correctly if you ever look into the
[1:10:53] Bible and you see three Gods you need to
[1:10:55] focus that thing down just a little bit
[1:10:57] tighter so that you see there's only one
[1:10:59] God you see you might be in that
[1:11:00] condition and all you're seeing is the
[1:11:02] problem and all you're seeing is a
[1:11:04] situation but if you can focus that
[1:11:06] thing on down there and really see what
[1:11:08] you're looking at you're seeing at an
[1:11:10] opportunity
[1:11:12] that's what God looks at your problems
[1:11:14] like their opportunities for him to show
[1:11:16] up
[1:11:17] stop looking at your problems as chaos
[1:11:20] in crisis look at your problems as an
[1:11:22] opportunity to bless the Holy One of
[1:11:25] Israel
[1:11:32] he's a pharaoh looked upon them
[1:11:34] out there out the same window but he's
[1:11:37] seen slaves he said but Moses seen the
[1:11:39] victory why he had focused himself
[1:11:42] though being a prince though through the
[1:11:45] air or air to the throne of Egypt he had
[1:11:47] focused himself away from the lust of
[1:11:49] the world he focused himself away from
[1:11:51] the beauty of power and he he had within
[1:11:54] his own potentials to receive that but
[1:11:56] he focused that out
[1:11:58] brother random said that Pharaoh had
[1:12:00] those same pharaohs did not Pharaoh did
[1:12:03] not have those potentials but he looked
[1:12:05] out the same window
[1:12:07] and he didn't see the same result as
[1:12:09] Moses saw you see he was offered it but
[1:12:11] he refused it and when he refused it
[1:12:13] then he couldn't focus it and he said no
[1:12:15] man after he's turned down the word of
[1:12:17] God can ever Focus itself into it
[1:12:19] because he refused the word that brings
[1:12:21] you in the relationship of Christ but
[1:12:23] you see what faith was doing for Moses
[1:12:25] the Revelation that Moses had is that
[1:12:28] those were the children of Abraham and
[1:12:31] Abraham being back there all of those
[1:12:34] years there was a prophecy that was
[1:12:36] still rolling
[1:12:39] you don't understand it but the cogs of
[1:12:41] Prophecy are rolling this morning they
[1:12:43] might roll slow but they're sure and you
[1:12:46] may not understand why you're going why
[1:12:48] why you're going through what you're
[1:12:49] going through a lot of times it's just
[1:12:51] the current thermometer or the
[1:12:54] temperature of laodicea that we're in it
[1:12:56] ain't always you
[1:12:59] it's the world that you're living in
[1:13:01] it's a demographics that you're in but
[1:13:04] our faith is like Moses is Faith we're
[1:13:06] designed to look past the things of what
[1:13:09] we see out there in the natural we're
[1:13:11] designed to see what God's will is and
[1:13:14] what he wants you're seeing when that
[1:13:16] Faith that's in you can focus you to the
[1:13:18] word you're focused away from the
[1:13:20] denominational Creeds and everything
[1:13:21] your focus right straight on the word of
[1:13:24] God you're zeroed in it only needs a
[1:13:26] little touch off amen that prayer flies
[1:13:29] straight into the presence of God
[1:13:30] because there's nothing to stop it yes
[1:13:33] that's what does it when you're zeroed
[1:13:35] in with God focused in by then you're
[1:13:38] looking at the Target you're not looking
[1:13:39] at what somebody else says this can't
[1:13:41] happen and that can't happen you're
[1:13:43] looking to what you did know happened
[1:13:51] you're focused
[1:13:54] to see
[1:13:55] if there's an angel that comes down at a
[1:13:57] certain season
[1:13:59] it begins to trouble the water
[1:14:02] and you might be laying there for 38
[1:14:03] years in your infirmity
[1:14:05] in your condition
[1:14:09] and you can look at that problem
[1:14:11] you can Circle that mountain all those
[1:14:13] days
[1:14:14] and thinkers nobody going to help you
[1:14:16] get in
[1:14:18] but if I can give you a glimpse into
[1:14:20] your future
[1:14:22] there's one that's walking
[1:14:25] there's one that's walking by your pool
[1:14:26] today
[1:14:29] and you might be waiting for the right
[1:14:30] moment you might be waiting for the
[1:14:32] right season you might be waiting for
[1:14:33] the troubling of the waters
[1:14:35] I don't want to tell you're in it
[1:14:38] you're not waiting to get in the water
[1:14:40] you're in the water
[1:14:46] so how do you know that because I'm
[1:14:48] watching the effects of the water
[1:14:51] so what do you mean brother Andrew
[1:14:53] brother random told us that Waters
[1:14:55] represent people
[1:14:56] and we are watching the effect of the
[1:14:58] word take a hold of your life
[1:15:01] how how did we
[1:15:04] this just really must blow Satan's mind
[1:15:06] how do we get terabires into this circle
[1:15:11] how do we get Stephen Byers into this
[1:15:13] circle what was it it was the effect of
[1:15:15] the angel
[1:15:17] and you look out there and say well how
[1:15:18] does this one getting in and how's that
[1:15:20] one getting in how are they getting
[1:15:21] delivered it's the effects of the angel
[1:15:23] in the water it's not the water
[1:15:26] you ain't got nothing to do with it but
[1:15:28] it's the Angel that's on the water and
[1:15:31] the same angel that was with William
[1:15:32] Branham is upon the people today and
[1:15:34] you're under the influence not a weak
[1:15:37] Angel but under the influence of a
[1:15:39] mighty angel
[1:15:40] and you might have walked in here one
[1:15:42] way today but you're gonna walk out of
[1:15:44] here completely different today because
[1:15:46] the effect of the Angel is operating in
[1:15:49] this room
[1:15:51] he might have laid there for all those
[1:15:52] years but the day's a new day I'm going
[1:15:55] to say to you like Jesus said pick up
[1:15:57] your bed and walk
[1:15:59] stop playing that in your condition stop
[1:16:02] crying on your pillar pick yourself up
[1:16:04] and walk with Jesus you can lay there if
[1:16:07] you want to but Jesus has already done
[1:16:09] the work you can cry all you want to you
[1:16:12] can have a pity party all you want to
[1:16:14] but get up and follow him out of the
[1:16:16] building
[1:16:23] Hallelujah
[1:16:24] I cried all those years but it was worth
[1:16:27] it
[1:16:28] I laid those on all those years it was
[1:16:31] worth it
[1:16:34] Hallelujah
[1:16:38] Abraham
[1:16:42] I've seen your faith
[1:16:44] I've seen that you trust me
[1:16:47] I've seen that you love me
[1:16:50] when I'm gonna put your faith to a test
[1:16:53] do you really believe me
[1:16:57] when I ask you to lay your Isaac down do
[1:16:59] you still believe me
[1:17:04] come on Church
[1:17:06] it's Flesh and Blood now
[1:17:09] it gets where it's real thick
[1:17:13] when God's asking you to lay your own
[1:17:15] flesh down it's getting real thick to it
[1:17:18] you better know the god that you're
[1:17:20] serving when God's asking you to lay
[1:17:21] your life down and the thing that you
[1:17:23] love with all of your life lay your
[1:17:25] family down lay your job down lay
[1:17:27] yourself lay your whole life down you
[1:17:29] better know the god that you're serving
[1:17:30] what he's asking for you you see the god
[1:17:32] that I'm serving is a God that turns it
[1:17:34] around and blesses you a hundredfold
[1:17:37] but you see if you don't recognize a God
[1:17:39] that I'm serving you're going to walk
[1:17:41] into this trial and you're going to walk
[1:17:42] in they're afraid but if you know the
[1:17:45] god that I'm talking about you can walk
[1:17:46] up there on Mount Moriah and be unafraid
[1:17:49] you can go up there with Isaac and know
[1:17:51] that you're coming down with Isaac or
[1:17:53] you can go up there and doubt him you
[1:17:55] can doubt that God changed your body you
[1:17:57] can doubt that he made a message come by
[1:17:59] your way you can doubt the melchizer
[1:18:01] that came by your way you can doubt all
[1:18:02] these things and and just walk off of
[1:18:04] there
[1:18:06] or you can go up on that mountain with
[1:18:08] Melchizedek
[1:18:10] and you can come down with Melchizedek
[1:18:12] you can walk up there with Isaac and
[1:18:14] come down with Isaac and when Abraham
[1:18:16] had proved himself to Father God and
[1:18:19] made the sacrifice he had the wood he
[1:18:21] laid Isaac out there
[1:18:24] Isaac was of age of 12 years old he knew
[1:18:27] the power of worship he understood what
[1:18:29] it was like he said father here's the
[1:18:32] wood here's the fire but where's the
[1:18:34] sacrifice but when he understood the
[1:18:36] call of the father upon his life he was
[1:18:38] Under The Obedience of the sacrifice
[1:18:42] because obedience
[1:18:44] greater than sacrifice
[1:18:51] put yourself there
[1:18:53] put your wife out there on that table
[1:18:55] put your son out there on that table put
[1:18:57] your daughter out there on that table
[1:19:00] oh come on now Satan's wanting them
[1:19:03] Satan's wanting to morrisoned than what
[1:19:05] you think you you'd understand Satan is
[1:19:08] wanting them if you read the news this
[1:19:10] week the lgbtqz said that they're coming
[1:19:13] after our children
[1:19:16] they said they're coming after our
[1:19:17] children Satan wants her children
[1:19:21] so if Satan's wanting them whose hands
[1:19:23] you're going to put them into
[1:19:27] now come on you got to lay them down one
[1:19:29] way or the other lay them on God's
[1:19:31] sacrifice or lay them on Satan sacrifice
[1:19:33] I'm not going to serve the life of devil
[1:19:36] I'm not going to serve him I'm going to
[1:19:38] put my child upon the word of God that
[1:19:40] can get them out of the problem that
[1:19:42] they're in
[1:19:43] come on now if he was God that gave you
[1:19:46] Isaac he's a God that's going to take
[1:19:48] care of Isaac you may not understand the
[1:19:50] backside of this desert experience but
[1:19:53] there is a promise there's a promise
[1:19:55] that's coming out of it that thy seed
[1:19:57] shall possess the Gate of autonomous
[1:20:00] because you obeyed me Abraham if you
[1:20:03] trust me I'll use you like never before
[1:20:11] and Abraham made the sacrifice ready
[1:20:14] and he heard the Cry of a ram and a
[1:20:16] thinking what was it he is Jehovah Jireh
[1:20:21] he's a God that provides
[1:20:25] I read a story years ago
[1:20:28] came my memory in the last couple weeks
[1:20:30] here
[1:20:31] there's a man by the name of Peter
[1:20:33] richly he was he was traveling he was
[1:20:36] traveling back and forth and he was
[1:20:38] headed from Australia to England back
[1:20:39] and forth that way and he got out on his
[1:20:41] ship
[1:20:43] and and the ship rent
[1:20:45] he was the only Survivor on that ship
[1:20:48] and there was another ship that came by
[1:20:50] and they rescued Peter richly out of
[1:20:53] this out of the waters there and Peter
[1:20:56] richly gets up there and he tells him
[1:20:57] what happened he was the only Survivor
[1:20:59] out of it
[1:21:01] this happened to Peter richly again
[1:21:03] same thing happened to him again
[1:21:06] he gets on the third boat and he tells
[1:21:08] him same story this goes on and happens
[1:21:10] five times
[1:21:12] true story
[1:21:13] happens five times to him he gets up
[1:21:15] there on a ship that's called the city
[1:21:17] of Leeds he gets up there
[1:21:20] he gets up there and he he gets up there
[1:21:22] and he tells it he tells the captain of
[1:21:24] the ship he tells him it's crazy story
[1:21:26] like man he's like this happened to me
[1:21:28] he said five times has happened I'm the
[1:21:30] only Survivor he said it's an odd
[1:21:31] feeling
[1:21:32] it's an odd feeling you're the only one
[1:21:34] there and he said God it must be saving
[1:21:36] me for some purpose and so Peter richly
[1:21:38] gets checked out by the doctor on the
[1:21:40] ship and he looks over and everything's
[1:21:41] clear and everything and they said so
[1:21:44] the physician said not look he said he
[1:21:46] said
[1:21:47] he said everybody on the ship and he
[1:21:49] said there's a lady on this ship that's
[1:21:51] she's dying she's been asking for her
[1:21:54] son to come and and Lord save my son
[1:21:57] before I die Lord save my son and she
[1:21:59] said he said the cat or the physician
[1:22:00] said now look everybody on the ship
[1:22:02] knows this lady they know this lady and
[1:22:05] she knows them and said you know maybe
[1:22:07] you could just play the part maybe you
[1:22:09] just go in there and play the part and
[1:22:11] try to act like her son and so that she
[1:22:13] can pass away easily there
[1:22:16] he said well sure he said he saved my
[1:22:17] life he took care of me he fed me he
[1:22:19] said I'll do whatever I got to do he
[1:22:21] goes in and he he's standing there and
[1:22:22] he walks in there's this there's this
[1:22:24] lady that's laying in the bed and she's
[1:22:25] just moaning God save my son God save my
[1:22:27] son Jesus she's there at the point of
[1:22:29] expiring there and the physician nudges
[1:22:32] Peter and he goes on up there and he
[1:22:35] goes around there
[1:22:36] and he goes to say Mom I'm here but he
[1:22:39] didn't have to play the part
[1:22:41] because that was his mama
[1:22:45] and there was a mama that was praying
[1:22:47] Lord save my son Lord save my son
[1:22:54] I don't know why I'm here but I'm here
[1:22:58] you might be in that condition today and
[1:23:00] you might think what in the world is God
[1:23:02] saving me for why is he you might have
[1:23:04] went through five shipwrecks but God's
[1:23:06] got a purpose in your life you might be
[1:23:08] that Mama that's still on the bed crying
[1:23:11] God save my son God save my son God save
[1:23:14] my son five times in shipwreck but God
[1:23:17] was a God that knew how to take care of
[1:23:20] him
[1:23:21] if God can take care of a man that was
[1:23:24] Shipwrecked how much more can he take
[1:23:26] care of the Church of the Living God you
[1:23:29] are built for a purpose and there's more
[1:23:31] than a mama that's crying out there's
[1:23:33] father God
[1:23:35] laughs
[1:23:36] Lord have mercy on me
[1:23:40] he's heard your claw blind Lord of his
[1:23:42] and even though people's trying to shut
[1:23:44] you up people try to say you're
[1:23:46] Pentecostal people's trying to say
[1:23:48] you're being too loud but Bartimaeus
[1:23:50] cried the more
[1:23:52] because the father heard your cry
[1:23:55] Hallelujah the father heard your crying
[1:23:58] your nervousness the father heard your
[1:24:00] cry in your complexes the father heard
[1:24:03] your cries in Parenthood
[1:24:07] Hallelujah
[1:24:09] foreign
[1:24:11] that woman
[1:24:14] immediately as soon as she seen her son
[1:24:16] that God had saved her son God restored
[1:24:18] her health and they went back to
[1:24:20] Australia as a family again
[1:24:26] Hallelujah
[1:24:28] Hallelujah
[1:24:30] might be divided and you might be abused
[1:24:33] you might go through complexes and you
[1:24:35] might go through her circumstances but I
[1:24:37] want you to know that you're walking out
[1:24:39] of here in this situation that you're in
[1:24:41] under the economy of the family of
[1:24:43] almighty God
[1:24:46] but Satan's after me brother Andrew
[1:24:48] don't you worry God's faster than Satan
[1:24:51] don't you worry God's bigger than your
[1:24:54] problem don't you worry God's bigger
[1:24:56] than your sickness God's bigger than
[1:24:58] your own self
[1:25:00] Hallelujah
[1:25:02] Hallelujah I have heard the Cry of my
[1:25:05] people and I am come down to deliver
[1:25:09] them

[1:25:16] what sin you're in I don't care what

[1:25:44] were built to be in real Apostolic
[1:25:46] Church you were built to be an invisible
[1:25:48] Army but Satan got you in the snare but
[1:25:50] you are built for a purpose to destroy
[1:25:52] Philistines and just because your eyes
[1:25:55] are gone doesn't mean that your power is
[1:25:57] gone and it might look like the Satan's
[1:25:59] got the battle that he's got to battle
[1:26:01] an array and he's winning the battle but
[1:26:03] all along Samson's hair was growing out
[1:26:06] again
[1:26:07] what is it you recognize that the
[1:26:10] Covenant was for you you might have
[1:26:12] messed up but the covenant's still there
[1:26:16] anybody else feeling what I'm feeling in
[1:26:18] here today it's time to put your hands
[1:26:21] on the pillars and push them over on the
[1:26:23] Philistines they've been lying on you
[1:26:25] they've been making fun of you put your
[1:26:27] power to work

[1:27:20] fight for that
[1:27:25] I got right to fight for it
[1:27:27] should Satan put us in the pawn shop
[1:27:29] he put us in her
[1:27:31] but God came and paid for us
[1:27:34] and we got a receipt in our hand by
[1:27:36] looking at the cross that the blood has
[1:27:38] already paid for you and I and you ain't

[1:28:02] cornbread and every single time a trip
[1:28:03] it kept trying to come back up he just
[1:28:05] kept saying I'm Healed in the name of
[1:28:07] the Lord Jesus Christ by his stripes I'm
[1:28:09] Healed and Satan said well you're doing
[1:28:11] nothing but lying and bringing an
[1:28:13] approach on the name of Jesus Christ and
[1:28:15] he said Satan if you don't like that

[1:30:29] denomination that believed that the days
[1:30:30] of Miracles were passed but she got a
[1:30:32] hold of a little book
[1:30:35] she got a hold of her little book and
[1:30:37] you might be sitting here and thinking
[1:30:39] why in the world am I here but God's got
[1:30:41] handfuls on purpose for you Georgie
[1:30:44] you heard about a testimonial about a
[1:30:46] little nail girl how did she got out of

[1:31:38] never coming by their way but Georgie
[1:31:40] there was a prophet praying a player and
[1:31:43] the Briar's hitting him in the face but
[1:31:44] the angel of the Lord got through
[1:31:47] thank you

[1:32:06] Full Gospel Lighthouse our Lord Jesus
[1:32:08] Christ has looked on your need and he's
[1:32:11] counted too worthy to stand
[1:32:14] not just stand there in defeat not just
[1:32:16] stand there and criticism not to stand
[1:32:18] there in sickness but to rise in Victory
[1:32:24] Georgie Carter

[1:35:39] I can't do it on my own brother Andrew
[1:35:41] I can't win this battle on my own why
[1:35:43] don't you let the mighty Angel just
[1:35:45] stare at thing down
[1:35:47] come on now you don't fault that thing
[1:35:49] all you're by yourself why don't you let
[1:35:51] the mighty Angels tear that thing down
[1:35:53] you've been looking that in the face and
[1:35:54] it's been whispering in your ear and
[1:35:56] telling you all kinds of Lies why don't
[1:35:58] you let the mighty angel look at that
[1:35:59] thing one time because when the mighty
[1:36:01] angel looks at the Devil he's got
[1:36:03] nowhere to run he is exposed he's got no
[1:36:06] backup he's got no power he's got no
[1:36:09] Authority you're tired of looking at it
[1:36:11] turn the mighty Angel loose on him turn
[1:36:13] the power of the Seven Seals loose on
[1:36:15] him turn the power of restoration loose
[1:36:17] on him you're not a weak child
[1:36:27] Hallelujah you got that scripture says
[1:36:31] I'm Opera I had to put my glasses back
[1:36:33] on this
[1:36:35] foreign
[1:36:41] give me kgv first please
[1:36:51] songs 40 and 1. stand with me
[1:36:54] I waited patiently for the Lord
[1:37:01] I waited patiently for him
[1:37:03] I waited patiently for the Lord and he
[1:37:06] had climbed unto my ear and heard my cry
[1:37:09] that's a God that you're serving
[1:37:13] and he brought me up also out of the
[1:37:15] horrible pit and out of the Myra clay
[1:37:17] and set my feet upon a rock and
[1:37:19] established my Goings and he hath put a
[1:37:24] new song in my mouth even praise unto
[1:37:27] our God many shall see it and fear and
[1:37:31] shall trust in the Lord Now give me the
[1:37:34] passion translation
[1:37:41] for the pure and Shining one a song
[1:37:44] a poetic praise you know where the
[1:37:48] greatest inspiration comes is dark
[1:37:50] moments
[1:37:54] just go to studying out Eddie perronet
[1:37:56] songs and go studying out some of the
[1:37:58] greatest songs that are written in
[1:37:59] history they're written in the most
[1:38:02] darkest dungeons
[1:38:05] where did Paul write his best scriptures
[1:38:09] Dale
[1:38:10] it's not a Philippians
[1:38:14] I waited
[1:38:16] and waited and waited some more
[1:38:19] how many been there
[1:38:24] patiently knowing that God would come
[1:38:26] through for me then at last he bent down
[1:38:30] and listened to My Cry
[1:38:32] and he stooped down to lift me up out of
[1:38:35] danger from the desolate pit I was in
[1:38:38] and out of the muddy mess I had fallen
[1:38:41] into now he lifted me up into a firm and
[1:38:45] secure place and steadied me wow I
[1:38:49] walked along the ascending path
[1:38:53] a new song for a new day Rises up in me
[1:38:56] every time I think about it how he
[1:38:59] breaks me through for me is static
[1:39:02] praise pours out of my mouth until
[1:39:04] everyone hears how God has Set Me Free
[1:39:06] many will see his miracles they'll stand
[1:39:09] in awe of God and fall in love with him
[1:39:16] because your chaos because you're bit
[1:39:19] many will fall in love with him because
[1:39:23] of me
[1:39:29] but I don't want to go through these
[1:39:31] things I don't want to go through my
[1:39:32] trial I'm ready to get out of it
[1:39:36] God
[1:39:37] has a purpose
[1:39:39] and your shipwrecks
[1:39:43] God has a purpose for you up on Mount
[1:39:45] Moriah
[1:39:46] that's a purpose for your daughter dying
[1:39:48] and slipping off to sleep go
[1:39:50] purpose
[1:39:52] because God wants to display his power
[1:39:57] as many times
[1:40:00] as many times throughout this past three
[1:40:02] and a half years I ask the Lord
[1:40:05] God
[1:40:11] if I could I'd take that from them and
[1:40:13] I'd put it on me
[1:40:15] I'd bear that for them I'd bear that for
[1:40:18] my dad
[1:40:19] I'd bear that for that one I bear for
[1:40:21] this one I'd go through that for them
[1:40:25] but he always comes back with the same
[1:40:27] reply you don't have to do that
[1:40:30] I already
[1:40:34] stop crying yourself to sleep
[1:40:37] and put on the oil Joy
[1:40:39] it's time to turn your morning into
[1:40:41] praise
[1:40:44] I'm still in my chaos turn into praise
[1:40:48] turn loose that ecstatic praise that'll
[1:40:51] turn somebody towards the father
[1:40:54] I'm still in trouble I'm still in my
[1:40:56] chaos turn loose your praise
[1:40:58] [Laughter]
[1:41:01] there's one thing I've learned in life
[1:41:03] I'm much of a Preacher but I am a
[1:41:05] worshiper
[1:41:08] I ain't much of an orator and I ain't a
[1:41:10] man that can put together much scripture
[1:41:11] and much quotes and no sayings but I
[1:41:13] know how to worship and if that's all
[1:41:15] that I've got to give God I'm going to
[1:41:17] learn to worship like nobody else can
[1:41:20] worship I'm Gonna Learn To Praise my way
[1:41:22] through
[1:41:24] and if there's one thing I've learned
[1:41:26] about worship it's when you don't feel
[1:41:28] like worshiping and it's when you don't
[1:41:30] look like the problems getting answered
[1:41:31] that's the time to praise him
[1:41:35] when it don't look like he's heard to
[1:41:37] cry that's the time to thank him for the
[1:41:40] answer
[1:41:42] foreign
[1:41:53] you got me
[1:41:55] you got me today
[1:41:59] you talked to me today

[1:42:11] don't give up
[1:42:13] because if you give up right now you're
[1:42:14] gonna always give up
[1:42:19] bro Jonathan sent me something a while
[1:42:21] back said you could always win a battle
[1:42:22] but you could never win a surrender
[1:42:26] you give up and you surrender you'll
[1:42:28] never be able to get out of it
[1:42:30] but if you keep battling you can win
[1:42:35] you can win
[1:42:36] don't give up
[1:42:39] well you got that last when you have
[1:42:41] that last breath

[1:43:03] but two months ago
[1:43:05] he showed me me preaching this service
[1:43:07] with you in it

[1:43:20] how are you here
[1:43:22] how are you in this room
[1:43:24] how'd you get where you are

[1:44:15] upon me for he has anointed me to preach
[1:44:17] to tell you that the Captivity of Israel
[1:44:21] is over
[1:44:24] it's time that you trade in your ashes
[1:44:27] for beauty and it's time that you turn
[1:44:30] your feet to dancing the spirit of the
[1:44:33] Lord is here to say I have heard thy cry
[1:44:42] thank you

[1:44:50] presence
[1:44:53] are you sure that when you take your
[1:44:54] petitions before him you know that you
[1:44:56] can ask all things of God and he will
[1:44:58] give the very desires of the heart are
[1:45:01] you sufficiently impressed with his word
[1:45:03] that if you abide in me and my words

[1:45:06] and it shall be done unto you do you
[1:45:09] really believe
[1:45:11] that when you can't
[1:45:13] he can
[1:45:18] father God
[1:45:20] we're in a very special moment
[1:45:24] father when you woke me up this morning
[1:45:26] and changed my course
[1:45:29] I studied I studied I put hours of study
[1:45:32] in
[1:45:35] I slept I dreamed about these thoughts
[1:45:38] that I was thinking about preaching
[1:45:40] I spent many hours praying about it
[1:45:44] just like I always do
[1:45:46] but this morning you woke me up and said
[1:45:48] today's a special day
[1:45:52] father
[1:45:55] we feel hopeless sometimes and we feel
[1:45:58] helpless
[1:45:59] but when we were at our weakest that's
[1:46:01] when we're made strong
[1:46:04] father who is this old great Mountain
[1:46:06] that stands before zeroom
[1:46:09] and I shall be made like a plane
[1:46:15] it's not by our Midas not by our power
[1:46:19] but by the spirit oh Lord
[1:46:22] when cancer is riding and it's trying to
[1:46:25] Triumph all of our Victory we will rise
[1:46:28] up more than conquerors when troubles
[1:46:31] and distress come by our way we will
[1:46:33] lift our eyes the ones that help towards
[1:46:36] the hill where our help comes from
[1:46:39] you are our everything and you are all
[1:46:42] Lord there's nothing I can point your
[1:46:44] children to that's greater than you
[1:46:47] no matter what they're in no matter the
[1:46:48] condition that they face no matter what
[1:46:50] they're facing God you are their help
[1:46:53] and you are their stay
[1:46:56] when William Branham was in a spot when
[1:46:59] he was lost to walking around Hurricane
[1:47:00] Mountain and he thought he had it all
[1:47:02] figured out for himself
[1:47:04] heard a word say I'm a very present help
[1:47:08] in a time of trouble
[1:47:10] father if you could just put your hand
[1:47:13] upon us today and let us turn our back
[1:47:15] and see the mountain clearly so that we
[1:47:18] know which direction to walk in we've
[1:47:19] been walking in clouds and we've been
[1:47:21] walking around this death Circle for so
[1:47:23] long and we need help
[1:47:26] oh God just turn our Direction may we
[1:47:29] lift our hands towards the heaven where
[1:47:31] our help is
[1:47:33] and may we grab a hold of the line

[1:47:37] is true and dear to our hearts oh God

[1:48:02] towards us

[1:48:08] if you saw Hagel
[1:48:10] how much more do you see us
[1:48:14] the other women might look like our well
[1:48:16] was empty but you've just told us to get
[1:48:18] into the channels of it Lord

[1:48:30] through this trial
[1:48:32] I thank you for the opportunity that you
[1:48:34] counted me worthy to stand temptation
[1:48:37] I thank you Lord Jesus that you counted
[1:48:39] me worthy that I could stand and call
[1:48:41] and confess that you're the god that
[1:48:43] heals and you're the god that delivers
[1:48:45] thank you for healing our brother Donnie
[1:48:47] Nicholson and touching his body oh God
[1:48:49] when he's crying out for help and he's
[1:48:52] in pain and he's in agony you're the god
[1:48:54] that hears every single pain whether we
[1:48:57] speak it or whether we don't Paul said
[1:48:59] in the Book of Romans that you the
[1:49:02] spirit makes intercessions for our
[1:49:04] groanings when the things that we can't
[1:49:05] even speak and utter you know what we
[1:49:08] mean from our heart Lord Jesus
[1:49:10] father thank you for the opportunity
[1:49:12] thank you for the opportunity to
[1:49:15] recognize you as a Healer
[1:49:18] there's a God that delivers
[1:49:20] there's a God that sees and understands
[1:49:24] so father we won't be silent
[1:49:34] amen do you love the Lord
[1:49:38] Hallelujah
[1:49:40] Hallelujah
[1:49:44] you ask for it
[1:49:49] how many squirrels you're asking for
[1:49:50] Billy Branham
[1:49:52] three
[1:49:55] but when you can't find but two
[1:49:57] are you gonna give up
[1:50:01] you remember he said I was
[1:50:05] I was about to give up looking going he
[1:50:07] said but the angel turned me said but
[1:50:08] you asked for three
[1:50:12] just because you see part of the problem
[1:50:14] has come to pass don't give up on the
[1:50:16] rest of what you've asked
[1:50:19] let the Fulfillment ever come
[1:50:22] after all I've taught you asked big
[1:50:25] things and ask specific things
[1:50:28] and when you ask those specific things
[1:50:29] you put details upon it that only you
[1:50:32] can ask you'll know that it was God
[1:50:38] Sister Crystal asked for a specific job
[1:50:42] I told her to ask for something big and
[1:50:44] ask for something specific
[1:50:46] and she knew that God had answered her
[1:50:48] prayer because of the specific things
[1:50:50] come to pass
[1:50:52] how many here has been said those same
[1:50:54] prayers you asked for certain things you
[1:50:56] ask for big things when it didn't look
[1:50:58] like things were coming but you asked
[1:51:00] anyway
[1:51:02] and because you were sufficiently
[1:51:03] impressed with this President you asked
[1:51:12] Hallelujah
[1:51:14] I don't believe it's anything
[1:51:17] too big for our God

[1:51:22] moment
[1:51:24] let the musicians come

[1:51:30] clean heart oh God
[1:51:33] and renew a right Spirit Within Me
[1:51:36] oh God
[1:51:43] crying ain't always a bad thing
[1:51:50] a lot of people look on crying
[1:51:52] as defeat
[1:51:56] and there's a statement that said that
[1:51:58] Satan saw me with my head down and
[1:52:00] thought I was defeated and then I said
[1:52:02] amen
[1:52:07] crying Ain't a Bad Thing
