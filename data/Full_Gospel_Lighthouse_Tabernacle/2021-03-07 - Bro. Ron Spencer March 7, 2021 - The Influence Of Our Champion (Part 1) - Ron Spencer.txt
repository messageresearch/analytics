[Music] you [Music] [Applause] hallelujah how great is our god how great is our color today is a very special day day we've prayed for a day that we as a church family have have longed to see our brother donny nicholson back in church praise the lord praise the lord we so love you with all our heart church ain't the same without you brother donny's been through a little bit of a battle but i believe he's on the other side of it this time we're gonna invite brother gabriel to come sing a special with us this morning yeah quick testimony if if i can really just calm down my nerves but you know i think i believe if i've got it right ron had his brain surgery about a year ago is march 5th of last year right well that was right around same time god really was pulling on my heart i was actually going to go work with brother andrew and adam that next morning and that night i was up there at the hospital and something pulled on my heart to go and go and speak with speak with ron because i'd just been running and running and i was tired of running and i didn't know i didn't know what the future held but i was like you know i've got to go gotta go speak with him and at that point i decided and i told i told god i told andrew even that next night in service like i'm tired of running i want to come back to god and ever since that moment even it answers prayer last night as i saw malachi walk up because i just wanted to see my brother and my two brothers and my sister get the same same touch i did and you know with my job i know it seems like we're probably always running and writing tickets and doing everything like that but the truth is is i do have a lot of down time which is great because one uh not not too long after i've made this transfer up here is there's in rock bridge brother denny you probably know where i'm talking about us there's a there's a mountain there in between the interstate and i can i can count on every single time if i if i need to go and get a little escape i can go up there and i can pray you know there was one night it was probably three o'clock in the morning when i was working is i got outside my car i was praying and i'd actually i'd got down on my knees and i was praying about a couple things and i was praying that i could just see the presence of god come down and you know as i stood up at the end of that prayer something told me just to look up as i looked up over to the left-hand side excuse me over to the left-hand side i saw the cloud that appeared to be jesus and as i looked at it you know in my mind naturally the devil was going to attack and he was he was attacking me he said that's nothing that's nothing it's just a cloud well that entire night had been a clear night until that moment as i began to raise my hands and praise the lord for showing me that sign as that cloud just swept from left to right over top of me and in my mind i was thinking you know if i could just even see a fallen star right now i could just verify even more that this is god right now as soon as i started to think that and i was raising my hands and praising god a shooting star went right through the middle of that cloud and it just vanished right there as it was and ever since then as i've just been able to see that and every time i see it falling stars you guys may see them a lot but to me i know that god's right there with me and i've and i've been i've been testifying to and i told andrew and i told ron of that same thing and and you know there was one there was one night saturday night andrew was preaching and as he was preaching as i saw a streak of light come as he was preaching and i believe it was brother ron that i heard a voice say somebody's about to get it there was a streak of light that went to the back of the church off to that the right hand side of the church as soon as i heard that voice it's the presence of god fell on somebody in that back left corner i'm not sure who it was but i knew right then and i was i was testifying to sarah about that right after church asking her if she had seen anything right around that same time as soon as that happened there was another ball of light that came down that was a green green light again that testified to me and her both as we saw that not too shortly after um i know judy she found out that she was she was pregnant right at that time and then i got to see my sister she she decided she wanted to get baptized in the middle of january when it was one of the coldest mornings of the winter and i just thank god for everything he's done in my life but continuously to doing the church and my family as well [Applause] [Music] maybe hard-pressed on every side but i won't be crushed i'll be all right i may be doubting the place i'm in [Music] i may be down but i'm not out you're not finished very same light that pierced the dark the very same word that still the sea the very same spirit that tore [Music] greater truth is who you are the one who heals who redeems and says can turn it around who can still make a way the very same life that pierced the dark the very same word that's still the same the very same spirit that tore the veil is alive in me you're alive in me the very same power that healed our hearts the very same love that sets us free the very same spirit that conquered death is alive in me you're alive in me it's all ready so whatever comes i know where i place my hope and trust i can overcome cause of what's been done cause of what you feel is lord across the very same light that pierced the dark the very same word that still the sea the very same spirit that tore the veil is alive in me you're alive in me the very same power that healed our hearts the very same love that sets us free the very same spirit that conquered death is alive in me you're alive in me [Applause] oh praise the lord aren't you thankful there's a god that's alive on the inside amen let's stand this morning as i'm getting ready to change the order of the service just enter into a spirit of witness and a spirit of worship and a spirit to praise our lord jesus christ oh hallelujah hallelujah let's sing that song hour of your love lord i lord i come to you i i enjoy singing but i ain't no good without sister cassie so so if i got to go sing somewhere i'm going to go with sister cassie and she knows all the keys i need to be in and i ain't got a clue where i need to be in so and sometimes she ain't got much to work with up here to you let my heart be changed renew or flowing from the grace oh hallelujah lord i've come to know oh lord i've come to know the weaknesses i see [Music] me we'll be stripped away by the power of your love the holy ghost oh oh let your love surround oh bring me near and draw me to your side [Music] oh and i will soar with you your spirit leads me all in the power of your love lord unveil my eyes oh let me see your face or to face the knowledge of your love as you live oh in me oh jesus lord renew my mind oh as your will unfolds every day by the power of your love o holy ghost holy ghost oh jesus oh oh just bring me near and draw me to your side [Music] like your spirit leads me all in the power of your love let's sing that one more time holy ghost i'll just enter in [Applause] ghost every draw me to your side as we wait our eyes of life oh your spirit leads me on in the power of your love i'll just give the lord a handclap of praise hallelujah god's come down to do something special here today it's already been spoke over you you just get ready to receive it what's coming forth from the eternity is getting ready to bless the heavenly and watch that life change oh holy ghost bring me near and draw me to your side [Music] our eyes of light your spirit leads me on in the power of your love [Music] hallelujah there's no presence like his presence amen god bless you we certainly love you so good to see each and every one of you with all my heart i love you so good to be in the house of the lord i thought last night was and i just say this from my heart and i thought last night was one of the greatest services i've ever set in i mean that i i mean that maybe you would say i'm prejudiced but i've set in a lot of services in my life truthfully i've said in some i wish i hadn't been in but [Music] i love it when god just a man's word we live in a very special time and in that special time we we know that we know that god's doing incredible things we're in a special season special anointing is happening even this week i know you pay attention to the news a bit the pope makes a move to go to the birthplace of [Music] abraham now whether you realize this or not no pope which is the leader to almost 2 000 years has never went to that spot a lot of negotiations behind the scene happen to make that take place and you don't just go to anybody he goes to their leaders and set yesterday for about 40 45 minutes and had a conversation here's two men that represent literally millions of people on the earth you see it's biblical prophecy that this pope not necessarily this pope but the pope will be a leader during the tribulation period and he'll bring the whole religions of the world together and he will be called man of peace america's not innocent in that just in the last few days they've rearranged the agreement with iraq so that that meeting could take place our president has made moves against israel and is once again reestablishing with palestine you see all of those things are biblical things to take place and as i stand in this pulpit this morning i realize that we are do we have another sunday do we have another two weeks do we have another year i would say after last night's service last week with brother wayne being here we're looking in a higher realm and we've got to realize 100 the play in games that's done the play in church that's done we are fully committed we're totally fully committed that god would just move in our lives like never before amen amen and amen we certainly love you with all of our hearts and we we thank you for for everything and every prayer and every situation and and we love you so glad to have our sister with us and she's going to be with us for a bit and so we're so happy that you're here i understand you've been with two of my friends in your life and and uh brother isaiah brooks amen and so we love him with all of our hearts and uh and your pastor in africa i preach conventions with him and love him as well and so god bless you i hope you find this a good place amen i know you'll find a lot of friends here and we we already we already love you and don't know you well yet so but we were together before the foundation of the world amen amen thank you brother nathanael he's here as a precautionary this morning the devil's trying a few things and so he's a loser but it's always good to have a backup just in case and so amen god bless you god bless you god bless you if you will turn with me to matthew chapter 6 and verse 9 then we'll go to revelations chapter 5. i'd like to look at the influence of our champion the influence of our champions name this is jesus's prayer it's very familiar to you and he's praying praying to god and only one thing in his mind it's doing the father's will and i want to say this to you that's all i have in my mind i really don't want to please myself i want to please him at the end of the day i want to please him that's all i have in my heart's desire jesus said this and after this manner therefore pray ye our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen for if ye forgive men their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you but if you forgive not men their trespasses neither will your father forgive you your trespasses amen you may be seated to see it's me evening hallelujah may it not be the night when we finish so revelations chapter 5 and verse 1. and i saw in the right hand of him that sat on a throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals and i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof of all of the messengers down through the ages none of them were permitted to go to this portion even great men we mentioned just a week or so ago even spurgeon warned his ministers in his colleges don't touch that there will come a profit at the end that will deal with the seals that was good wisdom think of this god in this great wisdom writes a book so simple but yet so in depth to where the schools of men with some not just just a few men but thousands even millions have tried to open this scripture they know that's the truth have tried to open the scriptures and when you say brother ryan open the scriptures the baptism the godhead you want one just a little bit more complex abraham and sarah turning young again and moses writes it in such a way he hides it until this day [Applause] are you with me and even brother branham said that's one of the mysteries that would be given under the seals under the seventh seals and who was that to you so you are under the influence of an open book or the mighty angel now who is worthy to take this book no man in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look on i want you to just grasp that now of all the men of all the ages nobody could open this book nobody could open it john's writing this and he says i wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read neither to look thereon and one of the elders saith unto me we've not behold the lion of the tribe of judah we all ought to shout right here the root of david had prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof you say brother ron what was important about what was in the book my name was there [Applause] redemption was there it was all important that i found my name written in the book and i beheld in the midst of the throne and the four beasts in the midst of the elder stood a lamb this was not william branham's message this was the message of the lamb and as it was been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits sent forth into all the earth and he came and he took the book out of the right hand of him that set up on the throne and when he had taken the book and the four beasts and the four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them hearts and golden vials full of odors who which are the prayers of the saints and they sung a new song thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and hast redeemed us to god by the blood out of every kindred tongue people and nation and has made us god and kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth hallelujah in revelation chapter 9 it talks about the depths of the the bottomless pit and the demons from the bottomless pit and all of their influence and we'll get into that just a bit but all of their influence on the earth and let me just say you and i live in laodicea to where that hell has has been enlarged and this has been declared by the prophet satan's eden it has been declared by the prophet the god of this evil age are you with me we know where we're standing we realize that there's an influence on the earth that's heading it toward a tribulation period are you with me listen when elvis presley came on the scene martin luther king came on the scene they had great influence are you with me now now let me just share this with you champions or men in great position has an influence and their followers you can tell what a man is influenced by by his actions by his conduct by his dress by the way he speaks by the music that he listens to by the books that he reads by the influence that he is under he literally takes on a personality how many of us personally impersonators are we have in the earth how many little boys became under the influence of a michael jordan are you with me and i may be behind the times now but you listen who's the greatest or or a tom brady or or whatever it would be and they get under the influence of those individuals or the influence of some hollywood star or a marilyn monroe or the goddess of this day i find it interesting that demus shakarian that sold the pentecostal church right into catholicism are you with me that his grandfathers the kardashians and that's the kardashians and i'm sorry this may get to them but this is the way they is they sold their birthright they sold their birthright and i don't care how much money they have it's not enough to go to hell for you can dress yourself up as a goddess of the world but let me just say you're only reflecting another realm are you with me are you with me now now that becomes the goddess of some people's minds forgive me for going in that negative realm just for a moment but don't let yourself get caught looking at the wrong kind of champion can i have 100 participation there [Applause] are you with me we're not playing church here young people don't get yourself your eyes with people influenced from a demonic realm is that all right is that all right sometimes people get influenced in the political realm don't don't even fool with that nonsense are you with me we live in age right now in a time right now where covet has paralyzed the world but you've got an angel with you [Applause] hey listen i agree with being safe and being protective and washing hands and wearing masks and and keeping and keeping distances as well i i try to participate in all of that but let me just say my i'm not looking to the political system to keep me safe [Applause] because they don't know what causes it and they don't know what prevents it but we've got a god that's greater than all of that nonsense revelation chapter 10. let's have a take a moment here and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven you're either influenced from one realm or another round brother right i'm sitting on the fence you're either influenced from one realm or another realm either king jesus is sitting on the throne of your heart now i mean let me just let you fill in the blink here our king is sitting on the room of your hearts there is no neutral ground it is either king jesus or king lucifer [Applause] and that's why you must have a new birth it is imperative that you have a new birth well brother ron is all of that necessary that happened here last night i would say for that young man his life has changed and there was influence that was trying to pull him this way and that way and this way and that way let me just say the kingdom this world will pull you in many directions but there's a god of heaven that will pull you because that seed that was planted there before the foundation of the world now this message is under the influence notice in verse 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished there's not another messenger coming let me just say this to you if this message did not awaken you and prepare you for the rapture i want to say this very clearly to you there's not another one coming now brother branham as the earthly messenger god allowed him and entrusted him but he was he was accompanied by the angel of the lord the ark of the covenant the i am was among him the messenger himself brother brown would tell us you're not feeding on the mind of a man you're feeding on the body word of the son of man jesus christ himself are you with me before 63 he was probing after the seals were revealed and christ came down revelations 10 1 after that was fulfilled he said what was prophecy now is history are you with me and now listen the earthly messenger had to depart it was part of the decreasing and the increasing are you with me the earthly messenger had to leave but brother ronnie he left by a car wreck hit back by a by a drunk god's not dainty how he takes his servants off of the earth whether it was chopping his head off with a chop block are you with me he's not danky how he takes his messengers don't get your wrap your eyes off of how men leave the earth when god's done with them he's done with them are you with me he'll raise another are you with me are you with me now i want to say some strong things right here so you hang right with me now i want you very alert we are not under the influence of michael jordan we're not under the influence of donald trump [Applause] are you with me now listen we did not come as ministers to be little weak and branhams [Applause] but we are under the influence of the mighty angel himself that strong angel the voice that is behind the voice the author of the book the author and the future of our faith and he is here to do business to finish the work because remember the book your names were there [Applause] and he will not lose one he knew you were coming he preserved your seed [Applause] you're one out of a million and he watched over you and your attributes all the way down do you think he's brought you this far to lose you [Applause] [Music] do you think he's brought you this far to just leave you in the stream [Applause] he's more determined he's more determined now than ever to finish this race could you just bow your head and pray andrew would you come in free god bless you [Applause] the enemy has tried to stop this word the enemy has tried to stop the influence of this angel but the angel cannot be stopped the angel is on the move he's determined to finish what he started he's determined to get you where you need to be at he's determined that your prayers that you have prayed they will go there and they will set those things free that you've been asking for those those things that that are being held up in your life those things that are held up that prayer is going to break that because there's power and prayer there's an angel that is with you there's an angel that's watching you and you are god's children who has more power in heaven and earth a son of god or an angel in heaven you do and when you started praying in the name of jesus christ it's as if jesus was praying you are under the influence of another you're not under the influence as brother ron said of michael jordan or the things of the world you're under the influence of an angel that has taken a message that's put it in the in the lips of the of human beings and has taken that message and is running with that message you see god isn't just in the business of of sending a message and letting it lay on the ground or letting it lay on tapes it's coming off of that tape it's coming into book form and it's coming off a book form into human form and that's where the enemy has trouble at is when the word of the hour comes off of the pages of the book and it comes in human form and human form starts taking that word and starts living out what was said and there's a people on earth today that are walking in the footsteps of the son of man the same authority the same life the same power the same anointing you are the walking in the footsteps of the son of man when he walked on earth he healed the leper when he walked on earth he raised a dead man when he walked on earth he did these things because he was influenced by the father he said in john chapter 5 and 19 i can do nothing except my father first chose me you're not here by happenstance this morning you're here because the father sent you here and when the authority of that word comes forth from a bride that has the same life on the inside of her it'll produce the same works that the angel produced you don't have to get shook up about you got to do this and you got to do that or what's going to happen in my life the angel will do the work [Music] you are told just to prophesy you're to stand there and stand in your position roll your shoulders back say i am a son of god i was told to prophesy i was told to speak this word i was told to live this word satan move off of god's property he's tried to stop ron spencer this morning but the angels here the angels visited us this morning you said i wanted more from ron spencer in 15 minutes if you could capture what happened in the last 15 minutes it'll set your world all three it'll set your heart offline it'll set your soul free if you can realize what happened here [Music] [Applause] can you imagine the
