[52:10] Brother Kelly's and then at brother
[52:12] Tim's and of course I was with you on
[52:14] one night there somewhere or another and
[52:17] and uh we certainly had a wonderful time
[52:21] Heaven's going to be a place where we'll
[52:22] never depart from one another ever again
[52:26] and the thing that we find and as you
[52:29] well know is people just like you all
[52:32] over the world called The Bride of Jesus
[52:35] Christ and that's what this message has
[52:38] produced and so we certainly appreciate
[52:40] you and all that all that you done many
[52:43] of you were at the meeting last week at
[52:45] brother Tims and amen and our our saxs
[52:49] player was a star there and so we
[52:51] certainly enjoyed having her there each
[52:54] and every one of you Matthew he's
[52:57] back he's back nobody lik Matthew and so
[53:01] had a wonderful time with Matthew
[53:02] Matthew got on the stage there one time
[53:06] and amen we
[53:09] certainly someday we'll tell you all
[53:11] about it but uh we certainly enjoyed
[53:14] being there with brother Tim and brother
[53:16] Wayne and brother who else preached with
[53:18] me Kelly Kelly yeah amen well that
[53:22] happened day before yesterday so amen
[53:25] amen had a wonderful time and uh looking
[53:27] forward to
[53:29] tomorrow amen it's just just looking
[53:31] forward to that amen isn't he good to us
[53:35] amen we're coming down to the end of the
[53:38] line and we can see by the things that
[53:40] are happening in the world the world has
[53:43] become a tender box and it's getting
[53:45] ready to get on fire and there's some
[53:48] things that are going on where leaders
[53:50] are saying that this is the last war
[53:52] that will be taking place and so whether
[53:54] it is or not we realize that events
[53:58] begin to happen and they come right up
[54:00] against the Rapture and because of a
[54:03] predestinated seed God will back them
[54:06] off with the angels of the Lord amen one
[54:09] of these days he won't back them
[54:13] off and we just we just realized that we
[54:16] could be getting ready to go home here
[54:19] just in a very short time and so we we
[54:22] certainly want to be
[54:23] ready and and if there's anything that I
[54:26] can give you advice to be is like Moses
[54:29] instructed the children of Israel when
[54:31] you eat that lamb have your feet
[54:35] shot have your clothes on get your
[54:38] traveling clothes ready cuz we're going
[54:41] to be
[54:42] leaving eat that lamb commune with that
[54:45] lamb make sure that you eat it all
[54:47] residue burn it with fire the Death
[54:50] Angel is coming by and once it comes by
[54:52] there's going to be a spirit of the Lord
[54:54] that will cause pharaoh to harden his
[54:56] heart and tell you to go so I would say
[54:59] this to you we don't know when it'll
[55:02] happen that's right but have your shoes
[55:05] on have your shoes on don't put off
[55:09] coming to the Lord if you're a prodal
[55:11] come
[55:12] home come home come home and well
[55:16] brother Ron I'm ashamed to come back
[55:17] come home come on yeah you may be greasy
[55:21] and dirty but we got a blood that'll
[55:23] take care of that hallah well we got a
[55:26] blood and and and and you say well
[55:27] brother Ron i' I've send away my day of
[55:29] Grace you're still
[55:31] breathing so come home and come home and
[55:34] we'll we'll help you get there we hope
[55:37] you get there God bless you tonight and
[55:39] we certainly love you with all of our
[55:41] hearts and and um I hadn't I've been
[55:45] away a little bit and so Andrew
[55:47] instructed me to preach tonight so I'll
[55:49] try to do as good as Andrew does and so
[55:52] looking forward to shaking your hand
[55:53] tomorrow and and and uh uh enjoying some
[55:56] food with you always enjoy this time and
[55:59] I think it's important it's one of the
[56:01] important days that we have right
[56:04] because because we're going to a land
[56:06] where we're going to Fellowship through
[56:09] eternity oh what a day that's going to
[56:12] be and all be young there'll be no
[56:14] watches and be no hurry and
[56:17] so we're we're that's why we're trying
[56:20] to enjoy services like this to get
[56:22] ourselves ready to go amen if you turn
[56:25] with me to habca chapter
[56:27] 2 and then Psalms chap 118 and verse
[56:32] 22 habca chapter 2 and verse Two Brother
[56:36] Wayne Lawson he he actually used this on
[56:39] Sunday morning and I already had in my
[56:43] notes for tonight so if you accuse me of
[56:46] uh of copying brother Wayne that'll be
[56:49] okay too
[56:51] so amen what a powerful preacher amen
[56:55] habca chapter 2 and verse
[57:00] two
[57:02] amen and the Lord answered me and said
[57:05] write the vision and make it plain upon
[57:09] tables that he might run that readeth it
[57:13] for the vision is for an appointed time
[57:16] but the end but at the end it shall
[57:19] speak and not lie though it t wait for
[57:24] it
[57:25] because it will surely
[57:27] come it will not
[57:30] t Psalms 118 and verse
[57:36] 22 the stone which the builders refused
[57:39] is become the head of the
[57:41] corner and this is the Lord's doing and
[57:43] is marvelous in our
[57:45] eyes this is the day which the Lord hath
[57:48] made we will rejoice and be glad in it I
[57:52] think it's important that we realize the
[57:54] moment that we're standing in God made
[57:57] this day to be exactly like it is and we
[58:00] can Rejoice because we're here save now
[58:04] I beseech thee Oh Lord oh Lord I beseech
[58:07] thee send now
[58:09] Prosperity
[58:11] Blessed Be he that cometh in the name of
[58:14] the Lord and we have blessed you out of
[58:17] the house of the Lord God is the Lord
[58:21] which hath showed us light buying the
[58:24] sacrif spice with cords even the horns
[58:27] of the altar Thou Art my God and I will
[58:31] praise thee Thou Art my God and I will
[58:34] exalt thee oh give thanks for unto the
[58:37] Lord for he is good for his mercy
[58:41] endureth forever maybe of a need on your
[58:44] heart you just like to pray Lord Jesus
[58:46] we love you tonight and we're so
[58:48] thankful to be standing here again Lord
[58:51] we ask you that you would bless this
[58:53] audience as we stand stand here in your
[58:55] presence one more time we don't know we
[58:58] we Mark these moments and we we just ask
[59:01] you that you would help us strengthen us
[59:03] tonight anoint us Lord and may our minds
[59:07] just be clear to where we can just grasp
[59:10] the the word of the Lord touch our
[59:12] hearts now we pray in Jesus Christ's
[59:15] name we pray amen and amen you may be
[59:23] seated
[59:26] I'd like to speak to you and and just
[59:28] start the subject no way can I cover it
[59:31] but I'd like to speak to you on time
[59:35] intercepting with
[59:38] prophecy sometimes when a when the voice
[59:40] of of God speaks through a
[59:44] prophet it may not fulfill itself while
[59:47] that Prophet is on the scene maybe it'll
[59:50] be hundreds of years the word will
[59:53] circle the Earth for literally 800 years
[59:56] or whatever it would be Behold a virgin
[1:00:00] shall conceive no doubt a lot of people
[1:00:03] thought well the message hasn't come to
[1:00:05] pass and so Isaiah's gone but you see
[1:00:09] everything has a time in a
[1:00:12] season and so there comes a time when
[1:00:15] the wheels of Prophecy will hit certain
[1:00:18] cogs and it will begin to fulfill we
[1:00:22] realize as the Bride of Jesus Christ we
[1:00:24] very much aware that we're reading
[1:00:26] tomorrow's newspaper we realize that
[1:00:30] just like when Jesus was on the cross
[1:00:32] from the time that they arrested him the
[1:00:36] Prophecies of the Old Testament begin to
[1:00:38] roll literally so fast you couldn't keep
[1:00:41] up with them that's right they begin to
[1:00:43] be fulfilled and Jesus would go through
[1:00:46] his life and say that it might be
[1:00:48] fulfilled that it might be fulfilled
[1:00:51] that it might be fulfilled and he would
[1:00:54] do do certain things because the word
[1:00:56] was quoting the word about himself and
[1:01:00] so brother Ram said he would look at the
[1:01:02] word to see what he must fulfill and so
[1:01:05] we realize that as the Bride of Jesus
[1:01:07] Christ being the final voice to the
[1:01:10] final age that we realize that we're
[1:01:13] literally right at the end of the age
[1:01:17] the layout of seal will go right on into
[1:01:18] the tribulation period but we realize
[1:01:21] that this bright age that we're living
[1:01:23] in is the maturity of the Bride is it's
[1:01:26] not an age it's an age within an age but
[1:01:28] let me just say this you it's a sign of
[1:01:30] the maturity of the Bride is here not
[1:01:33] just in this church but around the world
[1:01:37] Hallelujah and we're preparing for the
[1:01:39] coming of the Lord so what we are
[1:01:41] witnessing even among us we're
[1:01:44] witnessing fulfillment after fulfillment
[1:01:47] take place time has intercepted with
[1:01:51] prophecy so quickly brother man would
[1:01:54] say he said it's happening so fast out
[1:01:57] there on that desert he said it's
[1:01:58] accumulating so fast you can't keep up
[1:02:01] with it because the seals were being
[1:02:03] revealed so those are some of the
[1:02:05] thoughts that I want to I want to to
[1:02:07] share with you this evening brother bman
[1:02:10] says in countdown which is an important
[1:02:12] sermon he said oh God and he's praying
[1:02:15] just before he preaches oh God let us be
[1:02:18] counted worthy through the blood of
[1:02:21] Jesus no Meritus of our own do we claim
[1:02:27] but through his merits may we worthily
[1:02:31] to stand at that day as we confess our
[1:02:34] wrongs and desire to stand in his
[1:02:38] righteousness with the great Prophet
[1:02:40] Daniel and all those that who will stand
[1:02:43] when the records are given until then
[1:02:46] Lord make us instruments in your hand
[1:02:49] make us ears instruments this morning of
[1:02:53] the hearing of the word
[1:02:54] make my lips instruments to speak it for
[1:02:58] we ask it in Jesus name May our
[1:03:04] understanding understand the will of
[1:03:09] God I think that's a phenomenal
[1:03:13] prayer a phenomenal prayer you'll
[1:03:17] understand it more as we
[1:03:18] go now he would State make a statement I
[1:03:22] challenge you to believe
[1:03:25] that Jesus Christ is revealed in the
[1:03:28] form of the son of man in human
[1:03:32] flesh through the bride's
[1:03:39] body if we could ask
[1:03:42] ourselves challenge ourself may we see
[1:03:45] him even Among Us that's
[1:03:48] right brother Rand would use the term
[1:03:51] and he would go from science he would
[1:03:53] say that they they're saying be because
[1:03:56] there's an atomic clock which they call
[1:03:58] the end of the world and he said at that
[1:04:02] point in the late 50s early 60s said it
[1:04:05] was three minutes to
[1:04:08] midnight I I read an article the other
[1:04:10] day that said we're about 18
[1:04:15] seconds before
[1:04:18] midnight brother Rand would make this
[1:04:20] statement he says now in shalom he said
[1:04:24] now good morning means
[1:04:27] peace darkness is gathering what's it
[1:04:31] gathering for to show light Isaiah 60
[1:04:35] and verse one Rise and Shine for the
[1:04:38] light is come to you that's the reason I
[1:04:42] can say shalom the light has come to you
[1:04:46] God's peace to the elected woman to the
[1:04:50] elected lady those who God before the
[1:04:54] foundation of the world called out on
[1:04:58] and ordained to
[1:05:00] that I want you to just think once it
[1:05:04] was a thought with God then it was words
[1:05:07] with a prophet but you're said it in
[1:05:09] human flesh
[1:05:13] now and maybe there are times that you
[1:05:15] think well I'm not doing anything
[1:05:17] Supernatural Well maybe this service
[1:05:19] will help you with it you are the word
[1:05:22] living in flesh
[1:05:27] he says now the rest of them will never
[1:05:29] see it they'll never know nothing about
[1:05:31] it the Bible said so and Jesus said no
[1:05:35] man can come to me except my father draw
[1:05:39] him first and he said all that the
[1:05:43] father has given me will
[1:05:48] come God's not going to lose
[1:05:53] one
[1:05:56] he said when we see Darkness settling
[1:06:00] Darkness just before the day we know
[1:06:03] that the morning star is hanging Yonder
[1:06:05] to introduce the coming Sun that's when
[1:06:09] the Morning Star shines it's it's it's
[1:06:13] going between It's always
[1:06:17] darkest just a few minutes before the
[1:06:22] day the blackout comes the moon fails to
[1:06:25] shine the darkest before the day is
[1:06:29] because
[1:06:31] light is pressing the
[1:06:36] darkness but the Morning Star comes out
[1:06:39] and says good
[1:06:41] morning
[1:06:44] Shalom Hallelujah I like that don't
[1:06:47] you forgive me I just have several
[1:06:50] quotes I want to lay to you just to
[1:06:51] catch your mind he says he says now now
[1:06:55] in Shalom he says now the
[1:06:57] Symphony of God's Great drama that he's
[1:07:02] playing it changes him and he said his
[1:07:05] Symphony at is at the Junctions the
[1:07:09] composer and those who are interested I
[1:07:13] like how he says that the
[1:07:16] composer and those who are interested
[1:07:20] listen for the
[1:07:22] change so because we are
[1:07:26] [Music]
[1:07:28] interested we're listening for the
[1:07:32] change don't you love
[1:07:35] him he said God's great mystery he said
[1:07:39] it's a secret he had kept this secret
[1:07:43] nobody know nothing about it even the
[1:07:46] angels didn't understand
[1:07:49] it he didn't reveal it that's the reason
[1:07:52] under the Sabbath mystery when the
[1:07:54] seventh seal was opened there was
[1:07:57] silence Jesus when he was on the earth
[1:08:01] they wanted to know when he would
[1:08:03] come and he said it's not even the son
[1:08:08] himself don't know when it's coming
[1:08:11] think about
[1:08:13] that when it's going to happen see God
[1:08:17] has this all to
[1:08:19] himself it's a secret and that's the
[1:08:23] reason and there was silence in heaven
[1:08:25] for a space of a half an hour seven
[1:08:28] Thunders uttered their voices which you
[1:08:31] know that's the voice of
[1:08:33] God and he said and he said and John was
[1:08:37] forbidden to write it the coming of the
[1:08:40] Lord and he said that's one thing that
[1:08:43] hasn't been revealed as of yet when he
[1:08:45] will or how he will come and when he
[1:08:48] will come it's a good thing that he
[1:08:52] doesn't he has showed or even revealed
[1:08:56] it even in type that is in the Bible he
[1:08:59] said therefore the entire Bible is the
[1:09:03] revelation of God's mystery in Christ am
[1:09:09] and he says
[1:09:10] H I like brother Brams
[1:09:14] H the entire Bible is an expression of
[1:09:19] one goal that God had one purpose he
[1:09:24] wanted to achieve in the entire Bible
[1:09:27] and all the acts of the Believers in the
[1:09:31] Bible has been a
[1:09:35] type amen an expressing of what God's
[1:09:39] Great goal is and now in this last age
[1:09:44] he has revealed
[1:09:46] it he's revealed it he saved it for
[1:09:51] you than Lord if you you think about all
[1:09:54] the schools and all the theologians and
[1:09:57] all of the trying to understand the code
[1:10:00] of the scriptures and the mysteries of
[1:10:03] God and God hid it from
[1:10:06] them God just hides it right in plain
[1:10:10] sight and he takes a little Kentucky
[1:10:13] preacher that's right with hardly any
[1:10:17] education with hand and totes and all
[1:10:20] different kind of things and takes him
[1:10:22] from a background that nobody would want
[1:10:24] to have a part of carrying water to a
[1:10:27] steel that didn't offend
[1:10:31] God that didn't offend God come down in
[1:10:34] a tree and said never never drink or
[1:10:37] smoke or defile your body I have a work
[1:10:39] for you to do where was the water going
[1:10:42] to a
[1:10:45] steel what was you doing when God spoke
[1:10:48] to
[1:10:49] you where was you at when God began to
[1:10:52] deal with you in your life
[1:10:54] I'll tell you most of us were lost and
[1:10:57] alienated from the kingdom of
[1:11:02] God but God rich in
[1:11:04] [Applause]
[1:11:08] Mercy we didn't even know who we
[1:11:11] were we just we just were trying to find
[1:11:14] something searching something out there
[1:11:16] was a deep that was calling to the deep
[1:11:19] and there was nothing in life that
[1:11:22] seemed to satisfy us right trying this
[1:11:25] and trying this and trying this and
[1:11:27] trying this but one day you heard an
[1:11:29] eagle
[1:11:30] scream and that eagle screamed over top
[1:11:33] of you and you said that's
[1:11:40] me the scripture says in second Peter
[1:11:43] chapter 1 verse
[1:11:45] 16 I think this is powerful how he says
[1:11:48] it for we have not followed cunningly
[1:11:52] devis Fables
[1:11:54] when we made known unto you the power
[1:11:56] and the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:11:59] but were eyewitnesses of his magesty for
[1:12:03] he received from God the Father honor
[1:12:05] and
[1:12:06] Glory when there was such a voice to him
[1:12:09] from the excellent Glory this is my
[1:12:12] beloved Son in whom I am well
[1:12:16] pleased and this voice which came from
[1:12:19] heaven we
[1:12:21] heard and when we were with him in the
[1:12:23] Holy
[1:12:24] Mountain we have also a more sure word
[1:12:28] of Prophecy that's when until you do
[1:12:31] well that you take heed as unto a light
[1:12:34] that shineth in a dark place unto the
[1:12:36] day Dawn and the day star arising your
[1:12:39] hearts knowing this first that no
[1:12:43] Prophecy of the scripture is of any
[1:12:47] private
[1:12:51] interpretation man can interpret
[1:12:55] it God is his own
[1:13:01] interpreter God bless you brother John
[1:13:03] let me just say this you you can't make
[1:13:05] the word fulfill
[1:13:09] itself I don't care how high you jump
[1:13:12] you can't make the Rapture happen but
[1:13:14] it'll be right on
[1:13:17] time the resurrection you could go and
[1:13:20] call you could go call them call him out
[1:13:22] of the grave it'll never happen but one
[1:13:27] morning the dimensions will blend and S
[1:13:31] away and if I could say it right I
[1:13:34] believe we're closer than ever
[1:13:38] before I believe Two Worlds are coming
[1:13:43] together I believe it would cause a
[1:13:46] incredible incredible desperation in our
[1:13:50] heart if we knew how close we were
[1:13:57] Israel was just
[1:14:00] attack you would had to been in a hole
[1:14:02] somewhere to have not known that but
[1:14:05] they were
[1:14:07] attack we cannot describe the incredible
[1:14:11] horror that took
[1:14:13] place
[1:14:17] amen two
[1:14:20] forces they're both screaming for the
[1:14:22] same piece of
[1:14:24] property the Temple
[1:14:27] Mount it's an Esau Jacob
[1:14:31] deal their Heritage are
[1:14:35] screaming good people on both
[1:14:39] sides but somebody's going to fulfill
[1:14:41] the word of
[1:14:44] God terror is from the
[1:14:49] devil now now let me just say as the
[1:14:51] Bride of Jesus Christ we too are in a
[1:14:56] battle we too are in a battle for the
[1:14:59] Holy
[1:15:04] Land every promise in This Book Is
[1:15:07] Ours when men are taken away and this
[1:15:10] don't work no more and the days of
[1:15:12] Miracles has passed and this ain't for
[1:15:14] us and this ain't it's all for
[1:15:16] us every promise in this book is
[1:15:21] ours and we're in a spiritual war every
[1:15:26] one of us fighting against the darkness
[1:15:29] because remember the quote just said
[1:15:31] we're light pressing the
[1:15:36] darkness and so it's an
[1:15:39] enemy that would try to destroy Israel
[1:15:43] and destroy the people of God there
[1:15:46] remember they're God's
[1:15:50] people and and I want to just tell you
[1:15:52] they're they not going to
[1:15:54] [Applause]
[1:15:56] lose they're not going to lose now I got
[1:16:00] a further part of that you're not going
[1:16:02] to
[1:16:03] [Applause]
[1:16:11] lose that's right listen the critics say
[1:16:15] that Jesus never came on the Earth but
[1:16:17] he
[1:16:18] did the critics said that Abraham didn't
[1:16:21] own that property but but they've got
[1:16:23] the promises of the word of God and
[1:16:26] those Scrolls we own
[1:16:29] this I want to tell the devil we all
[1:16:34] miss this says that we're the Queen of
[1:16:38] Heaven this says that we're Sons and
[1:16:40] Daughters of God this says that greater
[1:16:44] is he that is in us than he that is in
[1:16:46] the
[1:16:47] world this says that we which are alive
[1:16:50] and remain shall be caught up together
[1:16:53] with them ande the Lord in the air
[1:16:55] that's what this
[1:17:04] says the last few days of quotes have
[1:17:07] came forth from incredible
[1:17:09] leaders that says that this is the war
[1:17:12] to end all
[1:17:13] wars
[1:17:19] maybe you should not have attacked us
[1:17:23] amen the gates of hell are now
[1:17:28] opened was a quote that was
[1:17:31] made by President Biden the other
[1:17:35] day thankful I can actually quote
[1:17:46] him he had met with gold in my ear
[1:17:48] literally days before Yan
[1:17:51] Kipper the young Kipper
[1:17:55] war and they were standing there knowing
[1:17:58] that the enemy was breathing
[1:18:00] down and the enemy is always trying to
[1:18:03] destroy
[1:18:05] Israel trying to destroy you
[1:18:10] personally and he was standing there
[1:18:12] beside of her and she made an incredible
[1:18:16] statement she
[1:18:18] said you see we have nowhere to go
[1:18:23] that's
[1:18:27] right we will never go back to those gas
[1:18:31] Chambers ever again that's
[1:18:37] right those threats continue to come to
[1:18:40] destroy
[1:18:42] them God help our brothers and
[1:18:46] sisters let me just let let us just
[1:18:49] remind ourself just for a moment
[1:18:51] that the the same God that spoke to
[1:18:55] Abraham can you count the sand of the
[1:18:58] sea it was too overwhelming he said no
[1:19:03] now he's standing there trious he said
[1:19:06] can you count the sand of the sea so
[1:19:09] shall thy seed be that's his natural
[1:19:12] seed and then he asked him to count the
[1:19:15] stars of the
[1:19:17] heaven and he
[1:19:19] said so shall thy seat be
[1:19:25] Now understand god'll never forget one
[1:19:28] of them and he'll never forget one of
[1:19:35] them and I don't care what the enemy
[1:19:38] does in that dark Forex of what he is
[1:19:41] capable of doing he can't
[1:19:48] win now I I just want to I just want to
[1:19:51] talk to you just for a little bit if
[1:19:52] that's okay yeah folks we're on a
[1:19:55] journey yes sir we're on a
[1:19:58] journey we're we're either destined for
[1:20:02] a body
[1:20:04] change or we're destined for a
[1:20:07] tribulation
[1:20:10] period the message has prepared
[1:20:13] us for the Rapture and identified us for
[1:20:17] the Rapture now you know you can't make
[1:20:20] yourself believe it right amen you can't
[1:20:25] make yourself believe it maybe even when
[1:20:28] you came in there were people that were
[1:20:30] friends of yours that came in with you
[1:20:32] but after a while they just kind of
[1:20:33] trickled off but something held
[1:20:38] you something held you and it held you
[1:20:42] because you can't hold on to
[1:20:46] yourself now I I want to explain to you
[1:20:49] what held you before you were
[1:20:55] born before the Earth was even
[1:20:59] created God deposited a seed on the
[1:21:03] inside of you before the foundation of
[1:21:06] the
[1:21:07] world so before you were even a thought
[1:21:10] in
[1:21:11] humanity you were in
[1:21:13] [Music]
[1:21:14] [Applause]
[1:21:21] God
[1:21:24] you say well brother Ron it just seems
[1:21:26] like every force from hell is trying to
[1:21:28] destroy you you ought to be praising the
[1:21:31] Lord and instead of giving yourself a
[1:21:34] pity party start worshiping
[1:21:39] God because Satan would destroy you if
[1:21:43] he
[1:21:48] could now you see we had a prophet that
[1:21:53] fulfill Malachi 4 5 and
[1:21:57] 6 God can't destroy the Earth until as
[1:22:01] he sends the the gentile people a
[1:22:05] messenger and that Messenger will call
[1:22:09] us call us out of denominational
[1:22:13] systems and call us not just to be a
[1:22:17] kingdom but call us back to the
[1:22:21] word it'll call us back to the word and
[1:22:24] we'll see ourself in the word the same
[1:22:28] as Jesus looked at the word to see what
[1:22:31] he must
[1:22:33] fulfill and maybe you're maybe this is
[1:22:36] one of your first times hearing this but
[1:22:37] listen Jesus knew the
[1:22:40] scriptures as Jonas was in the belly of
[1:22:44] the whale or
[1:22:47] hell so must the son of man
[1:22:51] be he was but look at the scripture said
[1:22:54] I will not suffer mine Holy One to see
[1:22:58] corruption based on Prophecy he could
[1:23:01] stand there and say destroy this Temple
[1:23:04] and in three days I raise it up
[1:23:09] [Applause]
[1:23:12] again he could stand and look at the
[1:23:15] word and say I am my father are
[1:23:18] [Applause]
[1:23:20] one he can look at Behold a virgin shall
[1:23:26] conceive and Jesus knew where he came
[1:23:29] from he wasn't part Mary and part God he
[1:23:33] was all
[1:23:34] [Applause]
[1:23:36] [Music]
[1:23:39] God are you with me
[1:23:45] now
[1:23:48] now God had to send a
[1:23:51] messenger no knowing that America had
[1:23:54] been raised up to fulfill
[1:23:57] scripture policeman of the world and she
[1:23:59] has done all of that she's been a she's
[1:24:02] been a power for
[1:24:05] Rome we see that we we can see the
[1:24:09] purple we can see the purple dress we
[1:24:11] can you know we can see Sodom among us
[1:24:14] and we can see the corruption in our
[1:24:18] government you know brother R said he
[1:24:20] could put an Abraham Lincoln and a
[1:24:22] George Washington in every County it
[1:24:24] wouldn't turn it
[1:24:26] around Billy Graham declared in the 90s
[1:24:30] he said America has went too far and
[1:24:34] there's no way back for it messenger of
[1:24:37] Sodom would make that
[1:24:39] statement I found it interesting I found
[1:24:42] that this
[1:24:46] week you see you see all of the prophecy
[1:24:51] that has been a foretold for all of
[1:24:54] these thousands of years is now
[1:24:57] literally
[1:24:58] happening in our
[1:25:01] lives and you say well brother Ron I'm a
[1:25:03] nobody well let me just mention a few
[1:25:06] nobodies there was a man named
[1:25:13] shamgar and Satan even remembers
[1:25:16] him there was a man named
[1:25:19] Joseph that told his brothers a a dream
[1:25:23] yeah and he told them about a kingdom
[1:25:26] rise and how he would be lifted up and
[1:25:29] how even the brothers would bow and in
[1:25:32] worship and then they they sold him for
[1:25:35] pieces of
[1:25:36] silver told a lie that he had been
[1:25:39] killed
[1:25:40] destroyed and he goes and he's in Egypt
[1:25:43] and they tell a lie on him he winds up
[1:25:45] in
[1:25:46] prison two
[1:25:47] men with him and he he tells their dream
[1:25:51] then he winds up and and he he fulfills
[1:25:55] the vision of even that pharaoh and he
[1:25:58] becomes to the right hand of
[1:26:01] pharaoh you'd never hear Joseph saying
[1:26:04] I'm portraying Jesus
[1:26:08] Christ but that's what he was
[1:26:12] doing God was prophesying in Joseph's
[1:26:17] life it's going to be good you just hang
[1:26:20] with me Joseph in a prison for
[1:26:24] years but he was fulfilling the
[1:26:28] word Joseph standing there and Haring
[1:26:32] all the Garners of Egypt and filling
[1:26:35] them full he was portraying Jesus
[1:26:40] Christ with his brothers com and and
[1:26:43] Benjamin comes and his father
[1:26:47] comes he was portraying Jesus
[1:26:51] Christ
[1:26:53] married to a gentile
[1:26:56] wife he was portraying Jesus
[1:27:01] Christ but nowhere does he
[1:27:04] say I'm living out
[1:27:08] prophecy he didn't have a book of
[1:27:20] Joseph David
[1:27:24] taking care of
[1:27:25] sheep doesn't realize he's fulfilling
[1:27:31] prophecy he doesn't realize God's got a
[1:27:34] vision it's going to come right through
[1:27:35] his life he's Ruddy he's red hair is red
[1:27:41] he's he's he's more of a handsome man
[1:27:44] than he is a warrior he's
[1:27:48] a he's a
[1:27:51] musician
[1:27:53] he's a
[1:27:54] musician and by his music and being in
[1:27:57] the presence of God it drives away
[1:28:01] demons War goes on and he comes with a
[1:28:06] sling not with an ecclesiastical
[1:28:10] vest not with some doctorate degree but
[1:28:13] he takes a sling and he picks up five
[1:28:16] smooth
[1:28:21] stones question came to me this week
[1:28:24] what about all these people that are
[1:28:25] being murdered and being destroyed isn't
[1:28:28] that horrible what's going on you need
[1:28:30] to read the
[1:28:33] scriptures God destroyed 85,000 in one
[1:28:38] day one day hail
[1:28:42] stones and five of those stones David
[1:28:44] picked
[1:28:46] up those stones had been used before and
[1:28:50] he picks up those five stones
[1:28:54] and it destroys
[1:28:57] Goliath David becomes
[1:29:00] king David becomes
[1:29:03] rejected a man walks up and spits in his
[1:29:06] face over and over again there's nothing
[1:29:10] more anything more reputable than you
[1:29:12] can do than to Hawk and spit in a man's
[1:29:16] face and one of David's men says let me
[1:29:20] have his head he said no let him alone
[1:29:22] that's right that's am on this is bigger
[1:29:25] than me and you that's right cuz Jesus
[1:29:29] would be spit
[1:29:30] in Jesus would be
[1:29:33] rejected and here he was a king that was
[1:29:37] being
[1:29:41] rejected nowhere do you hear him say I'm
[1:29:44] fulfilling the vision of what Jesus is
[1:29:46] going to be
[1:29:50] like amen
[1:29:56] I'm sure
[1:29:58] Jonah's Journey was pretty
[1:30:04] rough sister Jara he realized that as
[1:30:08] they were throwing things off of the
[1:30:10] boat for these men to be
[1:30:13] saved I have to say I become accountable
[1:30:16] I'm the
[1:30:17] man I'm the
[1:30:20] man and they throw him off of the boat
[1:30:23] yeah well God's got transportation for
[1:30:28] him he just had to get him off the
[1:30:37] boat he's got Transportation he created
[1:30:41] but it was a great well a great fish
[1:30:44] that's
[1:30:46] right he created a great
[1:30:50] fish and that great fish no doubt had a
[1:30:53] lot of seaweed in
[1:30:56] there because brother R said Jonah was
[1:30:59] covered in
[1:31:01] seaweed and Jonah it literally had an
[1:31:04] oxygen tin in it
[1:31:08] obviously cuz they're at the bottom of
[1:31:11] the ocean and God provides for
[1:31:14] him three days
[1:31:19] oxygen cuz first of all he's got to get
[1:31:22] Jonah
[1:31:23] right he's got to get him to
[1:31:26] repent for his own self-will he's got to
[1:31:29] getting prepared when you get on ground
[1:31:32] you got to preach what I'm telling you
[1:31:33] to
[1:31:36] preach some people don't understand
[1:31:38] brother brandham brother brandham was
[1:31:39] under the instruction of the angel of
[1:31:43] God he was not a political guy he was a
[1:31:47] messenger from the Throne of
[1:31:50] God to get you
[1:31:53] ready don't try to polish him up don't
[1:31:56] try to make it right just believe
[1:31:59] [Applause]
[1:32:01] it just believe
[1:32:05] it God had to get him to where he would
[1:32:07] say exactly what he wanted him to
[1:32:13] say Jonah found himself turning Every
[1:32:16] Which away because the scripture said if
[1:32:18] you could get your face toward the
[1:32:20] temple he'll hear your prayer and he
[1:32:23] would turn and turn and turn and turn to
[1:32:26] get himself toward the
[1:32:28] temple because he knew that he was now
[1:32:30] in a
[1:32:31] spot that he couldn't do nothing to help
[1:32:40] himself but being
[1:32:42] that Tarsus believed in a fish
[1:32:47] God it had to be an incredible sight
[1:32:51] when when this great fish rolls up on
[1:32:54] the beach and beaches itself and opens
[1:32:56] its mouth a prophet runs
[1:33:00] [Music]
[1:33:04] out oh what a
[1:33:10] paradox believe a sign ought to take
[1:33:12] that on for a while if they want
[1:33:13] something to do they ought to take that
[1:33:14] on for a
[1:33:16] while nowh does he say well I'm
[1:33:19] fulfilling what Jesus is going to be
[1:33:23] like Ruth did not know Esther did not
[1:33:27] know Tamar did not know Sarah did not
[1:33:31] know that they were typing
[1:33:33] [Music]
[1:33:38] you so look at your
[1:33:41] type look at your
[1:33:44] type you overcame
[1:33:47] then you'll overcome
[1:33:50] now
[1:34:01] each one of these played a part of the
[1:34:03] attributes of the coming
[1:34:06] Christ I don't know if you understand
[1:34:08] this or not but you're playing a part of
[1:34:10] redemption right
[1:34:12] now you're part of the vision of the
[1:34:14] open book if I can just come to you just
[1:34:17] a
[1:34:19] moment in the book of the Lamb's
[1:34:24] Book can I just type it just for a
[1:34:26] moment amen and it comes to a name
[1:34:29] called India
[1:34:32] Spencer
[1:34:35] Hallelujah now you can't see your name
[1:34:38] there but God knows you'll be
[1:34:40] there so he watched over your natural
[1:34:43] seed now I could have called 200 and
[1:34:45] something names here but I'm I'm calling
[1:34:46] her will you stay with me well that's
[1:34:49] your granddaughter well okay yeah
[1:34:54] is but God watched over her and there
[1:34:57] was nothing could to stop her from
[1:35:05] coming how many of you
[1:35:08] have let's just say on the internet have
[1:35:11] flought the enemy that said you're not
[1:35:13] going to make
[1:35:16] it well if God couldn't stop your
[1:35:19] getting
[1:35:20] here
[1:35:24] and God watched over all the way to get
[1:35:26] you
[1:35:29] here he knew that you would arrive so
[1:35:31] you're now the vision
[1:35:38] living now that don't make you stuff
[1:35:41] shirt or I'm so and so that ought to
[1:35:43] make you more humble than ever
[1:35:46] before we're none of us are anything
[1:35:50] without the grace of Jesus Jesus
[1:35:57] Christ so
[1:35:59] India we're a part of God's
[1:36:06] Vision God met him in a
[1:36:09] cave his message was to come out of her
[1:36:11] my
[1:36:12] people you made a journey to find
[1:36:15] truth God gave you a guide to lead you
[1:36:18] and guide you even when you couldn't see
[1:36:22] and when you come to the message you
[1:36:24] begin to identify where you came
[1:36:26] from and you realize that your family
[1:36:29] tree is not so
[1:36:32] important I want to hurt your feelings
[1:36:34] now some of us come out of some really
[1:36:37] rough stuff but they were just the
[1:36:41] natural but you came from
[1:36:45] God you came from God through your
[1:36:48] natural family you inherited a lot of
[1:36:50] bad stuff yeah but you actually came
[1:36:53] from
[1:36:55] God and this message tells you where you
[1:36:58] came
[1:37:00] from and because of the seed that's in
[1:37:03] you you go that's absolutely the truth
[1:37:06] that's right when other people go I
[1:37:09] don't like that I don't I can't stand
[1:37:11] that I don't like that and you go what's
[1:37:13] wrong with
[1:37:15] you can't you see acts 238 can't you see
[1:37:19] one God Amen
[1:37:22] Hey listen once you see Jesus Christ you
[1:37:24] can't see nothing
[1:37:30] else once you see you're a part of the
[1:37:33] word you can't see nothing
[1:37:35] [Applause]
[1:37:40] else go back what would I go back
[1:37:50] to
[1:37:54] brother randam I want you to remember
[1:37:57] time intercepting with
[1:37:59] prophecy these messages are more than
[1:38:02] just man's
[1:38:07] thoughts they are more than just man's
[1:38:09] thoughts this is more than just a
[1:38:11] conjecture of a
[1:38:13] man so the Angels meeting with him to
[1:38:16] deliver messages at certain times in
[1:38:19] chronological order
[1:38:22] and brother Bram would say you're not
[1:38:23] feeding on the mind of a man but you're
[1:38:24] feeding on the body word of the son of a
[1:38:26] man so you're not feeding on the
[1:38:28] personality of brother
[1:38:30] brandom but you're actually feeding on
[1:38:33] Christ the word now what that's going to
[1:38:35] do with you is you're not going to have
[1:38:37] brother brandom's
[1:38:41] nature and neither are you going to get
[1:38:43] my nature but the word deposited on the
[1:38:47] inside of you will produce Jesus
[1:38:50] Christ
[1:38:53] so brother random would walk out and he
[1:38:54] would begin to preach the way of a true
[1:39:00] prophet and then he would explain to us
[1:39:03] in the way of a true Prophet what a
[1:39:05] prophet's job
[1:39:07] is and he would take us back to
[1:39:11] Amos and he would talk to us about how
[1:39:13] Amos came and he narrowed his eyes at
[1:39:15] the sin and then later hundreds of years
[1:39:18] later Jesus would stand on the same Hill
[1:39:25] am he would preach a sermons and I'm
[1:39:27] just going to go through here what is
[1:39:29] the attraction on the
[1:39:31] mountain and brother Brandon would come
[1:39:34] and Jesus is fulfilling one prophecy
[1:39:38] after another go get the cult the fall
[1:39:40] of an ass it's got to be a it's got to
[1:39:43] be an animal that's never been rode by
[1:39:44] man before it can't be a denominational
[1:39:50] system got to be totally impossible for
[1:39:52] that animal to be ridden by natural man
[1:39:55] so for that animal that's never been
[1:39:57] rode on before to be totally quiet now I
[1:40:00] want to just think about this for a
[1:40:01] moment for Jesus to get on that animal
[1:40:04] yes sir and to ride in the chaos of
[1:40:07] people screaming and pulling leaves and
[1:40:10] throwing their coats down and hosana to
[1:40:13] the king there was an anointing hit in
[1:40:16] that
[1:40:17] area because the King was
[1:40:19] coming
[1:40:21] they would reject him and crucify him in
[1:40:23] a week but the king had arrived prophecy
[1:40:27] had been made
[1:40:32] flesh cost them to
[1:40:35] hush cost them to not worship if I do
[1:40:39] that the rocks will cry out
[1:40:43] Amen brother brm would use this
[1:40:45] statement he said prophecy was becoming
[1:40:49] history
[1:40:52] and he would also use that same type of
[1:40:54] statement when it come to
[1:40:56] Sunset after the seals were revealed
[1:41:00] prophecy is now
[1:41:03] history there will come a time when we
[1:41:06] leave the Earth that all the
[1:41:11] prophecy that is
[1:41:13] rolled and now you're
[1:41:16] living will change in the moment in the
[1:41:18] twinkle of an eye and all be his
[1:41:28] strength I think it's interesting that
[1:41:30] brother Brandon would preach godhead and
[1:41:32] revealed in Simplicity and he would
[1:41:34] explain who Jesus really is then he
[1:41:37] would preach the
[1:41:38] breach because now God was going to
[1:41:41] reveal the Mysteries to the Bride of
[1:41:43] Jesus
[1:41:44] Christ and the bride would be the only
[1:41:46] group that would hear
[1:41:49] it this is is going to the breach is
[1:41:52] between the church ages and their
[1:41:55] dispensations and the
[1:41:56] bride and only the Queen of Heaven is
[1:41:59] actually going to say that's a
[1:42:02] truth because in the seals it's going to
[1:42:05] expose who Satan is and it's going to
[1:42:08] expose the denominational systems and
[1:42:11] it's going to expose the mystery of
[1:42:13] iniquity that even is working amongst us
[1:42:15] and it's going to expose every evil
[1:42:18] spirit that there's ever been it's going
[1:42:20] to expose all of that but it's going to
[1:42:23] also reveal who you
[1:42:29] are are you with me are you staying with
[1:42:32] me I'm I'm
[1:42:33] sorry he would preach a sermon the
[1:42:35] Mighty God
[1:42:37] unveiled the very deity of Jesus
[1:42:43] Christ he's not three he's not
[1:42:48] two he's one
[1:42:51] I think it's incredible that brother
[1:42:53] brandham in in these incredible sermons
[1:42:56] would say it
[1:42:58] so
[1:43:00] simply until a child could understand it
[1:43:04] let me let me give you an instance I
[1:43:06] went to a play the other day he would
[1:43:08] say and he said it would be the same
[1:43:12] person playing different
[1:43:18] parts and he said they just changed
[1:43:21] their
[1:43:24] mask it's not a bunch of different
[1:43:27] gods it's a same
[1:43:30] God changing
[1:43:41] mask that's not too hard to see is it I
[1:43:45] love it how he says would you like to
[1:43:47] know how the world was created I'm going
[1:43:48] to paraphrase right now and he said the
[1:43:53] logos he said he spoke out of it and he
[1:43:56] said he believed his own
[1:43:58] word and he spoke let there be a
[1:44:02] son and the son came into existence you
[1:44:06] realize what a phenomena the sun
[1:44:09] is that's
[1:44:12] right one of these idiots said they were
[1:44:14] going to fly into the Sun Well try that
[1:44:19] out try that
[1:44:28] out I'm sorry I was I was S I was
[1:44:32] sitting in the doctor's office the other
[1:44:34] day getting shots in my knees and I I
[1:44:36] just heard a deal it was on the radio
[1:44:38] and I heard a deal that there was a man
[1:44:40] spending $2 million a year on health
[1:44:43] care and he was he was he was literally
[1:44:47] he was in his 40s and he said I'm going
[1:44:49] to live for
[1:44:54] immortality okay and he's spending $2
[1:44:56] million a year on a team of doctors
[1:44:59] Brother Ray that's watching his organs
[1:45:02] and I'm just going to say it watching
[1:45:05] his release of his bowels and his water
[1:45:08] and making sure that his organs are
[1:45:10] working well he takes 111 pills a
[1:45:16] day I'm not doing any of
[1:45:19] that I'm not doing any of
[1:45:22] that but I'm going to live
[1:45:48] forever I've done got I've done come to
[1:45:50] a conclusion all brother on all that's
[1:45:52] Hocus Pocus well stick
[1:45:55] around maybe you'll see me just before I
[1:46:00] go maybe you'll see me just before I go
[1:46:02] I'm going to look younger than that guy
[1:46:04] right there take your glasses off
[1:46:07] Andrew that come here
[1:46:12] Andrew I'm going look a lot like this
[1:46:14] guy right here and he's not going to
[1:46:16] have any gray in it'll be all
[1:46:19] right
[1:46:21] [Applause]
[1:46:23] I'm going to get a body
[1:46:25] change that's right and if you can hear
[1:46:28] this voice it's going to be
[1:46:30] me but it's going to be the word living
[1:46:33] in human
[1:46:49] flesh
[1:46:54] well brother Ron I I well maybe
[1:46:57] I'll just catch you just for a few
[1:46:59] minutes maybe I can just tell you some
[1:47:01] things that you really will believe as
[1:47:03] it was in the days of Noah so shall it
[1:47:07] be in the days of the coming of the son
[1:47:09] of man and he describes what the
[1:47:12] conditions of that age
[1:47:13] is do we have those same
[1:47:19] conditions
[1:47:26] sir as an ni as a fig Leaf putteth forth
[1:47:29] her budding leaves you know summer is
[1:47:33] night and brother brandham
[1:47:36] said keep your eyes on Israel that's
[1:47:40] your time
[1:47:43] clock and so she has been a nation now
[1:47:47] since about 46 48 that's right
[1:47:52] and God gathered them all back
[1:47:55] home he gathered them
[1:47:58] home there's hundreds and even millions
[1:48:01] are scattered throughout the Earth yet
[1:48:03] that's right who supports
[1:48:09] Israel but she has had her
[1:48:13] flag
[1:48:14] now this is the first time in 2500 years
[1:48:18] she's had her flag that's right there's
[1:48:21] a reason that she's
[1:48:24] there amen right God forced her to go
[1:48:29] home he forced her to go home and the
[1:48:33] whole world she went back to a land that
[1:48:35] nobody wanted her to have they still
[1:48:38] don't want her to
[1:48:39] have it is a fulfillment of
[1:48:45] Prophecy now you may not believe us but
[1:48:48] if you can if you're going to stay and
[1:48:49] miss the Rapture there's two prophets
[1:48:52] that are coming
[1:48:56] to they're
[1:49:03] coming they're coming and they're going
[1:49:06] to preach the message that you've
[1:49:11] heard except it won't be
[1:49:14] seals it'll be
[1:49:19] trumpets that's they won't be liked
[1:49:22] either but they'll be killed in the
[1:49:25] street but God raised them back
[1:49:29] up and let me just say there will be
[1:49:35] 144,000 believe the message in
[1:49:39] Israel so they're not going to lose this
[1:49:49] war
[1:49:57] brother Ron what do you make of hundreds
[1:49:59] of thousands of people going to the
[1:50:00] streets and protesting and all that it's
[1:50:03] the
[1:50:04] drums of the war
[1:50:08] cry it's the drums of the war
[1:50:12] cry prophecy is going to be fulfilled
[1:50:15] amen and people are getting under
[1:50:18] tribulation anointing
[1:50:20] that's
[1:50:22] right now can I get just a few more
[1:50:26] minutes when brother Brandon was on the
[1:50:30] scene King Jesus was
[1:50:34] here but King El was Presley
[1:50:38] King and he was anointed from the region
[1:50:41] of the darkness and rock and roll was
[1:50:45] just the Beatles came under that same
[1:50:49] inspiration
[1:50:51] those those people went under that same
[1:50:53] inspiration there was an anointing hit
[1:50:55] the world and the bop and the music
[1:50:58] begin to go because remember Satan is
[1:51:02] the is the song leader that was in
[1:51:05] heaven and so he uses
[1:51:08] music and Elvis Presley standing there
[1:51:11] had sold his
[1:51:13] Birthright he had been a song leader in
[1:51:15] his Granddaddy's Pentecostal church and
[1:51:19] felt the whole Holy Ghost but he
[1:51:21] perverted that gift and he began to sing
[1:51:25] but even in his concerts this is what
[1:51:28] fools a whole lot of people even in his
[1:51:30] concerts he could sing Amazing Grace and
[1:51:34] thousands of people could come under
[1:51:36] conviction and he would even stand there
[1:51:38] and weep and cry cuz he knew those two
[1:51:43] Dimensions women wouldn't satisfy his
[1:51:47] soul money wouldn't satisfy Soul drugs
[1:51:51] wouldn't satisfy Soul cuz he knew what
[1:51:55] reality
[1:52:00] was are you with
[1:52:03] me now that just shows you the influence
[1:52:06] of a
[1:52:12] spirit I don't know about you but
[1:52:15] sometimes I stand in
[1:52:17] awe of how corrupt our government has
[1:52:20] come in the last 15
[1:52:24] years and
[1:52:26] listen no matter no matter if they were
[1:52:29] independent they're
[1:52:31] corrupt don't get your eyes on all of
[1:52:33] that all of that
[1:52:35] business brother brandham explains it to
[1:52:38] us it's of the
[1:52:41] devil
[1:52:43] you I know you guys live in the real
[1:52:47] world and people either want to talk
[1:52:51] sports or the natural world or they'll
[1:52:54] talk
[1:52:55] politics and you can sit in a restaurant
[1:52:58] we just did the other day Connie and I
[1:53:00] sit in a
[1:53:02] restaurant and people can get religious
[1:53:05] in a
[1:53:06] second cussing just a few moments ago
[1:53:09] and get religious in a
[1:53:12] second because of what's going on in
[1:53:14] Israel they can get religious in a
[1:53:18] second
[1:53:21] they can get into Political discussions
[1:53:23] and be
[1:53:26] friends and literally be in an argument
[1:53:29] you would think they hated each
[1:53:32] other what does
[1:53:37] that brother on but when Abraham Lincoln
[1:53:39] was here you know he was a mighty man he
[1:53:42] was a phenomenal man do you know that
[1:53:45] they tried to kill him 18 different
[1:53:49] times s on his way to the White House
[1:53:53] from
[1:53:55] Chicago he hired the
[1:53:58] pieron right to watch over him to get
[1:54:02] him he did not travel straight from
[1:54:04] Chicago to
[1:54:07] Washington cuz they would have murdered
[1:54:09] him he went through all different kind
[1:54:11] of routes to get him to Washington
[1:54:14] knowing he was going to be killed he
[1:54:15] said it over and over they're going to
[1:54:17] kill
[1:54:18] me
[1:54:24] yeah but we held his him as an
[1:54:27] incredible great
[1:54:29] man people don't want good

[1:55:08] a football field or a basketball field
[1:55:11] or a
[1:55:15] baseball and those people are not going
[1:55:17] to give you no money

[1:56:13] why what influence is causing you to
[1:56:15] want people to calm
[1:56:18] down
[1:56:33] well brother Ron when we get there we're
[1:56:34] going to dance on streets or go you
[1:56:36] ain't doing it
[1:56:38] here you ain't lifting and screaming
[1:56:41] your voice
[1:56:43] [Music]
[1:56:43] [Applause]
[1:56:48] here
[1:56:53] I believe in a balance I do
[1:56:56] too I really
[1:57:02] do but if people can go worship a ball
[1:57:11] game why can't we worship
[1:57:18] God
[1:57:30] with all that said I just want to make a
[1:57:33] real statement
[1:57:36] here with statements to try to stop
[1:57:39] people from
[1:57:41] worshiping that might offend
[1:57:44] me but what about offending the angel of
[1:57:48] God
[1:57:54] what about offending the angel of God so
[1:57:57] I would caution
[1:58:00] you cuz we're fulfilling prophecy
[1:58:09] here I'm
[1:58:12] sorry I just want to drop a couple more
[1:58:14] things here Revelations
[1:58:17] 101 is our day
[1:58:20] and we realize that that Revelations
[1:58:23] 10:1 is Christ The Mighty angel coming
[1:58:26] to this
[1:58:28] age that is the Heavenly Mighty
[1:58:33] Angel Revelations
[1:58:35] 107 is the Earthly
[1:58:40] messenger and they're both on the earth
[1:58:43] at the same
[1:58:46] time but the rest of Revel Gans 10 from
[1:58:50] 8 through is
[1:58:54] you eating the book living the word
[1:58:58] prophesying
[1:59:04] again so let me just say this to
[1:59:08] you we are
[1:59:12] participants of the
[1:59:18] rapture
[1:59:21] amen I don't think we can say it any
[1:59:23] better and scream any
[1:59:25] louder We Are The Living Word in
[1:59:41] flesh and Satan's done everything he can
[1:59:43] brother Charles to discredit it to
[1:59:46] destroy it to stop it
[1:59:50] to influence to distract
[1:59:53] us well how does he distract us if
[1:59:55] you're not careful you'll throw rocks at
[1:59:57] one
[1:59:58] another but if you can realize you're
[2:00:01] all on the same
[2:00:07] team you're all on the same
[2:00:10] team and if I took a picture
[2:00:13] tonight like God's going to take a
[2:00:16] panoramic
[2:00:17] picture where that Elton
[2:00:40] group I like that don't
[2:00:48] you
[2:00:50] so I'm going to I promise you I'm
[2:00:52] finishing with this
[2:00:53] thought so when I drove up in this
[2:00:56] afternoon I drove up a asphalt driveway

[2:01:01] drove up an asphalt driveway I drove by

[2:01:12] beautiful bank that's there
