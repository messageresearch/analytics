Amen. May God richly bless you. It's a great honor for me to be here again in this family reunion. &gt;&gt; And the church says, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And there where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So maybe some have never seen me, but that's just you have spiritual amnesia because we were together. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We were together. &gt;&gt; Not here before the foundation of the world. Amen. And it's a great honor to be standing. You know the the the prophet, he says there are churches, churches. &gt;&gt; You can preach with me. &gt;&gt; Brides, brides. &gt;&gt; Churches, brides, brides. &gt;&gt; But there has got to come one. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. He says there has to come a real bride. Amen. There must come one. &gt;&gt; So there's not many many bride. There's one bride. &gt;&gt; Made out of many members. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And I'm a I'm one of them. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. &gt;&gt; There's one bride. Amen. That not only has the mechanics, &gt;&gt; BUT THAT HAS THE DYNAMICS on the mechanics. &gt;&gt; Amen. That makes the church live. &gt;&gt; Amen. SO, WE DON'T SERVE A DEAD GOD. &gt;&gt; We serve a living God. Amen. &gt;&gt; The word is alive &gt;&gt; and it's a great honor to be standing before a portion of that one. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I bring you greetings on behalf of the church back home and my wife. I'm very honored and blessed to have my wife with me, Sister Anne, my oldest daughter, Jessica, and God bless them. It's always better to travel together. Amen. the the pastors, the ministers know that. So they we bring greetings and I want to personally thank you. Amen. Because through the years you have had so much love towards us. You're going to say, "Well, brother David, how?" Because you let your pastor, Brother Ron, travel overseas to be a blessing for that portion of the bride over there. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I personally with all my heart want to thank you because I know we want to keep our pastor. We love him so much. We want to have him here and when he's gone, uh, you know, but we're not selfish people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're Christians. How many Christians do we have tonight? &gt;&gt; That means to be like Christ and to live for others. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, amen. From the depths of my heart, I say thank you on behalf of the European bride are we are blessed to have true servants of God that stand for the pure word of God. So, thank you for sharing, brother Ron, brother Andrew. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and we're just, you know, we're preparing the bride because there's a five-fold ministry, says the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. for the perfecting of the saints. &gt;&gt; So, we truly want to give glory to God for the vessel that God is using. Amen. And we surely love Brother Ron with all our heart. Sister Connie, thank you for all you've done for us through the years. So I was so blessed when when when with brother Andrew when we we we we made this we started organizing this and you know brother Ron so there were some tight moments but then when I opened the door and we could see and surprise brother Ron we really say thank you Jesus amen we were praying please don't reveal that to brother Ron please don't reveal it and the Lord answers prayer and the church says amen. Amen. So, it's a great honor to be here. Amen. And we're under great expectation. I'm a nobody. Amen. I truly say that with all my heart. I'm a sinner saved by God's grace. Amen. And I just want to tell about somebody. &gt;&gt; Amen. That can save anybody. &gt;&gt; And his name is Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; So that's the doctrine I will preach tonight. Is that okay? &gt;&gt; Amen. So if I can ask you one thing, you preach with me. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't you know there's a fire of God burning. So there there's no cold. There's no ice. &gt;&gt; It's the power of God that is moving. &gt;&gt; And whatever your need is, I know the Lord directed me one way. So I said, "Lord, you know, we as as pastors, as ministers, we don't necessarily like it when God changes our plans. But then we say, Lord, it's up to you now. So, may God have his way tonight. Amen. And like the prophet would say before we read the word, he says, "What we need is a Holy Ghost atmosphere." &gt;&gt; He says, "That's right. An atmosphere where the power of God is moving, where we're in one accord, one place, gathered together under the atmosphere of expecting God to move down and do signs and wonders." &gt;&gt; How many have that desire tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. You didn't know brother David was going to preach. Well, maybe you prefer brother Andrew. And I understand. Me, too. I prefer brother Andrew, but it fell on me. But we still say serve the same God. &gt;&gt; He can use different vocal cords, but we serve a living God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he says, the prophet, let's move ourselves up into that bracket. Step up in faith. move out of these three dimensions up into the next one. So, let's lay everything aside. No matter how you how good or how bad your day was, how good, how bad your week was, LAY ASIDE EVERYTHING. This is the most important MOMENT WHEN WE COME IN THE PRESENCE OF THE ALMIGHTY God &gt;&gt; because he knows more about you than what we know about us. &gt;&gt; So, let's put aside this three dimension. and let's go in &gt;&gt; the other brackets. Amen. So, let's open up the word in Ephesians. &gt;&gt; Ephesians 6 going to start from verse 10. You can say amen when you're there. &gt;&gt; Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord. Doesn't say be strong in your own strength. &gt;&gt; And the sister says, "Well, it's only the brethren." &gt;&gt; Be strong in the Lord. &gt;&gt; From the youngest to the oldest. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because there's no Greek, there's no Jew, there's no man, there's no woman. We are one. &gt;&gt; So be strong in the Lord &gt;&gt; and in the power of his might. Put on the whole armor of God that ye may be able to stand against the viles of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all to stand, stand therefore. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. one first John 4 got three scriptures and then many more how the Lord will lead first John 4 4:4 I love that verse &gt;&gt; ye are of God &gt;&gt; that ought the pope if he had a revelation That's right. &gt;&gt; Of what this verse, little verse says, that ought to make him shout. Now, what? &gt;&gt; What about the bride? &gt;&gt; Ye are of God, &gt;&gt; brother David. Who do you think you are? &gt;&gt; Okay. God came down in our generation &gt;&gt; to reveal himself, &gt;&gt; who we were, what our true identity is. &gt;&gt; Amen. So ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them. Why? Because greater is he that is in you &gt;&gt; than he that is in the world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory, glory, hallelujah. And Ephesians 1, we'll start with verse three. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who had blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ, according as he had chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy without blame before him in love, having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, to the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he had made us accepted in the beloved. May God add the blessing to the reading of his word. Let's bow our heads for a word of prayer. Our dear heavenly father, Lord, we count it such a great honor and a privilege and we never want to take it for granted Lord to be standing on holy ground Lord to know Father there where two or three are gathered in your name you are there father Lord. So tonight Lord God as we have gathered here Lord we have many needs but Lord you know everything about us. So I pray Lord God as we have read your word. May you come down and break the bread of life to us Father. May it Lord not just be word that we hear Father. May you anoint our spiritual ears Lord God so that we can hear Lord what you say to us Father. And Lord may we have a greater love even for you Lord. And uh may we have this fellowship with you Lord that you love when you were in the Garden of Eden. You love to fellowship with Adam and Eve. And father, even tonight, you want to have fellowship with us. So Lord, as we surrender to you, I pray, Father, may you speak through the vessel. Lord God, you know your people, Father. So have your way. We pray and ask these things in the wonderful name of our Lord Jesus Christ. And the church says, &gt;&gt; "Amen and amen." You may be seated. Thank you, bro. Amen. So we read in Ephesians 1 is blessed with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places. Amen. So we have to get out of these three dimensions into that bracket where we're in heavenly places. &gt;&gt; Okay. So we need to create that atmosphere and it's not up to the pastor, the minister who's preaching each and everyone. Amen. We create that atmosphere around us. Amen. Even if there's an unbeliever sitting next to us, there's such a presence of God. Amen. THAT EVEN MAKES THE THE VILEST SINNER CLEAN. &gt;&gt; WHY? Because the atmosphere we create. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So I I read the statement the other day and and and it it drove my attention. Amen. And it says that a cat that dreams of becoming a lion, are you with me? must lose its appetite for rats. &gt;&gt; So now chickens in the in the barnyard, they like to, you know, clock and and and then but we are the eagles. &gt;&gt; So it's ABOUT TIME WE STOP EATING, you know, the the little little No, no, WE HAVE AN OPEN BOOK THAT WAS GIVEN to us. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WE HAVE A A REAL STEAK, A GOOD STEAK. AMEN. THIS opening of the word is not SKIM MILK. AMEN. SOME PEOPLE DON'T DIGEST IT, BUT I LOVE IT. &gt;&gt; I LOVE THE REVEALED WORD. Satan hates Genesis and Revelation, BUT I LOVE IT. &gt;&gt; THE BRIDE, THE EAGLES, they love it. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, my title tonight, Amen, is the unstoppable seed of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you with me? The unstoppable seed of God, &gt;&gt; all is well. &gt;&gt; Brother David, you don't you don't know my my problems. &gt;&gt; All is well. &gt;&gt; Is it okay I preach tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. All is well. Oh, you know no, you don't know the GOD WE SERVE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. BROTHER HANNAH WAS GOING IN. HE THE ONE HE HOLDS THE UNIVERSE. THE ONE HE HOLDS. AMEN. EVERYTHING ABOUT US. HE KNOWS EVERY He knows my heartbeat. &gt;&gt; My red blood cells, my white blood cells, how many hairs? COME ON, CHURCH. &gt;&gt; WHAT A MIGHTY GOD WE SERVE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO THE UNSTOPPABLE SEED OF GOD, ALL is well. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the prophet says, "The seed, thy seed shall possess the gates of THE ENEMY." REMEMBER THAT'S THUS SAYETH THE LORD, &gt;&gt; Abraham's seed believes that. &gt;&gt; You never should be ashamed to say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; I know there's always a little barrier. Brother David has a little accent. Don't you worry. &gt;&gt; Don't you worry about that. &gt;&gt; I preach the word. Nothing that but the word of God. Amen. So, we're afraid to say amen because I might wake up my or I MIGHT SHAKE SOME. NO, NO. AMEN. THE MORE I WATER the word of God, THE MORE THE SEED OF GOD will grow and &gt;&gt; and will what will make me act according to the word. &gt;&gt; So, don't you be afraid of saying amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I love to say amen. I love to say hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know why? because God loves it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So he says Abraham's seed believes that. And if you are a genuine seed of Abraham, the faith that Abraham had in God is in you. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY GOD IN OUR generation came down to open the seals thereof. Amen. To give us what? 99% faith. How faith? No. Perfect faith. &gt;&gt; THE FAITH THAT ABRAHAM HAD IN GOD IS IN YOU. &gt;&gt; AND YOU BELIEVE THAT WHAT GOD HAS SAID, GOD keeps his promises. &gt;&gt; So what can you say against that? Satan. Boo. &gt;&gt; And I quote it many times your pastor on that. Boo devil. &gt;&gt; Boo. Amen. So tonight, Amen. The prophet says the Holy Spirit through the word is bringing you the good news. I'm bringing you good tidings of great joy. &gt;&gt; Amen. Great joy means WE CAN REJOICE TONIGHT. LET US BE GLAD AND REJOICE. AMEN. OH, have you ever seen a Christmas Oh, I'm against Christmas celebrations. Forget it. Christ was born. THE ANGELS CAME DOWN. I BRING YOU GOOD NEWS. MY SAVIOR, MY REDEEMER IS ON EARTH TO TAKE MY PLACE. &gt;&gt; I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE TREE. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE DECORATION. THE REAL CHRISTMAS IS CHRIST IN ME &gt;&gt; BORN. &gt;&gt; GLORY. GLORY. AMEN. AMEN. So the tonight the Holy Spirit THROUGH THE WORD IS BRINGING YOU THE GOOD NEWS THAT BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORD, GOD WROTE YOUR NAME. &gt;&gt; THERE ARE SOME HERE TONIGHT THAT DON'T EVEN CAN WRITE THEIR NAME. &gt;&gt; Do we have any babies? They're in the in the children room anyway. They cannot write their name. But God wrote their name. &gt;&gt; Come on now. AMEN. IN LAMB'S BOOK OF LIFE BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD AND ALL THE DEVILS OF HELL. &gt;&gt; COME ON NOW. CAN'T ERASE YOUR NAME. &gt;&gt; God wrote it and SPOKE IT AND IT'S JUST AS SURE TO HAPPEN as God WROTE IT IN THERE BEFORE the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; He chose you. &gt;&gt; He chose us. so that we can be strong in him. &gt;&gt; You never chose him and he brought YOU INTO CHRIST AND YOU ARE secure with Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; The only safety is in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can have the biggest assurance. &gt;&gt; Come on. Oh, I'm insured for $50 million. That's peanuts. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The only assurance IS IN JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; FROM THE YOUNGEST TO THE OLDEST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO, LET'S NOT WASTE OUR TIME TONIGHT. WE HAVE ONE MORE OPPORTUNITY. AMEN. TO COME TO CHRIST, TO GIVE OUR LIVES, TO SURRENDER. AMEN. AND AS A CHRISTIAN, YOU KNOW WHAT? WE ALWAYS WANT MORE OF GOD. &gt;&gt; He brought you into Christ and you are secure with Jesus Christ. And now listen, that's just to destroy Satan. Okay. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AND JUST AS PERFECT AS CHRIST WAS BEFORE GOD. &gt;&gt; SORRY, HONEY, but my wife, she doesn't see me perfect. She didn't say amen to that. Even though she thinks I'm the best. &gt;&gt; BUT GOD SEES US PERFECT. &gt;&gt; COME ON, STOP LOOKING THROUGH YOUR EYES. LET'S LOOK WITH THE WITH OUR EYES OF FAITH WHAT THE WORD WHAT GOD SAYS ABOUT ME, ABOUT US. GOD SEES JUST AS PERFECT AS CHRIST WAS BEFORE GOD. FOR YOU'RE NOT STANDING WITH YOUR OWN. YOU'RE STANDING IN HIM WITH ONE THING. &gt;&gt; WITH ONE THING. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT WITH A LIST. WITH ONE THING. I BELIEVE GOD. &gt;&gt; WOO. Is it that simple? YES. IF THOU CANST BELIEVE. AMEN. ONLY BELIEVE ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. PEOPLE, AMEN, that are afraid to take God at its word. I've tried, I'VE PRAYED, I'VE PRAYED, I'VE FASTED, I've prayed, I'VE BEEN IN PRAYER LINES. AMEN. WELL, TONIGHT YOU HAVE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY. &gt;&gt; TONIGHT, YOU HAVE ANOTHER MOMENT, A MEETING WITH GOD. &gt;&gt; THIS IS OUR TIME. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. The only thing is I believe God. Isn't that something? Amen. And that we can say that I believe God. Hallelujah. So now, amen. The prophet says, "And God's only provided a place of worship. He had in his heart before the foundation of the world a son because he is a father." So in him there were attributes. Amen. And it was still, listen how he says it, it was still in the genes of his word. Right? &gt;&gt; And he created a man and he had to put him on a free moral agency. But that man fell. But the great sculpture, &gt;&gt; God who made man from the dust of the earth, he didn't settle for that. &gt;&gt; So, oh, don't you tell me, Amen. God has abandoned me or God is no. As long as he's working on MY CLAY, I SAY, "THANK YOU, LORD JESUS." BECAUSE THAT MEANS HE DIDN'T THROW THE CLAY AWAY BECAUSE HE SEES THE VALUE IN YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. SATAN TELLS YOU YOU'RE USELESS. SATAN TELLS YOU YOU'RE WORTHLESS. BUT GOD SAYS YOU ARE WORTHY. THAT'S WHY I GAVE MY LIFE TO YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. God who made man from the dust of earth, he didn't settle for that. He started making man again. Yes. &gt;&gt; Now, you want to know, let me give you that definition of a gene. Now, don't think I'm I'm I'm very intelligent. I'm not. I'm a simple believer. &gt;&gt; Come on, saints. &gt;&gt; Don't Don't think because I'm from Switzerland, live in France, originally from Belgium, but really originally from God. Listen now. The definition of a gene is a heredity unit controlling a particular character. &gt;&gt; This genetic element corresponds to a segment of DNA or RNA located at a specific location, a locus on a chromosome. Now you young young I know it sounds like Chinese for me the same. I know each region of the DNA that produces a functional RNA molecule is a gene. Now the nucleus, those are all big words, but I'm I'm getting to a point here. The nucleus of the cell is the library which contains all the heredary heritage of the individual. And the chromosome is a book of this library. And the gene is one page of the book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now you want to talk about my gene. My spiritual gene that was in God before the foundation of the world. Amen. My name was written on this page. &gt;&gt; Amen. He wrote my name in the book. Amen. He wrote your name in the book. Amen. He sealed the book with seven seals. Amen. But he CAME DOWN IN MY generation to MAKE SURE IN MY AGE THAT I CAN SEE MY NAME IN THE BOOK THAT I CAN SEE. AMEN. I AM A GENE SEED FROM GOD. THAT'S WHY THE PROPHET SAYS THE GENE SEED FOUND YOU. &gt;&gt; I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. HE FOUND ME. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. TO GOD BE THE GLORY. AMEN. AMEN. AMEN. Isn't he worthy of our praise? Amen. So now could you imagine? Amen. God he loves. Amen. He talks about the great sculpture. Amen. And there's a story that goes, you all heard about Michelangelo. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He just has the gift that God gave him. &gt;&gt; Now he we know he's he he sculpted Moses. Amen. How it was an inspiration to the prophet. He also sculpted David. the statue of David. Amen. But there's a story behind there. Let me give you that story. Amen. There was a big piece of marble and that marble was originally cut for work before even Michelangelo was born. So in fact, it was commissioned to Agugustino Duchio in 1464. It's not a history class, huh? Just making a point here. 11 years before Michelangelo would come into this world. Eventually, Agiston could not decide what to do with it. So, he gave up the commission then, Amen. in 1476 when Michelangelo was just one year old. ANOTHER artist by the name of Antonio Rosolini, sorry, was commissioned to work with the marble. And as with Agugustino, he could not see what the marble could become. Come on now, saints. &gt;&gt; You know, I'm I'm going somewhere here. &gt;&gt; Even Leonardo da Vinci WAS ASKED TO CONSIDER working the marble and he declined for two reasons. First, he thought sculpting sculpting was a low form of art and he was arrogant in that way. Brilliant but arrogant. The old man rolled his eyes as if disgusted. Second, he took he he too could not see what the marble could become. So, three artists, famous artists, &gt;&gt; one of them of the most famous ever came before Michelangelo and could not see what the marble held deep inside. But Michelangelo, he saw the angel deep at rest within the rock, WAITING TO BE SET FREE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; SATAN TELLS US YOU'RE WORTHLESS. &gt;&gt; YOU WILL NEVER MAKE IT. &gt;&gt; WHAT IS THIS PIECE OF CLAY WALKING ON THIS EARTH IN THIS AGE OF LOUD? BUT MY GOD SAYS, "I SEE ONE OF MY SONS. UH, I SEE ONE OF MY DAUGHTERS. I PLACE A PART OF MYSELF IN THEM." &gt;&gt; AND HERE, MICHELANGELO. HE HAD A VISION. AMEN. STARTS GULPING. AND HERE COMES DAVID. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; GLORY. GLORY. THAT'S WHAT GOD DID WITH US. &gt;&gt; I'M NOT WORTHY, BUT HE SAID I WAS. SO WHY WILL WE LET SATAN KICK US AROUND? &gt;&gt; WHY DO WE LET SATAN TAKE OUR VICTORY, take our joy, take our peace, take our health? &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; THE SEED THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT IS AN UNSTOPPABLE SEED. &gt;&gt; AN UNSTOPPABLE. SATAN TRIED IT THROUGH THE AGES. SATAN TRIED IT EVEN WITH CHRIST. BUT OH LORD, he he conquered hell, DEATH, AND THE GRAVE. AND BECAUSE I LIVE, YE LIVE ALSO. &gt;&gt; Think of THE REJECTION OF THAT MARBLE. David laid there in that piece of marble since the beginning of time. WOO! &gt;&gt; MY BELOVED, tell me, why are you so excited? Well, because there was some dust on the earth. There was for one time. Amen. That God wanted me to live on this age. Amen. In this season, Amen. Because why? Because he chose me for such a time as this. &gt;&gt; Even in Laia when hell is Oh, yes. Because greater is he that is in me than he THAT IS IN THAT IS AGAINST ME. &gt;&gt; GLORY, GLORY, GLORY. AMEN. AMEN. So let's continue. You could continue on that. But Amen. He says, "Amen. You are here because your name was placed &gt;&gt; on the lamb's book of life before there even was a foundation of the world." Have you ever thought of that? We take things for granted. We walk on this earth, no matter how old, how young we are. But even before this earth was created, &gt;&gt; my name was written already in his book. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. He says, "You're a gene, a spiritual gene out of your heavenly father, a part of God's word. Now Jeremiah, you know the story about Jeremiah. Amen. Before I formed thee in thy belly, I knew thee. &gt;&gt; Before I breath, my first breath. &gt;&gt; And that's for each and every one of you. &gt;&gt; He knew me. &gt;&gt; Come on. Are you with me? It doesn't matter if I have 100,000, one million, or I don't care how many that know me. As long as he knows me &gt;&gt; and I know him. &gt;&gt; I don't care. Amen. How Satan has polluted everything. We need followers. No, WE NEED TO BE FOLLOWERS OF CHRIST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. So Jeremiah then said, "Ah, here he is. What do I do? I'm a little nobody. Like often we say, I don't know what to do. This trial is SO BIG. THIS THIS BATTLE IS I DON'T know how I how I. It's not me, it's he. &gt;&gt; Then said I, OH LORD GOD, BEHOLD, I CANNOT SPEAK, for I am a child. But the Lord said unto me, Say not, I am a child, for thou shalt go TO ALL THAT I SHALL SEND THEE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND WHATSOEVER I COMMAND THEE, THOU SHALT SPEAK, BE NOT AFRAID OF THEIR FACES, FOR I AM WITH THEE to deliver thee, sayeth the Lord. THEN THE LORD PUT FORTH HIS HAND and touch my mouth. And the Lord SAID UNTO ME, BEHOLD, I HAVE PUT MY WORDS IN THY mouth &gt;&gt; and things that are to be. Are you hearing my t the title of the prophet things that are to be &gt;&gt; now? &gt;&gt; The only way that you can be a son and a daughter of God because you have to have eternal life and there's only one form of eternal life and that's God's life. &gt;&gt; THERE'S ONLY ONE FORM OF ETERNAL LIFE AND THAT WAS GOD. There to be a son you had to be in him always. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Come on saints. THE GENE OF YOUR LIFE, SPIRITUAL LIFE TONIGHT WAS IN GOD THE FATHER BEFORE THERE EVEN WAS A MOLECULE. &gt;&gt; And you're nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life that was in God as a son of God. Now, now you're expressed after his word comes in you. You see the importance of the word coming in you, you becoming the word, the word becoming you. &gt;&gt; And I'm not talking about an intellectual knowledge. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about the dynamics on the mechanics. &gt;&gt; Amen. People can quote many quotes many many Bible verses, but it's only intellectual knowledge. The only way you CAN KNOW GOD IS BY AN EXPERIENCE WHERE GOD PERSONALLY REVEALS HIMSELF TO YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. THEREFORE, he Amen. You are expressing God's life in you because you are a son and a daughter of God. Wherever you are, &gt;&gt; wherever you are, God knew that you would be here. Brother, are you on the side on on the on the end of the He knew you were sitting there. &gt;&gt; I'm always sitting there. I don't even know. But God knows where why you're sitting there, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Because you have to be one of his genes or his attributes. You have to be. If you ever got eternal life, then it always was eternal life. And God before there was a foundation of the world, he knew that you would be here. Now God doesn't make mistakes. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And when the word or the water, the washing of the water of the words fell upon you, it was expressing a being. &gt;&gt; Just like Michelangelo started hitting that marble. Amen. He saw something inside. And that's why this true FIVE-FOLD MINISTRY SAYS NOTHING ELSE BUT WHAT THE WORD HAS SAID ALREADY. NOT ADDING TO YOU, NOT TAKING AWAY. WHY? AMEN. THE WASHING OF THE WATER OF THE WORD. &gt;&gt; OH, I don't need it, brother David. YES, YOU DO. EVEN MORE THAN YOU THINK. AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO WHEN GOD ANNOUNCED THE MINISTRY TO SPEAK &gt;&gt; PERSONALLY TO YOU, &gt;&gt; DON'T GET MAD. &gt;&gt; BE HUMBLE AND SAY, "LORD, LET IT BE ACCORDING TO THY WORD." &gt;&gt; We know that one Corinthians 11 says, "The woman is the glory of the man." Amen. Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thine the glory then. Love you too, brother. The Bible talks about how we are the jewels in his crown. &gt;&gt; I don't see myself as a jewel. You don't see yourself as a jewel. &gt;&gt; Now let let me just you know a diamond is just a piece of coal. &gt;&gt; It's only the experts that can distinguish what is what. &gt;&gt; Only the great sculpture. He knows all about us &gt;&gt; and he knows what he laid inside of us. &gt;&gt; So a diamond is just a piece of coal. You know what that did well under pressure. &gt;&gt; Come on saints. &gt;&gt; Even though we are living in Laudisa, there's a lot of pressure but it's for our good. It's for our good saints. Amen. Because a diamond Amen. becomes a true diamond when he's under pressure. Amen. Amen. So let Amen. There's many things against us. &gt;&gt; BUT GREATER IS HE THAT is in you. Amen. And he that is against you. &gt;&gt; SO LET GOD HAVE HIS WAY IN MY LIFE, IN YOUR LIFE, AND YOUR THIS SEED is unstoppable. &gt;&gt; That's right. Come on, saints. &gt;&gt; You know, rough diamonds vary greatly in appearance. You have big ones, small ones. We're all different. &gt;&gt; But what a nice bouquet we have here tonight. &gt;&gt; What a beautiful jewels we have. Oh, I didn't think I was going to hear that. It's not only for the sisters that like the big diamonds. You know, BROTHERS, YOU ARE DIAMONDS, TOO. &gt;&gt; AMEN. They can be perfectly listen symmetrical, twisted, deformed like that marble. Nobody sees what what does anybody see in me? Thank God my wife saw something in me. &gt;&gt; But she's not the only one. God saw something before my wife saw something in me. &gt;&gt; Just like you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Twisted, deformed, luminous, clear, foggy. Amen. It doesn't matter. Amen. They have a potential of beauty. Amen. that any experienced tailor or store stone cutter will recognize. You know why? &gt;&gt; Listen now. Because no matter what they look on the outside, &gt;&gt; no matter what we look ON THE OUTSIDE, ALL DIAMONDS ARE MADE OF THE SAME PERFECT CHEMICAL ANATOMIC COMPOSITION INSIDE. SO NO MATTER HOW WE LOOK, I'M NOT WHAT I HAVE TO BE, BUT I AIN'T WHAT I USED TO BE. I'M ON MY WAY. WE ARE ON OUR WAY. GOD AIN'T FINISHED WITH ME. HE AIN'T FINISHED WITH YOU. BUT GOD IS BRINGING US TO PERFECTION. &gt;&gt; AMEN. And Satan comes playing with our minds, telling you, you're nobody. You cannot make it. BUT THE LORD TELLS US, YOU'RE MY DIAMOND. I'M NOT DONE WITH YOU YET. SO JUST CONTINUE what we just quoted it. The only thing we say is I believe God. &gt;&gt; Not I believe what Satan says. Not what the report of the doctor says. Not not what ANYBODY SAYS. WHAT GOD SAYS ABOUT ME. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. AMEN. We know that the big diamond the prophet talks about it. Amen. He was wounded for our transgressions. &gt;&gt; Right. Hallelujah. He was bruised for our iniquity. The chastisement of our peace, amen, was upon him. AND BY HIS STRIPES, WE ARE ALREADY HEALED. WHAT WAS HE DOING? REFLECTING. &gt;&gt; He is the Messiah, the big diamond. &gt;&gt; And we are the messettes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Any man that claims to be a certain God and that denies divine healing and his power is not getting his light from that diamond. Not getting his light from that throne. &gt;&gt; SHINE ON ME, LORD. &gt;&gt; SHINE ON ME. &gt;&gt; I WANT TO COME TO MATURITY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. NOT a junior baby believer. &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on. &gt;&gt; The time has come with the opening of the word &gt;&gt; that we have come to maturity. That's why the word of God tells us we have to lay in the presence of the Sen. That's what is going on when we hear the word. We hear of Ryphen AND WE HEAR FROM GOD TELLING US WHO WE ARE. &gt;&gt; SHINE ON ME LORD. &gt;&gt; LORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. because it's reflecting him the same yesterday, today, and forever in Oh, hallelujah. Through those seven church ages. Amen. What God did in Christ, Christ does in you. What s What signs God did in Christ, Christ does in you. &gt;&gt; Isn't that something? God didn't just choose uses to walk on this earth and to say, "I'm I'm a message believer." &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Is that okay, &gt;&gt; young boys? &gt;&gt; He chose us for a specific purpose. &gt;&gt; To destroy Satan's kingdom. When Satan has pulled everything he had, &gt;&gt; everything hell on the earth, God says, "I will raise a standard." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There will be a bride without spot, without wrinkle. &gt;&gt; He chose me for that. He chose you for that. Yes, he did. Let me continue for a little while. Amen. So, could you imagine God gave us what? the most powerful weapon we could have. &gt;&gt; Now, the problem is, and I know I'm in the United States, so don't pull guns on me now. &gt;&gt; Sister Nancy, love you. Don't get your gun out. God gave us the most powerful weapon there is in the earth. And here we think because I have a machine gun, I have a rifle, I have a bazooka, I have a tank, I have this, that I'm powerful. No, God gave you already the most powerful weapon. Whether you're a little young boy here or an elderly sister, no matter, he gave us the most powerful weapon, &gt;&gt; that is his word. Now, the prophet tells us, Amen. If you are in the United States, Amen. He says, "Amen." When they are the United States Army training a man to sit around and eat cookies and so forth, think of it. &gt;&gt; Your taxes pay millions for those guys to eat cookies. &gt;&gt; I'm bringing it home now. Huh? &gt;&gt; I know money is always a sensitive thing. Sorry, I don't want to get in. He gives a uniform. He gives a gun and trains the soldiers to get out there and fight and defend the nation. &gt;&gt; And that's what we've got to do. We've got to defend OUR GODGIVEN RIGHTS. WHAT GOD SAID, IT'S OURS. THE PROBLEM IS IF you don't know what is yours, &gt;&gt; how can you defend what is yours? &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Ask and you shall receive. &gt;&gt; No matter what it is, &gt;&gt; my Lord and Savior, he is the answer to it all. &gt;&gt; Let me continue for a little while here. Amen. He says they are ours. We believe him and you just might as well move back because you have nothing at all. Telling Satan you have nothing at all. Satan has got one legal rights of anything. Everything he's got. &gt;&gt; Come on. Why don't YOU SAY IT WITH ME? EVERYTHING HE'S GOT IS DEFEATED. THE ONLY THING HE IS IS A SCARECROW. THAT'S ALL. HE CANNOT BOTHER YOU. &gt;&gt; OH, brother David, that sounds so good, but I still have battles. What do you think you're here for? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; For a picnic. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; To eat cookies. &gt;&gt; The problem is YOU LOOK THROUGH YOUR EYES AND YOU THINK YOU HAVE TO USE YOUR MUSCLES. YOU USED TO HAVE your gun, YOUR MACHINE GUN. NO. USE THE WEAPON THAT GOD GAVE YOU. THE WORD OF GOD. IT IS WRITTEN. I BELIEVE IT. I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT. I DON'T SEE IT, BUT I BELIEVE IT. &gt;&gt; Think of it. Now, this is not just Brother Brandham saying something to say something nice. Are you hearing me, brother David? I heard it. Well, it's about time it becomes a reality. &gt;&gt; EVERYTHING HE'S GOT IS DEFEATED. THE ONLY THING HE IS IS A SCARECROW. Do you think why brother Ron Amen he dares to say service after service or your boo devil &gt;&gt; from the youngest to the oldest you can say by faith not like a big mountain but a mustard SEED FAITH BOO GET THEE BEHIND ME I AM A SON OF GOD I AM A DAUGHTER OF GOD. &gt;&gt; He cannot bother you now. He, brother David, he bothers me. He comes. Resist the devil and he will flee from you. &gt;&gt; Brother David, I have this illness for stand for what God has given you. &gt;&gt; A man that's born of the spirit of God, THERE'S NOTHING AT ALL THAT can harm him. That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Come on, soldiers of the cross. &gt;&gt; Amen. I say this belongs to me AND THAT'S MY LEGAL POSSESSION. BY HIS STRIPES, I AM ALREADY HEALED. &gt;&gt; You know what the problem is? We doubt the weapon &gt;&gt; and we lose confidence &gt;&gt; in the great sculpture &gt;&gt; and a creator &gt;&gt; because we prayed and it can last on for months and months and I've had enough. &gt;&gt; Do you imagine one of the American soldiers standing on the battlefront? He's there and then all of a sudden, well, this this thing here that I have, uh, I don't trust it anymore because I've been you, it's been months and and and and that's what we do with the word of God. &gt;&gt; We start doubting what God has promised already &gt;&gt; because Satan comes around. He plays with our head. He plays with our mind. But God plays something inside of each and every one of you there. Amen. That is a seed gene of God. Amen. That is way stronger than what Satan can put in your mind. &gt;&gt; If you can JUST SAY, "I BELIEVE GOD." &gt;&gt; WHY DID BROTHER BRANDHAM SAY WHEN THEY CAME IN THE PRAYER LINES, "Go thank God for your healing." &gt;&gt; Why does brother Ron, and yes, he's your pastor, you know VERY WELL. BUT WHY IS HE SUCH A TESTIMONY not only to the believers, to doctors, &gt;&gt; to cancer patients, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? BECAUSE HE'S NOT ACTING ON HIS FEELINGS. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; HE'S NOT ACTING on how he feels OR WHAT THE CHURCH SAY OR WHAT THE DOCTORS SAY. HE'S STANDING ON THE PROMISES OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S NOT ONLY FOR BROTHER RON. WHAT ABOUT US? WHAT ABOUT YOU? &gt;&gt; EVERY REDEMPTIVE BLESSING OF GOD BELONGS to you. IT'S YOUR PERSONAL PROPERTY. &gt;&gt; Personal property. You got a right to claim it. Now, believe me, if I tell you the White House is yours, you will go claim it. Do I make a point? Now, there's this big ballroom or whatever you call it. I got an amen there. you would go claim it. And God tells us that every promise in the book is yours. &gt;&gt; Every chapter, every verse, every line. &gt;&gt; Why don't we claim our God-given privileges? &gt;&gt; He died to pay the total, full, complete, and I don't know how many other words you can put, price. All right. &gt;&gt; For us, &gt;&gt; so it's not in our strength. It's in the Lord &gt;&gt; that is our strength. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "But that's up to you now to go claim it and say, "It is written." When you ask for anything, go get it. &gt;&gt; MY KIDS, WHEN THEY ASK SOMETHING, WE WANT ICE CREAM, you have to go get it. &gt;&gt; Or you tell them, "Go get it. Am I the only one here? You know, we do so many things naturally and spiritually we miss the simplicity, the depth of the word of God. That's why many people they're confused because after the opening of the seventh seal there was silence and there no something real is going on. See if we go there tomorrow. But something real is going on. &gt;&gt; He's revealing his secrets. What secrets? Who you are &gt;&gt; that you are an invincible army, an unstoppable seed of God. &gt;&gt; Think of it. if you could only realize who you are &gt;&gt; and what God wants to do with you. &gt;&gt; So when you ask for anything, go get it and don't take nothing less. Get what you asked because we are heir to all things. Heir to all things. The bride of Christ owns every speck of it. You know what every speck of it is? that every even a point a comma question mark anything every speck is yours. &gt;&gt; What what what good is a is a dot. Hey you eat the full book. &gt;&gt; You eat the whole book. &gt;&gt; So you become the book. Let's continue. Where is the God? He says that led Jesus Christ from victory unto victory. Amen. When you got God on your side, who can be against you? &gt;&gt; Amen. WHEN YOU GOT GOD ON YOUR SIDE, WHO can be against you? Amen. So, Satan, he will try to hinder EVERY MEETING AS HARD AS HE CAN. &gt;&gt; Satan will come around with mind battles. Not only mind battles, he will come around with a very tiring spirit. &gt;&gt; This brother David, he's wearing me out. &gt;&gt; And if it's for a bowl game, &gt;&gt; okay, now I'm going to the sisters. Sorry. Maybe they also followed ball games here. Oh, yeah. Okay. Okay. When they prepare a nice Christmas cake, birthday cake, they're into it. &gt;&gt; Could you imagine Sister Katie making a nice cake for Brother Andrew? And and in the middle of the kitchen, oh, Brother Andrew comes home. Hey, honey. How are you? And she's laying in a cake. It's good. Good. I got your attention. That's what Satan, that's the prophet that says the devil comes arise comes around trying to hinder every meeting as hard as he can. &gt;&gt; He's trying to keep to to to take your focus of the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why personally, you know where my favorite place is in the church when I visit a church when I'm not preaching. Amen. And even is IN THE FRONT. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHY? WAY IN THE BACK. YOU SEE SO MANY THINGS. &gt;&gt; Go ahead. &gt;&gt; This one is falling asleep. Oh, and and you miss &gt;&gt; ONE WORD, SAINTS. ONE WORD CAN CHANGE YOUR LIFE. OH, not me, brother David. Oh, yes. Exactly. Each and every one of us. &gt;&gt; Because Satan is very subtle. He is very subtle. Amen. So, he will do that to every God sent meeting. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's what we having. &gt;&gt; Amen. The devil will work everything he can to keep it from coming, BUT YOU GO ANYHOW. WHEN YOU HEAR THE WORD, AMEN. SATAN CAN TELL YOU, "OH, MY LEG is still hurting, or I still feel MY STOMACH, OR I STILL HAVE A HEADACHE." YOU GO GET IT. IT'S YOUR GOD-GIVEN PRIVILEGES. &gt;&gt; GOD SAID SO. YOU STAND TOE-TO-TOE WITH HIM AND SAY, "IT'S THUS, SAYETH THE LORD, YOU RESIST THE DEVIL AND HE WILL FLEE FROM YOU." AMEN. &gt;&gt; And we who are in contact with the spiritual realm of God. Well, I was prayed for and I didn't get healed. So, I guess there's nothing to it. What a poor crow crowbait you make for God. God wants somebody. &gt;&gt; Do we have somebody's here? Amen. Come on. &gt;&gt; God wants somebody who will not give up. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Come on, SAINTS. &gt;&gt; WHO DON'T GIVE UP? AMEN. NO MATTER WHAT COMES. AMEN. WE hear news WE DIDN'T EXPECT. BUT ALL IS WELL. &gt;&gt; ALL IS WELL. &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE GOD SAID SO. &gt;&gt; I'M NOT DEPENDING ON MY STRENGTH. I'M NOT COUNTING ON MY FORCE, ON MY POWER. I'M COUNTING ON THE LORD. &gt;&gt; SOMEBODY WHO WILL NOT GIVE UP. A WINNER NEVER QUITS AND A QUITTER NEVER WINS. &gt;&gt; You tell him that's the way to do to go get it. You say, "THUS SAYETH THE LORD, GOD DONE YOUR HEALING. I SHALL RECEIVE IT. IT'S MINE. IT'S MY PERSONAL PROPERTY. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There you are. There is the body of Christ living, standing, redeemed. Why? Listen now. We are not we will be not we were &gt;&gt; we are what are we? his victory. Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; That means victory is you triumph over everything. You know in the millennium we will not need divine healing. &gt;&gt; We will not need deliverances. In the millennium we won't need we won't need every god-given promise. It is for us IN OUR SEASON, IN OUR TIME. BECAUSE WITH the opening of the book, with the revealed word comes THE RESTORATION OF THE POWER. &gt;&gt; GREATER is he that is IN YOU THAN HE THAT IS AGAINST YOU. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, I'm the least in the church. Did anybody think that? I don't not ask you to raise hands. I'm just going to say, "Yeah, &gt;&gt; because that's what Satan tells. You're the least in the church. I'm just a little bitty fellow. What does God want?" I mean, &gt;&gt; that little soldier. I'm not diminishing you, huh, boys? You're great heroes of the faith. &gt;&gt; Cuz when you have childlike faith, Satan is finished. So the prophet says here just a little bitty fellow he says remember when he ascended on high see you are raised with him you're in the body and you're with Christ right now seated in heavenly places if you're the skin of the bottom of the feet &gt;&gt; I can still do that at my age you I'm still young. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Don't look at the hair. Amen. If you're THE SKIN ON THE BOTTOM OF YOUR FEET, &gt;&gt; there's only one devil under your feet. &gt;&gt; No. No. No. No. No. No. No. That's not what he says. That's not what God says us. He says every &gt;&gt; devil is underneath you. &gt;&gt; So you know you have needs. Brother David doesn't know anything about your needs. But God has a plan for you because there's an unstoppable seed in you &gt;&gt; that Satan through the ages tried to stop. And now we come at the pinnacle. We come at the age where God said, "I will have a bride &gt;&gt; and she will be bone of my bone, flesh of my flesh, spirit of my spirit. &gt;&gt; She is him." &gt;&gt; How does that make you feel? &gt;&gt; God is still almighty. Even tonight, even when things look impossible, I'm going to get through a few examples. When did I start preaching? I don't know. So, every devil is underneath you. Where the head is, the body is. And we are seated in heavenly places in Christ Jesus with every fire of hell under us. So, it's not we have to go through Laudia. We have victory in Laudia. &gt;&gt; That's right. Come on. Come on. &gt;&gt; Every sickness. Amen. Every sin, everything, even death itself. That's right. We are more than conquerors in him. &gt;&gt; Let me go for a few moments to the scripture because Satan, he wants us to learn to live with these demons. &gt;&gt; Amen. I call them demons because sickness is a demon. &gt;&gt; Any anything that is contrary to the word is a demon. &gt;&gt; Comes from Satan. And Daniel 11:32 says, "And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall be corrupt by flatteries, but the people that know their God, &gt;&gt; they shall be strong and do exploits." &gt;&gt; So we see a few words there. And if you look in the Greek lexican, amen, wickedly is mean to be guilty, to be condemned. The people that know their God, the people is a flock, is a troops, the troops of the living God. The kindred says the Greek lexican only the ones he chose. That know means to know by experience, to be acquainted with, to be revealed. Amen. They shall be strong. That means to prevail upon, to grow firm, to be secure, to withstand. &gt;&gt; And exploit means a heroic act to make productive use of it. &gt;&gt; PRODUCTIVE USE OF YOUR WEAPON. &gt;&gt; Not lay IT THERE ON THE SHELF. &gt;&gt; OH, BROTHER RON, CAN YOU PLEASE PRAY FOR ME? AND NO, YOU HAVE A WEAPON. &gt;&gt; USE YOUR WEAPON. CLAIM YOUR GOD-GIVEN RIGHT. DEFEND WHAT IS YOURS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. So a person either knows God or doesn't know God. 1 John 5:20 says, "And we know that the son of God has come and had given us an understanding that we may know him that is true and we are in him. That is true even in his son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life." So those that don't turn away, those that know their God from the truth of the word of God, they will be strong and do exploits. What does John 14:12 says? Are you following? Can you pull that up so everybody can see it? Why don't you read it with me? Amen. &gt;&gt; Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also, AND GREATER WORKS than these shall he do, because I go unto the father. &gt;&gt; THAT'S CONCERNING US. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE EXPLOITS God wants us to do. &gt;&gt; Me? Yes, you. &gt;&gt; Abraham. Let's take an example. Abraham. I'm coming to a point trying to wind out. But Abraham, he was 75 years old. Sarah was 65. Amen. He was married with her. Amen. Then he continued and he says, "Well, she was past menopause and it was impossible for her to have a baby. &gt;&gt; Those are the facts. &gt;&gt; You have many facts in your life. &gt;&gt; My stomach is this. My heart is this. My brain is this. My kidneys are this. My job is this. My house is this. My family is this. &gt;&gt; JUST FACTS. &gt;&gt; FACTS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. GOD ASKED ABRAHAM TO believe the impossible. &gt;&gt; I love it, brother. As long as it was for Abraham. &gt;&gt; Come on. That was good. You know, it was good because you know Abraham, he was a hero of the faith after all. You know, he's &gt;&gt; okay. How many believe God sent us his word in our age? &gt;&gt; Okay. So, let's listen what God says. God asked Abraham to believe the impossible. AND HE ASKED YOU, the seed of Abraham, to believe THE IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE HIS WORD is a creative thing. &gt;&gt; ABRAHAM JUST HELD ON TO GOD'S WORD. HE BELIEVED GOD. THAT'S ALL HE HAD TO DO. HE DIDN'T LOOK HOW IMPOSSIBLE IT WAS. HE JUST ACCEPTED IT &gt;&gt; AND TOOK GOD AT HIS WORD AND WENT TO rejoicing over it. &gt;&gt; God loved that. We can go rejoicing. &gt;&gt; Let us rejoice and be glad. &gt;&gt; For a bride has made herself ready. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you can rejoice over your trial. Oh yeah, but my leg is is is is avoiding me to, you know, to to feel the liberty in the house of God. Don't worry. Start just, you know, brother Brandon says if you have pain, JUST EVEN START moving your little finger and little by little and little and a little WHEN THE ANOINTING COMES DOWN. AMEN. AND YOU WON'T FEEL YOUR PAIN ANYMORE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE GOD WE SERVE. ABRAHAM BELIEVED AGAINST ALL ODDS. HE GREW STRONGER IN THE FAITH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. We shouldn't come in this building. I'm making it very personal now, but in the time that we're living, saints, there's not much TIME LEFT. AND GOD GAVE US EVERYTHING, EVERYTHING WE HAVE NEED OF IN OUR LIFE JOURNEY. &gt;&gt; We should COME IN THIS HOUSE REJOICING. &gt;&gt; Giving God glory. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, LORD JESUS. I HAD A BIG TRIAL TODAY. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, JESUS. LET ME GIVE A TESTIMONY. &gt;&gt; Brother David, you're completely Woohoo. &gt;&gt; No, I know the God that I serve. &gt;&gt; If God can create eyes, can make legs grow, Amen. can put hips back in place, can heal cancers, CAN MAKE THE DEAD RISE, HE'S STILL THE SAME GOD WE SERVE TONIGHT. WE'RE NOT WALKING WHAT WE SEE. WE WALK BY FAITH. &gt;&gt; AND IF ABRAHAM AMEN. THAT'S WHY HE MAKES IT PERSONAL. HE ASKED YOU, THE SEED OF ABRAHAM, TO BELIEVE the impossible. &gt;&gt; He held unto God's word. Abraham, he didn't become weaker and weaker. Let the weak say I am strong. &gt;&gt; Let the blind say I can see. &gt;&gt; Hosana hosana to the king of kings. That's why saints, let's not miss every opportunity God gives us &gt;&gt; to give glory to God. &gt;&gt; Cuz he says, "Let go and rejoice." Can you imagine Abraham, "Honey, you're going to have a baby." The first day, those that are married, there he goes. Oh, yeah. And every day he thanked God, rejoiced about &gt;&gt; honey, we can have the promised son. &gt;&gt; What about us? &gt;&gt; What about us? When the greatest treasure has been given to us, &gt;&gt; a revealed Christ revealed to us an open book. Why? We are the people of the promised land of the book, the open book. &gt;&gt; I'm getting to a point. Give me a few more minutes. &gt;&gt; God, he wants that kind of witnesses that are courageous. He wants us to be courageous. He has told every believer the same thing just like he did to Joshua and Caleb. I'll be with you even to the end of the world. I'll never leave you nor forsake thee. Courageous. Let's go take the promise. God gave us a promise. Let's be a real witness. &gt;&gt; Amen. I can even give a testimony before it happens. &gt;&gt; I can't remember if I gave that testimony here, but let me give a testimony. Brother Daryl Ward, he he he experienced, maybe you heard it, probably you heard a sister who didn't have a hip. Probably you heard it, but she didn't have a hip. And she came in prayer line, was prayed for. She came back every service. I want to give a testimony. God, heal me from my hip. Think of it. I don't know how she was walking, but without a hip, you know. Every service after service, I have a testimony. And it continued, her faith grew stronger. &gt;&gt; She rejoiced over the promise that God gave. &gt;&gt; Until people in the church started, here she goes again. He continued until even the pastor listen okay one more time I'll let you give a testimony think of it saints and it's exactly at that time at that moment &gt;&gt; the same testimony that was giving service after service &gt;&gt; I want to give glory to God Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; For giving me a hip AND POP &gt;&gt; HIP POPS. AMEN. THOSE THAT ARE IN THE MEDICAL FIELD. AMEN. OH, THEY CAN MAYBE PUT IN A FAKE HIP, YOU KNOW, A PROTEISE OR SOMETHING. BUT WE SERVE THE CREATOR OF HEAVEN AND EARTH. HE CREATED THAT HIP. BELIEVE ME, SAINTS. SHE WALKED ON THE PLATFORM MAYBE LIKE THIS, BUT SHE JUMPED OFF THE PLATFORM GIVING GLORY TO GOD. SHAME ON US. SHAME ON US. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; IF WE DOUBT GOD'S PROMISES, &gt;&gt; SHAME ON US. IN ALL THINGS, HE'S WORTHY OF OUR PRAISE. &gt;&gt; IN ALL THINGS, IN THE GOOD DAYS, IN THE BAD DAYS. &gt;&gt; Is he the God only for the sister? He's the God for you tonight. &gt;&gt; HE'S THE SAME GOD YESTERDAY, TODAY, and forever. Amen. Amen. You know, let me You may be seated if just I'm winding up. I want to come to an example that I love. And that's what God gave me, brother Ron. He spoke when we arrived Thursday night. And he woke me up with that. All is well. Are you hearing me saints? These are not my words. &gt;&gt; Don't look through your eyes. Don't look through what you can reason, what you can understand. Just say, "Lord, I believe. &gt;&gt; I believe God. I believe his word." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There's a story in the Bible you all know, the woman. I just want to focus on that situation for a while. We took Abraham But listen in two kings 4 and I'm I'm coming to a certain point where he said Elisha what then is to be done for her? Elisha asking her oh what can be done for her? Gahazi answered verily she had no child and her husband is old. Those are facts. no child and is old. Just like we hear many facts, even little boys here and as we grow older, there are more and more facts. They're only facts. Heaven and earth will pass away, &gt;&gt; but the word of God will last forever. &gt;&gt; So here we he said call her. And when he had called her, she stood in the door and he said, "About this season, according to the time of life, thou shalt embrace a son." And she said, "Nay, my lord, thou man of God, DO NOT LIE UNTO thy handmmaid." So look at her attitude. HE SAID, "PLEASE DON'T DON'T TELL ME SOMETHING. DON'T LIE TO ME. &gt;&gt; God never lies to us." &gt;&gt; Satan always lies to us. When Satan tells you something, it's a lie. &gt;&gt; So if he says you're not going to make it, you start rejoicing. Say, "Thank God, I'm going to make it." &gt;&gt; If you have an addiction, START SAYING, "THANK YOU, GOD, FOR MY DELIVERANCE." &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WE SERVE A GOD THAT STILL DELIVERS TODAY, &gt;&gt; THAT BREAKS EVERY CHAIN OF DOUBT, EVERY CHAIN OF SIN. So she's saying, "Please don't lie to me." And the woman conceived and bear a son that the season at the season that Elisha had said unto her, "According to the time of life." And when the child was grown, it fell on the day that he went out of his father the reapers. And he said unto his father, "My head, my head." Now listen. And he said to a lad, "Cray carry him to his mother. And when he had taken him and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon and then died. She went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God and shut the door upon him and she went out." Then she called unto her husband and said, "Send me, I pray thee, one of the young men and one of these ass, and I may run to the man of God and come again." And he said, "Wherefore will thou go to him today? It is neither new moon nor Sabbath." You know, Satan also sometimes he says, "Why why would you ask now? Why would you rejoice now? Why would you? &gt;&gt; We we think, you know, I didn't get a hold of the pastor and and then so what? Get a hold of Jesus." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Get a hold of him. &gt;&gt; Amen. That makes the whole difference &gt;&gt; because even though your pastor can pray for you, it's according to your faith. &gt;&gt; I don't love brother Ron because he prayed for me and it didn't happen. Well, you said you were a believer. &gt;&gt; Start rejoicing. &gt;&gt; By faith, rejoice and you will grow stronger in the faith. Every day you will worship and even if you fall, you will raise up again. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So he continues, "Amen. Then saddle uh sorry it came to pass when the man of God saw a far off." We read that run now, I pray thee, to meet her and say unto her, sorry, let me go up verse 23. It is neither the new moon nor Sabbath. And she said, listen to what she said, what she testifies. It shall be well. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The facts is he's dead. The facts say you have cancer. The facts say you have problems with YOUR HEART. THE FACTS says you have problems WITH YOUR JOB. THE FACTS say you Satan tells you you're NEVER GOING TO MAKE IT. &gt;&gt; The fact is, well, your blood cells, red ones or blue or white ones are too low, too high. Your kidneys don't work. Your your your lungs ARE COMPLETELY OUT AND WHATEVER YOU NAME IT. and she testifies, "It shall be well." &gt;&gt; Then she saddled an ass and said to her servant, "Drive and go forward, slack, not thy riding for me, except I bid thee." So she went and came unto the man of God to Mount Carmel. And it came to pass when the man of God saw her far off. And he said to Ghazi, his servant, "Behold, yonder is the tsunami. Run now, I pray to meet her, and say unto her, Is it well with thee? Now the prophet tells us he doesn't reveal everything to his prophets. &gt;&gt; Elisha didn't know anything about &gt;&gt; is is everything okay? &gt;&gt; I should have started like this the service is is all well. &gt;&gt; Come on saints. &gt;&gt; You heard the word tonight is all well. &gt;&gt; Sorry. Elisha says, "Amen. Is all well? Amen. Uh, is it well with thy husband? Is it well with thy child?" So he even brings it to her husband and the child. And she answered, "It is well." &gt;&gt; When you look that up in the lexicon, the Greek lexican, you know what the word well means? Shalom. Shalom means peace. Peace on earth. Are you getting in a Christmas spirit? Oh, I had it since Christ came in me. &gt;&gt; It is well. &gt;&gt; That is a peace that God can give us beyond any understanding. No matter the doctor may tell you this and it looks like that and this and that and that. all as well. &gt;&gt; And no mental intellectual can say a thing like that. &gt;&gt; But the seed, the unstoppable seed of God says it by faith. Says it is well. &gt;&gt; All is well. And God restored. God restored. The prophet I'm I'm I'm winding up now. Don't worry. I'm not brother Tim. I love him. He's my buddy. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I know. I know. He's precious. He's very precious, brother. It's him. Real man of God. &gt;&gt; And he says, prophet says, I love that story. And here this woman, she laid her child on the prophet's bed and her great faith in God. And when Elisha asked her the question, she said, "Is all well with thee? And is all well thy husband? It is all thy son." Now listen at the woman, the prophet says. She says, "All is well." What faith &gt;&gt; I would to God that we could have faith like that. &gt;&gt; I said, "Lord, &gt;&gt; faith cometh by hearing, hearing of the word of God. Not what the doctor says, not what your boss says, NOT WHAT THE GOVERNMENT SAYS, NOT WHAT SATAN SAYS, BUT WHAT GOD SAYS IS THE ONLY TRUTH. And if tonight we could hold onto God's representative like that, listen now. If you could tell the Holy Spirit tonight, as sure as you are, the immortal spirit of God, you gave me a promise in the Bible of my healing, and I'm going to hold on till I see something happen. There would be miracles taking place. &gt;&gt; You know God, we serve a miracle working God. &gt;&gt; The only limit to God is the limit of our faith. &gt;&gt; Brother David, you're way too personal. I'm not. It has to be personal. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because God is coming for individuals. &gt;&gt; He's not coming for a group. He's coming for individuals. Amen. There would be miracles taking place. He says the lame would be jumping and running. &gt;&gt; GOD BLESS BROTHER MATT. &gt;&gt; WE BELIEVE HE CAN RESTORE HIS BACKBONE, &gt;&gt; HIS MUSCLES. CAN THESE DRY BONES LIVE? YES, THEY CAN. THOU MUST PROPHESY AGAIN. YOU SPEAK THE WORD, YOU BELIEVE THE WORD AND GO REJOICING. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. The lame would be jumping and running and the doctors of Virginia, he says Los Angeles, would be surprised tomorrow to see their patients healed and well. &gt;&gt; Glory, glory, glory. THIS IS A TIME OF REJOICING. IT'S NOT BECAUSE IT'S CHRISTMAS. PEOPLE THINK, "OH, WE NEED AN OCCASION." NO. EVERY TIME WE COME INTO HIS PRESENCE, WE COME WITH REJOICING. AMEN. WITH THANKSGIVING, GIVING GLORY, THANKING HIM. &gt;&gt; For the answer to your need. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; AND HE'S HERE. HE'S HERE FOR YOU. AMEN. AMEN. AMEN. If I can only get a hold of God's agent, God's agent then was Elisha. And God's agents today is THE HOLY SPIRIT. HOLD ON TO IT. WHEN YOU ever come in contact and you feel the Holy SPIRIT ON YOU, HOLD ON TO IT. &gt;&gt; It will not leave you. &gt;&gt; That's right. Stay with it like Jacob did when he wrestled with the angel. I'm call going to hold on until you bless me and give me the things that I'm desiring. A wonderful revival would break out. I'm saying, Lord, revive me. You know, many people say there's no revival. Well, there is a true revival. &gt;&gt; And it's not limited in the time. It goes on. The bride's revival is a reality. &gt;&gt; It's not one day up and the next one down. It's a continuous &gt;&gt; from glory to glory. Oh yes, it's a battle and we have to fight for every inch. &gt;&gt; You know, possession footprints, sorry, means possession. &gt;&gt; You know the story. I'm I'm finishing on that to make it real even for whoever we think footprints means possession. Let me give you an example. Neil Armstrong. Have we who heard of Neil Armstrong here? &gt;&gt; Good. Even the young. In July 20th, 1969, he was the first man to put the footprint on the moon. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, they put a flag and there's many discussions. It's not about the flag. The Americans wanted to be the first one and they put an imprint and they said, "It's mine. The Russians could go, the Indians could go, the Chinese could go. The Europeans could go. &gt;&gt; It's mine." &gt;&gt; And God tells us, "Go into your land now, &gt;&gt; into your promises." And every footprint &gt;&gt; is your possession. &gt;&gt; You don't need to make giant steps, &gt;&gt; but just keep on moving forward. &gt;&gt; Just like the testimony I gave about that sister, just keep moving forward &gt;&gt; and it's yours. Don't go backwards. &gt;&gt; You keep on going forward &gt;&gt; because it's yours. Prophet says what the church needs is tonight is some more footprints over here in the land saying Lord help us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God said it's yours. He takes an example in the blind man Barttous. He says sister you in that wheelchair. Now facts are a sister in a wheelchair cannot make footprints. Are you okay on that? &gt;&gt; Agreeing on that? Those are just facts. But the people that know their God will do exploits. &gt;&gt; Will make use of the power of God. So the prophet says, "You in a wheelchair and you that are in the stretcher, God promised you healing. You'll have to fight for every inch. &gt;&gt; I don't like fighting. You better fight against Satan &gt;&gt; cuz he's fighting against you. Whether he comes with a nice wrapping paper, with a nice icing on the cake, it's still from the devil. &gt;&gt; But remember, the devil will make you fight with the sword of God for every inch. But remember footprints is possession. Whosoever your foot treads that I give unto you, every step you can make, you know, to gets me that gets me feeling really religious. All the land that your feet will tread upon in the promised land is yours. &gt;&gt; And it's the same for every believer. tonight. &gt;&gt; So I'm asking saints. &gt;&gt; Can we testify? Can we take another step of faith in the impossibility? I can have a child. Abraham giving glory to God. Having a dead child saying having many problems, school, work, physical problems, mental problems, those are facts. But God tells you tonight, just say thus, say the Lord, the word of God, &gt;&gt; and go claim your God-given privilege. And then you will say, "All is well." &gt;&gt; And we stand to our feet. &gt;&gt; All is well. &gt;&gt; They had to fight for every inch all the way. But they had the promise of the victory. &gt;&gt; You have the promise of the victory because he told us already, "We are his victory." Saints of God, there's so much word that God has given. He has given us himself. We ought to be the happiest. &gt;&gt; The happiest people in the world. &gt;&gt; So why can't we act like it? &gt;&gt; And I'm not saying acting to be an actor. I'm say acting as a real believer because God is still a miracle working God. Do you know that song? There is power in the name of Jesus. He can play softly. The prophet he send he's talking about the spies that were sent out in the country. Only two had the testimony. How many will have a testimony tonight? That all is well. Brother David, yes. I do not know your problem. But I know what God told us. You have no feelings for me. I do have feelings for you. I have so much love for you. But I want to talk to you about a greater love, even more greater love that God has for us that he says, "Come unto me all ye that are heavy laden. Come unto me. Give it to me. I'll give you shalom. All is shalom. All is well. How is it possible? I don't know. How is it possible that a dead can? I don't know. The same as how is it possible that God said let it be and there was &gt;&gt; the same as God said you are my son. Me? Yes. I chose you. You're You're my diamonds. You're my jewels. Now it's up to you to reflect my glory. Deity is not in heaven. It's in you. The prophet says 10 of them said we can do it. Oh my. The opposition was great. The opposition is so great. How many times in services we don't dare to take a step of faith we don't dare I was listening on the plane my it struck me but Abraham he was talking in the service it is I about Elijah and says who will I send and he he says if there's anybody who wants to come and to say who will who will I hand and one man comes forward. It's a whole Lord God, God bless you. One man is standing here. Think of it. The prophet talking to the audience. And then he says, I'm going to make it real, very real to you now, cuz he is here. Sometimes people don't realize that he's here. Brother David, I don't feel you don't you don't need to feel you believe. And then he says, going to make it very real, that wasn't brother Brandon. Says, you sister, you have this, that, that, you brother, that's your name. That's your name. This is your trouble. Discernment going on. Only God knew. because he was in his heart. He said the preaching of the word, the word is so rich, but how do we react to how do we respond to that word? Are we willing to say, "Send me, Lord. Put me on the front line so our pastor can I'm I'm taking the front line now so he can rest on saints in the army. We need one another. &gt;&gt; We need one another.

They said the walls are too high, and that's true. He says they were walled up people and they were so big till we look like grasshopper to them. That's true. But you see that 10 of them were theologians. They were looking at what they could see intellectually. But Joshua and Caleb were looking at the promises of God. And I and it says God said, "I've already gi you the land. Go take it. Hallelujah. That's what the matter with the people tonight in divine healing and everything. It's yours. Go take it.
