[18:09] diabetes, fighting with the kidneys,
[18:11] Lord, as a man
[18:14] myself, I I I think I'd give up. But,
[18:17] Father, you [music] put a fight and he
[18:20] showed us how to fight. He's shown a
[18:22] bride how to fight, how to believe God's
[18:24] word. [music] And so, Father, we pray
[18:27] that you just give him the strength in
[18:29] his body. And Lord, just Sister Kim
[18:31] Weekes, just talk [music] to her today.
[18:34] And

[27:39] and there'll [music] slow down
[27:44] and there [singing] is
[27:47] a land.
[27:58] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[28:56] &gt;&gt; Once my clothes [music and singing] were
[28:58] ragged,
[29:00] the world looked down on me. [music]
[29:05] I had no hope for tomorrow, [singing]
[29:09] nor for eternity.
[29:12] [music]
[29:14] Then grace came [singing] with mercy
[29:19] and [music] heard this orphan's plea.
[29:24] Now I've been [singing]
[29:26] adopted
[29:29] from bondage. [music] I've been set
[29:31] free.
[29:33] Now I'm [singing]
[29:34] no longer [music]
[29:36] open.
[29:39] Jesus [singing] has rescued me.
[29:43] &gt;&gt; [music]
[29:43] &gt;&gt; My garments no longer [singing]
[29:46] are tattered.
[29:48] My family is royalty. [music]
[29:53] I came so empty.
[29:58] No place [music] to call my home.
[30:03] No one to really [singing]
[30:06] love me.
[30:08] But now [music] look what I [singing]
[30:11] earn.
[30:13] For I'm feasting on [music] the mana
[30:18] that comes from God [singing] on high.
[30:23] And there is no shortage. [music]
[30:28] There is [singing] a passive.
[30:33] Now I'm no [singing] longer [music] an
[30:36] orphan.
[30:38] Jesus has rescued [music and singing]
[30:40] me.
[30:42] My garments no longer [singing] are
[30:45] tatter.
[30:47] My family [music]
[30:49] is royalty. [singing]
[30:52] For [music] my family is royalty.
[30:58] [music]
[31:00] [applause]
[31:07] Amen. You believe that this evening?
[31:10] &gt;&gt; Won't be long our garments won't be
[31:12] tattered anymore. We'll be in a city,
[31:15] streets of gold.
[31:17] &gt;&gt; All glory. Hallelujah. Let's stand at
[31:19] this time. Let's sing that song. Forever
[31:22] God is forever.

[31:44] We'll sing [music] praise.
[31:49] We'll sing [music] praise
[31:54] with a mighty hand. In our stress
[31:57] hearts, his love endures forever.
[32:01] [music]
[32:03] For the life that's been that's been
[32:06] reborn, his love endures forever.
[32:12] We sing praise.

[35:08] Amen.
[35:10] You believe that tonight? That God is
[35:12] faithful. Amen. Isn't it a wonderful
[35:15] hour to be a Christian? [music] Amen. To
[35:17] be alive. We we welcome you here tonight
[35:20] and trust you've come expecting this
[35:22] weekend [music] that God will do great
[35:24] things amongst us. And Amen. If you have
[35:26] your Bibles, we just like to look in the
[35:28] book of Joel chapter 2 tonight.
[35:31] Joel chapter 2 and verse 25 and Isaiah
[35:34] chapter 54.
[35:36] Amen.
[36:05] Joel chapter 2 verse 25.
[36:11] While you're just making your way there,
[36:12] let's just talk to the author of his
[36:15] word tonight. Lord Jesus, we come before
[36:17] you tonight, Lord, and we humble
[36:20] ourselves before the great I am. Lord,
[36:22] we recognize, Lord Jesus, that we are
[36:25] completely insufficient without the Holy
[36:28] Spirit, Lord Jesus. You said in your
[36:31] word that without me, you can do
[36:32] nothing. And we realize, Lord Jesus,
[36:35] that we had a prophet that would stand
[36:36] right here in this hour and would speak
[36:39] and he would say, "Now you know that I'm
[36:41] waiting on something." Father, we
[36:44] realize that we are completely helpless
[36:45] and hopeless without the grace and the
[36:48] mercy of the Lord Jesus Christ. But we
[36:51] pray tonight that your Holy Spirit would
[36:53] come upon your children. You would just
[36:55] allow the the wings of the Almighty God
[36:59] to rest upon us, Lord Jesus, like a a
[37:02] mother eagle covering its eagllets. We
[37:04] pray, Father, that you would overshadow
[37:06] us with your Holy Spirit and birth us,
[37:09] Lord Jesus, into the the Holies of
[37:12] Holies, Father, that we would see you
[37:14] high and lifted up. For truly, Lord, our
[37:17] desire as Christians, Father, is to be
[37:20] made more like you, Lord, there's a lot
[37:22] of things that we could look out there
[37:24] in the world and we could see a lot of
[37:25] things being made in this hour. But
[37:27] Lord, we want to be made like you with
[37:30] everything that's within us, our
[37:31] children, our our aspects of our family
[37:34] life, our Christianity. We desire, Lord
[37:38] Jesus, to be close to you so much,
[37:40] Father, that one of these days we'll
[37:42] take a walk like Enoch did, and we'll
[37:45] walk right off of this world, Father,
[37:47] and we'll live a life that had been so
[37:49] pleasing to you, Father, that you could
[37:51] not leave us here. So, Father, as we go
[37:53] through thy word tonight, we invite you,
[37:56] Father, to be the author of it and take
[37:59] us through it. Lord Jesus, guide us
[38:00] tonight. We pray in the name of Jesus
[38:03] Christ. And the bride said,
[38:06] &gt;&gt; "Amen." Joel chapter 2 and verse 25.
[38:11] And I will restore to you the years that
[38:14] the locust hath eaten, the cankerworm,
[38:18] the caterpillar, and the Palmerworm. my
[38:22] great army which I sent amongst you.
[38:25] Isaiah 54 verse 1-7.
[38:29] We'll be reading it from the amplified
[38:31] version again.
[38:48] Amen. Do you have it this evening?
[38:50] The Bible says, "Shout for joy, O barren
[38:53] one. She who has not given birth, break
[38:57] forth into joyful shouting and rejoice."
[39:02] I love that. Don't you rejoice? I
[39:05] believe if there ever was an hour for
[39:07] the bride of Christ to rejoice, it's
[39:09] right now. She who has not gone into
[39:13] labor with child, for with the spiritual
[39:16] sons of the desolate one will be more
[39:18] numerous than the sons of the married
[39:20] woman, saith the Lord. Enlarge the size
[39:24] of your tent to make room for more
[39:27] children. Stretch out the curtains of
[39:30] your dwellings. Do not spare them.
[39:33] Lengthen your tent ropes and make your
[39:35] peg stakes firm in the ground. For you
[39:39] will spread out to the right and to the
[39:41] left. Tell the devil to give you some
[39:44] elbow room.
[39:46] And your descendants will take
[39:47] possession of nations and will inhabit
[39:50] the deserted cities. Do not fear for you
[39:53] will not be put to shame. And do not
[39:56] feel humiliated or ashamed for you will
[39:58] not be disgraced. Somebody say, "Praise
[40:01] the Lord. For you will not forget the
[40:04] shame of your youth. For you will forget
[40:06] the shame of your youth. And you will no
[40:09] longer remember the disgrace of your
[40:10] widowhood. For your husband is your
[40:13] maker. The Lord of hosts is his name.
[40:16] And your redeemer is the holy one of
[40:19] Israel who is called the son who is
[40:22] called the God of the whole earth. For
[40:25] the Lord has called you like a wife who
[40:28] has been abandoned, grieved in spirit,
[40:31] and like a wife married in her youth,
[40:33] when she is later rejected and scorned,
[40:36] says your God. For a brief moment, I
[40:38] abandon you, but with great compassion
[40:41] and mercy, I will gather you to myself
[40:46] again. Amen. May God bless his word
[40:48] tonight. You may be seated here tonight
[40:51] in the presence of the Lord. Have you
[40:53] come expecting this weekend?
[40:55] &gt;&gt; I'd like to just for a few minutes
[40:57] tonight just to rebuild on some things
[40:59] that we were speaking last weekend and
[41:01] and continue our thought on I will
[41:03] restore and restoring the barren. We
[41:06] look here and we just look at this
[41:08] definition of barrenness again. It is
[41:11] the quality of not producing its kind of
[41:14] want or the power of conception. It it
[41:18] means to be unfruitful. It means to be
[41:21] sterile and have infertility. It's the
[41:24] quality of not producing at all whether
[41:27] in small quantities or in big
[41:29] quantities. We you see that it means it
[41:32] it baroness means want of invention or
[41:35] the want of power of producing anything
[41:38] new. And I I love this this part of the
[41:41] definition of it. It is defect of
[41:44] emotion, sensibility or ferveny as the
[41:48] baroness of devotion. You begin to think
[41:51] about this thought and there's many ways
[41:53] that you could look at the thought on
[41:55] barrenness. But what you what barreness
[41:58] can look like is because barrenness a
[42:01] lot of times is broader than we would
[42:04] look at maybe at a womb of a of a
[42:06] mother. It can appear many of times as
[42:09] physical barrenness where the it has the
[42:12] inability to bring forth life or to
[42:15] produce fruit of the ground. Then there
[42:17] is when you look in the Bible you will
[42:19] see a spiritual barrenness that God
[42:21] would lace throughout his word that
[42:23] there would be dryness and there would
[42:25] be times of silence and times of
[42:27] weariness when people are in a state of
[42:29] barrenness where God is not go where
[42:31] where they feel like God has left them.
[42:34] And then there's a time where you would
[42:36] look and you would see where where
[42:38] people would see barrenness in their
[42:39] time of a relationship with the Almighty
[42:42] where it would look like they're when
[42:44] they are in a spot when God is delaying
[42:46] his promise to come to pass or they feel
[42:49] like they're they're being isolated or
[42:52] they are in a space of of brokenness.
[42:55] And then there you can see that there
[42:56] are times and seasons of seasonal
[42:59] barrenness. When you look in there and
[43:02] see that a promise has been spoken over
[43:04] a certain situation, but nothing has yet
[43:07] just happened. But we realize that God
[43:09] addresses every type of barrenness
[43:12] through his word. Can you say amen
[43:14] tonight? And we realize that we we are
[43:16] facing an enemy that he likes to make us
[43:20] and make us feel like we are not
[43:22] producing what God has intended us to
[43:25] do. But we also realize that there is a
[43:27] baroness where the enemy comes in and
[43:30] attacks the land or attacks the field or
[43:32] attacks a a womb and tries to lock up
[43:35] that womb or that field from being able
[43:38] to produce and to bring forth. But we
[43:40] look and also see that God allows
[43:42] Baroness in certain conditions in
[43:45] certain cases. You remember when Aimilec
[43:48] had had taken Sarah to be his wife. You
[43:51] remember there that God had visited AMC
[43:54] in a dream and told him said now if you
[43:56] don't restore the man his wife then I'm
[43:58] going to lock up all the wounds of all
[44:00] your city. So God was telling Aimilec
[44:03] that if you don't release her that your
[44:05] kingdom will become completely perilous.
[44:08] they'll they'll completely not be able
[44:10] to produce and not go forward. Your your
[44:12] kingdom will be a complete demise. And
[44:14] you also remember that there was a woman
[44:17] by the name of Michelle that was David's
[44:19] wife. How that that that was David's
[44:21] first wife, his first love. And you
[44:23] remember when David was dancing 17 miles
[44:26] backwards under true worship because he
[44:28] saw the message of the hour coming back
[44:30] to its rightful position again. And she
[44:33] looked out there upon David in that true
[44:35] worship and she made fun of it. And you
[44:37] remember that in that MOMENT THAT GOD
[44:40] SPOKE AND HE CURSED HER WOMB THAT SHE
[44:42] COULD no further bring forth children
[44:45] from her own womb no more. So we realize
[44:48] that there is A BARONESS THAT GOD
[44:50] ALLOWS. BUT WE ALSO REALIZE this that we
[44:53] are living in an hour where Jesus speaks
[44:56] about the hour that you and I are living
[44:57] in where we see that there is a
[44:59] spiritual barrenness that is upon the
[45:01] face OF THE EARTH. YOU look at it and
[45:03] you see the condition of mothers and you
[45:05] see these things. Do you know that our
[45:07] sisters that you can take great courage
[45:09] is that this is the hour that Jesus
[45:12] talked about in the book of Luke chapter
[45:14] 23 and 27. The Bible said that there
[45:17] followed him a great company of people
[45:19] and of women which also bewailed and
[45:22] lamented him. But Jesus turning unto
[45:25] them and said, "Daughters of Jerusalem,
[45:28] weep not for me." Hallelujah. But weep
[45:31] for yourselves and for your children.
[45:34] But for behold, THE DAYS ARE COMING IN
[45:36] WHICH they shall say, "Blessed are the
[45:38] barren, and the wounds that shall never
[45:40] that never bear, and the paths which
[45:42] never GAVE SUCK." THEN SHALL they begin
[45:45] to say, "The mountains fall upon us, and
[45:47] the hills to cover us." Now, brother
[45:50] picks that up in the invisible union. He
[45:53] says, speaking of the day that women
[45:55] would no more want children. They want a
[45:57] dog or a cat or SOMETHING LIKE THAT, BUT
[46:00] SHE DON'T WANT ANY CHILDREN ANYMORE.
[46:02] WHY? SHE'S an old mother hubard. IF SHE
[46:04] HAS A CHILD, SHE DON'T WANT That's the
[46:07] That's the remarks of Hollywood. It
[46:09] don't want this woman to it does it
[46:11] don't want the his woman to be an old
[46:13] mother hubard. OH, SHE'LL HAVE SOME KIND
[46:16] of an operation performed on herself
[46:18] that'll keep her from having children.
[46:20] THEY DON'T WANT NO CHILDREN. JESUS SPOKE
[46:24] OF IT. WHAT DID HE SAY? AT THAT time
[46:26] they shall begin to cry for the rocks
[46:28] and the mountains to fall on them.
[46:31] NOTICE HE SAID SHE'LL PRACTICE BIRTH
[46:33] CONTROL SO THAT SHE CAN go to parties.
[46:36] SHE CAN'T BE BOTHERED WITH A BABY
[46:38] NURSING HER. It'll disform her when
[46:41] she's pregnantated. It'll be it'll
[46:42] disform her. She won't look like she's
[46:45] you like she USED TO. HALLELUJAH. AND
[46:47] HER HUSBAND ignorant enough to let her
[46:49] go that way. SHE WON'T GIVE HIM A CHILD.
[46:52] JESUS SPOKE OF IT. HE SAID THAT THAT
[46:55] WOMEN WHEN THEY GET THERE that when they
[46:57] were doing this is at the time when they
[46:59] to go to crying for the rocks to FALL ON
[47:01] THEM. HE SAID IT'S the coming of the
[47:04] Lord. WHEN YOU SEE THESE DAYS ARE
[47:07] COMING, YOU RECOGNIZE, SISTERS, when you
[47:09] are desiring to be A MOTHER. YOU LOOK
[47:11] AND REALIZE THAT YOU'RE IN THE GREATEST
[47:14] TIME OF YOUR LIFE. HALLELUJAH. YOU'RE IN
[47:17] THE GREATEST TIME OF YOUR LIFE. YOU'RE
[47:19] AT THE COMING OF THE LORD. IT MAY NOT BE
[47:22] A GREAT TIME FOR SOME OF YOU, BUT FOR
[47:24] ME, IT'S THE BEST TIME IN THE WORLD TO
[47:26] BE LIVING AT. I KNOW FOR SOME OF YOU
[47:28] MOTHERS, it's never been able to BRING
[47:30] FORTH AND DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES IN
[47:32] YOUR LIFE. BUT YOU LOOK OUT THERE IN THE
[47:34] WORLD AND YOU SEE ALL THESE
[47:36] DISCREPANCIES THAT ARE TAKING PLACE. BUT
[47:38] I WANT YOU TO KNOW, IT'S A TIME TO
[47:40] REJOICE.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; IT'S A TIME TO REJOICE. IT'S THE COMING
[47:44] OF THE LORD.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; It's amazing time to be living.
[47:50] Absolutely amazing time because women
[47:53] are not wanting to bring forth
[47:56] and the church is in the same condition.
[48:00] But I thank God for good Christian
[48:02] mamas. I thank God for our sisters that
[48:05] long to be mothers. and you look out
[48:07] there and you see these godly examples
[48:09] of what it's like to be have a mother
[48:12] like like Moses's mother that would
[48:14] raise him up there and teach him of
[48:16] those different things and would raise
[48:18] him up to realize that he was born for A
[48:20] PURPOSE. I THANK GOD FOR women that
[48:22] desire to still bring forth children
[48:24] because I believe that there is
[48:25] something when you study THE SCRIPTURES
[48:27] WHETHER YOU KNOW HOW TO BE a mama or not
[48:29] or whether you know how to be a daddy or
[48:31] not. I know. I know this is THAT IF YOU
[48:34] READ THIS BIBLE, it'll teach you how to
[48:36] be a mama. It'll teach you how to be a
[48:38] daddy. IF YOU COULD JUST GO BACK TO
[48:40] SPENDING TIME WITH THE AUTHOR OF THE
[48:42] WORD, IT'LL TEACH YOU how to be a REAL
[48:44] MAMA. YOU LOOK AT THESE SISTERS OUT
[48:46] HERE. WHAT GIVE THEM THAT DESIRE TO BE A
[48:48] MOTHER? IT WAS OUR HEAVENLY FATHER THAT
[48:51] PUT THAT ON THE INSIDE OF THEM BECAUSE
[48:52] GOD LONGS TO BE A FATHER. HE LOVED
[48:56] FATHERHOOD. SO, HE HAD HIMSELF A CHILD.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, I love it. I LOVE CHILDREN.
[49:02] THERE'S SOME PEOPLE THAT GET so
[49:03] disturbed by children. They get so
[49:05] disturbed because I WENT INTO A PLACE
[49:07] ONE TIME AND I vowed I'd never go back
[49:09] there. It had a little sign or little
[49:10] place or a restaurant that said no
[49:13] children are welcome. I thought, well,
[49:15] this ain't a place for me.
[49:17] Ain't a place for me. IF THEY IF MY
[49:19] CHILDREN AIN'T WELCOME, then I ain't
[49:20] welcome
[49:22] &gt;&gt; because I'm the biggest kid in my
[49:24] family.
[49:26] BUT YOU KNOW, THERE'S SOMETHING POWERFUL
[49:28] WHEN YOU GO TO STUDYING OUT CHILDREN.
[49:29] There's a lot of people There's a lot of
[49:31] people that don't like children in
[49:32] church. But I'll say this, IF YOU AIN'T
[49:34] GOT CHILDREN IN CHURCH, YOU GOT A DEAD
[49:35] CHURCH.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of people THAT GET
[49:39] DISTURBED BECAUSE CHILDREN playing in
[49:40] churches. Well, there's a place, AND
[49:43] THAT'S YOUR JOB AS MOTHER AND FATHERS to
[49:45] flick them on top of the head and get
[49:46] them back in line. But I'll SAY THIS, IT
[49:49] DON'T BOTHER ME one bit.
[49:51] It don't bother me one bit. If we don't
[49:53] have those little ones crawling around
[49:54] and playing all over the place, THEN
[49:56] THIS PLACE IS DEAD.
[49:59] WELL, if you don't want children in
[50:00] church, well, better go down there to
[50:01] the Methodist church WHERE THEY AIN'T
[50:03] THEY AIN'T GOT NO CHILDREN. THEY AIN'T
[50:04] GOT NO YOUTH. THEY AIN'T GOT NO PEOPLE
[50:06] THAT WANT TO SERVE GOD.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, WE GOT THIS YOUTH GROUP AROUND
[50:10] AROUND HERE, BUT I DO THAT EVERY ONCE IN
[50:12] A WHILE, BUT THAT AIN'T A PROGRAM TO
[50:13] KEEP CHILDREN IN CHURCH. THAT'S JUST AN
[50:16] ADDED BENEFIT TO THEIR CAME TO CHURCH
[50:18] AND BEING BLESSING BY OTHERS, BUT THAT
[50:21] AIN'T SOMETHING TO KEEP THEM IN LINE.
[50:24] I know a personal FRIEND OF MINE. I KNOW
[50:27] A PERSONAL FRIEND OF MINE THAT IS PAID.
[50:29] HE IS A PAID GUY TO GO AROUND TO MAKE
[50:31] SURE HE IS A PERSONAL SOCIALIZER of the
[50:35] church to make sure that PEOPLE ARE
[50:37] INVOLVED AND THEY KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.
[50:39] IT'S A PROGRAM TO KEEP THEM IN CHURCH.
[50:42] But I found out the only program that I
[50:44] need here for GOSPEL LIGHTHOUSE IS TO
[50:46] PREACH the message of the hour.
[50:50] I hear people say, "HOW DO YOU GET YOUR
[50:52] YOUNG PEOPLE TO ACT THAT WAY AND HAVE
[50:54] THAT KIND OF RESPECT AND DEMONSTRATE
[50:56] THAT KIND OF CHARACTER?" WELL, THERE'S
[50:58] NOTHING I DID. ALL I SIMPLY DID WAS
[51:00] PREACH THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. IT
[51:02] DOESN'T HAVE ONE THING TO DO WITH WHAT
[51:04] BROTHER RON DID OR BROTHER HOMER DID.
[51:06] IT'S THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Don't you love children?
[51:13] &gt;&gt; I love what the Bible said in Psalms 127
[51:16] and three. Lo children are inheritance
[51:19] of the Lord and the fruit of the womb is
[51:21] his reward. Psalms 128 and3 said, "Thy
[51:24] wife shall be as fruitful vine by the
[51:27] sides of thine house. Thy children like
[51:30] the olive plants round about thy table."
[51:33] God loves his children. AND YOU LOOK AT
[51:36] MA MARK 10:16, IT SAID THAT HE TOOK THEM
[51:40] IN his arms, the little children, and he
[51:42] put his hands UPON THEM AND HE BLESSED
[51:45] THEM. GOD JESUS ALMIGHTY LOVED TO bring
[51:50] children unto him.
[51:53] So Jesus was a youth leader. LUKE 18 AND
[51:57] 16. BUT JESUS CALLED THEM UNTO HIM AND
[52:00] SAID SUFFER THE LITTLE CHILDREN TO COME
[52:03] UNTO ME. YOU SEE THERE IS SOMETHING
[52:05] POWERFUL. THERE IS SOMETHING POWERFUL IN
[52:09] GOD'S MIND ABOUT BEING A CHILD.
[52:13] GOD LOVES CHILDLIKE FAITH. THERE'S
[52:17] SOMETHING POWERFUL WHEN YOU GO TO
[52:18] STUDYING CHILDLIKE FAITH. NOW, CHILDLIKE
[52:21] FAITH IS NOT CHILDISH FAITH, BUT
[52:23] CHILDLIKE FAITH IS TO BE LIKE A CHILD.
[52:26] NOTICE WHAT JESUS SAID IN MATTHEW 8:3,
[52:28] "VERILY, I say unto you, EXCEPT YOU BE
[52:31] CONVERTED AND BECOME AS LITTLE CHILDREN,
[52:34] YOU SHALL NOT ENTER IN TO THE KINGDOM OF
[52:37] GOD." SO, WHAT DOES CHILDLIKE FAITH LOOK
[52:40] LIKE?
[52:42] What does it look like? Do you want to
[52:43] GET A PICTURE OF WHAT CHILDLIKE FAITH
[52:46] LOOKS LIKE? GO TO MATTHEW 21:16 THAT IT
[52:49] SAID, "OUT OF THE MOUTH OF BABES AND
[52:51] SUCKLINGS, THOU HAS PERFECTED PRAISE."
[52:55] SO IF YOU WANT CHILDLIKE FAITH, THEN YOU
[52:58] GOT TO GO BACK TO PERFECT PRAISE AGAIN.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, CHILDLIKE FAITH IS NOT
[53:05] IGNORANCE.
[53:07] CHILDLIKE FAITH IS NOT IGNORANCE, BUT
[53:09] CHILDLIKE FAITH IS TRUST WITHOUT
[53:12] COMPLICATION. IT'S LIKE I WAS SPEAKING
[53:14] TO YOU A FEW WEEKENDS AGO ON TOUCH OF
[53:17] JESUS, TOUCHING JESUS LIKE THAT LITTLE
[53:19] BITTY BABY THAT IF IT'S EVER GET PUT
[53:22] BACK IN THE HANDS OF ITS MAMA, IT GETS
[53:24] LAID THERE ON THAT BOSOM OF THAT MOTHER.
[53:27] THAT THAT THAT LITTLE BABY HAS FULL
[53:29] CONFIDENCE THAT THAT MOTHER IS GOING TO
[53:32] SATISFY ALL OF ITS NEEDS. THAT'S WHY
[53:35] ABRAHAM RESTED OVER ON THE BOSOM OF EL
[53:38] SHADI BECAUSE HE KNEW THAT HE COULD LAY
[53:41] UPON HIM AND OUT OF HIM HE WOULD PULL A
[53:44] NEW BODY.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; You see now you're going to produce
[53:50] something.
[53:52] If you're going to have a wedlock then
[53:54] you're going to produce something. He
[53:56] went on to say in invisible union he
[53:59] said if a woman won't have a baby for
[54:01] her husband she'll take a dog or a cat
[54:03] something. He said she's got to mother
[54:05] something.
[54:06] It's her nature. But to bear a child for
[54:09] her husband and raise it to the service
[54:12] of God, that's entirely all out of her
[54:14] line. She should Oh, she'd be so
[54:16] disgraced if she did by her sinloving
[54:19] society of this 1965 type of woman. He
[54:23] said it's a TRUE TYPE OF THE modern
[54:25] church today. Neither does the modern
[54:27] church want any of these here.
[54:29] Screaming, shouting, tongue speaking.
[54:31] Acts 2:38, young is around her. Yeah,
[54:33] she don't want any of them whooping,
[54:35] crying, and screaming. AMEN. HALLELUJAH.
[54:37] WHY SUCH A CHILD WOULD IMMEDIATELY PUT
[54:39] HER out of HER DENOMINATIONS? THEY HAD
[54:41] ONLY ONE. THEY HAD ONE LIKE THAT IN THE
[54:44] ONE of the churches. WHY? THEY'D THROW
[54:46] HER OUT RIGHT QUICK. WHY ARE YOU LETTING
[54:48] SUCH STUFF AS THIS GO ALONG? SO, you
[54:50] see, she's pregnantated with something.
[54:52] NOTICE SHE'S PREGNANTATED WITH SOMETHING
[54:55] BECAUSE SHE'S BRINGING FORTH MEMBERS all
[54:57] the time. But she don't want NONE OF
[54:59] THEM SCREAMING, HOLLERING, BLABBERING.
[55:00] ACTS 2:38, MISERABLE CREATURES THAT SHE
[55:03] THINKS THEY ARE. NOTICE THIS IS NOT
[55:07] [screaming] WHAT GOD THINKS, BUT THIS IS
[55:09] WHAT THE MODERN CHURCH THINKS OF HER,
[55:11] that she thinks they are. It would
[55:14] certainly embarrass her. It would ruin
[55:16] her and her uneducated, ETHICAL,
[55:18] SCIENTIFIC SOCIETY CHURCH THAT SHE
[55:20] BELONGED TO HERE. THEY WOULD THROW HER
[55:22] OUT AT THE NEXT council council. She
[55:25] can't have it. She don't want to be
[55:27] pregnantated with the word because
[55:29] that's the only kind that the word can
[55:32] bring forth, born of THE SPIRIT OF GOD.
[55:34] IT HAS A SPIRIT OF GOD IN IT. NO
[55:36] INTELLECTUAL CHURCH JOIN AND CREEK
[55:38] GOING, BOBBED HAIR, PAINTED FACE.
[55:40] THERE'S NO SUCH THING AT IT AT ALL. YOU
[55:43] DON'T FIND THAT IN the word of God. You
[55:45] find an oldfashioned sanctified Holy
[55:48] Ghost filled child born of the spirit.
[55:51] GOD SCREAMING, HOLLERING, SHOUTING,
[55:53] PRAISING GOD.
[55:55] HALLELUJAH.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; THAT'S one of my favorite quotes
[55:59] cuz I don't fit in with that modern
[56:00] world. But you notice the power of
[56:03] deception right here. Notice she IS
[56:06] PREGNANTATED BECAUSE SHE'S BRINGING
[56:07] FORTH MEMBERS ALL THE TIME. AND THE
[56:09] CHURCH THINKS THAT SHE'S CONSTANTLY
[56:11] GROWING BECAUSE THERE'S MORE MEMBERS
[56:13] THAN EVER BEFORE, a million more and all
[56:15] these DIFFERENT THINGS AND ALWAYS HAVING
[56:17] A CONSTANT THING. BUT THEY'RE NEVER
[56:19] PRODUCING LIFE.
[56:22] Are you with me? THEY'RE NOT PRODUCING
[56:23] LIFE, SO THEY'RE BRINGING FORTH HYBRID
[56:26] MEMBERS. SO, WE RECOGNIZE THAT SHE IS
[56:29] BEING PREGNANT WITH THE WRONG KIND OF
[56:31] SEED because if it was true seed, then
[56:35] it would manifest the same life that
[56:38] came from the husband. So, we recognize
[56:41] it is in our mothers
[56:43] to bring forth life. It's in our mothers
[56:46] to mother something.
[56:48] It's the same way on the inside of the
[56:50] bride of Jesus Christ. She can't explain
[56:53] it, but she's wanting to bring forth
[56:55] something. She can't explain it, but
[56:58] she's still hungering for something. She
[57:00] can't explain it, but she's still
[57:01] wanting the supernatural. She can't
[57:03] explain it, but she's wanting to produce
[57:05] the supernatural. She can't explain it,
[57:07] BUT SHE STILL BELIEVES IN THE
[57:09] SUPERNATURAL. SHE STILL BELIEVES IN
[57:11] HEALING. SHE STILL BELIEVES IN SIGNS AND
[57:13] WONDERS FOLLOWING THE CHURCH OF THE
[57:14] LIVING GOD. SHE CAN'T EXPLAIN IT BECAUSE
[57:17] IT'S SOMETHING ON THE INSIDE OF HER.
[57:24] He went on to say in a spoken word is
[57:26] the original seed. He said, "Now Abram,
[57:29] excuse me, Adam's bride could not wait."
[57:32] He said, "BUT SHE MINGLED HER SEED
[57:35] ILLEGALLY." ILLEGALLY. We are supposed
[57:37] to believe God's word AND THAT ALONE.
[57:39] NOW, BRETHREN, HERE AND on the tape, DO
[57:41] YOU SEE WHY I'M CONTENDING FOR THAT
[57:44] WORD? word by word. So if we're going to
[57:47] bring forth anything, THEN IT'S GOT TO
[57:49] BE BUILT UPON THE WORD. JESUS BELIEVED
[57:53] ALL THAT WAS WRITTEN OF HIM AND HE
[57:56] MANIFESTED EVERYTHING THAT WAS WRITTEN
[57:58] OF HIM. So if we're going to live IN
[58:00] THIS HOUR, THEN WE'VE GOT TO MANIFEST
[58:02] the word that is for our portion. WE'VE
[58:06] WE GOT TO WAIT ON IT. But Eve couldn't
[58:10] wait.
[58:11] She got in a hurry.
[58:14] How many times have you got in a hurry?
[58:18] How many times did you think that God
[58:20] needed your help
[58:23] BECAUSE YOU HAD SOMETHING ON THE INSIDE
[58:25] OF YOU AND JUST BECAUSE IT'S A RIGHTEOUS
[58:28] DESIRE DOESN'T MAKE IT ALWAYS RIGHT.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? TRYING TO DO GOD A
[58:34] SERVICE WITHOUT BEING IN his will. SO
[58:37] SOMETIMES IT'S THE RIGHT THING, BUT IT'S
[58:40] AT THE WRONG TIME.
[58:42] But notice, Eve couldn't wait. There was
[58:45] something on the inside of her brother
[58:47] Doug, where she longed to be a mother
[58:49] because God gave her that great desire
[58:52] to be a mother,
[58:55] &gt;&gt; but she couldn't wait. But I love what
[58:59] the prophet said, and it is the rising
[59:00] of the sun. AND GOD KNOWS, HALLELUJAH,
[59:03] HE'S GOT A PRESENT PREDESTINATED FOR
[59:05] ORDAINED CHURCH. HE KNOWS HE'S GOT SONS
[59:07] AND DAUGHTERS AND A BRIDE WAITING. A
[59:10] BRIDE WAITING SOMEWHERE. WHEN THE HOLY
[59:13] SPIRIT BEGINS TO FLY OVER IT, THAT WAVE
[59:15] CHIEF, OH MY, HE'S THE SAME YESTERDAY,
[59:17] TODAY, AND FOREVER. NOT SOME MYTHICAL
[59:20] STORY, BUT A REALITY.
[59:23] YOU'RE NOT OUT THERE GETTING AHEAD OF
[59:24] THE PROGRAM, BUT YOU'RE WAITING FOR THE
[59:27] WAVE SHEATH, THE MESSAGE TO COME ACROSS
[59:30] YOUR LIFE TO PRODUCE SOMETHING THAT YOU
[59:33] NEVER COULD.
[59:36] If we would have WEIGHED IT,
[59:39] &gt;&gt; WE WOULDN'T have been in this chaos.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; What are you talking about, Brother
[59:45] Andrew?
[59:47] If you want to break barrenness, you got
[59:49] to go through God's program.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; What are you saying, Brother Andrew? I'm
[59:55] saying this is THAT IF YOU'LL STAY IN
[59:58] LINE, IF YOU'LL STAY RIGHT IN LINE WITH
[1:00:00] GOD'S WORD, THE PROPHET SAID STAY IN
[1:00:03] LINE. YOU NOTICE THERE'S A BRIDE
[1:00:05] WAITING. THERE'S A BRIDE WAITING.
[1:00:07] THERE'S A BRIDE IN POSITION. THERE'S A
[1:00:09] BRIDE THAT'S GOING TO BRING FORTH.
[1:00:10] THERE'S A BRIDE THAT'S GOING TO MANIFEST
[1:00:12] GOD'S POWER. AND WHEN YOU GET TO A SPOT
[1:00:15] WHERE YOU ARE DEALING WITH CONSTANTLY A
[1:00:18] BARONESS IN YOUR LIFE WHERE YOU HAVE
[1:00:21] MOMENTS OF HIGH SPOTS AND LOW SPOTS,
[1:00:23] WELL, BROTHER, YOU MIGHT AS WELL JUST GO
[1:00:25] AHEAD AND GET ON A ROLLER COASTER
[1:00:26] BECAUSE YOU'RE ALWAYS GOING TO HAVE THEM
[1:00:28] THINGS. BUT WHERE YOU BREAK IT AT IS
[1:00:31] WHEN YOU SPEND TIME WITH THE AUTHOR OF
[1:00:33] THIS WORD.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; Cuz there's a lot of people
[1:00:39] [panting]
[1:00:39] that look like the real deal. There's a
[1:00:42] lot of people that look like real seed.
[1:00:44] THERE'S A LOT OF people where the
[1:00:46] message of the hour was cast upon the
[1:00:48] ground, but it fell on rocks and it fell
[1:00:50] in thorns and it took the very life out
[1:00:52] of the seed.
[1:00:54] But God knows who's waiting.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; Notice he went on to say in a spoken
[1:01:01] word. HE SAID, "WHEN ADAM COME TO HIS
[1:01:03] WIFE, SHE WAS PREGNANT. SHE HAD DONE
[1:01:06] SOMETHING. SHE WAS MIXED. SHE WAS A
[1:01:08] HYBRID, a child, and had died. BUT WHEN
[1:01:11] JOSEPH COME TO HIS BRIDE, SHE WAS
[1:01:13] PREGNANTATED WITH LIFE." HALLELUJAH.
[1:01:17] ADAM'S WIFE OR HIS ADAM'S BRIDE BEFORE
[1:01:20] THEY COME TOGETHER JUST LIKE JOSEPH AND
[1:01:22] MARY JUST LIKE CHRIST IN THE CHURCH NOW.
[1:01:24] DO YOU SEE IT? AND BEFORE THEY COME
[1:01:26] TOGETHER, ADAM AND EVE, SHE WAS
[1:01:28] PREGNANTATED WITH A CORRUPT SEED FROM
[1:01:31] THE SERPENT. AND WHEN ADAM COME TO HIS
[1:01:33] WIFE, HE FOUND HER PREGNANT to death.
[1:01:35] Death how? Spiritually and physically
[1:01:38] dead. BUT WHEN JOSEPH THE HUMAN COME TO
[1:01:41] HIS WIFE, GLORY, HE SAID, I HE can't
[1:01:43] hardly hold her. She was pregnantated
[1:01:45] with life. THE WORD OF GOD, THE FLESH IN
[1:01:48] HER WOMB.
[1:01:51] WHAT A DIFFERENCE. WHAT A CONTRAST. WHEN
[1:01:53] ADAM WENT TO EVE, SHE WAS PREGNANTATED
[1:01:55] TO DEATH. BUT WHEN JOSEPH WENT TO MARY,
[1:01:58] WHAT DID HE FIND? SHE WAS PREGNANTATED
[1:02:01] WITH LIFE. WHEN CHRIST COME IN THIS
[1:02:03] HOUR, THIS MESSAGE BROKE THE BARNESS
[1:02:06] OVER YOUR LIFE.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT PREGNANTATED WITH DEATH.
[1:02:11] YOU'RE PREGNANTATED WITH LIFE.
[1:02:20] My goodness.
[1:02:23] How did the prophet say it? And your
[1:02:25] life is sealed off where no other life
[1:02:28] can get on the inside of there. There
[1:02:30] ain't no power that can get on the
[1:02:31] inside of that. No devil CAN GET IN
[1:02:33] THERE THAT CAN TORMENT you and sew a
[1:02:35] seed OF DISCREPANCY BECAUSE A MESSAGE
[1:02:37] HAS ALREADY BEEN SOWN. YOU'RE NOT GOING
[1:02:39] TO REJECT WHAT GOD HAS PUT ON THE INSIDE
[1:02:41] OF YOU.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Philippians 2:5 says, "Let
[1:02:46] this mind BE IN YOU WHICH WAS ALSO IN
[1:02:50] CHRIST JESUS." BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID IN
[1:02:52] A SPOKEN WORD, HE SAID, "IF YOU LET THE
[1:02:54] MIND OF A DENOMINATION come in, YOU'LL
[1:02:56] BE DENOMINATIONAL PREGNANT." HE SAID,
[1:02:58] "BUT IF YOU LET the mind of Christ come
[1:03:00] into you, HE CAN'T DENY HIS OWN WORD CUZ
[1:03:03] HE'S GOD. YOU BE PREGNANT WITH THE
[1:03:06] WORD."
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; THIS MESSAGE, THIS BRIDE IS NOT CARRYING
[1:03:10] AROUND SOME DOCTRINE. She's not carrying
[1:03:13] AROUND ANOTHER CHURCH. SHE'S NOT
[1:03:14] carrying around a different book. SHE'S
[1:03:16] CARRYING AROUND JESUS.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; LOOK AT YOUR NEIGHBOR. SAY, "I'M
[1:03:21] PREGNANT."
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; BROTHERS, that's the first time
[1:03:35] I believe we have defied all of science
[1:03:37] tonight.
[1:03:46] I'm pregnant
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; and I'm full term.
[1:04:06] That's funny, ain't it?
[1:04:10] But I'm pregnant.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; I'm pregnant.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; I got something on the inside of me
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; and I didn't put it there.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; I just got in position
[1:04:27] for a miracle to come by my way.
[1:04:30] Let me say this to you. You got yourself
[1:04:32] in position when the message of the hour
[1:04:34] come by your way.
[1:04:36] Let me say this TO YOU. THERE WAS
[1:04:37] NOTHING THAT YOU DID. YOU WAS ELECTED
[1:04:40] BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD TO BE
[1:04:42] PRED PREDESTINATED TO CARRY THIS MESSAGE
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; AND I'M PREGNANT AND I'M FULLTERM. AND
[1:04:50] LET ME SAY SOMETHING ON THE INSIDE. IT'S
[1:04:53] WORKING ON THE OUTSIDE.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; I'm pregnant.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; Mary couldn't hide it but for so long.
[1:05:04] There's a lot of people that's going
[1:05:05] around claiming that they're pregnant
[1:05:06] with the message,
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; but they ain't nothing showing on the
[1:05:11] outside.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; I got all you laughing, but now I got
[1:05:15] you where I want you.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; YOU SAID YOU WAS PREGNANT, BUT IS
[1:05:20] [screaming] YOUR LIFE SHOWING
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; WHAT YOU'RE PREGNANTATED WITH?
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; COME ON, SOMEBODY. AT SOME TIME IN YOUR
[1:05:29] LIFE, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH
[1:05:31] BIRTH PAINS AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
[1:05:33] GET INTO A SPOT WHERE THINGS ARE NOT
[1:05:35] COMFORTABLE.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; If you're pregnant, THEN THAT MEANS ONLY
[1:05:40] ONE THING THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
[1:05:42] HAVE BIRTH.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; SOMETHING HAS GOT TO COME OUT OF THE
[1:05:46] FRUIT OF THY WOMB. SOMETHING HAS GOT TO
[1:05:49] MANIFEST.
[1:05:52] AND TOO many times we produce stillborn
[1:05:55] children
[1:05:58] because we got churches or we go and we
[1:06:01] feel like we need a church
[1:06:04] that their spiritual phen thermometer is
[1:06:06] 32 below zero and they can't ever get
[1:06:10] themsel into a place where they rejoice
[1:06:12] IN THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR.
[1:06:15] BUT THE PROPHET SAID THIS IN THE SEVENTH
[1:06:18] SEAL THAT WHEN THE SUPERNATURAL COMES IN
[1:06:21] THAT IS THE MIND OF CHRIST. LET ME SAY
[1:06:24] THIS TO YOU. THIS CHURCH IS NOT
[1:06:26] PREGNANTATED WITH SOME DOGMA OR SOME
[1:06:28] HYBRID CREED. THIS CHURCH IS
[1:06:31] PREGNANTATED WITH THE SUPERNATURAL.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; Now look at your neighbor and say, "I'm
[1:06:36] pregnant."
[1:06:42] And y'all ain't getting used to this.
[1:06:45] That just feels funny. No, I know
[1:06:47] exactly what I'm talking about. I GOT
[1:06:51] SOMETHING THAT THE WORLD CAN'T HAVE AND
[1:06:54] THE WORLD DIDN'T GIVE ME. THE CHURCH
[1:06:56] DOWN THE ROAD DIDN'T GIVE ME THIS. SOME
[1:06:58] IDEA DIDN'T GIVE ME THIS. I RECEIVED
[1:07:01] SEED FROM THE HUSBAND.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; I'm pregnant.
[1:07:09] Maybe we should title it that I'm
[1:07:12] pregnant. That that ought to get us some
[1:07:15] clicks.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; You're not going to believe this. That
[1:07:20] pastor down there, Full Gospel
[1:07:21] Lighthouse, he is defying all odds.
[1:07:24] It'll be on Fox News and CNN tomorrow
[1:07:26] morning.
[1:07:28] MAN CLAIMS HE'S PREGNANT.
[1:07:31] WELL, I GOT SOMETHING THAT THE WORLD
[1:07:32] REALLY NEEDS.
[1:07:35] [applause]
[1:07:41] I want you TO KNOW THAT YOUR ENTIRE
[1:07:43] SUPERNATURAL OR YOUR SPIRITUAL birth is
[1:07:45] COMPLETELY SUPERNATURAL. IT'S A PARADOX
[1:07:48] THAT YOU'RE A VIRGIN.
[1:07:50] YOU'RE A VIRGIN. YOU KNOW THIS THAT GOD
[1:07:53] RETURNS YOU BACK TO YOUR INNOCENCY AND
[1:07:55] YOU'RE JUSTIFIED, BUT YOU'RE PREGNANT.
[1:07:58] YOU'RE A VIRGIN, BUT YOU'RE PREGNANT.
[1:08:01] YOU'VE BEEN WITH A HUSBAND, BUT YOU'RE A
[1:08:03] VIRGIN. YOUR MIND IS VIRGIN. YOUR SOUL
[1:08:06] IS VIRGIN. YOUR SPIRIT IS VIRGIN. YOU'VE
[1:08:09] NOT BEEN MANHANDLED. YOU'VE NOT BEEN MAN
[1:08:12] ABUSED. YOU HAVE BEEN A VIRGIN FROM THE
[1:08:15] MIND OF GOD. NO MAN DID YOU WRONG.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you young girls. You say,
[1:08:23] "Well, they this should be the daddy's
[1:08:25] job." Well, some of them don't have
[1:08:27] daddies. IF SOME MAN IS TRYING TO TAKE
[1:08:29] AWAY YOUR VIRGIN, RUN AWAY FROM THAT
[1:08:31] MAN.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; KEEP YOURSELF
[1:08:38] LET ME SAY THIS. IF SOME CHURCH IS
[1:08:40] TRYING TO TAKE AWAY YOUR VIRGIN, RUN.
[1:08:42] [screaming]
[1:08:44] THIS MESSAGE MAKES YOU VIRGIN.
[1:08:48] It makes you spotless.
[1:08:51] What was it when THE PROPHET WAS UP
[1:08:53] THERE IN THEM COLORADO MOUNTAINS? HE WAS
[1:08:56] UP THERE IN THEM VIRGIN TIMBERS AND HE
[1:08:59] SAW THE SUPERNATURAL COME DOWN. No man
[1:09:02] had ever touched it up there. And all of
[1:09:05] a sudden, Elohim capped it off with his
[1:09:07] life and said, "Would you like to WALK
[1:09:08] WITH ME?"
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HE WAS WALKING [screaming]
[1:09:12] IN A SPACE OF URGENCY. [panting]
[1:09:15] I say the son of man's still walking
[1:09:17] this hour. He's still walking through
[1:09:19] your life. And he's here to break the
[1:09:20] barrenness.
[1:09:23] IF YOU CAN'T BRING FORTH, THE SON OF MAN
[1:09:25] IS HERE TO BRING IT. IF YOU CANNOT
[1:09:27] MANIFEST, THE SON OF MAN IS HERE TO
[1:09:29] BREAK IT.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; [sighs]
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; I absolutely love this word
[1:09:41] because it causes us to look to the
[1:09:43] future by taking us back to God's
[1:09:46] promises and projecting our faith to a
[1:09:49] place
[1:09:51] projecting our faith to a place where we
[1:09:54] look to his promise because we realize
[1:09:57] that God has a certain intended space
[1:10:01] where his promise is going to be made
[1:10:02] manifest. Brother Mam said in Jehovah
[1:10:05] Gyra, he said one day when Abraham was
[1:10:07] sitting out there, he said the land was
[1:10:09] barren, he said sometimes we think that
[1:10:11] those things are curses. He said no. If
[1:10:15] you know your heart's right with God, no
[1:10:18] matter what happens, stay right with it.
[1:10:24] Ain't that a trick of the enemy?
[1:10:28] Just because things aren't going the way
[1:10:30] that you think they should and it looks
[1:10:33] like a stage of barrenness
[1:10:37] that the enemy like to make you think
[1:10:38] that's a curse. You've been cursed,
[1:10:41] sister. You got a curse over your life.
[1:10:44] If you was a real Christian, I've heard
[1:10:46] this. I've heard I've heard so-called
[1:10:49] message people, preachers sit there and
[1:10:52] say that to OUR SISTERS BECAUSE THEY'RE
[1:10:54] not able to bring forth children.
[1:10:55] There's a curse over their life.
[1:10:58] That is a false doctrine right from
[1:11:00] hell. THIS MESSAGE RESTORES YOU AND IT
[1:11:05] ROLLS AWAY YOUR REPROACH.
[1:11:09] JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE BARREN DOES NOT MEAN
[1:11:11] THAT YOU'RE CURSED. IT JUST MEANS YOU'RE
[1:11:13] IN A STAGE OF YOUR LIFE WHERE THE
[1:11:15] MANIFESTATION CAN BE SET UP FOR THE
[1:11:18] SUPERNATURAL.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; Let me say this. I don't care if you're
[1:11:23] 50 YEARS OLD.
[1:11:25] IF GOD SAID [screaming] OVER YOUR LIFE
[1:11:27] THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BRING FORTH, WELL,
[1:11:28] YOU SAY, "WELL, Brother Andrew, that's
[1:11:30] impossible." Talk to Sarah about it.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; Come on, TALK TO ABRAHAM ABOUT IT.
[1:11:37] ABRAHAM WASN'T CURSED. ABRAHAM WAS THE
[1:11:39] MOST BLESSED MAN THAT EVER WALKED IN
[1:11:42] SHOE LEATHER AT THAT TIME. BUT GOD HAD
[1:11:45] PUT A BLESSING OVER HIS LIFE.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; But the enemy sat there and laughed at
[1:11:50] him. Said, "Oh, you're going to be a
[1:11:51] father of nations, huh? Where's them
[1:11:53] children at?
[1:11:56] You know, there's a prophet that stood
[1:11:57] in this hour and there was a sister that
[1:12:00] stood in line. And the prophet told her,
[1:12:02] said, "Look," he told her in the prayer
[1:12:04] line that she was going to bring forth a
[1:12:06] healthy boy.
[1:12:08] And she got outside and got her hanging
[1:12:10] around the wrong churches. See, it's
[1:12:13] it's powerful who you make your friends
[1:12:15] and who you make your enemies. And she
[1:12:18] got to hang around with the wrong crowd.
[1:12:19] And they begin to talk about William
[1:12:21] Brandham. They said all kinds of
[1:12:22] different things AND SEWED DOUBT INTO
[1:12:25] HER mind and said instead OF SEWING
[1:12:28] SEEDS OF ACCURACY, they sowed seeds of
[1:12:30] doubt there and told her said these
[1:12:32] things will be and she got some awful
[1:12:34] disease and and many many years later
[1:12:37] her husband come back through the prayer
[1:12:38] line and met brother man through a
[1:12:40] circumstance and he was there and he
[1:12:43] told HER SAID MY MY WIFE IS IN THIS
[1:12:45] CONDITION THIS THIS LIES BEEN TOLD ABOUT
[1:12:47] YOU AND DIFFERENT THINGS. He said, "IT
[1:12:49] WAS THUS SAYAITH THE LORD she was going
[1:12:50] to have that baby, wasn't it?" He said,
[1:12:52] "THEN TELL HER THAT SHE'S GOING TO BRING
[1:12:55] forth a son. It wasn't no more than 12
[1:12:58] months later she had a 8 POUND BABY BOY
[1:13:00] AT SOME 50SOME YEAR OLD AGE."
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; WELL, God must still be God then.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; I love what brother Brandham said.
[1:13:15] [sighs] How about in Jehovah Gyra? He
[1:13:18] said, "She was barren, but Abraham was
[1:13:21] sterile."
[1:13:24] So God didn't just work on Sarah. He had
[1:13:27] to work on Abraham.
[1:13:32] I think I I'd like to just draw your
[1:13:34] attention right here. Is that Abraham's
[1:13:37] 75 and she's 65.
[1:13:41] at the time of the promise in Genesis
[1:13:43] 12. You look at those things
[1:13:47] [snorts]
[1:13:49] and I I'd like to tie that to many of
[1:13:52] our Christian walk is that Abraham tried
[1:13:55] on his own for 25 years.
[1:13:58] He tried on his own for 25 years.
[1:14:02] But barrenness will bring you to a spot
[1:14:04] where you realize that you've got to be
[1:14:06] fully dependent on the Almighty.
[1:14:10] Well, you can tie that right to Hagar
[1:14:13] and typing it to the new birth.
[1:14:15] Is that you will try to produce
[1:14:17] something in your own Christian walk to
[1:14:20] bring forth the message of the hour
[1:14:23] and you'll try to work it up. You'll go
[1:14:26] to the altar. You'll pray. You'll cry.
[1:14:29] You'll boohoo. and he'll sit there in a
[1:14:31] spot of sanctification and never go all
[1:14:34] the way. And just because you brought
[1:14:36] forth an Ishmamail does not mean that
[1:14:39] you have felt you have fallen through in
[1:14:42] the promises of God that everything's
[1:14:43] going correct. Let me say this to you.
[1:14:46] You can never go all the way in the
[1:14:48] rapture by just producing an Israel.
[1:14:51] You've got to go all the way. And you
[1:14:54] can try to do this on your own. You can
[1:14:56] try to figure this out on your own. You
[1:14:58] can try TO WORK IT OUT and read all the
[1:15:00] help self-help books all that you want
[1:15:02] to. You can read THROUGH EVERY IDEOLOGY
[1:15:05] OUT THERE. YOU CAN LOOK AT EVERY
[1:15:07] SCRIPTURE AND YOU CAN STUDY IT IN SUCH A
[1:15:09] way where you feel like you are
[1:15:11] acquainted WITH THE ALMIGHTY. YOU CAN
[1:15:13] GET TO A SPOT WHERE YOU FEEL
[1:15:15] self-sufficient
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; and you're not going to make it. Let me
[1:15:20] say this to you. IF YOU'RE IN THAT TYPE
[1:15:21] OF CONDITION, PREPARE FOR THE
[1:15:23] TRIBULATION, [snorts]
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; where you think you're okay,
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; where you think you CAN DO IT ON YOUR
[1:15:31] OWN,
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO GO FURTHER. YOU CAN'T DO THIS
[1:15:37] ON YOUR OWN. YOU CAN NEVER BRING FORTH
[1:15:40] AN ISAAC ON YOUR OWN. YOU CAN NEVER GET
[1:15:43] THE HOLY GHOST ON YOUR OWN.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT [screaming] TO DIE. ABRAHAM,
[1:15:49] YOU'VE DONE THIS ALL ALONE ON YOUR OWN.
[1:15:52] IT'S TIME THAT YOU HAVE A MEETING WITH
[1:15:55] THIS MELZDC.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; ABRAHAM TRIED FOR 25 YEARS, BUT ONE
[1:16:00] MOMENT, ONE MOMENT, BROTHER ISAAC, IN
[1:16:03] THE PRESENCE OF MELCHAZDC, IT CHANGED
[1:16:06] HIM FOREVER.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; How powerful was this change that when
[1:16:12] Sarah died, Abraham had seven more
[1:16:14] children.
[1:16:16] HE DID SOMETHING TO ABRAHAM.
[1:16:20] Maybe lock the doors.
[1:16:22] SOMETHING HAD CHANGED.
[1:16:25] SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED TO ABRAHAM. HE
[1:16:27] HAD been changed.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; You know good and well. Well, let me go
[1:16:34] on. Somebody's trying to lock a door on
[1:16:37] me.
[1:16:39] You could not break the spirit of
[1:16:43] barness on your own.
[1:16:48] You see
[1:16:50] why Satan
[1:16:54] hates our mother so much.
[1:16:57] It's because he fears
[1:17:00] what that seed will become.
[1:17:03] You see, to many of people, Joseph was
[1:17:06] just a teenager that was full of dreams.
[1:17:10] But in God's supernatural mind, he had
[1:17:13] already already saw him
[1:17:16] already saw him as a ruler
[1:17:19] over Israel.
[1:17:21] Now notice what the prophet said in a
[1:17:23] smirking church age. I'm jumping down
[1:17:24] brothers and sisters. He said in Exodus
[1:17:27] 13 and 13, he said, "Every first of an
[1:17:30] ass thou shalt redeem and when and with
[1:17:33] a lamb thou will not redeem it." Every
[1:17:36] first of an ass thou shalt redeem with a
[1:17:38] lamb. And if thou wil not redeem it,
[1:17:40] then thou shalt break his neck, and all
[1:17:42] the firstborn among man, thy children
[1:17:44] shalt thou redeemed. He said, see the
[1:17:46] ass can be redeemed. Every miserable
[1:17:48] sinner can be redeemed by the blood
[1:17:50] sacrifice of Jesus Christ or in
[1:17:53] rejecting Christ be rejected himself.
[1:17:56] But you don't redeem the mule. There is
[1:17:58] no redemption for him. There is no blood
[1:18:01] for him. There can't be. Because the
[1:18:03] mule takes refuge in the church while
[1:18:05] the ass takes refuge in the blood. The
[1:18:08] mule has NO SEED IN HIM THAT CAN BE
[1:18:10] QUICKENED, BUT THE ASS has seat. So what
[1:18:14] you're carrying
[1:18:16] puts YOU IN POSITION FOR A MIRACLE. IT
[1:18:19] PUTS YOU IN A MESSAGE OR A PLACE OF
[1:18:21] POSITION TO BE RESTORED OR TO BE MADE
[1:18:24] ALIVE.
[1:18:28] When you look at where we just where we
[1:18:30] draw this whole thought on breaking
[1:18:32] barness back in Judges chapter 13, you
[1:18:36] go to looking at that and I I I really
[1:18:39] studied that from a different different
[1:18:40] angle than I've ever looked at it before
[1:18:43] is that when God begins to open up that
[1:18:45] scripture in Judges 13. you look at it
[1:18:48] is that God does not introduce He does
[1:18:51] not introduce the chapter as Samson the
[1:18:54] great hero that is a hero that is
[1:18:57] waiting but he introduces that chapter
[1:18:59] as a God who God God as a God who moves
[1:19:04] his children INTO IMPOSSIBLE PLACES AND
[1:19:07] BRINGS THEM TO A place where they
[1:19:09] remember what they were built for. You
[1:19:12] see, there was a condition on Monoah's
[1:19:14] wife and she was BARREN FROM THIS SPOT.
[1:19:18] AND GOD LOOKED AT THAT CONDITION BEFORE
[1:19:21] HE EVER SPOKE ABOUT the deliverer. You
[1:19:24] look at Judges 13, you will see that IT
[1:19:27] WAS IN A TIME of the church of the
[1:19:29] judges, like the church ages, where
[1:19:31] every man just did what was right in his
[1:19:33] own sight. And there they were in a spot
[1:19:36] of barrenness. The entry point INTO
[1:19:38] [clears throat] JUDGES 13 WAS THAT THERE
[1:19:41] WAS A POLITICAL BARRENNESS, there was a
[1:19:43] SPIRITUAL BARRENNESS, AND THERE WAS A
[1:19:45] physical barrenness of Monoah's wife.
[1:19:47] BUT I WANT YOU TO NOTICE THIS, THAT ONE
[1:19:50] VISITATION addressed all three OF THE
[1:19:53] BARREN TYPES THAT was in that church.
[1:19:56] AND WHEN THEY GOT TO THIS POSITION, THEY
[1:19:59] RECOGNIZED THEY COULD NOT TAKE CREDIT
[1:20:02] for bringing FORTH SAMSON. THEY COULD
[1:20:04] NOT BRING FORTH THE CREDIT TO SAY THAT
[1:20:06] THEY WERE GREATER THAN THE PHILISTINE
[1:20:08] ARMY. THEY COULD NOT EXPLAIN THE OUTCOME
[1:20:11] THAT WAS GETTING READY TO COME. BUT GOD
[1:20:14] BROKE THE barrenness
[1:20:17] by bringing forth seed.
[1:20:21] So it means that only life can come from
[1:20:25] God.
[1:20:27] Let me say this.
[1:20:29] You're not forgotten. Amen.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; You're in position.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; And I I I really hope that you hear me
[1:20:38] tonight. There's got to be a turning
[1:20:41] point.
[1:20:43] Whether it's in your mind or you start
[1:20:46] speaking it until you believe it.
[1:20:49] There's got to be a turning point.
[1:20:51] There's got to be a spot in your life
[1:20:53] where you look and you act upon the
[1:20:55] word.
[1:20:58] and had come to that position.
[1:21:01] They couldn't do this on earth.
[1:21:05] You face them sane Philistines because
[1:21:07] spirits never die.
[1:21:10] They want to steal, to kill, and
[1:21:13] destroy.
[1:21:15] Tomorrow, I'm going to dig into those
[1:21:16] those four bugs just a little bit. But I
[1:21:20] want you to know that before you can
[1:21:21] ever get to a place where you break
[1:21:26] barrenness,
[1:21:27] you got to get the atmosphere just
[1:21:29] right.
[1:21:33] That everything's got to be just right.
[1:21:35] It's got to be the right time. It's got
[1:21:38] to be with fertile seed. It's got to be
[1:21:41] in a place where God can manifest his
[1:21:44] glory.
[1:21:47] So, you've got to come. Let me say it to
[1:21:49] you like this. You got to come to church
[1:21:51] expected.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; You got to have a prayer life at home.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; You got to be in a position where the
[1:21:58] message is not foreign to you. But you
[1:22:00] understand,
[1:22:02] you understand what is getting ready to
[1:22:04] take place. You set the atmosphere. And
[1:22:08] when you set the atmosphere, that's
[1:22:10] where the supernatural can take place.
[1:22:14] Anybody that's a farmer knows that it
[1:22:16] takes the right kind of an atmosphere to
[1:22:18] bring forth the right kind of a crop. It
[1:22:21] takes good ground. It takes good
[1:22:23] sunlight. It takes moisture. It takes
[1:22:25] all of these conditions. And I want you
[1:22:27] to know the best condition to get
[1:22:29] yourself to break barrenness is
[1:22:31] repentance.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; Is repentance. It's the zeal of this
[1:22:38] hour, young people. If you want to break
[1:22:42] the baroness where you constantly are, I
[1:22:45] I I'm living right. I'm doing right. I I
[1:22:47] I feel like I feel like I'm really
[1:22:49] having a breakthrough. I I I really felt
[1:22:50] the Holy Ghost move. If you really want
[1:22:52] to break that where you're constantly on
[1:22:55] up and down, just repent.
[1:22:58] I know that's real, real simple, but I
[1:23:02] want you to notice notice this. I never
[1:23:05] went to no schooling to figure out how
[1:23:07] to be a preacher. I never went to school
[1:23:08] into how to figure out how to be a
[1:23:10] Christian. I never went to school in how
[1:23:11] to learn how to study the message. I
[1:23:14] never went to those schools. But I tell
[1:23:16] you what I did do.
[1:23:19] I got myself in position.
[1:23:22] Your position might be in this church.
[1:23:25] Your position might be in your car. Your
[1:23:26] position might be right here at this
[1:23:28] altar.
[1:23:30] And if you want to be in position for a
[1:23:32] miracle, then repent.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; Because I can tell you this. I was
[1:23:37] barren and I was dry and I was weary and
[1:23:40] I was wore out. But when I begin to
[1:23:43] repent,
[1:23:45] something broke over my life. What was
[1:23:50] it? I WAS HARD AS ALL GET OUT. And
[1:23:54] there's many times where people go
[1:23:56] through that spot of sanctification and
[1:23:58] they're hard and they just let the word
[1:24:00] roll over them and it doesn't do
[1:24:02] anything to them. and they'll go through
[1:24:04] a stage of their Christian walk. And I
[1:24:07] know I'm speaking to somebody right now,
[1:24:08] but I I just want to make this uh broad.
[1:24:11] So, I'm not so I'm not just a uh
[1:24:14] speaking to one individual, but you go
[1:24:16] through those spots. You go through
[1:24:18] those spots where you feel like you're
[1:24:20] all alone and you feel like you're you
[1:24:22] you can't make it on your own and you
[1:24:24] then you get you get yourself you get
[1:24:26] your head above water just enough where
[1:24:27] you can breathe again. And before long,
[1:24:30] Satan comes along again and he dunks you
[1:24:31] back under and you you feel that
[1:24:34] pressure to get back up. There's
[1:24:36] something there that you're trying to
[1:24:38] get out of. But what is it? You still
[1:24:41] got some fight on the inside of you. And
[1:24:43] if you got some fight to get above the
[1:24:45] waters where Satan's trying to drown you
[1:24:47] with that shows there's SOMETHING
[1:24:49] VALUABLE ON THE INSIDE OF YOU, JUST
[1:24:51] FIGHT TO GET YOUR HEAD BACK UP. GET BACK
[1:24:54] TO THAT SPOT. AND WHEN YOU GET BACK UP
[1:24:56] THERE, LET THE LIFE OF THE HOLY GHOST
[1:24:59] BREAK OVER YOU.
[1:25:03] [sighs]
[1:25:05] So get yourself
[1:25:08] in position
[1:25:10] for the miracle.
[1:25:12] Abraham and Sarah got themselves in
[1:25:14] position.
[1:25:17] Monoah and his wife got themsel in
[1:25:20] position by taking the angel's words.
[1:25:22] The widow of Zerapath got herself in
[1:25:25] position by simply acting upon the word
[1:25:27] OF GOD. JONAH GOT HIMSELF in position by
[1:25:30] accepting the word that told him that if
[1:25:33] he would turn his face towards THAT
[1:25:36] TEMPLE THAT GOD would hear his prayer.
[1:25:38] HALLELUJAH. PETER GOT HIMSELF IN
[1:25:40] POSITION BY CASTING HIS NETS ON THE
[1:25:43] OTHER SIDE. IT WAS NOT HIS PHYSICAL
[1:25:45] STRENGTH THAT PUT THE FISH IN THE BOAT.
[1:25:48] IT WAS HIM PUTTING HIMSELF IN OBEDIENCE
[1:25:51] IN POSITION FOR THE MIRACLE TO TAKE
[1:25:53] PLACE.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; When you put yourself in position,
[1:26:00] then you can watch barness break.
[1:26:06] I'd say it's it's time we start hearing
[1:26:09] some cries.
[1:26:13] And I I'm finished and the musicians can
[1:26:15] make their way.
[1:26:17] It's time that we hear some cries of
[1:26:19] some children.
[1:26:22] Too many times,
[1:26:25] too many times we set in a position
[1:26:30] of satisfaction.
[1:26:34] But let me say this to you. If you've
[1:26:36] ever been in a birthing room,
[1:26:38] there's a lot of noise in there.
[1:26:42] There's a lot of emotion there.
[1:26:45] There's a lot of heightened intensity
[1:26:48] moments there. And in that space,
[1:26:54] it's a place of birth.
[1:26:57] It's a place of it's a real holy place
[1:27:00] if we could say it like that.
[1:27:05] There's times
[1:27:07] there's tears of sorrow.
[1:27:12] And I believe that too many times that
[1:27:13] we've got parents that have cried the
[1:27:16] tears of sorrow because they've not seen
[1:27:18] their children manifest the life that
[1:27:20] they wanted them to.
[1:27:24] Don't you give up.
[1:27:26] Don't you give up. You keep holding on.
[1:27:31] But I want to say this to you. It's time
[1:27:32] that we have some tears of joy.
[1:27:36] It's time that we have some rejoicing
[1:27:40] in this church and in your life.
[1:27:43] I said this one time and it really
[1:27:45] stuck. Sometime in your life, you need a
[1:27:48] W. You need a win. You get to a spot
[1:27:51] where you really just need to have a a
[1:27:53] moment of victory.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; You ever been there?
[1:27:57] You need a season of victory.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; Can I prophesy to you?
[1:28:02] YOU'RE GETTING READY TO HAVE A season of
[1:28:04] victory, bride.
[1:28:09] [applause]
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; You go through seasons OF REJECTION, OF
[1:28:17] SORROW AND FEAR. IT'S TIME TO GO THROUGH
[1:28:21] THE THE SEASON OF WEEPING. WHERE HAS OUR
[1:28:24] WEEPING HAS BEEN TURNED TO JOY AND OUR
[1:28:26] OUR SORROW AND OUR OUR BARRENNESS AND
[1:28:28] OUR ASHES BECOME BEAUTY? WHERE
[1:28:30] EVERYTHING THAT WE'VE STRUGGLED THROUGH,
[1:28:33] FINALLY WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY
[1:28:36] TO REJOICE TO MANIFEST THE PRAISES OF
[1:28:40] GOD BACK UPON OUR LIPS AGAIN.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; SO, if we're going to bring forth, then
[1:28:49] there's got to be some crying. I I I
[1:28:52] always I enjoy it, but it scares me too
[1:28:56] sitting around mothers that talk about
[1:28:57] their birthing experiences.
[1:29:00] scares scares me to death what I'm going
[1:29:02] to hear and I then there's always
[1:29:05] competition
[1:29:08] that nobody had as bad birthing process
[1:29:10] as I had. I'm telling you I had to have
[1:29:13] 14 epidurals and that that needle my
[1:29:16] husband passed out. He was eating a
[1:29:17] Snickers and my husband just wasn't in
[1:29:19] the right mood. He said the wrong thing.
[1:29:21] He told me to breathe and I told him to
[1:29:23] shut up.
[1:29:26] But everybody's got their different
[1:29:27] birthing stories. But who cares as long
[1:29:31] as you have a birth?
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; I don't care whether it happens here at
[1:29:36] FULL GOSPEL LIGHTHOUSE OR IF IT HAPPENS
[1:29:38] TO YOU WHILE YOU'RE AT WORK. I DON'T
[1:29:40] CARE IF YOU HAD TO GO THROUGH THROUGH
[1:29:41] LABOR FOR 14 HOURS OR 22 HOURS. AS LONG
[1:29:45] AS YOU HAD SOME BIRTH,
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; BUT IF THAT BABY'S STILL LOCKED up on
[1:29:51] the inside OF YOU, THEN YOU'VE got
[1:29:52] yourself an issue
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; and you got to have a C-section. BUT I
[1:29:57] WANT YOU TO KNOW THERE'S A DOCTOR HERE
[1:29:59] THAT KNOWS HOW TO BRING FORTH CHILDREN.
[1:30:01] AND IT MAY NOT IT MAY LOOK LIKE THEY'RE
[1:30:03] NEVER COMING, THAT THEY'RE NEVER GOING
[1:30:06] TO COME FORTH. BUT I SAY THIS TO YOU,
[1:30:08] THERE'S A DOCTOR IN THIS ROOM THAT KNOWS
[1:30:11] HOW TO HEAL, THAT KNOWS HOW TO BREAK
[1:30:14] BARRENNESS, THAT knows [applause] the
[1:30:16] atmosphere.
[1:30:18] God bless you, brother Matthew. Let's
[1:30:20] stand.
[1:30:24] But I searched the world.
[1:30:28] [music]
[1:30:28] Oh, but [singing] it couldn't feel me.
[1:30:33] [music]
[1:30:34] Man's empty praise and treasures that
[1:30:39] they are never enough. [music]
[1:30:45] Oh, then you came along. [music]
[1:30:50] Oh man, put me back together.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; And every desire [music]
[1:30:59] is now [singing] satisfied
[1:31:02] hearing your [music] love.
[1:31:08] Oh, there's [music] nothing
[1:31:12] better than you, Lord.
[1:31:14] [music and singing] There's nothing
[1:31:18] better than [music] you, Lord. There's
[1:31:20] [singing] nothing
[1:31:23] nothing is [music] better than you.
[1:31:27] There's nothing
[1:31:30] Oh, there's [music and singing] nothing
[1:31:34] better than you. [music]
[1:31:36] Oh, there's [singing] nothing
[1:31:40] better [music] than you, Lord. There's
[1:31:42] [singing] nothing,
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; nothing is better [music] than
[1:31:52] the life [music] of God
[1:31:58] to surely [music] my
[1:32:04] failures.
[1:32:06] [music]
[1:32:07] Oh, you see
[1:32:09] you still
[1:32:16] [music]
[1:32:22] have [singing]
[1:32:26] there's not [music] a drink. Your mercy
[1:32:30] and grace walk by me again. [music]
[1:32:37] Oh, there's nothing
[1:32:41] better [music] than you, Lord. There's
[1:32:44] [singing] nothing
[1:32:47] better than you, Lord.
[1:32:49] [music and singing] There's nothing
[1:32:53] nothing
[1:32:54] better than you.
[1:33:00] Oh, there's nothing [music]
[1:33:04] better than me, Lord. There's
[1:33:07] [music and singing] nothing
[1:33:10] better than you, Lord. [music] There's
[1:33:13] nothing,
[1:33:15] nothing [singing] is better than you.
[1:33:24] You turn [music and singing] morning to
[1:33:27] dancing.
[1:33:30] You [music and singing] give beauty for
[1:33:33] a shame.
[1:33:36] You turn [music] shame into glory.
[1:33:40] You're the only [music] one who cares.
[1:33:47] You [music] turn morning to dancing.
[1:33:53] [music] You give beauty for a shame.
[1:33:59] You turn shame [music and singing] into
[1:34:01] glory.
[1:34:03] You're the only one who gave. [music]
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; You turn [music] gra into gardenings.
[1:34:19] You turn bones into [singing]
[1:34:21] aries.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; You turn seas into highways. [singing]
[1:34:29] You're the only one who [music]
[1:34:37] Oh, there's [music and singing] nothing
[1:34:42] better than [music] you, Lord. There's
[1:34:44] [singing] nothing
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; that's better than you, Lord. There's
[1:34:50] [music] nothing
[1:34:54] Nothing is better than you. Oh, there's
[1:34:58] nothing.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, [music and singing] there's nothing
[1:35:05] better than you, Lord. There's [music]
[1:35:08] nothing
[1:35:11] that's better than you, [music]
[1:35:14] there's nothing,
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; nothing is better than you.
[1:35:25] Christ
[1:35:31] alone
[1:35:32] will [music] glory.
[1:35:36] I could pride myself in [music] that
[1:35:40] one.
[1:35:45] I've been blessed [music]
[1:35:47] beyond measure
[1:35:50] and lovely by your strength. I overcome.
[1:36:03] I could stop [music] and cast successes
[1:36:08] like diamonds [music]
[1:36:10] in
[1:36:14] [music]
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; but those glories were not [singing]
[1:36:21] to the praise
[1:36:24] I reach [music and singing]
[1:36:30] and Christ Oh
[1:36:34] [music] my place, my [singing]
[1:36:37] trust
[1:36:40] and find [music and singing] my glory.
[1:36:44] The power of [music]
[1:36:51] every [singing]
[1:36:54] [music]
[1:37:00] mess.
[1:37:03] [music]
[1:37:07] My soul [singing]
[1:37:10] [music]
[1:37:12] is Christ the Lord.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; Christ alone [music]
[1:37:20] will I [singing] glory.
[1:37:23] Though only by [music]
[1:37:26] his grace I [singing] am redeemed.
[1:37:32] And only [music]
[1:37:34] his
[1:37:36] mercies
[1:37:39] can reach beyond [music]
[1:37:41] my weakness
[1:37:43] to my
[1:37:50] [music]
[1:37:53] no
[1:37:57] just to [music] know you.

[1:38:34] The power of God
[1:38:45] [music]
