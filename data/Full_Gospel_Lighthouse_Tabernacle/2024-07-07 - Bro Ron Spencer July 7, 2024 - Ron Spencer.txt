was born and was hid 3 months of his parents because they saw that he was a proper child and they were not afraid of the king's commandment by faith Moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter powerful statement next choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season I want to read that scripture with you together because you have done the same thing that's right choosing rather to suffer Affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season then goes further

July well brother Ron that was ped but that's what I'm preaching on today amen we celebrated the 4th of July here in America and for those that are listening by the way and many other countries they don't understand what we're saying but that is our independence day that we celebrate and independence from from other countries especially with great oppression for their tax purposes and for their holding control over our nation it was a great thing for our nation to find their freedom but Freedom comes with a great cost many lives were lost because of the cost and there's a lot of stories that goes with it and men like Paul rever that would make a long R ride one night and begin to scream to a nation a Young Nation screaming the British are coming the British are coming it is Untold of how many lives would die within the few days because we were wanting our freedom and we were willing to stand up for it you know a lot of people want freedom but they're not willing to stand up for it a lot of people gave their lives to continue to have freedom we have great great cemeteries that are dedicated to our War veterans and great great memorials that are there and names that are written on it let me just say this to you don't never take that for granted don't never take that for granted brother Ron but you shouldn't bring politics in it well let me just say this to you if you want to burn our flag if you want to hate our nation if you want to if you want to do bad things to our country move leave leave amen this is one of the greatest Nations on the world and and I still stand for her yes we're from another country but we are a nation Americans and I'm proud to be an American you want to quote brother brandom said I stand with her in her glory and I stand with her inner shame across across uh sister Joyce Sister Evelyn there maybe last night I saw them there there live real clur to a place called C pepper and in C pepper there was a preacher that was there that that that was a man that did not want to be under the oppress oppression of the original uh church and and so the church was trying to force him to preach a certain thing but he wanted to preach the word of God and stand in Freedom and it came with cost they they put him in stocks and he would be there until he died but he didn't just stand there and say poor old me poor old me poor old me he stood there and preached with his arms in stalks in his head and his neck in stalks and he preached a sermon called Give me liberty or give me death amen there was a man that rode past and he was on a horse this man so happened to be Patrick Henry Patrick Henry stopped and listened to this man preach and it so moved Patrick Henry he couldn't free this man but it so moved him until he went back to the halls of the men that he was serving with in the young government he stood to his feet and he gave the resounding statement that that preacher had said yes amen and he gave the speech of why should we be under the shackles of England and all of Great Britain and all the people that are trying to force us to be a certain way and he and he came to the conclusion Give me liberty Give me liberty or give me death now let let me to say it caused a movement within our young government and these were men that were sitting with him and I don't know if you've you've kind of given this thought but when they write the Declaration of Independence it's going to come with a cost it's going to come with a cost when you identify with a certain thing it comes with a cost I'm going to get to you in just a little bit just be patient with me these 56 men were proud to put their names on this document of a Young Nation that would declare their independence their freedom maybe you've never thought about it but maybe you've wondered what happened to these 56 men well let me just take a minute to to just just share with you five of the S siners were captured by the British as Traders and tortured before they died 12 had their homes rans Saed and burned two lost their sons in the Revolutionary War another had Sons captured nine of the 56 fought and died from wounds and hardships of the revolution Ary War they signed and pledged their lives their Tor their fortunes and their their sacred honor what kind of a men were they 24 of them were lawyers jurist 11 were Merchants nine were farmers and large plantation owners men of means well educated but they signed the Declaration of Independence fully knowing well that that the plent of the penalty but would be death if they were captured Carter Braxton of Virginia a wealthy planter and Trader saw his ship swept away from the Seas by the British Navy he sold his home and his properties to pay his debt and he died in rags Thomas Thomas McKing was hounded by the British that forced him to move from his family almost consciously he served in the Congress without pay his family was kept in hiding his possessions were taken away from him and poverty was his reward vandals and soldiers of both looted properties of of Ellery and Clore and Hall and Walton and gwenan and and Haywood and rutage and Middleton at the Battle of Yorktown Thomas Nelson noted that the British general Cornwall Wallace had taken Nelson's home for his headquarters and the owner owner quietly urged General George Washington open fire on my home the home was destroyed and Nelson died in complete bankruptcy Francis Lewis had his home and property destroyed the enemy jailed his wife and she died within a few months John Hart was driven from his home his wife's bedside as she was dying their 13 children fled for their lives his field and his grindstone were laid to waste for more than a year he lived in forest and Cays returning home to find his wife dead and his children vanished a few weeks later he died from exhaustion with a broken heart Norris and Livingston suffered the same kind of Fate all of these are stories of the 56 men who were willing to sign their name to the dec clation of Independence there was one man that we all know his name is John Hancock he's famous because his name is the largest but John Hancock had a reason to sign his name that large he said I want to sign my name so large until the king will not have to put his reading glasses on to see my name go ahead and give them a great big hand right now we live in such a day of Pumped and Splendor and plastic until people don't feel the cost to be an American we've got it really good right now it ain't going to be that way much longer because the prophet told us that way but not only that God sent us a message that has came with great cost to it I'd like to share some of those things with us this morning by faith Moses by faith Moses chose the Affliction that's of the people of God rather than to be the next Pharaoh in line and live in plush this is quite a choice this is quite a choice we should never complain we should never listen we don't have a right to complain he forsook Egypt there will be a lot of things that you'll have to forsake in your life but it'll be worth it [Music] [Applause] all Paul would write it in verse 33 of the same chapter of chapter 11 and talk about some of our Runners that would have to make choices who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouths of lions quench the violence of fire escape the edge of the sword out of weaknesses were made strong wax Valiant in Flight fight turn to flight the armies of the adens women receed their dead raised to life again others were tortured not accepting Deliverance but they that they might obtain a better resurrection and others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings yay moreover abondon imprisonment they were stoned they were swn aunder were tempted were slain with a sword they wondered about in sheep skins and goat skins being destitute Afflicted and tormented right of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in dens and in mountains and in dens and caves of the earth and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise it didn't say that they lived a plush life it didn't say that they lived in castles with Kings and princes they lived with caves they lived in mountains they lived right but they refuse to give up I love the scripture of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and dens and caves of the earth and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise God having provided some better thing for us let's read this all together it's too good God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be perfect there are waiting on us they can't finish the Redemption report until we make it hallelujah hallelujah Hebrews 12 and verse 1 wherefore seeing we are also compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses oh I love this scripture this scripture set me on fire many years ago let us let us let us lay aside every weight right let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us George Washington was persistent this is in perseverance George Washington was pers persistent at Valley Forge all the odds was against him the enemy was across the river but after all night in prayer and the American soldiers with no shoes on their feet about onethird of them had shoes and they crossed a river at Valley Forge through the ice and three musket bullets went through his coat but he had an answer from God and there was no need of of him backing down nothing could stop him then I say this you nothing can stop us now we have an answer from [Applause] God may this be our testimony he crossed it because he was persistent he had hurt from God and that's the way we've got to be if God says so that settles it in job chap 13 and verse 13 hold your peace let me alone that I may speak and let come on me what will wherefore do I take my flesh and in my teeth and put my life in my hand though he slay me though he slay me yet will I trust him but I will maintain my ways before him when God told me on December the 22nd if you trust me I'll use you like never before maybe in some of my thoughts I thought it would be glorious and some of the things that would be in my way I've been around the world preaching I've stood in some Precious Places some absolutely awesome places I've stood in some of the greatest conventions of the message I did not know in a couple of weeks cancer would be my news and I would still be here fighting it four years later but I trust that you have never seen me Sher my responsibility I trust that you have never seen me so weak in my flesh until I was willing to give up if we've got a fight let us fight every one of us are going to pay a cost every one of your testimonies are different how you got here how you have had to stand how you have come maybe with the clothes on your back but you came regardless cost all goes all the way back to Abraham he is buying a b a burial place for Sarah and he goes to his he goes to the people in the community it's a special spot that he wants to bury he wants to bury her in a special spot she was the love of his life she was the one that got changed back to young again she was his childhood sweetheart she was the one that held a testimony with him no doubt she had doubted for years and doubted for years but she had heard him give the testimony even 25 years we're going to have a son and even having a son now that son grows up and she would have to allow Abraham to trust God when God tells him the the greatest trial that he ever have offer thy son thy only son he had trusted God to have him but now he has to trust God if he takes his life God will raise him back up again that's right sometimes God ask us for the ultimate brother Ron but I want peace and prosperity you showed up at the wrong place Place brother Ron I want everything to be good wrong war wrong war and he tells these men I want to buy this piece of property I want to buy Mella listen they didn't know what the significance of of him burying her there because it's in that property where there's going to come a resurrection amen he didn't want to just bury her in any church he just didn't want to bury her on any piece of property he wants to bury her where Jesus Christ is going to come alive listen don't bury me in some denomination don't you bury me in some denomination you bury me where he's going to raise up again Joseph said you you bury my bones down here Jacob said don't you bury my bones down here you carry my bones home carry them back to where Abraham said bury us and Abraham said oh no oh no I don't want I want you to give me the property cuz there'll always be a little something that you'll come back on me on now here's the pivotal part here comes the theme now don't you give it to me I'm willing to pay the price for it and they said bury your dad bury your dad bury your dead hey we're friends here bury your dead we'll give it to you no sir no sir they ask him the ultimate price Inc magazine which is Inc magazine a Incorporated magazine says until today this is the highest piece of property ever sold think about that the celebrities sell their property for millions and millions and millions of dollars for an acre and a half house but this piece of a property is the highest piece of property that has ever been exchanged amen Abraham was a man of means I want you to always remember this God's a big God God is an unlimited God God is your provider God is your provider and if God is your partner you better have big [Applause] [Music] plans I want you to get it don't you you you don't have to go around and confess oh pity me if God is your god and you believe him to be your God he will supply you may not know where it's going to come from you may not have any realization of where it's going to come but God is your [Applause] partner Abraham paid the ultimate cost he paid for the property and he got the papers he got the title deed to the papers to where it was searched all the way back and no devil could come up to him and tell them you owe this or you owe this or you owe [Music] this you just watch deep call to the Deep it's in that time frame it's probably in that same week brother brandham sat with dignitaries he actually sat with great politicians one of the speakers is Richard Nixon and he literally sets from me to Isaiah and sets an intently he's listening to him brother Brenham sat with great men it's in that in that Hall that they begin to talk about communism they begin to talk about romanism and they begin to talk about the curtains and brother and they're talking about America falling remember what brother brandom said he said said it's not them he said it's the rottenness Among Us that's what's destroyed this nation sin destroys All Nations and we have committed the ultimate sin and turned our back on God that's right you put God out of your schools you put God out of your government you tell him he's not welcome there he'll leave you I want to say kabot will happen to your church it'll happen to your government and God will leave you if he's not welcome let me go further than governments in your he'll leave your home I'm going to preach to you I'm going to preach to you you always make God welcome at your home it's a home where you pray and you read your Bible before your children somebody ought to help me preach somebody ought to be helping me preach here this morning listen God don't want to just be in church he wants to be in your [Applause] home critical spirits and evil spirits will drive him out and then you wonder what's happened to you Revival don't start in in a church it starts in your home it starts in your life am our Prophet that sat there and listened to Richard Nixon speak a lot of dignitaries was around him because they he was popular this is before they turned down the message they didn't want him after the message came denomination didn't want him after the message came but if you remember before they turned the message down they offered brother brandom millions of dollars now we can imagine what a million dollars is today I don't know how many millionaires I'm preaching to you right now but a million dollars in the late 50s and the early 60s is a lot of money there a lot of money and it'll change your life a million dollars will change your life you know there's some people not willing to pay the cost that's right as long as everything is going good but they're not willing to pay the cost there's a lot of people that are willing to you know if they were the pastor they would do certain thing and they would do certain thing and this is they would do certain things you know if I was brother Ron I'd do certain things and they make up a lot of Minds just kind of like a Monday Morning Quarterback but they're not willing to pay the cost they're not willing they're not willing to set up and say [Applause] amen hallelujah not willing to put it in listen I didn't get nothing out of church what did you put in come on when it come your time to amen and when you come your time to Worship the Lord when it came your time this is your time let me let me just be really honest with you this is your your opportunity you know you you're not called to be a preacher and it takes weeks to put a sermon together and and you're not willing to put your effort I'm not just talking here I'm talking other places too to be alert and identify yourself how many men stood there in the room that refused to sign am on the day of Pentecost when 120 was said I'll go to The Upper Room 380 people was refused 380 people refus to pay the cost oh yeah we don't know nothing about their life when they lived and they died it was over let me just preach I feel I feel him here so I'm going to preach to you the millionaires in the days of Moody we don't hear nothing about them the Millionaires and they were the millionaires with John Wesley we don't hear nothing about them the millionaires on Aza Street we don't hear nothing about them the millionaires that said in brother brandom's meeting we don't know nothing about them but the despised few that said I'll go all the way I'm willing I'm willing I'm willing to go all the way I'm going to make a bold statement here if you're not willing you're dismissed don't waste your time here this is the wrong place for you to be you're dismissed I'll quit paying my ties don't worry God will raise somebody [Applause] up and beside I Don't Preach for money I preach for the drive that is on the inside of me the drive that I've got greater than cancer the drive that I've got is greater than my trouble the drive that I've got is willing to go all the way [Applause] let's just lay it on the line yeah I went to the doctor this week they told me that the good news is I had a UTI and I I've been fighting this booger all week I got out of this bed this morning with a fever I didn't call in sick many of you know what the UTI is about and how painful it is and how sick that you are I didn't send a note in and say pray for you next week the good news if if it is a UTI if it is an infection that'll be the good news the good news is if it's not cancer that's a good news we talk about paying a price come on Church come on church it's when you get get yourself out of bed when you don't feel like [Applause] it I want to walk I want to walk across Jordan and and the and the great stand there and say brother Ron thank youen I want to shake brother brandom's hand personally and tell him I did all that I could I believed it the best that I could I don't want to walk up and tell him I I you know I just did it when it was convenient is that all right brother brandham said the devil hates me and I know he hates you too he hates and he's my enemy but as long as God is my friend I don't have no fear of him that's right am I drive him right back and take the word of God and move him right on back and out of the place that he thinks that he's holding and he has got he hasn't got no strongholds he's absolutely legally fitted in every defeated in every place the devil hasn't got one legal right at all nowhere he's just a devil he's just a devil listen this is one of my favorite quote it's just cancer that's right why don't you put your greatest problem right here it's just depression come on come on let's hear it right now it's just cancer name your greatest problem right here's a good spot to do it so the devil knows sir he hasn't got no legal right to any man that'll accept the promise of Jesus Christ he's whipped he's whipped in sickness he's whipped in disappointments he's whipped in everything he's whipped in death he can't scare me he can't scare you that's all he is is a shadow Jesus would be at his weakest he would be at his weakest Connie would make me clean that up so I'm going to clean it up he was at his weakest now he's been baptized and now we know who he is brother Doug he fast for 40 days as a man he's at his weakest I think you've got a picture of that when he's at his weakest 40 days fast then the Devil Comes amen and the devil begins to make him an offer he don't just make brother brandom an offer and Moses an offer and you an offer listen he knows who Jesus is he's been watching his lineage he knows all the women that's come down through he's been watching him and now he gets baptized the devil was there too he comes to church he'll talk to you out of coming but he'll come with cuz you can feel him a lot of times he's right here but after the word preaching just I don't want to make him welcome I really don't want to make him welcome so he comes and now Jesus has purpose in his life now his purpose he came to the Earth on this coming to Die For You amen he come with one purpose in mind to heal you to save you and he come to die for you he's going to pay the ultimate cost let me just say as human beings none of us like rejection none of us like to be talked bad about none of us want to be hated but he come here for all of that to happen so Satan makes him an offer now he offers him the kingdoms of the world three offers he makes him the off he makes him an offer to be the kingdom of the world now brother brandham said I going to just take this one he even showed him the United States of America and all of her greatness to be king over us wouldn't that be great to have Jesus as king over us that'd be a lot better than what we've got an option on I think what a disgrace now here's what brother brandom said you don't have to take my word for it he said he was tempted to take it brother Ben Satan can make you offers that you in your human flesh if you don't have the Holy Ghost if you don't have the Hol Holy Ghost you'll be tempted tempted to take it now what is he doing he's offering him a kingdom without Calvary because Calvary is the ultimate price let me just say if he takes it me and you are still in bondage me and you are still in sin me and you have no right to the healing power of Jesus Christ the cancer that I fight let me just say this to you I can't stand and Proclaim Liberty if he takes the offer let me just say the amount of Temptation is the victory your Mount of Temptation is your victory [Applause] here's where the cost comes in when you turn him down well brother brand brother Ron what is it okay for a young person it may be Miss America it may be Mr Superman are you with me yeah but I would rather marry somebody that smells funny that's Godly that don't have a Penny to their name that it's Godly that knows how to pray and knows how to be a real Christian I'd rather have that person I'd rather have that person than to marry a millionaires you need an example go back and listen to choosing of a bride two couples one couple Rich one purple very poor and living in a railroad car with tacky buttons brother brandom said which would you choose not the couple that's rich and up there fussing and fighting he said I'd rather be down there in that railroad cow sir let me just say this you God's not going to marry a wife that's all pumped and plender Hollywood he's going to marry a wife that's got real character that's fought the fight right here here's where your fight's going to be young people sometimes you see an older couple and they've been through life you see a big home you see a fine car you think that's what I'm going to have let me just say you didn't see them in a tent you didn't see them driving an old junky car with rust all over it you didn't see them when
