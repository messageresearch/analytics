[25:08] a like a sunday school type of deal
[25:10] there so so i'd give you something to
[25:13] look forward to
[25:14] also concerning the statements that we
[25:16] made about brother ron last evening i
[25:18] know that there were some that
[25:20] thought we were kind of referring to the
[25:22] meetings in the past we only reason we
[25:24] are saying those things is because the
[25:26] doctors have kind of clamped down on
[25:29] some things
[25:30] and so that has nothing to do with the
[25:31] meetings that brother ron has been in
[25:33] part of in the last month and two
[25:35] and so we're only doing that for the
[25:38] for our pastor and for his strength and
[25:40] that's what the doctors want to do is to
[25:43] see him regain his strength he's not
[25:45] just battling a a cold here but iran is
[25:48] taking the highest dose of chemotherapy
[25:50] and that you could possibly be taking
[25:53] and so we're just trying to get his
[25:54] strength regained to him and we will
[25:56] reevaluate all of those things
[25:59] and i i appreciate you as a congregation
[26:02] being so mindful of all of those things
[26:04] so brother brother
[26:06] william and brother mark will be taking
[26:08] the services next weekend and we want to
[26:10] be in prayer for those things i know
[26:11] that god has been lining up some things
[26:13] even for the brothers for this coming
[26:15] weekend and so we're just we're looking
[26:17] forward to what god is doing amongst us
[26:20] let's just sing that song

[45:08] revelation
[45:09] of the power of the blood amen let's
[45:12] stand this morning as we get ready to
[45:13] change the order of service over to
[45:15] brother john
[45:16] i remember
[45:19] the day he came
[45:22] [Music]
[45:25] and walked into
[45:27] my life
[45:33] he pulled me from
[45:36] a life of
[45:38] sin
[45:41] oh
[45:42] to be a part of his bride
[45:47] [Music]
[45:51] but now there's been
[45:53] [Music]
[45:54] a change in me
[45:58] [Music]
[46:00] i used to see things one way
[46:04] but now so differently
[46:09] and god is one thing
[46:12] and it still remakes us
[46:16] and it will never change
[46:25] or lost
[46:30] it stands up strong and tall
[46:34] unlike a mighty melting
[46:38] that will never fall
[46:53] you stand
[46:57] [Music]
[47:06] and you can see
[47:08] [Music]
[47:15] you can have
[47:17] that
[47:18] that sweet peace within
[47:24] or you can sing and you can shout
[47:33] you see there was a day
[47:36] on mount calvary
[47:40] [Music]
[47:42] when he embraced the cross
[47:46] so you could be set free
[47:51] god is one thing
[47:54] and it still
[47:56] remains to say
[47:58] and it will never change
[48:02] no we will never never
[48:12] it stands up strong and tall
[48:16] just like a mighty melting
[48:29] of god's own hand
[48:38] it stands up strong and tall
[48:42] just like a mighty melting
[48:46] that
[48:53] the
[48:53] strength of god's own hands
[48:59] [Music]
[49:06] hallelujah aren't you glad that love
[49:08] still stands yes
[49:12] [Music]

[49:20] amen
[49:21] amen well i was really quite sick this
[49:23] week and
[49:25] and had some sort of a
[49:27] cold or something like that but god
[49:30] touched us yesterday and we were able to
[49:32] come to service last night
[49:34] what a powerful sermon that was preached
[49:37] here last night i hope you i hope you
[49:40] got a hold of that
[49:41] amen so good to be here to stand here
[49:43] with you this morning and we love you
[49:45] with all of our hearts why don't you
[49:47] just turn to your neighbor so listen to
[49:48] church
[49:53] amen
[49:54] amen
[49:55] we so love you
[49:57] we had wonderful meetings that brother
[49:59] had brother tim pruitt's
[50:01] there and then we had meetings that
[50:04] brother kelly held the branch just
[50:05] before that
[50:07] and uh
[50:08] amen so
[50:10] you heard that was a mandate going on my
[50:12] boys have to take care of me so
[50:14] and that was we had wonderful meetings
[50:17] but the doctors came home and said
[50:18] that's enough of that so
[50:20] amen so they are there
[50:23] they're doing their best to take care of
[50:24] me and and they they kind of whip me
[50:26] like my daddy did years ago so
[50:29] amen we certainly love you with all of
[50:31] our hearts and god is doing some
[50:32] incredible things if you will turn with
[50:35] me in your scriptures this morning
[50:38] maybe some of you watched the first
[50:40] service that i spoke at brother tim
[50:42] pruitt's
[50:43] and uh i want to speak part two of that
[50:46] here
[50:47] but i'll catch part one just for a few
[50:49] minutes and then go into part two i'd
[50:52] like to speak to you on naaman
[50:56] the secret life
[50:59] and part two of that
[51:01] two barrels of dirt
[51:04] amen and that second part is pretty
[51:06] important this morning so
[51:08] amen amen so maybe you that heard it
[51:12] before
[51:13] you know i preached a part of this a
[51:15] couple years ago and i thought well i've
[51:17] already preached on naaman year before
[51:20] but the lord dealt with me to speak it
[51:22] again this morning
[51:23] and i i then it just hit me well most of
[51:26] us can't remember what we had for
[51:27] breakfast yesterday so
[51:30] so we we won't mind a rerun and
[51:34] and brother daniel williams always said
[51:36] if you get it hot enough
[51:38] it'll be good
[51:40] even leftovers are good
[51:42] so i don't believe we've got leftovers
[51:44] this morning but we're we're just want
[51:46] to touch into the inspiration of what
[51:48] god wants to speak to us this morning
[51:51] in second kings chapter 5 in verse 1 one
[51:53] verse and then we'll go to luke chapter
[51:55] 4 and verse 23
[51:58] now naaman the captain of the host of
[52:00] the king of syria
[52:02] was a great man
[52:04] with his master
[52:06] and honorable
[52:08] because by him
[52:10] the lord had given deliverance unto
[52:14] syria
[52:16] he was also a mighty man in valor
[52:20] i won't i don't mind telling you all of
[52:22] those words i wouldn't mind having said
[52:24] about me
[52:27] i i don't you know every one of us would
[52:29] be thrilled jumping through the roof if
[52:31] god allowed the writer to say that about
[52:34] me
[52:36] comma
[52:38] but he
[52:39] was a leper
[52:42] luke chapter 4 and verse
[52:44] 23. and he said unto them ye shall
[52:48] surely say unto me this proverb
[52:50] physician heal thyself
[52:53] whatsoever we have heard done in
[52:56] capernaum do also in the country
[52:59] and he said verily i say unto you no
[53:02] prophet is accepted in his own country
[53:05] but i tell you of truth that many widows
[53:08] were in israel in the days of elias when
[53:11] the heaven was shut up three years and
[53:13] six months when great famine was
[53:16] throughout all the land
[53:18] but none of them
[53:20] was elias sent
[53:23] saved this seraphim
[53:25] in the city of sidon unto a woman that
[53:29] was a widow
[53:31] and many lepers
[53:33] were in israel in the time of elias the
[53:37] prophet
[53:38] and none of them was cleansed
[53:41] saving naaman
[53:43] the syrian
[53:45] jesus remembers
[53:47] even in that moment
[53:49] second kings chapter 5 and verse 15.
[53:53] now this is naaman and he returned unto
[53:56] the man of god and he and all of his
[53:58] company and said
[53:59] and he stood before him
[54:02] and he said behold now
[54:04] i know that there is no god in all the
[54:07] earth
[54:08] but in israel
[54:10] what a statement
[54:12] now therefore i pray thee take a
[54:14] blessing of thy servant
[54:17] but he said as the lord liveth
[54:20] before whom i stand
[54:22] i will receive none
[54:24] and he urged him to take it but he
[54:27] refused
[54:29] and naaman said shall there not then i
[54:32] pray thee be given to thy servant two
[54:34] mules
[54:36] of burden of earth
[54:39] for thy servant will henceforth offer
[54:42] neither
[54:43] burnt offerings or sacrifices unto other
[54:46] gods
[54:47] but unto
[54:49] the lord
[54:51] you may be seated this morning may the
[54:53] lord bless the reading of his word so
[54:55] good to see you in the house of the lord
[54:57] good to have friends with us among us
[54:58] today and amen we certainly love you i
[55:01] don't know if you've looked at the trees
[55:03] god's getting ready to paint us a
[55:04] beautiful picture over the next three
[55:07] weeks so you enjoy that you're living in
[55:09] the prettiest part in the world
[55:12] don't take it for granted
[55:14] you're watching a season of life as it
[55:16] goes by and it's god does his incredible
[55:18] painting over the next few
[55:21] next few days and so
[55:23] enjoy that if you get a chance go up on
[55:25] the mountain big meadows some of you
[55:27] know that is a famous
[55:28] story but go up to big meadows and enjoy
[55:31] the leaves
[55:32] leaves
[55:40] god bless you brother jordan i love you
[55:42] with all my heart
[55:49] naaman
[55:53] this man was a a war hero
[55:57] this man was a liberator of syria
[56:01] this man was a fulfiller a prophecy of
[56:04] elijah
[56:05] this man would would would be
[56:08] responsible for
[56:09] taking even ahab's lives
[56:13] to fulfill the
[56:14] prophecy this man would uh would be an
[56:18] honorable man a very loyal man
[56:21] he would be a man that would set in
[56:22] king's councils and he would be a man
[56:25] that would be sitting in the inner
[56:27] circles of the most highest of the
[56:29] country
[56:30] he would be a man that's honored
[56:33] a man that is very looked up to
[56:36] a man that is has great social status as
[56:38] well as
[56:40] great honor
[56:41] all of us would love to have naaman in
[56:43] our family all of us would love to have
[56:45] him in our homes to have dinner
[56:48] all of us would like to be a part of his
[56:50] life
[56:52] to the outside it looks like naaman is a
[56:55] man that is has his whole act together
[56:58] life is perfect
[57:00] no doubt had an incredible home
[57:03] uh no doubt had a had a lot of people
[57:05] that work for him
[57:07] uh commanded when he commanded he
[57:09] commanded thousands and thousands of
[57:12] soldiers under him
[57:14] he answered only to the king
[57:16] he had a direct friendship with the king
[57:19] none of them knew naaman like the people
[57:22] in his house knew him
[57:24] because naaman lived a secret life
[57:30] whether we realize there are not many
[57:32] people that set in churches
[57:34] live secret lives
[57:40] especially in this age of computers and
[57:43] this age of
[57:44] of uh
[57:46] a media that we have it's easy to live a
[57:50] secret life on a phone
[57:53] or a computer or an ipad
[57:57] and uh and it is a curse to you
[58:01] naaman was a leper
[58:04] now to understand what leprosy was it
[58:06] was the most dreaded disease
[58:10] in israel or anywhere in the world to
[58:13] have leprosy
[58:15] meant that your fingers would rot off
[58:18] your arms would rot off your limbs would
[58:20] rot off your nose would rot off it
[58:24] started out to where that your skin
[58:26] would become become deteriorated and it
[58:29] was it was a it was actually almost like
[58:32] a cancer that was a flesh-eating disease
[58:35] and it stunk it was rotten
[58:40] to be a leopard and to declare be
[58:42] declared a leper you would be exiled
[58:46] because it was hugely
[58:49] it was believed to be you could be
[58:52] handed by touch or feel
[58:54] but but but leprosy would exile you from
[58:58] your community from your family
[59:00] definitely from your standing
[59:03] so when naaman becomes leprous
[59:09] it is believed that naaman became
[59:12] leprous
[59:13] because in the battle against israel
[59:18] he took a little girl
[59:21] and he brought her home as a slave girl
[59:25] some writers actually say that
[59:27] from the event of taking this girl as a
[59:30] slave and bringing her into his home
[59:33] caused leprosy to get on his body
[59:37] i don't know that i'm just
[59:38] just letting you know that but let me
[59:40] just let me just share this to you in
[59:42] his battles
[59:44] he would take treasures from the wars
[59:47] this day he took somebody that was more
[59:50] powerful than him a real believer
[59:53] and he brought her to his house
[59:55] now let me just say when naaman would
[59:57] walk through the door outside of the
[1:00:00] door
[1:00:01] everybody revered him everybody loved
[1:00:04] him everybody listened to every word he
[1:00:06] said but when he came home and he took
[1:00:09] his armor off
[1:00:12] and he started unwrapping because
[1:00:15] leprosy stinks
[1:00:18] and he has to be able to wrap it so to
[1:00:20] wear that it doesn't that people in the
[1:00:23] room doesn't smell the stink of his body
[1:00:27] so he has to live an extremely
[1:00:30] secretive life
[1:00:32] are you with me now
[1:00:34] are you with me
[1:00:35] it's just like sin
[1:00:38] it's just like sin it just infiltrates
[1:00:41] it's in in your life and many times it
[1:00:43] comes in innocently
[1:00:45] innocently it comes in and you just take
[1:00:48] on a spirit and then that spirit begins
[1:00:50] to lead you and then you have to hide it
[1:00:53] from your wife and you hide it from your
[1:00:55] family i'm preaching to somebody now
[1:00:57] you hide it from your neighborhood and
[1:01:00] they see you as somebody else that you
[1:01:02] project but that's not who you are
[1:01:05] you see
[1:01:07] naaman was a leopard
[1:01:08] but he projected himself as a war hero
[1:01:14] are you with me now
[1:01:16] so naaman was would come home and unwrap
[1:01:20] himself
[1:01:21] and and he would begin to wash himself
[1:01:24] and try to get the stink off of himself
[1:01:26] and every day there was a deterioration
[1:01:28] that was going on
[1:01:31] but naaman was though he be this
[1:01:34] powerful
[1:01:35] in the nation
[1:01:37] he was not the most powerful person in
[1:01:40] his home
[1:01:40] [Applause]
[1:01:47] outside of his home he was the most
[1:01:49] powerful
[1:01:50] but inside of his home there was a slave
[1:01:54] girl
[1:01:55] that believed the message of the hour
[1:01:59] that though she be an alien in another
[1:02:02] country this was not her home this was
[1:02:05] not her family this was not her
[1:02:07] community these were not her friends
[1:02:11] but though she be taken from her
[1:02:14] homeland believe in a prophet of the
[1:02:16] hour and she was captive now and taken
[1:02:20] to naaman's home believed to be taken
[1:02:22] care of extremely well no doubt this
[1:02:25] home was a better home than she lived in
[1:02:27] back home no doubt she was treated
[1:02:30] better nobody else she ate better
[1:02:34] but it did not change her belief system
[1:02:37] whatsoever
[1:02:39] this family worshiped idols
[1:02:44] this first this family worshiped false
[1:02:47] gods but this little girl still believed
[1:02:51] in the holy god of israel
[1:02:54] she still believed that elijah was the
[1:02:57] prophet of the
[1:03:00] hour amen
[1:03:03] now being more powerful than than naaman
[1:03:07] i'm saying that because
[1:03:10] as a slave girl she had power
[1:03:14] to deliver him
[1:03:17] whether you know this or not as
[1:03:19] believers of the message of the hour
[1:03:23] you carry a commission inside of you to
[1:03:26] be witnesses of the message of this day
[1:03:30] and it is deliverance over sin
[1:03:34] over every habit
[1:03:36] the blood of jesus christ has more power
[1:03:40] than every devil that's in hell
[1:03:48] this little girl
[1:03:50] she could
[1:03:52] she could honestly
[1:03:55] hate naaman
[1:03:57] have a grudge against him
[1:03:59] let me just say this the power of
[1:04:02] unforgiveness
[1:04:06] is a tremendous hindrance to a christian
[1:04:11] the power to not forgive
[1:04:14] the power to hold
[1:04:16] deliverance
[1:04:18] was something that she personally had to
[1:04:21] deal with
[1:04:22] [Music]
[1:04:24] because the quicker she die that he dies
[1:04:28] the quicker i'll be set free
[1:04:31] she could easily rationalize that
[1:04:36] one day she came to a point in the
[1:04:38] conversation
[1:04:40] till she actually spoke up to the to the
[1:04:42] master of the house
[1:04:45] and she said what the god that you would
[1:04:47] go to a prophet in in israel
[1:04:52] he could deliver you
[1:04:55] of that leprosy
[1:05:01] he could deliver you of that leprosy
[1:05:04] i want you to understand he couldn't go
[1:05:06] the doctor
[1:05:09] he couldn't go to a pharmacy
[1:05:11] he couldn't even go to a witch to try to
[1:05:14] help him out
[1:05:15] he could go to no one because now it
[1:05:17] would become news outside of his house
[1:05:20] but here is this slave girl telling him
[1:05:24] i can tell you were to be delivered
[1:05:29] now understand this
[1:05:31] no
[1:05:32] leper had ever been healed
[1:05:37] amen
[1:05:38] no leopard had ever been healed but this
[1:05:41] little girl had a revelation
[1:05:46] she had a revelation if you can give to
[1:05:49] the prophet
[1:05:52] the god of israel can heal you
[1:05:55] though none had ever been healed let me
[1:05:58] just say there's no case that is
[1:06:00] impossible to god
[1:06:12] now
[1:06:13] legion has to make a decision
[1:06:16] and in his decision he has to go to his
[1:06:18] king
[1:06:20] and he has to reveal to his king and
[1:06:22] find favor with the king
[1:06:24] i'm leprous
[1:06:26] let me just say this to you that's the
[1:06:28] first step for deliverance
[1:06:31] is confession amen
[1:06:34] that's the first step to real
[1:06:36] deliverance of your secret life
[1:06:42] i'm sorry i'm not taking enough time on
[1:06:44] that but living a secret life will only
[1:06:47] cause you to be a slave
[1:06:52] it'll only cause you to be a slave
[1:07:00] he has to confess to the king
[1:07:02] he has to get the permission from the
[1:07:04] king to write a letter to the king of
[1:07:06] israel
[1:07:07] to accept him to come to his country
[1:07:11] that he might see the prophet of israel
[1:07:15] listen when israel's king gets this
[1:07:17] letter he thinks it's a provocation of
[1:07:20] war
[1:07:21] this man is an enemy
[1:07:24] this man has led an incredible victory
[1:07:26] for syria and deliver them and now
[1:07:29] they're over here and there and now he
[1:07:32] wants to come and see our prophet
[1:07:36] this is a trick
[1:07:39] come on
[1:07:41] now i want you to just notice
[1:07:43] he packs up all of this incredible
[1:07:45] wealth
[1:07:47] and he brings his men with him
[1:07:50] and naaman wants to get delivered on his
[1:07:52] terms
[1:07:56] a lot of people want to serve god on
[1:07:58] their terms
[1:08:04] they want to serve him when it's
[1:08:05] convenient
[1:08:07] they want to live a half and half life
[1:08:11] amen
[1:08:12] are you with me now
[1:08:14] they don't want all the work they just
[1:08:16] want the portion that is convenient to
[1:08:17] them
[1:08:21] they want the blessings without the cost
[1:08:24] they want to be associated
[1:08:28] they want to be a spectator but they
[1:08:30] really don't want to put any spit in the
[1:08:32] game
[1:08:33] [Music]
[1:08:35] jesus said you've got to take up your
[1:08:37] cross and follow me
[1:08:40] first of all you must be born again
[1:08:44] there's no bypassing that
[1:08:50] people have incredible things that they
[1:08:52] have done in life
[1:08:54] and done a lot of things maybe for the
[1:08:56] cancer society libraries built at them
[1:08:59] after them buildings built schools built
[1:09:02] after them but let me just say this if
[1:09:04] you don't have jesus in your life
[1:09:07] you're facing the judgment and hell lays
[1:09:10] before you
[1:09:12] but you don't have to go that way
[1:09:15] [Music]
[1:09:20] a song that has said i i did it my way
[1:09:26] it's written
[1:09:28] it's written amongst even this in the
[1:09:30] last hundred years i did it my way
[1:09:33] elvis presley was one
[1:09:35] that made it popular
[1:09:37] other men sang it
[1:09:40] a lot of people live it
[1:09:43] my uncle had it played at his funeral
[1:09:48] i did it
[1:09:50] i did it my way
[1:09:52] it is a signature song
[1:09:54] for satanic worship
[1:09:59] you can't do it your way
[1:10:02] you can't serve god your way
[1:10:08] are you with me
[1:10:10] you can't do it your way
[1:10:12] oh you can but there's a cost to it
[1:10:18] well i'm only going to do it my way do
[1:10:20] it
[1:10:23] you'll only prove what's on the inside
[1:10:24] of you boy i love last night's service
[1:10:28] so what we do we begin to adopt things
[1:10:31] like this i'm only going to go so far
[1:10:33] so we adopt a so far religion
[1:10:37] there is a sin
[1:10:39] that my little buddy preaches the sin of
[1:10:41] refusing to go all the way amen
[1:10:47] sin to
[1:10:49] not go either way
[1:10:54] i want to be followers of jesus
[1:10:56] or followers of the message
[1:10:59] or associated with it
[1:11:01] or maybe just a spectator of it
[1:11:05] because there's benefits that goes along
[1:11:06] with that
[1:11:08] but really there's no reward if you
[1:11:10] don't go all the way
[1:11:13] the scripture said many run in the race
[1:11:15] but only him that finishes gets the
[1:11:17] prize
[1:11:21] i am determined in my life
[1:11:24] however long that god allows me to live
[1:11:27] at this juncture and i believe i can say
[1:11:30] this with power
[1:11:31] i don't want to hold back none
[1:11:38] i just went and preached the meeting and
[1:11:40] and people got coveted
[1:11:42] that was there
[1:11:44] i wrote brother tim because i understand
[1:11:46] that
[1:11:47] sometimes we as host pastors
[1:11:50] we hate to see people get sick we hate
[1:11:52] to see people come out of that after god
[1:11:55] has done some tremendous blessings
[1:11:57] and i wrote him a note and i said i want
[1:11:59] you to understand i knew the risk before
[1:12:02] i came
[1:12:03] amen
[1:12:04] i knew the risk before i came
[1:12:07] and i knew what the reward would be
[1:12:10] i
[1:12:11] am always willing
[1:12:14] to risk my own life
[1:12:16] to get the reward
[1:12:21] some of you may not like that but that's
[1:12:23] just how it is
[1:12:31] let's see lord
[1:12:33] i'll let that sit there just for a
[1:12:35] minute for you
[1:12:37] you see
[1:12:38] some of the reward of last week was
[1:12:41] deliverances come from a sermon like
[1:12:43] this
[1:12:44] people that had turned away from the
[1:12:46] message that had
[1:12:48] that actually spoke bad against it for
[1:12:50] years
[1:12:51] and now came back to jesus christ
[1:12:54] i would say the reward is greater than
[1:12:57] the risk
[1:13:00] and i wrote brother tim that not when
[1:13:03] i'm feeling healthy today but i wrote it
[1:13:06] when i was extremely sick this week
[1:13:10] and he was telling me how sorry that he
[1:13:12] was that i was sick and i wrote him and
[1:13:14] i said it was worth the risk
[1:13:21] well your amens is not as great as what
[1:13:23] they was but
[1:13:31] but if we lived in a day where that if
[1:13:33] you got caught
[1:13:34] in a message church
[1:13:38] and they are going to take your life
[1:13:39] would you still come
[1:13:44] we as americans get in our car we drive
[1:13:47] down the road most of us are driving
[1:13:50] down the road and something pretty
[1:13:51] comfortable we get in our car we drive
[1:13:53] down the road
[1:13:55] we get a little upset if it's too hot or
[1:13:57] too cold or
[1:13:58] we drive down the road we get out of our
[1:14:00] car we walk into the church
[1:14:03] we sit down in a pretty decent pretty
[1:14:06] decent seat
[1:14:09] there's no police or man that's going to
[1:14:11] come and arrest you for
[1:14:13] being a christian
[1:14:15] they're not going to haul you away to
[1:14:17] some labor camp for seven to 10 years
[1:14:24] we still live in america
[1:14:26] we're proving every day that we don't
[1:14:28] believe god in america anymore
[1:14:30] amen
[1:14:32] we did that behind by how we voted
[1:14:34] [Applause]
[1:14:37] we proved it we told god it's god you're
[1:14:39] ready we're ready the sodom conditions
[1:14:40] over so we voted
[1:14:43] and now look what we've got
[1:14:46] and i am neither way
[1:14:51] understand
[1:15:00] but in china
[1:15:03] they don't vote
[1:15:06] but when the message came to them
[1:15:09] they didn't ask us americans for money
[1:15:15] they produced the books for themselves
[1:15:18] and the churches
[1:15:20] and i preached in a very cold night
[1:15:24] setting in an open garden to about two
[1:15:26] to three hundred people
[1:15:29] sitting in very thick coats
[1:15:32] with policemen outside
[1:15:34] waiting outside
[1:15:37] and actually coming in and taking
[1:15:39] pictures
[1:15:41] now some of those men have spent
[1:15:44] much time in prison
[1:15:47] but there's no giving up
[1:15:52] i just received a letter from one the
[1:15:53] other day and he's admonishing his
[1:15:56] people
[1:15:57] don't give up
[1:15:59] this ain't no time to give up
[1:16:01] i may be incarcerated but i'm not giving
[1:16:04] up myself don't you give up
[1:16:13] now your trial is the opposite way
[1:16:18] so don't sit like you're out of danger
[1:16:20] your danger is laodicea
[1:16:23] and soft living
[1:16:27] your dangerous worldism creeping in and
[1:16:30] sabotaging you
[1:16:35] naaman was saying i want to do it my way
[1:16:38] like a lot of americans do i want to do
[1:16:40] it my way
[1:16:41] [Music]
[1:16:45] so finally he gets to get to come to
[1:16:47] elisha
[1:16:48] and elisha doesn't even come out to see
[1:16:51] you
[1:16:53] i imagine most of you would be mad
[1:16:56] i'm sorry this audi this congregation is
[1:16:58] in a kind of a different situation than
[1:17:00] those most congregations
[1:17:03] most congregations would be very upset
[1:17:04] if the pastor didn't come out and shake
[1:17:06] their hand and i hope you can give me
[1:17:08] some patience on that
[1:17:11] because of the almost two years of of
[1:17:14] of the highest form of chemotherapy
[1:17:16] they're telling me that i'm at a zero
[1:17:18] a zero uh
[1:17:21] immunity
[1:17:22] and so for me to be extremely careful so
[1:17:25] both places brother tim and brother
[1:17:27] kelly brother ray erickson's group was
[1:17:29] extremely careful with me getting me in
[1:17:31] and out of the meeting
[1:17:33] and you know i heard the rumors that i
[1:17:35] didn't shake their hands but you know
[1:17:36] it's just a stage in my life
[1:17:39] at least i'm still willing to come into
[1:17:41] public and preach to people
[1:17:52] so he comes to elisha and elisha doesn't
[1:17:55] even go out to see
[1:17:57] he sends gehasa out
[1:18:00] now no doubt naaman has been used to red
[1:18:02] carpet treatment he's been used to the
[1:18:04] finer things of the life and here is a
[1:18:07] servant coming out
[1:18:09] and telling him what the word of the
[1:18:11] lord is for him to do
[1:18:14] and the instruction is go washing jordan
[1:18:19] jordan is the nastiest stinkiest
[1:18:22] muddiest river that there is
[1:18:26] and very quickly
[1:18:28] naaman says well there's other bodies of
[1:18:31] water that is much cleaner that is much
[1:18:34] fresher that smells a whole lot better
[1:18:37] i'd be willing to go there
[1:18:40] and he gets extremely upset the
[1:18:42] scripture tells you that he gets upset
[1:18:45] almost refusing to go
[1:18:47] man of god didn't come out speak to me
[1:18:49] personally the man of god has sent his
[1:18:52] servant out here and now he wants me to
[1:18:54] go to a mighty stinking river brother
[1:18:57] branham said there was a there was a
[1:18:59] slave
[1:19:00] and this master would would
[1:19:03] would come down and be with him and he
[1:19:05] was always singing he was always happy
[1:19:07] he was always whistling
[1:19:08] and he asked him he said why are you so
[1:19:10] happy being a slave
[1:19:12] he said i've met the lord
[1:19:15] i've had an experience with the lord
[1:19:17] and he said i'd like to have that and he
[1:19:18] said well you got to go to the hog pin
[1:19:28] i ain't willing to go to that altar and
[1:19:30] cry and boohoo and repent for all my
[1:19:32] sins and
[1:19:33] pray through to god and
[1:19:35] you know everybody else look at me
[1:19:42] he said well that's what you got to do
[1:19:45] day after day this master would come to
[1:19:47] him wanting
[1:19:49] because if you ever get thirsty for
[1:19:50] jesus there ain't nothing else so
[1:19:52] satisfied
[1:19:54] and this this man came and he kept
[1:19:56] coming to him said i want to get what
[1:19:58] you got are you willing to go the
[1:19:59] hawkins are you willing to go the hog
[1:20:01] pin and one day he came and he was fully
[1:20:04] resolved i'm willing to do whatever it
[1:20:07] takes
[1:20:08] to get what you got
[1:20:11] come on let's live a life to where
[1:20:13] people will want what we've got
[1:20:18] people go around with a negative
[1:20:20] attitude all the time i don't know what
[1:20:21] they got
[1:20:23] sad all the time i don't want what they
[1:20:25] got
[1:20:26] imitations of christianity i don't know
[1:20:29] what they got i want the real thing we
[1:20:32] can have the real thing because it's at
[1:20:34] our disposal
[1:20:48] he came down he told the slave he said
[1:20:50] i'm willing to go to the hog pin today
[1:20:52] he said you don't have to go to the hog
[1:20:54] pin you just got to be willing
[1:21:01] naaman had some servants that told him
[1:21:03] said the man of god told you what to do
[1:21:05] oh yeah come on
[1:21:08] and reminded him
[1:21:10] you got to humble yourself
[1:21:12] yes sir
[1:21:14] i think that's one of the most powerful
[1:21:15] sermons that brother branham preaches
[1:21:20] brother orman neville
[1:21:22] had made a mix-up
[1:21:24] he thought
[1:21:26] had made a mix-up he invited another
[1:21:28] preacher
[1:21:29] to come preach
[1:21:31] and he also invited brother branham
[1:21:34] brother branham starts his sermon
[1:21:36] and brother neville quickly apologizes
[1:21:39] you can hear it it's all on tape you can
[1:21:42] hear it he said brother brother branham
[1:21:44] i'm so sorry
[1:21:45] i'm so sorry that i
[1:21:47] i've i've invited this other brother to
[1:21:49] preach i'm sorry brother brown is just
[1:21:52] as
[1:21:53] oh he's just as cordial as he can
[1:21:54] possibly be he said why sure we want to
[1:21:57] hear him this morning and this man got
[1:21:59] up it's not on tape what that man said
[1:22:01] but
[1:22:02] he got up and he preached about two
[1:22:04] hours
[1:22:07] well that man was a kingdom builder in
[1:22:09] the message
[1:22:11] he was anti-holy ghost moving
[1:22:15] he would cause much damage to the
[1:22:17] message through the years
[1:22:20] but brother branham came out up after
[1:22:22] him
[1:22:23] and spoke for about 20 minutes on the
[1:22:25] most powerful sermon
[1:22:29] called
[1:22:30] humble thyself
[1:22:35] it was the recipe for that man
[1:22:39] that spoke two hours just before brother
[1:22:41] branham gave him the recipe
[1:22:44] of what he really needed
[1:22:46] i'm preaching to you now
[1:22:48] a lot of people want to be well but they
[1:22:51] don't want to take the drug
[1:22:54] they don't want to take the prescription
[1:22:56] repent and be baptized every one of you
[1:22:59] in the name of the lord jesus christ for
[1:23:01] the remission of your sins
[1:23:05] count rosary beach does not
[1:23:07] take care of your sins
[1:23:09] getting a preacher to put his finger on
[1:23:11] your forehead does not take care of your
[1:23:13] sins
[1:23:14] [Applause]
[1:23:17] you gotta repent
[1:23:22] [Applause]
[1:23:27] [Music]
[1:23:33] naaman surrendered himself
[1:23:35] and humbled himself
[1:23:37] and went to jordan
[1:23:39] and there he dipped seven times
[1:23:43] can you imagine the word going around
[1:23:45] through the community of of israel
[1:23:50] all the leper colonies that there was
[1:23:53] the curse that was upon them
[1:23:56] and here comes a man from another
[1:23:58] country
[1:24:00] because a girl that was a believer in
[1:24:02] the message of the hour
[1:24:04] [Applause]
[1:24:05] that there's nothing impossible with god
[1:24:08] if this man would go take the recipe
[1:24:13] if he would just go take the inoculation
[1:24:16] i'm not talking about coving now
[1:24:19] but if you just go take the inoculation
[1:24:21] for sin it's way worse than leprosy
[1:24:25] let me tell you about sin sin will take
[1:24:27] you to hell
[1:24:28] god don't send you to hell
[1:24:30] sin sends you to hell
[1:24:33] send us a choice in your life amen jesus
[1:24:37] talks more about hell than he talks
[1:24:39] about heaven it's a real place you don't
[1:24:42] have to go
[1:24:44] [Applause]
[1:24:57] bless you bored
[1:25:06] i'm sorry
[1:25:13] on the seventh vip
[1:25:15] he came up
[1:25:17] and the secret that had ruled him
[1:25:20] all of these years
[1:25:22] is now god
[1:25:30] brother nathaniel we've had some very
[1:25:32] personal talks
[1:25:34] and
[1:25:36] i'm preaching down your past
[1:25:39] but it wasn't good today
[1:25:41] that the secret
[1:25:43] was gone
[1:25:50] wasn't glad in the day that you really
[1:25:52] knew that you knew that you knew that
[1:25:54] you knew
[1:25:55] that jesus lived in your life
[1:25:58] that day was the first day
[1:26:00] of the rest of your life
[1:26:02] and the secret
[1:26:04] of your past
[1:26:06] we're not here to rejoice or make that
[1:26:09] some great thing
[1:26:10] we're very sorrow and shameful that we
[1:26:12] live that kind of a life but jesus made
[1:26:15] the ultimate difference in our life
[1:26:19] getting ready to marry two kids
[1:26:22] both of them repented and been baptized
[1:26:24] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:26:26] amen
[1:26:30] staying past
[1:26:32] that's gone
[1:26:35] and you don't have to live with that
[1:26:36] thing that i'll go back i'll go back
[1:26:38] i'll go back because if you truly get
[1:26:40] washed there ain't no going back
[1:26:52] and let me just say if you live in fear
[1:26:54] of going back
[1:26:56] you haven't went far enough
[1:26:59] [Music]
[1:27:00] [Applause]
[1:27:01] somebody help me preach now if you live
[1:27:03] in fear of going back
[1:27:06] you haven't went far enough
[1:27:14] hallelujah
[1:27:18] i never live a day of my life as
[1:27:22] of now i never live a day in my life in
[1:27:25] fear of this cancer
[1:27:28] because god's greater than the cancer
[1:27:30] but i never live in fear of my past
[1:27:33] because god washed my past away
[1:27:37] and it says though i never did it in the
[1:27:39] first place and there's nothing to go
[1:27:42] back to
[1:27:44] that ought to be your testimony there's
[1:27:47] nothing there's nothing there's nothing
[1:27:50] to go back to
[1:28:04] hey
[1:28:17] he comes back to elisha
[1:28:19] and he wants to give him reward
[1:28:25] and he's brought all these jewels
[1:28:32] and he wants to give elisha the man of
[1:28:35] god
[1:28:37] that no doubt has prayed the prayer and
[1:28:39] felt the leading
[1:28:40] to get him delivered
[1:28:44] i'll say some things right here
[1:28:48] he's wanting to give him all of his
[1:28:49] wealth
[1:28:50] for getting him in this state
[1:28:53] and elisha says
[1:28:55] i'm not about that that's right
[1:28:58] amen
[1:29:00] i i'm not about that
[1:29:02] how different that is than these
[1:29:04] charismatic televangelists
[1:29:07] [Music]
[1:29:11] that are all about money
[1:29:15] that are all about money let me just say
[1:29:18] this to you the kingdom of god is built
[1:29:20] on tithes and offerings
[1:29:22] you pay your tithes you be honest to god
[1:29:24] if you make 10 or 10 million dollars you
[1:29:27] just be honest it's between you and god
[1:29:30] but i'm not selling out for money
[1:29:35] i want this pulpit to always be an
[1:29:37] honest open pulpit to the message of the
[1:29:41] hour and stand pure and clean
[1:29:45] [Applause]
[1:29:47] we won't sell out for popularity we
[1:29:49] won't see a lot for women we won't sell
[1:29:52] out for money
[1:30:08] three kind of believers in every church
[1:30:11] you don't have to stay an unbeliever and
[1:30:12] you don't have to stay and make believe
[1:30:14] them
[1:30:15] but the most dangerous of any of it is
[1:30:18] to make believers amen he is someone
[1:30:20] that has took some steps
[1:30:24] of mercy and grace but he hasn't really
[1:30:26] got full yet
[1:30:29] he is one that brother adam talks about
[1:30:31] in the word to the church that will set
[1:30:33] amongst you for decades
[1:30:36] and then the enemy of hell will shoot
[1:30:38] him full of poison
[1:30:40] and he'll blow the church up
[1:30:43] i want to take it a little bit further
[1:30:44] than that he'll blow your family up
[1:30:48] he'll blow your community up he's a
[1:30:51] terrorist sitting in a church
[1:30:56] split to church with no remorse
[1:31:03] are you with me
[1:31:04] how did they get there they just took on
[1:31:06] a little spirit
[1:31:08] spirit in the spirit world they can see
[1:31:11] that you're feeding on darkness or
[1:31:13] feeding on light
[1:31:20] even satan knows what you're feeding on
[1:31:23] so be careful as christians
[1:31:26] of what you're feeding your soul on
[1:31:31] which dog that you're feeding that's the
[1:31:33] one that's winning the battle in your
[1:31:36] life
[1:31:39] and here was gahesa the one that
[1:31:42] delivered the message of deliverance
[1:31:46] that was a servant to elisha
[1:31:52] he watched
[1:31:54] elisha turn
[1:31:56] down
[1:31:58] turned down the wealth and the
[1:32:00] prosperity
[1:32:02] and naaman left
[1:32:05] naaman left and
[1:32:07] he followed him
[1:32:10] and he asked
[1:32:13] and actually gave
[1:32:15] references to what he was going to do
[1:32:17] with it
[1:32:18] as a lie
[1:32:22] that he was going to give it to servants
[1:32:24] and it would be good for them talents of
[1:32:26] silver and gold and and all kinds of
[1:32:29] different garments
[1:32:32] and he took it for himself and laid it
[1:32:34] on his servants his servants but
[1:32:36] remember the scripture go back and read
[1:32:38] it
[1:32:39] that when he got home he took that
[1:32:41] wealth from the servants and took it
[1:32:43] into his own tent
[1:32:49] i want to talk about two different
[1:32:51] things here
[1:32:52] and this is part two
[1:32:55] when he came back to elisha the man of
[1:32:58] god
[1:33:00] we have several different examples
[1:33:03] david
[1:33:05] was came to by the prophet nathan
[1:33:09] and nathan had been dealt with by god
[1:33:12] that david had a secret sin in his life
[1:33:17] and he told him about a man that had a
[1:33:19] lot of sheep right
[1:33:21] and that man went down to the man that
[1:33:23] had nothing but one ship sheep and he
[1:33:25] took that sheep away from him and david
[1:33:28] got so roth in that sermon and convicted
[1:33:32] he said that man must be put to death
[1:33:34] and nathan looks at him as a man of god
[1:33:38] that's why you gotta have a pastor
[1:33:42] you need a pastor that'll look you in
[1:33:44] the eyes
[1:33:46] and call out the secret things of your
[1:33:48] life
[1:33:51] amen let the word be the discerner of
[1:33:54] the heart
[1:33:56] and nathan told him thou art the man
[1:33:59] david repented immediately
[1:34:02] now let me just say this to you
[1:34:05] david had sowed the seeds
[1:34:09] of sin
[1:34:12] getting right with god didn't cancel the
[1:34:14] harvest
[1:34:16] amen
[1:34:30] you can't cheat on your wife and then
[1:34:32] expect her to trust you
[1:34:37] i'm not preaching to you because we
[1:34:38] don't have that problem here
[1:34:42] you can't cheat on her and then expect
[1:34:45] oh it's pretty good
[1:34:48] you saw the sins you were the filthy
[1:34:50] rotten dirty sinner that sold it
[1:34:54] and then because you got caught you want
[1:34:56] to make it all right
[1:35:00] it'll take decades to fix that thing
[1:35:04] but don't blame your neighbor don't
[1:35:07] blame you pastor don't blame your wife
[1:35:09] don't blame nobody else you are the man
[1:35:12] david
[1:35:15] the blood will never leave your house
[1:35:18] your children will repeat the process
[1:35:35] there was a man named aiken
[1:35:38] that went into a battle
[1:35:41] and he saw a lot of gold
[1:35:43] and in the battle
[1:35:45] he decided i'm not going to leave it
[1:35:48] i'm going to take it home with me the
[1:35:50] commandment was don't bring it home
[1:35:53] don't bring it home
[1:35:55] you know sometimes
[1:35:56] what you think of what god thinks is two
[1:35:58] different levels
[1:36:00] throw away what you think there you go
[1:36:03] amen
[1:36:05] amen
[1:36:06] throw away what you think well this is
[1:36:08] what i think about don't care
[1:36:10] i really don't care
[1:36:12] somebody walked in the office one time
[1:36:14] many years ago and it's been many years
[1:36:16] ago pointed their finger in my face and
[1:36:18] said this is what i think
[1:36:20] and i looked up at him and i said i
[1:36:22] could care less what you think there you
[1:36:24] go
[1:36:25] amen
[1:36:26] as a matter of fact i could care less
[1:36:27] what everybody in this building thinks
[1:36:30] and i can care less what i think
[1:36:33] i only want what god thinks
[1:36:37] i would like this audience of about 200
[1:36:39] people to come to that conclusion this
[1:36:41] morning it's not what i think it's what
[1:36:42] god thinks
[1:36:55] and aiken took it and hid it in his tent
[1:36:58] he thought it was hid god knows
[1:37:00] everything
[1:37:01] god knows everything he's not fooled by
[1:37:03] nothing he knows everything
[1:37:05] he hid in his tent and it brought
[1:37:07] it brought the sowing of that
[1:37:10] brought a harvest of men dying at war
[1:37:14] and joshua immediately knew
[1:37:17] something's wrong here in the church
[1:37:19] i've heard sermons through the years sin
[1:37:22] in the camps sin in the camp i'm not
[1:37:23] preaching that now but here's what i'm
[1:37:25] preaching to you if there's something in
[1:37:27] your life get it out you get it out
[1:37:30] you don't need god to come and tell you
[1:37:32] you know what you've got going on in
[1:37:33] your life today is the first day of the
[1:37:36] rest of your life
[1:37:40] quit selling yourself excuses of why not
[1:37:43] to do it
[1:37:49] it's a good sermon right there some
[1:37:50] people are the best salesman in the
[1:37:52] world they're not selling shoes
[1:37:54] they're not selling shirts and clothes
[1:37:57] they're selling excuses and they sell it
[1:37:59] to
[1:38:00] themselves they sell it and then they
[1:38:02] buy they sell it then they bite
[1:38:06] and they buy the excuse of why not to go
[1:38:08] so far with god knowing that that
[1:38:12] secret sin is is a slavery over top of
[1:38:15] their lives and there's a crop coming
[1:38:20] well how do i get rid of the crop sow so
[1:38:24] many good seeds in your life
[1:38:27] until it'll choke out the bad ones
[1:38:32] you're welcome to say amen
[1:38:40] when it comes to elisha
[1:38:43] elisha knows what he's done
[1:38:46] he knows what he's doing
[1:38:49] what he refused
[1:38:52] gahesa has accepted
[1:38:59] there's a cost now
[1:39:01] there's a payday for this
[1:39:05] hazard doesn't realize
[1:39:07] that now i'm going to affect every
[1:39:09] generation of my children
[1:39:15] a little wine won't bother me brother
[1:39:17] ron what about your children
[1:39:20] a little pornography won't bother me but
[1:39:22] what about your children

[1:39:43] music started out in church
[1:39:45] and they sold their gift to the world
[1:39:49] amen
[1:39:51] they sow their gift to the world and so
[1:39:53] the gift laid there in their lives if
[1:39:55] they would have only done the right
[1:39:57] thing with it
[1:39:59] but they sold it to the world it will
[1:40:02] have a payday to it absolutely
[1:40:06] amen
[1:40:13] but they become popular they become gods
[1:40:15] in the world

[1:40:41] enjoy the things that are there
[1:40:44] the god of pigeon forges dolly parton
[1:40:48] she started out in church
[1:40:50] she attributes her uncle to being the
[1:40:53] preacher
[1:40:55] but she watched the ladies of the night
[1:41:00] and wanted to dress like those women
[1:41:04] so she took the gift of a little girl
[1:41:06] don't get mad at me now
[1:41:11] i wish i was preaching to her
[1:41:14] because she might get right with god
[1:41:18] [Applause]
[1:41:28] she projects herself as that little
[1:41:30] country girl
[1:41:31] coming from the church then going to the
[1:41:34] world and selling the music and that's
[1:41:36] an incredible amount of good things
[1:41:38] for children and for the community
[1:41:42] but she won't leave her bedroom without
[1:41:44] her wigs on and her clothes on and all
[1:41:46] of her makeup on because she doesn't
[1:41:49] want nobody to see the real hair

[1:41:54] open thing so i'm just repeating what

[1:42:02] hair but she does
[1:42:04] and come today when her heart quits
[1:42:06] beating

[1:48:32] realize they wasn't doing doing that to
[1:48:34] their children they were doing it to
[1:48:36] their children and their children's
[1:48:38] children and their children's children
[1:48:40] [Applause]
[1:48:56] can you give five more minutes
[1:49:07] naaman
[1:49:10] knew he didn't want to go back to the
[1:49:11] life he used to live
[1:49:14] because the gods that he served
[1:49:17] couldn't heal him
[1:49:21] they couldn't change his habits
[1:49:24] they couldn't take care of the secret
[1:49:25] life
[1:49:27] scripturally
[1:49:28] perfectly points out that
[1:49:31] he was a worshiper of strange gods
[1:49:36] but now he knew
[1:49:38] and it was his confessions
[1:49:41] there's no real god
[1:49:43] in any of the earth
[1:49:46] except for in this land
[1:49:52] come on church
[1:49:54] let me just say this you it had to be a
[1:49:55] sobering thought
[1:49:57] to know that there's no real god
[1:50:00] anywhere in the world except for
[1:50:03] in this elijah anointing
[1:50:08] and i don't want to leave and go back to
[1:50:10] my country to what i used to be
[1:50:12] i got to have this
[1:50:15] i can't live without it
[1:50:17] i'm clean but i don't want to go back to
[1:50:20] worshiping false gods
[1:50:24] listen let me just drop this to you now
[1:50:26] there's many churches in the nominal
[1:50:29] system that had a real revival
[1:50:33] but ichabod is written on the door
[1:50:36] because they refuse this
[1:50:45] i'm sorry i'm far enough away from you i
[1:50:47] won't make you sick
[1:50:56] there's preachers in this valley that
[1:50:58] told their congregations to boycott
[1:51:01] the meetings with brother branham in
[1:51:02] 1958.
[1:51:09] i was walking with brother kelly
[1:51:11] hildebrandt and looking at the hotel
[1:51:14] many years ago
[1:51:17] a hotel that brother branham stayed at
[1:51:20] this time i actually stayed right across
[1:51:22] the road from that hotel
[1:51:25] in a smaller place
[1:51:27] nice place
[1:51:29] just across the road
[1:51:33] i gave a lot of thought of it i sit
[1:51:34] outside and
[1:51:36] and now you're going to get
[1:51:38] part of the next sermon that i preach
[1:51:40] here
[1:51:42] and i sit outside and i and i thought
[1:51:43] about
[1:51:46] the men that told their congregations in
[1:51:48] saskatoon
[1:51:50] whatever you do
[1:51:52] boycott this meeting
[1:51:54] that brother branham is coming to
[1:51:59] they had an auditorium that would seat
[1:52:01] thousands of people
[1:52:05] and 300 people showed up
[1:52:08] 300 people
[1:52:10] brother gunther who was the original
[1:52:13] pastor of brother kelly haldebrandt's
[1:52:14] church that led that church into the
[1:52:17] message
[1:52:18] was one of the men that went to that
[1:52:20] meeting
[1:52:22] and he did it under much pressure
[1:52:25] but he went anyway
[1:52:27] amen
[1:52:28] maybe you will have to do things under
[1:52:30] much pressure to come to this church or
[1:52:34] churches like ours you'll do it under
[1:52:36] much pressure but there's a reward for
[1:52:38] that
[1:52:41] look around at our families
[1:52:44] look around at the blessings
[1:52:47] look around at the children in this
[1:52:49] church
[1:52:50] look around at the women that are
[1:52:52] representatives of what this bible talks
[1:52:54] about as holy royal women
[1:52:59] look at the character of the men
[1:53:04] if you want to do some comparison
[1:53:06] studies look at the character of the men
[1:53:08] and the women and the children that
[1:53:11] listen model citizens
[1:53:14] no we're not a perfect group
[1:53:17] amen but let me just say this to you
[1:53:21] we we literally have a god amongst us
[1:53:24] with miracles and signs and wonders and
[1:53:26] blessings
[1:53:28] because he's here there's incredible
[1:53:30] benefits that goes with it
[1:53:46] i thought about
[1:53:48] what is going to be the cost for those
[1:53:50] men that stood in their pulpit and said
[1:53:52] whatever you do don't go to brother
[1:53:54] bran's meetings
[1:53:56] he's a false prophet
[1:53:59] they
[1:54:00] cursed
[1:54:01] those people
[1:54:04] how did they curse them they blinded
[1:54:06] them from the light
[1:54:17] can i can i just
[1:54:21] and they like to wash their hands of it
[1:54:23] now oh yeah
[1:54:25] we're sorry we're sorry
[1:54:26] we're sorry we're sorry
[1:54:28] there's another man that would like to
[1:54:30] have washed his hands
[1:54:33] and his name was pilate
[1:54:39] and he released unto them barabbas
[1:54:44] what a wonderful sermon the other day on
[1:54:45] i am barabbas amen
[1:54:50] pilate stood there and he didn't want
[1:54:52] the guilt of jesus on him
[1:54:54] so he said bring me a pail of water
[1:54:56] and he stood there and he dipped his
[1:54:58] hands and he washed it and he washed it
[1:54:59] and washed it
[1:55:01] but brother random said
[1:55:03] many times in the in the message
[1:55:06] he can't wash
[1:55:08] jesus off of your hands
[1:55:10] you can't wash jesus off of your hands
[1:55:15] and to just try to wash him off of your
[1:55:17] hands sabotages you

[1:55:28] i sow my soul
[1:55:37] you heard him saying amazing grace it'll
[1:55:38] give you chills
[1:55:41] have you heard him say how great they
[1:55:43] are it'll give you chills
[1:55:44] because he remembered the day when he
[1:55:46] walked in the presence of god
[1:55:48] and now he brings it to an open podium
[1:55:50] across audiences and it brings the
[1:55:52] presence of god down as a haunting
[1:55:55] reminder of you left me

[1:56:49] i'd like to have that dirt i can't live
[1:56:50] with you but i like to have the dirt

[1:57:44] that's for me and my house
[1:57:46] we will serve the living god

[1:58:20] humanity
[1:58:23] i'm sorry
[1:58:25] i'm sorry i can't do a better job
[1:58:27] i apologize
[1:58:32] but i want to talk to you soberly now
[1:58:40] if there's secrecy in your life
[1:58:42] and you know it ain't right
[1:58:46] i'm no prophet
[1:58:48] i'm a gifted man but i'm no prophet
[1:58:54] you know that you know that you know
[1:58:56] there's certain little things you need
[1:58:58] to get rid of
[1:59:00] i don't want you to come to the altar
[1:59:01] now
[1:59:02] i want you to make it right right there
[1:59:03] where you are
[1:59:05] in the secrecy of this place
[1:59:09] you did the sinning
[1:59:11] you do the repenting
[1:59:13] not because you got caught
[1:59:15] because you're truly sorry
[1:59:17] i don't live that way
[1:59:21] look over at your children
[1:59:23] are you costing your children
[1:59:27] [Music]

[2:00:12] because of his stupid bust
[2:00:23] so it don't matter if you're a war hero
[2:00:27] or you sit in the king's palace
[2:00:29] seeing the singing
[2:00:32] you got to deal with it
[2:00:34] not the preacher the preacher only
[2:00:35] brings the message
[2:00:39] [Music]
[2:00:49] maybe you've been worshiping false gods
[2:00:52] god's at rock and roll
[2:00:54] gods of laodicea
[2:00:57] and you've had a so far religion
[2:00:59] convenient religion
[2:01:02] i'm only going to go so far you made it
[2:01:03] up in your mind
[2:01:05] but this sermon has spoken to your heart

[2:01:34] heavenly father
[2:01:37] a god that knows all
[2:01:40] if he knows how many flies are on the
[2:01:42] earth and how many hairs there are ahead
[2:01:46] you know all about us
[2:01:49] you've offered us a blood
[2:01:52] a blood that we wasn't worthy of
[2:01:55] but you've offered us a blood
[2:01:57] to cancel out sin
[2:01:59] and give us an inoculation there's some
[2:02:01] steps that we got to make in our
[2:02:03] humanity
[2:02:04] willing to go to the home pen
[2:02:06] willing to be repent and be baptized in
[2:02:09] the name of the lord jesus christ
[2:02:12] or will we let sin reign over our lives
[2:02:15] for decades
[2:02:17] only to repent on the death bed
[2:02:19] where children will never see
[2:02:22] they'll never know the overcomer
[2:02:26] they just know that god gave the
[2:02:28] man or woman a chance to get right with
[2:02:30] god right before they died
