we've been able to watch several of them and we thank the lord for that and i tell you last night was a miracle i don't know if you got to watch it but dad speaking had blood sugar over 600 throughout the service and then he was able to go through the prayer line the whole time whole time he stayed there the whole time in that prayer line last night that right there alone is a miracle in itself we thank the lord for that this morning amen and they woke up this morning and the sugar was perfect perfect amen that's the kind of god i served this morning amen so good to be in the house of the lord you know it was in a service like that when i was about 16 17 years old i went in one side of a prayer line one man and i came out the other another now what happened in between there i can't explain it i i just i cannot explain it but talk about being a drunk man i became a drunk man instantly but it wasn't on wine it was something that was laid on the inside of there that would keep me hold me and that's what i pray for our children that's what i pray for your children it just thrilled me last night when i was able to see titus walk through that prayer line and i was just saying lord just feel it just feel him lord he could do many things in his life but that right there amen amen you just pray for me this morning as we read the word of life let's turn to psalms 24 this morning psalms 24 and verse 7. and then we will turn over to psalms 10 after that amen say amen when you have it this morning amen psalms 24 and verse 7 lift up your heads o ye gates and be lifted up ye everlasting doors and the king of glory shall come in who is this king of glory the lord strong and mighty the lord mighty in battle lift up your heads o ye gates even lift them up ye everlasting doors and the king of glory shall come in who is this king of glory the lord of hosts he is the king of glory just lift up your gates this morning lift them up in praise and let him come in for he is strong and mighty mighty in battle amen in psalms psalms 110 and verse 1 and the lord said unto my lord sit down at my right hand until i make thine enemies the footstool until i he didn't say you he said until i maketh thine enemies thy footstool so you're going to trod upon your enemies this morning you have already tried upon your enemies this weekend and we claim them things amen let's just go to the lord in prayer dear heavenly father lord we thank you for letting us be able to gather here on this easter morning lord we don't just gather as a just a custom lord but we gather because we have received you within our hearts lord and we're looking for you lord lord we can feel your presence even so near right now lord and lord we ask you that you'll just fill us touch us lord any sick that is in the building lord or listening by the way of internet god i ask you to just move on the scene for him this morning oh god i ask you that you'll just bless the the word that's been read this morning i ask you to just help it just fall upon good ground this morning in jesus name we pray these things amen amen amen you can be seated this morning amen like i said he is the lord mighty in battle this morning so this morning i'd like to speak on when kings go to war when kings go to war he said i will fight your battles i will make thy foes thy footstool i'll put you i'll put them under my feet in a natural realm we we're living in a day where there is war in ukraine when there is war that has been preceded by an evil man a man that he is beginning become old in age and so what old kings seem to do in their older age they want to take more land they want to take possessions and try to do things that they haven't been able to achieve as they get older because their sea they see their day as ending they see their day is coming closer so you hear the drum beat of war you hear it as it's as it begins to pound even here in the u.s now we're not there we're not over there we're not fighting that war but we can feel that war we can feel that pressure that is upon us even people will run to churches when war begins to happen oh russia the prophet spoke of russia maybe this is the time and they'll run to churches but maybe this isn't the war that we're thinking that'll draw us away in a moment of twinkling of eye and soon they'll be gone you won't see those people no more after the war is done and over with it was just something that was just on their flesh and not on their heart so you'll hear hear the drum beats of war and you'll feel them now we see war is mainly waged in the springtime and that is due to health of soldiers because if you're waging it in the wintertime hey it's hard to march thousands and troops and tanks and everything through snow and ice and all this so we see as spring is approaching war is getting nearer or even worse and we've seen that on the natural but also on the spiritual so we see that this this dark age is starting to become more and more and more and we hear that drum beat of war coming closer and closer because satan is trying to do what he can while he has time but he only has a season to work amen i'd like to read this and brother branham says it like this and says finally a man that should have that should never be forgotten as long as there is a switzerland by the name of arnold runwinkler he stepped out in the front of a little army and he said men of switzerland this day i will give my life for switzerland and this day i shall conquer and he said over yonders in the hills is a little white house a sweet loving wife and three children and i told them goodbye i'd be back after a little while but i will never see them again on this earth for i must give my life for switzerland this day and they said arnold van gaal what will you do and he turned towards the oncoming army and he looked over it all and he found the darkest in the midst of spears that there was and he had a stick just imagine that a man like this carrying just a stick to go after his enemies just like shamgar would with an ox goat with a stick satan you didn't bring enough this morning you ain't got enough this morning we got more than a stick with us this morning we got the word of the lord the sword of the spirit with us this morning amen and he threw it down and he said follow me and fight with all you've got with what you have fight with it and he threw away his stick threw out of his hands and he screamed out make way for liberty make way for liberty and he rushed towards the greatest bunch of spears hundred shining spears reached out and he picked them and plunged them and grabbed them into his arms and threw him into his bosom and he screamed out make way for liberty with such a display of heroism it routed it rooted the army and those men that followed there behind them were sticks and clubs and they beat out that army in their land and they never had a war since make way for liberty as he screamed in the darkness of the spears in the darkness of the hour he threw himself into battle and because of his heroism and about to be the conqueror many of years ago in the swell salps and i speak to you today as he ran down i appreciate the mighty arnold von winkler as he says here now this is what i like here of this story here it says and that display of heroism was seldom being compared with one never exchanged but all such a little thing to one day when adam's race had been backed in a corner and god had sent prophets they killed them righteous men and they had stoned them and the devil's oncoming army had atoms raised back into a corner without hope without god without mercy and without anything sicknesses diseases ignorance they were just hopeless there wasn't nothing that could help them but there was one that stepped out of heaven one that stepped out of heaven and he said i must go father and i will give my life for adam's fallen race and he came to the earth and lived for 33 years and he looked it over and he found out where men's greatest fear was and it was death that was at the center of it now watch what he did he ran to calvary he pressed the swords right into his own bosom the swords of death and he sent the holy spirit back to the day of pentecost and by this we are to conquer the world and follow him as our hero of our blessing this morning he conquered death he conquered the greatest fear that was on this earth that was death that would hold you bound o death where is thy sting oh grave where is thy victory oh hallelujah aren't you glad that he conquered death this morning amen he is our mighty conqueror he is our captain that guides us on the ship the stormy life that we must go on walt whitman would write a poem about the civil war and abraham lincoln and it would say all captain all my captain oh our our journey is over our ship has survived the storm and we won the prize that we've been fighting for the port is so close by by now i can hear the bells ringing the people celebrating and all their eyes are on the ship that bold and brave vessel but all my heart my heart my heart oh look the drops of blood on the deck where my captain is laying cold and dead now he was writing this due to abraham lincoln what he achieved through the civil war the battle that was fought there was victory over here but the one that had led them through the battle had fallen dead it seemed all was lost that their conqueror had been conquered but oh we have a captain this morning as the ship's coming into port he's standing there guiding your ship through the rugged seas and has brought you through the wars of life he is the one that is willing to die for you he died for you aren't you glad of that this morning that he died for me a willingness to die we had many men in this in this hour ones that that i can recall on we have brother jackie benton and some of you might even know any of these men but we're here today because of what they stood for what they got at the ship through stormy seas jackie benton as he would come and and he represent and he said there is a messenger to this day there is a messenger to this day henry green that would stand and say i give a little every day because every day i get a little and he'd say go or send someone men that would stand there and that would beckon for the call of christ that would be on your life that would fight for truth that was willing to die for this truth that was willing to give their all for this truth ed biskull that would claim i am a witness i am a witness of what the prophet did i am a witness of what the prophet said i am a living witness of what this word produced george quinn that would have a passion on his heart to get this word to the world dan daisley that would always say all all-inclusive without expectation everyone everyone it's everyone's word but what will you do with it this morning brother joe green that's always claiming i'm looking to spend eternity with you this morning i'm looking to spend eternity with you brother homer frazier that would preach here in this pulpit water baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ he preached it like nobody else i've ever heard it preached before brother murphy wong now i know you don't know some of these men so it's it's not what who you know as brother lorianne sings it's what you know amen brother murphy wong as he had a passion on his heart to get the word to the people hungry people that are willing to die willing to spend their life in prison for this message for this word these are men that have got at the boat through stormy seas men that are conquerors kings of this message kings that i've talked about this morning brother ron spencer as he would call out are you with me nor pain nor death and he'd say never never never never give up never give up amen brother tim pruitt that would continue to preach the people of the book we are people of the book this morning our kings are explaining to us what we are our kings have went to battle for us this morning they went to war for you this morning now you don't know these men but you are sitting here due to what they produced not just something they produced but what the word has produced something that laid on the inside of you from the foundation of the world and these men have searched out through all ages now there's more men that i could say and i could go on what they've preached how that they've brought forth the word but i'm just bringing these this morning is what they did now most of you know them now what they did for you what's been laying on the inside of you they were kings that stood up for you they were kings that went to war for you they fight for you they die for you your children how they've went and they've stayed up in the middle of the nights praying for your sick children your lost loved ones they're kings that have went to war for you this morning they'll still go to war for you if something happens to brother ron brother andrew will go to war for you if something happens to brother andrew i'll go to war for you if something happens brother william we'll all go to war together amen but one of these days we're going to be called away in a moment of the twinkling of an eye amen we're kings we're kings this morning we're queens this morning as brother william was preaching last night we've been sealed we've been given this covenant this morning it's been dovetailed together as he was speaking of the covenant that abraham was putting together that covenant that has been dovetailed together that light that brought together all of the burnt offerings that was sanctified that god said is accepted we've been sealed this morning but not anything we could do it's what god did it's nothing these men of men of god could do it's what he did through them amen so if we have a king our king lord jesus christ he's going to have a kingdom he says in john 14 and 28 29 it says ye have heard now i said unto you i go away and i come again unto you now he's went away he went away to prepare a place but he's coming back but if he's prepared a place there means there is a kingdom and if there is a kingdom there must be a people and if there's a people there must be a bride to rule and reign and to live in this morning he's fighting for you the king has went to war for you this morning there's all kinds of things in the kingdom but before before he had a kingdom he went to war he went to battle and as brother william was speaking last night talking about a choosing place for battle god and satan was choosing a place for a battleground and brother branham says in jesus christ the same yesterday and today and forever it says in the garden of eden satan chose his part of the man satan chose his part of the man that he wanted to do war in his head his intelligence but god took the heart as brother william was speaking last night god took that heart god took that so that even through all of the reasonings that would go on here god could live right here satan would stand behind you i i was praying brother william don't preach at all leave me some as satan would stand behind you and talk to you here and then come over here and talk to and say what a bad person you are but see that's where the devil chose to work at in the reasoning in the intelligence the intelligence the reason the why will well i'm this way and i'm that way you'll never get anywhere with god there but your heart your faith will make you to believe things that your mind knows nothing about and you cast down that reasoning see you must be positive you must stay there until you are positive and then when there is positive there's nothing that can turn you amen when there's positive there is nothing nothing nothing nothing that can turn you this morning because it's here on the heart jesus on the inside he's on the heart this morning for when he chose that battleground he knew how the battle how the battle would lay he knew the ground he done proved it he said this ground it's going to be perfect because i'm going to whip that devil anytime any place anywhere when he's laying on the inside of your heart amen this morning i'd like to turn over into genesis 14 and we're speaking on when kings go to battle when kings go to war so we see how abram and lot had chose their place after they had separated see lot he pitched his tent towards sodom he said that's where i want to be because it looked good to lot it looked beautiful rivers plains it was so beautiful and abram let lot choose first he said you choose you go let there be no strife between me and thee so he chose his place he chose sodom but abram chose to stay in memory but now abram after a lot had been separated from him god blessed him he blessed him after he was separated from lot that was lot's first black sliding was where he chose to go towards sodom what what he chose to look for that was beautiful that was good amen and here in this hour we've got many that choose to look for something that's beautiful a well-spoken mannered preacher not someone rough and ruggedy but that's don't that's not what you need god will bless you let them go on so i'd like to read here over in genesis 14 and you just bear with me this morning if i call if i don't have a cold i don't know the names amen hallelujah amen and it came to pass in the days of hammerfell king of shinar arnot king of elazar ketterleam king of elm and title king of nations that these made war with beer a king of sodom and beershaw king of gomorrah sinab king of atma and she member king of zoboyum and king of bilah which was zoar hallelujah got through that part of the scriptures amen so these kings were preparing for war and these were joined together in the veil of sidom which is the salt sea twelve years they served killer limb in the 13th year now they rebelled so we see abram has been in memory for about 13 years and these kings now are preparing to go to war near sodom and all those that are around sodom and ketterlae and in the fourteenth year came catalina the king and the kings that were with them and smote the wrathiums the asteroths of cartham and the zuzim's ham and the eminem's of shaven cartham and the horror nights and their an amount of seerah and el porn which is by the wilderness and they were turned and came at miss pad which is kadesh and they smote all the in the country of the amalekites and also the amorites that dwell in hazon tamar and there went out the king of sodom the king of gomorrah and the king of atmos the king of zuboyum the king of billah which is saint zaar and they joined battle and they came in the veil of sidom with ketterleam the king of elm with title king of nations and amraphel king of shinar and arnot king of elazar four kings with five four kings with five now satan you know better than bringing too little once again amen and the veil of sidom was full of slime pits and the kings of sodom and gomorrah fled and there and remained and fled to the mountain so now solomon gomorrah where lot has been has been overthrown by these kings of catalan and they took all the goods of sodom and gomorrah and their rituals and went their way and they took a lot abram's brother's son and dwelt in solemn who dwelt in sodom his goods and departed and there came one that had escaped and told abram the hebrew for he dwelt in the plain of memory the amorite brother of ishkul brother of anar and these were confederate with abram and when abram heard that his brother was taken captive he armed his trained servants born in his own house 318 and pursued them unto dan and he divided himself against he and his servants by night and smoked them and pursued them even unto hubba which is left hand of damascus and he brought back all the goods and also brought again his brother lot and his goods and the women also and the people now we see abram they didn't call abram the king he he wasn't the king but see all those people here that had went to battle were called kings but they called abram the hebrew i'd rather be called the hebrew i'd rather be called the christian this morning i'd rather be called that than a king of a world that will fall and so abram took and he went after lot and he conquered there that stupid devil why in the world do you think that you could take one of ours why do you think that you could come in and steal our joy still our peace still our children there's kings that are here this morning that is willing to fight for you they'd go to the end of the world for you and that's what abram did he said you done messed up he he went there and they they caused them to fall in the slime pits but abram went and he conquered abram conquered there and he took back all but i want you to see what what he did when he brought it all back now he done conquered all those kings that had went together and defeated all of sodom and gomorrah and he brought back he brought it back all the goods and also bring again his brother lot and his goods and the women and also the people and the king of sodom went out to meet him and he didn't go down with abram to help him fight this battle he said no we don't been whooped i don't want to be associated with you but he did once he seen abram coming back with all the goods all the men and women all all the cattle everything he said hey we'll make a pack here maybe let's do something here and the king of sodom went to meet him after returning from the slaughter of ketterleam and the kings that were with him in the valley of shaven which was the king's dale and melchizedek king of salem brought forth bread and wine and he was the priest of the most high god he is our ilion this morning he is our high priest the most high god our mechizedek this morning has come to bless you and he blessed him and said said blessed be abram the most high god possessor of heaven and earth possessor possessor of heaven and earth amen blessed be the most high god which hath delivered thine enemies into the unhand and gave and abram then gave ties of all he get ties of all right away right away given ties to all of what he had conquered there but the king of sodom said unto abram give me the persons give me the persons and and maybe you take the goods i just want the persons and abram said to the king of sodom i've lifted up my hand unto the lord the most high god the possessor of heaven and earth that i will not take from the thread even the shulaishi that i will not take anything that is thine lest thou should have say i have made abram rich see he knew what the king of sodom would have done he just said abram's not blessed i made him rich you're not blessed i've made you rich oh no he said not a chance sodom not a chance he said take it all you just just take it all all back but look look what lot did he had already been brought out of that war he had been held captive and abram went and got him saved him but he went right back into sodom right back from where abram had unsaved him from now why in the thunder would you want to go back to what you've been saved from why there ain't nothing there to go back for nothing amen but look what happens after all of this the lord comes and blesses abram even more even more than he had before he had blessed him when he was in memory he had blessed him there no war no nothing had come against abram but he said i'm going to bless you he says fear not i am thy shield and thy exceedingly exceedingly great reward this morning and he blessed him he made a covenant with abraham for blessed is going to be yours you're going to be kings and priests you're going to have loins that'll come out that are kings and priests blessed are you so we see how how now abraham is even blessed even more and he said i'm going to bless you i'm going to bless sarah but see they they took things into their own hands there for a little bit and they produced ishmael through hagar but god god came back down to him god came down to him years later now he's still in memory he's he's still there and a lot is still in sodom now he said i'm going to bless you so he come by one day melchizedek most high god three angels come by there and abram ran to the tent door and said oh my lord my god oh you've stopped by my way won't you just won't you just come in and just dwell with me for a little bit this morning it's it's been a while i'm getting old stricken in aging and i'm just not seeing what you might have said there but but maybe just we'll fix you a cake just feast with us here for a little bit now he blessed him and he had a name change at that point aren't you glad you've had a name change here this morning i was a sinner but now god's changed me i'm his bride this morning and so so we see how those three that had come to bless abram here but they didn't just stay there they said we have more work to do there's still somebody down there in sodom that we're going to try to bring them on out so they walked a little while with abraham and and abraham asked him what will they do he said we're going to destroy it we said what what if there's what if there's 50 would you save it i'll spare it well what if there's 40 i'll save it i'll spare it what if first but it got all the way down will you save it we save it if there's 10 or so i said i'll say it i'll save it so the most high walked on with abram and the two angels went down to sodom to preach them there for a little bit but sodom was so wicked so defile that the people of sodom seen the two men coming in and they went to lot and said the two men that are that are in your house bring them out we're living in a filthy age filthy age but it's got to get as bad as it was in sodom filthy that people will want to pervert with two angels but that's what the world wants to do today they don't want to hear none of this they want to pervert the word that's how filthy we're starting to become in this age it's it's becoming filth they fornicated with the word and they put off everything that they don't want they said lot prepare your household we're going to destroy it oh don't don't don't don't don't we're doing it we're going to destroy it lot even had offered his virgin daughters his virgin daughters in his house how perverted had lot even gotten how wicked had lot even gotten that he would offer his virgin daughters to the filth of the city don't take the angels you take my virgin daughters what type of filth was he living in we've been called to step out of that they said let's go so in the morning they they rose and lot still did not want to go but the angels even took and grabbed hold of lot by the hand and he pulled them pulled his house out of sodom now this is the second time that lot has been pulled out of a war out of a filth out of a battle out of captivity the second time that lot has been there but the filth had become so bad that his wife wanted to turn back and she turned back towards sodom and turned into a pillar of salt and lot said what shall i do they said go up here this is where you're going to be safe and he said well i don't want to go up there i want to go down here in zore i want to stay down here because it's in the plains and the angels okay then go then you go then okay we we won't destroy it but god remembered his his covenant with abraham he remembered his covenant he said we're still going to destroy zoroar so lot had to flee to the mountains with his two daughters now but the filth that was still there they never got rid of that backslidden condition they stayed where they was at in that backslidden condition but they thought that they were still okay but the two daughters the two virgin daughters that he had taken out they committed adultery even with lot and said we must have children we must so they got a lot drunken now this was the last straw for lot this was the last time for lot he had done backslid so much filth no more lot did everything he could to stay in that field did everything he could he pressed his way towards that but i want you to see those two daughters produced moab and i can't think of the name of the other one help me out okay moab i wrote it down here somewhere y'all bear with me abhim lami is that right i've been lami i've been allami they produced those two moab and a bin lobby and i'm not saying that right i know through their wickedness they produce those two and we go on to read how bad moab and all them was how bad that the filth had contaminated even the seed that they would even have and how awful that they would be the moabites how they'd offer sacrifices of little girls from a young age the filth that they were living in amen see we we've got to compel compel them to come to the house of the lord this morning tell them don't wait don't wait until it's too late compel them to come we don't want a bunch of just religious fanatics that are alexander scroby that can open up the scriptures or close them and they can read it front to back put a pencil through the pages and they can read everywhere the pencil touched we don't want all of that we want sons and daughters of god that will serve the lord jesus christ no matter what comes no matter what goes amen compel them to come brother brother branham would say in the souls now in prison our christ he would go down there to souls now in prison on resurrection day and he had done taking the keys off of satan's side he said give them to me big boy i'm taking over i'm taking over and you see abraham and sarah as he's walking down through there knocks on the door sarah says who is it who is it if it's that old satan please don't open that door again he's beat me so long i'm tired of living down in here because see they were trapped there souls now in prison were trapped there because they were under the old law under the the blood of blood of sheeps and goats but now jesus christ had shed his blood for morning jesus christ had made the way took every every day a devil in hell knocked on the door abraham oh honey that's the one that met me in the tent door that day that's the one right there he's the one that saved us and he took them made some pit stops over through there took all the old prophets and said come on come on ezekiel said that's him i saw on the way up and the high in the middle of the wheel amen job seen him and said whoa i know my redeemer lives this morning amen see he took those souls that were now in prison and you might feel this morning i'm in prison i've been locked up but he has already paid the price just accept it this morning just step out on his word and accept it this morning don't be locked up in chains the chains that are holding you down they've been unshackled just shake off those chains just shake them off amen so we see how moab and the moabites were created and how lot fought his way over the blood of christ to sin he fought his way over the blood over the covenant every he fought his way as hard as he could to sin but there was something that was laying on the inside that god said i have a seed even through all of that filth i have a seed there and ruth come out of that moabites ruth come out of the moabites so we see see a man that has fought his way over the blood over the blood of christ did everything under the sun to get away from it but his his lineage there was one that said oh oh trust me not to go where you go i shall go she fought her way back over that blood to christ and said i will live where you live i will die where you your god will be my god what will you fight for this morning what will you fight for i enjoy your fight this morning be kings and priests he has promised you you are royal priesthood you are our chosen generation you are kings and priests this morning you fight there you stay there don't let the devil reason with you up here let jesus come in your heart this morning amen all the redemption the redemption that roof gave all the mercy that god gives and there's still people that will trod over the blood of christ to sin you have to trod over that blood those two types and there and you will see you will have people that do you do you see it can can you see it look look here i know you can see it it's the same you you speak better than i speak i know you see it no i just can't see it or maybe they think they see it and then they live it for a little while no you know what this whole world it's pleasurable it is pleasurable for a season sin is pleasurable for a season amen but see we're chosen generation we are a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people aren't you glad that you can be part of a peculiar people this morning a bunch of weirdos here upon four gospel lighthouse sure you're peculiar aren't you want to go to church on easter morning don't you know your ham's it's overcooked if he goes any longer that's going to ruin my mac and cheese hallelujah i'm glad to be part of that peculiar people amen amen he's given you weapons on every side he's given you all type of weapons he's ordained you to fulfill the last scriptures he's ordained you to be runners in this race amen hallelujah let's just turn over to second kings 3. don't you love him this morning aren't you glad that god fights for you he fights your battles for you takes away this old sin nature takes a way that would hold you down the darkness that would creep in on your life so here we see what the moabites had produced in chapter 3 and verse 4 in the king of moab mission and he was a sheep master and rendered to the king of israel a hundred thousand lambs and a hundred thousand rams with the wool but it came to pass when ahab was dead king of moab rebelled against the king of israel and the king of jeremiah went to samaria at the same time and numbered all of israel and it went out and sent to jehoshaphat king of judah saying the king of moab hath rebelled against me will thou go with me against moab to battle and he said i will go up i am as thou art my people as thy people and my horses as thy horses and he said which way shall we go up and he answered the way through the wilderness of edom and the king of israel went to the king of judah and the king of edom and they fetched a compass of seven days journey and there was no water for the host or for the cattle that followed them and the king of israel said alas the lord hath called these three kings together to deliver them into the king and to the hand of moab but watch here they're they're all wowzy wowsy wu we we've went into this battle we are unprepared we're not we're going to die we're going to die in this battle but watch what jehoshaphat said he said but jehoshaphat said is there not a prophet of the lord now he's starting to have a reputation for himself because he asked this before and they sent forth micah and and the king there said oh there is a man but he don't like me he tells me the truth but it's not what i want to hear so so jehoshaphat is now looking for another prophet in the land because hey that worked out pretty good that time not really didn't listen to him maybe i'll listen okay all right so there's a prophet is there a prophet of the lord in the land that we may inquire of the lord by him and the one king of israel's servants now his servant not the king the servant answered and said here is elisha the son of jacques which poured water on the hands of elijah and jehoshaphat said the word of the lord is with him so the king of israel and jehoshaphat and the king of edom went down to him and elisha said unto the king of israel what have i to do with thee elisha's talking to these kings now have come to ask his wisdom what have i to do with thee get thee back to the prophets of thy father and the prophets of thy mother and the king of israel said nay lord have called these three kings together to deliver them unto the hand of moab now you see here elisha said go back to your mom and daddy's teachings you that's what you've held held on the whole time just go back to that it it ain't going to help you none but going back to it why why do people call you on the phone in the middle of the night and go i'm just going to use this for an example brother ron this is rupert and uh and my cousin's aunt uh sister brother son and i can't recall his name i'll have to call him back but they're sick gets out of bed mom goes who who's that rupert somebody's sick well who is it i didn't catch a name they didn't know the name well why they want you to pray for them well they know that what we have they ain't got but come on now so what's going to do i'm going to pray for him that's what that's what i do i pray for him and then you get a testimony hey hey this is roop they're they're healed they're healed awesome are they gonna come to church you asking way too much for that oh oh they don't know we just want to heal him we didn't want to save him but he living a good life something might happen to the cars the horses the houses everything else they live in a good light well we see what you all go through brother ron got cancer y'all lose everything every now and then but hey you know no we don't want none of that we just want you to help us out when we really need you don't that just burn you up about a flame about that high and you wonder did you even pray for them did did you get on your knees and did you pray for them see i've done told you this morning you are kings and priests you are a chosen generation you're more than able i will make thy fools yeah those two thy footstool so won't you claim it won't you pray for him this morning amen so we see here that they jehoshaphat don't come to elisha we need you hey we know the lord's with you this he said you know what i do it i do it somebody bring me but before i go to prayer i got to do some rejoicing he said bring me a minstrel bring me a musical instrument i'm going to do some praising before the lord of god comes down put up psalms 150 for me this morning because i'm going to praise him this morning oh yes he says i'm going to praise him amen psalms 150 because i want you all to read it together because if you read it it becomes on the tablets of your heart do some praising this morning says praise ye the lord praise god in his sanctuary praise him in the firmament of his power praise him for his mighty acts mighty acts praise him according to his excellent greatness praise him with the sound of the trumpet praise him with the sorcery and the heart praise him with the timbrel and the dance praise him with the string instruments no organs praise him upon the loud sounding symbols praise him upon the high sounding symbols come on now now what's this say what's that say let everything everything have breath praise ye the lord well elisha said i'm gonna do some praising because i know what brings the power of god on the scene praise ye the lord let everything to have breath praise ye the lord this morning amen praise him praise him for his mighty acts praise him for his excellent greatness let everything to happen praise ye the lord hallelujah hallelujah we serve an awesome god this morning so we praise him and elijah said now that i've done some praising the lord has said this is what you're going to do he said i want you to dig ditches oh we don't work we just want the miracles no get to digging ditches he said you dig them ditches and you keep on digging them ditches brother brian would say when those digging the ditches if you hit a tin can throw it out keep on digging them ditches keep on digging in that word that's what elisha told them to do you get to digging you get to digging in that well what happens is is when you get to digging you dig down here and before a little bit it starts to raise and you can't see you no more because you've done dogs so deep that you can't see you so so this word that was down here you really didn't understand you've done you've done you've done dug so deep that hallelujah it's over and it is covering you it's covering you this morning those ditches that you're digging it might it might seem so stony so rock so hard it might be you're probably digging up on pine creek lane or miscellaneous laying there where it's nothing but stones and and you just keep on digging i wish i could use a post-hole digger right now but every time you go you all know what a phd is it's not it's not education it's a post hole digger hey man you don't need no phd you need a post hole digger amen so so you get to digging and throwing out all them rocks you're throwing out the tin cans and you're throwing out old logs that would get in your way that would try to dam up the water that would come freely from the thrones of glory and just say get on out of here i'm gonna i'm gonna keep on digging because that's what elisha said for me to do and i'm gonna just keep on digging in the word and no matter who comes or what goes i'm gonna dig cause that's what he told me to do amen so we gotta dig in the word we gotta just come before him i love that don't you just just digging in the word until you can't see me no more and all you see is him amen hallelujah it's been good this morning isn't it amen i've enjoyed myself i don't know about any of y'all i've enjoyed it amen now i want you to look what happened after they dug the ditches the water that was dammed up in their life the water that was not flowing it flowed the wind the water and all came and the ditches was full so you dig those ditches to let the water come in let that water just flow through through you and you see the the moabite kings come out that morning rose up and said they've come up against us but we're going to win and they kind of looked over the valley and they looked they said well those those ditches they dug are full the ditches that brother jason had dug in the word it's full well the ones in the back said what what's it full of well the sun was rising up early that morning they said it's full of blood that's the king's that's king's blood our kings have fallen our kings have fallen that's our king's blood they have done dug so many ditches and they've done killed them all the the blood the blood has run through the ditches it's the blood it's the blood it shall pass what can wash away my sins nothing but the blood of jesus it's that blood this morning it's that blood that jesus shed on the cross and they were conquered right then and there due to them seeing that blood so what should you do this morning dig your ditches get to digging in the word it's not going to be easy it's not going to just like i had to study to read those names i have you have to study you have to get into the word i'm not expecting to be some theologian and be able to just speak beautifully but hey just get behind the word and amen and say i've dug the ditches now lord you just come and you overflow and you fill me up like you've never felt me before let the blood cover me to where no sin can be seen they're cast in the sea of god's forgetfulness that's good enough for me amen and so we see over in luke let's turn to luke 23. i'm going to bring this to a close here shortly amen maybe musicians can start to hit this way here this morning 23 luke 23 and verse 33 they said and when they were come to the place which is called calvary they crucified him and the male factors one on the right and one on the left and then jesus said father forgive them for they know not what they do and they parted the raiments and cast lots and the people stood beholding and the people stood beholding and the rulers also with them declared him saying he saved others let him save himself if he be the christ of the chosen as he's he's there hanging on the cross forgiving them for all their sins forgive them for the not what they do there were men playing games below the cross casting lots don't be playing games this morning don't don't just play games in this this time we have a king that has went to war for you don't just be sitting around playing games and then there was rulers standing beholding him there were priests there they wanted religion but they didn't want the deity of christ they said if you be what god said you was save yourself but i want you to notice it says the one male factor said indeed justly for we receive our due reward we we get what's coming to us right now but this man jesus has done nothing miss and he said unto jesus lord remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom and jesus said verily verily i say unto you today shall thou be with me in paradise today it didn't take forever it didn't take years and years and years in a little moment he said today will you be with me in paradise oh i can't wait to be in his kingdom as i've preached to you this morning that our kings have went to war our kings died for us our king has risen he's alive this morning aren't you glad that he's alive amen when he rose up from the grave and here come
