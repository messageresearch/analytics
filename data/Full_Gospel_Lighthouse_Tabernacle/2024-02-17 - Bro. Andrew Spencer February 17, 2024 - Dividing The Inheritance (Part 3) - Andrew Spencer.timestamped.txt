[38:58] receive correction Lord Jesus and the
[39:01] greatest correction that there is is
[39:03] love father and Lord we humble ourselves
[39:06] before you and Lord we want to be ready
[39:09] Lord for your your coming you're soon
[39:11] approaching Lord and you see every hand
[39:14] that was lifted up Lord I pray that you
[39:16] would be God to them today Lord we're
[39:19] your children and we love you and we
[39:21] humble ourselves before you this weekend
[39:23] and ask God you'd speak to us lip to ear
[39:26] in the name of Jesus Christ we pray
[39:28] these things amen and amen if you have
[39:31] your Bibles this evening we'd like to
[39:33] look over into a few portions of
[39:35] scripture into Joshua chapter 1 and
[39:38] verse
[39:41] three now to Ephesians chapter 1 and
[39:45] Hebrews chapter 6 as
[39:48] well
[39:51] amen Joshua chapter 1 Ephesians chapter
[39:54] 1 and then Hebrews chapter 6 and I'll
[39:57] I'll give you the verses as we turn
[39:59] there that way you don't have to Fumble
[40:02] through there and try to find it all at
[40:03] one time I know that I know that us
[40:06] ministers sometime can put a whole lot
[40:08] on your plate just all at one time but
[40:10] I'll give I'll give you space so amen do
[40:13] you love the Lord tonight amen amen
[40:18] isn't he so good to us to let us come
[40:20] back and to enter in like David would
[40:22] say I was glad when they said unto me
[40:24] let us go to the house of the Lord I'd
[40:27] say that's me that's me amen Joshua
[40:30] chapter 1 and verse three and the Bible
[40:32] said that every place that the soul of
[40:35] your foot shall tread upon that have I
[40:38] given unto you as I said unto Moses it's
[40:41] a powerful thing when somebody gives you
[40:44] a gift but it's even more powerful in
[40:48] the one that has given it to him it
[40:50] really matters who's giv it to you and
[40:53] God is saying that I have given it unto
[40:55] you as I said un Moses from the
[40:57] Wilderness and this Lebanon even under
[40:59] the Great River of the river Euphrates
[41:01] and all the land of the Hittites under
[41:03] the great sea towards the going down of
[41:05] the sun shall be your Coast so God has
[41:07] given Joshua a map he's given him a map
[41:11] of all of his inheritance said there
[41:13] shall not any man be able to stand
[41:15] before thee all the days of thy life as
[41:17] I was with Moses so I will be with thee
[41:19] I will not fail thee nor forsake thee be
[41:22] strong and of a good courage For unto
[41:25] this people shalt thou divide for an
[41:27] inheritance the land which I swear unto
[41:30] their fathers to give them Ephesians
[41:33] chapter 1 and verse
[41:36] three Ephesians chapter 1 and verse
[41:39] three and we understand that Ephesians
[41:42] and Joshua parallel one another you can
[41:44] run them side by side and you can see
[41:46] perfectly the alignment of how the
[41:49] inheritance is lined out here and notice
[41:52] what Paul says in verse three blessed be
[41:55] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus
[41:57] Christ who hath blessed us with all
[41:59] spiritual blessings in Heavenly places
[42:02] according as he hath chosen Us in him
[42:05] before the foundation of the world that
[42:07] we should be holy and Without Blame
[42:09] before him in love having predestinated
[42:12] us under the adoption of children by
[42:14] Jesus Christ to himself according to the
[42:17] good pleasure of his will also Hebrews
[42:20] chapter 6 and verse
[42:25] 16
[42:33] amen Paul writes here to the letter to
[42:36] the Hebrews in verse 16 says for men
[42:38] verely swear by the greater and oath for
[42:42] confirmation is to them an end of all
[42:44] Strife that's when you got two parties
[42:46] that are are at a complete variance
[42:48] against one one another and when they
[42:51] when they bring an oath together they
[42:53] bind themselves or adhere themselves to
[42:55] the terms
[42:56] of the contract or the agreement so so
[42:59] this an oath is a confirmation is to
[43:02] them it's the end of all Strife that is
[43:04] laying right there in the confirmation
[43:07] of that oath that is made wherein God
[43:09] willing more abundantly to show unto the
[43:12] hirs of Promise the ubility of his
[43:15] counsel confirmed it by an oath there
[43:19] that by two immutable things in which it
[43:21] was impossible for God to lie that we
[43:24] might have a strong
[43:26] consolation who have fled for Refuge to
[43:29] lay hold upon the hope that is set
[43:32] before us may God bless his word you may
[43:34] be seated here tonight in the presence
[43:37] of the Lord by the help of the Lord we'd
[43:39] like to continue our thought that we've
[43:41] been speaking to you the last few
[43:43] weekends on dividing dividing The
[43:46] Inheritance just to just kind of review
[43:48] just a little bit where we've been the
[43:50] last few weekends we remember that all
[43:52] the way back there in Genesis chapter 15
[43:55] that God had spoke a word to Abram that
[43:57] his seed was going to go in there and
[44:00] they were going to inherit a land that
[44:02] God had promised this before Abraham
[44:05] even had a seed that was in his natural
[44:08] flesh and God God told him that that
[44:11] your seed is going to go in there and
[44:13] they're going to possess that land and
[44:15] there we found out that that God had a
[44:18] predestinated people that was placed
[44:20] there by the very inspiration of their
[44:23] birth that their mother that even in
[44:25] their birth their mother mother what by
[44:26] calling their name would place them
[44:29] right there in their position in the
[44:31] kingdom of God or in the in the very
[44:33] Land Of The Inheritance and that no one
[44:36] could take their inheritance there was
[44:38] nobody that could rightfully lay claim
[44:41] upon what they had that God had said
[44:44] that was rightfully theirs and that's
[44:45] why naboth knew that when when Ahab came
[44:48] to come and to take his Vineyard he came
[44:51] in there and he wanted it and even
[44:52] though Ahab outranked nabbo in position
[44:55] or in position in the land naboth
[44:58] rightfully knew that it was his because
[45:00] it had passed down by The Inheritance
[45:03] that it was rightfully his and there
[45:05] naboth could stand there and say it's
[45:07] not for you Ahab this is my inheritance
[45:10] so naboth could stand there even though
[45:12] a king could threaten him and and and
[45:14] Jezebel would come in and later on take
[45:16] his life but yet naboth had every right
[45:18] to stand there and say that this is my
[45:21] rightful inheritance and it doesn't
[45:23] matter who outranks you or what status
[45:26] is in this life it doesn't matter what
[45:29] they come or who says that you can't
[45:30] have it you know that by a seed of God
[45:33] that God has given you these things
[45:36] therefore you can perfectly align
[45:37] Yourself by the word of God and you can
[45:40] say that I have every right to stay here
[45:43] and I believe that's the same thing that
[45:44] the Holy Ghost is doing today is that
[45:47] he's hunting out honest hearts that are
[45:49] wanting to believe the message that's
[45:51] that's that's within them everything
[45:53] that's within them that's what the Holy
[45:55] Ghost is doing he's hunting out somebody
[45:57] that's that's willing to lay it all down
[45:59] there on the line and say I believe this
[46:01] with all of my heart and you go back and
[46:04] you begin to study out the message and
[46:06] you begin to look at Abraham's life that
[46:08] the prophet would say that God had been
[46:10] testing Abraham or the patriarch he had
[46:13] be he had been testing the patriarch
[46:15] because he gave him a promise and when
[46:17] God makes a promise he wants to be sure
[46:20] he wants to be sure that this person is
[46:22] worthy of the promise before he fulfills
[46:26] what he said that he was going to do or
[46:27] what he promises so he wants to make
[46:29] sure that the person is worthy enough
[46:32] for the promise before he goes in there
[46:34] so God was testing the patriarch Abraham
[46:37] to see whether he really believed him or
[46:39] not that's the way brother Brandon would
[46:41] tell us about the baptism of the Holy
[46:43] Ghost is that when God gives you the
[46:45] Holy Ghost it's a sign unto you that God
[46:48] has accepted your faith that God has
[46:51] accepted your faith so he gives you the
[46:53] very baptism or the very Zo life that
[46:56] God accept your faith and I think it's
[46:59] amazing thing tonight that you can
[47:01] identify that you have the baptism of
[47:03] the Holy Ghost that God has accepted
[47:05] your faith now if God has accepted your
[47:08] faith for the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[47:10] how much more will he accept your faith
[47:12] for deliverance or for your breakthrough
[47:14] or for your healing or for or for the
[47:17] things that you need in your natural
[47:19] life so if God accepted your faith
[47:21] Hallelujah if God accepted your faith
[47:24] and he give you the baptism of the Holy
[47:26] Ghost as a seal upon your life that you
[47:29] are mine and I am
[47:32] yours it's the same way with Mary when
[47:35] God found a Virgin Mary that perfectly
[47:37] aligned herself with what Isaiah had
[47:40] said about her she was perfectly in line
[47:43] see God had found somebody that was
[47:46] worthy that was worthy to be able to
[47:49] accept what God had already said in
[47:51] there so you could see that there was
[47:52] going to be a virgin son after the fact
[47:55] but God had a virgin in a woman that was
[47:58] going to match the very promise that God
[48:01] already had laid out there and that's
[48:04] the same way with the body of Jesus
[48:05] Christ you are the perfect match piece
[48:08] of the promises of God so therefore God
[48:11] can say that I have found somebody that
[48:14] is worthy enough to carry my name
[48:17] somebody that's worthy enough to operate
[48:19] in my name Hallelujah so therefore holy
[48:22] trust you with his promises yeah now
[48:27] brother random comes in in 1962 and he
[48:29] preaches a very powerful message on
[48:32] confirmation and evidence and in there
[48:35] brother Brandon would tell us about a
[48:36] man or he would talk talk to us there
[48:38] and he said now when a man buys a car
[48:41] when a man buys a car he he's got to
[48:43] have a deed to that car and he said even
[48:45] though he doesn't have that car sitting
[48:47] out there in his garage he know that
[48:49] he's got he knows that he's got a car
[48:51] it's because he's got a DE to that car
[48:54] is that right because he's got that deed
[48:56] it's just like if you would go out and
[48:58] you'd buy yourself a piece of property
[49:00] you know whether you see that property
[49:02] or not you know that you've got that
[49:04] property because you have a title deed
[49:06] in your hand even though you've never
[49:08] seen the land you got an abstract title
[49:11] deed to that land and maybe maybe it's
[49:14] several hundred miles I know that I've
[49:16] got it I've not walked out upon it yet
[49:19] but I know that it's rightfully mine why
[49:22] do I know it it's because I have the
[49:24] abstract title deed right here in my
[49:27] hand so I can say I have this property
[49:30] now there might be somebody out there on
[49:32] that property and the only way that you
[49:34] can rightfully kick them off of that
[49:36] property is to take them back to the
[49:39] abstract and say this is rightfully
[49:42] mine and you can say that it personally
[49:45] belongs to you you see that's what the
[49:48] abstract is it tells us that that is our
[49:52] property that's what the Holy Ghost is
[49:54] to you it's to you that that's that's
[49:56] filled with the Holy Ghost that abstract
[49:59] in your life perfectly lines everything
[50:01] up in your life and say that's for you
[50:04] that's for me that's why you can stand
[50:06] there say I can have more of God it's
[50:09] because it's in the abstract you can
[50:11] stand there and say I can have Miracles
[50:13] because it's in the abstract I can have
[50:16] deliverances because it's in the
[50:19] abstract I don't believe that we ought
[50:21] to operate outside of our abstract but
[50:23] if it's right there laying in our
[50:25] inheritance then we ought to operate at
[50:28] full
[50:30] capacity is that right you see even
[50:33] though the children of Israel even
[50:36] though they were down there in Egypt and
[50:37] they were living in a land that wasn't
[50:39] their own they could still say that I am
[50:41] the Seed of
[50:43] Abraham that's why Joseph and Jacob
[50:46] would spend all of those years telling
[50:48] them don't you leave my bones down here
[50:50] I know who I am I'm not living in my
[50:53] rightful land but I know who I am
[50:56] I know where I'm living at and the land
[50:59] to the Israelites to think about it just
[51:01] to put it into play for you just for a
[51:03] moment that the land to the Israelites
[51:05] was completely invisible to
[51:08] them it was completely invisible to them
[51:11] while they were living down there in
[51:12] Egypt and even though they were down
[51:14] there in Egypt and they were living in a
[51:16] land that wasn't their own they could
[51:18] simply say that's my land out there
[51:21] right they never saw that Land one time
[51:24] while they was down there in Egypt but
[51:26] they had a promise out there that was
[51:28] saying that it was for them but they
[51:30] only had it by word right and there is a
[51:34] lot of times where Satan will beat you
[51:37] up is because you only have it in word
[51:39] form it's just like when they when the
[51:42] when Moses would prophesy in Deuteronomy
[51:44] 8 and5 that the Lord Our God would raise
[51:47] up a prophet like un to myself they had
[51:50] it in word form but when Jesus stood
[51:53] there when he stood there it was no
[51:56] longer what was in Prophecy but the
[51:59] reality was standing there now let me
[52:02] say it like this what promises don't
[52:05] really scare
[52:06] Satan but the reality is what scares
[52:10] Satan you can talk about a bride coming
[52:13] and it don't scare Satan but the reality
[52:16] of it the manifestation of it that's
[52:19] what scar
[52:20] Satan that's what scar Satan you see
[52:24] they only had it in word form they were
[52:27] looking at it by promise you see there's
[52:29] a lot of things that you can align your
[52:32] faith with and you could say that it's a
[52:33] promise of God you can sit there and you
[52:36] can line it up and say I believe that I
[52:38] believe that and you can confess it
[52:40] until you're bleue in the face but until
[52:42] it becomes a living reality to you it's
[52:45] doing you absolutely no maybe we would
[52:47] say no good in that aspect but when you
[52:50] possess it when you and the promise
[52:54] become one you see they could sit there
[52:57] and guess that John the Baptist was the
[52:59] Messiah they could look at it but when
[53:02] Jesus stood there and the Bible said in
[53:04] John 1:4 that the word was made flesh
[53:08] and dwelt Among Us you could say that
[53:11] they looked back there in the land of
[53:13] Egypt and they said they had a Promised
[53:15] Land but when the word was made flesh at
[53:17] them when they looked over Jordan and
[53:21] they begin to see all of the promises
[53:23] that was laying out there they could no
[53:26] longer
[53:27] deny Satan could no longer deny that
[53:30] they were looking at that
[53:33] reality you see life only comes by the
[53:36] word of God is that right life only
[53:39] comes by the word of God but as long as
[53:41] it's in this book then it can be
[53:43] questioned it can still be questioned as
[53:45] long as it's laying right there in that
[53:47] book but when it's made
[53:49] manifest but when it's made manifest you
[53:52] see somebody could speak a word over top
[53:55] of of you and it could just simply be a
[53:57] word but when it becomes a
[53:59] reality when your life matches up with
[54:03] what the word says then it's no longer
[54:06] just a
[54:09] promise that's why Satan has a real
[54:12] problem with the bride of Jesus Christ
[54:14] it's because she's not just word only
[54:17] but she's
[54:19] [Applause]
[54:21] spirit is that right is that right
[54:25] so then you're no longer looking at just
[54:27] the promise but you're looking at the
[54:29] physical manifestation or the product of
[54:32] what was spoken back there in the
[54:33] beginning now Paul said in 2 Corinthians
[54:37] 4:18 that while we look not at the
[54:39] things which are seen But at the things
[54:41] which are not seen for the things which
[54:43] are seen are temporal but the things
[54:46] which are not
[54:48] seen let's say that together the things
[54:50] that are not
[54:52] seen the things that are not seen are
[54:57] Eternal the things that you don't see
[55:00] let me say this to you out there in
[55:02] front of you is healing out there in
[55:04] front of you is manifestation out there
[55:06] tonight in front of you is a
[55:08] breakthrough that you can't
[55:11] comprehend but right now you don't see
[55:14] it but when it shows up who's going to
[55:17] argue out argue you out of
[55:21] it who could tell Mary that she wasn't
[55:24] pregnant it when she's felt the baby on
[55:27] the inside of her she received it as an
[55:31] eternal word and she took it in her
[55:34] temporal life and she brought forth the
[55:36] greatest
[55:38] [Applause]
[55:40] Masterpiece that's why you're a virgin
[55:43] bride you have received the spoken word
[55:46] The Original Seed been
[55:50] deposited and Satan does not know what
[55:52] to do with a people that put the their
[55:55] name behind the
[56:08] word I'm built for this thing I'm sorry
[56:11] I
[56:13] tried but Satan don't know what to do
[56:15] with somebody that fully understands who
[56:18] they are you see somebody can back you
[56:21] off back you off when you don't really
[56:23] understand who you are but when you know
[56:25] who you are when you understand who you
[56:28] are then Satan does not know what to do
[56:30] with somebody that looks at things even
[56:33] though they don't see it Satan does not
[56:35] know what to do with somebody that looks
[56:37] out there in the Eternal and they don't
[56:39] see it yet but they believe it with all
[56:42] that's within them and you remember when
[56:44] they're back there when they're back
[56:45] there and they're on the backside of
[56:47] that desert and they're walking around
[56:49] and they got to murmuring and
[56:50] complaining about themselves they got to
[56:52] murmuring well things was better back
[56:54] there I wish we'd go back there and eat
[56:55] the Gard of cloes and everything else we
[56:58] had back there do you understand that as
[57:01] bad as things were down there in Egypt
[57:03] that the known was better to the than
[57:06] the unknown to them that lack
[57:09] Faith so you see people that are
[57:12] constantly leaning on leaning on things
[57:15] that they
[57:16] see it's better for them because they're
[57:19] lacking Faith so they'll trust more in
[57:21] things that they see than the things
[57:23] that they cannot see but we we are a
[57:25] people that do not walk after the flesh
[57:28] though we war after it we don't walk
[57:30] after it that's why you you don't see it
[57:34] yet but it's right here in the room so
[57:38] let me put it to you like this you are
[57:40] fighting for a land that you do not
[57:43] see you are fighting for a promise that
[57:46] you do not see but as long as it's a
[57:48] promise Satan can War you over it but
[57:51] when you possess it when you make
[57:54] yourself War W with that that it's not
[57:56] just for William brandham that it's not
[57:58] just for Paul it's not just for the
[58:01] preachers That's what Satan has a
[58:04] problem with let me say this to you that
[58:06] the only thing that was stopping the
[58:09] children of Israel from going in there
[58:11] was the
[58:13] Jordan it was the only thing that was
[58:15] laying between them and their
[58:18] promises it was the only thing that was
[58:21] physically between the children of
[58:23] Israel and the Promised Land but all
[58:25] they had to do was cross over
[58:27] it but you know that God brought them to
[58:30] a showdown he brought them to a paradox
[58:32] that at the worst of times that God was
[58:34] going to take them over that Jordan
[58:37] River when it was in a time in the
[58:39] springtime when the waters had crested
[58:41] over the banks of the
[58:43] Jordan but God does things in ways that
[58:47] we don't simply understand sometimes so
[58:50] Satan would like to put optical
[58:52] illusions out there to make you feel
[58:54] like the that you can't get over there
[58:56] into your promises but God still got
[58:58] some joshuas and says we're more than
[59:01] able to go over there and take that is
[59:04] which was rightfully mine let me say
[59:06] this to you I know that you can see the
[59:08] Giants over there I know you can see
[59:11] Jericho's walls over there but there's
[59:13] more than just Giants over there there's
[59:15] more than just walls over there there's
[59:17] more than just rivers to cross there's
[59:19] more than just natural things to conquer
[59:21] but there's a resurrection in that land
[59:25] there's a promised seed in that land
[59:27] there's a future home in that land
[59:29] there's a restoration of the brid tree
[59:31] in that land there's modern events made
[59:34] clear in that land and somebody is going
[59:37] to ascend up and receive it and lay
[59:40] claim on their god-given
[59:43] rights Joshua wasn't looking at the
[59:46] walls he knew how to build
[59:49] them he was
[59:51] looking he was looking at somebody that
[59:54] was bigger than
[59:58] him I'm getting ahead of myself I'm
[1:00:00] about I'm about three parts ahead of
[1:00:02] myself just now but I want you to know
[1:00:04] that when Joshua is standing there in
[1:00:06] Joshua chapter 5 I want you to know when
[1:00:09] he catches a glimps of the Lord of hosts
[1:00:12] the Lord is not looking at Jericho the
[1:00:15] Lord is looking at
[1:00:17] Joshua let me say the mighty Angel does
[1:00:20] not have his eyes on leosia the mighty
[1:00:23] Angel has his eyes on on
[1:00:27] you let Russia do what they're going to
[1:00:30] do let Biden say what he's going to say
[1:00:33] let Trump make a fo of himself but God
[1:00:36] has his eyes on you little
[1:00:39] [Applause]
[1:00:42] bride well if he's got his eyes on me
[1:00:45] then I got to have my eyes on
[1:00:51] him oh come on now got the Bible tells
[1:00:55] us in Genesis that every seed is going
[1:00:57] to bring forth of its kind is that
[1:00:59] right it's going to bring forth of its
[1:01:02] kind so so the Bible when he would say
[1:01:04] let the Earth bring forth of its kind
[1:01:06] let the horse and every every animal
[1:01:08] bring forth of its kind so every seed
[1:01:11] has got to bring forth of its kind and
[1:01:14] when brother Brandon would preach the
[1:01:16] spoken word is the Original Seed he said
[1:01:18] he was The Germ word of God he said the
[1:01:21] germ is the spirit The Germ is the water
[1:01:24] and he goes down there and says his
[1:01:26] sheep his fold he said they're going to
[1:01:29] get that word and stay right with it now
[1:01:32] notice what he says he said the seed
[1:01:34] it'll produce Miracles the seed it'll
[1:01:37] produce the power of God it'll produce
[1:01:40] and it will not deny anything because
[1:01:43] it's a kindred spirit or a kindred seed
[1:01:46] with that original seed so you cannot
[1:01:49] accept the word of God and then turn
[1:01:51] around and deny the word of God and prot
[1:01:54] tend to be a part of
[1:01:56] God so you've got to align yourself as
[1:01:59] the genan seed of
[1:02:02] God you've got to align Yourself by the
[1:02:05] word of God and if you are that Jean
[1:02:07] seed then you will perfectly align
[1:02:10] everything in there because you're
[1:02:12] Kindred to
[1:02:13] it is that right that's why William
[1:02:16] Brandon would call you brother
[1:02:18] seed he call you brother seed it's
[1:02:21] because he looked out there and he saw
[1:02:23] the same thing that was planted in the
[1:02:26] original brother Ram said that
[1:02:28] everything that Adam lost Jesus was so
[1:02:32] he looked out there and he saw the same
[1:02:34] thing in Jesus that he saw in the body
[1:02:38] of Jesus
[1:02:40] Christ oh my so let me put it to you
[1:02:43] like this that over in that inheritance
[1:02:46] there's blessings there over in that
[1:02:48] land there's Miracles there over in that
[1:02:51] land for the very first time there's
[1:02:53] going to be an Israelite black baby that
[1:02:55] will be born outside of the economy of
[1:02:58] Egypt and it's no longer going to live
[1:03:00] under the citizenship citizenship of
[1:03:03] Egypt but it's going to live under the
[1:03:06] citizenship as the kingdom of almighty
[1:03:09] God they're going to be a citizens of
[1:03:11] Visions they're going to be a citizens
[1:03:13] of reality they're going to be citizens
[1:03:15] of the promise citizens of the
[1:03:18] fellowship from
[1:03:21] above that's why you must be born again
[1:03:27] because this citizenship that you have
[1:03:29] in the natural it denies everything that
[1:03:31] you are in the
[1:03:35] spiritual you see that's why you must be
[1:03:37] born again because you see the new birth
[1:03:40] is about you recognizing that God is
[1:03:41] your father and God Alone is your father
[1:03:44] you see because under your first birth
[1:03:46] there's fornication laying there you
[1:03:48] said well I never did that but it's
[1:03:50] laying there there's uncleanliness
[1:03:52] laying there there's inordinate
[1:03:53] affection that's laying there there's
[1:03:55] evil concupisent that's laying there
[1:03:57] there's covet this that which is
[1:03:59] idolatry that is laying there you to
[1:04:01] well brother Andrew I'm not guilty of
[1:04:03] all those things it's laying in your
[1:04:04] first birth that's why Paul would tell
[1:04:07] us that you've got to mortify the Deeds
[1:04:09] of your flesh that's why you've got to
[1:04:12] attach yourself as the Jean seed of God
[1:04:15] to the Papa God because in your first
[1:04:19] birth it's death laying there but in
[1:04:21] your new birth in your new birth there's
[1:04:24] a power to live a Sanctified life the
[1:04:27] power of God is laying under your new
[1:04:29] birth blessings are laying under your
[1:04:31] new birth shoutings of Grace Grace is in
[1:04:34] your new birth Divine health is in your
[1:04:37] new birth all the RS of the father is
[1:04:39] laying there in your new birth but the
[1:04:43] only thing that is keeping you from that
[1:04:45] is
[1:04:46] Jordan but you don't need some bridge
[1:04:49] builder to get you over Jordan just
[1:04:51] stand back and watch what God's getting
[1:04:53] ready to do
[1:04:55] what is it brother Andrew just wait just
[1:04:58] wait and watch don't you try to figure
[1:05:00] out how God's going to get you across
[1:05:02] all these things just stand back take
[1:05:04] God at his word let the word step into
[1:05:07] the water first and watch the miraculous
[1:05:09] get ready to take place the only thing
[1:05:13] that is keeping you from a Rapture is
[1:05:19] death well Glory that's why God has
[1:05:23] selected of people in this generation to
[1:05:26] bypass death you are a chosen generation
[1:05:30] a royal priesthood set aside for service
[1:05:33] and you're the only people on the face
[1:05:35] of the Earth that's getting ready to
[1:05:39] experience come on somebody death can't
[1:05:42] harm you because you have got a hold of
[1:05:45] it because the god that died on the
[1:05:47] cross on Friday Rose up on Sunday
[1:05:51] morning and he made himself and showed
[1:05:53] himself a public
[1:05:55] testimony that you are not identified in
[1:06:03] death you can go listen to you can go
[1:06:06] listen to The Prophet on the first part
[1:06:08] or the on the front side of the seals
[1:06:11] you can hear him even say it in the
[1:06:12] breach that there was a Chasm and the
[1:06:15] chasm was too great but you get on the
[1:06:17] backside of the seals and brother
[1:06:19] brandom said that God did away with that
[1:06:21] Gap that God did away with that
[1:06:24] do you understand what the blood of
[1:06:26] Jesus Christ to you is to you as a
[1:06:28] Church of the Living God it did away
[1:06:31] with your first nature that's why there
[1:06:34] is an invisible Union with the bride and
[1:06:37] the bridegroom you don't see what's
[1:06:39] happening it's unseen but the
[1:06:43] seed the seed on the inside of you Jesus
[1:06:47] looked out there and he saw a matching
[1:06:52] piece I don't know what any of other way
[1:06:54] to put it like this but like this is
[1:06:56] that everything that the seven Church
[1:06:58] ages had hoped for is right here within
[1:07:01] the grasp of the Church of the Living
[1:07:03] God what Paul hoped for what what all of
[1:07:06] those great men throughout the ages had
[1:07:09] hoped for is right here on your
[1:07:14] fingertips come on let me tell you
[1:07:16] eternal security has been restored the
[1:07:19] serpent seed has been restored godhead
[1:07:23] rightfully has been
[1:07:25] restored the body change what men
[1:07:28] thought has been perfectly
[1:07:33] restored now notice brother mandam takes
[1:07:36] a I just want to maybe labor on this
[1:07:39] thought just for a minute brother
[1:07:41] Brandon preaches a message Paradox he
[1:07:43] said Joshua here is a book actually it's
[1:07:46] a book of redemption of the Old
[1:07:47] Testament he said Joshua he said we
[1:07:50] could have we would have to consider it
[1:07:52] to be that the book book of redemption
[1:07:54] because its Redemption has two parts
[1:07:57] Redemption anywhere has two parts that
[1:07:59] is out of and into he said it takes two
[1:08:02] parts to make Redemption out of and into
[1:08:05] he said so Moses represented the law
[1:08:08] which brought them out of Egypt and
[1:08:09] whereas Joshua represented Grace that
[1:08:12] took them into the promised land he said
[1:08:14] another way was that the law and Grace
[1:08:17] were two different aspects of God's
[1:08:18] command he said the law brought them out
[1:08:22] but Moses under Moses and Joshua took
[1:08:25] them in now I want you to notice what
[1:08:27] brother Ram said he said it also
[1:08:29] represents something for our
[1:08:31] day now I love I love listening to what
[1:08:35] Paul had in his day and I enjoy reading
[1:08:37] about David and Daniel and all of them
[1:08:39] but I want to know what's for me when I
[1:08:42] read the Bible I don't try to see other
[1:08:44] brothers in there I try to find what's
[1:08:46] laying there so when the prophet said
[1:08:49] that it represents something for our day
[1:08:51] then it ought to click our Attention our
[1:08:54] is up and we ought to be listening to it
[1:08:56] he said therefore the law brought them
[1:08:58] out and Joshua took them in he said it
[1:09:01] also represent something for our day he
[1:09:04] said it represents as they were in their
[1:09:06] Journey coming from Egypt into a
[1:09:08] promised land so have we come out of a
[1:09:10] world of Egypt Chaos on on a road to the
[1:09:13] promised land notice what he does
[1:09:15] remember there's a place by me there's a
[1:09:19] position for you that the prophet ties
[1:09:22] it to John chapter 14 that in my
[1:09:25] father's house are many mansions he said
[1:09:28] if it wasn't so then I would have told
[1:09:30] you he said so it is it's coming out of
[1:09:33] and going
[1:09:35] into so that's why there's got to be
[1:09:37] another Ephesians there's got to be a
[1:09:39] coming out of to be able to go into you
[1:09:41] say well brother Andrew I don't come out
[1:09:43] of
[1:09:44] denominations well you got to come out
[1:09:46] of your message you got to come out of
[1:09:48] your message Theology of saying well I'm
[1:09:50] just okay because I'm under the message
[1:09:52] you got to come out of
[1:09:57] that I'm trying I'm not trying to be
[1:09:59] offensive but I'm trying to I'm trying
[1:10:01] to make some points here I don't want
[1:10:02] I'm talking to anybody here but You' got
[1:10:04] to people got to come out of that the
[1:10:06] that thought or that Theology of
[1:10:08] thinking well I'm under the message I
[1:10:09] believe you God s a prophet you've got
[1:10:11] to come out of that to be able to go
[1:10:13] into Heavenly places you got to come out
[1:10:16] of church tradition to be able to go
[1:10:17] into the Supernatural is that right
[1:10:20] you've got to come out of your past to
[1:10:22] be able to go into your future future
[1:10:24] because your future as a son and
[1:10:26] daughter of God is laying right here in
[1:10:28] your
[1:10:29] inheritance so go ahead go ahead and
[1:10:33] make a claim on your
[1:10:37] future go ahead and make a claim on
[1:10:40] it is that right I believe that you're
[1:10:42] in position for it I believe that you're
[1:10:44] in a season to lay claim on what's
[1:10:46] rightfully yours I believe that you're
[1:10:48] perfectly in season for it you know you
[1:10:52] if you'd see me come out here and start
[1:10:53] start carrying a surfboard you know
[1:10:55] where I'm
[1:10:57] going I ain't going to the hills I'm
[1:11:00] going to the beach so you'd know what
[1:11:02] season that I'm in if I started carrying
[1:11:04] a surfboard somewhere you'd also think I
[1:11:06] lost my
[1:11:07] mind but if I come out here and I
[1:11:09] started carrying skis and snowboards
[1:11:11] you'd say hey that dude's headed to the
[1:11:13] mountains he's going to go skiing so you
[1:11:15] see me in my season that I'm looking at
[1:11:18] so if I walk out here and I'm carrying
[1:11:21] the head of
[1:11:22] Goliath
[1:11:24] you know what season I'm in it's devil
[1:11:27] Killing Season let me say this to you it
[1:11:30] is open season on every devil in hell
[1:11:33] and it's time we fill our
[1:11:37] tickets it's time we feel every single
[1:11:40] one of those tags the demon of anxiety
[1:11:44] let's feel that tag the demon of
[1:11:46] depression let's feel that tag let's
[1:11:49] feel the
[1:11:50] tag that Satan constantly War in your
[1:11:54] family and causing distractions let's
[1:11:57] feel a
[1:11:58] [Applause]
[1:12:00] tag so you know what season I'm in when
[1:12:03] I walk out as a fully manifested Son of
[1:12:06] God wrapped up in my adoption robes
[1:12:09] fully baptized by the baptism of the
[1:12:12] Holy Ghost you know that I'm living in
[1:12:14] Revelations
[1:12:19] 10 I'm going to preach some things to
[1:12:21] you tonight that I know that you believe
[1:12:23] but you cannot walk out here thinking
[1:12:26] that you're in the days of Luther and
[1:12:27] try to manifest as a son and daughter of
[1:12:29] God because it'll never work under
[1:12:32] Luther's
[1:12:33] message is that right so you know what
[1:12:36] season that we're in we're in the season
[1:12:39] of the coming of the
[1:12:45] Lord you see you see if you got a man
[1:12:47] you got a man out there that's swimming
[1:12:49] in water and he's drowning out there in
[1:12:50] water what do you do you got to get the
[1:12:53] man out of the water before you can get
[1:12:55] the water out of the man and that's why
[1:12:57] God knew that he had to get them out of
[1:12:59] Egypt before he could get Egypt out of
[1:13:01] them because they knew that as long as
[1:13:04] they were living in that condition they
[1:13:06] would have that kind of
[1:13:08] mentality that's why God would say to
[1:13:11] you in Philippians 2 and5 let this mind
[1:13:13] be in you which was also in Christ Jesus
[1:13:16] you've got to change your
[1:13:19] language you no longer can think the
[1:13:22] thoughts
[1:13:24] I know it takes some people a little bit
[1:13:26] longer in time or they they get maybe a
[1:13:29] little bit more delay but either way
[1:13:31] it's a presence of the Lord that makes
[1:13:33] them change it changes them but you
[1:13:37] watch you got ladies and brothers that
[1:13:39] are sitting here that were one way and
[1:13:41] you can never identify them as that
[1:13:43] anymore why because God implanted a part
[1:13:47] of himself on the inside of them and it
[1:13:50] came to full quickening power
[1:13:55] I know you might get upset and you might
[1:13:56] see things in people's lives that maybe
[1:13:59] don't perfectly line up with the message
[1:14:01] but you give them a little bit of time
[1:14:03] under the message of the hour don't you
[1:14:05] try to clean them up you let the word do
[1:14:07] that come on somebody it ain't your job
[1:14:11] it ain't my job it's the word's job
[1:14:14] because if I clean them up and you clean
[1:14:16] them up they only go so far but before
[1:14:20] we get the river out of them we got to
[1:14:22] get them out the
[1:14:25] River come on somebody that's why you no
[1:14:29] longer talk leoty and talk it's because
[1:14:32] you have been brought out of
[1:14:37] leosia come on somebody I no longer talk
[1:14:40] the talk of a drug addict or a dopehead
[1:14:44] or somebody that was walking away from
[1:14:45] God I talk the language of a Son of
[1:14:51] God blessed be the name name of the Lord
[1:14:54] that's why Joshua could stand out there
[1:14:56] because he was fully operating under his
[1:14:59] message he knew he had every right to
[1:15:01] walk in there and kicking jebus Heights
[1:15:07] out now look the Bible said in
[1:15:09] Deuteronomy 2:24 rise up and take your
[1:15:13] journey and pass over the river of Arab
[1:15:15] behold I've given unto the thine hand
[1:15:18] sign and the Amorite king of heshbon and
[1:15:21] his land begin to possess bless it and
[1:15:24] contend with him in battle verse 31 and
[1:15:27] the Lord said unto me behold I have
[1:15:29] begun to give you Zion in the land
[1:15:31] before thee begin to possess it that
[1:15:33] thou mayest inherit this
[1:15:36] land so God gave you a gift God was
[1:15:39] physically giv them a gift but they had
[1:15:43] to go in there and fight for
[1:15:46] it they had to go in I've begun to give
[1:15:49] it you got to begin to possess
[1:15:51] it we said brother Andrew I just really
[1:15:54] ain't into that fighting
[1:15:55] mode you know that's really that's your
[1:15:58] job that's that's the preacher's
[1:16:01] job let somebody say something about
[1:16:03] your
[1:16:05] child say something about Bee's children
[1:16:09] that's Brenda Klein back here if y'all
[1:16:10] don't know it you say something about
[1:16:12] her children you watch she'll get to
[1:16:15] fighting you see some people they they
[1:16:17] usually well I I really you know we
[1:16:19] ought to have the spirit of Love brother
[1:16:21] Andrew I believe that but not that kind
[1:16:23] of love not the kind of love that we
[1:16:26] decide that it's okay to coexist with
[1:16:28] the
[1:16:30] devil because you find a lot of times
[1:16:33] that it's easier to it's easier to
[1:16:36] coexist with the devil than to contend
[1:16:39] with the devil it's easier to stand out
[1:16:41] there and deal with the little problems
[1:16:43] and say well I've dealt with that for so
[1:16:44] long I know how to overcome that instead
[1:16:47] of really getting rid of it it's
[1:16:49] easy it's easy to let that Devil stay
[1:16:52] right there on your property and let him
[1:16:54] do his own thing and you watch every
[1:16:56] single time that the that the tribes of
[1:16:58] Israel let and let the enemy stay on
[1:17:00] their land you watch they begin to
[1:17:03] corrupt themselves with idol
[1:17:06] worship I don't know where we get here
[1:17:08] but you've got to dispossess do you know
[1:17:11] that is a part of the word inherit that
[1:17:14] was spoke to Abraham before Moses ever
[1:17:17] showed up before Joshua ever showed up
[1:17:20] said you've got to inherit and when you
[1:17:22] break down the word inherit in the
[1:17:24] Hebrew language it means to dispossess
[1:17:27] to be an a of to go in there possess it
[1:17:30] it means you got to go in there and you
[1:17:32] got to kick that devil
[1:17:34] out now this ain't I ain't talking about

[1:17:40] that much problem you don't need to get

[1:17:55] little devil on the inside of you will
[1:17:57] find its way how to find that certain
[1:18:01] spot the only way to fix it is a new
[1:18:06] birth so to rightly divide the
[1:18:08] inheritance you got to kick the devil
[1:18:11] off of your
[1:18:15] property well come on somebody I watched

[1:18:49] baptism of the Holy
[1:18:51] Ghost
[1:18:53] well now they're going to clip out and
[1:18:54] say at brother Andrew he's a TV preacher
[1:18:57] let me tell you co all made us TV
[1:19:02] preachers I was a televangelist
[1:19:06] overnight do you feel like reaching out
[1:19:09] there and touching
[1:19:19] something
[1:19:21] wow
[1:19:27] but once you
[1:19:28] move that's funny
[1:19:33] man wow help me
[1:19:37] Jesus you sure he didn't want to take
[1:19:39] tonight but once you move into this land
[1:19:43] once you move into it once you move into
[1:19:45] the Holy Ghost once you move into your
[1:19:46] rful inheritance you got to rule that
[1:19:49] land you got to rule that land it's not
[1:19:52] just to get ready for the Harvest not
[1:19:54] just to go out there and plow and make
[1:19:56] ready for the Harvest and plant seeds
[1:19:58] you got to stand out there like shamgar
[1:20:00] he plowed he planted but there come a
[1:20:03] time when he had to dispossess what the
[1:20:06] devil was taking from him and that's a
[1:20:09] part of dividing The Inheritance you got
[1:20:12] to fight for every one of your god-given
[1:20:15] privileges you've got benefits that are
[1:20:17] laying there that the devil's robbing
[1:20:20] from you that he stealing away from you
[1:20:22] but the only way to fully conquer the
[1:20:25] land is kick that devil
[1:20:27] [Applause]
[1:20:35] out I want you to noce
[1:20:37] this you simply being on that land makes
[1:20:41] the devil aggravated agitated enough
[1:20:44] that he simply wants to just come over
[1:20:47] there because you're on the
[1:20:51] land I mean how many fights it right
[1:20:54] here you didn't think one thing about
[1:20:56] getting in the spirit when you wasn't in
[1:20:58] the spirit but when the spirit of the
[1:21:00] Lord started moving on you and you begin
[1:21:02] to get under it and you begin to get
[1:21:04] under the anointing and you begin to
[1:21:05] amen the word of God all of a sudden
[1:21:07] that critical devil stands out there and
[1:21:09] say no no no no no no no no no no no
[1:21:12] don't go no further don't don't don't
[1:21:14] don't don't raise your hand don't don't
[1:21:15] lift your voice don't amen that you was
[1:21:17] living one way and that devil wasn't
[1:21:19] bothering you one bit but as soon as you
[1:21:22] moved into your were full inheritance
[1:21:24] that devil showed up and said hey don't
[1:21:26] do that that's my land and he started
[1:21:29] trying to creep in he tried to creep in
[1:21:33] that's what brother Brandon would talk
[1:21:34] about a creeper that that creeper would
[1:21:36] try to come in there and it would wrap
[1:21:38] itself around that weat and it would
[1:21:40] draw the very life out of that true
[1:21:43] genuine seed it can be the real thing
[1:21:45] but the creeper comes in there and he
[1:21:49] starts pulling the very life out of your
[1:21:51] experience as a a son and daughter of
[1:21:53] God you can be filled with the Holy
[1:21:55] Ghost but that devil could creep right
[1:21:56] in
[1:21:59] there but the Bible said in in numbers
[1:22:02] 33 and 53 that you shall to dispossess
[1:22:05] the inhabitants of the land and dwell
[1:22:08] therein for I have given you the land to
[1:22:11] possess it and you shall divide the land
[1:22:14] by lot for an inheritance among your
[1:22:16] families so God gave Joshua a
[1:22:21] map he gave gave him a physical map of
[1:22:25] where they were to go in there and go in
[1:22:28] there and conquer the
[1:22:30] land ain't it a shame when you go all
[1:22:34] the way back you go to reading Genesis
[1:22:36] or Joshua 17 and 18 they've been this
[1:22:40] long with Joshua they've been this long
[1:22:42] under the
[1:22:43] commission you got two and a half tribes
[1:22:45] on the other side of Jordan they've
[1:22:47] already got their land and you get over
[1:22:49] in Genesis 18 and it says that seven
[1:22:53] tribes had not even began to possess
[1:22:55] their
[1:22:57] land how long have they been there and
[1:23:01] watch the supernatural they'd watch
[1:23:03] Joshua 2 they watch Joshua 5 they watch
[1:23:05] Joshua 6 they watch Joshua
[1:23:08] 10 but that shows you that carnal people
[1:23:12] will never be able to live in a
[1:23:14] supernatural
[1:23:16] realm but Supernatural people can be in
[1:23:19] a carnal spot and still go in there
[1:23:22] possess that land they will refuse to
[1:23:25] live in the place that Satan's trying to
[1:23:28] make them live
[1:23:30] at that's why you raise up and say I
[1:23:32] don't have to live here I don't have to
[1:23:34] live in this condition I don't have to
[1:23:36] live under this turmoil you don't have
[1:23:38] to live in fear you don't have to live
[1:23:40] in anxiety you don't have to live in a
[1:23:42] house that's always boiling up and
[1:23:44] brawling at one another and constantly
[1:23:46] bickering back and
[1:23:47] forth if you're a supernatural being I
[1:23:51] believe that you are you have every
[1:23:53] right to create an atmosphere said not
[1:23:58] here you can change where you're living
[1:24:01] at by the power of your
[1:24:05] confession he got a map to him and you
[1:24:08] got a map you got a map more greater
[1:24:11] than what Joshua had and brother Brandon
[1:24:14] would come to us and he preached the
[1:24:15] greatest battle ever fought he would
[1:24:17] tell us that there is where Satan
[1:24:19] battles us at is in the realm of our
[1:24:21] flesh in the realm of our spirit and
[1:24:24] he's Waring after your soul but you do
[1:24:27] not have carnal
[1:24:30] weapons you have a mighty weapon it's
[1:24:33] pulling down the strongholds of
[1:24:38] Satan you have every right to go in
[1:24:42] there and said this is mine brother man
[1:24:45] said well he in the testimony of a
[1:24:47] raising a dead boy he said well anything
[1:24:49] that said that Satan's put upon you in
[1:24:51] the way of sickness he said whatever it
[1:24:52] is every Born Again person has an
[1:24:55] abstract warrant has a warrant from God
[1:24:58] and the Holy Spirit is here to put any
[1:24:59] devil out no matter if he's a cancer if
[1:25:02] he's a cataract or whatever it is the
[1:25:05] holy spirit will put him
[1:25:07] out the holy spirit will put him out the
[1:25:11] holy spirit will put him out if you'll
[1:25:14] serve notice on
[1:25:17] him if you'll serve notice on him in the
[1:25:20] name of Jesus Christ cuz he has no legal
[1:25:23] rights I am the Lord that Health all of
[1:25:26] thy diseases he was wounded for my
[1:25:28] transgressions and with his stripes we
[1:25:30] are healed but you've got to go over and
[1:25:33] take
[1:25:35] it let me say it like this it's time to
[1:25:37] dismiss the
[1:25:41] devil it's time to dismiss the devil you
[1:25:43] ever went into a school office you kids
[1:25:45] walked up in there and you
[1:25:47] was teacher said you did something and
[1:25:49] you really think you didn't do it and
[1:25:51] they and and the principal says you're
[1:25:53] dismissed and you're TR still trying to
[1:25:55] plead your
[1:25:56] case that's the way that the devil's
[1:25:58] trying to that's the way you got to do
[1:26:00] the devil even though he keeps
[1:26:02] blabbering his mouth dismiss that thing
[1:26:05] dismiss him say you're not welcome here
[1:26:07] you're out of the room get out of here
[1:26:09] get out of my mind get out of my spirit
[1:26:10] get out of my soul get out of my
[1:26:13] family dismiss that
[1:26:16] devil but don't you fail to go in there
[1:26:19] and possess your
[1:26:21] inheritance all these things I begun to
[1:26:24] give it to you you begin to possess it
[1:26:27] so you got a job to do when you go to
[1:26:30] read in John chap 11 when Lazarus is
[1:26:33] dead he's dead and they they look at him
[1:26:36] but when they're looking on
[1:26:38] Jesus they ain't wanting just lazarus's
[1:26:41] they ain't just wanting his
[1:26:44] inheritance they ain't just wanting him
[1:26:46] back just because of memory sake they
[1:26:49] just they there was something laying on
[1:26:52] the inside of them that they long
[1:26:55] for it was not just so that they could
[1:26:57] have the key to where he' left
[1:26:59] everything in his will and put it over
[1:27:00] in the safe box and all these things
[1:27:03] they were wanting the life of him is
[1:27:06] that right they were literally wanting
[1:27:08] the life of him to be honest to be
[1:27:11] honest what are you asking for when you
[1:27:13] ask for your
[1:27:15] prodal it's a dangerous thing sometimes
[1:27:17] when you put God when you hand them over
[1:27:20] to almighty God and you put them in the
[1:27:21] hands of God
[1:27:22] you better know what you're asking for
[1:27:24] because when God goes to doing
[1:27:26] business if God is after them he might
[1:27:30] kill them to save them from
[1:27:33] tribulation but what are you really
[1:27:38] after really what are we after are we
[1:27:41] just after the natural things if I want
[1:27:43] them back so that I could so that I
[1:27:44] could spend time than them that I could
[1:27:46] roll back the time but are you really
[1:27:48] wanting the Eternal thing when they ask
[1:27:51] for Lazarus life they were asking for
[1:27:54] the person of
[1:27:56] him what did they get back they got
[1:28:00] Lazarus
[1:28:05] back what are you asking for tonight
[1:28:08] what are you believing for it's got to
[1:28:10] be bigger than what you're
[1:28:21] thinking the Unseen things are worth
[1:28:23] fighting
[1:28:24] for the things that you don't see the
[1:28:26] things that you don't understand those
[1:28:27] things are worth fighting for you know
[1:28:30] that in the US right now there's over
[1:28:32] $49 billion dollar that is
[1:28:36] unclaimed I'd say you can put my name
[1:28:39] right there I know what I do with it I
[1:28:42] pay my ti on
[1:28:45] it there's $49
[1:28:47] billion unclaimed in America right now
[1:28:52] most of it most of it is in bank
[1:28:56] accounts that people
[1:29:00] forgot that'd be something bad to forget
[1:29:03] and then it's in tax refunds that people
[1:29:05] didn't claim or that maybe didn't get to
[1:29:07] the right
[1:29:09] address and then there's the untold case
[1:29:12] of when somebody dies and that they
[1:29:15] didn't give it to the right person or
[1:29:16] the person they didn't find out exactly
[1:29:18] right and then the state takes it over
[1:29:20] so the state takes those assets and they
[1:29:23] put it in there $49 billion is laying
[1:29:25] there and most of those times in those
[1:29:27] cases it's because of the inheritance or
[1:29:30] The Heirs didn't even know that they had
[1:29:33] something coming that's why the prophet
[1:29:36] would say you're living below your
[1:29:38] god-given
[1:29:39] privileges now I don't know too many
[1:29:41] fully Holy Ghost filled people that are
[1:29:43] living below their god-given privileges
[1:29:46] but I do know that there are people that
[1:29:48] can go higher and there are there are
[1:29:52] things that are laying out there on the
[1:29:53] table if there's $49 billion that's
[1:29:57] laying in the natural what's laying out
[1:29:59] in spiritual realm I'd say that there's
[1:30:02] healings that are right here that you
[1:30:05] have every right to tap into i' say
[1:30:07] that's rightfully minded so basically
[1:30:10] The Inheritance is hanging in limbo and
[1:30:14] the only way the only way that this
[1:30:18] inheritance gets unlocked the only way
[1:30:21] it gets unlocked
[1:30:22] is the right
[1:30:24] identity it's the only way that it can
[1:30:26] be unlocked is by the right
[1:30:29] identity and if you brought them a
[1:30:31] picture of yourself as a
[1:30:34] baby they're not going to let you pass
[1:30:36] that's not going to be it's not going to
[1:30:38] fly because it's not matching what you
[1:30:40] are right now so when God snapped a
[1:30:44] picture of you as a Son of God he
[1:30:47] snapped a picture of you not as a baby
[1:30:49] he snapped you a picture of you as a
[1:30:52] fully identified Son of God and when you
[1:30:55] walk in there you've got to have the
[1:30:57] right inheritance to say this is mine
[1:31:01] Uncle Joe left this to me and it's
[1:31:03] rightfully mine that's the way you can
[1:31:05] go in there to God I have Ephesians 4:30
[1:31:09] over top of my life and I pull down my
[1:31:13] rightful
[1:31:17] inheritance that's the only way you're
[1:31:18] going to get
[1:31:20] this but you notice what Satan does he
[1:31:24] likes to steal
[1:31:25] identity he likes to match up you notice
[1:31:28] that that we don't know the only way
[1:31:30] that we know him by is Legion he's the
[1:31:33] only way that we know that wasn't his
[1:31:35] real
[1:31:36] name but Satan had stolen his identity
[1:31:39] that when he comes before Jesus in Mark
[1:31:41] chapter 5 he couldn't even remember his
[1:31:44] own
[1:31:45] name he couldn't even remember who he
[1:31:47] rightfully was and brother Ram said he
[1:31:50] he was a right man in one spot he was
[1:31:53] living a Godly life in one spot he said
[1:31:55] he got to playing cards and running over
[1:31:58] here and started taking a little social
[1:31:59] drink had a nice wife and two children
[1:32:02] back home but Satan had so stolen his
[1:32:05] identity that he could not remember who
[1:32:07] he
[1:32:08] was but notice what Jesus did Jesus
[1:32:12] reversed the curse he reversed the curse
[1:32:15] so that he could remember who he was he
[1:32:17] went back to his home and immediately
[1:32:20] brother Thomas immediately
[1:32:22] what did he do he's sitting at the feet
[1:32:24] of Jesus when Satan had stripped him of
[1:32:28] his clothes had stripped him of his
[1:32:30] identity but immediately brother Randy
[1:32:33] he's sitting right there at the feet of
[1:32:35] Jesus what is it when the word comes by
[1:32:37] your way it reverses the curse that's
[1:32:40] upon your
[1:32:42] life you've got every right to go in
[1:32:44] there and dispossess what Satan has
[1:32:47] robbed from you and go in
[1:32:49] there say this is right mind and you may
[1:32:53] not feel like you're strong enough but
[1:32:54] there is somebody that is standing up
[1:32:57] for you that is standing up on your
[1:32:59] behalf you can look in Daniel chapter 12
[1:33:02] and you can see one who is like God
[1:33:04] Michael standing up for the children of
[1:33:06] Israel in the time of
[1:33:09] trouble what does the Bible say it says
[1:33:12] that in that time he will bring
[1:33:14] Deliverance to the people now the Book
[1:33:16] of Daniel is to the Jews as the Book of
[1:33:19] Revelation is to us gentiles
[1:33:22] and it perfectly lines up with
[1:33:24] Revelations chap 10 then I saw another
[1:33:27] Mighty Angel Christ standing up what was
[1:33:31] he standing up in in a time of
[1:33:34] conflict but when do you see him in
[1:33:36] Revelations chapter 10 and 5 he's
[1:33:39] standing there and he's got his right
[1:33:41] hand pointed towards
[1:33:43] heaven what is he doing he's making an
[1:33:46] affidavit he's swearing by himself that
[1:33:49] the same one that was there in he
[1:33:51] Hebrews chapter 6 is the same one that
[1:33:53] is standing there in Revelations chap 10
[1:33:56] and he swore by himself that the time of
[1:33:59] holding back the Mysteries would be no
[1:34:02] longer what did he said what does this
[1:34:04] voice say to him go and take the book go
[1:34:09] and take the book John eat the book
[1:34:11] become the book so if you can only
[1:34:13] realize what the church has in their
[1:34:16] possession it's the deed to eternal
[1:34:20] life it was in Luther's day it wasn't in
[1:34:23] Wesley's day but it was in this day it
[1:34:27] was in this hour that the Covenant Angel
[1:34:30] he swore by himself that the time of
[1:34:32] holding back all the Mysteries would be
[1:34:34] no longer that it would be in the days
[1:34:37] of the
[1:34:38] voice that this time would come that it
[1:34:41] would be the releas of all
[1:34:43] things and before you can ever go into a
[1:34:46] court of law and you can sign an
[1:34:48] affidavit and put your name on it
[1:34:52] you got to confirm it by an oath that
[1:34:53] everything that is stated here on this
[1:34:56] is perfectly the
[1:34:59] truth that's why God is standing there
[1:35:01] in Revelations chapter 10 and the lamb
[1:35:04] stood up in this day and confirmed it by
[1:35:06] an oath and said that the seals have
[1:35:09] been released to the body of Jesus
[1:35:10] Christ that it's no longer a thunder but
[1:35:13] we've received the voice that Jesus has
[1:35:16] signed our pardon and if you be Christ
[1:35:19] then are you Abraham's seed and a
[1:35:21] according to the promise so if you have
[1:35:25] everything that's rightfully
[1:35:28] yours you have an abstract title D to it
[1:35:32] that if you go home tonight and
[1:35:34] somebody's sitting on your front porch
[1:35:35] and slipping sipping your sweet tea you
[1:35:37] got every right by the abstract title
[1:35:39] deed to call the law on them and say get
[1:35:42] out of here get out of your mind get out
[1:35:44] of my mind get out of my family get out
[1:35:46] of my
[1:35:47] body you've got an abstract title Deed
[1:35:50] by you Believing on the Holy Ghost and
[1:35:53] the Holy Ghost accepts
[1:35:56] you it's the Assurance of the
[1:36:00] abstract when brother Ram when brother
[1:36:03] brandom is dealing with a child that's
[1:36:05] got a problem got a problem with it
[1:36:07] waste he tells him said look he prays
[1:36:10] for him he said now come back in three
[1:36:12] days tie tie tie a string around your
[1:36:15] waist and bring it back in 3 days and
[1:36:17] show me the
[1:36:19] progress when he came back
[1:36:21] it had the the condition had completely
[1:36:24] had completely gone away the very next
[1:36:27] person in that line was a hunchback boy
[1:36:30] brother brandham said and he said I
[1:36:32] simply looked at him and said now you go
[1:36:34] and do the same thing that I told him
[1:36:37] wrap a ring wrap a string around it and
[1:36:39] go back and come back and the boy said
[1:36:41] now notice
[1:36:43] this the boy said brother
[1:36:45] brandom we're on our last dollar being
[1:36:49] here I can't come back in three days I
[1:36:52] got to have this right
[1:36:54] now so brother bham turns brother bham
[1:36:58] turns to him and praise the prayer of
[1:37:01] faith over him and as brother Brenham
[1:37:03] has his hand on his back brother Brenham
[1:37:05] said he felt that hunch completely go
[1:37:08] in that boy had enough faith that I
[1:37:12] can't wait another
[1:37:15] day that's why Peter when he's standing
[1:37:17] out there he's out there in the boat and
[1:37:19] the storm is going on around him said
[1:37:22] Lord if that's you bid me to
[1:37:24] come that's why you got to be that
[1:37:27] desperate in a church service like
[1:37:30] this that you got to say I can't wait no
[1:37:34] longer I can't wait I can't put up with
[1:37:36] this no
[1:37:37] longer that boy didn't have another
[1:37:40] dollar to spend he didn't have another
[1:37:43] moment but he got so
[1:37:46] desperate brother Bon said what did he
[1:37:48] do he did exactly what Jude chapter 1
[1:37:50] and3 tells us to earnestly contend for
[1:37:52] the faith that was once delivered to the
[1:37:54] Saints and brother brandom said that
[1:37:56] that faith that that little boy had was
[1:37:58] the
[1:38:00] faith it was the faith that they
[1:38:02] contended for so it's worth fighting
[1:38:07] for you know what happened directly
[1:38:09] after that little boy it caused such a
[1:38:13] stir what if you
[1:38:15] tonight would cause such a stir that
[1:38:18] there would be a whirl of faith in this
[1:38:20] building
[1:38:22] there'd be a world of faith in this
[1:38:24] building that somebody would receive
[1:38:28] something because you denied the
[1:38:31] devil I don't have another moment to put
[1:38:33] up with this I'm on my last
[1:38:39] string some of you are
[1:38:42] there some of you are
[1:38:45] there and that's why Satan has fought so
[1:38:48] hard to keep
[1:38:50] you keep you out of
[1:38:52] this because of this
[1:38:55] moment because this boy created such a
[1:38:59] whirl of faith that the very next person
[1:39:02] in line is a blind
[1:39:03] woman she couldn't even see to get in
[1:39:06] the line people had to line her and get
[1:39:07] her up there sister
[1:39:10] Gabrielle brother Brandon said that she
[1:39:12] had the faith that they had earnestly
[1:39:15] contended
[1:39:16] for brother brandom said when the prayer
[1:39:19] of faith was prayed over top of her he
[1:39:21] said he said we didn't have to get the
[1:39:23] testimony from her he said she typed out
[1:39:25] her own testimony and gave it to
[1:39:30] us don't let somebody else tell your
[1:39:34] story you watch what Satan has
[1:39:37] done over the past few weeks we have
[1:39:40] been living in the land of testimony and
[1:39:42] hell has been causing disruption after
[1:39:46] disruption after disruption trying to
[1:39:48] get you distracted right
[1:39:52] I know what I'm talking about I don't
[1:39:54] even know what I'm doing but I know
[1:39:55] exactly where I'm living at and Satan is
[1:39:58] trying to get you scared
[1:40:03] away don't you let somebody else tell
[1:40:05] your story this is your story you got
[1:40:08] every right to testify about it don't
[1:40:10] you let some devil try to steal away
[1:40:12] your
[1:40:19] joy I can't tell you everything but I
[1:40:21] ain't going I ain't going to tell you
[1:40:22] every detail but I want you to know when
[1:40:24] I stood here 3 four weeks ago and I said
[1:40:28] that God will do a test will do a
[1:40:30] miracle this
[1:40:32] week I can't tell you everything but
[1:40:35] trust me there was Miracle after Miracle
[1:40:37] after Miracle after miracle that took
[1:40:39] place well I'm going to need some proof
[1:40:41] of
[1:40:43] it
[1:40:45] look look there's a man standing in this
[1:40:48] room that's in this church that they had
[1:40:52] Bel dealt with things in their in their
[1:40:54] natural
[1:40:59] family there was some money that had
[1:41:01] been held back from them that was there
[1:41:03] rightfully
[1:41:04] theirs but when God spoke a word that
[1:41:07] there was going to be a miracle a
[1:41:08] miracle released something that they had
[1:41:10] been fighting for
[1:41:13] years and released a potential a
[1:41:16] blessing upon the an entire
[1:41:19] family
[1:41:21] don't tell me that when God speaks
[1:41:23] something that God isn't going to back
[1:41:25] it up you can argue with the promise but
[1:41:30] when it's a possession there's no devil
[1:41:33] sister Whitney that can rob it away from
[1:41:37] you let the distractions come but don't
[1:41:40] you get bombarded and get your mind off
[1:41:43] of what God's
[1:41:49] doing what is he trying to do what's
[1:41:52] Satan trying to do if I was a devil if I
[1:41:55] was a devil I'd try to keep you off this
[1:41:57] land I'd tried to keep you from being
[1:42:00] positive I tried to keep you under that
[1:42:02] depression I tried to keep that keep you
[1:42:05] thinking that you're not good enough to
[1:42:06] go in
[1:42:08] there that's that's what I'd do if I was
[1:42:10] devil I'd try to keep you at arm length
[1:42:12] try to put you a Derrick Henry stiff arm
[1:42:14] on you and keep your way out there say
[1:42:16] no you ain't coming in here that's
[1:42:18] exactly what I'd do if I was a devil but
[1:42:20] if I was God I would say to you brother
[1:42:22] Chris everything that you have need of I
[1:42:25] give it to thee in the name of Jesus
[1:42:27] Christ so I know what side I'm going to
[1:42:30] stand on I'm not fighting against a God
[1:42:33] that's trying to keep me away from all
[1:42:35] the
[1:42:41] blessings what is it it's a gift and it
[1:42:45] matters who's giving
[1:42:49] it dismiss the the devil you have every
[1:42:52] right to leave just now get out of here
[1:42:55] get out of this place get out of my mind
[1:42:58] get out of my family get out of my joy
[1:43:00] get out of my possessions get out of my
[1:43:02] business get out of here dismiss the
[1:43:08] devil that's what Abraham had to do he
[1:43:12] had to dismiss the fact that it couldn't
[1:43:15] be on the Hagar that it had to come
[1:43:17] forth through
[1:43:19] Sarah
[1:43:21] bye bye go on leave it's mine that's my
[1:43:36] joy if a devil would come in here and
[1:43:39] tell you not to praise the Lord you know
[1:43:41] it's a devil because God will never stop
[1:43:44] you from praising him if a devil come in
[1:43:47] here and told you to be silent and not
[1:43:50] to a amen the word You' know it was a
[1:43:59] devil I'm
[1:44:05] done I'm sick and tired of the devil
[1:44:07] staying on my
[1:44:10] property when I know it's
[1:44:15] mine go on go on if you don't want to
[1:44:20] see me living here if you don't want to
[1:44:22] see me living over here in my land don't
[1:44:25] come
[1:44:25] around brother bandam would sit there
[1:44:27] and said now devil said if you want to
[1:44:30] watch me Worship the Lord you just stick
[1:44:32] around here a little while he said I
[1:44:34] kept on praising the Lord and the devil
[1:44:36] got so mad that he had to leave so if
[1:44:38] the devil wants to sit around and say
[1:44:40] that he's going to watch me move in my
[1:44:42] inheritance and claim what's rightfully
[1:44:44] mine as the Rapture as the baptism of
[1:44:46] the Holy Ghost and all of these
[1:44:48] beneficial beneficial blessings then
[1:44:50] he's going to have to stand back and
[1:44:52] watch me praise the
[1:45:02] Lord now some people get praised
[1:45:04] confused and they think it's just a
[1:45:08] sound but it's
[1:45:10] wrong do you know I'm way you forgive me
[1:45:15] when I get to it there in in part
[1:45:18] 44 I can't even get out of Joshua 1
[1:45:22] but when they were walking around there
[1:45:24] 6 days they were still praising the Lord
[1:45:27] and it didn't even make a
[1:45:30] sound well what is praise brother Andrew
[1:45:33] it's perfectly lining yourself up with
[1:45:35] the word of
[1:45:37] God and turning around and thanking him
[1:45:40] for what he's about to
[1:45:43] do sometimes you just got to lift your
[1:45:45] hand sometimes you just got to whisper a
[1:45:47] prayer sometimes you just got to you
[1:45:50] just got got to believe it from your
[1:45:55] heart some people think it's just the
[1:45:57] moving of the spirit when the voices
[1:46:00] people begin to raise their
[1:46:02] voice then all of a sudden God releases
[1:46:05] himself when everybody raises his voice
[1:46:07] that's not
[1:46:08] it it's the spirit that's already came
[1:46:12] that's made you lift your
[1:46:14] voice don't you understand this is his
[1:46:16] love to you that he comes sweeping down
[1:46:19] through your life
[1:46:22] why could you not lift your
[1:46:24] voice why could you not praise him why
[1:46:27] could you not when he would choose to
[1:46:28] come
[1:46:29] down and line it out said look
[1:46:34] here look here on this
[1:46:38] day on this day on March the 5th I'm
[1:46:40] going to give you a
[1:46:42] son and he's going to be a son and he's
[1:46:45] going to be a
[1:46:46] protector and Satan is going to battle
[1:46:49] him and he's going to fight against him
[1:46:52] and try to destroy him he's going to try
[1:46:55] to corrupt his eyes he's going to try to
[1:46:57] corrupt his corrupt his his
[1:47:00] life but this is
[1:47:02] yours this is
[1:47:06] yours and it was a
[1:47:08] mama I said that's my son she identified
[1:47:12] that that's my
[1:47:14] Matthew and when Satan came in to steal
[1:47:17] her inheritance there was a mama that
[1:47:20] had a token I said that's
[1:47:22] mine how many are sitting here because
[1:47:25] of a
[1:47:26] mama that refused to give
[1:47:30] up how many are sitting here because of
[1:47:33] a
[1:47:34] daddy but you're all sitting here
[1:47:37] because
[1:47:41] God when he stretched out his arms when
[1:47:44] he stretched out his arm said oh no you
[1:47:47] can't keep me from getting to them you
[1:47:49] can't keep keep me you can't keep my
[1:47:51] hands down you can't stop me from doing
[1:47:57] this yes so he reached
[1:48:01] out and he allowed them to tack his
[1:48:04] hands and his arms and his
[1:48:06] feet to make sure that his hands would
[1:48:10] not go down in De feat but they would
[1:48:12] stay up in
[1:48:16] Victory God has lined out your
[1:48:19] life you're predestinated not to
[1:48:23] fall you're anointed by accepting what
[1:48:26] Eve turned
[1:48:30] down he stood up and lifted his hands
[1:48:32] towards heaven and swore by himself I'm
[1:48:35] not going to hold these things back no
[1:48:38] more that's why Satan is trying to
[1:48:41] distract you from what really is
[1:48:45] happening let's stand you're already
[1:48:49] standing
[1:49:01] oh
[1:49:04] Lord
[1:49:06] father we're your
[1:49:10] children Lord and we've moved into our
[1:49:12] promises oh
[1:49:14] God we recognize who we are as Sons and
[1:49:16] Daughters of
[1:49:18] God that what we have rightfully been
[1:49:21] placed in our hands is everything that
[1:49:24] we have need of to go in and possess our
[1:49:28] inheritance father there's there's lost
[1:49:30] loved ones out there that we're
[1:49:32] claiming there's beneficial blessings
[1:49:36] out there that are laying over top of
[1:49:37] our
[1:49:38] family that we are
[1:49:40] claiming there's there's things there
[1:49:43] father in our future that we don't even
[1:49:46] maybe don't even understand how it's
[1:49:47] going to come but Lord we're laying a
[1:49:49] caim name on
[1:49:51] that Lord we're predestinated for this a
[1:49:55] prophet said the move is on for the
[1:49:57] bride that there's coming a time and I
[1:49:59] see her out there on the road that there
[1:50:01] will be a Church of the Living God
[1:50:03] that'll raise and stand up to its feet
[1:50:05] and rise to its full
[1:50:08] position when the church knows who she
[1:50:10] is then the Rapture will
[1:50:13] go Lord I believe with everything that's
[1:50:16] within us that that bride is on Earth
[1:50:18] right now
[1:50:20] but Lord while we're here may we apply
[1:50:23] the token like Rahab may we get our
[1:50:26] loved one in may we get our father may
[1:50:27] we get our brother may we may we do
[1:50:29] everything that we can under the
[1:50:32] Fulfillment of this message and say
[1:50:34] that's rightfully mine now God I commit
[1:50:38] this service to you and everything
[1:50:41] that's been done and said For Your
[1:50:43] Glory may you begin to watch your
[1:50:47] children rise and possess their
[1:50:49] inheritance
[1:50:51] in Jesus name amen and
[1:50:57] amen
