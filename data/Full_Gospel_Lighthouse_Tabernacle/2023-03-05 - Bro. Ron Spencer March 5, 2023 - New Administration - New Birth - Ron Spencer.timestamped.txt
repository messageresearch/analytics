[1:05:24] that will take place and God has the

[1:05:30] thankful that Angels watch over us and
[1:05:33] amen
[1:05:35] he's good to us didn't he amen today I
[1:05:39] know there's a lot of birthdays in the
[1:05:40] room but today is Matthew's birthday
[1:05:54] I was thinking over it as I Was
[1:05:56] preparing and
[1:05:57] and you know I I don't know if I've ever
[1:05:59] preached on a Sunday on your birthday of
[1:06:02] late and so
[1:06:04] I am honored to to just say how proud I
[1:06:07] am of Matthew of course I'm proud of all
[1:06:10] my family but I'm really proud that
[1:06:11] Matthew has stepped to the plate he's a
[1:06:15] real man
[1:06:16] now brother Homer was telling us one
[1:06:18] time he's we were in the car
[1:06:21] and we were going down the road and we
[1:06:24] were getting ready to have a celebration
[1:06:25] because Matthew had became a police
[1:06:27] officer
[1:06:29] and so we're we're getting off of the
[1:06:31] exit and he said you know Matthew is a
[1:06:33] real man
[1:06:35] yes he is he said you know I remember
[1:06:37] when I became a real man
[1:06:40] he said you know I I was a real man he
[1:06:43] said now Matthew's a real man
[1:06:45] so he made a few more comments and
[1:06:48] I said brother Homer I said do you ever
[1:06:51] think that me and Andrew will become a
[1:06:53] real man he said no I I don't think
[1:06:57] you'll ever be
[1:07:11] for those that didn't know him he'd just
[1:07:13] tell you exactly what he had on his mind
[1:07:14] and so
[1:07:16] I don't know what the qualifications was
[1:07:18] to become a real man but Matthew made it
[1:07:25] so we appreciate him as a mentor in this
[1:07:28] church
[1:07:29] a real example
[1:07:31] he's my firstborn son so he gets many
[1:07:35] blessings and
[1:07:36] and
[1:07:38] you know many years ago now what maybe
[1:07:40] 15 years ago
[1:07:42] we were in a fire together
[1:07:45] how many
[1:07:48] 17 years ago yeah
[1:07:52] 16 years ago
[1:07:54] amen
[1:07:55] and so we were in a fire together an
[1:07:58] explosion of Propane and Gas
[1:08:01] and Matthew
[1:08:04] jumped in selflessly and saved my life
[1:08:08] I wouldn't be here today if Matthew had
[1:08:11] not have done that act of courage and
[1:08:14] strength and he you know I I heard
[1:08:17] somebody was in here with a black jacket
[1:08:19] and blue jeans
[1:08:21] and I want to say this to you I'd borrow
[1:08:23] that today if I could so
[1:08:26] Matthew I was I was in bib overhauls
[1:08:29] and
[1:08:30] and it was a rainy night and it wouldn't
[1:08:33] fire and finally get fired and and the
[1:08:35] explosion took place and
[1:08:37] and just wall of fire that was there but
[1:08:40] Matthew grabbed me by my bib overhauls
[1:08:43] actually jerked his shoulder out of
[1:08:45] place
[1:08:46] but he saved my life and I have great he
[1:08:50] is a hero to me and we've had a lot of
[1:08:52] precious moments and a lot of incredible
[1:08:55] times together and and uh this this year
[1:08:58] in in October I was able to hunt with
[1:09:01] him
[1:09:02] and uh I was able to watch him kill a
[1:09:05] monster deer
[1:09:06] and I was I was I was texting him and
[1:09:09] saying there's a monster deer in your
[1:09:11] lap a monster deer in your lap and then
[1:09:13] all of a sudden I saw the arrow leave
[1:09:16] and he got it
[1:09:18] and I think I was happier than he was
[1:09:21] and so I was definitely breathing hard
[1:09:23] and I I was thrilled with him and he's
[1:09:26] got a wonderful family and wonderful
[1:09:29] children and they're growing up and the
[1:09:31] fear in an admonition of the Lord and
[1:09:33] and how great that is and we you know I
[1:09:36] just have to say this message works
[1:09:39] it just works and so we thank the Lord
[1:09:46] all right
[1:09:48] happy birthday

[1:11:13] the trip again this week I believe
[1:11:15] they're starting to like some things
[1:11:16] here and so amen thank you thank you for
[1:11:20] for being here well Andrew preached most
[1:11:23] of my sermon last night so I I thought
[1:11:25] about just getting up and saying ditto
[1:11:30] dismissing and going eating dinner but
[1:11:34] wasn't that wonderful last night
[1:11:37] all right
[1:11:45] so maybe we'll just start again and you
[1:11:48] act like you didn't hear anything so if
[1:11:51] you will be a very receptive audience
[1:11:52] and caring and loving me we'll just kind
[1:11:56] of work through it and we'll get to some
[1:11:58] new part
[1:11:59] amen let's stand to our feet this this
[1:12:01] morning
[1:12:02] if you will turn with me into Genesis
[1:12:05] chapter 29 and verse 17 I would like to
[1:12:08] speak on new Administration
[1:12:13] and today I'd like to speak on the new
[1:12:15] birth in the new Administration so
[1:12:19] Old Man passed away and the new man is
[1:12:21] born again and so I'd like to take a
[1:12:24] couple of different thoughts with this
[1:12:25] and maybe turn the diamond a little bit
[1:12:29] maybe you'll find yourself somewhere in
[1:12:31] this book
[1:12:33] amen I'm sure you will amen Genesis
[1:12:36] chapter 29 and verse 17.
[1:12:43] think about Moses having to write some
[1:12:45] of these things
[1:12:49] Leah
[1:12:51] was tender eyed
[1:12:55] but Rachel was beautiful
[1:12:59] and well favored
[1:13:02] Genesis 29 and verse 31.
[1:13:06] and when the Lord saw that Leo was hated
[1:13:10] what a statement
[1:13:12] when the Lord saw that Leah
[1:13:15] was hated
[1:13:17] he opened her womb
[1:13:20] but Rachel was barren
[1:13:23] and Leah conceived and bear a son and
[1:13:26] she called his name Reuben there you are
[1:13:29] in the scripture
[1:13:31] for she said
[1:13:33] surely the Lord hath looked upon my
[1:13:36] affliction
[1:13:37] now therefore my husband will love me
[1:13:42] and she conceived again and bear a son
[1:13:45] and and said because the Lord hath heard
[1:13:49] that I was hated
[1:13:52] he hath therefore given me this son also
[1:13:57] and she called his name
[1:13:59] Simeon
[1:14:01] and she conceived again and bear a son
[1:14:04] and said now this time will my husband
[1:14:08] be joined unto me because I have borne
[1:14:12] him three sons
[1:14:15] therefore was his name called Levi
[1:14:20] every one of these boys are important in
[1:14:23] the scriptures
[1:14:24] and she conceived again and bear a son
[1:14:29] and she said after all the hate all the
[1:14:33] scorn
[1:14:34] now notice this now will I praise the
[1:14:38] Lord
[1:14:39] therefore she called his name Judah and
[1:14:44] left bearing
[1:14:46] may the Lord add the blessing to the
[1:14:48] word you can be seated
[1:14:56] if you remember the story of Jacob
[1:15:00] he was a con artist
[1:15:03] he was a Deceiver
[1:15:06] none of us would have picked him
[1:15:10] but God did
[1:15:15] it's easy to observe or hear how Jacob
[1:15:18] was paid back
[1:15:20] for his own deceits
[1:15:23] he was given Leah the tender-eyed
[1:15:27] cross-eyed
[1:15:29] ugly one
[1:15:31] he was after Rachel the beautiful one
[1:15:36] but he had a father-in-law
[1:15:39] he had cheated his own father
[1:15:42] he had cheated Esau
[1:15:45] but now it's going to come back to him
[1:15:48] you live long enough things seem to come
[1:15:51] back
[1:15:52] and now his father-in-law cheated him
[1:15:57] now you would think out of all of this
[1:16:00] all of this turmoil
[1:16:03] this girl is married to a guy that don't
[1:16:07] love her
[1:16:08] to a guy that disdains her
[1:16:12] to a guy that's made fun of her to a guy
[1:16:14] that wanted to marry the sister but
[1:16:17] she's placed in the bed
[1:16:20] and she begins to have children thinking
[1:16:23] that by having his children he will love
[1:16:26] her
[1:16:27] never does she find the love of Harmony
[1:16:30] of marriage
[1:16:32] with particular Jacob
[1:16:35] but she does find her name written in
[1:16:39] the book of Lamb's Book of Life for
[1:16:42] bearing some of the most important boys
[1:16:45] in the Earth
[1:16:48] I want you to just notice this last boy
[1:16:50] she when she names him now I will praise
[1:16:55] the Lord
[1:16:56] she lifted her eyes and her heart way
[1:17:00] above all of her her troubles all of her
[1:17:04] anguish all of the hate that had been in
[1:17:07] her life
[1:17:09] and she names this boy Judah
[1:17:13] this boy will be of ultimate importance
[1:17:16] because of the scripture Jesus
[1:17:19] the Messiah will come from his lineage
[1:17:26] from the hated woman
[1:17:28] from the woman that was ugly
[1:17:31] from the woman that was disdained from
[1:17:34] the woman that was done wrong most of
[1:17:37] her life
[1:17:39] she will name her last son Judah and she
[1:17:43] begins to praise God even in this
[1:17:46] horrible condition my life has changed
[1:17:54] maybe you think in your life
[1:17:58] in your life you've been done wrong
[1:18:01] your life has been wrapped with
[1:18:03] circumstances that you couldn't help
[1:18:06] but I want you to remember this God is
[1:18:10] not shy about where he finds his
[1:18:13] children
[1:18:15] he's not ashamed to go to a well
[1:18:20] he's not ashamed to go to a graveyard
[1:18:25] he knows where you're at
[1:18:28] now let's just think about the lineage
[1:18:30] of our family Noah was a drunk
[1:18:36] Abraham was too old
[1:18:39] Jacob was a liar
[1:18:42] Leo was ugly

[1:20:17] excuses of the Bible and God overrides
[1:20:20] all the excuses
[1:20:24] to give you a new Administration in your
[1:20:26] life if you're only looking at your
[1:20:29] Humanity you're missing the whole
[1:20:31] picture
[1:20:33] now we just mentioned the woman is the
[1:20:36] well Jesus was not ashamed of her
[1:20:40] he was not ashamed that she had five
[1:20:42] husbands
[1:20:43] and she's living with another man
[1:20:48] if she'd had 16 that would have never
[1:20:51] settled her trouble
[1:20:53] but Jesus was the man that she needed in
[1:20:57] her life
[1:20:59] maybe Jesus is the man that you need in
[1:21:03] your life in your despair in your
[1:21:06] discouragements
[1:21:08] maybe you've wrote You've wrote in your

[1:21:13] you've wrote a lot of Horrors and scars
[1:21:17] and a lot of things that has been
[1:21:19] written in your life until Jesus came
[1:21:25] Jesus responds to the woman at the well
[1:21:27] he says
[1:21:29] if thou newest
[1:21:32] the gift of God and who is that that
[1:21:36] saith to thee give me to drink
[1:21:40] thou would have asked of him
[1:21:43] and he would have given thee
[1:21:46] Living Water
[1:21:51] he could have just simply said if you
[1:21:53] knew who I was
[1:21:54] you would know that I have the Cure
[1:22:02] if you knew who I was you would
[1:22:05] recognize that I have the chore
[1:22:08] how many people have walked in in a lot
[1:22:11] of trouble generally God finds his
[1:22:13] children in trouble
[1:22:15] but if you walk into a service and you
[1:22:17] realize that Jesus is here
[1:22:22] and he has to cure to your problems
[1:22:27] even as Christians we come up against
[1:22:30] obstacles in our life
[1:22:32] great difficulties in her life Jesus has
[1:22:36] the cure to your issues he has secured
[1:22:39] to your marriage problems he has secures
[1:22:42] to your family situation he has secured

[1:22:52] attitude he has secured
[1:22:56] to your Moody situations he has the
[1:23:00] awesome a cure to your whole life
[1:23:05] and the Lord said unto Simon
[1:23:09] Simon
[1:23:10] behold Satan
[1:23:12] hath the desire to that he may sift you
[1:23:16] as wheat
[1:23:17] but I have prayed for thee aren't you
[1:23:20] glad that Jesus is still praying for you
[1:23:24] he's still making intercession for you I
[1:23:28] have prayed for thee that thy faith
[1:23:30] failed not and when thou art converted
[1:23:35] strengthen thy Brethren think about this
[1:23:38] Peter could have turned around to Jesus
[1:23:41] said have I not been with you three and
[1:23:44] a half years I left my family I left my
[1:23:47] home I left my fishing business I left
[1:23:50] all of that
[1:23:52] amen and you're telling me that I'm not
[1:23:55] even converted yet
[1:23:58] I believe you're the Messiah I told you
[1:24:00] just the other day that thou art the
[1:24:02] Messiah the Son of the Living God and
[1:24:05] you gave me the Keys of the Kingdom he
[1:24:08] didn't realize he was right before the
[1:24:11] trial of his life
[1:24:13] and Jesus is telling him in spite of all
[1:24:16] of his Brokenness he was telling him I
[1:24:20] have prayed for you
[1:24:22] and when you're converted which is when
[1:24:24] you receive the Holy Ghost when you're
[1:24:26] at converted strengthen the brethren
[1:24:34] a man's got to be convinced first
[1:24:38] and the only convincing thing that is
[1:24:41] the manifestation or the identity of the
[1:24:44] Gospel being identified
[1:24:47] and when you see that you have passed
[1:24:49] from Death unto life and it become a new
[1:24:53] creature in Christ Jesus
[1:24:55] that's the identity of the Holy Ghost
[1:24:59] how can the Holy Spirit write the Bible
[1:25:02] and turn around and deny what he wrote
[1:25:05] he cannot do it and that's the identity
[1:25:09] he said the identity of unbelief by
[1:25:12] identity of belief Jesus said these
[1:25:16] signs shall identify who believed me
[1:25:21] if you'll remember in Acts chapter 19
[1:25:25] . they asked him Paul asked him
[1:25:28] said
[1:25:30] as he passes through Corinth Paul having
[1:25:33] passed through the upper room of the
[1:25:35] coast of Ephesus and finding certain
[1:25:38] disciples he said unto them have you
[1:25:41] received the Holy Ghost since you
[1:25:44] believed
[1:25:46] more than just believing
[1:25:48] drunks on the street believe
[1:25:52] I said tooth working at night believe
[1:25:54] God
[1:25:56] but have you received the Holy Ghost
[1:25:58] which is the life of God being breathed
[1:26:01] inside of you where God seals you
[1:26:05] where the old King of the heart is dead
[1:26:08] and the old man is gone and God puts his
[1:26:12] own life his own attributes living on
[1:26:16] the inside of you
[1:26:18] the Checker station itself when your
[1:26:21] flesh wants to sin God calls and pulls
[1:26:25] on the Rings
[1:26:27] have you received the Holy Ghost since
[1:26:30] you believe and they said unto them we
[1:26:32] have not such heard of whether there be
[1:26:35] a Holy Ghost and he said unto them
[1:26:39] what were you baptized
[1:26:42] and they said unto him John's baptism
[1:26:46] they had missed the coming of Jesus
[1:26:49] Christ
[1:26:50] fulfilling the Messiah
[1:26:54] prophecy and they had missed all of that
[1:26:57] and there was under John's teachings
[1:27:02] right oh yeah are you with me now listen
[1:27:06] you can bypass your your ministry I I
[1:27:09] thought I thought how I thought how well
[1:27:12] Andrew put it last night oh we want to
[1:27:14] go back to brother Branham are we going
[1:27:16] to go back to Pentecost or we want to go
[1:27:18] back to yesteryear and missing what
[1:27:20] God's doing today
[1:27:23] we're right up on the the coming of the
[1:27:26] Lord Jesus Christ right up on the
[1:27:29] resurrection of saints right upon our
[1:27:32] body change don't look back
[1:27:36] don't look back whatever you do God
[1:27:39] built you to live in this day
[1:27:42] he didn't build you to live in another
[1:27:44] day
[1:27:46] another day is just a painted fire for
[1:27:48] today but this is our day
[1:27:54] second Corinthians chapter 5 and verse
[1:27:56] 16.
[1:27:57] Warfare hence fourth
[1:28:00] know we know man after the flesh
[1:28:04] yay that through we have known Christ
[1:28:07] after the flesh
[1:28:09] yet now henceforth know we him no more
[1:28:14] therefore notice these words if any man
[1:28:17] be in Christ
[1:28:20] he is a new creature
[1:28:24] he is operating under a new
[1:28:27] Administration
[1:28:31] you used to like you used to cheat you
[1:28:34] used to drink you used to run
[1:28:37] you used to have a certain kind of music
[1:28:39] you used to have a certain thing that
[1:28:41] you did but when Jesus came
[1:28:44] what made the difference in your life
[1:28:47] not a bunch of vowels and not I'm going
[1:28:49] to have to make myself do this but when
[1:28:51] Jesus truly comes into your life
[1:28:55] [Music]
[1:28:57] let me explain to you trying to make
[1:28:59] yourself
[1:29:01] do things it's kind of like turning the
[1:29:03] new year
[1:29:06] and you
[1:29:09] you get on the scale
[1:29:14] and you begin to make promises
[1:29:17] you pattern yourself after Hollywood and
[1:29:19] you look down at your body
[1:29:21] and you forget the scripture that you're
[1:29:24] fearfully and wonderfully made
[1:29:28] and you say I'm not gonna I'm not gonna
[1:29:31] put Donuts in there
[1:29:33] and all the Comfort foods that I I enjoy
[1:29:36] it's almost a lint
[1:29:38] I'm going to put all of these things
[1:29:40] away two weeks later
[1:29:43] take a picture put it on Facebook I'm
[1:29:46] here with a pizza this big
[1:29:49] [Applause]
[1:29:51] [Music]
[1:29:57] well I'm going to change my husband try
[1:29:59] that out
[1:30:01] try that out take your shoes off take
[1:30:03] your shoes off before you walk in this
[1:30:05] I'll take your shoes off I've heard that
[1:30:06] for 40 years take your shoes off
[1:30:12] make up your side of the bed
[1:30:14] I finally got that down
[1:30:20] shoes is still a big deal
[1:30:23] therefore If any man
[1:30:29] are you with me
[1:30:30] untie your shoes go ahead
[1:30:35] in Christ
[1:30:37] he is a new creature
[1:30:40] Paul would say it I am a prisoner of
[1:30:44] Jesus Christ
[1:30:48] not a bondage of I I'm dreading It's A
[1:30:52] Love Affair
[1:30:54] it's a love affair with Jesus Christ
[1:30:58] in Ezekiel chapter 36 and verse 26 a new
[1:31:02] heart also will I give you a new spirit
[1:31:05] will I put within you and I will I will
[1:31:08] take away the Stony heart out of your
[1:31:10] flesh and I will give you a heart of
[1:31:13] Flesh
[1:31:14] brother Brown said the reason God has to
[1:31:16] give you a new spirit
[1:31:18] because he even couldn't live with the
[1:31:20] old one
[1:31:24] and then he gives you the Holy Ghost two
[1:31:26] different events and I will put my
[1:31:28] spirit within you and cause you to walk
[1:31:30] in my statues and you shall keep my
[1:31:33] judgments and do them Romans chapter 12
[1:31:36] and verse 1 I beseech you therefore
[1:31:38] Brethren by the mercies of God that you
[1:31:41] present your bodies a Living Sacrifice
[1:31:44] holy and acceptable unto God that which
[1:31:47] is your reasonable service and be not
[1:31:49] conformed to this world but be you
[1:31:52] transformed by the renewing of your
[1:31:54] minds that you might prove what is the
[1:31:57] good and acceptable and the perfect will
[1:31:59] of God
[1:32:02] brother Branham was around some
[1:32:04] interesting individuals
[1:32:07] if I could just talk to you just for a
[1:32:09] second Bert call brother man said was
[1:32:11] the most cruel man that he ever met
[1:32:16] brother Adam never explained to him the
[1:32:18] Sabbath seal third pull the godhead
[1:32:21] water baptism
[1:32:24] he never he never explained any of that
[1:32:26] he just lived the life
[1:32:29] here was the cruelest man that he'd ever
[1:32:31] met
[1:32:33] and brother Branham just simply lived a
[1:32:36] life
[1:32:38] he just simply lived a life and it was a
[1:32:41] life that caused him to be thirsty
[1:32:44] and he led
[1:32:48] Bert call to the Lord
[1:32:52] and he said I gotta have your Jesus
[1:32:59] he found himself in a yard of an infidel
[1:33:02] and he's quite proud of being an infidel
[1:33:05] and I'm not going to tell the whole
[1:33:06] story but this man didn't believe in God
[1:33:08] actually kind of made fun of people that
[1:33:10] did believe in God
[1:33:12] but there was a predestinated seat on
[1:33:14] the inside of him a woman had got healed
[1:33:17] up on the hill he thought she was going
[1:33:19] to die
[1:33:21] they had a noise up there one morning
[1:33:23] and he didn't know the story but he went
[1:33:26] up there took the wagon getting ready to
[1:33:28] take her body down off of the off of the
[1:33:30] Hill went up there and she was healed
[1:33:33] and he heard the story about a preacher
[1:33:36] that had sent word and to and he had
[1:33:39] prayed for her and they came on and told
[1:33:42] her the results of that prayer and she
[1:33:44] got healed
[1:33:46] now this Infidel wanted to meet that
[1:33:49] preacher
[1:33:50] he didn't show up in a three-piece suit
[1:33:54] they had been hunting for a few days he
[1:33:56] had blood on his on his pants and and no
[1:33:59] doubt he looked a little bit rough in
[1:34:01] his beard brother bam when he would hunt
[1:34:02] he would he would allow his beard to
[1:34:04] grow and he probably hadn't taken a bath
[1:34:07] for a few days
[1:34:08] that don't give us a right not to take a
[1:34:10] bath every day
[1:34:12] you stink
[1:34:14] and let me just say this to you brother
[1:34:16] but I'm standing there and he didn't
[1:34:18] tell him I'm the prophet of this age he
[1:34:20] didn't tell me tell him they didn't
[1:34:21] explain no godhead or he didn't explain
[1:34:24] anything to him
[1:34:26] he picked up an apple
[1:34:29] then he said put a glass of water on the
[1:34:32] fence post
[1:34:34] this is in my notes been in my notes for
[1:34:36] a few weeks so don't don't get excited
[1:34:37] here brother Ron you're picking on me
[1:34:39] why don't you get excited about that I'm
[1:34:41] just trying to get you to live the life
[1:34:44] and so anyway it picked up a glass of
[1:34:46] water dude he asked he said I see the
[1:34:49] leaves are starting to turn here and
[1:34:50] it's August and I see they're starting
[1:34:52] to turn and and he says all right if I
[1:34:55] have an apple and he said yeah
[1:34:58] the yellow jackets are eating them up
[1:35:01] and
[1:35:04] brother Bram asked him said what
[1:35:05] intelligence
[1:35:06] is telling that tree to send it sat back
[1:35:09] down to the ground and causing those
[1:35:11] leaves
[1:35:13] to turn colors
[1:35:15] oh that's just nature
[1:35:19] you talk staring a little bit and
[1:35:22] he says uh
[1:35:24] if you can tell me what intelligence
[1:35:26] tells that tree
[1:35:28] to send it sap back down to the ground
[1:35:31] he said we haven't even had a cold
[1:35:32] morning here
[1:35:34] he said I'll tell you what intelligence
[1:35:36] told me about that woman
[1:35:38] your brother Brown
[1:35:43] now both around went hunting in Colorado
[1:35:45] most years
[1:35:49] brother Royce Shrewsbury was out there
[1:35:51] his hitch had broke on his
[1:35:54] on his uh
[1:35:56] vehicle
[1:35:58] and he had to get it welded
[1:36:01] and so the guy is uh
[1:36:03] the guy is welding on his deal and he
[1:36:05] saw his license tag West Virginia
[1:36:09] he said now isn't West Virginia close to
[1:36:12] Indiana
[1:36:14] how close is it to Jeffersonville
[1:36:17] he said well what interest do you have
[1:36:19] in Jeffersonville he said well there
[1:36:21] used to be a guy came here and he hunted
[1:36:24] every year and said
[1:36:26] it he would sit on that porch right up
[1:36:28] there at that Country Store
[1:36:30] and he would tell us Miracle after
[1:36:32] miracle and we would all sit around and
[1:36:35] listen to him talking
[1:36:38] he said sure would be nice to meet him
[1:36:42] said are you talking about William
[1:36:43] Branham

[1:36:47] he said well he's passed away he's gone
[1:36:49] now
[1:36:51] that man never heard brother Branham
[1:36:53] preach
[1:36:55] that man never never heard any of the
[1:36:57] great doctrines
[1:37:00] but a man in hunting clothes
[1:37:04] a man in hunting clothes
[1:37:09] there's a YouTube
[1:37:10] video out of brother Branham in Africa
[1:37:13] I've watched it several times and found
[1:37:16] it interesting that
[1:37:18] that he was he was with people that no
[1:37:21] doubt didn't realize who he was
[1:37:24] there's times that he's in his hunting
[1:37:26] clothes and then there's another time
[1:37:28] that he's in his in his suit and he's a
[1:37:31] little hat
[1:37:32] he's not trying to put on anything
[1:37:36] listen we're not the important one
[1:37:42] we're not the great one
[1:37:45] Jesus is the great one
[1:37:49] I love what you said last night brother
[1:37:51] random wasn't trying to draw people to
[1:37:53] himself
[1:37:55] he was wanting to get them to Jesus
[1:37:58] Christ
[1:38:00] now we know that deities not just in
[1:38:03] heaven but God wants to live in you
[1:38:06] and he so picked your Tabernacle to
[1:38:09] where he could live in God wants to use
[1:38:12] your eyes he wants to use your hands he
[1:38:15] wants to use your mouth
[1:38:19] now all of us are on a journey
[1:38:23] we're all on a journey
[1:38:26] are you with me
[1:38:27] I I I've been in business most of my
[1:38:31] life
[1:38:32] first of all I started out in the
[1:38:33] produce produce industry then I went
[1:38:36] into a grocery store and I was a I was a
[1:38:39] I was a butcher for seven years in the
[1:38:42] grocery store I would lead a couple of
[1:38:44] those people to to Jesus Christ
[1:38:47] man named Paul Harbor I led him to Jesus
[1:38:50] Christ he was one of the he was most
[1:38:53] caring guy that had ever been around and
[1:38:55] he got cancer and they burned him up
[1:38:57] with radiation
[1:38:59] and I walked into his room and he said
[1:39:01] it's the same as Jesus walking into this
[1:39:03] room to see me
[1:39:04] and that night I led him to the Lord
[1:39:07] Jesus Christ
[1:39:10] in my life I've met a lot of people
[1:39:13] you meet a lot of people in life
[1:39:15] you can't take the time to explain to
[1:39:18] him everything that you believe but if
[1:39:20] you just live it
[1:39:22] if you just create an atmosphere around
[1:39:25] you
[1:39:29] and once in a while say something
[1:39:31] that Jesus loves you and not only does
[1:39:34] he love you he loves them
[1:39:37] and before long you'll create an
[1:39:38] atmosphere to where that person will get
[1:39:40] thirsty
[1:39:42] you see we're all in a journey
[1:39:46] and let me just say this to you be very
[1:39:48] cautious
[1:39:49] you may be talking to a drunk
[1:39:53] run away
[1:39:57] predestinated seeds
[1:40:02] and where did God find you at
[1:40:05] and maybe you're you're you've got a lot
[1:40:08] of a ton of questions in your life and
[1:40:11] you may never get all those questions
[1:40:13] answered
[1:40:16] but if you fall in love with Jesus

[1:45:45] take them to a good dinner
[1:45:51] tells the story here's some time ago the
[1:45:54] religions of the world met
[1:45:57] he said this they had this lady Maccabee
[1:46:00] from Oklahoma
[1:46:02] probably where these people came from
[1:46:03] sitting on the back row
[1:46:07] they arrested her and
[1:46:11] she was running through the streets
[1:46:13] driving a stage coach
[1:46:16] smoking a cigar breaking the speed
[1:46:18] limits with a stage coach you can you
[1:46:20] can tell this story is old
[1:46:23] and all the religions in the different
[1:46:25] religions raised up and they told their
[1:46:28] part of their religion and how great it
[1:46:30] was the Muhammad priest told how great
[1:46:34] his religion was and the Buddha told how
[1:46:36] great his religion was
[1:46:38] a certain little minister
[1:46:41] was representing the religion of America
[1:46:45] Christian religion
[1:46:48] and when it got when he got his time on
[1:46:52] the platform
[1:46:53] he told the story of this great foul
[1:46:56] woman how low down that she was until
[1:46:59] even they didn't want to get her around
[1:47:02] her
[1:47:03] even get close enough to even tar and
[1:47:06] feather her
[1:47:07] she was so immoral
[1:47:10] she was so degraded
[1:47:12] there was nothing that could help her
[1:47:15] and he said gentlemen religions of this
[1:47:19] world
[1:47:20] can your religion
[1:47:23] produce anything that would cleanse her
[1:47:25] hands
[1:47:26] and and and and cleanse her vowel person
[1:47:31] and everybody just sat still
[1:47:33] right on the end of their seats no one
[1:47:36] said nothing
[1:47:37] then he jumped up in the air and
[1:47:39] screamed clipped his heels together he
[1:47:42] said the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:47:46] won't only cleanse her hands but it'll
[1:47:49] clean her heart and make her pure as a
[1:47:54] lily
[1:47:55] that blood of Jesus Christ takes away
[1:47:58] sin and cleanses us of all of our
[1:48:01] iniquity and makes us a new creature in
[1:48:04] Christ Jesus there's nothing else will
[1:48:08] do it
[1:48:12] what will wash away my sins
[1:48:15] nothing but the blood of Jesus
[1:48:18] what will make me whole again
[1:48:21] nothing but the blood of Jesus
[1:48:32] all of us make choices and leads us down
[1:48:34] roads
[1:48:36] some choices takes people to prison
[1:48:40] some choices takes people to Mental
[1:48:42] Hospitals some choices place people in
[1:48:45] horrible marriages
[1:48:52] but I made a choice
[1:48:55] one night
[1:48:57] that I never thought I'd make
[1:49:01] I felt something pulling on my life
[1:49:08] and I took some steps
[1:49:10] those steps led me to the altar
[1:49:13] I've never looked back
[1:49:17] that's been over 40 years I've never
[1:49:19] looked back I've never needed a rehab
[1:49:25] I never needed a counseling session
[1:49:28] but Jesus came into my life
[1:49:32] there's been a lot of prayer meetings
[1:49:34] where I've had to get on my knees and
[1:49:36] say I'm sorry
[1:49:39] am I talking to you now there's been a
[1:49:42] lot of times in my life that I've
[1:49:44] disappointed myself maybe disappointed
[1:49:47] my friends and I know I disappointed
[1:49:49] Jesus but he didn't throw me in the
[1:49:51] street
[1:49:53] he didn't give up on me we served the
[1:49:56] kind of God that his grace is sufficient
[1:50:01] he's not looking at the beginning he's
[1:50:04] looking at the end
[1:50:05] [Applause]
[1:50:16] sometimes we look at a ugly little bird
[1:50:19] that bird is so ugly
[1:50:22] we don't know that that bird will grow
[1:50:24] up to be one of the most beautiful swans
[1:50:26] that ever lived
[1:50:28] he looked like an ugly duckling
[1:50:31] didn't walk right
[1:50:32] feathers didn't lay right
[1:50:34] he couldn't hold his head right
[1:50:37] but after a while he begins the mature
[1:50:40] and when he matures he has an inward
[1:50:43] Beauty he didn't go to class somewhere
[1:50:46] to get it it was in him all the time

[1:51:33] that I do you do also
[1:51:38] the church has got to get to the place

[2:00:02] but three years ago on this night
[2:00:04] I want to thank everybody that came to
[2:00:06] see me in the Opera was before coven
[2:00:09] it was about 50 people in the room it
[2:00:12] was packed
[2:00:14] and the nurse told me said you got a lot
[2:00:16] of friends I said you just don't know
[2:00:19] and David came and Gabe was in a mess of
[2:00:23] his life is Sarah in the building
[2:00:26] there she is you're not up here
[2:00:33] free Sarah
[2:00:35] and Sarah
[2:00:37] I'm not telling you anything you don't
[2:00:39] know
[2:00:39] but he was a mess
[2:00:42] he's listening now
[2:00:44] he's probably telling his buddies he's
[2:00:45] talking about me
[2:00:48] Gabriel was a mess I loved him I loved
[2:00:50] him all his life
[2:00:52] but he was a mess
[2:00:54] he came I was thankful he drove a couple
[2:00:56] of hours wanted to be with me doing the
[2:00:59] surgery I wanted to tell me how much he
[2:01:01] cared
[2:01:02] that room
[2:01:04] after
[2:01:06] a long time
[2:01:07] literally
[2:01:09] was empty with just me and him
[2:01:17] he was sitting on the couch over there I
[2:01:19] was laying in the bed
[2:01:21] and I said so
[2:01:25] this room was full
[2:01:27] and now for some unknown reason this
[2:01:29] room is empty but me and you
[2:01:31] had need to have a conference with God
[2:01:36] and he just bawled
[2:01:38] and we prayed in that moment it changed
[2:01:41] his life
[2:01:44] Gabriel moved here to take care of his
[2:01:46] uncle
[2:01:47] Gable moved in my house for about a year
[2:01:50] laughs
[2:01:53] that moment changed his life
[2:01:56] you remember that moment brother Shannon
[2:01:58] that moment changed his life
[2:02:02] the old man didn't live anymore
[2:02:04] I'm sorry he wasn't in control no more
[2:02:07] look like the same house
[2:02:11] but that man didn't live no more and a
[2:02:14] new man
[2:02:16] and he began to move and God provided
[2:02:18] for him a house
[2:02:20] complete Miracle God provided him for
[2:02:23] him a house
[2:02:24] and he moved into that house
[2:02:27] and then then after living with me then
[2:02:30] he got in that house and
[2:02:34] and I you know I told him about Sarah
[2:02:38] the same day that I told him about Sarah
[2:02:42] Queen B and Sarah show up at my house
[2:02:45] he sat beside of me in the in the Lazy
[2:02:48] Boy two different lazy boys
[2:02:55] that wouldn't look good that ain't a
[2:02:56] good mental picture
[2:03:07] Sarah sits down in the in the floor
[2:03:09] playing with the babies
[2:03:14] and I look over and Gabriel's God
[2:03:17] and I'm thinking this ain't a good time
[2:03:19] to be gone
[2:03:21] I need you here I need you to interact
[2:03:25] later I asked him I said what what in
[2:03:28] the world did you go

[2:03:35] I knew it was on
[2:03:37] I knew it was on like Donkey Kong I knew

[2:08:43] the one that breaks the cycle in my
[2:08:45] family
