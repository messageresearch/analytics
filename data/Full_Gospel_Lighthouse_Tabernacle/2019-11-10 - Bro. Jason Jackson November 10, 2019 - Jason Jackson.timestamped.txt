[1:48] Mary's knowed each other ever since we
[1:50] were little kids so we grew up at the
[1:53] same place in the same church and and so
[1:56] we we have a lot of a lot of memories
[1:58] and a lot of things in common as far as
[2:00] that goes and we're certainly you tell
[2:02] brother Chris I said hello if you would
[2:04] please if you have your Bibles tonight
[2:07] I'd like to turn to the First Samuel
[2:09] chapter 17 and while you're turning I'd
[2:15] like to kind of stay along the same
[2:17] direction from last night maybe and we
[2:21] know that in the
[2:22] writers revival we're gonna have to
[2:25] fight for it it's not just given to you
[2:29] on a silver platter so to speak but you
[2:31] gotta fight you've got something to do
[2:34] because we're in the greatest battle
[2:37] that's ever been fought is right now
[2:39] there is even two forces tonight working
[2:42] in this building and in your mind and
[2:45] this is your time to decide who's gonna
[2:49] win the battle
[2:51] amen there's gonna be a showdown there's
[2:58] gonna be those who's going to oppose the
[3:00] bride's revival there's gonna be some
[3:03] that don't understand they were maybe
[3:05] born back years ago maybe they've not
[3:08] caught up with the revelation of the
[3:09] hour or whatever it may be but there's
[3:11] gonna be some who's gonna try to stop it
[3:14] but what God has started no man can put
[3:17] it out amen
[3:20] you please bear with me tonight is you
[3:23] bout cause me to lose my voice last
[3:25] night and I thank you for that because
[3:28] it was such a privilege to preach to you
[3:29] it and we'll blame it on the weather
[3:32] First Samuel chapter 17 verse 44 and the
[3:36] Philistine said to David come to me and
[3:40] I will give thy flesh into the fowls of
[3:43] the air and to the beasts of the field
[3:47] then David said to the Philistine
[3:51] David's going to speak now comes to me
[3:54] with a sword and with a spear and with a
[3:57] shield but I come to thee in the name of
[4:00] the Lord of hosts the god of the armies
[4:03] of Israel whom thou hast defiled and
[4:07] this day well the Lord delivered thee
[4:10] into my hand and I will smite thee and
[4:15] take thine head from thee and I will
[4:18] give the carcass carcasses of the air of
[4:21] the hosts of the four listening this day
[4:24] unto the fowls of the air into the wild
[4:27] beasts of the earth that all the Earth
[4:29] may know that there is a God in Israel
[4:32] and all this
[4:35] assembly this is you shall know that the
[4:41] Lord save it not with sword and spear
[4:43] for the battle is the Lord's and He will
[4:49] give it unto your hands may the Lord
[4:52] that is blessing this evening you can be
[4:53] seated this is where the rubber meets
[5:01] the road this is a great showdown that's
[5:06] happening we can look at it as well it
[5:09] was just a Bible story of David and
[5:11] Goliath but it's more than just a Bible
[5:14] story this is something that is
[5:16] happening in our time right now there is
[5:19] a showdown there is a battle for what is
[5:22] right and what is wrong there is a
[5:24] battle for this brides revival that we
[5:27] Abed him and David said this battle is
[5:31] the Lord's battle it wasn't David's but
[5:34] I don't even though David could say this
[5:36] day I will smite thee and the Lord will
[5:39] deliver thee into my hand now we can
[5:43] learn a lot from this passage of
[5:44] Scripture if we would study it because
[5:48] we will learn that Satan is always a
[5:51] boaster he's always throwing out boast
[5:55] and he's always telling you how good he
[5:58] is and how strong he is and is always
[6:02] telling you how a weak you are how I'm
[6:05] worthy you are how worthless you are but
[6:09] let me just tell you something when the
[6:11] enemy comes and begins to tell you how
[6:13] worthless you are and how useless you
[6:15] are you need to tell the devil I must be
[6:19] a threat to you otherwise you wouldn't
[6:22] be telling me these things and rest
[6:27] assured if the devil's got his mouth
[6:29] moving he's lying to you there will be a
[6:33] lie come from somewhere when he speaks
[6:36] to you
[6:37] I might as well get rid of this I ain't
[6:43] been able to preacher pulling those on
[6:45] but maybe once or twice in my life and
[6:47] tonight ain't gonna be the night he also
[6:53] be better than the Lord side he wants to
[6:55] always put you down he wants to always
[6:57] beat you down but that's when you must
[7:00] have confidence in who you are you have
[7:03] been preached who have been told by for
[7:05] a weeks now from brother Andrew I had no
[7:08] idea what brother Andrew had been
[7:09] preaching on Eagles and and upon your
[7:11] anointing and how you were placed in
[7:13] things but God has a way of
[7:14] orchestrating things and God is able to
[7:18] orchestrate things so that you would be
[7:21] able to have confidence and who you are
[7:23] to be prepared for the battle that lays
[7:26] ahead so Satan wants to be a boaster he
[7:32] wants to have a better Kingdom than that
[7:33] of my colon and we know that he was cast
[7:35] down out of heaven he took a lot of the
[7:38] Angels with him and he started building
[7:40] his own kingdom well we could preach on
[7:44] that for a while
[7:45] kingdom builders such as Absalom
[7:49] that's a whole no this message such as
[7:51] stay over but Goliath now he exhibited
[7:56] the very characteristics of his master
[8:01] David exhibited a very characteristics
[8:04] of his master you will exhibit the very
[8:09] characteristics of your master
[8:12] whoever you service who you will exhibit
[8:15] the character richness of if you serve
[8:17] the Lord listen you can't serve both God
[8:19] and man you have to choose you this day
[8:21] whom you're gonna serve you either serve
[8:24] God or the devil
[8:29] cuz there's two forces doesn't come
[8:31] together tonight but I said how do you
[8:33] know two forces come together cuz you
[8:35] came here I came here God come here and
[8:38] the devil come here and the devil is one
[8:41] of the most faithful members of gospel
[8:44] life Tanner I'll just tell you I'll
[8:48] include my church he's the most faithful
[8:50] member to Christian Tabernacles ooo he's
[8:53] there every time the doors are open you
[8:57] rest assured he's gonna be there and
[8:59] he's here right now and right now he's
[9:03] warring and some of our minds he's a
[9:05] week we got battles going over thinking
[9:07] about what school we're gonna do
[9:08] tomorrow we're thinking about what we
[9:10] went through last week and God trying to
[9:13] get us the night to rise above what we
[9:15] have been living in and later Asiya
[9:18] he's trying to get our attention on the
[9:21] heavenlies that's why he sent you a
[9:24] bride revival that's why the prophet of
[9:26] god told us in the last days that a
[9:28] revival would come but it would be after
[9:31] the opening of the word and he said
[9:36] it'll be a quick short work I believe
[9:42] that's what's happening now we don't
[9:45] understand necessarily what the
[9:47] quicksort work of me or how how long
[9:49] it'll be because in the mind of God and
[9:51] God's time things are a lot different
[9:53] than our time but we do realize that
[9:56] we're in a battle right now what
[10:00] actually inspired this thought is when I
[10:05] watch sister Elena's testimony I watch
[10:07] part of it and she read the quote out of
[10:11] the greatest battle ever fault and she
[10:14] sit and she read this quote Satan's
[10:16] following you along that great big
[10:20] kingly priestly Goliath trying to scare
[10:25] the lever out of you he's right
[10:31] but God
[10:34] see the devil can put forth his most
[10:36] brother album but God said God said
[10:40] there's going to be a mighty or me God
[10:42] said you're going to be an invincible
[10:44] ornament God said you're gonna overcook
[10:47] God said these things and if God said it
[10:50] gotta back it up if you'd allow me just
[11:01] Kelly lady just a little bit of a
[11:03] foundation here about Goliath we want to
[11:06] size up our enemy let's look just for a
[11:09] moment at how big Goliath actually was
[11:14] from the measurements in the scripture
[11:16] he would have been conservatively nine
[11:19] foot three inches tall
[11:22] that's conservatively the average male
[11:25] in America is five foot ten hey tall her
[11:32] new buddy your compared to
[11:35] Goliath and your tall boy now the size
[11:41] of his armor says was it costed coke
[11:44] weight five thousand shekels of bronze
[11:46] he carried a spear or javelin that and
[11:50] that was as thick as a Weaver's being
[11:51] which would have been about two or
[11:52] two-and-a-half inches in diameter
[11:55] the kind of spear he had was made of
[11:58] iron and weighed six hundred shouts now
[12:01] I safe to say that Goliath his
[12:03] protective coating in u.s. pounds was
[12:06] somewhere between seventy eight pounds
[12:08] and 156 pounds they have a couple
[12:10] different estimates of what it actually
[12:13] weigh you imagine putting on the coat of
[12:16] seventy six pounds you gotta be a man
[12:20] just carry it now David's wanting to go
[12:24] up against this man and David was but a
[12:27] ruddy little feather he wasn't very big
[12:29] at home but learners match when God is
[12:33] in it
[12:35] the length of a spear was said to have
[12:38] been 26 feet two and a half inches
[12:42] around 26 feet long that head alone
[12:46] weight 17 pounds now he appeared to be
[12:51] an invincible army he appeared to be
[12:55] greater than God's God's man he appeared
[12:58] to be greater than God's people because
[13:01] God's people are scared of him but when
[13:04] David went in before Saul Saul said
[13:07] David here's what you've got to do
[13:08] you've got to put my armor oh then if I
[13:11] gotta put your armor oh wait you the one
[13:13] out there if your armor can protect me
[13:18] yellow body we don't know actually if
[13:24] David said that but it probably went
[13:26] through his mind in him it would have
[13:28] went through mine why don't you go do it
[13:34] well puts it on him weights him down he
[13:37] says you know what there's one thing
[13:38] about your armor it's not been proven
[13:42] your armors not been proven but let me
[13:45] just give you just a little bit of
[13:46] background Oh King Saul lived forever
[13:49] let me give you what happened one time a
[13:51] bear came out and another time a line
[13:54] come out and I feel fortified behind
[13:58] what I have it might not look like much
[14:01] but I have confidence listen oh brother
[14:06] Jason all we have is the Bible let me
[14:09] tell you it's not just the Bible it is
[14:11] the infallible Word of God it'll hear
[14:14] whatever devil that there's ever been
[14:18] ever David Power has to bow to the name
[14:23] of Jesus and you're fortified this
[14:28] evening with the gospel and behind the
[14:31] word of truth helmet our salvation the
[14:34] shield of faith the sword waving in your
[14:37] hand now Satan I'm coming to meet you
[14:42] nothing else has been proven but the
[14:47] word you know this brother branham when
[14:50] he goes to battle he's he's in meetings
[14:52] it was always the word that he had to
[14:56] lean on you can't lean upon a man you
[15:02] can't lean upon a gift you have to lean
[15:05] upon the word the word will never let
[15:09] you down relevance and Ruffini all the
[15:12] words of a man a man's words will fail
[15:15] you but God's words cannot fail us you
[15:26] meet me in the name of science and
[15:28] culture and everything else but David
[15:30] said I meet you in the name of the Lord
[15:32] God of Israel I'm coming after you huh
[15:37] everything has to give way to the name
[15:40] of Jesus brother I'm said death can't
[15:43] stand and I can't even stay there he
[15:45] said Satan's army brings in diseases and
[15:48] God's army is commissioned to cast them
[15:50] out every time Satan throws anything on
[15:54] you God's army is the cast him out
[15:59] what are we out of fear cast him out as
[16:04] the very technique God used only Satan's
[16:08] army uses destruction discord one-sided
[16:16] situations and he's there to destroy
[16:23] your confidence he's there to destroy
[16:26] your mind he's there to destroy
[16:28] everything in his but let me just ask
[16:31] you when the devil got into heaven and
[16:33] reasoning coming up here and all the
[16:34] things that happen what happened to him
[16:38] God cast him out once you expect us to
[16:41] do when he comes into our mind when he
[16:45] comes into me just bringing reason and
[16:46] doubt and discord and unbelief you are
[16:49] commissioned by God that
[16:52] I start taking away from you you don't
[16:54] have to live without say listen you
[16:57] don't have to live defeated you'll have
[17:00] to live oppress and depressed it you
[17:02] don't have to live with anxiety cast out
[17:09] all waste cast down the sin program says
[17:14] this he says your Buffett resurrected in
[17:17] Christ Jesus sitting in heavenly places
[17:19] and every devil is under your foot and
[17:28] he goes and if he starts to stick his
[17:30] head back up and then it went what dot
[17:34] dot dot I guess they didn't get it rest
[17:36] on the tape so I'm gonna put something
[17:39] there okay all right stop his head back
[17:42] down
[17:43] oh don't let him get it up stop it back
[17:45] now you have that commission or whatever
[17:48] demon power under your feet you have
[17:53] that authority you have that power land
[17:56] within you nothing is greater than you
[17:59] are because the work is on the inside of
[18:03] you you're dead in your life is hitting
[18:07] Christ oh god you're dead to your senses
[18:12] your daddy your conscience you have to
[18:15] be dead to your own human will dad the
[18:19] reason dad to everything and then you're
[18:23] buried with him and wherever he is
[18:28] there you are also so when a doubter
[18:33] comes into your mind do not entertain
[18:37] him
[18:38] I had somebody asked me though they
[18:42] should listen I had some bad thoughts
[18:44] come through my mind I thought surely
[18:46] with the Holy Ghost those thoughts
[18:47] wouldn't come through my mind I said the
[18:50] Holy Ghost don't keep the thoughts from
[18:51] coming do you mine but the Holy Ghost
[18:54] only inside of you will keep the
[18:56] thoughts from setting up a nest in your
[18:58] mind you don't have to let it put roots
[19:01] there
[19:02] you can't repel came for the Bible says
[19:06] resist the devil and he will flee why
[19:09] are you gonna resist him with the word
[19:12] resisting with a word get behind middle
[19:16] you're defeated ya liar keep resisting
[19:24] him buddy the only he has to that's the
[19:29] God's Word and these signs shall follow
[19:34] them that believe in my name they shook
[19:37] who is his soldiers your soldiers listen
[19:42] these are God's generals but you are
[19:46] just as important
[19:51] because what good would they be without
[19:54] you and where would you be with a live
[20:00] how could you hear unless he sent a
[20:04] preacher and how could he be reach
[20:06] unless he be sent and how could he be
[20:10] sell unless he be called a God blessed
[20:14] God has sent you a card called
[20:16] management
[20:22] in my name they shall cast out Devils
[20:26] speak with new tongues take up certain I
[20:28] read the scripture last night run this
[20:30] quoting it now
[20:31] it wouldn't harm if they lay hands on
[20:34] the sick and they shall recover RAM says
[20:37] he goes dim when the enemy comes in like
[20:38] a flood as he is today what did God say
[20:44] to do about it he said the Spirit of God
[20:47] would raise up a standard against it Oh
[20:53] Jason that standards the Bible I'll go
[20:57] with that standard - but brother Ben
[21:01] stops and he asked the question and he
[21:03] says are you one of them are you a
[21:07] standard you are to be able to stand up
[21:11] for another believer northern able to
[21:13] stand up for each other listen you are
[21:16] kings and priests unto God and a priest
[21:18] as an intercessor so you are to be able
[21:20] to go to battle for one another will the
[21:24] brothers down in battle pick him up
[21:27] [Applause]
[21:32] we're told in James 4:7 is I just quote
[21:35] resist the devil and he will flee you
[21:39] gotta hold him off by the word you can't
[21:42] hold him off by your intellectual
[21:44] thinking well if I could just think hard
[21:47] enough and I could stand on the word
[21:50] when all hell's against you stand on the
[21:54] word magician but I just love the
[21:58] presence of God hey I love the presence
[22:00] of God - I'm just gonna ask you if you
[22:06] ever been in a drought though you're
[22:12] been in a spiritual drought
[22:13] you're praying pray and pray seems like
[22:16] they're bouncing off the ceiling lord
[22:19] waeng my prayers they are but God's
[22:21] trying you
[22:23] so he ain't left you during those times
[22:25] there are those times where you think
[22:27] there's only one set of footprints and
[22:29] that's all you can see that wasn't your
[22:30] footprints that was gone carrying you
[22:33] God was picking you up and taking you
[22:36] through those piles and taking you
[22:38] through those times hallelujah he's the
[22:45] chief captain he's told us how to handle
[22:48] the word he's told us how to line up
[22:51] with his word well sometimes we see a
[22:54] child get attacked with a my goodness
[22:56] how brave that devil is will he attack
[22:58] Jesus Christ and he come to him with
[23:03] three attacks then just got ones I'm
[23:09] saying the taxi you don't just attack
[23:11] you once he'll come again and again and
[23:15] if you get the chance he'll just keep
[23:16] coming
[23:18] ro Graham said he'll attack you with a
[23:20] disease certain it'll be there and he'll
[23:24] come right back and say but the days of
[23:26] miracles are past you know and if God
[23:34] cared about you you wouldn't be in this
[23:37] condition well you know sometimes God
[23:41] allows things that happen to us just so
[23:43] he can get a testimony because how would
[23:47] you know I was a healer if he never let
[23:49] you get sick brother nd you are know how
[23:53] to experience the healing power of God
[23:55] from cancer fear not allowed you to get
[23:57] cancer now you can testify to somebody
[24:02] else
[24:03] brother hell he never want to let you
[24:05] have cancer and not be able to still you
[24:07] heal your heart disease he's that same
[24:10] Lord Jesus
[24:12] listen if God C Smith the healing God
[24:15] can do the healing
[24:17] [Applause]
[24:23] he comes at Jesus three times just be
[24:26] ready for it huh and then on the third
[24:29] attack he comes with unbelief in God's
[24:33] Word but I'm calling a wild attack he
[24:37] made on him and Jesus was the word Satan
[24:41] didn't believe for when he come to him
[24:42] he goes if thou be the Son of God he had
[24:48] a doubt there that he was the son of God
[24:50] but when he come in there I said if thou
[24:52] be the Son of God let me see a miracle
[24:54] happen let me just say something I can't
[24:59] produce miracles brother drew can't
[25:03] produce miracles brother Branham
[25:06] couldn't produce miracles Jesus Christ
[25:10] even in his own humanity could not
[25:12] perform a miracle until he first saw the
[25:15] father do it man cannot make these
[25:20] things happen it has to be the power of
[25:23] a living Lord Jesus and if Jesus was the
[25:33] word and he attacked the word bro Tom
[25:37] said Satan flew in there like a pair of
[25:38] stormtrooper fooling their own Jesus
[25:41] like he said like that and Jesus took
[25:44] the word and slashed him to pieces with
[25:47] it and he say it's Retton and Jesus said
[25:50] but it's also written cause Jesus knew
[25:54] where to take him in the word that would
[25:55] counteract Satan's attack and he
[26:01] defeated him with the word you're never
[26:06] going to defeat the devil with a
[26:12] reforming program Christian comedians
[26:20] supposed to be Christian in here John
[26:24] Christie maybe follow him please don't
[26:27] raise your hand
[26:28] I hope you don't raise it after what he
[26:32] made it to last week supposed to be a
[26:35] Christian but here he is he comes out
[26:38] and he's he's forced relationships he's
[26:42] cheated with married women he has
[26:45] completely destroyed the confidence that
[26:47] anybody had any oh yeah he's publicly
[26:50] come down and confessed it but look at
[26:52] the damage that's already been done and
[26:54] now in the day of social media he's
[26:57] toasted and he's trying to get therapy
[27:03] and well that's fine but therapy won't
[27:07] fix his problem I sink in last night if
[27:10] I could only talk to the man not that I
[27:13] could personally help him but I can take
[27:15] him the war that could help I can listen
[27:19] I'm not degrading the man for falling
[27:21] and failing and you can't expect no more
[27:23] doubt of somebody that don't have the
[27:24] Holy Ghost but we have the Holy Ghost
[27:26] today if I could party to the baptism of
[27:30] the Holy Ghost that would change his
[27:33] very desire he may want to fight the
[27:40] devil with if he could taste this Brides
[27:45] revival I think of the time brother
[27:49] Roman said if I could have just got to
[27:50] Marilyn Monroe
[27:57] but a satan can get us to disbelieve our
[28:00] weapon satan can get you to disbelieve
[28:05] your weapon
[28:06] he's already got you defeated and listen
[28:10] but greater is He that is in you than he
[28:13] that's in the world so you had to rise
[28:15] up above it and listen some things we're
[28:18] gonna battle complexes in our life
[28:24] that's part of this big old kingly
[28:26] priestly coward and the devil who put
[28:30] complexes I brother branham suffered
[28:32] with a complex he even admitted to it
[28:35] and he called out brother way and he
[28:37] said brother way had a complex and he
[28:39] resented what just now he resented what
[28:43] brother Brahim said because he thought
[28:44] brother Branham was just being mean to
[28:45] him and arrogant and brother branham was
[28:48] only trying to help him and he dropped
[28:50] dead and then he went back her and
[28:54] raised him from the dead and asked God
[28:55] to have mercy and God raised the man
[28:58] back up again see he's a merciful God so
[29:01] when we make mistakes and when we do
[29:03] falter and fail let's run the Father
[29:05] Lord I've made a mistake God I need your
[29:08] mayor say listen God didn't call you

[33:21] faults and our failures we have to get
[33:23] past those busy playing games we need a
[33:26] god who's real we need a God who
[33:29] deserves our faults in our hearts come

[33:39] a picture he'll make you he'll make you
[33:40] an offer
[33:42] he'll want to make you an offer I've had
[33:46] plenty of offers from the devil and they
[33:50] looked pretty good and then I had to
[33:51] step back and God but is that what he
[33:55] wants me to do I want to be in this
[34:00] perfect will I want to know that I know
[34:04] that I know that I'm doing what God
[34:06] wants me to do I don't want to do what
[34:09] Jason wants to do we have to get past
[34:14] those things we have to take the Word of
[34:17] God with a strong head of faith the
[34:19] two-engine sword and stand there and
[34:22] fight your enemy he said you take the

[38:14] if you're only to that base you're
[38:19] missing a whole on life you're missing
[38:22] all the message because the message
[38:25] wasn't just God sent a prophet we thank
[38:27] God for sending Malachi for we thank God
[38:30] for that but the Prophet had a message
[38:32] and his intention was for you eat let's
[38:36] to get the message you're anointed you
[38:44] called for this very day in our muscle
[38:48] problems prayer he says Lord we know

[39:23] Washington when he crossed the Delaware
[39:24] either but he was there
[39:27] haha I was there in his mind
[39:30] I remember bro many thought somebody
[39:33] went beyond the curtain of time and he's
[39:35] seen all the millions of believers there
[39:37] and he come back to the tabernacle and
[39:39] he said I've seen every what have you
[39:41] though were there he saw me I know
[39:49] people that were sitting in that service
[39:50] comes whole hallelujah I'm gonna make it
[39:51] now

[39:55] well just because you're 80 years old
[39:57] and you were sitting in the meeting
[39:58] don't mean that because I'm 42 I
[40:00] couldn't be there too but because he's
[40:03] the same yesterday today and forever
[40:04] he's not a respected person if he loved
[40:07] one you'll love the other if you meet
[40:09] God on the same ground
[40:10] listen Church you've not have know how
[40:13] to fight this devil he wants to tell you
[40:16] you're worthless he wants to tell you
[40:18] you're not good enough
[40:21] well devil I just know who i am i am the
[40:28] predestinated church in the last days i
[40:31] know that the seed has been planted on
[40:34] the inside of me i know that i'm in a
[40:36] holy spirit filled Church and i know i'm
[40:43] a seed sowed by the word of god
[40:46] and brother Ram says be careful Singh be
[40:52] careful why is he telling me to be
[40:54] careful because you recognized who you
[40:56] were
[40:57] you caught the revelation this isn't
[41:00] just Malachi for Malachi warhead and
[41:03] Luke had Luke's child movement and
[41:06] revelations 10 verses 8 through 11 then
[41:09] he was preaching knew there had to be
[41:11] some John stuff Ruben said John is
[41:15] surprised type you had to come honestly
[41:18] you have to take the books you have to
[41:20] eat the book you have to be comfortable
[41:22] this word has to be your life this is
[41:26] your revival
[41:36] hallelujah we're devil defeat or serpent
[41:42] bruisers devil don't have nothing over a
[41:50] child of God he don't have the upper
[41:54] hand even though he has studied us for
[41:56] 6,000 years you would think by now he'd
[42:00] know how to handle somebody that's
[42:04] filled with the Spirit of God now
[42:06] brother I've said he's had 6,000 years
[42:07] to study man and he knows her weaknesses
[42:10] and he knows her failures but for some
[42:11] reason he keeps missing the power in the
[42:13] blood he keeps me sent missing that the
[42:16] Holy Ghost is greater than what he is he
[42:18] keeps missing these things therefore he
[42:20] keeps attacking you and if you let him
[42:24] attack you he'll keep attacking you but
[42:26] somebody has to stand up my David and
[42:29] say enough is enough today I cover the
[42:33] name of the Lord today I'll cut your
[42:36] head off
[42:42] be careful saying you've actually just
[42:48] now got something to really praise god
[42:53] about you thought you had something to
[42:56] praise him about when you come to
[42:57] Pentecost or badness or whatever you
[43:01] might be you felt a sensation God
[43:05] changed your life you were happy right
[43:10] but now you really got something to
[43:12] praise God about it's much deeper than
[43:14] that now it's much deeper than just
[43:17] emotions you know we love emotions
[43:19] brother and said something without
[43:21] emotions is dead it ought to be buried
[43:24] but the thing is it goes much deeper now
[43:26] because now you have been anointed in
[43:29] this hour to be a giant slayer you've
[43:32] been anointed in this hour to pull your
[43:34] sword and to cut down every Goliath of
[43:37] depression ever Goliath of anxiety every
[43:40] Goliath that would come in your way you
[43:43] have
[43:43] and getting a charge and David said the
[43:46] panel is the Lord's and David didn't
[43:52] stop right there and he said and the
[43:56] Lord has given it into our hands so
[44:04] you've been equipped to defeat to death
[44:07] you know you as I said you got something
[44:10] to actually praise God for now I'm just
[44:16] going to when I grew up most of my life
[44:22] you could ask sister Mary Jane this they
[44:26] wasn't a whole lot they wouldn't none of
[44:27] this that was taboo she's back her
[44:33] laughing she knows it's true she's
[44:35] praying you don't put the camera on her
[44:39] we were told what I need don't need your
[44:42] props brother brems said I can't preach
[44:46] without brother I was getting something
[44:51] out of the service to that woman started
[44:53] screaming and then I couldn't get
[44:55] nothing out of your preaching
[44:56] if you shoot cold shivers all down my
[44:59] spine he said honey I can't preach
[45:01] without that happened I can't priests
[45:04] well I had I'm saying a man of the word
[45:06] listen church you have something to
[45:09] praise him about how because you've been
[45:11] given the full revelation now Loretta
[45:18] car
[45:19] I had a preacher tell me one time you
[45:25] said brother man may never move more
[45:26] than three foot away from this desk huh
[45:36] he was making recordings he couldn't get
[45:38] away from it except that that preacher
[45:43] didn't happen to be in Birmingham
[45:44] Alabama when brother Branham preached
[45:47] spiritual amnesia and my uncle happened
[45:48] to be there and he said for the whole
[45:51] service brother Branham paste the
[45:55] platform which was about 50 foot wide
[45:58] dragging this corded mic with him brutes
[46:01] and spiritual amnesia and it doesn't
[46:05] really matter if brother Branham did
[46:07] that or not every move through four
[46:09] three feet away it doesn't matter
[46:11] every gift is different we're not the
[46:16] pattern or live or different after the
[46:18] prophet of God there was one of those to
[46:20] an age we understand those things deep
[46:30] said well we don't need all this
[46:31] clapping they didn't clapping brother
[46:34] brems meekness what you didn't listen to
[46:35] enough tapes yet cuz I hear them when
[46:41] I'm pretty sure he probably wouldn't at
[46:43] the Baptist Church weren't even when
[46:44] they clap but he was probably over at
[46:45] the Pentecostal side over the same
[46:47] leezar over at the Church of the heart
[46:49] or something and when brother man would
[46:51] get preaching
[46:51] he'd say some boy they just go to
[46:53] clapping like crazy now go yeah what's
[46:59] gonna do with this tape but let's just
[47:02] give him the benefit of the devil let's
[47:05] just say they didn't clap they didn't
[47:07] shout and they didn't get happy let's
[47:11] look at the setting brother Branham was
[47:13] preaching it he was not preaching to
[47:17] believers like we have the opportunity
[47:20] to
[47:21] he's preaching to a group of people and
[47:23] there may be five out of a thousand that
[47:28] believe just what he's preaching and
[47:30] some of them may not really believe some
[47:35] of them might have just been along for
[47:36] the loaves and the fishes so they say
[47:39] you was right on that part that they
[47:40] didn't clap or nothing in the church but
[47:42] now they let me tell you when the word
[47:44] is being preached to believers today
[47:46] they have the freedom we're in crisis
[47:51] made me free there is Liberty I have the
[47:55] freedom the priests gone like our water
[47:57] praise God don't tell me I can't worship
[48:03] God I have a full seven-course menu for
[48:07] the seals have been revealed I got
[48:11] something to praise him about brother
[48:22] Branham was preaching the national rings
[48:23] and Baptists and pilgrims home with us
[48:25] they didn't understand what he was
[48:27] preaching about but I do I do
[48:35] so now the majority of the people we
[48:38] listen to preach to today the majority
[48:40] of them are profess to be believers well
[48:47] let's just go back and give those
[48:48] unbelievers just one tape the third seal
[48:53] bromance preaching the third seal and he
[48:56] gets down there or touch not they all in
[48:59] the one and he says well the oil is a
[49:02] type of the Holy Spirit and the lines
[49:04] are type of stimulation and all of a
[49:07] sudden you hear the crowd begin to erupt
[49:09] and relabel said that's what I'm talking
[49:12] about right there
[49:13] they got stimulated on the line and all
[49:17] of the Holy Ghost that's what we get
[49:20] stimulated oh it ain't because the
[49:22] music's beating cuz ain't no music right
[49:25] now
[49:29] you don't have to have say that's what
[49:31] they owe you you work things up alright

[49:42] well he depends on what kind you go to
[49:44] you go to football game they got
[49:46] cheerleaders trying to get you in the
[49:48] spirit you go to a baseball game too

[50:11] that the truth you own a basketball
[50:14] football game somebody throws a tussle

[50:20] language you get so excited brother

[50:26] of their last laugh that game cuz he had
[50:29] to work he said it was so cold but some

[55:06] things a little more quiet go ahead and
[55:10] preached about you last night
[55:13] intellectual theologians who only want
[55:18] to teach never have a power and
[55:27] demonstration of the Holy Ghost
[55:29] my Bible said there's all five of the
[55:32] gifts are to be in the body of Christ so
[55:36] if there's something that's teachers god
[55:37] bless them we have to have teachers but
[55:40] none say they positionally place you
[55:41] into the body but you also gotta have a
[55:43] gospel preacher that can preach the
[55:46] power of God so slow till it will
[55:48] deliver people while they're setting
[55:50] interviews listen if you ain't gotta if
[55:55] you ain't got that kind of ministry
[55:57] coming through or here something's wrong
[55:59] with the church I preached this a couple
[56:05] of weeks ago myself so you know what the
[56:06] five ministering gifts along with the
[56:09] nine spiritual gifts
[56:10] I'm putting the church to keep the
[56:13] church clean people get scared of them
[56:24] because they might get exposed well be
[56:29] like David be a man after God's own
[56:33] heart when your stands reveal with that
[56:37] it's pretty simple repent repent and
[56:42] come back to God

[57:05] rubber me Saru now he's facing the
[57:07] Goliath glasses come on boy you want

[57:27] he picks up five smooth stones brother
[57:33] Timothy just was recently your to go in
[57:36] at that brook and he picked up some
[57:38] smooth stones and he'd give me one of
[57:40] them and it was as smooth as it could be
[57:42] but it was in the shape of a triangle I
[57:46] thought that's pretty good free sharp
[57:52] punch whatever it might have been but he
[57:56] went loose of that stone it wasn't David
[57:58] strapped that place the rock there it
[58:01] was the God whom he had faith in and it
[58:05] ain't it ain't all your power it's the
[58:07] God and whom you have faith in the knife
[58:10] then I give you ever desire of your
