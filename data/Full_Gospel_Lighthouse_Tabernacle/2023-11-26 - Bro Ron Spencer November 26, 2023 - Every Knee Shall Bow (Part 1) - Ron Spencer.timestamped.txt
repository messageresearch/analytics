[54:18] you guys for being here with us in the
[54:20] house of the Lord wasn't last night
[54:24] awesome Hallelujah wasn't that
[54:35] awesome I tell you if brother Horman was
[54:38] standing near the balcony and got to
[54:40] watch because we know they get to watch
[54:42] and so I'd say he was pretty proud he
[54:44] probably did a little dancing himself
[54:46] over there amen him and brother Bill and
[54:49] my dad and all of their family going I'd
[54:51] say they really enjoyed last night's
[54:54] service service and you know this church
[54:56] was built on on worship and it's always
[55:00] been that way when it started out in a
[55:01] basement then up the other building then
[55:03] down at the house and now here it's
[55:06] always been a house of worship and I I I
[55:09] just want to reiterate to you maybe
[55:10] you're new here but we don't want this
[55:12] house to be a house of
[55:14] Thieves this is a house of worship and
[55:17] our Lighthouse goes out from it and uh
[55:20] when Jesus even rebuked them because it
[55:23] was supposed to be a house of praise and
[55:24] worship ship there and Jesus knitted a
[55:27] he knitted a a whip together and he
[55:29] whipped them and they whipped them
[55:31] because they wouldn't worship he whipped
[55:33] them because they were selling and doing
[55:35] all different kinds of things and he
[55:37] just turned over the money changers you
[55:40] know he you know he showed himself out
[55:43] just a little bit and so amen that's
[55:46] what I want this place to do I want it
[55:48] to be a worship and you know we all
[55:50] worship different some of you very quiet
[55:53] some of you are dancers some of your
[55:55] clappers some of you're dancing all over
[55:57] the place and shouting some just rais
[56:00] their hands some just clap their hands
[56:02] and and you know no matter what it is I
[56:04] want to say thank you I remember as a
[56:06] little boy beating on the back of a of a
[56:09] chair that's what made me a drummer and
[56:12] you know no matter what it is I I I I I
[56:15] just love worship it's not going to a
[56:18] man it's going to God and so there's
[56:21] many expressions of worship and you know
[56:25] I remember I remember my mother she had
[56:28] went to a special meeting and and she
[56:31] was a dancer listen if there was ever an
[56:33] angel on the earth my mother was an
[56:35] angel and she was a cheerleader when she
[56:38] was a young girl she was a beautiful
[56:40] girl and I'm not saying that because I'm
[56:42] Prejudice I'm just telling you that's a
[56:43] truth and so she was a beautiful lady
[56:46] inside and out and she rejoiced in the
[56:49] Lord she loved to have a good shout now
[56:51] and then and and so one night she was at
[56:54] a big Medan and hundreds of people were
[56:57] there and she got she got happy and she
[56:59] be to dance and one of the deacons set
[57:01] her
[57:03] down it really offended her you know she
[57:07] wasn't doing anything out of place but
[57:10] it really offended her and I said mom
[57:13] don't you worry about it I always
[57:14] settled her down now don't you worry
[57:16] about that they don't really believe the
[57:20] message they don't really believe the
[57:22] message and it wasn't no time they had
[57:24] turned into a place that didn't want
[57:26] brother brandom's message anymore now
[57:29] that building is in the hands of some
[57:31] denominational charismatic group and the
[57:34] Pastors in a little bitty building well
[57:36] when you turn against the
[57:41] message I remember a man came here and
[57:44] you know we was worshiping and we were
[57:46] we were dancing and and he told me he
[57:49] said he we we went out to eat and he
[57:51] said now I don't like that I don't I
[57:54] don't don't like that I don't believe
[57:56] that's of
[57:57] God I sat there a moment and I knew that
[58:00] wasn't the right
[58:01] spirit and after a moment brother Homer
[58:04] was with me and I said after a moment I
[58:07] said oh now I I see why you don't like
[58:10] that you got a pornographic Spirit on
[58:15] you you you were sitting there and I
[58:18] said it was last Tuesday about 4:00 in
[58:21] the evening your wife walked in and you
[58:23] barely got the computer off cuz he was
[58:26] watching
[58:27] pornography that's why you don't like

[1:03:36] read that last verse together who is the
[1:03:39] king of glory the lord of host he is the
[1:03:44] king of glory you may be seated today
[1:03:48] God bless you God bless you for being
[1:03:51] here John chap 14 and verse 6
[1:03:57] Jesus saith unto
[1:03:59] him now let's read it together I am the
[1:04:03] way the truth and the life and no man
[1:04:07] cometh unto the father but by me I want
[1:04:12] you to just notice this is very well
[1:04:14] written he is not one of the
[1:04:18] ways this is not an option
[1:04:21] here Jesus is saying it because it was
[1:04:25] the truth I am the
[1:04:27] way the truth and the life and no man
[1:04:32] cometh unto the father but by
[1:04:36] me he would be crucified for this
[1:04:40] statement but it's still the
[1:04:46] truth are you with me it is not an
[1:04:50] option he is the only way that's right
[1:04:55] he is the truth he is the
[1:04:58] life I want you to understand he is
[1:05:03] God are you with me
[1:05:06] now now Matthew chap 1 and verse 21 and
[1:05:10] and she shall bring forth a son and thou
[1:05:14] shalt call his
[1:05:17] name for he shall save his people from
[1:05:22] their sins
[1:05:25] that was his introduction to Earth by an
[1:05:27] Angel of the Lord Philippians chapter 2
[1:05:31] and verse 1 if there be any consolation
[1:05:34] in Christ any comfort in love if any
[1:05:39] Fellowship of the spirit if any bows and
[1:05:42] mercies fulfill ye my joy that ye may be
[1:05:46] likeminded having the same love being of
[1:05:50] one Accord and with one mind let nothing
[1:05:53] be done through Strife or vain Glory but
[1:05:56] in loneliness in mind and let each
[1:05:58] esteem the other other better than
[1:06:01] themselves look not every man on his own
[1:06:05] things but every man also on the things
[1:06:08] of
[1:06:09] others notice these words let this mind
[1:06:13] be in you which was also in Christ Jesus
[1:06:16] who being in the form of God thought it
[1:06:18] not robbery to be equal with God but
[1:06:21] made himself of no reputation and took
[1:06:24] upon him the form of a servant and was
[1:06:27] made in the likeness of man and being in
[1:06:29] the form of the fashion as a man he
[1:06:32] humbled himself and became obedient unto
[1:06:35] death even the death of the Cross
[1:06:38] wherefore God ha also highly exalted him
[1:06:43] and give him a name which is above every
[1:06:46] name that at the name of
[1:06:49] Jesus that at the name of Jesus every
[1:06:53] knee should bow
[1:06:54] of things in heaven and things in Earth
[1:06:56] and things under the Earth and every
[1:06:59] tongue should confess that Jesus Christ
[1:07:02] is
[1:07:03] Lord to the glory of God the Father
[1:07:07] Colossians 1 verse 15 who is the image
[1:07:11] of the invisible God the firstborn of

[1:29:29] fellows every one of the prophets all
[1:29:33] the way down through the ages of the Old

[1:38:40] those in the past and I'm going to be
[1:38:43] beat for all those in the
[1:38:47] future and I'm going to die for all

[1:50:16] the truth the life and no man cometh to
[1:50:20] the father but by
[1:50:24] me Matthew 28 and: 18 we're coming close
[1:50:27] to an in and Jesus came and spake unto
[1:50:32] them all
[1:50:35] power is given unto me in heaven and in
[1:50:39] Earth go ye therefore and teach All
[1:50:41] Nations baptizing them in the name of
[1:50:43] the father and of the son and of the
[1:50:46] Holy Ghost acts chap 2 and verse 2 5 for
[1:50:51] David speaketh concerning him I forsaw
[1:50:54] the lord always before my face for he is
[1:50:56] on my right hand that I should not be
[1:50:59] moved therefore did my heart rejoice and
[1:51:01] my tongue was glad moreover also my
[1:51:04] flesh shall Rest In Hope because thou
[1:51:07] will not suffer my Holy One thou will
[1:51:09] not leave my soul in Hell neither will
[1:51:12] thou suffer thine Holy One to see
[1:51:14] corruption for thou Hast made known to
[1:51:16] me the ways of life and thou shalt make
[1:51:20] me full of joy and with thy countenance
[1:51:23] men and
[1:51:25] Brethren let me freely speak unto you of
[1:51:29] the patriarch David that he is both dead
[1:51:31] and buried and his supper is with us
[1:51:33] unto this day therefore being a prophet
[1:51:36] and knowing that God had sworn an oath
[1:51:39] to him that the fruit of his loins
[1:51:42] according to the flesh he would raise up
[1:51:44] Christ to set on his
[1:51:46] throne he seeing this before spake of
[1:51:50] the resurrection of Christ that his soul
[1:51:54] was not left in Hell neither his flesh
[1:51:57] did see corruption Psalms chap
[1:52:02] 22 he seeing this before he spake of the
[1:52:05] resurrection of so of Christ that his
[1:52:08] soul was not left in Hell neither his
[1:52:10] flesh did seek
[1:52:11] corruption this
[1:52:16] Jesus this Jesus hath God raised up
[1:52:20] wherefore we all are witnesses therefore
[1:52:24] being by the right hand of God exalted
[1:52:27] and having received of the Father the
[1:52:29] promise of the Holy Ghost he has shed
[1:52:32] forth this which ye now see and hear for
[1:52:37] David is not ascended into Heavens but
[1:52:40] he saith himself the Lord s of my lord
[1:52:44] said unto my Lord sit thou on my right
[1:52:47] hand until I make the foes of th thy
[1:52:50] foot
[1:52:51] stol I like those words until I make thy
[1:52:55] foes thy foottoo
[1:52:58] so the enemy that is tormenting
[1:53:03] you let's read his
[1:53:07] future Satan you're coming to an
[1:53:12] end you're come un to an end well let's
[1:53:15] just predict this just a little bit we
[1:53:17] can do as good as the weather man
[1:53:21] am 177% of the time yet you get up in
[1:53:24] the
[1:53:25] morning and you what you going to be
[1:53:28] like today 70% of the time he's right
[1:53:31] think about
[1:53:34] that so here I am I'm going to kind of
[1:53:37] let let me just go out here just a
[1:53:38] little bit so it's three and a half
[1:53:40] years tribulation
[1:53:43] period three and a half
[1:53:46] years okay that's where he does all his
[1:53:49] work
[1:53:50] and and the bride's going to go in a
[1:53:53] Rapture
[1:53:54] so let's just say all right we could
[1:53:57] leave today
[1:54:01] amen so Satan better better really hope
[1:54:05] that we stay around a
[1:54:09] while he better really hope that we stay
[1:54:12] around a while cuz it's going to shorten
[1:54:14] his
[1:54:17] end over brother R don't you read the
[1:54:19] out at the end of the at the end of the
[1:54:21] Millennium he raises back up again
[1:54:23] deceives the world and yeah but he's
[1:54:25] getting close to his end
[1:54:28] there he don't have a good
[1:54:31] future but I want to tell you
[1:54:35] this you're as close to hell as you'll
[1:54:38] ever
[1:54:39] be you're as close to hell as you'll
[1:54:42] ever
[1:54:44] be Heaven is our
[1:54:47] future so we never never

[1:54:54] moved
[1:54:56] houses it's a good
[1:55:01] trade I like my future my future is
