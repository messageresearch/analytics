first john chapter 3 and verse 8. amen we so love you with all of our hearts and while we're hearing great things from oklahoma andrew glover andrew spencer you put certain chemicals together you get an explosion and so i understand that they haven't had an explosive meeting and and uh yeah if you have been able some of you've been able to see some of it and those boys are just they're they're doing really well and so we're thankful for what god's doing and i just want to admonish you whatever you do don't miss this last revival it's happening it's not going to happen it's happening it's taking place in arizona the brother temperate and brother wayne lawson is preaching and uh they're just having a phenomenal meeting that same presence is here this morning last night and we know that it's going home time uh we are very much aware we're not caught off guard we're not nervous we're not wringing our hands in a crisis now because now we're the death angels has passed by the token has taken care of us and we're like enoch we're getting ready to take some steps right into a rapture because that's what we've been called to do and this message works a man and a man amen so every service may be our last we don't know but i want to put a notice in when after the rapture takes place we're not going to be having service here they can do what they want to with the building foolish virgins can use it if they want to and i i but i want you to understand that we're going home this is what we've been preaching for this is what we've been living for amen so just step up a little higher amen god bless you amen first corinthians chapter 3 and verse eight first john chapter three and verse eight amen i hit a button a little while ago and lost all my notes so here we are amen first john chapter 3 and verse 8 he that committeth sin is of the devil for the devil sinneth from the beginning for this purpose the son of god was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil and whosoever is born of god doth not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of god in this the children of god are manifested and the children of the devil whosoever death not righteousness is not of god neither he that loveth not his brother second corinthians chapter 4 and verse 8. we are troubled on every side i love this verse yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair we're persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body the dying of the lord jesus that the life also of jesus might be manifested in our body for we which live are always delivered unto death for jesus sake that the life also of jesus might be manifest in our mortal flesh so then that's working within us but life in you we have in the same spirit of faith according as it is written i believed and therefore have i spoken and we also believe and therefore speak let's read that last verse again together we have in the same spirit of faith according as it is written i believed and therefore have i spoken we also believe and therefore speak maybe you have a need on your heart you just like to raise your hand before the lord father we love you with all of our hearts today we ask you father that you would anoint us in a very special way what an incredible time that we had here last night you're the same god this morning i ask you to anoint your servant this morning as we speak brother andrew as he's speaking in oklahoma here in just a few moments brother tim pruitt as he's speaking in arizona other ministers around the world we raise our flag we're still standing we're still believing our banner is clear we will not be defeated we're on the lord's side and may the freedom of god ring in our hearts may revival move inside of our lives regardless of the darkness of this laodicean age and the trouble on every hand god's in our in our boat i ask you that you would come and touch your children minister to us today in jesus christ's name we pray amen and amen and amen you may be seated amen the scripture says for with god nothing shall be impossible i want you to say it with the most creative part of your body your tongue because life and death is inside of your tongue are you with me full with god nothing shall be impossible anybody have trouble this week all right i got a scripture for you i want you to quote it right now into the air and let the devil hear it for with god nothing shall be impossible blue devil say it with some attitude for with god nothing shall be impossible your trouble is temporary say that with me my trouble is temporary no matter how bad your trouble is it's only temporary cancer may rail your body but the day that god chooses to take you home and graduate you from this realm to the next realm cancer loses and you step into a realm to where the cancer can never touch your body ever again [Applause] but the man says one day when adam's race was backed into a corner the law had failed the prophets had failed the judges had failed and everything that god sent to the earth had failed and adam's race stood defeated sickness among them death among them everything death horrors in every place nothing could be done but in heaven there was one that stepped out the son of god and he said this day i will give my life for adam's race what will you do cried the angels what will you do and he came to earth and he looked upon a bunch of men and women and and and that wanted to serve the lord they couldn't there was so much temptation so much sin so much sickness so much troubles on every hand they just couldn't everything had failed it looked like till he found the darkest spot of man's fear that was death it's always been and he ran in right to calvary to the thickest of the spears and throw them into his heart and cry back take what i leave you the baptism of the holy ghost and fight as you can brother i mean if there ever was a time when those disciples picked up the baptism of the holy ghost one of the mightiest weapons that's ever been given to the hands of men and they cut a hole today through sin and they defeated the devil and running him back to sickness and all of these things men wants to see heroism men are waiting for a gallant stand the world's waiting to find a man who can step out i'd say today we have an incredible hero and that's jesus there's a man in a foreign country defend democracy he has been known now as a modern day churchill uh a man that is screaming for help he's screaming for mercy he's screaming for strength he does not want to lose his own home country he does not want to see his his his people be defeated he's watching children he's watching children be destroyed i i heard a report this week that stood with me and and it's it's it's a report of the the salvation army or the red cross they picked up an entire busload of two-year-old children in the street that now has no mothers or fathers they're screaming for help countries don't know what to do because it looks like that we're on the brink of a world war it's prophesied that there is it's a sad thing to say that help no doubt is not coming in time but i want you to know as children of god let me just say when you scream you heard last night that the skies are filled with the angels of god that are fighting on your behalf and your war may look horrible by your temporary conditions but help is on the way and it's a kingdom that will never be defeated we've been in all kinds of wars throughout humanity but it's never been defeated our god has never lied he's never failed he's never lost the world [Applause] we stand with sons and daughters of god that have made a stand in their life sometimes you're challenged in your life to make a stand it's easy to stand with a thousand people but what about with you alone it's when a man stands alone in his convictions and he stands there he knows who he is he knows what he's fighting for and he's ready for the challenge now let me just remind you of who you are before the foundation of the world god had a photo album of the predestinated seed that was going to be on the earth some were chosen to live in dark ages and god equip them with the fortitude and the strength to get through the darkest of battles he chose you to live in just before laodicea just before the rapture just before at the climax's laodicea is blending it's darker than it's ever been [Music] it's darker it's more sinful it looks like the world is going into chaos and god chose you so let's remind the devil of who he's fighting let's remind him it's not our 200 my 200 pounds of flesh that's going to win this war it's not because i'm five foot five but god put something on the inside of me that he's got confidence it's not my flesh it's not my personality it's not my humanity but he put a gene seed of himself on the inside of me that even god's got confidence he put himself on the inside [Applause] not the personality of moses not the personality of jeremiah or nahum or even wesley or or brother branham they struggle with their own humanity so don't glorify no flesh you keep your eyes on jesus you keep your eyes focused on jesus whoever you are this morning you keep your eyes if you've if you've lost focus if you've got disappointed in humanity you keep your eyes on jesus he will never fail you i want to say it again to you young people he'll never fail you take courage press the battle there's no time to turn around and run our equipment in ephesians chapter six is armor for the front not for the back and when you feel like giving up and the devil's whispered in your ear you know what i'm talking about when he's whispering in your ear remember he's a liar so if he's lying to you and telling you one thing remember when he's telling you that you're backslidden and nobody loves you it just ought to tell you that you're on the right track and all of heaven is behind you the scripture tells us to be strong and with good courage remember we're believers we're god's sons we've been called to this battle there's no backing off and neither will we back down over the last couple of weeks i've been asked by doctors that are wonderful doctors how long do you want to continue this fight i'm not quitting he didn't send me to this battle for me to get in the middle of it and say i've had enough that's more than just cancer god didn't send me this far for me to throw up my hands and say i quit now it's time for a vacation let's finish this battle let's finish it if you're sitting in a ring and you're you're fighting you're the fighter and i'm your corner man and i've got my head against your head you're the one fighting but i'm trying to tell you how to whip the enemy swinging to the left and when you swinging to the left come up under him and knock his chin off we're not shadow boxing here today we're not shadow boxing with the devil just to showing how we can dance we're the lord and this war we are going to win if there's any bride that's ever been prepared we're prepared we've been given all of heaven all the word it is completely at our disposal we know who we are we're not probing we're not guessing we know where we're standing our feet's on solid rock we're not running we're not bending we're not bowing we're taking the word and chopping our way through the devil amen i don't care what we battle we have to face it may hurt and it may sting but it's worth fighting for every one of us is going to have blood on our swords we're going to have some scars but god's bigger than your scars he's bigger than your complex he's bigger than your discouraging hours be with me god is our refuge and our strength a very present help in the time of trouble 46-7 of psalms the lord of hosts is with us the god of jacob is our refuge come behold the works of the lord what desolations you have made in the earth he maketh wars to cease under the end of the earth he breaketh the bow and clutter the spear and asunder he burneth the chariot in the fire be still and know that i am god i love that be still and know that i am god i will be exalted among the heathen i will be exalted in the earth the lord of hosts is with us the god of jacob is our refuge i want to say this to you better than any president dictator prime minister and you could stack them all in this room we've got greater than all of that king jesus is with us first corinthians chapter 15 and verse 58 therefore my beloved brethren be you steadfast unmovable not like a kite on a windy night toss to and fro you work in public you see the fear that's on your your your countrymen they can feel the end is here but they haven't been sent a message to prepare them one of our favorite car salesman put his hand on the car the other day he said something big is getting ready to go on and i'd say he's right but he hasn't been given the grace and the mercy to see what you've seen but he knows something's going on brother brown said recognizing your day and its message they are screaming fast and pray thanks you're riding the fence you're waiting i'd say this you make up your mind [Applause] make up your mind there's nothing here there's not a property in the state of virginia we're staying here for there's not a car there's not a job there's no amount of money it's worth staying here for [Applause] [Music] remember this this world's not my home we build nice houses thank god for that we we drive nice cars thank god for that but all of that can be gone in a second millionaires homes was just blown to bits billionaires were just blown to bits satan is a he kills he steals he destroys he's nobody to negotiate with i say this to you sin is pleasurable for a season 10 seconds in hell will make you quick a reminder i wish i'd never went there do i need to say that again it felt like i didn't get it through sin is pleasurable for a season rock and roll make your feet dance hollywood will do all kinds of things to your emotions society will destroy your marriage your children intellectualism will take you further away from god but 10 seconds will be too long in hell run to the ark of safety ride like never before lay your excuses down and run to the cross he's still in the saving business he can save the worst sinner in the world look around he's done it he'll do it again while the door of mercy is open run to the ark of safety run but my friends they won't be your friends in hell but my clothes you'll be naked in hell everybody's humiliated in hell nobody's friends in hell party buddies here will be hating you because you blame one another for getting yourself there you influence me to go the wrong direction in life why not take good influence today turn your eyes toward jesus [Applause] popularity will not buy your lunch popularity will only make you feel good for a little while but being a trophy in hell has no merit the scripture says this you know you've heard it so many thousands of times if you've been here with me and we know that all things work together for the good to them that left god to them who are the according to his purpose not my purpose not somebody else's purpose so many times parents want to live their children's life vicariously through them and making decisions with them always marvel at parents want to pick up children's fights so 50 year old people are fighting two-year-old battles making decisions for them i didn't get to do it i want you to do it really i want to ask you is that the proper way is that the proper way in america today we have american idol people vote people want to be a part of that that deal when they win they get a contract they get a recording labels did they really win did they really win no they sold their soul sometimes young gifted young men become sports stars hitting hitting a baseball or throwing a football or or whatever lacrosse or kicking a soccer ball what are you on well maybe it's a game that you know you just push the buttons and you become the champion of the world you're the warrior of warriors you're the warrior of warriors on a couch and when you've come to the end of your road you haven't defeated one devil satan has taken your life and he stole it and he's destroyed it [Applause] and when you could have spent your time for jesus and i learned something of quality and a challenged lives and then been an influence around you that others can see the light of jesus christ [Applause] satan convinced you to live in a basement let's give myself a break here really what have you won who won who won elvis presley didn't win marilyn monroe she didn't win toward the end of the year they'll always do the the celebrities that we lost this year they didn't win it's only what you've done for jesus that's what wins see don't get your eyes on nobody in hollywood when satan took jesus up on a mountain he set him down and he began to make him offers brother branham said that he was tempted to take it that's what he said he was tempted to take it offering a kingdom without a calvary so he will offer you things that you're tempted to take jobs that take you out of church a woman or a man that has no interest in serving god i don't care if they look like clark clark gabriel for you young people go back and look that up use google for something good i don't care if they look like marilyn monroe if it takes you away from god brother ron but you guys you guys used brother branham's name well let me just say this to you if i lived in paul's day being under paul i'd call paul's name so let me just put it how it is if i lived in noah's day and i'd had a ministry i'd have been calling noah god's messenger noah preparing us to get in the ark and if you ain't in the ark you're going to miss it and water's going to come up over your head and let me just say long and short you missed it so happens william mary and branham was the prophet of this hour so you're going to hear that we're not making him god we're not elevating him where he's not supposed to be but he pointed us to jesus but y'all point to a man brother ron well let me just ask you who are you pointing to darwin the voice of politics yale university is held as one of the highest universities in our nation in law one of their top-level people said look what we are producing look at the failure of what we are producing listen church world look what you're producing wishy-washy pulpits where every every year the word of god changes to fit the mold or the customs of the day so it produces something look what politics is producing it's not going to get better but this message produces ronnie longs produces andrew glovers produces timothy pruitt's produces andrew and matthew spencer's it produces the word in flesh look around this is what this message produces for those on the internet we don't have a gossip after church who's dating who [Music] who's having to take pornographic classes to get over who's who's an alcoholic anonymous no here come on let me just look at which which camera i want to look right into that camera and i want to tell you here we are not a rehab station where you live with your sins and you just kind of cope to get by here we're at transformation center where you're baptized with the holy ghost where it's an emotion where it's strength where it's a touch of jesus christ himself living on the inside conquering every devil that's in hell that's what's produced here hallelujah [Applause] [Music] you're looking for a church where you can live with your sins wrong spot where you can live a halfway life wrong spot but in a few days you can call me gone i read this to you a few months ago but i'm going to read it to you again 3.00 he is the first and the last he is the beginning in the end he is the cree keeper of creation and he's the creator of it all he is the architect of the universe he is a manager of all times he always was he always is and i want to put the devil on notice he always will be he is unmoved he's unchanged he's undefeated and he's never undone he was bruised and he brought forth healing he was pierced and he used her pain he was persecuted and brought freedom he was dead and he was raised back to life again he has risen and he brings power he reigns and he brings peace the world can't understand him armies can't defeat him schools can't explain him this is well written leaders can't ignore him herod couldn't kill him pharisees couldn't confuse him the people couldn't hold him nero couldn't crush him hitler couldn't silence him the new age can't replace him and the world can't explain him away he is light he is love he is the lord he is goodness and his kindness and his gentleness and he is god he is holy he is righteous he's mighty he's powerful and he's pure he's always right the world the word is eternal his will is unchanging his mind is on me he is my savior he is my god he is my peace you in trouble he's in peace your world's upside down he's your compass i'm talking to you now he's your compass you don't have to live in a haunted house and i'm not talking about mirrors and walls and doors creaking hill i'm talking about this right here you don't have to go to sleep at night and have nightmares all night long because of the life that you're living you know you don't need to be living you don't have to live in that haunted house god can forgive you of your sins wash him away change your life raise you up to walk as a pillar [Applause] [Music] he is my joy he is my comfort he is my lord he rules my life i have to be very honest with you i don't get up and argue with god god's chose my path he's put me on the path he's given me strength to walk so i don't ask him why i don't ask him when i just keep walking somebody's going to overcome it might as well be me it may as well be you [Applause] he is the wisdom of the wise he is the power of the powerful he is the ancient of days he is the ruler of rulers the leader of leaders the overseer of overcome us if that seems impressive to you try this on for size his goal is a relationship with me he helps you teach your class he helps you on the interstate when you're giving people tickets and you don't know what car that you're walking up to just don't give me one you pull me over and give me a ticket they're gonna be trouble at this house that's bribery rather ron you're right you're absolutely right he will never leave me i want you to just think about this of how many people have walked away from you in your life can i preach to you how many of your so-called friends said i'm done and walked out of your life you graduated from high school you said nothing ever come before us and some of them people you never saw again they never called you they never text you oh maybe one or two maybe people you sit with in church we're going to be here for eternity gone they took a different road that road took them places choices take you places in your life by god's grace he's kept you how many drives at night how many drives at night yeah how many drives at night how many drives at night go ahead and raise your hand up how many drives that night did you hear me it drives at night well here's a one of the must that you must do turn on your lights i didn't do a study on this real quick but listen your lights will only shine so far regardless if they're the new kind of lights or the old kind of lights or them round lights they only they only show you so far so it is not good for you to look out into the darkness are you with me it's not good for you to look out and cross bridges before you get to them only drive where the light's at generally there's a line painted on this side of the road and there's a there's dots on this side and there's rumble strips it's good to stay in the middle don't be a hero and get over in the bushes climb over in the medium some of those are strange places to park i've seen too many people sitting in church run off in the medium taking your own path in life there's a song says that elvis sung and he said i did it my way i'm not going to quote the lyrics to you today but he says i did it my way well it wasn't a good way as a matter of fact in the satanic worship it is the number one song that is sung i did it my way brother on i'm going to do it my way where is that influence coming from sometimes we want christianity the way that we want it uh you know we want the holy ghost but we don't want to die out to get it and maybe we want the holy ghost without a sensation because we got a quote we we want the holy ghost without sensation i don't want it to make me act funny i don't want to i don't want my mascara to run i i i don't want to get all excited and my tongue begin to lose control and i start speaking in a heavenly language because because it comes with it it's not the evidence but it comes with it some will see vision some will dream dreams some will speak in tongues whatever i've got to do i got to break through this humanity to get what i need because i can't overcome this on my own but brother ron it feels like in my life i've been in a fog open the door and look down at the line and make you sure you're still in the middle of the road find yourself in the word it ain't god's left you you've just left fellowship [Applause] where is the easiest place to backslide it's not in a bar not listening to country music and rock and roll music and dressing the wrong kind of way sitting in the pew and not receiving fold in your arms and say i i made it i hope the rest of y'all catch up some of you jumping up and down you know if you you know if you just you know sit still because i can't see you jump up and then i can't see well if let me just tell you a couple of things it's kind of like an old woman went to a baptist church and every time the preacher said something she said glory to god excites me the deacon knocked pecked on the shoulder and said we don't do that here she said when i got jesus it causes an excitement on the inside of me we don't do that here he said something else that made her excited she jumped up to her feet and a deacon pecked her on the shoulder again and said we don't do that here she said well i got jesus said we don't do that here so sometimes what you need is more jesus [Applause] my mother was a wonderful little woman she had a little spin that she did when she shouted and this shirt set her down i heard about it i needed more jesus when i heard that i'll tell you why churches get cold they have an nice machine for a preacher and i don't know if you have got a good education or not but ice machines produces ice cubes and then the church gets 40 below zero and everybody's dead still like a morgue but we don't do that here i've got a little problem with emotion i had three children born it was thrilling to hear those children scream right after they were born let me explain something to you for those that don't have children i'm always amazed at young couples my child will never be like that matcha it's those people that could write a book about how to raise children my child will never be like it tomorrow morning i get a dog i get a new dog yeah my dog died it was an australian shepherd it lived to be about seven and a half years old it got cancer and it died it the doctor actually told me to put it down a month before and i said uh-uh not my dog i didn't realize i didn't have but a few weeks left for it before it would go home heaven will be full of some of my dogs best day man i got all wheels on service tomorrow morning i'm gonna pick up a dog it's called bernadoodle now my wife wouldn't let me have a bernese mountain dog because it sheds it sheds really bad for those that don't know they're about that big and they shed they shed everywhere so what you do is you take a burmese mountain dog and you mix it with a poo you know what you know what and it keeps it from it's now hyper allergenic did i say that correct and so you hope there's traits from this dog to this dog owner that is selling me the dog says that my little dog is a princess said she's an absolute princess of all of the the little brood she's the princess of them all well she's coming to a house where she's gonna be spoiled and peppered and loved on and cared for it's going to be her house to live in is that right bro vernon that's right [Applause] that's right but i'm still king and so when she chews on my furniture i'm gonna get her when she chews on the rungs of my chairs i'm going to get her when she eats my bacon and egg sandwich in the morning i'mma get her what are you doing brother ron i'm talking about you god knew before he brought you to this church you chewed on sofas you chewed on rungs of chairs but he still picked you up and he rubbed you and he cuddled over you i said this is my child and i'm going to train you to be citizens of the kingdom of god you're not going to drink no more and you're not going to smoke no more you're not going to run out on your wife no more but i'm gonna give you a kingdom and he did now you see in my earlier life i i was a chimney sweep and i learned something real quick that when i went into somebody's house that dog had as much rights as the children had and so i'd rub that dog sometimes he'd rub me back i was bit on a couple of occasions i didn't like it but i didn't i couldn't beat the dog but i could shut the door and he couldn't get to me but i began to realize that people built great big houses million dollar houses for that dog to live in and that dog just wondered where he wanted to he's wondered what i would do is i'd throw out great big tarps in front of the chimney in case i made a mess which i did ninety percent of the time and it would catch all the nonsense but a lot of them dogs would lay right on that tarp and just look at me through the years i'd build up relationships with some of those dogs because some of them were better than their owner i got a point to there right here i got a real point if i can train a dog you can train your children you can train your children now i'm not speaking as a kid that don't have no children because now i got grandchildren but if i can train a dog that don't know me yet are y'all out there am i preaching on a radio broadcast here is this microphone working if we can train a dog what about our children what you don't know is i took you on a journey i started you out with i did it my way and we're in a battle but your battle is not with putin your battle is not with putin today probably for most of us sitting in this building it'll never be with putin are you with me we're not to even fear communism that that's not what we're supposed to fear but it's that blended religion of catholicism where everybody's born again and everybody's got their own idea that's what you're supposed to feel our greatest enemy is not biden every time i pump gas i blame him but let me just say your greatest enemy is not him you guys are school teachers you probably have more trouble with parents than you do children you know my child will never do that my child no way that they did that yes they did i watched them i i watched them i videoed them i know they did that i know they did it my child would never do it turn your child loose and see if it reflects jesus that's what god has did in this hour now i've took you on a full circle god has turned his children loose to be the greatest army the greatest army in the most difficult hour he puts you in the time of trouble he trained you for battle he got you ready he groomed you he cleaned you [Applause] he gave you the greatest weapons he could give you with that was his battle his word and his word will defeat the devil anywhere any place at any time under any conditions i want to say this to you in closing you do not have to live a defeated life you do not have to beat yourself all the time every day is a new day can i come to this just a moment can i give you something personal now there are some mornings when i wake up and i take a chemo probably seven five out of seven days no reaction almost like taking a sugar pill no reaction and i go about my business but a couple of those days i'm sick i'm throwing up my head screaming but it ain't gonna last forever so i just hold on until it's over and i say in a few hours i'm gonna be better can i can i speak to you now in your temporary situations that you get into yours may not be cancer but in your temporary situations that you get into most of it ain't going to last forever you just keep looking where the light is shining don't look out into the darkness you just keep looking where the light is shining and just keep walking that's what enoch did the world was falling apart but he just kept walking and one day he just walked right off of the earth so that's what we're going to do brother ron will tomorrow be better it's your attitude attitude is a hundred percent of your situation attitude is what you get when you get in service this could be the best service i've ever been in so you keep pulling jesus is going to walk by my isle and i'm waiting on him i'm waiting just to worship him just a little bit why don't you just let god override every excuse that you got every excuse sometimes and this is honestly this is honest sometimes i just write my excuses down of the difficulty of the day i actually write it down and then i walk by a big old gray garbage pail that i got in my house and i just throw all my excuses in there i literally do that i just write it down when i can't handle it no more i just write it down and then when i get done writing it down just walk over and throw it right in trash can because it don't matter once you start making a list i'll just start making a list start making a list sister linda i want to pray for you this morning amen let's all stand musicians come amen he's in the house death
