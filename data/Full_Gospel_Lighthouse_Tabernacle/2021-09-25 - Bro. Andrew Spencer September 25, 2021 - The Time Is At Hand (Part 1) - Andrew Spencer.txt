would like to look over in the book of revelations book of revelations chapter chapter 1. amen i certainly miss not being able to have brother danny steaming here with us this weekend and and uh and we'll be rescheduling him and so we'll work that timing out and let you know we we try to keep these meetings that we have lined up during these during these things kind of tight-lipped as it were and and so because we never know what's going to have to happen because of the covet situation and so he kind of got a little bit exposed there to it and just didn't want to bring anything to you and we say god bless you brother danny thank you very much we certainly appreciate that amen so while i was speaking last weekend and brother jose before i knew brother danny had had canceled and and all of these things i while i was actually preaching the lord dropped this this this thought in my heart and i i'll just tell you i've been building this thought for about three years now and uh finally the lord gave me permission while i was actually speaking during the meeting the lord was dealing with me and i should have known right there that i i was going to be speaking to you this weekend so so you just help us preach this evening amen by the help of the lord i'd like to speak to you on the time is at hand in revelations chapter 1 and verse 1 the bible says the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant john who bear record of the word of god and of the testimony of jesus christ and of all of these things and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand brother branham would mother brandon would come and he would speak and he would say these things blessed is he that readeth or blessed is he that understandeth and what a blessed people that we are to understand that this book is not for another people but this book is for you amen god bless you you may be seated in the presence of the lord i know that i about scared you to death there i've been building this sermon for three years i won't preach three years of notes to you this evening but god lays no god lays thoughts on us on our hearts as ministers and he has a certain time that he wants to bring forth a word at a certain season and maybe as humanity we don't understand everything why not deliver it but god god has his timing in all things and god we realize about the attributes of god that that that god is eternal and we realize that that there is no other being outside of god and the predestinated of god that that are are able to comprehend the the mindset of eternal we as human beings we can't necessarily understand what what eternal life is like but yet we have been dropped into a space of time that we might live under the auspices of the great pouring out of the holy ghost and realizing that god had all of these attributes that were laying on the inside of him before the foundation of the world and god wanted to come and he wanted to express himself he wanted to express himself and there we know that throughout all of the cycles of billions and trillions of years that god was already there and god was god had no beginning and he had no ending but god god didn't have a start date and god don't have a finish date and because god is god he is not changing he's not going he's not coming he's here and he is he he stays in that realm of eternal and you and i necessarily we operate in a world in a world of time everything is moved in our world of time but just to just to kind of set a stage just for a moment for you that god god is not controlled by time because god is eternal and there we can go back and look in the very beginning where we we see where the genesis is there when where we look at the beginning and there when we watch as the logos of god when it begin to go forth and it began to speak and there were things that were laying there and you remember when brother branham would say did you ever draw out a picture in your mind and he said that's what god did there in the very beginning he drawed these things out in his mind that these things were going to be set up and before before it could be a word spoken of let there be light or let there be trees or let there be a sun or let there be rivers or waters it had to be a thought first and brother branham said that god drew a great picture he drew this great picture and he seen that it seemed good to him therefore he spoke it and noticed that word went forth and it expressed out of the one it came out of the one that had the thought and knowing this that god is eternal he cannot change his mind he looks at a thought and he looks at it he looks at his scene and he sees it he speaks it and it's got to come to pass and god will never have to back up on what he has said now as human beings we have to back up on mistakes or or promises that we can't keep because we're human beings but god does never have to back up on what he has said there's many a times that your family members let you down or humanity has let you down but there is one person in this life that you are very acquainted with that has never let you down and that is our lord jesus christ he is he has always been the constant in your life he's always been there and we live in a world where things are constantly changing when when when men are changing their thoughts when when democrats and republicans are changing their ideas and and but we're living in a place where we realize that god is infallible in all of his ways and we're working and and here we are working with the infallibility of the very spoken word of god and we realize that through the message that that brother branham would say that that god had these attributes in him you see they were already there and there god would begin to express himself and he said he said the reason he said he loved fatherhood because he was a father he didn't he didn't he didn't because he didn't just he didn't just think it but he was one he was already a father but be so he could express himself as a father he had to come forth and express himself and express himself through and become a son of man and they're here just to give a a a identification or or or a a and a knowledge to what god is god is eternal and so we realize that the duration of god is everlasting it is to it is eternal it is it is something that you and i in our human beings we realize that god has given us an allotted time to live there god would make a promise that we would live 70 years old to each and every one of us some of us are granted to live above that some some we we go by the way of the grave prematurely or different ways or satan would come and rob us and rob us from our time but god is on your track to get you to where he wants you in time and god is the only one that is eternal and so only way that you can be eternal is if he is indwelling on the inside of you you see there's something that is laying there that can identify itself with this word eternal and that is the gene seed of god that he deposited before the foundation of the world it is eternal as god is eternal so let me say this that if that seed that was deposited on the inside of you before the foundation of the world and he knew when you would come to a place of awakening and arise and you would see yourself it was a time that you were coming you see you could not come in the day of luther because it was not your time you could not come in the day of wesley because it was not your time but the reason why that you're here is because god is operating in a world where all things are known he is omnipresent he is omniscient and he is omnipotent and everything is happening by him and the reason why you live is because he lives now let me say this now satan is saying that you will be destroyed and you'll never overcome but the gene seed of god says differently the enemy can whisper all kinds of lies in your ear as young people and tell you that you'll live with this habitat or you'll live with this this habit or you'll live with this thing in your life but the word of god says differently about your situation but in the realm of eternal time it does not exist and you remember when brother branham would preach the message on perfection i i i love how he did this he said now he said now this great chain of perfection was broke by time space perfection was broken by time space time came because of sin he said let's draw a picture of time he said let's see a perfect circle forever and forever then oliver wants sin dropped in and put a little as my wife calls it a little hickey or a little drop in the chain so it comes down now and eternity continues on but it's not in its perfect condition and there's a little gap that comes down or breaks over this way or goes out this way he said god had to do that because satan caused it the reason why you deal with a time being is because satan caused it but there is nothing that surprised god and it dropped down notice it dropped down to a space of time for for the trying and the perfecting and for the purging of the lost that god by his sovereign grace might someday lift that little hickey or gap back into the perfect circle then she rolls on just the same you see now time now time is the little loop that loops down jesus was from eternity to eternity but he stepped into the time spaces made flesh and came through here in order to sanctify or put a streak of blood all across this place to redeem it and connect it back with god again for all eternity you see that's that's all that time is now now just to give you a glimpse of what or put something to put in your imagination to to identify with this quote is brother random would talk about a perfect circle you would you would look maybe you that are married you look at your wedding band and you would look at it that it's a perfect circle that you are identifying that you are going to live with this woman till death do us part and you're going to live in that spot and you're going to watch you're you're tied with them throughout all eternity but notice what brother branham would do he would take and he would say that now time came and it caused a gap in it and so we would take a perfect circle and we would take just a portion of that gap out of that perfection and brother branham said that it dropped down and he said that's what he came to do in that little spot of time was to put a blood over that time you see there in that time we know that before the foundation of the world began that the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world the reason why you're here tonight is because you are attributes of him the reason why you understand these things is because you are an attribute of him and so we realized that before you ever got here god knew what was going to take place god knew what would happen and he would know what would happen to you in time he knew what satan would cause you to do he knew what satan would try to trick you into he knew what satan would whisper in your ear but before satan can make you believe a lie and go out there and be damned by it the bible said that he was a lamb slain before the foundation of the world so the blood in god's mind was already over top of the surprise that satan thought that he was going to work over on the children of god before satan could ever begin the blood was over top of time now notice now god does not operate god does not operate by time because god is eternal but you and i operate by time god is not in chaos but without you and i having the ability to look at a clock or to look at a calendar and to look at a schedule we would have utter chaos because you and i operate by time the reason the reason why we have a set schedule you you come to church at seven o'clock [Music] seven o'clock is because there is a schedule to get you out of the chaos of laodicea and to get you into the schedule of god's ordained plan for you to be in the house of god and it's more than a custom but we're working by a schedule to bring all of the chaos your whole week has been in chaos but what happens about six o'clock or maybe early in the morning you're realizing that time is coming to a spot that you are called to go to a place that you were destined to go because of time because of time it's the way that it is there is a set up time for you to get your deliverance there's a set up time for you to be free there's a set of time for you to hear the word of god we operate by schedules we operate by calendars we operate and we plan things around time because in the realm of humanity timing is necessary timing is necessary if you're trying to plan out your day timing is necessary if if if we would want to wish somebody a happy birthday we would do it in perfect time and just like today is brother stephen short's birthday we want to wish you a very happy birthday today god bless you brother stephen brother heaven mays had one this week we say god bless you happy birthday but if we would want to wish somebody a very happy birthday and we realize that today is their birthday but if we waited two months to and we know that we're two months late and we would go say hey you know what i want to wish you a very happy birthday you know god has laid it on my heart that just today's gonna be a very special day and that person look at you say hey man you missed my birthday about two months ago it's nice that you cared but you miss the time you see they miss the mark it's like me getting up in here and singing jingle bells in the middle of august or july or something like that i am missing the timing i ain't gonna be singing jingle bells anytime soon from the pulpit but to bring to your attention the timing would be off if i started singing christmas songs right here in the midst of this you'd say hey what world is he living in my timing is off it's just like maybe let me put it in let me put it into into a perspective for you if i would hear that you needed five dollars and you didn't get your paycheck till friday but you needed five dollars so that you could put gas in your tank so that you could go to work and get your paycheck so that you could deposit or maybe you needed five dollars go buy you a nasty cheeseburger down down to mcdonald's where they mess up your order and everything else but you needed that five dollars go get that nasty cheeseburger i'm not i'm not against mcdonald's but they against me and so hallelujah but if i gave you that if you told me you needed five dollars to go get that cheeseburger go get that paycheck now if i would go and maybe let's just step out in time just for a moment but let's go out five or ten years and all of a sudden 10 years later you're a multi-billionaire you're a multi-billionaire you've built an empire of businesses somebody's saying hallelujah talk about me lord jesus but you become a multi-billionaire and you you become an empire you create an empire of businesses and you got unlimited wealth and you got a fleet of cadillacs you're starting to sound like elvis and you got everything in order but i would come to you ten years later and i would say now look brother i done heard i didn't heard that you was in need to get five dollars so that you could go put some gas in your tank so that you could go down and get your paycheck or go get you a cheeseburger that'll mean something to you and i got your five dollars what would happen you look at me and say brother you don't miss the mark i got my five dollars a long time ago and i got a whole lot more of that now see this is like this is like somebody trying to tell you that the days of miracles are done gone by they are missing their muck that's like people trying to tell you that god don't give the holy ghost some more they don't miss the mark you have done receive a deposit from the holy ghost that only he can give you you're not missing the mark you're exactly in the timing of god and everything that you are seeing is manifesting because there is a spoken word that happened in eternity but it's taking place in humanity it's divinity that's taking over to put you back into heavenly places oh come on somebody but notice that god doesn't even operate he doesn't even he that god operates in the realm of eternity but he knows exactly what you need in the spot of time you see and god doesn't show satan all of his timing he doesn't show him his plans he doesn't show him how he's going to do things i just give you an alert that's greater than any fox news or whether channel app notification is coming by your way god does not show satan all of his timing you can receive that as a blessing or a curse but god does not show satan everything in his time and just like when lazarus had been dead for four days in the realm of humanity it looked like jesus had done miss the mark but in eternity he was right on time because he knew he knew that there would be people that maybe had been gone past their day of grace maybe they've done bid dead for days maybe they didn't give up on god four five six years ago but god is a god of first chances that god has second chances a god a third and fourth he's a god that is rich in mercy and god you and i operate in a world of time and we would think that we've done missed it but god is a god yes he's a good god yes he's a god of judgment but god is obligated to his word and he's got to come by every single one of your way it might look like you don't turn them down but god is obligated to come by your way he's obligated and he's showing himself when he stepped in and he took on the realm of humanity he took on the realm of of humanity and he would stand there and he would say roll away the stone and he would speak he would speak in a realm that every devil would know that this is him he would speak into a world that even though lazarus was in a whole other dimension and fellowshipping with the saints that had done going on he spoke he took him from a spot he took him from a spot that that that there he was fellowshipping and he brings him back into a lot of space of time to show that he had the power over death hell and the grave you know that that up in heaven god was eternal and he could not show up there in the corridors of heaven that he had the power over death hell and a grave but he came and robed himself in the ropes of humanity and he stepped into a time body and eternity began to manifest that this was him this was the same one that spoke back there in the very beginning and said let there be it was the same one that spoke to lazarus and said lazarus come forth he was the same voice nature had to recognize that the atoms and the elements had to give way this was the son of man that was speaking and this is what is happening in this day when you watch more than squirrels come into existence when you watch more than storms be spoken into existence when you watch more than tumors we spoke off you watch as sun start calling prodigals it's a time and the time is at hand for the prodigal to return [Applause] it's time that all the prodigal start looking at the enemy say hey i changed my mind i gave up i gave up all of that life for this it's time to get your head out of the hog pin [Applause] the church can't understand this the church world can't understand this why they missed their day they missed their day of visitation and they're living off of the glare of days gone by but not you you're a different people you've got a different covenant over top of you you've got a different promise over top of you this is the time this is the time of the pouring out of the holy ghost this is the time the visions come back this is the time that prophets come back in visions and in dreams and the pouring out of the holy ghost it's a time of fulfillment when you watch brother branham when he is standing there in the junction of time and he starts grabbing over in job chapter 2 and joe in acts chapter 2 he said it's amazing it's amazing that these writers put it and identified over in the chapter two it was a time for fulfillment that which was laying there had laid there for thousands or hundreds of years was now coming to a time of fulfillment humanity can get upset because they look at the things that they see more than the things that they that they realize that promises are laying there i just want to tell you don't look at the clock look at the promise don't look at your situation look at the promise don't look at your schedule what you've got figured out on how this one's going to come how that one's going to come stop putting god in a box i would have liked to have woke you up a long time ago but now and now it's a time to arise over all that sleepless and awaken for this is your time you say well i got a certain date over top of me when god gave the holy ghost it's for you it's for you if you just stop rejecting it it's already in his timing for you to get the baptism of the holy ghost it's in his timing for you to get a pentecostal blessing it's in his timing for you to get the rapturing faith it's in his timing but if you could wake up to watch that this is christ hallelujah it's him and there's none more great than him he is the author and he is the finisher of our faith and we're watching him work through humanity i'm not trying to preach to you some pious guy i'm not trying to tell you something of days gone by or something that's coming you're here you're here you remember when when there was in daniel chapter two that there was a king that had a dream and he had asked he had asked all of the the the physicians or the magicians in that day and all the magis and the wise men why don't you come why don't you come and and tell me what i dreamed and you remember their conversation back with the king and they said now can you tell us your dream and you will tell you what it means he said no you tell me what it means or you tell me what i dreamed and then you tell me what it means or i'm gonna kill all of you you had put them in a spot of desperation and these men realized that they didn't have the goods to dissolve all of his doubts but there just like in daniel chapter 5 when it was with belshazzar notice the same one was operating with nebuchadnezzar and a different kingdom over in belshazzar when there was a handwriting on the wall there was a little lady that said hey don't you be upset about all these things there is a dissolver of doubts that is in the land and i want to tell you that there's a lady that is standing up in this hour all of your questions can be settled there is a dissolver of doubts that is in the land again he won't just tell your dream he'll tell you what your life means you got a purpose man you got a purpose young lady the dissolver of the doubts is the holy ghost but what did daniel say when he went up there notice what he did he went up there in daniel chapter two you can go back and read it and see if i'm right on this or not but notice what he did he went up there with his friends and they entered in and desired to seek the lord over this dream the prophet wasn't alone there was a purpose ahead there was deliverance at hand notice notice if daniel doesn't go in there in a place of time and bring down eternity the king is going to kill all of them but because there was a people that had gathered themselves around the prophet they had been up there praying and the bible said that god the lord came to him in a night vision and he spoke to him these things and daniel said blessed is the lord most high and he began to say that you o lord changes the time changes the times and the seasons you make men and kingdoms to rise and you make kingdoms to fall so there is nothing that can be removed and there's nothing that can be set up it's daniel 2 and 21 if you want to go and read it don't read it right now i'm trying to preach to you but here you watch it that he here he is that notice he removes the kingdom so that he can set up a kingdom so there is nothing that is removed without there something to be coming getting already set up god's got a plan and you need to say this i'm in it you may not understand this timing you may not understand why you're going through what you're going through but you need to identify yourself that you're in his plan there is nothing that is removed and there is nothing that is set up unless it comes from almighty god knowing about it now notice let me let me bring this to you in a level of modern day where we're watching events become clear by prophecy there could not be a removal of a trump don't get political on me right now i'm i'm too fired up to get political with you i could care less what you think about politics politics is of the devil i'm quoting a prophet and we realize that those kingdoms will come to an end but notice there could not be a removal of a trump unless there was something in god's mind to set up abiding notice what happened on that inauguration day you watched as prophecy rolled right into time you thought it was happening maybe years ago and you watched it as it stood there in that royal purple see america's been sold out to purple a long time ago and now you're watching that dragon and that beast rise in power we got more catholicism in america than we've ever had because america sold out a birthright but that didn't surprise god with all the communism and all the colonism and all of these isms down through there this bride is not built upon isms there is no schism amongst the pride there is only a unity of the power of the holy ghost that was set up before time ever began [Applause] [Music] [Applause] there could not be a removal of your first birth unless there was something in the plan of god to set up a new birth there could not come a fall of a kingdom unless there had been one arising the reason why you pushed satan off of his throne was because there was a deep calling to the deep [Applause] i go to church all my life i've heard these things all my life brother andrew i've been in church i grew up in church i've heard the sunday school lessons i've heard all of these things i know between right and wrong then do it you can change your hair and that won't fix you you can change your dress and that won't they won't fix you you can take off your makeup now let me drop this right here that that that you're sitting there you can take off your makeup and you can and you can call yourself a christian but if you got to make up heading back here in the corner just for a rainy day but watch them rainy days you put that makeup on everybody gonna know you got it you go to crime one good time you'll watch that thing wash off of you i'm not here to preach to you about a makeup but i'm talking about a makeup of the soul but notice you can change your makeup you can take off your makeup you can take off your you can take your weave out of your hair you can change your color your hair you can change your residence but it does not change the person that's living there you can take a bad driver and put him in a brand new car he's still a bad driver because you never took his habits away he's still a bad driver just like a man one time he was driving down the road he was driving down the road and he was a taxi driver and he picked up his lady on the side of the street and she got in there told him where she wanted to go to and all of a sudden while they was going down the middle of the road she reached up here and tapped the taxi driver on his shoulder and wanted to tell him something all of a sudden that taxi driver run off the side road ran into a curb he erected into a building ran into all kinds of different things he went over this way and went over that way and finally when he come to a halt they're both sitting there taxi driver and a lady in the back hey just they're just breathing hard as a kid thinking man alive we just made it through happy happy are we happy here we and she said sir i want to apologize to you if i'd have known that tapping you on the shoulder would have caused a wreck like this i'd have never done it he said ma'am it's not your fault my last job was a hurt driver you see you can change cars but if you don't change your mentality and you don't change your heart you're never going nowhere you'll still drive the same way you'll still operate the same way you'll still have the same kind of a thinking you'll think there's a dead man that's hanging on to you but when you are a new man the old man has been put off and you put on the new man you don't think like an old man you don't drive like the old man you don't talk like the old man the old man is gone and the new man has put on faith has put on virtue has put on all of these fruits of the spirit and you mortify the deeds of your flesh why because you killed the old man if the old man starts tapping you on the shoulder it shows that you got more to kill out but thank god he's given you a time to make it right [Applause] we're glory hallelujah since i laid that old man down i buried him in the name of jesus and he ain't getting up out of that ground [Applause] now notice what what what the prophet isaiah would say in isaiah chapter 55 my thoughts are not your thoughts and my ways are not your ways the only way that you can think his way is to have the very mind of christ but notice what he would say when you go down and find it down in verse 10 and verse 11 so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth he will prosper in the thing that i sent it to do and it will bring to pass it will bring to pass all that i have written of it to do notice in the element of time you were predestinated before the foundation but in the element of time you are expressing the bible word just like 2 000 years ago it looked like there was never going to be a removal of the fall off of mankind off of humanity but at the fulfillment of time all the prophecies hooked in one man for the setting up of a new kingdom for the setting up of a new kingdom they come arise they come a fall and they come around and there has to be of one kicking off the old serpent of the heart and it has to come a dove come and land on the throne room but he won't land there if you still got a wolf nature if you're always barking at everything you always barking about this and barking about that one how was she just better than that don't you know she's been fixing her hair like that for the last 20 years get a new style if you're always barking at something it shows that there's still a nature on the inside of you and that holy spirit can fly all around he can get on your loved ones he can get on your neighbors and you'll think why in the world any landing on me why because you still got a wolf nature he's afraid that you bited him like that's what the bible said over in ezekiel 36 i believe it's 36-27 that that god has come to give you a new spirit and then he places a new spirit and then his holy spirit comes on top of you brother branham said that he'd give you a new spirit so that you could get along with the holy ghost when he come can you imagine the audacity of man barking at the holy ghost i don't know about that brother hey just go down to the local church you'll see them barking at one another because they can't live right they've got the rules set up that this is the way things are going to go or you're getting a boot the reason why the local church has to boot so many preachers out of the pulpit is because they ain't got nothing they can live by lord you got me into this [Applause] well so far all this is about fresh as it gets i guess that's what three years of building will do for you notice what he did he come into a space of time to redeem those that were his because of the fall because of the fall you became in a fallen state and adam looked right adam did the job but because of direct disobedience to the very word of god he was not entitled to the token life because he deliberately walked out he disobeyed god and he walked out but notice what he does christ does in this day he comes to redeem all those that are his you see before you fell before you got trapped into it before you came in your first birth you are already his how do you say those words i am his i am his but notice what he did because you were his and the devil put you in his pawn shop and said that you were his there came a good man that walked in there and took you off the shelf because you were already his you don't have to pay for it you don't have to go in there and sign for anything else walk out just walk out of that pawn shop don't let the devil lie to you no more don't let him whisper in your ear no more walk out of the pawn shop you ain't got to pay for your sin you ain't got to build up something you ain't got to work up something you're already free there's been a price put on you you have been bought with the blood of the lamb not born of a corruptible seed but of an incorruptible seed just like when boaz looked out there and he seen a fair woman out there boaz looked out there and said that is my wife she may not have looked at it she may not look like it in that state but i want you to know when he went down there and redeemed naomi's estate he got ruth in it and when he went down there ruth was no longer known as ruth the moabitess she was known as boaz's wife boaz means in him is strength in him is virtue in him is power he she is no longer known as ruth as ruth that walked with naomi as ruth as roof as the wife of melion but she was known as the wife of boaz her first marriage had been stricken off and there was an invisible union that had took him place when he said you wait here while i go down there and do the kinsmen redeeming work and he went down there and made a public display and he kicked off his shoe and saying i am paying for her she is rightfully mine is there anybody is there anybody that's a closer kin that can raise up but there was somebody that didn't want to mar their testimony and brother branham said there was one that was closer there was one that was closer by your first birth but by your second birth you identified what fishbowl has you go to studying out boaz boaz means strength boaz means in him is virtue in him is power and you go and look over in solomon's temple that it is one of the columns or the pillars of the brazen or the brazen pillars that is set up in solomon's temple that is over on the left-hand side of the temple it's 18 cubits high and it is placed there as a strength what does the book of revelation say about him that overcometh i will place as a pillar as a pillar and you are not somebody that can be pushed off there is a strength the church age was in no strength at its time but there was an overcomer that had tapped into a resource of strength and in the time element boaz stepped in i said this is mine i am worthy enough to pay for it i'm worthy enough to call it mine and what did he say in this age i'll no longer call you church but i'll call your bride so you might understand it but now you notice now you notice this here in the unveiling of time he come to show himself and to show himself christ in full view to the church but notice notice what what the prophet does in revelation of jesus he said the greek word for revelation is apocalypse which means unveiling this unveiling is perfectly described in the example of a sculptor unveiling his work of statuary exposing it to the onlooker so so here you can imagine you can imagine that maybe we would have a statue of what's whatever maybe a statue of a person or maybe a statue of a confederate soldier or different things but you could guess that it all you want to because a sheet is over top of it and you can't see well i can see that it kind of looks it kind of looks like a man behind it but you don't really know you're just guessing at it but notice when the sheet is pulled off of it and he exposes himself to the onlooker you can look at the work that is done by the master you can say that is him you can see that that that's exactly what i thought it was and that is what he has been doing in this hour as revealing himself as jesus christ is saying yesterday today and forever that that maybe you thought that that was him you watch anybody that come out of a trinitary background and come over here and realize that jesus is god they'll go back in their mind and think man life that was him all that time you know i kind of thought that that was him but now i see that it's him it's no longer guessing at it but that was him that was him that put the groceries on your porch when you didn't have the money to do it it was him that kept that car from wrecking into you he was him that was there he exposes himself to the onlooker and blessed are your eyes for you see and blessed are your ears for you here notice man had always wanted to get a glimpse of god and when moses was the was the prophet of the law and moses wanted to get a glimpse of him what did he do god hid him over in the clip of the rock he hit him in the cliff of the rock and there he began to watch behind part of a man as he was walking what was he seeing he was watching and he caught a glimpse of him walking away the hind part the back part of a man but notice what has been revealed to you in this hour you go in the book of revelations chapter one and you'll see that you are seeing christ face to face you can look and you can see the seven personages of jesus christ laying right there in the very first book of revelations it's not open to everybody they'll look at it and say man what was john eaton when he started writing that down but you look at that and you see the symbol that this is him that is walking in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks notice what was he doing moses was catching a glimpse of where he was going just where he was going he was catching a glimpse of where he was going where he was hitting but notice in this hour you're not just watching where he's going you're seeing where he's at you're not just looking into the future you look back and you see that's been him through the prophets that's been him i see him working a future work in our future home and setting it up but this is him that is setting up this kingdom that is showing this is him you're not just looking at the back part of the man and seeing where he's going he is taking you with him my goodness this is the time this is the time of the unfolding and the unveiling that this this is him you remember when brother branham excuse me my brother branham is there and he's out there early in the morning and i i'm setting something up for you when brother branham was out there early early one morning and it's he said it was a cloudy foggy day and he said he looked and there was those three rainbows you remember there's some three rainbows out there and he said it was something attracting me what no sun out there that could have caused that but something was attracting me to it and when he began to get so close to it that the angel said now that's close enough and then he started to speak that jehovah of the old testament is jesus christ of the new notice notice he said that was a confirmation of my message of him this is not a message of a man this is not a message of uh of of of of a prophet this is not a message of william branham this is a message of him and what is it it is a message and the time is at hand if god if there was no people that would have been ready to receive it there had been no message come forth but because there was a people that was on the land at a predestinated time and the time was at hand because there was a people ready to receive it he could come forth and show himself and the reason why he did was because it's a deep calling to the deep the time was at hand but notice notice in daniel chapter 12 look look just for a moment i i hope i'm not wearing you out i believe i'm preaching a message preach uh believers you are preachers and your own ranks in your own home but i believe i'm preaching the message believers i'm not preaching something to you over top of your head i'm preaching to you exactly what the message is and if you feel like i'm preaching over top of you is because you've not spent enough time in this message but if you'll spend your time digging into this you'll find that this is him and this is the time of releasal but look in daniel chapter 12 with me verse 1 and at the time shall michael stand up the great prince which stands for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even that's even to that same time and at that time thy people shall be delivered every one that shall be found written in the book and many of them that slip in the dust of the earth shall awake some of the everlasting some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contempt and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament and they that turn many to righteousness as it starts forever and ever but thou o daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased lotus what we are living in and what we are looking at is that the book of daniel shows that god is coming to the jews but if you look it is perfectly identified with revelations chapter 10 that the mighty angel stands up but here in the book of revelation it shows that god is coming to the gentiles but notice what is it he always comes at the time of trouble and you're going to look it out on the land just for a second you ain't got to spend much time and you are living in a time of trouble but it's in the time of trouble that michael stood up which is christ in angelic form and notice in this day there we see the mighty angel standing and putting his foot on the land of sea the land and the sea and his feet were as a pillar of fires notice that is his body that pillar fire has been swooping and sweeping over your life and protecting you for such a time as this esther didn't come to the kingdom for any other time but this time there was a setup of a kingdom so that she could be a queen and this is your time young people this is your moment this is your hour to set up not an earthly kingdom but a spiritual kingdom notice what the disciples were always asking him he said at this time that you'll set up your kingdom he said it's not for you to know the times and the seasons notice when you go down to revelations chapter 10 and verse 6 you'll notice that there he swore he took a sworn affidavit there is none greater than god so he swore by himself just like when you look over in romans chapter 4 that he swore by himself there was nobody greater so he made a sworn after david and he confirmed an oath and he swore by himself that time would be no longer notice notice what he is saying that the time of holding back all of these mysteries is no longer and it's before the people now that which that was bound at the door of creeds and dogmas has now been released to the bride of jesus christ the time is here notice what david would do when david was the one that would write would write most of the book of psalms notice what he did he would reach over there and having prophetic vision and he would reach over there and he would write songs he didn't know what he was doing but he was portraying christ he didn't know what he was doing he didn't know what he was doing in psalms 22. he didn't know what he was doing in psalms 23 but he was portraying christ but when he reaches over and it comes down to psalms 27 and the bible said the lord is my light you watch you go back and you can study all the history books i've done it you can go back you can study larkin you can study all of these men you can study luther you can study wesley when they come to the preaching of the rapture all of them go to first thessalonians in first corinthians 15 they go back there and they start preaching the word rapture and the word rapture is not even found in the bible but it means a catching away but here they are david is here and he's tapping into a channel and he's bringing out an element in time and he's bringing and showing it in eternity that this is a people that is going to say this you are the people there's a lot of people that read psalms 27. there's a lot of people that look over there's a lot of people that identify that this is their favorite scripture but there's nobody like you because you had a prophet that would come here and he would speak in 1965 and he would take this thought to lace it right in there and put it in there right before things that are to be notice he says now just a little background for this message on the rapture but the prophet said this is the background this is the backdrop you know where when you go into to buy a beautiful diamond they set it on a black canvas and they put light over top of it to show forth its beauty the reason why you can sing this psalm is because there's a light over top of you this light didn't just stop following when it was following the children of israel when they were coming out in exodus chapter 14 in exodus chapter 15 this light has been following you all the days of your life and that pillar of fire has been circling and he's calling his children and notice what he's doing he is here to usher in us right into the rapture notice what he's doing he is taking her by the arm and he's leading her through all of these promises this is your time this is your moment this is your hour notice your backdrop look at the chaos that's going on look at the concerning scenes that you look at on the news you can get upset all about the politics you can get upset about knitting netanyahu getting moved off and you can get upset about trump getting moved off or you can get upset about biden losing his brain you can get upset about all of these things i'm being i'm being serious here you can get upset about these things it's an upsetting time but this world is not our home history is being repeated you're watching this chaos right here in the midst of all of this darkness but there's a people that identify the lord is my light the lord is my light and my salvation [Music] whom shall i fear brother andrew have you looked at this chaos of covet have you looked at how many kobe cases we're seeing are you looking are you looking what we're seeing i'm not looking at that i'm looking up the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear the lord is my boaz of my life he is my strength of whom shall i be afraid when the wicked even my enemies of my foes came upon me to eat up my flesh you think kovit's bad there's a plague that's coming that they will rot in their flesh there's something coming a whole lot worse than covet there is a plague of sin that is over top of this generation and the only thing to get out of it is the blood of jesus christ but when my enemies and my foes come upon me to eat upon my flesh they stumbled and fell when they come to snatch you up when they kind of then they tried to come up and eat up your experience they stumbled and fell though in hosts should encamp against me my heart shall not fear the war should rise against me in this will i be confident i ain't confident in fox news i ain't confident in conservative news i ain't confident in cnn i ain't confident in biden i ain't even coveted in trump i ain't confident who you want to be in 2024 the only confidence that you can have is in the king of kings and the lord of lords he's come to set up more than a presidency he's come to set up a kingdom that you would be kings and priests in this will i be confident you can't be confident in yourself when my enemies encamp about me this you can be confident in church this you can be confident in that the angels of the lord and camp about them that fear him so if the enemy is setting up his camp around you he's got more than you just to deal with he's got angelic beings that are there to war him off in this will i be confident that the bible said in exodus 23 and 20 that i will send my angel before thee to keep thee in the way he knew what you would go through in laodicea he knew what you would face he knew what you go through but in this will i be confident this message will pick us up and translate our bodies we will walk like he not walked we will take a step like enoch's steps we will change like sarah changed one thing have i desired of the lord that will i seek after that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the lord and to inquire in his temple for in the time of trouble when did michael stand up in the time of trouble when does the mighty angel stand up in the time of trouble let me say this to you michael is standing up the mighty angel is standing up and the bride of jesus christ is on her feet she is on her feet because a prophet said in christ the mystery of god revealed he said she won't be shut up she'll be taken up [Applause] you're not standing alone for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me i thought there was a tent minister to come brother andrew you're the tent you're the tent where's that third pole working at in the tent where's it operating at oh you can get mad at me all you want to but where is the third pool operating at in the tent of humanity you will meet me in there you'll find me in there you'll find this message in there it is operating in the tin of humanity because it came from divinity [Applause] he will hide me in his tabernacle the tabernacle of his word has enclosed me and enveloped me [Applause] and i i know i'm over time for tonight but i'm sitting i'm setting something up because i can do that i'm setting this up for tomorrow so you just go ahead and buckle up for tomorrow what did brother branham say he said that third pool cannot be impersonated he said that i must be loyal to that third pole what is it what is laying there and that old dead bag of bones but the very life can these live again can these prophesy can they say what john saw over there of taking a book and eating a book in the time of trouble there's a people that have set up themselves to be a kingdom and have preached to god what is she loyal to that's her boy i hear here's where satan gets in trouble this can't be impersonated and it can't be operated outside of this sure there was a lot of there was a lot of people that looked right sure there's a lot of people that looked like they would fulfill it you mean to tell me that's the people of the third pool that bunch of chaos if i was going to choose somebody i'd choose one of jesse's first sons i'd have chose somebody maybe a little bit bigger in stature oh bethlehem thou art least amongst all the tribes you are set up oh good lord and mercy you are set up to be the very house of david i'll chose somebody else to run with that message i'd have chose somebody else that was a little bit better a little bit stronger he didn't chose you he didn't choose you because you were you were good to look upon and you were coming to look upon he chose you because the before the foundation of the world he knew that you would drop down in this element of time and there would be a word deposited and you would grab that and you'd say in this will i be confident oh let me finish it and we'll bring it to a close in the secret of his tabernacle it's a secret that the rest of the world don't know nothing about they look upon you as a as a bunch of backwash look upon you as a people that were not identified with the so-called religions of the world that's exactly what we are we're not identified with them but we are identified with him and if i am identified with him he cannot leave me he cannot forsake me he cannot run off and leave me i am his thoughts i am in him and i cannot be forgotten on rapture mourning you won't be forgotten sister heather he is good as his word you'll be there because i met you in that third pool [Music] oh hallelujah in the secret of his tabernacle shall he have me he shall set me up on a rock you think about this revelation that you're set on no man can impersonate it no man can take it from you you didn't put yourself there you didn't build up his church he set you there now get ready because brother branham said after the seals were released he said everything would be worship everything would be worship verse 6 and now shall my head be lifted up above my enemies round about me therefore will i offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy i will sing yea i will sing praises unto the lord what is that that you're looking at that's him that's him it stepped out a template stepped out of eternity it stepped down into a little hickey of time musicians are coming because i'm a closing but here he steps out of that perfection because the time was at hand and there that little gap that was broken off because of sin brother branham said that one day he'll bring the gap back together and eternity will be perfect the time of rapture is at hand the time of the great anointing is at hand i said brother andrew you're preaching like this is the last service it could be for somebody this could be the last time you hear this so well i thought about them people i thought they were i thought they surely would have left the door open for me we didn't close the gap noah didn't close the gap we didn't close the gap of time he brought it back how did he close it brother greg he brought you right back to where you were in his mind before there was a fall everything's back and it's perfection i'll go ahead and give god praise in the house of god [Applause] oh hallelujah hallelujah just praise the name of the most high god just now lift up your hands so thank you lord thank you lord that you chose me thank you lord that you
