Amen. And as we go to the prayer request, we have many needs. We want to remember each and every one of our elderly that sent in prayer requests for themselves. Want to pray for them. Also, everyone that's dealing with cancer, fighting that, taking chemotherapy. Remember our pastor, Brother Ron, Sister Terresa Delaney, Sister Wanda Hinkle. I want to pray for brother Jeff Breeden this week as he starts chemotherapy. I want to pray for Sister Mary Morris. She had a accident on a bicycle yesterday. She has had 10 staples in a place in her head that was a cut. She had surgery to remove gravel in the elbow. And also just be remembering brother Chris through all of this there. Uh please remember my uncle Bobby Turner or Robbie Robby Turner. He had a stroke in May and because of previous problems with his knee now being inflamed with inflammation, it's making it hard to do therapy. He had a stroke about 10 weeks ago and is fighting depression. He just needs a real touch, a miracle to get out of where he is as well. Amen. Just be remembering that. Sister Don McBride. Amen. I want to pray for Bobby Smith, Brother Josh Jones. ask us to remember him. He has a brain tumor and he has surgery on Tuesday. So remember those needs there. How many that would have an unspoken request? Say, "Lord, just pass by my way this morning." Amen. I'm going to ask brother Andrew if he would just come pray over these needs this morning. God bless you. Amen. Heavenly Father, we come before you, Lord Jesus. Lord, there's no God like our God. Lord Jesus, we just want to express, Father, how much that we love you. Lord, how great that you are, Lord. You created the worlds with the very breath of your lungs. Lord, you spoke the words. You said, "And let there be." And there was, Father. Lord, everything has to obey. Your commandments, oh God. The dust had to obey. The stardust had to obey. And it came into fruition. Father, we're your children, Lord. And we realize that you are the great Jehovah here in our midst, Lord. And you said where two or three are gathered in my name there you would be. Now Father we have gathered here tonight Lord today Lord Jesus binding our faith together in the spirit of unity Lord. We are centralizing Lord Jesus our attention Lord to these needs this morning. And we ask Lord that you would just take our faith oh God and brother Brandham would talk about it being the atomic bomb. It's greater than the atomic bomb. It's greater than this bomb and that bomb. Lord, I pray that you would take our faith of your beloved wife, Lord Jesus, and that you would just begin to move, Lord, upon these needs, Lord, for Bobby Smith, Lord, for this individual that's had in this spot of depression, oh God, for every cancer patient here. Lord, we have had a word in this generation, Lord, that not even cancer would be able to stand before our prayer, Father. Lord, you have challenged us to believe, Lord, like never before. And Lord, we just come to this moment in time and we are expecting you to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we could ever ask or think. And we just want to push back Satan this morning and say, "Satan, your hand has been upon us too much. It has gone too far. And we ask, oh God, that you would just come and renounce everything, Lord Jesus, that Satan has put against your children. Lord, we we we put a reproach against this enemy and say, "Satan, you take your leave from this body. Take your leave from this building. Take this leave from our minds, oh God, and make us to be liberated in your word, Father. May our faith exceed, Lord, our expectations this morning. Lord, may you just come on the mountaintop and prove that you're Jehovah Gyra. May you come on this hilltop and prove that you're Jehovah Shalom. May you come on this mountaintop here this morning and take us into the realm to believe for the impossibles. Lord, as brother Ron would come and minister the word today, we ask that you would use the man of God to speak directly to our needs. Father, no matter what level of sincerity that we are, no matter how deep that we've been in the message or how new we are to it, we ask God that you would speak to us, Lord, only as you would speak to us. Father, you know how to find us where we are. This service is yours today. We put it in your hands. We ask God that everything that'll be done and said here for your glory today that it would not be that it would not be unto men to please men, but it would be unto the most high God. So we invite you here this morning. We want you to feel welcome, Lord. We wash your feet with our tears and we dry it with our praise. Oh God, may you come amongst us in a very specific way. This day is a day that you've made so we will rejoice and be glad in it in Jesus name. Amen. And amen. Amen. Continue to play that for me if you don't mind. This morning we're going to receive this morning's offering and then we'll have Sister Rihanna Weeks come and sing for us and then Sister Sarah and Sister Julia come sing.

[Music] When I went through the fire, you were right there beside me. You were always on time. [Music] Hallelujah. Would you stand with us this morning, Kia? As we get ready to prepare for the preaching of the word, just a such a sweet presence here this morning. We just want to invite the preacher at this time to just come and take this service. You are here moving in our maze. [Music] I worship you. I worship you. You are here working in this place. I worship you. I worship you. You are here moving in our midst. I worship you. [Music] I worship you. You are here working in this place. I worship you. I worship you. Way maker, miracle work, promise keeper, light in the darkness. My God. Oh, that is who you are. [Music] Miracle, promise keep light in the darkness. My God, that is who you are. [Music] You are here. Oh, touching every heart. I worship you. Can you lift your hands and say, God, this is why I worship you. You are here. Oh, healing every heart. I worship you. I worship you. You are here. Oh, turning life around. [Applause] I worship you. I worship you. You are here and you're making every heart. I worship you. I worship you. You are here. You are here. and you're turning lives around. [Music] I worship you, Lord. I worship you. You are here committing every heart. I worship you. Everybody's got their own reason, but this is why I worship him. I call you way maker, miracle worker, promise keeper, light in the darkness. My God, that is who you are. [Music] Way maker, miracle worker, promise keeper, light in the darkness, my God. Oh, that is who you are calling. Away maker, a miracle worker, promise keeper, light in the darkness. My God. Oh, that is who you are. [Music] Even when I don't see it, you're working. Even when I don't feel it, you're working. You never stop. You never stop working. You never stop. You never stop working. Even when I don't see it, you're working. Even when I don't feel it, you're working. You never stop. You never stop working. You never stop. You never stop working. Even when I don't see it, you're working. Even when I don't feel it, you're working. You never stop. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You never stop working. You never stop. You never stop working. You never stop. You never stop working. You never stop. You never stop working. You never stop. You never stop working. Even when I don't see it, you're working. Even when I don't feel it, you're working. You never stop. You never stop working. You never stop. You never stop working. Way maker, miracle work, promise keeper, &gt;&gt; in the darkness, &gt;&gt; my God, &gt;&gt; you are. &gt;&gt; I want you to take a minute and I just want you to begin to thank the Lord for right here in this place for him coming and filling this atmosphere with his presence. I want you to lift your voice. [Music] I want you to think there was a lot of people sometimes that had saw a lot of rainbows, but when they read the scripture why God put the rainbow in the sky, it meant something different to him. [Music] you know why God has done what he's done for you in your life and you've read the scripture about it. It gives you a different meaning than it does to the people that just see the different things going on out there in the world. They see it just as normal circumstances or daily life. But because you are who you are, you see it through the lens of the word. So through that lens, I want you to praise God for what he is to you right now. [Music] I want to ask you as Bible believers, is he a way maker to you? Is he a miracle worker to you through the lens of his word? Is he a promisekeeper to you? Has he been a light in the darkness to you? Is he your God this morning? &gt;&gt; I know he was Sister Mary Morris's God yesterday, but whose God is he today? I say he's my God. I say he's a mighty God. I say he's more than able. I say he's a promisekeeper. I say he's a way maker. I say he's my God. In the midst of my trial, in the midst of my chaos, in the midst of my despair, in the midst of my criticism, in the midst of the shadow of the valley, I realize he is my light. Can you worship that kind of a God through the lens of his word? As brother Ron comes this morning, I want you to lift your voice. I want you to make your declarations very clear this morning that God, I need you this morning to speak to me live to ear that I'll know that it was Jehovah. &gt;&gt; My God, that is who you are. Oh, way maker, miracle worker, promise keeper, hide in the darkness. My God, that is [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad that is who he is? &gt;&gt; And you know him that way. Amen. God bless you this morning. So good to see each and every one of you. And &gt;&gt; have you come to have church? &gt;&gt; Have you come to have church? &gt;&gt; Won't you tell your neighbor this morning, I have come to have church? Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You see, we don't know what tomorrow holds or the next week holds, but God does. And we have a God that's always on time. So, he feeds you in the word, preparing you for the battle that you're getting ready. God is never reactive. He's always proactive. He's always ahead of your battle getting you ready for it. And so, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. We love the Lord. And &gt;&gt; I just share something with you was on my heart this morning. Many years ago, I sat in your seats. And I always came to church thinking, God, I want you to speak to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. There may be hundreds of people here, but I want you to come to my pew. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; And speak to my heart today. Our prophet would speak to us and tell us that you pull on the gift of God &gt;&gt; and God will come to exactly where you're at. &gt;&gt; You know, if you walk out of service and say, "I didn't get nothing." It's nobody's fault but yours. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't want to carnally compare this, but many of us go to Costco for $20 item and walk out with $300 in our &gt;&gt; need may have been this small this morning when you walked in, but won't you walk out of here? Hallelujah. He's that kind of a God. Amen. Didn't you enjoy last night? &gt;&gt; I just I just thought it was just a tots and so we certainly love Brother Nathan, his family, his church, Brother Wayne, and all of them. Please tell them all hello. I thought last night's message was just absolutely great. He shared with something with us last night and it was he had did some research. He went to where Hot Springs, Arkansas in 1963. His grandfather was in a meeting and then he was also in the meeting with brother Brandham. He shared with us a picture last night of of his grandfather, Brother Samuel, introducing Brother Brandham to the pull pit. And brother Brandham is coming to speak. And I would say that's probably one of the greatest honors that he ever had. And he called him the one of the greatest preachers that ever lived since Jesus Christ. I'd say that was accurate as well. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then he introduced brother Brandham. And here's his grandson along with brother Ray's grandson standing and speaking what the prophet spoke. And so we're so honored to have brother Nathan with us. And uh I I feel like a little boy when I stand beside of him. And I Amen. He's just a great speaker. And so we thank the Lord for what God is doing in his lives. And want to continue to remember Sister Mary that God would be with her as she has had this bike wreck. And and so if you ride bikes, you'll eventually have a wreck. And so we just pray that God would just be with her during this time and and uh just pray that God would be with the entire family. I quit riding bikes because I I got hit by a car and uh and so I quit. My wife don't know it today, but they had paved Port Republic Road. It was a new paving project that had just been happening. So, the pavement was on the side was too tall and I slipped off of that pavement when cars were passing me and my my bike flipped me out in the road and an elderly woman got stopped in time until her her her car was right against my back and it flipped the bike out of the road. And so, I hid her license plate and God was just rich in mercy. And so I I told that little lady, she was probably she was probably in her 80s, and I told her, I said, "Well," she said, "I've witnessed a miracle." I said, "You're not only going to witness a miracle, but when I take this bike home, I'm going to hang it up, and I'm never going to ride it again." So, and I have been as good as my promise. And so, if Mr. If Sister Mary is uh watching today, hang that back up, man. Amen. We're also thankful for for brother Jeff's report. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They did the biopsy this week and they had told him that he only had a matter of time if it was cancer on his liver. There's a spot of cancer on his pancreas that they're going to work on. And so, but if it's on your liver, we're that they gave him no hope. And so, they went this week with the biopsy on his liver and it was zero cancer. And so, we thank God for that. We thank God for that. So, he's got a lot more days to be grandpa. And so, we thank the Lord for that. When you get those kind of reports, they're your life and death. And so we thank God for life. Amen. I go tomorrow to the cancer center and to see all my cancer team. So you if you'll please remember us in prayer that God would just continue the process and be with us. And so for those that don't know, we continue the chemotherapy every day. Some days it makes me some sick, some days it don't. Some days it makes me tired, some days it don't. But you know, I got a good nurse. And so we just thank the Lord for that too. I'd like to speak to you today on armed and dangerous. &gt;&gt; Amen. I think I'm preaching to the right audience. And so &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. If you will turn with me to Philippians chapter 4 and verse 13. Then I've got a few scriptures I'm going to quote pretty quickly and so but we'll start with Philippians chapter 4 and verse 13. And I want you to read this scripture with me today. You said you was ready to have church, so let's do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hey, I heard myself in the in the sermon last night. &gt;&gt; And it was pretty interesting. I was in a lone ranger and uh he said, you know, he asked his dad, "Dad, he's in trouble. He's in the third chapter. He's in trouble." He said, "Well, he's going to be in the sixth chapter, so he's going to be all right." So, I heard myself in the sixth chapter last night. And so, &gt;&gt; Amen. We may be in the third, but we'll be in the sixth. So, thank you. Thank you, brother Nathan. Philippians chapter 4 and verse 13. Let's all read this scripture together. I can do all things through Christ which strengthen me. May the Lord bless the reading of his word. You may be seated. 1 Coronicles chapter 16 and verse 11. Seek ye the Lord and his strength. Seek his face continually. This this scripture was quoted last night, was already in my notes. So, here we are. Isaiah 40:41 and verse 10. Fear thou not, for I am with thee. I love that. Fear thou not, for I am with thee. Be not dismayed, for I am thy God. I will strengthen thee. Yay, I will help thee. Yay, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness. These are your promises. &gt;&gt; This is God's love letter to you. I want you to read this like your girlfriend wrote it to you. boyfriend wrote it to you. I'll get I'll get you there. Isaiah 41 and verse 10. Let's read it. Fear thou not, for I am with thee. Be not dismayed, for I am thy God. I will strengthen thee. Yay, I will help thee. Yay, I will open uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness. Amen. I want you to remember God's words never has an end to it. That's right. &gt;&gt; It's not like your milk. It's not like your eggs that have expiration dates. &gt;&gt; Words have power. &gt;&gt; They have incredible potential for them. These words were given to you as a believer. And the most supernatural thing about you is your tongue. Right. That's right. &gt;&gt; And when you take this word into your heart, life and death is in your tongue. And when you quote these words back to God, &gt;&gt; notice what the scripture Isaiah 40:31 says. But they that wait upon the Lord, they shall renew their strength. &gt;&gt; They shall mount up on wings as an eagle. They shall run and not be weary. They shall walk and not faint. Amen. &gt;&gt; Psalms 73 and verse 26. My flesh and my heart faileth, but my God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever. &gt;&gt; God's word's eternal. &gt;&gt; His thoughts is the weapons of our warfare. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're here to wage war. Amen. &gt;&gt; We are Satan's worst nightmare. &gt;&gt; Don't tell me how bad the devil is. You're greater than him. &gt;&gt; Don't make him bigger. &gt;&gt; It wasn't David that went down off of a hill measuring Goliath. Goliath told us how big he was. &gt;&gt; It didn't matter how big the devil is. You're greater. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because greater is he that is in you. I'm not talking about you. Your flesh is greater. But the seed of God that's on the inside of you that God deposited &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; It wasn't your choice. It was God's choice. &gt;&gt; And you as eternal as God is eternal. So no matter how bad your battle is, you're going to make it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, notice this. We're commissioned. We're commissioned and we have authority. Brother Brandon would explain to us authority greater than the angels that are in heaven. &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus, you have power to bind and loose devils. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? We're amening. &gt;&gt; Everybody ought to be amening right here. &gt;&gt; These are your promises. So instead of binding and loosening devils, stop complaining. &gt;&gt; Stop whining. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. This is only the beginning here. &gt;&gt; Stop complaining. &gt;&gt; Stop dealing with the devil credit. Don't get up before your neighbors, say, "Oh, how bad the devil's been to you." &gt;&gt; Start talking about how great God is. &gt;&gt; Well, Brother Ron, what do I do when I explain how mean the devil is and how bad it's been this week? You're only giving him a testimony. That's right. &gt;&gt; You're only giving him a voice. &gt;&gt; That he's had power in your life. &gt;&gt; Let me just say it how it is. You're explaining that the devil that has fought you this week is greater than the power of the angels that are in in heaven. I got news for you. I got new no sympathy for none of that. &gt;&gt; So she we should walk in victory. Amen. &gt;&gt; We should talk in victory. &gt;&gt; We should think in victory. &gt;&gt; There should never be a spot to where we give up. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Many years ago, I saw a t-shirt. I've came to the end of my rope and I've tied a knot and I'm hanging on. Well, I got news for you. If that is how you're doing, you're in trouble. If you're hanging on with your human flesh, &gt;&gt; you're absolutely in trouble. &gt;&gt; But I found out a long time ago, it isn't me that's hanging on. &gt;&gt; Help me preach. It is not me that's hanging on. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It is not how my feelings are this week. It's not where I'm having a great sunshiny week or or great gloomy week. It isn't me hanging on. &gt;&gt; It's God that's hanging on to us. &gt;&gt; I've got a news bulletin for you this morning. God answers your prayer, &gt;&gt; but you have to pray them. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; God answers your prayer, &gt;&gt; but you have to pray them first, &gt;&gt; brother Ron. But I can't get my prayers answered. Are you praying them? &gt;&gt; I want you to get that one. You got to pray the prayer. That's right. &gt;&gt; Spend time in your prayer instead of begging God. Just tell him what you need &gt;&gt; and start thanking him for what he has done. He is doing and is going to do. &gt;&gt; Thank him that he made you in his plans. &gt;&gt; You ought to be able to shout. And we ain't even got started yet. I want you to understand many years ago there was a man that wrote a books on power of positive thinking. You know that wasn't the message but it is the message. &gt;&gt; You need to think positive. &gt;&gt; You need to talk p positive. &gt;&gt; Are you with me tonight? Brother said never let a negative word go through your mind. &gt;&gt; Sure. This is our mortal life and this is where character is going to be built at. You're going to go through brother Bram said God doesn't just stick you through a pipe. You come out on the other end. That ain't how it happens. This is where character is molded. &gt;&gt; But listen, if you can read the book and says, "I'm going to win." &gt;&gt; And you get struck by cancer, you're going to win. &gt;&gt; You got a headache today, you're going to live. Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; My leg hurts. I don't know how I'm going to make it. You're going to make it to tomorrow. You're in chapter six. [Applause] Maybe you're watching this and you're right at the point of death. You still went. &gt;&gt; The doctors come in and said, "That's all I can do for you." You still went &gt;&gt; cuz there's another physician that's coming to see you. &gt;&gt; He's coming to see you. Are you with me now? He doesn't have an inoculation or some woo on you. God has the answer. &gt;&gt; You step from this body to a brand new body. This is a powerful quote to start out with. When the weakest of saints go on their knees, &gt;&gt; what a power and privilege has been given to the church of the living God. When you fall to your knees in prayer, even devils tremble. &gt;&gt; I want you to think about that. So the enemy that's been telling you you're nothing, nobody loves you, you're the weakest in this church, &gt;&gt; cuz he tells you those things. &gt;&gt; I want you to just to be remembered right now. You when you pray shake hell. &gt;&gt; That's not an Elvis Presley song. That's a promise by a prophet of God. You shake hell. &gt;&gt; When he took Jesus upon the mountain and he set him down, Jesus rebuked him again with the word, he defeated Satan with the word of God. Now watch this. showing that the weakest of Christian can defeat Satan with thus sayaeth the Lord. It is written, it is written. &gt;&gt; The prophet said, he says, God will never give you a promise unless first there is a deposit for it. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to behave. A good man wouldn't give you a check with no money in the bank. &gt;&gt; An honest man wouldn't. Well, God won't give you his check for salvation or healing unless there is a deposit for it. [Applause] And God's, don't take this wrong, God's not an Indian giver. &gt;&gt; Don't get racial on me. God's not someone that gives it to you and then takes it back. &gt;&gt; God gives it to you and it's yours. &gt;&gt; So, he gives you salvation and he's not going to decide 10 years later, I'm going to take that back. God promised Abraham, "I'm going to give you a child." &gt;&gt; That's all he had to have. And that settled it. &gt;&gt; God told you that you're going to be in a rapture. That settles it. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to behave up here. Come on. You don't have to behave back there. I'm giving you permission. [Music] [Applause] If God made a promise, God gave the promise and you just believe it. &gt;&gt; I don't care what takes place. It's yours. &gt;&gt; Fight the devil over every ounce of ground that he stands. He set stands on. Walk over it. Take it. &gt;&gt; Take the sword of the word. &gt;&gt; Oh, I love this. God's promises is true. Amen. &gt;&gt; Nothing can stop them. &gt;&gt; They're God's promise. And he gives us the promise of that just like he did to the children of Israel. &gt;&gt; The Pentecostal church has come to their Kadesh Barnea. And we are able. We can do it. Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, &gt;&gt; today and forever. &gt;&gt; I hear people say, "Well, you ought to have been here 15, 20 years ago, 30 years ago, 40 years ago. We really had a meeting." What about tonight? &gt;&gt; Sure, God was with us 40 years ago. Sure, we had a prophet just right down the street in 1958. But listen, that same God, &gt;&gt; that same God is here with us right now. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we miss things because we're looking for something. You ever talk to somebody that's always looking over your shoulder? I'm going to give you a little clue in life. If somebody's always looking over your shoulder, you're not important enough to spend a conversation with them. [Music] &gt;&gt; And so when somebody's looking over my shoulder, I simply walk away. &gt;&gt; Why, brother Ron? They're not taking the conversation personal, and I'm not the important person that they're wanting to see. So I just simply walk away. &gt;&gt; That's why when I go on my knees, I'm not thinking about Walt Disney. &gt;&gt; I'm talking to God. &gt;&gt; And God is first place in my life. Listen, God does not like yard sale stuff that you want to give him. He wants first place. &gt;&gt; Hey, this is this is it. This is it. Now, I want you to just think a couple of I want to I want to give you a couple powerful theme thoughts from the first church messenger Paul. And he writes it. This is the adoption chapter of the Bible in Ephesians. Let's go to Ephesians chapter 6 and verse 10. Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might. Notice what he does. Put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the ws of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, and against spiritual wickedness in high places. Wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand. stand. &gt;&gt; Amen. Therefore, having your loins girded about with truth, and having on the breastplate of the righteousness, and your feet shot with the preparation of the gospel of peace, and above all taking the shield of faith, wherewith you may be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked, and take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the spirit, which is the word of the of God, praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit, watching there into with all perseverance and supplication for all saints. Now, I want you to just notice Paul is writing this with inspiration. And it's a battle armor that he's got on. So, if we could look at history where Paul was when he's writing this, he is in a Roman dungeon. So the guy that is chained to him has got all of this armor on cuz Paul is a dangerous criminal cuz he's shaking hell. &gt;&gt; And listen, those soldiers fought to be able to guard Paul. He must have had a presence around him that they just wanted to be on. Maybe they was as tall as that guy, as strong as brother Denny. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But they were standing there and they were guarding hanging on his helmet. And Paul was saying, "I'm going to take that and make a sermon out of it." &gt;&gt; Cuz there's going to be believers down in the dark ages going to need this. &gt;&gt; There's going to be leotysan believers that are going to need this. &gt;&gt; Put on your shield. Put on your helmet. Grab a hold of your sword. And prayer is an atomic bomb. Use it. [Music] [Applause] Okay. So, Brother Brandham is going to preach on the rapture. Of all the scriptures that he picks, he's going to pick this one. Psalms chapter 27 and verse one. The Lord is my light and my salvation. Whom shall I fear? Fear is mentioned 600 times in the scripture. So it's a real thing. But for a believer, it don't matter. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Lord is the strength of my life. Of whom shall I be afraid? He's literally making fun of the devil. He's telling him, "I don't have to fear you. I don't have to be afraid of you. When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes came up onto me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell. Though a host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear. Though war should rise against me, and this will I be confident. One thing that I have desired of the Lord, that will I seek after, that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his temple. David is right. No matter what trials I come up against, I'm going to still go to church. But the devil will turn that on you. But you don't quit Walmart. &gt;&gt; Well, they're all a bunch of hypocrites there at church. You don't quit Walmart. You don't quit Kroger's. &gt;&gt; And I got news for you. We are not a congregation of angels. We are a congregation of believers. We all have a history here. News bulletin. We are all saved by the grace of Jesus Christ. Glory. Glory. Hang your wings in the wing closet. Take your halo off and hang it up back there. We are all &gt;&gt; saved by the grace of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Verse five, before I get in too much trouble. For in the time of trouble, &gt;&gt; cuz it's going to come, baby. For in the time of trouble, he shall hide me in his pavilion. In the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me, and he shall set me upon a rock. And now shall my head be lifted up above mine enemies, and roundabout thereof. Thereof will I will offer up in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy. I will sing. Yay, I will sing praises unto God. Unto the Lord. Here, oh Lord, when I cry with my voice. Those that don't pray, read the scripture with me. Here, oh Lord, when I cry with my voice, have mercy upon me and answer me. When thou saidest, "Seek ye my face, my heart said unto thee, thy face, Lord, will I seek. Hide not thy face far from me, and put not thy servant away in anger. Put thou hast been my help. Leave me not, neither forsake me, oh God of my salvation. When my father and mother forsake me, then the Lord will take me up. Teach me thy way, O Lord, and lead me into thy plain path because of mine enemies. Deliver me not over to the will of mine enemies, for false witnesses are risen up against me, and such as breathe out cruelty. All of that's went on. Notice he begins to explain where he's at. I had fainted unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living. &gt;&gt; Wait on the Lord and be of good courage. &gt;&gt; And he shall strengthen thine heart. Wait, I say on the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me give you a couple points. When you get in a hurry, you get a hold get ahead of God. So many people wanted the rapture to happen in 1977. But some of us needed to be born. &gt;&gt; Some of us needed to be born. Well, give me a scriptural preference. &gt;&gt; Abraham got ahead of God &gt;&gt; and he produced in his natural energies Ishmamail &gt;&gt; had he waited on God. &gt;&gt; Listen, Solomon was going to come through Basheba. David got ahead of God. &gt;&gt; This is a sermon for another day. But David was getting to the age that even his people that was with him said, "You fouled all of your battles. You fought. You fought. You've been a warrior. You've been a mighty man. Why don't you stay home &gt;&gt; and not go to church on Wednesday?" &gt;&gt; Why don't you stay at home? You don't need to go all the time. He stayed home, &gt;&gt; but he should have been at battle. &gt;&gt; If he'd have been at battle, he would not have been lusting. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Don't let your enemies talk you out of doing God's will. &gt;&gt; And when he was staying home, he got in trouble. &gt;&gt; What did it produce? a dead child. &gt;&gt; But God still had Solomon to come through that womb. &gt;&gt; Predestinated. He was going to come through there. But God would have provided a different way. But instead, he murdered a man. &gt;&gt; Our energies will get us in trouble. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother, I'm going to do the will of God if I have to do it myself. Yeah, you will. &gt;&gt; Yeah, you will. You'll get ahead of God and then you'll get in trouble. &gt;&gt; Minister, young minister walked up to me one night and he said, "I'm going to go down to that that that Pentecostal church and I'm going to introduce the message to him." And I just simply looked at him and I said, "Do that? You lose your wife, you lose your children, &gt;&gt; you'll walk away from the message. It was exactly, it happened exactly like I told him. &gt;&gt; He now sits in a message church alone cuz he did something he wasn't supposed to do. &gt;&gt; He thought, I'm going to do it. I'm going to go introduce. You don't go to a barroom &gt;&gt; to introduce the message. &gt;&gt; You get on the devil's grounds. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm going to go to that church. Introduce the message to him. Listen, let me just say, and it might be many times things that can happen, but let me just say this to you. As it turned out, there was his wife gone. There was his children gone. But it wasn't the right thing to do. Brother Ram says in victory day he said it seems like in the Christian life if a fellow is not absolutely centered on Christ the Christian life seems like it holds so many disappointments &gt;&gt; but those disappointments ments are God's divine will happening for us. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; What are they doing? Building character. &gt;&gt; Now, it don't seem like that it would be like that, but it's God's way of doing things. He lets us hit the river to see what we'll do. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? In identification, brother Bam says the word molds God's character to us. I thought this was incredible, a credible statement. A lot of times we're looking for truth in the wrong places. And I knew it. I knew it was accurate when I found this quote. And then brother brother Gabriel was sitting with us at breakfast this morning. He said, "I'm scared of all of these devotionals that these AI things are putting together &gt;&gt; because they're giving us things that we want to hear and they're bolding it to their own opinion." &gt;&gt; Come on. But the word molds God's character to us. Now remember Elisha, they didn't trim the robe to fit Elisha. &gt;&gt; God trimmed Elisha to fit the robe. &gt;&gt; We sing the song as a child. He's still working on me. and we're 80 years old and he's still working on us. &gt;&gt; He said he's molds God's character to us and anything that's tried to be mixed with character breaks that mold. And your character will not mix with the world. If you're being molded in the form of God by letting the mind of that was in Christ being in you, that's the control tower. Always take it back with the word. &gt;&gt; If it don't fit the word, don't do it. &gt;&gt; Brother D, I'm going make a statement. If you got a question to it, &gt;&gt; don't do it. &gt;&gt; If that dress is too thin, don't do it. Young men, if them pants are too tight, &gt;&gt; don't do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Matthew 16 and verse 18. And I say this unto you, that thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I will give unto you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. This is powerful words. And whatever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven. And whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. A good good place to bind and loose is Isaiah 53. Who hath believed our report unto whom is the arm of the Lord revealed. For he shall grow up him before him as a tender plant, as a root out of dry ground. He hath no form nor comeliness. And when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him. He is despised of and rejected of men, a man of sorrows, acquainted with grief, and we hid as it were our faces from him. And he was despised, and we esteemed him not. &gt;&gt; Surely he hath bore our griefs. &gt;&gt; Carried our sorrows. Yeah, we did esteem him shricken and smitten of God and afflicted. Let's read this next one. But he was wounded for our transgressions. He was bruised for our iniquities. The chastisement of our peace was upon him. And with his stripes, &gt;&gt; we sing the song, it's already done. 1 Corinthians chapter 15 verse 58. Therefore, my beloved brethren, be you steadfast. Let's read this together. Therefore, my beloved brethren, be you steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord. For as much that you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord. Jesus says in John chapter 14, he says, "Let not your heart be troubled." You could preach for years on what troubles your heart. And Jesus said, "Let not your heart be troubled." And let let me just take 30 seconds. He was standing before disciples. They were going to cut their heads off. They were going to be crucified upside down. &gt;&gt; You talking, you know, there's always scoffers says, "Is he the Lord? Is that Jesus? Is that really him?" Let me just say the proof was in the pudding. with these disciples. &gt;&gt; Once he's gone, when they come up against the most incredible adversity, Peter would say, "Don't crucify me like him. I'm not worthy of that. Turn me upside down." Listen, crucifixion was horrible as it was, but double the burden. &gt;&gt; Take my head off. Drag me through the street. These guys believed he was the Christ. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? They believed it with all their heart. &gt;&gt; Now, this sermon they've heard, "Let not your heart be troubled." &gt;&gt; Remember these words when they're getting ready to cut your head off. Remember these words when they put a lasso around your neck and you can Let not your heart be troubled. You believe in God, believe also in me. In my father's house are many mansions. Not brick and stone, but I got a body that looks just like yours, but it's young. It has no sin in it. &gt;&gt; And you're going to move from that body. I don't mind moving. &gt;&gt; I I want to give you a report. Don't cry when I die. &gt;&gt; Rejoice. I made it. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. As Billy Graham would say, "Don't cry for me. I'll be more alive there than I am here." &gt;&gt; In my father's house of many mansions, if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. &gt;&gt; And I go and prepare a place for you, and I will come again and receive you unto myself, that where I am, there you may be also. Revelation 1 and verse 17. Fear not. I am the first and the last. I am he that liveth and was dead. And behold, I am alive forever more and have the keys of death and hell. &gt;&gt; Did I say something make y'all mad? &gt;&gt; Did I say something turned your amens off? I feel like I'm talking to a radio broadcast. &gt;&gt; Turn to your neighbor and say, "I come to have church." &gt;&gt; You know, a preacher can feel that. &gt;&gt; I don't want y'all to go to a bar room and witness. I really don't want you to. There's better places to do that. You don't need to go to the Pentecostal church and witness the message. They turned it down a long time ago. &gt;&gt; That's where the spirit came in. So, I think I go back and cut that dude's head off. &gt;&gt; How powerful is my prayer? How powerful? My mother was a woman that she didn't scream. My mother was a kind of woman that prayed prayers that was a whisper. But I watched my mama's prayers shake hell. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So whether you scream or whether you whisper, &gt;&gt; pray. [Applause] Now, some of you have the ability and the gift to be able to pray to be able to pray for an hour. &gt;&gt; I doubt it, but some of you could probably do that. But some of you can pray for 45 seconds and shake hell. &gt;&gt; I want you to get the I want you to get it. &gt;&gt; Well, brother Ron, give me a scriptural reason. Peter is sinking in the water. He don't have a He don't have an hour to pray. &gt;&gt; So it means whatever you say to God, mean it. And if all you can do is help, [Applause] &gt;&gt; when I was burning in a fire, I screamed, "Help us, Jesus." &gt;&gt; When I was getting ready for brain surgery and he was pushing me down the aisle, I simply begin to pray aloud. And the man that was taking me down, I said, "God, you said we could break the chains and it would go from generations to generation." They say this cancer that I'm fighting come from my generations before. I'm praying that God break the chains. &gt;&gt; Don't let it fall on my children. Don't let it fall on my grandbabies. &gt;&gt; Come on, pray the prayer and mean what you're praying. Oh, brother Ron, that was just a prayer. Let me just say something. Prayers are generational. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They're generational. They're not just for your generation, but they're generation to your children and your children's children. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about power prayers. &gt;&gt; I don't want Titus I don't want Isaac to have to take chemo for years. &gt;&gt; Somebody ought to help me now. &gt;&gt; You don't want your children to fight the cycles of temper and anger and lust. Break a chains, &gt;&gt; brother Ron. But my my family had fought this and my family, let me just say, break the chain. &gt;&gt; You break it. You pray. Take God's word and break the chain off of your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't excuse the devil. Say, "Well, it's generational. I'm just going to get it. &gt;&gt; My daddy had a lust problem, so I guess I'm going to get it." Break the chain. &gt;&gt; Did you get it? Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said prayer changes things. &gt;&gt; Prayer is the most powerful weapon that was ever put in the control of human beings. Notice these next words. There's no atomic bomb or hydrogen bomb as powerful as prayer. People will watch this overseas. They don't know anything about our Civil War. &gt;&gt; We fought the Civil War right here. Right here where we're at, just up the road. Wars took place. Stonewall Jackson, you've heard of him. Stonewall Jackson had a headquarters right down here about a mile from this place. It's a brick building, brick house. They fought. They fought just right up here. Then they come right down, went to New Market and fought. They fought there. And And I'm not trying to tell you the battles. Stonewall Jackson became popular for the wars that happened right up here. We're no longer fighting that war. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; we're no longer fighting the war. They say that it was a racial war. That's only a cover up. It was about taxes and tariffs. Amen. &gt;&gt; The North would not allow the South to sell their goods without a monstrous tariff. &gt;&gt; They couldn't make a living. &gt;&gt; So they decided to fight. &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Ron, that's difficult." There's sometimes even in your Christian experience, you're going to have to man up or woman up on the devil. You're going to have to be a shamguard and say, "I've had enough. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to pass this down to my children." &gt;&gt; I've had enough. &gt;&gt; This is one of my favorite scriptures. Romans 8 and verse 31. What should we then say to these things? Now, in your closet, in your private times, I want you to remember this scripture. If God be for us, &gt;&gt; don't have a pity party in your closet. Don't have a pity party at your house. If God be for us, &gt;&gt; who can be against us? you pray at your home. Sister Tracy is a cleaner at my house. She comes once every two weeks I think is the schedule. She comes and she cleans in my office. She says many times when she's in our office in my office pray in my office cleaning she can feel her hair stand up because the presence of God that's in there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's because I pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. and God comes. You get the benefits of that. &gt;&gt; You get the benefits of those prayer times. &gt;&gt; If God be for us, &gt;&gt; who can be against us? &gt;&gt; He that spared not his own son, but delivered him up for us all. How shall he not with him freely give us all things? Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? &gt;&gt; It is God that justify. &gt;&gt; I'm going help you right here. Quit beating yourself for yesterday. &gt;&gt; We are not Catholics. We don't do purgatory. &gt;&gt; We don't pay for prayer. We don't count rosary beats. &gt;&gt; There is therefore now no condemnation to them. Amen. &gt;&gt; History is history. When you ask God to forgive you, [Music] &gt;&gt; God puts in the sea of God's forgetfulness, it's over. &gt;&gt; Now ask God to cleanse that from your mind. &gt;&gt; Who is he that condemnth? It is Christ that died, yay, rather is riven risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who maketh intercession for us. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or pearl sword? As it is written, for thy sake we're killed all the day long, or we're counted as sheep for the slaughter. Nay, in all these things, we are more than conquerors through him &gt;&gt; that loved us. For I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels, or prince of powers, or powers, or things present, or things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of Christ, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. &gt;&gt; For some of you, you might know this. Some of you might not know this. Have you ever wondered about what happened to the men that signed the Declaration of Independence? Five Signatures was captured by the British as traitors, tortured until they died. 12 had their homes ransacked and burned. Two lost their sons serving in the revolutionary armor armory. Another had two sons captured. Nine of the 56 fought and died from wounds of hardships of the Revolutionary War. They signed and privileged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor. What kind of men were these men that signed the Declaration of Independence? 24 were lawyers and jurist. 11 were merchants. Nine were farmers. Farmers with large plantations, men of means, men that were well educated. But they signed the Declaration of Independence knowing full well that the penalty would be death if they were captured. Carter Claxton of Virginia, a wealthy planter, a trader, saw his ships swept into the seas by the British. He sold his home and properties to pay his debts. And this man that was a millionaire died in rags. Thomas McKeen was so hounded by the British that he was forced to move his family almost conscially. He served in the Congress without pay and his family was kept in hiding. His possessions were taken from him and poverty was his reward. Vandals and soldiers looted the properties of of many of these men. I'm not going to take time to read all their names. Their homes were taken as headquarters. One of the homes was a home of Thomas Nelson. British General Cornwall Wallace had taken over his Nelson home for his headquarters. Here's what his response was. General Washington, General George Washington. He said, "Will you open fire on my house?" and that home was destroyed and Nelson would die bankrupt. He said, "But I would rather my home be destroyed than my enemy," Somebody ought to help me preach &gt;&gt; take over and rule inside of my house. [Applause] Francis Lewis had his home and his properties destroyed. The enemy jailed his wife and she died within a few months. John Hart was driven from the from his wife's bedside as she was dying. Their 13 children fled for their lives. His fields and his meal were laid to wa waste. No more than a year he lived in forest and caves, returning home to find his wife dead and his children vanished. Wow. They signed the Declaration of Independence. &gt;&gt; Here's what I wish. I wish that they would give me 25 minutes in Congress &gt;&gt; to remind them &gt;&gt; of where we come from. &gt;&gt; And I would tell them that every one of them are rotten and they've sold their soul &gt;&gt; for a pot of gold. These were men of integrity. &gt;&gt; That did not want to live in slavery. &gt;&gt; Folks, I don't want to miss the rapture. &gt;&gt; I don't want to be in a lukewarm condition and just get by. [Applause] They sealed their future by taking their pen and putting their name, not somebody else's name on that piece of paper. And I don't want to hurt nobody other country's feelings, but that's the reason we're not Germans today. &gt;&gt; That's the reason we can stand under that flag. She's rotten. Yes, she is. &gt;&gt; But she's still my natural homeland. I think it's incredible that John Hancock, we'd all know John Hancock by his name. But they asked John Hancock, why did he sign his name so big? He said, 'I signed my name large enough that the king would not need his glasses on to read who I was. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I come to the end of this message today and tell you I'm not signing the Declaration of Independence for this nation, &gt;&gt; but I want to remind you I am a child of God. I didn't come here to stay. I came from God and I'm going back to God. This world is not my home. I'm only passing through. Let me sign my name big enough until the King of Hell &gt;&gt; don't need his reading glasses on it. Put my name behind beside of Abraham and Moses and put my name beside of William Brandham. I am not ashamed. [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Sister Cassie, today be a good day to sing glory, glory, hallelujah, &gt;&gt; but I'm out of air, so I'm going to have to have Matthew to sing it for me. You may not know this, but brother Matthew's been asked to preach with us at brother Tom Rays at his camp this year. &gt;&gt; And he's going to be one of the speakers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother, are you proud?

Aren't you glad to be in the army of Almighty God? To be on a battlefield knowing that you got a weapon that has never been defeated, never will be defeated, and will still be the unconquered, victorious Jesus Christ throughout all of eternity. I say he's my champion. He's the greatest warrior that has ever put on this armor. And I'm fighting for a captain that will never lose. Well, whose side are you on, brother Andrew? I'm on the winning side. &gt;&gt; He said, say it like you're talking to your girlfriend. Put it back up there. Isaiah 41:10. Come on. Come on. &gt;&gt; Fear thou not, for I am with thee. &gt;&gt; It always It always makes me chuckle when you read Brother Brandham when he starts talking about faith has got big muscles and a hairy chest. It always makes me chuckle. You That's a homely looking guy right there, ain't it? Fear not. I am with thee. Now go in there tomorrow at your job and say, "Boss, look. I need to add some things to my resume. I can do all things. I This guy right here, can you imagine when Adam Frasier shows up at Rome dumpster Reynolds tomorrow and said, "Hey boss, I heard a preacher talking yesterday said I can do all things." And I say, you're absolutely right. Here's the employee of the year. We only got one, but it's for you, buddy. I can do all things through Christ who's strengthening me. And I just happen to believe it. It ain't me. It ain't how big I am, but it's who I believe in. I can do all things. Fear thou not, for I am with thee. Be not dismayed, for I am thy God. My girls right here never have to fear about some teenage pumpkin coming in there and trying to rob something away from them because they know they got a daddy that's packing more than just muscle. &gt;&gt; They know that I have some things that are hidden in a closet that can take care of some matters. And I never have to fear what Satan can pinch me in a corner with because I got a father that's got an open book. And he's armed and dangerous. Go ahead, show your muscles off, sisters. Y'all at FGLT, we ain't at some We ain't at some Church of Christ. We at FGLT. Go ahead and flex your muscles. Go ahead and flex your faith muscles at that devil and say, "Today is the last day." That's just a carnal muscle. But down on the inside of here, there is something bubbling on the inside of me that Satan's been trying to put out for over 18 years. And he has not been successful. But I'm still standing because I'm armed and dangerous. Matthew, you better sing cuz I'm happy. Go ahead. Worship the Lord a little bit. &gt;&gt; Oh, how can I forget what he's done for me?
