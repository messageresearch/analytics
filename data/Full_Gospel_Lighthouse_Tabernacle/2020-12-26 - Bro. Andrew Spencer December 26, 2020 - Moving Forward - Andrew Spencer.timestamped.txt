[49:12] six months before that i begin to feel a
[49:14] kind of a waning of my strength
[49:16] and then i'm then right in the christmas
[49:18] season i learned that i had
[49:20] i i would go to brother biscuits and
[49:23] even being at brother biscuits is where
[49:25] i learned that i had cancer in my lung
[49:27] and and then then within the coming
[49:30] months
[49:31] i would be with the doctors actually
[49:33] brother tim pruitt would go with me to
[49:34] the doctors
[49:35] and there i would learn that i had stage
[49:37] four cancer
[49:38] and i we was in for a very dark and
[49:41] difficult
[49:42] journey no way could i understand how
[49:45] difficult
[49:46] that people that suffer with cancer how
[49:49] difficult that can be
[49:51] you know sometimes in a diagnosis they
[49:53] say you might have cancer
[49:56] there's a quantum leap between you might
[49:59] have cancer
[50:00] and having cancer and then it's an
[50:04] incredible another leap
[50:06] to deal with it when it's stage four
[50:08] cancer and they say there'll be no end
[50:10] and this is a
[50:11] this is this is going to be how how you
[50:14] die in your life
[50:16] but from the very beginning we believe
[50:19] that god's our healer
[50:22] whether it was in our brain with three
[50:24] tumors and
[50:25] or within our lungs it was full of
[50:28] tumors
[50:29] or spread through our body cancer's just
[50:32] cancer
[50:34] and if we remember there was a
[50:35] conversation that our prophet had
[50:38] with the angel of the lord and it wasn't
[50:41] the angel the lord that brought up
[50:43] cancer it was brother branham that
[50:45] brought up cancer
[50:46] because this is the age of cancer it's a
[50:49] it's cancer
[50:50] something that takes over the good cells
[50:52] of your body and begins to destroy the
[50:55] life that was in you
[50:57] now satan sent his best from the
[50:59] quarters of hell
[51:02] because he knew what kind of a fighter
[51:04] that we was
[51:07] and we remember that brother branham
[51:08] said that that the devil can't touch a
[51:11] hair of your head
[51:12] until he first gets permission from god
[51:16] now he may shake you in a moment for you
[51:19] to be shaken
[51:21] but when you're really a child of god
[51:23] when you come to grips with it
[51:25] and when you come to grips that god's on
[51:28] my side
[51:29] and there's nothing that the devil can
[51:31] do until he's first got permission
[51:37] brother tim pruitt and brother donny
[51:38] reagan came and
[51:40] prayed for me in my home because with
[51:43] cancer
[51:44] this may be a help to somebody but with
[51:46] cancer there's a tormenting spirit that
[51:48] comes with it i'd like to report that
[51:51] that night
[51:52] god brought me a peace that has never
[51:55] left
[51:59] when brother wayne lawson was here i
[52:01] lost my vision to my left side
[52:04] and to where i can't see anything in the
[52:06] peripheral in both eyes
[52:08] because the tumor laid on the on the
[52:11] on the
[52:15] optical nerves that go around the back
[52:17] of your brain
[52:18] that tumor was about that that size
[52:22] and it was bleeding
[52:25] and as it wrapped around my optical
[52:27] nerves it caused me to go blind and
[52:29] that's what alerted
[52:30] it shows the devil is stupid
[52:34] if he would have left me not going blind
[52:36] that thing would have busted
[52:38] within just a few days and i've lost my
[52:41] life
[52:41] but he's crazy devil he calls me to go
[52:45] blind
[52:46] and while brother wayne lawson was here
[52:48] preaching
[52:49] it alerted to me that something was
[52:52] going on
[52:53] and i went to uva and through rigorous
[52:56] tests of
[52:57] of the entire entire day and week they
[53:00] found that
[53:00] that i had a tumor that was bleeding
[53:04] god sent us an anointed doctor to take
[53:06] care of that
[53:07] and was able to pull that tumor out of
[53:10] my brain
[53:11] couldn't operate on the other two
[53:12] because they're inoperable
[53:14] but but it took that tumor out of my
[53:16] brain
[53:17] and never gained the sight of seeing
[53:20] back
[53:22] to my left side but i've got an
[53:24] incredible chauffeur
[53:27] and she drives me everywhere that i need
[53:30] to go
[53:31] and the boys drive me and so i
[53:34] understand that important people have
[53:40] chauffeurs and you say well brother ron
[53:42] do you pray that your vision come back
[53:45] you know sometimes i i get disappointed
[53:48] that my vision is
[53:50] is is not there but i feel like a man
[53:53] that met the angel of the lord
[53:56] and the angel of the lord smote him in
[53:58] his thigh
[54:00] and he had a limp the rest of his life
[54:03] that is a reminder that god saved my
[54:05] life
[54:09] maybe others are going through
[54:10] incredible tests maybe it's not
[54:12] cancer brother ed in your congregation
[54:16] you've been an awesome audience brother
[54:18] harold and
[54:18] it's been my buddy for for decades now
[54:22] we've stood and preached camp meetings
[54:25] all over the place and
[54:28] and your church is like home to me
[54:32] brother sam fixes me the saskatoon pie
[54:36] i missed that this year but maybe in the
[54:38] coming years we can make that happen
[54:40] again
[54:41] but i believe that we're getting ready
[54:43] to step to another realm
[54:46] i was just at the doctor and i'll close
[54:48] with these things
[54:52] let me just say one more thing it was in
[54:55] about july the 4th that
[54:57] i was preaching here in this audience
[55:00] and i preached a sermon on i must get to
[55:02] jesus and let me just say this to you we
[55:05] all must get to jesus
[55:08] and in that sermon i i begin to speak of
[55:10] how people would travel
[55:11] 17 hours just to be in a brother branham
[55:14] service
[55:17] something hit me in the night as i went
[55:19] home and i was laying in bed something
[55:21] hit me
[55:24] there was some there were some things
[55:26] that brother tim was going to come to my
[55:28] place and
[55:30] or was i going to go to his place
[55:33] and it hit me that that was a 17-hour
[55:35] trip the doctors had told me not to
[55:38] travel
[55:39] but my boys decided they would get me to
[55:42] brother tim's
[55:44] i hadn't worked up to that time with the
[55:46] boys and
[55:48] and i was just i was my energy was
[55:50] waning my strength was leaving me
[55:53] and i thought i was coming to my end i
[55:56] honestly did that was my private
[55:58] thoughts
[55:59] i felt like that i was just i just i
[56:01] told sister connie i'm at a point to
[56:03] where
[56:04] i i don't know if i can keep keep going
[56:07] i think i'm gonna quit my treatments
[56:09] because it's just
[56:10] i just don't have energy and
[56:13] uh connie would pray and say lord
[56:17] he's he's got to have strength to keep
[56:19] his treatments going
[56:24] in the middle of the night god woke me
[56:26] up to travel to brother tim fruits
[56:29] and it was there that brother adam
[56:31] frazier received the holy ghost
[56:33] along with two other young men
[56:36] and i got a touch i didn't i didn't see
[56:40] a lightning bolt
[56:42] i didn't hear thunder but we prayed
[56:47] we made the trip back home and i was
[56:49] sick during some of that journey
[56:51] but i went to work from that point and i
[56:54] haven't missed a day
[56:56] since that with the boys
[56:59] i've been did my best i've missed some
[57:02] sundays but i've did my best to preach
[57:04] every sunday morning
[57:05] here in this audience because in the
[57:08] mornings i'm more alert
[57:10] in the night i get a little bit weary
[57:13] probably like some of you others that's
[57:14] got gray hair
[57:20] but god restored my strength
[57:24] in the midst of a death sentence
[57:27] in the midst of a death sentence god has
[57:30] had
[57:31] miracle after miracle after miracle
[57:36] i hope this doesn't take too long but i
[57:38] just went to the eye appointment the
[57:40] other day
[57:42] and the cancer that was in the eye
[57:45] it's gone
[57:58] the two cataracts that was on my eyes
[58:00] they're gone
[58:03] we thank god for that
[58:10] sister connie and i was at the doctor's
[58:12] appointment on monday
[58:14] and dr gone just looked at me and she
[58:16] said
[58:17] you are a miracle
[58:23] she said we consider you here at this
[58:25] cancer center
[58:28] our miracle amen
[58:32] i thank god for all the doctors and the
[58:34] nurses that have taken care of me
[58:37] i appreciate them with all my heart
[58:40] but the high physician
[58:44] gets all the credit
[58:51] brotherhood i'm more determined
[58:55] than ever before i'm more driven than
[58:58] ever before
[59:02] and faith in action
[59:05] i believe that i'll speak stronger than
[59:09] ever before
[59:11] with more clarity and more strength
[59:17] and by god's help i'm committed
[59:21] as i step into a new year whatever it
[59:24] holds for me
[59:26] whether it holds the rapture
[59:29] or i live to see next christmas
[59:32] i'm committed
[59:36] so no matter what excuse a person might
[59:38] have sitting in your audience or in this
[59:41] audience
[59:42] of why they can't serve the lord
[59:46] i want to encourage you
[59:52] you might be fighting some very
[59:54] difficult things
[59:58] but i want to encourage you to serve the
[1:00:00] lord

[1:05:02] a report that'll shake every devil in
[1:05:04] hell
[1:05:06] i'm still here when every odd was
[1:05:10] stacked up against
[1:05:12] ron spencer he's still here
[1:05:16] it's because there is a power on the
[1:05:18] inside of a bride that knows how to get
[1:05:20] in touch with her bridegroom
[1:05:22] and we say thank you lord we're very
[1:05:26] grateful
[1:05:27] you know i didn't have to get no gift
[1:05:30] this year didn't have to have anything
[1:05:31] just to have what we're standing we're
[1:05:33] standing behind this pulpit just a few
[1:05:35] seconds
[1:05:36] ago is worth more to me than life
[1:05:39] and i think about all the sermons that
[1:05:42] we've heard this past
[1:05:43] year and think about the eternal things
[1:05:45] that's happened
[1:05:47] those things can't be measured but we
[1:05:49] say thank the lord for him
[1:05:51] amen amen amen let's
[1:05:55] let's just go to the word this evening
[1:05:57] over to the book of philippians
[1:05:59] chapter 3 and verse 7.
[1:06:16] um
[1:06:30] amen
[1:06:34] philippians chapter 3 and verse 7
[1:06:38] but what things were gained to me those
[1:06:41] i counted
[1:06:42] lost for christ yay doubtless and i
[1:06:45] count
[1:06:46] all things but lost for the excellent
[1:06:48] sea of the knowledge of christ jesus my
[1:06:50] lord
[1:06:52] for whom i have suffered the loss of all
[1:06:54] things and do count them but dung that i
[1:06:56] might win
[1:06:56] christ and be found in him not having my
[1:06:59] own righteousness which is of the law
[1:07:01] but that which is through the faith
[1:07:04] of christ the righteousness which is of
[1:07:06] god
[1:07:07] by faith that i may know him in the
[1:07:10] power of his resurrection
[1:07:12] and the fellowship of his sufferings
[1:07:14] being made conformable
[1:07:16] unto his death if by if by any means
[1:07:19] that i might attain
[1:07:20] unto the resurrection of the dead not as
[1:07:24] though i had already attained either
[1:07:26] were already perfect but i follow after
[1:07:29] if that i may apprehend that for which i
[1:07:32] am
[1:07:32] also also i am apprehended of christ
[1:07:35] jesus
[1:07:36] brethren i count not myself to have
[1:07:39] apprehended but this one thing i do
[1:07:42] forgetting those things which are behind
[1:07:44] and reaching forth under those things
[1:07:46] which
[1:07:46] are before i press toward the mark for
[1:07:50] the prize of the high calling of god
[1:07:53] in christ jesus let's just speak to the
[1:07:56] author of the book just now father we
[1:07:58] come before you lord very humbled and
[1:08:01] very grateful
[1:08:01] father for the opportunity that we have

[1:08:09] praise and thanksgiving to flow forth
[1:08:12] from our life
[1:08:13] and to offer our life a living sacrifice
[1:08:15] unto you lord

[1:08:19] brought us from and what you have done
[1:08:20] for us lord
[1:08:22] god one more time we ask that you had
[1:08:24] spread forth your word of life before us
[1:08:26] that we might
[1:08:27] that we might press towards the mark oh
[1:08:29] god that we might
[1:08:31] apprehend those things which are before
[1:08:33] so god
[1:08:34] lord you know all things lord jesus you
[1:08:36] know everything that we've gone through
[1:08:38] this week you've seen the
[1:08:40] you've seen the accounts of this week
[1:08:42] the events of this week father
[1:08:44] how we were blessed father to be able to
[1:08:47] to say that we went through christmas
[1:08:49] one more time
[1:08:50] and lord jesus we're asking god that
[1:08:52] that you would just come and visit us
[1:08:54] with your presence here tonight
[1:08:56] lord we've already felt your presence
[1:08:59] and we've already sung the songs of zion
[1:09:01] we've already heard a testimony
[1:09:04] that'll shake goliath father and lord i
[1:09:07] pray tonight that you would just
[1:09:09] come lord with a word of encouragement
[1:09:11] and strength tonight

[1:09:14] give you praise in the name of jesus
[1:09:16] christ
[1:09:17] amen amen you can have your seats at
[1:09:20] this time
[1:09:23] we'd like to speak to you just for a
[1:09:25] moment on this thought of
[1:09:26] moving forward and we
[1:09:30] we know that we're just coming through
[1:09:31] the christmas season here and still in
[1:09:34] the
[1:09:34] in the in the prelude and in the season
[1:09:37] of christmas and the beginning of new
[1:09:39] year and
[1:09:40] and we know that that every every every
[1:09:43] year we always give a theme
[1:09:45] give a theme of what we are looking
[1:09:47] forward to
[1:09:48] into the next year of 2021 well i
[1:09:51] i this would be the last service that i
[1:09:53] would speak to you in 2020
[1:09:56] lord willing unless unless i would have
[1:09:58] to speak in the morning which i'm really
[1:10:00] hoping not to and
[1:10:04] but as we we always give though give our
[1:10:07] theme of what we're
[1:10:08] looking into and what we're what we're
[1:10:10] going to but i'm really hoping that we
[1:10:12] don't even have to go into 2021
[1:10:14] that we just go into a rapture but just
[1:10:18] moving forward as we as we have been
[1:10:21] taught by the prophet to always
[1:10:23] to occupy till he comes and and to move
[1:10:26] forward into things we
[1:10:28] i wanted to move forward in this theme
[1:10:30] of
[1:10:31] of moving forward and here we are we
[1:10:34] we preached to you this all past year
[1:10:37] 2020
[1:10:38] that god is with us and we will see
[1:10:40] miracles
[1:10:41] and we're not necessarily moving on from
[1:10:43] a fault or moving on from theme to theme
[1:10:46] but carrying on a thing that we're
[1:10:48] moving forward right into the book of
[1:10:50] acts right on with a continuation of a
[1:10:52] book of acts that
[1:10:53] that we will see miracles we will see
[1:10:56] giants fall we'll do the impossible
[1:10:59] and we're moving forward in the things
[1:11:01] that god has for us
[1:11:03] and looking in this christmas season and
[1:11:05] we we see and the things that are very
[1:11:07] relevant to our mind and
[1:11:09] that that christ that we look the very
[1:11:11] first view that we get of christ coming
[1:11:13] is is a babe in a manger and we
[1:11:16] we see him there in a manger and we see
[1:11:18] all the events that transpire
[1:11:20] the next event we see is him eight days
[1:11:23] old as he's being presented at the
[1:11:25] temple
[1:11:26] and and simeon that is that has been
[1:11:28] visited
[1:11:29] that that he is told that he will not
[1:11:30] see death until he sees the
[1:11:32] christ child then we see him as he's
[1:11:36] as christ is two years old and he's and
[1:11:38] he's standing there and there's
[1:11:40] men that have traveled from afar that
[1:11:42] they've brought they've been astrologers
[1:11:44] and
[1:11:45] and there's been a light that's been
[1:11:47] leading them for the past two years as
[1:11:49] as there's been a star that would rise
[1:11:51] out of jesse and
[1:11:53] and these men are bringing gifts that
[1:11:55] that mean something very significant to
[1:11:57] christ's coming of
[1:11:58] of gold and frankincense and myrrh and
[1:12:01] all of them
[1:12:01] representing his life and then we catch
[1:12:04] his next view between
[1:12:06] two years old we catch him at 12 years
[1:12:09] old
[1:12:09] we see him as he's standing there in a
[1:12:12] temple
[1:12:13] when his mother and his father's foster
[1:12:15] mother and father they take him to the
[1:12:17] temple
[1:12:17] at the at the feast of passover and they
[1:12:20] take him there
[1:12:21] and they move on without jesus and they
[1:12:24] they finally go
[1:12:25] into a spot and they realize that
[1:12:28] they've moved on without jesus
[1:12:30] and we find that that is where the
[1:12:32] pentecostal people are today
[1:12:35] they've moved on without jesus and they
[1:12:37] don't know where they left him at but
[1:12:39] they left him in 1956 when they rejected
[1:12:43] this message
[1:12:44] when they when pentecost himself they
[1:12:46] they rejected him
[1:12:48] but jesus when we see him when we see
[1:12:51] him as
[1:12:51] as mary and and joseph come running and
[1:12:54] they're seeking out their kin folk where
[1:12:56] is he at
[1:12:58] and they find him in the temple as he's
[1:13:01] standing there
[1:13:02] and he has as he has the men and the
[1:13:05] astrologers and the theologians of the
[1:13:07] day
[1:13:07] he has them astounded and he's teaching
[1:13:10] them about
[1:13:11] creation he's teaching them about life
[1:13:14] because here is the one
[1:13:16] they don't recognize it they don't see
[1:13:18] it but here he is a 12 year old boy
[1:13:21] and he's standing there and he's
[1:13:22] astounding the men of the
[1:13:24] eight the smartest men of the age but
[1:13:27] jesus did not
[1:13:28] stay as a baby in a manger he moved on
[1:13:33] he moved on from being a child that that
[1:13:36] met the wise men he moved on from being
[1:13:38] a 12 year old boy
[1:13:40] that would stand there and wreck and
[1:13:41] tell his mother that would tell his
[1:13:43] foster mother
[1:13:45] you knew that i would be about my
[1:13:46] father's business
[1:13:48] you knew that i would be here you didn't
[1:13:50] have to go searching for me everywhere
[1:13:52] else
[1:13:52] jesus rebuked her jesus rebuked her you
[1:13:56] know who i am
[1:13:57] you know what the angel said to you this
[1:13:59] is what i am sent to do
[1:14:02] but then there's a gap between 12
[1:14:05] and 30 years old that we don't see
[1:14:08] anything
[1:14:09] that jesus is doing and there's
[1:14:12] theologians of the day that would say
[1:14:14] that those are the lost years of christ
[1:14:16] we don't know where he was maybe he was
[1:14:18] over in ethiopia
[1:14:20] and he was studying out things but i
[1:14:22] want to say to you those things were not
[1:14:24] in vain
[1:14:25] you may have not seen jesus in those
[1:14:27] time you may not have seen him in
[1:14:29] history
[1:14:29] you may not have seen him in the bible
[1:14:32] between 12 and 30
[1:14:34] but there were things that were
[1:14:36] transpiring in jesus's life
[1:14:38] that led him to this spot but then he
[1:14:41] didn't just stay
[1:14:42] there he moved on into his ministry
[1:14:46] and let me say this to you there may be
[1:14:49] a short gap
[1:14:50] in somebody's life that you ain't seen
[1:14:52] them you ain't seen them for some time
[1:14:54] or
[1:14:55] you haven't seen them in church or you
[1:14:57] haven't seen you don't know what they're
[1:14:59] going through
[1:15:00] you don't know where they are but don't
[1:15:01] you write jesus off
[1:15:04] when jesus comes to his fulfillment
[1:15:06] he'll be exactly what he was but
[1:15:08] built to be but he's moving on
[1:15:12] and we watch as jesus goes as
[1:15:16] immediately we catch the view of jesus
[1:15:18] at 30 years old
[1:15:20] as he's coming down to the water as he's
[1:15:22] there's a man that's down there that
[1:15:24] they call him
[1:15:25] they call him the holy dunker down there
[1:15:28] as he's dunking people in the water
[1:15:30] and here jesus is making his way and
[1:15:33] john the baptist
[1:15:34] says this is the lamb of god that will
[1:15:38] take away the sins of the world
[1:15:40] jesus's ministry was moving
[1:15:43] from transition to transition
[1:15:46] and now he comes into fullness
[1:15:50] notice in jesus's first year of ministry
[1:15:53] there is such an attraction to his
[1:15:55] ministry
[1:15:57] because you see his first pool was
[1:16:00] bringing in the blind and the heart and
[1:16:01] all of those
[1:16:02] and there was a great attraction and
[1:16:04] miracles and signs and
[1:16:06] wonders were being done and then in a
[1:16:08] second in his second year of ministry
[1:16:10] there was a law there was kind of a
[1:16:12] there was kind of a decline as a prophet
[1:16:14] would say it's a law in his ministry
[1:16:16] and then in his third year they
[1:16:18] crucified him
[1:16:20] but jesus did not stay as a baby in a
[1:16:24] manger
[1:16:25] if you keep jesus in a manger you can't
[1:16:27] get jesus to the cross
[1:16:30] but he's not just wanting you to stay in
[1:16:33] your condition
[1:16:34] and your experience of you receiving the
[1:16:36] holy ghost 13 years ago
[1:16:38] he's wanting you to have a fresh
[1:16:40] experience
[1:16:42] a fresh revival 2020 was a great year
[1:16:46] we sing great miracles but this year
[1:16:49] coming
[1:16:50] we're going to see more than we ever
[1:16:52] seen before
[1:16:56] i believe that we're going to have more
[1:16:57] prodigals return
[1:16:59] than we've ever seen in our life i
[1:17:01] believe we're going to have more saved
[1:17:03] than we've ever seen in our life i
[1:17:05] believe it's the year
[1:17:08] it's the year of jubilee when we see
[1:17:11] when we see limbs come back on people
[1:17:14] when we see
[1:17:15] cancer driven out when we see
[1:17:18] doctors astonished like never before
[1:17:23] we're not just staying where we're at
[1:17:26] we're moving forward
[1:17:28] you see if you fail to move forward you
[1:17:31] are always going to live life and regret
[1:17:35] i've been a part being in the business
[1:17:37] world i've been a part of some very
[1:17:39] very high and intellectual meetings of
[1:17:42] multi-millionaires here
[1:17:44] and across the u.s of a setting great
[1:17:47] setting great meetings of people that
[1:17:49] that could buy
[1:17:50] every one of us with it with with all
[1:17:52] the money and just think it's chump
[1:17:54] change and i've stood there
[1:17:56] in great meetings with them and you can
[1:17:58] hear them say now now if i'd
[1:18:00] only done this if i only done this and
[1:18:03] they are sitting there
[1:18:04] telling you on a word of if if i'd have
[1:18:08] only done this
[1:18:09] if i only done this i'd have been here a
[1:18:11] little bit faster
[1:18:12] or if i'd only if i'd only made this
[1:18:15] business move i i could have got to the
[1:18:17] next step
[1:18:18] or if i'd only done this you know i've
[1:18:21] been a part of
[1:18:22] of some people's lives where they tell
[1:18:25] me you know if i'd
[1:18:26] only surrender to god just a little bit
[1:18:28] sooner
[1:18:29] if i'd only give in and gave him my
[1:18:32] heart
[1:18:33] just a little bit sooner you see if you
[1:18:36] fail to move forward you are always
[1:18:39] living life
[1:18:40] in a cycle of regrets
[1:18:44] haunted by decisions or what if
[1:18:49] what if i'd have surrendered what if i'd
[1:18:51] have came to the altar
[1:18:53] what if i were to really pray through
[1:18:54] that night what if i wouldn't have done
[1:18:56] that
[1:18:57] what if i wouldn't have done this
[1:18:59] tonight's tonight to stop with the what
[1:19:01] ifs
[1:19:02] and come to a commitment like never
[1:19:04] before and you dedicate
[1:19:06] that it's not what if anymore you can
[1:19:08] say that i
[1:19:09] met him face to face i'm moving on from
[1:19:13] this spot
[1:19:15] you see where israel always got in
[1:19:17] trouble is when they got
[1:19:18] comfortable where they are but the
[1:19:21] pillar of fire was
[1:19:23] always taking them forward
[1:19:27] are you with me now the prophet would
[1:19:30] say is that some time ago he said i read
[1:19:32] a story of
[1:19:33] of days of our nob he so one of the
[1:19:35] greatest presidents i think the nation
[1:19:37] ever had was
[1:19:38] was lincoln not because that he he come
[1:19:40] from kentucky but because he was a great
[1:19:43] man
[1:19:43] he was deprived of an education but yet
[1:19:46] was was something in his heart some
[1:19:48] purpose
[1:19:49] he said i like man of this and i like
[1:19:51] people that's got something they're
[1:19:52] fighting for
[1:19:54] not just lay around well whatever what
[1:19:56] comes along will be all right
[1:19:58] oh be up and at it and lincoln never let
[1:20:01] his education stand in the way
[1:20:03] he had something to do and i think every
[1:20:05] christian ought to be that way
[1:20:08] find your purpose and go do it
[1:20:12] find your purpose and go do it that's
[1:20:15] the way every christian life ought to be
[1:20:17] find what the will of god is step in it
[1:20:20] don't argue about it don't reason about
[1:20:22] it
[1:20:22] just step in men that ever amounted
[1:20:25] anything to anything in life
[1:20:27] was men that put their full trust in god
[1:20:31] when you look at the men of this nation
[1:20:32] when you got george washington
[1:20:34] when he's a leader of a leader of an
[1:20:36] army when his men ain't got shoes on
[1:20:39] their feet they
[1:20:40] they barely got enough weapons to get
[1:20:42] the job done they barely got enough
[1:20:44] clothes on them
[1:20:45] to get through the winter but there was
[1:20:47] a man
[1:20:48] that was perseverant that would that
[1:20:50] would pray all night
[1:20:53] through the snow through the wind he'd
[1:20:55] pray all night because
[1:20:56] he knew he knew that the delaware river
[1:21:00] was in front of him there were men like
[1:21:02] paul revere that would
[1:21:04] that would go out when they heard the
[1:21:06] message
[1:21:07] that the british was coming he wrote out
[1:21:10] with a message
[1:21:12] he wrote out with a message and told the
[1:21:14] whole city
[1:21:15] he told the poor he told the rich he
[1:21:18] told the farmer
[1:21:19] he told the businessman he told
[1:21:22] everybody
[1:21:23] and he saved this great nation because
[1:21:26] he took a message
[1:21:29] and he ran with a message he ran with a
[1:21:32] message
[1:21:32] and he saved this great nation
[1:21:37] oh hallelujah men like stonewall jackson
[1:21:41] that would stand there and the bullet
[1:21:43] fray was going around him the warframe
[1:21:45] was going around him
[1:21:47] and men would ask him how can you stand
[1:21:50] in the face of opposition like that
[1:21:52] he said there's not one time that a
[1:21:54] drink of water ever hits
[1:21:56] my lips unless i first thank god for
[1:21:58] that
[1:22:00] he was a man that knew how to pray and
[1:22:03] he could stand there in the face of
[1:22:04] opposition
[1:22:06] and he knew that there was not going to
[1:22:07] be one bullet that could take him
[1:22:10] off the scene unless god was willing to
[1:22:12] take him off the scene
[1:22:14] he was willing to stand there a man of
[1:22:17] courage a man of
[1:22:18] a man of fortitude that could stand
[1:22:20] there
[1:22:22] in the face of the opposition and not
[1:22:24] move backwards
[1:22:29] hallelujah
[1:22:33] i read this statement today and brother
[1:22:36] branham said in go
[1:22:37] tell he said if this heritage of god if
[1:22:39] this people that god died for if this
[1:22:41] church that's called by his name
[1:22:43] is ever to be saved if we've if we've
[1:22:45] got a messenger with a message
[1:22:48] from the throne we've got to have a
[1:22:50] messenger with a message from the
[1:22:52] from the throne to meet the challenge of
[1:22:54] this day
[1:22:56] i want to say to the church of the
[1:22:58] living god this message that you're
[1:23:00] packing
[1:23:01] is the message that will meet the
[1:23:03] challenge of goliath's post in this
[1:23:06] day i would like to say in record
[1:23:09] echo it from the natural realm william
[1:23:12] branham you did a great job
[1:23:15] heavens knew how great a job he did but
[1:23:18] from my standpoint
[1:23:20] i would like to say william bralam you
[1:23:22] ran well
[1:23:25] your message is the message that will
[1:23:27] finish off
[1:23:28] and cap off the bride's ministry
[1:23:32] hallelujah william branham couldn't let
[1:23:35] he couldn't let his ignorantly stand in
[1:23:37] the way but he didn't
[1:23:39] he couldn't let a seventh grade
[1:23:41] education stand in his way
[1:23:42] but he didn't he could let people that
[1:23:45] caught in the kentucky squad
[1:23:47] stand in his way but he didn't william
[1:23:50] branham was a prince amongst men
[1:23:52] stood with the great stood with the
[1:23:54] presidents stood with men that were
[1:23:57] statures above him in education but they
[1:24:00] could not hold a candle
[1:24:01] to the ministry that he was packing
[1:24:05] but he didn't just let an education stop
[1:24:08] him
[1:24:09] he took a message though he didn't have
[1:24:12] an education
[1:24:13] though he didn't have great money but
[1:24:16] this was a kentucky man
[1:24:18] that could take a message around the
[1:24:19] world and could relate to every person
[1:24:26] he didn't let his trouble stand in front
[1:24:29] of him
[1:24:30] he didn't let his little girl passing
[1:24:32] away stand in front of him
[1:24:33] very much on the contrary
[1:24:37] you see satan thinks that he's punched
[1:24:39] at you
[1:24:40] and he thinks he's put an end to your
[1:24:42] ministry
[1:24:45] can i call your life a ministry he
[1:24:48] thinks he's got a punch on you and he's
[1:24:50] into your ministry
[1:24:51] your life he thinks he's got to stop on
[1:24:54] you
[1:24:55] but what he don't realize that what he's
[1:24:58] doing
[1:24:58] in your life what he's what he's
[1:25:00] tempting you by what he's
[1:25:01] what he's putting you through is only to
[1:25:04] bring glory
[1:25:05] to the god of heaven
[1:25:08] satan thought that he would make william
[1:25:11] branham
[1:25:12] curse god because he saw his little girl
[1:25:15] being ripped away from his life
[1:25:18] make her cross out make her get to such
[1:25:22] a spot in her
[1:25:22] life that she couldn't recognize in my
[1:25:26] eyes turning flies landing on her
[1:25:29] but what he didn't realize is that
[1:25:31] william branham
[1:25:33] would look on every cross-eyed case
[1:25:36] and every single time that this prophet
[1:25:39] of god
[1:25:40] would see across our child it would not
[1:25:42] be one time that they didn't walk away
[1:25:44] completely whole
[1:25:46] when satan thinks he's got a punch on
[1:25:48] your life
[1:25:49] it's only for the destruction of his
[1:25:52] kingdom he's
[1:25:54] only working things out for his own
[1:25:56] destruction
[1:26:00] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:26:05] there's a lot of people that are filled
[1:26:06] with education
[1:26:08] but never do anything with it i know a
[1:26:11] lot of people that are sitting
[1:26:13] sitting with degrees all around america
[1:26:16] filled with ideas
[1:26:18] but they lack the courage and the
[1:26:19] fortitude to execute
[1:26:22] there's a lot of people that could tell
[1:26:24] you how to live right but they can't
[1:26:26] live like themselves
[1:26:27] there's a lot of people that could tell
[1:26:29] me how to preach but they ain't never
[1:26:31] met the same god that i met
[1:26:33] there's a lot of men that could tell you
[1:26:36] what to do and what not to do
[1:26:37] but they ain't got the courage to stand
[1:26:40] toe to toe with the devil face to face
[1:26:43] there's a lot of people that's got ideas
[1:26:45] just because they made just because they
[1:26:47] make it they got brains
[1:26:48] or they got a degree don't make them
[1:26:49] smart
[1:26:52] hallelujah there's a lot of people
[1:26:54] that's got the idea what to do with this
[1:26:56] message
[1:26:57] and they can't run with it but god knows
[1:26:59] exactly who will run with this message
[1:27:02] he knows who he can trust with it and he
[1:27:04] knows who will get the message out
[1:27:07] if paul revere could stand there and say
[1:27:10] the british is coming
[1:27:11] let andrew spencer let the bride of
[1:27:14] jesus christ say
[1:27:15] jesus is coming
[1:27:27] abraham had every excuse in front of him
[1:27:30] but he didn't let it stop him from
[1:27:32] moving forward
[1:27:34] abraham had 25 years of failures in
[1:27:37] front of him
[1:27:38] but he kept pushing towards that promise
[1:27:41] israel had a promised land that was
[1:27:43] promised to her but she had to fight
[1:27:46] for it you've got a rapture in front of
[1:27:49] you
[1:27:50] but you got to live through laodicea
[1:27:52] overcome through laodicea
[1:27:54] to make it
[1:27:58] if you say well you know what i'm just
[1:28:00] going to put the jets on and i'm just
[1:28:01] going to relax through laodicea
[1:28:03] you will not be an overcomer
[1:28:07] you might overcome in your house and you
[1:28:09] might build yourself a bunker
[1:28:11] 50 feet deep you say i'm living the life
[1:28:14] no devil can get me down here living
[1:28:17] like a hermit don't make you an
[1:28:18] overcomer
[1:28:21] and going out and laying at a bar joint
[1:28:24] don't make you an overcomer
[1:28:25] an overcomer means that you can stand
[1:28:28] through the temptations of life
[1:28:30] and when satan comes against you just
[1:28:32] because he tempts you
[1:28:34] does not mean that you sinned
[1:28:37] he can tempt you all you want but when
[1:28:40] you give into it then it's saying
[1:28:43] hallelujah but the overcomer is the one
[1:28:46] when satan says you're gonna take
[1:28:48] another drink of this
[1:28:49] and he said not today satan
[1:28:53] you're gonna fall you're gonna listen to
[1:28:55] this denominational message
[1:28:57] and it'll take you out there and you'll
[1:28:59] say not today satan
[1:29:01] i'll stick with jesus
[1:29:05] an overcomer is somebody
[1:29:09] that's willing to press the battle
[1:29:13] somebody that's willing to give their
[1:29:14] all somebody that's willing to fight
[1:29:19] everybody with love everybody would love
[1:29:21] to be like that quote brother brandon
[1:29:23] would talk about he said
[1:29:24] now god don't make you an overcomer by
[1:29:26] pushing putting you in a pipe and
[1:29:28] pushing you through it he said that
[1:29:29] don't make you an overcomer
[1:29:30] you gotta fight for it
[1:29:37] blind bartimaeus had to fight past the
[1:29:40] crowd
[1:29:42] when everybody told him to be quiet
[1:29:47] he's done pasture
[1:29:52] how many times i wonder how many blind
[1:29:54] bartimaeus be sitting here or be
[1:29:56] listening around the world
[1:29:58] they've been told you just be quiet
[1:30:02] this is a time where you don't speak
[1:30:05] this is a time when when jesus is done
[1:30:08] past you
[1:30:09] but there's some blind bartimaeuses that
[1:30:11] are sitting here
[1:30:12] that would say that son of david have
[1:30:15] mercy on me
[1:30:18] i'd say if these walls could talk your
[1:30:20] life could speak
[1:30:21] it would testify that there's blind
[1:30:23] bartimaeuses setting all around the
[1:30:25] world
[1:30:26] that persevered and pressed past what
[1:30:29] the people said notice
[1:30:35] you can never go forward until you're
[1:30:37] perfectly satisfied
[1:30:39] and know without a shadow of a doubt
[1:30:40] that you're walking in god's will
[1:30:43] and then when you know that you're in
[1:30:44] god's will
[1:30:46] and walking in his way nothing can stop
[1:30:48] you
[1:30:49] because you know where you're standing
[1:30:51] you know the way you're going
[1:30:53] you know what you got in your mind and
[1:30:55] you know what the will of god is
[1:30:57] then you can do it
[1:31:00] then you can do it
[1:31:04] life is what you make it
[1:31:08] are you with me that life is what you
[1:31:09] make it
[1:31:11] your issues are what they what you make
[1:31:13] it your problems are what you make it
[1:31:17] this gospel is what you make it
[1:31:21] god is what you make him
[1:31:25] you can either let your mountains be
[1:31:27] bigger than your god
[1:31:28] or you can let god be bigger than your
[1:31:30] mountains
[1:31:31] because he really is bigger than your
[1:31:33] mountains
[1:31:34] life is what you make it you can either
[1:31:38] stay in the condition you're in
[1:31:40] or you can choose to move forward
[1:31:46] i remember when i was i was in high
[1:31:50] school football and
[1:31:51] i'd never played football before
[1:31:55] i didn't get all the size that matthew
[1:31:57] got
[1:31:59] he took all the steak and the taters and
[1:32:01] left me with ice cream
[1:32:05] i remember i remember i had a coach
[1:32:08] coach bill hale had a great influence on
[1:32:10] my life and
[1:32:12] i don't speak people the same way
[1:32:14] without him coming up in my life the way
[1:32:16] i speak to people because he had a great
[1:32:17] influence in my life and
[1:32:19] maybe don't even know how great the
[1:32:20] influence he had but i remember one time
[1:32:23] i was uh
[1:32:24] i was training in run running back
[1:32:26] position i didn't have no size
[1:32:28] it really wasn't that fast but i just
[1:32:30] had enough redhead there being enough
[1:32:31] fire on the inside of me that they would
[1:32:32] put me in every once in a while
[1:32:35] i was always happy to score against
[1:32:36] spotswood anyway
[1:32:38] and uh but i it seems like they trained
[1:32:41] me for that
[1:32:42] that one time i remember we were running
[1:32:46] this we were running this uh this
[1:32:48] course we were trying we were trying to
[1:32:49] get this drill down and they kept
[1:32:51] they che they just coached coach hale
[1:32:53] kept putting me through this thing and
[1:32:55] kept putting me through it and you know
[1:32:56] sometimes maybe your y'all's body's a
[1:32:58] little bit different than mine but my
[1:33:00] body wouldn't follow what my brain was
[1:33:01] telling it to do
[1:33:03] and i just kept going through the
[1:33:04] motions and trying to do the thing and i
[1:33:06] kept failing at what i was doing
[1:33:08] and coach hale come to me said he
[1:33:10] grabbed me by the helmet
[1:33:12] he said you're going to get this one way
[1:33:13] or another and every time i'd fail he'd
[1:33:15] make me get down
[1:33:16] give him five push-ups
[1:33:20] we'd run through it again i'd fail and
[1:33:22] he'd make me do do five push-ups
[1:33:24] he grabbed me by the helmet said spencer
[1:33:27] you're gonna get this thing one way or
[1:33:29] another
[1:33:29] and if you don't get it you're gonna be
[1:33:31] able to push up the house before soon
[1:33:35] well i finally got it i finally figured
[1:33:37] out what i was doing and what i need to
[1:33:39] do
[1:33:41] and he come over he said you know i
[1:33:43] still like you don't you
[1:33:46] you see i couldn't move forward in the
[1:33:49] condition of making mistakes all the
[1:33:51] time
[1:33:53] i could never bring forth the goal that
[1:33:56] he was setting before me
[1:33:58] because i kept shutting it down in my
[1:34:00] brain and my body wouldn't follow it
[1:34:03] now god's got a great big plan in front
[1:34:06] of us
[1:34:06] and sometimes the body wants to shut
[1:34:08] down
[1:34:10] and don't want to come to the goal that
[1:34:11] he's got before us
[1:34:16] covet has tried to shut down the body
[1:34:18] from getting to the goal
[1:34:20] fear has tried to stop the body from
[1:34:23] getting to faith
[1:34:25] but god is going to get that body
[1:34:29] exactly where he wants it so that it'll
[1:34:31] line up
[1:34:33] hallelujah what kovitt don't realize
[1:34:37] is that it's making the bride of jesus
[1:34:39] christ stronger
[1:34:42] kovitz just the name of a demon so
[1:34:44] cancer
[1:34:45] don't even know what it's doing it's
[1:34:47] just making the bride of jesus stronger
[1:34:50] sickness don't want to know what it's
[1:34:52] doing
[1:34:53] [Applause]
[1:34:58] notice the day that we're living in the
[1:35:00] hour of the time the church ought to be
[1:35:02] going forward instead it's going
[1:35:03] backwards
[1:35:04] that's right you can't you're if you're
[1:35:06] not going forward
[1:35:07] you're going backwards and god don't
[1:35:09] want his church to go backwards or set
[1:35:11] steel
[1:35:12] he wants us to go forward and don't
[1:35:13] slack at all the holy spirit don't say
[1:35:16] slack up here and
[1:35:17] wait a few years he said go forward
[1:35:20] constantly all the time and move on
[1:35:23] life's wife got in trouble once you look
[1:35:27] back
[1:35:29] jesus said that no man having put his
[1:35:32] hand to the plow and looking back is fit
[1:35:34] for the kingdom of god
[1:35:36] any man that starts a job and don't
[1:35:38] finish it ain't got very much account in
[1:35:41] my book
[1:35:43] a man that says he's going to live for
[1:35:45] god and then goes out and serves the
[1:35:46] devil all week and wants to come back
[1:35:48] and serve god on the weekend
[1:35:50] ain't very much man in my book
[1:35:55] a man there a family that calls him a
[1:35:58] ceo christian
[1:35:59] christian a ceo christian a christmas
[1:36:02] and easter only christian
[1:36:03] that ain't a very much christian in my
[1:36:05] book
[1:36:08] a man that only wants to serve god when
[1:36:10] he's sick ain't very much man in my book
[1:36:14] a man that's only serving god because he
[1:36:16] puts his ties in and god pours back and
[1:36:18] he don't want the baptism of the holy
[1:36:20] ghost
[1:36:20] he ain't very much man in my book you'll
[1:36:23] find out tonight whether you're in my
[1:36:25] book or not
[1:36:28] but a man that says whether god gives
[1:36:31] or god takes away i'm still going to
[1:36:33] serve him
[1:36:34] that's a man when a woman says hey i
[1:36:37] ain't got very much money in the bank
[1:36:38] but i'm still going to pray to god
[1:36:40] even when i don't see him when they
[1:36:42] don't give me anything
[1:36:43] when he does give me something i'm still
[1:36:45] going to serve him that's a real woman
[1:36:47] in my book
[1:36:50] they don't let failure stop them from
[1:36:53] moving forward in the faith
[1:36:58] a prophet would preach a sermon in 1964
[1:37:01] on going beyond the camp and he would
[1:37:03] grab it from hebrews 13 and 10 when when
[1:37:05] jesus
[1:37:06] when jesus suffered without the gate and
[1:37:08] suffer without the camp
[1:37:10] and he brings in that that moses that
[1:37:13] moses could never
[1:37:14] he could never go forward until we got
[1:37:18] out of the camp of egypt
[1:37:20] that moses had to get out of the camp
[1:37:22] that he'd been living in
[1:37:23] to do these things because he he'd been
[1:37:25] down there with a whole army and
[1:37:27] couldn't do it
[1:37:28] with all the armies of egypt he couldn't
[1:37:29] do it but one day god invited him
[1:37:32] into his camp you see that's where it
[1:37:35] makes all the difference in our life
[1:37:39] is when god invites us over
[1:37:42] you've heard the invitation come on over
[1:37:46] come on over to this side
[1:37:49] and israel had to make a move they moved
[1:37:52] them out in the wilderness and they
[1:37:54] they left their natural camp they left
[1:37:56] the mud camp they
[1:37:57] they left the camp made with straw and
[1:37:59] brick to dwell in tents out in the
[1:38:01] wilderness
[1:38:02] where there was no grain or nothing else
[1:38:04] and sometimes god asked us to do foolish
[1:38:06] things to our own thinking
[1:38:08] and if you ever leave the camp of your
[1:38:10] own reasoning
[1:38:12] that's the place that you'll find god
[1:38:19] you can only go beyond the camp
[1:38:22] you see a lot of people they they get in
[1:38:24] their mind of well this has got to
[1:38:26] happen or
[1:38:27] this has got to transpire for this to
[1:38:29] happen and they're so caught up in the
[1:38:31] reasonings of
[1:38:32] that god's got to jump through this
[1:38:34] hooper i've got to go through this
[1:38:36] and you got to get past your own you got
[1:38:38] to go beyond the camp
[1:38:41] jesus jesus went
[1:38:44] beyond the camp he went beyond what the
[1:38:47] sadducees and the pharisees were saying
[1:38:49] of him
[1:38:54] and you got to go beyond what the church
[1:38:56] world says of you
[1:38:58] you got to go home beyond what the world
[1:39:00] says of you
[1:39:03] and you got to even go on beyond what
[1:39:05] even church members say of you
[1:39:10] you got to have a fresh fire
[1:39:14] you can't get warm by moses as far
[1:39:17] you can't get warm by paul's fire
[1:39:21] but you got to go on to where the living
[1:39:23] god is in the camp
[1:39:26] he would preach a sermon called broken
[1:39:28] sister
[1:39:30] speak about those stagnated waters speak
[1:39:33] about those wiggle tails in those waters
[1:39:38] i'm afraid that sometimes that we allow
[1:39:40] our experience to slow down
[1:39:43] we allow things to just come in and we
[1:39:46] take in the gutters of
[1:39:47] life we take in the waters of life
[1:39:49] coming off off the gutters
[1:39:51] and they let anything into our
[1:39:52] experience we let sin in our experience
[1:39:54] we
[1:39:55] we let unbelief into our experience but
[1:39:57] the prophet would tell us about a little
[1:39:59] stream that was
[1:40:00] that was always bubbling whether he
[1:40:03] drank from it or whether
[1:40:05] deer drank from it it was always
[1:40:06] bubbling
[1:40:08] and it was something that that was
[1:40:10] pushing him that would always make him
[1:40:12] bubble
[1:40:13] and you he told us in that sermon that
[1:40:16] an artist and well never freezes up
[1:40:20] that sister and experience it'll freeze
[1:40:22] up on you
[1:40:23] everybody here that's living in virginia
[1:40:27] if you got pets you got to go out and
[1:40:29] kick the bucket
[1:40:31] to get the water to break right now
[1:40:35] but if there's some heat in that water
[1:40:37] you won't have to break that water
[1:40:40] if you just get a little fire
[1:40:44] if you just get a little fire behind
[1:40:46] that water
[1:40:47] it'll make it bubble if you ever get
[1:40:50] this old pentecostal experience that the
[1:40:53] people want to talk about today
[1:40:55] that those days are going by it's not
[1:40:57] about pentecost two thousand years ago
[1:41:00] it's about pentecost right now
[1:41:06] you can either stay in egypt or you can
[1:41:10] go into a wilderness
[1:41:11] where things are hard to believe or
[1:41:14] things you don't understand
[1:41:18] when you get out there that's where
[1:41:19] miracles are produced
[1:41:24] you can stay out in a world where they
[1:41:25] can explain everything
[1:41:28] or you can come here where miracles
[1:41:32] are not just every once in a while but
[1:41:34] an everyday occurrence
[1:41:37] they got a man sitting here you got a
[1:41:40] man sitting here that's an absolute
[1:41:41] miracle to be living
[1:41:45] take a man by justin klein by the name
[1:41:47] of justin klein
[1:41:48] that an enemy said that he was going to
[1:41:50] kill him to kill a cop that night
[1:41:52] but the angel the lord stood up for him
[1:41:56] stood in his way of five bullets that
[1:41:58] had every had every attention of killing
[1:42:01] that man
[1:42:03] but satan couldn't kill him because
[1:42:06] there was a little boy named silas
[1:42:08] that still had to come forth and satan
[1:42:12] thought that he would throw a blockade
[1:42:14] in front of the miracle of coming
[1:42:18] but there was an angel said that you're
[1:42:21] not
[1:42:21] coming no further
[1:42:28] hallelujah
[1:42:34] you got every reason you got every
[1:42:37] reason to press the battle
[1:42:40] you got every reason to move forward you
[1:42:43] got
[1:42:43] every reason to believe in miracles you
[1:42:46] got every reason to press forward
[1:42:48] you got every reason to believe in his
[1:42:50] name
[1:42:53] are you with me you're not the children
[1:42:55] of night
[1:42:56] you're the children of the day you were
[1:42:59] not predetermined
[1:43:00] so that you would live through laodicea
[1:43:03] and fell in laodicea
[1:43:04] but you'd move forward through laodicea
[1:43:07] and you come out on the other side not
[1:43:10] like judas
[1:43:11] but you come out on the other side when
[1:43:13] peter thought that they never
[1:43:15] when people thought that peter would
[1:43:16] never go forward
[1:43:18] they said that he'll be known as the man
[1:43:20] that denied jesus
[1:43:21] as a man that cussed that in his
[1:43:23] presence and said he didn't even know
[1:43:25] him
[1:43:25] he was a man that would stand there and
[1:43:29] give the inauguration speech
[1:43:36] paul would say in first thessalonians
[1:43:39] five and four
[1:43:42] go back to verse three but but for for
[1:43:45] when they
[1:43:46] shall say peace and safety then sudden
[1:43:48] destruction cometh upon them as travail
[1:43:51] upon a woman with
[1:43:52] child and they shall not escape but
[1:43:54] brethren ye are not in darkness
[1:43:56] that that day should overtake you as a
[1:43:58] thief but ye are the children of the
[1:44:00] light and the children of the day
[1:44:02] we are not of the night nor of darkness
[1:44:04] therefore let us not sleep
[1:44:06] as do others but let us watch and be
[1:44:08] sober
[1:44:09] for they that sleep sleep in the night
[1:44:12] and they that are drunken
[1:44:13] are drunken in the night but let us who
[1:44:16] are of the day be sober putting on the
[1:44:19] breastplate of faith and love
[1:44:21] for a helmet the hope of salvation for
[1:44:24] god and not other pointed us to wrath
[1:44:26] but to obtain salvation by our lord
[1:44:28] jesus christ
[1:44:32] what brought you here what got you here
[1:44:37] something makes you get out of your car
[1:44:39] on a freezing cold night
[1:44:41] something makes you spend your money to
[1:44:44] be in the service
[1:44:45] something made you come and drive miles
[1:44:48] upon miles
[1:44:50] just to hear a voice what's driving you
[1:44:54] what's pushing you there's something
[1:44:58] laying there that you don't see
[1:45:00] it's that germ of life that's always
[1:45:04] pressing you forward
[1:45:10] and you look at rahab's life she'd let
[1:45:13] men in before
[1:45:16] but what was different about these two
[1:45:18] men
[1:45:19] why would she believe these two men why
[1:45:22] would she drop down a scarlet cord
[1:45:25] why would she trust them because
[1:45:27] something was pressing her forward
[1:45:30] why would ruth let a man tell her to
[1:45:32] stay in this field
[1:45:35] when everybody else was around and when
[1:45:37] the wheat was growing low
[1:45:39] when everything seemed like it was going
[1:45:41] impossible steak
[1:45:42] why would she listen to this man
[1:45:47] she had failures come by her way she had
[1:45:49] destruction come by her way
[1:45:51] but something was pressing her forward
[1:45:54] why would esther
[1:45:56] go into a palace that she knew
[1:46:00] she knew that if she went in there and
[1:46:02] the king didn't extend her scepter
[1:46:04] that she was rightfully dead what would
[1:46:07] press her into that
[1:46:08] into that court hallelujah
[1:46:13] what would press taymor to play the
[1:46:15] heart the part of a harlot
[1:46:18] when her husband died when his brothers
[1:46:21] wouldn't wouldn't
[1:46:22] wouldn't give her seed you understand
[1:46:24] what i'm saying
[1:46:26] what would press her to play the part of
[1:46:29] a harlot
[1:46:31] what would press her to say i've got to
[1:46:34] dress this way
[1:46:35] i've got to act this way so that i can
[1:46:37] receive seed
[1:46:40] that i might live can i dare say that
[1:46:42] redemption was at work
[1:46:45] that the ladies of grace that fill in
[1:46:47] the lineage of jesus christ
[1:46:49] that redemption was at work
[1:46:54] the tamar had to push forward
[1:46:58] it didn't make sense
[1:47:02] it didn't make sense to the message
[1:47:04] community what she was doing
[1:47:06] but redemption was pushing her to the
[1:47:08] spot
[1:47:11] that if she don't fulfill this part that
[1:47:14] the lineage of jesus christ
[1:47:16] is inadequate but there was something on
[1:47:19] the inside of her
[1:47:20] that was pressing her to receive seed
[1:47:24] what made you go out there and see see
[1:47:27] that man hear that message you've heard
[1:47:29] a great lot of speaking
[1:47:30] throughout the years but what made you
[1:47:33] listen to that voice
[1:47:35] what got your attention this is more
[1:47:38] than a man
[1:47:39] this is more than a prophet there's an
[1:47:41] angel with this message
[1:47:43] there's something different about the
[1:47:45] way he speaks good evening friends
[1:47:48] there's something different when he
[1:47:49] speaks to a patient
[1:47:51] and he recognizes now is this the basic
[1:47:55] there's something different about this
[1:47:57] man what's driving you
[1:48:00] when the rest of the world reasons and
[1:48:03] says we don't need it
[1:48:05] when the rest of the world says it was
[1:48:07] just a gift
[1:48:08] what is pushing you to hear this voice
[1:48:14] there's something on the inside of you
[1:48:18] that has to be extracted by the evening
[1:48:21] light
[1:48:23] what was driving tamar forward
[1:48:26] redemption was at work
[1:48:31] when you look at jesus's beginning of
[1:48:32] his ministry you look at luke chapter
[1:48:35] three
[1:48:36] and then you look at the lineage how it
[1:48:39] came down
[1:48:40] as it goes in reverse all the way to the
[1:48:42] end of chapter three
[1:48:44] how it came from jesus to david
[1:48:48] to obed jesse and all down through the
[1:48:51] lineage
[1:48:52] of seth there's adam and all these
[1:48:56] were the sons of god
[1:49:00] that there was something greater that
[1:49:02] work than the natural man could look at
[1:49:06] it was looking past what you see and
[1:49:09] thinking past what you think
[1:49:12] that the word of god was going to find a
[1:49:14] wound
[1:49:15] and it was going to bring forth life
[1:49:20] what would cause twins to fight in a
[1:49:23] woman
[1:49:27] when jacob looked at the birthright and
[1:49:30] said it's worth fighting for
[1:49:33] when tamar would produce twins
[1:49:36] and pharaohs and sarah when they were
[1:49:39] coming forth from the womb
[1:49:41] sarah broke his hand out first fourth
[1:49:43] and the and the handmaid and
[1:49:44] wrapped a scarlet cord around his hand
[1:49:46] and said this one came forth first
[1:49:49] and then he drawed his hand back
[1:49:53] and fair ass came forth first and said
[1:49:56] this breach be upon you
[1:49:59] but something was driving him
[1:50:02] driving him to a birthright something
[1:50:05] was pushing him
[1:50:06] that i've got to be i've got to get out
[1:50:09] i've got to get out
[1:50:10] because i know that my name is
[1:50:13] identified
[1:50:14] when you look at the lineage of jesus
[1:50:16] christ it's fair as
[1:50:18] his name first before zero because he
[1:50:22] was the one
[1:50:23] that the birthright was identified to
[1:50:27] something was pushing him forward
[1:50:31] what made you in this christmas season
[1:50:34] love him
[1:50:35] like you never loved him before
[1:50:37] something was pressing you forward
[1:50:39] what made you dedicate your life again
[1:50:42] something was pressing you forward
[1:50:45] what would make you say
[1:50:49] i'm not going to go back and do that no
[1:50:50] more
[1:50:52] i'm not gonna i'm not gonna look at that
[1:50:54] thing no more i'm not gonna walk that
[1:50:56] way no more
[1:50:58] i'm not gonna pick up that bottle no
[1:51:00] more i'm not gonna i'm not gonna
[1:51:02] communicate with those things no more
[1:51:04] i'm not going to let filthy
[1:51:05] communication come out of my mouth no
[1:51:07] more
[1:51:08] i'm not going to turn on that app no
[1:51:10] more i'm not going to turn that game on
[1:51:12] no more
[1:51:14] you follow what i'm saying what would
[1:51:16] make you
[1:51:17] make such a drastic change it's
[1:51:20] something
[1:51:21] pushing you forward
[1:51:25] and paul said all these things
[1:51:28] all the things i've learned in life
[1:51:31] are counted as done that i might win
[1:51:35] christ that is worth fighting for
[1:51:38] is worth living for
[1:51:44] let's stand this evening
[1:51:49] what would cause you to continue to
[1:51:52] anticipate is coming
[1:52:00] something's driving you something's
[1:52:03] pulling you
[1:52:07] the press towards the mark of the high
[1:52:09] calling
[1:52:14] we've had a witness
[1:52:17] that's amongst us the witness of the
[1:52:20] holy ghost
[1:52:22] that's brought miracles to pass
[1:52:30] people with sutton views for years
[1:52:33] receive the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:52:36] this year
[1:52:39] in a year of utter chaos in the midst of
[1:52:42] a pandemic
[1:52:44] this message is stronger than it's ever
[1:52:46] been before
[1:52:48] it's more vindicated than it's ever been
[1:52:50] before it's more translated than it's
[1:52:52] ever been before
[1:52:54] it's more believed in than it's ever
[1:52:56] been before
[1:52:58] and the people of god are moving forward
[1:53:01] with the power
[1:53:02] that is not their own but it's him
[1:53:10] god is with us
[1:53:14] i carry in my pocket tonight a knife
[1:53:18] that i got as a christmas gift
[1:53:21] has an inscription that god is with us
[1:53:26] i'm gonna carry it every time i preach
[1:53:30] and anytime the enemy stands up
[1:53:33] i have to i'll remind him that god is
[1:53:37] with us you can read between the lines
[1:53:41] but i'm not just carrying this just as a
[1:53:44] reminder that god is with us
[1:53:46] i know that god is with us but i'm
[1:53:48] carrying this for a very special purpose
[1:53:51] someone needs healing and i'm moving
[1:53:54] forward
[1:53:54] right into that healing every time i
[1:53:57] preach
[1:53:58] i'm preaching with this for healing
[1:54:01] every time david had a sling i got a
[1:54:03] knife
[1:54:06] but i got more than a knife i got an
[1:54:09] open book
[1:54:11] that says all things that the father has
[1:54:13] has given to me
[1:54:16] israel had a promised land that was
[1:54:17] sitting in front of them
[1:54:19] but it was never theirs until they
[1:54:21] stepped into it
[1:54:22] and moved forward to it
[1:54:26] let me say something daring just now
[1:54:28] maybe maybe not daring but
[1:54:33] but before there can be a baby come
[1:54:36] forth from a womb
[1:54:37] there's got to be somebody that believes
[1:54:40] and mary was
[1:54:42] that person mary was willing to stand
[1:54:45] against
[1:54:46] all the odds that was stacked up against
[1:54:48] her
[1:54:49] as she believed it let me say
[1:54:53] there's two miracles that are sitting in
[1:54:55] this place that are going to transpire
[1:54:57] and we're going to move forward into
[1:54:58] those things
[1:55:01] ron spencer's complete healing and anna
[1:55:04] thomas and jeffrey thomas's baby walking
[1:55:06] down that aisle
[1:55:07] and we cannot stay where we were in
[1:55:10] 2020.
[1:55:13] we have to move forward to a miracle
[1:55:16] we have to believe like never before we
[1:55:19] have to pray like never before
[1:55:21] we have to act like never before
[1:55:26] those things are in the natural but
[1:55:29] there are things that are hanging in the
[1:55:31] spiritual that are hanging over top of
[1:55:33] your life
[1:55:33] that you'll never get unless you believe
[1:55:37] unless you press pass in faith and say
[1:55:40] hey
[1:55:41] i can't see it but i believe it
[1:55:44] i don't know when it's gonna happen but
[1:55:46] i know it's gonna happen
[1:55:48] i can't understand what's transpiring
[1:55:51] but i know
[1:55:52] that it's transpiring i'm just
[1:55:55] crazy enough to believe to move forward
[1:55:58] into
[1:55:58] faith
[1:56:02] paul said nothing's going to separate me
[1:56:05] from the love of god nothing's going to
[1:56:07] separate me from this goal
[1:56:10] i'm going to press toward i'm going to
[1:56:12] move forward into it
[1:56:16] paul he could hear them sharpening the
[1:56:18] blade and he was still preaching
[1:56:22] we can hear as the devil is swearing
[1:56:25] out as he's swearing out his death
[1:56:27] threats we can hear him
[1:56:29] but we're just going to take god at his
[1:56:32] word
[1:56:33] and we're going to move forward into it
[1:56:37] let our knives be sharper
[1:56:40] than his tongue
[1:56:48] pressing on i'm gonna keep pressing on
[1:56:54] on and on and on i'm gonna keep pressing
