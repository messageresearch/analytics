[26:57] just come lead us through the throne of
[26:59] grace
[27:00] [Music]
[27:06] let's just Bauer heads
[27:09] Lord Jesus we are so thankful that we
[27:11] can just come and be in your presence
[27:12] tonight Lord we know the burdens that
[27:15] that we have all faced we know the
[27:18] trials and temptations that we're all
[27:19] faced throughout the week whether it was
[27:21] sicknesses or mind battles that Satan
[27:24] came to us but
[27:25] Lord Jesus you are worthy and you are
[27:28] worthy to come and you came and you were
[27:30] born in a from a womb that was created
[27:33] created by God and Lord Jesus you came
[27:36] down at this time and and you came to
[27:39] save us from from our sins that we could
[27:41] not save ourselves
[27:43] the Lord Jesus says As we walk our walk
[27:46] we we may stumble we may we may miss
[27:48] that but you were always there to pick
[27:50] us up and Lord Jesus we just we just ask
[27:53] that you'll just come down and be with
[27:54] us tonight as each and every one of the
[27:56] prayer requests were were brought across
[27:58] the pulpit this afternoon I just ask
[28:01] that you will go and be there with each
[28:02] and every one of them we just I just
[28:04] think of these patients that that
[28:05] they're battling cancer and they go to
[28:07] their doctor's appointments and they
[28:09] follow the checkups and they follow the
[28:11] procedures and they're following each
[28:13] and every step that that man has been
[28:15] able to do and we're so thankful for
[28:16] those steps but Lord Jesus we are
[28:18] speaking to the the great High physician
[28:20] that can come down and wipe every
[28:22] cancerous cell out of their body Lord
[28:23] and Lord Jesus we are just so thankful
[28:26] for everything you have done for us you
[28:28] we don't have one day that one day that
[28:30] is guaranteed for us we could be in full
[28:32] health and not be here tomorrow Lord and
[28:35] we can we can be facing death's door and
[28:37] and you give us another 10 15 years or
[28:40] he was completely and allow us to walk
[28:42] right into the rapture or Jesus and we
[28:44] don't know our steps but Lord Jesus I
[28:46] just ask that you will just come down
[28:48] and speak to the minister tonight speak
[28:50] through him that if anyone that would be
[28:51] here would would be bound by chains
[28:54] Bound by chains that may not may not
[28:55] even know what's going on during the
[28:57] ball and chain where they can walk so
[28:58] far and then Satan pulls them right back
[29:00] into the Trap that he has set for them I
[29:03] just ask that you would just lose those
[29:04] chains Lord Jesus
[29:06] I think about that the testimony that
[29:08] our pastor has said when he was up in
[29:09] Alaska and the his his preaching would
[29:12] go across the bullhorn and there would
[29:13] be a man that was AWOL from the AWOL
[29:16] from the Army up there but Lord Jesus
[29:18] you knew exactly where he was at and you
[29:19] brought him right back to you because
[29:21] Lord Jesus there is when you are a seed
[29:23] it doesn't matter where you are you may
[29:25] be walking the streets of streets of New
[29:27] York doing the things that that you may
[29:29] be doing and thinking that you've got
[29:31] your own path but Lord Jesus you know
[29:33] exactly where the seed and the time when
[29:35] that seed is supposed to sprout forth
[29:37] and Lord Jesus we just ask that you will
[29:39] just come forward and water each seed
[29:41] break the chains tonight Lord Jesus
[29:43] Break the chains of sickness of sin and
[29:46] allow us to walk in full health as we
[29:48] leave this building tonight in Jesus

[48:17] you tonight if you have your Bibles I'd
[48:19] like to just let you be turned in there
[48:20] while we make these comments John
[48:22] chapter 15 verse 5 and then to Isaiah
[48:25] chapter 28.
[48:27] and I'd like to I'd like to uh
[48:30] speak to you again one more time in the
[48:32] same vein of thought that we've been in
[48:34] for the past couple weekends and Lord
[48:36] willing will bring our Christmas message
[48:38] to you next weekend and
[48:40] and uh
[48:42] I'd like to I'd like to speak to you
[48:44] tonight on on resting in the most high
[48:47] resting in the most time as I said I'd
[48:49] like to stay in that same vein or that
[48:52] same channel of thought so that you can
[48:54] just prepare your mind to get there and
[48:55] I titled it just a little bit different
[48:57] because sometimes if you don't just
[48:59] don't change the title sometimes people
[49:01] think you're preaching the same old
[49:03] thing again so I change the title for
[49:04] you that might get a little bored of my
[49:06] title so but I'd like to speak to you
[49:08] tonight on resting resting in the most
[49:10] high and I appreciate that song Sister
[49:13] Sister Julia you just tapped right into
[49:15] the into the channel there and and so we
[49:19] just want to look at the look at the
[49:22] word here and look into the Lord
[49:24] I'd like to read first here from John
[49:27] chapter 15 and verse 5.
[49:35] Jesus said I am the Vine
[49:37] and ye are the branches and he that
[49:40] abideth in me and I in him the same
[49:43] bringeth forth much fruit
[49:45] for without me you can do nothing I say
[49:48] that together for without me you can do
[49:50] nothing
[49:51] if a man abide not in me he is cast
[49:55] forth as a branch and is withered and
[49:57] Men gather them and cast them into the
[49:59] fire and they are burned if you abide in
[50:02] me and my words abide in you you shall
[50:05] ask what you will and it shall be done
[50:08] unto you Isaiah chapter 28 and verse 10.
[50:17] that word that word abide there in the
[50:20] Book of John chapter 15 it means to stay
[50:23] it means to rest
[50:25] and Jesus said if you abide in me
[50:27] if you stay in me if you rest in me and
[50:30] my words rest in you
[50:33] you shall ask what you will and it shall
[50:35] be done unto you
[50:38] it's easy
[50:40] it's easy to get flustered
[50:42] it's easy to get worried
[50:45] but it's a wonderful thing to rest
[50:47] Isaiah chapter 28 and verse 10. for
[50:51] precept must be upon precept
[50:53] precept upon precept line upon line line
[50:56] upon line and hear a little and they're
[50:58] a little for with stammering lips and an
[51:00] unknown and another tongue will he speak
[51:03] to this people to whom he said this is
[51:06] the rest wherewith ye may be may cause
[51:10] the weary to rest and this is the
[51:13] refreshing yet they would not hear may
[51:16] God bless his word he may be seated in
[51:18] the presence of the Lord as we said we'd
[51:20] like to speak to you this evening just
[51:21] for a moment in time on on resting
[51:24] resting in the most high God in Isaiah
[51:27] 28 and 12 it says that this is the rest
[51:31] wherewith you may cause the weary to
[51:34] rest and this is the refreshing yet they
[51:37] would not hear we we just look into we
[51:41] look into the Ephesian Church age just
[51:43] for a moment to to gather some things
[51:45] but we recognize that when that when God
[51:48] is speaking to the the church at Ephesus
[51:51] that there John is writing and having
[51:53] these Visions on the Isle of Patmos that
[51:56] there John begins to be caught up into
[51:59] the spirit and be caught up into the
[52:01] Lord's day we recognize that John was
[52:03] able to reach all the way over all the
[52:05] way over into the Ephesian Church age
[52:07] all the way over into the laodicean
[52:09] church age was Able by the way of a
[52:11] vision was able to see the things that
[52:13] we are going through but recognize what
[52:15] the Bible says here in Revelations 2 and
[52:18] 1 that these things saith he that
[52:20] holdeth the Seven Stars in his right
[52:22] hand who walketh in the midst of the
[52:25] seven golden candlesticks brother
[52:27] Brandon said now where two or three are
[52:29] gathered together in his name there he
[52:31] is in the midst and not only in their
[52:34] midst as an as a complacent onlooker or
[52:37] as a recording Angel but there he stands
[52:40] expressing exactly what he is the life
[52:43] and sustainer and Giver of all good
[52:45] gifts to the church Hallelujah he said
[52:47] who walketh in the midst of the seven
[52:49] golden candlesticks how meaningful are
[52:52] those words when viewed in the light of
[52:55] the scripture which describes him as
[52:57] Christ who is our life for Christ indeed
[53:01] is the life of the church she has no
[53:04] other life without him she is simply a
[53:07] religious Society a club or a
[53:09] meaningless Gathering of people as a
[53:12] corpse Bejeweled and dressed is still a
[53:14] corpse so the church no matter what her
[53:17] programs and her gracious efforts might
[53:19] achieve without Christ she is a corpse
[53:22] also but with him in her midst with him
[53:25] motivating her she becomes for the
[53:28] wonderment of all his body the fullness
[53:30] of him that filleth all and all so we
[53:33] recognize that all the way that God is
[53:36] God no matter where he's at that God was
[53:39] showing himself in the midst of the
[53:41] Ephesian Church age that he was Hebrews
[53:44] 13 and 8 and he comes all the way down
[53:46] into the laodicean church age the last
[53:49] Church age where God would show himself
[53:51] and he shows himself as faithful and he
[53:54] shows himself as the amen that God has
[53:57] the finality to be able to say what he
[53:59] wants to and say what he will when he
[54:02] wants to and how he wants to and all the
[54:04] way from the Ephesian Church age all the
[54:06] way to the laodicean church age he is
[54:09] proving that he is the same yesterday
[54:11] today and forever and you see he is the
[54:15] church's life he is the bride's life he
[54:18] is her achievements he is her motivation
[54:20] and we recognize that this body this
[54:23] broad body that that God has presented
[54:25] in this last day to stand up and to be a
[54:28] token to the entire world that this
[54:30] bride's body is not a Bejeweled corpse
[54:33] that's just set up in a corner you know
[54:35] it's a hard thing to carry around a dead
[54:37] body sometimes and it's got no life in
[54:40] it if you ever tried to carry somebody
[54:42] that's passed out or tried to get them
[54:44] tried to get them back up there's no
[54:46] life in them they've completely went out
[54:47] and can you imagine carrying around a
[54:49] dead man and packing him around could
[54:52] you imagine God packing around a dead
[54:54] wife everywhere he went and said this is
[54:57] the wife that I've chosen to live out
[54:59] and finally live out the finality of the
[55:01] message of this hour but this broad body
[55:04] is not that of a Bejeweled corpse that
[55:08] has to be propped up that has to be set
[55:10] over in the corner and says she's still
[55:12] got life in her she doesn't have to be
[55:14] propped up by works she don't have to be
[55:16] profitable by intellect she don't have
[55:18] to be propped up by by formalities but
[55:20] the body that the body that is living in
[55:23] this hour has the same life has the same
[55:26] token has the same manifestation has the
[55:29] same works that her Lord Jesus Christ
[55:31] had and you notice that there is a
[55:33] Harmony that is in between her and the
[55:36] bridegroom it is him that is in the
[55:38] midst of her that is doing the works
[55:40] it's not the body it's not it's not
[55:42] necessarily the woman but it's the life
[55:45] that is living being pushed out of her
[55:47] that is making her expression of what
[55:50] Christ was then two thousand years ago
[55:52] if you wanna if you want to say well I
[55:55] would love to sing Jesus 2000 years ago
[55:57] walk on the shores of Galilee I would
[55:59] have loved to seen him walking walk over
[56:01] and heal the Widow of Maine's son I
[56:04] would have loved to been there when he
[56:05] healed the leper I'll say if you wanted
[56:07] to see it then you can see it right now
[56:09] because if he's still the same in his
[56:11] body he's got to do the same actions got
[56:14] to have the same power half because I
[56:16] got to have the same life and if you
[56:18] want to see Jesus today we ain't going
[56:20] to look for him in a book somewhere
[56:22] we're not going to look for him in some
[56:23] picture but we're going to look for him
[56:25] in the bride's body and I brother
[56:28] Brandon said I challenge you to believe
[56:29] that the son of man is revealed in the
[56:32] bride's body again
[56:33] now notice it notice to think that right
[56:36] here in the worst of all the ages that
[56:40] the most high is operating at full
[56:42] capacity
[56:43] to think that there is nothing that is
[56:45] holding him back in operating in his
[56:47] body to think that that he's got a wife
[56:50] that is fully submitted unto him that is
[56:52] willing to willing to let loose of
[56:55] everything that she that she knows and
[56:58] everything that she's built up or maybe
[57:00] maybe she's gathered knowledge of of
[57:02] religion throughout the years but
[57:04] because of a new birth she was willing
[57:06] to let go of all of the formalities of
[57:09] all the ideas of what she thought about
[57:11] who the Christ was but when she came and
[57:14] was birthed under this anointing she
[57:17] come and gave up everything that she was
[57:19] and to think that right here in the
[57:21] worst of all the ages when it's so dark
[57:24] out there that it that it looks like
[57:26] hell's getting hotter than it ever has
[57:28] but right now God is operating in the
[57:31] body of Jesus Christ at full capacity
[57:33] she's not holding him back but I'll say
[57:36] this that God has got full Liberty in
[57:39] the bride's body tonight I'll say that
[57:41] God ain't scared to work through his
[57:42] body God ain't scared what she'll do God
[57:45] each teared how you act because he knows
[57:47] that you're fully submitted unto him
[57:50] and to think that right now that you're
[57:52] resting you're not resting in a man's
[57:54] word I'll say this even go a little bit
[57:56] further you're not resting in William
[57:58] branham's own marriage you're not
[58:00] resting in his in his own abilities but
[58:03] you're resting in the power of the Holy
[58:05] Ghost if it was just a man that brought
[58:07] this powerful message I say my goodness
[58:10] he could have died on the cross for us
[58:12] if it was just a man but it's not a
[58:14] man's doing it's the anointing of the
[58:16] Holy Ghost that is operating in a
[58:18] message Church
[58:21] foreign
[58:24] think that right now you can live
[58:27] you can live in perfect peace and rest
[58:31] rest in him completely rested
[58:35] it's an amazing thing when you can drift
[58:37] off and I'm not talking about drifting
[58:39] off right now I got something to say to
[58:40] you but when you can really rest at it
[58:43] when you you can really rest you ever
[58:45] got one of them crack job plumbers come
[58:47] in your house and said they could really
[58:49] do something and that you got more leaks
[58:51] after they come in I've not had any
[58:53] plumbers come in my house lately so I'm
[58:55] just I'm just telling you I'm just
[58:56] speaking to you on this but have you
[58:58] ever had somebody come in say they could
[58:59] really do the job and then after they
[59:01] come in and do the job you got more
[59:03] problems you got more problems than that
[59:05] than you had in the first place but you
[59:08] know it's amazing thing that when you
[59:09] can fully rely on a contractor to be
[59:12] able to come in and do the job that he
[59:14] said that he's able to do and sit back
[59:16] you can you can go eat your meatloaf and
[59:18] you can go have your mashed potatoes
[59:20] while he's over there fixing your
[59:21] problems and you're not worried about
[59:23] what the situation is going to be
[59:25] because you're fully resting that he's
[59:27] able to fulfill his job and I'll say
[59:29] this that God is fully able to put this
[59:32] body in the Rapture I think it's an
[59:34] amazing thing that we can sit here
[59:36] tonight and have complete rest tonight
[59:38] knowing that he's in control I don't
[59:40] have to make up how they're going to get
[59:42] in there I don't have to make up or get
[59:44] unsettled about what the what this one's
[59:46] doing or that one's doing I rest in the
[59:48] promises that he is faithful
[59:52] it's easy to get flustered it's easy to
[59:55] get frustrated especially at this old
[59:57] flesh to think that that the older that
[59:59] we get the more this flesh it flustrates
[1:00:02] us we get all hot and bothered because
[1:00:04] we we get our hot flashes and hot and
[1:00:06] bothered by by all the things that my
[1:00:08] wish I wish I could do that like I used
[1:00:11] to be able to do it you know you know
[1:00:13] I'd say everybody that's 80 years old
[1:00:14] here tonight wishes that they had the
[1:00:16] body of a 30 or a 40 year old person
[1:00:19] again so that they could get out there
[1:00:21] and do the work that they want to do
[1:00:23] even though their mind might be able to
[1:00:25] operate at a level where they can think
[1:00:27] that they can still do it you better not
[1:00:30] because you're going to end up getting
[1:00:31] hurt
[1:00:33] even myself I recognize that this fast
[1:00:36] this flesh is failing me that the owner
[1:00:39] that I get the more I wake up stiff the
[1:00:41] more I wake up and think my where did
[1:00:43] that backache come from it didn't hurt
[1:00:45] there yesterday but it just moved up a
[1:00:47] little bit higher but you see we become
[1:00:49] into a spot where we recognize that
[1:00:52] we've got to have a way out of here
[1:00:54] we've got a way we've got to get out of
[1:00:56] this old pest house that that keeps
[1:00:58] aching our body where we have sciatica
[1:01:00] pain where we have high blood pressure
[1:01:02] where we have all of these anxieties of
[1:01:04] life that are built up against us and it
[1:01:06] seems like you can't have peace no more
[1:01:09] it's an amazing thing to actually say
[1:01:11] that you have peace in your home in this
[1:01:13] Century that you're living in they
[1:01:15] actually have a life that that doesn't
[1:01:17] come that doesn't just dump all of our
[1:01:19] problems on you but have a wife that
[1:01:21] actually loves you and can create an
[1:01:23] atmosphere of peace is an amazing thing
[1:01:26] but to recognize that to live in a world
[1:01:29] of perfect peace is only for us to let
[1:01:31] people
[1:01:32] but do you realize that that brother
[1:01:34] Bynum would tell us that brother Burnham
[1:01:35] tell us he had said he said you're all
[1:01:38] the time unsettled he said you can't
[1:01:39] find peace or unsettled peace he said
[1:01:42] you don't have no peace he said it
[1:01:43] wasn't meant for you to have peace here
[1:01:46] he said if you did you'd get cut you'd
[1:01:49] get accustomed to the world he said but
[1:01:51] God don't want you getting customized to
[1:01:53] this world he wants you to rest in him
[1:01:56] come to him then you have peace I don't
[1:01:59] care what takes place he said if you
[1:02:00] said the Russians is fixing to pull the
[1:02:02] trigger at this minute they're sending
[1:02:05] an atomic bomb a real born-again
[1:02:06] Christian has Eternal peace in his heart
[1:02:09] nothing there's nothing that can harm
[1:02:11] him he said let the bullet fire he said
[1:02:14] why the smoke won't be scattered out
[1:02:16] across the street here until we'll be
[1:02:18] gone in the glory with Jesus standing
[1:02:20] there Immortal in his likeness never to
[1:02:23] be sick never to have a heartache never
[1:02:26] to have disappointment
[1:02:28] you see God doesn't want you getting
[1:02:30] into a spot where you get accustomed to
[1:02:33] this world he wants you to rest
[1:02:36] in him
[1:02:38] he don't want you resting in your
[1:02:39] ability
[1:02:41] Abraham never had the ability when he
[1:02:43] was 100 years old in his own flesh to be
[1:02:45] able to produce an Isaac but when he met
[1:02:48] Melchizedek then
[1:02:51] for 25 years it's been promised to him
[1:02:54] but when Melchizedek comes he's in
[1:02:57] complete rest
[1:03:00] how am I going to make for Rapture how
[1:03:03] am I going to get through the bride's in
[1:03:05] complete rest
[1:03:08] now notice the Bible tells us in Hebrews
[1:03:11] 2 and 8 that thou has put all things in
[1:03:15] subjection under his feet for in that he
[1:03:17] put all uh put all in subjection under
[1:03:21] him he left nothing that is not put
[1:03:23] under him but now we see not yet all
[1:03:26] things put under him but we see Jesus
[1:03:28] who was made a little lower than the
[1:03:31] angels for the suffering of death
[1:03:33] crowned with Glory and Honor but he my
[1:03:35] that he by the grace of God should taste
[1:03:38] death for every one and we see the world
[1:03:42] geographically he said we see signs we
[1:03:44] see earthquakes in diverse places
[1:03:47] nations against Nations he said we see
[1:03:49] all the things that's predicted we see
[1:03:51] fearful sights he said we see the skies
[1:03:54] man's Hearts feelings were fear flying
[1:03:57] saucers and so forth they that they
[1:03:59] can't explain it investigating judgments
[1:04:01] that's come upon the Earth he said we
[1:04:03] see the atomic bombs hanging Yonder
[1:04:05] everywhere in the great missiles can can
[1:04:08] carry total Destruction in an hour we
[1:04:11] see the gases hanging over above us
[1:04:13] there he said we that would rain fires
[1:04:16] down out of the heavens and destroy the
[1:04:18] Earth we see all that he said but we see
[1:04:21] Jesus who made the promise to see you've
[1:04:24] got to have you've got to have him on
[1:04:27] your mind
[1:04:28] it's easy to get flustered it's easy to
[1:04:31] get worried it's easy to get anxiety in
[1:04:33] the world that we're living here but we
[1:04:35] are not looking where the rest of the
[1:04:37] world is looking at we see Jesus but
[1:04:41] I'll tell you the problem with so many
[1:04:42] with so many people around me around
[1:04:45] tertanity and I won't just say the
[1:04:47] message but around churchanity as a
[1:04:49] whole that that there is a people that
[1:04:52] care more about their image than they
[1:04:54] care about the image of Christ there are
[1:04:56] preachers that care more about their
[1:04:58] their image as a preacher that they
[1:05:01] can't go here or they can't go there or
[1:05:03] they can't preach that truth or they'll
[1:05:05] lose their meal ticket
[1:05:07] they're more scared of losing their
[1:05:09] image instead of being an image of
[1:05:11] Christ you see there's a lot of people
[1:05:13] that care more about their image because
[1:05:16] they they don't they they're never going
[1:05:17] to let loose to worship Him in spirit
[1:05:20] and in truth because they think more
[1:05:22] about their image if I let myself loose
[1:05:24] really to how I really feel like I'm
[1:05:27] going to let myself loose Then I then
[1:05:29] I'll make to fool of myself that's
[1:05:31] exactly what God is wanting you to do he
[1:05:34] can't use any of you he's wanting
[1:05:38] he's wanting you to be an image of him
[1:05:42] let me say this if I was worried about
[1:05:44] my image there's no way I'd get up here
[1:05:47] I'd scream and I'd holler and I'd
[1:05:49] slobber all over this Pulpit if I was
[1:05:51] worried about my image but baby I didn't
[1:05:53] come too far down the road I could care
[1:05:55] about a hill of beans as much about your
[1:05:58] opinion on what you think about how I
[1:06:00] should and how I ain't acting I don't
[1:06:03] care what it comes it's the burden of
[1:06:06] the word
[1:06:07] that is bringing forth a manifestation
[1:06:10] if it destroys my image but it produces
[1:06:13] the image of Christ I don't care let it
[1:06:16] produce it
[1:06:18] [Applause]
[1:06:25] we got too many people that even sit
[1:06:27] around the ranks of the message and say
[1:06:28] well I don't want no part of that Holy
[1:06:30] Roller business I ain't I've been in
[1:06:33] this message the whole entire my whole
[1:06:35] entire life and I ain't seen a Holy
[1:06:37] Roller yet I've been in this message a
[1:06:39] long time and I've never seen the Holy
[1:06:41] Ghost act up one time yet but a lot of
[1:06:44] times people are afraid to lose their
[1:06:46] image as a message believer and think
[1:06:49] we're just back in the days of
[1:06:51] traditions no more let me say this if
[1:06:53] you're afraid to shout if you're afraid
[1:06:56] to dance if you're afraid to amen if
[1:06:59] you're afraid to pray you are too afraid
[1:07:03] [Applause]
[1:07:06] I I hear a prophet saying I don't care
[1:07:08] if I got to speak in tongues I don't
[1:07:10] care about it I got crow in tones
[1:07:12] whatever I gotta do let me do according
[1:07:16] to the word of the Lord
[1:07:21] then you've got people that
[1:07:24] that actually let themselves loose to
[1:07:26] the liberty of the Holy Ghost
[1:07:29] and they're worried about what other
[1:07:30] people said
[1:07:33] and because they're afraid well you know
[1:07:35] maybe this ain't the right time to shout
[1:07:37] let me tell you
[1:07:39] right now is the perfect time
[1:07:41] anytime's a perfect time
[1:07:44] [Applause]
[1:07:46] and you they're because there's certain
[1:07:48] fears
[1:07:49] I don't know why I'm here
[1:07:52] but let me say this if you are fully
[1:07:54] adopted as a son and daughter of God
[1:07:57] filled with the Holy Ghost have the mind
[1:07:59] of almighty God you can never act out of
[1:08:02] the spirit
[1:08:03] [Applause]
[1:08:04] you will always be in the spirit if the
[1:08:07] spirit of the most high is dwelling in
[1:08:09] the Church of the Living God
[1:08:12] tour of me to Psalms 91 that was
[1:08:16] completely free for you
[1:08:18] back to the message
[1:08:21] notice
[1:08:22] notice what's Psalms 91 we're very
[1:08:25] familiar with it
[1:08:26] but notice notice that the targum
[1:08:29] Intimates that that this dialogue that
[1:08:33] is set forth here in Psalms 91 that it
[1:08:36] is a dialogue between David and Solomon
[1:08:39] and David and Jehovah
[1:08:42] and so we we see here that that that
[1:08:45] that David he is reporting to Solomon in
[1:08:49] Psalms 91 that he that dwelleth in the
[1:08:52] secret place of the most high shall
[1:08:55] abide under the shadow of the almighty
[1:08:57] and Solomon says back to David that I
[1:09:01] will save the Lord that he is my refuge
[1:09:03] and my Fortress my God in him will I
[1:09:07] trust and David goes and goes on and
[1:09:10] says from all the way from verse 3 to
[1:09:13] down to verse 13 surely he shall deliver
[1:09:16] thee From The Snare of the Fowler and
[1:09:18] from the noise and pestilence he shall
[1:09:21] cover thee with his feathers and under
[1:09:22] his wings shalt thou trust his truth
[1:09:25] shall be thy shield and buckler Thou
[1:09:27] shalt not be afraid for the terror by
[1:09:29] night nor for the error that flies by
[1:09:31] day nor for the pestilence that walketh
[1:09:34] in darkness nor for the destruction that
[1:09:36] wasted that Noonday A thousand shall
[1:09:39] fall at thy side and ten thousand at
[1:09:41] thou right hand but it shall not come
[1:09:44] nothing
[1:09:45] notice this is David talking to talking
[1:09:48] to Solomon he's telling him all of these
[1:09:50] things none of this is going to come
[1:09:52] nothing only with on Ice shall they
[1:09:54] behold and see the reward of the wicked
[1:09:57] because thou Hast made the Lord which is
[1:09:59] my refuge even the most high thy
[1:10:01] habitation there shall be there shall no
[1:10:04] evil befall thee Solomon neither so any
[1:10:06] plague come thigh thy dwelling for he
[1:10:09] shall give his angels charge over thee
[1:10:11] to keep thee in all thy ways and they
[1:10:14] shall bear thee up in their hands lest
[1:10:17] thou Dash thy foot against a stone thou
[1:10:19] shall tread upon the lion and the adder
[1:10:21] the Young Lion and the dragon shall thou
[1:10:24] trample under his feet
[1:10:26] this has been a conversation
[1:10:28] between David and his son Solomon
[1:10:32] but now Jehovah begins to talk what is
[1:10:35] Jehovah about to do he is confirming
[1:10:38] everything that David has said to his
[1:10:40] son he said because this is Jehovah's
[1:10:43] words because he has set his love upon
[1:10:45] me therefore will I deliver him I will
[1:10:49] set him on high because he has known my
[1:10:51] name
[1:10:53] Hallelujah he shall call upon me and I
[1:10:57] will answer him I will be with him in
[1:10:59] trouble I will deliver him and honor him
[1:11:01] with long life will I satisfy him and
[1:11:05] show him my salvation
[1:11:07] Jehovah comes behind David's words and
[1:11:10] he backs up what he said and he confirms
[1:11:13] it to him
[1:11:15] and I am convinced and I am concerned
[1:11:18] and recognized that Jehovah is here to
[1:11:21] back up the message and we are like
[1:11:23] Aaron that walked into the holies of
[1:11:26] holies you're not going to have to worry
[1:11:28] you've been dressed right you've been
[1:11:30] dressed right you've been anointed right
[1:11:32] your Praise Is Right your Worship Is
[1:11:35] Right
[1:11:37] because by one Spirit we are all
[1:11:39] baptized into one body we didn't get
[1:11:42] into this bright Body by handshake by
[1:11:45] some man's idea but what we thought it
[1:11:47] was or what somebody else thought it was
[1:11:49] we got in this message because the
[1:11:52] spirit's all fit for us to get here
[1:11:56] foreign
[1:12:00] a covenant with Abraham and you're you
[1:12:03] you just you just bear with me as I as I
[1:12:06] as I lay these things just for a moment
[1:12:08] that God had swore a covenant a covenant
[1:12:10] with Abraham that thy seed would possess
[1:12:13] the Gate of its enemies that I'm going
[1:12:15] to give you a land that that is going to
[1:12:18] be flowing with milk and honey and you
[1:12:20] notice that he give him he gave him the
[1:12:22] promise of the promised lamb and I want
[1:12:25] you to notice that that when God gave
[1:12:27] that promise to Abraham
[1:12:29] in the minds of human fathers and human
[1:12:32] mothers I'd say Joshua wasn't even in
[1:12:34] the picture because if you look at the
[1:12:36] time frame that is laying there between
[1:12:39] between when God speaks to Abraham until
[1:12:42] Joshua goes in it's over 660 years
[1:12:46] before before Joshua Emerson or enter
[1:12:49] into the promised land there's a whole
[1:12:51] lot of time that is laying there but God
[1:12:53] is not bound by time
[1:12:55] because God sees what your future is and
[1:12:59] I'll say it doesn't matter what you're
[1:13:00] going through God already sees what your
[1:13:03] future is but I want you to know that
[1:13:05] every time that God begins to speak to
[1:13:07] his children that Satan sends his little
[1:13:09] demons up there to listen in on what God
[1:13:12] has had because the only way because
[1:13:14] Satan is not omniscient he's not all
[1:13:17] knowing so he has to send out his ranks
[1:13:20] to listen to what God is going to say so
[1:13:22] that he can form a plan so he hears
[1:13:25] Abraham and God having a conversation
[1:13:27] that I'm going to give you this land and
[1:13:30] I'm going to I will tell you where it's
[1:13:31] going to be I'll tell you where your
[1:13:33] land's going to be at Abraham you look
[1:13:35] North you look South you look West and
[1:13:37] you look East and I'll tell you that's
[1:13:40] going to be your land so what did Satan
[1:13:42] do he sent out his little army
[1:13:44] everywhere
[1:13:45] because he knew that he couldn't stop
[1:13:47] him on his own so he sent out his arm
[1:13:49] and said well I guess I'll get them from
[1:13:51] all sides if they come in the East I'll
[1:13:53] be over there if they go over the West
[1:13:55] I'll be over there you see Satan has
[1:13:57] been working against the Church of the
[1:13:59] Living God for a long time
[1:14:02] but I want you to know that every time
[1:14:04] that Satan knows that you're about to
[1:14:06] possess new land whether it be healing
[1:14:09] whether it be blessings whether it be
[1:14:11] Deliverance you can call out what you
[1:14:13] have need of if you're getting ready to
[1:14:15] possess new land Satan knows and he will
[1:14:18] move in and he will occupy your
[1:14:21] blessings to keep you off of the land
[1:14:27] you trust me
[1:14:29] I'm giving you a prophet's quote and
[1:14:31] paraphrasing it but let me read it to
[1:14:32] you because some legalistic person on
[1:14:34] the internet think I'll just make this
[1:14:35] up he said but God proved his loyalty to
[1:14:38] his promise by Abraham then he told him
[1:14:40] his seed that he'd sojourn in a Strange
[1:14:43] Land and they did but he said he would
[1:14:45] bring them out and give them that land
[1:14:47] wherein he dwelt he said notice what
[1:14:49] brother random said he said now since
[1:14:51] that time
[1:14:53] since the time that Abraham made a
[1:14:55] covenant with him he said since that
[1:14:57] time the Emirates of Paris Heights the
[1:15:00] heavy assats the jebusites and all the
[1:15:02] Gentile Heathen Nations had taken over
[1:15:05] this beautiful paradise in there and he
[1:15:07] had occupied in that land yet God had
[1:15:10] promised it
[1:15:12] oh
[1:15:14] you think about this
[1:15:16] is 660 to 685 years
[1:15:21] that Satan's been at work going over in
[1:15:23] that land
[1:15:24] and tearing about and tearing apart a
[1:15:27] perfect Paradise
[1:15:30] he sent out amarites he sent out hivites
[1:15:34] he sent out dirty websites to go over
[1:15:36] there and destroy the land before you
[1:15:38] ever got there I'll say this that Satan
[1:15:41] has been working on your mind battle
[1:15:43] that you have this week way before you
[1:15:45] ever got here
[1:15:47] Satan has been planning out how to keep
[1:15:50] you out of the land but the Bible tells
[1:15:52] us in Deuteronomy 2 and 31 behold I have
[1:15:55] begun to give you the land you begin to
[1:15:57] possess the land you see there are going
[1:15:59] to be obstacles that stand in your way
[1:16:01] but move towards your promise move in
[1:16:04] not fear in any opposition I tell you
[1:16:07] what this was he was an ending of Israel
[1:16:10] wandering and it was a beginning of them
[1:16:13] beginning to possess the land
[1:16:15] they had circled the mountain long
[1:16:17] enough they'd wondered about mountains
[1:16:19] long enough but God is saying it's your
[1:16:21] time to possess it you've wondered about
[1:16:24] it all your life but now it's time to
[1:16:26] possess it
[1:16:28] I'll say this that as soon as a message
[1:16:30] hit the earth the bride's body begin to
[1:16:33] not long and no longer Wonder but she
[1:16:35] began to possess every promise that was
[1:16:37] laid there for her which since 1963 when
[1:16:41] the seals was ripped off the book there
[1:16:43] is a lamb's wife that is standing here
[1:16:46] that's fully adopted has an open book in
[1:16:49] her hand she's not wondering if the
[1:16:51] message is right she knows it's right
[1:16:53] she's not guessing about it she's not
[1:16:55] wondering about it she knows that the
[1:16:57] message will take her into a promised
[1:17:00] land and change her body
[1:17:04] all right
[1:17:07] I'll tell you the trouble of it is
[1:17:10] Satan knows that you're right
[1:17:13] it's amazing that Satan knows that
[1:17:15] you're right and he makes you question
[1:17:17] whether you're right or not
[1:17:19] he knows that if you got in this
[1:17:21] building tonight that you would gain
[1:17:22] strength for two to three months from
[1:17:24] now you would gain strength from
[1:17:26] eternity so he tried everything to keep
[1:17:29] you from getting into this service
[1:17:30] tonight but behold I've begun to give
[1:17:33] you the land begin to possess the land
[1:17:35] I've already give you the Holy Ghost
[1:17:37] possess the Holy Ghost I've already
[1:17:39] given you the healing possess your
[1:17:41] healing I've already give you a baby
[1:17:43] talking possession I've already give you
[1:17:46] a baby I've already give you a miracle
[1:17:48] possess your Miracle it's a time that we
[1:17:51] enter in to what God has already built
[1:17:54] for us
[1:17:55] I ain't shook up about it I'm resting in
[1:17:58] it
[1:17:58] [Applause]
[1:18:07] let's rest in the theory
[1:18:09] this rest ain't a Creed this rest ain't
[1:18:12] an idea but God is our rest
[1:18:15] just like when he began to speak to
[1:18:17] speak to Moses over there
[1:18:20] God knew that he was going to be the
[1:18:22] deliverer
[1:18:23] when it didn't look like it
[1:18:26] but notice what the words of Jehovah was
[1:18:29] to him in Exodus 23 and 20 that behold
[1:18:32] I'll send an angel before they to keep
[1:18:33] thee and bring you into a land that I
[1:18:35] prepared before you and he was telling
[1:18:37] Moses I'm going to be with you I'm going
[1:18:39] to go before you and he had signs
[1:18:42] pouring for a performed in his message
[1:18:44] in his ministry and Moses was fully
[1:18:47] resting in the one that he met up there
[1:18:49] in the burning bush you see it was a
[1:18:51] whole lot more than Fred than his mama
[1:18:53] telling him that the message was right
[1:18:55] but he had met the personal person of
[1:18:58] the message up there on that mountain
[1:19:01] and he knew that God was going to be
[1:19:03] with him he had troubles with Pharaoh he
[1:19:05] had trouble with a bunch of legalistic
[1:19:07] people down there in Egypt he had a
[1:19:09] bunch of backsliders down there but yet
[1:19:11] he had a promise over him that he was
[1:19:13] going to bring them out no matter what
[1:19:15] the critics say no matter what the
[1:19:16] skeptic said God said I'm going to be
[1:19:19] with you he wasn't worried about it he
[1:19:21] was resting in the promise
[1:19:24] he was resting in it and he told him I'm
[1:19:27] going to be with you I'm gonna go with
[1:19:29] you I'll be there you see and they knew
[1:19:32] they were on the road to the land of the
[1:19:35] rest and that God had given him a rest a
[1:19:38] place where they wouldn't have to be
[1:19:40] hand under task Masters over them they
[1:19:42] wouldn't have to be in a land where Past
[1:19:44] Masters to drive them and to make them
[1:19:47] do things but they were going to a land
[1:19:49] to rest
[1:19:55] it's amazing that God would bring
[1:19:58] a message to you unrest
[1:20:01] in the busiest time of the year
[1:20:05] I got to go here I gotta go there I got
[1:20:07] to pick this up gotta pick that up
[1:20:08] cookies change tomorrow yes okay I'll
[1:20:10] eat them for two more weeks put them in
[1:20:12] the freezer eat them for two more months
[1:20:13] not me
[1:20:16] I gotta go buy this person a person
[1:20:17] because I know they're gonna buy me a
[1:20:18] present and you are so worked up
[1:20:24] how about Christmas was about Christ
[1:20:34] foreign
[1:20:41] he said those little kitties are looking
[1:20:43] for that present he said so you remember
[1:20:45] them little kitties and all of us still
[1:20:47] little kitties too ain't we
[1:20:53] but you see the pillar fire was leading
[1:20:55] them to the land of the rest and all of
[1:20:59] Israel no matter if it was Joshua all
[1:21:01] the way down to the to the Tribe of
[1:21:03] Benjamin they were all under the
[1:21:06] anointing of that Angelic Covenant that
[1:21:08] God had already spoke to them up there
[1:21:10] on that mountain and they were going to
[1:21:12] go in it didn't matter what tribe you
[1:21:15] was in it didn't matter where you came
[1:21:16] from if God saw you in that land
[1:21:20] it doesn't matter if you're a Spencer it
[1:21:22] don't matter if you're afraid sir it
[1:21:24] don't matter if you're a born of on a
[1:21:25] Reagan or a Pruitt if God saw you going
[1:21:27] in there God is going to have a people
[1:21:30] possess the land I'm sick and tired of
[1:21:33] the devil whispering in people's ear
[1:21:34] until I wasn't born in the right family
[1:21:36] yes you were if you were born again you
[1:21:40] are born into the family of the most
[1:21:42] high God you ain't going in because your
[1:21:44] last name you're going in because of him
[1:21:47] [Music]
[1:21:48] and I'm resting on that
[1:21:51] I'm resting on that I'm not resting in
[1:21:55] my own marriage I'm not resting in
[1:21:57] myself I'm resting on him
[1:21:59] [Applause]
[1:22:09] What a Sad thing it is
[1:22:13] they've got to give them this promise
[1:22:16] and because they begin to murmur and
[1:22:19] they begin to complain
[1:22:21] what was it it was their unbelief
[1:22:23] and the Bible said in the book of
[1:22:25] Hebrews I believe it's 3 and 17 that the
[1:22:27] Bible said that their their carcasses
[1:22:29] was found out there in the wilderness
[1:22:31] and they couldn't enter into the land of
[1:22:32] the rest because of their unbelief and
[1:22:35] to think that there they were all that
[1:22:37] time they were under the greatest
[1:22:38] leadership that the world had ever seen
[1:22:40] until that time and they couldn't
[1:22:42] completely go in because of their
[1:22:44] unbelief but God was going to raise up a
[1:22:47] new generation by the name of Joshua
[1:22:50] under a Joshua commission that was fully
[1:22:52] in his commission to walk in there and
[1:22:55] possess everything that stood in front
[1:22:57] of him and I'll say Joshua arrested even
[1:23:00] after Moses died because the angel of
[1:23:02] the Lord told him said as I was with
[1:23:04] Moses so I will be with you some people
[1:23:07] are always worried about well if William
[1:23:09] Brandon was here that's the same Angel
[1:23:11] what's with William Branham that same
[1:23:13] Angel is in this building right now
[1:23:17] there won't be no habit keep you from it
[1:23:19] there won't be no problem keep you from
[1:23:21] it the power of the angel
[1:23:29] a lot of people you got a lot of people
[1:23:32] Moses they disbelieving but don't you
[1:23:34] worry God's going to raise up somebody
[1:23:37] there's a whole lot of people in the
[1:23:39] yeah
[1:23:40] there's a whole lot of people that are
[1:23:42] refusing to worship God there's a whole
[1:23:45] lot of people that are refusing to live
[1:23:47] a message but God is going to raise up a
[1:23:49] Joshua and he's going to raise up a
[1:23:51] Caleb God ain't worried about the other
[1:23:52] 10 spies God's got a Joshua
[1:23:56] what William Branham tell us that we are
[1:23:59] under a Joshua commission that Ephesians
[1:24:01] parallels Joshua and it perfectly
[1:24:04] parallels that this is your inheritance
[1:24:07] that's why William Branham come to us
[1:24:10] and preached us on the Feast of the
[1:24:11] trumpets he laid out the borders for the
[1:24:14] bride body
[1:24:15] he told us this is our inheritance
[1:24:20] he went down in there and he broke in in
[1:24:23] 1964 and he broke into the river
[1:24:26] Euphrates and he's seen all those demons
[1:24:28] raising up out of there and they were
[1:24:30] trying to keep the Church of the Living
[1:24:31] God out of their Liberties he said that
[1:24:34] whole that's coming to people that are
[1:24:35] going to accept their Liberty and I'll
[1:24:37] say that they
[1:24:40] because of the message and because the
[1:24:43] borders have been set
[1:24:46] ain't no Kingdom Builders around here no
[1:24:48] more we only got one Kingdom to strive
[1:24:50] for and that's the power of the most
[1:24:53] high God
[1:24:58] I'm preaching to you without without
[1:25:00] saying a whole lot of things and I hope
[1:25:02] you catching my drift but Joshua wasn't
[1:25:04] going to let anybody stand in between
[1:25:06] him and the Promised Land
[1:25:09] I'll say that there's going to be some
[1:25:11] young boys and some young girls that
[1:25:13] rise up and won't let anybody stand
[1:25:15] between them and the Holy Ghost if God
[1:25:18] said it's for them they're going to rise
[1:25:20] up and rest that is for them if there's
[1:25:22] Mama's if there's somebody that's going
[1:25:24] to believe and mamas can raise up and
[1:25:26] say well my my child my child
[1:25:28] necessarily ain't got the baptism of the
[1:25:30] Holy Ghost but a prophet said to hold
[1:25:32] our token over her told her and hold
[1:25:34] hold our token over them and watch them
[1:25:37] be filled with the Holy Ghost I believe
[1:25:38] that there's going to be some Mamas and
[1:25:40] some daddies that held true held fast
[1:25:42] the profession of their faith and watch
[1:25:44] a prodigal come in the house of God I
[1:25:46] know you get a little shook up about me
[1:25:48] preaching about prodigals because
[1:25:49] they're going to come in and take your
[1:25:50] seat let me say if you won't worship God
[1:25:53] God will bring somebody in off the
[1:25:54] street gotta bring some prostitute
[1:25:57] that'll worship Him in spirit and in
[1:25:59] truth and appreciate the power of
[1:26:01] salvation
[1:26:03] come on
[1:26:06] lock the hinges open it wide make a new
[1:26:09] entrance because it's coming a church
[1:26:11] that's Rising above every Doctrine
[1:26:13] Rising above every Creed Rising above
[1:26:16] every idea
[1:26:17] I'll be going to give it to you you
[1:26:19] begin to possess it
[1:26:35] and Joshua comes to the thing that
[1:26:39] stands between him
[1:26:42] and his promise
[1:26:45] and it was death
[1:26:48] was standing between him
[1:26:50] and Rahab
[1:26:53] death was standing him between him and
[1:26:55] going fully in and giving Caleb his
[1:26:58] Mountain
[1:27:01] a little Old River
[1:27:05] it can be beautiful
[1:27:07] he can be perfect
[1:27:10] but at the time that God decided to lead
[1:27:12] his children across Jordan it was the
[1:27:16] worst time that there was
[1:27:21] but Joshua one Shook Up
[1:27:24] he watched the people gather around the
[1:27:26] message
[1:27:28] he seen them get under the Angelic
[1:27:30] Covenant
[1:27:31] he watched them grab the inspiration
[1:27:34] and they started to move forward
[1:27:39] but this is in my way brother Andrew I'm
[1:27:41] resting that everything's okay
[1:27:44] been diagnosed
[1:27:47] been promised certain things and things
[1:27:49] didn't happen but I'm resting
[1:27:53] I ain't seen a move in a long time
[1:27:56] I see my legs move and I ain't see my
[1:27:59] hands move I seem like I'm a little bit
[1:28:01] paralyzed
[1:28:03] but I'm resting in it
[1:28:09] and here Jericho stand between him
[1:28:13] and everything that he has need of
[1:28:16] foreign
[1:28:20] you realize what it looked to the on
[1:28:23] onlooker that God has messed up
[1:28:27] he brought them all the way down here to
[1:28:29] laodicea and they taped it out
[1:28:33] it's like it's like God barked the doors
[1:28:35] on them
[1:28:42] you see people
[1:28:44] when God Did It for William Branham but
[1:28:46] I ain't seen you produce one
[1:28:47] cancer-ridden patient yet
[1:28:50] and you get frustrated at it
[1:28:52] if God did it then
[1:28:55] God I know you're still God
[1:28:58] I know you're still able I know
[1:29:01] I'm like Gideon if God before us then
[1:29:03] where be all of his miracles
[1:29:06] and people get frustrated because they
[1:29:07] haven't seen
[1:29:09] the thing worked out the way they prayed
[1:29:11] it to work out
[1:29:13] don't you know God's got a bigger plan
[1:29:15] than you just getting rid of your little
[1:29:18] bitty trial
[1:29:20] do you trust him
[1:29:23] because if you trust him he'll use you
[1:29:25] like never before you're going to have
[1:29:28] to go through some stuff but are you
[1:29:30] resting
[1:29:31] [Applause]
[1:29:33] let me say this that to to the onlooker
[1:29:36] it looked
[1:29:38] it looked like Joshua was the worst
[1:29:41] leader that there was he looked like the
[1:29:44] worst General that there ever could be
[1:29:46] when he was leading them over there at
[1:29:49] the worst of times to go over that River
[1:29:51] when it was a time in a season when all
[1:29:55] of that one of the Bible said it was a
[1:29:56] worse at times when all that snow was
[1:29:58] mounting off of that mountain up there
[1:30:00] and rushing down that River and it was
[1:30:02] coming down through there but the Bible
[1:30:04] said that Joshua told them to sanctify
[1:30:08] themselves go read Joshua 3 don't do her
[1:30:10] right now but go sanctify yourself
[1:30:12] because tomorrow the Lord will do
[1:30:15] wondrous things amongst you do you know
[1:30:18] where you're living at you're living in
[1:30:20] the hour well William Branham saw that
[1:30:23] there would be a manifestation of a body
[1:30:26] living in complete dynamics of the Holy
[1:30:28] Ghost today not tomorrow but today
[1:30:32] prepare yourself for the wondrous acts
[1:30:34] of almighty God
[1:30:37] this bride ain't shook up and worried
[1:30:39] about when it's coming or how it's
[1:30:41] coming but she's trusting him
[1:30:49] God Commander Joshua you get the priest
[1:30:53] and you pack them and you get 12 men and
[1:30:56] you go out there and you get the priests
[1:30:58] that are to Bear the Ark of the Covenant
[1:31:00] the word of the Lord and place it upon
[1:31:03] their shoulders and you march out into
[1:31:05] that water and when the priests touched
[1:31:08] the water that the Lord will stand up
[1:31:11] the river upon heaps can you imagine
[1:31:14] looking at Niagara Falls and all of its
[1:31:16] power turned upside down
[1:31:20] you see how many gallons of water
[1:31:22] millions of gallons of water that
[1:31:24] Niagara Falls is dumping every single
[1:31:26] second
[1:31:27] and God Turns Upside down Niagara Falls
[1:31:31] over there on the Jordan River when
[1:31:33] priests step into their position and
[1:31:35] recognize that they are under a Joshua
[1:31:38] commission to step out into the waters
[1:31:45] let me read you this
[1:31:46] scripture
[1:31:50] Joshua 3 and 13 that it shall come to
[1:31:53] pass as soon as the souls of the feet of
[1:31:56] the priests that bear the Ark of the
[1:31:58] Lord the Lord of all the Earth shall
[1:32:01] rest in the waters of Jordan that the
[1:32:03] Waters of Jordan shall be cut off from
[1:32:06] the waters that come down from above and
[1:32:08] they shall stand up upon a heap when the
[1:32:10] Lord that is the Lord of all the Earth
[1:32:13] shall rest in the waters
[1:32:18] what do you got to fear about death
[1:32:21] what do you got to fear about Jordan
[1:32:23] when the Lord of all the Earth is
[1:32:25] resting upon death
[1:32:27] don't you realize what Jesus Christ did
[1:32:29] for you at Calvary if you have been
[1:32:31] fully born again as a son and daughter
[1:32:34] of God you don't even know death death
[1:32:37] can't even touch you death is simply a
[1:32:39] doorway but do you recognize that when
[1:32:42] Joshua commanded those priests to step
[1:32:45] in there that when the word of the Lord
[1:32:47] rested upon their troubles let the
[1:32:49] trouble begin to cease
[1:32:53] 660 years the devil's been trying he's
[1:32:57] been working and tearing about tearing
[1:32:59] apart your Paradise but you give Joshua
[1:33:02] seven days and he's going to get your
[1:33:03] Rahab out for 660 years Satan's been
[1:33:07] planning tactics against you but you
[1:33:09] give us seven years you give us seven
[1:33:11] days and let us shout on the seventh
[1:33:14] power you watch Rahab get out you can
[1:33:16] try to keep her in there you can try to
[1:33:18] enslave her with prostitution but you
[1:33:21] watch the Power of Joshua's message
[1:33:27] foreign
[1:33:29] I know that it's
[1:33:32] I know revelation's slipping out of an
[1:33:34] Unseen World and it's coming to you
[1:33:36] and you're grabbing hold of it
[1:33:40] but you've got to walk out
[1:33:44] rehab binded together
[1:33:48] all the material that she had in her
[1:33:51] house
[1:33:52] and you have the token to get out of
[1:33:54] Jericho
[1:33:56] okay
[1:33:58] you know there there are people that
[1:34:00] live
[1:34:01] in abusive situations not everybody's
[1:34:03] got perfect perfect homes
[1:34:07] not everybody has has perfect marriages
[1:34:11] a lot of times
[1:34:14] a lot of times that there are
[1:34:17] people that get
[1:34:19] kidnapped or become captive to an abuser
[1:34:22] or to an offender
[1:34:27] that before long if they've been with
[1:34:29] that abuser for so long that they begin
[1:34:31] to cope
[1:34:33] or they begin to cope with the captor
[1:34:35] and they develop what science says is
[1:34:38] called the Stockholm syndrome that they
[1:34:40] begin to cope with the person that has
[1:34:43] stole them and the person that has
[1:34:44] abused them all their days and because
[1:34:46] they maybe give them a little bit of
[1:34:48] food here or give them a little food
[1:34:50] there or take care of them they begin to
[1:34:52] develop the syndrome that they feel
[1:34:55] affection
[1:34:57] for the abuser
[1:34:58] and I'm afraid that too many times
[1:35:00] people get Stockholm syndrome with the
[1:35:03] Devil they get to a customer living this
[1:35:06] way for so long that they are afraid
[1:35:09] that if they step out of that out of the
[1:35:12] realm of that abuser that they'll they
[1:35:14] won't get picked up no more you find
[1:35:16] Sometimes women get in an abusive
[1:35:18] situation or an abusive relationship
[1:35:20] they're afraid that if they let if they
[1:35:23] let him go they'll never find anybody
[1:35:25] else and they live in an abusive
[1:35:27] situation when they don't have to
[1:35:33] and they live with a syndrome of well
[1:35:35] it's just got to be this way no it don't
[1:35:38] have to be that way you don't have to
[1:35:40] live with a man beating you and you
[1:35:42] don't have to live with a woman that's
[1:35:44] constantly trying to take a frying pan
[1:35:46] to your head but I'll tell you you ain't
[1:35:49] got to live with the devil telling you
[1:35:50] you're not good enough you don't have to
[1:35:52] live with a devil telling you'll never
[1:35:54] get out of this you'll never overcome
[1:35:56] but you can break the power of Satan and
[1:35:59] rest in the promises that the name of
[1:36:02] Jesus Christ is stronger than every
[1:36:04] death or it breaks every abusive
[1:36:06] situation it breaks every stronghold
[1:36:09] because our weapons are not carnal but
[1:36:11] they're mighty
[1:36:13] you're not just under anointing of Acts
[1:36:17] 2 but you're under the anointing of the
[1:36:19] mighty Angel and the mighty Angel is
[1:36:21] here to tell you roll back the tide on
[1:36:24] the devil each time that you cross over
[1:36:26] into the promised land and receive it
[1:36:39] depression this is your last day my
[1:36:41] Joshua is here anxiety this is your last
[1:36:44] day my Joshua is here
[1:36:48] there's gonna be somebody to rise up and
[1:36:51] say cancer this is your last day her
[1:36:53] problems this is the last day sugar
[1:36:55] diabetes this is the last day
[1:36:58] lay on us here you're about to lose your
[1:37:00] hold you ain't gonna abuse me no more
[1:37:02] it's time I just was here
[1:37:05] [Applause]
[1:37:12] Christ
[1:37:13] is identified in the word revealed in
[1:37:16] this hour
[1:37:17] you see Christ came and he identified
[1:37:20] himself with the word by manifesting the
[1:37:23] word of the hour and the bride is now
[1:37:26] manifesting the word of her hour and she
[1:37:29] is identified by his characteristics she
[1:37:31] does the same Works does the same
[1:37:33] actions she's got the same life you see
[1:37:36] when God calls Adam to a dog I deep
[1:37:40] sleep to fall upon Adam in Genesis
[1:37:41] chapter 2 that Adam that God brought out
[1:37:45] of Adam a part of Adam he pulled out of
[1:37:48] him under his rib he pulled out of it
[1:37:51] his heart pulled a part of himself out
[1:37:53] and he produced an eve what was she she
[1:37:56] was an extension of what Adam was Adam
[1:37:59] back there was creating life and moving
[1:38:02] life and sustaining life but when she
[1:38:06] came out of him she was simply an
[1:38:09] extension of what Adam was and the Bible
[1:38:12] said that Adam named her Eve because she
[1:38:16] came out of man he called her a woman
[1:38:19] because she come out of man he said
[1:38:22] she's now bone of my bone she is now
[1:38:24] Flesh of My Flesh and to think that
[1:38:27] there is again another people under the
[1:38:30] land that under their Messenger will
[1:38:33] become a final voice to the final age
[1:38:38] she's got the same actions the same
[1:38:40] power she's life of his life she's born
[1:38:43] of his bone she's word of his word she's
[1:38:45] manifestation she's Works she's
[1:38:47] demonstration
[1:38:53] he has never put more on you than you
[1:38:55] can handle
[1:38:57] he's given you the capacity to be able
[1:39:00] to walk into the land of the Holy Ghost
[1:39:02] going through every trouble that you've
[1:39:04] been through
[1:39:12] there's a lot of generals sitting all
[1:39:13] over this building
[1:39:17] men and women
[1:39:20] sitting all over this building
[1:39:24] laughs
[1:39:25] that had been through hell
[1:39:29] they lost every dime and that was given
[1:39:31] to their name
[1:39:32] but they stood faithful
[1:39:35] they lost loved ones to cancer they lost
[1:39:38] daughters they lost Sons
[1:39:41] still here
[1:39:46] because they were resting
[1:39:48] in him
[1:39:54] the rest is in a day
[1:39:56] the rest isn't a year the rest stand a
[1:39:59] Saturday and it ain't a Sunday but the
[1:40:00] rest is a person
[1:40:03] the rest ain't a Creed and the rest
[1:40:05] ain't an idea the rest is a person and
[1:40:08] the Bible said in Isaiah 28 that with a
[1:40:11] stammering ellipse and another tongue
[1:40:13] will I speak to them and this is the
[1:40:17] Sabbath this is the rest to cause the
[1:40:20] weary to rest
[1:40:23] go read in Isaiah 40 31 read what Jesus
[1:40:26] said unto you come unto me all you that
[1:40:29] are heavy laden and I will give you rest
[1:40:32] I will give you eternal life now what
[1:40:35] was that prophecy that Isaiah was
[1:40:38] talking about over in Isaiah 28 it was
[1:40:41] fulfilled 700 years later up there on
[1:40:43] the day of Pentecost when he was up
[1:40:45] there when Peter was up there and Mary
[1:40:48] the Mother of God was a player and they
[1:40:50] were up there and the power of the Holy
[1:40:52] Ghost come upon them
[1:40:54] they knew they knew that something was
[1:40:57] coming that would bring them rest in
[1:40:59] their spirit because Joel had prophesied
[1:41:01] it Isaiah had prophesied it and they
[1:41:04] accepted the experience of the rest when
[1:41:06] it came
[1:41:12] hallelujah hallelujah that's what the
[1:41:15] rest is now God's shown us three rests
[1:41:17] throughout throughout the Bible the
[1:41:19] first rest he gave
[1:41:22] he gave when God received the first rest
[1:41:24] he was when he was he rested from his
[1:41:27] own work the second rest was when Israel
[1:41:29] received it in the law and the third was
[1:41:32] when the church received it as a part of
[1:41:34] God you see the rest is the Holy Ghost
[1:41:39] foreign
[1:41:41] and if you're still fighting lust
[1:41:43] problems if you're still fighting
[1:41:45] cigarettes if you're still fighting
[1:41:47] personal things in your own life
[1:41:49] and you haven't received the Holy Ghost
[1:41:51] it shows that you can't have rest
[1:41:55] the rest
[1:41:57] is
[1:41:58] the Holy Ghost
[1:42:00] and to think that if Satan could get you
[1:42:02] brother Matthew that he'd have the whole
[1:42:04] world
[1:42:07] that's a powerful thought
[1:42:09] if Satan could get these little girls
[1:42:11] he'd have the whole word on because he
[1:42:13] tried his best to keep Israel out of her
[1:42:14] Homeland but he couldn't do it
[1:42:17] and he's trying his best to keep you
[1:42:18] from going in to a Rapture but he can't
[1:42:21] do it you will never stop a
[1:42:23] predestinated seed from fulfilling
[1:42:25] everything that the word of the Lord has
[1:42:27] said that they would be in this hour and
[1:42:30] we recognize that the predestinated gene
[1:42:32] seed of God is elected to cast down
[1:42:34] everything because she has taken the
[1:42:36] word of the Lord and she is whipping the
[1:42:39] devil with thus say of the Lord she
[1:42:41] ain't whipping her she ain't whipping
[1:42:43] the devil with her flesh she is whipping
[1:42:45] the devil with things that are to be and
[1:42:48] this is the reality of it
[1:42:51] you
[1:42:53] let me say this this is more than a
[1:42:55] green checkered shirt
[1:42:59] this is more than any bisco falling in
[1:43:01] the water
[1:43:02] just so he's got to go change his cert
[1:43:06] sheets sister Ruth biscoll what she
[1:43:12] she couldn't have thrown that shirt away
[1:43:14] because it was a part of the prophecy
[1:43:16] but this is more than a 42-inch caribou
[1:43:19] this is the reality of Isaiah this is
[1:43:24] the reality of Joel this is the reality
[1:43:27] of Acts 2 again in the bride's body
[1:43:32] wow
[1:43:45] resting
[1:43:47] that everything is all right
[1:43:52] you know Georgie Carter's mom
[1:43:55] was so upset
[1:43:57] she was so upset
[1:44:00] that this man William Branham had come
[1:44:02] into the country
[1:44:04] and got his daughter
[1:44:06] all excited
[1:44:08] and there she was laying there for nine
[1:44:10] years got down to 47 pounds and there
[1:44:13] she'd read a little book
[1:44:16] about faith
[1:44:18] and this mama got so upset
[1:44:21] got so upset because this man William
[1:44:23] Brenham was stirring up his little
[1:44:26] daughter
[1:44:29] when he was the one that was going to
[1:44:31] come by her way
[1:44:36] and bring them real rest
[1:44:39] right you think all those years
[1:44:42] watching your daughter in torment
[1:44:51] I would accept anything
[1:44:54] no matter how it came I would accept it
[1:44:58] but she was so upset because the way
[1:45:00] that they've been taught
[1:45:02] that this was wrong
[1:45:09] I'd say the miracle that you have need
[1:45:12] of
[1:45:13] is in this room
[1:45:16] and remember you remember what happened
[1:45:18] when she fell off to sleep sitting there
[1:45:20] at that table that she had this Vision
[1:45:23] dream that their Jesus come walking on
[1:45:26] the sidewalk and come walked up to the
[1:45:28] door and she was thinking about William
[1:45:30] Branham and all these things and when
[1:45:32] she looked it was William Branham
[1:45:36] coming to her door what was it it was
[1:45:39] Jesus in William Branham
[1:45:45] how many has had some real problems this
[1:45:47] week
[1:45:48] or throughout your life not every week's
[1:45:50] a bad week thank God
[1:45:56] but I'll say this
[1:45:58] that your Miracle walked in the room
[1:46:00] when Julia Frazier walked in when
[1:46:03] Randall Griffith walked in when Whitney
[1:46:05] Breeden walked in when Jerry Breeden
[1:46:07] walked in when Vernon Fraser walked in
[1:46:11] what if the person that's sitting beside
[1:46:13] you was the person that had the power of
[1:46:16] prayer to begin to pray over your
[1:46:19] situation when they walked in it doesn't
[1:46:22] matter if the preacher did it the Deacon
[1:46:24] did it or a sister back in the back
[1:46:26] prayed over me as long as it happens you
[1:46:30] remember the woman up there in the
[1:46:32] balcony that that they give up her seat
[1:46:34] for that little woman and she began to
[1:46:36] pray for her and she'd come through the
[1:46:38] prayer line and said you received your
[1:46:40] healing when that woman prayed over you
[1:46:43] it doesn't matter where it comes from
[1:46:45] just rest in his healing power
[1:46:49] you are as close to God right now as
[1:46:52] your next prayer
[1:47:05] well I can't get over the river
[1:47:09] he'll stand it up
[1:47:14] I know it's hard
[1:47:16] waiting
[1:47:18] but Abraham you're going to need more
[1:47:21] than you're going to need more than
[1:47:22] yourself to produce an Isaac
[1:47:26] but you are resting in the most high God
[1:47:33] a stand
[1:47:49] next weekend
[1:47:52] next Sunday
[1:47:57] is three years
[1:47:59] amen
[1:48:04] I don't know whether it happened or not
[1:48:05] on next Sunday or if it happened right
[1:48:07] now
[1:48:08] but through his completion
[1:48:10] and I accept healing
[1:48:20] three years since the angel of the Lord
[1:48:23] said if you'll trust me I'll use you
[1:48:25] like never before
[1:48:31] three years
[1:48:32] you've watched your pastor stand up here
[1:48:36] preach sick
[1:48:38] preach afflicted
[1:48:40] preach having seizures
[1:48:43] preached unstable preached with sugar
[1:48:46] that's that's over 600 600 on its scale
[1:48:50] when it's supposed to be 100
[1:48:52] and people get all upset when they're
[1:48:55] about 120.
[1:48:57] and he stood here
[1:48:59] in the face of every demon of hell
[1:49:02] and preach to you faith and preach to
[1:49:05] you trust and preach to you that it's
[1:49:07] going to happen
[1:49:08] he didn't give you some self-pity parlor
[1:49:11] where you got a pity him and pity his
[1:49:13] troubles
[1:49:16] he showed you what it's like to be a
[1:49:18] real overcomer
[1:49:22] trust me
[1:49:24] and I'll use you
[1:49:26] like never before
[1:49:30] if you abide in me
[1:49:32] and my words abide in you
[1:49:36] ask
[1:49:40] he's as close to you right now as your
[1:49:43] next prayer
[1:49:45] he's right here
[1:49:48] oh that I would
[1:49:50] that my people would call upon the name
[1:49:53] of the Lord
[1:49:54] and I'll heal their lands
[1:49:59] prayer is the most powerful thing
[1:50:03] it's amazing when you can go to prayer
[1:50:07] you can go to prayer
[1:50:10] you ever been in that that special spot
[1:50:12] of Prayer
[1:50:14] and you walk in and you're just
[1:50:17] you're everywhere in your thoughts
[1:50:20] you've got so much pressure on you
[1:50:25] it's like
[1:50:29] I really need to get up and I need to go
[1:50:31] back to work
[1:50:32] but I really need this
[1:50:34] I really need this time
[1:50:37] and when you really begin to pray
[1:50:41] not just uttering some words
[1:50:44] but you begin to break into a realm of
[1:50:47] praise
[1:50:49] because prayer is not Lord bless the
[1:50:52] Joneses bless the Williams's
[1:50:54] Lord Lord go over here and heal this one
[1:50:58] God's not an Aaron boy
[1:51:00] that's just running around on your
[1:51:01] command
[1:51:03] prayer starts with praise
[1:51:06] how did Jesus teach us how to pray Our
[1:51:08] Father
[1:51:09] Who Art in Heaven
[1:51:11] Hallowed be thy name what does it do it
[1:51:15] starts off with praise
[1:51:18] oh Father
[1:51:21] Hallowed be thy name
[1:51:23] thy kingdom come thy will be done on
[1:51:28] Earth
[1:51:30] not what I want
[1:51:33] not what I want
[1:51:35] thy will be done
[1:51:38] on Earth
[1:51:39] as it is in heaven
[1:51:42] give us
[1:51:44] this day
[1:51:47] Our Daily Bread
[1:51:49] forgive us our debts
[1:51:52] as we
[1:51:54] said well I really really need this to
[1:51:56] happen have you forgive your debtors
[1:52:00] so you could be forgiven
[1:52:05] prayer starts out with praise
[1:52:09] and all of a sudden you begin to
[1:52:11] I'm talking I'm talking about rest right
[1:52:13] here
[1:52:14] but you are so
[1:52:17] you got you got business things going on
[1:52:19] you got family things going on you got
[1:52:20] church things going on and man it's it's
[1:52:23] heavy on you this one's sick and that
[1:52:25] one's sick and you care for everybody
[1:52:27] and you love them and you want to see
[1:52:28] them get healed and you've got all of
[1:52:30] these problems but by the time you get
[1:52:33] out of prayer your enemy looks good to
[1:52:35] you
[1:52:36] have you had that type of prayer lately
[1:52:40] well you got into a room where it's just
[1:52:42] you and Jesus
[1:52:45] and by the time you got out of Prayer
[1:52:48] you forgot what you went in there was so
[1:52:50] burdened for
[1:52:53] be honest real quick when's the last
[1:52:55] time you prayed a prayer that you forgot
[1:52:57] about your problems
[1:52:59] [Music]
[1:53:01] it's okay
[1:53:03] I'm not I'm not condemning you
[1:53:06] Satan has a real way of keeping you from
[1:53:08] the most powerful thing
[1:53:10] but when you are breaking into prayer
[1:53:13] it is the most holy room that you could
[1:53:17] ever break into
[1:53:19] brother brother Bishop said that
[1:53:21] when he took his time to go out and to
[1:53:23] to take his watch at the campfire he
[1:53:26] went up there where brother Brandon was
[1:53:28] sitting at
[1:53:29] he said when I walked up there where
[1:53:31] brother random was
[1:53:33] he said it was like I'd walk into a
[1:53:35] Lover's chamber
[1:53:39] but William Branham was talking to the
[1:53:41] author of life
[1:53:43] he had tapped into a room
[1:53:47] I'm talking about prayer I'm talking
[1:53:49] about resting in prayer I'm talking
[1:53:51] about when you go into prayer with all
[1:53:53] of your troubles if God if you don't
[1:53:55] move upon this situation they're going
[1:53:58] to go by the way of the grave but by the
[1:54:00] time you come out of it you've got the
[1:54:02] faith of Abraham and you've got the
[1:54:04] strength of Samson and you've got the
[1:54:07] courage of David and you've got the
[1:54:09] knowledge of Solomon when you go into
[1:54:11] prayer you begin to break into rest real
[1:54:15] worship breaks you into a realm where
[1:54:18] the burdens leave you
[1:54:23] why don't you break into prayer
[1:54:27] break into your car break into your
[1:54:30] closet breaking the prayer while you're
[1:54:32] making mashed potatoes while you're
[1:54:34] making your cookies while you're working
[1:54:36] on your job why don't you leave such an
[1:54:38] atmosphere in your bedroom that you'll
[1:54:42] not walk back in there arguing but
[1:54:44] you'll walk back in there with a love
[1:54:47] like it ever before
[1:54:52] a prayer
[1:54:55] that it changes your language
[1:55:00] we no longer say my anxiety
[1:55:04] we no longer say my heart problems we no
[1:55:08] longer say my needs
[1:55:11] we say Satan you got to leave
[1:55:15] it was never your anxiety to begin with
[1:55:19] it was Satan's it was never your cancer
[1:55:22] diagnosis to begin with it was Satan's
[1:55:27] oh why don't you lift up your hands and
[1:55:30] why don't you lift up your voice and why
[1:55:32] don't you call on the god of Heaven
[1:55:36] Lord I miss you
[1:55:38] Lord this Christmas season I don't care
[1:55:40] I don't care what comes in my stock and
[1:55:43] I don't care what comes wrapped in a
[1:55:45] gift All I Want Is You The Giver of
[1:55:48] every good gift
[1:55:49] and your gift always seems to find Its
[1:55:52] Right Place Lord
[1:55:54] you know when I need healing and you
[1:55:56] know when to give it to me father
[1:55:59] but Lord as long as you're here I'm
[1:56:02] going to talk to you as long as you're
[1:56:05] here I'm going to worship you as long as
[1:56:08] you're here I'm going to break through
[1:56:09] as long as you're here father I ask God
[1:56:13] you not care about I didn't care about
[1:56:16] myself but I care more about the others
[1:56:19] around me let them Break Free let them
[1:56:22] have an experience let them have a
[1:56:25] breakthrough let them find the anointing
[1:56:27] let them get healed before me let them
[1:56:31] Father experience you let them feel the
[1:56:34] anointing of the Holy Ghost let them
[1:56:36] Father
[1:56:37] father
[1:56:39] if you could just spend a little time
[1:56:41] with me
[1:56:44] but only take a second to fix what I got
[1:56:47] going on
[1:56:49] Lord I pray that you'd be my sustainer
[1:56:52] and that you'd be my protector father
[1:57:00] Satan I rebuke you
[1:57:02] I rebuke you from touching God's
[1:57:04] children from touching God's daughters
[1:57:07] and touching God's Sons you have no
[1:57:10] legal authority to touch any one of us
[1:57:13] you have no legal possession you have no
[1:57:16] documents that say that you're liable
[1:57:19] that says that you're able to put your
[1:57:21] hands upon us but we by Isaiah 53 we
[1:57:25] stand here and say that by Jesus Christ
[1:57:28] drops we are healed
[1:57:31] my history Expressions we're made free
[1:57:34] by his action at the cross we're set
[1:57:38] free by his love that is shown towards
[1:57:41] us we no longer live in Wrath but we
[1:57:44] break into a realm of the Holy Ghost
[1:57:46] that was meant for us
[1:57:49] [Music]
