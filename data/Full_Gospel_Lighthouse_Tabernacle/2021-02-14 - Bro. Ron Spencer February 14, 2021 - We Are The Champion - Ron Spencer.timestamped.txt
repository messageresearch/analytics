[0:41] a way that you say ups and downs enough
[0:43] that i would advise you to go to god and

[0:48] again
[0:49] when trials and troubles and heartaches

[0:52] something holds not you holding
[0:54] something holding you
[0:56] see it is the question whether i hold on

[1:12] i've tried since 19 and 40 to get saved
[1:14] he said but i find myself not worthy i
[1:16] said you never
[1:18] will be worthy he said then i can never
[1:20] be saved i said oh no
[1:22] it isn't you it's him see
[1:25] god don't look at you he looks at him
[1:28] and if you can find any fault in him
[1:29] then you can't be saved but if there's
[1:31] no fault on him
[1:32] then you're all right the blemish that
[1:35] you find in him is on you but if there's
[1:36] no blemish in you
[1:38] in him then there's no finish on you he

[1:02:17] been around him a bit but brother greg's
[1:02:19] mess
[1:02:21] and he said
[1:02:24] he said while they were wrecking shannon
[1:02:26] was given play-by-play what to do what
[1:02:29] to do what to do
[1:02:33] and and he said they were
[1:02:36] he said just as soon as they stopped he
[1:02:38] said he flipped the switch office let's
[1:02:39] get out of here
[1:02:43] i want to hear them tell it and then
[1:02:45] maybe next week and
[1:02:48] brother greg said i've lost a couple
[1:02:50] inches from the seat belt
[1:02:55] amen
[1:03:00] it was it was about 9 30 at night and
[1:03:05] uh i was just thinking all of these
[1:03:08] things and
[1:03:10] they had been listening to christ the
[1:03:12] mystery of god revealed
[1:03:15] and so i'm i'm sitting in the
[1:03:19] i'm sitting in the uh in my living room
[1:03:23] or where we sit connie and i said you
[1:03:25] know when you get a little older you get
[1:03:27] a place to sit
[1:03:29] and so i'd have been a lot more amens on
[1:03:32] that dale
[1:03:34] but and i was just reading through
[1:03:38] christ the mystery of god revealed
[1:03:40] because i thought if this is the sermon
[1:03:41] of the day
[1:03:43] the angel of god was was a part was a
[1:03:46] part of this and so
[1:03:47] i was just reading and i and i come down
[1:03:50] to about
[1:03:51] in one edition it's uh it's about page
[1:03:53] 70 another it's a 131 and
[1:03:56] and i just come down and i hit a certain
[1:03:58] spot and i just felt something
[1:04:00] and so i just sent this i just sent this
[1:04:03] to my family and
[1:04:04] then i sent this to brother shannon
[1:04:07] and and brother branham was just saying
[1:04:09] he said he is the thing
[1:04:13] he was the prophets he was in them
[1:04:17] he was in the psalms he was in the
[1:04:20] history
[1:04:22] he was in the things to come the same
[1:04:26] yesterday today and forever
[1:04:29] hebrews 13 8. if you're writing it down
[1:04:32] you should be
[1:04:34] and he said he should be the principal
[1:04:38] if that's what he is we believe it don't
[1:04:42] we
[1:04:42] the congregation says amen then
[1:04:46] if he that is that
[1:04:50] then he should be your principle theme
[1:04:52] of talking
[1:04:54] of our thinking of our singing
[1:04:57] of our walks he should be the principal
[1:05:01] theme of our life
[1:05:03] and if he's the principal theme of the
[1:05:05] bible
[1:05:06] and the bible is in us
[1:05:10] he should be the principal thing theme
[1:05:13] of
[1:05:13] everything we do say or think
[1:05:17] should be christ
[1:05:20] and i just sent that right right quickly
[1:05:23] to brother shannon
[1:05:25] and here's what he's immediately
[1:05:27] response to me was
[1:05:29] brother ron that's the last thing i
[1:05:31] heard before we wrecked
[1:05:36] we had church didn't we yeah amen
[1:05:41] amen so i know the angel of the lord
[1:05:44] this message is more than just a message
[1:05:46] here at church or
[1:05:48] worldwide and and we just are we just
[1:05:51] are so thankful
[1:05:54] brother shannon actually sent me a text
[1:05:56] this morning
[1:05:57] it was a text to his wife but he sent it
[1:05:59] to me
[1:06:06] it's valentine's day
[1:06:18] couldn't have sent it to a better
[1:06:19] preacher he could not have sent it to a
[1:06:22] better preacher
[1:06:27] i'm not going to give you the details
[1:06:30] i know you're sitting there eagerly
[1:06:31] waiting but
[1:06:33] that was for her and i'm glad it was for
[1:06:35] her she
[1:06:36] she deserved every bit of that now and i
[1:06:40] agree with him
[1:06:42] amen now i know what he calls you though
[1:06:45] i know what he calls you
[1:06:52] but it couldn't have been more timely
[1:06:55] and the reason i mentioned that is
[1:06:58] because of
[1:06:59] you who dream know that if you get
[1:07:02] startled
[1:07:03] especially at the end of the dream you
[1:07:05] remember it very vividly
[1:07:08] and dreams happen in seconds
[1:07:10] milliseconds
[1:07:12] and they're just their brother brandon
[1:07:14] would stand in a vision
[1:07:15] right before a person and see their
[1:07:18] entire life
[1:07:19] and it doesn't sound like he breaks a
[1:07:21] sentence
[1:07:22] but that's just how quick it happens for
[1:07:25] a
[1:07:26] spiritual dreamer there's an atmosphere
[1:07:29] that comes with the dream
[1:07:33] and so i was startled by by just the
[1:07:36] sound of the text
[1:07:39] i normally turn my phone off but last
[1:07:41] night i didn't
[1:07:42] and just i got just got startled at the
[1:07:44] sound of the text
[1:07:46] just before just before uh
[1:07:49] about five between 5 30 and 6 o'clock
[1:07:53] i think this will bless you and that's
[1:07:56] why i want to
[1:07:57] just kind of share this with you it sure
[1:07:59] blessed me
[1:08:02] brother denny uh it seemed like that in
[1:08:05] the dream we had been invited to a
[1:08:08] meeting
[1:08:10] it was a meeting to where that looked
[1:08:11] like a small building
[1:08:13] but a massive crowd
[1:08:16] you don't sometimes you just don't know
[1:08:18] how to correlate things
[1:08:20] small building massive crowd and sister
[1:08:23] connie and the
[1:08:24] boys were sitting beside of me and we
[1:08:26] were sitting in a line and
[1:08:29] and we were sitting very near the stage
[1:08:32] and i was sitting on the end of the i
[1:08:35] i was sitting about where you are
[1:08:38] and as i was sitting there little did i
[1:08:42] know
[1:08:43] that brother branham was going to be the
[1:08:44] speaker
[1:08:47] brother bran was dressed in a very
[1:08:49] beautiful
[1:08:51] beautiful whitish suit and i just don't
[1:08:54] have a name
[1:08:55] quite how what the color would be but it
[1:08:58] would be somewhere between ivory and
[1:09:00] white
[1:09:02] and and maybe somebody that's in the
[1:09:05] color industry could help me with that
[1:09:07] out there
[1:09:08] but it was a suit that
[1:09:11] it was a suit like i'd never seen it was
[1:09:13] a fashion of a garment
[1:09:15] that had never seen quite like it and it
[1:09:17] looked so incredibly comfortable
[1:09:20] as i watched him he not necessarily did
[1:09:22] he
[1:09:24] did he preach
[1:09:27] but he just kind of spoke and he just
[1:09:29] kind of told a few stories
[1:09:32] and it seemed like in the background
[1:09:35] you could hear a humming from another
[1:09:38] realm
[1:09:40] and the humming was was the song
[1:09:43] on the wings of a snow white dove
[1:09:48] and as i sit there and absorbed in that
[1:09:50] atmosphere
[1:09:53] brother branham was a young man
[1:09:57] and we all just knew we were in a
[1:09:58] special place
[1:10:03] brother brandon walked over to me right
[1:10:05] after he
[1:10:06] finished speaking and he walked over to
[1:10:09] me and he had a
[1:10:10] he had a book in his hand and the book
[1:10:13] was a green bound book and it was one of
[1:10:15] the original books i
[1:10:16] i have one in my in my desk
[1:10:20] and it's a it's the way of a true
[1:10:22] prophet
[1:10:24] and that's the sermon that my dad
[1:10:27] came to the lord that believed brother
[1:10:29] branham was a prophet
[1:10:31] and so i heard that many many many times
[1:10:35] in my life and brother branham just
[1:10:38] looked at me and said
[1:10:41] would you like to have this book and he
[1:10:44] just kind of held it out to me like that
[1:10:48] when he did i looked at him and i just
[1:10:50] looked into his eyes and i said
[1:10:52] brother branham i have believed this
[1:10:55] message
[1:10:57] all my life now this is the first time
[1:11:01] i've ever dreamed of brother branham
[1:11:03] i believed this message all my life
[1:11:08] and i preached it all over the world
[1:11:15] and i've tried to do my best
[1:11:24] he just looked at me and he said ronald
[1:11:28] and he just patted me on the cheek
[1:11:31] he said ronald
[1:11:34] you're going to get well
[1:11:56] seemed like the dream went just a few
[1:11:58] more moments and we
[1:12:00] we walked out of the building together
[1:12:04] he looked at me and said would you like
[1:12:06] to get your picture took with me
[1:12:10] i said i sure would brother branno i'd
[1:12:13] love to have my picture took with you
[1:12:16] and he stood right beside of me the boys
[1:12:18] william was there
[1:12:20] and the boys was there and sister connie
[1:12:22] was there
[1:12:24] he was standing beside of me he just
[1:12:26] reached over and patted me on the
[1:12:28] shoulder and he said
[1:12:30] homer be here in a few moments
[1:12:36] i believe he will too
[1:12:40] now it might not have done anything for
[1:12:42] you this morning
[1:12:47] but i've had a prophet come to me in the
[1:12:49] night
[1:12:51] and he's told me and i believed him all
[1:12:54] my life
[1:12:56] and he stole me from that realm he
[1:12:58] called me by my name
[1:13:02] and he told me i'm going to get well
[1:13:06] and i just so happen to believe it
[1:13:19] [Music]
[1:13:24] [Applause]
[1:13:30] hallelujah
[1:13:34] now maybe you flip the screen on you can
[1:13:36] stand but maybe you've
[1:13:38] flipped the screen on for the first time
[1:13:40] and don't know what's going on here
[1:13:43] but they say
[1:13:47] they say that i have store four stage
[1:13:50] cancer
[1:13:53] brain tumors that are malignant
[1:13:56] and also in my lungs and and trying to
[1:13:59] attack my
[1:14:00] kidneys and dr dr renahan just called me
[1:14:04] not this last wednesday but the
[1:14:06] wednesday before and had a conference
[1:14:07] with me
[1:14:08] she said we speak of you every day
[1:14:12] here at the cancer center since you're
[1:14:14] setting records you're a miracle
[1:14:16] you're an absolute miracle said if you
[1:14:19] can make two years
[1:14:21] you'll be in the one percent category
[1:14:26] and i said i believe i'll make it
[1:14:40] and so when i when i get to see the
[1:14:42] cancer doctor on the 24th i'm going to
[1:14:44] tell her i know i'm going to make it
[1:14:47] amen i know i'm going to make it
[1:14:50] amen isn't he good to us amen
[1:14:54] sometimes he just sends us little things
[1:14:56] by
[1:14:57] faith and just kind of sparks this and
[1:15:00] you know i i get letters every week that
[1:15:03] from people that's got cancer and

[1:15:22] to his congregation and and to the area
[1:15:25] there
[1:15:26] well i sure i sure wasn't expecting it
[1:15:28] but
[1:15:30] but when when it came my lot in life i
[1:15:33] i want this body to be a place where god
[1:15:35] can do a miracle
[1:15:38] and his brother royce roosebury said it
[1:15:40] would be a
[1:15:41] a lion's den to where no one had ever
[1:15:43] walked out of
[1:15:45] and boy it's been a really tough battle
[1:15:47] it's been a battle for a year
[1:15:49] we take chemo treatments and dr renahan
[1:15:51] told me just the other day
[1:15:53] she said you're on the highest chemo
[1:15:55] treatment the most advanced that we've
[1:15:57] got
[1:15:59] and so i asked her i said what did what
[1:16:00] if i would go off of it maybe 30 days
[1:16:02] and
[1:16:03] get a break from it she said we'd be
[1:16:05] right back at square one
[1:16:08] but but we want to thank god for being a
[1:16:10] healer
[1:16:12] we want to thank god for being a healer
[1:16:14] maybe there's people that don't believe
[1:16:16] in doctors but
[1:16:18] i thank god for good doctors and they're
[1:16:20] believers and
[1:16:22] and uh they're believers in god and and
[1:16:24] so they pray with me and
[1:16:26] talk with me and have been a real
[1:16:28] encouragement to me
[1:16:29] and i'd like to thank you for every
[1:16:31] prayer that you have prayed for me
[1:16:32] throughout this last year and so we

[1:17:22] he has been faithful in that only just a
[1:17:24] few moments

[1:18:01] faith and
[1:18:03] i'd never been allowed to to say that
[1:18:05] before
[1:18:06] so so i've said it now
[1:18:09] and you know i'm not the one that has to
[1:18:11] bring it to pass god said it's going to

[1:18:20] and i'm going to treat it that way
[1:18:23] i'd like for you to turn with me to
[1:18:24] first john chapter 1 and verse 1.

[1:19:07] moment

[1:19:31] seen it
[1:19:31] and bear witness and show unto you
[1:19:35] that eternal life which was with the
[1:19:38] father
[1:19:40] and was manifested unto us
[1:19:43] that which we have seen
[1:19:47] and heard declare we unto you
[1:19:51] that you also may have fellowship with
[1:19:53] us and truly our fellowship
[1:19:55] is with the father and with his son
[1:19:58] jesus christ
[1:20:00] and these things right we unto you that
[1:20:02] your joy
[1:20:03] may be full this then
[1:20:07] is the message which we have
[1:20:10] heard of him and declare unto you
[1:20:14] that god is light and in him
[1:20:18] there is no darkness at all
[1:20:23] amen maybe you have a need on your heart
[1:20:25] this morning you just like to raise it
[1:20:26] before the lord and
[1:20:30] amen almighty god we love you with all
[1:20:34] of our hearts
[1:20:36] and today has already been a very
[1:20:38] special day in the spencer home
[1:20:41] and lord now we ask you that you would
[1:20:44] come and touch our hearts and minister
[1:20:46] to us
[1:20:46] as we would speak lord now we ask you
[1:20:51] that you'd come in a mighty way
[1:20:54] lord just settle this audience into an
[1:20:56] atmosphere of angelic anointing
[1:20:59] lord of a special place of where we're
[1:21:02] at and what is taking place
[1:21:04] oh god minister to us just even now
[1:21:08] every hand that has been risen mine
[1:21:11] included
[1:21:12] lord i ask you to give me strength in
[1:21:15] the moment that as i speak
[1:21:18] give me vocal strength give me energy
[1:21:21] this morning
[1:21:22] i pray that you'd bless even my wife and
[1:21:25] touch her body
[1:21:27] she's been so faithful to care and take
[1:21:30] care of me
[1:21:31] and god as i've prayed lord don't let me
[1:21:35] be a burden to nobody lord and lord you
[1:21:39] came and brought us an assurance this
[1:21:41] morning
[1:21:42] oh god thank you for a visit from that
[1:21:45] realm
[1:21:46] touch us even now anoint these words
[1:21:50] place them exactly where they need to be
[1:21:53] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[1:21:56] and amen and amen you may be seated
[1:22:11] we realize and we have been speaking to
[1:22:13] you on a champion
[1:22:15] over the last few weeks
[1:22:18] and we realized that you cannot be a
[1:22:20] champion without being trained
[1:22:24] and the training has to come even
[1:22:28] sometimes from another from another
[1:22:31] realm because you can have talent
[1:22:33] but there's a lot of people that are
[1:22:35] talented
[1:22:37] that get nowhere in life
[1:22:40] actually most talented people become
[1:22:42] lazy people because they rely on their
[1:22:45] talent
[1:22:47] and then they become uncommitted people
[1:22:49] because they
[1:22:51] they rely on the talent that they've got
[1:22:54] and so it squandered
[1:22:56] in life
[1:23:00] in the in the carnal realm
[1:23:04] even the militaries the united states
[1:23:08] has a
[1:23:08] a readiness program for their military
[1:23:14] they don't have two weeks to get ready
[1:23:16] for battle
[1:23:17] they don't have a year to get ready for
[1:23:19] battle there has to be a front line of
[1:23:22] men that are ready
[1:23:26] that are tuned in not
[1:23:29] not hours to be ready but seconds
[1:23:34] to be ready jesus was speaking
[1:23:37] 2 000 years ago and he told us to be
[1:23:41] ready
[1:23:43] brother homer's last sermon would be be
[1:23:46] ready
[1:23:48] listen these things are not by chance
[1:23:52] and it's not just somebody else getting
[1:23:54] us ready
[1:24:00] you gotta be ready everybody
[1:24:04] especially in the olympic season
[1:24:07] everybody wants to be the one with the
[1:24:09] gold hanging around their neck
[1:24:11] but you don't realize the cost of the
[1:24:14] hours and years that it has taken for
[1:24:17] them
[1:24:18] to stand on that stage and then
[1:24:21] even in the moment everything has to be
[1:24:25] exactly
[1:24:26] right for the performance
[1:24:31] the performance to be ready that they
[1:24:34] would be at
[1:24:35] their top notch every muscle every
[1:24:38] twitch
[1:24:39] every reaction even the food that they
[1:24:42] eat
[1:24:42] they watch over it as it's going in they
[1:24:45] make sure they're not putting any
[1:24:47] pollutants in their body
[1:24:48] they don't want nothing
[1:24:52] nothing to deter especially as they're
[1:24:55] getting into the
[1:24:56] final phase of the training i believe
[1:24:59] that's where we are as a bride
[1:25:03] we're not a little girl anymore
[1:25:06] [Applause]
[1:25:07] listen when brother branham starts
[1:25:09] talking about in 62 the heavens are
[1:25:12] announcing
[1:25:13] the bride on the earth and then after
[1:25:16] the seals from one
[1:25:18] from the opening of the book from one
[1:25:20] sermon to another sermon
[1:25:22] brother man said i'm no longer probing
[1:25:25] when you hear when you hear the sermon
[1:25:27] christ the mystery of god revealed
[1:25:30] let me just say this you never a man
[1:25:33] had had the ability to be able to stand
[1:25:36] and the entrusted word
[1:25:37] to be able to stand and stand at a
[1:25:40] pulpit
[1:25:41] and speak a sermon like christ the
[1:25:44] mystery
[1:25:46] of god revealed
[1:25:50] are you with me from one summer sermon
[1:25:54] after another
[1:25:56] brother branham in his last five sermons
[1:25:58] would talk about the
[1:25:59] gene seed of god
[1:26:05] his last of course his last statements
[1:26:08] was at a communion service but there was
[1:26:10] a service just before that called
[1:26:12] leadership
[1:26:14] he will say more in that sermon
[1:26:18] than any leadership course
[1:26:22] or book that you will ever read in your
[1:26:25] life
[1:26:28] because he is preparing a group of
[1:26:31] people
[1:26:34] to live and reign in another dimension
[1:26:38] and not just there but we would be able
[1:26:41] to
[1:26:42] have comfort that we're walking in two
[1:26:45] worlds
[1:26:46] at the same time even now
[1:26:53] we watch brother branham walk in two
[1:26:55] worlds
[1:26:57] speak in two worlds just to bring you
[1:27:00] to a couple thoughts a man named
[1:27:03] spurgeon
[1:27:04] who's one of the greatest preachers to
[1:27:06] ever live on the earth
[1:27:07] a man named spurgeon initially
[1:27:10] because of the printing press came on
[1:27:12] the scene
[1:27:14] just before him and he was one of the
[1:27:15] first preachers to take advantage of it
[1:27:18] and he would and he would have every
[1:27:21] sermon
[1:27:22] every sermon would be ready and go to
[1:27:25] press
[1:27:25] and as you would walk in the building
[1:27:27] they would hand you the sermon
[1:27:29] and he would preach that sermon that
[1:27:31] weekend
[1:27:32] and they would print into the hundreds
[1:27:35] of
[1:27:36] thousands of of each sermon
[1:27:39] and he had a school of preachers
[1:27:43] and he was a different sort of a man but
[1:27:46] he had a school of preachers and
[1:27:48] and i'm not trying to point you to him
[1:27:50] just now but many of you read his
[1:27:52] his morning devotionals and evening
[1:27:54] devotionals he's got great things to say
[1:27:57] you have to weed your way through the
[1:27:58] trinitarian doctrine but that's
[1:28:00] that's all the light that they had it
[1:28:01] that day but anyway
[1:28:03] i read it i read it every morning and so
[1:28:06] anyway
[1:28:07] anyway anyway spurgeon would say that
[1:28:11] we have this in copy form and there's
[1:28:14] actually some of the sermons actually
[1:28:15] went into the millions
[1:28:17] because some sermons had more power than
[1:28:19] others just like all of us have
[1:28:21] and then but he he would tell his
[1:28:23] ministers he said
[1:28:25] don't you dare touch that book of
[1:28:26] revelations that seals
[1:28:29] because there's going to come a profit
[1:28:31] [Applause]
[1:28:33] and he will reveal those seals
[1:28:38] and then he would say this for that
[1:28:39] would be astounding to me he said now
[1:28:42] we have been given the opportunity to to
[1:28:45] get
[1:28:45] the script to where we could we could
[1:28:47] reproduce it in
[1:28:48] book form he said but there will come a
[1:28:51] time
[1:28:53] to where they'll be able to catch it
[1:28:56] and be able to hear the voice
[1:28:59] of that prophet
[1:29:05] so we realize as brother branham i'd
[1:29:08] like to take you back
[1:29:09] into a couple of sermons here brother
[1:29:11] branham says in countdown
[1:29:14] he said we're not living back in the
[1:29:16] horse and buggy age
[1:29:19] now that was good for its day as a
[1:29:21] matter of fact
[1:29:23] in some of even the greatest
[1:29:24] civilizations the fastest thing
[1:29:27] on the earth was a horse right and so
[1:29:31] horse was a coveted animal especially if
[1:29:34] it was a fast horse
[1:29:36] the olympics that even when jesus was
[1:29:38] here there was
[1:29:39] there was games that would go on paul
[1:29:41] would talk about those
[1:29:42] games and paul would write many
[1:29:45] different verses
[1:29:46] based on the influence of those games
[1:29:50] many run but one gets the prize
[1:29:53] let us lay aside every weight and the
[1:29:55] sin which does so easily beset us
[1:29:58] are you with me and let us run
[1:30:02] and he would tell us they do it for a
[1:30:04] carnal realm
[1:30:05] but we do it for an immortal
[1:30:08] [Applause]
[1:30:09] just kind of gathering your thoughts now
[1:30:12] and so
[1:30:13] we can see that civilization was pushing
[1:30:17] forward
[1:30:17] but jesus should stand on the earth two
[1:30:20] thousand years ago
[1:30:23] and he would tell us about what kind of
[1:30:25] time that we would be
[1:30:27] in we would be at in as it was in the
[1:30:30] days of
[1:30:31] noah so will it be in the coming of the
[1:30:33] son of man
[1:30:35] as it was in the days of lot sodom and
[1:30:38] gomorrah
[1:30:39] so will it be in the coming of the son
[1:30:41] of man
[1:30:42] seven dispensations later
[1:30:46] we are living in the conditions that
[1:30:49] jesus
[1:30:49] talked about
[1:30:51] [Applause]
[1:30:53] are you with me 2 000 years ago jesus
[1:30:56] talked about there would be a people on
[1:30:59] the earth
[1:31:00] and he would ask a question when i
[1:31:02] return
[1:31:03] will i find faith i'd like to stand here
[1:31:06] and amen it today
[1:31:08] i'm here
[1:31:09] [Applause]
[1:31:15] the scripture would tell us behold i
[1:31:17] send you elijah the prophet
[1:31:20] before the great and dreadful day of the
[1:31:23] lord
[1:31:25] and and let me just say this you there
[1:31:27] is a people
[1:31:28] that catch the message
[1:31:34] and let me just say it was more than a
[1:31:36] preacher
[1:31:38] it was more than an evangelist
[1:31:41] more than a prophet
[1:31:44] because a lot of people even in that day
[1:31:47] saw the angel of the lord
[1:31:49] and they missed the message a lot of
[1:31:52] people fell in love with the messenger
[1:31:54] and missed the message but the message
[1:31:58] is jesus christ
[1:32:01] that's the mystery to you you
[1:32:04] are the mystery
[1:32:07] the mystery is your name was written in
[1:32:10] the book
[1:32:11] and you're living in this day and you
[1:32:13] can read your name in this book
[1:32:16] and realize who you are
[1:32:24] in hebrews 11 it talks about
[1:32:27] men of faith and women of faith by faith
[1:32:30] enoch
[1:32:33] and you read nowhere about his family
[1:32:37] but by faith enoch he walked with god
[1:32:42] and he was so perfect until god took him
[1:32:47] and he would be a type being the seventh
[1:32:50] from adam
[1:32:51] of getting a translation
[1:32:55] there is a people on the earth that's
[1:32:58] walking in a realm
[1:33:02] yes adam's going on yes the governments
[1:33:06] are
[1:33:06] corrupt yes the world is is falling
[1:33:10] apart
[1:33:11] yes fukushima had a massive earthquake
[1:33:14] yesterday at 7.4
[1:33:17] earthquakes are happening everywhere
[1:33:21] it's supposed to be that way yes we've
[1:33:24] got scoffers
[1:33:26] yes we've got our critics but it's
[1:33:29] supposed to be that way
[1:33:32] somebody asked me the other day how do i
[1:33:34] dress my critic
[1:33:36] and i told them thank them because
[1:33:39] they are vindicating you
[1:33:41] [Music]
[1:33:46] they're not trying to tear up brother
[1:33:48] brother oral roberts or
[1:33:50] billy graham people leave the message
[1:33:53] and they have such a hatred against the
[1:33:55] prophet
[1:33:56] and the preachers till they turn around
[1:33:59] don't just walk away
[1:34:00] but they turn around and hate it
[1:34:04] they're anointed to do that to prove to
[1:34:07] you that you
[1:34:08] are who you are
[1:34:20] it's a part of your training
[1:34:25] it's a part of your training because if
[1:34:29] it's just your
[1:34:30] whim of a thought you can't stand on
[1:34:33] that
[1:34:34] if it's just a sensation that went up
[1:34:36] and down your spine a
[1:34:38] time or two in a service that will hold
[1:34:41] you
[1:34:42] but when you have went through wars
[1:34:47] in this realm and god has watched over
[1:34:50] you
[1:34:51] he's guided you he's been your thinking
[1:34:54] he's been your thoughts he's been your
[1:34:57] songs
[1:34:58] he's been your joy and he's went through
[1:35:01] with you through the valley of the
[1:35:03] shadow of death
[1:35:04] and you come to a point in your life
[1:35:11] there's nothing that can shake you from
[1:35:13] this infallible truth
[1:35:29] brother branham said you must realize
[1:35:30] that satan is not scared of me
[1:35:33] so if we take that he's not scared of
[1:35:36] you
[1:35:38] but he said he's scared of who i
[1:35:40] represent
[1:35:41] so if we take that he's still to who i
[1:35:44] represent
[1:35:45] [Applause]
[1:35:51] and then brother random if you notice in
[1:35:53] just the next sentences
[1:35:55] he says i hate him
[1:36:00] and he hates me
[1:36:04] you think for a second that them crazy
[1:36:06] democrats and republicans up there
[1:36:09] love each other they have told you over
[1:36:13] the last year of how much that they
[1:36:15] disdain
[1:36:16] each other's
[1:36:20] they have showed that they are
[1:36:22] absolutely from the pit of hell
[1:36:24] [Applause]
[1:36:40] they might say go how i love jesus at
[1:36:43] their little
[1:36:44] normal church services
[1:36:47] but they're not proving it in their
[1:36:50] halls of congress
[1:36:57] that's how much satan hates you
[1:37:01] if he could
[1:37:05] go get my little blue knife back here on
[1:37:06] my desk
[1:37:09] if he could he'd destroy you
[1:37:12] in a moment's notice
[1:37:18] his meetings in hell is about you
[1:37:26] internet the meetings in hell
[1:37:29] is about you
[1:37:33] now in the journey that i'm in
[1:37:37] about a year ago they they gave me a
[1:37:39] death sentence
[1:37:42] and then the next few weeks a year ago
[1:37:47] they removed a tumor somewhere between
[1:37:49] the the size of a lemon
[1:37:53] just above that and it was fully
[1:37:56] malignant and it spilled out into my
[1:37:58] brain and then there's two more that's
[1:38:00] in there
[1:38:01] and then the lungs were full of tumors
[1:38:05] and i would say after a year satan is
[1:38:09] about to decide
[1:38:11] i didn't bring enough
[1:38:21] i carry this in my pocket every day
[1:38:24] brother alden gave it to me and he had
[1:38:26] it
[1:38:26] made from case themselves
[1:38:30] and they inscribed on it for me
[1:38:33] he don't have enough
[1:38:35] [Applause]
[1:38:39] now i don't know who the worker was that
[1:38:42] was
[1:38:43] inscribing that on my knife that i'm
[1:38:45] going to carry the rest of my life
[1:38:48] i bet he looked at that and he went he
[1:38:51] don't have enough
[1:38:58] [Applause]
[1:39:00] what is what is that saying
[1:39:03] he don't have enough well i want to
[1:39:06] explain it just in case he gets this
[1:39:08] sermon
[1:39:09] yes satan brought his best
[1:39:12] [Applause]
[1:39:14] and he got his biggest baddest demon
[1:39:18] yeah and he said you're going to go into
[1:39:20] ron spencer's body
[1:39:22] and you're going to send tumors
[1:39:24] malignant all over his body
[1:39:26] and you're going to kill it take all the
[1:39:30] help that you can get

[1:49:30] actually more than he preached about
[1:49:31] heaven so it's a real place
[1:49:35] so let me go over to goliath's camp just
[1:49:37] for a few minutes
[1:49:39] you know a lot of people really liked
[1:49:41] goliath they looked up to him
[1:49:45] they looked up to him they see his
[1:49:47] muscles
[1:49:48] they could see his height they could see
[1:49:50] his stature
[1:49:52] and they'd watched him kill man after
[1:49:53] man after man
[1:49:56] but none of them believed today was his
[1:49:59] last day
[1:50:00] [Applause]
[1:50:05] he got up and he ate his 12 eggs for the
[1:50:08] last time
[1:50:13] he ate all of his pancakes for the last
[1:50:16] time
[1:50:18] he shook his big old brownie head for
[1:50:20] the last time
[1:50:22] he started putting his armor on and
[1:50:25] everybody was doing and gone
[1:50:27] but they didn't realize he's doing it
[1:50:28] for his last time
[1:50:31] satan i want you to listen to these
[1:50:32] sermons
[1:50:35] [Music]
[1:50:37] we're doing this for our last times

[1:50:42] change
[1:50:46] and you can have this earth you can have
[1:50:49] their government
[1:50:50] you can have all the cars you can have
[1:50:53] all the sports arenas
[1:50:55] you can have all your music you can do
[1:50:57] what you want to
[1:50:59] but call me gone
[1:51:03] come on
[1:51:08] [Music]
[1:51:19] he walked down off of the hill
[1:51:22] and he started screaming again just like
[1:51:25] he'd been doing for a long time
[1:51:28] but his problem was somebody showed up
[1:51:33] that could do something about it
[1:51:40] you know the denomination they can
[1:51:42] scream and they can holler
[1:51:45] dress any way you want a dress ain't
[1:51:47] whipping no devils like that
[1:51:50] but when he shows up here he showed up
[1:51:53] at a good place to get whipped
[1:51:55] [Applause]
[1:51:57] i could hear down in hell satan starts
[1:51:59] sending out his
[1:52:00] notices go down there to
[1:52:03] go down there to
[1:52:07] to spotswood trail
[1:52:10] go down there and you have to go to
[1:52:13] service
[1:52:13] please dope please don't send me down
[1:52:17] there
[1:52:18] do you know who they got singing
[1:52:22] he's wild
[1:52:25] [Applause]
[1:52:27] and his brother's big and pruning
[1:52:31] if he can't whip me in the flesh he went
[1:52:33] in the spirit
[1:52:36] and that that resonated god's wild
[1:52:40] and those people that go there i
[1:52:42] remember what they used to be
[1:52:46] we used to have a host of those people
[1:52:48] and
[1:52:49] they don't live like they used to
[1:52:53] and when we show up at their house they
[1:52:55] kick us out yes
[1:52:58] they take that book and run us out
[1:53:01] every time
[1:53:12] know there'll be times to where that we
[1:53:14] feel like we've almost got them
[1:53:15] and they'll we can even make them think
[1:53:18] doubtful
[1:53:19] thoughts and then all of a sudden
[1:53:21] they'll go hey wait a minute
[1:53:24] hey hey wait a minute that didn't come
[1:53:27] from god that came from the devil
[1:53:29] now satan you take that thought you take
[1:53:32] those words
[1:53:33] and get out of here because greater is
[1:53:37] he that is in me than he that's in the
[1:53:39] world if you abide in me and my words
[1:53:41] abide in you
[1:53:42] ask what you will and it shall be done
[1:53:45] unto you
[1:53:46] [Applause]
[1:53:52] brother brahm said i'm so glad that a
[1:53:54] man could so completely serve god till
[1:53:56] the devil don't know what to do with him
[1:53:58] i want to fulfill that quote in my life
[1:54:02] i want to be that kind of a people
[1:54:12] just a reality check here am i preaching
[1:54:14] like a man that's got stage four cancer
[1:54:22] [Music]
[1:54:23] [Applause]
[1:54:24] [Music]
[1:54:30] he knows that if the people
[1:54:33] get the true revelation of the true
[1:54:36] church
[1:54:38] and what she is and what she stands for
[1:54:44] and that she can do
[1:54:48] the greater works she will be
[1:54:52] an invincible army
[1:54:56] now you know that quote can lay there
[1:54:58] for a long time
[1:55:00] and not have any effect but when you get
[1:55:04] it
[1:55:09] when you get it when you get it
[1:55:21] satan's got a problem let me just say it
[1:55:24] let me just say it in a real good manner
[1:55:26] in a behavior moment when you get it
[1:55:30] not when somebody tells you but when you
[1:55:32] get it
[1:55:34] not when somebody convinces you but when
[1:55:36] you get it
[1:55:41] when you get it when you get
[1:55:45] when you get it when you get it
[1:55:48] when it's more than just a good theory
[1:55:51] when it's more than just a good idea
[1:55:54] but when you get it when you really
[1:55:57] figure out who you are
[1:56:07] worried about you worried about covet
[1:56:09] brother on i got something a lot worse
[1:56:11] than coping
[1:56:13] [Music]
[1:56:15] but when you get it
[1:56:17] [Applause]
[1:56:18] when you get it this is more than just
[1:56:22] about going to church and getting your
[1:56:24] favorite pew
[1:56:25] but when you get it when you figure out
[1:56:29] hey
[1:56:29] i'm the one that god's talking about i'm
[1:56:32] the one that that little prophet was
[1:56:34] talking about
[1:56:36] [Applause]
[1:56:38] when you realize that you are the
[1:56:40] attribute of god that god thought of
[1:56:42] before the foundation of the world
[1:56:44] and he had a little prophet saying you
[1:56:46] were on your way
[1:56:47] and you have arrived and when you stand
[1:56:50] up with this message that is thus saith
[1:56:52] the lord
[1:56:53] and look the devil in the eye
[1:57:01] come on that's why satan fights you so
[1:57:04] hard
[1:57:05] because you take a word that he knows
[1:57:07] he's whipped by
[1:57:11] [Music]
[1:57:12] come on he how many of you at times the
[1:57:14] devil's whispered in your ear and said
[1:57:16] that ain't the truth
[1:57:19] let's go ahead and raise your hands he's
[1:57:21] whispered in your ear that ain't the
[1:57:22] truth that he tried to make you doubt it
[1:57:26] do you know that booger was in
[1:57:29] every prayer line
[1:57:33] he was in every prayer line and he stood
[1:57:36] there and tried to get the people to
[1:57:37] disbelieve
[1:57:38] all over the building black lines and
[1:57:41] shadows everywhere
[1:57:42] and and and the people's name were
[1:57:45] called their addresses

[1:57:49] different things
[1:57:50] and he watched them full of cancer
[1:57:56] go from here to here
[1:57:59] and there was no shadow no more
[1:58:08] the scripture said that the devil
[1:58:09] believes in one god
