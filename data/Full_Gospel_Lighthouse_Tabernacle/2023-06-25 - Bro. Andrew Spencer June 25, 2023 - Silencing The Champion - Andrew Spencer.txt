arised in your children's life today that they would see the power of the Resurrection Lord Jesus Lord instead of the problems instead of the things that we face I pray father that our eyes would be turned upon you now Lord Jesus we thank you God that there is a cross that we can look to and we pray today as you would come today through the speaking of Thy word that you would come and you would let the anointing of Thy word begin to move across this this congregation today and begin to pour out your spirit now father I know that there are needs here that only you can meet and I would ask Lord Jesus that you would come father we surrender ourselves to you just now we get ourselves out of the way and we ask father that you would just come father may we see you high and lifted up today we are looking unto you the author and the finisher of our faith our pastor Wally is yet speaking there in North Carolina I pray a special touch upon his body that you would heal him Lord and let the the Holy Ghost roll over his body father and drive cancer out in the sickness away we have been put here to destroy this cancer demon he is not here to control us but we're here to control that father we thank you Lord Jesus for all these other needs here father we know God that you're on the way Lord and we know that the answer is here in the room so father we ask Lord that you would just take control of this service let it be a benefit to thy kingdom today as we dedicate our life to you in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen and amen if you have your Bibles this morning would like to look over in the scriptures of first Samuel chapter 17. first Samuel chapter 17 and verse 4 and also Matthew chapter 27 and verse 26 again this morning first Samuel chapter 17. and verse 4. I'd like to speak to you again this morning pick up where we left off last evening on silencing the champion and there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines named Goliath of gath whose height was six cubits and a span and he had a helmet of brass upon his head and he was armed with a coat of mail and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass and he had Grieves a brass upon his legs and a target of brass between his shoulders and the staff of his spear was like a Weaver's beam and his Spears head weighed at 600 shekels of iron and one bearing as Shield went before him and he stood and Cried unto the armies of Israel and said unto them why are you come out to set your battle in Array and not I a Philistine and you the Servants of to Saul choose you a man for you and let him come down to me and if he be able to fight with me and to kill me then will we be your servants but if I Prevail against him and kill him then shall ye be our servants and serve us and the Philistine said I defy the armies of Israel this day give me a man that we may fight together and when Saul and all of Israel heard those words of the Philistine they were dismayed and greatly afraid Matthew chapter 27 verse 26 Matthew chapter 27 and verse 26 there amen isn't he good to us this morning amen then released he Barabbas unto them and when he had scourged Jesus he delivered him to be crucified then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common Hall and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers and they stripped him and put on him a Scarlet robe and when they had planted a crown of thorns they put it upon his head and a reed in his right hand and they bowed the knee before him and mocked him saying Hell King of the Jews and they spit upon him and they took the Reed and smote him on the head and after that they had mocked him they they took the robe off from him put on his own Raymond on him and led him away to crucify him and as they came out they found a man of Cyrene Simon by name him they compelled to bear his cross and when they were coming to a place called Golgotha that is to say a place of a school may God bless his word he may be seated today in the presence of the Lord so Seb would like to speak to you again on this thought on silencing a champion brother Burnham makes this statement several times but he said one day when Adam's race was backed into a corner where the law and the judgments and the prophets and everything had been sent and failed nothing could be done human race was doomed the great armies of hell was marching on well trained and in their ranks and every man to his place he said they'd backed Adam's children into the corner where they could go no farther they sent the law they couldn't keep it they sent judgments they wouldn't listen to it they plunged right on and they sent the prophets they stoned those and nothing could be done they were backed into a corner but in glory one day the most precious thing of Heaven stepped out before the angels of God and said this day will I give my life for the sons of Adam this day will I do something that'll break the ranks of the enemy the angels all said what will you do what will you do he came to the Earth as a virgin and at Calvary when he went to Calvary stood on this Earth and preached the gospel he said I'm going to give you some material I want you to go up to the city of Jerusalem and I want you to wait therefore I'm going to dress you I'm going to make you soldiers to fight against The Wiles of the enemy but first before you go into the Battlefront go up to Jerusalem and wait there and I want and what I give you you follow me and fight as best as you can and he said there on that dark day of Calvary the Lamb of God the precious son of God that came down from Glory never taken the way of a denomination he never taken the way of some easy Road he never taken the form of some ecclesiastical system but he went to the darkest and roughest part of the spears the Valley of the shadow of death he grabbed all of death and threw it into his bosom and he died a hero when he sit down the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost as I said I want to speak to you on this thought on silencing the champion and last night we left you in a spot with Goliath down in the valley but this morning I want somebody to do something for me I want you to wake that Goliath up and tell him that it's his day to die I hope you had a good night's sleep down there Goliath we left you down there all night thinking about what's coming today but wake up there's a storm coming wake up David wake up David it's your morning too you've been rise up for this moment for this hour and we recognize that that God's going to do something special on this day that we watch these two dramas God is getting ready to do something that has never been done before we've got two scenes that are set before us two Champions that are set out before the children of God that they they show up and they're constantly warring against the children of God breathing threatening lies down upon them and a champion a champion is somebody that has never lost to somebody it's a champion that undertakes a combat it's a champion that fights in the cause of somebody else he's known as a mercenary he's he's known as a warrior he's known as the as the enemy of death he is known as one that challenges and he does not lose and these two Champions have come to this come to this Valley or come to these moments and they've come here with a purpose in mind so that they would win the battle but today is a different day we look and we see one is the descendant of the anakims he's over nine foot tall he he weighs over 700 pounds in his natural abilities David only weighed 110 pounds death Wade had all of the statures of killing men thousands of men millions of men and had never lost but there was a man that weighed under 150 150 pounds it didn't matter how big he was brother random said he was a small man in stature he said the angel of the Lord is about six foot tall he said but Jesus is a real small man here here's this man weighing under 150 pounds but it isn't the size of the dog in the fight it's the size of the fight that's in the dog and this man Jesus Christ is looking at something that has never been defeated there have been great men that look death in the eyes but this day was going to be a different day because death was going to meet God face to face they had looked about it they had talked about it all the ranks of Hell had looked about this one they've seen his actions as the Messiah but brother Branham said that the cross was the greatest was the seal the final seal to his messiahship and here as Jesus is going and making his Triumph up to calvary's heel Satan doesn't even realize what he is about to do he would have never done what he was going to do on this day if he would have really known that Jesus was the son of God if he knew that he was going to bring that much threat to his kingdom he'd never allow those Roman soldiers to stick that spear in his side or to hang him upon that cross but today is a different day today death does not reign as a champion no more today Goliath does not reign as a champion no more you said well I'm looking at the battle from my natural eye and it looks like Goliath he's about 600 and 680 pounds more than what David is if you're going to look at this battle with your natural eye you are going to lose because the Bible says in second Corinthians 4 and 17 that our light Affliction which is butter for a moment working for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory while we look not at the things which are seen But of the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temperable but the things which are not seen are Eternal that means that they are without beginning and they are Without End they never cease so the things that you cannot see in this room today the victory that you need in your life is not going to end come on somebody you are looking at a victory through the resurrection you're not looking at a victory through some man's doings you're looking at a victory through the Eternal God that said that you was going to win the battle we are not looking at the things of the temporal world the things that you're constantly battling things of the trials and the Sorrows of life you see if you keep your mind fixed holy upon the sicknesses that you face in the battles that you fear and the things that you're going against every little light and brief suffering is going to cause you great turmoil in this life but if you can just simply turn your eyes turn your eyes away from sickness turn your eyes away from pain what am I saying to you I'm saying that you've got to get your eyes off of Goliath and you've got to get your eyes upon the Battle of what God has said that there is a word [Music] I know that I'm a little bit ahead of myself here but I want you to know that there is prophecy that will take you through your temporal moments because the Bible said I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared to the glory which shall be revealed in you and I so Goliath is only working for my good foreign every little trial every little toothache every little headache every little thing that you go through is simply working things out for the good because Christians are not designed to look at the problems Christians are designed to look at the promise if that was not so then Moses when he looked out the same window that Pharaoh looked out he would have simply seen the same thing from Rosine which was mud daubers and slaves but when Moses took a look out that same window he seen a promise on a people that were slaves people that were beat people that were in turmoil he was looking at the same things but through a promise and if you can look at your problem through the promise the problem is over if you need a provider he is your provider if you need somebody to take you and be your Providence he is that kind of a God let me tell you if he could take George Washington because of across a frozen Delaware River with Providence on his side he knew that he was going over there and he was taking an army that didn't have shoes on their feet they were freezing but they were men that had believed and prayed to almighty God George Washington teaches us a very powerful statement and a very very powerful key in life if you can be persistent in your prayer life you can pre persistence in your battles the battle is spent 90 percent time in prayer my brother Brandon said that David when he come to this battle he didn't even have to pray through because God had already prayed him through him this guy ain't never been beat this guy has never he's never lost a case he's went out time and time again and he brought back the spoils to the Philistines but this day was a different day these things are built for a purpose the trials that you're in the troubles that you're in are built for a purpose but we recognize that we as Christians we recognize that our whole armor is Supernatural that we are not relying upon the things that we see because you cannot be a Christian and have to see the thing you cannot see you cannot you cannot see your faith but you can see your works you cannot see the holy spirit in this room but you can see the effects of the Holy Spirit you cannot see your Victory as it's coming to pass right now but you see the manifestation of the word as it's being coming and to pass you see you are up against a great obstacle you are up against Great needs you are up against big things but you need a supreme god that made a supreme promise and a supreme result will come to pass what am I saying is that this God is superior to all others and brother random said in looking at the Unseen that when a man once catches that vision of the invisible God and knows that he's always present that there's something that stabilizes that man's thinking it stabilizes his actions in the time of distress it'll still make him look upward and above the things that are happening around him because he's looking at the Unseen yet by a promise so you've got to go beyond what you see you've got to go beyond what you feel you've got to go beyond your Consciousness you've got to go beyond your imaginations to find a supernatural God come on now if you sit there in your condition if you sit there with what you see you are simply going to allow Goliath to win the battle but I believe with everything that's within me that there's some Davids in the room today okay let me tell you you cannot just tell this Goliath to stick his sock in it and keep your mouth shut you've got a job to do the things that keeps whispering in your ear of complexes and stigmas of things that I'm not well I'm not good enough I always deal with this you cannot simply say stick a sock in that keep your mouth shut you've got to deal with the thing you see you've got to come to a spot where the enemy cannot make you compromise you've got to come to a spot like Joshua when he was coming down to the end of his ministry and he said choose you this day whom you're going to serve whether you're going to serve the gods of Egypt or whether you're going to serve the god that is the god of Heaven I cannot imagine anybody in the right mind going out and serving a God that will beat you that will whip you that will put you in Chains put you in a mud pit make you a slave beat you slay your children antagonize you constantly whip you constantly attack you but Joshua's saying choose you this name if you want to be beaten if you want to be destroyed if you want to be antagonized go out there and serve that God but as for me and my house first for me and my house we are going to serve the Lord he said well I don't see anybody going out there going down in the mud pit oh yes you do you see a lot of so-called Christians that are still dressing like the world dancing like the world acting like the world but today's a day where you choose it is choosing day you either let Goliath through your life you let complexes rule your life you let stigmas you let jealousy you let bitterness or you're going to choose to serve the god that is able to cast to cast things down to clock cut his head off is well I'm not able to do it let me tell you what you've been given has the ability to cut his head off jealousy is not going to win in this Arena bitterness is not going to win in this Arena when the world tries to slip in and stick its polish upon our young girls and stick its ideas upon our young boys we say we're going to be different laughs you're living in a world where everybody you see out there is weird and they look on you as the weird ones they look on you and think man why in the world are they still dressing like that don't they know that we're in the 21st century that we can do whatever we want to let me tell you something there's not one ounce of me that wants to look like the world dressed like the world act like the world there ain't nothing Goliath has upon his armor that I think that I need upon my body I don't need a spear I don't need his Target of brass I don't need his shekels of iron I don't need anything that Goliath's God because when I get done with the Goliath he will be able to carry it no more he might be 700 pounds but he won't be able to carry this 200 pound of armor when I get done with him come on somebody the giant you might be facing might be close to a thousand pounds but the word of the Lord says take his head off there ain't a cancer devil too strong for the rock that David's got in his hand they're in a tuberculosis demon out there that is too big for the rock that David's got in his hand I hope it's okay today but they're in a depression or an oppression a stigma a complex an idea that is bigger than the rock that David's got in his hands it's time that we give Goliath a makeup change and we show him who's boss in the arena come on somebody he's been roaring for 40 days we're the message of the hour but he's been ruined for 40 days we got the most powerful God on our side but he's been roaring for 40 days come on now he Wars in your flesh he Wars in your mind and he Wars in your soul he roars he whispers he lies he tells you things that are going to come to pass he tells you things that you're going to live with this the rest of your life let me tell you something I have listened to that devil over and over and over again I spent hours in my study I've spent hours in my study and Satan's standing back there so you better not preach that they're gonna get mad at you and papa says go ahead go ahead go ahead you're gonna make people mad they're gonna get upset on you they're gonna get mad at you papa says you go right ahead you preach them the abilities that they have the abilities to cut Cancer's head off to cut suicide's head off couldn't do to cut depression heads off to cut the rest of the Wilderness off what is it there is a word of the Lord that is greater than the lives of the enemy the enemy will try to make you compromise and not live the word preach the word and be the word but papa says you can do it you can do it you can live this message the Goliath stands out there said send me somebody down here and we'll serve them or you'll serve us but we're not here to compromise let me tell you we've had enough of the devil trying to come into the ranks of the message and say that these things are not the way that they used to be we've had enough of the devil trying to slip in under the walls and try to come under the word and try to push things upon our young people and push things Upon Our ideas upon upon our own our brothers and sisters Veterans of the message and makes him think that it's okay but I'm not serving a dead God I'm serving to God I'll be honest with you god ain't looking for some hoochie God is looking for somebody that knows how to dress the message live the message and be the message if God wanted to rest to the world he'd went out there and got them but God is looking for a Ruth and he's looking for a Rahab yeah you gotta but you gotta pass yes you got a history but when God gets done with you you're not known like that no more you don't dress like that no more you don't act like that no more what is this about this is saying that there's a land it's a Holy Ghost Land it's a redeeming land there's a power in this land let me tell you if the king wanted vasty he could have had her but God ain't wanting a vasty when he can have an Esther come on message people God ain't one he ain't One Nevada dresses herself up the way that she wants to he's wanting an Esther that dresses the way that the king wants her to dress [Applause] another random said if I had 20 lives to live or a hundred lives I'd want every one of them for the Lord Jesus he said if there wasn't a heaven to go to afterwards I'd still want to serve the Lord Jesus for the peace and satisfaction that I have of knowing that he lives and because how he lives I can live also is what I can live with this I've got by with it so far brother Branham said he said you better destroy your enemy before your enemy destroys you I can deal with this doping I can deal with this smoking I can deal with this dipping you better destroy your enemy before your enemy destroys you it's okay if we quote the prophet in the Pulpit here today you better destroy your enemy before your enemy destroys you because Goliath has got the strength Goliath has got the power Goliath has got the mentality Goliath has got the ideas he's a warrior and he's looking for somebody that's easy to take so you better destroy your enemy before your enemy destroys you how do we do it William hanum bring back them old-fashioned prayer meetings old-fashioned repentance when they stay to the altar until they was dead and finished with sin you never seen a woman go to the Altar and die to sin and next day come back with bob hair painted on her face and there's no such the Holy Spirit teaches nature does the nature of the Holy Spirit he said you never seen a woman going out there dressing sexy and coming in and trying to cover themselves up you never seen a man that was afraid to stand up and Afraid his little wife would leave him or something another because he took the initiative well man we're men in them days and they spoke like they were men and they governed their own house that's for me and my house we gonna serve the Lord what are you talking about brother Andrew I'm talking that I'm on this altar I'm on this altar I'm on this altar I'm here laying before the Lord Lord whatever it takes I come to this cancer giant time and time again and I look him in the face and I see him whispering all kinds of threats but I go to a rock that's higher than me and I speak these words Lord if there's anything in my life that would hold Randy Hinkle back from getting completely delivered or Ron Spencer or Erica Parker or this brother brother brother Donnie and sister Betty anything if there's anything in my life what is what are you saying I'm saying we're her body and the body cannot operate at full power unless we're operating at the same speed but if you can get the man down in the engine room and the man up top saying the same thing and going in the same room in the same realm you are going to break into a realm of impossibilities so if I can get my heart right and I can get my spirit right and I can get my flesh so much Sanctified that all of a sudden hell don't know what to do with the Church of the Living God David knew what he was doing walking down into this Valley Jesus knew what he was doing climbing up that hill he had enough power to stop all of them in their tracks he could have stopped the spit in their mouth before it ever got out their lips he knew what he was doing but Jesus don't care what you do to him on the way to the cross spit on him knock on him make fun of him curse him this is for you Doug Bowman this is for your family let them spit on me because I think you're worthy enough I think you're great enough I think you're righteous enough I'm gonna let him spit on me I'm the god that created heavens and earth I'm the god that spins worlds into existence right off my fingertips but I'm gonna let my own creation take the saliva that I created in their bodies to wet their lips and wet their mouths when they're in a dry spell I'm going to allow it to form in the back part of their mouth and I'm going to allow them to spit on me so that they can't spit on you is this man Worthy I'll say he is you see what am I doing this for it's because this thing that you constantly face in your own life has never been defeated you live to a certain age of 70 to 80 years old and you constantly go by the way of the grave man is appointed to death and he's given a spotter and last spot of time to 70 years old and anything over that is the grace of the Lord but he is saying that I am going to be their propitiation that I am going to offer up my life once and for all so that you don't have to bear the power of sin upon your life I'm going to take it upon my flesh I don't know sin but I'm going to take your sin you better know what you're doing when you go down in this Valley because when you get in this Valley you're going to get scarred you're going to get made fun of you're going to get ridiculed you're going to get spit on people are going to say you're too small you ain't big enough don't know the message don't have the Holy Ghost you better know what you're doing you better know what you're doing when you walk into this Valley you're too Ruddy you're too young you're not big enough you're not strong enough you better have a revelation that that champion is his last name you better be able to look like Through The Eyes of Jesus Christ and see that this is the last day that death Reigns over my mortal bodies hahaha Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah because what Satan is wanting to do to you is disarm you by his Whispers of Lies because brother Bynum would say that your weapon is powerful it's the greatest weapon that's ever been given unto mankind was the word of the Lord but if Satan can make you feel like your weapon is inadequate he's got you whipped right there and he's disarmed you because he's got you to disbelieve that your weapon is powerful enough but notice notice when William Branham goes into and he goes to break into the Philadelphian Church age in Revelations 3 and 8 he said I know thou Works he said behold I've set before thee and open doors that no man can shut it for thou has little strength and has kept my word and has not deny my name and when brother Branham goes in there to break into this break into this uh Church age here the Philadelphia Church age that there he begins to show us a lap over and you remember that brother by him that the Lord shows brother around him a dream of a of a man that is beating this woman brother Brown thought it was his mom at first and there that man was beating this this woman with a three-corner club which we knew was Triune baptism and every time that she would go to receive power that that man would begin to beat on her and we recognize that that woman was the churches of the world but that man was the denominations that was ruling her he said but notice he said he said if these people can't see the truth of the godhead but fight it he said can never see the rest of the truth because the Revelation is Jesus Christ in his church and his works in the midst of the church for in the seven Church ages he said do you get that he said now I'm sure that you understand and it goes in the scripture thou has a little strength and has kept my word and not denied my name he said now we have already mentioned how the strength was returning he said it was the power of the Inquisition had Wane and people had left their home lands and demanded a freedom of worship he said the Yoke of hierarchy was being broken the governments were finding it was not wise to Champion one segment against another in fact well-meaning but poorly LED people were willing to wage war to defend their religious rights you see the age that they were living in under the man age they had the abilities and they had a tenacity to wage war for their religious rights so what were they warning against they were warring against a society or or a power that was wanting to shut down the move of the Holy Spirit but notice he said he said but perhaps the greatest show of strength of the religion in this age was the fact that throw though France failed in the revolution that the great Wesleyan Revival kept the revolution away from the Great Britain and saved her to be an instrument in the hand of God for many glorious years he said the preaching of the word was never greater as Satan raised up his hordes of free thinkers as organ Originators or Originators of Communism rose up as liberal theologians spread their filthy waiters he said but God raised up Mighty Warriors of the faith he said the greatest works of Christian literature and teaching and preaching came from this era he said never has it preachers and teachers been matched and never will they be he said there was spurgeons Parkers McLarens Edwards and bunions and muellers and brainards and barns and Bishops and all came from this era they preached and taught and wrote the word and they glorified his name so the Bibles is telling us of this age that their strength returned by keeping the word and out of this age came some of the greatest preachers that ever has been they could they as far as theologians there's nobody in this age that could compare to those men under the anointing of the man age so they are the strength that they had was because they kept the word they preached the word they taught the word he said but it did not have the open door of power that it ought to have had so you can have the abilities to preach the word you can have the power to preach the word but you do not have the demonstration of the word so they were they were they had they were able to hold men Spellbound Charles Finney was able to stand upon upon upon a bow and stand out there and preach and Men five miles away would drop their lunch pails and give their heart to the Lord Jesus Christ these were men Spurgeon which was the prince of peak preachers over 88 000 sermons but they did not have the ability to express the power of the word that they were preaching he said it was only in a few scattered groups they did not have the power that was there laying in the word but brother Branham when he come to the seat is not heir to the shuck he said but at the opening of The Seven Seals of Revelation 10 he said the full word is to be born in a manifestation again and Vindicated by the spirit of God in the full strength as it was when he was here on Earth so they didn't have the strength that you have because the seals were still on the book but because the seals were released it made you realize that there is no weapon that has formed against you shall prosper what they had was so great but what you have is magnified on top of that it's because the anointing of the eagle has taken their strength to another level let me dumb it down for you a little bit I'm saying that the strength that you need has returned I'm saying the power that you need to overcome is in the room I'm saying that you don't have to live with the devil another day either we realize what we've got in our hand or we let the devil run over top of us it's time you take the opening of word you take that sling and you start whirling it into the air break the atmosphere break the situation in your life come on now you got family members that are constantly dealing with the same thing if you're still circling the same Mountain it's time that you move on if you're in the same spot that you was five years ago it tells me something about your spiritual life but I want you to know that there's ground for you to take there's an anointing here to make sure that if you take one step I am with you that I'll never leave you and I'll never forsake you I will be with you even in you to the end of the world it doesn't matter what the opposition you face David you're more than able to do it I'm saying to you that death is on its last ride when we recognize that when when William Branham breaks into the fourth seal and he goes in there and he shows us that pale horse rider that he's riding out there and he comes under the conglomeration of all the mixtures of the ages we recognize that he was trying to hide himself in the first and second and third Rider but he comes out boldly showing that his name was death in the fourth beast but there is a power to combat the power of death hallelujah what is it it's Isaiah 59 and 19 when the enemy comes in like a flood God raises up a standard death does not have a hold on you Church you don't know how that makes me feel that I can tell my people that death is on his last ride because you are on another Power you're not riding this power to the Grave you're not riding this power to a bottomless pit you're riding this power into a body change I'm talking to a people that are getting ready to change the mentions they didn't let nothing stick on them they wouldn't magnetize through the world they were magnetized to the word whoa glory to be the god what are you looking for this word is our Chariot that take us right out of here well I'm gonna take a trip on that good oh Gospel Ship glory to God that's your on your last ride but I'm on my ride home Hallelujah I will not let death reign in my mortal bodies I won't let sin reign in my body this ain't some Disney fairy tale I'm telling you about I'm telling you that if you let the things of the world go God is going to lift you out of this whole world he's ain't a packing up time when we pack up the world and try to put more on WE simply let the things of the world go Hallelujah it's time oh Lord forgive me y'all forgive me for the next little bit I may not be able to hold myself together up here what am I saying to you I'm saying that Old Devil that's been whispering in your ear he woke up for the last time this morning that complex his head that you're going to deal with fact for the rest of your life that you'll never be associated with the message of the hour today he woke up for the last time well he said I ain't going to receive it today but somebody here is somebody says I'm a David I'm a legend of this I'm called to this Hallelujah Hallelujah somebody's gonna break some psychos somebody's gonna press the battle Hallelujah Hallelujah I want you to know that there's a reward there's a reward coming to you if you fight for this God didn't raise somebody that's wimpy and don't know how to use a sword he had men like Peter Cartwright he had men like William Branham he had men like Paul he had been like Ron Spitzer he had men like Homer Fraser he had men like Henry green he had men like he had men like us standing in this hour that they could say I must fight if I'm going to reign character is a victory and if you want Power you better have some character with it because character power without character is satanic there's a lot of people that can feel the anointing of the Lord there's a lot of people that get under the inspiration of it when the Holy Ghost Falls in here but they go out and still live the same way that they're living in but God is looking for a character Hallelujah that can walk down into the valley of the shadow of death and they will fear no evil David he said what's going to be given to the man that rolls away the reproach of Israel and kills his philistine you know that they had gotten such a spot that the need and the situation that got so desperate that Saul needed to offer a three-part bride he was offering his princess he was offering a cash offer and he was offering a tax exemption that the man that kills this Goliath him and his house will be free and always right here let me tell you what you get in battling this you get the princess you get to live free and you get some money with the deal let me tell you the price is right come on down what am I saying to you that there's a reward for you fighting in this battle there's a reward for the god that rolls away the reproach of this and David recognized that there was a reward there and the rest of the men of Israel were looking at physical life out there said man he's too big for you his brother said man what are you doing down here uses the rule already old thing he said you just come down here to see the battle but they didn't recognize that David was the one that was getting ready to receive the Lord and roll the reproach away from Israel you see the rest of the world or the rest of the Israelites were focused on the material things but David was focused on the reputation of Israel and the honor of his living God because the Bible said that David was a man after God's Own Heart he cared about the things that God cared about you see he saw the problem in spiritual terms not in fleshly terms when the men of Israel said said this man David said this uncircumcised Philistine he recognized him as more than just a man but he recognized him as an enemy to the Covenant when the men of Israel said surely he has come up to defy Israel David said that he should defy the armies of the Living God when the men of Israel said the man who kills him David said the man who kills this Philistine he put his name where he was he identified him he didn't baby him around he simply identified the problem the man that kills this Philistine and takes away the reproach from Israel so David was looking at things through the eyes or the perspective of almighty God the only way to silence The Voice is to cut his head off both these champions and screamed 40 days and four thousand years foreign but you got to take his head off you say well I'm not strong enough and I'm not good enough I'm not big enough let me tell you you just simply put the word before you and the enemy will fall you've got example after example in the Bible but the Bible tells us in first Samuel 5 that when they took the Ark of the Covenant and put it in the temple of Dagen that they put it up there and they were trying the Philistines were trying to hide it from the children of Israel and David and all of Israel back there they were trying to hide it back there that they stuck it in there in the house of Deacon and when they put the ark before Dagen that they that that day can fell before his face so they stood Degen back up they stuck him back up there but when they put the ark back in his rightful position or when the ark was there they put Dagen back up there but this time when they came in in the morning Dagan's head and his palms had completely fell off so it is assigned to you that your enemy that you are facing does not have a head and it does not have hands to bind you oh come on now buckle up it's time to take some heads off and the Bible said in verse 43 that the Philistine said unto David am I a dog that thou cometh to me will stays and the Philistine cursed David by his gods now you know David must have thought that was real cute here he is David is serving the god that is the god of Heaven he created worlds with his words serving a God that took men over the Red Sea when there was an enemy that was chasing them down he knows who he's talking about but here this awful listening comes out there 700 pounds in his natural flesh got 200 pounds of armor upon him and he starts cursing him by his Gods can you imagine Goliath carrying his little out there with him dusting it off in the morning today is going to be a good day I'm going to curse David by my little Idols let me tell you something I ain't got to carry my God my God carries me and this old giant starts cursing the family of God by his little gods and the Philistine said to David come to me and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air and to the beasts of the fields so what is he saying brother random said that he was going to take that Spear and pick David up and put him up there on that tree so that the birds could come and pick on him foreign where's that one that little Griffith boy he said it's a beautiful day it's a beautiful day oh my it's a beautiful day hey y'all enjoying y'all's Jesus I know you're in a valley but if you can trust me for a minute you're gonna come out David says to him you meet me as a Philistine in the name of the Philistine with an armor with a spear and all your psychology and Theology and everything else that you got there but David said thou cometh to me with a sword and with a spear and with a shield but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts the god of the armies of Israel whom now has defied this day I'm not waiting till tomorrow I'm not waiting till next week I'm not waiting till the next prayer line I'm not waiting to the next Revival but this state where the Lord delivereth thee into my hand and I will smite thee and take thy head from thee and I will give the carcasses of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air so David recognized what was David doing he was prophesying he didn't just say you he said but all of the Philistines I'm gonna give their carcasses to the fowls of the air into the wild beasts of the Earth at that the all the Earth might know that there were a God in Israel and all verse 47 and all this assembly shall know that the Lord's saveth not with sword and spear for the battle is the Lord's and he will give you into our hands brother Branham said he knew where he was Hallelujah every day that's sitting here tonight you're positionally in Christ Jesus God has confirmed it election calling anointing placing he elected you and called you he elected you called you then anointed you with the Holy Spirit and now he's placed you in the body of Christ each one of you's Davids where's that Goliath who's the Goliath brother Branham he said that cancer that's eating you up that tumor that's hanging on you them cataracts on your eyes that crippled arm everything looks as it says it can't be done the devil says you might as well quit believing you might as well settle down because you can never no more get well your doctor said so all the rest of the world all the rest of them said so you can't get well but the Christ that made you stop your drinking made you stop your smoking and lying and stealing that saved you from a life of drunkenness from riling and from sin in the devil's grave if God can do that for you if God can do that for you he can save you from your TB from your cancer he's a Goliath but don't take his voice stand in the name of the Lord Jesus and challenge him to a showdown amen hallelujah the Bible didn't say that David ran for cover the Bible said that David hastened himself and he ran towards the battle he ran to meet the armies come on I'm looking for a giant to stand up today because I got a rock that's got his name on it I ain't running from this I'm running to the battle I ain't getting weaker I'm getting stronger [Applause] come on somebody God didn't bring you down here so that you can lose take a good look at me because this is the last thing you're going to see Goliath remember this face you crazy I know remember this face you imagine that the Giants that you face the last thing that they see is your mug shot he has wanted for shouting the house down He is wanting for praising God when he shouldn't he's wanted for taking the word of the Lord as his shield and as his book he's wanted for casting out Devils he's wanting for preaching the word he's wanting for praying when he shouldn't be praying yeah you got the right guy she's wanted when she prays through something happens she's wanted because it seems like every single time that her children get in trouble that she goes to prayer and she breaks into a realm she's wanted because she knows how to get in touch with God yeah you got the right woman standing up here this is the last one that you see last man last woman I'm talking about you you are everything that God is looking for now smile for your picture it's going to hang on The Wanted purges in Hell want it for preaching want it for the message wanted for living a true life wonderful holiness take a good look I'm the last guy that you see on this day [Applause] if you can believe it you've got enough power you got enough power to do the impossible what are you looking at I caught a glimpse of my victory and Jesus on the cross looking through the blood reeling in his body pain and misery start seeing a little Challenger start buzzing around days of Miracles have passed I got able I got Daniel I got David I made all them fall and I'm getting ready to take you and Jesus is hanging there looking through the blood as he sees the sting of death as he's kind of floating around there and he said I've been looking for you for a long time there's one that has antagonized you this one that's whispered in your ears of depression of anxiety pains in your body Jesus ain't looking out there and seeing a champion he's looking out there and seeing his victory I have looked for you for all of these ages but now in my flesh you see this bee had came and he had stunned David and it took him to the Grave it had stunned Daniel and it took him to the grave and it stung Abraham and it took him to the Grave it stung Adam and it took him to the grave but this body was a prepared body it was a virgin born body Hallelujah and when the be of Death stuck his finger in Jesus forgive me give it back give it back give it back but it stuck it into a new flesh of Flesh that was prepared and death had lost its figure give it back give it back give it back give it back oh no I've not taken death away I'm not giving it back to you you see them out there you see them 2 000 years from now I'm doing this for them so that they recognize that there is an opening of the word that they have received more than just an Acts 2 anointing but in Revelations 10 I only tell you David you're down in the valley you might as well go ahead and do it brother Byron said that he went down there and he grabbed five of them stoned and he wrapped them up in his fingers in one place brother random said that he stuck those stones down in the script bag that he was using for a sheep he said when he pulled him out he said they was full of honey what is it is honey on the rock and he starts whirling out there I practiced for this I prayed about this I spent time alone with almighty God I've been in prayer I've been in prayer and it feels like the burdens ain't going to leave me but I just kept on praying it felt like I was never going to get the Holy Ghost how about I kept on praying it didn't look like this one was coming but I kept on praying and I just kept slinging my sling of faith and I knew what I had in it and I kept praying brother said I just kept praying and I just kept believing and brother Bynum said that when you get that when you get that pollination of Faith put on there and all of a sudden you begin to whirl those things together brother Bynum said that the Holy Ghost got into that slingshot I can't do it I'm not big enough I'm not good enough but I kept praying but the Holy Ghost got in that slingshot it don't matter if you're good enough it don't matter if you look right it don't matter if you look the part let the Holy Ghost get in it [Applause] that devil was built for a purpose but you're built for a purpose put the word on your hips he's the same yesterday today and forever I'm the Lord Our God that heals all of that as he says I can do all things through Christ Jesus no weapon that is formed against me shall prosper we will be them be there with our Offspring also it don't look like it's coming but let the Holy Ghost get in your slingshot Hallelujah bless the Lord O my soul and forget not all of his benefits yeah he though I walk through the valley for the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thy rod and thy staff they comfort me that prepares the table before me in the presence of my enemies surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I would dwell in the house of the Lord forever the Lord is my light the Lord is my selfish [Applause] oh you got it in the suite you got that stone in there saying it you prayed for this moment you asked I can feel you in the room you asked for me to destroy this thing you prayed to God this week that I would come to you I'm here I'm here come on now you can leave this message but I've fallen I've got away from the Lord I've got away from my friends I let jealousy creep in your lifted once you can live it again Peter walk on water again Hallelujah you got a purpose you got a plan he's standing out there in front of you he's standing in front of you he ain't running from him he gonna be running from you the next time you see this John he's going to be laying on the ground in front of you I call that devil out in the street and I'd open up both barrels on him and I'd unload a double barrel shotgun on him this morning you have robbed me from living this message you have robbed me from my health you have robbed me from my Holiness you have robbed me for my virtuous life you robbed me from my joy you robbed me from my peace David David foreign so big 700 pounds brother Branham said that he was so big that David got on top of him matter of fact brother Burnham said in the message of preparation he said David danced on top of him he said that little Holy Roller come rolling down in the camp one day and he danced on top of him danced on top of him what are you gonna do what we gonna do with it what are you gonna do with it now the Lord's here to do this but David I want you to recognize you prophesied where you were going don't doubt your prophecy don't doubt your prophecy you already here in the valley you've already made your way down here you've already killed the giant but you've prophesied don't turn on your prophecy you said this day I will take your head off of your shoulders and David began to look around ain't got a sword in his hand but he looked over there and sing Goliath sword yes well I don't have a sword oh yes you do what appeared in the prophet's hand not a king sword but the king's sword you got it in your hand little bride be the message what am I saying to you brother Randall it's time that we parade Goliath's head all around town come on now you got some diets that you want to carry out of here go ahead and start walking parade that Giant's head around here paraded around here I'm taking my family back I'm taking my joy back I'm taking these things and the devil's right for me I parade them around this room right now yeah if it takes me I'm gonna do it cancers Rob my family and it's tried to destroy this church it's time that we parade this devil all around town he's alive to you he done told you you ain't good enough he done told you ain't gonna get healed you might as well parade him around town I'm taking my joy back I'm taking my dance back I'm taking my piece back I'm taking my battle back I'm taking my sword back [Applause] foreign [Applause] that David placed Goliath's head upon that spear now I got a phrase from my buddy brother Timothy Pruitt he told me to school drag that devil but brother Timothy and some brothers were over there in Israel while back and they were over there and they were down in that Valley of Eli they were down here in that Valley and they took him up to a spot and said it seemed like it was just an ordinary spot no really no markers around it or whatever but they said this is the place where they hung a life's head it was a major Crossway it is known as the place of the school and where did Jesus hang death but on thou gotha's Hill the place of the school so Jesus Took death all the way up to the same place that Goliath's head hung upon so this champion lost when he fought David and this Champion lost when he fought Christ it was in the same spot I'm going to tell you young people you're in the same spot that your Mamas and your daddy's got the Holy Ghost you're in the same spot where they got healed you're in the same spot and we're serving that God says the same yesterday today and forever this ain't some just ordinary ordinary walkway but this is a major Junction in a place where everybody that was traveling by they seen the head of that Goliath that everybody knew that there was a God in Israel I want to hang the head of cancer so high that all the world sees that he's the god that heals Ron Spencer [Applause] you're at a junction you're at a moment um told us when he preached the junction of time he said these things happen when we're at a junction Angels appear Miracles return profits arise he said you see carnal impersonations out there don't you get worried about them Cardinal and person haters they're supposed to be there but what about this and what about that don't get your eyes on them look at the angels that are here look at the prophets that is here look at the supernatural that is here it shows to you that you're in a spot where Goliath's head is hung so high whether Andrew I fought these things in my flesh I've been wrong I've hurt others I've had hard words towards my wife or towards my husband I gave up on God upon you what am I saying to you that Jesus defeated death it's a sign of the spiritual but he keeps buzzing around me I got these things I got these things that I can't overcome my own that dude that's buzzing around you I want you to remind him he ain't got a stinger because the greatest punch that Satan has is death every demon in all of him is underneath the death depression is Underneath Him anxiety is underneath of him oppression and sin and cancer and every TB and every disease is underneath a death so that when Jesus defeated death two thousand years ago every demon is underneath the feet of the pride of Jesus Christ and the God of Peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly every devil is under the feet of the body of Jesus Christ if I was you I'd have myself a dancing party David it's time to wake dance on top of this devil taken back and back everything oh come on now oh Goliath he stood so tall but little David he was all so small but David said the battle's not mine The Battle Belongs to the Lords and as long as you know that you are fighting against an enemy that does not have a stinger you're fighting against an enemy that cannot win let him lie let him whisper let him tell all kinds of things it ain't nothing but a bluff but brother Branham said that you're made out of stuff that does not Bluff he said that's what flowed down from Calvary come on somebody let's praise the Lord [Music] [Applause] imagine hell this morning I don't know about y'all but something is going on up there in the region of Virginia laughs it was somebody that began to tap into another sphere and there was a guy out there that we tried to stop all week long from preaching this Army but somehow in the world the message got through we tried and we tried and we tried to war with him and we tried we tried to war against the children we tried
