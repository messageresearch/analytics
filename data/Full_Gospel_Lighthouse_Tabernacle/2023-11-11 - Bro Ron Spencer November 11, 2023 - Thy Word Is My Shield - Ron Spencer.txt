James chapter 3 and verse one interesting place to start are you are you there James chapter 3 and verse one my bre be not many Masters knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation for in many things that we offend all If any man offend not in word the same as a perfect man and able also to Bridal the whole body behold we put bits in horses mouths that they may obey us and we turn about their whole body behold also ships which through they be so great and are driven of fous winds yet they are turned about with a very small hym withs soever the governor listed now he's going to talk about us even so the tongue is a little member boasteth great things behold how a great a matter a little fire kindleth isin't it amazing in two minutes you can destroy an entire day and the tongue is a fire a world of iniquity so is the tongue among our members that it defileth the whole body and sth on fire the course of Nature and is set on the fire of hell for every kind of Beast and a bird and of serpents and of the things of the sea is tamed and hath been tamed of mankind but the tongue can no man tame it is an unruly evil you talking brother Ron we're Christians here yep I'm reading it to the right crowd it is an unruly evil full of deadly poison therewith bless we God even father and therewith curse ye men which are made after the similitude of God out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing my brethren these things ought not to be so to be do a fountain send forth the same Sweet Water and bitter can the fig tree my brethren bear Olive berries either of Vine or figs so can no Fountain both yield salt water and fresh God help us all tonight amen let's pray Lord Jesus we love you tonight it's good to be in your house a Saturday evening to serve the Lord and Lord as we come we draw closer to you we love you we feel your presence already so good to see one another we're going to spend eternity and Lord I just ask you that you would anoint us in a special way we pray Lord touch the needs of our people bless the visitors that are here with us tonight Lord may they feel the kindred spirit we want to spend heaven with you minister to us in a special way we pray in Jesus Christ's name you may be seated amen such a powerful scripture puts us all on the same page like that don't you Hallelujah W you just point to your mouth right there we all have one amen I'm glad you can read a scripture and everybody says yep he's talking about me now I want you to understand tonight when we talk about Thy Word Is Thy Thy word is my shield the power of life and death is in our tongue amen the most Supernatural thing about you it's not your hands it's not your feet is that right there because it can speak it can speak an atmosphere it can speak an atmosphere you say brother R I don't know so much about that just start worshiping God and you'll bring him on the scene just tell your wife how ugly she looks this morning I I just proved a point here didn't I now now let me just say this to you when his words go across our lips they're are not the they're not the words of the president they're not the words of some great poet they're the words of God and the words of God create an atmosphere and create they actually create something in our lives character inside of our Liv lives notice the scripture and there's going to be a lot of scriptures tonight Isaiah 40: 29 he giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might he increases strength even so the youth that shall faint and be weary and the young men shall utterly fall but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up on wings as an eagle they shall run and not not be weary they shall walk and not faint brother Ram talks to us about that realm of of Heaven he said it'll take perfect love to get there well you must remember this is the place where we develop that kind of a character first in John Chapter 13 and verse 34 a new commandment I give to you that you love one another as I have loved you that ye also love one another John 13 and verse 35 by this all men know that ye are my disciples if you have love one to another 15 and 12 this is my commandment that you love one another as I have loved you 15 and 17 these things I command you that you love one another notice the thing Romans 12 and verse 10 be kindly affection one to another with Brotherly Love in honor preferring one another Romans 13 and8 owe no man anything but to love one another for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law Galatians chap chap 5 and verse 13 for Brethren you have not you have been called unto Liberty which is freedom only use not Liberty for an occasion to the flesh but by love serve one another hundreds of scriptures I could have read to you but you get the them if you can't love one another you can't go to heaven Hallelujah if you can't love one another you can't go to heaven amen will you say brother Ron I don't like this one and I don't like that well you can't go to Heaven by your own testimony you can't go to heaven well I don't like this person I don't like that person let me give you an example here Jesus hanging on the cross Jesus hanging on a cross he had been beaten with the cat of nine tells his organs was hanging out he has carried the cross in the morning we'll talk more about that he even embraced the cross he kissed the greatest last trial of his life Trials come along in our lives to develop us and to make us better not to have whiny pity parties about are you with me now but to get us closer to God this is the only place he can develop us amen you're only mortal once you came from God you're going to go back to God you were in his mind but this is a place that you are developed how many of you had a test and you failed yeah every one of your hands should have went up here well let me just give you a perfect guarantee it's going to come again well I didn't like the trial let me just say this to you when Andrew set me down the first week of my diagnosis he said dad what do we want to accomplish in this trial one of the things I said I want to be sweeter I didn't mean diabetes but let me just say this you if you go through a trial and do not become a better Christian you miss the point father forgive them for they know not what they do now let me just say this to you we must understand that he was in Two Worlds at the same time he was looking at the Eternal purpose of God they did not know Calvary was saving me and you they did not realize when they whipped him he was going to fulfill Isaiah 53 let me just say this to you even as Israel is at War tonight don't get on the wrong side of that war don't go feel s sorry for the Palestinians and all the Arab Nations that war has been going on since Abraham has been here well brother Ron this many is being killed today let let me just give you a little preface here God killed 85,000 in one day he destroyed the whole world with a flood but he watches over his elect don't let politics blur your mind here those Jews are God's chosen people they're not going to lose so don't get on the wrong side there are you with me now they're not going to lose now I'm going to bring it to this you're not going to lose why'd you say that brother Ron listen your adversary will do a lot of things to you it'll cause it'll cause a lot of wars in your life keep your focus on who you are look over at your neighbor tell them keep your focus on who you are I want you to say this this scripture with me Isaiah 54 and verse1 17 thank you sister Stephanie you guys are like my daughters Stephanie and Crystal they came in when they were just pups they call Connie affectionately Mama Connie I don't know what they call me maybe Pops I'm going to work you hard tonight I'm sorry no weapon yeah I want you to say it no weapon no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment Thou shalt condemn amen what does that mean brother Ron you can look at the Devil and say you did this to me and God's going to use you to be a testimony against the devil cuz God is a good just God and he's got to have a witness against cancer and I'm going to stand there and tell him you did this to me hallelujah hallelujah Revelations 12 and verse 11 and they overcame him let's read it together and they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb we all know where that comes from and by the word of Ron Spencer's testimony read your name right there and by the word and they love not their lives unto death Hallelujah 1 Corinthians 16 and verse 13 sorry Steph here we go watch ye Stand Fast in the faith quit you like men be strong Matthew 6 and verse 33 but seek ye first the kingdom of God Amen put your priorities right seek ye first the kingdom of God listen if God's first you can't fail if your priorities gets in another order let me just say this you seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all of these things shall be added unto you now remember this God's words are Eternal they're they're not time sensitive they are Eternal God never has a new thought God is never in a crisis God is never in a position to where he wants to change his mind and say well you know it work 2,000 years ago but you know today I've got to change it so it will work no no no as a matter of fact it is not even H God don't have a word for South Africa and a word for Virginia God's word goes through every culture every man black white yellow when we face when we Face our when we Face the Demons of Hell the scriptures become our Warfare against him not our thoughts not our emotions not our opinions well brother Ron I got mad let me just say you listen the devil will spit on you to make you mad remember when brother Brandon was standing there that day and that that man who had whipped a lot of preachers came up and said this day I'll I I'll kill you and that begin to make all kind of boast that man spit in brother brandom's face and let me just say he was trying to get brother brandom the boxer to show up but he met the God that was inside of Willam Brandon are you with me let me just say this don't take your human element thinking you're going to whip the devil say that with me don't take your human element thinking you're going to whip the devil we we wage war against the enemy but we don't do it with our human flesh we bind that we loose by the authority of the name of the Lord Jesus Christ not the authority of our name but the authority and we're commissioned we're commissioned whether you're a little bitty tiny woman are you a great big man we're commissioned to use the authority of the name of the Lord Jesus Christ when you bind him you stop him in his heels so let me just say this to you stop complaining stop having your personal pity party stop getting in your cave like even Elijah did I could take you through all the scriptures Moses got a temper Elijah was Moody but they didn't defeat the Devil with their moodiness or their temper oh brother brother R I've got this excuse stop using your excuse stop using your excuse I'm going to use that tomorrow stop using your excuse try to defeat the Devil your excuses were sent along in your life for you to overcome your excuses was sent along in your life for you to overcome now turn around and say I refuse and I learned this from Kim Boer I refuse to give Satan voice I ref brother Ken Boer came here and spoke a sermon called slaying Giants at that point he had a a tumor that was in his brain he told me that he had a tumor in his brain they had had a wreck on a four-wheeler he had died in the accident Wayne lost prayed for him and he came back to life and when they when they examined brother Ken they found a a huge tumor in his brain he took the choice of not having any I'm not I'm not arguing with his choice he took the choice of not doing chemo or not doing anything to to get rid of it and I I talked to him literally just a few weeks before he died and he told me how Victorious he was and how good that he felt he was a testimony in that area but he said I refuse to give the enemy voice in my life let me just say this you no matter what your condition is don't exalt it above God Walk in Victory talk in Victory praise and victory I'd say this no matter how big your enemy is never give up I got a News Bulletin for you God answers prayer but brother Ron but you know a per that person died let me just say this you they may have died but they was not defeated sister sister Erica just passed away I'd say she was probably one of the most prayed forward people people in the entire Globe that's ever been because of social media sure she'd died but the cancer didn't win I may die before a morning but cancer will not win am I'll say it to you I said it at her funeral and it and it's been said by many people let me just say this to you if you hear I do don't believe it for a second I will be more alive there than I am here so many people sing about prayer they Dre they sing about death they dread death they all the time worried about when will my last day Spurgeon said this and I think it's pretty incredible never think about your last day God will take care of that on its own God numbers our days he knows when we're going to be here and when we're going to leave so let's leave that part up to God let me just say this you this tongue has the power of preaching of speaking positive or it has the power to speak negative let me just give you this for just a moment brother Thomas is in business many of you are in business we realize that when somebody when somebody can when some you do a job for somebody they can they can send out a negative response listen this was when I was in a chimney sweep business it started in ' 88 and and I read back then that that 48 people will respond negative while seven will respond positive you ever been around people that were just negative my hamburgers dry this ain't good every meal that they sat down at it ain't good it ain't good well if you was in Africa tonight you'd be thrilled to eat what you had in front of [Applause] you what do you do with people brother Ron you go out to eat with them and they start all the time negative about her food I never go out to eat with them again I don't like negativity around me I don't like gossip I don't like drama have you've been here long enough you know I don't like drama I don't like gossip most time gossip ain't right to start off with it's just where you're standing when you heard it I was sitting with the with a some preachers one night after a service and and they had took me out and they I I kind of felt like their intentions were when they took me out to eat they all sat on that side and I sat on this side I like this ain't good and they started talking about one of my friends one of my good friends let me just say this to you if I'm your friend I'm your friend and it's a real dangerous thing to talk about my friends and they started talking about my friend I let him go for a while I pull my phone out and I said Hey listen I know the real deal here I know the real story and you're operating on Gossip let me call my friend they all of a sudden had an itch to Lea so when you hear something of Gossip say hang on just a minute let me call the real guy hang on just a man I don't believe you got that exactly right take brother Ron's deal call a real guy give the Lord a good hand right [Applause] there now in this Mortal life is the only time that we can bring oursel under subjection to Christ it's our only time it's the only time that we could do it your character does not change on your way into rapture you are here what you're going to be somewhere else if you're a if you're a liar here you're going to be a liar there and most likely you ain't going there you're a bad guy here you know so many times you go to a funeral well he's better off well let me just say this to you not everybody's better off it's not a time to be real truthful there and stand there you're right you're right they better off all right well sometimes God bless you will will work out real well telling a family member they went right straight to hell not a good thing for you to do the night's not going to be good you may think it but you bet come on amen so we're all live people here reach over and tell your neighbor are you live so here we are what we are in this life is what we're going to be somewhere else now there's many great leaders that have come and gone that would not allow themselves to be molded by the hand of God there was a basketball coach that just died this week and I'm going to use it he died this week and he's reaping his reward whatever it was he was uh he was a champion he was a champion basketball coach he he coached a perfect team he he coached them to be totally undefeated he coached Mike Shashi who was the all-time great he he had a lot of people that played for him but he said I did it my way that was constantly his thing I did it my way now he may have been a phenomenal coach on but he was not a man that would allow himself to be developed in his character are you with me are you with me he threw chairs he choked men he grabbed them he rled him he cussed a lot of people come on as a matter of fact he said many disparaging things to many people you want that to be on your record and make god with well brother Ron you're picking on a basketball coach well let's talk about Napoleon brother man said he conquered the world he conquered the world but he couldn't overcome himself right so don't don't conquer the world and can't
