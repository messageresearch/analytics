[51:53] you to follow along with me and it came
[51:56] to pass for a long time that after the
[51:58] lord had given rest unto israel from all
[52:01] their enemies round about
[52:03] that joshua waxed old and was stricken
[52:06] in age
[52:07] and joshua called for all the children
[52:09] and for their elders and for their heads
[52:11] and for their judges and for their
[52:13] officers and said unto them i'm old and
[52:15] stricken in age
[52:18] and ye have seen all the lord your god
[52:20] hath done unto all of these nations
[52:23] before you
[52:25] for the lord your god is
[52:27] is he that hath fought for you i like
[52:31] that
[52:32] behold i have divided unto you for a lot
[52:36] except by lot
[52:38] these nations that remain to be an
[52:41] inheritance for your tribes
[52:44] from jordan with all the nations that i
[52:47] have cut off even the great sea westward
[52:51] for the lord your god he shall expel
[52:55] them from before you and drive them from
[52:58] out of your sight
[53:00] and ye shall possess
[53:02] the air land i like that word air land
[53:07] as the lord your god hath promised unto
[53:10] you
[53:10] be you therefore very courageous to keep
[53:14] and do all that is written in the book
[53:16] of the law of moses
[53:18] and and ye turn not
[53:20] aside
[53:22] they're from to the right
[53:25] hand
[53:27] or to the left
[53:29] i don't want to look left i don't want
[53:30] to look right i want to keep going on
[53:33] you may be seated and keep your work
[53:35] your scriptures handy just now
[53:40] that you come not among these nations
[53:44] these that remain among you neither make
[53:47] mention
[53:48] the name of their gods
[53:51] nor cause to swear by them
[53:53] neither serve them nor bow yourselves
[53:56] unto them
[53:58] but cleave
[53:59] unto the lord your god
[54:02] as ye have done until this day
[54:05] for the lord had driven out from before
[54:08] you great nations and strong but as for
[54:11] you
[54:12] no man hath been able to stand before
[54:14] you until this day
[54:17] one man shall chase a thousand
[54:20] for the lord your god
[54:22] he is it that fighteth for you as the
[54:25] lord hath promised
[54:27] take heed take good heed therefore unto
[54:30] yourselves that you love the lord your
[54:34] god
[54:35] as a reminder you know who you are you
[54:38] know where you're standing god is with
[54:41] you
[54:44] one man shall chase a thousand and let
[54:46] me just make mention of it three men
[54:49] we went got david a drink of water
[54:53] one man killed 800.
[54:55] samson
[54:59] shamgar
[55:02] one man
[55:04] listen a sermon is more than a sermon
[55:06] when it's put into action
[55:10] joshua 24 and verse 14 now therefore
[55:13] fear the lord and serve him in sincerity
[55:16] and in truth put away the gods which
[55:18] your father served on the other side of
[55:21] the flood and in egypt and serve you the
[55:24] lord anything that comes between you and
[55:27] god get it out of your circle
[55:32] and if it seems evil unto you to serve
[55:34] the lord choose you this day whom you
[55:37] will serve
[55:38] whether the gods which were your fathers
[55:41] served that were on the other side of
[55:43] the flood or the gods of the amorites in
[55:46] whose land you dwell but it's for me in
[55:48] my house i want you to say it with me as
[55:51] for me and my house
[55:53] we will serve the lord
[55:55] and the people answered and said god
[55:57] forbid that we should forsake the lord
[56:00] to serve other gods for the lord our god
[56:03] he it is that brought us
[56:06] up and our fathers out of the land of
[56:08] egypt from the house of bondage which
[56:11] did these great
[56:13] signs in our sight and preserved us in
[56:17] all the way wherein we went and among
[56:20] all the people through whom we passed
[56:23] and the lord drave out from before us
[56:25] all the people and the amorites which
[56:27] dwelt in the lands therefore
[56:30] will we also serve the lord for he is
[56:34] our god
[56:36] and joshua said unto the people you
[56:39] cannot serve the lord for he is and holy
[56:42] god he is a jealous god he will not
[56:45] forgive your transgressions nor your
[56:47] sins if you forsake the lord and serve
[56:50] strange gods then he will turn and do
[56:54] you hurt and consume you after that he
[56:57] hath done
[56:59] good you good and the people said unto
[57:02] joshua nay
[57:03] we will serve the lord and joshua said
[57:07] unto the people your witnesses against
[57:09] yourselves that ye have chosen the lord
[57:12] to serve him and they said we
[57:15] are witnesses
[57:20] jesus praised one of his last prayers
[57:23] when he was with his disciples
[57:25] and it's incredibly profound because
[57:27] you're a part of this
[57:29] in john chapter 17 and verse 1
[57:32] and these words spake jesus and lifted
[57:36] up his eyes to heaven and said
[57:38] father the hour is come
[57:42] glorify thy son that thy son also may
[57:46] glorify thee
[57:49] and and as thou has given him power over
[57:53] all flesh that he should give eternal
[57:56] life to as many as thou has given him
[58:00] and this is life eternal that they might
[58:04] know thee the only true god
[58:08] jesus christ whom thou hast sent
[58:11] notice these words this is a
[58:13] conversation between jesus
[58:15] and god and he said i have glorified
[58:18] thee on the earth
[58:20] i have finished the work which thou has
[58:22] gave us me to do
[58:26] now notice now he's going to pray for
[58:28] you
[58:30] and now i am verse 11 and now i am no
[58:32] more in the world but these are in the
[58:34] world and i have come to them holy
[58:37] father keep through thine own name
[58:40] those who thou has given me
[58:44] he's praying for god to keep you
[58:48] that they may be one
[58:50] even as we are one
[58:52] while i was with them in the world i
[58:54] kept them in the name
[58:56] those that thou gavest me i have kept
[58:59] and none of them has lost but the son of
[59:01] perdition
[59:03] that the scripture might be fulfilled
[59:06] i love that part
[59:08] because god don't lose you
[59:11] and now i come to thee and these things
[59:13] i speak in the world that they may have
[59:16] my joy fulfilled in themselves
[59:18] i have given them thy word and the world
[59:22] hateth them because they are not of the
[59:24] world even as i'm not of the world
[59:28] i pray not that thou should us take them
[59:30] out of the world but that thou should
[59:33] has keep them from evil
[59:35] you still got a job to do
[59:39] god don't need to take you home at this
[59:41] point
[59:42] you still got a purpose in your life
[59:46] they are not of the world even as i am
[59:48] not of the world sanctify them through
[59:50] thy truth that thy word is truth as i
[59:53] have sent them into the world even so
[59:56] have i also sent them into the world for
[1:00:00] their sakes i sanctify myself that they
[1:00:02] might be sanctified through the truth
[1:00:06] neither pray i for these alone but for
[1:00:09] them also
[1:00:13] which shall believe on me through their
[1:00:15] word
[1:00:18] jesus
[1:00:19] personally prayed for you
[1:00:25] that they may be one even as thou father
[1:00:28] art in me and i indeed that they
[1:00:32] also may be one in us
[1:00:34] that the world may believe that thou has
[1:00:37] sent me and the glory which thou gaveth
[1:00:40] me i have given them that they may be
[1:00:43] one even as we are one
[1:00:46] i in them and thou are in me
[1:00:49] that they may be made perfect in one
[1:00:53] that the world may know that thou has
[1:00:56] sent me and has lavished them and thou
[1:01:00] hast lovest me
[1:01:04] paul would say it like this brethren i
[1:01:06] count not myself philippians 3 and 13.
[1:01:10] brethren i count not myself too
[1:01:12] apprehended but this one thing that i do
[1:01:15] forgetting those things which are behind
[1:01:19] that's an incredible thing for you to do
[1:01:22] is
[1:01:23] your past is your past
[1:01:28] your past is your past quit letting your
[1:01:31] past beat you around
[1:01:35] you're not even that man anymore
[1:01:38] the blood of jesus christ sanctified you
[1:01:42] from all of those things and he washed
[1:01:44] you
[1:01:45] he purged you it's not even in your book
[1:01:48] anymore
[1:01:51] forgetting those things which are behind
[1:01:53] reaching forth to those things which are
[1:01:55] before i press towards the mark of the
[1:01:59] of the prize of the high calling of god
[1:02:03] in christ
[1:02:04] jesus
[1:02:08] hallelujah give the lord a good hand
[1:02:10] right now
[1:02:11] [Applause]
[1:02:12] [Music]
[1:02:16] i need to
[1:02:21] [Applause]
[1:02:22] brother branham says it like this he
[1:02:24] says
[1:02:25] then adam had to race up
[1:02:29] and he said will i do as my wife said
[1:02:33] do or shall i do what god said do
[1:02:36] and he walked out with his eyes open
[1:02:39] and he had to take responsibility
[1:02:44] sometimes you just got to take
[1:02:45] responsibility
[1:02:47] and if you need a theme this morning i'm
[1:02:49] going to preach to you on man up
[1:02:52] yes
[1:02:54] hallelujah
[1:02:55] he says
[1:02:57] he had to take responsibility that
[1:02:59] throwed the whole human race unto death
[1:03:03] he said then there cometh that other
[1:03:06] adam
[1:03:07] which was christ
[1:03:09] never one like him
[1:03:11] somebody could say that he wasn't god
[1:03:14] his uniqueness
[1:03:16] proved he was god
[1:03:19] there never was a creature
[1:03:21] like
[1:03:22] him lived like him he lived in the world
[1:03:26] to himself he was born outside of the
[1:03:29] realm of
[1:03:30] natural a sinful man he was the creator
[1:03:35] himself
[1:03:37] made flesh
[1:03:40] who could ever stood stand where he
[1:03:42] stood whoever talked like him whoever
[1:03:46] say the things that he could say
[1:03:49] who could ever do things that he done
[1:03:52] his uniqueness
[1:03:55] proved he was god
[1:03:58] what about your uniqueness
[1:04:03] what about your uniqueness today
[1:04:06] you live in the world but you're not of
[1:04:08] the world
[1:04:10] this message has washed you it's
[1:04:14] cleansed you
[1:04:16] not patched you up it made you anew
[1:04:19] you're a new creature in jesus christ
[1:04:22] your uniqueness tells you you came from
[1:04:26] god and you're going back to god
[1:04:30] [Applause]
[1:04:40] there wasn't a prophet or nothing else
[1:04:42] could do what he had done
[1:04:46] who could call the dead back from the
[1:04:47] grave
[1:04:50] who could stop the skies
[1:04:52] and do anything that
[1:04:55] he was to do
[1:04:58] who could do that
[1:05:02] only god could do that
[1:05:04] only god could do that
[1:05:06] that could calm the sea
[1:05:10] tell a storm to go back
[1:05:13] who could ever stand in this place
[1:05:16] who
[1:05:17] what could he
[1:05:19] be but that perfect immortal god made
[1:05:24] flesh and dwelt among us
[1:05:28] nothing ever compared to him
[1:05:31] he lived in a world to himself
[1:05:34] no one one no man ever spake like him
[1:05:40] when he just opened his mouth
[1:05:42] there was something about it
[1:05:45] that was different than anybody else
[1:05:48] are you hearing these statements back to
[1:05:50] back right here and you find that you're
[1:05:53] you're relating to this
[1:05:58] are you finding you're relating to this
[1:06:01] this world is not our home
[1:06:05] i'm not comfortable with what i see in
[1:06:07] the headlines of fox news and cnn news
[1:06:10] i'm not comfortable with what's going on
[1:06:12] in this world so it tells me i'm from
[1:06:15] another place
[1:06:17] but while i'm here i'm going to conduct
[1:06:20] myself as a son of god i'm going to
[1:06:22] stand i'm going to man up
[1:06:27] i'm going to man up and i'm going to
[1:06:28] take my position
[1:06:41] nothing ever compared to him
[1:06:44] he lived in a world to himself
[1:06:47] no man ever spake like him
[1:06:50] when he opened his mouth there was
[1:06:51] something about it
[1:06:53] it was different than anybody else
[1:06:56] somebody said he was just an ordinary
[1:06:58] man he said i defied that
[1:07:03] he was god
[1:07:05] and that
[1:07:06] what he was
[1:07:08] for no man ever spake like him no man
[1:07:12] ever could speak like him because he was
[1:07:14] the living word itself made flesh the
[1:07:18] manifestation of the fullness of
[1:07:26] god when brethren comes to the rapture
[1:07:29] which you and i are
[1:07:31] preparing to step into
[1:07:34] if you can't see it coming you got your
[1:07:36] head in the sand
[1:07:38] and he read this scripture
[1:07:40] and i want to read it for you again and
[1:07:41] i wanted to charge your humanity
[1:07:44] the lord is my light and my salvation
[1:07:47] psalms 27 and 1
[1:07:49] whom shall i fear
[1:07:51] the lord is the strength of my life of
[1:07:54] whom shall i be afraid when the wicked
[1:07:57] even mine enemies and my foes came upon
[1:07:59] me to eat my flesh they stumbled and
[1:08:01] fell though a host shouldn't camp
[1:08:03] against me my heart shall not fear the
[1:08:06] war should rise against me and this will
[1:08:08] i be confident
[1:08:11] under pressure
[1:08:13] a man is what he is under pressure
[1:08:20] if you run into battle that tells you
[1:08:22] what you are
[1:08:25] if things become convenient and you run
[1:08:27] and forsake it tells you what you are
[1:08:30] but there's going to be somebody
[1:08:33] [Applause]
[1:08:34] come on there's going to be somebody
[1:08:36] that'll stand in the midst of the storms
[1:08:39] of life
[1:08:40] and stand like jesus stood
[1:08:46] [Applause]
[1:08:52] one thing that i have desired of the
[1:08:54] lord
[1:08:55] that will i see kept her that i may
[1:08:57] dwell in the house of the lord all the
[1:08:59] days of my life
[1:09:01] to behold the beauty of the lord and to
[1:09:03] inquire in his temple for in the time of
[1:09:07] trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion
[1:09:10] and the secret of his tabernacle shall
[1:09:12] he hide me and he shall set me up on a
[1:09:14] rock and not shall my head be lifted up
[1:09:16] about my enemies round about and
[1:09:18] therefore will i offer in these
[1:09:20] tabernacles sacrifices of joy i will
[1:09:23] sing yea i will sing praises unto the
[1:09:25] lord
[1:09:30] nobody sings like you sing
[1:09:37] because you are who you are
[1:09:43] you are a son and daughter of god so he
[1:09:45] hears your
[1:09:47] individual voice
[1:09:50] coming through the blood of jesus christ
[1:09:54] and heavy heaven is a it's a noisy place
[1:09:59] but he hears your voice
[1:10:03] your voice of praise in the midst of
[1:10:06] your scorns he still hears your worship
[1:10:17] hear o lord when i cry
[1:10:19] with my voice have mercy upon me and
[1:10:21] answer me
[1:10:23] when thou say to seek ye my face my
[1:10:25] heart said unto thee thy face lord will
[1:10:27] i seek
[1:10:28] how not thy face far from me put not thy
[1:10:31] servant away in anger for that has been
[1:10:33] my help leave me not neither forsake me
[1:10:36] oh god of my salvation
[1:10:38] when my mother and my father forsake me
[1:10:40] then the lord will take me up
[1:10:44] teach me thy way o lord and lead me in a
[1:10:46] plain path because of my enemies deliver
[1:10:49] me not over to the will of my enemies
[1:10:51] for false witnesses or risen up against
[1:10:53] me and shall breathe out cruelty i
[1:10:56] had fainted
[1:10:59] unless i had believed to see the
[1:11:00] goodness of the lord in the land of the
[1:11:03] living wait on the lord
[1:11:07] and be of good courage and he shall
[1:11:09] strengthen thine heart wait i say on the
[1:11:14] lord
[1:11:18] jesus is preaching in luke chapter 17 it
[1:11:20] will be luke 17 but jesus is preaching
[1:11:25] verse 34
[1:11:28] now he's describing the rapture the con
[1:11:31] the circumstances the conditions of the
[1:11:33] rapture
[1:11:35] he says i tell you
[1:11:38] in that night
[1:11:40] there shall be two in one bed two men in
[1:11:43] one bed don't take that the wrong way
[1:11:49] and one shall be taken
[1:11:51] and the other shall be left
[1:11:55] two women shall be grinded together the
[1:11:57] one shall be taken
[1:11:59] and the other left
[1:12:02] two men in the field
[1:12:04] the one shall be taken and the other
[1:12:06] left
[1:12:10] and they answered and said in him a word
[1:12:11] lord
[1:12:13] and he said whether so ever the body is
[1:12:16] feather with the eagles be gathered
[1:12:18] together
[1:12:19] i just want to remind you at this point
[1:12:22] this is a personal rapture
[1:12:27] this is a personal rapture
[1:12:29] it's you and god
[1:12:31] it's going to be universal rapture
[1:12:34] but it's going to be you and god
[1:12:37] in your community in your homes middle
[1:12:39] doubt a lot of places
[1:12:42] want to be taken
[1:12:48] don't get your eyes on nobody but jesus

[1:13:23] in their life but conviction hits them
[1:13:25] and they'll they'll pull on you and pull
[1:13:28] on you for a rescue
[1:13:30] jesus is the only one that can rescue
[1:13:33] you
[1:13:34] the answer is not getting in a
[1:13:36] preacher's office and getting a thousand
[1:13:38] questions answered the answer is you
[1:13:40] having a personal revival
[1:13:42] in your life
[1:13:49] [Applause]

[1:19:00] me
[1:19:02] brother branham said that he did that
[1:19:05] to send the unbeliever away
[1:19:27] commitment takes the lazy people out of
[1:19:30] the equation

[1:19:36] motivational speech if you want to
[1:19:41] there's a lot of people that's talented
[1:19:45] but they're not committed

[1:22:00] i'll leave
[1:22:01] we'll take a picture
[1:22:05] i told a group to take a picture a few
[1:22:07] years ago look where they're at
[1:22:13] brother on you're just way out of line
[1:22:14] am i really
[1:22:17] god told gideon to get an army ready
[1:22:20] thousands of people came out said we're
[1:22:22] willing to fight
[1:22:24] and gideon god just told him said
[1:22:26] there's too many of them
[1:22:29] too many of them
[1:22:32] tell them that those that want to go
[1:22:33] back home
[1:22:35] that really don't want to fight just
[1:22:36] going back home
[1:22:38] do you know that most of the
[1:22:40] congregation left
[1:22:44] he told him again there's too many of
[1:22:46] you
[1:22:47] so he took them down by a brook
[1:22:50] and he asked them to drink water drink
[1:22:52] water from the brook
[1:22:55] and those
[1:22:58] that drank it in a certain way god would
[1:23:00] use those people don't you tell me god
[1:23:04] don't need 52 000 people to fight he
[1:23:06] needs one man in his head
[1:23:09] and god sent a one-man invasion
[1:23:12] he sent a one-man invasion into egypt
[1:23:16] and turned it upside down
[1:23:20] [Applause]
[1:23:36] a lot of people are associated
[1:23:39] but they're not willing to pay the price
[1:23:54] associated
[1:23:56] and not willing to pay the price
[1:24:00] what do you mean brother ron well i'll
[1:24:02] come when i want to
[1:24:06] you know if i ain't got something going
[1:24:07] on i'll be at church
[1:24:10] now as long as i get my name call
[1:24:13] yeah you know i'd like to have my name
[1:24:14] go and i'd like to sing i'd like to sing
[1:24:17] and i you know now you know i
[1:24:20] you know now i i want to dress like i
[1:24:22] want to on monday
[1:24:26] but i want to identify with you now when
[1:24:28] the rapture happens
[1:24:30] you know when the flood happens i want
[1:24:32] to be real close to the boat
[1:24:49] man running from presence of god brother
[1:24:51] brown spent some time on shirking your
[1:24:53] responsibility
[1:24:58] and it's really easy to shirt things
[1:25:00] it's difficult
[1:25:02] there's parts of the word that's
[1:25:04] got gall in it
[1:25:06] it makes you sick but you still got to
[1:25:08] eat it
[1:25:10] so what you do is you come from
[1:25:11] different denominations and come into
[1:25:13] the bride and you got to be washed
[1:25:16] wash of those creeds and those dogmas
[1:25:18] you got to be watched
[1:25:20] maybe you come from the charismatic
[1:25:22] realm and they had incredible worship
[1:25:24] but our worship is different than their
[1:25:26] worship
[1:25:29] they can worship eating a hot dog
[1:25:32] they can worship having a coffee
[1:25:36] they can worship looking like jezebel
[1:25:43] the man ain't really the man of the
[1:25:45] house
[1:25:46] or he'd tell her dress rot
[1:25:52] sometimes you just got to man up and say
[1:25:55] that won't work
[1:25:56] [Applause]
[1:25:59] people get mad at pastors for preaching
[1:26:01] clothesline religion but it ought to be
[1:26:03] more than a pastor
[1:26:06] daddy's look at your daughters
[1:26:10] and say that doesn't represent christ
[1:26:18] cover up
[1:26:20] even muhammad ali told his daughters
[1:26:23] don't show them
[1:26:26] their treasures for your husband to see
[1:26:29] don't let the world if muhammad ali
[1:26:31] could say that
[1:26:34] you should not be offended
[1:26:36] [Applause]
[1:26:52] jesus carried the cross
[1:26:55] and carried us as far as he could
[1:26:58] but the load was too heavy
[1:27:00] because he was too weak
[1:27:02] and a man named simon serene stepped
[1:27:04] under it and stepped and helped carry
[1:27:06] the cross
[1:27:08] i would imagine those moments never left
[1:27:10] his life
[1:27:12] we have been asked to carry the cross as
[1:27:14] well
[1:27:16] and it's the moments that we have with
[1:27:18] his presence that never listen the
[1:27:21] presence of god sometimes will leave you
[1:27:24] and you'll stand alone and you'll have
[1:27:25] to make decisions alone but you have
[1:27:28] been trained for the battle
[1:27:41] there's a statement it's a good
[1:27:42] statement
[1:27:44] the road to hell
[1:27:46] is paved
[1:27:49] with good intentions
[1:27:52] [Music]
[1:28:00] uh
[1:28:14] did you get are you getting it so far
[1:28:18] you getting this so far
[1:28:20] my chest is hurting really bad so i'm
[1:28:22] getting it too so
[1:28:24] i invited him to church
[1:28:27] he's whipped
[1:28:37] sometimes we say well it's my family
[1:28:42] and reason i'm taking my time right here
[1:28:44] because
[1:28:45] here's an excuse that we make
[1:28:47] but it's my family
[1:28:54] if you miss the rapture
[1:28:58] if you miss the rapture
[1:29:00] because of your family
[1:29:04] you're going to find it wasn't a good
[1:29:06] excuse

[1:40:04] and that's just the bare facts
[1:40:07] people with good jobs have just lost
[1:40:09] their jobs today
[1:40:11] and they lost everything that they had
[1:40:13] their little knick-knacks that are
[1:40:14] treasures that they had in afghanistan
[1:40:17] they they've got to leave them
[1:40:20] to live
[1:40:22] now you think i'm way out right here
[1:40:25] just now but i want to tell you this
[1:40:27] it's these kind of sermons
[1:40:30] that are telling you the rapture's
[1:40:31] happening
[1:40:38] are you with me
[1:40:39] and it's more than just one morning
[1:40:41] you're gonna wake up it's already in
[1:40:43] progress
[1:40:45] the bride around the world has been
[1:40:47] listening to these messages for years
[1:40:49] and it's preparing her one step at a
[1:40:51] time the script has been placed on the
[1:40:54] inside of her and she's living the life
[1:40:57] brother man said we are invited to shape
[1:40:59] our character to his character
[1:41:04] and you're going to leave everything of
[1:41:06] this world behind
[1:41:08] all your collectibles all your money all
[1:41:11] your iras it's going to do you no good
[1:41:14] but we don't need it where we're going
[1:41:20] [Applause]
[1:41:28] lord
[1:41:29] there's another way i can drive that
[1:41:31] point
[1:41:32] fire starts happening at your house
[1:41:35] you can't get all your collectibles and
[1:41:37] run you got to run for your life
[1:41:41] this world's on fire
[1:41:45] this world's shaken apart
[1:41:49] and i want to ask you at this point
[1:41:54] what's really important to you
[1:42:04] teddy roosevelt gave a speech
[1:42:07] the man in the arena
[1:42:10] and he said it's not the critic that
[1:42:12] counts
[1:42:14] i want to elaborate on that point just
[1:42:16] for
[1:42:16] just a little bit here
[1:42:20] if you're paying attention to your
[1:42:22] critic
[1:42:26] you forgot what's important to you
[1:42:31] because remember you and your critic
[1:42:34] are headed in two different directions
[1:42:41] brother on i'm not getting it
[1:42:43] well this cancer devil that i have been
[1:42:45] fighting for a year and a half we're
[1:42:47] headed in two different directions
[1:42:50] he's headed back to hell and i'm headed
[1:42:52] to heaven
[1:42:54] [Applause]
[1:43:09] this might be disappointing to you
[1:43:11] but people that send me nonsense
[1:43:14] tell me all different kind of things
[1:43:16] that
[1:43:18] i paid literally this much attention to
[1:43:20] them
[1:43:22] because they're headed where that cancer
[1:43:24] devil's headed
[1:43:30] make a movie about me
[1:43:32] don't bother me
[1:43:34] make a blog about me
[1:43:36] don't bother me
[1:43:42] so if you are paying attention to your
[1:43:45] critic
[1:43:47] do what brother ron does
[1:43:49] turn them off
[1:43:54] [Applause]
[1:44:09] can i give you a few quotes here
[1:44:12] the holy spirit is deity
[1:44:16] god tabernacled in a man
[1:44:19] think about that
[1:44:21] god
[1:44:23] tabernacled
[1:44:24] in a man
[1:44:27] god's not going to tabernacle in this
[1:44:28] pulpit
[1:44:30] or in these lights
[1:44:32] he wants to live in you
[1:44:35] sister ruthie wants to live in you
[1:44:39] he wants to live in you
[1:44:42] he wants to look out that window that
[1:44:44] you've got sister gabrielle that you saw
[1:44:47] jesus standing there looking out he
[1:44:49] wants to use your body to look out
[1:44:56] and in case you're wondering i'm
[1:44:58] watching that little fella and i'm going
[1:45:00] to break church order one of these
[1:45:02] nights and when he runs out i'm going
[1:45:04] with him
[1:45:15] i'm funny if you get to know me
[1:45:19] it's more than a sensation
[1:45:23] it's more than speaking to tongues
[1:45:25] it's more than shouting in the spirit
[1:45:27] it's more than weeping
[1:45:28] it's more than joining a church it's god
[1:45:31] living in a man
[1:45:33] deity god himself tabernacled in that
[1:45:36] person when he can speak it's just the
[1:45:38] same as god speaking
[1:45:41] that's the church of jesus christ that's
[1:45:44] the way that first apostolic church went
[1:45:47] forth
[1:45:50] another quote
[1:45:52] they deny
[1:45:54] the deity of jesus christ in this day
[1:45:58] that when people try to make jesus just
[1:46:00] a man
[1:46:03] why he was more than a man
[1:46:06] if he was just a man we're all lost
[1:46:09] he was god and nothing less than god
[1:46:13] he was god manifested in flesh jehovah
[1:46:16] the father dwelling in his son
[1:46:19] reconciling the world to himself
[1:46:30] are you with me now
[1:46:31] brother bam says there you are christ
[1:46:33] the mystery of god revealed there you
[1:46:35] are the body of christ living
[1:46:38] standing
[1:46:39] redeemed
[1:46:40] amen
[1:46:43] justified in his sight
[1:46:47] wow are we justified
[1:46:50] we
[1:46:51] are his victory
[1:46:57] the other day when sister karen's
[1:46:59] funeral took place
[1:47:03] many of you watched it but now henry's
[1:47:05] watched it by now her memorial service
[1:47:10] she was a queen on this earth
[1:47:14] and i felt commissioned to send her away
[1:47:16] as a queen
[1:47:19] and i felt commissioned to tell her well
[1:47:21] done you see she preached more sermons
[1:47:23] than brother tim preached
[1:47:27] her life
[1:47:28] her dress
[1:47:32] sisters whether you realize this or not
[1:47:34] you preach sermons from this pulpit
[1:47:37] uh are in walmart or on your jobs
[1:47:42] your atmosphere
[1:47:45] without saying a word
[1:47:50] you're working as a nurse
[1:47:52] people go something different about her
[1:47:55] may never say nothing to you but to go
[1:47:56] away if i was a christian i'd want to be
[1:47:58] like that working in a bank
[1:48:01] i'd like to be like her
[1:48:05] wherever you are when you conduct
[1:48:07] yourself as a lady
[1:48:09] these sermons live in your life
[1:48:17] come on church
[1:48:22] justified in his sight
[1:48:25] can i elaborate just a second here
[1:48:29] justification is as though you never did
[1:48:31] it in the first place
[1:48:35] in your memory you remember a lot of
[1:48:36] your faults and failures
[1:48:40] but when you're justified and god looks
[1:48:42] at it it's as though you never did it
[1:48:47] what a tremendous victory
[1:48:50] that it is that you can stand there and
[1:48:52] all of that be on satan's records
[1:48:55] and god can't even see it
[1:49:05] you know sister rachel sitting back
[1:49:07] there in the back
[1:49:09] maybe you on the internet's never met
[1:49:11] her
[1:49:12] but she was one of the roughest human
[1:49:14] beings
[1:49:16] you would not want to meet that little
[1:49:18] 120 pound woman in a dark alley if she
[1:49:22] was after your hide
[1:49:25] she was meaner brother kenny you're
[1:49:27] welcome to say amen at any point in this
[1:49:30] [Laughter]
[1:49:35] when you hear her scream
[1:49:38] when you hear her shout
[1:49:41] she's got a reason
[1:49:45] she got a license
[1:49:51] hallelujah
[1:49:57] brother ron i'd like for your church to
[1:49:58] be a little quieter well you got the
[1:50:00] wrong group
[1:50:03] we know what jesus has done in our lives
[1:50:07] [Applause]
[1:50:12] and we are the man in the arena
[1:50:16] we are the man in the arena
[1:50:21] jesus has come and met us in our circle
[1:50:24] [Applause]
[1:50:26] and we've been saved
[1:50:28] we've been filled
[1:50:30] we've been healed
[1:50:31] [Applause]
[1:50:33] and we got something to shout about
[1:50:39] i don't have to wait like this there i
[1:50:42] can start shouting right down here
[1:50:45] hallelujah
[1:50:47] i am committed
[1:50:50] i'm not going back i got nothing to go
[1:50:53] back to
[1:50:56] we're marching to zion
[1:50:59] [Applause]
[1:50:59] [Music]
[1:51:00] [Applause]
[1:51:10] i can't do your job for you but you've
[1:51:12] been built to do it
[1:51:14] you can't take nobody else's place
[1:51:18] but god designed you specifically to do
[1:51:20] it
[1:51:22] you're going to be the bible that most
[1:51:24] people read
[1:51:25] let it live
[1:51:32] as your musicians come
[1:51:34] just go ahead and put the dress on don't
[1:51:36] be ashamed of it
[1:51:40] where's carly
[1:51:42] carly the other day we got pictures of
[1:51:44] her twirling in her dress
[1:51:48] and she's just twirling
[1:51:50] the greatest day of her life
[1:51:52] she's just twirling in her in her dress
[1:51:56] and little miss ally
[1:51:58] she had a dress like her
[1:52:01] now she didn't have to wait till she got
[1:52:03] oh i feel like shouting right here
[1:52:05] she didn't have to wait till she got
[1:52:07] grown to twirl in her grace so she just
[1:52:09] started twirling
[1:52:11] [Applause]
[1:52:14] you may be young and you may be old
[1:52:18] you don't have to get to heaven to start
[1:52:19] twirling in your dress
[1:52:35] [Applause]
[1:52:39] coming to the church is the greatest
[1:52:40] thing in the world
[1:52:43] for a little part of this sermon we had
[1:52:44] to wash and scrub
[1:52:46] we got up under the possible and
[1:52:48] impossible
[1:52:49] and we scrubbed and we scrubbed we went
[1:52:51] down into our will of our humanity and
[1:52:53] we scrubbed and we scrubbed and
[1:52:57] we got to telling ourselves you're gonna
[1:52:58] have to do better
[1:53:00] and we're scrubbed and we're scrubbed
[1:53:01] and we're scrubbed
[1:53:03] and then we start putting on the dress
[1:53:07] cause if you live in a hog pin you
[1:53:09] better get washed up
[1:53:16] that's why your house ought to be clean
[1:53:20] because jesus could show up any day
[1:53:24] if your house ain't clean go home wash
[1:53:25] the dishes
[1:53:30] your bed ain't made make you better
[1:53:33] you need to vacuum the floor back in the

[1:55:26] [Music]

[1:55:30] and my knees are going to really work
[1:55:35] [Music]
[1:55:38] i'm sorry i didn't get done today but
[1:55:40] give me something for next week
[1:55:43] because we can say this
[1:55:45] i'm one of them
[1:55:48] i want you to tell your neighbor with a
[1:55:50] solid assurance i'm one of them
[1:56:00] and i'm one of them
[1:56:02] i'm one of them
[1:56:04] i'm one of them
[1:56:06] it's not no accidental rapture
[1:56:08] i know for sure
[1:56:11] it's not happening without me
[1:56:18] can i just share one more story with you
[1:56:20] when i was a little boy
[1:56:23] we lived in a mobile home it was a long
[1:56:25] mobile home it was about 70 foot long
[1:56:27] and
[1:56:28] mom and dad's bedroom was on that end
[1:56:32] and mine was on the complete opposite
[1:56:34] end
[1:56:35] not saying anything here he's going to
[1:56:36] be watching in a little bit and mom's
[1:56:38] across the room
[1:56:40] but you know sometimes their snores
[1:56:43] would get quiet
[1:56:46] and i couldn't hear them
[1:56:49] 70 feet away
[1:56:53] and so i'd slip up that hall
[1:56:57] because i believed the rapture so much i
[1:57:00] didn't want to miss it
[1:57:04] and i didn't turn on the light
[1:57:06] and i'd slip through
[1:57:09] and i would get close enough
[1:57:12] i could hear him
[1:57:17] you won't believe it but that was the
[1:57:18] greatest sound as a little boy
[1:57:21] it's great to hear your mama and daddy
[1:57:23] go
[1:57:30] cause the rapture hadn't happened yet
[1:57:34] [Applause]
[1:57:43] hallelujah
[1:57:46] hallelujah
[1:57:48] but one of these mornings you're gonna
[1:57:50] call me gone cause i'm gonna be leaving
[1:57:54] [Applause]
[1:58:04] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:58:08] and we don't want to leave one
[1:58:10] hoof
[1:58:12] behind
[1:58:15] grab your baby and say
[1:58:16] i'm going to do what i got to do but
[1:58:18] we're going to make it
[1:58:21] i'd like for you to say like joshua said
[1:58:23] as for me and my house
[1:58:31] i just want to remind you there's a burn
[1:58:33] ban that's on
[1:58:35] so if you decide to burn all your
[1:58:36] nonsense
[1:58:38] be careful when you do it
[1:58:40] call brother thomas he'll tell you when
[1:58:42] the burn ban won't be on and
[1:58:47] get you a shredder get you whatever you
[1:58:49] got to do get rid of whatever that's
[1:58:50] holding you back

[1:58:57] lord
