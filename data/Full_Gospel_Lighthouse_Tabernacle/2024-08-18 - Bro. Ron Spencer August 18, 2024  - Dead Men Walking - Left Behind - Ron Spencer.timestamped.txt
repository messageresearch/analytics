[51:06] if you will turn with me to Luke chapter
[51:08] 17 this
[51:14] morning Luke chapter
[51:18] 17 something that's been on my heart for
[51:20] a couple of months and I thought well I
[51:23] I don't know if I'll ever get to preach
[51:24] it but it's been on my heart and and it
[51:27] just keeps coming and keeps coming
[51:29] and and week and a half ago it just
[51:32] dropped solid in my heart and I said
[51:35] well I'm going to get to speak it today
[51:37] and so so here we are Luke chapter 17
[51:41] and verse
[51:42] 20 and when he was de demanded of the
[51:46] Pharisees when the kingdom of God should
[51:49] come he answered them and said the
[51:51] kingdom of God cometh not with
[51:54] observation
[51:56] neither shall they say Lo here or low
[51:59] there or behold the kingdom of God is
[52:01] within
[52:02] you and he said unto the disciples the
[52:06] days will come when you shall desire to
[52:08] see one of the days of the son of
[52:11] man and shall not see
[52:13] it and they shall say unto you see here
[52:18] or see there go not after them nor
[52:22] follow them for as a lightning that
[52:25] lightthe
[52:27] of the one part under Heaven shineth
[52:30] unto the other part under heaven so
[52:32] shall also the son of man be in his day
[52:37] but first must he suffer many things and
[52:40] be rejected of this
[52:42] generation and as it was in the days of
[52:45] Noah so shall it be also in the days of
[52:49] the son of man they did eat they drank
[52:54] they married wives they were given in
[52:56] marriage until the day that Noah entered
[52:59] into the ark and the flood came and
[53:03] destroyed them all and likewise also as
[53:07] it was in the days of lot they did eat
[53:11] and they bought and they sold and they
[53:14] planted and they build it but the same
[53:18] day that lot went out of Sodom it rained
[53:21] fire and brimstone from heaven and
[53:24] destroyed them all even thus shall it be
[53:27] in the day when the son of man is
[53:29] revealed and in that day he shall he
[53:33] which is shall be upon the Housetop and
[53:35] his stuff in the house let him not come
[53:38] down to take it away and he that is in
[53:41] the field let him likewise not return
[53:43] back this is a powerful scripture right
[53:46] now
[53:47] remember Lot's
[53:50] wife and whosoever shall seek to save
[53:53] his life shall lose it and who whosoever
[53:56] shall lose his life shall preserve it
[53:59] and I tell you that in that night there
[54:03] shall be two men in one bed and one
[54:05] shall be taken and the other shall be
[54:07] left and two men shall be grinding
[54:10] together and one shall be taken and the
[54:13] other
[54:14] left two women shall be grinded together
[54:18] the one shall be taken the other left
[54:20] two men shall be in the field the one
[54:22] shall be taken and the other left and
[54:25] they answered and said unto him where
[54:28] Lord and he said unto them wheresoever
[54:32] the body is thither will the Eagles be
[54:36] gathered together maybe you have a need
[54:38] on your heart this morning you just like
[54:40] say Lord would you just remember me
[54:42] today Heavenly Father we love you today
[54:45] with all of our hearts thank you for the
[54:48] desire to come to the house of the Lord
[54:50] and hear from your word now Lord we we
[54:53] have already felt your presence in so
[54:55] many ways
[54:57] we ask you now that you'd speak to our
[54:59] hearts and anoint the lips of a speaker
[55:01] for Lord there's no man that can take
[55:04] the word of life and deliver it in a way
[55:07] like you can now Lord I just pray that
[55:10] you would anoint it strengthen us give
[55:12] us strength for the for preaching of the
[55:14] word and Lord take the words and may it
[55:17] go to the hearers today minister to our
[55:20] hearts in a supernatural way we pray in
[55:24] Jesus Christ's name amen and amen amen
[55:27] amen God bless you you can be
[55:30] seated
[55:32] amen I would like to speak to you this
[55:35] morning and just take a thought and
[55:39] expand from that thought Dead Men
[55:43] Walking Dead Men Walking and for a
[55:46] subtitle I would like to take a thought
[55:49] on left
[55:51] behind this is something that none of us
[55:53] want to
[55:54] fulfill none of us want to
[55:57] fulfill the we as the Bride of Jesus
[56:00] Christ we have become we have become by
[56:03] the revelation of the word to realize
[56:05] that we're
[56:06] leaving we're leaving it's going to be
[56:10] in the moment and the twinkling of an
[56:11] eye it's a Rapture and that Rapture is
[56:14] going to take us from this world to
[56:16] another world we're going to get a
[56:18] change of our bodies and it's a
[56:20] Victorious time for the Bride of Jesus
[56:22] Christ we will see resurrected saints
[56:26] come back and moms and dads and uncles
[56:29] and we will see those that have went on
[56:31] before that has lived Victorious lives
[56:33] that were looking for the Rapture in
[56:35] their day but but now that they'll be
[56:39] coming back to us and oh what a reunion
[56:41] that's going to be and I can't wait to
[56:44] see my father can't wait to see brother
[56:46] Homer can't wait to hear him sing the
[56:49] songs of Glory again and the many of our
[56:52] loved ones that have went on before and
[56:55] to not just see them but see them in
[56:57] young
[56:59] bodies that's a statement within
[57:02] ourselves to see them young and not be
[57:05] fighting sickness or brother Homer with
[57:07] with one amputated leg or even brother
[57:11] that that was in a wheelchair for many
[57:13] years in his life and and to see him and
[57:15] young and in health and to know that now
[57:18] when that when that gear begins to
[57:21] happen we know that our homegoing is
[57:23] getting ready to happen
[57:26] we know once we see them that the next
[57:29] gear is for us to be going home and
[57:33] we're going home to the marriage supper
[57:35] of the lamb and we'll spend three and a
[57:37] half years and and you think about three
[57:39] and a half years that's that's also the
[57:41] time of the tribulation period it's also
[57:44] the time when Jesus was here on the
[57:46] earth and he spent three and a half
[57:47] years I was just sharing some things
[57:49] with brother William just a few moments
[57:51] ago and three and A2 years isn't very
[57:54] long I F I have fought cancer for over
[57:58] over three and a half years and and it
[58:00] just seems like yesterday that we
[58:02] started this battle but we begin to
[58:05] think the church World they've got their
[58:07] thoughts of rapture and in their
[58:09] thoughts of rapture because they did not
[58:11] hear the message of the hour they got
[58:14] thoughts of the coming of the Lord many
[58:16] of them believe that it will happen
[58:18] after the tribulation period can you
[58:20] imagine preaching to to a world to where
[58:24] that you're going to have to overcome
[58:26] the tribulation period amen and then
[58:29] we'll get a Rapture they talk about
[58:32] planes crashing and trains crashing
[58:35] hospitals being emptied cars going down
[58:38] the road without somebody driving it and
[58:41] people leaving the Earth and and but we
[58:44] know that Jesus is coming according to
[58:46] Revelations chapter 17 he's coming as a
[58:49] thief in the
[58:51] night and we realize that the reason
[58:54] that we have seen the message of the
[58:56] power that God blinded the eyes of the
[58:59] Gentiles but he opened your eyes now
[59:02] it's just not this church but its
[59:04] churches all over the world that heard
[59:06] the message of the
[59:09] hour and the message of the hour has
[59:12] prepared us amen for the wedding gown
[59:16] it's prepared us for our
[59:19] homegoing the thought that I would like
[59:21] to deliver to you this morning is we're
[59:24] going to leave
[59:27] we're going to leave and and for us it's
[59:29] a phenomenal day but somebody's going to
[59:34] stay why would you preach such a sermon
[59:37] that had this kind of darkness in it
[59:39] brother Ron I just want to say this to
[59:41] you there's still
[59:44] time there's still
[59:47] hope there's still hope for you get on
[59:51] [Music]
[59:53] board I was I was speaking
[59:56] I was speaking with brother Kim denal at
[59:59] at the at the meeting when we were in
[1:00:02] Canada the other day the first time that
[1:00:05] I ever went to Canada and and uh spoke
[1:00:09] there it' be about 94 95 year uh that
[1:00:12] would be and and we was out in a it was
[1:00:15] out in a building it was on a camp and
[1:00:17] brother King Kim dingwall was
[1:00:19] responsible uh of of of put putting
[1:00:22] together a theatrical performance and it
[1:00:25] was phenomenal that I had a front row
[1:00:28] seat and and brother Chad and his wife
[1:00:31] that have been here many times actually
[1:00:33] just wrote me this morning been here
[1:00:35] many times and it was a it was a
[1:00:37] phenomenal theme and that was a theme of
[1:00:41] who will you be Jesus
[1:00:44] toen and so in the light of that I I've
[1:00:46] I've thought of that so many times of I
[1:00:50] was at that setting and I was there and
[1:00:52] they put that play on it was a
[1:00:54] phenomenal and and and brother Kim had
[1:00:57] designed this the setting of the of the
[1:01:00] place and and he he had designed the
[1:01:02] theatrical stage and it had all kind of
[1:01:05] me Mechanicals and as I was standing
[1:01:07] there speaking with him he seemed like
[1:01:09] now we've both got a little gray in her
[1:01:11] hair and and and and he just shared with
[1:01:15] brother Andrew the first night that I
[1:01:17] spent there at his place and I I I I
[1:01:21] stayed in his home and he had a he had a
[1:01:23] set of drums and being a drummer as a as
[1:01:27] a young boy uh I uh I always have been
[1:01:31] attached to drums and so you know if you
[1:01:34] don't believe in Drums where you're
[1:01:35] probably not going to enjoy
[1:01:37] heaven and so and so the next morning
[1:01:41] you know everybody was doing their thing
[1:01:43] and kind maybe even asleep cuz I was on
[1:01:45] a different time zone and I went
[1:01:47] downstairs and and I got on those
[1:01:50] drums and brother Kim was sharing that
[1:01:53] he said I heard those drums being beat
[1:01:56] he said the last person I I thought that
[1:01:58] would be playing the drums was brother
[1:02:03] Ron
[1:02:05] Hallelujah you know he be to share with
[1:02:07] me and he said brother Ron he said I'm
[1:02:09] at a spot now that I feel like that I
[1:02:12] can just share the message with people
[1:02:14] and just talk to them and and just go up
[1:02:16] and talk to them he said they're so lost
[1:02:18] in their thoughts and he said but we
[1:02:21] have
[1:02:22] truth and and he began to give me one
[1:02:25] after another another and after another
[1:02:27] of talking to them about truth and and
[1:02:30] and things and their eyes becoming open
[1:02:33] and they just begin to talk and as he
[1:02:35] begin to talk this message just kept
[1:02:37] laying in my
[1:02:38] heart we are the final
[1:02:43] light we're the final light to a very
[1:02:45] dark age now we can see we can see the
[1:02:50] the message of the hour and how it's
[1:02:51] working I begin to think about what all
[1:02:54] God is doing so many many people are
[1:02:56] waiting for God to do something we're
[1:02:58] waiting for a supernatural move of God
[1:03:01] and so I thought I'd just write a couple
[1:03:03] things down we can see a lan of
[1:03:10] butts that was suffering deeply with
[1:03:13] cancer her lungs were dark and in one
[1:03:16] service when the pastor brother Tim PR
[1:03:19] is singing leaning on the Everlasting
[1:03:21] Arms of Jesus and she's just starts
[1:03:24] running around the building and the next
[1:03:27] day in an x-ray those lungs were
[1:03:31] clear we can see Mariah that that that's
[1:03:35] now married and she had lost all of her
[1:03:37] hair and and and she was she came to a
[1:03:40] meeting brother Tim had prayed for her
[1:03:42] months before and she was praying for
[1:03:44] the restoration of her hair and she came
[1:03:47] through the prayer line that we was
[1:03:48] being a part of and when she came
[1:03:50] through the prayer line she had three
[1:03:52] bobby

[1:04:11] restored to our position brother Tim PR

[1:07:08] happening in spite of our humanity and
[1:07:11] our faults and our failures God's got a
[1:07:14] bigger

[1:07:36] Bride of Jesus Christ stay in line get
[1:07:41] back in

[1:07:49] understand I was in a meeting with
[1:07:52] brother Tim PR in
[1:07:53] Florida and brother Tim is speaking and
[1:07:56] he comes to a Sunday morning and he
[1:07:58] asked the
[1:08:00] question is Mercy
[1:08:03] over and he said mercy
[1:08:07] no
[1:08:09] amen let me just say this to you while
[1:08:13] there is
[1:08:16] Mercy while there is Mercy I want you to
[1:08:19] pray for your prodal like never before
[1:08:25] we must realize that the mer day of
[1:08:27] Mercy will close for the Gentile
[1:08:31] generation understand this Noah had no
[1:08:36] control of shutting the door that's
[1:08:40] right Noah had no control over shutting
[1:08:44] the door I'm going to borrow brother
[1:08:46] Homer's Bible this
[1:08:48] morning hey brother homer I'm going do
[1:08:50] the best I
[1:08:52] can Noah had no control of shutting the
[1:08:56] door neither do
[1:09:01] we neither do we there's going to come a
[1:09:05] time that we're going to speak our last
[1:09:08] Saturday night
[1:09:10] service we're going to gather our last
[1:09:12] Sunday service for the last
[1:09:16] time we are seeing the signs we we're
[1:09:19] very we're very aware of the signs that
[1:09:21] are here not going to go there this
[1:09:23] morning but we are the only only
[1:09:25] continuation of the message brother
[1:09:28] brandom just didn't preach the message
[1:09:30] and leave it there there are men around
[1:09:32] the world under a five-fold Ministry
[1:09:35] that are preaching the message with
[1:09:37] everything that is within
[1:09:40] us I want to use my energies as much as
[1:09:43] I've got to preach this message with
[1:09:49] everything because we have the king's
[1:09:51] sword in our hands
[1:09:55] amen are you with me now now I want you
[1:09:58] to understand there came a time that
[1:10:01] Lazarus was dead no
[1:10:04] more but he had to die again can you
[1:10:07] imagine Legion that was walking in the
[1:10:10] tombs but there came a time after he met
[1:10:15] Jesus that he could go
[1:10:18] home that he was no longer a haunted
[1:10:21] house for everybody to be afraid of
[1:10:25] listen once you meet Jesus you're going
[1:10:27] to be
[1:10:28] changed you cannot meet him and ever be
[1:10:31] the
[1:10:33] same are you with me now in Mark chapter
[1:10:38] 10 and verse
[1:10:44] 17 and I I just want to share something
[1:10:46] with you before I read that scripture
[1:10:48] Spurgeon told us powerful
[1:10:51] story he told a story of a man that that
[1:10:55] moved under a very Scenic
[1:10:57] Place he moved at the bottom of a cliff
[1:11:00] that had a huge facial Stone Face on it
[1:11:06] and everybody knew that one day that
[1:11:08] that stone was going to
[1:11:10] fall it was huge it was absolutely huge
[1:11:14] that man moved there and people warned
[1:11:16] him they warned him over and over again
[1:11:19] that's going to fall one of these days
[1:11:20] and and he moved under it anyway it was
[1:11:23] beautiful it was scenic everybody loved
[1:11:26] the place but but after a while he
[1:11:29] become numb to the
[1:11:31] danger am had a wife she become numb to
[1:11:35] the danger you know after a couple
[1:11:38] Generations a 100 people are living
[1:11:40] under the
[1:11:41] Rock and after just a little while a
[1:11:43] thousand people are living under the
[1:11:46] Rock and before long America's living
[1:11:49] under the
[1:11:52] Rock and listen they know the danger
[1:11:55] that it's coming to an
[1:11:56] end and one day that rock face fell on
[1:12:01] that that that small group or that
[1:12:04] Township but they knew the
[1:12:08] danger so many people know the danger
[1:12:10] drunks on the street know the
[1:12:14] danger I was at the fair this week you
[1:12:16] can't imagine how many people walked up
[1:12:18] to me and said boy we're living in the
[1:12:20] end time we're coming to an end how
[1:12:23] horrible that looks and how what our
[1:12:25] situation is America is rotten
[1:12:29] now amen but the but listen we need more
[1:12:32] than just having a feeling that it's
[1:12:34] over with we got to do something about
[1:12:37] it you got to do something about it you
[1:12:40] got to get your right your life right
[1:12:42] with God you got to get the
[1:12:46] token I want to read to you somebody
[1:12:49] that that got real
[1:12:51] close in Revelation or Mark chap 10 vers
[1:12:55] 17 and when he was gone forth into the
[1:12:59] way there come one running and kneel to
[1:13:01] him and saying good
[1:13:03] Master what shall I do that I I may
[1:13:06] inherit eternal life what an incredible
[1:13:10] question and Jesus said unto him why
[1:13:12] callest thou me
[1:13:14] good there is none good but one that is
[1:13:19] God thou knowest the Commandments do not
[1:13:22] commit adultery do not kill do not steal
[1:13:25] do not bear false witness defraud not
[1:13:27] honor thy father and mother and he
[1:13:30] answered and said unto him master all
[1:13:33] these things have I observed from my
[1:13:37] youth and then Jesus beholding him loved
[1:13:41] him I always thought that so powerful
[1:13:44] Jesus loved him but it didn't save him
[1:13:48] oh come
[1:13:50] on think about this Jesus loved him
[1:13:55] yeah but it didn't save
[1:14:01] him and said unto him one thing that
[1:14:06] thou loest go thy way and sell
[1:14:09] whatsoever thou Hast and give to the
[1:14:12] poor that thou shalt have treasure in
[1:14:15] heaven and come take up the cross and
[1:14:18] follow me notice now and he was sad at
[1:14:22] that saying and went away grieved for he
[1:14:26] had great possessions and Jesus looked
[1:14:29] round about and saith unto his
[1:14:33] disciples how hardly shall they that
[1:14:37] have riches enter into the kingdom of
[1:14:43] God quite a statement most of us don't
[1:14:47] have that
[1:14:50] problem but a lot of people love the
[1:14:53] world more than they love of God that's
[1:14:58] right I I cannot imagine
[1:15:02] anything that I would trade for
[1:15:06] [Music]
[1:15:08] God I I couldn't imagine
[1:15:11] nothing that I would trade for this
[1:15:15] walk with
[1:15:18] God I want that to be
[1:15:20] sober CU people are going to watch this
[1:15:23] in Revelations chapter three and unto
[1:15:26] the angel of the Church of the Le oans
[1:15:28] write these things sayith the amen the
[1:15:30] faithful and the true witness the
[1:15:32] beginning of the creation of god notice
[1:15:35] what he says I Know Thy works that thou
[1:15:38] art neither cold nor hot I would that
[1:15:40] thou were cold or hot and so then
[1:15:43] because Thou Art lukewarm and neither
[1:15:44] cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my
[1:15:49] mouth god let's just put it like it is
[1:15:53] vomited
[1:15:55] amen this church world that's right come
[1:16:00] on are you with me now notice what they
[1:16:03] say because thou sayest I am rich and
[1:16:08] increased with goods and have need of
[1:16:10] nothing listen they can have church
[1:16:12] without
[1:16:14] god let's just be honest they can have
[1:16:17] church without
[1:16:19] God they can have pre a pre-prepared
[1:16:22] sermon that that is is
[1:16:26] palatable to the
[1:16:29] audience that is a a
[1:16:32] psychological
[1:16:34] speech that will move them in their
[1:16:37] spirit and on their
[1:16:39] flesh but they can go back Monday and be
[1:16:42] the same guy they were
[1:16:46] Saturday their dress code never changes
[1:16:49] their desires never
[1:16:53] change come on Church let's should be
[1:16:55] honest with you but if you take this
[1:16:58] message of the hour and deliver it in
[1:17:00] any of their
[1:17:09] audiences and knowest not that thou art
[1:17:12] wretched and miserable and poor and
[1:17:16] blind and
[1:17:19] naked I counsel thee to buy of me gold
[1:17:22] tried in the fire that thou mayest be
[1:17:25] rich and of white rment that thou mayest
[1:17:28] be clothed and that the shame of thy
[1:17:30] nakedness do not appear and anoint thine

[1:18:06] overcame and is sat down with my father
[1:18:09] in his throne and he that hath an ear
[1:18:13] let him hear what the spirit saith unto
[1:18:16] the
[1:18:17] churches I want to just give you a few
[1:18:19] quotes real quick he said look at the
[1:18:22] scriptures piled in here could it be is
[1:18:26] the third poll to preach to the Eternal
[1:18:30] doomed that's rejected the message of
[1:18:36] Salvation brother Brandon would make a
[1:18:38] statement even to where that we'll get
[1:18:40] to a point be no more saved
[1:18:45] amen says well the church is going yeah
[1:18:49] they will they'll go right on just the
[1:18:51] same but remember all this time Noah was
[1:18:53] in the ark
[1:18:55] and the bride is sealed with Christ and
[1:18:58] the the last member has been redeemed
[1:19:00] and the six seal has produced itself and
[1:19:02] the Seven seal brings him back to the
[1:19:05] earth and the lamb come and took the
[1:19:07] book out of the right hand and sat down
[1:19:09] and claimed what he owned what he has
[1:19:11] redeemed it's always been that third
[1:19:14] pull three is perfection the ministry
[1:19:17] come to its Perfection when it reproduce
[1:19:20] Christ again in natural amongst human
[1:19:23] beings
[1:19:25] listen Christ is not just in books and
[1:19:28] tapes and in your Bible it's in
[1:19:33] flesh it's in flesh I want you to get it
[1:19:36] you're the last representation to this
[1:19:38] Lost
[1:19:40] Generation oh think of it people could
[1:19:44] right on go or right on preaching he
[1:19:47] said people could go right on preaching
[1:19:50] thinking they're getting
[1:19:52] saved believing they're doing right
[1:19:55] believing their organizations are
[1:19:58] growing sure not even a ray of
[1:20:02] Hope and if that Vision was that it's
[1:20:07] been so hard against the women we have
[1:20:10] come to that hour the door is closed and
[1:20:13] gone already the book is in his
[1:20:17] hands you know this morning I I was up
[1:20:20] early and and I just I just I went back
[1:20:24] and I I I found a sermon 15 years ago
[1:20:28] brother bisc preached and brother Jason
[1:20:30] Jackson was all he was sitting on the
[1:20:32] platform I think I sent you the picture
[1:20:35] and had more hair
[1:20:38] then and so brother bis's preaching and
[1:20:41] when I turned it on I went over to a
[1:20:43] certain spot and I just reel forward not
[1:20:46] knowing what was getting ready to s be
[1:20:48] said and he comes out to the side of his
[1:20:51] pull pit and he says
[1:20:53] imagine When We're Gone they'll use this
[1:20:57] as a
[1:20:58] church and people will walk to this
[1:21:01] altar believing they're getting
[1:21:05] saved and I'm I come and I've got I've
[1:21:08] got this in my hands listen this church
[1:21:11] will be
[1:21:13] used of course we know brother B said
[1:21:15] some Churches become nothing but
[1:21:17] storehouses cobwebs on the ceiling be
[1:21:20] vacant buildings haunted places are you
[1:21:24] with me now
[1:21:25] listen the church is you it's not this
[1:21:27] building I want it to be as nice as we
[1:21:30] can have it but you're the church you're
[1:21:33] the Bride of Jesus Christ you're you are
[1:21:36] what makes this place
[1:21:40] special listen I appreciate every nail
[1:21:42] that went and every glue that went in
[1:21:44] every piece of wood but you're what
[1:21:47] makes this place special when he himself
[1:21:50] comes down but there will come a time
[1:21:55] when he takes you off of the earth and
[1:21:58] all of this will still be
[1:22:02] here think about it people coming
[1:22:05] here and come to the altar thinking
[1:22:07] they're being
[1:22:14] saved are you with me he said the
[1:22:17] sleeping virgin coming in trying to buy
[1:22:20] all this is that that when you that last
[1:22:23] of the Bride will come come in went in
[1:22:26] the rest of them was left there did you
[1:22:28] ever think what happened they went right
[1:22:31] on ahead preaching and thinking that
[1:22:33] they were getting Souls saved and
[1:22:34] everything and did not know it they knew
[1:22:38] nothing about it the church will go on
[1:22:42] thinking souls are being saved and
[1:22:46] everything else and the church the bride
[1:22:49] sealed
[1:22:50] away and don't know
[1:22:52] it that's EX L the scripture Noah went
[1:22:56] in the ark and God sealed it out the
[1:22:59] time will come when men and women will
[1:23:02] try will cry to God and even think that
[1:23:05] they're they've got something when they
[1:23:10] haven't folks I I let me just say this
[1:23:13] to you we don't want to miss
[1:23:18] it now this poem I put on my which was
[1:23:23] Danny Henry
[1:23:25] the spoken tongues and three
[1:23:27] interpreted because thou H has chosen
[1:23:30] the Narrow Path the harder way thou has
[1:23:34] walked in your own choosing thou has
[1:23:36] picked the correct and the precise
[1:23:38] decision and it is my way because of
[1:23:42] this momentous decision a huge portion
[1:23:45] of heaven will await
[1:23:49] thee we're part of
[1:23:53] that we're a part of that and he said
[1:23:57] what a glorious decision thou has made
[1:24:00] and this in itself is that which will
[1:24:03] give and make to come to pass that
[1:24:06] tremendous victory in the love
[1:24:11] divine
[1:24:13] now last night as Andrew
[1:24:16] spoke this dropped in my heart cuz I've
[1:24:19] been working with it all week in my
[1:24:22] mind as we stand here and preach we know
[1:24:26] that we're finishing
[1:24:30] up we know we're finishing up we we
[1:24:33] don't have 40 years left or 50 years
[1:24:35] left we know that we're finishing
[1:24:38] up and I'm honestly I pray that while I
[1:24:42] preach the spirit of God has conveyed
[1:24:45] across this audience and on the internet
[1:24:48] to where that people if they're not
[1:24:50] right with God will get right with God
[1:24:53] Amen
[1:24:55] I don't have any parameters God wrote
[1:24:57] the book he wrote the book I just have
[1:25:00] to preach the
[1:25:01] book and and and listen as we preach the
[1:25:04] word of God we preach the power of
[1:25:06] forgiveness and we preach the power of
[1:25:09] of his love let me just say I can't
[1:25:11] explain forgiveness for how great it
[1:25:15] is I can't explain how great the blood
[1:25:19] of Jesus Christ is in the moment that
[1:25:22] you ask God to forgive you you that's
[1:25:25] right you remember all of the things
[1:25:28] that you did that you've done the last
[1:25:30] years but when you ask God to forgive
[1:25:34] you God is as good as his
[1:25:37] word and it's REM it's removed from the
[1:25:43] memory it's removed from the
[1:25:46] memory and let me just say this you when
[1:25:48] God forgives you he forgives
[1:25:51] you don't pick up Stones when he
[1:25:54] forgives you he forgives you how deep is
[1:25:58] his
[1:26:00] love brother Marcus how deep is his
[1:26:06] love even while you're in
[1:26:09] sin while you're in the deepest of
[1:26:11] horrible situations God knows where
[1:26:14] you're going to wind
[1:26:16] up there's no Angels coming up and say
[1:26:19] look how bad they are look what a
[1:26:21] situation look at their failures
[1:26:24] God can say I got a
[1:26:26] plan I've got a blood for that and I got
[1:26:29] a
[1:26:30] [Applause]
[1:26:34] plan but can you imagine Through The
[1:26:37] Years 120 years
[1:26:40] preaching knowing that God's going to
[1:26:44] destroy the Earth amen right listen this
[1:26:48] isn't Small Potatoes
[1:26:50] here God's going to wash the the Earth
[1:26:55] and he going to clean he's going to
[1:26:57] clean it because God has
[1:27:00] repented that he has made
[1:27:07] man how many seen the rainbow
[1:27:12] lately how many seen a rainbow lately is
[1:27:14] this thing working at
[1:27:16] all I know we haven't had rain for a
[1:27:19] while but how many's ever seen a rainbow
[1:27:21] let me just put it like that
[1:27:26] seven colors in the rainbow they're
[1:27:28] perfect it's seven colors in the rainbow
[1:27:31] and I'm not going to go there it it's
[1:27:32] not part of the sermon but it's a
[1:27:35] promise it's a promise I'll not destroy
[1:27:38] the Earth with water but what is he
[1:27:40] going to destroy it
[1:27:42] with fire god writes a sermon in the
[1:27:48] heavens he writes a sermon in the
[1:27:50] heavens every time it rains
[1:27:54] oh I didn't never hear a preacher did
[1:27:56] you look
[1:27:58] up I never heard brother brandham did
[1:28:00] you look
[1:28:02] up God had a sermon in the heavens every
[1:28:06] time that it
[1:28:09] rained God
[1:28:11] preaches our Eternal God preaches he
[1:28:15] makes a
[1:28:17] promise but we're getting close to the
[1:28:21] promise surely I will do nothing except
[1:28:24] I reveal my servants to the prophets
[1:28:26] I'll not destroy the Earth but I'll send
[1:28:29] a prophet he sent Elijah he sent
[1:28:32] Noah he sent John the Baptist he sent
[1:28:34] William brandom I don't believe it's a
[1:28:37] prophet you
[1:28:39] will brother Ron I I've got so many
[1:28:41] things against brother brandom you
[1:28:43] will our critics
[1:28:52] will don't don't cut me off
[1:28:55] yet don't cut me off
[1:28:57] yet you
[1:29:06] will can you imagine making videos
[1:29:09] against the message
[1:29:11] on and how bad you hate the message you
[1:29:14] really don't hate the message you hate
[1:29:16] the word of
[1:29:19] God you don't just hate the preachers
[1:29:22] but you hate you you not only hate ha
[1:29:24] the preachers but you hate the prophet
[1:29:26] and then you you hate brother brandom
[1:29:29] and then you hate
[1:29:30] God because you have to have a new
[1:29:34] Bible you got to write a new Bible cuz
[1:29:36] the one that you got it burned your head
[1:29:39] so you got to write another
[1:29:41] Bible why do you think there's 44,000
[1:29:45] denominations even the smallest churches
[1:29:51] split are you with me no no notice now
[1:29:55] notice Noah got out there and preached
[1:29:57] the same message for 120
[1:30:01] years 120
[1:30:04] years what if Andrew got up and preached
[1:30:07] the same message every
[1:30:11] [Music]
[1:30:12] night every
[1:30:15] night you go is he
[1:30:21] studying Noah preached the same message
[1:30:25] message every
[1:30:27] day and he knew it was
[1:30:31] right nor was a man like me and
[1:30:34] you he felt for those people he loved
[1:30:39] his
[1:30:41] cousins he loved the nation he loved the
[1:30:45] people he loved Humanity or he wouldn't
[1:30:48] have preached he'd have said it's for me
[1:30:51] in my
[1:30:52] house bless God it's all that's coming
[1:30:56] in sorry bunch of Sinners out
[1:30:59] there let them die I don't think we can
[1:31:03] understand the devastation
[1:31:06] amen we got six or seven inches of rain
[1:31:09] the other
[1:31:10] day it washed my
[1:31:12] driveway you know it got
[1:31:15] muddy trees
[1:31:18] fell but can you imagine rain
[1:31:21] coming that won't stop the billers of
[1:31:25] the deep opening
[1:31:27] up I wanted to just share this quote to
[1:31:29] you it means a lot to me he said there
[1:31:32] is always borderline
[1:31:35] Believers I call them people that will
[1:31:37] come to church they'll enjoy the message
[1:31:39] maybe the maybe from the choir the
[1:31:41] singers or from the minister or the
[1:31:43] testimony they'll enjoy it but to come
[1:31:46] in and be a part of it they just won't
[1:31:48] do it they like to listen but they won't
[1:31:51] be a part of it they do not want to be
[1:31:54] identified with them they want to stay
[1:31:58] off on one side that's always been that
[1:32:00] way he said no doubt that was in that
[1:32:05] day that when the dark door closed many
[1:32:09] of those people said well let's go up
[1:32:11] and stand around if it comes to pass for
[1:32:15] instance the old man was
[1:32:17] right we all kind of thought that the
[1:32:20] old fell was a little bit off and I
[1:32:22] enjoyed listening to him pretty preach a
[1:32:24] little standing there at the door and
[1:32:27] now we we know that something's closed
[1:32:29] the door now he's a good old man and if
[1:32:32] it would happen some water would come
[1:32:35] while he'd take us
[1:32:43] in he said you don't want to strain
[1:32:45] God's goodness amen you want to be sure
[1:32:49] that you come in while there's a chance
[1:32:51] to come in now listen brother Brandon W
[1:32:54] just throwing off words here he could
[1:32:58] see Sodom and
[1:33:00] Gomorrah
[1:33:02] amen he could see the end taking place
[1:33:06] he could see the wedding supper he could
[1:33:09] see the war of Gog and MOG amen and
[1:33:13] listen he's telling us something you
[1:33:15] don't want to be a borderline
[1:33:18] believer now the first thing you know
[1:33:20] the first day look God strains his
[1:33:22] people once in a while sometimes I'd
[1:33:25] imagine the first day and Noah said to
[1:33:26] his family all right now we'll climb up
[1:33:29] to the into the stair upstairs and now
[1:33:31] in the morning the skies are going to
[1:33:33] going to be dark and there never was
[1:33:35] dark before and we've never seen it rain
[1:33:37] was going to fall and lightning will
[1:33:39] sweep across the skies and next morning
[1:33:41] up Comes the Sun and no sign and all day
[1:33:43] long no one his family looked things
[1:33:46] went on exactly the same way that they
[1:33:49] did I imagine border line Believers said
[1:33:53] the old fellow was wrong they went back
[1:33:55] downtown eating and drinking and being
[1:33:57] married and I imagine his family what a
[1:34:00] strain it must have been on on the man
[1:34:03] but he didn't give up and start knocking
[1:34:04] on the door and say people pry the door
[1:34:06] open I was wrong he knew he had
[1:34:10] truth I want to say that he knew he had
[1:34:13] truth and he held on to it and if it
[1:34:16] didn't rain today it'll rain
[1:34:19] tomorrow and then the second day come
[1:34:21] and we notice the sun came up and it
[1:34:23] crossed over it like it did every day no
[1:34:26] sign of rain still he was persistent 7
[1:34:28] days and Noah was sitting right there if
[1:34:30] it don't rain today it'll come tomorrow
[1:34:33] and he was anchored he was persistent he
[1:34:35] was perseverant because he know God said
[1:34:39] so if I don't see a resurrection today
[1:34:42] I'll look for it
[1:34:43] tomorrow if I don't see the Rapture
[1:34:46] today I'll look for it
[1:34:48] tomorrow I'm going to be persistent and
[1:34:51] finally on the seventh day when he
[1:34:53] looked out the window the skies were
[1:34:56] blackening the wind was blowing across
[1:34:58] the hills the trees were bending over
[1:35:01] people were screaming not knowing what
[1:35:03] to do and after a while great big drops
[1:35:07] of rain be to break down for For the
[1:35:09] First Time striking upon the streets
[1:35:13] sewers filled up all the Springs begin
[1:35:15] to break up water begin to rise up
[1:35:18] people got in their boats and they sank
[1:35:20] winds were rough and they got deeper and
[1:35:22] deeper and deeper and after a while it
[1:35:24] began to come upon the ship and he
[1:35:26] watched out the window and finally the
[1:35:29] people screaming there's no way for him
[1:35:32] to reach out and get them he was way up
[1:35:35] in the upper
[1:35:36] story they had send away their day of
[1:35:41] Grace and there was no more left for
[1:35:43] them and it's too late
[1:35:46] then finally what a feeling it must have
[1:35:49] been to Noah when he watched out on the
[1:35:52] street and see SE those little boats
[1:35:54] whether they were God trusted or not you
[1:35:57] see people today they construct their
[1:35:59] own Ark they make their own
[1:36:02] salvation you can't do that God made
[1:36:05] salvation for us you've got to accept it
[1:36:09] just a man constructed Ark will not
[1:36:11] stand anything that man can achieve
[1:36:14] that's contrary to the will and the word
[1:36:16] of God it will not stand my grandbabies
[1:36:21] I want you to know this there's rapture
[1:36:23] in this
[1:36:24] message and if I die and go by the way
[1:36:27] of the Grave you stay with this message
[1:36:29] with everything that's within you you
[1:36:32] eat it morning day and
[1:36:34] night it'll change your
[1:36:41] bodies but how would it just be when Mrs
[1:36:44] Noah and her's daughter-in-laws and Sons
[1:36:46] and when they seen that Ark coming up on
[1:36:48] the that water coming up on the ark and
[1:36:50] yet the ark was still sitting flat but
[1:36:54] after a while they begin to feel it cut
[1:36:57] loose what a day it'll
[1:36:59] be what a day it will be when you look
[1:37:02] down at your hands and your hands will
[1:37:03] be
[1:37:04] mov when you feel your legs and they're
[1:37:07] strong again and your back is strong
[1:37:09] what a feeling it'll
[1:37:19] be
[1:37:21] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:37:24] Noah knew that all of what of his what
[1:37:28] he had tried to achieve and what he had
[1:37:31] done his message was paying off
[1:37:34] then you say brother Ron I've been here
[1:37:36] 50 Years it'll pay
[1:37:39] off it'll pay off brother Vernon it'll
[1:37:42] pay off yes I want you to thank you for
[1:37:46] your faithfulness it'll pay

[1:44:37] hereen don't let that make you
[1:44:49] mad
[1:44:51] brother brother William gave me me this
[1:44:53] quotee this morning he said now that's
[1:44:56] what it
[1:44:56] was after the taking away of the Holy
[1:44:59] Spirit out of the earth that formal
[1:45:02] Church religion will go right on
[1:45:06] Amen not knowing the
[1:45:14] difference not knowing the difference so
[1:45:17] your televangelist will have services
[1:45:20] and they'll go right on not knowing the
[1:45:27] difference did you
[1:45:30] ever how many ever heard wasn't that
[1:45:34] astounding they don't know the holy
[1:45:38] spirit so they won't know when it's gone
[1:45:44] right I want you to think I want you to
[1:45:46] think real hard on this they don't know
[1:45:49] the holy
[1:45:50] spirit so they won't know when it's
[1:45:55] gone that's
[1:45:59] right they'll just go right on just the
[1:46:02] same and when the last one is sealed
[1:46:05] into when the last one is sealed into
[1:46:08] the body of Christ they'll still be
[1:46:10] going on trying to bring in converts
[1:46:12] because they don't know what it is and
[1:46:15] their formal religions will continue on
[1:46:17] just like they
[1:46:20] were now it might not sink into you
[1:46:24] like it did
[1:46:26] me but that was really an astounding
[1:46:32] statement they'll just go be go so far
[1:46:36] just in their religious rituals until
[1:46:39] they will not miss the holy spirit
[1:46:43] because they don't know what it is
[1:46:50] amen I'm sorry I I just buried Uncle
[1:46:53] this week brother Kenny just buried an
[1:46:56] uncle my uncle was a good
[1:46:58] man he was a phenomenal
[1:47:02] man I was living a very vulgar
[1:47:05] lifestyle pre-marriage
[1:47:08] and that Uncle he was a handsome man he
[1:47:12] he had one of them curly cues in the
[1:47:14] front of his
[1:47:15] head and he was a he was a pretty man
[1:47:18] because somebody told him that and he
[1:47:21] believed it
[1:47:26] ever meet somebody they think they're
[1:47:28] pretty you know
[1:47:31] better but they believed
[1:47:36] it we were setting we were setting the
[1:47:38] other day having a having a
[1:47:41] dinner and this girl came in and she was
[1:47:45] she was all dolled up and she was by
[1:47:47] herself she could tell she was a
[1:47:48] business woman she sat just across from
[1:47:50] us she got her computer she got all of
[1:47:53] her papers out and she went to work her
[1:47:55] breakfast came and it got cold and and
[1:47:58] uh I told Andrew I said Andrew you know
[1:48:01] why she's like that I said somebody told
[1:48:04] her she was pretty and she believed
[1:48:08] it now brother Ron that's an ugly
[1:48:10] statement but if you take all that
[1:48:12] Jezebel stuff off of
[1:48:16] her you take all that nonsense off of
[1:48:19] her that's that's only temporary and you
[1:48:22] realize that she's nothing but a bag of
[1:48:29] worms and if you realize what she really
[1:48:31] is is a bag of worms and she'll be
[1:48:34] guilty think about this she'll be
[1:48:37] guilty of causing men to lust after her
[1:48:41] and commit adultery with her in her
[1:48:45] heart and she'll go to hell without the
[1:48:48] blood of Jesus Christ on
[1:48:51] her amen I pray to God that she hears
[1:48:54] the
[1:48:55] message but if she hears it she's going
[1:48:58] to
[1:49:00] change listen the message will give you
[1:49:03] power to
[1:49:13] change I want you to think about this oh
[1:49:15] but brother Ron that's difficult I want
[1:49:18] you to think about this Noah and his
[1:49:21] family were
[1:49:23] saved
[1:49:26] yes how many million and maybe billion
[1:49:31] of
[1:49:32] humans not just
[1:49:34] livestock humans that had jobs and were
[1:49:39] Millionaires and were Hollywood
[1:49:42] ites and were had every realm of life
[1:49:47] but when the flood
[1:49:50] came none of that mattered
[1:49:56] I want you to think about another place
[1:49:58] let me just preach when the blood was
[1:50:02] applied over the lentil of the door if
[1:50:05] that blood was not applied in Moses's
[1:50:09] day if it was not
[1:50:11] applied the death angel was coming to
[1:50:14] your
[1:50:15] house it was coming to you and your
[1:50:18] oldest
[1:50:19] child was going to die
[1:50:25] your your animals some of them were
[1:50:28] going to
[1:50:30] die listen death was going to be
[1:50:33] everywhere to even change the heart of
[1:50:38] pharaoh amen listen what you and I are
[1:50:42] witnessing
[1:50:43] today and I I don't I'm
[1:50:47] sorry is Canon
[1:50:49] father amen
[1:50:55] people give you a hard time or you're
[1:50:58] seeing them
[1:51:00] naked and you listening to them and you
[1:51:02] see blue hair you see all of that this
[1:51:05] is their Heaven that's right this is
[1:51:08] their
[1:51:09] heaven and in a few days it's going to
[1:51:11] rain
[1:51:14] Hellfire and there's no message to get a
[1:51:16] hold of
[1:51:30] listen I believe there's good people in
[1:51:33] the earth and I'm talking about good
[1:51:36] people I spoke with brother Tom
[1:51:40] Hills Uncle Jerry that has pancreatic
[1:51:45] cancer I saw his wife looking over at
[1:51:48] him it was a look like I get from my
[1:51:50] wife once in a while and she was looking
[1:51:52] at him and she had that look in her eyes
[1:51:55] like I'm just glad I can share this
[1:51:58] moment with you I get that look once in
[1:52:00] a while maybe once a
[1:52:04] week just
[1:52:07] joke that look that special look and I
[1:52:12] saw her looking at him and brother Terry
[1:52:14] I walked over to him and you know things
[1:52:17] were going on at the wedding I walked
[1:52:19] over to him and you know you're in a
[1:52:22] battle he's in a battle you're in a
[1:52:24] battle and you know you you can just
[1:52:27] talk because you're in the same battle
[1:52:29] his is his pancreas and it's a death
[1:52:32] sentence and and you know when you're
[1:52:36] stage four it's a death sentence and you
[1:52:39] either believe the doctor's report or
[1:52:40] you believe God's
[1:52:42] report and so we just start talking we
[1:52:45] start talking about life and how much he
[1:52:48] loves his family and he and he said you
[1:52:51] know the greatest thing is is I love God
[1:52:54] I just love God and he just started
[1:52:57] talking about the love of
[1:52:59] God and I just felt the presence of the
[1:53:01] Lord as we
[1:53:05] talked and these were the thoughts that
[1:53:08] I came to God has a special place for
[1:53:12] people like
[1:53:13] this the Earth will be filled with
[1:53:17] redeemed bride and redeemed is way
[1:53:21] different
[1:53:22] are you with me like a wedding the Bride
[1:53:25] Comes but there's a whole lot of people
[1:53:27] comes to see the wedding and on this
[1:53:29] Earth there's been phenomenal people you
[1:53:33] delivered a dumpster the other day and
[1:53:35] you know I I'm playing my dad's part now
[1:53:38] Matthew's delivered and doing all the
[1:53:40] work and I'm getting out 90y old man 88y
[1:53:43] old woman and they're standing there and
[1:53:46] they're holding hands and he's telling
[1:53:49] me how much he loves her and and she's
[1:53:51] just reciprocating and she's just
[1:53:53] rubbing his shoulder and down his back
[1:53:55] you know and they were they both had
[1:53:57] been married and their their spouses
[1:54:00] died and they had children and and he
[1:54:02] looked up his he looked up her because
[1:54:05] she was a sweetheart when they was in
[1:54:07] high
[1:54:08] school he hadn't seen her for
[1:54:11] decades and he asked her if he could
[1:54:13] come see her he was from he was from up
[1:54:16] in Pittsburgh somewhere or another and
[1:54:17] she's down in Florida he goes to see her
[1:54:20] he said I tell you what when I got out
[1:54:22] of the car it was love at first
[1:54:28] sight and we stood there and started
[1:54:30] talking about the Lord and he kind of G
[1:54:32] me his life story and she gave me her
[1:54:34] life story and I thought you know they
[1:54:36] don't know brother Joe I'm going to use
[1:54:38] your I'm going to use your analogy they
[1:54:40] don't know the most important person
[1:54:42] they ever met in their life was
[1:54:45] me isn't that right brother Joe brother
[1:54:48] Joe would tell me that over and over I
[1:54:50] got it written down a lot of places and
[1:54:52] he would say the most important person
[1:54:55] that that person ever meets right is
[1:55:01] me why you're the link to the
[1:55:13] blood brother Ron but sin's got a hold
[1:55:17] of
[1:55:20] me I'm going to tell One More Story
[1:55:22] story and then I'll I I may finish this
[1:55:24] in a couple of
[1:55:28] weeks we've all been through through

[1:55:31] Wars we've all been through some
[1:55:34] Wars no a couple weeks is going to be
[1:55:37] Labor Day and I'm definitely not going

[1:55:44] to pay
[1:55:48] bills it's a good place to be you pay
[1:55:50] the bills that means you got money to
[1:55:52] pay the bills
[1:55:54] Amen brother Homer's favorite sermon
[1:55:57] sister Nancy's watching but his favorite
[1:55:59] sermon was spiritual
[1:56:02] Amnesia you'll not believe how many
[1:56:05] books that he printed off and gave to
[1:56:08] people gave it to the
[1:56:10] auctioneer actually he gave it to your
[1:56:13] uncle I was there when he handed it to
[1:56:15] your
[1:56:16] uncle he gave it to a lot of different
[1:56:19] people people spiritual Amnesia brother
[1:56:22] brandom is telling Pentecost you forgot
[1:56:24] where you came
[1:56:26] from he's telling the denominational the
[1:56:28] world don't forget where you come from
[1:56:31] and brother brandham was he come to
[1:56:35] about three qus the way through the
[1:56:37] sermon and he goes overseas and he
[1:56:40] starts talking about they had a a
[1:56:43] train and he says the story was told he
[1:56:46] said they had a train that was carrying
[1:56:47] Soldiers Home and he said these soldiers
[1:56:51] had lost their minding at War said it
[1:56:54] comes to a place to where you you lose
[1:56:56] your mind you just can't handle it no
[1:56:57] more so they were sending them to an
[1:57:01] institution and the and the train would
[1:57:04] go on and it would come to a stop and
[1:57:06] they would let them get off and they'd
[1:57:08] watch him and said on this one
[1:57:11] stop he said this one soldier was
[1:57:15] looking at a water
[1:57:17] tower he called it water tank he said he
[1:57:20] was looking at that water tank and said
[1:57:23] he began to
[1:57:25] walk and after a little while he he
[1:57:27] found a familiar path and the guard was
[1:57:31] watching him he was watching him because
[1:57:34] people in the wrong mind will walk off
[1:57:37] but this one had a different purpose and
[1:57:40] he's walking up that path and as he's
[1:57:42] walking up the path he's walking he goes
[1:57:45] up over the
[1:57:46] hill and then he goes over another Hill
[1:57:49] And the guard's walking along behind him
[1:57:51] not letting the Soldier know what he's
[1:58:01] doing now
[1:58:03] Marcus it's hard to be very private with
[1:58:06] you but when I wrote this note down I
[1:58:10] said Marcus will be here to hear it this
[1:58:14] morning and I'll tell this story for
[1:58:17] him I didn't know you was going to be
[1:58:20] here but he did
[1:58:24] did brother Ron that's just way off
[1:58:28] okay last year at the
[1:58:30] fair I was in the chicken house where
[1:58:34] the little chickens and the peees are
[1:58:37] and I was watching an auction I had no
[1:58:39] intentions to
[1:58:41] buy Hot Wheel
[1:58:43] cars and the Lord spoke to him he said
[1:58:46] byy them David Dexter collects them and
[1:58:49] he will be at the Labor Day meeting well
[1:58:52] I bought them I bought about a hundred
[1:58:54] of them if I do something I do it really
[1:58:57] well now I didn't know
[1:59:00] that and you don't know what it means
[1:59:03] when I walked in and there set David
[1:59:05] Dexter and the next night I went and got
[1:59:08] a bag and I fill that bag full of Hot
[1:59:10] Wheel cars and I comeing I said Hey
[1:59:13] listen the Lord spoke to me to buy these
[1:59:15] for you and he told me that you would be
[1:59:17] here you can imagine what his face is
[1:59:20] looking like now here's what what I'm
[1:59:22] telling you God's got a Rapture for you
[1:59:24] and he's prepared a place for you he
[1:59:26] knows you're going to be
[1:59:42] there and so he walked up over the
[1:59:44] second Hill And the guard's following
[1:59:47] him can you imagine how intriguing this
[1:59:49] was he's following him there's hundreds
[1:59:52] of soldiers there but he's following
[1:59:55] this one and this one has a
[1:59:58] purpose something's coming back to him
[2:00:02] something's coming back to
[2:00:15] him he going across the
[2:00:17] hill there a little house with a picked
[2:00:20] fence
[2:00:22] a
[2:00:24] tree smoke coming up out of the
[2:00:27] chimney there's an old man sitting on
[2:00:29] the
[2:00:30] porch he walks up to that picket fence
[2:00:33] and there stands his
[2:00:36] daddy he said Son they told me that you
[2:00:38] were dead but I didn't believe it
[2:00:43] welcome
[2:00:48] home I've experienced that in my life
[2:00:53] welcome
[2:00:55] home brother Jimmy you've experienced it
[2:00:58] now each and every one of you have
[2:01:00] experienced it brother Andy we've been a
[2:01:04] long road
[2:01:05] now we've experienced it and there's no
[2:01:08] place like
[2:01:10] home this world makes us very
[2:01:13] sick makes us
[2:01:16] nauseated makes us
[2:01:18] tormented we we get so disgusted with it
[2:01:24] but this ain't
[2:01:31] home the missionary got off of the
[2:01:34] ship and all the celebrities they had a
[2:01:37] parade for
[2:01:40] him and calling their
[2:01:44] names and he gets off the ship and he
[2:01:46] just start
[2:01:48] walking as he walks
[2:01:52] along the boardwalk he's now kind of
[2:01:56] disappointed even depressed a
[2:01:59] bit there's no parade for me I've been
[2:02:02] on the mission field all of these years
[2:02:05] and nobody came to welcome me
[2:02:08] home you can imagine what loneliness
[2:02:10] feels
[2:02:13] like and God spoke to him said you're
[2:02:17] not home yet
[2:02:19] [Applause]
[2:02:32] I believe I'll use that
[2:02:34] more don't you love the Lord let's stand
[2:02:36] this
[2:02:40] morning
[2:02:41] amen maybe you just don't know the
[2:02:45] Lord maybe you just like to say brother
[2:02:47] Ryan would you remember me remember me
[2:02:53] can I tell you just one more as the
[2:02:55] musicians
[2:02:59] come as a little boy I heard this
[2:03:02] message all my
[2:03:06] life never never knew what Pentecost the
[2:03:09] world Pentecost is or Methodist or
[2:03:13] Baptist any of those denominations I
[2:03:16] knew what the message
[2:03:18] was so I heard the message is in fourth
[2:03:22] grade and I jumped up on a desk and told
[2:03:24] them that the world was coming to an end
[2:03:25] in
[2:03:26] 1977 Los Angeles dropping beneath the
[2:03:30] ocean yeah I got detention for
[2:03:34] that but that's what I knew that's what
[2:03:37] I believe that's what I was being
[2:03:42] taught but you know we lived in a
[2:03:45] trailer we lived in a 70 by 14 trailer
[2:03:49] and Dad built Wings off of it everywhere
[2:03:52] it was home it was
[2:03:54] nice and you know I lived on the other
[2:03:56] end of the trailer and you know I go up
[2:03:58] that hallway in the night I'd wake up
[2:04:01] I'd wake up and it was Pitch Black dad
[2:04:03] didn't believe in having lights on in
[2:04:05] the night and so I'd struggle my way up
[2:04:08] through the the trailer and I'd get to
[2:04:09] the kitchen then i' get to the living
[2:04:11] room and i' I'd get up to that their
[2:04:14] bedroom
[2:04:15] door and I would think nothing I can't
[2:04:18] hear anything and I think oh I pray that
[2:04:21] Rapture didn't happen and I'm left
[2:04:24] behind but I get to that door brother
[2:04:29] Jim and my mother was a real good
[2:04:34] snore my daddy too but my mother was a
[2:04:38] champ and I could hear that echo of that
[2:04:43] bear you don't know how it felt that I
[2:04:47] wasn't alone
[2:04:53] I never want to walk into this building
[2:04:56] and everybody be gone on a Sunday
[2:05:03] morning I don't want to be a part of
[2:05:06] that
[2:05:08] feeling I want you to think about deeply
[2:05:11] on that heart what are you doing with
[2:05:13] your

[2:06:40] years but it must have been so
[2:06:44] passionate when he sees two by two
[2:06:47] animals
[2:06:49] coming cuz he knew then
[2:06:53] it's just going to be a few
[2:06:54] [Music]
[2:06:57] days so now he sermons take a higher
[2:07:02] octave and he preaches like never
[2:07:04] before Lord we as message beli in
[2:07:08] Preachers our octave has went up another
[2:07:11] level cuz we can see the signs we're not
[2:07:14] seeing two by
[2:07:15] two we can see our governments and we
[2:07:19] can see the conditions of Sodom
[2:07:23] we can see the world taking its
[2:07:25] turns but we can see the bride in
[2:07:28] Revival it's been going on a long time
[2:07:31] but it's taking a higher

[2:16:43] flow through
[2:16:46] me
[2:16:48] Holy Spirit
[2:16:56] I couldn't imagine being setting in a
[2:16:58] building in 1965 and a prophet is
[2:17:02] preaching one of the greatest messages
[2:17:04] on the choosing of a
[2:17:09] bride and he's speaking to his wife
[2:17:12] speaking to God's
[2:17:15] wife and there's the elect lady and
[2:17:17] she's she's finding out that she's found
[2:17:20] her place in
[2:17:21] him but there are those that get so
[2:17:24] upset at the prophet for the preaching
[2:17:26] of the word that they begin to chew gum
[2:17:29] they begin to make mockeries in front of
[2:17:31] the word of God they begin to light up
[2:17:35] cigarettes they were so upset at the
[2:17:38] word of
[2:17:40] God they walked out brother brandom
[2:17:44] right there condemns that generation and
[2:17:47] condemns the city called the city of
[2:17:52] Angels you know what he said about that
[2:17:54] you know what he said about Los Angeles
[2:17:56] could you imagine sitting there in that
[2:17:59] condition getting so mad at the word of
[2:18:01] God that you just want to walk
[2:18:04] out how grateful are we this morning
[2:18:07] that we could sit here under the
[2:18:08] preaching of the
[2:18:09] word not with that kind of a spirit but
[2:18:13] with a spirit of humility say God
[2:18:17] whatever I've got to
[2:18:19] do to match the word of this
[2:18:22] hour I want that kind of a heart can you
[2:18:26] I can't even put myself in that kind of
[2:18:28] mindset of the people to get that upset
[2:18:31] at the word because it's not in me it's
[2:18:34] not in me but if it's in you to be able
[2:18:38] to say Lord forgive me of my faults
[2:18:43] forgive me where I let down my word I
[2:18:46] think you ought to lift your hands I
[2:18:48] think you ought to lift your voice I
[2:18:50] ought to I think you ought to just
[2:18:52] Express the appreciation from your soul
[2:18:55] that you have a
[2:18:57] heart a hard to receive the
[2:19:04] word
