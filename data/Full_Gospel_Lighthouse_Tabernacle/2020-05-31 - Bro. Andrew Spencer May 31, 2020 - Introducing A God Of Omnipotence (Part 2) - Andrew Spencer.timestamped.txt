[0:11] certainly my brother
[0:13] he said years ago i used to think i was
[0:16] somebody
[0:17] so i thought i was really a christian
[0:19] and he said then up in our church i had
[0:21] to climb a hill
[0:22] where i stopped my little car and said i
[0:24] had to climb a hill about
[0:25] all three or four hundred yards to get
[0:27] around the bushes and things getting up
[0:29] and said we'd have prayer meeting up
[0:30] there and said

[0:53] party's against one another you know i
[0:54] raised i said yes sir he said oh my road

[1:32] little short steps trying to get up
[1:34] and i said fella can i help you pack

[1:43] so i knew that it was a vision he had
[1:45] scars in his hand

[42:00] i've been i've been quite moved
[42:03] by these things and moved by these
[42:05] studies
[42:06] and i don't feel adequate enough to be
[42:10] able to
[42:11] i don't have the vocabulary to be able
[42:13] to describe how
[42:14] how god how great he truly is
[42:18] but i believe that if god could
[42:22] take a hold of a little bitty redneck
[42:25] this morning and use me that he might be
[42:28] able to
[42:28] declare himself and because when he
[42:31] comes and he starts
[42:32] speaking to us from his word
[42:36] it's so much greater than man's word
[42:39] and so we we just want the spirit of the
[42:42] lord to speak to us this morning
[42:45] and we don't want to get caught up on
[42:47] the flesh realm where we just see one
[42:49] another here
[42:50] but let's see jesus this morning i think
[42:53] that if you
[42:54] if you have not and maybe you already
[42:56] have and i know that you were here
[42:58] that you that were here last weekend you
[43:01] heard brother ron's sermon on who is
[43:02] jesus and to me
[43:05] it's one of brother ron's climax
[43:07] messages and uh
[43:09] it's a very pertinent message so i
[43:11] encourage you if you listen to it
[43:12] go and listen to it again it'll do your
[43:14] heart great good
[43:16] this morning second kings chapter two
[43:18] and verse six
[43:20] the bible says in elijah elijah said
[43:23] unto him
[43:24] terry terry i pray thee here for the
[43:28] lord hath
[43:29] sent me to jordan
[43:32] and he said as the lord liveth and as
[43:34] thy soul liveth i will not leave thee
[43:36] and they too went on and fifty men of
[43:39] the sons of the prophets went and stood
[43:41] to view afar off and
[43:43] and they two stood by jordan and elijah
[43:47] took his mantle and wrapped it together
[43:51] and smote the waters and they were
[43:53] divided hither and thither
[43:55] so that they too went over on dry ground
[43:58] now we've we're very familiar with this
[44:00] scripture we're very familiar with this
[44:02] story
[44:03] i'd say even young children today could
[44:05] probably rehearse this to us
[44:07] but i want you to to capture
[44:10] how great a event this is
[44:13] this is not just this is not just an
[44:16] ordinary man that's walking down to the
[44:18] banks of a river to go fishing
[44:20] but this man is walking down with his
[44:22] servant elisha and he's walking down
[44:25] now there there you have to understand
[44:27] the scene that is taking place
[44:28] that the schools of the prophets are
[44:30] standing behind them and
[44:31] are watching what's getting ready to
[44:33] take place and you understand that
[44:36] that elisha knew that the lord was going
[44:38] to take away elijah on that day
[44:41] and yet he still journeyed on but
[44:45] i want you to capture this morning how
[44:48] great
[44:48] and significant an event this is
[44:52] that there had been others there had
[44:54] been there had been moses that
[44:56] and the children of israel that walked
[44:58] over on dry ground
[44:59] there had been joshua and the children
[45:01] of israel that walked on
[45:02] on dry ground and so many times we
[45:04] rehearse those things
[45:06] and we are familiar with those things
[45:08] but we allow those things to become
[45:10] so uh we we allow them to be so custom
[45:14] to us that we're
[45:15] that we're so accustomed to the
[45:16] supernatural that it's just
[45:18] that it's just everyday life for some
[45:20] people but don't get
[45:21] don't get so encapsulated that this is
[45:24] the way
[45:24] things are but this is a supernatural
[45:27] god
[45:28] and only he can produce those things
[45:31] and elijah took his mantle and wrapped
[45:32] it together and smote the waters and
[45:34] they were divided hither and thither
[45:37] so that they too went over on dry ground
[45:39] and it came to pass when they were gone
[45:41] over
[45:42] that elijah said unto elisha
[45:45] ask what i shall do for thee before i be
[45:47] taken away from thee
[45:49] and elijah elisha said i pray thee
[45:52] let a double portion of thy spirit be
[45:55] upon me
[45:56] and he said thou has asked a hard thing
[45:58] nevertheless
[46:00] if very big word if thou see me when i
[46:03] am taken away from thee
[46:05] it shall be so unto thee but if not
[46:08] it shall not be so how many here has a
[46:11] need this morning like to take before
[46:13] the lord
[46:14] amen god sees your hand this morning
[46:16] heavenly father we come before your
[46:18] throne of mercy lord this morning
[46:20] expressing our
[46:21] our love and our gratitude for the
[46:23] opportunity to be in the house of the
[46:25] lord
[46:26] to be able to stand in your august
[46:28] presence here this morning and
[46:30] to stand here and know that the living
[46:32] god is amongst us
[46:34] and that your children have gathered to
[46:36] to
[46:37] to eat upon the revealed word of the our
[46:40] father we pray that you would speak from
[46:42] heaven
[46:42] lord as we've already expressed we're
[46:44] not capable in our own humanity to be
[46:47] able to
[46:48] bring forth in the the dialogue and the
[46:50] vocabulary to be able to present to the
[46:53] people
[46:54] how great you truly are but this i know
[46:57] father that if i can get myself out of
[46:59] the way and that you can use these
[47:01] mortal lips and this mortal clay to
[47:03] speak through father
[47:05] that your name will be high and lifted
[47:07] up father
[47:08] lord i believe that it is the whole duty
[47:10] of man to be able to
[47:12] to lift up the name of jesus and to
[47:15] praise a true and living god
[47:17] lord i pray today that you would come
[47:20] and you would receive our worship
[47:22] i pray that you would look out upon
[47:24] those uplifted hands this morning and
[47:26] that you would reach out and touch them
[47:28] whatever that need is o god we know that
[47:31] you're more than enough to take care of
[47:33] that situation
[47:35] so we pray today that you would go forth
[47:37] and let us see your majesty declared
[47:40] lord jesus our hearts are open our minds
[47:43] are ready to receive oh god and i pray
[47:45] that your people as they would begin to
[47:47] pull on that word
[47:49] may you begin to speak to them from
[47:51] heaven
[47:52] father we love you today and we glorify
[47:54] the god of heaven
[47:55] in the name of jesus christ amen
[47:59] you may be seated this morning in the
[48:01] presence of the lord
[48:02] so said we'd like to speak to you on
[48:05] introducing
[48:06] the god of omnipotence and we know we
[48:09] know what omnipotence means it means
[48:11] it means to be the all-powerful and none
[48:14] of us sitting here this morning
[48:16] we have a portion of that but we are not
[48:18] all-powerful
[48:19] we are not unlimited we are limited in
[48:22] our faculties
[48:23] we have the abilities to be able to use
[48:26] our resources
[48:28] and be able to speak and be able to
[48:30] function but at the end of the day you
[48:32] get weary and you get tired you get wore
[48:34] out and there's some things that just
[48:36] get too much for your mind sometimes
[48:38] but there is a god that is ever present
[48:40] here this morning that is
[48:42] that is not weary and he's not wore out
[48:45] he's not in crisis mode he's not shook
[48:48] up he's not tore up and i want you to
[48:50] know that
[48:51] christ is not diminishing and whatsoever
[48:54] he's not fleeting
[48:55] he's not failing and he is the
[48:58] infinite god that knows all things that
[49:01] he is proving himself that he's the same
[49:04] yesterday
[49:05] today and forever and that all of his
[49:08] attributes are available to us
[49:10] as believers of this message that there
[49:13] are things that have
[49:15] been dispersed in this hour that that
[49:18] the carnal mind cannot grasp in its own
[49:20] senses but it takes a spiritual
[49:23] revelation
[49:25] to be able to grab a hold of the things
[49:27] that have been released in this hour and
[49:30] we know that
[49:31] that when when the church disbelieves
[49:34] satan and she believes the spirit's
[49:37] revelation of the word that the gates of
[49:40] hell shall not prevail against her
[49:43] so we realize this morning that we
[49:45] cannot be standing upon our own thoughts
[49:47] or on our own merits or what we've
[49:49] learned or our own knowledge of
[49:51] what the message is and on what we think
[49:54] things are
[49:55] this is the way things are but we've got
[49:57] to be standing
[49:58] on the revelation of the word for we
[50:00] know that we are up against the foe
[50:02] that we're up against an enemy that has
[50:04] been on the job for over 6
[50:06] 000 years and as we know in time that
[50:09] he's been on the battle he's been on the
[50:10] job he's been working
[50:12] he's been studying your dna and he's
[50:14] looking at you
[50:15] he's looking at your family history and
[50:17] he's looking at the cycles that your
[50:20] family has not been able to break
[50:22] so we know that we have an opponent that
[50:24] has been studying us
[50:26] and as satan's eden brother branham
[50:28] would say that that he's going to
[50:30] deliver
[50:31] something to you that will help you keep
[50:33] the punches
[50:34] off of you so we look and we can look at
[50:37] this
[50:37] as we would look at a champion this
[50:39] morning we look at a boxer
[50:41] how that those two opponents are coming
[50:43] up against each other
[50:44] that they are studying one another
[50:46] they're studying how they practice
[50:48] they're studying their habits
[50:50] and they're looking for a certain
[50:52] weakness and here we are
[50:54] in this great contest of time between
[50:56] god and satan
[50:57] and the power of the living god and the
[51:00] power of satan this hour
[51:02] as we're watching as a church of the
[51:04] living god is standing here
[51:06] that we're watching that satan himself
[51:09] has has come against the church of the
[51:11] living god
[51:12] and that he is going to he is going to
[51:15] try to strike you
[51:16] he's going to try to torment you he's
[51:18] going to try to destroy you
[51:20] he's going to try to tear you down he's
[51:22] going to try to beat you
[51:23] up so he is studying you and it is our
[51:27] duty
[51:27] as the sons and daughters of god to be
[51:30] able to study his tactic
[51:32] and watch what he's going to do how he's
[51:34] going to try to come with an uppercut
[51:36] and how he's going to stand his feet and
[51:38] how he's going to approach in the battle
[51:40] and how he gets weak and how he is
[51:43] defeated
[51:44] i can already give you the secret to
[51:45] this this morning
[51:47] that it's the word of god that will whip
[51:49] the devil any time
[51:50] any place under any circumstance under
[51:53] any situation over
[51:54] any sickness and we have the word of god
[51:57] this morning
[51:58] to be able to cover up satan this
[52:00] morning
[52:02] i wish i had somebody to preach to this
[52:04] morning that that we
[52:05] have the very literal life of god this
[52:08] morning
[52:09] to be able to cover up satan with this
[52:12] morning
[52:13] to be able to push him down cover him up
[52:16] and know that there is a living
[52:18] god that is here that is present and
[52:20] more than able to do
[52:22] what you cannot even comprehend in your
[52:24] own mind this morning
[52:27] now we know that god has always he's
[52:30] always required
[52:31] a believer in every day he's looking for
[52:34] that one man and how many would say that
[52:36] i'll be that one man this morning i'll
[52:38] be that one lady or one
[52:40] sister here but the bible tells us in
[52:42] romans 3 and 3 that
[52:44] what if some did not believe shall their
[52:47] unbelief make the faith of god
[52:50] without effect god forbid yea let god be
[52:53] true
[52:53] but every man a liar as it is written
[52:56] that thou mayest
[52:57] mightest be justified in thy sayings and
[53:00] mightest overcome when thou
[53:02] art judged you see there are things that
[53:04] happen in every one of our lives we're
[53:06] not exempt to things
[53:08] but there are things that have happened
[53:09] in our lives
[53:11] and the reason there that there are
[53:13] things that come
[53:14] and you watch a person as they are under
[53:17] that circumstance or under that trial
[53:20] that they they seem as if their feet are
[53:23] planted
[53:24] on a sturdy rock and it's if they're
[53:26] unmovable
[53:27] and it's like a christian today is like
[53:30] stonewall jackson back in the civil war
[53:32] he stood there in the opposition with
[53:35] bullets flying around him
[53:36] and i believe that there is a people on
[53:39] earth today
[53:40] that is standing on thus saith the lord
[53:42] that knows where they're standing at
[53:44] they're not afraid to stand they're not
[53:46] afraid to go through the fiery trials
[53:48] they're not afraid to face opposition
[53:51] because you see
[53:52] there are people that will give up in a
[53:54] battle there are people that will back
[53:56] off there are people
[53:58] that will doubt but you can't make a
[54:00] believer
[54:01] doubt no matter what you put on him why
[54:04] because he's a believer
[54:06] you can put sickness on him and he'll
[54:08] still believe you can
[54:10] you can put sickness or doubt on a lady
[54:12] of grace
[54:13] and she's still going to believe because
[54:15] she's a believer
[54:16] she was chosen before the foundation of
[54:18] the world brother doug
[54:20] that she would stand in the hour of
[54:22] torment
[54:23] we realize that we're living in an hour
[54:25] and you look at the nation today
[54:27] they're so tore up and there there's
[54:29] riots that are going on there's fear
[54:30] there there's tactics
[54:32] that are taking place and people are in
[54:34] pandemonium
[54:35] and they're catching up with the things
[54:37] that are going on but
[54:38] i have a word from you that we have a
[54:41] word that is made clear to us
[54:44] the modern events made clear by prophecy
[54:47] that we know that these things are
[54:49] coming and that there
[54:50] is a there is darkness all over egypt
[54:54] but there is light down here in goshen
[54:56] children
[54:57] don't you be so caught up with the
[54:59] things that are going on in the world
[55:01] i want you to know that before one drop
[55:04] one bomb drops on this nation
[55:06] there's going to be a people that will
[55:08] be taken up in a moment
[55:10] in a twinkling of an eye so don't you
[55:13] get your eyes on fear
[55:16] oh hallelujah you see the reason why
[55:19] you're here today
[55:20] is because that you are a believer and
[55:23] that you're standing on this word i
[55:25] believe that's why you're not afraid
[55:27] that's why you're not afraid to go into
[55:29] the valley and to take
[55:31] and walk down through and carry your
[55:33] stones of faith and
[55:35] carry jesus with you is that right is
[55:37] that why you're here this morning is
[55:39] because you're a believer
[55:41] you're a believer of the great i am and
[55:43] he is the omnipotent god and
[55:45] i i i don't as i said i don't have the
[55:48] vocabulary
[55:49] to be able to tell you how great this
[55:51] god is but i can take the scriptures and
[55:54] i can tell you
[55:56] what he has said about himself and this
[55:58] i've learned
[55:59] that if you go to talking about god
[56:03] god shows up so this morning if you
[56:06] don't mind i'd like to talk about him
[56:08] and i talk
[56:09] i like to talk about his host of armies
[56:12] and i'd like to talk about you
[56:15] i know that if i get to bragging on you
[56:17] in the natural realm you get a little
[56:18] you get a little excited because i'm
[56:20] talking about you
[56:21] so this morning i'm going to talk about
[56:22] you but i'm not going to talk about you
[56:24] in your natural realm
[56:25] i'm going to talk about who you are in
[56:27] christ jesus
[56:28] i'm going to talk about how great you
[56:30] are and how satan can't defeat you
[56:33] why because there is a god that is here
[56:35] this morning
[56:36] that is you as christians are packing on
[56:38] the inside of your soul
[56:40] and we realize this morning that that
[56:43] we're conscious
[56:44] of that angelic realm that is here this
[56:47] morning
[56:48] because the bible tells us that the
[56:50] angels of the lord are encamped about
[56:52] them that fear him
[56:54] and we realize this morning that you are
[56:57] those that
[56:58] are believers that fear him and we
[57:00] understand
[57:01] that there are angels that are here this
[57:04] morning that have come to watch you as
[57:06] you worship
[57:07] that the prophet would tell us that
[57:09] those angels
[57:10] are standing at attention this morning
[57:13] we're conscious
[57:14] we're conscious that they're here now
[57:17] you may not see them but you are
[57:19] influenced by that angelic realm this
[57:21] morning
[57:22] that you brother branham said in one
[57:24] spot that you've been bumping into them
[57:27] you've been bumping into them and it
[57:28] changes your attitude it changes your
[57:31] avenues of life but daily we're bumping
[57:34] into
[57:35] angelic people and angelic beings that
[57:38] are there
[57:39] and we realize that though we may not
[57:41] see it but we can feel
[57:43] the brush of angels wings
[57:46] but i want you to know this morning
[57:48] children that god didn't show up in
[57:51] elkton
[57:52] just to watch the angel stand that
[57:54] attention
[57:55] he showed up in elkton this morning to
[57:58] watch you
[57:58] his children to watch you
[58:02] worship he's moved by your need
[58:07] i i've been working on a project behind
[58:10] the scenes and
[58:11] we'll try to make that available as soon
[58:13] as we can
[58:14] but we've been working on some things
[58:16] and and
[58:18] there you'll hear some of these things
[58:19] that i will maybe speak of this morning
[58:22] but early early very early in the
[58:24] spencer's walk
[58:26] in our walk with this message that you
[58:29] you've heard this story before that
[58:31] that there was one morning where people
[58:34] used to walk
[58:35] the streets back in those days they
[58:36] don't walk them like they do with some
[58:38] people walking but you just didn't let
[58:39] people you don't let people in like you
[58:41] do now
[58:42] like you did then you're afraid to open
[58:44] the door for anybody but
[58:46] back then it was more a common thing
[58:48] when people would walk the streets and
[58:50] and my teeny my papa were there in their
[58:53] house and
[58:54] and my dad and my uncle mark were very
[58:57] very young boys at that time
[58:59] but there was a stranger that had walked
[59:01] up the house and
[59:03] walked up and knocked on the door and he
[59:05] and he asked if he could just have
[59:07] something to eat and
[59:08] they were sitting there having biscuits
[59:10] and gravy
[59:11] they were sitting there having biscuits
[59:13] and gravy so they invited this train
[59:15] drone in
[59:16] into the household there and they begin
[59:18] to commune with him and speak to him and
[59:20] my papa charlie would sit and converse
[59:23] with this with this stranger and speak
[59:25] to him
[59:26] he said and he ate his he ate his
[59:28] biscuits and gravy and
[59:29] oh i wish i had some of that this
[59:31] morning but and you know
[59:33] he sat there and he ate some of those
[59:35] things and and
[59:37] as he got up he began to walk towards
[59:40] the door
[59:41] and he turned around and he laid his
[59:43] hand over on our pastor
[59:45] which is a little boy at that time and
[59:47] said you have a blessed life
[59:50] and they told him that he said that
[59:51] stranger said this is a blessed home
[59:54] this is a blessed boy right here and as
[59:56] that stranger stepped
[59:58] out onto that platform of that concrete
[1:00:01] way
[1:00:02] he stepped out there and as they were
[1:00:04] watching that stranger vanished right
[1:00:07] before their eyes
[1:00:08] and they walked back and forth and they
[1:00:10] were looking they were looking for him
[1:00:12] they walked the streets they walked and
[1:00:14] seen where he was
[1:00:15] to see if they could find him and they
[1:00:17] couldn't find it and they realized what
[1:00:19] the bible had said to them
[1:00:21] that that be aware that you are
[1:00:24] entertaining straight
[1:00:25] angels unaware so we understand that
[1:00:28] this morning
[1:00:30] that we have been a blessed people i
[1:00:32] want you to know i have been affected by
[1:00:34] that angel
[1:00:35] i'd say that this church has been
[1:00:37] affected by that angel
[1:00:39] you see it because you see there is an
[1:00:41] angelic realm
[1:00:42] that maybe you don't know of this
[1:00:44] morning or maybe you're not
[1:00:45] conscious of but i want you to know that
[1:00:47] you can feel their effects
[1:00:49] i can feel his effect standing at this
[1:00:51] platform this morning
[1:00:53] because i realize that he told me
[1:00:56] that he would be there with me i told
[1:00:59] him a long time ago
[1:01:00] that as long as you were with me i would
[1:01:02] do your work and children i'm telling
[1:01:04] you
[1:01:04] without a shadow of a doubt he stood by
[1:01:07] this platform
[1:01:08] time in and time out i've never walked
[1:01:11] to this platform
[1:01:12] except for a time or a time where i
[1:01:14] didn't feel him
[1:01:15] that i didn't know that he was there
[1:01:17] because he's a god
[1:01:19] that is committed to keep his promise
[1:01:21] and maybe you don't see it this morning
[1:01:23] but there's an angel that is dispatched
[1:01:26] to take care of you
[1:01:27] to watch over you to minister to you
[1:01:32] oh hallelujah those angels are there
[1:01:35] they're watching you every one of you
[1:01:37] you little children
[1:01:38] you've got an angel that's watching over
[1:01:40] you
[1:01:43] hallelujah you got an angel that's
[1:01:45] watching over you remember that time
[1:01:47] brother branham got on billy paul for
[1:01:49] how he struck his son
[1:01:50] and he told him he said you did that out
[1:01:52] of anger
[1:01:53] and when you did you affected you you
[1:01:56] hurt the angel the lord when you did
[1:01:58] that out of anger
[1:01:59] but never to do that and brother branham
[1:02:02] would teach us
[1:02:03] that even people of what we would say of
[1:02:06] mental retardation or
[1:02:08] or that style or that style of human
[1:02:10] being that those kind of people
[1:02:12] have a special angel just like children
[1:02:16] have a special angel over them so
[1:02:19] parents you can get all excited about
[1:02:21] your children that they got to do this
[1:02:23] or they got to do that
[1:02:24] there is somebody that's more powerful
[1:02:26] than you
[1:02:28] oh hallelujah is anybody in the church
[1:02:31] of god this morning
[1:02:32] but there's an angel that is watching
[1:02:35] over your children
[1:02:36] and that we realize that those angels
[1:02:39] are here
[1:02:40] that those angels are moving that those
[1:02:42] angels are acting hallelujah
[1:02:44] in god's seed we look over in the bible
[1:02:47] and we could see that men of god were
[1:02:49] affected by an angelic realm
[1:02:52] how that philip how that he was down
[1:02:54] there and he was preaching a revival
[1:02:56] down there in samaria
[1:02:58] but an angel of the lord came and
[1:02:59] directed him to go down to gaza
[1:03:02] and there he found a there he found a
[1:03:04] man that was
[1:03:05] studying over on the scriptures in
[1:03:07] isaiah and he said can you understand
[1:03:09] these things
[1:03:10] he said i cannot unless i be taught of
[1:03:13] these things
[1:03:14] and there philip began to preach to him
[1:03:17] and speak to him these things
[1:03:19] but you notice that you'll notice what
[1:03:21] had happened
[1:03:22] it was the angel of the lord that had
[1:03:25] directed him down there
[1:03:27] the angel knew where that eunuch would
[1:03:29] be at but that germ of life
[1:03:31] had to come through the body that germ
[1:03:34] of life
[1:03:35] as the prophet would say in spoken word
[1:03:37] as the original seed
[1:03:38] it cannot come from that of jailorgram
[1:03:40] it's got to come through the body
[1:03:44] when peter was was sent down there to
[1:03:46] cornelius's house
[1:03:47] when he was up on the rooftop and he was
[1:03:50] there and an angel
[1:03:51] angel the lord came and directed him
[1:03:54] down
[1:03:54] to cornelius's house and cornelius told
[1:03:57] him
[1:03:58] don't you be ashamed or don't you be
[1:04:00] able to be afraid to take of unclean
[1:04:02] or clean things but you see that angel
[1:04:05] knew what was going to take place
[1:04:07] but that germ that germ
[1:04:10] had to come through the body it's got to
[1:04:13] come through you and i
[1:04:14] just like when paul was on his road to
[1:04:16] damascus and there was a vision that was
[1:04:18] set before him
[1:04:19] you know what i'm talking about this
[1:04:21] morning there was a vision that was set
[1:04:22] before him
[1:04:23] and the vision directed him down to
[1:04:26] ananias's house
[1:04:28] and ananias the germ of life came
[1:04:31] through ananias
[1:04:34] whoo hallelujah hallelujah do you know
[1:04:37] this
[1:04:37] this morning that those angels were
[1:04:39] watching you that those angels knew what
[1:04:42] would be said
[1:04:44] those angels knew how you would act how
[1:04:46] you'd sit on your phone and not listen
[1:04:48] to me and
[1:04:49] how you'd fan yourself and how you get
[1:04:51] so caught up well i'm still tired
[1:04:53] i ain't got woke up but those angels
[1:04:56] knew
[1:04:57] where you'd be sitting at this morning
[1:04:59] but it takes the
[1:05:00] germ of life has to come through the
[1:05:03] body
[1:05:06] hallelujah hallelujah it was an angel
[1:05:09] that came and rolled the stone away
[1:05:11] do you realize how powerful that angelic
[1:05:14] realm is this morning
[1:05:16] that he has all power in heaven and
[1:05:19] earth has given unto him
[1:05:21] and that he is able our god i want you
[1:05:24] to know that he's an omnipotent god he's
[1:05:26] all-powerful
[1:05:27] and i want you to know that he's able
[1:05:29] this morning look at your neighbor say
[1:05:31] he's able
[1:05:33] you see the ability of god is greater
[1:05:36] than man
[1:05:37] the ability of god is greater than satan
[1:05:40] the bible said in daniel 3 and 17 that
[1:05:42] he's able to deliver
[1:05:44] in luke 3 and 8 it says that he's able
[1:05:47] to raise up
[1:05:48] children from these stones in romans 4
[1:05:50] and 21
[1:05:51] it says that he's able to fulfill these
[1:05:54] promises in second corinthians 9
[1:05:56] 8 he says that he's able to make grace
[1:05:58] abound
[1:05:59] in ephesians 3 and 20 he is able to do
[1:06:02] exceedingly abundantly above all that we
[1:06:05] could ever ask or think
[1:06:07] hallelujah in second timothy 1 and 12
[1:06:10] he's able to guard the soul's treasure
[1:06:14] hallelujah in hebrews 7 and 25 he's able
[1:06:18] to save to the uttermost
[1:06:20] hallelujah in jude 1-24 he's able to
[1:06:23] keep you from falling
[1:06:27] hallelujah well maybe i'm just going to
[1:06:29] preach to the angelic crown this morning
[1:06:31] because i don't see that i've got any
[1:06:33] humans to preach to
[1:06:34] there's nobody here that really wants
[1:06:36] what i've got this morning
[1:06:41] this realm is tangible this realm is
[1:06:44] accessible
[1:06:50] look at your neighbor and say wake up
[1:06:55] have you come to have church
[1:06:59] if i have to i can go back to the ten
[1:07:01] that enjoyed me preaching
[1:07:05] i don't mind you'd be safer at home some
[1:07:07] of you sitting there thinking that
[1:07:09] i'd be safer if i didn't have to wear
[1:07:11] this face mask at home if you're that
[1:07:13] afraid
[1:07:14] you shouldn't come here i'm not asked
[1:07:16] you are determined to make you come here
[1:07:18] this morning
[1:07:19] and you sit there all afraid you need to
[1:07:22] shake yourself
[1:07:24] you need to shake yourself this morning
[1:07:31] oh my brother branham said now how can a
[1:07:34] man
[1:07:35] how could a freezing man get worn by a
[1:07:37] painting fire
[1:07:38] how can a starving man eat from painted
[1:07:40] picture of food
[1:07:42] if god is not a man who will entice and
[1:07:44] tantalize with some painted picture
[1:07:46] what the holy ghost was in what jesus
[1:07:49] christ was then
[1:07:51] he is now just the same as he was then
[1:07:54] the same yesterday
[1:07:56] today and forever we just need that fire
[1:08:00] we realize this morning that it's the
[1:08:02] presence of god
[1:08:03] we realize that it's got to be the
[1:08:05] presence of god is essential
[1:08:07] for the supernatural to take place you
[1:08:10] and i
[1:08:10] love talking about the supernatural we
[1:08:12] love talking about those miracles
[1:08:14] but those miracles are not possible
[1:08:18] unless he is there hallelujah this year
[1:08:22] it has been our theme that god is with
[1:08:24] us and we will see miracles the reason
[1:08:27] why we will see miracles
[1:08:29] is because god is with us
[1:08:33] it's not because our friend is with us
[1:08:35] it's not because the government's behind
[1:08:37] us but because
[1:08:38] god is behind us and that the presence
[1:08:41] of god
[1:08:42] is essential for the supernatural to
[1:08:45] take place
[1:08:46] some of you are sitting here and you
[1:08:47] need back problems straightened out
[1:08:49] but i want you to know that you have
[1:08:52] showed up
[1:08:53] at the right place this morning you
[1:08:55] didn't come to a doctor's office
[1:08:57] you came to dr jesus
[1:09:01] and if you had the ability this morning
[1:09:04] you know god's got the ability
[1:09:06] but if you had the ability to reach out
[1:09:09] in faith this morning
[1:09:10] and touch the omnipotent god
[1:09:14] he's strong enough this morning
[1:09:18] you hold that thing that you need in
[1:09:20] your life the thing that you desire in
[1:09:22] your life and i want to tell you
[1:09:24] as you're holding that thing in your
[1:09:25] life that this god that i'm introducing
[1:09:28] to you
[1:09:29] is all-powerful unlimited
[1:09:32] ain't getting wore out ain't getting
[1:09:33] weak ain't getting frustrated when
[1:09:35] you're doubting
[1:09:36] he's still committed to his promise
[1:09:40] hallelujah he's the all-powerful god
[1:09:45] and it always takes the miraculous to
[1:09:47] speak of the omnipotence
[1:09:49] you see omnipotence is the all-powerful
[1:09:51] and it takes the miraculous to vindicate
[1:09:54] the omnipotence
[1:09:55] and only the miraculous can do that i
[1:09:58] teach another word is a very fine thing
[1:10:00] now faith comes by hearing and hearing
[1:10:02] the word but it always takes
[1:10:04] the miraculous to vindicate that the
[1:10:06] omnipotent
[1:10:08] still lives and reigns we must
[1:10:11] have the miraculous notice what the
[1:10:14] prophet says to you
[1:10:16] i believe that the church is now
[1:10:18] standing on the threshold
[1:10:20] of the greatest vindication of
[1:10:22] omnipotence
[1:10:23] that the world has ever known david said
[1:10:26] in psalms 72 and 18
[1:10:29] blessed be the lord god and the god of
[1:10:32] israel
[1:10:32] who only do with wondrous things
[1:10:38] only he i can't make it work
[1:10:42] you can't make it work but only he
[1:10:45] can do these wondrous things we got
[1:10:48] people that say that she's ella she
[1:10:50] and that she's eloher but you cannot
[1:10:53] make any of this word function
[1:10:55] without him
[1:11:04] we look here as our scripture we look at
[1:11:07] the prophet elijah and we look at how
[1:11:09] how his life was depicted before us and
[1:11:12] we're very familiar
[1:11:13] with the life of elijah who had many
[1:11:16] mighty miracles in his ministry
[1:11:18] and we look and we see that elijah was
[1:11:20] termed
[1:11:21] the prophet of fire and we could see how
[1:11:24] that he was
[1:11:24] how would he recall fire down from
[1:11:26] heaven but look as you look at the
[1:11:29] summary of his life
[1:11:30] that three times he was fed by divine
[1:11:33] supplies
[1:11:34] that once by ravens secondly by a widow
[1:11:37] and thirdly by angels and we so we
[1:11:40] realize that those
[1:11:41] angels that were here now were there
[1:11:44] then
[1:11:45] and that we look at these miracles you
[1:11:47] can look at them i
[1:11:48] have eight i think it's eight miracles
[1:11:50] that had transpired
[1:11:52] in the ministry of elijah and it was a
[1:11:54] double portion that was poured
[1:11:56] on elijah but we look at those miracles
[1:11:59] that were
[1:11:59] transpiring in elijah's ministry how
[1:12:02] that they were performed
[1:12:04] and you look at the time in which they
[1:12:06] were being performed at
[1:12:08] it was a time like today where men were
[1:12:10] caught up in different religions they
[1:12:12] were
[1:12:13] caught up between god worship and baal
[1:12:15] worship and serving idols
[1:12:17] and serving man but it come down to a
[1:12:20] showdown
[1:12:20] and a showdown is a test between the
[1:12:23] false
[1:12:24] and the real and i want you to know that
[1:12:26] truth always prevails
[1:12:29] truth always prevails and when it comes
[1:12:32] down to that showdown on mount carmel
[1:12:34] that their elijah he got excited and got
[1:12:38] anointed
[1:12:39] and he stood there as the worshipers of
[1:12:42] baal
[1:12:42] he said let the god that answers by fire
[1:12:46] let him be god
[1:12:48] and they stood out there and they made
[1:12:49] their sacrifice they they did all they
[1:12:51] could do and
[1:12:52] and it went all day long and elijah
[1:12:55] started making fun of them
[1:12:56] he started saying why don't you scream a
[1:12:58] little bit louder why don't you jump on
[1:13:00] your sacrifice
[1:13:01] well maybe your god's going on vacation
[1:13:05] but reality of it was is that there was
[1:13:09] no god of baal that could answer by fire
[1:13:14] but when it came elijah's turn he said
[1:13:17] pour the barrels of water on top of it
[1:13:20] now where did he get that barrel of
[1:13:22] water from
[1:13:23] when all of those 12 barrels of water
[1:13:26] when they were completely out of water
[1:13:28] in that time
[1:13:28] it was a time when elijah had the power
[1:13:32] to shut up the heavens and it did not
[1:13:34] reign for three years
[1:13:37] oh but here's to the man of god that
[1:13:39] knew where a water source was
[1:13:41] and he said go and fill up the barrels
[1:13:43] and they poured it on the sacrifice
[1:13:46] knowing that that water you no good and
[1:13:48] well you brothers
[1:13:49] that start a fire that you can't hardly
[1:13:51] get a fire started when you put a little
[1:13:53] bit of water on it much less 12 barrels
[1:13:55] of water
[1:13:57] but here god had showed up to do
[1:14:00] the omnipotence and the miraculous that
[1:14:02] was set up before him
[1:14:05] and what did god do he showed up to show
[1:14:08] that he's the only true and living god
[1:14:11] he didn't die he's still the same
[1:14:15] yesterday today
[1:14:17] and forever you see it's in the middle
[1:14:19] of a contest
[1:14:20] is when god shows up
[1:14:24] elijah the prophet of fire you can look
[1:14:26] over in the scriptures in second kings
[1:14:28] chapter one
[1:14:29] and you can see how the king of hosea
[1:14:32] how that he had
[1:14:33] fallen through the lattice and how he'd
[1:14:34] become crippled up and he sent out men
[1:14:37] to go and search out and inquire at the
[1:14:40] mouth of
[1:14:41] elizabeth to see whether he would
[1:14:43] recover or not
[1:14:44] and when these captains of 50 came out
[1:14:47] and they saw a man of the wilderness
[1:14:49] standing out there
[1:14:50] elijah was standing out there and he
[1:14:52] said is there not a god in israel
[1:14:55] that you would inquire at the mouth of
[1:14:57] baal that that your king
[1:15:00] would not recover and the fire of
[1:15:03] almighty god came down and consumed the
[1:15:06] captains of 50
[1:15:07] and he came and he did this same thing
[1:15:09] twice
[1:15:11] you got people in the land so caught up
[1:15:14] with they don't know what to do
[1:15:16] is there not a god of the message that's
[1:15:19] here to answer
[1:15:20] every single one of these questions
[1:15:27] hallelujah and elisha had watched the
[1:15:30] ministry of elijah he'd seen the power
[1:15:32] of god
[1:15:33] he'd seen the power of god come down and
[1:15:35] heard the stories and
[1:15:36] seen the miracles of the things how that
[1:15:39] elijah had worked and how that god
[1:15:41] proved that he was the only true and
[1:15:42] living god
[1:15:44] you see the the main thing is that
[1:15:47] elijah knew
[1:15:48] he knew that god was omnipotent
[1:15:52] he knew that he was omnipotent in the
[1:15:54] junction of time the prophet said but
[1:15:56] then just before that god
[1:15:58] brought the show down to show who was
[1:16:00] god there come a time that there was a
[1:16:02] prophet coming to the land by the name
[1:16:03] of elijah
[1:16:04] who was anointed with the message of god
[1:16:06] and he performed the miraculous
[1:16:08] and prove that omnipotence still was
[1:16:10] miraculous
[1:16:12] the prophet stood out there and closed
[1:16:14] the heavens that it didn't reign in the
[1:16:16] days of his ministry
[1:16:17] and he brought the reigns down out of
[1:16:19] the heavens and give earth
[1:16:20] and angels appeared on the scene
[1:16:22] hallelujah and baked him some cornbread
[1:16:25] that kept him 40 days alive while he was
[1:16:27] out there in the wilderness with god
[1:16:30] angels appear here in the end time all
[1:16:32] the prophets and the signposts point and
[1:16:34] say
[1:16:35] that this day that angels will appear
[1:16:37] prophets will arise

[1:16:57] loose oh heaven will turn loose
[1:17:00] angels appearing signs and wonders on
[1:17:02] the earth counterfeits arising
[1:17:04] god's proving which is right and wrong
[1:17:08] you ain't we me and brother alden were
[1:17:10] just standing in the back
[1:17:11] and we were talking about the percentage
[1:17:13] of believers if all were believers in
[1:17:16] virginia
[1:17:16] of the of the churches and we know of
[1:17:19] message churches
[1:17:20] we wouldn't fill out one percent
[1:17:23] one percent of virginia oh hallelujah
[1:17:27] but you are a people that is proving
[1:17:31] that there is a miraculous god
[1:17:35] you're not afraid to believe you're not
[1:17:37] afraid to ask
[1:17:38] you're not ashamed to ask he said i'm
[1:17:41] not ashamed to call you brethren
[1:17:43] and if he said that he's not ashamed of
[1:17:45] me how could i be ashamed of him
[1:17:48] [Applause]
[1:17:51] hallelujah notice this
[1:17:54] that god said when elijah was under his
[1:17:57] juniper tree he said no

[1:18:01] cook him a corn cake
[1:18:03] and set him down some water and this
[1:18:05] soft-handed angel went over
[1:18:07] and stroked the little servant of god on
[1:18:09] the brow he said remember
[1:18:13] if you've done your best god still got
[1:18:16] those angels in order
[1:18:18] he loves you just the same as he loved
[1:18:21] elijah
[1:18:23] if you've done your best church he still
[1:18:25] got angels in order
[1:18:28] oh hallelujah i wonder if somebody would
[1:18:31] say
[1:18:31] i'm giving my best i'm giving my all
[1:18:35] then god has got angels in order to take
[1:18:38] care of you
[1:18:41] i wonder if you did your best during
[1:18:42] this quarantine time
[1:18:44] i wonder if those angels were standing
[1:18:46] in order but now is the time if you
[1:18:48] weren't in order
[1:18:49] if you weren't in line if you didn't
[1:18:51] give your best

[1:19:34] promise
[1:19:35] that was his motive that was his all
[1:19:37] that was his life that was his intent
[1:19:39] everything all
[1:19:40] everything hung on getting that promise
[1:19:42] i'm persuaded
[1:19:44] to believe that we're not sincere about
[1:19:46] this thing
[1:19:47] that we're talking about if your whole
[1:19:48] motives are this morning rest
[1:19:51] upon giving god praise for my healing if

[1:20:05] i'm determined to walk in peace with god
[1:20:07] i'm determined to do it i don't care

[1:20:11] what the pastor says
[1:20:12] what anybody else says what the world

[1:20:17] that's the singleness of my heart then

[1:20:22] and then when elijah saw that he was
[1:20:24] determined to get elijah
[1:20:26] elijah saw that elisha was determined
[1:20:29] and he gave him the promise
[1:20:30] now the promise was if thou can see me
[1:20:33] when i go
[1:20:34] if you can see me when i leave it's left
[1:20:37] up to elijah
[1:20:39] he wanted to hear the promise so he's

[1:22:06] god has so perfectly planned everything
[1:22:09] out
[1:22:10] that he's committed to his purpose and
[1:22:12] he would not allow his minister
[1:22:14] to drop that germ of life to you except
[1:22:17] for at an appointed time
[1:22:20] esther you have come to this church
[1:22:23] for such a time as this
[1:22:26] this god that i'm being introduced to
[1:22:29] you today
[1:22:30] is the god of omnipotence
[1:22:38] watch these things elijah's watching how
[1:22:40] elijah acts
[1:22:44] he's watching everything that is going
[1:22:46] on in elijah's life
[1:22:50] but he's watching the god of elijah
[1:22:55] elisha knew that this was more than a
[1:22:57] man
[1:22:58] that this was more than a man that would
[1:23:00] go down there and stop this stop the
[1:23:02] reigns
[1:23:03] that this was more than a man that would
[1:23:05] that would tell
[1:23:06] tell a widow that she was going to have
[1:23:08] as i have a son
[1:23:10] that he would tell her that that you're
[1:23:12] going to live that your burial
[1:23:14] shall not be empty this was more than a
[1:23:17] man that
[1:23:18] that could stop the rain this was more
[1:23:20] than a man that could call down fire
[1:23:22] from heaven
[1:23:23] but he was watching that god this
[1:23:25] morning if you could get your eyes
[1:23:28] on him brother branham said now i wasn't
[1:23:31] the one down there at the river
[1:23:33] he said it wasn't the seventh angel it
[1:23:36] was the mighty angel
[1:23:38] he said i'm just near when he does those
[1:23:40] things
[1:23:41] oh hallelujah this morning if you could
[1:23:43] get your eyes off
[1:23:45] of the circumstances of life get your
[1:23:47] eyes off what you see
[1:23:49] and look past your thinking and watch
[1:23:51] the god
[1:23:52] of the bible
[1:24:02] he's active he's alive
[1:24:06] he's moving there's a force that is
[1:24:08] behind his word
[1:24:10] there's a force that's behind it and
[1:24:13] elijah
[1:24:14] was watching these things as he walks
[1:24:17] over with his servant elijah
[1:24:20] as he's watching as elijah crosses
[1:24:23] that river and he don't walk over on wet
[1:24:26] man
[1:24:26] let land or muddy land he walks over on
[1:24:30] dry ground
[1:24:31] elisha is watching all of these events
[1:24:34] as they're taking place
[1:24:36] that this has got to be
[1:24:39] the god of omnipotence now i have to say
[1:24:42] to you
[1:24:44] i enjoy hearing about the miracles i
[1:24:46] honestly i'll sit back and i'll listen
[1:24:47] to the prayer lines
[1:24:48] because and i'll listen to those things
[1:24:50] as they're going forth
[1:24:52] i'm not listening for i'm not listening
[1:24:55] to
[1:24:56] to glorify a man but i'm listening
[1:24:59] to watch that god of miraculous show up
[1:25:03] and discern the very thoughts and the
[1:25:05] intents of the heart
[1:25:08] these things they're available to us
[1:25:13] and though we may not be a prophet in
[1:25:15] our own ministry
[1:25:16] but there is a living word
[1:25:19] there is a living god and i believe
[1:25:21] there's a living people
[1:25:23] that are accessing that same word this
[1:25:26] morning
[1:25:28] if i didn't believe that i wouldn't be
[1:25:30] standing here
[1:25:31] but i want to tell you that these things
[1:25:33] just like you go down to the
[1:25:35] go down to food line you can go down to
[1:25:37] walmart you can go down to target you
[1:25:39] can go everywhere you want to
[1:25:41] and they may be out of toilet paper but
[1:25:43] god ain't out of his promises
[1:25:46] god ain't running out of lysol he's
[1:25:49] still got a blood
[1:25:51] he ain't running out of his elements he
[1:25:53] running out of essentials
[1:25:54] the only thing that is essential in this
[1:25:57] day
[1:25:57] is this god they got a thing called
[1:26:01] essential oil and the only essential oil
[1:26:03] that there is
[1:26:04] is the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:26:10] [Applause]
[1:26:23] you watch this scene
[1:26:29] elijah is taken up by chariots
[1:26:32] of fire and horses of fire
[1:26:37] he's caught up in a whirlwind and elisha
[1:26:41] is watching this this transpires
[1:26:44] and the mantle of elijah falls down
[1:26:48] and elijah goes over and grabs it
[1:26:55] and he walks over to the same river that
[1:26:58] they just walked across of
[1:27:01] you see because jordan means death
[1:27:04] you see elijah had walked over as one
[1:27:07] man
[1:27:08] he'd watched over watching elijah he'd
[1:27:10] watched
[1:27:11] as everything has transpired but
[1:27:13] elijah's getting ready to walk back over
[1:27:16] on the other side
[1:27:17] you see we look at the other end of the
[1:27:19] story but there is an omnipotent
[1:27:21] between this side of elisha and that
[1:27:24] side of elisha
[1:27:25] and if i can look at your lives and
[1:27:27] point out your lives
[1:27:29] i could point out that there was one
[1:27:31] there was one vj frasier
[1:27:33] but now there's another vijay phrase i
[1:27:36] could point out that there was
[1:27:38] once this stephen by ours but now
[1:27:40] there's this stephen buyers
[1:27:42] what was it there was an omnipotent god
[1:27:45] that was standing in the gap
[1:27:48] he was standing there and he's the one
[1:27:51] that made these things possible
[1:27:53] you're not here because of me you're not
[1:27:55] here because a track
[1:27:56] you're not here because of tape you're
[1:27:58] here because of him
[1:28:02] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:28:05] and he walked over and grabbed that
[1:28:06] mantle and he grabbed it
[1:28:08] and he struck the waters and he said
[1:28:11] where
[1:28:12] be the god of elijah
[1:28:20] and the second hand wrote he said but
[1:28:22] when he come down to the jordan to face
[1:28:24] the critical world what did he cry
[1:28:28] where is the god
[1:28:32] of elijah
[1:28:36] it wasn't the robe of light
[1:28:40] it wasn't the robe of elijah that dawn
[1:28:42] it it was the power of god of elijah
[1:28:45] that done it
[1:28:46] and the thing that the world needs this
[1:28:48] morning is the power of the god of a lot
[1:28:51] you might have spoke with tongues and
[1:28:53] shouted and run over the floor
[1:28:55] but what we need is the power of god of
[1:28:58] pentecost
[1:28:59] to produce the lives and things that was
[1:29:01] lived in that day in the apostolic hour
[1:29:04] that secondhand it wrote was all right
[1:29:06] but he needed a fresh call in his heart
[1:29:08] from god
[1:29:09] he needed a fresh anointing from god he
[1:29:12] was he wore a second-handed robe
[1:29:14] when he come to the river but he needed
[1:29:16] a brand new first-hand call from god
[1:29:19] and a first-handed power from god to
[1:29:21] perform the miracle
[1:29:25] now pay attention and my brother don't
[1:29:28] you be afraid to ask god anything
[1:29:31] you must demand god or ask god for
[1:29:34] anything that is promised
[1:29:36] for if i am introducing a god that's
[1:29:39] omnipotent
[1:29:40] and all-powerful and if i be a servant
[1:29:43] of god
[1:29:44] i must do the works of god and if i do
[1:29:46] the works of god
[1:29:48] i must be a man of god to bring these
[1:29:50] things to pass
[1:29:52] now this is more than your televangelist
[1:29:54] right now
[1:29:55] that is standing up the smiling preacher
[1:29:58] in texas and would stand there and said
[1:30:00] i
[1:30:00] see somebody out on the airwaves and
[1:30:02] they're dealing with a backache
[1:30:04] and they're dealing with this where you
[1:30:05] can receive your healing in the name of
[1:30:07] jesus christ
[1:30:08] but here we are watching the omnipotent
[1:30:12] god
[1:30:12] be on display if i be the servant of god
[1:30:17] then i must do the works of god and if i
[1:30:20] do the works of god
[1:30:21] i must be a man of god to bring these
[1:30:23] things to pass
[1:30:24] because he's demanding of me
[1:30:27] to produce the impossible
[1:30:32] i have to ask him i have to call upon
[1:30:34] him and stand there and say
[1:30:36] god you promised it
[1:30:40] just like you have to stand there and so
[1:30:43] it does every person you shall receive
[1:30:46] power
[1:30:47] after the holy spirit doesn't come upon
[1:30:49] you after the spirit has come upon you
[1:30:51] after you're robed as a christian after
[1:30:54] your faith is set in christ
[1:30:55] then you shall receive power there you
[1:31:00] are
[1:31:02] if i am introducing a god of omnipotence
[1:31:06] you must demand or ask god anything
[1:31:11] too long too long has men and women set
[1:31:14] back
[1:31:15] and set aside and allow their prayer
[1:31:18] list to get longer
[1:31:22] yes i'm coming to your address today
[1:31:25] too long have we sat in this church or
[1:31:27] said in message
[1:31:28] churches and we've set there and we've
[1:31:31] allowed our prayer list to get longer
[1:31:33] and instead of shorter you
[1:31:36] have the omnipotent god at your disposal
[1:31:40] this morning
[1:31:41] there is a deposit in the bank of heaven
[1:31:45] oh hallelujah instead of our prayer
[1:31:47] let's get longer
[1:31:48] let's start speaking the things that god
[1:31:51] has said
[1:31:52] let's watch the omnipotence god show up
[1:31:55] [Applause]
[1:31:57] don't you be afraid to ask you must
[1:32:00] demand god
[1:32:01] or ask god anything
[1:32:05] how many times we set back and we just
[1:32:07] allow things to go through well
[1:32:09] that's god's will i hit on it last night
[1:32:11] but i'm gonna hit on it again this
[1:32:12] morning
[1:32:13] we step back and say it's god's will for
[1:32:15] this to happen and it's god's will for
[1:32:17] that to happen
[1:32:18] that if god is willing to do it he'll do
[1:32:21] it
[1:32:22] do you realize who you are
[1:32:25] do you realize who you represent satan's
[1:32:28] not afraid of me
[1:32:30] but he is afraid of the god that i
[1:32:32] represent
[1:32:33] he don't have to mind me but he has to
[1:32:36] understand and
[1:32:37] he has to mind the god that i represent
[1:32:42] [Applause]
[1:32:43] every sickness has to mind the god
[1:32:47] that you represent
[1:32:53] well i just feel like god will do it in
[1:32:56] his time
[1:32:57] he knows how everything's going to work
[1:32:58] out he knows how things are going to
[1:33:00] transpire
[1:33:01] he's got a reason in me being sick
[1:33:05] get over that lying devil
[1:33:09] god is not willing that any should
[1:33:13] perish
[1:33:15] god is not willing that you be sick
[1:33:18] god is asking you to demand of him
[1:33:22] what he said he's not asking you to say
[1:33:26] something that he didn't say i'm
[1:33:29] preaching to you a
[1:33:30] god of omnipotence that will back up
[1:33:33] what he says
[1:33:34] that will do what he says and i believe
[1:33:38] if you can let loose of your humanity
[1:33:40] for a moment
[1:33:41] and reach out in that spiritual realm
[1:33:43] you'll realize who you are
[1:33:45] and you'll say cancer leaf sickness
[1:33:48] leave
[1:33:49] trouble leave
[1:33:52] why do we fall in love with sickness
[1:33:56] it's because people love attention
[1:34:01] i don't believe a real i now now i know
[1:34:03] that every person that gets sick does
[1:34:04] not mean that they love
[1:34:06] attention of that but there are people
[1:34:08] that enjoy being sick
[1:34:12] you say how is that possible
[1:34:15] for people to fall in love what are they
[1:34:18] falling in love with
[1:34:20] a demon
[1:34:23] you see some people are so afraid to
[1:34:25] give prayer they're afraid because
[1:34:27] if they come up the lord might actually
[1:34:29] heal them that i have to get rid of that
[1:34:30] disability check
[1:34:35] they enjoy setting back and doing
[1:34:37] nothing there's a lot of americans that
[1:34:39] have become
[1:34:40] bums over the last nine ten weeks
[1:34:43] and they have forgot what they have said
[1:34:46] it is a cuss word they have forgot
[1:34:49] w-o-r-k but i'm afraid what i'm
[1:34:52] preaching to you this morning
[1:34:54] is i'm afraid that children of god and
[1:34:57] people of god
[1:34:58] have forgotten that works
[1:35:01] is faith expressed
[1:35:04] that this is the time if there is there
[1:35:07] was a time that we need to believe
[1:35:09] in a time that we need to watch god show
[1:35:11] up it's this time
[1:35:14] we may never have meetings like we used
[1:35:16] to have we may not be able to come into
[1:35:18] service
[1:35:18] like we used to have we may not be able
[1:35:21] to do certain things
[1:35:22] but i can tell you one thing you can
[1:35:24] believe like never before
[1:35:26] i believe while we're here we can live
[1:35:28] in perfect peace
[1:35:30] while we're here we can overcome the
[1:35:31] devil we can overcome
[1:35:33] sickness we can overcome ourselves
[1:35:38] if i am introducing
[1:35:41] god of omnipotence
[1:35:46] i want to ask you something i'm going to
[1:35:48] need a little class participation on
[1:35:50] this
[1:35:51] do you believe that he introduced a god
[1:35:53] of omnipotence
[1:35:57] i'll preach to you that believe now
[1:36:00] now the bible says in 2 peter 1
[1:36:04] and 16 for we have not
[1:36:07] followed cunningly devised fables
[1:36:11] when we made known unto you the power
[1:36:14] and the coming of our lord jesus christ
[1:36:16] but were eyewitnesses of his majesty for
[1:36:20] he received from god the father
[1:36:22] honor and glory when there came such a
[1:36:24] voice from him
[1:36:25] from the excellent glory saying this is
[1:36:28] my beloved son in whom i am well pleased
[1:36:31] and this voice which came from heaven we
[1:36:34] heard
[1:36:34] when we were with him in the holy mount
[1:36:37] we have also a more
[1:36:38] sure word of prophecy whereunto
[1:36:41] you do well that you take heed as unto
[1:36:44] the light
[1:36:45] that shineth in a dark place until the
[1:36:47] day dawn and the day start arise in your
[1:36:49] hearts
[1:36:50] knowing this first that no prophecy of
[1:36:53] the scripture
[1:36:54] is of any private interpretation for the
[1:36:56] prophecy came not in old time by the
[1:36:58] will of man
[1:36:59] but holy men of god speak
[1:37:03] we are eyewitnesses of these things now
[1:37:06] i'm going to need a little bit more how
[1:37:07] many here's got the baptism of the holy
[1:37:09] ghost
[1:37:09] don't raise your hand if you ain't got
[1:37:11] it you know if you ain't got it but
[1:37:12] raise your hand if you got it
[1:37:15] all right praise the lord i'm going to
[1:37:18] give to you what a prophet said
[1:37:20] he said it's time to take this holy
[1:37:23] spirit that we're anointed with and say
[1:37:25] where is the god that was upon jesus
[1:37:27] christ
[1:37:30] come on somebody it's a time that we
[1:37:34] take this holy spirit that we're
[1:37:36] anointed with
[1:37:37] and said where is the god that was upon
[1:37:40] jesus christ
[1:37:42] he said the works that i do shall you do
[1:37:45] also
[1:37:46] you believe that's for you if you
[1:37:48] believe that's for you you have access
[1:37:50] to it
[1:37:51] you ought to take that holy spirit that
[1:37:53] you're anointed with and say where is
[1:37:55] the god that was upon jesus christ
[1:37:57] and you watch the same works that he did
[1:38:00] you'll do
[1:38:02] and greater works than these shall you
[1:38:04] do because i go into my father
[1:38:06] that if you ask anything in my name i
[1:38:08] will do it
[1:38:18] there was a time
[1:38:22] there was a time
[1:38:26] when the prophet was standing at the
[1:38:28] platform
[1:38:30] he's standing there and there's this
[1:38:33] little baby he's holding in his arms
[1:38:36] it's all crippled up his feet's all
[1:38:38] drawn up
[1:38:39] arms all drawed up
[1:38:44] brother branham said no i thought the
[1:38:48] janitor turned the light on and shined
[1:38:49] it in my face and he said i kind of
[1:38:50] thought
[1:38:51] well that's kind of rude of a person to
[1:38:54] do a thing like that
[1:38:56] he said but as i watched i realized that
[1:38:58] it wasn't a janitor that was doing that
[1:39:00] but that was the angel of the lord that
[1:39:02] was a pillar of fire that was coming he
[1:39:04] said now i don't know what happened
[1:39:07] he said i don't know where i dropped the
[1:39:08] baby or not or whether it jumped down my
[1:39:10] arms
[1:39:11] he said but when that baby hit the floor
[1:39:14] its arms went straight out and his feet
[1:39:17] went straight out
[1:39:19] and there was and it started running
[1:39:21] across that altar
[1:39:22] and it ran over and grabbed a hold of
[1:39:24] its mama and there was a lady that was
[1:39:26] over there
[1:39:27] there was a nazarene woman that was over
[1:39:28] there playing a piano that the great
[1:39:30] physician now was near
[1:39:31] the sympathizing jesus is here and as
[1:39:34] she seen that event taking place
[1:39:36] she watched she watched as that was
[1:39:39] transpiring
[1:39:40] and that lady that sister jumped off off
[1:39:42] of that piano
[1:39:44] and started shouting and speaking in
[1:39:45] tongues right there
[1:39:47] but the whole time the piano kept
[1:39:49] playing
[1:39:50] the great physician now is near what was
[1:39:53] it the god that was a healing
[1:39:55] is the god that knows how to play the
[1:39:56] piano and the god that is preaching this
[1:39:59] morning
[1:40:00] is the god that knows how to receive he
[1:40:02] knows how to open up
[1:40:03] he knows how to open up a red sea he
[1:40:06] knows how to open up a jordan river
[1:40:08] and he knows how to get a hold of your
[1:40:09] life he knows how to come to your
[1:40:11] address
[1:40:12] he knows how to speak to you on a level
[1:40:14] that nobody else can speak to you
[1:40:16] because you have a capacity to be able
[1:40:18] to receive
[1:40:19] like nobody else you're the bride of
[1:40:22] jesus christ the world can't receive it
[1:40:25] unbelief can't receive it but the bride
[1:40:27] of jesus christ
[1:40:28] that knows where she stands knows what
[1:40:30] she's doing
[1:40:31] no she's called to this hour has the
[1:40:33] capacity to be able to receive thus
[1:40:36] saith the lord
[1:40:37] and watch that word come to pass she's
[1:40:40] not afraid
[1:40:41] she's not ashamed she's not shook up
[1:40:45] she's watching what he said
[1:40:52] there was a man that died one time there
[1:40:54] was a man that died one time and
[1:40:56] mother branham went over he went over to
[1:40:58] pay and offer his sympathy to the family
[1:41:02] he walked in there and there was a
[1:41:04] methodist preacher and
[1:41:05] his wife sitting there he's sitting
[1:41:08] there and brother brandon walks in and
[1:41:09] offers his sympathy to him
[1:41:12] and he said he started walking out the
[1:41:13] door got out on front front
[1:41:15] porch stood out there and he said a
[1:41:17] man's hand grabbed a hold of him
[1:41:18] and he said i turned around and there
[1:41:20] was no man there he said so i walked
[1:41:22] back on the inside of that house
[1:41:24] and he said well i walked over to that
[1:41:25] bedside and he said i begin
[1:41:28] he said i begin to pray now i wonder
[1:41:30] what this methodist preacher thought of
[1:41:31] this
[1:41:33] he was getting ready to watch an event
[1:41:36] that he had probably ever seen maybe
[1:41:37] never ever see again
[1:41:39] but here brother branham said i guess
[1:41:41] i'll just offer prayer he said the next
[1:41:43] thing i know when i came to myself
[1:41:45] i was saying brother elijah he said i
[1:41:47] was laying on top of that dead man's
[1:41:50] body
[1:41:50] and he said i was sitting there saying
[1:41:52] brother elijah
[1:41:54] brother elijah brother elijah he said
[1:41:56] there was a dead man underneath of that
[1:41:58] sheet

[1:42:01] around that sheet
[1:42:02] what was it he was introducing to you a
[1:42:05] god of omnipotence a god that backs up
[1:42:09] what he said

[1:42:40] her

[1:44:48] who is this one that is moving us
[1:44:51] you see elisha was a witness of what the
[1:44:54] power of god could do
[1:44:57] and he walked down there and smote the
[1:44:58] waters and he says where be the god of
[1:45:01] elijah
[1:45:03] where be the god of elijah this morning
[1:45:06] i want you to ask a question
[1:45:07] where is the god of elijah at
[1:45:12] if he's the omnipotent god where's that
[1:45:14] god at
[1:45:16] you see he was a witness and we are
[1:45:18] witnesses
[1:45:19] that the lame can walk that the blind
[1:45:22] can see
[1:45:23] that the dead can raise sister jenny
[1:45:27] you weren't here that night i don't i
[1:45:28] don't recall that you were here but your
[1:45:30] father
[1:45:31] as far as i'm concerned was a dead man
[1:45:34] sitting in that pew
[1:45:36] everything was a holy hush at that
[1:45:38] moment you'll hear some of these things
[1:45:40] in the upcoming weeks
[1:45:42] but there brother doug hill you were
[1:45:44] sitting here
[1:45:45] and you watched as the whole
[1:45:47] congregation was under a holy hush
[1:45:51] that was your daddy how was your daddy
[1:45:55] that was your father-in-law
[1:46:01] what if he didn't show up
[1:46:05] we'd had a nice funeral we'd said great
[1:46:08] words
[1:46:09] because i believe great words should be
[1:46:10] said over a great man but i'm ever so
[1:46:13] glad that i didn't have to preach
[1:46:14] brother dog's funeral
[1:46:16] what you're looking at today as far as
[1:46:19] i'm concerned
[1:46:20] is a dead man that's been raised back
[1:46:22] from the life
[1:46:26] now you can tell me all you want to and
[1:46:29] the religions of the world
[1:46:30] and people and even what they call my
[1:46:33] friends have tried to tell me
[1:46:35] that this god don't do those things no
[1:46:37] more if you're trying to tell me that
[1:46:40] you're not my friend but i'm a proof
[1:46:43] and i'm a witness that this omnipotent
[1:46:46] god
[1:46:47] lives rules and reigns i've looked at
[1:46:49] your life
[1:46:50] i looked at these miracles and this is
[1:46:53] none other than jesus christ
[1:46:54] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:47:06] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:47:13] hallelujah
[1:47:19] you believe that angel's here this
[1:47:20] morning
[1:47:23] you know he's got angels that are
[1:47:24] commissioned with healing
[1:47:29] i believe there's an angel i believe
[1:47:31] there's an angel watching over you
[1:47:35] it's watching over your situation
[1:47:38] you believe that i believe there's an
[1:47:40] angel of healing that is commissioned by
[1:47:42] almighty god
[1:47:44] we watch that angel work in this day
[1:47:46] like no other day
[1:47:48] we see more miracles that happen in this
[1:47:50] day than what even happened in the life
[1:47:51] of jesus christ
[1:47:53] because these are the greater works
[1:47:56] not greater in quality but greater in
[1:47:58] quantity we are watching the same jesus
[1:48:01] that walk the shores of galilee
[1:48:03] that walked down there and healed a
[1:48:04] leper we've seen that same god raise a
[1:48:07] man that had every vertebrae in his back
[1:48:09] broke
[1:48:10] i've watched that god i've watched that
[1:48:13] god when doctors told me
[1:48:14] when they doctors told me that he'll
[1:48:16] never preach again
[1:48:17] and they told me that he'll never be
[1:48:19] able to walk again i've watched that
[1:48:21] same god say
[1:48:22] or the same devil say that that he'll
[1:48:24] never be able to work like he used to
[1:48:27] i've heard doctors say that he won't be
[1:48:29] able to function like he used to
[1:48:30] i've heard all kinds of things but i've
[1:48:33] watched an omnipotent god
[1:48:35] show up show up
[1:48:38] show up and i've watched him get the
[1:48:41] glory
[1:48:42] there's not one man that stood behind
[1:48:44] this pulpit
[1:48:45] that's tried to get the glory because we
[1:48:48] wouldn't have let a man that would want
[1:48:49] to give
[1:48:50] his own glory stand behind this pulpit
[1:48:52] but there's not been one man stood here
[1:48:55] and preached the living message of jesus
[1:48:57] christ that wanted to get the glory for
[1:48:58] himself
[1:48:59] but you watched as that minister of god
[1:49:02] dropped the germ of life and you watch
[1:49:05] the miraculous take place
[1:49:08] hallelujah if
[1:49:12] we are introducing a god of omnipotence
[1:49:15] then
[1:49:16] the miraculous has got to vindicate it
[1:49:26] he's got to vindicate it
[1:49:29] i believe those angels are here i
[1:49:32] believe those angels are moving
[1:49:34] i believe what we've introduced to you
[1:49:36] is a god of all power
[1:49:39] we watched as moses would stand there
[1:49:43] and he would
[1:49:44] he would instruct the children of israel
[1:49:47] to look on that brass serpent
[1:49:49] now it was not the brass it was what it
[1:49:52] represented but there was an angel
[1:49:54] there was an angel of healing there just
[1:49:57] like it was an angel of healing
[1:49:58] down by the pool of bethesda that was
[1:50:01] there there was an angel that was on
[1:50:03] that water it was not the water
[1:50:05] it was the angel and it is not the man
[1:50:08] it's the angel these things that we tell
[1:50:12] you today
[1:50:13] this is the lord's doing
[1:50:20] there's elements in your life that i
[1:50:23] can't describe
[1:50:24] publicly but you know
[1:50:29] that if he didn't show up
[1:50:32] there were certain things that wouldn't
[1:50:34] happen
[1:50:36] you'd be stuck in that condition and
[1:50:38] you'd be far off
[1:50:41] but god was so strong
[1:50:59] i've watched i've watched
[1:51:02] miraculous in front of my very own eyes
[1:51:09] i've watched
[1:51:12] i've watched as men that
[1:51:15] were separated by thousands of miles
[1:51:19] and i'll watch the miraculous take place
[1:51:23] i've watched that same god in action and
[1:51:34] i want to tell you what you're seeing in
[1:51:35] the natural
[1:51:36] is what you're going to see in
[1:51:37] supernatural
[1:51:41] that we're in a battle right here this
[1:51:43] morning there is
[1:51:44] major war that is going on but i want to
[1:51:46] tell you
[1:51:48] that we are winning
[1:51:52] i've watched that same angel of the lord
[1:51:55] come
[1:51:56] some people criticize it what they want
[1:51:58] to say what they want to and say we
[1:52:00] shouldn't preach these things
[1:52:04] but i believe i believe what he said
[1:52:10] that your young men
[1:52:13] shall see visions and your old men
[1:52:16] should dream dreams
[1:52:19] i've watched his visions come to pass in
[1:52:21] front of you
[1:52:23] i've been behind the scenes and i've
[1:52:25] watched the supernatural
[1:52:29] many of you don't even know it many of
[1:52:31] things will never be said to you
[1:52:34] and they can criticize me it's on the
[1:52:35] internet they can criticize me they can
[1:52:37] make fun
[1:52:39] they can say what they want to but i'm
[1:52:42] going to tell you when he says it when
[1:52:43] god says it
[1:52:45] it always comes to pass
[1:52:48] you see it's a major difference when i
[1:52:50] say it or when i
[1:52:51] maybe feel an impulse because what he
[1:52:54] said but when he says it
[1:52:56] there are things that have come out of
[1:52:58] these mortal lifts and i thought oh god
[1:53:00] if you don't back that up
[1:53:02] if you don't back that up if that was me
[1:53:04] i will be exposed
[1:53:06] as just another ordinary man but i
[1:53:09] realize that i
[1:53:10] yielded myself a long time ago to his
[1:53:14] sovereign will and i've watched his
[1:53:17] visions that were told in the background
[1:53:20] and you had no clue what would take
[1:53:22] place standing back there in that back
[1:53:24] office
[1:53:25] there would be things said that would
[1:53:27] transpire during a service
[1:53:28] like this morning and i'd sit in that
[1:53:32] seat right there
[1:53:33] and i'd watch it perfectly come to pass
[1:53:36] now who is that is that ron spencer
[1:53:40] is that the god of omnipotence
[1:53:44] hallelujah i'm just saying brother ron
[1:53:46] never stood here
[1:53:47] and tried to produce his own ministry
[1:53:50] and tried to stand there and say
[1:53:52] that these visions were of himself
[1:53:54] brother ron spencer stood behind this
[1:53:56] pulpit
[1:53:57] on thus saith the lord and by his
[1:53:59] perfect will
[1:54:00] almighty god's will said that this
[1:54:03] vision
[1:54:04] has said this and as far as i'm
[1:54:06] concerned sister anna
[1:54:08] the baby's already coming
[1:54:10] [Applause]

[1:54:18] be grandma again
[1:54:19] cause the baby's coming the vision's
[1:54:21] coming
[1:54:23] there was a vision years ago years ago
[1:54:26] that brother homer brother ron and
[1:54:29] brother andrew
[1:54:30] would lead this church right into the
[1:54:32] rapture and i've got to tell you
[1:54:34] that the vision is going to come to pass
[1:54:39] there ain't going to be no hell there
[1:54:41] ain't going to be no spirit of disease
[1:54:43] going to stop us from going in this
[1:54:46] rapture
[1:54:48] there's a god on my side there's a god
[1:54:50] that's backing us up
[1:54:51] there's a god of omnipotence
[1:54:56] the vision has been spoken
[1:55:08] oh glorify the lord with me come exalt
[1:55:12] his name together
[1:55:15] why stay there in that condition
[1:55:18] say where is the god that was upon jesus
[1:55:21] christ
[1:55:24] stop sitting there in that condition
[1:55:26] start speaking
[1:55:28] start moving start acting
[1:55:32] oh if you just fall in love with jesus
[1:55:38] if you just fall in love with his will
[1:55:42] he'll do his part
[1:55:48] there's ah there's a lot of parents are
[1:55:50] sitting here and the musicians can come
[1:55:53] there's a lot of parents sitting here
[1:55:56] and sometimes you don't even mean to do
[1:55:57] it but sometimes in your own parenthood
[1:56:00] you show favoritism over one child or
[1:56:02] the other
[1:56:03] you don't mean to do it it just happens
[1:56:07] maybe you'll give a little more piece of
[1:56:08] candy to this one or a little piece of
[1:56:10] candy to that one
[1:56:12] that's my favorite one you don't mean to
[1:56:14] do it sometimes that's just what parents
[1:56:16] do sometimes
[1:56:17] it's what you're closest to why'd you
[1:56:20] give her that why didn't you give me
[1:56:21] that why did you do that why'd you do
[1:56:22] this why'd you do that
[1:56:23] sometimes you just do things like that
[1:56:25] and you show favoritism you didn't mean
[1:56:27] to do it
[1:56:28] but parents show favoritism sometimes
[1:56:32] but god never does and if you come to
[1:56:35] him the same way
[1:56:37] that the widow of nain came if you come
[1:56:39] to him the same way that that dirty
[1:56:41] leper
[1:56:42] came to him came if you come to him the
[1:56:44] same way that the one with the blood as
[1:56:46] you came
[1:56:47] you see you'll get the same results
[1:56:50] you'll get the same results because you
[1:56:52] see god
[1:56:54] will back up his part if you'll do your
[1:56:57] part
[1:56:59] i'll give the lord praise
[1:57:15] where is the god that was upon jesus
[1:57:18] christ
[1:57:20] he's here he's
[1:57:24] here
[1:57:27] now i don't know specifically
[1:57:30] god don't tell me everything and god
[1:57:32] don't show me everything
[1:57:35] i don't know exactly why god would allow
[1:57:39] just this word to be released in this
[1:57:41] moment
[1:57:44] but i want you to be sensitive as a
[1:57:45] people
[1:57:48] to understand that
[1:57:52] are certain things as i as a man would
[1:57:53] love to preach
[1:57:55] i enjoy to preach but god had a reason
[1:57:59] in holding this off so i don't want you
[1:58:02] to think of myself
[1:58:03] or think of anything but i want you to
[1:58:05] think about the element of god
[1:58:08] that god would wait at such a season to
[1:58:11] deposit this
[1:58:13] that god would place this in your lap at
[1:58:16] this time
[1:58:17] now you'll walk out of those doors and
[1:58:19] you'll go have your sunday dinner
[1:58:24] but what will you do with this will it
[1:58:26] go through your mind i want you to eat
[1:58:27] i want you to eat on these things your
[1:58:29] children have heard these things your
[1:58:31] children are understanding more than
[1:58:32] maybe
[1:58:33] what you understand or what you even
[1:58:34] think they're catching
[1:58:37] there's going to be some questions that
[1:58:39] will come up in your children's life
[1:58:42] and it's this god that will answer
[1:58:47] want you to reflect on these things and
[1:58:49] realize
[1:58:51] that god had a purpose he had to bring
[1:58:54] you to this spot
[1:58:55] this spot in your life to be able to
[1:58:58] release
[1:58:59] a certain situation you see because the
[1:59:02] bible said that he had a need to go by
[1:59:03] samaria
[1:59:05] he's got a need this morning to speak
[1:59:08] these things so specifically
[1:59:10] in such in a manner
[1:59:13] that he turned the diamond just enough
[1:59:16] so you could see him this morning
[1:59:19] don't see me don't see brother ron don't
[1:59:21] see brother homer don't see this church
[1:59:25] see jesus because i'm gonna fade away
[1:59:29] that gray hair keeps coming in faster
[1:59:30] and then i can
[1:59:32] count them but if time terries
[1:59:37] i'm going to leave here maybe down in
[1:59:40] the future some
[1:59:41] if time would tear i don't think we got
[1:59:43] much longer i really don't
[1:59:47] i see i see nothing that is left to be
[1:59:50] undone
[1:59:50] except for the change of the body but if
[1:59:53] time would tarry
[1:59:55] and go down the road there'll be some
[1:59:56] other man standing behind this pulpit
[2:00:01] but don't see the man don't see me
[2:00:04] don't see sister cassie don't see
[2:00:06] brother matthew that they're playing
[2:00:07] their parts
[2:00:08] see jesus that is
[2:00:12] you see if you'll fall in love with
[2:00:13] jesus
[2:00:16] it'll take care of everything this ain't
