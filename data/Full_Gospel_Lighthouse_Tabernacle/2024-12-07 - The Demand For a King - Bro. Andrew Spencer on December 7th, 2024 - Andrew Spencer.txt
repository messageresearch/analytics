presence has been felt this atmosphere is charged and demons are running for cover because there is a people that do know their God and these people are strong they know their God and they shall do exploits so father tonight we commit this service into your hand we ask that you would come amongst us that you would be the one that is high and lifted up Lord from every person here that is fighting

children's heart I pray that you would just come Lord and you take a little bitty country boy and move him over to the side and you would allow Lord my vessel to be used of the Holy Spirit tonight to speak to your people Lord I don't want to hinder them I don't want to hinder myself and I don't want to hinder the kingdom of God so father I yield my vessel to you I have sacrificed my life I've I've prepared my heart and now I pray Lord that you would just bring to fruition the things that you have in store for us Lord we are very hungry but Lord they that are hungry they shall be filled so we invite you Lord Jesus to come and break the bread of life just now let me get out of the way so that you can do a good job in this place in Jesus name we pray amen amen if you have your Bibles this evening would like to look over in the Old Testament 1st Samuel chapter 8 verse one 1st Samuel chapter 8 verse one and then John chapter 18 Hallelujah 1 Samuel chapter 8 verse 1 and it came to pass when Samuel was old that he made his sons judges over Israel now the name of his firstborn was Joel and the name of his second abah they were judges in beerseba and his sons walked not in his ways but turned aside after lucer and took bribes and perverted judgment then all the Elders of Israel gathered themselves together and came to Samuel unto Rama and said unto him behold Thou Art old and thy Sons walk not in thy ways now make us a king to judge us like all the nations but the thing displeased Samuel when they said give us a king to judge us and Samuel prayed unto the Lord and the Lord said unto Samuel hearken unto the voice of the people and all that they say unto thee for they have not rejected thee but they have rejected me that I should not Reign Over them John chapter 18 and verse 33 then pilate entered into the Judgment Hall again and called Jesus and said unto him art thou the king of the Jews Jesus answered him sayest thou this thing of thyself or did others tell it thee of me pilate answered am I a Jew thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me what hast thou done and Jesus answered my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight that I should not be delivered to the Jews but now is my kingdom not from hence and pilate said pilate therefore said unto him art thou a king then Jesus answered thou sayest that I am a king to this end was I born and for this cause came I into the world that I should bear witness unto the truth everyone that is of Truth heareth my voice may God bless his word you may be seated tonight in the presence of the Lord and by the help of the Lord tonight I would like to I would like to speak to you on a thought on the demand for a king the demand for a king and we we realize and we see that the Bible teaches us and we're this a very familiar scripture that even the prophet would preach a text from this that the Bible said in Proverbs 3 and 5 trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding and in all thy ways acknowledge Him and He Shall direct thy paths and we'd like to just take a little thought and maybe just build build a little thought here tonight to lay some ground for some future thoughts that the Lord has dealt with us on on this thought on the demand for the king and we realize that when people demand Earthly Solutions without trusting God that they often miss God's perfect will and we find that throughout all throughout the Old Testament you see it you see it predominately when men begin to trust in their own leadership and when they begin to trust in their own integrity that you would begin to see people fall and you would begin to see people you would begin to see people that would lean upon them and you'll watch when people begin to lean on their own understanding that men will begin to adopt the ideas of other religions because they find that their religion has no power in it but what really happened is they got away of the truth of the hour and you find that when you study out the Book of Judges and just to go back and maybe maybe just lay some of these things in here you'll find that you you find a shift of power from the Book of Judges all the way to 1st Samuel chapter 8 you'll watch that that Samuel was one that Samuel was one of the rulers or one of the judges over over Israel but you'll find that there is a shift of power that that men were you you'll see it that men were leaning on the judges they were leaning on these rulers that were over top of Israel and even under Divine leadership of prophets they were they were leaning on that and then you begin to watch the transition from from the the judges then you begin to watch it as it transitions over into the leadership of of monarchy where a king would rule over them and just to gather the state that Israel was in here that you would begin to see all the way from the Book of Judges there they come in and they they don't kick out there a lot there's a few of them that do not kick out the inhabitants of the land and they begin to adopt in and they begin to worship false gods and bring in idol worship and different things and just to see where where Israel was in that time they were experiencing a very turbulent time here and you it's very characterized as we look in the church ages you'll see it that it's a repeated cycle of sin and death and Revival of fire of Oppression and and repentance and then deliverance and and back and forth you constantly watch those Cycles as they're repeated and you can watch the periods as as it's highlighted through the Book of Judges and you can see is will struggle there as they're struggling there to remain faithful to God because they have adopted all of these ideas of worshiping of idols and and idol worship but right in the midst of the judges they are when they begin to adopt they begin to adopt these Canaanite was Canaanite practices and cycles of apostasy as they would come in the the Book of Judges is summed up in this that men would do it's said in judges 21-25 that men would do what was right in their own eyes and you watch as as the church Ages was roll out you watch throughout the seven Church ages without the leadership of the Holy Ghost you will watch as men begin to do as their own minds sought to do and they they thought they would do it their own way but they were lacking a very powerful leader which was the person of Jesus Christ himself but you watch right in the midst of right in the midst of the judges right in the midst of the seven Church ages right between judges and Samuel there is a beautiful book that is placed right smack in the middle of it it's the Book of Ruth and you watch how how the children of Israel they were they were Jewish in their descent in their lineage and they were called the people of almighty God and here's a woman that that is Gentile in her descent she's a moabitas she knows what it's like to worship false gods she knows what it's like to worship idols but here's this woman she remains faithful to God and you study out the Book of Ruth you will see Ruth as she's making her decision you will see Ruth in her deciding and her and her serving then you will see Ruth resting and then you'll see Ruth rewarded it's it's a powerful thing when you studyed out that all the way from Men's Leadership right there God smacks a bride right in the middle of it and it shows that there is a coming King that is a people that are set up they are set up for kingship because God has going to have somebody that is going to prepare away so that he could have a lineage by the name of David a davidic lineage because he had to have somebody that was going to be faithful to God even when they seemed like nobody else was being faithful God had a woman when the church world wasn't faithful to God when the denominations wasn't faithful to God when the when the Bishops wasn't faithful to God there was a little bitty old woman she may only had a storefront church but when she was that kind of a woman that had the kind of relationship though she'd never seen God though she never felt God she hadn't even taken of the Mana but there was something on the inside of this little woman that was calling for her I would call it predestination that was leading her to the position that she was supposed to stand in and then you see be a very powerful woman stepping into the scriptures she may not seem powerful but she's very powerful this woman is without child she's she's not able to have she's not able to bring forth children and men are mocking her because she's not able to bring forth a child the people that are closest to her are mocking her because she cannot produce so Hannah begins to pray and Hannah begins to worship and she goes up before the priest and she gets so under the atmosphere of prayer that Hannah begins to act like a drunk woman she so drunk under the influence of this prayer that Hannah is moved by the Holy Ghost that the priest sees her and thinks and thinks that she's so drunk but she was not drunk because she was stammering on strong wine but her prayer had become so prolific to her that she could only stammer she could only sit there under the influence of the Holy Ghost you say what would make Hannah pray that kind of a prayer to move her into that kind of position because if Hannah does not pray then a Samuel is not produced so Hannah had to get in this kind of a condition where she couldn't have a child so that she could set up a prophetic world that would transition the Israelites from judges to a true davidic kingship and you wonder why you're in the condition that you are it's because God is wanting you to pray because he is going to be king let me just go ahead and say that God is going to be king over your finances God is going to be king over your prayer life he is going to be king over every sin he will be king over every doubt he will be king over every demon and Samuel was set up as a leadership as the last judge and a prophet Samuel L Israel in spiritual renewal and great victories and it's amazing to see that quickly how quickly as the prophetic the prophetic is set up that the children of Israel begin to lean on this prophetic they begin to lean on his on his gift they begin to lean on everything that Samuel would say and they had got away from the they had got away from true worship but a real Prophet will set up true worship in spirit and in truth and when Samuel comes to them in 1st Samuel chapter 7 he comes in there and he restores through worship he comes back there and kills he kills a sacrifice sets up an army sets up an altar and God the Bible said that God thundered out a great Victory because these things were set up and immediately it's a quick it's amazing how quickly that the children of God can forget how powerful that their God is you see well that's not possible it's a I'm a real I'm the part I'm a part of the Bride of Jesus Christ I see the supernatural but you get sick one time in your body you start to get that feeling in your head well maybe it's not just a headache am I talking to you maybe maybe it's tumors maybe it's cancer maybe it's this and all of a sudden you begin to doubt what God did Even though last weekend he did something Supernatural but how quickly the enemy comes in there and robs you of how great the god that is your king he'll immediately come in there and immediately they begin to ask they begin to demand a king they have seen God split the Seas they have seen God stop the sun they have seen God they have seen God do all the miraculous even in Gideon's life they saw the miraculous even in Deborah's life they saw the miraculous even in Samson's life they saw the miraculous but these people were demanding a king and the reason why these people's desire had got so demanding was it had stemmed from the very thought they had rejected God's rulership they had rejected his direct Rule and they were it was reflecting of the lack of the trust that they had in almighty God and just to lay this here in in 1 Samuel chapter 8 you I'm not just going to bounce and hit the highlights real you see God's instruction to Samuel after he hears this He commands the people of God to listen to him that he he he gives him a solemn instruction and he forars him that this is going to be the consequences of what happens if you if you have a king So Samuel warns the people from the Lord that this man's going to be a military man he's going to take your sons he's going to put them in an army he'll put them over chariots and Horsemen and Runners he will set up military leadership he will put your daughters in labor he will Seize Your Land and all of your resources he will take he will take a tenth of your grain and your Vineyards and set up taxes he will set up the the best of enslavement servants and take your best animals he will put a tax on your best livestock and there's going to come a time that you are going to get to a spot that you will literally cry out in regret for praying for a king but the people were so stubborn that they refused the leadership of the Holy Ghost and even though they knew the consequences of what was coming they demanded a king you see what God was saying to them if you do this you are going to lose your freedoms right the prophet said in the rejected King he said and this he said and this seemed to be that Israel wanted to pattern themselves like these Kings like these people he said but it has never been in any age God's intentions for his people to act like the people of the world or to be governed or controlled like the people of the world God's people is always a peculiar people or a different people or a called out people or a separated people and all allog together different in their actions in their ways in their manner of living that's what the people of the world has you see by your actions you choose who you are making King when you choose to skip church you are choosing who your king is when you choose to deny God the tenth of your of your sacrifice you are choosing who your king is I'm not looking at you for a reason but when you choose to worship the idols of leosia more more than the King of Kings you are choosing who your king is but there is something powerful about men and women that choose to be like the true and living example the one that gave up his very life he set up his kingship before the foundation of the world and when he got here he said I must be about my father's business the world constantly wants to be like this one or be like that one but ask for me I want to be like Jesus you see no matter how much Samuel tried to persuade the people continually they went out to him day and night and said we want a king and the prophet said he said it's a very much a parallel of to today because that man seems to have that same idea they don't seem to be able to grasp that that God still rules man instead of man ruling man I pray you forgive me I was out in that wind just just a few minutes and it seemed to wipe my voice this week it's the same thing today men look on the outside instead of the inside because they wanted to be exactly like the amots and the Philistines they had looked out there and they had saw what Le osia had and they wanted it for their own they seen how everybody else worshiped and they was able to get by with cutting off their skirts and bringing them up a little bit higher and trimming their hair and able to get by and call it worship you see they wanted that kind of worship ship but they didn't realize when they were accepting that kind of a worship they were rejecting not Samuel not William pranam but they were rejecting the king so they wanted the biggest church they wanted the finest Scholars so they picked out a Saul brother mam said he was a seven foot kind of a man had dark hair grease back he said he was he was that kind of a guy he said he was super handsome he said but when it come to what God picked out it was a little bitty old Ruddy red hited boy red hitted boy that was made man after his own heart because he when he was setting up the davidic kingship he stood there before all of Jess's sons and said man looks on the outward appearance but God looks on on the heart and there's a lot of people in a lot of churches today had said serve God serve God from your heart just follow your heart and it'll always come out right that is not scriptural by what by no means you follow the word and you'll come out right you follow your heart the heart is a deceitful thing and the heart will rob you of what God has for you [Music] you see the reason why David was a man after God's Own Heart was because God had deposited something before David was ever born of Jesse he was born a king you see a prophet does not go into and develop develop the abilities to become a prophet gifts and callings are without repentance David was born a king he did not join into a King's family even though he married Saul's daughter but the reason why David could become king was because God set him up you see the reason why you are a people after God's Own Heart it's what he put on the inside of you you may not look like the biggest church you may not have the most profound ways of speaking things but God has predestinated you and ordained you against all ODS he knew that you would stand here he knew that you may not be beautiful you may not be handsome you may not be the most smartest but you were his when our King came he was despised and rejected of men and there was no beauty that we should desire him when he stood there the Pharisees even though he was 30 years old the Pharisees thought he had so much pressure on him they deemed him to be a man about the age of 50 because the prees of your sin was upon this King you don't realize this but ever since the garden you you have been demanding a king now brother random said this in a in church age he said just as the early church started out under the pure Ministry of the holy spirit with signs and wonders and manifestations such as prophecy and tongues and interpretation wisdom and knowledge and healing and so in the days of Israel when they left Egypt they were under the leadership of the spirit of God manifesting in gifts God was the leader of the people actually he was their King he was a father King he took care of Israel like a man takes care of his family he fed them he fought their battles he smoothed away their difficulties and settled their problems he just busied himself over them and they were only a nation they were the only nation to which he was truly God but one day they got to looking around and they saw the Philistines over and the other nations was Kings over them and it caught their eyes and they decided that they ought to humanize their leadership so they wanted a king he said now God was going to humanize the leadership himself in the in the person of the Lord Jesus Christ but they got ahead of him you see Satan knew the plan of God so he put it in the hearts of the people to get ahead of the word you see Satan will put it in your heart to get ahead of the plan of God you know somebody you see it on their life that they are elected you can see the Holy Spirit working on them but don't you clean them up let him clean them up God did not set up humans to clean humans he set up the Holy Spirit to bring in Sons and Daughters of God the humanizing of the leadership is our Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the name of the Lord God knows who is and God know who isn't so let him be God I say this unto you your children will receive the Holy Ghost but let him give it you will receive your healing but let him work it you are in position for your Miracle but stand fast in the faith don't put it on brother Ron don't put it on brother Tim don't put it on one of these brothers laying their hands on you put it back in the hands of Jesus that's the problem with so many marriages they have taken their marriage and put it in their own hands and they took it out of the hand of God it's time that you revisit your vows when you were standing there before God and all of these Witnesses it's time that you put your marriage back in the hands of God it's time that you put your business back in the hands of God it's time you put your finances back how tragic that was little did they realize I tell you what I'm going get the devil he Afflicted my voice I might have to preach this again so it's so it's real profound for you but I I'm going get the devil he said how tragic that was that little little did they know or realize that when they were asking God to let them be like the rest of the world they were rejecting him because God had ordained or ordained that his people act different from the world they're not of the world they don't look like the world they don't act like the world they are crucified under the world and the world is crucified under them because the Bible said in 2 Corinthians 6:17 wherefore come out from amongst them and be ye separate save the Lord and touch not their unclean thing and I will receive you and I'll be my be a father unto you you be my sons and daughters sayith the Lord Almighty you see the difference between Israel and the rest of the Nations was God you put God to one side and Israel was like any other Nation when Samson cut off his hair he was like any other man you put the leadership of the Holy Ghost aside and the church is nothing but the world with God's name attached to it you could take Samson he was just a little bitty old guy but let the spirit of God get on him and he could tie up foxes he could destroy a thousand Philistines but without that power he was helpless and so are you if you move without the holy Spirit you're helpless if you act without the Holy Spirit you're helpless if you dance without the Holy Spirit you're dancing in the wrong but if you worship with the Holy Ghost then your worship is right if you dance with the Holy Ghost then you're dancing is right the world and the church are all of the same lump just like Jacob and Esau were of the same parents but the spirit of God makes the difference you see sisters that wear wear a Holiness standard but the difference between you and them is a spirit of God there are a lot of people there are a lot of women that do not cut their hair because they read it in the Bible but the difference between you and them is the spirit of God there's a lot of men that are still men that are morally good men are you with me they're still good men they still believe in rightful things they still read their Bible but the difference between you and them is the spirit of God I'll show you how big the difference is when the tribulation comes you're not counted in the tribulation because of one difference the spirit of God you said well is this message really worth living for I'll say it is because this message will get you out of a tribulation and put you in a Rapture you see the difference between us and them we have a king H you see God is Sovereign on all of his ways that God sees before you ever make a choice that 450 years before 1st Samuel chapter 8 there in Deuteronomy Deuteronomy 17 and4 he said when you call for a king when you call for a king I will set it up this way when you come into the land and you ask for a king he said it'll be one that I choose so he knew that they were going to ask for a king he but notice his sovereignty in it he said but he'll be one that's taken from your brethren that I choose you see how powerful God is even in your own choices that was leading you astray he was in your desires you know the Bible said it's one of the most powerful scriptures in Psalms chapter 37 and4 that he will give you Delight thyself in the Lord and He will give you the very desires of your heart excuse me now notice the church world didn't want the Holy Ghost you hear Brother brand I'm sitting there brother bham is is not just one of the guys brother bham is standing with the elite of the age he stands with presidents he stands with Governors he stands with congressmen he goes and he actually sets with Kings and praise for kings and he is sitting there with the leaders of denominations and he's standing there and they are rejecting the Holy Ghost there are certain denominations that will reject you because you you say holy ghost instead of Holy Spirit and brother Brandon was talking to a Catholic woman one time and he said to her he said unless you go up there and get drunk on the Holy Ghost like the Mary like the mother of Jesus like she went up there say he and that woman said you mean to tell me that I got to go up there and Frolic and get the Holy Ghost like they got it he said 'absolutely you do she said 'w I don't want to go to heaven then he said 'w I highly doubt you'll ever be there' I don't care if the Pope's in heaven I want to go to [Applause] heaven some of you a little bit worried about that statement I don't care who's here I want to be there I don't care if Elvis press's here or marelon Monroe's there I want to go I don't care and I don't want to see my worst enemy go the other direction but the world doesn't want this Holy Ghost the world doesn't want what you got because they they they they want a refined worship they want somebody that looks apart that says amen just right doesn't sweat all over the place doesn't hoop and holler and gets out his message in 15 minutes that's true I was dealing with a man one time that was fixing my Fork Clift he was surfice in my for Clifton he's standing there I forget which denomination he was he's he's standing there telling me real good guy real good guy and he standing there and he was telling me about he said you know he said we're looking about getting a different Pastor he said he's a good guy and he said but likes to get to drinking likes to get drinking he said he said I'm okay with him drinking he said but he can't show up to our church our church things our our programs drunk I think it's time you change churches no you don't need to change pastors you need to change churches you see they want that kind of it well the pastor didn't just suit me just right so we'll we'll just vote in another one you know brother Brandon was standing there and he would sit there and he said now he said what you had it's a genuine Holy Ghost he said but you wouldn't leave good enough alone he said and you went in there and you organized it he said that was a true holy spirit that fell back there 40 years ago he said but you wouldn't leave it alone and you begin to organize it and said this is the way it's got to be but the prophet said that God's church is free God's church is bound by No Boundaries from sea to Sea it's gods and every human being under the Earth belongs to God so God sets the boundaries not maning their wisdom of how much you got to read your Bible and how much you got to pray and how many tapes you got to listen to and how much wisdom you got to have I'll say it like this how bad do you want the Holy Ghost like Mary got it like Peter got it like Paul got it come on some you don't need seven steps to get the Holy Ghost Jesus said except you be born again you cannot even understand the kingdom of God let me go a little bit further you don't have to lean to No Man's understanding you don't have to lean to No Man's ideas of what it takes to get the Holy Ghost I'll tell you what it takes the Holy Ghost it says acts two prescription of repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remissions of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost This Promise is unto you and to your children and to them that are as far off as many as the Lord Our God shall call you ain't got to lean to some Bishop's idea you ain't got to lean to some Pope's idea there's a king that is the King of Kings and the Lord of lords [Applause] I love when Hosea 13:9 says oh Israel thou Hast destroyed thyself but in me is thine help I will be thy King where is any other that may save thee in all thy cities thy judges of whom thou sayest give me a king and princes I gave thee a king of mine anger and took him away in my wrath so God is showing that if you trust in human authority it'll lead you to disappointment but if you trust in God it'll bring his blessings because the Bible said in Jeremiah 17:5 thus sayith the Lord cursed be the man that trusteth in a man and maketh flesh's arms and whose heart departeth from the Lord for he shall be like a heath in the desert that's a tree without moisture and shall not see when good cometh but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness in a salt land and not inhabit it blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord and whose hope the Lord is for he shall be as a tree planted By the Waters that spreadeth out her Roots by the river and shall not see when he cometh but her leavf shall be green and shall not be careful in the year of drought neither shall cease from yielding fruit that's a man that trusts in the Lord this world is so demanding of you and I where are you going to spend your energies out where are you going to spend your extra time at why don't you come over here why don't you come over there it's constantly somebody wanting you to go to this party or that party or come over here and and do this and do that but who are you going to let rule your life maybe I'll just talk to you who who you going to let rule your life who you going to let be who you going to let be your king when Israel was in this spot I'd say they never intended they never intended on getting a saw that would allow some amonite King to live they never expected to get a Ahab that would turning him back and bringing a jezebel wife I'd say they never intended to get a jobor that would bring in false worship and deny the almighty God I say you they never intended they never intended to get a Herod in there that would kill the King of Kings they didn't know what they were asking for when they said give us a king give us a king but in the age of mu and I are living in the prophet would preach and in the God of this evil age he would stand there he would stand there and say he said no he said God he said either God has lost control or there's or there's something going on there's there two opposing spirits that are at work there's two opposing Spirits he said one of them is God's spirit and the other one is a devil's Spirit he said but God is bringing a bride and the reason how he's bringing a bride is because he's bringing a Vindicated message and he's bringing in this bride so you realize oh man I wish I had the voice of 10,000 angels the reason why you are under this kingship it's because a Vindicated message came by your way you see the evil spirit is out there and he's preaching unbelief and and idolatry and the unpure word but God's spirit is gathering in a people and he's setting up Kings and Priests in this generation Hall the Bible said in Proverbs 25 and 28 he that hath no rule of his own spirit is like a city that's broken down and without walls so imagine your heart as a fortress with strong walls and a locked gate that God's word is the foundation of that Fortress and that Fortress provides you with security it protects you from spiritual enemies it guards off every every attack of the enemy but every time you begin to doubt God's word and you begin to let unbelief and sin get in there it's like you are unlocking the gate to this Fortress and every time you begin to let unbelief come in and saying well those things are for days going by you're leaving the gate open and every single time you allow disbelief to come in and so well it it maybe it's for this brother for that brother you're leaving the gate open you look at the example of Eve there and all of a sudden the serpent starts talking to her and he starts telling her said now surely surely God didn't mean what he meant and immediately when she said when she said what he told me these things and she begin to open up the gate and all of a sudden unbelief got in and it created the greatest crevice in the Fortress then and you look at Judas you look at Judas he was walking with Elohim in flesh he was as close as anybody was close to him but as soon as he allowed temptation to start coming in and the enemy to start whispering lies that surely I love what the prophet said and lean not to an I own understanding he Judas he said Judas really believe that Jesus had got himself out of this mess he was leaning on his own understanding and as soon as he was tempted to turn him in and deny him for 30 pieces of silver the crevice begin to crack the stronghold begin to the thing got ajar and all of a sudden the enemy kept coming in there you think you can handle these things you think you can handle the little bitty Temptations but I'll tell you what it'll do Judas thought he could handle it but I'll tell you where to leave you it leave you hanging on a tree because Judas was not willing to go where Peter was willing to go Peter didn't look like the man Mary didn't look like the woman but they were willing to go to Pentecost and Judas wasn't willing to go there Judas his Spirit went back to Sean but Jesus when he was hanging on the cross he Spirit Hallelujah went 50 days later and was released on the day of Pentecost you see the power of the spirit that was on the man because one went to hell but one Hallelujah ascended to the heights Hallelujah and they opened up the gates and said who is the king of glory he is the god that is mighty in battle and in your life when you start listening to your country music I'm talking to you cuz I can't preach if I could preach I'd preach but as soon as you let that music of country music well it's not a problem for me come on as soon as you start listening to your rap music well it's not a problem for me as soon as you start putting in that Copenhagen one more time well it's not a problem for me as soon as you start looking on things you shouldn't be looking for I'll tell you what you're doing you're creating a a huge crack I love what Peter Peter says in 1 Peter 5 and8 be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil's going around like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour so he's literally creeping around looking for the ones that that are just hanging on to them addictions and hanging on to them things of the world and hanging on to this and I'll tell you what you're doing let me just let me just let me just say it like this you are hanging a sign on your door Thieves are welcome here you let the door open you let the door open all of a sudden jealousy got in there unbelief got in there fear got in there complexes got in there you see your heart is demanding of a king but who are you going to allow to be king because when brilliam brandham comes there and future home in 1964 he takes a whiteboard or Blackboard and he draws out two hearts he draws out two hearts and he puts a snake in one and a Dove and another one and he says this one is the Pharisee he said but this one is the woman at the well he said but the difference was was she had representation by [Music] predestination you see it matters who you let be king of your life you let Satan become the king of your ideas and I guarantee you you will live a miserable week you let him crown you with a crabby Spirit you watch what kind of weak you'll have but if you let King of Kings and the Lord of lords set his crown of Love on your heart everybody around you said what have you done with your life brother random lays in there it lays in there on the historical of the progression of salvation of justification sanctification and the Holy Ghost of a Luther and Wesley and the Pentecostal movement he said come all the way up to the Holy Spirit to the baptism of the Holy Holy Spirit and I love what brother random does when he lays those things in there he comes on the backside of it he said but here we are in the end time he said here we are back to the person himself it's no longer it's no longer guessing if he's there if he's the king of your heart he is the king of your heart he's the king of your emotions he's the king of your life I'll tell you the Gospel of Jesus Christ it'll work on the most rankest Sinners it'll work on the lowest of lows the gospel if it be preached it'll produce power it'll be it'll produce demonstrations it'll produce Miracles if it's preached in its fullness it'll make blls lie down it'll make Hornets go back to its nest it'll make a tree wither up and die so I know that if it's preached in it's power that it can save the lost it can redeem the broken it can restore those that need restoring it can bring you back to fellowship I love what brother bam does I'm I'm just trying to drop some some points here brother bham goes in 1956 in Perfection and brother Bram lay some very powerful things in that sermon he goes in there and he said Jesus goes to the lowest of hell and he gets down there and I love what brother Bron does he said he goes down there and he does undoes he said he undo the kink in the Rope he undos the kink in the rope and he bridged the gap for man get to get safely crossed back to him he said and running down running down he said he said what he did he went in there and he unkinked the chain he said now over top of that chain runs the blood of Jesus Christ and it restores man back to the rightful [Music] position there was a man one day that was sitting in a that was sitting in a prison cell and he was worthy of death he's worthy of death he had stole he had cheated he was a murderer he was no good and he knew that he was be about to be put to life put to death he could hear a crowd on the outside screaming all kinds of things today's Passover they they demand The Prisoner on this day I'll be surely put to death today and all of a sudden here comes a guard the prison guard walking down through the cell and he comes in and he hears the keys of jingling and he begins to cry and he begins to scream out they're going to put me death today and the prison guard opens up the door and said barabus go on do what you want to go on do what you want to you're free he looked at the prison guard said how am I free how am I free and brother random said oh I was that baramas I was saamis I was worthy of death he said how am I able to go free how am I able to he said let me show you something he you see up there on that Hill he said you hear that sound bumping up that road right there you see that man carrying that load that man took your cross so that you could go free and the prophet started singing Amazing Grace and he said I was a worse than Barabas I was that barabus but I needed a king I needed a king because a king is not a King Without a kingdom you see Satan is not the king of your life only if you allow him to give him to have access to your kingdom so take your heart away from him tell him your heart is the kingdom of almighty God but my life needed a king that could restore me and my heart was demanding a king Hallelujah because my king knew that men would reject you my king knew that men would talk about you my king knew knew that men would talk about this message you believe in but he saw you he said oh no you see if my kingdom was of this world then my kingdom would fight but because my kingdom is not of this world hallelujah hallelujah you see my kingdom if my kingdom was of this world then my kingdom would fight but Jesus turns to his disciples and said the kingdom of God will be within you and William brandham said that the kingdom and the powers and the Holy Angels all of their backing is in every son and daughter of almighty God so every demon has to flee cancer has to move sickness has to leave depression has to take its hold brother Matt every demon that has Afflicted your entire move of coming here has to leave because you are not under the kingship of Satan you are under the kingship of almighty [Applause] God cancer has to obey right right because the king of a jungle is a line and everything shuts up when the king Roars and in this age We Have Heard It In Amos 3 and 7 we have saw it in Revelations 10 The Lion The King The King the lion of the tribe of Judah hath prevailed every demon has to Bow every accuser has to Bow every sickness has to Bow I say this unto you in the name of Jesus Christ Le oosa has to take its hand off of God's Property and bow to the name of Jesus Christ you have that clip for us no clip that's all right I'll preach just a minute till they get that clip cuz it's worth it if you if you're okay to work for a minute how love the Lord Satan likes to set his boundaries you just wave your hand at me when you're ready Satan likes to set his boundaries and say you can only go this far he likes to set things and say you can't go past this trouble can trouble can come against you but I love what the prophet said is that God harnesses trouble he puts it like a a horse it puts puts puts it in a in a horse's mouth he he puts it like a bit in a horse's mouth and it controls that trouble so trouble can only go so far as God will allow it so the things that are hindering you have a boundary on it the things that are afflicting you have a boundary on it I want I want to say this to you I want you to expect the greatest experience of an outpouring of the Holy Ghost in your life because God has no boundaries God has no boundaries on who gets a on who get set free the only boundary limits that he has is his election but Satan can only go so far just like the SE can only go so far on the side of the ocean Banks the moon has the ability to say you'll go no further I say there's power in The Bride of Jesus Christ to look at trouble if you're bone of his bone life of his life power of his power put those Reigns in your hands and harness the trouble how much has Satan Afflicted your family how much has he taken away from you I'd say it's time to take it back in the name of Jesus Christ you are put here because a king a king is a king if he's got a kingdom and Jesus spoke predominantly about you being a king in this age right you know that he talked about you being a king right he talked about you being a king he talked about it in Revelations chapter 3 he talked about it in Revelations chapter 5 he talked about it in Revelations chapter 19 he talked about it and he talked predominantly about this age that to them that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my Throne notice the prophet said and how can I overcome he said now he said now when Jesus I feel good right now he said when he said how can I overcome he said he would notice what he said he said he didn't say on my Throne he said but in my Throne he said when he said a king has a domain just like just like in John chapter 14 and2 in my father's house is many mansions he said if you study that back all the way into the Greek and the Hebrew he said a man a father was over a domain and he had a Thousand Acre Farm he said but it wasn't called a farm it was called his domain and Adam when he was was there in the Garden of Eden he was under his domain to control the powers he controlled the winds he controlled the waves he named the tiger he named The Lion it was under his domain at one point brother bam said this would choke you to death he said but when man fall they lost their Dominion he said but in this hour but in this hour there will be sons and daughters that raise up that will literally take the very power away from Satan and tell him what to do that's why the prophet is standing there and he's writing down the letter when the spirit of God tells him pick up your pen and write he said notice the bride and the groom are in Perfect Harmony that she only does his will she only she only operates by the mind of Jesus Christ that's why you have the mind of Christ you have the ability to operate healing right I'm going go farther you and I have the ability to Pardon sins by the preaching of the Gospel now the Catholic the Catholics they they they they they what's the word Catholics they they turn that say it again they turned it they they perverted it they perverted it and said that they had the ability they had the ability to remit sins but we realize that there's only remission of sins in baptism they perverted it but when you come under the kingship of a born again son and daughter of God the reason why you understand the mind of Christ is because you've receiv received the mind of Christ and the reason why you understand like a king is because there's a king that is AE over your life so every demon every Power every sickness is under your domain that's why when brother William stood here and he talked about a bruised Hill you realize that he was talking about you because Satan is under your feet everything everything is under how many's got a need in their body you're a king and a priest but you didn't make yourself that way he made you that way now some of you have got I just be real open right here you've got needs in your body you've got financial needs you've got physical needs you've got spiritual needs but he put you here not to be ruled by Satan but he put you here to rule Satan I want to go just I want to bring this all the way around ever since the Garden of Eden God has been demanding a king he's looking for a housewife to be a king of her home to rule her home as a Fifth Gospel and when Satan comes in there and he afflicts your little children and gives them fever give them fever and give them gives them flu bugs you have the ability as a housewife to make Satan obey you I believe it's that powerful I believe that it was somebody that turned loose the supernatural when Mariah breit was dealing with alapa and somebody took trouble and they harnessed it and said we will receive a restored Glory I believe it was somebody that was sitting in the office of a king when Edmund way died right there in the prophet's Ministry and the prophet said Edmund wake up I believe it was somebody under kingship when there was a woman that was sitting at the back of the building that had died in the prophet's message and he told Billy Paul go back there and pray for he said oh no daddy oh no Daddy I'm not going to touch that brother ran him all of a sudden and said Mary and she snapped back and said what brother brandham I believe that he was operating under the rulership of a kingdom and the kingdom of God is within you if you are a king then you have access to everything in the Kingdom then you can tax what you want you can tax what you want you can take what you want you can give what you want I'd say it's time that you turn the tax back on the devil he robbed you with cigarettes he robbed you with alcohol now it's time to tax him I get some benefits it's time to give it's time to give Satan what he's deserving I believe Hatty R was operating under some kingship I believe she recognized that was her domain she could have had a million dollars she could have had whatever she wanted to but she asked for the most precious thing she asked for something that would not pass away brother mam said he said in this domain that you're under he said it reaches from eternity to Eternity brother Doug is powerful that when you feel like you had failures he didn't see failures when you feel like you carried some things from your own father he didn't see them things because your domain and this domain that you're under is from eternity to Eternity he didn't see your faults brother Christian didn't see your failures he didn't see your doubts he saw your faith he saw what he deposited on the inside of you are we ready I want I want it so loud they can feel it the Bible says my king is a king of the Jews he's a king of Israel he's a king of righteousness he's the king of the ages he's the king of Heaven he's a king of glory he's the king of kings and he's the Lord of lords that's my king I I wonder do you know him my King is a sovereign King no means of measure can Define his Limitless love he's enduringly strong he's entirely sincere he's eternally steadfast he's

he's the centerpiece of civilization he's unparallel he's unprecedented he is the lest idea in literature he's the highest personality in philosophy he's the fundamental doctrine of true theology he's

strengthens and sustains he guards and he guides he heals the sick he cleanse the lepers he forgives Sinners he discharges debtors he delivers the captive he defends the feeble He blesses the young he

his love never changes his word is enough his grace is efficient his reain is righteous and the Yol is easy and his f is light I wish I could describe him for yet he's Indescribable he's incomprehensible he's Invincible he's irresistible well you can't get him out of your mind you can't you can't get him off of your hand you can't outm him and you can't live without him well the Pharisees couldn't stand him but they found out they couldn't stop him P couldn't find any fault in him Terror couldn't kill him death couldn't handle him and the grave couldn't hold him that's my that's my somebody give praise to the King of Kings hallah he's only your lord if you make him your Lord he's only your king if you make him your king he's king that's my king I wonder do you know him

gangs he's King over wrestlers he's King when you're in Alaska he's King when you're born in a right kind of a family he's King when you're born in the wrong kind of a family I tell you he's King he's king of righteousness he's king of all Kings he's King whether you serve him and he's King whether you won't serve him I'll tell you he'll be king in the Rapture he'll be king in the tribulation and we will go with him I got I got to read it to you go re go with me to Revelations 19 do you know my [Music] king Hallelujah Revelations 1911 and I saw heaven open and behold a white horse and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true and righteous and he doth judge and make war his eyes were as a flame of fire and on his head were many crowns and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself and he was clothed with a vesture dipped in Blood and his name is called the word of God and the armies which were in heaven followed him that's [Music] you that's my king and the armies which were in heaven followed him upon the white horses clothed with fine linen and white clean you ain't spotted you never was spotted you were just spotted here but in his mind white and clean white and clean now I want you to say that over your life sister April you were white and clean I want you to say it so loud till you believe it I'm white and I'm clean Hallelujah and out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword and with it he should Smite the Nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron and he treadeth The Wine Press of the fearness with the fierceness and the Wrath of the almighty God and he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written king of kings and Lord of lords so when he's King you are with him and when he's Lord of lords you are with him but you're not with him in your guilt you're not with him with your spots you are with him in your Guiltless in your spotless white and clean garments that's my king I'm identified with a king that made me a king brother Jim when the enemy comes in like a flood because you are a king the spirit of God on the inside of you raises up the standard and the enemy's got to stand still because you're a [Music] king I know you're my wife but I want to say this to you because a pillar fire is real near you have the ability to roll back the reproach that has been said and done against you because you are a part of a kingship that never will in King Herod his kingship came to an end King Ahab his kingship came to an end but our kingship will be from eternity to eternity your healing may come and your healing may go but the god
