[0:00] [Music]
[0:03] [Applause]
[0:07] so
[0:13] [Music]
[0:20] [Applause]
[0:25] [Music]
[0:46] see how we can rest upon his word then
[0:49] no matter how hard the storm flows
[0:52] what's contrary to it rest solemnly upon
[0:56] the world amen god said it who've seen
[0:58] the other side of the storm
[1:01] so if you're sick just anchor your soul
[1:05] in the haven of rest
[1:06] [Music]
[1:08] if you're perplexed and distressed
[1:10] remember he said i'll be with you always
[1:14] even to the end of the world
[1:18] and he's pr
[1:19] he said all things work together for
[1:22] good to them that love the lord so just
[1:24] stay right there
[1:27] one man wrote a poet wrote my anchor
[1:30] holds within the veil
[1:32] what is the veil is something that shuts
[1:34] off
[1:35] here from there
[1:37] and the anchor is on the inside of the
[1:41] veil
[1:42] you don't see how it's going to be
[1:45] but you know that there's something
[1:47] that's got a hold of you
[1:49] that's got to hold up there
[1:53] and when the sea is blowing and starving
[1:55] did you ever i guess maybe somebody has
[1:58] never been privileged to see a ship
[1:59] anchored
[2:00] oh my
[2:02] i wrote him on it throughout a sea
[2:04] anchor like that until the little craft
[2:06] couldn't even go over the top of the
[2:08] wave it would go through the way
[2:10] but as long as the anchor helps
[2:14] that's all makes any difference whether
[2:15] we go over under around or through it
[2:18] doesn't matter
[2:19] the anchor holes
[2:22] that's the way when storms of life begin
[2:25] to shake us
[2:26] we may have to go through and they have
[2:28] to go over under around
[2:31] but just let the anchor hole within the
[2:33] veil to the unseen
[2:34] we don't know just exactly where it's at
[2:37] but it's a holding
[2:39] just like the little boy you know that
[2:41] had the kite you've heard the old
[2:43] proverb of the story
[2:45] said how you know you got a coyote in
[2:47] there so i can still feel it tugging
[2:50] so that's it
[2:52] if we can feel it still tugging god
[2:54] dealing with our hearts
[2:56] then we know our anchor still holds
[2:59] i believe it was benjamin franklin who
[3:01] caught the lightning in the bottle who
[3:03] harnessed lightning electricity
[3:06] something within him called and said
[3:08] there's
[3:09] power in that
[3:11] that power could be harnessed
[3:14] and if it's that powerful to shoot the
[3:16] streaks in the burst of timbers split
[3:19] over the ground what could it do if it
[3:21] was once
[3:22] harnessed it'll lighten flesh and hit
[3:25] the whole earth
[3:26] and benjamin franklin i believe fishing
[3:29] on his kite with a key tied on the end
[3:31] of the tail of a bottle down the bottom
[3:34] and when he got it
[3:36] he didn't know what he had
[3:38] but he began to scream i got it i got it
[3:42] he didn't know what it was he didn't
[3:43] know what he was going to do with it but
[3:46] he know he had something
[3:48] and that's the way with every man that's
[3:51] hopes are built on nothing less
[3:54] than jesus blood with righteousness
[3:57] all around my soul gives way that he's
[4:01] all my hope and state on christ's solid
[4:05] rock i stand all other grounds this
[4:07] sinking sins
[4:09] once born again the holy spirit takes
[4:11] its place into the heart
[4:13] some young people may not are young or
[4:15] maybe illiterate no matter how it is
[4:18] there's no one can explain it so don't
[4:20] feel bad because you're illiterate
[4:22] you couldn't explain it there's never
[4:24] been a man yet could explain it no
[4:25] matter how smart or how intelligent it's
[4:27] god's own secret amen but when that word
[4:31] takes life in your heart you see it
[4:33] you scream i got it
[4:35] amen
[4:36] you don't know what you're going to do
[4:38] with it you don't know what it's going
[4:39] to do with you
[4:41] but you know something's happened amen
[4:44] and you got it

[46:18] the final voice
[46:20] the final voice to the final wage
[46:23] amen exodus chapter 19 and verse 3
[46:26] and moses went up unto god and the lord
[46:29] called unto him out of the mountain
[46:31] saying
[46:32] thus
[46:33] shalt thou say to the house of jacob and
[46:36] tell the children of israel
[46:38] you have seen what i did unto the
[46:40] egyptians and how i bear you on eagle's
[46:42] wings and brought you unto myself
[46:45] now therefore if ye will obey my voice
[46:48] indeed and keep my covenant then ye
[46:51] shall be a peculiar treasure unto me
[46:53] above all people
[46:55] for all the earth is mine and ye shall
[46:58] be unto me a kingdom of priests
[47:01] and a holy nation
[47:03] these are the words
[47:04] which thou shalt speak unto the children
[47:07] of israel and moses came and called for
[47:10] the elders of the people
[47:12] and laid before their faces all these
[47:15] words which the lord commanded him
[47:19] also revelations chapter 10 and verse 7.

[47:32] brother johnny am i doing okay for you

[47:39] up your hand tell me slow down i'll i'll
[47:41] do my best
[47:43] my best
[47:45] revelations chapter 10 and verse 7 but
[47:47] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[47:50] angel
[47:51] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[47:53] of god should be finished
[47:56] as he hath declared to his servants the
[47:58] prophets
[47:59] and the voice which i heard from heaven
[48:02] spank unto me again and said go and take
[48:05] the little book which is open let's say
[48:07] that together which is open
[48:10] in the hand of the angel which standeth
[48:12] upon the sea and upon the earth
[48:15] and i went unto the angel
[48:18] and said unto him give me the little
[48:20] book now we know that john represents
[48:23] the bride here
[48:24] verse 9 and i went as as john
[48:27] representing the bride and i went unto
[48:29] the angel and said unto him give me the
[48:31] little book and he said unto me take it
[48:35] and eat it up and it shall make thy
[48:37] belly bitter but it shall be in thy
[48:39] mouth as sweet as honey that's what the
[48:42] word does it goes on the inside you go
[48:45] to digesting that word eating that word
[48:48] and it causes a war on the inside of you
[48:51] but when you speak that word
[48:53] when it comes across your lips it's
[48:55] sweet as honey and i took the little
[48:58] book out of the angel's hand notice what
[49:00] you do
[49:01] i took the little book out of the
[49:03] angel's hands and ate it up
[49:06] and it was in my mouth the sweetest
[49:09] honey and as soon as i had eaten it my
[49:11] belly was bitter and he said unto me
[49:14] thou must prophesy again
[49:16] before many peoples and nations and
[49:19] tongues and kings may god bless his word
[49:23] you may be seated in the presence of the
[49:25] lord let's have church today
[49:28] i shared the quote with the brothers as
[49:31] we just go into this this morning so put
[49:33] that on the screen for you
[49:35] now as it is declared in malachi 4 and 6
[49:39] that will turn the hearts of the
[49:41] children back
[49:43] to back to the fathers he will bring
[49:46] back the elect of the last day and they
[49:49] will hear a vindicated prophet and give
[49:51] the exact truth as it was with paul he
[49:55] will restore the truth as they had it
[49:57] and those elect with him in that day
[50:00] will be the ones who truly manifest the
[50:03] lord and be his body and be his voice
[50:07] and perform his works hallelujah do you
[50:10] see it
[50:11] i believe that as brother branham is
[50:13] saying those things i believe that he is
[50:15] speaking to you and i believe that he's
[50:16] looking at you
[50:18] that he's seeing a people that will
[50:20] truly manifest the lord jesus that will
[50:22] truly be his body truly perform his
[50:25] works and truly be his voice
[50:28] a momentary consideration of the church
[50:30] history will prove how accurate this is
[50:34] this thought is in the dark ages the
[50:36] word was almost entirely lost to the
[50:38] people but god sent luther with with the
[50:41] word the lutheran spoke for god at that
[50:44] time but they organized and and again
[50:46] the pure word for the loss was lost for
[50:50] organization tends towards dogma and
[50:53] creeds and not simple words they could
[50:55] no longer speak for god
[50:57] then god sent wesley and he was the
[50:59] voice with the word in his day
[51:01] the people who took his revelation from
[51:04] god became the 11 epistles read and
[51:06] known of all men for their generation
[51:09] when the methodist failed god raised up
[51:11] others so it has gone on through the
[51:13] years until in this last day there is
[51:16] again another people in the land
[51:19] who under their messenger will be the
[51:21] final voice to the final age that's our
[51:24] fault this morning who under their
[51:26] messenger you cannot separate us from
[51:28] this message
[51:29] and you cannot separate us from the
[51:31] messenger
[51:33] are you with me i am i am proud to stand
[51:35] with william branham i'm proud to stand
[51:37] with the seventh messenger and i'm proud
[51:40] to be a part of this final voice to this
[51:42] final age we're not looking for
[51:44] something more we're here
[51:46] we're right here it's not a day coming
[51:49] it's not a day in the future but we're
[51:51] here
[51:52] you see yes sir the church is no longer
[51:54] the mouthpiece of god it is it is uh it
[51:57] is his own mouthpiece so god is turning
[52:00] on her notice he will confound her
[52:02] through the prophet and the bride for
[52:05] the voice of god will be in her yes it
[52:08] is for it says in the last chapter of
[52:10] revelations verse and 17
[52:13] that the spirit and the bride say come
[52:17] notice our hearts have been turned
[52:20] back to the faith of the pentecostal
[52:22] fathers that which paul preached we
[52:25] preach that what's peter preached we
[52:27] preached are you with me that which john
[52:30] preached that which john believed are
[52:32] you with me that which polycarp preached
[52:34] we believe that which william branham
[52:36] preached we believe we're not looking
[52:38] for a day off in the future for another
[52:41] people to come and take this book and
[52:43] run with it we are in the hour of a
[52:45] final voice and if you could recognize
[52:48] this morning that your voice is his
[52:50] voice
[52:52] his word is his voice and when you take
[52:55] this word you are no longer speaking
[52:58] your word you are speaking the literal
[53:01] life of jesus christ on written pages
[53:04] but it's no longer in a book it's in a
[53:06] people
[53:07] to express the godhead deity that god we
[53:11] know had a threefold purpose first that
[53:14] he would express god in christ secondly
[53:16] to have the preeminence in the church's
[53:18] people and then thirdly to restore the
[53:21] kingdom back to his rightful position
[53:23] we're not looking for another day but
[53:26] now is the day now are we the sons of
[53:29] god
[53:32] hallelujah we and the bride the bride
[53:35] and the spirit say the same exact thing
[53:39] hallelujah
[53:41] hallelujah
[53:43] we're living in a very powerful day
[53:46] living in a very permanent hour in a
[53:48] very very pressing time but a very
[53:50] powerful time you look at everything
[53:53] that's going on in the world you can see
[53:54] its pressing you can see darkness as
[53:57] it's trying to push out light but light
[53:59] just keeps pushing back
[54:01] and that light will never be put out
[54:02] because this light is that is shining is
[54:05] not you and i
[54:06] it is the light of the word that is
[54:08] shined upon this word and we see exactly
[54:11] where we are
[54:13] we're not looking off into some future
[54:16] we're not looking out into the eighth
[54:18] day that that we're looking for another
[54:20] people to come another messenger to come
[54:22] we have received a message that will
[54:25] produce a body change that has produced
[54:28] a bride for the body change
[54:31] [Applause]
[54:33] and she's standing on her feet
[54:35] and here we are living in this hour when
[54:37] hell has enlarged her gates and you
[54:40] watch as she keeps swallowing soul after
[54:42] soul after soul and it keeps taking men
[54:46] into that pit and it keeps swallowing
[54:48] men and it keeps and it looks like hell
[54:51] is on a rampage he's trying to take our
[54:53] young people trying to take our health
[54:56] trying to take our wealth trying to take
[54:58] our right mind but there is a people
[55:00] that's got her feet on the earth today
[55:04] that knows where she is that knows what
[55:06] he wants done with the word and she has
[55:09] thus saith the lord or she set steel
[55:12] this is a people that is not fighting
[55:14] the devil with a closed book she is
[55:17] fighting the devil with an open book
[55:19] that knows what he wants done with the
[55:22] word if he wants healing the bride will
[55:24] preach healing if he wants you to have
[55:27] deliverance the bride will preach
[55:29] deliverance
[55:30] hallelujah you are not speaking of
[55:33] something of days gone by the seven
[55:36] thunders have uttered their voices and
[55:38] the revelations of the seventh seal has
[55:41] been revealed before you
[55:44] hallelujah it's not six seals open it's
[55:47] seven seals open and you are fighting
[55:51] with an open book
[55:54] you ate this book you became this book
[55:58] it makes you the final voice to the
[56:00] final age
[56:03] glory be to god
[56:05] and the voice of god is in her
[56:10] he wants to use your voice this morning
[56:13] he wants to use her hands this morning
[56:15] he wants to use your feet this morning i
[56:18] know it's a paradox
[56:19] but god is wanting to he's so wanting to
[56:22] use your body
[56:24] and borrow your body
[56:26] as the prophet would say if he would
[56:28] give me a temporary resurrection that he
[56:31] would come and use my body i'd say oh
[56:35] jesus come this morning give us a
[56:37] temporary resurrection and use my body
[56:41] use my mouth use my hands use my feet
[56:45] use my mind i know it's a paradox
[56:49] just like it's a paradox to look out
[56:51] upon the moon and watch set that moon as
[56:53] the watchdog to watch over that sea to
[56:56] make sure that that sea doesn't go past
[56:58] it you see that moon is the one that
[57:01] controls those waves they can't get no
[57:03] higher than what the moon says
[57:06] those waves can't go in no further than
[57:09] what the moon says
[57:10] and you are a representative of jesus
[57:13] christ him being the son you be in the
[57:15] moon you were not put here so that the
[57:18] devil could control you you were put
[57:20] here
[57:21] you were put here to control the devil
[57:24] and tell him that you are not my father
[57:29] what you try to throw on me i give it
[57:31] back to you
[57:33] i know it's a paradox but you are
[57:36] sitting as god in
[57:39] slap flesh
[57:39] neighbor give them a high five i say i'm
[57:42] looking at god in flesh
[57:46] hallelujah
[57:48] hallelujah i've seen the voice speak the
[57:51] cripples and straighten them up
[57:52] i've seen the voice of god speak to the
[57:54] blind and his eyes come open
[57:57] to the dying cancer written to the leper
[57:59] and see them return back in flesh in the
[58:02] perfect health again
[58:03] i've seen him speak to the alcoholics
[58:05] and neurotics
[58:07] and all the off-cast
[58:09] and the skid robots
[58:11] and they become ladies and gentlemens
[58:13] and saints of the living god because the
[58:15] voice of god spoke
[58:17] that's what we listen for
[58:20] no matter your condition heaven speaking
[58:23] this morning
[58:24] no matter where you're at heaven's
[58:26] speaking this morning
[58:29] you see if you can make his word you're
[58:31] absolute
[58:33] you can
[58:37] you can make his word your absolute and
[58:40] any divine promise in the bible if you
[58:42] can tie your soul to it and you can
[58:45] no matter how much the waves whip you
[58:47] around you're still tied to that
[58:49] absolute
[58:51] no matter what comes you're still tied
[58:52] to it cancer may come but you're still
[58:55] tied to the absolute sickness may come
[58:57] but you're still tied to the absolute
[58:59] loved ones may pass away but you're
[59:01] still tied to the absolute you're not
[59:04] tied onto something that's wishy-washy
[59:06] you're tied unto the god of heaven
[59:09] he ain't changed his mind for 2000 years
[59:12] and he ain't planning on changing it now
[59:15] you are tied onto the almighty god
[59:19] i believe everything within me this
[59:21] weekend that god is speaking and god is
[59:24] calling
[59:25] i don't believe that the apostolic age
[59:27] is over but i believe it's still in
[59:29] session
[59:30] i believe it's still on i believe god's
[59:32] still calling i believe his holy
[59:34] spirit's still falling
[59:36] and i want to say to you that he'll come
[59:38] to you
[59:39] he'll come to you and no matter what
[59:40] condition you're in whether you're an
[59:43] alcoholic whether you're a prostitute
[59:45] whether you're a farmer whether you're a
[59:47] drug addict whether you're out in sin no
[59:50] matter your condition he'll come to you
[59:52] you just count on this god and he'll
[59:54] come calling to you

[1:00:03] arise shake yourself come back to the
[1:00:06] father's kingdom

[1:00:10] come out of her my people
[1:00:12] come out of her
[1:00:14] woo hallelujah
[1:00:17] when rahab heard that message when she
[1:00:19] heard about the god
[1:00:21] of the universe that he was moving
[1:00:23] she knew that she could not stay in that
[1:00:25] condition no more but she wanted to be
[1:00:28] identified with that message
[1:00:30] that this was a message that was going
[1:00:32] to take her out of that condition
[1:00:34] is there anybody else that's identified
[1:00:36] with a message that took them out of
[1:00:38] their condition

[1:00:50] videos on why i left the message i'd
[1:00:52] like to make a youtube video on why i'm
[1:00:55] in the message

[1:01:00] my life i'm in this message because it's
[1:01:03] none other than jesus christ i was a
[1:01:05] drug addict i was an alcoholic but this
[1:01:09] message came by my way

[1:05:12] you see jesus would even say he would
[1:05:15] pray in john chapter 17 and nine he said
[1:05:18] i pray for them i pray not for the world
[1:05:21] but for them
[1:05:22] which thou has given me for they are
[1:05:24] thine
[1:05:25] and all are mine are fine and thine of
[1:05:28] mine and i am glorified in them
[1:05:30] i and and now i am no more in the world
[1:05:33] but these are in the world and i come to
[1:05:36] be holy father
[1:05:37] keep through thy own name those whom now
[1:05:40] has given me
[1:05:44] that they may be one as we are one
[1:05:49] you see it's a people becoming one
[1:05:52] with god
[1:05:54] i caught this this week and who do you
[1:05:56] say this is in 1964 he said be warned as
[1:05:59] i am the father of one yay be that kind
[1:06:03] of one then how will that be the word in
[1:06:06] us would be the anointed word
[1:06:09] that is the oneness of god
[1:06:12] see the oneness of god is the word
[1:06:14] anointed in you
[1:06:18] close your bible walk out the door you
[1:06:21] just had church
[1:06:23] hallelujah the oneness of god is the
[1:06:26] word anointed in you
[1:06:30] not a dead word but an alive word and
[1:06:33] then you become a son a messiah of the
[1:06:37] age
[1:06:38] this is the day of adoption when you are
[1:06:42] so filled up with his life that it's no
[1:06:45] longer you and you sit there in your
[1:06:47] rightful position as a son as a daughter
[1:06:50] of god you have an inheritance this
[1:06:52] morning
[1:06:55] can i just say something to you i would
[1:06:57] say that if the tutor goes back to the
[1:06:59] father this morning he would go back and
[1:07:01] say well done
[1:07:04] i've watched your sons i've watched your
[1:07:06] daughters they do everything in your
[1:07:09] name they act in your name they praise
[1:07:12] in your name they worship in your name
[1:07:16] hallelujah and when that son goes out
[1:07:19] over that field he can act in the
[1:07:21] father's name though it may seem like
[1:07:24] it's so outreach and so out far out
[1:07:26] there he is acting in the father's name
[1:07:31] it may seem strange to the rest of the
[1:07:33] world the way you act
[1:07:37] you're not acting in your name
[1:07:39] you're acting in the father's name
[1:07:42] when he said lay hands on a sick and
[1:07:44] they shall recover you're not acting in
[1:07:47] your name you're acting in his name
[1:07:50] he said if you drink any deadly thing it
[1:07:52] shall not harm you you're not acting in
[1:07:54] your name you're acting his name
[1:07:58] i believe that if anything if you're
[1:08:00] behind something you'll put your name on
[1:08:02] it and jesus was so for his word in you
[1:08:08] that he would put his stamp of approval
[1:08:10] behind it and say you can do this in my
[1:08:13] name
[1:08:18] when you lay your hands on somebody it
[1:08:20] ain't you
[1:08:22] it's who you represent
[1:08:25] it's who you're acting as it's who
[1:08:27] you're representing as the god of heaven
[1:08:31] you're an ambassador
[1:08:33] of the kingdom of the most high god
[1:08:36] and when you lay your hands upon a
[1:08:38] brother
[1:08:39] and they might be sick
[1:08:41] sick unto death
[1:08:44] it doesn't say that they will
[1:08:45] immediately get well but they shall
[1:08:47] recover
[1:08:50] that's what it says
[1:08:52] he said these sites will follow them
[1:08:55] that believe
[1:08:57] you're not acting in your name you're
[1:08:58] acting his name and when you lay your
[1:09:00] hands upon them and they don't see a
[1:09:02] miracle and they give up on god don't
[1:09:04] you give up on his promise
[1:09:07] don't you make that feel like you didn't
[1:09:09] touch them right or you didn't lay your
[1:09:10] hands on them right they shall recover
[1:09:13] and if god said it that settles it
[1:09:17] [Applause]
[1:09:20] so many people get so upset
[1:09:22] i prayed i prayed i prayed i prayed i
[1:09:24] prayed

[1:14:48] tired of this
[1:14:49] you have the right to walk out
[1:14:53] but if you enjoy this you have the right
[1:14:55] to stay
[1:14:57] amen
[1:15:04] notice in hebrews 11
[1:15:06] now faith is the substance of things
[1:15:09] hoped for the evidence of things not
[1:15:11] seen
[1:15:12] for by it the elders obtained a good
[1:15:15] report
[1:15:16] through faith we understand
[1:15:20] that the worlds were framed
[1:15:22] by the word of god
[1:15:24] so that the things which are seen were
[1:15:26] not made
[1:15:28] of things which do not appear
[1:15:33] you see now notice
[1:15:34] oh my when god speaks all heaven records
[1:15:37] it i tell you it's got to happen no
[1:15:39] matter how funny it seems and how
[1:15:41] unreasonable it seems it's going to
[1:15:43] happen anyhow because god said it was
[1:15:46] and my words will be fulfilled in their
[1:15:48] season now notice in god's preparation
[1:15:51] he said now you better believe god
[1:15:52] that's right when god speaks anything
[1:15:55] it's going to happen anyhow no matter if
[1:15:57] all
[1:15:58] the whole rest of the church world downs
[1:16:00] it god's going to bring it to pass
[1:16:04] anyhow faith looks past
[1:16:07] what you can see
[1:16:10] the very world that we stand on was
[1:16:13] created created out of things which do
[1:16:16] not appear
[1:16:19] when jesus was walking with the ruler of
[1:16:22] israel by the name of jairus when he was
[1:16:25] walking with him when they told him that
[1:16:27] his daughter was sick and somebody came
[1:16:29] running and said trouble the master no
[1:16:31] more
[1:16:32] your daughter has died
[1:16:34] jesus kept walking
[1:16:37] jesus realized the authority in his
[1:16:40] words
[1:16:41] and jesus kept walking
[1:16:44] death had done knocked on the door but
[1:16:47] jesus kept walking
[1:16:50] there's a lot of things that was
[1:16:52] knocking on your door but jesus came
[1:16:54] walking
[1:16:55] and he didn't stop because of the
[1:16:58] circumstances that was in your life
[1:17:02] you was messed up you was wrecked up you
[1:17:06] was in sin you was in chain but jesus
[1:17:09] kept on walking
[1:17:11] why did jesus keep walking because he
[1:17:14] knew the end result of your life when
[1:17:16] everybody else around you criticized you
[1:17:19] said you never lived right said you
[1:17:21] never make it don't go back there you
[1:17:24] just kept following what he
[1:17:26] [Applause]
[1:17:28] said ain't that right
[1:17:33] hallelujah
[1:17:34] jesus is not concerned about what
[1:17:36] everybody else is doing
[1:17:40] he's got his eyes on you brother mike
[1:17:42] he's got his eyes on you sister joyce
[1:17:45] he's got his eyes on you and he's
[1:17:47] walking
[1:17:49] when jesus walked in the room
[1:17:51] and everybody was mourning
[1:17:53] jesus said these words
[1:17:56] she's not dead she's only asleep and the
[1:18:00] bible said that they laughed him to
[1:18:03] scorn
[1:18:04] in other words they embarrassed him by
[1:18:07] criticizing him
[1:18:10] but did that bother jesus
[1:18:12] jesus began to speak in another realm he
[1:18:17] knew that she was only sleeping and she
[1:18:20] began to say he began to speak in
[1:18:21] another language and he said to lethe he
[1:18:23] called me daughter arise
[1:18:26] and though that one looked like she was

[1:20:55] knocked off your high horse and see a
[1:20:57] light of the holy ghost

[1:21:03] out
[1:21:04] but paul said i have not attained but i
[1:21:08] pressed towards it
[1:21:09] if paul could stand there and say those
[1:21:11] things
[1:21:12] i ain't getting that maybe i ain't
[1:21:14] necessarily attained everything but i'm
[1:21:16] still going to keep on going maybe i
[1:21:18] don't understand everything the seven
[1:21:19] messenger said but i'm gonna keep on
[1:21:21] going i'm gonna keep on preaching i'm
[1:21:23] gonna keep on living
[1:21:25] maybe i don't know everything about how
[1:21:27] the healing's coming how the miracle's
[1:21:29] coming but i'm pressing
[1:21:32] let satan press all he wants to you
[1:21:34] press him back
[1:21:37] you're not focused on what satan's got
[1:21:40] to say you're focused on thus saith the
[1:21:43] lord
[1:21:47] you were seen there
[1:21:50] how many agrees on that thought you were
[1:21:52] seen there
[1:21:53] before the foundation of the world you
[1:21:54] were seen there
[1:21:58] a voice spoke
[1:22:00] a voice spoke to you
[1:22:02] didn't he sister stephanie and he told
[1:22:03] you to be here
[1:22:05] he told you that you'd not only be here
[1:22:07] but you'd be there
[1:22:08] ain't that right ain't that what he said
[1:22:10] he'd you'd be there
[1:22:13] if the voice of god spoke that
[1:22:19] let all the other chaos of life the
[1:22:22] voices of life the expressions of life
[1:22:24] let them do what they want to
[1:22:26] i heard a voice
[1:22:29] let all the other chickens do what they
[1:22:30] want to down on the ground i was built
[1:22:32] for flying
[1:22:36] they didn't recognize this call but i
[1:22:38] did
[1:22:40] they didn't flop their wings like i did
[1:22:43] i kept on flopping
[1:22:45] it looked like i was doing some kind of
[1:22:47] crazy topsy-turvy flip over thing when i
[1:22:50] was just getting my wings but let me
[1:22:52] give my wings just a little bit and you
[1:22:54] watch me soar
[1:22:56] don't you get shook up don't you get
[1:22:59] shook up on what this person doing or
[1:23:01] what that person doing don't you get
[1:23:03] shook up i ain't even shook up about it
[1:23:07] and if i ain't shook up about it there's
[1:23:09] no reason that you should get shook up
[1:23:11] about it
[1:23:13] just let them
[1:23:14] you just let god take over
[1:23:17] it may look like they're a little bit
[1:23:19] wobbly here and there but if they are an
[1:23:21] eagle if that predestinated seeds on the
[1:23:24] inside of them they're gonna get up
[1:23:27] they're gonna wake up they're gonna get
[1:23:28] above the barn
[1:23:30] they're gonna keep on soaring go above
[1:23:32] the mountains
[1:23:37] you gave confidence in this voice
[1:23:41] are you with me you can have confidence
[1:23:43] in this voice
[1:23:44] willie upshaw had confidence in that
[1:23:46] voice
[1:23:47] when he sat in that condition for so
[1:23:49] many years he sat there in that
[1:23:51] condition stayed in that condition
[1:23:53] but finally he heard a voice that said i
[1:23:56] see a man i see a man that is a that is
[1:23:59] an upstate man that is that is a
[1:24:00] well-known man he said i didn't know who

[1:24:05] congressman upshaw he said i didn't know
[1:24:07] who he was
[1:24:09] he said i'd sit in this condition
[1:24:11] sitting in a wheelchair deal with him
[1:24:12] crutches all of his life
[1:24:14] but that voice spoke to him

[1:24:30] where'd that voice come from
[1:24:33] it had to come from another world
[1:24:36] and he said mr upshaw thus saith the
[1:24:40] lord you're healed
[1:24:43] congressman up shaw witnessed this he
[1:24:45] said now he said brother branham knows
[1:24:49] the mind of the lord
[1:24:51] even when he didn't know the mind of the
[1:24:53] lord he put his confidence in what that
[1:24:55] messenger said
[1:24:58] he knows the mind of the lord i'll just
[1:25:00] stand up and when he took that prophet's
[1:25:03] word he rose up completely whole
[1:25:08] what was it the voice knew his future
[1:25:15] oh you oughta just been tore down the
[1:25:17] chandeliers right there

[1:25:29] though satan has sworn destruction over
[1:25:32] you this voice knows your future
[1:25:38] sure there's another voice in this world
[1:25:41] there's another voice in this world
[1:25:42] that's condemning everything that you do
[1:25:45] ain't that right young people
[1:25:48] ain't that right young people there's
[1:25:50] another voice in this world that

[1:26:00] for not dressing like a bunch of gay
[1:26:03] queers
[1:26:05] it condemns you sisters for dressing

[1:26:12] other voices of the world that will pass
[1:26:15] away but he said heaven and earth will
[1:26:17] pass away but my voice will never pass
[1:26:20] away

[1:27:26] news and cnn says that i allow it to
[1:27:30] determine my predestination
[1:27:34] some people get so upset

[1:28:40] when god speaks it's forever settled in
[1:28:43] heaven when god speaks to you you do
[1:28:45] what he tells you and when god speaks
[1:28:48] all hell moves that's everything that
[1:28:50] can stand
[1:28:52] in his presence
[1:28:55] i believe god still got a voice
[1:28:58] and god's got a people on earth today
[1:29:00] that'll live us out
[1:29:02] notice this about columba
[1:29:05] the messenger
[1:29:07] that after after the saint patrick had
[1:29:09] died
[1:29:11] that columba
[1:29:12] come on the scene
[1:29:14] he was born there in donegal ireland
[1:29:18] where our precious brother george
[1:29:20] our brother george quinn is there
[1:29:23] and notice about columbia that after he
[1:29:26] heard the voice of god
[1:29:28] nothing could stop him
[1:29:30] and his miraculous ministry had had
[1:29:32] caused many historians to acclaim
[1:29:36] him next to the apostles so great was
[1:29:39] his ministry with the supernatural
[1:29:41] science following that some especially
[1:29:43] students in rome have thought the
[1:29:45] accounts were exaggerated
[1:29:50] in one of his missionary journeys
[1:29:52] he approached a walled city he found the
[1:29:55] gates barred against him he lifted his
[1:29:57] voice in prayer that god might intervene
[1:30:00] and allow him to access the people in
[1:30:02] order to preach
[1:30:04] but as he prayed the court magicians
[1:30:06] began to harass him with loud voices he
[1:30:09] then to begin to sing a psalm
[1:30:11] as he's saying god so increased the
[1:30:13] volume of his voice that he drowned out
[1:30:16] the cries of the heathen and suddenly
[1:30:18] the gates burst open on their own accord
[1:30:25] what a messenger
[1:30:26] he entered in and preached the gospel
[1:30:29] winning many souls to the lord
[1:30:31] on another occasion when he was also
[1:30:33] shut out from the village as he turned
[1:30:35] away to depart the son of the chief of
[1:30:38] the village
[1:30:40] suddenly became violently ill even unto
[1:30:43] death and saint columba was quickly
[1:30:45] sought after and recalled when he prayed
[1:30:48] the prayer of faith the boy was
[1:30:50] instantly healed and the village was
[1:30:52] then opened to the evangelization of the
[1:30:55] gospel
[1:30:59] hallelujah
[1:31:00] if he could stand there with a closed
[1:31:03] book
[1:31:04] he could pray he could preach he could
[1:31:06] sing how much more should we
[1:31:09] standing in a day with an open book
[1:31:13] with the mysteries being revealed
[1:31:15] how much more should we break these
[1:31:17] strongholds
[1:31:19] how much more should we press against
[1:31:21] the gate
[1:31:22] how much more should we listen to this
[1:31:24] voice

[1:36:22] hallelujah
[1:36:25] we believe he's here this morning
[1:36:28] hallelujah
[1:36:32] could you imagine
[1:36:34] could you imagine how jesus felt
[1:36:38] when he's standing there and the
[1:36:40] scoffers
[1:36:41] passed him by
[1:36:44] that broke out
[1:36:46] their rules they broke out their
[1:36:47] regulations
[1:36:49] and jesus
[1:36:50] was nothing but a common man to them
[1:36:54] that was blaspheming what they called
[1:36:56] was a holy ghost
[1:36:58] and they missed him
[1:37:00] they missed him they measured him
[1:37:02] according to their statures
[1:37:05] and wondered
[1:37:06] now this can't be him
[1:37:08] and they missed him
[1:37:09] can you imagine how jesus felt
[1:37:12] when they turned him down when he was
[1:37:14] the one that was speaking that i and the
[1:37:16] father are one and they missed him
[1:37:21] but could you imagine
[1:37:23] how jesus failed in revelations chapter
[1:37:26] 1
[1:37:26] as he's standing there as jesus is
[1:37:29] walking in the midst of the seven golden
[1:37:31] candlesticks as he's walking there
[1:37:33] holding the seven stars in his right
[1:37:36] hand his hand of power
[1:37:38] as he's holding them and each of them
[1:37:40] represent a messenger of the day and he
[1:37:42] has so built that messenger that they
[1:37:45] would be characterized to each age that
[1:37:47] they would be built in such a way that
[1:37:49] it would attract the attention of the
[1:37:51] bride in that day
[1:37:53] he built them in such a way can you
[1:37:55] imagine as he would release the first
[1:37:57] messenger and he would go out and he
[1:37:59] would go out with that message and it
[1:38:01] would bring in he would go out and he
[1:38:03] would pull in the elective that day
[1:38:06] could you imagine how jesus felt knowing
[1:38:09] that they were in his hand that he had
[1:38:11] so molded them that they would be built
[1:38:14] according to the nature that he placed
[1:38:16] in them that they would bring in
[1:38:19] he would release he would release the
[1:38:21] second messenger the third message or
[1:38:23] the fourth messenger

[1:38:27] handiwork
[1:38:28] as he's standing there
[1:38:30] as that messenger has been dipped in
[1:38:32] that oil

[1:38:43] power he's got the same word you imagine
[1:38:46] how jesus is watching how all of these
[1:38:48] things are playing out this is how i
[1:38:50] predestined it this is how it's been
[1:38:52] ordained this is how it's going to go
[1:38:55] and jesus watches as the elect come to
[1:38:58] that word as they come to that message
[1:39:00] as they get pulled in by the message of
[1:39:02] that day
[1:39:05] could you imagine
[1:39:07] in this day
[1:39:09] when he's watching the final messenger
[1:39:12] roll off of his fingertips
[1:39:16] hallelujah
[1:39:17] as he's watching as william branham goes
[1:39:20] and he goes out and he releases william
[1:39:22] branham with certain characteristics
[1:39:24] with a certain message that will attract
[1:39:27] the people of the last day that she will
[1:39:29] receive this message and she will hear
[1:39:31] this as the final message that this that
[1:39:34] she will receive that message she will
[1:39:36] be a final voice to the final age that
[1:39:39] she will be a people in action
