[54:54] anyway so amen man God bless you could
[54:57] we stand to our feet this
[55:02] morning if you will turn with me to Luke
[55:04] chapter 22 and verse
[55:16] 31 Luke chapter 22 and verse 31
[55:29] amen don't you love him amen Luke chap
[55:33] 22:31 this very familiar portion of
[55:36] scripture and the Lord said Simon
[55:42] Simon behold Satan hath desired to have
[55:46] you that he might sift you as
[55:50] wheat I love these next words but I have
[55:53] prayed for
[55:54] you that thy faith fail not and when
[55:58] thou art converted strengthen thy
[56:01] Brethren and he said unto them Lord I am
[56:04] ready to go with thee both into prison
[56:07] and to
[56:08] death and he said I tell thee Peter the
[56:12] shall not Crow this day before Thou
[56:18] shalt Thrice deny that thou knowest me
[56:23] Luke 7 and verse 18
[56:31] and this is this Catches Us all right
[56:34] here for I know that that in me that is
[56:38] in my flesh dwelleth no good
[56:43] thing let's read that scripture with us
[56:46] for I know that in me that is in my
[56:50] flesh dwelleth no good
[56:55] thing wives look over to your husband
[56:57] said it's a
[57:01] truth for to will is depress with me but
[57:05] how to perform that which is good I find
[57:09] not for the good that I would do I do
[57:13] not but the evil which I would do I
[57:17] would not that I do now if I do that I
[57:22] would not it is no more that I do it it
[57:26] but that sin dwelleth in me I findeth
[57:30] then a law that when I would do good
[57:34] evil is present with me for I Delight in
[57:38] the law of God that after the word the
[57:41] inward man but I see another law in my
[57:44] members Waring against the law of my
[57:47] mind bringing me into captivity to the
[57:51] law of sin which is in my
[57:53] members oh Wretched Man that I I am who
[57:57] shall deliver me from the body of this
[58:00] death I thank God through Jesus Christ
[58:03] Our Lord so then with with the mind I
[58:08] myself serve the law of God but with the
[58:11] flesh the law of sin Romans chapter 8
[58:15] and verse one then we'll have our seats
[58:18] there is therefore now no condemnation
[58:21] to them which are in Christ Jesus who
[58:24] walk not after the flesh
[58:26] but after the spirit let's read that
[58:29] together if we
[58:40] will amen you can be
[58:47] seated what an awesome job brother
[58:49] Andrew did last night amen hallu I I I
[58:53] had some notes down I was going to I was
[58:56] going to share with you about the offer
[58:59] that was made to brother Andrew on in a
[59:01] job situation I actually sat in the same
[59:05] room at the same table and you know many
[59:09] times people will be made a lot of
[59:12] offers in their life Satan will make you
[59:14] an
[59:16] offer he made Jesus an offer I've been
[59:19] made
[59:20] offers and as I sat there and listened
[59:23] to the offers that Andrew was
[59:26] was offered that day and and you think
[59:29] about sometimes mindboggling money how
[59:33] it would change your life how it would
[59:34] change your family how it would change
[59:36] your children's life and then the the
[59:40] things that go with it and I sat quietly
[59:44] and I I I talked with the officers of of
[59:47] the company and I spoke to them a bit
[59:50] and we were there probably a couple
[59:52] hours and and uh we were there on a on a
[59:55] different project but they offered him
[59:58] that and
[1:00:00] so we drove about 3 hours in the truck
[1:00:04] together total
[1:00:08] silence and as we drove and we got to
[1:00:11] afon
[1:00:12] Mountain Andrew I was driving and Andrew
[1:00:17] said Dad I can't take that job I said
[1:00:21] yeah I know you can't take it son but I
[1:00:24] couldn't tell you you couldn't take it
[1:00:27] you have to put God first in your life
[1:00:30] there'll be a lot of things that you
[1:00:32] have to do in life that you know it
[1:00:34] would have been easier if you'd have
[1:00:36] taken the easier way on but money is not
[1:00:42] everything and at the end of the day God
[1:00:46] pays all his
[1:00:50] debts you've been serving the lord for
[1:00:52] quite a little while he'll he'll pay his
[1:00:54] debts don't you worry he don't get
[1:00:57] behind on his bills either amen God
[1:01:00] bless you God bless you today today I'd
[1:01:02] like to speak to you on death of an old
[1:01:05] friend oh
[1:01:09] yeah they probably need just a little
[1:01:11] bit more sound if I could get
[1:01:14] it my voice seems to be weak this
[1:01:18] morning I had an old friend and I I'd
[1:01:21] like to invite you to the funeral this
[1:01:24] morning dearly beloved beloved we are
[1:01:26] gathered together today for the memory
[1:01:29] of of this
[1:01:31] man this man was born 1961 on on August
[1:01:35] the 26th 8th month of the
[1:01:38] year he was about 7 PB and 6 o and short
[1:01:43] that's the way it'd be the rest of his
[1:01:46] life but on but this fell he is going to
[1:01:51] have all the sins of his
[1:01:53] father his mother his
[1:01:57] grandparents all of the generations
[1:01:59] before him of humanity is going to be
[1:02:03] passed down into his DNA that's
[1:02:06] right being born in a Minister's home
[1:02:09] doesn't give you any
[1:02:11] difference than anybody
[1:02:13] elseu being born in a certain belief
[1:02:16] doesn't give you any difference than
[1:02:17] anybody elseu the scriptures tells us
[1:02:20] that you must be born again amen
[1:02:26] you must be born again and so when
[1:02:30] you're you know when you're born in this
[1:02:33] life nobody has to have a class on
[1:02:36] teaching you how to
[1:02:40] lie nobody has to have a class on
[1:02:43] teaching you how to think the wrong
[1:02:46] thoughts or even say the wrong
[1:02:49] words nobody has to teach you how to do
[1:02:52] the wrong things in life it comes in
[1:02:55] your sinful nature that you're born with
[1:02:58] now we know that that kind of Flesh or
[1:03:01] that kind of a spirit cannot inherit the
[1:03:03] kingdom of God that's right because you
[1:03:07] are here what you will be somewhere else
[1:03:12] a liar here is a liar there an adulter
[1:03:16] here is an adulter there so there has to
[1:03:19] be a break in the
[1:03:22] chain now whether you realize or not
[1:03:25] everyone of us were born
[1:03:29] stinkers every one of us were born
[1:03:32] stinkers there was a lot of things that
[1:03:34] were cute about us when we were little
[1:03:38] children but sometimes those cute little
[1:03:41] things became our
[1:03:46] weaknesses now you know sometimes I know
[1:03:48] we've got some uh new Christians Among
[1:03:51] Us and brother Dylan you'll enjoy this
[1:03:53] this Parts it's things that you remember
[1:03:57] you look like the same guy that used to
[1:03:59] drink and do the ugly things of life you
[1:04:03] look exactly like that guy as a matter
[1:04:05] of fact you have the same address as
[1:04:08] that guy had this
[1:04:10] body and and you you look the same you
[1:04:15] you you kind of you go through life the
[1:04:17] same but there's a new king that comes
[1:04:20] on your
[1:04:22] heart now let me let me just say this
[1:04:25] for for a real Christian you don't have
[1:04:27] to make yourself do
[1:04:30] anything so many times people will say
[1:04:32] well you know if I you know if I become
[1:04:35] a Christian I'm going to lose so much
[1:04:37] well you just don't know how much you're
[1:04:38] going to
[1:04:42] gain now let's just say if you were a
[1:04:45] smoker you're you're no doubt going to
[1:04:48] lose that that part of cancer that you
[1:04:50] would have got oh yeah if you were a
[1:04:52] drunker uh no doubt your your liver
[1:04:55] going to be better off so you're going
[1:04:57] to lose that and and you're going to
[1:05:00] you're going to gain some brain cells
[1:05:02] and you're going to need
[1:05:04] them you're going to need them and
[1:05:06] you're probably going to have a a better
[1:05:11] marriage are you with me you know I am
[1:05:15] always interested in always this always
[1:05:18] tickles me just a little bit you know
[1:05:21] when we become Christians then we we
[1:05:23] find out that we go to church and then
[1:05:25] God ask us to to give back 10% of our
[1:05:29] earnings and you know at first the enemy
[1:05:31] will just tell you you know uh that's so
[1:05:34] selfish that's so ugly and you know uh
[1:05:38] why should you have to work and then
[1:05:40] give back your money what you don't
[1:05:42] realize that the devil
[1:05:45] before when he was the king of the heart
[1:05:48] he took way more than
[1:05:53] 10% and I've looked back in my life life
[1:05:55] and I've never found the dividends that
[1:05:57] came on top of the
[1:06:01] 10% and so and so you see you you I you
[1:06:05] know you're standing in a grocery store
[1:06:07] and all of a sudden somebody's buying uh
[1:06:10] just just a couple days ago I was
[1:06:12] standing and and I was needing some
[1:06:14] sugar so Matthew dropped me at 711 and
[1:06:18] and there was a guy buying some he was
[1:06:20] buying some
[1:06:22] uh some cigarettes and and some
[1:06:26] chew and and he spent about 30
[1:06:30] bucks and I thought
[1:06:33] man man that's a slave driver that'll
[1:06:35] take 30 bucks just for
[1:06:38] that and I I was standing there with a
[1:06:41] Hershey bar and a and a
[1:06:44] Cocola and and it rang up
[1:06:47] $33.19 for the Hershey bar and I said no
[1:06:50] I I don't believe I need that as bad as
[1:06:52] I thought I did
[1:06:58] I'll just take the Coke and down it real
[1:07:02] quick but but when life you begin to
[1:07:05] realize that God pays dividends than
[1:07:08] Lord on top of it all what happens to
[1:07:12] our
[1:07:13] sin what happens to those things that
[1:07:16] were taken that was in our lives what
[1:07:19] took place well where did they go
[1:07:22] brother Brandon would explain it like
[1:07:23] this it's kind of like a drop of ink
[1:07:25] that's right and and and that color that
[1:07:28] was there that it's dropped into a
[1:07:33] bleach and it becomes so broken down you
[1:07:36] can't tell the difference between what
[1:07:39] is bleach and what is
[1:07:41] ink even God cannot find our sins
[1:07:46] today because it has been dropped in the
[1:07:48] most precious thing that there's ever
[1:07:51] been the blood of the Lamb of calvary
[1:07:55] our Lord Jesus Christ I want you to just
[1:07:58] think of the power of a drop of
[1:08:00] ink one drop of ink can sign your death
[1:08:04] warrant
[1:08:07] amen it can send you to the electric
[1:08:12] chair pretty powerful isn't it or one
[1:08:15] drop of ink can pardon you from all of
[1:08:20] your
[1:08:23] sins oh don't you love the Lord right
[1:08:25] there now notice this one that comes on
[1:08:28] the inside of
[1:08:30] you he's greater than every Power in the
[1:08:34] whole
[1:08:35] world he said what is in
[1:08:38] you he said he's greater it's Christ the
[1:08:41] anointed one God that was in Christ is
[1:08:46] now inside of
[1:08:48] you greater is he that is in you than he
[1:08:52] that is in the world Amen I love you
[1:08:55] that don't you he said then if he is in
[1:08:59] you it's not you anymore living it's him
[1:09:04] living on the inside of
[1:09:07] you he said what do you think about this
[1:09:09] what do you think about that then if he
[1:09:11] is in you he absolutely will not deny
[1:09:15] what he said he couldn't do it he says
[1:09:19] but he would keep what he said and he is
[1:09:22] trying to find a person that he can
[1:09:24] vindicate at himself
[1:09:26] through Isaiah 55 and verse 6 it said
[1:09:31] seek ye the Lord while he may be
[1:09:34] found call ye upon him while he is
[1:09:38] near let the wicked forsake his way and
[1:09:41] the unrighteous man his thoughts and let
[1:09:44] him return unto the Lord and He will
[1:09:46] have mercy upon him and to our God and
[1:09:49] he will
[1:09:50] abundantly pardon Lord notice these next
[1:09:55] words
[1:09:56] for my thoughts are not your
[1:10:00] thoughts neither are your ways my way
[1:10:04] sayeth the Lord for as as as the heavens
[1:10:07] are higher than the earth so are my ways
[1:10:11] higher than your ways and my thoughts
[1:10:15] than your
[1:10:17] thoughts brother Ron and I you want to
[1:10:19] know what I think about that not
[1:10:21] necessarily but I want to I want to know
[1:10:22] what God thinks about it amen
[1:10:25] the scripture and I in Psalms chapter 46
[1:10:28] and verse one God is our refuge
[1:10:34] yes and
[1:10:36] strength oppressing
[1:10:38] help in
[1:10:43] trouble 119 and verse 59 Psalms I
[1:10:47] thought on my
[1:10:49] ways and turn my feet to thy testimonies
[1:10:55] I want you to understand God finds his
[1:10:57] children in
[1:11:01] trouble sometimes you're a new convert
[1:11:04] you're walking in and you go brother Ron
[1:11:06] nobody's ever been in trouble before all
[1:11:08] of a sudden you're sitting with 250
[1:11:10] other people that's been where you're
[1:11:13] sitting all of us have been in trouble
[1:11:16] before generally that's the way God
[1:11:19] finds his kids in trouble why would it
[1:11:23] be like that because as long as you're
[1:11:26] in sin listen let's just say it sin is
[1:11:29] pleasurable for a
[1:11:30] season but then God starts knocking on
[1:11:33] your
[1:11:35] heart he starts knocking on your heart
[1:11:37] and he begins to turn the wheels of your
[1:11:40] life cuz he's got a bigger
[1:11:43] plan are you with me now if it wasn't
[1:11:46] for God you would live 60 70 years and
[1:11:49] you'd go by the the way of the grave and
[1:11:52] couple Generations later you're totally
[1:11:54] for
[1:11:56] forgotten if you live to the sin that's
[1:11:59] the way it'll be but just think you can
[1:12:02] go to a graveyard maybe where Paul's
[1:12:05] buried or irenius is buried or Columba
[1:12:08] I've been there Columbus's buried let me
[1:12:11] just say there's no doubt millionaires
[1:12:13] that were there quite rich people but if
[1:12:17] they didn't have
[1:12:20] God what you're looking at is a
[1:12:23] grave that was the end of their life and
[1:12:26] they'll spend through the eternities
[1:12:29] paying for the sin that they
[1:12:34] enjoyed for a season are you with me now
[1:12:37] but I want you to understand if you're a
[1:12:41] Christian whether it's a thousand years
[1:12:43] ago or 2,000 years ago you're raised up
[1:12:46] out of that
[1:12:48] grave and live to live an eternal life
[1:12:53] with Jesus Christ
[1:12:57] L the scripture says that he that cometh
[1:13:00] to
[1:13:01] me in no wise will I cast him out we
[1:13:06] understand that no man can come to God
[1:13:09] except God draws
[1:13:12] him I find it amazing that two people
[1:13:15] can sit in the same service and one gets
[1:13:18] quick to the spirit of God and the other
[1:13:21] one is bored out of their mind
[1:13:26] yeah are you with me I found people that
[1:13:29] were here maybe you're here today that
[1:13:32] literally you were getting ready to walk
[1:13:33] out of the service and said I'll never
[1:13:35] go back there again but when you turned
[1:13:38] and walked out you found yourself at the
[1:13:42] altar because God wouldn't let you
[1:13:47] go I'm thankful brother
[1:13:49] Roger I'm thankful that he
[1:13:53] overrode my own
[1:13:57] Ambitions I'm thankful that he overrode
[1:14:00] my thoughts of life and Quicken me and
[1:14:04] in spite of
[1:14:09] myself in spite of myself he loved
[1:14:13] me are you with me I know you're trying
[1:14:17] to find some people unlovable oh
[1:14:21] yeah you've met a few of those in your
[1:14:23] life but there was a time that no doubt
[1:14:26] you was
[1:14:28] unlovable and yet in spite of your
[1:14:30] condition of being unlovable God loved
[1:14:40] you brother Gabriel is doing some some
[1:14:44] video work he did it with brother George
[1:14:46] and then he he's did it with brother
[1:14:48] Shannon and he's did it for brother
[1:14:49] Dylan he's done with some of the others
[1:14:52] I love to hear the testimonies amen the
[1:14:55] testimonies of the journey that they
[1:14:57] were
[1:14:58] on but God rich in
[1:15:03] mercy God rich in Mercy turned us
[1:15:07] around how much blood did it
[1:15:10] take the same amount of blood for
[1:15:13] someone that sits in
[1:15:15] church and has never went out there
[1:15:19] listen for the scripture said all have
[1:15:22] sinned
[1:15:25] and come short of the glory of
[1:15:28] God are you with me that keeps us all
[1:15:31] from having a stuffed
[1:15:35] shirt notice Jesus tells Simon the lead
[1:15:39] disciple I have prayed for
[1:15:43] you I have prayed for you that thy faith
[1:15:48] fail thee not Satan has a desire that he
[1:15:52] can shift you like wheat
[1:15:55] amen he desires he has an ambition that
[1:15:59] he could destroy you but I prayed for
[1:16:03] you listen listen let me just say that
[1:16:06] can be your scripture Satan has a desire
[1:16:09] to destroy
[1:16:11] you he comes to kill to steal and
[1:16:15] destroy he's nobody that you want to
[1:16:18] negotiate with yet he will paint
[1:16:22] pictures that the grass is greener on
[1:16:25] the other side he will make sin look so
[1:16:35] alluring the maral barel guy with his
[1:16:38] cowboy
[1:16:41] hat looking like a real
[1:16:47] man sitting on a
[1:16:50] horse look like a real man he don't show
[1:16:55] you
[1:17:01] cancer he'll show you the the mountain
[1:17:05] Waters of
[1:17:07] Colorado going into your core's
[1:17:11] beer and don't tell you there coming out
[1:17:13] of the water right up
[1:17:17] here of the shanoa
[1:17:20] valley somewhere they forget that in
[1:17:22] their commercials
[1:17:32] David conquered many
[1:17:34] wars I love last night because it goes
[1:17:37] today he conquered many
[1:17:40] wars he conquered many
[1:17:42] enemies but he couldn't conquer himself
[1:17:48] amen he wanted to build God a
[1:17:51] tabernacle but because of blood that he
[1:17:54] had shed even innocent blood God would
[1:17:58] refused him think about this God that
[1:18:02] had fellip with him God that had gave
[1:18:05] him incredible victories would not allow
[1:18:08] him to build the temple he saved it that
[1:18:13] Solomon would build build that Temple
[1:18:16] that's right but let me just say this to
[1:18:18] you David so wanted the life of God to
[1:18:24] live in side of
[1:18:26] him notice he would write the
[1:18:29] Commandments and put it on his head tied
[1:18:33] into his into his into his hair he
[1:18:36] wanted and made vows but he couldn't
[1:18:39] make it
[1:18:40] live he can make vows he could make
[1:18:43] promises he could make all kind of Oaths
[1:18:46] but Le on the inside of him he had a
[1:18:49] sinful
[1:18:53] nature listen you can join 42
[1:18:57] churches you can sign hundreds of books
[1:19:00] but until Christ come on your
[1:19:03] [Applause]
[1:19:08] heart David desired he wrote the
[1:19:12] songs about the presence of
[1:19:16] God and he
[1:19:19] longed that which he lacked he longed to
[1:19:24] have his life living inside of him oh
[1:19:27] yes Samson what a man that he could have
[1:19:31] been if he had the Holy Ghost in his
[1:19:34] life
[1:19:37] amen God chose him sure he
[1:19:42] did he chose David a murderer right a
[1:19:48] murderer now let me just say say this to
[1:19:51] you
[1:19:52] tonight God knew your sin before you
[1:19:55] ever committed
[1:19:59] them let's just let's just think real
[1:20:01] deep about this Blood God knew your sins
[1:20:05] your mistakes your
[1:20:07] failures before you ever did
[1:20:14] it well brother Ronda what's big about
[1:20:17] that he still called
[1:20:19] you thank Lord he still called
[1:20:23] you he still called you listen go ahead
[1:20:27] and say it he still called
[1:20:32] me the things that you wrestle about
[1:20:35] with your weaknesses and your failures
[1:20:38] God already knows
[1:20:44] it he already knows it but he's got a
[1:20:47] blood thank you Lord he's got a blood
[1:20:51] that'll take care of that
[1:20:55] are you with me now notice this you can
[1:21:00] sacrifice they'd all brought all kinds
[1:21:03] of blood of bulls and goats that during
[1:21:07] David's days and the Lambs and the
[1:21:09] turtle does they'd bring it to the
[1:21:11] priest and the blood would sprinkle back
[1:21:14] upon the believer the oncom and it would
[1:21:18] only cover him it wouldn't change his
[1:21:21] life it would only cover him and it
[1:21:25] would cover him for a
[1:21:27] year but this Holy
[1:21:30] Ghost this holy ghost that comes on a
[1:21:33] Believer it seals you till the day of
[1:21:37] [Applause]
[1:21:39] redemption now not notice this just
[1:21:41] before I get too far here I want you to
[1:21:44] understand in the three stages of the
[1:21:46] journey it's repentance that's right it
[1:21:50] is worth that you turn away from your
[1:21:52] sinful ways right it's to where that you
[1:21:56] make a
[1:21:59] decision you make the
[1:22:01] decision I'm not walking this way no
[1:22:05] more now this isn't something your
[1:22:08] parents can do for
[1:22:10] you this isn't something your favorite
[1:22:12] preacher can do for you this is
[1:22:15] something that you've got to do you got
[1:22:18] to ask God to forgive
[1:22:20] you you got to wave the white white flag
[1:22:24] of repentance and surrender I
[1:22:27] Surrender I'm tired of living with the
[1:22:29] Hogs I'm tired of living with the pigs
[1:22:32] I'm tired of being a
[1:22:35] slave I'm tired of this vessel going
[1:22:38] through all the ups and downs of sin I'm
[1:22:46] done now let me just say this you
[1:22:49] repentance is not
[1:22:52] like a credit card to where you get
[1:22:55] $25,000 paid off for
[1:22:57] you and then gives you a license to go
[1:23:01] put $25,000 more on

[1:28:37] day and so it come kind of to he could
[1:28:40] he could kind of tell
[1:28:41] that it wasn't exactly Landing well
[1:28:45] and you know he drove two hours I I felt
[1:28:48] like giving him whatever he wanted to
[1:28:50] say and he you know he come to a spot
[1:28:53] and he said yeah you remember those
[1:28:55] things and I said yeah I do I I
[1:28:58] shamefully
[1:28:59] do I said but
[1:29:02] Eddie I want to tell you
[1:29:05] something the run that you knew is
[1:29:14] deaden
[1:29:15] really I said yeah as a matter of fact
[1:29:17] we buried it
[1:29:24] yeah come on come on and there was a
[1:29:27] king that was on his
[1:29:29] heart that lived when you was around I
[1:29:32] know this is simple but I'm going there
[1:29:34] yeah the king that was here that lived
[1:29:38] here when when you were around that King
[1:29:43] died and there was a new king called
[1:29:46] Jesus came inside of this
[1:29:50] heart and this vessel had to repent and
[1:29:53] I and I had to be baptized in the name
[1:29:55] of the Lord Jesus Christ and then I
[1:29:58] became a candidate for the baptism of
[1:30:01] the Holy
[1:30:05] Ghost now I want you to understand I
[1:30:07] want you to understand something simple
[1:30:10] God will not live in a contaminated
[1:30:14] vessel where people have so many
[1:30:17] problems is trying to live two lives at
[1:30:19] the same
[1:30:22] time you ever heard of trying to live on
[1:30:24] the
[1:30:31] fence really there's no
[1:30:34] fence you're just blurring the
[1:30:37] lines are you with me now yeah listen
[1:30:41] let me let me just say this you the
[1:30:42] reason that you can live two different
[1:30:45] lives is because the king of the Heart
[1:30:47] Is Not
[1:30:49] Jesus are you with me now listen

[1:37:25] never get
[1:37:28] it Hallelujah so what happens to those
[1:37:31] old sins
[1:37:32] Dylan God's got to clear
[1:37:36] it he's got to clear it out of your life
[1:37:39] brother Joel oh but you don't know the
[1:37:42] old Joel I don't need to know the old
[1:37:46] Joel I don't need to know the old oh God
[1:37:51] God took care of that
[1:37:54] and it clears the deed how many's ever
[1:37:56] bought a piece of
[1:37:59] property you want to clear deed to go
[1:38:02] with that that's right because you can
[1:38:05] get a you can get a deed and get it
[1:38:07] signed but if it's got debts against it
[1:38:12] where somebody worked and they didn't
[1:38:14] get paid and they put a lean on the
[1:38:19] property that means that you're still
[1:38:22] liable
[1:38:25] for the account that's the reason you
[1:38:28] want a clear
[1:38:31] [Applause]
[1:38:32] deed God clears your
[1:38:37] deed he clears it up to where there's no
[1:38:41] more
[1:38:44] misunderstandings you say well brother
[1:38:45] Ron why is that so important amen we
[1:38:49] have an accuser of the
[1:38:52] Brethren absolutely
[1:38:54] and he's constantly telling you of your
[1:38:58] past he's constantly telling you even
[1:39:00] your
[1:39:03] thoughts he's constantly in your ear
[1:39:06] telling you all kind of bad
[1:39:09] things but he is the accuser of the bre
[1:39:12] and he's good at
[1:39:13] it but God's done a tital search on
[1:39:18] [Applause]
[1:39:20] you he's cleared the Deep
[1:39:23] are you with me first sealed the breach
[1:39:26] you can go through there and studied it
[1:39:27] all he's cleared the deed there's no
[1:39:30] more remembrance of
[1:39:33] sin the old nature is
[1:39:39] done and you become a new
[1:39:43] creature I need another example brother
[1:39:48] Ron Brother Randy none of us would like
[1:39:51] to be called a worm amen
[1:39:55] I think worms are disgusting only unless
[1:39:58] we're
[1:40:04] fishing I may make this crowd mad but
[1:40:06] I'm gonna tell them something every one
[1:40:09] of you were a
[1:40:13] worm every one of you I'm
[1:40:18] sorry crawl on the ground dir in your
[1:40:21] eyes yes your feet was swabbing like
[1:40:26] this but God didn't want to leave you as
[1:40:29] a
[1:40:31] worm or a caterpillar
[1:40:35] amen so he's got a process that he sends
[1:40:39] you through Gabriel and when he sends
[1:40:41] you through the
[1:40:43] process it's a cocoon that is formed and
[1:40:46] when the Cocoon is formed then after a
[1:40:49] process of time a transformation happens
[1:40:52] on the inside of that c
[1:40:53] cocoon and that cocoon begins to
[1:40:56] bust and it begins to
[1:40:59] crack and a
[1:41:02] butterly comes out of that now imagine
[1:41:06] imagine this you're a
[1:41:09] witness let me give a better
[1:41:11] example Abraham has been telling you
[1:41:14] that God's going to give you a son but
[1:41:17] you know as 100 years old you can never
[1:41:20] have that child Sarah's 90 years old
[1:41:25] brother meta is the only one who
[1:41:26] qualifies in the church to being kind of
[1:41:29] in that age bracket and he's not
[1:41:31] interested in having
[1:41:37] children somebody tell him tomorrow
[1:41:40] don't tell him now don't tell him
[1:41:47] now I find it absolutely amazing with
[1:41:50] brother metas amen he can't find the car
[1:41:53] that he came to church in but last night
[1:41:55] he was quoting quotes in front of
[1:42:09] Andrew now just think about
[1:42:11] this if you're a witness and you're
[1:42:14] watching Abraham he's given this
[1:42:15] testimony you've been his buddy for 25
[1:42:18] years and and he's he's been talking
[1:42:20] about I met God I I met God he's my
[1:42:22] shield he's my buckler he's my strength
[1:42:24] he's actually changed my name I'm not
[1:42:26] going to go by Abram anymore I'm going
[1:42:28] to go by Abraham God changed my name oh
[1:42:31] yeah I bet he did yeah yeah he did he
[1:42:34] changed my name from now on you call me
[1:42:36] Abraham so he told all of his friends
[1:42:38] you call me Abraham as a matter of fact
[1:42:41] the other day God came to the house
[1:42:43] really oh Hallelujah yeah God came to
[1:42:46] the house the other day Sarah was in the
[1:42:48] back of the tent and she was laughing
[1:42:50] because he was telling her that she was
[1:42:51] going to have a child and and he
[1:42:53] actually asked her is there anything too
[1:42:54] hard for the Lord and he said
[1:42:57] Sarah the way you spell your name that's
[1:43:00] a dominating female but let me change
[1:43:02] your name to where you're a princess I'm
[1:43:05] going to put h on the end of your
[1:43:08] name amen I'm going to put my own life
[1:43:11] on the inside of your name now you can
[1:43:15] meet the challenge of the hour amen the
[1:43:18] same critical friend has been with you
[1:43:20] all the time but maybe he lives on the
[1:43:23] same street on the day your body becomes
[1:43:29] young and want you don't realize youve
[1:43:32] went into the Cocoon of God's promises
[1:43:35] and all of a sudden you begin to walk
[1:43:38] out you used to be a real stinker but
[1:43:41] God's rich in Mercy you used to be real
[1:43:44] ugly in your life but God knows how to
[1:43:46] fix you thank you
[1:43:50] Lord now that friend has to go tell
[1:43:53] somebody else you know what happened to
[1:43:56] Abraham I don't know what happened man
[1:43:58] that guy's
[1:44:01] young I was talking to a man that was a
[1:44:04] a 12-year Bible student he was a pastor
[1:44:07] of a Baptist Church he was a friend of
[1:44:10] mine I said
[1:44:12] Mark what happened in the
[1:44:15] scriptures what happened in the
[1:44:16] scriptures to Abraham and Sarah that is
[1:44:19] so phenomenal he said yeah I know what
[1:44:21] happened I said said okay he said two of
[1:44:26] the oldest
[1:44:27] people have a
[1:44:29] boy I said that's pretty
[1:44:32] incredible I said have you ever read
[1:44:35] where he goes down to
[1:44:38] Greer he gets out of the will of the
[1:44:40] Lord and he goes to
[1:44:42] Greer and these two old people the king
[1:44:46] of that country finds her to be the most
[1:44:49] beautiful woman in the world
[1:44:53] amen I said I never looked at it quite
[1:44:56] like that I said none of us did until
[1:44:59] the
[1:45:00] seals and God was showing us that there
[1:45:02] was going to be a bride that was going
[1:45:04] to get a change of the
[1:45:07] body he's not going to leave us grhe
[1:45:16] headed I find it phenomenal that
[1:45:19] Satan has a great big list
[1:45:23] of all your
[1:45:25] mistakes even yours has a great big list
[1:45:29] of all your mistakes and it brings it
[1:45:32] before God and before he can get to God
[1:45:35] you go father forgive me of my sins
[1:45:40] forgive me of even the thoughts that I
[1:45:42] that I think forgive me of my wrong
[1:45:45] attitudes yeah I'm talking to you in the
[1:45:46] green
[1:45:47] Church raise your
[1:45:49] hand I mean a guy like you don't look
[1:45:51] like a guy like that with sin does it
[1:45:53] but he's a
[1:45:55] human and all humans come short no
[1:45:59] matter if you come to church every week
[1:46:01] every
[1:46:03] year you got a scripture for that Paul
[1:46:05] said I Die
[1:46:10] daily Paul the messenger of the hour
[1:46:14] says I Die daily and you ask God to
[1:46:18] forgive
[1:46:19] you you don't feel lightened
[1:46:24] you don't hear
[1:46:26] thunder you feel no angels in the room
[1:46:30] but you being a Son of God ask God the
[1:46:34] faithful high priest to forgive you of
[1:46:36] your
[1:46:38] sins and in a moment it's
[1:46:42] gone it's kind of unfair to the devil he
[1:46:44] goes up there with a great big list and
[1:46:46] it's all gone
[1:46:55] I think that's
[1:46:58] phenomenal brother Ron preach me
[1:47:00] something really deep I really
[1:47:06] am
[1:47:09] now what if we couldn't have the Holy
[1:47:11] Ghost
[1:47:14] amen we'd live in haunted
[1:47:19] houses haunted by our past
[1:47:24] living in the realm of regret that's
[1:47:27] right we really
[1:47:30] would how many's ever been in a haunted
[1:47:33] house well there's some honest ones here
[1:47:38] today I lived in
[1:47:42] one I lived in one I knew what was
[1:47:46] right and I couldn't do it in my
[1:47:49] condition so I was haunted where I lived
[1:47:54] at listen this is more than Barney F in
[1:47:58] a haunted
[1:48:00] house where doors are screeching and
[1:48:02] windows are wrinkling and and the roof
[1:48:05] is falling
[1:48:06] off listen a lot of people live with
[1:48:10] Spooks I'm coming now I'm coming down
[1:48:13] the Avenue I'm
[1:48:14] coming a lot of people live with Spooks
[1:48:18] let me just say this you to live with
[1:48:20] your own Pride
[1:48:22] is a spooky
[1:48:25] Spirit it comes right straight from
[1:48:29] Lucifer Pride will keep you from getting
[1:48:32] right with
[1:48:33] God that's right Pride human
[1:48:39] Pride will keep you from getting right
[1:48:42] with
[1:48:44] God because it will justify you in your
[1:48:48] sins well I'm not as bad as the other
[1:48:51] guy listen we're not here comparing
[1:48:53] oursel with one
[1:49:03] another listen I don't want to stand at
[1:49:05] the Judgment bar and say well somebody
[1:49:08] at the church was doing the same thing I
[1:49:09] was doing so I thought it would be
[1:49:12] okay don't hang your
[1:49:16] soul over an excuse
[1:49:28] Romans 8 I just read it to you and I'll
[1:49:30] finish at this point and pick it up next
[1:49:32] week Romans chapter 8 says there is
[1:49:35] therefore now no
[1:49:39] condemnation condemnation is something
[1:49:42] that will constantly beat you like a
[1:49:44] slave
[1:49:53] let me give you an example the devil
[1:49:55] will talk you into Robin
[1:49:58] bank and then he'll call a
[1:50:09] law you'll find yourself on the wrong
[1:50:16] website you're young you're checking
[1:50:19] things out and all of a sudden you're on
[1:50:21] the wrong website I took my glasses off
[1:50:23] cuz I can't see
[1:50:25] you you're on the wrong
[1:50:28] website and all of a sudden the devil
[1:50:31] that has led you there now condemns you
[1:50:35] for
[1:50:36] it if your mama only knew if your daddy
[1:50:38] only knew the preacher only
[1:50:41] [Music]
[1:50:43] knew are you with me now the enemy the
[1:50:47] accuser of the Brethren will lead you
[1:50:50] into all that nonsense
[1:51:03] brother random would talk about another
[1:51:05] one called
[1:51:07] a
[1:51:12] uh he talk about another one to where
[1:51:15] that you can't forgive
[1:51:20] yourself listen
[1:51:23] if you can't forgive
[1:51:25] yourself you'll have trouble forgiving
[1:51:32] others are you with me if you can't
[1:51:35] forgive
[1:51:36] yourself but as a matter of fact let me
[1:51:39] flip that around for you if you can't
[1:51:41] forgive others neither can God forgive
[1:51:50] you I would hate to come to the end of
[1:51:52] the
[1:51:54] road and have excuses for doing a lot of
[1:51:57] things to serve God because I couldn't
[1:52:01] forgive
[1:52:02] myself of little stumbles in my
[1:52:08] life I want to come back to it
[1:52:14] here brother brandom is going to be the
[1:52:16] messenger of the
[1:52:18] age he's going to be the messenger
[1:52:22] not up for debate it's going to be the
[1:52:26] messenger the first time that God speaks
[1:52:28] to him he is carrying water to his
[1:52:33] father's whiskey
[1:52:36] steel he's six years old of course he
[1:52:40] don't know all the ramifications of what
[1:52:42] he's doing the presence of God comes
[1:52:45] down in brother Vernon whirls in the in
[1:52:49] the trees and begins to speak out of
[1:52:51] that tree never drink Never Smoke defile
[1:52:55] your body I've got a work for you to
[1:52:58] do real
[1:53:03] simple God didn't come down and condemn
[1:53:06] him for carrying water to the
[1:53:10] steel he
[1:53:12] knew what was sitting on your table when
[1:53:16] I came to see
[1:53:19] you he knows where you're at
[1:53:23] and he's not
[1:53:27] ashamed Connie I think it's so
[1:53:30] phenomenal he
[1:53:33] went to a Pharisees house not to be
[1:53:37] entertained by Pharisees but there was a
[1:53:40] woman that was come amen sir that had a
[1:53:44] history
[1:53:46] amen
[1:53:47] amen Tracy she had a history that none
[1:53:50] of the church would have wanted
[1:53:53] she was a
[1:53:54] prostitute and Jesus knew that she was
[1:53:58] coming and she sold her very best that's
[1:54:02] right to get the ointment that was way
[1:54:05] costly amen and she finds herself at
[1:54:09] Jesus's feet washing his feet and
[1:54:14] anointing his feet with that with that
[1:54:18] perfume and drying his feet from the
[1:54:21] tears with her
[1:54:30] he
[1:54:31] knew but he's not going to leave her
[1:54:34] where he left
[1:54:38] herall brother Josh he don't leave you
[1:54:41] where he found you at
[1:54:52] brother Roger you may have been a
[1:54:54] stinker yes you
[1:54:57] was but he didn't leave you where he
[1:55:00] found
[1:55:01] you he didn't say that's the rest of the
[1:55:04] story he picked you
[1:55:08] up and when there's no more town called
[1:55:10] Gros when there's no more millionaires
[1:55:13] in the state of Virginia you'll still be
[1:55:16] a son of God
[1:55:19] [Applause]
[1:55:29] let me just say this to you I'm GNA
[1:55:30] borrow this from Timothy puit and end it
[1:55:32] with
[1:55:33] this The Burning
[1:55:37] Bush was a light that brought
[1:55:43] change it was a light that brought
[1:55:45] change you heard it when he preached
[1:55:48] here on on Friday night of our Labor Day
[1:55:50] meeting and he was talking about how
[1:55:53] that when you come into His
[1:55:56] presence that light takes care of all
[1:55:59] the darkness that is on the inside of
[1:56:02] you literally let me just say this to
[1:56:05] you when you walk to an altar whether
[1:56:08] the enemy wants to know it or not you
[1:56:11] bring your enemy to the place that he's
[1:56:14] going to die
[1:56:18] at you literally walked your slave
[1:56:21] master right to the
[1:56:24] Altar and that's the place to where he
[1:56:27] dies on the inside of your life and you
[1:56:31] can say it's
[1:56:34] over it's over it's
[1:56:43] over let me let me just preface with
[1:56:48] this once he's dead his effect is over
[1:56:54] hallu his addiction is over his desire
[1:56:58] is
[1:56:59] over and once Jesus lives
[1:57:02] there his effect is always with you amen
[1:57:07] and when you do something a little bit
[1:57:10] wrong he's quick to kind of nudge you
[1:57:14] and you know it's not right and you go
[1:57:18] I'm
[1:57:19] sorry Lord forgive me
[1:57:22] I did not mean to hurt your feelings

[2:01:49] Ghost and God won't live in you and put
[2:01:52] a seal on you until he's living on the
[2:01:56] inside of you and if he's living on the
[2:01:59] inside of
