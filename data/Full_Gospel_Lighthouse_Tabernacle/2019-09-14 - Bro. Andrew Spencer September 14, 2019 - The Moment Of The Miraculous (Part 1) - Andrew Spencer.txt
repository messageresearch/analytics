amongst us he believed that's mine you're standing in his presence [Music] ha [Music] [Music] [Laughter] March army [Music] [Applause] [Music] Matthew chapter 9 and verse 18 a man thank you musicians a man what a wonderful day to serve our Lord Jesus Christ amen tonight I'd like to speak to you on a thought maybe depending on how the Lord leads us this evening we speak to you this weekend on this Lord on the moment the moment of the miraculous the moment of the miraculous Matthew chapter 9 and verse 18 while he spake these things unto them behold there came a certain ruler and worshipped him saying my daughter is even now we would say this moment is even now this moment did but come and lay thy hand upon her and she shall live and Jesus arose and followed him and so did his disciples and behold a woman which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years came behind him and touched the hem of His garment and she said within herself if I may be touch His garment I shall be made home but Jesus turned him about and when he saw her he said daughter be of good comfort thy faith had made the whole and the woman was made whole from that hour and when Jesus came into the ruler's house and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise he said unto them give place for the maid is not dead but sleepeth and they laughed him to scorn but when the people were put forth he went in and took her by the hand and the maid arose and the fame here of went abroad into all that land a man may God bless his word he may be seated in the presence of the Lord we're reading here out of the Gospel of st. Matthew and as we have read this evening we can read this in several different accounts reading of my Matthew over in Matthew chapter 9 and then also in March after file than Luke chapter 8 usually when when you hear that reading it you will read it from mark chapter you're most acquainted with the the reading of mark chapter 5 and where Jesus walks in but here here the writer of Matthew he puts you as as you the reader he automatically puts you into a spot where you can where you can you can view from his point of view that here here the the daughter of the ruler was a now dead and so now you're automatically captivated by the writers were writing here that that Jarius his daughter however you say jar eyes or Jarius however you choose to say it but his daughter was his daughter was now dead at this moment and we are looking into a spot in in Jerez his life where where he is in a spot or a moment of agony and there's as we have read this evening there's many different moments that we have read over there's moments of agony there's there's moments of pain and moments of desperation and then there's when you look at the woman with the blood issue that there's a moment of perseverance a moment of desperation a moments of determination and then we see that there is a moment there's moments of the miraculous and that's where we want to deal with tonight on on the moment of the miraculous and we as sons and daughters of God and I trust that that is your that is your speech tonight that that is your testimony in your confession that you are a son of God and a daughter of God but there's been many times in your life that that you know that there are certain moments of miraculous that have taken place maybe nobody else understands your moment but you had that moment where you know that it was only you and God in the building and maybe maybe the building was filled with 500 people but it was your moment you were living and you were having a conference with a living God and he was speaking directly to you and maybe you were pressing through a crowd of 500 just to get to the hem of his garment but but but yet you chose to reach out in that moment and touch the hem of His garment while he was passing by your faith reach out and touch him and we believe that the Bible tells us that he's the same yesterday today and forever and and if he is the same that means that we can reach out and touch him tonight maybe maybe we were not looking for him in the same form but we know that he's here because his word said that he would be here he told us that that he'd never leave us that he never forsake us and he would be even in us to the end of the world and I'd say that sometimes you know we come to church many times we come to church maybe sometimes it's out of tradition but I trust that's not your confession but you come out to church to draw strength from God you you come to church for because you have a need in your life you come to church because you recognize that you need to be free refilled with the have baptism of the Holy Ghost and you need you need to get filled up with the nutriment nutrients to to change this body and to to to put on this and to put on the body of him corruption you you come to church and you're looking for that moment of the miraculous I'd say there's some times that we go to the house of God and we feel like nobody I like nothing is coming by our way and sometimes we're expecting we come to church and we're expecting God to move and sometimes we come to church just because the rest of the family came to church but and you know sometimes we walk in the house of God and we walk right in and maybe maybe it's just like another service and maybe the song leaders going through the motions and you're sitting there yet you're clapping your hands and you're lifti you're lifting your hand and yet you're doing that and you're you're fighting through laodicea you you just came off the work week and you're battling in your mind just to get something out of service and maybe it look like he wasn't gonna have a breakthrough but all of a sudden there came a rushing mighty wind and in that moment it was like a miracle took place it was like nobody a you look around and nobody else has got their hands up or nobody else's screaming or nobody else is flapping their hands or nobody else is feeling what you're feeling but it was your moment I wonder if there's anybody in the house of God tonight that's ever had a moment like that that they that they realized that there was more than a man that was speaking to them there was more than a man that was operating there was more than a man that was using a microphone that was more than a man that was that was speaking to hearts I believe that that this has Christians these are the moments that we live for you know we don't always go around that we're not we're taught that a weak and adulterous generation seeks after silence but we're not here looking at seeking after miracles are asking after miracles but we know that God gives miracles we know that God is a miracle worker so we can look for miracles and you know another man would say he said many times you see people that's happy and rejoicing and full of the Spirit of God where divine healings and powers and wonders and miracles are performed then they say it's hypnotism they say it's this that or the other but if you'll recognize if you only read the Bible you'll see it's the Lord Jesus you just don't recognize him you just don't realize who it is how many times how many people have walked in here maybe you brought somebody in you're a witnessing to them and the very first time they walked into service and and we had one of those Holy Ghost breakout service where everybody was screaming and you were sitting there thinking oh my I invited them on the wrong night but you know God has a way of working everything out just perfectly you see you think you've got it in control where you've got these moments figured out well I'll invite them on Sunday night or Saturday night with a certain preachers preaching but you know God has the ability to take a vessel of God and go down a certain course and and speak directly to their address if anybody can believe that God can do that we certainly should be able to believe as as sons and daughters of God and believers of the message that God could take a human instrument and take him down a course and go to an address and call out names and call out diseases and call out sicknesses and tell what you are thinking this past week the Bible tells us that the Word of God is quick and it's discerning the faults are there in the intents of the heart now surely surely we ought to be able to believe that tonight after seeing the son of man manifesting himself time and time and time again but that was not only for brother branham's day that is still alive in the ministry today come on somebody you may play a tape and brother Branham may not call your name but if you're sitting under live ministry tonight I'd say that God if you pull on that gift of God tonight God is so able to take me off of my fault and come to your heart and you can have a moment of the miraculous now Webster gives us the definition of moment in that word moment is derived from the word momentum it signifies to move to rush to drive or fall suddenly which sense gives that of force the sense of an instant of time it is from falling or rushing the it also it means the an indivisible part of time that means it cannot be divided that moment cannot be divided it cannot be cut in two and the Bible tells us in first Corinthians in there first Corinthians 15 and 51 behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment that cannot be divided in a moment that cannot be cannot be tore apart in a moment in a twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed you talking about moments of miraculous there's been moments where we knew that the Son of Man was calling our name but on that resurrection morning in a moment in a twinkling of an eye he cannot be divided it cannot be tore apart in that moment the miraculous will take place and this body shall put only corruption that's the moment that we're living for as believers tonight the Muslim body I'm not looking for 2020 the next president I'm looking in 2019 for the king of kings and the Lord of lords to step forth in a moment may it be this moment may it be next moment whatever it may be let's be looking for the coming of the king a moment is a force it's an impulsive power it is the importance are in influence or effect we all as Christians have been a part of moments of the miraculous I was awoken earlier this week from from my sleep and when I came to myself at 4:15 on Tuesday morning I actually I awoke myself and I was speaking as if I was speaking to a congregation and I heard my voice speaking God is allowing certain things to happen in moments like these in seasons to bring about a healing and a miracle God has allowed certain things to transpire so that you come to this moment of the miraculous there's been certain things that have added up in your life that have brought you to this spot there's been things that have transpired maybe you went down dark roads or maybe you went through it went through dark trials or went through this that or the other but you see those moments were culminating for a breakthrough you know that there's been certain things and had have happened in your life that you simply cannot explain that you would have to say that was the Lord is that right yesterday evening mine brother Matthew had planned to go out to see sister Irene late late later in the evening but we just got in the truck and left and when we got there we pulled right in front of brother Seth that was sitting there having a kidney stone attack what put me there in that moment none other than Jesus Christ you think God doesn't care this is a mighty car this is a God who is the I am the God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob he wants to show up in your life for a moment of the miraculous hallelujah there are certain things that you can't explain there's certain things that you just know that that was a miracle now the Bible tells us in Hebrews 11 now faith is not faith will be but faith is it's a substance it's it's a reality faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen you see even when you don't see a miracle happening your faith is the substance your faith is the evidence that a miracle is taking place or our healing is transpiring in your life your faith tells you even when you don't feel like worshiping him your faith tells you to or submit God is worship is that right are we in a complete agreeance tonight that God is worship he is the object of worship even when you don't feel like worshiping him your faith tells you that there's power in worshipping God even when you don't see the promise your faith says there is a promise even when you don't feel like any like you've didn't any better your faith says you are getting better even when the doctor says the results ain't looking good when he says the cancer may be coming back whether your depression is going to stay there all of your life even when you don't see him working he's working faith is the evidence that the healing and the miracles on the way you remember you recall by the random as he is teaching them teaching us whole faith you'll hear him talk about you hear talk about seeing that white shirt he knows that it's a white shirt even though he don't see it he'll tell you you'll hear him talk about now I've got an old Barlow knife in my pocket here he said now he said I can't feel it I can't smell it I can't see it but I know that it's there he said now if I would have left it on if I would have left it on my dresser back there when I changed my clothes he said faith would put it in my pocket because God is able to do that when you believe him with all of your heart he said now I know that that chokes you but if you truly believe with all of your heart faith in God it'll put it in your pocket there's some times that there's absolutely no physical evidence for you to believe God there ain't a single evidence in the physical or the scientifical realm that we should worship daughter or believe in God but yet standing here is a people that choose to believe that there is a God and what's believing in you can't see God you can't feel God you can't touch God but something tells you that he's here what tells you that he's here it's not because I say he's here it's not because the song leader says he's here it's because his word said he's here in the God's Word is right or it's not I simply to take this I simply choose to take the absolute all the way whew back up Satan Romans 10 to 17 southern faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the Word of God is that right brother Branham you hear brother Branham and said well people say I want to see a vision he said every time you open this book it's a vision to you do you believe that tonight I've heard people say well I heard God talk to me in a long time when's the last time you read your Bible faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the Word of God Paul says in first Corinthians two and four and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom but in demonstration of the Spirit and a power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God in the Dunamis of God that your faith should not rest in my intellects that your faith should not stand in my wisdom but your faith should stand in the power of God so Paul was telling us here that the power of God would attend the display of truth everywhere and would be a demonstration that would be irresistible that the power was not originated by man but the power was originated from glory this word Dunamis in the Greek he meant strength and power and ability it's the power of performing miracles Jesus would teach us in his prayer in Matthew chapter 6 and 13 when he was telling us how to pray he said lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom and the Dunamis and the glory for ever he may for thine is the kingdom and the dynamite that both Satan right out of your breath for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen he is saying that all power in heaven and earth is given unto me but look in Luke chapter 10 in 19 he says behold I give unto you power I give you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you we know that all power is in him tonight and the power to perform miracles in him tonight but he says behold I give unto you power hello we are a people who have seen the mighty works of God we sing the demonstrations of the Holy Ghost and when miracles are performed or something is done it changes the people's hearts and their attitudes towards Christ but yet after all that we've seen after all that we've seen manifested in this day they're still unbelievers there is still a people who try to say that the days of miracles are past and I will agree with those unbelievers there pass through them because the promise was not unto unbelievers the promise was to believers it may be past for some people but as for me in my house I have seen him as a miracle worker you come to tell me that God doesn't do miracles you're too late he come to tell me that God don't heal no more too late he come to tell me that God can't provide from my financial needs you're too late you've come to tell me that God doesn't pour out his spirit no more you're too late you come to tell me they don't save no more too late when I see a mighty God working in this congregation moving in there young people rising an older generation that wants to worship God in spirit and in truth that tells me that a Living God is amongst the people too late Satan they say God don't do those things no more it's those who people excuse me not those pupils it's those people who won't let God into their heart maybe you're setting their skeptic or a critic tonight a disbeliever in this truth it's you or those kinds of people that will not allow God in their heart you here brother random say that if God could ever gain entrance to every heart in this place there not be one free will one amongst us I wonder if there be if there'd be one little bit of unbelief tonight if there would be one bit of unbelief tonight in your heart it's going to stop you from getting to the miraculous tonight one bit of doubt one bit of criticism one bit of skepticism will stop you from getting through the miraculous but your unbelief will never stop God it'll just stop you Alleluia you see you've got to do exactly like Jesus did when he walked into Jerry's his house he had to kick out all the unbelievers and you got to kick out all the unbelief before you can ever get to the miracle before you can ever see a miracle you've got to kick out all the unbelief you see a miracle is something that cannot be figured out by human mind how many is in here is saved tonight look around everybody take your town take a look around you're looking at miracles you believe me I'm quoting to you the message if you've ever saved it's a miracle you can't explain after all the things that you've done wrong and all the mistakes you made why God loves you but yet God loves you it's a paradox but yet it's true God so loved you that he came for you and died for you you're a miracle tonight raise your head confess it from your lips I'm a miracle divine healing and miracles is two different things you see healing is a process of time but a miracle is instantaneous it's spontaneous we don't seek after miracles we don't come here touch asking God for a miracle sometimes we realize that if God don't show up and God don't do a miracle then there's no hope but we don't come asking God for miracles God performs miracles here brother Branham as he's standing there in prayer lines and I'm just laying a foundation and this evening for the weekend he said the Lord is who we don't ask you to do miracles but we're asking you for an encouragement to know that God is gone miracles are not performed by the will of man it's by the will of God every time that you would hear a person or hear to hear somebody called out it's a miracle just like when you read over in the Bible when Jesus is walking and he sees Nathanael coming and he said and Israelite indeed in whom there is no guile and Nathanael said whence knowest thou me rabbi he said before Philip called me I saw you while you were sitting under the tree that was a miracle right there but the random would say now now he said it would he said it wouldn't take he wouldn't be a miracle if I would say to this person sitting here in the wheelchair you can rise up and be healed he said it would just be their faith acclimating ooh what the Lord says they will be taking God's Word and they would do what God's Word said but a miracle is when he searches all the way down when there's nothing and nobody else knows about but you and God then you know it's a miracle why should we ever doubt come on somebody we've got no reason to have excuses we've got no reason to doubt God for he has manifested himself amongst us is that right it's a miracle every time a vision happens and tells people what's wrong with them but it's a healing just like when Isaiah when he walked up there to haircut Adele Hezekiah to make make your life ready you're getting ready to die but Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and he left and he asked God for a little bit more time he said god of not they acted the gay the grave came pressure I need a little bit more time in life to brace you and the Prophet had to turn around and go back up to Isaiah and tell him that you will not die but you will live but yet it took Hezekiah three days to regain his strength again you see that was a healing not a miracle a miracle is an instant it's a moment and when Christ got a hold of your life it was a miracle you know the road that you were walking now you know the path that you were taking it was taking you down a path of destruction it was a miracle when he got ahold of your life you know sometimes there's times in life when you're looking for God and you're looking for God to do a miracle just like a woman with the blood ish she been dealing with this issue for 12 years she went to every physician that she could spend every drop drop of money that she could to make sure to fix this problem but her issues were never fixed people can run the psychiatrist but the psychiatrist and the psychologist will fix your issue you can run from church to church but it won't fix your issue you can run from posture to posture but it will fix her issue most of time the issues with you [Applause] hello-hello but here this woman was dealing with an issue that she battled for a long time how many times how many have been in here that you've dealt with certain things it's been issues in your life and when Jesus came by you didn't care who was around you you didn't care if anybody else wasn't lifting their hands or nobody else was trying to get to Jesus but you were doing your best to get to Jesus you see the woman with the blood issue was pressing she was determining she had a perseverance in her heart to get to Jesus you see she was looking for a miracle but when you look over in the book of John chapter 4 when there's a woman coming down to a whale one day she was walking down with her waterpot but she had no idea who she was getting ready to meet she wasn't even looking for Jesus she wasn't even looking for Jesus but Jesus showed up there was some women in the Bible that were looking for Jesus and Jesus showed up there's some people that were not looking for Jesus but Jesus showed up whether you see him tonight he's here you may not have came expecting to see Jesus you may not even been wanting to see Jesus or had no idea that you see Jesus but when Jesus shows up he turns were passed around and points you to your future he said if you knew who you was talking to you - for me a drink tonight if you knew who was in this building you would come running to him she had no idea that a miracle was on her way she'd been with five men and the one she was living with but here was a miracle worker and with Jesus begin to tell her all of these things she said we're looking for that Messiah and he said the one you're looking for I am he and she dropped her past she dropped what she was digging with what she was digging down in the well for she dropped her past and she ran to her future and she ran into a city and I found this absolutely amazing that she ran into a city sounding of her miracle hello for gospel I house she was sounding off her miracle to a city who had watched her fall in despair who had watched her fall in prostitution she was sounding off her miracle come and see a man is this not the very Messiah was her sound matching her miracle I would say so if I could have a little more up here brother you've been standing in a vision you as Full Gospel Light House has been standing in a vision to be more sincere and as labor day meetings were transpiring whether Tim Pruitt took the pulpit and he started preaching about a Mamba snake and being more sincere for gospel lighthouse walked right into a vision for gospel lighthouse it's time that you start sounding off your victories and sounding off your miracles you've been asking for your sons let out come you're in the moment at the miraculous [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah Christ interrupted her normal it was just another day it was just the same oh well it was just the same old pot but when Jesus came he interrupted her normally I'd say there's some of your lives that need to be interrupted I'd say some there's some of our products that their lives need to be interrupted I'd say there's some of our lost loved ones that their normal needs to be interrupted I don't come too far my prayer life to give up now I've come too far my praise to go down to a lower level place I don't come too far my preaching to walk back matter of fact I'm not going back I'm not God there's nothing to go back to we are only marching forward Christian soldiers marching as to war let's let nothing hold us back if God commanded a blessing let's receive a blessing when Mary that was just a little girl stepped into the vision we see stepped into the vision she had just walked into her moment she was destined to this moment she was destined to bring forth the Messiah that God would use her womb as an incubator and she would bring for the son boo devil she walked into them ahead in that moment she walked right into it it was her moment when there was nobody else standing around it was her moment when there was nobody else to congratulate her it was her moment we know us know when there was no family when there was no where anybody else that could say that they were a virgin and that they had met an angel there was nobody else to prop her up but she was standing there in her moment of the miraculous come on somehow when there is nobody else in your school that said they had the baptism other Holy Ghost you stood there when nobody else wanted to do right you did right it was your moment you were destined to it there may not be nobody else that ever wants to bring forth or praise like you but bring forth for your breeze that may not be somebody else who wants to lift their hands and clap and say it man but lift your hands don't be afraid to sound off your miracles Mary walked right into the moment and the moment was bigger than she could imagine I wonder sometimes if we walk right into those moments and we don't realize the miracle in the miracle are you with me this evening when Jesus was troubled to get on to the other side of a sea because there was somebody that was over there that was needing a breakthrough they were needing a miracle when Jesus where when Satan swore that he would defeat Jesus but yet Jesus stepped forth in faith and put his foot upon the brow of that boy on the bow of that boat and he spoke peace to that storm because there was somebody on the other side of that seashore that deliverance and when Jesus showed up on the other side of that Shore and he walked out there and there came a man by the name of Legion that was bound by thousands of demons this was legions moment the moment that he'd been looking for he'd been trove to the graveyards been bound by chains bound by fear been violent beliefs he'd been tore apart he cut himself he had a good family good children but this moment was the moment that he'd been waiting for all of his life whoa he was more than a man that stood on the other side of that Shore when Jesus stepped off that boat I'd say every devil in Hale started running for cover brother Branham said that those demons would have never went out there if Legion wouldn't have pushed his way to get to Jesus Legion was not his name but this man's name maybe we could say his name was John maybe we could say his name and maybe he was Susie uh-oh or maybe maybe aunt you are out and on faith or Sarah but there was a man that needed to get to Jesus it was in this moment that the miraculous took place you find a man that was once bound by chains that was driven into a graveyard and in the next moment was sitting at Jesus's feet in his right mind completely dressed but yet you got people today that say they're Christians and they're undressing I'd say they have not had a conversation I had a moment of the miraculous with Jesus if you can undress and call yourself a Christian I'd say you never had your moment but I'd say if you did undressing and you had your moment and you started dressing like a Christian you've had your moment [Music] you remember the moment that he came and what nobody can talk to you out of that moment are you with me this evening hey nobody can talk you out of that moment when Jesus came the Bible tells us turn with me to John chapter 3 give me another another microphone I'm tired up here John chapter 3 and verse 1 and there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews the same came to Jesus by night and said unto him rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from God for no man can do these miracles that thou doest except God be with him so here's a secret believer testifying that no man can do these miracles unless God is with him thank you can you hear me okay well praise the Lord I think the mystical sisters wrote a song there would be no wires in heaven but here Jesus turns he turns to Nicodemus and what what it's heard as Nicodemus is here as he's portraying this this this statement to Christ that we know that no man can do these things except God be with him but Jesus is approaching his first doctorate and jesus answered him and said unto Him verily verily I say under the except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God he says here's Nicodemus saying now wait a minute wait a minute I'm telling you I'm bringing to you that we know that God is with you but you're telling me that I need to be born again or how can a man in their true is in his mother's womb the second time but jesus said you must be born from above you can't understand the teachings and the preachings of this message unless you are born again but you don't have to wait till tomorrow to understand you can receive understanding right now the Bible says is there any among you that like wisdom let him ask I believe that if you are truly born again by the baptism of the Holy Ghost that you will get an understanding of this message and who Jesus Christ is and I believe that if you are truly if there's somebody out in denominations there and I believe that God is still calling from those denominations do you believe that tonight that God is still calling and I believe that they if they are here and they are elected of God that they have to come out of those denominations and come to this message they might have a form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost but they don't have the person you see because before you can have the person you've got to have a restoration and this word is a complete restoration of the Word of God you don't have to wait til tomorrow night service or the next service to be healed maybe you're sitting here and you're designed to be healed tonight or design to be saved or designed to be delivered but you can be delivered right now why you while you're sitting here if you're desiring the baptism of the Holy Ghost I believe that while the preaching of the word is going forth that you can receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost for the Bible says in acts 10 and 44 that while Peter yet spoke these words the Holy Ghost fell on them I say that while the preaching of the word is going forth let him fall upon your life and change your thinking and may you have a moment of breakthrough but if you get healed tonight you aren't healed to you weren't healed tonight you were healed 2,000 years ago if you're delivered tonight you weren't delivered tonight you were delivered 2,000 years ago if you get saved and gets salvation you weren't saved just now you weren't saved at the altar 10 years ago you were safe 2,000 years ago when Jesus died for you at Calvary and every redemptive blessing that God has for you Jesus said at the cross it is finished and everything was done and paid for and Jesus came and took you out of the pawnshop God came and bought you God came and purchased you and took you out of the pawnshop and the moment that you accept your healing or your salvation if you're walking down the street wherever you are the moment you accept it that's when you're turned around and if God be with us then where is it all of his miracles 1961 he says how are you ever going to see a miracle until you become morning glory a miracle of God's grace to take an unbelieving doubter and fill him with the Holy Ghost jesus said except a man be born again he can't even see the kingdom of God if you want to see a miracle become one hello let God work on you for he first he's got some overhauling to do some different lenses to put over your eyes because you're blind dead in sin and trespasses spiritually blind double dead that's right God has to give you life put your eyes so that you can see and perform a miracle and make you a miracle and then you can care then you can see the miracle working God that's the first thing so if you want to see them here cool you got to become a miracle before you can see the miracle worker you got to become a miracle you remember when that man came to brother Branham that was a car salesman and he told him that his wife was a Christian but he didn't want nothing to do with it but one day while he was working as a car salesman he had sold a car to two to ladies and he said I begin to wonder he said now did I give that lady both set of keys to her car and he reached down in his pocket and when when he reached down in his pocket he pulled out a tag that had a question mark on it and on the other side it said where will you spend eternity and he threw that thing in the trashcan and he said something said to him that's got to be settled he wouldn't grab it and he read over it again and he threw it in the trashcan and he did it again and he said he got so nervous and it said kept saying to him now that's got to be settled he said there he said my wife he said we went to we went to brother billy graham's he won her brother billy graham's meetings and he said I was hunting after and he said I went there and Billy Graham said is there anybody here that would like to accept Christ as their personal Savior then raise your hand and accept him he said they took him into a room and asked him do you accept Christ as your personal Savior and he said I do he said but it wasn't over yet he said there were felt like there was still something that wasn't settled yet he said so I went down to the Methodists and he said the Methodists told me that you got to get happy and you got to get sanctified and you got a shout before it's all over he said I got happy I say it got sanctified and shouted he said but it felt like something still wasn't over he said then I went down to the Pentecostal group he said I went down there and I asked me have you smoked in tongues yet and he said no I haven't he said then then they told him so well it's not over so he went into a room and the power of God he prayed and the power of God fell on him and he began to speak in tongues but he said I felt like his if it wasn't over he said I went he said I made reconciliation for everything that I've done wrong he said I gave money to preachers I gave I sold cars and gave cars to the evangelists and done all these things made everything right I tried to pay reconciliation and brother Branham told him said that wasn't necessary because you can't pay your way into heaven you can't work your way into heaven grace has already provided a way for you into glory he said but then they told me that I must have crossed over a line and the only one that could help me was you brother Branham he said so I came all the way here to see you brother Branham brother Branham stopped him he said now he said what they told you was the truth but it wasn't all the truth he said you said that something's got to be settled and you couldn't get over that he said now you were going down a road this way and all at once you started back this way you didn't care for God and he started back hunting for him I said rights there is where you made your turn that's exactly what changed you right there and he said then I've had it all the time I said certainly he said oh praise be to God what he'd been hunting for where he thought that he could make a way or pay his way into Calvary he had all that time you've been trying to fix your own problems and trying to figure a way out all this time but when your heart turned for God that's when you got it that's when you made the turn it was in that moment when that little bitty sticker that a little bitty thing where will you spend eternity at that's where he made the turn you remember that moment that you started hunting after God God built you in such a way that you would hunt after him like there's a deep calling to the deep he built you for that moment he built you so that a miracle could take and transpire in your life you've been trying to dig your own way out but gods already made her way out he can say well I'm doing my best to run from God God's already found your hiding place they say hide-and-go-seek with God God's already in your hiding spot he's in your future he's in your mind surely if he's in your future he knows how to get rid of your past you were built for moments like these every person sitting here knows the moment that he turns you you see the Bible the Bible was never written to show us only what God had done in the past but the Bible was written to show us who God is and what he wants to do in every generation in every walk of life everywhere on earth God is wanting to so come and live in your life and take a hold of your life that you'll be a miracle for Christ you're not the only church that believes in miracles you're not the only people that call themselves message believers there's people that call themselves believers but yet they don't believe we preach divine healing because the Bible says so but there's also other denominations that preach divine healing there's people that preach that God is a performer of miracles but yet brother Branham would say that those people would scream out and say well look we've got all of these results we've got these results here we get results but yet the results never take them back to the word where is your results leading you tonight the impact of his holy spirit that led you to this moment where is it leading you are you still coming to church just for your mom or your daddy or are you really coming for God I'd say that if you're truly not coming for him you need to allow the moment to transpire don't waste another moment don't waste another breath may there be such a moment that transpires in your life that you know that he showed up that you know that he showed out it was legions moment it was Mary's moment it was all of the heroes of faith it was their moment but now it's your moment now it's your time somebody's gonna rise up and believe somebody's gonna rise up and say I know that I can I will I do believe would there be somebody in the house of God that said I will be one of those let's stand this evening to be continued in moments like these I see now I see two here in moments [Music] [Music] or singing Oh [Music] Oh ah [Music] to [Music] [Music] [Music] all mary did was act upon what is that's also did is take daughter is and the moment that you act upon god's word that's when the miracle happens when you begin to take a step or a leap of faith that's when America before she ever felt a kid speaking to testify it may not look like it but yet start confess it may not feel like it the you keep [Music] I know it's only one because his word said who you choose to take God at His Word there's sometimes the God test your faith to really see if you believe [Music] but God so wants to give you a testimony [Music] whatever you got to do shake this war may for gospel items have such a testimony that it'll rock the shake songs to cross Jesus sets her desire tonight the Matthews you sing this evening as you're dismissed we want to be a prayer for our pastor this evening as he would be preaching there he Canada pray for the sick and the needy that are amongst us come back in the house of the Lord tomorrow evening expecting a move of God and God bless you as you go this evening [Music] you
