[51:18] book of hebrews
[51:21] chapter 10
[51:24] hebrews chapter 10 verse 5
[51:26] and then down to proverbs chapter 31 and
[51:30] verse 10.
[51:46] hebrews chapter 10.
[51:50] and verse 5.
[51:58] i want to be remembering our pastor
[52:00] brother ron today
[52:02] as he'll be he ministered there last
[52:04] night and the lord would restore his
[52:06] strength we want to pray that the lord
[52:07] would restore his strength to him today
[52:09] and
[52:10] they'll be speaking again later this
[52:12] evening
[52:13] so we just want to be remembering
[52:15] brother ron
[52:16] hebrews chapter 10 and verse 5
[52:19] wherefore when he came when he cometh
[52:22] into the world he saith sacrifice and
[52:25] offering thou what is not
[52:27] but a body
[52:28] thou hast prepared for me
[52:31] proverbs chapter 31 and verse 10.
[52:46] we recognize that most of the proverbs
[52:50] that were written by
[52:51] they were written by king solomon
[52:54] you go read any book in barnes and noble
[52:57] and they'll tell you how to get wisdom
[52:59] and you'll find that they grabbed most
[53:01] of their
[53:02] knowledge straight from the book of
[53:03] proverbs
[53:05] but when you go to studying out proverbs
[53:07] 31
[53:09] you'll find that it's a lady of grace
[53:11] that is writing this
[53:14] you'll find that
[53:15] it's a woman that that understands
[53:18] the power of jesus christ
[53:21] it's bathsheba that is that is speaking
[53:24] these words
[53:26] these are the words as they transition
[53:28] from proverbs 31 and notice
[53:31] notice what solomon is writing here
[53:34] and who can find a virtuous woman
[53:37] for her price
[53:39] is far above rubies may god bless his
[53:41] word he may be seated in the presence of
[53:43] the lord
[53:46] who can find a virtuous woman
[53:49] for her price is far
[53:51] above rubies
[53:52] verse 11 says the heart of her husband
[53:55] thus safely trusting her
[53:58] so that he shall have no need of spoil
[54:01] she will do him
[54:03] good and not evil all the days of her
[54:05] life
[54:06] she seeketh war wool and flax and
[54:08] worketh willingly with her hands
[54:11] she is like the merchant ships she
[54:13] bringeth her food from afar
[54:15] she rises also while it is yet night and
[54:18] giveth meat to her household and a
[54:20] portion to her maidens
[54:22] she considereth a field and buyeth it
[54:25] with the fruit of her hands she planteth
[54:27] a vineyard
[54:29] she girdeth her loins with strength and
[54:32] and strengtheneth her arms
[54:34] she perceiveth that her merchandise is
[54:36] good her candle goeth not out by night
[54:39] she layeth her hounds her hands to the
[54:42] spindle and her hands
[54:43] hold the distaff
[54:46] she stretches out her hand to the poor
[54:48] yay she reaches forth her friend her
[54:50] hands to the needy
[54:52] she is not afraid of the snow for her
[54:54] household for all her household are
[54:56] clothed with scarlet
[54:58] she maketh herself coverings of tapestry
[55:00] her clothing is silk and purple
[55:03] her husband is known in the gates when
[55:05] he sitteth amongst the elders of the
[55:07] land
[55:08] she maketh fine leaneth and selleth it
[55:10] and delivereth girdles upon unto the
[55:13] merchant
[55:14] strength and honor
[55:15] or her clothing
[55:17] and she shall rejoice in time to come
[55:20] she openeth her mouth with wisdom and
[55:23] her tongue is the law of kindness
[55:25] she looketh well to the ways of her
[55:27] husband and it is not the bread of
[55:29] idleness
[55:31] notice this lady is a lady of grace her
[55:34] children arise up and call her blessed
[55:36] her husband also and he praiseth her
[55:39] many daughters have done virtuously but
[55:42] thou excellest them all
[55:44] favor is deceitful
[55:46] and beauty is vain but a woman that
[55:49] feareth the lord
[55:51] shall
[55:52] she shall be praised
[55:56] give her
[55:58] of the fruit of her hands
[56:02] and had her own works praise her
[56:06] in the gates
[56:08] a virtuous woman
[56:10] a virtuous woman
[56:13] for her price is far above rubies i'd
[56:16] like to speak to you today
[56:19] i'd like to speak to you on this thought
[56:23] that vasti
[56:25] can never be an esther
[56:28] and an esther can never be a vasti
[56:32] so i'd like to continue our thought on
[56:34] experiencing the liberty
[56:36] of this message
[56:38] but recognizing who you are
[56:42] you're not just one of the girls
[56:44] you're not just one of the ladies that
[56:46] was setting out on the streets
[56:48] you're his queen
[56:50] and to think that today that one of the
[56:52] greatest treasures in life
[56:54] that god could give to a man
[56:57] is a godly wife
[56:58] i'm going to give you some instruction
[57:00] young brothers
[57:01] one of the greatest things that man that
[57:03] a man can receive in this life outside
[57:06] of the baptism of the holy ghost
[57:08] is a godly wife
[57:10] a woman that is faithful a woman who is
[57:12] loyal a woman that is honorable a woman
[57:16] that is honest and trustworthy a woman's
[57:18] whose love whose love who loves beyond
[57:22] any barriers she loves beyond any faults
[57:25] her love has no distance her love knows
[57:28] no bounds
[57:29] the love that she has towards her
[57:31] husband
[57:32] it is patient love is kind it is it is
[57:36] passionate it is a woman a woman that
[57:39] fears the lord that is that is a godly
[57:41] woman that god gives
[57:43] it that god gives unto man it's the
[57:46] greatest gift that you can ever have is
[57:48] god giving a man a wife that is that is
[57:52] true to him
[57:53] that'll be a real mother to his children
[57:55] a woman that'll have the same words that
[57:57] ruth said when when orpah kissed naomi
[58:01] naomi and went back to the the gods of
[58:03] the moabites here ruth began to speak
[58:06] these words entreat me not that i not
[58:09] leave thee or return from following
[58:11] after thee for wither thou goest i will
[58:14] go and where you lodge i will lodge thy
[58:17] people will be my people and thy god my
[58:19] god where you die i will die there will
[58:22] i be buried you see that's the kind of
[58:25] woman that's the kind of wife that god
[58:28] wants today is a woman that is willing
[58:30] to go wherever he's willing to go where
[58:33] the spirit of the lord leads us it will
[58:35] never be to a place that his grace of
[58:37] god cannot keep us but to think that
[58:40] today that god god wants a woman that
[58:43] has a kind of a love like paul would say
[58:46] in first corinthians 13 that that
[58:48] charioth charity suffereth long and love
[58:51] it is kind it love enveth not charity
[58:54] hath vaunteth not itself it's not puffed
[58:56] up it does not behave itself and
[58:58] seemingly seeketh not our own it is not
[59:02] it's not easily provoked it thinketh no
[59:04] evil it rejoiceth not in iniquity but
[59:07] rejoiceth in truth it beareth all things
[59:10] it believes all things and hopeth in all
[59:13] things and it adores all things notice
[59:16] what what paul said that charity never
[59:19] fails and you you watch the love between
[59:22] a husband and a wife and you you watch
[59:24] as it as it begins to grow throughout
[59:27] throughout the intimate sea of of
[59:29] throughout a courtship and then it moves
[59:30] into and it moves into a deeper
[59:33] relationship and you watch as that love
[59:35] begins to grow it's a love that no man
[59:38] can break it's a love that no man that
[59:40] no man it knows no bounds and you watch
[59:43] as what love will do it will drive me
[59:45] and it will drive me crazy sometimes but
[59:48] it will also drive them to go to the
[59:50] depths of the world to save somebody to
[59:53] to the one that they love it'll make a
[59:55] man from grottos virginia marry a girl
[59:58] all the way in mary in north carolina
[1:00:00] love is a very powerful force and to
[1:00:03] think that that we have and we express
[1:00:06] this this human love but to think about
[1:00:08] the love of almighty god the love that
[1:00:11] that we see and i believe that we have a
[1:00:13] great example that was set before us in
[1:00:16] in brother homer and sister nancy and
[1:00:18] brother ron and sister connie and you
[1:00:20] begin to see the love relationship it's
[1:00:23] not a it's not a relationship of hate
[1:00:25] it's not a relationship of bondage but
[1:00:27] it is a relationship that is that is
[1:00:30] based upon vows of of promises that
[1:00:32] they're not just hoping to keep its vows
[1:00:35] that they're going to keep because they
[1:00:37] vowed this not between one another but
[1:00:39] they vowed that before almighty god and
[1:00:42] to think about the love that we have and
[1:00:44] and you sitting there your brothers and
[1:00:46] brothers and your sisters sitting there
[1:00:48] beside your beside your mate this
[1:00:50] morning you express that love in ways
[1:00:53] that that nobody else can express it
[1:00:55] like like you can express it there's
[1:00:57] there's nobody when when things are
[1:00:59] going wrong and you might be just a
[1:01:01] little bit moody brother roger and
[1:01:03] sister anne just knows how to put her
[1:01:05] arm right right up underneath of you and
[1:01:07] just calm you down and settle your
[1:01:09] nerves it's just something about a wife
[1:01:12] that that that she can calm you down
[1:01:14] when when you when you're all flustered
[1:01:16] and and it's just the way that she has
[1:01:19] when you come in from a hot day's work
[1:01:21] she's got that ice sweet tea and
[1:01:23] watermelon setting over there she just
[1:01:25] knows exactly what you like maybe you
[1:01:27] like fried chicken or maybe you like a
[1:01:30] ribeye steak but she knows what you like
[1:01:32] and she's wanting to please you maybe
[1:01:34] maybe you like waking up on sunday
[1:01:36] mornings and getting biscuits and gravy
[1:01:39] but it's something that she knows how i
[1:01:41] see somebody saying amen right there on
[1:01:43] that one but it's something that she
[1:01:46] knows that you love it's something that
[1:01:48] she's wanting to express it isn't it's
[1:01:51] that wife that is to you brothers she's
[1:01:54] not your doormat
[1:01:56] she's your queen she's the queen of your
[1:01:59] she's the queen of your house she's the
[1:02:01] queen of your heart she's the queen of
[1:02:03] your mind your whole mind and your whole
[1:02:06] your whole doing is to make sure that
[1:02:08] this wife is taken care of and to think
[1:02:11] that today that that christ ever since
[1:02:14] the garden of eden has longed to rebuild
[1:02:16] that holy union between god and man
[1:02:20] between between between that holy union
[1:02:23] that was started there back there in the
[1:02:25] garden of eden when eve which was
[1:02:28] deceived into breaking that union god is
[1:02:31] desiring that type of union before and
[1:02:34] he's desiring it right now but we find
[1:02:36] that throughout the message he said
[1:02:38] you'll find that that she'd been given
[1:02:40] this woman had been given a sacred trust
[1:02:43] that woman was not to break that trust
[1:02:45] of womanhood the act between her and her
[1:02:48] mate that and and to have her character
[1:02:50] and raise her children to be honorable
[1:02:53] to her husband and we recognize that a
[1:02:56] woman always types out the church but
[1:02:59] this this this woman this woman because
[1:03:01] the church is considered a bride notice
[1:03:04] you're not a bride to anybody today but
[1:03:06] you're a bride to the son of jesus
[1:03:09] christ the son of almighty god you see a
[1:03:12] virtuous woman who can find but to think
[1:03:14] that of her price today proverbs 12 and
[1:03:18] 4 said that a virtuous woman is a crown
[1:03:21] to her husband but she maketh her
[1:03:24] but she that maketh ashamed is as
[1:03:27] rottenness as in his bones now there's
[1:03:29] some people that are going to die and go
[1:03:31] to hell but there's some people that
[1:03:33] marry the wrong person and they live
[1:03:36] hell on earth today and i don't believe
[1:03:38] that anybody should have to live on hell
[1:03:40] on earth and i don't believe i believe
[1:03:42] it's something that you ought to it's
[1:03:44] something that you ought to seek out
[1:03:46] earnestly it's not something that we
[1:03:48] that we just venture into on our own but
[1:03:50] you want to find somebody that loves you
[1:03:52] that's got the character of jesus christ
[1:03:54] young boys young girls go listen to the
[1:03:56] marriage of the lamb and go listening to
[1:03:58] the choosing of the bride it'll give you
[1:04:00] a great example of what christ is
[1:04:02] looking for in his church but it also
[1:04:04] give you an example of what you should
[1:04:06] be looking for in a godly wife but you
[1:04:09] watch you watch this woman you see if a
[1:04:12] woman isn't connected with a man in
[1:04:14] trueness then it isn't her husband you
[1:04:17] see if she's just living with him or if
[1:04:19] she's just taking a vow to live with and
[1:04:22] and she's taking that she took a wrong
[1:04:24] vow and she pledged to love him and she
[1:04:26] said that she'd love him and she didn't
[1:04:29] do it you see all the time that man is
[1:04:31] deceived but you see there's one thing
[1:04:34] that we're not going to deceive christ
[1:04:36] because he knows who his wife is he
[1:04:39] knows who she is you see now watch what
[1:04:42] goes on in that relationship as we're
[1:04:44] just building this this morning you
[1:04:46] you're watching that relationship first
[1:04:48] it's a decision and then next it's it's
[1:04:51] the engagement then a promise and then
[1:04:53] there's a ceremony and in that ceremony
[1:04:56] is when the bride takes on the
[1:04:58] bridegroom's name and she goes through
[1:05:01] she goes through all of the she goes
[1:05:03] through all of the elements of the
[1:05:05] relationships and she's carrying these
[1:05:07] things and when the ceremony is over she
[1:05:11] now takes on his name but remember but
[1:05:14] remember she's no longer a church of the
[1:05:16] world but she is the church of the lord
[1:05:19] jesus christ she's not a church by a
[1:05:21] name but she is the bride of jesus
[1:05:23] christ by a birth by a nature by the
[1:05:26] power of god by the revealed truth you
[1:05:29] see when elies are when you go to
[1:05:31] studying over in the book of genesis and
[1:05:33] you see when when abraham was desiring a
[1:05:36] wife for his son isaac that he sent out
[1:05:39] a servant of the of his kingdom and he
[1:05:42] come there and he laid his hand upon his
[1:05:44] thigh and he took an oath that he would
[1:05:46] take a wife out of that out of that land
[1:05:49] there but you watch as eliezer as the
[1:05:52] pressure was getting on him as as it was
[1:05:54] coming die as it was coming due of the
[1:05:57] evening time that eliezer began to pray
[1:06:00] and he began to pray a certain prayer
[1:06:02] that when this woman comes forth to this
[1:06:04] whale that she would do exactly as i
[1:06:06] have said that she'll water us and
[1:06:09] she'll water these camels you see
[1:06:11] eliezer was hunting for abroad and when
[1:06:14] when when rebecca came there what did
[1:06:16] she do she moved right into the
[1:06:19] anointing of the prayer of william
[1:06:22] branham and she moved right in there but
[1:06:24] notice what it was he had found her by
[1:06:27] the witness of the baptism of the holy
[1:06:30] ghost you see he didn't just pick her
[1:06:32] out she was elected by almighty god you
[1:06:35] see god just wasn't up in heaven saying
[1:06:37] any many mighty mole catch a tiger by
[1:06:40] his toe i'll choose this one or i'll
[1:06:42] choose that one god elected you before
[1:06:44] you could ever had a choice before you
[1:06:47] ever could have made a decision you
[1:06:49] didn't have a choice to do with this
[1:06:51] your choice took you down bad roads your
[1:06:53] choice let you down to other lovers but
[1:06:56] this choice his choice chose chosen
[1:06:59] before the foundation of the world and
[1:07:01] rebecca moved under the anointing of the
[1:07:05] message of the hour and she watered the
[1:07:07] camels that would take her back to her
[1:07:09] isaac
[1:07:12] hallelujah she was a woman with
[1:07:15] character
[1:07:16] a woman that would display you
[1:07:19] that when her mother
[1:07:21] and her brother said why why don't you
[1:07:22] just let the bride stay here a little
[1:07:24] bit longer
[1:07:25] when the methodist said no you got to
[1:07:27] stay here with us when the lutheran said
[1:07:29] no you got to stay here with us.
[1:07:32] the servant said let her make her choice
[1:07:35] let her make her choice that's why
[1:07:37] brother branham would preach in 1955 on
[1:07:39] the power of god and the power of satan
[1:07:41] and the power of your decision you see
[1:07:43] you've got the power to choose him today
[1:07:46] you see he already chose you but what's
[1:07:49] your choice you're standing at the altar
[1:07:51] the rings are here the bridal gown is on
[1:07:54] but what is your choice today we already
[1:07:57] know his choice
[1:07:58] we already know his choice he paid the
[1:08:01] ultimate sacrifice for you at calvary
[1:08:07] it's a woman
[1:08:09] with character
[1:08:12] you remember
[1:08:13] you remember the
[1:08:15] chicago boss's son
[1:08:20] the son of the armor and company
[1:08:23] the man that had all
[1:08:25] all the fields
[1:08:27] the man that had all the wealth
[1:08:30] he could have had any maiden in the land
[1:08:33] but this boaz wanted one
[1:08:36] he wanted one that would reflect himself
[1:08:39] this this this rancher's son he they
[1:08:42] they went there and he he had went out
[1:08:44] there who went out a decree that he was
[1:08:46] looking for a wife he was looking for a
[1:08:49] wife and and there see there you know
[1:08:51] the story that she began to they're
[1:08:53] there those girls they begin to dress up
[1:08:56] and they begin to they begin to put on
[1:08:57] all their dress and they begin to look
[1:08:59] the part and how they could please him
[1:09:02] they begin to think about what life
[1:09:03] would be like back in the big city what
[1:09:06] what it would be like so they begin to
[1:09:07] dress up like the girls from the city
[1:09:10] you see god's not wanting a girl that
[1:09:13] looks like the rest of the world he's
[1:09:15] wanting a lady that is dressed according
[1:09:18] to his promises that are laid out in
[1:09:21] deuteronomy that are laid out in first
[1:09:22] corinthians 11 he's wanting a lady
[1:09:25] that's that that has decorated herself
[1:09:27] like esther david decorated herself what
[1:09:30] does the king like you see it's not
[1:09:32] about what i like it's not about what
[1:09:35] the world wants it's not about what the
[1:09:37] church religion of the religiosity of
[1:09:39] the world is preaching or or their ideas
[1:09:42] of what christ is what does he want i
[1:09:45] believe that today that there's a bride
[1:09:47] that has moved into the auspices of the
[1:09:50] holy ghost that is moving right into the
[1:09:53] rhythm of the music of the message of
[1:09:55] the hour and she's being dressed in this
[1:09:58] fine line and she's wrapped herself in
[1:10:00] this body word she's wrapped herself in
[1:10:02] the blood of jesus christ she looks the
[1:10:05] part she's not just looking the part
[1:10:07] she's not just looking the part i'll say
[1:10:10] this she is the part
[1:10:12] she is his wife she is his queen she is
[1:10:15] his everything she's everything that
[1:10:17] he's been waiting for
[1:10:22] hallelujah if he was looking for
[1:10:24] methodists he'd took a rapture in
[1:10:27] luther's day or in wesley's day but it
[1:10:30] wasn't that what he was looking for he
[1:10:32] was looking for a wife that had liberty
[1:10:35] he was looking for a wife that had been
[1:10:37] set free you see there was so many
[1:10:39] chains upon her in luther's day there
[1:10:42] were so many chains upon her in
[1:10:44] methodist day that she couldn't put on
[1:10:46] the full garment but under the
[1:10:48] revelation of the seven seals she's put
[1:10:51] on the wedding garment and brother
[1:10:53] branham said in the marriage of the lamb
[1:10:55] that the bride has the material to dress
[1:10:57] herself with if you don't trust yourself
[1:11:00] it's your own fault you've been given
[1:11:02] the greatest message that's ever
[1:11:04] received in this land
[1:11:06] you can dress yourself under the
[1:11:09] ministry of malachi 4.
[1:11:16] vasti will never be an esther and esther
[1:11:18] would never be a vasty
[1:11:20] [Applause]
[1:11:23] he can have anybody he's a mighty man of
[1:11:27] wealth he can have anybody
[1:11:28] but he wants you
[1:11:31] you think about how great this god is he
[1:11:33] could have anybody who wanted to he
[1:11:35] didn't have to die but he died for you
[1:11:38] he could have he could have had he could
[1:11:40] he could have took it he could have took
[1:11:42] it the way he wanted to but he wanted
[1:11:44] you
[1:11:46] you think you think where the bride was
[1:11:48] in 1977 but you weren't even here most
[1:11:51] of you
[1:11:52] but because god so wanted you
[1:11:54] he designed it that he would give us a
[1:11:57] space where we would repent and turn
[1:11:59] back to him
[1:12:01] so that we could be his wife
[1:12:05] how did she see how did he see her how
[1:12:07] did he see her he didn't see her in some
[1:12:10] great garment he didn't see her he
[1:12:12] didn't see her dressed up with all the
[1:12:14] girls out there in the dance party of
[1:12:16] the world he didn't see her with
[1:12:18] fingernail polish on he didn't see her
[1:12:21] with a with blue eyes and makeup all
[1:12:23] over her face and blush all over her but
[1:12:25] he watched her when he stepped outside
[1:12:29] when he stepped outside of glory he
[1:12:31] watched her as she began to work in the
[1:12:33] field he watched ruth he watched how she
[1:12:36] handled herself
[1:12:39] he watched how this little girl and she
[1:12:41] was moved how that she was she was she
[1:12:44] would look like a little cinderella to
[1:12:46] us and she was out there she was walking
[1:12:48] barefooted she'd come before him humble
[1:12:53] and she was casting out the dish water
[1:12:56] doing the work he recognized that there
[1:12:59] was something about this girl that he
[1:13:01] was longing for he said in about a year
[1:13:04] i'm coming back for you everybody make
[1:13:06] make fun of you everybody might say he's
[1:13:09] not coming back for you you know
[1:13:10] everybody might say it was just a joke
[1:13:13] but god has had a desire
[1:13:16] and god will not lie he's not a man that
[1:13:19] he would lie he's not he's not obligated
[1:13:22] to your feelings but he is obligated
[1:13:24] through his word and he said he never
[1:13:26] leave you and he never forsake you i'll
[1:13:28] be with you even in you to the end of
[1:13:30] the world little lady of grace let me
[1:13:32] say this to you rapture season is at
[1:13:35] hand
[1:13:38] hallelujah god's desire for a wife to
[1:13:42] have queen authority
[1:13:44] to operate like a queen
[1:13:48] if you're in the kingdom
[1:13:50] you carry yourself differently
[1:13:53] if you're in a kingdom you handle
[1:13:54] yourself differently because you got
[1:13:56] kingdom
[1:13:58] authority god's wanting a wife that's
[1:14:01] not like israel that when a whoring
[1:14:03] after other gods he's wanting a wife
[1:14:05] that'll stay true to him
[1:14:07] that'll stay true to him in good times
[1:14:09] that are straight to stay good to him in
[1:14:11] sickness and in health
[1:14:14] he's wanting a wife that when he asks
[1:14:16] for her presents she comes
[1:14:19] when fasting decided no i'm not going
[1:14:21] down to the king's bank
[1:14:25] what did it do when the jews shut down
[1:14:28] the door it opened the door for esther
[1:14:30] let me tell you what they were screaming
[1:14:32] for up there on calvary's hill let his
[1:14:35] blood be upon us they don't recognize
[1:14:38] what they were doing they were opening
[1:14:39] the door for the gentiles
[1:14:43] what did he do he turned the gospel
[1:14:45] towards you and what did it do at people
[1:14:48] that were without god and people that
[1:14:50] were not even considered in the picture
[1:14:52] it turned god's liberty loose on the
[1:14:54] church of the living god
[1:15:01] he said we know that the modern church
[1:15:04] in its present condition
[1:15:06] and its presence states in no condition
[1:15:07] to finish up the great commission that
[1:15:09] god gave the church for this day
[1:15:11] he would say on the invisible union he
[1:15:13] said we know that the church could not
[1:15:15] the pentecostal church by no means could
[1:15:17] carry out the last day's message in its
[1:15:19] present condition he said why i can't
[1:15:21] even agree with one word one word in the
[1:15:23] bible
[1:15:24] he said but it's going to be an elected
[1:15:26] people that is elected for it
[1:15:28] do you recognize how powerful that you
[1:15:30] are that you are elected to carry this
[1:15:32] message out do you recognize what
[1:15:35] rebecca was receiving when she was down
[1:15:37] there and it took her all day long and
[1:15:39] eight hour day work watering those
[1:15:42] camels what was she doing she was
[1:15:45] watering the power that would take her
[1:15:47] back to her isaac and what it is when
[1:15:49] you begin to worship under the presence
[1:15:51] of almighty god there goes out of
[1:15:53] hallelujah there goes out in amen there
[1:15:56] goes out of glory hallelujah and it
[1:15:59] comes out what are you doing you are
[1:16:01] watering the power of the holy ghost
[1:16:03] that'll take you in the rapture it'll
[1:16:05] take you to your eyes that'll meet you
[1:16:07] in the sky there's no way that he can
[1:16:10] leave you esther ruth i want you to know
[1:16:12] your boaz will not leave you but he's
[1:16:14] going out and make a public testimony

[1:16:19] worthy enough to take her i'm big enough
[1:16:22] to handle her i'm big enough i'm strong
[1:16:24] enough i've got enough wealth oh but you
[1:16:27] don't know the scars that's on her life

[1:16:33] at she was a moabitess it doesn't matter
[1:16:36] what i'm getting ready to pour out it's
[1:16:38] enough to watch all the moabite off of

[1:16:46] am going to play out the part of my
[1:16:48] gentile wife
[1:16:54] just like caleb and joshua were elected
[1:16:56] to go in there
[1:16:58] and they were elected to possess and
[1:17:00] fulfill the promise that was given to
[1:17:02] abraham so was this bride elected to
[1:17:04] carry out this message brother branham
[1:17:07] said may i add to this woman grace
[1:17:11] hallelujah
[1:17:14] may i place her in the bible also called
[1:17:16] the elect lady he said like be a virgin
[1:17:19] like the virgin was to bring forth the
[1:17:21] body of god on the earth she was an
[1:17:23] elected woman god chose mary he said and
[1:17:26] also god has chosen elected lady which
[1:17:29] is his bride she's elected
[1:17:33] they can make fun of you all they want
[1:17:34] to they can say they can say that he's
[1:17:37] not coming back for you but i want you
[1:17:39] to know that the prophet said that
[1:17:41] before the foundation of the world he
[1:17:43] slipped on your fingers the unworthy
[1:17:45] unmerited wedding brand of almighty
[1:17:48] grace he slipped on your fingers the
[1:17:51] unmerited band of grace upon you before
[1:17:54] you could ever get in trouble before you
[1:17:56] got in your circumstances before you had
[1:17:58] a wrecked of life before you let your
[1:18:01] children go before you made bad
[1:18:03] decisions he slipped it on you
[1:18:07] he elected you to this kingdom
[1:18:10] i'll tell you what he elected to you
[1:18:12] this kingdom and there ain't no power in
[1:18:14] hell that can keep you from this kingdom
[1:18:17] there ain't one sickness that'll keep
[1:18:18] you from it there ain't one disease
[1:18:20] there ain't one demon there ain't one
[1:18:22] tormented spirit that'll keep you from
[1:18:24] this kingdom if god has elected it for
[1:18:26] you it's for you
[1:18:28] let me tell you he knows exactly what
[1:18:30] you want queen of heaven
[1:18:34] he's got walls of jasper he's got gates
[1:18:36] of pearl he's got streets of gold he's
[1:18:38] got a river that's running from it and
[1:18:40] there's and as matthew spoke last night
[1:18:43] he is the light of that city
[1:18:47] he knows
[1:18:49] what you want
[1:18:50] when you don't even know what you
[1:18:52] want said but you watch
[1:18:59] he said when you see women go on a
[1:19:00] rampage and just doing anything that
[1:19:03] they want to do
[1:19:04] he said do you watch the church she's
[1:19:06] doing the same thing
[1:19:10] you want to watch where the church is
[1:19:12] you watch where women are at
[1:19:14] if you want to watch where the bride is
[1:19:15] watch where israel's at
[1:19:17] but you watch
[1:19:18] women are on a rampage they're doing
[1:19:20] anything they want to if there is a
[1:19:22] liberation of anything brother random
[1:19:23] said it is a liberation of women's
[1:19:25] rights in this day
[1:19:28] don't get mad at me i'm quoting your
[1:19:29] prophet
[1:19:30] but you watch you watch women are on a
[1:19:32] rampage and are doing anything they want
[1:19:33] to say this is my body but i happen to
[1:19:35] believe that this is his body
[1:19:37] and i you can do you can do what you
[1:19:40] want to outlay ought to see with your
[1:19:41] body but with god's body i'm going i'm
[1:19:44] going to treat it like it's a temple of
[1:19:45] god i'm going to handle it like it's a
[1:19:47] house it's the house of almighty god i'm
[1:19:49] going to dress it like it's a house of
[1:19:51] god i'm going to treat it like it's a
[1:19:52] house of god i ain't going to put no
[1:19:54] holes in it because if we start putting
[1:19:56] holes in the body what have we got we've
[1:19:58] got a watered down gospel and we're
[1:20:00] trying to put our ideas to it and you
[1:20:02] watch what you're doing you're trying to
[1:20:04] get a gospel full of holes instead of
[1:20:06] the full gospel when you start putting
[1:20:08] holes in the body when you start
[1:20:10] painting up the barn and trying to make
[1:20:11] it look better than it was god wants his
[1:20:13] church the way he started it and god
[1:20:15] will have his church the way he'll
[1:20:16] finish it the way he started it and if
[1:20:18] he started it like that in pentecost
[1:20:20] it's going to have to end that way right
[1:20:22] now and there is a body on earth today
[1:20:24] that has dressed herself in the robes of
[1:20:27] his righteousness
[1:20:29] yeah the church is doing what they want
[1:20:30] to and the women's doing what they want
[1:20:32] to but you watch this last day bride
[1:20:35] she's stressing herself in his
[1:20:38] righteousness and there is a message
[1:20:40] that is sweeped out that is going to
[1:20:42] catch this bride
[1:20:45] hallelujah the message got through and
[1:20:48] we're still here
[1:20:50] [Applause]
[1:20:55] hallelujah we know what power we're
[1:20:57] under
[1:20:58] we understand the influence that we're
[1:21:00] under
[1:21:02] jesus told us
[1:21:03] he told us what the holy ghost would be
[1:21:05] it would be three things to us it would
[1:21:07] be a god it would be a comforter and it
[1:21:10] would be the spirit of truth and we know
[1:21:12] exactly where the holy ghost has led us
[1:21:14] to it has led us to this seventh star
[1:21:18] and i'm so thankful that god seemed fit
[1:21:20] to release the character of william
[1:21:22] branham in this day a man that we can
[1:21:24] relate to a man that a man that a man
[1:21:27] that didn't lie to us
[1:21:29] a man that was true a man that was a
[1:21:31] rugged man a man of faith a man that
[1:21:33] admitted that he was a man that he
[1:21:35] admitted that he was a man
[1:21:37] i can have confidence in a man that
[1:21:39] proves that he's a man and he said he
[1:21:42] said i'm not preaching to you myself i'm
[1:21:43] preaching to you jesus christ this
[1:21:46] seventh star had characteristics that
[1:21:48] would pull out abroad of this last day
[1:21:50] and because of the light in this day
[1:21:52] there's a bride that's standing on earth
[1:21:54] today she's not sitting down she's not
[1:21:57] sitting over in a corner this bride is
[1:21:59] standing to her feet
[1:22:03] watch what he did he drawed you to
[1:22:05] himself
[1:22:06] you remember
[1:22:07] you remember in 1933 when brother
[1:22:09] branham was baptizing at this
[1:22:11] at the foot of spring street right there
[1:22:13] on the ohio river and he's there
[1:22:15] baptizing and i believe the newspaper
[1:22:18] said it was five thousand people that we
[1:22:20] had lined that i had lined that
[1:22:22] riverbank and they were there watching
[1:22:23] and the newspaper
[1:22:25] actually carried it up there in canada
[1:22:27] that a mystic light shined over top of a
[1:22:29] local minister while he was baptizing
[1:22:32] out there on the ohio river and you
[1:22:34] remember as matthew went through the
[1:22:35] event last night you remember that that
[1:22:37] as that as that star began to come down
[1:22:40] that mystic star began to come over the
[1:22:42] man that was out there baptizing his
[1:22:44] 17th person as he was baptizing out
[1:22:46] there in the ohio river that that the
[1:22:48] water began to turn around
[1:22:50] around william branham and he said as
[1:22:52] he's getting ready to baptize there was
[1:22:54] a voice that came out it said as john
[1:22:57] the baptist forerunned the first comet
[1:22:58] of christ so will your message william
[1:23:00] branham forerun the second coming of
[1:23:03] christ
[1:23:04] now sister mita sister media said that
[1:23:07] when when that happened it was actually
[1:23:09] brother branham's voice that spoke out
[1:23:11] right there i and it doesn't matter to
[1:23:13] me whose voice it was i recognized that
[1:23:16] this was that i it doesn't matter to me
[1:23:18] if it was william brannon's voice
[1:23:19] because i recognize that that is
[1:23:21] revelations 10 7. i reckon i recognize
[1:23:24] that that is malachi 4. it is his voice
[1:23:26] it is his voice that god called in this
[1:23:28] day but i didn't hear just william
[1:23:30] branham's voice i heard god's voice you
[1:23:33] see that's the problem with so many
[1:23:34] people today that get their eyes on the
[1:23:36] man i didn't fall in love with eliezer i
[1:23:39] am rebecca i am falling in love with my
[1:23:42] isaac yes i appreciate eliza yes i thank
[1:23:46] him for bringing the camels to me yes i
[1:23:48] thank him for going to my going to my
[1:23:50] mothers and my brothers but i am not
[1:23:52] marrying eliessa i am marrying my isaac
[1:23:56] and as rebecca met her isaac out in the
[1:23:59] field so will this bride meet her bride
[1:24:02] quilt in the middle of the air
[1:24:05] [Applause]
[1:24:15] brother branham said
[1:24:16] people said that was psychology that
[1:24:18] come down there
[1:24:21] he said but he come down and he shut the
[1:24:23] mouths of the unbelievers
[1:24:25] because he stayed with the word
[1:24:28] to think that that pillar of fire
[1:24:30] brother adam would go to talking about
[1:24:32] that pillar of fire and he began to
[1:24:33] speak about it said people thought that
[1:24:35] was psychology and people people
[1:24:36] disbelieved that he said but he stopped
[1:24:38] their mouths and he began to talk about
[1:24:40] that that's the same pillar of fire that
[1:24:42] led the children of israel he said
[1:24:44] matter of fact here he comes now
[1:24:47] now i know i know many of you many of
[1:24:49] you have sat here and you've seen the
[1:24:51] pillar there were some of you that seen
[1:24:52] it at brother steve thomas's funeral
[1:24:54] there are some of you that seen it even
[1:24:56] in the past few weeks and there's some
[1:24:58] of you that seen it in years gone by but
[1:25:00] to me
[1:25:01] but to me whether you see it or whether
[1:25:02] you don't to look at that pillar fire
[1:25:04] that's hanging over william branham
[1:25:05] brother branham said he said it's a
[1:25:07] greater vindication to recognize that
[1:25:08] that's the pillar of fire than to see it
[1:25:10] with your own eyes because your eyes can
[1:25:12] play tricks on you so don't go don't
[1:25:13] don't get i'm just going to speak to you
[1:25:15] in a natural just for a moment don't you
[1:25:16] get disheartened because you've never
[1:25:18] seen something in the natural or maybe
[1:25:19] maybe you didn't see but if you can
[1:25:20] recognize if you can recognize that
[1:25:22] that's the same pillar of fire that led
[1:25:24] the children of israel it's just as much
[1:25:26] grace to you as somebody that has seen
[1:25:29] it do you recognize do you recognize
[1:25:31] what liberty that has been brought to us
[1:25:33] by the message of the hour that we're
[1:25:35] not sitting here wondering who we are
[1:25:38] we're not sitting here wondering do we
[1:25:40] have the holy ghost or do we not have
[1:25:41] the holy ghost i'm so thankful for this
[1:25:43] message if it wouldn't have been for
[1:25:44] this message there have been a lot of
[1:25:46] people that would have disqualified
[1:25:48] everybody sitting here that have been a
[1:25:50] whole lot of people that have said here
[1:25:52] and never spoke in tongues one time that
[1:25:54] would have been disqualified from the
[1:25:55] pentecostal movement but brother branham
[1:25:57] said he said that is not the initial
[1:26:00] evidence of the baptism of the holy
[1:26:01] ghost he said what the initial evidence
[1:26:04] of the holy ghost is is to be able to
[1:26:06] say amen to every single word of god i'd
[1:26:08] rather you say amen to every single word
[1:26:11] of god than all of you speaking in
[1:26:12] tongues at one time i'd rather you be
[1:26:14] able to have charity i'd rather you have
[1:26:17] love have the love towards almighty god
[1:26:19] but love this message i appreciate your
[1:26:22] hand claps i appreciate your praises but
[1:26:25] when you can say amen to the word of god
[1:26:27] it means that you're saying so be it
[1:26:29] lord jesus i appreciate your shouts i
[1:26:32] appreciate you hallelujahs but when
[1:26:34] you're identifying yourself that you
[1:26:36] believe all of this message to be the
[1:26:39] truth you're putting yourself in the
[1:26:41] same boat with jesus
[1:26:42] [Applause]
[1:26:46] now that ought to liberate you it ought
[1:26:48] to set you free because some of you've
[1:26:50] been sitting there under a devil that's
[1:26:51] told you well you ain't never spoke in
[1:26:53] tongues and you ever never did see the
[1:26:55] supernatural i just liberated you by a
[1:26:58] prophet's message you have been set free
[1:27:06] you recognize that's what men was
[1:27:07] wanting to do they were wanting to clamp
[1:27:09] down the holy spirit and say this it's
[1:27:11] only for our group
[1:27:16] i know some of you are some of you were
[1:27:18] with uh
[1:27:19] with individuals
[1:27:21] and they began to ask you
[1:27:23] you believe in speaking in tongues
[1:27:25] so yeah
[1:27:26] yeah when the anointing gets on us
[1:27:28] yeah when the spirit of the lord wants
[1:27:30] to move on through us and work through
[1:27:31] us
[1:27:33] you see you see to the pentecostal group
[1:27:36] they they
[1:27:37] they teach that you ain't even got the
[1:27:38] holy ghost unless you speak in tongues
[1:27:40] they'll give you a book and i'll set you
[1:27:42] over in a corner and give you a class on
[1:27:45] how to just jammer and stammer and just
[1:27:48] just put a few clicks and claps together
[1:27:50] and all of us now you've got the holy
[1:27:52] ghost well let me tell you this if just
[1:27:54] clicking and clacking gives you the holy
[1:27:56] ghost then every duck out there in the
[1:27:57] pond's got it
[1:27:59] but we ain't a bunch of people that's
[1:28:01] clicking and clacking we know exactly
[1:28:03] who we are we know that we've been
[1:28:04] redeemed we know that we're sitting
[1:28:06] under a prophet's message we're not just
[1:28:08] sitting here wondering who we are do we
[1:28:11] have it or do we not have you received
[1:28:13] the message have you received the person
[1:28:15] of jesus christ it's not about a tape
[1:28:18] you've heard me say it a hundred times
[1:28:20] but young girls it ain't just about
[1:28:22] having a picture it ain't just about
[1:28:24] just being able to recognize william
[1:28:26] branham as a prophet but it's being able
[1:28:28] to be identified with the same pillar
[1:28:30] fire
[1:28:31] that you've met him face to face life to
[1:28:33] life
[1:28:37] well brother random is preaching brother
[1:28:39] adam's preaching that he starts talking
[1:28:41] about that star that come down over the
[1:28:43] ohio river and he starts talking about
[1:28:45] he said matter of fact here he comes now
[1:28:48] he said look
[1:28:49] he said god never parts from his
[1:28:51] commission
[1:28:53] god never parts from his commission
[1:28:56] and i was
[1:28:57] me and me and sister katie we were
[1:28:59] riding back from a meeting
[1:29:00] uh a while back we were riding back from
[1:29:02] a meeting and we were coming across the
[1:29:04] ohio river we were just kind of going
[1:29:06] over these things we're we're
[1:29:08] illustrating it and rehearsing what had
[1:29:10] happened down there in 1933 what
[1:29:13] happened down there at that river we
[1:29:14] began to speak about that
[1:29:16] and katie spoke up and said these words
[1:29:18] and said to think that here you are
[1:29:20] carrying on his commission and preaching
[1:29:23] this message
[1:29:24] and when she spoke those words there was
[1:29:26] a being that that dropped into the car
[1:29:30] he dropped into the car because it
[1:29:32] identified that we are carrying on this
[1:29:35] last day's message when the pentecostals
[1:29:38] wouldn't carry it on there's a people
[1:29:39] that's elected to carry it on
[1:29:42] and i want you to know that being set
[1:29:44] there we fellowship with that being we
[1:29:46] recognize who it was and i'll tell you
[1:29:48] how upset the devil got because of a
[1:29:50] being got in the room i come to as close
[1:29:53] as being in a wreck and killing somebody
[1:29:55] that i've ever come in my life there was
[1:29:56] a man that was working out in the street
[1:29:58] a highway worker and he didn't even have
[1:30:00] a clue i was behind him had headphones
[1:30:02] on he was standing out in the middle of
[1:30:04] the road and i was able to get the
[1:30:05] vehicle stopped feet away from running
[1:30:07] over top of that man if it would not
[1:30:09] have been for that for that being being
[1:30:12] in that car i'd have been a murderer
[1:30:14] today but because
[1:30:17] but because there was an angel that
[1:30:19] stepped into a car he kept you
[1:30:21] let me preach to you on yourself right
[1:30:23] here because there was a being that
[1:30:25] guarded you that guided you and kept you
[1:30:28] it led you to this truth it led you to
[1:30:30] this message it kept you from being a
[1:30:32] murderer it kept you from being a drug
[1:30:34] addict it kept you from being alcoholic
[1:30:37] it kept it from the world and it made
[1:30:39] you a lady of grace
[1:30:44] yes i believe that angel's still here
[1:30:55] i'll tell you what
[1:30:59] i
[1:31:00] moved i moved like never before
[1:31:06] we're in the greatest season that we've
[1:31:07] ever been in
[1:31:08] we're in the greatest hour that we've
[1:31:10] ever been in we're in the greatest
[1:31:12] closing hours of the ministry that we've
[1:31:15] ever been in and to think where we are
[1:31:17] as a body of jesus christ it moves me it
[1:31:20] hits me in my gut it it moves me so if
[1:31:22] i'm going to do anything
[1:31:24] if we've only got a few moments of time
[1:31:26] i'm going to do what i was called to do
[1:31:28] i'm not going to do what men say that i
[1:31:30] should do i'm going to do what god said
[1:31:32] for me to do and i'm going to preach
[1:31:34] this message i'm going to preach it
[1:31:35] harder i'm going to preach it harder i'm
[1:31:37] going to preach it straight i'm going to
[1:31:39] preach it because god has commissioned
[1:31:41] us to preach this message and get
[1:31:44] himself a wife a wife that has made
[1:31:46] herself ready
[1:31:50] so let's live this message if there's
[1:31:52] anything worth living for it's this
[1:31:54] message if there's anything worth dying
[1:31:57] for it's this message it's none other
[1:31:59] than jesus christ if we expect our young
[1:32:01] girls to be filled with the holy ghost
[1:32:03] let's preach the message if we expect
[1:32:06] our young boys to stay away from
[1:32:08] homosexuality let's preach the message
[1:32:10] if we expect our young girls not get
[1:32:12] impregnated by some rotten scoundrel
[1:32:15] let's preach the message
[1:32:18] so excuse me i'm just preaching what
[1:32:20] william branham preached and i believe
[1:32:22] if i preach what william branham
[1:32:24] preached it'll provide jesus christ the
[1:32:27] messenger a lady of grace
[1:32:29] [Applause]

[1:34:26] the lord what stood out to you the most
[1:34:30] he said what stood out to me the most
[1:34:33] is when brother eddie
[1:34:36] would have come to his hour of work
[1:34:38] when it come to his time for his lunch
[1:34:40] break
[1:34:41] he didn't take it like other men took it
[1:34:46] he set out a chair for himself
[1:34:48] and he set out a chair for the lord
[1:34:52] and he said he would just
[1:34:55] bump knees
[1:34:57] just want to converse and fellowship
[1:34:58] with him

[1:35:42] feet you just you know long as soon as
[1:35:44] we dismiss today you'll start talking
[1:35:47] about next week

[1:36:01] wanting to give to you children i know
[1:36:03] what it's like for us to long to be in
[1:36:04] his presence but can you imagine the
[1:36:07] anticipation of almighty god i've waited
[1:36:11] for 2000 years they barred me at the
[1:36:13] doors of creeds and dogmas they barred
[1:36:16] me at their they wouldn't let me in but
[1:36:19] brother brandon i'm setting the feast of
[1:36:20] the trumpets he said she's going to be
[1:36:22] liberated
[1:36:24] there's finally a church that has put on
[1:36:27] the full garment
[1:36:32] i've waited
[1:36:34] he failed me
[1:36:38] the ecclesiastical moves they failed me
[1:36:41] the church world they failed me but
[1:36:43] brother burnham said in christ the
[1:36:45] mystery of god revealed that this bride
[1:36:48] is predestinated not to fail him she
[1:36:51] will have queen authority she'll be born
[1:36:54] of his bone life of his life power of
[1:36:56] his power anointing of his anointing
[1:37:02] now you're aware
[1:37:05] you're already aware that he's here
[1:37:12] let me just express this just a little
[1:37:14] bit deeper
[1:37:21] because you are who you are
[1:37:25] i have come to you
[1:37:27] because you are who you are
[1:37:29] esther
[1:37:30] you will never be a vastly
[1:37:33] you will never
[1:37:34] you will never refuse my presence you
[1:37:37] will never push me away you'll never say
[1:37:39] you'll not come to my banquet but
[1:37:42] because i summoned you you have came
[1:37:45] you have came i have longed for you as
[1:37:49] the song of solomon said i have found
[1:37:51] the one that my soul has longed for
[1:37:55] oh she is my dog she is my everything oh
[1:37:59] she is great she is decked in splendor
[1:38:05] i tried dressing her through the 2000
[1:38:07] years and she'd come as close as she
[1:38:10] would ever be
[1:38:11] in acts
[1:38:17] that's why i caused a preview in this
[1:38:19] day
[1:38:22] i caused a preview in this day
[1:38:26] there she came forth
[1:38:28] her garments
[1:38:29] were spotless
[1:38:31] but i watched the church of every age
[1:38:33] and then i watched the church of america
[1:38:39] and william branham said oh god
[1:38:42] after all this circling the years of
[1:38:45] this circling these worlds is that the
[1:38:48] best that i can offer you
[1:38:55] there was a voice
[1:38:57] said the bride will come and preview
[1:39:00] again
[1:39:01] she'll be just like she was back there
[1:39:04] at the book of acts to think about today
[1:39:07] that god has waited for an hour of
[1:39:09] restoration that god has always had a
[1:39:12] people that he would represent him here
[1:39:14] on earth and thank god that the book of
[1:39:17] job has come to pass that i will restore
[1:39:20] all the years that the cankerworm and
[1:39:22] the caterpillar and the palmer worm they
[1:39:24] ate off of her the catholic system tried
[1:39:27] to eat away the grace of god the powers
[1:39:29] of satan tried to eat away the power of
[1:39:31] god but there was a message of
[1:39:33] restoration
[1:39:35] and god
[1:39:39] i know some of you ain't ready for it
[1:39:41] but i'm telling you to get ready because
[1:39:43] god has anticipated this hour god has
[1:39:46] anticipated resurrection mourning and
[1:39:49] it's just around the corner when the
[1:39:51] prophet said that it was between the
[1:39:53] hours of six and nine he would tell us
[1:39:55] that it's coming by our way i'm telling
