got your trust in man you got something to be ashamed of if you got your trust in the stock market you got something to be embarrassed about if you got your trust in the presidents or the governors or the politics of the day you got something to be ashamed about but if you got your trust in Almighty God you got nothing to be Shaymin about and the people of God say let us never be ashamed of him he was not ashamed of me and I will not be ashamed of him we could go over in the Book of Ruth and we could read there throughout the whole entirety of that Bible there that that scripture reading we would read of a of a woman that by the name of Ruth that would be a type of the bride of Jesus Christ coming out of the country of Moab she was a more by 'test that that she was coming out of a country that was of pagan worship and when with her when her husband had died and her brother-in-law had died and her father and her father had died her husband and brother-in-law all of them had died and Naomi was going back she was going back to her her homeland and and she was taking her two daughters back with her and and they were making a travel out and she turned around to them and said no don't follow me here I'm too old to have a son that you could that you could take on to be your own that would be your husband go back to the land where you came from and Orpah turned kissed her and and went back to the land of Moab but Ruth said to Naomi she said ah where you go I will go your God will be my god your people will be my people and she made this journey and as she's making this journey out of Moab into the land of Judah and Israel where where she was going to a place in which it was a case that were looking possible for Ruth to be accepted in the community of the Israelites it looked like it would be a case where it would be impossible for her to fit in in the crowd of the message people are you with me tonight it would look like a case that that could not be fetched because there was so much debt that was stacked up against Naomi and Ruth it was a case that was impossible that everybody was looking upon this case of Ruth and they al me they were looking at a case in the Naturals hips but they didn't realize that there was a type of Christ that standing there in that country little did the community know that there was a kinsman in that hopper in that moment and waiting for an opportunity when he would step up and redeem Naomi's estate and when Boaz seen Ruth in that condition in a condition of embarrassment in a condition I the condition of sameness and sorrow OS fell in love with Ruth he fell in love with Ruth and he told his man servants that were out in the field now you lay handfuls of purpose for her that she may gather and he went to Ruth and he told her you stay in this field you stay right here don't you go and glean and nobody else's feel don't go over here to the denomination's you stay right here in this field for in this field is a place there's enough here that will feed you there's enough here that will sustain you that's enough here that I'll take care of you there's enough here that I give your body change there's enough here that a rapture your soul there's enough here to wipe away your sin you stay in this field Ruth you stay right here and you go over in the Book of Ruth chapter three and you see when Naomi is given instruction to Ruth to go down when they are winnowing out the wheat and you found when Boaz is down there and he's throughout the threshing floor and they come down to this moment and out that night she went down to when he was winnowing the wheat that night at the garner at the barn Boaz laid down and when he laid down Ruth notice it's not a shame to dispose herself to this man you see Naomi had told her to mark the place where he laid down consider this place mark it out that this is a place that he lays down but Ruth was not ashamed to destroy her her character to be identified with poets she was not ashamed to dispose herself to this man a real true born-again truck tonight is not ashamed to dispose herself to the Holy Ghost call of God is that right went right down into the barn with this man giving him trust every man that comes to Christ must forsake everything on both sides and must put his full faith in the Lord Jesus Christ no matter what your mother says no matter what your daddy says what this one says or what mama says or what anybody else says you trust Christ you trust Christ and don't you be ashamed of it don't you be afraid you trust Christ she walked in and when she found out that she give that trust he throwed his robe around her and the Holy Ghost course to cover with his own roll he said now you go on you argue you go on when daylight comes I've got to do the work of a kinsman before I can receive you can I say it to you like this that are the only stir morning when the Esso in began to harass me and you was identified with him when he rose up from the grief when everybody felt that there was no way that he'd come up here he came and you and I came with him I was in him when he was hanging on the cross if you believe that you're the body of Jesus Christ tonight and I asked for class participation if you believe that you are the body of Jesus Christ you better believe that you was in him when he was hanging on that cross you better believe that you was in him when he went to a devil's Heil you better believe that you were in him when he when he was laying there in a tomb and if you believe that you can believe that you are in him when he rose up early on Sunday morning hallelujah I tell you church this Sun is up you see the kinsman was not ashamed to do the work of a kinsman here OS was not ashamed to do the work for Ruth he was willing he was willing to make a public testimony when he went down there they had an order in which they would do things and when he went there before the elders when they walked in he said I've got something to say to you I am here to redeem Naomi's estate but there was a nearer kinsman than Boaz that was Satan standing there but Satan could not touch you Satan ain't got a right to lay his hands on God's property you see this Redeemer had to be financially able financially able to pay for this estate whoa hallelu he had to be financially able to pay for this state and Boaz was financially able to pay for Naomi and pay for Ruth's estate you see when Christ paid for you he paid when he paid for the Jewish community he paid for you and I whoo hallelujah he had to be financially able how about our God tonight is was he financially able when he said God that owns the cattle on a Thousand Hills he's a God that owns the universe he's a God that owns the spaces in time and everything else in the world I'd say that he was financially able I want you to consider your worth right now consider your worth that the God that owns everything was willing to lay it all down for you let the devil tell you that you ain't worth that's worthless let him tell you that God says different God thoughts so much of you that he condescended down and took on the robe of humanity but when he took on that robe of humanity you see Boaz when he went down there and made a public testimony he took he took off his shoe and he kicked his shoe showing that he was to do the work and Christ click click EEE cut off and he NE kicked off the robes of his righteousness and took on humanity for you and me he thought you was worth the pain he thought of going through the agony was worth it for you now another thing that a shame means that another thing that being ashamed us it shows you that you're not sure what you're talking about if you know what you're talking about and have the assurance that you know what you're talking about you can tell anybody can I get a witness here tonight come on somebody can I get a witness here tonight you see if you if you're ashamed it shows you don't know what you're talking about but if you are not a saint if you're not a saying that shows you know what you're talking about can I get a witness tonight that you have the assurance that you know what you're talking about and you can tell anybody Konoe somebody ll preach right down on your address tonight if you're too good to tell your boss about it if you're too is saying to tell you coworker about it you're a same thing but if you know in whom you have believed and you are persuaded that he's able to take care of you you will not be ashamed to testify of the power of a Living God there's a boy that's not ashamed he got up and singing tonight it feels like fire set up in my bones let me tell you you set somebody afire they'll run all over the building they'll run all over the place when you set somebody a fire there's a fire started here that we're not capable of putting out tonight there's not a that's not enough there's not enough fire how are they calling face hydrants to put them out here there's not enough what blankets here to put them out there's not enough water in our whale to put this fire out that fire that's burning on the inside of this church is a holy fire you see when a man meets God he's not ashamed about he's not unsure about it because he was the one that met God sister Julia you're not ashamed to testify of what God did for you because you're sure that he did it brother Jeremy when you first come here and nobody would have thought that you would have been a pillar for gospel lighthouse but God was not ashamed of you God seen you before the world began that you would be in this church and be a pillar at this church he knew that you would not be ashamed he knew that you would stand behind this gospel with all of your heart and brother Jeremy is not ashamed to testify about it he's not ashamed to tell his mom about it he's not ashamed to tell his family about it he's not ashamed I wonder is there anybody else in the building that's not a saying to testify of the grace of Almighty God hallelujah that means you met God that means histroy that means ain't embarrassed about it we got some witnesses here tonight that God still saves that God still feels that God still delivers hallelujah give Him praise hallelujah we know who we are and we know we're in whom we have believed which sister Katie was walking down the aisle or July the 20th of 2007 but she was walking down the aisle she wasn't just coming to get my name when she married me she didn't just get the name Spencer she got me and when you are baptized by the Holy Ghost you don't just take on his name you get him he said they never leave you that he never forsake you he'd be with you even unto the end of the world if the Queen of England is not ashamed to act like a queen how about the Queen of Heaven we should never be ashamed of our kingdom and to us act like a queen of heaven woo look at Moses after his burning bush experience he was not ashamed to go down to Egypt and proclaim that God is coming down to deliver his children he was not ashamed to stand there in the face of the religions of the world at that time he was not ashamed to stand there in the face of I the greatest army in hell in the world he was not ashamed to stand in front of Pharaoh he was not ashamed to stand in front of which doctors and magicians of the day I stretch for this rod and declare the power of Almighty God he was not ashamed to do it because God was with him who hallelu he'd stand there in the face of all of the criticism and all the doubters and it stretched through that rod and miracles would take place why because he was a son of God before the world began God knew that Moses was going to be that deliverer God was not ashamed of Moses and Moses was not a sane to step up and say the God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob met him in a bus that was not consumed and he told me that I am come down to deliver that same God has come down to Laodicea to deliver his children he was doing all of these mighty miracles under the blood of bulls and goats which could not take away sin how about you and me how about you and me there are under a perfect blood that are under a perfect token we've come under the slogan should we be ashamed of the miracles that take place which should we be surprised bound absolutely not it's a perfect Savior it's a perfect Redeemer it's a perfect sacrifice I'll tell you hey don't blow my mind when I see cancers fall off it does not blow my mind when I see young people rise up I expect these things because God said it would be there he don't surprise me it just makes me fall in love with him or it makes me realize that he's the same yesterday today and forever I wonder do you see Jesus every day of your life let me ask you another question can you see Jesus in you when Moses was standing here he was not standing with a crowd he was not standing with the who's who he was standing by himself but God was with him he said I'm not capable speaking he's will I give you your brother Abel Aaron to be to be your spokesman he was standing there not with two hundred not with two million at the time but he was standing there by a commission of the Lord to let my people go he was standing there and he was going down the road de jure to go in there and take over the greatest nations that there was at that time brother branham said it goes to show you that no matter how much in the minority that you are as long as you're led by the Holy Ghost one is a majority below Berto said that God shakes the majority by the minority he said that you and God are the majority hallelujah you may look like nobody else is standing with you but you and God if you're standing with God you're standing as a majority look at your neighbors say I'm standing with the majority I am the majority church's quickening power will put you in your provided place men and women it'll make you stand to your feet it'll make you do things that God wants you to do I don't care what somebody else says about it the neighbor says all that person they've lost their mind they pray all night they read their Bible I don't care what they say it's what God told you to do all day they say we can't have these old-fashioned Pentecostal revivals oh yes we can - you can have it in yourself and you and you are the majority in God and no matter what the rest of them think they want to say we shouldn't breach no more but me and God's a majority they want to tell me I shouldn't testify no more but me and God's a majority they want to tell me that I shouldn't speak in tongues no more but me and God's a majority they want to tell me that I shouldn't dance but me and God's a majority you let the world do what they want to do I'm gonna stand with Jesus a man who has once come in contact with God which is the word and the word has has been made plain and manifested to him there's no sameness about that you're not embarrassed it don't embarrass me to say that I believe every word of God it doesn't embarrass me when the Lord says to say anything you go and say it and do it and don't embarrass me to say that I've been filled with the Holy Ghost can I get a witness they don't embarrass me to say that I've spoke with other tongues can I get a witness he don't embarrass me to say that our Lord has some admissions he don't embarrass me to say that he's the same yesterday today and forever can I get a witness in the house of God it don't make me ashamed to say that God still God that God still pouring out she wants you me God it's a reality and when you meet God you're going to cut when you meet God and you're standing by yourself you're gonna have to come up against opposition brother Branham was standing alone in this generation his closest friend in the ministry at the time would have been MF Bosworth but there was nobody that walked in the realms where William Branham walked in there was nobody that knew what was taking place like he did he was standing alone when he would stand there in 1933 or no higher banks of the river there and he would stand there baptized in the 17th person and a voice from heaven came and said as John the Baptist forerun the first coming of Christ so were your message William Branham for running the second coming of Christ he was standing all alone come on somebody when he's standing there in the 1940s to come out in the greatest revival healing revival that ever took place and come out and say I met an angel in a cave there was nobody else Billy Graham in aaand and Oral Roberts and all these other words they could not say that they met an angel but this William Branham stood there it said that this angel told me of my peculiar birth he was standing alone he was standing alone with 300 when 300 preachers in Chicago they were contesting him over water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and serpent Satan II of these other doctrines they were contending with him he was standing alone Oh hallelujah he was standing alone when he would say there in 1962 in 1963 that seven angels met me in a cluster of a cloud and told me to go back to Jeffersonville and preach the seven seals he was standing alone he was standing alone in 1965 when he's standing there in California and he is preaching the choosing of a bride and he says oh they're Los Angeles you're going to see beneath the ocean he was standing alone when there was people thinking that there's going to be a rapture and on the other side there was people lighting up cigarettes I know where I'd have been standing at come on somebody if you would be smoking a cigarette you might as well walk out of here tonight because this message is not for unbelievers this message is for the believers if that embarrasses you I'm sorry but I'm not backing up on what I believe this God birthed me this God changed me this God filled me I was a boy that needed the baptism of the Holy Ghost when I married my wife and a year later in Canada that God met me on a street you think I'm ashamed to tell about it brother Samuel you think I'm ashamed to tell about your deliverance that God gives you a perfect liver for your vessel I'm not a saying to testify that God still heals thank God still wants to doctor us can I get a witness that God still heals cancer can I get a witness hello hello hello that God still saves can I get a witness that God still deliver us can I get a witness [Applause] he was standing alone he's standing alone and other people are questioning him over speaking squirrels into existence some of his closest friends are questioning these things but had a rod said that's nothing but the truth and the Spirit of the Lord says give her what she asked for and God gave her her sons I'm not ashamed to testify about that I've watched that same spirit swoop in slip into these meetings like tonight and you say something that's incredibly too far for your mind to figure out and God hears your prayer and it manifests just like asking hello he was standing alone when he spoke a storm out of existence but the community had to recognize that something happened there was a storm coming up the strangest thing I was a storm coming up and all of a sudden it left you don't say you know there's a people down and out they act awful and kind of funny you don't say they act like they're drunk old new life you don't say they're not ashamed to testify there's something there's something different about them you don't say Church I told you six to seven

[Applause] hallelujah I don't know if you know this or not but you showed up to have Church John was not ashamed of the Word of God that came to him in the wilderness and told him to go baptize with water he wasn't ashamed to say behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world for the Spirit of God was upon him he wasn't a same before the priest he wasn't ashamed of the Word of God when he walked up to Herod's Phillips wife was living with Herod walked right up in the face of the king this whole holy face fell out in the wilderness there come out there with no education or nothing else and walked right up to the face of Herod and said it's not lawful for you to have her we need men of God like getting a pulpit again and you're looking at somebody that's willing to do the job walked right up in the face of Herod and said it's not lawful for you to have her he wasn't ashamed of God's Word he absolutely was not ashamed of it Stephen he wasn't ashamed of God's Word first Pentecostal people up there in the day of Pentecost when they gathered in the upper room the Holy Ghost fell upon them by our promise of God and Luke 24 and 49 said behold I send the promise of my father upon you but wait in the city of Jerusalem until you receive power from on high and the very promise that God that the Word of God promises behold I send the promise of my father upon you but wait there don't go get no more theology or education and so forth you wait till you're in do with power and when that power from heaven came like a rushing mighty wind they was not ashamed of the gospel Peter stood up among them and said repent every one of you you men with wicked hands who crucified the Prince of Peace which God has raised from the dead and we are witness for this is what Joe said would come to pass in the last days I'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh he was not ashamed of the gospel that's the heritage of the states Jo - and 25 says I and I will restore to you the years that the locusts have eaten the cake a worm the caterpillar and the Palmer were my great army which I sent among you and ye shall eat him plenty somebody say eating plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that hath dealt one Dursley with you and my people and my people shall never be ashamed and you shall know that I am in the midst of Israel and that I am the Lord your God and none else and my people are you his people tonight and my people shall never be ashamed and it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions Church this is that what you're experiencing what they experienced in Louisiana what they're experiencing all over the world this is that which Joe prophesied about you are his people you are called of God you are Dane before the world began before Laodicea ever was into existence you are ordained to live out this day you were thought of before the world began you were elected you were chosen you were bought you were purchased and Satan cannot have you [Music] Satan cannot have our children Satan cannot have our protocol they may look like produções right now but when they get here and God takes care of business they won't look like Prada khals no more God Oh feed kill the fatted calf God will dress them in His Holiness there's three ladies that are sitting here in our congregation maybe more than that now but it all came in about the same time that were cheerleaders and you'd never pick them out in this crowd translate the cheerleaders of this day but when they came to this our pastor specifically never preached on dress code until they got it and they got it before he ever had to preach on it ain't a right God is the one that does the dressing if I tell you how to dress head ain't living that's just me telling you but when you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost on the inside he'll make your dress right he'll make your walk right he'll make you talk right he'll make you live right hello Satan cannot have you and I'm willing to fight for every single one of you some of you that like sleeping through church I'm willing to fight for you too and if your mamas and your daddies don't get to waking up your sons and your daughters I'm gonna tell you something right now they're gonna be sleeping through the rapture hello are you whipping tonight you still but I a ban me right here now I know there's some pistol-packing Mama's in this church tonight that ain't afraid that when somebody comes up in here that we're trying to take over your children or try to come in your house and try to hurt your family you know what you do you know what you do but you ought to be ashamed of yourselves for letting you momma's and daddies are lettin somebody woke up in your house and kill your sons and daughters by watching these video games you just did the same thing they're watching murder after murder after murder on a video game but don't you dare mess with them in the flesh her mama's coming out they ought to be some mamas that's not a shame to testify I'm not going to let that trash come in my house no more stay up all night playing a basketball game you ought to be ashamed of yourself if you're gonna stay up all night stay up praying stay up reading this message reading this Bible something that's got rapturing power in it oh yeah we're going to do something do something useful for your soul [Applause] you still love me good it's God I'm talking to you about tonight he thought so much of you by the same he thought so much love you sister faith that he came from heaven to earth and he took on the robe of humanity now notice what Paul says about her kinsmen and I in Hebrews 2 and 7 thou madest him a little lower than the angels thou crowned us him of glory and honour and did it set him over the works of thy hands now has put all things in subjection under his feet for in that he put all in subjection under him he left nothing that is not put under him somebody say nothing but now we see not yet all things put under him but we see Jesus who was made a little lower than the Angels for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man that God thought of you for it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things in bringing him many sons and the glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings I want you to know that God that is fight for you the captain of the Lord's hosts that's fighting for you has never lost the battle he's never lost the case cancers never defeated him sadness has never defeated him depression has never defeated him none of your problems have ever stopped my god none of them verse 11 for both he that sanctifies and they who are sanctified are all of one for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren notice God's attitude towards you he acknowledges himself has been a part of the same family as you it may have been unexpected that God would give the name brethren to us that were degraded us that had a wrecked up life us that were humble us that were broken he gave us the title of brethren with him to those that he came to redeem he was willing to be raped with them and be regarded and your family I've been looking at that scripture for four weeks now I still can't get over you mean you really do that brother Andrew you just look at one scripture some I will do it I'll look over one scripture until he unfolds himself to me it ain't about reading 15 chapters chapters a day Charles Spurgeon said some men like to read Bible right I'd like to read chapters as long as they're armed but they don't understand one thing about it I'd rather read one scripture and they'd do my whole mouth good then to read 15 chapters a day and I don't get nothing out of it I've been looking over this scripture and it's overwhelming to me that he would look at all of my mistakes he's seen me in all of my troubles he's seen me in my sickness he's seen when I sins he's seen what I was in fault he's seen when I lied he's seen when I cheated he's seen when I stole he's seen me in my despair but he said I am not ashamed to call you brethren some of you it looks like you can't get out of the pit but I want you to know that God is not ashamed to call you brethren that thoughts overwhelming that he see when I was that close to death maybe just a little bit more I wouldn't even be here Church hate ain't nothing but the grace of God that you're standing here it ain't nothing but the mercies of God that you still live I know some of your histories I know what you've been through I know some of the deepest darkest things that you don't want told but even at all of your misery he said I am not ashamed to be called bread now it's one thing for me to say that I am not ashamed of him but when he says that I'm not ashamed of you I want you to know I could dance all the way I'd rather dance tonight than preach I could dance all the way from Elkton to grottoes tonight of that thought right there that he is not ashamed of me me being filled with the Holy Ghost and still wake up on Monday and still have thoughts that would make me worthy of death but he would say that I am not ashamed to call them brethren what is it there's a perfect blood on the altar tonight he's included every trouble he's included every mistake enough where he says I am not ashamed to call them breath and what Satan comes up against you Jesus says check the bloodline check out the DNA I know you can spit in the tube and send it off to Kalamazoo and they'll tell you where you came from and tell you where your ancestry is how you lived in this part of the world I know where I came from I ain't got a spitting no tube and spending $100 to know where I came from I came from God and I'm going back to God I didn't come from the Blue Ridge Mountains I came from glory I come from a place where there's gonna be satin on the hills you want to check out my DNA just go over in the book of Hebrews chapter 11 that's my DNA right there don't look at David go look at Daniel don't look go look at go look at Sam go that's my family history there's all kinds of things in my family history that I'm ashamed about but there's nothing in my second birth that I'm ashamed about can I get a witness one time it was a boy that had got himself in trouble he was a good boy but he went to court and the judge said I find you guilty and I must punish you to life in prison he said I want to try my own case it sounded like some of you had a whole a whole lot of things stacked up against you he said I want to try my own case he said I want to go up on my own record he said you have no record your records what's condemning you that's the way it is today the reason the church is not advanced like it should it's the record it's the life we must become more dedicated somebody say more dedicated we must believe every word of God we must seek until that word is made real to us the record is what keeps us from entering it but one time in this same court there was a boy that had no money and he could not pay it off the fine this there was way in a thousands of dollars but he had a big brother that came and paid it all for him now we've got a big brother Jesus the Son of God he came to pay it off for us if we'll just believe it and be able to enter into the veil with him your records what's condemning you but the Bible tells me over in Romans chapter 8 there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit your record is dismissed Church I want to say it to you your future is clear your future is greater than your past your big brother Jesus is in the house Hebrews 11 and 16 says wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God somebody say that where for God is not ashamed to be called their God he's talking about you look at your neighbors he's talking about me I notice it if Jesus defeated Satan upon faith knowing who he was he was free day and predestinated creature are you ready what about the predestinated bride of Jesus Christ you believe the bride is read estimated the predestinated Bride of Christ now the church the word seed which with everything that God promised to put in the church in it right now it's in it right now everything that he promised the church is in it right now everything is ordered there are the Holy Spirit has been given the seed has been sold the evening likes his son the sign of Sodom that jesus promises here Malachi for a predestinate a church hold ever Church of the Living God here in old tape do you know where you stand do you know that you were called of God that the Holy Ghost rings in your heart and every word of God is real to you how is Satan going to stand against that tell me how Satan is going to stand against that predestinated Church how is he going to stop that from going how is he going to keep them signs from following it why you could throw them in jail they if you could I don't care what you do they done tried it they rot it they they rot it in the jail's they was fed to the Lions they were sold to Sunday they were attacked to pieces you can't kill it right a church has predestinated those who for he foreknew like he did Jesus he has called and those who his called his justified and those who

you can't get over it it looks like it's a wall that you can't penetrate it looks like a wall that you can't break through God is resting in his love he said to you that joy is returning and you opened the door some of you were afraid to exercise it I know some of you did it and didn't swim in the video and that's okay but I know it some of you that was ashamed to do it because you like holding on to your fear and you like hanging on to your hypochondriac spirit that you got you love living with your devil so you didn't open up your door and let joy in but I want you to know you can still open that door some of you always fear and I'm going to get sick with this or I'm gonna get sick with that some of you like to get sick that's because you're in in a place where you're worshipping Devils if you want to get sick and you want to get sick and lay up in a hospital that proves to me that you got a perverted spirit but I wanna preach to you tonight a dog that is big enough to take that devil off of you God didn't put you here to be sick he put you here to be healthy that's a devil whispering in your ear that says he got there so you say they got that stopped listening to the lies of the devil stop giving in to his tactics you might be the same to open the door but open the door in half and let joy Russell there and start singing he feels my life with laughter he will joy over thee weave sing it to me I can't I can't hardly fathom at that there is a super that's a more than ordinary worship that's going on in heaven when God Himself is singing over you brother Denny I wonder what God is singing I know they're gonna make it I know that they can stand I predestinated them before the world began oh I can hear God's singing out tonight you are my joy and I am rejoicing over you the Bible said that there is rejoicing in the presence of angels over one that repenteth you just wait you think you've seen something you just wait you ain't seen nothing yet in larger tents you just wait drop down a stake you just wait you think we do sound here I can't wait to see what's going on in heaven when this joy unspeakable and full of glory coming from the throne verse 18 I don't know what I've ever enjoyed preaching Lord I got Satan staring me in the face and I got God looking him right back in the eye and saying back up it's a pleasure for me tonight to stand in this position and watch the fight go off it's a real joy for me to watch it go on tonight for this is what God says that I will gather them that are sorrowful for the solemn assembly who are of V to whom the reproach of it was a burden behold at that time I will undo God is saying I will deal with this devil I will handle this thing I'm big enough I'm strong enough I'm mighty enough I'm God enough I will undo oh that afflicts thee I will save her that halter and gather her that was driven out God's doing it and I will get them praise and fame in every land where they have been put to shame that devil tried to make a mockery of your life but God's getting your Fame and praise in that land you may have been looked down upon in the community but God's got your praise God's got your Fame God's got this sister Wanda if Joy's coming in the Holy Ghost is coming in open up big gates and let the King of glory come on in I'm not ashamed of the devil don't like me

know are people that do if you like it how about preach it to you some more God says I will gather them I will bring them here I'm going to same to be called their brother numbers and daddies Pro proclaim the token of your household may this be the night may this be the night at that time will I bring you again even in the time that I gathered you for I will make you a name and a praise among all the people of the earth when the world is promoting himself God's promoting you when I turned back your captivity when I turn back the chains that once held you bound before your our safe Lord I will get you praise I will I wonder tonight if God is the same to this scripture how could God be ashamed of his own word he's never had a new phone he's never had a new word he's not ashamed of what he said about you and he ain't planning on changing his mind through all of your sin through all of your mistakes through all of your despair when you were in your valley he was not ashamed you got you got a few more minutes for me now I might as well go ahead and exhaust this thought while I'm on it there's a mighty God amongst us that deserves to be praised there's a mighty God that has amongst us that deserved to be worshipped and the Bible tells me in Romans 10:10 that for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation for the scripture saith that whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed are you a witness to that scripture tonight the Bible says in 2nd Timothy 1 is 7 for God has not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind be not therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord God don't want a coward God don't want somebody that's the same to testify that's afraid to go down to the altar God don't want somebody that's a shame to say that by His stripes I was healed they don't want somebody that's ashamed to say that God still feels I don't want somebody that's a shame to say that God is the same yesterday today and forever if you're that type of person that's a shame to testify God can't use you what God wants to do is take that wishbone out of you and give you a backbone cell like a so long that you'll be able to testify to your boss on Monday morning David said in Psalms 119 to 46 I will speak of thy testimonies before kings and I will not be ashamed before David was ever in a place of position he was testifying to saw that his God was able enough that his God was big enough the God that delivered me from the hand of the bear in a line is more than able to deliver me from this giant he was not ashamed to testify for the king of a kiss and and the Prince of Philistines he was not ashamed to testify matter of fact when Kings came into David's courts when David was the king over Israel David before every star before he ever started talking about the estate's affair or they affair the affairs of the state he began testifying of the testimonies of God before we wake up and read about the politics of the day we ought to testify somebody we ought to testify that there's a god that is amongst us that he's still the same yesterday today and forever David wasn't ashamed to testify about the three Hebrew children weren't afraid to testify about Paul wasn't ashamed to testify about it before Nero and before Felix and fetus he was not ashamed to testify that there was a God that was in him a god that was delivering him and God that had saved him and God that had filled him Paul thought that he was worth testifying about even through all the afflictions that he had to endure he was not ashamed you remember when brother bantam went up there to miss walk and he come back and he told his wife hope he says honey I have found the people that is not ashamed of their religion they're not afraid to testify they're not afraid to shout they're not afraid to speak in tongues they're not afraid to testify they're not afraid of it there's a people there that's not ashamed of their religion that kind of people's in the building tonight if you're ashamed to testify before you ever see the promise come to pass God can't use you but Mary she was not ashamed to say that she had met an angel and that she was going to bring for the child I want you to know that we have met an angel in this day and we are bringing forth the son of man in this hour and he's still speaking and I'm not ashamed to testify of the son of man David said in Psalms 145 I will extol thee my god o King I will bless thy name forever and ever he was not ashamed to praise God every day will I bless thee and I will praise thy name for ever and ever great is the Lord and greatly to be praised and his greatness is unsearchable some of you sit there like a bump on a
