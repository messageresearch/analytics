[41:36] That was powerful, buddy.
[41:39] Now, look, I heard y'all last night give
[41:41] some rebel yells.
[41:43] We can have one more today, can't we?
[41:49] God bless you, buddy.
[41:52] That was wonderful.
[41:57] Sister Melissa sent me some pictures
[41:59] while a couple weeks ago of me and Sam.
[42:01] I I was carrying Sam up here to sing
[42:04] when uh we used to have the little kids
[42:06] come up and sing and whatnot. I said,
[42:08] "Well, it's time to have him do it
[42:09] again, but I'm not going to carry him
[42:10] this time." So So would you stand with
[42:13] us this morning? Kia F.

[44:07] When he looks at me, he treasures what
[44:11] he sees.

[44:18] or on my brightest days,
[44:21] I will trust the Lord no matter what
[44:25] comes my way. Oh, I am not ashamed of
[44:31] the gospel.
[44:34] Oh, I am not ashamed of the Lord.
[44:40] Oh, I am not ashamed to be carrying the
[44:46] name of Jesus. I will never be ashamed.

[45:00] Because of him, I will never be the
[45:04] same.

[45:37] names.

[46:13] Give the Lord a hand clap of praise.
[46:16] Hallelujah.
[46:20] Hallelujah. We just want to uh make
[46:23] mention to you uh this year our Labor
[46:26] Day meetings. They'll be here uh at I
[46:30] believe it's let me just give you the
[46:31] exact dates. I'm sorry. It's always
[46:33] Labor Day weekend.
[46:38] Praise the Lord.
[46:40] It is
[46:42] August the 30th. No, I'm sorry. That is
[46:45] the wrong month. I hate when they do
[46:47] stupid stuff like that. Anyways, August
[46:50] 29th, 30th, and 31st, we'll be having
[46:54] our our meetings here uh at the church
[46:57] this year. We have uh decided just to
[47:00] have it here this year. It might be a
[47:02] little bit packed, but we're going to
[47:03] have a good time.
[47:04] So, that just means you're going to have
[47:06] to get to church a little bit earlier.
[47:07] We we built these built this place with
[47:10] uh with the doors back here at the back
[47:12] and we're just going to uh set out
[47:14] chairs. We might have to stick chairs a
[47:16] little bit everywhere, but we just feel
[47:17] to have it here this year. And so we're
[47:19] just looking under the Lord and maybe if
[47:21] you can just we we probably won't be
[47:23] sending that out all over top of
[47:25] Facebook and everything just due to the
[47:27] just due to the size of of of our
[47:29] building here, but that's just what we
[47:31] feel led to do this year. And so we're
[47:32] just expecting the Lord to do uh great
[47:35] things again. And I know that we'll have
[47:37] some announcements coming up for that um
[47:41] uh for church work days and different
[47:42] things and and we're just thankful that
[47:45] that we can we can host a meeting again
[47:47] this year and we're certainly certainly
[47:50] looking under the Lord. But I I say that
[47:51] we're looking under the Lord this
[47:53] morning as well, aren't we? You know, I
[47:55] I just we're so blessed to have a
[47:58] wonderful pastor like we have and we
[47:59] just want to invite him to come this

[52:17] living here and u I know I know our this
[52:21] nation was raised up to be the homeland
[52:24] of the prophet of the hour and so
[52:27] Amen. We thank the Lord for that and one
[52:30] of the reasons was is we are a country
[52:32] that could could send missionaries all
[52:34] over the world and this message has did
[52:38] just that. It's went all over the world
[52:40] and people from every nation believe
[52:42] this message with all of their hearts
[52:44] and so we're just so thankful to be a
[52:47] small part of that and we've did quite a
[52:48] bit of that kind of work ourselves and
[52:50] and we're so thankful for that. Amen.

[53:56] And uh I call Connie that once in a
[53:59] while, too, so it's okay.
[54:02] Brother John,
[54:04] wait. Last week when I saw you with your
[54:07] hair cut and your beard cut, I thought,
[54:10] who is that guy?
[54:13] And I watched him as I preached last
[54:15] week. I said, I preached to him before
[54:16] cuz he's responding the way that

[54:23] Amen.
[54:23] Amen. That looks good on you.
[54:30] Amen.
[54:37] Amen. We just we want to pray for the
[54:40] people in Texas and my heart is
[54:42] literally shattered and just thinking
[54:45] about what has happened there. And uh
[54:48] you know only God can help them. Only
[54:50] God can help them. And when when tragedy
[54:54] strikes in the middle of the night, it's
[54:56] just hard to get away from it. Mother
[54:58] nature's a a cruel beast. And so we want
[55:01] to pray for them. And and I I cannot
[55:04] imagine being the
[55:07] over top of the youth that has been
[55:09] there all of those years for literally
[55:11] decades and decades. And and tragedy
[55:14] struck them the other night. And you
[55:17] know, a river that goes from 2 foot to
[55:19] 26 27 foot, one place 29 foot. There's
[55:23] no way to get away from that. And so, so
[55:26] we want to we want to pray for those
[55:28] families that God would just be with
[55:29] them and and touch them in a special
[55:31] way. And I believe that prayer can help.
[55:36] I believe prayer can help. And you know,
[55:39] no way can you replace all that, but
[55:42] we've got a friend in Jesus and and
[55:44] he'll help us today. Amen. You love the
[55:46] Lord.
[55:47] Isn't he good to us? Let's turn to First
[55:49] John chapter 1 and verse one. Wonderful
[55:53] message last night. Amen.
[55:55] I'm like brother Andrew. I want to echo
[55:57] the I want to echo the thoughts for
[55:59] brother Matt Mccclar and his wife,
[56:01] Sister Dorothy.
[56:02] They went took their vacation and went
[56:04] and worked and cooked. He preached the
[56:07] first night of the service and had a
[56:09] blowout service and and then and then
[56:13] they cooked three meals a day for 500
[56:16] people. And that's work.
[56:19] Amen.
[56:20] Amen. So,
[56:28] God will reward you. And uh and I know
[56:32] there war completely out. So, if you go
[56:34] to sleep,
[56:35] Amen.
[56:36] we're going to leave you like that. And
[56:37] so, Amen. Amen. I want to speak to you
[56:41] this morning on more than just a story.
[56:45] Come on.
[56:46] I'm just going to start it. That's all I
[56:48] can do is just start it.
[56:50] 1 John chapter 1 and verse one.
[56:54] That which was from the beginning, which
[56:57] we have heard, which we have seen with
[57:00] our eyes, which we have looked upon with
[57:03] our hands and handled of the word of
[57:06] life.
[57:07] For the life was manifested, and we have
[57:10] seen it, and bear witness, and show unto
[57:13] you, that eternal life, which was with
[57:17] the Father, and was manifested unto us,
[57:21] that which we have seen, and heard, and
[57:25] declare unto you, that ye also may have
[57:28] fellowship with us. And truly our
[57:31] fellowship is with the Father, and with
[57:33] his son, Jesus Christ.
[57:36] and these things that write we unto you
[57:40] that your joy may be full. Amen. Maybe
[57:44] you just lay your hands on one another
[57:46] there just now and maybe have a need
[57:48] today and you say, "Lord, I have
[57:50] incredible needs and I just ask him to
[57:53] come by my way." Father, we love you
[57:56] with all of our hearts today and we
[57:59] thank you for the presence of this
[58:00] audience and we thank you for your
[58:03] goodness and your kindness. I ask you
[58:05] that you would anoint our hearts in a
[58:07] special way today and anoint the
[58:10] speaker. Lord, I I just ask you that you
[58:13] would anoint not just the speaker but
[58:15] also this audience that God would you
[58:18] would come by and we want you to get all
[58:21] the glory and the honor and the praise
[58:24] today. And we have many needs and I ask
[58:28] you to touch us in a special way. We
[58:30] pray in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. And
[58:33] amen. And amen. You may be seated.
[58:46] When I begin to think of how I would
[58:47] open this up and our audience and being
[58:50] our 25th year here, I I I thought I
[58:53] would just share a couple of things.
[58:56] We've got new ones that are among us
[58:58] that don't know, but we come from a
[59:01] legacy of of of preachers.
[59:05] Amen.
[59:05] My father was a preacher. My grandfather
[59:07] was a preacher. My great-grandfather was
[59:09] a preacher. Now I've got the other side
[59:11] of that too, bootleggers and all of
[59:14] that. And so,
[59:16] so anyway, we come from that that realm.
[59:18] And even back in the Civil War, uh we
[59:21] had ministers there. Timothy actually
[59:24] the one that came to America was Timothy
[59:26] Spencer and he was a preacher and he
[59:29] came here and had four sons and they
[59:31] begin to spread out and some of them
[59:33] came to Virginia. We're not here to give
[59:35] you that historical, but I grew up in a
[59:37] home and then I would marry Sister
[59:39] Connie and and Brother Homer was a
[59:42] preacher. And as as brother Homer was
[59:45] the pastor of this church and had the
[59:46] vision to to begin this church and
[59:49] started out in Brother Bill's basement,
[59:52] then into another building, construction
[59:54] building, and then into the house that's
[59:56] actually up for sale right now. and uh
[1:00:00] uh that they converted to a church and
[1:00:02] now it's back to a house. If you want to
[1:00:04] buy it, it's like $458,000.
[1:00:06] We should have kept that thing. So,
[1:00:10] and so so anyway, here we are in 199091.
[1:00:14] We begin to build this building and and
[1:00:17] I I watched I don't want to talk too
[1:00:19] much about that, but I I just want to
[1:00:21] bring a couple of stories.
[1:00:24] Amen. into a supernatural realm. Working
[1:00:28] here with brother Homer as associate
[1:00:30] pastor and pastor, we worked together
[1:00:33] like a charm and we just enjoyed one
[1:00:35] another and enjoyed his company. All of
[1:00:38] us loved his singing and loved his
[1:00:39] preaching.
[1:00:41] He could preach baptism greater than any
[1:00:43] preacher that I know of. And
[1:00:45] he could also preach and he could get on
[1:00:47] your toes to where you were pulling your
[1:00:49] your toes up under the chair. And
[1:00:51] but we watched him with his love. His
[1:00:53] heart was as big as a car and and he
[1:00:56] just had a love for the underdog, he
[1:00:59] would say. And but we watched
[1:01:01] supernatural events took take place. And
[1:01:04] one particular day we were called to go
[1:01:06] to the hospital in UVA and we went there
[1:01:09] and it was one of the most astounding
[1:01:11] stories. And we went there and one of
[1:01:13] the brothers had called and asked us to
[1:01:16] go to a neighbor and this boy was about
[1:01:19] 20 years old and he was literally
[1:01:21] mangled. I've never seen anything like
[1:01:24] that. He was just mangled and twisted.
[1:01:27] And in his twisting that his whole body
[1:01:30] was contorted in such a way his arms
[1:01:32] were contorted, his legs were contorted.
[1:01:35] Actually, even his his own uh neck was
[1:01:39] contorted to where it was kind of
[1:01:41] flipped all the way around even to So,
[1:01:44] the doctors told us said, "Don't touch
[1:01:46] him. Just don't touch him. We're trying
[1:01:48] to keep him in a state of where to where
[1:01:51] that we can begin to work on him. We've
[1:01:54] got we've got to begin to work on him.
[1:01:56] His mother and father was sitting there
[1:01:58] and their minds were blown. It was a car
[1:02:00] wreck that had happened and we walked in
[1:02:03] and and of course we didn't know anybody
[1:02:06] and we walked in and and just told them
[1:02:08] who he was and and and we laid our hands
[1:02:12] on the handrail of the bed and and we
[1:02:14] laid our hands on that handrail and and
[1:02:16] we begin to pray. They told us don't
[1:02:19] touch him. Don't lay your hands on him.
[1:02:21] And so we just laid our hands on that
[1:02:24] handrail and begin to pray and and just
[1:02:26] ask God to for him to be merciful.
[1:02:31] The next day, you know, we never saw him
[1:02:33] ever again, but the next day
[1:02:37] they came in. When the parents came in,
[1:02:40] he was sitting up on the side of the
[1:02:42] bed.
[1:02:43] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:02:45] [Applause]
[1:02:53] And he said, "They've already released
[1:02:55] me to go home." And he said, "You can
[1:02:57] take me to go home. I'm going to be all
[1:02:59] right."
[1:03:01] And so they asked him, said, "What
[1:03:04] happened?" said, "Well, wasn't y'all
[1:03:07] here last night when those two angels
[1:03:10] walked into the building and
[1:03:13] they had wings on
[1:03:15] and said, "They didn't touch me, but
[1:03:17] they laid their hands on the bed."
[1:03:20] Mom, didn't you see the wings that were
[1:03:23] on those two men?
[1:03:27] You know, we don't feel like we've got
[1:03:29] angel wings.
[1:03:31] But there's an angel that's with us.
[1:03:33] Amen.
[1:03:37] I grew up in that kind of home. And in
[1:03:39] my home growing up, my father started
[1:03:43] believing the message in the early 60s.
[1:03:48] And so we begin to get the tapes as soon
[1:03:50] as we could get the tapes. In those
[1:03:52] days, the tape recorder was I I was born
[1:03:56] and they paid $100 for me to be be born
[1:04:00] and go through the hospital stay. In
[1:04:03] those days, the tape recorder that we
[1:04:05] would play those tapes on was $350.
[1:04:10] Amen.
[1:04:11] So, three and a half times what it was
[1:04:14] to get me and my brother here. The tape
[1:04:17] recorder was there. We heard brother
[1:04:19] Brandham's message as long as I can
[1:04:22] remember. And so, me and my brother
[1:04:25] would stand and we would we would stand
[1:04:28] and help brother Brandham quote the
[1:04:30] message. And so we would we would go and
[1:04:34] there was a time you remember you flip
[1:04:36] that you flip the tape record the the
[1:04:38] realtore over and so you would feed it
[1:04:41] back through. And so uh we just love
[1:04:44] that. We love to hear brother Brandham
[1:04:46] tell those stories and enjoy those
[1:04:48] stories. And you know I I I grew up in a
[1:04:51] home that believed in the supernatural.
[1:04:53] And
[1:04:54] my dad I saw so many things. One day we
[1:04:56] were on our way to church and and and
[1:04:59] there was a sister that had cancer. She
[1:05:01] was down to 85 lbs and she had cancer
[1:05:04] and so she was going to die. She had a
[1:05:07] huge gorder on her throat and and just
[1:05:11] massive. And anyway, this woman I'd went
[1:05:13] to church with for for all my life at
[1:05:16] that time. And so dad said, "God just
[1:05:19] spoke to me to go by and pray for her."
[1:05:22] So we went by and prayed for her and the
[1:05:24] cancer rire as we would walk in. It just
[1:05:27] rire and of course she was in a horrible
[1:05:30] shape waiting to die. Dad walked in and
[1:05:33] laid his hands on her and prayed for
[1:05:35] her. And he said, "God's not just going
[1:05:38] to heal you. He's going to restore you
[1:05:41] back to your weight." And he asked her
[1:05:43] the question, "How much did you weigh?"
[1:05:46] Amen.
[1:05:47] Now, that would have been a tough
[1:05:48] question. She was at 85 lbs and she said
[1:05:51] I weighed 235.
[1:05:54] I'm not going to ask any sister here if
[1:05:56] they weigh 235 or not, but she said I
[1:05:58] weighed 235. He said get ready. Don't
[1:06:02] throw those dresses away. Get ready.
[1:06:05] Come on.
[1:06:06] God healed her.
[1:06:08] And God took her back to that weight of
[1:06:11] 235bs.
[1:06:13] You have never seen anybody so happy to
[1:06:16] be fat.
[1:06:19] Amen.
[1:06:29] Brother Ron, you calling me fat? No, you
[1:06:31] missed the story.
[1:06:33] Amen.
[1:06:36] As a little boy, I watched a
[1:06:39] supernatural happen.
[1:06:40] Amen. I I I we went to a tent meeting
[1:06:45] one night and and dad was there and mom
[1:06:48] was there. Of course, we were children.
[1:06:50] I my brother will be watching and he
[1:06:52] might remember this. And my dad, the
[1:06:55] minister, took the stage. It was quite a
[1:06:57] large meeting. And and my dad, we were
[1:07:00] sitting. I can remember where we were
[1:07:01] sitting about where brother Terry would
[1:07:03] be sitting in that tent. And so anyway,
[1:07:06] dad got up and all of a sudden he began
[1:07:08] to speak in tongues. Then when he spoke
[1:07:11] in tongues, then he he began to speak.
[1:07:14] And he began to speak to that preacher
[1:07:16] that was standing in the pull pit. And
[1:07:18] he said, "I see you today with another
[1:07:22] woman."
[1:07:24] And called out the hotel and the number
[1:07:27] of the of the door that was on the
[1:07:29] hotel.
[1:07:31] Now, that man immediately ran.
[1:07:35] Amen.
[1:07:36] He ran out of that building as at 10 as
[1:07:38] fast as he could.
[1:07:39] You know, that caused quite a chaos in
[1:07:41] that tent meeting. And so they they
[1:07:46] said, "You preach."
[1:07:50] You know,
[1:07:52] you know, we see we have seen I could
[1:07:55] stand here forever and say that we have
[1:07:57] seen the awesome power of this message.
[1:08:02] Amen.
[1:08:07] Most everybody here has got a story that
[1:08:09] you can say, "I met him."
[1:08:12] Amen.
[1:08:13] I met him.
[1:08:15] And you read scriptures. And they're
[1:08:17] more than just scriptures to which that
[1:08:20] that you read over and over again. But
[1:08:24] every one of those scriptures has power
[1:08:26] in it.
[1:08:27] Power to release you and minister to
[1:08:30] you. And it isn't timed dated to where
[1:08:35] that it's no longer works. This message
[1:08:38] will never come to a spot to where it's
[1:08:41] antiquated.
[1:08:42] That's right.
[1:08:44] Because it's Jesus Christ the same
[1:08:46] yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:08:49] Now, the reason I can stand and and then
[1:08:52] I can watch I can watch my children and
[1:08:55] how that has happened. This message
[1:08:58] works.
[1:09:00] Yes.
[1:09:01] If you're in a situation to where that
[1:09:04] you're having marriage issues or you're
[1:09:06] having issues in your life, let me just
[1:09:08] say, as brother Andrew said last night,
[1:09:11] no doubt he didn't know what I was
[1:09:12] preaching today. Let me just say, just
[1:09:15] immerse yourself in Christ.
[1:09:19] Just immerse yourself in Jesus Christ.
[1:09:22] He will work out every marriage issue.
[1:09:27] If you're depressed, just put yourself
[1:09:29] in Christ. He'll take care of every
[1:09:32] anxiety, every need in your life.
[1:09:42] Young people, you no doubt don't have an
[1:09:45] idea sometimes because many times we'll
[1:09:47] have seven or eight different careers in
[1:09:49] our life and we go, I want to be this
[1:09:51] and I want to be this and I want to be
[1:09:52] this. Well, generally that's not what
[1:09:54] you'll wind up to be.
[1:09:57] And so, and so, and so we begin our
[1:10:00] journey and we begin our life.
[1:10:04] When I began my Christian journey, I was
[1:10:07] here uh I was here and I was Sister
[1:10:11] Donna,
[1:10:13] I'm looking for you. Sister Donna was
[1:10:15] playing the piano and uh down at the
[1:10:18] other church, Brother Bill Hinkle prayed
[1:10:20] with me that night. And I'll never
[1:10:22] forget these words and it's very
[1:10:24] important today.
[1:10:26] I prayed. I needed the Holy Ghost
[1:10:31] because I'd been a I'd been a bad boy, a
[1:10:35] naughty boy.
[1:10:37] I had a history that I needed to be
[1:10:39] taken care of.
[1:10:40] Amen.
[1:10:41] I'd been raised in these kind of homes,
[1:10:44] but I didn't know God.
[1:10:46] Amen. Are you listen? God wants more
[1:10:50] than church members.
[1:10:54] He wants more than just somebody that
[1:10:57] will sit in a pew,
[1:10:59] somebody that will clap their hands. He
[1:11:01] wants more than that.
[1:11:03] He wants your tabernacle to be a
[1:11:05] tabernacle to where he can come and
[1:11:08] live.
[1:11:10] Not just on Sunday morning, but he wants
[1:11:13] to live in your life. He wants to be a
[1:11:16] carpenter. He wants to be a plumber. He
[1:11:19] wants to be a brick layer.
[1:11:22] He wants to be a doctor. He wants to be
[1:11:24] a lawyer. He wants to Paul say in the
[1:11:27] inside of you. He wants to be a business
[1:11:30] owner.
[1:11:34] And I prayed at that piano. I said,
[1:11:36] "God, I want more than my mother's
[1:11:40] experience. Come on.
[1:11:42] I want more than my father's experience.
[1:11:46] I need my own personal experience with
[1:11:50] you.
[1:11:52] Amen. Come on.
[1:11:55] Cuz I knew I couldn't live it.
[1:11:58] I knew I couldn't do it on my own.
[1:12:02] And that night, God is as good as his
[1:12:05] word.
[1:12:07] Saw the hunger of my heart.
[1:12:10] He dropped into my heart and be begin to
[1:12:13] fill my life with the Holy Ghost.
[1:12:15] Amen.
[1:12:18] Now, as I began my journey, Dad would
[1:12:21] take me to meetings because he wanted me
[1:12:23] to get into the presence of the Lord to
[1:12:25] keep me that way as much as he could.
[1:12:27] And I would go to meetings
[1:12:30] and preachers would begin an audience
[1:12:32] like this. They'd call me out and say,
[1:12:34] "You, sir, you're a young man. God's
[1:12:37] calling you to preach." I didn't want to
[1:12:39] hear it.
[1:12:41] I didn't want to hear it. Call me out. I
[1:12:45] want you to preach. God's calling you to
[1:12:47] preach. Henry Green, Dan Daisley,
[1:12:52] Samuel Johnson,
[1:12:55] Ed Biscll,
[1:12:57] God's calling you to preach. Now, I I
[1:13:00] didn't want to do that cuz that wasn't
[1:13:02] what I was wanting to do. I wanted to
[1:13:05] set in the pew and I wanted to be the
[1:13:07] best pew setter that I could be. I just
[1:13:11] wanted to be a real Christian.
[1:13:12] Amen. Amen.
[1:13:14] But God want be to deal with my heart as
[1:13:17] I was running from the Lord. God be to
[1:13:21] deal with my heart in such a
[1:13:23] supernatural way.
[1:13:26] He began to fill my cup so full I
[1:13:29] couldn't keep it to myself.
[1:13:30] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:13:33] Now, I'd watched the supernatural in my
[1:13:36] dad's life and my brother Frasier's
[1:13:38] life. And of course, we all love brother
[1:13:42] Brandham supernatural. That gift of
[1:13:44] Christ to this generation, only one.
[1:13:48] But I needed more than just
[1:13:52] just their experience. I wanted to have
[1:13:55] my own.
[1:13:57] Listen, you're sitting here today. Why
[1:13:59] don't you just ask him, God, I want you
[1:14:02] to live in my home.
[1:14:04] I want you to live in my life.
[1:14:07] I want to feel you.
[1:14:12] Thank you, Lord.
[1:14:15] Brother Brandham will break into it.
[1:14:18] He says, "Now,"
[1:14:20] he said, "if you read a a love story and
[1:14:24] the back of it said, "And Mary and John
[1:14:26] lived happily ever after." Well, you
[1:14:29] wonder who John and Mary was that lived
[1:14:35] happy ever after. Now, if you want to
[1:14:37] know who John and Mary is, you better go
[1:14:40] back to the first of the book and find
[1:14:43] out who Mary and John is.
[1:14:44] Amen.
[1:14:45] And then get back there. And here you
[1:14:47] find out who Mary was and what family
[1:14:49] she was and where she came from and John
[1:14:51] was and the family that he came from and
[1:14:54] what his name was and how they were
[1:14:56] married and all about like that. That's
[1:14:58] right. He said, "Well, that's the same
[1:15:01] thing reading the Bible."
[1:15:03] Amen.
[1:15:04] He said, "Look, Jesus never said, "Go
[1:15:07] baptize the people in the name of the
[1:15:10] Father and the and the name of the Son
[1:15:12] and the name of the Holy Ghost the way
[1:15:14] the Trinitarian baptized." There's no
[1:15:17] scripture for that in the Bible.
[1:15:19] He never said it in the in the names of
[1:15:22] in the names of the Father and a Son of
[1:15:24] the Holy Ghost. He said in the name.
[1:15:29] In the name. You're talking about more
[1:15:31] than a story.
[1:15:32] Amen. Come on.
[1:15:34] In the name
[1:15:35] where God drops himself in our lives,
[1:15:42] Brother Matthew. We were coming down the
[1:15:44] road this week and we'd been away
[1:15:45] working and Brother Matthew, he was he
[1:15:49] was driving and he said, "Dad, I I want
[1:15:52] you to I'd been kind of dozing
[1:15:55] and he said, "Dad, this may not be a
[1:15:57] good time, but would you just would you
[1:15:59] just talk to me?" Amen.
[1:16:03] Talk to me about adoption. Talk to me
[1:16:05] about predestination. Man, I woke up.
[1:16:08] Amen.
[1:16:10] That's my favorite. That's my very
[1:16:11] favorite spots. And I begin to take him
[1:16:14] back to where, you know, the way that I
[1:16:17] could look at it as a as a young man.
[1:16:21] You know, as a young man in school, I
[1:16:23] was in in drama.
[1:16:25] Now, in drama, you would you would take
[1:16:28] on a part in a script and you would
[1:16:31] learn your script and you would begin to
[1:16:33] kind of figure out what this man was
[1:16:35] like and what this man was like and you
[1:16:38] would learn all your parts and then you
[1:16:40] would take it to the stage and and those
[1:16:42] different kinds of things. Give you for
[1:16:45] instance Charleston H.
[1:16:48] They begin to develop the ten
[1:16:49] commandments. And in the ten
[1:16:51] commandments, they had picked him to be
[1:16:54] the part to be the lead role. And he
[1:16:57] went back and studied everything that he
[1:17:00] could study about the history of Moses.
[1:17:04] His greatest desire it was that you not
[1:17:08] see Mo Charleston H
[1:17:11] but you see Moses. Our
[1:17:16] greatest desire
[1:17:18] is that you not see Ron Spencer.
[1:17:25] Are you with me? That you not see the
[1:17:27] man that is full of mistakes, but you
[1:17:30] see the Christ. Amen.
[1:17:35] And and Charleston H played the part so
[1:17:39] well that after the movie was over, he
[1:17:43] had to go to a place to be rehabbed to
[1:17:47] figure out who Charleston H was again
[1:17:51] because he had become Moses. Right.
[1:17:54] Amen.
[1:17:58] Paul in the scripture talks about I'm a
[1:18:00] prisoner
[1:18:03] of Jesus Christ. You see when he sat at
[1:18:07] the feet of Gale. When he sat at the
[1:18:09] feet of Gale, he learned the word. He
[1:18:12] learned all of the laws. And listen, he
[1:18:15] became such a zeal of the power of the
[1:18:19] word. It was a a story to him that could
[1:18:22] be brought to life.
[1:18:25] But he didn't know who the Messiah was.
[1:18:29] He didn't know the fulfillment of the
[1:18:31] hour of his day.
[1:18:33] But one day,
[1:18:37] he felt really good putting Stephen to
[1:18:40] death.
[1:18:42] He felt good chastising all the
[1:18:45] Christians.
[1:18:46] But one day their story became real to
[1:18:50] him
[1:18:53] when he was on the road to Damascus and
[1:18:55] he was cast down off of his horse
[1:18:59] and he saw that pillar of fire for
[1:19:01] himself.
[1:19:06] Let me say something. To hear about it
[1:19:09] was one thing.
[1:19:14] Brother Chris,
[1:19:16] but to be in that awesome presence of
[1:19:18] God
[1:19:19] was another.
[1:19:22] And now that pillar of fire begins to
[1:19:26] speak to him.
[1:19:28] Hallelujah.
[1:19:29] It's hard for you to kick against the
[1:19:31] prince.
[1:19:33] And now he could never ever be the same.
[1:19:43] My fear today is too many people only
[1:19:45] know the Bible as a story
[1:19:49] or by Gamil's teachings.
[1:19:52] I'm afraid too many people catch the
[1:19:54] spirit of the pastor
[1:19:57] or the spirit of brother Brandham
[1:19:59] or the spirit of the church
[1:20:02] and it's just a society event. I don't
[1:20:05] want that here.
[1:20:07] I'm just going to be really honest with
[1:20:09] you. My mission,
[1:20:12] my desire is every one of you,
[1:20:18] every one of you, punch your neighbor.
[1:20:21] Every one of you meet this Christ for
[1:20:25] yourself.
[1:20:28] [Applause]
[1:20:42] Brother Dylan that's sitting here. He
[1:20:44] was at the altar last night. I was
[1:20:47] sitting over here and
[1:20:49] the voice spoke to me and said, "You'll
[1:20:51] pray for him tonight."
[1:20:55] Is it okay to tell a story here?
[1:21:00] Dylan in his history,
[1:21:02] even in his wedding, one of his friends
[1:21:04] stood stood here at his wedding.
[1:21:09] You have buddies at your wedding.
[1:21:13] They have passed together.
[1:21:16] But that boy's past was still a part of
[1:21:20] his life. And they were at a party.
[1:21:25] It was the last party.
[1:21:29] He's dead now. He's gone.
[1:21:35] When I heard that,
[1:21:38] I immediately begin to thank God.
[1:21:41] It wasn't Dylan.
[1:21:47] Brother Shannon, because of God,
[1:21:52] that wasn't dealing. Amen.
[1:21:56] Are you with me? And you can look at all
[1:21:59] the whatifs in life and go, "Well, I
[1:22:01] don't know if God watched over, he can
[1:22:03] sit here and say in this building. God
[1:22:06] spared my life.
[1:22:09] When I met Christ, he brought me here.
[1:22:12] He's keeping me."
[1:22:15] That was my lifestyle. That could have
[1:22:17] been me. Amen.
[1:22:22] I worked in nitroglycerin
[1:22:25] for 11 years
[1:22:28] and one night a one of the buildings
[1:22:29] blew up and there was a man named Danny
[1:22:33] that was supposed to be working and he
[1:22:34] said just got sick right before going to
[1:22:38] work.
[1:22:40] Two boys and then got killed that night.
[1:22:42] One of my jobs for months was to look
[1:22:44] for parts of their body so the insurance
[1:22:47] could prove that they were dead. Stupid.
[1:22:54] Danny would come back to work shaken.
[1:22:58] I was sick. I only got sick right before
[1:23:02] and God spared my life. It could have
[1:23:04] been me.
[1:23:06] It could have been me. He gave his heart
[1:23:09] to Christ.
[1:23:12] He said, "God's got a something for me
[1:23:14] in my life." You said, "Brother Ron, but
[1:23:16] I don't have a story like that. I don't
[1:23:18] have a story to where I I, you know, I
[1:23:21] just know that I could have could have
[1:23:23] been dead today." Oh, yeah, you do.
[1:23:26] Right.
[1:23:27] Driving to church this morning.
[1:23:30] That's right.
[1:23:31] You did the most dangerous thing that
[1:23:34] you could do is drive your vehicle.
[1:23:37] Amen.
[1:23:39] And God watched over. Are you with me?
[1:23:43] You've got angels dispatched to watch
[1:23:45] over your life.
[1:23:55] Every one of us has got a story of what
[1:23:57] we could have been and what we could
[1:23:59] have done and what we could have did
[1:24:00] this.
[1:24:02] And all of us has got a story to where
[1:24:04] we feel like we've been harmed or hurt
[1:24:06] or went through a horrible trial.
[1:24:10] One of the greatest testimonies that are
[1:24:12] sitting here is Sister Nancy.
[1:24:15] Sister Nancy as a little bitty girl, her
[1:24:17] family separated.
[1:24:20] You know, it must have been devastating
[1:24:22] to have to leave her mother and they'd
[1:24:24] made choices that none of us want to
[1:24:26] talk about. They had made choices to
[1:24:29] leave. But you see, God planted a
[1:24:32] supernatural seed
[1:24:35] predestination
[1:24:36] on the inside of Nancy Frasier.
[1:24:41] And she couldn't live in Danville all of
[1:24:44] her life. She had to live here.
[1:24:48] She had to be live here. So a wild wild
[1:24:52] human being
[1:24:55] would chase her around the church and
[1:24:57] kiss her on a dare. Listen,
[1:25:03] when that was all going on, she had no
[1:25:07] idea that's that's going to be one of
[1:25:09] the most successful pastors in the
[1:25:12] valley.
[1:25:13] [Music]
[1:25:14] And I'm going to be his queen. But God
[1:25:17] had to arrange her life.
[1:25:23] Sure, there was a lot of hurt. Sure,
[1:25:24] there was a lot of difficulties. All of
[1:25:26] you got them.
[1:25:28] Amen. That's right.
[1:25:30] In your book, all of you've got them.
[1:25:33] But God watched over your predestinated
[1:25:36] seed
[1:25:37] to get you here.
[1:25:39] Let me say, if he can get you here,
[1:25:46] if he can get you here, he'll get you
[1:25:48] there.
[1:26:02] I've never told this,
[1:26:05] ever told it. Never uttered it out of my
[1:26:07] lips, even to Connie.
[1:26:10] They're going, they're going to hear
[1:26:11] this for their first time.
[1:26:14] I was preaching at the old church
[1:26:17] and I'm going to go into a story in just
[1:26:18] a little while, but I rehearsed this
[1:26:21] story of the armor and company
[1:26:25] son.
[1:26:29] And during that part of the
[1:26:32] sermon,
[1:26:33] I begin to talk about Isaac and Rebecca.
[1:26:38] And Eaher
[1:26:40] talking to Rebecca on their journey back
[1:26:43] to Isaac.
[1:26:45] The angel had helped her to have the the
[1:26:49] impact to water that those animals.
[1:26:54] She don't know Isaac. She's never seen
[1:26:56] him. But something is inspired on the
[1:27:00] inside of her and she leaves her father
[1:27:02] and her mother and she leaves the the
[1:27:05] family
[1:27:07] and they get all kind of gifts. But
[1:27:09] Elohazer, there's something in his
[1:27:11] voice.
[1:27:14] There's something in his voice that she
[1:27:16] knows this is real.
[1:27:19] This is real. And she climbs on those
[1:27:22] camels and makes a ride back.
[1:27:26] And she began to ask him, "What's he
[1:27:28] look like?
[1:27:30] What does he like? What does he enjoy?
[1:27:34] How does he want me to dress?"
[1:27:37] And I begin to preach that night on God
[1:27:40] sent us a messenger.
[1:27:43] To let us know what Jesus looks like.
[1:27:47] To let us know what he wants us to dress
[1:27:49] like and how he wants us to live and how
[1:27:52] he wants us to be.
[1:27:55] It's more than a historical book.
[1:28:02] And I noticed Christine began to respond
[1:28:04] as the preaching went forward.
[1:28:07] They would set that night about where
[1:28:09] you're sitting now, Sister Hannah. They
[1:28:12] were sitting there. Her and Jean was
[1:28:13] sitting sitting there.
[1:28:22] And so
[1:28:25] after a couple of days
[1:28:30] I had a chance with her in a very quiet
[1:28:32] moment just me and her.
[1:28:36] Sister Nancy, this might bring her much
[1:28:38] much help.
[1:28:42] She said, "Last night,
[1:28:48] I caught it.
[1:28:52] I caught it.
[1:28:54] What you're preaching is the truth."
[1:28:59] And she said,
[1:29:01] "I believe it with all my heart."
[1:29:09] Amen.
[1:29:12] Listen,
[1:29:14] from that point on, from that point on,
[1:29:18] when I had a private moment with
[1:29:20] Christine,
[1:29:22] she said, "You know, I'm a believer."
[1:29:27] Amen.
[1:29:29] You know, I'm a believer.
[1:29:32] Let me just say this to you saints. That
[1:29:35] means more than houses and land. Amen.
[1:29:40] And I held that so deep in my heart.
[1:29:45] I held it so deep. I would never tell it
[1:29:49] till just today.
[1:29:51] Without a doubt. I'll see her.
[1:29:56] [Applause]
[1:30:20] I'm sorry.
[1:30:24] Brother Brandham said this.
[1:30:26] He said, 'If we should take a trip
[1:30:28] tonight
[1:30:30] and go into heaven.
[1:30:33] And I'd meet Father Abraham and I'd say,
[1:30:35] 'Abraham,
[1:30:38] what is the most glorious thing that you
[1:30:40] have ever known?
[1:30:42] What is the most essential thing
[1:30:45] that you've ever known? That's quite a
[1:30:47] question.
[1:30:51] Abraham would say,
[1:30:54] "Life
[1:30:55] eternal."
[1:30:59] I take a trip and we'll go again and we
[1:31:02] go over to the great Archangel Gabriel
[1:31:05] who is the messenger of the covenant to
[1:31:08] the Jewish people
[1:31:10] and he stands at the right of right hand
[1:31:12] of God, one of the highest order of
[1:31:14] angels in heaven. And I would say to
[1:31:18] him, Gabriel,
[1:31:21] thou art a mighty angel.
[1:31:25] You are loved of God, and you've been
[1:31:28] here for eons of time, and you perhaps
[1:31:34] know everything in the heavens,
[1:31:37] where everything is placed,
[1:31:40] because you're of one of God's right-and
[1:31:44] angels.
[1:31:46] and you know the great secrets of
[1:31:48] heaven.
[1:31:51] You sounded the trumpet of the coming of
[1:31:53] the Lord Jesus.
[1:31:55] You announced his first coming
[1:31:58] and you shall announce the second coming
[1:32:01] and you must be a mighty man or a mighty
[1:32:04] angel. I want to ask you
[1:32:07] in all of God's treasures,
[1:32:12] which is the greatest thing that you
[1:32:14] have found among his treasures?
[1:32:17] And I can see Gabriel bring himself to
[1:32:20] attention and say, "The greatest thing
[1:32:23] that I have found in God's treasures
[1:32:27] since he created me is life."
[1:32:34] God made me to live for eternal
[1:32:40] for eternity.
[1:32:42] Life
[1:32:44] is the greatest thing that there is.
[1:32:49] Amen.
[1:32:51] I want that to sink in.
[1:32:56] After five years in this journey
[1:32:59] fighting for life,
[1:33:03] it's worth fighting for.
[1:33:06] Amen.
[1:33:10] Is this mic working?
[1:33:16] We got cancer patients sitting all
[1:33:18] across this building.
[1:33:20] Sister Wanda,
[1:33:22] I know you've been sick this week.
[1:33:25] But it's worth fighting for.
[1:33:30] Brother Jeff, you're sitting in the back
[1:33:32] of the building and I don't care what
[1:33:34] the doctors say.
[1:33:36] Come on.
[1:33:39] It's worth fighting for.
[1:33:42] Sister Teresa, the things that you're
[1:33:44] going through,
[1:33:46] life is worth fighting for.
[1:33:50] Brother Ron, but you you take chemo.
[1:33:52] Listen, it gives me lease on life,
[1:33:57] but brother, it makes you sick.
[1:34:01] It's worth fighting for.
[1:34:06] Listen, it's worth fighting for.
[1:34:11] Every morning this week, I regurgitated,
[1:34:15] throw it up. I hate to do it. I hate it.
[1:34:19] I'm 5 years down the road and still
[1:34:21] going through those things. Shake it
[1:34:24] off. Maybe an hour later begin to feel
[1:34:26] like myself. But I want to say this to
[1:34:28] you. When my babies come running up and
[1:34:30] hug me,
[1:34:34] when my boys hug me and my little girl
[1:34:36] hugs me, my my beautiful queen hugs me.
[1:34:40] It's worth fighting for.
[1:34:54] And maybe you go through things just to
[1:34:56] come to church and people laugh and you
[1:34:58] scoff at it. Don't let their thoughts
[1:35:02] and their opinions.
[1:35:05] Eternal life is worth fighting for.
[1:35:13] It's worth it.
[1:35:15] It's worth it.
[1:35:24] Brother Ron, you don't know what I'm
[1:35:25] going through. Get past your pity party.
[1:35:29] Get past your nonsense. This is worth
[1:35:32] fighting for.
[1:35:40] Maybe in different countries you won't
[1:35:42] know what I'm really talking about, but
[1:35:43] our freedom today come at great cost.
[1:35:45] That's right.
[1:35:47] Across the mountain here in Co Pepper,
[1:35:49] Virginia. Some of you from that area.
[1:35:55] There's a man, preacher,
[1:35:57] standing in stocks.
[1:36:00] His head, his hands through the stocks.
[1:36:03] They left them there to die.
[1:36:06] So in just standing there instead of
[1:36:07] agony
[1:36:09] and pity party he preached
[1:36:14] and he preached against the church of
[1:36:16] England
[1:36:18] and he wouldn't preach what they was
[1:36:19] demanding him to preach
[1:36:22] and they were going to put him to death
[1:36:24] and he stood in those stocks until his
[1:36:26] death and preached this sermon. Give me
[1:36:29] liberty or give me death.
[1:36:34] Amen.
[1:36:36] And one of the men that rode through and
[1:36:38] heard him was a man on a horse.
[1:36:42] His name was Patrick Henry.
[1:36:45] And he sat on his horse and listened to
[1:36:48] that man preach a sermon on give me
[1:36:52] liberty or give me death.
[1:36:56] He went back to his constituents, his
[1:36:59] peers, and stood up before much enemy.
[1:37:03] Come on.
[1:37:04] and scream to them, "Give us liberty."
[1:37:08] That's right.
[1:37:09] Or give us death.
[1:37:12] That sermon from that preacher
[1:37:16] is one of the reasons we're a free
[1:37:20] nation today.
[1:37:22] [Music]
[1:37:23] [Applause]
[1:37:35] Brother Brown said, "I'm so glad a man
[1:37:37] can so completely serve God
[1:37:40] till the devil don't know what to do
[1:37:42] with him."
[1:37:49] I'm not a preacher, brother. Don't
[1:37:50] matter.
[1:37:52] Some of you sh sisters shake the world.
[1:37:55] Amen.
[1:37:56] You shake the world with your dress. You
[1:37:59] shake the world with your atmosphere.
[1:38:02] You are living in Leoa and Leoa has not
[1:38:05] contaminated you.
[1:38:08] You carry a purity that the world cannot
[1:38:10] create.
[1:38:15] Amen.
[1:38:18] I watched Sister Gabrielle sing last
[1:38:20] night and I thought it's like an angel
[1:38:23] on the earth
[1:38:24] standing there singing. Thank you.
[1:38:28] I listened to Sam sing with Sister
[1:38:31] Melissa today, his mom. And for those
[1:38:33] that don't know, he's a young man that
[1:38:36] liver went bad
[1:38:38] and he had to have another liver. He was
[1:38:40] on his way to being quite a sports star.
[1:38:44] Sometimes God's got different plans.
[1:38:48] He was super successful. He was on his
[1:38:50] way. You know, it was just in his DNA.
[1:38:55] We got a fell here. You mind?
[1:38:59] We got a fella here. We talk about
[1:39:00] sports star. This guy, he'll never tell
[1:39:03] you, but I'll tell you.
[1:39:06] This guy was on his way. He could have
[1:39:10] been a pro. He was on his way as a
[1:39:13] left-handed quarterback his size. He was
[1:39:17] on his way setting state records,
[1:39:20] colleges, making all kind of offers for
[1:39:22] him to come. Amen.
[1:39:25] And be on their be on their teams. But
[1:39:27] God had another plan.
[1:39:31] God had another plan. Listen, God knows
[1:39:35] what he's doing.
[1:39:41] [Applause]
[1:39:43] Sam was on his way
[1:39:46] through all the turmoil of life, through
[1:39:49] all the transplants and the
[1:39:51] difficulties.
[1:39:53] My prayer was, "God, you got a plan."
[1:39:58] And it wasn't the whatifs and hope he
[1:40:00] make it. I want to say this, you I never
[1:40:02] looked at it hoping he made it. I knew
[1:40:05] God bring him through it.
[1:40:07] God, you got a plan.
[1:40:09] [Applause]
[1:40:14] I met his wife for the first time
[1:40:20] as his girlfriend.
[1:40:24] suffering from a condition of no.
[1:40:28] I think she's one of the most beautiful
[1:40:29] human beings alive.
[1:40:33] But she had prayed, "Will will I find
[1:40:36] somebody that loves me?" She couldn't
[1:40:38] have asked for a better candidate.
[1:40:43] What you watch this morning, Sister
[1:40:44] Melissa's story is more than a story.
[1:40:48] [Applause]
[1:40:59] Brother Ron, but what about grace? Look
[1:41:01] at it.
[1:41:02] Look at grace. Look at mercy.
[1:41:06] Look at God taking the pawn shop and
[1:41:08] reaches down and will not let the devil
[1:41:10] destroy our lives. You talking about a
[1:41:13] great God. This is more than a story.
[1:41:32] No doubt Satan hates it.
[1:41:35] No doubt he'd like to destroy it and
[1:41:36] gives you problems every day. But let me
[1:41:38] just say what God's done for you in your
[1:41:41] lives,
[1:41:42] we ought to shout every day.
[1:41:44] [Applause]
[1:41:59] We can talk of Joseph.
[1:42:03] We can talk of Ruth and Boaz.
[1:42:06] We can talk of Samson.
[1:42:19] I'd like to just share for the next few
[1:42:21] minutes something that's real to my
[1:42:23] heart.
[1:42:28] Brother Brandham,
[1:42:30] right in the middle of his phenomenal
[1:42:34] preaching tells a story.
[1:42:39] It was a story that Dwight Moody told.
[1:42:44] It was a setting in the the West to
[1:42:48] where that
[1:42:50] a man from the Armory Company son was
[1:42:53] looking for a wife.
[1:42:56] And I'm going to tell it like it's never
[1:42:58] been told to you before. I want you to
[1:43:00] just do that. You brother on I've heard
[1:43:02] this story. Well, if you're just running
[1:43:04] through the Bible and running through
[1:43:05] these stories and not getting it, I want
[1:43:08] to I want to just tell it one more time
[1:43:10] and maybe you get it today.
[1:43:14] And so
[1:43:19] this girl had been orphaned
[1:43:22] and her uncle took her in. She had a lot
[1:43:25] of daughters.
[1:43:27] He had a lot of daughters.
[1:43:30] And when he took her in, she just being
[1:43:34] almost was like a slave.
[1:43:37] And
[1:43:39] to me, this is more real than
[1:43:40] Cinderella.
[1:43:43] And and she became like a slave. She
[1:43:45] would cook their meals. She cleaned
[1:43:48] their house.
[1:43:50] Listen,
[1:43:53] Mother Shannon, I I I just say this to
[1:43:55] you. probably in her mind she thought,
[1:43:59] "I have no future."
[1:44:02] This is what life's going to be like.
[1:44:07] Little did she know she is going to her
[1:44:10] story is going to be told around the
[1:44:13] world
[1:44:14] over and over again. And she's going to
[1:44:18] type
[1:44:20] Mrs. Jesus Christ.
[1:44:26] No doubt she gets fatigued.
[1:44:29] She gets wore out. She gets frazzled.
[1:44:36] English language don't have enough words
[1:44:37] to say it right here.
[1:44:40] But she feels like she's got no future
[1:44:42] whatsoever.
[1:44:45] But she doesn't know in another realm
[1:44:48] God's got plans.
[1:44:55] and the armoring company, the man that
[1:44:59] owns it all,
[1:45:02] his son needs a wife.
[1:45:04] Now in Chicago, there's a lot of women
[1:45:07] there,
[1:45:09] parties,
[1:45:11] doll babies,
[1:45:13] put ons,
[1:45:14] but he don't want that. He wants
[1:45:16] something real. Amen.
[1:45:18] Amen.
[1:45:19] So, he takes a journey to this ranch
[1:45:24] and they hear he's coming and they put
[1:45:26] on parties and they put on their best
[1:45:28] dresses and they get their best singers
[1:45:30] and they get everything set up and he
[1:45:33] goes there and they put their best on
[1:45:36] for him
[1:45:38] and he immediately begins to see this is
[1:45:42] all I saw in Chicago.
[1:45:45] Let me just say something to you.
[1:45:48] Even a child can see what's artificial.
[1:45:53] A child can see artificial, but they can
[1:45:56] also see real.
[1:46:05] She's not put in a beautiful dress.
[1:46:11] She's working in the kitchen.
[1:46:17] She doesn't have shoes on.
[1:46:20] She's worse the dishes.
[1:46:22] Today it was probably a hundred dishes.
[1:46:26] She's got wash water.
[1:46:29] She takes it out. There's a corral out
[1:46:32] behind the house and she takes it out.
[1:46:37] She's probably did this thousand times,
[1:46:39] Brother Stephen.
[1:46:43] and she takes her dish water and she
[1:46:44] carries it out and she throws it out.
[1:46:48] But she today she don't realize she's
[1:46:51] got company.
[1:46:54] You know there's sometimes you don't
[1:46:55] realize that you got company.
[1:46:58] You just don't know who's watching you.
[1:47:04] I don't know. But maybe he cleared his
[1:47:07] throat.
[1:47:09] Maybe just a word or two. How are you?
[1:47:15] and she immediately recognized this is
[1:47:17] him.
[1:47:19] Now, you might meet him in a sagebrush
[1:47:21] field, our Lord Jesus.
[1:47:25] You might see him in a round window.
[1:47:30] It's him. You might feel him as a warm
[1:47:33] sensation coming through your bedroom.
[1:47:36] It's him. You may feel him when you're
[1:47:39] down on your knees and all of a sudden
[1:47:41] it feels like somebody walked in the
[1:47:43] room. It's him.
[1:47:47] And he begins to talk to her and he
[1:47:50] begins to tell her his mission
[1:47:54] is here to get a wife.
[1:47:57] Not a die baby. A wife.
[1:48:00] Come on.
[1:48:01] Not a mannequin. A wife.
[1:48:04] Not somebody that'll look apart. I need
[1:48:06] a wife. That's
[1:48:07] right.
[1:48:08] I need a I need somebody that will
[1:48:10] reflect my character.
[1:48:11] Amen.
[1:48:15] He talks to her long enough until he
[1:48:18] recognizes
[1:48:20] she's the one I'm looking for.
[1:48:23] Amen.
[1:48:26] Every one of you got a story about how
[1:48:28] you met.
[1:48:30] About how you met.
[1:48:37] You might want to hear sister Kristen's
[1:48:39] story with brother Jordan
[1:48:43] and Jordan's mother telling telling him,
[1:48:45] "Don't you miss it. Don't you miss it."
[1:48:49] Well, he didn't miss it.
[1:48:52] Every one of us has got that story.
[1:48:57] Oh, yeah.
[1:48:59] Oh, yeah.
[1:49:01] Oh, yeah. And no matter how old you are,
[1:49:04] that story is Oh yeah.
[1:49:10] Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Are you with me?
[1:49:14] Brother Bram said, "God will cause you
[1:49:16] to step out of eternity into time
[1:49:20] and then he'll bring you together." And
[1:49:22] maybe even others don't realize what's
[1:49:25] going on, but it's you. You catch it.
[1:49:27] That's him.
[1:49:30] That's her,
[1:49:31] brother. I lost that feeling a long time
[1:49:33] ago. You better fall back in love.
[1:49:39] Hey, take a vacation together. Fall back
[1:49:42] in love.
[1:49:45] Somebody help me preach right here.
[1:49:48] Somebody help me preach right here.
[1:49:56] Don't never get over that spark.
[1:50:00] I'm not just talking about you and your
[1:50:02] mate here on earth, but I'm talking
[1:50:03] about you and Jesus.
[1:50:06] Woo!
[1:50:07] I'm talking about you and him.
[1:50:12] It gets better every day. There ain't
[1:50:15] nothing like it.
[1:50:17] [Applause]
[1:50:22] Alvin's the best a man in the building
[1:50:24] right now.
[1:50:25] Going to be a good week.
[1:50:32] He reaches over and kisses her on the
[1:50:34] cheek as a seal for her.
[1:50:39] Now, let me just say this to you.
[1:50:42] Nobody's going to believe her story
[1:50:46] but her. That's important right here.
[1:50:50] Nobody's going to believe your story but
[1:50:53] you.
[1:50:55] They're going to see your atmosphere
[1:50:57] change. They're going to see your life
[1:50:59] change. But they wasn't there when it
[1:51:02] happened.
[1:51:06] And you sing the song, something keeps
[1:51:08] holding me.
[1:51:10] And listen, every time that you sing the
[1:51:12] song, it comes back.
[1:51:15] Amen.
[1:51:21] A year. He makes a promise. A year.
[1:51:27] Brother tells this story, but it's also
[1:51:29] living in us.
[1:51:32] A year from now, I'm going to come back
[1:51:34] and I'm going to get you.
[1:51:37] Now, listen.
[1:51:38] She's like Joseph. She tells us visions
[1:51:42] and they don't believe her. That's
[1:51:43] right. They laugh at her. They make fun
[1:51:46] of her.
[1:51:48] A year she begins to make a dress. A
[1:51:52] year she begins to make preparations.
[1:51:54] A year she begins to work. She keeps
[1:51:57] doing what she's got to do. But listen,
[1:51:59] it ain't the same now.
[1:52:02] There's a there's a light at the end of
[1:52:04] the tunnel.
[1:52:05] Let me tell you, the rapture is our
[1:52:07] light.
[1:52:11] Hallelujah.
[1:52:13] This world is not my home. I'm just a
[1:52:17] passing through.
[1:52:23] Sister Edwards, don't get discouraged.
[1:52:25] We've got a We've got a promise.
[1:52:37] We can all imagine how difficult it was
[1:52:40] for her.
[1:52:44] working on a dress and everybody making
[1:52:46] fun.
[1:52:51] No doubt their complaints got worse and
[1:52:53] worse.
[1:52:54] But there come a season to where
[1:52:57] countdown's going on. You girls is
[1:53:00] getting married, countdown starts. You
[1:53:03] know, when it was a year out,
[1:53:05] you know, it's nice, but when you're
[1:53:07] weeks away, your nerves, listen, the
[1:53:11] guy, he it don't bother him whatsoever.
[1:53:15] He's going to show up in long socks
[1:53:20] and maybe the wrong color shoes for the
[1:53:22] suit that he's got on. Yeah, baby.
[1:53:28] But there's something going on on the
[1:53:30] inside.
[1:53:33] Don't let him die.
[1:53:35] Don't let him die. You right. I'm going
[1:53:38] to get through this.
[1:53:51] But I want you to understand there comes
[1:53:53] a spot called last time.
[1:53:58] Come on now.
[1:54:01] Last time.
[1:54:02] Come on.
[1:54:03] Now, let me explain something to you.
[1:54:07] We're coming to the last time.
[1:54:10] Go ahead.
[1:54:12] We're coming to that spot.
[1:54:13] Come on now.
[1:54:14] It's meaning more to us all the time.
[1:54:18] It It was more than a story.
[1:54:21] Yes, it was.
[1:54:24] But we're coming to the event
[1:54:27] of the last time,
[1:54:29] last day at work,
[1:54:31] [Applause]
[1:54:34] [Music]
[1:54:40] we're coming to the last services.
[1:54:46] Let me just say this to you. I'm going
[1:54:48] to miss quite a bit of my sermon, but I
[1:54:49] want you to understand tonight when you
[1:54:51] come here, you ought to be the most
[1:54:52] excited people on the earth.
[1:54:56] I don't want you to be a bunch of dad
[1:54:58] heads.
[1:55:05] This is our story.
[1:55:08] This is our time.
[1:55:12] We're going home.
[1:55:14] We're going to get a body change.
[1:55:19] This is me in the book.
[1:55:22] This is me.
[1:55:24] It's not Joseph. It's not Abraham. It's
[1:55:26] not It's me. It's me, mama. It's me in
[1:55:31] the mirror. It's me.
[1:55:42] You know,
[1:55:44] you know there's something
[1:55:49] now. Her story is much different than
[1:55:51] those girls.
[1:55:52] That was just a stinking snotty-nosed
[1:55:54] boy that showed up. But her story is
[1:55:57] different.
[1:55:59] Today is the day.
[1:56:03] She probably didn't sleep last night.
[1:56:06] rolled around the bed thinking,
[1:56:09] "This day,
[1:56:12] this day."
[1:56:15] And she put her apron on. And she went
[1:56:18] and started cooking and rolling those
[1:56:20] eggs. Today's the day. I'm cooking eggs.
[1:56:24] Last time.
[1:56:26] Come on.
[1:56:27] Last time.
[1:56:28] And I'm pouring it on their plates. Last
[1:56:31] time. And when they start fussing at
[1:56:33] her, she's going, "Last time."
[1:56:37] [Applause]
[1:56:41] Hallelujah.
[1:56:43] Last time. Last time.
[1:56:52] This morning, I just begin to envision
[1:56:54] it. She took that string off of that
[1:56:57] apron, went
[1:57:01] took it off and she hung it up. She took
[1:57:05] that laid it up on that nail and she
[1:57:09] said, "Last time."
[1:57:13] Hallelujah.
[1:57:14] Hallelujah.
[1:57:18] And I was on a walk this morning and I
[1:57:22] was making my laps on my three-mile walk
[1:57:26] and I turned the corner at Andrew's
[1:57:28] house and I begin to think about hanging
[1:57:31] that apron on the nail.
[1:57:35] And it hit me one of these mornings I'm
[1:57:38] going to take chemo last time.
[1:57:50] Woo!
[1:57:52] Woo!
[1:57:55] Woo!
[1:57:58] Come on, church.
[1:58:00] Your last time is on the way.
[1:58:12] The devil's been boogering you up. Why
[1:58:14] don't you tell him you're coming to your
[1:58:16] last time?
[1:58:18] I want you to know I'm putting up with
[1:58:20] you for your last times. I'm leaving.
[1:58:25] This is more than a story.
[1:58:31] She put her wedding dress on. You can
[1:58:33] stand. Musicians can come.
[1:58:36] She put her wedding dress on the message
[1:58:39] and she put it on
[1:58:42] and it was perfect.
[1:58:46] It was perfect.
[1:58:49] She wasn't wearing somebody else's
[1:58:50] dress.
[1:58:54] She wearing her dress.
[1:58:59] Her dress.
[1:59:01] And it fit just right.
[1:59:06] You married girls, you know what I'm
[1:59:07] talking about. You You put that dress on
[1:59:11] and today's the day and you stand in
[1:59:14] front of that long mirror and you turn
[1:59:16] around and you do that turn. And after a
[1:59:20] little while, you do another one.
[1:59:24] And you do another one
[1:59:28] cuz it's your turn.
[1:59:31] Today's your day.
[1:59:34] No more dishes for that bunch.
[1:59:39] No more putting up with that bunch. No
[1:59:41] more. I'm going to a city whose builder
[1:59:44] makers God.
[1:59:47] I'm going to a place
[1:59:50] I'm going to a place where we're going
[1:59:53] to spend eternity.
[2:00:03] like a man that was a preacher
[2:00:07] was standing just before they cut his
[2:00:09] head off
[2:00:10] [Music]
[2:00:13] and the executioner was standing there
[2:00:16] and he said, "Sir,
[2:00:19] can I give you something?"
[2:00:22] He said, "I've never got a gift standing
[2:00:24] here."
[2:00:27] He said, "Where I'm going, I won't need
[2:00:29] this no more."
[2:00:31] [Music]
[2:00:45] I won't need this no more.
[2:00:48] I want you to take it.
[2:00:52] The executioner
[2:00:55] took that man's watch
[2:00:59] and he wore it the rest of his life
[2:01:02] because he became a Christian and he
[2:01:05] became a preacher.
[2:01:11] That preacher's last sermon
[2:01:14] was just exercising. This is the last
[2:01:17] time I want to watch this.
[2:01:19] And more than a story happened
[2:01:23] when he took his watch off and hand it
[2:01:26] to him.
[2:01:30] [Music]
[2:01:36] You was invited here
[2:01:43] maybe many years ago
[2:01:46] and this became more than a church.
[2:01:51] This became more than a community of
[2:01:53] believers.
[2:01:55] This become life.
[2:02:00] You'd heard about people that were real.
[2:02:06] You'd heard about those real Christians,
[2:02:10] but you didn't know what it was like.
[2:02:12] [Music]
[2:02:14] But then
[2:02:16] the story become real to you.
[2:02:22] It makes a tremendous difference
[2:02:27] between their story
[2:02:29] and your story.
[2:02:34] [Music]
