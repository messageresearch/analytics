[44:59] the younger two grow up and uh had a
[45:02] great time with him and
[45:04] enjoyed playing soccer with with joel in

[45:30] we we certainly appreciated that brother
[45:33] ed
[45:33] and sister sandy we love you with all of
[45:36] our hearts
[45:38] i think it's one of the most incredible
[45:40] compliments that a man can have
[45:42] is when he's been the pastor of a church
[45:45] and
[45:45] there's a legacy that is there like
[45:48] brother harold has been a general
[45:50] through all of these years that a young
[45:52] man
[45:54] actually the same age that i am
[45:57] brother ed has raised up there in the
[45:59] church and
[46:00] been been filling with as a pastor there
[46:04] uh for these numbers of years now and
[46:07] and i'd like to say this to you god
[46:09] doesn't regress he progresses and so
[46:12] he he just he knows exactly how to
[46:14] handle everything and
[46:16] we're a team we're a body of believers
[46:19] we're not a one-man operation we're a

[56:55] knows who he can trust
[56:56] he knows who who will be blessed and he
[56:59] knows what they'll do with it
[57:01] amen and brother aidan is one of the
[57:04] most humble men that i've
[57:06] ever met and one of the most godly men
[57:08] i've ever met
[57:10] how many children do you have brother we

[57:14] grandchildren 19 grandchildren
[57:19] 19 and working
[57:23] amen how many acres is your greenhouse
[57:26] now
[57:27] the greenhouse is five acres
[57:30] it started off with a ten by twenty if
[57:32] that was your question earlier
[57:35] ten foot by twenty and it is now
[57:38] five acres the governor came to your
[57:42] your place too it wasn't necessary it
[57:45] was
[57:46] uh sunny purdue the agriculture
[57:50] guru i'm not sure what you would call
[57:52] him little
[57:54] farm boys like us don't know those terms
[57:56] but
[57:58] he did there was another just below
[58:01] cabinet member that came as well
[58:04] and we were too ignorant and dumb to
[58:06] know all these
[58:09] high-floating people so i guess you'll
[58:11] just have to kind of
[58:12] forgive our wording here but they uh
[58:16] they called a couple days before they
[58:18] came and said now we want to come in
[58:20] there and
[58:20] check you out the day before sunny
[58:24] actually
[58:24] comes and i say well
[58:27] maybe this is a little bit more than
[58:29] what i expected
[58:31] so they came in there three or four guys
[58:34] and
[58:34] checked everything out make sure we
[58:36] weren't gonna do anything funny
[58:39] so the next day they came in with their
[58:42] crew and there was
[58:43] i'm kind of guessing a little bit but
[58:45] between three and four dozen people with
[58:47] the media
[58:48] and the protectors and everybody else
[58:51] that was there
[58:53] so it was pretty amazing to us
[58:57] so he was sharing with me with this last
[58:58] night he says
[59:00] you know we get everything ready under
[59:02] this five acres of
[59:03] greenhouse and he said then
[59:07] he said the day before we open nobody's
[59:09] there
[59:12] and they have nine cash registers and i
[59:14] can catch them
[59:15] they have nine cash registers
[59:18] thank you the fields are full of cars
[59:25] it's amazing we're talking about
[59:29] hundreds and hundreds
[59:31] and even they have food trucks actually
[59:34] come out
[59:35] to be able to feed the people that comes
[59:40] and and god just continues to let it
[59:44] grow
[59:45] and be blessed by it amen that's right
[59:48] and it's all god it's all god absolutely
[59:51] and those hands
[59:52] and those that pray for us
[1:00:12] i think it's absolutely interesting that
[1:00:15] that we're on the subject of an
[1:00:16] unlimited god
[1:00:22] i didn't know brother aidan and sister
[1:00:24] mary were coming
[1:00:25] he has something on his heart that he is
[1:00:28] praying about and so
[1:00:30] amen we're we're just thankful that we
[1:00:33] can be a part of his life and
[1:00:36] and uh thank you for being here
[1:00:39] amen we love you with all of our hearts
[1:00:41] and
[1:00:42] amen i believe those miracles need to be
[1:00:45] shared
[1:00:47] or we're living in real supernatural
[1:00:49] times and
[1:00:50] you know if god can do that he can
[1:00:53] perform a resurrection
[1:00:57] and we're reminded that 14 years ago
[1:01:02] this man that's preaching to you this
[1:01:04] morning was brain dead
[1:01:07] and and they were going to harvest my
[1:01:09] organs in hours
[1:01:11] and i woke up because i needed to preach
[1:01:14] to you this morning
[1:01:16] amen amen and that didn't happen in a
[1:01:19] backwoods hospital
[1:01:20] that happened at uva and so dr
[1:01:24] buck walter said these miracles are the
[1:01:26] most documented miracles they can be
[1:01:28] and so we're just thankful for what he's
[1:01:30] doing
[1:01:31] and we're reminded that cancer is not
[1:01:34] big enough
[1:01:35] to to whip my god and so
[1:01:39] amen amen god bless you this morning and
[1:01:42] god bless you in edmonton
[1:01:44] we will do our best and uh we just have
[1:01:47] some things on our heart that god has
[1:01:48] spoken to us about
[1:01:50] thankful for last night's service that
[1:01:52] to me i've heard i've heard
[1:01:54] i'm not degrading anybody but i've heard
[1:01:56] a lot of people
[1:01:57] attempt to speak on a phoenix but last
[1:02:00] night i believe was one of the greatest
[1:02:02] greatest masterpieces i've heard on that
[1:02:05] if you haven't heard it go back and
[1:02:06] listen to it
[1:02:08] rising from the ashes and if we all look
[1:02:10] at our lives
[1:02:11] we're a part of that and amen if you
[1:02:14] just look how the
[1:02:15] burnover of our lives is god comes down
[1:02:18] and takes the old man
[1:02:20] makes a new man out of him and amen we
[1:02:23] all are can testify of his
[1:02:25] mercy and his grace and his love and
[1:02:27] he's still in the saving business
[1:02:30] and he's still in the healing business
[1:02:32] and he's still in the given the holy
[1:02:34] ghost business and so
[1:02:36] amen let's stand to our feet this
[1:02:38] morning and amen
[1:02:40] thank you for your patience with us and
[1:02:43] and uh
[1:02:44] you know i realize i realize in a
[1:02:46] convention services sometimes we get a
[1:02:48] little bit longer
[1:02:49] and you just be patient with us and
[1:02:51] enjoy this you didn't have to fly
[1:02:53] 16 hours to do it so you're here god
[1:02:56] bless you for being here
[1:02:58] and you pull on the word and god will
[1:03:00] help us all here this morning
[1:03:02] i'd like for us to turn this morning to
[1:03:04] genesis chapter
[1:03:06] 13 and verse 14.
[1:03:09] and i'd like to look on an unlimited god
[1:03:12] and
[1:03:12] and i'd like to give it a title to as
[1:03:14] well from the lamb's book
[1:03:17] we have a purpose to overcome
[1:03:21] amen our purpose is to overcome
[1:03:26] genesis chapter 13 and verse 14 these
[1:03:29] scriptures are for background
[1:03:31] and the lord said unto abraham after
[1:03:34] that lot was separated from him
[1:03:38] lift up now thine eyes and look from the
[1:03:41] place
[1:03:42] where thou art northward southward
[1:03:46] eastward and westward for
[1:03:49] all the land which thou seest
[1:03:52] to give will i give it thee
[1:03:56] to thee will i give it
[1:03:59] and to thy seed forever
[1:04:03] and i will make thy seed as the dust
[1:04:06] of the earth so that if a man can
[1:04:10] number the dust of the earth
[1:04:13] then shall thy seed also be numbered
[1:04:17] remember god's speaking to a man that
[1:04:19] doesn't have any children and it's
[1:04:21] impossible for them to have children
[1:04:23] and god's giving him a promise
[1:04:27] chapter 15 in verse 1. and after these
[1:04:30] things the word of the lord came unto
[1:04:32] abram in a vision saying fear not
[1:04:35] abram i am thy shield and thy exceeding
[1:04:37] great reward
[1:04:39] and abram said lord god what will thou
[1:04:42] give me seeing that i go childless
[1:04:44] and the steward of my house is eliza of
[1:04:47] damascus
[1:04:48] and abraham said behold to me thou has
[1:04:51] given no seed
[1:04:53] and lo one born in my house is mine heir
[1:04:56] and behold the word of the lord came now
[1:04:59] listen not the word of his friend the
[1:05:01] word of the lord
[1:05:03] came unto him saying this shall not be
[1:05:06] thine
[1:05:06] error but he shall come forth out of
[1:05:10] thine own bowel shall be thine air
[1:05:12] and he brought forth abroad and said
[1:05:16] look now toward heaven and tell the
[1:05:19] stars
[1:05:20] if thou be able to number them and he
[1:05:23] said unto him
[1:05:25] so shall thy seed be so counting sand
[1:05:29] and
[1:05:29] counting stalls we realize the stars is
[1:05:32] the first
[1:05:34] bible in heaven and he believed in the
[1:05:37] lord and he counted it to him for
[1:05:39] righteousness
[1:05:40] and he said unto him i am the lord that
[1:05:43] brought thee
[1:05:44] out of ur of the chaldeans to give thee
[1:05:46] this land to inherit
[1:05:48] amen genesis chapter 22 and verse 14
[1:05:53] and abraham called the name of the place
[1:05:55] jehovah jireh
[1:05:57] as it is said to this day in the mount
[1:05:59] of the lord it shall be seen
[1:06:01] and the angel the lord called unto
[1:06:03] abraham out of heaven the second time
[1:06:06] notice these words now and said
[1:06:09] by myself have
[1:06:12] i sworn you've got to swear to the
[1:06:16] greater
[1:06:17] and remember there is no greater than
[1:06:19] god so he swore to himself
[1:06:23] saith the lord for because thou hast
[1:06:25] done this thing
[1:06:26] and hath not withheld by his own only
[1:06:29] son
[1:06:30] that in blessing i will bless thee
[1:06:34] and in multiplying i will multiply
[1:06:37] thy seed as the stars of the heaven and
[1:06:40] as the sand which is upon the seashore
[1:06:43] and thy seed shall possess the gates of
[1:06:46] his enemy and in thy seed shall
[1:06:50] all nations of the earth be blessed
[1:06:53] because
[1:06:54] thou has so be obeyed
[1:06:58] my voice may you you can be seated may
[1:07:02] the lord
[1:07:02] add the blessing to the word amen
[1:07:06] brother andrew sent me this this this
[1:07:08] morning and i want to just share it with
[1:07:09] you if you can
[1:07:12] god knew who abraham was
[1:07:16] but god challenged his faith
[1:07:20] so that abraham could know who abraham
[1:07:24] was
[1:07:26] did you catch that god knew who abraham
[1:07:29] was
[1:07:30] but god challenged his faith
[1:07:33] so that abraham could know who abraham
[1:07:36] was
[1:07:38] now you realize i'm not just going to
[1:07:39] preach on abraham this morning we're
[1:07:41] going to we're going to get to your
[1:07:42] house
[1:07:44] now i want to just share something with
[1:07:46] you as i just read
[1:07:47] dust to stars and count the
[1:07:50] sand i
[1:07:53] was i was at brother kelly hildebrandt's
[1:07:56] and
[1:07:57] i saw this coin and i really very much
[1:08:00] liked this coin because it was a
[1:08:02] it meant something to me and
[1:08:06] uh it has a it has a pebble of sand
[1:08:10] in it and it's a special coin it's a
[1:08:14] d-day coin and it's commemoration of the
[1:08:18] world war
[1:08:18] ii d-day and it was operation
[1:08:21] overlord and
[1:08:25] i liked it of course it was a it was a
[1:08:27] limited edition and
[1:08:29] no way i could get my hands on it but
[1:08:32] i'd invited brother kelly to come here
[1:08:34] last last uh november before before the
[1:08:38] cancer struck
[1:08:40] and brother kelly would generally come
[1:08:42] in the day before
[1:08:44] of the meeting brother kelly flew to
[1:08:47] from saskatoon to calgary
[1:08:50] and the plane was delayed and then it
[1:08:52] was he
[1:08:53] canceled and he couldn't come then the
[1:08:56] next day he flew to toronto
[1:08:59] uh then he was was told there that the
[1:09:03] planes were canceled
[1:09:04] and he wouldn't be able to be here so
[1:09:07] saturday night comes and i speak and
[1:09:10] i take brother kelly's place and and i
[1:09:13] speak a sermon god had spoke to me
[1:09:15] don't worry that has been a resounding
[1:09:19] sermon that's been
[1:09:20] in my heart don't worry this was before
[1:09:23] anything the any diagnosis that was
[1:09:25] going to take place
[1:09:27] and and so anyway
[1:09:30] brother kelly was not going to get here
[1:09:33] on sunday
[1:09:34] morning to be able to speak so right in
[1:09:37] midway of saturday night service
[1:09:39] i just said well instead of having
[1:09:41] sunday morning we'll have sunday night
[1:09:43] and so and so brother kelly arrived and
[1:09:47] remember i remember the words i said
[1:09:49] satan is trying to block
[1:09:51] the visitation of the message that he is
[1:09:55] to deliver
[1:09:56] sometimes we come to church and we think
[1:09:58] well that's just a man
[1:10:00] speaking but if it's a man is has a holy
[1:10:03] ghost
[1:10:04] ministry in his life it's more than a
[1:10:06] man speaking
[1:10:07] he's speaking as an oracle of god and
[1:10:10] the word is a discerner of the thoughts
[1:10:12] and the intents of the heart
[1:10:14] and so it literally it becomes personal
[1:10:17] to every person in the building
[1:10:20] brother kelly would come on sunday
[1:10:22] afternoon and
[1:10:23] and brother kelly would as he stepped to
[1:10:26] the pulpit
[1:10:27] i didn't know anything as he stepped to
[1:10:29] the pulpit
[1:10:31] he he says i've got a special present
[1:10:34] for brother ron
[1:10:37] and it's this coin and that night he
[1:10:40] preached a sermon from this coin and
[1:10:42] this coin is
[1:10:44] saying operation overlord
[1:10:49] it's a d-day with a piece of sand in it
[1:10:51] it's going to mean more to you in just a
[1:10:53] moment
[1:10:55] and it's a it's an eisenhower statement
[1:10:59] that says
[1:11:01] we will accept nothing less than
[1:11:04] full victory
[1:11:09] so i take this very personal
[1:11:15] cancer stole a lot of things away from
[1:11:17] me
[1:11:20] but i'm going to take back everything
[1:11:23] that it stole away from me not me
[1:11:26] but god is going to take back everything
[1:11:30] that it stole away and we will accept
[1:11:33] nothing
[1:11:34] less than full victory
[1:11:47] this piece of ground with sand
[1:11:52] that was a man from this church
[1:11:56] that ran the beach at normandy
[1:12:00] he ran that beach and he said when i
[1:12:02] when i left the boat
[1:12:05] he said friends begin the comrades begin
[1:12:07] to die around me
[1:12:10] and he said the water turned red and he
[1:12:13] said i couldn't understand why i lived
[1:12:17] he said as i got on the sand he said he
[1:12:20] shut
[1:12:20] hundreds of lives were perishing in
[1:12:23] seconds
[1:12:24] from those big guns and he said all i
[1:12:27] knew to do was keep
[1:12:28] running and he said i made it through
[1:12:32] the water i made it through the sand
[1:12:35] i made it to the wall and he said i
[1:12:38] asked myself
[1:12:40] how did i get him
[1:12:43] and it would be many decades later that
[1:12:45] he would be sitting in this church
[1:12:47] and he would be sitting about where you
[1:12:49] are brother roger and he would be
[1:12:51] sitting there and he heard a sermon on
[1:12:52] predestination
[1:12:53] how god watches over you and watches
[1:12:56] over your life and he protects you
[1:12:58] and your life is orchestrated and driven
[1:13:01] by god
[1:13:02] and he said i realized when i ran that i
[1:13:05] ran that run that day and i always
[1:13:08] questioned in my life why did i live and
[1:13:12] all those
[1:13:12] others didn't live he said i realized
[1:13:15] that i had protection
[1:13:17] with god
[1:13:18] [Music]
[1:13:21] so that one piece of sand means
[1:13:24] incredible
[1:13:25] amount to us
[1:13:31] there's another little article i've got
[1:13:33] many more i'd like to share a couple of
[1:13:34] more next maybe next week but
[1:13:39] a brother jackson
[1:13:42] in in texas he sent me
[1:13:46] a a badge that i could wear
[1:13:49] and it's a honey badgers badge
[1:13:54] because my boys call me a honey badger
[1:13:58] and it says fear no evil
[1:14:01] now you know the statement about a honey
[1:14:03] badger
[1:14:04] they're cute but they're dangerous
[1:14:08] i'm not calling myself cute this morning
[1:14:13] amen hallelujah amen
[1:14:17] but i'm a grain of sand what abraham was
[1:14:21] looking across
[1:14:22] i'm one of those grains
[1:14:24] [Music]
[1:14:25] one of those stars that abraham was
[1:14:27] looking at i'm one of those stars
[1:14:30] and like abraham had to go through all
[1:14:33] of those trials to recognize who abraham
[1:14:35] was
[1:14:36] you're going to have some trials of life
[1:14:40] remember this eternal life you
[1:14:43] always was you have eternal life
[1:14:47] and there's only one form of it and
[1:14:49] that's god you were his
[1:14:51] attribute and he thought of you
[1:14:54] and knowed you before the foundation of
[1:14:57] the world
[1:14:58] you were in the lamb's book
[1:15:03] maybe you couldn't see yourself there
[1:15:06] but you was there
[1:15:09] was looking at the picture of brother
[1:15:12] harold and
[1:15:13] sister leanne and their children this
[1:15:15] week
[1:15:16] and i remember the vision of of sister
[1:15:18] leanne being brother harold's wife and
[1:15:21] and i i remember that and so
[1:15:25] you know i could only see that far
[1:15:29] and so that's all he allowed me to see
[1:15:31] but you see
[1:15:32] glock saw further than harold
[1:15:35] and leanne he saw melody and joel
[1:15:41] and he sees past your children and your
[1:15:43] grandchildren
[1:15:44] he's been doing this since before the
[1:15:46] foundation of the world
[1:15:49] hallelujah are you with me now remember
[1:15:52] the statement i came from god
[1:15:54] and i'm going back to god
[1:15:57] amen the scripture says in romans 4
[1:16:01] therefore it is of faith that it might
[1:16:03] be
[1:16:03] by grace to the end of the promise be
[1:16:06] sure to all the city not to only that
[1:16:09] which is of the law but that which is of
[1:16:11] the faith of abraham
[1:16:13] who is the father of us all as it is
[1:16:16] written i have made the father many
[1:16:18] nations
[1:16:19] before him whom he believed even
[1:16:22] god who quickeneth the dead and calleth
[1:16:25] those things which be
[1:16:27] as though they were and he said who
[1:16:30] against hope
[1:16:31] you ever come to a dead end who against
[1:16:34] hope
[1:16:36] believed in hope that he might become
[1:16:39] the father of many nations
[1:16:41] according to that which was spoken so
[1:16:44] shall thy seek be
[1:16:45] and be not weak in faith he considered
[1:16:48] not his own body
[1:16:49] now dead when he was about a hundred
[1:16:53] years old
[1:16:54] neither the deadness of sarah's womb
[1:16:56] notice these next words
[1:16:58] he staggered not at the promise of god
[1:17:02] [Music]
[1:17:03] through unbelief but was strong in faith
[1:17:07] giving glory to god and being fully
[1:17:10] persuaded
[1:17:11] that what he had promised
[1:17:16] he was able also to perform
[1:17:20] i want you to notice there's not a
[1:17:22] promise in the scriptures
[1:17:24] that god can't fulfill
[1:17:28] amen your amens ought to have been
[1:17:29] better than that there's not a promise
[1:17:31] in the scripture
[1:17:34] that god's not able to fulfill
[1:17:41] now sure you're going to have some night
[1:17:42] seasons in your life
[1:17:44] the book of life is going to talk about
[1:17:47] many things that you'll go through
[1:17:49] let me just give you a few examples
[1:17:52] sarah
[1:17:52] that we're talking about even now
[1:17:55] endured
[1:17:56] 90 years of the frustrating humiliation
[1:18:01] of barrenness but god had a promise for
[1:18:05] her
[1:18:06] job that the book of job it tells us of
[1:18:10] all the tragedy
[1:18:11] the horror because god and satan had a
[1:18:14] meeting
[1:18:17] and god was the one that raised it up
[1:18:19] have you considered my servant job
[1:18:22] because satan said i've been running to
[1:18:24] and fro in the earth seeking whom i may
[1:18:27] devour
[1:18:28] remember satan's job is to kill to steal
[1:18:31] and destroy
[1:18:32] so listen don't get on his team
[1:18:37] you may have pleasure in this life and
[1:18:39] sin in this life
[1:18:40] sin is pleasurable for a season
[1:18:44] it is pleasurable the scripture says
[1:18:46] it's pleasurable for a season
[1:18:48] you can make it your god and for your
[1:18:50] flesh you'll find it pleasurable
[1:18:54] but the end is death separation from god
[1:18:59] job is there he's rich
[1:19:02] he has many children his family is
[1:19:06] blessed
[1:19:06] people of the earth come to see him and
[1:19:08] counsel with him
[1:19:10] and one by one trials begin to come and
[1:19:13] he winds up on the ash heap
[1:19:15] scratching his balls
[1:19:18] god came to him god came to him
[1:19:23] and he got a revelation that he would
[1:19:25] see
[1:19:26] god and god didn't come down and talk to
[1:19:29] him and have a pity party with him and
[1:19:31] ask him about his trials and ask him
[1:19:33] about his turmoils and
[1:19:35] ask him about the situation of the life
[1:19:37] god talked to him about
[1:19:39] eternal things and he says where was you
[1:19:42] job
[1:19:42] when i laid the foundations of the earth
[1:19:46] so in the midst of the darkness of your
[1:19:49] trial
[1:19:51] in the midst of the darkness of your
[1:19:53] trial are you with me now
[1:19:55] satan may take your life that you'll
[1:19:57] step into eternal life
[1:19:58] [Applause]
[1:20:01] a lot of times we have grief here but i
[1:20:03] want you to understand for a christian
[1:20:06] death is a friend it's only a doorway we
[1:20:09] step
[1:20:10] through it's our it's our little uber
[1:20:12] driver that gets us over to that realm
[1:20:16] hallelujah where we're promised a
[1:20:19] resurrection
[1:20:20] we'll never sorrow we'll never make
[1:20:23] we'll never have a situation that we
[1:20:25] have to have crisis in
[1:20:26] ever again cancer will never have a hold
[1:20:30] of that body
[1:20:34] where was you and i laid the foundations
[1:20:36] of the earth
[1:20:42] isaac endured darkness of blindness
[1:20:48] and it would be the will of god
[1:20:52] because he would have two sons and god
[1:20:54] would say
[1:20:55] now jacob will love him
[1:20:59] but esau i hate him
[1:21:04] that ought to give us confidence and
[1:21:05] grace by you're saying here today that
[1:21:07] god loves you
[1:21:09] that's not saying that god don't love
[1:21:10] those people out there in the world
[1:21:13] god loves the whole world but you make
[1:21:14] decisions that send you where you are
[1:21:16] i want you to understand today god don't
[1:21:19] send you to hell
[1:21:21] he makes a way of provision for you
[1:21:24] he don't sin you may blame your neighbor
[1:21:26] you may blame other people
[1:21:28] for your problems you may blame a lot of
[1:21:30] people but look at the mill
[1:21:32] your worst enemy is you don't blame
[1:21:35] nobody else don't let him come out of
[1:21:37] your lips to blame somebody else
[1:21:40] it's you it's you point it to your chest
[1:21:44] it's me
[1:21:45] your choices will take you somewhere in
[1:21:48] life
[1:21:50] [Music]
[1:21:53] i choose heaven i want you to understand
[1:21:55] i choose jesus
[1:21:56] [Applause]
[1:21:58] hallelujah
[1:22:02] shadrach meshach and abednego they roll
[1:22:04] off of our lips and we know them as the
[1:22:06] three hebrew children
[1:22:07] that had to take a stand amongst all
[1:22:09] their country brethren
[1:22:11] their government you may have to stand
[1:22:13] against your government one of these
[1:22:14] days too
[1:22:15] but we refuse to bend or bow
[1:22:19] and god met them in the fire and
[1:22:21] understand this today
[1:22:22] there's always room in your trial
[1:22:26] for the fourth man
[1:22:29] you may feel pinched and you may feel
[1:22:31] shut in there's always room for jesus in
[1:22:34] your trial
[1:22:36] he's in the boat bartimaeus experienced
[1:22:40] blindness
[1:22:42] and he spent a lifetime of blindness but
[1:22:44] i want you to understand one day jesus
[1:22:47] came by and he began to scream
[1:22:48] at his opportunity thou son of david
[1:22:52] have mercy upon me don't overlook
[1:22:55] your opportunities in life
[1:22:58] [Music]
[1:22:59] i said this the other day i feel
[1:23:01] impressed to say it again today
[1:23:03] many times the scripture says blessed is
[1:23:06] a man
[1:23:07] that endureth in his trials i want you
[1:23:10] to understand
[1:23:11] god in your trials of life
[1:23:14] makes a way of escape
[1:23:18] to keep you from falling but you need to
[1:23:22] take the way of escape
[1:23:24] be like joseph and take your coat off
[1:23:29] it may take you to prison but i'll not
[1:23:32] defile myself
[1:23:35] come on god i'll make a way of escape
[1:23:37] for you legion was found in the tombs
[1:23:42] he was founded the tombs and demons had
[1:23:46] destroyed his family destroyed him
[1:23:48] let me just say this you demons will
[1:23:50] destroy you in your life
[1:23:53] they may seem innocent at first that
[1:23:55] when they come in
[1:23:56] but lust will take you somewhere down
[1:23:58] the road
[1:24:00] envy will take you somewhere down the
[1:24:02] road
[1:24:03] it don't come in and say i'm going to
[1:24:05] destroy your life
[1:24:06] but a little lust a little pornographic
[1:24:09] spirit will break up your marriage
[1:24:11] [Applause]
[1:24:15] i'm preaching to you this morning you
[1:24:17] may hide it in your chambers but god
[1:24:19] knows all about it
[1:24:21] [Applause]
[1:24:22] but i want you to understand you can
[1:24:24] overcome that thing through the blood of
[1:24:26] jesus christ
[1:24:28] jealousy is a green night devil that
[1:24:31] will destroy you and eat the christ out
[1:24:33] of your lives
[1:24:35] somebody has more than you do just say
[1:24:37] thank god that they've got more
[1:24:39] than than what i've got but may they
[1:24:41] have the responsibility to know how to
[1:24:43] handle it
[1:24:45] are you with me now don't be jealous
[1:24:47] just work harder
[1:24:49] be content in whatever you had
[1:24:55] lazarus wound up in a tomb being jesus's
[1:24:58] very friend
[1:24:59] sometimes you think jesus has forgot you
[1:25:03] but he'll never forget you
[1:25:10] the human bra lab grab bag of life
[1:25:13] will take you in a lot of different
[1:25:14] directions just because you wind up in a
[1:25:17] nursing home facility
[1:25:19] doesn't mean god forgot you it's just a
[1:25:23] part of adam's curse
[1:25:25] but you can have the angels of god visit
[1:25:28] you
[1:25:28] every day of your life and stand guard
[1:25:31] over top of you are you with me
[1:25:33] [Applause]
[1:25:35] lazarus found himself in a tomb
[1:25:38] and listen even when jesus came back and
[1:25:41] he begins to tell
[1:25:42] his sisters where have you laid him
[1:25:46] they begin to explain to him by now he
[1:25:48] stinketh
[1:25:50] and he asked them to roll away the stone
[1:25:52] there's going to be times in
[1:25:54] your life that you're going to be asked
[1:25:56] to roll away the stones
[1:25:58] sure jesus could have spoken to destroy
[1:26:01] that stone
[1:26:02] in a moment's notice but sometimes he
[1:26:05] asked you to overcome
[1:26:11] when you come to that thing in your life
[1:26:13] and you're looking at your phone and it
[1:26:14] takes you to the wrong site
[1:26:16] you've got to have the grit in the
[1:26:18] backbone
[1:26:18] [Applause]
[1:26:20] come on help me preach now you're going
[1:26:23] to have the grit in the backbone
[1:26:26] i'm not just talking about pornography
[1:26:28] now
[1:26:29] i'm talking about those gossip sites
[1:26:32] [Applause]
[1:26:35] i'm talking about those gossip innocent
[1:26:37] like sights
[1:26:39] that hurt and break and destroy people's
[1:26:42] lives
[1:26:46] [Music]
[1:26:47] but you gotta rise above that thing
[1:26:50] cast it out of your life and say i
[1:26:53] refuse to be a slave to this enemy
[1:26:57] [Applause]
[1:26:57] [Music]
[1:27:00] maybe you have a habit in your life and
[1:27:03] and your thing has controlled your life
[1:27:05] and maybe it was alcoholism
[1:27:08] and it's a tough thing or smoking or
[1:27:10] actually drugs
[1:27:12] it's a tough thing to overcome because
[1:27:13] addiction actually gets in your body
[1:27:16] it can be sleep aids that can get in
[1:27:18] your right body can actually become
[1:27:20] just literally just actually grip you in
[1:27:23] such a way
[1:27:24] pain medicine can do the same thing but
[1:27:26] there's sometimes you've got to come to
[1:27:28] a spot
[1:27:29] to where you've got to tell that enemy
[1:27:32] you're not going to control my love
[1:27:37] and listen you've got to fall out of
[1:27:39] love with that demon
[1:27:42] and how it makes you feel because it's
[1:27:45] destroying your
[1:27:46] life
[1:27:46] [Applause]
[1:27:50] it's destroying your life it's like bad
[1:27:53] friends
[1:27:57] [Applause]
[1:27:59] it's like the wrong kind of associates
[1:28:02] they'll take you somewhere either you
[1:28:05] will influence them or they will
[1:28:07] influence you
[1:28:12] amen preaching to a whole lot of people
[1:28:15] here
[1:28:17] let me just say your friends will take
[1:28:18] you somewhere
[1:28:21] they're dirty spirits that get off on

[1:28:36] marriage working

[1:29:09] you they had to make
[1:29:10] choices god asked them to
[1:29:14] have only one god he asked him to put
[1:29:16] him first

[1:32:00] skins that was around the inside
[1:32:02] of the holies of holies that was the
[1:32:03] town what the tent was made of
[1:32:05] was badger skin so god hid himself
[1:32:08] behind badger skins
[1:32:10] in the old testament are you with me now
[1:32:12] so he's hiding himself behind by your
[1:32:14] skins
[1:32:15] here today
[1:32:29] that's why isaiah said we did esteem him
[1:32:32] smitten and afflicted of god
[1:32:34] yet he was wounded for our
[1:32:35] transgressions he was bruised for our
[1:32:38] iniquities
[1:32:38] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[1:32:41] him and with his stripes
[1:32:43] we were healed
[1:32:46] the perfect image of the ma god man god
[1:32:50] amorpha had changed from the
[1:32:52] supernatural
[1:32:54] to the vision and the vision was
[1:32:56] projected
[1:32:57] into the image and the image was smitten
[1:33:00] so that the supernatural could taste
[1:33:03] the feeling of death god's perfect
[1:33:07] masterpiece you wasn't god
[1:33:13] you're displayed through your father and
[1:33:15] your mother in the lineage all the way
[1:33:16] down

[1:33:35] what's laying on the inside of you
[1:33:37] he deposit a seed of eternal life and
[1:33:40] one day it becomes quicken in your life
[1:33:43] and you become

[1:34:44] he said he cut through every
[1:34:47] superstition

[1:35:02] in prayer lines

[1:35:06] to get that unbelief off your life

[1:35:11] and every doubt
[1:35:12] and made a prayer line from earth to
[1:35:14] glory
[1:35:15] in his ascension and he went up and sat

[1:45:43] and everybody's going to be an enemy but
[1:45:45] you don't have to go to hell
[1:45:48] god's made a way of provision and he
[1:45:50] said i am the way
[1:45:52] i am the truth i am
[1:45:59] thank you
[1:46:14] brother ryan i don't like people amen
[1:46:16] and i don't like people shouting i don't
[1:46:18] like all that don't go to hell
[1:46:21] don't go to heaven but let me remind you
[1:46:24] of one scripture that says let
[1:46:26] everything that hath breath praise ye
[1:46:27] the lord
[1:46:29] and i want you to remind you the only
[1:46:31] excuse you have for not praising god
[1:46:33] is if you're clinically dead
[1:46:40] and i as your people as your pastor when
[1:46:43] i look out and you got your head
[1:46:45] between your knees and you're always
[1:46:47] sulking
[1:46:48] i just consider you dead one day i'll
[1:46:51] bury you in a casket
[1:46:53] but until then raise up and live you got
[1:46:56] an
[1:46:56] opportunity to praise god now's your
[1:47:06] time
[1:47:18] the scripture says to him that
[1:47:19] overcometh will i grant to sit with me
[1:47:21] and my throne
[1:47:22] to him that overcometh put your
[1:47:26] name in the scripture even as i also
[1:47:29] overcame and sat down with my father
[1:47:32] in his throne i want to remind you of a
[1:47:34] few things
[1:47:35] we are pre-planned we are built to
[1:47:38] overcome
[1:47:41] so quit acting like you're defeated and
[1:47:44] rise up and take your place
[1:47:46] in the scriptures if a book of acts is
[1:47:49] going to be written behind it
[1:47:51] let them write a scripture about you
[1:47:54] overcoming in your life

[1:48:05] you need in the word of god
[1:48:07] god has not equipped you just to fight
[1:48:10] with a
[1:48:10] rock or even a sling but you've given
[1:48:13] everything in the word
[1:48:15] to to fight at your disposal the
[1:48:17] scripture says
[1:48:19] that we're going to be the overcomers of
[1:48:20] this age that's regardless of the
[1:48:23] situation

[1:50:31] he walks two miles a day he's given my
[1:50:33] testimony
[1:50:34] this man is known around the world
[1:50:39] his words i'm not embellishing
[1:50:42] i don't lie

[1:51:03] will they say about you i'm not talking
[1:51:05] about your critic i'm talking about your
[1:51:07] friend
[1:51:08] what will they say about you
[1:51:21] this young man's been with us basically
[1:51:24] lived in our home
[1:51:27] since the diagnosis and had some
[1:51:28] incredibly low times
[1:51:33] you know some of you some of you
[1:51:36] no doubt have different wars and i
[1:51:38] wouldn't want to walk yours and you
[1:51:39] wouldn't want to walk mine
[1:51:42] but brother gabriel has been with theirs
[1:51:44] through the whole time
[1:51:46] and he he seen he's seen the journey
[1:51:51] first six months was incredibly
[1:51:52] difficult
[1:51:54] as a matter of fact it was hard for me
[1:51:55] to get out of a recliner
[1:51:57] because my energy was so low
[1:52:00] it was in one of the lowest days
[1:52:06] i would i would calculate one of the
[1:52:07] lowest days sitting in that recliner
[1:52:10] with the devil whispering in my ear
[1:52:13] you know isn't he stupid
[1:52:17] isn't he stupid he should have known
[1:52:20] this was coming
[1:52:23] but it didn't look to him like this was
[1:52:25] coming because he can't see that
[1:52:27] there's a sermon there because satan
[1:52:30] can't see your future
[1:52:32] so he has to fight with you where you're
[1:52:34] at
[1:52:35] and god just so put it on brother
[1:52:38] aidan's heart
[1:52:41] to call me facetime me and i answered
[1:52:46] and he said brother ron you've always
[1:52:48] wanted to come to the greenhouse to see
[1:52:49] the miracle
[1:52:50] but today i'm going to give you a tour
[1:52:54] of the miracle he's got he's got family
[1:52:58] none of his family is ever there at the
[1:53:00] same time on this day
[1:53:03] it's unchoreographed
[1:53:06] he starts walking and every one of his
[1:53:09] family members are there so
[1:53:12] as he's walking and he comes to a
[1:53:14] section maybe it's the roses
[1:53:16] or maybe it's a different flower maybe
[1:53:18] it's this one there would be somebody
[1:53:20] there that was working
[1:53:21] and they would stop and and talk to me
[1:53:24] and say brother ron we love you
[1:53:26] we love you with all of our hearts we

[1:54:58] there was a little girl that was nine
[1:55:00] years in a bed and read a promise book

[1:55:02] and that she prayed that god would send
[1:55:05] a deliverer
[1:55:06] and god came on the scene for her we
[1:55:08] could talk about a blind man in bombay
[1:55:11] or a blind man in mexico or a woman with
[1:55:14] a dead baby
[1:55:15] we could talk about hattie wright and
[1:55:17] her two sons coming to the lord

[1:55:58] backwoods somewhere another
[1:56:00] but around the world seven times
[1:56:05] hundreds of thousands of cases stood on
[1:56:08] the platform
[1:56:09] and they heard their name called their
[1:56:11] address called
[1:56:12] and let me just say this it was more
[1:56:13] than a prayer it was a deliverance
[1:56:17] they came into this service go thy way
[1:56:19] as your faith is so be it done unto you
[1:56:23] their faith was read god knew their name
[1:56:25] god knew their condition
[1:56:27] and walked across that platform brother
[1:56:30] brown being the brother
[1:56:31] the prophet of the hour and the gift was
[1:56:34] on display
[1:56:36] those people knew they had met more than
[1:56:38] a man they met god
[1:56:40] i'd say tonight i felt him here last
[1:56:42] night i feel him here this morning
[1:56:44] it's more than a church service
[1:56:47] more than a man but god's on the scene
[1:56:56] we heard sermons like the seven seals
[1:56:58] the church ages who is this melchizedek
[1:57:01] we heard god as reeled in his own word
[1:57:03] we heard god as his own interpreter
[1:57:05] mighty god unveiled the token
[1:57:07] the masterpiece we heard all of these
[1:57:11] messages
[1:57:13] it didn't come from the mind of a man it
[1:57:14] came from god
[1:57:16] god was equipping you
[1:57:21] he was equipping you to overcome
[1:57:25] that's right
[1:57:28] listen the potential is in you
[1:57:32] god don't have to deposit more it's
[1:57:33] already in you i won't be much longer

[1:57:38] every service
[1:57:39] you shouldn't need to be primed the seed
[1:57:42] has already got life on the inside of it
[1:57:46] every resource is at your disposal
[1:57:49] god will give you the strength and the
[1:57:51] energy like he's given me over the last
[1:57:53] year and a half
[1:57:55] i've not walked by his own energy

[2:03:18] george washington into every county
[2:03:21] and it won't turn this nation around
[2:03:23] only jesus is the answer
[2:03:29] the scripture says be you therefore
[2:03:31] ready for in such an hour as you think
[2:03:33] not the son of man cometh
[2:03:36] let me just advise you i would be a
[2:03:39] high intensity
[2:03:46] when i walked into service many years
[2:03:48] ago
[2:03:51] i took notes before i was ever a
[2:03:53] preacher
[2:03:54] because i felt like god was going to
[2:03:56] speak to me whoever
[2:03:58] if they could not preach their way out
[2:04:00] of a paper bag
[2:04:01] somewhere in that service if i pulled
[2:04:03] hard enough god was going to speak to my
[2:04:05] life
[2:04:05] but i had to be attentive
[2:04:09] if you walk out of this building today
[2:04:10] and say i didn't get nothing's cause you
[2:04:12] didn't put nothing in
[2:04:15] you see if you don't plant some corn
[2:04:17] seed you will not have a harvest
[2:04:19] in the fall don't expect tomatoes if you
[2:04:23] don't plant them
[2:04:25] [Applause]
[2:04:30] amen don't become
[2:04:33] allow church to become common now let me
[2:04:36] just give you some pointers here and
[2:04:37] then then i'm going to give you
[2:04:38] just a couple more things don't allow
[2:04:41] church to become common
[2:04:45] don't come here and look over and see
[2:04:48] what so-and-so's got on to where
[2:04:55] you'd shoot me and i wouldn't couldn't
[2:04:57] tell you somebody told me the other day
[2:04:59] you preached in the same suit
[2:05:06] well that's all right i like it
[2:05:11] i like it and it fits
[2:05:14] it's not falling off it fits
[2:05:18] don't have a whole lot of holes in it i
[2:05:20] really like it i got anointed in it last
[2:05:22] time i feel like i get anointed in it at
[2:05:24] this time
[2:05:24] [Applause]
[2:05:28] it doesn't matter if both of my socks
[2:05:30] are the same color
[2:05:32] so many people are looking for carnal
[2:05:34] things
[2:05:36] now i brought you to a trap you can hear
[2:05:39] a sermon for about an hour
[2:05:42] and remember the carnal part of that
[2:05:45] that's right two weeks ago some of you
[2:05:48] were mesmerized by kissing under stars
[2:05:53] and that's all you got out of a service
[2:05:54] called unlimited
[2:05:56] i got hundreds of texts about a carnal
[2:05:59] statement
[2:06:00] but it was a trap
[2:06:07] come on church you've got to get beyond
[2:06:11] your carnal realm
[2:06:17] and by the way you need to kiss under
[2:06:18] the stars your wife
[2:06:21] if you ain't done it for a while try it
[2:06:23] out it works
[2:06:30] world glory
[2:06:53] [Laughter]
[2:06:56] brother harold god bless you
[2:07:02] he's slapping his knee right now
[2:07:06] now i like what god's vision is amen
