TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] if jesus christ stood there and read that day this day this word fulfilled before you god's obligated to make that word come to pass we stand here night and say that jesus christ is the same yesterday and forever god's obligated to prove that to be sold because it's his word now what does it do it takes faith and believing it takes faith in believing his word that it is the truth notice what come to pass when moses brought the children out to all those that followed him those who did not follow state in egypt but those who followed moses when they come out of the red sea and got out into the wilderness god came down upon mount sinai that pillar fire set the whole mountain on fire and a boy spoke out of there god gave the 10 commandments moses could have walked up there before the people and say this day the scripture that i have told you as his prophet comes to pass this day i've told you that god bet me and not buried a burning bush in a pillar farm and he said this oh this will be a sign you'll bring them people right back to this place here again and there is god in the same pillar of far i told you that hanging right there on the mountain this day this prophecy is fulfilled here he is to vindicate that the things i've said is the truth god give us more man like that that's honest and sincere and tell the truth that god almighty could vindicate that his word is still true he remains the same yesterday ever why wouldn't he do it he promised to do it joshua he might have said the same the day that he come back to katie sparnia where they had journeyed so far in the wilderness they were doubting the land being the kind of land that god said it would be but god told them it was a good language he was born with milk and honey and joshua and caleb was the only two that would believe it out of the other 10 that left when they come back they had the evidence they had a bunch of grapes that too strong men could only carry joshua and caleb stood right there and said this day this scripture is fulfilled here's the evidence that it is a good land sure why there's the evidence that it's a good land words you ever get such things as that in egypt there was no such places but this day this scripture is fulfilled he could have said the thing same when he prophesied and said the walls of jericho would fall down after they marched around seven times seven days seven times a day and when they marched around that last time the walls fell down josh away go to step and said this day the chief captain of the host of the lord that told me weeks ago that it would happen like this this day this scripture is fulfilled i leave the walls flat on the ground come on let's go take it it belongs to us this day this scripture is fulfilled how wonderful man of god has stood for the things that's right israel at the river when they possess the land went over how they going to do it it's a month of april the floods are coming down because the snow was melting up in judea oh what a poor uh general it seemed like it god was to bring these people there in the month of april when the jordan is higher back than it ever was sometimes i might could stop here if i had time to give you just a little tip sometimes you may be studying either with cancer you might be studying with a disease you think why me being a christian would be in this way why would i be sitting like this if i'm a christian sometimes god lets the things get so dark that you can't see up around or anywhere else then he comes and makes a way through it she might say this day this scripture is being fulfilled that he promised to do he let the hebrew children walk right into the fiery furnace they said our god is able to deliver us in as far as the furnace but nevertheless we'll not bow down to your image when they walk down there at the smell that furnace upon them no smell will furnish rather upon them they could have said this thing is this scripture fulfilled daniel come from the lines then he could have said the same thing john the baptist after 400 years of ecclesiastical teaching no one of that church was in a mess at that time when he appeared in the wilderness of georgia he just stood right down the bank as he did and say this day this picture isaiah party is fulfilled how i could stop here and tell you what the old priest told me said son you never finished that message i said keep still he said you mean that pentecostals don't see that i said no he said i said and a catholic preached he said why didn't you go and i said keep still he said glory to god i see it and about that time the holy ghost fell on his sister sitting out there in a meeting and she raised up speaking in unknowing tongues and gave the interpretation of the very thing that the priest and i were talking about on the platform the old church the whole face went into a door the old robbers convention last week or week before last it was the talk of the convention how did that priest say that the holy spirit revealed out there to a woman his sister i believe it was and what was taking place up there on the platform and revealed that thing that we were hiding [Music] the hour that we're living this day this picture is fulfilled this day the evening lights have come and we fail to see it notice john said this day i am the voice of one crying in the wilderness that said the prophet isaiah prepare the way for the lord they didn't understand said oh you're jesus you're the christ rather he said i am not the christ he said i'm not worthy to lose his shoes but he said he's standing among you somewhere or he was sure that he would be there he'd be in his day because god told him he was to introduce the messiah one day a young man's come walking down to the scene uh like a light over the top of him aside and he cried out behold the lamb of god this day this scripture is fulfilled before you sure at the day of pentecost how peter stood up and quoted the scripture of joel 2 38 when they was all laughing those people they couldn't talk in their own language they were jabbering off something else the bible said cloven tongues cloven is a party tongue not saying nothing just a jabber and running around like a bunch of drunk people they all said well these people are drunk look at them look how they're acting how they have women and men they're disorderly said that religious group of that day peter stood up in the midst of him said any brethren you that dwell in jerusalem and you that dwell in judea let it be known unto you that these are not drunk as you suppose seeing it's the third hour today but this is that which is spoken by the prophet joel it'll come to pass in the last days uh pour out my spirit upon old flesh this day this scripture was fulfilled certainly luther was right on time wesley was right on time pentecost was right on time nothing out of the order now i asked you to consider the age and time we now live in with the promised word for today if back in other ages man could say this day this scripture this day this scripture then what about the scripture for this day what's promised for this day amen where are we standing what hour are we living when the clock is beating the scientific clock three minutes before midnight world has got the jitters the church is in a bed of corruption nobody knows where they're standing what time of day is it what about the scripture for this day the conditions of the church or the conditions of the church today in the world politics our world system is just as rotten as it can be i'm not a politician i'm a christian but i got no business talk about politics but i just want to say they're rotten on both sides [Music] i voted once that was for christ i got to win the devil voted against me christ voted for me depends on which way i cast my vote i'm glad i cast it on him that the world say what they want to i still believe that he's the same yesterday today and forever he'll prove it certainly will [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] so so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] i'll fly away o glory [Music]

us on the way amen god bless you can be seated this evening in the presence of the lord we we certainly counted an awesome honor to to be here this evening and to thank the lord for the good news that we've heard this week and we just can't thank the lord enough dad got some really good reports and i believe the uh sister whitney or or the team there on the church facebook had sent out some things and i've had people ask me where where do we look for the best the best news and either come across this pulpit or we'll put it on the facebook we have control of that so so we know what's getting put out we've you can't imagine what we've heard brother ron looks pretty good for being on hospice don't he you can't imagine what we've heard so so we thank you for being mindful of the right news and and getting it right from the horse's mouth and but we're certainly privileged to be able to witness the hand of our lord and what we're seeing is nothing else than than our lord at work and he got some really good news the doctors were just testifying to us of what we already knew was coming the doctor said that there was no new lesions in the bl in the brain or in the lungs and they actually said that the that what it looked like now they're waiting on the final readings but it looked like scar tissue in his lungs so we just give the lord thanks for that so we're waiting on words from them on cancer free those are the words we're wanting to hear and when we get on that side of it we're still going to pray and we'll get three months past those words we're still going to pray because we know the enemy hates us and so do we just want to stay and steadfast in his word and holding up the hands of faith and you know this year has certainly certainly messed up a lot of things and a lot of plans that we've had a lot of a lot of times this year we would have been this past couple weeks we'd have been at camp meetings and and different meetings and different conventions that's went on and one of the things that i always look forward to is brother george quinn coming by our way and uh this this year has kind of messed up some things for us of him coming here and him being able to to go in missionary and different things and and let me say this to me brother george is one of the greatest missionaries that the world has ever seen and so i i have a little video that i'd like to share with you this evening brother george hasn't been able to be here but what has happened is me and brother george have become closer as friends being able to corresponding once a week twice a week and it's built a friendship that that would not have developed if if if it would not been for covet and things like this and the circumstances of our pastor going through things and i can't tell you how many times that the the lord used brother george in these last six months to speak to me and so brother george has a as a greeting for you tonight if brothers could turn the lights down god bless you everybody uh this is brother george as you know sister jackie beside me here this is my our little dog and we just uh want to take this opportunity of saying uh god bless you all uh in the full gospel lighthouse tabernacle this evening and we certainly have been uh on stream with you since brother ronald's uh illness but uh we've really enjoyed our time with you and we'll continue on until your pastor is 100 past fully healed and we're looking forward to that day and we're here in ireland we've had a lovely day today and we just trust and pray that his uh his uh results today will just be just be wonderful so god bless you all and thank you for your prayers we're so sorry we missed you this year but i just um i've asked the lord to make up for my up here and give us this time to be able to serve them again far away from home as i've done for the last 30 years so the lord bless you all and uh keep singing keep testifying keep praising god and press on for your home we're nearing the golden sword amen we certainly love brother king george amen we we love him with all of our hearts and and certainly appreciate his ministry he has ministered to our hearts many times and and we just can't wait to sit down on the other side and hear all the good things of god and the things that he's seen and things that he stood for and he stood for this message through through thick and thin and good times and in bad times and i'm so thankful to be privileged to be able to call brother george our brother in christ and friend amen would you stand with me this evening and we sing that song that counts as stars one and all amen he counts the stars and warning he knows how much sand is on the shore he sees every sparrow that falls he made the mountains and the seas he's in control of everything i'm both creatures great and so and he knows my name every step that i take every move that i make every tear that i cry and he knows my name when i am overwhelmed by the pain and can't see the light of day i know i'll be just fine cause he knows my name i don't know what tomorrow may bring i can't tell you what's in store i don't know a lot of things i don't have all the answers to the questions of life but i know in whom i have lived and he knows my name every step that i take every move that i make every tear that i cry and he knows my name when i'm overwhelmed by the pain i can't see the light of day i know i'll be just fine cause he knows my name hallelujah jesus father we thank you lord for the atmosphere that fills this place tonight what a mighty and awesome god that you are for those that are listening by the way of streaming tonight you're awesome for them wherever they may be at father the need that they may have lord you're more than enough lord i pray tonight that you would condition our hearts lord for the things that he'll bring forth and do season lord lord we want to we want to take this moment to say that we love you we want to take this time lord jesus be able to express the good things of god father we know that we've gathered here tonight lord more than just a more than just a commemoration of things but we've gathered here to lift up the name of jesus christ father it has always been a purpose in my life ever since you got a hold of me father lord to be able to lift your name high and lord i pray that by by the end of this service lord that i will have spent all of my energies lifting it higher lifting the name of jesus high as humanly possible that i can but father i pray that the angel of the lord would come and take over the service father lord even take your word lord and lift it higher than i could lord ever humanly so i asked god that you would let me get out of the way so that you could have control of this service just now i yield my members to you my mind soul body and spirit lord ask that you take over every realm here and every spirit of unbelief that would try to block any person from receiving their healing receiving the touch of the lord i pray that that you would just begin to bind the spirit of the enemy father and i pray that you would lose heaven on earth just now god we give you praise may you speak to us in jesus name amen if you have your bibles we'll turn over in the book of isaiah chapter 59 and 59 and verse verse 19. i'd like to look here in this in this book of isaiah 59 again and bring forth a context to you today on lifting lifting up the standard lifting up the standard isaiah chapter 59 and verse 19 and just thank the lord for the opportunity to be able to lift his name on high this week my my little girl ally uh just five years old and i believe she's five now they're correct six and see things growing up on me so so fast i can't hardly keep up covett had a good thing of messing everybody's calendars up and uh but she was she was praying praying over our breakfast one day this week and she began to pray and she said thank you god for giving us pawpaw back from cancer amen thank you god for giving us paul paul back from cancer jesus took it back amen amen isaiah chapter 59 and verse 19 and so shall they fear the name of the lord from the west and his glory from the rising of the sun and when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the lord shall lift up a standard can we say that together lift up a standard against him when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the lord shall lift up a standard against him if you have a scofield bible flip back about five pages over to isaiah chapter 53 verse three the bible says here that he is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of god and afflicted he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are and with his stripes we are healed may god bless his word he may be seated in the presence of the lord this evening so he said we'd like to speak to you on on lifting lifting up the standard a standard is a is a symbol as a symbol that is carried on a pole when it's raised high in the air and it's the standard is much like a flag in which a a in it's much like a flag to rally a tribe or a group of warriors in battle you see the standard or ensigns were most likely like carvings in the old testament were were probably like carvings or likenesses of animals raised on a pole and they would take that standard and they would they would set it up on a hill so that all the tribes would sit there and maybe one day will go into those things of those different tribes in the head of those tribes of of each of those of those banners that was lifted up there but that that ensign it was a flag or a banner or of a military band and a band of a banner of colors and of a standard and we we all know that if we're very familiar here in the south of being acquainted with the civil war we're aware of things that that that we're acquainted with because of this valley and because of the history that is here that we know that there were those men in in the battle that were called standard bearers and those those bearers would take the standard or the flag and they would they would bear that flag wherever they would go and maybe you know the term of it called the color guard and that color guard was was protected by a personal guard and you see that that color guard or the standard bearer was always his job was always to lift the standard it was always to put the standard before the people that was his job was to make sure that he lifted the standard and those and those guards were there that if that that standard bearer got shot that the guards would grab that standard and they would lift it up because you see it's it's a great morale for the people and the company of the army when they begin to see their flag or they begin to see that standard that is lifted before them and you see the purpose of a standard bearer was to give the unit's member a visual signal as to where the unit was and if in the course of a fight you were separated from your unit and one looked around until you saw that standard and then tried to get back close to it so you can imagine as if maybe you're fighting in in the battle you're right in the middle of the civil war and you're you're fighting and you've been fighting and you've you you've taken your bayonet and you've taken your gun and you you've shot every round that you could and you're fighting in in your own little circle and you can't you can't really find where everybody else is in the battle so your eyes hit the horizon and they look out on the horizon and they're looking for that standard and you see the standard bearer was normally was in close proximity to the leader of the unit so so if we would if we would see that general lee was uh was leading out so we would see that that standard bearer was very close or or whoever the general was or however the leader was they were real close by and though they they were they're very closely placed in a placement of where they wanted to lead the charge in and the placement of those regimental flags served as a visual as a communication during civil war battles as you can imagine if somebody would shout out we're going over here or we're leading this way or or the confederates were hit it this way but you see in the midst of battle when they're in the midst of a ray of bullets flying around them and vocal commands and bugle calls would not be have heard so they were looking for that standard that was going before them because in the midst of that noisy battlefield they could not see or could not hear where they were going so the soldier was trained to look for that standard and you see when the standard bearer when whenever the standard bearer would go and retreat the whole the whole company would run in in retreat they would they would go wherever that standard would go i want you to know this this evening that the standard of god has never went in retreat but it's always went forward and god's children do not back up and they don't give in and they don't back off of his promises but the standard of god is always before them and when now when the standard fell when the flag fell the unit members did not have a visual rallying point to go around or to go and to go to and just for just for giving you these things a loss of a standard in battle was considered to be one of the worst things to happen you see it was it was one of the worst things to lose your flack it was it meant that the honor of the unit was lost so it's an amazing thing to keep the standard it's an amazing thing to keep your eyes on the standard it's an amazing thing to know that you do not want to lose the standard and notice this also that capturing a standard by an opponent was considered to be tremendous a tremendous act of courage so we know that by reading history and by reading history books that there were specific men that were sent out in battles that would go out and they would try to take that standard or steal that standard or shoot down that standard bearer and they would go over and try to take that standard because it would show an act of courage on behalf of the army and so you see that you can imagine as is as if they were going out after this flag there's a lot of pride in this area of flying the confederate flag around here but you can imagine as some of as some of the the boys here in the valley and they're fighting and somebody on the union side comes in and they want to steal that flag and they're trying to come in that would be that would be considered considered an act of courage that they would go in and try to do those things in the same way vice versa going in and getting the union flag or the regiment flag but you know i can maybe put it to you in scriptural terms you see goliath was the philistine standard and that standard was set out in a valley one day and and they they lifted it up before the people and that that that standard was out there screaming for 40 days send us out a man down here and come and send me a man that'll fight with us but when david heard of these things in his courage he slipped down into the valley and said i'm going to go down and i'm going to steal that standard i'm going to take down the enemy standard and what did david do he went down there and he captured that standard when he took that standard's head off he lifted that standard up with the sword of goliath and he looked back at all the armies of israel and said boys you can come on all the way i've already taken down their standard i've already taken away their honor you see they were comfortable and as long as goliath was out there but when goliath got his head taken off they were no longer comfortable standing in the fight and i want you to know that the devil is not comfortable because when jesus christ took the hill on galgotha you see he stripped the standard of hell and he took away the standard of hell when he took death out of the way he stripped all the honor from hell and hell has no honor left to it because death has been defeated the standard of hell has no honor it has no honor because the standard of hell has been taken hallelujah he came and he took the standard away from them and so all you know today is that satan and all the demons of hell all they are is a bunch of windbacks because they have no power they have no authority because the prophet told me that when jesus christ took calvary he stripped every power every authority every bit that the devil had jesus christ came and he took it all the way from the devil it was an act of courage when jesus went up on the cross and he looked back to all the armies of israel and said we can take all of it just follow me we can take all of it you see it was a soldier that soldier takes great deal of pride in those flags there's a lot of people that don't appreciate this american flag but i got a great deal of pride in myself still i'm still thankful for the red white and blue i'm still thankful for this nation it seems like it's in a disarray but there's still a lot of pride left in me [Applause] i'm with her in her glory and i'm with her in her shame and when those men when those those battle flags were coming back you see those men were watching that flag and those men always watched they watched that flag and they treated that flag with reverence because it lifted a standard to them you see when men were fighting over in world war one and world war ii when they seen that flag they could look at that flag and it was a standard for them it was a rallying point for them and they would look at that flag and they could look at that flag and they would realize that back in that homeland there's a family there that i'm fighting for there's a land that i'm fighting for that we could be free now notice in the inside the prophet said that god appropriated the ensign and god gives you something to hold on to an insight like a flag hanging and in korea and all down in the islands during the time of the war when the americans had drove back the japanese and they run up in guam in different places to the top of the hill the highest hill that they could find and there with tears running down their cheeks with with shouts they they planted the american flag oh glory above the hillside and they they conquered the land and and what an achievement it was to lift up that ensign and say that this belongs to us and oh what a privilege it was for those soldiers to stand there on the land that they had conquered he said i tell you that god gave the church an ensign one day when jesus was lifted up on calvary between heavens and earth and none other god emmanuel bleeding out his blood upon the ground and there was an ensign lifted up to the people that we have conquered we have we are more than conquerors be he because he conquered it for us when those men were the americans when they were taking the island of iwo jima and they were there and they were in the midst of battle and they were looking at the battle and the japanese were all afraid and they were in caves and there was much warfare that was going on there was some men that was bearing a standard and said it's time that we lift the standard over this place and say that we have conquered this land and when they climbed up that hill they were getting shot at when they climbed up that hill they was going willing to give their life just to put the standard on the top of that hill because they knew that they were going to win that battle but i love what i love about this story is that they didn't just do it once they did it twice they climbed up there first with a small flag and the boy said that's not good enough we need to put a big one up there so they went back to their ships and they got himself a good old-sized one so that everybody that was on the seaside and everybody that was on the shore could see that this standard was flying up there you see adam there was a covenant made for adam when he walked out when he walked out of the garden of eden showing it took the blood but god said that's not good enough i'm gonna hang my son up there so that it shows a sign to all the world that i have conquered this land and satan tonight knows that when every son and daughter of god has placed that sign that token of the holy ghost upon their life that satan knows that this land has already been conquered and already been paid for by almighty god i want to tell satan you can't take our flag you can't take our standard [Music] we're waving this standard of the word we're carrying it high and satan can't take it hallelujah hallelujah you see if you let the holy ghost go to control in your life go to controlling your soul and controlling your spirit and all the five realms of your of your flesh a seed tastes feel and smell if you go to let him working in your life and washing out your memory and and begin to move in your life you'll watch that you are now packing the image of the standard you're packing everything that he is you see because you're packing his own life hallelujah hallelujah turn with me over to exodus chapter 17 and verse 8. hallelujah do you love the lord tonight the bible says here in exodus 17-8 then came amalek and fought with israel and referred them and moses said unto joshua choose out choose us out men and go out and fight with amalek tomorrow and i will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of god in my hand so joshua did as moses had said to him and fought with amalek and moses and her aaron and her went up to the top of the hill and it came to pass that when moses held up his hand that israel prevailed and when he let down his hand amalek prevailed but moses's hands were heavy and they took a stone and put it under him and he sat there on and aaron and her stayed up his hands they one on their one side and one on the other side and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun and joshua discomforted amalek and his people with the edge of the sword and the lord said unto moses write for this write this for a memorial in a book and rehearse it in the ears of joshua for i will utterly put out the remembrance of amalek from under heaven and moses built an altar and called the name of it jehovah jehovah nisi the name jehovah nesi it means jehovah that he is yahweh he is the self-existing one the true god but niecy means the true banner under which victory is certain you see joshua is going down into a valley he's going down into this valley and he don't understand that he's going down through there and he knows that moses said i'm going to be up there on that hill that i'm going to be that standard i'm going to stand up there with the rod of god in my hand and joshua was just fighting away but joshua don't know why the battle keeps going this way and why it keeps going that way he don't understand he don't understand that when moses is lifting up his hands he's winning he's prevailing but when his hands are hanging down low then the amalekites are prevailing over them so many times you've been in a fight you've been in a fight and it seems like man of life i'm tearing every devil up in hell and then sometimes you're going through a battle and it feels like my lord they're whipping me all over the place you see there was somebody that was lifting your hands up there was somebody that was lifting your hands up in prayer saying hey look over there lord jesus my brother and my sisters in the midst of pain would you go and meet them and it feels like you're getting you're getting whipped one day and all of a sudden there comes a charge of the holy ghost over top of you and you just square up on the devil and you kick him right in the teeth it's somebody lifting you up you're seeing joshua didn't understand what was going on down here but you see all those up there where the standard was was realizing what was taking place they were watching the battle down there they watched as moses held his hand up they were winning and they watched when the hand went down that they they began to prevail the enemy began to prevail over top of the children of israel i will say this to you church somebody might have to get me a seat somebody might have to give me a seat and let me sit down and somebody might have to hold up his hand and hold up that hand but i'm going to stay there until you get complete victory you look at your loved one and you look at your family say i'm going to have a camping party and i'm going to stay right here until you get this thing settled out you know the holy ghost is watching over top of you he's got your hands lifted up when you don't feel him he's there when you don't see him he's there he's got you in battle he's got you in good times here the israelites were fighting under the direction of god and in the defense of his truth you see the name of jehovah became the armored bearing of the whole congregation and by his direction they fought and in his name and strife they conquered it was because jehovah was on their side is while they were winning are you with me it's not because the preacher standing there that you're winning it's not because the song leader is leading that you're winning it's because the holy ghost is remaining hallelujah brother branham said in the greatest battle fault he said they cut their way through right into freedom he said those israelites were cutting their way all the way into freedom and he said when moses stood upon that mountain and he stood there and they lifted his hands up when his hands got weary and when his hands got tired it was only a type of what jesus would do at calvary he said and to make sure that jesus's hands didn't go down they nailed his hands to a cross so that you would be a sword the absolute victory his hands couldn't come down on calvary he didn't do a halfway job he finished it and when it got done he said it is finished [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah the bible says in psalms 16 4 thou hast given us a banner to them that fear thee that it may be displayed because of truth salah who thou has given a banner to them that fear thee isaiah 13 and 2 lift up a banner upon the high mountain and exalt the voice unto them and shake the hand that they may go into the gates of the nobles now we can understand by by what we've just went through of the lifting up of the banner on the high mountain that this lifting up on the high of the banner it was a standard that was placed on a high mountain that was showing all the tribes that this is where we're going to meet at that this is where you are to assemble it out and it said to exalt the voice unto them it was to let loose a battle cry that this is what we're going to do but he said shake the hand that they may go into the gates of the nobles let me tell you i am no longer responsible for my actions shake the hand that they may go into the gates of the nobles you see there's a lot of times when somebody stand beside you and say we're going this way and we're going to fight all the way till we get that way and this is where we are to meet at and this is where we are to do battle at but when you can't hear your neighbor's voice when you can't hear them because of all the chaos that's going around when you hear the clinging of shields and spears and swords and you can't see where to go at the prophet said shake the hand shake the hand this is where we're going to we're walking all the way over here and we're going to bring destruction to babylon now i know some of you you're a little bit quiet and you don't like lifting your voice and you don't like shouting a man but next time just so i know just shake the hand at me just shake your hand at me because i'm telling you when i see you shaking your hand you're saying hey brother andrew come right here i'm right on top of a devil and this is where we're going to destroy him at [Applause] satan take a look we're not waving at you hello we're waving at you goodbye shake the hand this is where destruction is happening at full gospel lighthouse in your home on the stream shake the hand oh goodbye world i stand no longer with you hallelujah goodbye devil i stand no longer with you i made up my mind to go god's way the rest of my life [Music] i made up my mind to go god's way the rest of my life hallelujah born born born again thank god i'm born again i'm born born born again thank god i'm born again born of the water spirit and the blood thank god i'm born again born of the water spirit and the blood thank god i'm born again goodbye cancer we'll stand no longer with you goodbye depression we stand no longer with you we've made up our mind to go god's way the rest of my life we made up my mind to go god's way the rest of my life goodbye world goodbye world goodbye world goodbye lay on us here goodbye depression goodbye anxiety this is where we're meeting that on the other side [Applause] give the lord a handclap of praise [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah what was it it was the lifting up of the banner the lifting up of the inside that showed us where we're going to victory at every child could probably sing this scripture he brought me into his banqueting house and his banner over me his love when solomon begins to express this he said he begins to write his letter of love and the queen says he brought me unto his house of wine he brought me to the house of stimulation he brought me to the joys of revelation and it stimulates me because he brought me to the house of wine hallelujah and what was it it was his banner over me hallelujah it was l o v he hallelujah he brought me he paid for me he redeemed me i was rightfully his in the first place i never belonged to satan hallelujah sometimes children you may feel like you're the worst of christians and you may feel like the devil's got you but if god has put a shield or predestination upon your life you never was the devils you never will be the devils hallelujah and he will never be yours but you were his he's covered you with his life [Applause] you see his standard is his word and when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of the lord lifts up the standard you remember me telling you about when i went out there to wyoming and i was floating down that snake river we're going down that thing and that river is such a massive massive river it's got millions of gallons of water that it's dumped through that river every so often and it's such powerful because all the snow that's coming down off those mountains and our guide that we was with we was down there he was telling us the power of that river how that it floods out every year and it erodes all the banks around it that there were houses and farmhouses that were built there when the early settlers came and because of the erosion that came and came from that river it robbed them of those shelters and all of a sudden when that river it just kept eroding and eroding and eroding and those houses just fell in you see that's what a powerful river will do and when the enemy comes in like a flood he tries to erode away your faith and i wrote away this message and aurora wrote away your family history in this message and arrow and wrote away what the pastor says and he rode away the singing and he wrote away the praise he wrote away the worship that's what the enemy wants to do but when the enemy comes in like a flood god raises the standard of his word and he looks at satan and said that's enough what does god do when he comes he stops the erosion and he starts building back some of you walked up in here if we could talk about your spiritual life you walked up in church and you was like a halfway person if we could look at your spiritual life we designed you as a man you were halfway your legs were halfway eaten off your heart was halfway eating off your mind was halfway eaten off because the enemy was eroding everything that you were meant to be but when jesus came he built you up to be in a perfect stature of the perfect man and you would be capped with the love of god you see his standard is his word and when god goes to pointing to something or pointing you or something he's not going to point you to some sign or some emotion he's going to point you to his word now there'll be signs that follow his word there'll be wonders that follow his word because jesus said that these signs shall follow them that believe that in my name in my name they shall cast out devils in my name that shall speak with new tongues in my name they shall drink drink any deadly thing and it shall not hurt them and shall take up any deadly thing and it shall not hurt them and in my name they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover these signs shall follow them that belief you see the signs will point you to the belief don't you get about excited about signs and wonders they're just following you we're not following them they're following us but i want to point the world out there that's listening that's hearing these tapes hearing these messages if you follow them signs it'll point you to our belief are you with me you see you go down the road and you see a sign it says you getting ready to come into grotto's and you look on the backside of that sign and says you just left grottos that's how big our town is but that sign is pointing you to something and moses was the signpost for israel's deliverance and the prophet said and i as i was with moses 1960 he said now what if moses when he went down there and he had a sign with a stick and within with his hand the sign here is no more the commission than it was with moses well if all the israelites say say oh all you egyptians all the rest of you israelites come over here we got a man to do a trick with his hands you ought to see it we got a man that can take a stick and make a snake out of it come see it that was just a signpost that wasn't the commission they wasn't waiting for a signpost they was waiting on deliverance but the son proved the commission you see he had the gift in his hand he had the voice of the sign and it proved exactly what it was the sign proved that moses had been commissioned by the great i am i could preach 10 000 years to you right there that the signs that are following in your life proves your commission it proves your representation the signs that are following you we say well i ain't got no signs i ain't got no wonders what are you believing in i'm not talking about oil in a hand but i'm talking about producing what this message said that it would produce no i'm not talking about you walking out to somebody that's got a cancer on their nose and speaking of that cancer and that cancer fall off i'm talking to you about a life that'll live all the way throughout the week when the preacher's there when the deacon ain't there when the preacher is there and the preacher ain't there it'll still live those signs are following them that belief but i still believe that there's enough holy ghost on the inside of sister stephanie that if somebody walks up to her at her work and says hey i need prayer i got a headache so bad that it'll beat you every way back it'll hit you so hard that your mama feel it i believe she's got enough holy ghost on the inside of her that she can lay her hands on the stick and the sick be made whole it's not lifting up sister stephanie or the believer it's lifting up the standard you see when you go to lifting up him you watch him come you watch when the enemy comes he'll begin to lift himself up and all of a sudden you get pushed down oh but there's a god that even though the enemy may try to stop you and they try to hinder you there's a god that'll push back he'll push back against doubt he'll push back against unbelief he'll push back against sin he won't leave you down there in the dirt but he'll raise you up are you with me we buried sister sue comer this past week but he made sister sue calmer a promise that i'm going to a place and i'm preparing a mansion for you that where i am you may be also when he looked at mary and martha when they were wondering about it he said i am the resurrection and the life he's not in the replacement business he's in the resurrection business and satan has tried to push you down into the grave but god is here to raise you up kovitz doing its best to stop the children of god you heard by the prayer request tonight that it's it's in our it's in our ranks it's in the message people people that you know you are not you are not exempt from sickness but there's enough god still here in laodicea that's greater than covet that's greater than a headache greater than a fever greater than chills he said greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world some people say well i'm too afraid to lay hands on a sick i'm afraid that i'm taking brother branham's place where in the world did you get that dumb theology at the bible did not say in william branham's name they shall cast out devils it did not say in the name of homer frazier ron spencer donnie reagan they shall cast out devils but in my name they shall lay heads on the sick and they shall recover that's for all the believers that believe [Applause] hallelujah let me behave nah don't let me behave if you've got that calm that kind of dumb theology that'll make you think that we need a prophet here just so we can have a vision the bible said that in the last days i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh your young men shall dream dreams the old men should dream dreams your young men shall see visions it shows to me brother bronzer still is still a young man but we're not trying to take william branham's part we're trying to take our position in the promises of god we're not lifting up a man we're lifting up jesus any time you go to lifting up a man you watch the fall of that kingdom but you watch every time you go to lifting up the name of jesus what does it do it begins to build and it begins to add to the kingdom of god i watch a young boy brother heaven may has come to me and he laid his heart out on the line and he began to rehearse some things to me that there were some things in his life that he wanted fixed who did i think he was trying to do you think he you think i thought that he was trying to impress me absolutely not what was he trying to do it was the spirit of christ on the inside of him lifting up the standard sure you got people out there who watch you watch you because you pray louder watch you because you sing louder that's just your makeup they're not trying to impress you or anybody else that's really got a real spirit of christ on them they're just trying to lift the name of jesus i'm probably one of the loudest people here one of the loudest singers probably but do you think for one minute that i'm trying to out sing brother william absolutely not there is nothing on the inside of a real christian that's trying to lift their own gift real christian trying to lift their own voice lift their own praise they are doing it for the adoration of the kingdom of god now you go and look in numbers chapter 21 i don't want you to go and look at it right now but but you go and read over it later but i want you to go and look down through there numbers chapter 21 and i find it so amazing that here we see when the serpents lifted up on a pole but you watch when the children of israel they they begin to murmur against god and say things against god directly after they vowed a vow to god saying that if you will indeed destroy the king ararat and the canaanites that we will go forth in your name and as soon as they go out and they destroy the canaanites and king arahat they begin to murmur against god and i think are we built out of the same stuff that they are that as soon as god gives us a victory we begin to murmur and complain and they begin to say things against god and god sent down fiery serpents and they begin to bite the people it was a fiery bite and as soon as the bite hit the person they begin to have a fever that's why they call it a fiery serpent that the fire of the venom would roll through their body and cause sickness to run through them and a great host of israel died because of the snakebite all of this was done because of their sin and when they realized what they had done they went to moses and said we have sinned against god and moses began to pray to god and verse 8 numbers 21 the bible said and the lord said unto moses make thee a fiery serpent and set it upon a pole if you look at that word paul in hebrew it means something that's lifted up a standard a signal poem inside a banner a rallying point an ensign that is to be displayed set at a point of paul when it's come to pass that everyone that has bitten when he looketh upon it shall live and moses made a serpent of brass and put it upon a pole and it came to pass that if a serpent had bitten any man when he beheld the serpent of brass he lived now notice the prophet said again god told moses and the type of symbol said go and make a serpent out of brass and put it on a pole now the serpent and the symbol meant sin the serpent represented the serpent from the garden of eden already judged that snake turned from an animal he wasn't a reptile the bible said that he was the most subtle of all the beasts of the field he wasn't a reptile he was a beast and he turned to a serpent on his belly and that snake represented sin judged you see when the serpent began to slip in into the garden of eden what did he do he began to elevate himself he began to lift up his theories and lift up his own ideas and he brought reasoning to eve and because she doubted one word of god is the reason the fall came but god made an eternal atonement again now the bright serpent couldn't pray for anybody he couldn't lay hands on no one he had no hands to lay on but god provided a way for them to look and live it was a symbol it was an ensign in the camp of israel that the god of heaven lived in the camp with israel when they seen a man here that with a snake bite nothing would to make him well and when he looked at the inside with all of his heart and believed the man you see him the next day he was well it was a sign to every israelite that they could look and live when they would walk to the camp and walk by their friends that they knew that they'd been bit and they walked by on the next day and they're completely made whole it was a sign to every one of them that there was an atonement that was made for them that they could look on that brass serpent and they could look and live it was a lifting of an atonement that was an attribute of their sin because of the snake bite god lifted a snake on a pole i know it blows your mind but you look at the contrast of god and you see the serpent from the beginning and you see has god judged that it represented that sin was judged and when you look at jesus hanging on a cross it was the lifting up as an ensign that there was an atonement that was made for your sickness and made for your healing and when they looked at that ensign and they seen that serpent on a pole it was proving to them that they had been forgiven of their sin and that they could be made whole of their snake bite oh hallelujah man is born a woman full of trouble and he's got trouble in his days he's born in sin shaped into iniquity but there is an atonement for all of the sin that's been stacked up against you but this ain't just a one-sided atonement he's not just your savior i needed him as a savior every single one of you whether you want to agree with me or not you needed him as a savior some of you were dirty some of you are rotten some are you with scroungers but thank god hallelujah you've been saved by the grace of god that's one side of the atonement but there's another side of the atonement hallelujah and you have a claim on that atonement that he was bruised for your iniquities he was chastised for your peace hallelujah and by his stripes you are healed it's a two-sided atonement what was it proven he was proving that there was a standard that was lifted up are you with me that they can look at that standard and it took care of the situation you see it was a sign to all the israelites that we can be set free from this there were still serpents out there that even though they got bit are you with me the sign was lifted but it didn't take away the snake bite the snake would still bite them but it was showing them that if you get bit let me preach to you just a minute and some of you lived real good for a while but then you fell back into sin maybe like some person somebody said one time well i've been serving the lord real hard here lately that person went out and got drunk i've been serving real hard here lately so i'm just go out and serve myself for a little bit i want you to know little children that if you're falling you've got an advocate with the father that old serpent's still out there trying to make you fall he's trying to make you sin he's trying to make you lust but if you fall there is still an atonement for you and it's showing that there is an insight to every cancer patient to every covet patient to every ad hit to every covet every drug hit every alcoholic that there is an enzyme that is lifted up now you don't have to stay there no longer but you can go free [Applause] and when jesus was speaking to moses speaking of moses when he was speaking in academias he said that as moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the son of man be lifted up let me leave you with this let the musicians come that if the type would let the people get well how much more would the anti-type do it the brass serpent and a shadow would do it what ought the reality hallelujah part two coming up stand with me this evening see god don't expect you to mold yourself you can say thank you i ain't got to do it sister himba all he requires of me is to resist the devil he's not requiring sarah to make sarah the image of what he's expected you see he snapped a picture of sarah before the foundation of the world and it's been over 6 000 years of the coming of sarah klein you see and he's been building that perfect masterpiece that she would be a complete piece of the master she don't have to make herself live right she don't have to make herself dress right she don't have to wake herself up seven o'clock in the evening if she's taking a nap at six o'clock she'll have to wake herself up at 4 30 in the morning she'll have to wake herself up at five and just begin to beat her head against the wall says sarah you gotta live right today you gotta dress right today what does she do she just lifts up the standard and god lets the standard flow over sister sarah and the standard makes you dress right the standard makes you walk right the standard makes you talk right it's all in the lifting it's all in the lifting that we're in the standard goes to dressing and the bride can say that this dress fits you don't have to cry because maybe you're like that little child forgive me you don't have to cry because you're not like that little child that was there in canada and was crying that day you remember she was crying because there was a great parade and the king was coming down through there the whole school had went out there and she went back the teacher went back to her classroom and she was looking at the children and she counted her children and they weren't all there so there's one missing and she went out there and a little girl was standing out there and she was just crying away she said what are you crying about he said didn't you see the king she says yeah i seen the king well didn't you wave your flag at him yeah i waved my flag to him but the king didn't see me you don't have to cry he's already seen your standard that you're waving before him hallelujah he's already seen that standard that he's put in layout to see it that she would live right that she dressed right brother branham said that you have a living inside that living inside is on the inside of the believer and it's lifting up jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever you'll have to cry he's got his eye on you oh hallelujah god bless you

people oh hallelujah [Music] your name and give glory o glory to your name as they play that this evening i had a story that was shared with me this past week about a an injured man in world war ii that had been been injured in the fight he'd been fighting for his country got hurt and battling he sat there and he knew he knew that the court man was coming the medic was coming to him he just knew that they came they'd always run them they'd run them ditch lines they'd run down through there so he just sat there and he rested short even though i'm shot and even though i'm injured i know that he's coming i know that medic is coming so he came and there was all other all kinds of men that were sitting around him that have been wounded in battle so here comes the medic and he comes and he patches him up the best he can but he was still hurting he was still in pain he was still afflicted and the medic said now i gotta leave i gotta go and take care of everybody else i gotta go fix everybody else but i'll be back you see you see he knew that that medic would return because their standard was that we always come back we always come back though he was there maybe bleeding out or whatever the case might have been knew that that medic would come back but you see that enemy the enemy on the other side was watching for that red flag that was posted that medic banner that was posted on that man that medic they would try to shoot down that man and here he was sitting in that trench waiting for the medic because he knew he would return and sure enough the medic came back because that was their standard that they would always come back and when the medic came back and they began to lift this soldier and they began to lift him up out of that ditch that medic was shot at
