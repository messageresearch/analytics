[40:48] peace and joy is ours
[40:52] even in the dark it is light around us
[40:56] even in the valley we are so blessed
[41:00] amen
[41:02] amen if you will turn with me and i
[41:04] think i've already told you but if
[41:05] you'll turn with me
[41:07] to first samuel chapter 17 and we're
[41:09] going to catch toward the
[41:11] you know this story way way well and i
[41:13] just want to share a few scriptures with
[41:15] you verse 31.
[41:24] and when the words were heard which
[41:26] david spake
[41:29] they rehearsed them before saul
[41:32] and he sent for them
[41:34] and david said to saul let no man's
[41:37] heart
[41:38] fail because of him
[41:41] thy servant will go and fight this
[41:43] philistine
[41:45] and david said and saul said to david
[41:48] thou are not able
[41:50] to go against this full listing to go
[41:53] fight with him
[41:54] for thou art but a youth
[41:57] and he a man of war from his youth
[42:00] and david said unto saul
[42:03] thy servant
[42:04] kept his father's sheep
[42:07] and there came a lion
[42:10] and a bear
[42:11] and took
[42:13] a lion a lamb out of the flock
[42:16] and i went after him
[42:19] and smote him and delivered it out of
[42:22] his mouth and when he arose against me i
[42:26] caught him by his beard and smote him
[42:30] and slew him
[42:33] i want to ask you do you believe this
[42:35] story
[42:36] [Music]
[42:40] thy servant
[42:42] slew both the lion and the bear
[42:46] now notice these next words
[42:49] and this
[42:51] uncircumcisful listing
[42:53] shall be as one of them
[42:57] seeing he hath defiled the armies of the
[42:59] living god and david said moreover the
[43:03] lord that departed me that delivered me
[43:06] out of the the paul of the lion and saw
[43:10] the
[43:11] out of the paul the bear
[43:13] he will deliver me
[43:15] out of the hand of this philistine and
[43:18] saul said unto david go
[43:21] these are next words are powerful and
[43:24] the lord be with thee
[43:27] amen maybe you have needs you'd like to
[43:28] share this morning with
[43:30] the lord just by raising your hands
[43:32] before the lord

[43:36] you're the creator of heavens and earth
[43:38] and i ask you now that you would anoint
[43:40] your servant of the lord you see our
[43:42] situation even as i stand here you're
[43:45] greater than every situation that there

[43:48] i asked you that you would anoint this
[43:50] audience
[43:52] lord may this be the greatest service
[43:54] we've ever been in
[43:56] because we're getting closer to the
[43:58] coming of the lord and we sense your
[44:01] nearness
[44:02] we are very aware of the happenings that
[44:05] are happening around us but they could
[44:07] only happen because we're in this
[44:10] position
[44:11] now we ask you that you would come
[44:14] sweep through this audience
[44:17] lord i remember in in the meetings with
[44:20] brother branham he said come a wind
[44:22] through the audience i heard him just
[44:24] this morning whirlwind coming off of
[44:26] that hill down on that lake
[44:29] that same god's here now
[44:31] i asked you that you would come in a
[44:34] mighty way
[44:35] lord take over our bodies our vessels
[44:38] lord you can heal us standing right here
[44:42] you can heal us sitting in these pews

[44:48] oh god every disease every lost loved
[44:51] one every prodigal that must come home
[44:54] even in the last moments of time
[44:58] lord god and if we are backslidden in
[45:00] our spirit
[45:02] lord as we were challenged last night
[45:05] i ask you for a refilling of the holy

[45:34] i want to speak to you on the spark of
[45:37] creation
[45:42] before i do i'm not going to sing i i
[45:45] don't feel i don't feel to do that this
[45:47] morning but i want to read a couple of
[45:50] scriptures
[45:51] or a couple of verses of a psalm
[45:54] the song says hold to god's unchanging
[45:56] hand
[45:58] the verses said time is filled
[46:02] with swift transition
[46:04] naught of earth unmoved can stand
[46:08] build your hopes on things eternal
[46:11] hold to god's unchanging hand
[46:17] the second verse says it like this and
[46:20] trust in him
[46:22] who will not leave you
[46:26] whatsoever years
[46:29] may bring
[46:32] if my earthly friends forsake and steal
[46:35] more closely
[46:36] to him clean
[46:42] chap verse 3
[46:44] covet not this world's vain riches
[46:48] they so rapidly decay
[46:51] for those of you maybe you have a
[46:53] million dollars
[46:56] in the last weeks
[46:57] 70 000
[46:59] of that's gone
[47:01] because of inflation
[47:03] inflation just eats the money right out
[47:05] from under you
[47:07] it's just gone
[47:08] it's just going
[47:11] covet not this world's vain riches
[47:14] so that rapidly decay
[47:17] seek to gain heavenly
[47:20] treasures
[47:22] they will never
[47:24] pass away
[47:28] verse four
[47:31] when your journey is completed
[47:34] and if to god you have been true
[47:38] fair and bright
[47:40] the home and glory
[47:42] your rapture soul
[47:45] of you
[47:46] amen
[47:48] hold to god's unchanging hand
[47:52] god's unchanging hand
[47:55] hold to god's unchanging hand
[47:58] god's unchanging hand
[48:01] build your hopes on things eternal
[48:06] hold to god's unchanging hand
[48:12] i'm starting this service a bit strange
[48:14] but this is the way i was told to do it
[48:19] a song has been sung here for decades
[48:24] i'm a soldier in the army of the lord
[48:28] i'm a soldier in the army
[48:31] i'm a soldier in the army of the lord
[48:37] verse one
[48:38] i got my war clothes on
[48:41] in god's army
[48:42] of the lord
[48:44] i got my war clothes on
[48:47] in god's army
[48:51] if i die
[48:53] i'm gonna die
[48:55] in the army of the lord
[48:59] if i die
[49:00] i'm gonna die in the army
[49:04] i got my breasts played on in the army
[49:07] of the lord
[49:08] i got my breasts played on in the army
[49:14] i'm gonna fight until i die
[49:18] in the army of the lord
[49:21] i'm going to fight until i die
[49:24] in the army
[49:26] of the lord
[49:28] i'm a soldier
[49:31] i want to say it for all eternity
[49:34] i'm a soldier
[49:37] let it be said
[49:40] you can put it on my gravestone i'm a
[49:42] soldier in the army of the
[49:45] [Applause]
[49:56] lord i get joy when i think about
[50:01] what he's done for me
[50:05] i get joy when i think about
[50:09] what he's done for me
[50:15] today i'm speaking this for you and i
[50:17] don't know how long i'll be if i go over
[50:19] time i'll pay you overtime
[50:24] but this is a result of about two months
[50:27] ago i got a visitation
[50:31] from the angel of the lord
[50:33] and i'm just not going to hold back
[50:35] anymore i don't know i don't know how
[50:37] much time
[50:38] i'm just not going to hold back any more
[50:40] on some of these things
[50:42] some of these things i've held very
[50:43] close to my chest but i feel today to
[50:45] share some things well brother ron i
[50:47] don't believe it well you just go to
[50:49] hell with what your unbelief
[51:01] so i feel very instructed
[51:07] and just for just for beginners
[51:09] in the study when i was
[51:11] studying yesterday
[51:14] i became a very much aware
[51:17] of a special presence
[51:20] that was standing in the room beside of
[51:22] me
[51:29] there's always results from that
[51:31] presence
[51:34] one of the results was
[51:37] brother jason jackson who was a friend
[51:39] of this church
[51:41] had sent me a text just a bit earlier
[51:49] and god just spoke something to me
[51:53] and i just in a couple of lines wrote a
[51:55] text to him
[51:56] and it was absolutely
[51:59] what he needed for what he's went
[52:01] through this last week
[52:04] i don't know and don't feel to share
[52:06] those things
[52:07] but i would say this to you god knows
[52:10] even on the internet
[52:13] that are watching today god knows your
[52:16] needs
[52:21] so because of that visitation i i want
[52:24] to speak some things
[52:26] the other day i was i was blessed with
[52:29] the company
[52:30] that came to our house
[52:33] of course i don't share any of what i'm
[52:35] going to speak
[52:37] and
[52:39] and so
[52:42] brother jason and sister megan
[52:45] brother tom hill brother terry and all
[52:48] of those that was with him
[52:52] he felt to create a gift for me
[52:56] and i have to say this to you this is
[52:58] one of the greatest gifts i've ever got
[53:02] brother jason is a as a new taxidermist
[53:07] and
[53:08] for those that don't know
[53:10] let me just preface this brother jason
[53:12] and sister megan would you just stand
[53:14] just for a moment there i want the world
[53:16] to see you guys
[53:19] just as a reminder and this may be some
[53:21] of these things may be redundant today
[53:23] but just as a reminder
[53:25] jason had decided he didn't like
[53:27] preachers
[53:29] and he didn't want to be in church he
[53:31] wanted nothing to do with it
[53:34] and then true
[53:37] and
[53:38] you know that sister megan
[53:40] for those that was around jason jason
[53:42] was a
[53:44] he was a difficult individual to be
[53:45] around and i'm just going to say that
[53:47] very lightly
[53:49] you can be seen
[53:51] brother ray
[53:53] sister sue
[53:56] i'd asked them to put some heating and
[53:57] air units in my house
[54:00] and
[54:02] he actually asked me said it'd be all
[54:03] right if i bring jason
[54:07] i think we were going to fly to
[54:10] edmonton that day
[54:13] i think we were flying to edmonton if my
[54:15] if i'm right
[54:17] and and so i just but i had just a short
[54:19] time and when they came and they started
[54:21] i went around and stood with them as
[54:23] they started
[54:25] and
[54:26] i asked jason i said would you like to
[54:27] walk through my house i'd like to show
[54:29] you what i'm doing i'd like to tell you
[54:31] what i'm doing
[54:32] and so i took i took jason through the
[54:34] house now remember this is a guy who
[54:35] don't like me
[54:40] and so i walked him through the house
[54:43] and i just began to talk to him about my
[54:46] mission of life
[54:48] my mission of life
[54:50] what i want from my home
[54:52] what i want for this church
[54:54] what i want for my family
[54:57] what this message has meant to me
[55:00] i i didn't pressure him whatsoever in
[55:03] any way
[55:04] but i'll tell you what it did to me
[55:06] changed his life
[55:10] and i'd say every person in this
[55:11] building could say amen
[55:15] amen
[55:16] for this we prayed for
[55:19] for this we prayed for
[55:22] and so
[55:24] maybe we could slip this just a bit
[55:25] closer i'll let you guys do that
[55:35] so we're just going to say maybe a
[55:36] couple months ago six weeks eight eight
[55:39] weeks
[55:42] it just came to me i want to do this for
[55:45] brother ron
[55:48] and so we asked brother terry
[55:51] terry over here
[55:54] to build this cabinet
[55:56] for those of you that don't know terry
[55:58] i'd like for you to spend a little time
[56:00] with terry terry was an orphan child
[56:14] and terry was the one that i asked to
[56:16] come and build my house for me
[56:20] you know how many you don't know how
[56:21] many supernatural days that we had
[56:26] terry klein is the top of my list
[56:29] he's an awesome human being
[56:32] and he built this cabinet
[56:38] and he's
[56:39] they begin to
[56:41] with the idea that we need to
[56:44] we need to have a representation of what
[56:48] this this is
[56:50] the creative word manifested
[56:54] sister megan i think you did this part
[56:58] first of all i think that's phenomenal
[57:02] but you took it from a very interesting
[57:03] place
[57:06] and i thought i thought that was
[57:07] phenomenal
[57:08] brother branham is telling
[57:10] perry greene
[57:11] and sydney jackson
[57:14] at the end of it
[57:16] perry is not sure if he believes a story
[57:19] or not
[57:21] isn't that right
[57:25] and
[57:29] and i wanted to just share these words
[57:34] pray green thought in his heart
[57:38] i'm either listening to a prophet of the
[57:40] god
[57:42] this either happened
[57:45] just as he's telling it
[57:47] or this man is deceiving me
[57:52] and yet
[57:53] he could think of no reason
[57:56] why brother branham would deceive him
[58:00] and he said just in that moment brother
[58:02] branham said
[58:03] brother perry
[58:05] it really happened
[58:10] now you see i'm not going to go through
[58:12] this
[58:13] but brother branham was hunting
[58:15] the year before he killed 34 squirrels
[58:18] and brother branham would only shoot him
[58:20] in the eye
[58:21] for those that know
[58:23] no brother branham he called himself a
[58:25] nervous little
[58:26] little rat at times
[58:28] because he was so
[58:30] he was so nervous and he wanted to shoot
[58:31] him perfectly he was an absolute
[58:33] marksman
[58:34] and so he would want to shoot him in the
[58:36] eye so he didn't destroy any of the meat
[58:40] and he's hunting in a place and he's
[58:42] hunting and
[58:44] there's no squirrel
[58:45] there's just no squirrel
[58:48] and the angel of god that stands on the
[58:51] platform
[58:52] that has met him so many times
[58:56] is now taking him into another realm
[58:59] now this is just not about squirrel
[59:03] it's not just about a 42-inch caribou
[59:07] or a silver-tipped grizzly bear
[59:10] but
[59:11] god is asking him and even
[59:14] challenges his faith and brother branham
[59:17] uses this term and i accepted his
[59:19] challenge
[59:21] and he began to speak
[59:23] hunted all day and he began to speak
[59:25] three squirrels
[59:28] and so what we have here
[59:31] brother tom climbed into tops of trees
[59:33] and i've got pictures and
[59:35] osha would not approve
[59:39] and these are limbs sycamore
[59:43] and locusts
[59:44] also you may not be able to see and
[59:46] maybe we just let everybody see later
[59:49] uh it has corn in here because brother
[59:51] brandon was hunting very near a
[59:52] cornfield
[59:54] but brother brown asked for three
[59:56] squirrels
[59:58] charlie cox was one of the individuals
[1:00:00] that was there
[1:00:02] and
[1:00:04] and brother brown tells charlie the
[1:00:05] story
[1:00:06] actually in one place they have to go
[1:00:08] and hunt hunt down that squirrel and
[1:00:11] they found it
[1:00:12] because it would had climbed in a
[1:00:13] certain spot
[1:00:15] and they asked charlie said what did you
[1:00:17] do with the squirrels he said we ate
[1:00:19] them
[1:00:21] charlie made an interesting statement he
[1:00:23] said those squirrels didn't have
[1:00:26] navels believe better not
[1:00:29] but they were created squirrels
[1:00:33] now i'm going to challenge you
[1:00:36] because you're getting ready
[1:00:38] to step into a rapture
[1:00:44] when we think of third pull or we think
[1:00:46] of a rapturing faith
[1:00:49] we think of these things god has a plan
[1:00:51] for you
[1:00:53] to change your body
[1:00:56] not just make you young again
[1:00:58] but make you new
[1:01:04] when you were at your best
[1:01:07] brother bam said and that was before the
[1:01:09] foundation of the world he took a
[1:01:11] picture of you before the foundation of
[1:01:13] the world
[1:01:17] and and brother jason was telling me of
[1:01:20] his inspiration
[1:01:22] to to do these squirrels
[1:01:26] and he said
[1:01:27] i i write on the inside of the animal i
[1:01:31] i write i write something
[1:01:34] whether it's a deer or whether it's
[1:01:36] whatever
[1:01:38] i just go right through these
[1:01:40] devil you don't have enough
[1:01:50] we will see a complete
[1:01:52] healing
[1:01:55] [Music]
[1:01:56] [Applause]
[1:02:01] trust in me
[1:02:03] i'll use you
[1:02:04] like never before
[1:02:07] and he has
[1:02:15] now i i want to share this and i want to
[1:02:17] leave this here
[1:02:19] if you get bored you can look at it
[1:02:23] but
[1:02:25] when i turned to
[1:02:26] brother jason in the house
[1:02:28] i asked him i said
[1:02:31] what caught what caused you to do this
[1:02:34] he said it just came to me
[1:02:36] and i thought the devil didn't come to
[1:02:39] him
[1:02:42] the sure one thing for sure the devil
[1:02:45] didn't tell him to do this
[1:02:47] for me
[1:02:52] three years ago he would have never gave
[1:02:54] a thought about doing this
[1:02:57] for me
[1:03:00] and may i say that at no cost
[1:03:04] at no cost
[1:03:06] these guys have been working
[1:03:09] and they wanted to be a part of this
[1:03:12] let me just say this to your testimony
[1:03:14] around the world
[1:03:15] god's still in the business
[1:03:19] with the spark of creation in our lives
[1:03:24] and i stood there i i just thought you
[1:03:27] know when i hear a sermon when i hear a
[1:03:30] sermon i want to i want to catch
[1:03:33] what caused that spark of inspiration
[1:03:36] because that spark of inspiration
[1:03:39] is eternal
[1:03:43] are you with me a lot of scriptures a
[1:03:45] lot of quotes a lot of thoughts a lot of
[1:03:47] feeler but what caused the sermon
[1:03:52] if it came from god it's a spark of
[1:03:55] eternal life
[1:03:58] what made michelangelo create moses
[1:04:02] there was a spark
[1:04:05] there was a vision
[1:04:07] and something sent him on a road of 44
[1:04:09] years to work on that
[1:04:13] what caused him to
[1:04:15] paint some of the most beautiful
[1:04:16] pictures in the world all inspiration
[1:04:20] all gifts come from god
[1:04:23] it just is where they're inspired from
[1:04:27] men are inspired from a lot of different
[1:04:29] directions but when it's for god
[1:04:32] whether you realize it or not that's a
[1:04:35] part of eternal life
[1:04:38] i hear brother branham he'd say i was up
[1:04:41] at the house and i was so wore out from
[1:04:43] my travels and
[1:04:45] and i thought of this little church down
[1:04:47] here
[1:04:48] i thought of people you know they're
[1:04:49] having service down there
[1:04:52] i think i'll go i i think i'll go to
[1:04:55] church
[1:04:56] and i came to service to see now you
[1:04:58] know i'm paraphrasing i came to service
[1:05:01] this evening and this morning and i i i
[1:05:04] thought i i thought brother neville
[1:05:06] would be speaking and he asked me to
[1:05:08] speak
[1:05:09] so
[1:05:10] so maybe i'll i'll just
[1:05:12] i'll just pull a scripture and just
[1:05:14] start speaking to you a little while and
[1:05:16] then he would preach a sermon called
[1:05:18] and knoweth it
[1:05:21] one of the greatest sermons ever been
[1:05:24] amen
[1:05:29] you see it's that spark
[1:05:32] that spark that's got life in it
[1:05:39] i'm trying to hold myself together here
[1:05:41] a minute
[1:05:44] i want to share a quote with you i read
[1:05:45] this i sent my family this morning
[1:05:49] and when the son of god
[1:05:52] rises with healing in his wings
[1:05:56] it'll be totally impossible
[1:06:00] to hold those bodies in the ground any
[1:06:03] longer
[1:06:05] they'll come forth in the brightness of
[1:06:08] the son of god
[1:06:11] very nature
[1:06:13] we're getting ready to go into spring it
[1:06:15] don't look like it much around here but
[1:06:17] we're in spring
[1:06:19] the very nature itself
[1:06:21] testifies
[1:06:23] of that
[1:06:29] david was standing there before israel
[1:06:33] a backslidden king
[1:06:35] brothers that were quick to intimidate
[1:06:37] him
[1:06:39] for being daddy's little boy
[1:06:42] an anointed servant of the lord
[1:06:45] not anointed by man or
[1:06:47] not anointed deathly by his brothers
[1:06:50] not even by his father who had forgotten
[1:06:53] him when the prophet came
[1:06:56] but you see he had had fellowship with
[1:06:58] god
[1:06:59] brother branham said that's how god
[1:07:01] learns to trust you it's when he's had
[1:07:03] fellowship with you
[1:07:07] david begins to
[1:07:09] begins to give testimony
[1:07:12] and in the testimony you see
[1:07:15] brother branham would tell stories
[1:07:17] those stories would remind people of how
[1:07:20] great god is
[1:07:22] it would remind them that they would
[1:07:24] have faith for their condition sitting
[1:07:26] there where they are that was just not
[1:07:29] for the temporary audience but that's
[1:07:31] been for audiences around the world
[1:07:34] even today we can rehearse the stories
[1:07:37] like this
[1:07:46] david stands there
[1:07:48] before that king
[1:07:50] that king sees him as a little boy
[1:07:53] that king sees him as a ruddy fella
[1:07:58] no way does he see him as a warrior or a
[1:08:00] champion
[1:08:04] and and david is standing there and he
[1:08:06] begins to
[1:08:08] rehearse doesn't rehearse abraham's
[1:08:11] story
[1:08:13] and he doesn't rehearse moses's story
[1:08:17] he doesn't rehearse the other prophet
[1:08:19] story
[1:08:21] he rehearses his story
[1:08:24] i hear men that want to be critical of
[1:08:26] what i'm getting ready to do today i
[1:08:28] want you to understand
[1:08:30] i can rehearse these stories and not
[1:08:32] have to embellish them because i was
[1:08:34] there and i was an eyewitness of it
[1:08:44] remember when david walks off of the
[1:08:46] hill
[1:08:48] the stones that he pick up near the
[1:08:50] brook
[1:08:51] those stones have been used before
[1:08:55] because there was a war that was
[1:08:56] happening and angels of god rained down
[1:09:01] stones upon the heads of the enemy and
[1:09:04] destroyed thousands upon thousands of
[1:09:06] warriors
[1:09:08] now david a
[1:09:10] ready little boy with a testimony
[1:09:13] that said this uncircumcised philistine
[1:09:18] i want you to just think
[1:09:20] if nobody accepts the challenge
[1:09:24] israel
[1:09:26] is going to be under philistine rule
[1:09:31] and they're going to become slaves and
[1:09:33] men are going to die
[1:09:35] family structures are going to change
[1:09:38] and goliath could stand there and scream
[1:09:41] as long as nobody accepted the challenge
[1:09:45] we've come to rapture hour
[1:09:49] and we've accepted the challenge of
[1:09:51] believing this message with all of our
[1:09:53] hearts
[1:09:56] we're not a bunch of school
[1:09:57] children here we're men and women of god
[1:10:01] that have seen the very creativity of
[1:10:04] what god changed our lives
[1:10:08] these are more than stories this is
[1:10:10] reality
[1:10:14] david picks up a stone we know the story
[1:10:18] that goliath
[1:10:19] swared him and made fun of him
[1:10:22] that's what the devil will do to you
[1:10:25] he'll swear at you and make fun of you
[1:10:28] knowing he's getting ready to die
[1:10:34] david began to whirl a rock
[1:10:38] in a
[1:10:39] in a rope
[1:10:43] some time ago you know this story but
[1:10:45] some time ago brother tom
[1:10:47] hill back here
[1:10:49] he began to
[1:10:51] ask me i want to build a rifle for you
[1:10:54] i want to put brother branno's picture
[1:10:56] on it i i want to have some wonderful
[1:10:58] sayings for you
[1:11:00] and he said i want to do that for you
[1:11:02] and
[1:11:04] honestly i looked up to see how much it
[1:11:06] would be
[1:11:08] i didn't want you spending that kind of
[1:11:09] money
[1:11:11] but he wanted to do it
[1:11:13] he said i want to do it for him he came
[1:11:15] to me over and over again i want to do
[1:11:17] this for you what do you want on it and
[1:11:19] i would never tell him
[1:11:23] one night he walked in just the very
[1:11:26] night that we were going to announce to
[1:11:28] this audience
[1:11:30] that i had cancer
[1:11:32] god chose that very night
[1:11:35] for brother tom to walk through the back
[1:11:37] and have david slink
[1:11:41] today it's worth more than any rifle
[1:11:46] to me it's more than any rifle that you
[1:11:48] could have made brother tom or any
[1:11:50] pictures or any saiyans on it but it it
[1:11:53] means something
[1:11:55] and as i was preparing this sermon over
[1:11:58] the last while i thought about the
[1:12:00] inspiration what put it in his heart
[1:12:04] god in his time and god in his knowledge
[1:12:07] knows exactly what to do how to do it
[1:12:10] every situation
[1:12:13] another man would make this statement he
[1:12:15] says now the crucial moment has come
[1:12:18] now the time has come where i have
[1:12:20] either told the truth
[1:12:23] or it's a falsehood
[1:12:25] and the reason that i know that it's the
[1:12:27] truth
[1:12:28] god's word said it's the truth
[1:12:32] and that just settles it i do not doubt
[1:12:35] one word he said i may not i may not
[1:12:39] have faith to bring to pass the promises
[1:12:42] that he made
[1:12:43] but i would never stand in somebody
[1:12:46] else's way
[1:12:47] who could
[1:12:49] if i couldn't walk like enoch of old
[1:12:52] take a walk in the afternoon and go home
[1:12:55] with god
[1:12:56] i i would be happy to know
[1:12:59] that somebody else had faith enough
[1:13:02] to do it
[1:13:12] the great physician who was here
[1:13:16] who who said these signs shall follow
[1:13:18] them that believe
[1:13:20] if they lay hands on the sick
[1:13:23] they shall recover
[1:13:26] and if you say to this mountain be moved
[1:13:28] and don't doubt in your heart but can
[1:13:30] believe
[1:13:31] if he can create squirrels
[1:13:35] it was already in the sermon
[1:13:38] brother jason
[1:13:41] if he can create squirrels
[1:13:45] who has no way at all
[1:13:47] or nothing there to believe it it's my
[1:13:50] own faith that goes in dust that my
[1:13:53] faith in what he has challenged me to
[1:13:55] ask
[1:13:56] he asked me
[1:13:58] he challenged me to ask it and i
[1:14:00] received his challenge in obedience to
[1:14:03] the word i asked it and it appeared
[1:14:08] god in heaven knows that's the truth
[1:14:18] can he also heal the sick
[1:14:24] if he can lift me with faith up this way
[1:14:28] even for the people
[1:14:32] even if they can't climb to that bracket
[1:14:36] even if they can't do it
[1:14:38] he can use my faith
[1:14:40] and he can lift me up to that place
[1:14:43] and i'm climbing for you
[1:14:46] i'm believing for you
[1:14:48] i'm speaking for you
[1:15:14] it was about 12 years ago
[1:15:17] that brother biscuit was sitting at his
[1:15:19] desk
[1:15:23] i was laying in a hospital
[1:15:27] in a sedated coma where you work brother
[1:15:32] nathanael
[1:15:34] and they had sedated me because i was
[1:15:36] burned my lungs were burned my face was
[1:15:39] burned my arms were burned
[1:15:42] and coincidentally
[1:15:43] because of the cancer and the medicine
[1:15:46] i'm becoming ghost white
[1:15:49] and you can even now
[1:15:50] see you can now see where they put my
[1:15:53] arms the skin off my arms
[1:15:56] the skin from my legs
[1:15:58] to my arms and you can see the stitches
[1:16:01] come here just a moment
[1:16:03] can you see that yeah yeah
[1:16:05] yeah come stand it's not a hard thing to
[1:16:07] do
[1:16:09] can you see that
[1:16:11] yeah
[1:16:12] could you point out it just just there
[1:16:13] for me
[1:16:14] amen amen
[1:16:17] amen thank you
[1:16:23] you see i couldn't see that for
[1:16:26] about 12 years
[1:16:28] but now because of cancer
[1:16:31] stupid devil
[1:16:35] he exposes what god did 12 years ago
[1:16:41] brother biscuit was sitting at his desk
[1:16:45] and something moves him
[1:16:49] i went back and listened to it three
[1:16:50] times to make sure i get some of these
[1:16:52] things right
[1:16:54] he said
[1:16:56] in my human thinking i was thinking
[1:16:58] sister connie will never answer the
[1:17:00] phone
[1:17:02] he didn't know that matthew was in one
[1:17:04] hospital and i was in another hospital
[1:17:08] and he tells sister connie he calls and
[1:17:10] he said while i was dialing
[1:17:13] he said i was thinking she'll never
[1:17:15] answer
[1:17:16] she's not going to be near the phone
[1:17:18] but he said something was telling me
[1:17:20] to call the phone and call sister connie
[1:17:23] and he said i only number he had was our
[1:17:26] home phone at that time
[1:17:27] and he called
[1:17:29] and connie answered the phone
[1:17:32] and he's and he uses this word connie
[1:17:38] i like the way he says it
[1:17:41] connie
[1:17:44] where are you
[1:17:46] i'm between hospitals
[1:17:49] ron's in uva and matthew
[1:17:52] that pulled me out of the fire was an
[1:17:54] rmh
[1:17:59] and begin to talk about the situation he
[1:18:01] said
[1:18:02] it is my understanding that the last to
[1:18:04] go
[1:18:05] is the hearing
[1:18:08] and he said so i would like for you to
[1:18:10] whisper in brother ron's ear
[1:18:13] that we have purchased mount baker bible
[1:18:15] way camp
[1:18:18] and god has told me
[1:18:20] that brother ron is going to be the
[1:18:22] speaker
[1:18:24] next year
[1:18:28] i'm putting the devil on notice today
[1:18:33] i'm tired of playing with his critical
[1:18:35] nonsense
[1:18:38] he's either god or he's not god
[1:18:52] hallelujah
[1:18:55] to god be the glory
[1:19:03] now i want you to just think about this
[1:19:06] here's a seasoned
[1:19:08] minister
[1:19:10] one of the greatest that's ever preached
[1:19:14] that has went around the world over and
[1:19:16] over and over again preaching that this
[1:19:18] message has fulfilled malachi 4 5 and 6
[1:19:22] in revelations 10 7
[1:19:25] and has preached the message of the hour
[1:19:28] and god speaks to him that i'm going to
[1:19:31] be the speaker
[1:19:32] not just to tend
[1:19:35] but i'm going to be the speaker at next
[1:19:38] year's bible way camp
[1:19:42] if you could think about the incredible
[1:19:45] odds of that happening
[1:19:49] how satan stacks odds against you
[1:19:53] and i i'm here to tell you and history
[1:19:55] bears it out that that next year
[1:19:59] my whole family
[1:20:02] went with me to be at that camp even my
[1:20:05] mother and my father
[1:20:07] they celebrated my daddy's birthday
[1:20:10] there
[1:20:11] and i
[1:20:12] i spoke in that meeting till about 11
[1:20:15] 1200 people and god supernaturally
[1:20:20] changed lives all over the building
[1:20:30] i was telling this story at a meeting
[1:20:33] at a convention
[1:20:36] there was a man setting he was sitting
[1:20:38] about right where you are brother jim
[1:20:41] and he was saying that i could tell it
[1:20:43] was just bawling
[1:20:46] it was in my notes so i told it
[1:20:49] and so
[1:20:51] i went to the office
[1:20:54] and this man charged into the office
[1:20:57] i thought of the audacity that this man
[1:21:00] did he just charges into the office he
[1:21:02] was a preacher he charges into the
[1:21:05] office
[1:21:06] and begins to contest the story that i
[1:21:08] just shared with you and i said you
[1:21:11] can't contest
[1:21:12] that it happened
[1:21:17] and then it begins to contest and
[1:21:19] go with that believe the sign nonsense
[1:21:24] and he begins to tell me that all of the
[1:21:26] questions about brother branham and all
[1:21:28] of these things about the finnish boy
[1:21:30] and about the bridge and all of their
[1:21:32] nonsense and about the cloud i said
[1:21:35] it happened just like the prophet said
[1:21:38] [Applause]
[1:21:41] listen he's either of the truth or it's
[1:21:43] a lie
[1:21:44] [Applause]
[1:21:51] well he told it different in different
[1:21:52] places
[1:21:54] in different places
[1:21:56] there were certain pieces that needed to
[1:21:58] be told
[1:22:01] [Music]
[1:22:07] i i said a lot of things to that man
[1:22:11] not beneficial to be spoke here
[1:22:16] i charged him that he would have to face
[1:22:19] god
[1:22:20] with his lies
[1:22:24] every one of those
[1:22:25] that have come against the message of
[1:22:27] the hour you didn't come against william
[1:22:30] brown ed bischo ron spencer donnie
[1:22:32] reagan tim pruitt you came against god
[1:22:36] [Applause]
[1:22:47] oh i hope they come back god will have
[1:22:49] to override his word to bring him back
[1:22:54] speak plain for a bit
[1:23:05] after the man was done he saw that he
[1:23:07] wasn't going to get nowhere with me
[1:23:09] he turned to walk out and i said just a
[1:23:10] moment i'm going to walk out with you
[1:23:13] i said you see there's two doors that
[1:23:15] we're going to walk out of and we walk
[1:23:17] out of this door
[1:23:18] and then we're going to walk out of that
[1:23:20] door
[1:23:21] and there's going to be a line of
[1:23:22] preachers standing there and there's a a
[1:23:25] professional photographer is going to
[1:23:27] take our picture and he just kind of
[1:23:29] whirled like this said how do you know
[1:23:31] that and i said same way i know this is
[1:23:34] true
[1:23:37] we walked out of that door and we walked
[1:23:39] out of another door and there was about
[1:23:41] 10 preachers standing there and it was a
[1:23:43] photographer with a huge
[1:23:45] huge camera in his and i said hey you
[1:23:48] stand beside me
[1:23:55] you see we know where we stand
[1:23:59] we know where we stand at let me just
[1:24:02] say we're worthy of rapture
[1:24:08] we either know where we stand or where
[1:24:10] we're not standing and this altar is
[1:24:12] open if you don't know
[1:24:15] that you know
[1:24:17] that you know
[1:24:18] that you know that there's nothing here
[1:24:21] in this world can hold you here
[1:24:24] nothing
[1:24:31] nothing
[1:24:32] can hold me
[1:24:44] hallelujah
[1:24:52] we're getting ready to go to louisiana
[1:24:57] louisiana's been a special place for me
[1:24:59] i got a probably my closest friend
[1:25:03] his brother tim pruitt
[1:25:05] got many close friends
[1:25:12] communicate with brother tim every day
[1:25:15] brother donnie's real close to that
[1:25:17] we're not here comparing any of that and
[1:25:19] i'm not trying to cause any feelings
[1:25:21] anywhere
[1:25:23] but you'll know who you are by your
[1:25:25] friends
[1:25:29] some of that closeness has been because
[1:25:31] of the miracles that have happened
[1:25:35] we were in a prayer line
[1:25:38] in one of the meetings
[1:25:40] and as i as i'm in the prayer land i
[1:25:42] turned to brother timothy and i said
[1:25:44] timothy
[1:25:45] where's your sister i i just saw a
[1:25:47] vision
[1:25:48] of drew that couldn't walk
[1:25:50] i just saw a vision of drew walking
[1:25:54] well bethany was just in line just a few
[1:25:56] more people you guys know her well we
[1:25:58] all know the story well
[1:26:01] and so bethany comes through the line
[1:26:03] and she's got a blanket because
[1:26:06] the baby that that uh lydia had just
[1:26:09] gave birth to
[1:26:11] had uh jaundice
[1:26:14] and they
[1:26:15] and so she was bringing the baby
[1:26:18] she was bringing the brave blanket
[1:26:20] through the prayer line and i asked her
[1:26:22] i said
[1:26:24] where's drew
[1:26:26] and she said he's in bed asleep i said
[1:26:29] i've just had a vision of drew walking
[1:26:35] she left the blanket
[1:26:37] we prayed for the blanket and they took
[1:26:39] the blanket and the baby was healed
[1:26:44] they brought drew
[1:26:46] and drew comes and we pray for him and
[1:26:49] you know the story
[1:26:50] it's almost a year later
[1:26:53] nothing happens he's still crawling he's
[1:26:55] still pulling himself across the floor
[1:26:58] and sister and sister uh
[1:27:00] karen
[1:27:02] has suffered a brain bleed and she's
[1:27:04] feeling sorry for herself and she's
[1:27:07] she's going through all the emotions of
[1:27:08] that brain bleed
[1:27:10] and and all of those things
[1:27:13] god's greater than brain bleeds
[1:27:19] and so as
[1:27:21] as she was sitting there she began to
[1:27:23] worship the lord
[1:27:25] and the spirit of the lord came down
[1:27:28] and touched sister karen
[1:27:31] and at the same time little drew
[1:27:35] ran all across that room
[1:27:37] ran all through the house
[1:27:40] that's our god
[1:27:44] [Applause]
[1:27:46] brother gabriel has a special
[1:27:47] relationship with drew
[1:27:50] and drew
[1:27:51] they they talk every week
[1:27:54] and
[1:27:54] drew and gabriel
[1:27:57] have a special relationship
[1:27:59] and let me just say
[1:28:01] gabriel's testimony is as supernatural
[1:28:05] as drew's testimony
[1:28:07] and i want to just link that back
[1:28:10] just a few years ago your life was in
[1:28:12] shambles it was tore all apart but god
[1:28:16] who is rich in mercy
[1:28:18] and on the day before i had brain
[1:28:21] surgery where they removed a tumor that
[1:28:24] big
[1:28:27] brother wayne lawson that preached here
[1:28:29] last week last week
[1:28:31] last week
[1:28:34] and and i i went blind in one side of my
[1:28:37] eyes on both eyes
[1:28:39] and i went to the doctor and they sent
[1:28:41] me to the hospital and they i stayed all
[1:28:43] day
[1:28:44] all day in hospital all evening in the
[1:28:46] hospital and they ran an mri on me about
[1:28:49] 10 30 at night
[1:28:52] and brother nathaniel sister sue came
[1:28:54] and my boys came
[1:28:56] and there was a little little doctor
[1:28:58] that didn't know
[1:28:59] and he walks in he says you have three
[1:29:02] three brain tumors
[1:29:05] you know that just knocked the very
[1:29:08] props out from under me and i would
[1:29:10] spend the rest of that week
[1:29:13] and them trying to shrink those tumors
[1:29:15] to where they could operate it on it
[1:29:18] and dr vastigari vista gary
[1:29:22] investigary
[1:29:24] he operated he he pulled it out he said
[1:29:27] it was just like a volcano it just
[1:29:29] exploded in my brain
[1:29:32] those doctors those doctors are very
[1:29:34] fine doctors i actually see some this
[1:29:36] week
[1:29:37] and they told me that i had about four
[1:29:39] months to live i'd like to say
[1:29:42] it's been a long four months
[1:29:55] but gable it would be worth it
[1:29:58] if you was the only thing that came out
[1:30:00] of it
[1:30:02] you couldn't put your life together
[1:30:07] you're doing everything you could
[1:30:09] you was looking for everything but you
[1:30:11] knew
[1:30:15] you knew you needed him
[1:30:18] and we were in the room there was about
[1:30:20] 30 people there
[1:30:22] and we were in the room
[1:30:23] and all of a sudden
[1:30:25] that room emptied except for you
[1:30:29] and i knew that if that room emptied and
[1:30:32] you were the only one standing there
[1:30:34] there was a reason
[1:30:36] and in the next 10 minutes
[1:30:39] gabriel went from old man to new man
[1:30:44] sarah you didn't want the old one but
[1:30:46] you can enjoy the new one the rest of
[1:30:48] your life
[1:30:50] because it's him
[1:31:04] mariah was at the louisiana camp that
[1:31:06] her hair was gone
[1:31:09] and i don't see sam
[1:31:12] but
[1:31:12] we're working he's working
[1:31:15] maybe you could have him and his
[1:31:16] girlfriend to watch this
[1:31:19] mariah had alcopecia
[1:31:22] and her hair was going
[1:31:25] and she came into that prayer line with
[1:31:27] three bobby pins
[1:31:29] and it's it's on the internet you can
[1:31:31] watch it three bobby pins
[1:31:34] she walks that that print three bobby
[1:31:35] pins
[1:31:36] and she said i believe i'll use these
[1:31:38] again
[1:31:44] alkopitia is not a disease that turns
[1:31:47] around
[1:31:49] it's not natural it doesn't turn around
[1:31:52] no more than i can tell
[1:31:54] brother steve steve i need you to grow
[1:31:56] hair
[1:32:05] and i'm using that for a reason
[1:32:08] because in a few days you'll have a head
[1:32:10] full
[1:32:21] i don't believe that brother ron you
[1:32:22] stay around then the rapture happens you
[1:32:24] look over steve say i remember a service
[1:32:26] brother ron said you're going to have a
[1:32:27] hair full
[1:32:38] sister mariah now has a complete hair
[1:32:41] head full of hair
[1:32:42] and it's beautiful
[1:32:45] because whenever god does something he
[1:32:47] does it really well
[1:32:50] he has his own laboratory
[1:32:52] filled
[1:33:00] we were sitting in the back of the
[1:33:02] building
[1:33:04] and
[1:33:06] andrew and katie couldn't have children
[1:33:10] and we were setting and michael dexter
[1:33:12] was there
[1:33:13] and i said andrew
[1:33:15] i i see now why we're just past the
[1:33:18] prayer line we're just finished with
[1:33:20] that
[1:33:20] i see now why katie can't have children
[1:33:23] it's her womb
[1:33:25] so the next time at home
[1:33:27] when i feel the angel of the lord come i
[1:33:29] want you to come down to the altar and
[1:33:31] we're going to pray for you
[1:33:33] and so i called him i think he was
[1:33:35] working upstairs
[1:33:37] and so you came and we prayed you were
[1:33:39] standing right here and we prayed and i
[1:33:42] prayed
[1:33:43] based on what the angel of the lord told
[1:33:46] me in louisiana
[1:33:50] six weeks later you go to the
[1:33:53] you go to the doctor
[1:33:55] and you're six weeks pregnant
[1:33:59] now her two girls if they'll stand if
[1:34:02] one of them both of them are awake
[1:34:05] there you go allie would you stand
[1:34:07] allium would you stand on the seat so
[1:34:09] that they can capture that
[1:34:12] amen
[1:34:13] she's her father in female form
[1:34:20] [Applause]
[1:34:28] those who know
[1:34:30] know
[1:34:35] you see if you just saw these things a
[1:34:37] couple by chance or have we got time for
[1:34:39] a little bit more
[1:34:42] now
[1:34:44] now this don't just happen to me
[1:34:47] sister joanne and brother tom ray
[1:34:51] were desiring children and they could
[1:34:53] not have them
[1:34:54] they absolutely could not have them it
[1:34:57] was totally impossible for them to have
[1:34:59] them
[1:35:00] and and i don't know the whole story and
[1:35:02] i've heard it before but for
[1:35:05] for brain fog or whatever
[1:35:08] they get a prayer cloth from sydney
[1:35:10] jackson
[1:35:12] and they begin to wear that prayer cloth
[1:35:18] they make that known they get prayer by
[1:35:20] brother biscuit they have brother
[1:35:22] biscuit to pray for them that they'd
[1:35:23] have a child
[1:35:25] and their first child they named him sam
[1:35:30] sam's a prince
[1:35:33] of a man
[1:35:35] and i'm talking about prince
[1:35:39] just for notes this message is filled
[1:35:44] with princes
[1:35:47] and princesses
[1:35:50] that are the very example of the
[1:35:52] embodiment of jesus christ living in
[1:35:55] human flesh
[1:35:58] and their children and their children's
[1:35:59] children
[1:36:00] because this message works
[1:36:04] don't bring me your excuses
[1:36:07] don't bring me your nonsense
[1:36:09] this message works
[1:36:12] and it's a supernatural message
[1:36:14] [Applause]
[1:36:22] they had a boy named
[1:36:24] michael
[1:36:26] and michael is one of the sharpest
[1:36:28] individuals i've ever met
[1:36:30] i mean his brain is he must be brains
[1:36:33] from his waist up because he don't have
[1:36:35] much waste
[1:36:38] some people when they get in the rapture
[1:36:39] they're already going to have
[1:36:41] perfect bodies
[1:36:43] and he happens to be one of those
[1:36:49] michael works in the office of the
[1:36:51] church he works there
[1:36:54] and i'm preaching the convention
[1:37:02] i tell his daddy i said
[1:37:04] tom
[1:37:08] god's calling michael into the ministry
[1:37:12] no
[1:37:14] yeah
[1:37:16] he's ran from it
[1:37:19] we had conversations i said
[1:37:21] i'm just telling you what god god's told
[1:37:24] me
[1:37:27] in a prayer line i was getting very weak
[1:37:33] and i turned i i believe it was john
[1:37:35] andes
[1:37:37] brother tim dodd brother murphy wong was
[1:37:39] standing there brother tom
[1:37:41] they were helping me and others were
[1:37:42] helping
[1:37:44] and i said where's michael ray he's in
[1:37:46] the back of the building i said go get
[1:37:48] him
[1:37:50] god's calling him into the ministry
[1:37:53] now let me just tell you there's a
[1:37:55] there's a great difference between zeal
[1:37:59] and
[1:38:00] calling
[1:38:02] and a lot of people are called by their
[1:38:04] mother their father their sister their
[1:38:06] brother
[1:38:07] or relatives and just because you've got
[1:38:10] zeal don't mean you're called
[1:38:12] and it causes men to shipwreck
[1:38:15] a lot of times young men when they come
[1:38:17] to god and they begin to become real
[1:38:20] dedicated servants of the lord
[1:38:23] because of their zeal
[1:38:25] others will say you're a preacher
[1:38:27] you know that'll sound flattering for a
[1:38:29] bit well you're a preacher
[1:38:32] generally preachers
[1:38:35] will catch whether you're a preacher or
[1:38:36] not
[1:38:39] is that a
[1:38:42] you would rather me tell you no you're
[1:38:44] not called
[1:38:45] yeah
[1:38:46] amen
[1:38:49] because any god called man
[1:38:52] is gonna run from it
[1:38:55] so michael comes up in the up in the
[1:38:58] prayer line
[1:38:59] you know there's just god just does
[1:39:00] things right in front of the whole world
[1:39:03] he don't do it in the corner
[1:39:05] he does it in front of the whole world
[1:39:06] you couldn't orchestrate it any
[1:39:08] different
[1:39:09] and and i begin and i hear the spirit of
[1:39:11] god speaking through tongues through me
[1:39:14] and then telling him that he's called to
[1:39:17] preach this gospel to carry this word
[1:39:20] you know what his words were
[1:39:21] no
[1:39:25] and he's screaming no
[1:39:27] with all of his heart
[1:39:29] kind of like moses standing before a
[1:39:32] bush
[1:39:34] kind of like brother branham explaining
[1:39:36] himself in a cave i can't
[1:39:38] go you know sometimes god just knows how
[1:39:42] to do it and now you can listen to
[1:39:44] michael ray as he preaches across the
[1:39:47] pulpit there in canada and you can see
[1:39:50] no man called him
[1:39:54] ron spitzer didn't call him but god
[1:39:56] ignited that gift on the inside of
[1:40:06] him brother tom i'm sorry i'm using your
[1:40:09] family here for a bit but
[1:40:12] he had a son named joel
[1:40:15] and sister joanne goes to brother
[1:40:17] biscuit
[1:40:19] just before i come for a convention
[1:40:23] and she's desperate
[1:40:25] seth she's desperate
[1:40:28] this boy is living in another place
[1:40:32] this boy is doing his own thing
[1:40:36] this boy thinks he's got the world by
[1:40:38] the tail
[1:40:43] so we go away for a couple of days
[1:40:47] and so we're staying at an apartment
[1:40:52] and i'm sitting with whitney whitney
[1:40:55] and we're watching
[1:40:57] planes land on water
[1:40:59] that don't happen
[1:41:01] in augusta county
[1:41:04] and so i'm i'm sitting watching those
[1:41:06] planes land on water
[1:41:09] it was a neat deal
[1:41:10] i mean it was just neat
[1:41:12] planes ran on water around here they
[1:41:14] fell on a lake
[1:41:17] probably the plane's going to be bigger
[1:41:19] than the lake
[1:41:21] and so we're watching that whitney i've
[1:41:23] got my i've got my feet up on the rail
[1:41:26] i preached the meeting i'm wore out i'm
[1:41:28] just sitting there and something speaks

[1:41:39] i go to the door i'm not wanting to be
[1:41:41] bothered by nobody
[1:41:43] i'm honest with you
[1:41:45] and so i opened the door there's nobody
[1:41:47] standing there and so i i step out the
[1:41:49] door brother shannon
[1:41:51] you know you got a phone call from me
[1:41:55] and i step out of the door
[1:41:58] and here comes joel

[1:42:27] sit on the porch with me i'd love to
[1:42:31] we sat and we watched we watched you

[1:42:35] joel's sitting right beside of me and i
[1:42:37] just start talking to him
[1:42:39] he got quiet
[1:42:42] and the lord just read his life
[1:42:46] just read his life
[1:42:48] amen
[1:42:50] and i told him i said
[1:42:52] you are
[1:42:54] born
[1:42:55] and you have a sign of prosperity on you
[1:42:59] you're like joseph
[1:43:03] and you're going to be blessed in
[1:43:04] everything you do i think you got it too
[1:43:10] really do
[1:43:12] and you're going to be blessed in
[1:43:13] everything you do
[1:43:15] but you're wasting your life
[1:43:21] and he said god just read his whole life
[1:43:24] but just a couple of days before that
[1:43:26] meeting
[1:43:27] joanne goes to her daddy on the street
[1:43:31] and she says i'm praying for joel
[1:43:35] i'm praying for him
[1:43:36] he was born we couldn't have him and now
[1:43:39] the devil's trying to steal him away
[1:43:43] and here we are sitting on a porch and
[1:43:45] her prayers are being answered
[1:43:49] i don't have time to tell you how much
[1:43:51] god has blessed that boy's life
[1:43:54] in the construction field
[1:43:58] where you build hundreds of millions of
[1:44:00] dollar apartments
[1:44:03] and you're the head constructor over it
[1:44:05] all
[1:44:06] and and they move him all over the place
[1:44:09] why
[1:44:10] god came
[1:44:13] and the spark of creation
[1:44:15] literally changed that
[1:44:17] that human's life
[1:44:22] are you with me now
[1:44:25] are you with me what about your life
[1:44:29] what about a god rich in mercy
[1:44:32] for a joe shifflet that has been invited
[1:44:35] to a meeting and god unctions brother
[1:44:38] homer to go out and stand on the porch
[1:44:41] if he don't see you there he won't come
[1:44:43] in
[1:44:47] and one of the pillars of this church
[1:44:50] that cancer cannot defeat
[1:45:04] when he comes across those railroad
[1:45:06] tracks there stands a white-headed man
[1:45:08] standing on the porch
[1:45:10] waiting on him
[1:45:25] it's just okay
[1:45:27] that's okay
[1:45:34] you've met them so it's no need in me
[1:45:36] telling you
[1:45:39] but melody and kelvin
[1:45:42] brother kelly hildebrandt's
[1:45:45] daughter who had lost her husband
[1:45:49] had two boys and they're
[1:45:51] they're young strong boys
[1:45:56] i'm just going to tell the whole story
[1:46:03] she was in a church that was kind of a
[1:46:05] little bit distanced from the message or
[1:46:07] using the message and had her own thing
[1:46:09] going
[1:46:11] and she was making the decision do i
[1:46:13] stay here or do i
[1:46:14] they'll go to my daddy's church
[1:46:22] she never heard her daddy preach
[1:46:25] kelly hildebrant one of my best friends
[1:46:28] she never heard him preach
[1:46:32] first of all i think that's just
[1:46:34] stinking rotten amen
[1:46:36] of any preacher that would prohibit that
[1:46:45] i
[1:46:45] let me just tell you where i was at when
[1:46:47] i got this call
[1:46:49] i was sitting in the tenth floor
[1:46:51] of the ramada inn
[1:46:56] and i was looking at the bridge
[1:46:59] that people want to contest
[1:47:03] say it didn't happen
[1:47:06] so i'm looking at that bridge
[1:47:08] studying for tonight that night service
[1:47:13] and brother kelly calls me and we're in
[1:47:16] a conversation for about 45 minutes and
[1:47:19] i had it on speaker phone and sister
[1:47:21] connie was sitting on the bed listening
[1:47:24] to the conversation
[1:47:26] and at the end of it
[1:47:29] i said brother kelly
[1:47:32] i said when she does what she's going to
[1:47:34] do
[1:47:36] and she comes back to your church
[1:47:39] i'm sitting looking at the bridge that
[1:47:41] is so contested and i'm going to tell
[1:47:43] you something in the name of the lord
[1:47:46] god's going to give her a prince
[1:47:48] of a man
[1:47:53] i call kelly in about three weeks
[1:47:55] brother kelly in about three weeks
[1:47:57] and i said how's things going he said
[1:47:59] you won't believe how things are going
[1:48:04] rama it's happening so fast he said i
[1:48:07] just can't believe how things are going
[1:48:09] he said
[1:48:11] melody's engaged
[1:48:17] not just talking to somebody she's
[1:48:19] engaged
[1:48:22] brother ronnie's a prince of the man
[1:48:24] he's from manitoba
[1:48:30] i reminded him i was looking at the
[1:48:32] bridge and i said we talked about these
[1:48:34] things
[1:48:36] are you getting the point here
[1:48:40] god just amends his word he just says
[1:48:43] okay i'll prove this by this and i'll
[1:48:46] prove this by this and i'll prove this
[1:48:48] by this
[1:48:49] it happened i'll prove this by this
[1:48:52] it's kind of like brother biscuit with
[1:48:54] that finish boy that dead boy
[1:48:58] he he was preaching a meeting and he
[1:49:01] came into contact with a sister
[1:49:04] and that sister's husband was the driver
[1:49:08] of the car
[1:49:10] that killed the boy
[1:49:16] and then brother guido comes here
[1:49:19] and brother guido stands here and he
[1:49:21] says well it happened he said i've been
[1:49:23] there where it happened and he said
[1:49:26] what what people don't know is after
[1:49:28] after the boy was raised back to life
[1:49:31] brother branham goes to the next
[1:49:32] campaign
[1:49:34] he goes to the next meeting
[1:49:37] i i personally think it's a phenomenal
[1:49:39] thing i actually listened to it this
[1:49:41] morning of that boy being raised back to
[1:49:43] life
[1:49:45] brother branham let me just point this
[1:49:47] he said if this boy isn't off of the
[1:49:49] ground in five minutes he said call me a
[1:49:52] false prophet
[1:49:54] then he said you could line up every
[1:49:56] devil in hell and you couldn't stop it
[1:49:59] from happening
[1:50:01] so satan you're listening to the service
[1:50:04] you know it's the truth
[1:50:16] brother guido's children are watching
[1:50:17] this guy just spoke with them earlier
[1:50:19] this morning they're watching the
[1:50:21] service
[1:50:22] and so they know this is the truth
[1:50:25] brother gato comes and tells this and
[1:50:27] here at this audience and he said
[1:50:28] brother branham goes to the next place
[1:50:31] and he said there were 12 rows of
[1:50:32] wheelchairs and cots
[1:50:34] and he said when brother branham walks
[1:50:36] through the door
[1:50:38] he doesn't even get to the pulpit but
[1:50:41] everybody was off of their wheelchairs
[1:50:43] and off of their cots
[1:50:46] satan you couldn't hold that boy down
[1:50:49] then you couldn't hold that audience
[1:50:50] down
[1:50:59] i want to say this to you he can't hold
[1:51:02] us down
[1:51:12] hello
[1:51:26] brother doug hill comes here
[1:51:29] was brought back to life
[1:51:32] how many know that's the truth
[1:51:41] a little boy that's asleep on me right
[1:51:43] now
[1:51:44] i saw him three years
[1:51:46] before he was ever born
[1:51:49] to my daughter that couldn't have
[1:51:50] children and my son-in-law that was
[1:51:53] crushed
[1:51:54] but you can't stop what god's got on his
[1:51:56] plan
[1:52:00] and then god gave them another child and
[1:52:03] that child's name's zoe
[1:52:07] i call her shake and bake
[1:52:14] adena will you stand on your on your

[1:52:29] they had a conversation her and their
[1:52:30] dad had a conversation
[1:52:32] they had a conversation make sure i get
[1:52:34] this right sister sue called me and told
[1:52:36] me they had a conversation they were at
[1:52:38] having dinner and he was away from the
[1:52:40] table and she ordered
[1:52:43] a a diet pep a diet drink
[1:52:46] and
[1:52:47] and brother jonathan came back to the
[1:52:50] table and said
[1:52:51] uh is that is that a you order a soda
[1:52:53] pop
[1:52:56] two two things mean the same same thing
[1:52:59] two different
[1:53:00] kind of things mean the same thing she
[1:53:02] said that's kind of like jesus and god
[1:53:05] they're the same
[1:53:11] god's going to rapture little girls like
[1:53:13] adonia
[1:53:20] hallelujah
[1:53:22] satan whispered in my ear about your
[1:53:24] situation
[1:53:26] this morning
[1:53:29] whispered in my ear how long and i just
[1:53:31] whispered back to him she's already got
[1:53:34] a child in heaven
[1:53:38] isn't that right you lost one that god
[1:53:42] don't lose nothing and so
[1:53:44] standing there waiting on you
[1:53:47] so go tell the devil it's not about time
[1:53:50] and god's got everything
[1:53:55] a god that can take care of squirrels
[1:54:08] i walked through my office the other day
[1:54:12] and these words were spoke to me
[1:54:15] are you doubting the vision
[1:54:21] they're pretty sobering
[1:54:23] i'd be very honest with you
[1:54:25] are you doubting the vision
[1:54:27] and immediately my mind went back to
[1:54:31] bud software
[1:54:34] brother bischoff in a green checkered
[1:54:36] shirt
[1:54:40] i've never seen horns like that
[1:54:43] we don't have those kind of animals that
[1:54:45] color we don't have that kind of color
[1:54:46] here and then they're standing on that
[1:54:48] hill looking across glassing the animal
[1:54:53] and there it lays
[1:54:56] there it's laying in the sunshine
[1:54:58] and he said there he is
[1:55:00] one thing for there he is another thing
[1:55:02] to get him
[1:55:07] brother ma'am said him
[1:55:08] brother bud says you can't go across
[1:55:10] that shell rock it'll start sliding
[1:55:13] and brother brown turns around the
[1:55:14] button he said well that's the way the
[1:55:16] angel told me to go he said i'm going
[1:55:17] with you
[1:55:24] when they're looking at the animal
[1:55:30] you know there they are
[1:55:32] and brother biscuit wasn't aware that he
[1:55:34] was in division
[1:55:37] he was wearing a green checkered shirt
[1:55:40] and the tape measures pulled out
[1:55:43] and blaine had just showed up brother
[1:55:45] bud's son had just showed up
[1:55:48] and his hand went down on that
[1:55:53] on that tape
[1:55:54] and held it just exactly that young hand
[1:55:57] went down on that tape
[1:55:59] and brother biscuit has made this
[1:56:00] statement for years he made it to me he
[1:56:03] made it to others
[1:56:06] he said had it been 42 and a quarter i'd
[1:56:08] have doubted it
[1:56:10] had it been 39 and three quarters i
[1:56:12] would have doubted it he said but when
[1:56:15] it landed it landed exactly on 42 inches
[1:56:21] i just want to say this to you it's
[1:56:23] still 42 inches
[1:56:28] anybody that's killed animals and knows
[1:56:30] that there's horn shrinkage
[1:56:33] from green to dry
[1:56:36] it it's a lot of people shoot an animal
[1:56:38] and it shrinks from the time they get
[1:56:40] out of the stand so the time they go
[1:56:41] down there to get it
[1:56:45] you know that's a truth
[1:56:50] but
[1:56:51] let me just say when god does something
[1:56:53] he does it right
[1:56:56] and then they're walking off of the hill
[1:56:59] and i'm just about done and they're
[1:57:01] walking off of the hill and brother
[1:57:03] branham turns to bud and they're talking
[1:57:05] about before we get back to camp we've
[1:57:08] got to kill that silver tipped grizzly
[1:57:10] bear first of all bud has never seen a
[1:57:12] silver tipped grizzly bear
[1:57:17] never seen one
[1:57:20] and he said i can see for miles brother
[1:57:23] branham
[1:57:24] and brother budd's brother had an
[1:57:27] epileptic condition and brother branham
[1:57:29] prayed for him and god healed him
[1:57:32] and so he's got that faith as an anchor
[1:57:36] and and and brother branham just said he
[1:57:38] said i can see from miles and there's no
[1:57:40] bear
[1:57:41] and brother brandon i'm asking a
[1:57:42] question are you doubting division
[1:57:54] no
[1:57:56] no
[1:57:58] sometimes god challenges us
[1:58:01] i remember standing with brother tim
[1:58:04] pruitt and he's laying his hands on
[1:58:07] bethany she's about to have brooke
[1:58:10] and they've said that brooke is going to
[1:58:12] be
[1:58:12] born deformed you know this
[1:58:15] she's going to be deformed and she's
[1:58:17] going to have itty-bitty legs
[1:58:19] and brother
[1:58:20] tim pruitt says that
[1:58:22] he has saw in a dream that she was
[1:58:25] perfectly well and we're standing in a
[1:58:27] prayer line and i turned to brother tim
[1:58:29] and i said according to your dream
[1:58:32] i said bethany lay your hands on your
[1:58:34] belly
[1:58:35] that baby's going to be perfect
[1:58:38] and little brook is just a beautiful
[1:58:40] baby and she's just all over the place
[1:58:45] 100
[1:58:46] exactly right
[1:58:51] are you with me the other day we walked
[1:58:53] around this building with our little
[1:58:56] buddy right there that couldn't walk
[1:59:02] i want to ask you audience are you
[1:59:04] doubting the vision some way
[1:59:07] that there's going to be a rapture for
[1:59:08] me and you
[1:59:11] god turned abraham and sarah back young
[1:59:14] again
[1:59:15] he put enoch and he not begin to walk
[1:59:18] and he walked right into a rapture
[1:59:22] elijah stepped on a chariot and stepped
[1:59:26] across
[1:59:27] [Music]
[1:59:30] i don't care what the devil whispers in
[1:59:32] your ear
[1:59:36] our eyes
[1:59:38] are going to see these things
[1:59:44] because more than a caribou
[1:59:47] more than a bear
[1:59:52] more than squirrels
[1:59:57] the inspiration that touched him
[1:59:59] to create that
[2:00:03] the inspiration touched you
[2:00:05] to get me david slang
[2:00:08] the inspiration that's got you here this
[2:00:10] morning
[2:00:12] when no doubt the devil give you every
[2:00:14] reason in the world to stay at home
[2:00:18] and you're still here
[2:00:23] i opened the door last week
[2:00:27] and i said i'm going to pray for donny
[2:00:29] and i open the door and donny's walking
[2:00:32] up the steps
[2:00:36] i said come i want to pray for you
[2:00:38] brother donny had been suffering for
[2:00:40] weeks
[2:00:41] even months
[2:00:44] and this week
[2:00:45] they found that he had
[2:00:47] he had
[2:00:48] an infection
[2:00:50] and he gave him antibiotics and he's a
[2:00:52] new man today
[2:00:54] [Applause]
[2:01:04] that's god
[2:01:08] that's god
[2:01:13] i was sitting at zeros
[2:01:18] and i was sitting beside you brother
[2:01:20] denny and sister sean
[2:01:31] and i turned to you and i said i see
[2:01:34] zach in a suit
[2:01:39] and you and him an altar
[2:01:41] and you thought it never happened
[2:01:46] and you were hoping it didn't happen
[2:01:51] but god wanted to do more than put you
[2:01:53] in a suit zach
[2:01:58] you want to change your life
[2:02:01] and for you to be a good husband to her
[2:02:03] first of all he had to change you
[2:02:07] and for him to be a good husband to you
[2:02:10] he had to change him
[2:02:13] and now he wants to do the same thing to
[2:02:15] you
[2:02:38] jason
[2:02:43] i have every one of your letters from
[2:02:44] prison
[2:02:47] everyone
[2:02:49] and everyone i prayed over them
[2:02:56] when i walked out this morning and saw
[2:02:58] you sitting on that back row you've been
[2:03:01] here a while now
[2:03:03] and maybe for others they don't know
[2:03:05] and they don't need to know
[2:03:08] god's not interested in your history
[2:03:11] he's got a blood to take care of that
[2:03:19] he's not interested in what you were
[2:03:22] he knows what you're going to be
[2:03:28] and he all he does is just take us a
[2:03:30] little spark of creativity
[2:03:33] and in just a moment
[2:03:35] he changes your life
[2:03:39] minnie's going to louisiana camp in a
[2:03:41] few days

[2:03:52] but that same god
[2:03:54] that will be there is here right now
[2:03:59] he's here right now
[2:04:02] and maybe you've got situations that
[2:04:04] you're
[2:04:05] you've came to this service
[2:04:07] and you know it looks
[2:04:09] totally impossible
[2:04:15] it's very possible
[2:04:16] amen
[2:04:18] it's absolutely very possible
[2:04:21] it's either the truth or it's not
[2:04:28] it's either the truth or it's not
[2:04:35] it's either the truth or it's not
[2:04:44] i heard a statement this week
[2:04:47] from the woman in purple
[2:04:50] and she said something very prophetic
[2:04:54] she said america
[2:04:57] this is what you voted for
[2:05:03] this is what you voted for
[2:05:05] and i'm reminded of a prophet's words
[2:05:08] this is what america wants
[2:05:11] but i'm going to be very honest with you
[2:05:14] i'm ready to go home
[2:05:19] when i think about those saints i just
[2:05:21] got a picture of ukraine
[2:05:23] and we're helping
[2:05:24] through brother berry coffee
[2:05:26] we're helping with some of those saints
[2:05:28] that
[2:05:29] that are having difficulty with bread
[2:05:31] and water they're not buying cars
[2:05:32] they're not buying homes their homes are
[2:05:34] being destroyed
[2:05:36] but not one believer has been killed
[2:05:39] of all of that
[2:05:52] and they love this message
[2:05:55] as much as you and i do
[2:06:00] they love it
[2:06:02] they're wanting a rapture as much as we
[2:06:05] are
[2:06:07] and out of the flux of it all
[2:06:10] ukraine is invaded and destroyed and
[2:06:12] they'll level that place if they're not
[2:06:14] careful they literally level it
[2:06:17] they're destroying it
[2:06:19] and it drove jews back home
[2:06:22] don't tell me god's not in control of
[2:06:25] every situation
[2:06:29] god knows how to gather 144 000 jews
[2:06:34] god knows how to gather the bride of
[2:06:36] jesus christ
[2:06:38] he is the one that has us sitting here
