[50:59] did such a phenomenal job
[51:02] amen i so appreciate that
[51:06] the lord would work it out to where we
[51:07] could watch it live as well and
[51:09] and uh
[51:11] we thank you for your prayers for us
[51:13] amen
[51:15] last night was awesome
[51:17] i mean just awesome you haven't had a
[51:20] chance to watch that it was awesome last
[51:22] night
[51:24] i would ask you to remember us in prayer
[51:26] this week we have two funerals
[51:29] one for sister carolyn shifflett
[51:31] brother jason's mother
[51:33] and brother shannon's mother and also
[51:35] tanya's mom
[51:38] and uh
[51:39] thank god there's a land beyond the
[51:41] river
[51:43] it was a couple of weeks ago i i got up
[51:45] on a saturday morning and the doctors
[51:47] have seemed to give the boys orders to
[51:50] kind of watch over some things and so
[51:53] i i got up and i got dressed early
[51:56] and connie said where are you going i
[51:58] said
[51:59] i'm going i'm going to visit she said
[52:01] you better tell them boys
[52:03] i said no
[52:05] i got a visit from a higher authority
[52:07] than the boys and so
[52:10] so i went to sister carolyn and brother
[52:13] garland's house and
[52:15] i knocked on the door
[52:17] and they'd had a long night and so they
[52:19] were later getting up and so they came
[52:21] to the door
[52:22] and i was able to sit on the bed with
[52:24] her
[52:25] we talked and she said i prayed you
[52:27] would come
[52:28] and i said i'm here amen
[52:31] so she talked about peace and i let her
[52:34] just talk for a bit
[52:36] and i said you know i said god takes
[52:38] care of our
[52:40] our body a long time ago
[52:43] and all of our mistakes and the blood of
[52:45] jesus christ takes care of all of that
[52:48] you know when the enemy comes to strike
[52:51] death he's very vicious at it
[52:54] and i said no doubt you'll you'll suffer
[52:56] much over the next weeks
[52:58] but i said in those last moments
[53:01] when jesus steps through the door
[53:05] you're gonna know
[53:08] special visitors are coming this room
[53:10] right where i'm at
[53:12] and they'll come and you'll know
[53:14] everything is all right
[53:16] she suffered much over that couple of
[53:18] weeks and
[53:20] extremely much even to where that fluid
[53:22] would come out of her eye sockets and
[53:24] out of her nose
[53:27] but in that last 15 minutes
[53:30] she smiled brother garland said like she
[53:32] had never smiled in her life
[53:35] we believe that special visitors walked
[53:37] in that room and
[53:39] and did a work
[53:41] i thank god there's a land beyond the
[53:43] river
[53:45] never let us forget that this is this is
[53:47] just a very temporary life
[53:50] but nothing can touch us once we're
[53:52] there and so
[53:54] amen i would like for you to remember
[53:55] the family
[53:57] this is a legacy family that goes back
[53:59] from the beginning of this church from
[54:01] sister cyril pendenton
[54:03] to to now
[54:05] and
[54:06] and she
[54:08] i prayed for the altar and she prayed
[54:10] for her children and grandchildren
[54:13] and god answered the prayer
[54:15] and if she could look across the
[54:16] banister of heaven now
[54:18] and she could see her grandchildren
[54:20] sitting here
[54:22] right near the close of the front of
[54:23] this and they love this message with all
[54:25] of their hearts
[54:27] you know i thank god that god answers
[54:29] our prayers
[54:31] even after we're not here
[54:34] generations later he watches over those
[54:37] prayers that have been prayed
[54:39] now you may lose faith sometimes and
[54:41] think god's forgot but god
[54:44] never forgets
[54:47] amen and so we just want to remember
[54:50] them
[54:50] amen amen and then betty flynn's funeral
[54:54] will be on wednesday at two o'clock i'd
[54:57] like for you to remember us in prayer as
[54:58] we go through this
[55:00] then at the end of the week we have a
[55:01] very special wedding
[55:04] and it's a wedding that i believe god
[55:06] ordained and he's watched over and he's
[55:08] protected
[55:10] for for those that uh
[55:14] maybe sometimes don't
[55:16] know the ins and outs of things
[55:18] and maybe even they didn't know the ins
[55:20] and outs of things
[55:23] gabriel was converted on the night that
[55:25] i had my brain surgery the night before
[55:36] i would say it was before covet it was
[55:38] probably 30 to 40 visitors maybe more
[55:40] than that that was there
[55:42] and all of a sudden the room emptied
[55:45] just me and him
[55:48] and i looked over at him and i said you
[55:50] know
[55:52] this room didn't empty for no reason at
[55:54] all i believe you need god
[55:57] and it didn't take but about five
[55:59] minutes of prayer and gabriel spencer
[56:02] became a brand new man
[56:05] and we have witnessed his growth and his
[56:07] miracle
[56:09] and he is
[56:14] he is marrying
[56:16] a princess drop right out of heaven
[56:21] i don't did it hurt when you hit the
[56:23] ground
[56:32] for those that don't know they're having
[56:33] a wedding right under a tree she had
[56:35] been her dream
[56:39] and when brother jerry and sister
[56:41] stephanie came through the prayer line i
[56:44] don't know when that was but months ago
[56:47] they came through the prayer line the
[56:48] angel of the lord spoke and said
[56:51] the reason they picked that place is
[56:53] because that's where the angel stands
[56:55] to watch over your family
[57:13] uh
[57:30] it's okay to shed a tear
[57:37] i believe this morning is going to be
[57:39] very special
[57:48] i was asked friday to be at the hospital
[57:53] but i i i'm a little hard-headed
[57:58] and
[58:01] and i'm not going to go into any details
[58:03] but they wanted me to be there this
[58:04] weekend
[58:06] but the lord had laid a message on my
[58:08] heart
[58:11] and i i knew i had to deliver the
[58:13] message
[58:16] last night when i walked into the office
[58:19] i had a vest
[58:20] on it's called a bone hiring vest
[58:26] and i had never put my hand in the
[58:28] pocket
[58:31] i'm going to speak on
[58:33] ruth and boaz this morning
[58:36] and so when i reached in my pocket
[58:40] i pulled a i pulled a
[58:42] an envelope out of my pocket
[58:44] in my vest
[58:47] and when i pulled it out
[58:49] i've got about 10 of those vests
[58:52] if you buy if you like it you buy you
[58:54] buy 10.
[58:56] and so when i pulled it out i
[58:59] i pulled it out and it said ruth and
[59:01] boaz
[59:03] well it was so spiritual to me i thought
[59:05] i thought william had gave it to me
[59:09] i was just over i was just overwhelmed
[59:12] by it i i i asked
[59:14] are you sure you didn't give me this
[59:16] ruth and boaz and just for confirmation
[59:19] i went home and made sure that it wasn't
[59:20] in none of the other best and so
[59:24] and i stood there and i knew that we
[59:26] were in it for a very supernatural
[59:27] weekend
[59:31] we have a little fella here that i feel
[59:32] led to have prayer
[59:34] i don't know if my strength will hold up
[59:36] through the evening but
[59:37] i i want to pray for him
[59:39] he's at a junction
[59:43] and his name is
[59:44] charlie and he was of a very special
[59:48] evening
[59:49] you see these parents couldn't have
[59:50] children
[59:53] and as i walked
[59:54] as i preached that evening
[59:57] i said no
[59:59] i said because i had a little bit of
[1:00:01] restriction in the service
[1:00:03] i said now the lord may not be able to
[1:00:05] operate out here but he can operate
[1:00:08] behind that curtain
[1:00:10] in that meeting sister
[1:00:14] sister
[1:00:20] no
[1:00:22] she just was killed in a car wreck
[1:00:25] sharnick
[1:00:27] sister charlie could suffer sugar
[1:00:28] diabetes for many many years
[1:00:31] and god healed sister charnock that
[1:00:33] night
[1:00:36] and
[1:00:37] i prayed for a few others but it just
[1:00:38] seemed like things were just not right
[1:00:41] well god heard my my words
[1:00:44] and i walked behind that big curtain on
[1:00:46] that stage
[1:00:48] and i walked by
[1:00:49] caitlyn
[1:00:51] and i walked by her and matthew and
[1:00:53] alden was there to collect me to take me
[1:00:55] to the office and take care of me
[1:00:57] and as i walked by her i turned
[1:01:00] and i felt the angel of the lord
[1:01:02] and i turned and i went back to her and
[1:01:04] i began to pray for her and there were
[1:01:06] some things said then nate we prayed
[1:01:09] with brother nate in them and i said now
[1:01:11] god will give you that child
[1:01:15] do you know that charlie was born
[1:01:17] one year later
[1:01:19] to the date
[1:01:22] if you don't think my god can't put a
[1:01:24] note in a pocket
[1:01:36] and it was in that meeting that brother
[1:01:38] dwayne jackson was called to the
[1:01:40] ministry then in that meeting also
[1:01:43] brother guido vonderbrunt
[1:01:46] was
[1:01:47] was told in that meeting that they told
[1:01:49] a lie on him told him exactly what the
[1:01:51] lie was
[1:01:52] and then told him there was a train
[1:01:54] coming for him
[1:01:57] and it was okay for him to get on and in
[1:01:59] just a couple of months the lord took
[1:02:01] him home
[1:02:02] and just just swept him just right away
[1:02:06] but charlie is a vision
[1:02:09] and he's a physical vision today
[1:02:11] amen and he needs a supernatural touch
[1:02:14] this morning and so
[1:02:17] we are going to pray for him nate native
[1:02:19] you will come with sister caitlin
[1:02:21] amen maybe brother jim and you guys will
[1:02:24] come as well

[1:03:25] christ

[1:03:39] and we thank you for that god has
[1:03:41] doctors he has nurses he has medicine
[1:03:44] and he heals through all of those things

[1:09:13] the lord grant you that
[1:09:16] ye may find rest
[1:09:19] each of you in the house of your husband
[1:09:23] then she kissed them and they lifted up
[1:09:25] their voice and wept
[1:09:27] and they said unto her surely we will
[1:09:30] return with thee unto thy people
[1:09:33] and naomi said turn again my daughters

[1:10:20] that the hand of the lord is gone out
[1:10:22] against me
[1:10:24] and they lifted up their voice and wept
[1:10:26] again
[1:10:27] an
[1:10:28] orphan kissed her mother-in-law
[1:10:32] but
[1:10:33] ruth
[1:10:34] clave unto her
[1:10:37] brother branham said it was a type of
[1:10:38] the denomination
[1:10:40] turning and going back to their gods
[1:10:43] [Music]
[1:10:45] and she said behold my sister is gone
[1:10:48] back and under her people and under her
[1:10:51] gods
[1:10:52] return thou after thy sister-in-law
[1:10:56] and ruth said entreat me not to leave
[1:10:59] thee
[1:10:59] or to return from following after thee
[1:11:03] for whether thou goest i will go
[1:11:06] and whether thou largest i will lodge
[1:11:10] thy people will be my people
[1:11:13] and thy god my god
[1:11:15] were thou diest will i die
[1:11:18] and and there
[1:11:20] will i be buried the lord to do so to me
[1:11:24] and more also if ought but death part
[1:11:29] and and thee and me
[1:11:32] and when she saw that she was
[1:11:34] steadfastly
[1:11:36] minded to go with her
[1:11:39] then she left speaking
[1:11:41] unto her
[1:11:43] you may be seated this morning
[1:11:55] brother brandon says when a man loves a
[1:11:56] woman
[1:11:58] you'll hear this next week
[1:12:05] when a man loves a woman
[1:12:09] and marries her because she's pretty
[1:12:11] there'll come an end to that
[1:12:14] but when a man finds a woman that he
[1:12:16] loves
[1:12:18] he don't know why
[1:12:19] but he loves her and she finds a man
[1:12:23] that she loves no matter what he looks
[1:12:25] like
[1:12:26] that you're part sister's heir
[1:12:30] he loves her
[1:12:31] and she loves him
[1:12:34] that's an eternal mate
[1:12:36] in glory
[1:12:39] death nor nothing else can ever separate
[1:12:42] that
[1:12:43] because they are
[1:12:45] from eternity
[1:12:48] and when they stepped out into the space
[1:12:50] of time and return and will return back
[1:12:53] to eternity
[1:12:54] eternity has dropped down in a body
[1:12:59] and called time and then goes right back
[1:13:02] into eternity again it
[1:13:05] cannot
[1:13:06] perish
[1:13:08] that ought to make you smile
[1:13:10] right there
[1:13:12] scriptures that are very familiar to you
[1:13:14] love is patient and love is kind
[1:13:18] it does not envy it does not boast
[1:13:21] it is not proud it does not dishonor
[1:13:23] others it is not self-seeking and it's
[1:13:26] not easily angered
[1:13:28] and it keeps no record of wrongs
[1:13:31] love is passion
[1:13:33] obsession
[1:13:37] someone that you can't live without
[1:13:41] love is the thing that is always having
[1:13:44] the last word even when those words are
[1:13:48] i'm sorry
[1:13:50] forgive me
[1:13:53] or
[1:13:54] i love you
[1:13:56] no matter what
[1:13:58] love does not make the world go around
[1:14:03] love is what makes the ride worthwhile
[1:14:17] it is love that makes impossible
[1:14:20] possible
[1:14:22] [Music]
[1:14:24] quranic corinthians says do everything
[1:14:28] in love
[1:14:31] now these three things remain faith
[1:14:34] hope
[1:14:35] love
[1:14:37] but the greatest of these
[1:14:39] is love
[1:14:43] so they are no longer two
[1:14:47] but one flesh
[1:14:49] therefore what god has joined together
[1:14:51] let no one
[1:14:53] separate
[1:14:56] god hates divorce
[1:14:59] and over all these virtues
[1:15:02] put on love
[1:15:04] which binds them all together in perfect
[1:15:06] unity
[1:15:09] romans tells us oh no man anything
[1:15:12] except to love each other
[1:15:14] for one who loves another has fulfilled
[1:15:17] of the law
[1:15:21] no matter how old
[1:15:24] you get
[1:15:26] never stop holding hands
[1:15:29] never stop dancing
[1:15:31] never stop saying
[1:15:33] i love you
[1:15:36] now for those of you this morning that
[1:15:38] think that i was preparing for
[1:15:41] gabe and sarah's wedding i was actually
[1:15:44] talking about each of you
[1:15:47] because this morning i want to talk
[1:15:48] about our
[1:15:49] our relationship with christ
[1:15:53] and our marriage to him
[1:15:55] and his covenant that he makes
[1:15:58] we understand that the book of ruth is
[1:16:01] exactly placed exactly right in the
[1:16:03] scriptures
[1:16:04] to many theologians they don't
[1:16:06] understand of even why that this love
[1:16:08] story would be placed here
[1:16:11] but a prophet would come in this end
[1:16:12] time to make it clear
[1:16:14] that this was the redemption chapter
[1:16:18] and they were playing a type of
[1:16:19] redemption
[1:16:21] it would be written in matthew chapter 1
[1:16:24] the book of the generation of jesus
[1:16:27] christ the son of david the son of
[1:16:29] abraham
[1:16:30] abraham beguide isaac
[1:16:33] and isaac begat jacob and jacob beget
[1:16:36] judas
[1:16:37] and his brethren and judas beget feyrez
[1:16:40] and of zara
[1:16:43] of
[1:16:46] taymor and there is beget ezram and
[1:16:50] ezram beget amram
[1:16:52] and amram beget abinadab and abinadab
[1:16:56] begat nasan and nasin
[1:16:59] begat salmone
[1:17:02] and salmon begat boaz
[1:17:07] of rahab
[1:17:11] and boaz bega oh bad
[1:17:14] oh obed
[1:17:16] of ruth
[1:17:21] and obet beget jesse
[1:17:24] and we know jesse beget david
[1:17:28] notice it was not
[1:17:31] the famous ladies of the scriptures that
[1:17:33] are mentioned
[1:17:35] in the generation of jesus christ
[1:17:39] but it was ladies with the history
[1:17:43] it was women that had a past
[1:17:46] it was women that would actually
[1:17:49] because of their
[1:17:52] their past in their lives
[1:17:55] maybe be condemned unto death
[1:17:58] outside of redemption
[1:18:01] but because god predestinated a womb
[1:18:06] through which the seed would come
[1:18:08] forward
[1:18:10] i want you to understand every one of us
[1:18:12] tonight
[1:18:14] this morning
[1:18:15] we are the predestinated creatures of
[1:18:18] god
[1:18:19] not necessarily just of time but of
[1:18:21] eternity
[1:18:24] and god has a plan in every one of our
[1:18:27] lives
[1:18:29] and maybe we don't understand the plan
[1:18:31] maybe we actually argue with the plan
[1:18:33] maybe we would actually in our own human
[1:18:36] in our own human nature would actually
[1:18:39] would actually would have rather went a
[1:18:42] different way but god that is rich in
[1:18:44] mercy
[1:18:46] overrode your free moral agency
[1:18:49] because by the law of election
[1:18:54] the law of election
[1:18:56] he chose you
[1:19:00] when you couldn't choose yourself
[1:19:03] he elected you
[1:19:05] by predestination he elected you
[1:19:10] when you were running another way
[1:19:13] no you wasn't seeking for god god came
[1:19:16] looking for you
[1:19:18] you were in trouble you were in a mess
[1:19:21] but got rich in mercy
[1:19:26] our old book was written and it had a
[1:19:29] lot of a lot of stuff in it
[1:19:32] but god had a land for us god had a
[1:19:36] purpose
[1:19:38] god had a feel for us as well
[1:19:41] understand today that
[1:19:44] ruth
[1:19:46] no doubt could see
[1:19:48] in ruth chapter 1 that there would ever
[1:19:50] be a book written about her
[1:19:53] she had married a man in a family of
[1:19:56] of believers from another nation
[1:20:00] and we can question why that they were
[1:20:02] even there
[1:20:03] because famine had drove them from the
[1:20:06] land
[1:20:07] famine had cost them they went and found
[1:20:09] jobs and they had moved
[1:20:12] they wouldn't understand their purpose
[1:20:14] there
[1:20:15] god will make our permissive we'll work
[1:20:17] out to his perfect will
[1:20:20] and so
[1:20:21] they didn't have to leave
[1:20:23] they didn't have to leave the land of
[1:20:25] promise
[1:20:26] because many people stayed behind and
[1:20:28] god fortified them
[1:20:30] through
[1:20:31] through the the famine and he watched
[1:20:34] over them through the famine
[1:20:36] but here this family moves and they
[1:20:39] they're there and they become craftsmen
[1:20:42] and their their two sons raise up and
[1:20:44] while they're there and they marry they
[1:20:47] marry doc they marry women of that
[1:20:50] nationality they marry women that
[1:20:52] worship other gods they marry women that
[1:20:56] seem to to be a part of that nation
[1:21:02] but in god's great plan he has these two
[1:21:04] girls to marry these two boys
[1:21:08] they will take on a role
[1:21:10] that we can look at now in this
[1:21:12] sea laodicean age
[1:21:14] and we can look at now that they played
[1:21:17] their role and they did exactly what the
[1:21:19] seed on the inside of them said that
[1:21:21] they would do
[1:21:23] when they're when the husband died and
[1:21:25] their
[1:21:25] their husbands died
[1:21:28] the only thing left for naomi
[1:21:31] a type of the orthodox church to go back
[1:21:34] home
[1:21:35] that that's the only thing that she now
[1:21:37] owned is just to go back home there was
[1:21:39] a house there there was a parcel there
[1:21:42] there was property there and there was
[1:21:44] kinsmen that was there that could take
[1:21:46] care of her
[1:21:48] and she tells her daughter-in-laws and
[1:21:50] he's quoted in many marriage ceremonies
[1:21:53] she tells her daughter-in-law's
[1:21:56] go back home
[1:21:58] go back home to be with your families
[1:22:01] go back there
[1:22:03] go stay with your families you i i i'm
[1:22:06] old i i'll never be able to raise up
[1:22:09] i'll never be able to raise up children
[1:22:11] to which under the law that you could
[1:22:13] marry those those boys i i could never i
[1:22:17] could never do that i
[1:22:20] you know i'm getting older i'm not in
[1:22:21] that season of my life and she just she
[1:22:24] begins to kind of urge them to to go
[1:22:27] back
[1:22:28] orpha speaks up
[1:22:32] and she turns
[1:22:35] and she kisses her
[1:22:36] goodbye and she listens to her words and
[1:22:39] she she goes back
[1:22:42] she goes back and even the scripture
[1:22:44] says she goes back to her gods
[1:22:47] now i want you just to notice
[1:22:49] when a person turns back
[1:22:53] they're never mentioned again
[1:22:57] in the outlay of the scriptures their
[1:23:00] choice
[1:23:01] took them out of the plan of god
[1:23:03] [Music]
[1:23:04] now god don't force you to love him
[1:23:09] he don't force you to love him but
[1:23:11] there's something on the inside of you
[1:23:13] [Music]
[1:23:17] god don't make you do anything
[1:23:22] and he plays something on the inside of
[1:23:24] you
[1:23:25] and she goes back
[1:23:28] how many places in the scriptures
[1:23:31] could we bear out this morning
[1:23:33] a people that chose their own way
[1:23:37] and they turned for different reasons in
[1:23:40] life
[1:23:42] and kiss
[1:23:43] the message goodbye
[1:23:47] and whether they realize it or not in
[1:23:49] the great eternity they'll never be
[1:23:52] remembered
[1:23:55] orpha has no plan in the scriptures
[1:23:58] i don't mean to be difficult but i've
[1:24:00] got to just lay some things out here
[1:24:06] but ruth was of a different calling
[1:24:10] and she begins to immediately respond
[1:24:12] i'm going with you
[1:24:15] i'm going with you i don't know what the
[1:24:16] future holds but i'm going with you
[1:24:20] where do you go i'm going where are you
[1:24:22] where you lie down i'm going to lie down
[1:24:24] where you sleep i'm going to sleep
[1:24:27] your people's going to be my people your
[1:24:30] god's going to be my god
[1:24:32] where you die i'm going to die
[1:24:36] listen we made a commitment a long time
[1:24:39] ago
[1:24:41] god's god and we're going to stay here
[1:24:43] with him regardless of the outcome we're
[1:24:47] going to stay with him
[1:25:00] now quickly you might say well preacher
[1:25:02] you're standing there with cancer
[1:25:04] ravaging your body let me just say this
[1:25:06] to you
[1:25:07] god told me if i would trust him
[1:25:10] he would use me like never before
[1:25:13] and god's made promises throughout this
[1:25:15] scriptures that's greater than cancer
[1:25:18] god's greater than blood clots
[1:25:21] god's greater than the issues that i
[1:25:23] fight in my life
[1:25:39] hebrews chapter 11 says it like this
[1:25:44] by faith abraham when he was called to
[1:25:46] go out into a certain place
[1:25:50] which should have to receive for an
[1:25:51] inheritance obeyed
[1:25:55] and he went
[1:25:56] not knowing whether he went
[1:26:00] it's a faith walk yes sir
[1:26:03] i want to just i want to just drop this
[1:26:05] to you
[1:26:06] this is not hollywood
[1:26:13] there's going to be ups and downs in
[1:26:15] your life
[1:26:16] there's going to be discouragement
[1:26:19] there's going to be moments of pain
[1:26:25] there's going to be distress
[1:26:29] but he said i'll never leave you
[1:26:32] i'll never forsake you
[1:26:35] this is generational promises
[1:26:39] we saw the miracle this morning of
[1:26:41] of wesley
[1:26:45] wesley's miracle is generational
[1:26:50] he could have been bound in a wheelchair
[1:26:52] the rest of his life
[1:26:54] he would have been just as loved but you
[1:26:56] see god's got a plan
[1:26:58] [Applause]
[1:26:59] he's a healer he made a way for that
[1:27:02] he made a way for charlie
[1:27:05] he made a way for you
[1:27:06] [Applause]
[1:27:09] and let me just say this to you
[1:27:12] his promises are everlasting
[1:27:18] you hold to your prom those promises
[1:27:21] it's personal
[1:27:22] you'll have a lot of cheerleaders around
[1:27:24] you coaching you and every day i get i
[1:27:28] get new medical advice from
[1:27:30] people all over the all over the world
[1:27:32] from africa to to
[1:27:35] all over america people sending me the
[1:27:37] newest trick and the newest fashion and
[1:27:39] the newest thing to battle cancer
[1:27:42] this works
[1:27:45] this right here works
[1:27:54] doctors are at a spot right now with me
[1:27:57] that
[1:27:58] there's no greater chemo that they can
[1:28:00] they can use on me there they don't have
[1:28:03] any more it's up to god and i'd say
[1:28:06] that's a good spot to come to it's up to
[1:28:09] god
[1:28:12] now the scripture says this that
[1:28:15] by faith he's so adjourned in the land
[1:28:17] of promise
[1:28:18] as in a strange country
[1:28:21] dwelling in tabernacles with isaac
[1:28:24] and jacob
[1:28:26] the heirs of the same promise
[1:28:29] for he looked for a city
[1:28:34] whose builder and maker
[1:28:36] which had foundation whose builder and
[1:28:39] maker is god
[1:28:41] i know you know this but i want to just
[1:28:43] lay some things down
[1:28:45] that land had boundaries to it
[1:28:50] that land had promised to it
[1:28:53] it was in the hands of other people but
[1:28:56] god had given them the land
[1:28:58] and the reason abraham could be so
[1:29:01] strong in faith
[1:29:02] he had met the king of the city
[1:29:07] let me just say that king didn't come to
[1:29:10] all the other kings
[1:29:12] that king didn't come to hundreds and
[1:29:14] thousands of people he sat with that
[1:29:17] king melchizedek
[1:29:19] and looked at him eye to eye
[1:29:23] and only in this day did the messenger
[1:29:25] of the hour after the seals were
[1:29:27] revealed told us who that king was
[1:29:31] that was god in a theophany body that
[1:29:34] came to visit abraham
[1:29:37] and this king could turn abraham and
[1:29:40] sarah back to young people again
[1:29:45] where's all the theologians that had
[1:29:47] missed that laying in the scriptures
[1:29:50] but for the bride of jesus christ
[1:29:52] because you have the same promise that
[1:29:55] same king is among us today
[1:29:57] [Applause]
[1:29:59] and the promise is he's going to turn
[1:30:01] your bodies young again
[1:30:03] [Applause]
[1:30:04] and if we go by the way of the grave by
[1:30:07] faith
[1:30:08] we've got a promise
[1:30:10] that he'll raise us back up
[1:30:12] [Applause]
[1:30:14] not in a sick body
[1:30:17] but a body totally will
[1:30:27] that land would have boundaries
[1:30:30] it would go to a certain river it would
[1:30:32] go to a certain mountain
[1:30:34] it would go to a certain place
[1:30:38] let me just drop here just for a moment
[1:30:41] we're the nation to which hosted the
[1:30:43] prophet of this age
[1:30:49] we have boundaries
[1:30:51] as a nation
[1:30:54] we're supposed to protect those
[1:30:56] boundaries
[1:30:58] we're supposed to
[1:31:02] but today i'm not going to talk about
[1:31:04] the mexico border
[1:31:07] or the north border
[1:31:09] or the oceans
[1:31:12] we were born as a nation
[1:31:15] screaming give me liberty or give me
[1:31:18] death
[1:31:20] we put it in our halls of our congresses
[1:31:23] that we trust in god
[1:31:27] the god
[1:31:28] i hope this gets to our governors
[1:31:32] we made a a promise that this will be a
[1:31:35] godly nation
[1:31:38] we laid out the boundaries that just as
[1:31:40] israel
[1:31:41] as netanyahu
[1:31:43] stood before his council and they they
[1:31:45] were saying that you don't have a title
[1:31:47] deed to the land of israel and he raised
[1:31:50] up the bible
[1:31:52] and he said this is my title deed
[1:31:55] [Applause]
[1:31:57] god gave me this land
[1:32:00] i want to raise the same bible today
[1:32:03] and say god gave us this land
[1:32:06] and every promise in this bible belongs
[1:32:09] to us
[1:32:22] and just as israel has had to fight for
[1:32:24] its boundaries now
[1:32:27] they have to fight for the boundaries
[1:32:30] they have to fight for what god has
[1:32:32] given us
[1:32:33] let me just say you have to fight
[1:32:42] let me just say this publicly
[1:32:44] weak pulpits
[1:32:49] are guilty of taking this bible
[1:32:54] and it's no longer welcome in the halls
[1:32:56] of congress
[1:32:58] the ten commandments is not welcomed in
[1:33:00] our judicial system
[1:33:15] i have a phone message
[1:33:19] came to us yesterday the day before
[1:33:20] yesterday of of a pastor that you know
[1:33:23] as a boy
[1:33:25] robert marrario
[1:33:27] he came here and preached for us he
[1:33:28] preached for my father
[1:33:31] and he's screaming for help from
[1:33:33] preachers and
[1:33:34] people around the world to pray for them
[1:33:36] as a body of believers
[1:33:38] several body believers in new york

[1:33:46] lay out his burden
[1:33:47] i'm not going to play it to you this
[1:33:49] morning but
[1:33:51] that's not my my point
[1:33:54] but we want to pray for him
[1:33:56] he says because of the democratic
[1:33:58] governor
[1:34:00] that they are now
[1:34:01] taking 40 percent of the police force
[1:34:05] away this weekend
[1:34:07] they're gone
[1:34:08] and he says our streets
[1:34:12] are now wicked
[1:34:18] he said our northern cities are now
[1:34:20] becoming so polluted
[1:34:23] and he wants us to pray where do we move
[1:34:25] where do we go i want to tell him where
[1:34:27] to go
[1:34:29] into this promised land
[1:34:32] because what's going on in new york is
[1:34:34] coming to grottos and elkton

[1:34:40] in china came to us
[1:34:43] the sin that was in sodom in san
[1:34:46] francisco came to virginia

[1:34:53] well we're going to be here for hundreds
[1:34:55] of more years i got news for you nations
[1:34:58] are

[1:35:27] i was asked last year to become involved
[1:35:29] in the government
[1:35:32] you don't know this
[1:35:34] but i was asked last year to become
[1:35:36] involved in as an advisor
[1:35:40] to one of our senators and become one of
[1:35:42] his personal advisors
[1:35:45] and i just wrote him back and said i'm
[1:35:47] sorry
[1:35:48] i've got a bigger job than that
[1:35:53] so i'm going to give a little advice
[1:35:54] this morning
[1:35:59] i'm going to give a little advice this
[1:36:01] morning
[1:36:02] when you sell your borders out
[1:36:07] expect the enemy to come in
[1:36:12] amen
[1:36:14] brother branham stood and preached a
[1:36:16] sermon called warning
[1:36:18] then judgment
[1:36:21] and the reason america is in the place
[1:36:23] that she is today is because she had an
[1:36:27] opportunity
[1:36:31] just like other generations had an
[1:36:33] opportunity
[1:36:36] at receiving the message
[1:36:38] whether it was wesley
[1:36:40] whether it was martin luther
[1:36:43] or whether it was william branham
[1:36:46] but they turned down the message
[1:36:50] and when you turn down the warning from
[1:36:52] god
[1:36:55] i'm going to need something more
[1:36:56] concrete brother ron
[1:36:58] noah stood and preached 120 years
[1:37:02] god is a very patient god
[1:37:06] don't you blame god
[1:37:09] don't you blame god for the condition
[1:37:11] america is in
[1:37:13] god gave her a warning
[1:37:17] she would never have needed a hospital
[1:37:22] gonna preach to you
[1:37:23] she'd have never needed the
[1:37:25] manufacturing facility even to take care
[1:37:27] of the clothes
[1:37:30] you wouldn't have needed a police
[1:37:32] department
[1:37:33] [Applause]
[1:37:36] i need proof brother ron i'll give it to
[1:37:38] you moses went through the wilderness 40
[1:37:41] years
[1:37:43] and god provided water for him in a
[1:37:45] desert
[1:37:46] he provided food for them for 40 years
[1:37:49] they never hunted they never fished god
[1:37:52] provided the soles of their shoes never
[1:37:55] wore out the threads of their clothes
[1:37:57] never wore out
[1:37:59] [Applause]
[1:38:00] they never built a hospital in the whole
[1:38:03] time
[1:38:04] that's our god
[1:38:07] [Applause]
[1:38:26] brother brahma said i want to post the
[1:38:28] church on where you're at
[1:38:30] so i'm going to post you on where you're
[1:38:32] at
[1:38:34] this week
[1:38:37] not five years ago
[1:38:40] not 30 years ago
[1:38:42] in the last seven days
[1:38:47] since william spoke
[1:38:50] our president were you lacking you don't
[1:38:52] lack him he's still your president
[1:38:57] shook hands
[1:38:59] with the pope
[1:39:03] and the pope
[1:39:05] reestablished that he could have
[1:39:07] communion
[1:39:08] it made a lot of priests even across
[1:39:10] america upset
[1:39:12] but listen there's a greater force at
[1:39:14] work
[1:39:16] [Music]
[1:39:18] and this pope
[1:39:19] made statements this week that he will
[1:39:21] be the first pope to exercise political
[1:39:26] power
[1:39:30] on the footprint of climate change
[1:39:34] i want to tell you the climate is
[1:39:36] changing
[1:39:38] and i'm not talking about hot and coal
[1:39:46] they are establishing even this week
[1:39:49] that there will come world taxes
[1:39:52] to which that he will oversee
[1:40:00] brother branham predicted and
[1:40:02] i know people made fun of it but brother
[1:40:04] brown predicted that we would get a
[1:40:05] woman rise in america
[1:40:08] the president could be rome could be a
[1:40:11] vice president
[1:40:12] should stand in purple
[1:40:14] well that took place
[1:40:17] you don't have to argue about that that
[1:40:19] took place
[1:40:20] make fun of you you want to it's kind of
[1:40:22] like making fun of an arc
[1:40:28] you know these people that get on the
[1:40:30] internet and make all kind of fun of the
[1:40:31] message it's those kind of people that
[1:40:34] were that were standing outside of the
[1:40:36] ark
[1:40:37] making fun but you know when they became
[1:40:39] believers when the water
[1:40:42] [Applause]
[1:40:54] brother ron pray for my loved ones that
[1:40:55] did that oh no
[1:40:58] i took my hands off of them according to
[1:41:00] the scriptures a long time ago
[1:41:03] they'll be believers when me and you are
[1:41:05] not not here anymore
[1:41:10] when i ain't able to you won't be making
[1:41:12] fun of me
[1:41:13] or andrew or these other ministers that
[1:41:16] are still proclaiming the banner of the
[1:41:18] message of the hour
[1:41:20] you can call us god
[1:41:42] sometimes a handshake is more than a
[1:41:43] handshake
[1:41:46] billy graham made that handshake
[1:41:49] many years ago
[1:41:51] our prophet refused that handshake
[1:41:57] brother branham was standing on one side
[1:41:59] of the door and the pope was on the
[1:42:01] other and brother branham was given
[1:42:02] instructions that you'll have to bow and
[1:42:05] kiss his ring
[1:42:07] and he said i'll not call no man father
[1:42:09] except for my lord jesus christ
[1:42:12] and i'll not worship another man
[1:42:16] and i'll knock kiss another's ring
[1:42:23] and he turned away from that
[1:42:29] i want to remind you that we're not a
[1:42:30] christian nation anymore
[1:42:35] in our supreme court
[1:42:38] we have all but one
[1:42:40] is catholic
[1:42:45] so we are a catholic nation
[1:42:48] we have a president that's catholic
[1:42:52] and he's an active catholic
[1:42:56] don't you republicans get too too
[1:42:58] relaxed
[1:43:02] because your fox news announcers
[1:43:06] are over 90
[1:43:07] catholic
[1:43:08] and pay homage to that
[1:43:12] you see regardless of the pulpits of
[1:43:15] today because of the weaknesses of the
[1:43:17] pulpits
[1:43:19] they have forgot to proclaim that she's
[1:43:22] still the mother of harlots
[1:43:26] and the daughters
[1:43:28] that are the denominational system that
[1:43:30] are tied to her through the umbilical
[1:43:32] cord of father son holy ghost baptism
[1:43:40] or her daughters
[1:43:45] you see i'm speaking on boundaries here
[1:43:47] for a little while i'll not get too hard
[1:43:49] to ruth and boaz but i'm speaking on
[1:43:52] boundaries because they're important
[1:43:54] america forgot our boundaries
[1:43:58] and we can stand and scream about
[1:44:00] american we love her and we love her
[1:44:03] and i'm thankful for america today i
[1:44:06] stand with her in her glory and i stand
[1:44:08] with her in her nonsense
[1:44:11] she's still she's still amongst the
[1:44:13] greatest
[1:44:15] but she's turned down
[1:44:17] the message
[1:44:22] she forgot her boundaries
[1:44:24] [Music]
[1:44:26] she forgot her boundaries
[1:44:30] i i understand people wanting to come to
[1:44:32] america because it's a better land
[1:44:34] i understand you want to stay here
[1:44:36] because it's a good land
[1:44:38] america if you
[1:44:40] still up to right now you can work and
[1:44:42] provide for yourself
[1:44:45] it won't be that way much longer but you
[1:44:47] can still provide for yourself
[1:44:49] it's going to change shortly
[1:44:51] we're becoming a socialist nation
[1:44:55] because it has to be that way for the
[1:44:58] tribulation period
[1:45:00] you see scripture's got to be fulfilled
[1:45:04] and it's got to be that way
[1:45:08] don't send me new emails and don't send
[1:45:10] me new text if you're mad at me
[1:45:12] because i could care less
[1:45:22] what i'm not concerned about is
[1:45:24] i'm not concerned
[1:45:26] i truly am concerned about america's
[1:45:28] borders
[1:45:30] i am concerned that she's went the way
[1:45:31] that she has
[1:45:34] but i'm really concerned about people
[1:45:40] i'm concerned about the borders at your
[1:45:41] land
[1:45:45] i'm caught i'm concerned about the
[1:45:46] borders of your family now i want you to
[1:45:48] be attentive with me
[1:45:51] i'm concerned about what we let in our
[1:45:53] homes
[1:45:55] what we entertain ourselves with the
[1:45:58] communication and
[1:46:00] and the things that take place
[1:46:02] i'm concerned about prayer lives
[1:46:05] i'm concerned about how much we read our
[1:46:07] bible and draw from the source
[1:46:10] i'm concerned about how much we listen
[1:46:12] to the message of the hour or have we
[1:46:14] let brother branham become a stranger to
[1:46:16] our home
[1:46:18] i'm concerned about have we allowed the
[1:46:20] message to become entertainment
[1:46:27] but have we let too many enemy
[1:46:29] infiltrate the land
[1:46:31] and contaminate our wells
[1:46:40] i want to say one words to you re-secure
[1:46:43] your border
[1:46:49] re-secure your border
[1:46:53] they ought to see us here
[1:46:56] they ought to see us
[1:46:58] to the point to where god throwed up on
[1:47:01] it
[1:47:02] do you want another term puked on this
[1:47:04] age
[1:47:05] it became an age to where that is so
[1:47:09] sodom
[1:47:12] he's not welcome here no more
[1:47:19] i've said this before in that be an
[1:47:21] appropriate spot
[1:47:23] if you don't think
[1:47:24] that america has turned away from the
[1:47:26] message then invite
[1:47:30] brother branham
[1:47:32] [Music]
[1:47:37] brother ryan's not going to come back
[1:47:38] and have a ministry
[1:47:40] contrary to a lot of people's thoughts
[1:47:43] but
[1:47:44] invite the
[1:47:45] the best of the best of the message to
[1:47:48] go speak in your huge cathedrals
[1:47:55] they won't allow that to happen
[1:48:01] but you can sing songs of worship
[1:48:04] and move massive congregations with with
[1:48:07] this new age worship
[1:48:14] and people love to worship
[1:48:18] but allow one of these ministers to
[1:48:20] stand in the pulpit and preach straight
[1:48:25] come on brother
[1:48:27] just preach straight
[1:48:30] he won't be there long
[1:48:35] why brother ron are you preaching like
[1:48:36] this because the borders have been
[1:48:39] infiltrated
[1:48:41] brother branham preached another sermon
[1:48:43] and i want to drop right here the
[1:48:45] invasion of the united states
[1:48:49] brother brown said they could take this
[1:48:51] nation without firing a shot and they
[1:48:53] have proved that they did it
[1:49:10] israel always got in trouble when it
[1:49:12] left its homeland
[1:49:15] that's where your promises are
[1:49:19] that's where we will get in trouble
[1:49:22] when we leave the promises of the bible
[1:49:27] the borders of the bible
[1:49:30] let me just say this to you even with
[1:49:31] the message of the hour you may not
[1:49:33] understand it
[1:49:34] but don't you throw rocks at it
[1:49:42] i want you to understand as i go into
[1:49:44] this just for a moment and i won't get
[1:49:46] done because i'm just about finished
[1:49:49] with this part
[1:49:54] the only land of redemption
[1:49:58] for ruth
[1:50:00] was in boaz's field
[1:50:05] there was a lot of fields
[1:50:09] there was a lot of men of great wealth
[1:50:13] she actually even had a nearer kinsmen
[1:50:17] to her
[1:50:19] but naomi's instructions was to go to
[1:50:22] boaz's field
[1:50:28] let me just read a part of a quote and i
[1:50:30] may read it all to you next time
[1:50:32] the great heart at rahab
[1:50:35] become a believer i look at her history
[1:50:39] here not long ago and she was considered
[1:50:42] brought into the faith because of her
[1:50:44] belief in god she was brought into the
[1:50:47] israeli israelite
[1:50:51] a faith
[1:50:51] alight
[1:50:53] she courted a general in the army an
[1:50:56] israelite army
[1:50:58] watch what god did for that woman
[1:51:03] they moved to bethlehem
[1:51:06] and they had a son and his and that son
[1:51:09] was
[1:51:10] they called him
[1:51:11] boaz
[1:51:16] and out of boaz
[1:51:18] he
[1:51:19] married ruth
[1:51:22] can i drop this to you now god's been
[1:51:25] working on you for generations
[1:51:29] way before you ever arrived he prepared
[1:51:32] for you
[1:51:40] he prepared for you
[1:51:44] yes sir
[1:51:47] rahab
[1:51:48] entertained two strangers
[1:51:52] and her job because of circumstances of
[1:51:54] life was to be a harlot
[1:51:57] and she entertained a lot of men
[1:51:59] but these days she entertained the
[1:52:01] message of the hour
[1:52:04] and he got a covenant with him
[1:52:07] she said your god is god
[1:52:10] she had a lot of gods that she could
[1:52:11] serve but your god is the only true god
[1:52:16] i have protected you i want you to
[1:52:18] protect me
[1:52:19] let down a scarlet rope
[1:52:23] on the wall
[1:52:25] the most protected city
[1:52:27] that was the gateway to the promised
[1:52:30] land
[1:52:32] i want you to think about the children
[1:52:34] of of abraham as they move across this
[1:52:37] land and begin to take their land the
[1:52:39] first city is jericho
[1:52:42] the most fortified city that there was
[1:52:46] everybody would perish but one
[1:52:49] family
[1:52:52] brother ron
[1:52:54] the way you preach
[1:52:56] it is let me just say this dude don't
[1:52:58] find these sermons difficult find grace
[1:53:01] in this
[1:53:03] [Music]
[1:53:05] don't find this difficult god bypassed a
[1:53:07] million and chose you
[1:53:13] what about my brother what about my
[1:53:15] sister what about my mother it's up to
[1:53:17] god
[1:53:20] but don't you for a second overlook the
[1:53:23] grace of god
[1:53:24] for your opportunity
[1:53:27] [Applause]
[1:53:37] it's a
[1:53:40] it's a strange way to fight a war
[1:53:44] to march around a city without saying a
[1:53:46] word
[1:53:47] and you do it for days
[1:53:50] you do it for days
[1:53:52] but on that last day
[1:53:54] when you march you scream
[1:53:57] we're gonna sound trumpets
[1:53:59] and it wasn't the vibration of the sound
[1:54:02] of their voices it was god was
[1:54:04] confirming a promise
[1:54:07] and those walls that chariot races could
[1:54:10] be run on one of the greatest armies
[1:54:12] that there ever been was behind those
[1:54:15] walls
[1:54:17] they begin to crumble
[1:54:19] let me just say satan's kingdom is
[1:54:22] crumbling
[1:54:24] it's falling down
[1:54:27] it's coming to its end
[1:54:29] at the sound of this void
[1:54:42] let it crumble
[1:54:43] [Applause]
[1:54:45] let it crumble in your life
[1:54:48] let it strongholds crumble in your life
[1:54:53] and walk a brand new day
[1:54:56] stay in the field
[1:54:58] stay in the field let's stand to our
[1:55:00] feet this morning
[1:55:02] god bless you
[1:55:05] god bless you
[1:55:07] god bless you
[1:55:10] hallelujah
[1:55:12] amen
[1:55:14] i love you
[1:55:19] i want to say this to you each and every
[1:55:21] one of you
[1:55:24] you're worth fighting for
[1:55:30] you're worth fighting for
[1:55:35] thank god for a prophet that would stand
[1:55:36] in pulpits all across america all
[1:55:38] through canada
[1:55:40] mexico around the world
[1:55:43] and he would stand there and he would
[1:55:44] come with his little bible
[1:55:46] maybe 26 pages of notes
[1:55:49] and he walked to the pulpit
[1:55:52] good evening friends
[1:55:56] good evening
[1:56:04] and just the presence of that angel
[1:56:07] would cause conviction to go all across
[1:56:09] that audience
[1:56:12] people would get healed miracles would
[1:56:15] happen
[1:56:16] people's lives would be changed
[1:56:18] but after you get away from the
[1:56:20] influence of the light you go right back
[1:56:22] to what you were
[1:56:23] you got to stay in the field
[1:56:27] you gotta stay in the field
[1:56:29] how quickly can you you leave the field
[1:56:31] and before long you start dressing like
[1:56:34] the world and acting like the world and
[1:56:36] have the habits of the world and
[1:56:37] actually get worse than what you were
[1:56:39] before
[1:56:42] it's like i told a young man that he
[1:56:44] told me he said i'll never be like other
[1:56:46] people
[1:56:47] i said
[1:56:48] let me just give you just a bit of
[1:56:50] instruction
[1:56:51] because you may not know this
[1:56:54] the the
[1:56:55] the scripture says that once you leave
[1:57:01] the first enemy comes back to see if
[1:57:03] you're full
[1:57:04] of the holy ghost
[1:57:07] and that first enemy opens up the door
[1:57:10] and then he holds the door open
[1:57:13] for seven more
[1:57:16] much worse than himself
[1:57:19] that's why you see people walk away
[1:57:23] the first enemy you may be able to
