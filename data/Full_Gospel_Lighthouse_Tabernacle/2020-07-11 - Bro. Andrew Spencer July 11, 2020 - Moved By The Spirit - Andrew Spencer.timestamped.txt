[51:13] Tabernacle we greet you with the love of
[51:16] Christ we give special greetings to our
[51:19] precious friend brother Ron Spencer his
[51:22] dear wife sister Connie and then the
[51:26] children Andrew and Matthew and Whitney
[51:29] and their families and now to also all
[51:32] of you that have gathered together and
[51:35] had been so faithful in supporting all
[51:38] these years this weekend represents a
[51:41] unique opportunity for us to join
[51:44] together in a wonderful and unique way
[51:47] the seeds of this have been sown many
[51:49] years ago when brother Ron
[51:51] became a part of our annual July
[51:55] meetings we cannot even begin to tell
[51:58] you of all the the wonderful things that
[52:01] God has accomplished in the many years
[52:04] that we have come together and brother
[52:06] Ron has ministered for us only eternity
[52:10] will tell so for you that have supported
[52:14] him and sent him in prayer we thank you
[52:16] and then it was some years ago that God
[52:19] added another part to this when brother
[52:21] Andrew came and ministered alongside
[52:23] brother Ron how we appreciate it
[52:26] God using him subsequently he's come and
[52:30] ministered a graduation for us and been
[52:33] a blessing to us showing that the call
[52:36] of God is even greater than a family
[52:38] time we appreciate brother Andrew as
[52:41] well as a result of this relationship
[52:44] brother Ron has held a special place in
[52:48] our heart
[52:48] he has been ordained of God for such a
[52:52] hour even as this we have been with you
[52:56] in the year in the time of trial these
[52:59] last months no I would like to let you
[53:03] know that even while you have been under
[53:06] great burden there have been a group of
[53:08] believers in Edmonton that have been
[53:09] continually praying and supporting you
[53:12] and bringing you all before the throne
[53:15] of grace we are here in 2020 seemingly
[53:21] bound by borders restrictions and the
[53:27] constraints that have been put on the
[53:28] world as a whole for many this has
[53:31] become a new way of life the world
[53:34] seemingly has been put on hold
[53:37] economies have been put on hold and it
[53:40] seems that the devil wants to put God on
[53:42] hold well I'd like to say God has never
[53:45] been stopped by anything the devil has
[53:48] ever done and the program of God is
[53:51] moving on he is still moving in the
[53:54] hearts of his people and he is rising to
[53:57] show his glory I believe in a greater
[54:00] way than ever before so the restriction
[54:03] that have seemingly limited the
[54:05] conventional way of doing things are not
[54:08] a deterrent but rather an opportunity of
[54:12] God to raise up in a greater way the
[54:16] seeds of this were sown even last year
[54:18] brother ron was ministering at our
[54:21] meetings when a sister thousands of
[54:24] miles away was moved upon in a
[54:27] supernatural way while listening to the
[54:30] service god delivered her and set her
[54:33] free in a miraculous way well I believe
[54:37] that that same God is here even today he
[54:41] is eternal he is omniscient and he is
[54:45] not bound by time borders and distance
[54:48] all things are possible if we can only
[54:52] open our hearts to believe so this
[54:54] weekend as brother Andrew and brother
[54:56] Ron Minister we believe God has already
[54:59] gone before us he is with us even now he
[55:04] will be with us even in a greater way in
[55:07] the days to follow what is great about
[55:10] this is that instead of sending just
[55:12] brother Ron or brother Andrew you all
[55:15] get to come and be a part of this as
[55:16] well so we want to say we're all coming
[55:20] together you're coming to us we're
[55:22] coming to you in the spirit of Christ we
[55:26] are joining together in a way that God
[55:28] will soon make manifest in a great way
[55:30] in the rapture that we are looking
[55:33] forward to God's Spirit will sweep over
[55:36] the world not bound by borders not bound
[55:39] by culture not bound by people sometimes
[55:42] but rather will bring us into an eternal
[55:46] realm I believe that even now that
[55:49] eternal one is with us and so I would
[55:53] ask you as your pastor and he is
[55:56] associate minister this weekend
[55:58] I will ask that you play your part pull
[56:02] on the word create an atmosphere let the
[56:05] word of God be inscribed into the time
[56:09] and the sands that have we been walking
[56:12] on for others to follow him as it was in
[56:16] the times of
[56:17] Nehemiah they were building a wall and
[56:19] it was a great role in the process of
[56:23] the restoration but they were bound by
[56:25] gaps in the wall where there was
[56:28] distance between the peoples it seemed
[56:31] that whenever the enemy would look at
[56:34] someone in isolation they would seize on
[56:37] that opportunity but Nehemiah brought
[56:39] the people together in a great way so
[56:42] that they were in one heart and one mind
[56:45] while the workers built there were those
[56:48] with swords and spears and when the
[56:50] enemy would attack one side they would
[56:53] gather together and help one another
[56:55] today we are not separated by gaps but
[57:05] we are not separated by gaps and the
[57:09] clip cut off right there but he said to
[57:11] tell you like Nehemiah stomm in time
[57:15] message Tabernacle is there to fill the
[57:17] gap for a full gospel light house
[57:19] Tabernacle we are pulling for one
[57:22] another we are brothers and sisters
[57:24] standing shoulder to shoulder let's lay
[57:27] the enemy together God richly bless you
[57:30] so god bless you brother had and the
[57:33] believers at endtime message Tabernacle
[57:41] it is it is an absolute honor to be a
[57:44] part of these these meetings to be a
[57:47] part of this time it's it's a different
[57:49] time for all of us we're all gathered
[57:51] together but we'd like to thank brother
[57:53] ed and brother Harold for the
[57:55] opportunity to be able to speak at their
[57:57] convention and I know that the setting
[57:59] is different and the circumstances have
[58:02] changed some things but I believe that
[58:04] God has ordained these things for this
[58:07] meeting to still be able to carry on and
[58:09] for Full Gospel lighthouse to be a part
[58:11] of those things
[58:12] we appreciate brother Harold and brother
[58:15] had their their burden to to see the God
[58:18] of omnipotence that we are seeing here
[58:21] and very present and acting in our midst
[58:24] that in these meetings that God will do
[58:27] supernatural things and the miracles
[58:29] that we're hearing week to week we will
[58:31] hear more from these meetings than ever
[58:33] before we know that we're serving a God
[58:36] of omnipotence and omnipresence and
[58:38] there's no distance no time to our God
[58:40] and though we may be thousands of miles
[58:43] away the angel of the Lord is ever
[58:45] present for he said I'll never leave you
[58:48] nor forsake you and while we speak this
[58:51] this weekend the word of life here at
[58:55] Full Gospel lighthouse and that evening
[58:57] at the end time message Tabernacle I
[59:00] admonish you to let the Holy Ghost
[59:02] overshadow you and brood over your life
[59:05] and minister to you and reach out you
[59:08] reach out in your faith and touch the
[59:09] Living God because our God is big enough
[59:12] our God is strong enough and what the
[59:16] enemy has is not enough to stop us so
[59:19] let's move forward in these meetings and
[59:21] let us have a grand time in the presence
[59:24] of the Lord maybe as we stand before we
[59:27] go to the reading of the word maybe we
[59:28] could sing that song only believe all
[59:30] things are possible
[59:34] you have your Bibles will turn over in
[59:36] the Book of Daniel chapter 6 in merciful
[59:41] we believe all things are possible he
[1:00:00] won't
[1:00:05] Oh
[1:00:08] oh that all things are possible only me
[1:00:34] now for for you that that don't know
[1:00:38] where we're grabbing from thank you
[1:00:40] musicians but I'd like to I'd like to
[1:00:43] carry on a thought that that I have been
[1:00:46] looking at and it's more than a thought
[1:00:48] but I believe that it came from the mind
[1:00:51] of God we are very acquainted with the
[1:00:56] general brother Roy Shrewsbury that is
[1:01:00] embed West Virginia pastors a very nice
[1:01:04] church there and believers of this
[1:01:05] endtime message and brother Roy had
[1:01:09] called brother on several times just to
[1:01:11] bring you up to speed to where we are so
[1:01:14] that everyone is up on the same basis
[1:01:16] and he called brother on at the very
[1:01:18] beginning of this journey that he was
[1:01:20] facing with cancer brother Roy called
[1:01:23] with Iran twice and he told him no
[1:01:28] brother on your you're going into a cave
[1:01:30] that no one else has ever came out of
[1:01:32] but I say by the Spirit of the Lord you
[1:01:35] will say like Daniel before the lines
[1:01:37] then Oh King I'll see you in the morning
[1:01:43] and tonight I'd like to focus our fault
[1:01:45] on on the force of God that is moving a
[1:01:49] people into the miraculous I realize
[1:01:53] that there are men of God and mighty men
[1:01:58] of God that would never dare say
[1:01:59] anything unless God speaks it so we
[1:02:03] realize that there has to be a move of
[1:02:05] the Spirit of God that would force a man
[1:02:07] to speak those things so tonight by the
[1:02:10] help of the Lord I'd like to speak to
[1:02:12] you on moved by the spirit
[1:02:15] Daniel chapter 6 and verse 4 the Bible
[1:02:20] says here then the presidents and
[1:02:22] princes sought to find occasion against
[1:02:24] Daniel concerning the kingdom but they
[1:02:28] could find none the occasion nor fault
[1:02:30] for as much as he was faithful neither
[1:02:33] was there any error or fault found in
[1:02:35] him then said these these men we shall
[1:02:39] not find any occasion against this
[1:02:40] Daniel except we find it against him
[1:02:43] concerning the law of his God then these
[1:02:47] presidents and princes assembled
[1:02:49] together to the king and said that thus
[1:02:52] unto him King Darius live forever all
[1:02:57] the presidents of the kingdom the
[1:02:59] governors and the princes the counselors
[1:03:02] and the captains have consulted together
[1:03:04] to establish a royal statute and to make
[1:03:08] a firm decree that whosoever shall ask a
[1:03:11] petition of any God or man for 30 days
[1:03:14] save of the O king he shall be cast into
[1:03:17] the den of lions so we noticed the trap
[1:03:20] that the enemy is wanting to set for the
[1:03:22] believers now O King established the
[1:03:25] decree and sound the writing that it be
[1:03:28] not changed according to the law of the
[1:03:30] Medes and Persians which alter earth not
[1:03:32] wherefore wherefore King Darius signed
[1:03:37] the writing and the decree now when now
[1:03:41] when Daniel knew that the writing was
[1:03:43] signed he went into his house and his
[1:03:45] windows being open in his chamber to
[1:03:47] ward Jerusalem he kneeled up
[1:03:50] his knees three times a day and prayed
[1:03:53] and gave thanks before his God as he did
[1:03:57] a four time so the circumstance that he
[1:04:00] was in did not change his behavior nor
[1:04:03] his character but his character was
[1:04:06] already in place before the trap was set
[1:04:09] amen let's bow our hearts before the
[1:04:11] Lord
[1:04:12] this afternoon dear Heavenly Father we
[1:04:15] have gathered in a very special way this
[1:04:18] evening
[1:04:18] a father the Bible tells us that we
[1:04:21] assemble ourselves and we not forsake it
[1:04:23] father and Lord Jesus there are meetings
[1:04:26] that have been on put on hold that had
[1:04:29] been cancelled conventions cancelled and
[1:04:31] meeting set and postponed but father you
[1:04:34] have placed it on the heart of men to be
[1:04:36] able to bring and present a meeting in
[1:04:38] such a way that we realized that we are
[1:04:41] not sitting here alone in in our own
[1:04:43] congregations but we're sitting here as
[1:04:45] a mini member body of Christ and as
[1:04:48] we've gathered here this this evening
[1:04:51] Lord to bring forth the preaching of the
[1:04:53] word we realize that we're absolutely
[1:04:55] nothing without you that we cannot do
[1:04:58] anything unless you have your complete
[1:05:00] control in this service we know that we
[1:05:03] are incapable of bringing forth the word
[1:05:05] now man can flip back the pages of the
[1:05:07] Bible but man cannot reveal it it takes
[1:05:10] the Holy Spirit to reveal it but when
[1:05:12] the Holy Spirit begins to reveal the
[1:05:14] word of the hour then there is nothing
[1:05:17] that the enemy can do to stop that
[1:05:19] revelation from bringing and coming
[1:05:21] forth and manifesting sons and daughters
[1:05:24] of God like never before I pray that you
[1:05:26] would go across the audience they're an
[1:05:29] endtime message Tabernacle and here at
[1:05:31] Full Gospel lighthouse and I pretty
[1:05:33] tonight that you would discern the very
[1:05:34] thoughts and the intents of the heart I
[1:05:36] pray the angel the Lord would stand ever
[1:05:39] so near to minister and to call out
[1:05:41] needs and minister life and peace and
[1:05:43] health and may we see the direction of
[1:05:46] the Holy Ghost and may we just step into
[1:05:48] that channel of faith and reach out and
[1:05:51] touch you as you're passing by Lord I
[1:05:53] pray that you'd move us as a people
[1:05:55] sometimes we get so bound
[1:05:58] our traditions it gets so bound in who
[1:06:00] we are and found that this is the way
[1:06:02] things are but I pray that you would
[1:06:04] move us by your spirit I pray that you
[1:06:06] would move us by the power of the word
[1:06:08] that you would make us and realize that
[1:06:10] there's more force and there is against
[1:06:13] us I pray that the angel of God that is
[1:06:16] ever near right now would stand and
[1:06:19] preach and declare the word of truth to
[1:06:21] your children Lord we ask all of these
[1:06:23] things in the name of our Lord Jesus
[1:06:25] Christ amen
[1:06:27] god bless you you may be seated in the
[1:06:29] presence of the Lord also if you have
[1:06:32] your Bibles we turn over to second Peter
[1:06:35] chapter 1 and verse 19 we have also a
[1:06:45] more sure word of prophecy whereunto you
[1:06:49] do well you do well that you take heed
[1:06:52] as unto a light that sounded in a dark
[1:06:55] place until the day dawn and the day
[1:06:58] star arise in your hearts knowing this
[1:07:01] first that that no prophecy let's say
[1:07:04] that together that no prophecy of the
[1:07:07] scripture is of any private
[1:07:09] interpretation for the prophecy came not
[1:07:13] in old time by the will of man but holy
[1:07:16] men of God spake as they were moved they
[1:07:21] were moved they were moved by the Holy
[1:07:25] Ghost
[1:07:25] now this message that we have received
[1:07:28] in this hour we realized that those
[1:07:31] things that we have received have came
[1:07:33] from the very mind of Christ and we
[1:07:36] realized that it was more than a
[1:07:38] kentucky hillbilly that was speaking to
[1:07:40] us but we were watching a move of the
[1:07:43] Holy Ghost that was that was working
[1:07:45] with working through a man that had a
[1:07:47] seventh grade education and there's no
[1:07:49] man in his own mind or as their own
[1:07:51] intellect that he could be able to bring
[1:07:53] forth those things except the Holy Ghost
[1:07:56] so put those things there and we realize
[1:07:58] that the things that we have received is
[1:08:00] none other than thus saith the Lord
[1:08:03] we look out upon this hour and we see
[1:08:06] that we look in laodicea and we see that
[1:08:09] there is an intellectual pregnant that
[1:08:12] has taken place in people's minds but
[1:08:14] but we look out and we look back upon
[1:08:16] the Bible and we read the Bible Peter
[1:08:19] James and John and could you imagine
[1:08:21] them sitting down at a psychiatrist and
[1:08:23] trying to trying to sit down and let
[1:08:26] them bring in their reasoning powers and
[1:08:28] bring in their intellectual conceptions
[1:08:30] and bring in those things I believe that
[1:08:32] believers today are the same just as
[1:08:35] believers were then that we are birthed
[1:08:37] under the word of the hour those men
[1:08:41] were not under an intellectual
[1:08:43] conception but they were moved by the
[1:08:45] Holy Ghost just like when they were
[1:08:47] moved to go to the temple to praise they
[1:08:50] went by the gate of beautiful and they
[1:08:52] called a man that had been crippled for
[1:08:54] all of those years and he had not they
[1:08:56] said we have not what you ask of us but
[1:08:58] such as we have we give you in the name
[1:09:01] of the Lord Jesus Christ and rise up and
[1:09:03] walk now we realize that though man can
[1:09:06] do that but deity in man would move man
[1:09:09] to be able to speak those things and say
[1:09:11] those things and we look out upon this
[1:09:13] age of Laodicea and we see the things
[1:09:15] that are transpiring and we would ask
[1:09:17] him for the RAM would ask the question
[1:09:19] in God of this evil age has God lost
[1:09:21] control
[1:09:22] or is he allowing another agency or is
[1:09:25] he permitting another agency to control
[1:09:27] he said the answer to this is that there
[1:09:30] is two spirits in a framework that is
[1:09:34] opposing one another and one of them is
[1:09:36] the devil in his deception and the other
[1:09:38] is the great holy spirit of God and they
[1:09:41] are opposing one another and I know
[1:09:43] which side I'm standing on and I know
[1:09:45] it's realm I want to be moved by and I
[1:09:48] know which realm I am influenced by but
[1:09:51] we watch as men today are influenced by
[1:09:53] that realm and influenced by the realm
[1:09:55] of darkness but we are not like those of
[1:09:58] darkness we have
[1:09:59] had a man that have stood here and has
[1:10:01] turned on the light in this hour when
[1:10:04] darkness was surrounding us the children
[1:10:07] of God had light down in Goshen and
[1:10:09] we're standing in an hour where God has
[1:10:12] not lost control of his people God has
[1:10:14] complete control and supreme authority
[1:10:17] and has the preeminence in his people
[1:10:19] and God has got control of the believers
[1:10:22] in this hour just like he had control
[1:10:24] over Daniel just like he had control
[1:10:27] over David just like he had control over
[1:10:29] the believers throughout the Bible and
[1:10:31] we are watching none other than Jesus
[1:10:33] Christ in body form again percent the
[1:10:36] same life the same word the same actions
[1:10:39] the same power the same scientist same
[1:10:42] wonders we are watching a people that is
[1:10:45] moved by none other than Jesus Christ to
[1:10:48] me it's an absolute paradox that where
[1:10:50] we live in an age that's so dark but yet
[1:10:52] it's a people that choose to defy the
[1:10:55] armies of the enemy but they begin to
[1:10:59] lift up the praises of the Almighty God
[1:11:02] and they will not allow the enemy to
[1:11:03] come in and steal and kill and destroy
[1:11:05] their life it's a paradox to watch of
[1:11:08] people as their fellowshiping with the
[1:11:10] Lord Jesus Christ by the hearing of the
[1:11:13] word and when you watch the people that
[1:11:15] are overcoming the darkness of Laodicea
[1:11:18] right here in Satan's Eden in the midst
[1:11:20] of chaos and in the midst of perversion
[1:11:22] and utter chaos and people that's living
[1:11:25] true to God a people that is that is
[1:11:28] dressed by the lord of the hour by the
[1:11:31] spoken word that's been released in this
[1:11:33] hour to see these things as an absolute
[1:11:36] paradox when men can't live true to
[1:11:39] their lives and men and men want to live
[1:11:41] with men and women want to live with
[1:11:43] women when you see a paradox of a man
[1:11:45] and a woman live true to themselves live
[1:11:48] true to one another but then to watch
[1:11:50] the paradox between the bride and the
[1:11:52] bridegroom what we are seeing is when
[1:11:55] God says I
[1:11:57] and my children there will not be one
[1:12:07] scar on you when you get on that other
[1:12:10] side but you will be standing there
[1:12:12] victorious as a people that made it over
[1:12:15] [Applause]
[1:12:17] hallelujah
[1:12:20] well you look out upon the land and you
[1:12:22] see every demon out of a pit of hell and
[1:12:24] we're talking about a cave we're talking
[1:12:27] about a cave but when you see every
[1:12:29] demon of hell coming out of that pit of
[1:12:31] hell and it's attacking the ministry
[1:12:33] it's attacking the the ladies of the of
[1:12:36] Christ it's attacking the laity and it's
[1:12:38] attacking the move of God when you watch
[1:12:40] when you see the Spirit of God begin to
[1:12:42] move and then there's people today that
[1:12:44] want to shut down that move it shows
[1:12:46] that there there is a moving in another
[1:12:49] realm of Darkness who wants to shut down
[1:12:51] the move of God but when I see it on a
[1:12:54] portal and when men and women are being
[1:12:56] attacked in what they truly believe in
[1:12:58] is none other than that safe the Lord it
[1:13:01] proves to me and further vindicates that
[1:13:04] this message is none other than Jesus
[1:13:06] Christ is same yesterday today and
[1:13:09] forever
[1:13:16] but there's the people on earth today
[1:13:18] that's living it out they're living out
[1:13:20] what this message said it's not just
[1:13:22] books and tapes it's not just pictures
[1:13:25] on the wall but they're living out what
[1:13:26] the Bible said they're living out what
[1:13:28] the message said they are what we are
[1:13:30] seeing is the manifestation of
[1:13:32] Revelations tn8 revelations 19 6 and
[1:13:36] revelations when we're watching and
[1:13:38] seeing those things as the people eat
[1:13:40] that book become that book and speak
[1:13:42] that book what is it it's a living out
[1:13:45] just like he was in Daniels day
[1:13:47] Daniel was living in an hour when he
[1:13:49] purposed in himself that he would not
[1:13:52] defile himself with the Kings meat and
[1:13:54] the King Street and the Bible tells us
[1:13:56] that Daniel was excellent in spirit now
[1:14:00] that was a ward in which none other
[1:14:03] knows there was nobody else down in
[1:14:05] Babylon that this was said of that they
[1:14:07] were excellent in spirit except for the
[1:14:10] believer Daniel now the Bible tells us
[1:14:12] that Daniel was a dissolver of bats and
[1:14:15] you find that when the Queen when the
[1:14:17] Queen of Belshazzar which you realized
[1:14:19] when there was a dream of the king that
[1:14:21] could not be interpreted by the Wiseman
[1:14:23] and the madhouse of that day she said
[1:14:25] there is a man in the land that is a
[1:14:28] resolver of the doubts what was she
[1:14:30] saying is that he had the answer to
[1:14:33] every problem or every question and we
[1:14:36] again have the Holy Spirit in this hour
[1:14:38] that is the desorber of doubts that has
[1:14:41] the answer to the devil's question that
[1:14:47] he dissolves all the questions that you
[1:14:49] could present before this great dog and
[1:14:52] what was Daniel doing he was silencing
[1:14:54] the chaos of the hour that's what this
[1:14:57] Lord is doing he is silencing the chaos
[1:15:01] of Laodicea by a people of the open book
[1:15:06] we look at history and we look back at
[1:15:09] Daniel and we look and see with the
[1:15:12] Prophet told us and then Gables
[1:15:15] instructions to Daniel and we see that
[1:15:17] Daniel was 68 years old at this time and
[1:15:21] look at the background of Daniel he was
[1:15:23] he was an alien yet he was a stood from
[1:15:25] his people al stood from his church
[1:15:27] without one church service without any
[1:15:29] Church to go to without any hymns to be
[1:15:31] saying but he's saying his self in the
[1:15:34] midst of all of this he still held on to
[1:15:37] what that prophet said he had no church
[1:15:39] to go to nobody to fellowship with
[1:15:41] everybody went to the heathen temples
[1:15:43] everybody worship their idols no
[1:15:46] Christian songs nobody nobody believed
[1:15:48] the same thing he did and in 68 years
[1:15:51] from a young man about 12 to 14 years
[1:15:55] old when he was taken down there he
[1:15:58] still held on to what the Prophet said
[1:16:02] now to think about the hour that Daniel
[1:16:05] was living in when there's nobody else
[1:16:07] around here now you're sitting here
[1:16:08] tonight when where there's more that are
[1:16:10] sitting here than what you even realize
[1:16:12] but you're living in an hour when you
[1:16:14] got peers around you you got believers
[1:16:16] around you but Daniel was in an hour
[1:16:18] when he had to stand alone when he was
[1:16:20] 68 years old he wasn't a young man at
[1:16:22] this time when you're reading of him but
[1:16:24] he had lived true all the way from a
[1:16:27] young person all the way up to an
[1:16:29] elderly man but he was holding on to
[1:16:31] that promise when it looked like there
[1:16:34] was no hope but Daniel still held on now
[1:16:38] notice what the Prophet said here in the
[1:16:40] great sounding like he said and these
[1:16:43] people certainly got acquainted with the
[1:16:45] gospel in the years of Israel's
[1:16:46] captivity of 70 years in the land of the
[1:16:49] Chaldeans and surely Daniel being made
[1:16:52] the chief of the Magi the prophet by his
[1:16:55] great wisdom to know the end of flings
[1:16:58] and to know what God was going to do and
[1:17:00] he was called the chief of the magic and
[1:17:04] the Magi no notice and the magic eyes
[1:17:06] had their old manuscripts that they
[1:17:08] referred to of their ancient fathers and
[1:17:11] Daniel noticed what Daniel brings in
[1:17:14] he didn't bring in websites he didn't
[1:17:17] bring in blogs he didn't bring it what
[1:17:19] everybody else was saying but Daniel
[1:17:21] brings in the writings of the Lord and
[1:17:23] so we understand that during this time
[1:17:25] that they had counseled much together
[1:17:28] now you talking about a meeting they had
[1:17:32] kept so much together and they had seen
[1:17:34] the wisdom and the power that the one
[1:17:37] true God produced that was far beyond
[1:17:40] any astronomer or imagina it was proved
[1:17:43] at the night of King Belshazzar stance
[1:17:47] so that that none of the Chaldeans where
[1:17:49] the astronomers could read the
[1:17:50] handwriting on the wall but Daniel
[1:17:53] through the spirit and the power of the
[1:17:55] Living God could do it and his writings
[1:17:57] were kept sacred and are till this thing
[1:18:00] so we look and we see when we've got
[1:18:03] we've got in a time when Daniel was
[1:18:06] standing alone but yet he is the man in
[1:18:09] which God is producing his mind he is
[1:18:12] producing his power and Daniel was
[1:18:14] staying true now notice what brother
[1:18:16] Branham said he said sixty-eight years
[1:18:18] he'd been down there and Babylon amongst
[1:18:21] the heathens and he still had the
[1:18:23] victory he'd been down there all those
[1:18:26] years and he still had the victory and
[1:18:29] brother Branham but said that that but
[1:18:31] we can't stay an hour to think about a
[1:18:35] man that was standing all by himself
[1:18:38] nobody else around and they said that
[1:18:40] the three Hebrew children were in
[1:18:42] another part of the kingdom
[1:18:43] Daniel didn't know where they were but
[1:18:45] he was standing all by himself
[1:18:47] and he held on to the victory what about
[1:18:50] the children of God that's filled with
[1:18:52] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:18:53] how much smoke should they hold on to
[1:18:55] the victory when nobody else is around
[1:18:59] you want to steal Bo to hold on to the
[1:19:02] victory when the Pats train able to lay
[1:19:04] his hands on to you
[1:19:05] you steal ought to be able to hold on to
[1:19:07] the victory when you ain't seen a dream
[1:19:10] and he ain't hit a vision but you still
[1:19:12] hold it on when you ain't heard the
[1:19:14] voice in a long time when the agency
[1:19:16] names win a long time but you still hold
[1:19:18] it on it shows that the serpent on the
[1:19:22] inside that's it's moving you into the
[1:19:27] realm but the supernatural but Daniels
[1:19:34] standing alone with God held the victory
[1:19:36] for 68 years they cover 68 years he had
[1:19:41] kept the victory and was undefiled
[1:19:43] before God without the baptism of the
[1:19:45] Holy Ghost without the blood of Jesus
[1:19:48] Christ to make intercession for him with
[1:19:50] only the blood of bulls and goats and
[1:19:52] efforts which he had to offer secretly
[1:19:55] because of the human traditions of that
[1:19:57] land they had been taken down there and
[1:20:04] Jeremiah prophesied to them that they
[1:20:06] were going down there you remember when
[1:20:09] that false prophet I believe it's not a
[1:20:11] meal is how it's pronounced that he had
[1:20:13] proclaimed that that this was not true
[1:20:15] but yet God showed that Jeremiah's
[1:20:18] prophecy was absolutely correct is that
[1:20:22] right
[1:20:22] there's been a lot of people that's rose
[1:20:24] up in this how that God still proved who
[1:20:27] was right
[1:20:29] they've been taken down there and
[1:20:31] Jeremiah prophesied a film that they
[1:20:34] were going down there but notice now
[1:20:36] Daniel oh my he begin to see that the
[1:20:39] time was getting close just as we are
[1:20:41] today and Daniel begin to understand the
[1:20:45] Bible said that Daniel began to
[1:20:47] understand by the reading of the books
[1:20:51] he began to understand by the reading of
[1:20:54] the books of Jeremiah that the time was
[1:20:57] at hand that captivity was almost over
[1:21:01] so here a prophet was taken another
[1:21:04] prophets word and pointing it at the
[1:21:06] hour that he's living in and saying were
[1:21:09] almost out of here captivity is almost
[1:21:13] over here he is in his 16 yet 68 year
[1:21:16] old body but in knurl Isis I got two
[1:21:19] more years and I'm out of here I don't
[1:21:22] care if it's ten more years two more
[1:21:25] years ten more minutes or ten more
[1:21:27] seconds I'm out of here
[1:21:31] activity it's almost over
[1:21:35] you see he understood that God was
[1:21:38] coming to place a claim on his position
[1:21:41] and his possession of the children of
[1:21:43] God and here Daniel was looking back to
[1:21:46] what the Bible said now he not didn't
[1:21:50] have a Bible to look back to and Abraham
[1:21:52] had didn't have a Bible to look back to
[1:21:54] but Daniel was standing at an hour like
[1:21:56] you and I are standing in when there's
[1:21:59] nobody else around him when he was
[1:22:01] standing by himself standing in a moment
[1:22:03] where I gotta believe yes but he's
[1:22:10] standing in an hour and he's reading out
[1:22:13] of a book what it says about him what
[1:22:16] about you and I how much more can we
[1:22:19] understand by the book after the seven
[1:22:22] seals have been released lots of the
[1:22:24] back of the book and the land
[1:22:25] Spain and place redemption claims on his
[1:22:28] inheritance also and that you are his
[1:22:32] your names in that book the lamb stood
[1:22:35] up for you in this hour
[1:22:38] hallelujah did stand up for the church
[1:22:40] wall he stood up for his bride
[1:22:45] hallelujah we understand by this book we
[1:22:49] understand that the things of the Lord
[1:22:51] are pertaining to us in this hour that
[1:22:54] we're going to make it look at your
[1:22:56] neighbors say we're gonna make it we're
[1:22:58] going to overcome the rapture is at hand
[1:23:03] when you got people that are looking out
[1:23:05] upon the nation today and don't know
[1:23:07] whether there's a wraps or not people
[1:23:12] don't know if there's our catching away
[1:23:13] or not they don't know what is right
[1:23:15] they don't know what is wrong but there
[1:23:17] is a people that understand by the book
[1:23:20] that you're the people of the seventh
[1:23:22] seal that will be released on rapture
[1:23:24] morning that you will be changed in a
[1:23:28] moment that at week four we can stay
[1:23:32] we understand by the readings profitable
[1:23:36] but nobody else wants to live right
[1:23:39] that's the government people don't wants
[1:23:41] to live life when there's nobody that
[1:23:43] won't slow overcome your overcoming when
[1:23:45] everybody just wants the past boom
[1:23:47] you're more than just passing through
[1:23:49] you're making your mark on history
[1:23:56] that's a people that's moved by the
[1:24:00] spirit it's an amazing thing to
[1:24:07] understand what your position is in the
[1:24:09] book it's an absolute amazing thing when
[1:24:12] you go to reading about understanding
[1:24:14] and only that understanding can come
[1:24:16] from the throne of God it's an amazing
[1:24:18] thing when you go to teaching somebody
[1:24:20] about water baptism and absurd seed and
[1:24:22] they're sitting there like where in the
[1:24:24] world did you come from but you begin to
[1:24:26] speak to somebody else and you begin to
[1:24:28] tell them the same exact things that you
[1:24:31] told them and she told the first person
[1:24:33] before and it's all of a sudden boom the
[1:24:36] light is shone upon them and they begin
[1:24:38] to understand not by your knowledge but
[1:24:41] by the books there's a lot of people
[1:24:46] they don't understand what I'm talking
[1:24:48] about tonight but there's a people of
[1:24:50] God that have gathered around the
[1:24:52] revealed word of the hour that
[1:24:53] understand that they will be the last
[1:24:56] runners of this age there is make in
[1:24:59] another people in this hour that will be
[1:25:02] the final boys
[1:25:03] [Applause]
[1:25:05] she will not be hindered she will not be
[1:25:07] packed out but she will overcome she
[1:25:10] will run her race and she will say what
[1:25:13] the tape says you remember when the Lord
[1:25:19] asked Joe and Joe chapter 34 he said
[1:25:23] where was she remember he said where was
[1:25:27] she when I laid the foundation of the
[1:25:29] Lord declare if thou hast understand me
[1:25:33] so job was standing at a spot that he
[1:25:35] didn't understand
[1:25:36] so here the Lord is asking him declare
[1:25:39] it if you know and John couldn't answer
[1:25:41] him John couldn't answer in that spot
[1:25:43] but when the Lord begin to reveal the
[1:25:46] things then Joe could answer there was a
[1:25:52] lot of you that set out in the
[1:25:53] denominational world that you couldn't
[1:25:56] answer these things but when you come
[1:25:57] under the lord of the hour you begin to
[1:26:00] understand by the book and you begin to
[1:26:02] be able to answer what the book said are
[1:26:05] you with me he didn't have the
[1:26:07] understanding he was lacking the
[1:26:09] understanding you remember what the
[1:26:11] prophets said about Moses that that
[1:26:13] burning bush had what Moses left I say
[1:26:18] to you Church of the Living God that
[1:26:20] this message has what you lack if you
[1:26:23] lacked understanding it's here if you
[1:26:26] lack revelation it's here if you're like
[1:26:28] healing it's here if you lack miracles
[1:26:31] it's here if you like understanding and
[1:26:33] a born-again experience it's here
[1:26:37] that same God is an advocate to reveal
[1:26:41] himself in a supernatural miraculous way
[1:26:44] that you think say that it was Andrew
[1:26:46] Spencer Ron Spencer had him a monster
[1:26:49] but it was the Holy Ghost that begin to
[1:26:51] reveal and do the works he's the same
[1:26:55] God where once you talk yeah when the
[1:27:02] morning stars sang together and all the
[1:27:04] sons of God shouted for joy what was he
[1:27:11] doing
[1:27:11] God was relating to job what his mind
[1:27:15] was he was telling jokes
[1:27:18] he was relaying to to that job I know
[1:27:20] you've been through some stuff I know
[1:27:24] you've been through some trials I know
[1:27:26] you've been through some troubles but
[1:27:28] job I didn't send you down in the AIDS
[1:27:31] that you're living here just to live
[1:27:33] down there defeated job I know you've
[1:27:36] been through some stuff but I want you
[1:27:38] to know I didn't send you down there so
[1:27:41] that you can scratch your boils and sat
[1:27:43] on your ass heap but I saw you shouting
[1:27:45] out to victory I didn't see you down
[1:27:48] there to feed it I didn't see you living
[1:27:50] in a depressed mind and having a life
[1:27:52] with anxiety and tormal and all kinds of
[1:27:55] depression and misery and all those
[1:27:57] saints I didn't send you down there
[1:27:59] I sent you down there to live out the
[1:28:01] victory notice what happened Joe was
[1:28:07] restored double-fold what has happened
[1:28:10] to the body of Jesus Christ you have a
[1:28:12] double portion of his spirits to speak
[1:28:16] things that the angel of the Lord said
[1:28:18] this ain't just for William Marion
[1:28:21] Branham this is for the plot its entire
[1:28:25] better people of God that's been called
[1:28:27] by God get moved by spirit not moved by
[1:28:31] the devil but moved by the Holy Ghost
[1:28:33] and move into a realm of the revelation
[1:28:36] of God that note that one hand could
[1:28:38] steal from you Christ came to destroy
[1:28:56] the works of the devil is that right I
[1:29:06] love it when the Bible tells us that we
[1:29:10] are not servants but we're sons and I
[1:29:14] believe it's too many times we sit
[1:29:16] around it and people get a servant
[1:29:18] attitude or a servant mentality instead
[1:29:20] of a son mentality you follow me you
[1:29:25] just never so many times we always want
[1:29:28] to stay out in the field when it's our
[1:29:29] time to be and in the banquet room so
[1:29:34] many times we want to stay out and do
[1:29:35] the work when it's our time to put the
[1:29:37] dress whole ritual be just too many
[1:29:42] times we get the mentality that we can't
[1:29:45] have it but when you are a son you can
[1:29:48] have everything that the father hatch
[1:29:51] [Applause]
[1:29:52] when you come to that spot of attraction
[1:29:55] it's not waiting no longer you're
[1:29:57] standing there in the same authority
[1:29:59] that the father has he can send you out
[1:30:02] into the field to do his work in his
[1:30:05] name because you are an adopted son of
[1:30:08] God you didn't belong to the devil you
[1:30:13] belong to God Daniel didn't belong to
[1:30:16] the Lions Danny belong to God David
[1:30:18] didn't belong to the glass he belonged
[1:30:21] to God Paul did not belong to the
[1:30:23] shipwreck he belong to God Ron Spitzer
[1:30:26] didn't
[1:30:29] [Applause]
[1:30:35] [Music]
[1:30:36] [Applause]
[1:30:40] Honolulu is because an understanding
[1:30:49] I know
[1:30:52] hallelujah now the Bible says in first
[1:30:58] John 5:19 that we know hallelujah that
[1:31:02] we are of God and the whole world laughs
[1:31:06] that wickedness but notice verse 20 and
[1:31:08] we know hallelujah there's power and
[1:31:14] knowledge there's power revelation and
[1:31:17] we know that the Son of God has come
[1:31:19] first and have given us an understanding
[1:31:22] that we may know him that is true and we
[1:31:25] are in him that is true even in His Son
[1:31:29] Jesus Christ this is the true God and
[1:31:32] eternal God and you allow the enemy to
[1:31:36] come in and tell you that you're gonna
[1:31:38] die how can you kill God when you are a
[1:31:41] part of Elohim he can no more kill you
[1:31:46] they kill Jesus he's here he's moving
[1:31:54] he's acting and we're seeing him but he
[1:31:58] is watching you in this hour to see how
[1:32:01] you react Sarah it's a reaction to an
[1:32:06] action and the angel the Lord is
[1:32:09] watching you tonight
[1:32:10] to see how you move towards this
[1:32:12] movement to see how you move towards
[1:32:15] this word to see how you move in faith
[1:32:17] and when you start moving in faith then
[1:32:20] all of a sudden the discerning of the
[1:32:23] Lord takes place and he starts reading
[1:32:25] your book he's watching you to see how
[1:32:31] you react to his action is that right if
[1:32:36] you would began to watch as a pillar
[1:32:38] Fawad slipping through this room and you
[1:32:40] would start to reject it he's watching
[1:32:43] how you act to that but if you would
[1:32:45] watch as that pillar if I was slipping
[1:32:47] in this room and hover over
[1:32:49] your life and in what you adore him and
[1:32:52] make love to him he's going to move on
[1:32:55] your behalf this is a movie of God and I
[1:33:02] don't want to miss it the things we are
[1:33:06] seeing for gospel lighthouse are things
[1:33:08] that only he can do there's no man that
[1:33:13] can make these things happen when we
[1:33:14] start hearing about miracles not just
[1:33:16] every month not just every week but we
[1:33:19] start hearing about them every day
[1:33:21] actually we're in a very special spot as
[1:33:24] the bride of Jesus Christ for the
[1:33:26] headship is connected to the body and we
[1:33:30] get ready for departure but we watch
[1:33:32] this move of God and there's all types
[1:33:34] of movements in the world today there's
[1:33:37] all types of movements that are that are
[1:33:38] worldly movements and I don't even know
[1:33:41] what half of the movements are out there
[1:33:42] I got to read about some of the
[1:33:43] movements out there and I thought my
[1:33:45] goodness
[1:33:47] that ain't a movement that's a devil
[1:33:51] you go to reading about the me2 movement
[1:33:53] and go to reading about the
[1:33:54] blacklivesmatter movement you get to
[1:33:56] digging into their beliefs and all of
[1:33:57] those movements and getting their
[1:33:59] reading in the defund the police
[1:34:01] movement and tearing down statues
[1:34:03] movement and tearing down history
[1:34:04] movement tearing out all kinds of things
[1:34:07] what are they trying to do it's a type
[1:34:09] of the spiritual and the natural and
[1:34:12] it's a type that Satan is trying to tear
[1:34:14] down your belief system and trying to
[1:34:16] stop the move of God what do they do it
[1:34:19] something is driving them to tear down
[1:34:22] these things something is moving them to
[1:34:25] go into that realm and do those types of
[1:34:27] things but whatever you do you can get
[1:34:30] connected socially involved all types of
[1:34:33] different things but don't you dare miss
[1:34:35] the moving of the Holy Spirit you can
[1:34:41] read on the news what The News says but
[1:34:43] do not miss the revelation of the hour
[1:34:45] that God is moving his people closer to
[1:34:51] him a notice is just few excerpts he
[1:34:54] says brother Brent said when God moves
[1:34:56] in the spirit his children move with it
[1:35:02] when you watch the pillar of fire
[1:35:05] throughout the Old Testament as it would
[1:35:07] move you would watch as the pillar fire
[1:35:09] moved then the camp moved and when
[1:35:12] people stopped moving with the pillar
[1:35:14] fire that's when they died that is where
[1:35:18] the Pentecostal organization died is
[1:35:21] when they stopped and organized and the
[1:35:24] Holy Ghost went on and they stood there
[1:35:26] in their denial and in the dead
[1:35:29] traditions but if God moves there's a
[1:35:32] purpose behind it God didn't just come
[1:35:35] down to this Saturday night service just
[1:35:37] for just an ordinary service he's got a
[1:35:40] purpose in mind and that's to draw you
[1:35:42] closer to him every time you watch as
[1:35:46] the Lord comes as he came down
[1:35:49] him he came with a purpose when he came
[1:35:51] to Enoch he came with a purpose he came
[1:35:54] to Enoch and he won't goofing off and
[1:35:55] God took him that was his purpose he
[1:35:58] came to Abraham and he changed his body
[1:36:01] he came to Moses and he brought
[1:36:03] deliverance he came to Daniel and he
[1:36:06] took him out the lines then he comes
[1:36:09] only with a purpose and if he shows up
[1:36:12] here tonight he's come here with a
[1:36:14] purpose he's got you in mind and you're
[1:36:18] his purpose and he did not come here
[1:36:20] just to make a show of himself he came
[1:36:22] here to move on your behalf and bring
[1:36:25] you closer to him now notice and when
[1:36:29] God moves in the supernatural your heart
[1:36:32] will hunger right to it that's a move of
[1:36:41] God now notice in expectation he says
[1:36:45] everywhere God moves at any time through
[1:36:47] the Bible you'll see healings miracles
[1:36:49] signs and wonders now many people don't
[1:36:54] want the moving of God no more and
[1:36:57] that's why they don't have healing
[1:36:58] that's why they don't have miracles and
[1:37:00] that's why they don't have signs and
[1:37:02] wonders why because they stopped the
[1:37:04] moving of God but everywhere God moves
[1:37:11] everywhere God moves it's not the
[1:37:15] preacher it's not the deacon and it's
[1:37:18] not it's not you but everywhere God
[1:37:21] moves it's not something that you say in
[1:37:23] your own power that I'm going to do this
[1:37:25] but everywhere God moves any type of the
[1:37:28] Bible you see healings you see miracles
[1:37:31] you see signs and wonders and he loves
[1:37:35] it he leaves a tract behind him of the
[1:37:38] supernatural
[1:37:40] he leaves a trail that you can follow
[1:37:43] how many of you Hillbillies down here
[1:37:45] you understand track of the blood you
[1:37:47] track of that blood like that bloodline
[1:37:49] and you follow that deer when it's been
[1:37:51] shot but here the Holy Ghost is leaving
[1:37:54] a trail for you to follow now maybe you
[1:37:56] don't know where he's at and maybe you
[1:37:58] ain't seen him but if you'll just watch
[1:37:59] the miracles and massage her wonders
[1:38:02] that are happening in the body of Jesus
[1:38:03] Christ
[1:38:04] it'll lead you right to the headship
[1:38:06] that's making these Saints possible we
[1:38:13] see when he begins to move the world
[1:38:15] shakes when he begins to move things
[1:38:17] change when he begins to move to watch
[1:38:20] his kingdoms begin to fall and crush you
[1:38:23] watch as the angel of the Lord would
[1:38:25] move on from tent to camp and as they
[1:38:27] would go you would watch the moving of
[1:38:30] the Lord as he would go out and he would
[1:38:32] prosper his children in battle and in
[1:38:35] war and when they were set down to feast
[1:38:37] he would bless them why because they
[1:38:40] moved with the spirit and when we see
[1:38:43] the moving of God it's a time to step in
[1:38:45] the waters and get right in I have to
[1:38:51] tell you I've been a part of a lot of
[1:38:52] special things in life I've been a part
[1:38:54] of various supernatural things seeing a
[1:38:56] pillar of fire seen the angel of the
[1:38:58] Lord but to me seeing the move of God in
[1:39:01] this generation is something that I have
[1:39:03] never seen in all of my life to watch it
[1:39:06] move on young people and young people
[1:39:08] call right right Road Road to see hearts
[1:39:12] being transformed and healings
[1:39:14] manifested relationships being restored
[1:39:17] and product was coming back home and the
[1:39:20] miraculous present every day it's a move
[1:39:23] of the Holy Ghost
[1:39:26] and we're very familiar as followers of
[1:39:29] the message of this Pope in the visible
[1:39:31] union of the Bride of Christ he says
[1:39:33] some of you people that really believe
[1:39:34] this to be the truth that we're entering
[1:39:37] into another age we're entering in the
[1:39:38] rapture age you know the church can't go
[1:39:41] in its condition and it can't get any
[1:39:43] better it must get worse
[1:39:45] how many knows that in the congregation
[1:39:47] it says hey man it's got to get worse it
[1:39:50] can't go like this
[1:39:52] it's got to be something and it's moving
[1:39:56] right now friend it's on the move is on
[1:39:59] for the bride that's thus that's the
[1:40:01] truth that's thus saith the Lord
[1:40:04] the move is on for the bride that's thus
[1:40:08] saith the Lord the brother Branham is
[1:40:11] not putting the bride over in another
[1:40:13] age or outside of the church ages no can
[1:40:16] I get a hearty amen
[1:40:17] he's not putting us outside of the
[1:40:19] church changes and he's not saying that
[1:40:21] this is a rapture aids that is set aside
[1:40:24] completely separate from the church ages
[1:40:26] but this is the age like you could say
[1:40:29] it's the television age it's the
[1:40:31] automobile age it's the rocket age but
[1:40:33] here brother Branham is telling us that
[1:40:35] this is the age of the rapture and there
[1:40:39] is a people in layers here that is
[1:40:41] rising above every form of ungodliness
[1:40:43] and unbelief the move is on that's thus
[1:40:50] saith the Lord you know where you were
[1:40:56] you know that you were dead in your
[1:40:58] trespasses and sin and all of a sudden
[1:41:01] he came by your way you didn't go to him
[1:41:03] he came by your way it was a moving of
[1:41:06] the angel of the Lord that came by your
[1:41:08] way and snatched you up because Eagles
[1:41:11] don't stay on the ground
[1:41:12] Eagles go into the heavens so so we see
[1:41:21] where this move is taking us it's not
[1:41:24] taking us outside of lay on us here it's
[1:41:27] taking us over coming way out of see
[1:41:29] that were more than enough to overcome
[1:41:32] Laodicea
[1:41:33] and it's taking us right into the mind
[1:41:36] of the Lord it's a move all right it's a
[1:41:43] move yeah when you look at the Wright
[1:41:48] brothers you see them how that they were
[1:41:52] the first in flight as many people have
[1:41:55] looked up in the sky they looked up in
[1:41:58] the sky they seen birds flying there but
[1:42:01] they didn't they weren't moved like
[1:42:03] these brothers removed you see because
[1:42:06] they'd seen something that was up in the
[1:42:09] heavens and they tell us they tell us
[1:42:13] that essa from a very little child that
[1:42:15] they were praying they were playing with
[1:42:17] a little bitty toy and that's that toy
[1:42:19] was spinning that thing broke and it
[1:42:22] began to fly off into the air and they
[1:42:24] begin that that dream began to build on
[1:42:26] the inside of him and as they were out
[1:42:28] there and they were watching the eagle
[1:42:30] and they would look up here at that echo
[1:42:33] and they would say you know what I
[1:42:34] believe that I can do that too I believe
[1:42:38] that I can get up there too so so this
[1:42:40] dream that they had was called was
[1:42:43] called crazy this dream that they had
[1:42:47] was called it was called stupid it was
[1:42:50] called idiotic
[1:42:51] it was called chaotic this dream that
[1:42:55] they had put them in a hospital this
[1:42:57] dream that they had would tear them
[1:43:00] apart would physically hurt them but
[1:43:02] they were driven by and moved to get
[1:43:06] into the heavens and they were looking
[1:43:09] they were watch that equal as that eagle
[1:43:12] would would go up in the sky they would
[1:43:14] watch it as it would begin to go out
[1:43:16] there and if we begin to soar but this
[1:43:18] wings out
[1:43:20] it could move higher than any other bird
[1:43:22] they would watch it as it would take its
[1:43:25] little eaglets it would take it off the
[1:43:28] cliff of the mountain and they would
[1:43:30] take that eaglet and a little baby eagle
[1:43:32] and they would drop that eco and they
[1:43:35] would drop and that eagle ain't got a
[1:43:37] clue how to fly and so that little
[1:43:39] inkling and it's the way an Apes are
[1:43:41] teaching her children how to fly she
[1:43:45] knows that if they stay there in the
[1:43:48] nest they'll die there but if she can
[1:43:51] ever teach them how to fly if she could
[1:43:54] ever teach them how to move and shake
[1:43:56] another teach them how to flap their
[1:43:59] wings and that little eagle goes out
[1:44:01] there over top of the canyons and that
[1:44:04] little Eagle begins to flop and flop and
[1:44:07] it begins to fall and fall and fall and
[1:44:09] it begins to flap he begins to flap and
[1:44:12] all of a sudden its wings are set and
[1:44:15] it's moving it's all around that mamma
[1:44:18] said that they could go in there is
[1:44:22] around that the body of Jesus Christ is
[1:44:25] breaking into because they move but the
[1:44:28] Holy Spirit that momma eagle told us
[1:44:31] that we could fly in
[1:44:34] hallelujah the domination said we
[1:44:36] couldn't file there Luther said we
[1:44:38] couldn't flower there Wesley said we
[1:44:40] couldn't fly there pinnacle said we
[1:44:42] couldn't fly there but I have heard a
[1:44:45] voice that said come up hither don't
[1:44:49] stay down there not get the nomination
[1:44:50] and in your dead creature no more rah
[1:44:54] rah rah up get out of that position you
[1:45:04] can sand your fingers and you can stand
[1:45:06] your
[1:45:07] [Applause]
[1:45:14] [Music]
[1:45:23] hey Thomas holy rose and make fun of us
[1:45:26] they tell us that we're never gonna
[1:45:28] become anything but one of these
[1:45:30] morning's we're going to become God
[1:45:40] it's a move it's a move of the Holy
[1:45:44] Ghost that wants to take you higher in
[1:45:46] your faith level mine angel is here he's
[1:45:56] with this message to take you all the
[1:46:01] way into the rapture and he ain't
[1:46:05] leaving this message so it means he
[1:46:09] can't leave you but he wants to
[1:46:13] challenging he wants to challenge you to
[1:46:17] let your faith loose now when he comes
[1:46:20] he comes with a purpose and it's coming
[1:46:22] too challenging to challenge you to
[1:46:24] believe and let your faith loose like
[1:46:27] never before now if you want to find out
[1:46:29] if he's still God you act upon it and
[1:46:32] lay yourself upon his altar and see what
[1:46:34] takes place you have to act on his word
[1:46:38] first Daniel before he saw the miracle
[1:46:41] of God could deliver him from the lion's
[1:46:43] den the first thing he did was act upon
[1:46:46] the Word of God
[1:46:47] the proclamation went forth if any man
[1:46:49] prays to any other God besides his Idol
[1:46:52] for so many days have you thrown into
[1:46:54] the Lions Den and no man could pray to
[1:46:56] any other God but to the king he had to
[1:46:59] be God for 30 days but what did Daniel
[1:47:02] do he acted upon the Word of God because
[1:47:07] when Solomon dedicated the temple he
[1:47:09] prayed he said Lord if not people be in
[1:47:12] trouble anywhere here and we'll look to
[1:47:14] this holy temple then you hear from
[1:47:16] heaven that's why Daniel acted first the
[1:47:20] threat was you're going into the Lions
[1:47:21] Den but Daniel acted on the Word of God
[1:47:23] and he knowed that God was still God
[1:47:27] just like Gideon did he knew that God if
[1:47:30] he was still God then where is his
[1:47:32] miracles and Daniel knew he was a
[1:47:34] prophet he knew he
[1:47:36] of God he knew he was a servant he knew
[1:47:39] that God was able to deliver him from
[1:47:41] the lines but if he was in trouble and
[1:47:43] under a threat he could turn his face
[1:47:46] towards the temple and pray three times
[1:47:49] a day just exactly he acted upon the
[1:47:53] Word of God and God filled him with him
[1:47:58] and God filled him so full of the Holy
[1:48:00] Ghost till the lines could meet him you
[1:48:06] are a people that is so filled with the
[1:48:08] baptism of the Holy Ghost that the line
[1:48:10] the line of hell cannot eat you cannot
[1:48:14] harm you because she was so filled with
[1:48:17] the power and the anointing like the
[1:48:19] mighty angel who are you talking about a
[1:48:24] power you're so filled with it that the
[1:48:26] devil don't know what to do with because
[1:48:35] 10 you acted on what God said you see he
[1:48:42] had a faith to reach into that realm
[1:48:46] brother Branham said that Daniel had to
[1:48:49] feel the hot breath off the line he had
[1:48:53] to feel he had to feel he had to feel
[1:48:57] that roar of the lion before the angel
[1:49:01] came but when he got in that moment by
[1:49:05] the random said that the angel of light
[1:49:07] swirled around Daniel and the Lions
[1:49:09] couldn't get to him
[1:49:10] I don't believe you forgive me you
[1:49:14] forgive me I don't believe that this was
[1:49:16] just for brother on but I believe that
[1:49:19] this is for the children of God that was
[1:49:22] like daniel said through the king o king
[1:49:25] i will see you in the morning the lines
[1:49:28] won't kill me
[1:49:29] death won't get to me but i see you in
[1:49:32] the morning and when i come out in the
[1:49:34] morning I'm gonna declare and the three
[1:49:36] that there is no God like to hope you
[1:49:43] watch me chat no white speak dance
[1:49:46] you'll watch me declare who got me out
[1:49:50] of that cave that was Jesus some of u
[1:49:55] s-- wanted to stay in that cave some of
[1:49:57] you like living with lines some of you
[1:49:59] like living with cheaters some of you
[1:50:01] like living with stealers some of you
[1:50:03] like living with liars and all kinds of
[1:50:06] all kinds of wickedness but I'm telling
[1:50:08] you you don't have to stay in that lines
[1:50:10] no more it's time to come out stop
[1:50:17] staying in that stupid condition and
[1:50:19] rise up battle lads out of your sin rise
[1:50:23] out of that cave you may not know how to
[1:50:26] get back out of it but there's an angel
[1:50:27] there that I'll be able to protect you
[1:50:29] sorry surely if he's there to protect
[1:50:32] you he'll get you out of the cage okay
[1:50:38] I'll see you in the morning well I don't
[1:50:50] know if I can I don't know if I can go
[1:50:53] anymore I don't know if I can dig dig
[1:50:56] these ditches no more Daniel knew how to
[1:51:00] pray
[1:51:03] Daniel Newhouse Daniel knew had a call
[1:51:06] on God he knew how to invoke the God of
[1:51:09] omnipotence and he realized that the God
[1:51:12] that was for him was able to bring him
[1:51:14] through all the way through captivity
[1:51:16] and he was realizing that this was a
[1:51:20] spot that I'm about to go free and the
[1:51:24] Bible tells us that the the Prince of
[1:51:27] Persia withstood Daniel in his prayer
[1:51:30] for three weeks for 21 days he withstood
[1:51:34] Daniel in his prayer and Daniel just
[1:51:37] kept on praying and when when the man
[1:51:40] that stood before him said now the
[1:51:43] Prince of Persia which stood me
[1:51:45] but Michael Cain Michael which is an
[1:51:48] angelic type of Christ he came and he
[1:51:51] showed up and when he showed up that
[1:51:54] devil of hail could not stop Daniel's
[1:51:57] prayer what was it then the man said to
[1:52:02] Daniel he said I am come for five words
[1:52:06] the words that Daniel had released from
[1:52:09] his mouth was the words that that angel
[1:52:12] had came forward there is a people that
[1:52:15] is speaking thus saith the Lord and he
[1:52:18] said I have come for thy words
[1:52:22] [Applause]
[1:52:30] but what if Daniel would've gave up all
[1:52:32] day 19
[1:52:34] what if Daniel would he gave up all day
[1:52:37] to Morty come on somebody
[1:52:40] let me bridge to you you living in
[1:52:42] Laodicea but you're not a part of
[1:52:44] Laodicea what if you were to give up a
[1:52:47] day before the rat sir you're that close
[1:52:54] but Daniel was not as those that turned
[1:52:58] around and turned back
[1:53:00] but Daniel dress the bath and Daniel
[1:53:03] prayed over he prayed on through 21 days
[1:53:06] when it felt like the clouds were hour
[1:53:09] and and nobody else was hearing him
[1:53:11] Daniel kept on praying how about you
[1:53:15] mamas how about you daddies how about
[1:53:19] you young people that said I'm not
[1:53:20] giving in and I'm not giving up it may
