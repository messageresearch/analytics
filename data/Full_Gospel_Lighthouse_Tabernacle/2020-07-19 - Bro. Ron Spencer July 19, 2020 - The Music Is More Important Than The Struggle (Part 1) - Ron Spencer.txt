beautiful woman and she had kind of thick lips looked like i saw her somewhere and she's she was trying to get to a doctor and she died and the spirit that was speaking to me said now they will say that she committed suicide but she died with a heart attack and said it's just a little before four but you can say it was four o'clock and the vision left me i told him what did that mean i didn't know somebody's fixing to die when we come out of the mountains two days later that the movie star what's that woman marilyn monroe she was kind of a strip teaser you read her story she was a illegitimate child her mother's in the insane institution poor little girl probably had a hard way and she always hungered for something i wish i could have got to her i know what she needed i knew

hallelujah hallelujah what a blessed day it is that we can live for him amen we just worship the lord jesus christ this morning amen may we sing that song in the presence of jehovah this morning god is so rich and his mercies endure to all generations we want his mercy this morning we don't want his judgment let's just worship him this morning just just a moment before we change the order of the service here today we very excited about the things of god today and we know that it's in his presence the miracles are done [Music] amen in the [Music] presence oh god oh my god you're my princess peace oh my troubles vanish [Applause] [Music] in the presence [Music] at me oh all day long i struggle [Music] ago for the answers that i need [Music] but then i come into its brand all my questions [Music] no doubt can it turn [Music] the presence [Music] oh god oh my you're my prince of my peace they fannies hallelujah and hearts are meant [Music] is the king i tell you when you're standing in his presence and feel like you can take on a giant i'd say we could kind of catch a little bit of a glimpse what david felt like when he walked down in that valley and he knew he was going to come out of there winning i love it how the prophet said that he didn't even have to pray through because he was prayed through before the foundation of the world i just like to tell you this morning you're going to win i'd like to tell you this morning you're going to make it i like to tell you by him all things are possible i told you last night that 2020 was a perfect set up for miracles and our theme has been that this year that god is with us and we will see miracles i have to say we've seen miracles and i i can't get that smile off my face because because we're in his presence and when we're in his presence there's fullness of joy i tell you when you're in his presence good things happen the bible says in psalms 145 i will extol thee my god o king i will bless thy name forever and ever every day i will bless thee and i will praise thy name forever and ever great is the lord and greatly to be praised and his greatness is unsearchable one generation shall praise thy works to another and shall declare thy mighty acts i will speak of the glorious honor of thy majesty and of thy wondrous works i will be one of those that will speak of his wondrous works what about you today this morning will you speak of his wondrous works now 2020 i can't even just as a whole of our body collectively here there's no way physically that i'm able to be able to draw everything out but how many has been a part of a miracle this past year i'm going to do something that i said i wouldn't do but i'd like the brothers to turn the camera on our congregation just for now and you keep your hands up but you've been a part of a miracle those that are watching by the way the internet i want you to look at all of these miracles that have happened and if these miracles can happen for them they can happen for you we're in the presence of the lord where all things are possible and satan has done his absolute best to stop the move of god and he's done his worst to keep us from believing that all things are possible but i believe that there is a people on earth today that believe more than god is able but they believe that god will fulfill his promise and that he will keep his word and i believe that we are that people that we are the generation that will speak of the wondrous things of god and 2020 has been a showdown between satan and god and i want to tell the bride of jesus christ that god will win time and time and time and time and time again and no matter what the enemy throws on us we will always come out winning so he can throw sickness he can throw torment he can throw doubt he can throw interference but god's already got it all worked out for his good this is the year of miracles and our god is still in the miracle working business if the brothers could hit the lights for me back there and back before the brothers pay post this this picture i want to read this testimony to you this morning we got this we got this email several months ago well more than nine months ago it's a testimony from newfoundland canada as his brother he is here when i asked you to pray for us after four miscarriages you said send pictures god bless you for your prayers my brothers i did not know you were in a battle of your own when i reached out to pray for my pray out to you for prayer brother i pray you and your family and your church every day we will see miracles and i believe that applies to you as well brother you said send pictures and it lifted my faith soul brother i look forward to a testimony and a visit to newfoundland at some time if it be god's will god bless you brother chad collins from newfoundland canada and here is an introduction to baby joshua david collins we will see miracles hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord this is the year of miracles if it can happen for him it can happen for you i want you to take a look around this morning this morning is a different it's out of the ordinary ordinary today's we're going to get out of the orthodox of things but i want you to let yourself loose to believe for the impossibles that you got a part to play this morning and if god's got a part for you to be a part of these miracles let's just enter in this morning hallelujah give the lord praise hallelujah hallelujah i want you to prepare for your miracle take a picture take a picture hallelujah all things are possible to them that believe sure we've been through some battles but you cannot have a victory without a battle we've been through some battles this year as the bride of jesus christ but we're coming out on the other side victorious amen do you love the lord this morning are you ready for all things he's given us all things so why shouldn't we expect all things i don't know what you came to the house of prayer for this morning but i believe that if you'll go to lifting up holy hands this morning and begin to praise the lord jesus as the word goes forth that the holy ghost can fall on your life and your situation to your needs if he can bring a baby to a to a to a womb that had four miscarriages what can he do in your soul this morning oh let him have a supernatural birth in your life this morning let him have his supernatural way in your life as your pastor speaks this morning realize that you are hearing through a miracle this morning that you are hearing the word of god through a voice that the enemy wanted to shut down but satan we got bad news the voice has not been stopped [Music] amen amen amen only believe all things are possible before we turn it over hallelujah oh only believe if you only [Music] believe that all things are possible if you only [Music] believe believe if you only [Music] believe that all things are possible who only [Music] is here god's servant brother ron spencer [Music] g [Music] jesus jesus is here [Music] jesus all things are possible jesus [Applause] is god bless you well that ought to give you faith to to rise like never before amen i remember i remember when that request came in and i just you know so thankful that what god knows exactly what he's doing and amen send pictures amen i'll never forget one time in germany the lord spoke to me and a lady was coming through the prayer line and and she was without a child and god just spoke to me he said ask her how many she wants and they thought boy that was strange and i did and she said three and it hit me there was a prophet that asked for squirrels and he said three i'll take three amen amen as far as i know she has won now that's only been just a couple of years so she's got one she's on her way amen i was walking through a hallway and in a church in ohio and one of the sisters told me she said brother ron you prayed for me many years ago that i'd have a child i couldn't have children and i said well how many do you have and she said six [Laughter] am i it worked amen god bless you we so love you this morning and uh we we so appreciate everything that god is doing and we're so thankful for each and every one of you and um we we send we send our hellos to canada as well and also brother joe green's church that is that is uh streaming this morning so because of the cobit situations and we send our love to them and there will be better days and we're just thankful for his goodness and we greet you in we greet you in canada as well and we certainly love you with all of our hearts i just have something on my heart this morning that i just want to deliver to you and i don't know quite how to do it but i i want to just do my best the music is more important than the struggle is that going to be okay the music is more important than the struggle and the music being god's word it's more important than the struggle amen and that will be our title this morning i have spoken the muse i have spoken a sermon in in times past on the the hurt will not stop the music but i want to look with a different emphasis this morning on on the music is more important than the struggle isaiah chapter 55 and verse 5. isaiah 55 and 5. amen you love the lord this morning amen someday i'll tell you what just happened there someday behold thou shalt call call a nation that thou knowest not and nations that knew not thee shall run unto thee because of of the lord thy god for the holy one of israel for he hath glorified thee seek ye the lord while he may be found and call ye upon him while he is near let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the lord for he will have mercy upon him and to our god for he will abundantly pardon for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my way saith the lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and returneth not thither but watereth the earth and maketh it bring forth and bud that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater and so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth and it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which i please and it shall prosper in the thing where to i sent it amen you may be seated and may the lord bless the reading of his word god's word said is god is speaking to us in your in our humanity and he says your thoughts for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither your ways my ways sometimes we get so bottled in our human thoughts we can't see the big picture i think about a young man a young family that's sitting here just now and they're down praying about moving moving and god just directs them to come here and they don't really know who i am they don't know me they know me by distant association and god's got a plan he's got a plan and they come and we go out after service one night and we sit beside of each other and pizza have pizza together and i'm thinking these kids what are they going to move here for i drove by their house a few moments ago and i looked up and the scripture came to me in their prayer meeting in their humble little home back home there's no way that they could see where they would be today i want you to understand it there's no way you could see where you would be today in that spot but that was a moment that god began to say i've got some plans for you [Music] i got some plans for you and so here you look you look and i drove by this morning and god would speak to me as i was driving by and these thoughts were coming and and this is the evolving thought your house is being done the trees are being renovated things are happening god had a plan and he put a driving force on the inside of that sure there was struggles sure there was things that had to be moved and shaken and thoughts and opinions but it's not about the struggle brother branham and this has been on my heart for this week brother branham is singing a song in one of his last meetings and as he's singing a song and he's just coming to the end he's he's preached a service called on the wings of a snow white dove he has been asked to tame it down in the meeting he has been asked to uh kind of allow the doctrines to kind of you know be put backwards they they really didn't want to get that they didn't want the doctrines they they they they didn't want to hear invisible union of the bride and they didn't want to hear god's chosen place of worship and would you would you would you go back and preach one of those sermons a lamb in the dove maybe it was because the church was rejecting the message and so brother branham comes and he preaches on the wings of a snow white dove and he describes to us that how that dove was released in the time of war and how that they shot at it and they shot at it and maybe it was wounded a bit and and then and then he comes down to the end and he sings a song and under inspiration now he he puts a verse with it and we sing it and we kind of think that that verse went with it all the time but he's singing he's singing a song with it and we know it we know that on the wings of a snow white dove god sends his pure sweet love a sign from above on the wings of a dove though i have suffered in many a way i cried for healing both night and day faith wasn't forgotten by the father above he sent me a sign on the wings of a dove on the wings yes pure sweet love a sign from above on the wings of don't you understand that his presence is here you're in the presence of a living god not a man but a real god who didn't live only 2 000 years ago but lives tonight right here right here in this presence now i wonder sometimes when we come to church do we catch the point of all the people in the earth were gathered to this spot we're gathered to this chosen place where god wants to come and be with his people i'm reminded of just as the scriptures are in chronological order i'm reminded as brother brandon would come to meetings as a messenger of god oh he was a man but he had a message that would deliver the the people i studied all day thursday we we were on vacation this week and it's our week of vacation but i was driven thirsty on a thought and it just it just would not leave me i i just had to grab a hold of it and i had to had to had to get a hold of it for this day and the message that we have in this day will translate us and put us in a rapture are you with me that's what separates us from every every church entity and every every group of people that has a steeple or a cross or or a worship center the message that was sent it is the music that will translate our life it was the opening of the scripture of the bible and it was like it was like glasses to the bible six for for thousands of years we'd been blinded [Applause] but the message didn't bring us a new book [Applause] it only opened the book [Applause] and it allowed us to fall in love with the with the author of the book are you with me you can't separate it it allowed us to fall in love and and and the message wasn't sent for us to fall in love with brother branham though that's a good thing are you with me and and i'm not wanting you to not fall in love with him but he's not who you're marrying are you with me he's not who you're marrying you're marrying christ [Applause] are you with me and brother branham and his personal struggles and and as he would come along that way he would drop certain things about his personal complexes and his personal struggles and how he was raised as a bootlegger's son and and the difficulties of his wife dying and he and his child dying and and the difficulties of of the the men that were around him that would turn him down and take things away from him and he just loved him anyway and here was a man with the most powerful gifts since jesus christ and let me just say it was more than a gift it was more than a gift it was the messiah sign to this generation to vindicate the word and he would not sell out for money popularity [Music] or schools to be built or or compromise and he he would not turn around i believe that there's come men under the message with the same anointing and they will have personal struggles and they will have difficulties and they will have to go through things but they refuse to compromise or sell out or kingdom build the message is not about making stars out of preachers or even people it's the message is the emphasis of the word to transport our body as the queen of heaven that's the finishing of redemption that for 2 000 years men and women have lived the word and went into the ground looking for rapture under great difficulty brother nathanael but they went down in faith believe it just as when jesus was on the earth there was a lot of multitudes but there was a handful of believers i want you to catch that phrase there was a lot of multitudes but there was a handful of believers a lot of people attended brother branham's meetings for a lot of different reasons and he would preach sermons and i'm just going to give you the titles but sermons like modern events things that are to be the seven seals opened up the entire bible then he would preach indictment say i couldn't have done this 20 years ago or 10 years ago but i can do it now then he would preach sermons a series like the trial and he would conduct a trial right in church then he would speak a future home and it would open up that what our home was going to be like when we got there no doubt to the people that were gathered as a multitude a four-hour service was a little much but to the bride he's talking about my home when he's speaking sermons like why christ speak and he's beginning to stand there and tell us that faith is a long vision keep your focus the word will hold right on the target then he comes and speaks christ is the mystery of god revealed and how that the preeminence of the entire word or the entire bible is on jesus christ a few weeks ago i spoke on who is jesus because the nominal world still don't know who he was are you with me they still don't realize who he was and they don't realize that he's came again in this day to display himself to the bride of christ and make her a promise i'm coming to get you are you with me and speak sermons like chosen place of worship how he bypassed all the great big cathedrals and their great big schools and their great big education and their fine boards and their their finery systems because jesus came to their place and they wanted no part he speaks sermons like god is his own interpreter what are you saying brother ron every one of those sheets of music was important every one of those sermons was important every one of them was important and he had to leave himself out of it because he wasn't the important one the music was the important one yes he had struggles but the music was the important one mary was standing there with an angel in luke chapter one and verse 30 and i know you've heard it redundantly throughout your life in verse 30 the angel said unto her fear not mary for thou has found favor with god i want to say this to you you said in here this morning i don't know if you measure the appreciation of having found favor with god i have just made a phenomenal statement because if you found favor with him it affects every phase of your life did you catch what i just said if you found favor with him and you realize that you found favor with god the infinite god that knows exactly how many animals fleas ticks whatever he knows everything and how the universe rolls and yet he's concerned about your needs his eyes are on the sparrow and i know he's watching over me that god is concerned about you and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and call his name jesus and he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the lord god shall give unto him the throne of his father david and he shall reign over the house of jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end all right watch this and mary said unto the angel how shall this be seen i know not a man and the angel answered and said under the holy ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that holy thing which shall be borne of thee shall be called the son of god it's as though was the angel saying as he's speaking it he's going for taking all the prophecies even since adam and speaking to her it's not an if this is not an if are you catching what i'm doing here this is not an if his kingdom will not end he's going to be the son of the highest his name shall be called jesus and his kingdom there shall be no end verse 36 and behold thy cousin elizabeth she has also conceived a son in her old age and this is the six months with her who was called baron now notice these words he's not only conscious of mary's womb but he's very much conscious of what's going on with elizabeth in the same meeting are you with me now and he he now knows that elizabeth was barren for with god nothing shall be impossible now notice how mary responds she does not respond with the struggle are you with me she does not respond with the struggle immediately she must in her humanity must know if i'm caught with a child before i'm married they'll stone me they'll call me a matter of names which they did do she didn't look at the the problems that she was going to have to face and go i can't do the job i'm preaching to you now i'm preaching to you now all of your list of excuses god says they don't matter all of your pettiness and all of your nonsense and all of the things that you say i can't make it through it don't matter no way why don't you just tell the devil of all of your humanity struggle it don't matter are you with me sometimes we look at the and here are going to go sometimes we look that mary is going to deliver the child to the world but the big picture was the word that she was bringing forth was going to deliver her hallelujah hallelujah it would deliver her black it would sustain her she would be given the opportunity to carry the child all of their nonsense and all of their making fun and at no point whatsoever did she have to help god [Applause] at no point do you have to help god here just enjoy him just radiate in his presence oh i feel like just enjoy the word of god and let it live just eat the book eat the book and the word will begin to develop on the inside of your life it will bring forth because remember it wasn't part mary and port part god remember it wasn't part mary impart god it was all god [Applause] are you with me it was all god from that point she was pregnant from that point she was pregnant from that point she was given a testimony i'm carrying a child it didn't matter what joseph said it didn't matter what elizabeth said it didn't matter what the high priest said she was carrying the christ child [Applause] it don't matter what they say about the message i don't have to help the message that message is helping me the message will live on its own i don't have to pop it up i don't have to prime it up i don't have to decorate it up it'll live on its own come on church it will give me a rapture it'll change my body it'll give you the right kind of home it'll give you the right kind of character it'll give are you with me now hallelujah i was given the opportunity to stand in a church in china it was an open-air church at really cold temperatures where we wrap blankets around ourselves to keep warm coats we put them on i preached there and brother murphy we were coming through and they were reaching out for me and i said what are they saying murphy said just keep walking just keep walking i'll tell you later the police were outside the police actually came inside took pictures the pastor of that church was a man named caleb there was a woman that had been the pastor of that church before but when she heard the message she immediately resigned and caleb was there as a young minister he took the church and he began to pastor that group and when i went to preach for him he was involved in making sure that bibles got where they needed to get and messages got where it got it needed to get and re the translations were getting where they needed to be and he was a fervent young man as many of you know for the last few months he's been in prison along with a couple of other brothers there's been a couple of brothers that have been released and we can't tell you how that that happened but we just thank the lord that it happened to this point this is now two or three months brother caleb hasn't had one shower he has not been able to bathe one time he has not been able to have one stable meal a day since that time but last week he wrote his wife a letter and he says my dear wife don't be afraid no matter what the result might be good or bad i was led here by revelation it's not our faith can accomplish but our faith toward him can accomplish everything i love you tell everyone what they were before this happened that they should be the same right now are you listening to me even in my absence god is still god god is not mocked live right let our hearts be pure single-eyed don't let my love don't let my heart grease for all of you while i'm in here we must prepare ourselves at any time and every time brother neal who has been entrusted with the church who was arrested with him but bailed out build real true watchmen rebuke sin urging people to have a zeal of repentance they don't need to worry about me at all write more letters to brother ping and encourage him and the brother in jail with brother caleb but they they can't meet each other now notice how he's doing it he's he's telling them now don't connect you get in trouble but the most important thing is to assert assist brother murphy in the translations work and do it right my heart and my spirit are always with you and pray for you may the lord keep you after all the trials stand brother neal be focused don't be distracted visit the old saints did you hear any pity me did you hear any pity me this week i got a couple of excuses about why why their people are just you know you know i'm it's not even worth telling you let me just say this to you god will have a bride he will have a bride he will have a symphony he will have people that will be there that will stand the music will be played somebody ought to help me preach brother branham will talk about in shalom andrew's last quote last night was out of shalom and good morning and brother branham talks about peter and the wolf and how that that conductor and how that director he gets in the inspiration of that conductor and uh and and the man that wrote it that composed the music he had a certain inspiration and he wanted to be written a certain way these men were absolute mastermind that were gifts to be able to to put music together and it still boggles the mind of some of the greatest musicians in the world how they could arrange certain things and make it to go go together in a certain way and then if you write if you read the books about the men that were the composer many of them like beethoven became to became deaf so he would cut the the the legs off of his piano so he could hear it against the floor and he would play and it was in some of that time that he produced the best music but the struggle was not greater than the music helen keller's struggle was not greater than what she accomplished in life fanny crosby her blindness was not greater are you with me it was not greater than what she would accomplish in her life your struggles are not greater than the message of the hour [Applause] jesus was standing in a meeting and he was standing there and it's only hours days before he's going to be beaten like no other human being sent through a trial like no other human being and sit before a public offering of who will you take a rioter a murderer or jesus and the public outcry was we choose baramus what you don't understand it's repeating again in this day not just in america they're headed toward a one-world system and it's not democrat or republican you stick around long enough your politics is going to just fall away and become rotten are you with me now listen listen they're going to have a pope as a leader before long it won't be the candidates that you're going to vote on in 2020 it won't matter no way they're going to have a leader we're going to be gone now before all of these events that are going to happen in jesus because the word is saying and he's pressing towards it garden of gethsemane is right in front of him now jesus has a meeting with his disciples and this is going to be a very important meeting and he says let not your heart be troubled i think that sometimes what we ought to be hearing and get your eyes on what's going on here you believe in god believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions and brother brown said he's not talking about brick and mortar and stone and wood here he's talking about your eternal home and why was it important brother nathaniel that he would talk about their their their heavenly home because for some of these boys they were going to be drugged through the street they were going to be beheaded they were going to be turned upside down and crucified the personal struggle that they were going to have to go through jesus was pointing them beyond that struggle and when they realized you can destroy this body well brother ron what's jesus worth i'd say everything when these men that had stood there with him and saw these miracles and saw these things when they received the same life that was inside of him though today they couldn't understand this sermon when he's telling them don't be troubled you believe in god believe also in me i am the way i am the truth i am the life there's not another way there's not 10 000 ways i am the way this is not up for negotiation i am the way and when those boys are standing there and they're going to they're going to watch these things happen and now they go to an upper room and i'm sorry to be discombobulated here just for a moment but these men are going to go through a vacuum of struggles of mental thoughts how can these things be people walking away people screaming people screaming crucify him when he's healed they're sick he's raised they're dead he's fed they're four and five thousand they've seen nothing but good they cannot comprehend the redemption story that is happening among them it is only later that they can look back to digest some of those things andrew put it so well they were hit in a cave for 10 days they were hit away waiting because they knew i can't live this on my own you put that so well last night so sometimes in the darkness we we kind of molt we kind of sent to a place in our life to where we realize i can't do this amen i personally can't do this and if you haven't went through that i'll tell you as a real christian you gotta have it because it's gonna take more than human energy i can hold myself brother ron really well brother on i can be this way at church and with other people i can be another way really really well that's called hollywood that's truly a mask that you put on on sunday and you put another mask on the other days but at the end of the trip i'll tell you what people will appreciate the most is the person that's real every day are you with me if your music changes i'm sorry i'm tracing something here if your music changes from today till tomorrow here's an altar if your clothing changes from here to tomorrow here's an altar if you think that your friends out there are the most important friends that you've got in life here's an altar people love the nakedness of this world but i'll tell you where there's another place that's going to be naked it's called hell there's no clothes there as a matter of fact you're going to get a new body to go through hell you get the same one you're in now there's no friends in hell brother on but you were so positive for a while well let me just tell you this this is what god came to save you from that's what the music is about to save you from this kind of a lifestyle you play your nonsense backwards of music and you get your wife back your dog back you get your old card back you get your best friends back and jesus was telling them my thoughts are higher than your thoughts my words are greater than your words now what we do sometimes is we look at our personal struggles that we're in and we get depressed and they overwhelm us and we get bottled aware that it's our problem our little problem listen to me very closely now i won't be much longer maybe i'll have to preach again next week but how many of you get so consumed with your little itty-bitty problem until you'll go through a deal and you for weeks will be so bottlenecked until you can't see nothing but you am i am i with you are you with me i had a sister one time in oh in a different country she said i was consumed with constipation and she was very sincere she had been a christian for decades and she said i was concerned with constipation and said it was it drew it drove me nuts in my life until i began to worship the lord and i figured out that when i would worship the lord everything worked well i know i know that can bring a smile to our thoughts but let me just say this to you when you put god first when you put god first in your life he's greater than your cancer he's greater than your tuberculosis here's greater than your petty problems in your life he's greater than the prison that you're in brother caleb he's greater he's greater than all that now you know you just don't go to a symphony and just start playing first of all you have to be chosen you just don't show up at the national symphony with your flute your drum your whatever you play and go i want to play here where's your invitation to play well i i want to play i'm sorry this is just a chosen group you know sometimes people go you guys think you're the only ones no we got the letter we got the letter i received an invitation to be a part of this there's a lot of people want to be a part of it but i got the invitation it was on the inside of me when i looked at this i couldn't see nothing else i got the invitation it's been vindicating itself for decades now i couldn't make myself this i tried i tried i couldn't make myself this i just let it live now whether it's a flute or a drum in the national symphony because i had a cousin that was involved in that and she would go a few times a year to play they would send her they would send her music that they were going to play and so i'm going to parallel here for about five minutes can you hang with me and you see in that realm they send you the music that you're going to play you don't choose the music that you want to play they send you the music that you're gonna play and every part has a key part it's not up for you to change it or whether you think that it's it would be better here or there just play what's on the sheets and like elijah and elisha and brother brandon preach a second-hand robe god does not trim the robe to fit elisha he trims elisha to fit the rope god's not going to change his word for you it's you that are going to be changed to fit the word out it's not you're looking for a church that'll fit you we're not a bunch of politicians are here patting you on the back or tickling your ears we're not gonna beg you bribe you pull on you we're not going to call you 52 times on monday where was you at where was you at listen you ought to have enough god in your life to get your stinking self up out of bed i'm gonna preach now for a little while there ought to be enough god on the inside of you this is time for me to go to church and when i get there i'm going to have church i'm not worried about who i'm sitting with i'm not worried about what everybody else is doing i come to have an encounter with jesus christ i come to worship the lord i come to have a meeting i come to play my part in the music hallelujah hallelujah i fell in love with jesus a long time ago and i may have had to go through some struggles in my life but my struggles were not greater they are not greater than the god that lays on the inside of me let freedom ring let freedom ring let the music sound in my life let it sound let the message echo this ain't no pity party i have drove off of this hill for 20 years i have never said going off of this hill look what so-and-so was wearing on my conversation going home these girls can tell you i don't talk about who wasn't here brother ron did you miss me you didn't think it was important to be here i'm gonna preach to who is here and i'm going to have church you don't want to have church i'm going to have church even if i've been through hell all week long and sick in this body i come on sunday morning to have church i'm not interested in talking to you about how many times i throwed up and how many times i got nauseated how much medicine i take every morning how much i take it now i want to tell you about jesus loves me [Applause] i want to tell you he loves me so much he came from glory and he reached down and grabbed the hulk of my life and he transformed me so i could hear the music hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah sometimes you need to hear the music that's coming out of the other end of your instrument i want you to hear the music that's coming out the other end hallelujah it ain't all about me it ain't all about you it's all about him did you hear that it ain't all about you and it ain't all about me it's all about him i'm gonna say it one more time it ain't all about you and it ain't all about me it's all about him [Applause] now i want you to look over you don't be scared of your neighbor look over you spaced out right look over and tell them what i just told you now what that will do is once you figure that out it'll get rid of your jealousy he'll get rid of your amber it'll get rid of your nonsense and your little old petty junk i'm having way too much fun this made me too this may be too much fun for even the canadians now hang on with me it'll get rid of your jealousy it'll get rid of your little house big house syndrome whether you realize it if you're driving a golf cart or the best mercedes being in here i don't care [Applause] cause it ain't about your car and it ain't about your house and it ain't about your job your 10 is 10 no matter what it is it's about you and god and at the end of the day this message that has been so powerfully preached lives in your life that on rapture mourning there's not a devil in hell can do to stop the music from flowing through i'm getting ready to finish and this is gonna be good this is gonna be good now you see if you was invited to go to an orchestra i actually had that privilege one time in my life and i went and i sat down and i watched it and i thought i was just i was just blown apart you know i noticed as i look back on it you know they came out they all was doing their deals and they was warming up they all took their places first chair took the place and then the complimentary to the first chair took their place and they were all sitting down you know i watched it none of those people stood up and said you know what i overcome to get here none of them got up and told their life story before the symphony they just warmed up because they've been doing that at home there was a guy with a stick there's a guy with a stick this will probably be one of the most popular sticks in the world now and he walks out there and there comes a time and so many times won't people want the rapture before it's actually time but you see there's some seats that still got to be filled and sister judy we had to wait on you we had to wait on you we thought we'd make a rapture 20 years ago we had to wait on you because you had to play your part and some of you children we had to wait on you to get here because you came from the lamb's book and you had to be manifested on the earth and god's not going to lose a one he's so interested in you all of this great symphony every seat's got to be [Applause] filled [Music] and yes some of us been waiting for almost 1900 years to play their part and they've been telling their stories and they've been doing all of this but some of us final ones are coming to the spot everybody gets quiet now what happened to all the struggle all of that's now behind us all of the struggles now behind us and we're sitting quietly and the cancer that i went through and the burns that i've went through and the heart attacks and the strokes and the problems and i'm sitting in my chair and it's just me and the music now [Music] and everybody's quiet in the crowd and he turns everybody's at attention and he starts waving the stick because the stick will have no miscues and the director and the composer are in the same spirit through seven ages and they begin to play what a day that will be when my jesus i shall see when i look upon his face the one who saved me by his grace and it echoes through the halls an amazing grace is played and maybe there were certain parts you didn't get to play well don't you worry he's got a part for you and he flips a page and he kind of looks at you a certain way and maybe in the whole bible you can only find one scripture so shamgar is important to play because you see you are important to god amen you didn't think carrying out trees would be quite like this did you maybe you thought well i'm just gonna tire those trees out there they're broke broken but this morning god told me when i spoke to them to move i had plans it did great to be a part of his plans and then he comes to your part you have heard of little
