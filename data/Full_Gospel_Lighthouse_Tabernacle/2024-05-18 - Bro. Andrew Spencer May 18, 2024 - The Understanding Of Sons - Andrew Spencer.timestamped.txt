[41:23] um we'll just sing a song after this but
[41:25] I I just want to take a just take a
[41:27] moment real quick and um take take uh
[41:31] some pastorally things here and just
[41:33] kind of speak some things we we have our
[41:35] meeting coming up and uh in in labor day
[41:38] and we're very excited about that and uh
[41:41] we'll be printing out a flyer and
[41:43] putting it on the church Facebook before
[41:45] long and we have those times we're
[41:47] having to adjust our times just a little
[41:49] bit especially on Saturday night just
[41:51] according to the way that the Lord's
[41:53] leading and and so we're just we're
[41:55] going to we'll make you all aware of
[41:57] that all at the same time but I just
[41:59] wanted just to um make this announcement
[42:02] not necessarily he for some of you but
[42:04] not necessarily for you but more or less
[42:07] for for those that might be planning to
[42:10] come in might hear this and we we
[42:12] certainly appreciate everybody that
[42:14] would come in for our meetings and uh
[42:17] but these meetings are for you man when
[42:20] it comes down in all reality these
[42:21] meetings are for you and uh I just want
[42:25] to say something I don't want I don't
[42:27] want anybody that would hear this to
[42:28] ever think that that that I'm we're
[42:31] being rude and don't think it's rude
[42:33] when somebody doesn't offer up their
[42:34] house uh for you to come and stay in it
[42:38] it they're not being rude we are some of
[42:39] the most hospitable people here at Full
[42:42] Gospel Lighthouse and uh it was a
[42:44] standard that was created and started
[42:47] with our former Pastor brother Homer
[42:48] Frasier he started that we didn't we
[42:51] didn't open up our homes and just let
[42:53] anybody and everybody just come in and
[42:54] flood the flood our homes because
[42:58] uh you know every church is different
[43:00] every church is Sovereign in their own
[43:01] way but brother Homer seen some things
[43:03] and we have found it to be a great
[43:04] policy that you keep your homes you keep
[43:07] your homes keep some issues don't have
[43:09] to worry about anything being said about
[43:10] your young people you don't have to
[43:11] worry about anything being said about
[43:13] about yourself you wasn't hospital about
[43:15] those things so don't think that these
[43:17] people ain't rude when you're asking
[43:18] them if they if they could stay if
[43:20] they're asking you if you could stay
[43:22] with them you just telling them that
[43:23] brother Ron and brother Andrew are still
[43:25] carry on the same tradition that brother
[43:26] Homer did
[43:27] and if you would like to be a part of
[43:29] these meetings and you're streaming
[43:30] these meetings and you don't have the
[43:32] money to come that's why the streaming
[43:34] is there if you can't afford a hotel

[43:38] want you to come if you're wanting to
[43:40] come we we want you to come and be a
[43:42] part of it and I believe that this

[49:12] just begin to take the word of life and
[49:14] break it to us in the name of Jesus
[49:16] Christ amen and amen Luke chapter 17
[49:20] verse 28 likewise also as it was in the
[49:25] days of lot they did eat and they drank
[49:28] and they bought and they sold and they
[49:30] planted they build it but the same day
[49:34] that lot went out of Sodom it rained
[49:36] fire and brimstone from heaven and
[49:39] destroyed them all even thus shall it be
[49:43] in the day when the son of man is
[49:46] revealed also John chapter 6 and verse
[49:51] 44 and I know this this this reading
[49:55] that we're getting ready to take here
[49:56] it's a little bit lengthy but I I want
[49:58] to keep you standing just so you you'll
[50:02] fully I'll I'll have your full attention
[50:05] so so you just bear with us here this
[50:08] evening and don't just let me read it
[50:10] you read it as well amen no man John 6
[50:14] and44 no man can come to me except the
[50:17] Father which hath sent me draw him and I
[50:19] will raise him up at the last day it is
[50:22] written in the prophets that they shall
[50:24] be all taught of God every man therefore
[50:28] that hath heard and ha learned of the
[50:30] father cometh unto me now that not that
[50:34] any man hath seen the father save he
[50:36] which is of god he hath seen the father
[50:39] verily verily I say unto you he that
[50:41] believeth on me hath everlasting life I
[50:44] am that bread of life your fathers did
[50:47] eat Mana in the wilderness and are dead
[50:50] this is the bread which cometh down from
[50:52] heaven that a man may eat thereof and
[50:55] not die now you got to think this is
[50:58] something they've never been able to
[50:59] partake of they've been feeding on it
[51:02] but didn't realize what they were
[51:03] feeding on he said I am the living bread
[51:06] which cometh down from heaven and if any
[51:09] man eat of this bread he shall live
[51:11] forever and the bread that I will give
[51:14] is my flesh which I will give for the
[51:17] life of the world now notice what it is
[51:20] his his flesh is his life the Jews
[51:24] therefore strove amongst them saying how
[51:26] can this man give us his flesh to eat
[51:29] and then Jesus said unto them verily
[51:31] verily I say unto you except you eat the
[51:33] Flesh of the son of man and drink his
[51:36] blood you have no life in you notice
[51:38] just to just to put it out there for you
[51:40] this was his prophetic Ministry except
[51:43] you eat the Flesh of the son of man and
[51:45] drink his blood you shall have no life
[51:47] in you and whosoever who Who whoo eateth
[51:50] my flesh and drinketh my blood hath
[51:53] eternal life and I will raise him up at
[51:55] the last day for my flesh is meat indeed
[51:58] and my blood is drink indeed and he that
[52:00] eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood
[52:02] dwelleth in me and I in him as the
[52:04] living father have sent me I live by the
[52:07] father so he that eateth me even shall
[52:10] live by me this is that bread which came
[52:13] down from heaven not as your fathers did
[52:14] eat mana and are de he that eateth of
[52:18] this bread shall live forever these
[52:21] things said he in the synagogue as he
[52:23] taught in capernium many therefore of
[52:25] his disciples when they heard this said
[52:28] this is a hard saying who can hear it
[52:30] and when Jesus knew in himself that his
[52:33] disciples murmured at it he said unto
[52:35] them do this offend you what and if you
[52:38] shall see the son of man Ascend where he
[52:41] was before it is the spirit that
[52:44] quickeneth the Flesh propit of nothing
[52:47] the words that I speak unto you they are
[52:49] spirit and they are life but there are
[52:52] some of you that believe not for Jesus
[52:54] knew from the beginning who they were
[52:56] that believe not and who should betray
[52:59] him and he said therefore I said unto
[53:01] you that no man can come unto me except
[53:05] it were given unto him of my father and
[53:08] from that time many of his disciples
[53:11] went back and walk no more with him we
[53:15] know that that is a sign of the mark of
[53:17] the beast to reject the word of God
[53:20] right there then said Jesus unto the 12
[53:24] will you also go away then Simon Peter
[53:27] answered him Lord to whom shall we go
[53:31] thou Hast the words of eternal life and
[53:33] we believe and ass sure that thou art
[53:36] the Christ the son of the Living God may
[53:40] God bless his word you may be seated
[53:42] tonight in the presence of the Lord so
[53:45] he said we'd like to speak to you
[53:46] tonight on the understanding of sons and
[53:48] the prophet would say in the anointed
[53:50] ones at the end time he said I wasn't
[53:52] the one that appeared down there on the
[53:53] river I was only standing there when he
[53:56] appeared I'm not the one that performs
[53:59] these things and foretells these things
[54:01] that's happened as perfectly as they are
[54:04] I'm only the one that's near when he
[54:06] does it I was only a voice that he used
[54:08] it wasn't what I knew it's just what I
[54:11] surrendered myself too that he spoke
[54:14] through it isn't me it isn't what the
[54:16] seventh angel oh no it was the
[54:19] manifestation of the son of man it
[54:21] wasn't the angel his message it was the
[54:23] mystery that God unfolded it's not a man
[54:26] it's God the angel was not the son of
[54:29] man he was the messenger from the son of
[54:31] man the son of man is Christ he is the
[54:34] one that you're feeding on you're not
[54:36] feeding on a man a man his words will
[54:39] fail but you're feeding on the unfailing
[54:42] body word of the son of man if you
[54:45] haven't fed fully on every word to give
[54:47] yourself strength to Fly Above All these
[54:49] denominations and things of the world
[54:51] will you let will you at this time do it
[54:55] while we pray and I know that's a very
[54:57] familiar scripture to us as as Believers
[54:59] but we recognize and I I think it's very
[55:02] incredible when you begin to measure the
[55:04] magnitude that the message has had on
[55:06] each and every one of us I believe it's
[55:08] I believe it's it's it's uh it's
[55:10] incredible to look at it not only from a
[55:13] a believer's aspect from an unbelievers
[55:15] aspect to think about how the word of
[55:18] God has affected Us in every one of our
[55:21] lives and we recognize that we're either
[55:23] going to be justified or we're going to
[55:25] be classified with either one of the
[55:27] class of groups whether a Believer a
[55:29] makeb Believer or an unbeliever and I
[55:32] know exactly what side that I want to be
[55:34] identified with and I I I believe that I
[55:36] believe that as the prophet would say he
[55:38] said he said where you're standing at
[55:40] now is where you'd be standing at back
[55:43] there when Jesus was here 2,000 years
[55:45] ago that's the class that you'll find
[55:48] yourself and there were many of people
[55:49] that walk with Jesus even Jud even Judas
[55:52] was a was a make believer right all the
[55:54] way up to the end he held the he held
[55:56] the bag he was a treasur he was somebody
[55:58] that was really close but but God knows
[56:00] exactly who is and who is not and there
[56:03] when Jesus is standing here in in John
[56:06] chapter 6 he he's standing there and his
[56:08] own disciples are saying unto him said
[56:10] this is a hard saying and from that time
[56:13] you begin to see that that from that
[56:15] time that men would begin to walk away
[56:18] from Jesus you see you've got to think
[56:20] about this from the aspect that they
[56:22] were setting in as Jews that they were
[56:24] setting in that this was a hard saying
[56:26] because there they've been studying out
[56:28] the levitical priesthood they've been
[56:29] studying out the levitical law and Moses
[56:32] had had gotten a word from the Lord that
[56:34] no man should touch the flesh or touch
[56:37] blood or he would be condemned so here
[56:39] they were and Jesus is standing there
[56:42] and basically G by the words of a
[56:44] natural Man Without understanding Jesus
[56:46] is standing there and he's saying unless
[56:48] you're a vampire you can't you can't be
[56:50] no part of me but Jesus knew that there
[56:53] was some people that was standing there
[56:55] could fully understand what he was
[56:57] talking about because he wasn't talking
[56:58] about something carnal he wasn't talking
[57:01] about his flesh but he was talking about
[57:03] the ministry of the son of man and he
[57:05] knew that somebody was standing right
[57:07] there in the midst of all of them people
[57:09] when 70 of them walked away but Jesus
[57:12] knew that there was going to be 11 of
[57:13] them that would stand right there that
[57:15] was elected and anointed to understand
[57:17] the prophecy he was saying to them that
[57:20] you're literally eating the Prophecies
[57:23] of the son of man you're literally
[57:26] eating you see because you are elected
[57:28] to see these things is because the
[57:30] reason why you see these things we
[57:32] recognize that there's a group of people
[57:34] that God by forn knowledge has opened
[57:37] their eyes of understanding that they
[57:39] can see aren't you thankful that you've
[57:42] got eyesight to see now notice what Paul
[57:45] says in 2 Timothy 2 Timothy and 3 and
[57:48] verse1 14 he says but continue thou in
[57:52] the things which thou Hast learned and
[57:54] Hast been assured of knowing of whom
[57:57] thou Hast learned them you didn't learn
[57:58] this from you didn't learn this from
[58:00] some school you didn't learn this from
[58:02] some theology but Paul is saying these
[58:04] things he said be assured of who you've
[58:07] learned these things you didn't you
[58:08] didn't learn this from a mind of man but
[58:10] you've been feeding on the unfailing
[58:12] body word of the son of man because we
[58:14] recognize that all the way back there in
[58:16] the beginning that God had something
[58:18] that in the back part of his mind that
[58:20] he was going to achieve he had a motive
[58:22] that he was going to do he wanted to be
[58:24] a father he wanted to be a son he wanted
[58:26] to be a Healer and he had to express
[58:28] these things because they were on the
[58:29] inside of him but where did you get the
[58:32] understanding to realize that that kind
[58:33] of a God can be handled that that kind
[58:36] of a God wants to be touched that that
[58:38] kind of a God wants to be handled he
[58:40] wants to be
[58:41] understood but there are things about
[58:43] the supernatural that you and I will
[58:44] never understand because because it's
[58:47] simply Supernatural if it was if it
[58:49] wasn't Supernatural it would be natural
[58:51] and we would understand it but I thank
[58:53] God that there's a supernatural element
[58:55] that still leaves us to have faith to
[58:57] believe that that God is still God and I
[59:00] don't have to understand everything that
[59:02] he's doing in my life but I just simply
[59:04] have to believe him and he'll take me
[59:06] all the way through is that right now
[59:08] notice what he said in verse 15 he said
[59:10] and from and that from a child thou Hast
[59:12] known the holy
[59:14] scriptures which are able to make thee
[59:16] wise un salvation through faith which is
[59:20] in which is in Christ Jesus he says now
[59:23] notice verse 16 he said all scripture is
[59:26] is given by inspiration of God you study
[59:29] that word out in Inspiration in the
[59:30] Greek it means to it is breathed out all
[59:33] scripture is breathed out by the Breath
[59:36] of God and is profitable for Doctrine
[59:38] for Repro for correction for instruction
[59:42] in righteousness that the man of God
[59:43] might be perfect thoroughly furnished
[59:46] unto all good works and when Jesus is
[59:48] standing there in John chapter 6 he
[59:51] doesn't stand there and explain anything
[59:53] that he has just said unto them he
[59:54] simply just spoke spoke the word and he
[59:57] let it go out and he knew that there was
[59:59] going to be people that would believe
[1:00:01] him and when when he when he asked him
[1:00:03] said he said will you also turn away
[1:00:06] will you also leave me because of these
[1:00:08] hard sayings but Peter Peter stood up I
[1:00:11] think it's powerful to recognize that
[1:00:13] Peter had some Revelation he he had some
[1:00:16] mistakes but he had some Revelation and
[1:00:18] maybe maybe you maybe you're in that
[1:00:20] kind of situation yeah you got some
[1:00:22] mistakes but Peter had some Revelation
[1:00:24] you look at Peter's life there's all
[1:00:26] kinds of turmoil in Peter's life and I I
[1:00:28] love studying out the the the the the
[1:00:30] life of Simon Peter and you you find him
[1:00:32] he gets out of the boat he he was a man
[1:00:34] that just he was he was kind of on the
[1:00:36] cuff kind of guy just he just jumped out
[1:00:38] of the boat whenever he wanted to he was
[1:00:40] that kind of a guy just did he just did
[1:00:42] what came to his mind and he stepped out
[1:00:44] out there on the water and people a lot
[1:00:45] of people look on Peter's life and think
[1:00:47] man ain't no way I can identify with
[1:00:49] that guy I can there's sometimes that I
[1:00:51] there's sometimes that I I'm out there
[1:00:53] and I'm thinking Lord is that you out
[1:00:55] there and he said he said' if it is you
[1:00:57] bid me to come and he got out there and
[1:00:58] he started walking on water you know I I
[1:01:01] feel like sometimes I can identify with
[1:01:03] some of these characteristics in the
[1:01:04] Bible and a lot of people look on Peter
[1:01:06] and they look at him say Well look at
[1:01:07] that mistake he he lost his faith and he
[1:01:09] sunk back in the water but I always look
[1:01:10] on the back side of the story because he
[1:01:13] had enough Faith to get out of the boat
[1:01:14] but he also had enough Faith to get back
[1:01:16] in to step back on the water when Jesus
[1:01:19] took him by the hand but this time he
[1:01:21] didn't have his eyes on the water this
[1:01:22] time he didn't have his eyes on the Wind
[1:01:24] this time he didn't have his eyes on the
[1:01:26] problem this time he had a hold of the
[1:01:28] man's hand that was able to create a
[1:01:31] power to walk on H2O maybe he didn't
[1:01:34] understand while he was doing what he
[1:01:35] was doing but he was a man that was full
[1:01:37] of
[1:01:38] Faith Hallelujah and that's one thing
[1:01:41] that that's one thing you cannot do you
[1:01:43] cannot explain Faith you cannot explain
[1:01:45] it and if it could be explained then it
[1:01:47] would not be Faith but but there we
[1:01:49] recognize there we recognize that when
[1:01:52] Jesus starts saying all of these hard
[1:01:53] sayings he is saying it brother brandom
[1:01:56] said that he set it to weed down the
[1:01:58] crowd because there was too many down
[1:02:00] there with Gideon that fully didn't
[1:02:03] understand what battle that they were in
[1:02:04] so Jesus simply said a few of these
[1:02:06] things and it weeded down the crowd
[1:02:08] because there were some people that were
[1:02:10] simply following him just to watch some
[1:02:12] miracle of Ron Spencer get over cancer
[1:02:15] or or excuse me or maybe there were some
[1:02:17] people that was just simply walking
[1:02:18] around because of the bread and the
[1:02:20] fishes but there were some people so
[1:02:22] Jesus said some hard things so he begin
[1:02:25] to separate by the word of God and he
[1:02:27] found out where their allegiance was
[1:02:29] there was some people that was walking
[1:02:31] with him because they thought that he
[1:02:32] was going to over ever return Jerusalem
[1:02:35] and be a general and they were going to
[1:02:36] fight for him but they didn't understand
[1:02:38] that he was raising up a different type
[1:02:39] of Gentile
[1:02:41] Warrior he didn't explain himself he
[1:02:44] just simply he just simply said it and
[1:02:46] he just said it and there was some
[1:02:48] people there that believed it now
[1:02:51] there's some things that there's some
[1:02:52] things about the Bible that I could have
[1:02:54] I'm going to have to tell you I don't
[1:02:55] fully understand all those things I'm
[1:02:57] about to tell you there's some
[1:02:58] scriptures in here that maybe I don't
[1:03:00] fully understand but I believe that if I
[1:03:02] need to understand it then God will give
[1:03:04] me understanding for it I believe that
[1:03:06] there's some things in there that were
[1:03:07] laying to the Jews over there in
[1:03:09] Revelation 11 that they're not our that
[1:03:12] are not pertaining to me but I don't
[1:03:14] need that I don't need that them Jews
[1:03:17] need that but there is going to be two
[1:03:19] prophets rise up and preach to them
[1:03:21] their message and they'll have an
[1:03:23] understanding of where they are but
[1:03:24] there's some things in the scripture
[1:03:26] that you can that you can identify
[1:03:27] brother Andrew I've read them things
[1:03:29] over and over again and I fully don't
[1:03:31] understand all that's laying in there
[1:03:33] well I'm I I'm just here to tell you you
[1:03:35] don't have to understand everything just
[1:03:38] as long as you believe it's in there is
[1:03:40] that right I there's a saying that goes
[1:03:42] out I don't know I don't understand how
[1:03:44] a brown cow eats green grass drinks
[1:03:46] Clear Water produces yellow butter and
[1:03:49] gives out white milk I don't understand
[1:03:51] it but I have tasted of the substance of
[1:03:53] it and I know that it's good I can't
[1:03:56] understand how he goes through the
[1:03:57] process I can't understand how a cow
[1:03:59] eats grass all day eats salad all day
[1:04:02] ends up weighing 1100 lb and my wife
[1:04:04] wants me to eat salad all the
[1:04:07] time I can't understand
[1:04:10] it but I know that I've tasted of some
[1:04:14] milk and I have tasted of some honey in
[1:04:16] this book and maybe I don't fully
[1:04:18] understand everything that's laying in
[1:04:20] here but I know if it's for me it's for
[1:04:23] me in my house and if it's for me in my
[1:04:25] house then God will
[1:04:28] bless Hallelujah some things you just
[1:04:32] simply got to take God at his word and
[1:04:35] walk right on out
[1:04:37] there I know what I'm talking about cuz
[1:04:40] I've tasted of it is that right I don't
[1:04:42] want to be one of those naysayers I
[1:04:44] don't want to be one of those people
[1:04:45] that was murmurers and complainers that
[1:04:47] got right up there to the promised land
[1:04:50] and they looked out there and they could
[1:04:51] almost taste The Grapes of that land but
[1:04:54] they didn't go on I want to be somebody
[1:04:56] that maybe I don't understand maybe I
[1:04:58] don't maybe I don't know how I'm going
[1:05:00] to cross the river maybe I don't
[1:05:02] understand how Jericho's going to come
[1:05:03] down maybe I don't understand how I
[1:05:05] could speak to a son and a son would
[1:05:07] stand still but I still want to have the
[1:05:09] faith that if Joshua could do it then I
[1:05:12] can do it maybe I don't understand why
[1:05:15] this one's going this way and that one's
[1:05:17] going that way but God give me the faith
[1:05:19] to stand here like a soldier in the army
[1:05:22] of the Lord
[1:05:25] [Applause]
[1:05:28] Hallelujah brother maram said that when
[1:05:30] a man lives by faith and walks by faith
[1:05:32] I mean substance Faith he has isolated
[1:05:35] from the entire world and becomes a new
[1:05:37] creature in Christ Jesus he said now
[1:05:40] you're getting into bride material see
[1:05:43] you're getting into a rapturing
[1:05:45] condition when you get past Humanity or
[1:05:48] when man gets past the understanding of
[1:05:50] humanity then they're getting into bride
[1:05:54] material I I tell you what I get sick
[1:05:56] and tired of people trying to ask
[1:05:58] explain this to me and explain that to
[1:06:00] me I'm going to tell you there's going
[1:06:01] to have to be some things that God's
[1:06:03] going to have to reveal to you because
[1:06:05] if I can explain it to you then the
[1:06:08] devil can rob it from you but if it's a
[1:06:10] real genuine Revelation from the Throne
[1:06:13] of
[1:06:14] God hallelujah you may not know how to
[1:06:17] write your own name in English but if
[1:06:19] you got a revelation from God on he's
[1:06:21] the kind of God that owns a cattle on a
[1:06:24] thousand hills if you got an
[1:06:26] understanding that he's that kind of a
[1:06:27] God that he healed George EOD and he
[1:06:29] still heals me if you got that kind of
[1:06:32] understanding that he comes and he
[1:06:34] releases people from their bonds and
[1:06:36] their chains then you've got the
[1:06:38] understanding that he can do it right
[1:06:41] here in the midst of the Church of the
[1:06:45] Living God and I I just I I will say
[1:06:48] it's a
[1:06:49] paradox it's a paradox but it's true
[1:06:53] it's incredible but it's true
[1:06:56] ain't nobody ain't nobody since the day
[1:06:59] that that Joshua standing there in
[1:07:00] Joshua 10 stopped the Sun the Bible said
[1:07:03] that nobody's done it since his
[1:07:06] time you imagine what them people on the
[1:07:08] other side of the Earth was thinking
[1:07:11] what have we done
[1:07:13] wrong surely we have sinned the sun has
[1:07:17] not sh they must have been living up
[1:07:18] there in Alaska and the sun ain't shine
[1:07:20] for 24
[1:07:21] hours you imagine but somebody had a
[1:07:24] need
[1:07:26] somebody had a need of a light somebody
[1:07:28] had a need because their enemy was after
[1:07:31] them and they needed a little bit more
[1:07:33] time to chase their enemy down I want to
[1:07:35] say this to you as the Church of the
[1:07:37] Living God there's a man that can turn
[1:07:39] on the
[1:07:40] light maybe you need a little bit more
[1:07:43] time maybe you need a little bit more
[1:07:44] inspiration it's incredible but it's
[1:07:47] true it's true you're not standing here
[1:07:50] under the mind of a man but you're
[1:07:52] standing here under the hour the son of
[1:07:56] man is being revealed you're sitting in
[1:07:58] the same spot that Paul and Peter were
[1:08:00] sitting at that they knew Christ by
[1:08:03] Revelation Paul never knew Jesus In the
[1:08:06] Flesh and if we go a little bit further
[1:08:09] Peter didn't even know Jesus In the
[1:08:12] Flesh well he walked with him brother
[1:08:14] Andrew sure did but he didn't know who
[1:08:16] he was until he got a revelation from
[1:08:18] Heaven saying that thou art the Crist
[1:08:21] the son of the Living God so Paul was in
[1:08:23] the same spot that Peter was in and it
[1:08:26] took Hallelujah it took a paradox to
[1:08:30] show him to knock him off of his high
[1:08:32] horse where he thought he had an
[1:08:35] understanding a I feel like a hillbilly
[1:08:38] preacher
[1:08:39] today but he knocked him off of his high
[1:08:41] horse and he set himself right hey some
[1:08:44] people hallelujah I'm going back to
[1:08:48] preaching but it was a paradox that Paul
[1:08:51] caught the Revelation but he did it's a
[1:08:55] paradox that you caught the revelation
[1:08:58] of what this message said but it
[1:09:00] happened it's here it's in the room it's
[1:09:05] incredible but it's
[1:09:11] true
[1:09:14] hallelujah it's a paradox really it is
[1:09:17] when you begin to
[1:09:19] think you begin to think about any of
[1:09:21] these little boys ain't little no more
[1:09:24] everybody's little from up here standing
[1:09:26] at this spot but but you can imagine can
[1:09:29] you imagine me telling a story about
[1:09:33] Teddy over here going and astonishing
[1:09:36] all the philosophers at
[1:09:38] JMU and emu I believe he could do it I
[1:09:42] just be de honest with you I just be
[1:09:44] real hon I probably didn't choose the
[1:09:46] right
[1:09:47] one probably should have chose me at 12
[1:09:49] years old only thing I was astonishing
[1:09:52] at that moment was my mom that I was
[1:09:54] able to keep white sneakers white at
[1:09:55] that
[1:09:56] time but could you imagine you know what
[1:09:59] I'm talking about a 12-year-old boy
[1:10:01] standing in front of philosophers and
[1:10:03] wise men and theologians standing out
[1:10:05] there and astonishing them by his
[1:10:07] teachings it's it's incredible but it
[1:10:10] was true because you see if you would
[1:10:12] know this boy you would think man that
[1:10:13] guy that guy has really been through
[1:10:15] some schooling or something he but he
[1:10:17] never did get no schooling like the rest
[1:10:19] of them guys had got like the Sadducees
[1:10:21] and the Pharisees had got but he simply
[1:10:23] had a school from above because he was
[1:10:24] the one that wrote the world he was the
[1:10:26] one that spoke the world into existence
[1:10:28] so he was able to give them an
[1:10:31] understanding that they didn't
[1:10:33] have Hallelujah but he was standing
[1:10:35] there and his own his own Earthly mother
[1:10:39] which was the incubator that was a
[1:10:41] carrier of the Jean seed of God when she
[1:10:44] come down there she said Jesus where'
[1:10:47] you been at I know none of y' boys ever
[1:10:50] heard your mama talk like that she said
[1:10:53] me and your father have you for three
[1:10:56] days with tears brother random said that
[1:10:59] she be to deny her own testimony right
[1:11:03] there because she knew that Joseph was
[1:11:06] not Jesus's father come on somebody but
[1:11:09] she be to deny the very testimony the
[1:11:12] very Supernatural testimony that she had
[1:11:15] had you see if Jesus would have been
[1:11:17] Joseph's son he'd have been down there
[1:11:19] building a table or working in a
[1:11:21] carpenter shop but he said I must be
[1:11:23] about my father's business business what
[1:11:26] was his father's business his father's
[1:11:28] business was this word of
[1:11:31] God and that's the same thing that the
[1:11:33] church world has done they've denied the
[1:11:36] supernatural birth the Pentecostals have
[1:11:38] took it by speaking in tongues but they
[1:11:40] denied the birth of the word that's
[1:11:43] exactly what they
[1:11:45] did but Jesus maybe Mary wasn't positive
[1:11:50] about it but Jesus was positive who he
[1:11:52] was I'll say it like this that any man
[1:11:55] or any believer any preacher has got to
[1:11:58] be trained and he's got to be sure and
[1:12:01] has got to be trained to a positive
[1:12:03] sound to a positive
[1:12:07] message somebody's got to know and God
[1:12:10] is always going to have somebody that
[1:12:12] knows who they are they're they're
[1:12:13] positive let me say it like that they're
[1:12:15] positive of their position just like the
[1:12:18] three Hebrew children when they were
[1:12:20] getting ready to be thrown into that
[1:12:22] fiery furnace you they could smell the
[1:12:25] smoke but they was not going to bow down
[1:12:28] to some image that had been made by man
[1:12:31] but God was waiting to watch their
[1:12:34] reaction to this reaction they were
[1:12:37] placed there as sons in the midst of
[1:12:39] Babylon but God was watching them to see
[1:12:43] how that they would react to the issues
[1:12:45] of life as sons of God and he looked out
[1:12:48] upon them and said them's my sons how
[1:12:52] did he know that they was his sons
[1:12:54] because the language
[1:12:55] of the father was in his sons said we
[1:12:58] will not bow to some man-made
[1:13:02] image that's why Sons and Daughters of
[1:13:04] God do not bow down and kiss kiss the
[1:13:08] feet of some statue we don't Bow Down
[1:13:11] and Worship some Mary or some statue
[1:13:15] over I was standing in Belgium I was
[1:13:17] walking through the streets of Brussels
[1:13:19] where the very first two Martyrs in the
[1:13:21] Dark Ages were standing and they gave
[1:13:23] their life for Christianity and right
[1:13:25] around the corner there was a bronze
[1:13:28] statue that people still believe is
[1:13:31] Supernatural and they go in there and
[1:13:33] they lay their hands on that BR that
[1:13:35] bronze on that bronze statue and they
[1:13:37] said they've done had to replace that
[1:13:39] statue so many times because people
[1:13:42] going in there and worshiping a false
[1:13:44] idol because people would go in there
[1:13:46] kiss it off and they kiss off its leg
[1:13:48] and they touch it by the hand and they
[1:13:50] would believe certain
[1:13:52] things I tell you one thing I ain't
[1:13:55] never had to replace my
[1:14:03] God
[1:14:05] hallelujah what did them three Hebrew
[1:14:07] always have they had a language their
[1:14:10] language was not of The Condemned but
[1:14:12] their language was was that of the
[1:14:15] redeemed therefore they had an
[1:14:18] understanding of redemption as being
[1:14:21] from the
[1:14:23] father let me go on just a minute here
[1:14:26] let me just maybe just transition you
[1:14:29] look when you begin to study out in
[1:14:31] Exodus 12 and you begin to look at the
[1:14:34] Exodus that the father would literally
[1:14:39] over his household his household he
[1:14:41] would literally take the authority of
[1:14:45] Moses on what the prophet had said and
[1:14:49] he would simply take what the prophet
[1:14:50] said and he would apply it by faith
[1:14:54] because we recog recognize that in that
[1:14:56] hour that the father was the priest of
[1:15:00] that home now the Bible said here in
[1:15:02] second Corinthians and 6 he said now
[1:15:05] verse 14 he said be ye not unequally
[1:15:07] yolked together with unbelievers for
[1:15:09] what Fellowship ha righteousness with
[1:15:12] unrighteousness and what communion hath
[1:15:14] the light with darkness and what Concord
[1:15:17] hath Christ with b or what part ha he
[1:15:20] that believeth with an Infidel and what
[1:15:22] agreement ha the temple of God with Idol
[1:15:25] for you are a temple of the Living God
[1:15:27] as God have said I will dwell in them
[1:15:30] and I will walk in them and I will be
[1:15:32] their God and they shall be my people
[1:15:35] wherefore come out from amongst them and
[1:15:38] be separate sayith the Lord and touch
[1:15:40] not the uncan thing and I will receive
[1:15:43] you oh my how many wants to be received
[1:15:48] by Jesus and I will receive you and I
[1:15:51] will be a father unto you and you shall
[1:15:54] be my son Sons and Daughters saith the
[1:15:57] Lord Almighty the thing that literally
[1:16:00] separated Israel from Egypt was the
[1:16:04] blood it was the literal thing that
[1:16:07] separated them and made them different
[1:16:10] there were some Egyptians that looked
[1:16:13] apart as the Israelites but the thing
[1:16:16] that made the difference was the blood I
[1:16:20] want to just maybe just build a thought
[1:16:22] right here on the father that notic that
[1:16:25] when Paul is laying out this letter here
[1:16:27] to the Corinthians and he says I will be
[1:16:30] a father unto you and that you shall be
[1:16:32] my sons saith the Lord Almighty I just
[1:16:35] want to reflect right here on this
[1:16:37] moment real quick that you are the
[1:16:40] children of the Living God and you have
[1:16:43] the maker of heaven and Earth as your
[1:16:46] father and as your
[1:16:49] friend as Jeremiah would say in Jeremiah
[1:16:51] 31 at the same time sayith the Lord will
[1:16:54] I the God of all the families of Israel
[1:16:57] and they shall be my people Revelations
[1:17:00] 21-7 says he that overcometh shall
[1:17:04] inherit all things and I will be his
[1:17:07] God and he shall be my
[1:17:13] son there's one thing that I
[1:17:15] enjoy I enjoy I enjoy being a father to
[1:17:20] two little
[1:17:21] girls but I can't imagine what what it
[1:17:24] is for God
[1:17:25] God for us to for him to watch us as
[1:17:29] Sons and Daughters of god notice when
[1:17:32] Paul is writing this out that Paul uses
[1:17:36] this word in the Greek
[1:17:37] pantor and it's only used in here in the
[1:17:41] letter of Corinthians and only used when
[1:17:44] John when John is the was is is the
[1:17:47] Scribe for the Book of Revelations it's
[1:17:49] only used here and that word pantor it
[1:17:53] signifies that God is all ruling he is
[1:17:56] absolute and he and and he is is
[1:17:59] absolute he is Sovereign and he is the
[1:18:02] almighty and he is the omnipotent one it
[1:18:06] literally means he who has all
[1:18:10] power and it is applied to God in
[1:18:12] contrast from Idols that are Weak and
[1:18:17] Powerless so there is nobody that can
[1:18:21] have this title of the almighty the
[1:18:24] omnipotent in one the one that holds all
[1:18:26] power in heaven and in Earth only this
[1:18:30] title can go to almighty God come on
[1:18:34] somebody some man cannot have that title
[1:18:37] some Bishop cannot have that title some
[1:18:40] preacher cannot have that title but
[1:18:43] almighty God that spoke the worlds into
[1:18:46] existence he roded them off of his
[1:18:48] fingertips and he allowed them go out
[1:18:50] there for millions of years and it would
[1:18:52] stop it in its existence this Almighty
[1:18:55] one Paul is saying he is your
[1:19:01] father
[1:19:04] hallelujah what is your situation to the
[1:19:07] almighty God what is your problem what
[1:19:10] is your situation what is your
[1:19:13] sickness your situation is not greater
[1:19:17] than your
[1:19:19] predestination Hallelujah this Almighty
[1:19:22] one is all powerful it reminds me that
[1:19:26] when when the prophet is over there in
[1:19:27] India and he's there and he's going to
[1:19:29] the meeting and there's a man he sees
[1:19:31] this man and he's carrying this Idol in
[1:19:33] his hands he's carrying this idle in his
[1:19:35] hand he's walking down through there and
[1:19:37] brother Bam gets out of the car and goes
[1:19:38] down there and starts talking to him he
[1:19:40] said now why do you carry that he said
[1:19:42] well my father carried this Idol he said
[1:19:44] and my father he said one day he was he
[1:19:46] was out there and a lion came out upon
[1:19:48] him and he stuck this he he stuck this
[1:19:51] he stuck this Idol out in front of that
[1:19:52] line and and he built a fire and the
[1:19:55] lion ran away the prophet said look he
[1:19:57] said it wasn't he said it wasn't that
[1:19:59] little Idol he said it was that fire
[1:20:01] because a lion scared the fire he said
[1:20:03] if you'll see Jesus Christ as a living
[1:20:06] resurrected savior will you throw down
[1:20:08] your
[1:20:08] idol he said well we carry this just in
[1:20:11] case amoya doesn't show
[1:20:14] up you see he was packing something that
[1:20:17] his daddy had had for years and years
[1:20:21] and years and how many times do people
[1:20:24] St up and they carry things in their
[1:20:27] past they carry things from their from
[1:20:29] their past of things that they that
[1:20:31] their daddy dealt with that they Mama
[1:20:33] dealt with I'd say it's time that you
[1:20:35] trade your misinformation for
[1:20:39] Revelation I'd say it's time that you
[1:20:41] throw down your Idols throw down your
[1:20:43] Traditions throw down what you think God
[1:20:46] is what you think you've got to deal
[1:20:48] with the rest of your life I don't even
[1:20:50] care if it's religion if it's a complex
[1:20:53] throw that thing down if it's a stigma
[1:20:56] throw that thing down come on somebody
[1:20:59] if it's sickness if it's torment if it's
[1:21:02] Earthly diseases or if it's a spiritual
[1:21:09] warfare I love when brother randam is
[1:21:11] standing there he starts taking us
[1:21:13] through India the Indian report and he
[1:21:15] goes through there and and I I'll be
[1:21:17] honest I love studying those things out
[1:21:19] and you start hearing about those things
[1:21:20] that that the Lord did right there and
[1:21:22] he people that were crosy people that
[1:21:24] were people that were paralyzed people
[1:21:26] that were bound to Wheelchairs and
[1:21:27] people that you remember the story about
[1:21:28] the man that was led like a dog by a
[1:21:30] chain of fair and there when brother
[1:21:32] bandam had that Vision it was time for a
[1:21:35] showdown much like a much like a
[1:21:38] showdown of two two backsliding
[1:21:40] preachers that were going to try to
[1:21:42] expose this message for being wrong is
[1:21:44] that right it was a showdown just like
[1:21:46] that and there the Lord showed up he
[1:21:50] said now if God will heal this boy I
[1:21:53] ain't got time to go through the whole
[1:21:54] thing but if God will heal this boy will
[1:21:56] you throw down your idols and serve the
[1:21:59] Living God William brandom said it was
[1:22:02] like the greatest dust storm that you
[1:22:04] ever did see when men threw down their
[1:22:07] Idols I'd say let's cause a dust storm
[1:22:10] of creating throwing down our doubt
[1:22:13] throwing down our fear
[1:22:17] throwing you're not an
[1:22:20] unbeliever you're not an unbeliever
[1:22:23] you're not a skep
[1:22:25] you forgive me I'm going to lay right
[1:22:27] here you're not a disbeliever you've not
[1:22:30] misinterpreted the word of God you're
[1:22:32] not a skeptic you're not a Critic you
[1:22:34] would have never got in the building
[1:22:36] that
[1:22:37] way that's just a devil lying to you
[1:22:40] trying to make you think you are a
[1:22:42] skeptic make you think you're that kind
[1:22:44] of
[1:22:49] thought throw that thing
[1:22:51] down Hallelujah
[1:22:56] and he will be a father unto
[1:23:00] you the prophet said in Christ of
[1:23:02] mystery he said but what he wanted to do
[1:23:06] he loved fatherhood for he was a
[1:23:10] father and the only way that he could
[1:23:13] express it was to become a son of
[1:23:16] man so when Adam falls in the Garden of
[1:23:22] Eden he walks out with his eyes wide
[1:23:24] open because of his wife showing a type
[1:23:28] of
[1:23:29] Christ what did the father do he
[1:23:31] provided a way back for fellowship with
[1:23:35] the father
[1:23:37] again that even when you have went
[1:23:42] past the promises God provides a way for
[1:23:46] you maybe I'm crazy but I just happen to
[1:23:50] be one of them guys that believe as long
[1:23:52] as you got air in your lungs
[1:23:55] that I'll never give up hope on
[1:23:58] you maybe I'm crazy but I believe that
[1:24:01] that that that no man is past the point
[1:24:05] if God still got his eye on him I
[1:24:08] believe that you can get into such a
[1:24:10] spot that God will literally deal with
[1:24:12] you and I believe that almighty God can
[1:24:15] search for you search for you and find
[1:24:19] you because you didn't find
[1:24:22] him he found you
[1:24:25] and if he found you surely he can find
[1:24:30] them it might beyond your understanding
[1:24:33] but he that kind of a God now notice
[1:24:36] what the Bible said in Exodus 12: 13 I
[1:24:38] got to hurry and the blood shall be unto
[1:24:40] you for a token upon the houses where
[1:24:43] you are and when I see the blood I will
[1:24:46] pass over you and the plague shall not
[1:24:48] be upon you to destroy you when I smite
[1:24:50] the land so we recognize that God
[1:24:53] required a
[1:24:55] token and when the token was on the door
[1:24:58] it was a sign whether it was whether it
[1:25:00] was Rahab or whether it was the
[1:25:02] Israelites it was a sign that the fair
[1:25:05] had been
[1:25:07] paid look at your neighbor and said I've
[1:25:10] got the
[1:25:12] token the token is none other than the
[1:25:15] life of Jesus
[1:25:17] Christ now you know good and well if
[1:25:19] you're going to ride on a train you got
[1:25:21] to have a ticket in your hand it's your
[1:25:23] token
[1:25:25] ain't nobody on that train going to
[1:25:27] stand there and tell you you're going to
[1:25:28] have to go surround some curves
[1:25:30] sometimes you're going to have to go
[1:25:31] around some tunnels sometimes you going
[1:25:33] to go through some dark
[1:25:35] spots let me let me put it in my terms
[1:25:38] the journey ahead of you on this train
[1:25:40] it might be dark and it might be lonely
[1:25:43] and it might be bumpy but I want you to
[1:25:45] tell I want to tell you it's paid
[1:25:49] for it's paid
[1:25:52] for you might feel like you're lost you
[1:25:55] might maybe you might feel like you're
[1:25:57] forsaken you might feel like you're all
[1:25:59] alone but I want you to know and remind
[1:26:02] you you're not alone in this battle stop
[1:26:05] trying to fight your battles all alone
[1:26:07] but he's the kind of God that said that
[1:26:09] I will be before you and I will be
[1:26:11] behind you I'll be your head and I'll be
[1:26:14] I'll be your defense I'll be your
[1:26:18] buckler let God fight your battles now
[1:26:22] notice when there they were
[1:26:24] they were applying the blood to the door
[1:26:28] it didn't tell them to apply it on the
[1:26:30] floor but apply it on the Lyal of the
[1:26:33] door so that everybody can see
[1:26:36] it pled over there and the rest of the
[1:26:39] world thought it was foolishness but it
[1:26:41] was the only way that they were going to
[1:26:44] escape death but what a time and what a
[1:26:47] privilege that we're living in that we
[1:26:49] have the opportunity to to to possess
[1:26:54] and to pack the very token life of Jesus
[1:26:57] Christ I say it like the prophet said
[1:27:00] it's a positive token they no make
[1:27:03] belief about this token everybody knew
[1:27:05] that the lamb had been slain when you
[1:27:08] had the blood upon your door your
[1:27:09] neighbor saw it your best friend saw it
[1:27:12] your enemies saw it everybody saw that
[1:27:15] the token was there what was it a sign
[1:27:18] of that a lamb had died so that you
[1:27:21] could go
[1:27:22] free and that's a same way with the
[1:27:25] message of the hour that there has been
[1:27:27] a token life of Jesus Christ that has
[1:27:30] been released in this hour that the Holy
[1:27:33] Ghost is a positive token that a lamb
[1:27:36] died for you and you receed that
[1:27:39] token and when you got the Holy Ghost as
[1:27:42] the token life of Jesus Christ there is
[1:27:44] no make belief there is no put on there
[1:27:47] is no impersonation it is there you know
[1:27:50] it the devil knows it the world knows it
[1:27:54] because the
[1:27:56] token is
[1:28:03] there I can tell you what I what I
[1:28:05] remember as a son I remember feeling him
[1:28:09] pulling on me brother Joel I could I
[1:28:11] could literally I could literally go
[1:28:12] back to the moments in my life and
[1:28:14] literally feel him pulling on my
[1:28:16] heartstrings and still understanding
[1:28:19] that I was
[1:28:21] lost in my terminology I was lost lost I
[1:28:25] was saved 2,000 years ago but I
[1:28:28] literally knew that if he came for me in
[1:28:31] those hours that I wouldn't be in where
[1:28:33] in the shape that I needed to be in but
[1:28:35] I can literally go back to the moments
[1:28:37] in my life point back to the moments
[1:28:39] when he was literally drawing me
[1:28:42] literally drawing me by the power of His
[1:28:45] presence he was drawing me you know that
[1:28:49] that that as a child you you get worried

[1:29:06] about you get nervous but you know the
[1:29:08] power of the inspiration when you don't

[1:30:10] carnality I'm free from spiritual
[1:30:13] bondage I'm free from
[1:30:19] it the prophet said in Israel and the
[1:30:22] church in 1953 he said he said you could
[1:30:25] literally the hounds or the the Wolves
[1:30:28] could come howling at the window and you
[1:30:31] knew you were
[1:30:32] safe you could hear the screams of Egypt
[1:30:36] and you knew you were
[1:30:37] safe the prophet said he said I can see
[1:30:40] them Egyptian girls them Egyptian girls
[1:30:43] going down there walking up to the
[1:30:46] window and say Martha aren't you coming
[1:30:48] down to the dance tonight and she speaks
[1:30:51] back and says no I don't have no desire
[1:30:53] to go back to the prom no more I don't
[1:30:56] have no desire to go back there because
[1:30:58] I know as long as long as I'm on the
[1:31:01] inside of this
[1:31:04] token I'm safe I don't have the desire
[1:31:07] of Egypt I don't have the desire of leot
[1:31:10] to see you let me put it in my own
[1:31:12] hillbilly Kentucky and hillbilly
[1:31:14] Virginia excuse me hillbilly Virginia
[1:31:17] ways why do I need to go down to the
[1:31:19] proma dance when I can dance behind this
[1:31:21] token
[1:31:23] [Applause]
[1:31:35] I I'm I'm being I'm being honest why do
[1:31:38] why do I need to go
[1:31:40] down brother Homer would say why do I
[1:31:43] need to go down there to Good Time
[1:31:46] Charlie why do do why do I need to go
[1:31:49] down there and enjoy just an enticement
[1:31:51] for a little bit of time when I can
[1:31:53] stand up here
[1:31:54] and dance for the Lord I know that I'm
[1:31:57] safe in doing
[1:32:00] it hallelujah how much more does he give
[1:32:04] you a liberty to know that you're not
[1:32:08] going to die with the rest of the
[1:32:16] Egyptians I'm going to read this to
[1:32:19] you because I believe that there's one
[1:32:23] thing that has been Tak taken away from
[1:32:25] our society that fatherhood has been
[1:32:28] broken fatherhood has been broken and
[1:32:31] that has been stolen away from people
[1:32:34] where daddies don't know how to be
[1:32:36] daddies no
[1:32:37] more look at the statistics of men and
[1:32:42] look at the statistics of children that
[1:32:44] grew up in a home that had a father
[1:32:46] figure there and watch where they are
[1:32:50] just go study out the statistics of how
[1:32:52] they got in inv involved in drugs and
[1:32:54] now they got involved in jail and did it
[1:32:56] doesn't matter what color race they are
[1:32:58] find out if they had a father figure
[1:33:01] there and find out where the source came
[1:33:05] from what's up brother Andrew I didn't
[1:33:07] have a father in my life you do
[1:33:11] now I had a father that beat me brother
[1:33:13] Andrew you ain't got a father like that
[1:33:16] now you got a father that'll never beat
[1:33:20] you you got a father that'll never whip
[1:33:22] you you got a father that'll never leave
[1:33:25] you you got a father that'll never
[1:33:26] forsake you you got a father that is not
[1:33:28] an abusive
[1:33:31] God come on somebody you got the kind of
[1:33:34] father that won't take you out and
[1:33:36] string you out on drugs but this father
[1:33:39] will take you to the healing veins of
[1:33:44] Jesus he said the father was the priest
[1:33:46] of the house in the old sanctuary in the
[1:33:48] old time he said the father was the
[1:33:50] priest he had to watch over his
[1:33:52] household
[1:33:54] what a change today the kids watch over
[1:33:57] the dad in the modern
[1:34:03] world but the father was to watch over
[1:34:07] his house he killed the lamb he took the
[1:34:11] hiss up and put it on the doors on the
[1:34:13] lentil and that was their protection all
[1:34:16] right they stayed in he said I can see
[1:34:18] the rest of them frolicking and carrying
[1:34:20] on saying look at that bunch of Fanatics
[1:34:22] oh with an old sheep Blood on the door
[1:34:25] trying to make some say this Hocus Pocus
[1:34:27] something's going to happen but it did
[1:34:30] why because God said so it was the truth
[1:34:33] When God says so and there they are
[1:34:37] under that blood they had no desire to
[1:34:40] go
[1:34:42] out as brother Joe Green says that I
[1:34:45] drink all I want to I smoke all I want
[1:34:51] to now y'all know good and well y'all
[1:34:53] know brother Joe Green's quote he said
[1:34:54] because the want to has been taken away
[1:34:56] from
[1:34:57] me you see they had no more desire to go
[1:35:00] out there you say desire that's right
[1:35:03] for there is therefore now no
[1:35:05] condemnation to them that's come in at
[1:35:08] the
[1:35:09] door to think that the son knew he had
[1:35:13] an understanding that behind that blood
[1:35:17] behind that blood was his safety zone
[1:35:21] now notice this lamb was to be supposed
[1:35:23] to be kept up for 14 days of the month
[1:35:26] for there and notice and verse six and
[1:35:29] you shall keep it up under the 14 day of
[1:35:31] the same month and the whole assembly of
[1:35:34] the congregation of Israel shall kill it
[1:35:36] in the
[1:35:38] evening the whole assembly so it wasn't
[1:35:42] just laid on the pope it wasn't just
[1:35:45] laid on the preachers but it was laid on
[1:35:47] the whole
[1:35:49] congregation and the lamb was kept up
[1:35:52] for 14 days let me put it like this the
[1:35:56] lamb was kept up in the dark ages the
[1:35:58] lamp was kept up the lamb was kept up in
[1:36:01] Luther's day the lamb was kept up in
[1:36:03] Wesley's day the lamb was kept up in in
[1:36:07] Pentecost but now we recognize that the
[1:36:10] token life of Jesus Christ is here the
[1:36:14] lamb the very life of the Lamb has
[1:36:17] returned back to the
[1:36:20] believer oh was it they were eat this
[1:36:24] lamb they were to eat this lamb they
[1:36:27] were to burn it with fire they're not
[1:36:29] just supposed to take half the book they
[1:36:32] were supposed to take the whole book
[1:36:34] they were supposed to take the legs they
[1:36:35] were supposed to take the head and they
[1:36:37] were supposed to take it in there and
[1:36:39] they were supposed to roast it with fire
[1:36:41] and the Bible said don't eat it
[1:36:43] raw don't eat it
[1:36:47] Soden it says don't eat it raw don't eat
[1:36:50] it Soden it all with water but roast it
[1:36:53] with fire
[1:36:54] now I know I know that you know these
[1:36:56] things but you know you see notice
[1:36:59] there's powerful things when you study
[1:37:01] these things out don't eat it raw don't
[1:37:04] eat it half don't eat it halfway cooked
[1:37:07] the reason why is because the Egyptians
[1:37:11] when they would go to worship their gods
[1:37:14] they would worship they would worship
[1:37:17] and they would eat meat and it would be
[1:37:19] raw or
[1:37:21] half or half or half cooked so God is
[1:37:26] saying unto them that these Egyptians
[1:37:29] these Egyptians that worship almost the
[1:37:31] same way it looks the same way that your
[1:37:34] worship cannot look like the Egyptians
[1:37:37] you've got to burn it with fire that
[1:37:40] that you've got to literally burn out
[1:37:42] the life of that lamb you've got to burn
[1:37:45] out the life of that lamb until all of
[1:37:48] it is completely roasted with
[1:37:51] fire but the problem of it is is too
[1:37:54] many times people don't have enough fire
[1:37:57] in their experience they don't have
[1:37:59] enough fire in their experience to get
[1:38:01] this lamb word good and hot get it good
[1:38:05] and hot if you get this lamb word good
[1:38:07] and hot it'll burn out sin it'll burn
[1:38:10] out your problems it'll burn out your
[1:38:12] game boys it'll burn out your
[1:38:14] PlayStations it'll burn out your
[1:38:18] habits don't water it
[1:38:20] down don't water it down don't bull it
[1:38:23] don't boil this lamb don't water it down
[1:38:26] when you water down wine what do you do
[1:38:28] you're taken away from the effect and
[1:38:30] when you water down this lamb message
[1:38:32] you're taking away from the power of the
[1:38:34] Lamb's message but eat the whole lamb
[1:38:38] don't you delute don't you dilute this
[1:38:40] message by your own mundane experiences
[1:38:43] don't you do it don't water it down but
[1:38:47] eat the whole lamb eat the head eat the
[1:38:50] foots eat the intestines eat all of it
[1:38:56] I know it's going to cause some problems
[1:38:58] when you start eating this when you
[1:39:01] start eating all of
[1:39:02] this your friends are going to look at
[1:39:04] you
[1:39:06] differently your problems are going to
[1:39:08] look at you differently your situations
[1:39:10] are going to look at you differently why
[1:39:12] because you're eating the
[1:39:14] lamb it look crazy to the rest of the
[1:39:17] world but they was up there and the rest
[1:39:20] of the world was mocking them and making
[1:39:22] fun but when the Midnight Hour came and
[1:39:25] the Death Angel come whirling down
[1:39:26] through those streets it may have looked
[1:39:28] crazy to them but the blood was on the
[1:39:31] door the Lamb's life had been slain and
[1:39:35] it didn't make sense but their problems
[1:39:38] knew that they couldn't touch them no
[1:39:42] more oh Hallelujah that's why the
[1:39:45] prophet would say show the devil your
[1:39:49] token take your token and it over your
[1:39:54] household and show the
[1:39:58] devil what' you show up at church for
[1:40:00] today brother Andrew I showed up to show
[1:40:02] the devil whose side I'm

[1:40:17] here men have ridiculed you men have
[1:40:20] made fun of you men said you never made
[1:40:23] make it but the lamb said you're worth
[1:40:27] dying
[1:40:28] for you could go free from
[1:40:31] [Applause]
[1:40:38] it
[1:40:42] Hallelujah I'm I'm just I'm I'm I'm
[1:40:49] coming I'm going to close with this
[1:40:51] scripture go ahead and stand with with
