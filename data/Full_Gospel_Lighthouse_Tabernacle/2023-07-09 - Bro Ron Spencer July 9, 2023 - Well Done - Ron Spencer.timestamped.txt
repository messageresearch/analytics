[52:13] you'll remember that's what brother
[52:14] Branham said to first man I want to
[52:16] shake his hand is Uriah

[52:22] it and so amen God bless you thank you
[52:25] for that have a couple of requests I
[52:27] want to just continue to remember
[52:29] brother Doug and his family that is
[52:31] fighting a bug and he lost his father
[52:34] while we were away we were able to pray
[52:36] with him just before actually the day
[52:39] before he passed away and just pray that
[52:41] God would touch them in a special way
[52:43] and brother Randy's been in the hospital
[52:45] with pneumonia and brother Donnie is
[52:49] just needing a real touch from God
[52:52] amen amen and soul remember them in
[52:55] prayer brother Mike walls brought us a
[52:57] request yesterday
[52:59] they've been in a building a seven day
[53:01] Adventist and I asked him if I could
[53:03] bring it to you I believe we have power
[53:06] here then we bind our prayers together
[53:09] brother Mike walls is a dear friend a
[53:11] sister Church of ours a church of about
[53:13] 300 people
[53:15] at the seventh day of Venice they've
[53:17] been there for 26 years
[53:20] and paying phenomenal rent there but
[53:23] that church got a new pastor
[53:25] and he doesn't like what we preach and
[53:27] so
[53:28] and so they have Eva they have told them
[53:31] to leave
[53:32] and you know finding a new church in 30
[53:36] days is really difficult to do
[53:40] but we believe God can help them and so
[53:42] and so I would just it's caused a cause
[53:45] a lot of nervousness and tension there
[53:47] and so you would remember them that God
[53:49] would just be with them in a in a
[53:51] special way and and help them to find a
[53:55] place I'd be kind of like us having to
[53:57] find a place in 30 days and look around
[54:01] kind of difficult to do and so amen so
[54:05] if you remember them in prayer that God
[54:07] would just be with them in a special way
[54:09] and amen we want to greet everybody here

[54:30] incredible things and so we're back home

[54:35] want to speak to you this morning
[54:37] started anyway
[54:39] on well done

[54:45] we'll turn to Proverbs chapter 31 10.
[54:49] and um amen we'll read the first
[54:52] scripture and then we'll let you be
[54:53] seated
[54:55] and the Lord said unto him
[54:57] well done thou good and faithful servant
[55:01] incredible words to hear from God
[55:04] well done thou good and faithful servant

[55:15] enter thou into the joy
[55:18] of the Lord you may be seated Hallelujah
[55:27] Proverbs chapter 31 and verse 10.
[55:31] I want to read not just about our
[55:33] sisters but to the Bride of Jesus Christ
[55:37] a much bigger picture
[55:39] and we're at the very closing of
[55:42] the Gentile dispensation
[55:45] I want to say some things along that
[55:47] line before we get too too far
[55:50] who can find a virtuous woman
[55:54] for her price is far
[55:56] above rubies
[55:58] the heart of her husband
[56:00] thus safely trust in her
[56:03] so that he hath no need
[56:06] of spoil
[56:07] she will do him good and not evil all
[56:10] the days of her life
[56:12] she seeketh wool and flax and worketh
[56:15] willingly with her hands
[56:17] she is like a merchant ship
[56:20] she bringeth
[56:21] her food from afar she arises while it
[56:26] is yet night
[56:28] and giveth meat to her household and a
[56:31] portion to her maidens
[56:32] she considereth a field and buyeth it
[56:35] with the fruit of her hands she plant at
[56:37] the vineyard she girdeth with loins with
[56:41] strength and strengthen her arms
[56:44] she's perceiveth that her merchandise is
[56:47] good and her candle goeth not out by
[56:50] night she layeth her hands to the
[56:53] spindle in her hands hold the distaff
[56:55] she strengtheneth she stretches out her
[56:59] hand to the poor yea she reaches forth
[57:02] as her hands to the needy she is not
[57:05] afraid of the snow for her household
[57:09] for all her household are clothed with
[57:13] Scarlet she maketh her self-coverance of
[57:16] tapestry and her clothing is is silk and
[57:19] purple
[57:20] her husband is known in the gates when
[57:22] he sitteth among the Elders of the land
[57:26] she maketh find linen and selleth it and
[57:28] delivereth girdles
[57:30] unto the merchants
[57:32] stretcheth
[57:34] strength and honor are her clothing and
[57:37] she she
[57:39] rejoice in time to come
[57:42] she opened her mouth with wisdom and her
[57:45] tongue is the law of kindness she
[57:48] looketh well to the ways of her
[57:50] household when the Edith not of the
[57:52] bread of idleness
[57:53] her children arise up and call her
[57:56] blessed her husband also and he prayeth
[57:59] her many daughters have done virtuously
[58:02] but thou excellus them all
[58:05] favor and deceit is beauty is vain but a
[58:09] woman that feareth the Lord she shall be
[58:12] praised give her the fruit of her hands
[58:16] and let her own
[58:18] works praise her in the gates
[58:25] that's what God says about this precious
[58:27] woman
[58:29] brother Branham says an invisible Union
[58:31] to the bride which is one of the most
[58:34] Cornerstone messages of the hour
[58:37] he said what a glorious opportunity that
[58:40] we have to speak to a dying people
[58:42] it's a great time we're enthused about
[58:45] it we know that history is closing out
[58:49] the world's history will soon be over
[58:52] and then we're going to step into a new
[58:55] day to that great millennium
[58:58] as a one believer I believe in the
[59:00] Millennium a millennium reign with
[59:02] Christ A Thousand Years upon the Earth
[59:05] the physical return of our Lord Jesus to
[59:10] take a physical people
[59:12] glorified
[59:13] by his cleansing blood
[59:16] what an incredible statement
[59:20] he said Christ was the Living Word he's
[59:23] always what's the word he is still the
[59:26] word he always will be the word
[59:29] he was only the manifestation of the
[59:33] attributes of God for he was the son of
[59:36] God
[59:37] and any son is the attributes of his
[59:40] father and just as you were in the genes
[59:43] of your father in the body of your
[59:46] father when he was a young man you were
[59:49] in him yet he could not have fellowship
[59:52] with you
[59:54] because he didn't know you but then
[59:57] through the betting grounds of a mother
[1:00:00] Ada
[1:00:02] Judah
[1:00:03] Uriah
[1:00:06] but then through the betting grounds of
[1:00:08] your mother you were brought forth into
[1:00:10] the Earth
[1:00:11] and become the image of your father
[1:00:14] then he could fellowship with you
[1:00:17] and so so were you the sons of God and
[1:00:21] Daughters of God
[1:00:23] before there was ever a moon
[1:00:26] stars or a molecule
[1:00:29] you were Sons and Daughters of God
[1:00:34] for you are the only the physical
[1:00:37] manifestation of the attributes that was
[1:00:41] in God at the beginning Luther couldn't
[1:00:45] say this
[1:00:47] Wesley couldn't say this
[1:00:51] but your messenger
[1:00:54] speaking to the final voice to the final
[1:00:57] age
[1:00:58] could tell you that you were the you are
[1:01:01] the physical
[1:01:02] attributes of God that God thought of
[1:01:06] before the foundation of the world
[1:01:12] that puts you in a special place
[1:01:16] now you don't know nothing about that
[1:01:19] neither did you know when you were was
[1:01:21] in your Earthly father but you are
[1:01:24] manifested into his image
[1:01:28] and then the image of God you are made
[1:01:30] and you're manifested for the glory and
[1:01:34] The Fellowship Of God and therefore as
[1:01:37] sure as your Gene had to be in your
[1:01:41] father before the natural father your
[1:01:44] spiritual Gene had to be in God
[1:01:49] because you're an expression of the
[1:01:51] attributes of his thoughts before the
[1:01:54] foundation of the world no way around it
[1:01:58] brother Brandon was not talking about a
[1:02:00] Physical Realm now he's talking about an
[1:02:03] eternal Realm
[1:02:05] now there's no way around it he says now
[1:02:07] we notice then that the life being in
[1:02:11] you God's life being in you
[1:02:15] from the foundation of the world
[1:02:20] how many wars how many plagues
[1:02:23] how many earthquakes how many natural
[1:02:25] disasters
[1:02:28] you're not here by an accident
[1:02:32] there might have been a lot of turmoil
[1:02:34] that has went through your life
[1:02:37] but you're not even in control of your
[1:02:39] own being
[1:02:43] quite a statement you made last night
[1:02:45] you're not even in control of your own
[1:02:47] even your own destiny
[1:02:51] we make decisions we make choices we we
[1:02:55] think we're in control
[1:02:57] but let me just say in this little realm
[1:03:00] of life
[1:03:03] if you live to be a hundred years old
[1:03:06] in this little realm of life we make
[1:03:10] decisions that take us one way or
[1:03:12] another but the greatest decision we can
[1:03:15] make is that Eternal one
[1:03:18] gain the whole world lose your soul
[1:03:26] brother Ben will use this term he said
[1:03:29] God's like a great contractor
[1:03:32] when he was making the Earth he said
[1:03:36] he said he laid the the potash and the
[1:03:39] calcium and all the materials that would
[1:03:42] build your body
[1:03:44] he knew where you would be birthed that
[1:03:47] he knew he knew everything about you he
[1:03:49] he took a picture of you before the
[1:03:51] foundation of the world he said it's
[1:03:53] like a contract to the layout two
[1:03:55] befores and he'll he'll lay out the the
[1:03:58] materials for the house to be built he's
[1:04:01] got an idea because he's got a blueprint
[1:04:04] and then that blueprint he begins to
[1:04:07] work and the ground begins to be
[1:04:09] prepared and then the foundation is laid
[1:04:11] and then then as it begins to build and
[1:04:14] then then inspectors come to check to
[1:04:16] make sure it's okay and then it's just
[1:04:18] built there's a lot of things that go
[1:04:20] into it different ones will come to work
[1:04:23] on that
[1:04:26] and then you know you'll stand back and
[1:04:28] there will be a there will be a time to
[1:04:30] where you can say it's done
[1:04:33] and you know what a great thing it is
[1:04:35] because you get under such anticipation
[1:04:37] especially after the sheetrock is put up
[1:04:41] you think we're just so close you're
[1:04:43] really about halfway
[1:04:45] foreign
[1:04:46] am I talking to you you're really about
[1:04:49] halfway and then then there's a lot of
[1:04:51] things that got to take place and then
[1:04:53] the painting is done and all the trim is
[1:04:55] done the cabinets are placed the
[1:04:57] plumbing is finished and every all the
[1:04:59] electricity is done and and that and all
[1:05:02] the Heating units are just in the right
[1:05:04] place and and the carpet is laid and the
[1:05:06] wood is laid and you know and then you
[1:05:09] begin to think about you know the
[1:05:12] finishing touches
[1:05:14] then you go back and you look at the
[1:05:16] little dings and the knocks and the
[1:05:18] little paintings and the change things
[1:05:19] that you want to change and everything
[1:05:21] that is just right let me just say God's
[1:05:24] been watching over this project
[1:05:29] he's been watching over this project a
[1:05:32] long time
[1:05:33] and there's nothing out of cater
[1:05:38] when a prophet is standing there and I
[1:05:41] think about when he's speaking the
[1:05:43] spoken word is the original C
[1:05:47] look back no other no other philosopher
[1:05:49] no other Theologian ever preached
[1:05:52] sermons like that
[1:05:56] you came out of all different kind of
[1:05:58] denominations and had all kind of
[1:06:00] flavors but never a man
[1:06:03] was given the opportunity to speak the
[1:06:06] words of eternal life
[1:06:09] sure there was a lot of people sitting
[1:06:11] in those audience that just
[1:06:13] passed it off and just went on about
[1:06:16] their business maybe you were invited to
[1:06:19] a meeting and and you and somebody
[1:06:21] invited you to service and they walked
[1:06:24] away but your invitation you came and
[1:06:27] heard the word
[1:06:30] are you with me it's like I met a man
[1:06:34] from Singapore and and they were he was
[1:06:37] in the military and he was invited to to
[1:06:39] to go to a meeting and deep call it to
[1:06:42] the deep and and he was invited to go to
[1:06:44] the meeting and watch this the prophet
[1:06:47] that was there and that man that invited
[1:06:50] him he went and didn't say he said well
[1:06:53] ain't nothing there for me and the guy
[1:06:56] that was invited said that's a prophet
[1:07:02] that's a prophet let me just say this to
[1:07:05] you for the seed of God
[1:07:07] you know when you look at it you go well
[1:07:09] it may not be good for you but it is for
[1:07:11] me
[1:07:14] it's eternal life now now let me just
[1:07:17] say this to you there's a lot of times
[1:07:18] that people come along and struggle with
[1:07:20] it for years and then all of a sudden
[1:07:22] the light comes on
[1:07:26] are you with me maybe you've battled and
[1:07:28] you've had a lot of questions and you
[1:07:30] wrestle it with it you wrestle in its
[1:07:32] own mind
[1:07:34] you know I always think about this we in
[1:07:38] our feeble
[1:07:39] I'm 61. we in our 61 years of
[1:07:43] experiences
[1:07:45] think that we can wrestle with the mind
[1:07:47] of God
[1:07:50] really
[1:07:52] really
[1:07:55] we're so green behind our ears we don't
[1:07:57] even know
[1:07:59] if it wasn't God's grace and mercy
[1:08:05] oh brother I want to argue with brother
[1:08:07] Branham let me just say it's too late
[1:08:11] I I want to argue with the message it's
[1:08:14] too late
[1:08:16] and by the way there's not another
[1:08:17] messenger coming it's too late
[1:08:20] there's not an if this message didn't
[1:08:22] catch you or it's too late
[1:08:25] you prepare for the tribulation period
[1:08:31] if this message doesn't get you ready
[1:08:33] for a Rapture you need to be doing some
[1:08:36] preparation
[1:08:38] for Americans you need to be getting
[1:08:40] ready for bombs to drop
[1:08:48] this week was enough to tell you that
[1:08:52] we're so close to the coming of the Lord
[1:08:56] we're so close
[1:08:58] I don't have time to go into it but
[1:09:00] we're so close
[1:09:02] your your senators and your
[1:09:04] representatives are calling for for the
[1:09:07] Ukraine to become a NATO Nation that's
[1:09:11] the very reason there's a war
[1:09:15] and
[1:09:16] now it looks like Russia is going to be
[1:09:20] Point Blank against the United States of
[1:09:23] America we've been knowing that for 58
[1:09:26] years
[1:09:29] we had tomorrow's newspaper given to us
[1:09:35] so this is no place to stay
[1:09:38] [Music]
[1:09:41] brother Brandon stood and it may have
[1:09:43] been a difficult thing for those
[1:09:44] denominations to hear Full Gospel
[1:09:47] businessmen almost every denomination
[1:09:50] especially in our area every
[1:09:52] denomination came to those meetings and
[1:09:55] sat there and listened it may have been
[1:09:57] difficult for them to hear but we've
[1:10:00] come to the end
[1:10:02] God showed us his signs he stood there
[1:10:05] and spoken word and then he stood there
[1:10:07] in the seals and revealed the book
[1:10:11] every mystery was revealed and then he
[1:10:14] began to tell you you're not a church
[1:10:17] [Applause]
[1:10:20] you're the Bride of Jesus Christ and
[1:10:23] your bone of his born in your life of
[1:10:26] his life and he began to tell us that
[1:10:29] it's God at work preparing you
[1:10:34] and if he's watched over your seed since
[1:10:37] the foundation of the world and he's got
[1:10:39] you here that means that there's work
[1:10:42] for you to do
[1:10:49] now
[1:10:51] I I want to just go over a few
[1:10:53] scriptures
[1:10:54] and I want you to think in an eternal
[1:10:56] realm and then the realm that you're
[1:10:58] you're in now
[1:11:01] the scripture says in Isaiah 54 and
[1:11:04] verse 17 no effort
[1:11:09] that is formed against thee
[1:11:11] shall prosper
[1:11:14] and every tongue that shall rise against
[1:11:16] thee in the judgment
[1:11:19] Thou shalt condemn
[1:11:24] you will judge the Demons of hell
[1:11:29] because of you are who you are
[1:11:33] if Satan knew how powerful this group
[1:11:38] and groups like you around the world
[1:11:41] if he knew what a position that you
[1:11:45] really had
[1:11:48] he would leave you alone 100 percent of
[1:11:51] the time
[1:11:53] because you're going to send him right
[1:11:56] straight to hell
[1:11:59] I say that very delicately but that's
[1:12:01] what God built for him and that's where
[1:12:04] he's going
[1:12:07] and that's his future
[1:12:12] now Philippians chapter 1 and verse 6.
[1:12:16] being confident of this very thing
[1:12:19] that he which hath begun a good work
[1:12:26] in you
[1:12:28] now notice these next words
[1:12:31] will perform it
[1:12:35] it's not like our our government
[1:12:38] maybe if
[1:12:40] lies
[1:12:42] God the Eternal God that said let there
[1:12:45] be a son
[1:12:47] now what was the results of that a son
[1:12:51] Let There Be Moons and stars what was
[1:12:54] the results of that
[1:12:57] a universe that we look up and it's
[1:13:00] God's first Bible
[1:13:02] so when God speaks it
[1:13:05] there may be some time before it's
[1:13:07] developed
[1:13:09] but you can take it to the bank
[1:13:16] Hallelujah
[1:13:18] Philippians chapter 4 and verse 13.
[1:13:23] Philippians 4 and verse 13. I want you
[1:13:26] to read this with me
[1:13:28] if you're the physical thoughts of God
[1:13:30] now there's work to do
[1:13:33] I can do all things
[1:13:36] through Christ
[1:13:37] which strengthens me
[1:13:41] let's not talk about brushing your teeth
[1:13:46] that's not talking about your natural
[1:13:47] deals
[1:13:51] but if God says it and I've got to
[1:13:53] fulfill it
[1:13:55] he will give me the strength to do it
[1:14:00] are you with me
[1:14:03] that could go a lot of directions there
[1:14:05] Ephesians chapter 6 and verse 10.
[1:14:08] finally my brethren
[1:14:10] be strong in the Lord
[1:14:13] and in the power of His might and put on
[1:14:16] the whole armor of God that you may be
[1:14:18] able to stand
[1:14:19] Against The Wiles of the devil for we
[1:14:23] wrestle we wrestle not against flesh and
[1:14:26] blood
[1:14:27] but against principalities
[1:14:31] against powers
[1:14:33] against the rulers of the darkness of
[1:14:35] this world against spiritual wickedness
[1:14:38] in high places
[1:14:45] your Wars not with one another
[1:14:48] let me just remind you it's the devil
[1:14:50] that will try to get between you and
[1:14:54] your wife your brother your sister or
[1:14:56] your your neighbor trying to cause
[1:14:58] things to cause your mind to be
[1:15:00] afflicted
[1:15:02] he'll steal a week from you
[1:15:05] over just a few words of conversation
[1:15:11] he'll knows that you're living in a body
[1:15:13] that's not born again
[1:15:16] but there's a holy ghost on the inside
[1:15:18] of you that is takes dominion over your
[1:15:21] flesh
[1:15:22] and if he can just raise that temper
[1:15:25] upper raise that old Garage chopper
[1:15:27] raise those old memories up he'll
[1:15:30] destroy weeks of your life
[1:15:33] over nothing
[1:15:38] have you ever heard that statement Much
[1:15:40] Ado About Nothing
[1:15:47] I was in a brother and sister's home
[1:15:49] where I was I was there and
[1:15:51] and I could tell that there was tension
[1:15:54] in the room and I was eating some cereal
[1:15:56] and
[1:15:57] you know and they were sitting they were
[1:15:59] elderly coupled and they were sitting
[1:16:01] there I mean literally they fell out of
[1:16:03] heaven right on the earth and I mean
[1:16:06] they're just awesome awesome people and
[1:16:09] I'm sitting there and here he set him
[1:16:11] aside of me she's setting across it's
[1:16:13] about a maybe a four by four table and
[1:16:16] you know I walked in the room I've got
[1:16:18] to preach this morning and my children
[1:16:20] are downstairs you guys were small and
[1:16:22] we were downstairs and you know I I said
[1:16:25] okay
[1:16:27] okay
[1:16:28] what's all the tension in the room about
[1:16:32] these angels
[1:16:38] he didn't mow the yard right
[1:16:44] he didn't mow the yard right What
[1:16:46] mattered
[1:16:49] what matter does what does it matter
[1:16:51] it's going to grow up and it's like a
[1:16:53] bad haircut
[1:16:57] in two weeks you do it again
[1:17:02] next week you'll mow the yard again
[1:17:06] when it rains it'll grow up put a little
[1:17:08] fertilizer on integral
[1:17:12] we were getting ready to go to church
[1:17:18] it's been a few days over this yard
[1:17:27] how many is punching each other right
[1:17:29] now
[1:17:37] we allow very temporary circumstances to
[1:17:40] baffle us
[1:17:49] I want that to sink in just for a moment
[1:17:54] brother Wayne was preached the other
[1:17:56] night and
[1:17:57] you know
[1:17:59] I think about when
[1:18:01] you know maybe a year from now I'll be
[1:18:03] preaching a certain meeting you know God
[1:18:05] orchestrates that you know and maybe
[1:18:08] eight months ago I was invited to
[1:18:11] brother Josh Bennett's
[1:18:12] and you know you know Seth and Sarah
[1:18:15] Beth set the date and I'm going to be
[1:18:18] here on Friday night I'm going to I'm
[1:18:20] going to drive down there on Saturday
[1:18:23] morning be at the meeting and brother
[1:18:24] Wayne is going to speak
[1:18:26] and he comes right to the end of the
[1:18:29] service and now God's got a word for me
[1:18:33] you ever said in a service and then all
[1:18:35] of a sudden you know okay now it's me
[1:18:37] and God
[1:18:39] it's now me and God now you know now
[1:18:42] it's not Wayne and God and Wayne and me
[1:18:44] and now it's me and God
[1:18:48] and so I'm sitting there and then he
[1:18:50] begins to speak on being afflicted
[1:18:56] in this body being afflicted
[1:18:59] and living with an affliction
[1:19:01] and that Affliction sometimes lasts your
[1:19:04] whole life
[1:19:05] and he mentions brother Tim Pruitt and
[1:19:08] how he was afflicted as a child with
[1:19:11] those crippled feet
[1:19:13] and brother Tim stands there and he's
[1:19:15] had a phenomenal amount of operations on
[1:19:18] those feet and those feet
[1:19:20] so weary weary him
[1:19:24] that's in the background that he has to
[1:19:26] wrestle with and he still stands and he
[1:19:29] preaches a couple of hours and and
[1:19:32] people miss the point
[1:19:35] two hours and he's preaching all of his
[1:19:37] mighties give his whole life and you're
[1:19:40] only getting a glimpse of all the
[1:19:41] studies he's made in his life in that
[1:19:44] particular night
[1:19:47] and yet he's wrestling with his feet
[1:19:51] Paul had the same issues heif was
[1:19:54] afflicted for this thing he besought the
[1:19:56] Lord Thrice that it might depart from
[1:19:59] him and then God spoke to him and said
[1:20:01] but my grace is sufficient
[1:20:07] and then then he just turns and brother
[1:20:09] Josh is sitting there with a his father
[1:20:12] he's fought a kidney stone now for
[1:20:14] months
[1:20:16] months he's fought this kidney stone
[1:20:18] brother Josh has taken pain pills and
[1:20:21] several of them just before the service
[1:20:23] and you could just tell he was a little
[1:20:25] bit hazy in his thought process and he
[1:20:28] was sitting just there and then he's
[1:20:30] then he's listened to this sermon
[1:20:32] and the statement was you're Afflicted
[1:20:36] but you're not defeated
[1:20:40] you're talking about a phenomenal word
[1:20:42] from God
[1:20:43] listen God owns it all
[1:20:47] God could have stopped it in a moment
[1:20:49] but he allowed your flesh I'm going
[1:20:52] somewhere here now he allowed your flesh
[1:20:54] to be afflicted
[1:20:56] but that's not the Eternal part
[1:21:01] that's not the Eternal part of you your
[1:21:03] body the worms will eat you up
[1:21:07] they won't crawl from another place
[1:21:09] they're in your body
[1:21:12] so when you die those worms come to life
[1:21:16] every one of you full of worms
[1:21:19] I don't care how much castor oil that
[1:21:21] you drink Connie
[1:21:23] [Applause]
[1:21:26] every one of you are full of worms the
[1:21:29] moment your body begins to die after 72
[1:21:32] hours those worms on the inside of you
[1:21:36] begins to eat your body
[1:21:40] brother Ron that's nasty brother random
[1:21:42] said you watch that girl twisting down
[1:21:44] the street he said you watch don't lust
[1:21:46] after her she's full of worms
[1:21:51] reason that's so real to me my daddy
[1:21:53] would tell me Ron don't you look at that
[1:21:55] she's full of worms
[1:21:58] I finally married a girl she's full of
[1:22:01] worms
[1:22:02] [Applause]
[1:22:13] and then he brought me up on the stage
[1:22:16] and they said here's a man
[1:22:19] with four stage cancer
[1:22:21] listen I I don't know if you've been to
[1:22:23] the doctor and the word see
[1:22:25] has came out of that doctor's mouth
[1:22:28] but let me just say when it's you
[1:22:33] you know you can pray for hundreds of
[1:22:35] people through your life and then all of
[1:22:36] a sudden you're the one in the are you
[1:22:38] with me
[1:22:39] and all of a sudden he's saying you've
[1:22:41] got cancer
[1:22:43] and now it's more than an if they did
[1:22:45] the test
[1:22:47] now they've pulled the the cells out of
[1:22:49] that cancer and they tell what it is now
[1:22:51] you're on chemo now in three years of
[1:22:54] chemo three plus years of chemo
[1:23:00] you know you're in a battle
[1:23:03] listen you know that you're in a battle
[1:23:05] but listen
[1:23:07] in my perspective I just move forward
[1:23:12] if Satan could have killed me he already
[1:23:14] would have
[1:23:17] [Applause]
[1:23:22] if he could have we already would have
[1:23:26] and listen let me just say I'm not the
[1:23:28] only one under a death sentence you are
[1:23:31] too
[1:23:32] foreign
[1:23:34] would destroy you because you destroy
[1:23:37] his atmosphere
[1:23:40] if you only knew what Satan was trying
[1:23:43] to do this week to you
[1:23:47] this week to you he would have destroyed
[1:23:50] you this week but God preserved you
[1:23:56] or brother on it does Justin seem like
[1:23:58] anything that's Supernatural is going on
[1:24:00] really
[1:24:02] really he's armed all of hell to come
[1:24:05] against you
[1:24:07] he's got every tick tock he's got every
[1:24:10] Facebook he's got everything that he can
[1:24:12] to bombard your mind and you still come
[1:24:15] to church
[1:24:17] as though nothing's going on
[1:24:21] [Applause]
[1:24:24] what have you overcome just to get here
[1:24:29] things you have no idea about
[1:24:36] in that same service
[1:24:39] I was sitting I was sitting kind of on
[1:24:41] the front row Where You Are
[1:24:43] and I was sitting in the meeting and
[1:24:46] there's a girl playing the organ
[1:24:48] and I'm just sitting there as innocent I
[1:24:50] can be I'm enjoying the service I'm not
[1:24:51] preaching I'm enjoying the service
[1:24:55] and as I'm sitting there the Lord speaks
[1:24:57] to me and says you'll pray for her
[1:24:59] tonight
[1:25:01] and this is what I want you to tell her
[1:25:06] I can't make that happen
[1:25:09] I I can't let me just say I can't make
[1:25:11] that happen
[1:25:13] so I sat there
[1:25:15] and brother Wayne finishes
[1:25:17] and then one by one people begin to come
[1:25:21] and I'm helping brother Wayne and the
[1:25:22] other brothers pray and we're praying
[1:25:25] for one by one we watch things as they
[1:25:27] begin to happen and we probably paid
[1:25:29] pray for 15. and I turn in there stands
[1:25:32] that girl
[1:25:37] and so I just let brother Wayne pray I
[1:25:39] let him lead her lead in prayer we
[1:25:41] prayed for
[1:25:43] you know she was she was there
[1:25:45] and I called her by name
[1:25:47] I said
[1:25:50] I told her I said before before
[1:25:54] the prayer line started the Lord spoke
[1:25:57] to me that I pray for you
[1:25:59] and you're here
[1:26:02] and this is what the Lord told me to
[1:26:04] tell you
[1:26:06] here's a woman that has fought kidney
[1:26:08] disease
[1:26:10] for years
[1:26:13] incredible amount of kidney stones
[1:26:15] passed through her kidneys
[1:26:19] incredible disease that she has fought
[1:26:22] and I told her what the Lord told me to
[1:26:25] tell her she danced all over that
[1:26:29] building it didn't have nothing to do
[1:26:31] with the disease
[1:26:35] it had to do with the Eternal part of
[1:26:39] her life
[1:26:42] it had to do with the question about
[1:26:46] eternal life
[1:26:49] I feel like shouting
[1:26:51] girl danced all over that building she
[1:26:54] went to the doctor maybe on Tuesday
[1:26:55] maybe Monday I don't know for sure and I
[1:26:58] I haven't looked back at the text listen
[1:27:01] the doctor called her absolutely totally
[1:27:04] free
[1:27:16] so I declare to you we can walk into the
[1:27:19] building one way
[1:27:21] and walk out of the building a complete
[1:27:23] different way
[1:27:32] Hallelujah
[1:27:33] [Applause]
[1:27:50] did that did that eradicate all of her
[1:27:52] problems
[1:27:54] the enemy don't give up
[1:27:57] on Saturday morning she's an ER with a
[1:28:00] UTI
[1:28:02] completely unrelated
[1:28:04] she's healed
[1:28:07] but here's the enemy he's not just going
[1:28:09] to quit
[1:28:11] and roll over
[1:28:18] I was prepared to preach at brother
[1:28:20] Donnie Reagan's
[1:28:25] I'm going to skip but
[1:28:29] I went home after the service that
[1:28:30] brother Josh's let me just drop this
[1:28:33] here
[1:28:33] and I thought well I'm prepared for in
[1:28:35] the morning
[1:28:36] I was
[1:28:38] he had to get me there
[1:28:41] so I went to bed and at 12 o'clock
[1:28:45] he woke me up and said this is what
[1:28:47] you'll preach tomorrow complete
[1:28:49] different thought well done
[1:28:53] and I studied from 12 o'clock to two
[1:28:56] o'clock Connie's in bed
[1:29:00] 12 to 2
[1:29:02] I go to bed at four o'clock there's some
[1:29:05] more Touches for it so I'm back up for
[1:29:08] another half an hour I go to bed I go
[1:29:11] right back to sleep I'm a good sleeper I
[1:29:13] go back to sleep five o'clock I'm back
[1:29:15] up and working again
[1:29:18] then I wake up at eight o'clock and I'm
[1:29:20] too late you can't win
[1:29:25] gotta pack all my clothes I gotta get
[1:29:28] everything ready now I'm nervous
[1:29:31] I I made everybody for breakfast in the
[1:29:34] morning and I'm going you know I'm late
[1:29:36] they said it won't start till you're
[1:29:38] there
[1:29:42] the lady at the at the table she's
[1:29:44] waiting our table she's just a really
[1:29:47] kind wonderful person she starts talking
[1:29:49] to me like she's known me all of her
[1:29:51] life I've never seen her before I've
[1:29:53] never stayed in a hotel before and she
[1:29:55] begins to talk to me about my family
[1:29:58] wow that's pretty impressive but she was
[1:30:00] just a people person
[1:30:04] calm me right down
[1:30:07] God knows exactly what you need
[1:30:10] in your moment
[1:30:14] then I go to brother Donnie Reagan's and
[1:30:16] the Lord begins to deal with me for what
[1:30:19] I've got is not going to work
[1:30:21] and he begins to deal with me that
[1:30:26] Jesus is coming to your house
[1:30:29] I want you to think about that just for
[1:30:31] a moment
[1:30:32] brother Brown says indoors in a door I'm
[1:30:34] not going to get to my thought here for
[1:30:36] a few moments but
[1:30:38] he said if the queen would come to your
[1:30:40] door you'd be so excited you'd do
[1:30:42] everything you could to take care of her
[1:30:45] if the president would come to your door
[1:30:49] listen I don't care what
[1:30:51] what his thoughts would be but he came
[1:30:52] to your door
[1:30:54] you'd want to you'd want to fix him the
[1:30:56] best that you could fix him you won't
[1:30:57] even sit him in your chair you'd you'd
[1:31:00] want him to enjoy the moment that he's
[1:31:02] there but a greater than a queen and
[1:31:05] greater than a president brother Bram
[1:31:07] said Jesus wants to come to your door
[1:31:11] he wanted to come to laodicea and they
[1:31:14] didn't want him but there was a group of
[1:31:16] people that said come on in our house
[1:31:20] come on in our house
[1:31:23] brother Ron how do you know they don't
[1:31:24] want him they make rules and every year
[1:31:28] their rules change and they argue about
[1:31:30] the rules and when Jesus wanted to come
[1:31:37] they've changed the word so much he
[1:31:40] can't even identify with his own
[1:31:41] scripture
[1:31:45] that's why when he sees you he sees
[1:31:48] himself
[1:31:51] your amen should have been better than
[1:31:53] that
[1:31:58] sister Erica
[1:32:00] Parker
[1:32:02] had came to Saturday evening's meeting
[1:32:05] and her request was when the Lord
[1:32:09] comes down in the prayer line
[1:32:12] I would like to be when he comes there
[1:32:14] into Pearland not being selfish
[1:32:17] but I want to be there when he's there
[1:32:21] not just when preachers are there but
[1:32:22] when he's there
[1:32:25] so we had brother J.D Whitson which will
[1:32:27] be here in our Labor Day meeting
[1:32:29] standing behind me
[1:32:32] and brother Donnie's words to me said
[1:32:34] when you feel it's a good time for Erica
[1:32:36] to come
[1:32:41] will you will you send JD to come get
[1:32:44] her
[1:32:46] the prayer line was going on and I don't
[1:32:48] know how many we had prayed for
[1:32:51] and I turned to Brother JD and I said
[1:32:53] Now's the Time
[1:32:55] brother Tim Pruitt and myself were
[1:32:57] sitting at breakfast the next morning he
[1:32:59] said how did you know I said I saw him
[1:33:01] there
[1:33:04] he said you know I I can feel him but I
[1:33:06] don't see that
[1:33:10] and he said what did he look like and I
[1:33:11] said it looked like a man taller than us
[1:33:14] but look like a man
[1:33:17] like a white figure standing there
[1:33:22] listen you can't make that up
[1:33:25] and I don't care what the critic says
[1:33:27] but without him we can't do nothing
[1:33:32] we're commissioned to lay hands on the
[1:33:34] sick and they shall recover
[1:33:36] we're commissioned to lay hands and
[1:33:39] anoint with all and and they'll be
[1:33:41] healed
[1:33:44] listen moments of time let me just say
[1:33:47] if it's just a second or if it's a
[1:33:49] minute we need to capture everything
[1:33:51] that there is about that moment
[1:33:55] are you with me now my mind just goes a
[1:33:58] lot of places brother Frazier was
[1:34:00] praying for brother Abby
[1:34:03] in the veterans home and when he was
[1:34:05] praying for him there was two women came
[1:34:07] and said will you pray for my brother
[1:34:10] and and and they told him said now
[1:34:13] listen listen man of God is going to
[1:34:16] pray for you and you're going to get
[1:34:17] well
[1:34:19] never been in our church it's never been
[1:34:21] heard of brother Homer preach but you're
[1:34:24] gonna get well
[1:34:27] and and brother Homer literally just
[1:34:29] anointing with all and prayed for him
[1:34:31] just a prayer and then and then then
[1:34:34] went prayed for brother Abby and spent
[1:34:37] time with brother Abby
[1:34:38] about a two weeks later he goes back and
[1:34:41] brother Homer looks over the bed is
[1:34:43] empty he said he must have passed away
[1:34:44] he said oh no after you prayed for him
[1:34:48] he got up and went home
[1:35:01] brother Abby was a phenomenal man God
[1:35:04] rescued him in the middle of a of a war
[1:35:06] with their submarine going down let me
[1:35:09] just say that predestinated seed is the
[1:35:12] Eternal part of you you may go through a
[1:35:15] lot of difficult things
[1:35:19] when God came down to job
[1:35:25] when God came to job
[1:35:27] had the days that me and you'll never
[1:35:30] fight
[1:35:34] me and you've had some incredible days
[1:35:36] but we never had days like job had
[1:35:39] he lost all of his wealth
[1:35:41] he lost all all of his children
[1:35:45] he lost his health
[1:35:47] his wife turned against him his friends
[1:35:49] turned against him
[1:35:50] and then God came he always comes in
[1:35:53] trouble he'll come don't you worry
[1:35:55] he's never too late
[1:35:58] and God came to it
[1:36:03] listen it's not a time to be fussy with
[1:36:05] God
[1:36:06] and God came to him
[1:36:08] and when God came to him
[1:36:11] God never talked to him about his balls
[1:36:13] on his flesh he never talked about his
[1:36:16] finances he never talked to him about
[1:36:18] his children
[1:36:22] is God concerned about all of all of
[1:36:25] your natural things
[1:36:27] he knows he'll take care of that
[1:36:31] he knows he'll take care of that
[1:36:34] he owns the whole world he'll take care
[1:36:35] of that
[1:36:38] glad in this infinite mindset I'm going
[1:36:40] to restore your children I'm going to
[1:36:42] restore your wealth you're going to be
[1:36:43] much richer than you ever was your
[1:36:46] wife's going to get over her problems
[1:36:49] all your critics are going to make be
[1:36:51] made Liars
[1:36:53] God knew all that but he didn't tell him
[1:36:55] [Applause]
[1:36:57] he talked to him about the Eternal Realm
[1:37:01] where was you job when I made the when I
[1:37:05] made the foundations of the Earth where
[1:37:06] was you at
[1:37:09] when I created it all when I spoke it
[1:37:11] into existence where was you at he was
[1:37:14] reminding him that job you was in me
[1:37:19] job you're not you're this may be your
[1:37:21] temporary part of your life but you was
[1:37:24] in me
[1:37:26] when all this is over
[1:37:31] listen when God raised up Lazarus and
[1:37:34] brought him back to this realm Lazarus
[1:37:36] had to die again
[1:37:39] you know the story wasn't over that he
[1:37:41] just went floating through the iron
[1:37:42] Lazarus had to get sick Lazarus had to
[1:37:45] go through turmoil he had to listen to
[1:37:47] the political problems and listen all
[1:37:49] the nonsense he had to listen to the
[1:37:51] wars
[1:37:52] but he had been in that Realm
[1:37:55] he was never scared to death ever again
[1:38:01] I hope you're getting this
[1:38:04] job
[1:38:07] when the sons of God shouted so God took
[1:38:11] him before the foundation of the world
[1:38:13] and then he took him to the end
[1:38:16] now can I make a Quantum Leap
[1:38:21] brother Branham is questioning
[1:38:24] have I done anything for God
[1:38:29] if you'll think about the time period
[1:38:31] brother Steve of
[1:38:32] were he's actually thinking now
[1:38:37] there's a rejection going on about his
[1:38:39] ministry
[1:38:41] is a rejection
[1:38:45] you felt some of it yourself
[1:38:48] you handed out books I don't want that
[1:38:51] but they did
[1:38:55] yeah they did
[1:38:56] God sent you to your job
[1:38:59] with a burden on your heart
[1:39:01] for a certain individual
[1:39:03] and God had seeds that were hungry
[1:39:06] this would be generational
[1:39:10] did that mean your problems was over did
[1:39:12] that mean you'd
[1:39:14] lose your job no the purpose was done
[1:39:17] now I got to move you
[1:39:20] but the Eternal part of you was settled
[1:39:27] it was settled
[1:39:32] what does that say about what happened
[1:39:34] there
[1:39:35] listen the songs that your sins are more
[1:39:37] than songs
[1:39:40] I came out last night and you were
[1:39:42] standing there singing and I thought
[1:39:44] about the big picture
[1:39:47] I thought about the big picture in your
[1:39:49] life
[1:39:50] I'll never forget a very hard time in
[1:39:54] your life
[1:39:55] and I walked past you at a table and it
[1:39:58] was full of drinks
[1:39:59] and you was embarrassed about that God
[1:40:02] spoke to my heart that's my son
[1:40:05] I didn't talk about the nonsense to you
[1:40:07] I didn't talk about the difficulties of
[1:40:10] your life God dropped it in my heart
[1:40:12] that's my son
[1:40:14] and if he's your son
[1:40:17] if you're a son of God
[1:40:19] you don't have to worry about the little
[1:40:21] temporary things
[1:40:23] God's got it shout out
[1:40:26] [Applause]
[1:40:51] foreign
[1:40:58] I was
[1:41:01] sister Delores you're involved in this
[1:41:04] I was on my way to Canada
[1:41:07] to preach three meetings for brother
[1:41:09] biscoll and brother Tom
[1:41:11] the first meeting was courage
[1:41:14] the second was go wash
[1:41:17] and the third was take it back
[1:41:20] and you call Connie and told her get a
[1:41:24] ticket
[1:41:24] and be with brother Ron he's going to
[1:41:26] have news
[1:41:28] we feel like he's going to get a call
[1:41:31] and then we don't want him to be by
[1:41:32] himself is that right
[1:41:37] any of you that's ever flew
[1:41:39] knows it's
[1:41:41] once you once you you can't hardly get
[1:41:43] on the same flight once it's right up to
[1:41:46] time
[1:41:48] Connie made the call
[1:41:50] literally
[1:41:51] like the day before
[1:41:54] and said this is our situation
[1:41:58] we had three flights each way
[1:42:01] and God arranged it that she was able to
[1:42:04] sit beside of me
[1:42:08] all six flights
[1:42:15] because he knew help me now he knew she
[1:42:20] would be there and need to be
[1:42:26] sometimes we think about the impossible
[1:42:28] things
[1:42:29] with God there's nothing impossible
[1:42:36] five minutes before we were to leave the
[1:42:39] hotel room
[1:42:40] I get a call
[1:42:43] and the call is you have a tumor in your
[1:42:46] lungs
[1:42:47] we believe it to be cancer
[1:42:50] let me just tell you that hits you like
[1:42:52] a ton of bricks
[1:42:54] but God spoke to me said what are you
[1:42:57] preaching
[1:43:00] who are you preaching for
[1:43:02] brother Briscoe had had an interview
[1:43:05] with Charlie Mitchell
[1:43:10] at the Roanoke television broadcast
[1:43:14] and Charlie and brother Ed sat there and
[1:43:18] did a 30-minute interview never had to
[1:43:21] take a break
[1:43:24] and the producers at the television
[1:43:26] broadcast said this never happens
[1:43:31] when we do advertisements
[1:43:33] when we do political interviews we have
[1:43:36] to stop and start over stop and start
[1:43:38] over stop and start over to make sure
[1:43:40] that we get it right and you two men
[1:43:43] one from Canada and one's from West
[1:43:45] Virginia sat down and began to have an
[1:43:48] interview
[1:43:50] and you go 30 minutes without a break
[1:43:54] and brother biscoll just looked at her
[1:43:56] said we're telling the truth
[1:43:59] [Applause]
[1:44:08] and Charlie Mitchell had a tumor in his
[1:44:11] lung and he said when brother Branham
[1:44:13] called him out he said I saw an eye
[1:44:15] coming at me I grew up under his
[1:44:17] ministry he said I I saw an eye coming
[1:44:20] at me and it wasn't brother Brown he
[1:44:22] said but I saw an eye coming at me
[1:44:25] and he told him where he was from where
[1:44:28] the tumor was
[1:44:29] go home you'll be well
[1:44:32] when I walked in that pulpit
[1:44:35] I had a confidence if God had me here in
[1:44:40] British Columbia and say preaching
[1:44:43] with a man decades ago that had that
[1:44:46] interview
[1:44:48] then God had my situation that would get
[1:44:51] much worse under control
[1:44:57] [Applause]
[1:45:16] okay on time
[1:45:22] I always like to watch for results
[1:45:27] you're here because of results
[1:45:31] you're here because of results
[1:45:34] God speaks it then there's results
[1:45:36] happen
[1:45:37] you're here because of results I never
[1:45:40] forget the world of fire that came down
[1:45:42] over you
[1:45:43] I came to you remember that
[1:45:47] you know nothing about what we believed
[1:45:49] but there was something on the inside of
[1:45:51] you that
[1:45:52] it's real
[1:45:54] you're not sitting back there you're up
[1:45:55] here
[1:45:57] feel different
[1:46:04] the meeting was over
[1:46:06] it was quite a group of people that was
[1:46:08] in brother Tom Ray's Church
[1:46:10] in his house
[1:46:12] I know I was just standing I was
[1:46:15] standing against the fireplace to stand
[1:46:17] in there
[1:46:18] brother Murphy who is the mouthpiece to
[1:46:20] China That's translated over 500
[1:46:23] messages maybe 600 by this point
[1:46:26] who is the William Branham of of China
[1:46:29] and I just kind of feel like a small
[1:46:31] small boy compared to what his ministry
[1:46:34] has done
[1:46:35] and I'm standing there with him you know
[1:46:38] God's not really intimidated by putting
[1:46:40] you under pressure
[1:46:42] now I'm at my sermon I won't be much
[1:46:45] longer
[1:46:46] God's not intimidated by putting you
[1:46:48] under pressure
[1:46:52] and I saw a vision
[1:46:54] and I said Murphy
[1:46:56] I see you with a baby well he was
[1:46:59] thinking it was about himself
[1:47:02] no brother
[1:47:04] no his children's grown no brother no no
[1:47:07] no no no your daughter
[1:47:10] they didn't know that was impossible for
[1:47:12] them to have children
[1:47:16] you know we rejoiced we stood there and
[1:47:18] rejoiced it you know we talked about it
[1:47:20] and others came over we talked by the
[1:47:22] time and I talked
[1:47:29] months would pass by
[1:47:31] I'm in an office with a
[1:47:34] with a doctor
[1:47:36] and the doctor
[1:47:37] explains to me how terminal I was he
[1:47:40] said do you understand terminal
[1:47:43] because I don't think you understand do
[1:47:44] you understand terminal
[1:47:46] I said I got a good idea do you
[1:47:48] understand it well you know that kind of
[1:47:50] those kind of conversations are real
[1:47:51] difficult to have
[1:47:57] and so I'm sitting sister Connie has an
[1:48:00] appointment so I'm sitting in the car
[1:48:01] waiting on her to get out of her eye
[1:48:04] appointment and I'm sitting in the car
[1:48:06] and I'm just kind of thinking on my
[1:48:08] mind's just kind of whirling
[1:48:10] and I'm sitting in the car and Murphy
[1:48:12] Wong calls me
[1:48:15] and he calls me and I look that's
[1:48:17] interesting
[1:48:19] and his daughter had just been told it
[1:48:22] was impossible for her to have children
[1:48:27] and I said well brother Murphy here's
[1:48:29] the deal I just came out of an office
[1:48:31] where they told me I was terminal
[1:48:33] and you're telling me that your daughter
[1:48:35] it's impossible for her to have children
[1:48:37] I don't believe this is just an
[1:48:39] insignificant call
[1:48:41] I said but if God's going to heal me I
[1:48:44] believe that and if God's going to have
[1:48:46] showed us that you're going to have a
[1:48:47] baby I believe that
[1:48:50] right
[1:48:53] it's that in between details
[1:48:57] now I'm preaching
[1:48:58] it's that in between details
[1:49:02] that Satan Wars in your mind because
[1:49:05] you're a human
[1:49:10] but it's the Eternal part and that
[1:49:13] little girl that little baby
[1:49:16] had to come because she was written in
[1:49:19] the Lamb's Book
[1:49:28] and all of Hell couldn't stop it
[1:49:33] I'd say this all of hell can't stop you
[1:49:36] if you are predestinated sin
[1:49:42] how many meetings has Satan had in his
[1:49:45] realm
[1:49:46] after meetings that we preached and one
[1:49:50] come to the Lord another gets healed
[1:49:51] another gets filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:49:56] sister Connie do you know can you
[1:49:58] imagine how upset Satan was when you God
[1:50:02] begins to deal with you that you got to
[1:50:04] be in that service that Aaron is
[1:50:06] preaching
[1:50:11] unbeknownst to us as Humanity the
[1:50:14] difficulties I don't know the background
[1:50:16] but let me just say this to you God's
[1:50:19] God knows the temporary
[1:50:21] but God's interested in the eternal
[1:50:33] when I saw her
[1:50:35] I never seen it done before
[1:50:38] I never thought about it being done but
[1:50:40] I as a preacher I pull my coat off and
[1:50:42] wrapped it around her
[1:50:44] Andrew said you know what you did
[1:50:46] when that father son came home he took
[1:50:49] the best robe
[1:50:56] you walked into a very natural service
[1:50:58] but a very Supernatural happening takes
[1:51:01] place
[1:51:02] will there be trouble absolutely will
[1:51:05] there be turmoil absolutely
[1:51:08] but the Eternal part
[1:51:11] [Applause]
[1:51:29] I want to say this and this may be a
[1:51:32] hard statement for you to listen to
[1:51:36] I will go on the 20th
[1:51:39] to the doctors
[1:51:41] then I will go in August to the to the
[1:51:43] brain doctors
[1:51:45] and if they told me that I was one
[1:51:48] hundred percent without cancer
[1:51:52] I shout
[1:51:54] I dance
[1:51:56] I would scream it for the rest of my
[1:51:58] life
[1:52:01] but that don't mean I won't have more
[1:52:02] problems
[1:52:11] that won't mean you won't have more
[1:52:13] problems
[1:52:14] God totally heals you totally saves you
[1:52:17] totally fills you with the Holy Ghost
[1:52:18] don't mean that you won't have more
[1:52:21] issues
[1:52:29] just take brother Homer
[1:52:31] brother Homer preached he built this
[1:52:33] building he had incredible visionary
[1:52:36] incredible visionary
[1:52:38] but I was with him he had incredible
[1:52:40] problems
[1:52:43] one day we were with a tractor
[1:52:47] and we had problems
[1:52:49] he always had trouble with that tractor
[1:52:50] brother Thomas
[1:52:52] we had trouble with trying to hook
[1:52:54] something up
[1:52:57] we had incredible issues
[1:53:00] we got across the road in a tire went
[1:53:02] flat
[1:53:04] I'll never forget his response
[1:53:07] in spite of all the Devils doing he's
[1:53:09] not going to make me mad
[1:53:17] he's not going to make me mad listen it
[1:53:19] took an hour or so to fix that tire take
[1:53:22] it off it's front end Tire take it off
[1:53:25] take it and get it fixed put it back on
[1:53:30] but he's not going to make me mad
[1:53:33] you've had days that it looked like the
[1:53:36] whole world's falling up I'm talking to
[1:53:38] you now
[1:53:40] the whole world's falling apart
[1:53:43] but if you can look at the Eternal Realm
[1:53:47] we're not wrestling against flesh and
[1:53:49] blood into things that are here we're
[1:53:51] wrestling against principalities and
[1:53:53] powers and he's done everything that he
[1:53:56] can do to stop you from coming to church
[1:53:58] this light on you is cheated on you he's
[1:54:01] done every kind of thing that he can and
[1:54:03] you still come
[1:54:05] because you're not the one holding on
[1:54:12] you're not the one holding on he's
[1:54:16] holding on to you
[1:54:19] [Applause]
[1:54:31] quite a statement
[1:54:39] the end of the day
[1:54:42] whether by rapture
[1:54:44] or whether by Death
[1:54:47] this temporary life comes to an end
[1:54:54] I'm not discouraged in any of that
[1:54:57] that you know Spurgeon said don't worry
[1:55:00] about your end
[1:55:02] just worry about where you're going to
[1:55:04] wake up
[1:55:08] it's a pretty good statement
[1:55:12] I want you to think about how God got
[1:55:13] you here
[1:55:15] and sometimes we question
[1:55:17] God's never did a miracle for me
[1:55:20] I'm going to finish with this and start
[1:55:22] up next week or whenever I'm going to
[1:55:24] preach again
[1:55:25] but I want you to think about this
[1:55:27] well I've never seen a miracle brother
[1:55:29] Ron you are a miracle
[1:55:34] who
[1:55:36] are a miracle
[1:55:38] Devin
[1:55:42] you're a miracle
[1:55:46] you're a miracle not a doubt in my mind
[1:55:48] your family said she'll never last
[1:55:53] you had thoughts in your mind
[1:55:57] Satan did a lot of bombarding to her
[1:56:00] but let me just
[1:56:02] God ignores all your problems of your
[1:56:04] past
[1:56:06] because he knows your future
[1:56:08] [Music]
[1:56:10] well brother on if I was tall dark and
[1:56:13] handsome I'd be somebody
[1:56:18] you know if I look like this or look
[1:56:20] like that we're not here to pattern
[1:56:21] after Hollywood
[1:56:24] we're here to be like God
[1:56:36] well brother on I get so discouraged
[1:56:37] with the dress code Eddie listen it's
[1:56:40] God's thoughts it's like
[1:56:43] we're not here to pattern after Sodom
[1:56:45] and Gomorrah
[1:56:47] at the end of the day we want to go hear
[1:56:48] him say Well done
[1:56:51] I could care less what Hollywood thinks
[1:56:53] of us and the government thinks of us
[1:56:55] and the school thinks of us I want to
[1:56:57] hear God say Well done
[1:57:00] [Applause]
[1:57:07] but I had to clean out all my music
[1:57:09] great
[1:57:10] I had to clean out all of my britches
[1:57:12] I'm talking to women I had to pull out
[1:57:14] all my britches and all the nonsense in
[1:57:16] my bikinis and throw it away God
[1:57:21] I had to throw The Honky Tonks away glad
[1:57:23] I had to throw my dope away
[1:57:26] Biden we see you throwed some dope away
[1:57:28] too
[1:57:35] that was just convenient
[1:57:38] I didn't pre-arrange that that was just
[1:57:40] convenient
[1:57:46] but it was good it was good it was good
[1:57:51] my brother Ron I had to get rid of this
[1:57:53] and I had to get rid of my pornography
[1:57:55] and I had to get rid of all the
[1:57:56] gossiping and I
[1:57:59] I had to get a new mind I had to get a
[1:58:01] new tongue
[1:58:02] a lot of stuff used to come across that
[1:58:04] tongue when I get mad a lot of stuff
[1:58:06] fall out of there
[1:58:10] I'm talking to you I know where you're
[1:58:11] at
[1:58:12] I live with you I know where you're at
[1:58:23] here's where it is
[1:58:26] some of you been here since 74 73
[1:58:32] and you think well God's got to be done
[1:58:34] with me by now now
[1:58:37] no
[1:58:38] he well I don't need to hear all them
[1:58:40] sermons
[1:58:44] okay
[1:58:45] okay I got to you
[1:58:47] I got to you now
[1:58:49] there was a man asked Michelangelo when
[1:58:51] he's working on a certain piece of art
[1:58:56] so what do you see in that rock he said
[1:58:57] well Moses is sitting there
[1:59:01] he said I don't see him he said
[1:59:03] well how do you know if you're getting
[1:59:05] into Moses he said well what I'm doing
[1:59:08] is getting the excess off of him
[1:59:13] [Laughter]
[1:59:15] now you know when he first started out
[1:59:17] great big chunks fell off
[1:59:20] but he got down to where there was some
[1:59:22] little bitty rocks
[1:59:26] and then he had to not take a chipping
[1:59:29] hammer no more
[1:59:31] but it had to take five
[1:59:35] and then he had to take a certain type
[1:59:37] of
[1:59:41] cloth
[1:59:43] I'm looking for something else but I'm
[1:59:44] not finding it screened like a screen
[1:59:46] somebody some somebody's a contractor
[1:59:48] Terry tell me where I'm tell him tell me
[1:59:50] what I'm looking for here
[1:59:51] he's got to take something to scrub that
[1:59:53] edge off
[2:00:00] planer that'll work
[2:00:03] now you know if you're a casual Observer
[2:00:05] you go wow that Moses looking good but
[2:00:08] you wasn't there
[2:00:10] you weren't now when it started out
[2:00:13] why Moses looking good
[2:00:17] he's looking really good I see him
[2:00:20] but you didn't see him
[2:00:22] why
[2:00:23] when it was a great big rock
[2:00:25] some of you came in here 40 years ago
[2:00:27] and you were a big old rock
[2:00:32] and Homer beat on you for a while
[2:00:35] scrubbed on you a while you pulled your
[2:00:38] toes back up under the seat for a while
[2:00:40] you had your name called you got mad you
[2:00:45] got frustrated why me
[2:00:49] and then a redhead shows up and because
[2:00:53] of you I did great
[2:01:01] [Applause]
[2:01:03] because God's just not working on you
[2:01:05] he's working on me
[2:01:15] that's good ain't that good
[2:01:18] and the guy behind me is redheaded but
[2:01:20] he stays around you long enough
[2:01:34] the stone that the builders rejected
[2:01:38] they looking for everything else a lot
[2:01:41] of people have rejected Christ
[2:01:44] and they turned him down
[2:01:46] but it was a keystone
[2:01:49] it was a keystone
[2:01:50] brother Ron when when will God get done
[2:01:54] Rapture morning
[2:01:57] not a doubt in my mind on Rapture
[2:01:59] Mourning
[2:02:01] you and your wife might have a tiff
[2:02:08] maybe you had a tip this morning
[2:02:11] before you came to church
[2:02:20] and you came to church and you said in
[2:02:22] your Pew maybe somebody else got you a
[2:02:24] seat
[2:02:25] and that caused you to have another
[2:02:26] teeth
[2:02:34] reserve seats here
[2:02:36] and then
[2:02:38] you know Matthew sung a song that you
[2:02:39] didn't know the words to
[2:02:45] why did that why did that girl get to
[2:02:47] sing and she sings well done
[2:02:50] God orchestrates it
[2:02:55] don't worry about it Jesus shows up
[2:02:57] exactly on time
[2:03:01] now let me just say
[2:03:03] the miracle of getting you here
[2:03:06] and spending 40 years with you to shape
[2:03:10] you
[2:03:15] he didn't do it just to waste his time
[2:03:19] got a whole book of troubles that you've
[2:03:22] had
[2:03:27] you've got a whole book of troubles that
[2:03:30] you've had
[2:03:31] and you could
[2:03:33] now you could send a whole book in of
[2:03:35] all the things that you went through in
[2:03:37] your life
[2:03:39] and it don't even matter
[2:03:47] the wrong way
[2:03:51] it's like getting a bad haircut
[2:03:55] it grow out
[2:03:58] next Saturday will come
[2:04:04] and if it don't come you'll be shaking
[2:04:07] hands with people that we long to shake
[2:04:09] hands with
[2:04:12] I want to finish this because I didn't
[2:04:14] finish it I actually preached one page
[2:04:16] today so that was nice wasn't it
[2:04:24] you know I I want to please I want to
[2:04:26] please you as an audience
[2:04:30] I really want to please sister Connie 40
[2:04:32] years she got the ring
[2:04:36] for putting up with me
[2:04:39] I really like pleasing her
[2:04:41] I really do I really do whether she
[2:04:44] knows or not I really like to please her
[2:04:47] I haven't pleased her a whole lot but
[2:04:49] I've really you better try to please
[2:04:51] Gabrielle too you know
[2:04:56] but there's times that we won't please
[2:04:57] one another
[2:05:01] am I talking to you human beings
[2:05:05] David am I talking to you about it yeah
[2:05:10] but there's one I want to please
[2:05:15] there's one I want to please
[2:05:20] when brother Branham had his hands
[2:05:22] behind his head
[2:05:23] and he said I haven't done anything for
[2:05:25] you
[2:05:29] and the Lord didn't come down and remind
[2:05:32] him of all the things he had did he took
[2:05:34] him on a trip
[2:05:36] would you like to go beyond the curtain
[2:05:38] of time
[2:05:41] I'd like to go
[2:05:44] and the reason that God had to take him
[2:05:46] beyond the curtain of time because there
[2:05:47] was incredible words that needed to be
[2:05:49] preached and he needed to see that
[2:05:52] Eternal Realm
[2:05:53] so that when everybody turned him down
[2:05:56] he would know that part is already taken
[2:05:59] care of
[2:06:01] he would know without a shadow of a
[2:06:03] doubt as if Paul was if Paul was
[2:06:07] if he was given
[2:06:09] eternal life I preached the same thing
[2:06:11] Paul preached
[2:06:14] and when he sees all those people
[2:06:17] that have had incredible problems
[2:06:20] but they're there
[2:06:23] do you know that lady that just walked
[2:06:25] up and hugged you
[2:06:27] no I don't believe I do
[2:06:29] you led her to Christ when she was past
[2:06:31] 95.
[2:06:33] don't give her a hit don't give him a
[2:06:35] history lesson of what she was like on
[2:06:37] Earth
[2:06:38] but he shows her to him in an eternal
[2:06:41] Realm
[2:06:43] and then
[2:06:46] will I be judged for what I've preached
[2:06:49] well if so
[2:06:51] and I'm paraphrasing if so I preach what
[2:06:54] Paul preached
[2:06:57] I preached what Peter preached
[2:07:00] and a group of people screamed we're
[2:07:03] resting on that
[2:07:08] now God don't just see you here
[2:07:13] but literally a few feet from you
[2:07:16] you girls especially
[2:07:18] there's an there's a theotheny body
[2:07:22] that's there to watch over you
[2:07:25] because Jesus said let not your heart be
[2:07:27] troubled you believe in God believe us
[2:07:30] in me I go to prepare
[2:07:33] so he's got a body already waiting on
[2:07:36] you
[2:07:41] so in this realm we sure want to please
[2:07:44] one another but there's another Realm
[2:07:48] that we want to hear these two words
[2:07:51] said
[2:07:52] well done
[2:08:18] brother Timothy I want to pray with you

[2:08:46] but God's already got the Eternal part
[2:08:48] taken care of
[2:08:50] but the temporary marries a whole lot in
[2:08:52] this particular moment
