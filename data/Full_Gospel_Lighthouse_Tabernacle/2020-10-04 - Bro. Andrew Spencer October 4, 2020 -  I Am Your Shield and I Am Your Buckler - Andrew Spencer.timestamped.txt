[0:24] [Music]
[0:25] when i was a game warden in indiana for
[0:27] seven years
[0:29] i used to come to a certain spring
[0:32] when i would go hunting
[0:33] [Music]
[0:36] and i looked at that old spring and i
[0:37] said spring you're the happiest spring
[0:40] i've ever seen
[0:41] you're just a bubbling all the time oh
[0:44] it was good water
[0:46] it kept fresh all the time because it
[0:48] bubbled from way
[0:50] down in the ground and it kept all the
[0:53] stagnant parts puddled away
[0:56] that's a good thing just keep bubbling
[1:06] so i sat down one day to talk to this
[1:08] spring
[1:10] and i said mr springs why are you so
[1:12] happy
[1:14] and if he could have spoke back to me he
[1:15] said uh brother branham
[1:18] i'm always happy well i'd say what makes
[1:22] you
[1:22] bubble maybe it's because the deer
[1:24] drinks from me once in a while he'd say
[1:26] no
[1:28] i'd say maybe it's because a bear drinks
[1:30] from you no
[1:32] well maybe what makes you bubble is
[1:34] because you know that
[1:36] each year i come by here and drink from
[1:38] you myself no
[1:41] i said well what makes you bubble you
[1:43] say brother branham
[1:45] it is the knee bubbling it's something
[1:47] behind me pushing me
[1:49] and making me bubble that's the way a
[1:53] man is
[1:54] when he takes god into his heart that's
[1:56] something that

[38:41] [Music]
[38:43] he's worthy of it all he's a god that we
[38:46] know that can
[38:48] heal to the uttermost and as brother
[38:51] matthew said we want to be remembering
[38:53] brother john kelly
[38:56] a real faithful member here at full
[38:58] gospel lighthouse a senior deacon here
[39:01] at the church and
[39:02] he's been a faithful faithful servant of
[39:05] christ throughout the years
[39:07] so we want to be remembering him the
[39:10] doctors are saying that there's nothing
[39:12] else they can do for him and they plan
[39:14] to take him off the ventilator tomorrow
[39:17] monday morning so we know that this is a
[39:20] perfect chance for god to show up and
[39:23] show out and we know that if it's
[39:26] god's time to take brother john there's
[39:28] not a doctor
[39:30] on earth that can that can keep him here
[39:33] and if it's god's time to let him stay
[39:36] here there's
[39:38] there's no devil that can that can come
[39:40] with death
[39:41] and take him away so we know that this
[39:44] is a very troublesome time for the
[39:45] family
[39:46] the kelley family the bayleys everybody
[39:49] that is connected to the kelly family
[39:51] there we
[39:52] are certainly praying for every
[39:54] individual brother larry
[39:56] i've been in constant prayer for him and
[39:59] i know how hard this could be on him
[40:02] understanding
[40:04] the the value of fatherhood
[40:07] and so we just want to be remembering
[40:09] brother larry he's such a dear friend to
[40:11] myself and
[40:12] i love him with all of our hearts and i
[40:13] know that everyone here full gospel
[40:15] lighthouse extends that
[40:17] that love to brother larry sister joanne
[40:19] sister savannah
[40:21] the whole family sister even sister
[40:22] tammy sister linda we're just praying
[40:24] for them
[40:26] and knowing knowing that we serve a god
[40:29] now it's time for us to watch what god
[40:31] will do
[40:33] amen i'll let you have your seats this
[40:36] morning
[40:37] just to make a quick announcement to
[40:39] everyone here
[40:40] and to those on the internet we so thank
[40:43] you for being a part of these services
[40:44] the past couple weekends and
[40:46] and uh bearing with us during this time
[40:49] i know it's been difficult for
[40:51] for many of you as we all love to be in
[40:53] the house of god to worship
[40:55] lord the lord jesus christ in one accord
[40:58] and it's been difficult on us as your
[41:00] pastors to
[41:02] to to do these things because we whole
[41:04] lot rather preach to you
[41:06] as a congregation sitting here in body
[41:08] than to sit here and
[41:10] with empty pews that are that are that
[41:12] we look to see you fill
[41:14] in but this is how we have felt to go
[41:17] forward and to and to speak to you in
[41:19] this manner to keep you safe
[41:21] and i believe that i believe that if we
[41:24] have saved one from getting this
[41:26] sickness we've done our job
[41:28] and so we we know that we've been
[41:30] criticized for how we've handled things
[41:32] we know that we'll be criticized how we
[41:34] move forward
[41:35] but that's okay criticism comes with the
[41:37] job and so we
[41:39] we know that we're just doing what the
[41:41] lord is leading us to do and is what is
[41:43] best for you
[41:44] as as as we see to take care of you in
[41:47] this
[41:48] manner so we so we have dealt with this
[41:51] and prayed about it many times and so
[41:54] we've waited
[41:54] until until we've had no cases for the
[41:57] last couple weeks
[41:59] and so lord willing next saturday
[42:02] we will have an in-person service
[42:05] for half of our congregation and so we'd
[42:08] like to ask
[42:09] we'd like to ask all of those that that
[42:11] we had sitting on the fraser side on the
[42:13] left-hand side as you enter in
[42:16] all of those that are that were sitting
[42:18] on this side on the left hand side
[42:20] which would be my right hand side but
[42:22] your left hand side as you enter in to
[42:24] come on saturday night at seven o'clock
[42:26] and then we would like to invite those
[42:29] that were sitting on the right hand side
[42:30] as you enter
[42:31] to come on sunday morning at 11 o'clock
[42:34] and
[42:35] so we so we're asking for for half and
[42:38] half here and you'll you'll remember
[42:39] where you are i know that
[42:41] i know that you'll remember where you
[42:43] were sitting at before all this
[42:44] it's not been that long so just uh just
[42:47] come
[42:48] and so we we invite you to come but yet
[42:51] we're not pressuring you to come
[42:52] and if you feel um anxious or
[42:56] shook up about coming we we know we're
[42:58] not pressuring you to come but we want
[42:59] to open the house of the lord so that
[43:02] so that you can come and have the
[43:04] opportunity
[43:05] to worship the lord in the house of the
[43:07] lord where god ordained us to be at here
[43:09] on earth to worship him
[43:11] so we open that up to you those that
[43:13] were sitting on the fraser side
[43:15] uh and on the left-hand side as you
[43:17] enter if you could come on saturday
[43:19] night
[43:20] at seven and those that were sitting on
[43:21] the right-hand side
[43:23] at 11 on sunday you can wear your mask
[43:26] if you choose to do so throughout the
[43:28] whole service we will not
[43:30] well we will not demand you to do that
[43:32] not even the cdc room
[43:34] recommends that or or they demand that
[43:37] but we're just
[43:38] offering that to you you can keep your
[43:39] mask on the whole time if it makes you
[43:41] feel comfortable
[43:42] you do so in that manner and so we won't
[43:45] be just so you know
[43:47] what we're doing we won't be having
[43:48] special services or
[43:50] special singing uh while we're here in
[43:52] church that way we're not handing off
[43:54] the microphones and different things and
[43:56] and transferring so we'll just let the
[43:58] musicians
[43:59] and the song leaders to do the leading
[44:01] of songs and specials
[44:03] just for a certain time we don't i hope
[44:05] you don't get tired of our singing
[44:07] and if you do you'll just have to get
[44:09] used to it and
[44:10] uh it's the best we got right now
[44:14] and so uh so we just we just want to
[44:17] present these things to you
[44:19] but also you know know for shortly that
[44:22] i'm not pressuring you to come
[44:23] the health department i've been in
[44:25] contact with them thank you for whoever
[44:27] give them my name or number but i've
[44:29] been in contact with them and
[44:31] they've been happy with the way we've
[44:33] dealt and handled everything that we've
[44:35] that we've went through and so so now
[44:38] we're moving forward
[44:39] this is the place that i believe that
[44:41] sons and daughters of god long to be in
[44:44] and and so we we know that we haven't
[44:47] had any cases for the past 14 days
[44:50] so we're just we're attentively planning
[44:52] to open up service
[44:54] next saturday night and so if you choose
[44:57] if you're sitting on this side you you
[44:59] feel welcome to come we'll be here we're
[45:01] going to preach to you
[45:02] the word of the lord now we don't fear
[45:04] this thing
[45:06] uh but we're not stupid about it either
[45:08] we're we don't
[45:09] we don't fear it but we're very cautious
[45:11] and uh so we
[45:13] we just don't want to tempt the temp the
[45:15] enemy to come and say that we're too
[45:17] proud or we're too big to get this thing
[45:19] because i know what he'll do
[45:21] and so we just we're thankful that uh
[45:24] the people that have
[45:25] that have contracted this disease
[45:28] have either gotten better or or or god
[45:31] has moved on the scene for them
[45:33] but we don't want to spread this any
[45:35] further to you
[45:37] as the people and so as again no
[45:40] pressure to come
[45:41] but if you're going to go to walmart and
[45:43] go to everywhere else i think you can
[45:44] come to the house of the lord and
[45:46] again i'm not pressuring you to do
[45:48] anything don't don't say the brother
[45:50] andrews holding a knife to my neck
[45:52] saying i got to get to the house of the
[45:54] lord or i won't be saved i'm not doing
[45:55] those things
[45:56] but don't use covet as an excuse not to
[45:59] serve the lord
[46:00] i believe that as the prophet would say
[46:02] that every time the doors open that's
[46:04] where a christian they long to be in the
[46:06] house of the lord and
[46:07] i know you haven't been able to come
[46:09] because i haven't allowed you to be able
[46:10] to come but
[46:11] so so you've got you've got me to blame
[46:13] for the past couple weekends and if if
[46:15] you
[46:17] if if you've been there you know you can
[46:20] blame it on me
[46:21] yeah you know so now we're giving you a
[46:23] chance to get right back with god again
[46:25] if it's that's been your case she lost
[46:26] god for the last couple
[46:28] weeks we've given you a chance to find
[46:29] him again so
[46:31] so next week intentively if we if we
[46:34] decide to go anyway
[46:35] different we will let you know by the
[46:37] church text message system and facebook
[46:40] so just be in prayer for us that we get
[46:42] no new cases and we can come back and
[46:44] we hope not to do this very long um
[46:47] so so so everybody i know the big
[46:50] question is well i want the opportunity
[46:52] to be
[46:53] here when brother ron's speaking well
[46:55] we're going to give you that opportunity
[46:58] so brother ron and myself we will
[47:00] alternate to make sure everybody gets a
[47:02] fair chance so that they can hear their
[47:04] pastor i longed to hear him as well

[47:08] both services both weekends both nights

[51:19] of genesis chapter 15
[51:21] and verse 1.
[51:26] amen genesis chapter 15 and verse 1 and
[51:29] we like to
[51:31] speak some things that are upon our
[51:34] heart this morning
[51:36] and i don't know exactly how long i'll
[51:38] be short or long
[51:39] but i just want to give the lord
[51:41] opportunity to speak this morning some
[51:43] things that he has spoken directly to
[51:45] myself and
[51:47] and i feel like they're directly to you
[51:49] as as god's people so we
[51:52] just want to take this scripture this
[51:53] morning
[51:55] genesis chapter 15 and verse 1 but
[51:57] before we read let's speak to the author
[51:59] of the word
[52:01] father we come to you this morning lord
[52:03] your servants lord we've come into the
[52:05] house of god
[52:06] lord we as your people that are sitting
[52:09] and listening by the way of the internet
[52:11] this morning have made their
[52:12] house a tabernacle where a sanctuary
[52:16] that you could come down and
[52:18] fill their living room feel where
[52:20] they're at lord jesus
[52:21] fill the kitchen fill the car lord and
[52:24] you could come and speak to them lip to
[52:26] ear lord and make yourself known to them
[52:28] like never before
[52:30] lord i pray today that as the word would
[52:32] go forth that you would be high and
[52:34] lifted up
[52:35] i pray that you would speak to us your
[52:37] children lord you see the things that
[52:40] that we have need of and body the things
[52:42] that we have need of in spirit lord
[52:44] and lord even lord even into the realms
[52:47] of our soul father we pray that you
[52:49] would
[52:50] reach into the uttermost with the holy
[52:52] spirit and begin to
[52:54] begin to knock on our hearts door and
[52:56] may we open up our heart lord and let
[52:59] jesus
[52:59] on in father lord we pray that you would
[53:02] be merciful to your children lord i
[53:05] our precious brother john kelly lord
[53:07] that's in a very
[53:08] dire situation lord we know that
[53:10] nothing's too hard for you lord jesus
[53:13] and
[53:13] we know god that that it takes as much
[53:16] faith to let him go
[53:17] into that realm as much faith as it does
[53:19] for you to raise him up lord to believe
[53:22] so father we stand here in faith this
[53:24] morning that you're going to work
[53:26] everything out according to your perfect
[53:28] will
[53:29] lord i pray that you would use my lips
[53:31] speak to your
[53:32] children today lord in the name of jesus
[53:35] christ we pray these things
[53:37] amen and amen genesis chapter 15
[53:40] to verse 1 the bible says that after
[53:44] these things
[53:45] the word of the lord came unto abram
[53:50] in a vision saying fear not abram i
[53:53] am thy shield and thy exceeding
[53:56] great reward may god bless his word you
[53:59] may be seated in the presence of the
[54:01] lord
[54:02] after these things the word of the lord
[54:04] came unto abram now if you
[54:06] if you're a very very scholared bible
[54:10] reader and read over these things you
[54:11] you'll realize that this is the very
[54:13] first time
[54:14] in the scriptures where we see that the
[54:17] word of the lord
[54:18] came and and many times we see how the
[54:21] word would come
[54:22] and we realized that jesus is the word
[54:25] that john 1 1 would tell us that in the
[54:28] beginning was the word and
[54:30] the word was with god and the word was
[54:32] god and
[54:33] and here we see as as abram is in a
[54:36] vision as
[54:37] as god brings him into that realm of
[54:39] vision and begins to speak to him in
[54:42] that vision
[54:43] and he says to him fear not abram i am
[54:46] thy shield and thy exceeding great
[54:49] reward
[54:50] and before i go into our topic today
[54:53] i would like to just just make a few
[54:56] comments
[54:57] on on last weekend's service and and
[55:01] those that were here in the congregation
[55:03] could testify to these things that
[55:05] that that last week in service was one
[55:07] of the most powerful
[55:09] atmospheres that that we've ever set in
[55:11] as a people
[55:13] and personally myself i felt like from
[55:16] the very
[55:16] beginning that that god was god was
[55:19] doing
[55:20] some very special things now we know
[55:22] that when his children come together to
[55:24] worship him that
[55:25] that god is there because god inhabits
[55:27] the praises of his people
[55:29] but yet last weekend it was such a it
[55:32] was such an atmosphere that was
[55:33] already that was already there the
[55:36] people of god
[55:36] and the children of god and your prayers
[55:38] that went forth
[55:40] had set an atmosphere in this place
[55:42] where god
[55:44] felt very welcome to come and yet we
[55:47] were sitting here and the church was
[55:49] basically empty
[55:50] but yet it was full in a complete
[55:53] different sense of things
[55:54] and yet when when when we were going
[55:57] through those things brother brother
[55:58] alden and myself we've related these
[56:00] things we've went over these things and
[56:02] listened to that service
[56:03] over and over again this week just
[56:05] listening to key words and things that
[56:07] were spoken
[56:08] by the man of god and we realized that
[56:11] that that the man of god is a servant of
[56:13] the lord and
[56:14] and that god speaks through man and and
[56:16] as we were there we were just listening
[56:18] and it was
[56:19] it was like elohim himself was speaking
[56:22] lift to ear to his children
[56:24] and when when brother ron he when i was
[56:27] called up on stage and i want you to
[56:29] notice some of these statements
[56:30] that when i was pulled up on stage
[56:34] that that that that was more than
[56:36] brother ron that was standing there
[56:38] but that that to me was elohim
[56:41] ever so close and when i'm not trying to
[56:44] take anything or
[56:46] or necessarily to steal anything from
[56:48] brother ron's service
[56:49] but yet i believe that if if we are real
[56:52] servants of christ that we're inspired
[56:55] by the man of god we're inspired by the
[56:57] word of god
[56:58] and so from last week in service i want
[57:01] to speak to you
[57:02] on these things that i am your shield
[57:05] and i am your buckler
[57:07] but you remember that that now i want
[57:09] you to notice this and i don't want you
[57:10] to necessarily see me but i want you to
[57:13] see yourself in this
[57:14] but as i was pulled up on the stage as
[57:17] it were
[57:18] that the very first words that were
[57:20] spoken was
[57:21] abram i am thy shield and i
[57:24] am thy buckler now i'm sitting in this
[57:28] atmosphere last weekend and
[57:30] i'm sitting there and i just began to
[57:32] speak the things of god
[57:33] i began to speak to god saying lord
[57:36] would you reveal the secrets of my heart
[57:38] would you speak
[57:39] live to hear to me today and many times
[57:42] when i'm saying those things
[57:44] as a leader of this church i am asking
[57:46] for a word
[57:47] of the lord to come to myself so that i
[57:49] can speak it to you
[57:51] but notice as soon as i was pulled on
[57:53] stage
[57:54] he says i am thy shield and i am
[57:57] the buckler now that evening about six
[58:00] eight o'clock we got a phone call at our
[58:03] house
[58:04] house there that evening and and a
[58:06] sister that lives hundreds of miles away
[58:08] from here
[58:09] she calls up sister katie and she begins
[58:12] to tell her these things
[58:14] and she said she had just come to a spot
[58:17] of relaxation for the day
[58:19] and going through the day's events and
[58:21] she was just sitting down
[58:22] in in her in her place there and she had
[58:25] been reading some things
[58:26] and she said all of a sudden there began
[58:29] to be
[58:29] an amber of light come in the room and
[58:31] it began to whirl in the room
[58:34] and this this this lady is a very
[58:36] spiritual lady a voice that i trust
[58:38] and i've seen the things that she's
[58:40] spoken that become
[58:42] true and i i've watched those things so
[58:44] i i trust the voice but i want you to
[58:46] notice these things
[58:48] that that these things are are to us as
[58:51] his children
[58:52] and here the amber of light comes into
[58:54] the room and begins to whirl
[58:56] in that room and all of a sudden the
[58:59] lord begins to speak to her
[59:01] and tells her says next time you speak
[59:04] with katie spencer
[59:06] you say to her tell brother andrew that
[59:09] i
[59:09] am thy shield and i am thy buckley
[59:14] now you don't know what that done to me
[59:16] in that moment when i'm sitting there
[59:17] when i know what was spoken early that
[59:20] morning
[59:20] and then i watched when god speaks the
[59:22] same thing that night
[59:24] as i watch him say to us that i am
[59:27] thy shield and i am that buckler
[59:30] he wasn't necessarily just speaking to
[59:32] me yet i believe he was speaking to me
[59:34] but i believe with all of my heart is
[59:36] standing there saying god i want you to
[59:38] speak to me
[59:39] something a word to the church and he is
[59:42] saying to a people of god that's been
[59:44] called by his name
[59:46] that i am thy shield and i am thy
[59:48] buckler
[59:49] that i am your defense that i am your
[59:52] everything
[59:53] that i am your front and i am your back
[59:55] i've got you
[59:56] in the front i am your real reward i am
[59:59] everything to you
[1:00:00] that though you may have been through
[1:00:02] some stuff you went through covet and
[1:00:04] you did well
[1:00:05] i was just shield through that you went
[1:00:08] through cancer and i was a shield
[1:00:10] you went through turmoil and i was your
[1:00:12] shield you went through fear and i was a
[1:00:14] shield
[1:00:14] you went through a baby loss and i was
[1:00:17] healed you went through sickness and i
[1:00:19] was
[1:00:19] healed he is saying to a people of god
[1:00:22] that i
[1:00:23] am your protection and if you are behind
[1:00:26] me
[1:00:27] there is nothing that can get to you
[1:00:31] hallelujah but notice in the scripture
[1:00:35] that that the scripture in genesis
[1:00:37] chapter 15
[1:00:38] that that the bible as it begins to open
[1:00:41] up it says
[1:00:42] after these things the word of the lord
[1:00:45] came now notice
[1:00:46] if you go back and read genesis chapter
[1:00:48] 14
[1:00:49] you'll see what takes place there when
[1:00:51] you see the battle
[1:00:53] with the kings they are the four kings
[1:00:55] and and how that
[1:00:56] abram goes out and he he completely goes
[1:00:59] out in self-denial of himself and
[1:01:02] self-denial of his 318 male servants
[1:01:05] he puts his own neck on on the line for
[1:01:08] his
[1:01:09] for his own kin one that will in the
[1:01:12] future will separate himself
[1:01:14] he's separating himself and notice the
[1:01:17] self-denial of abram
[1:01:18] that notice the victory and you notice
[1:01:21] the blessing of melchizedek
[1:01:23] in genesis chapter 14 that after the
[1:01:27] battle
[1:01:27] with the kings that this is when the
[1:01:30] king shows up and abram begins to pay
[1:01:34] tithes and the levites begin to pray
[1:01:37] ties to their
[1:01:38] father abraham and he begins to speak to
[1:01:40] him and brother branham grabs
[1:01:42] this genesis chapter 15 on on the wings
[1:01:45] of a snow white dove and he reads this
[1:01:47] scripture
[1:01:48] and he's grabbing from down in verse 4
[1:01:50] and 5 and six
[1:01:51] but he when he reads over genesis
[1:01:53] chapter one
[1:01:54] he says i am thy shield and i
[1:01:58] am the buckler he said he is jehovah
[1:02:00] nessie
[1:02:01] that he is your victory and here abram
[1:02:05] is setting in this
[1:02:06] prophetic realm of vision and we realize
[1:02:09] what that vision is we as a people of
[1:02:12] god
[1:02:12] understand the vision and under able
[1:02:14] under the
[1:02:15] age that we're living in we understand
[1:02:17] the visions of god
[1:02:18] like like people have never understood
[1:02:21] before but we realize that abram being a
[1:02:23] prophet he was able to look in that
[1:02:25] prophetic realm
[1:02:26] and begin to see that the word of the
[1:02:28] lord came to him in that hour
[1:02:30] and if he says something in that vision
[1:02:33] we know that those visions never fail
[1:02:36] we know that those visions never fail
[1:02:39] and here he is speaking to abram
[1:02:41] but he's not just speaking to abram he's
[1:02:43] speaking to his seed
[1:02:45] and he's saying to his seed that i am
[1:02:48] thy shield
[1:02:49] and i am thy buckler brother branham
[1:02:51] would say now the vision don't heal you
[1:02:54] the vision lets you know that the elohim
[1:02:57] that god almighty is very present
[1:03:01] and if you could realize that we were
[1:03:03] sitting in a vision last weekend
[1:03:05] and now we're sitting in a vision in
[1:03:07] this service today
[1:03:09] and he's saying to the people of god and
[1:03:11] if you could only realize what is
[1:03:13] happening in this service
[1:03:15] and then around the world that the
[1:03:16] people that will listen to this
[1:03:18] colleges that are listening to this
[1:03:20] there are mighty
[1:03:21] powerful people in hollywood that listen
[1:03:24] to this
[1:03:25] and they're saying that god is saying to
[1:03:27] a people
[1:03:28] that i am thy shield and i am thy
[1:03:31] buckler
[1:03:32] he's not just saying that that that that
[1:03:35] was just to abraham in the natural
[1:03:37] that was abraham in the spiritual and
[1:03:40] the bible said that
[1:03:41] if ye are christ then are you abraham's
[1:03:45] seed
[1:03:48] the vision lets you know that he's close
[1:03:50] you remember when brother brandon was
[1:03:52] sitting there
[1:03:53] and he was he was dealing with a case
[1:03:55] and he's trying to get a prayer line in
[1:03:56] order
[1:03:57] and everything they have to go through
[1:03:58] the cards and everything has to be just
[1:04:00] right
[1:04:01] because people just get out of order but
[1:04:03] there was there was a there was a
[1:04:05] there was a black lady that was there in
[1:04:07] the back and she began to
[1:04:08] bust through the ushers and break
[1:04:10] through the ushers and come down there
[1:04:12] and scream and
[1:04:13] brother branham heal my child heal my
[1:04:15] baby heal my child
[1:04:17] and brother branham has to conduct the
[1:04:19] order and get things back in line
[1:04:21] and he says now i can't i can't do
[1:04:23] nothing for you sister i believe that
[1:04:25] your baby can be healed but i i don't i
[1:04:28] can't say anything
[1:04:30] until he shows me and so they begin to
[1:04:32] get the prayer line back in order
[1:04:34] and all of a sudden brother madam said i
[1:04:36] began to see a road
[1:04:38] come out in front of me and he said i
[1:04:39] watched that vision as it came out
[1:04:41] and he said there was that little girl
[1:04:44] that had been paralyzed when that doctor
[1:04:46] was working on her and operating on her
[1:04:49] tonsils
[1:04:49] he said there was that little girl that
[1:04:52] had been paralyzed for two years
[1:04:54] from her shoulder down that little girl
[1:04:56] was walking down that road
[1:04:58] and she was bouncing and had a little
[1:05:00] baby doll in her heart
[1:05:02] and she was just patting that little
[1:05:03] baby as she was walking down through
[1:05:05] there
[1:05:06] and the servant of the lord turned to
[1:05:07] her and says honey your baby's gonna be
[1:05:10] well
[1:05:11] and she says when will it be he said
[1:05:14] right now she's well
[1:05:15] and the brother and brother branham said
[1:05:18] there wasn't enough devils in hell
[1:05:20] that satan couldn't send enough devils
[1:05:22] out of hell
[1:05:23] that could stop that vision because god
[1:05:26] had already said so
[1:05:28] and that little baby at that moment
[1:05:31] stood up and started screaming
[1:05:33] and praising the lord said mother i'm
[1:05:36] healed
[1:05:37] people started fainting around them why
[1:05:39] because the vision had spoke
[1:05:43] oh church of the living god the vision
[1:05:46] has spoke things about you
[1:05:48] that are there in eternity that are
[1:05:50] waiting for this temporal body to catch
[1:05:52] up with
[1:05:53] and you will walk right into that spot
[1:05:55] of eternity
[1:05:58] whoo there are things that are holding
[1:06:00] that are holding there just for the
[1:06:02] moment
[1:06:03] and when it comes to pass it will create
[1:06:06] such a catas music event
[1:06:09] that all hell will be shook down
[1:06:13] hallelujah hallelujah you look down in
[1:06:18] genesis chapter 15 when abram begins to
[1:06:21] speak to the lord notice
[1:06:23] he's still in the vision he's still in
[1:06:26] the vision and he begins to say to him
[1:06:29] you see that i go childless you see i
[1:06:32] don't have this child you see that
[1:06:34] i don't have an heir and he begins to
[1:06:36] speak to him the only air that i have is
[1:06:38] eliezer
[1:06:39] the pre the elies are of the the eldest
[1:06:43] the eldest servant is he my heir
[1:06:46] and god begins to speak to him and the
[1:06:48] word of the lord came to him and says
[1:06:50] this will not be your heir but out of
[1:06:53] your own loins
[1:06:55] out of your own loins will come forth as
[1:06:57] heat
[1:06:58] and then god takes him in the vision
[1:07:01] and he tells him he takes him out and he
[1:07:04] says you see the stars up there
[1:07:06] can you number them can you call them by
[1:07:09] their name
[1:07:10] do you know how many is up there and he
[1:07:12] begins to tell a man they ain't got a
[1:07:14] child
[1:07:15] god he's telling a man a vision that he
[1:07:18] knows down on earth
[1:07:20] that he ain't got a child that he could
[1:07:22] pass on his lineage to
[1:07:24] but he begins to tell him you look a
[1:07:25] pair of them stars
[1:07:27] that's going to be your seed what was he
[1:07:30] looking at
[1:07:30] church he was looking at you
[1:07:33] i believe that abram when he was looking
[1:07:36] at those stars
[1:07:37] was seeing me right down here in
[1:07:39] laodicea
[1:07:40] and he was realizing that god was saying
[1:07:43] to his children
[1:07:44] all the way down in laodicea that i am
[1:07:47] my shield
[1:07:48] and i am my buckler you're going to go
[1:07:51] through some stuff but i'm going to
[1:07:52] bring you out stronger oh
[1:07:56] hallelujah you see god was abram's
[1:07:59] portion
[1:08:01] and so is he the portion of every
[1:08:02] righteous soul
[1:08:04] i am your constant covering i am your
[1:08:07] protector
[1:08:08] and i am your great and exceeding great
[1:08:11] reward
[1:08:13] it was not a land it was not canaan that
[1:08:16] was the promise but it was salvation to
[1:08:18] come
[1:08:19] through that promised seed that his word
[1:08:22] would be
[1:08:23] abram's strength brother branham said
[1:08:27] he said if god is your shield how is the
[1:08:31] devil going to hit you
[1:08:35] hallelujah if god is your shield how
[1:08:39] how in the world is the devil ever going
[1:08:41] to hit you
[1:08:43] he is your great and exceeding great
[1:08:45] reward
[1:08:46] he's helped to the helpless he's hoped
[1:08:49] to the hopeless
[1:08:50] he's a friend to the friendless he's
[1:08:52] health to the sick
[1:08:54] he's strength to the weak he's power to
[1:08:57] the powerless
[1:08:58] he's life to the lifeless he's god if
[1:09:01] you serve him
[1:09:02] he's god if you don't when your barrel
[1:09:04] is empty he's your meal

[1:09:07] comfort
[1:09:09] hallelujah when you're going through
[1:09:11] some stuff he's your everything

[1:09:21] has he been a doctor has he been a
[1:09:24] lawyer
[1:09:24] has he been a shield has he been a
[1:09:27] buckler
[1:09:27] has he been in defense for you i say
[1:09:30] it's jesus in the morning

[1:09:48] children
[1:09:49] as many as the lord our god shall call
[1:09:51] that i
[1:09:52] am my shield
[1:09:56] hallelujah what we need today is a good
[1:09:58] old-fashioned sky blue sin
[1:10:00] killing religion sweeping this country
[1:10:03] in an old time
[1:10:04] saint paul's revival and the baptism of
[1:10:07] the holy ghost
[1:10:08] back in the church again that's the best
[1:10:11] defense
[1:10:12] better than any atom bomb was ever
[1:10:15] created
[1:10:16] you notice what was spoke to you and
[1:10:19] again i'm not trying to infringe on
[1:10:21] brother ron sermon but i
[1:10:22] am inspired if you weren't inspired by
[1:10:25] last weekend go back and listen
[1:10:27] until you get inspired but i heard
[1:10:30] somebody from another world say
[1:10:32] do you know who you are do you know who
[1:10:35] i
[1:10:35] am do you know that i've called you by
[1:10:38] your name
[1:10:39] who are you who
[1:10:42] are you are you a son of god are you a
[1:10:46] daughter of god
[1:10:47] that's the best defense that the world
[1:10:50] has ever known
[1:10:53] it's a church full of power a church
[1:10:55] full of authority
[1:10:56] a church that is called by his name that
[1:10:59] will not be stripped
[1:11:01] that will not be whipped a church that
[1:11:04] has
[1:11:04] all access and authority in the name of
[1:11:07] jesus christ
[1:11:09] and the word of god will whip satan
[1:11:11] anytime any place under any circumstance
[1:11:16] i want you to know i don't know how you
[1:11:17] feel at your home this morning
[1:11:19] but this church feels like it's ten
[1:11:21] thousand angels
[1:11:23] that are sitting here in this place
[1:11:26] the holy ghost is the best defense
[1:11:29] that the world has ever known of paul
[1:11:32] would say it like this
[1:11:34] i am crucified with christ hallelujah i
[1:11:38] am crucified with christ
[1:11:40] and the life that i now live not the
[1:11:43] life that i once knew sure i was a
[1:11:45] scholar
[1:11:45] sure i wasn't know it all sure i knew
[1:11:48] everything there was about god of the
[1:11:50] old testament
[1:11:50] but i didn't know anything about the god
[1:11:52] of the new testament
[1:11:54] but when i met that pillar of fire i
[1:11:56] knew that the god of the old testament
[1:11:58] was jesus christ of the new and i begin
[1:12:01] to realize
[1:12:03] that the life that i now live will put
[1:12:06] me
[1:12:07] will put me into a grave maybe the life
[1:12:10] that i now live i may go by the way of
[1:12:12] the grave
[1:12:13] but the life that i now live will get me
[1:12:15] out of the grave
[1:12:18] that the message that i preach in this
[1:12:20] day that there will be a people
[1:12:23] in the last day will believe what paul
[1:12:25] preached
[1:12:26] believe what peter preached the life
[1:12:28] that paul was now
[1:12:30] living
[1:12:35] hallelujah i can tell you about the life
[1:12:36] that i used to live
[1:12:38] and the life that i used to live gave me
[1:12:40] a whole lot more age
[1:12:41] than what i should have got there's a
[1:12:44] whole lot more aches and pains in my
[1:12:46] body
[1:12:46] because of the life that i used to live
[1:12:49] but if i could go to telling you about
[1:12:50] the life that i now live
[1:12:53] i tell you about how a god can take away
[1:12:55] your aches and pains
[1:12:57] i tell you about a god that'll heal your
[1:12:59] blind eyes i tell you about a god that
[1:13:01] can heal you to the uttermost
[1:13:03] i'll tell you about a god the life that
[1:13:05] i now live
[1:13:07] the life that i now live will put me in
[1:13:09] a body change
[1:13:11] the life that i now live will save the
[1:13:13] prodigals that i
[1:13:14] prayed for the life that i now live
[1:13:20] i am my shield
[1:13:23] and thy buckler call
[1:13:27] i am thy shield and thy buckler john
[1:13:29] when you're there
[1:13:31] when you're there on the isle of patmos
[1:13:33] and things ain't looking good
[1:13:35] i am my shield and i am thy buckler
[1:13:38] you see there's a lot of people that get
[1:13:40] the wrong idea or their own
[1:13:42] concept on god being your sealed they
[1:13:45] think that if god is your shield
[1:13:47] that you're not going to go through
[1:13:48] anything hallelujah if you go back to
[1:13:52] look
[1:13:53] at abram's life from genesis chapter 15
[1:13:56] all the way to genesis chapter 22
[1:13:58] there's some stuff
[1:13:59] that happens to abram are you with me
[1:14:02] there's some stuff that happens to
[1:14:03] abraham
[1:14:04] that that that god was not promising him
[1:14:07] everything in the materialistic realm
[1:14:09] everything's going to be okay i'm going
[1:14:11] to give you everything asked for
[1:14:13] but abram went through lies abram went
[1:14:16] through turmoil
[1:14:17] abram went through separation abram went
[1:14:19] through abraham went through
[1:14:21] old age sarah went through trials every
[1:14:24] month
[1:14:25] but he was not telling him
[1:14:28] that i am your shield and i'm going to
[1:14:30] keep you from everything
[1:14:32] but he is telling him that i am for you
[1:14:35] and that there's nothing going to happen
[1:14:38] to you
[1:14:38] unless i permit it
[1:14:44] we'll say well he's my shield today but
[1:14:47] yet my family member got coveted
[1:14:49] he still you're sealed he's still your
[1:14:52] buckler
[1:14:53] there's not one hair on your head that's
[1:14:56] falling off
[1:14:57] unless god knows where it's at brother
[1:15:00] branham would say i ain't lost one of
[1:15:02] them sister me
[1:15:03] she says pray tell me where they are he
[1:15:06] says where were they before the
[1:15:08] foundation of the world

[1:15:27] a word person
[1:15:28] i can say i am a word being i am a
[1:15:31] spiritual gene of god
[1:15:33] that i came here to give light to the
[1:15:36] word

[1:15:39] i am packing the very image of god
[1:15:42] the life that i now live i am preaching
[1:15:45] to a people
[1:15:46] that believe what the bible is all about
[1:15:49] the life that i now live
[1:15:54] i don't believe that it should be just
[1:15:55] for paul to be able to say those things
[1:15:58] that paul would say the life that i now
[1:16:00] live or i pack the image of god that we
[1:16:02] are the images of christ

[1:16:07] you may be scared
[1:16:09] yes you may be going through turmoil yes
[1:16:11] you may be in fear yes you may be in all
[1:16:13] kinds of circumstances
[1:16:15] but do not forget who you are
[1:16:18] i am a word being i am a gene sheet of
[1:16:22] god
[1:16:23] in my body i am packing the very image
[1:16:26] of christ
[1:16:27] i came at this time to give light to the
[1:16:30] manifested word of this day
[1:16:32] and there won't be no devil that stops
[1:16:35] this bride
[1:16:37] satan has tried to stop church satan has
[1:16:39] tried to stop you praying
[1:16:41] satan has tried his very worst to keep
[1:16:43] you from believing in almighty god but
[1:16:46] god has allowed circumstance
[1:16:48] to bring you into a crisis of belief
[1:16:57] hallelujah
[1:17:01] notice in the rising of the sun he said
[1:17:04] he said no more could the botany life
[1:17:06] live back there
[1:17:07] at the beginning without the sun to
[1:17:09] bring it to life no more
[1:17:11] than today when sons of god is upon the
[1:17:13] earth
[1:17:14] it takes the s-o-n light to bring them
[1:17:16] to eternal life
[1:17:18] his chosen ones that he knew before the
[1:17:20] foundation of the world
[1:17:22] he had chosen them in himself before the
[1:17:24] foundation of the world
[1:17:26] and on easter morning then in this dirt
[1:17:29] somewhere laid our bodies at that time
[1:17:33] catch me in this dirt somewhere laid
[1:17:36] our bodies at that time for we are the
[1:17:39] dust of the earth and in heaven there
[1:17:41] was a book of memory
[1:17:43] and his attributes was in him knowing
[1:17:45] that because
[1:17:46] this son of god raised it would also
[1:17:48] raise a life
[1:17:49] every son that was foreordained to this
[1:17:53] great time
[1:17:55] the church ages had all the mechanics
[1:17:57] down they had everything in order they
[1:17:59] could tell you how to do this
[1:18:00] even pentecost come up to it and they
[1:18:03] were that
[1:18:04] close they had all the mechanics right
[1:18:06] but they didn't have the dynamics
[1:18:09] they didn't have the spark to get that
[1:18:11] cadillac on the road
[1:18:13] but there's a people on earth today that
[1:18:16] is completely in the car and ready to
[1:18:19] take off
[1:18:20] this thing's going to go faster than a
[1:18:22] rocket this thing's going to go faster
[1:18:25] than the
[1:18:25] neil armstrong ever went up there when
[1:18:28] we change our bodies
[1:18:29] it's going to be in a moment in a
[1:18:31] twinkling of an eye
[1:18:34] before you can ever blat your back your
[1:18:36] eyes brother gabriel
[1:18:37] we're out of here oh
[1:18:40] figure that one out science
[1:18:44] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:18:52] hallelujah hallelujah he is our defense
[1:18:57] he is our strength and paul would say
[1:19:01] when we would grab over in ephesians
[1:19:03] chapter 6 and 16 and we can look at the
[1:19:06] spiritual weaponry of a christian
[1:19:08] but verse 16 paul says above all
[1:19:11] taking the shield of faith wherewith ye
[1:19:14] shall be able to quench all the fiery
[1:19:16] darts of the wicked
[1:19:18] so we we see here that not only
[1:19:22] not maybe you will be able to quench the
[1:19:24] fire guards
[1:19:26] but he says wherewith ye shall be able
[1:19:29] to quench all the fiery darts of the
[1:19:31] wicked
[1:19:32] now now we all know what a shield is but
[1:19:35] a buckler
[1:19:36] a buckler is basically a double shield
[1:19:39] it's a round shield with a grip
[1:19:41] and history would say that a shield was
[1:19:43] held with one hand
[1:19:45] but a a a buckler was had a place where
[1:19:48] you would stick both
[1:19:49] arms or bow and arm through both loops
[1:19:52] and that buckler would would run from
[1:19:55] all the way up to your head or right
[1:19:56] here at your head
[1:19:58] all the way down and it would cover you
[1:20:00] and god is saying that
[1:20:02] i am thy shield and i am thy buckland
[1:20:05] now they would use in
[1:20:07] in warfare they would use that shield
[1:20:09] when they would run out of arrows and
[1:20:11] they'd run out of spears or whatever
[1:20:12] they would
[1:20:13] they would use it as a block when the
[1:20:15] enemy was shooting or throwing spears at
[1:20:17] them but also they would use that
[1:20:20] as a ram when they would when they would
[1:20:22] hit them
[1:20:23] and they would charge with them that
[1:20:25] they would go forth
[1:20:26] and they would knock the enemy and try
[1:20:28] to knock him down and keep moving
[1:20:30] forward
[1:20:31] so god is saying to you that i am
[1:20:35] i am your moving forward
[1:20:39] that not only not only does he have just
[1:20:42] one hand in it
[1:20:43] but he's got the arm of the lord
[1:20:45] revealed in there
[1:20:46] he's got power revealed in there he's
[1:20:49] got authority revealed in there
[1:20:51] and if you can keep moving forward as he
[1:20:54] moves forward
[1:20:55] not go back to pentecost not go back to
[1:20:58] methodist
[1:20:59] not go back to wesley but if you can
[1:21:01] keep moving forward
[1:21:02] you can stay right behind that shield
[1:21:06] i wonder what you got as your shield
[1:21:08] today
[1:21:10] i wonder what is really your defense
[1:21:12] today
[1:21:13] is it jesus christ or is it your
[1:21:17] is it your 401k is it your job
[1:21:20] is it your family is it your loved one
[1:21:23] god is going to try you like never
[1:21:26] before to find out
[1:21:28] what your shield is
[1:21:32] there's a lot of people there's a lot of
[1:21:35] people that are so upset and i it makes
[1:21:36] me wonder sometimes
[1:21:38] it makes me wonder they're so upset
[1:21:41] about the political realm right now
[1:21:43] there's so many things going on right
[1:21:45] now and if you can just keep in the back
[1:21:48] of your mind
[1:21:48] christians that politics is of the devil
[1:21:51] but i i wonder sometimes
[1:21:54] that if god would come the day before
[1:21:57] election day would they be looking for
[1:21:59] him
[1:22:00] some people would get so upset that they
[1:22:02] didn't get to cast their vote before
[1:22:04] they got gone
[1:22:05] for me i have already cast my vote
[1:22:08] many years ago before i even had a
[1:22:12] chance
[1:22:13] he chose me before the foundation of the
[1:22:15] world
[1:22:16] i could care less if i cast my vote
[1:22:18] whether i sent my ballot in
[1:22:20] i've already chose that i'm on the
[1:22:22] winning side
[1:22:24] if you're on the devil's side you're on
[1:22:25] the loose inside but if you're on
[1:22:27] jesus's side you're on the winning side
[1:22:31] you can put biden in there you can put
[1:22:34] pelosi in there
[1:22:35] you can put trump in there all you want
[1:22:37] to brother barnum said i don't even pray
[1:22:39] for america no more
[1:22:40] he said i just committed to god
[1:22:44] america is doomed but there's a people
[1:22:47] that have a
[1:22:48] shield of protection around her
[1:22:54] hallelujah but jesus
[1:22:57] is saying to you i
[1:23:00] am thy shield jesus
[1:23:04] becomes the shield now when they were in
[1:23:07] warfare they would
[1:23:09] that that buckler that buckler would be
[1:23:12] woven with maybe different types of
[1:23:14] leather
[1:23:14] or put together with wickery of
[1:23:16] different things of different materials
[1:23:19] but they had to anoint the front of that
[1:23:21] shield
[1:23:22] so that that when the enemy was throwing
[1:23:25] darts at them
[1:23:26] or throwing spears at them that that
[1:23:29] they would quickly just a sail off of
[1:23:31] there
[1:23:32] and plus it kept it it kept it fresh
[1:23:36] that anointing kept it fresh isaiah 21-5
[1:23:40] tells us
[1:23:40] to anoint the shields but you don't have
[1:23:43] to worry about anointing jesus
[1:23:45] he's already anointed he is the christ
[1:23:48] he is the anointed one
[1:23:50] he's already anointed to take care of
[1:23:52] you
[1:23:53] and everything that you go through
[1:23:56] hallelujah now watch
[1:24:00] he said now satan's army brings diseases
[1:24:03] that's what satan is he's a destroyer
[1:24:04] satan the whole kingdom of satan is
[1:24:06] sickness
[1:24:07] death and sorrow and flusterations and
[1:24:10] worry all on satan
[1:24:12] god is life faith joy peace over here
[1:24:15] that's two great forces that's coming
[1:24:17] together right now they're battling
[1:24:18] they're battling right here in this
[1:24:20] building right now
[1:24:21] they battle day by day with you every
[1:24:23] force
[1:24:24] he said satan's following you alone that
[1:24:27] great big kingly priestly goliath
[1:24:30] and he's trying to scare the liver out
[1:24:32] of you he's right
[1:24:33] but god you're fortified a man with the
[1:24:36] gospel with the word of truth around
[1:24:38] your loin
[1:24:39] glory preacher that's what it is
[1:24:42] helmet of salvation the shield of faith
[1:24:45] and a sword waving it in your hand
[1:24:46] satan i'm coming to meet you you meet me
[1:24:49] in the name of science
[1:24:50] you meet me in the name of culture you
[1:24:52] meet me in the name of organization
[1:24:54] you meet me in the name of this that or
[1:24:56] the other but i meet you in the name of
[1:24:58] the lord god of israel
[1:25:00] i'm coming after you give away even
[1:25:03] death
[1:25:03] itself can't stand there chop a hole
[1:25:07] through it you see when david was there
[1:25:12] when he was when he was going up against
[1:25:13] goliath when he rose to the challenge
[1:25:16] saul tried to offer him his shield but
[1:25:19] david had not tested that
[1:25:21] it had not been proven by david before
[1:25:24] but he knew that if he would
[1:25:26] take the weapon that god had used with
[1:25:29] him before
[1:25:30] in times past that god would come
[1:25:33] behind it with an amen but notice david
[1:25:36] only had one spot
[1:25:38] that he could hit goliath in and that
[1:25:40] was one little spot in the forehead
[1:25:43] and brother burnham said that before
[1:25:45] david could
[1:25:46] ever let that rock loose that god went
[1:25:49] to god in that thing
[1:25:51] that god took it and he struck the
[1:25:53] goliath right in the forehead
[1:25:55] you see you've only got one place
[1:25:57] children where you can strike the enemy
[1:25:59] out and that's right in the forehead
[1:26:02] right with unbelief that's what he comes
[1:26:04] to you at is with unbelief
[1:26:06] and that's where you strike him at we
[1:26:08] are to cast down reasonings we are to
[1:26:10] cast down imaginations
[1:26:13] we're to cast down fear we're to cast
[1:26:16] down these things
[1:26:17] well i'm so worried about coving i'm not
[1:26:20] worried about coffin
[1:26:21] i'm not trying to be brash or bold here
[1:26:23] i'm only worried
[1:26:25] about one thing and that's the rapture
[1:26:27] if it comes
[1:26:28] if kovac comes my way and it's my time
[1:26:31] to go
[1:26:32] goodbye world i'm not worried about one
[1:26:36] thing because i laid all my worries on
[1:26:39] him a long time ago
[1:26:41] and i figured out a long time ago if i
[1:26:43] can lay my worries down
[1:26:47] hallelujah how's that song go i ain't
[1:26:50] gonna study war no more
[1:26:53] i'm gonna lay down my sword and shield
[1:26:56] and we'll study war no more i'm not
[1:26:59] bothered by it
[1:27:00] i'm not upset about it there's only one
[1:27:03] thing for the bride of jesus christ and
[1:27:05] that's the rapture
[1:27:08] hallelujah you look down in genesis
[1:27:11] chapter 15
[1:27:13] you go through that chapter and i i
[1:27:14] think it's a powerful chapter you go
[1:27:16] through and i think you ought to be able
[1:27:17] to see yourself there
[1:27:19] but when god is speaking to abraham and
[1:27:22] he begins to tell him
[1:27:24] in verse 13 and 14 that thy shield that
[1:27:27] that i am the shield in that book
[1:27:28] and it goes down in 13 and 14 and he
[1:27:30] begins to tell them
[1:27:32] that your seed is going to sojourn in a
[1:27:34] strange land
[1:27:36] that they're going to be strangers in
[1:27:37] that land and he said that land
[1:27:40] i have condemned them i have condemned
[1:27:43] them in that land
[1:27:45] that they're going to be strangers there
[1:27:46] they're going to be down there for 400
[1:27:48] years but i've already condemned them
[1:27:51] so before pharaoh ever knew that he was
[1:27:54] a thought
[1:27:54] god had already judged him and egypt
[1:27:57] with him
[1:27:59] and he had already chosen moses to be
[1:28:01] that deliverer
[1:28:03] so what god is telling abraham your
[1:28:05] children gonna go through some stuff
[1:28:08] your children will go through some
[1:28:10] trials they're gonna be
[1:28:12] strangers in a strange land but they're
[1:28:14] going to come out of that thing
[1:28:15] but if you watch what jesus says on the
[1:28:18] backside of verse 14
[1:28:20] he said that when they come out they're
[1:28:22] coming out with great substance
[1:28:24] he's saying to them that you're going to
[1:28:26] go through some stuff you might go
[1:28:28] through covet
[1:28:29] you might go through carmel you might
[1:28:31] lose loved ones you might go through
[1:28:33] fear you might go through all things but
[1:28:36] i want to tell you this
[1:28:38] you coming out with more than what you
[1:28:40] had when you went in
[1:28:42] hallelujah when you come out you're
[1:28:44] coming out rapture ready
[1:28:46] you're coming out in exodus form you're
[1:28:48] coming out dressed
[1:28:49] you're coming out blessed you're coming
[1:28:51] out in victory
[1:28:53] why because i am my shield when they
[1:28:56] were getting beat
[1:28:57] jesus was still their shield when when
[1:29:00] pharaoh was staring down at them and
[1:29:02] calling them nothing
[1:29:03] but a bunch of my daubers he said i am
[1:29:06] thy buckler
[1:29:08] i am your anointing i am your protection
[1:29:13] but what about the beatings what about
[1:29:16] the beatings what about the scars
[1:29:18] what about all i've been through what
[1:29:20] about covet
[1:29:21] what about laodicea i am thy shield
[1:29:25] and i am my book don't you forget
[1:29:29] even though you may be down so down far
[1:29:32] down in the mud building a brick
[1:29:38] keep beating me all you want to
[1:29:42] next time you feel like you're doing
[1:29:44] both at the same time like you're taking
[1:29:46] a beating
[1:29:47] and you're building a brick you just
[1:29:49] turn your eyes around say
[1:29:51] beat me all you want to there's an
[1:29:53] exodus at hand
[1:29:56] beat me all you want to scar me all you
[1:29:59] want to
[1:30:00] but i'm reminded about a king that one
[1:30:03] day that rolled past a war
[1:30:05] i passed a warrior that had been in war
[1:30:07] and was laying there and was all scarred
[1:30:09] up
[1:30:09] he said where did you get those scars at
[1:30:12] he said i got him when i was in the
[1:30:14] fight for you
[1:30:16] keep beating me all you want to i'm
[1:30:19] getting ready to leave

[1:30:23] investments in the bank up in the sky

[1:30:37] do god a service without being in his

[1:30:48] follow our jesus he said on one of these
[1:30:50] days he said just like elijah went up

[1:30:56] unhook the horses from the bushes
[1:30:58] and we've got to go up church

[1:33:41] abraham had to look past his flesh he
[1:33:44] had to look past his failures
[1:33:47] but abraham on the other side
[1:33:51] abraham on the other side maybe i can do
[1:33:54] this
[1:33:55] hallelujah

[1:34:03] on this side abraham was troubled on

[1:34:11] on this side hallelujah
[1:34:14] on this side abraham was a father of
[1:34:16] faith
[1:34:17] on this side of the book abraham was the
[1:34:20] father of us
[1:34:21] all on this side we are called to be
[1:34:23] abraham's seed
[1:34:25] oh church don't look past don't look
[1:34:27] back here

[1:34:33] his ways are higher than our ways
[1:34:36] hallelujah his blood is higher than
[1:34:39] church

[1:35:08] if everything around you seems to be
[1:35:11] falling apart
[1:35:14] i read a quote yesterday said talent
[1:35:17] will get you in the room
[1:35:19] but character will keep you in the room
[1:35:23] there's a lot of people now i'm gonna
[1:35:24] bridge some things right here
[1:35:27] there's a lot of people that had talent
[1:35:29] to come in the room
[1:35:31] they had talent enough to be close to
[1:35:34] abraham
[1:35:37] that was close enough to be where
[1:35:39] abraham was
[1:35:40] but they didn't have enough anointing to
[1:35:42] keep them in the room with abraham
[1:35:44] but when abraham went in that tent that
[1:35:47] night
[1:35:48] he knew everything that melchizedek had
[1:35:51] said about him
[1:35:52] was absolutely the truth i want to say
[1:35:55] this
[1:35:56] to you church of the living god
[1:35:57] everything that he said about you
[1:36:00] is nothing but the truth
[1:36:04] i believe we said some right words i
[1:36:07] believe we're right
[1:36:08] in the vision this morning if hattie
[1:36:11] wright could say the right word
[1:36:12] what about a people that's called by his
[1:36:14] name
[1:36:16] i have said the right words that this is
[1:36:19] the message
[1:36:20] of jesus christ this is the message of
[1:36:24] him goodbye world

[1:37:14] and i
[1:37:19] you've am brought on a stage
[1:37:22] for such a time as this
[1:37:28] he's the author of the word he's wrote
[1:37:31] it all out
[1:37:33] he's wrote everything out the script is
[1:37:35] wrote out
[1:37:36] like shakespeare would write out his he
[1:37:38] would write out his scripts and say the
[1:37:40] things about certain characters about
[1:37:42] romeo and juliet
[1:37:44] the script was rolled out but
[1:37:47] shakespeare on the backside it was not
[1:37:49] concerned
[1:37:51] how the characters would play out their
[1:37:52] parts because he was the one that wrote
[1:37:55] it
[1:37:56] i want you to know that god is not
[1:37:58] worried about you playing out your part
[1:37:59] he's the one that wrote it

[1:38:04] onward christian soldiers marching
[1:38:06] against the war
