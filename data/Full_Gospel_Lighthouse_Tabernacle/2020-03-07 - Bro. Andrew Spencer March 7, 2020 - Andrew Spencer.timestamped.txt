[18:40] continue to be okay
[18:41] amen amen
[18:45] glad to have sister Joyce Nicholson back

[18:55] knows each and every request Amen at
[18:58] this time I'm gonna have more than
[18:59] Fanueil Holmes if he would come he's
[19:02] going to give you a little bit of a
[19:03] report of dad there a little bit more in
[19:06] details
[19:14] they wanted me to tell you a little bit
[19:16] what was going on about brother Ron so
[19:19] he he had his surgery and there was a
[19:21] large mass that they had drained I was
[19:24] pushing putting a lot of pressure in on
[19:26] the back of his head when they when they
[19:29] punctured it and started to drain it
[19:31] ruptured and all of some of those cancer
[19:33] cells all that fluid started coming out
[19:35] so they had to have a washout of it at
[19:37] that point he's in it having a lot of
[19:40] headache pain because they actually
[19:42] drilled into the back of his skull and
[19:44] then they kind of separated it so he's
[19:46] having a lot of headache pain and also
[19:47] his blood pressure is an issue right now
[19:49] which we need to keep praying for so we
[19:51] want to really pray for his pain and his
[19:52] blood pressure they did move him out of
[19:54] ICU today he's in a step-down unit but
[19:57] he's still in a lot of pain and usually
[19:58] requiring a lot of pain medicine for for
[20:01] that headache so we just want to keep
[20:03] that on our hearts and just you know you
[20:06] can continue to keep prayer he's gonna
[20:08] have to do some radiation for the other
[20:10] tumors that are in his head they got the
[20:12] big one but he's gonna have to have some
[20:14] radiation for the other tumors in her
[20:16] knee and his head and we're still
[20:17] believing for the for the immunotherapy
[20:20] too to eat up the other cancers in its
[20:23] in his lungs and that's in his body so
[20:26] we're gonna we're gonna keep that and
[20:27] just just keep the family in prayers and
[20:29] I know that sister Connie could use your
[20:32] prayers as well whether on certainly but

[59:57] just for a moment this evening before we
[1:00:00] go into the word this evening we would
[1:00:03] like to express our love to each and
[1:00:07] every one of you and to just just stand
[1:00:12] here and say thank you we say thank you
[1:00:15] to you as a body and we say thank you to
[1:00:17] those around the world at this time we
[1:00:21] appreciate every prayer we appreciate
[1:00:23] every word of encouragement
[1:00:25] we appreciate you as a body of believers
[1:00:28] standing against this enemy that has
[1:00:30] come against us we left this church
[1:00:33] service last Sunday not knowing what we
[1:00:36] were getting ready to face but we left
[1:00:39] here saying that joy was coming in the
[1:00:41] morning and the devil was sure upset he
[1:00:46] was sure upset about that and we're so
[1:00:49] so thankful to be on the winning side
[1:00:51] and we're here to do service for our
[1:00:55] king and to report for duty and to do
[1:00:59] what He has called us to do he didn't
[1:01:01] call us to back up give up turn around
[1:01:04] but we're here to fight because that's
[1:01:09] what we as believers do we believe this
[1:01:12] this past Monday we brother on brother
[1:01:17] on was he was starting to having some
[1:01:19] vicious the vision issues on on the
[1:01:21] weekend and and he made those things
[1:01:24] known unto us but we didn't know whether
[1:01:26] that was just part of the process or
[1:01:28] what not so we didn't know what we're
[1:01:30] facing but on Monday this is how I knew
[1:01:33] that your pastor was was something was
[1:01:36] wrong as we went and we had some points
[1:01:39] on Monday morning but when brother Ron
[1:01:42] did not want to go to
[1:01:43] work with me I knew something was wrong
[1:01:46] and so we took him to the to the eye
[1:01:50] doctor and then they took him to UVA and
[1:01:53] they did an MRI and they found they
[1:01:56] found that night that brother on had a
[1:02:00] brother on had a cancer in the brain and
[1:02:03] a tumor about the size of your fist is
[1:02:06] what I understand and so they were able
[1:02:11] to remove that yesterday and we're just
[1:02:15] thankful that God has anointed man in
[1:02:17] this day to work on God's servant and he
[1:02:20] has certainly blessed him with some of
[1:02:22] the best doctors that there is the best
[1:02:25] oncologists that there is in the area to
[1:02:28] take care of these things and that's
[1:02:30] exactly what we as a body have prayed
[1:02:32] about we've asked that God would anoint
[1:02:34] men women to work on him and I'd like to
[1:02:39] just show you a clip or a picture of our
[1:02:43] pastor just this evening if that's okay
[1:02:51] that right there's a champion
[1:03:00] outright there's a champion
[1:03:08] oh man what a pastor we have what a
[1:03:20] pastor we have
[1:03:30] I don't know about you but I'm not done
[1:03:33] with him yet I'm not done with him yet
[1:03:37] and we are expecting nothing but full
[1:03:41] victory in this you know why there were
[1:03:44] people all around the world that we're
[1:03:45] praying and we can't thank them enough
[1:03:48] you as a church body can't thank them
[1:03:50] enough if you would see the prayers and
[1:03:53] the prayer chains of believers and
[1:03:56] non-believers that were praying for for
[1:03:58] our pastor it would blow your mind
[1:04:00] they'd just blow your mind and so that's
[1:04:03] why last evening last evening our pastor
[1:04:09] come out of brain surgery and he would
[1:04:10] blow you away he was giving us advice he
[1:04:14] was preaching to us just coming out of
[1:04:18] brain surgery now I get a tow ache and
[1:04:21] sometimes I don't want to talk to nobody
[1:04:24] but here our pastor has given us advice
[1:04:27] and making us laugh and and one of the
[1:04:30] things they told him that his hands were
[1:04:32] a little bit puffy and so they said that
[1:04:34] that comes from from laying on your
[1:04:36] laying on your stomach for six hours and
[1:04:41] he said well that's better than laying
[1:04:43] on your backside for eternity
[1:04:48] [Applause]
[1:04:55] I'm thankful for a man of God like
[1:04:58] brother on and tonight tonight we we
[1:05:02] felt this way I myself and brother on we
[1:05:05] felt this way earlier in the week
[1:05:06] tonight we wanted to have a service of
[1:05:10] worship and the service of prayer but

[1:05:15] going to let you get off with without
[1:05:17] giving the devil a black eye that's my

[1:14:48] called thee by thy name thou art mine
[1:14:52] when thou pass us through the waters I
[1:14:55] will be with thee and through the rivers
[1:14:58] they shall not overflow thee when thou
[1:15:02] walkest through the fire thou shall not
[1:15:05] be burned neither shall the flame Kindle

[1:15:12] Holy One of Israel thy Saviour I gave
[1:15:15] Egypt for thy ransom Ethiopia and Seba

[1:15:37] you you may be seated this evening
[1:15:41] hey ma'am mother Mathews already quoted
[1:15:47] this but this brother on spoke to us
[1:15:49] Tuesday morning sent it out to the men
[1:15:52] of God around the world after finding
[1:15:55] out that he had brain cancer and needed
[1:15:58] brain surgery to remove the mass he
[1:16:02] wrote these words never give up no
[1:16:05] retreat we are close enough now to spit
[1:16:08] in his eye and to take his head brother
[1:16:12] on wrote this note to us yesterday
[1:16:15] morning at around 5 o'clock in the
[1:16:17] morning he said on December the 22nd I
[1:16:21] was asked by the Lord that if you trust
[1:16:25] me I'll use you like
[1:16:26] before he didn't ask for money he didn't
[1:16:31] ask for homes he didn't ask for cars he
[1:16:32] asked for my life today it is his for
[1:16:38] God brain tumor cancer is not an issue
[1:16:41] to his kingdom now to myself this wave
[1:16:45] seems overwhelmingly this morning but
[1:16:49] you see he has asked me to step out of
[1:16:51] the boat saying be not afraid
[1:16:54] don't fear when the wave goes by and
[1:16:58] becomes a memory I will be found
[1:16:59] standing with Jesus who greater could we
[1:17:03] be asked to stand with God has given me
[1:17:07] the greatest friends in the entire world
[1:17:08] to have his generals around me today he
[1:17:12] had stepped from the throne to take a
[1:17:14] walk of me maybe a zigzag lightning or
[1:17:18] however he chose to come he's here we
[1:17:21] love you all
[1:17:22] keep my family and my precious wife in
[1:17:24] your prayers
[1:17:25] once again Satan has made a challenge
[1:17:28] only to meet the faith of Jesus alive
[1:17:30] and well in his bride this is a book of
[1:17:34] Acts I told Dad I told dad this week I
[1:17:39] said look when Peter stepped out on the
[1:17:42] boat he was the only one that stepped
[1:17:44] out and he walked on water twice but
[1:17:48] this time the boat is empty the boat is
[1:17:53] empty and everybody has stepped out
[1:17:55] [Applause]
[1:17:56] we're not allowing him to walk alone in
[1:17:59] this the boats empty and we're walking
[1:18:04] towards Jesus where Jesus is on his way
[1:18:08] you as a body of believers are the most
[1:18:12] powerful people you are the bride of
[1:18:14] Jesus Christ and you are fortified in
[1:18:17] the Word of God the Bible tells us that
[1:18:19] we are ambassadors that we are sons and
[1:18:23] daughters of God and we know exactly who
[1:18:26] we are and we know that we we are a
[1:18:29] people that believe more than God is
[1:18:31] able but we believe that God will
[1:18:33] perform his promises
[1:18:35] the Bible tells us in Isaiah 54 and 16
[1:18:38] behold I have created the Smith that
[1:18:41] blow if the coals in the fire and that
[1:18:44] bringeth forth an instrument for his
[1:18:46] work and I have created the waste or to
[1:18:49] destroy no weapon that is formed against
[1:18:53] thee shall prosper and every tongue that
[1:18:56] shall rise against the in judgment thou
[1:18:58] shalt condemn this is the heritage of
[1:19:02] the servants of the Lord and their
[1:19:03] righteousness is of me saith the Lord
[1:19:06] Romans 8 and 28 and we know that all
[1:19:15] things work together for good to them
[1:19:19] that love God to them who are the called
[1:19:22] according to his purpose for whom he did
[1:19:27] foreknow he also did predestinate to be
[1:19:30] conformed to the image of his son that
[1:19:34] he might be the firstborn among many
[1:19:36] brethren moreover whom he did
[1:19:39] predestinate them he also called and
[1:19:44] whom he called them he also justified
[1:19:46] and whom he justified them he also
[1:19:49] glorified what shall we say to these
[1:19:53] things for gospel light house what shall
[1:19:56] we say to these things what shall we say
[1:20:01] to these things if God be for us if God
[1:20:08] be for us
[1:20:11] if God be for us who can be against us
[1:20:22] cancer can't be against us demons of
[1:20:25] hail can't be against us if God is your
[1:20:29] partner brother Geoffrey you better have
[1:20:31] big plans proud of Jesus Christ hear me
[1:20:37] if God be for you who can be against you
[1:20:41] this battle that we have went through
[1:20:44] this past week as a body this has not
[1:20:46] just been an attack on brother wrong
[1:20:48] he's been the one that's been in the
[1:20:49] midst of the fire he's been the one and
[1:20:52] we as a family have watched every every
[1:20:55] step of this and we have documented it
[1:20:57] so well that when the the report comes
[1:21:00] through and when the when the evidence
[1:21:03] is clear we will report all of these
[1:21:06] things I have created a book I have
[1:21:09] started a book from the very beginning
[1:21:11] of this thing and when when it comes to
[1:21:14] a close I want to put it on hell's front
[1:21:17] door it said I got a package to deliver
[1:21:21] to you we come out on the winning side
[1:21:25] [Applause]
[1:21:28] whoo
[1:21:34] [Applause]
[1:21:39] you see God does all things well we all
[1:21:45] we all want the miraculous we want that
[1:21:48] instantaneous paradox that cannot be
[1:21:51] explained and even so now we are
[1:21:54] expecting that we're not doubting that
[1:21:57] but we know that God has perfected
[1:22:00] everything in in time and it will be
[1:22:03] played out exactly but there has been
[1:22:06] things that have happened this week that
[1:22:08] you can't explain
[1:22:09] there have been customers of mine that
[1:22:12] would that you as as a bride of Jesus
[1:22:15] Christ that you would never expect to be
[1:22:18] praying but they're praying
[1:23:00] be no wires in heaven but we have seen
[1:23:06] supernatural things I've seen what I
[1:23:09] would call dope addicts go to prayer I
[1:23:13] have seen men that you wouldn't expect
[1:23:16] to go to prayer there have been people
[1:23:23] that did not know exactly they know me
[1:23:26] but they didn't know brother ons name
[1:23:28] and so they knew that your pastor was a
[1:23:32] pastor and helped in Virginia so it's ok
[1:23:51] it's ok we'll just go with this so there
[1:23:56] have been those that did not know
[1:23:59] exactly brother wrongs of the wrongs
[1:24:01] name and so they they knew me as being
[1:24:04] partners in business and different
[1:24:06] different connections that we have but
[1:24:10] in all things God gets the glory and so
[1:24:14] they started looking just to find his
[1:24:17] name and they started looking pastor out
[1:24:19] to in Virginia and fell upon top of our
[1:24:22] sermons and have been listening ever
[1:24:25] since
[1:24:31] God does things well this week what I
[1:24:38] would what I would say is a miracle and
[1:24:42] then truly this is the miracle my cousin
[1:24:48] brother Gabriel who is sitting here with
[1:24:50] us tonight
[1:24:51] he came on Wednesday night and he came
[1:24:54] to the he came to the hospital room and
[1:24:57] we were there and we were listening to
[1:24:58] brother Donnie and then switched to him
[1:25:01] to brother Tim's service and just the
[1:25:04] Spirit of the Lord came down into the
[1:25:06] hospital room and did a real sovereign
[1:25:08] work and me and brother Gabriel had to
[1:25:11] leave for the night and so we were we
[1:25:14] were leaving and I could just tell that
[1:25:15] the Spirit of the Lord was was dealing
[1:25:17] with brother Gabe Roland and so early on
[1:25:21] Thursday morning he told me he said I
[1:25:24] need to go see brother on and so he went
[1:25:27] he went to see brother on and brother
[1:25:30] Gabriel dedicated his life to our Lord
[1:25:34] Jesus Christ that's America
[1:25:42] [Applause]
[1:25:49] [Music]
[1:25:51] [Applause]
[1:25:59] that's the real miracle
[1:26:09] brother Gabriel has made moves even
[1:26:12] since that time to move here to be a
[1:26:17] part of this church to transfer his job
[1:26:22] here to get involved in this church get
[1:26:25] involved with our youth because he sees
[1:26:29] the importance of his soul and brother
[1:26:33] ons words were if God sent me all the
[1:26:36] way through this for this it was worth
[1:26:40] it all to God be the glory
[1:26:50] now the Bible says in Psalms 118 it
[1:26:53] tells us of his steadfast love that it
[1:26:55] endures forever verse one will give
[1:27:00] thanks unto the Lord for he is good
[1:27:01] because his mercy endureth forever let
[1:27:06] Israel now say that his mercy endureth
[1:27:08] forever let the house of Aaron now say
[1:27:11] that his mercy endureth forever let them
[1:27:14] now that fear of the Lord say that his
[1:27:16] mercy endureth forever I called upon the
[1:27:19] Lord and distress the Lord answered me
[1:27:23] and set me in a large place the Lord is
[1:27:26] on my side I will not fear what can man

[1:28:36] spoke that morning in may in in in ohio
[1:28:41] there at brother Erickson's church when
[1:28:44] sister martha you remember the clip when
[1:28:46] sister martha erickson came down in a

[1:29:06] sweep through that room and she starts
[1:29:09] dancing and shouting across the building
[1:29:12] I believed Full Gospel lighthouse our
[1:29:15] pastor shall not die but live this
[1:29:21] sickness is not unto death those were
[1:29:27] the words that were spoken from Jesus to
[1:29:30] Martha and those same words have been
[1:29:33] spoken in this season and I want you to
[1:29:36] know that as a church that this sickness
[1:29:38] is not unto death I shall not die but
[1:29:42] live and declare the works of the Lord
[1:29:44] the Lord hath chasing me snored but he
[1:29:47] hath given me over unto death open to me

[1:30:07] is the Lord's doing it is marvelous in
[1:30:10] our eyes this is the day which the LORD
[1:30:13] hath made we will rejoice and be glad in
[1:30:17] it you tonight are the most powerful
[1:30:19] people on the face of the earth you're
[1:30:22] higher than any Congress you're the
[1:30:23] bride of Jesus Christ and he's placed
[1:30:26] you in this moment and in this season
[1:30:28] for such a time as this and no one can
[1:30:31] take your place no one can take your
[1:30:34] place all the way from a little child
[1:30:36] praying over these needs no one can take
[1:30:39] their place the Bible says in 1st Samuel
[1:30:43] 12 and 22 for the Lord will not forsake
[1:30:46] his people for his great namesake
[1:30:49] because it has pleased the Lord to make
[1:30:51] you his people the prophet told us in
[1:30:55] the revelation of Jesus Christ in the
[1:30:57] church age book now remember this Christ
[1:31:00] in the true church is a continuation of
[1:31:03] the book of Acts but the book of
[1:31:05] Revelation shows how that the Antichrist
[1:31:07] spirit would come into the church and
[1:31:09] defile it making it lukewarm formal and
[1:31:12] powerless it exposes Satan revealing his
[1:31:15] works attempted
[1:31:16] destruction of God's people and the
[1:31:19] discrediting of God's Word right down to
[1:31:22] the time that he's cast into the lake of
[1:31:24] fire
[1:31:25] he fights that he cannot stand it he
[1:31:27] knows that if the people get the true
[1:31:29] revelation of the true church and what
[1:31:32] she is and what she stands for that she
[1:31:35] can do the greater works that she will
[1:31:37] be an invincible army he's talking about
[1:31:42] you tonight you know these things are
[1:31:45] going to come you know he's going to
[1:31:47] battle us you know this Full Gospel
[1:31:49] Light House who have been through so
[1:31:51] many battles but it does not surprise
[1:31:53] you that the enemy keeps on attacking us
[1:31:55] we were talking this just this past week
[1:31:58] I was speaking with sister Tracy that
[1:32:01] about she was reminding me of the
[1:32:03] promise that just happened over about a
[1:32:06] year or so ago I believe that was about
[1:32:08] right that the Lord came down in a
[1:32:10] service and said that he was going to
[1:32:12] bless this church like never before you
[1:32:14] recall those things you have seen the
[1:32:17] Spirit of the Lord come and anoint your
[1:32:19] young people to rise to a challenge and
[1:32:22] we have seen miracles in the natural and
[1:32:25] we have seen miracles in the
[1:32:27] supernatural and we as a body we were
[1:32:31] speaking these things that 12 years ago
[1:32:33] when we as a body of believers were
[1:32:35] going through the trial of the fire that
[1:32:37] we there was just a solemn 'no stat was
[1:32:40] in that war that was in that trial you
[1:32:42] remember those things but in this trial
[1:32:45] you know exactly where you're standing
[1:32:47] at in this trial you can look right you
[1:32:49] can square your shoulders up with the
[1:32:51] devil because you know exactly who you
[1:32:53] are you have matured as a body of
[1:32:55] believers and you can look the devil in
[1:32:58] the face and you can say Satan you take
[1:33:00] your dirty hands off of God's property
[1:33:03] brother on don't belong to you he
[1:33:05] belongs to God he belongs to me as a
[1:33:07] pastor he don't belong to you as another
[1:33:10] story a statistic he belongs to us you
[1:33:14] know where you're standing at and you
[1:33:16] have went to battle like never before
[1:33:17] and we have watched those Saints you see
[1:33:21] Satan day is not going to quit battling
[1:33:23] us until we leave this war until we
[1:33:26] leave this this dispensation of time but
[1:33:30] is not going to use cowards there's some
[1:33:33] people that's afraid to speak because
[1:33:35] they're afraid that God won't show up
[1:33:36] but I want you to know that he is jehova
[1:33:40] shamma he's the Lord that is there he's
[1:33:43] a God that said that I'll never leave
[1:33:44] thee and I'll never forsake thee and
[1:33:46] when you speak those things in the name
[1:33:48] of Jesus you can expect those things
[1:33:51] brother Branham said the biggest trouble
[1:33:53] there is in the church today is a bunch
[1:33:55] of fear people is always scared and
[1:33:57] that's of the devil don't be scared be
[1:34:00] brave you don't have nothing there ain't
[1:34:02] nothing to be afraid about Church there
[1:34:04] ain't nothing to be afraid about cancer
[1:34:07] cancer is nothing to Almighty God
[1:34:10] sickness is nothing to Almighty God this
[1:34:13] is a call to prayer tonight this is a
[1:34:15] call for prayer to you for you to pray
[1:34:18] for your particles to return this is a
[1:34:20] call to prayer to pray for your pastor
[1:34:22] this is a call to prayer to pray for the
[1:34:25] bride of Jesus Christ this is a call to
[1:34:27] pray for the impossible things that are
[1:34:29] stacked up against you but against all
[1:34:31] odds God gets through don't you be
[1:34:37] afraid don't be afraid of nothing he
[1:34:40] said in Hebrews 13 and 5 I will never
[1:34:43] leave thee nor forsake thee Deuteronomy
[1:34:46] 31 and 6 be strong and of a good courage
[1:34:49] fear not nor be afraid for of them for
[1:34:52] the Lord thy God here it is that doeth
[1:34:54] go with thee he will not fail thee nor
[1:34:57] forsake thee Joshua 1 and 5 there so not
[1:35:01] any man be able to stand before thee all
[1:35:03] the days of thy life as I was with Moses
[1:35:06] so I will be with thee I will not fail
[1:35:09] thee nor forsake thee some 37 and 23 the
[1:35:14] steps of a good man are ordered by the
[1:35:16] Lord and he delighteth in his way though
[1:35:20] he fall he shall not be utterly cast
[1:35:23] down for the lord upholdeth him with his
[1:35:25] hand i have been young and now am i old
[1:35:27] yet have i not seen the righteous
[1:35:30] forsaken nor his seed begging for bread
[1:35:33] he is ever merciful and linda 'the and
[1:35:36] his seed is blessed Hebrews 4 and 14
[1:35:41] seeing then that we have a great high
[1:35:43] priest that is passed into the heavens
[1:35:46] Jesus the Son of God let us hold fast
[1:35:49] our profession but we have not a high
[1:35:52] priest which cannot be touched by the
[1:35:54] feeling of our infirmities but was in
[1:35:56] all points tempted like as we were we
[1:35:59] are yet without sin let us therefore
[1:36:02] come boldly unto the throne of grace
[1:36:04] that we may obtain mercy and find grace
[1:36:07] to help in a time of need you remember
[1:36:10] what brother Donnie preached to you at
[1:36:12] Labor Day confession there's power in
[1:36:14] your confession ABC except believe and
[1:36:18] confess he can't do nothing for you
[1:36:22] until you confess it to start confessing
[1:36:25] the things that you're going to see
[1:36:27] tonight as you're praying I want you to
[1:36:30] confess the things that you may not see
[1:36:32] with your eyes but the things that you
[1:36:34] will see the things that you see by your
[1:36:36] faith your five senses of see taste feel
[1:36:40] smell in here they may not see the
[1:36:41] healing they may not see the miraculous
[1:36:44] but faith says it's coming faith says
[1:36:47] it's coming to pass because by His Word
[1:36:49] it's coming to pass we are believers and
[1:36:52] believing it's what we do best in
[1:36:55] moments like this this is when we were
[1:36:57] called to go to battle jesus said in
[1:37:01] Matthew seven and seven ask and it shall
[1:37:04] be given you seek and you shall find
[1:37:07] knock and it shall be opened unto you
[1:37:09] for every one that asketh receiveth and
[1:37:12] he that seeketh findeth and to him that
[1:37:14] knocketh it shall be opened mark 9 and
[1:37:17] 23 jesus said unto them if thou canst
[1:37:20] believe all things are possible to them
[1:37:24] that believe how many believers we got
[1:37:26] here tonight all things are possible to
[1:37:29] you Hebrews 11 and 6 but without faith
[1:37:32] it is impossible to please him for he
[1:37:35] that cometh to God must believe that he
[1:37:37] is and that he is a rewarder of them
[1:37:39] that diligently seek Him mark 11 and 22
[1:37:44] and Jesus answering saying unto them
[1:37:47] have faith in God that's pretty
[1:37:50] separated
[1:37:52] have faith in God for verily I say unto
[1:37:55] you that whosoever shall say unto this
[1:37:58] mountain I love that Jesus didn't put no
[1:38:01] stipulation on who had to ask it but he
[1:38:04] said whosoever shall say to this
[1:38:06] mountain be thou removed and be thou
[1:38:09] cast into the sea and shall not doubt in
[1:38:12] his heart but shall believe that those
[1:38:14] things which he saith shall come to pass
[1:38:17] he shall have whatsoever he saith
[1:38:21] therefore I say unto you I believe Jesus
[1:38:28] is talking to you tonight I believe
[1:38:30] Jesus came all the way to help to
[1:38:32] Virginia to talk to you tonight
[1:38:34] therefore I say unto you as a body of
[1:38:37] believers that--what's things soever you
[1:38:39] desire when you pray believe that you
[1:38:43] receive them and you shall have them
[1:38:47] brother brother said let your faith
[1:38:48] loose let it loose tonight I want to
[1:38:54] show you what the devil said that he
[1:38:58] said on Thursday he was going to destroy
[1:39:00] him he said all week long he was going

[1:39:05] could get you down as a body of
[1:39:07] believers he thought you could get you
[1:39:08] down on Tuesday he thought he could get
[1:39:11] you down but joy came in the morning on

[1:41:04] when you're dealing with the brain
[1:41:05] you're dealing with a very a very
[1:41:08] significant part of the body but as the
[1:41:12] surgery was going on all day yesterday I
[1:41:17] began to think about the intellect of
[1:41:21] the brain and I begin to think about the
[1:41:24] headship and I begin to think about our
[1:41:27] head chef that has come down in this day
[1:41:30] that the intellect is now into the body
[1:41:34] you see Satan said that he would never
[1:41:37] allow you as a body to walk but you're
[1:41:40] walking he said as an enemy of God he
[1:41:45] said that you would never talk but
[1:41:47] you're talking he tried to put it in
[1:41:50] your mind that you wouldn't see no more
[1:41:52] but you're seeing I can't put it no
[1:41:57] better than this this came from sister
[1:42:00] Lydia Pruitt Oglesby when she's seen
[1:42:03] that clip praise our God take that devil

[1:42:27] [Music]
[1:42:33] on Friday morning as you can imagine as
[1:42:38] a son it's quite toast about praying all
[1:42:43] night trying to get some rest because I
[1:42:47] know that I had battled to do the next
[1:42:49] day but yet in my flesh I knew we were
[1:42:53] in a war so I just spent the night in
[1:42:56] prayer and at 2:40 in the morning this
[1:43:03] was the morning of the surgery I woke up
[1:43:05] to a being in our room to an audible
[1:43:10] voice and a holy presence in that room
[1:43:13] and the voice said let's stand
[1:43:17] I stood to my feet in that moment and I
[1:43:22] worship the Lord I stood in that holy
[1:43:25] presence and I said God if you stay if
[1:43:28] you said for me to stand
[1:43:29] I'm understand Church I don't think that
[1:43:34] was just a word for me I think that was
[1:43:35] a word for you I think that was a word
[1:43:41] for the body price let's stand let's
[1:43:46] stand you remember the vision o thou
[1:43:50] sufferest stand and be healed in the
[1:43:53] name of Jesus Christ and he came back
[1:43:57] home Friday morning to tell you let's
[1:44:00] stand you're gonna go through some
[1:44:02] battles but you want to stand you got to
[1:44:04] remember that this is a marathon and
[1:44:06] every morning you're going to wake up
[1:44:08] and you want it to stand like never
[1:44:09] before I'm standing to my feet I'm
[1:44:15] standing as a son I'm not just standing
[1:44:17] as a son or on Spencer I'm standing as a
[1:44:19] son of God
[1:44:21] Mike was stood to his feet in Daniel 12
[1:44:25] Michael was standing the mighty angel
[1:44:28] stands in revelations 10 and John stands
[1:44:31] and takes the book and revelations 10
[1:44:33] and 8 and we must stand on God's
[1:44:37] promises every day it's our call to
[1:44:42] stand as the musicians come the Bible
[1:44:52] tells us in Ephesians 6 and 13 wherefore
[1:44:55] take unto you the whole armour of God
[1:44:57] that you may be able to withstand in the
[1:44:59] evil day and having done all to stand
[1:45:01] stand therefore stand therefore having
[1:45:05] your loins Girt about with truth and
[1:45:08] having on the breastplate of
[1:45:09] righteousness we have been commissioned
[1:45:11] to stand to stand against the methods of
[1:45:14] the devil against this different means
[1:45:17] as plans and schemes which he uses to
[1:45:19] deceive and entrap and enslave and to
[1:45:22] ruin the souls of men were called to
[1:45:24] stand against it the Bible says in James
[1:45:27] 4 and 7 submit yourselves therefore to
[1:45:29] God resists the devil
[1:45:31] and he will flee from you resist means
[1:45:35] to withstand the action of the devil to
[1:45:37] refuse to accept refuse to go along with
[1:45:39] and we refute him we deny him you see if
[1:45:45] he could hinder this service he'd hinder
[1:45:47] it he wants to hinder your prayer life
[1:45:49] he wants to hinder your walk with God
[1:45:52] resist the devil and he will flee from
[1:45:54] you resist the devil and he will flee
[1:45:59] from you do you realize what that
[1:46:00] scripture saying to you it is saying
[1:46:02] that he is a bigger coward than you
[1:46:04] could ever imagine being resist the
[1:46:07] devil and he will flee from you the
[1:46:10] Satan ain't scared of you as a man in
[1:46:12] the flesh but he is scared of your
[1:46:14] position that you hold as a son of God
[1:46:17] resist the devil and he will flee from
[1:46:20] you you've been called to pray brother
[1:46:29] Branham said prayer is the key that's
[1:46:31] the answer prayer changes things
[1:46:35] murder is the most powerful weapon there
[1:46:37] was ever put on the control of human
[1:46:39] beings
[1:46:40] there's no atomic bomb or no hydrogen
[1:46:43] bomb as powerful as prayer prayer will
[1:46:46] change the mind of God did you know that
[1:46:48] it did do it one time a prophet was sent
[1:46:50] up to the king in the chamber and said
[1:46:52] go up and tell him thus saith the Lord
[1:46:55] he's not coming off the bed he's going
[1:46:57] to die right there where he's had Isaiah
[1:47:00] went up and told Hezekiah and I could
[1:47:03] imagine all the celebrity at the gate
[1:47:05] the peasants out at the outer courts
[1:47:08] when they went in and said old prophet
[1:47:10] of God that would be come out what will
[1:47:13] become of our King thus saith the Lord
[1:47:15] he's going to die
[1:47:17] went out to the soldiers o great prophet
[1:47:19] what does the Lord say about our King us
[1:47:21] say if the Lord is going to die and
[1:47:23] that's what's right the Lord told him
[1:47:26] that goes on down gets in his little Hut
[1:47:28] somewhere and back in the wilderness and
[1:47:30] Hezekiah turned his face to the law and
[1:47:33] wept bitterly and said lord I beseech
[1:47:35] you to consider me I walk before you
[1:47:38] with a perfect heart I need 15 years
[1:47:41] longer to get my kingdom in condition
[1:47:45] and prayer changed hezekiah circumstance
[1:47:50] Hezekiah prayed and he got 15 more years
[1:47:54] Hezekiah the King knew how to pray when
[1:47:58] they were in a battle he prayed and 185
[1:48:00] thousand Assyrians were destroyed by
[1:48:03] hailstones by coming from Almighty God
[1:48:05] I'd say that those were rocks from
[1:48:07] another world
[1:48:09] Elysa prayed to God and God directed him
[1:48:12] to the person who should be the wife to
[1:48:14] Isaac Jacob prayed to God and God
[1:48:17] inclined the heart of his irritated
[1:48:19] brother so that they met him peace and
[1:48:21] friendship
[1:48:22] Samson prayed to God and God showed him
[1:48:24] a well where he quenched his burning
[1:48:26] thirst and so lived to judge Israel
[1:48:29] Daniel prayed and God enabled him both
[1:48:32] to tell Nebuchadnezzar his dream and to
[1:48:35] give the interpretation of it nehemiah
[1:48:38] prayed in God inclined the heart of the
[1:48:39] king of Persia to grant him a leave of
[1:48:41] absence to visit and rebuild Jerusalem
[1:48:44] Esther and Mordecai prayed and God
[1:48:46] defeated the purpose of Haman and saved
[1:48:48] the Jews from destruction the believers
[1:48:51] in Jerusalem prayed and God opened the
[1:48:53] prison doors and set Peter at liberty
[1:48:55] Paul prayed that the thorn in the flesh
[1:48:58] might be removed and his prayer brought
[1:49:01] a large increase of spiritual strength
[1:49:03] when the thorn perhaps remained and we
[1:49:06] as believers have watched mountains fall
[1:49:09] because of prayer we've seen the dead
[1:49:13] raised because of prayer we've seen
[1:49:16] product was returned because of prayer
[1:49:18] we've seen hearts transform because of
[1:49:21] prayer in my the Flyleaf of my Bible is

[1:49:35] open we've seen cripples walk we've seen
[1:49:39] brain bleeds come to a halt we've seen
[1:49:42] barren wounds after 16 years bring forth
[1:49:44] life we've seen the curse of sin stopped

[1:49:51] of Prayer and tonight God has called us
[1:49:55] to pray to pray like never before

[2:01:17] the battle they went into service for
[2:01:20] the king they went into their war room

[2:05:55] leadership that's our pastor Lord how
[2:06:00] many times father has he's been given a
[2:06:03] vision from the Lord that was so
[2:06:06] specific for this body of believers and
[2:06:10] I'd say that if they could raise their
[2:06:11] hand that they could raise their hand in
[2:06:14] the natural would say that it was that
[2:06:16] it was a vision that was meant for me
[2:06:18] and that leadership told me to do
[2:06:21] such-and-such and I did it just because
[2:06:25] I received it in though as a word of the
[2:06:27] Lord and he came to pass the Father you
[2:06:30] have given us a vision the Prophet told
[2:06:34] us every time we look into the word that
[2:06:37] we have seen a vision Alleluia
[2:06:44] he was wounded for our transgressions he
[2:06:48] was bruised for our iniquities and the
[2:06:51] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[2:06:53] and by His stripes Ron Switzer is healed
[2:06:57] father we just see the vision as a body
[2:07:01] of believers switches on the television
[2:07:03] we've seen what's coming to pass father
[2:07:06] the father they have removed him from
[2:07:08] the ICU to a step-down unit boy the
[2:07:12] father raised that you remove him as you
[2:07:15] see fit father Lord Jesus he has told me
[2:07:19] personally that until I'm able to stand
[2:07:23] behind this pulpit that I'm gonna coach
[2:07:24] you and I'm gonna preach to you and I'm
[2:07:26] gonna I'm gonna advise you and I'm gonna
[2:07:28] stand behind you and I'm gonna give
[2:07:30] every power scripture and every power
[2:07:32] quote that we can throw at this demon so
[2:07:35] Satan I want you to hear me loud and
[2:07:37] clear
[2:07:38] not water I want you to look at us as
[2:07:41] the body our heads are hanging high
[2:07:43] they're not hanging down when you looked
[2:07:46] upon us and you thought that we were
[2:07:48] about to say it's over
[2:07:50] and it looked like we were about to say
[2:07:52] that it's all God we lifted our head and
[2:07:56] said a man you thought we were defeated
[2:07:59] but we lived in our head and said a man
[2:08:01] and we have come out victorious but how
[2:08:06] small things have looked things that we
[2:08:11] thought were so big in daily life had
[2:08:15] become so small you've made us allow
[2:08:18] allowed us to realize how precious life
[2:08:21] is
[2:08:23] but God standing at this altar is a
[2:08:28] people that have need
[2:08:30] they have need of you standing around
[2:08:34] this alters newborn babes in Christ that
[2:08:37] need an old-fashioned and the cost of
[2:08:41] experience they can come here like here
[2:08:45] every scripture here of a quote and here
[2:08:48] of a story we're not here to give him
[2:08:51] head knowledge we're here to lead them
[2:08:53] to an old-fashioned Holy Ghost revival
[2:08:55] in their soul and I pray that you give
[2:08:59] it to him I was speaking to a man today
[2:09:02] in the West Indies he was testifying to
[2:09:05] me today about the god of creation that
[2:09:08] that called his nervousness when he
[2:09:11] started here in the word of the Lord and
[2:09:13] it was asking for a Pentecost in his
[2:09:17] life I told him you don't have to wait
[2:09:20] you can have that right now my father
[2:09:24] sitting around this church is people
[2:09:26] that need an old-fashioned filling of
[2:09:28] the Holy Ghost and I pray you give it to
[2:09:30] him in Jesus name father I pray there's
[2:09:34] those that have need of loved ones to
[2:09:36] return and I pray that we as we display
[2:09:40] the token over our household we send the
[2:09:43] Holy Ghost out to him just now and I
[2:09:45] pray that you return the prodigal

[2:10:00] health in the name of Jesus father I
[2:10:03] look out upon a body and the reason why
[2:10:07] we have called this moment of Prayer is
[2:10:09] because this people's faith it's higher
[2:10:12] than it's ever been before
[2:10:14] Lord I have I have walked into a
[2:10:17] conference when I stepped in this pulpit
[2:10:21] I I felt the pulsation of the Holy Ghost
[2:10:23] and the people's faith to reach out and
[2:10:26] touch an omnipotent God
[2:10:28] or all we needs the least but a touch of
[2:10:32] you I pray father these things we've
[2:10:38] asked father we ask them in the name of
[2:10:45] the Lord Jesus Christ a God you know
[2:10:53] where the road is going to take us in
[2:10:55] life you know where we're gonna walk but

[2:12:21] miracles
[2:12:28] something has happened
[2:12:32] I look out across his congregation by
[2:12:35] the way of faith that I look upon a
[2:12:37] little lady
[2:12:38] that moved here about a year and a half
[2:12:41] ago that had a lump in her stomach
[2:12:44] it started like it great then moved to

[2:13:00] grapefruit

[2:13:44] flower a bit of ease but you promised to
[2:13:46] set your grace is sufficient father we
[2:13:50] don't ask why we ask who Satan has
[2:13:55] attacked us

[2:14:04] who can be against me you promised us
[2:14:13] that no weapon that is formed against us
[2:14:15] shall prosper it tells us that there's a
[2:14:19] weapon that's trying to kill us
[2:14:21] trying to steal us of a pastor trying to
[2:14:25] destroy us as a people but it shall not
[2:14:28] prosper oh god I pray that you would
