[44:11] i just pray tonight that something would
[44:13] be said to encourage you and give you
[44:16] faith to press the battle
[44:17] man we didn't come here to edify
[44:19] ourselves we come here to edify christ
[44:21] and if we build christ up that'll build
[44:23] you up
[44:25] amen
[44:26] mark 11 22 and jesus answering saith
[44:30] unto them
[44:31] have faith in god
[44:33] for verily i say unto you that whosoever
[44:35] shall say unto this mountain be thou
[44:38] removed and be thou cast into the sea
[44:41] and shall not doubt in his heart
[44:43] but he but but shall believe that those
[44:46] things which he saith
[44:48] shall come to pass he shall have
[44:51] whatsoever
[44:53] he saith
[44:55] those are powerful words
[44:57] if you can believe in your heart
[44:58] whatever you've asked
[45:00] you can have it
[45:02] may the lord jesus had his blessing
[45:03] tonight you may be seated
[45:12] i'd like to speak this evening on if i
[45:13] can and
[45:15] it may continue toward tomorrow but
[45:18] i want to speak on the key to your
[45:20] miracle
[45:21] is the channel of inspiration
[45:26] and i want to read you a quote brother
[45:27] adam talks about and modern events are
[45:29] made clear by prophecy he says the bible
[45:31] is to be revealed
[45:33] by inspiration
[45:35] and that's the only thing inspiration
[45:38] jesus told peter upon this rock
[45:41] this rock of revelation reveals who he
[45:45] is
[45:46] and as we as we speak tonight now on the
[45:49] key to your miracle
[45:51] i clicked over into the bible today and
[45:53] as with brother andrew and we i was
[45:56] looking up this he was in the suit store
[45:58] and i was studying
[45:59] and he said i'm sorry i'm taking so long
[46:01] i said honestly no problem i'm studying
[46:03] so that that's fine
[46:05] and
[46:06] i clicked on the word miracle in the new
[46:08] testament and it's actually
[46:10] dominant dumas
[46:13] which means a force
[46:15] specifically a miraculous power
[46:19] used by implication a miracle itself the
[46:22] ability the abundance the meaning
[46:25] the might
[46:27] the workers of a miracle is power
[46:30] strength
[46:31] violence and a mighty wonderful work
[46:36] and brother branham would come along and
[46:37] tell us that a miracle is something
[46:40] that's not understood
[46:44] it's a paradox
[46:46] it's something that happens yet there's
[46:48] no scientific proof that it could be
[46:51] that way but we're not going by
[46:53] scientific proof we're going by
[46:55] revelation of the word of god god
[46:58] inspires it to your heart and you
[47:00] believe it
[47:02] and that settles it now the bible tells
[47:04] us
[47:05] excuse me
[47:07] that men of old were moved by the holy
[47:09] ghost
[47:10] so the bible was written
[47:13] by the prophets down through the ages
[47:15] but it was actually god
[47:17] speaking to the prophets
[47:20] and if god spoke the word and it become
[47:22] the written word it must come to pass
[47:28] god spoke again in this day through a
[47:30] prophet which we're all aware of and if
[47:33] he's taught listen brother ben said if
[47:34] it's truly god it'll be exactly like it
[47:38] said
[47:39] so there's no questioning whether the
[47:41] message is correct or not we all believe
[47:43] that
[47:45] and if we don't access you do by the end
[47:47] of the service
[47:50] so when a prophet speaks something you
[47:53] can write it down take it to the bank
[47:55] and it's going to be that way
[47:58] you don't have to wonder well i wonder
[47:59] if he hid it i wonder if he missed it no
[48:01] he hit it
[48:03] if he's in that channel of inspiration
[48:05] it'll be exactly like he said it
[48:10] it's like simeon of old in the bible he
[48:12] knew he was going to see the coming of
[48:13] the lord jesus
[48:16] he's an old man
[48:18] and god reveals it to him you're going
[48:20] to see the coming of the lord jesus and
[48:22] he began telling people i will see the
[48:24] coming of the lord jesus to the point
[48:26] that people thought he was crazy
[48:30] but he said he believed it anyhow
[48:35] let me just stop and put something right
[48:37] here
[48:39] two years ago
[48:41] in just a couple of days
[48:44] the lord jesus of the angel spoke to
[48:46] brother ron and said if you trust me
[48:48] with your life
[48:50] i'll use you like never before.
[48:53] amen you're all witnesses of that
[48:57] brother said how is it happening it's
[48:59] happening
[49:00] listen it's a paradox what's taking
[49:03] place
[49:04] it's something that we can't understand
[49:07] but yet it's god
[49:08] it's nothing i can produce it's nothing
[49:11] brother ron can produce but that's what
[49:13] god said it and god is fulfilling it
[49:20] people think we're crazy
[49:23] that's okay
[49:25] because i think they are
[49:29] you think i'm crazy enough well i might
[49:30] think you are
[49:32] see that thing goes both ways but it's
[49:34] not about whether you think i'm crazy or
[49:36] i think you're crazy it's about what did
[49:38] god say in his word and god said i'm the
[49:41] lord thy god that he love all
[49:44] thy diseases
[49:45] [Applause]
[49:51] we need miracles in our lives
[49:54] we need miracles in this church
[49:56] your pastor needs a miracle
[49:58] i might need a miracle whoever might
[50:00] need a miracle but there's a key to that
[50:03] we have to get into the channel of
[50:05] inspiration until god would speak to us
[50:09] and then we without even questioning it
[50:12] speak it
[50:17] and then you watch god back it up
[50:19] simon's like you know what i know i'm
[50:20] old and i'm and people think i'm crazy
[50:23] but
[50:23] i'm still going to see jesus
[50:26] and one day he walked into the temple
[50:28] and all of a sudden here came mary in
[50:31] and revelation struck him that's the one
[50:35] and he ran over and he grabbed the child
[50:37] and he held him in his arms and he said
[50:40] mine eyes have seen the salvation thy
[50:42] salvation he knew what it was because he
[50:45] knew god had revealed it to him
[50:49] that he was going to see the christ
[50:50] before he died
[50:53] and that was it
[50:54] he's ready to die now
[50:56] because he had seen the promised word of
[50:58] god
[51:01] we'll see what brother abraham says and
[51:02] i have heard but now i see
[51:05] he said now when you're prayed for you
[51:07] don't have to run back through a prayer
[51:09] line
[51:09] or let somebody else pray for you
[51:12] when you know you've done exactly what
[51:15] god told you to do
[51:20] if you're doing what god told you to do
[51:23] you've done it god told you to do it
[51:25] then wait for that channel of
[51:28] inspiration
[51:29] to open up to you and now
[51:33] i'm healed
[51:36] and he said and when that drops in there
[51:40] it's all over
[51:43] all right
[51:44] it's all over oh you don't need no
[51:46] prayer lines
[51:47] you don't need nothing else it's over
[51:50] why because it's been revealed to you
[51:53] when you hit the channel of inspiration
[51:55] now it's been personally revealed to you
[51:58] that's like it was when you first saw
[52:00] this message
[52:03] i don't know some of you i see some new
[52:04] faces i hadn't seen there before some
[52:06] moved in
[52:08] but god knows your story
[52:11] and god knows where you've been at and
[52:13] god knows what you've struggled with and
[52:15] god knows how to get you to overcome and
[52:18] god knows everything that you had need
[52:20] of before the foundation of the world
[52:22] and he knew that one night he would drop
[52:24] channel of that inspiration would jump
[52:26] right down inside of you and you would
[52:28] walk out of here a completely whole
[52:31] different person
[52:36] completely over with
[52:40] i'm healed i'm saved i'm delivered
[52:44] i'm whatever you whatever it is
[52:46] put it there
[52:47] let me read you one now one more out of
[52:49] jehovah jiren 1955.
[52:53] he said it is only the love of our
[52:55] father
[52:56] that loves you so much that he sends his
[52:58] word he sends his ministers
[53:02] to preach the word
[53:04] and then he sends gifts into the church
[53:06] with his arms spread out trying to get
[53:08] you to believe it
[53:10] he wants to heal you tonight
[53:14] you ready for the next line
[53:17] a thousand times more
[53:20] than you want to be healed
[53:27] brother ron just think how much you want
[53:28] god to heal you tonight
[53:30] he wants to heal you a thousand times
[53:32] more
[53:35] well jason what's hindered all we need
[53:37] is to drop into that channel
[53:39] and you can't make yourself get in the
[53:41] channel
[53:43] see that's the deal people want to try
[53:44] to pull themselves into that you can't
[53:46] make yourself have a revelation it takes
[53:48] god at that direct moment and that
[53:50] direct second to give you that
[53:52] revelation
[53:54] now god's using this man like never
[53:56] before because that's what he told him
[53:57] he would do and we see it all around the
[53:59] world thousands have hope tonight that
[54:01] they can overcome cancer thousands have
[54:03] hoped that they can still stand behind
[54:05] the pulpit and preach the gospel
[54:07] regardless what their problems are
[54:13] but god ain't done yet
[54:19] i said god ain't done yet
[54:22] god still got things to work he's still
[54:24] got things to do i believe so so while
[54:26] he's here now he wants to hear you a
[54:27] thousand times more than you want to be
[54:28] healed but you're afraid
[54:30] see you want to go by how you feel
[54:33] because you've regarded that you've
[54:35] lived by your feelings
[54:38] your whole life has been wrapped up in
[54:40] that but you must get away from that and
[54:43] act on god's word not on what you feel
[54:52] we've all heard brother ram say
[54:54] i'm so sick tonight
[54:56] i'm just hanging onto this pulpit
[54:58] and my knuckles are turning white
[55:04] he was sick and he'd say well i got to
[55:06] go down there and preach tonight
[55:08] i have a message on my heart he'd come
[55:10] down brother neville graciously would
[55:12] ask him to preach
[55:15] because he knew if he put god first
[55:17] god take care of the rest
[55:22] and i've seen a man stand behind the
[55:23] pulpit for a year and a half now or
[55:25] longer
[55:27] i knowing he don't feel like getting up
[55:29] and preaching every sunday
[55:31] or every saturday
[55:33] but god will reward that sacrifice
[55:38] listen and thank god that he placed a
[55:40] man of god among you that loves the lord
[55:43] jesus and loves this congregation
[55:47] let me tell you god ain't through yet
[55:50] god's gonna get a channel of inspiration
[55:52] in the house of god and somebody is
[55:54] gonna step in that channel
[56:10] said you must get away from that and act
[56:13] on god's word not what you feel
[56:15] not what you see
[56:17] that's what he preached on
[56:19] just a couple of weeks ago or last week
[56:23] not what you feel not what you see but
[56:25] what god said
[56:27] act on that make a confession of that
[56:31] confession means to say the same thing
[56:34] and god said i've already healed you so
[56:38] whatever your need might be you begin to
[56:40] confess that
[56:42] over and over and over i heard him say
[56:45] i'm driving up here from from home he
[56:47] said you know what you just keep
[56:48] knocking on the door of god
[56:50] and you say lord i'm having a good time
[56:53] knocking
[56:54] and you put yourself on god's hands and
[56:56] he said god has got to get you off of
[56:59] his hands so he's got to move somehow or
[57:02] another
[57:04] god i'm going to keep knocking
[57:06] i hope you're getting tired of hearing
[57:08] me because i i'm really enjoying it
[57:13] lord i'm ready for my channel
[57:16] i'm ready to step into it lord
[57:18] i need god to let everything else go i
[57:21] need to focus my life upon you lord i
[57:23] need to quit looking at everything
[57:24] around me and i need to focus on the
[57:26] word of god
[57:28] and when it's been revealed to you
[57:30] that you yourself has received god's
[57:33] promise he said that's the inspiration
[57:39] you being a christian he said it struck
[57:42] you
[57:46] might not strike an unbeliever like that
[57:49] but it struck you
[57:50] and he said and the only thing you need
[57:52] to do is open up your heart for the
[57:54] mechanics are ready
[57:56] let the inspiration drop in which is the
[57:59] dynamics let that drop on the inside of
[58:02] you and then nothing he said can change
[58:05] your mind
[58:10] once that strikes
[58:12] once it's right here nobody can change
[58:14] it
[58:15] the doctor walks in and goes well
[58:18] you got about five minutes
[58:21] i preached a man's funeral the other day
[58:23] who would
[58:25] 26 months ago the doctors told him he
[58:27] had six months
[58:30] he lived another 20 months
[58:33] on hospice the entire time but he lived
[58:36] it
[58:38] and he you know he didn't go when he
[58:40] first told him he would go he wasn't
[58:41] ready to go
[58:43] because it got down to about the last
[58:44] couple weeks of his life and all of a
[58:46] sudden it struck him one day
[58:49] i'm not afraid to die anymore
[58:53] he was scared to death to die but he got
[58:56] to the point he said i'm not afraid to
[58:57] die
[58:59] he done made his calling and his
[59:01] election short he wasn't scared anymore
[59:06] inspiration struck me old man
[59:11] the chaplain of the
[59:12] hospice guy had up and he said
[59:17] he said you know what he said
[59:18] dawn's been afraid to die for forever
[59:20] ever since he's been here he said but
[59:21] he's he's outlived i've never had a
[59:24] patient that's lived this long
[59:26] ever
[59:27] and you've been doing it a long time
[59:30] but you might not i never had a patient
[59:32] that was a seed gene of god that had to
[59:35] come to the realization of who he was
[59:38] and come to the point that he said no
[59:39] matter what happens to me i'm ready to
[59:42] go
[59:46] nothing then can change your mind
[59:50] job needed that channel of inspiration
[59:54] job was a man we all know the story of
[59:56] job how he had everything he lost
[59:58] everything
[1:00:02] he had a way of moving himself out
[1:00:04] though and letting the word of god move
[1:00:06] in
[1:00:08] one day all he'd done lost everything
[1:00:10] just about one day his best buddies come
[1:00:12] to him job
[1:00:15] you're a secret center
[1:00:18] troop said no
[1:00:20] you've missed that one oh boy
[1:00:22] i've checked my life
[1:00:24] i made the sacrifices
[1:00:26] all right i didn't just make them for
[1:00:28] myself i made them for my children
[1:00:31] pre-eventually they would do it wrong
[1:00:33] lord let me make a sacrifice for him and
[1:00:35] job made sure he had all the t's crossed
[1:00:39] and the eyes dotted
[1:00:41] and job said well you know what you can
[1:00:42] say what you want but i'm telling you
[1:00:44] right now
[1:00:45] i've got everything right
[1:00:49] no job no you're missing something
[1:00:50] you're missing something
[1:00:52] you're missing
[1:00:54] you're a secret
[1:00:55] for if you weren't a secret sinner
[1:00:58] all these things wouldn't be happening
[1:00:59] to you
[1:01:05] even to the point to miss job
[1:01:09] said curse god and die
[1:01:13] and a lot of people always look down on
[1:01:14] this joe because she said curse god and
[1:01:16] die but let me tell you brother brian
[1:01:17] told us that the the lady is the weaker
[1:01:19] vessel
[1:01:21] so she was she was crushing underneath
[1:01:23] that pressure
[1:01:25] seeing her husband in that condition
[1:01:26] seeing him lose everything he had and
[1:01:28] all of a sudden though job said woman
[1:01:30] you speak like a foolish woman he didn't
[1:01:32] call her foolish you speak like a
[1:01:34] foolish woman and revelation begins
[1:01:36] striking him
[1:01:38] [Music]
[1:01:40] revelation began heading home to him i
[1:01:42] tell you what yeah i might be down here
[1:01:44] on the high street and i might have
[1:01:45] balls from head to toe and i might have
[1:01:47] lost everything i've ever had
[1:01:50] but blessed be the name of the lord for
[1:01:52] the lord giveth and the lord taketh
[1:01:56] and then he begin to prophesy naked come
[1:01:58] i into the world naked shall i go out of
[1:02:01] the world but blessed be the name of the
[1:02:03] lord and about that time a vision opened
[1:02:05] up
[1:02:09] the prophet of god said he caught a
[1:02:11] revelation
[1:02:13] of what a resurrection was going to be
[1:02:16] and when he caught that revelation
[1:02:18] inspiration he got in that channel
[1:02:22] hallelujah and when job got in the
[1:02:24] channel could nothing get him out of the
[1:02:26] channel
[1:02:27] let me tell you until it all come to
[1:02:29] pass and god began to restore all that
[1:02:32] he lost
[1:02:36] and he didn't just restore it
[1:02:39] he multiplied it
[1:02:44] see god's not going to put you through
[1:02:46] something
[1:02:47] and not give you a boost after you come
[1:02:49] out of it
[1:02:50] god don't put you through a storm to
[1:02:52] leave you shipwrecked and beaten and
[1:02:55] down in despair
[1:02:57] but god puts you in a storm to bring you
[1:02:59] out on the other side even a better man
[1:03:01] than you was when you went through it
[1:03:04] because that's how god works
[1:03:06] god does this it's his doing he does it
[1:03:09] that he might get all the glory
[1:03:23] that came fresh right there
[1:03:28] as long as god's in it
[1:03:31] don't worry
[1:03:34] don't worry about it
[1:03:38] it's usually when trouble comes
[1:03:41] they want to disagree with you
[1:03:43] when trouble comes in
[1:03:44] that's how your friends are
[1:03:46] when you get your back against the wall
[1:03:48] then they want to start saying maybe
[1:03:50] maybe
[1:03:52] maybe
[1:03:57] them aren't friends
[1:04:00] them are enemies
[1:04:02] for a true friend no matter what you're
[1:04:04] going through
[1:04:06] will be like david was when he began to
[1:04:08] speak about the lord though i walk
[1:04:10] through the valley of the shadow of
[1:04:11] death i will fear no evil for thou
[1:04:14] art with me
[1:04:20] you want to know who your real friends
[1:04:22] are getting a
[1:04:24] battle when your back's against the wall
[1:04:28] get one all hails against you
[1:04:32] and then watch men of god and ladies of
[1:04:34] god stand up and say i'll stand by them
[1:04:37] i'll fight with them
[1:04:41] devil says well i'll just start a rumor
[1:04:47] go ahead devil
[1:04:50] started
[1:04:55] i've had plenty of rumors started
[1:04:57] i'm sure brother ron has whether andrew
[1:04:59] has any minister has
[1:05:01] but you don't let it affect you
[1:05:04] and you don't preach from a standpoint
[1:05:06] of a complex trying to destroy another
[1:05:09] person because that person's not even in
[1:05:11] your congregation nine times out of ten
[1:05:12] so you're never gonna help the people
[1:05:14] sitting there but we didn't come to pass
[1:05:16] somebody else for what they did in the
[1:05:17] past but we come tonight that we might
[1:05:19] identify the body to build you up and to
[1:05:22] give you faith
[1:05:25] to know that no matter what happens
[1:05:29] god's still with you
[1:05:33] and when that pulsation began to happen
[1:05:34] inside of job
[1:05:36] he knew god's voice
[1:05:40] and nobody
[1:05:41] brother nathanael could tell him
[1:05:43] otherwise
[1:05:44] when he saw it when he knew it was the
[1:05:46] voice he'd heard god's voice
[1:05:51] do you think you could have been wrong
[1:05:54] job you think you missed that just a
[1:05:55] little bit
[1:05:58] job said you know what i went a long
[1:05:59] time and i couldn't get the inspiration
[1:06:00] on me but now it's on me
[1:06:02] and i know what it feels like when it
[1:06:03] comes
[1:06:05] and i didn't miss it
[1:06:08] i hit it just right
[1:06:10] and i don't know how long it's going to
[1:06:12] take
[1:06:15] because god didn't say how long it took
[1:06:16] to give him everything back but god said
[1:06:18] he restored everything back
[1:06:20] so it's not image it's immaterial how
[1:06:22] long it takes
[1:06:24] what's the point is is at the end you've
[1:06:26] got it all back
[1:06:30] i don't know how long it's going to be
[1:06:31] before he's able to go out and preach
[1:06:33] conventions four or five knots in a row
[1:06:35] i'm not interested in that what i'm
[1:06:36] interested in is that he makes it there
[1:06:39] and listen when inspiration strikes your
[1:06:41] heart that's all you're concerned with i
[1:06:44] know he's gonna be there
[1:06:46] [Applause]
[1:06:50] that's what we're trusting in
[1:06:52] it's god to get the enemy out of the way
[1:06:56] because they'll accuse you day and night
[1:07:00] they'll ridicule you
[1:07:01] they'll make fun of you
[1:07:03] but let me tell you
[1:07:05] when his best friend come down there and
[1:07:06] begin rebuking him
[1:07:09] inspiration struck him
[1:07:11] nothing could take that out of job's
[1:07:13] heart
[1:07:14] when inspiration finally struck
[1:07:17] brother branham would put it this way
[1:07:19] sometimes these great pulsations of
[1:07:21] faith come right in the time of crises
[1:07:25] right in a time where it's all bleak
[1:07:29] that pulsation of faith has begun to
[1:07:31] rise
[1:07:38] reminds me of the couple they were
[1:07:39] sitting there
[1:07:41] and the nurse had come in and said
[1:07:44] your son's about to die
[1:07:47] looked at the machine
[1:07:50] all the numbers were looking bad
[1:07:52] about that time brother branham walked
[1:07:54] in the room
[1:07:55] brother branham are so glad you're here
[1:07:57] would you pray for her son he gets down
[1:07:59] and begins praying he rises up he said
[1:08:02] well brother branham thank god for
[1:08:04] healing my son
[1:08:08] the nurse said sir you don't understand
[1:08:10] that machine says he's going to die
[1:08:13] and brother brown says or the man tells
[1:08:15] you he said honey you don't understand
[1:08:17] that machine might say he's going to die
[1:08:19] but god has said he's going to live
[1:08:23] and when god says he's going to live
[1:08:25] that's what he was looking at
[1:08:31] you know the rest of the story he went
[1:08:32] home the next day
[1:08:36] well
[1:08:38] completely well
[1:08:43] we find in those real hours of stress
[1:08:45] that's when usually god moves in and
[1:08:47] begins to
[1:08:48] drive back the fire
[1:08:52] at those hebrew children they they got
[1:08:53] right down until they actually stepped
[1:08:56] in the fire
[1:08:59] excuse me it wasn't about they were
[1:09:00] about to get in the fire and he came
[1:09:03] they got in the fire
[1:09:06] and he was there
[1:09:08] see he didn't have to he didn't have to
[1:09:10] i said well i wonder if he'll be there
[1:09:11] no they said we don't know if he'll be
[1:09:12] there but we know where god's able but
[1:09:14] either way o king we're not going to bow
[1:09:16] down and worship your fake god we're not
[1:09:18] going to bow down and worship the god of
[1:09:19] later asea we're not going to bow down
[1:09:21] and worship anything else but we know
[1:09:23] one thing for sure our god is able
[1:09:26] [Applause]
[1:09:31] and brother man puts it like this when
[1:09:33] he moves
[1:09:35] he moves
[1:09:39] when the hebrew children walked in god
[1:09:41] moved
[1:09:43] and the old king goes down and he looks
[1:09:44] and goes hey say
[1:09:46] did we not throw three men in the fire
[1:09:49] yeah
[1:09:51] well there's a fourth one in there that
[1:09:53] looks like how did he know what he
[1:09:55] looked like
[1:09:58] he looks like the son of god
[1:10:02] how did he get in there
[1:10:05] didn't we throw three and we threw three
[1:10:08] we better get them out of there then
[1:10:10] because somebody's in there walking
[1:10:11] around
[1:10:14] they're having a revival
[1:10:16] they're having a holy ghost fit
[1:10:18] however you want to put it there was
[1:10:19] something they went inbound they walked
[1:10:22] out
[1:10:23] delivered
[1:10:24] they were loose from their vines that
[1:10:26] had them
[1:10:28] they went into the trial they went into
[1:10:30] the thing they were down they were
[1:10:32] beaten but they came out of it
[1:10:33] overcomers
[1:10:38] glory to god
[1:10:41] no weapon
[1:10:44] formed against you shall ever prosper
[1:10:47] when the enemy comes in like a flood god
[1:10:48] raises up a standard against it
[1:10:51] roses what is that sin well i'll just
[1:10:53] answer you with this brother madam said

[1:11:17] there was a seed on the earth at that
[1:11:18] time

[1:11:21] but this is a different inspiration
[1:11:24] this is a different time

[1:11:28] this is the time when the bride's coming
[1:11:30] together this is the time when they're

[1:13:38] feeling great
[1:13:41] well jason that might be telling a story
[1:13:44] no it's not
[1:13:46] because i remember the prophet of god
[1:13:48] when he had that stomach condition
[1:13:50] i didn't intend for this to go exactly
[1:13:52] this way but it's not my it's not what i
[1:13:54] intend any house what god wants
[1:13:57] and here here it is and you know god
[1:13:59] knows exactly what's happening and
[1:14:01] brother brandon somebody come ask him
[1:14:03] how you feeling billy i'm healed
[1:14:08] cover it up
[1:14:10] i'm healed puke it up covered up
[1:14:13] puked it up covered it up
[1:14:16] someone said bill you're telling a lie
[1:14:17] he said jesus said he's the high priest
[1:14:20] of your confession
[1:14:21] and if you don't confess it he ain't
[1:14:23] obligated to do it
[1:14:25] you get that much revelation you're on
[1:14:27] the way
[1:14:28] he's the high priest of my confession
[1:14:37] i was a brother tim pritchard a while
[1:14:38] back and
[1:14:40] and we were in the office before i come
[1:14:41] out to preach and brother tim just we
[1:14:44] prayed
[1:14:45] like we usually do the ministers and all
[1:14:47] of a sudden he just grabs a hold of me
[1:14:52] and he says
[1:14:53] you demon of allergies because i've
[1:14:56] suffered with them ever since i was a
[1:14:57] child
[1:14:58] doctor said i'd grow out of them my dad
[1:15:00] goes how old are you going to have to
[1:15:01] get
[1:15:05] so he starts praying for me rebuking
[1:15:07] that devil
[1:15:08] rebuking that devil
[1:15:11] bill jason you're still clearing your
[1:15:12] throat tonight i don't care
[1:15:15] see what you don't understand is channel
[1:15:17] of inspirations came i'm just waiting
[1:15:20] for the fulfillment in this body
[1:15:22] because i know i'm already healed how do
[1:15:24] you know cause somebody done laid hands
[1:15:26] and prayed on me
[1:15:28] and i believed what they prayed
[1:15:31] so therefore i'm waiting for this
[1:15:36] just to finish up
[1:15:40] [Music]
[1:15:42] how you get around me some days you'd
[1:15:44] think i had covered
[1:15:49] one guy asked me cause you sure you're
[1:15:50] okay has i've been this way all my life
[1:15:53] i don't think it's covered
[1:15:56] if it is it's the longest case they've
[1:15:57] ever had in the last two years
[1:16:03] but when you're healed you're healed
[1:16:05] i see nothing can take that from you
[1:16:08] i remember one night i was driving home
[1:16:10] from church and i was sicker than a dog
[1:16:12] man it's been years ago we just got
[1:16:14] married
[1:16:16] we drove home from church that night and
[1:16:18] all of a sudden
[1:16:19] i just started praying i said lord
[1:16:21] i just want to open up moses's medical
[1:16:23] cabinet tonight
[1:16:25] well you said i'm the lord thy god
[1:16:27] that healeth all thy diseases
[1:16:30] and that old sick flu whatever it was
[1:16:33] left me instantly
[1:16:36] it just left
[1:16:37] it was completely gone
[1:16:39] listen when the inspiration strikes
[1:16:42] that's when you gotta move
[1:16:44] inspiration will start praying
[1:16:47] stop quoting the word
[1:16:52] faith began to build
[1:16:56] had a need
[1:16:59] joshua had a need one time he was in an
[1:17:02] hour of crisis was he not he's fighting
[1:17:05] a battle
[1:17:07] all of a sudden he runs out of daylight
[1:17:09] almost he says i ain't gonna get this
[1:17:11] battle done he speaks to the moon he
[1:17:13] speaks to the sun
[1:17:18] and it just stopped
[1:17:23] excuse me brother said i don't know how
[1:17:25] it stopped don't matter how it stopped
[1:17:27] it stopped
[1:17:29] how do you know it stopped the bible
[1:17:30] said it stopped
[1:17:32] and the bible is the inspired word of
[1:17:34] god and therefore i believe it
[1:17:37] so the stun stood still
[1:17:40] it was a paradox
[1:17:42] it was a miracle
[1:17:45] it was something that could not be
[1:17:47] explained
[1:17:48] but he believed it
[1:17:52] there was a need and he believed it and
[1:17:54] when he spoke it he didn't look around
[1:17:56] say well i wonder if that's going to
[1:17:57] happen
[1:17:58] [Music]
[1:18:01] it happened
[1:18:02] there was no question it happened
[1:18:06] and when it happens in your life
[1:18:08] you know it
[1:18:10] when god inspires you for something you
[1:18:13] know it and there ain't no weapon formed
[1:18:15] against you that can never take that out
[1:18:16] of your heart
[1:18:18] there's something down in there brother
[1:18:19] adam says this and i've heard but now i
[1:18:21] see he said the same thing in mark 11 23
[1:18:24] if you say to this mountain
[1:18:27] [Music]
[1:18:29] believe what you've said
[1:18:31] now watch he says but you can't stand
[1:18:33] there and fumble in your mind
[1:18:36] and say it
[1:18:38] you've got to be inspired
[1:18:41] to say it
[1:18:43] and when you're inspired to say it
[1:18:46] it's different
[1:18:50] you could pray for somebody till you're
[1:18:51] blue in the face but all of a sudden
[1:18:53] something could change and you could hit
[1:18:54] that channel of inspiration and you
[1:18:56] could just say
[1:18:57] leave the devil
[1:18:59] ain't gonna scream eddie ain't gonna
[1:19:00] yell leave devil
[1:19:03] he leaves
[1:19:06] pretty simple that's the way it happened
[1:19:09] hattie wright was sitting there in the
[1:19:10] room one time brother was telling a
[1:19:12] story about how the squirrels was
[1:19:14] created
[1:19:15] you remember the story
[1:19:16] and all of a sudden she says brother
[1:19:18] behind him that's nothing but the truth
[1:19:21] wasn't there
[1:19:24] but she believed it
[1:19:30] i wasn't there in brother abraham's
[1:19:32] meetings but i believe it
[1:19:34] i didn't see all the miraculous things
[1:19:36] that he saw there i see what's happening
[1:19:38] now
[1:19:40] and i just have to believe it's the same
[1:19:42] god it's the same inspiration it's the
[1:19:45] same token that's been applied
[1:19:50] it'll do the same thing as it did then
[1:19:54] and for the first time the third pull is
[1:19:55] used upon a woman
[1:20:00] and she says
[1:20:02] that's nothing but the truth and brother
[1:20:04] brahman said hattie
[1:20:06] whatever you ask for
[1:20:10] the lord jesus just told me to tell you
[1:20:12] to give it to you
[1:20:16] he told me to give it to you
[1:20:20] god used a man
[1:20:22] to give it to the lady
[1:20:24] [Applause]
[1:20:26] if you believe word english language you
[1:20:28] have to believe that's what happened
[1:20:31] i'll give it to you
[1:20:33] brother brown what shall i ask for well
[1:20:34] there's your sister she's crippled
[1:20:37] didn't ring a bell
[1:20:40] you make 200 a year on your farm
[1:20:42] you could ask for a million dollars
[1:20:44] i don't know where it would come from
[1:20:46] but it'd be here in the next five
[1:20:47] minutes
[1:20:48] it would immediately appear on the table
[1:20:51] and she said
[1:20:52] i don't want money
[1:20:54] and i don't want something that's
[1:20:56] temporary
[1:20:58] she didn't utter those words maybe but
[1:21:00] that's what was in here
[1:21:02] how do you know brother jason by the
[1:21:03] choice she made
[1:21:06] because the next thing she said i just
[1:21:08] heard the prophet said he was those two
[1:21:09] boys are sitting over there laughing at
[1:21:11] what i was telling
[1:21:16] she looked around she sing those two
[1:21:18] boys brother rem said they were little
[1:21:19] rickies they got out in the world and
[1:21:21] just
[1:21:23] was at that point in time teenager
[1:21:26] he said all of a sudden she looked over
[1:21:28] and she's singing them she said brother
[1:21:29] random i want the salvation of them two
[1:21:31] boys
[1:21:33] huh see two predestinated seeds had a
[1:21:35] need
[1:21:36] and he's the same god so he calls the
[1:21:38] mama to say the right thing
[1:21:41] and she said i want the salvation of
[1:21:42] them two boys he said i
[1:21:45] give them to you
[1:21:46] in the name of jesus christ
[1:21:49] [Applause]
[1:21:52] if you're a bloodball son or daughter of
[1:21:54] god you have the ability to use the word
[1:21:57] let it become inspiration let you say i
[1:21:59] give it to you in the name of jesus
[1:22:02] arise take up your bad walk
[1:22:05] and he said
[1:22:07] i give them to you and immediately they
[1:22:09] fell across their lap
[1:22:12] and repented and was filled with the
[1:22:13] holy ghost
[1:22:19] brother jason i've been seeking the holy
[1:22:20] ghost for 25 years
[1:22:23] well
[1:22:26] the devil is going to trip me yet
[1:22:29] see how you got me when i got on that
[1:22:30] subject
[1:22:32] i've been seeking the holy ghost for 25
[1:22:34] years
[1:22:35] well my question to you is why ain't you
[1:22:37] received it
[1:22:40] well i've been to youth camp i've been
[1:22:41] to family camp and i've been to all
[1:22:42] kinds of camps listen go in the camp
[1:22:44] don't give you the holy ghost you might
[1:22:46] get it at camp and you might get it in
[1:22:48] the church here tonight but the thing
[1:22:50] about us that don't give it to you when
[1:22:52] you have come under total obedience to
[1:22:54] the word of god he entitles you to the
[1:22:58] token
[1:23:00] so if you don't have it you're not in
[1:23:02] total obedience yet
[1:23:04] so the so the prophet said go back and
[1:23:07] repent again
[1:23:12] amen
[1:23:14] most people don't think if i get up and
[1:23:15] repent again what's god going to think
[1:23:17] at the day of judgment
[1:23:19] when he said i sent a little arkansas
[1:23:20] hillbilly
[1:23:22] who stumbled over his words and screams
[1:23:24] and yells and sweats because he's
[1:23:25] nervous
[1:23:26] i don't sweat because i'm
[1:23:28] i don't when i get anointed it don't
[1:23:30] make me sweat
[1:23:31] i sweat when i pick up a tool belt
[1:23:34] i always have it's just the jackson
[1:23:37] thing my little nephew said
[1:23:42] but when inspiration strikes you it's
[1:23:43] over with
[1:23:45] then you grab it and you run this is
[1:23:47] what he said this is what i'm going to
[1:23:48] believe i don't care what anybody else
[1:23:50] says i'm going to believe this message
[1:23:52] because when it became real to me it
[1:23:54] might not have become real to somebody
[1:23:56] else but when it becomes real to you you
[1:23:59] hang on to it
[1:24:00] you'll die for it
[1:24:06] if you ain't willing to die for it
[1:24:11] what's the problem
[1:24:12] why don't you got the holy ghost in
[1:24:15] repent
[1:24:16] be baptized in the name of jesus christ
[1:24:19] and he shall give you the baptism of the
[1:24:21] holy ghost
[1:24:22] [Applause]
[1:24:23] pretty simple prescription but a lot of
[1:24:25] people are looking for something
[1:24:28] i'm looking for lightning to strike me
[1:24:30] i'm looking for a feeling
[1:24:33] come on
[1:24:35] i don't have it cause i ain't had the
[1:24:36] feeling
[1:24:38] when brother biscuit said how do you
[1:24:39] know if you got if you don't have it
[1:24:41] if you've repented and been baptized
[1:24:44] well protesting my desires have changed
[1:24:45] but i don't think i've got it yet excuse
[1:24:47] me
[1:24:48] what changed your desires
[1:24:50] your new spirit didn't change your
[1:24:52] desires
[1:24:54] your new spirit you'd go back to being a
[1:24:55] whoremonger you're going back to being a
[1:24:57] prostitute but once he comes in with the
[1:24:59] holy spirit to agree with a new spirit
[1:25:02] that he gave you there is no losing it
[1:25:06] you can't lose what god has sealed
[1:25:10] [Applause]
[1:25:12] you might shout and dance and run the
[1:25:14] pins benches
[1:25:17] and you might just sit there and cry
[1:25:23] i like it when they're shouting
[1:25:25] but shouting don't mean you're saved
[1:25:28] hey i tell the church all the time you
[1:25:30] think i'm crazy here you wait till i get
[1:25:31] over there
[1:25:34] you wait till i can't cough and pull a
[1:25:35] muscle you know
[1:25:36] you ever did that
[1:25:38] cough
[1:25:45] man i feel old
[1:25:47] but one of these mornings
[1:25:51] that ain't happening no more
[1:25:53] one of these mornings i'm going to be
[1:25:54] changed inspiration's already struck me
[1:25:56] on that i know in whom i have believed
[1:25:59] i've got the same revelation that job
[1:26:00] has i know my redeemer liveth and in
[1:26:03] this flesh shall i see god and him shall
[1:26:06] i see you not another

[1:26:33] ovary
[1:26:36] brother and prayed and prayed and prayed

[1:27:09] and he said you say how to be
[1:27:12] and it'll be just that
[1:27:14] way
[1:27:18] and he said in the morning
[1:27:20] before the doctor's hand when he pulls
[1:27:22] the cover back
[1:27:23] before his hand touches her
[1:27:26] the tumor will be gone
[1:27:29] and you say brother this and that's just
[1:27:30] for brother random i defy that statement
[1:27:33] i've seen it work before i've seen under
[1:27:35] inspiration pray the same thing and god
[1:27:37] did the same thing
[1:27:39] listen god's no respect to person he
[1:27:41] didn't put these things here that we
[1:27:42] would just look at them as history
[1:27:44] but now they got to become life
[1:27:47] [Applause]
[1:27:54] doctor went to touch her couldn't find
[1:27:56] it nowhere looked at the scans couldn't
[1:27:58] even tell which side it was on he said
[1:28:00] meter all i know to tell you it was
[1:28:02] there and now it's gone and there's not
[1:28:05] even a trace of it left in your body
[1:28:09] [Applause]
[1:28:11] [Music]
[1:28:12] when it leaves
[1:28:14] when it leaves
[1:28:16] there ain't gonna be a trace of it any
[1:28:17] longer
[1:28:18] how cause jesus don't halfway do
[1:28:20] something
[1:28:22] god's able to do a complete work
[1:28:26] when it left she was perfect
[1:28:29] there was no surgery scar
[1:28:35] wasn't there
[1:28:37] i remember sister sheila mccomas had
[1:28:39] cancer
[1:28:40] two types of cancer she had female
[1:28:42] cancer she was eat up with it
[1:28:44] she had cancer on her kidney
[1:28:47] she come up wednesday night i think
[1:28:48] thursday or friday with surgery she come
[1:28:50] up wednesday night we prayed for her and
[1:28:52] in my prayer i remember saying before
[1:28:54] the doctor's hands touch i remembered
[1:28:55] that quote and i just quoted it
[1:28:59] and then the day of the surgery brother
[1:29:00] tim pruitt showed up and he was there
[1:29:02] and he prayed the exact
[1:29:04] same thing
[1:29:06] now let everything be established
[1:29:09] in the mouth of two witnesses
[1:29:12] and the doctor cuts her open looking at
[1:29:14] that kidney and he searches for an hour
[1:29:22] he says well
[1:29:24] it ain't there
[1:29:25] he gets another doctor to come in it
[1:29:27] ain't there
[1:29:28] when she comes to in recovery he says

[1:29:34] [Applause]
[1:29:36] much let me tell you something doctor
[1:29:39] get the others on board
[1:29:42] huh cause our lord is able to heal and
[1:29:44] do exceedingly abundantly above all we
[1:29:47] can ever ask or think
[1:29:49] that's the kind of god he is just step
[1:29:51] into that inspiration
[1:30:06] can i have a few more minutes
[1:30:10] thank you
[1:30:11] i figured you'd say that's why i asked
[1:30:18] brother frank mccomas most a lot of you
[1:30:20] know him his mother passed away the
[1:30:21] other day and
[1:30:24] by the way she was a big fan of brother
[1:30:26] ron's
[1:30:28] she'd sit in a mcdonald's restaurant
[1:30:29] across the table from him or at the
[1:30:31] fellowship hall and just
[1:30:32] chit chat with him testifying to him
[1:30:39] powerful woman
[1:30:41] powerful
[1:30:43] back in 1964 though she had a wreck i
[1:30:45] believe it was and she became paralyzed
[1:30:48] she couldn't walk
[1:30:51] and they got a hold of brother behind
[1:30:52] him
[1:30:53] and he prayed for her over the phone
[1:30:55] and he told her he said marie
[1:30:58] in the morning
[1:30:59] get out of bed and fix your husband and
[1:31:01] them children breakfast before they go
[1:31:03] to school
[1:31:04] yeah she said okay brother
[1:31:08] she wakes up the next morning
[1:31:10] her feet still don't move
[1:31:13] her husband goes what are you going to
[1:31:14] do
[1:31:15] she goes you're going to take my feet
[1:31:17] and swing them over out of the bed
[1:31:20] inspiration doesn't struck her you're
[1:31:22] going to take my feet and swing them
[1:31:24] over out of the bed and when he swung
[1:31:25] her feet over out of the bed she stood
[1:31:27] up
[1:31:29] hallelujah and she walked since 1964 to
[1:31:32] this year until the lord took her home
[1:31:35] let me tell you that same lord jesus is
[1:31:38] here today
[1:31:49] she went blind one time and they sent
[1:31:51] work to brother brown he was up in the
[1:31:52] mountains he got the word
[1:31:54] and she's laying in a hospital room
[1:31:56] blind as a bat couldn't see nothing
[1:31:59] and she said all of a sudden that pillar
[1:32:01] of fire came in the room
[1:32:03] and opened her eyes up
[1:32:05] and come right over her eyes
[1:32:08] and opened them
[1:32:10] and when brother branham calls back
[1:32:12] she tells him what happened and he said
[1:32:14] what time was that she said two o'clock
[1:32:16] he said i was in the mountain praying
[1:32:18] for you at that time
[1:32:22] see god knows how to do it
[1:32:24] when inspiration strikes you like that
[1:32:26] there ain't no going back
[1:32:28] what about the inspiration that struck
[1:32:30] that little woman up in the balcony
[1:32:34] lady holding the baby up her crying is
[1:32:35] all fidgety
[1:32:36] and she said you know
[1:32:38] what she said
[1:32:41] something said pray for that baby
[1:32:43] she said well
[1:32:44] she's got a prayer card i don't want to
[1:32:46] pray for the holy spirit kept saying
[1:32:48] pray for the baby
[1:32:50] she said i'll give her my seat maybe
[1:32:51] that'll make me feel better
[1:32:53] so she gave her a seat
[1:32:55] something kept saying pray for the baby
[1:32:58] she said ma'am i know you're going in a
[1:33:00] prayer line a few minutes but do you
[1:33:01] mind if i pray for that baby she said
[1:33:03] absolutely not
[1:33:06] she comes through the prayer line and
[1:33:07] under discernment brother brown tells
[1:33:08] her who she is
[1:33:10] and all about her and says and your
[1:33:11] baby's already healed by the way
[1:33:14] because the holy spirit spoke to that
[1:33:16] little lady up there and told her to lay
[1:33:18] hands on your child brother said see
[1:33:20] she'd have more compassion on that baby
[1:33:22] than i would have
[1:33:24] because she was a mother
[1:33:28] god can use you
[1:33:29] [Applause]
[1:33:32] let me just say this tonight if god ever
[1:33:33] speaks to your heart to pray for someone
[1:33:36] pray
[1:33:38] pray
[1:33:41] i remember one day i was sitting at the
[1:33:42] house and
[1:33:45] my brother used to come to church
[1:33:46] therefore he passed away but he wasn't
[1:33:48] coming at the time
[1:33:49] and he was in the hospital in dallas
[1:33:51] fort worth texas really sick about to
[1:33:53] look like he was about to die anyhow
[1:33:55] and i called his son up who lived there
[1:33:57] by us and went to church and said what
[1:33:58] are you doing tomorrow he goes nothing i
[1:33:59] said let's go to dallas and pray for
[1:34:01] your daddy
[1:34:02] and saint this ain't nothing i done
[1:34:05] i just followed what he told me
[1:34:07] see when he spoke it to my heart all i
[1:34:08] knew to do was do it
[1:34:10] we walked into the hospital he was as
[1:34:12] wide as those walls and all of a sudden
[1:34:14] a big smile come across his face we laid
[1:34:16] hands on him and prayed for him god
[1:34:18] resurrected him out of the hospital and
[1:34:20] within a short time he was home
[1:34:23] but while we were there he said brother
[1:34:24] jason my wife's had a blood issue for
[1:34:26] years
[1:34:28] remember her too
[1:34:30] while you're here would you just pray
[1:34:32] for her
[1:34:34] and we prayed for her
[1:34:36] we come home
[1:34:38] and in just a couple of months he moved
[1:34:40] up
[1:34:41] started going to church with us
[1:34:43] and in a year's time his wife's blood
[1:34:46] issue left
[1:34:47] but it didn't happen overnight
[1:34:49] but just well that's not if god were
[1:34:51] done he had done it overnight god moves
[1:34:53] in his own way
[1:34:54] you can't put a time limit on god when
[1:34:56] god said she was healed she was healed
[1:34:59] where did he say that in his word
[1:35:03] by his stripes
[1:35:05] you are already healed
[1:35:08] all you've got to do is catch the
[1:35:09] inspiration
[1:35:11] and step into it
[1:35:16] when it happens you'll know it
[1:35:20] when god reveals it to you you know it
[1:35:22] nobody can take it from you it's right
[1:35:25] here
[1:35:27] it's done sunk right down in here and it
[1:35:29] ain't going nowhere i don't care what
[1:35:31] anybody says and ain't leaving
[1:35:34] when god showed you this message you
[1:35:36] didn't turn back from it
[1:35:38] you're still here i mean i remember when
[1:35:40] y'all started it been a long time ago
[1:35:42] now you're still here
[1:35:45] because that's how god moves
[1:35:47] roses but don't some of us have troubles
[1:35:49] and trials and yeah but when inspiration
[1:35:52] strikes you rise up out of it
[1:35:54] i might have been stuck down there but
[1:35:56] something struck me one sunday or one
[1:35:58] saturday and i rose up out of the pit
[1:36:00] that i was in and i got back on the way

[1:36:50] a system mentality of it
[1:36:53] you had the bible before you came to
[1:36:55] this message but when you saw the
[1:36:56] message it changed the bible to you
[1:36:59] you know what it made it a brand new
[1:37:01] book to you you didn't read it from an
[1:37:03] old standpoint anymore you didn't read
[1:37:04] it as a book of laws of do's and don'ts

[1:39:54] everyone when the maniac challenged him
[1:39:59] and he fell across brother on his feet
[1:40:00] you remember pinning him to the floor
[1:40:03] brother branham said when that chief
[1:40:04] demon
[1:40:06] of the tribe was conquered
[1:40:09] now that man still going back and took
[1:40:10] that spirit back because he worshipped
[1:40:12] it but he was conquered at that moment
[1:40:15] in that meeting he had no more control
[1:40:18] over that service at that time
[1:40:20] and when he was conquered all the rest
[1:40:23] of them he was the chief
[1:40:24] all the rest of them in that
[1:40:26] congregation was conquered also and he
[1:40:29] said people began shouting standing up
[1:40:31] wheelchairs spots stretchers they threw
[1:40:33] away their walkers
[1:40:37] because they stepped into the
[1:40:38] inspiration
[1:40:41] let us do the same
[1:40:44] because there ain't no grave
[1:40:46] i'm gonna cry there ain't no grave gonna
[1:40:48] hold this body down

[1:41:03] you believe
[1:41:04] there ain't a person in here too old
[1:41:06] tonight that what couldn't see the lord
[1:41:07] jesus coming in the power of glory and
[1:41:09] that one couldn't receive a brand new
[1:41:11] body even standing here tonight they're
[1:41:13] gonna say i don't know when he's coming
[1:41:14] but i know he's coming
[1:41:18] and when he comes

[1:41:32] just play something with this
[1:41:34] we may have battle scars
[1:41:36] and we may be wounded some of us
[1:41:40] but he didn't promise
