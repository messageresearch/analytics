Faithful over a few things I will make thee ruler over many things enter thou into the joy of the Lord Matthew Chapter 5 and verse 13 Jesus is saying this 2,000 years ago and and I'm going to repeat it to you ye are the salt of the earth but if the salt has lost its saber wherewith shall it be salted St forth good for nothing but to be cast out and to be trodden under the foot of men ye are the light of the world a city that is set upon a hill and cannot be hid neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a candlestick and giveth light unto all that are in the house let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven God bless you you may be seated tonight amen so good to see each and every one of you brother bam made some statements about you as a bride of Jesus Christ and you know he was here in our area and um only just a few of us was able to be there I wasn't able to be there but he preached some incredible sermons here in our area sometimes it's like sewing seeds and it takes a while for those seeds to come up oh how he would love to come to this church and preach that series that he preached here and preach it in this day to real Believers and it's more than books and it's more than tapes and it's more than than even it's more than even just theories of doctrines but we're the Bride of Jesus Christ not because we think that it's because he thought that you remember he made some statements about the Bride of Jesus Christ he called them an an invincible Army that's right you're absolutely Invincible the world uh Satan don't have anything that will defeat you he has a lot of things that will bother your flesh and bother your spirit but that genan seed of God that he put on the inside of you it's Eternal it's Eternal and you remember it wasn't you that made the choice are you with me now well well you say well brother Ron I made a choice let me just say this to you your choices was taking you away from God but God before the foundational world put a seed on the inside of you sure he for knew and and sure he elected you but he chose you to be the final voice to the final age that's more than just a statement that's more than just a statement so Satan in his job that when he when he knows that he's got to combat you you know we made a statement last week about brother brandham and the pillar of fire over top of him and it was it was it was actually Vindicated by even the FBI FBI people and written out that it was a supernatural photo but if Satan could give testimony tonight brother Doug he would say that there's a light about every one of you cuz that's how he knows you are who you are are you with me I was at a filling station one day and and I was I was I was pumping gas and it was actually near Rono I was pumping Fuel and into my vehicle and and I saw a real nice couple standing over the side and maybe in their early 70s and they were standing looking my direction and and I just after I got done I moved my vehicle and I I stepped up on the sidewalk and they they were standing there and I I asked them I said you're having a good day and yes we are we want to meet you and so I just stood and talked to him and he had had been in the military most of his life a retired man traveling down from Maryland to come through and and you know and uh as he was as he was going through I said what's the interest with me and he said well we've always heard that there's people have a light and said we see the light on you amen you know you may not see it but somebody sees it and so I went in and we talked for a few minutes I went in and I I went to the washroom and and he went with me well I noticed he he didn't use the washroom that's noticeable you know I came out and I I got a cup of coffee and and uh you know he just stood with me and and then uh I paid for the coffee I offered him one and he said no I I don't care for one and his wife was standing there kind of with him and I I walked out on the porch and he walked out and I said is everything okay he said I want to spend as much time with you as I could you may never see it but people are watching your life now I want to tell you real quickly I'm not saying that to make anything of me but whether you're conscious of it or not conscious of of it as Believers of the word that light's following you sir and we may live in total darkness as it is brother random couldn't see past 1977 we're long way past 1977 how many of you were born after 77 bunch of kids here and so and so you see you were born in darkness literally and God predestinated you that you were born in the darkness but you remember brother random couldn't see past it but if you remember when those when those when that light came down and it went total dark God allowed him a little bit to draw light in that's right it's because of you that he he draw light in because as the scripture says that you're the light of the world now now let me say it will do you no good to try out a flashlight when the sun is shining but if you go out in the middle of the night you'll know how powerful that flashlight is now you could take a candle and light it out in the middle of a day and and you know it won't mean a whole lot standing out in the sunlight but you put it in a very black night so God knew exactly where to put you as beacons of light are you getting where I'm going here with you now let me just say sure we've got challenges this is an age that's unfit to live in that's right it's a horrible immoral age the leaders have completely fell apart our governments has fell apart and our you know even our school systems seem tainted and your jobs every one of you got a complaint on your job even if you work for yourself brother Jim you're working for me now I'm sure you're com work have a complaint with your boss but she's sitting beside of you so don't complain too much you thought I was going to sa myself I ain't throwing myself under no bus tonight but I want you to understand God knew all the challenges that you would have and it's Satan's biggest challenge to get you out of your position to get you to a spot to where you don't recognize who you really are you see in darkness many times people are afraid of the dark I'm sure in different stages of your life you've been scared of the dark and it and it has some incredible challenges to it but let me just say let the light come on brother bam would preach a sermon on on the light he said there's a man here right that can turn on the light I'm thankful that we can come to church and many times we feel so vulnerable and we feel so weak when we walk in and we just say a serm we say a words like this God I need something special from you and all of a sudden a song Will Be Sung or somebody will have a word and this sermon will come right down your alley and maybe even to the point you say who told that but God knows exactly what you're going through and yet we're built here to overcome this age we're not overcoming Luther or Wesley or even Aza Street we're we're the Bride of Jesus Christ to overcome this age so if you're in school God don't have to put 100 people around you to be crutches for you if you're on your job are you with me follow with me even in your marriage let your home be an overcoming home keep God number one in your life I want you to always remember God is with us and that means more than just church right he's with you in your car he's with you in your home he's with you everywhere you go so don't go nowhere that you wouldn't want Jesus to go with you I hear brother brandom said he got in the car and he has going to make a trip down to preach and he said the devil got in the car with him he said well as long as you're in here I'm going to sing to you so if you feel that cold clammy hand come on inside of trying to get in your home just go ahead and start singing to him start quoting some scriptures to him because remember that flow is coming from that seed that you have fed yeah are you with me now remember to keep yourself fed cuz you'll get weak if you don't because malnutrition is more than just for your flesh you got to eat the spiritual word every day that's why devotions are important in your home that's why prayer is important are you with me that's why listen to the tapes in your home is important that you hear the word of the Lord because it's feeding that seed that's right are you with me now now remember God knows what he deposited so he knows what to expect I know you don't look at yourself this way but God has a vision for you to overcome amen I want you to go ahead and say that God has a vision for me to overcome amen so when the enemy Whispers In Your Ear you can't make it he's a liar I want to drive that point just for a moment cuz so many times we have pity parties and we wrestle and we we get up and down and we get depressed a Christian should never be depressed are you with me I know you're going to fight the Blues Brother random fought the blues but listen don't stay there amen don't stay there are you with me now Psalms chapter 91 is my favorite scriptures and I want to read some of these things to you he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty Hallelujah I will say of the Lord he is my refuge and my Fortress my God in him will I trust surely he yes shall deliver the thee From The Snare of the Fowler and from the noise and pestilence he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wing shalt thou trust and and his truth shall be thy shield and buckler Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor the arrow that fth by day nor the pestilence that walketh in darkness nor the destruction that wasteth that Noonday A thousand shall fall all at thy side and 10,000 at the right hand but it shall not come n thee Only With Thine Eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked because thou Hast made the Lord which is my refuge even the most high thy habitation there shall no evil befall thee neither shall any plague come now thy dwelling now notice these next words for he shall give his angels charge over thee now remember the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord to keep thee in all thy ways now remember the scripture says in Hebrews chapter 13 and verse 8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and [Applause] [Music] forever are you with me listen he never loses any of his power he is always the same well brother Ron if I'd have lived 30 years ago if ID have lived 50 years ago if I'd have been in this situation or that situation you're in the spot the where God wants you to be so you're God's Bride on display and the scripture said that these signs shall follow them that believe so your God signed Masterpiece yes sir living in this day are you with me now brother Ron but I've had some trials don't you understand that every trial that you go through prepares you for the next trial that you'll go through I'm glad that's over we get ready baby do suck it up buttercup the next wave is coming and the faith that got you through that will make you stronger for the trial that lays ahead of you listen we're standing on Holy Ground that's not just for Moses standing there that's not just for Elijah in a cave that's not Just for Jesus standing standing preaching the Beatitudes that's not just for brother Brandon with a sword in his hand you are standing on Holy Ground today cuz God prepared this moment for you are you with me now I I listen I I've been around the message since I was a little child but one day I met the god of the message so the message m is more than doctrines you say well brother r i don't understand everything neither do I I don't know all the answers to the questions that's right Lord did I here we're not supposed to know all the answers to the question but I know one that does all of us hate to be around and know it all but the know it all is only to trying to convince himself that he knows it all and if you stay around him long enough you'll figure out he don't know at all can you imagine being there when that fish came back to life can you imagine being there when that that that that ruler is struck exactly 42 Ines silver trip drops to the bottom or even brother Brand's standing there and he's he's got the picture of the cloud in his hands and and he's asking even other brothers that are very close to him you know what does all this mean they're giving him answers and the angel tells him to turn it right Hallelujah and he sees the Lord there listen if we we could just turn the picture of ourselves right we could see God living in our [Music] lives are you with me now now remember remember this that you are literally the blood cell of Jesus Christ that's right you see his seed is actually what makes us so important that's right there was a girl named Rahab now let me just say this to you she believed the word she was anchored in the word she believed the token and she was spared but the reason that she's written in Matthew chapter 1 as the mothers of Christ is because the seed that she received and it placed her in the lineage of Jesus Christ so the seed that went inside of her womb was the important part the seed that lays on the inside of you is the important part are you with me now what got you here that seed what keeps you here that seed there's moments in your flesh that you'll feel like I quit I can't take it anymore are you with me how many's ever came to that spot in your life your flesh I'm talking about your flesh I'm not talking about your soul here but your flesh said I've had enough I I'm going to put both hands up but you couldn't quit if you wanted to there's no quit on the inside of that seed because you're not the one that's holding on to start off with it's him that's holding on to you listen if you can give up and you can walk away you didn't have the seed to start off [Applause] with are you with me brother R taught us about that one drop of ink and drops it into the Clorox you know sometimes he's a scientist and he said you can drop a a drop of ink into a bucket of Clorox and he said and it breaks it down even to the point that you can't find the ink anymore so the enemy will constantly take you through the chapters before you came to Christ ain't that incredible yeah or you'll point you to the mistakes that you've you've you but he don't tell you when you got back up that's right he don't remind you oh yeah but he got you back up he only points you to the failure or somebody else's failure but if the truth of the matter be told God cannot even see your sins himself go ahead and give the Lord a great big hand now notice this quote brother BR says all powers in Heaven and Earth is given into my hand go and I'll go with you whatever you bind on Earth I'll bind in heaven and whatever you loose on Earth I'll loosen heaven now listen he don't just leave it there if the great holy church only realized its power to do these things but there's so much doubt and fear and trembling Wonder Could it happen as long as that exists the church can never stand upright when every talk of fear is vanished and the Holy Spirit is completely in control of the church then all fears are gone and the church has the power the church has the power we why they have everything that heaven owns behind them they're ambassadors of the throne absolutely an ambassador of Christ has the authority everything that Christ owns belongs to that Ambassador are you with me don't never let it to become void to you brother man said when you get saved get the Holy Ghost God gives you a checkbook on that's right all you got to do is fill it out now Satan watches he watches this message he watches it goes forth because it exposes him right and we're not just a church we're not just a group of a body of Believers coming together for a for a reunion every weekend but we leave the house of the the Lord yes sir and we have strong homes we have strong children amen amen don't forget how powerful that you really are you have strong businesses and you're operating in complete Blackness and darkness to which Satan swore that you wouldn't be able to do it and he throws everything at you to try to keep you from next weekend service and you just simply show up that's right so you're being here are you with me Satan has thrw thousands of demons against you this week whether you can see it or whether you could feel it you still are here Hall are you with me God is vindicating his word living on the inside of you and Satan is right near you fighting you every step of the way actually he's proving you are who you are go ahead say it with me Satan is proven I am who I am as our sister in Florida has passed on it's going to take a stronger win than this Hallelujah Paul said it like this in second Timothy chap 4 and verse 6 for I am now ready for I'm now ready to be offered and my time of departure is at hand I have fought a good fight even getting ready to have his head cut off he writes some of the most powerful scriptures that you can that will be read by millions of people I have fought a good fight I have finished my course I have kept the faith there's no pity party in that scripture there's no feel sorry for me in that scripture oh I'm in a really bad spot here listen in an hour or so he's going to die they're sharpening brother B said they're sharpening the the the the axe that's going to cut his head off and he writes the scripture let's read it together I have fought a good fight I have finished my course I have kept the faith that makes you want to run notice the scripture henceforth there is laid up a for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not me only and not me only but into

this weight cuz he handed me a coat that that I I've been wanting for a long time and he and he handed me this coat and I put it on and it fit now whether I was going to get it was all hinged on the fitting that's right if it didn't fit me it was going to go to somebody else's Christmas present I know I know but it fit so it's my coat amen my coat I'm happy with that coat you know this message fits like the fell said you know he called me an eagle and the other guy complained he called me a baset and call me a chicken but he called me an eagle I like it this message ain't for everybody hey

works of the Lord the Lord hath chasen me sore but he hath not given me over unto death Luke 1 and verse 37 Hallelujah I want you to read with me for with God nothing impossible brother Ron but it looks import impossible you haven't read the Final Chapter that's right you may be in a tough spot in chapter three but wait till chapter five comes up I just made up numbers don't don't try to get doctrinally right there on me Sarah nothing shall be impossible little bride nothing shall be impossible first John chapter 4 and verse 4 ye are of God Little Children remember I came from God I'm going back to God God knew what day you'd be born what day you would leave naked you came into the world naked you'll leave brother H Homer's uncle said everybody else was born naked but I was born in a three-piece suit ye have God little children and have overcame them Satan's throw everything at you and you're still standing but brother Ron I haven't did anything Supernatural I I I haven't laid the hands on the sick none of them I I don't know of anybody that's got healed or I I haven't seen an angel I you know I come to church I feel that presence you're standing give yourself some credit you're still standing brother Ron but you know I'm a nobody you're listening to the wrong person here you're listening wrong person God elected you before the foundation of the world April he did you you didn't be wasn't raised fatherless you had to put up with a guy like me come on are you with me and your father's been watching across the balcony for a long time and he not in a dead body he's he's more alive than you are are you get are you getting the point [Music] here brother John said see me after church and I'm not going to I got something for for you but let me just say this you didn't know nothing about this message when you walked in that's I don't even want to know your past it's not [Applause] important it's not important but when we sat across a table from one another at that long table and them young bodies cuz we're the same age let me just say this you we'll go by his grace so Satan has thrw everything at you and you overcame it how did you do it greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world ain't that incredible I find it incredible tonight that brother Meadow sits here and he finishes my statement or my scriptures and he don't know what he had for breakfast this morning it proves to you that the seed hoes I was in brother I was in went to see brother Bill and he was in tough shape he was talking a lot of nonsense and all all that kind of stuff and you know in all of his nonsense that he was talking sister Lyon you guys did such a good job with him he was just talking all kind of nonsense and and uh somehow we come across I'm not going to tell you how but somehow we come across that I have cancer he grabbed my head and prayed one of the most beautiful prayers that I've ever heard prayed when he said amen he went right back to his nonsense are you with me it shows you that the seed holds aren't you glad of that when you can't hold yourself oh I feel like shouting right now when you can't hold yourself that seed that's on the inside of you Romans chapter 8 and verse 28 told you and we know all things let's all read it together I got one guy's going to read it with me and we know all things work gather for them sorry I'm having an emotional moment right there one night when I was preaching brother metas preached a sermon from his Pew because I miss the the who are the called because that's incredibly important cuz you didn't call yourself and there's a lot of people that can use that scripture and hold it that will never know anything about the message but you are the called according to his his that's a really big statement right there his not mine or my wife or my neighbors it's not my ambition that's important it's his brother Brandon wanted to be a Trapper in the end of his life that wasn't what God God actually told him I'll leave you right I don't have to tell you a half an hour story God actually told Brother Brian I'm a prophet of the Lord you carry out your plans aren't you glad that God has a stop switch and says all right all right brother B one time said God you owe me apology because somebody died he said you owe me apology he said God left me like an orphan child for 6 months that's right that's right hard to fine but it's there he continued preaching he continued laying hands on the sick continued seeing a lot of things and he God literally listen you know when you know how can I best describe that it's kind of like you come into service and you just kind of take it for granted that the anointing and that warm presence is always there and then it leaves for six months well maybe that didn't get it it's kind of like be kind of like being married and you don't know what you did you don't know what you did how you did it you don't know how to fix it all you know is be a good boy your amens ought to be better than that you know what I'm talking about you guys live here brother Ron that's real carnal is it brother Bron said I walked in and I could tell she was all nervous and said I put on an apron and I started washing dishes with her and brother Bram said I started singing and after a while he broke the chill sometimes you just got to move in to the spirit of the Lord I don't know why I'm feeling so backslid in my spirit I don't know why I'm not feel just keep pressing amen what was the result of brother brandham he said he said you he said Lord you don't have to owe me no answer cuz he found out that she would have drowned months before that but God spared her life then to get her ready [Music] Amen brother Lloyd walls is our our buddy he was redoing his church and had a lot of work to do and there was a guy came into his church didn't know his background didn't know what was going on brother Jim you might have know this guy came into the church he big sort of fellow did a lot of work there did a lot of work became his buddy right there with him every day and after the work was done the Lord took him home God will send people in your life for a season for a season he will put people in your life to let you know you're not alone for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn of among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate then he also called and whom he called then he also Justified what does justification mean as though you never did it in the first place do do you believe that I'm I'm All honest I'm just down home preaching to you as an audience now do you believe what I just read to you then quit beating yourself up we're not Catholics here we don't do penants when God forgives you of something it's like he pays the credit card off it's done it's over with don't give your right to go put 25,000 more on it whom he justified them he also glorified now let me just say this you this is a past tense scripture this is the way God sees it this was written before you ever got here brother Ray so he predestinated you and now you're here that's right you're the image of what he took a picture of you before the foundation of the world he called you he got you here amen and he justified you no doubt every devil in hell wants to point out different things in your life but God don't see none of it and whom he justified then he also glorified so he's judged you and said well done now listen this night ought to prove to you it's not you it's not you that's holding on he's already seen it finished brother Ron this is so simple really really really is it is it what shall we then say to these things I love this part this is my favorite part if God be for us who can be against us so I want to say this to you and you I want you to say it with me never never never never give up never forget who you are brother Brown talks about Amnesia and I'll finish with this we'll start over in the morning brother Frasier's favorite sermon was spiritual Amnesia brother bran preached it to the Pentecostal church that's where he preached it to because they forgot who they were as long as they was in those old dimly dimly lit buildings and the fire of God was with them that was a real move of God that was with them but here's what Satan does to you before long the rich started coming in I got quotes for it the rich started coming in and they didn't want to take them to those dimly lit buildings so they they built Cathedrals and then they they didn't want that old guy spitting and Hawking and and they didn't want all that emotion so they they got educated preachers and and before long the spirit of God wasn't there no more and kabot was written over the door they forgot who they were the name change was the same but now they were worse than the Catholic church that's right dear God don't let that happen to us I like nice things but don't let that happen to us I don't care if you live in a ten or you live in a castle I want the spirit of God [Applause] brother BR begins to talk about the shock of War even in Israel some of those those hostages now are going to have to be re rehabilitated the children the stories that are coming out day by day it's heartbreaking what they did to those children how they tortured them did things to them listen the devil do a lot of things to you if he could get his hands on you and they're getting them they're getting some of them out and they went back to fighting today but they're getting some of them out but those that they got out now has to battle in their minds of what happened war is horrible it's I hate War amen I hate the battle that you have to fight I hear your battles and I think oh dear God but listen God gave you the strength to get through it everyone sitting in this building's got a different battle every one of you's got a different battle but God's got plans for every one of you to [Music] overcome brother man says these Soldier Boys had had got amnesia because of the war they forgot who they was and who their family was and where they came from so what they would do is put them on a train and they would take them away to an asylum to take care of them for the rest of their life it was old trains and brother Ram's telling this from history it was old trains and and they would need water to to keep the train going you would know the story probably better than I would but they would they would get to a certain spot they needed more water and so it was at those spots they would uh the train would stop and they would get off and I actually held your statue in my hand today I thought as I was thinking about this story and they got off and they'd let him walk around a little bit they didn't know who they were soldiers guards were standing there to to protect them kind of like you sometimes there's an angel standing watching over you and you forgot who you are kind of lost your way the battles of life has got tough Hey listen Cancer's a real deal trouble is a real deal there's times that you kind of lose your way and this one guy started walking so instead of stopping him the angel or the guard just let him keep walking and he walked and he walked up on the hill and he looked at a water tower and that water tower had got familiar to him amen something about it so he just kept walking on his path just kept walking important thing is you just keep walking am amen and walking requires strength to get one step in front of another there's going to be times in your life and I know this for a fact there's going to be times in your life where you have to tell your foot to keep moving cuz the moment you sat down you're done and the angel the guard was walking behind him and he walked up over a hill kept following the path and he walked up over another here and you hear Brother Bram how he says it walks up over another pill and said he comes up over and there's a cabin down sitting in the valley and said there's some smoke coming up from it as it's coming up there's a little picked fence that's around it and he sees an old man standing on the porch amen and he walks down and he comes to that gate and that old man said my son amen no doubt of many a day he thought he' died in war my son welome home am hallah you notice the angel didn't stop him or take him back to the train this is one of the success stories that he could write about and tell about sure there's hundreds on the train that's going to be battling they're going to spend the rest but there's a few that are going to come to themselves they're going to come to themselves you may be a prodal in the H pin but you're going to come to yourself Hallelujah you're going to make your journey you're going to T start taking step after step what I stand here with you welcome home [Applause] hallelujah oh Hallelujah Connie there's a lot of things I'll forget in my life but there's one thing I'll never forget was looking down a prayer line and seeing you making your way down the aisle I never forget that you remember what I did I took my coat off and I put it around you brother Greg I you know sometimes things happen and I don't even even understand why'd you do that why'd you do that I went home and I actually prayed did I did I do anything out of order did I do anything out of order you'll never I'll never forget this he spoke to him and said I put my robe on you I'd like to say it as we end this service brother Denny it was a right night to bring a coat cuz God put his robe on you he put his dress wear on you the wedding gown on you and it fits how many brides in here had wedding gowns that
