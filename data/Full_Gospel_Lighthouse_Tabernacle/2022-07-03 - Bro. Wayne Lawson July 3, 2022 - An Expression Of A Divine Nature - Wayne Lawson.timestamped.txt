[23:04] that family and that church there how
[23:07] many would have an unspoken request
[23:08] you'd like to lift up to the lord this
[23:10] morning we know god can meet and see
[23:13] each and every one of these requests
[23:14] this morning my ass brother gabriel
[23:16] spencer if he would just come
[23:18] lead us to the throne of grace this
[23:19] morning
[23:27] just gonna give a quick testimony just
[23:29] make it short
[23:31] just two weeks ago
[23:32] i was doing my job just as i normally
[23:34] would and when i took the job i knew i
[23:36] was going to be in dangers and
[23:39] between the people i'd come in contact
[23:40] with but regular traffic
[23:42] and as i stopped the truck you came
[23:44] close happens all the time they pull on
[23:46] the white line you can't they can't get
[23:47] over this driver could have gotten over
[23:49] but he stopped in the white line i went
[23:51] up
[23:52] and was going to tell him just to move
[23:53] up onto the shoulder and as i was
[23:55] walking back to my vehicle
[23:57] traffic was pretty heavy that day and
[23:59] two tractor trailers they ended up
[24:00] wrecking right beside me in the in the
[24:02] two lanes right beside me
[24:04] and the truck in the left lane that got
[24:06] hit
[24:07] um locks it up in the left lane which
[24:09] caused all the other traffic to come to
[24:10] a halt stop
[24:12] and as they came to that stop there was
[24:14] a tractor-trailer that went right by me
[24:16] in the right lane i'm standing on the
[24:18] rumble strips of the interstate that
[24:19] tractor trailer goes right by and as it
[24:21] goes by there's a fedex tractor trailer
[24:23] that
[24:24] he turned from the left lane to shoot to
[24:26] the shoulder well the problem was if
[24:27] he's going to the shoulder that's
[24:29] exactly where i'm standing at
[24:31] so as i see it coming i turn and i see
[24:33] him start to jackknife and i've seen
[24:35] plenty of these wrecks enough the
[24:36] trailer ends up flipping and coming into
[24:38] the end of the truck and it just ends up
[24:40] being a massive accident and so i just
[24:42] turned i didn't run i didn't i didn't
[24:44] cry out for help at the time i knew god
[24:46] he sends his angels around us at all
[24:48] times even when we don't have a chance
[24:50] to cry out to him and
[24:53] so i just turned i said well this is it
[24:55] this is it
[24:57] and i turned and just started walking
[24:58] away that way i didn't get hit hit head
[25:01] on in my face i'd take it in the back
[25:03] and so as i started walking forward i
[25:05] got about 10 feet from that the front of
[25:08] the truck i was out with to get around
[25:09] to the other side and that
[25:11] tractor-trailer laid black marks down
[25:13] right in front
[25:14] of the tractor trailer i was out with
[25:16] and if i would have took off running
[25:17] that truck would hit me as i'm trying to
[25:19] round the other truck but god kept me
[25:22] safe so if you end up seeing me act a
[25:24] little crazy as some may say you know
[25:26] why you may say well what's going on
[25:28] with these other people they didn't face
[25:29] a life a life ex death experience well
[25:33] what you're seeing is people who've lost
[25:34] chains chains and they realize that that
[25:37] they don't they don't have to fear that
[25:39] second death because god's came and
[25:41] changed their life and they're just
[25:42] breaking forth in a miriam dance as she
[25:45] turned around and she saw all her
[25:47] enemies drown it in the red sea
[25:49] so
[25:50] if you would just take each and every
[25:51] one of these needs in prayer
[25:53] and if you need something if there's a
[25:55] unspoken prayer request that you need
[25:57] that you haven't spoken out just know
[25:58] that god's right there with you you
[26:00] don't have to speak it to anybody you
[26:02] can speak it directly to your heart
[26:03] because we have one way direction one we
[26:06] can speak directly to jesus christ
[26:08] himself
[26:11] gracious heavenly father lord i just ask
[26:13] you to just come down in this service we
[26:15] thank you for coming and being with us
[26:17] last night you anointed the speaker in a
[26:19] mighty way that he could just speak
[26:21] directly to our needs
[26:22] and we know that we can come directly to
[26:24] you with each and every need that we
[26:26] have inside of our heart lord jesus
[26:28] because you have came down and you are a
[26:30] kinsmen redeemer and we know that you
[26:32] came and if there was if you didn't come
[26:34] we would
[26:34] there'd be no other way for us to be
[26:36] saved we cannot save ourselves we cannot
[26:38] heal ourselves but we can come and speak
[26:41] directly to you lord and i just ask that
[26:44] as as these prayer requests are spoken
[26:45] forth i just ask that you will just come
[26:48] down and be the comforter we see brother
[26:50] ray erickson's church there and the loss
[26:52] of loved ones all around and it seems if
[26:54] it's almost every other day or every
[26:56] other week there's something else
[26:58] drastically happening in a tragedy lord
[27:00] jesus but
[27:01] you we know that everything happens for
[27:03] the good and the glory of you lord and
[27:05] we just give everything unto you and we
[27:06] just ask that you will send that
[27:08] comforter to them in these moments we
[27:10] don't have all the answers we don't ask
[27:12] for all the answers because we know that
[27:14] we are just leaning and trusting on you
[27:16] to bring us bring us that comforter and
[27:18] come to us just as you said you would
[27:20] and as we see here these needs come
[27:22] across the pulpit lord we see that demon
[27:25] of cancer as he tries to rise up and one
[27:27] other person one week and then another
[27:29] person in the next week lord jesus we
[27:31] know that that's just satan anointing
[27:32] the cells within side of our body that
[27:35] that they would just die and they would
[27:36] continue to grow and grow until it
[27:38] becomes a life issue a life that and
[27:41] sometimes doctors don't know what to do
[27:42] with that thing but lord jesus we're we
[27:44] are relying on you you are the true
[27:46] doctor that can come and touch every
[27:48] need and you know exactly how to go in
[27:50] there and wipe and destroy each and
[27:52] every one of those cancerous cells
[27:53] because we know it's nothing but from
[27:54] hell itself and satan has came up and
[27:57] tried to destroy the bride because he
[27:58] knows he knows his times is up lord and
[28:01] i'm believing that that cloud of fear
[28:03] that covers those that that may have
[28:04] just found out the diagnosis will just
[28:06] leave lord and we're just believing that
[28:08] you can just come down and touch and
[28:09] heal each and every one of our lives you
[28:11] know the unspoken request you know the
[28:13] spoken request and the sick that lies
[28:15] here within the building the sick that
[28:17] lies lies on the internet and the
[28:19] airways that that they are listening in
[28:21] just looking in for a nugget to continue
[28:23] to press forward in their battle because
[28:25] sometimes we're not on our mountaintops
[28:26] we're in the valleys lord and i just ask
[28:29] you will just draw us higher give us a
[28:31] word of word of encouragement when we
[28:33] are down lord and i believe in that you
[28:34] will just anoint the congregation anoint
[28:37] us so we can move into the presence of
[28:38] your speaker you know the inspiration
[28:40] that he's under this morning and you
[28:42] know what he's coming to bring and
[28:43] that's not of himself but he's kind he's
[28:46] coming to bring a word of you and i just
[28:47] ask you to just anoint him in a mighty
[28:49] way to speak directly to our hearts and
[28:51] we thank you for what you are doing in
[28:53] jesus name we pray
[28:57] [Music]

[1:04:48] there isn't anybody knows like i know
[1:04:52] what he did for me amen there's some
[1:04:54] people got an idea who was around there
[1:04:56] in those times and they saw that old
[1:04:59] arkansas boy come up to that altar that
[1:05:01] night and he never was the same after
[1:05:03] that
[1:05:04] they might have not knew what happened
[1:05:05] but they knew something happened amen
[1:05:08] because there was some change has come
[1:05:09] over me amen i thank god this morning
[1:05:12] that he is still a life-changing god
[1:05:15] he's one that can take whatever
[1:05:17] situation you're in and change it and
[1:05:19] put it back amen and give you the grace
[1:05:22] that you need to get through it amen
[1:05:24] amen i want to say it's a real honor to
[1:05:26] be here today in real grace you can have
[1:05:28] your seats just for a minute thank you
[1:05:30] amen i'm just i'm under commission here
[1:05:34] this morning to say some things to you
[1:05:36] all
[1:05:37] from the folks back home
[1:05:39] we had so many people that had planning
[1:05:41] to come and we had some deaths and the
[1:05:44] families of the church there so they
[1:05:45] they're not able to come this weekend
[1:05:47] one of them is our
[1:05:49] of course our brother chuck collins and
[1:05:51] sister debbie amen they they lost their
[1:05:54] their son charlie in an explosion there
[1:05:56] charlie and rachel i know you all know
[1:05:58] about it
[1:05:59] but it was you know i i think sometimes
[1:06:02] we look around at things and we think we
[1:06:04] can only see the bad in it but i was
[1:06:06] just speaking on a little scripture the
[1:06:07] other night and the prophet said you
[1:06:10] know when you come to be a christian he
[1:06:12] said there's no promise of an immunity
[1:06:14] from problems
[1:06:15] he said but see the scripture actually
[1:06:17] does promise that problems will come he
[1:06:19] said many shall be the afflictions of
[1:06:21] the righteous he said but never forget
[1:06:23] to look at the other part of that
[1:06:24] scripture it said he shall deliver us
[1:06:26] out of them all
[1:06:27] so you can't get on one side of that you
[1:06:29] have to also look at he'll deliver us of
[1:06:31] them all
[1:06:32] but i've seen god take the situation
[1:06:34] there with charlie and rachel and
[1:06:36] actually used it uh to during the just
[1:06:39] after the memorial service brother danny
[1:06:41] steeman stuck around and spoke for us on
[1:06:43] the sunday morning done a tremendous job
[1:06:45] god so uses brother danny we love him so
[1:06:47] much he's a he's a real man of god and
[1:06:50] uh so he was speaking that morning and
[1:06:52] one of the families um that had been uh
[1:06:55] brother tom actually uh
[1:06:57] the tom's sister sharon sproles has got
[1:07:00] an older son and a wife and some family
[1:07:03] and maybe a couple weeks before that
[1:07:05] they had just started coming back around
[1:07:06] the church a little bit been out of
[1:07:07] church for years and
[1:07:09] and they were actually coming around a
[1:07:11] little bit and that sunday morning but
[1:07:13] danny was speaking and and they come up
[1:07:16] as a family and the sister came up and
[1:07:18] she said brother wayne she said we we've
[1:07:20] been coming around a little bit she said
[1:07:22] but just through these things we just
[1:07:24] realized how important it is to give our
[1:07:26] lives to christ and and to to get a home
[1:07:29] church and to be in and she said i'm
[1:07:31] just wondering if the church would
[1:07:33] receive us back that we could come home
[1:07:35] and it's on video you know and i
[1:07:37] actually just welcomed her home and the
[1:07:39] church welcomed her home and and her
[1:07:42] little family there and i walked around
[1:07:43] the back and was able to shake hands
[1:07:45] with thomas he was in the back of the
[1:07:46] church there and he hugged my neck and
[1:07:48] told me how much it meant to him and he
[1:07:50] was looking so forward had actually just
[1:07:51] changed
[1:07:52] he'd actually just change jobs so he
[1:07:55] could be at church
[1:07:56] on thursdays and sundays he said i i he
[1:07:58] said it's more important than anything
[1:08:00] else he said we had to move out i think
[1:08:02] they actually moved in with brother tom
[1:08:04] and
[1:08:05] brother tom actually were coming to
[1:08:06] these meetings and brother ron was there
[1:08:08] a few weeks ago at our church he
[1:08:10] actually invited some of the people
[1:08:12] these a lot of them haven't been down
[1:08:13] and they really wanted to come and visit
[1:08:15] and i don't know if y'all know it's a
[1:08:17] secret but ron spencer's a rock star in
[1:08:19] ohio
[1:08:22] he's a
[1:08:23] he's a very loved man
[1:08:26] um
[1:08:27] i i'm afraid he might be that way a lot
[1:08:29] of places but uh but he's a he's a very
[1:08:32] uh loved man there and brother tom
[1:08:35] called me a few days after brother ron
[1:08:37] left he just you know tom called and he
[1:08:39] said by the way he said i want to come
[1:08:41] to them meetings he said but i have to
[1:08:43] be honest he said we just don't have the
[1:08:44] funds right now he said but i've made a
[1:08:47] decision he said i'm just going to sell
[1:08:49] my gun he said i'm going to get enough
[1:08:50] money to come down there and he did it
[1:08:52] he did he sold a real nice gun and he
[1:08:54] put back the money he said we got our
[1:08:56] rooms man they were ready to go and then
[1:08:59] and then just you know last sunday two
[1:09:02] weeks now uh they lost their son
[1:09:05] or it's just a week ago i guess they
[1:09:06] lost their son in an accident after the
[1:09:08] meetings
[1:09:09] they had a wedding in the evening and
[1:09:12] tom and his wife melissa they were
[1:09:14] actually the ones that were dedicated
[1:09:15] there and they were on their way home in
[1:09:18] a a car a drunk driver
[1:09:21] passed and got right in their lane and
[1:09:23] there was a head-on collision
[1:09:24] and everybody in the car was okay except
[1:09:27] for thomas and he was killed on the
[1:09:29] impact which was tom's son
[1:09:31] and so tom called me and and we were
[1:09:33] talking we actually were in is it okay
[1:09:35] we were we were in pigeon fours just the
[1:09:39] brother ron
[1:09:40] us was that down there we were just
[1:09:41] visiting and got the phone call and
[1:09:44] brother brother tom says to me uh i
[1:09:46] think he talked to me about three
[1:09:48] minutes there and telling me about it he
[1:09:49] said can you please tell brother ron i'm
[1:09:51] not gonna be able to make the meetings
[1:09:53] so it was the first thing on his heart
[1:09:55] you know is that he wouldn't be able to
[1:09:57] be here so i want you all to pray for
[1:09:59] brother tom and his family because he
[1:10:01] really wanted to be in these meetings
[1:10:03] this weekend and maybe maybe maybe next
[1:10:05] year he'll get to come down and
[1:10:07] fellowship and be a part and you all
[1:10:08] keep him in prayer and the family and
[1:10:11] i'm supposed to give you greetings from
[1:10:12] the whole church and brother uh brother
[1:10:15] ray of course and the family there
[1:10:16] brother erickson has said god bless you
[1:10:19] all and greetings and so we
[1:10:21] we certainly been going through a lot
[1:10:22] there but you know uh what we found out
[1:10:25] is that god
[1:10:26] amen ordains our paths
[1:10:29] and there's nothing can come our way
[1:10:31] unless he allows it and if god allows it
[1:10:33] he's already got a way to deliver us
[1:10:35] from it so we're walking with a great
[1:10:37] shepherd and trusting his every move and
[1:10:39] knowing amen that this is this is an
[1:10:42] ordained path and we can't never forget
[1:10:44] why we're here right we're here to get
[1:10:46] the character in our lives that it takes
[1:10:48] to rule in a millennium
[1:10:50] amen this is a proving ground for us now
[1:10:53] what we've found is though is along the
[1:10:55] way of course there's some heartaches of
[1:10:57] course there's some things that we don't
[1:10:58] know how to interpret or whatever but we
[1:11:01] know god's got it all in control
[1:11:03] but you know god gives us those little
[1:11:05] blessings along the way he he just gives
[1:11:07] us nuggets and and and blessings and
[1:11:10] miracles in our lives and i'm blessed
[1:11:12] today to have uh
[1:11:13] my family with me gracie and brian
[1:11:15] wasn't able to be here and they send
[1:11:17] their greetings to you all
[1:11:18] but i've i've been a blessed man i've
[1:11:20] got three children they're all serving
[1:11:22] the lord filled with the holy ghost
[1:11:25] love this message serving god right with
[1:11:27] us
[1:11:27] and and and brother if you don't think
[1:11:29] that's a blessing that's the greatest
[1:11:31] blessing that i know of and and god's
[1:11:33] given us good in-laws and y'all know
[1:11:35] that's a miracle right amen and we've
[1:11:37] got we've got wonderful in-laws and we
[1:11:40] love them and and uh and the holy
[1:11:42] spirit's been so good to us it was just
[1:11:44] uh just a couple years ago that anna and
[1:11:47] zach was having such a terrible time uh
[1:11:50] trying to have a baby they were having
[1:11:51] miscarriages and there was all kinds of
[1:11:54] questions about whether they were going
[1:11:55] to be able to or not and and i they were
[1:11:58] living there in the basement zach works
[1:12:00] as a nurse and he was gone at nights and
[1:12:02] so anna was staying there and and you
[1:12:04] know they just started staying around
[1:12:06] living there in the basement
[1:12:07] and so
[1:12:08] i was there when they were praying and
[1:12:10] when they were getting disappointments
[1:12:12] and you know how that is it's just like
[1:12:14] a roller coaster and then and then the
[1:12:16] holy spirit just began to deal and one
[1:12:18] day they came brother ron actually was
[1:12:20] up at the church and they come in a
[1:12:22] prayer line and i was sitting there
[1:12:23] thinking i was standing beside brother
[1:12:25] ron was praying for some people and i
[1:12:27] was sitting there thinking lord if ann
[1:12:29] and zach could just come in this prayer
[1:12:30] line today
[1:12:31] i believe it would be you speaking you
[1:12:33] know and the next thing i know i looked
[1:12:35] up and here comes ann and zach and they
[1:12:37] come right down here
[1:12:38] and you know
[1:12:39] you tell these things but i i don't
[1:12:42] think we are to ever forget
[1:12:45] what the lord has done for us
[1:12:48] i don't think we already ever let the
[1:12:49] devil take away the reality
[1:12:52] that god has done miracles in our lives
[1:12:56] we never forget the tragedies we never
[1:12:58] forget the troubles but i don't believe
[1:13:00] we ought to ever let these blessings
[1:13:01] pass from our memory and you know i i
[1:13:05] was standing right there when brother
[1:13:06] ron looked over at sister anna and zach
[1:13:09] and when he looked at anna and he said
[1:13:11] you're going to have that child and i
[1:13:13] don't remember exact words but it was
[1:13:14] that direct you're going to have that
[1:13:16] baby anna and it wasn't but it wasn't
[1:13:18] but a while later of course then uh of
[1:13:21] course there's no baby coming and you
[1:13:23] know how the devil when god ain't
[1:13:25] speaking the devil gets the whispering
[1:13:26] you know and uh we were actually out at
[1:13:28] brother wendell martens working on a
[1:13:32] a parking lot and i was listening to a
[1:13:33] tape the spear lord just sit right there
[1:13:35] in the greater with me and he spoke to
[1:13:37] my heart you're going to have that
[1:13:38] grandchild and i thought thank you lord
[1:13:40] for the for the encouragement you know
[1:13:43] and then it just rocked along a little
[1:13:44] while and i came out here and preached
[1:13:46] for you all you all remember and i'm up
[1:13:47] here telling you i'm going to be a
[1:13:48] grandpa and everybody's like you got
[1:13:50] news and i'm like no it's by faith
[1:13:52] it's my faith and then brother robin's
[1:13:54] sitting right back there and he hollers
[1:13:56] they get it on the video and he hollers
[1:13:58] from the back and he said that's thus
[1:13:59] saith the lord brother wayne well later
[1:14:01] you know we found out he had a vision
[1:14:04] over the thing so he wasn't even
[1:14:05] guessing he knew exactly what was going
[1:14:07] to be happening amen he had that
[1:14:09] blessing and and so then of course then
[1:14:12] when the lord began to give and we
[1:14:14] started getting proof with with the test
[1:14:16] and then we started getting the
[1:14:18] ultrasounds and and all that was
[1:14:20] powerful but you know today i literally
[1:14:22] live with the reality of a fulfilled
[1:14:25] vision that's happened in my life and
[1:14:28] and i'll tell you right here today anna
[1:14:29] and zach sits here and there's little
[1:14:31] evelyn amen and god miraculously gave us
[1:14:35] this baby and we're thankful for it and
[1:14:37] we're going to tell the world god did it
[1:14:39] for us it was not an accident some
[1:14:42] little something didn't just change
[1:14:44] our god intervened and he changed the
[1:14:47] pattern of whatever was wrong and made
[1:14:49] it right again because he's that kind of
[1:14:51] god
[1:14:52] the god of elijah is still alive today
[1:14:56] he is still alive he's still moving in
[1:14:59] the church
[1:15:01] so i had this on my heart last year up
[1:15:03] at brother ed biscuit and brother tom
[1:15:05] ray there at their mount baker camp in
[1:15:08] the fall in august there and i had this
[1:15:10] on my heart and right at the end of it i
[1:15:11] was preaching on visions and talking
[1:15:13] about the experiencing of of being in
[1:15:15] the middle of something and not
[1:15:17] realizing it's a vision and you're in
[1:15:19] the middle of it and then one day you
[1:15:20] wake up and whoa this is exactly what
[1:15:22] the vision was and i started telling
[1:15:24] about this about this great miracle of
[1:15:27] evelyn and when i did i didn't know this
[1:15:29] but brother brian was sitting over there
[1:15:31] on the piano plane and they had just
[1:15:34] come through some tragic miscarriages
[1:15:36] and he said they were at the point of
[1:15:38] just completely giving up but there i
[1:15:40] stood with a testimony that almighty god
[1:15:43] can still change things when you're run
[1:15:45] out of hope when you've run out of
[1:15:46] chances when you've run out of testimony
[1:15:49] when you think it's all finished there's
[1:15:51] god on the scene to change the situation
[1:15:54] and when brother ron was there in
[1:15:55] jubilee meetings there amen he got up
[1:15:58] and made a testimony and put the picture
[1:16:00] of his little baby up there listen
[1:16:02] friends god's still alive
[1:16:04] and the reason we tell these miracles is
[1:16:06] because they keep moving and they keep
[1:16:08] going into other lives and somebody will
[1:16:10] walk up to me and they say brother wayne
[1:16:11] i heard that testimony and i believed it
[1:16:13] and here's the baby or here's the
[1:16:16] situation or this was healed or this was
[1:16:18] given because god is still alive we want
[1:16:20] to thank god this morning we want to
[1:16:22] thank you for every miracle that's been
[1:16:24] done in this church we want to thank you
[1:16:25] for every miracle that's been done
[1:16:27] across the land amen i believe in
[1:16:30] worshiping the god of miracles amen i
[1:16:32] believe we are to publish it we are to
[1:16:34] tell it we ought to tell it high and far
[1:16:36] and wide but our god reigns our god
[1:16:39] lives he's in the miracle business he's
[1:16:41] in the saving business don't give up
[1:16:43] hope if you've got loved ones and
[1:16:45] they're still breathing don't give up
[1:16:47] hope if you know somebody and it looks
[1:16:49] like they're outside of the grace of god
[1:16:51] don't give up on them the god that i
[1:16:53] serve is a god of first chances second
[1:16:56] chances third chances he don't quit till

[1:20:07] unto us all things
[1:20:09] that pertain unto life and godliness
[1:20:11] through the knowledge of him
[1:20:13] that have called us to glory and virtue
[1:20:16] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[1:20:19] great
[1:20:20] and precious promises
[1:20:22] that by these ye may be partakers
[1:20:26] of the divine nature
[1:20:28] having escaped isn't it amazing having
[1:20:31] escaped
[1:20:35] have you escaped
[1:20:38] having escaped
[1:20:40] the corruption
[1:20:41] that is in the world through lust
[1:20:44] we ask the lord to bless his words you
[1:20:46] could be seated this morning
[1:20:48] i want to speak to you from this context
[1:20:51] an expression
[1:20:53] of a divine nature
[1:20:55] an expression
[1:20:57] of a divine nature you know the beauty
[1:20:59] and the most rewarding thing
[1:21:01] of being a christian
[1:21:03] is to receive the nature of christ
[1:21:06] to have the nature of christ is a
[1:21:08] powerful it's a powerful thing it's the
[1:21:10] only character in the bible
[1:21:13] that could save souls that could change
[1:21:15] things and put them the back the way
[1:21:17] they were brother brandon said you can
[1:21:18] go through the whole bible and it's the
[1:21:20] only character that could save you moses
[1:21:22] couldn't do it elijah couldn't do it
[1:21:24] enoch couldn't do it no other character
[1:21:26] in the bible but the character of jesus
[1:21:29] christ which is the nature of god it can
[1:21:31] save us take us out of all of our
[1:21:33] situations now in the adoption part two
[1:21:36] brother adam will say this inside of
[1:21:38] that it was attributes which meant that
[1:21:40] he was inside of great elohim was an
[1:21:44] attribute now you know what an attribute
[1:21:46] is or let me say it like this it was a
[1:21:48] nature
[1:21:49] so inside of elohim was an attribute and
[1:21:52] brother bram says an attribute is a
[1:21:54] nature
[1:21:55] so an attribute see inside of him was
[1:21:57] the nature to be a father but he was
[1:21:59] self-existent so there's nothing to
[1:22:01] father by now down inside of that he
[1:22:04] said with something else that he was god
[1:22:06] and god is an object of worship but he
[1:22:08] was self-existent he was elohim so there
[1:22:11] was nothing to worship inside of that he
[1:22:13] was a savior and there was nothing lost
[1:22:15] to be saved inside of that he was a
[1:22:17] healer but there was nothing sick to be
[1:22:19] healed
[1:22:20] or nothing to be sick so now do you get
[1:22:23] the picture so his attributes his nature
[1:22:26] produced what is today
[1:22:29] so because that he was a healer
[1:22:32] something had to be sick to prove his
[1:22:35] healing never the will of god that you
[1:22:37] would be sick it's the will of god for
[1:22:39] you to know he's a healer
[1:22:40] amen
[1:22:41] without someone lost you would never
[1:22:43] know he's a savior so god never intended
[1:22:46] for man to be lost he intended for you
[1:22:48] to have the revelation that you're saved
[1:22:51] now that's the revelation of salvation
[1:22:54] in the future home brother branham will
[1:22:55] say this adam was a direct descent from
[1:22:57] god and you can only take the nature of
[1:22:59] your parent and when you were born again
[1:23:02] you take the nature of your parent of
[1:23:04] heaven and your parent of heaven is the
[1:23:06] attribute of the word
[1:23:08] see the word is the attribute of your
[1:23:11] parent how can you deny it see for a
[1:23:14] denomination amen now watch what he's
[1:23:16] saying the word is the attribute of your
[1:23:19] parents so whatever's in the scripture
[1:23:21] is the attribute of the nature of being
[1:23:24] a christian so like if you read
[1:23:25] something in the bible that's that's
[1:23:28] speaking of your nature it's a
[1:23:29] description of the character of jesus
[1:23:32] christ every scripture explains jesus
[1:23:35] christ so you're seeing his nature or
[1:23:38] his character being revealed now the
[1:23:40] grace of god is is that you as a
[1:23:43] believer have the same nature or
[1:23:45] character living on the inside of you so
[1:23:48] the word is the explanation of your
[1:23:51] attribute or your character i'll just
[1:23:53] say it like this the word attribute can
[1:23:56] be defined as such an attribute of god
[1:23:59] can be defined as an ascensional
[1:24:01] or a permanent characteristic of a
[1:24:03] nature see they're also called god's
[1:24:06] perfections individual attributes may be
[1:24:08] studied by themselves or considering how
[1:24:10] they relate to overall character of god
[1:24:12] so brother ram in identifying god by
[1:24:15] characteristics remember he said god's
[1:24:16] always supernatural
[1:24:19] that's how you identify until you you
[1:24:21] hunters you know i i remember as a kid
[1:24:23] we used to go quail hunting i shot a
[1:24:25] bunch of sparrows you know because i
[1:24:26] didn't know how to tell the difference
[1:24:28] and they just they were just birds you
[1:24:30] know hey man i thought i had me uh had
[1:24:32] me a pile but they were easier to kill
[1:24:34] than quail you know amen but but it's
[1:24:36] just a bird unless you know the
[1:24:38] difference you know but the difference
[1:24:40] is the character it's the it's the way
[1:24:42] that they fly it's a certain
[1:24:44] characteristic about them that you can
[1:24:46] tell the difference and he's telling us
[1:24:49] that the attribute of a christian is the
[1:24:52] characteristic of god there's a
[1:24:54] character there there's a spirit there
[1:24:56] of a christian now of course now in the
[1:24:58] easter seal brother branama really opens
[1:25:00] something up in john chapter 5 and 24 he
[1:25:03] that heareth my words and believeth upon
[1:25:05] him have passed from death unto life and
[1:25:07] shall not come into condemnation what is
[1:25:10] it he has eternal life he doesn't come
[1:25:12] into judgment he's already passed from
[1:25:15] death and to life then when this new
[1:25:17] eternal life dwells in you
[1:25:20] it is the potential or the earnest of
[1:25:23] you being quickened from mortal to
[1:25:25] immortality now let me say this again
[1:25:28] when the spirit has found you this
[1:25:30] individual it comes upon you it is the
[1:25:33] potential of your internal inheritance
[1:25:36] that god thought of you and made you
[1:25:38] before the foundation of the world there
[1:25:41] is your potential like if you asked me
[1:25:44] for an oak tree and i gave you an acorn
[1:25:46] the life for the oak tree is in the
[1:25:48] acorn but you have to wait till it grows
[1:25:51] up so brother brahma is telling us when
[1:25:53] you receive the holy ghost everything
[1:25:56] that's going to be an oak tree is in you
[1:25:58] right then
[1:25:59] every
[1:26:00] now you look at that great big oak out
[1:26:02] there and he has that great big expanse
[1:26:04] and spread and you think my goodness
[1:26:07] amen how did that ever got there it got
[1:26:09] there because the life of an oak tree
[1:26:12] was put in the ground and the ability to
[1:26:15] get that talk was in the seed the
[1:26:17] ability to produce those leaves were in
[1:26:19] the sea now i know some people don't
[1:26:21] know the difference in the oak tree and
[1:26:22] a poplar you know what i mean amen takes
[1:26:24] a longer sometimes to know everybody
[1:26:26] knows the difference between pine tree
[1:26:27] and oak tree but an old tree in a pine
[1:26:30] tree are two different characteristics
[1:26:32] of the same life they're ones expressing
[1:26:34] one thing one's expressing another but
[1:26:36] you see the potential to do so i i've
[1:26:39] always said this god's a great big god
[1:26:41] can you imagine he's so but so big that
[1:26:43] he can become so small you you wait and
[1:26:46] you you put a seat in the ground it's an
[1:26:48] apple seed and you can put an entire uh
[1:26:51] tree in the ground in a seed can you
[1:26:53] imagine that amen you can you can dig a
[1:26:56] little bitty hole and get a great big
[1:26:58] apple tree out of that little bitty seed
[1:27:00] that you put in that hole you can let
[1:27:02] that apple tree grow up in every bushel
[1:27:04] of apple that ever is hauled away from
[1:27:07] that tree amen come out of that one seed
[1:27:10] god can put a hundred bushels of apple
[1:27:12] in one seed
[1:27:14] you try to cut that tree down after it
[1:27:16] comes to maturity and it'll take you a
[1:27:18] couple trailer loads of brush and wood
[1:27:21] to haul off a tree that god could give
[1:27:23] you and one seed see because he's god he
[1:27:26] can put the potential in a seed and so
[1:27:30] is it with a christian that god put the
[1:27:32] potential of everything that ever will
[1:27:35] happen as a christian in that seed life
[1:27:37] he put the body change in that seed he
[1:27:40] put attributes in that seed he put life
[1:27:42] in that seed it is the potential it is
[1:27:45] the earnest brother ma'am said the
[1:27:46] earnest of the potential is the
[1:27:48] quickening power of the resurrection
[1:27:50] when you receive the holy ghost it's
[1:27:52] dwelling in you the potential of it now
[1:27:54] you're on your way growing to full
[1:27:56] resurrection no tree comes up overnight
[1:27:58] it's got to grow as we grow in the grace
[1:28:01] and knowledge of god you are baptized in
[1:28:03] the holy spirit and as a pentecostal
[1:28:05] church baptized into the holy spirit it
[1:28:07] begins to grow limbs are added they're
[1:28:10] pruning off but the tree is still
[1:28:12] growing it's still going because it's
[1:28:14] got to come to full resurrection
[1:28:17] it's got to come to full resurrection if
[1:28:20] you let that which is in you now grow it
[1:28:24] will grow into full resurrection it will
[1:28:28] give every attribute of it now a
[1:28:30] potential you know what a potential is
[1:28:32] and brother branham says it in that
[1:28:33] great message spoken word original seed
[1:28:36] pick up your pen and write how many
[1:28:37] remembers that he said as this church
[1:28:39] begins to near the headstone which we
[1:28:41] are
[1:28:42] he said when she begins to near the
[1:28:44] headstone he says what has happened he
[1:28:46] said they will love him and they will
[1:28:48] have his potentials for he is their head
[1:28:52] and he is and they are his subjects and
[1:28:54] the headship of christ so so the church
[1:28:57] will have the potentials of god at the
[1:29:00] time of the headstones because the
[1:29:02] church has grown into maturity means
[1:29:06] that the maturity of what christ was has
[1:29:09] returned back to the church that's why
[1:29:12] we're not just in justification or
[1:29:13] sanctification we're not even in the in
[1:29:16] the in the realm of the baptism of the
[1:29:18] holy ghost to reform the gifts we have
[1:29:20] taken the baptism of the holy ghost and
[1:29:22] brought on the extreme nature of jesus
[1:29:25] christ into the church of the living god
[1:29:27] that's why we believe that there's
[1:29:29] nothing that cannot happen in the church
[1:29:31] of the living god because we are not a
[1:29:34] baby church we are a mature church in
[1:29:37] the grace of almighty god now in the
[1:29:39] maturing process we must remember this
[1:29:42] we have already raised how many knows
[1:29:44] that the scripture says it we have
[1:29:46] already raised we have raised from the
[1:29:48] things of the world and we have went
[1:29:50] into the promises of god and we have his
[1:29:53] potential in other words we're raised up
[1:29:55] out of the things we used to be used to
[1:29:57] do the way we used to be we have raised
[1:30:00] out of it by a resurrection power and
[1:30:03] where we are this morning as a church as
[1:30:05] a people in the message of the hour as
[1:30:08] we're praying that famous prayer thy
[1:30:10] will be done on earth as it is in heaven
[1:30:14] we have come to the same place jesus was
[1:30:18] in the fact of maturity
[1:30:20] is brought us to full obedience to the
[1:30:23] word of god that's where we're standing
[1:30:25] we're not looking for ways around it
[1:30:27] we're not looking for ways to live
[1:30:29] separate from it but we have realized i
[1:30:32] and my father
[1:30:34] are one
[1:30:36] it's where the church has come i am my
[1:30:38] father one so the potential of the
[1:30:40] father is now being seen
[1:30:43] in the church
[1:30:45] now watch this beautiful prayer of jesus
[1:30:48] matthew 6 chapter 9 through 15. this is
[1:30:51] where the disciples themselves didn't
[1:30:53] know how to pray
[1:30:54] and they asked the lord said would you
[1:30:56] teach us to pray
[1:30:57] would you teach us lord how to pray now
[1:31:00] when jesus teaches you to pray it's
[1:31:02] something you should pay attention to
[1:31:04] he said after this manner therefore pray
[1:31:07] our father which art in heaven
[1:31:10] hallowed be thy name
[1:31:12] thy kingdom come
[1:31:14] thy will be done
[1:31:17] in earth
[1:31:20] in earth
[1:31:22] as it is in heaven
[1:31:24] give us this daily bread
[1:31:27] and forgive our debts as we forgive our
[1:31:30] debtors
[1:31:32] now lead us not in temptation but
[1:31:33] deliver us from evil for thine is the
[1:31:35] kingdom and the power and the glory
[1:31:37] forever
[1:31:38] amen
[1:31:39] and the very next words the lord says is
[1:31:42] for if you forgive me their trespasses
[1:31:44] your heavenly father will also forgive
[1:31:47] you
[1:31:48] now why has jesus put forgiveness at
[1:31:52] that level
[1:31:53] have you ever noticed this in perfect
[1:31:55] faith brother braham said forgiveness he
[1:31:57] says faith is based on forgiveness
[1:32:01] so when you come to the level of perfect
[1:32:03] faith there has to be a perfect
[1:32:05] forgiveness in jesus in matthew in mark
[1:32:08] chapter 11 in the middle of introducing
[1:32:12] the spoken word to the church he
[1:32:14] immediately stops and says if you have
[1:32:16] ought against any and look what he does
[1:32:18] he brings forgiveness in to the pattern
[1:32:21] because unless there is a complete open
[1:32:25] slate then then the very faith that we
[1:32:28] desire in this age is not obtainable
[1:32:31] if it's not complete forgiveness now
[1:32:34] watch the beauty of this he says now to
[1:32:36] forgive now many times you talk about
[1:32:38] forgiveness in a church now we're
[1:32:40] talking about a divine attribute you
[1:32:42] talk about forgiveness in a church and
[1:32:44] now any church or anybody and i'm i'm
[1:32:46] aware people are watching so it's just
[1:32:47] going different places but in any church
[1:32:50] or in any a conversation with any family
[1:32:53] with any situation you all have been
[1:32:56] through things and most of you have been
[1:32:58] through a lot of things
[1:33:00] some of you have have maybe have just
[1:33:03] been salvaged from some great tragedies
[1:33:06] in your life and many times i hate to
[1:33:09] say it but maybe it's even clashes with
[1:33:11] religious people and situations and
[1:33:14] sometimes leaves people wounded and hurt
[1:33:16] and great things happen to people in
[1:33:18] their lives and i believe honestly if if
[1:33:21] i were just taking a poll of the message
[1:33:24] of the hour across the nations and
[1:33:26] looking into churches i would say
[1:33:28] probably one of the most the one of the
[1:33:31] most
[1:33:32] hurtful spirits that there is that moves
[1:33:35] among the churches or the people is the
[1:33:37] spirit of unforgiveness
[1:33:39] i think it's the most damaging thing
[1:33:41] that i could think of standing in the
[1:33:43] platform today i don't believe smoking
[1:33:45] is just the big problems that we're
[1:33:47] having maybe maybe it's not alcoholism
[1:33:51] but it is a spirit that is just as
[1:33:54] detrimental to a family as it is an
[1:33:56] alcoholic or a dope addict or anything
[1:33:59] else because it will end up in the same
[1:34:00] result even if it's not viewed in the
[1:34:04] same level amen but in the spiritual
[1:34:06] world you can look into the realms and
[1:34:08] realize that forgiveness is there now
[1:34:10] many times if there's something that is
[1:34:12] wrong it's because something has been
[1:34:15] done so like if someone's asking for
[1:34:17] forgiveness or needing forgiveness is
[1:34:19] because there has been something that
[1:34:21] has happened now i i know that i know
[1:34:24] this from personal uh experience now i'm
[1:34:26] going to preach from my heart this
[1:34:27] morning hey ben but there is sometimes
[1:34:29] uh things that happen let's just let's
[1:34:31] just give a definition of forgiveness
[1:34:33] forgiveness is a conscience or
[1:34:35] deliberate decision to release feelings
[1:34:38] of resentment or vengeance toward a
[1:34:40] person or a group that has harmed you
[1:34:43] regardless of whether they actually
[1:34:45] deserve forgiveness forgiveness does not
[1:34:48] mean forgetting nor does
[1:34:51] it mean condoning an offense
[1:34:55] now many people can't forgive because
[1:34:57] they think forgiveness is condoning
[1:34:59] let's just say that there's someone
[1:35:00] mistreats a child i think probably the
[1:35:02] worst thing that i could think of as a
[1:35:04] preacher is someone who abuses a child i
[1:35:06] think it's the worst offense could be
[1:35:07] done to any person in the world is the
[1:35:09] abuse of a child but if a child
[1:35:11] someone's abused a child they come to
[1:35:13] you and they ask for forgiveness for
[1:35:15] what they've done they want to correct
[1:35:16] their life as a christian we are duty
[1:35:19] bound to offer forgiveness to all men so
[1:35:22] we forgive but that does not condone
[1:35:24] what has been done it's only forgiveness
[1:35:28] so as amen that whatever they face as a
[1:35:31] punishment that's up to them but what i
[1:35:33] will not allow is i will not allow
[1:35:36] someone else's transgression to tie up
[1:35:39] my spiritual life where i can't sing or
[1:35:42] shout or preach or have a free spirit
[1:35:45] and love people listen i i want to put
[1:35:47] it out there very clearly amen that
[1:35:49] forgiveness is not for the person you
[1:35:52] forgive forgiveness is for the
[1:35:54] individual giving the forgiveness
[1:35:56] do you realize that when you forgive
[1:35:58] someone you have just released yourself
[1:36:01] from whatever they have done said how
[1:36:04] they've acted or whatever else has took
[1:36:06] place you are free whether they ever
[1:36:08] become free or not you are free because
[1:36:11] forgiveness is the thing god gives you
[1:36:14] to let you walk away from situations
[1:36:17] that are unfixable situations that could
[1:36:20] never help you but you could walk away
[1:36:22] from them amen now let me just say this
[1:36:25] i will never allow someone else to
[1:36:27] control my spiritual life i will not let
[1:36:30] somebody say enough bad things about me
[1:36:33] for me to walk away from jesus christ i
[1:36:36] will not let enough preachers criticize
[1:36:38] me to make me walk away from the
[1:36:40] platform so the only thing i can do to
[1:36:42] keep from being a bitter critical person
[1:36:45] is to say i forgive you whether they've
[1:36:47] asked for it whether they deserve it
[1:36:49] whatever happens the thing is i will not
[1:36:52] allow it to destroy me because it's
[1:36:55] destroying them i cannot i cannot
[1:36:57] control what people say about me i
[1:37:00] cannot control what people think about
[1:37:02] me but i can control how i feel about
[1:37:06] other people and i say i have no enemy i
[1:37:09] say i love every man i forgive every man
[1:37:13] i forgive every trespass because i am a
[1:37:16] son of the living god and an attribute
[1:37:19] of god is to forgive mankind
[1:37:23] that's what the attribute of god is i'm
[1:37:25] talking about real christianity i'm
[1:37:27] talking about mature christians you've
[1:37:29] got to learn how to shake off what the
[1:37:32] devil is trying to stick on to you
[1:37:35] you've got to learn how to shake it off
[1:37:38] and walk on and say god i don't know
[1:37:40] what's happening or what's taking place
[1:37:42] but father i will not stay
[1:37:45] in this place the enemy has tried to
[1:37:47] bring me
[1:37:50] now
[1:37:51] unforgiveness
[1:37:52] can we talk about it a minute this
[1:37:54] morning
[1:37:56] now what i'm talking about is the
[1:37:57] attribute of divine nature don't lose
[1:38:00] our subject
[1:38:03] unforgiveness
[1:38:05] breeds things
[1:38:08] so when someone says i can't forgive
[1:38:11] what you have done
[1:38:13] is you're creating an atmosphere
[1:38:16] and you're inviting other things
[1:38:19] now
[1:38:21] now i've got to say things simple
[1:38:22] because i'm a simple man
[1:38:24] but i'm a hillbilly i come from arkansas
[1:38:27] originally before
[1:38:28] lord transplanted me into ohio and
[1:38:30] we love we love the people in ohio they
[1:38:32] tell me somebody said here a while back
[1:38:34] how's it feel being a yankee i said i'm
[1:38:35] not a yankee now i'm just transplanted i
[1:38:37] got a stronghold in the north
[1:38:41] we laugh about it of course now
[1:38:45] but down in arkansas when i was a kid
[1:38:47] growing up we didn't have an air
[1:38:48] conditioner i know probably all you all
[1:38:50] know how that feels
[1:38:51] but now down in arkansas gets hot
[1:38:54] if we have one
[1:38:55] a little older we have one in the in the
[1:38:57] front room but at night of course all we
[1:38:59] had is that oh attic fan how many y'all
[1:39:01] grew up with the attic fan
[1:39:03] edo addict fan
[1:39:04] now it was a
[1:39:05] the real problem is three bedrooms so we
[1:39:07] had to measure
[1:39:09] you had to measure the windows to make
[1:39:10] sure nobody had their window up more
[1:39:12] than yours
[1:39:15] because
[1:39:16] you know i always thought my granddad
[1:39:18] had a house in the back of his head
[1:39:19] because he'd be back in his bedroom i'd
[1:39:20] stay night with him me and the cousin
[1:39:22] sneak out you know
[1:39:23] he always knew
[1:39:25] he'd haul her from his bedroom where you
[1:39:27] boys going
[1:39:28] how did he know
[1:39:30] it's because the attic fan was running
[1:39:32] and when you open the door it cut the
[1:39:34] air off in his bedroom
[1:39:37] took me years to figure that out
[1:39:43] so you always wanted everybody to have
[1:39:44] their you know the windows the same
[1:39:47] but
[1:39:49] but it was hot
[1:39:51] and you had to cover up with the sheets
[1:39:53] the most you could stand
[1:39:54] and a lot of times you couldn't stand
[1:39:56] the sheet because in the old summer
[1:39:57] nights they were not just hot but muggy
[1:39:59] i mean how many y'all have been in
[1:40:01] arkansas on the july night or august
[1:40:04] it's muggy i mean it can be 80 90
[1:40:06] percent humidity it's like being in the
[1:40:08] amazon man i mean just muggy
[1:40:10] so you you don't have air conditioner so
[1:40:12] you can't cover up
[1:40:14] now what has happened is all night
[1:40:15] because your kids you're running in and
[1:40:17] out the door
[1:40:18] i always thought the only thing my dad
[1:40:19] could say was shut that door
[1:40:22] i thought for sure that's all he knew
[1:40:24] shut the door
[1:40:26] but
[1:40:28] but as kids we didn't really understand
[1:40:30] the repercussions of the open door until
[1:40:33] you laid down at night
[1:40:35] when you're running back and forth
[1:40:37] though you don't think a thing about it
[1:40:38] but dad knows night's coming
[1:40:40] and when night time come you go in there
[1:40:42] and try to lay down
[1:40:43] listen if you don't think that one
[1:40:46] person can make a difference spend the
[1:40:48] night with a mosquito
[1:40:53] he is a tormentor
[1:40:55] i promise you he is a fallen nature
[1:41:00] keep you up all night and you ain't got
[1:41:01] an air conditioner so you can't cover up
[1:41:03] now
[1:41:04] what i'm saying is whatever reason we
[1:41:07] was going in and out that door
[1:41:09] the mosquitoes didn't care the reason
[1:41:11] they just come through the door
[1:41:15] the devil don't care why
[1:41:17] that you open a door he just wants the
[1:41:20] door open
[1:41:22] but the problem is whatever reason you
[1:41:24] open the door other things come in
[1:41:27] through that door
[1:41:29] so sometimes you see things start in
[1:41:32] human they come right into christian
[1:41:34] lives and you think how did that get in
[1:41:37] those lives how'd that get there through
[1:41:40] a door called unforgiveness because
[1:41:43] someone hurt someone's feelings somebody
[1:41:45] said something to somebody some
[1:41:47] situation happened now yeah y'all know
[1:41:49] i'm telling you the truth amen and when
[1:41:51] that door is opened amen all of a sudden
[1:41:54] these other things come in so you never
[1:41:56] open the door for those things but those
[1:41:58] things got in anyhow so what you have to
[1:42:01] do is god gave us a way to keep that
[1:42:04] door off now ephesians chapter 4
[1:42:06] uh paul tells us this
[1:42:08] he tells us in the fourth chapter the
[1:42:10] 30th verse grieve not the holy spirit of
[1:42:12] god whereby you are sealed until the day
[1:42:15] of redemption let all bitterness and
[1:42:16] wrath and anger and clamor and evil
[1:42:18] speak and be put away from you with all
[1:42:21] malice be you kind to one another tender
[1:42:23] hearted forgiving one another even as
[1:42:26] god for christ's sake hath forgiven you
[1:42:30] now look what he says grieve not the
[1:42:32] holy spirit do you know there are people
[1:42:34] now this this this verse here can have
[1:42:36] kind of a double meaning amen and and
[1:42:39] the exact meaning of it means that that
[1:42:42] that a man filled with the holy ghost
[1:42:44] can still grieve god
[1:42:46] now brother branham explains this in a
[1:42:48] message lamb and dove and he talks about
[1:42:50] grieving the dove away
[1:42:52] he talks about see as a christian your
[1:42:55] soul is sealed and it's always going to
[1:42:57] be sealed you're not going to gain or
[1:43:00] lose christianity what happens is your
[1:43:03] spirit is affected by the things you do
[1:43:05] so brother branham says if you grieve
[1:43:07] that spirit by some action or something
[1:43:10] he said the dove will go out and fly on
[1:43:13] a limb y'all remember that he said that
[1:43:15] devil go out and fly on a limb what
[1:43:17] you've done is you grieve that spirit
[1:43:19] away from you and then that's when you
[1:43:21] get sticky and nasty and mean and you do
[1:43:24] all kinds of things you never would have
[1:43:25] did it's because you grieved that spirit
[1:43:28] away from your life and brother brahm
[1:43:30] said now there's a way to get it back he
[1:43:32] said you just repent and that spirit
[1:43:34] will fly right back on your life and
[1:43:37] bring back that gentle sweet spirit
[1:43:39] right on the inside of you now listen we
[1:43:41] are not we are not wolves we are sheep
[1:43:45] so we're not going to be protecting
[1:43:46] ourselves we've got to be lambs if you
[1:43:49] ever take the nature that you have to
[1:43:51] protect yourself that you turn into a
[1:43:53] wolf and you start defending yourself
[1:43:56] from everybody and everything and it'll
[1:43:58] give you a nature that's not christian
[1:44:00] nature at all but if you're a lamb
[1:44:02] remember this we've got a shepherd and
[1:44:04] we do not have to protect ourselves our
[1:44:07] shepherd is our protector and he always
[1:44:10] will protect us so all we have to do is
[1:44:13] just let go and let god and not worry
[1:44:16] with it god will take care of it now
[1:44:17] people say to me all the time so by the
[1:44:19] way you talk about forgiveness a lot i
[1:44:21] do because the bible said as you forgive
[1:44:24] one another as christ has forgiven you
[1:44:27] so how how do you forgive someone you
[1:44:30] forgive them on the same level god
[1:44:32] forgives you
[1:44:34] now some of you sitting here today are
[1:44:36] forgiven people
[1:44:38] some of you like me have been forgiven a
[1:44:41] lot of things
[1:44:43] and any man that has been forgiven as
[1:44:45] much as i have been forgiven by my
[1:44:48] father i have a lot of forgiveness to
[1:44:50] give amen i literally before you even
[1:44:53] get it out of your mouth i've already
[1:44:54] forgave you before you even said it i've
[1:44:57] already forgave you because what i know
[1:44:59] is that i have been given so much it is
[1:45:02] very easy for me to give because i can
[1:45:05] forgive it is the nature on the inside
[1:45:07] now some people have men never even
[1:45:10] receive the holy ghost because of
[1:45:12] unforgiveness now one time a young man
[1:45:15] came in and counseled something with me
[1:45:16] he's trying to receive the holy ghost
[1:45:18] and he was telling me almost that it was
[1:45:20] god's fault he hadn't received the holy
[1:45:22] ghost and i got to talking to him a
[1:45:24] little bit and as we were in council we
[1:45:26] just sat and talked a while and we moved
[1:45:29] across different areas of his life and
[1:45:31] and a lot of times you know young people
[1:45:33] are suffering maybe with pornography or
[1:45:35] something going on on the internet and
[1:45:37] there and it's and it's a hang up for
[1:45:39] them and they can't get by it and get
[1:45:40] the holy ghost maybe sometimes there's a
[1:45:43] little something going on maybe in their
[1:45:44] life what they've done or hadn't done
[1:45:46] and you know there's there's multiple
[1:45:48] things there seems like it blocks people
[1:45:50] from getting the holy ghost so i was
[1:45:51] just walking with him through his life a
[1:45:53] little just searching and all of a
[1:45:55] sudden something come up about his
[1:45:56] childhood and his father and he and he
[1:45:58] said something about his dad and the
[1:46:00] moment he spoke his dad's name i felt
[1:46:03] the presence of god dropping the room i
[1:46:05] said now we've found the problem what's
[1:46:07] going on and he's began to talk to me a
[1:46:09] little bit and he told me how he'd been
[1:46:11] mistreated as a young man and the
[1:46:13] bitterness that was in his heart and i
[1:46:14] said brother i said i'll tell you this
[1:46:17] amen it's not a woman keeping you from
[1:46:19] getting the holy ghost it's not any
[1:46:22] habit of your life it's the bitterness
[1:46:24] that you're harboring in your heart
[1:46:26] against your father that's keeping you
[1:46:28] from going into the presence of god
[1:46:30] because god can't feel a heart that's
[1:46:33] full of bitterness you've got to get
[1:46:35] that out of your life he said brother
[1:46:36] wayne how do i do it i said you go to
[1:46:38] that mean no daddy of yours and you buy
[1:46:40] him a gift that you that you think that
[1:46:42] he would really like and let it cost you
[1:46:45] a little something and you go to him and
[1:46:47] give it to him and tell him you love him
[1:46:49] and you thank him for every meal he ever
[1:46:51] gave you forever payment he ever made
[1:46:53] for every day he ever went to work i
[1:46:55] said forget about the trouble the man
[1:46:57] raised you he fed you he housed you he
[1:47:00] got you to where you are amen and and
[1:47:02] when i said that he said i can't do it
[1:47:05] i can't do it now now he if he gets this
[1:47:08] it's all right amen i'd like him to hear
[1:47:10] it anyhow amen and right now today he's
[1:47:12] in a world of sin and messed up his life
[1:47:16] because he could not do a simple thing
[1:47:19] of letting it go out of his life now
[1:47:22] listen i know we look at a lot of
[1:47:24] problems amen but don't you overlook
[1:47:26] that bitterness that settles in lives
[1:47:28] and hearts and so many young people
[1:47:30] trying to get the holy ghost and they
[1:47:32] can't get above the bitterness that the
[1:47:34] old devil has put in them against being
[1:47:36] mistreated or how they were treated in a
[1:47:38] certain place or what they did or amen
[1:47:40] forget it anyhow it's not worth your
[1:47:43] life it's not worth your home it's not
[1:47:46] worth everything in your life let go of
[1:47:48] the thing and let god fill you with the
[1:47:50] holy ghost and god can change everything
[1:47:54] that happens around now now you say
[1:47:56] preacher i'm going to need some bible i
[1:47:58] love the bible don't you it's the
[1:48:00] potential of the church he said looking
[1:48:02] diligently lest any man would follow the
[1:48:05] grace of god
[1:48:07] lest any root of bitterness springing up
[1:48:10] would trouble you
[1:48:11] or have
[1:48:12] he says thereby many defiled
[1:48:17] thereby many of the file now watch this
[1:48:20] bitterness is a defilement
[1:48:23] don't let it spring up it's now here's
[1:48:25] the thing about bitterness it grows
[1:48:27] quicker than morning glory
[1:48:31] it grows quick
[1:48:33] you can be
[1:48:34] pretty good buddies with somebody and
[1:48:36] meet them out in the parking lot and not
[1:48:38] shake their hand right and before they
[1:48:39] get in the car they're already
[1:48:40] criticizing you
[1:48:43] because it springs up so quick now look
[1:48:46] at what paul was saying to us don't let
[1:48:48] it spring up and defile you now people
[1:48:50] say well brother wayne it's really you
[1:48:52] know it's just a little problem i have
[1:48:53] and it's not a real issue let me let me
[1:48:55] let me let me dig in a minute
[1:48:57] and christ the mystery of god revealed
[1:48:59] paragraph 86
[1:49:01] if the brother you think is a little
[1:49:02] wrong or the sister
[1:49:04] you say lord don't never let me have the
[1:49:07] root of bitterness spring up
[1:49:09] because it will affect him
[1:49:11] and it'll take the christ
[1:49:14] right out of my life
[1:49:16] can you imagine
[1:49:18] to let something in your heart
[1:49:21] to take christ out of it
[1:49:24] amen the poison acids of malice and
[1:49:26] jealousy and hatred
[1:49:28] will take the holy spirit right away
[1:49:30] from you
[1:49:31] and it'll run him from the tabernacle
[1:49:34] it'll kill the spirit of god it'll drive
[1:49:36] it away from here it will hurt
[1:49:39] your pastor
[1:49:41] isn't that amazing
[1:49:43] now i'm going to deal with something
[1:49:44] just for a moment
[1:49:46] the spirit of bitterness goes right
[1:49:47] after the ministry
[1:49:50] every time
[1:49:51] sometimes when someone has a word of
[1:49:54] criticism i want you to stop and think
[1:49:56] about where it's coming from
[1:50:00] so preacher what are you doing i want to
[1:50:01] show you something
[1:50:03] if you hear something bad about a
[1:50:06] certain person don't ever hear it
[1:50:08] without looking at the source
[1:50:13] because the source may have a reason
[1:50:15] they're trying to tear down
[1:50:17] because that ministry is exposing
[1:50:21] ninety percent of the criticism with
[1:50:23] ministry generally is a spirit has been
[1:50:25] corrected and they don't take the
[1:50:27] correction and instead of taking the
[1:50:29] correction they turn and attack the
[1:50:31] vessel doing the correcting now i'm a
[1:50:33] preacher i know
[1:50:34] amen and the beauty of it is generally
[1:50:36] the ministry has enough grace that they
[1:50:38] don't go tell the whole church why they
[1:50:41] are correcting but the critical spirit
[1:50:43] makes sure they tell the church and they
[1:50:45] tell the world and they tell everybody
[1:50:47] everything it's because their intent is
[1:50:49] to destroy the voice that would correct
[1:50:52] them but watch what a prophet does he
[1:50:54] says now watch he said it will hurt the
[1:50:57] pastor it will hurt the church it will
[1:51:00] hurt the life don't you ever let a
[1:51:01] bitterness get in your soul it'll canker
[1:51:03] you i don't care how much people hate
[1:51:06] you you love them anyhow
[1:51:09] i don't care what they think about you
[1:51:11] you love them anyhow now watch this
[1:51:13] because unforgiveness it brings
[1:51:15] bitterness unforgiveness breeds it
[1:51:18] breached criticism unforgiveness buried
[1:51:21] things in your life it starts as
[1:51:23] unforgiveness but it ends up something
[1:51:25] much different amen it ends up with
[1:51:28] families out of church
[1:51:30] now if you will poll it tonight or this
[1:51:32] morning i guarantee you there are
[1:51:34] families not just this church but all
[1:51:36] over the world there are families in
[1:51:38] this church didn't leave over doctrine
[1:51:42] they don't leave over worship
[1:51:45] they leave because they got their
[1:51:46] feelings hurt
[1:51:48] we've got families in ohio leave because
[1:51:51] they get their feelings hurt
[1:51:53] you got families in tennessee go
[1:51:54] somewhere because they get their
[1:51:55] feelings hurt you got people now i'm
[1:51:57] just going to preach to you this morning
[1:51:59] because the devil's the devil and we
[1:52:00] might as well just call that devil out
[1:52:05] don't
[1:52:06] i don't want to be uncomfortable let's
[1:52:08] make the devil uncomfortable
[1:52:11] it's it's and you can you can ask me and
[1:52:13] say was there a doctor no problem no sir
[1:52:15] uh was was was there some trouble
[1:52:17] spiritual worship oh no sir what was it
[1:52:20] well so-and-so said something to me and
[1:52:21] this said that and the next thing you
[1:52:23] know you see that a spirit is moved a
[1:52:28] family or moved a people out from under
[1:52:30] a good ministry to get them in a place
[1:52:33] where the devil can tell them anything
[1:52:35] they want they can treat them any way
[1:52:37] they want and there's nobody there a god
[1:52:39] called pastor is to beat the devil off
[1:52:41] of you he's to stand there and take his
[1:52:44] sword and smack that devil so you can
[1:52:46] live free that you can live hard that's
[1:52:48] why oh god have mercy can i preach can i
[1:52:51] preach amen that's why they they have
[1:52:54] replaced the ministry with tapes because
[1:52:56] no tape ever offends anybody they can
[1:52:58] shut it off because the tape don't look
[1:53:00] in your eyes and discern what's going on
[1:53:02] with you a tape don't take a text and
[1:53:05] walk down and say if you don't get that
[1:53:06] devil off of you you're going you ain't
[1:53:08] gonna get right now he meant because the
[1:53:10] tape has played to a congregation but a
[1:53:12] preacher is a man of god that sees a
[1:53:15] spirit moving in a church or moving on a
[1:53:18] life and he says i'm not going to let
[1:53:20] that devil take that family i'm not
[1:53:22] going to let that devil hold them people
[1:53:24] so he comes against the spirit and the
[1:53:27] devil turns all hell against him but as
[1:53:30] the church of the living god you are to
[1:53:32] be trained enough to tell that devil i'm
[1:53:36] on the side of the lord i will not side
[1:53:39] with criticism and bitterness oh glory
[1:53:43] be to god i say let the power of love
[1:53:46] fill this room let it fill every heart
[1:53:49] because that's what we're going to
[1:53:50] experience in heaven
[1:53:55] now
[1:53:57] i know i know some people it seems like
[1:53:59] to me that they just got your button you
[1:54:02] know
[1:54:02] uh i'm glad the bible's here i'm glad
[1:54:05] the potential's here you know it's like
[1:54:07] uh you look at a car a corvette you say
[1:54:09] it can go from zero to 60 and 0.2
[1:54:12] seconds whatever it is i don't know but
[1:54:14] it's the potential of it right
[1:54:16] can it go and stop and go and stop
[1:54:18] electric cars got a potential of so far
[1:54:20] so you know that before you get it what
[1:54:22] the potential of it is
[1:54:24] right
[1:54:25] the potential
[1:54:26] of your ability to forgive is better
[1:54:28] than you think
[1:54:30] god god installed a christian
[1:54:33] as a as
[1:54:35] as a factory does a corvette he put a
[1:54:37] potential in you
[1:54:39] that can do more than you think it can
[1:54:41] but your potentials are recorded in the
[1:54:44] scripture
[1:54:45] and have told you what you're capable of
[1:54:47] if you just let god do it this is what
[1:54:50] you're capable of if god's driving your
[1:54:52] car
[1:54:53] look what he says jesus said unto them
[1:54:55] one time i i love it how peter peters
[1:54:58] he's the guy
[1:54:59] peter
[1:55:00] peter said lord you know about this
[1:55:02] forgiveness stuff
[1:55:05] who was it the other day said peter was
[1:55:07] wasn't aiming at the ear
[1:55:09] was that you
[1:55:09] [Laughter]
[1:55:11] he said he cut off his ear he said i
[1:55:12] don't think he's aiming his ear
[1:55:14] he's just a bad shot
[1:55:18] jesus is talking to peter of course and
[1:55:20] he's talking to peter about forgiveness
[1:55:23] peter said lord how much you know how
[1:55:24] much should we forgive he says well
[1:55:26] jesus said i say
[1:55:28] unto thee
[1:55:29] until seven times but until 70 times
[1:55:34] seven
[1:55:35] well that's good for a month
[1:55:37] yeah yeah yeah
[1:55:38] that'd be good for a year 490 times a
[1:55:40] year that's better than one a day
[1:55:42] yeah we'll take that that's okay lord
[1:55:46] he said no 70 times seven
[1:55:50] a day
[1:55:52] now that
[1:55:54] is potential
[1:55:57] you have the ability within you
[1:56:01] to forgive a trespass 490
[1:56:06] offenses in one day
[1:56:09] you are a powerful people
[1:56:16] now watch this
[1:56:18] 490 times meaning to me
[1:56:21] there's going to be a lot of offenses
[1:56:24] meaning to me if he built you this way
[1:56:27] there's a reason
[1:56:29] number one
[1:56:30] is many people are easily offended
[1:56:35] number two some people are just
[1:56:37] offendable
[1:56:39] there's some people some people says
[1:56:41] hello when you're offended
[1:56:46] i'm not really i'm not easily offended
[1:56:48] personally i'm really not you've got to
[1:56:49] let me know you're offending me i'm no
[1:56:50] dumb hillbilly you got to point it out
[1:56:52] to me
[1:56:54] otherwise i just think well i don't know
[1:56:56] what they meant with that and i just
[1:56:57] keep going you know
[1:56:59] it comes in handy sometimes you know
[1:57:01] i'm not really that offendable i'm
[1:57:02] really not
[1:57:03] but if you do offend me i'll forgive you
[1:57:06] now
[1:57:07] it means then that there's going to be a
[1:57:10] lot of offenses
[1:57:12] you could be offended up to 490 times in
[1:57:15] one day living in this earth
[1:57:18] now if you're a member of a church
[1:57:19] probably the chances go up
[1:57:26] offenses according to matthew 8 and 7
[1:57:30] he says offenses
[1:57:32] woe unto the world because of offenses
[1:57:34] for it must needs to be offenses come
[1:57:37] but woe unto the man whom the offenses
[1:57:39] cometh
[1:57:41] and look what he's saying unto us
[1:57:43] jesus made the promise offenses are
[1:57:45] coming
[1:57:47] can i can i just be real with you here a
[1:57:49] minute
[1:57:51] if you ain't been offended at the church
[1:57:53] you're gonna be
[1:57:56] if you haven't you're gonna be just hang
[1:57:58] around if the preacher don't get you the
[1:58:00] deacon will if the deacon don't get you
[1:58:02] the song leader will if the song leader
[1:58:04] don't get you one of the trustees well
[1:58:06] one of the truth somebody's going to
[1:58:07] offend you before you get done you
[1:58:09] you're going to be offended jesus said
[1:58:11] it's coming
[1:58:12] so offenses are coming but here's the
[1:58:14] thing
[1:58:15] god give you a way to deal with the
[1:58:18] offenses
[1:58:19] he said
[1:58:20] 490 times a day i can let offenses come
[1:58:24] into my life and they'll go out the
[1:58:26] exhaust
[1:58:27] 490 times a day i have the capacity for
[1:58:31] you to offend me
[1:58:33] 490 times and at 900 490 times and not
[1:58:38] have to carry one home at bed at night
[1:58:41] i have the ability to lay my head on the
[1:58:44] pillar at night not being offended or
[1:58:47] have been offended i can just go to
[1:58:50] sleep because i didn't let the sun go
[1:58:52] down on my wrath you are a great
[1:58:55] built church of the living god built so
[1:58:58] as offenses can come through you and out
[1:59:01] of you and not hinder the movement of
[1:59:04] the spirit of god at all i tell you what
[1:59:07] i love a church that knows how to
[1:59:08] worship i love a church that knows how
[1:59:10] to dance and shout and praise god i do i
[1:59:13] know there's a lot of people seems like
[1:59:14] it's plum it's offensive it seems like
[1:59:16] it's offensive to them well we're sorry
[1:59:18] brother amen but you recognize i
[1:59:20] recognize something about a church that
[1:59:22] knows how to rejoice knows how to shout
[1:59:24] what that means is you've learned how to
[1:59:26] put stuff aside and come to church
[1:59:28] because the devil's going to put enough
[1:59:30] on you to make sure you don't get here
[1:59:33] if you'll let him i was just talking to
[1:59:35] brother ron the other day we were down
[1:59:36] there i'm sure he probably told you as
[1:59:38] his church but we were down there
[1:59:39] holding that meeting with him with
[1:59:41] brother sean martin's meetings and he
[1:59:43] said he threw up on the way eight times
[1:59:46] stopped and throwed up eight times on
[1:59:48] the way his sister connie i guess it was
[1:59:50] said to him said well do we need to turn
[1:59:52] around and go back home are you sure you
[1:59:54] want to go he said no i want to go to
[1:59:55] the pulpit
[1:59:57] because i don't want the devil to learn
[1:59:59] that's all it takes to keep me out of
[2:00:01] the pulpit because if he learns that
[2:00:03] then i'm going to be throwing up every
[2:00:05] time church comes do you see what it is
[2:00:07] he wasn't allowing the devil to find a
[2:00:10] pattern in his life where he was
[2:00:12] stoppable i'm preaching to you now some
[2:00:15] of you are easy
[2:00:17] some of you only thing has to happen is
[2:00:19] somebody put a mean tweet out about you
[2:00:21] say a little something on facebook about
[2:00:23] you say a little something on instagram
[2:00:25] about you somebody don't shake your hand
[2:00:27] and you're all tore up and you don't
[2:00:29] even want to come to the house of god
[2:00:31] and the devil don't have to do more than
[2:00:33] that you're easy
[2:00:35] but what you want to do is become
[2:00:37] unoffendable say satan don't matter what
[2:00:40] you do don't matter what you say don't
[2:00:42] matter what happens i'm going to the
[2:00:44] house of god on sunday and i'll tell you
[2:00:46] what i'm not just going to go there and
[2:00:48] sit with my hands in my lap like a sour
[2:00:51] grape i'm going to stand up my feet and
[2:00:53] i'm going to shout glory i'm going to
[2:00:55] let every devil out of hell know you can
[2:00:58] throw everything you got at me but
[2:01:00] brother i'm going to keep coming i'm
[2:01:02] going to keep shouting i'm going to keep
[2:01:04] praising because i am built to please my
[2:01:08] god i am built as a son of the living
[2:01:11] god to not be stopped by some sinful
[2:01:14] little offense or trouble or trial i
[2:01:16] tell you amen i'll tell you this i don't
[2:01:18] want the devil to hold me under
[2:01:20] something so easy
[2:01:24] if he's going to get me he's going to be
[2:01:25] working brother
[2:01:28] it ain't going to be because somebody
[2:01:29] said a little something mean about me
[2:01:33] they made a video about me well they
[2:01:34] made one about your pastor too
[2:01:37] that just means we must be hitting hell
[2:01:39] good
[2:01:40] we must be a danger
[2:01:42] i tell you they say well if you don't
[2:01:44] quit preaching like that they're going
[2:01:46] to start doing this let me tell you i'm
[2:01:47] not going to quit preaching i'm gonna
[2:01:49] make more tapes than ever i'm gonna
[2:01:51] preach harder than ever i'm gonna speak
[2:01:53] more than ever i'm gonna talk about
[2:01:55] miracles and the power of god and divine
[2:01:58] gifts and a living jesus christ if you
[2:02:00] think you can stop us with a little
[2:02:02] mockery or making fun you have picked
[2:02:05] the wrong church you have picked the
[2:02:07] wrong preachers because we get up in the
[2:02:09] morning and say where you at devil were
[2:02:12] you at devil amen because you're looking
[2:02:15] for a devil to squash
[2:02:19] [Applause]
[2:02:23] now i wish we were divine all the time
[2:02:26] but the beauty of it is god built you
[2:02:28] not just divine he built you human
[2:02:30] so he built you to coexist with humanity
[2:02:32] and divinity at the same time
[2:02:35] there's a real powerful sermon you
[2:02:36] should look into it sometime on glo fish
[2:02:40] it's a powerful
[2:02:42] it's a powerful thought i don't have
[2:02:44] time to preach it this morning but
[2:02:46] but what it is is that
[2:02:49] if you want
[2:02:50] something to act a certain way
[2:02:53] and it's beyond its nature you have to
[2:02:54] give it another nature
[2:02:58] glowfish particularly they wanted in
[2:03:01] india to be able
[2:03:02] to identify poison water without test
[2:03:06] so they decided they would build a fish
[2:03:09] that when a fish was in the water
[2:03:11] you could look down at the water if that
[2:03:13] fish is glowing
[2:03:15] the water is undrinkable
[2:03:17] now that glow fish problem is there's no
[2:03:19] fish glow right
[2:03:21] so but they had it has to be a fish you
[2:03:23] can't use it if it's not a fish
[2:03:25] so they had to find a fish that has the
[2:03:28] ability to exhibit a dual nature
[2:03:31] so they go out in the ocean and find a
[2:03:33] jellyfish he's in the deeps and
[2:03:35] jellyfish glow they have a luminous
[2:03:37] so they took the luminous
[2:03:39] from the
[2:03:40] jellyfish
[2:03:42] and they inserted it in a little fish
[2:03:44] problem is finding one that could do it
[2:03:47] do you know what they did they found a
[2:03:48] simple little fish in india
[2:03:50] the simplest of all the fish
[2:03:53] but it was the only fish that could
[2:03:54] exhibit dual nature so the scientist
[2:03:57] took it in a little room
[2:04:00] he took it in a little room
[2:04:03] and and in secrecy
[2:04:05] he injected in the inner being of that
[2:04:08] light and then of course then he comes
[2:04:11] out to exhibit the light
[2:04:13] he puts it in a in a tank
[2:04:15] and he shuts all the lights off
[2:04:18] and then they add a little poison to the
[2:04:19] tank
[2:04:20] now the little fishinger might be
[2:04:22] thinking why they shut the lights off
[2:04:24] but it's the scientists wanting to
[2:04:26] exhibit
[2:04:27] his intelligence that has been
[2:04:29] transferred into this simple little fish
[2:04:32] he's wanting everybody to see
[2:04:34] his great mind was able to exhibit dual
[2:04:38] nature in something
[2:04:40] and so has god desired
[2:04:43] for you as a human
[2:04:45] to exhibit a divine nature
[2:04:48] so he didn't make you a god in that he
[2:04:51] left you in humanity
[2:04:53] but he put
[2:04:55] his own nature in you
[2:04:58] now he couldn't just put it on your skin
[2:04:59] because first time he took a shower he'd
[2:05:01] go
[2:05:02] he couldn't just put it in your spirit
[2:05:04] because he's five gates to get to it so
[2:05:06] he had to put it in the soul so that the
[2:05:08] soul would be in a place that it could
[2:05:11] exhibit from the soul realm
[2:05:13] the inner inside of inside and so what
[2:05:15] he did is he gave you that nature now by
[2:05:18] changing that nature he gives you the
[2:05:20] ability to escape
[2:05:23] now i want to just say this something to
[2:05:25] you
[2:05:26] as a human
[2:05:28] you're you're uh you're you're easy
[2:05:32] okay as a human because satan has been
[2:05:34] studying the human nature for six
[2:05:36] thousand years
[2:05:38] uh zach sitting over there me and him
[2:05:39] used to contract my nephews we we took a
[2:05:41] boat and put in spring river and we'd
[2:05:43] float and sit and all this well one day
[2:05:46] one day me and zach was over there and
[2:05:48] he set in a trap and i said son that
[2:05:49] won't work and he said dad i think it
[2:05:51] will
[2:05:52] i said no son that won't work he said i
[2:05:53] think it will
[2:05:55] i said what's your trap i kind of little
[2:05:56] arrogantly you know what's your trap
[2:05:59] leave it empty if you want to you know
[2:06:01] so i walked off and got in the boat come
[2:06:03] back next morning big old cone in that
[2:06:05] trap
[2:06:06] i was like well i guess i got a little
[2:06:08] learn
[2:06:12] my granddad trapped
[2:06:14] and he taught me how to trap a raccoon
[2:06:17] sitting on his couch he was getting
[2:06:18] older
[2:06:19] and he'd tell me he'd say son the thing
[2:06:21] about a raccoon that makes him trappable
[2:06:23] is that he keeps habits
[2:06:25] and a creature of habit makes him
[2:06:27] trappable
[2:06:28] he said because you can track him
[2:06:31] he said so what you do is you learn his
[2:06:33] patterns and his habits and you use his
[2:06:36] own pattern to get him
[2:06:38] he said what you do is you got to learn
[2:06:40] you got to learn and this is his saying
[2:06:42] he said you got to learn him to find
[2:06:43] where he's got his foot stuck out
[2:06:46] now what that means is now think about
[2:06:48] this young people
[2:06:50] you've got to make
[2:06:51] a raccoon his foot's this big
[2:06:54] you've got to make him put his foot in
[2:06:56] that spot
[2:06:58] and how many how many acres
[2:07:00] of ground is in this state
[2:07:03] he could put his foot anywhere in this
[2:07:05] whole state
[2:07:07] but you're predicting he'll put it in a
[2:07:09] spot that big around
[2:07:11] he could turn and go anywhere he wanted
[2:07:13] to
[2:07:14] he could do anything he wants
[2:07:16] but if you're a trapper you learn the
[2:07:19] nature of that animal and you can follow
[2:07:21] that and say right here i'll catch him
[2:07:23] right here now the thing about um
[2:07:25] think about a creek bank
[2:07:27] or a creek or something like that
[2:07:28] there's places how many y'all ever seen
[2:07:29] old creek you you live by them been by
[2:07:31] them and everything else if you ever
[2:07:32] notice that there's little sand bars in
[2:07:34] the creek
[2:07:35] like a little sand bar like this and
[2:07:36] then and then all of a sudden there's a
[2:07:38] bluff bank
[2:07:39] you ever seen that and you look down the
[2:07:41] creek bank and the whole thing's a bluff
[2:07:42] and there's a big nice tree sitting on
[2:07:44] the side now what a what a raccoon will
[2:07:46] do is when it comes to a sandbar he'll
[2:07:49] walk high and low like this
[2:07:51] so you can set a trap there it'll be
[2:07:52] empty from now on
[2:07:54] because he'll walk this way and he'll
[2:07:56] walk that way you come up to another
[2:07:58] spot and gravel bar and he'll walk this
[2:07:59] way and he'll walk that way but when
[2:08:01] that bank turns up
[2:08:03] it turns flat like this and the water's
[2:08:05] running next to it well a by nature
[2:08:08] he'll only walk about elbow deep in that
[2:08:10] water
[2:08:11] so if you look down next to that bank
[2:08:13] you'll see the tracks from last night or
[2:08:16] the night before and when you see them
[2:08:18] tracks you know that's his trail right
[2:08:20] there
[2:08:21] so what you do is you can follow him a
[2:08:22] mile up that creek bank and not have no
[2:08:25] spot to get him but when you get to that
[2:08:27] spot right there now you got him so you
[2:08:30] just set a trap right there and you
[2:08:32] don't have to set a trap down there you
[2:08:34] don't have to set a trap up there that
[2:08:36] one trap's going to get him and it's a
[2:08:38] sure-fired place because he's going to
[2:08:39] put his foot in it right there that's
[2:08:41] what's going to get him which teaches us
[2:08:44] that the devil can pattern your life
[2:08:47] the devil now what he'll do is he'll
[2:08:50] trail you
[2:08:52] he'll watch you daily
[2:08:54] and being a trapper he don't even want
[2:08:56] you to know that he has a trap laid
[2:08:59] what the devil will do is he'll watch
[2:09:01] your life and watch for the patterns and
[2:09:04] he's looking for that one spot
[2:09:07] he's just looking for that place where
[2:09:08] you got your foot stuck out or where
[2:09:10] you're you're off of guard that little
[2:09:12] weak spot he's looking for that one
[2:09:13] little place and the thing about the
[2:09:15] devil is he don't care if he gets you
[2:09:17] when you're 20
[2:09:18] or you're 30 or you're 40. sometimes
[2:09:21] he'll follow a sister till she hits
[2:09:24] menopause and he'll know i'll get her in
[2:09:26] menopause sometimes he'll watch me and
[2:09:28] he'll say when they get to the change of
[2:09:30] life he's going to want i'm going to get
[2:09:32] him right there and he knows exactly by
[2:09:34] human nature he don't have to get you he
[2:09:37] don't have to get you it's your it's
[2:09:38] your time you'll think he's going to do
[2:09:40] this or he's going to do it he's just
[2:09:41] waiting to find that spot in your life
[2:09:44] because you're a human being he's
[2:09:46] waiting for that moment in your life
[2:09:48] where you stick your foot in that trap
[2:09:50] now i'm a trapper we me and zach we've
[2:09:52] trapped that old spring river a bunch of
[2:09:53] times and and what we really wanted to
[2:09:55] catch was an otter because the otters
[2:09:57] paid the most you know they they was the
[2:09:58] most pain we i hope y'all don't shoot me
[2:10:01] i hope no peter's here this morning
[2:10:03] y'all okay with me
[2:10:07] they'll be blocking this off of the
[2:10:08] internet
[2:10:09] uh but but we were we were we wanted to
[2:10:11] trap otter because that was the best
[2:10:13] money but now them traps we had i don't
[2:10:15] know what we get for them traps 25 30
[2:10:17] probably for them good traps and and we
[2:10:19] would we would find a spot where the
[2:10:21] otter was on the bank or slides in a
[2:10:22] water slide so we'd find a good spot we
[2:10:25] set the trap
[2:10:27] them dudes took our traps i would they
[2:10:28] take two or three
[2:10:29] they take two or three of our traps what
[2:10:31] they are otter's so strong
[2:10:33] if you set your trap they'll jump off in
[2:10:35] the water and they'll spin they'll just
[2:10:37] spin like this and when they spin
[2:10:39] they'll break the wire off the trap
[2:10:41] that's that's got it tied down they just
[2:10:42] take your trap and go with them because
[2:10:44] they're almost uncatchable the only way
[2:10:46] you can catch an otter is that you got
[2:10:47] to put him in a kill trap or you have to
[2:10:49] drown him you have to have a slide and
[2:10:51] drown him but we thought we could
[2:10:52] outsmart him and just catch him so the
[2:10:54] point i'm saying to you is that we don't
[2:10:56] want to just catch something
[2:10:59] you want to keep something so when you
[2:11:01] sit in your trap you do it so as that
[2:11:04] not just to trap this animal you're not
[2:11:06] looking just to trap him and he'd pull
[2:11:08] his foot out or whatever because if he
[2:11:10] ever does that one time you'll never
[2:11:11] catch him after that because he'll know
[2:11:12] that trap from now on so you you don't
[2:11:15] do any of that but you put it so as when
[2:11:17] it sets it'll catch him and it'll hold
[2:11:20] him
[2:11:21] you see what the devil is trying to do
[2:11:22] he don't want to just catch you
[2:11:24] he wants to hold you
[2:11:27] he wants to hold you i i i ca
[2:11:30] can i can i preach a minute
[2:11:32] i see men that left their families now
[2:11:35] get this i talked to a brother one time
[2:11:37] he was a brother he left his family and
[2:11:40] went with another woman and started
[2:11:42] living with that woman and and while he
[2:11:44] was living with her i went to him and
[2:11:45] talked to him and i said brother you got
[2:11:48] to go home you got babies at home you
[2:11:50] got you they need their daddy and i
[2:11:52] started talking to him he said but
[2:11:54] brother he said what about this lady
[2:11:55] what he said i've got her out here in
[2:11:57] this mess and i'm responsible for and
[2:11:59] all that and i laughed i said look at
[2:12:00] that devil what he's doing to you
[2:12:03] you have left your responsibility and
[2:12:06] that now the devil's making you feel
[2:12:08] responsible for this brother you're not
[2:12:10] responsible for this you're responsible
[2:12:12] for your wife and children and listen
[2:12:14] let me tell you this the devil will make
[2:12:16] you feel like you're responsible for
[2:12:19] something that don't even belong to you
[2:12:21] you got to get tied up in some mess that
[2:12:23] don't even have nothing to do with you
[2:12:25] amen get your get your priorities in
[2:12:28] line and know that god's called you to
[2:12:30] be a father and a husband amen and get
[2:12:33] yourself in your oh god
[2:12:39] now now you you see the devil don't want
[2:12:41] to just catch your brother he wants to
[2:12:42] keep you he wants to get you in a place
[2:12:44] he can keep you and you find out this
[2:12:47] amen brother branham tells us the nature
[2:12:49] he said that old he didn't trap him
[2:12:51] with his foot out the way brother ram
[2:12:53] trapped him is he put nails in her log
[2:12:55] y'all heard about him tell it he put
[2:12:57] nails in a log and put a little shiny
[2:13:00] thing up there and when the moon would
[2:13:02] flash you'd see that shine back in there
[2:13:04] and oh will reach his hand back in
[2:13:06] there and he he can get his hand in now
[2:13:08] but when he gets a hold of it he'll grip
[2:13:10] it
[2:13:11] and he can't pull his hand out and that
[2:13:14] that crazy will hold on to that and
[2:13:18] a hunter coming after him he can see the
[2:13:20] hunter coming up the bank and he won't
[2:13:22] let go of it listen to me the devil
[2:13:25] knows you're in the trap he sees you
[2:13:27] there and he's coming after you don't
[2:13:30] hold on to it amen let go of the thing
[2:13:33] this morning let go of it i don't care
[2:13:36] who did it who's right who's wrong don't
[2:13:39] make no difference let go of the thing
[2:13:41] and run for your life run to jesus
[2:13:44] christ and let the power of god take a
[2:13:47] hold of this situation in your life
[2:13:49] listen i i i i know people people
[2:13:52] probably think i'm insane wait amen but
[2:13:54] unforgiveness is a prison to you
[2:13:57] it's just it's as bad as if you had a
[2:14:00] jail and a bar and a prison because you
[2:14:03] get away from your friends you isolate
[2:14:06] yourself from your church you isolate
[2:14:08] yourself from people that can help you
[2:14:10] you've got friends you've talked to for
[2:14:11] years but you can't even talk to them
[2:14:13] because of unforgiveness you're in a
[2:14:16] prison you're a prisoner to the thing
[2:14:20] you said brother wayne
[2:14:22] now and i'm going to talk to you out of
[2:14:23] the scriptures in case you don't think
[2:14:25] i'm crazy man jesus said there actually
[2:14:27] was a parable of a man that owed a man a
[2:14:29] lot of money
[2:14:32] and he went to the man
[2:14:34] and he said will you forgive me this
[2:14:35] great debt
[2:14:37] i forget the numbers i've got some
[2:14:38] numbers written down here i don't know
[2:14:40] if it's exact but it's but it's a just
[2:14:42] to show you the contrast
[2:14:44] it was about 3.4 billion dollars
[2:14:47] he owed
[2:14:49] in today's money
[2:14:50] and he said will you forgive me and man
[2:14:52] said yeah i'll forgive you let him go
[2:14:54] home
[2:14:55] the same man
[2:14:57] had a servant that owed him
[2:15:00] and it was ten thousand talents which is
[2:15:03] about
[2:15:05] six hundred thousand dollars in modern
[2:15:07] money
[2:15:09] and instead of forgiving that man
[2:15:11] he had him beat
[2:15:14] now watch what happens
[2:15:17] when the fella heard
[2:15:19] that you beat a man for six hundred
[2:15:21] thousand dollars and i just forgave you
[2:15:23] 3.4 billion
[2:15:26] he said go get that man and bring him
[2:15:27] back up here
[2:15:30] and you said what in the world you think
[2:15:31] god's going to put us back in prison the
[2:15:33] prison is the unforgiveness
[2:15:37] see
[2:15:38] the prison it not forgiven
[2:15:41] is the prison
[2:15:44] it is literally the thing that keeps you
[2:15:47] out of fellowship
[2:15:50] you can you can kneel down and pray
[2:15:52] and there's a black sheep in front of
[2:15:54] you
[2:15:56] you can't get through you can't worship
[2:15:57] you can't get you can't get nothing from
[2:15:59] god because of that unforgiveness is
[2:16:02] there it literally becomes a prison unto
[2:16:05] them
[2:16:06] now i'm sitting here today preaching to
[2:16:08] you about offenses and 490 times a day
[2:16:11] and god give it to us i'll give you i
[2:16:13] give you a little figure 490 times a day
[2:16:16] it means every two minutes in a 24-hour
[2:16:18] day you sleep eight so there's 16 hours
[2:16:21] divided by 490 times in those six is two
[2:16:24] minutes
[2:16:26] so what that means is when someone
[2:16:27] offends you you've got two minutes to
[2:16:29] get rid of it before it starts hurting
[2:16:33] when somebody offends you you've got two
[2:16:35] minutes
[2:16:36] you can stomp and holler and get mad do
[2:16:39] whatever you want for two minutes
[2:16:41] after that two minutes let it go brother
[2:16:45] let it go and if you're married to
[2:16:47] somebody that's having trouble with it
[2:16:48] just tell them two minutes
[2:16:52] you heard the preacher
[2:16:54] [Applause]
[2:16:56] you don't have to say more than that i
[2:16:58] already said it just do
[2:17:02] two minutes that's all you got because
[2:17:05] it's so damaging to your life if you
[2:17:08] hold it in your heart over two minutes
[2:17:10] it begins to affect you
[2:17:12] it begins to change who you are and then
[2:17:14] now offenses come all the time but can i
[2:17:16] say this to you i'm talking to what i
[2:17:18] believe to be a tremendous congregation
[2:17:21] i respect your pastor your pastors i
[2:17:24] respect these men of god amen i respect
[2:17:26] your belief i i think this full gospel
[2:17:29] is a powerful church it's making an
[2:17:31] impact internationally in the message of
[2:17:33] the hour we love you think so highly of
[2:17:36] you so people say well why would you
[2:17:38] preach a sermon like that to this kind
[2:17:39] of congregation do you know it was jesus
[2:17:42] himself who spoke of john the baptist
[2:17:45] whenever it was that john the baptist
[2:17:47] got through in jail y'all remember it
[2:17:49] y'all remember what he got in jail for
[2:17:51] he was preaching on marriage and divorce
[2:17:53] and some people got mad at him amen and
[2:17:55] they had the power to put him in jail
[2:17:58] and they put him in jail and john was
[2:17:59] over there in jail and his eyes started
[2:18:02] dimming and look at how far and how
[2:18:05] offended he got at jesus he said is this
[2:18:07] him or do we need to get another one
[2:18:10] think of that
[2:18:11] john got so offended at jesus christ now
[2:18:14] you say why did he get offended brother
[2:18:16] mam said it's because it didn't work out
[2:18:17] the way john had it planned
[2:18:19] he said john had introduced jesus as a
[2:18:22] messiah with a fan in his hand and he
[2:18:25] would thoroughly purge the floor he was
[2:18:27] looking for jesus to completely
[2:18:30] destroy that bunch of pharisees and do
[2:18:33] away with all of them and now he had let
[2:18:36] god had let john fall into the hands of
[2:18:39] these men for preaching the gospel
[2:18:42] and brother braham said he was offended
[2:18:44] at jesus christ
[2:18:46] do you know what you know what actually
[2:18:48] that brother branham says he says that
[2:18:50] there's more people offended at jesus
[2:18:52] than there is in the whole world
[2:18:54] there's more people offended at jesus
[2:18:56] tonight than they are at any of us
[2:18:59] amen people are offended at him because
[2:19:02] things have not worked out the way they
[2:19:04] wanted them to sometimes we get
[2:19:06] situations we say it's going to be like
[2:19:08] this and going to be like this amen but
[2:19:10] the prayer said father not my will but
[2:19:14] thy will be done on earth as it is in
[2:19:16] heaven learn how to pray not what we
[2:19:19] will what god wills that we don't become
[2:19:22] offended at the god that gave us grace
[2:19:24] and mercy in this age when i look at
[2:19:26] this i see amen that what brother brahm
[2:19:29] says here he says they become offended
[2:19:31] now watch this they get offended too
[2:19:32] quick i love it when they go when john
[2:19:35] his disciples go to jesus and says he's
[2:19:38] asked now listen to this he's asked are
[2:19:40] you him or do we look for another and
[2:19:43] jesus never got angry what jesus did he
[2:19:46] said you boys go sit and watch the
[2:19:48] meeting
[2:19:50] and you go tell him what you've seen and
[2:19:52] heard
[2:19:53] and blessed is he
[2:19:56] that's not offended in me
[2:19:59] which was the 11th commandment remember
[2:20:00] the forgotten the forgotten beatitude
[2:20:03] was blessed is he that's not offended in
[2:20:05] me and
[2:20:07] john had said the worst thing he could
[2:20:09] say about jesus and jesus said there's
[2:20:12] not a greater man born of a woman than
[2:20:14] john the baptist
[2:20:15] listen to me and the greatest man born
[2:20:18] of a woman outside of jesus christ was
[2:20:21] offended at god
[2:20:23] don't tell me that you can get so big
[2:20:25] you can't get offended that you can't
[2:20:27] get offended at one another you can't
[2:20:28] get offended at god amen but the beauty
[2:20:31] of it is god has given us forgiveness
[2:20:33] this morning to let every offense go to
[2:20:36] let every trouble go
[2:20:37] now amen i'm going to be closing very
[2:20:40] quickly so what we see then is we see
[2:20:42] that there are stories in the scripture
[2:20:44] that expresses this attribute there is
[2:20:46] not a picture in the entire bible that
[2:20:49] would say more about forgiveness than
[2:20:51] joseph
[2:20:54] it is the greatest picture of
[2:20:56] forgiveness in the entire bible
[2:20:59] joseph never done anything to deserve
[2:21:02] being treated wrongly never none
[2:21:06] the bible says they hated him without a
[2:21:08] cause amen and they mistreated joseph
[2:21:10] for no reason whatsoever amen i'll tell
[2:21:13] you what brother brandon said it was he
[2:21:15] said it's because the devil knew the
[2:21:16] promised son was coming and he was
[2:21:18] trying to kill him before he got there
[2:21:19] so the anger that was in their heart the
[2:21:21] jealousy that come upon them was just
[2:21:23] because he was a spiritual man that's
[2:21:25] all it was because he was a spiritual
[2:21:27] man his brethren beat him his brethren
[2:21:30] stripped him his brethren throwed him in
[2:21:33] a in a pit and sold him
[2:21:37] he sold him into slavery church now i'm
[2:21:41] talking about some real stuff how would
[2:21:42] you feel if we took you out back and
[2:21:44] beat the snot out of you and sold you
[2:21:46] off into a bunch of
[2:21:48] that probably wasn't proper english but
[2:21:50] but y'all know what i meant hey man but
[2:21:52] they beat him amen and put him in that
[2:21:54] pit
[2:21:57] and then he left the pit maybe go get a
[2:22:00] little better and he goes to potiphar's
[2:22:01] house
[2:22:02] and they raise him up and a woman
[2:22:04] accuses him of something horrible that
[2:22:07] he never even done wrong
[2:22:09] and because they told a lie on him he
[2:22:12] ended up down there in a prison house
[2:22:15] the man was thoroughly mistreated you
[2:22:18] never read joseph ever amen coming back
[2:22:22] and saying well this is really what
[2:22:23] happened and this is how it took place
[2:22:25] and i tell you these people are horrible
[2:22:26] you never read that in the bible at all
[2:22:29] amen but because he was carrying a
[2:22:31] divine nature as a son of god he was the
[2:22:34] very example of jesus christ and he went
[2:22:37] through all of it and they couldn't put
[2:22:40] bitterness in him and because he had no
[2:22:42] bitterness they couldn't put any
[2:22:43] bitterness in him and it's one of the
[2:22:45] most powerful stories i know of when
[2:22:47] they took him out of the prison and they
[2:22:49] elevated a gift because of the character
[2:22:52] it had and they made him ruler in the
[2:22:55] land of egypt can you imagine when
[2:22:57] potiphar come riding by and seen him
[2:22:59] crowning joseph
[2:23:01] and he went home and he told his wife
[2:23:04] honey i hope you wasn't lying
[2:23:06] because that fellow that we put in jail
[2:23:07] has just become the second ruler in all
[2:23:10] of egypt
[2:23:13] once he got in position of power
[2:23:16] he could have done whatever he wanted
[2:23:21] he could have sought vengeance on
[2:23:23] potiphar's wife
[2:23:25] he could have took his brethren and had
[2:23:27] him sold asunder and thrown into the
[2:23:29] pits into the gators he could have done
[2:23:31] whatever he was in power but the reason
[2:23:35] he was in power is because of the
[2:23:38] character he had and if the right man is
[2:23:40] in power character will show forgiveness
[2:23:43] every time if you see the power of jesus
[2:23:46] christ in a man's life forgiveness is
[2:23:48] one of the attributes
[2:23:50] look what he did he never he never
[2:23:52] sought vengeance
[2:23:54] because he was an example
[2:23:58] of jesus christ
[2:24:02] brother wayne should i forgive someone
[2:24:03] who hasn't asked
[2:24:07] i don't know
[2:24:09] of a better example of this
[2:24:13] than the son of god
[2:24:18] now
[2:24:19] he's just been beaten
[2:24:22] beyond recognization
[2:24:26] he taught him to a pole and beat him
[2:24:29] until he can't walk
[2:24:33] he hasn't done anything wrong
[2:24:37] have a wrong man
[2:24:42] he's dragging his own cross
[2:24:48] and the people
[2:24:50] that he's going through this for
[2:24:53] are screaming
[2:24:55] crucify him
[2:25:04] it's there that a man named simeon
[2:25:06] or simon
[2:25:08] reach us down
[2:25:12] brother i'd like to have that
[2:25:13] opportunity when you
[2:25:16] he says i know you got to do this but
[2:25:17] let me help you carry it
[2:25:21] helped helped him carry that cross
[2:25:24] up that hill
[2:25:26] they took our lord
[2:25:28] by vision a prophet gave us a great look
[2:25:31] right into it out of the rock 55.
[2:25:34] he said i seen him going up the combo
[2:25:37] stone he said i can hear the bump
[2:25:40] of the cross as it goes
[2:25:42] he said i'm watching his garment
[2:25:45] he said one spot
[2:25:47] then another
[2:25:48] then another
[2:25:50] he said then it began to join itself
[2:25:52] together
[2:25:53] until it would become one blood
[2:25:56] soaked garment
[2:26:00] while that blood was dripping
[2:26:02] and he was walking
[2:26:04] they were screaming crucify him
[2:26:07] they were hailing him
[2:26:09] as a rejected king they were spitting
[2:26:11] mocking
[2:26:12] laughing
[2:26:14] he hasn't
[2:26:16] done no wrong
[2:26:21] he done nothing
[2:26:25] for what good work
[2:26:27] what'd he do
[2:26:30] i don't know crucify him
[2:26:33] something was driving them to get this
[2:26:35] man out of their midst
[2:26:38] they took him up there on that cross and
[2:26:41] he hangs
[2:26:42] he hangs there
[2:26:45] he hangs
[2:26:46] next
[2:26:47] to murderers
[2:26:50] to thieves
[2:26:56] he's hanging there
[2:27:00] we do a good job as a christian world of
[2:27:02] putting a little napkin over his
[2:27:04] privates and
[2:27:05] giving him a little dignity why he's on
[2:27:07] the cross
[2:27:09] but i'm sorry to say there was none that
[2:27:11] day
[2:27:16] he was stripped
[2:27:20] my lord hung naked before the crowd
[2:27:28] could you tell me why
[2:27:30] what'd he do
[2:27:34] while he was hanging there
[2:27:37] the blood soaked
[2:27:39] the blood-soaked hair dripping
[2:27:41] the blood running
[2:27:45] from there he could see him brother he
[2:27:46] could hear him
[2:27:48] the people he was sent to help
[2:27:51] was screaming crucify him
[2:27:54] they were spitting at him
[2:27:55] one of the most powerful scenes in in
[2:27:58] scripture
[2:28:00] they offer him bitterness
[2:28:02] have you ever ever studied it they
[2:28:04] offered him they offered him a drink he
[2:28:07] said i thirst and they offered him
[2:28:09] something do you know what he offered
[2:28:10] him they offered him a ragweed
[2:28:13] that is mixed with a certain chemical
[2:28:16] that it comes from the hemp
[2:28:18] that it kills pain it's in the sedative
[2:28:23] they offered him bitterness to deal with
[2:28:25] the pain
[2:28:28] listen to me they offered him bitterness
[2:28:31] to deal with the pain of rejection and
[2:28:33] crucifixion but he would not receive
[2:28:36] bitterness when it would even duel the
[2:28:38] hardest pains
[2:28:41] listen there's going to be times in your
[2:28:43] life pain's going to come people's going
[2:28:45] to do mean things it's going to save me
[2:28:47] things and satan's going to offer you
[2:28:49] some bitterness if you could just be mad
[2:28:51] at them if you could just be wrong if
[2:28:53] they could just be wrong and you could
[2:28:55] say mean things you wouldn't hurt
[2:28:57] anymore amen but if you just open up
[2:28:59] your arms your type is christ and he
[2:29:02] opened his arms and said to them father
[2:29:05] forgive them they don't know what they
[2:29:08] do look at this he forgave them while
[2:29:11] they were scheming crucify him while
[2:29:13] they were spitting and mocking and let
[2:29:15] me tell you that potential is in you
[2:29:17] that potential is in every person in
[2:29:19] this building that has received the holy
[2:29:21] ghost you don't have to have somebody

[2:29:28] forgive when nobody's asked for it you
[2:29:30] can give back when nobody has asked a
[2:29:33] thing because you are a christian

[2:29:40] of god i don't know what the devil's
[2:29:42] trying to hold on you this morning but i

[2:29:51] hang them by their own noose this
[2:29:52] morning we are to turn right on that
[2:29:54] devil and say i'll tell you what you try
[2:29:56] to keep me from loving my brother but
[2:29:58] i'm going to put my arm around him this
[2:30:00] morning i'm going to tell him i love him
[2:30:02] i'm going to tell my sister i love him

[2:30:17] that with you another day
[2:30:19] [Music]
[2:30:21] he stretched his arms
[2:30:23] and he took the sphere
[2:30:25] and as the blood from his side
[2:30:28] mixed
[2:30:30] with the blood from his back
[2:30:32] it dropped onto the ground
[2:30:35] and healing
[2:30:36] and forgiveness
[2:30:38] came at the same time
[2:30:42] it's mixed
[2:30:44] the bloodstream mixed healing
[2:30:47] and forgiveness

[2:31:42] they don't know what they do
[2:31:45] it was those great words

[2:31:54] the only man who was ever right
[2:31:57] became wrong
[2:32:00] so i could be go free
[2:32:06] the only man ever right not one of you
[2:32:08] is right this morning so i'm in an
[2:32:10] argument with somebody there's no right
[2:32:12] there's no right
[2:32:15] jesus
[2:32:16] jesus was right
[2:32:19] and he knew if he didn't forgive
[2:32:22] you couldn't go new rapture
[2:32:25] right
[2:32:29] i was riding
[2:32:30] brother ron was riding on an airplane
[2:32:32] home from canada some
[2:32:33] time ago and
[2:32:36] i was coming home from a meeting you
[2:32:37] know how monday's how you do sometimes
[2:32:39] and
[2:32:40] i'm just riding
[2:32:42] i was thinking
[2:32:45] i got to thinking about pardons and how
[2:32:47] people
[2:32:48] get pardons
[2:32:50] it's been 10 12 15 years sometimes in
[2:32:52] jail and they never even did it
[2:32:54] somebody figures out they didn't do it
[2:32:55] and they let them go
[2:32:58] i was thinking about all that and i got
[2:33:00] to think about spiritual pardons and
[2:33:02] i was thinking about it
[2:33:06] i thought but lord i
[2:33:09] i did it
[2:33:14] and in an instant
[2:33:16] on that airplane i'm sitting there
[2:33:17] thinking
[2:33:20] [Music]
[2:33:23] i know the scripture says you've never
[2:33:24] done it but lord i did
[2:33:27] i really did it
[2:33:30] i was
[2:33:31] [Music]
[2:33:33] it was there it was sin it was horrible
[2:33:36] i was there
[2:33:36] [Music]
[2:33:38] and i just bowed my heart i said god how
[2:33:40] could you ever
[2:33:43] brother
[2:33:44] i don't know if it was audible i don't
[2:33:46] know what it was but it was to me
[2:33:49] he said you
[2:33:51] are libra
[2:33:54] brother there was a power
[2:33:57] swept through that airplane i started
[2:33:59] bawling like a baby
[2:34:01] i imagine everybody in the plane thought
[2:34:03] i was insane i just started bawling like
[2:34:04] a baby
[2:34:06] [Music]
[2:34:08] because barabbas had no hope
[2:34:13] he had no way to get right
[2:34:17] but because of calvary
[2:34:20] he didn't have to go
[2:34:22] [Music]
[2:34:23] and this morning that same jesus christ
[2:34:25] is right here in this building
[2:34:30] blood still has the same power
[2:34:34] his grace still means just as much
[2:34:37] maybe there's a situation in your life
[2:34:39] today and you don't know how to get over
[2:34:40] it you don't know what to do
[2:34:45] he said if we sin against one another
[2:34:48] seven times 70 a day
[2:34:51] then our god has the same attribute
[2:34:56] he has the same ability
[2:34:59] and to think that a loving father this
[2:35:01] morning
[2:35:03] all you have to do is turn port home
[2:35:06] said lord i'm asking you i'm asking you
[2:35:08] to return to my life
[2:35:13] maybe there's something you need to
[2:35:14] correct in your life this morning
[2:35:16] offense something you've been letting go
[2:35:17] in your heart for a while
[2:35:20] and it's changing you
[2:35:23] it's making you a person you never were
[2:35:26] maybe right here this morning you'll say
[2:35:28] brother i want this to leave me
[2:35:31] this is not me i'm not a mean angry
[2:35:34] person
[2:35:37] it's not me
[2:35:41] as we bow our hearts this morning
[2:35:45] father i've delivered my heart to your
[2:35:47] children this morning
[2:35:50] father maybe someone here or someone
[2:35:51] watching
[2:35:53] maybe it'd be a blessing to them somehow
[2:35:57] father i pray though right now in this
[2:35:59] building
[2:36:01] i believe there's hearts here
[2:36:03] i believe there's needs here in this
[2:36:05] sanctuary
[2:36:07] maybe one don't know you just they never
[2:36:09] really gave their life but i pray right
[2:36:11] here this morning
[2:36:13] the lord they turn loose or whatever
[2:36:15] life they're living
[2:36:17] and they'd run to you
[2:36:19] father may be somebody trapped in a
[2:36:21] situation this morning that's got them
[2:36:23] it's holding them in sin
[2:36:25] and they just don't know how to get out
[2:36:26] i pray this morning they just let go
[2:36:29] and they run to you
[2:36:32] maybe the only enemy's tricked somehow
[2:36:34] has tricked them and brought them into a
[2:36:35] place where they're
[2:36:36] struggling to forgive i pray father the
[2:36:39] spirit of forgiveness would move in this
[2:36:41] building in such a powerful way
[2:36:44] [Music]
[2:36:46] but lord we would hear what joseph said
[2:36:49] we would hear what jesus said
[2:36:52] and it would become our words this
[2:36:53] morning
[2:36:54] now father i commit this to you
[2:36:57] in the name of jesus christ i pray
[2:37:01] amen and amen

[3:00:52] here with you and we set this meeting up
[3:00:55] and and in minds of of our liberty and i
[3:00:58] thought today my goodness if we've ever
[3:01:00] had the shackles broke off
[3:01:02] we ought to celebrate our victory just
[3:01:04] just now thanking the lord for it
[3:01:06] but we we wanted to have a fellowship
[3:01:09] dinner with our people we we have
[3:01:12] well outgrown our fellowship hall and we
[3:01:14] are steadily steadily searching but we
[3:01:17] we've found a few places that we can
[3:01:20] entertain some things and entertain some
[3:01:22] ideas just for the time being and those
[3:01:24] things weren't available this weekend
[3:01:26] and we're certainly thankful for the
[3:01:28] weirs cave community center that has
[3:01:29] allowed us every about every weekend us
[3:01:32] as a youth group to be able to go and
[3:01:33] interact there with our youth but they
[3:01:35] weren't available this weekend but
[3:01:37] sister wanda hinkle
[3:01:39] made access for us to be able to use
[3:01:41] spotswood high school today
[3:01:44] and that's where we'll be traveling to
[3:01:45] here just in a few moments and we're
[3:01:47] going to be having a fellowship dinner
[3:01:49] there and you don't necessarily maybe we
[3:01:51] don't always get the time to sit down
[3:01:52] and fellowship but that's what this this
[3:01:54] day is about this is about re restoring
[3:01:57] brotherhood and enjoying what we're
[3:01:58] going to be doing throughout the
[3:02:00] eternities so i'm going to give this
[3:02:02] address to you at the beginning of this
[3:02:04] speech and then at the ending if if you
[3:02:05] can listen this the address is 368

[3:02:30] you pull out here on 33 you just go
[3:02:32] straight up straight up 33 west there
[3:02:35] it's 10 miles on your right you'll see a
[3:02:37] sign it's what is it the fifth
[3:02:40] fifth stop light the fifth stop light on
[3:02:42] your right you pull in there
[3:02:44] and as you go in it's a big loop just
[3:02:46] stay to the right and follow that loop
[3:02:48] all the way around and there's all kinds
[3:02:50] of parking in there but i was told to
[3:02:52] tell you this do not park where the red
[3:02:55] lines are in the fire lane do not look
[3:02:58] at your neighbor said do not park in the
[3:03:00] fire lane
[3:03:02] because the fire marshal uses that as
[3:03:04] his access right there
[3:03:06] do not park there because you will get a
[3:03:10] ticket
[3:03:12] i don't believe anybody just after being
[3:03:14] forgiven wants to have another ticket on
[3:03:15] their name
[3:03:18] so just don't don't park there but we're
[3:03:20] certainly appreciative of spotswood high
[3:03:22] school allowing us to be able to use
[3:03:24] this facility and it fell in a perfect
[3:03:27] time and uh we're just certainly
[3:03:29] thankful to be able to use it it's a
[3:03:31] place where we can have fellowship
[3:03:32] dinner there's two different gyms that
[3:03:34] we'll be using
[3:03:35] and uh we'll we'll make some more
[3:03:37] comments at that place there at once we
[3:03:40] get there i know you're ready to eat
[3:03:42] we'll pray over that when we get there
[3:03:44] so we're all on the same page we'll put
[3:03:46] brother ron at the first line brother
[3:03:48] wayne right behind him that okay
[3:03:50] i'm glad you're on the same board of me
[3:03:52] now we're moving forward but as you
[3:03:54] enter into the school it's it's as
[3:03:56] you're looking at the entrance or the
[3:03:58] the school it's the left major entrance
[3:04:00] most of us know where to go we've been
[3:04:02] to a few of those ball games up there
[3:04:05] so we know where to go at it's where you
[3:04:07] go in and get your ticket go in there
