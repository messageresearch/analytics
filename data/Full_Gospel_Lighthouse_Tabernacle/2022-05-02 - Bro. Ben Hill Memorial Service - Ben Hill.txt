be seated i'd like to read from job chapter 14 beginning with verse 1 this evening it says man is born of woman in a few days and full of trouble he cometh forth like a flower and is cut down he fleeth also as a shadow and continueth not he dost thou open that eyes upon such and one and bringeth me into judgment with thee who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean thing not one seeing his days are determined the number of his months are with thee thou has appointed his bounds that cannot pass turn from him that he may rest until he shall accomplish as in hirling his day for there is hope of a tree if it be cut down it will sprout again and that the tender brunch thereof will not cease though the root thereof wax old in the earth and the stock thereof dying the ground yet through the scent of water it will bud and bring forth bounds like a bounce like a plant but a man dieth and wasteth away yay a man giveth the ghost and where is he as the waters fell from the sea and the flood decayeth and drieth up so a man lieth down and riseth not till the heavens be no more they shall not awake nor be risen out of their sleep oh that thou wouldest hide me in the grave that thou wouldest keep me secret until the wrath is be passed that thou would disappoint me a set time and remember me if a man die shall he live again all the days of my appointed time will i wait till my change come thou shall call and i will answer thee thou wilt have a desire for the work of thine hands for now thou numberst my steps dust thou not watch over my sin these scripture readings written by job as he would look forth as a vision and and say what would a man be like what is the life of a man and he turns to nature and he looks at nature how nature would would resurrect life once again and how that nature types the spiritual and he's explaining here as a tree would fall but it shall bring forth new life and so you'll notice of a morning of the sun comes up it's a baby it's raised or weak and as it comes through the teenage years about nine or ten o'clock and then about noon time the middle of the day it's in its full strength then it begins to fall and fail finally sunsets over the west and the dye and it dies out for the day could we call that the end of the sun no no the next morning it comes back again and brings a new day for us all now what is it it's god's expression the word expressed means to make known a feeling it's god's expression to us to let us know his feeling for us that death does not separate us eternally for we'll rise again and come back again amen as we see that the sun is going each and every morning each and every day a new day resurrection of life it's an expression of life an expression of what we behold you hear this this evening friends and family you're given an expression expression of brother ben as a son expression as a brother expression as a true friend you're expressing your love for him by showing up this evening and that's what god wants to do through us is express himself through us in each and every day yet we have beautiful flowers here and and before long they're gonna start to die and they'll fade away and we'll see that rain comes and washes the seeds down into the ground just a little bit maybe the fall comes freeze comes and and then here comes spring sun that would shine down and that seed of life that has went down into the ground is now beginning to bud forth once again an expression of life resurrection a life newness has come forth again and brother branham would say it like this and says the sun seems to many times be far away but when it begins to shine the sun of righteousness will shine with his healing wings and every life no matter where it is buried how deep how far the waters it is in the sands or the rocks it'll rise to glory with god because god is expressing to us showing us just what he's doing his purpose to show us through the flowers through the sun through the trees through all of life in his resurrection the life of god resurrecting his life when it serves its purpose in your life god's serving his purpose through you now these beautiful flowers here they they come in different varieties there's white flowers pink flowers certain flowers but each one of them is beautiful and we put them all together will make a beautiful bouquet now god loves each and every one of us and we're not all the same he loves a beautiful variety of life we he has big mountains and little hills plains and he has deserts and seas he has the oak tree the palm tree and everything blended together in its place where god god and all of nature can live and enjoy his being he's living in his creatures and times and serving his purposes if he thinks enough of a resurrection like that he made a way of escape for that for the service for the future for you and how much more has he for the people regardless of who they are what race color creed or what more dwell in united in god's purpose and his blessing there will be a resurrection someday just as sure as the resurrection of that flower that i was speaking about we all see that we all believe that this evening and they are testifying and telling us making it known that a feeling of god that he wants to show to you amen i love his resurrection power of what he can do in an instant time and a man's life i enjoyed and had the privilege of speaking last ben's last sermon that he would hear on easter weekend as he would sit there and come in the back there sit beside his dad and just enjoy service and worship you know it's it's a it's a beautiful beautiful thing how life will worship now this isn't the end this is only beginning now we just want to make that step towards christ and we want to be resurrected in his life his fullness of what he would want through us amen maybe we'll sing that song blessed be the name of the lord blessed be the name of the lord [Music] of the lord the name of the lord [Music]

never gave up on me oh you never gave up on me and you were my testimony [Music] oh you never gave up on me oh this is my testimony oh you were the voice in the desert calling me out from death [Music] lifting me up from the ashes carrying [Music] you [Music] amen god bless you this afternoon first i'd like to express my sincere sincerest condolences and sympathy to the family the hill family and all the friends that came here to honor brother ben hill this afternoon i'd like to read out of john 3 16 very familiar text for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god that's a text that most any sunday school that's one of the first scriptures that little children learn in sunday school and for a good reason because it's a very very powerful scripture because god did send god so loved the world that he sent his only begotten son in life we're free moral agents in life and life life's choices that we make bring us in very many different directions but god knows the weakness of humanity and god's mercies are new each and every day god is always ready and willing to forgive and he loves in ways that we cannot imagine he reaches down in places we cannot reach and his grace finds this out because we were all born in sin shaped in iniquity and we've come to this world speaking lies but the love of god found us he seeks for you and he's looking for you in john 14 jesus speaking his very own words he says i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you that's a promise it's a simple promise but god promised he won't leave you comfortless he'll come to you and he'll comfort you he'll comfort you in a way when all the friends are gone when everyone's had to go back to life he'll be there and he'll comfort you it's also important during this time to put any questions and worry aside we have to trust the power of the blood of jesus christ because like i said it reaches in places that we can only can't even begin to imagine in isaiah 55 the bible says seek ye the lord why he may be found call ye upon him while he is near let the wicked forsake his way in the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the lord and he will have mercy on him and to our god for he will abundantly pardon for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways saith the lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways in my thoughts than your thoughts when there's a death in the family there's always a temptation to ask why why this why that we must trust the lord because his ways are so much higher than our ways i didn't have the opportunity to personally know ben but i do know his family and i know that ben had many lighthouses in his life there was no shortage of lighthouses and friends and family that shine the true light and life and gospel of our lord jesus christ and i believe that these very lighthouses and the influence of these lighthouses brought ben to the house of god on his very last day i was up here and he brother matthew was preaching as he said brother ben sat in the back and he responded to the service when the worship was going on he raised his hand now we know we know that in order to make a reaction to reach out to the lord there must be something inside there must be something because gravity makes our hands hang down and there must be something in our heart speaking to us and i believe something spoke to him that made him reach out on what on whatever level god knows but i believe god spoke to him and i believe god i believe brother ben responded and i believe that these very light houses invents life and the investment the bible says to raise up a child in the way that he should go and many times in life it's a puzzle to us but i believe the way you raised brother ben made him come to the house of god maybe throughout life maybe choices that were made didn't look like things were paying off but in the end that's what matters because god is a merciful god and there's an influence of these christian lights and salvation is simple salvation is simple and god's how god has in simplicity because remember god doesn't condemn a man for being a sinner we've all come to the world being sinners but what what a sinner's condemned for is for refusing the way and there's a reason we have a picture of jesus right up there because he is the way he is the only way jesus said i am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and another place further down jesus said i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me in john 9 5 as long as i am in the world i am the light of the world he's the life he's the light he's the he's the truth the way he's the resurrection in saint john chapter six jesus speaking said verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me hath everlasting life i am that bread of life your fathers did eat men are in the wilderness and are dead this is the bread which came down from heaven that a man may eat thereof and not die i am the living bread which came down from heaven if any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that i will give is my flesh which i give for the life of the world the bible speaks of two deaths one is natural and the other is spiritual jesus came to save us from that second death which is eternal separation from god if time goes on we'll all go by way of the grave but by the grace of god and through the shed blood of jesus christ we can never be separated from god god is merciful and as i said god is our comforter and he's our god he promised to carry us through the hard times and he will it reminds me of that dream that man had where he was had a very troubling he had a dream that he was looking back on the sins of time on his life and through the hardest times he he dreamed that he was walking with the lord on the beach and there were two sets of footprints but during the toughest hardest times there was only one set and he asked the lord he said lord why is it during my most hardest times that you would leave me and only leave me one and there's only one set why would you leave me in the hardest times of my life and jesus responded to the man in the dream and he said it was then that i carried you so may he carry you and he will amen oh [Music] the winter storms may wait for spring [Music] in every season from where i'm standing i see the evidence of your goodness all over my life all over my life i see the promises and fulfillment all over my life all over my life [Music] help me remember when i'm weak fear may come but fearfully you lead my heart to victory [Music] you are my strength and you always will be i see the evidence of your goodness all over my life all over my life i see the promises in fulfillment all over my life [Music] i see the cross the empty grave the evidence is in this all my sin rolled away because of you o jesus see the cross the empty grave the evidence is endless all my sin rolled away cause of you o jesus i see the evidence of your goodness all over my life all over my life i see your promises in fulfillment all over [Music] thank you brother shannon amen to say thank you to each and every one of you that have come today to support the hill family in this time of crisis and i would like to offer to brother doug and sister donna my deepest sincerity and condolences unto you we do not plan for these things we definitely do not plan to bury our children before our time but god we rest in these promises that god is faithful and he is the author and the finisher of our faith the bible says in isaiah 53 who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of dry ground he hath no form nor commonness when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men he is a man of sorrows and acquaintance with grief when isaiah was writing these things and he caught the vision of who this was he was speaking of our lord but look at the the titles that he has given he is despised he is rejected of men a man of sorrows acquaint it with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of god and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed today we recognize and understand that we are serving a god who understands that the bible tells us that he was in all points he was tempted like as we are yet without sin i cannot relate to you on the level like jesus can relate to you i can understand the loss of a loved one or understand the loss of a family member but jesus understands your deepest and your darkest fears the bible will tell us that he he knew sorrow and grief so intimately that he would be called a man of sorrows this is among other reasons made him despised and rejected by men he made our griefs his own and our sorrows if they were his the image is that he loaded them and carried them on his back so that we wouldn't have to the bible tells us and gives us a title of this man that he was known by grief he was known by his troubles jesus was notorious for them these were his constant companions when disciples would leave him his familiar acquaintance was with grief so he understands today his life was one continued series of sorrows from the cradle to the cross in his infancy his life was sought for by herod and he was obliged to be taken by his parents and flee into egypt he ate his bread and sorrow and with his sweat of his brown he met with much sorrow from the hardness and unbelief of men's hearts and from the contradiction of sinners against himself even much from the forwardness of his own disciples much from the temptations of satan and as the surety of his people he was exceeding sorrowful in the garden when his sweat was as it were the great drops of blood and went on the cross with the sins of his people and the enduring pains and the agonies of a shameful and a cursed death he was made up of sorrows and made up of grief and how many people today carry around pain they carry around grief and they carry around sorrow when jesus is the one that carried them for you he took them for us but for it to do us any good we have to release our grief and we have to release our sorrow so if there is anyone here that can console you or comfort you today as a family it is none other than a man jesus christ a man who is acquainted with grief david would say that the lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart and saveth such as of a contrite spirit psalms 147 and says force 3 it said he healeth the broken in heart and he bindeth up their wounds he is and will forever be the healer of those that are broken to those that have been crushed by the calamities of life he is the healer he is the healer of those whose lives seem to be wrecked or crippled by circumstances whose hopes have been shattered and by pain and by despair by abuse and by struggles and when your heart feels like it can't go on and your heart is broken it feels like it's the end of the world like a knife has struck you right in your heart and the pain is so deep and it feels like there's a giant a giant hole he is the healer when you cry yourself to sleep he is the healer when you are broken he is the healer and he understands the heart of a mother he understands the heart of a father science even tells us that when you have a broken heart that your brain literally is telling your body that you are in pain when you are a friend and you're in pain god understands and the actually the area of the brain that lights up when you are hurt physically is the same area that lights up when you're suffering from a heartbreak when a surge of stress hormones strike it and calls the reaction called what science calls the heartbreak syndrome that can be caused by an emotional stressful event maybe the death of a loved one the loss of a child and every one of us we deal people deal with grief and they deal with pain differently some publicly and some privately but at the end of the day you have to deal with grief if not it will eat at you and it can destroy your spirit but as we have been told we must keep our spirit clean it's okay to understand and it's okay to maybe not understand and maybe ask the question why but jesus is the answer to your grief he's the answer to your pain and the wandering of our life jesus understands what we're going through jesus one time he walked he walked to a way and he was sitting down and he was having a meal with a family and there was there were some friends that came to him and said your friend lazarus is sick and he's going to the point of death but jesus stayed where he was at because he knew the will of the father and jesus stood there knowing all along what would take place and several days after the passing of lazarus jesus walked through a city and there martha met him and she spoke these words if you would have been here my brother would not have died jesus we know was all god he was definitely a man but yet he was all god he was tempted just like you're tempted and he had tears just like you have tears the bible said that when he come to mary and martha that he walked up to them and said where have you laid him at and the bible said that jesus wept to think that jesus was so close to humanity that almighty god wanted to come and and to take on humanity so that he could feel like brother doug and could feel like sister don and sister tracy and sister heather and sister jenny to understand what you're going through he had to robe himself in humanity and as jesus makes his way to the tomb of lazarus where here was one of his best friends in life and jesus begins to weep maybe we would see and maybe we would understand just for a moment that jesus maybe he was weeping because he was going to have to bring him back to the life of trouble to the life of turmoil to the life of crisis and jesus was weeping but he was moved by a man and some would say that that would prove that he was a man and he wasn't more he wasn't god but just in a few moments he rolled back his shoulders and he spoke lazarus come forth showing exactly what he spoke to martha that i am the resurrection and i am the life he cares about your needs and he is the god of all comfort as paul would say even jesus at the death of his cousin at john the baptist hearing about how that he passed away when he heard it the bible tells us that he pulled back and he departed into a ship and jesus being a man wanted to get away from the crowd but there was such a powerful ministry that jesus had that the hungry followed him but the bible didn't say that he rejected those but the bible tells us that he opened up his bounds of compassion but when they left him then jesus had to have his moment because he didn't understood like you and he had grief like you but what did jesus do he climbed up on the mountain to pray his friends and his disciples at that moment got caught in trouble out on the sea and then we find jesus walking on the water you see as i've just depicted to you that in all of christ's grieving some of the greatest miracles took place and in our grieving even here today and in the months to cone look for the hands of almighty god he will once again walk on water he will once again feed your hungry and aching soul and he will never push away the insignificant one it is a story as we prepare to sing this song sister whitney there's a story that is that is told about the the great leonardo da vinci that he started to work on time and his students had watched him as he brought them in and they he was planning out the subject and the perspective of sketching out the outline and applying the colors with his own genius ways then all of a sudden he he spoke and he paused the painting it was unfinished but he turned to his students and he said he said you finished the work and those students looked on that painting so we don't have the ability that you have we don't have the minecraft that you have to finish this work and da vinci said will not what i have already done inspire you to do your best and the one the student picked up and finished the painting and it's one of the greatest paintings it's known how much more is jesus looking at your life and saying can you not be inspired by what i have done take up the pen and do your best god bless you [Music] it's not just about the manger where the baby lays it's not all about the angels who sing for him that day it's not all about the shepherds [Music] it's about cross it's about my sins it's about how jesus came to be born [Music] so that you and i could have it's not just about good things in this life i've done [Music] it's not all about the treasures or the trophies that it's i've about the righteousness that i find within it's all about expressed [Music] is [Music] it's about [Music] so that you and i could [Music] it is it's the ending that can save you and that's why we sell our brains [Music] it's about how jesus came to be [Music] it's about [Music] away [Music] someday so that you and i could have someday [Music] we never think that we're going to come to a time like this in a young life brother doug is a pillar of this church sister donna they were here at the beginnings when all things were started here in the early 70s as a pastor here for quite a while now i've i've known ben since he was a boy watched him grow up enjoyed him in so many ways i i liked i liked it that he was rough i kind of like rough people i liked it that he was complicated you know because life is complicated life is difficult life takes a lot of roads today we are sitting here and many of you know being in a lot of different directions maybe you didn't know ben praying on his knees you knew him as a different man chad you were a great friend you knew him a lot of different directions brother doug was a great friend man the boys that you've just heard speak today or my boys i think one of the greatest things that there is is family and in this crazy generation that we live in never lose focus of your family and how quickly that it goes by brother doug created a place to where that his family could build homes could live close they could have coffee together cake together could enjoy meals together could pop in when we're all having haircuts it was in one of those places to when that ben came in and wanted to talk serious talk not about cars not about different things you want to talk about god it was in one of those spots that i was able to sit in a corner with him and spend some time with him talk to him about eternal things i think every one of us need to sit down at things and think about what is going to happen to me after i die a couple things that i don't know if you're aware of here but the first fellow that spoke today was the guy that would walk to the pulpit and preach ben's last sermon and then as he sat there and he listened and he responded sat with his father he had plans he had plans for the evening he responded to the word matthew didn't know that i'm preaching the last sermon to ben hill probably 250 people was here but it was ben's last service we didn't know that he didn't know that his resting place that evening chad after he had spent the day with you his resting place would be in brother wiggum's yard when his truck rolled over of the of the thousands of places to wreck you reckon a preacher's yard in a preacher's yard where the family could come hot chocolate would be served blankets and coats prayer could be taking place i think our heavenly father is so merciful to us we can't we can't imagine when we think we are in control of life we just can't imagine how much that he's watching over us i think about as i watched the pictures today and that was so well done i don't know who all was arranged in getting the pictures together today but i think that was one of the best that i've ever witnessed brother doug you sitting on a on a little boat and he's on the other end of it you guys are enjoying the day a full wheeler that they'll enjoy those are moments moments that you got to enjoy you got to love military school marriage work chad i don't know if you know this but he really loved working with you man he loved it he told me how much he loved it but every day you got to go home home in the evenings no matter how long you work no matter how difficult the day you go home i think home is a wonderful place i just heard andrew speak about it jesus had a friend it was a kind of a place to where that that jesus felt comfortable going two sisters and a brother the brother was young but that brother got sick and brother he got sick and he continued to get sick and he died and they called for jesus to come now just think about the the place that they had preserved for him as their house i quite honestly wouldn't want any of the presidents to come to my house nor the queen of england but the king of the kings and the lord of lords has been invited to my house and he's welcomed there 24 hours a day he already knows what i do he already knows how i think he knows before that i even speak the words that are going to come out of my mouth and so jesus being a man needs a place to rest at times and it's been that kind of a home but i want to thank god at this moment that he cares enough he never forgets you and on his way back in his sister asked him said if you would have been here my brother wouldn't have died maybe if we would have done something different we wouldn't be sitting here today but god holds our life in his hands and he's the kind of god he's the kind of god that that created the heavens and the earth and holds all the stars in their places and yet he can be so great he can do all of that and yet he can create the smallest molecule in your body and you say well brother ron but i'm young and i've got my life to live the average funeral is 18 years old so let me just say this to you don't count on waiting till you're 90 to give your life to god don't face god as your judge don't face him and and unlike and have be at a spot to where that god has to say i never i never knew you i i don't want to be there to a spot to where god is my judge i want him as my savior i want him as my savior i understand i understand being saved i understand how difficult life can be i'll give you a couple for instance a few years ago i was in a in a scrap yard in near west virginia and i was just i was just there was working with the boys here and there was a roughit guy he was just rough we had a moment he turned around to me and he said preacher i need you to pray for me i looked i looked at him and i said let's pray right now we spent just a bit in prayer the next week there was a flood came through that place floods went across that scrapyard and he didn't have nothing to grab a hold of so he grabbed a barrel and the owner of the scrapyard watched him wash down the river i would be there a couple of weeks later the owner of that yard he he told me he said we were sitting on two five gallon buckets we were just talking rough is not the word and i looked over and tears were running down out of his eyes i said what's going on he said he said you know i never thought jesus would come to a place like this said this is a rough place but jesus was here a few weeks ago i said how did he show up he said well he said i'll watch back through this building i watched you grab a ramen and pray with raymond and he said i was the one that watched him go down the river i'm glad i had a moment with raymond yesterday i sat at a table in blacksburg probably one of the roughest individuals i know sat at the table with me and a bunch of other preachers and i call that man my buddy and he said preacher i want to get saved tonight. i said why don't we do it today this morning he said well i want to do it tonight because i may not remember it next week i'm glad i had that moment with ben that i can look back and point to some points to where that god dealt with his life and ministered to his life brother william it was so well put lighthouses all around him the scripture said that god is a refuge in strength and a very present help in a time of trouble therefore will not we fear though the earth be removed and though count the mountains be carried away in the midst of the sea a psalm that we read since we were a child brother doug the lord is my shepherd and i shall not want he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside of still waters he restoreth my soul and he leadeth me in the past of righteousness for his name's sake and yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no death no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they they comfort me and thou prepares the table before me in the presence of my enemies and they are known as my head with all my comfort over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and i will dwell in the house of the lord forever brother doug i i just want to share a couple personal things with you you set in a service here and it looked like the lord had called you home
