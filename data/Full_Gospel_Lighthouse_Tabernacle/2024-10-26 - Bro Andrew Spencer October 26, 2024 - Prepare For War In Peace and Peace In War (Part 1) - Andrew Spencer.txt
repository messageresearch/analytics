Snider I believe he lives in Rono there so want to be remembering that family there have we have an unspoken request youd like to lift up to the Lord this evening amen I'm going to ask our brother Gabriel Spencer if he would just come lead us to the throne of grace this evening I shared this at Dad's church here a couple weeks ago and um what I had told told them as I'd woke up I'd woke up one morning and was getting ready for work but as I rolled out of bed the scripture Hebrews 12 and one just came out of my mouth and I wasn't really sure even what I was speaking at the time and so I went and I looked at it and I saw that that was that's a scripture we've heard it a lot um let us run and that's what our pastor took and he took that message and when he heard that from Brother Ed bisc he was one of the ones that took that inspiration and said what can I do with that and I believe that if we can all as a people here take that inspiration that our pastor has laid before us because we all are going to touch a life that another one's not we're going to come in contact with people that each and every one of us are not so take that inspiration and let's run let's run and ever since that I uh this the service let us run it it popped up and then right after that um finishers finishers had popped up that brother Danny steeman had spoke in Louisiana and he opened the service up with Hebrews 12:1 and I believe there's a purpose in that and it and it's time it's time to finish it's not those who start it's those who finish and so let's let's take that and let's run like never before because it's not one it's not two and we know and we can just take we can just take what our pastors laid before us time and time again and let's run let's finish the race and I pray every day that if I can come in contact with one person and let them see Christ that's what I want to do no matter what I do let them see Christ let's just take these knees before the Lord gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're just so humbled and just grateful to be able to come and be in be in this service and be able to come and be here in your presence Lord and we could be in so many places and we can be out in the world and all of us have a testimony all of us have a have a walk that you've allowed us to walk through but Lord Jesus you've allowed us to do that to be able to show us your grace Lord Lord you you allow us to get sick and you see the ones that are sick and needy and we see the we see the little baby there in Uva and Lord Jesus I believe that you could just move on that need just right now and you can remove the fluid and they might not know exactly why it's there but allow them to be able to to be able to testify they don't even know how it left because Lord Jesus we know that you're the Healer and you're the you're the great physician Lord and each and every one of these needs we may not understand everything and as brother Donnie spoke last week at that meeting is allow us to be able to take your nose as well as we don't we don't know we don't know your wisdom we don't know what what you may be moving upon and how you may be working but Lord Jesus allow us to be a Christian that can take your NOS just as well as we can take your yeses Lord and Lord I just pray that you could just come and you could just move in this service like never before as you come each and every time and we we could just feel your presence and that's what we ask for once again as we just invite you to come and come and just save one more Soul if it's one it's worth 10,000 worlds and Lord Jesus Jesus I'm believing that all of us should never become stagnant in our walk but allow us to be able to just grow higher and allow us not to become comfortable where we're at but allow us always to be able to ask you for more ask you for more of the Holy Ghost a renewing of the baptism of the Holy Ghost Lord and I just pray that you could just come down tonight and remove anything that is unlike you and allow us to become more Christlike I ask that you would just anoint brother Andrew as you've done once once and time and time again before anoint him tonight use the gift that you've placed inside out of his life and allow him to just speak the word speak the word tonight that it may reach into the depths of our soul that we could just draw closer to you and

to appreciate you all for for the gifts and the gift cards and the the notes and things and somebody knows my innermost secrets and they bought me smiley gift cards and I don't know who you are but God bless you and we love you with the love of the Lord and Andrew Spencer but I we got we received some some really good notes in there um from from each of you but these little kids I tell you what they've touched our heart in so many ways and and uh it's something about something about a child and the words of a child that just they just mean something to you so I I appreciate your children uh loving the Lord and loving this message and I appreciate their words because I realize that I I do never want to I never want to hurt them in any way and and I if I have if I have a kid's respect that's all right I I I really don't care whether I have your respect or not because if I have your kids respect because I know that the kingdom of God is like a little child on Amen and I never want to offend any any child of God but especially a little child they've got such tender faith and they believe they believe what you teach them and what you tell them and and I believe it's very important what you're teaching them here by bringing them here to the house of the Lord week in and week out and we just we just want to turn around and appreciate you for all your hard labors I know sometimes being apparent is not the easiest thing especially in the midst of Le otsa having to deal with all the the circumstances that we we have to but I just want to tell you that I'm proud of you and I appreciate you from the depths of my heart amen amen do you love the Lord with all your heart how many has a need that you like to make known unto the Lord by the way of an uplifted hand amen amen amen God Rich bless you I believe God's going to meet your needs here tonight amen let's just go to the Lord in prayer Heavenly Father what a what a privilege it is for us as your children to be gathered here in the presence of the most high God to recognize that there are angels that have gathered here in this building tonight to worship you and to watch us worship father and to come to a place where we realize that the true word is being spoke and we just ask Lord that we just lay aside every weight and sin that does so easily beset us and let us run the race with patience oh God and I pray that you would just anoint us in our running Lord Jesus that you would anoint us in our in our worship anoint us in our amening of the word and in our living out the scriptures I pray father that you would come amongst us tonight you have dealt with me on these scriptures upon these thoughts for the last three four weeks now and I pray that you would just bring to uh bring to fruition the things that you have on your mind father I pray that you would help the gift father Lord as I get myself out of the way father that's the greatest gift that I have and I pray that you'd help that gift just now father Lord not to give my own mind or my own words Lord but to Simply yield myself over to the power of the Holy Spirit and not only myself but every person here under the sound of our voice Lord I know God that you're going to do something spectacular here father Lord I I've already seen things happening and I ask Lord that you would just begin to watch watch over your seed just now and bring to pass the things that you are doing here in our midst we so appreciate and love you from the depths of our soul and the body of Jesus Christ said amen amen if you have your Bibles this evening wouldd like to look over in the Book of Joel chapter 3 and verse 9 Joel chapter 3 and verse 9 and Romans chapter 8 verse 5 certainly appreciate it Sister Christina and sister Faith's song tonight brother Timothy you got work to do big guy you're next no slack around here no slack and I know he can sing it's all right he won't kill me too bad that's my buddy nobody paid me anything buddy just be ready tomorrow amen you love the Lord with all your heart I come to have a good time tonight amen Joel chapter 3 and verse 9 and I like to speak to you um this this thought that's as I said it's been on my heart for about four weeks now on prepare for war in peace and for peace in war prepare for war in peace and for peace in war Joel chapter 3 and9 Proclaim ye this amongst the Gentiles prepare War wake up the Mighty Men let all the men of War draw near and let them come up beat your plow shares un swords and your pruning hooks into Spears and let the weak say I am strong Romans chapter 8 and verse 5 very familiar scripture reading to us as Christians and if you're a if you're a fresh Christian I would memorize Romans chapter 8 Romans 8 chapter 8 and verse 5 for they that are after The Flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace because the carnal mind is enmity against God for it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God but you are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of God dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of of his may God bless his word you may be seated here tonight in the presence of the Lord amen as we said we'd like to speak to you on on prepare for war in peace and for peace in war and that word prepared it means it means to make ready beforehand for some purpose to use or or activity to make ready for the activity to make ready for the use of it it's like you sisters that are preparing meals for your family you you have thought you have plans laid out you have things that are you have things that are prepared it to prepare it means to put in a proper state of mind it's you've come here tonight with a preparation to put yourself in a place where you are prepared to listen to the preaching of the word it means to work out the details it means to plan in advance it means to prepare a strategy and brother Brandon would teach us that God's strategy is to take empty vessels an empty take empty vessels and pour empty them out and pour himself in there that's God's strategy and I believe that if you're going to do anything you ought to do it well whether it's in natural or whether it's in a spiritual realm that you ought to do all things well and that you ought to prepare there's got to be preparations for it if you've got to whatever it might be in life you've got to make preparations or the outcome that you're looking for is going to be mediocre it's not going to be what you anticipate or or the success that you have in your mind if you don't prepare for it in such and such way then things are going to fall on the ground and not and not the outcome is not going to be as you desired and the prophet took a took a thought in 1953 and he preached on this message on Preparation he said now God before he does anything he always prepares for it he said before he said before we ever go over and fight a war we've got to prepare for that war and he said if you're ever going to get married why you prepare for that time and if you have preparations and before you come to church you made preparations the ambulance brought you here or your loved one brought you here you had to get a certain amount of money ready before you could come it's preparation and God is always prepares the people for the events that's just about to happen and I believe that we are in great one of the greatest times where we recognize that we we as a people of God are preparing not just to not just to live Christian lives not just to be better people but I believe that we are making preparations for for a for a translation one of these mornings between in the seventh hour between the hours of 6 and n as the prophet would say it in the in the message of the Rapture but we realize that that that this message has come that what we have received has prepared our hearts to turn us back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers but it was this message that did all of that it prepared our hearts so that that we could have the faith to operate the word of God as God said it in his word and I believe that that as the people of God as we are believers of the word of God we have made preparations to get oursel in line by the word of God and I I want to maybe just make this little declaration that somebody here tonight is making room for Their Blessings they're they're they're making ready for it because they have come under anticipation or expectation however you want to say it but they have prepared for something to receive from the word of God that's why there is such a gift in the in the ministry that they gets out of the way and they they study to show them themselves approved and they they get thems they're preparing to bring for the word but there is something on the other side of it like a deep calling to the Deep where somebody is preparing whatever God has for them no matter what it is no matter what form it comes in whether it's in song or whether it's in testimony or whether it's by the preaching of the word they make it ready for it just like Elizabeth when she was there with her husband Zacharias and she'd been 6 months along in her pregnancy and she hadn't felt no move on the inside of her in the inside of her womb because little John hadn't come to life yet but she all that time she was expecting that that if God could do the miraculous in her old age that surely she was going to make preparations so she was sitting there and she was making her house ready she was she was she was knitting getting things together why because because maybe she was in a spot where where she was in a in a terrible condition by looking at the natural circumstances but even in the worst of circumstances when it didn't look like there was no life there Elizabeth still prepared because she recognized there was power that was behind this this wasn't just some phenomena that happened but there was prophecy that I was allowing her to make herself ready to get into a POS position that the miraculous could come into her body and she could produce the miraculous I think it's sometimes when you are in your worst conditions and when you are in a spot where you don't fully understand the phenomenas that are happening that it's in those times that the supernatural truly takes place the prophet said it like this he said that's the way to do he said you got to make ready for it tonight he said I love this he said make ready for it tonight he said get your blanket off your B off your body get your foot on the floor get ready to come out of that wheelchair come off the bed and make ready for it what are you saying brother Andrew I'm saying this get your foot on the floor come on somebody take your take the blankets off your body put your foot on the floor get up out of your condition make ready for it because God who makes a promise he keeps a promise if you'll water with praises of thank you Lord positive that you know what you're doing for your standing on his promises woo where you got your foot tonight brother Andrew I got my foot on the promise I got my foot out there and it don't it don't look like I should have my foot out there it may not look like I need to have my foot out there but I got my foot out there maybe your boss has been upset with you this week and you're ready for a change get your foot on the floor maybe you've had some had some bubblings this week or some babblings this week with your wife and you're ready for those things to be over put your foot on the floor maybe your business isn't prospering the way that you want it but get your foot on the floor make ready for it now in 1790 during during his first annual address to Joint session there in Congress George Washington would stand there and he he would State this he said now to be prepared for war is one of the most effectual means of preserving peace to be prepared for war is the most effectual means of preserving Peace So if you if you want to have peace in your life you got to have some war in your life I brother Andre goes against my Christian background let me say this you you cannot be a Christian without going to war you cannot be a 21st century so-called Christian where you believe that love is everything love thy neighbor as thyself and we have a loving God love all the all the all the all the people that have their titles of what they want to be identified as you cannot identify as that kind of a Christian and be an overcomer of Le osia are you with me but if you're going to be a Christian and do you want to be a Christian I'm not just talking about a church goer I'm not just talking about that somebody that takes up a Pew but I'm talking about a Christian a Christian to be Christlike then there's got to be some times in your life when you go to war war with yourself war with your mind war with Satan war with demons and war with all of yourself the prophet said in putting on the whole armor of God he said I believe it was Lincoln that said one time in peace prepare for war he said it may not have been he said but it sounds like seems to me rather it was it was he that made the statement in time of peace prepare for war and that would be a good thing for us to think about in the time while everything's running smooth you better get ready for Satan is going to he he said he he's he isn't going to let it run smooth very long you're in a convention now and everything just pouring along just fine but you're going to leave here in a few days and you're going to meet the enemy he said he might not even wait for you to get ready to leave he just might attack you at any time so he's wicked and ruthless he he just carries on whenever he can whatever he can say or he does it like that he said he said so it's best to be dressed all the time you might meet him on the Street out there you might meet him in your car it's hard telling where you're going to meet at him where you're going to meet him at and I think that if it that all of us could say that we would enjoy a time of peace I think we could all say that that we would enjoy a time of Peace where we're not constantly battling with Satan and and constantly battling with our mind and constantly battling with the the wars of attrition and the and the things that Satan constantly battling with us and constantly having to put up with Satan and his assments against the Church of the Living God but if you're ever going to get in peace you've got to fight for peace you got to fight for peace I believe that you can have perfect peace because the Bible said in Isaiah chapter 26 that I will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on me so I believe that you can live there it's just how bad do you want to live in peace now you watch people that are constantly bickering and fighting in their marriage they just truly don't want peace there are Hallelujah I'm preaching there are certain people that are not that are not enjoying love unless they got to make up for something ah let me leave that alone just for a minute because there's a lot of things I know that could go right there but there are some people that are never happy without a fight they're constantly wanting to jab at somebody with their lips with their mouth with their with their actions but I'm not that kind of Christian I'm me I'm not going to back up from a fight I'm not I'm not going to back down but I tell you what life's too good to be fighting all the [Applause] time Life's Too Sweet Life's too short why we constantly got to be fighting against this one and fussing about politics and fussing about what's going on in the world let's live in peace if anybody can live in peace the body of Jesus Christ ought to be able to live in peace Hallelujah brother maram would say it like this when he would talk about Eisenhower Eisenhower he brother brandham had great admiration for eisenh how he said when we were fighting Eisen said he said he said there's many times we picked up a shell and throw it in the gun and pulled the hammer on it and let it fall and it snapped and it didn't go off he said we didn't surrender he said we might have put another one in and it snapped too he said we didn't give up we just kept on snapping till the one went off he said that's the way to win the war is keep trying throw a shell in it put it in it you got a purpose and a Target to hit well if that's scripture didn't work get another one come on somebody come on somebody if this one didn't work today pick up another one don't give up on God don't give up on one scripture don't give up when you prayed and it didn't come to pass put another one in your mouth put it on your lips speak it out of your mouth believe it accept it profess it and live that way and the sudden secret going away of the church I was reading an article some time ago on a sudden attack on Pearl Harbor he said there wasn't no exactly unknown attack he said they'd already been warned that the Japs were going to do that he said but the sad part was they ignored the warning they had signs in the Japanese Army assembling themselves together and a big ship's being loaded with ammunition and the threat was in the air and they were just exactly in line for the invasion but they ignored it he said that's the way it is today with the church the church is in line of judgment but they're ignoring the coming of the Lord you know it's coming the world knows it's coming the world can feel the pressure of it let me I don't know how much longer we're going to be here but give us four and a half more years here on Earth and you'll have somebody else to war with about going who's in office so don't get so tore up about their policies that's not my War well preach about Trump preach about Harris that's not my War but I'll tell you what my war is it's about getting your children saved about seeing you miss the tribulation it's about seeing you living overcoming life and having the power to defeat every Power in hell that's my War so that's a worthy fight so that's what I'll fight [Applause] for I ain't got enough time to talk about all the things that are going on in the school world where we got kids that are having deal with all the pressures with all the pressures of of homosexuality and sodomy and everything else I don't have enough time to spend with every little child and talk to them about the wars that they are in in their own human flesh but I do have a word and this word will work for you whether it's in this situation as a little bitty old child or as an adult as a son and daughter of God no weapon that is formed against you shall prosper the gates of hell cannot Prevail so what are you saying brother Andrew I'm saying if you're going to leave this world you've got to make preparations just like Noah did because God told him it was going to rain and he believed it so he made preparations for it and he started building an ark there was a lot of people that didn't understand the preparations but he kept on working there was a lot of people that don't understand why you believe this message like you do but God promised it and you're making preparations for it because if God said that tonight that Gabriel is going to find peace in his family then God has got he's got a reason to say those things he's got a reason to speak to those things he's got a reason just like if you had healing if you needed healing in your body and God already made a way for that all you got to do is get yourself in line get in line for it get in line for restoration get in line for your Miracle get in line for your healing because the Bible said in in 1 Corinthians 14:8 that if the trumpet give an uncertain sound who shall prepare himself to battle the things that you have heard there is nothing uncertain about this message there's nothing nothing uncertain about William bram's message there's nothing uncertain about this word so if you know what you have heard is nothing but thus sayith the Lord you can stake your soul on it you can raise your children on it you can defeat Satan with it because you are going to fight for your peace let me talk to you daddies it's time to fight like a man it's time to be a man and Fight Like a Man it's time that you take back everything that the devil stole out of your family if he's put TV in your life if he's put not pornography in your life if he's put demonic powers in your life if he's robbed you of your prayer life as the head of your home be a man and take it back if you want real peace you got to fight dirty sometimes if you want real peace he came in there and slipped under the garden walls in the most intricate place that there ever was the most guarded Place surely if he can get into the Garden of Eden he can get in your mind and if he can get in your mind he'll get in your soul if he's if he's able but praise be to God you cannot be deceived because it ain't possible to deceive the elect of God so if he has slipped into your home if he has slipped into your prayer life if he has slipped into your marriage take it back come on he ain't going to leave you here without a fight he's going to fight you day in and day out as a son and daughter of God but you be a man like Paul said quit you like men quit you like men Stand Fast in the faith and be strong h brother Gabriel has has been a a subnormal in his field of work where men can't understand how a young boy could rise to this potential that he is in and they have invested they have invested thousands of dollars in that human vessel they have spent time in studies and and intellectual things because they see something that it can produce what they're looking for now they didn't send him to those schools just to so that he could say he went there and as a prophet would say that we didn't come here to eat cookies but they s him there for training for such a reason because there are things that have got to be figured out and when a computer can't figured out you cannot defeat the power of a human mind because there are certain instincts that God places in human beings it's amazing when somebody is born to be a peacemaker God deposited something on the inside of him it's like you can't explain why Matthew always shows up at the right time whether to save you whether you're choking or whether you're in a fire or I won't tell you everything that he's kept us from but it literally amazes us as a family how many times when when we're in the midst of a crisis of somebody some somebody needing CPR while you're eating ice cream gar Matthew steps right in he will was born with something on the inside of him that Mom and Dad didn't put there it's like all these all of these things that brother Gabriel's had to go through he's went through them for a reason because there's something on the other side of the training that'll make him more sufficient that'll make him a more qualified I'm dancing around it so you know what I'm saying but it's time whether you are in your position whether you're a janitor whether you're a cak maker whether you're a bomb Builder whether you're a teacher I don't care what you are God put something on the inside of you that he deposited that the world can't take away from you well you say well that scripture is just for men be you quit like no absolutely not when a play when in a place where there is no men you women stand out as Real Women of Grace So Paul was saying study to be a man be a man don't be a child don't be carried away with every wind of Doctrine that's what he's saying he's not saying be a we'd all look we'd all love to look like brother Josh especially me I can work out I can run I can I can do everything possible my wife can put me on a regimen to C all of these vitamins that don't make no sense to me and I still come out looking like a flabby little redheaded he Paul ain't talking about being a man he's talking about be a man be a man of wisdom be a man of scripture be a man of understanding don't be carried away with every wind of Doctrine don't get caught up in here and there be a man of the scripture believe the scripture a prophet said I can take a man out there he said that never heard of God worshiping an idol and do more with him in five minutes and you can do with a fellow that that professes to be a Christian he's an old mossback something that's hung along had a lot of inbombing fluid jerked into his veins he said puts me in mind of some of these old cold morgs down here somewhere like an Undertaker establishment he said settle down in there I go in there he said them old big old churches he said it puts me in mind of a morg he said their spiritual thermometers goes 100 below zero he said they put some fluid in there and they take a taking a dead man to a mark and they take all the blood out of him and put something in there to make sure that he's dead if you want to know what denominations do that's what they're doing they're pulling the blood of Jesus Christ out and they're trying to pump something in you to keep you dead don't let Satan take the blood out of you you need this Blood you need this power don't just be a man be a God man a man of Faith a man of understanding a man of wisdom a man of the script scriptures the Book of James said it in 3:17 but the wisdom that is from above is first pure then Peaceable gentle easy to be intreated full of Mercy good fruits without partiality without hypocrisy and the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace I like fting too much yeah it's okay David was a man of war he is known for some of the greatest Feats throughout his his kingdom Reign and even throughout his his young adulthood he is known as having some of the Greatest Warrior moments in the Bible but in being a man of war David strove for peace his entire life because what's the what's the on the other side of War what's what's the go goal like literally what's the goal of fighting you want peace on the other side of it now to be honest we were in war for 4,000 years because Humanity can never get above the altar Humanity can never get above the Lamb of a sacrificial lamb that would die year in and die year out but we were in war but when Christ Christ came was the first time that Humanity lived in peace since the Garden of Eden if we can't live in peace and accepting him as our savior then his his accomplishments were in vain you don't have to war with your sin you don't have to war with your past you don't have to war with who you were you don't have to war with your generations of 40 generations of of this that and the other you can live in peace that quick I was talking to Brother David last week and he said something to me that astounded me don't be surprised Christina he says some astounding things he said but immediately I love this sounds his word sounded exactly like the Book of Mark Mark Mark uses the word immediately over and over and over again he said but as soon as the Lord came in life immediately he said there was peace he said I didn't fight with it no more I didn't fight with addictions I didn't I didn't fight with that that's the power of a birth when a when a when a woman is with child and she's got groanings on the inside of her that baby is at peace right here he doesn't know the world but he's going through War to get into that world but when he gets into that world he never wants to go back to that world again let me say this to you when I was born again I was one way one day but from that timeall I didn't have to war with my flesh I didn't war with my mind I didn't war with my mistakes I was at peace but before that you w with it you w with your flesh you w with your mind you wed with your spirit it was a battle but when the peace that passes all understand it comes to your life there is nothing like the Peace of almighty God because Jesus said in me you will have peace but in the world you're going to have tribulation but be of good cheer I have overcome the world Hallelujah you say I want peace in my life peace in my home peace in my marriage peace in my mind find Jesus David I'm not going to read all of it because I got some ground to cover tonight y'all happy to be in church because because David was was was striving for peace and you start reading over in 2 Samuel chapter 10 after nahas the king of the ammonites had died and and that that that King nahas had showed kindness unto David and David when he heard about nahash n you go to read all the chapter when he heard about nahash D David went there and he wanted to comfort his son Hanan he went there and he went to comfort him and show him kindness but the men that were surrounding hanun they begin to speak to him said do you really think that David the Philistine killer is really coming up here to bring peace and and to comfort you what he's doing here is to bring he's bringing spies with him he's not really coming here to comfort you and bring peace to you he's coming here to see how many armies that we got on the inside of these walls he's he's coming here to seek everything out he's he's looking but you see how amazing that the how the ammonites had misread the entire situation because David was really going there from his heart he was going there to to show them Comfort because David had had comfort in his life because when you study the life of David David's life is not always killing Giants David's life's most of his life was spent in the cave here the ammonites they they completely they had no discernment on this situation and and that and when when when Hanan sees all them he comes in there and he humiliates the children of Israel he humiliates all the Hebrews and he he cuts off their garments and shaves off all their beards and to do that to an Israelite it's a disgraceful thing because because when when when you shave off a Hebrew shave his beard off you are disgracing him because slaves because slaves walk around with clean shaven faces brother TJ and brother Matthew we recognize they're not slaves so Katie No Shave November but it really it was a disgraceful thing and when King David heard this when King David heard this he he he put them aside these Men of War he put them aside for a season until their beards grown because they literally cut their garments off to their buttocks and they shaved their face and it was such an shameful event that happened in the Hebrews life that they did not want to appear in public amen because everyone would think that they're now A Slave I got scriptures for the other side of things too but I want I'm not going there tonight but David went there for one purpose and I'll tell you what it is when when a man goes there when a man goes there for peace and you spit on him and right in the face he immediately turns from man of peace to a man of war he literally turn and when David heard these things when he heard these things he got so stirred up brother Ron he got so stirred up that he called on the Mighty Men and the and the ammonites they they recognize they wasn't able to really defeat David and all of his mighty men so they hired out some mercenaries by the name of the Syrian ites and they brought them in there and they had 33,000 men that was going to come in there and they was going to destroy David but David called on the Mighty Men and I love what the Bible when you study out what Mighty Men means it means the worthy ones you may or not think that you're worthy and you may not think that you're mighty but you don't have to call yourself that David called you that these men were elected to stand right there to be right there these were the choice men you might be a little bit intimidated by Satan and all of his power and all of his Bluffs because he's constantly breathing out lies and and constantly breathing out threatening against the Church of the Living God and and and joab which was the captain over top of the Mighty Men he was standing there and he could see there's 33,000 Syrian ites that are that are coming over here and he looked out across his army and to me what joab does he gives one of the greatest Marshall Marshal speeches that's ever been known and men have stood there and they've they've critiqued this statement they have looked over it and said what did joab do that he could bring peace to his Warriors in the midst of a battle when they were outnumbered he said be of good cheer second Samuel 10:12 be of good courage what else do you need I got a question what else do you need come on somebody what else do you need be of good courage and let us play the men for our people and for the cities of our joab that's all he said you can read the rest of the chapter that's all he said be of good courage and play the part of a man that was all that they needed he didn't stand there and PR them and teach them you're this you're that he just simply said be of good courage be a man for our people and for the cities of God he said not like the Syrian ites that have been paid to come in here and plunder you he said but you do this for king and country you do this for your family you do this for your god well nobody else said nobody else sees what I'm doing you do it for God you do it for this brother you do it for that sister I'll tell you what I feel religious you might be intimidated but be of good courage play the part of a man come on I know you got it on the inside of you I know you got power on the inside of you I know you got faith on the inside of you you be a man well I tell you what I don't know what to do with Satan and all of his power let me say this be of good courage be of good courage I could stand here the rest of the night and I hope you get it be of good courage well Satan attacked my family be of good courage you knew he was going to attack you so prepare for peace and War you know he's going to attack you well you think well everything's going okay right now and I ain't really been going through no trials get ready baby let me give you a news flash you might have just gone through a little bit of season so that you could get your breath back up on on the inside of you you might have been joining the mountain top for a season but get ready baby that baby comes off as te pill I'm brother bandom said you can't stay on top of mountains cuzz your FRS your fruits will freeze up there you can't stay up there all that time you got to come down off of it you got to come off your high horse sometimes you got to recognize that God put something on the inside of you right and you had this all your life there's something constantly drawing you it didn't bother other people but it bothered you but something was drawn to you something kept pulling on you something kept preparing you for the season that you're in something something kept you can't explain it you didn't want to do what other people did you didn't want to say words like the other kid said you don't want to listen to that kind of music because something was on the inside of you it's like old like that old Chief it said when he gave his heart to the Lord you remember I gave my heart to the Lord and he said they come and ask him said Chief what's the matter he said he said bad war on inside me said what's going on chief he said 'ever since me' been saved he said constant War constant war on the inside he said there's two dogs on the inside of me he said well which dog's winning he said the one that Chief feeds most he's a white dog and there's a black dog on the inside of me and he said it depends which one I feed the most which one wins I know you may not believe this but I I was putting his sermon together about four weeks ago and we us boys we got out and we just got done finishing up some work and spirit of the Lord they probably didn't know what was going on but Spirit of the Lord was just dealing with me and we get out we get out of our truck and getting ready to go grab a bite to eat and God just drops that little nugget in my heart on the war within us all of a sudden around the corner of that restaurant comes a white dog I said I'll feed that one I'm not giving over to thing I'm not giving over to speculation I'm not giving over to a illusions of those things but it literally is which one you going to feed do you want to have peace in your marriage do you want to have peace on your job do you want to have peace in your family do you want to have peace in your spiritual life do you want it and say it's is simple yes or no question do you want to live in peace then feed the white dog if you know that dog leads you into temptation don't feed the dog come on somebody if that getting on the Internet leads you to bad places don't feed the [Applause] dog come on somebody if walking by a bar joint and you hear music and you tap your foot all day long don't feed the dog I'm going tell you what human rights might hear this and they might get all over me but I'm telling you don't feed the black dog and I got a black dog at home don't feed the black dog on the inside of you that constantly is Waring with your mind Waring with your soul Waring with your spirit don't feed the dog don't give him Kibbles and bits don't give him just a little Spoonful here and there don't feed the dog starve the dog kill oh my kill the dog you might have to clip that one brother Jeremy but any message believer knows what I'm talking about it literally Paul said it's a war in my members when I would do good evil is present you mean me hey Bor again son and daughter of God let me tell you this as long as we are in this world you are going to be a slave to this flesh and this flesh C craves pleasure this flesh craves entertainment but the Holy Spirit on the inside of you thwarts that pleasure and thwarts those desires the holy spirit says that's enough give back to praying give back to reading give back to worshiping [Applause] god brother brandom said in the message preparations he he talks about the white dog and black dog and he goes on he said the thing that's in your heart now telling you that that God's true that the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the way and God's preparation today is the Holy Spirit The Blood Washed Church regenerated filled with the Holy Ghost signs and wonders is Vindicated proving that he's with it that the thing that he's telling you feed that a few minutes and you'll be numbered with them feed that a few minutes just a few minutes feed these things that you've heard that God still does Miracles feed that amen feed that God still gives the Holy Ghost feed that feed that God forgives you of all your sins feed that feed that he he robs you he robs you of your scars he he robs you of your of your past feed that oh yeah feed that his blood is still powerful enough feed that that I'm going in a Rapture feed that don't constantly be negative I'm I'm not good enough I'm not qualified wake up with a positive mindset put your foot on the ground get up out of your wheelchair and feed the Holy Spirit yes brother Andrew you don't know about my scars you don't know about my complexes you don't know about my fears you don't know about my Wars you don't know what I'm going through I want you to glory in your scars for Christ I'm not giving you psychology but I I want you to glory in your scars and your wounds that you took for Christ every one of us are scarred up I got a scar right here on my hand it means nothing else to nobody else but to me it means something I stuck my hand through a a glass windshield one time being something real stupid doing something real stupid St see it today and every time I look at it memories flow back of what I did and it's so easy to get scarred by other Christians it's so easy to get scarred in your memory and your affections and in those channels and you constantly look at that Scar and I remember what they did and I remember how they said that and blessed are they that are persecuted for my sake instead of constantly Waring Waring with your complexes and your scars rather glory in these things how many times was Christ beat how many times did in his flesh he feel like giving up the battle but in the middle of his War he was thinking about your peace God did not give us the spirit of fear but he gave us the spirit of power of love and a sound mind you say well what are you saying glory in your scars I'm saying this that your conflict can lead you to a deeper growth on what peace truly is and that when you've got peace that peace equips you to engage in the battle more thoughtfully because if you have ever been in a war and you know what it's like to be in peace you can have peace in the middle of your War let me tell you it is a dangerous thing to deal with somebody that doesn't get hot hited in the middle of a war Homer Frasier was one bad fighter because he had a memory the size of an elephant and you never could get him mad but he could stand you could get him mad but in the midst of it when it seems like you would get hotheaded he was more collected pulled him out underneath of a tractor when it ran and he was a most collected guy pull my pistol off my side I don't want to take it to the hospital with me make sure I got my bear aspirin I got all these different things got my he was collected in the fight I tell you what it's a dangerous thing it's a dangerous thing when somebody's got perfect peace in the middle of a war when it seems like all hell's going now I tell you what I tell you what really bombards Satan is is Satan has through everything at Ron Spencer and he's constantly at peace with it I don't care whether I die tomorrow or not I'll be more alive there than I am here how that must upset Satan when he's at perfect peace whether I die or whether I go what do you do with a man that don't have give up on the inside of him but he's at peace with it brother Brandon would teach us over and over again that the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise of God will bring it to pass and whether you believe it or not keep saying it until you believe it I am healed I am delivered I am set free keep speaking until you believe it and when you believe it and accept it it's over it's over so speak the word of God put it on your mouth brother Brandon would say that a the doctor would talk to him and would tell him that if a man if a person is diagnosed with cancer and the doctor said if the person has the right mental attitude towards it he said it retards that case allog together what can you do to a Christian that lives in peace though you slay me I'm going to trust God though you rob me you take my family you take my children come on woman you speak like a foolish woman yet God slay me what are you going to do with a Christian like job in the midst of his War he was in peace I can tell I'm not going to finish this take a deep breath some of you grab your purse and get your jacket on resurrection power is coming somebody wake up your neighbor back there let me find a let me find a good F finishing spot well we'll go right here we just we'll just read these few scriptures the Bible said in Hebrews 12: 14 follow peace with all men and Holiness without and follow peace with all men and holiness without which no man shall see the Lord when you study that word follow in the Greek it means the Greek word is deo which means to persecute it means to follow after it means to run swiftly it means to make to run or to flee to put to flight to drive away so Paul is saying strive for peace with all men and Holiness without which no man shall see the Lord this the same word is is seen in Matthew 5:11 blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake acts 9 and4 it says and he fell to the Earth and he heard a voice saying unto him Saul Saul why persecutest why strive thou with me why are you striving with me Romans 14: 19 let us therefore strive after the things which make for peace and the things wherewith one may edify another Philippians 3 and14 I press I strive towards the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus and he says three scriptures before in verse 11 if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the de if by any means if by no matter what I got to go through if by any means I strive for this I'm running for this no matter what I got to go through I'm going to press I'm going to battle for the High Calling of God and in Romans 12:8 and if it be possible as much as Li in you live peaceably with all men live peaceably with the ones you like live peaceably with all men I love the Prophet The Prophet taught us sometimes it's not possible to live peacefully with all men sometimes it ain't you turned the cheek one time you turn it back again and you found out it ain't Peaceable come on that's right David had went through so many and I'm going I'm going to go here next weekend but I'm I'm going to give you a preliminary David had went through so many things he sought the favor of the king when the king didn't even want him David could have had his kingdom way before Saul ever died but because he respected the anointed of the Lord he chose to live in despair in the backside of a cave and to live peaceably with King Saul rather than to dwell in the king's Palace so your suffering is not in vain the trials that you've been through are worth gold Sister Christina what you have been through to get to this spot the wars the wars the battles It's Time For Peace yes Lord It's Time for peace and now now I don't want to just speak that to her but I want to speak that to Gabriel because I was in my study and I kept seeing you today I kept seeing you and and I so I want to just speak this I just want to say this let's have some peace let's have some War let I know we're in the middle of a war I know Israel's in the middle of a war I know that they're fighting with Iran and they they are constantly bombarding Iran and they're sending out Jets and they're sending out Wars and they're sending out bombs why is Israel doing that because they want peace in their Homeland because they believe that's theirs and I believe that you believe that your family is everything to you that here in this world that you ought to be able to live to a place that you can have your inheritance that you can have your right mind that you can have good health come on you see other people live good lives how about you I'm not just talking about Prosperity I'm talking about nice homes but I'm talking about peace I'm talking about being able to say it Is Well with My Soul when hosio spafford when he was standing out there when he watched his mother watched the mother of his children had had died out there in the middle of the ship in the middle of the ocean he stood out there and said I want to know where they died at and when he stood right there in the middle of his War he pinned these words hallelujah hallelujah let the Billows roll let them roll over me but let me have my peace because I can say it Is Well with My Soul what if you get diagnosed with this what if your family leaves you what if you're the only one left in your F there are people sitting all around this message that are the only ones in their family that believe this message but they wouldn't trade the world's love for the peace that they have let me tell you something you heard me tell this before but I was offered I was offered multi-million dollar money to go out and do the same thing that I do on a everyday basis I was offered it to just go do it for another company more money than I would ever make in my lifetime I couldn't make in five years maybe less than that but I kept riding back up that road and I could not find no peace I could find no peace in that money I could find no peace in flying on the private jet from here and there I could find no peace in it but where I found peace at is
