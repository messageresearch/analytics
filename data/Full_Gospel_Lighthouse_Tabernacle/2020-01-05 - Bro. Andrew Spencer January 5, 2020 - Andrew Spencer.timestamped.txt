[1:50] hey man it's good to be in the house of
[1:52] the Lord this evening
[1:53] hey man if you have your Bibles this
[1:55] evening we'll will turn over to the book
[1:57] of Matthew chapter 1 and verse 23 mm-hmm
[2:01] and then John chapter 1 and verse 14
[2:05] same portion of Scripture that we read
[2:08] from last night man
[2:28] let's speak to the author of the word
[2:30] this this evening father we come to you
[2:34] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[2:37] father we humble ourselves before your
[2:39] great August presence Lord just now and
[2:43] Lord we just want to Lord we want you to
[2:46] hear our voice crying for the blood
[2:48] father Lord we pray that you would
[2:51] shelter us under your wings father and
[2:54] we pray that that the God of all healing
[2:57] the God of all comfort would come and
[2:59] touch our lives just now father you're
[3:02] the Prince of Peace and or do we know
[3:04] that truly this world would not receive
[3:06] peace until the Prince of Peace comes
[3:08] and though we're just thankful to have
[3:10] that peace in our hearts this evening
[3:13] everything could be discombobulated
[3:16] around us but to realize that the God of
[3:19] all heaviness is right here amongst us
[3:21] this evening and Lord what a sacred hour
[3:24] that we're living in and so father we
[3:27] want to be so diligent father Lord to
[3:29] seek your face that while you may be
[3:31] found and Lord we want to call upon you
[3:33] father and ask God to you a touch our
[3:36] lives or to see every person that is
[3:38] here every household that is represented
[3:40] we pray your blessings be upon your
[3:42] children tonight or we've gathered to
[3:44] hear from you not from a man and so we
[3:47] ask that you'd speak from heaven today
[3:49] minister to our lives Lord and we'll be
[3:52] careful to serve you in the name of
[3:53] Jesus Christ amen amen Matthew chapter 1
[3:57] and verse 23 the Bible says behold a
[4:00] virgin shall be with child that's a
[4:03] pretty astounding statement right there
[4:06] behold a virgin shall be with child and
[4:09] shall bring forth a son and they shall
[4:12] call his name Emmanuel which being
[4:14] interpreted is God with us John chapter
[4:19] 1 and verse 14 as you're turning there
[4:22] just to think about that that a mortal
[4:25] man just like you and I made out of the
[4:28] sixteen elements just like you and I
[4:30] would speak those words eight hundred
[4:32] years before the virgin mary was on
[4:35] earth I say that there were there were
[4:38] questions
[4:39] that were involved with his ministry I'm
[4:41] sure that there were things that that
[4:44] went around and also we understand that
[4:46] there were there were people that
[4:48] believed that that here Isaiah's
[4:50] prophecy maybe maybe this maybe every
[4:54] person around was thinking maybe this is
[4:56] me maybe this is my daughter maybe this
[4:58] is my wife
[4:58] maybe this they were looking for it and
[5:01] I believe that as children of God we're
[5:03] looking for things to come to pass in
[5:05] this hour and I believe that we're here
[5:07] I believe this is the I believe this is
[5:10] the the last people we know this is last
[5:13] search age but I believe that the young
[5:15] people that are here and every person
[5:17] here is a people that is getting ready
[5:19] to witness the greatest event that has
[5:21] ever took place on the face of the earth
[5:23] we're a people that are getting ready to
[5:26] take a body change John chapter 1 and
[5:30] verse 14 and I don't want you as I read
[5:35] this I don't want you to just think of
[5:38] Jesus but I want you to think of Jesus
[5:41] right now I want you to see yourself in
[5:44] this scripture I'm asking you to do
[5:47] something that is beyond what science
[5:49] has said I'm asking you to do something
[5:51] that is beyond even what the church
[5:53] realm sells says I'm asking you to read
[5:56] this scripture as if God is speaking of
[5:59] a people right now speaking of you and
[6:02] the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[6:05] amongst us and we beheld his glory the
[6:10] glory as of the only begotten of the
[6:12] Father full of grace and of truth a man
[6:15] may God bless his word he may be seated
[6:18] hey man I don't believe that's too
[6:20] far-fetched but I believe that we are
[6:23] the people of this word and the Pergamon
[6:27] church age if the brothers could put
[6:30] that up before us the members of the
[6:33] virgin bride will love him oh yeah we
[6:38] only thank you and thank you the verb
[6:40] the members of the virgin bride will
[6:43] love him do you love him tonight and
[6:45] they will have his potentials for he is
[6:50] their head say he's our head
[6:53] and all power belongs to him they are
[6:56] subject to him as the members of our
[6:59] bodies are subject to our heads notice
[7:03] the harmony of the father and the son
[7:05] Jesus never did anything until it was
[7:08] first showed him by the father in John
[7:11] 5:19 you see that this harmony is now to
[7:14] exist between the groom and his bride
[7:17] and what a beautiful harmony that is he
[7:20] shows her his word of life she receives
[7:22] it she never doubts it
[7:24] she never doubts it she never doubts it
[7:27] she never doubts it therefore nothing
[7:30] can harm her not even death for if the
[7:33] seed be planet the water will raise it
[7:35] up again here is the secret of this the
[7:38] word is in the bride as it was in Mary
[7:41] the bride has the mind of Christ for she
[7:45] knows what he wants done with the word
[7:47] she performs the command of the word in
[7:50] his name for she has thus saith the Lord
[7:52] then the word is quickened by the Spirit
[7:56] and it comes to pass
[7:57] like a seed that is planted in the water
[7:59] it comes to full harvest serving its
[8:02] purpose
[8:03] those in the bride do only his will not
[8:09] their will not the people's will but his
[8:12] will no one can make them do otherwise
[8:15] they have thus saith the Lord or they
[8:17] keep still they know that it has to be
[8:20] God in them doing the works fulfilling
[8:22] his own word he did not complete all of
[8:25] his work while here while in his earthly
[8:29] ministry so now he works in and through
[8:32] the broad his church is himself revealed
[8:37] and it is and it is expressed by the
[8:41] word itself it is God and you see that
[8:43] the church is God it is God revealed it
[8:47] is his word that has been expressed in
[8:50] this hour I believe that's why we read
[8:52] those scriptures and we put our name
[8:54] there that because I believe that we are
[8:56] seeing ourselves in the Bible you
[8:59] see if all you see is David and if all
[9:01] you see is Joe then and Noah and if you
[9:03] do not find yourself there what in what
[9:06] are we doing in this hour we're not just
[9:08] talking about a God of history we're
[9:10] talking about a god right now I thought
[9:13] that is taking on human flesh just like
[9:16] he did 2,000 years ago in the form of
[9:19] his son when he came here and we are
[9:21] watching that God the Great God Elohim
[9:24] become flesh again in this hour and the
[9:28] things that we have witnessed even in
[9:30] our own community or in our own local
[9:32] church here that if the things that we
[9:34] have watched before our eyes the
[9:36] transformations of of souls and the
[9:39] watch their how the dead have been
[9:41] raised amongst us we realize that this
[9:43] is him these are the things that he
[9:46] promised the reason why we believe these
[9:48] sayings and we see these things is
[9:50] because his Bible has told us his Living
[9:53] Word has told us that these things were
[9:55] going to come to pass and that's exactly
[9:57] what is happening right in this hour we
[10:00] are living in the hours of the
[10:02] manifestations of the sons of God and
[10:04] this is a people and a bride who
[10:07] understands their position you see
[10:10] sister Katie can work and operate in my
[10:12] home as my wife because she is exactly
[10:15] that and you as the wife has the Queen
[10:18] of Heaven have the ability to operate in
[10:21] a realm that no other church can operate
[10:24] in because you're his wife so you see
[10:27] these things in operation the
[10:29] manifestation of miracles and healings
[10:31] and and divine miracles that are taking
[10:34] place the reason why these things are
[10:36] operating is because you know your
[10:38] position you you know who you are you
[10:41] have the safe the Lord or you keep
[10:42] stealing and you know sister Katie can
[10:45] go in there and she can mix up all kinds
[10:47] of cakes and make all kinds of different
[10:49] goodies for me and maybe they're not
[10:51] necessarily good for me but their
[10:53] goodies you know but she has the ability
[10:56] to go in there I have the ability to sit
[10:59] there and watch her bake me that cake
[11:01] and put that frosting on top of it it
[11:03] make me gain five pounds by just looking
[11:06] at it but I am watching her maybe she
[11:09] thinks that I'm just
[11:10] getting there watching her and I enjoy
[11:12] doing that as well but I'm also watching
[11:14] her in her position are you with me I'm
[11:18] watching her operate in her position as
[11:21] a wife and she's not hi I've never
[11:25] forced her to make me a cake I never
[11:27] forced her to cook me alfredo or make a
[11:29] steak or what not but she is operating
[11:32] in her office as a wife
[11:35] how much more about the Queen of Heaven
[11:38] when you are operating around that that
[11:41] nobody else knows about and then they
[11:43] think well maybe they're just the odd
[11:45] power may you know that's actually we
[11:47] are hot balls to the world but we are
[11:49] operating in a realm we're not from this
[11:55] world we came from God into God we shall
[11:59] return this earth is not my home
[12:02] I'm just a passing through you see we're
[12:05] all operating in this realm of the
[12:07] natural but we were birthed for a
[12:10] heavenly place you are in God's mind not
[12:14] to not to go through time or not to go
[12:18] through trials those things are going to
[12:19] come but the Prophet said that we bypass
[12:22] a theophany to come into this world to
[12:26] be tempted by sin there's got to be
[12:28] somebody that operates in this realm
[12:31] that overcomes to this age I wonder if
[12:35] I'm talking to such a lady tonight that
[12:37] knows where she's standing knows who she
[12:40] is knows what she's capable of you're
[12:43] not asking too much your heavenly
[12:45] husband is the God of heaven the God
[12:48] that created the Sun the moons and the
[12:50] stars and you have the ability to change
[12:54] situations hallelujah we're here we're
[12:59] living in Bible days again are you with
[13:02] me we're living in Bible days again and
[13:04] this is a continuation of the book of
[13:08] Acts the Spirit has given life and
[13:11] quicken the word that was spoken to us
[13:13] in this hour by a restored word and it
[13:16] is bringing these things to come to pass
[13:18] they say the so this is God I'm not
[13:23] trying to pump you up tonight I'm just
[13:24] telling you who you are
[13:26] you see it's okay if somebody reminds me
[13:29] I'm a Spencer and it don't offend me
[13:31] because I'm a Spencer I Know Who I am it
[13:33] don't offend me when somebody calls me
[13:35] the Sun Iran spritzer because that's who
[13:37] I am I'm his son
[13:39] it does not offend me when people tell
[13:42] me and look at me as a son of God
[13:44] because that's exactly who I am
[13:47] I'm not asked of too much of myself
[13:50] because that is who I am I am stepping
[13:54] into the potentials that he has ordained
[13:57] us to be standing in this hour
[13:59] this ain't a show this is God you're in
[14:03] God's mine before the world began and
[14:05] you are here playing out the drama
[14:08] they're saying to show the miracles that
[14:11] you're seeing this ain't a show like you
[14:13] would see in in men's ministries like a
[14:15] a Alan how that he would he would try to
[14:18] create he would try to create miracles
[14:20] just to stir people's faith Perry green
[14:23] caught him one time when he was he was
[14:25] there in a meeting and there was a a
[14:28] Alan said now this man right here hasn't
[14:30] walked for 20 years he's not walked for
[14:33] 20 years and he was laying there in the
[14:35] cart and hey Alan rich over and grabbed
[14:38] that sheet off of him and that man was
[14:40] fully dressed had a shoes on and he took
[14:43] off running
[14:43] Perry green caught him in this act and
[14:46] he asked him about it and a a Alan said
[14:48] well yeah you know and that was that is
[14:51] true brother Perry green he said but
[14:53] look how it blessed the people how it
[14:56] stirred them played their hearts and
[14:58] their faith to go and believe in a God
[15:00] that can do those things it was just a
[15:02] circus act but I am NOT introducing you
[15:06] to a circus act I am introducing you to
[15:10] the most genuine message that's ever
[15:12] struck the face of the earth
[15:14] you ain't gotta make this up this is
[15:16] reality this is a safe the Lord these
[15:22] things are promised to us you look at
[15:24] the Ministry of this day and you see
[15:27] you see brother branham's ministry when
[15:29] he was standing there and there was a
[15:31] man by the name of up saw he was a
[15:33] congressman had I had a great NAA my
[15:37] major a major distinguished career in
[15:40] his life even ran for president and how
[15:44] he how he'd went through life and he
[15:46] headed ahead I hadn't hadn't walked
[15:47] since he was 18 years old he was
[15:50] crippled for 66 years he got hurt in a
[15:53] farming accident when he fell off a hay
[15:55] wagon and he broke his back but there in
[15:59] a moment of time wins I say if the Lord
[16:01] was spoken he said mr. Upshaw do you
[16:05] have a red suit and here mr. Upshaw was
[16:09] wearing a blue suit and mr. Upshaw says
[16:12] matter of fact I do I just bought it he
[16:14] said thus saith the Lord you're healed
[16:17] rise up and walked hallelujah and he
[16:20] walked until he died what was it it was
[16:23] genuine that these were the things of
[16:26] God when you look at Florence
[16:27] Nightingale Sherlock how that she had
[16:30] dropped all the way down to 50 pounds
[16:32] when diseases and robbed her of her
[16:34] strength and she she sent word Lord let
[16:37] let brother branham come here I'll pay
[16:39] how I pay for these things I'll pay for
[16:41] the tickets to come here he said I can't
[16:43] do it I've already got former
[16:45] commitments that are made here and when
[16:47] she found out that william branham was
[16:49] moving he was flying over to england to
[16:52] preach there and to go abroad she bought
[16:55] a ticket got on the plane and she was
[16:58] almost gone and she went to a spot that
[17:00] her that her veins were so low that the
[17:04] nurse that was traveling with her could
[17:05] no longer get the needle in her veins to
[17:08] feed her from it from a back she'd went
[17:11] solo now anybody can say you're healed
[17:14] but when you say thus save the Lord and
[17:16] all of a sudden you go
[17:18] you go from fifty pounds to a lady
[17:21] that's done to a woman that is that is
[17:23] that is seen as a hundred and fifty five
[17:26] pound woman completely ho anybody can
[17:29] say you're healed but then for a miracle
[17:32] to take place for thus saith the Lord to
[17:34] be spoken over somebody that you
[17:36] wouldn't give a nickel for there lie
[17:38] and watch some resurrect I'd say that
[17:42] this is God that is amongst us this is
[17:45] not a so this is Ella ham at work this
[17:48] is what he does
[17:50] hallelujah miracles miracles are not and
[17:54] that miracles are not Extra Ordinary to
[17:56] God they're ordinary to him
[17:58] they're just natural they come natural
[18:01] to him because he's God we talk about
[18:06] these things and we think my if we could
[18:10] just see those things again
[18:12] we could see those things how it would
[18:15] build our faith I want to show you a
[18:17] miracle an absolute miracle sister Julia
[18:22] would you stand for me all right there's
[18:26] a miracle Satan swore that he destroyed
[18:29] her and packing on the inside of her
[18:32] soul is the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[18:33] that's a miracle so now you have seen a
[18:37] miracle god bless you what you say I
[18:42] didn't see that but I want you to know
[18:44] that you came in this world you were
[18:47] born in this world with a nature with a
[18:49] nature to do after sin and go after
[18:52] seeing that all of a sudden something
[18:54] pain and stop the devil's plans that
[18:57] turned that nature that would make you
[18:59] run after the enemy that would make you
[19:02] do ungodly things and all of a sudden
[19:04] because a meeting with him
[19:07] you no longer thirst after the things of
[19:10] the world but you long you long for the
[19:13] things of God I smoked all I walk to and
[19:18] I drink all I want to and I took a drink
[19:22] and I smoke one bit of dope for the last
[19:25] 13 years because I haven't wanted to he
[19:29] came and he took every bit of that
[19:32] desire away from me I'm talking about a
[19:37] god that is a god that's living a god
[19:42] that's with us
[19:43] these things are a paradox they're
[19:46] incredible matru this is him
[19:50] Bible says in Hebrews warned that God
[19:53] who at sundry times and in divers
[19:57] manners spake in times past under the
[20:00] fathers by the prophets hath in these
[20:03] last days spoken unto us by his son whom
[20:06] he has appointed heir of all things and
[20:11] by whom also he made the world's who
[20:14] being the brightness of his glory and
[20:16] the Express image of his person and
[20:18] upholding all things by the word of his
[20:24] power when he had by himself purged our
[20:29] sins and sat down at the right hand of
[20:32] the Majesty on high what is Paul trying
[20:35] to do he is trying to show that God
[20:38] purposed all things in Christ and that
[20:41] Christ was the Express image of God it
[20:45] is his work that upholds all things that
[20:48] Greek word uphold it means is a Greek
[20:52] word if that of upholding his fearow and
[20:54] it means to bring to bear forth to come
[20:58] to reach to endure and to carry it is to
[21:01] carry some burden to bear with oneself
[21:05] and the move by bearing or to be
[21:07] conveyed conveyed with a suggestion of
[21:10] force or speed I want to tell you that
[21:14] God's got this it is his word that
[21:17] carries her burdens it is his word that
[21:20] takes care of you it is his word that
[21:22] upholds you when you don't feel like you
[21:24] even go a mile on he's got this brothers
[21:27] hand if he got the book in there he'll
[21:30] bring the results he's got this it ain't
[21:34] for me to figure out all I know is that
[21:37] there is a God that is backing up his
[21:40] work this ain't some sideshow that we're
[21:44] trying to introduce and they were trying
[21:46] to say that the pillar of fire is here
[21:47] trying to get your minds who imagine a
[21:50] God that was he's here
[21:55] he's right here right now and we're

[28:23] criticizing our Lord he was standing up
[28:26] for Dolores Grimm when everybody else

[28:30] he was standing up for Tom hill
[28:39] it's his word that upholds all things he
[28:43] bears all things it's he that's been
[28:45] speaking to us if all you see today and
[28:48] all you hear today is me you have missed
[28:50] it if all you seen was a man you missed
[28:52] it but you've got to hear that voice
[28:54] behind the voice that makes that voice
[28:57] come to life makes this word live if he
[29:02] wasn't with me there's no way that stand
[29:04] up in front of you if I didn't believe
[29:07] that the God that changed my soul and
[29:09] transformed my vessel and maybe a new
[29:11] creature there's no way that I stand up
[29:14] in front of you people and try to
[29:15] proclaim a God that was dead I don't
[29:17] have to do that tonight
[29:19] I'm not telling about a God that died
[29:22] 2,000 years ago I'm talking about a God
[29:25] that raised 2,000 years ago then he came
[29:27] back in the form of a pillar fire and
[29:30] filled 120 vessels on the day of
[29:33] Pentecost that's exactly what God is
[29:35] wanting to do he's one to feel your life
[29:39] that's God's strategy is to feel empty
[29:43] vessels and shake the world bomb how
[29:46] about it young people hello somebody how
[29:51] about it
[29:52] will you let God's strategy go to work
[29:55] in your life the reason why you're here
[30:00] is because God said so the reason while
[30:03] this is son today is because God said so
[30:05] the reason why you come to this message
[30:08] because God said so the reason why
[30:10] you're blessed to hear this message is
[30:12] because God said so the reason why there
[30:15] is an anointing on your life it's
[30:16] because God said so hallelujah when the
[30:23] children of Esau were there in the land
[30:25] of Moab in a pitch there they pitched
[30:27] there in the plains of Moab and the
[30:30] Moabites were afraid
[30:31] because they seen what the God of Israel
[30:35] had done to the Amur heights to the king
[30:37] Sion and all they'd watch those things
[30:39] and they would begin to get afraid
[30:42] because they were camping out in their
[30:45] backyard I'd say all hail is nervous all
[30:50] Hales nervous because you're camping out
[30:52] down here still hallelujah you're not
[30:56] planning to leave until the body change
[30:59] you may you may enjoy talking about
[31:02] death and you may enjoy the idea of time
[31:04] but I sure don't enjoy the idea of dying
[31:06] God is not the god of the dead God is
[31:10] the god of the lift I don't like to talk
[31:12] about being put in a casket though if
[31:14] God makes me go by that way that's
[31:16] exactly where I'll go I ain't got no
[31:18] choice but I tell you one thing there is
[31:21] something that I desire as a Christian
[31:23] to experience with everything that's
[31:25] within me I desire to experience the
[31:28] transformation of this body brother
[31:31] Branham said it would sting just a
[31:32] little bit but you'll be changed in a
[31:35] moment in a twinkling of an eye a body
[31:37] that will not fade away a body that will
[31:40] not perish
[31:40] that God's packet he's back in the
[31:45] victory home today it's this word that
[31:48] will change our mortal bodies I'm gonna
[31:54] be gold
[31:59] whoa hello that's why Hale hates you
[32:07] because you believe it
[32:08] and you're the people but here the
[32:12] Moabites were afraid they were afraid
[32:15] because they were camping out in their
[32:17] backyard but you see they weren't
[32:20] accustomed to the voice they weren't
[32:23] accustomed to the voice like the
[32:25] children of Israel were because God had
[32:28] told Moses in Deuteronomy chapter 2 and
[32:31] 9 distress not the Moabites nor contend
[32:35] with him in battle
[32:36] they didn't have nothing to worry about
[32:38] because God had told him not to do it
[32:41] but here they are and because of this
[32:44] fear that is upon them the King Balak of
[32:47] moba the Moab he because of this fear
[32:50] that they are going to come in and
[32:52] encroach on his land overtake his land
[32:55] that he raises up a hireling prophet by
[32:59] the name of Balaam and Balaam was only
[33:01] concerned with Fame money and popularity
[33:04] I said we've got a whole lot of Harlan
[33:07] prophets in the land today
[33:09] that's only concerned with money fame
[33:12] and popularity I could care less if you
[33:15] ever know my name but as long as you
[33:17] know that god that's on the inside
[33:19] that's the only thing that I'm worried
[33:22] about bailet hired out Balaam to go out
[33:29] there and curse the children of Israel
[33:31] but how can you curse what God is
[33:33] blessed
[33:34] so how even though he'll may be against
[33:38] you how can they curse you when God's
[33:40] already commanded a blessing upon you
[33:43] are you with me the seed and Balaam
[33:48] stood up there he should have known
[33:51] better when he donkey goes to talking to
[33:55] you better watch out
[33:58] I gotta be careful right there
[34:06] some of you know it's okay
[34:10] Balaam I'm still human I'm not going to
[34:19] explain it
[34:20] Balaam tried to stop this he tried his
[34:24] very best to stop Israel but it couldn't
[34:27] stop God's program and Balak hired him
[34:30] out to curse Israel but instead of
[34:33] cursing their me bless them the Bible
[34:36] said in numbers 23 and 19 that God is
[34:39] not a man that he should lie neither the
[34:41] son of man that he should repent have
[34:44] they said and and shall he not do it or
[34:47] have they spoken and shall he not make
[34:49] it good
[34:50] behold I have received a commandment to
[34:52] bless and he has blessed and I cannot
[34:55] reverse it he has not the held the
[34:57] iniquity and Jacob neither had they seen
[34:59] the perverseness and in Israel the Lord
[35:02] his God is with him the shout of the
[35:05] king is among him we are serving a god
[35:09] that has blessed us and cannot reverse
[35:11] it the sound of the king is in our camp
[35:14] the message of the King is in our midst
[35:18] Alleluia is restoring his wife to her
[35:22] full position and it is this restored
[35:25] word that God in flesh is in a person of
[35:30] his broad and is restoring all things we
[35:34] are serving a God that lives and rules
[35:37] and reigns in the hearts of his children
[35:39] you're a son of God you're a daughter of
[35:42] God so stop going around breathing the
[35:45] devil's lies stop going around and
[35:48] saying with the devil told you the devil
[35:50] said this and devil said that you know
[35:52] the devil's a liar so stop whispering
[35:55] those lies from your voice and start
[35:58] confessing what God said about you start
[36:02] confessing these things God snapped the
[36:05] picture of you before the foundation of
[36:07] the world and he knew every aspect and
[36:09] every character is
[36:10] take how fat you be how skinny you be

[36:25] everything about you only your
[36:27] characteristics and you may think that
[36:30] all of these things that are going on
[36:31] score a mess up God's plan God's mapped
[36:34] a picture of you before the foundation
[36:36] of the world and what he thought of you
[36:39] then is what you will be he knew what
[36:43] you were
[36:44] he ain't excited about all your mistakes
[36:46] and excited about your failures God knew
