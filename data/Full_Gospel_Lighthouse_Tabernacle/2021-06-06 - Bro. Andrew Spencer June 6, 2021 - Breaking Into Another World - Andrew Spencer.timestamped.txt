[47:34] than words on a page to me but you're
[47:36] here

[47:40] your throne of mercy towards us

[47:46] bodies and we just ask that you be
[47:48] mindful to us

[47:53] bibles this morning we'd like to look
[47:54] over in the book of isaiah
[47:56] chapter 6 isaiah chapter 6 and then to
[48:01] john chapter 20.
[48:06] man isaiah chapter six
[48:09] this morning i'd like to speak to you
[48:11] this morning on breaking into another
[48:18] world
[48:32] hey man
[48:48] well
[48:52] i like that preacher myself
[48:55] well we won't bother
[48:58] won't bother maybe too many people but
[49:00] let's let's store up the devil's kingdom
[49:02] a little bit this morning
[49:04] isaiah chapter six and verse one you
[49:07] ready to have church
[49:11] oh i just love it i love it
[49:16] no church like full gospel lighthouse
[49:18] let me tell you that
[49:22] oh man if you can't preach from this
[49:24] pulpit you just can't preach
[49:27] i believe there's a spirit of liberty
[49:29] here in this church that
[49:32] i'll tell you we might as well we might
[49:34] as well just go ahead and thrash the
[49:35] devil this morning
[49:38] isaiah chapter 6 and verse 1. in the
[49:41] year
[49:41] that king uzziah died i saw also the
[49:44] lord sitting upon the throne high and
[49:46] lifted up
[49:47] and his train filled the temple above it
[49:50] stood the seraphims
[49:51] each one had six wings with with twain
[49:54] he covered his face and with twain he
[49:55] covered his feet
[49:57] and with twenty did fly and one cried
[49:59] unto another and said holy holy holy is
[50:02] the lord of hosts the whole earth is
[50:04] full of his glory
[50:06] and the post of the door moved at the
[50:08] voice of him that cried and the house
[50:10] was
[50:10] filled with smoke then said i woe is me
[50:14] for i am undone because i
[50:16] am a man of unclean lips and i dwell in
[50:18] the midst of a people
[50:20] of unclean lips for mine eyes have seen
[50:22] the king
[50:23] the lord of hosts then flew one of the
[50:26] seraphims unto me having a life coal in
[50:28] his hands
[50:29] which he had taken with the tongs from
[50:31] off the altar
[50:33] and he laid it upon my mouth and said lo
[50:35] this hath touched thy lips and that
[50:37] iniquity is taken away
[50:38] and thy sin purged also i heard the
[50:42] voice of the lord saying whom shall i
[50:44] send and who will go for us
[50:47] and then said ah here am i
[50:50] send me also john chapter 20 and verse
[50:53] 19
[50:54] and as you're making your way there i'd
[50:56] like to
[50:57] read this quote to you this morning from
[50:59] hear ye him
[51:02] brother brown said he said you can take
[51:03] an egg
[51:05] that a hen is supposed to set on to
[51:07] hatch it and you put that egg in an
[51:09] incubator where it's just warm light
[51:10] that incubator will hatch the egg just
[51:13] the same as the chick
[51:14] or the hen will itself because it's the
[51:17] atmosphere
[51:18] that does the hatching it's the same
[51:20] thing in a meeting of this type it could
[51:22] be possible tonight and also probable
[51:25] it will be that there could be an hour
[51:27] of this next hour on that clock
[51:29] that there wouldn't be one center or
[51:31] backslider left in here
[51:33] without being right with god it could be
[51:36] that
[51:36] every sick an afflicted person could be
[51:39] made well
[51:40] and go out of here glorifying god
[51:43] this could break into a repeat of
[51:46] pentecost
[51:47] if the atmosphere gets right see
[51:50] the atmosphere to bring such results
[51:53] would be the holy spirit
[51:54] if he can get every heart in one accord
[51:58] john chapter 20 and verse 19 here jesus
[52:02] appears to his disciples and said the
[52:04] bible said then
[52:05] the same day at evening being the first
[52:07] day of the week
[52:08] when the doors were shut where the
[52:10] disciples were assembled for fear of the
[52:12] jews jesus came
[52:14] and stood in the midst and said unto
[52:16] them peace be
[52:18] unto you and when he had when he had so
[52:22] said he showed unto them his hands and
[52:24] said
[52:25] then were the disciples glad when they
[52:27] saw the lord
[52:29] then said jesus to them again peace be
[52:31] unto you as my father has sent me
[52:34] even so i send you may god bless his
[52:37] word you may be seated
[52:39] in the presence of the lord as we said
[52:40] we'd like to speak to you on breaking
[52:43] breaking into another world and as we
[52:46] we have read and we see the the vision
[52:50] that is caught up and it was it's even
[52:51] more than a vision that you see
[52:53] the scene that is put out before you in
[52:55] isaiah chapter six and
[52:57] and we know that the prophet would be so
[53:00] influenced to preach from this text of
[53:02] isaiah chapter six
[53:03] and especially from 1962 on down to
[53:07] 1963-64 you'll hear brother branham
[53:09] preaching on influence
[53:11] influence and of another influence of
[53:12] the angel and those things
[53:15] and here you're you're breaking into a
[53:17] scene that
[53:18] that that that that you're seeing where
[53:20] the king use i had
[53:21] had just been taken off the scene notice
[53:24] in john chapter 20 as we've just read
[53:26] that jesus this is after his
[53:28] resurrection
[53:29] and that he appears to his disciples
[53:32] and notice that jesus is breaking in
[53:36] into into their world and notice that
[53:39] jesus
[53:39] is the best at breaking and entering but
[53:41] when jesus breaks in there's nothing
[53:43] that is broken
[53:44] but everything is made whole and
[53:46] everything is kept the same except for
[53:48] the people
[53:49] that are in the room and notice that
[53:51] we're living in an hour when we have
[53:53] been told to come up hither
[53:55] we have been called out of the things of
[53:57] this world of laodicea
[53:59] to come out of her my people and notice
[54:03] what when we read over in revelations
[54:05] chapter 3 when we read about our church
[54:08] age
[54:08] about the conditions of the church age
[54:10] and you see the reward that is given
[54:13] that christ himself is standing at the
[54:15] door he's not standing at the door of
[54:17] every individual
[54:18] but here he is standing at the door of
[54:21] churches
[54:22] and churches have shut them out shut him
[54:24] out in this day
[54:26] they have shut him out by and they've
[54:27] bound him there by their creeds and
[54:29] dogmas and ideologies of humanity
[54:32] that they've came up with and they have
[54:34] kept jesus christ
[54:36] bound at the door but the church all
[54:38] they would have to do
[54:40] is open that door and christ would come
[54:42] in
[54:43] but there is a people on the earth today
[54:46] that
[54:46] christ has determined that they would be
[54:49] his chosen place
[54:51] of worship that he would come and dwell
[54:53] on the inside of them
[54:55] and he would be and he would birth them
[54:57] to be a real
[54:58] kingdom a real priestly and a godly
[55:01] people that
[55:02] god would come and he would determine
[55:05] that he would set himself
[55:06] on that people and god is taking a
[55:09] people
[55:10] of humanity and breaking them into a
[55:13] realm
[55:13] of divinity and he is taking them out
[55:16] past the realm
[55:17] of this human world and the senses of
[55:20] this world that we're living in
[55:22] and even though we don't see the pillar
[55:24] fire sometimes with our eyes
[55:26] yet he's here and yet he's moving and we
[55:29] realize that we're living in an hour of
[55:31] advancement
[55:32] and i think it's such an amazing thing
[55:34] that the bride of jesus christ
[55:36] is advancing like never before she's had
[55:38] this message
[55:39] for over 50 some years but now she knows
[55:43] exactly who she
[55:44] is she's advanced in the word she's
[55:47] matured in the word
[55:48] she has a right to preach she has a
[55:51] right to stand
[55:52] she has a right to worship because she's
[55:54] standing in the hour of advancement
[55:57] now we cannot get past our head but the
[56:00] body has got to follow
[56:02] but you find it amazing that every time
[56:04] that god does something
[56:06] the world also does something as well
[56:09] it's a spirit of the day that we're
[56:11] living in
[56:11] of all ages that there are twins
[56:14] throughout all things
[56:15] and if the bride is advancing the church
[56:18] is advancing
[56:19] and you'll see the church is advancing
[56:20] in members but all they want is a coffee
[56:23] shop and they want somebody to tickle
[56:25] their ears
[56:25] there's more people sitting outside the
[56:27] sanctuary than there is on in the inside
[56:30] of the sanctuary
[56:32] but the bride is the complete opposite
[56:34] she has
[56:35] made her way into the inner courts of
[56:38] the holies of holies
[56:39] and she is advancing when the pillar of
[56:42] fire comes down and condescends upon her
[56:44] she is advancing in the hour when the
[56:47] son of man is revealing himself
[56:50] like never before and you watch the
[56:52] advancements of science when everything
[56:54] the last hundred years that we've been
[56:56] living is the greatest time of the
[56:58] advancement of science
[57:00] because everything is moving higher
[57:02] everybody's trying to get bigger
[57:04] everybody's trying to get taller
[57:06] men of industry are building taller
[57:08] skyscrapers
[57:10] they're they're they're not satisfied
[57:12] with just this style
[57:14] this style or they want to do something
[57:16] different because
[57:17] man is in a state of unsatisfaction
[57:20] but there is a satisfaction to a soul
[57:23] of a real son and daughter of god but
[57:25] you realize that science is
[57:27] is setting records like never before
[57:30] they're coming out with
[57:31] with greater technology they're coming
[57:33] out with greater advancements
[57:35] and it's showing you the age that we're
[57:37] living in
[57:38] and i was listening to a tape the other
[57:40] day and brother random was speaking
[57:41] about humanity
[57:42] that even in its perverted and fallen
[57:44] state that you can look upon them
[57:46] and see them how they build such
[57:48] beautiful houses how they take and they
[57:50] they develop such beautiful things and
[57:53] there they
[57:54] are they're developing these things but
[57:56] yet they're in a fallen and perverted
[57:58] state and can create a mansion
[58:00] like we have here or our houses that we
[58:02] have it's an amazing thing
[58:04] but it is a type and a foreshadow that
[58:07] we're going to a mansion
[58:09] where we're not in a perverted state
[58:11] where we're not in a fallen state but
[58:13] we're going to a mansion
[58:14] and jesus said that in my father's house
[58:18] there are many mansions here we have no
[58:21] continuing city
[58:23] but we are going to a city
[58:26] hallelujah you see but science has
[58:29] always taken man
[58:31] forward they're always taking you
[58:33] forward into greater things and breaking
[58:35] into the mind
[58:36] what are they doing they're breaking in
[58:38] as the prophet would say
[58:40] into god's laboratory but notice what
[58:42] science does
[58:43] science is not looking back to what
[58:45] science said hundreds of years ago but
[58:48] they're advancing
[58:49] they're moving forward into something
[58:51] else
[58:52] notice it's a constant moving higher
[58:55] they're breaking
[58:56] in every single day they're breaking in
[58:59] and eating more
[59:00] off of the tree of the knowledge of good
[59:03] and evil
[59:04] but we're not looking back either we're
[59:07] not looking back to what wesley said
[59:09] we're not
[59:10] looking back to what luther said this is
[59:12] the eagle age
[59:14] when the eagle the flying eagle
[59:16] anointing
[59:17] is taking a bride higher into a realm
[59:21] that only she could tap into now wesley
[59:24] he was under the man age and those men
[59:27] were under that man age
[59:28] but they can never break into this world
[59:31] that you know about
[59:34] as great as men that came up there of
[59:36] finney and wigglesworth
[59:37] and all of those men in the man age they
[59:39] can never come up here where you're
[59:41] living at
[59:42] but there has been an anointing that has
[59:44] allowed you to break in
[59:46] to the world of faith that has allowed
[59:48] you to break into the world of the seven
[59:50] seals
[59:50] to show you that everything is open to
[59:53] you that you don't have to wonder about
[59:55] it
[59:55] everything is released to you and you
[59:58] are in a state of satisfaction
[1:00:00] knowing that this message will take you
[1:00:03] from this world
[1:00:04] and put you into that world when
[1:00:06] everybody is dissatisfied
[1:00:08] with where they're living at the bride
[1:00:10] of jesus christ
[1:00:11] is advancing in the satisfaction of the
[1:00:14] son of man
[1:00:18] hallelujah
[1:00:21] hallelujah hallelujah notice when
[1:00:25] when isaiah i noticed his influence
[1:00:28] brother branham
[1:00:29] it's amazing to me that he would tap
[1:00:32] into this
[1:00:33] and we'd bring these things out right
[1:00:35] under right under the
[1:00:36] ministry of the seven seals that
[1:00:39] he would say now isaiah and uzziah were
[1:00:42] chumps
[1:00:43] he said they were friends and he said
[1:00:46] isaiah would have his
[1:00:47] eyes upon uzziah he'd watched him
[1:00:51] and notice he said he said you watch the
[1:00:54] effects
[1:00:54] of that vision that happened to the
[1:00:56] prophet it caused him because he was
[1:00:59] watching a man
[1:01:00] and any time you get your eyes on a man
[1:01:03] it will cause you to fall
[1:01:05] it will cause you to fail but i love
[1:01:07] what god does that whenever humanity
[1:01:10] falls
[1:01:11] he quickly gets his prophet's eyes back
[1:01:14] on the source
[1:01:15] of life because isaiah stood there and
[1:01:18] he watched
[1:01:19] as josiah got out of his place and he
[1:01:22] tried to usurp authority in an office
[1:01:24] that he wasn't destined to be in
[1:01:26] and i believe it's a great lesson for
[1:01:28] every one of us to never
[1:01:30] get out of our office to never get out
[1:01:32] of our office of worship or office of
[1:01:34] praise or
[1:01:35] office a pastor or office of deacon we
[1:01:38] should always stay
[1:01:39] in that realm that god has destined us
[1:01:41] to be
[1:01:42] but because uzziah stepped into a realm
[1:01:46] that he wasn't supposed to be in
[1:01:48] god smote him with leprosy and he died
[1:01:51] right
[1:01:52] there but you see what god did
[1:01:55] he took isaiah just a little bit higher
[1:01:58] and he caught him up and brought him
[1:02:00] into a world to show him
[1:02:02] not yaziah's fault but he brought him up
[1:02:05] to a place where
[1:02:06] he would get his eyes upon the lord
[1:02:09] jesus christ
[1:02:10] and when he broke into that world he
[1:02:13] seen something
[1:02:14] that he never went and seen before he
[1:02:16] broke into a sphere
[1:02:18] no more than what he'd been looking at
[1:02:21] down here on earth
[1:02:22] but he broke into a sphere that allowed
[1:02:25] him
[1:02:25] to look at the real hero
[1:02:29] you know you got your own heroes down
[1:02:31] here on earth but those heroes will fail
[1:02:33] you
[1:02:33] if i am your hero i will fail you if a
[1:02:36] man of god
[1:02:37] if a man in his own human ward in
[1:02:40] in his own garb and his own in his own
[1:02:43] robe if that man
[1:02:44] is your hero that man will let you down
[1:02:48] are you with me but i want you to know
[1:02:50] if you have a hero
[1:02:51] in christ jesus he's not going to let
[1:02:54] you down
[1:02:55] he is the superman of the day
[1:02:59] hallelujah hallelujah but notice
[1:03:02] what did he do he took him into a world
[1:03:06] where he
[1:03:06] looked and he saw the lord
[1:03:11] he took him into that world so that he
[1:03:14] would see
[1:03:16] what was real and as we go on thinking
[1:03:20] about these things of breaking into
[1:03:22] another world
[1:03:23] brother branham was dealing with some
[1:03:24] doctors one time and he was
[1:03:26] he was looking he was looking into he
[1:03:29] was looking in he was
[1:03:30] you remember when brother branham was
[1:03:31] talking about he would
[1:03:33] speak about the tree of knowledge that
[1:03:35] the more man eats off of that tree of
[1:03:37] knowledge
[1:03:37] the more he destroys himself you
[1:03:39] remember one time brother branham was
[1:03:41] having a conversation with doctors about
[1:03:43] this that he was talking to them and
[1:03:45] telling them that the more man eats
[1:03:47] off of it he destroys himself if he he
[1:03:50] ate gun powder and he killed himself he
[1:03:52] ate
[1:03:52] he ate automobiles and he killed himself
[1:03:54] and he and he ate atomic bombs and
[1:03:56] the more he eats the more he destroys
[1:03:58] himself you remember the conversation
[1:04:00] that they were having
[1:04:01] and they they spoke to brother branham
[1:04:02] and said well now now mr branham
[1:04:05] now now even if those things weren't
[1:04:07] created
[1:04:08] man would still die but brother branham
[1:04:11] told him said now look
[1:04:12] he said if they would have never left
[1:04:14] the tree of life they would have never
[1:04:16] killed themself
[1:04:17] you see because because they only kept
[1:04:20] eating on the tree of knowledge
[1:04:22] and if you eat on the tree of knowledge
[1:04:24] and the tree of intellect
[1:04:26] it'll only take you so high i want you
[1:04:29] to know you can reason your way up
[1:04:31] so far but then it's got to come to a
[1:04:34] world
[1:04:35] of faith in the world the anointing
[1:04:37] keeps coming you can try to figure out
[1:04:39] how the
[1:04:40] pillar fire moves and you can try to
[1:04:42] reason it out
[1:04:43] how we preach a message how we preach a
[1:04:46] message that'll put you in a body change
[1:04:48] and in your own humanity you can't
[1:04:50] figure out how in the world this is
[1:04:52] going to happen
[1:04:53] but then you've got to break into
[1:04:55] another world
[1:04:56] that world of faith will show you that
[1:04:59] these things
[1:05:00] are to be are you with me it'll tell you
[1:05:04] that there is real leadership that'll
[1:05:06] put you in a rapture
[1:05:08] that this world is in our home but you
[1:05:10] see the more you climb up that tree of
[1:05:12] knowledge
[1:05:13] the more you destroy yourself and not
[1:05:16] you can only get so high
[1:05:18] on the tree of knowledge but if you ever
[1:05:21] get one time on the tree of life
[1:05:23] he'll allow you to keep climbing higher
[1:05:25] he won't put you down he won't kick you
[1:05:27] off
[1:05:27] but he'll lift you higher you ever been
[1:05:30] to those amusement parks and
[1:05:32] and they got this they got this ride
[1:05:34] they call it the drop zone
[1:05:36] if you ever been on anybody ever been on
[1:05:37] that thing i know there's a few people
[1:05:39] loving things
[1:05:40] but if you don't know what i'm talking
[1:05:42] about this thing's a tower and this
[1:05:44] tower will take you all the way up
[1:05:46] over top of the amusement park and you
[1:05:47] can see everything
[1:05:49] there is on the inside of that part you
[1:05:51] can look up there but it's only for a
[1:05:53] few seconds you might as well get ready
[1:05:54] because your feet's going past your head
[1:05:56] and your stomach's going up to your
[1:05:57] throat
[1:05:58] but you're able to look out across the
[1:06:01] land and look at it for just a few
[1:06:03] seconds
[1:06:04] and then they drop you like a bad habit
[1:06:07] but i want you to know that when god
[1:06:09] lifts you up and he
[1:06:10] is your high tower he don't drop you
[1:06:13] down
[1:06:13] he lifts you up so that the higher you
[1:06:16] get the more you see the closer you look
[1:06:19] the more you'll see that he is the great
[1:06:22] i am
[1:06:23] [Applause]
[1:06:26] you see it's beyond human reasoning that
[1:06:30] a person
[1:06:31] that would be diagnosed with cancer
[1:06:33] could live
[1:06:34] when the doctor said he's going to die
[1:06:36] after they said he's going to die a few
[1:06:38] seconds or a few months later
[1:06:40] it's beyond human reasoning that a man
[1:06:42] with cancer
[1:06:43] would be sitting in a service but the
[1:06:46] world of faith
[1:06:47] was broken to so that a man with
[1:06:50] conditions that were more than humanity
[1:06:53] has allowed to be setting in a building
[1:06:55] like this
[1:06:56] you see what it is it's a breaking in to
[1:06:59] a world
[1:07:00] of faith now it's just like a boy
[1:07:02] brother brandon would say like a boy
[1:07:04] that
[1:07:04] he said he said i can swim i can swim he
[1:07:07] said
[1:07:07] if he's standing there just flopping his
[1:07:09] hands on the water but he's still got
[1:07:11] his feet on the ground
[1:07:12] he ain't swimming but as soon as he
[1:07:14] drops or he jumps in
[1:07:16] then he begins to gurgle and then he
[1:07:18] begins to call for help that's the time
[1:07:20] that you gotta swim and when you get in
[1:07:23] trouble
[1:07:24] that's the time to realize that you were
[1:07:26] born to break into a world
[1:07:28] where everybody else can't swim like you
[1:07:32] but you are born to swim god if god
[1:07:35] put fins on a fish's back surely
[1:07:38] he can put sons and daughters in a place
[1:07:41] that they can come out of the world
[1:07:45] he didn't destined you to lay out us
[1:07:46] here he destroyed you to a bright age
[1:07:49] to live above laodicea not outside of
[1:07:52] laodicea above laodicea
[1:08:04] what's god looking for somebody that's
[1:08:07] willing
[1:08:09] somebody that's willing to to go beyond
[1:08:12] the humanity
[1:08:13] and notice what the bible said in romans
[1:08:15] 8 and 16 that the spirit
[1:08:17] itself beareth witness with our spirit
[1:08:20] that we
[1:08:20] are the children of god now i could read
[1:08:22] that every day in my life
[1:08:24] matter of fact i do but you could read
[1:08:26] that and every single time it does
[1:08:28] something
[1:08:28] on the inside of my heart that his
[1:08:30] spirit beareth witness with our spirit
[1:08:33] that we are the children of god
[1:08:36] and if children than heirs and heirs of
[1:08:39] god and joint heirs with christ
[1:08:41] if so be that we suffer with him that we
[1:08:43] may be also glorified together
[1:08:45] for i reckon does anybody reckon with me
[1:08:50] this morning
[1:08:51] i reckon that the sufferings of this
[1:08:53] present time
[1:08:54] are not worthy to be compared with the
[1:08:57] glory which shall be revealed in us
[1:08:59] for the earnest expectation of the
[1:09:02] creature waiteth
[1:09:03] it waiteth it weighed us all creation is
[1:09:06] groaning
[1:09:07] for this one thing the manifestation
[1:09:10] of the sons of god and you are in the
[1:09:14] hour there's never been an hour like
[1:09:16] this hour
[1:09:17] when sons are operating in a world
[1:09:20] that only sons can operate in hallelujah
[1:09:24] the church world can't move here
[1:09:26] the church world can't preach here the
[1:09:28] church world can't live here
[1:09:30] but sons can this
[1:09:34] is the hour
[1:09:38] of the elect now notice
[1:09:41] notice i want you to know that that
[1:09:44] before there was a creation
[1:09:46] there was a creator now we're very
[1:09:49] uh very familiar that he is the same
[1:09:54] can he say amen to the word of god this
[1:09:56] morning
[1:09:57] that he is the same and that this god
[1:10:01] who is our god fills all time
[1:10:04] space and eternity that's what the bible
[1:10:06] teaches us is that right
[1:10:08] so we can look at it in this context
[1:10:10] that he is
[1:10:12] but he is not going and he is not coming
[1:10:16] he's here so follow me in my thinking
[1:10:20] so here he is he has created
[1:10:23] you and before you were he was
[1:10:27] he always is always was and will forever
[1:10:31] be
[1:10:32] so we realize that when we see him come
[1:10:35] down
[1:10:36] in services like we're having don't ever
[1:10:38] take these things for granted
[1:10:40] what you're seeing amongst you is a move
[1:10:42] of god and what you need to do is not
[1:10:44] jump off the train but jump on the train
[1:10:47] and stay right on here because you see
[1:10:49] god is moving you into a world
[1:10:52] that only the elect can be moved into
[1:10:55] and if you get off of this train you are
[1:10:57] only showing what class of people that
[1:11:00] you are
[1:11:00] when the prophet would preach three
[1:11:02] kinds of believers
[1:11:04] you will only show your colors if you
[1:11:06] jump off the train with judas
[1:11:08] and if you jump off the train with the
[1:11:09] seventy that could not walk of jesus
[1:11:12] but i'm like the disciples that stood
[1:11:15] there
[1:11:15] when jesus asked them will you also turn
[1:11:17] away they said lord where will we go
[1:11:20] for you only have the word of eternal
[1:11:23] life
[1:11:24] so on this train that we're living on or
[1:11:28] abiding in if i can say it like that
[1:11:30] it's a move of god
[1:11:32] and what you're witnessing is the
[1:11:34] dispensation
[1:11:36] of the holy spirit dispersing himself
[1:11:39] just like joel said that in the last
[1:11:41] days i will pour my spirit out upon all
[1:11:44] flesh
[1:11:45] now notice what is always being laying
[1:11:48] there
[1:11:49] in scripture now the prophecy was
[1:11:51] already laying there
[1:11:52] in joel chapter 2 he was laying there
[1:11:55] but now you are seeing the manifestation
[1:11:58] of the holy spirit so let me say this to
[1:12:02] you
[1:12:02] the things that you have asked for they
[1:12:05] were already in his department where he
[1:12:07] could give them to you
[1:12:08] before you ever ask so let me put it to
[1:12:10] you like this
[1:12:11] your miracle is already in the room
[1:12:14] [Applause]
[1:12:20] if you could just realize that you're in
[1:12:23] a moment
[1:12:24] if you could just look at this that you
[1:12:26] are in a moment of the miraculous
[1:12:29] and all you have to do is look past your
[1:12:32] senses
[1:12:32] look past what you feel look past what
[1:12:35] you see
[1:12:36] and break into a world of eternity
[1:12:39] that the miraculous is standing before
[1:12:42] you
[1:12:43] hallelujah if you realize that there are
[1:12:45] two omnipotents here
[1:12:47] the miraculous will take place
[1:12:55] i can tell you when he dropped that in
[1:12:57] my heart that your miracle's already in
[1:12:59] the room
[1:13:02] so before let me let me just get real
[1:13:05] plain right here
[1:13:06] before i see the evidence before i see
[1:13:10] the evidence
[1:13:11] of complete freedom from sugar diabetes
[1:13:15] it's the elephant in the room so let's
[1:13:17] just call it out before we see the
[1:13:19] evidence of cancer leaving
[1:13:21] i already know that the miracle's in the
[1:13:23] room
[1:13:24] before i see the evidence of a baby
[1:13:26] walking down the aisle the miracle's
[1:13:28] already in the room
[1:13:30] before i see the evidence of prodigals
[1:13:32] walking through the back door
[1:13:34] the miracle is in the room before i see
[1:13:36] my mother-in-law my father-in-law
[1:13:38] and all these brothers and sisters that
[1:13:40] i prayed for i can say it with authority
[1:13:43] that the one that creates the miracle
[1:13:45] is in the room and if he's in the room
[1:13:47] nothing's going to stay the same
[1:13:49] and if he's in the room miracles got to
[1:13:51] happen deliverance has got to happen
[1:13:53] salvation has got to happen oh i tell
[1:13:56] you there's an acts 2
[1:13:57] 38 pouring out of the baptism of the
[1:13:59] holy ghost
[1:14:00] i can tell you you can try to stop me
[1:14:02] from preaching this
[1:14:03] but i got baptized into this preaching i
[1:14:06] got baptized into this thinking
[1:14:08] i got baptized into this so i can't get
[1:14:11] out of it
[1:14:12] i'm already in the water
[1:14:16] your miracle is in the room
[1:14:19] [Applause]
[1:14:26] hallelujah
[1:14:28] so the holy ghost was always the holy
[1:14:30] ghost
[1:14:31] the pillar fire was always the pillar of
[1:14:34] fire
[1:14:35] the cloud was always a cloud and before
[1:14:38] it let me put it to you like this it
[1:14:40] might be a little hard for some of you
[1:14:41] to understand
[1:14:42] it but let me put it to you in the form
[1:14:43] of predestination
[1:14:45] moses was always moses
[1:14:49] let me say it to you again ron spencer
[1:14:51] was always ron spencer
[1:14:53] katie spencer was always katy spencer
[1:14:56] it may not look like a son and a
[1:14:58] daughter of god at one point
[1:15:00] but by the predestination of god you
[1:15:03] were
[1:15:03] as the son before the foundation of the
[1:15:06] world
[1:15:06] and if you are a son you can operate as
[1:15:09] a heart
[1:15:10] you ain't changing you ain't wavering
[1:15:13] god ain't waiting
[1:15:14] he knows where you're at
[1:15:22] whether moses was on a mountain or
[1:15:24] whether he was in the valley
[1:15:26] moses was moses and before then he got
[1:15:29] in trouble
[1:15:30] then he was denny mike was mike jeff was
[1:15:33] jeff
[1:15:34] howden was out and i am i'm not changing
[1:15:38] i am a son of god
[1:15:48] oh let's break into a world that satan
[1:15:51] don't want us him
[1:15:53] but you can't keep us out of it
[1:15:59] where'd you get that material right from
[1:16:01] the bible
[1:16:04] if it's a bible teaching i'm going to
[1:16:05] teach the bible if it's a bible doctrine
[1:16:08] i'm going to preach a bible doctrine
[1:16:09] [Applause]
[1:16:12] hallelujah hallelujah we look not at the
[1:16:15] things which are seen but the things
[1:16:18] which are not seen what was it that
[1:16:21] jesus was looking at
[1:16:22] he was looking into another world when
[1:16:25] he was beginning to speak to nathanael
[1:16:28] and he said before philip called you i
[1:16:29] knew you i saw you
[1:16:31] when you were sitting underneath that
[1:16:32] tree and he began to speak to him
[1:16:35] he said when notice how me rabbi he said
[1:16:38] before
[1:16:38] philip called you i saw you when you
[1:16:40] were sitting there now what was jesus
[1:16:42] doing
[1:16:42] he was going back in his past now no
[1:16:45] matter what nathaniel's past was he was
[1:16:48] telling him of his future
[1:16:50] and he began to tell him he said because
[1:16:52] i said these things
[1:16:54] they'll believe us and say that i am the
[1:16:56] son of god
[1:16:57] he said but shortly you will see the
[1:16:59] angels of god ascending
[1:17:01] and descending upon the son of man
[1:17:04] what was he doing god was taking him
[1:17:07] into higher hatch he was taking him
[1:17:10] to deeper depths and the son of man was
[1:17:14] looking past
[1:17:15] what he saw
[1:17:19] oh you sat here in your condition
[1:17:22] you said here in your affirmatives you
[1:17:24] sat here in your sickness
[1:17:25] but i want to tell you the son of man's
[1:17:27] looking past
[1:17:30] he said well i'm not going all the way
[1:17:32] let me tell you he's looking past
[1:17:33] your own your own fears to go all the
[1:17:36] way
[1:17:36] there's a lot of people that are sitting
[1:17:38] on a fence if there is a fence there
[1:17:39] ain't a fence there's no neutral ground
[1:17:41] but there's a lot of people say well i'm
[1:17:43] gonna just stay close enough in case
[1:17:45] noah
[1:17:45] is a good man he'll let me in this ain't
[1:17:47] how this works
[1:17:49] but there's some people that are sitting
[1:17:50] on that fence of unbeliever make
[1:17:52] believer and believer
[1:17:54] i have chosen in whom's class i will be
[1:17:57] in
[1:17:57] i will be with david i will be with
[1:17:59] daniel i will be with noah
[1:18:01] i will be moses i will be with jesus i
[1:18:04] will be with wesley
[1:18:06] i will be with william branham i will be
[1:18:08] with the bride of the last day
[1:18:09] i have chosen the class that i am in so
[1:18:12] i've got to live
[1:18:14] in the class that i choose to be
[1:18:18] what is it it's a stepping in to another
[1:18:21] sphere
[1:18:22] if you're living in a spot of
[1:18:23] justification if you're living at that
[1:18:26] spot
[1:18:27] you can look back into another world
[1:18:29] that you just came out of
[1:18:32] just come out of a sinful world now
[1:18:34] you're in a spot of justification
[1:18:36] but if you're in a spot of
[1:18:37] sanctification you can look back into
[1:18:39] the world that you came out of a
[1:18:40] justification
[1:18:41] but if you are in the baptism of the
[1:18:44] holy ghost
[1:18:45] in the stature of a full son of god
[1:18:48] you can look back into another sphere
[1:18:51] that you came out of
[1:18:52] and if you i've not come far enough just
[1:18:56] keep
[1:18:56] walking just keep walking
[1:19:01] i reminded when the prophet said one of
[1:19:03] these days
[1:19:04] he said you just keep walking you just
[1:19:06] keep walking and before
[1:19:08] long you'll get so light that you can
[1:19:10] just walk up on in the rapture
[1:19:13] oh you can get caught up in the world
[1:19:15] you're in or you can break into another
[1:19:16] one
[1:19:17] there's another world for me there's
[1:19:19] another life for me
[1:19:20] there's another destination for me and
[1:19:23] it ain't hawaii
[1:19:24] it's a place a land that is there's
[1:19:27] flowing milk and honey
[1:19:28] it's a land of the holy ghost it's a
[1:19:30] land where the lamb is the light
[1:19:37] hallelujah and we're seeing him more
[1:19:40] evident before our eyes
[1:19:41] that this is him if i told you that i
[1:19:45] saw the pillar firing here about 10
[1:19:46] minutes ago would you believe me
[1:19:49] so if i tell you that you know i'm not
[1:19:51] telling you that by my own human
[1:19:53] emotions
[1:19:53] i'm telling you that because he allowed
[1:19:55] me to see him what is that
[1:19:57] that's the manifestation of him because
[1:20:00] he
[1:20:00] always comes behind his word now whether
[1:20:04] i see him or whether i don't i know that
[1:20:06] he's there well how can you know that
[1:20:07] brother answer
[1:20:08] he said where two or three are gathered
[1:20:10] in my name there i'll be in the midst of
[1:20:12] them
[1:20:12] so whether i see him whether i feel him
[1:20:15] whether i don't
[1:20:16] but if he shows me himself it's only to
[1:20:19] vindicate
[1:20:20] that the preaching of the word is right
[1:20:22] on the mark
[1:20:26] this is your hour this is your moment
[1:20:28] this is your visitation
[1:20:30] this is the hour let me tell you you get
[1:20:34] on a plane
[1:20:35] and you're ready to get off at atlanta
[1:20:37] are you ready to get off over
[1:20:39] over in california what do you do you
[1:20:41] grab your bags and you get off the plane
[1:20:43] because that's the spot that you're
[1:20:45] looking for now let me tell you
[1:20:47] if you're looking out the terminal and
[1:20:49] it doesn't say
[1:20:50] gate b12 or revelations three or
[1:20:53] revelations 21
[1:20:54] 22 then you need to stay on a plane a
[1:20:57] little bit longer
[1:21:00] but if you're on the plane and you look
[1:21:02] out there
[1:21:03] and you've met your destination you can
[1:21:06] grab your bags
[1:21:07] you can walk off knowing that you have
[1:21:09] made it to where you were going
[1:21:12] and i ain't gonna stop walking i ain't
[1:21:14] gonna stop packing these bags of the
[1:21:16] holy ghost
[1:21:17] until everybody's on the plane with me
[1:21:20] but before you ride you gotta have a
[1:21:26] token
[1:21:28] my goodness my goodness
[1:21:31] yeah i'll tell you what this it's a
[1:21:33] little bit bigger than me this morning
[1:21:37] it's breaking into another world you
[1:21:39] remember when brother branham was up
[1:21:40] here on that mountain
[1:21:42] he got up here praising god that little
[1:21:44] squirrel was down there chattering
[1:21:46] he looked up there and he figured out
[1:21:48] why that squirrel was chattering he got
[1:21:49] to looking up there
[1:21:50] and there was an eagle up there there
[1:21:52] was an ego up there and he said
[1:21:54] he began at talking eagle said you know
[1:21:55] i could shoot you in a matter of seconds
[1:21:57] he said even though i wouldn't have he
[1:21:58] said but i could shoot you and he said
[1:22:00] that thing wasn't scared of me
[1:22:01] he said because he knew that he could
[1:22:03] set his wings
[1:22:05] into an atmosphere and be gone in a
[1:22:07] matter of seconds
[1:22:08] and if you could ever set your wings
[1:22:10] into an atmosphere
[1:22:11] of the holy ghost you won't worry about
[1:22:13] the chatter of the squirrels that are
[1:22:14] down there on the ground
[1:22:16] because the squirrels ain't going to get
[1:22:17] to you when you go up there let me tell
[1:22:19] you you can let laodicea criticize you
[1:22:21] you can let them make fun of you little
[1:22:23] make fun of this holy ghost but just set
[1:22:25] your wings
[1:22:26] to the atmosphere of the holy ghost
[1:22:28] it'll take you into another world
[1:22:30] that you don't know nothing about it'll
[1:22:32] put you into a body change
[1:22:34] that the prophet told me that i was
[1:22:36] going to be a part of
[1:22:37] and i believe that the atmosphere is
[1:22:39] here of the holy spirit that the
[1:22:41] miraculous can be
[1:22:43] done when the atmosphere is said that we
[1:22:46] will break into
[1:22:47] another pentecost just like in acts 2.
[1:22:53] he says well i ain't never received the
[1:22:54] holy ghost you can have it
[1:22:57] he said well i never spoke in tongues
[1:22:59] you don't have to speak in tongues i
[1:23:01] have the holy ghost
[1:23:02] but if you pray long enough you'll speak
[1:23:05] in tongues
[1:23:08] let me tell you you say well i i've
[1:23:10] never danced before let me tell you one
[1:23:12] good time
[1:23:14] let me tell you give one time you're
[1:23:15] either going to love everybody when you
[1:23:17] get drunk
[1:23:18] or you're going to dance or you could
[1:23:20] fight
[1:23:23] we say well i i i don't know i don't
[1:23:26] even know
[1:23:27] how i don't even know how to respond to
[1:23:29] the word let me tell you one good time
[1:23:31] you take a drink of this wine one good
[1:23:33] time you'll figure out how to raise your
[1:23:35] hands
[1:23:36] when somebody gets drunk everything gets
[1:23:38] loose and the volume gets louder
[1:23:42] what's happening down there i'm talking
[1:23:45] to a bunch of drunks
[1:23:46] that ain't drunk on new why they're
[1:23:48] drunk on the simulation of revelation
[1:23:50] of the word of the hour that will pack
[1:23:52] their bodies
[1:23:54] out of this world we weren't destined
[1:23:57] for this
[1:23:58] atmosphere we were destined for the
[1:24:00] atmosphere
[1:24:01] of the supernatural where the miraculous
[1:24:04] takes place
[1:24:06] [Applause]
[1:24:13] this is your world the rest of the world
[1:24:15] don't know nothing about it
[1:24:17] but you know all about it because there
[1:24:19] was a forerunner that went before you
[1:24:20] that has drawed you into the blessings
[1:24:22] of the holy spirit
[1:24:24] and if the holy spirit would walk in the
[1:24:26] form of jesus
[1:24:28] and he would take on the life of god
[1:24:30] when he was reconciling the world to
[1:24:32] himself
[1:24:33] and the lepers were made whole and the
[1:24:35] dead were raised and the blind could see
[1:24:37] and the sick were healed and last was
[1:24:39] being down in the bosom of abraham
[1:24:41] and he was visiting with the prophets
[1:24:43] and he heard a voice that
[1:24:45] lazarus come forth if the atmosphere
[1:24:48] of jesus was that great to pulling from
[1:24:51] that dimension
[1:24:52] to this dimension one of these mornings
[1:24:55] that
[1:24:55] same atmosphere will pack us from this
[1:24:58] dimension
[1:24:59] to that dimension an atmosphere of the
[1:25:02] holy ghost
[1:25:03] with five loaves and two fishes become
[1:25:06] blessed and feed five thousand
[1:25:07] an atmosphere where jesus walks on our
[1:25:10] water
[1:25:10] we're in atmosphere where storms are
[1:25:12] spoke out of existence
[1:25:14] when the dumb begin to speak the maimer
[1:25:16] made whole
[1:25:17] the lame to walk and even demons
[1:25:20] recognize his presence
[1:25:22] i tell you in the atmosphere of the holy
[1:25:24] ghost death can't kill jesus
[1:25:26] hell couldn't hold jesus the grave
[1:25:28] couldn't contain jesus
[1:25:30] but jesus didn't keep that power to
[1:25:32] himself he poured it out on the day of
[1:25:34] pentecost
[1:25:35] he poured it into 120 empty vessels and
[1:25:38] they come out of there
[1:25:40] speaking in tongues staggering under the
[1:25:42] atmosphere
[1:25:43] of the holy spirit that was spoken by
[1:25:46] joel
[1:25:46] that this is that what were they doing
[1:25:50] they were staggering
[1:25:51] under the atmosphere of the fulfillment
[1:25:53] of prophecy
[1:25:56] there's a lot of people that come into
[1:25:57] our ranks coming to these services and
[1:25:59] they don't understand everything that's
[1:26:01] going on here
[1:26:01] but we are under the atmosphere of
[1:26:03] fulfillment of prophecy
[1:26:05] that it's been told by malachi 4 that
[1:26:07] she'd be dressed in fine linen
[1:26:09] that she'd walk down the streets of gold
[1:26:11] that she would be spotless and blameless
[1:26:13] and holy
[1:26:14] you are under the atmosphere of malachi
[1:26:16] 4.
[1:26:18] i'm not ashamed of that i'm not ashamed
[1:26:21] of that
[1:26:21] because outside of this message there is
[1:26:23] no rapture
[1:26:25] [Applause]
[1:26:27] i know it's a little strong for some
[1:26:29] people that think they got the holy
[1:26:30] spirit but all they got is on their
[1:26:32] flesh
[1:26:32] and if it's just on your flesh he will
[1:26:34] not pack you over in the rapture
[1:26:36] but if you have come to the fulfillment
[1:26:40] of the word of this hour you cannot be
[1:26:43] left behind
[1:26:44] you will break into another world
[1:26:50] [Applause]
[1:26:52] you know what it's like you know what
[1:26:54] it's like
[1:26:55] opening a present you begin to break in
[1:26:59] there
[1:27:01] and joy begins to fill your heart
[1:27:04] because you don't
[1:27:05] really know what's inside of there
[1:27:09] it could be one of those new electric
[1:27:11] bikes where you don't have to pedal
[1:27:13] to get a workout but your read automator
[1:27:17] tells you you have went 12 miles
[1:27:20] and your watch says you're doing a great
[1:27:22] job take a breath
[1:27:28] but you know the difference somebody's
[1:27:31] pushing you
[1:27:34] now now you know the excitement of that
[1:27:36] breaking into that present
[1:27:38] but can you have the same excitement
[1:27:41] when you know what's already on the
[1:27:42] inside of there
[1:27:46] i want to tell you that if you will just
[1:27:48] let me just let me go on just for a
[1:27:50] moment here i ain't going to be too much
[1:27:51] longer because you're about to pull me
[1:27:52] to death
[1:27:53] but if you could just realize i want to
[1:27:55] tell you that there's a president before
[1:27:57] you but i want you to know that you can
[1:27:59] have the same
[1:28:00] excitement on this side of the present
[1:28:02] as you can on that side of the present
[1:28:04] and i want to tell you that the joys
[1:28:06] that are laying on that side of the
[1:28:07] present will not be able to be contained
[1:28:10] that god is going to pour out a blessing
[1:28:12] upon you that you will not be able to
[1:28:14] contain when you surrender yourself
[1:28:16] and when you break into this present
[1:28:18] you'll look on the other side of those
[1:28:19] seven seals
[1:28:20] with all the word that's been tied
[1:28:22] together and said this is your hour
[1:28:24] you understand the god here you
