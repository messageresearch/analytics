page to me but you're here and i ask god that you would extend your throne of mercy towards us lord you know the needs we have in our bodies and we just ask that you be mindful to us in jesus name amen amen if you have your bibles this morning we'd like to look over in the book of isaiah chapter 6 isaiah chapter 6 and then to john chapter 20. man isaiah chapter six this morning i'd like to speak to you this morning on breaking into another world hey man well i like that preacher myself well we won't bother won't bother maybe too many people but let's let's store up the devil's kingdom a little bit this morning isaiah chapter six and verse one you ready to have church oh i just love it i love it no church like full gospel lighthouse let me tell you that oh man if you can't preach from this pulpit you just can't preach i believe there's a spirit of liberty here in this church that i'll tell you we might as well we might as well just go ahead and thrash the devil this morning isaiah chapter 6 and verse 1. in the year that king uzziah died i saw also the lord sitting upon the throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple above it stood the seraphims each one had six wings with with twain he covered his face and with twain he covered his feet and with twenty did fly and one cried unto another and said holy holy holy is the lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory and the post of the door moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke then said i woe is me for i am undone because i am a man of unclean lips and i dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the king the lord of hosts then flew one of the seraphims unto me having a life coal in his hands which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar and he laid it upon my mouth and said lo this hath touched thy lips and that iniquity is taken away and thy sin purged also i heard the voice of the lord saying whom shall i send and who will go for us and then said ah here am i send me also john chapter 20 and verse 19 and as you're making your way there i'd like to read this quote to you this morning from hear ye him brother brown said he said you can take an egg that a hen is supposed to set on to hatch it and you put that egg in an incubator where it's just warm light that incubator will hatch the egg just the same as the chick or the hen will itself because it's the atmosphere that does the hatching it's the same thing in a meeting of this type it could be possible tonight and also probable it will be that there could be an hour of this next hour on that clock that there wouldn't be one center or backslider left in here without being right with god it could be that every sick an afflicted person could be made well and go out of here glorifying god this could break into a repeat of pentecost if the atmosphere gets right see the atmosphere to bring such results would be the holy spirit if he can get every heart in one accord john chapter 20 and verse 19 here jesus appears to his disciples and said the bible said then the same day at evening being the first day of the week when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the jews jesus came and stood in the midst and said unto them peace be unto you and when he had when he had so said he showed unto them his hands and said then were the disciples glad when they saw the lord then said jesus to them again peace be unto you as my father has sent me even so i send you may god bless his word you may be seated in the presence of the lord as we said we'd like to speak to you on breaking breaking into another world and as we we have read and we see the the vision that is caught up and it was it's even more than a vision that you see the scene that is put out before you in isaiah chapter six and and we know that the prophet would be so influenced to preach from this text of isaiah chapter six and especially from 1962 on down to 1963-64 you'll hear brother branham preaching on influence influence and of another influence of the angel and those things and here you're you're breaking into a scene that that that that that you're seeing where the king use i had had just been taken off the scene notice in john chapter 20 as we've just read that jesus this is after his resurrection and that he appears to his disciples and notice that jesus is breaking in into into their world and notice that jesus is the best at breaking and entering but when jesus breaks in there's nothing that is broken but everything is made whole and everything is kept the same except for the people that are in the room and notice that we're living in an hour when we have been told to come up hither we have been called out of the things of this world of laodicea to come out of her my people and notice what when we read over in revelations chapter 3 when we read about our church age about the conditions of the church age and you see the reward that is given that christ himself is standing at the door he's not standing at the door of every individual but here he is standing at the door of churches and churches have shut them out shut him out in this day they have shut him out by and they've bound him there by their creeds and dogmas and ideologies of humanity that they've came up with and they have kept jesus christ bound at the door but the church all they would have to do is open that door and christ would come in but there is a people on the earth today that christ has determined that they would be his chosen place of worship that he would come and dwell on the inside of them and he would be and he would birth them to be a real kingdom a real priestly and a godly people that god would come and he would determine that he would set himself on that people and god is taking a people of humanity and breaking them into a realm of divinity and he is taking them out past the realm of this human world and the senses of this world that we're living in and even though we don't see the pillar fire sometimes with our eyes yet he's here and yet he's moving and we realize that we're living in an hour of advancement and i think it's such an amazing thing that the bride of jesus christ is advancing like never before she's had this message for over 50 some years but now she knows exactly who she is she's advanced in the word she's matured in the word she has a right to preach she has a right to stand she has a right to worship because she's standing in the hour of advancement now we cannot get past our head but the body has got to follow but you find it amazing that every time that god does something the world also does something as well it's a spirit of the day that we're living in of all ages that there are twins throughout all things and if the bride is advancing the church is advancing and you'll see the church is advancing in members but all they want is a coffee shop and they want somebody to tickle their ears there's more people sitting outside the sanctuary than there is on in the inside of the sanctuary but the bride is the complete opposite she has made her way into the inner courts of the holies of holies and she is advancing when the pillar of fire comes down and condescends upon her she is advancing in the hour when the son of man is revealing himself like never before and you watch the advancements of science when everything the last hundred years that we've been living is the greatest time of the advancement of science because everything is moving higher everybody's trying to get bigger everybody's trying to get taller men of industry are building taller skyscrapers they're they're they're not satisfied with just this style this style or they want to do something different because man is in a state of unsatisfaction but there is a satisfaction to a soul of a real son and daughter of god but you realize that science is is setting records like never before they're coming out with with greater technology they're coming out with greater advancements and it's showing you the age that we're living in and i was listening to a tape the other day and brother random was speaking about humanity that even in its perverted and fallen state that you can look upon them and see them how they build such beautiful houses how they take and they they develop such beautiful things and there they are they're developing these things but yet they're in a fallen and perverted state and can create a mansion like we have here or our houses that we have it's an amazing thing but it is a type and a foreshadow that we're going to a mansion where we're not in a perverted state where we're not in a fallen state but we're going to a mansion and jesus said that in my father's house there are many mansions here we have no continuing city but we are going to a city hallelujah you see but science has always taken man forward they're always taking you forward into greater things and breaking into the mind what are they doing they're breaking in as the prophet would say into god's laboratory but notice what science does science is not looking back to what science said hundreds of years ago but they're advancing they're moving forward into something else notice it's a constant moving higher they're breaking in every single day they're breaking in and eating more off of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil but we're not looking back either we're not looking back to what wesley said we're not looking back to what luther said this is the eagle age when the eagle the flying eagle anointing is taking a bride higher into a realm that only she could tap into now wesley he was under the man age and those men were under that man age but they can never break into this world that you know about as great as men that came up there of finney and wigglesworth and all of those men in the man age they can never come up here where you're living at but there has been an anointing that has allowed you to break in to the world of faith that has allowed you to break into the world of the seven seals to show you that everything is open to you that you don't have to wonder about it everything is released to you and you are in a state of satisfaction knowing that this message will take you from this world and put you into that world when everybody is dissatisfied with where they're living at the bride of jesus christ is advancing in the satisfaction of the son of man hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah notice when when isaiah i noticed his influence brother branham it's amazing to me that he would tap into this and we'd bring these things out right under right under the ministry of the seven seals that he would say now isaiah and uzziah were chumps he said they were friends and he said isaiah would have his eyes upon uzziah he'd watched him and notice he said he said you watch the effects of that vision that happened to the prophet it caused him because he was watching a man and any time you get your eyes on a man it will cause you to fall it will cause you to fail but i love what god does that whenever humanity falls he quickly gets his prophet's eyes back on the source of life because isaiah stood there and he watched as josiah got out of his place and he tried to usurp authority in an office that he wasn't destined to be in and i believe it's a great lesson for every one of us to never get out of our office to never get out of our office of worship or office of praise or office a pastor or office of deacon we should always stay in that realm that god has destined us to be but because uzziah stepped into a realm that he wasn't supposed to be in god smote him with leprosy and he died right there but you see what god did he took isaiah just a little bit higher and he caught him up and brought him into a world to show him not yaziah's fault but he brought him up to a place where he would get his eyes upon the lord jesus christ and when he broke into that world he seen something that he never went and seen before he broke into a sphere no more than what he'd been looking at down here on earth but he broke into a sphere that allowed him to look at the real hero you know you got your own heroes down here on earth but those heroes will fail you if i am your hero i will fail you if a man of god if a man in his own human ward in in his own garb and his own in his own robe if that man is your hero that man will let you down are you with me but i want you to know if you have a hero in christ jesus he's not going to let you down he is the superman of the day hallelujah hallelujah but notice what did he do he took him into a world where he looked and he saw the lord he took him into that world so that he would see what was real and as we go on thinking about these things of breaking into another world brother branham was dealing with some doctors one time and he was he was looking he was looking into he was looking in he was you remember when brother branham was talking about he would speak about the tree of knowledge that the more man eats off of that tree of knowledge the more he destroys himself you remember one time brother branham was having a conversation with doctors about this that he was talking to them and telling them that the more man eats off of it he destroys himself if he he ate gun powder and he killed himself he ate he ate automobiles and he killed himself and he and he ate atomic bombs and the more he eats the more he destroys himself you remember the conversation that they were having and they they spoke to brother branham and said well now now mr branham now now even if those things weren't created man would still die but brother branham told him said now look he said if they would have never left the tree of life they would have never killed themself you see because because they only kept eating on the tree of knowledge and if you eat on the tree of knowledge and the tree of intellect it'll only take you so high i want you to know you can reason your way up so far but then it's got to come to a world of faith in the world the anointing keeps coming you can try to figure out how the pillar fire moves and you can try to reason it out how we preach a message how we preach a message that'll put you in a body change and in your own humanity you can't figure out how in the world this is going to happen but then you've got to break into another world that world of faith will show you that these things are to be are you with me it'll tell you that there is real leadership that'll put you in a rapture that this world is in our home but you see the more you climb up that tree of knowledge the more you destroy yourself and not you can only get so high on the tree of knowledge but if you ever get one time on the tree of life he'll allow you to keep climbing higher he won't put you down he won't kick you off but he'll lift you higher you ever been to those amusement parks and and they got this they got this ride they call it the drop zone if you ever been on anybody ever been on that thing i know there's a few people loving things but if you don't know what i'm talking about this thing's a tower and this tower will take you all the way up over top of the amusement park and you can see everything there is on the inside of that part you can look up there but it's only for a few seconds you might as well get ready because your feet's going past your head and your stomach's going up to your throat but you're able to look out across the land and look at it for just a few seconds and then they drop you like a bad habit but i want you to know that when god lifts you up and he is your high tower he don't drop you down he lifts you up so that the higher you get the more you see the closer you look the more you'll see that he is the great i am [Applause] you see it's beyond human reasoning that a person that would be diagnosed with cancer could live when the doctor said he's going to die after they said he's going to die a few seconds or a few months later it's beyond human reasoning that a man with cancer would be sitting in a service but the world of faith was broken to so that a man with conditions that were more than humanity has allowed to be setting in a building like this you see what it is it's a breaking in to a world of faith now it's just like a boy brother brandon would say like a boy that he said he said i can swim i can swim he said if he's standing there just flopping his hands on the water but he's still got his feet on the ground he ain't swimming but as soon as he drops or he jumps in then he begins to gurgle and then he begins to call for help that's the time that you gotta swim and when you get in trouble that's the time to realize that you were born to break into a world where everybody else can't swim like you but you are born to swim god if god put fins on a fish's back surely he can put sons and daughters in a place that they can come out of the world he didn't destined you to lay out us here he destroyed you to a bright age to live above laodicea not outside of laodicea above laodicea what's god looking for somebody that's willing somebody that's willing to to go beyond the humanity and notice what the bible said in romans 8 and 16 that the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of god now i could read that every day in my life matter of fact i do but you could read that and every single time it does something on the inside of my heart that his spirit beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of god and if children than heirs and heirs of god and joint heirs with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for i reckon does anybody reckon with me this morning i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth it waiteth it weighed us all creation is groaning for this one thing the manifestation of the sons of god and you are in the hour there's never been an hour like this hour when sons are operating in a world that only sons can operate in hallelujah the church world can't move here the church world can't preach here the church world can't live here but sons can this is the hour of the elect now notice notice i want you to know that that before there was a creation there was a creator now we're very uh very familiar that he is the same can he say amen to the word of god this morning that he is the same and that this god who is our god fills all time space and eternity that's what the bible teaches us is that right so we can look at it in this context that he is but he is not going and he is not coming he's here so follow me in my thinking so here he is he has created you and before you were he was he always is always was and will forever be so we realize that when we see him come down in services like we're having don't ever take these things for granted what you're seeing amongst you is a move of god and what you need to do is not jump off the train but jump on the train and stay right on here because you see god is moving you into a world that only the elect can be moved into and if you get off of this train you are only showing what class of people that you are when the prophet would preach three kinds of believers you will only show your colors if you jump off the train with judas and if you jump off the train with the seventy that could not walk of jesus but i'm like the disciples that stood there when jesus asked them will you also turn away they said lord where will we go for you only have the word of eternal life so on this train that we're living on or abiding in if i can say it like that it's a move of god and what you're witnessing is the dispensation of the holy spirit dispersing himself just like joel said that in the last days i will pour my spirit out upon all flesh now notice what is always being laying there in scripture now the prophecy was already laying there in joel chapter 2 he was laying there but now you are seeing the manifestation of the holy spirit so let me say this to you the things that you have asked for they were already in his department where he could give them to you before you ever ask so let me put it to you like this your miracle is already in the room [Applause] if you could just realize that you're in a moment if you could just look at this that you are in a moment of the miraculous and all you have to do is look past your senses look past what you feel look past what you see and break into a world of eternity that the miraculous is standing before you hallelujah if you realize that there are two omnipotents here the miraculous will take place i can tell you when he dropped that in my heart that your miracle's already in the room so before let me let me just get real plain right here before i see the evidence before i see the evidence of complete freedom from sugar diabetes it's the elephant in the room so let's just call it out before we see the evidence of cancer leaving i already know that the miracle's in the room before i see the evidence of a baby walking down the aisle the miracle's already in the room before i see the evidence of prodigals walking through the back door the miracle is in the room before i see my mother-in-law my father-in-law and all these brothers and sisters that i prayed for i can say it with authority that the one that creates the miracle is in the room and if he's in the room nothing's going to stay the same and if he's in the room miracles got to happen deliverance has got to happen salvation has got to happen oh i tell you there's an acts 2 38 pouring out of the baptism of the holy ghost i can tell you you can try to stop me from preaching this but i got baptized into this preaching i got baptized into this thinking i got baptized into this so i can't get out of it i'm already in the water your miracle is in the room [Applause] hallelujah so the holy ghost was always the holy ghost the pillar fire was always the pillar of fire the cloud was always a cloud and before it let me put it to you like this it might be a little hard for some of you to understand it but let me put it to you in the form of predestination moses was always moses let me say it to you again ron spencer was always ron spencer katie spencer was always katy spencer it may not look like a son and a daughter of god at one point but by the predestination of god you were as the son before the foundation of the world and if you are a son you can operate as a heart you ain't changing you ain't wavering god ain't waiting he knows where you're at whether moses was on a mountain or whether he was in the valley moses was moses and before then he got in trouble then he was denny mike was mike jeff was jeff howden was out and i am i'm not changing i am a son of god oh let's break into a world that satan don't want us him but you can't keep us out of it where'd you get that material right from the bible if it's a bible teaching i'm going to teach the bible if it's a bible doctrine i'm going to preach a bible doctrine [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah we look not at the things which are seen but the things which are not seen what was it that jesus was looking at he was looking into another world when he was beginning to speak to nathanael and he said before philip called you i knew you i saw you when you were sitting underneath that tree and he began to speak to him he said when notice how me rabbi he said before philip called you i saw you when you were sitting there now what was jesus doing he was going back in his past now no matter what nathaniel's past was he was telling him of his future and he began to tell him he said because i said these things they'll believe us and say that i am the son of god he said but shortly you will see the angels of god ascending and descending upon the son of man what was he doing god was taking him into higher hatch he was taking him to deeper depths and the son of man was looking past what he saw oh you sat here in your condition you said here in your affirmatives you sat here in your sickness but i want to tell you the son of man's looking past he said well i'm not going all the way let me tell you he's looking past your own your own fears to go all the way there's a lot of people that are sitting on a fence if there is a fence there ain't a fence there's no neutral ground but there's a lot of people say well i'm gonna just stay close enough in case noah is a good man he'll let me in this ain't how this works but there's some people that are sitting on that fence of unbeliever make believer and believer i have chosen in whom's class i will be in i will be with david i will be with daniel i will be with noah i will be moses i will be with jesus i will be with wesley i will be with william branham i will be with the bride of the last day i have chosen the class that i am in so i've got to live in the class that i choose to be what is it it's a stepping in to another sphere if you're living in a spot of justification if you're living at that spot you can look back into another world that you just came out of just come out of a sinful world now you're in a spot of justification but if you're in a spot of sanctification you can look back into the world that you came out of a justification but if you are in the baptism of the holy ghost in the stature of a full son of god you can look back into another sphere that you came out of and if you i've not come far enough just keep walking just keep walking i reminded when the prophet said one of these days he said you just keep walking you just keep walking and before long you'll get so light that you can just walk up on in the rapture oh you can get caught up in the world you're in or you can break into another one there's another world for me there's another life for me there's another destination for me and it ain't hawaii it's a place a land that is there's flowing milk and honey it's a land of the holy ghost it's a land where the lamb is the light hallelujah and we're seeing him more evident before our eyes that this is him if i told you that i saw the pillar firing here about 10 minutes ago would you believe me so if i tell you that you know i'm not telling you that by my own human emotions i'm telling you that because he allowed me to see him what is that that's the manifestation of him because he always comes behind his word now whether i see him or whether i don't i know that he's there well how can you know that brother answer he said where two or three are gathered in my name there i'll be in the midst of them so whether i see him whether i feel him whether i don't but if he shows me himself it's only to vindicate that the preaching of the word is right on the mark this is your hour this is your moment this is your visitation this is the hour let me tell you you get on a plane and you're ready to get off at atlanta are you ready to get off over over in california what do you do you grab your bags and you get off the plane because that's the spot that you're looking for now let me tell you if you're looking out the terminal and it doesn't say gate b12 or revelations three or revelations 21 22 then you need to stay on a plane a little bit longer but if you're on the plane and you look out there and you've met your destination you can grab your bags you can walk off knowing that you have made it to where you were going and i ain't gonna stop walking i ain't gonna stop packing these bags of the holy ghost until everybody's on the plane with me but before you ride you gotta have a token my goodness my goodness yeah i'll tell you what this it's a little bit bigger than me this morning it's breaking into another world you remember when brother branham was up here on that mountain he got up here praising god that little squirrel was down there chattering he looked up there and he figured out why that squirrel was chattering he got to looking up there and there was an eagle up there there was an ego up there and he said he began at talking eagle said you know i could shoot you in a matter of seconds he said even though i wouldn't have he said but i could shoot you and he said that thing wasn't scared of me he said because he knew that he could set his wings into an atmosphere and be gone in a matter of seconds and if you could ever set your wings into an atmosphere of the holy ghost you won't worry about the chatter of the squirrels that are down there on the ground because the squirrels ain't going to get to you when you go up there let me tell you you can let laodicea criticize you you can let them make fun of you little make fun of this holy ghost but just set your wings to the atmosphere of the holy ghost it'll take you into another world that you don't know nothing about it'll put you into a body change that the prophet told me that i was going to be a part of and i believe that the atmosphere is here of the holy spirit that the miraculous can be done when the atmosphere is said that we will break into another pentecost just like in acts 2. he says well i ain't never received the holy ghost you can have it he said well i never spoke in tongues you don't have to speak in tongues i have the holy ghost but if you pray long enough you'll speak in tongues let me tell you you say well i i've never danced before let me tell you one good time let me tell you give one time you're either going to love everybody when you get drunk or you're going to dance or you could fight we say well i i i don't know i don't even know how i don't even know how to respond to the word let me tell you one good time you take a drink of this wine one good time you'll figure out how to raise your hands when somebody gets drunk everything gets loose and the volume gets louder what's happening down there i'm talking to a bunch of drunks that ain't drunk on new why they're drunk on the simulation of revelation of the word of the hour that will pack their bodies out of this world we weren't destined for this atmosphere we were destined for the atmosphere of the supernatural where the miraculous takes place [Applause] this is your world the rest of the world don't know nothing about it but you know all about it because there was a forerunner that went before you that has drawed you into the blessings of the holy spirit and if the holy spirit would walk in the form of jesus and he would take on the life of god when he was reconciling the world to himself and the lepers were made whole and the dead were raised and the blind could see and the sick were healed and last was being down in the bosom of abraham and he was visiting with the prophets and he heard a voice that lazarus come forth if the atmosphere of jesus was that great to pulling from that dimension to this dimension one of these mornings that same atmosphere will pack us from this dimension to that dimension an atmosphere of the holy ghost with five loaves and two fishes become blessed and feed five thousand an atmosphere where jesus walks on our water we're in atmosphere where storms are spoke out of existence when the dumb begin to speak the maimer made whole the lame to walk and even demons recognize his presence i tell you in the atmosphere of the holy ghost death can't kill jesus hell couldn't hold jesus the grave couldn't contain jesus but jesus didn't keep that power to himself he poured it out on the day of pentecost he poured it into 120 empty vessels and they come out of there speaking in tongues staggering under the atmosphere of the holy spirit that was spoken by joel that this is that what were they doing they were staggering under the atmosphere of the fulfillment of prophecy there's a lot of people that come into our ranks coming to these services and they don't understand everything that's going on here but we are under the atmosphere of fulfillment of prophecy that it's been told by malachi 4 that she'd be dressed in fine linen that she'd walk down the streets of gold that she would be spotless and blameless and holy you are under the atmosphere of malachi 4. i'm not ashamed of that i'm not ashamed of that because outside of this message there is no rapture [Applause] i know it's a little strong for some people that think they got the holy spirit but all they got is on their flesh and if it's just on your flesh he will not pack you over in the rapture but if you have come to the fulfillment of the word of this hour you cannot be left behind you will break into another world [Applause] you know what it's like you know what it's like opening a present you begin to break in there and joy begins to fill your heart because you don't really know what's inside of there it could be one of those new electric bikes where you don't have to pedal to get a workout but your read automator tells you you have went 12 miles and your watch says you're doing a great job take a breath but you know the difference somebody's pushing you now now you know the excitement of that breaking into that present but can you have the same excitement when you know what's already on the inside of there i want to tell you that if you will just let me just let me go on just for a moment here i ain't going to be too much longer because you're about to pull me to death but if you could just realize i want to tell you that there's a president before you but i want you to know that you can have the same excitement on this side of the present as you can on that side of the present and i want to tell you that the joys that are laying on that side of the present will not be able to be contained that god is going to pour out a blessing upon you that you will not be able to contain when you surrender yourself and when you break into this present you'll look on the other side of those seven seals with all the word that's been tied together and said this is your hour you understand the god here you understand the serpenty you understand who you are you don't have spiritual amnesia i'm taking you to a spot that i destined for my bride and my bride alone look on the other side you're already there my loved one is there my family's there and i'm

on there the atmosphere is set for the body change [Applause] i i tell you i just don't i don't know what else he could do for us i don't know how much greater it's going to get down here i don't know how much darker it's going to get down there and lay i'll see you but i know up here we're living in the light of the day i honestly i don't know how he could go higher every weekend but he does but he does what was last weekend it was just a step to get higher to this weekend and what is this what is this weekend a step to get higher and one of these days we're going to take our final step he's
