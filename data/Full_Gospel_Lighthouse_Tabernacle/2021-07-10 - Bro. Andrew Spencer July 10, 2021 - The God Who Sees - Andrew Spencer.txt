jesus oh jesus there's just something about that man there's just something about the name of jesus when you go to speak in it all fear leaves when you begin to speak the most holy name there is hallelujah we certainly want to be speaking the name of jesus christ over sister karen pruitt just now and she's in desperate need of a of a touch from the lord and i believe i believe god's more than able when and we don't know what is we don't know what his plan is but we just know that that we're in it and at nine o'clock our time tonight brother tim and brother timothy are headed to the hospital to pray for sister karen lay hands on her and so uh at that time if if we're out of service by that time or in service we'll just we're just going to join with them in prayer we're praying we've been praying all week been praying over this whole situation and this is not this is no surprise to god and i'm just thankful to be in his his plan in this all and that's the consolation that we take in times like this is knowing that he's got it and uh i certainly enjoyed that song that the uh that the hills and the shiplets thing this evening and i can tell you about a jesus that that heals from from somebody that was brain dead and he's our pastor so nothing's nothing's too hard for our god there's nothing too impossible and we just believe for the impossible and when things come against us like this we we just hold on we hold on to those promises and and so we we're going to do the same in this moment right now we're going to hold on hold on until the storm is over you know we we bring much consolation or gather much consolation from the thought that that here this pulpit a few weeks ago that that god said i i'm coming down to deliver and and you know we just know that he's that he's come and he and what a peace that that brings a comfort knowing that god has come down to deliver amen amen maybe we just sing that song his eyes on the sparrow i know the enemy is real upset so we just want to set an atmosphere i believe it's already set but even to control my my own emotions just now i want to yield completely to the lord and ask for a touch for sister karen for the body of jesus christ also brother tim just now that the lord would minister through him i believe that there is power in human vessels and when the bible said that they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover i believe he was referring to us i believe brother tim is a real general of this army a real god called man and we've seen god work through him and i have said this to him and across the world if if you're in bad if you're in bad case in a bad situation and brother tim goes to praying god moves we don't know how he'll move but we know he'll move so let's just sing his song his eyes on the sparrow this evening i'm happy [Music] and i see [Music] because [Music] [Music] is [Applause] [Music] me so i [Music] oh so i see [Music] because i'm happy oh i see [Music] because i'm free [Music] the space [Music] amen what a powerful thought to know that god is watching if you have your bibles this evening we'd like to look in the book of genesis chapter 1 and also down to genesis chapter 16 and verse 6 this evening and in the book of genesis if you don't know where it's at it's at the beginning of the book so we'll start out at the book at the beginning so it's not too hard for you to find i'm just trying to settle myself i'd like to speak to you tonight on i'd like to speak to you tonight on the god who sees the god who sees the bible says here in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters and god said let there be light and there was light and god saw the light that it was good and god divided the light from the darkness as you're turning to genesis chapter 16. brother branham would draw a context a lot of times and would bring it to our attention that that before there could be a materialization there had to be a word and before there was a word it had to be a thought and what god has spoken will be no matter what the promise is god sees his promise and god is obligated to it genesis chapter 16 and verse 6. but abram said unto sarah behold thy maid is in thy hand to do [Music] is in thy hand do to her as it pleaseth thee and when sarah dealt hardly with her she fled from her face now just to just to bring it to your mind and to understand where we're going through the scripture you remember that this was the woman because of because of sarah's impatience this is the woman that was that was chosen and brought in to bring forth life because she said god hath restrained my wound but notice when she begins to begins to when the seed begins to grab a hold of sarah begins to get very roth but notice in verse 7 the bible said and the angel of the lord found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness by the fountain in the way of sure which is on the way to egypt and he said hagar sarah's maid once came as thou and wence wither will thou go and she said i flee from the face of my mistress sarah and the angel the lord said unto her return to thy mistress and submit thyself under her hands and the angel the lord said unto her i will multiply thy seed exceedingly that it shall not be numbered for multitude and the angel lord said unto her behold thou art with child and shall bear a son i shall call his name ishmael because the lord hath heard thy affliction and he will be a wild man and his hand will be against every man and every man's hand against him and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren and she called the name of the lord that spake unto her thou god sees me for she said have i also here looked after him that seeth me wherefore the well was called beer lahore behold it is between qadesh and beret let's just speak to the author of the word father we know that you are very near just now and we know that when you come it is to vindicate your promise and lord we are very aware that before there can be authority it has to be traced back to the author father we have traced back this authority of the word of god all the way back to see that you are the author of the promises and we stand here as your children knowing that we have all power in heaven when it was placed in us with a seed of the germ of god and that you did not keep that power to yourself but you placed it in human vessels that emptied out themselves that they might be the temple of the most high god father we're very aware that you are seeing through us tonight lord we're reminded that in this day we have seen you stand and read the very thoughts and intents of the heart of your children and lord i'd ask just now that that you would read lord not just our lives but i pray that you would speak to us about our future and i ask lord for the needs of the body just now that you would minister supernaturally to them father the spot that sister karen is in is a spot that only you can bring her out of now father we know that you're a healer and we know that you're a waymaker we know that you're a promise keeper lord and we stand firmly upon the authority of the word of god that you're the same yesterday today and forever and lord we just ask as your children you have heard our petitions we've laid them before your feet and we ask lord that you would see these things we've not brought them before a weak god we have brought them before the almighty el shaddai the breasted one that we can draw from lord i pray that you would give strength to the weak just now and i pray father that as the word goes forth may you speak to your children speak individually live to ear to us as we know that you're passing by this way in the name of jesus christ we pray these things amen amen may god bless you this evening we'd like we just like to we'd like to just say that god is here and as i said we'd like to speak to you on the god who sees and i personally have never ever taken a text along this way and when god began to deal with my heart early this week about this subject i i felt so pushed to to go this way and i don't really know and i don't even understand all things but i believe that he's in it and i believe that that one of the greatest things that everyone setting here amongst us little children old that the thing that we're taught of probably one of the most powerful themes that we were taught or the principle themes that we were taught as children is that god sees us and before we just the just the ability as a child as soon as that child is able to or has the cognitive skills or the ability to be able to retain we as parents begin to tell our children that god sees and that god watches over us and what a consolation that that is to know that there is nothing that's coming and there's nothing that is going or nothing in our future that god cannot see he he's seen us through our trials he sees us before we ever get to them and you remember when brother branham would talk about that eagle up there on that mountain how that how that she was how that she was up there and she had taken her eaglets down into that little valley down there and and and she was watching them and she went way up onto the upon the mountain and she was looking down in the valley and he said if a coyote would take after those little eaglets they would have mother eagle on their hands to deal with and to think that if that if a mother or eagle would have that kind of instinct that was that was placed in her by god almighty how much more should should we trust in the promises of god knowing that that god is an omnipotent god and that and that god is omniscient he knows all things he he understands all things he has a universal knowledge of of all things he sees all things he is the omniscient god and and in the masterpiece brother branham said that the omniscient he is omniscient which makes him omnipresent and he knows all things but in order to be a being he has to be in one being by being omniscient he can be omnipresent because he knows all things and knowed it before he know before the world began how many fleas lice how many bugs and how many times they bat their eyes and everything about it because he's omnipresent because you can't be omniscient or omniscient without being infinite and there's one thing infinite and that's god and you see we can rest assure knowing that god knows all things can he say amen to the word of god this evening and knowing that he is in control of all things and i believe that the god of all the prophets is still right here amongst us and i believe that that same pillar of fire that that led the children of israel that that was ever seeing and knowing what they were going to have to go through before they ever went through it is still here i believe that the god of elijah is still here and he still heals he still heals both bodies soul and spirit i believe that he's a full gospel man i believe that he's full of power i believe that he is the omnipotent the god of all power i believe that he is the omniscient the god all-knowing and i believe that makes him omnipresent the same yesterday today and forever and just before god declared that in the scripture that he is the same yesterday today and forever he declared it in hebrews 13 and 5 that i will never leave you and i will never forsake you and i don't believe it's just a little elementary thought for children tonight but i believe that it's a great thought that even though we we've been become scholars in the message but to know that the eyes of the lord are upon his children and just to think about that to to know that that the god that wrote the bible is the god that is going to see you through the promises and and i can make you a promise tonight and i could try to take you all the way through that but to know that the all-knowing god that knows what you're gonna get through and go through and be going through in the future and in the present through the promise because the promise was before you got in trouble and the promise is after you got in trouble and he is jehovah shama the lord that is already there before you ever got in trouble he is already there david said be he said if i make my bed in the hail thou art there if i climb to the heavens thou art there you're not getting past god tonight you can't you can't get past his greatness you can't understand how wonderful he is but it is my objective in this life to lift him up so high that when i lift him up as high as i can go that there is still no way that we can reach how great he is but to know that the god of the bible has said that i have seen you it doesn't matter how insignificant you feel or how unimportant you feel god is wanting to tell you that i'm seeing you and the bible would teach us and we as parents or i remember when my parents and my grandparents would take me and set me up on their knee and they would tell us that the eyes of the lord are watching over you now sometimes as parents you use that as a fear tactic to know that to make them know that god is watching over you you'll be careful little feet where you go for the father up above is looking down in love but we know that the bible teaches us that in proverbs 15 and 3 that the eyes of the lord are in every place beholding the evil and the good also in second chronicles in 16 for the eyes of the lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him and to think that the eyes of the lord are running over this land and looking out upon the situations of laodicea and if there's one thing that i would say god is watching what's going on in congress god is watching what's going on in our in our school systems god is watching what's happening in your homes and to think that the eyes of the lord the eyes of the lord are are watching over you through every situation and you might think how in the world are we going to get through this layout of seeing age and wonder how we're going to get through and pass the pass through these things and overcome every sickness and overcome every temptation don't you worry god is going to see you through and to think that the eyes of god are watching you because the if you go to studying out the eye the eye of humanity it is one of the most incredible studies that that that science has even done today i i said in i sat in a in a doctor's office one time and he began to he began to look into my eyes and then he began to take pictures and different things and he was showing me what the eye looked like and all the different nerves and everything and he was showing my personal eye and he was saying that he said he said because you don't have these things in there he said it proves that you have a healthy eye and as i was looking there i looked at him i said well that right there is proof to me that there's a god that created us you see when you go to begin to look at the eye that god is the creator of all things and and that would shut down every big bang theory there is that the god that created all of the cells that go into the eye when you go to looking at the eye there are things that are called cone cells and there's about seven million of those cone cells that are designated in the central spot of the retina that is designed to be able to show forth a a sharp vision and bring out the bring out things and transport it into your brain to say that that is an image you see psych impacts the most and imparts the most vivid and extensive knowledge you see if you were a blind person and i would tell you certain details about characteristics of somebody you wouldn't be able to understand like seeing because when you see something just at a quick glance your mind is able to grab things and your memories able to hold on to it and it builds a more definitive thing in your mind than any description ever can and i begin to think about this about this fault and i begin to think what the attack that brother ron has went through and i'm sorry for for bringing up and i'm not making heirs or trying to make something out of out of brother ron's sickness but i believe that that god allows us to look look at at trials that we go through and gather and garner spiritual warfare and garner things we garner things from job we garner things from abraham and as i begin to look at this fight that brother on has been on throughout this journey and you remember when he when he lost his vision and his in his peripherals there and i was there i was there when he told me he said get me to the doctor he said i'm he said he said i'm not going to work i'm not going to work today i got to get to a doctor now that right there is proof to me that brother ron ain't feeling good because brother rod is not a lazy human being but notice notice what the enemy did he came in and he shut off the vision he shut off the vision so that he couldn't see but it was a telltale sign that something was wrong and i began to think about that how that that satan didn't want just to attack his lungs but he wanted to attack his eyesight and shut off the vision and that's the same thing that that has happened in this day is that that satan has come in and tried to shut off the vision of the church so that she can't see and that she can't operate in the realm that she was destined to operate in but there is an eagle eye anointing that has come down in this day that can lift her out of this laodicean flu and take her into the heavenlies in which she was destined to actually you remember that that was the thing that that that the that they they came against and attacked brother branham against was the first thing was those visions that he was having is that they were attacking him over those things and even dr roy davis said now bro he said billy you need to leave those things alone he said it's it's demons it's demon spirits that are causing those things it ain't nothing but the devil you remember brother branham said he said i don't want to be wrong in these things i want to be right i want to be right i want to be right before god and he was there at his home placing there god came and he dealt with him and come down in a whirlwind beside his little house there and he told his wife meter said now i'm not coming back i'm going up there to that cave and i'm not coming back until i got an answer from god on these things and you remember what happened because here he was told that these visions were of the devil and then about two or three o'clock in the morning there stepped a man out of a light and told him of his peculiar birth he told him what these visions were that you were born a prophet that you were born into this age and you are born to pray for the sick and he said if you can get the people to believe you nothing will stand before your prayer not even cancer you see god saw that there was going to be a people that would believe against all art and i believe that there's a people still here on earth that believe that god is ministering through angels in this day and he's ministered to a seventh angel and here we are a recipient of the message of the seventh angel that will change our mortal bodies you say well i don't understand that and i can't see it god does hallelujah you see not only does god god not only seize us but he sees through us and knows us all together the god that we serve isn't an impersonal god or a god that has lost interest in you but god is faithful when he gives a description of himself in the last church age he said these are the true sayings or he says this that this is the faithful and true witness you see god is faithful to see you through things god is faithful to take you all the way through and knowing that he is going to lead us where the grace of god is going to keep us the bible tells us in jeremiah 12 and 3 but the lo though thou o lord knowest me thou hast seen me and tried my heart towards thee psalms 33 and 18 behold the eye of the lord is upon them that fear him upon them that hope in his mercy psalms 34 and 15 the eyes of the lord are upon the righteous and his ears upon their cry the face of the lord is against them that do evil to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth job 36-7 says that he withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous and to think that tonight that god is not taking his eye off of you are you with me before you ever went through your trial god had his eye on you and he's not planning on turning his eye off of you hallelujah what a consolation that gives us as the children of god that we know that god has not taken his eye off of us he's not took his eye off of sister karen he's not took his eye off a brother on he's not took his eye off of our lost loved ones god is not withdrawing his eye from the righteous hallelujah you see our life is spent beneath the eye of god and every part of his dominion in all the worlds that he's formed his never closing eye is present and his creative power is felt you remember in life magazine when when the the the picture of the of the cloud was put in there i believe it was may 17 1963 you notice that he he had his he had his picture put in life he didn't have his picture put in time because you can't stop life but he noticed how that how that the how brother branham would tell us about that he would look at that cloud and he would look at those things and and there he was looking at it and the angel of the lord told him said turn it to the right and if you look at that and you begin to look at it it's exactly the hoffman's head of christ and what is it when you look at that you see that christ is looking down upon the earth what is he saying to you god is looking over this last day bride to make sure you're going to make it through you have been through some battles you have been through some wars you had to come out of denominations you had to come out of every stigma every kind of complex you had to come out of every bit of formalism intellectualism all kinds of ideas that was against you but god is showing you in a magazine called life and shown it to a world that god is looking over you and to think to know tonight that almighty god the god of creation the god that is the author and the finisher of our faith his eye is upon you [Applause] you're his bride and he will get you through it and if you know that his eyes are upon you you can look at isaiah 41 and 10 and say fear thou not for i am with thee be not dismayed for i am thy god i will strengthen thee yea i will help thee yea i will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness knowing that his eye is upon us the promise of god says in 40 isaiah 49 and 15 can a woman forget her suckling child that she should not have compassion on the sun of her womb yea they may forget but i will not forget thee behold i have graven thee upon the palms of my hand thy walls are continually before me as paul said i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god god has his eye on you uh when i was when i was up in ohio a few weeks ago brother ray erickson shared shared a story with me that it happened to brother wayne while he was preaching and brother wayne was was going along with a thought and he was he was going and he had some scriptures in his note and he and he thought well i'll just pass over them and when he had that thought that i'll just pass over them there came a light that came and hung over that scripture and he said well i can't pass over that well when that light came there was a woman sitting back there that seen that light come and hang over that situation and hang over that scripture and it was exactly what they needed in that moment you see god is mindful of all that you're going through you may not see the pillar of fire you may not see the angel of the lord but i want to assure you tonight that he is here he is in the building he is watching over your situation and that you may look and think well i'm the most worst sinner in the city jesus don't care what condition you're in you might show up naked and god will put clothes on you you see when he looked over there and the bible said in john chapter 5 i believe that the that the legion the man that was possessed with demons when he saw jesus here's a man that was the very first streaker that we know about come running to jesus but jesus does not leave him in that condition because his eye what's the words his children and he said that i will clothe thee and they reset in his right mind hallelujah what is it god don't care where you're at but he does care where you're going [Music] notice what the bible said in psalms 121-8 the lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth and forever more now the greeks say that god is all i that god is all i that he is all seeing and it's not the feeble and changing glance of fickle humanity but it is the pure and perfect eye of the eternal god that even like daniel said when he was speaking to the king over in daniel chapter 5 and 23 he said when when the king had brought in the vessels from the temple of the lord and he brought them to his own party and daniel spoke in this god and whose hand our breath is you see you see god's got you sinner or saved lost or found god sees you now i personally am not acquainted with any thieves but i have never heard of any thief doing a or committing a felony in front of a police officer or some judicial officer of of the justice i've never heard of anybody committing a felony like that knowing that they were being watched you'd have to be a dumb thief to do so i'm sure there's some people out there that don't because they want to go get a free meal but yet man can come in and break the very law of god knowing that he is the all-seeing god they can come in and they can sure they can steal away your joy they can steal away your prayer life praying for them but yet they'll break the very law of god by sin and unbelief knowing that god is the all-seeing god but i want you to know tonight that god isn't just watching you to see if you fall he's not watching you just to find your wrongdoings he's not watching you just just as hey prove that hey i'm a god of judgment but god is watching over you god is watching over you to make sure that you get out of that trap that the enemy set for you he's watching you to make sure that no harm comes to you he's watching you to make sure that you come to full maturity in the word of god he's watching you because you're hiss and i want to say to you he cares for you do you care for him i'll let that sink in just for a moment he sees when man don't see he understands what man don't understand and he's got angels that are watching over you i said little spencer boys and spencer family that was one of the songs we knew i just couldn't learn up singing he said god's got angels watching over us and you know we believe that that god has angels that are set to watch over us and and we know that through the message and through the bible that that minor angels they're they're watching over us and every one of us has a guardian angel and according to the scripture even jesus said he said now he said don't you hurt one of these little ones he said because their angels they their angels behold my father's face which is in heaven so we realize that everyone sitting here young or old has an angel that is watching over them and brother branham would say that that that that afflicted children or or people with needs have a special angel that's watching over them and the bible tells us in psalms 34 and 7 that the angel of the lord encampeth round about them that fear him and delivereth them now notice i want you to find this this is such an amazing thing that that the angel is not coming and the angel's not going but the angel's actually camping out at your house the angel's camping out when the enemy comes in like a like a like a lion and he's trying to destroy you there's an angel already camping out about you i want i want to say this to satan you better watch out god's got his eye on you i want to say this to satan loud and clear god has his eye on you and you better run before it's too late god will catch you god will destroy you you can torment us all you want to you can try to build us build us into a in a falsehood or you can try to tear us down but the almighty seeing god looks past our sin looks past our traps look past our mistakes the all-seeing god has got his angels and camped about us to know tonight that the angel of the lord was camping about sister denise before she fell off of a ladder before brother ron fell off a ladder and broke 44 40 vertebrae in his back god had an angel that was there he will give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways he said my angel in exodus 23 and 20. he said my angel have i sent before thee that he might bring you into a place that i have prepared and we believe that there are angels that are appearing to god's children and they are his messengers and servants of the almighty god and if you go to studying out angels and you go to studying and looking how angels move and how they operate those angels will actually influence things here on this earth god has angels and he's watching over us now the very first time that we ever see the angel of the lord in the bible it's directly after abraham receives his call from the lord but notice who the angel comes to for the very first time a woman by the name of hagar and actually if you go to studying the bible you'll find that that the angel appears to hagar twice now notice what he says and i i found this so amazing that the angel of the lord he speaks to hagar and he said he calls her by her name he he found her by a whale found her on her way back to egypt but he calls to her and he says hagar sarah's made whence cometh thou and where are you going now when i began to look at that scripture i heard an angel in this day come and tell people their name tell them their position in life tell them their address now who was doing that none other than the angel of the lord are you with me now look here's this woman and we know that that hagar is a type of the law how that she represents the stalk which is the first life but here and we find out when you go to studying out history that that you'll see that the bible says in genesis 16 that that hagar was a bondwoman that that that she was an egyptian and so we know and by history we're taught that hagar was picked up when abraham and sarah had went down to egypt and here hagar is going to produce an ishmaelite and it's all because of sarah's impatience and because she said that the lord has restrained me from barren he said go and she tells abraham and starts putting this thing on abraham you go down there you go down to you go until i say hey guard my maid that you might obtain children by her and when this seed starts taking life sarah kicks hagar out because hagar starts producing what she can't i know it's going to get a little bit sticky right here on this thought but i want you to know there's a people a lot of people that i kick you out because you're producing what they can't amen there's a lot of people who write you off in life because you're producing a holy ghost that they can't produce you see if they would ever get where the gospel really is they would actually produce what abraham seed is and if you go to looking at what hagar is hagar is a woman that is basically a slave and here she is a woman in distress a woman that is carried away by chance running through the desert she's rejected she's unwanted she's kicked out and she's going to bring forth a son that's hated by everybody and everybody he's going to hate everybody everybody's hands going to be upon him and his hand's going to be upon them here's a woman that's kicked out ain't good enough for the society that she was brought into here's a woman that was unseen by most amen wandering for the desert unseen but god saw her but god saw her and to look at these scriptures and know that god paid special attention to her and because of the angel's speech to her she acknowledges that that god is over human affairs and he is guiding it by divine government and notice what hagar does she calls god's name she grabs an attribute of who god is and she names him hell rui the god who sees me the god who sees me you can try to hide but there's no hiding place and you might be wandering through a desert but the lord is coming by the well and he's wanted to have a conversation with you you may you may feel like you have been abused you may have feel like you've been kicked out and you might be going through a period when you may feel like no one else sees you when no one else understands what you're going through no one can feel for you you might be an elderly person and you might feel unimportant or insignificant you might feel all alone because your partner in life died some years ago you might feel rejected you might feel shut up and you might feel unseen but god is saying to you i have seen you i have seen you you were unwanted by the promised one you were unwarranted by somebody that's going to bring forth the promised son but i've got my eye on you i begin to think about this i thought god i'm beginning to think about this god what i know what hagar is i understand what she represents i understand that that she represents the bondwoman that she that the bible says to cast out the bondwoman she's not part she's not a part of the free that i understand that she represents the stalk which is the first sign of life that she couldn't go on and carry the life all the way i recognize that hagar was somebody was somebody that received seed and produced an israelite and i thought my god why are you telling me this why are you having me look on this one thought it was because god wanted to produce somebody that would catch the inspiration and manifest that i am the god that sees if you'd only realize one thing that hagar is the only one that ever calls him the god that sees somebody that was unwanted somebody that was locked up in a whole lot of sin in a spot when her master had abused the situation because sarah but here god was going to prove to an unwanted little girl she was in a land that she did not know but god says i have seen you oh little bride you're in a land that you don't know nothing of but god is saying to you you will produce the promised seed i'm looking over you i see you i see you through battles of cancer i see you through battles of depression i see you through anxiety i see you when the doctor went wanting to give you a prescription to fill up your prescription i see that i see when the money is running out i see when the groceries are not in the refrigerator i see when the comforter cupboard is empty but i want you know god knows how to walk up to a house and put grocery bags on your front parts and you would realize that this is him he sees when you're full and he sees when you're empty he's a god he's a god that though you may not have the holy ghost and though you may not be in the plan of full redemption but god sees you i still believe that god saves the lost i still believe that everybody maybe everybody can't be bride but oh god let me preach that i can live such a life preach such a sermon that the lost would find their way through the cross of calvary it ain't popular it ain't popular to preach about the blood it ain't popular to teach about the cross because the cross is not something beautiful but the cross is a rugged cross air on that cross when jesus was struggling for life he was struggling to catch his own breath they had nailed his feet and they nailed his hands and when jesus would try to lift himself up off of the cross to catch a breath in his lungs he'd raise himself up and every time he'd raise himself up he'd have splinters that were piercing through his skin but his eye was on you brother jerry his eye was on you when he was climbing up calvary what is that thump thump thump that i hear it's the cross going up gal gotha's hill what's that blood trail what's that blood dripping down from that tree this is more than just some ordinary blood this is not just the man the blood of man or the blood of jew or the blood of gentile this is the blood of the almighty god god is able to look and he's able to see all things he can see you in your troubles he can see you when you fall and he sees you when you get back up he can see you through your sickness he can see you through your worry but there's only one thing that god cannot see and that's on the other side of the blood hallelujah the god that is the infinite god that knows all things holds all time space and eternity in his hands he cannot see on the other side of the blood if you be the son of god deliver us take us off of this cross where are you at where you see yourself at the father when you enter in to paradise remember me remember me this day he didn't have a chance to get baptized he didn't have a chance to to know all the teachings that jesus taught but this day this was the last man that would ever enter paradise because god was going to close it up once and for all he was the quickest one in and the quickest one out oh god would you remember me oh lord jesus you see he is omniscient he has never had a new thought about anything because all his thoughts he all has always had always will have and he knows the end from the beginning because he is god thus the thoughts of god are eternal they are real they are not simply like a man with a blueprint he has drawn up and which one day will be translated into substance and form but they are already real and eternal and a part of god don't you know that brother random said that if you ever were in his mind you'll always be there now notice in the sumerian church this is where it's coming from he said see how this works god always had his thoughts for adam adam has his thoughts what but was yet unexpressed and he goes and he grabs psalms 139 and 14 and he says i will praise thee for i am fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous are thy works that my soul knoweth right well my substance was not hid from me when i was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth thine eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect i was not yet completed and in thy book all my members were written and which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them how precious also are thy thoughts unto me o god how great is the sum of them you were in his mind you were in his thoughts when you were just a little baby before you ever got your mother god thought of you this shuts down every idea that you can point at and say god is okay with abortion because he knew david's members before he was yet perfect he ain't just killing some unborn baby you're killing life those thoughts are already real [Applause] they're already real before they ever get here before the vision ever speaks it was real before jesus ever fell and bumped his little knee he was already there i think about myself right here before i was born the doctors told my mom and dad that there's going to be something mentally wrong with him i know a lot of you already think yeah but they told us tonight some going to be mentally off and they they they didn't use the word but they were saying that i was going to be slow or or in a state of retardation and they told us they told them that just to be aware of those things now what if what if what if in this day that we live in if somebody would have shut me out what if what if they would have said what if somebody what what if what if mom would have said hey you know what i'm not going to produce that i don't want to bring forth a child that's middle and i don't want to bring forth a child that's going to struggle socially and i don't have to worry about him not being able to talk right stuttering all kinds of different things what if what if you just shut down life what if but god saw me let's just say you shut it off you to shut down every young person that i preached to you to shut down every victory that we had in this church you to shut down every breakthrough you to shut down every person that i led to christ what if they may have said i was going to be something wrong with me but god said he's going to be just the way i formed him to be he's going to be wiry he's going to be uncontrollable but he's going to preach my message and when he preaches my message there's going to be somebody that's going to have a victory there's going to be somebody that realizes they can have the overcoming power of the almighty god when he preaches souls will be saved where was you job when i formed the foundation of the world where was you when the morning starts sang for joy and the sons of god shouted for joy i was in his mind and if i was on his mind i was on his mind at calvary i was on his mind in the rapture i'm on his mind you're not too insignificant your needs not too small he's a great big god but that's what makes him god to me is that it can come from the highest down to the lowest god's got long-range vision you look like you are never going to walk but he saw you walking you thought that you'd never be able to live this message you thought well i i'm not gonna have nothing to do with that but god saw differently i'll never sit there and listen to that guy preach i know what he did in his past but god come by your way and he showed you mercy he showed you how great his grace is hey let me tell you if there's anybody unworthy i've never won but i'm reminded that a prophet said that when the weakest of christians goes on their knees hell trembles you might feel unwanted you might feel cast out but that's the kind of people that god is looking for somebody that is insignificant somebody that's a nobody that he can make us somebody god is chosing the ignorant and the unlearned he didn't choose the high and mindy he didn't choose the scholars of the day but he came to us a bunch of poor peasants a bunch of fishermen didn't even know how to sign their name but they had enough gump when a man that laid there by the beautiful gate he said look upon us for silver and gold have i none but such as i have give i thee in the name of jesus christ they weren't looking on the flesh they were looking on a promise and you might be in that condition laid there for all those years but i want you to look on somebody that's bigger than your problem [Applause] hagar had some issues she had a whole thing a whole line of things stacked up against her i'm gonna produce somebody that nobody wants around but god says i see you i want you to notice the grace and the sovereignty of god the angel of the lord comes to hagar twice you flip over in genesis chapter 21 and you can go and read it later but here sarah seen that hagar was mocking it was not her time it was not her time in genesis 16. it was her time to turn back and to submit but here it come time after isaac was born and hagar was mocking and sarah said cast out the bond moment for she's not a part of the free and abraham the bible said that abraham was concerned because it was his son and you find that you go looking over in there i believe it's 14 through 19 that you find that hagar gets to a spot when the waters done ran out and the bread that she was carrying on her shoulder had done ceased and this little baby was crying and the bible said that she put him cast him underneath of a tree under a shade tree and she went off about the distance of a bow shot and the bible said hagar i have heard the crying of your child where are you he found her at a well one time and he put a well where she was this time and brother branham he goes in there and he finds it he said that god god didn't come to her god was coming to that seed he said because he was abraham's seed the angel came now i know this is just a little bit sticky for you but the reason he comes to you is because there's a power of a seed laying there you may not know what it's going to produce you might get caught up in the idea well i don't know i don't know what's going i come out of all kinds of conditions but i want you to know god ain't looking at you he's looking at that seed he ain't looking at the cancer he's looking at the seed he ain't looking at brain bleeds he's looking at the seed he's not looking at your troubles he's looking at the promise when samson would get in trouble all he had to do was know that god was looking down from heaven and he could see the promise of those seven locks hanging over top of his shoulders and the anointing of god would come over samson and he would destroy the philistines but one day they cut it off but what they didn't realize it was growing back pentecost tried to chop off your hair they tried to put pants on your sisters they tried to cut down your your power of the holy ghost but it's beginning to grow back and once more let your spirit fall lord jesus let me destroy the enemy that has plans for my future may you see me through my victory hallelujah you see the word is god's looking glass that reflects what he is and what you are it tells you this is the only book in the world that tells you where you come from and where you are and where you're going this is god's looking glass that shows what he is and what you are my brother said he said but in between there is a bloodline that shows you what you can be if you want to make that choice my brother jason jackson sent me this sent me this thought or sent me this quote this evening i'd like to share it with you brother brown's dealing with the patient he says it's nervousness he said the only thing sir you think deep you cross bridges before you get to them taking other things upon your heart and you're always planning something that never happens it's it's only mental nervousness it's a mental nervousness that's right you've been that way for years but jesus christ is here to take it off of you he said there's a dark shadow follows you all the time you're conscious that there's something near you like that at that at all times but don't you believe that god's going to take it from you now he begins to pray satan leave this man come out of him in the name of jesus christ go out of the man i adore thee by the living god that you torment him no more raise up your hand sir you're free for the first time since you was a child go on your road rejoicing for the very first time in all your life there come a man by your way and say you're free you're free you're free because god saw it god saw that thing you've been dealing with god saw that torment that you've been put through in the night season but god says go when you're fro on your road rejoicing you're free man i'll tell you what you can look through at the bible and you can find a whole lot you can find a whole lot of people that was just like you they was unwanted that the society didn't want to see those people they chose not to see them but he healed the lepers when they didn't want to be around them they'd say get away from us but jesus said be thou clean you know sometimes as humanity you run into situations or you run into people that that you just you just don't you feel awkward around you try to avoid them because you don't really you don't really don't like them but you don't know how to speak to them in that situation you don't you don't know how to you you just feel awkward around them but jesus don't feel awkward around you he healed the lepers he healed the blind he delivered the demon possessed he had a conversation at a well with hagar he had a conversation at a well with a samaritan woman that was unwanted had to go in the heat of the day i don't know why i'm preaching to you like this but this was a woman that was unwanted but god chooses to see the ones that are unseen you might be the quietest person in this building you might be the person that that seems you just want to be you just want it you don't want to be in the forefront you don't want to be seen you just want to be there but god sees you god sees you you know the bible even jesus would talk about he said isn't too sparis sold for a father and he said but he said he said but how much more he said i know i have numbered the hairs on your head and he said how much more of a great value are you than the sparrows he said i know every one of them have falls to the ground i know them all he counts the stars one and all and he names them how much more valuable are you now notice notice i i'm coming to a close he said but did you ever get up in the morning and hear all those robins hotline oh you got to get up early to do that all the little birds just as soon as it breaks day we we corrals all around all night and can't get up till about one o'clock on sunday even go to church but sit around and they they stick as they stick his little heads through the air and sing and sing and sing he said he never heard of one of them ever having high blood pressure you never did see one on a crutch did you he said because god takes care of him that's right they just trust that and commit everything to god and go ahead now i i've studied nightingales and i noticed some nights when the storm clouds was coming over he'd quiet down and then all at once he'd let out loose again just sing to the top of his voice and i thought i wonder what does that now science tells us that they look upon the heavens and if they can't see any stars or any light they they get sad and they don't so they don't sing but if he can get his eye on one star he knows the sun is shining somewhere so he knows it'll break day after a while so he just sings to the top of his voice and i thought oh god that's right if i can get amongst some people who's got it and you can squish that can you can squeak out a little amen out once in a while and let me know that the power of the holy ghost still exists somewhere that's right if that little bird could get his eye upon the stars and realize that i am singing to the creator of life how much more if we are of great value how much more should we be able to echo out on amen god i know you've seen me i know you know what i'm going through i know you know what what i'm facing god i want to praise you there was a woman by that that was a widow down his airpath that elijah had had been fed by the ravens but god went down there and told him said he said you go up there there's a widow that i have commanded to feed thee i want to say to you that god sees something in you that you don't even see in yourself you see when she when he got up there she was looking at two sticks and she was looking at the bottom of a barrel and she was looking at a cruise that was empty and all but god seen something else he said he said go in there give me some water he said and fix me a cake first she said she said as i so live it i'm fixing this for me and my son and we're going to die he said but no you go in there and you fix me one first and then you fix it for your son and yourself you see god saw something that she didn't see she saw an empty barrel but god saw a barrel that would not waste and he saw a cruise that would not dry up god sees something on the inside of you you've been fighting this thing looking at this thing and you're trying to figure out what's going on but god sees something on the inside of you that you don't even see about yourself you might be a hagar wondering where in the world's god at but god has come down to say that i see you god's looking for heroes he's looking for people that'll stand out and believe him god's looking for men today that will move when the spirit moves he's looking for character he ain't looking for membership but he's looking for somebody who would take the sword of the word somebody that's not afraid and i'm gonna close on this song that don't be afraid but god be for you who can be against you he's looking for somebody that'll move when the spirit moves and if i leave you with one thought i want to leave you with this thought the things that are laying in you you may not see them but god does [Music] the things that are that are laying there before the foundation of the world you may not see but other people around you see it and my where i'm grabbing that from so you know is first samuel 16. here's a boy that's doesn't want his brothers don't want him around here's a boy that's ruddy insignificant 12 year old looks like a shepherd smells like a shepherd don't look like a warrior don't smell like a warrior don't know how to use don't know how to use the weapons of warfare he didn't even realize what was laying there though he'd been anointed he didn't realize what was laying there and you may not realize what's laying there but it's laying there and i want to tell you that laying on the inside of you is a giant killer is a serpent bruiser laying on the inside of you is a god that is a waymaker laying on the inside of you is a predestinated seed that will take you all the way over laying on the inside of you is something that you cannot see you cannot feel but you know how to worship god and because you know how to worship god you start sowing that seed that's been sown you start watering it and you start praising it and somebody recognizes hey that god knows how to drive out evil spirits let's bring him into the king's camp and let him play some music before saul it's got to be somebody that knows how to do it right david didn't realize what was said about him but there was somebody that was close to saul and said there's a man he is a great man of valor he's a valiant man he's a warrior he's a warrior and he is pleasant on the heart there was something laying on the inside of david that somebody else saw oh hallelujah there is something laying on the inside of the blood of jesus christ that will drive away every evil spirit that will drive away every cancer when you don't see it you're a mighty man when you don't see it you're a mighty woman when you don't feel it you're a son of god when you don't know it you're a daughter of god [Music] where did he find you at he found you by a well you thought that you come looking for god but god came looking for you because jesus said i got a need to go by samaria where hagar's at where hagar's at is also cadesh barnea where the greatest battle was ever fought on the earth at that time was happening what was god doing he was preparing a well he was preparing a well and there's a whole lot of people that told you you can't get them there's a whole lot of people i told you that the land of the holy ghost wasn't for you there's a whole lot of people that told you that you're not you're not welcome over there in that land it's too big for you it's too many giants over there for you but there's something laying on the inside of you joshua we're more than able to overcome it we're more than able to take it there's a god that stood by this well and told us that we were wanted there's a god that tells us he's going to see us over into the promised land he's going to see us through jericho he's he's going to see us when we get rahab out he's going to see us when aiken falls and 34 men die he's going to see us through it's our land we're not wanted there but it's our land they were in a land where they were wanted but you're going to a land where you are wanted you're going to a place that's prepared for you picked out for you designed for you god's got a promise hanging over you church [Music] in the land of unwanted to the land of the wanted [Applause] oh somebody give god praise in the house of god hallelujah hallelujah god saw all the way down here in this darkest of ages in laodicea when nobody else would serve him when nobody else would worship him but because there's a people that god saw under the auspices of the message of the seventh angel she will be a final voice to the final age because god saw her [Applause] what is it those seven spirits of god those eyes he was looking through a seer and there was a prophet said stay in line little bride stay in line little bride i got my eye on you and i heard a voice said get back in line get back in line and she got back in you may have stepped out but now god is saying to you get back in watch out devil watch out devil god's looking amen how many can identify how many can identify i was unwanted i was ridiculed i was made fun of they told me my dance wasn't good enough they did but you know what i did i just danced even harder they told me i couldn't carry a tune in a bucket so i went to somebody that knew how to carry one and i started singing they told me well he'll never be able to preach [Laughter] ain't going nobody want him in their pulpits oh but i'm still standing i've heard a whole lot of critics come against me all my life but i'm still here and they're not here i'm still standing i'm still preaching i'm still singing i'm still dancing i'm still shouting when the world ain't got nothing to shout about i got everything in the world to shout about if you knew like i knew what it done for me unwanted it ridiculed alone made fun of but god says i see you as the musicians come brother barron said he was there
