[39:29] heard before I don't search for new
[39:32] things if it ain't in the word message
[39:35] of the hour you're not getting it
[39:38] so in the beginning was the word and the
[39:41] Word was with God and the Word was God
[39:44] those are some of the most profound
[39:46] words that you will ever hear in the
[39:47] Bible amen beginning was the word the
[39:51] word was with God and the Word was God
[39:54] he was in the world and the world jumped
[39:57] down number 10 he was in the world and
[39:59] the world was made by him and the world
[40:01] knew him not he came into his own his
[40:03] own received him not but as many as
[40:07] received him to them he gave power to
[40:09] become the sons of God even to them that
[40:11] believe on his
[40:14] name which were which were born not of
[40:16] blood nor of the will of the flesh nor
[40:19] by the will of man but of God these were
[40:21] born of God and you'll see we'll get
[40:24] into that later on the meaning of that
[40:27] and the word was made flesh I want to
[40:30] bring out the the thing that we're going
[40:31] to title after was the word was made
[40:34] flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld
[40:37] his glory in the glory as the only
[40:39] begotten of the father full of grace and
[40:43] truth let's bow our
[40:46] heads Heavenly Father how wonderful it
[40:48] is Lord to sit around your word Lord we
[40:52] believe we're in the last days we
[40:54] believe we're at the door father and and
[40:55] every time that we can come together
[40:57] father to send under your word to get us
[40:59] that extra push Lord to make it through
[41:02] that door to take a Rapture Lord we know
[41:04] that this the the the bride already has
[41:07] the wedding dress on she has already
[41:09] been called Miss Jesus Christ Lord but
[41:11] we're coming in we com in on Saturdays
[41:13] and Sundays and Wednesdays Lord and we
[41:16] come in so that we could tighten that
[41:17] dress up make sure every lace is tied

[41:40] as a magnifying glass as it were father
[41:42] to to check our lives out so tonight
[41:44] father as you the put the magnifying
[41:47] glass of your word over us tonight
[41:48] father if you would see anything that is
[41:51] not there your Prophet said we will
[41:52] leave either better or worse there's not
[41:54] one person here Lord that will stay the
[41:56] same in this service tonight they will
[41:59] either receive or reject so Lord we pray
[42:02] that your spirit would come anoint those
[42:04] to receive what they have need of Father
[42:06] there's nothing I can do father for them
[42:08] Lord there's so many needs we heard the
[42:09] prayer requests Lord we know the needs
[42:11] of our our brother Ron we know the needs
[42:13] father we know it's a finished work in
[42:15] your hand but Lord there's nothing that
[42:17] we can do father within ourselves
[42:19] because these are things that you've
[42:20] allowed upon us for some reason you said
[42:23] just trust and believe father there's
[42:25] nothing that I can give them only that
[42:27] the promise father that you said it was
[42:29] in your word we believe in you for it
[42:31] Bless the people Lord get me out of the
[42:33] way father there's nothing I can do I
[42:35] can read these words on these notes read
[42:37] these scriptures father and unless you
[42:38] come that's all they'll be so we invite
[42:41] you Lord we welcome you Lord this is
[42:43] your time our time no longer matters
[42:45] right now this belongs to you in Jesus
[42:48] name amen you can be
[42:54] seated in John 1:14 it it says the word
[42:58] was made flesh that word made means to
[43:03] become so we're talking about God
[43:06] becoming so the title that I have
[43:09] tonight and this is something I've had
[43:10] this for
[43:11] months Lord and it's a song I heard
[43:15] heard a song what called the song was
[43:17] called I am becoming and so this really
[43:20] just sat on my heart for a long time and
[43:23] then you know I put down notes and then
[43:25] all this week every day this week just
[43:26] about I've been putting notes down this
[43:28] things that the Lord's given me and the
[43:30] title is are you becoming amen God had
[43:34] to go through a
[43:35] process God had to put himself through a
[43:38] process to become flesh he didn't have
[43:42] to you know we we we we look at this it
[43:45] said made to become to to come into
[43:47] being to happen to be made to be done
[43:51] Marvin Vincent translates this as the
[43:54] meaning of that that Greek word to means
[43:57] Co come into being manifestation
[43:59] implying motion movement or growth that
[44:02] is used for God's actions as emerging
[44:05] from
[44:06] eternity and becoming in time physical
[44:10] space that's right amen so we know
[44:14] through the the message of Malachi 4
[44:16] that we were told that in the beginning
[44:18] God was was not even God there was no
[44:21] one to worship him right I I I read it
[44:24] in another place just today that brother
[44:27] bam said there wasn't a God he wasn't
[44:30] God right he was alone yeah you know
[44:34] when I got to studying this and and I
[44:36] when when I got to studying this I
[44:37] thought you know what look at what God
[44:40] put himself through right yeah look what
[44:43] he put himself through that's right this
[44:45] is God becoming right and if God expects
[44:48] himself to go into the process of
[44:51] becoming why would he not expect that
[44:54] from us yes sir come on so we look at
[44:56] what God put himself through to
[44:58] condescend right God condescend so you
[45:00] could become Eternal right you could be
[45:04] lifted up he went to the lowest of lows
[45:07] so you could go to the highest of
[45:10] highs so we see God in his
[45:13] creation and he creates a man in his own
[45:16] image we brother brandom tells us and
[45:17] the scripture tells us that that that
[45:19] image was
[45:21] spirit that was God's image was spirit
[45:23] and then he created from the dust of the
[45:25] earth he created man he created Adam
[45:28] yeah but this is what this is not what
[45:30] God wanted for
[45:32] himself amen this was just a start of
[45:35] the process right you know looking at at
[45:38] at this and you know what well I'll hold
[45:40] off on that I'll get to it in a minute
[45:42] and brother BR says in Investments God
[45:44] coming down to become man to die God
[45:46] could not die as a spirit so he had to
[45:49] create a man he had to create a type we
[45:51] know Adam was a type amen God could not
[45:55] die as a spirit he could not die he's
[45:57] Eternal God could make himself in such
[46:00] the way as he could feel pain this is
[46:02] God becoming that's right he could make
[46:05] himself so he could he could feel and
[46:07] suffer God could not suffer as the
[46:09] eternal spirit but when he became man he
[46:12] could suffer right yes sir you'll notice
[46:15] I I wash the clock a lot because I'm not
[46:17] a long speaker
[46:19] here when he became man he could suffer
[46:21] and feel the pain and The Temptations
[46:23] that man went through like Adam and Eve
[46:26] in the Garden in everyone's sense he had
[46:29] to become
[46:31] that he had to become suffering he had
[46:35] to become pain right he had to become
[46:37] everything you
[46:40] feel what pushed God to do this come on
[46:44] now what would push
[46:46] God to make him desire to go through
[46:51] suffering this is the desire of God yes
[46:55] sir he had to become that to fulfill his
[46:59] own law that's
[47:01] right to take upon himself his own law
[47:04] good that's right he knew you couldn't
[47:06] live the law that's right you you
[47:08] couldn't live the law that's right come
[47:10] on so God took the law upon himself he
[47:13] beat himself with his own law
[47:19] Lord he could not have been the third
[47:22] person he could not have been the second
[47:24] person he could have been nothing else
[47:27] but the person right in other words he
[47:30] couldn't put somebody else in his place
[47:33] that's right Adam couldn't took his
[47:35] place that's right come on and don't let
[47:37] just stumble you mezc couldn't take his
[47:44] place you know we see God take this plan
[47:47] that he's
[47:48] got and it looks
[47:50] perfect everything is in order right we
[47:53] look at the Garden the the animals are
[47:56] getting along the The Lion and the the
[47:59] the lamb and everything and everything
[48:00] is
[48:02] peace and it looks like God has created
[48:04] something
[48:07] perfect but then something happened that
[48:10] God must have forgot
[48:11] about somebody snun in and God didn't
[48:14] know about it come on come on God's plan
[48:18] fell apart and he didn't know why come
[48:20] on
[48:22] right God knew what he was doing that's
[48:25] right God knew that this was going to
[48:27] fall
[48:28] apart you know when I was studying this
[48:30] I got to thinking one day but Andrew why
[48:32] why couldn't God just created Jesus
[48:35] Christ right
[48:36] then why couldn't God
[48:39] speak the very sales that he spoke into
[48:42] Mary that's right yeah the very sales
[48:46] why couldn't he done that in the
[48:47] beginning when he spoke life into the
[48:51] garden why couldn't Perfection come
[48:54] right off the bat right you and I could
[48:57] have been spoken word people living in
[49:01] Perfection you realize if God had
[49:04] allowed you and me to be spoken
[49:07] word we would have never known the real
[49:11] true God thank you Lord we would have
[49:14] never known who he was we would have
[49:16] never known that he's a savior we would
[49:18] have never known that he's a Healer we
[49:20] would have never known that he
[49:24] delivers but there's something in God
[49:26] God that had a desire to show that and
[49:29] he was willing to let everything he had
[49:31] fall
[49:33] apart he was willing to just let it all
[49:35] here Satan you're going to have it good
[49:38] cuz I got a greater
[49:41] plan when you get that moment you think
[49:43] God has forgot
[49:45] you when he said let there be you were
[49:49] in his
[49:50] mind you've been there ever since and
[49:53] you've never left right he had a perfect
[49:56] picture of you amen a perfect picture of
[50:00] you and it's never left his mind that
[50:02] perfect picture of you is what gave him
[50:05] the desire to let everything
[50:08] fall right amen he knew that was the
[50:10] only way that you and him would come
[50:13] together I got to let everything
[50:15] fall because they're going to need a
[50:17] savior they're going to need a redeemer
[50:19] they're going to need a
[50:23] Healer so it looks like God plan is
[50:26] falling apart but God's falling apart
[50:29] plan fell right into his
[50:37] plan you think God would you what do you
[50:40] think God was thinking when he's sitting
[50:41] there watching
[50:43] this you know he's had this what brother
[50:45] Brenham called a
[50:48] conference brother Bram said he had a
[50:49] conference there in the garden under the
[50:51] tree with Adam and Eve and The
[50:54] Serpent and he tells the serpent
[50:57] her seed will bruise your head that's
[51:00] what you're doing when you
[51:01] overcome that's you you are her seed
[51:05] when you overcome you're bruising his
[51:06] head amen yes sir that was part of God's
[51:09] plan that's right so God you know I
[51:12] wondering what God is watching all of
[51:14] this is he's he's watching Adam leave
[51:16] the
[51:17] garden Adam died that day Adam and Eve
[51:21] died that
[51:23] day you
[51:25] know is the the Bible tells us in case
[51:27] you're wondering about that statement
[51:29] I'm sure most of you know I know who
[51:31] your pastor and your preachers are but
[51:33] to God is a thousand years and from that
[51:35] day you know who knows how many millions
[51:37] of years Adam and Eve
[51:39] lived until then amen so when God says
[51:44] the day you eat thereof that day you
[51:46] die and they no longer live past that
[51:50] time so he had to watch this fall apart
[51:54] he had to watch sin after
[51:57] sin come upon his
[52:00] creation people he
[52:02] loved when you look at you you look at
[52:05] the people through the Bible how Noah
[52:08] and Moses and David and Solomon and all
[52:10] that how sin crept into their lives
[52:13] David being the apple of God's eye and
[52:15] God had to watch the the one that he
[52:17] loved in his mind that he was perfect
[52:20] and he had to watch him become an
[52:22] adulterer had to watch him become a
[52:24] murderer he had to watch
[52:27] worship gods that that were not him put
[52:30] up graven images in all these creation
[52:32] after him started worshiping things and
[52:34] given praise That was supposed to go to
[52:36] God
[52:38] right and God had to watch
[52:41] that year after year and thousands of
[52:44] years and thousands of years and God is
[52:45] watching his plan fall all to pieces but
[52:49] God is becoming right oh yeah God says
[52:52] my becoming is not done yet right it's
[52:55] not finished
[52:58] when Christ came and Christ died on the
[53:00] cross God's becoming wasn't done right
[53:02] it wasn't finished at Calvary come on I
[53:06] don't want to jump ahead there sorry
[53:07] about
[53:11] that this was God's
[53:14] creating in order for him to understand
[53:19] how you feel the Bible says he was as
[53:21] tempted in all things he went through
[53:22] all things that that any of us could go
[53:25] through but he had to become you God had
[53:28] to become you the prophet tells us that
[53:30] that he became you so you could become
[53:32] him by
[53:35] Christ in John 1 and12 as it says but as
[53:39] many received
[53:42] him gave them power to become sons of
[53:45] God it did not say that he just made
[53:47] them sons of
[53:49] God it didn't say he made them sons of
[53:53] God he gave them power to become sons of
[53:56] God you have that power in you brother
[53:59] brandham said when God all the power
[54:01] that God had he said you look at all the
[54:04] planets all the stars and the millions
[54:06] and light years beyond that and the
[54:08] galaxies beyond that and God created it
[54:11] with one
[54:12] word he said that same power is in
[54:16] you the same power that God had when he
[54:19] said let there be he put in you this is
[54:22] God
[54:24] becoming God is giving his power
[54:27] he gave him power to be sons of whe
[54:29] there's people that have power sons of
[54:31] God that probably got that seed in them
[54:33] they don't know it yet you didn't know
[54:34] it yet you had power from the the minute
[54:37] you took your breath of life if you're a
[54:39] SE son and daughter of God and you are
[54:41] about predestinated bride of Christ when
[54:44] you took your first breath the power
[54:46] that God had to create was put in
[54:49] you that was God becoming
[54:54] right but as many has received him to
[54:57] them he gave power to become the sons of
[54:58] God even to them that believe on his
[55:01] name that believe on his name that's a
[55:04] simple as that it ain't what you
[55:06] sacrifice it ain't it ain't how many
[55:08] hell marries you say it ain't it ain't
[55:10] the works that you do you got people
[55:13] searching after works and all this I got
[55:14] to do this I got to do that I got to you
[55:16] got to have signs I got to have this
[55:18] they're chasing signs and wonders signs
[55:20] and wonders are supposed to be following
[55:23] you they they belong to you yes you
[55:26] should have them on a
[55:28] leash you shouldn't be hunting them down
[55:30] and chasing them down you already have
[55:31] them that comes with the power that he
[55:34] put in
[55:38] you but God wanted you to have his
[55:42] nature you couldn't
[55:45] become what God wanted you to become you
[55:47] couldn't become without his nature
[55:50] right that's what how Satan has has done
[55:53] denominations and I'll bring it home
[55:56] that's how he's done in the message now
[55:58] come on now you got people becoming
[56:00] without his power that's right so they
[56:03] can't become they're becoming their own
[56:05] thing right Amen brother brand said
[56:07] there's only two Spirits at work two not
[56:09] three there's not you God and Satan but
[56:12] brother Bram said there's only two
[56:13] Spirits at work it's God or the devil
[56:15] it's either of God or it's of the devil
[56:18] so you got people becoming something
[56:21] else that's not God that's right push
[56:23] play is not becoming of God that's right
[56:27] God does not work in that way that's
[56:28] right God works in a five-fold ministry
[56:31] that's right that tells you about the
[56:33] power that you have in
[56:37] you but we've got to the the place in in
[56:40] our own message in our own ranks that
[56:42] people are they're coming up with their
[56:43] own thing we don't need the prophet no
[56:45] more you're either on this side that you
[56:47] you got to have only the prophet or
[56:49] you're on this side you don't need
[56:53] him there there's no becoming right
[56:56] you're in a ditch either way that's
[56:59] right you're in a ditch either way right
[57:02] that ain't in there I don't know where
[57:03] that's from or we but that ain't in
[57:05] there but so there's a process of
[57:09] becoming that's right so everything God
[57:12] had done up to now and the future that
[57:15] was in his mind before the foundation of
[57:17] the world had you in mind that's right
[57:20] amen Hebrews chapter 6 brother Bram said
[57:23] he become kin folks
[57:26] that he might rise you up raise you up
[57:30] before he could raise you up he has to
[57:32] give you eternal
[57:34] life that's part of you becoming and the
[57:37] deal about it is we try to become
[57:39] ourselves he says he'll do it for you
[57:42] right this is him giving you the power
[57:45] this is him raising you up before he
[57:48] could give you that power he has to
[57:49] raise you up that's right cuz what what
[57:52] are we we're born in sin saved in
[57:53] iniquity came into the world speaking
[57:54] Lies We didn't even know that power
[57:55] existed
[57:57] we didn't even some of us probably
[57:58] didn't even know there was a God right
[58:02] right part of God's plan was not that
[58:05] you know who he was from the minute that
[58:07] you took your
[58:10] breath amen there's some things in your
[58:12] life you'd probably rather not
[58:14] remember I there's a lot of things in my
[58:16] life i' I'd rather not
[58:19] remember but God says part of your
[58:21] becoming is I'll take that
[58:23] out I'll I'll deliver you of that back
[58:27] you don't have to live with that and
[58:29] Satan tried to beat you down with that
[58:32] with your past I I I preached a message
[58:34] some several months ago or last year the
[58:37] bride making herself ready and you know
[58:40] it came to me while I was putting this
[58:41] together that Satan tells you so many
[58:44] times because we know what the wedding
[58:46] dress is the wedding dress is the word
[58:49] right Satan tells you your past tells
[58:52] you your past tells you you'll never put
[58:54] that wedding dress on
[58:56] you won't fit it you've got too much
[58:59] baggage in your life you got too many
[59:00] things in your life that you can't get
[59:02] rid of you got too many besetting sins
[59:04] in your life you'll never get this word
[59:06] on there's people that think they have
[59:08] to get their life right before they even
[59:11] come to the
[59:12] altar they think they have to get their
[59:14] life right before they give the heart to
[59:17] God I can't come to God like this that's
[59:19] the way God wants you to come to him you
[59:22] can't take it off
[59:23] yourself part of the becoming process
[59:26] is laying there and letting God do it
[59:28] for
[59:29] you you can't take your sins off you
[59:32] can't take anything off of
[59:37] yourself that's God's grace to you it
[59:42] says Grace like we said earlier you
[59:43] couldn't live the law the law tells you
[59:46] if you do this you die that's right if
[59:48] you do this you die it don't matter
[59:50] you're going to die anything you do by
[59:52] law you're going to die if we had to
[59:54] live by the letter of the law
[59:58] and God pass judgment on us right now
[1:00:01] who in here would still be
[1:00:03] left be an empty church it'd be
[1:00:07] empty but here come
[1:00:10] Grace here come Grace you don't realize
[1:00:12] how much God wanted to give you Grace
[1:00:15] that is one of the main ingredients in
[1:00:16] you becoming is Grace without God's
[1:00:18] grace it'll never happen it will never
[1:00:21] happen so one of the ingredients of of
[1:00:24] becoming his grace you know I got to
[1:00:26] y'all know who Philip's Craig and Dean
[1:00:28] is and many years ago they wrote this
[1:00:31] song called Mercy came
[1:00:33] running I don't know why I'm going this
[1:00:38] way so I like I like to know how people
[1:00:41] got certain songs that's right
[1:00:44] amen and you know they're all three
[1:00:47] pastors good Christian guys for what I
[1:00:49] understand one guy said he he wrote this
[1:00:51] song said he was sitting in
[1:00:54] church and he was in church and he was
[1:00:56] listening to the preacher talk about
[1:01:00] mercy and he said Mercy was there all
[1:01:06] along you was living in
[1:01:08] sin you were so dirty right you know
[1:01:12] when you look at the big spectrum of
[1:01:14] things when you look at brother brandom
[1:01:16] said all our sins was was dumped on
[1:01:19] Jesus God left him in the garden hey I'm
[1:01:22] taking a tangent I'm known for him so
[1:01:24] bear with me
[1:01:26] Jesus is in the garden brother brandom
[1:01:28] said God left him in the garden because
[1:01:31] no sin your sin was getting ready to be
[1:01:32] put on him and no sin will touch a holy
[1:01:34] God right so God leaves him in the
[1:01:38] garden you think when I sit and
[1:01:42] think all that I've
[1:01:46] done and he was
[1:01:48] willing to take some of the foul things
[1:01:51] that I done brother Andrew thank you
[1:01:54] Lord Lord put on me father let me have
[1:01:59] it
[1:02:02] everything bad filthy
[1:02:06] foul that you've done in your
[1:02:10] life God smeared it into
[1:02:13] him pushed it into
[1:02:17] him all the while this is Mercy he said
[1:02:20] Mercy was put so hard against that Veil
[1:02:25] trying to push out screaming to get to
[1:02:28] you thank you this was the process of
[1:02:33] God becoming
[1:02:36] Redeemer and this is the process of you
[1:02:39] becoming
[1:02:41] God thank you
[1:02:43] Lord Lord and you had nothing to do with
[1:02:48] it you had zero to do with
[1:02:51] it you sat the whole bench in the whole
[1:02:54] game and they they gave you the
[1:02:58] trophy you got the MVP and you didn't
[1:03:01] play it down come
[1:03:04] on it's like you see these guys get
[1:03:06] these championship rings Super Bowl
[1:03:09] championship
[1:03:11] rings Lord let the Steelers get
[1:03:17] oneid you realize the guys that put the
[1:03:19] stickers on the helmet gets
[1:03:21] one the guy that puts the stickers on
[1:03:24] the helmet gets a super B ring come on
[1:03:26] bu come on and he might be sick with the
[1:03:28] flu at home come on on the day they want
[1:03:32] it come on now so you're getting a
[1:03:34] championship ring on and you weren't
[1:03:36] even there than
[1:03:40] Lord but this is God becoming there's a
[1:03:45] process God will never stop
[1:03:49] becoming God will never quit becoming
[1:03:53] brother Bram said eternity will never
[1:03:56] unfold what God really
[1:03:59] is so you have eternity to become with
[1:04:03] him it never ends it never
[1:04:09] stops we become 10 folks he has to give
[1:04:14] before he could raise you up he has to
[1:04:16] give you eternal life when did he give
[1:04:17] you that eternal life before the
[1:04:19] foundation of the world when he wrote
[1:04:22] your name Amen on the book right I did a
[1:04:27] sermon at home called the power in the
[1:04:28] name one time a few months
[1:04:32] ago and I caught something that brother
[1:04:34] Donnie was talking about he was
[1:04:37] preaching sometime last year I don't
[1:04:39] remember but he was talking about
[1:04:42] how if go if God became you and you
[1:04:44] became
[1:04:47] God
[1:04:49] Jesus Christ's name is the very first
[1:04:51] name on that Lamb's Book of
[1:04:54] Life and he had to write yours he can't
[1:04:57] write his without writing yours amen he
[1:05:02] can't why you are
[1:05:04] one you are one my wife can take our
[1:05:06] checkbook if it had just my name on it
[1:05:09] she can write a check to anything she
[1:05:13] wants do y'all have mutual property in
[1:05:15] Virginia how many knows what Mutual
[1:05:17] property
[1:05:18] is I told this to Brother David sers
[1:05:21] Church Sisters listen up
[1:05:26] you might want to take
[1:05:29] notes in the state of Tennessee we have
[1:05:31] what they call Mutual property that big
[1:05:34] F250 that you just bought if she wants
[1:05:37] to sell it she can sell
[1:05:40] it right your motorcycle your guns
[1:05:46] whatever because once you're married
[1:05:48] what's his is
[1:05:50] yours when you became married what was
[1:05:54] God's became yours
[1:05:56] yes sir that's part of the becoming you
[1:05:59] become him he becomes
[1:06:06] you brother brandham said the nature of
[1:06:08] your
[1:06:10] soul not is of
[1:06:12] God and so's in in prison now this is
[1:06:15] the same sermon I think where he
[1:06:16] preached that you are God's Perfection
[1:06:19] you are the Perfection of God but here
[1:06:21] he says the nature of your soul he
[1:06:23] didn't say your nature of your soul is
[1:06:24] of God he said the nature of your soul
[1:06:26] is God it is God that's how much God
[1:06:30] became you the nature of your soul
[1:06:32] brother Bram said your character is the
[1:06:33] only thing you'll take with
[1:06:34] you so there's a lot of your character
[1:06:37] that God has to take out thank you he
[1:06:39] has to take it out because it don't
[1:06:41] match
[1:06:43] his if it's
[1:06:45] not it's of the world if your nature is
[1:06:50] not God it is of the world anything that
[1:06:53] begin has to end so therefore the only
[1:06:55] way that you can have eternal life is to
[1:06:58] have a life that never did begin that's
[1:07:01] right or never will
[1:07:03] end and then your life did begin when
[1:07:05] you were born God breathed the breath of
[1:07:07] life into your nostrils and you became a
[1:07:09] living soul and You Begin then that's
[1:07:12] when you begin when not when you was
[1:07:14] born but it was when God breathed that
[1:07:17] life you had two lives begin right then
[1:07:20] your natural life and your eternal life
[1:07:23] am if you're a seed of God
[1:07:26] only if you're a seat of God
[1:07:28] predestinated there's some people don't
[1:07:30] believe in
[1:07:31] predestination I'm grateful for it I'm
[1:07:34] so glad I'm so glad that it it's been
[1:07:36] revealed to me because listen if if I
[1:07:40] didn't have a full under if I didn't
[1:07:42] have a full understanding and revelation
[1:07:44] of predestination I'd be
[1:07:47] worried I'd be worried because I'd be
[1:07:49] thinking God if I'm really a seed why am
[1:07:51] I doing this why am I failing here why
[1:07:52] am I doing this why am I acting like
[1:07:54] this right but I know go God's grace
[1:07:58] God's grace is extended to your
[1:08:00] predestinated
[1:08:04] life we going to take another turn here
[1:08:09] shortly so the process of you becoming
[1:08:12] didn't start with you it started with
[1:08:13] God right recently we had a wedding at
[1:08:17] home Malachi and
[1:08:19] Khloe you know when I was studying this
[1:08:21] I got to thinking about this
[1:08:26] y'all can tell him later that I preached
[1:08:27] about him wonderful young young man by
[1:08:30] the way and I didn't know there were so
[1:08:31] many
[1:08:32] Spencers
[1:08:34] Lord have
[1:08:36] mercy brother Al's Deacon job's
[1:08:39] full-time job with them Spencers
[1:08:43] lord they're good ones though even
[1:08:45] though they did fight with the
[1:08:49] girls if you know you know
[1:08:52] right so there's a process between a man
[1:08:57] and a
[1:08:58] woman that's going to be
[1:09:01] married she has to become him right
[1:09:04] there is a becoming that takes place
[1:09:06] right now this becoming didn't happen
[1:09:08] when they started dating right it did
[1:09:11] not happen when when Mal went to to Josh
[1:09:14] and and asked for Khloe's hand in
[1:09:15] marriage that that did not start her
[1:09:18] becoming his
[1:09:20] wife there's a lot of people out there
[1:09:23] that Jesus has extended his hand
[1:09:25] remember the Rich Young Ruler amen
[1:09:27] follow me be part of me knowing he's
[1:09:31] going to
[1:09:32] hell that's how that's that's God's
[1:09:35] grace you Jesus walked up to a man God
[1:09:38] in flesh walked to a man knowing pre by
[1:09:40] predestination he's going to hell and
[1:09:42] still offered him a way
[1:09:44] out that's God's grace God's grace
[1:09:48] extended to Cain brother Bram said God
[1:09:49] love came and tried to offer him a way
[1:09:51] out if you just do this
[1:09:55] so what if Khloe had said
[1:10:00] no be rough right now wouldn't
[1:10:04] it if she said no there would be no
[1:10:07] becoming there's many people that Jesus
[1:10:09] has has asked to be their bride or
[1:10:12] offered them they said no that's right
[1:10:15] said no there's no becoming it's not in
[1:10:18] them to become
[1:10:21] himall but he he offered it to you right
[1:10:25] thank you Lord
[1:10:26] and many of you probably didn't accept
[1:10:28] right
[1:10:29] away you didn't accept right
[1:10:32] away it might have took a
[1:10:34] while it might have took a mom and dad
[1:10:36] on their knees for for days and months
[1:10:39] and weeks and
[1:10:41] years trying to get you to accept that
[1:10:44] proposal from almighty God but there had
[1:10:47] to be a
[1:10:48] proposal so whenever Mal goes and asks
[1:10:52] Chloe will you be my wife
[1:10:55] and she accept when she said yes the
[1:10:59] becoming has
[1:11:02] begun The Becoming has
[1:11:04] begun she is in the process of now
[1:11:07] becoming him right when they walk up and
[1:11:10] take the
[1:11:12] vows in front of God and
[1:11:15] everybody and they lift the vows and
[1:11:18] they do their deal and they walk off Mr
[1:11:19] and Mrs Malachi Spencer amen she has
[1:11:24] become his wife but there's more
[1:11:27] becoming that happens that's right it
[1:11:31] didn't end with you in Jesus just a
[1:11:34] marriage you have to produce his life
[1:11:37] right there is a becoming that happens
[1:11:42] inside that produces a life right good
[1:11:46] his life amen so this this this this
[1:11:50] isn't your life will have to produce
[1:11:52] God's life your life will have to
[1:11:53] produce God's eternity your your life
[1:11:56] will have to produce everything that God
[1:12:00] is that's why brother brandom said your
[1:12:03] the nature of your soul is
[1:12:05] God because when you fully become filled
[1:12:08] with the Holy Ghost and his life is
[1:12:10] fully in
[1:12:12] you it's fully in
[1:12:14] you the becoming is becoming that's
[1:12:18] right it will produce only his
[1:12:23] life we look at look at Mary when we see
[1:12:26] Mary when God spoke to Mary and created
[1:12:29] that the seed in Mary everything that
[1:12:31] Mary Mary didn't produce one thing of
[1:12:34] herself God created the egg God created
[1:12:36] the seed everything was of God
[1:12:40] everything in your life that you produce
[1:12:42] will be of God if it's God's
[1:12:46] nature I'm I got too many notes so I'm
[1:12:48] gonna move move ahead sake of
[1:12:50] time so check the life you're producing
[1:12:53] is it God's life
[1:12:57] Bible says God was the
[1:13:00] word your your life if God if you are
[1:13:04] God that's that's so hard for the human
[1:13:07] mind the human mind to
[1:13:10] comprehend that he became you so you
[1:13:12] could become him you're never going to
[1:13:14] go around and tell every brother hey I'm
[1:13:15] God I'm God I'm God they might lock you
[1:13:17] up in
[1:13:20] Woodridge it's it's not that your life
[1:13:23] will say you were God you don't have to
[1:13:25] say it with your mouth you don't have to
[1:13:28] act like a fool and be a spectacle let
[1:13:30] your life tell what God did for you it's
[1:13:34] God's life in you that's right and when
[1:13:36] your nature is nature of your soul is
[1:13:39] God's nature it'll fit in the word like
[1:13:41] a puzzle piece yes sir it'll every every
[1:13:44] aspect of this word will mesh with your
[1:13:46] life yes sir when it's God's
[1:13:50] nature
[1:13:52] good so we come in and we sit down we
[1:13:55] listen to brother Andrew brother Ron
[1:13:57] Brother Wayne whoever's here brother
[1:13:59] brother Matt whoever's preaching what
[1:14:02] they're doing is trying to fit your life
[1:14:04] into that word you they are helping you
[1:14:08] become the word that's what this place
[1:14:11] is the house of judgment right it's the
[1:14:13] house of correction if we got edges that
[1:14:14] don't fit we fix them if we got things
[1:14:17] in our life that don't belong there we
[1:14:19] cut them off the word is like a
[1:14:21] two-edged sword so you come in here now
[1:14:24] some people won't accept that because
[1:14:25] their favorite Minister ain't here come
[1:14:27] on brother your favorite Minister ain't
[1:14:29] here for some reason the pastor you just

[1:14:52] giving the word or are you listening to
[1:14:54] the word
[1:15:01] if you're listening to the word you will
[1:15:03] become the word if you are focused on
[1:15:05] that man you can't become the
[1:15:11] word good it ain't about your favorite
[1:15:15] preacher that's right you know sometimes

[1:15:42] becoming you don't care who's bringing

[1:16:34] us but they get to the point
[1:16:37] where you know question and answers on
[1:16:40] Thursday with brother Donnie is just the
[1:16:42] new has wore
[1:16:43] off come on the new has wore off the new
[1:16:47] facility the new upper room that we have
[1:16:49] above the kitchen it's wore off all the
[1:16:52] excitement in having something new and
[1:16:54] then you get into a rut you find things
[1:16:57] to do listen I was a
[1:17:00] youth I'm going to be vulnerable here
[1:17:03] sorry honey that's my passenger princess
[1:17:05] in case you'all ain't met
[1:17:07] her
[1:17:09] so I remember one
[1:17:12] night I was in church I played I was 16
[1:17:16] years old 17 years old I played base for
[1:17:19] the youth
[1:17:20] group and then the youth Minister told
[1:17:23] me get up and give a test testimony I
[1:17:26] got up and cried and gave a testimony
[1:17:29] left went to the pool hall and then went
[1:17:31] to
[1:17:38] jail it
[1:17:41] happens it
[1:17:45] happens I guess that's why I got in law
[1:17:47] [Laughter]
[1:17:49] enforcement figured I'd catch a break
[1:17:51] next time
[1:17:55] but we all we we've all got things in
[1:17:57] our life that pull us aside maybe not
[1:18:01] that
[1:18:02] drastic I hope not come on come
[1:18:07] on but say that to say that young people
[1:18:10] are going to be young people that's
[1:18:11] right our job is as older people is get
[1:18:14] on our knees yes sir there it is get on
[1:18:16] your knees sir you pray for them keep
[1:18:19] encouraging encouragement encourage him
[1:18:22] to come to the meetings KY I didn't see
[1:18:25] you sitting over there that's another
[1:18:26] that's one of my favorites right there s
[1:18:28] Kylie mcgar she brings me Annie Ruth
[1:18:33] Donuts but young people are going to do
[1:18:35] young people things right you know I
[1:18:39] didn't mean to get off on that but but
[1:18:42] anyways you know be an example be a word
[1:18:45] the Bible says we're written epistle
[1:18:46] read of all men them young people are
[1:18:48] all men they're going to read your life
[1:18:51] they're going to read your attitude
[1:18:53] towards them right they going to see if
[1:18:55] you're projecting love or not they're
[1:18:56] going to see if you are becoming yes
[1:19:00] that's right they want to become yeah
[1:19:02] your youth here they want to become but
[1:19:05] they're fighting battles nowadays that
[1:19:06] we never had to fight brother Andrew
[1:19:09] they're fighting things that they that
[1:19:10] we never had to fight that's
[1:19:13] right so we encourage him in the in the
[1:19:16] in in the
[1:19:18] word I'm going to have to jump because
[1:19:20] I'm going to be here way longer than I I
[1:19:22] planned and I'm not a long preacher I
[1:19:23] promise my record an hour and 8
[1:19:30] minutes but when you become him your
[1:19:33] life will produce him brother we're
[1:19:34] going to take another example of what it
[1:19:37] is like becoming
[1:19:39] God and God becoming you in John 15
[1:19:45] 1-5 Jesus says I am the True
[1:19:48] Vine and my father is the husbandman
[1:19:51] every branch in me that beareth not
[1:19:53] fruit he taketh away in every branch
[1:19:56] that beareth fruit he purges that it may
[1:19:57] bring forth more fruit now you are clean
[1:20:00] through the world which I have spoken of
[1:20:02] you abide in me and I in you as the
[1:20:05] branch cannot bear fruit of itself you
[1:20:07] cannot bear fruit of
[1:20:13] yourself except it abide on the vine no
[1:20:17] more can ye except you abide in me this
[1:20:19] is the what I want to look at I am the
[1:20:21] vine ye are the branches
[1:20:24] he that abideth in me and I in him the
[1:20:27] same bringeth forth much fruit for
[1:20:30] without
[1:20:31] me you can do
[1:20:34] nothing so we're looking at what Jesus
[1:20:36] is telling him I am the
[1:20:38] vine we look at this and and I I I did a
[1:20:42] little research here
[1:20:44] on um I'll get to it in a
[1:20:48] second but Jesus tells him says I am the
[1:20:50] vine you are the
[1:20:52] branch you got to understand the vine
[1:20:56] does not bear the fruit right the vine
[1:21:00] does not bear the fruit we've heard the
[1:21:01] scripture so many times by their fruits
[1:21:04] you shall know them right you will bear
[1:21:06] the fruits of the spirit if his life is
[1:21:08] in you that's right you will bear the
[1:21:10] fruits of what every attribute that God
[1:21:13] is right if God is in you if the life is
[1:21:15] in
[1:21:16] you so the
[1:21:20] vine has the branches this is God
[1:21:23] extending
[1:21:25] himself out in you right you bear the
[1:21:30] fruit are you bearing his fruit or you
[1:21:33] bearing you your fruit
[1:21:35] right brother Bram said what is the
[1:21:37] fruit of the
[1:21:38] spirit love joy Faith peace
[1:21:42] longsuffering that's a part of
[1:21:44] God that's in
[1:21:48] you and can forbearance forbearing one
[1:21:52] another's burdens forgiving one another
[1:21:55] another I have noticed the last
[1:21:59] year most the ministers messages that
[1:22:02] I'm been hearing and even when I study
[1:22:04] it just pops
[1:22:05] up is about
[1:22:08] forgiveness people holding grudges
[1:22:11] people not
[1:22:14] forgiving if if God's life is in you
[1:22:17] you'll forgive them no matter what you
[1:22:19] know I told somebody I told somebody not
[1:22:21] too long ago I said I don't understand
[1:22:22] you know working in law enforcement uh
[1:22:25] I've most of my years in law enforcement
[1:22:27] I was a
[1:22:28] detective and I've worked homicides and
[1:22:30] other stuff and I've seen family members
[1:22:33] from from the victims that were murdered
[1:22:37] forgive forgive somebody that murdered
[1:22:39] your loved one I've seen that and you
[1:22:42] can't get people that claim to be bride
[1:22:44] to forgive each
[1:22:45] other that's a that's a shame that is a
[1:22:49] shame you got people holding grudges
[1:22:51] against somebody else the fruits of the
[1:22:54] spirit is love and
[1:22:56] forgiveness come on you you get all
[1:22:59] dressed up and pry for church you walk
[1:23:00] through the front door like you're the
[1:23:02] most holy person here and you're holding
[1:23:04] a grudge in your heart do you realize
[1:23:06] Jesus when Jesus told them how to pray
[1:23:09] Jesus tells them this is how you pray on
[1:23:12] when you for stand forgive when God
[1:23:14] forgives you you forgive cuz if you do
[1:23:17] not forgive God won't forgive you so if
[1:23:21] you're holding unforgiveness here from
[1:23:23] the very second that unforgiveness
[1:23:25] started in your life God hasn't forgave
[1:23:28] you of one thing not one thing
[1:23:31] everything you've done from that point
[1:23:34] is still on
[1:23:35] you God hasn't forgiven
[1:23:38] you so people take these grudges that
[1:23:41] they got and they attach it they grafted
[1:23:44] in brother brandom talked about grafting
[1:23:45] in they grafted in and they they try to
[1:23:48] put religion on it oh if they was the
[1:23:50] bride they wouldn't have done that to me
[1:23:52] oh my come on I have a right because
[1:23:54] they done this to I'm I'm a bride of
[1:23:56] Christ and they shouldn't have done that
[1:23:57] to
[1:23:59] me God says I'll cut it off yes sir come
[1:24:02] on cuz it don't bear my life that's
[1:24:04] right let me tell you something if
[1:24:06] you're holding a grudge you'll take it
[1:24:09] to hell you will take it to hell cuz God
[1:24:13] brother brandom said your character is
[1:24:14] the only thing you take with you that's
[1:24:16] right and everything only thing that
[1:24:17] will ever go in that land that's right
[1:24:20] is his life and if you're holding Grudge
[1:24:23] and you're holding in forgiveness and
[1:24:24] your heart get ready for three and 1/2
[1:24:26] years right that's all I can tell you
[1:24:29] get ready for three and 1/2 years if you
[1:24:31] can't find that brother and sister
[1:24:32] whoever it is that you can't forgive and
[1:24:35] make that right how do you know you've
[1:24:36] got total forgiveness in your heart how
[1:24:38] do you know you've totally forgive them
[1:24:40] come on how about this every time they
[1:24:42] cross your
[1:24:43] mind every time they enter your heart
[1:24:46] you start speaking to the Lord Lord he
[1:24:48] the blessings on them like they never
[1:24:50] seen and whenever you know when you know
[1:24:53] youve forgive them when you see them you
[1:24:57] will be filled with joy I promise you
[1:25:00] that that's true forgiveness that's
[1:25:02] God's life why because you're seeing
[1:25:03] another member of the
[1:25:05] body why would a branch off a Vine treat
[1:25:08] another Branch off the same Vine like
[1:25:11] that this is God
[1:25:21] becoming the Bible says if it don't bear
[1:25:23] fruit I'm cutting it off off right if it
[1:25:25] doesn't bear fruit it gets cut
[1:25:28] off brother brandom
[1:25:31] said ex um the seven Church ages Patman
[1:25:35] Vision Jesus said I am the vine you the
[1:25:37] branches he is the main Vine which comes
[1:25:39] out of the original root from the
[1:25:40] original sea that has life in it now the
[1:25:43] vine does not bear fruit it is the
[1:25:45] branches that does that that's you
[1:25:48] that's me bearing the fruit so be
[1:25:51] careful what you
[1:25:52] say be careful when you're at
[1:25:55] work I worked with a guy one time he's a
[1:25:58] super wonderful Christian
[1:26:00] now but I worked with a guy one time and
[1:26:04] I'd worked with him for
[1:26:06] years and then somebody that we worked
[1:26:08] with came up to me and said I didn't
[1:26:10] know so and so want same church as
[1:26:12] you let me tell you this
[1:26:15] y'all I don't care where you live around

[1:28:41] people right he got to work it with
[1:28:44] bride he saw it be coming he hadn't seen
[1:28:49] before God's nature changed his mind
[1:28:53] right
[1:28:55] the nature in God in you will change
[1:28:56] people's
[1:28:57] mind that's part of God becoming right
[1:29:01] they may never ever believe this right
[1:29:04] but it might cause them to say something
[1:29:06] kind about your church and when you get
[1:29:08] over there good good When God says who
[1:29:12] you want to let
[1:29:13] in you get to speak for people I don't
[1:29:15] know if you knew that or
[1:29:17] not we've got we've got lists don't we H
[1:29:20] we've got lists of people we're going to
[1:29:22] say Lord please let them inen they were
[1:29:24] so kind never said a bad
[1:29:27] word that is the process at the day of
[1:29:31] judgment where you're still becoming
[1:29:35] God you're becoming the
[1:29:38] judge they treated me with
[1:29:41] kindness Jesus said how you've done to
[1:29:43] the least of these you've done it unto
[1:29:45] me so they weren't treating you with
[1:29:48] kindness it was the becoming within you
[1:29:51] that they were treated with kindness
[1:29:54] amen don't ever take for granted the
[1:29:57] life the impact that your life has on
[1:30:00] people that's right don't ever take for
[1:30:03] granted that you are the light to the
[1:30:06] world the
[1:30:08] world and you're in the world every day
[1:30:11] that don't mean oh I'm the light of the
[1:30:13] world I got to get on a plane flow to
[1:30:15] India on Satan's Eden around you every
[1:30:19] day that's right and God will
[1:30:22] become in Satan's Eden
[1:30:26] amen he has no choice that's just how
[1:30:28] great he
[1:30:29] is it happens it just
[1:30:32] happens when God's life's in you it just
[1:30:36] happens there's nothing you can do about
[1:30:38] it God live through me we sing that song
[1:30:40] flow through me are you giving him
[1:30:43] something to flow
[1:30:45] through you know we we want the gifts we
[1:30:48] want all this stuff in work in your
[1:30:49] lives are you living a life that's
[1:30:51] worthy of the gifts
[1:30:54] right right they're yours they belong to
[1:30:57] you right God says these are these are
[1:31:00] gifts that I've give you to be used for
[1:31:02] the bride this last day is your life in
[1:31:04] such a spot where you can use them come
[1:31:06] on brother we've told in this last days
[1:31:09] these gifts will manifest themselves
[1:31:11] right have you put your life in a place
[1:31:15] where God can use them in you it's good
[1:31:16] brother it's good you might say I've
[1:31:18] never spoken tongues I haven't either I
[1:31:20] don't mean I want one day right
[1:31:25] every gift is not to every single person
[1:31:27] right God chooses who he will
[1:31:31] right you know I was studying this and
[1:31:35] the reason why when I was studying this
[1:31:37] the life of a Vine and it just hit me
[1:31:39] brother man I thought where do seedless
[1:31:41] grapes come
[1:31:45] from you're going to see where I'm going
[1:31:47] in a minute good brother come on how
[1:31:50] many knows how they get seedless grapes
[1:31:52] I didn't know till here I thought they
[1:31:54] sucked them out
[1:31:57] somehow seedless grapes does anybody
[1:32:02] know come
[1:32:03] on when a grape starts to start out on a
[1:32:10] branch the branch is cut
[1:32:12] off it's cut off from the Life Source
[1:32:16] oh and they stick that branch in the
[1:32:21] ground on its own ground
[1:32:25] come on it's got no life in it
[1:32:28] anymore it can't produce a seed without
[1:32:32] a life right
[1:32:35] amen you cannot
[1:32:39] produce a life seed if you don't have
[1:32:42] one right if you've been cut off from
[1:32:45] the vine right there's a lot of people
[1:32:48] God says I'll cut you off if you're not
[1:32:50] producing fruit I'll cut you off if you
[1:32:52] try to produ produce fruit of your own
[1:32:55] kind I'll cut you off right amen so
[1:32:58] looking through this process of how the
[1:33:02] vines happen and I started re
[1:33:04] researching this
[1:33:06] and what is a vine branch and how's it
[1:33:09] become branches and all this because
[1:33:12] when Jesus said I the vine you talking
[1:33:13] about branches people think of trees I'm
[1:33:16] the vine so everything he's referring to
[1:33:17] is is is a
[1:33:19] vine when referring to a vine branch
[1:33:22] becoming signif IES the process of
[1:33:25] growing and developing from a small
[1:33:27] Sprout into a mature fruit bearing
[1:33:31] Branch small Sprout when you when you
[1:33:33] started in this message you were just a
[1:33:36] juvenile you were just drinking
[1:33:39] milk there ain't no you couldn't eat
[1:33:41] meat you had to become mature you had to
[1:33:45] keep getting watered by the word that
[1:33:48] former rign had to keep coming had to
[1:33:50] keep coming and had to keep coming
[1:33:56] a small Sprout into a mature F fruit
[1:33:58] bearing Branch entirely dependent on its
[1:34:02] connection to the vine for Life yes sir
[1:34:05] totally
[1:34:08] 100% trusting in the vine
[1:34:11] amen it has to be it depend on the
[1:34:14] connection to the vine for life for
[1:34:16] nourishment and the ability to produce
[1:34:19] grapes you have to be connected to the
[1:34:22] vine you have to depend on the vine to
[1:34:23] produce fruit right cuz if you're not
[1:34:27] you're producing your own right and
[1:34:28] there's no seed in there
[1:34:32] right it embodies the idea of
[1:34:35] transformation and maturation to the
[1:34:37] independent its dependence on the vine
[1:34:40] itself and I'm going to I'm going to
[1:34:41] jump I have to jump I'm getting I'm back
[1:34:43] up
[1:34:44] here so when I was looking at thinking
[1:34:47] about God cutting vines off or cutting
[1:34:50] branches off you know when I was I was
[1:34:53] thinking about I had
[1:34:54] a a young lady I was talking to at
[1:34:57] church and she had some things in her
[1:34:59] past and she told me you know what I
[1:35:01] encouraged her she said yeah I know I
[1:35:03] think about that every time I remind
[1:35:05] myself of my
[1:35:08] transgressions I told her I said why are
[1:35:10] you reminding
[1:35:11] yourself why are you reminding yourself
[1:35:14] that God forgave you why do you when God
[1:35:17] forgives you or something do you realize
[1:35:18] you're reminding yourself of something
[1:35:20] he don't even know about that's God has
[1:35:23] no recollection of it so I got to
[1:35:24] thinking when God cut that off God
[1:35:27] delivered her of that forgiveness cut
[1:35:29] that fruitless Branch off that's right
[1:35:33] so you know I got to thinking about
[1:35:34] people that that go in and have surgery
[1:35:36] and they get Lums limbs cut off brother
[1:35:37] mat they get the the limbs cut up and
[1:35:39] they wake up from surgery and they think
[1:35:41] they still have it right they you've
[1:35:45] heard people tell talk to Medical people
[1:35:47] they say they still feel like they have
[1:35:48] their arm their hand and they believe
[1:35:49] they can my wife's cousin he had a
[1:35:51] motorcycle wreck he's passed on now but
[1:35:53] he had motorcycle wreck cut both his
[1:35:55] legs
[1:35:56] off both of his legs off hit a guardrail
[1:35:58] took him
[1:35:59] off and he thought he was running up the
[1:36:02] hill he tried on
[1:36:04] stumps but in his mind he still had his
[1:36:07] legs on he thought they were still there
[1:36:10] this young lady a good sister she
[1:36:13] thought her transgressions were still
[1:36:14] there cuz she was still reminding
[1:36:16] herself and she I told her God's cut
[1:36:18] that off God's delivered you of that why
[1:36:21] are you reminding yourself of a branch
[1:36:24] that didn't bear fruit that God said I I
[1:36:26] took it away I cut anything off that
[1:36:29] doesn't bear
[1:36:30] fruit thank you Lord
[1:36:33] good the devil has talked some of some
[1:36:36] of us of grafting your shame in into the
[1:36:38] vine in your branch you're grafted in I
[1:36:40] got to live with this shame what's what
[1:36:42] I've done my past I've got to live with
[1:36:44] shame the devil told you that right you
[1:36:48] ever you ever hear Brother brandom
[1:36:50] telling some of you might actually I've
[1:36:51] never seen him my brother has seen him
[1:36:53] how take a a lemon tree and they'll
[1:36:56] they'll they'll graft an orange Branch
[1:36:58] into that tree right what do y'all think
[1:37:01] it
[1:37:05] produces an
[1:37:07] orange because it ain't got the life of
[1:37:09] the tree in it right it's got its own
[1:37:11] life in the ranch that it's on it'll
[1:37:13] never produce a lemon right so people
[1:37:16] have grafted these things on that's not
[1:37:18] bearing the fruit that God gave them
[1:37:20] that's right they think part part of
[1:37:23] myself that that's a
[1:37:24] Catholicism idea that you got to beat
[1:37:26] yourself from Penance for for something
[1:37:28] that you've done the devil has told you
[1:37:30] that the devil has told you that you
[1:37:32] have to take this shame they've grafted
[1:37:34] in depression they've grafted in anxiety
[1:37:36] in their life and they're letting Satan
[1:37:38] talk to them saying I have to live with
[1:37:40] this yes
[1:37:41] sir you realize when nothing against
[1:37:44] medication but people have quit praying
[1:37:46] and start taking
[1:37:48] pills you've done the same thing the
[1:37:50] children of Israel did when God said you
[1:37:52] kick everybody out out you kill
[1:37:55] everybody man woman and child you don't
[1:37:57] kill that child he's going to raise up
[1:37:58] to be a malachite and he's going to take
[1:38:00] your land right God said kill them all
[1:38:03] so what did they do they they pushed
[1:38:04] them into the corner and they let them
[1:38:06] stay there that's
[1:38:08] right that's what people are doing in
[1:38:10] their
[1:38:12] lives and they're taking a pill they've
[1:38:14] settled for a pill when God said you
[1:38:16] could be healed right you don't have to
[1:38:19] be that
[1:38:20] way I'm not against doctors I'm not
[1:38:22] against pills
[1:38:24] no if it helps you more power to you but
[1:38:26] don't cling to that as your ultimate
[1:38:27] healing yes sir God said you are
[1:38:33] healed don't settle for something that
[1:38:35] the devil told you well this will help
[1:38:37] you right that's what the children of
[1:38:39] Israel said well they'll help us till
[1:38:40] the land they'll help us do this and
[1:38:42] they'll help us build houses they'll
[1:38:43] help us do
[1:38:46] this God becoming in you will push
[1:38:49] everything out of your life that is not
[1:38:51] like him you got cancer God said push it
[1:38:54] out you got depression push it out
[1:38:56] you've got anxiety you've got worries
[1:38:58] you got financial difficulties God said
[1:39:00] push it
[1:39:01] out I don't know what time I started
[1:39:04] let's stand
[1:39:06] together you know as I studying this and
[1:39:08] I I got down to towards the end and I
[1:39:10] don't know if any of y'all remember who
[1:39:15] uh but miles row was old black Minister
[1:39:20] from uh I think he was from the Bahamas
[1:39:25] wonderful man
[1:39:27] great understanding of the message I say
[1:39:31] understanding of of the word the
[1:39:33] scriptures I got to listening to him one
[1:39:35] day and he's and I got to thinking of
[1:39:39] this the disciples wanted to become like
[1:39:43] Jesus they wanted to become he was
[1:39:46] through
[1:39:48] everything Peter's like I'll kill for
[1:39:50] you
[1:39:52] whatever they wanted to be like him so
[1:39:54] he said how do we talk to God how do we
[1:39:58] pray why they they wanted to talk yeah
[1:40:03] they wanted to have a one-on-one
[1:40:04] relationship brother Andrew teach us how
[1:40:07] to talk teach us how to
[1:40:10] pray and so Jesus tells him in this
[1:40:13] after this manner therefore pray you oh
[1:40:15] Father which art in heaven Hallowed be
[1:40:17] the thy name you started off with giving
[1:40:19] God praise that's right Giving Him
[1:40:21] worship
[1:40:24] thy kingdom come Lord let your will be
[1:40:26] done on Earth as it is in
[1:40:29] heaven give us this day our daily bread
[1:40:32] you're getting your daily bread
[1:40:34] today this is your daily
[1:40:36] bread I'll prove it to a minute in a
[1:40:38] minute he wasn't talking about regular
[1:40:40] food that you
[1:40:42] eat forgive us our debts as we forgive
[1:40:47] our debtors this prayer is going to
[1:40:49] worshiping God and praying for others
[1:40:52] that's right
[1:40:55] and lead us not into temptation but
[1:40:57] Deliver Us from Evil they knew he could
[1:41:00] do that they seen him do it they seen
[1:41:02] him overcome the Temptation in the
[1:41:05] wilderness for thine is the kingdom they
[1:41:08] finish up again with praise glory and
[1:41:12] worship for thine is the kingdom the
[1:41:14] power and the glory
[1:41:16] forever amen so he's telling him asking
[1:41:19] him Lord teach us to pray and I got to
[1:41:22] think that and goes on say in chapter 6
[1:41:26] he goes then he says therefore take no
[1:41:28] thought saying what shall we eat he's
[1:41:31] not when you he said give us your daily
[1:41:33] bread he was talking about this right
[1:41:36] give no thought what you eat you ain't
[1:41:37] got to ask for
[1:41:39] it or what shall we drink or wherewith
[1:41:44] All Shall we be
[1:41:45] clothed you ain't got to ask for things
[1:41:48] of
[1:41:50] life he says your heavenly father knows
[1:41:54] you have need of all these things right
[1:41:57] seek you first his kingdom
[1:42:00] right what is this
[1:42:03] Kingdom John said when the angel come
[1:42:06] you want to see the
[1:42:09] bride what did he show him the Kingdom
[1:42:12] right you are the
[1:42:14] kingdom you are what he lives
[1:42:18] in so I got to think and he said all
[1:42:21] this stuff
[1:42:24] all these things shall be added unto
[1:42:28] you you don't have to
[1:42:30] ask don't get down every day and pray
[1:42:35] Lord I got cancer please take this
[1:42:38] cancer Lord I'm depressed I've got
[1:42:41] Suicidal
[1:42:43] Thoughts you ain't got to pray for
[1:42:47] that it's been added to

[1:42:59] had don't beat yourself up praying for
[1:43:01] your son or your
[1:43:03] daughter it's been added to
