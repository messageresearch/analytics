[19:02] remembering that family there have we
[19:05] have an unspoken request youd like to
[19:07] lift up to the Lord this evening amen
[19:09] I'm going to ask our brother Gabriel
[19:10] Spencer if he would just come lead us to
[19:13] the throne of grace this
[19:22] evening I shared this at Dad's church
[19:25] here a couple weeks ago and um what I
[19:28] had told told them as I'd woke up I'd
[19:30] woke up one morning and was getting
[19:32] ready for work but as I rolled out of
[19:34] bed the scripture Hebrews 12 and one
[19:37] just came out of my mouth and I wasn't
[19:39] really sure even what I was speaking at
[19:41] the time and so I went and I looked at
[19:43] it and I saw that that was that's a
[19:45] scripture we've heard it a lot um let us
[19:47] run and that's what our pastor took and
[19:50] he took that message and when he heard
[19:52] that from Brother Ed bisc he was one of
[19:55] the ones that took that inspiration and
[19:57] said what can I do with that
[19:59] and I believe that if we can all as a
[20:01] people here take that inspiration that
[20:03] our pastor has laid before us because we
[20:05] all are going to touch a life
[20:07] that another one's not we're going to
[20:10] come in contact with people that each
[20:11] and every one of us are not so take that
[20:14] inspiration and let's run let's run and
[20:16] ever since that I uh this the service
[20:19] let us run it it popped up and then
[20:21] right after that um finishers finishers
[20:24] had popped up that brother Danny steeman
[20:26] had spoke in Louisiana and he opened the
[20:28] service up with Hebrews 12:1 and I
[20:30] believe there's a purpose in that and it
[20:32] and it's time it's time to finish it's
[20:34] not those who start it's those who
[20:36] finish and so let's let's take that and
[20:38] let's run like never before because it's
[20:41] not one it's not two and we know and we
[20:43] can just take we can just take what our
[20:45] pastors laid before us time and time
[20:47] again and let's run let's finish the
[20:49] race and I pray every day that if I can
[20:51] come in contact with one person and let
[20:54] them see Christ that's what I want to do
[20:57] no matter what I do let them see Christ
[21:00] let's just take these knees before the
[21:02] Lord gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're
[21:05] just so humbled and just grateful to be
[21:08] able to come and be in be in this
[21:10] service and be able to come and be here
[21:12] in your presence Lord and we could be in
[21:14] so many places and we can be out in the
[21:16] world and all of us have a testimony all
[21:19] of us have a have a walk that you've
[21:21] allowed us to walk through but Lord
[21:23] Jesus you've allowed us to do that to be
[21:25] able to show us your grace Lord Lord you
[21:27] you allow us to get sick and you see the
[21:29] ones that are sick and needy and we see
[21:31] the we see the little baby there in Uva
[21:33] and Lord Jesus I believe that you could
[21:35] just move on that need just right now
[21:37] and you can remove the fluid and they
[21:39] might not know exactly why it's there
[21:42] but allow them to be able to to be able
[21:43] to testify they don't even know how it
[21:45] left because Lord Jesus we know that
[21:47] you're the Healer and you're the you're
[21:49] the great physician Lord and each and
[21:51] every one of these needs we may not
[21:53] understand everything and as brother
[21:55] Donnie spoke last week at that meeting
[21:57] is allow us to be able to take your nose
[21:59] as well as we don't we don't know we
[22:01] don't know your wisdom we don't know
[22:02] what what you may be moving upon and how
[22:05] you may be working but Lord Jesus allow
[22:07] us to be a Christian that can take your
[22:08] NOS just as well as we can take your
[22:10] yeses Lord and Lord I just pray that you
[22:12] could just come and you could just move
[22:14] in this service like never before as you
[22:17] come each and every time and we we could
[22:19] just feel your presence and that's what
[22:20] we ask for once again as we just invite
[22:23] you to come and come and just save one
[22:25] more Soul if it's one it's worth 10,000
[22:27] worlds and Lord Jesus Jesus I'm
[22:28] believing that all of us should never
[22:30] become stagnant in our walk but allow us
[22:32] to be able to just grow higher and allow
[22:34] us not to become comfortable where we're
[22:36] at but allow us always to be able to ask
[22:39] you for more ask you for more of the
[22:41] Holy Ghost a renewing of the baptism of
[22:43] the Holy Ghost Lord and I just pray that
[22:45] you could just come down tonight and
[22:47] remove anything that is unlike you and
[22:48] allow us to become more Christlike I ask
[22:51] that you would just anoint brother
[22:52] Andrew as you've done once once and time
[22:54] and time again before anoint him tonight
[22:57] use the gift that you've placed inside
[22:58] out of his life and allow him to just
[23:00] speak the word speak the word tonight
[23:02] that it may reach into the depths of our
[23:04] soul that we could just draw closer to
[23:06] you and that's in Jesus name we pray

[52:12] Spirit and not only myself but every
[52:15] person here under the sound of our voice
[52:17] Lord I know God that you're going to do
[52:19] something spectacular here father Lord I

[53:32] your
[53:35] heart I come to have a good time tonight
[53:38] amen Joel chapter 3 and verse 9 and I
[53:42] like to speak to you um this this
[53:44] thought that's as I said it's been on my
[53:47] heart for about four weeks now on
[53:49] prepare for war in peace and for peace
[53:53] in war prepare for war in peace and for
[53:57] peace in war Joel chapter 3 and9
[54:00] Proclaim ye this amongst the Gentiles
[54:03] prepare War wake up the Mighty Men let
[54:07] all the men of War draw near and let
[54:09] them come up beat your plow shares un
[54:13] swords and your pruning hooks into
[54:16] Spears and let the weak say I am strong
[54:21] Romans chapter 8 and verse 5
[54:34] very familiar scripture
[54:36] reading to us as Christians and if
[54:38] you're a if you're a fresh Christian I
[54:40] would memorize Romans chapter
[54:44] 8 Romans 8 chapter 8 and verse 5 for
[54:47] they that are after The Flesh do mind
[54:50] the things of the flesh but they that
[54:52] are after the spirit the things of the
[54:55] spirit for to be carnally minded is
[54:58] death but to be spiritually minded is
[55:01] life and peace because the carnal mind
[55:04] is enmity against God for it is not
[55:07] subject to the law of God neither indeed
[55:10] can be so then they that are in the
[55:12] flesh cannot please God but you are not
[55:15] in the flesh but in the spirit if so be
[55:19] that the spirit of God dwell in you now
[55:21] if any man have not the spirit of Christ
[55:24] he is none of of his may God bless his
[55:28] word you may be seated here tonight in
[55:29] the presence of the Lord amen as we said
[55:33] we'd like to speak to you on on prepare
[55:35] for
[55:36] war in
[55:38] peace and for peace in war and that word
[55:42] prepared it means it means to make ready
[55:46] beforehand for some purpose to use or or
[55:49] activity to make ready for the activity
[55:52] to make ready for the use of it it's
[55:54] like you sisters that are preparing
[55:55] meals for your family you you have
[55:58] thought you have plans laid out you have
[56:00] things that are you have things that are
[56:02] prepared it to prepare it means to put
[56:04] in a proper state of mind it's you've
[56:07] come here tonight with a preparation to
[56:10] put yourself in a place where you are
[56:12] prepared to listen to the preaching of
[56:14] the word it means to work out the
[56:17] details it means to plan in advance it
[56:20] means to prepare a strategy and brother
[56:22] Brandon would teach us that God's
[56:24] strategy is to take empty vessels an
[56:27] empty take empty vessels and pour empty
[56:30] them out and pour himself in there
[56:32] that's God's strategy and I believe that
[56:34] if you're going to do anything you ought
[56:36] to do it well whether it's in natural or
[56:38] whether it's in a spiritual realm that
[56:40] you ought to do all things well and that
[56:42] you ought to prepare there's got to be
[56:44] preparations for it if you've got to
[56:46] whatever it might be in life you've got
[56:48] to make preparations or the outcome that
[56:51] you're looking for is going to be
[56:53] mediocre it's not going to be what you
[56:55] anticipate or or the success that you
[56:57] have in your mind if you don't prepare
[56:59] for it in such and such way then things
[57:01] are going to fall on the ground and not
[57:03] and not the outcome is not going to be
[57:05] as you desired and the prophet took a
[57:08] took a thought in 1953 and he preached
[57:10] on this message on Preparation he said
[57:13] now God before he does anything he
[57:15] always prepares for it he said before he
[57:18] said before we ever go over and fight a
[57:21] war we've got to prepare for that war
[57:23] and he said if you're ever going to get
[57:25] married why you prepare for that time
[57:27] and if you have preparations and before
[57:29] you come to church you made preparations
[57:32] the ambulance brought you here or your
[57:33] loved one brought you here you had to
[57:35] get a certain amount of money ready
[57:37] before you could come it's preparation
[57:40] and God is always prepares the people
[57:43] for the events that's just about to
[57:45] happen and I believe that we are in
[57:47] great one of the greatest times where we
[57:49] recognize that we we as a people of God
[57:52] are preparing not just to not just to
[57:55] live Christian lives not just to be
[57:57] better people but I believe that we are
[57:59] making preparations for for a for a
[58:02] translation one of these mornings
[58:04] between in the seventh hour between the
[58:07] hours of 6 and n as the prophet would
[58:09] say it in the in the message of the
[58:10] Rapture but we realize that that that
[58:13] this message has come that what we have
[58:16] received has prepared our hearts to turn
[58:18] us back to the faith of the Pentecostal
[58:20] fathers but it was this message that did
[58:23] all of that it prepared our hearts so
[58:25] that that we could have the faith to
[58:28] operate the word of God as God said it
[58:30] in his word and I believe that that as
[58:32] the people of God as we are believers of
[58:35] the word of God we have made
[58:37] preparations to get oursel in line by
[58:39] the word of God and I I want to maybe
[58:41] just make this little declaration that
[58:44] somebody here tonight is making room for
[58:46] Their Blessings they're they're they're
[58:48] making ready for it because they have
[58:50] come under anticipation or expectation
[58:53] however you want to say it but they have
[58:55] prepared for something to receive from
[58:57] the word of God that's why there is such
[58:59] a gift in the in the ministry that they
[59:02] gets out of the way and they they study
[59:04] to show them themselves approved and
[59:06] they they get thems they're preparing to
[59:08] bring for the word but there is
[59:10] something on the other side of it like a
[59:12] deep calling to the Deep where somebody
[59:14] is preparing whatever God has for them
[59:17] no matter what it is no matter what form
[59:20] it comes in whether it's in song or
[59:22] whether it's in testimony or whether
[59:23] it's by the preaching of the word they
[59:25] make it ready for it just like Elizabeth
[59:28] when she was there with her husband
[59:30] Zacharias and she'd been 6 months along
[59:33] in her pregnancy and she hadn't felt no
[59:35] move on the inside of her in the inside
[59:37] of her womb because little John hadn't
[59:39] come to life yet but she all that time
[59:42] she was expecting that that if God could
[59:45] do the miraculous in her old age that
[59:48] surely she was going to make
[59:49] preparations so she was sitting there
[59:52] and she was making her house ready she
[59:54] was she was she was knitting getting
[59:56] things together why because because
[59:58] maybe she was in a spot where where she
[1:00:00] was in a in a terrible condition by
[1:00:03] looking at the natural circumstances but
[1:00:05] even in the worst of circumstances when
[1:00:08] it didn't look like there was no life
[1:00:10] there Elizabeth still prepared because
[1:00:13] she recognized there was power that was
[1:00:16] behind this this wasn't just some
[1:00:19] phenomena that happened but there was
[1:00:21] prophecy that I was allowing her to make
[1:00:23] herself ready to get into a POS position
[1:00:26] that the miraculous could come into her
[1:00:28] body and she could produce the
[1:00:31] miraculous I think it's sometimes when
[1:00:33] you are in your worst conditions and
[1:00:35] when you are in a spot where you don't
[1:00:37] fully understand the phenomenas that are
[1:00:39] happening that it's in those times that
[1:00:42] the supernatural truly takes
[1:00:45] place the prophet said it like this he
[1:00:48] said that's the way to do he said you
[1:00:49] got to make ready for it tonight he said
[1:00:52] I love this he said make ready for it
[1:00:54] tonight he said get your blanket off
[1:00:57] your B off your body get your foot on
[1:00:59] the floor get ready to come out of that
[1:01:02] wheelchair come off the bed and make
[1:01:04] ready for it what are you saying brother
[1:01:06] Andrew I'm saying this get your foot on
[1:01:08] the
[1:01:11] floor come on somebody take your take
[1:01:13] the blankets off your body put your foot
[1:01:16] on the floor get up out of your
[1:01:18] condition make ready for
[1:01:22] it because God who makes a promise he
[1:01:25] keeps a promise if you'll water with
[1:01:28] praises of thank you Lord positive that
[1:01:31] you know what you're doing for your
[1:01:33] standing on his
[1:01:36] promises woo where you got your foot
[1:01:39] tonight brother Andrew I got my foot on
[1:01:41] the promise I got my foot out there and
[1:01:43] it don't it don't look like I should
[1:01:45] have my foot out there it may not look
[1:01:47] like I need to have my foot out there
[1:01:50] but I got my foot out there maybe your
[1:01:53] boss has been upset with you this week
[1:01:56] and you're ready for a change get your
[1:01:58] foot on the
[1:02:01] floor maybe you've had some had some
[1:02:04] bubblings this week or some babblings
[1:02:06] this week with your wife and you're
[1:02:08] ready for those things to be over put
[1:02:10] your foot on the floor maybe your
[1:02:13] business isn't prospering the way that
[1:02:15] you want it but get your foot on the
[1:02:17] floor make ready for
[1:02:21] it now in
[1:02:23] 1790 during during his first annual
[1:02:26] address to Joint session there in
[1:02:28] Congress George Washington would stand
[1:02:30] there and he he would State this he said
[1:02:33] now to be prepared for war is one of the
[1:02:36] most effectual means of preserving
[1:02:39] peace to be prepared for war is the most
[1:02:43] effectual means of preserving Peace So
[1:02:46] if you if you want to have peace in your
[1:02:48] life you got to have some war in your
[1:02:53] life I brother Andre goes against my
[1:02:56] Christian background let me say this you
[1:02:58] you cannot be a Christian without going
[1:02:59] to
[1:03:00] war you cannot be a 21st century
[1:03:04] so-called Christian where you believe
[1:03:05] that love is everything love thy
[1:03:07] neighbor as thyself and we have a loving
[1:03:09] God love all the all the all the all the
[1:03:13] people that have their titles of what
[1:03:15] they want to be identified as you cannot
[1:03:19] identify as that kind of a Christian and
[1:03:21] be an overcomer of Le osia
[1:03:26] are you with me but if you're going to
[1:03:28] be a Christian and do you want to be a
[1:03:32] Christian I'm not just talking about a
[1:03:34] church goer I'm not just talking about
[1:03:36] that somebody that takes up a Pew but
[1:03:39] I'm talking about a Christian a
[1:03:41] Christian to be Christlike then there's
[1:03:44] got to be some times in your life when
[1:03:47] you go to war war with yourself war with
[1:03:50] your mind war with Satan war with demons
[1:03:54] and war with all of
[1:04:02] yourself the prophet said in putting on
[1:04:06] the whole armor of God he said I believe
[1:04:08] it was Lincoln that said one time in
[1:04:10] peace prepare for war he said it may not
[1:04:12] have been he said but it sounds like
[1:04:14] seems to me rather it was it was he that
[1:04:16] made the statement in time of peace
[1:04:18] prepare for war and that would be a good
[1:04:20] thing for us to think about in the time
[1:04:22] while everything's running smooth you
[1:04:24] better get ready for Satan is going to
[1:04:26] he he said he he's he isn't going to let
[1:04:28] it run smooth very long you're in a
[1:04:31] convention now and everything just
[1:04:33] pouring along just fine but you're going
[1:04:36] to leave here in a few days and you're
[1:04:38] going to meet the enemy he said he might
[1:04:40] not even wait for you to get ready to
[1:04:42] leave he just might attack you at any
[1:04:44] time so he's wicked and ruthless he he
[1:04:47] just carries on whenever he can whatever
[1:04:49] he can say or he does it like that he
[1:04:51] said he said so it's best to be dressed
[1:04:53] all the time you might meet him on the
[1:04:55] Street out there you might meet him in
[1:04:57] your car it's hard telling where you're
[1:04:59] going to meet at him where you're going
[1:05:01] to meet him at and I think that if it
[1:05:03] that all of us could say that we would
[1:05:05] enjoy a time of
[1:05:10] peace I think we could all say that that
[1:05:12] we would enjoy a time of Peace where
[1:05:14] we're not constantly battling with Satan
[1:05:16] and and constantly battling with our
[1:05:19] mind and constantly battling with the
[1:05:21] the wars of attrition and the and the
[1:05:23] things that Satan constantly battling
[1:05:25] with us and constantly having to put up
[1:05:27] with Satan and his assments against the
[1:05:29] Church of the Living God but if you're
[1:05:32] ever going to get in peace you've got to
[1:05:34] fight for
[1:05:36] peace you got to fight for peace I
[1:05:39] believe that you can have perfect peace
[1:05:41] because the Bible said in Isaiah chapter
[1:05:43] 26 that I will keep him in perfect peace
[1:05:47] whose mind is stayed on me so I believe
[1:05:50] that you can live there it's just how
[1:05:53] bad do you want to live in peace
[1:05:58] now you watch people that are constantly
[1:06:00] bickering and fighting in their marriage
[1:06:02] they just truly don't want peace there
[1:06:05] are Hallelujah I'm preaching there are
[1:06:08] certain people that are not that are not
[1:06:10] enjoying love unless they got to make up
[1:06:13] for
[1:06:15] something ah let me leave that alone
[1:06:18] just for a minute because there's a lot
[1:06:19] of things I know that could go right
[1:06:21] there but there are some people that are
[1:06:23] never happy without a fight
[1:06:26] they're constantly wanting to jab at
[1:06:28] somebody with their lips with their
[1:06:29] mouth with their with their actions but
[1:06:32] I'm not that kind of Christian I'm me
[1:06:35] I'm not going to back up from a fight
[1:06:36] I'm not I'm not going to back down but I
[1:06:38] tell you what life's too good to be
[1:06:40] fighting all the
[1:06:41] [Applause]
[1:06:47] time Life's Too Sweet Life's too short
[1:06:51] why we constantly got to be fighting
[1:06:53] against this one and fussing about
[1:06:55] politics and fussing about what's going
[1:06:58] on in the world let's live in
[1:07:02] peace if anybody can live in peace the
[1:07:06] body of Jesus Christ ought to be able to
[1:07:09] live in
[1:07:15] peace
[1:07:16] Hallelujah brother maram would say it
[1:07:18] like this when he would talk about
[1:07:21] Eisenhower Eisenhower he brother
[1:07:24] brandham had great admiration for eisenh
[1:07:26] how he said when we were fighting Eisen
[1:07:28] said he said he said there's many times
[1:07:30] we picked up a shell and throw it in the
[1:07:31] gun and pulled the hammer on it and let
[1:07:34] it fall and it snapped and it didn't go
[1:07:35] off he said we didn't surrender he said
[1:07:38] we might have put another one in and it
[1:07:39] snapped too he said we didn't give up we
[1:07:42] just kept on snapping till the one went
[1:07:44] off he said that's the way to win the
[1:07:46] war is keep trying throw a shell in it
[1:07:50] put it in it you got a purpose and a
[1:07:52] Target to hit well if that's scripture
[1:07:55] didn't work get another
[1:07:59] one come on somebody come on somebody if
[1:08:03] this one didn't work today pick up
[1:08:05] another one don't give up on God don't
[1:08:09] give up on one scripture don't give up
[1:08:12] when you prayed and it didn't come to
[1:08:15] pass put another one in your mouth put
[1:08:18] it on your lips speak it out of your
[1:08:21] mouth believe it accept it profess it
[1:08:25] and live that
[1:08:30] way and the sudden secret going away of
[1:08:32] the church I was reading an article some
[1:08:35] time ago on a sudden attack on Pearl
[1:08:37] Harbor he said there wasn't no exactly
[1:08:39] unknown attack he said they'd already
[1:08:41] been warned that the Japs were going to
[1:08:43] do that he said but the sad part was
[1:08:46] they ignored the warning they had signs
[1:08:49] in the Japanese Army assembling
[1:08:51] themselves together and a big ship's
[1:08:52] being loaded with ammunition and the
[1:08:54] threat was in the air and they were just
[1:08:57] exactly in line for the invasion but
[1:08:59] they ignored it he said that's the way
[1:09:01] it is today with the church the church
[1:09:03] is in line of judgment but they're
[1:09:05] ignoring the coming of the
[1:09:08] Lord you know it's coming the world
[1:09:12] knows it's coming the world can feel the
[1:09:14] pressure of
[1:09:16] it let me I don't know how much longer
[1:09:18] we're going to be here but give us four
[1:09:21] and a half more years here on Earth and
[1:09:23] you'll have somebody else to war with
[1:09:25] about going who's in office so don't get
[1:09:28] so tore up about their
[1:09:32] policies that's not my
[1:09:36] War well preach about Trump preach about
[1:09:39] Harris that's not my
[1:09:42] War but I'll tell you what my war is
[1:09:46] it's about getting your children saved
[1:09:48] about seeing you miss the tribulation
[1:09:51] it's about seeing
[1:09:52] you living overcoming life and having
[1:09:56] the power to defeat every Power in hell
[1:09:59] that's my
[1:10:00] War so that's a worthy fight so that's
[1:10:04] what I'll fight
[1:10:05] [Applause]
[1:10:09] for I ain't got enough time to talk
[1:10:12] about all the things that are going on
[1:10:14] in the school world where we got kids
[1:10:17] that are having deal with all the
[1:10:19] pressures with all the pressures of of
[1:10:22] homosexuality and sodomy and everything
[1:10:24] else
[1:10:26] I don't have enough time to spend with
[1:10:27] every little child and talk to them
[1:10:29] about the wars that they are in in their
[1:10:32] own human flesh but I do have a
[1:10:36] word and this word will work for you
[1:10:39] whether it's in this situation as a
[1:10:41] little bitty old child or as an adult as
[1:10:45] a son and daughter of
[1:10:47] God no weapon that is formed against you
[1:10:51] shall
[1:10:53] prosper the gates of hell cannot
[1:11:02] Prevail so what are you saying brother
[1:11:04] Andrew I'm saying if you're going to
[1:11:06] leave this world you've got to make
[1:11:08] preparations just like Noah did because
[1:11:12] God told him it was going to rain and he
[1:11:14] believed it so he made preparations for
[1:11:17] it and he started building an ark there
[1:11:20] was a lot of people that didn't
[1:11:22] understand the
[1:11:24] preparations but he kept on working
[1:11:27] there was a lot of people that don't
[1:11:28] understand why you believe this message
[1:11:30] like you do but God promised it and
[1:11:33] you're making preparations for it
[1:11:36] because if God said that tonight that
[1:11:38] Gabriel is going to find peace in his
[1:11:41] family then God has got he's got a
[1:11:43] reason to say those things he's got a
[1:11:46] reason to speak to those things he's got
[1:11:48] a reason just like if you had healing if
[1:11:51] you needed healing in your body and God
[1:11:53] already made a way for that
[1:11:55] all you got to do is get yourself in
[1:12:00] line get in line for it get in line for
[1:12:04] restoration get in line for your Miracle
[1:12:06] get in line for your
[1:12:08] healing because the Bible said in in 1
[1:12:11] Corinthians 14:8 that if the trumpet
[1:12:14] give an uncertain sound who shall
[1:12:16] prepare himself to battle the things
[1:12:18] that you have heard there is nothing
[1:12:21] uncertain about this
[1:12:23] message there's nothing nothing
[1:12:25] uncertain about William bram's message
[1:12:27] there's nothing uncertain about this
[1:12:30] word so if you know what you have heard
[1:12:34] is nothing but thus sayith the Lord you
[1:12:37] can stake your soul on it you can raise
[1:12:39] your children on it you can defeat Satan
[1:12:42] with it because you are going to fight
[1:12:44] for your
[1:12:45] peace let me talk to you daddies it's
[1:12:48] time to fight like a
[1:12:51] man it's time to be a man and Fight Like
[1:12:53] a Man it's time that you take back
[1:12:57] everything that the devil stole out of
[1:12:59] your
[1:13:00] family if he's put TV in your life if
[1:13:04] he's put not pornography in your life if
[1:13:06] he's put demonic powers in your
[1:13:09] life if he's robbed you of your prayer
[1:13:12] life as the head of your home be a man
[1:13:16] and take it
[1:13:22] back if you want real peace
[1:13:25] you got to fight dirty
[1:13:28] sometimes if you want real peace he came
[1:13:31] in there and slipped under the garden
[1:13:33] walls in the most intricate place that
[1:13:36] there ever was the most guarded Place
[1:13:40] surely if he can get into the Garden of
[1:13:42] Eden he can get in your mind and if he
[1:13:45] can get in your mind he'll get in your
[1:13:47] soul if he's if he's
[1:13:49] able but praise be to
[1:13:52] God you cannot be deceived
[1:13:55] because it ain't possible to deceive the
[1:13:58] elect of God so if he has slipped into
[1:14:01] your home if he has slipped into your
[1:14:03] prayer life if he has slipped into your
[1:14:08] marriage take it
[1:14:11] back come on he ain't going to leave you
[1:14:13] here without a fight he's going to fight
[1:14:15] you day in and day out as a son and
[1:14:17] daughter of God but you be a man like
[1:14:20] Paul said quit you like
[1:14:23] men quit you like men Stand Fast in the
[1:14:26] faith and be
[1:14:34] strong
[1:14:37] h brother Gabriel
[1:14:40] has has been
[1:14:43] a a
[1:14:45] subnormal in his field of
[1:14:48] work where men can't understand how a
[1:14:52] young boy could rise to this potential
[1:14:54] that he is in
[1:14:56] and they have
[1:14:57] invested they have invested thousands of
[1:15:01] dollars in that human
[1:15:04] vessel they have spent time in studies
[1:15:07] and and intellectual things because they
[1:15:10] see
[1:15:11] something that it can produce what
[1:15:14] they're looking for now they didn't send
[1:15:17] him to those schools just to so that he
[1:15:20] could say he went there and as a prophet
[1:15:22] would say that we didn't come here to
[1:15:24] eat cookies
[1:15:25] but they s him there for training for
[1:15:28] such a reason because there are things
[1:15:30] that have got to be figured out and when
[1:15:33] a computer can't figured out you cannot
[1:15:35] defeat the power of a human
[1:15:39] mind because there are certain instincts
[1:15:42] that God places in human
[1:15:45] beings it's amazing when somebody is
[1:15:47] born to be a
[1:15:49] peacemaker God deposited something on
[1:15:52] the inside of him it's like you can't
[1:15:54] explain why Matthew always shows up at
[1:15:56] the right time whether to save you
[1:15:58] whether you're choking or whether you're
[1:16:00] in a fire
[1:16:03] or I won't tell you everything that he's
[1:16:06] kept us from but it literally amazes us
[1:16:09] as a family how many times when when
[1:16:11] we're in the midst of a crisis of
[1:16:13] somebody some somebody needing CPR while
[1:16:16] you're eating ice
[1:16:18] cream
[1:16:22] gar Matthew steps right in he will was
[1:16:25] born with something on the inside of
[1:16:28] him that Mom and Dad didn't put
[1:16:32] there it's like all these all of these
[1:16:36] things that brother Gabriel's had to go
[1:16:38] through he's went through them for a
[1:16:40] reason because there's something on the
[1:16:43] other side of the
[1:16:44] training that'll make him more
[1:16:46] sufficient that'll make him a more
[1:16:50] qualified I'm dancing around it so you
[1:16:53] know what I'm saying but it's
[1:16:56] time whether you are in your position
[1:16:59] whether you're a
[1:17:00] janitor whether you're a cak maker
[1:17:03] whether you're a bomb
[1:17:05] Builder whether you're a teacher I don't
[1:17:08] care what you
[1:17:10] are God put something on the inside of
[1:17:14] you that he deposited that the world
[1:17:17] can't take away from
[1:17:21] you well you say well that scripture is
[1:17:24] just for men be you quit like no
[1:17:26] absolutely
[1:17:27] not when a play when in a place where
[1:17:30] there is no men you women stand out as
[1:17:35] Real Women of Grace So Paul was saying
[1:17:38] study to be a man be a man don't be a
[1:17:41] child don't be carried away with every
[1:17:43] wind of Doctrine that's what he's saying
[1:17:46] he's not saying be
[1:17:53] a we'd all look we'd all love to look
[1:17:56] like brother
[1:17:59] Josh especially
[1:18:02] me I can work out I can run I can I can
[1:18:07] do everything
[1:18:09] possible my wife can put me on a regimen
[1:18:12] to C all of these vitamins that don't
[1:18:13] make no sense to me and I still come out
[1:18:15] looking like a flabby little
[1:18:20] redheaded he Paul ain't talking about
[1:18:22] being a man he's talking about be a man
[1:18:26] be a man of wisdom be a man of scripture
[1:18:29] be a man of understanding don't be
[1:18:31] carried away with every wind of
[1:18:34] Doctrine don't get caught up in here and
[1:18:36] there be a man of the scripture believe
[1:18:39] the
[1:18:41] scripture a prophet said I can take a
[1:18:43] man out there he said that never heard
[1:18:45] of God worshiping an idol and do more
[1:18:47] with him in five minutes and you can do
[1:18:49] with a fellow that that professes to be
[1:18:51] a Christian he's an old mossback
[1:18:53] something that's hung along
[1:18:55] had a lot of inbombing fluid jerked into
[1:18:57] his veins he said puts me in mind of
[1:18:59] some of these old cold morgs down here
[1:19:01] somewhere like an Undertaker
[1:19:03] establishment he said settle down in
[1:19:05] there I go in there he said them old big
[1:19:08] old churches he said it puts me in mind
[1:19:09] of a morg he said their spiritual
[1:19:12] thermometers goes 100 below
[1:19:14] zero he said they put some fluid in
[1:19:17] there and they take a taking a dead man
[1:19:19] to a mark and they take all the blood
[1:19:21] out of him and put something in there to
[1:19:24] make sure that he's
[1:19:25] dead if you want to know what
[1:19:27] denominations do that's what they're
[1:19:30] doing they're pulling the blood of Jesus
[1:19:32] Christ out and they're trying to pump
[1:19:34] something in you to keep you
[1:19:38] dead don't let Satan take the blood out
[1:19:41] of you you need this Blood you need this
[1:19:45] power don't just be a man be a God man a
[1:19:49] man of Faith a man of understanding a
[1:19:52] man of wisdom a man of the script
[1:19:57] scriptures the Book of James said it in
[1:20:00] 3:17 but the wisdom that is from above
[1:20:02] is first pure then Peaceable gentle easy
[1:20:06] to be intreated full of Mercy good
[1:20:07] fruits without partiality without
[1:20:09] hypocrisy and the fruit of righteousness
[1:20:12] is sown in peace of
[1:20:14] them that make
[1:20:20] peace I like fting too much yeah it's
[1:20:23] okay
[1:20:25] David was a man of
[1:20:28] war he is known for some of the greatest
[1:20:31] Feats throughout his his kingdom Reign
[1:20:34] and even throughout his his young
[1:20:35] adulthood he is known as having some of
[1:20:38] the Greatest Warrior moments in the
[1:20:42] Bible but in being a man of war David
[1:20:46] strove for peace his entire
[1:20:50] life because what's the what's the on
[1:20:52] the other side of War what's what's the
[1:20:54] go
[1:20:55] goal like literally what's the goal of
[1:20:58] fighting you want peace on the other
[1:21:01] side of
[1:21:02] it now to be honest we were in
[1:21:07] war for 4,000 years because Humanity can
[1:21:11] never get above the altar Humanity can
[1:21:15] never get above the Lamb of a
[1:21:17] sacrificial lamb that would die year in
[1:21:19] and die year out but we were in war but
[1:21:24] when Christ Christ came was the first
[1:21:26] time that Humanity lived in peace since
[1:21:30] the Garden of
[1:21:36] Eden if we can't live in peace and
[1:21:39] accepting him as our savior then his his
[1:21:43] accomplishments were in
[1:21:46] vain you don't have to war with your
[1:21:49] sin you don't have to war with your past
[1:21:53] you don't have to war with who you were
[1:21:55] you don't have to war with your
[1:21:57] generations of 40 generations of of this
[1:22:00] that and the other you can live in
[1:22:09] peace that
[1:22:14] quick I was talking to Brother David
[1:22:16] last
[1:22:17] week and he said something to me that
[1:22:20] astounded me
[1:22:25] don't be surprised Christina he says
[1:22:26] some astounding
[1:22:29] things he said but immediately I love
[1:22:33] this sounds his word sounded exactly
[1:22:37] like the Book of Mark Mark Mark uses the
[1:22:39] word immediately over and over and over
[1:22:41] again he said but as soon as the Lord
[1:22:45] came in life immediately he said there
[1:22:48] was peace he said I didn't fight with it
[1:22:50] no more I didn't fight with addictions I
[1:22:51] didn't I didn't fight with that that's
[1:22:54] the power of a
[1:22:57] birth when a when a when a woman is with
[1:23:00] child and she's got groanings on the
[1:23:03] inside of her that baby is at peace
[1:23:06] right here he doesn't know the world but
[1:23:10] he's going through War to get into that
[1:23:13] world but when he gets into that world
[1:23:16] he never wants to go back to that world
[1:23:20] again let me say this to you when I was
[1:23:24] born
[1:23:25] again I was one way one day but from
[1:23:28] that
[1:23:30] timeall I didn't have to war with my
[1:23:33] flesh I didn't war with my mind I didn't
[1:23:36] war with my mistakes I was at
[1:23:42] peace but before that you w with it you
[1:23:46] w with your flesh you w with your mind
[1:23:48] you wed with your
[1:23:50] spirit it was a battle but when the
[1:23:52] peace that passes all understand it
[1:23:54] comes to your life there is nothing like
[1:23:57] the Peace of almighty God because Jesus
[1:24:00] said in me you will have peace but in
[1:24:03] the world you're going to have
[1:24:04] tribulation but be of good cheer I have
[1:24:07] overcome the world Hallelujah you say I
[1:24:10] want peace in my life peace in my home
[1:24:13] peace in my marriage peace in my mind
[1:24:16] find Jesus
[1:24:24] David I'm not going to read all of it
[1:24:27] because I got some ground to cover
[1:24:29] tonight y'all happy to be in
[1:24:32] church because because David was was was
[1:24:36] striving for peace and you start reading
[1:24:39] over in 2 Samuel chapter 10 after nahas
[1:24:42] the king of the ammonites had died and
[1:24:44] and that that that King nahas had showed
[1:24:47] kindness unto David and David when he
[1:24:49] heard about nahash n you go to read all
[1:24:52] the chapter when he heard about nahash D
[1:24:55] David went there and he wanted to
[1:24:57] comfort his son Hanan he went there and
[1:25:00] he went to comfort him and show him
[1:25:02] kindness but the men that were
[1:25:05] surrounding hanun they begin to speak to
[1:25:07] him said do you really think that David
[1:25:09] the Philistine killer is really coming
[1:25:11] up here to bring peace and and to
[1:25:13] comfort you what he's doing here is to
[1:25:16] bring he's bringing spies with him he's
[1:25:18] not really coming here to comfort you
[1:25:20] and bring peace to you he's coming here
[1:25:22] to see how many armies that we got on
[1:25:24] the inside of these walls he's he's
[1:25:26] coming here to seek everything out he's
[1:25:28] he's looking but you see how amazing
[1:25:32] that the how the ammonites had misread
[1:25:34] the entire situation because David was
[1:25:37] really going there from his heart he was
[1:25:39] going there to to show them
[1:25:43] Comfort because David had had comfort in
[1:25:46] his life because when you study the life
[1:25:49] of David David's life is not always
[1:25:51] killing Giants
[1:25:54] David's life's most of his life was
[1:25:58] spent in the
[1:26:06] cave here the ammonites they they
[1:26:08] completely they had no discernment on
[1:26:10] this
[1:26:11] situation and and that and when when
[1:26:14] when Hanan sees all them he comes in
[1:26:17] there and he humiliates the children of
[1:26:19] Israel he humiliates all the Hebrews and
[1:26:21] he he cuts off their garments and shaves
[1:26:23] off all their
[1:26:24] beards and to do that to an
[1:26:28] Israelite it's a disgraceful thing
[1:26:31] because because when when when you shave
[1:26:34] off a Hebrew shave his beard
[1:26:39] off you are disgracing him because
[1:26:43] slaves because slaves walk around with
[1:26:46] clean shaven
[1:26:48] faces brother TJ and brother Matthew we
[1:26:50] recognize they're not slaves
[1:26:54] so
[1:26:55] Katie No Shave
[1:26:59] November but it
[1:27:04] really it was a disgraceful thing and
[1:27:08] when King David heard this when King
[1:27:10] David heard this he he he put them aside
[1:27:14] these Men of War he put them aside for a
[1:27:17] season until their beards grown because
[1:27:19] they literally cut their garments off to
[1:27:20] their buttocks and they shaved their
[1:27:21] face and it was such an shameful event
[1:27:24] that happened in the Hebrews life that
[1:27:26] they did not want to appear in public
[1:27:28] amen because everyone would think that
[1:27:32] they're now A
[1:27:36] Slave I got scriptures for the other
[1:27:38] side of things too but I want I'm not
[1:27:39] going there
[1:27:40] tonight but David went there for one
[1:27:44] purpose and I'll tell you what it is
[1:27:46] when when a man goes there when a man
[1:27:50] goes there for peace and you spit on him
[1:27:52] and right in the face
[1:27:54] he immediately turns from man of peace
[1:27:57] to a man of
[1:27:58] war he literally turn and when David
[1:28:01] heard these things when he heard these
[1:28:04] things he got so stirred up brother Ron
[1:28:06] he got so stirred up that he called on
[1:28:09] the Mighty Men and the and the ammonites
[1:28:13] they they recognize they wasn't able to
[1:28:15] really defeat David and all of his
[1:28:16] mighty men so they hired out some
[1:28:18] mercenaries by the name of the Syrian
[1:28:20] ites and they brought them in there and
[1:28:22] they had 33,000 men that was going to
[1:28:24] come in there and they was going to
[1:28:26] destroy
[1:28:27] David but David called on the Mighty Men
[1:28:31] and I love what the Bible when you study
[1:28:33] out what Mighty Men means it means the
[1:28:36] worthy
[1:28:37] ones you may or not think that you're
[1:28:40] worthy and you may not think that you're
[1:28:42] mighty but you don't have to call
[1:28:44] yourself that David called you that
[1:28:48] these men were elected to stand right
[1:28:51] there to be right there these were the
[1:28:54] choice
[1:28:56] men you might be a little bit
[1:28:58] intimidated by Satan and all of his
[1:29:00] power and all of his
[1:29:02] Bluffs because he's constantly breathing
[1:29:04] out lies and and constantly breathing
[1:29:07] out threatening against the Church of
[1:29:08] the Living God and and and joab which
[1:29:12] was the captain over top of the Mighty
[1:29:14] Men he was standing there and he could
[1:29:16] see there's 33,000 Syrian ites that are
[1:29:19] that are coming over here and he looked
[1:29:22] out across his army and to me
[1:29:25] what joab does he gives one of the
[1:29:28] greatest Marshall Marshal speeches
[1:29:31] that's ever been known and men have
[1:29:33] stood there and they've they've
[1:29:35] critiqued this statement they have
[1:29:37] looked over it and said what did joab do
[1:29:41] that he could bring peace to his
[1:29:43] Warriors in the midst of a battle when
[1:29:46] they were outnumbered he said be of good
[1:29:51] cheer second Samuel 10:12 be of good
[1:30:01] courage what else do you

[1:30:18] cities of our joab that's all he said
[1:30:21] you can read the rest of the chapter
[1:30:23] that's all he said be of good courage
[1:30:26] and play the part of a
[1:30:29] man that was all that they needed he
[1:30:32] didn't stand there and PR them and teach
[1:30:35] them you're this you're that he just
[1:30:37] simply said be of good courage be a man
[1:30:40] for our people and for the cities of

[1:32:40] life there's something constantly

[1:32:57] it you didn't want to do what other
[1:32:59] people did you didn't want to say words
[1:33:02] like the other kid said you don't want
[1:33:04] to listen to that kind of
[1:33:05] music because something was on the
[1:33:07] inside of
[1:33:09] you it's like old like that old Chief it
[1:33:13] said when he gave his heart to the Lord
[1:33:14] you remember I gave my heart to the Lord
[1:33:16] and he said they come and ask him said

[1:33:36] the one that Chief feeds
[1:33:40] most he's a white dog and there's a
[1:33:42] black dog on the inside of me and he
[1:33:43] said it depends which one I feed the
[1:33:46] most which one wins I know you may not
[1:33:49] believe this but I I was putting his
[1:33:51] sermon together about four weeks ago and
[1:33:53] we us boys we got out and we just got
[1:33:55] done finishing up some work and spirit
[1:33:57] of the Lord they probably didn't know
[1:33:58] what was going on but Spirit of the Lord
[1:33:59] was just dealing with me and we get out
[1:34:02] we get out of our truck and getting
[1:34:03] ready to go grab a bite to eat and God
[1:34:05] just drops that little nugget in my
[1:34:06] heart on the war within
[1:34:08] us all of a sudden around the corner of
[1:34:10] that restaurant comes a white
[1:34:12] dog I said I'll feed that
[1:34:18] one I'm not giving over to thing I'm not
[1:34:20] giving over to speculation I'm not
[1:34:22] giving over to a illusions of those

[1:38:27] yes brother Andrew you don't know about
[1:38:30] my scars you don't know about my
[1:38:32] complexes you don't know about my fears
[1:38:34] you don't know about my Wars you don't
[1:38:36] know what I'm going
[1:38:39] through I want you to glory in your
[1:38:42] scars for
[1:38:49] Christ I'm not giving you psychology but
[1:38:53] I I want you to glory in your scars and
[1:38:55] your wounds that you took for
[1:38:58] Christ every one of us are scarred up I
[1:39:01] got a scar right here on my hand it
[1:39:02] means nothing else to nobody else but to
[1:39:06] me it means
[1:39:11] something I stuck my hand through a a
[1:39:14] glass windshield one time being
[1:39:15] something real
[1:39:17] stupid doing something real
[1:39:22] stupid St see it today and every time I
[1:39:25] look at
[1:39:26] it memories flow back of what I
[1:39:30] did and it's so easy to get
[1:39:34] scarred by other
[1:39:39] Christians it's so easy to get scarred
[1:39:41] in your memory and your affections and
[1:39:45] in those
[1:39:46] channels and you constantly look at that
[1:39:48] Scar and I remember what they did and I
[1:39:51] remember how they said that and
[1:39:58] blessed are
[1:40:01] they that are persecuted for my
[1:40:06] sake instead of constantly
[1:40:09] Waring Waring with your complexes and
[1:40:13] your
[1:40:14] scars rather glory in these things
[1:40:24] how many
[1:40:25] times was Christ
[1:40:27] beat how many times did in his flesh he
[1:40:31] feel like giving up the
[1:40:36] battle but in the middle of his
[1:40:39] War he was thinking about your
[1:40:45] peace God did not give us the spirit of
[1:40:49] fear but he gave us the spirit of power
[1:40:53] of love and a sound
[1:40:57] mind you say well what are you saying
[1:40:59] glory in your scars I'm saying this that
[1:41:01] your conflict can lead you to a deeper
[1:41:05] growth on what peace truly is and that
[1:41:09] when you've got peace that peace equips
[1:41:12] you to engage in the battle more
[1:41:16] thoughtfully because if you have ever
[1:41:19] been in a
[1:41:21] war and you know what it's like to be in
[1:41:24] peace you can have peace in the middle
[1:41:27] of your
[1:41:28] War let me tell you it is a dangerous
[1:41:31] thing to deal with somebody that doesn't
[1:41:34] get hot hited in the middle of a
[1:41:38] war Homer Frasier was one bad fighter
[1:41:42] because he had a memory the size of an
[1:41:45] elephant and you never could get him mad
[1:41:48] but he could stand you could get him mad
[1:41:50] but in the midst of it when it seems
[1:41:53] like you would get hotheaded he was more
[1:41:57] collected pulled him out underneath of a
[1:41:59] tractor when it ran and he was a most
[1:42:01] collected guy pull my pistol off my side
[1:42:03] I don't want to take it to the hospital
[1:42:05] with me make sure I got my bear aspirin
[1:42:06] I got all these different things got
[1:42:08] my he was collected in the
[1:42:11] fight I tell you what it's a dangerous
[1:42:13] thing it's a dangerous thing when
[1:42:16] somebody's got perfect peace in the
[1:42:18] middle of a war when it seems like all
[1:42:21] hell's going now I tell you what I tell
[1:42:23] you what really bombards Satan is is
[1:42:26] Satan has through everything at Ron
[1:42:28] Spencer and he's constantly at peace
[1:42:30] with it I don't care whether I die
[1:42:32] tomorrow or
[1:42:34] not I'll be more alive there than I am
[1:42:37] here how that must upset Satan when he's
[1:42:40] at perfect peace whether I die or
[1:42:42] whether I go what do you do with a man
[1:42:45] that don't have give up on the inside of
[1:42:48] him but he's at peace with it
[1:42:56] brother Brandon would teach us over and
[1:42:57] over again that the right mental
[1:42:59] attitude towards any Divine promise of
[1:43:01] God will bring it to pass and whether
[1:43:03] you believe it or not keep saying it
[1:43:05] until you believe it I am healed I am
[1:43:08] delivered I am set free keep speaking
[1:43:11] until you believe it and when you
[1:43:12] believe it and accept it it's
[1:43:14] over it's over so speak the word of God
[1:43:19] put it on your mouth brother Brandon
[1:43:22] would say that a the doctor would talk
[1:43:23] to him and would tell him that if a man
[1:43:26] if a person is diagnosed with cancer and
[1:43:29] the doctor said if the person has the
[1:43:31] right mental attitude towards it he said
[1:43:33] it retards that case allog
[1:43:37] together what can you do to a Christian
[1:43:40] that lives in
[1:43:42] peace though you slay me I'm going to
[1:43:45] trust God though you rob me you take my
[1:43:49] family you take my children
[1:43:53] come on woman you speak like a foolish
[1:43:56] woman yet God slay me what are you going
[1:44:00] to do with a Christian like
[1:44:02] job in the midst of his
[1:44:06] War he was in
[1:44:13] peace I can tell I'm not going to finish
[1:44:17] this take a deep breath some of you grab
[1:44:20] your purse and get your jacket on
[1:44:23] resurrection power is
[1:44:27] coming somebody wake up your neighbor
[1:44:29] back
[1:44:31] there let me find
[1:44:35] a let me find a good F finishing
[1:44:44] spot
[1:44:45] well we'll go right here
[1:45:02] we just we'll just read these few
[1:45:07] scriptures the Bible said in Hebrews 12:
[1:45:11] 14 follow
[1:45:14] peace with all
[1:45:16] men and Holiness
[1:45:19] without and follow peace with all men
[1:45:22] and holiness
[1:45:23] without which no man shall see the Lord
[1:45:27] when you study that word follow in the
[1:45:29] Greek it means the Greek word is
[1:45:32] deo which means to persecute it means to
[1:45:35] follow after it means to run swiftly it
[1:45:39] means to make to run or to flee to put
[1:45:41] to flight to drive
[1:45:42] away so Paul is saying strive for peace
[1:45:46] with all
[1:45:47] men and Holiness without which no man
[1:45:51] shall see the Lord this the same word is
[1:45:54] is seen in Matthew 5:11 blessed are ye
[1:45:56] when men shall revile you and persecute
[1:45:58] you and shall say all manner of evil
[1:46:00] against you falsely for my sake acts 9
[1:46:03] and4 it says and he fell to the Earth
[1:46:05] and he heard a voice saying unto him
[1:46:07] Saul
[1:46:08] Saul why
[1:46:10] persecutest why
[1:46:12] strive thou with
[1:46:15] me why are you striving with me Romans
[1:46:19] 14: 19 let us therefore strive after the
[1:46:22] things
[1:46:23] which make for peace and the things
[1:46:25] wherewith one may edify another
[1:46:28] Philippians 3 and14 I press I strive
[1:46:30] towards the mark for the prize of the
[1:46:32] High Calling of God in Christ Jesus and
[1:46:35] he says three scriptures before in verse
[1:46:38] 11 if by any means I might attain unto
[1:46:42] the resurrection of the de if by any
[1:46:44] means if by no matter what I got to go
[1:46:47] through if by any means I strive for
[1:46:50] this I'm running for this
[1:46:53] no matter what I got to go through I'm
[1:46:55] going to press I'm going to
[1:46:59] battle for the High Calling of
[1:47:02] God and in Romans
[1:47:06] 12:8 and if it be possible as much as Li
[1:47:10] in you live
[1:47:12] peaceably with all
[1:47:17] men live peaceably
[1:47:22] with the ones you
[1:47:26] like live
[1:47:28] peaceably with all
[1:47:30] men I love the Prophet The Prophet
[1:47:33] taught us sometimes it's not possible to
[1:47:36] live peacefully with all
[1:47:37] men sometimes it ain't you turned the
[1:47:41] cheek one time you turn it back again
[1:47:43] and you found out it ain't Peaceable
[1:47:45] come on that's right David had went
[1:47:48] through so many and I'm going I'm going
[1:47:49] to go here next weekend but I'm I'm
[1:47:51] going to give you a preliminary David
[1:47:53] had went through so many things he
[1:47:56] sought the favor of the king when the
[1:47:58] king didn't even want
[1:48:01] him David could have had his kingdom way
[1:48:05] before Saul ever
[1:48:07] died but because he respected the
[1:48:11] anointed of the Lord he chose to live in
[1:48:14] despair in the backside of a cave and to
[1:48:18] live peaceably with King
[1:48:20] Saul rather than to dwell in the king's
[1:48:24] Palace so your suffering is not in
[1:48:29] vain the trials that you've been
[1:48:33] through are worth
[1:48:36] gold Sister Christina what you have been
[1:48:39] through to get to this
[1:48:41] spot the
[1:48:44] wars the wars the
[1:48:47] battles It's Time For
[1:48:50] Peace yes Lord It's Time for
[1:48:53] peace and now now I don't want to just
[1:48:56] speak that to
[1:48:58] her but I want to speak that to
[1:49:00] Gabriel because I was in my study and I
[1:49:03] kept seeing you
[1:49:05] today I kept seeing you and and I so I
[1:49:09] want to just speak this I just want to
[1:49:11] say this let's have some
[1:49:14] peace let's have some War let I know
[1:49:17] we're in the middle of a war I know
[1:49:18] Israel's in the middle of a war I know
[1:49:20] that they're fighting with Iran and they
[1:49:22] they are constantly bombarding Iran and
[1:49:24] they're sending out Jets and they're
[1:49:26] sending out Wars and they're sending out
[1:49:28] bombs why is Israel doing that because
[1:49:32] they want peace in their Homeland
[1:49:34] because they believe that's theirs and I
[1:49:37] believe that you believe that your
[1:49:39] family is everything to you that here in
[1:49:42] this world that you ought to be able to
[1:49:44] live to a place that you can have your
[1:49:46] inheritance that you can have your right
[1:49:49] mind that you can have good health
[1:49:53] come
[1:49:54] on you see other people live good
[1:49:57] lives how about
[1:50:00] you I'm not just talking about
[1:50:02] Prosperity I'm talking about nice homes
[1:50:04] but I'm talking about peace I'm talking
[1:50:06] about being able to say it Is Well with
[1:50:08] My
[1:50:10] Soul when hosio spafford when he was
[1:50:14] standing out there when he watched his
[1:50:15] mother watched the mother of his
[1:50:17] children had had died out there in the
[1:50:20] middle of the ship in the middle of the
[1:50:23] ocean he stood out there and said I want
[1:50:25] to know where they died at and when he
[1:50:28] stood right
[1:50:30] there in the middle of his
[1:50:33] War he pinned these
[1:50:40] words
[1:50:42] hallelujah
[1:50:46] hallelujah let the Billows
[1:50:48] roll let them roll over me but let me
[1:50:52] have my peace because I can say it Is
[1:50:55] Well with My
[1:50:59] Soul what if you get diagnosed with this
[1:51:01] what if your family leaves you what if
[1:51:02] you're the only one left in your F there
[1:51:04] are people sitting all around this
[1:51:06] message that are the only ones in their
[1:51:10] family that believe this
[1:51:15] message but they wouldn't trade the
[1:51:17] world's love for the peace that they
[1:51:19] have
[1:51:23] let me tell you something you heard me
[1:51:25] tell this before but I was offered I was
[1:51:28] offered multi-million dollar money to go
[1:51:31] out and do the same thing that I do on a
[1:51:33] everyday basis I was offered it to just
[1:51:37] go do it for another
[1:51:40] company more money than I would ever
[1:51:43] make in my lifetime I couldn't make in
[1:51:44] five
[1:51:45] years maybe less than
[1:51:48] that but I kept riding back up that road
[1:51:52] and I could not find no peace I could
[1:51:55] find no peace in that money I could find
[1:51:57] no peace in flying on the private jet
[1:51:59] from here and there I could find no
[1:52:01] peace in it but where I found peace at
[1:52:03] is being able to save you and help you
[1:52:06] and be able to go out
[1:52:08] there to go out there and to preach the
[1:52:11] gospel here and preach the gospel there
[1:52:14] I found no peace in money but I found
[1:52:18] peace in the message of the hour
[1:52:23] I didn't give up everything for this
[1:52:26] message but I gave up who I was for this
[1:52:29] message money does not mean more to me
[1:52:34] than you
[1:52:37] do my goal is not money my goal is not a
[1:52:41] bigger Church my goal is to get you in a
[1:52:46] Rapture I don't care whether you hate my
[1:52:49] guts at the end of this journey or not
[1:52:51] but if I see you on that side I will
[1:52:54] live in
[1:53:05] peace what Satan offers you is not worth
[1:53:14] it Bethany Lawson Hatfield could have
[1:53:17] sold her a gift to the
[1:53:19] world and she could have retained money
[1:53:22] and contracts and all those
[1:53:24] things but for this
[1:53:26] gospel Homer Fraser could have been a a
[1:53:29] folk country
[1:53:31] singer had the Charisma to go with it
[1:53:34] but he gave
[1:53:35] all of his Ambitions up for the Peace of
[1:53:40] the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:53:44] amen where do you find peace
