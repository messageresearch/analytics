[50:56] good to us if you will turn with us to 1
[50:59] Thessalonians chapter 5 this morning and
[51:02] verse 1 down through verse n amen I'd
[51:06] like to continue the thought of what we
[51:08] had last week and uh maybe that was just
[51:12] a little bit of a different way of
[51:13] looking at it a Return to Eden even all
[51:17] nature is going to be returned and
[51:18] restored and all the animal kingdom will
[51:20] be restored and and then and then you
[51:24] and I are are being and restored but I'd
[51:26] like to kind of continue that thought of
[51:29] God's Gathering if we can do that 1
[51:32] Thessalonians chapter 5 and verse
[51:35] one amen but of the times and the
[51:38] seasons Brethren you have no need that I
[51:40] write unto you and of course he's just
[51:42] written chapter 4 where we talk about
[51:45] the Rapture for yourselves know
[51:48] perfectly that the day of the Lord so
[51:50] cometh as a thief in the night for when
[51:53] they shall say peace and safy then
[51:55] sudden destruction cometh upon them as
[51:58] travail upon the woman with a child and
[52:01] they shall not Escape but ye Brethren
[52:03] are not in darkness that that day should
[52:06] overtake you as a thief ye are all the
[52:09] children of of the light and the
[52:11] children of the day were not of the
[52:14] night nor of the darkness aren't you
[52:16] thankful for
[52:19] that God is writing this about you
[52:23] amen you are all children of the light
[52:27] and Children of the day were not of the
[52:30] night nor of
[52:33] Darkness that ought to make us all shout
[52:35] right there therefore let us not sleep
[52:38] as do others but let us watch and be
[52:41] sober for they that sleep sleep in the
[52:45] night and they that are drunken are
[52:48] drunken in the night but let us who are
[52:51] of the day be sober putting on the
[52:54] breastplate of faith faith and love and
[52:57] for a helmet and the hope of Salvation I
[53:00] want us to read this last verse together
[53:03] for God hath not appoint us to wrath but
[53:07] to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus
[53:11] Christ you may be
[53:17] seated can I just say this to you
[53:19] everything is in
[53:22] order everything is in order there's
[53:25] nothing out of place the things that you
[53:28] and I are seeing just before the
[53:30] tribulation period that is setting in
[53:33] these things must be even our nation our
[53:37] our our white house last night was
[53:39] attacked and and even there's bombs
[53:43] dropping in many different places in the
[53:45] Middle East and new people that are
[53:48] getting into the the arena of the last
[53:52] move and so we realize that that that
[53:55] could not happen until God allowed
[54:00] it I want you to catch that until God
[54:03] allowed it a lot of people have a lot of
[54:06] different thoughts and a lot of
[54:08] Ambitions and a lot of wars that they'd
[54:10] like to get involved in but the Angels
[54:12] stand
[54:15] guard and amen and the only way that
[54:18] they can be doing what they're doing is
[54:21] you and I are in a place amen
[54:25] of going
[54:27] home I you know as I look at the year
[54:30] and we've got a lot of things that are
[54:32] that are planning for the year and
[54:34] things that I'm planning for the year
[54:36] and I actually plan and make goals for
[54:40] myself and I call it to live for and and
[54:44] uh things that I'm going to do and
[54:46] things I'm trying to to to because your
[54:49] mind's got to be that way but I would
[54:51] have to say this to you as I look at the
[54:54] year coming there's a lot of things I
[54:56] don't think we're going to get to
[54:58] do because I feel like the Rapture is so
[55:02] at hand amen
[55:05] now there's a song that is said this is
[55:08] the evening
[55:10] time it is later than you
[55:13] think the bride is preparing now for our
[55:18] Lord to
[55:19] meet I don't know if you guys have that
[55:21] up up there and I'd like to just read
[55:24] those words and I may have I may have
[55:28] just quoted them
[55:31] but is it there all right if you find it
[55:36] if you find it it's fine amen
[55:41] amen last week we spoke about when Noah
[55:45] had preached for 120
[55:48] years sin had came on the World to such
[55:52] a point till God repented that he even
[55:55] made
[55:57] man so we know that the Earth is just
[56:02] like you and I it has to be washed for
[56:05] him to redeem the Earth Back to Eden
[56:08] he's got to wash it then he's got to
[56:11] come and bleed on
[56:14] it right so when his blood was Dripping
[56:18] on the cross it his body had came from
[56:22] the cursed earth right
[56:26] when Mary ate his body he was God but
[56:29] when he ate she ate his body it came out
[56:32] of the cursed Earth all of the potassium
[56:35] and the potash and all of the elements
[56:38] of the earth that was placed into his
[56:40] body he was not only redeeming you and I
[56:43] but he was redeeming this
[56:46] Earth and now there's going to come a
[56:49] baptism of
[56:51] fire are you with me God washed it how
[56:56] many seen a
[56:57] rainbow but God made a covenant when he
[57:00] washed the Earth I'll never destroy the
[57:03] Earth again by
[57:05] water I think of all of these crazy
[57:07] people that says that it never happened
[57:10] Noah's flood never
[57:11] happened what about that
[57:15] rainbow is that just a natural
[57:18] phenomena or is that God's Bible in the
[57:21] heavens reminding us
[57:25] and and let me just say this you when
[57:27] God does a work in you he don't just do
[57:29] a part and then just just stop at
[57:33] you he's got a
[57:36] plan and if you remember he preached for
[57:39] 120 years let me just say the critics
[57:44] they had to be there oh the scoffers had
[57:47] to be there you know and we've came
[57:50] through the time period of this message
[57:52] to where that believe the sign took
[57:55] place and people walked away and people
[57:57] scoffed the message but they also were
[58:00] scoffing the Bible that's right they
[58:02] wasn't just scoffing the ministry or
[58:04] even brother brandham but they were
[58:06] scoffing the Bible because the message
[58:09] came from the Bible and so and and so as
[58:12] you come you you notice that they had
[58:15] that had to be they had to do their
[58:17] thing and but no doubt if you were
[58:20] sitting in Noah's day you were thinking
[58:23] it's never rained
[58:27] before it's never rained before and this
[58:30] man's prophesying that it's going to
[58:32] rain he's telling us that the Earth is
[58:34] going to be destroyed by
[58:38] water it's more than a bridge and it's
[58:41] more than a cloud and
[58:44] it's are you with me now and so they
[58:46] were just constantly scoffing but I want
[58:50] to ask you now did it
[58:53] happen
[58:55] and and let me just say this you God's
[58:57] timing is
[58:59] perfect we as human beings we get in a
[59:02] hurry we're constantly thinking about
[59:04] the season and the time and the and
[59:07] listen the Rapture could not happen in
[59:12] 77 well well well prove it brother Ron
[59:15] how many of you got born again after
[59:22] 77 I know it's Sunday morning but how
[59:24] many of you were born again after
[59:29] 1977 look at all those
[59:32] hands you were on his
[59:36] mind and the scripture says I'll not
[59:39] lose a
[59:43] one are you with me now I'll not lose a
[59:47] one so I want you to just notice there
[59:49] Comes A Time and there comes a season
[59:51] now not Noah could not go go gather
[59:55] those
[59:57] animals he had been responsible for
[1:00:00] building and been responsible for
[1:00:03] preaching for 120 years and now he
[1:00:07] himself doesn't know the
[1:00:10] season he doesn't know the season even
[1:00:14] that he's in he's preaching he's
[1:00:16] preaching he's preaching nobody but his
[1:00:18] family is gathering but now there's a
[1:00:21] season that is happening to where animal
[1:00:24] two by
[1:00:27] two two by two begin to gather toward
[1:00:31] the ark I want to ask you what
[1:00:37] intelligence moved on those animals to
[1:00:45] migrate two by two something moved and
[1:00:49] no doubt there was millions of that type
[1:00:52] of an
[1:00:53] animal millions of those type of an
[1:00:56] animal but two by two male and female
[1:01:00] begin to move toward the
[1:01:04] ark don't tell me God don't know how to
[1:01:07] operate those animals begin to move
[1:01:09] toward the ark and if you could talk to
[1:01:12] them and ask Mr giraffe what are you
[1:01:15] doing there's something in
[1:01:17] me Mr lion there's something in
[1:01:22] me Mr by B there's something in
[1:01:29] me you remember brother Kelly that's 37
[1:01:34] below zero this
[1:01:36] morning aren't you glad aren't you glad
[1:01:39] you're here in Edmonton it's 41 below
[1:01:44] zero and so and so up there in Brother
[1:01:47] Kelly's Country it's called a a
[1:01:50] Flyway and those geese are up there and
[1:01:54] and they'll they'll live through the
[1:01:55] summer and they'll live through the
[1:01:57] spring and the fall and all of a sudden
[1:01:59] something will begin to move on the
[1:02:01] inside of
[1:02:03] them there's something there's an
[1:02:06] Intelligence on the inside of them let
[1:02:09] me just capture the intelligence that
[1:02:11] I'm talking about brother brandom is
[1:02:13] standing with an
[1:02:16] Infidel in bloody clothes and they've
[1:02:19] been hunting and and and he's standing
[1:02:21] there and and and they've been hunting
[1:02:23] and brother Woods is with him and the
[1:02:26] Infidel has been talking to him he don't
[1:02:28] believe in God and and and brother
[1:02:30] Randon picks up an
[1:02:32] apple asked the man can I have an apple
[1:02:35] and he said well the yellow jackets are
[1:02:37] going to eat them up you may as well eat
[1:02:38] one and he and he looked and he said
[1:02:40] what intelligence is telling that tree
[1:02:42] it's August what intelligence is telling
[1:02:45] that tree to start start the sack to go
[1:02:49] back to the ground and the leaves are
[1:02:50] starting to tell turn colors amen right
[1:02:56] and brother Brandon begins to talk about
[1:02:58] the intelligence that is in nature
[1:03:02] right are you with me now the
[1:03:05] intelligence that's in nature of course
[1:03:07] you and I know that that man there's a
[1:03:09] miracle just happened a miracle just
[1:03:12] happened over on the hillside a woman
[1:03:14] dying and somebody took a took a prayer
[1:03:16] cloth and went and brother Brandon
[1:03:18] praise over that they come and lay it on
[1:03:21] her and she's well
[1:03:23] overnight and he's wanting to talk to
[1:03:26] the
[1:03:27] preacher the preacher that that is that
[1:03:31] is that has prayed for that woman being
[1:03:34] an Infidel there's something still in
[1:03:36] his mind that there's
[1:03:38] God and so happened God migrates the
[1:03:44] prophet and he's standing in front of
[1:03:47] him an
[1:03:50] Infidel that lived that way all of his
[1:03:53] life
[1:03:57] that lived that way all of his life
[1:03:58] thinking that way all of his life of all
[1:04:01] the people on the Earth that
[1:04:03] predestinated seed standing on the
[1:04:08] porch
[1:04:11] right brother Brown was talking about
[1:04:13] the in the intelligence of God in a
[1:04:19] tree and he leads that man to Christ am
[1:04:23] an infidel
[1:04:27] I think about this
[1:04:29] message and how incredible it
[1:04:33] is I just want to share a few things
[1:04:35] that's on my
[1:04:37] heart I think about all the
[1:04:41] schools and all the intelligence all the
[1:04:44] way down through the seven Church
[1:04:46] ages that God took this
[1:04:50] book and he hid it from the greatest
[1:04:54] Minds in the
[1:04:58] world he he hid the Seven
[1:05:01] Seals he hid the
[1:05:04] trumpets he hid he hid the
[1:05:07] Thunders but he was going to send a
[1:05:09] messenger here that wouldn't finish
[1:05:15] school that would be from
[1:05:18] Kentucky that would be a man that he
[1:05:21] would begin to deal with at a very young
[1:05:23] age
[1:05:24] and he would have to get him so
[1:05:27] surrendered to the point to where that
[1:05:30] he wouldn't preach his own
[1:05:32] mind and he would remind us you're not
[1:05:35] feeding on the words of a man but you're
[1:05:38] feeding on the body word of the son of
[1:05:41] man now there's no better one to reveal
[1:05:46] the book than the one that wrote
[1:05:51] it now think about the man age
[1:05:54] you know some of the greatest literary
[1:05:57] students in the world is on the scene
[1:05:59] under John Wesley and Knox and Calvin
[1:06:02] and pheny even Spurgeon these are some
[1:06:05] of the greatest intellect speakers that
[1:06:08] there are in the world but God hid the
[1:06:11] Seven
[1:06:14] Seals brother brandom even makes mention
[1:06:16] to us this is important to you now he
[1:06:20] makes mention to us that before before
[1:06:23] the SE he says before he came
[1:06:26] Revelations 10:1 before he
[1:06:29] came they were only
[1:06:33] probing and he even uses the word
[1:06:37] guessing that's right I'll take brother
[1:06:40] ROM's good guess over top of all the
[1:06:43] theologians but anyway they were just
[1:06:46] probing and he comes up to the church
[1:06:48] ages and he takes us through the church
[1:06:50] ages and take us through each messenger
[1:06:54] and who they
[1:06:55] are there's not another
[1:06:58] speaker I was thinking this morning as
[1:07:00] sister Connie is playing what you ask us
[1:07:02] to play this morning and brother
[1:07:04] brandham says more in a
[1:07:08] paragraph than most tele evangelists
[1:07:10] will say in a
[1:07:14] year so never let us take it for
[1:07:18] granted and here here brother brandom is
[1:07:21] speaking and you know and and he he's
[1:07:25] speaking and he's just going and he's
[1:07:27] going and he's laying out sermons the
[1:07:29] Hebrew series and Corinthians and and
[1:07:32] Jehovah Gyra and he's taking us through
[1:07:35] but there comes a
[1:07:38] junction there comes a junction to where
[1:07:41] that now I got to speak to the bride
[1:07:44] there's a third pull of first and second
[1:07:47] it came and and everybody was attached
[1:07:49] to that but now they're going to say he
[1:07:51] got off that's right
[1:07:54] but it's not to the
[1:07:56] world it's to the Bride of Jesus
[1:08:02] Christ and so it comes up to a certain
[1:08:05] point it's he'll use a term called a
[1:08:07] Chasm there's a great Chasm that will
[1:08:09] come between the church
[1:08:11] ages and the release of the
[1:08:14] word and Christ himself will come to the
[1:08:19] messenger and the Messenger will be
[1:08:22] begin to speak and the Thunders are the
[1:08:27] are the word that has been preached for
[1:08:29] seven Church ages but they're
[1:08:34] uninterpreted and they themselves can't
[1:08:36] even understand let me just take for an
[1:08:38] instance
[1:08:40] justification and brother Brandon brings
[1:08:42] it up especially in the visible Union of
[1:08:44] the bride and he said he said it's as
[1:08:47] though you never did it in the first
[1:08:52] place thank you Lord
[1:08:54] that's right and the reason I'm going
[1:08:57] there is because this is very important
[1:08:59] so many times your
[1:09:03] enemy that you fight takes the book of
[1:09:10] memory and takes the book of memory and
[1:09:13] begins to beat you over and over and
[1:09:16] over again things that you only know
[1:09:20] about maybe your spouses don't even know
[1:09:23] about
[1:09:24] only you deep within your heart know
[1:09:28] about you can use the term skeletons in
[1:09:31] the closet or this or that or things
[1:09:34] that you never want to be brought back
[1:09:35] up but let me just say this you not even
[1:09:40] got after the blood is applied not even
[1:09:45] God looks at those
[1:09:49] [Applause]
[1:09:52] things
[1:09:57] and here Luther is bringing us from
[1:10:00] Catholicism and he's beginning to preach
[1:10:02] the just shall live by
[1:10:06] faith I want you I want to just I'm
[1:10:08] sorry may I may take a little longer
[1:10:10] today but let me just say this you in
[1:10:13] that day they were selling
[1:10:16] prayers you had to confess to a
[1:10:21] priest are you with me there was
[1:10:22] purgatory that was being taught the
[1:10:25] Bible wasn't even in this
[1:10:28] form most people was not allowed to read
[1:10:31] the
[1:10:33] book and God takes one scripture to this
[1:10:37] messenger and he stands there and begins
[1:10:40] to preach we don't need paid
[1:10:43] prayers you don't need to be under
[1:10:46] Catholicism you
[1:10:49] don't no man has the right to be your
[1:10:52] judge
[1:10:55] I paid the price of redemption when I
[1:10:58] justify you it's as though you never did
[1:11:01] it in the first
[1:11:09] place listen this bride is not like Ruth
[1:11:13] and
[1:11:14] Rahab right she's not like Esther and
[1:11:17] she's not like all of them they're all
[1:11:20] tips they're all tips but when God
[1:11:24] washes this
[1:11:26] bride she is
[1:11:30] Virgin cuz God cannot attach himself to
[1:11:33] a harlot he makes you
[1:11:40] [Music]
[1:11:49] recreated have you got that so
[1:11:51] far I want you to get it
[1:11:54] CU it'll help you
[1:11:57] tomorrow it'll help you next
[1:12:00] week don't tell me I don't know where
[1:12:02] I'm
[1:12:03] at I know 100% sure that the accuser of
[1:12:07] the Brethren accuses every one of
[1:12:12] you and he tells you that you're not
[1:12:17] worthy he tells you that you're not
[1:12:22] qualified he tells you that this message
[1:12:25] is too deep and and too high for you to
[1:12:29] attain it come
[1:12:32] on well let me just remind you just as
[1:12:35] those animals were
[1:12:39] gathered I wish I could preach what I'm
[1:12:41] feeling just as those animals were
[1:12:44] gathered God gathered
[1:12:47] [Applause]
[1:12:52] you
[1:12:56] you didn't deposit the seed on the
[1:12:58] inside of you God deposited that and
[1:13:03] when God says I'll not lose a
[1:13:06] one than
[1:13:08] Lord I want you to just think about this
[1:13:10] for a moment all that you've been
[1:13:12] through Satan trying to destroy you
[1:13:15] because of the
[1:13:16] seat you can't see the light around you
[1:13:20] but Satan can see it why don't he go
[1:13:22] pick on a drunk or a prostitute or or
[1:13:25] some church member but he picks on you
[1:13:27] over and over cuz you got
[1:13:32] something you got a predestinated seed
[1:13:36] that is
[1:13:38] [Applause]
[1:13:50] eternal brother Ron you don't know where
[1:13:52] I've been I I don't want to know am you
[1:13:55] don't know what I've been through I
[1:13:57] don't want to
[1:14:00] know you don't know what all the
[1:14:03] mistakes that I've made and how
[1:14:05] horrendous it's
[1:14:08] been
[1:14:11] okay you got here didn't
[1:14:16] you some of you have no idea who your
[1:14:19] father
[1:14:22] is
[1:14:24] you have no
[1:14:28] idea in the Old Testament an
[1:14:30] illegitimate couldn't come back into the
[1:14:32] congregation for 400
[1:14:36] years but this
[1:14:40] blood can so wash the curse from your
[1:14:47] life you don't need to get a DNA I'm
[1:14:49] just you don't have to go get a DNA test
[1:14:52] you don't have have to go and search
[1:14:54] your
[1:14:55] family the 400-year curse does not even
[1:15:00] [Applause]
[1:15:22] apply bless Lord I think predestination
[1:15:26] is such a powerful
[1:15:30] statement for those that have been here
[1:15:32] a while you know that I love
[1:15:36] predestination notice the scripture says
[1:15:38] for God hath not appointed
[1:15:41] us to
[1:15:43] wrath brother Chris and why do we
[1:15:52] worry
[1:15:54] it doesn't matter where our family come
[1:15:56] from doesn't matter a situation well
[1:15:59] brother Ron but my family is a mess yeah
[1:16:02] but you're
[1:16:05] not you may have come out of total
[1:16:09] chaos and it really wasn't even your
[1:16:12] choice that's
[1:16:15] right it really wasn't your
[1:16:18] choice but God rich in
[1:16:21] mercy God in Mercy watched over that
[1:16:28] seed notice this for God hath not
[1:16:31] appointed us to
[1:16:33] wrath notice notice another verse
[1:16:36] Jeremiah 1 and verse5 before I formed
[1:16:39] thee in the
[1:16:41] belly I knew
[1:16:45] thee and before thou camest forth out of
[1:16:48] the womb I Sanctified
[1:16:52] thee Hallelujah now he's speaking of a
[1:16:54] prophet but he's not just speaking of a
[1:16:56] prophet he's also speaking of the
[1:16:58] predestinated
[1:17:03] SE well brother Ron I came from a of a
[1:17:06] night one night where my mom was drunk
[1:17:09] and she got with a drunken man I don't
[1:17:10] know who her father my father is even
[1:17:13] about God
[1:17:15] does God watched over your
[1:17:21] seed are you with me but brother Ron
[1:17:23] I've made so many mistakes in my life
[1:17:25] think about it before you ever got
[1:17:28] here your lineage be which you could not
[1:17:32] have any control
[1:17:35] over think about it I I'm going deep
[1:17:38] with you think about it you think about
[1:17:40] you think about your mistakes that youve
[1:17:43] made from 10 years old to 40 years old
[1:17:46] and you whip yourself over and over
[1:17:47] again let me just take you before 10 to
[1:17:50] 40 back when your generation ations were
[1:17:53] going on you had no control over
[1:17:56] it but God was watching over your seed
[1:18:00] all the way down knowing that you had to
[1:18:02] be
[1:18:06] born cuz he's got a
[1:18:09] book I'll not lose
[1:18:11] one the Rapture can't happen till every
[1:18:14] one of them get
[1:18:17] there this is more than a thief on the
[1:18:21] cross I don't know where that last one
[1:18:24] will come in but they're
[1:18:27] coming they're coming they're on their
[1:18:31] [Applause]
[1:18:51] way now want I want to just lay
[1:18:53] something real close here this isn't a
[1:18:56] temporary
[1:19:00] feeling this isn't like a presidential
[1:19:03] in the white house where you change
[1:19:06] administrations and they they undo
[1:19:09] everything the guy did four years before
[1:19:12] and they redo it all and America becomes
[1:19:14] a different Nation we're going to make
[1:19:16] her great again we're going to do all
[1:19:17] you ain't going to do
[1:19:21] nothing we got our all in a huff and
[1:19:24] puff about politics and it's a the devil
[1:19:27] I want to point your eyes to a different
[1:19:35] Kingdom I don't mind you praying for
[1:19:38] America that she comes back again I
[1:19:40] don't mind all of those I want to live
[1:19:42] in peace I want to live in happiness I
[1:19:44] want to live in a good civilization as
[1:19:46] long as we're here but this is not my
[1:19:51] home this is only
[1:19:58] temporary let's remember that our
[1:20:01] accuser can only work on our temporary
[1:20:05] existence
[1:20:09] right I want you to get
[1:20:11] that so I can't do it with this book let
[1:20:14] me do it this book okay he has a book of
[1:20:17] your old old
[1:20:21] Deeds you don't want nobody to read that
[1:20:23] book you don't want even your wife to
[1:20:26] you definitely don't want your
[1:20:29] kids but when God saved you and he
[1:20:32] washed you and he raised you up and you
[1:20:34] become adopted Sons and Daughters of God
[1:20:38] this book don't
[1:20:51] matter
[1:20:55] let me just give you a little insight
[1:20:56] how this
[1:21:00] works and myself as a pastor I'm not a
[1:21:07] micromanager I'm not going to I'm not I
[1:21:11] I could care less what kind of car you
[1:21:16] drive I I'm not interested even in what
[1:21:19] house that you live in even what job I
[1:21:22] I'm only interested in you
[1:21:26] overcoming so when you have a tiff with
[1:21:29] your wife all I'll do is pray for
[1:21:33] you I don't even want to
[1:21:36] know when you got a tiff with one
[1:21:39] another I don't want to
[1:21:43] know I I I I don't want to
[1:21:46] know well brother Ron you're supposed to
[1:21:48] leave 99 and go get to one let me just
[1:21:51] say this let me give you a real
[1:21:53] revelation of 9 and9 and go and get
[1:21:57] one if I have to come get you I'm going
[1:21:59] to have to break your
[1:22:03] legs do you really want me to break your
[1:22:08] legs pull you up against myself and hold
[1:22:12] you and micromanage you for the next
[1:22:15] year till we eat
[1:22:19] you it's a really good scripture 99 and
[1:22:22] go get the one but think about the
[1:22:24] repercussions we eat you next
[1:22:35] year it's real sweet it's real
[1:22:40] sweet but the principle of that is I got
[1:22:43] to break your legs so you don't run off
[1:22:49] again I'm preaching scripture I'm
[1:22:51] preaching script
[1:22:54] are you with me so don't get a drama
[1:22:57] class with
[1:22:59] me I won't break your legs until God
[1:23:02] tells me to break
[1:23:09] them most people's
[1:23:12] problems is because they make them
[1:23:15] that's
[1:23:21] right
[1:23:23] when that book is
[1:23:24] sealed and God seals it away Justified
[1:23:28] as though you never did it in the first
[1:23:30] place Tara can I use you just for a
[1:23:34] moment God spoke to me publicly in this
[1:23:39] audience to speak to Steve and tell him
[1:23:43] not to worry is that right she's on the
[1:23:48] way let me just say this you I've ate
[1:23:50] with you guys i' I've ate at dinner with
[1:23:52] you guys guys and I've never came to
[1:23:54] your
[1:23:54] home and you've never told me your
[1:24:00] history Ain that right can you just
[1:24:02] raise your hand for the visible
[1:24:04] audience but God told me you were
[1:24:08] coming now to the outside audience that
[1:24:10] looks down they go well she must have
[1:24:12] been there
[1:24:14] forever and brother Ron had to do some
[1:24:17] heavy cleaning to get her like she is oh
[1:24:19] no the seed that was deposited on the
[1:24:22] inside of her when she began to eat on
[1:24:26] the word her dress code changed her
[1:24:29] attitude changed her thoughts
[1:24:32] [Applause]
[1:24:40] changed I don't need to know nothing
[1:24:42] about the
[1:24:44] book and neither should she in her
[1:24:46] living room or wherever talk about the
[1:24:49] book it's
[1:24:51] done
[1:24:55] it's
[1:24:56] done it's over it's
[1:24:59] [Applause]
[1:25:06] forgiven brother Donnie Nicholson he's

[1:25:11] ask him for permission brother Donnie
[1:25:13] Nicholson that's that is a phenomenal
[1:25:17] bass player he could have you remember
[1:25:19] the night that I said brother Donnie I I

[1:25:27] standing here at the pull pit and he's
[1:25:30] standing there how many remembers this
[1:25:32] night that I'm talking about and I said
[1:25:34] you know brother Donnie could be out in
[1:25:36] the world playing music and making money
[1:25:38] and doing all of these different kind of
[1:25:40] things and brother Donnie just pipes up
[1:25:42] and said well I may tell
[1:25:44] you I just got called this week they
[1:25:46] wanted me to go back and play
[1:25:50] music I didn't know that that God knew
[1:25:55] that the first time I met brother Donnie
[1:25:57] was at his aunt's
[1:26:02] funeral and God spoke to me matter of
[1:26:05] fact they wanted me to help preach
[1:26:07] it you remember that sister Nancy you

[1:26:23] I really should have but anyway I just
[1:26:26] sat and listened to the sermon and God
[1:26:28] spoke to me when brother Donnie was
[1:26:30] playing he struming his guitar said
[1:26:32] he'll be in your
[1:26:34] church I didn't think
[1:26:37] that but God thought
[1:26:41] that brother Donnie excuse me just give
[1:26:44] me a little leeway
[1:26:46] here I know that he has an incredible
[1:26:51] past I think we all got a good knowledge

[1:26:56] the military has a family in Germany has
[1:26:59] a has a family here he's got a
[1:27:03] history but think about God and His
[1:27:05] Infinite
[1:27:08] Mercy while he was doing all of that
[1:27:13] nonsense he can't undo a thing
[1:27:16] yesterday but God in his eternal

[1:38:46] eagle and I'm talking to brother Donnie
[1:38:49] about the situation that I'm doing with
[1:38:50] m Matthew and he told me exactly what
[1:38:53] God put on my heart he said it's the
[1:38:56] mind of God brother
[1:39:01] Ron so I contacted brother Donnie Reagan
[1:39:04] he'll probably listen to this I
[1:39:05] contacted brother Donnie Reagan about
[1:39:07] what had happened he said that's exactly
[1:39:09] what I've told
[1:39:13] you well brother Ron I don't know how
[1:39:15] all that works

[1:39:25] dog everybody ought to have
[1:39:27] one and it don't lose hair but it grows
[1:39:30] hair really big time I bought trimmers I
[1:39:34] bought everything I bought scissors I
[1:39:36] bought all these things and and you know

[1:40:01] in the cart it's
[1:40:04] $22.18 I just put it in a
[1:40:07] cart an hour and a half later the Lord

[1:40:14] ordered are in your garage in the file
[1:40:19] cabinet in the top drawer under some

[1:48:13] nature the wolf and the lamb shall feed
[1:48:19] together
[1:48:22] I want you to read this verse with me
[1:48:24] the wolf and the lamb shall feed
[1:48:28] together and the lion shall eat straw
[1:48:32] like the
[1:48:33] Bullock and dust shall be the Serpent's
[1:48:36] meat they shall not hurt nor destroy in
[1:48:40] all my Holy Mountain sayeth the
[1:48:44] Lord it's quite a lot to take in right
[1:48:48] there I want you to think about from
[1:48:50] where we are to where we're
[1:48:53] going when God made a lion he made the
[1:48:56] male to be a male and he made the female
[1:49:00] to be a female don't get offended at me
[1:49:03] this is brother brandham brother
[1:49:05] brandham said that male is so beautiful
[1:49:07] and so strong and he's a male
[1:49:11] dominion and in his male
[1:49:13] domain he has never changed in his look
[1:49:20] since the Garden of
[1:49:21] Eden nor the
[1:49:24] female but in the fall he became a
[1:49:28] predator that's
[1:49:31] right now man stood in in the Garden of
[1:49:34] Eden in perfect Paradise but when he
[1:49:38] fell all of perversion be to come in on
[1:49:41] the male
[1:49:43] animal let me just remind you we're an
[1:49:46] animal without the Holy
[1:49:49] Ghost
[1:49:52] we're an animal from where we talked
[1:49:54] about just in the last little bit in
[1:49:56] your old book you did those things
[1:49:58] because of your animalistic
[1:50:01] nature the First Union of your first man
[1:50:05] God had to divorce you from that nature
[1:50:08] and you had to die to
[1:50:10] it you had to die to it but watch as we
[1:50:14] come through Sodom and gomorah even now
[1:50:17] men don't know who they are
[1:50:21] women don't know who they
[1:50:25] are men with hair weigh down their back
[1:50:28] and skinny jeans on and don't send me
[1:50:31] letters I'm telling you the
[1:50:34] truth men has lost their identity of
[1:50:36] being a real
[1:50:38] man that don't need to be in the message
[1:50:42] either we don't know need some pretty
[1:50:45] boy boy that don't know what kind
[1:50:48] of bathroom he needs to be
[1:51:00] in women you think about brother Brandon
[1:51:02] when his his Soul's now in prison what
[1:51:04] he sees in the canker over the eyes and
[1:51:07] all the jewelry on everywhere else and
[1:51:09] sees all of those different kinds of
[1:51:14] things and he remembers what he saw in
[1:51:17] Hell Yeah amen why did he preach so
[1:51:21] strong and why do we preach so strong we
[1:51:23] don't want you to go to
[1:51:25] hell and let me just say this you I
[1:51:28] don't want to send nobody to Hell listen
[1:51:31] even God don't send you to hell you go
[1:51:33] on your
[1:51:35] own your choices take you there your
[1:51:38] attitude takes you
