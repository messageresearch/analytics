[46:02] Jesus Christ amen and amen if you have
[46:06] your Bibles this evening we'd like to
[46:08] look over two portions of scripture in 2
[46:11] Kings chapter 2 and verse 14 and Malachi
[46:15] CH 4 verse 5
[46:35] 2 Kings chapter 2 and verse
[46:45] 14 and say Amen when you have it this
[46:48] evening and he took the mantel of Elijah
[46:52] that fell from him and smoke the waters
[46:55] and said where is the Lord God of
[46:59] Elijah and when he had also smitten in
[47:01] the waters they parted hither and
[47:04] thither and Elisha went over also
[47:07] Malachi CH 4 verse
[47:13] 5 behold I will send you Elijah the
[47:17] prophet before the coming of the great
[47:19] and Dreadful day of the Lord and he
[47:22] shall turn the heart of the fathers to
[47:24] the
[47:25] children and the heart of the children
[47:28] to their fathers lest I come and smite
[47:31] the Earth with a curse may God bless his
[47:33] word you may be seated in the presence
[47:36] of the Lord I'd like to speak to you
[47:38] tonight on a it's a very broad topic but
[47:40] I would like to by the help of the Lord
[47:43] just take a little little thought here
[47:45] tonight on the god of Elijah the god of
[47:49] Elijah and as as I Was preparing brother
[47:51] brandham brother brandham was uh was
[47:53] saying here in the lay Odyssey in church
[47:55] age he said said but what has happened
[47:57] to the word he said the word has been
[47:59] put aside so God says I am going against
[48:02] you all I will spew you out of my mouth
[48:05] this is the end for seven out of Seven
[48:08] Ages I have seen nothing but men
[48:10] esteeming their own word above mine so
[48:13] at the end of this age I am spewing you
[48:15] out of my mouth it is all over I am
[48:17] going to speak all right yes I am here
[48:20] in the midst of the church the a man of
[48:22] God faithful and true will reveal
[48:24] himself and it will it will be my my
[48:27] Prophet oh yes that is so Revelations
[48:29] 10:7 that in the days of the voice of
[48:31] the seventh M messenger when he shall
[48:34] begin to sound the mystery of God should
[48:36] be finished as Heath declared to his
[48:39] servants the prophets there it is he is
[48:41] sending a Vindicated prophet he is
[48:44] sending a prophet after almost 2,000
[48:47] years he is sending someone who is so
[48:49] far from organization education and the
[48:52] world of religion that is John the
[48:54] Baptist and Elijah of old he will hear
[48:57] only from God and he will have thus
[48:59] sayith the Lord and speak for God he
[49:02] will be God's mouthpiece as he is as it
[49:05] is declared in Malachi 4:6 will turn the
[49:08] hearts of the children back to the
[49:11] fathers he will bring back the elect of
[49:14] the last day and they will hear a
[49:16] Vindicated Prophet give the exact truth
[49:19] as it was with Paul notice William
[49:21] brandham or the messenger of Malachi 4
[49:24] is not bringing something new he is
[49:26] bringing the exact truth as it was with
[49:29] Paul he will restore the truth as they
[49:33] had it and those elect in those elect
[49:36] with him in the last day in that day
[49:39] will be the ones who truly manifest the
[49:42] Lord notice he will restore the truth as
[49:45] they had it and those elect with him in
[49:47] that day will be the ones who truly
[49:50] manifest the Lord and be his body and be
[49:53] his voice and perform his works hallah
[49:57] do you see it and I believe that we
[49:59] recognize that we we are living in a
[50:01] very special hour by by studying out the
[50:04] scriptures we realize that we are living
[50:07] in the hour where we are seeing the very
[50:09] interpretation of the word of God being
[50:12] made manifest as we we are very familiar
[50:14] with Malachi 4 and it's a very prevalent
[50:17] scripture to us as message Believers but
[50:20] we we realized that over 2400 years that
[50:23] that scripture was laying dormant and it
[50:26] was waiting for the manifesting Time of
[50:28] the Season that it was going to be made
[50:30] manifest and that there would come a
[50:33] time after 2400 years that there would
[50:35] come a time where the ministry of Elijah
[50:38] that was going to come and it was going
[50:40] to forerun the very coming of Christ and
[50:43] I would be able to say it along with you
[50:46] that we can now say that that scripture
[50:48] is history now because Elijah has came
[50:51] and forun the first coming of Christ and
[50:54] the second coming of Christ and we
[50:56] realize that the elect of God have
[50:59] caught exactly that this ministry is
[51:02] going to be a Ministry that will
[51:03] literally cause the very second coming
[51:06] of Christ and when you begin to study
[51:08] out the the the work of Elijah and you
[51:10] begin to study out the ministry of
[51:12] Elijah that this this work of Elijah and
[51:15] the Very trademark of his ministry was
[51:18] to restore the worship back to whom real
[51:21] worship and true worship belongs to and
[51:24] notice whenever Elijah comes on the
[51:26] scene he restores worship notice in the
[51:29] first Elijah he repairs and he restores
[51:32] The Altar and he turns the hearts back
[51:34] to the original and true faith in every
[51:37] single time in the five comings of
[51:39] Elijah you'll notice that the ministry
[51:41] of Elijah does the same exact thing at
[51:44] The Showdown on Mount Carmel Elijah did
[51:47] not build a new altar or build a new
[51:49] religion or did not make up something
[51:51] new but rather he took what had been
[51:54] left aside and what had been broken down
[51:56] and what had been neglected Elijah
[51:58] simply by his ministry placed true
[52:01] worship back in its rightful order and
[52:04] every single time that God ever used the
[52:06] spirit of Elijah he does the same thing
[52:09] in every one of his ministries in every
[52:12] one of Elijah's Ministry he puts he
[52:14] builds upon the same thing that he re it
[52:17] is a message or a Ministry of
[52:19] restoration and notice when you look at
[52:22] the Spirit of Elijah that would come
[52:24] upon the man he would come upon Elijah
[52:26] it would come upon elishah it would come
[52:28] upon John the Baptist then it would come
[52:30] on Malachi 4 and notice there is yet a a
[52:33] future Elijah that is to go unto the
[52:35] Jews of Revelation chapter 11 but notice
[52:40] that that the spirit of Elijah would
[52:41] come and it would it would H it would be
[52:44] against idolatry it would be against
[52:46] false forms of religion including the
[52:49] false or vain worship of the true God
[52:52] notice the ministry of Elijah that it
[52:54] would bring about a much need
[52:56] restoration to the truth of the
[52:59] hour and it would also turn the heart of
[53:02] God's elect back to the true faith and
[53:04] know that we know this by studying out
[53:07] the message of the hour that we've
[53:09] studied it for over 30 to 40 years now
[53:12] we've been real careful students but we
[53:14] realize that the Elijah Ministry was a
[53:17] Supernatural Ministry it was Christ in
[53:20] the spirit of Elijah every single time
[53:23] and Elijah's Ministry was used to to
[53:27] produce and profound to bring forth
[53:29] profound Miracles that were that were
[53:31] laying there in the life of Elijah you
[53:33] can look and you could see in Elijah's
[53:36] Ministry that he shut up the heavens and
[53:38] he caused a drought in First Kings 17
[53:41] notice he he multiplied flour and oil
[53:43] for a widow he raised the Widow Sons The
[53:47] Widow's son from the dead he defeated
[53:49] the prophets of baale with fire from
[53:52] heaven he brought rain to its end and he
[53:55] ended the drought he destroyed 51
[53:58] Soldiers with fire and lightning again
[54:00] he destroyed another 51 Soldiers with
[54:03] fire and lightning and notice his last
[54:06] miracle he parted the Waters of the
[54:09] Jordan River but I think it's a very
[54:11] astounding thing that the same miracle
[54:14] that Elijah ends his ministry with is
[54:16] the same miracle that Elisha starts his
[54:19] ministry with it was a signal that it
[54:21] was the same spirit that was upon Elijah
[54:25] it's now back upon Elisha and I think
[54:27] that it's a very uh compound meaning
[54:30] when you can look at the life of Jesus
[54:32] Christ and you can see the Miracles that
[54:34] were happening in Jesus life you can
[54:37] identify that the same spirit that was
[54:39] Upon Jesus is now upon a body of
[54:44] Believers it is a signal under the
[54:46] Church of the Living God that the same
[54:49] power that was in Elijah was in Elisha
[54:53] it is a signal that the same power that
[54:55] was with that was in the bridegroom is
[54:58] now in the Earthly
[55:00] bride now notice in the first two
[55:02] comings of Elijah you begin to see
[55:05] Miracles there's eight Miracles that are
[55:07] recorded in Elijah's Ministry and
[55:09] there's 16 there is a double portion
[55:12] that is upon Elisha's Ministry he has a
[55:15] double portion of the spirit of Elijah
[55:18] that is upon him but when you study out
[55:21] the third coming of Elijah notice the
[55:24] third coming of Elijah was in John the
[55:26] Baptist but he didn't do no Miracles he
[55:29] was simply preaching the word of God and
[55:31] brother Brenham would identify John the
[55:33] Baptist as a powerful preacher that he
[55:36] even Drew bigger crowds than Jesus ever
[55:40] did you see what he was doing he was
[55:43] making a foundation for the Messiah to
[55:45] come he drew bigger crowds but he was
[55:48] setting a foundation for after the third
[55:51] coming of John after the third coming of
[55:53] Elijah came Jesus notice didn't preach
[55:56] too much he was not much of a Preacher
[55:59] but he was performing signs and wonders
[56:01] as of indication that John's Ministry
[56:04] was in its season and it was thoroughly
[56:07] Vindicated but when it come to the
[56:09] fourth coming of Elijah it came in both
[56:12] preaching and in signs and in
[56:15] Miracles Hallelujah and William brandham
[56:17] said and Look Away to Jesus he said I
[56:19] may not do it he said but this message
[56:22] will introduce Jesus Christ to the world
[56:25] for as John the Baptist was sent to
[56:26] forun the first coming of Christ so is
[56:29] the message to forun the second coming
[56:31] of Christ and John said Behold the Lamb
[56:33] of God that takes away the sin of the
[56:35] world so it is paralleled in every way
[56:39] and I know it will the message will go
[56:42] on so it literally is a signal unto us
[56:45] whether William Brandon was here on
[56:47] Earth or not but the message would
[56:50] introduce Christ to this
[56:53] world again and there is a man that can
[56:55] turn on the lot he said yesterday's
[56:57] Luther's Mana would not work for
[57:00] Methodist he said Methodist Mana would
[57:02] not work for Pentecost he said
[57:04] Pentecostal Mana will not work for us
[57:06] today see it has it see see what I mean
[57:10] every day it come day by day fresh and
[57:13] so it has through the church ages he
[57:16] said Luther's Mana was the message of
[57:18] justification Wesley's message was the
[57:21] man manifestation of sanctification he
[57:24] said and Pentecostal was the restoration
[57:27] of the gifts but this is the introducing
[57:30] The Headstone the last day the bride
[57:32] tree which is contrary to all of it yet
[57:36] it's the same light it was the same
[57:38] light in Luther's day it was the same
[57:40] light in Wesley's day it was the same
[57:43] light in the restoration of gifts but
[57:46] this light is a mature light and is
[57:49] introducing The Headstone of crying
[57:52] Grace
[57:54] Grace notice in this hour you have
[57:57] watched the ministry of Elijah you have
[57:59] been a witness of it you've listened to
[58:01] over 1200 some sermons that God has
[58:04] given to this generation where the
[58:06] ministry of Elijah would stand there
[58:08] night after night and God would
[58:10] thoroughly vindicate himself through his
[58:13] prophet's Ministry sure there was other
[58:15] great men on the scene sure there was
[58:17] Great Mighty Mighty Heroes of Faith or
[58:20] men of faith and Men of renown that was
[58:22] standing there but there was only one
[58:24] Ministry that was standing standing in
[58:26] this generation that could identify that
[58:29] there was an angel that came and
[58:31] commissioned him to preach and to teach
[58:34] what the angel has said and you notice
[58:37] when that Ministry would come into full
[58:39] effect he would stand there say I now
[58:41] take every Spirit under my control for
[58:45] Jesus Christ men tried to understand God
[58:48] they probed into the intellect of God
[58:51] but this Elijah
[58:53] Ministry did not presume did not probe
[58:57] but it was direct it was accurate it was
[59:00] Vindicated it never missed it was proven
[59:04] and this Elijah
[59:06] Ministry proclaimed that The Headstone
[59:09] was
[59:11] here hallelujah David said in Psalms
[59:15] 81822 that the stone which the builders
[59:18] refused is become The Headstone of the
[59:21] corner this is the Lord's doing and it
[59:24] is marvelous in our eyes
[59:26] when you begin to study it out in the
[59:28] margin of the Hebrew that this is the
[59:31] Lord's doing in Hebrew that means this
[59:35] is from the Lord that it it is to be
[59:38] traced alone to the Lord God
[59:41] Almighty notice what you are seeing is
[59:44] traced back to The Headstone what you
[59:46] are witnessing is not traced back to a
[59:49] man what you have been a part of is not
[59:52] traced back to a man of 16 elements but
[59:55] it is traced back to the god that
[59:58] created the Moons and stars the elements
[1:00:00] the atoms it is The Headstone that has
[1:00:04] come this is not the result of wisdom of
[1:00:07] of man or or Man's power but the
[1:00:10] deliverance from danger it is the rising
[1:00:14] up from the low condition that only God
[1:00:16] can do no man can take you from one
[1:00:19] estate and put you in another but it is
[1:00:22] God
[1:00:23] Almighty that removes Kings and sets up
[1:00:27] Kings notice the change by which he who
[1:00:30] has re was rejected was restored to its
[1:00:34] rightful place Hallelujah you were cast
[1:00:38] down you were trotten but he even though
[1:00:41] you look rejected He restored you right
[1:00:44] back to your rightful
[1:00:46] place and any of you that study out the
[1:00:49] message you know that the Bible said in
[1:00:51] Romans 9 and33 that if you study out
[1:00:54] that message if you St out that one
[1:00:56] scripture you can find the entire
[1:00:59] message laying in this one scripture
[1:01:02] behold I lay in Zion a stumbling Stone a
[1:01:05] revelation of offense that whosoever
[1:01:08] believeth on him shall not be ashamed so
[1:01:12] Paul is saying unto us that no one no
[1:01:16] man no Scientology no intellect can
[1:01:19] hinder almighty God from carrying out
[1:01:22] his purpose that this is the the Lord's
[1:01:26] doing that this is because of the
[1:01:31] Lord hallelujah the very fact that God
[1:01:35] is tangible the very fact that he wants
[1:01:38] to be felt the very fact that the god of
[1:01:41] Elijah wants to live and wants to reign
[1:01:44] in
[1:01:45] you it literally makes me live in awe
[1:01:48] and wonder of his grander that the god
[1:01:51] that lived in Moses wants to live in you
[1:01:55] that the god that lived in Elijah wants
[1:01:57] to live in you that the God that was in
[1:02:00] David wants to live in you the God that
[1:02:03] was in Daniel wants to live in you it's
[1:02:06] very powerful when you begin to think
[1:02:08] about the goodness of
[1:02:12] God that it wasn't just for the
[1:02:14] forefathers it wasn't just for Paul it
[1:02:17] wasn't just for William branam but that
[1:02:20] God the god of Elijah the god of the
[1:02:24] Moon the god of the
[1:02:27] Stars want to so inhabit your soul that
[1:02:31] demons won't know where to run for
[1:02:33] cover that God wants to so live in you
[1:02:37] that it can breathe praise out of your
[1:02:39] lips and it Ador
[1:02:44] Adonai
[1:02:46] Hallelujah now the prophets declared
[1:02:49] that Jehovah wasn't just some mere God
[1:02:51] like the gods of the
[1:02:54] Nations but that that had to be packed
[1:02:56] around like some
[1:02:58] Idol when the prophets would stand there
[1:03:00] they would stand there and Proclaim him
[1:03:03] as Elohim the self-existing one he rules
[1:03:06] and he reigns he's not a God that you
[1:03:08] have to carry but he's a god that'll
[1:03:10] carry you he's God on the mountain and
[1:03:13] he's God in the valley he's God in the
[1:03:17] battle and he's God in Victory he's God
[1:03:20] in storm and he's God in peace and the
[1:03:23] Bible said in Psalms 93 the the Lord
[1:03:26] reth he is clothed with Majesty the Lord
[1:03:29] is clothed with strength wherewith he ha
[1:03:31] guarded himself the world also is
[1:03:34] established that it cannot be moved thy
[1:03:37] Throne is established of old thou art
[1:03:40] from Everlasting the floods have lifted
[1:03:42] up oh Lord the floods have lifted up
[1:03:44] their voice the floods have lifted up
[1:03:46] their ways but the Lord is on high
[1:03:49] mightier than the noise of many Waters
[1:03:53] yay than the mighty waves of the sea my
[1:03:56] testimonies are very sure
[1:03:59] Holiness becometh thine house oh Lord
[1:04:02] forever so what is David saying unto us
[1:04:05] that the troubles that surround you that
[1:04:08] the Lord on high is mightier is mightier
[1:04:12] than the waves it's mightier than the
[1:04:14] voices let me put it to you like this
[1:04:17] torment destruction
[1:04:20] sickness Our God that rains on high is
[1:04:24] mightier than the voices of all of hell
[1:04:28] he shuts the mouth of lions he stops the
[1:04:30] winds and waves he slays armies he kills
[1:04:34] Giants he crushes Nations he heals the
[1:04:37] weak he casts out Devils he raises the
[1:04:41] dead He blesses the curse he conquers
[1:04:44] all things and his name ain't weak his
[1:04:47] name ain't lost his name ain't confused
[1:04:50] but his name is Jesus
[1:04:56] if he can deliver from a giant he can
[1:04:59] deliver from cancer if he can deliver
[1:05:01] from cancer he can deliver from
[1:05:03] depression if he can deliver from
[1:05:05] depression he can deliver from
[1:05:08] suicide I'll say there's no God like my
[1:05:14] God somebody bless the Lord God
[1:05:21] Almighty
[1:05:23] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:05:25] [Applause]
[1:05:28] Hallelujah ain't no God like my
[1:05:32] God and job come to the conclusion in
[1:05:35] his life that this God was a God that
[1:05:37] wanted to be
[1:05:39] known job would have never had the idea
[1:05:43] that God could be known unless God would
[1:05:44] have implanted the thought on the inside
[1:05:46] of job and job come out with a
[1:05:50] resolution that he said I know that my
[1:05:52] redeemer lives and job 42 and2 he says I
[1:05:56] know that thou car that thou can't do
[1:06:00] everything that no thought can be
[1:06:02] withholden from thee so job recognized
[1:06:05] him as the god that sees all things that
[1:06:09] understands all things and nothing can
[1:06:11] be hidden from
[1:06:13] him and when Jesus was talking about
[1:06:17] about the Gospel of Jesus Christ how
[1:06:19] that how that men would receive it and
[1:06:21] how men would turn it down in Matthew 9
[1:06:24] and 26 but Jesus beheld them and said
[1:06:27] unto him with men this is impossible but
[1:06:31] With God all things are possible
[1:06:34] Hallelujah in Jeremiah 20 And1 The Bible
[1:06:38] said but the Lord is with me as a mighty
[1:06:41] terrible one when you study that out in
[1:06:44] the Hebrew he means he is El gior that
[1:06:48] he is God the
[1:06:51] hero he the Lord is with me as the god
[1:06:57] hero there for my persecutors shall
[1:07:00] stumble they shall not Prevail they
[1:07:03] shall be greatly ashamed for they shall
[1:07:06] not Prosper their Everlasting confusion
[1:07:09] shall never be
[1:07:11] forgotten Hannah spoke these words in
[1:07:14] Isaiah or 1 Samuel 2 And1 and Hannah
[1:07:17] prayed and said my heart rejoiceth in

[1:10:29] when brother random comes and he
[1:10:30] preaches redemption in the completeness
[1:10:31] of
[1:10:32] Joy he starts taking us about how the
[1:10:36] Mana how that they come out of Egypt and
[1:10:39] they begin to murmur and complain that
[1:10:41] they that they that they had didn't have
[1:10:43] nothing to eat and God be to rain down
[1:10:46] angel food to them that notice that that
[1:10:50] Mana it never did cease on their entire
[1:10:53] Journey it kept them through that an
[1:10:55] entire Journey brother B said I can see
[1:10:58] those Israelites that had just passed
[1:11:00] through the Red Sea had just been
[1:11:02] redeemed by the blood seen the healing
[1:11:04] power of God or the miraculous power
[1:11:06] standing between God and between Israel
[1:11:08] and Egypt and had drowned their enemies
[1:11:11] behind that he said like that old cancer
[1:11:14] it's gone forever the blindness was gone
[1:11:17] the deafness was gone the diabetus was
[1:11:19] gone everything's done drowned back
[1:11:22] Yonder in the blood of Jesus how do you
[1:11:24] feel
[1:11:28] how do you feel my walk down the street
[1:11:31] and some old critic say now wait a
[1:11:33] minute are you sure of that don't you
[1:11:35] talk to me amen he said I can see them
[1:11:38] out there talking about Gathering it up
[1:11:40] he said he said I can see him out there
[1:11:43] just to Gathering up Gathering up eating
[1:11:46] having a glorious time he said just like
[1:11:48] an oldfashioned Holy Ghost meeting he
[1:11:51] said here will come the spirit of God
[1:11:52] moving over some little saint will reach
[1:11:54] up and give get it in their heart like
[1:11:56] that holler praise the Lord just an
[1:11:58] oldfashioned meeting like that yes sir
[1:12:01] they were just catching it from one side
[1:12:03] to the other having a good
[1:12:05] time well let's put it like this sister
[1:12:08] India started Gathering down here and
[1:12:11] brother Denny started Gathering back
[1:12:13] here and she started saying praise the
[1:12:17] Lord help me out just a minute praise
[1:12:20] the Lord how about it sister Katie she
[1:12:23] started saying
[1:12:25] and then all of a sudden all the way
[1:12:27] back there in the back brother alen got
[1:12:29] grabbed a hold of it what was it they
[1:12:32] were grabbing a hold of the same Mana
[1:12:35] they could have been on the other side
[1:12:37] of the field they could have been in
[1:12:39] doubt they could have been in fear but
[1:12:41] there was a old Holy Ghost
[1:12:44] Revival it was an old Holy Ghost Revival
[1:12:47] that was breaking out because the Mana
[1:12:51] never did
[1:12:53] cease and I'll say this if you can have
[1:12:56] enough Faith to grab a hold of it right
[1:13:01] here let's have our and oh holy ghost
[1:13:04] meeting one more time praise the Lord
[1:13:08] he's still the same yesterday today and
[1:13:13] forever well I don't see what they're
[1:13:15] shouting about they just grabbed a hold
[1:13:18] of the same manner that was in the upper
[1:13:22] room blessed be the name of the
[1:13:27] Lord it never did
[1:13:30] cease he said it was a perfect type of
[1:13:35] Pentecost it was a perfect type of
[1:13:37] Pentecost that that Mana never did
[1:13:40] cease it never did cease let me say this
[1:13:43] to you like William brandham said the
[1:13:45] apostolic day and age will not cease
[1:13:49] until we go into a
[1:13:53] Rapture I am claiming unto you that the
[1:13:56] god that Mary met the god that Peter met
[1:14:00] the god that Paul met is a God in this
[1:14:04] room and if you got enough Faith to
[1:14:06] believe it God will set your heart to
[1:14:08] believe it that all things are
[1:14:12] [Applause]
[1:14:23] possible I don't I don't it's not that I
[1:14:25] don't have V volume Brothers is that
[1:14:28] there's no there's nothing to back
[1:14:31] up there's nothing to back up what's
[1:14:33] coming what I'm putting out so if you
[1:14:36] can kind of manipulate it a little bit
[1:14:39] you see it's preaching and working with
[1:14:41] a sound system sometimes is like
[1:14:43] preaching to a real audience you see
[1:14:45] it's got to match what I'm putting
[1:14:49] out because the more that I put out the
[1:14:52] more it can has the capacity to handle
[1:14:54] the the Lord you say well I don't know
[1:14:57] exactly what you're talking about I'll
[1:14:58] tell you it's kind of like the god of
[1:14:59] Elijah that when when she started when
[1:15:02] he when he went down there in his Elijah
[1:15:04] Ministry that there was a woman Brothers
[1:15:07] y'all y'all doing one thing but God's
[1:15:09] doing another thing up here so y'all
[1:15:10] just keep doing what you're doing but
[1:15:12] literally that the god of Elijah he went
[1:15:15] down there and he' promised this little
[1:15:16] shunamite woman that had done showed him
[1:15:18] favor and built him a house sister
[1:15:20] Gabriel and had put him into a place and
[1:15:23] they they love the message that Elijah
[1:15:24] was ministering and so they built a
[1:15:26] place to keep him there they built a
[1:15:29] place to keep him there and that this
[1:15:31] son died had a heat stroke and and and
[1:15:33] she went up there where Elijah was up
[1:15:35] there worshiping and gesus saw her said
[1:15:38] there' be that shunamite woman that has
[1:15:40] that boy and he and he began to speak to
[1:15:42] her said is all well and her testimony
[1:15:45] was the same as Elijah's
[1:15:48] testimony her faith matched Elijah's
[1:15:51] Ministry you see she was putting out
[1:15:54] what Elijah was putting out her faith
[1:15:57] was not in his Rod that gazel was told
[1:16:00] to go out there and to lay it on her
[1:16:03] faith was in Elijah's Ministry it's like
[1:16:07] Hallelujah William brandham said it like
[1:16:09] this he said he said if you come with
[1:16:11] the same faith that your pastor's got he
[1:16:14] said you'll match what is being put out
[1:16:17] and
[1:16:19] hallelujah it's got to be something take
[1:16:21] place that little woman went there with
[1:16:24] the faith of aij and Elijah was that
[1:16:28] Faith what happened a miracle took place
[1:16:33] he laid his hand on his hand he laid his
[1:16:35] head on his head he laid his feet on his
[1:16:37] feet and before long when the Elijah
[1:16:40] Ministry was laid over a bride it
[1:16:43] started sneezing seven
[1:16:47] times what was it that boy was matching
[1:16:52] what Elijah was
[1:16:58] hallelujah what was it God was taking
[1:17:05] over Hallelujah when it come to first
[1:17:08] king
[1:17:09] 18 when it come to mount
[1:17:13] carel when to come to a
[1:17:17] showdown whether you're going to serve
[1:17:20] God either the god of Elijah or the god
[1:17:23] of Baal it was is coming to a
[1:17:25] declaration who you going to
[1:17:28] serve First Kings
[1:17:32] 18:36 and it came to pass that at the
[1:17:36] time of the offering of the evening Ser
[1:17:39] sacrifice that Elijah the prophet came
[1:17:41] near and said Lord God of
[1:17:43] Abraham Isaac and of
[1:17:45] Israel let it be known this day that
[1:17:49] thou are God in Israel and that I am thy
[1:17:53] servant and that I have done all these
[1:17:55] things at Thy
[1:17:58] word hear
[1:18:00] me hear
[1:18:02] me hear me hear me you worshippers of
[1:18:06] baale hear me you worshippers of the
[1:18:09] true God hear me oh Lord hear me that
[1:18:12] this people may know that thou art the
[1:18:15] Lord God and that thou H has turn their
[1:18:19] heart back
[1:18:22] again hear me God
[1:18:25] hear my Ministry hear my faith that they
[1:18:28] may know that their hearts have been
[1:18:30] turned back
[1:18:32] again then the fire of the Lord fell and
[1:18:36] consumed the burnt sacrifice and the
[1:18:38] wood and the stones and the dust and
[1:18:40] licked up the water that was in the
[1:18:42] trench and when all the people saw it
[1:18:46] they fell on their faces and they said
[1:18:50] the
[1:18:51] Lord he is the god
[1:18:56] he's not a God he is the god the Lord he
[1:19:02] is the
[1:19:05] god what was it it was a
[1:19:08] showdown it was a showdown and God
[1:19:11] showed
[1:19:12] up Hallelujah you can put this message
[1:19:15] in a corner and God will show up you can
[1:19:18] put people against this message and
[1:19:21] websites against this message and blogs
[1:19:24] against this message message but my God
[1:19:27] in the middle of a showdown will show
[1:19:31] up in the middle of your crisis he'll
[1:19:34] show up in the middle of your dilemma
[1:19:36] he'll show up in the middle of your
[1:19:38] storm he'll show up in the middle of it
[1:19:42] in the middle of it in the middle of it
[1:19:45] I'm going to say this to you loud and
[1:19:47] clear the Lord he is the god
[1:19:52] [Applause]
[1:20:00] what good does it do to preach a god of
[1:20:02] History if he isn't the same today and
[1:20:04] brother and sister I say this I read of
[1:20:06] a god of a history one time I read of
[1:20:08] him in books I read of him in the Bible
[1:20:10] but one day I met him I met him he come
[1:20:13] to me he told me not to drink nor to
[1:20:15] smoke and defile myself and he had
[1:20:18] something for me to do when I got older
[1:20:20] I was just a little bitty boy but he
[1:20:22] proved that he did it and here's the
[1:20:24] picture hanging right here where science
[1:20:26] has took it he's not a god of
[1:20:29] yesterday he's a god of
[1:20:33] today and when you have a need your need
[1:20:36] brings Jesus on the scene you know when
[1:20:39] when William random is standing there in
[1:20:41] the marriage and divorce series he's
[1:20:43] standing there and at the very beginning
[1:20:45] of that message and the me that that
[1:20:48] series of services William brandham
[1:20:50] starts talking about how that this
[1:20:51] special this spot was real special to
[1:20:53] him he said because some 40 some years
[1:20:56] ago or 30 some years ago he said I was
[1:20:58] in this same spot when I saw my Lord
[1:21:01] Jesus how did he had his daddy's need
[1:21:03] you remember he was praying for his
[1:21:05] daddy and the Lord called him out there
[1:21:07] in that broom Sage field and he saw
[1:21:09] Jesus out there it's a
[1:21:13] sign that your need brings
[1:21:17] Jesus let me tell you something if you
[1:21:20] can catch what I just give you it's
[1:21:23] powerful his C by his need brought
[1:21:26] Christ by his way it's a sign that
[1:21:28] Christ does not diminish his attributes
[1:21:31] are available to
[1:21:35] you don't you let nobody tell you that
[1:21:38] the days of Miracles is passed don't
[1:21:40] know let nobody tell you that the Holy
[1:21:42] Ghost ain't just the same as it ever was
[1:21:45] don't you let nobody ever tell you that
[1:21:47] Jesus is not alive and right here in
[1:21:49] this church and not doing the same
[1:21:51] things that he did don't you let nobody
[1:21:54] you hear me young people don't you let
[1:21:56] nobody ever try to tell you that God
[1:21:59] don't give the Holy Ghost don't you let
[1:22:01] anybody ever try to talk you out of your
[1:22:03] Pentecostal experience don't ever let
[1:22:05] anybody try to talk you out of your
[1:22:08] emotions of preaching and speaking and
[1:22:11] and living out the word don't you let
[1:22:15] nobody don't let nobody talk you out of
[1:22:21] this you got a choice to make you you
[1:22:24] got a choice to make whether you going
[1:22:25] to serve God or whether you're going to
[1:22:27] serve the god of
[1:22:29] Baal I tell you your cost of indecision
[1:22:32] will cost you one of these days when
[1:22:34] you're
[1:22:36] burning but because of your decision as
[1:22:39] the Bride of Jesus Christ to stand out
[1:22:41] for the true and living
[1:22:44] [Applause]

[1:24:57] who came back with a double portion
[1:24:59] folded up that manle and said where is
[1:25:02] the god of Elijah let the god that wrote

[1:25:37] needs my faith and William brandom said
[1:25:39] in perfect Faith he said when there is a
[1:25:41] faith that is isolated through the world
[1:25:43] in a newness of Christ he said you're
[1:25:45] bringing forth bright material then and
[1:25:48] you're getting into rapturing condition
[1:25:50] when your faith is isolated away from
[1:25:53] the thoughts what men have said that God
[1:25:55] is this and God is
[1:25:58] that I say where be the god of
[1:26:02] Elijah let cancer stand
[1:26:05] up Smite the
[1:26:07] waters come on somebody let depression

[1:26:22] Lord God that brings prod goes back home
[1:26:25] where is the Lord God that Health where
[1:26:28] is the Lord God that
[1:26:31] [Applause]
[1:26:38] [Applause]
[1:26:48] deliverthat some
[1:26:51] excerpts on what God is Not
[1:26:56] that God is not some object way off or
[1:26:58] some historical something he's
[1:27:01] living his present tense and his word is
[1:27:05] made manifest God is not in material
[1:27:08] things God is in men the Holy Ghost
[1:27:11] never fell on organizations it fell on
[1:27:13] men God is not an idol God is a spirit
[1:27:17] God is not understood by knowledge God
[1:27:20] is understood by faith God is not dead
[1:27:23] God is not known no other way but by
[1:27:25] faith God is not the author of sickness
[1:27:28] God is not three God is one God is Not
[1:27:32] divided God is not bound up to any
[1:27:34] denomination or any barriers he's only
[1:27:37] duty bound to his
[1:27:40] word y'all like that all right God is
[1:27:44] not a myth God is a being God Jesus he
[1:27:47] God he is a being therefore he is
[1:27:51] omniscient Omni pressent omnipotent and
[1:27:54] infinite I'm sorry I'm sliding in a few
[1:27:56] things on what God is too God is Not un
[1:28:00] unjust God is not responsible if you die
[1:28:03] in your sin of unbelief God is not
[1:28:10] complicated God is not
[1:28:14] complicated well high five yourself you
[1:28:16] just got yourself out of the
[1:28:18] complication if you got God on your side
[1:28:29] God is Not foolish he's the source of
[1:28:31] all wisdom God is not a man that he
[1:28:34] should lie God is not the god of the
[1:28:36] dead but of the Living God is Not
[1:28:41] unrighteous and God is not
[1:28:44] wearied because the Bible said in Isaiah
[1:28:47] 40 and 28 hast thou not known hast thou
[1:28:50] not KN hast thou not heard that the
[1:28:53] Everlasting God the Lord the creator of
[1:28:55] the ends of the Earth fth not neither is
[1:28:58] weary there is no searching of his
[1:29:02] understanding let me let me just draw
[1:29:05] back right here for a minute God is
[1:29:07] accepting the challenge of your
[1:29:12] life God is not worried God is Not
[1:29:15] unrighteous God is not complicated but
[1:29:18] God is accepting the challenge of your
[1:29:21] life if he accepted and Portland Oregon
[1:29:25] the challenge that came up against him
[1:29:27] when that chief of tribe of demons tried
[1:29:29] to destroy him and his ministry God
[1:29:33] accepted the challenge I say this to you
[1:29:35] that God is accepting the challenge in
[1:29:37] your life to prove that he greater than
[1:29:40] Le osia that is greater than
[1:29:42] lukewarmness that is greater than
[1:29:44] blindness that is greater than diseases
[1:29:47] that is greater than your
[1:29:50] troubles the ability of God is greater
[1:29:53] than than
[1:29:58] man the ability of God is greater than
[1:30:01] Satan because the Bible said in Daniel
[1:30:04] 3:17 that he's able to deliver Jesus
[1:30:07] said that he's able to raise up children
[1:30:09] from Stones Paul said in Romans 4:21
[1:30:13] that he's able to fulfill promises Paul
[1:30:15] again said that he's able to make grace
[1:30:17] abound he's able to do exceedingly
[1:30:20] abundantly above all that we could ever
[1:30:22] ask or think according to the power that
[1:30:24] worketh in Us in Philippians 3:21 he's
[1:30:27] able to subdue all things in 2 Timothy
[1:30:31] 1:12 that he's able to guard the Soul's
[1:30:33] Treasures Hebrews 7 and 25 that he's
[1:30:36] able to save to the uttermost and Jude 1
[1:30:39] and2 24 says that he's able to keep you
[1:30:42] from
[1:30:43] falling I don't know whether you
[1:30:45] recognize this or not God hallelujah is
[1:30:49] not counting on your ability he is
[1:30:52] counting on his ability and when you
[1:30:54] take God at his word and when you
[1:30:57] realize that God is more than able the
[1:31:00] miracle will take place on the word of
[1:31:02] God just like it did in Elijah's
[1:31:04] Ministry when the woman only had but a
[1:31:07] handful of
[1:31:08] meal she simply took God at his word and
[1:31:11] the Miracle took place after God was
[1:31:15] stck at his word so the miracle will
[1:31:19] take place on the word of
[1:31:22] God Son Psalms 33 and8 said let all the
[1:31:25] Earth fear the lord let all the
[1:31:28] inhabitants of the world stand in all of
[1:31:31] him for he spake and it was done he
[1:31:36] commanded and it stood
[1:31:40] fast it is his
[1:31:42] will to
[1:31:45] heal it is his will to
[1:31:47] save it is his will to
[1:31:50] deliver it is his will to set free
[1:31:54] it is his will to change it is his will
[1:31:57] to glorify
[1:31:59] himself because he has committed to his
[1:32:04] word I know that I know that you may
[1:32:07] have shocked the devil just a minute ago
[1:32:09] when you believed that a miracle would
[1:32:11] take place in
[1:32:13] here I like shocking the
[1:32:17] devil but let me let me let me just lay
[1:32:19] some Bible Doctrine in here that The
[1:32:22] Healing Ministry
[1:32:24] is the Bible
[1:32:27] way that we realize that by the word of
[1:32:31] the hour that God is no longer a vague
[1:32:34] and distant God but he's one that is
[1:32:37] ready to reveal himself to the sons of
[1:32:42] men let me say this to you he's still
[1:32:44] Isaiah
[1:32:46] 53 I I'll say this he's the god of that
[1:32:49] scripture he's the god that Health our
[1:32:52] diseases he's a God that calms the
[1:32:54] storms he's a God hallelujah he's a God
[1:32:58] that comes out upon your Troubled Waters
[1:33:00] he's a God that knows the way in and he
[1:33:03] knows the way out he knows how to get
[1:33:06] you out of depression and he knows you
[1:33:08] how to he knows how to get you into his
[1:33:10] promise there is no one that can fool a
[1:33:13] man who has seen God at work before his
[1:33:17] own eyes how can you sit there and try
[1:33:19] to tell Lazarus that he was still dead
[1:33:22] when he was alive
[1:33:24] try telling the blind man that he still
[1:33:27] couldn't see when his eyes was open try
[1:33:30] telling the Bride of Jesus Christ that
[1:33:32] what she has is false she's got an
[1:33:36] isolated
[1:33:37] Faith she don't care what you think she
[1:33:40] don't care what men say she don't care
[1:33:42] what critics say she don't care what
[1:33:44] scoffers
[1:33:48] say I know that the god of Elijah is the
[1:33:52] God of this body Bible his power is real
[1:33:56] his Supernatural elements are in this
[1:34:00] room heaven is real and Isaiah said that
[1:34:04] heaven is my throne and the Earth is my
[1:34:06] foot stol but where is my house that
[1:34:10] you'll build unto me I want to say this
[1:34:12] loud and clear shout it over the
[1:34:15] Internet that God has a house in this
[1:34:19] bride body that he can work in that he
[1:34:22] can manifest himself in and we are not
[1:34:26] ashamed of
[1:34:27] [Applause]
[1:34:31] it the church is no longer the
[1:34:34] mouthpiece of God but he has spewed her
[1:34:37] out in this
[1:34:39] generation but he is confounding her
[1:34:42] through the prophet and the bride they
[1:34:45] are saying the same thing the spirit and
[1:34:48] the bride say
[1:34:51] come he's got a body he's got a house I

[1:34:59] mouthpiece of almighty

[1:44:50] healing Angel so close to me that I
[1:44:52] could just reach out and touch him she
[1:44:54] said but it didn't change anything in my
[1:44:56] symptoms but her faith still

[1:45:02] there was a pastor that started
[1:45:03] preaching about the God that does
[1:45:05] extreme things that he's a God that does
[1:45:07] exploits that he's a God that does
[1:45:10] Miracles hallelujah hallelujah and that

[1:59:10] Miracles can be
[1:59:12] done if they can take aprons off of
[1:59:15] Paul's body and just lay them on the
