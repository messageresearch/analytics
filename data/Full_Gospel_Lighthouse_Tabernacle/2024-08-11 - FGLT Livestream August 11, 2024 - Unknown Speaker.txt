care of those things and so we're down at brother Danny steemans some of those lost their their homes and you'll please pray for them that God would just be with them and uh in a special way and amen one of these days we're going to a place where there's no more storms and amen a it good to us what an awesome sermon last night amen I was there when brother Bisal told us those things and I I'll be

well amen we want to remember Sister Nancy that God would touch her and sister Denise as well also brother Clarence is just just having a really tough time and so he's lost about 50 PBS and so he didn't have 50 lbs to lose and so I think he's coming home today and then he's going to go to UVA for a procedure and then come back to you to RMH for a procedure so may the Lord just be with him and and all of those things and I've got a very busy week I I I've been away for a couple of weeks so my my appointments are stacking up so I've got a very busy week this week with that and so amen if you will turn with me to Luke chapter 10 and verse 17 Luke chapter 10 and verse 17 amen brother Timothy we're praying for all of you I I don't know exactly who all is attached there so brother Timothy Sister Sarah Sister Christina have I got it Faith thank you amen we want to pray for them their their grandmother passed away and I think she was 90 years old and H what a what a good age to live to amen so so amen so God bless you praying for you this week and do you have any idea when all of that's going to happen Okay amen so want to remember that in prayer that God would just be with them and amen Luke chapter 10 and verse 17 and the 70 returned again with Joy saying Lord even the devils are subject unto us through thy name they had had a good oldfashioned charismatic time hadn't they amen and he said unto them I beheld Satan as lightning fall from Heaven it's quite a statement Jesus response behold I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you notwithstanding in this Rejoice not that the the spirits are subject unto you I love this next statement but rather Rejoice because your names are written in heaven Hallelujah and in that hour Jesus rejoiced in the spirit and said I thank thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth that thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent and revealed them unto the babes even so father for so it is seemed good in thy sight all things are delivered to me of my father and no man knoweth that whom the son is but the father and who the father is but the son and he to whom the son will reveal him and he turned him unto the disciples and said privately blessed are the eyes which see the the things that you see and I tell you that many prophets and Kings have desired to see those things which you see and have not seen them and to hear those things which you hear and have not heard them maybe you have a need on your heart you just like to say brother Ron would you remember remember me in prayer amen let's pray Heavenly Father how we love you today and we already feel your presence in the building Lord we just thank you Father for desire to come to the house of the Lord and when you come Lord we're just so thrilled that we can be in your presence now I ask you every hand that has went up I pray that you'd stretch forth your hand of mercy and Grace you're the Healer of all of our sicknesses Lord sister Nancy that's in the hospital sister Denise brother Clarence that's getting out today the many others that we've already called here this evening every need Lord not too big or too small you can take care of every one of us and Lord all of us want more of your spirit living inside of us and Lord we ask you now that you would touch our hearts and touch our lives and minister to us in a special way we pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask you and we all say amen God bless you as you are seated today this week is a very emotional week for me and I begin to think back a few years ago I was at brother Danny steemans um it was the month before it was actually the month of that I would get a cancer diagnosis and we had held the meeting together and it was brother Tim PR brother Timothy PR and brother Jason Jackson and my myself spoke that meeting at brother Danny steemans that year and we had had a wonderful meeting the last service we had finished up and we were to we were to fly out the next morning each of us was flying out in different times and and uh that night I'd went to bed and and I had a vision as I went to bed it was a vision to where that I would see as I would go and begin to walk through a utter chaos I can't describe how dark that place was or how Wicked that it was and I was just walking down through it and and I just I begin to see all of the things that was crashing in and it looked like it looked like uh just a horror of a nightmare when I got to the very bottom of that I would find sister Melissa and and and I would see her there and she was in a very difficult spot at that time and so I would see her there and I would see her and in all of that Darkness I saw a ray of light as it would come down on her and I I just walked up to her and I said are you ready to go home and she took me by the arm and she said I'm ready to go home it took a few years for that to happen but we're going to have a wedding this week brother Tom and sister Melissa and that Vision will will be [Applause] fulfilled I want to give another part of that you cannot imagine in the spring I was going through a very difficult time and I knew this was being planned and there was a brother Doug there was a a guy in my ear Whispering you'll never live to preach that wedding well I want to tell that guy that's been whispering in my ear he didn't have the final say so we thank God for that amen isn't isn't he wonderful isn't he wonderful I want to thank you for all your prayers and everything that you have prayed for us and and just so that guy that's whispering in my ear I'm I'm booking meetings for next year so he might as well just be quiet for a while I think we're in a very crucial hour and I just want to share some things on my heart I think we're in a very crucial hour and we're witnessing what Jesus is talking about Kings and Prophets would like to see the age that you and I are seeing and sometimes we don't understand kind of all the things that are happening if it wasn't for the prophet of the Lord to come in this age we couldn't put nothing together and so he would begin to describe things for you and I'm not going to go too far in that angle but and so we realize that that what we're seeing and what we're witnessing the bride's Revival that is going on um brother brother Gab actually after the prayer line last night in Ohio brother Gabe got in the car somewhere around 10:30 and he drove all the way home so he wins the award for today of driving the most and and so uh so three energy drinks will bring you a long way so but we're witnessing incredible events taking place but we we realize that God will not leave one that's right that's right he'll not leave one here and God has determined that every one of us we're going to make it we're going to make it and and he is he is moving on our protols to come home he is moving on every seed and and we realize that we're living in a very crucial moment the junction of time time is basically intercepted with prophecy and we're watching it be fulfilled in politics in war Israel's fighting for its own existence not only that the bride has awakened in this day and she realizes who who she is and what she stands for and that she is an invincible Army we recognize what Satan has tried to do to destroy the Bride of Jesus Christ Christ and listen let me just say this to you that seat of God that's on the inside of you the scripture says that it would deceive the very elected if it were possible if but brother Brandon would answer that and say because of that predestinated seed it is not possible for you to be deceived so sometimes we come to church we get up on a Sunday morning and we come on a Saturday night and we think well this is just another day I want you to understand in Satan's kingdom he has tried everything abely he's tried everything to stop you he's throw the very best bait he can he's throwed every demon that he can against you and you're still standing amen you're still standing and there's nothing that he's got that can stop you because you came from God and you're going back to God the prophecies that have been prophesied for all of this time it's becoming history almost by the day and we can say these words even now Lord come Jesus Lord Jesus we can tell the devil give way in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we can look as brother brandom would preach in desperation Shake Yourself pinch your conscience he would make the statements over and over again don't miss it now don't miss it now and I think about this tonight as or today as I stand here before you I would hate to get this close before the coming of the Lord and miss it I would really hate to get right up to to the ark door being closed and Noah didn't close the ark God closed the ark and I would hate to get this close before the Rapture the resurrection I just drop this in I would hate to be the ones in the household and individuals in the household go well there there's mom there's Grandma you see her coming up the up the yard you do you see her no I have to be honest with you I I don't see her I'd hate to get this close and Miss what's going on Sir now I want you to just think about this and we just preached this a couple uh couple of weeks ago the serpants of Matthew Mark Luke and John they made sure because they were guarding the book of Acts and they made sure that those that were not seed couldn't see it but he made sure that those that were seed couldn't help but see it that's enough to shout about right there so it blinded the eyes we just made the statement it's laying right here there went the prophet of God in 1946 and he begin to preach the deity of Jesus Christ he would meet the angel then he would begin to go forth with the message of the hour and go all over the world but when it comes towards 5657 brother Brandon would stand there and say America has rejected Ed it she's turned down the message she's turned down her call and then there goes Billy Graham and all Roberts their tents are getting bigger they're being socially accepted but the message has been turned down but the messengers to Sodom they became more popular as they went along let me just say this message will never be socially correct it'll never be accepted by the world but I want you to understand for that predestinated seat for that predestinated seed he knows how to find you well that's enough to shake us right quickly no matter where you're at he knows how to find you brother Ben he knows how to come and get you he knows how he get you Brother David when you wasn't looking for it right now remember this the scripture says Jesus would Jesus would say it no man can come to me except my father draws him and all that the father has given me will come yes sir don't you love it now remember God is his own interpreter it won't be left up to a man a feeble Mind of a man to interpret his word amen Lord and I want you to understand sometimes we think about visions and the reason I dropped that in for you the reason I dropped that in is maybe through the last few years you said brother Ron I didn't see what you saw maybe I didn't see this or maybe I didn't see that but I could hold on to the rest of assurance that God knows how to fulfill his word brother Brandon would talk about the Carib move he would talk about the Silver Tip grizzly bear he would talk about different visions and you know the prophet saw the vision and knowing god wouldn't miss his words even in the prayer lines that night after night after night he would see visions that would take him back 40 years or talking take him back and those Visions would stand there and not only see the the the years ago but see the present and then see the future God not only saw you now but he saw you before the foundation of the world so I want you to understand sometimes the devil will whisper in your ear and here's where we want to get a very good foundation tonight because as we go toward the Rapture he's going to work harder than ever before you will not be able to defeat him on your emotions your feelings but you will take him back to the word of God you'll take him back to the word and say right here is where God thought of me and if he ever thought of me he will never unthink of me hallu now remember it's not a book of man it's the book of God and the man who sees the vision or hears God's voice never un misunderstood it many times thems and in many cases Isaiah would have the vision Behold a virgin shall conceive go to his grave and maybe never understood it but it was God's voice it was God's word yes sir and if God spoke it that's exactly the way it's going to be are you with me now remember God is in his word and God will fulfill his word and Satan is always standing near trying to defeat the plan of God so if you're the final voice brother Doug if you're the final voice you are where God is happening hallelu so Mary when she said be it unto me according to to Thy word she was where God was happening every day she was confessing I'm carrying the Messiah every day she was giving that testimony I met an angel every day she was reminding this is what the angel said to me and I believed him in his word that was where God was happening in at that day but you're in a different day and you are where God is happening at in this day are you with me God's Vision has been for told since the beginning and now you are carrying out walking out talking out thinking of wow you're the very creative word of God being manifested in this day now I want you to just notice I want to go a different way Israel is under intense attacks oh yeah every day from the enemy their very existence they're being threatened to be driven into the ocean just last week they dest destroyed two leaders of Hamas and even even Iran is trying to figure out how did they pull that off being an extremely protected area no doubt the devil goes how did God pull that off I thought I had them I thought I would destroyed them I thought i' throw too much dirt on them and God reaching is in that predestinated seed and he brings it to [Applause] life so s so Israel is carrying out they're carrying out the manifested word for this day remember they going to survive listen don't bet against them they're going to survive and remember there's two prophets that are coming that are going to preach the message of the hour that you have heard are you with me and this message will produce a resurrection this message will produce a Rapture it's not an if this message will change your body it's not an if it's not up for debate it's it's not up for negotiation this message will it will produce an overcomer I'm one of them I'm a testimony that I this message [Music] works are you with me oh how it must baffle Satan he can attack you with such sickness and you still overcome he must he it must baffle him can you imagine how much it baffled him when a woman is sit and listen to a testimony about three squirrels being spoken into existence and she simply responds I thought last night was so perfect she simply resp response that's nothing but the truth brother Brandon that's nothing but the truth you say well brother Ron you bringing up something 50 years ago let me just say this you when you sit in a service when you sit in a service and you respond with your vocal cords amen and you say that's nothing but but the truth you don't realize in another dimension she didn't know that Angels were standing there opening the bank of heaven and saying get what you want you don't realize when the word is going forth and the word begins to and you begin to respond from that predestinated seat that's nothing but the truth I believe that with all my heart listen the of Heaven comes open to you glory glory in the same median P people can be critical and I I take it back brother Rand was preaching various sermons there was people got so upset they lit up cigarettes they were so disrespectful but at the same time God was bringing a bride are you with me brother bisco said when he recognized brother brandham said his best friend didn't recognize it at all and he was gone in 6 months dead but we've watched decades es of brother Boll preaching decades being faithful to the cause being energized by the message of the hour I wonder what will be said in our time I wonder what'll be said in our time when others went it's not it's not for me and they went off of the scene many of them are dead now many of them are lost in utter Darkness but you're still standing how many of your friends that you parted with and then you turned around and tried to give this to them are you with me listen you can't give a predestinated seat but this ought to be something you can shout about this morning what held you what energized you what caused you to have a Revival in your soul that Satan can't put out I'll tell you that Eternal part of [Applause] you I want you to just think about this in Matthew chapter one and the Book of the generation of Jesus Christ the son of David the son of Abraham Abraham begat Isaac and Isaac begat Jacob and Jacob begat Judas and his Brethren and and Judas begat FZ and zarra of Tamar and FZ begat ezam and ezam begat amram and amram begat Amad it goes right on down to Salomon and Salomon begat Boaz of R of Rahab and you could just preach from right there you could just preach from right there how it looks so sinful and it looks so lost and it looked like a dead end for the lon of the tribe of Judah I'm doing something with this and it looked like it was so horrible and under such a situation how can a predestinated seed be a prostitute on the walls of Jericho but she was a part of the lion of tribe of Judah let me do it with now if we could look at your lineage if we could look at your lineage and it looks so so lost and so destroyed and so wicked and God preserved your seed brother Roger Wicked shout about that today God preserved your natural seed Hebrews chap 11 and verse one now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report stay with me through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the world word of God so that things which are seen were made of things which do appear every one of you rode this morning on the word of God you planted your corn in the word of God you planted your tomatoes in the word of God this that you're living on God knew where he would place you and the enemy tells you God don't love you he put your chemicals sister Beth he put your chemicals exactly where your mother would eat your body out of the ground because the cursed Earth she would eat your body out of this cursed Earth brother BR said he would do it like a contractor laying out two before us and and all of the building grounds to build a house God knew where your body would be laying in the earth and if he could do that with a cursed Earth how much more can he do with a glorified sheep now here's what I want you to do I want you to look over at your neighbor they are a vision of God you looked at your husband and you said that's absolutely right I wish I could have captured her smile when she looked at her husband I don't know if you caught it or not but she said you are aition I'm having too much fun here but it's all right are you with me now I want you to look at somebody else and I want you to go you're a vision that God had in his mind now I want you to understand you're looking at a body that is decaying and dying it's decaying and dying but God's got you a body and what you can't see when that neighbor's beside of you you can't see the Eternal part the Eternal part has got you here the Eternal part has brought you here and it took that decay in body and brought that Rascal that felt too tired to be in church or had a million things to do it told that rotten body get yourself in church Glory Glory Hallelujah here's what Satan do does he Wars against that body because he knows that that's the only chance he's got to win so let me get give you an idea he Wars with your flesh your feelings your memory your conscience and he Wars in that Dimension which he's allowed to do and he'll cause you to throw stones at one another I'm talking to you even on the internet he'll cause you to throw stones at one another because it's the only thing that he can do but if you will turn those stones on the [Applause] devil where that you have a right to destroy him instead of destroying one another listen we're going to spend to Eternity together so get over the stuff just get over it just get over [Applause] it brother these two boys back here I know you know they're Angels but probably all three let me just bring all three of you in it I'm I'm sure you was a stinker too but they would go I don't want to wear them clothes that mom had picked out for them I don't want to wear them or I don't want to eat that or they begin to fight one another and they would fight and we'd get them down and say now I want you to get down and pray there's people in Africa would love to have those clothes there's people in Jamaica would love to have what you're eating right now and their response always was send [Laughter] [Applause] it it was 100% always send it listen boys grow up so I'm looking out across an audience and the devil throws a lot of darts at you and gets you all worked over over stuff he gets you worked up over stuff I didn't get this done today and I didn't get this done today listen you're going to leave it amen you're going to leave it don't let it work you up that house that yard that job you're going to leave it it's all [Applause] temporary I'm so disappointed with my body you God's going to give you another one just keep praying just keep the victory you young guys don't know what I'm talking about there but you'll get there uh maybe not Psalms chapter 139 for thou possesses verse 13 for thou possesses my reign thou has covered me in my womb my mother's womb I will praise thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made David's talking about God's election for I am fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous are thy works that my soul knoweth right well notice this next verse my substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lower parts of the earth Thine Eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect and in the book all my members were written which in the continuous were fashioned when as yet there was none of them now notice this next verse how precious also are thou thoughts unto me oh God how great is the sum of them I'm going to skip some things because I'm brother B would say this and each one of these God's Eternal thought expressed in its season then we come to Jesus the logos he was perfect and complete thought expressed and became known as the word that is what he is and forever will be notice what he said the express thought but he's not the only expressed thought can I carry it just a little bit farther now it says that he hath chosen Us in him before the foundational world that means that we were right there with him in the mind and the thoughts of God before the foundation of the world that gives an eternal quality to the elect you can't get away from it woo what a thought brother Matthew brother Andrew you may have two but brother Andrew quoted this last night and I think it's worth repeating and that's the person that the new life start starts from from this new birth and it builds another person in the image of this person that you are around that life he said you get it so potentially it's in hereen what is it the word promis before the foundation of the world and around there this only reflects the negative and this reflects the positive the word and the same there the thing that it is the translation of the Bible will be the same thing the word that's in you the body will materialize around that word the same thing that it did by Sarah notice how he puts that Sarah got a transformation of her body but that body had to die but that transformation of your body won't die Hallelujah hallelujah it's quite quite awesome before when that old body she had the first body it had to be changed in order to produce the Sun and this body cannot do it it'll have to be changed the same to receive the sun oh God I need a body change notice what he says he said let me inject a thought in here even our natural birth was based upon election I love what he does with this the female ovaries produce many many eggs by by why it is that a certain time a certain egg comes down and another not another one and then amongst that male sperm for no known reason a certain germ attaches itself to the egg While others that could have just as easily attached themsel or or or had a better opportunity to do so and did not do so and they perished you talking about one in a million there is an intelligence behind all of this and otherwise what determines whether the baby is a boy or a girl or blonde or brunette or light or dark type of eyes with these thoughts in mind think about Joshua and Caleb did not Jesus say in John your fathers did eat Mana in the wilderness and are dead those parents died and were necessary for the forefathers of the people to whom Jesus was speaking they perished and yet there were the election of God naturally as Joshua and Caleb were listen we announce babies being born we would like to congratulate Hunter and to and Katie they're having a baby but we don't have a funeral for over 900,000 germ Seeds of Life we don't have a funeral and say I'm so sorry that you didn't make it we could say the same thing about every one of [Music] you almost a million CS died while you lived did you catch that just right there if God could do that to get you here in your natural birth you ought to be shouting right now if God could do that to get you here in your natural birth and protect you in your natural birth how much more you say well God never did anything to get you here to get you here before the foundational world he bypassed a million to get you and any son is the attributes of his father and just as you were in the genes of your father and the body of your father when he was a young boy you were you were in him so when Charlie was throwing rocks at a toilet scaring his brothers and sisters I was in him did you just catch what I did when my father was acting up and being an ugly boy I was in him let me take this a step further when my father was being an ugly boy you were in him and when my father was being an ugly boy you were in him and the children that you will produce they were in Charlie and before Charlie they were when Jesus was here your natural seed was being carried by somebody that's right in the earth Hallelujah and if God could watch over you all through this time are are you catching what I'm doing now now oh it's just about me you're not even seeing any of the picture that's right you're only seeing one pixel of the giant picture amen that's right is is that the right word pixel yeah you if you blow a picture up you can see one pixel you just keep blowing it up he gave a class the other day and that's how I got it and if you keep blowing the picture up it was all conglomerated made such a beautiful picture but just keep blowing it up you'll see one pixel but you're not looking at the whole picture if you're only looking at yourself you're missing a whole [Applause] lot what is it important for me to overcome your children your children's children your children's children's children amen [Applause] [Laughter] and so were you Sons and Daughters of god notice these words before there was even a moon or a star or a molecule you were Sons and Daughters of God I'm trying to behave before there was a son boy I love to see that son before there was a moon sometimes that Moon looks so big you could reach out and touch it before there was a Galaxy that was God's first Bible that brought the Zodiac in the heavens before any of that you was there are you catching it are you catching it now now God just don't start a job to quit it I'm trying to take my time here today when he was wri in his Bible in the heavens you were already there you were in the Lamb's Book before the son was created amen you know we try to study our our history I'm going to go and look in the Spencer history you're going to be disappointed am you thought you were royalty and you were actually slaves and you thought you was just you was some great general of some great man and you found out you were a private and you find out things about yourself when you dig it all the way back not exactly what you were expecting to be some of you get wonderful surprises but your heritage is much greater than natural man right did you just catch that what are you doing brother Ron I I seem to be bored through this if you just hang on just for a moment I'm going to tell you what you can do with this this information that I'm giving you in this first 30 minutes you can whip the devil next week and the week after and the week after and the week after if you can figure out where you came from now if you remember I love this quote he said that's the way God did this may be hard for to swallow he bred this one to that one and this one to that one God did that yep telling got exactly what he wanted and that's how he came down God revealed himself in a pillar of fire brother Ron you mean that God caused my great great grandmother to fall in love with my great great grandfather and he may have had a nose that long he may have been cross- sided as a bullfrog he may have stunk like a mule and your grandmother was a beautiful woman but there was something inside of that man there was something inside of that man that she fell in love with come on cuz God was causing them to Brother Ray I love this God was causing them to fall in love because he needed you to look like you cuz you're going to be the Tabernacle that he's going to live in but brother Ron I'm only 5 foot tall yep be glad you're five foot you could have been 4 fo8 my great great grandmother was 4 fo8 my great grandfa my grandfather was 5 foot tall my grandmother was 5 foot tall my mother's 5 foot tall I'm thrilled to be 5' five yeah I was thinking about that when I was reaching for for richz crackers last night after service knowing that this was in my notes I didn't stand there and complain I went and got Connie's tools that she's got over there and those things that what do you call them things that you yeah you and you reach and you grab a hold gave me an extra foot and I reached up there and reached is that a word in the English language I reached up there and I grab those Rich crackers down Amen brother Josh you wouldn't have the problem but if you standing there i' say Josh could you reach and get them RIT crackers but there's times that I walk through a door I don't have to duck but he [Applause] does brother Josh I was I was uh in Canada this week and somebody walked up to me and said how tall is brother Josh I said I think he's probably 65 66 how much does he weigh I said that's above my pay [Laughter] grade brother Ron he made you look like a little bitty boy yes he does want some but God watched over my seed that I would be exactly this height so why should I complain about being 5 foot five and why should brother Josh complained about being 65 God made us fearfully and wonderfully made now this is especially for you guys God Made You exactly the way that you are well brother Ron I can't wait to get married don't be in such a hurry don't be in such a hurry well brother Ron but you know I'm I'm I'm 23 years old and I'm almost past the flower of age your husband may be [Applause] 12 now I will get in trouble marrying you with your 12-year-old husband brother Ron I need an example well look at the back row there's brother Joe and there's sister ruthanne amen Joe would have got incredible trouble being 22 and marrying a 10-year-old May is am I right am I close am I on target so God watches over your natural seat come on help me preach now I've been carnal for a minute to get your thoughts where you need to be listen God knows how to make you the way you are are you with me so simply wait on God Abraham was childless Sarah was childless no children but they did not understand the potential that was laying inside of them that's right and they were praying for a child they were desperate and God spoke to them you're going to have a child you're going to have a son through Sarah now let me just say this to you if you were in that boat you're looking maybe at the natural so God's got to have a sermon by brother Ron to tell you quit looking at the natural so he takes you to the sand of the sea and he said Abraham can you count them now you that go to a beach let me just remind you what Abraham was looking at can you count the sand particles on just the beach that you're standing now I'm going to take you further than that what about every beach in the world can you count the sand part articles on every one of them it must have blowed his mind so shall thy seed B go ahead and steal that that that's a good one one night it's a very clear I like really clear nights where there's no pollution or no fog or no clouds and you get to a high place where you can't see the the great big lights of Gros and you're looking into the night it looks like you could see all the stars well you're not you're not even seeing you're not hardly seeing a a quarter of them and God says Abraham can you count the Stars of the heaven and they're only what he can see so shall thy seat be here's where I want to come to we're going to spend eternity together we're going to spend eternity together I want you to look at your neighbor say we're going to spend eternity together now that's more sister Beth that's more than six hours a week and what Abraham was looking at is going to be there and more than just what he looked up at we're going to be there I was one of those particles of sand or one of those stars that were in the heaven I was one of them I could not be displayed in Jesus's hour Paul's hour you get the point but I had to be manifested in this hour I had to be manifested in this hour and so God pre-plans you yes pre-planned you to be born in this day cuz he needed you maybe to not go down in faith and by death but he needed somebody that would believe this message so much come on are you with me let me just go further a little bit further God W watched over Samson's birth you can trace it through the scripture God watched over Samuel's birth he watched over Moses's birth let me spend a minute right here remember this when they put him in that in that crocodile infested water in that in that bull rush they put him in a basket put tar on the bottom of it covered it up some way they couldn't see the angels of God watching over they couldn't see Gabriel stand on top of that on top of that basket I'm not going to be much longer now they couldn't see Gabriel standing there and thousands of angels watching over but a prophet of God in this day could look back and pick it out of the scriptures and hear the instructions of God hear the instructions of God say Gabriel stand on that Ark and every time a crocodile comes up and tries to bite it you push your foot down down on him and push it away and when he starts getting in whirl pools listen get him out of the whirl pools of Life brother Ron that was Moses what about you you've never been alone whether you was in school whether you was in colleg where you was alone on your job angels have been dispatched oh because of what's deposited in your seed brother Ron do you mean when an was so crazy over Elis Presley and climbing a tree to see if she could see him do you mean that God was watching over her listen angels have went a lot of Dark Places David when you was going places that you wouldn't even want to tell children about the angels of God was watching over you when you guys were dumpster diving the angels of God was watching up brother Jim when you was in the Navy the angels of God was watching over you not because of you but because of that predestinated seed preach brother amen I've got it here little man's got a suit on today yeah got a suit on we're going to get a picture a little bit later together but when they told you you couldn't have children God had his name Hallelujah amen you cried you prayed I remember those days you thought it would never happen but there was a vision given to your daddy that you was going to have a child going to be a boy going to have a Disney shirt on and going to have his left hand up in the air are you with me now God knows your future are you with me God knows your future when I was marrying you two as a couple God knew Teddy was coming are you with me God knows he knows he knows he knows when he showed me the vision of Isaac being born the way that he was born when it was impossible and then Here Comes Zoe along all sass God needed her not to speak cuz she needed to live the first couple years of her life but when it seemed like she wasn't going to get better God came on the sun and loosed her tongue brother Ron this seems really far out we serve the god that can look at an apple seed and tell you how many apples and how many trees that that seed will produce woo woo woo I'm just letting off some steam CU I got to finish amen we had a phenomenal Miracle here in Co was 10 of us here about 10 of us for a long time I didn't get to come because of cancer but I need some names these guys started coming and you guys came to church forgive forgive me for not being able to call your name right now but Paul you guys came to church it must have been awkward you came to a church that had 10 people I I'd like to talk to y'all sometime about that you came to church and this was all that was here and you came every service you came and sat down now you would come in but after service started sister relle you must have you must have thought it came to me you must have thought boy there's just hardly any sisters in this church covid regulations we could only we could only have 10 and then and then we started half of the church half came this Sunday and half will come next Sunday how thrilling that was that you now had half of the church with you amen but now you look around and go I got to find a seat and that seat keeps moving so and I'm ending now God for 2,000 years has been building a city amen it's 1500 mil high and 1500 mil wide it's not a box it's a pyramid amen and brother brandom he said he's so great in his architect until walking up that mountain you'll feel like you're walking on flat ground and he would describe that your piece of property had the River of Life flowing through it amen and he said there's going to be parks and avenues streets of gold walls of Jasper and he's going to be at the top of the city because he lights it all up Amen brother Shannon you look like you're flat on fire this morning and I've did everything to preach around you but here it is is so when you were way back Yonder and you couldn't see who you were but now you can God has been designing a a place for you in that City now let's just describe this you're living in a ranch house here and you go I think we're going to need four bedrooms and then you have eight children no I'm not talking about you I'm talking about [Laughter] Jordan and sometimes as man we build a house and then we mean more room and we build on and we build on Connie and myself we become empty nesters and then we went while building our house and thank God we're not adding on to our family listen I could dismiss and Shout the rest of the afternoon but I want you to think how we think in our mortality and it's hard for us to think in the Eternal realm if God could think of you in the Eternal realm and you look at it in Mortal realm and you build a house but God builds it much differently you say well brother Ron how do you know that I go to prepare a place for you that where I am there you may be also and brother Bram said in future home he built it just to your liking amen amen listen and you don't even know you're liking brother Ron I know what I like well why do you keep changing colors I see you I see you looking over there well you and Charles made decisions on what color you wanted all your re rooms guarante you they already have plants yeah she's shaking her head amen so we don't even know what we like but in that Immortal Realm yes sir I may not look like it but I feel like jumping to the Moon in that Eternal realm where the lamb is the light and he fixes everything these hands will look new there will be no more blood spots on these hands and there'll be no more cancer Hey listen that'll be enough where it's heaven and if you see me take off run and go wonder how far he's going to go don't worry I'm not going to wear wear out and my shoes are going to be perfect and my knees are not going to get aching and my ankles are not going to hurt listen I may be running for a while and if you think that I shout down here just wait if you think I'm noisy down here just wait Glory Glory when all those dust and all those stars are manifested on that day we are going to have an oldfashioned shouting time it's going to be more than a song shouting time and Glory let's stand to our feet this morning well I got two two pages looks like I'll have to come back again next Sunday Hallelujah don't you love the Lord a it's so wonderful isn't it so wonderful this is not just another service not just another service if God knew you then he knows you now and he'll know you in the future don't you love him don't you just love him brother Ron I'd like to see a vision shake your neighbor's
