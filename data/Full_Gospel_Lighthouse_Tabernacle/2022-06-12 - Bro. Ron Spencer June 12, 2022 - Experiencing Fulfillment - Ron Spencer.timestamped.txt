[56:41] amen god bless you we're so glad to have
[56:44] brother roger and sister anne
[56:58] we've got many new ones here but brother
[57:00] rogers been a pillar at this church for
[57:04] for decades and
[57:06] and
[57:07] just because of people that are
[57:10] get a little bit older and and doctors
[57:12] tell them don't come don't mean they're
[57:14] still not pillars and so
[57:17] brother roger watches every service it's
[57:19] with you he pays his tithes all of that
[57:21] business and he's a real friend to me
[57:24] and
[57:24] and brother homer just because we're in
[57:27] different dimensions don't mean we're
[57:28] not friends and pillars and all of those
[57:30] kind of things and so
[57:33] their family has got some bad news is it
[57:35] okay to share their family's got some
[57:38] bad news and that's
[57:39] their daughter debbie
[57:41] and uh how old is debbie
[57:47] 60.
[57:49] wow my age
[57:51] amen i had her a lot younger than that
[57:53] but she's 60 years old she found out in
[57:56] the last just days
[57:59] that she has uterus cancer
[58:01] liver cancer and pancreas cancer
[58:06] you and all you and i all know
[58:10] just to hear those words
[58:12] uh sends a dread or a fear or
[58:16] just a little torment
[58:19] among you and it just uh
[58:22] i know
[58:23] it sends it sends a torment among you
[58:25] because without the hand of god it's a
[58:27] death sentence
[58:29] we're we're grown-ups here without the
[58:31] hands of gods it's a death sentence and
[58:33] so
[58:35] these organs are very much needed
[58:38] generally when it's said pancreas cancer
[58:41] whether you're the president or or some
[58:43] hollywood star
[58:45] that gets the best in the world
[58:47] there's just not much that they can do
[58:50] but we happen to have a different source
[58:56] we have a different source we have a
[58:58] different doctor
[58:59] and that doctor's jesus
[59:03] now now let me just say this to you
[59:04] sometimes we get ahead of god and we we
[59:07] we get a conclusion
[59:09] but what if you'd have got a head of god
[59:11] with lazarus
[59:18] and four days late

[1:09:02] let's talk to the lord
[1:09:04] lord jesus we love you tonight
[1:09:07] and are so incredibly thankful for what
[1:09:10] you have done
[1:09:12] lord we have watched the events of the
[1:09:14] last few weeks
[1:09:16] within the bride
[1:09:17] not just within the bride but the world
[1:09:20] is taking shape
[1:09:22] prophecy being fulfilled daily
[1:09:25] things that are happening
[1:09:27] the bride is in revival like never
[1:09:30] before
[1:09:31] your supernatural hand satan fighting
[1:09:33] against us with everything that he can
[1:09:36] because he realizes
[1:09:38] just like this scripture is saying
[1:09:41] we are at the end of the end
[1:09:45] we're the final voice to the final age
[1:09:48] and we realize that all the prophecies
[1:09:52] have come to this point
[1:09:54] it's a going home time for us
[1:09:57] and lord will will slip out of here
[1:10:00] and lord while we're here let us shine
[1:10:03] the light to a dark and dying
[1:10:06] age
[1:10:07] lord they won't realize that they've
[1:10:09] slipped into tribulation
[1:10:13] be no messenger there to tell them that
[1:10:15] the tribulation has started it will have
[1:10:18] just slipped into that
[1:10:20] but there was a messenger that came that
[1:10:22] told us of these events that would
[1:10:24] happen
[1:10:25] now sharpen our attention
[1:10:28] catch our hearts minister to our needs
[1:10:31] even as i stand here and preach today
[1:10:34] anoint our lips for our hearts for
[1:10:37] rapture
[1:10:38] lord may we be ready
[1:10:42] may we be on the mark
[1:10:45] like never before father
[1:10:48] speak to our hearts now
[1:10:50] in jesus christ's name we pray
[1:10:53] a man
[1:10:54] and a man and a man you may be seated
[1:11:07] last week we went to brother ray
[1:11:09] erickson's to speak
[1:11:15] and on thursday morning just before
[1:11:17] going there
[1:11:19] i had prayed i had dedicated time to
[1:11:22] prepare for that meeting
[1:11:24] and i felt it was going in a certain
[1:11:26] direction and then on thursday morning
[1:11:29] the lord woke me up
[1:11:33] it was at 406
[1:11:35] i looked over at the clock and
[1:11:37] and i heard the voice of the lord
[1:11:40] and he spoke to me these words
[1:11:43] experiencing
[1:11:45] fulfillment
[1:11:49] experiencing fulfillment
[1:11:53] and then the third time he spoke to me
[1:11:56] again
[1:11:57] experiencing fulfillment
[1:12:00] any minister that's got any salt to him
[1:12:03] immediately knows that that's not his
[1:12:05] thoughts that's god's thoughts
[1:12:07] and god wants to say something
[1:12:10] and so i quickly
[1:12:12] at that time in the morning begin to
[1:12:15] begin to make notes and thoughts and
[1:12:19] while that presence was in the room and
[1:12:22] then just a bit later i would i would i
[1:12:24] would lay back down and
[1:12:26] and i would fall asleep and the lord
[1:12:28] would give me a dream
[1:12:30] and that dream would give me direction
[1:12:32] for
[1:12:33] for the next coming months
[1:12:35] and later i will share that with my
[1:12:37] family that's more of a family thing to
[1:12:39] share not a world thing to share
[1:12:42] but i would get a visitation in that
[1:12:44] dream
[1:12:47] i i just as as i began to look at these
[1:12:50] things and then look what happened we
[1:12:52] went to
[1:12:53] to brother wayne's and
[1:12:55] house and
[1:12:56] brother wayne was hosting us on
[1:12:59] on the evening of saturday afternoon we
[1:13:01] would only speak
[1:13:02] sunday morning
[1:13:04] and brother
[1:13:07] brother ray was sitting beside of me his
[1:13:09] basically his family was sitting there
[1:13:12] in the room and it was actually two
[1:13:14] rooms and and there was the sisters were
[1:13:17] there the brothers were there don't i
[1:13:19] don't have an idea maybe 40 people was
[1:13:21] in the room and
[1:13:23] and some children that was there
[1:13:26] and brother ray just asked me a question
[1:13:28] about the supernatural
[1:13:30] and we just begin to talk about the
[1:13:33] supernatural for just a bit and as we
[1:13:36] begin to talk
[1:13:38] it just dropped
[1:13:42] it just dropped it felt like the hair on
[1:13:44] my head caught on fire it felt like the
[1:13:46] presence of god was consumed
[1:13:49] and it felt like you didn't want to say
[1:13:50] a word out of place
[1:13:54] we're not here to recreate that because
[1:13:56] that same presence is already
[1:13:58] here and
[1:14:01] brother ray began to speak in tongues
[1:14:05] one by one individuals got a word from
[1:14:08] the lord for them
[1:14:10] it was not a dry eye in the room
[1:14:14] and then brother wayne had a request and
[1:14:18] and we began to pray
[1:14:22] tongues were being spoken
[1:14:25] of a heavenly language
[1:14:28] and
[1:14:29] and that that event was just
[1:14:31] life-changing
[1:14:33] now
[1:14:34] only just a couple of weeks before that
[1:14:37] we had been with
[1:14:39] with brother biskell and brother tim
[1:14:41] pruitt brother michael ray
[1:14:43] and then there was several people that
[1:14:45] were there
[1:14:46] matthew was there
[1:14:48] uh there was quite a few that was in the
[1:14:50] room and
[1:14:51] it was kind of the same setting
[1:14:54] and we just begin to to talk about
[1:14:56] supernatural things
[1:14:59] and things that had happened with us
[1:15:02] things that would happen with brother
[1:15:04] tim
[1:15:05] with a little drew that that
[1:15:07] conversation would be then sister karen
[1:15:11] how god has been with us through cancer
[1:15:14] brother biscuit would be making comments
[1:15:17] and
[1:15:18] and after just about 20 minutes eat
[1:15:22] about 20 minutes of that presence being
[1:15:24] there he he just said
[1:15:27] many years ago i was in a presence like
[1:15:29] this
[1:15:31] and we were sitting at the table with
[1:15:33] brother branham
[1:15:35] and he said i'll tell you that pillar of
[1:15:37] fire brother branham said that pillar of
[1:15:39] fire is hanging about two feet from us
[1:15:44] brother biscuit said that same presence
[1:15:46] is here
[1:15:47] then that same presence was at the table
[1:15:50] with at brother wayne's house
[1:15:53] i want that presence at my house
[1:15:58] and i say that because it comes
[1:16:01] he's welcome anytime
[1:16:03] [Music]
[1:16:04] not just at the house but in this church
[1:16:08] i want it for your homes
[1:16:11] when these people were asked to get
[1:16:13] their get their lamb ready it had to be
[1:16:15] perfect it had to be a certain way blood
[1:16:18] had to be on the door because the angel
[1:16:21] was passing by
[1:16:23] the death angel was passing and listen
[1:16:26] life after today it wasn't going to
[1:16:28] never be the same
[1:16:30] for those egyptian people their oldest
[1:16:33] child was going to perish that night
[1:16:35] because they had rejected the message
[1:16:46] whatever nation you're listening to
[1:16:50] whether you're sitting in switzerland or
[1:16:52] in ireland
[1:16:56] wherever you're at listening to this
[1:16:57] message today i want you to understand
[1:17:01] because this world has turned down the
[1:17:03] message
[1:17:08] we're preparing to leave
[1:17:13] this message
[1:17:15] it's rapture message
[1:17:18] this message turned abraham and sarah
[1:17:21] back young again
[1:17:23] that's a type that there were a people
[1:17:25] that were going to receive this
[1:17:27] melchizedek of this age
[1:17:29] this mighty angel of this day that would
[1:17:33] stand at the pulpit
[1:17:35] night after night after not
[1:17:38] let me just say you said well brother
[1:17:40] ron i'm looking for vindication today
[1:17:42] you are the vindication
[1:17:48] god will not send another messenger he's
[1:17:51] already came
[1:17:56] but as he began to speak those words to
[1:17:58] me
[1:17:59] experiencing fulfillment
[1:18:03] experiencing
[1:18:04] fulfillment
[1:18:07] i begin to realize that we're no longer
[1:18:09] just looking for things to happen
[1:18:13] i want you to be real conscious with me
[1:18:16] we're no longer just looking for things
[1:18:18] to happen
[1:18:19] or one day
[1:18:22] or i just hope i'm here or i i
[1:18:26] it's happening
[1:18:30] and it's like an enoch walk
[1:18:35] it's like a rebecca ride with elijah
[1:18:42] the word is carrying you
[1:18:46] the dress fits
[1:18:50] it's not you having to make yourself do
[1:18:52] anything we're not a religious order
[1:18:56] [Music]
[1:18:58] we're not just another church
[1:19:01] we are the bride of jesus christ
[1:19:05] and we've been married to him by a
[1:19:08] message of the hour
[1:19:10] that has put us in position
[1:19:16] now
[1:19:17] i want you to stay with me
[1:19:22] we realize that dimensions are blending
[1:19:27] we realize that
[1:19:29] the world has fallen apart
[1:19:33] but this is the result
[1:19:36] what you're seeing today on our streets
[1:19:39] is the results
[1:19:42] of seeds that have been sowed
[1:19:46] for a hundred
[1:19:48] years and now the harvest is in our
[1:19:52] cities it's in our schools
[1:19:56] it's in our communities
[1:20:00] you could put an abraham lincoln and a
[1:20:02] george washington in every county in
[1:20:06] america it won't turn it around
[1:20:18] brother branham said he said
[1:20:21] our children and grandchildren will
[1:20:23] never pay off the tax debt that they're
[1:20:26] spending
[1:20:29] i'd say that's true today
[1:20:33] we have spent so far until there's no
[1:20:35] way to ever unspend it
[1:20:43] blame can be placed in a lot of
[1:20:44] different directions
[1:20:48] a lot of directions it can be and we are
[1:20:50] now experiencing i'm trying to kind of
[1:20:54] bring you into it
[1:20:56] when you go to the gas station your
[1:20:59] experiencing
[1:21:02] amen and maybe you don't have an idea of
[1:21:04] why you're experiencing that is
[1:21:07] it's because
[1:21:09] men have made the decision that they're
[1:21:11] going to put windmills
[1:21:15] and they're going to put solar panels
[1:21:18] and america's going to be run by a
[1:21:20] battery
[1:21:23] well they tried that in the 1900s and
[1:21:25] about the 1910s and it didn't work
[1:21:30] it just didn't work
[1:21:32] but you see the seed of that never died
[1:21:36] and as people
[1:21:38] we face the penalty
[1:21:41] of billionaires making choices
[1:21:46] don't freeze up on me
[1:21:51] many people sit in churches
[1:21:56] and their churches are dead
[1:21:59] and maybe they're even mega churches
[1:22:03] and their churches have lost grip
[1:22:06] lost their moral compass
[1:22:10] they have they don't have any strength
[1:22:13] for revival
[1:22:16] you'll never turn around how women dress
[1:22:18] in those places
[1:22:20] you'll never turn out
[1:22:25] you'll never turn around the ministry
[1:22:28] where the god moves from the front to
[1:22:31] the back
[1:22:34] so you have to manufacture programs and
[1:22:38] you have to manufacture worship
[1:22:41] by worship teens
[1:22:44] you have to have a you have to have the
[1:22:46] old traditional music for for certain
[1:22:49] classes and you have to have
[1:22:50] contemporary music for a certain class
[1:22:54] [Music]
[1:22:55] you can't buy a lawnmower without a
[1:22:58] voting system take place
[1:23:00] preacher preaches too long they'll get
[1:23:02] rid of him after a while if he doesn't
[1:23:04] have a certain style if he doesn't have
[1:23:06] a certain manner about him they'll move
[1:23:09] him on after a while
[1:23:11] but the reason they've done that they
[1:23:13] moved god on
[1:23:15] [Applause]
[1:23:17] [Music]
[1:23:21] ichabod is written over the door
[1:23:27] and it says the presence of god
[1:23:30] has departed
[1:23:33] brother branham walked to the pulpit and
[1:23:35] he preached blasphemous names this is
[1:23:37] not going to be one of his most popular
[1:23:39] messages
[1:23:42] and he will name denominational systems
[1:23:44] that went off without god
[1:23:47] they crucified the word again afresh
[1:23:51] and said god don't do miracles no more
[1:23:55] and he began to go down through how that
[1:23:57] they're not looking
[1:23:59] for even an elijah in this day amen
[1:24:09] what they did was they didn't understand
[1:24:11] it
[1:24:12] but they were experiencing
[1:24:15] fulfillment
[1:24:19] they were sitting in a pew
[1:24:22] watching their church died
[1:24:30] they were watching their church die
[1:24:35] they were watching their church change
[1:24:43] brother random was here
[1:24:46] when there was just less than one
[1:24:48] percent
[1:24:50] to said take prayer out of school
[1:24:56] elijah was here
[1:24:59] elijah was here
[1:25:02] so was some other kings here
[1:25:05] martin luther king was here
[1:25:07] elvis presley was here
[1:25:09] john f kennedy was here there were a lot
[1:25:11] of things that were going on when
[1:25:12] brother branham was here and at the same
[1:25:15] time of all of that the seals were being
[1:25:18] released
[1:25:20] you see the world's going to do what
[1:25:22] it's going to do
[1:25:24] they're going to make their decisions
[1:25:26] the outside noise is going to do theirs
[1:25:28] but god's got a plan
[1:25:32] [Applause]
[1:25:34] and they tried to take prayer out of
[1:25:37] schools
[1:25:39] but listen it didn't stop there
[1:25:43] it didn't stop there they took prayer
[1:25:46] out of the government
[1:25:48] and then they took the prayer out of
[1:25:51] churches
[1:25:53] and too many people has taken prayer out
[1:25:55] of homes i pray that's never your
[1:25:57] situation in your life
[1:26:04] backsliding is not drinking smoking
[1:26:06] cheating and lying and stealing
[1:26:09] backsliding is quit feeding the fire
[1:26:11] that's in your life
[1:26:14] it's getting satisfied getting numb by
[1:26:18] the world
[1:26:20] and its system
[1:26:25] brother branham would make a state but
[1:26:27] he said
[1:26:28] he'd call it don't be numb
[1:26:33] numbness
[1:26:34] he'd also say
[1:26:37] paralyzing your faith
[1:26:41] call it dull of hearing
[1:26:46] maybe we could say distracted by the
[1:26:48] world
[1:26:50] i remember brother dan daisley coming to
[1:26:52] this pulpit
[1:26:54] we came and set for just another service
[1:26:56] and brother dan walked through the back
[1:26:58] of the of the building he walked in no
[1:27:00] town he just walked in his jovial self
[1:27:04] i said
[1:27:05] where'd you've been
[1:27:07] i said what are you doing here he said i
[1:27:09] just come through he said well when did
[1:27:10] you get here he said well i've been here
[1:27:12] all week he said i just came to relax
[1:27:14] stayed in a hotel he said i thought i'd
[1:27:16] come have service without such good
[1:27:18] you're preaching
[1:27:22] he said okay
[1:27:24] he walked out here
[1:27:26] you know the story you've been here for
[1:27:28] a while you walked out here
[1:27:30] and he began to preach to us
[1:27:32] and he made an announcement to us
[1:27:37] my wife is having an affair
[1:27:42] this audience has sent a shockwave
[1:27:46] you could just feel it from the front to
[1:27:48] the back
[1:27:51] and as he began to preach we realized
[1:27:54] real quickly it wasn't his wife
[1:27:56] but it was
[1:28:03] it was like eve having an affair on adam
[1:28:07] it was like pentecost becoming catholic
[1:28:12] and if we're not careful we'll start
[1:28:14] looking at another lover
[1:28:17] [Applause]
[1:28:19] are you with me
[1:28:20] you can't love god and love the world at
[1:28:22] the same time it just don't work out
[1:28:27] sitting on a fence just don't work out
[1:28:34] like that sermon aaron spoke i think he
[1:28:37] spoke it in
[1:28:38] ohio
[1:28:39] on empty fences
[1:28:43] you got to make a decision somewhere
[1:28:45] another
[1:28:46] we didn't realize that this would be
[1:28:48] brother dan's last sermon to preach
[1:28:52] he would walk out of here it would be
[1:28:54] his last sermon here but he was saying
[1:28:57] something
[1:28:58] to this audience
[1:29:02] don't be found with another lover
[1:29:06] brother homer his last sermon was being
[1:29:09] there for ready in sichuan hours you
[1:29:12] think not
[1:29:15] sometimes we come to church we sit there
[1:29:16] and we think well this is the way it's
[1:29:18] always going to be
[1:29:20] i made the statement as i was standing
[1:29:23] in front of probably 400 people at
[1:29:25] brother ray erickson's
[1:29:27] knowing the condition of where where
[1:29:29] we're at in life
[1:29:31] have no promise of being able to be
[1:29:32] there next year after 29 years of
[1:29:35] preaching there no promise that i'll
[1:29:37] have enough strength to be there next
[1:29:38] year to do that but listen while we're
[1:29:41] here
[1:29:44] in this moment that we're here let's
[1:29:46] take advantage
[1:29:49] and as i begin to make some statements
[1:29:51] this may be your last service
[1:29:54] they didn't know that charlie and rachel
[1:29:57] charlie was sitting right there charlie
[1:29:59] and rachel was getting ready to go to
[1:30:01] heaven
[1:30:03] that theophany body that we sing about
[1:30:05] was getting ready to pick them up
[1:30:08] god's not dainty whether we go by a car
[1:30:10] wreck or whether we go by cancer or
[1:30:12] whether we go by a fire he's not gaining
[1:30:21] saying that sometimes we glorify death
[1:30:24] we sing about death we glorify it we
[1:30:26] worship it
[1:30:28] and let me let me just just tell you
[1:30:30] here
[1:30:33] cancer is not going to kill me
[1:30:40] fourth stage cancer it's not going to
[1:30:42] kill me
[1:30:44] the day that god decides to bring me
[1:30:47] home
[1:30:48] cancer will have absolutely nothing to
[1:30:50] do with it
[1:30:56] so i don't fear cancer
[1:30:59] or the sugar
[1:31:00] i don't fear that
[1:31:02] to worship cancer is like worshiping a
[1:31:06] taxicab
[1:31:12] worshiping cancer is like worshiping a
[1:31:14] taxicab
[1:31:17] none of us in our rightful mind
[1:31:22] want to worship a taxicab
[1:31:27] so don't worship the cancer
[1:31:29] don't worship the heart attack
[1:31:32] because god's greater than all of that
[1:31:36] and death only changes your dwelling
[1:31:39] place
[1:31:40] [Applause]
[1:31:41] and death can't come a second too early
[1:31:44] until god says all right now go move him
[1:31:46] go moving from that house to this house
[1:31:50] go move him from that wretched pest
[1:31:52] house
[1:31:53] to this house where he'll never suffer
[1:31:56] again he'll never agonize again he'll
[1:31:59] never have another problem again
[1:32:02] he'll never age another day
[1:32:05] satan can't never touch him again
[1:32:24] worshiping death is kind of like getting
[1:32:26] in an uber a car
[1:32:28] and trying to figure out the life story
[1:32:30] to the driver
[1:32:35] all of my concern is
[1:32:41] is you get me from point a
[1:32:43] to point b
[1:32:45] i don't need to know how many kids you
[1:32:47] have
[1:32:48] i don't need
[1:32:54] on church let's preach
[1:33:00] death fell
[1:33:03] from heaven
[1:33:06] it fell from heaven
[1:33:08] when god said let there be light there
[1:33:11] was darkness
[1:33:12] darkness is only the antitype to tell us
[1:33:16] how great our god is
[1:33:23] amen
[1:33:26] so we realize that there are certain
[1:33:28] events
[1:33:29] that we experience
[1:33:31] that has been pre-ordained
[1:33:37] and you start experiencing them
[1:33:40] and you know sometimes
[1:33:43] we're sitting in a service and don't
[1:33:44] realize that god is being the very
[1:33:46] discerner of our thoughts and the
[1:33:49] intents of our heart
[1:33:52] and he's come to our kitchen he's come
[1:33:54] to our bedroom he's come to where we
[1:33:56] pray
[1:33:57] and he's answering our prayer
[1:34:00] and we're thinking about how long the
[1:34:01] preacher has preached
[1:34:07] or who's here or who's not here
[1:34:12] i learned a long time ago i preached to
[1:34:14] the people that are here
[1:34:18] and who's not here
[1:34:20] i'm not i'm you know they're just going
[1:34:22] to do their own deal
[1:34:26] but we're going to have church
[1:34:33] so let's just suppose let's do it this
[1:34:35] way
[1:34:36] brother branham has preached uh let's go
[1:34:39] patriarch abraham
[1:34:41] and so he's just preached and and he's
[1:34:43] just talked about abraham and the
[1:34:44] promise to abraham and el shaddai and
[1:34:47] all of these these parts of the sermon
[1:34:50] and he said now let's turn from
[1:34:51] evangelistic work says this by direct
[1:34:54] quote let's turn from a
[1:34:56] evangelistic work to a prophetic work
[1:34:59] now i want to caution you right here for
[1:35:01] those that have never heard some of
[1:35:03] these things i want to say this to you
[1:35:05] there wasn't another charismatic
[1:35:07] preacher in the world
[1:35:10] and there's never been one since jesus
[1:35:13] christ that had a messiah gift
[1:35:18] or messiah sign
[1:35:20] like god showed this generation
[1:35:23] but it was to get your attention
[1:35:25] that you would hear the thunders
[1:35:28] and hear the seals
[1:35:30] and hear the prophetic word
[1:35:33] it was more than just to call a patient
[1:35:36] up and tell them their condition well
[1:35:38] let's just say you're the patient
[1:35:42] and you've handed in your cart
[1:35:44] tuberculosis
[1:35:46] or whatever your disease was
[1:35:49] and you're standing there brother danny
[1:35:51] you're standing there
[1:35:53] and you're standing just feet and
[1:35:54] brother brown says now now don't be
[1:35:56] afraid of that
[1:35:58] that presence between you and i is him
[1:36:04] and he would tell us many times when
[1:36:05] that presence comes around that's him
[1:36:07] you just ask for more of him
[1:36:10] don't be afraid of that that's him
[1:36:12] that's him in your home that's when
[1:36:14] you're praying you feel him come that's
[1:36:16] him don't you be afraid of that
[1:36:19] it's a good time to repent too
[1:36:21] the zeal of this age is to repent i'm
[1:36:24] sorry for the things that i've made
[1:36:25] mistakes and then
[1:36:27] and then
[1:36:28] he began to talk to him and maybe he
[1:36:30] would turn and they're standing their
[1:36:33] feet from them maybe they've been
[1:36:35] suffering this with this for decades
[1:36:39] and they're standing there in front of
[1:36:41] him
[1:36:42] and they've been to tons of doctors
[1:36:44] spent incredible amounts of money
[1:36:47] nobody's given hope now they're standing
[1:36:50] and they're standing there and now that
[1:36:52] prophet turns and maybe calls out
[1:36:54] somebody over here somebody over there
[1:36:57] and somebody over there and it comes
[1:36:58] back to no you're the patient yes yes
[1:37:00] yes i am
[1:37:02] and begins to talk about the woman at
[1:37:04] the well
[1:37:06] maybe talks about
[1:37:07] blind bartimaeus what he's doing is he's
[1:37:10] raising the faith of that audience
[1:37:14] and taking them back to the same messiah
[1:37:16] son that was there with abraham and
[1:37:18] sarah
[1:37:20] are you with me
[1:37:22] because god is amen in the hour and a
[1:37:24] half sermon that he's just preached
[1:37:28] now if god don't do this may he strike
[1:37:30] me dead you heard him say that over and
[1:37:33] over again
[1:37:35] for the critics you need to re-listen to
[1:37:37] that
[1:37:40] so
[1:37:42] so are you the patient yes
[1:37:46] i see you your name is so-and-so yes
[1:37:52] you're you're
[1:37:53] you're not from here you're from this
[1:37:55] place that's right
[1:37:57] that's right you've been to a doctor
[1:37:58] that's right
[1:38:00] and then go right down the line
[1:38:04] one person
[1:38:06] 22 different things
[1:38:11] if he's wrong one time
[1:38:14] it blows it all away
[1:38:21] well i don't know so much about that it
[1:38:23] did to that patient
[1:38:27] you know you could have critics all over
[1:38:28] the building it's not for you no way
[1:38:32] this is not for the unbeliever
[1:38:36] you know you may have friends that say
[1:38:37] well i they don't want to come to church
[1:38:39] it don't matter
[1:38:41] well they don't see what i see it don't
[1:38:43] matter it's for you
[1:38:45] [Applause]
[1:38:56] here's a girl she's blonde head is
[1:38:58] sitting right here
[1:38:59] all right raise your hand right there
[1:39:01] she'd never been around any kind of
[1:39:03] thing like this
[1:39:05] and she meets a boy
[1:39:07] and she starts coming she's she's riding
[1:39:09] four hours
[1:39:10] for these services
[1:39:13] she could stay at home
[1:39:15] and just blow this off and say i'll see
[1:39:17] you when you get back home i'll see you
[1:39:19] monday but there's something on the
[1:39:21] inside of you
[1:39:24] that's causing you to really like this
[1:39:28] in that ride
[1:39:29] that's right
[1:39:32] there he goes your
[1:39:38] answer and he's going to make everything
[1:39:40] work for you good
[1:39:42] he's going to do that for you
[1:39:51] that's nice isn't it
[1:39:57] now that patient
[1:40:00] she's standing there
[1:40:04] and she may not feel nothing
[1:40:06] and brother brown will go now you go
[1:40:08] believing
[1:40:11] maybe walk off of that stage with
[1:40:13] incredible disease
[1:40:15] and in a few days she begins to notice
[1:40:18] i'm not sick anymore
[1:40:24] i'm not sick anymore
[1:40:26] i i i'm not sick anymore i feel good
[1:40:30] and it begins to confess
[1:40:32] that by his stripes i'm healed
[1:40:36] and there's not a devil in hell that can
[1:40:38] stop that and she just begins to confess
[1:40:41] now all of us has got a human grab bag
[1:40:44] of weaknesses in our humanity as we
[1:40:47] begin to get older and things begin to
[1:40:49] happen in our lives and we begin to
[1:40:51] deteriorate
[1:40:53] but god's still a healer
[1:41:00] sister whitney we said this the other
[1:41:02] day sister whitney had which spent
[1:41:04] thousands and thousands of dollars and
[1:41:06] had all kind of doctors
[1:41:09] to to see her because of this eating
[1:41:12] disorder
[1:41:13] and and she couldn't eat certain things
[1:41:16] and couldn't eat certain things and and
[1:41:18] she would try to eat she would try and
[1:41:19] she would try and she would get sick and
[1:41:22] and we wanted our best for the baby but
[1:41:25] the other night
[1:41:26] as she was coming into that prayer line
[1:41:29] at the tent as they were pulling me out
[1:41:31] god stopped us
[1:41:33] and in a moment
[1:41:35] [Applause]
[1:41:37] in a moment god healed her
[1:41:52] are you with me
[1:41:55] let me just say sometimes we're sitting
[1:41:57] and standing and brother brahma would
[1:41:59] say these words in two worlds at the
[1:42:01] same time
[1:42:04] if we could only be conscious
[1:42:06] of what is going on around us
[1:42:11] we don't have a day off with god
[1:42:14] [Music]
[1:42:16] i heard last night doomed devils are on
[1:42:19] the run
[1:42:21] are you with me they've come to their
[1:42:23] end
[1:42:25] they realized they throwed everything at
[1:42:27] the bride of jesus christ and there's
[1:42:29] nothing
[1:42:31] there's nothing that has deterred her
[1:42:34] faith
[1:42:34] [Applause]
[1:42:39] brother brown would tell us
[1:42:46] two years before
[1:42:48] of a certain animal that he's going to
[1:42:50] kill caribou
[1:42:52] 42-inch horns actually he wouldn't know
[1:42:54] it would be a caribou he just knew it
[1:42:56] was a certain animal had a certain color
[1:42:58] but the horns were a certain way and be
[1:43:00] exactly 42 inches
[1:43:03] now that's incredible
[1:43:04] but that's only half
[1:43:07] he and the guide would be walking down
[1:43:09] off of the mountain
[1:43:11] and they would kill a silver tipped
[1:43:12] grizzly bear one shot with too small a
[1:43:16] gun
[1:43:19] now
[1:43:21] i've heard brother briscoe tell it i
[1:43:22] heard brother branham tell it
[1:43:27] even the god had never seen that kind of
[1:43:29] an animal
[1:43:31] and he had definitely never seen a
[1:43:33] silver tipped grizzly bear the area was
[1:43:35] new to him but he had never seen that
[1:43:37] kind of a grizzly bear there
[1:43:39] and so
[1:43:40] they're there
[1:43:43] and they're glass in the area and there
[1:43:44] have been days now and there there they
[1:43:47] are
[1:43:48] there is that caribou
[1:43:52] and brother branham said that we must go
[1:43:54] this way
[1:43:56] we must go this way
[1:43:57] to get to him
[1:43:59] and the god told him said we can't go
[1:44:01] that way we'll cause a rock slide and he
[1:44:03] said well that's what the angel said for
[1:44:05] us to do he said let's go
[1:44:12] are you with me
[1:44:15] the caribou's shot
[1:44:17] brother branham
[1:44:18] is standing there reeling in the vision
[1:44:21] he's experiencing the fulfillment
[1:44:24] of it taking place
[1:44:26] are you catching what i'm doing now
[1:44:28] he's experiencing it don't take long
[1:44:31] it's just minutes
[1:44:33] two years
[1:44:34] now it's just minutes happening
[1:44:38] brother biscuit standing there in a
[1:44:39] green checkered shirt he had told his
[1:44:42] wife to throw it away but she ironed it
[1:44:43] put it back in
[1:44:45] he fell in the mud had to put it back on
[1:44:50] because it had to fulfill the vision he
[1:44:52] stood here in this pulpit and told us
[1:44:54] that
[1:44:57] listen we as ministers we don't have any
[1:45:00] agenda to lie to you
[1:45:03] we don't have any agenda to embellish
[1:45:05] the story
[1:45:07] let me just say god don't need to be
[1:45:09] propped up
[1:45:10] [Applause]
[1:45:13] his word is true he's
[1:45:15] he's incredibly accurate
[1:45:18] [Applause]
[1:45:32] now i as a minister realize you've heard
[1:45:34] these stories
[1:45:35] a hundred times
[1:45:37] but you don't realize what i'm going to
[1:45:39] do with that
[1:45:42] now they're walking back down off of the
[1:45:44] mountain pictures no doubt taken
[1:45:46] measured exactly 42 inches brother
[1:45:49] biscuit actually says i hinged my entire
[1:45:53] faith
[1:45:55] and that thing being exactly 42 inches
[1:46:00] if it had been a quarter one way or the
[1:46:02] other there'd have been room for error
[1:46:05] but it was exactly 42 inches
[1:46:09] brother branham
[1:46:11] his guide are walking back bud is
[1:46:13] walking down off of the hill
[1:46:15] now they're walking
[1:46:17] but the second part now is coming
[1:46:21] and bud begins to explain to him
[1:46:26] brother branham i can see for miles
[1:46:30] and i can't see
[1:46:32] a grizzly bear
[1:46:34] a bear
[1:46:36] anywhere
[1:46:40] brother branham asked him about
[1:46:43] even his brother
[1:46:46] you know they begin to talk
[1:46:48] and he says but or
[1:46:51] you doubting the vision
[1:46:55] now here's where i want to go with this
[1:46:58] i i'm explaining to you part two
[1:47:03] of this incredible vision
[1:47:05] listen there's not a guide anywhere in
[1:47:08] the world
[1:47:10] that you describe to him i want to kill
[1:47:14] i want to kill a a
[1:47:17] white-tailed deer
[1:47:19] and it to be 208 score
[1:47:25] may it be so
[1:47:31] and may jason
[1:47:32] mount that deer
[1:47:41] and then and then when we get done with
[1:47:43] that
[1:47:45] we're going to kill an elk
[1:47:48] on a way back down off of the rich
[1:47:51] there's not a god in the world wants to
[1:47:53] sign up for that
[1:47:54] amen
[1:47:58] that's a dream
[1:48:00] that's more than even hollywood can
[1:48:02] conjure but that's not that's not even
[1:48:05] thinking about we got a god
[1:48:11] i i want to just stop here for a moment
[1:48:14] we've had the message delivered to us
[1:48:19] part 1 said behold i send you elijah the
[1:48:22] prophet
[1:48:25] before the great and the dreadful day of
[1:48:27] the lord
[1:48:30] the message came he delivered you don't
[1:48:32] have to add nothing to it
[1:48:35] we don't need another great man to come
[1:48:36] on the scene we don't need another
[1:48:39] popularity we don't need a kingdom
[1:48:41] builder the message is delivered
[1:49:00] now the devil whispers in your ear
[1:49:02] especially when there's time
[1:49:05] [Applause]
[1:49:07] as it stretches out over decades and it
[1:49:10] stretches out but god made a promise
[1:49:14] he's never failed on a promise
[1:49:18] check him out he's never failed
[1:49:20] [Applause]
[1:49:26] well brother ron i i need vindication
[1:49:28] well what are you going to vindicate it
[1:49:30] by
[1:49:31] some silly college education
[1:49:34] idiot
[1:49:47] oh but i got a better idea
[1:49:49] our nation can't figure out who to have
[1:49:51] as a president
[1:49:58] we've come to the end
[1:50:04] i'm sorry
[1:50:06] my insurance agent told me today i need
[1:50:07] to be careful in the pulpit well i'm
[1:50:09] gonna do my best
[1:50:11] it's a no-brainer we need somebody to
[1:50:13] garner school
[1:50:17] it's a no-brainer
[1:50:20] it's a no-brainer we don't need to kill
[1:50:22] our unborn babies it's a no-brainer
[1:50:38] and i just want to say this you god sent
[1:50:40] you a prophet
[1:50:43] he sent you a prophet he's your prophet
[1:50:46] whether you believe him or you don't
[1:50:49] believe it
[1:50:51] he was a prophet that gets you in the
[1:50:53] rapture or send you into the tribulation
[1:50:56] period
[1:50:57] but he's still a prophet
[1:51:15] well brother ron he since he said some
[1:51:17] things that
[1:51:18] i didn't i didn't agree with
[1:51:22] okay
[1:51:24] okay
[1:51:29] let's go to our prayer line let's let's
[1:51:30] let's go to uh private prayer
[1:51:34] there's a woman that's been brother
[1:51:35] branham's friend
[1:51:37] for decades
[1:51:40] and she's got a nervous condition
[1:51:43] and brother brandon says one day one day
[1:51:45] when the angels here
[1:51:47] just have her to come in and we'll pray
[1:51:48] with her
[1:51:52] she walks in
[1:51:54] they bring her in and set her down
[1:51:56] brother random says i
[1:52:00] i see you when your husband was away at
[1:52:03] war
[1:52:06] and you were in a certain certain car
[1:52:08] and you just about get hit by a train
[1:52:11] and you was with another man
[1:52:18] i see that
[1:52:22] she could have got mad
[1:52:26] she could have stomped out
[1:52:27] but now she realizes
[1:52:30] decades
[1:52:32] didn't cover up her sin
[1:52:37] and she's sitting there i can't confess
[1:52:39] that to my husband now her husband
[1:52:41] wasn't in the room
[1:52:43] i can't confess that to my husband
[1:52:47] it would destroy our marriage
[1:52:49] and brother and says
[1:52:50] bring your husband here
[1:52:52] he's got the same problem
[1:53:01] now listen that wasn't just in prayer
[1:53:04] but that was in preaching
[1:53:07] when brother branham is preaching is
[1:53:09] your life worthy of the gospel and it
[1:53:11] goes through the characteristics of a
[1:53:13] christian life
[1:53:14] there will be spots in there that you go
[1:53:17] that's dumb
[1:53:19] that stunk
[1:53:20] brother roger you had a statement that
[1:53:22] homer was getting on your toes
[1:53:24] and you would pull your shoes up under
[1:53:26] he said still stomp my feet
[1:53:29] you could have got mad
[1:53:31] and you and brother homer were best of
[1:53:33] friends
[1:53:36] but the zeal of this age is to repent
[1:53:41] somehow we want the holy ghost i sat
[1:53:43] with gabriel this morning at breakfast
[1:53:45] and we have breakfast every sunday
[1:53:47] morning it's kind of a thing that we do
[1:53:49] thank you sarah
[1:53:50] it's a thing that we do we have
[1:53:52] breakfast every sunday morning together
[1:53:54] and i was sitting there and explaining
[1:53:55] to him like a jelly jar
[1:53:58] now that jelly jar can't be sealed until
[1:54:02] all the impurities are out of it
[1:54:05] so you can wash the jar you get all the
[1:54:07] impurities out you
[1:54:09] you cook the jelly you get it exactly
[1:54:12] ready everything is just right then you
[1:54:14] put a cap on it
[1:54:16] if the impurities are out of it and you
[1:54:19] cook it just right it will seal and you
[1:54:22] can set it on a jar forever
[1:54:25] or a long time
[1:54:27] understand that
[1:54:29] but if there's rottenness on the inside
[1:54:31] of it
[1:54:34] if there's rottenness on the inside of
[1:54:37] it when the repentance is preached that
[1:54:40] thing will blow up
[1:54:45] you can desire to have the holy ghost
[1:54:47] for a hundred years but if you're not
[1:54:49] right
[1:54:50] somebody ought to be helping me right
[1:54:52] now
[1:54:52] [Applause]
[1:54:58] it's daily in your prayer life
[1:55:04] well i i don't have any brother branham
[1:55:06] said pray
[1:55:08] to repent of your unbelief
[1:55:11] that's one of the biggest things
[1:55:14] we're expecting rapture where he changes
[1:55:16] her body more than just cleanses us of
[1:55:19] cancer
[1:55:21] he's going to turn me back to a
[1:55:22] red-headed boy again
[1:55:26] where i can run like a deer
[1:55:33] i tell some of you kids that's
[1:55:34] interested in athletics when i was a boy
[1:55:38] i was the fastest boy in our class
[1:55:43] i weighed 118 pounds i could fly
[1:55:47] i was strong because we put up hay all
[1:55:50] of our life
[1:55:51] since a little boy put up thousands of
[1:55:54] bales of hay every year
[1:55:56] worked hard
[1:55:58] lift weights
[1:55:59] well i could lift about 350 pounds for a
[1:56:02] bench press
[1:56:03] then i set a record six
[1:56:05] [Applause]
[1:56:11] it's for you brother denny
[1:56:16] i never told my boys those things
[1:56:19] homer told me he said don't tell your
[1:56:20] boys those things
[1:56:22] he told them a lot of things but he told
[1:56:24] me don't tell them none of that
[1:56:32] we were buying a bull one day
[1:56:36] we're looking across at a black angus
[1:56:38] bull weighing about 700 pounds
[1:56:41] the guy that was we were buying it from
[1:56:45] knew me
[1:56:46] in another life
[1:56:49] and he started telling these two guys
[1:56:51] back here not you william but matt and
[1:56:54] andrew he started telling them about a
[1:56:57] a guy that came into the grocery store
[1:56:59] where we worked and said he'd been beat
[1:57:01] up by a gang
[1:57:03] said he was he was beat up and said
[1:57:05] couldn't come to work for a week he'd
[1:57:08] been beat up by a gang he said i found
[1:57:10] out it was your daddy
[1:57:12] that did that
[1:57:17] you know that guy
[1:57:19] was you there
[1:57:24] i told him i said craig don't tell these
[1:57:25] boys that kind of stuff they've never
[1:57:27] heard it
[1:57:31] you see i'm not proud of those things
[1:57:33] and i didn't tell you that i would be
[1:57:34] proud of that
[1:57:35] and i'm not proud of that but i am proud
[1:57:38] that since god changed my life
[1:57:42] i have grinned while i've defeated a lot
[1:57:44] of devils in the name of the lord jesus
[1:57:47] christ
[1:57:57] now i'm saying that i'm not going to get
[1:57:58] done but i'm saying this
[1:58:02] i experienced
[1:58:04] what this message is
[1:58:08] i grew up
[1:58:10] and i i had an upper hand on many of you
[1:58:13] i grew up listening to tapes
[1:58:16] that was in our home
[1:58:18] you can't substitute that
[1:58:21] hearing the prophet's voice
[1:58:23] listening to the word
[1:58:25] i grew up in that kind of an atmosphere
[1:58:29] and i'm tying some things together one
[1:58:31] of the worst fights i was ever in
[1:58:34] was when a guy told me that brother
[1:58:36] branham wasn't a prophet
[1:58:38] in a bar room
[1:58:41] that was a really
[1:58:43] bad thing
[1:58:44] to do
[1:58:47] amen
[1:58:49] it was a bad thing
[1:58:51] to tell me that brother branham wasn't a
[1:58:53] prophet because i was convinced
[1:58:56] you know it's even still a bad thing
[1:59:01] to do to this 60 year old guy
[1:59:03] to tell me that brother brandon wasn't a
[1:59:05] prophet
[1:59:08] i'm not going to whip you physically
[1:59:10] but i'm going to tell you where your
[1:59:12] choices will take you
[1:59:14] and it ain't going to be good
[1:59:20] you'll start falling like you've never
[1:59:22] felt before in your life
[1:59:24] sin will take you somewhere
[1:59:28] and before long this won't work for you
[1:59:30] you're gonna have to have another one
[1:59:33] and there's no church will fit you
[1:59:35] before long husbands and wives are gone
[1:59:37] and children are gone
[1:59:40] don't even know their own genders
[1:59:41] anymore
[1:59:51] but when i got a change
[1:59:54] i realized that i had to so repent
[1:59:58] and keep repenting
[2:00:00] and keep repenting
[2:00:02] and keep repenting
[2:00:05] because i needed to keep my spirit clean
[2:00:09] now i want to give you just a little bit
[2:00:10] right now in your enoch walk
[2:00:13] in laodicea satan can't get to your soul
[2:00:19] because that's sealed for eternity
[2:00:21] but he can get to your flesh
[2:00:26] how many ever feel that temper rise up
[2:00:28] just a little bit they ain't done that
[2:00:30] in 10 years and all of a sudden
[2:00:32] boom somebody cut you off at a red light
[2:00:37] boom
[2:00:41] yep i'm preaching to the right group
[2:00:52] then if you can't work on your flesh
[2:00:53] you'll go right to your spirit
[2:00:57] in their lay's conscience and memory
[2:01:00] affections
[2:01:02] your feelings lay on the inside of all
[2:01:05] of that and begin to work backwards and
[2:01:07] forwards with your flesh
[2:01:09] and if you're not careful
[2:01:13] he'll bring up tin can alley
[2:01:18] and you'll be texting some old
[2:01:20] girlfriend oh come on somebody help me
[2:01:22] preach
[2:01:23] you got no business doing that
[2:01:29] texting some old guy out there that you
[2:01:31] used to drink and smoke and cheating lie
[2:01:34] with let me just say this to you
[2:01:36] let them grow
[2:01:40] we're not heading in the same direction
[2:01:51] brother ron
[2:01:52] but i keep hearing these words but the
[2:01:54] rapture keeps getting further and
[2:01:56] further and further away
[2:01:59] are you doubting the vision
[2:02:06] are you doubting the vision
[2:02:11] when you're actually walking in it
[2:02:15] did you catch those last words when
[2:02:18] you're actually
[2:02:20] walking in it
[2:02:22] that little girl the armor and company
[2:02:23] girl how do you remember that story
[2:02:27] she fixed breakfast
[2:02:29] last time
[2:02:33] made beds
[2:02:34] last time
[2:02:36] took her apron off last time one of
[2:02:39] these mornings
[2:02:42] notice when god told them to with the
[2:02:44] token put your shoes on be ready
[2:02:47] you ain't gonna have time to clean your
[2:02:49] closets out to get your shoes just right
[2:02:51] you got to be ready
[2:02:53] in such an hour as you think not
[2:02:58] brother ron i got all the time in the
[2:02:59] world
[2:03:03] last week putin told us how quick he
[2:03:05] could destroy america four bombs
[2:03:08] he could do it in less than 30 minutes
[2:03:14] he's just reiterating what brother
[2:03:16] branham said
[2:03:17] long time ago
[2:03:20] he couldn't do what he's doing except
[2:03:22] for a prophet
[2:03:27] come on church
[2:03:28] you don't need some prognosticator to
[2:03:30] tell you all of those things
[2:03:32] you definitely don't need a talking head
[2:03:34] on fox news to tell you all those things
[2:03:37] or cnn with their filter you had a
[2:03:40] profit
[2:03:41] [Applause]
[2:03:47] i don't have the answer of how it all
[2:03:49] works out
[2:03:52] we're already driving cars that are
[2:03:54] smarter than even brother branham
[2:03:56] explained
[2:03:59] we've already had a woman
[2:04:02] in an office with purple dress
[2:04:05] los angeles is shook and shook and shook
[2:04:08] sin is everywhere
[2:04:11] it's everywhere the world has fell apart
[2:04:14] rush is doing what they're doing they're
[2:04:16] preparing they're they're ranking it
[2:04:17] they're they're shaking the world
[2:04:23] they're shaking the world
[2:04:29] don't let ten dollar gas
[2:04:34] blur your vision
[2:04:41] i don't know about you but i get
[2:04:43] aggravated at five dollar gas
[2:04:49] but our canadian friends are paying ten
[2:04:50] dollars
[2:04:52] ten dollars
[2:04:55] their money
[2:05:03] god has an agenda
[2:05:07] it's kind of like putting your shoes on
[2:05:10] and i don't want to come to some sort of
[2:05:12] a close here
[2:05:13] be alright if i say this to a couple
[2:05:15] weeks but
[2:05:18] one night brother joe forney
[2:05:21] was going to the camp meeting
[2:05:26] and he was going to the service that
[2:05:27] night and
[2:05:29] and i would be speaking
[2:05:31] and he said i walked into my
[2:05:33] my closet
[2:05:35] and he said the voice spoke to him said
[2:05:38] put on a suit
[2:05:40] you're going
[2:05:42] you're going to be praying in the prayer
[2:05:43] line with brother ron
[2:05:49] well i preached that evening
[2:05:52] and it come to time to pray for those
[2:05:55] that were needing prayer and it was just
[2:05:57] an immediate prayer line that went all
[2:05:58] the way up some of you were there and i
[2:06:01] motioned back and there was probably 40
[2:06:03] preachers sitting in that corner
[2:06:07] and i just motioned like that
[2:06:09] and jewel immediately jumped out of his
[2:06:11] seat
[2:06:14] he said god didn't tell the rest of them
[2:06:15] he told me
[2:06:18] now i'm going to use that
[2:06:20] he didn't tell the rest of them he told
[2:06:22] me to go there and to put on the suit
[2:06:25] he didn't tell the whole world this
[2:06:27] message
[2:06:33] he told me
[2:06:36] and i'm one of them
[2:06:46] wow
[2:07:02] you know
[2:07:02] i'm done you can you can stand
[2:07:05] how do you explain an experience
[2:07:08] how do you explain it
[2:07:09] what was it like to get burned by fire
[2:07:11] it was hot
[2:07:14] what was it like to fall off of a roof
[2:07:18] i didn't feel an angel
[2:07:20] it just hurt
[2:07:22] what is it like to fight cancer it's
[2:07:24] kind of like having the flu every day
[2:07:29] but in all of those cases jesus is with
[2:07:31] you
[2:07:38] we stepped out of a restaurant
[2:07:41] and i looked down at the end of the
[2:07:43] street
[2:07:47] and there stood
[2:07:49] andrew
[2:07:51] with tom ray
[2:07:58] and in just a few seconds
[2:08:01] andrew
[2:08:02] was a different guy
[2:08:07] from that experience
[2:08:11] you get a song leader like you got
[2:08:15] and a preacher like you god
[2:08:18] and he feeds it he's a good student of
[2:08:20] the message
[2:08:22] sister ruth you know that
[2:08:24] you feed from his ministry
[2:08:27] and you feed from that experience but
[2:08:29] it's not just his experience
[2:08:32] but now you want yours
[2:08:36] it's not just enough for him to have it
[2:08:39] but katie's got to get it
[2:08:41] their children's got to get it
[2:08:46] i'll never forget
[2:08:48] when i baptize you brother jordan and
[2:08:51] sister kirsten
[2:08:52] in their old order clothes
[2:08:56] to me it was one of the greatest
[2:08:58] experiences of my life because it was
[2:09:00] showing
[2:09:01] one thing as dying and a new life is
[2:09:04] coming
[2:09:08] and i i looked at him last night and he
[2:09:10] was on his feet
[2:09:13] and he was dressed to the nines
[2:09:17] he wasn't in old order last night
[2:09:23] daddy's at home
[2:09:29] what happened
[2:09:31] he experienced something
[2:09:35] more than church
[2:09:38] more than a pew
[2:09:40] more than tapes and books
[2:09:44] but this message i heard it
[2:09:47] it works
[2:10:01] hallelujah
[2:10:07] you'll be drinking coffee
[2:10:09] maybe hot tea
[2:10:12] and you'll feel a little wave come by

[2:10:19] maybe you'll look out the door
