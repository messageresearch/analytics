[5:16] the book of Genesis chapter 4 verse 3
[5:24] Genesis 4 and verse 3
[5:37] tonight I'd like to speak to you on a
[5:40] thought and it's been on my heart this
[5:42] week on the power the power of sacrifice
[5:46] the power of sacrifice in Genesis
[5:50] chapter 4 and verse 3 if you don't know
[5:53] where the book of Genesis is it's in the
[5:57] very beginning and then will be turning
[6:00] over to Isaiah 53 almost directly in the
[6:04] middle of the book they're very familiar
[6:06] scriptures to us this evening and I'll
[6:10] just trust that you'll hop right in the
[6:11] the the channela fault this evening and
[6:15] maybe we can get your minds off the
[6:17] things of Laodicea and the things of the
[6:20] world this evening and may we just just
[6:22] be able to just bask in his presence
[6:24] this evening Genesis 4 and 3 and in the
[6:28] process of time it came to pass that
[6:30] Cain brought of the fruit of the ground
[6:33] an offering unto the Lord in Abel he
[6:37] also brought of the firstlings of his
[6:40] flock and of the fat thereof and the
[6:43] Lord had respect unto Abel and to his
[6:46] offering but unto Cain and to his
[6:49] offering he had not respect and Cain was
[6:53] very wroth and his countenance failed
[6:55] and the Lord said unto Cain why art thou
[6:58] wroth and why is thy countenance fallen
[7:01] if thou doest well shalt thou not be
[7:05] accepted and if thou doest not well sin
[7:09] life at the door and under these shall
[7:12] be his desire and thou shalt roll over
[7:15] him Isaiah 53 and verse 1 the Bible says
[7:24] here who has believed our report and to
[7:28] whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for
[7:32] he shall grow up before him as a tender
[7:34] plant as they root out of dry ground
[7:38] he hath no form nor comeliness and when
[7:41] we shall see him there is no beauty that
[7:45] we should desire him
[7:47] he is despised and rejected of men a man
[7:50] of sorrows and acquainted with grief and
[7:53] we hid as it were our faces from him he
[7:57] was despised and we esteemed him not
[8:00] surely he has borne our griefs and
[8:03] carried our sorrows yet we did esteem
[8:06] him stricken smitten of God and
[8:08] afflicted but he was wounded for our
[8:12] transgressions he was bruised for our
[8:16] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[8:19] was upon him and with His stripes we are
[8:23] healed may God bless his reading of the
[8:26] word this evening you may be seated in
[8:28] the presence of the Lord said would like
[8:40] to speak to you on this thought on the
[8:42] power the power of sacrifice there was
[8:47] once a young man that that came to w/e
[8:51] Gladstone when he was a prime minister
[8:54] of England and this young man came to
[8:58] mr. Gladstone and said mr. Gladstone I
[9:01] would appreciate your giving me a few
[9:03] minutes in which I might lay before you
[9:06] my plans for the future he says I would
[9:09] like to study law yes said the great
[9:11] statesman and what then he said then sir
[9:15] I would like to gain entrance to the bar
[9:17] of England yes young man and and what
[9:20] then he said then sir I hope to have a
[9:23] place in Parliament in the House of
[9:25] Lords and he said yes young man what
[9:28] then pressed Gladstone he said then I
[9:31] hope to do great things for Britain he
[9:33] said yes young man and what then then
[9:36] sir I hope to retire and take life easy
[9:38] yes young man and and what then he
[9:42] tenaciously asked well then mr.
[9:44] Gladstone I suppose I will die yes young
[9:47] man and what then the young man
[9:49] hesitated and then said I never thought
[9:51] any further than that sir looking at the
[9:54] young man sternly and steadily Gladstone
[9:57] said young man
[9:58] you are a fool go home and think life
[10:01] through here is is depicted a young man
[10:05] that came to a great statesman that had
[10:09] prepped in his life and in his thinking
[10:11] how that everything was going to take
[10:13] place and transpire in his future and no
[10:16] doubt in his mind he had set apart
[10:18] different energies and sacrifices that
[10:21] he would make for worldly gain but he
[10:23] had never went so far as to the think of
[10:26] the sacrifices that he would make
[10:29] towards the prince of life he never gave
[10:32] thought he gave thought to all the
[10:34] worldly things and he gave thought to
[10:35] all the things that would would help him
[10:38] gain entrance into a greater stature of
[10:40] a human being in the natural realm but
[10:43] he had not gained gave any interest and
[10:46] he not gave any thought to the afterlife
[10:48] and if you have not gave any thought to
[10:51] your afterlife and where you're going to
[10:53] spend eternity
[10:54] I trust you make those thoughts this
[10:56] evening where where you will decide and
[10:59] and you know as we think on this thought
[11:02] on the power of sacrifice that that you
[11:04] find today that sacrifice is so little
[11:07] talked about anymore and and really
[11:09] sacrifice is hardly seen anymore amongst
[11:11] people because what sacrifice is the
[11:14] sacrifice is serving is serving others
[11:17] and and being a Christian is to is spend
[11:20] in a life of service that's what in life
[11:22] of a Christian is and and and you know I
[11:25] found in life that a lot of people want
[11:27] to be served but they don't want to
[11:28] serve others they want to spend their
[11:31] time sit back and lay back in a lazy boy
[11:34] and let somebody make them happy in life
[11:36] but they don't want to they don't want
[11:37] to get up and do anything they want
[11:39] their children to get up and and pay the
[11:41] bills for more or maybe maybe they maybe
[11:44] it's a child another stance and maybe
[11:46] they get a getting a little bit of a I
[11:48] hit about them and think well my parents
[11:50] should provide for everything for me
[11:52] they're not there to serve anymore but I
[11:54] remember times I remember times that
[11:57] that you know everybody everybody now
[11:59] wants everything just right in the
[12:01] minute or right in the moment but you
[12:04] know one time there was somebody in our
[12:06] family I talked
[12:07] Grandaddy and said hey you know
[12:08] something said you you and all of your
[12:11] business dealings and things you should
[12:12] have created a a a green bean picker and
[12:16] a green bean breaker he said I did he
[12:18] said I birthed all of this line of
[12:20] children right here in grandchildren he
[12:22] said he said that's what you are but I
[12:24] you know there's a lot of people that
[12:26] just want to put the dishes in the
[12:27] dishwasher and they don't want to have
[12:29] to sacrifice their time of just sitting
[12:32] down but I remember times as was young
[12:34] people that that we would sit down and
[12:36] we would sacrifice and we were the
[12:38] dishwasher back then but a lot of people
[12:40] don't understand sacrifice the way that
[12:43] that they things were back when and
[12:46] that's not been too long ago but I find
[12:48] sometimes that there's young people
[12:50] amongst us that don't understand how our
[12:53] life truly was or how how lie how great
[12:56] we have it in this life and you know
[12:58] there's very little bit of Tom say that
[13:00] is spent in sacrifice or spent serving
[13:03] God or they they people you find it
[13:06] today that people want an experience
[13:07] right now but yet they don't were to
[13:09] sacrifice the time I'm truly having a
[13:12] born-again baptism of the Holy Ghost but
[13:16] if you search out your life and look at
[13:18] everything that you do you will find
[13:20] that everything that you do is involved
[13:23] in a sacrifice and you may not make it
[13:25] to make it be that way but you know that
[13:27] you sacrifice time for your family
[13:29] instead of coming to the house of God
[13:31] sometimes or your sacrifice doing this
[13:34] or enjoyments and times and instead of
[13:36] to having time spent with God and there
[13:39] there's no power in a sacrifice of
[13:41] spending time on in in enchantments and
[13:44] witchdoctors and things like that but
[13:46] there is power in the sacrifice of the
[13:49] Lamb of God but everything that we do is
[13:53] spend in sacrifice we sacrifice time for
[13:56] our family and I believe that we should
[13:58] have time for our family but I believe
[14:00] that God deserves first place I believe
[14:03] that letter that there's people that
[14:05] spend time for their work but they don't
[14:07] spend time in the Bible you see you a
[14:12] sacrifice sacrifice it is the act of
[14:17] slaughtering an animal
[14:19] for an offering to God or it means to
[14:21] give up something valued for the sake of
[14:24] something else more important maybe I'll
[14:27] put it in terminology where some of the
[14:29] young people get it or some of the young
[14:31] boys that play baseball get it but there
[14:33] is such thing as a sacrifice bunt and
[14:36] what they're doing there as they're
[14:38] trying to advance a runner to the next
[14:40] position and though they may not get on
[14:42] base they'll maybe get out but yet they
[14:44] are pushing they are advancing the
[14:47] runner forward and you know I've found
[14:49] sometimes that young people or even
[14:53] sometimes so-called Christians of today
[14:55] they don't want to sacrifice their own
[14:57] time just just to move somebody else
[15:00] forward what is life's worth then if
[15:03] we're not here to help others if we're
[15:05] only here for ourselves then we are
[15:08] becoming a Laodicea church member but
[15:12] the whole purpose in life is to see
[15:14] somebody else but I mean my candle got
[15:17] lit but I want to see somebody else have
[15:20] the same lighting of the candle in their
[15:23] life you see sacrifice is something that
[15:27] you're willing to give up for something
[15:29] that you have deemed more valuable and
[15:32] if you deem the the life that you spend
[15:35] out in the world or you spend your
[15:37] energies out in the world and I want to
[15:39] say this to you that if it costs you
[15:41] your soul it's too expensive you may buy
[15:46] a lot of things in life and you may
[15:47] purchase a lot of things and sacrifice
[15:49] monies to buy different things but if it
[15:52] costs you your soul it's way too
[15:53] expensive if it costs you your peace of
[15:56] mind it's way too expensive and because
[15:59] your faith if it cost you if it cost
[16:01] your long suffering I want you to know
[16:03] it's way too expensive
[16:06] and I pray that you bear with me just
[16:08] for a moment here but the now sacrifice
[16:11] it's the offering of sacrifices the
[16:16] offering of a sacrifice as it is to be
[16:19] regarded as a divine institution it did
[16:22] not originate with man but God himself
[16:25] appointed appointed sacrifice as the
[16:28] mode in which this which was acceptable
[16:31] was to be offered to him by the guilty
[16:34] man then language and the idea of
[16:37] sacrifice is throughout the whole entire
[16:39] Bible it pervades the whole Bible of
[16:42] offering and sacrifices we see that
[16:45] throughout the Bible that there were
[16:47] sacrifices made and if you look back at
[16:50] the very beginning of the book you will
[16:52] see the fall of humanity and after the
[16:56] sinning there stood there stood Adam and
[16:59] Eve in the presence of God and God said
[17:01] depart out of my presence and he said I
[17:05] can see the brother's head I can see
[17:07] them going he said I can see evils to
[17:10] see see her later little head over on
[17:12] Adams shoulder and saying Adam it's my
[17:15] fault I was the one who did it but Adams
[17:18] so loved his wife that he wasn't
[17:20] deceived but he loved her so well that
[17:23] he walked out with her which was a
[17:26] perfect type of Jesus Christ Oh
[17:29] hallelujah who knows no sin but came to
[17:33] the world and taken the sin of his wife
[17:35] the church and walked to death with her
[17:39] hallelujah there they go there there
[17:42] there's all the great Jehovah looking at
[17:45] them there goes his son there goes his
[17:47] daughter I hear something going like
[17:50] this what is it it's the clapping a
[17:52] slapping sound it's the bloody sheepskin
[17:56] beating against Adams legs and he said
[17:59] wait a minute I will put enmity between
[18:02] the woman's seed and the serpent seed
[18:05] what was he promising he was promising a
[18:08] promised redeemer that would come and
[18:11] take away the sin of the world he was
[18:15] speaking of a sacrifice that was to come
[18:18] you go back to the very beginning and
[18:21] you'll find that God laid down the
[18:24] program right in the Garden of Eden that
[18:26] there was to be a sacrifice you see but
[18:30] man tried to make his own religion he
[18:32] made himself a fig leaf and he tried to
[18:35] cover himself but you know there was no
[18:39] power in those fig leaves because God
[18:41] seen right through those fig leaves
[18:44] and you can try to cover up your seeing
[18:46] it you can try to cover up your mistakes
[18:49] but God is looking right through that
[18:51] covering you see there's only one thing
[18:55] that will cover you from your sin and
[18:58] I'm not just talking about a covering
[18:59] I'm talking about a remitting of sins
[19:01] but the Bible said that without the
[19:04] shedding of blood there is no remission
[19:06] of sins but where there is the shedding
[19:10] of blood there is remission of sins it
[19:15] was the blood that brought them back
[19:17] into fellowship that was power in the
[19:20] sacrifice that allowed God to commune
[19:23] with his children again whoo hallelujah
[19:27] there was no power in the fig leaves
[19:30] there's no power in denominational ideas
[19:33] or creeds and dogmas that won't cover
[19:36] you but there's only one thing that will
[19:39] cover you from your sin that'll totally
[19:42] annihilate your sin and that's this
[19:45] blood and I want to say to you that
[19:49] there's power in this blood there's
[19:51] wonder-working power in the blood of
[19:54] Jesus Christ God hates a powerless
[19:57] religion what Adam had was a powerless
[20:00] religion he couldn't do anything for him
[20:02] he couldn't bring him back into
[20:04] communion but you know where the blood
[20:08] is there is power at you see according
[20:13] to God's command as we look at the
[20:16] animal sacrifice the animal that
[20:19] sacrifice had to be physically perfect
[20:21] in age and condition there could be no
[20:25] blemish on this animal hallelujah the
[20:29] perfection of this animal perfection was
[20:32] then presented to God you see this was
[20:35] symbolic for the people and to present
[20:38] themselves perfect before God by
[20:41] presenting the perfect one in their
[20:43] place you know Jesus told us to be the e
[20:46] therefore perfect as her father in
[20:48] heaven is perfect but you know there's
[20:50] nothing in your own works that can make
[20:52] you perfect there's nothing that you can
[20:55] do to make yourself more
[20:57] there's nothing that would make you be a
[20:59] full owner in your own righteousness
[21:02] their filthy arrives but I want you to
[21:05] know in turn the blood of Jesus Christ
[21:07] takes her sin and makes it righteous he
[21:12] makes you holy he makes you pour pure
[21:14] and makes you just and after the animal
[21:20] is selected and presented at the altar
[21:22] the first act was laying on hands by the
[21:24] person that was presenting the offer
[21:28] here he was he would take the lamb or he
[21:31] would take the animal and he would bring
[21:32] him up to the high priest or however the
[21:35] order was how he would bring him up and
[21:38] he would present him there because there
[21:41] was an innocent lamb that was going to
[21:44] give his life for the guilty party here
[21:49] the worshipper comes up and he brings he
[21:52] brings up the sacrifice and this
[21:55] sacrifice would allow him to commune
[21:58] with God and when the guilty person
[22:01] would bring up that animal he would come
[22:04] and ask the priest would yes he
[22:07] would cut the the the the animal's
[22:10] throat when he would slit his throat he
[22:12] would lay his hand upon that animal and
[22:16] as the innocent animals life was going
[22:19] out this was symbolic of that in what we
[22:23] do now we lay our hands upon the
[22:26] sacrifice and it makes us pure it makes
[22:30] us identified with our sacrifice are you
[22:35] with me tonight
[22:35] this was symbolically pointing to the
[22:39] Savior who would do this for the
[22:41] believers in which they could not do for
[22:43] themselves he would take upon himself
[22:46] the sin and guilt and blame and shame
[22:51] and all of the pain and accomplish
[22:53] redemption for his people hallelujah
[23:00] hallelujah I know there's a lot of
[23:01] people that like to claim the blood of
[23:04] Jesus Christ they like to claim that
[23:07] their Christian
[23:08] but Christ came to save his people come
[23:12] on somebody the blood was shed but it is
[23:16] for those who'd swear God's people there
[23:19] is so much power that it can cleanse a
[23:22] universe well you look over in the
[23:30] festival of the Day of Atonement there
[23:33] was two goats that depicted this
[23:35] redemptive act and one goat there was
[23:38] two goats that depicted it but one goal
[23:41] he dieded Steff symbolizing how the
[23:44] ultimate sacrifice in the future would
[23:47] pay the penalty for the believer sins
[23:49] its blood was applied to the mercy seat
[23:53] in the Holies of Holies when the high
[23:55] priests would walk in there and sprinkle
[23:57] the blood upon the mercy seat Oh
[24:00] hallelujah
[24:02] symbolizing hell the great sacrifice
[24:05] would cover the people's sins bringing
[24:08] them into God's presence and make full
[24:11] restoration to God hallelujah and then
[24:16] to the head of the second goat the
[24:18] priest symbolically transferred the sin
[24:23] of God's people upon the second goat
[24:27] hallelujah then this goat was known as
[24:31] the scapegoat was sent into the
[24:33] wilderness to symbolize the removal but
[24:36] the people sin if you go over in the
[24:38] Book of Leviticus 16 you'll see all of
[24:40] these things how that they transpire and
[24:44] how that a strong man would take that
[24:46] scapegoat a man that was fit to do the
[24:49] job would walk him out into the
[24:51] wilderness
[24:52] just like Jesus Christ walked your sin
[24:55] all the way out into the wilderness it
[24:57] had to be a fit man for the job it had
[25:00] to be a strong man for the job
[25:02] Oh hallelujah that was not two goats but
[25:06] Christ represented both goats he is both
[25:09] your death and he is your resurrection
[25:12] I am identified when he died with him
[25:15] and I am identified and I rose with him
[25:20] hallelujah hallelujah to know him you
[25:25] don't have to know a whole lot you only
[25:27] have to know one person and that's the
[25:29] Lord Jesus Christ tonight it's not about
[25:33] you falling in love with me but falling
[25:35] in love with the music but falling in
[25:37] love with our excitement I know what
[25:40] you've fallen in love with me or my
[25:41] preaching for I will tell you but if you
[25:44] fall in love with Jesus too many people
[25:49] got themself a personality that they
[25:51] want to follow one of these days this
[25:53] whole flesh may die and right but where
[25:56] will you be if I die
[25:58] if the pastor dies you are the soul of
[26:00] God
[26:01] no matter what he takes away from you
[26:03] that you'll still sacrifice the God oh I
[26:09] wish somebody helped me preach tonight
[26:11] to know him his life
[26:14] to know him his life to know him as your
[26:20] personal Savior to know him as the one
[26:22] who has filled you with goodness and
[26:24] mercy let's send the world away from you
[26:31] discharged it and send it away like the
[26:33] scapegoat in the Old Testament to go
[26:36] into the wilderness to be killed no more
[26:40] and the very thing that made you sin and
[26:43] do things that you used to do has been
[26:46] driven away from you
[26:47] oh what a savior we have tonight oh what
[26:54] a savior we have isn't this Lord Jesus
[26:57] lovely that the things that you want
[27:02] spell/trap to when the devil knew your
[27:05] weaknesses throughout your lineage that
[27:08] you felt rap to this same Lord Jesus
[27:11] Christ
[27:12] drove these things away from you
[27:18] whoo Oh hallelu hallelujah
[27:23] somebody says Bend roll from me I
[27:29] believe that this lamb this lamb is
[27:32] perfect I believe that there is so much
[27:35] power in this sacrifice that there is
[27:38] healing in the sacrifice and I don't
[27:41] believe that God can just keep you or I
[27:44] don't believe that God can just heal you
[27:46] wants but I believe that you can stay
[27:48] healed I don't believe you have to keep
[27:51] dealing with it or here well I'm healed
[27:53] now and in two more weeks huh I'm gonna
[27:55] go battle the same thing let the healing
[27:58] vultures of Christ that float down from
[28:01] Calvary flow over your vessel and stay
[28:04] healed it's God's will that you stay
[28:07] healed
[28:08] I believe there's so much power in this
[28:11] sacrifice that one of these morning's
[28:13] it's going to raise you up between 6 and
[28:16] 9 there's so much power in this
[28:19] sacrifice that the devil don't know what
[28:22] to do with you there's so much power in
[28:26] this sacrifice that it will set your
[28:29] soda fly there's so much power in this
[28:33] sacrifice that the demons of hail can
[28:37] surround you because there's angels
[28:39] there to guard you there's so much power
[28:43] in the sacrifice
[28:45] [Applause]
[28:52] [Applause]
[28:54] power
[28:58] [Applause]
[29:03] he thought you were of great value so he
[29:06] gave up himself
[29:12] who could imagine how that Adam and Eve
[29:17] after walking out of the guard and there
[29:21] stood the surface with the flaming
[29:23] swords guarding to the Tree of Life how
[29:27] that they would walk out and no doubt
[29:29] they would have conversations with the
[29:32] boys and they would sit down and they
[29:34] begin to tell Cain and Abel what it was
[29:37] like in the garden Oh in the garden it
[29:42] was perfection in the guard and it was
[29:44] sublime
[29:45] there's not enough words in the
[29:47] vocabulary to tell you how perfect it
[29:51] was boys but these briars that you're
[29:55] dealing with now they were not there in
[29:58] the garden that rheumatism medicine that
[30:03] I have to take now I didn't have to take
[30:06] it in the garden those wrinkles you see
[30:09] over my brow they weren't there in the
[30:11] garden
[30:15] Missy in the garden that was perfection
[30:20] in the garden I could just speak to the
[30:24] mountain and the mountain will move in
[30:27] the garden I could speak to the breeze
[30:29] and the breeze would stop Oh hallelujah
[30:33] and in the garden in the garden there
[30:37] was no violence there there was no
[30:39] trials there there was no temptation
[30:42] there in the garden and these boys heard
[30:46] this and these boys the Prophet said
[30:48] that the boys wanted to get back to that
[30:51] garden all of humanity as a Christian
[30:56] has humanity throughout the years has
[30:59] spent their life getting back to that
[31:01] garden but I want to tell you we're
[31:04] going to a place of perfection that
[31:06] there is no more sickness there is no
[31:09] more rheumatism mess there is no more
[31:12] aging there is no
[31:14] or back pain but that's not just for
[31:20] their I believe you can live in perfect
[31:22] peace right now I believe there's so
[31:26] much power in the sacrifice that you can
[31:28] be healed right now you're a son and
[31:34] daughter of God speak to that mountain
[31:36] and watch it be moved everything may be
[31:41] violence around you but you can be
[31:43] surrounded by perfect blood the Prophet
[31:52] said that your name is indelibly roped
[31:55] Alleluia by the blood of the Lamb that
[31:58] means that your name cannot be erased
[32:01] from it Satanist rod has done that he
[32:06] has done his very worst to try to mark
[32:09] out your name Oh hallelujah but I want
[32:13] you to know how much Satan is against me
[32:15] it may be stacked up way this high it
[32:18] don't matter if it's time as high as the
[32:21] highest towers in New York City he tries
[32:24] very best to knock me off the book but
[32:27] my name is indelibly wrote there I hope
[32:32] you don't mind me because I'm going to
[32:34] be there I want you to know I sure don't
[32:38] mind spending time with you and worship
[32:40] because I believe it won't be there
[32:44] [Applause]
[32:55] wonderful wonderful things of God these
[32:59] boys were both religious I look over and
[33:02] I scripture reading these boys from both
[33:04] religious these boys both came to
[33:08] worship they both built in altars they
[33:10] had himself a church they both offered
[33:14] sacrifice they both were sincere but if
[33:17] that's all that is required if it's all
[33:20] as far as you have gone in your
[33:22] experience is that you have offered a
[33:24] point what a little bit that you know
[33:27] you have not went far enough come on
[33:30] somebody if how you think it is is just
[33:33] coming to the house of God and that's
[33:35] good enough when I'd never mind I'll
[33:37] just stay home and I'll string you've
[33:39] not gone far enough yet Cain was a
[33:46] worshipper
[33:47] Cain confessed he wasn't a hypocrite he
[33:52] believed God he wants of God
[33:54] he'd knelt down and prayed the Prophet
[33:57] said he was a good church member oh ma
[34:05] look and he watched Cain as he's
[34:09] bringing in the sacrifice here he is
[34:12] offering up this sacrifice bringing in
[34:16] of the fruits of the land but life
[34:18] doesn't lay in plant life only lays in
[34:22] the blood here a Cain was showing where
[34:27] he was from and Abel he takes the grape
[34:31] vine and he begins to wrap it around
[34:34] that lambs neck and he starts leading it
[34:38] up the hill and he starts bringing it up
[34:41] to the altar that he's built and then it
[34:44] takes that innocent lamb and lays it
[34:46] upon the altar he caught the revelation
[34:52] of worship but why did God receive Abel
[35:00] and condemned Cain because that Abel had
[35:03] recompense under the reward because Abel
[35:06] had a spiritual revelation and spiritual
[35:08] revelation of the will of God he caught
[35:12] the revelation that it was blood he
[35:16] understood that it was not apples or
[35:18] pomegranates whatever they choose to say
[35:20] today that kicked him out of Eden I was
[35:25] on a wagon one time in an apple orchard
[35:28] and I was riding down through air and
[35:29] there's a bunch of people on there and I
[35:31] was on the back of the wagon and there
[35:32] was somebody up the front of the wagon
[35:33] and they was telling that they had just
[35:36] found out that it was no longer apples
[35:39] or pomegranates
[35:40] it was a bright red fruit I thought oh
[35:42] if you just give me a chance I could
[35:45] tell you what fruit it was he was the
[35:47] payer on the ground he was not the Apple
[35:49] in the tree but I think they would have
[35:54] kicked me off the wagon after I went
[35:55] ahead and told him everything that there
[35:57] was true science has spent all of its
[36:00] energy trying to find the missing link
[36:03] but I should tell you and I can point
[36:05] you to a Kentucky hillbilly prophet that
[36:08] could so mind boggle the scientists of
[36:11] today I can't find it but yet a prophet
[36:20] looked all the way back and seen what it
[36:24] was
[36:26] whoo let me move on he understood that
[36:33] it wasn't fruit that caused the fall but
[36:35] it was the blood that brought them back
[36:37] into communion notice what brother
[36:41] Branham says and he recognized in an
[36:43] afternoon Lord he said Ben look the
[36:45] church carnal it's just the church
[36:48] carnal they never able to get above the
[36:50] little thing of I joined church if I go
[36:53] to church I have out there if I do the
[36:55] best I can that's all God requires now
[36:58] that's the same thing Cain done he went
[37:01] and made an altar he made a sacrifice
[37:03] and brought the fruits of the land and
[37:05] he said here it is God that's the best I
[37:08] got take it or leave it that's the way
[37:11] the carnal believer does today
[37:14] Lord I'll go to church I'll join the
[37:16] best group that I can find I'm paying my
[37:19] dues to the church I'll do what's right
[37:21] here's the best I can do
[37:23] I'll help buy some coal for the widow or
[37:25] I'll I'll give the children some
[37:27] clothing limbs alright nothing to say
[37:29] against it but that's it that's all if
[37:33] you want it if you want it take it if
[37:36] you don't you don't have to take it in
[37:38] now that's the attitude of the church
[37:42] call of the day take it or leave it God
[37:46] Here I am you can listen to doors and
[37:50] doors
[37:50] he don't want just the door to your
[37:52] bedroom and he don't want just the door
[37:54] to your living room
[37:56] he wants the door to your closing he
[37:58] wants the door to your upper room he
[38:00] wants the door to your heart
[38:01] but God I'll let you come in this far
[38:04] but don't you go to Medlin and the rest
[38:05] of my business you've not gone far
[38:07] enough yet Church carnal wants to go who
[38:12] oh well that's all I got
[38:14] take it or leave it but the church
[38:16] spiritual able by revelation by grace
[38:20] he's seen beyond that and my faith he
[38:23] offer to God a more excellent sacrifice
[38:26] than Cain and it testified of his
[38:29] righteousness notice Cain's attitude the
[38:35] Prophet said if if Cain would have done
[38:38] like his brother Abel God would have
[38:43] accepted it I know I just choked some of
[38:45] you but how to go ahead and swallow
[38:46] everything but if Cain would have done
[38:50] like Abel God would have accepted him
[38:54] but Cain showed where he was from when
[38:59] he hated his brother he shown who his
[39:01] daddy was hello and Abel shown who his
[39:09] daddy was he knew that there was power
[39:12] in his sacrifice he knew that this would
[39:14] bring communion to him and God
[39:19] now to sacrifice it's going to cost you
[39:23] something and what you're willing to
[39:27] sacrifice shows how much you want
[39:29] something you watch people spend four
[39:33] and five dollars for a box of cigarettes
[39:35] you see the sacrifice that they've got
[39:38] they'll sacrifice their children's money
[39:41] just to buy a pack of cigarettes or
[39:43] 6-pack of beer that won't last them
[39:45] through the night
[39:45] ain't no happiness and act but yet
[39:48] they'll sacrifice their hard-earned
[39:50] money or maybe they're bummed earn money
[39:54] just for a pack of cigarettes let's a
[39:59] knows going to put cancer in their lungs
[40:02] but in every sacrifice there is a cost
[40:06] to it you can look all throughout the
[40:08] Bible the burnt offering in the drink
[40:10] offering a fellowship offering and guilt
[40:12] offering the heave offering the middle
[40:14] offering the meat off for Anna peace
[40:15] offering the said offer in the thanks
[40:17] offering a trespass offering a wave
[40:20] offered and every one of those
[40:22] sacrifices and offerings there was a
[40:24] cost to it he becomes the worshipper
[40:27] something may be a lamb or turtle Dolph
[40:29] may be the meal of the land he would
[40:33] cost them something to bring them back
[40:34] into fellowship he saw it cause he saw
[40:39] something one Talent because his
[40:40] birthright to sell out for a mess of
[40:42] pottage Oh hallelujah but it only costs
[40:47] Jacob a mess of pottage for the
[40:49] birthright this he Esau's attitude
[40:53] towards it showed where he was from but
[40:57] Jacobs attitude towards the birthright
[41:00] showed that he was elected it's going to
[41:06] cost you something Samson knew that it
[41:12] was going to cost him something Samson
[41:15] you see God he gave God his strength but
[41:18] he gave Delilah his heart
[41:20] Samson gave out the secret of his
[41:23] strength and the Philistines came and
[41:25] overtook him and bound him plucked out
[41:27] his eyes next place you find Samson is
[41:31] down in the prison house ground ground
[41:34] and meal but Samson come to the final
[41:38] moments of his life and he was willing
[41:41] to sacrifice he said the trouble of it
[41:44] is today the church is not like Samson
[41:46] they're not willing to pay the price
[41:48] Samson prayed right when he prayed Lord
[41:51] let me die with the enemy he knowed it
[41:55] was going to cost him something he
[41:57] knowed it was going to cost him
[41:59] something it's going to cost you
[42:00] something he's going to cost me
[42:03] something your social prestige your
[42:05] place and position in the denomination
[42:07] Lord let me die he knowed it was going
[42:20] to cost him something and you must be
[42:22] ready to die out to your enemy to get in
[42:26] the blessings of God Samson was willing
[42:32] to pay the price to get the power of God
[42:36] again upon him he was willing to pay the
[42:42] price he was willing to sacrifice his
[42:45] life to get the power back one more time
[42:47] and the Prophet said are you will I
[42:51] wonder if you're willing to sacrifice
[42:53] your energies sacrifice your time on the
[42:56] internet or sacrifice your time on
[42:58] Facebook just to spend time in his book
[43:03] my pastor I asked you last weekend how
[43:07] many of you got a stroke you struggle to
[43:09] pray you struggle to read your Bible and
[43:11] all of you about every one of you raised
[43:12] your head it's a sacrifice to do it but
[43:19] it's a sacrifice of love
[43:22] the reason why you are you you struggle
[43:25] so much is because there is all enemy
[43:29] that's trying to keep you from the
[43:31] promises of God he's trying to block you
[43:34] from the promises of God but are you
[43:36] willing to sacrifice your all to get the
[43:39] power back you remember how it was when
[43:44] you first gave your heart to the Lord
[43:46] how that everything Singh knew
[43:49] everything was just perfect why can't
[43:53] you have that why can't you have when
[43:56] you walk back in and all of a sudden
[44:00] you're just like in an oasis in the
[44:03] desert what can't you have that love
[44:08] like your first had don't leave your
[44:11] first laws like the Ephesus church there
[44:14] but go back to that love you know we're
[44:23] willing we're willing to spend time in
[44:26] prayer for a headache we're willing to
[44:33] spend time in prayer for healing we're
[44:37] willing to spend time and for a little
[44:41] maybe petty things we're not willing to
[44:44] sacrifice ourselves on the altar we're
[44:50] not willing and died out all the way
[44:52] because we want to hang on to the world
[44:59] the Prophet said what's the matter today
[45:01] yes he said is that the church has moved
[45:04] its altar down to the basement and he
[45:08] said the only fire that they got is down
[45:10] in the basement hallelujah he said but
[45:13] what the church needs is an upper room
[45:16] old fashioned Pentecostal experience
[45:19] that bring the fire back again I believe
[45:23] you can have that fire I believe you can
[45:26] have that experience but you got to be
[45:28] willing to go all the way you got to
[45:32] draw the line and go all the way with
[45:34] God you got to go like David did and say
[45:40] I'm taking back everything that the
[45:43] devil stole for me you can have that
[45:45] fire back but bring me altar back into
[45:48] its rightful place we're allowed to
[45:51] rebuilt the altar and here here he made
[45:56] fun of all of the worshippers of bail
[45:59] and there was no fire that came down but
[46:03] with Elijah rebuilt the altar and put
[46:06] everything and restored everything back
[46:08] in its place and the fire came down what
[46:11] did it do he was God's approval of the
[46:14] sacrifice but I wonder what about you
[46:18] tonight why don't you let God come down
[46:21] and consume your life and consume your
[46:24] sacrifice if you want to check me on
[46:36] this I got this from Pinterest whatever
[46:38] they call that thing
[46:42] nothing great was ever accomplished
[46:46] without Megan sacrifices boy that's true
[46:52] nothing great was ever accomplished
[46:55] without making sacrifices I hope you
[47:02] bear with me just a moment
[47:04] last month was pastor Appreciation our
[47:08] pastor was out on an evangelistic tour
[47:11] and I didn't give get to give my chance
[47:14] I didn't get my chance to give my normal
[47:16] pastor appreciation speech so I hope you
[47:18] allow me in the month of November
[47:24] sacrifice has given back to God I did it
[47:31] I did some calculations on sacrifice
[47:33] today on these are on the low end so you
[47:39] can add to whatever you want to but I
[47:43] want you to know I'm very much
[47:44] appreciative of our pastor and what he
[47:48] has done for us and done for the kingdom
[47:51] of God
[47:52] [Applause]
[47:59] and we reverence we reverence and
[48:03] respect the gift of God that God has
[48:05] placed in our pastor and we appreciate
[48:08] his sacrifice upon top of sacrifices to
[48:11] preach this gospel and we're counting on
[48:13] him
[48:14] we're counting on him to lead us to the
[48:16] Spirit of Truth that will guide us that
[48:18] will be our comforter we're looking unto
[48:20] Him that will lead us to the true
[48:24] sacrifice but I did some I did some
[48:27] calculations today and you can be
[48:31] dismissed if you want to if I get on
[48:35] your nerves or if I burn you hide a
[48:37] little bit you're welcome to leave and
[48:38] then go hurt my feelings but I did some
[48:42] small calculations that average average
[48:49] driving time to church services weekend
[48:54] after weekend year all the way through
[48:56] the year that a hundred and four hours
[48:58] he spends driving to church normal
[49:05] church service throughout the years he
[49:09] spends three hundred and twelve hours
[49:13] here behind this pulpit he's gone 14
[49:21] times just this past year so on the low
[49:25] end he spent three hundred and thirty
[49:27] six hours in travel sometimes more he
[49:31] spent two hundred and twenty four hours
[49:34] in meetings in the past year sometimes
[49:37] more depending on who he was paired with
[49:44] so by doing a rough estimate he spent
[49:49] nine hundred and seventy six hours
[49:51] roughly a year in church you times that
[49:55] by thirty six years in the ministry
[49:58] thirty-five thousand a hundred and
[50:00] thirty six hours just to be in church
[50:07] but it didn't just start behind the
[50:10] pulpit it started at home so throughout
[50:15] his throughout the year he spends 11
[50:18] percent of his time just going to church
[50:21] but I'd say 100 percent of the time he's
[50:24] a Christian and I just want to say thank
[50:28] you
[50:28] [Applause]
[50:56] there's no way to calculate the cost
[50:59] they calculate the cost of travel but
[51:05] you say well maybe that's just that's
[51:07] just brother on well let me give you for
[51:09] an instance a brother and a family here
[51:12] I won't call their names so that you
[51:15] don't go ask um all kinds of different
[51:16] things you see one soul is worth ten
[51:22] thousand worlds so no matter the cost
[51:25] the value outweighs the cost but just a
[51:30] certain individual and his family spends
[51:33] two hundred eighty eight hours a year
[51:35] driving the church just driving the
[51:37] church they spent three hundred and
[51:39] twelve hours in service time so
[51:45] throughout the year they have five
[51:47] percent of their year just going to
[51:49] church they spent seventy four roughly
[51:55] seventy four hundred dollars a year in
[51:58] fuel just driving to church once so it's
[52:06] worth a whole lot more that seventy four
[52:09] hundred dollars a year spent spent that
[52:13] ain't that's 5% of that Christians that
[52:16] Christians year but 100 percent of the
[52:20] time they live in this message you see a
[52:25] lot of people think well man seventy
[52:27] four hundred dollars I could really do
[52:28] something with that but I'd say that for
[52:33] this individual that if it costs them
[52:36] fifty thousand dollars a year they still
[52:38] drive oh the way to get to the house of
[52:41] God no matter the cost
[52:43] it's worth the sacrifice
[52:49] but the held Hildebrandt one time went
[52:52] down to africa and each spent hours upon
[52:55] hours upon hours just getting there he
[52:57] got there he was war slap out and they
[53:00] were supposed to start the meeting as
[53:02] soon as he got there he went to the
[53:03] pastor and he told him say look I'm just
[53:05] wore out I've been traveling there's no
[53:07] way that I could preach tonight
[53:09] the pastor began to tell him well that's
[53:12] fine if who you want to do that but I
[53:13] just want to let you know this but there
[53:16] was a certain individual that has walked
[53:18] a hundred miles just to be in this
[53:20] meeting he said I'll be ready to preach
[53:22] you see we may be Navy and maybe work
[53:28] five minutes from church so 30 minutes
[53:30] for church or an hour from church or
[53:31] hour and a half from church but that is
[53:34] a very little bit two churches over in
[53:37] Europe or in Africa where they walk
[53:39] hundred miles or maybe they've got to
[53:41] get on a train and ride for 17 miles
[53:43] just to get in the house of God but it's
[53:46] a sacrifice but you know if you love
[53:49] what you're doing heat ain't a sacrifice
[53:52] of pain it's a sacrifice of love o
[53:57] Alleluia they don't hurt me to love God
[54:01] I love loving God it's not a painful
[54:05] sacrifice to worship God it's what I
[54:08] love to do we didn't get here by look we
[54:18] didn't get here by chance Full Gospel
[54:19] lighthouse we sacrificed a lot to get
[54:24] here you look all over this church and
[54:27] look at the pillars of this church there
[54:29] was a lot of hours spent in sacrifice
[54:32] building this building a lot of the
[54:35] newcomers come in and they look and
[54:36] think my goodness what a beautiful
[54:38] church but they don't understand the
[54:40] sacrifice that went into building this
[54:42] church hanging this drywall hanging that
[54:45] extra rafter up there that our former
[54:47] pastor almost fell all the way through
[54:49] the baptistry they don't understand the
[54:51] sacrifice of things they don't
[54:54] understand sisters
[54:56] bringing in meals just right before
[54:58] church time just
[55:00] they could have a meal and then turn and
[55:02] have Church right after that they don't
[55:05] understand that now brother Homer
[55:07] Frasier would work on this building he'd
[55:10] spend time working on this building
[55:12] changes clothes get behind the pulpit
[55:15] and preach people don't understand the
[55:18] sacrifice unless they understand or been
[55:21] man so don't take these things for
[55:24] granted that we've always been here you
[55:27] remember we started out in a basement
[55:29] you remember we moved up on the 33 and
[55:33] down the Summit Avenue and God blessed
[55:36] us with this church and good lord

[55:42] where we're going to be and time let's
[55:43] hold them protocol's come like I believe
[55:46] they're coming and they pack this place
[55:47] out and we have to rent Jair new but
[55:54] I'll say if we got a rich amu
[55:56] it's worth the sacrifice it's worth the
[56:00] cost I want you to know I'm not giving
[56:03] up and I'm not turning back I'm
[56:06] preaching this till the kingdom comes
[56:09] [Applause]

[1:01:44] good-for-nothing he lied and he cheated
[1:01:47] and he stole but the new man he walks a
[1:01:50] little bit different now he talks a
[1:01:53] little bit different now because why he
[1:01:56] got his whole self up on the altar he
[1:01:59] didn't care who was around he didn't
[1:02:01] care who laughed he didn't care who

[1:03:11] one more story it sounds like we're
[1:03:15] gonna have a part to all this you are
[1:03:21] very familiar for the story of blind
[1:03:25] bartimaeus how the Prophet would tell
[1:03:29] about blind Bartimaeus Halden
[1:03:31] how that he would make his living how
[1:03:33] that he had those two turtledoves had
[1:03:37] those two turtledoves that he would set
[1:03:39] down by the gate he would go down by the
[1:03:42] gate and he would have his turtle doves
[1:03:44] and they wouldn't make a little tricks
[1:03:45] and fly around in the air and flip
[1:03:46] around and people would throw money down
[1:03:48] at his feet that was the only source of
[1:03:50] income that he had sitting down in her
[1:03:53] bagging and those turtle doves we would
[1:03:55] bring him they would bring in income for
[1:03:57] him and his family but the Prophet said
[1:03:59] that one night that his wife got sick to
[1:04:02] her to a spot that when when blind
[1:04:05] bartimaeus went home he went into his
[1:04:08] prayer clothes and he began to pray and
[1:04:10] he says God God if you heal my wife in
[1:04:14] the morning I'll go up and all I offer
[1:04:17] my turtle doves and that's exactly what
[1:04:20] God did is he come down and healed his
[1:04:23] wife and blind Bartimaeus was good as
[1:04:25] his word he went up the next morning and
[1:04:28] he offered up his two turtledoves his
[1:04:30] only source of income but in those days
[1:04:33] there was no such thing as a as a as a
[1:04:36] blind leading dog
[1:04:37] as we have today but he had a lamb that
[1:04:40] would lead him that lamb was his eyes
[1:04:43] that lamb would take him through the
[1:04:45] gate and the lamb would take him back
[1:04:46] home
[1:04:46] it was his eyesight he would lead him
[1:04:49] through the city and he would go and he
[1:04:53] went back home and his daughter was at a
[1:04:56] point of death he went into his bread
[1:04:58] clothes and he prayed to God and said
[1:05:01] God if you'll heal my daughter I'll go
[1:05:05] up to the temple and I offer up my eyes
[1:05:07] I'll offer up my lamb and God come down
[1:05:12] and healed his daughter and restored her
[1:05:15] life back to her and bombard Emmaus went
[1:05:17] up the next morning to the temple to
[1:05:20] offer up his lamb that was his eyes and
[1:05:24] the Prophet said that when he coming to
[1:05:26] the temple nakai offices was here and he
[1:05:29] said bartimaeus he said what's she doing
[1:05:31] he said I've come here to offer up my
[1:05:34] lamb Caiaphas has said Bartimaeus you
[1:05:37] can't do that that lamb is your eyes you
[1:05:41] won't be able to go through the city no
[1:05:42] more if you offer abyss lehem he said
[1:05:45] I'll tell you what brought him here he
[1:05:47] said I'll give you money and you can go
[1:05:49] buy you another lamb and come back and
[1:05:51] sacrifice him he saw Caiaphas isn't no
[1:05:53] he said I didn't offer Hyden all for God
[1:05:57] a lamb he said I offer god this lamb how
[1:06:02] offer God this land God don't want your
[1:06:05] money
[1:06:05] God don't want your flowers God
[1:06:07] hallelujah God would chew on the altar
[1:06:11] thank God was as good to bartemaeus as
[1:06:16] my romance was good to God that one day
[1:06:19] the Lamb of God came by his way Oh
[1:06:23] hallelujah and he gave him a brand new
[1:06:26] set of eyes because he recognized the
[1:06:30] power of their sacrifice that it was
[1:06:33] worth everything
[1:06:36] hallelujah you may be in that spot that
[1:06:40] the Son of Man is walking past you but
[1:06:43] let this moment pass you by you may need
[1:06:47] your eyesight enlightened but I say cry
[1:06:50] out the more somebody may tell you to be
[1:06:54] quiet somebody may tell you that you're
[1:06:58] getting too much emotion you're getting
[1:07:00] more you're getting more attention than
[1:07:02] the preachers are getting but cry out
[1:07:04] the more the people around him said hush
[1:07:08] up he's done pasture but all Bartimaeus
[1:07:15] cried out the more that son of David
[1:07:19] have mercy on me he's passing mile this
[1:07:23] way are you willing are you willing to
[1:07:43] offer him your whole self his sickness
[1:07:52] and in health the good times and bad
[1:07:58] times whether rich or poor where do you
[1:08:03] live in a shack or you live in a mansion
[1:08:04] how you're willing to give it all the
[1:08:13] sacrifice came and the sacrifice didn't
[1:08:16] hold nothing back it was not a Roman
[1:08:20] spear that took away the life of Jesus
[1:08:25] and it was not the Jewish people that
[1:08:28] took away the life of Jesus for jesus
[1:08:31] said no man no man could take my life
[1:08:36] from me but Jesus gave His life friendly
[1:08:41] Oh hallelujah he sacrificed his life
[1:08:46] when no man could take his life he gave
[1:08:50] his life because he thought you were
[1:08:53] worth the sacrifice
[1:08:54] he thought that you were worth advancing
[1:08:57] I hope you feel in your heart when I
[1:09:04] feel here this moment I wonder I wonder
[1:09:15] if we would just give a little bit more
[1:09:17] I wonder if we just give a little bit
[1:09:22] more time a little bit more energy a
[1:09:25] little bit more praise a little bit more
[1:09:33] praise a little bit more time
[1:09:41] the Bible says I'm bringing it down in
[1:09:45] Hebrews 13 and 15 that by him therefore
[1:09:51] let us offer the sacrifice of praise to
[1:09:57] God continually that is the fruit of our

[1:13:30] energy to do it but through the plane

[1:14:00] power in your sacrifice it's a sacrifice
[1:14:04] it makes you free it's a sacrifice that
[1:14:07] makes you home it's a sacrifice and
[1:14:10] washes away all your sin you understand
[1:14:13] that the children of Israel when they
[1:14:15] were worshiping God after after they
[1:14:17] come out of Egypt and they were down
[1:14:19] there on the Red Sea and Miriam and all
[1:14:21] them sisters are down there on the banks
[1:14:23] of the Red Sea and they were praising
[1:14:25] God
[1:14:26] yes they were free from their captivity
[1:14:28] yes they were free from their bondage
[1:14:30] yes they were free from their slavery
[1:14:32] yes they were free from their
[1:14:33] taskmasters but they were not free of
[1:14:35] sin when David come dancing 17 miles
[1:14:39] backwards he danced so much that he
[1:14:42] danced his clothes right off of him
[1:14:46] David was dancing with lust still on him
[1:14:50] David was dancing with sin still on him
[1:14:54] if David and them could dance under the
[1:14:58] sacrifice of the blood of bulls and
[1:15:01] goats when there was only a covering of
[1:15:04] their sin and did not remit their sin
[1:15:07] what about you and I under the perfect
[1:15:09] sacrifice you can dance free from guilt
[1:15:16] you can dance free from your mistakes
[1:15:18] you can shout you can shout and offer up
[1:15:23] a praise because you're free from your
[1:15:27] sin you can sing like a bird because
[1:15:32] there ain't no shame on you
[1:15:35] the Bible says there are therefore no
[1:15:37] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[1:15:40] Jesus there is therefore amen now now
[1:15:54] now now amen
[1:16:02] they were is there for now
[1:16:05] amen you believe that there is there for
[1:16:13] now
[1:16:14] not somewhere in the future no
[1:16:17] condemnation tell me if you're in Christ
[1:16:21] Jesus how can you be condemned when he
[1:16:26] paid the ultimate sacrifice for you how
[1:16:30] can you have condemnation on you there
[1:16:32] is therefore now no condemnation to them
[1:16:35] that are in Christ Jesus who walk not
[1:16:37] after the flesh but after the spirit

[1:16:49] the dust on that create it when they
[1:16:51] were worshiping God they were
[1:16:53] worshipping under the blood of an actual
[1:16:58] lamb but you're not worshiping under the
[1:17:02] blood of just a natural lamb your bread
[1:17:04] your worshiping under those blood of the
[1:17:07] lamb of Almighty God and Satan has
[1:17:16] whispered in your ear that you have no
[1:17:18] rights he is my right he is my authority
[1:17:25] I got every right to praise God it may
[1:17:33] be a sacrifice for you but if you could

[1:17:57] of Isaiah 53 you would recognize he said
[1:18:03] even though you may have pain and you
[1:18:05] may have you may have these different
[1:18:07] things or ailments but in his spirit
[1:18:09] it's all over
[1:18:12] you may feel you may remember the things
[1:18:16] that you've done but in his spirit it is
[1:18:20] all over
[1:18:24] how you say these words there is power
[1:18:27] it must sacrifice let the musicians come
