church and there's no babies crying that church is dead amen amen so always remember that you prayed for this that's actually why we put thick carpet on the floor to absorb some of the sound and so amen so God bless you amen we love you we had a couple of weddings this week and Amen Brother John and sister charity got baptized in the immersion of marriage well thank the Lord it could have been worse it's been a long week folks I called in sick but nobody nobody would take the call that's the way it is brother Roger could we have a do over here brother John and sister charity my niece got married Brother David siler's son and sister charity and uh got married we were so pleased to be a part of that and so we went down on Tuesday and uh night to get there and then all day Wednesday we set up and had the rehearsal on Wednesday evening and and we were able to eat at the Martha Jefferson House and that was just really nice and and uh and then the the preparation for the wedding took place on on Thursday and then Thursday evening the wedding went off it was just beautiful sister Connie can you tell me what the name of the place was emry and Henry Memorial W you come up here and help me preach this morning the em and Henry Memorial Chapel and so it was Majestic and we just really we really enjoyed it a really beautiful place and brother brother Andrew and and uh Whitney Whitney sang in it and then others sang and so it was just beautiful and then we traveled on on Friday morning and uh brother step brother Steven and Amanda got married and all the way through the wedding I called him John so there's still some concern of whether they're legally married or [Applause] not so all I know is when they get mad she gets mad at him just call him John it was a beautiful wedding it was a beautiful wedding as well and so well I I take comfort in the fact that Moses was on the ark a lot of times with brother brandham so and so there we go and so amen amen I'm going to get there folks amen we we sure love you with all of our hearts amen just hang in there brother Dylan we'll get you baptized after a while and so I thought as the songs were being sang this morning they seem to just line up perfectly and this morning before even getting here I got a note from brother Seth coffee who is young preacher uh those that would know Sister Carla that would be in her family and he sent me a note that he had went through a really bad bout of depression I actually asked him would it be okay to share this with you he went through a bad bout of depression and he was just didn't know how he was going to come out of that he just you know I'm a preacher I shouldn't be going through this and and so he'll be listening to this and so this will help him as well and so he said I shouldn't be going through this I'm a Christian I shouldn't be going through this and brother Andrew had put out a a video and and in the video it was a it was testimonies it was testimonies that we had shared about the fire going through the fire you recently put that out and so and he said there was just one line in there that spoke to him and it said it just boom brought him out of of itah and so he said it just seemed like I was just going on and he said I I just something was holding me and I said well I sent him a text back and I said well that's quite interesting that you would send that this morning because I'm going to speak on what is holding you come on Amen I want you to just think about some things and I'm going to just share a few things before I go forward we are living in extremely Supernatural times brother Brandon would go through some times of when his baby died and the enemy would come to him and begin to talk to him and he said just when I was getting ready to give up something in me amen spoke out 1962 he came to another spot it's a transition of his ministry going from Evangelistic work even into even into prophetic work and he is at a time to where that he wants to get away from the pressures of life and even he was on the trip and I would like to share this at another time if I can in a more emphatic way but he was on the trip with brother bisc and brother bisell had no idea that brother brandham had these thoughts in his mind but he said I wanted to go away and be a Trapper he wanted to get away away from things the pressures of life here we are in a very pressurized age and in this pressurized age it seems like that Satan is using every force factor that he can to get into us because he don't have much longer to work with you and I knowing that you're the final voice to the final age and knowing that you're an invincible Army and and your position right just your position in prayer and your position in the body of Christ makes you more powerful than any other people on the Earth Satan knows that he has to use everything that he can to bombard your mind and bombard your spirit and in he in the spirit he uses your imaginations and your conscience and your memory and your affections and those things and and your imagination he goes in there and he begins to work but there's a place that he can't get to now he can work on your flesh and he can work on your spirit but there's a place even brother brandham said that God and the devil found a place to fight at it was in your mind and brother Brandon would preach a sermon called the greatest battle that's ever fought and call it greater than any of the other Wars that have ever happened but it takes place in your mind that's the place that they chose to fight at but in your soul in your soul is the place that he can't get to and that's where God placed that seed of eternal life down on the inside of you and we could sing the song something keeps holding me when your flesh and your spirit would give up it's that seed Gene of life that's been predestinated and elected by God not by some feebleminded man but by the infinite God God chose you I want you just think about the supernatural things that we're beginning to watch Maybe in a few days tombs from 2,000 years ago tombs from 2,000 years ago bodies that have went back to the gases and the ashes that are no longer to be found like granulars of sand will resurrect are you with me now we resurrect and step from that Dimension to this Dimension I think here's an incredible one all of us will be in one Accord all of us as a bride will be in one Accord we'll step into the vision so some of us are gray-headed some of us wear glasses some of us are stoop shouldered but in a moment in a moment all the agonies of your life will be fixed the impossibilities that there's no way for you to see in this moment everything will be fixed in that moment in spite of all the leoy and pressure that is around us every force that Satan is trying to keep keep you out of your position dimensions are blending Heaven and Hell Is has has loosed its forces upon the Earth and you're either influenced from Heaven you're either influenced from heaven or another dimension that would none of us want to go to and if you haven't had a reason to shout yet let me just say if you're influenced from Heaven it's a good spot to shout hallelujah hallelujah can I pick up from there and he said and when I saw him I fell feet is dead and he had his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not I am the first and the last I need a bigger book can I borrow your Bible feel not I am the first and the last I am I am he that was dead and behold I am alive forever more amen and have the keys of hell and of death Mark chapter 10 and verse 27 and I've just got a several scriptures here and Jesus looking upon them said and this is incredible scripture especially after I've just brought you through what we brought you through with men it is impossible but with God With God all things are possible now just to back that up Luke 1 and verse 37 says it just almost the same way for with God nothing I want you to put some emphasis on that nothing nothing shall be impossible Isaiah chap 53 and verse 1 and it's some of our favorite scripture who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plet as a root out a dry ground and he hath no form nor cess and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him notice the scripture he is despised and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows and a quain with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not I love this part surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken and smitten of God and Afflicted what powerful scriptures but he was wounded read this with me me and he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed Hallelujah I want you to notice that scripture it is written in such a personal away let's read it again and he was wounded for our he was bruised for the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are there's not a timestamp on that so that means that every reader amen boy he's here every reader when they read that scripture it is personal to them it came from the prophet's lips and it's putting on paper and then though it's been there for thousands of years it can jump off of the page and regardless of your condition of sin regardless of your depth of sin regardless of your condition of your body the same blood can take care of that in this moment brother Ron there just comes times to where I can't hold myself Psalms chapter 27 which is the rapture chapter verse 7 here oh Lord when I cry with My Vow with my voice have mercy upon me and answer me when thou sest seek ye my face and my heart said unto thee thy face Lord will I seek hide not thy face far from me put not thy servant away in Anger that thou had been my help leave me not neither forsake me oh god of my salvation have you ever felt forsaken have you ever felt alone have you ever felt the whole world was against you I'm preaching to the right crowd then when my mother my father and my mother forsake me then L the Lord will take me up when everybody else forsakes me then the Lord will take me up teach me thy way oh Lord and Lead Me in a plain path because of mine enemies Deliver Me Not O over unto the will of mine enemies for false Witnesses have risen up against me and such as breathe out cruelty notice these words I had fainted oh yes unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living you mean to tell me that David one of the greatest warriors that would ever live that would write all of these songs would say I had fainted unless I believe to see the lord of the goodness in the land of the Ling wait on the Lord and be of good courage and he shall strengthen thine heart weighed I say on the Lord hallelujah Revelations 1 and8 says I am the alpha in the in the be Omega I am the beginning and the ending Philippians chapter 1 and verse 6 being confident of this very thing that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ Isaiah 41 and verse 10 fear thou not for I am with thee be not dismayed for I am thy God I will strengthen thee yeah I will help thee yeah I will uphold thee at the right hand of my righteousness Joshua 1 and verse 9 have not I commanded thee be strong and of a good courage Be not Afraid neither be this made the Lord thy God is with thee whether soever thou goest Psalms 31 and verse 24 be of good courage and he shall strengthen your heart and all ye that hope in the Lord Psalms chapter 46 in verse one I love the scripture God is our refuge and strength a very present help in trouble therefore will we not fear for though the Earth be moved and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea though the waters thereof r roar and trouble though the mountain shake with the swelling thereof I thought about that scene right there this Earth is shaking this Earth is calling for our body change there is a river that streth whereof shall make glad and the city of God the holy place the Tabernacles of the most high God is in the midst of her and she shall not be moved God shall help her and that right early the Heathen raged the kingdoms were moved he uttered his voice and the Earth melted the Lord of hosts is with us the god of Jacob is our refuge come Behold The Works of the Lord and what desolation he have made in the earth he maketh Wars to cease unto the end of the Earth he breakthe bow and cth the spear in aunder he burneth The Chariot in fire be still and know that I am God I will be exalted among the Heathen I will be exalted in the Earth the lord of the host is with us the god of Jacob is our refuge Psalms 18 and verse 10 the name of the Lord the name of the Lord is a strong tower Hallelujah the name of the Lord is a strong tower Proverbs 18 and verse 10 the name of the Lord is a strong tower and the righteous run into Hallelujah and is safe let's read it together the name of the Lord is a strong tower the righteous run into and is safe John 7 and verse 38 said he that believeth on me as the scripture hath said out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Water I'd like to just take a few quotes here and just drop some things to you how did Jesus carry out his commission brother BR says in blind bardus and this is this is two different I've got two different places I'm going to pull from Jesus with his head back he's walking toward Calvary Jesus with his head back walking on the priest screaming at him making fun of him others crying hosana but did you notice the whole burden of the whole world rested upon Him Calvary dark hours in Gethsemane and all as he went he never noticed their scoffing come on he's walking toward Calvary brother Brandon would just have two sentences here I want to catch he had something on his heart as he's going to Calvary the decision has been made another place brother brandom would say and I just want to capture this quote he said let's just turn our our cameras to another picture sometimes I think as brother brandom's preaching being a prophet he's looking and he's actually preaching to us the vision that he's seeing that's right he said 4,000 years later we're in Jerusalem we're at a window and I hear a voice I hear a noise what is it a screaming mob hollering some poor man has come up against it and we'll raise up the shade and look out the window coming from down the streets there comes an Old Rugged Cross bouncing over the cobblestones bearing rubbing out the bloody Footprints of the bearer he's going to Calvary his back is beaten his ribs is showing through nurly there he starts up the road walking along as he's going look at him I look all over his back and there's little red spots all over His Garment as wo throughout the seam look at those little red spots what are they directly they're getting bigger and bigger and the bigger and the first thing they all run into one big spot there goes the second adom one brought death and here he's going one bringing life there's the one who took life out of the world and here's the one that's bringing life back to it the second Adam with his own blood hidden against his legs like that the Son of God going to Calvary to Bear Away The Sins Yonder and through the shedding of blood to perfect man and woman unconditionally no man can come to me except the father draws him and all that comes and I'll give him everlasting life and raise him up at the last day oh my there it is he's going up there I can see his little old bloody and that old something stinging around him death buzzing at him like a bee as he's going Yonder to the crucifix a bee coming around him saying oh I got you now I got you now and as it went moving and moving on that little bee was going to sting him God himself made flesh in order to take away sin I don't think we can preach this profoundly enough he says God the father and the spirit could not taste death of course he was super Supernatural but he had to be be made flesh and there he was dragging that cross on and that bee stinging around him death but you know what insects bees you all know that here you raise a lot of honey in the in this country and if a bee once stings it leaves its stinger and it cannot sting no more and God himself coming unfolding himself Out of Heaven made a flesh in the form of man took upon him the form of man and was going Yonder to Calvary to Anchor that sting of death and that sting stung the Son of God on the way to Calvary and he anchored and he pulled the stinger out of death and to death today death has no stink for believer Hallelujah for we are perfected in Christ Jesus there's the blood that's the blood of Christ and what it does the sting of death Paul when he was going to chop his head off that old bee busing around him and he said death worri is your stink grave where is your Victory but thanks be to God who gives us Victory through our Lord Jesus Christ brother B said what was it he said the Son of God 1900 years something ago this afternoon he was led from prison he was taken to the Judgment seat and from there the Hall of scourging from there to gol gotha pulled upon a hill Simon the Serene helping him to Bear the cross and there died on the Rock of Ages his blood beat out of him his body stripped Hallelujah great big old gobs of mocking of mocking Soldier spit upon his face and he had said if my kingdom was of this world I would ask my father and he would give me Legions of angels that would come and fight for me but this is not my kingdom but thy kingdom come thy will be done I think this is incredible how brother Brandon puts these things together and it will be here pretty soon thy kingdom come thy will be done now he quotes Billy Sunday and he said when Billy Sunday said one time he says that in every tree sat an angel and he said he could just pull your head hand loose and Point your finger that's all you'll have to do we'll settle the question down here my ain't that the truth Angels hanging on every tree sometimes we see the the power of God in what he says and what he does but there's a lot of even more power in what he didn't do are you with me now what do you mean by that that brother Ron he could have called 10,000 angels but you and I would be lost today he could have give up but he had a commission on his mind he knew he was sent here to die for the Redemption of me and you this was more than a king this was more than a great leader this was more than a great prophet this was God that stepped out of heaven and K flesh for me and [Applause] you I shared this with them this morning this is something that I just just touched my heart I was actually I was actually going through that Jonesboro where brother Brandon prays for that blind girl how many reminds that remembers that blind girl and she was there and cataracts had wrapped around her eyes to where she could no longer see doctors had let it go too far and wrapped around her Optical nerves and she was blind they had heard about the meeting they had heard about other Miracles happening they actually rented a bus to be able to come there when brother brandham prays for her when he prays for her listen there's there's thousands of people around that don't even know this is happening amen and I think that's incredible brother random is walking through a parking lot and it was a huge place I've been there he's walking through this huge Place thousands of people is there and brother brandom steps through and he steps through them all and he finds this black girl that is screaming for her daddy and she's lost and brother Braham has a conversation with her now the meeting's going on brother Braham has a conversation with her and she's telling him that we've come to see the Healer see the Healer and and brother brandham says that that he always told us that he wasn't the Healer Jesus Christ was the Healer and he's trying to get her to realize that Jesus is the Healer and she says but I got to get to that man you remember when she discovers that this is brother brandom that she's talking to she grabs him by the lapel of the coat and refuses to let him go wouldn't you I want to say this to you this is her moment I don't know how many years she lives but this is her moment I want to capture that how many real Supernatural moments do we get in life don't let it Escape you be sensitive to it and she grabs him and she holds on to him and she makes a statement to him she said on if you can give me to the Healer I'll be able to find my daddy listen if you can get me to Jesus everything will be all right if you can just get me to him preacher if you can get me to him he'll fix what I need fixed we didn't come to see a man we didn't come to get under the inspiration of a man we come to see Jesus [Applause] in brother branham's prayer he reminds the Lord of Simon the Serene because he was an Ethiopian man he was a black man he had two sons and he and he's brother Brandon reminds him that Simon carried your cross and in just a couple of moments that which was blind is now healed I begin to look at Simon Serene history has a lot of different things to say about him he was a man that was literally standing in the audience you know nothing happens by chance with God there's nothing happens by chance and he's standing in the audience and every we cannot even fathom what a wild scene that that was they were beating Jesus they were spitting on him they were mocking him they were doing everything that they could against him he was on a mission Thorns were down in his head to where that he would have stroke every time his heart beat blood had filled his eyes and now ran over his face was dripping off of his chin his ribs were open you could see as they would pull it Poli robe off of him his organs were beating inside because they had beat him in such a horrible way and still he's pushing on but I want you to just notice this man is standing at a very appropriate Place God watches over everything it's estimated that that cross weighed 88 lbs cuz he's only carrying the top 88 lbs there was no way for him to carry that three quarters of a mile to where he had to go and so they pick a man out of the audience to pick that up and to walk along theide of our savior this man will be known through the eternities as a man that carried the cross with Jesus I don't know what it felt like to look in his eyes those bloody eyes that day but I want you to know this there had to be every ounce of courage that he could give this Jesus called the Christ let's get this job done he must have felt the human energy and the god energy to move one step at a time I cannot imagine his anger as a man for them to keep pushing Jesus to the ground and keep spitting on him and keep beating him am amen I found a sentence that made more sense to me than ever before Jesus couldn't die on the road he couldn't die on the road so he had to have somebody to carry his cross he couldn't die there cuz he had to get there don't you worry about God's Mission being accomplished don't worry about you thinking what the rapturous way overd don't you worry it'll be right on [Applause] time you two have the same enemy brother BR would say it like this the devil hates me I know know he hates you too and he's my enemy I love this I'm trying to hold myself together and he's my enemy but as long as God's my friend I don't have no fear of him brother Ron you don't know what I've went through this last week well I I'm going to say this slowly and I want you to read it hi Hunter God bless you welcome to fatherhood again I I want you to I want you to say this with me if you've had some real trouble this week I want you to say it with me and say it loud the devil hates me devil hates me and I know he hates you too I know he hates you and he's my enemy he's my enemy but as long as God is my friend as God is my friend I don't have no fear of him Victory Day brother random says God lets disappointments happen to show Victory or if we could only see that you'd only see that these things that seems to be so burying you and upsetting you they are trials they are things to stand still and focus your glasses on the word of God and speak the word and this walk just walk forward and that's all that there is to it well brother Ron that's you know that must be just for you know you preachers don't have any trouble well if if you look at it that way probably we don't or you might all talk to some other preachers how many remembers the juniper tree Elijah's juniper tree brother Bram said some things here and he said men who deal in the Supernatural who stay in the presence of God when you see God's program turning down and you preach it and you just try your best and and do everything that God tells you to do and still they walk away from it it's heartbreaking and he said talking about Elijah he said poor little fella skinny laying there with his gray hair hanging out over his shoulders and God said God says my servant needs some rest think about that my servant needs some rest God's mercy to his servant he just laid him down on the on a bunch of weeds and and he went to sleep I wish I could put this in picture for him for you it's just so beautiful he said I'd imagine there was 10,000 angels watching him sleep there's one assurance that the believer has though the world turned him down yet God loves him the world may call you Holy Roller they may call you a atic but if you're true to God there's one sure thing God loves you and his angels are encamped about those who fear Him I'd imagine on every Lim all around through the place was swarms of angels and God came down and said my poor tired servant he's so nervous and tore up and he don't just know what to do I want to pick an angel standing here that's got the softest hands don't you scare him walk over and stroke his brow right easy and I want the best cook I want the best cook among you go there and get all the vitamins that you can find and and put it in cornmeal the world's turned him down but I'm going to treat him right God's talking to his angels the world has turned him down but I'm going to treat him right Hallelujah that means praise our God now now don't get scared of that he said bring forth the best that we got cook him a corn cake and set him down found some water and this soft-handed Angel went over there and stroked his little servant of God on the brow and remember if you've done your best God still got those angels in order he loves to just the same as he loves you just the same as he did Elijah and he stroked his brow and Elijah woke up and I may hear him say something like this the Lord God who loves you you've done your best Elijah I'm only sitting here with those signs for a witness in that day of judgment that they'll have to stand there it alone you've done just what you what what I told you to do I know you're tired and weary now and the Lord God creators of heavens and earth have sent me to here to feed you this bread and this water and Elijah rubbing his eyes and raised up little old frail shaking hands took a hold of bread and ate it now notice these words just then the great Angelic choir came out formed a little panoramic around him like that and be to sing the songs like no mother could coup to her baby to sleep and let him sleep again then father uh turned around and said you know I love him so much the journey is great and he's got a lot to go through yet but I'm not through with him so I've got to feed him again and he called the angels and dumped in another great big bundle of vitamins and and cooked up another great big corn cake and set him a cruise of water and stroked his brow fed him again again I got news for you Elijah was tired and wore out if you got Angels rubbing your brow and cooking you cakes and giving you water in the middle of a desert spot and then you go back to sleep after that you're War out and so God did it all over again for him well that was Elijah but how many times does he do that for you he'll refresh you and get you you back up and going and then you'll go through more battles and he'll come right back to you and bless you again and bless you again and bless you again somebody preach with me now these men didn't have Halos over their head and wings on their back they're humans like you and I they go through battles and they go through battles may you can't see the angels that are attending to you but they are he woke up feeling better I would too and he went from that spot 40 days and 40 nights now watch what brother Bram does with that he said I imagine if there's a doctor that's a listen in wouldn't you like to know what was in those vitamins that they used that would keep a man on a corn cake and a glass of water for 40 days and 40 nights that's the power of God sister Katie yesterday she made us some brown beans I'll be honest with you probably the best brown beans I've ever ate I really mean that that was was just really really good and we was just missing the corn cakes now can I turn her Focus to another place there was a Believer just like me and you called naboth how many remembers naboth naboth was a descendant of Abraham and if you remember when MDC was with with Abraham the king that had no beginning of days or ending of nights God God in a theic body and he's talking to Abraham about his children and he says thy seed shall possess the gates of their enemy so that means that they're going to have some Wars they're going to have some real battles and so as he's talking to him Abraham couldn't see one child you see Abraham couldn't see himself like God could see Abraham just the same way you are you're an invincible Army you're the final voice you're just hours before before the coming of the Lord God's time you're just only just a few minutes away so don't get in no go don't go get in no great big hurry but you see naboth owned a piece of property that Ahab wanted naboth's property was given to him by God are you with me and listen listen even the boundaries were laid out and they were given to him by God and so he was taken care of his Vineyard and he had a beautiful Vineyard and this Vineyard was so perfect and so wonderful that the king wanted it the king Ahab wanted it and Jezebel wanted it and so Ahab had a desire that he could have that and Neo refused to give the message up he said God gave me this message it was given by an angel from God it was in my family's Heritage and I refused to give an inch of this message up from the boundary of deity of Jesus Christ all the way to communion I'll not give it up I may not understand it all but I believe it he doesn't ask us to understand it he just ask us do you believe it and I say I believe [Applause] it so Ahab wants this piece of property and I'm just going to because it's a long time and and I'm running out of minutes and Ahab you know he goes in and he's cing he's all upset he's having a horrible time brother brandham said that he laid his head in je Jezebel's lap and she said as she stroked his head I'll get it for you I'll get it for for you don't you worry Ahab I'll get it for you and she devised a plan to cause men to create a lie to take it away from him his property away from him now I want you to understand that that this was property given by God if the enemy comes on your property the devil is going to answer for it listen if you're sitting here with cancer or whatever disease don't you worry one little Iota the devil is going to answer for it if these caus broken bones or broken hips or broken whatever and you're suffering let me just say don't you worry little bride the devil is going to answer for that now let me just share this quote I it's just too good and if if I go over time you get paid extra anyway we find out that Micaiah Micaiah was God's Prophet said he examined and he knowed what God had said through the real prophet and the prophet before him what did he say he said this Ahab because you've shed the blood of righteous the blood of the righteous nabo the dogs will lick the blood also and Jezebel and that's just exactly had to come to pass be because God had said how that that Prophet prophesied good when evil was against it are you with me now are you with me how can I tell this leot toan church ages the good things when God has spoken against it you're naked you're miserable and you say I'm rich I have better I have churches like the methodists and the Baptist and the Presbyterians I have this I have that the best that there is and that's right but don't you know you're naked and miserable and blind to the real thing that God has manifested it'll go right through you like the moving right right out people be believe people before it's too late now I want you to just watch this Ahab and Jezebel they have 400 prophets and they create a Great Horn and they come out there and they're all prophesying one voice they're all prophesying one voice go on Up And Take It Go On Up And Take It Go on up and take it but Jehoshaphat brother say was a Pentecostal said he was a Pentecostal he said don't you have one more 400 but don't you have one more more he said yes sir we do but I hate him I imagine they hated brother brandom in this day as well I imagine that's what a lot of them would say well you know we we got all this Unity amongst us and brother brandom's calling us blind naked and miserable and poor the the World Council of churches and we're hooked to the and I I imagine they they absolutely boycotted these meetings I'm getting ready to go to Saskatoon I'm going to stay right across when brother where brother brandham stayed literally right across the road from Brother brandham state do you know that those sorry outfit Preachers did the same thing that they did right here in Harrisonburg they told their people not to go to the meeting but they went bunch of sorry outfits they held their people away are you with me that's why brother brandom would say the disappointments at the judgment will not be the drunk will not be the Harlot but it'll be against those preachers that withheld the truth many of them know the truth but because of their pocketbook let me preach but because of their position brother Ron will withhold your check keep it just go on and keep it I'm not here for your money no way I'm here for your soul and I here with a vision to get you from here to there to preach this message that's got Rapture in it they went up there and talked to M Micaiah they warned him what he had to say what he would you know what Micaiah did he went up there and blessed them they knew they knew when he blessed them this wasn't right this wasn't right can you imagine brother Bram said go ahead you know God loves you a bunch of Jezebels on God loves your pant wearing he loves your sissified men they had to know something ain't right with this picture that's what we preach but that ain't what you preach come on you bet might as well amen you're on the right side he said go on up go on up something ain't right something ain't right and then he broke into the where he was he saw the vision of the word Micaiah said I saw God sitting upon the throne and he called all the delegates of Heaven said who can go down there and deceive Ahab watch what he says and one lying spirit came up and fell before God a liar and said Remember the that lion spirit that got into those prophets I got a couple things to do with so don't get done with me he said they ought to have known then that the spirit was on him wasn't according to the word of God but they were so carried away because everything they everything that Kings and the prophets that they said was everything was fine and that's what the church has done today yes they've got away from oldfashioned experience you had years and when you stood in the street in a corner and preached the gospel and said come out of those denominations and call yourself a pre free people nay because you've wrapped in it again like a hog to the wall now can you imagine God doesn't send an angel to get on those 400 Men He causes a Lon spirit let me just say something to you right here in our political system God's Got A Plan there's a pope let me go here before you get too mad there's a pope setting in Rome that seems like a very innocent human being right that kisses babies and rubs them on the head and makes all good kind of statements to say but one day there's a spirit from hell that's going to come on him and he'll make Hitler look like a poppy dog are you with me and he'll rise listen how do these leaders rise a spirit from another realm comes on them listen how did Abra press get where a Spirit came from another realm and got on him at one time he was singing in his Granddaddy's tent meeting singing the songs of Zion but another Spirit got on him are you with me it don't have to be that way it don't have to be that way in brother Danny steeman Church there was a beautiful woman she's an older woman and I don't remember remember her name today but she played in some of the movies with Elvis Presley and she had she had gained that kind of a Fame I sat across the table we talked about it and I I asked her I said what made you leave she said when they wanted to take my me to take my clothes off she said I'm going home to Mama and she walked out of Hollywood let me just say this to you God paid the debt now I'm bringing it to an end God paid her debt listen she didn't die no pulper she married an incredible man incredible man listen and listen she came to the message of the hour notice the protection of God some of you little ladies here that was in the world God watched over you and maybe you would have even chose to win a different way and that's the way you was going but the seed that was within you is what held you maybe he wasn't raised in the message how did you get here I'll tell you God brought you here and if I could say this if God watched over you then all through your journey I can say a million things right here but if God watched over you then when you had no knowledge of who was watching over you well let's just go ahead if you thought you'd send away your day of Grace and there was something still pulling on you how will I ever get back how will I ever get [Applause] back some of your old books was stinkers I'm coming to an end brother Dylan what in is important in your life is not what took place in the old book that's right can everybody stay with me just for a moment what is important in your life is not in the old book you as a man human being live in the same house that the old king lived in your memory will always be there but the seeds that you sowed bad they will come up but you sow enough good seeds to choke those seeds out [Applause] brother Jason would you stand just now yeah right there he had a really bad old book and you probably know some of his story but 99% of this audience doesn't know Jason's old story that's right and neither does he need to share it with them he did his time and that Jason is over with hallelujah hallelujah Satan May war with you what you used to be but you constantly remind him that's the old guy that used to live here I don't take his mail hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] give me just one or two more minutes you can be seated just a moment I'm I'm just going to preach to you is that all right because I'm actually preaching to Mary sitting right behind you and I'm preaching to you you came with him what two or three years ago first time you'd ever been here but something got a hold to you and you only come with him because he was he was with you and he brought you here since that service you have hardly missed one service you've been here I want to ask you what held you you couldn't hold yourself God held you what held you it's the same thing that held Jesus as a man that caused him to keep taking one step at a time it was the same thing that held Elijah under a juniper tree when he was ready to give up it's the same thing that held nabbo that said God gave me this property and I refuse to give up but maybe sister Kimberly would ask the question but he died you're not reading the rest of the chapter it's not written there but listen he stepped from this Dimension to that Dimension he never lost an inch of his property [Applause] if I die today I'll be more alive there than I am here [Applause] about two months ago I'm preaching here and then I'm done I'm preaching here I'm full blast in the service and I'm preaching and all of a sudden God speaks to me and says call Katie and Hunter down to have prayer for them and for that baby Quinn has been under doctor's cares and they've did a phenomenal job with him but Hunter and Katie which you sometimes don't realize it was in a service like this in the middle of a sermon that God just said just a moment I got a case that I've been working on and I want them to know I'm working on the case they don't know what's laying ahead but I want to give them confidence and courage they're going to be days and weeks under doctor's care but the great Physicians telling them I got this [Applause] there are sometimes that a service is more than a service amen amen can we just bow our heads a moment now God just didn't direct me to preach this sermon like this just to leave it done but I want to ask you who in this building has been going through Wars the last couple of weeks yes thank you thank you war god thought of you to remind you I got a juniper tree for you and I'm going to have angels to rub your head and I'm going to give you corn cakes that'll sustain you I'll give you a message that'll help you just feed on it just take care you're not alone I'm with you

of his sins no doubt he's went through and begin to cleanse things out of his life I'm not going to I'm not going to to have that no longer in my life no longer am I'm going to participate in those things but now he wants to be Washed by the Water of the word be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and take on your name but there's a promise that goes with that that he can be filled with the

walking on the water W he can save your soul if you give him control get ready for that judment day I said let's all go down to the river oh there's a man walking on the water where he can save your soul you give him control get ready for that judement [Music] our God is a faithful God he is mighty to be praised the Bible tells us in in Matthew chapter 28 that Jesus told us to go therefore and to teach All Nations baptizing them in the name of the father Son and the Holy Ghost and Peter grabbed the revelation of that and stood there on the day of Pentecost and said Brethren they asked him said men and Brethren what shall we do he said repent in the name of Jesus Christ be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remissions of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost there's a lot of people that do not believe that God still gives a holy ghost but Peter stood there on that day as as the leader on the apostolic age he stood there and said and This Promise is unto you and to them as many as our Lord Our God shall call amen if you wouldn't mind just flashing up Romans chapter 6 verse one please what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that Grace May abound God forbid how shall we how shall we that are dead to sin Liv in any longer therein know ye not that as many of you as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in a newness of life for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection this last verse knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth that we should not serve sin for he that is dead that's right is freed from sin just just forgive me a little bit about this just for I'm I'm super excited about this moment I woke up praying about these things several years ago probably five or six years ago you brought brother Dylan to our home and brother Dylan was in a bad place and we watched the Lord completely take a man that was that was strung out on drugs in that moment and clear him up clear him up in a matter of seconds but Dylan went back to those things again but this time it's different that's right for he that is dead is free from sin the old man has died that uh that quotation from the fourth seal sister you forgive me we got some we got some demons to bury here you can't have a resurrection you must be crucified to the things of the world in order to be resurrected in Christ and if you're going to depend upon your intellectual conceptions and so forth you'll never be born of the spirit of God you've got to forget like Paul did and all that ever know and know nothing among you except Christ Jesus born a new of fresh oh if I could get if I could get it to you see it's it's a birth that makes a new generation or a new creation the G very Greek word here as I was looking it up in the Greek Lexicon the other day the word birth means creation when it says you are a new creatures in Christ Jesus there's a word there creature is the word creation you are a new creation in the world but in in Christ Jesus you've been born a new that was from question and answer so let me have uh from the fourth seal let me why why we got that scripture why we got that quotation there that's what the Bible said in 2 Corinthians 5: 17 that if any man be in Christ he is a new creature the old things are passed away brother David Pierce was was when he first gave his heart to the Lord he came here he was he was shung out he was he was an alcoholic and he was he was he was a man that had been ever since he was 13 years old that was drinking liquor ever since he started from those days on but he had a he had a little app on his phone and he was looking at it and he was walking back he was walking back to the liquor store and while he's walking back to the liquor store it pops up on his phone if any man be in be in Christ he is a new creature he said it's over that's the last time he ever touched it ever again this is exactly what brother Ron was preaching today that's what the blood of Jesus Christ does to the true child of God when the confess when they when he confesses that sin and stands there justified in his mercy and his goodness even if it's great till God said I can't even remember it anymore and he's absolutely my son verily I say unto you if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe in what you have said it shall come to pass you can have that what you said you are redeemed son amen that's true I've seen squirrels to appear Yonder in the six different times that I knew one that would be sitting here just as he can create squirrels the same as he can create flies or frogs or anything else he's God the Creator right and when no mortal being but when that sin of that mortal is confessed and dropped into the Clorox of the bleach of Jesus Christ that bleaches all sin that he's purely that he is purely that he is purely I got to find he is purely unadulterated without sin without fault he that is born of God does not commit sin for he cannot sin well you see how is that possible because the Bible said in 1 John 3 and9 for he cannot commit sin for the seed of God remaineth in him it ain't brother Shannon seed it's God's seed that dwells on the inside of him the old man is dead that's right and if anybody comes up from your past you just telling them the old Dylan ain't here no more that's right for I am alive in Jesus Christ oh yeah the bleach stands between him and God how could it ever got there when it breaks it up and sends it right back to the one who perverted amen woo I feel religious I tell you I get stimulation now as it begins to reveal so when he confessed his his sins it ain't his sins no more it goes back upon the head of the one that perverted it from the very beginning that's why Satan tried his very best to keep him from getting here it's because he didn't want him confessing and all the things that he ever was are over and back upon the head of Satan now the blood of Jesus Christ makes Dylan shifflet a Brand New Man in Christ Jesus today it is my honor to bury brother Dylan shifflet from this day forth you will never never remember him as the man that was but you will remember him as the man that Jesus Christ is going to make him remember this day brother Dy I'm so proud of you amen I can't imagine how your father feels cuz I know how I feel because today we're not just bearing you in a watery grave it's a sign of what God has done on the outside this is just showing to the rest of your world that what Christ has already begun a good work in you and he will finish it now God gave us a promise that if we repent of our sins that word means to turn away to never go back to for the remissions of our sins that he would give us the Holy Ghost you have repented you've asked for forgiveness now our Lord Jesus Christ is standing here in this water to baptize you with the Holy Ghost because that is his promise father I come before you Lord Jesus as a man of God God I stand here under the badge of my authority and I have come to baptize my brother in The Most Holy Name that there is it's not a name just given amongst men it is a name that is given to us where all men should be saved by the name of Jesus Christ now there's many of jesuses but there's only one Jesus Christ and I ask that the anointed one would come here today as I get ready to bury brother Dylan shifflet in this watery grave I pray pray father that you would raise him up to walk in a newness of life and I pray God as I stand here in this water I pray that you would forgive him and that you would feel him from the crown of his head to the souls of his feet may he may you raise him up to be a witness of the holy spirit that God still changes and delivers and sets free so father according to Thy word where you told us to go into all the world and to preach and to baptize him in the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost we stand here under that commission and I baptize Dylan shifflet in the name of Jesus Christ [Applause] what a glorious day a't it there were
