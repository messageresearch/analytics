[51:03] even as i stand here
[51:06] lord i i'm not standing here just to
[51:09] try to prove something
[51:11] it's because of you
[51:13] and lord i i trust you even this morning
[51:16] that you'll give me wisdom
[51:18] speak to our hearts
[51:20] something that's been laid heavily on my
[51:22] heart as the week has progressed
[51:25] i asked you that you would anoint us in
[51:27] a very
[51:28] supernatural way
[51:30] last night's service repentance
[51:32] i thought that was one of the greatest
[51:34] messages i ever heard on repentance
[51:38] right attitude the right atmosphere
[51:41] and lord every one of us have to repent
[51:43] every day
[51:44] brother branham said i have to check up
[51:47] every hour of the day
[51:49] lord god give us a spirit
[51:51] to where that we would have a
[51:53] willingness to repent
[51:55] a willingness to surrender ourselves to
[51:58] you
[51:59] touch your lord touch your children
[52:01] today
[52:02] sweep across this audience we are
[52:05] already aware of your presence here now
[52:08] bless your children in jesus name we ask
[52:11] you
[52:12] amen and amen and amen amen god bless
[52:15] you
[52:16] if you will turn with me to matthew
[52:17] chapter
[52:18] 5 and verse 13.

[52:27] matthew 5 and verse 13.
[52:32] amen
[52:34] amen
[52:40] amen
[52:44] amen
[52:55] hey man
[52:57] are you with me now
[53:00] jesus is standing and he's talking about
[53:02] us even here today
[53:05] you're the salt of the earth
[53:08] but if the salt has lost his savior
[53:11] wherewith shall it be salted it is sends
[53:14] forth good for nothing but to be cast
[53:17] out and to be trodden under the foot of
[53:19] men
[53:20] ye are the light of the world
[53:24] a city that is set on a hill
[53:27] and cannot be hid
[53:29] neither do men light a candle
[53:32] and put it under a bushel
[53:34] but on a candlestick
[53:37] and it giveth light unto all that are in
[53:40] the house
[53:42] let your light
[53:44] so shine before men that they might see
[53:47] your good works and glorify your father
[53:50] which is in heaven i'd like to for us to
[53:52] read that scripture together there if we
[53:54] can
[53:55] let your light
[53:57] so shine before men
[53:59] that they may see your good works and
[54:02] glorify your father which is in heaven
[54:06] you may be seated
[54:20] i had two such dreams this week that i
[54:22] would want to share and base this sermon
[54:25] on
[54:26] awesome job on that song
[54:29] one of the dreams was that
[54:33] another minister and myself we were
[54:34] together
[54:38] somewhere i just say this somewhere
[54:40] because i have no basis of
[54:42] of what it was it was just the theme of
[54:44] it
[54:45] i just don't know
[54:47] and we was asked to inspect a building
[54:52] and this building had no foundations the
[54:54] walls was leaning the floor was kind of
[54:57] it was kind of
[54:59] it was an unlevel it was it was waving
[55:02] people were wanting to live in that
[55:04] condition
[55:06] but they ask us
[55:08] is this a livable situation
[55:13] whether it was a church
[55:16] or whether it was a
[55:18] people we were instructed to tell them
[55:21] to
[55:22] tear it down to the ground
[55:25] and restart it
[55:28] and have a right foundation
[55:31] when i heard the sermon last night
[55:34] on repentance
[55:36] it reminded me of that dream sometimes
[55:39] you got to go back
[55:41] right back to the start
[55:44] or those little things that have crept
[55:46] into your life
[55:49] brother wayne spoke last week he said
[55:51] that door going open back and open back
[55:53] and open he said at night he said that
[55:56] one fly or that one mosquito in the room
[56:00] or maybe just multiples of them you hold
[56:03] the door open long enough
[56:05] sometimes it's kind of like that
[56:07] principle of
[56:09] of the strong man of the house
[56:11] the scripture tells us that
[56:14] one enemy will come back and he will see
[56:16] if
[56:17] if the the floor is garnished if you're
[56:20] filled with the holy ghost and if the
[56:23] strong man christ is not living inside
[56:25] of there he will return to the house
[56:29] but he brings seven worse
[56:34] there was a young man that left the
[56:35] message and
[56:37] he called me in a very abrupt
[56:39] conversation it was matter of fact it
[56:41] was so abrupt that i recorded the
[56:44] conversation because he made a life
[56:46] threat to me
[56:47] and so
[56:48] he told me he said i can control myself
[56:53] and i said let me just say this to you
[56:55] no human being
[56:58] without the holy ghost can control
[57:01] themselves
[57:02] men can make vows and men can make
[57:05] promises
[57:06] but humanity
[57:08] always disappoints us
[57:14] are you with me
[57:17] humanity will disappoint you
[57:20] that's why people can do so good for a
[57:23] certain spell of time and then all of a
[57:25] sudden they hit a bump
[57:28] and the devil will leave them for quite
[57:30] a spell but then he'll come back
[57:33] and then they'll just disappear it's
[57:36] because the enemy re-enters again and
[57:39] begins to charge their lives and takes
[57:42] them into chaos
[57:45] sin is a road that will take you further
[57:48] than you ever thought
[57:51] you ever
[57:53] people go a certain way and then they
[57:55] think i'll never go there
[58:01] i'll never go there
[58:03] brethren would make that statement
[58:06] he would say look at your life he said
[58:08] you're either tonight you're either
[58:10] going to be a better christian five
[58:12] years from now a pillar of the church
[58:17] or you could be in hell
[58:19] or a drunkard or all of these different
[58:22] things
[58:23] sometimes we we don't realize that we're
[58:26] charting a course
[58:31] we're chatting of course
[58:33] choices that
[58:34] are made
[58:36] and that's why repentance is
[58:38] so important
[58:41] never lose the value
[58:44] of of true repentance
[58:46] without true repentance
[58:48] there's no sealing of the holy ghost
[58:58] now you know i'm not faking
[59:03] another this week
[59:06] was i found myself going to a
[59:09] a huge
[59:11] never seen anything quite like it
[59:14] a huge building
[59:16] a huge place
[59:19] to where that i needed a token to get in
[59:25] and i had a
[59:26] it was a it was kind of a symbolic i had
[59:29] a token
[59:30] and there were people that were trying
[59:32] to get in
[59:33] but didn't have a token
[59:36] but i was standing there with a token
[59:41] and it seemed like that that connie
[59:45] and my family were taken to a different
[59:48] sort of gate but i was taken alone in a
[59:51] certain situation to this gate and i had
[59:53] a bag on my back
[59:55] it was kind of like a
[59:57] i don't know how to say it
[59:58] can i use the term hippie sack
[1:00:03] and
[1:00:05] and it seemed like the man at the gate
[1:00:07] was there he he looked at he called me
[1:00:09] by name and
[1:00:11] and i recognized him but i really didn't
[1:00:13] know him
[1:00:14] and he said
[1:00:16] ron
[1:00:17] what are you doing with that bag
[1:00:20] i said well i brought it with me
[1:00:22] and he said well here just pour it out
[1:00:24] here
[1:00:26] and i poured it out and he said there
[1:00:28] are burdens
[1:00:30] he said you've been carrying a lot of
[1:00:32] burdens in your life
[1:00:34] he said no you can't bring them here
[1:00:53] i went into the feast
[1:00:56] and i won't take time but
[1:00:58] i went into the feast and saw many loved
[1:01:00] ones there
[1:01:02] but i once i saw one sister that i led
[1:01:04] to the lord that
[1:01:06] she was deaf and dumb
[1:01:09] and she was just full of conversation
[1:01:12] telling me how much she loved me
[1:01:14] and how good it was to see me
[1:01:18] oh what a place that's going to be
[1:01:28] the scripture said out of the mouth of
[1:01:30] babes
[1:01:32] this week we had a situation happen in
[1:01:34] whitney and davie's home
[1:01:38] i'm gonna do the best of this i
[1:01:40] he says
[1:01:42] mom and dad does everyone have jesus in
[1:01:44] their heart
[1:01:46] and whitney says
[1:01:48] no baby they don't
[1:01:50] and they respond to him you must ask him
[1:01:53] to come into your heart
[1:01:56] and he said that's he said
[1:01:59] he says that's right he said
[1:02:01] the ones who have jesus in their hearts
[1:02:04] have lights around them
[1:02:07] and the ones that who don't
[1:02:10] they're dark
[1:02:14] i want to remind you just a moment he's
[1:02:17] three years old
[1:02:20] i want to think for a moment as i heard
[1:02:22] him i heard that conversation had been
[1:02:24] had
[1:02:25] and the week was progressing i
[1:02:28] i thought for a moment i saw him
[1:02:31] three years before he was ever born
[1:02:35] and through all the impossible odds
[1:02:39] he came on the earth
[1:02:43] and now
[1:02:46] you know now he's beginning to see this
[1:02:48] light
[1:02:50] as a small child
[1:02:52] i pray that's in every one of our homes
[1:02:54] not just for isaac
[1:02:56] but in every one of our homes that our
[1:02:58] children see
[1:02:59] there's a difference here i i we might
[1:03:03] want that for your children i i want
[1:03:05] that for your home
[1:03:07] listen this is a must-have
[1:03:12] this is more than just a message that
[1:03:15] we're associated with
[1:03:17] this message is christ
[1:03:20] and we came from god
[1:03:24] and we're going back to god
[1:03:28] now if i could just take these thoughts
[1:03:31] just for a quick summation
[1:03:33] we're being sealed for the journey
[1:03:39] this is our final preparation hours
[1:03:43] it's time to go
[1:03:46] it's time to go
[1:03:50] and i want to say some some things here
[1:03:52] to the today
[1:03:54] jesus would say in luke chapter 14.
[1:03:58] a certain man made a great suffer and
[1:04:00] made many
[1:04:02] and he sent his servant at supper time
[1:04:04] to say to them that were bitten
[1:04:07] come
[1:04:08] all things
[1:04:10] are ready
[1:04:12] and they with one consent begin to make
[1:04:15] excuse
[1:04:19] the first said i have bought a piece of
[1:04:20] ground and i must needs to go and see it
[1:04:23] i pray that you have me excused
[1:04:26] another said i have five oxen
[1:04:30] and i must prove them i pray that you
[1:04:32] have me excused
[1:04:35] and another said i have married a wife
[1:04:38] and therefore i cannot come
[1:04:42] so that servant and showed his lord
[1:04:44] these things
[1:04:45] that the master of the house being angry
[1:04:47] said into his servant go out
[1:04:50] quickly into the streets and the lanes
[1:04:52] of the city and bring in hither the poor
[1:04:55] the man the hot and the blind
[1:04:59] and the servant said lord it is done as
[1:05:01] thou has commanded and yet there is room
[1:05:04] and the lord said unto his servant go
[1:05:06] out into the highways and to the edges
[1:05:09] and compel them to come that my house
[1:05:12] may be filled
[1:05:14] for i say unto you that none of these
[1:05:16] men which forbidden shall taste of my
[1:05:20] supper
[1:05:21] what a state
[1:05:24] this was not a preacher saying this
[1:05:26] this was god himself
[1:05:31] and listen there were many more
[1:05:32] qualified than us
[1:05:38] many more qualified than us
[1:05:41] that tasted
[1:05:43] of the great things maybe even of the
[1:05:46] message of the allah
[1:05:49] but came so close
[1:05:52] and walked away
[1:05:56] and jesus
[1:05:58] they had all their excuses
[1:06:01] and i'm going to say some blunt things
[1:06:02] here in just a moment
[1:06:06] but how close that we can come
[1:06:12] and miss it
[1:06:13] we can easily talk of the rich young
[1:06:15] ruler
[1:06:18] how many people has occupied pews
[1:06:23] i'm not just talking about here
[1:06:25] i'm not just talking about a single
[1:06:27] person or or a group of people that
[1:06:29] don't matter
[1:06:33] just believe the sign situation that
[1:06:35] happened about 10 years ago in the
[1:06:37] message where are those people at now
[1:06:42] when the folly of all of that nonsense
[1:06:44] fell apart and our lives are fell apart
[1:06:47] it's kind of like a feather tick pillow
[1:06:50] you throw it in the air and all of those
[1:06:53] those feathers go everywhere
[1:06:57] now to get it all back in the bag you
[1:06:59] it's impossible for you to get it all
[1:07:01] back in the back
[1:07:03] it's kind of like a rumor it's
[1:07:04] impossible to get it all back in the
[1:07:07] back
[1:07:19] genesis chapter 7 and verse 16.
[1:07:22] this is noah
[1:07:25] and they that went in went in male and
[1:07:27] female of all flesh
[1:07:30] and god commanded him
[1:07:32] and the lord
[1:07:34] shut him in
[1:07:37] and the flood
[1:07:39] was 40 days on the earth and the waters
[1:07:42] increased and bear up the ark
[1:07:45] and it was lift up
[1:07:48] above the earth
[1:07:51] i want you to just notice noah didn't
[1:07:53] shut the door
[1:07:56] many years ago in the 80s they began to
[1:07:58] preach that mercy was over i'm really
[1:08:01] glad that mercy was not over
[1:08:04] mercy is not in the feeble hands of any
[1:08:07] man
[1:08:12] it's not in the feeble hands of any man
[1:08:15] me and you still need mercy
[1:08:18] we still need healing
[1:08:20] we still need repentance
[1:08:30] jesus would use this quotation
[1:08:34] blessed is he
[1:08:36] who is not offended
[1:08:39] in me brother wayne touched it last week
[1:08:44] how close that we can come
[1:08:47] and miss it
[1:08:48] listen to brother branham he said i
[1:08:50] talked to my nephew
[1:08:52] a while a little catholic boy
[1:08:54] and said he said uncle bill i've run
[1:08:57] from pillar to post going everywhere
[1:08:59] trying to find something
[1:09:02] night after nothing before this meeting
[1:09:04] started he has been crying and at night
[1:09:07] time he's been dreaming dreams and
[1:09:09] coming in running up to the altar we're
[1:09:12] preaching and making confession that's
[1:09:14] that he's been wrong
[1:09:16] and i said melvin
[1:09:18] no matter where you try to go
[1:09:21] how many churches you join how many hail
[1:09:24] marys you say
[1:09:26] how many blessings that you get from man
[1:09:29] you've got to be born again
[1:09:34] notice how close he was to a prophet of
[1:09:38] god
[1:09:39] his uncle
[1:09:42] and he was missing what god had put
[1:09:45] before him in his life
[1:09:59] i'll live
[1:10:04] what about this message
[1:10:08] think deeply about it
[1:10:12] does this message offend you
[1:10:20] many times we want to argue with certain
[1:10:22] points of the message
[1:10:25] and this is something that have always i
[1:10:27] may have never said this from the pulpit
[1:10:29] but i always has been a backdrop of my
[1:10:32] ministry
[1:10:33] brother branham was fellowshipping with
[1:10:35] an angel
[1:10:40] brother branham was not just
[1:10:41] fellowshipping with men with the full
[1:10:44] gospel business men
[1:10:46] are powerful men
[1:10:48] brother branham had met an angel in a
[1:10:51] cave
[1:10:55] brother branham's ministry is going to
[1:10:57] fulfill malachi 4 5 and 6 and
[1:10:59] revelations 10 and
[1:11:01] luke 17.
[1:11:02] listen he is fellowshipping with an
[1:11:05] angel
[1:11:07] that watched creation come into
[1:11:10] existence
[1:11:11] watched adam and eve in the garden of
[1:11:14] eden watched every trial throughout the
[1:11:17] scriptures
[1:11:23] i will take brother branham's thoughts
[1:11:29] over any man
[1:11:41] that might gulge your hide just a little
[1:11:43] bit
[1:11:44] but you and i
[1:11:45] have not fellowshipped
[1:11:47] with that kind of fellowship
[1:11:52] and i want to say this to you
[1:11:54] brother branham recognized that that
[1:11:57] angel that picture that we most of us
[1:12:00] have hanging in our wall that that was
[1:12:02] the only
[1:12:04] supernatural photo of the pillar of fire
[1:12:08] that's ever been recorded in history
[1:12:12] we would have missed that
[1:12:15] had it not been a prophet said that's
[1:12:18] him
[1:12:20] we were lost in our denominational
[1:12:23] thinking and we needed to be washed
[1:12:31] we need to be washed and repent of our
[1:12:34] creeds and our dogmas and our and the
[1:12:37] things that we were taught
[1:12:41] are you with me the dress codes of the
[1:12:44] denominational systems
[1:12:47] we need to be washed of those things
[1:12:50] where you can have a preacher that's
[1:12:52] married four or five different times or
[1:12:54] smokes or drinks
[1:12:57] listen the holy ghost is more than just
[1:12:59] an emotion
[1:13:02] the holy ghost is life
[1:13:05] and we needed a prophet that exhibited
[1:13:08] not only the word
[1:13:10] and signs and wonders but the life
[1:13:16] [Applause]
[1:13:24] but brother ron haven't you noticed that
[1:13:25] brother branham made mistakes
[1:13:28] he was a human being
[1:13:30] we don't worship william branham i don't
[1:13:32] know if you've not been around here long
[1:13:34] enough but we don't worship the man
[1:13:36] william branham
[1:13:37] but we have incredible respect for him
[1:13:40] but if you turn that microscope on
[1:13:42] yourself
[1:13:49] [Applause]
[1:13:52] but don't you know he made mistakes here
[1:13:54] and there and here and there here and
[1:13:56] there why don't you turn that on your
[1:13:58] denominational preacher
[1:14:00] why don't you turn that on the leaders
[1:14:02] of the world
[1:14:03] [Applause]
[1:14:08] god had an intention to send this
[1:14:10] message to gather his attributes to
[1:14:14] prepare them for resurrection to prepare
[1:14:17] them for rapture
[1:14:19] to overcome this layout of sea and age
[1:14:22] listen not just to come not just to
[1:14:25] survive not just to walk through it but
[1:14:28] to overcome it
[1:14:34] [Applause]
[1:14:47] in many places
[1:14:49] brother branham would compare it to like
[1:14:51] a railroad boxcar we've got people here
[1:14:54] brother denny actually brought me a seal
[1:14:56] i hope that was
[1:14:57] okay
[1:15:00] it's a seal i used to use those seals
[1:15:02] when i was
[1:15:03] working at a certain spot
[1:15:06] and
[1:15:08] and he said
[1:15:09] he said after it's all packed in that
[1:15:11] box car
[1:15:13] he said it and they closed that door and
[1:15:15] put the seal on it it's sealed
[1:15:18] for its destination
[1:15:22] and the railroad companies would put you
[1:15:24] in the penitentiary for a lifetime if
[1:15:26] you break that seal
[1:15:28] it cannot be broken
[1:15:30] it's sealed to its destination we are
[1:15:33] going to be sealed to our destination
[1:15:37] and he said
[1:15:39] not just everybody on the track can just
[1:15:41] open it up and look at it and examine
[1:15:43] and looking over and throw things in or
[1:15:45] out
[1:15:47] you can't do that no sir
[1:15:49] no sir
[1:15:51] he said now another place he said that
[1:15:54] inspector he came through and he he
[1:15:56] shook it
[1:15:57] and he went through and if he could see
[1:15:59] anything that was loose
[1:16:01] now i'm preaching to you
[1:16:04] if there's anything loose he would
[1:16:06] condemn it
[1:16:09] that's what's the matter that's what the
[1:16:11] matter with the inspector is going
[1:16:12] tonight
[1:16:14] it's going by our light of our lives
[1:16:16] and the reason we don't get the holy
[1:16:18] ghost we might carry on and act like
[1:16:21] we've got it
[1:16:24] but the fruits
[1:16:26] by your fruits you're known
[1:16:30] that's how you're known
[1:16:32] and he shakes it
[1:16:34] to find out that there's any loose
[1:16:36] places of
[1:16:37] unbelief
[1:16:40] a little loose place over here a loose
[1:16:43] place over here and he condemns it and
[1:16:45] sets it back again it's got to be packed
[1:16:49] right
[1:16:51] now like that sermon last night
[1:16:54] i'm not just saying this because andrew
[1:16:56] preached it my son
[1:16:58] but i thought it was priest in the right
[1:17:00] attitude
[1:17:02] not down to you or
[1:17:04] not being overbearing but it was a great
[1:17:07] sermon
[1:17:13] this is our opportunity to get things
[1:17:16] right
[1:17:17] not after we die
[1:17:23] and i don't care
[1:17:24] i don't care if your last name's branham
[1:17:27] no disrespect there but you got to be
[1:17:30] born again
[1:17:33] you're going to face god
[1:17:37] and i don't want to face an angry god
[1:17:54] that boxcar has got to go over some
[1:17:55] rough roads
[1:17:58] when you become a christian
[1:18:00] there's some some really tough things
[1:18:02] that you're going to have to go through
[1:18:13] there's some really tough things that
[1:18:14] you're going to go through
[1:18:16] if you don't have him
[1:18:20] there's going to be times on your road
[1:18:21] that you're going to feel like
[1:18:23] giving up
[1:18:31] i had a lot of texts sent to me this
[1:18:33] week
[1:18:36] but there was a text that was sent to me
[1:18:37] this week that said brother ron i'd some
[1:18:39] point i'd like to have a dinner with you
[1:18:41] he was he was away from here
[1:18:43] he said i'd like to have a dinner with
[1:18:45] you he said he said i'd rather have a
[1:18:47] dinner with you
[1:18:48] than any superstar athlete
[1:18:51] or the president
[1:18:53] he said because your life has been such
[1:18:55] an example
[1:18:56] of jesus christ
[1:19:04] i thought oh god help me
[1:19:08] help me that i never disappoint one
[1:19:10] person
[1:19:12] i pray that they can see jesus christ
[1:19:16] may that be your testimony today
[1:19:24] someone asked me are you going to preach
[1:19:26] this weekend i said yeah i'm going to
[1:19:27] tell the world i'm still alive
[1:19:32] [Applause]
[1:19:45] jesus turns to simon is it simon i
[1:19:47] prayed for you
[1:19:49] that thy faith fail thee not
[1:19:53] he said because satan hath desired to
[1:19:55] have you that he may sift you as wheat
[1:19:59] but i have prayed for thee that faith
[1:20:01] failed not
[1:20:02] and when thou art converted
[1:20:05] i want you to just notice simon had been
[1:20:07] one of the lead disciples
[1:20:10] and i want to say something here you
[1:20:11] could be one of the leaders in this
[1:20:13] church and if you don't have jesus
[1:20:16] satan's going to sift you like wheat
[1:20:19] he's going to flip your world upside
[1:20:21] down and no doubt you'll deny him thrice
[1:20:24] but jesus prayed for you
[1:20:27] and if you can ever come to a conversion
[1:20:32] if you can ever come to a conversion
[1:20:35] to work you quit arguing
[1:20:37] well i don't know where brother brandon
[1:20:39] was right or not or i i don't know if
[1:20:41] this church is right or not if you ever
[1:20:43] become convinced
[1:20:48] are you with me i'm going to preach to
[1:20:49] every one of you
[1:20:50] you ever become convinced
[1:20:54] this message has got rapture in it it's
[1:20:57] got resurrection in it
[1:21:00] it's got overcoming power in it
[1:21:04] it's got how to raise your family how to
[1:21:06] raise your children
[1:21:08] how to raise above the nightmares of
[1:21:11] life
[1:21:13] it's got the sealing power inside of you
[1:21:20] satan's tried every scheme that he can
[1:21:22] to destroy it
[1:21:24] he's tried every rumor that he can to
[1:21:26] destroy he'll do that to you too
[1:21:29] but there's a seal of the keeping power
[1:21:32] on the inside of you
[1:21:35] where god seals you for your journey
[1:21:40] not just from camp meeting to camp
[1:21:42] meetings or trial to try help me preach
[1:21:48] but for your journey i'm not here just
[1:21:51] for tomorrow i'm not here just for next
[1:21:54] week i'm here to the rapture
[1:21:57] [Applause]
[1:22:12] and as for me and my house we're going
[1:22:14] to serve the lord
[1:22:16] i am committed
[1:22:19] i'm not turning back
[1:22:22] i'll never never never never go back
[1:22:25] there's nothing to go back to
[1:22:30] [Applause]
[1:22:46] it's a powerful scripture and it's only
[1:22:48] just a few words
[1:22:49] remember lot's wife
[1:22:56] i've preached a lot of conventions in my
[1:22:58] life
[1:23:00] i trust i've had an impact
[1:23:04] i really do this stage in my journey i
[1:23:07] trust i've had an impact
[1:23:09] i trust i will continue to have an
[1:23:10] impact
[1:23:17] but now i want you to hear these words
[1:23:19] and i want you to hear them real clear
[1:23:22] i want the internet to hear this clear
[1:23:26] do we want to stop and think
[1:23:28] about the tragedy
[1:23:30] of being left behind
[1:23:47] do we want to stop and think about the
[1:23:49] tragedy of being left behind
[1:23:55] things that we couldn't let go
[1:23:59] weights that bound us to the world
[1:24:04] jesus told he gave a sermon about
[1:24:07] excuses
[1:24:09] i don't want to fulfill that part
[1:24:13] i don't mind being part of that
[1:24:15] compelled to come
[1:24:17] unqualified
[1:24:19] horrible past of life but yet god rich
[1:24:22] in mercy reach down and grab the hold of
[1:24:24] me and i could be an inspiration stand
[1:24:27] with this message
[1:24:28] but i don't want to be a part of those
[1:24:31] that bought land or bought oxen or
[1:24:34] married somebody
[1:24:41] i don't want an excuse
[1:24:45] how many people have excuses about just
[1:24:48] not coming to church
[1:24:50] oh brother ron i believe that
[1:24:52] really
[1:24:55] really i believe what you're preaching
[1:24:56] i've been watching it on the internet
[1:24:58] i believe what you're preaching one of
[1:25:00] these days i'm going to get in church
[1:25:03] really
[1:25:13] it's one thing to tell me your excuses
[1:25:18] and it's another thing to come when this
[1:25:21] building is empty
[1:25:27] buildings all across the message are
[1:25:29] empty
[1:25:31] and there's no generals
[1:25:34] to preach to you
[1:25:36] because god confirmed his word
[1:25:41] i'm screaming like noah out the door of
[1:25:44] the ark
[1:25:48] i cannot imagine the compassion as
[1:25:51] noah's watching the animals come he
[1:25:53] didn't make that happen
[1:25:56] he didn't have the ability to make that
[1:25:58] happen
[1:26:01] only god can make two of every kind
[1:26:06] gather themselves to the ark he he just
[1:26:09] did his work and he preached every day
[1:26:12] he did his work and he preached every
[1:26:14] day 120 years
[1:26:17] that's what i've been doing here for
[1:26:18] about 22 years
[1:26:21] i've been standing faithful in this
[1:26:23] pulpit
[1:26:26] [Applause]
[1:26:35] i preach with this same kind of passion
[1:26:37] since 1984. let me just say this to you
[1:26:40] but there will come a time
[1:26:43] when our lips will be closed
[1:26:48] noah did all he could
[1:26:51] noah did at all
[1:26:53] listen we cannot
[1:26:56] in our frame of humanity
[1:26:59] produce a body change
[1:27:01] but we can believe a message with
[1:27:04] everything that's within us
[1:27:08] and let that message
[1:27:11] you eat the book
[1:27:14] you eat christ
[1:27:20] what does that mean
[1:27:22] you hear people in their conversation
[1:27:23] they're so politically charged
[1:27:26] because they're eating fox news or cnn
[1:27:29] they're reading their books let me just
[1:27:32] tell you about political books they're
[1:27:34] full of demons
[1:27:36] they'll still be going on in the
[1:27:38] tribulation period
[1:27:40] and they won't even know that the
[1:27:42] rapture took place
[1:27:48] denominations will still be having their
[1:27:50] churches
[1:27:53] they'll be moving right on
[1:27:55] saying how bad the world is how bad
[1:27:57] abortion is
[1:27:58] how bad the gas rates are how bad russia
[1:28:02] is how bad all of these things are and
[1:28:04] they've slipped right into the
[1:28:05] tribulation period because somewhere
[1:28:08] they made a choice
[1:28:10] we're not going to listen and we're
[1:28:11] going to crucify that message that has
[1:28:15] come
[1:28:16] because it discredited our our
[1:28:19] denomination and our preachers
[1:28:25] and our creeds and our dogmas
[1:28:31] you know sometimes i know
[1:28:33] the preacher comes down your alley and
[1:28:36] all of a sudden calls you out it's then
[1:28:38] that you can repent or it's then you can
[1:28:40] hold on to it and get mad and get an
[1:28:42] attitude
[1:28:50] i don't have it in front of me this
[1:28:51] moment but
[1:28:53] it was an angel of god that nudged the
[1:28:56] prodigal son to go home
[1:28:59] that's what brother brahm said
[1:29:02] nudged him to go home
[1:29:05] it wasn't you that got yourself in
[1:29:06] church
[1:29:12] matt
