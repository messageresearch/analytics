[0:16] 11th chapter of hebrews which gives the
[0:18] heroes of faith by
[0:20] faith moses by faith abraham bob faith
[0:23] enoch by faith
[0:24] noah all the great heroes of faith and
[0:27] saying seeing that we are compassed
[0:29] about with such a great cloud of
[0:31] witnesses
[0:31] let us lay aside every weight and the
[0:33] sin the unbelief
[0:35] that does so easily beset us here we are
[0:38] tonight
[0:38] right in the shadows of the coming of
[0:41] the son of god
[0:42] and yet we find the church in anemic
[0:45] condition
[0:46] we ought to be great strong mighty
[0:48] warriors of faith that would
[0:50] shake a nation god gives it to us
[0:54] we would just receive it so these old
[0:57] things upon us
[0:58] that hold us back from running let's lay
[1:01] aside all those little weights down
[1:03] because we're looking to the author and
[1:05] finisher of our faith jesus christ
[1:07] who was made man on earth and dwelt
[1:10] among us and has made
[1:12] sin that through his righteousness we
[1:14] might be forgiven of our sins
[1:17] he became us sinners that we might
[1:19] become his righteousness
[1:21] in other words like this he become me
[1:23] that i might become him
[1:24] he was the son of god i was a sinner he
[1:26] taken my praise become a sinner i might
[1:28] be a son of god
[1:30] and when we see that in order to attract
[1:32] the attention of every man and woman to
[1:33] lay aside everyone's skeptic talks
[1:37] oh i love that they'll
[1:43] some little something come up that we
[1:44] said well i never heard of that before
[1:46] search it out in the scripture
[1:47] if it's a bible stay with it
[1:50] you people you're noted for your great
[1:53] delicious apples raised in the valley
[1:55] here and
[1:56] other fruits when you set that little
[1:57] tree out a little larger than that just
[1:59] a little slip
[2:00] every apple is able to be in that trees
[2:02] in it right there
[2:04] so it is if it doesn't where does it
[2:05] come from it's in the tree
[2:08] and you plant the tree in the ground you
[2:10] irrigate it put water on it
[2:12] what does that little tree do it grows
[2:14] and why
[2:15] it grows it drinks and draws from the
[2:17] earth water
[2:19] it draws more than its potion more than
[2:22] enough to fill it
[2:23] it draws it so much until it pushes out
[2:25] limbs branches
[2:26] apples then goes down and hides through
[2:29] the winter time
[2:30] keeps the sap from being killed in the
[2:32] tree what intelligence runs it down into
[2:34] the ground
[2:35] hides it through the winter put a water
[2:37] in a tan cup and set it on the fence and
[2:38] see if it'll go down
[2:40] when winter time comes certainly it
[2:42] won't some intelligence runs it down
[2:45] that same intelligence that runs the
[2:46] water in there is the same spirit of god
[2:49] has got us together
[2:50] for this convention the same spirit
[2:53] that's bringing us together here under
[2:54] the heavenly places in christ jesus
[2:57] to find his goodness and mercy for the
[2:59] hours that lays ahead of
[3:03] real us is now we find
[3:06] that in this little tree it pushes out
[3:09] when it grows it pushes out
[3:11] and when you are born into the kingdom
[3:14] of god just a little baby in christ
[3:17] everything that you have needed in this
[3:20] life's journey is in you
[3:21] when you receive the holy spirit
[3:24] oh then what you have to do is drink and
[3:27] drink and keep on drinking don't you
[3:31] stop when you join church and are
[3:32] baptized
[3:33] just keep drinking until you have faith
[3:35] for this and faith for that and
[3:37] faith for this and push out until all
[3:40] the manifestations of the holy spirit is
[3:42] living in the church

[1:01:21] amen when you have it this evening amen
[1:01:26] let not sin therefore reign in your
[1:01:28] mortal body that you should obey it in
[1:01:30] the lust thereof
[1:01:32] neither yield ye your members as
[1:01:34] instruments of unrighteousness unto sin
[1:01:37] but yield yourselves unto god
[1:01:40] as those that are alive from the dead
[1:01:42] and your members as
[1:01:43] instruments of righteousness unto god
[1:01:47] for sin shall not have dominion over you
[1:01:50] for ye are not under the law but unto
[1:01:52] grace
[1:01:53] what then shall we sin because we are
[1:01:56] not under the law but under grace god
[1:01:58] forbid
[1:01:59] know ye not that to whom you yield
[1:02:01] yourselves servants to obey
[1:02:04] his servants are ye to whom you obey
[1:02:07] whether of sin
[1:02:08] unto death or of obedience unto
[1:02:10] righteousness
[1:02:11] but god be thanked that ye were the
[1:02:13] servants of sin but ye have obeyed from
[1:02:15] the heart that form of doctrine
[1:02:18] which was delivered you being then made
[1:02:21] free from sin ye became the servants
[1:02:24] of righteousness god bless his word he
[1:02:27] may be seated
[1:02:28] tonight in the presence of the lord i'd
[1:02:31] like to take from these scriptures a
[1:02:33] thought
[1:02:35] on taken taken over
[1:02:38] and if you go to looking at that word
[1:02:40] taken it means to be received it means
[1:02:43] to
[1:02:43] it means to be caught taken it means to
[1:02:46] be
[1:02:46] apprehended and captivated and you can
[1:02:49] look at those words and synonyms of that
[1:02:52] word taken it means to be
[1:02:53] it means to be captivated it means to be
[1:02:56] possessed or controlled or empowered by
[1:02:59] when someone has taken over
[1:03:01] they're taken over by maybe we would say
[1:03:04] maybe as christians or
[1:03:05] people that we're affiliated with we
[1:03:07] would say that that person is
[1:03:09] is empowered or taken over by the holy
[1:03:11] spirit
[1:03:12] and that person is possessed and there's
[1:03:14] certain there's certain things that
[1:03:15] you've been around in your life and
[1:03:17] there's just certain people that you're
[1:03:18] acquainted with and
[1:03:20] that you just there's certain people
[1:03:21] that have an atmosphere about them
[1:03:23] that you just absolutely love to be
[1:03:25] around them you could
[1:03:26] you could be around them all day long
[1:03:28] and not be tired of then there's certain
[1:03:30] people that you couldn't be around them
[1:03:32] fi
[1:03:32] you don't want to be around them five
[1:03:33] minutes it's just something about them
[1:03:36] that's it's it's a spirit that they
[1:03:38] carry it's something that
[1:03:40] that makes the spirit of the living god
[1:03:42] that's living on the inside of you
[1:03:43] uneasy and it doesn't make you feel
[1:03:46] comfortable and
[1:03:47] and then there there there are people
[1:03:48] that carry spirits maybe carry a spirit
[1:03:51] of depression or
[1:03:52] or anxiety but then there's even going
[1:03:54] down into a deeper realm there's
[1:03:56] there is demon possession that that that
[1:03:59] takes over a person and
[1:04:01] and if you've ever been around somebody
[1:04:03] that's been demon possessed they
[1:04:04] that person it's not the person
[1:04:07] themselves that makes them do that
[1:04:09] it's that spirit that's that's dwelling
[1:04:11] there that's so controlling them and
[1:04:13] taking over their body that that they
[1:04:15] can't even they can't even control
[1:04:17] themselves
[1:04:18] but yet we can also look at it as as a
[1:04:22] as a holy possession and we can see that
[1:04:24] there is a people
[1:04:26] on earth and we're living in a day like
[1:04:28] we've never lived before
[1:04:29] where god is empowering a body that is
[1:04:32] that is so
[1:04:33] under the control of the holy ghost that
[1:04:35] he's taking over ownership in their life
[1:04:38] and and they are they're watching the
[1:04:41] god of the bible become the god of their
[1:04:43] heart
[1:04:44] and when the god of the bible becomes
[1:04:46] the god of your heart you will see that
[1:04:48] this message
[1:04:49] is vindicated and you'll see that this
[1:04:51] message is absolutely the truth
[1:04:53] when you get took over by the power of
[1:04:56] the living god and you can see that
[1:04:58] that that person is totally committed
[1:05:01] and
[1:05:02] and totally taken over by that spirit of
[1:05:04] god when you see somebody
[1:05:06] you just love to be around them when
[1:05:08] they've got that same atmosphere when
[1:05:10] you go to reading
[1:05:11] about jesus of the bible and you get to
[1:05:14] deal and maybe you get to hanging out
[1:05:15] with brother nathaniel or you get to
[1:05:17] hanging out with brother donny
[1:05:18] and you'll recognize that the same life
[1:05:21] that you read
[1:05:22] in the book of the bible when you look
[1:05:23] through the four gospels that you'll see
[1:05:26] that that same spirit is living on the
[1:05:28] inside of that person
[1:05:30] and you'll watch that they got the same
[1:05:31] mannerisms they've got the same
[1:05:33] characteristics they've got the same
[1:05:36] love that jesus had
[1:05:37] the same atmosphere that jesus had it
[1:05:40] makes you long to be in his spirit
[1:05:42] and really if you are not possessed with
[1:05:44] his spirit
[1:05:45] or fully taken over and baptized with
[1:05:48] the spirit
[1:05:49] it makes you long it makes you long to
[1:05:52] get that way
[1:05:54] if you ever been around if you ever been
[1:05:56] around somebody and you you've been
[1:05:58] around somebody you just you get so
[1:06:00] infatuated with a thought
[1:06:02] man i just love to be that way
[1:06:06] i just love to have that kind of
[1:06:07] atmosphere and you know i have to say it
[1:06:10] to you tonight maybe you're
[1:06:12] maybe you're thinking that but you can
[1:06:14] have that same spirit
[1:06:16] you can have that same token life of
[1:06:18] jesus christ
[1:06:20] and it can so embody you and take over
[1:06:22] your life
[1:06:26] we know that we're built to be the
[1:06:27] temple of god a place that
[1:06:29] that god wants to dwell out a place
[1:06:32] where god wants to come and
[1:06:33] dwell by his holy spirit but we know
[1:06:36] that by the fall of humanity
[1:06:38] that we were born in sin we were we were
[1:06:40] shaped in iniquity and we
[1:06:42] we come into this world and we said
[1:06:44] things that weren't right nobody had to
[1:06:45] teach your children how to lie
[1:06:49] none of you parents stood out and made
[1:06:51] made a point in your life to teach your
[1:06:52] children how to tell a little fib
[1:06:54] but yet something on the inside of them
[1:06:56] wants to deny that they took that cookie
[1:06:59] out of the cookie jar
[1:07:00] you see it but it's it's what they were
[1:07:02] born under we were born in sin
[1:07:05] we were shaped in iniquity and and here
[1:07:08] we are because of our first birth we
[1:07:10] carry these characteristics
[1:07:12] but there can be a change in all of that
[1:07:15] there can be a change and maybe you were
[1:07:17] born in this world and
[1:07:19] you came into this world and you spoke
[1:07:20] lies and you've done awful deeds and you
[1:07:23] and you run around and you did all kinds
[1:07:24] of ungodly things
[1:07:26] but i want to say this loud and clear
[1:07:29] you never
[1:07:29] were the devil's property you may have
[1:07:33] done
[1:07:33] things wrong you may have said things
[1:07:35] wrong you may have acted wrong
[1:07:37] you may even went out and drunk
[1:07:39] something that was wrong but you were
[1:07:41] never the devil's
[1:07:42] property he never had a claim on you he
[1:07:45] never will have a claim on you
[1:07:47] you see before the foundation of the
[1:07:49] world you were already
[1:07:50] in god's mind and if you were in god's
[1:07:52] mind you could never be the devil's
[1:07:54] property
[1:07:55] you may have acted like a devil you may
[1:07:57] sometimes even look like a devil but you
[1:08:00] never were a devil
[1:08:02] if you are a daughter of god if you are
[1:08:04] a son of god
[1:08:05] you were never a twofold child of hell
[1:08:08] you were already a son of god
[1:08:10] you just didn't realize it yet
[1:08:15] but you remember the day that all of a
[1:08:18] sudden something happened to you
[1:08:20] that all of a sudden there became that
[1:08:22] first birth began to just shed way
[1:08:25] and you begin to morph into the person
[1:08:28] that god called you to be
[1:08:30] and it was like god deposited something
[1:08:32] on the inside of you
[1:08:34] you couldn't make it up you couldn't
[1:08:36] make yourself live right
[1:08:37] you couldn't make yourself dance you
[1:08:39] couldn't make yourself get emotional
[1:08:41] about religious things but something was
[1:08:44] deposited on the inside of you
[1:08:48] and you just walked into it you just
[1:08:52] stepped right into that realm because
[1:08:54] you were born for that realm
[1:08:58] are you with me you see the title deed
[1:09:02] to the earth and to eternal life when
[1:09:04] when adam forfeited it then satan's
[1:09:07] dirty hands could not take it
[1:09:09] so it went back to the original owner
[1:09:11] god himself
[1:09:13] so when satan wanted to put his clamps
[1:09:16] on your life
[1:09:17] mercy said no when satan was doing his
[1:09:21] absolute best
[1:09:23] to call you his and claim you as his and
[1:09:26] claim this earth
[1:09:27] and claim the possession of god almighty
[1:09:29] god said
[1:09:30] there's not a chance that i'm gonna let
[1:09:33] you lay your hands on my children
[1:09:36] you are so important that all the way
[1:09:39] back in the garden of heath
[1:09:40] god had already seen a lamb dying for
[1:09:43] you
[1:09:44] and though satan didn't have the vision
[1:09:46] real clear but
[1:09:48] two thousand four thousand years later
[1:09:50] there came a man
[1:09:52] that walked on the shores of galilee and
[1:09:54] john the baptist said
[1:09:55] behold the lamb of god that takes away
[1:09:58] the sins of the world
[1:10:01] satan was getting a vision of what was
[1:10:04] coming to pass
[1:10:05] what god was talking about back there in
[1:10:08] the beginning
[1:10:13] this is the seat of the woman
[1:10:19] you see the fallen condition of humanity
[1:10:24] had to be rightfully restored
[1:10:27] we all enjoy we all enjoy watching as
[1:10:32] as older cars come into full restoration
[1:10:37] there's nothing like seeing a 67
[1:10:41] and a 69 camaro that's been all rusted
[1:10:45] up and set in a garage somewhere
[1:10:47] and nobody's put no put no love on it
[1:10:50] but all of a sudden somebody
[1:10:52] decides they want to put a little tlc on
[1:10:54] that thing
[1:10:55] and they want to build that thing back
[1:10:57] to its originality and
[1:10:59] they're grabbing parts from here and
[1:11:00] they're grabbing parts from there
[1:11:02] and it's all got to be original you see
[1:11:05] what they're doing is they're restoring
[1:11:07] that car
[1:11:08] back to its first estate and they're
[1:11:11] wanting it to look just like it did
[1:11:13] in the beginning and just maybe maybe
[1:11:15] you've read stories about
[1:11:17] about coins that had been lost in the
[1:11:19] sea and they had been
[1:11:21] they've been under salt water for so
[1:11:22] many years and they and they change
[1:11:24] it change their characteristics it had
[1:11:26] rusted it up and it made it it made it
[1:11:29] look like it
[1:11:30] made it even look like it wasn't even
[1:11:31] valuable but
[1:11:33] somebody that is called or deemed a
[1:11:36] restorer
[1:11:37] takes that valuable coin and they start
[1:11:40] putting it through a restoration process
[1:11:43] and they start bringing out the beauty
[1:11:45] of it
[1:11:46] now maybe in your condition or looking
[1:11:48] at its first estate
[1:11:50] you wouldn't have gave a nickel for it
[1:11:52] but when it went through the restoration
[1:11:54] process
[1:11:55] then it's worth millions of dollars you
[1:11:58] see at a point in your life
[1:12:00] you didn't look like your life was worth
[1:12:02] a nickel
[1:12:03] but then when you come to the other side
[1:12:06] of things
[1:12:06] you found out that you was worth 10
[1:12:08] million worlds
[1:12:10] you see somebody was willing to be
[1:12:13] deemed the restoration
[1:12:15] of a broad tree and put her right back
[1:12:18] in her order again
[1:12:20] and finally we are seeing that the fruit
[1:12:23] is at the top of the tree again
[1:12:25] and the same life that was put in the
[1:12:28] first tree
[1:12:29] is now in the bride tree
[1:12:33] you see the restore is to bring it back
[1:12:35] to who it really owns it
[1:12:37] or to bring it back to its natural state
[1:12:39] where was it the first time to bring it
[1:12:41] back to its natural condition
[1:12:43] but in order to do this we have a right
[1:12:45] to enforce if there's a law to enforce
[1:12:48] this rightful condition of restoration
[1:12:50] to restore
[1:12:51] like if somebody stole some property or
[1:12:54] they're holding the property captive
[1:12:56] then you can take the law and go to this
[1:12:58] person and the law enforces it
[1:13:01] this person to restore the property back
[1:13:04] to its natural owner
[1:13:05] and back to its first estate you see you
[1:13:09] always were
[1:13:10] his children i don't want you to hear me
[1:13:14] he's always had you in his hands
[1:13:19] he's always had you in his hands and
[1:13:22] maybe you haven't recognized what is
[1:13:24] going on right here but redemption is at
[1:13:26] work
[1:13:27] and god is saying i brought you back for
[1:13:29] this i bought you for this purpose
[1:13:32] i redeemed you because you're of value
[1:13:34] to me you see if you were not no value
[1:13:37] of god you'd never be sitting here
[1:13:39] if you were not no value to to him he
[1:13:42] would have never spent his life for you
[1:13:44] but what did he do he redeemed you he
[1:13:47] brought you back he redeemed your soul
[1:13:49] from hell
[1:13:50] he redeemed and brought back everything
[1:13:52] that adam lost when he satan
[1:13:55] put you in the pawn shop and jesus
[1:13:57] christ on calvary
[1:13:58] was your kinsman redeemer that redeemed
[1:14:00] you from every curse of the devil
[1:14:03] he redeemed your soul he redeemed your
[1:14:05] sick body
[1:14:06] he redeems your weary and dreary spirit
[1:14:09] he brought you happiness somebody said
[1:14:11] he brought me happiness
[1:14:13] he brought you joy that's what
[1:14:15] redemption brought you
[1:14:17] he brought you peace he brought you
[1:14:20] longsuffering
[1:14:22] he brought you goodness that's what
[1:14:24] jesus brought you
[1:14:26] he brought you goodness he brought you
[1:14:28] gentleness
[1:14:29] he brought you meekness he brought you
[1:14:32] the holy spirit
[1:14:33] he brought you divine healing all these
[1:14:36] things jesus christ brought you
[1:14:38] because he was our kinsmen redeemer
[1:14:42] and people walk around with their head
[1:14:45] hung down in the mud
[1:14:47] and when you look at somebody like that
[1:14:49] you can see where they've had their head
[1:14:51] because their head is full of dirt
[1:14:55] but if you could just lift your head
[1:14:57] just for a moment brother andrew wants
[1:14:59] to tell you
[1:15:00] he brought you joy he brought you peace
[1:15:03] he brought you happiness he brought you
[1:15:05] divine healing
[1:15:06] he brought you miracles
[1:15:10] hallelujah he brought you to this spot
[1:15:13] because he thought that you were worth
[1:15:16] his own life

[1:15:22] think it's miserable
[1:15:24] you can think it's your you can look at
[1:15:25] your life and think it's worth throwing

[1:21:47] hallelujah what happened to you you were
[1:21:51] taken over
[1:21:59] when the queen of sheba when she began
[1:22:02] to hear the fame of solomon
[1:22:04] something began to take over her she
[1:22:07] began to hear about the name of the lord
[1:22:10] and how god was doing these miraculous
[1:22:12] things through his servant solomon
[1:22:14] and she went hundreds of miles
[1:22:18] just because of a story
[1:22:21] just because of what somebody was saying
[1:22:24] just because of what
[1:22:25] what they were saying about solomon that
[1:22:27] he knows all the secrets of the heart
[1:22:29] that god has given him a wisdom
[1:22:32] and she packs up her train and she takes
[1:22:35] off
[1:22:37] she's making this journey for miles and
[1:22:39] miles
[1:22:40] what's going on here she is taken over
[1:22:44] by the thought that there's a man that
[1:22:46] can answer the secrets of my heart
[1:22:54] when you're looking for answers
[1:22:57] had a list of answers in your pocket had
[1:23:01] them right there in your heart and you

[1:23:23] way out to there
[1:23:25] and she's carrying merge she's carrying
[1:23:27] spices she's carrying gold and she's
[1:23:29] carrying silver
[1:23:30] but she's not concerned with the thought
[1:23:34] of ishmael's sons running out there and
[1:23:37] trying to kill her
[1:23:38] she is totally captivated with the
[1:23:40] thought that there is a man that can
[1:23:43] tell me the secrets of my heart
[1:23:45] she had all of these goods all of these
[1:23:47] treasures but she was so
[1:23:49] she was under the influence of something
[1:23:51] she was so taken over
[1:23:53] that i've got to get there
[1:23:57] she didn't let the thought of robbers
[1:23:59] come in to stop her
[1:24:01] she rode out there on camels she didn't
[1:24:04] ride out there in a nice cadillac
[1:24:06] she rode out there because something was
[1:24:09] taking over her thought
[1:24:13] she didn't know if she'd walk away with
[1:24:14] them she didn't know but she was willing
[1:24:16] to go all the way
[1:24:17] she was willing to go all the miles just
[1:24:19] to get close to him
[1:24:21] just to get there and if you could
[1:24:22] imagine tonight if something that same
[1:24:25] something would get a hold of you
[1:24:29] well i came all the way from grotto's
[1:24:31] all right i came all the way from
[1:24:32] lexington
[1:24:33] i came all the way from over the
[1:24:35] mountain if you'd come with the same
[1:24:37] something that was leading the queen of
[1:24:40] the south
[1:24:40] all the way through those miles you
[1:24:42] would walk away
[1:24:44] from here tonight with a different
[1:24:47] outlook
[1:24:48] that there is a fame of the lord jesus
[1:24:50] christ down there at full gospel
[1:24:52] lighthouse
[1:24:54] it's more than just on the stream and
[1:24:56] it's more than just what people
[1:24:58] have posted on facebook there's a living
[1:25:00] god down there
[1:25:01] [Applause]
[1:25:03] oh hallelujah
[1:25:05] [Applause]
[1:25:07] you could come in here in a wheelchair
[1:25:09] you could come in here sick
[1:25:10] you could come in here and die straights
[1:25:13] but there's a man
[1:25:14] here that can tell you the very secrets
[1:25:18] of his heart
[1:25:19] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:25:21] forever he's not changing
[1:25:23] and he won't change he'll tell you if
[1:25:25] the doctrine's right
[1:25:28] he'll tell you if your dress is right
[1:25:30] he'll tell if your mind is right
[1:25:32] he'll tell you what spirit you're of if
[1:25:35] that
[1:25:36] something could get a hold of you
[1:25:42] you can't do it until he gets a hold of
[1:25:44] you
[1:25:47] the devil would like to implant in your
[1:25:48] mind that you were his and you always
[1:25:51] were his and he's got claims on you
[1:25:53] that's a lie that came straight from the
[1:25:55] pits of hell
[1:25:57] you can leave him you can leave that lie
[1:25:59] right there where hell where it came
[1:26:01] from
[1:26:02] you were not a twofold child of hell
[1:26:04] because the bible says
[1:26:06] that as many as are led by the spirit
[1:26:08] they are the sons of god
[1:26:10] for you've not received the spirit of
[1:26:12] bondage again of fear but you receive
[1:26:14] the spirit of adoption
[1:26:15] whereby we cry of a father the spirit
[1:26:18] itself
[1:26:18] itself bears witness with our spirit
[1:26:20] that we are the children of god
[1:26:23] and if children than heirs heirs of god
[1:26:26] and join us with christ
[1:26:27] if so be that we suffer with him that
[1:26:29] may we be also glorified together
[1:26:33] you see if your heart and your mind is
[1:26:35] so enfilled with god's spirit until your
[1:26:38] thoughts become his thoughts
[1:26:39] there you are when your mind and your
[1:26:41] leading and your guiding becomes a
[1:26:43] direct place
[1:26:44] or a direct inspiration of the holy
[1:26:46] spirit that's moving your mortal being
[1:26:48] what kind of people should we be
[1:26:52] if the very holy spirit has you so
[1:26:54] embodied or empowered that you don't use
[1:26:57] your own thoughts
[1:26:58] that you don't use your own mind you
[1:27:00] don't use your own opinion
[1:27:01] but the holy spirit has you so built
[1:27:04] until your thoughts
[1:27:05] and your being is god's spirit
[1:27:07] expressing itself through you
[1:27:09] what kind of church would we be
[1:27:15] when's the last time you let yourself
[1:27:17] get good and took over by the holy ghost
[1:27:22] come on somebody when's the last time
[1:27:24] when you got yourself
[1:27:26] so far into the worship that you lost
[1:27:28] sight to everything that you walked in
[1:27:31] with
[1:27:32] but you begin to break out in worship
[1:27:35] when the piano wasn't going
[1:27:37] and the organ wasn't humming out and the
[1:27:39] song leader wasn't even singing but you
[1:27:41] were in a realm of worship
[1:27:45] oh and you broke into a worship and
[1:27:47] there was nobody else singing
[1:27:49] maybe somebody else around you they were
[1:27:52] looking around
[1:27:53] looking and see if little johnny was
[1:27:55] here or little susie was here
[1:27:57] but you were so caught up in worship
[1:28:01] that you didn't care who was here and
[1:28:03] you didn't care who wasn't here
[1:28:05] but you were caught up in the worship
[1:28:07] you were taken over by a worship
[1:28:10] when's the last time that you've turned
[1:28:11] your face towards his holy hill
[1:28:14] and you started worshiping when's the
[1:28:17] last time you got good and took over and
[1:28:19] you got good and drunk on the holy ghost
[1:28:22] what kind of people would we be if we
[1:28:24] turn ourselves loose to this kind of
[1:28:27] that turn ourselves loose to this kind
[1:28:29] of worship
[1:28:30] what kind of church would full gospel
[1:28:32] lighthouse be
[1:28:35] if we went far enough into our worship
[1:28:38] far enough into our prayer
[1:28:39] fire enough into our praise you say well
[1:28:42] i'm afraid that a little fire might
[1:28:44] break out or a little wildfire would
[1:28:46] break out
[1:28:47] and somebody may not really get it but
[1:28:49] somebody else might and i don't know

[1:34:11] on the inside of this word
[1:34:13] you wouldn't be worried about what
[1:34:14] everything else is around you you'd be
[1:34:16] wrapped up tied up tangled up in jesus
[1:34:20] you'd be so enveloped in the word of
[1:34:22] almighty god
[1:34:23] that you would know that you ain't gonna
[1:34:25] fall out
[1:34:29] oh hallelujah

[1:34:35] place tonight some gonna break loose in
[1:34:38] this place tonight
[1:34:39] because somebody is willing to push past
[1:34:46] you're willing to push past your own
[1:34:47] emotions for a moment
[1:34:51] you see there's a little something that
[1:34:53] every preacher deals with
[1:34:56] they got their own little things he
[1:34:59] maybe we would even
[1:35:00] call it a complex
[1:35:03] if that preacher could get past himself
[1:35:10] because every whether you know this or
[1:35:12] not some of them you may not
[1:35:16] i hate hearing the sound of my voice
[1:35:19] i hate i hate how loud i get
[1:35:25] i hate how i move
[1:35:29] i wish i could stand still no i don't
[1:35:30] really don't but i wish
[1:35:34] i wish that i wouldn't flop my hands
[1:35:36] everywhere
[1:35:38] you see and those are personal things
[1:35:42] that i battle and i'm telling you
[1:35:43] something and i've never told anybody
[1:35:46] else
[1:35:47] because i'm trying to get you to
[1:35:48] something
[1:35:50] because i realize that if i can push
[1:35:52] past myself
[1:35:57] and i can get so took over by the holy
[1:35:59] ghost
[1:36:00] there's something here i want you to
[1:36:02] notice that i
[1:36:04] can never do this without him
[1:36:08] i cannot preach without him i cannot
[1:36:11] talk without him
[1:36:12] i cannot live right without him there
[1:36:15] was a preacher one time that said i can
[1:36:18] do without the anointing for a while
[1:36:20] but every once in a while i need it i
[1:36:22] can't walk across the street without him
[1:36:26] but if i can get to a point where i can
[1:36:29] get so anointed
[1:36:30] and so took over i don't care how loud i
[1:36:33] preach
[1:36:33] i don't care how i flop my hands i don't
[1:36:35] care what my voice says
[1:36:37] what it sounds like let me squeak let me
[1:36:39] holler
[1:36:40] but if jesus comes through
[1:36:43] let me push past my own self
[1:36:48] if i can push past myself maybe somebody
[1:36:52] will get so loose and so drunk on the
[1:36:55] holy ghost
[1:36:56] that they'll break loose in worship
