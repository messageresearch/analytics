[59:04] passed by
[59:06] the token has taken care of us
[59:08] and we're like enoch we're getting ready
[59:10] to take some steps right into a rapture

[59:22] a man and a man amen so every service
[59:26] may be our last we don't know but i want
[59:28] to put a notice in
[59:31] when after the rapture takes place we're
[59:33] not going to be having service here
[59:36] they can do what they want to with the
[59:37] building foolish virgins can use it if
[59:39] they want to
[59:41] and i i but i want you to understand
[59:43] that we're going home
[59:46] this is what we've been preaching for
[59:48] this is what we've been living for
[59:50] amen so just step up a little higher
[59:54] amen god bless you
[59:56] amen first corinthians chapter 3 and
[59:59] verse eight
[1:00:02] first john chapter three and verse eight
[1:00:04] amen
[1:00:06] i hit a button a little while ago and
[1:00:07] lost all my notes so here we are
[1:00:10] amen
[1:00:11] first john chapter 3 and verse 8 he that
[1:00:15] committeth sin
[1:00:17] is of the devil
[1:00:18] for the devil sinneth from the beginning
[1:00:22] for this purpose
[1:00:25] the son of god was
[1:00:26] manifested that he might destroy the
[1:00:30] works of the devil
[1:00:33] and whosoever is born of god doth not
[1:00:36] commit sin
[1:00:37] for his seed remaineth in him and he
[1:00:40] cannot sin because he is born of god
[1:00:44] in this the children of god are
[1:00:46] manifested
[1:00:48] and the children of the devil
[1:00:50] whosoever death not righteousness is not
[1:00:53] of god
[1:00:55] neither he that loveth not his brother
[1:01:00] second corinthians chapter 4 and verse
[1:01:02] 8.
[1:01:06] we are troubled on every side
[1:01:10] i love this verse
[1:01:11] yet not distressed
[1:01:14] we are perplexed
[1:01:16] but not in despair
[1:01:18] we're persecuted but not forsaken
[1:01:22] cast down but not destroyed
[1:01:24] always bearing about in the body the
[1:01:27] dying of the lord jesus
[1:01:29] that the life also of jesus might be
[1:01:32] manifested
[1:01:33] in our body
[1:01:35] for we which live are always delivered
[1:01:38] unto death for jesus sake that the life
[1:01:41] also of jesus might be manifest in our
[1:01:43] mortal flesh
[1:01:45] so then that's working within us
[1:01:47] but life in you
[1:01:49] we have in the same spirit of faith
[1:01:53] according as it is written
[1:01:56] i believed

[1:04:16] nothing shall be impossible

[1:05:00] cancer can never touch your body ever
[1:05:03] again
[1:05:05] [Applause]
[1:05:08] but the man says one day when adam's
[1:05:10] race was backed into a corner the law
[1:05:12] had failed
[1:05:14] the prophets had failed the judges had
[1:05:16] failed and everything that god sent to
[1:05:18] the earth had failed
[1:05:20] and adam's race stood defeated
[1:05:25] sickness
[1:05:26] among them death among them everything
[1:05:30] death horrors in every place nothing
[1:05:32] could be done
[1:05:34] but in heaven there was one that stepped
[1:05:36] out the son of god and he said this day
[1:05:39] i will give my life for adam's race
[1:05:45] what will you do cried the angels what
[1:05:47] will you do and he came to earth and he
[1:05:50] looked upon a bunch of men and women and
[1:05:52] and and that wanted to serve the lord
[1:05:55] they couldn't
[1:05:56] there was so much temptation
[1:05:59] so much sin so much sickness so much
[1:06:01] troubles on every hand they just
[1:06:03] couldn't
[1:06:04] everything had failed it looked like
[1:06:06] till
[1:06:07] he found the darkest spot of man's fear
[1:06:10] that was death
[1:06:12] it's always been
[1:06:14] and he ran in right to calvary
[1:06:17] to the thickest of the spears and throw
[1:06:20] them into his heart and cry back take
[1:06:23] what i leave you the baptism of the holy
[1:06:26] ghost and fight as you can
[1:06:31] brother i mean if there ever was a time
[1:06:33] when those disciples picked up the
[1:06:35] baptism of the holy ghost one of the
[1:06:37] mightiest weapons that's ever been given
[1:06:39] to the hands of men and they cut a hole
[1:06:42] today through sin and they defeated the
[1:06:45] devil
[1:06:47] and running him back to sickness and all
[1:06:49] of these things
[1:06:50] men wants to see heroism
[1:06:53] men are waiting for a gallant stand the
[1:06:56] world's waiting to find a man who can
[1:07:00] step out
[1:07:02] i'd say today we have an incredible hero
[1:07:06] and that's jesus
[1:07:10] there's a man in a foreign country
[1:07:14] defend democracy
[1:07:17] he has been known now as a modern day
[1:07:19] churchill
[1:07:21] uh
[1:07:22] a man that is screaming for help
[1:07:25] he's screaming for mercy he's screaming
[1:07:29] for strength
[1:07:30] he does not want to lose his own home
[1:07:32] country
[1:07:34] he does not want to see his his his
[1:07:37] people
[1:07:38] be defeated
[1:07:40] he's watching children he's watching
[1:07:42] children be destroyed
[1:07:45] i i heard a report this week that stood
[1:07:48] with me and
[1:07:49] and it's it's it's a report of the
[1:07:52] the salvation army or the red cross
[1:07:55] they picked up an entire busload of
[1:07:58] two-year-old children in the street that
[1:08:01] now has no mothers or fathers
[1:08:05] they're screaming for help
[1:08:09] countries don't know what to do
[1:08:12] because it looks like that we're on the
[1:08:14] brink of a world war
[1:08:16] it's prophesied that there is
[1:08:20] it's a sad thing to say that help no
[1:08:22] doubt is not coming in time
[1:08:25] but i want you to know as children of
[1:08:27] god
[1:08:31] let me just say when you scream
[1:08:33] you heard last night
[1:08:35] that the skies are filled with the
[1:08:38] angels of god
[1:08:40] that are fighting on your behalf
[1:08:45] and your war may look horrible by your
[1:08:48] temporary conditions
[1:08:51] but help is on the way
[1:08:55] and it's a kingdom that will never be
[1:08:57] defeated
[1:08:59] we've been in all kinds of wars
[1:09:01] throughout humanity but it's never been
[1:09:04] defeated
[1:09:06] our god has never lied he's never failed
[1:09:10] he's never lost the world
[1:09:12] [Applause]
[1:09:21] we stand with sons and daughters of god
[1:09:23] that have made a stand in their life
[1:09:26] sometimes you're challenged in your life
[1:09:28] to make a stand
[1:09:31] it's easy to stand with a thousand
[1:09:33] people but what about with you alone
[1:09:36] it's when a man stands alone in his
[1:09:38] convictions and he stands there he knows
[1:09:40] who he is he knows what he's fighting
[1:09:42] for
[1:09:45] and he's ready for the
[1:09:46] challenge now let me just remind you of
[1:09:49] who you are
[1:09:50] before the foundation of the world god
[1:09:53] had a photo album
[1:09:55] of the predestinated seed that was going
[1:09:57] to be on the earth
[1:09:59] some were chosen to live in dark ages
[1:10:04] and god equip them
[1:10:07] with the fortitude
[1:10:09] and the strength to get through the
[1:10:12] darkest of battles
[1:10:16] he chose you to live in just before
[1:10:19] laodicea
[1:10:21] just before the rapture
[1:10:23] just before at the climax's laodicea is
[1:10:27] blending
[1:10:28] it's darker than it's ever been
[1:10:32] [Music]
[1:10:35] it's darker it's more sinful it looks
[1:10:37] like the world is going into chaos
[1:10:40] and god chose you
[1:10:46] so let's remind the devil of who he's
[1:10:48] fighting
[1:10:51] let's remind him it's not our 200 my 200
[1:10:54] pounds of flesh
[1:10:56] that's going to win this war
[1:10:58] it's not because i'm five foot five
[1:11:02] but god put something on the inside of
[1:11:04] me
[1:11:07] that he's got confidence
[1:11:10] it's not my flesh it's not my
[1:11:12] personality it's not my humanity but he
[1:11:16] put a gene seed of himself
[1:11:19] on the inside of me
[1:11:23] that even god's got confidence
[1:11:28] he put himself on the inside
[1:11:31] [Applause]
[1:11:38] not the personality of moses
[1:11:41] not the personality of jeremiah or nahum
[1:11:45] or even wesley or or brother branham
[1:11:49] they struggle with their own humanity
[1:11:52] so don't glorify no flesh you keep your
[1:11:54] eyes on jesus
[1:11:58] you keep your eyes focused on jesus
[1:12:01] whoever you are this morning you keep
[1:12:03] your eyes if you've if you've lost focus
[1:12:05] if you've got disappointed in humanity
[1:12:08] you keep your eyes on jesus
[1:12:15] he will never fail you
[1:12:18] i want to say it again to you young
[1:12:19] people he'll never fail you
[1:12:32] take courage
[1:12:37] press the battle
[1:12:40] there's no time to turn around and run
[1:12:43] our equipment in ephesians chapter six
[1:12:47] is armor for the front
[1:12:49] not for the back
[1:12:54] and when you feel like giving up
[1:12:57] and the devil's whispered in your ear
[1:12:59] you know what i'm talking about
[1:13:01] when he's whispering in your ear
[1:13:02] remember he's a liar
[1:13:06] so if he's lying to you and telling you
[1:13:08] one thing remember when he's telling you
[1:13:10] that you're backslidden and nobody loves
[1:13:12] you it just ought to tell you
[1:13:15] that you're on the right track and all
[1:13:18] of heaven is behind you
[1:13:24] the scripture tells us to be strong
[1:13:27] and with good courage
[1:13:31] remember we're believers
[1:13:34] we're god's sons
[1:13:37] we've been called to this battle
[1:13:39] there's no backing off
[1:13:43] and neither will we back down
[1:13:49] over the last couple of weeks i've been
[1:13:51] asked by doctors that are wonderful
[1:13:53] doctors

[1:18:58] to go on
[1:19:00] and i'd say he's right
[1:19:05] but he hasn't been given the grace and
[1:19:06] the mercy to see what you've seen
[1:19:10] but he knows something's going on
[1:19:13] brother brown said recognizing your day
[1:19:15] and its message they are screaming fast
[1:19:17] and pray thanks you're riding the fence

[1:20:21] he destroys
[1:20:24] he's nobody to negotiate with
[1:20:29] i say this to you sin is pleasurable for
[1:20:31] a season
[1:20:34] 10 seconds in hell
[1:20:36] will make you quick a reminder i wish
[1:20:39] i'd never went there
[1:20:43] do i need to say that again it felt like
[1:20:45] i didn't get it through
[1:20:47] sin is pleasurable for a season

[1:21:24] lay your excuses down and run to the
[1:21:27] cross
[1:21:31] he's still in the saving business
[1:21:34] he can save the worst sinner in the
[1:21:36] world
[1:21:40] look around he's done it

[1:22:02] everybody's humiliated in hell nobody's
[1:22:05] friends in hell
[1:22:07] party buddies here will be hating you
[1:22:10] because you blame one another
[1:22:12] for getting yourself there
[1:22:14] you influence me to go the wrong
[1:22:16] direction in life
[1:22:18] why not take good influence today

[1:22:32] popularity will not buy your lunch
[1:22:38] popularity will only make you feel good
[1:22:40] for a little while
[1:22:43] but being a trophy in hell
[1:22:45] has no merit
[1:22:52] the scripture says this you know you've
[1:22:54] heard it so many thousands of times if
[1:22:56] you've been here with me
[1:22:57] and we know that all things work
[1:22:59] together
[1:23:01] for the good to them that left god to
[1:23:03] them who are the
[1:23:05] according
[1:23:07] to his purpose
[1:23:09] not my purpose not somebody else's
[1:23:11] purpose
[1:23:13] so many times parents want to live their
[1:23:16] children's life
[1:23:18] vicariously through them
[1:23:21] and making decisions
[1:23:23] with them
[1:23:26] always marvel at parents
[1:23:28] want to pick up children's fights
[1:23:31] so 50 year old people are fighting
[1:23:33] two-year-old battles
[1:23:45] making decisions for them
[1:23:47] i didn't get to do it
[1:23:49] i want you to do it
[1:23:51] really i want to ask you is that the
[1:23:53] proper way
[1:23:57] is that the proper way
[1:23:59] in america today we have american idol
[1:24:03] people vote
[1:24:06] people want to be a part of that that
[1:24:08] deal
[1:24:09] when they win they get a contract
[1:24:12] they get a recording labels
[1:24:19] did they really win
[1:24:22] did they really win
[1:24:24] no they sold their soul
[1:24:31] sometimes young gifted young men
[1:24:34] become sports stars
[1:24:37] hitting hitting a baseball or throwing a
[1:24:39] football or
[1:24:41] or
[1:24:42] whatever lacrosse or kicking a soccer
[1:24:45] ball
[1:24:46] what are you on
[1:24:49] well maybe it's a game
[1:24:51] that you know you just push the buttons
[1:24:53] and you become the champion of the world
[1:24:57] you're the warrior of warriors
[1:25:03] you're the warrior of warriors on a
[1:25:05] couch
[1:25:16] and when you've come to the end of your
[1:25:17] road
[1:25:19] you haven't defeated one devil
[1:25:23] satan has taken your life and he stole
[1:25:25] it and he's destroyed it
[1:25:27] [Applause]
[1:25:29] and when you could have spent your time
[1:25:30] for jesus
[1:25:32] and i learned something of quality and a
[1:25:35] challenged lives and then been an
[1:25:37] influence around you that others can see
[1:25:40] the light of jesus christ
[1:25:42] [Applause]
[1:25:44] satan convinced you to live in a
[1:25:46] basement
[1:26:12] let's give myself a break here
[1:26:18] really what have you won
[1:26:20] who won
[1:26:24] who won
[1:26:29] elvis presley didn't win
[1:26:34] marilyn monroe she didn't win

[1:26:40] always do the the celebrities that we
[1:26:43] lost this year
[1:26:44] they didn't win
[1:26:48] it's only what you've done for jesus
[1:26:49] that's what wins
[1:26:54] see don't get your eyes on nobody in
[1:26:56] hollywood
[1:27:10] when satan took jesus up on a mountain
[1:27:15] he set him down
[1:27:18] and he began to make him offers
[1:27:23] brother branham said
[1:27:24] that he was tempted to take it
[1:27:29] that's what he
[1:27:30] said he was tempted
[1:27:33] to take it
[1:27:35] offering a kingdom without a calvary
[1:27:43] so he will offer
[1:27:44] you things that you're tempted to take
[1:27:50] jobs that take you out of church
[1:27:54] a woman or a man that has no interest in
[1:27:56] serving god

[1:28:48] if i lived in noah's day and i'd had a
[1:28:50] ministry i'd have been calling noah

[1:38:20] we're going to be here for eternity gone
[1:38:24] they took a different road
[1:38:27] that road took them places choices take
[1:38:29] you places in your life
[1:38:36] by god's grace he's kept you
[1:38:42] how many drives at night
[1:38:45] how many drives at night yeah how many
[1:38:46] drives at night
[1:38:48] how many drives at night
[1:38:50] go ahead and raise your hand up how many
[1:38:51] drives that night
[1:38:52] did you hear me it drives at night
[1:38:55] well here's a one of the must that you
[1:38:57] must do turn on your lights
[1:39:07] i didn't do a study on this real quick
[1:39:09] but
[1:39:10] listen your lights will only shine so
[1:39:12] far
[1:39:14] regardless if they're the new kind of
[1:39:16] lights or the old kind of lights or them
[1:39:18] round lights they only they only
[1:39:20] show you so far
[1:39:22] so it is not good for you to look out
[1:39:25] into the darkness
[1:39:31] are you with me
[1:39:32] it's not good for you to look out and
[1:39:34] cross bridges before you get to them
[1:39:39] only drive where the light's at
[1:39:45] generally there's a line painted on this
[1:39:47] side of the road
[1:39:49] and there's a there's dots on this side
[1:39:51] and there's rumble strips
[1:39:54] it's good to stay in the middle
[1:40:00] don't be a hero and get over in the
[1:40:02] bushes
[1:40:06] climb over in the medium some of those
[1:40:08] are strange places to park
[1:40:18] i've seen too many people sitting in
[1:40:20] church
[1:40:21] run off in the medium
[1:40:28] taking your own path in life
[1:40:31] there's a song says that elvis sung and
[1:40:33] he said i did it my way
[1:40:39] i'm not going to quote the lyrics to you
[1:40:40] today
[1:40:42] but he says i did it my way
[1:40:44] well it wasn't a good way
[1:40:47] as a matter of fact in the satanic
[1:40:49] worship it is the number one song
[1:40:54] that is sung
[1:40:55] i did it
[1:40:56] my way
[1:40:59] brother on i'm going to do it my way
[1:41:02] where is that influence coming from
[1:41:10] sometimes we want christianity the way
[1:41:12] that we want it
[1:41:15] uh you know
[1:41:16] we want the holy ghost
[1:41:19] but we don't want to die out to get it
[1:41:23] and maybe we want the holy ghost without
[1:41:25] a sensation because we got a quote
[1:41:28] we we want the holy ghost without
[1:41:29] sensation i don't want it to make me act
[1:41:31] funny
[1:41:34] i don't want to i don't want my mascara
[1:41:37] to run
[1:41:41] i
[1:41:41] i i don't want to get all excited and my
[1:41:44] tongue begin to lose control and i start
[1:41:46] speaking in a heavenly language
[1:41:52] because because it comes with it
[1:41:56] it's not the evidence but it comes with
[1:41:58] it
[1:41:59] some will see vision some will dream
[1:42:00] dreams some will speak in tongues
[1:42:03] whatever i've got to do i got to break
[1:42:05] through this humanity to get what i need
[1:42:08] because i can't overcome this on my own
[1:42:15] but brother ron it feels like in my life
[1:42:16] i've been in a fog
[1:42:18] open the door
[1:42:21] and look down at the line and make you
[1:42:23] sure you're still in the middle of the
[1:42:25] road
[1:42:26] find yourself in the word
[1:42:30] it ain't god's left you you've just left
[1:42:33] fellowship
[1:42:34] [Applause]
[1:42:37] where is the easiest place to backslide
[1:42:39] it's not in a bar
[1:42:41] not listening to country music and rock
[1:42:43] and roll music and dressing the wrong
[1:42:45] kind of way
[1:42:47] sitting in the pew and not receiving
[1:42:51] fold in your arms and say i i made it i
[1:42:53] hope the rest of y'all catch up
[1:42:58] some of you jumping up and down you know
[1:43:00] if you you know if you just you know sit
[1:43:03] still because i can't see
[1:43:06] you jump up and then i can't see
[1:43:10] well if
[1:43:13] let me just tell you a couple of things
[1:43:15] it's kind of like an old woman went to a
[1:43:17] baptist church
[1:43:19] and every time the preacher said
[1:43:20] something she said glory to god
[1:43:24] excites me
[1:43:25] the deacon knocked pecked on the
[1:43:27] shoulder and said
[1:43:28] we don't do that here
[1:43:32] she said when i got jesus
[1:43:34] it causes an excitement on the inside of
[1:43:37] me we don't do that here
[1:43:42] he said something else that made her
[1:43:44] excited she jumped up to her feet
[1:43:52] and a deacon pecked her on the shoulder
[1:43:54] again and said we don't do that here
[1:44:05] she said well i got jesus
[1:44:08] said we don't do that here
[1:44:14] so sometimes what you need is more jesus
[1:44:18] [Applause]
[1:44:20] my mother was a wonderful little woman
[1:44:24] she had a little spin that she did when
[1:44:25] she shouted
[1:44:28] and this shirt set her down
[1:44:32] i heard about it
[1:44:34] i needed more jesus when i heard that
[1:44:43] i'll tell you why churches get cold
[1:44:46] they have an nice machine for
[1:44:48] a preacher
[1:44:59] and i don't know if you have got a good
[1:45:01] education or not but ice machines
[1:45:03] produces ice cubes
[1:45:05] and then the church gets 40 below zero
[1:45:09] and everybody's dead still like a morgue
[1:45:14] but we don't do that here
[1:45:34] i've got a little problem with emotion
[1:45:37] i had three children born
[1:45:41] it was
[1:45:42] thrilling to hear those children
[1:45:47] scream
[1:45:48] right after they were born
[1:45:55] let me explain something to you for
[1:45:57] those that don't have children
[1:45:59] i'm always amazed at young couples my
[1:46:01] child will never be like that
[1:46:10] matcha
[1:46:13] it's those people that could write a
[1:46:15] book
[1:46:17] about how to raise children
[1:46:21] my child will never be like it
[1:46:25] tomorrow morning i get a dog
[1:46:28] i get a new dog
[1:46:30] yeah
[1:46:31] my dog died it was an australian
[1:46:33] shepherd
[1:46:34] it lived to be about seven and a half
[1:46:36] years old it got cancer and it died
[1:46:39] it the doctor actually told me to put it
[1:46:41] down a month before and i said uh-uh not
[1:46:44] my dog
[1:46:46] i didn't realize i didn't have but a few
[1:46:48] weeks left
[1:46:49] for it before it would go home
[1:46:51] heaven will be full of some of my dogs
[1:46:55] best day man i got all wheels on service
[1:46:59] tomorrow morning i'm gonna pick up a dog
[1:47:02] it's called bernadoodle
[1:47:08] now my wife wouldn't let me have a
[1:47:09] bernese mountain dog because it sheds it
[1:47:11] sheds really bad
[1:47:13] for those that don't know they're about
[1:47:14] that big and they shed
[1:47:17] they shed everywhere so what you do is
[1:47:19] you take a
[1:47:20] burmese mountain dog and you mix it with
[1:47:22] a poo
[1:47:28] you know what
[1:47:30] you know what
[1:47:32] and it keeps it from
[1:47:34] it's now hyper allergenic
[1:47:38] did i say that correct
[1:47:42] and so you hope there's traits from this
[1:47:45] dog to this dog
[1:47:50] owner that is
[1:47:52] selling me the dog says that my little
[1:47:54] dog is a princess
[1:47:58] said she's an absolute princess of all
[1:48:00] of the
[1:48:01] the little brood she's the princess of
[1:48:04] them all
[1:48:05] well she's coming to a house
[1:48:07] where she's gonna be spoiled
[1:48:10] and peppered
[1:48:12] and loved on
[1:48:15] and cared for
[1:48:18] it's going to be her house
[1:48:21] to live in is that right bro vernon
[1:48:23] that's right
[1:48:25] [Applause]
[1:48:27] that's right
[1:48:34] but i'm still king
[1:48:38] and so when she chews on my furniture
[1:48:41] i'm gonna get her
[1:48:45] when she chews on the rungs of my chairs
[1:48:47] i'm going to get her
[1:48:51] when she eats my bacon and egg sandwich
[1:48:53] in the morning
[1:48:56] i'mma get her
[1:49:01] what are you doing brother ron i'm
[1:49:02] talking about you
[1:49:06] god knew before he brought you to this
[1:49:08] church
[1:49:10] you chewed on sofas
[1:49:14] you chewed on rungs of chairs
[1:49:18] but he still picked you up and he rubbed
[1:49:20] you and he cuddled over you i said this
[1:49:22] is my child
[1:49:30] and i'm going to train you to be
[1:49:32] citizens of the kingdom of god
[1:49:35] you're not going to drink no more and
[1:49:37] you're not going to smoke no more you're
[1:49:38] not going to run out on your wife no
[1:49:40] more but i'm gonna give you a kingdom
[1:49:55] and he did
[1:49:57] now you see
[1:49:59] in my earlier life i
[1:50:02] i was a chimney sweep
[1:50:07] and i learned something real quick
[1:50:10] that when i went into somebody's house
[1:50:12] that dog
[1:50:14] had as much rights as the children had
[1:50:26] and so i'd rub that dog sometimes he'd
[1:50:28] rub me back
[1:50:31] i was bit on a couple of occasions
[1:50:34] i didn't like it
[1:50:37] but i didn't i couldn't beat the dog
[1:50:41] but i could shut the door
[1:50:44] and he couldn't get to me
[1:50:48] but i began to realize that people built
[1:50:50] great big houses million dollar houses
[1:50:52] for that dog to live in
[1:50:58] and that dog just wondered where he
[1:50:59] wanted to
[1:51:01] he's wondered what i would do is i'd
[1:51:03] throw out
[1:51:04] great big tarps
[1:51:06] in front of the chimney in case i made a
[1:51:09] mess
[1:51:10] which i did ninety percent of the time
[1:51:14] and it would catch all the nonsense
[1:51:17] but a lot of them dogs would lay right
[1:51:18] on that tarp
[1:51:22] and just look at me
[1:51:28] through the years i'd build up
[1:51:29] relationships
[1:51:31] with some of those dogs
[1:51:33] because some of them were better than
[1:51:35] their owner
[1:51:43] i got a point to there right here
[1:51:45] i got a real point
[1:51:48] if i can train a dog
[1:51:50] you can train your children
[1:51:56] you can train your children
[1:51:59] now i'm not speaking as a kid that don't
[1:52:01] have no children
[1:52:03] because now i got grandchildren
[1:52:05] but if i can train a dog
[1:52:11] that don't know me yet
[1:52:16] are y'all out there
[1:52:18] am i preaching on a radio broadcast here
[1:52:22] is this microphone working
[1:52:26] if we can train a dog what about our
[1:52:28] children
[1:52:33] what you don't know is i took you on a
[1:52:35] journey
[1:52:36] i started you out with i did it my way
[1:52:40] and we're in a battle
[1:52:42] but your battle is not with putin
[1:52:49] your battle is not with putin today
[1:52:52] probably for most of us sitting in this
[1:52:53] building it'll never be with putin
[1:52:58] are you with me
[1:53:00] we're not to even fear communism
[1:53:03] that that's not what we're supposed to
[1:53:04] fear
[1:53:07] but it's that blended religion of
[1:53:08] catholicism
[1:53:12] where everybody's born again and
[1:53:13] everybody's got their own idea that's
[1:53:16] what you're supposed to feel
[1:53:20] our greatest enemy is not biden
[1:53:26] every time i pump gas i blame him
[1:53:32] but
[1:53:34] let me just say your greatest enemy is
[1:53:36] not him
[1:53:37] you guys are school teachers
[1:53:40] you probably have more trouble with
[1:53:42] parents than you do children
[1:53:48] you know
[1:53:50] my child will never do that my child no
[1:53:52] way that they did that yes they did i
[1:53:54] watched them
[1:53:55] i i watched them i videoed them
[1:53:58] i know they did that i know they did it
[1:54:00] my child would never do it
[1:54:02] turn your child loose
[1:54:06] and see if it reflects jesus
[1:54:12] that's what god has did in this hour
[1:54:15] now i've took you on a full circle god
[1:54:18] has turned his children loose
[1:54:21] to be the greatest army
[1:54:26] the greatest army in the most difficult
[1:54:28] hour
[1:54:29] he puts you in the time of trouble
[1:54:32] he trained you for battle
[1:54:35] he got you ready he groomed you
[1:54:39] he cleaned you
[1:54:41] [Applause]
[1:54:43] he gave you the greatest weapons he
[1:54:44] could give you with that was his battle
[1:54:46] his word
[1:54:48] and his word will defeat the devil
[1:54:50] anywhere any place at any time under any
[1:54:54] conditions
[1:55:01] i want to say this to you in closing you
[1:55:04] do not have to live a defeated life
[1:55:10] you do not have to beat yourself all the
[1:55:11] time
[1:55:18] every day is a new day
[1:55:24] can i come to this just a moment
[1:55:26] can i give you something personal now
[1:55:31] there are some mornings when i wake up
[1:55:32] and i take a chemo
[1:55:36] probably seven
[1:55:38] five out of seven days
[1:55:41] no reaction
[1:55:43] almost like taking a sugar pill no
[1:55:46] reaction and i go about my business
[1:55:49] but a couple of those days
[1:55:51] i'm sick
[1:55:54] i'm throwing up
[1:55:55] my head screaming
[1:55:58] but it ain't gonna last forever
[1:56:00] so i just hold on
[1:56:03] until it's over
[1:56:04] and i say in a few hours i'm gonna be
[1:56:07] better
[1:56:11] can i can i speak to you now
[1:56:14] in your temporary situations that you
[1:56:17] get into yours may not be cancer
[1:56:22] but in your temporary situations that
[1:56:24] you get into
[1:56:26] most of it ain't going to last forever
[1:56:29] you just keep looking where the light is
[1:56:31] shining
[1:56:32] don't look out into the darkness you
[1:56:34] just keep looking where the light is
[1:56:36] shining and just keep walking
[1:56:43] that's what enoch did the world was
[1:56:45] falling apart but he just kept walking
[1:56:49] and one day he just walked right off of
[1:56:51] the earth
[1:56:52] so that's what we're going to do
[1:57:13] brother ron will tomorrow be better
[1:57:15] it's your attitude
[1:57:19] attitude
[1:57:20] is a hundred percent
[1:57:22] of your situation
[1:57:26] attitude is what you get when you get in
[1:57:28] service
[1:57:31] this could be the best service i've ever
[1:57:32] been in so you keep pulling
[1:57:36] jesus is going to walk by my isle and
[1:57:38] i'm waiting on him i'm waiting just to
[1:57:40] worship him just a little bit
[1:57:48] why don't you just let god override
[1:57:50] every excuse that you got
[1:57:54] every excuse
[1:57:58] sometimes
[1:57:59] and this is honestly this is honest
[1:58:01] sometimes i just write my excuses down
[1:58:05] of the difficulty of the day i actually
[1:58:07] write it down and then i walk by a big
[1:58:09] old gray garbage pail that i got in my
[1:58:11] house and i just throw all my excuses in
[1:58:14] there
[1:58:16] i literally do that
[1:58:18] i just write it down when i can't handle
[1:58:20] it no more i just write it down and then
[1:58:21] when i get done writing it down just
[1:58:22] walk over and throw it right in trash
[1:58:24] can because it don't matter
[1:58:27] once you start making a list
[1:58:30] i'll just start making a list
[1:58:34] start making a list sister linda
