[20:39] &gt;&gt; How many appreciated that word last
[20:41] night?
[20:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah. This song I'm about to This
[20:45] morning I heard brother Phil Ron Calli
[20:48] sing it. He never left me. I thought
[20:50] about it as brother Matt preached last
[20:52] night where I went through a time in my
[20:55] life where I'd gave my heart to the Lord
[20:56] and I fell back to the cares of the
[20:58] world.
[21:00] In about a year and a half, you know,
[21:01] the Lord never quit talking to me
[21:04] dealing with my heart.
[21:07] I'm so thankful that he never gave up on
[21:09] me.
[21:10] &gt;&gt; You know, he knew something I didn't. He
[21:13] knew I was his.
[21:15] &gt;&gt; Now I know that I that he's mine.
[21:19] &gt;&gt; Brother Matt spoke about a love last
[21:21] night. You know, someone that ain't got
[21:24] Christ in their life, they know the
[21:26] difference of people that do and they
[21:27] don't.
[21:29] &gt;&gt; The devil told me when I come back,
[21:32] people's going to laugh. They going to
[21:33] say, "Here he is again. He couldn't
[21:35] stand the first time. He's back. He's
[21:37] going to try it again." You know, that's
[21:38] what the enemy does. But when I came
[21:41] through them doors back there, I wasn't
[21:42] here 30 seconds. And I knew I'd been
[21:44] lied to
[21:46] &gt;&gt; cuz brother brother Bill, brother John
[21:49] Kelly, brother Ralph met me with a love
[21:53] that I knew was real.
[21:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[21:55] &gt;&gt; And I tell you, you say, "Well, what
[21:57] kind of difference did it make? I'm
[21:58] here.
[22:00] &gt;&gt; I knew I done got in the presence of
[22:01] something real." And I knew that God
[22:03] would give me that kind of love. And I
[22:05] think that's the kind of love we want.
[22:06] What Brother Matt spoke about last
[22:08] night. I just pray I believe that's each
[22:11] one of our desires that we'd be so full
[22:13] of that love that we can take that to
[22:14] our job just like he said
[22:16] &gt;&gt; for those that maybe got something
[22:17] against us for no reason. You know, we
[22:19] just want to live that life that's salty
[22:21] because a person knows when they get in
[22:23] that real presence
[22:25] &gt;&gt; of God. And I'm just thankful for him
[22:27] and what he's done for me in my life.
[22:29] Amen.
[22:33] &gt;&gt; So many directions.
[22:39] You know the roads all look the same.
[22:46] He gave me instruction.
[22:48] [Music]
[22:52] I disregarded
[22:54] in shame.
[22:59] Oh, and sudden destruction.
[23:06] You know, it soon came my way.
[23:14] And I have to say
[23:20] I only had me to blame.
[23:28] Oh, but he never left me.
[23:35] Though I turned my
[23:38] back on him,
[23:42] I was living in a world of sin.
[23:50] I was trying to run away.
[23:57] He never left me
[24:05] when I chose to
[24:09] walk away.
[24:12] Even when I couldn't pray,
[24:18] you know, he never left me.
[24:26] You know, I chose the wrong road
[24:33] because it looked good
[24:35] to me.
[24:40] I walked blindly on the word.
[24:47] You know, I just couldn't see.
[24:54] Oh, that I was lost and I was dying.
[25:01] Oh, but now I'm
[25:05] trying.
[25:09] You know I reached out
[25:12] to Jesus.
[25:16] Oh, you know he reached out
[25:19] to me.
[25:24] I found that he never left me.
[25:31] Though I turned my
[25:34] back on him,
[25:39] I was living in a world of sin.
[25:46] I was trying to run away.
[25:50] [Music]
[25:54] He never left me.
[26:02] when I chose to
[26:06] to walk away
[26:09] even when I couldn't pray.
[26:16] You know, he never left me.
[26:23] You see, I chose the wrong room.
[26:31] because it looked good
[26:34] to me.
[26:39] I walked blindly onward.
[26:45] You know, I just could not see
[26:53] that I was lost and I was dying.
[27:01] Oh, but now I'm
[27:04] trying.
[27:08] You know, I reached out
[27:11] to Jesus.
[27:15] You know, he reached out
[27:19] to me
[27:24] and he never left me.
[27:31] Though I turned my
[27:34] back on him,
[27:39] I was living in a world of sin.
[27:46] I was trying to run away
[27:50] again.
[27:56] Oh, but he never left me
[28:03] when I chose to
[28:06] walk away.
[28:08] [Music]
[28:11] And even when I
[28:14] couldn't pray,
[28:18] you know, he never left me.
[28:23] [Music]
[28:28] [Applause]
[29:07] [Music]
[29:25] There are moments nothing can
[29:34] heaven and earth meet face to face.
[29:41] When a broken heart begins to change,
[29:48] the word takes on flesh and a soul finds
[29:52] faith.
[29:56] Where the unfulfilled
[29:58] are satisfied
[30:04] &gt;&gt; and the unknown scars are relying.
[30:11] There's an open door to a brand new life
[30:20] in the presence of the Savior.
[30:26] I just want to be in the room. Want to
[30:29] be in a room when you move.
[30:33] And I'm not leaving.
[30:36] Not leaving till you do.
[30:42] I just want to be in the room. Want to
[30:45] be in the room when you move.
[30:48] And I'm not leaving.
[30:51] Not leaving till you do.
[30:56] [Music]
[30:58] Want to see the blind receive their
[31:02] sight.
[31:06] Hear the praise of the voiceless start
[31:09] to rise.
[31:12] [Music]
[31:14] Every child of God baptized with fire
[31:22] right here in the presence of the hero.
[31:29] I just want to be in the room. Want to
[31:32] be in the room when you move.
[31:36] And I'm not leaving.
[31:38] Not leaving till you do.
[31:43] I don't want to miss it. I just want to
[31:46] be in the room. Want to be in the room
[31:49] when you move.
[31:52] And I'm not leaving.
[31:54] Not leaving till you do.
[32:01] You're off the roof.
[32:04] Whatever it takes to get me to you.
[32:10] [Music]
[32:16] Tear off the roof. Lower me down.
[32:20] Whatever it takes to get me to you.
[32:27] Get me to you.
[32:30] [Music]
[32:32] Tear off the rule of knowing me down.
[32:36] Whatever it takes to get me to you.
[32:40] Won't every soul push to the ground.
[32:44] God, I want to see you break through.
[32:48] Tear off the roof. Lower me down.

[33:52] Tear off the roof. Lower me down.
[33:56] Whatever it takes to get me to you. Roll
[34:00] every stone. Push through the ground.

[36:25] living in my soul.

[36:32] in his word
[36:38] that he will make us whole.
[36:42] Well, it is time for it to happen.

[36:54] [Music]
[36:56] It will make and bring to pass that
[37:01] tremendous victory

[37:38] I see a vision
[37:42] breaking,
[37:47] a power that would bind that mamba,
[37:53] the third pole ministry.
[38:01] Now's my time for consideration.
[38:08] I must
[38:11] see a change in me.
[38:16] I will enter my secret closet
[38:21] and close the door
[38:26] behind me.
[38:30] I'll keep the feast of unleaven bread
[38:37] with truth and prosperity.
[38:44] For I'm expecting
[38:47] Jehovah
[38:49] Shyra,
[38:52] my Lord,
[38:54] to be with me.
[38:59] For I'm tired

[39:15] I'm heading down
[39:20] to the Jordan.
[39:27] And low before me,
[39:32] I see a vision
[39:36] breaking.
[39:39] [Music]
[39:41] It's a power that will bind that mamba

[39:57] Oh, now's my time for consecration
[40:06] because I must see a change in me.
[40:13] Oh, I will enter my secret closet
[40:20] and close the door
[40:23] [Music]
[40:24] behind me.
[40:28] I'll keep the feast of unleaven
[40:33] bread
[40:36] with truth and sincerity
[40:44] for I'm expecting
[40:47] Jehovah
[40:49] cha
[40:52] oh my lord
[40:54] to be with me.
[40:59] Lord, keep that holy
[41:03] fire burning,
[41:06] burning
[41:10] within my soul.
[41:15] Change me from glory
[41:18] unto gloryy
[41:22] until it is your image
[41:26] you will behold.
[41:30] Let's keep this holy
[41:34] convocation
[41:38] till we become
[41:41] the new creation.
[41:46] For it's the message
[41:49] in you and me
[41:52] that will bring us the tremendous
[41:57] victory.

[42:39] a vision
[42:42] breaking.
[42:47] It's a power that will bind
[42:51] that mumble.
[42:54] The third pull ministry.
[42:58] [Music]
[43:03] It's a power that will bind
[43:07] that ma
[43:10] the word in you and me.
[43:18] It's a power that will bind
[43:22] that ma
[43:25] the third ministry.

[51:45] Oh, I long for those moments when just
[51:49] you and I
[51:51] get lost in your presence
[51:54] and lose track of time.
[51:57] When I'm overwhelmed
[51:59] by your glory divine
[52:02] and I'm left with only one thing to do,
[52:07] worshiping you.
[52:13] woriing you.
[52:19] Oh, there's nothing else that I
[52:26] ra
[52:31] woriing you.
[52:37] worshiping you.

[52:55] Lord, isn't it? Amen. Amen. God bless
[52:59] you today. If you have your Bibles, we'd
[53:01] like to look in the book of Mark,
[53:02] chapter 2.
[53:07] Man,
[53:09] just want to make a mention here. Um,
[53:13] for those that are on the internet and
[53:15] and those that are that consider this
[53:17] their their home church and are in in a
[53:20] driving distance and they they can't
[53:21] make it um at every single service, but
[53:24] we just want to make this and kind of
[53:26] give a u just a little bit of time for
[53:29] preparation for those that would like to
[53:30] be here. on October the 4th, we are
[53:33] planning to have communion and
[53:34] footwashing here. And so we just want
[53:37] that to be upon the people's minds this
[53:39] weekend. Uh uh we're just giving brother
[53:42] Ron a break. And uh so u he we're very
[53:47] happy we're very happy to have our
[53:49] brother Ron and and to uh allow us to
[53:52] take this Sunday morning here. Amen.
[53:56] You know, every every once in a while it
[53:58] takes you just you just got to have a
[53:59] good break every once in a while. And
[54:02] man, I I brother Brandon will talk about
[54:04] that sometimes. You just got to have a a
[54:06] time of refilling and and that's that's
[54:09] truly what we had last night and last
[54:12] weekend and where God come and filled
[54:14] our cup to the brim and Amen. Isn't it
[54:17] good to be a Christian?
[54:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. I would like to uh just speak to
[54:22] you today something I I had I had me
[54:25] another sermon picked out here today and
[54:27] uh it was it was it was one of them
[54:30] Andrew sermons, you know, it was it was
[54:32] one that I would have enjoyed preaching.
[54:35] Brother Matt Mccclard and Sister Dorothy
[54:37] had bought me some new shoes for my
[54:38] birthday and and I I was just intending
[54:41] on breaking them things in and a good
[54:43] one them a good old dancing sermons this
[54:45] morning. But this morning, the Lord woke
[54:47] me up and just um kept speaking a word
[54:50] to me um about 5 5:30 this morning. And
[54:54] so I'd like to just speak to you on a
[54:56] thought on identified in the
[54:58] breakthrough. Identified in the
[55:00] breakthrough. Mark chapter 2 and verse
[55:03] one. And again he'd entered into
[55:06] Capernaum after some days and it was
[55:10] noised that he was in the house.
[55:14] It's a powerful thing
[55:17] when he's in the house
[55:19] &gt;&gt; and then everybody else recognizes it.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; It's one thing for him to be here,
[55:25] &gt;&gt; but it's another thing for us to
[55:26] recognize his presence.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; And straightway many were gathered
[55:32] together in so much that there was no
[55:34] room to receive them. No, not so much as
[55:39] about the door.
[55:41] It would be kind of like
[55:44] our Labor Days in a sense.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; Everybody's heard that Jesus is going to
[55:48] be in the house.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; Everybody's packed in. They're sitting
[55:53] on the countertops. They're sitting on
[55:56] the couch. They're sitting on the floor.
[55:58] Everybody's leaning up against the
[56:00] window. And they're sitting on the
[56:02] outside and they're peeking through the
[56:04] windows and they're listening.
[56:06] Now, if I was those people,
[56:10] I'd been as close as I could have got.
[56:12] That's
[56:12] &gt;&gt; right.
[56:13] &gt;&gt; I'd have put if I if I'd have had to
[56:15] stick my head through the window or just
[56:17] lean over top of somebody just to hear
[56:18] him say the right word.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; I'd been right there.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; And there was no room to receive them.
[56:26] No, not so much as about the door. And
[56:29] he preached the word unto them. And they
[56:32] came unto him bringing one sick of Pauly
[56:35] which was born of four. And when they
[56:38] could not come nigh unto him for the
[56:41] press, they uncovered the roof where he
[56:44] was. And when they had broken it up,
[56:48] they let down the bed wherein the sick
[56:51] of Pauly
[56:53] lay. Let's just speak to the Lord just
[56:55] for a minute. Heavenly Father, we come
[56:58] before you, Lord, this morning. Lord,
[57:00] we're your children, Father, and count
[57:02] it in honor, Lord Jesus, to know that
[57:04] you have birthed us into thy kingdom,
[57:06] Lord Jesus. To realize your true
[57:09] greatness is here amongst us, Lord
[57:11] Jesus. To realize that you have come
[57:13] into this house, Lord, and others are
[57:16] speaking to others, whispering through
[57:18] the ears,
[57:20] he was to pass by this way.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; And I believe that the master has called
[57:25] this morning and he's calling for us.
[57:28] And father, I pray, Lord Jesus, that you
[57:31] would allow your servant, Lord. I've
[57:33] humbled myself. I've tried to get myself
[57:35] out of the way, Lord, completely, Lord,
[57:38] yielding my vessel to you. Now, Father,
[57:41] you see your children, Lord Jesus. You
[57:43] see exactly what they are dealing with
[57:45] in their spiritual walk. And we ask,
[57:47] Lord Jesus, that thou wouldest come. And
[57:50] Lord, that you would just sit down at
[57:51] the table, Lord, and you begin to teach
[57:53] us your word, Father. And may while you
[57:56] begin to teach and preach the word,
[57:58] Father, may may hearts be ministered to,
[58:01] Lord, I pray that no matter what we've
[58:04] got to do in this service, Lord, may we
[58:07] get to you, Father. whatever we've got
[58:09] to tear apart, whatever we've got to get
[58:11] to, Lord Jesus, to just to press through
[58:14] the mark, Lord God, to come closer to
[58:16] you, Lord, I pray that you would take
[58:18] control of every spirit just now,
[58:20] Father. And that you would use this
[58:22] sermon, Lord, this service today to be
[58:25] edifying to your body, Father. That it
[58:27] would glorify the God of heaven, Lord.
[58:30] Lord, we study, we prepare, Lord, and
[58:32] then you come and you begin to show
[58:34] forth your your mind, Lord. And we just
[58:37] want to completely envelope ourselves in
[58:40] your mindset today that you could come
[58:42] in such a special way, Father, that we
[58:45] would recognize that you was in the
[58:47] room. Lord, we love you so much and give
[58:49] you this service today in the name of
[58:52] Jesus Christ. Amen. You may be seated
[58:55] today in the presence of the Lord. As we
[58:57] said, we'd like to just title this
[58:59] little message on identified in the
[59:02] breakthrough. And I I didn't even I
[59:04] didn't even I didn't even have enough
[59:06] time to really prepare for this thought,
[59:08] but it's just just what the Lord was
[59:10] speaking to me this morning. And and I I
[59:12] I just trust that the Lord will get
[59:14] behind this this morning. And we find
[59:16] right here in this scripture that faith
[59:20] will find a way no matter what. Faith
[59:22] will find the way. And that's the kind
[59:24] of faith that this this believing group
[59:27] of people had. These four people it said
[59:30] they came unto him bringing one sick of
[59:33] the policy and they had that kind of a
[59:36] desperate faith. You see true faith will
[59:38] never stop at barriers. Sometimes you
[59:42] have to get to a place or a position in
[59:44] your life that you have to literally
[59:47] tear off the roof and remove whatever
[59:49] begins to stand in the way of you
[59:52] getting to Christ. And we realize that
[59:55] that we that we are identified as
[59:58] Christians that we are identified as
[1:00:00] believers. But we also carry about in
[1:00:02] our bodies we carry identities. There
[1:00:05] are things in our DNA. There are things
[1:00:07] in our in our human walk that we carry.
[1:00:10] Every one of us have our own identity.
[1:00:13] And nobody else can make that up except
[1:00:15] for us. And we realize that they are
[1:00:17] also on the inside of us that God placed
[1:00:20] the gene seed of God on the on the
[1:00:22] inside of us. And everything everything
[1:00:25] about what he placed on the inside of us
[1:00:27] carries about his demeanor and his
[1:00:30] identity as well. Each and every one of
[1:00:33] us it we we write things. Our signature
[1:00:36] is different. Our our fingerprints are
[1:00:38] different. We even have a digital
[1:00:41] digital stamps about us even all over
[1:00:44] the internet now that that prove who you
[1:00:47] are. And there is a major thing that we
[1:00:49] live in in this world is the case of
[1:00:53] identity theft often times where
[1:00:55] somebody wants to come in and steal
[1:00:57] somebody's identity so that they get the
[1:01:00] benefits that that person is getting.
[1:01:02] They get their social security. They get
[1:01:05] their they get some of their tax
[1:01:07] credits. They get different things. what
[1:01:09] it is. It's a bogus that is trying to
[1:01:11] act like the reality. And in reality,
[1:01:14] all they are is a counterfeit. And I
[1:01:17] think it's powerful when you begin to
[1:01:19] study the message of the hour and you
[1:01:21] begin to look at it from the eyes of an
[1:01:23] eagle anointing and through a seer,
[1:01:25] through a prophet that we recognize that
[1:01:28] there this this message has words of
[1:01:31] power. And truly, you begin to look at
[1:01:33] it, the message has the ability to find
[1:01:36] out who we truly are. Even though we
[1:01:39] have layers of of our of our DNA that
[1:01:42] are there, we we have things that we
[1:01:45] have built up, complexes and stigmas, we
[1:01:48] have things that we have built up in our
[1:01:50] own mind. We have things that we have
[1:01:52] went through. We have things that we are
[1:01:55] are are intending to go through. But we
[1:01:57] find that the message of the hour finds
[1:02:00] us exactly who we truly are. And it
[1:02:03] speaks to us on on our level exactly
[1:02:06] where we need him to speak to us. And I
[1:02:08] think it's so amazing that God could
[1:02:10] take a hillbilly Kentucky and he could
[1:02:13] speak to us in deep levels. He could
[1:02:15] speak to us on the surface and he could
[1:02:17] go beyond the surface. And I think it's
[1:02:20] amazing when the eagle anointing begins
[1:02:22] to pierce right into the depths of our
[1:02:25] soul and it begins to bring out our true
[1:02:28] identity. We can look at it and see that
[1:02:30] God has pre-planned our coming here to
[1:02:33] this world so that we recognize that
[1:02:36] we're not just caring about our father's
[1:02:38] DNA or our mother's DNA, but we are
[1:02:40] caring about a heavenly DNA that will
[1:02:42] literally take us into a position that
[1:02:45] only a believer can go through.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; That's right. Now, true identity,
[1:02:49] brother Brandham would teach us that
[1:02:51] true identification is shown to us by
[1:02:54] God's characteristics. And it's not just
[1:02:56] by fundamentals because Balam had the
[1:02:59] fundamentals, but Moses had the fire.
[1:03:02] Balam had the doctrine, but Moses had
[1:03:05] the demonstration and the power. And we
[1:03:07] recognize this about God's presence is
[1:03:10] that God's presence brings about a
[1:03:12] supernatural confirmation. Whenever
[1:03:15] Jesus would show up or or when God would
[1:03:17] show up, the pillar of fire was there.
[1:03:18] The the you begin to see the you begin
[1:03:21] to see the water. You begin to see the
[1:03:22] smitten rock. You begin to see the brass
[1:03:25] serpent. You begin to see healings that
[1:03:26] would transpire. You see, because God
[1:03:29] was going to show about his identity and
[1:03:32] his characteristics would always align
[1:03:34] with the promise of the age that he was
[1:03:37] coming to. And how they recognized that
[1:03:40] God was with them was that there was a
[1:03:42] shout of the king in the midst of the
[1:03:44] camp there. And it was showing that God
[1:03:47] that his atonement and his authority was
[1:03:50] with them when they had the shout of the
[1:03:53] king. And I think it's powerful when you
[1:03:55] begin to identify what this message is.
[1:03:58] It is the shout of the king. And I
[1:04:01] believe that is literally what has have
[1:04:04] given us the ability to break through
[1:04:06] denominational barriers and break
[1:04:08] through our ideologies. And it really
[1:04:11] proves our identity when we fully
[1:04:14] accept. Hallelujah. When we fully accept
[1:04:17] that this message is a part of
[1:04:20] ourselves.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; You see, because God's characteristics
[1:04:25] are always supernatural. It's not like
[1:04:28] Balam's ways of natural things. You see,
[1:04:31] when you begin to notice in Balam and
[1:04:33] Moses, Moses, the difference wasn't in
[1:04:35] the teaching because they was teaching
[1:04:38] the same things. The difference was that
[1:04:41] the characteristics of God was
[1:04:43] identifying himself right amongst Moses.
[1:04:46] What was it? God was identifying
[1:04:48] himself. Hallelujah. That he was going
[1:04:51] to rewrite another second book of Acts
[1:04:54] right here in this generation. So
[1:04:57] therefore, God identify himself in a
[1:05:00] bride body.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; Brother Madam would say and show us the
[1:05:05] father and it sufficeth us. He said, "I
[1:05:08] believe that God's going to give us a
[1:05:11] breakthrough tonight. I believe it is on
[1:05:14] the audience."
[1:05:16] Now, I don't know if I don't know if you
[1:05:18] recognize this, but I guarantee you that
[1:05:22] there are people that showed up in this
[1:05:24] room to worship the Lord this morning.
[1:05:26] I guarantee you that there are people
[1:05:28] that showed up today just to raise their
[1:05:31] hands or they showed up here just to
[1:05:34] give an amen to the almighty God. I
[1:05:37] guarantee you that there is something
[1:05:40] that is going to transpire. Now, this is
[1:05:42] where I'm at as a as a pastor, as a
[1:05:45] leader here, that if God would wake me
[1:05:48] up in the early mornings, if he would
[1:05:50] speak to me that there is an
[1:05:52] identification beyond the breakthrough,
[1:05:56] that we are identified in the
[1:05:58] breakthrough, then I could say and put
[1:06:01] my words with a prophet's words, and I
[1:06:03] would say that there's a breakthrough on
[1:06:06] the audience. What are you saying,
[1:06:08] brother Andrew? I am saying this that
[1:06:11] there is deliverance in this room
[1:06:13] tonight. There is a powerful
[1:06:17] powerful breakthrough upon the people
[1:06:19] today. And I believe this
[1:06:23] that you're going to have to tear off
[1:06:24] the roof to get to him.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; I guarantee you that you didn't just
[1:06:31] waste your gas money
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; so that I could see your pretty new
[1:06:35] dress. I guarantee you that you did not
[1:06:38] show up here so that I could see your
[1:06:40] new your new hairdo. I guarantee you
[1:06:42] that you didn't just show up in this
[1:06:44] room just so that you could be seen on
[1:06:46] the camera so somebody over in South
[1:06:49] Africa could see the way that you dress.
[1:06:52] I guarantee you you the reason why you
[1:06:54] showed up is because you wanted to get
[1:06:57] to Jesus.
[1:06:59] And there's going to have to come a time
[1:07:01] in your life when you've got to deny
[1:07:03] self.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; That you went to church just out of
[1:07:07] tradition. No, there was something a
[1:07:10] deep call to the deep that was bringing
[1:07:13] you that was bringing you. This is more
[1:07:16] than a tradition. It's your identity. It
[1:07:20] is attached with going to church.
[1:07:23] [Applause]
[1:07:28] But if you're going to get to him,
[1:07:31] you're going to have to silence the
[1:07:32] crowd on the outside
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; because there ain't no room in here.
[1:07:38] There's not enough room for your need in
[1:07:40] here. There's not enough space for your
[1:07:42] room in here because wherever Jesus is,
[1:07:46] the room is always packed out. The room
[1:07:48] is always full when Jesus is there. But
[1:07:52] be if you're going to get to him, you're
[1:07:54] going to have to break past the barrier
[1:07:56] of the crowd. The doorway was blocked.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine
[1:08:04] in the days of Jesus
[1:08:06] even put yourself in the 1960s
[1:08:10] and are trying to get to the prophet.
[1:08:13] They're literally squeezing their way
[1:08:15] in.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; They're literally squeezing their way
[1:08:18] into the doors just trying to get a seat
[1:08:20] in the I wonder if we would show up to
[1:08:23] church like that.
[1:08:26] I wonder if we would come to church like
[1:08:29] I wonder if we would worship like that.
[1:08:31] I wonder if we would truly get into a
[1:08:33] position that we've got to get to him no
[1:08:36] matter if I got to press through the
[1:08:38] crowd or I've got to silence the voices
[1:08:40] in the crowd. And I believe that too
[1:08:42] many times today that people are
[1:08:44] hindered by people's opinions. They're
[1:08:46] they're hindered by criticism. They're
[1:08:49] hindered by peer pressure. They are
[1:08:51] hindered by the air condition. They are
[1:08:53] hindered by the music's too loud. They
[1:08:55] are hindered by he's not my favorite
[1:08:57] preacher. They're hindered by they're
[1:08:59] they're they're just they're just
[1:09:01] they're worshiping way too loud.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; It's like a it's like an athlete
[1:09:12] and he's been told by the coaches and
[1:09:15] he's been told by everybody on his team
[1:09:18] that he won't be a starter.
[1:09:22] He's told him he's never going to make
[1:09:23] it, that he'll never be successful.
[1:09:27] But there's something on the inside of
[1:09:28] him.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; People's been telling him he's going to
[1:09:32] ride the bench and he never be up there.
[1:09:36] But if you're ever going to get to a
[1:09:38] position of successfulness, you are
[1:09:41] going to have to fight past your own
[1:09:43] fears. You're going to have to fight
[1:09:44] past other people's opinions. You're
[1:09:46] going to have to fight past what
[1:09:48] everybody else is saying. I'm like Paul
[1:09:50] said in Galatians 1:10, whether do I
[1:09:53] serve men or do I serve God? Am I going
[1:09:55] to please you or am I going to please
[1:09:57] God? Am I going to show up to church to
[1:09:59] please God or am I going to show up to
[1:10:01] church to please almighty God? I've got
[1:10:03] to come with that kind of tenacity, that
[1:10:06] kind of perseverance that I've got to
[1:10:08] get to Jesus. No matter if you don't
[1:10:10] want me to get to Jesus, if you don't
[1:10:11] want to worship, if you don't want to
[1:10:13] praise, if you don't want a
[1:10:14] breakthrough, I've got to come to that
[1:10:17] in my position. it because when you get
[1:10:19] desperate, it brings about a
[1:10:21] determination that you're going to get
[1:10:23] to him. And when you get that kind of
[1:10:25] desperate, determination takes over and
[1:10:28] determination births a miracle.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; Brother Man said it in the serpent seed.
[1:10:37] He said that's the reason that God is
[1:10:39] opening these things through us. That
[1:10:41] God is bringing his sons into
[1:10:42] manifestation. He's going beyond the
[1:10:45] human limitations of any human knowledge
[1:10:48] way into the spiritual revelations and
[1:10:51] he's bringing it down. You are either
[1:10:53] going to be identified with the
[1:10:54] outsiders or you're going to be
[1:10:56] identified with those that are willing
[1:10:58] to get into the house.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; Well, they got there first. If you get
[1:11:05] here first, you get in the church. Now,
[1:11:07] let me go on. The Bible was never
[1:11:09] written to show us only what God was and
[1:11:12] what God did in the past. But the Bible
[1:11:14] was written to show us who God is and
[1:11:17] what he wants to do in every single
[1:11:20] generation and everywhere on earth
[1:11:22] because he's the same yesterday, today,
[1:11:24] and forever. So the same way that he
[1:11:26] acted 2,000 years ago when they was
[1:11:29] trying to get into the house, he's got
[1:11:31] to act the same way today. Now remember
[1:11:33] said in Israel your life worthy of the
[1:11:35] gospel. He said that word is the truth.
[1:11:38] Right? And the spirit of God will
[1:11:40] recognize his own writing. He is
[1:11:42] identified by his writing. It speaks of
[1:11:45] him and you are identified by believing
[1:11:48] it. It gives you your credentials of
[1:11:52] identification.
[1:11:54] There are five steps of receiving a
[1:11:57] gift.
[1:11:59] One of them there's got to be a reason
[1:12:01] to give it. There's got to be a reason
[1:12:03] to receive it. There's got to there's
[1:12:05] got to be somebody that's going to give
[1:12:07] the gift. And then there's somebody's
[1:12:09] got to make the purchase of the gift.
[1:12:11] And then the very last one is the person
[1:12:14] that's got to accept the gift.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; You have got to come to a position where
[1:12:19] you accept
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; and believe that you are identified with
[1:12:24] this word.
[1:12:27] Therefore, Paul said, "Finally, my
[1:12:28] brethren, be strong in the Lord and in
[1:12:31] the power of his might." Now, remember,
[1:12:33] this is your identification. It is your
[1:12:36] credentials when you believe the word.
[1:12:38] Put on the whole armor of God that you
[1:12:40] might be able to stand against the ws of
[1:12:42] the devil. For we wrestle not against
[1:12:44] flesh and blood, but against
[1:12:46] principalities, against powers, against
[1:12:48] the rulers of the darkness of this
[1:12:50] world, against spiritual wickedness in
[1:12:52] high places. Wherefore take unto you the
[1:12:54] whole armor of God that you might be
[1:12:56] able to withstand in the evil day and
[1:12:59] having done all to stand. Can you
[1:13:01] identify yourself there? First John 4
[1:13:04] and4 says, "You are of God, little
[1:13:06] children, and have overcome them because
[1:13:08] greater is he that is he than he that is
[1:13:12] in you than he that is in the world."
[1:13:14] Can you identify yourself right there? 2
[1:13:18] Corinthians 3:5. Not that we are
[1:13:20] sufficient of ourselves to think of
[1:13:21] anything of ourselves, but our
[1:13:24] sufficiency
[1:13:26] sir,
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; my abilities, my breakthrough is of God.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; 2 Corinthians 12:9. And he said unto me,
[1:13:36] my grace is sufficient for thee, for my
[1:13:39] strength is made perfect in weakness.
[1:13:41] Most gladly therefore will I rather
[1:13:43] glory
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; in my infirmities that the power of
[1:13:49] Christ might rest upon me.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; I'd say that man of Pauly never thought
[1:13:56] of it like that.
[1:13:58] But today is going to be a little bit
[1:14:00] different.
[1:14:03] He had himself some they.
[1:14:06] I wonder if you have a they in your
[1:14:09] life.
[1:14:11] There's a lot of people that have a they
[1:14:15] say you'll never make it.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; They say you won't last. They say you
[1:14:21] can't live the message. They say you
[1:14:24] have went too far. They say that God had
[1:14:27] don't give the Holy Ghost no more.
[1:14:30] There's a whole lot of days out there.
[1:14:32] But I'm thankful to be identified with
[1:14:35] this kind of they they cared enough for
[1:14:38] me.
[1:14:39] They cared enough for me to get me into
[1:14:41] the room. They thought that he was
[1:14:44] powerful enough to get me into the room.
[1:14:46] They they they
[1:14:50] What kind of people are in your corner?
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; What kind of people are you listening
[1:14:55] to? Let me say if your friends are not
[1:14:58] putting you in the room where Jesus is,
[1:15:01] then drop your friends. Get rid of them.
[1:15:04] But identify yourself with this kind of
[1:15:07] a thing.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Isaiah 40 and 29. Can you
[1:15:17] identify with the word? He giveth power
[1:15:19] to the faint and to them that have no
[1:15:21] might. He increases strength. Even the
[1:15:24] youth shall faint and be weary and the
[1:15:27] young men shall utterly fall. Even when
[1:15:29] you think that you can make it, young
[1:15:31] men, even when you think that you can go
[1:15:33] on your own tenacity, when you think you
[1:15:35] can go in your own strength and you can
[1:15:37] live out this message on your own, God
[1:15:40] says he can't do it.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; But they,
[1:15:45] oh, hallelujah. But they, I'm identified
[1:15:49] as this kind of they that wait upon the
[1:15:52] Lord shall renew their strength.
[1:15:58] Hallelujah. They shall mount up with
[1:16:01] wings as eagles and they shall run.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; I'm identified as they
[1:16:09] shall walk and not faint.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; Isaiah 54:16.
[1:16:22] Behold, I have created the smith that
[1:16:24] bloweth the coals in the fire, that
[1:16:26] bringeth forth an instrument for his
[1:16:28] work, and I have created the waster to
[1:16:30] destroy. No weapon that is formed
[1:16:33] against thee shall prosper, and every
[1:16:36] tongue that shall rise against thee in
[1:16:39] judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the
[1:16:41] heritage of the servants of the Lord,
[1:16:44] and the righteousness is of me, saith
[1:16:47] the Lord. Revelations 12 and 10. And I
[1:16:50] heard a loud voice saying, "In heaven,
[1:16:53] now is come salvation, strength, and the
[1:16:55] kingdom of our God, and the power of his
[1:16:58] Christ. For the accuser of our brethren
[1:17:00] is cast down, which accused them before
[1:17:04] our God day and night." Right there is
[1:17:06] that day. They said you wouldn't make
[1:17:09] it. They said you wouldn't last. They
[1:17:11] said you couldn't live the message. They
[1:17:13] said it's them demons of hell that are
[1:17:16] putting that there. But you are not
[1:17:18] identified.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; You are identified in a breakthrough.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; And they
[1:17:34] and they overcame him by the blood of
[1:17:37] the lamb and by the word of their
[1:17:39] testimony. And they love not their lives
[1:17:42] under the death.
[1:17:47] Hallelujah.
[1:17:54] A man sat by a hospital room
[1:17:58] 38 years
[1:18:02] and he blamed it on they.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; I don't have no friends that have put me
[1:18:09] down in the water.
[1:18:11] Let me say if Jesus is your friend,
[1:18:13] forget they
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; forget them. But when Jesus shows up,
[1:18:18] there's a miracle that is getting ready
[1:18:20] to take place. You see, this man had
[1:18:23] laid there many a times. He had went
[1:18:25] through it. But this time, this morning,
[1:18:29] this moment, this chance, you see,
[1:18:32] you've got to be like Samgard in moments
[1:18:34] like this. That there are times in your
[1:18:36] life where you get beat up and the
[1:18:39] Philistines and the demons of hell come
[1:18:41] in and they robbed you year after year,
[1:18:43] day after day. Another Labor Day went by
[1:18:46] and you got robbed and you didn't get
[1:18:47] your blessing. But one day, Shamgar had
[1:18:50] his moment. One day, Shamgar was
[1:18:53] identified with a breakthrough. I'm not
[1:18:55] going back. I'm not letting them take my
[1:18:58] message. I'm not letting them take my
[1:18:59] joy. I'm not letting them take my peace.
[1:19:02] I'm not letting them take my family. I'm
[1:19:04] not letting them take my wealth. I'm not
[1:19:06] letting them take my spirit. I'm not
[1:19:07] letting them take my victory. I'm not
[1:19:09] letting them take my liberty. I'm not
[1:19:11] letting them take my dance. I'm not
[1:19:13] letting them take my shout.
[1:19:15] I Shanggar was identified with his
[1:19:18] breakthrough.
[1:19:21] There's two sides of Shangar. It depends
[1:19:24] what story you read.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; So read the rest of your story. Don't
[1:19:30] stop in the middle of it.
[1:19:35] [Applause]
[1:19:38] Brother would teach us in the greatest
[1:19:39] battle ever fought. He would lay in
[1:19:42] there that there we begin to watch when
[1:19:45] Lucifer de deceived onethird of the
[1:19:49] angels of heaven. You see, if you would
[1:19:52] stop right there in the story, you would
[1:19:54] think that the enemy had overcome
[1:19:57] almighty God. But God was going to use
[1:20:00] this to prove his attributes. And it
[1:20:04] looked like that those angelic battles
[1:20:07] that they were victorious there in
[1:20:08] heaven. And brother Brandham said that
[1:20:10] angelic battles came down from heaven
[1:20:13] and became human battles. He said sin
[1:20:16] did not originate here on earth. But
[1:20:18] where sin originated was right there in
[1:20:21] heaven. And we realize that there these
[1:20:24] spirits, these demonic powers, they lost
[1:20:27] their position, but they still have
[1:20:29] power. And these spirits are here with
[1:20:32] one purpose and that is to keep you from
[1:20:35] your breakthrough. It is to keep you.
[1:20:39] It is to keep you in the mindset, what
[1:20:42] if Jesus can't reach you? What if he's
[1:20:45] traveled on too far? What if you've went
[1:20:47] too far on God? Maybe you send away your
[1:20:50] day of grace. Maybe you looked at the
[1:20:53] wrong thing one too many times. One too
[1:20:56] many times. But I found out about my
[1:20:59] Lord Jesus. He's a God of first chances.
[1:21:02] He's a God of second chances. He's a God
[1:21:04] of third chances. Let me say this. None
[1:21:07] of us would be in this room if he wasn't
[1:21:10] the God of first and second and third
[1:21:12] and fourth chances.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; Brother Manam said, "I watched Adam and
[1:21:17] Eve as we're walking out of the Garden
[1:21:19] of Eden. I can hear him say it in the
[1:21:21] message of grace." He said, "There they
[1:21:23] were. She had all of her scientific
[1:21:25] knowledge, but there the fall came.
[1:21:29] There they were walking out on their
[1:21:31] own. No way back to Almighty God." Then
[1:21:34] I could hear the prophet say, "And then
[1:21:37] grace come breaking through."
[1:21:40] Oh, amazing grace. How sweet the sound
[1:21:44] that saved a wretch like me. What are
[1:21:48] you saying, Brother Andrew? I'm saying
[1:21:50] that young kids have got to come to a
[1:21:52] position where they tear the roof off.
[1:21:55] I'm saying that our young people have
[1:21:57] got to tear the roof off. I'm saying
[1:22:00] that you've got to push past what you
[1:22:02] think of yourself and what the devil
[1:22:04] thinks of you and what Christianity
[1:22:07] thinks of you.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; You're going have to tear the roof off
[1:22:12] of it.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; You say, "But I backslid, Brother
[1:22:18] Brandham." He said, "That don't make a
[1:22:20] bit of difference."
[1:22:23] He knows just exactly what you backslid
[1:22:25] over. He knows just exactly where you're
[1:22:28] at. You say, "Well, brother Random, I
[1:22:30] went off without him, too. I had an
[1:22:32] opportunity one time to speak. I had an
[1:22:34] opportunity one time to be a Christian.
[1:22:36] I had an opportunity. The preacher made
[1:22:38] the call and I went and I tried it once
[1:22:40] and I failed and I did this and I did
[1:22:41] that." No matter what you've done,
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; God has still got his eye on you.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; Those disciples went off without him one
[1:22:52] night and the darkest of hour. Then when
[1:22:55] that devil got them away from there,
[1:22:57] away from his presence. You see, that's
[1:23:00] what the devil is doing. He is looking
[1:23:02] for an entrance. When you leave his
[1:23:05] presence, that's where the disciples got
[1:23:07] in trouble. When Jesus went up on the
[1:23:10] mountain to pray, they should have went
[1:23:11] with him.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; But just because you went on without him
[1:23:18] doesn't mean he ain't seeing you.
[1:23:26] Now, I'm a Bible reader.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; And I've read this story many of times.
[1:23:34] This story does not is not one of the
[1:23:36] highlight stories for me that I remember
[1:23:38] Peter and the disciples for.
[1:23:41] Because that's not how I identify them.
[1:23:45] I identify them
[1:23:48] just like Jesus identified them on the
[1:23:51] day of Pentecost.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; How easy it is that we identify oursel
[1:23:57] by our failures and by our faults and by
[1:24:00] what other people say.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; But I am not identified by my faults nor
[1:24:06] my failures nor what other people say. I
[1:24:09] am identified by my breakthrough.
[1:24:13] Notice, you see, when his presence is
[1:24:15] with us, it shows that God's approval is
[1:24:18] on his life or on our lives. So, you
[1:24:21] could say, "I want his presence in me.
[1:24:24] His presence is going to bless me. I'm
[1:24:27] not leaving here until he blesses me
[1:24:30] like Jacob did." He's not identified as
[1:24:33] a sher. He's not identified as a liar.
[1:24:36] He's not identified as a man that could
[1:24:38] pull tricks. But he was identified as a
[1:24:41] man that pressed through that David is
[1:24:45] all and he wrestled it out and it was
[1:24:47] about the rising of the son that when
[1:24:49] the angel was wrestling with Jacob that
[1:24:52] his change came.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; That is where you identify Jacob at.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; But too many times you look on yourself
[1:25:04] and you see Jacob and you don't see
[1:25:06] Israel.
[1:25:08] Why is it? Because this old sticky
[1:25:11] nature that you got a hold of, this old
[1:25:14] flesh you got a hold of, it will hinder
[1:25:16] you all the days of your life, it will
[1:25:19] afflict you. It'll talk you into
[1:25:21] pleasing yourself more than pleasing
[1:25:23] God.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; But I want you to know this. Even though
[1:25:29] his booger is sticky and he likes to
[1:25:31] hang on to sticky things, there is given
[1:25:34] a power to the church of the living God
[1:25:37] to be able to override that sticky
[1:25:40] nature.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; I I'll just say it like brother Joe
[1:25:44] Green says it. I drink as much as I want
[1:25:46] to. I smoke as I want as much as I want
[1:25:49] to. I go out and I corouse as much as I
[1:25:51] want to. The difference between me and a
[1:25:54] lot of people is God took my one away.
[1:26:00] Come on, somebody. You can see the way I
[1:26:03] dance. You can see the way that I enjoy
[1:26:06] the Lord. I did that when I was out in
[1:26:08] sin, too.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; I went to the clubs. I went to Stanton.
[1:26:12] I danced all night long.
[1:26:16] You know why? Cuz I wanted to.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; But ever since a day in Canada, I never
[1:26:22] went in a club. I never went out in the
[1:26:24] streets. And I figured that if I could
[1:26:27] do that out there in the streets of
[1:26:29] Stanton, then I could surely do it in
[1:26:31] the house of God. The difference is I'm
[1:26:35] identified in my breakthrough. I'm not
[1:26:38] identified in my past.
[1:26:42] [Applause]
[1:26:50] Now when Jesus looks on this man,
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; he looks on him and he says, "Thy sins
[1:26:58] are forgiven thee." Now the prophet
[1:27:00] taught us what sin is. A lot of people
[1:27:02] look at sin as the things they do, the
[1:27:04] things they look at, the things they
[1:27:06] say. Those are attributes of sin. But
[1:27:09] the prophet told us what sin is. It's
[1:27:12] unbelief.
[1:27:14] ran him in a message persevering. He
[1:27:15] said he's dealing with a patient. He
[1:27:17] said, "Now you're ill. You've been to a
[1:27:19] doctor and he really would advise an
[1:27:20] operation. The operation is on the
[1:27:23] colon." That's true, isn't it? Here's
[1:27:25] another thing. You are desperately in
[1:27:27] need of a spiritual. You haven't been
[1:27:29] feeling right. You kind of feel a little
[1:27:31] washed away and little you want to come
[1:27:33] back. Well, you're back now.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; I didn't time that out, but that's
[1:27:39] pretty quick.
[1:27:42] Now, I can tell you by the grace of God,
[1:27:45] that by the blood of Jesus Christ that
[1:27:47] you're back, but a prophet had the
[1:27:50] ability to look into a person's life and
[1:27:52] say, "You've been looking, you've been
[1:27:54] searching, you've been wanting,
[1:27:57] and you've been wanting to get back for
[1:27:58] a long time." And he looks on the
[1:28:01] individual and says, "You're back now."
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; Now, who you going to listen to?
[1:28:11] You going to listen to they or you going
[1:28:13] to listen to an eagle anointing.
[1:28:16] You want it to come back. Well, you're
[1:28:19] back now
[1:28:22] that quick.
[1:28:23] You remember that old boy that was come
[1:28:25] off that little train ride, Sister
[1:28:27] Gabrielle? He was coming out there and
[1:28:29] he stood out there and he's looking at
[1:28:30] that he's looking at that water tower
[1:28:32] and things begin to remember. He begin
[1:28:34] to remember where he came from. He had
[1:28:36] he he was finding his identity. He'd
[1:28:39] been shell sharked like a lot of people
[1:28:42] had been shell sharked by sin. They have
[1:28:44] forgot what God ordained them to be. And
[1:28:47] here he was. He's looking at that water
[1:28:50] tower. One state, he doesn't know who he
[1:28:53] is. But one glance at the water tower,
[1:28:56] one glance at the smitten rock and it
[1:28:58] starts leading him back home. I say
[1:29:01] young people, I said no matter how far
[1:29:03] you went in God or how far you went away
[1:29:05] out in sin, if you can just take a look
[1:29:07] at this smitten rock and start looking
[1:29:09] and find out that your identity is not
[1:29:11] in the games of the world. It is not in
[1:29:14] the things of this layan age, but your
[1:29:17] identity is in the gene seed of almighty
[1:29:19] God that he placed on the inside of you
[1:29:21] before the foundation of the world
[1:29:23] before you could ever make a wrong
[1:29:25] mistake, before you can make a right
[1:29:27] choice.
[1:29:29] You are back now.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; Now go believe him with all your heart
[1:29:34] and you get well in Jesus Christ's name.
[1:29:36] Your sins are forgiven. Now watch a
[1:29:38] prophet. Now I didn't say it. I didn't
[1:29:42] say your sins are forgiven. He said
[1:29:44] that. It wasn't me. It was him.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; I don't want to hear a man say I'm
[1:29:50] forgiven. But I want to hear the father
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; again. And he would say, "Now sin cannot
[1:29:59] be covered by drinking, by casting it
[1:30:01] aside, by joining a church, by trying to
[1:30:03] do better. Sin can only be killed by the
[1:30:06] power of God, the blood of Jesus
[1:30:08] Christ." Wouldn't you want a life like
[1:30:10] that? If you would, you believe God is
[1:30:13] in the building. His never failing
[1:30:15] presence is always near, no matter where
[1:30:18] you go.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; It doesn't even matter what your last
[1:30:24] name is.
[1:30:26] That's right.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; There's grace for you. You remember the
[1:30:31] prophet had a son by the name of Billy
[1:30:33] Paul.
[1:30:35] Billy Paul was a young man.
[1:30:39] Brother Brandham come home from some
[1:30:40] meetings one time and he saw Billy out
[1:30:42] there and he was struggling.
[1:30:45] He got hanging out with the wrong crowd
[1:30:46] and he got smoking cigarettes. Brother
[1:30:49] Brandham called to him and said, "Billy,
[1:30:50] you doing all right?" She had to add
[1:30:52] them all doing okay. He said, "Billy,
[1:30:54] you know you're lying to me.
[1:30:56] He's you smoking them cigarettes. He
[1:30:58] said he said, "Daddy, I won't do it no
[1:30:59] more. I won't do it no more." Brother
[1:31:01] Brandham said he still kept on doing it.
[1:31:06] Brother Brandham said, "I I had a
[1:31:08] vision." And he said, "Billy Paul in
[1:31:11] this vision was just falling, falling,
[1:31:15] falling, and falling." He said, "I was
[1:31:17] screaming to him." And he wouldn't wake
[1:31:19] up. He wouldn't come to himself. He
[1:31:21] wouldn't do anything. He just kept
[1:31:22] falling and falling and falling. A
[1:31:24] little while later, Billy Paul was out
[1:31:26] playing. He got out there and he fell
[1:31:28] into some water and he got pneumonia.
[1:31:30] And the doctor give him a shot. And the
[1:31:32] doctor come to Brother Brandham said,
[1:31:33] "Brother Brandham said, I've killed your
[1:31:34] boy. I killed your boy." He said, he
[1:31:37] said, "Don't tell me that." He said,
[1:31:39] "I've been through so much. God, don't
[1:31:40] don't take my son. God, if there's still
[1:31:43] grace for Billy, God, would you turn
[1:31:46] this around?" He said, "And all of a
[1:31:48] sudden, a vision fell before my eyes."
[1:31:51] And he said there I saw Billy Paul
[1:31:53] falling falling kept falling. He kept
[1:31:57] falling. He said but the difference in
[1:31:58] this vision and that vision. He said in
[1:32:01] this vision there was two hands that
[1:32:03] come underneath of Billy Paul and it
[1:32:05] raised him back up. And he said before
[1:32:07] long I heard him saying daddy daddy
[1:32:10] daddy you see the difference between
[1:32:12] your fall and this side of glory is a
[1:32:16] new birth. Hallelujah. And this side of
[1:32:18] it, you are not identified with the one
[1:32:20] that has fallen, but you're identified
[1:32:22] with the God that is raising you back
[1:32:24] up.
[1:32:27] [Applause]
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; Convinced and concerned. He said the
[1:32:41] identity of the gospel being identified
[1:32:43] in you is when you see that you have
[1:32:46] passed
[1:32:50] from death unto life and become a new
[1:32:53] creature in Christ Jesus. That's the
[1:32:56] identity of the Holy Spirit
[1:32:59] when you pass
[1:33:02] from death
[1:33:04] unto life.
[1:33:07] So literally
[1:33:09] is where your identity is.
[1:33:12] That's the identity of the Holy Spirit
[1:33:14] is when you pass
[1:33:18] over Jordan, Sister Seb, it's when you
[1:33:22] pass, you know, now I I go overseas a
[1:33:25] little bit and I go to different
[1:33:26] countries and I'm carrying I'm carrying
[1:33:29] a a pack of an an identity card that
[1:33:32] wherever I go and and whenever I travel
[1:33:35] internationally now inside of the
[1:33:37] states, all I got to do is carry a
[1:33:38] little identity card that you get from
[1:33:40] DMV. has my driver's license. It's got a
[1:33:43] picture of me, but the picture is not of
[1:33:46] me as an old man, but it's a picture as
[1:33:48] of I am right now. It's not a picture of
[1:33:50] me when I was a little bitty child. It's
[1:33:52] a picture of me right now. Now, when I
[1:33:55] carry that passport, it's also got a
[1:33:57] picture in there. But this is there's a
[1:33:59] difference is is that this has been
[1:34:02] identified by the United States of
[1:34:04] America and it packs a seal of the
[1:34:07] United States upon it. And when I carry
[1:34:09] that passport with me and I'm going it
[1:34:13] it that passport is giving me of the
[1:34:15] ability to be able to go into new
[1:34:18] territories of where I've never been
[1:34:20] before. All because of this identity
[1:34:23] card and the seal of my government. It
[1:34:25] has given me access to be able to go
[1:34:28] into new territories. And when I get
[1:34:30] back to that border or to that customs
[1:34:33] agent, I can just simply show him my
[1:34:36] identity. He looks at my identity card
[1:34:38] and he looks at me and said, "You got to
[1:34:41] pass. You can come on through." You see,
[1:34:44] the difference between you and being
[1:34:46] able to walk into the kingdom of God is
[1:34:49] a seal of God's approval upon your life
[1:34:52] of the new birth. And when that new
[1:34:54] birth is there, you have the abilities
[1:34:56] to step into new territories and walk
[1:34:59] into a new land.
[1:35:01] your new birth.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; The reason why
[1:35:09] the reason why so many people
[1:35:12] struggle to express themsel in the land
[1:35:16] of the Holy Ghost is because they never
[1:35:19] found an altar.
[1:35:21] They have never found their way weeping
[1:35:23] their way back to Christ. Too many times
[1:35:26] people, they stay on the outside of a
[1:35:28] born-again experience and they come to
[1:35:30] church, they go to church, they read one
[1:35:33] scripture a day, and they stay the same
[1:35:35] way they ever was before.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; But that ain't my story.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; Now, if that's your story, there's a God
[1:35:48] that's still got the pen in his hand.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; The difference between me and you is I
[1:35:52] let God have the pen back.
[1:35:56] Hallelujah. I let him have the pen back
[1:35:59] because I was trying to write out my
[1:36:01] story, but God said, "No, I got
[1:36:04] something different for you.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; You are either going to let yourself
[1:36:13] write your own story and go to a devil's
[1:36:15] hell
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; or you're going to let God write your
[1:36:18] story.
[1:36:24] Hey, that's rough.
[1:36:26] No, I love you.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; I love you. I really do.
[1:36:31] Cuz I remember being right there, young
[1:36:34] man. I remember being right there. I had
[1:36:36] the world by the tail like a tiger, man.
[1:36:39] I had it. I Man, I wore my Superman
[1:36:40] shirt, bro. I I was glad about it. I was
[1:36:44] glad to wear it. I thought I was
[1:36:45] invincible. Me and Sister Mary and a few
[1:36:47] other of us here, we thought we was
[1:36:49] invincible. We did all kinds of stupid
[1:36:51] stuff. You know why? Cuz I stupid.
[1:36:57] The difference between me now and then,
[1:37:00] there's still a little bit of that
[1:37:01] stupidity there. But there's a new birth
[1:37:03] to make sure I don't do them stupid
[1:37:04] things.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; I ain't some great man. I don't have a
[1:37:12] great education. I don't have a I don't
[1:37:15] have a whole lot of money like the rest
[1:37:16] of the world does. But the major
[1:37:17] difference between me and Donald Trump,
[1:37:19] Joe Biden, and the Pope and Putin is I
[1:37:23] got something that the world can't have.
[1:37:25] I got something that changed my life. I
[1:37:28] got something that when I was in that
[1:37:30] trash bin and I was looking for when I
[1:37:33] was looking for potato chips.
[1:37:36] God said, "That's not your story. Give
[1:37:38] me the pen back. Give me the pen back.
[1:37:42] Give me the pen back."
[1:37:44] And I was like Jacob. I was wrestling it
[1:37:47] out. Why? Because the old man didn't
[1:37:50] want to die. But all of a sudden, I
[1:37:53] said, "I'm not going to let you go until
[1:37:55] you bless me
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; and it was noised."
[1:38:14] He was in the house.
[1:38:18] I'll be honest.
[1:38:21] I I wouldn't have known this unless I
[1:38:23] just done it. But I have preached over
[1:38:26] 700 sermons in 15 years.
[1:38:32] Only reason I know that is because I was
[1:38:34] messing around on my computer trying to
[1:38:35] move from one program to the next
[1:38:37] program and it said this is going to be
[1:38:40] a while.
[1:38:48] Just be thankful. I don't preach
[1:38:49] everything I have on my notes.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; There's a difference between me and a
[1:38:59] lot of preachers. I know when to stop
[1:39:02] because if you don't stop at the right
[1:39:04] time, baby, you are buying it back.
[1:39:07] Kind of like that farmer one time. Come
[1:39:10] in, sit down at church.
[1:39:12] Preacher kept on preaching. He just
[1:39:14] going away, going away. And all of a
[1:39:16] sudden, a farmer stands up. He said,
[1:39:18] 'Where are you going? He said, 'I got to
[1:39:19] go mow my hay. He said, ' Man, you
[1:39:21] should have done that before you come to
[1:39:22] church. He said, I didn't have to before
[1:39:24] church.
[1:39:26] That joker don't preach too long. God
[1:39:29] don't ever let me have that kind of
[1:39:31] reputation.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; But in 700 sermons,
[1:39:41] I'll give you my notes. I'll give you
[1:39:42] all my script. I'll give you all my
[1:39:43] scriptures and sermons.
[1:39:46] I'll give them to you.
[1:39:48] But none of them can preach as loud
[1:39:53] as your life.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; The reason is is because you decided to
[1:40:01] tear the roof off.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; You decided, you made up a decision in
[1:40:05] your mind. This message works. I'm going
[1:40:08] to live true to this message. I'm going
[1:40:10] I'm going to let it change my family.
[1:40:11] I'm going to let it change my life. I'm
[1:40:13] going to let it wash me. I'm going to
[1:40:14] let it make me new. I'm going to let it
[1:40:15] make me new be a new husband. I didn't
[1:40:17] know how to be a husband. I didn't know
[1:40:19] how to be a daddy. But the message
[1:40:21] taught me how.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; You know why? I watched it in my father
[1:40:26] and I watched it in my grandfather.
[1:40:27] Where did they get that from? The
[1:40:30] message.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; How'd you learn to be a business
[1:40:35] partner, a businessman? I learned it
[1:40:37] from the message. I put God first. I
[1:40:39] paid my tithe. I learned it from the
[1:40:41] message.
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; Where'd you learn to be a friend at? I
[1:40:45] learned it from the message.
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; I just decided that I got to tear the
[1:40:50] roof off
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; because I don't just need him every once
[1:40:54] in a while.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; And I don't just need him just on a
[1:40:57] Saturday night and a Sunday. I figured
[1:40:58] out a long time ago that I need Jesus
[1:41:01] because without Jesus, I am an old I'm
[1:41:04] an old wretched man. But give me Jesus.
[1:41:06] I'll tear the roof off and paralytics
[1:41:09] will walk. The deaf will hear. The blind
[1:41:11] will see. The dumb will speak.
[1:41:16] Take this whole world.
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; But let me tear the roof off.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; Now, this is the teacher of teachers.
[1:41:32] There's been Elijah.
[1:41:34] There's been Moses.
[1:41:36] There's been great prophets, major
[1:41:38] prophets, and minor prophets.
[1:41:41] But the Bible recorded that no man ever
[1:41:45] spake like this man, that even the winds
[1:41:48] and the waves obey him.
[1:41:52] So, we ought to pay close attention to
[1:41:54] what he's saying.
[1:41:57] Now, he's got something powerful about
[1:41:59] his voice
[1:42:01] because he has the ability to preach to
[1:42:04] five to 6,000 and set it out on such a
[1:42:08] panoramic that 5,000 people will start
[1:42:12] noising what Jesus is saying about the
[1:42:14] biatitudes. There's something special
[1:42:17] about his words and the way he says it.
[1:42:21] So, when he speaks, you begin to listen
[1:42:23] to him. I don't know if Jesus was
[1:42:26] sitting down crisscross or if he's
[1:42:28] sitting down at the table, sitting in a
[1:42:30] chair that many philosophers think that
[1:42:32] Jesus was the one that created the
[1:42:34] table. I don't know how he was sitting,
[1:42:37] but the prophet would say it. He said,
[1:42:39] "There he was." He said he was sitting
[1:42:42] there and he was teaching them the word.
[1:42:45] He said, "And all of a sudden the dust
[1:42:47] started to fall around him while he was
[1:42:50] teaching the word." You'd imagine
[1:42:54] he's created this dust, but there's
[1:42:57] something different about this. It's not
[1:43:00] from the ground. It's coming from above.
[1:43:04] And it actually stops Jesus in his
[1:43:06] tracks. It captures his attention.
[1:43:11] That's the kind of faith that this bride
[1:43:14] has that she has captured the anointed
[1:43:17] one's attention.
[1:43:22] There were four people that loved this
[1:43:23] boy.
[1:43:25] They'd watched Jesus heal the leper.
[1:43:27] They watched Jesus do mighty things. And
[1:43:30] Jesus is teaching.
[1:43:33] And Jesus is breathing. And Jesus is
[1:43:36] speaking. And Jesus has profound ways.
[1:43:42] And just about that time,
[1:43:44] somebody tears the shingles off.
[1:43:52] Now, you can either be identified
[1:43:55] with I've never walked before.
[1:43:58] You can either be identified as I got a
[1:44:01] little bit of shake in my hands.
[1:44:06] I got the pausy
[1:44:08] and I just can't live it right. And I I
[1:44:11] don't know if I can I don't know if I
[1:44:13] can really live this message or you can
[1:44:16] be identified
[1:44:18] as coming through the roof.
[1:44:21] I wonder what would happen today if all
[1:44:25] of a sudden the drywall started cracking
[1:44:29] and dust from the shingles and the
[1:44:30] gravel from it and the plywood and the
[1:44:33] splinter start coming off and all of a
[1:44:35] sudden there's four people standing on
[1:44:37] top of the roof and they're looking down
[1:44:39] on the Son of Man and all of a sudden
[1:44:42] they start lowering down their faith and
[1:44:45] they put their faith on the line and
[1:44:48] they put their friend right there where
[1:44:49] Jesus Jesus is
[1:44:57] now. You can be identified with somebody
[1:44:59] that's in the bed and stays in the bed.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; You can be identified as laying there in
[1:45:05] your sickness
[1:45:07] because sickness is a vehicle,
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; but it needs somebody to drive it.
[1:45:14] Spirits are a vehicle. They need
[1:45:16] somebody to drive it.
[1:45:19] And so they're looking for somebody that
[1:45:21] they could work their way into. How how
[1:45:24] they get in this building today is
[1:45:26] because somebody allowed a spirit to get
[1:45:29] here. Now, it's either God's spirit or
[1:45:32] it's an evil spirit. Brother Brandon
[1:45:34] would teach us about cancer. That
[1:45:36] cancer, he said it's simply just a a
[1:45:39] demon spirit. He said it's a spirit in a
[1:45:43] form. He said, "Then it goes to a bruise
[1:45:45] cell and then it takes on that form
[1:45:48] because it needs a body that it can work
[1:45:51] through. It simply needs the ability to
[1:45:54] be able to work in that body.
[1:45:58] But this man had somebody that cared
[1:46:02] enough for him even when he couldn't get
[1:46:05] to Jesus. when your prodals can't get to
[1:46:08] Jesus. There was somebody that listened
[1:46:11] to a token message and said, "You take
[1:46:14] that token and you apply it to by your
[1:46:17] faith upon your lost son and your lost
[1:46:20] daughter and you bring them back in."
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; This Pauly had found a body,
[1:46:31] but this Pauly was getting ready to lose
[1:46:34] its vehicle.
[1:46:36] Hallelujah. I'd be an upset human being,
[1:46:39] brother Chris. If I done drove my
[1:46:41] Corvette to church and man, it was
[1:46:43] looking fine out there and I get out
[1:46:45] there and somebody done took that
[1:46:46] rascal.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; I'd say it's them kind of service right
[1:46:51] now today.
[1:46:55] Satan, do you hear me?
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; You are losing the keys to your car.
[1:47:03] You are losing the keys to my mind. You
[1:47:06] are losing the key to my business. You
[1:47:09] are losing your key to my body. You are
[1:47:11] losing your key. You will not drive me
[1:47:14] from this place and that place. You will
[1:47:16] not drive me from fear to failure. You
[1:47:18] will not drive me from mistake to
[1:47:21] mistake. But I'm going to drive you
[1:47:23] right to the blood of Jesus Christ. I
[1:47:25] say get out of my car.
[1:47:29] Get out of my car.
[1:47:32] Get out.
[1:47:34] Hallelujah. It's an old song. It's an
[1:47:37] old song. Say, it says, "Don't do it.
[1:47:39] Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it.
[1:47:42] Don't do it. Don't." You know what I'm
[1:47:43] talking about, sister Seb? Maybe one day
[1:47:45] I we'll sing it together. Says, "Don't
[1:47:47] do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't
[1:47:50] do it. Don't do it. Don't do it." Then
[1:47:52] it goes on says, "Don't let the devil
[1:47:55] dry. You let him dry. He'll ruin your
[1:47:58] life. Don't do it.
[1:48:03] [Applause]
[1:48:06] I think you could do it a whole lot
[1:48:07] better than me, sis.
[1:48:11] Tell that devil, you taking the keys
[1:48:13] back.
[1:48:15] Tell that devil, you can't have my mind.
[1:48:17] You can't have my breakthrough. You
[1:48:19] can't have my body. You can't have my
[1:48:21] spirit. You can't have my joy. You can't
[1:48:23] have it. You can't have it. You can't
[1:48:25] have I tell you this. The devil thought
[1:48:27] he had me, but I got away from him.
[1:48:31] I got away.
[1:48:37] Now, Samson's got a powerful story.
[1:48:42] Samson
[1:48:45] Samson was known by his supernatural
[1:48:48] strength. He was s he was known by an
[1:48:51] extraordinary strength that was tied to
[1:48:54] his Nazerite vow. He was known for his
[1:48:56] feats of power and his feats of h of
[1:49:00] defeating conflicts of of the
[1:49:01] Philistines and conflicts with himself
[1:49:03] and he had conflicts with Delilah. But
[1:49:06] that was not his story. The final act of
[1:49:10] Samson's life is where he's identified
[1:49:12] at. You can look at his story and you
[1:49:15] can see all the faults. But then you
[1:49:17] could see the greatest victory came when
[1:49:19] he died to himself. When he is standing
[1:49:22] there, his identity came at the
[1:49:24] breakthrough of the threshing meal.
[1:49:29] Hannah,
[1:49:32] Hannah,
[1:49:33] do you hear me?
[1:49:35] Do you hear me? You are either going to
[1:49:38] be known or identified by baroness, by
[1:49:41] persecution,
[1:49:44] by mockery and bitterness, or you're
[1:49:46] going to give birth to a miracle.
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; Blind Barameus, do you hear me? You are
[1:49:55] either going to be identified as a blind
[1:49:57] man that was led around by a dove and
[1:50:00] led a lamb by led around by a lamb, or
[1:50:03] you're going to be identified
[1:50:07] as a man that decided today is the day.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; I'm going to scream out. I'm going to
[1:50:12] give my all. I'm going to press through.
[1:50:14] I'm not going to be identified as a
[1:50:15] blind man no more, but I'm going be
[1:50:17] identified as a man that saw Jesus with
[1:50:20] my very own eyes that he touched.
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; Walls of Jericho
[1:50:34] that I built up in my own mind.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; Do you hear me?
[1:50:40] Do you hear me?
[1:50:42] You're not going to be my identity.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; If these walls could talk,
[1:50:51] there's a reason why I'm on the outside.
[1:50:57] But just give me a moment with my
[1:50:59] Jehovah Savior.
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; And these walls won't be my identity
[1:51:04] much longer.
[1:51:08] You see, I got a cord hanging on the
[1:51:10] outside of these walls.
[1:51:12] And that's my identity. I once was no
[1:51:16] good. I once was a failure. I once let
[1:51:19] men into my life that robbed me and
[1:51:21] cheated me and steal from me and did all
[1:51:23] kind and they abused me. Amen.
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; If these walls could talk,
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; when you study
[1:51:37] Jewish tradition,
[1:51:39] you will find
[1:51:42] the reason why Rahab is in this
[1:51:44] condition
[1:51:47] is because of her mama and because of
[1:51:50] her daddy. They sold her into this
[1:51:58] Now, I don't have to have a raise of
[1:51:59] hands here, but I know some of you have
[1:52:02] been abused by your mom,
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; mentally, physically.
[1:52:08] I know some of you have been abused by
[1:52:10] your dad and other people in your life.
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; But this message is not holding that
[1:52:16] over you.
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; This message gives you access to grace.
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:25] Yeah, they did you wrong. Yeah, they
[1:52:27] hurt you. Yeah, they said wrong things.
[1:52:30] Yeah, they sold you into sin.
[1:52:33] But this is not a message of disgrace.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; It's a message of grace.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; I find it so amazing
[1:52:43] that the very first people that Rahab
[1:52:46] wants in her house is her mama and her
[1:52:48] daddy. Amen.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; You can either be broken by your past
[1:52:57] and let that be your identity.
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; Or you can allow the master
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; to mold the clay in such a way
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; that's right.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; They said, "God, they did me wrong, but
[1:53:09] I don't want them to miss the rapture."
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; What kind of breakthrough did Joshua
[1:53:17] give to her?
[1:53:27] Hallelujah.
[1:53:29] Hallelujah.
[1:53:32] Dryness. Do you hear me?
[1:53:35] I ain't seen a raindrop in three and a
[1:53:38] half years.
[1:53:42] The only time I ever felt any refreshing
[1:53:45] was cuz a little be a women widow woman
[1:53:47] up there.
[1:53:49] was decided she was going to take care
[1:53:51] of me.
[1:53:52] But do you hear me, Donus?
[1:53:55] Today, my spirit's going to be
[1:53:58] refreshed. Today, I'm coming to a
[1:54:01] position where I'm going to be
[1:54:03] refreshed. Dryness, do you hear me?
[1:54:07] I don't see any signs of a pouring out
[1:54:10] of the Holy Spirit yet.
[1:54:13] But you will not be my identity. that
[1:54:15] there was not enough water to go around.
[1:54:19] But do you hear me? I'mma pray.
[1:54:22] I'mma pray. No way. It's still dry in
[1:54:25] this air. No. I'mma pray. I'mma pray.
[1:54:29] No. No. No. It stay right there. They
[1:54:32] ain't came back to the house of God yet,
[1:54:34] so I'm going to pray again. They ain't
[1:54:36] forgave me yet, so I'm going to pray
[1:54:37] again. I I haven't felt the anointing
[1:54:39] yet, but I'm I'm going to pray again. I
[1:54:40] I ain't felt my breakthrough yet, so I'm
[1:54:42] I'm going to pray again. You know what?
[1:54:44] I I feel like I'm turning a corner,
[1:54:46] though. I feel like I'm I I feel like
[1:54:48] I'm I feel like I'm getting ready to see
[1:54:50] something manifest, but I'm going to
[1:54:52] pray again. Even though I feel like it's
[1:54:54] coming, even though I I know it's close,
[1:54:56] I'm going to pray again. I'm I'm going
[1:54:57] to press through. I'm going I'm going to
[1:54:59] pray even though I don't feel like
[1:55:00] praying. I my knees are hurting. I don't
[1:55:02] I don't even have enough strength to
[1:55:03] climb the heel. I I got to send other
[1:55:05] people up there to even go up there to
[1:55:07] Full Gospel Lighthouse and tell me
[1:55:08] whether God's real or God's not. And and
[1:55:10] I I I just I got to pray.
[1:55:17] Ahab, get down there because I see a
[1:55:21] cloud like the size of a man's hand.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; Why? Because Elijah decided to press
[1:55:28] through.
[1:55:29] [Applause]
[1:55:34] Hallelujah.
[1:55:37] Hallelujah.
[1:55:40] Hallelujah.
[1:55:44] The law
[1:55:47] won't hold me back no longer.
[1:55:50] Fear won't hold me back no longer.
[1:55:53] Circumstances won't hold me back no
[1:55:56] longer.
[1:55:58] My money that I've wasted won't hold me
[1:56:01] back no longer.
[1:56:04] I got to get to Jesus.
[1:56:07] He's the only hope that I have left.
[1:56:16] I wonder how many people heard Homer
[1:56:18] Frazzia preach
[1:56:20] and they didn't get to Jesus. I wonder
[1:56:23] how many people heard Ron Spencer preach
[1:56:26] and they didn't get to Jesus. I wonder
[1:56:28] how many people have heard these fine
[1:56:31] brothers minister
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; and they didn't get to Jesus.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; Don't let that be your story.
[1:56:42] She's 12 years old.
[1:56:46] She's about to die.
[1:56:49] But I got to get to him.
[1:56:52] I got these priestly robes on.
[1:56:57] But I got to get to him. I'm probably
[1:56:59] going to get kicked out of the
[1:57:01] denominations
[1:57:03] cuz if I if I go there,
[1:57:06] if I get close to him, if I draw near to
[1:57:08] him,
[1:57:11] they're going to identify me with him.
[1:57:14] But I got to get to him.
[1:57:20] I wonder what really is holding you
[1:57:22] back.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; I wonder what's really Is it the fear
[1:57:27] factor?
[1:57:29] of what other people think about you. Or
[1:57:31] is it really you?
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; Obviously with Darius, it was not what
[1:57:42] other people thought of him. But you
[1:57:44] see, he doesn't give it up.
[1:57:47] And he had a man come to him said,
[1:57:48] "Don't trouble the master no more. She's
[1:57:52] done dead."
[1:57:54] And I got a powerful quote I want to
[1:57:55] read to you right here. Now watch, watch
[1:57:57] what brother Brandham says here.
[1:58:00] He said, "Now, but in that Lord Jesus,
[1:58:04] he was possessed with a power that went
[1:58:07] beyond earthbound limitations. He walked
[1:58:10] over that cold, still formed dead girl."
[1:58:13] Now Jarius don't care what people say.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; He's done shed his priestly groves.
[1:58:21] He don't care what the crowd said about
[1:58:22] him. He doesn't even care what the
[1:58:24] messenger said about his girl.
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; He's walking with a master.
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; He walked over there to that cold still
[1:58:33] form of a dead girl. Oh, hallelujah. And
[1:58:36] he took her by the hand and he looked
[1:58:38] around and said, "Where is everybody?"
[1:58:41] They're outside
[1:58:44] making fun, criticizing everything. He
[1:58:46] was possessed with the power that he
[1:58:48] could speak into another world. And he
[1:58:50] began to speak in tongues and said
[1:58:52] talikumi that his soul returned back to
[1:58:56] this little girl. Hallelujah.
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; Now there's getting ready to be a
[1:59:02] change.
[1:59:06] I don't know her name, but Jarius did.
[1:59:10] And I don't know your prodal's name, but
[1:59:13] you do.
[1:59:15] But the difference is that the master
[1:59:17] knows
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; and the master has come into this room
[1:59:22] to bring them back to life.
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; And I want you to know the master is
[1:59:27] here.
[1:59:29] He is here in power and in demonstration
[1:59:32] to make sure that you get up out of your
[1:59:35] deadness because he's come here today to
[1:59:38] quicken you to get you out of your
[1:59:40] stuper to get you out of your ideas of
[1:59:43] you can't go no more and you can't go on
[1:59:45] this way and I I don't know if I can go
[1:59:47] or not but I want to so I want to
[1:59:50] Hallelujah. I want to give this to you
[1:59:52] church. He said he gave that same power
[1:59:56] to his church.
[1:59:59] Now lay your hands over on one another.
[2:00:07] Shamgar,
[2:00:08] Samson, Hannah,
[2:00:11] Elijah, blind Barnameus,
[2:00:17] Jarius,
[2:00:20] Zenian woman.
[2:00:24] He laid his hand over on that dead body
[2:00:28] and said, "So, return back to hear this
[2:00:31] little girl." Hallelujah.
[2:00:34] He gave that same power to his church.
[2:00:37] That when you're forsaken and downcast,
[2:00:40] God give us a language to speak out into
[2:00:42] another world. That when Jesus was
[2:00:44] forsaken on the cross and all man had
[2:00:47] forsaken him, he died speaking in
[2:00:49] another language. My God, why hast thou
[2:00:52] forsaken me? And the church tonight is
[2:00:55] possessed with that kind of a power.
[2:01:01] You have the power to lay your hands on
[2:01:03] the sick and they shall recover.
[2:01:09] There are people that come to church
[2:01:11] that don't even want to come to church.
[2:01:15] There are people that love coming to
[2:01:16] church.
[2:01:18] There are people that have needs. There
[2:01:20] are people that love the Lord and they
[2:01:22] still need a touch from the master
[2:01:25] and it's been noised abroad this morning
[2:01:28] that he's in the house.
[2:01:31] Won't you let the master touch you?
[2:01:35] I wonder what you're going to tear off
[2:01:38] this morning.
[2:01:40] I wonder what's in your way. I wonder
[2:01:42] what's really holding you back.
[2:01:45] A lot of people it's sports.
[2:01:48] A lot of people it's their ideas. A lot
[2:01:50] of people it's what they want to do. I'm
[2:01:53] not the man that makes up what the
[2:01:56] shingle is.
[2:01:58] You know what the shingle is.
[2:02:05] But I want to
[2:02:08] remind you about a man of God that came
[2:02:11] here two years ago and preached on a
[2:02:13] sermon called tile wreckers.
[2:02:16] You're either going to be a tie wrecker.
[2:02:18] You're going to be identified as
[2:02:19] somebody that breaks through. Or you're
[2:02:21] going to be identified with somebody
[2:02:22] that didn't have the courage to get up
[2:02:25] and come to an altar and make things
[2:02:28] right.
[2:02:31] Do you realize his presence is here
[2:02:34] to change your identity?
[2:02:39] Father,
[2:02:41] these children have their hands laid
[2:02:43] over on your masterpieces that you
[2:02:45] created.
[2:02:47] They are here. They have desired that
[2:02:49] you would come and manifest your glory
[2:02:51] to them. And Lord Jesus, I invite you
[2:02:54] just now to come and manifest your ways
[2:02:58] through your people. Lord God, we can
[2:03:00] see the limbs as they begin to struggle
[2:03:02] and they begin to they begin to have
[2:03:04] life come to them and they begin to bow
[2:03:06] in the wind. What is it? The earth is
[2:03:09] groaning and it's testifying to us that
[2:03:12] there is a people that is on the edge of
[2:03:15] a breakthrough of a rapture. But
[2:03:17] almighty God, may you come and break in
[2:03:19] through this room just now. And may you
[2:03:21] just push us past our fears. Lord, I
[2:03:24] pray that you would just come in a
[2:03:25] supernatural way and you would charge
[2:03:27] us. Lord, I pray that today as we begin
[2:03:31] to unite our faith, our hands are laid
[2:03:33] over on one another. I pray God that you
[2:03:35] would take control of this body of
[2:03:37] believers and you would begin to
[2:03:39] manifest your glory right here, right
[2:03:41] now, oh God. And that we would tear off
[2:03:44] the roof and you would begin to lower us
[2:03:47] into a position that we would see the
[2:03:49] son of man with his hand looking upon us
[2:03:52] saying, "Rise up and walk."
[2:03:55] So, Father,
[2:03:57] I pray this blessing over your people
[2:03:59] today
[2:04:01] that they would rise to walk in a
[2:04:03] newness of life.
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; And may the Father rejoice that there
[2:04:08] was somebody that got up out of their
[2:04:10] bed.
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; Father, I pray God that all of the
[2:04:14] heavens would begin to rejoice because
[2:04:18] one sinner begin to repent and begin to
[2:04:20] turn back to you, Father.
[2:04:23] Lord Jesus, our eternity
[2:04:26] can be defined by this moment
[2:04:33] in Jesus Christ's name.
[2:04:36] Amen.
[2:04:39] Let the musicians come.
[2:04:59] I won't be stopped
[2:05:03] by walls.
[2:05:05] I won't be stopped by crowds.
[2:05:08] I won't be stopped by silence. And I
[2:05:11] won't be stopped by shame.
[2:05:23] I see giant killers out here.
[2:05:29] &gt;&gt; Now, parents,
[2:05:31] you can either keep them back there on
[2:05:33] the backside hurting sheep or you can
[2:05:36] let them go.
[2:05:44] I say every one of these young people
[2:05:46] deserve a rock.
[2:05:51] &gt;&gt; Let's give them a rock.
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; Let's give them a rock.
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; I see some Davids out there that deserve
[2:06:01] a rock.
[2:06:02] Let's give them a rock.
[2:06:05] I don't know whether you can accept it
[2:06:07] or not, but these young people one day
[2:06:10] in their life are going to be known as
[2:06:12] giant killers.
[2:06:14] That's right.
[2:06:14] &gt;&gt; Whether you accept it or not, I choose
[2:06:17] to believe that on the inside of these
[2:06:20] boys is giant killers, is serpent
[2:06:24] bruisers.
[2:06:25] I choose to believe
[2:06:29] that if people will walk away from this
[2:06:31] message that God's got people that'll
[2:06:34] stand right here. Let's give them a
[2:06:36] rock.
[2:06:38] Let's give them a rock.
[2:06:48] &gt;&gt; Now you've been practicing.
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; You've been practicing.
[2:06:54] been back there and he killed a line. He
[2:06:58] killed that besetting sin.
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; He killed the fear of being in front of
[2:07:04] people.
[2:07:09] &gt;&gt; Now it's time for a public show.
[2:07:13] &gt;&gt; You've been reading the Bible. You've
[2:07:15] been listening to the tapes.
[2:07:18] And now it's time.
[2:07:23] I won't give you a rock.
[2:07:26] Now, before you ever got in this valley,
[2:07:29] them rocks was already there.
[2:07:33] Before Goliath ever come down off of his
[2:07:35] side of the hill,
[2:07:38] them rocks was already there.
[2:07:41] Before Saul made a choice he wasn't
[2:07:43] going down there, them rocks was already
[2:07:46] there.
[2:07:48] What made the difference in David and
[2:07:51] the rest of them was his identity was
[2:07:55] known as picking up a rock.
[2:07:58] There's a lot of people that have chose
[2:08:00] not to pick up this rock and to sling it
[2:08:02] at the devil.
[2:08:04] But I want to give you the courage to
[2:08:06] know
[2:08:07] &gt;&gt; that if you can pick up this rock,
[2:08:10] &gt;&gt; it'll kill every Goliath. It'll kill
[2:08:12] every giant. It'll kill every spirit.
[2:08:14] It'll kill every anxiety. It'll kill
[2:08:16] depression. It'll kill. It'll kill.
[2:08:18] It'll kill.
[2:08:21] But I want to ask you a question. Do you
[2:08:23] have the courage?
[2:08:25] [Applause]
[2:08:27] Do you have the courage to grab this
[2:08:30] rock?
[2:08:31] [Music]
[2:08:37] It just comes to my mind just now.

[2:08:43] Alamo.

[2:08:55] it's a good chance we're going to die
[2:08:57] right here today.
[2:09:00] If you're you're free to go if you want
[2:09:02] to.
[2:09:04] We got the whole Mexican army out there
[2:09:06] coming down on us.
[2:09:09] He said, "But you that want to stay with
[2:09:11] this army,
[2:09:13] I'm going to draw a line in the sand.
[2:09:19] And you that come on this side of it
[2:09:23] will show me
[2:09:27] that you're willing to fight with me."
