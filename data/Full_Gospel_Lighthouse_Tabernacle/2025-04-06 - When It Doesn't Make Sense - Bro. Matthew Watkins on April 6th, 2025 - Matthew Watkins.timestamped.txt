[21:52] lead us to the throne of
[21:55] grace. Amen. Let's bow our heads and our
[21:59] hearts. Dear sweet kind heavenly father.
[22:02] Lord we thank you Lord Jesus for this
[22:04] opportunity Lord to come and to speak to
[22:07] you our loving
[22:09] savior. Lord truly how deep the father's
[22:12] love is for us.
[22:13] that Lord, while we were yet sinners,
[22:16] Lord, you died for
[22:18] us because, Lord Jesus, we came from God
[22:21] and we're going to go back to God. Lord,
[22:24] how we thank you, Lord, for everything
[22:27] that you've done for us and all your
[22:28] blessings on our lives. Lord, we just
[22:30] want to offer an offering of
[22:32] thanksgiving, Lord. Father, we all have
[22:35] requests and we all have needs in our
[22:37] lives. But Lord, before we even bring
[22:39] those to you, we just want to thank you,
[22:41] Lord, for everything you've already
[22:43] done. Thank you for the miracle of
[22:45] another day, Lord, that we can be here,
[22:48] Father, in your presence to hear your
[22:50] word. Thank you, Lord, for protecting us
[22:52] this week, Lord, and all the many
[22:55] attacks of the enemy, but yet you many
[22:57] of them we may even be so unaware of,
[22:59] but yet in another dimension, your
[23:01] angels are always encamping about us.
[23:04] Lord, the footsteps of the righteous are
[23:06] ordered of the Lord. And many times we
[23:08] take paths that we don't understand or
[23:10] don't even know why we're there. But
[23:12] Lord, if we could only lean on the
[23:14] scripture, Lord, that they are ordained
[23:16] of the
[23:17] Lord. Lord, what confidence that gives
[23:20] us and what faith, Lord, in a father
[23:22] that knows all things. Lord, how we love
[23:25] you and we thank you for all that you do
[23:27] for us. We thank you that there's a
[23:29] blood that can cleanse us from all sin.
[23:32] Lord, not only cleanse us from sin, but
[23:34] Father, to heal us, to fill us with your
[23:37] Holy Spirit, Lord, that you just didn't
[23:39] leave it to the ways of man, but you
[23:41] sent your Holy Spirit to come, the very
[23:43] life, the very literal life of Jesus
[23:46] Christ to come to be working in an end
[23:47] time. Lord, when we live in such an age,
[23:50] Lord, of deceit, we live in an age of so
[23:52] many voices and sin all
[23:54] around. Yet, you have a body of
[23:57] believers that lives above sin. a body
[24:01] of believers, a spotless, a sinless
[24:03] bride. Lord, how we thank you, Lord,
[24:05] that we can live above sin, that we can
[24:07] live in perfection, Lord, not in the
[24:09] perfection of our own humanity, that
[24:12] you've made a way. And we thank you,
[24:13] Father. Lord, we lift up every prayer
[24:16] request to you, Lord. Those in the
[24:17] hospitals, Lord, and those in great need
[24:19] of you, Lord. We just lift them up to
[24:21] you, Lord, and ask that you give them a
[24:23] a touch. Send forth your spirit, Lord,
[24:25] and make a way in their situation.
[24:28] Lord, we thank you for the wonderful
[24:29] report, Lord, that we've heard for
[24:31] Brother Ron. And Father God, we're just
[24:33] going to trust you for more. Lord, have
[24:36] you seen each hand that was raised? We
[24:37] just pray that you meet each and every
[24:39] need. Touch the lives, Lord, behind that
[24:41] hand. Lead us and guide us into your
[24:43] word, Father. And we just ask your
[24:45] blessings over this service. Bless
[24:47] Brother Matthew as he brings forth the
[24:48] word. We thank you for the word that we
[24:50] heard last night, but Father, we ask
[24:52] that you anoint them a fresh, Lord, for
[24:54] we need a fresh word this morning. We
[24:56] need more of you, Lord. Lord, and we
[24:57] just ask that you bless him in a special
[24:59] way. Bless this service, Lord, for your
[25:01] honor and your glory. We love you and we
[25:03] commit this service into your hands in
[25:04] Jesus Christ's name.
[25:08] Amen. Thank you, brother William. Amen.
[25:11] As they receive this morning's offering,
[25:13] we're going to have Sister Faith Miller,
[25:15] as she prepared to come sing for us this
[25:16] morning. And we'll have Sister uh Beth
[25:19] Robinson come sing. Amen. Maybe we sing
[25:22] that song as they're preparing to come
[25:23] receiving the offering this morning.
[25:24] I've decided to take a stand.
[25:27] Tell somebody
[25:29] say I
[25:31] decided to take a
[25:35] stand not believing I might lose my best
[25:40] friend.
[25:43] Oh, but I'd
[25:46] rather Well, I'd rather be
[25:51] right. There
[25:53] he and lift up my
[25:58] eyes.
[25:59] Walk
[26:04] just
[26:06] stay till somebody says sing it again.
[26:12] the line beside
[26:15] it to take a
[26:19] stand. Will he not believe me? I might
[26:24] lose my best
[26:28] friend. Will hide right
[26:37] through. Then you
[26:40] hear lift up my
[26:45] eyes. Oh, God's children just
[26:51] stay.
[26:53] Stay until somebody say you
[26:59] stand.
[27:01] Stand for holy day.
[27:05] Stand before
[27:07] righteousness and
[27:11] beyond that with
[27:15] me and you stay with all your
[27:19] [Music]
[27:28] grace. Oh, listen and stand again.
[27:35] [Music]
[27:38] stand righteousness this
[27:45] morning that should be
[27:49] redeemed and you
[27:51] stay all your friends are
[27:56] going when you're all
[27:59] alone we shall receive
[28:02] [Music]
[28:07] Amen. God bless you. You can be seated.
[28:28] What do you say to
[28:30] someone who feels like they've lost it
[28:34] all over the edge with no one there to
[28:39] break their
[28:43] fall? And what do you say to
[28:47] someone who feels so
[28:51] unloved giving themselves away a little
[28:55] bit every day just to be good enough?
[28:59] [Music]
[29:01] What do you say to a hopeless soul who
[29:06] can't remember their way home and
[29:11] everything is out of their
[29:16] control? There is no
[29:21] valley. There is no darkness.
[29:26] There is no
[29:29] sorrow greater than the grace of
[29:34] Jesus. There is no
[29:38] moment. There is no
[29:43] disance. There is no
[29:47] heartbreak. He can't take you through.
[29:54] So before you think that you're too lost
[29:58] to
[30:01] save,
[30:03] remember there is nothing greater than
[30:07] grace.
[30:13] What do you say to
[30:16] someone whose life is on the
[30:20] line and they're unsure what happens
[30:25] after their last
[30:29] breath? And what do you say to some
[30:34] who's built a wall you can't break
[30:38] through? And it's so hard for them to
[30:43] hear the
[30:46] truth. There is no
[30:51] valley, there is no
[30:55] darkness, there is no
[30:59] sorrow greater than the grace of Jesus.
[31:05] There is no
[31:09] moment. There is no
[31:13] distance. There is no
[31:17] heartbreak. He can't take you through.
[31:25] So before you think that you're too lost
[31:29] to
[31:32] save, remember there is nothing greater
[31:37] than grace.
[31:39] [Music]
[31:43] So don't lose
[31:46] hope and don't let
[31:51] go and don't give
[31:55] up and you are not
[32:01] alone. There is no valley.
[32:07] There is no
[32:10] darkness. There is no
[32:14] sorrow greater than the grace of
[32:19] Jesus. There is no
[32:24] moment. There is no
[32:28] distance. There is no
[32:32] heartbreak. He can take you through.
[32:39] So before you think that you're too lost
[32:44] to
[32:45] [Music]
[32:47] save. So before you think that you're
[32:52] too lost to
[32:56] save,
[32:57] remember there is nothing
[33:03] greater than grace.
[33:07] [Music]
[33:10] [Applause]
[33:37] [Music]
[33:50] In a deep dark cave of trouble, a soul
[33:53] will send in distress. Evil whispered in
[33:57] my
[33:58] ear. You'd be left for dead in the trial
[34:03] of my life. All I could do was cry. Then
[34:08] suddenly God breathed in me a second
[34:12] wind of
[34:14] tri. And I live to tell about it. I live
[34:19] to
[34:20] testify. I live to tell about him. Let
[34:25] God be glorified. Satan's plans to
[34:29] destroy me. Backfired like
[34:33] dynamite. Gave me a testimony. I shall
[34:37] live and not die. For a moment things
[34:41] looked hopeless. I thought I would not
[34:44] survive, but I live to tell about it.
[34:48] Yes, I live to
[34:53] [Music]
[34:55] testify. Say you did not do your
[34:58] homework when you chose me to harass.
[35:02] You see, I was a born again just
[35:04] yesterday. I've been tested in the past
[35:08] and I know just how you work. How all
[35:12] you do is lie. I will not be deceived. I
[35:17] know the way, the truth, the
[35:21] lies. And I live to tell about it. And I
[35:26] live to
[35:27] testify. I live to tell about him. And
[35:32] let God be glorified. Satan's plans to
[35:36] destroy me. Back out like
[35:40] dynamite. He gave me a testimony. I
[35:44] shall live and not die. For a moment
[35:48] things looked hopeless. I thought I
[35:51] would not survive, but I live to tell
[35:55] about it. Yes, I live to testify.
[36:00] saying you did not do your homework when
[36:04] you chose me to harass. You see, I
[36:07] wasn't born again just yesterday. I've
[36:10] been tested in the past and I know just
[36:14] how you work, how all you do is lie. I
[36:19] will not be deceived. I know the way,
[36:23] the truth, the
[36:25] life, and I live to tell about it. And I
[36:30] live to
[36:31] testify. I live to tell about him. Let
[36:36] God be glorified. Satan's plans to
[36:40] destroy me. Blackfire like
[36:44] dynamite. Gave me a testimony. I shall
[36:48] live and not die. For a moment things
[36:52] looked hopeless. I thought I would not
[36:56] survive. But I live to tell about it.
[37:00] Yes, I live to
[37:03] testify. And you live to tell about it.
[37:07] And you live to
[37:09] testify. You live to tell about him. And
[37:14] let God be glorified. Satan's plans to
[37:18] destroy you backfired like
[37:21] dynamite. He gave you a testimony.
[37:25] You shall live and not die. For a moment
[37:30] things looked hopeless. I thought you
[37:33] would not survive. But you've lived to
[37:36] tell about it. Yes, you've lived to
[37:39] testify.
[37:52] [Music]
[37:59] testify.
[38:01] Hallelujah. What a blessing.
[38:07] How about Jesus singing that song? I
[38:09] live to tell about it. I come up out of
[38:12] the grave. My, you know, sometimes a
[38:15] song is just right. But when the person
[38:18] behind it singing the song, if you knew
[38:20] their testimony,
[38:21] [Music]
[38:22] we lived to tell about it, didn't we,
[38:24] sis? Glory be to God. And why don't you
[38:26] give the Lord a hand clap of
[38:28] praise?
[38:30] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Blessed be the
[38:32] name of the Lord. Amen. Well, blessed be
[38:37] the name of the Lord. What a wonderful
[38:38] Sunday morning the Lord has given us
[38:40] today. Didn't we have a wonderful time
[38:42] in the Lord last night? My the word of
[38:44] the Lord was so rich and it blessed our
[38:46] hearts and we just uh are looking
[38:48] forward to what God has in store for us
[38:50] this morning. And we have brother Matt
[38:53] Watkins here. We're just asking the Lord
[38:54] to use him in a in a supernatural way as
[38:57] we know that he will. And uh we're just
[39:00] looking under the Lord. We want to uh um
[39:03] make mention we got a few uh visitors

[47:17] thankful you are.
[47:22] Give him a hand for the praise of all.
[47:41] Yes. Isn't he awesome? Isn't he an
[47:43] awesome God? Oh, don't you just love
[47:45] that presence that you feel? My
[47:48] goodness. I just want to say this is
[47:49] what I was made for. This is what I was
[47:52] made to be. And man, you go out there in
[47:54] the world and you got the pressure of
[47:55] life and trouble and struggle and and
[47:58] work and bills and raising and family
[48:01] and but you know what? I don't fit in
[48:03] out there. But when I get in this kind
[48:05] of a presence, I realize this is where I
[48:08] came
[48:08] from because this is when I feel the
[48:11] most at home to say, Lord, if I could
[48:13] dissect like David said, you know, you
[48:15] might seek money and that might be good
[48:17] for you. You might have you might have
[48:18] sought a career and some great education
[48:21] and degree and hey maybe that's what
[48:23] fills you up. But David said one thing
[48:26] have I desired in my whole life and that
[48:29] will I seek after to dwell to live to
[48:33] abide in the presence of the Lord all
[48:36] the days of my oh how many feel that
[48:38] way? Lord there's one thing the world
[48:40] might be chasing but there's one thing
[48:41] I'm chasing this morning to live in that
[48:44] presence all the days of my life.
[48:47] Oh, to to to inquire of the Lord to in
[48:50] his temple. Amen. God bless you. Well,
[48:53] it's just such an honor once again to be
[48:55] here with you and I appreciate so much
[48:57] the just the presence of the Lord that
[48:59] we feel this morning. Amen. Believe that
[49:01] he has something special. Amen. I just I
[49:04] just hope and pray that something was
[49:06] said last night that would encourage
[49:08] you. Amen. And was able to to to to give
[49:12] you faith not just to stand up, but to
[49:14] beat that bully. That's right. Amen. My
[49:17] goodness. I thought if there was ever a
[49:19] man who gets up every single morning and
[49:21] beats that bully up, it's Brother Ron
[49:23] Spencer. Every day of his life, he gives
[49:26] that bully a
[49:28] whapon.
[49:31] Hallelujah. My
[49:34] goodness. Praise the name of the Lord.
[49:36] It's such an honor once again to be here
[49:38] with you and and I just want to say how
[49:40] much I've appreciated all the
[49:42] hospitality and fellowship and my my cup
[49:45] is full. Amen. If anybody's been
[49:47] blessed, Brother Matt has been blessed
[49:49] just to be here. Amen. And I just trust
[49:52] that you came with an empty cup this
[49:54] morning and you just say, "Lord, fill it
[49:56] back up." Amen. The Lord has just so uh
[49:59] stirred me this morning, even from the
[50:01] moment I woke up this morning and just
[50:04] is going to take me a direction that
[50:06] I'll be honest with you, I've never
[50:07] really preached before, preached some of
[50:10] these things before, but just the Lord
[50:12] just grabbed a hold of me. And so,
[50:14] normally that that'd make a preacher
[50:16] nervous, but I I just figure this church
[50:19] has got so much pull and push that I
[50:22] ain't got anything to be nervous about,
[50:23] brother
[50:24] Rod. Amen. So, you just pull out of God.
[50:27] You know, Brother Benham said that about
[50:29] that little woman with that blood issue.
[50:31] I think it's so powerful. He said, you
[50:33] know, that the father had shown Jesus
[50:35] everywhere to go, everything to do, who
[50:38] to heal, where to go. But did you know
[50:40] brother Brandham said that little woman
[50:41] with a blood issue the father didn't
[50:43] show him her? Amen. And he said that's
[50:47] why when she touched him he said who
[50:49] touched me?
[50:51] And the disciple says Lord you know
[50:53] almost Lord what do you mean everybody's
[50:55] touching you? Everybody's pulling on
[50:57] you. You see but there's something
[50:59] everybody can be coming to church.
[51:01] Everybody can come to worship and hear
[51:03] the preaching but there's some who touch
[51:04] him in a way that others can't touch
[51:07] him.
[51:08] And the and brother Brandham says,
[51:09] "Notice, she with her need in her life,
[51:13] she reached out and touched the hymn of
[51:15] the garment." And brother Brandham says
[51:16] it this way. She drew out from God what
[51:19] she needed from the Lord Jesus. And I
[51:22] believe if you've got a need this
[51:24] morning, you could pull out from the
[51:25] gift of God and say, "Lord, I've got a
[51:27] need. I'm going to pull it right out." I
[51:29] believe you you can come and meet me at
[51:31] my expectation this morning. Amen. The
[51:34] Lord can do it that way. God bless you.
[51:37] Uh if you have your Bible, turn to the
[51:38] book of Genesis, chapter 3 and then 1
[51:40] Corinthians chapter 2. I'm going to
[51:43] preach to you and I'm going to title
[51:44] this sermon
[51:45] today when it doesn't make sense.
[51:52] And to be honest, this sermon don't make
[51:54] a lot of sense. But the Lord, I believe,
[51:57] has something
[51:59] planned. Notice here in Genesis chapter
[52:02] 3, very familiar scripture. And and so
[52:05] we just want to look at it here today
[52:08] and then we'll turn to 1 Corinthians
[52:10] chapter
[52:15] 2. In verse 13 says, "And the Lord God
[52:18] said unto the woman, what is this that
[52:20] thou has done?" And the woman said, "The
[52:23] serpent begoured me, and I did eat." The
[52:25] Lord God said unto the serpent, "Because
[52:27] thou has done this, thou art cursed
[52:29] above all cattle above every beast of
[52:32] the field. Upon thy belly shalt thou go,
[52:34] and dust shall thou eat all the days of
[52:37] thy life. Now, I want you to notice this
[52:40] is the scripture we want to draw a
[52:42] context from because this is actually
[52:43] going to be a prophecy that he's going
[52:46] to give a prophecy forth that would
[52:48] circle the earth as brother Brandham
[52:49] said, prophecy does, waiting for
[52:51] fulfillment. And he says here, "And I
[52:53] will put enmity between thee and the
[52:55] woman, and between thy seed and her
[52:58] seed, and it shall bruise thy
[53:01] head, and thou shalt bruise his heel."
[53:05] Now, that didn't make any sense at all
[53:07] to the devil. But Jesus, what the L
[53:10] Jehovah spoke it and said, "Here's
[53:12] what's going to happen. It shall,"
[53:14] notice it again in verse 15, "it shall
[53:17] bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise
[53:20] his heel." 1 Corinthians chapter 2.
[53:22] Before you're seated, just turn there
[53:24] with me and we're just going to look at
[53:26] what uh here in verseh five we'll begin
[53:29] or verse six will begin 1 Corinthians
[53:32] chapter 2 6. How be it we speak wisdom
[53:37] among them that are perfect yet not the
[53:39] wisdom of this world. Notice nor of the
[53:43] princes of this world that come to not.
[53:47] But we speak the wisdom of God in a
[53:50] mystery, even the hidden wisdom which
[53:54] God ordained before the world
[53:59] unto our
[54:02] glory. You mean even before the world,
[54:05] our glory was already in the mind of
[54:08] God.
[54:10] The hidden wisdom, Paul says, notice it
[54:13] here. And he says here in verse eight,
[54:15] which none of the princes of this world
[54:18] knew, for had they known it, but he kept
[54:21] it from them. But here's what he says.
[54:23] But had they known it, they would not
[54:26] have crucified the Lord of glory. But as
[54:30] it is written, I hath not seen nor ear
[54:32] heard, neither hath it entered into the
[54:34] heart of man the things which God hath
[54:37] prepared for them that love him. But God
[54:41] hath revealed them unto us. Aren't you
[54:43] thankful by his spirit? For the spirit
[54:46] searchth all things, yay, the deep
[54:48] things of God, Lord Jesus, we just
[54:52] now, Lord, humble ourselves before you,
[54:56] Lord. And I just at this moment, God, am
[54:58] so aware of my own
[55:01] insufficiency, of my own inability,
[55:04] Lord. God, I'm a man who's full of
[55:06] mistakes and failures and fear and all
[55:09] kinds of things, Lord. Subject to
[55:11] anything that anybody in this building
[55:13] would be. Maybe that's why you called it
[55:14] the foolishness of preaching, Lord, that
[55:17] you would take a man who was just like
[55:19] anybody else, Lord. But if I could yield
[55:22] and surrender myself in such a way,
[55:24] Lord, and these people could look beyond
[55:26] that that veil of flesh, Lord, and they
[55:29] could hear from you, then Lord, there
[55:30] would be edification to the very heart
[55:33] and soul of people. I pray, God, that
[55:35] you would take the words of my mouth,
[55:37] Lord, as I just become subservient now
[55:39] to your spirit. I ask you, God, just
[55:42] simply to take complete control of this
[55:44] service. We pray. Grant it, Lord. We ask
[55:47] it in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. And you
[55:50] can be
[56:01] seated. You just bear with me as I try
[56:04] to find my place here and and and just
[56:08] begin to just pour my heart out as I'm
[56:10] ministering today on when it doesn't
[56:12] make sense. You know, you could we'll
[56:14] come back to this here in just a moment,
[56:16] but many times you read uh in the Bible
[56:20] of many men and their life, it didn't
[56:22] always make sense to everybody. In fact,
[56:25] most of the time, Brother Brandon said
[56:26] that real true men of God are some of
[56:29] the most misunderstood men in the whole
[56:31] world. Brother Brandon said that about
[56:32] his own ministry and said, "I will be
[56:34] one of the most under under
[56:36] misunderstood person. One of the most
[56:39] misunder misunderstood people sometimes
[56:41] is the family of God because many times
[56:44] God gives us a promise and it's never
[56:47] the struggle with us is never the
[56:49] promise that God gives us and believing
[56:51] what he said but the struggle comes
[56:54] sometimes when we look in the mirror and
[56:56] we see our own self and then we look at
[56:58] the promise and we think Lord this ain't
[57:00] matching up too well. I know what you
[57:03] said about me. I know what you've
[57:04] promised me Lord. I know what you said
[57:06] in your word and I want to say, Lord,
[57:09] I'm a believer with all of my heart. I
[57:11] believe every word of it, God. But
[57:13] sometimes I'm looking at my own
[57:15] incapability and my own insufficiency.
[57:18] And be honest with you, sometimes some
[57:20] of the struggles that that you have. And
[57:22] you know, one day you just feel like
[57:24] you're on top of the world and you you
[57:25] you're serving God and you're on fire.
[57:27] And man, sometimes if you'd be honest,
[57:30] you can get so low in your life and
[57:32] you're questioning if you were ever even
[57:35] called in the first
[57:36] place. And I believe for every believer,
[57:39] this is the struggle that we all live in
[57:42] in our own life. That we know beyond a
[57:44] shadow of a doubt that we have passed
[57:47] from death unto life. We know beyond a
[57:49] shadow of a doubt that God's word is
[57:51] true, that God is real, that God's a
[57:53] keeper of his word. But sometimes we
[57:56] face circumstances in our life and
[57:58] situations and it just doesn't make a
[58:01] lot of sense. Doesn't make a lot of
[58:04] sense. You think of I think of men like
[58:06] Joseph and here God gives him a dream
[58:08] and you know here was this dream and you
[58:10] could think my has this coat of many
[58:12] colors and and you can see the you know
[58:14] the wheat that was bowing to all of
[58:16] those things that God had given him. Now
[58:18] here was the promise here was the
[58:20] vision. Here's what God was bringing him
[58:22] to. But yet now he's thrown into a pit.
[58:25] He's forsaken by his own brothers. And
[58:28] you could think that God even if you
[58:30] look at Joseph's life from the moment
[58:32] that God makes the promise. Now if you
[58:34] look at the beginning, you've got the
[58:36] promise. If you look at the end, you got
[58:38] Joseph who's who's who's exalted on the
[58:41] throne. But it wasn't the struggle
[58:44] wasn't what going to be the middle or
[58:46] the beginning of the dream or the ending
[58:48] of the finality. But the struggle would
[58:50] come in what happens in the middle.
[58:55] And you see the greatest struggle of our
[58:57] life will never be believing the word of
[58:59] God. Friends, we won't struggle at all
[59:01] on that day of translation when our
[59:03] bodies are changed. But the struggle
[59:05] comes not with how much we believe the
[59:07] word of God. Not how much of we believe
[59:09] that we're a believer, but when we look
[59:11] at our own self and we look at our own
[59:14] mistakes and we I I wish somebody be
[59:16] honest with me here today. When we look
[59:18] at our own self and then we look at the
[59:20] word and we say, "Lord, I got to be
[59:21] honest. I don't I don't always line up.
[59:24] I don't always match up. It doesn't
[59:26] always make sense."
[59:29] But you see, this is the way that God
[59:32] ordained it from the very beginning of
[59:34] time. I want to take just a moment, and
[59:37] it may seem mixed up, and I'm just
[59:39] trusting the Lord to put it together,
[59:41] but it's amazing because this is
[59:43] actually the way that God intended it
[59:45] from the very beginning that God was
[59:48] going to take fallen, this was what was
[59:50] in his in his mind the entire time, that
[59:52] God was going to bring strength out of
[59:55] weakness. He was going to bring beauty
[59:57] out of ashes. He was going to bring
[1:00:00] splendor from the ruins.
[1:00:02] And God would need it to get to such a
[1:00:04] ruined state and destroyed state before
[1:00:07] he can bring restoration. Sometimes
[1:00:09] things got to get worse before it can
[1:00:11] ever get better. And sometimes it gets
[1:00:14] so dark and so so so so uh hopeless in
[1:00:17] your own life that you look and think, I
[1:00:19] think it's just impossible. I'll never
[1:00:21] make it. I I'll never get there.
[1:00:27] And you think of how many times you
[1:00:28] could think of this story, but this is
[1:00:30] the way that God ordained it that he
[1:00:32] would take our own humanity. And it was
[1:00:35] in his desire. It begins with he begins
[1:00:38] here and he says, I I want there to be a
[1:00:40] I want he tells Moses, I want you to
[1:00:42] make a house. I he says so that I may
[1:00:44] dwell among them. You see, this was the
[1:00:47] condition of Eden. Eden was a Eden was
[1:00:49] man's perfect environment. It was a
[1:00:52] place that was without trouble. Listen,
[1:00:54] Adam never had any depression. He didn't
[1:00:56] even know what it was about. In fact, he
[1:00:58] didn't even know what it was what what
[1:01:00] it meant to be fearful until he until he
[1:01:03] fell into sin. Then he says, "I was
[1:01:05] afraid, so I hid myself." But I want you
[1:01:09] to notice here that that condition of
[1:01:11] Eden actually was and I just want to say
[1:01:14] something this morning. I want you to
[1:01:16] think of Eden as not so much a place,
[1:01:18] though we know it was, but it was
[1:01:20] actually more than that. It was a
[1:01:21] condition that brother Brandham referred
[1:01:24] to in Christ as the mystery of God
[1:01:26] revealed of the three-fold purpose that
[1:01:28] God would eventually have a restored
[1:01:30] Eden.
[1:01:32] But it would it mean that we would go
[1:01:34] back to a literal place somewhere in
[1:01:35] Africa, Egypt, or wherever they say that
[1:01:37] it is? No, my brother, my sister. But it
[1:01:39] was actually God was going to create
[1:01:42] Eden which was I just want to say this
[1:01:44] for a moment was was an atmosphere.
[1:01:49] Eden was an environment. It's what God
[1:01:52] created man to live in. Oh, I I know you
[1:01:55] know this all too well, but every single
[1:01:57] time that God would create a creation,
[1:02:01] anything he would make, he would first
[1:02:03] make the environment for that creation
[1:02:06] to live in. Right? Before he made the
[1:02:09] fish, he first made the water because
[1:02:12] the water was not going the fish was not
[1:02:14] going to be for the water, but the water
[1:02:17] was going to be for the fish. And so
[1:02:20] every time before God ever made the
[1:02:22] creation, he would first make the
[1:02:24] environment that that creation was going
[1:02:26] to live in the water. Notice before he
[1:02:29] makes the plants, he makes first the
[1:02:32] soil for the plant to live in. Because
[1:02:34] before God planted the plant, it first
[1:02:37] had to have the condition or the
[1:02:39] atmosphere for that plant to live in. Is
[1:02:42] that simple enough for you? And so the
[1:02:44] plant, the earth was not the the plant
[1:02:46] was not made for the earth, but the
[1:02:49] earth was made for the plant.
[1:02:53] When he was creating stars, before he
[1:02:55] ever created the first star, he first
[1:02:57] made the firmament because the firmament
[1:03:00] was going to be what held the star. Can
[1:03:03] I say it this way? It would be the
[1:03:05] firmament that would allow the star to
[1:03:07] be a star.
[1:03:10] And so if he didn't have the firmament,
[1:03:12] he could never shine. The fish couldn't
[1:03:14] be the fish without the water. The plant
[1:03:16] could not be the plant. I hope you're
[1:03:18] catching it here today. God put so much
[1:03:21] emphasis on the atmosphere or the
[1:03:24] environment that he said without the
[1:03:26] atmosphere or the environment that
[1:03:29] creation can never live. Let me say it
[1:03:31] this way to you, my brother, my sister.
[1:03:33] Fish must have the water in order to
[1:03:36] live.
[1:03:38] Plants must have the soil in order to
[1:03:42] bloom or to blossom. Stars must have the
[1:03:46] firmament. And man must have Eden.
[1:03:50] Right.
[1:03:54] It was the atmosphere for man to be who
[1:03:57] God really created him to be in the
[1:04:02] original mind of God. Who man really was
[1:04:05] the perfect image of Jo. That's what
[1:04:08] Adam was, the perfect man image of God.
[1:04:12] But do you know what happens when you
[1:04:14] take the fish out of the water?
[1:04:19] He might breathe for a little while and
[1:04:21] his gills might move for a little while
[1:04:23] and he looks like he's flopping around
[1:04:24] in the boat like the crapp he was the
[1:04:26] other day. But if you keep him out of
[1:04:29] the water long enough, he'll eventually
[1:04:31] die. And what happens to the plants when
[1:04:34] you remove him from the earth? It might
[1:04:37] you might put it in a vase, sister, that
[1:04:39] brother got you. And you might put it on
[1:04:41] the window seal, but after a while,
[1:04:43] removed from the soil, eventually those
[1:04:46] pedals begin to fall and those arms
[1:04:48] begin to lower and that plant eventually
[1:04:51] dies. Why? It's nothing wrong with the
[1:04:53] abna. It's nothing wrong with God,
[1:04:55] nothing wrong with his program, but
[1:04:58] you've now removed that plant from his
[1:05:00] created intended position. And now he
[1:05:03] can't live anymore. What happens to the
[1:05:05] star when you remove him from the
[1:05:08] firmament, brother? He becomes a falling
[1:05:10] star or a comet, a meteor and he just
[1:05:14] literally destroys himself.
[1:05:19] And can I just say what happens to men?
[1:05:23] And women of God when you take them out
[1:05:26] of the presence of God, the atmosphere
[1:05:29] they were originally made to live in.
[1:05:32] Right? They might have they might have
[1:05:34] big muscles and they might have a big
[1:05:36] boisterous voice, but if they don't live
[1:05:38] in Eden in the presence of God, they
[1:05:41] become nothing more than a destroyer.
[1:05:43] They'll destroy a home. They'll destroy
[1:05:45] a marriage. They'll destroy a family.
[1:05:48] Because when you take that man out of
[1:05:51] how he was created to be in Eden, he
[1:05:53] becomes a falling star, a destroyer.
[1:05:59] When you remove him from the atmosphere
[1:06:01] that he was created to live in, which
[1:06:03] was the presence of God, he short
[1:06:05] circuits.
[1:06:07] He
[1:06:08] malfunctions because he was made to live
[1:06:12] in the environment of God because man
[1:06:15] was created to be the inhabitor or the
[1:06:19] house of God to live in. Right?
[1:06:24] And so notice this here because this was
[1:06:27] originally uh in the plan of God for man
[1:06:30] to be the temple of God. You know,
[1:06:32] brother Brandon says that actually that
[1:06:34] man was created to be he why did it have
[1:06:37] to be this Ephesian age? I know you know
[1:06:39] the quote so well. Why did it have to be
[1:06:41] so? Why was it that the seed of the
[1:06:42] serpent must come this way? Because man
[1:06:45] was created for God.
[1:06:49] Man, listen to this. Was to be the
[1:06:53] temple of God.
[1:06:57] The place of God's
[1:07:00] rest. He says, "What house will you
[1:07:03] build me and what will be the place of
[1:07:06] my
[1:07:08] rest?" And so, notice this is what the
[1:07:11] vision was. It was what God was working
[1:07:14] towards that man was to be the temple.
[1:07:18] It's what brother Adam says. I believe
[1:07:19] that God in the Garden of Eden before
[1:07:22] the Garden of Eden, I believe God knew
[1:07:24] the end from the beginning. Aren't you
[1:07:27] glad to know that? I believe he's not
[1:07:29] aimlessly making it up. He's not there
[1:07:31] just as he goes and, you know, ringing
[1:07:33] his hands out and oh, COVID happened.
[1:07:35] What am I going to do now? What's the
[1:07:36] next disease going to come? You know,
[1:07:38] just listen friends. God is not r God is
[1:07:41] not aimlessly trying to figure this
[1:07:43] thing out. He's not just waited and
[1:07:45] watched. I wonder I'll try this and see
[1:07:47] what happens. If that don't work, I'll
[1:07:48] I'll go to plan B. And if there's no
[1:07:50] plan B, listen, I want you to go ahead
[1:07:52] and put it in your mind. There ain't no
[1:07:53] plan B. There ain't no plan C. There
[1:07:56] ain't no plan D. There's a plan A. And
[1:07:59] you're part of that plan. And God will
[1:08:02] perform that plan in your life the very
[1:08:06] same way. He's seen it before you ever
[1:08:08] breathe your first breath. It doesn't
[1:08:11] matter what happens in the middle. God
[1:08:13] will get you from the beginning because
[1:08:15] my Bible says he is not just the author,
[1:08:18] he is the finisher.
[1:08:21] And he will finish what he starts.
[1:08:27] I'm so glad to know that there's been so
[1:08:30] many times in my life when it didn't
[1:08:32] make a lot of sense. When when God's
[1:08:35] plan for my own life wasn't adding up to
[1:08:37] me. I'll be honest with
[1:08:39] you. God's servants don't always have it
[1:08:42] all figured out.
[1:08:45] Go ahead and let the cat out of the bag
[1:08:47] and we don't always understand it. God's
[1:08:51] prophets don't even understand
[1:08:53] everything all the
[1:08:56] time. Many times you go through things
[1:08:58] and battles in your life and it just
[1:09:01] doesn't make sense.
[1:09:06] I was telling brother Andrew and the
[1:09:08] Lord just inspired me to to to to give
[1:09:10] this
[1:09:11] here in 2013 in August. Never forget the
[1:09:15] day I woke up in the middle of the night
[1:09:17] to use the restroom sometime in the
[1:09:20] morning. Wee hours of the morning, not
[1:09:21] sure what time it was. Got up out of bed
[1:09:23] and the only way I can say it is the
[1:09:25] next thing I know I thought I was out of
[1:09:27] bed, but I was on the ground. I could
[1:09:29] feel the carpet and I was trying to come
[1:09:31] to myself and not realizing what what
[1:09:33] what's happened? Why am I on the ground?
[1:09:35] And I I remember I'll never forget I
[1:09:37] turned over and I just looked up in the
[1:09:39] room and and I seen the whole room was
[1:09:41] just spinning just like a like a
[1:09:43] merrygoround. Everything was going round
[1:09:45] and around and I thought I thought for a
[1:09:46] moment started crying out to the Lord. I
[1:09:48] thought I was having a heart attack.
[1:09:50] Thought I was dying. I couldn't speak
[1:09:52] and it just paralyzed me and and I it
[1:09:54] became so strong I I blacked out. Just
[1:09:56] blacked out from it. Not really know
[1:09:58] what was going on. And I remember I woke
[1:10:00] up and I was just in a sweat all over my
[1:10:02] body and I and I just crawled around and
[1:10:05] I kept looking and the room was still
[1:10:07] spinning. I crawled off to the couch and
[1:10:09] I uh I laid there and I just passed out
[1:10:12] just blacked
[1:10:13] out and and and I woke up the next
[1:10:16] morning and and and it was and I
[1:10:18] remember opening my eyes and and my wife
[1:10:20] coming to the couch there and and she's
[1:10:22] asking, "Why are you on the couch?" And
[1:10:24] I just I just had and I opened my eyes
[1:10:26] and everything was moving. I could hear
[1:10:28] in my right ear just a rush just like
[1:10:30] you put your ear in a in a in a sea
[1:10:32] shell and you could just hear the roar
[1:10:33] of the ocean. That's all it was was just
[1:10:35] a roar. And I thought my and I told her
[1:10:38] I said I don't know what's happening. I
[1:10:39] got you know some kind of ear infection
[1:10:41] or something in my in my ear. I I can't
[1:10:43] I'm dizzy. I can't hardly walk. And I
[1:10:46] could I mean couldn't even hardly get my
[1:10:48] balance and tried to stand up and I fell
[1:10:50] right back down. And so we just begin to
[1:10:52] call the doctor there at our church,
[1:10:53] brother, and he's talking to me. I know
[1:10:55] you probably got, you know, all kinds
[1:10:57] of, you know, he named all kinds of
[1:10:58] things it could be. And man, I first
[1:11:00] thing I did was I'd heard all about
[1:11:02] those ear candles. And man, I went and
[1:11:04] got me one. And buddy, let me tell you,
[1:11:06] things came out of my ear I never would
[1:11:08] have
[1:11:11] imagined. How could that possibly fit in
[1:11:14] that
[1:11:15] ear? Don't mean to gross you out, just
[1:11:17] telling you the truth.
[1:11:20] And I and I was trying everything to get
[1:11:22] that ear, you know, to just to to fix. I
[1:11:24] couldn't figure it out. And the brother
[1:11:25] came over, looked at me, he says, "Yeah,
[1:11:27] your boy, your ear is clean." I said,
[1:11:28] "Yeah, I
[1:11:32] know." He said, "Man, that's whistly
[1:11:35] clean." And and so he says, "Well,
[1:11:37] brother Matt, it's probably nothing. You
[1:11:39] know, you just uh" he said, "It's
[1:11:40] probably ear infection and some kind."
[1:11:42] And so, but as the day went on, it was
[1:11:45] got worse. And it was that weekend that
[1:11:47] we was having their special meetings
[1:11:48] with brother Donnie Reagan there at our
[1:11:50] church. And it was a meeting was
[1:11:52] supposed to start that night. And I
[1:11:54] remember I the next day had woken up.
[1:11:56] And man, it just seemed like it went
[1:11:58] from bad to worse. And and I just I just
[1:12:00] there in that moment couldn't hardly get
[1:12:02] up. And and I and I tried standing up
[1:12:04] and I couldn't. Tried to walk couldn't.
[1:12:07] But I wanted to go to church so bad. I
[1:12:09] thought I'm not going to miss out on
[1:12:11] these meetings. So my my dad, my
[1:12:13] brothers, I think it was, came over and
[1:12:15] picked me up and I had had to be helped
[1:12:18] and put me in the car and and took me to
[1:12:20] church and laid me down in the back
[1:12:22] sound booth where nobody could see me. I
[1:12:24] just wanted to be in church so bad.
[1:12:26] Remember going up to that the end of
[1:12:28] that service and they took me up there
[1:12:30] and and laid hands on me. Brother Donnie
[1:12:32] prayed for me and and the brothers there
[1:12:34] and and and I just remember, you know,
[1:12:36] that Monday going to the doctor and and
[1:12:38] it just it seemed like, man, it went
[1:12:40] from bad to worse. And and that Monday
[1:12:42] morning, I went to the ENT to find out
[1:12:44] what's what's really going on. And so he
[1:12:46] brings me into the aiologist said,
[1:12:48] "First thing we're going to do is a
[1:12:49] hearing test on you." And and he and he
[1:12:51] takes me into that room. If you ever had
[1:12:53] a hearing test before and you got that
[1:12:55] little clicker, how many's ever had one
[1:12:56] of those? And uh Okay, good. We got some
[1:12:59] got some people know what I'm talking
[1:13:01] about. And uh and so he so he you know
[1:13:04] they bring you in in the left ear and
[1:13:06] I'm clicking clicking click and click
[1:13:07] and you hear
[1:13:09] the click click click and he says we're
[1:13:13] going to test your right ear now and
[1:13:14] came into my right ear. Nothing nothing
[1:13:19] or nothing. I thought he didn't start
[1:13:21] it. He opened the door and he he just
[1:13:22] had a real somber look. He said you
[1:13:24] didn't you didn't hear none of that. I
[1:13:25] said no sir. He said all right I'm going
[1:13:27] to go loud loud as I can. Let's do it
[1:13:29] again. Did it again. nothing. And uh he
[1:13:33] came back and he said, "All right, Mr.
[1:13:34] Watkins, let's come with me. Follow me.
[1:13:36] We'll go to the office." Took me back
[1:13:37] there and I'll never forget when that
[1:13:39] Dr. Christian walked in and he said he
[1:13:41] said, "Mr. Watkins, I got good news and
[1:13:43] I got bad news. Which one you want
[1:13:45] first?" I said, "Give me the bad." And
[1:13:47] he said, "Well," he said, "you have what
[1:13:49] affects 6,000 US citizens every single
[1:13:52] year. It's an idiopathic disease.
[1:13:55] Idiopathic. Think of the word ignorant
[1:13:57] because that's what it means. That
[1:13:58] they're ignorant of why it happens.
[1:14:00] don't know, don't have a clue. They
[1:14:02] theorize what it might be. And he said,
[1:14:04] "It's an idiopathic disease called
[1:14:06] sudden sensurial hearing loss, sudden
[1:14:09] deafness." And he said, and he said,
[1:14:11] "The bad news is," he says that some
[1:14:13] people can re can we can actually give
[1:14:15] them steroids and you could you could
[1:14:16] get your hearing back. And and he said,
[1:14:18] "But you're you're I want to tell you."
[1:14:20] He said, "You're" He said, "The the the
[1:14:22] problem is," he says, "we don't know
[1:14:24] why, but whenever there's more than 40
[1:14:27] dB of loss," and he said, "Whenever
[1:14:29] there's more than 40 dB and vertigo
[1:14:32] associated with it," he said, "there
[1:14:34] ain't there ain't nobody that's ever got
[1:14:36] their hearing back. None at all." He
[1:14:37] said, "There's no," in his words, he
[1:14:39] said, "there was no statistic for a
[1:14:41] recovery." He said, "I hate to tell you,
[1:14:43] he said, your hearing is more than 80 dB
[1:14:45] loss. You have no hearing. you're
[1:14:47] bilaterally deaf and you will be the
[1:14:49] rest of your life. And he said, and he
[1:14:52] said, "And that's a terrible news." And
[1:14:54] he said, "You you'll struggle socially
[1:14:56] to be in places where people are talking
[1:14:58] in loud environments." And and he said,
[1:15:00] "You know, life will be in it'll be a
[1:15:02] big adjustment for you." He said, "You
[1:15:04] you can do rehabilitation to to for your
[1:15:07] walking and your vertigo." And I had
[1:15:08] what they call benign positional
[1:15:10] vertigo. And and he said, "That will
[1:15:11] that'll go away." And he says, 'But
[1:15:13] probably the tenitus you'll have for,
[1:15:15] you know, and and he said, 'Th that's
[1:15:17] all you'll have. You won't have no
[1:15:18] hearing. He said, 'I just want to be
[1:15:19] straight with you and tell you.' And he
[1:15:21] said, 'But people can live a mostly
[1:15:23] normal life, that's the good news, you
[1:15:25] know, with bilateral hearing. He said,
[1:15:27] if you ever feel sorry for yourself,
[1:15:29] just come to my office. I'll show you
[1:15:30] people that ain't got no hearing at all.
[1:15:34] Amazing to feel sorry for yourself till
[1:15:35] you see somebody worse.
[1:15:38] And and he said, "And I hate to tell you
[1:15:40] that." He said, "But I ain't got no no
[1:15:42] better news, nothing I can do to help
[1:15:44] you." He said, "You know, we'd give you
[1:15:45] a hearing aid, but there ain't nothing
[1:15:47] to amplify." He said, "I'm sorry to tell
[1:15:48] you that." He said, "You'll never get
[1:15:50] any hearing back." He said, "For 30
[1:15:51] days, we'll discharge you. We can put
[1:15:53] you on a course of steroids if you want,
[1:15:55] but really," he said, "there's nothing
[1:15:56] we can do. You know, we'll be be back in
[1:15:58] checkup for," and I think it was in
[1:16:00] three weeks. Boy, I tell you what, life
[1:16:04] can change like that.
[1:16:09] And you won't believe the attack of the
[1:16:11] devil, the enemy in my mind. I'll never
[1:16:13] forget the nights that I I I'd laid
[1:16:15] there on the couch with the vertigo so
[1:16:17] bad, couldn't walk and couldn't hear
[1:16:19] anything. And I'd go into rooms and and
[1:16:21] he said, "One of the things you'll lose
[1:16:22] is sound localization. It takes two ears
[1:16:25] to be able to locate sound." and my
[1:16:27] phone could ring right beside me, but if
[1:16:29] I my eyes didn't see it, I could have
[1:16:31] been in two rooms. I didn't know where
[1:16:32] it was. I have to come into the house
[1:16:34] and Rachel, she'd have to tell me what
[1:16:36] room she's in when she'd talk because I
[1:16:38] couldn't tell. I just heard a voice. And
[1:16:40] and I tell you what, friends, sometimes
[1:16:42] it don't make
[1:16:45] sense. Sometimes it don't make sense at
[1:16:48] all. You think, why? Well, Lord, what
[1:16:50] did I do? Why did this happen? What's
[1:16:53] taking place in my life? And what? And
[1:16:55] you start to go back over all your steps
[1:16:57] and you turn over every stone and Lord,
[1:16:59] where why where did I miss you? What did
[1:17:00] I do? Why is this happening? Why? You
[1:17:02] know why? Why, Lord? Why? Why? You know
[1:17:04] what's so sad is that so many people,
[1:17:08] they ask the question why? And there's
[1:17:10] nothing wrong with asking the question
[1:17:12] why. But a lot of people, let me say it
[1:17:15] this way, they die in the why.
[1:17:20] And they never go beyond the why. And I
[1:17:23] let me say this friends, I have watched
[1:17:24] people go through the very same thing,
[1:17:27] the very same uh problem, the very same
[1:17:29] sickness, the very same disease. And I
[1:17:31] have watched people who have went
[1:17:33] through the same exact battles. And I've
[1:17:35] watched one that has gotten better. And
[1:17:37] I've watched one who's gotten bitter. It
[1:17:40] is not what happens. You cannot control
[1:17:42] what comes to your life. You can You
[1:17:44] don't ask for it. You don't sign up for
[1:17:46] it. There's only one thing you have the
[1:17:48] decision to make is what will you do
[1:17:51] with the trials and troubles and
[1:17:53] struggles that come in your life. You
[1:17:56] will either go up or you will go down.
[1:18:02] And I had a choice to make. What am I
[1:18:04] going to do with this in my life? I
[1:18:06] remember laying there on the couch and
[1:18:08] and and it was just such a struggle and
[1:18:10] couldn't hear. tried to go and went with
[1:18:12] my family somewhere to eat and and just
[1:18:14] got so discouraged with my with my
[1:18:16] brothers, my mom and dad. I just to take
[1:18:18] me home. I couldn't hear anything
[1:18:20] anybody was saying and if we was any
[1:18:22] kind of room where people would talk, I
[1:18:23] couldn't hear nothing and try to people
[1:18:25] would speak to me and I didn't know who
[1:18:27] it was talking to me. I'd have to look
[1:18:29] eye I I I and make see who's looking at
[1:18:31] me to know who was speaking to me. It's
[1:18:32] just horrible. And I tell you what, it
[1:18:35] was it was such a I I I never forget
[1:18:37] that moment of laying there and I and
[1:18:40] but yet something inside of me I I just
[1:18:42] I just I just be begin just very very
[1:18:44] very very small. Wasn't very large. On
[1:18:47] the outside it was a lot of fear, a lot
[1:18:49] of doubt, a lot of worry, a lot of
[1:18:52] struggle. But way down deep on the
[1:18:54] inside there was just a belief.
[1:18:57] Oh yeah. And sometimes all you got is
[1:18:59] just something so
[1:19:02] small. And we had meetings later and
[1:19:05] Brother Tim, Brother Timothy actually
[1:19:07] came through and preached for us and and
[1:19:08] and laid hands on me and prayed for me.
[1:19:10] And I'll never forget about one week
[1:19:13] later actually it was two days later
[1:19:15] after that service. I just began to conf
[1:19:18] I was laying on my couch. It was on a
[1:19:20] Tuesday. It was on a Wednesday night. I
[1:19:22] couldn't go to church and I I was laying
[1:19:25] there and a brother had had called had
[1:19:27] had called me and and I'd helped them
[1:19:29] their church used to do this years and
[1:19:31] years ago help churches with some
[1:19:32] streaming they were trying to do and so
[1:19:34] I'd helped them set up some things for
[1:19:36] their little church to have some stream
[1:19:38] and that brother had texted me not
[1:19:40] knowing what I went through and he said,
[1:19:41] "Brother Maddie said, I'm not sure.
[1:19:42] You're probably in church. We're having
[1:19:43] an issue. Is there any way you'd get on
[1:19:45] our our stream and and try to figure out
[1:19:47] what's going on?" I was not at church. I
[1:19:49] was at home and so so I'm trying to pull
[1:19:51] it up and I'm laying there and I friends
[1:19:53] I'll just be honest with you. I was so
[1:19:55] low. I was so down. I I I just was I
[1:19:58] just couldn't hardly be encouraged at
[1:20:00] all. And and I just turned on that that
[1:20:04] service. And right when I turned it on,
[1:20:06] the pastor was already at the pull pit
[1:20:07] and he and his first words he says he
[1:20:10] says, "Now you all know the brother."
[1:20:12] And he named the brother in his church.
[1:20:13] And he said, "You know that brother
[1:20:15] really well." And he said, you know,
[1:20:16] he's not apt to be a, you know, uh,
[1:20:18] fanatical about things. And he said he
[1:20:20] he had given me a piece of paper and he
[1:20:23] said about a month ago and he said it
[1:20:25] was written something that the Lord had
[1:20:27] given him and just supernaturally and
[1:20:30] and he and he said and he and he just
[1:20:31] gave it to me and said, "Brother, I just
[1:20:33] Lord gave me this inspired told me to
[1:20:35] give it to you." And he said, "So I read
[1:20:37] it about a month ago and he said, "I
[1:20:38] didn't know what it meant and Lord, I
[1:20:40] don't know what it who's it for. Is it
[1:20:42] for me?" sort of thinking it was maybe
[1:20:43] for me somewhere it makes sense in my
[1:20:45] life. And he says, "But this evening
[1:20:47] that brother came to my office and said,
[1:20:49] "Brother," he said, "that's not for you.
[1:20:51] The Lord told me you've got to read that
[1:20:53] note and you got to read it tonight in
[1:20:56] this
[1:20:57] service." And he said, "So whoever you
[1:20:59] are, listen up because it's for you,
[1:21:01] buddy." My one ear was listening really
[1:21:03] good.
[1:21:07] And I never forget the words he said to
[1:21:09] so take this from the Lord. And he said,
[1:21:10] "Just take it from God." He began to
[1:21:12] read something that means so much to me.
[1:21:15] I don't have it here. I could quote the
[1:21:16] whole thing, but he began to say and it
[1:21:18] and it said, "When you don't understand
[1:21:21] the Lord's," and he said, "When you
[1:21:22] don't understand the Lord's path for
[1:21:24] your life and it doesn't make sense to
[1:21:26] you and when it doesn't add up to you
[1:21:29] and you want to give up and you want to
[1:21:31] give in and you want to run away, just
[1:21:33] wait. Be patient. Don't doubt. Don't
[1:21:36] fret. God is moving. Only wait."
[1:21:42] That's right. And that may sound like
[1:21:44] nothing to you, but buddy, let me tell
[1:21:46] you something. That stirred my heart
[1:21:49] from the deepest part in the part of my
[1:21:51] soul. I said, "Lord, I believe that was
[1:21:53] from you. I'm going to take it. I My
[1:21:55] wife got home and I was balling." And
[1:21:57] she said, "What's wrong and what
[1:21:59] happened?" I said, "No, no, the I said,
[1:22:00] "I'm happy." I said, and I told her,
[1:22:02] "Oh, what happened?" And she said, "I I
[1:22:04] don't even have words to describe this."
[1:22:06] She said, "Do you know that that's the
[1:22:08] very same almost identical verbatim?"
[1:22:11] She said, "I put that on the
[1:22:12] refrigerator about a week ago, and the
[1:22:14] Lord told me it was going to be for
[1:22:16] somebody." And she began to read it. And
[1:22:18] it was like reading back. That man
[1:22:19] didn't read that. But God had so lined
[1:22:22] up the two thoughts and the inspiration
[1:22:24] to say, "God is moving. God is moving.
[1:22:26] Don't move. Just be still. Only wait."
[1:22:33] And it doesn't always make sense, but
[1:22:35] sometimes that's what God's wanting us
[1:22:37] to do is just wait.
[1:22:40] Don't get in a hurry. God's not in a
[1:22:42] hurry.
[1:22:44] And I laid there on that couch and I I
[1:22:46] woke up the next day and something had
[1:22:49] changed. Wasn't sure what it was, but I
[1:22:51] thought something's a little different.
[1:22:54] I knew something had came back. Now,
[1:22:55] they had already told me, "You'd never
[1:22:57] hear again. you're going to be
[1:22:58] bilaterally deaf the rest of your life.
[1:23:00] My follow-up visit was about 3 days
[1:23:02] later and every single day I knew it was
[1:23:04] getting better. And I begin to testify
[1:23:06] to our church. I testified to my family.
[1:23:08] I said, "I don't know what God's doing.
[1:23:10] I don't know. I Here's what I know. He's
[1:23:12] doing something. I may not be able to
[1:23:14] understand it all, but I do know this.
[1:23:16] He's busy whether I see him. He's
[1:23:18] working whether I feel him. He's moving.
[1:23:21] Whether I hear from him.
[1:23:25] Hallelujah.
[1:23:28] And I went back to that doctor, same
[1:23:30] exact doctor, Dr. Christian. I walked in
[1:23:32] there and I'll never forget that that
[1:23:33] lady the look on that lady's face. She
[1:23:35] says, "Now, Mr. Watkins, I'm sorry. We
[1:23:37] have to do another test on." I said,
[1:23:38] "No, no, no, no. I want to do the test."
[1:23:41] She said, "Okay. Oh, well, you come
[1:23:43] right in." And she took me into that
[1:23:44] aiologist and he said, "No, it's
[1:23:46] procedure we got." I said, "No, no, no.
[1:23:47] I I want to do it." He said, "Okay,
[1:23:49] okay. Go on in." And he had my test
[1:23:52] results from before left ear is
[1:23:53] clicking, clicking, clicking. And I'll
[1:23:55] never forget sitting there waiting. I
[1:23:57] said, "Lord, now I believe with all of
[1:24:00] my heart that you are the same
[1:24:02] yesterday, today, and forever." And when
[1:24:05] doctors say it's impossible, Lord, I
[1:24:07] believe that all things as you told
[1:24:08] Abraham is anything too hard for the
[1:24:11] Lord. And he said, "Mr. Watkins, we're
[1:24:14] going to test your right ear now." I
[1:24:15] said, "Okay, go ahead." And it wasn't
[1:24:17] like the left ear, but I heard it. Beep
[1:24:20] click beep click beep click beep
[1:24:25] click. That guy opened that door. He
[1:24:28] said you heard that. I said yes sir. He
[1:24:31] said that was dead accurate. He said I'm
[1:24:32] I'm going to do that again. Can we I
[1:24:34] want to test your He says I want to tell
[1:24:35] you. They do a test. It's called your
[1:24:38] discrim. And he said I want to give you
[1:24:40] 20 words. He said he said Mr. Watkins if
[1:24:42] you can hear any of them. And he said,
[1:24:44] "Even if you don't get the word right,
[1:24:46] say whatever you hear." I got out of 20
[1:24:48] words, 18 of 20 I got right.
[1:24:51] [Applause]
[1:24:58] Glory.
[1:25:01] Hallelujah. I walked back and he he came
[1:25:03] into the room. He busted in. He said,
[1:25:05] "You got to come with me. Dr. Christian
[1:25:07] ain't going to know." He said, "I just
[1:25:08] want to tell you right now." He said,
[1:25:09] "He ain't going to know what to say." I
[1:25:11] said, "All right." I came back to that
[1:25:12] room. I'll never forget when he opened
[1:25:14] that door, he had his clipboard, he
[1:25:15] threw it on the table. He said, "Buddy,"
[1:25:17] he said, "Mr. Watkins," he said, "I just
[1:25:19] want to tell you, you prove me wrong.
[1:25:21] You prove the whole world wrong." He
[1:25:22] said, "I don't have a word to to make
[1:25:24] sense out of
[1:25:26] this." And he says, "But I I
[1:25:32] Hallelujah." He said, "I can't describe
[1:25:34] what's happened. and all I can tell you
[1:25:36] is that you've got 40 dB back in your
[1:25:39] right ear than you had when you came
[1:25:41] here 3 weeks ago. And he said, you know,
[1:25:43] he said, I don't want to give you false
[1:25:45] hope. You know, your your right ear
[1:25:46] ain't like your left ear. I said, I want
[1:25:48] to say you didn't give me any hope.
[1:25:51] He said, I could put a hearing aid in
[1:25:52] you right now. You'd hear like anybody
[1:25:54] else. Let me tell you something, my
[1:25:55] brother and my sister. I believe that
[1:25:57] God is the same yesterday, today, and
[1:25:59] forever. What he starts, he will finish.
[1:26:04] [Applause]
[1:26:08] Hallelujah. I went maybe a month later.
[1:26:11] It was about six months later in
[1:26:12] Phoenix. I was doing free aiologist test
[1:26:14] there for a in a Cabela. I was in
[1:26:16] Cabelas looking for some stuff and they
[1:26:18] had a hearing and the lady looked at me
[1:26:20] said you're too young to have hearing
[1:26:21] loss. I said no. I I told her what I
[1:26:23] had. So she said, "Why do you want to
[1:26:24] retest?" I said, "Well, I believe my
[1:26:26] hearings got better." And she looked at
[1:26:27] me so crooked. She said, "A hear a
[1:26:30] sudden sension of hearing loss? You
[1:26:32] don't get hearing back?" I said, "Well,
[1:26:33] I just want to tell you I believe it's
[1:26:35] gotten us six months later." I said, "I
[1:26:36] believe it's I got 40 dB dB back." She
[1:26:39] said, "You did?" I said, "Yeah, I could
[1:26:41] tell she didn't believe me." So, he
[1:26:43] said, "All right, come in the booth."
[1:26:44] So, she starts testing me and she's
[1:26:46] testing and she came on there. She
[1:26:48] opened that door. She said, "Mr.
[1:26:49] Watkins, show me your last hearing.
[1:26:51] Where was your last hearing result at?"
[1:26:53] I told her where the the right ear, the
[1:26:54] low frequenc. She says, "There's about
[1:26:56] 25 more decimals than you're saying you
[1:26:58] had the last time.
[1:27:02] What's impossible with man
[1:27:05] is possible
[1:27:07] with God.
[1:27:13] Glory. But I tell you what, in the midst
[1:27:16] of that, in the middle of that, now I my
[1:27:18] hearing ain't perfect on my right ear,
[1:27:20] but I want to tell you, I believe that
[1:27:22] God's not a starter. He's a finisher of
[1:27:24] what he started. I believe God is going
[1:27:26] to give me back 100% of my hearing in my
[1:27:29] right ear. You believe that with me?
[1:27:34] Glory.
[1:27:37] But I tell you that it didn't make sense
[1:27:39] in the middle of that trial, going
[1:27:41] through that struggle. It didn't make
[1:27:43] sense to me. Lord, why is this
[1:27:45] happening? What's what's taking place in
[1:27:47] my life? I don't understand. You begin
[1:27:50] to question everything, Lord. What did I
[1:27:51] do? Why did Why did this happen? Lord,
[1:27:54] you know, that's the first thing we
[1:27:55] always do with suffering. We don't
[1:27:58] understand. Why does it happen? Why am I
[1:28:00] going through this, Lord? Why must I
[1:28:02] suffer? And we so quickly forget what
[1:28:06] brother Brandham taught us in the Samian
[1:28:08] church age. And I'll give you the words
[1:28:09] of a prophet. He said, "The church that
[1:28:11] isn't struggling. The church that
[1:28:13] doesn't have problems. The church that
[1:28:16] doesn't have trouble hasn't got it. It
[1:28:18] isn't even of God." So my brother, my
[1:28:21] sister, let me tell you, don't you
[1:28:23] question when you have struggles and you
[1:28:25] have trials and you have suffering. It
[1:28:28] is the proof that God is with you. It is
[1:28:30] the proof that God has put his sign of
[1:28:33] approval upon your
[1:28:36] life. Sometimes the very things you
[1:28:39] think disqualify you are the very things
[1:28:42] that qualify you to be a son or daughter
[1:28:45] of God. Your failure in your life is not
[1:28:48] final. I said your mistake in your life
[1:28:51] is not the end of the story. But God has
[1:28:54] put something in you.
[1:28:59] Hallelujah.
[1:29:01] [Applause]
[1:29:03] And we struggle with this question. Why
[1:29:05] must I suffer this way? Brother Brandham
[1:29:08] says he's left a measure of suffering
[1:29:09] for every age. No age is exempt. Because
[1:29:13] character is not a a a gift, but
[1:29:17] character is a victory. And there can't
[1:29:20] be a victory without a battle.
[1:29:26] And so God ordained it this way. It was
[1:29:28] the very way. Even, you know, you even
[1:29:30] look at, you know, Job in the Bible.
[1:29:33] Look at the Apostle Paul. Can I just
[1:29:34] take a moment here? Just the Lord just
[1:29:36] led me this way. And so, Lord, I'm going
[1:29:38] to I'm going to go that way. Is that all
[1:29:40] right? Can I just say, and I hope you
[1:29:42] don't misunderstand me. Can I say to you
[1:29:45] today that I believe that there's a Holy
[1:29:47] Ghost school
[1:29:51] school? Yeah. I believe there's a Holy
[1:29:55] Ghost school with a curriculum, with a
[1:29:58] principal of dean, you want to call it
[1:30:00] that. I believe there's a Holy Ghost
[1:30:03] school and it consists of
[1:30:07] saints down through the
[1:30:09] ages who have suffered greatly in their
[1:30:13] life,
[1:30:15] tossed to and fro, tempted, tested,
[1:30:18] tried, mistreated. The Bible speaks of
[1:30:21] this in the book of Philippians. It says
[1:30:23] that Paul says that I may know him in
[1:30:26] the power of his resurrection. Oh, and a
[1:30:30] thousand hands went up and said that I
[1:30:32] may know him in the power. But can you
[1:30:34] keep going? And in the fellowship
[1:30:40] of his sufferings.
[1:30:42] I like that, brother Ron. You know, a
[1:30:44] fellowship sort of sounds like a school,
[1:30:45] like a club you're part of. Man, I'm in
[1:30:47] a fellowship of what? of suffering.
[1:30:54] That's what Paul said. The fellowship of
[1:30:57] his sufferings to be made conformable
[1:31:00] unto his death. It's a fellowship of
[1:31:03] suffering, deep, mysterious,
[1:31:05] unfathomable, sometimes
[1:31:08] trials, sometimes testing. And let me
[1:31:11] say that to you today that this is a
[1:31:13] school that Jesus himself set up. and he
[1:31:18] made the curriculum.
[1:31:22] And let me say to you that Jesus proved
[1:31:25] it is possible to go through the very
[1:31:28] gates of hell in your life and come out
[1:31:32] on the other side more than a conqueror
[1:31:35] in Christ Jesus.
[1:31:38] He proved that you too can graduate as
[1:31:41] an overcomer of this world.
[1:31:46] Jesus suffered, let me say it to you
[1:31:48] this way. Jesus suffered, you think, oh,
[1:31:50] he suffered on a cross. Yes, he did. But
[1:31:53] let me go further than that. He suffered
[1:31:54] mental anguish. He suffered physical
[1:31:57] pain. He was rejected. He was to He knew
[1:31:59] what rejection felt like. I tell you
[1:32:01] what, that's a powerful That's a
[1:32:03] powerful emotion that Satan can afflict
[1:32:05] you and wound you in your life is
[1:32:07] rejection.
[1:32:10] And you may say, "I don't deal with
[1:32:12] that. I I don't even know what that."
[1:32:13] Well, you might not, but let me tell you
[1:32:15] something. That's what they deal with,
[1:32:17] and they can't fight your battles, and
[1:32:19] you can't fight their battle. So, don't
[1:32:21] try to compare your trial with somebody
[1:32:23] else. So, I can't relate to that person
[1:32:25] who struggles with that or struggles
[1:32:27] with this cuz I don't struggle. But let
[1:32:28] me tell you something, brother. You
[1:32:30] can't be me and I can't be you. And I've
[1:32:33] got to be who God ordained me with
[1:32:35] because let me say it this way. You will
[1:32:37] never slay your Goliath using another
[1:32:40] man's slingshot. God gave you a
[1:32:42] slingshot to slay the enemy that he put
[1:32:44] in your life. And your test and your
[1:32:47] trial may be totally different than
[1:32:49] mine.
[1:32:51] But I say in the words of a prophet, be
[1:32:53] who you are. Be who God made you and
[1:32:56] we'll all score the touchdown and we'll
[1:32:59] go home after a while.
[1:33:03] I can't live your life and you can't
[1:33:05] live mine.
[1:33:06] And I've realized a long time ago there
[1:33:08] will be people who go through things
[1:33:09] that I cannot relate with. But I'll go
[1:33:11] through things they have no way of
[1:33:13] relating to. But I want to tell you who
[1:33:15] can. Brother Brandham said, "And how do
[1:33:17] I overcome?" Jesus suffered every
[1:33:19] temptation man could suffer.
[1:33:23] Everything you could ever go through, he
[1:33:25] suffered it in his human body. Think of
[1:33:28] anything. Put anything in that bucket of
[1:33:30] suffering. You can call it any
[1:33:32] temptation. I don't care what it is. I
[1:33:34] don't care how low. I don't care how
[1:33:35] grievous you think. My goodness, could a
[1:33:37] a person good, you go that low and you,
[1:33:40] brother Matt, you know what they did?
[1:33:41] You know what they you know what they
[1:33:43] struggled with? I mean, goodness
[1:33:44] gracious, how could they be a, you know,
[1:33:46] a son of God or daughter of God? Let me
[1:33:47] give you the words of the Apostle Paul.
[1:33:49] Of such were some of you,
[1:33:53] but you hath he cleansed, but you hath
[1:33:56] he washed. I think if we've received
[1:33:59] grace, how much more should we give
[1:34:01] grace to others? that brother, I may not
[1:34:04] understand it, but I want to tell you
[1:34:06] the same God who brought me through my
[1:34:08] trial and me through my test will bring
[1:34:10] you on the other side of that trial
[1:34:12] victorious.
[1:34:17] He suffered mental anguish. He was
[1:34:19] distrusted. He was abused. He was
[1:34:21] laughed at. He was mocked. He knew what
[1:34:23] it felt to be lonely. He knew what it
[1:34:25] felt to be hungry. Do you know Jesus
[1:34:28] felt the pain that we some of you will
[1:34:29] never feel hunger but he was
[1:34:33] hungry? He was lonely. He was unloved.
[1:34:38] He was shamed. He was he was made fun
[1:34:40] of. He was called a liar. He was called
[1:34:42] a fraud. He knew what it meant to be
[1:34:44] talked about and be ridiculed. And God
[1:34:47] allowed him to not open his mouth to
[1:34:49] defend himself.
[1:34:52] Can I preach to you here just for a
[1:34:53] moment? He knew what it was like for his
[1:34:56] most to trusted
[1:34:58] friends. Even his own family
[1:35:01] misunderstood his life. You know Jesus
[1:35:04] had brothers.
[1:35:08] And you know that none of his family and
[1:35:10] his earthly ministry accepted his
[1:35:13] ministry until he was crucified on the
[1:35:16] cross until God revealed his glory in
[1:35:18] him. His own family, his own family, his
[1:35:21] mother said, "What? You know, where are
[1:35:22] you? Don't you know we've been looking
[1:35:23] for you?
[1:35:26] He knew what it was like to to have his
[1:35:29] most trusted friends lose faith in him.
[1:35:32] His own disciples forsook him and fled.
[1:35:35] Even one denied that he knew him. And
[1:35:38] finally, you say, "How much did the
[1:35:40] suffering go that far?" Finally, they
[1:35:42] spat on him. Could you imagine being
[1:35:44] spit
[1:35:45] upon? They spit on him. They slapped
[1:35:48] him. They pulled at his beard.
[1:35:51] Oh, they they they
[1:35:55] they mocked
[1:35:57] him. And you know what they did? Then
[1:36:00] they murdered him. So brother Bam says
[1:36:02] there they there the most religious city
[1:36:05] of that day. They the most holy people,
[1:36:07] religious people, crucified the most
[1:36:09] awful death him the most precious gift
[1:36:13] of life God ever
[1:36:15] gave. But you know what? God announced
[1:36:18] beforehand by the mouth of the prophets
[1:36:21] that Jesus should suffer in Acts 3:1 18.
[1:36:24] So Jesus could sympathize with every
[1:36:26] suffering, with every hurt because he
[1:36:29] went through it
[1:36:31] himself. For we do not have a high
[1:36:33] priest, the Bible says, who cannot be
[1:36:35] touched by the feelings. We have a high
[1:36:37] priest who cannot sympathize with our
[1:36:39] weakness. But we have one who has been
[1:36:42] tempted in all ways and all manners. And
[1:36:45] he's a he is a high priest who can be
[1:36:47] touched by the feelings of our
[1:36:49] infirmities. Aren't you thankful for
[1:36:51] that?
[1:36:53] Even the apostle Paul suffered in such a
[1:36:55] way and he feared that they would
[1:36:56] misunderstand it. He writes letters
[1:36:59] through Timothy and and even in the the
[1:37:01] the book the book of Acts, he tells the
[1:37:03] Bible says, "For he's a chosen vessel
[1:37:05] unto me to bear my name before the
[1:37:07] Gentiles and the kings and the children
[1:37:09] of Israel. for I will show unto him
[1:37:11] great things that he must suffer for my
[1:37:14] name's sake you think of men like
[1:37:16] Job didn't make any sense to him you
[1:37:19] know why would it happen in the way here
[1:37:21] was Job a man who feared God a shooty
[1:37:24] evil lived for the Lord making sacrifice
[1:37:27] for his children God gave him seven
[1:37:29] beautiful children a wife a home cattle
[1:37:32] sheep oxen lands his manner and c very
[1:37:35] very uh prosperous man and here was Job
[1:37:38] just going about his normal life. He He
[1:37:41] didn't He wasn't forewarned. Uh he he
[1:37:43] wasn't God didn't Let me tell you what
[1:37:45] you will never find in your Bible. You
[1:37:47] will never find God coming to Job and
[1:37:49] saying, "Hey, Job, listen up. I just
[1:37:51] want to warn you. You're about to go
[1:37:53] through things, buddy, that you are not
[1:37:55] going to understand. I'm going to have
[1:37:57] to take you through some things. You're
[1:37:59] going to lose your children, going to
[1:38:00] lose your house, going to lose your
[1:38:01] wife, lose everything that's going to
[1:38:02] boils come over all of your body. But I
[1:38:04] just want you to know, Joe, before it
[1:38:06] ever happens, just make sure you know
[1:38:08] it's me. It's me, Job. Don't worry.
[1:38:10] Don't fret. I've got a plan. I'm the one
[1:38:13] doing it. You won't find that in your
[1:38:14] Bible.
[1:38:17] But the Bible says Job was just going
[1:38:19] about his normal everyday life, just
[1:38:21] serving the Lord, living for the Lord.
[1:38:23] And little did he know in another
[1:38:25] dimension that he couldn't see, that he
[1:38:27] couldn't hear, that he couldn't feel,
[1:38:29] that he had no connection with, his name
[1:38:31] came up before the throne of God.
[1:38:36] And God was so proud of
[1:38:40] Job. He was so proud of him. Satan says
[1:38:45] going, "Where you been? Going to and
[1:38:47] fro seeking, you know, going into all
[1:38:51] the earth." And God says, "Have you
[1:38:53] considered my servant Job?" Oh yeah,
[1:38:56] Job. Job's just like anybody else. You
[1:38:59] know, they'll serve you as long as
[1:39:00] things are going good and long as they
[1:39:02] got money in the bank. As long as
[1:39:04] there's no sickness in the home and long
[1:39:06] as their children are all right, man,
[1:39:07] they'll serve you. You got to hedge
[1:39:08] around them. But, but you take that
[1:39:10] thing away. I I got Job will curse you
[1:39:12] to your
[1:39:14] face. God says, "All right, go
[1:39:18] ahead." Notice, I want you to realize
[1:39:20] this. Job was never forewarned. He was
[1:39:23] never told. He wasn't privy to the
[1:39:26] conversation. You see in life sometimes
[1:39:28] all we get is one side of the story.
[1:39:33] But I want to tell you there is always,
[1:39:35] brother Brandham said, no matter how
[1:39:37] thin you slice it, there is always two
[1:39:40] sides to every story.
[1:39:42] But in Job's life, he never got the
[1:39:44] other side. He only had one side. It's
[1:39:46] sort of like a phone call that you hear
[1:39:48] and you only hear one side of the
[1:39:49] conversation. You don't know what's
[1:39:51] going on, but you hear one side of the
[1:39:53] conversation, you know. Uh hello. Uh
[1:39:55] yeah. Oh,
[1:39:56] congratulations.
[1:39:58] Congratulations. How much does it weigh?
[1:40:01] Oh, is it beautiful? Do you love it? Oh
[1:40:05] my. Is it diesel or fuel
[1:40:14] injected? You see, you only in life
[1:40:17] sometimes get one side of the story.
[1:40:20] And hearing only one side, you can have
[1:40:22] a complete mystery. and guess what it
[1:40:25] is, think what it is. And sometimes
[1:40:27] that's how our life is. We wonder why
[1:40:29] has it happened? It must be because of
[1:40:30] this, must be because of that. And yet
[1:40:32] God has a purpose in all of it. Let me
[1:40:36] say it again. God has a purpose in every
[1:40:39] part of your life. Everything that
[1:40:42] happens in the middle, he has a part
[1:40:45] that has been ordained for you to play
[1:40:47] out.
[1:40:48] That's why then in John chapter nine,
[1:40:50] the disciples looked at that man who was
[1:40:52] born blind and said the first thing they
[1:40:54] said, "Oh Lord, why was this man born
[1:40:56] blind?" The first thing they go to
[1:40:59] wasn't his daddy. His daddy sinned,
[1:41:01] right? No, his mother, his mama. Surely
[1:41:05] there couldn't be. They could the Jews
[1:41:07] couldn't understand how could a man who
[1:41:09] was a man of God, called of God, chosen
[1:41:11] of God, suffer in such a way. And the
[1:41:15] first thing their carnal mind goes to is
[1:41:18] sin. Why was he born
[1:41:20] blind? Was it his mother? Was it his
[1:41:23] father? I love the words and the answer
[1:41:25] to Jesus. Jesus said, "Neither was it
[1:41:27] his mother or his father." That's not
[1:41:30] why he was born blind. But here's why he
[1:41:32] was born blind. That the works of
[1:41:35] God might be made manifest in his life.
[1:41:38] You know what that tells me? There is
[1:41:40] nothing you can go through in your life.
[1:41:42] There is nothing you can suffer in your
[1:41:44] life that doesn't have this one purpose
[1:41:47] that the work of God. The glory of God
[1:41:51] might be made manifest in your life. You
[1:41:54] ought to take thanks to God and say
[1:41:56] nothing I can go through.
[1:42:00] It's all for one purpose for the glory
[1:42:03] of God in my life.
[1:42:09] Job didn't know. I can imagine his life.
[1:42:12] He didn't know. His friends come to him.
[1:42:16] They said, "Job, why is it happening?"
[1:42:19] You imagine. And one day, trouble starts
[1:42:23] coming. Seven children dead, tornado
[1:42:26] dead. Imagine how bitter that mother
[1:42:29] must have become. Can sympathize with
[1:42:31] her in some ways. He didn't know. And
[1:42:35] here he comes.
[1:42:36] And there's
[1:42:38] these friends.
[1:42:41] You know, sometimes some of those
[1:42:42] friends, they ain't friends at all.
[1:42:46] And for 30 chapters, come on, Job.
[1:42:50] What'd you do? Come on, fess up,
[1:42:53] Job. Come on, Job. Tell us what
[1:42:56] happened. We'll still love you. It'll be
[1:42:58] okay. Go ahead. Spill it out. Go ahead,
[1:43:00] Job. Surely no man of God could ever go
[1:43:03] through these kind of things, man. Look
[1:43:04] at you. your your children's dead. Uh uh
[1:43:07] your your wife to you know has has told
[1:43:09] you to forsake God and curse God and
[1:43:11] die. You call yourself a pastor. Can't
[1:43:13] even have your own family in order. Look
[1:43:15] at your children. Look at your wife.
[1:43:19] So amazing how quickly people go to the
[1:43:21] carnal things and they think that that
[1:43:23] disqualifies you because of that.
[1:43:25] Sometimes some of the most qualified
[1:43:27] people, let me say it this way, you
[1:43:28] ought to hang out with people, not
[1:43:30] people who have all the better roses and
[1:43:32] everything's went good in their life and
[1:43:33] they've just had it all. Some of the
[1:43:35] best people you could put yourself
[1:43:37] around are people who have went through
[1:43:39] some of the darkest test and trials and
[1:43:41] struggles and troubles, but have came
[1:43:43] out on the other side with a testimony
[1:43:46] and a faith still in their heart to
[1:43:48] serve God.
[1:43:55] How? Come on, Job. Tell us what
[1:43:56] happened. Come on, Job. 30 chapters they
[1:44:00] go on the circle. You know what the
[1:44:02] problem
[1:44:03] was? Is that Job didn't know why.
[1:44:08] He couldn't give him an answer.
[1:44:11] Because to even to him, he didn't
[1:44:14] understand it. Why is it taking place?
[1:44:17] He could search his heart.
[1:44:20] He could search his life and he didn't
[1:44:23] understand, Lord, why is this taking
[1:44:25] place? He didn't have an
[1:44:27] answer. And he got to such a place you
[1:44:30] could go read the words of Job. He got
[1:44:32] to such a place to where he don't sound
[1:44:34] much like a
[1:44:35] believer. Job 18, he starts to say, "Why
[1:44:38] was I even born? It had been better for
[1:44:41] me to never breathe the first breath.
[1:44:44] Why must I come into this world?" That
[1:44:46] suffering had got to such a place in his
[1:44:48] life. And let me just say it this way.
[1:44:49] It wasn't making sense to
[1:44:53] Job. Wasn't making sense. How could I?
[1:44:57] How could that happen? Lord, he gets to
[1:45:00] such a spiritual amnesia in his own
[1:45:02] life. He's saying, "God, am I your
[1:45:04] enemy? You charge me with your bow. You
[1:45:07] attack me, Lord. You You come at me." He
[1:45:09] says, "As a warrior comes at his
[1:45:12] enemy." And he's all in a mess. And he
[1:45:14] doesn't know. He didn't know that in
[1:45:16] another dimension there was a challenge
[1:45:18] that was made over his life. He didn't
[1:45:21] know that all the while all the
[1:45:23] suffering that God was working out
[1:45:24] something in his life that God was
[1:45:27] putting something in him that would be
[1:45:29] used as a weapon and as a tool later on
[1:45:32] in his life because my Bible says that
[1:45:34] he lived I think 140 years
[1:45:38] and the Bible says he had grandchildren
[1:45:40] after this is after his his suffering.
[1:45:43] You imagine how many times brother Ron
[1:45:45] Job sat down for 140 years. I wonder if
[1:45:48] he ever dealt with families who had went
[1:45:49] through loss, had lost children. Wonder
[1:45:52] if he had ever went through mothers. I
[1:45:53] wonder how many times he could sit down
[1:45:56] and testify and tell them about the
[1:45:58] troubles that he had in his own life and
[1:46:00] be his life be an encouragement to those
[1:46:03] who were struggling and suffering. God
[1:46:05] took 140 years and he used that
[1:46:08] testimony to tear the lies of the
[1:46:10] devil's kingdom down in people's life.
[1:46:13] He took the very thing that God meant to
[1:46:15] destroy
[1:46:17] him. He took the very thing he meant to
[1:46:20] be his wiping out and he used it for 140
[1:46:23] years to testify about a living God, a
[1:46:27] God, a redeemer who is still alive.
[1:46:34] But now notice he's he's he's
[1:46:36] struggling. Lord, why? You know what God
[1:46:38] does? So powerful. I want you to notice
[1:46:41] this here in in Job. If you got your
[1:46:42] Bible, turn to Job chapter 40. Job
[1:46:45] chapter 40. Don't you worry. I am
[1:46:47] watching my clock
[1:46:51] close. Sister Sirius ain't much of a
[1:46:54] sister. She ain't much of a good one.
[1:47:02] Job gets to such a place in his life,
[1:47:04] it's not making
[1:47:05] sense. And so God says, "All right,
[1:47:08] Job." Angels are saying, "Lord, you got
[1:47:11] to do something. You got to do
[1:47:13] something. Look at him, Lord. I mean,
[1:47:15] come on. C can he go much further? Can
[1:47:17] you push him much further? How much
[1:47:19] further can he go? Lord, it's been years
[1:47:21] and years. Look at all the struggling."
[1:47:23] You know, I could imagine the angels are
[1:47:24] almost wondering, goodness, isn't this
[1:47:26] isn't this far enough? I
[1:47:28] mean, God says, "Okay, I got this. I'm
[1:47:32] I'm going to talk to him. I'm going to
[1:47:34] talk to him." You know what God does?
[1:47:35] God does something that doesn't make any
[1:47:37] sense at
[1:47:38] all. He sits Job down. And I want to I
[1:47:42] want to show you something maybe you
[1:47:43] never read in your Bible. I know I
[1:47:44] hadn't read it before I studied this.
[1:47:46] Didn't even know it was in my Bible. I
[1:47:47] want to read you something I guarantee
[1:47:48] you most of you didn't even know was
[1:47:50] there.
[1:47:53] He tells Job, he says, "Job," here's Job
[1:47:55] in all, he's all in a struggle in a
[1:47:58] cloud over his life. He says, "Job, I
[1:48:00] want you to think about something, okay,
[1:48:02] God?" And he says here in in in chap Job
[1:48:05] chapter 40, and God is going to give him
[1:48:08] two animals that he wants him to
[1:48:11] consider. A
[1:48:17] hippopotamus. Did you say that right,
[1:48:18] Brother Matt?
[1:48:20] Yeah. a
[1:48:22] hippo. He says he gives him a
[1:48:24] hippopotamus and a crocodile. Now, these
[1:48:28] are not just your normal hippopotamus or
[1:48:30] your crocodile, but actually, if you go
[1:48:32] look this up, these were like
[1:48:35] prehistoric dinosaurs is what you'd call
[1:48:37] them a dinosaur. Wasn't a normal hippo.
[1:48:40] But the Bible calls him in verse 15,
[1:48:42] look at it together, a bohemoth. He
[1:48:44] says, "Behold now,
[1:48:47] Bohemoth." Bohemoth. God, what are you
[1:48:50] angels got to be thinking? What? Where
[1:48:51] are you going with
[1:48:54] this? A a a hippopotonomous. Just hold
[1:48:57] on, guys. Hold on. Stay with me.
[1:49:04] Behold now the hippo bohemoth. Think
[1:49:07] about him. Job. Think about him. He
[1:49:10] eateth grass as an ox. Lo, now his
[1:49:12] strength is in his loins, and his forth
[1:49:14] is in the navl of his belly. He moveth
[1:49:16] his tail like a cedar. The senur of his
[1:49:18] stones are wrapped together. His bones
[1:49:19] are as strong pieces of brass. His bones
[1:49:21] are like bars of iron. He is the chief
[1:49:23] of the ways of God. He that made him can
[1:49:25] make his sword to approach unto him.
[1:49:26] Surely the mountains, notice verse 21,
[1:49:29] he lith under the shady tree, and the
[1:49:30] covert of the reeds, the shady trees
[1:49:32] cover him with their shadow, with the
[1:49:33] willowbrooks can pass him. Behold, he
[1:49:35] drinkketh up a river and hates us not.
[1:49:37] He trusted he could draw up the Jordan
[1:49:39] into his mouth. Notice this here. He's
[1:49:42] showing the power, the brute might, the
[1:49:45] force of this
[1:49:48] monster. He's saying, "Job, I want you
[1:49:51] to think about this
[1:49:53] monster." And he says, "Okay, I'm not
[1:49:55] done there. Go to Job chapter 41. I want
[1:49:58] you to consider now Leviathan like a
[1:50:00] prehistoric crocodile." Have you thought
[1:50:03] about the Leviathan, Job, here for a
[1:50:05] moment? And he says, "Can you draw I got
[1:50:08] a question for you, Job. Can you draw
[1:50:10] out Leviathan with a hook or his tongue
[1:50:12] with a cord which thou let us down? Can
[1:50:15] you put a hook through his nose and bore
[1:50:17] his jaw through with a thorn? Will he
[1:50:19] make you think God can't be sarcastic? I
[1:50:21] got it right here in Job chapter
[1:50:24] 41. Can you put a hook in his nose? Will
[1:50:28] he make supplications unto you? Will he
[1:50:31] speak soft words unto
[1:50:33] you? Will he make a covenant with you?
[1:50:37] Well, thou take him for a servant. Come
[1:50:39] on, somebody. Go put your hand on that
[1:50:43] crocodile. Go ahead. Go try it. Put your
[1:50:47] hand on that hippopotamus. The
[1:50:48] hippopotamus kills more people in Africa
[1:50:50] than any lion ever
[1:50:54] could. And that crocodile, he says, go
[1:50:56] ahead, Job. Let me ask you, he says in
[1:50:58] verse five, I got it further. Will you
[1:51:00] play with him as with a bird?
[1:51:05] Or will you bind him for thy maidens?
[1:51:08] Shall the companions make a banquet of
[1:51:10] him? Shall they part him among the
[1:51:12] merchants? Can you fill his skin with
[1:51:14] barbed irons or his head with fish
[1:51:16] spears? And then he says, "Lay thy hand
[1:51:19] upon
[1:51:20] him. Remember the
[1:51:25] battle." What's he trying to get Job to
[1:51:27] see? Job, I want to tell you that there
[1:51:31] are monsters that will come in your
[1:51:34] life.
[1:51:37] And if you try to wrestle with the
[1:51:40] monster,
[1:51:41] it will destroy you.
[1:51:44] Job, you will die in the
[1:51:48] Y. If you try to tangle with that
[1:51:52] behemoth, I want you to know Job, he
[1:51:55] says, I will not notice here in in verse
[1:51:57] in verse 8, behold the hope of him is in
[1:51:59] vain. Shall not one be cast down even at
[1:52:03] the sight of him so fierce. Who can
[1:52:06] discover verse 13 the face of his
[1:52:08] garment? Who can open verse 14 the face
[1:52:10] of his door? His teeth are terrible. His
[1:52:13] scales are his pride shut up together as
[1:52:16] with a close seal. One is so near to
[1:52:18] another that no air can come between
[1:52:20] them. They are joined one to another.
[1:52:22] What's God doing? He's detailing this
[1:52:25] that Job, this is a monster. You will
[1:52:27] face a monster in your life. And Job, I
[1:52:30] want to tell you like many other people
[1:52:32] who have tried to wrestle and wrestle.
[1:52:34] Why must I go through this? Why did this
[1:52:36] happen to me? And Job, I want you to
[1:52:38] know, if you try to fight him on your
[1:52:40] own, he will he will eat you up. He will
[1:52:44] spit you out. He'll leave you bitter.
[1:52:46] Come on, somebody. He'll leave you
[1:52:48] broke. He'll leave you angry. He'll
[1:52:50] leave you with malice.
[1:52:53] He'll make your heart so hateful if you
[1:52:57] try to wrestle. But I got news for you,
[1:52:59] Job. I created the alligator. I created
[1:53:03] the hippopotamus. And I want you to know
[1:53:05] today, Job. I am the God of your
[1:53:09] monsters.
[1:53:12] And you can't fight him, Job. But I am
[1:53:15] the God who can put a hook in the nose
[1:53:18] of Leviathan. I can put a cord upon his
[1:53:21] neck. I can make him obey me.
[1:53:28] Hallelujah. I'm the God of your
[1:53:30] monsters, Job. And when it doesn't make
[1:53:33] sense, I've always got a plan for your
[1:53:38] life. Why does God let troubles come?
[1:53:40] God puts pits in his mouth, makes it
[1:53:43] obey him.
[1:53:45] And those trials make us closer to the
[1:53:48] Lord Jesus. Satan doesn't realize this
[1:53:52] that everything he attacks us with in
[1:53:54] the plan of God only brings us closer to
[1:53:57] the purpose that God had in our life.
[1:54:04] Doesn't always make sense. Can I go to
[1:54:06] five more minutes?
[1:54:09] Doesn't always make sense. Okay, Siri,
[1:54:11] what you got to say? Okay, thank you.
[1:54:13] Got a little bit more time. Even she
[1:54:15] says I
[1:54:18] do. Doesn't always make sense to
[1:54:21] jump. Why did it happen? You know, this
[1:54:24] is what Satan couldn't understand. You
[1:54:27] find this in the Bible. Every time God's
[1:54:28] family, you will always find one
[1:54:30] principle. God's army was always
[1:54:32] outnumbered. All right. They was always
[1:54:35] out, always outsourced, always out want
[1:54:37] more swords to go to battle, they always
[1:54:40] was less. God was always moving them
[1:54:42] towards something. You think even the
[1:54:44] temple that he moves them towards. And
[1:54:46] the first, if you could go to the first
[1:54:47] slide, the first here's a tabernacle of
[1:54:50] great beauty. And God says, Moses, build
[1:54:52] me a house, a tabernacle. Look at how
[1:54:54] grand it is. Look at how large it is
[1:54:56] with the inner court, the outer court,
[1:54:58] the holiest place. And God says, this is
[1:55:00] this isn't my vision. Now I want you to
[1:55:02] notice that's a wonderful thing. But I
[1:55:05] want God I want you to know God's saying
[1:55:07] this is not my final thought. This is
[1:55:09] not my final mature. This is not my
[1:55:12] final step. But this is a step in the
[1:55:14] right direction because prior heaven had
[1:55:16] been closed. Man had been cut off. So
[1:55:19] God creates this house and he's moving
[1:55:22] towards something called a
[1:55:24] temple. Jews are looking for it today
[1:55:26] the third temple to be restored. But
[1:55:28] here was the first. And notice it's
[1:55:30] grand. It's granduous. says splendor.
[1:55:32] But God says Moses created and now God
[1:55:35] starts that connection. But then he
[1:55:37] moves from that connection and he goes
[1:55:39] and we know that that temple doesn't
[1:55:40] stay there. But David desired to build a
[1:55:43] house for the Lord. But God says you
[1:55:45] can't. You're a man of war. So uh that
[1:55:47] he he gives him the next temple and
[1:55:49] that's Solomon's temple. You could
[1:55:51] advance it. That's Solom this is this is
[1:55:53] Solomon's temple. I want to make sure I
[1:55:55] pull it up here correctly. And notice
[1:55:57] this here. This was a of great glory, of
[1:56:00] great splendor. Go to I think it's the
[1:56:02] Let me Let me make sure before you
[1:56:04] advance it here. I got it right on my
[1:56:05] side. Yes. Go to the next one. This is
[1:56:07] just a modern-day rendition of it.
[1:56:09] Beauty, glory. You could think of the
[1:56:11] grandeur, but I want you to notice one
[1:56:13] important attribute. It was
[1:56:16] smaller. It had gotten a little bit
[1:56:18] smaller, but the beauty and the glory of
[1:56:21] Solomon's house was like none other, the
[1:56:23] Bible says. So though it was smaller,
[1:56:26] the glory yet was greater.
[1:56:30] It was further a further step towards
[1:56:34] his original plan. And Solomon's
[1:56:36] beauties, you know, the prayer there
[1:56:38] that Solomon prays and says, "God, come
[1:56:40] and come and fill this house." And the
[1:56:42] Bible says that the Holy Ghost, the
[1:56:44] presence of God, the shakina came down
[1:56:46] and and filled up the house. And but let
[1:56:48] me just let me just say this, my
[1:56:50] brother, my sister, that that might be
[1:56:51] beautiful. And you might think, all the
[1:56:53] splendor and all the glory and all the
[1:56:56] gold and man, all the all the all the
[1:56:58] splendor and the the the, you know, the
[1:57:00] colors and the ruby and the carbuncle
[1:57:02] and the onyx and the sapphire and the
[1:57:04] barrel and all of the emerald and all of
[1:57:06] the curtains and all of the scarlet and
[1:57:08] all of the linen. Man, it was just so
[1:57:10] beautiful on the outside. But can I ask
[1:57:13] you a question? What was the real beauty
[1:57:16] of the
[1:57:17] temple? Let me ask you it in a different
[1:57:20] way. If you
[1:57:23] removed the presence of God,
[1:57:27] then what beauty was it really?
[1:57:31] Do you realize what we would have if
[1:57:33] you'd have all of the all of this all of
[1:57:35] the signets and all of the gold and all
[1:57:37] of the all of the, you know, onx and
[1:57:39] barrel and the pillars and the outer? If
[1:57:41] you took the shikina glory out of the
[1:57:44] midst of the inner court, then what did
[1:57:46] you have?
[1:57:48] You had a good dress code. You had good
[1:57:50] rules of dos and don'ts. You had a good
[1:57:53] outward picture. Listen friends, do we
[1:57:55] realize when we remove the presence of
[1:57:58] God, as brother Brandham said that
[1:58:00] Israel, if you remove the presence of
[1:58:02] God from Israel, they were just like any
[1:58:05] other nation. You took the presence and
[1:58:07] the anointing of God out of Samson, he
[1:58:09] was like any other man. And brother
[1:58:11] Brandham says, "And if you remove the
[1:58:12] presence of God from the church, it is
[1:58:15] just a name of a church with the name of
[1:58:17] God attached to it." I say we ought to
[1:58:20] have the presence of the living God
[1:58:22] moving amongst us. That is the glory of
[1:58:28] God. That is the splendor. That is the
[1:58:33] glory. Some people might call a, you
[1:58:35] know, success, you know, oh wow, the
[1:58:37] outward beauty. Some people say, "Oh, a
[1:58:39] successful man is a man who's got
[1:58:41] $10,000 in his in his savings account.
[1:58:44] He's got the greatest house and largest
[1:58:46] home." And you know, that's so amazing
[1:58:47] to me. I've always found with people,
[1:58:49] they will always chase after what they
[1:58:51] call success, but it's all what you deem
[1:58:54] successful.
[1:58:56] And I've watched people who think, oh,
[1:58:58] you know, a good dad, a successful dad
[1:59:00] is a dad who raises his kids to be
[1:59:02] doctors and lawyers. Hey, I'm not
[1:59:03] picking on any of that, man. But, you
[1:59:05] know, a good successful, you know, I've
[1:59:07] seen it in pride in men. You know, I'm a
[1:59:09] successful, you know, when my wife has a
[1:59:11] 10 karat diamond ring on her hand,
[1:59:12] somehow that's a reflection of the man's
[1:59:14] worth or his self by the ring that she
[1:59:16] has. I'm not against a big ring, sister.
[1:59:18] Don't you
[1:59:19] worry. But some people call that the
[1:59:22] success. They think that a successful
[1:59:24] home is a big great big home with, you
[1:59:26] know, all kinds of, you know, uh, uh,
[1:59:29] you know, splendor and grandeur and the
[1:59:31] nicest neighborhood and gated
[1:59:32] communities and, you know, success is
[1:59:34] when I'm driving that whatever you call
[1:59:36] it that that I won't even start to name
[1:59:38] cars, but you know, that that that nice
[1:59:40] vehicle and, you know, I got 10 of them
[1:59:42] and man, I I'll really be successful
[1:59:44] then. You know, they chase after that.
[1:59:46] You got churches who they think success
[1:59:48] is when they're, you know, they're
[1:59:49] breaking down the walls and building all
[1:59:51] kinds of great big buildings and they
[1:59:53] got all kinds of programs and oh boy,
[1:59:55] we've really hit it when we got a coffee
[1:59:57] shop and the vestibule and we got coffee
[1:59:59] better than Starbucks. And hey, listen
[2:00:00] friends, sometimes I don't feel sorry
[2:00:02] for them cuz sometimes the coffee is
[2:00:04] better than the
[2:00:08] sermon. And sometimes if all they can
[2:00:10] get is a good donut and good coffee,
[2:00:11] then hey, more power to them.
[2:00:15] But that's what some people call
[2:00:17] success. You know, successful church is
[2:00:19] a church where, you know, we we got a
[2:00:21] great big old praise band and
[2:00:23] everybody's got mohawks and hoes with
[2:00:25] jeans with holes in them and and you
[2:00:26] know, a preacher who can so eloquent
[2:00:28] graduated with, you know, from Dallas
[2:00:30] Theological Seminarian, man, he can
[2:00:32] quote the Greek and you know, six
[2:00:34] languages and he's a scholar. Hey, they
[2:00:36] call that successful. That's what they
[2:00:39] look at as the outward appearance of
[2:00:41] success. And so you know what they do?
[2:00:44] They create programs. They create
[2:00:46] culture. They create a church. They pick
[2:00:48] the ve the best man, the finest speaker,
[2:00:50] the best music, the best musicians. I
[2:00:53] mean, some of them playing in a rock
[2:00:54] band on Friday night and in the church
[2:00:56] band on Sunday morning. It don't matter.
[2:00:59] So long as you can perform.
[2:01:02] And that's what they call successful.
[2:01:04] Oh, but can I just tell you that that's
[2:01:06] not what I call successful? Can I tell
[2:01:09] you that I believe a successful father
[2:01:11] and mother is when my children know the
[2:01:14] Lord Jesus. And when I serve him, I
[2:01:17] could say, "What do I call a successful
[2:01:18] home?" Is a home with the presence of
[2:01:20] God. When I come home, I may not have
[2:01:23] much. I may not have great splendor
[2:01:25] things, but I've got an atmosphere of
[2:01:27] the Holy Ghost in my home. I call a
[2:01:30] successful home, a home that has peace
[2:01:32] and unity and love and harmony and love
[2:01:36] one with another.
[2:01:38] [Applause]
[2:01:40] And I say a successful church ain't a
[2:01:43] church with the best of the best, but
[2:01:45] it's got the presence of God moving in
[2:01:48] the seats, moving in the aisles, the
[2:01:51] liberty of the Holy Ghost, the power of
[2:01:54] God to back up his word. That's a
[2:01:58] successful church. You might only have a
[2:02:00] tambourine, but if you got the presence
[2:02:02] of God, brother, you may not be able to
[2:02:05] sing. You may not be able to make all
[2:02:06] you can do is make a joyful noise. But
[2:02:09] let the redeemed of the Lord say so this
[2:02:11] morning.
[2:02:14] God was moving towards his vision. He's
[2:02:17] moving towards his purpose. Notice it
[2:02:19] gets smaller even beyond that. Go to the
[2:02:22] next slide. Here was Haggi's temple. You
[2:02:25] know this story very well in Babylon.
[2:02:27] And they come back. But I want you to
[2:02:29] notice it gets so small that even the
[2:02:32] old time the old folks sorry to call
[2:02:34] them that but the previous generation
[2:02:36] they look at that temple and say you
[2:02:38] call that a temple.
[2:02:42] You call that a revival man you should
[2:02:44] have seen it in my days.
[2:02:48] you should have seen we was in church
[2:02:49] six days a week and morning
[2:02:53] Sunday and they always looked back to
[2:02:55] yesterday and then they started you go
[2:02:57] read your Bible they started
[2:02:59] criticizing the the the the church the
[2:03:02] temple because it was smaller but what
[2:03:04] they couldn't see it wasn't making sense
[2:03:06] to them but though it was
[2:03:09] smaller yet it was greater
[2:03:14] and Hagi comes to them and says don't
[2:03:16] despise the day of small things for the
[2:03:18] glory of this latter house shall be
[2:03:21] greater than the former. And I want you
[2:03:24] to know that's a promise of God that it
[2:03:27] may look like more people. You say, "Oh,
[2:03:28] brother Matt, this message people have
[2:03:30] walking away and they're walking away.
[2:03:32] We're smaller than we've ever been."
[2:03:33] Yeah, brother. But let me tell you
[2:03:34] something. The glory, the quantity may
[2:03:36] not be greater, but the quality of the
[2:03:39] atmosphere, the quality of faith, the
[2:03:41] quality when you get all the unbelievers
[2:03:42] out of the room, then Jesus can do
[2:03:44] something special. And the glory of God
[2:03:47] is greater. The building may be smaller,
[2:03:50] but the power is greater than it's ever
[2:03:52] been before. The glory of this house
[2:03:55] shall be greater than the former.
[2:03:57] [Music]
[2:03:59] Hallelujah. He's moving towards
[2:04:01] something. He moves on down to Herod's
[2:04:04] temple. And oh, it looks great. God's
[2:04:07] taking another step to the next temple.
[2:04:10] And the whole time the devil's watching
[2:04:11] this, you remember that? He's not
[2:04:13] understanding. It's a temple. It's a
[2:04:15] house. It's a It's a It's a dwelling
[2:04:18] place. It's a tabernacle. It's a
[2:04:20] sanctuary. He's trying to figure this
[2:04:22] out. What's God doing here? Shine of
[2:04:24] Glory's dwelling, moving. He doesn't
[2:04:26] know it because it's getting smaller.
[2:04:28] Doesn't look as pretty. Doesn't look as
[2:04:29] nice, not as splendorous. He doesn't
[2:04:32] know it, but the glory is getting
[2:04:34] greater and greater as God's taking
[2:04:36] another step towards his plan.
[2:04:40] And he moves all the way down until he
[2:04:43] comes to the next temple.
[2:04:55] Hallelujah.
[2:04:58] And Jesus says, "I tell you that in this
[2:05:00] place there is one greater than the
[2:05:03] temple."
[2:05:04] Because now what was it? The Bible says
[2:05:06] there was no
[2:05:08] beauty that we should desire him. He was
[2:05:12] calmly, meek, lonely. The
[2:05:16] devil don't make no sense. Move from
[2:05:19] here to here to here. And now he comes
[2:05:22] to fallen
[2:05:25] humanity. That Jesus would literally
[2:05:29] become sin.
[2:05:32] The devil couldn't understand this. It
[2:05:33] was a mystery to him. Because we
[2:05:36] remember we read about it. Had the
[2:05:37] princes of this world knew it, they
[2:05:39] would not have crucified the Lord of
[2:05:41] glory. Had they known that God had a
[2:05:44] plan, as Paul said, the hidden wisdom,
[2:05:47] the plan of redemption was hidden from
[2:05:49] the minds of man. It was hidden from the
[2:05:51] devil because God was moving towards
[2:05:53] victory the entire time. And though it
[2:05:55] looked like a great defeat on Calvary,
[2:05:57] little did the devil know, had he known
[2:05:59] that at the death of Jesus, my children,
[2:06:02] your children would go free, your body
[2:06:04] would be healed, it would bring
[2:06:06] salvation, it would bring deliverance.
[2:06:08] Little had he known that, he'd have
[2:06:10] never crucified the Lord.
[2:06:13] But God blinded him. You know how he
[2:06:15] blinded him? The devil has no capacity
[2:06:18] to understand self sacrifice.
[2:06:24] his pride would keep him from that. So
[2:06:27] he couldn't understand Jesus, God,
[2:06:30] Elohim. That's why the devil said, "Hey,
[2:06:34] where does this man get his authority?"
[2:06:36] Even the demons wondered, "Who is he? He
[2:06:40] speaks with such
[2:06:42] authority." Oh, and it was a mystery to
[2:06:45] Satan, this next temple that he had. But
[2:06:49] yet even it was the very plan of
[2:06:51] redemption that God was going to take
[2:06:54] the very thing
[2:06:55] self-sacrifice and a man is there no
[2:06:58] greater love than a man would lay down
[2:07:01] his life but Satan couldn't understand
[2:07:04] this and within the humanity I want you
[2:07:07] to catch this within the humanity and
[2:07:09] the
[2:07:10] weakness that he himself would become
[2:07:14] sin do you know that that's why the
[2:07:17] brazen serpent was was put in the
[2:07:18] wilderness when they had snake bite. And
[2:07:21] so what' God do? He raised up a pole and
[2:07:23] he put a snake upon it. What was that
[2:07:26] snake representing? Sin judged.
[2:07:30] I'm going to tell you what it
[2:07:31] represented. Christ on a cross. Sin
[2:07:35] judged.
[2:07:37] And when they looked to that snake on
[2:07:39] that brazen serpent, it brought healing
[2:07:42] from snake bite. What was it going to
[2:07:44] be? It was going to heal. I hope you
[2:07:46] catch this today. that Jesus becoming a
[2:07:49] man might have seemed mysterious him
[2:07:51] becoming sin but with that becoming of
[2:07:54] sin and with that humanity and Jesus
[2:07:57] that he came with the seed of God inside
[2:08:00] of brother Brandon said he took a blood
[2:08:01] cell wrapped his life that Zoe segene
[2:08:04] life of God took an egg took a sperm and
[2:08:06] said wrapped that took that blood cell
[2:08:08] put it inside of Mary and listen friends
[2:08:11] he was more than a man but yet he was a
[2:08:13] man he what brother Brandham said it
[2:08:15] this way he was God the God man. He was
[2:08:18] all the prophets was. He was the
[2:08:20] prophets plus. He was man plus.
[2:08:26] You know this is a powerful
[2:08:28] story. I love this so much. I'm going to
[2:08:30] close right here. I promise. I promise
[2:08:32] I'm
[2:08:33] closing. Feel that fresh breath
[2:08:37] of I felt it come in the
[2:08:42] room. Notice here. This is what Jesus
[2:08:44] was like. Go ahead and go to the next
[2:08:46] slide. This is a story of the Trojan
[2:08:48] horse. You know the story, very famous
[2:08:52] troll and you know the story. I won't go
[2:08:54] into it too much in detail. But they
[2:08:57] didn't know, the Greeks didn't know when
[2:08:58] they were accepting this Trojan horse.
[2:09:01] They thought it was a great gift. But
[2:09:03] little did they know the mystery was not
[2:09:06] what was on the outside.
[2:09:09] The mystery was what was locked on the
[2:09:11] seed inside of it.
[2:09:13] Satan looks at you and he doesn't
[2:09:15] understand how you can be the
[2:09:16] bloodwashed virgin uh bought bride of
[2:09:19] Jesus Christ because he sees our
[2:09:20] outside. He sees our mistakes. He sees
[2:09:22] our failures. What he doesn't know is
[2:09:24] the mystery is not what you see on the
[2:09:26] outside. The mystery is what's on the
[2:09:28] inside.
[2:09:30] Hallelujah. And I may not look like an
[2:09:33] overcomer, but I promise you there's a
[2:09:35] seed inside of me that can possess the
[2:09:37] gates of my enemy.
[2:09:40] God knows what he put inside of you,
[2:09:42] brother, sister. He had so much
[2:09:45] confidence that he put the seed of God
[2:09:48] inside your life.
[2:09:51] And he didn't know when he was accepting
[2:09:53] this Trojan horse that it would actually
[2:09:56] be his undoing. You see, the devil
[2:09:58] didn't know that by killing Jesus would
[2:10:02] then take Jesus, God Almighty, and it
[2:10:05] would remove him from this earthly
[2:10:06] dimension and he would descend down into
[2:10:08] hell into the demons and the regions of
[2:10:11] the lost.
[2:10:16] And brother Baron says just of that
[2:10:17] story, they didn't know. You go to the
[2:10:19] next, they didn't know that night that
[2:10:21] inside of that Trojan horse when all the
[2:10:23] men were drinking and drunk and
[2:10:25] partying, oh, we've won the battle. Then
[2:10:27] a little door opened on the bottom of
[2:10:28] that horse. And inside of that harmless
[2:10:31] looking Jesus, harmless looking man that
[2:10:34] was meek and lowly. Yet what they didn't
[2:10:36] see is that the mighty warrior, the Lord
[2:10:38] of hosts, the captain of the Lord's army
[2:10:41] was hidden inside of that weak humanity.
[2:10:47] Brother Brandon says it this way. He
[2:10:48] says, "He descends down into hell." Can
[2:10:50] we follow him just for a moment? Here he
[2:10:52] goes. Where did he go to? Notice this is
[2:10:54] when he was in the grave. When his body
[2:10:57] was laying there in the grave. The Bible
[2:11:00] says that he goes and he preached to
[2:11:01] those who repented not in the
[2:11:03] long-suffering days of Noah. And the the
[2:11:05] brother brother Brandon said it this way
[2:11:07] that his soul is spirited as theophony
[2:11:09] of his own went down. And he says, "Oh,
[2:11:11] just let's follow him just for a moment
[2:11:13] if we could. You don't have this. That's
[2:11:14] all right. Just below the regions." Oh,
[2:11:16] you do good. Just below the regions of
[2:11:18] the mortal being lays the realm of demon
[2:11:20] power. Below that, just above that lays
[2:11:22] the souls of the unjust. Below it lays
[2:11:25] the very domain of Satan, hell. Then
[2:11:27] just above that lays the Holy Spirit.
[2:11:29] Then under the altar lays the souls of
[2:11:31] the just men. The next is God himself.
[2:11:33] One going downward, one going upward.
[2:11:35] The two spirits are here on earth
[2:11:37] influencing the people of this earth.
[2:11:39] And when Jesus died, he goes up down
[2:11:41] there. I can see him on that Friday
[2:11:43] afternoon. I love this. On his death,
[2:11:45] brother Brandham knocks on the door of
[2:11:47] the regions of the lost. Let's follow
[2:11:49] him just for a moment. The door opens.
[2:11:52] There was women was men, young ladies,
[2:11:54] were old. They were all together in that
[2:11:56] hideous place called the prison of the
[2:11:57] lost souls. But in that mournful place
[2:11:59] there, Jesus walked to the door and
[2:12:01] everything had to witness that he was
[2:12:03] the son of God because they had been
[2:12:05] preached to the longsuffering days of
[2:12:06] Noah. Knocks at the door said, "I am the
[2:12:09] one who Enoch spoke of. I am the seed of
[2:12:11] the woman that was to bruise."
[2:12:15] Ah, so now the devil didn't know this.
[2:12:18] This was a hidden wisdom that it would
[2:12:21] actually be I love this. I don't want to
[2:12:23] preach before I get to my point. It
[2:12:26] would actually be the bruising of the
[2:12:28] head would be the headship of the devil
[2:12:31] that he had over our life would be
[2:12:34] stripped at Calvary. Though it would
[2:12:36] bruise his foot, meaning the humanity of
[2:12:38] Jesus. But in the bruising or the
[2:12:40] slaying of the lamb would release the
[2:12:43] life of the blood of the lamb that would
[2:12:46] come back on the worshipper and the
[2:12:48] believer would be free of the grip of
[2:12:50] the headship of the devil. Oh, what a
[2:12:54] plan God had. Brother Benham says, "Oh,
[2:12:57] I am the seed of the woman that was to
[2:12:58] bruise. Every word of God has been
[2:12:59] fulfilled. I've just died yonder at
[2:13:01] Calvary and have purchased my church.
[2:13:03] I'm the one that Enoch spoke of. I am he
[2:13:06] and they was without mercy, without hope
[2:13:08] because they transgressed and the door
[2:13:09] was shut in their face on down to the
[2:13:12] regions of demons on down to the very
[2:13:14] gates of hell. And he knocks at the
[2:13:17] door." Notice this. This is when he was
[2:13:20] in the tomb. His body waiting, the
[2:13:23] resurrection. Notice on the outside it
[2:13:26] looked like he wasn't doing anything. Oh
[2:13:28] my brother, my sister, sometimes it
[2:13:30] looks like he's just laying in a tomb
[2:13:32] and nothing's happening in your life.
[2:13:34] Little do you know, he's fighting devils
[2:13:36] for you. He's destroying the devil out
[2:13:38] of your life. It may look like nothing's
[2:13:42] happening, but God, the mighty conqueror
[2:13:45] is slaying the
[2:13:47] enemy. And he knocks, he says, waiting
[2:13:49] for the resurrection. Notice and he says
[2:13:51] he visited the places. Let's go to the
[2:13:53] next slide. He says he knock he knocks.
[2:13:55] Brother Brandham knocks. So, you know, I
[2:13:57] just happen to believe, brother Ron,
[2:13:58] that you know, it's just me. Take it or
[2:14:01] leave it. I happen to believe that when
[2:14:03] Jesus knocked on the door of hell, it
[2:14:05] wasn't no neighborly, you know, nice
[2:14:07] neighborly knock. I believe it's more
[2:14:09] like the police.
[2:14:14] Not a friendly knock, brother Matt. He
[2:14:17] knocks at the door of hell. when he did
[2:14:19] the devil come out and I could hear him
[2:14:21] say, "Oh, oh, so finally you arrived. I
[2:14:27] thought I had you when I killed Abel."
[2:14:30] You see, when that seed was promised in
[2:14:32] the Garden of Eden, the devil has
[2:14:35] constantly tried to destroy that seed.
[2:14:37] And the death of Abel, the coming of
[2:14:39] Seth was just a death, burial, and
[2:14:40] resurrection of Christ. The seed must
[2:14:42] continue. And he tried to destroy it.
[2:14:45] Said, "I thought I had you when I
[2:14:46] destroyed Abel. I thought I had you when
[2:14:48] I destroyed the prophets. I was positive
[2:14:50] I had you when I beheaded John. But now
[2:14:53] after
[2:14:54] all you I've you've arrived. I got you
[2:14:59] now. Oh, you talk about a bully.
[2:15:04] I can hear him
[2:15:07] say,
[2:15:09] "Satan, come
[2:15:12] here." Sort of like your daddy when
[2:15:14] you're ming up in church. She looked at
[2:15:17] you. I can hear him say, "Satan, come
[2:15:21] here. He's boss now."
[2:15:24] Reaches and grabs the keys of death and
[2:15:26] hell off his side. Hung it on his side.
[2:15:29] I want to serve you. Notice on you.
[2:15:31] You've been a bluff long enough. Satan,
[2:15:34] I am the virgin born son of the living
[2:15:37] God. And my blood is still wet on the
[2:15:39] cross and the full debt has been paid.
[2:15:43] Oh, you have no rights no more. You are
[2:15:46] stripped. Give me those keys. Satan
[2:15:48] didn't know it when he crucified Jesus.
[2:15:51] It would be the unloosing of all of
[2:15:53] God's family, of all of God's children.
[2:15:56] The curse would be broken over their
[2:15:58] lives.
[2:16:01] That's right. Turns around, gives him a
[2:16:02] good old healthy kick, slams the door,
[2:16:06] and says, "Stay in there. I'm boss from
[2:16:09] now on."
[2:16:13] You see, the devil didn't know that what
[2:16:15] he meant for evil, God used for his
[2:16:17] glory.
[2:16:19] The devil doesn't know that every time
[2:16:20] he attacks you, it's only going to bring
[2:16:22] you closer. Listen, friends, the devil
[2:16:24] didn't know when he put Ron Spencer
[2:16:26] through a fire and thought he'd burn his
[2:16:28] body and take him out of this world. He
[2:16:30] didn't know that he'd be breathing fire
[2:16:31] for the rest of his life and every
[2:16:33] sermon he would preach would be a
[2:16:35] knockout punch to the devil. And every
[2:16:37] time he opened his mouth and began to
[2:16:40] preach, he didn't know when he gave him
[2:16:41] cancer what he was going to deal
[2:16:44] with. The very thing that he said to
[2:16:47] destroy him has been his
[2:16:51] undoing. I say every time you stand up,
[2:16:54] brother Ron, and get out of bed, that's
[2:16:56] a knockout punch to the
[2:16:59] devil. Every time you stand behind this
[2:17:02] desk and preach, it's a victory for the
[2:17:05] kingdom of God.
[2:17:07] [Applause]
[2:17:14] Got to close. I promise. Right here. I'm
[2:17:16] not going to be a li
[2:17:18] preacher. Here he starts up. It's
[2:17:20] getting Easter. But oh, there's another
[2:17:23] group. Wait a minute. What about Job?
[2:17:27] Who's Abraham? What about Sarah? What
[2:17:31] about
[2:17:33] Ezekiel? What about those? I love how
[2:17:35] brother Adam says that those who
[2:17:36] faithfully went to their grave
[2:17:38] believing, those who trusted God with
[2:17:41] his word, men like Job, let me tell you
[2:17:43] something about Job. What you will not
[2:17:45] find in your Bible is you will never
[2:17:48] find God after the trial. You will never
[2:17:51] find God explaining to Job why it
[2:17:55] happened.
[2:17:57] You say, "Brother Matt, surely somewhere
[2:17:58] Job 40, Job 41, somewhere God comes down
[2:18:01] and and eventually gives him the other
[2:18:03] side of the story and tells him here's
[2:18:04] why he went
[2:18:06] through. He went his entire life with
[2:18:09] one side of the
[2:18:12] story." And many times in your life, it
[2:18:14] doesn't make sense because all you've
[2:18:16] ever had was why did that happen? Why
[2:18:17] did that take place? Why was I born
[2:18:19] there? Why did why was my daddy this
[2:18:21] way? Why was my mama this way? Why did
[2:18:23] that happen to my child? Why did that
[2:18:24] happen to my dad? And you go through
[2:18:26] those life with your questions. And
[2:18:29] sometimes in life, I'm thankful
[2:18:30] sometimes God gives me the answer. But
[2:18:32] other times, God doesn't speak. And Job
[2:18:35] goes his entire life not knowing
[2:18:38] why. He goes to his grave. With this
[2:18:42] faith, I
[2:18:44] know that my redeemer
[2:18:48] liveth. Job got to the place, oh, I just
[2:18:51] feel like preaching this here. He got to
[2:18:53] the place and he said, "I I I go forward
[2:18:55] and he's not there. I go backwards and
[2:18:57] he's not there. I go to look left and I
[2:18:58] can't perceive him. I can't see him
[2:19:00] anywhere. I'm looking. What was he
[2:19:01] saying? I'm trying to find God's hand in
[2:19:03] all of this." And I just, Brother Matt,
[2:19:05] to be honest, I can't I can't understand
[2:19:07] why God I've tried to make sense of it.
[2:19:09] I've tried to figure it out. I look left
[2:19:11] and it's not there. I look right, I look
[2:19:13] up, I look down. And Job got to the
[2:19:15] place to where he was so bewildered
[2:19:16] because he couldn't see God. But you
[2:19:18] know what? A revelation finally struck
[2:19:20] his heart and he said, "But here's what
[2:19:22] I know. He knoweth the way that I take."
[2:19:24] In other words, I may not see him, but
[2:19:27] he sees me.
[2:19:30] And I know that when he has tried me,
[2:19:32] I'll come forth as pure gold.
[2:19:37] And brother says, "Where is Job? Where
[2:19:40] is Abraham? Where's those that trusted
[2:19:42] God? Did death annihilate them? Did he
[2:19:44] forget about them? Was it all over? Was
[2:19:46] it all over? Oh, I can see them. Let's
[2:19:49] take a little peep into paradise and
[2:19:51] look over there. I can hear God come to
[2:19:54] the door. Now, this door, this knock was
[2:19:57] not a a banging. It was a very, I
[2:19:59] believe, very gentle knock like a
[2:20:02] neighbor coming to your door. And
[2:20:05] brother Brandham says, Abraham says,
[2:20:07] Sarah, did you hear that? I did. Go see
[2:20:10] who's at the door. Abraham walks over to
[2:20:13] the door. I could imagine as he opens
[2:20:15] that
[2:20:16] door and his
[2:20:20] eyes got about that big.
[2:20:25] Sarah, Sarah,
[2:20:28] Sarah, Sarah, that's that's
[2:20:31] you. That's the one who met me under the
[2:20:34] oak tree that day. That's the one who
[2:20:37] gave me that promise that day. I can see
[2:20:40] Abraham about that time. He says,
[2:20:41] "Honey, look here. That's the very same
[2:20:43] one that stood with me. Just then I see
[2:20:45] Daniel stand up and Daniel stood up and
[2:20:47] said, "No, no, no, Abraham. That that's
[2:20:49] the one that was the rock that was
[2:20:52] heuned out of the mountain just as
[2:20:54] certain as I'm standing here." About
[2:20:55] that time, here was Ezekiel and said,
[2:20:57] "No, boys. That's not him. That's him
[2:20:59] coming. That's the wheel in the middle
[2:21:01] of the wheel that I seen." About that
[2:21:03] time, Shadrach says, "Oh, no, brothers.
[2:21:05] You got it all wrong. That's the fourth
[2:21:06] man that was in the fire." Daniel says,
[2:21:09] "No, sir. That was the man who showed up
[2:21:11] in the lion's den.
[2:21:14] But about that time, I love how Brother
[2:21:16] Brandham says this. I see Job raise
[2:21:22] up. And you can imagine the feeling of
[2:21:26] looking into the eyes of his redeemer
[2:21:30] because now he had the other side of the
[2:21:34] story.
[2:21:37] And every question he ever asked, let me
[2:21:39] tell you, my brother, my sister, every
[2:21:41] question you've ever had in your life,
[2:21:43] one day you're going to get an answer
[2:21:44] to. You may go this entire life never
[2:21:47] having the answer on this side, but one
[2:21:49] day there's coming a reckoning day when
[2:21:51] it'll wipe all tears away from your
[2:21:53] eyes, and it will all make sense on that
[2:21:56] day. Oh, and my brother, my sister, let
[2:21:59] me say, notice Daniel said he was this.
[2:22:02] Job said he was this. Abraham said he
[2:22:04] was this. Notice to each one of them,
[2:22:06] Brother Ron, he was someone different,
[2:22:10] yet he was the same God. Oh, on that
[2:22:14] day, you say, "Brother Matt, what will
[2:22:15] you do when you see him? I I know this.
[2:22:17] I don't have a clue what I'll do, but I
[2:22:19] promise you this. I'm going to be
[2:22:20] shouting. I don't know if I'll scream. I
[2:22:22] don't know if I'll Some of you have
[2:22:24] never moved an inch in your life. I
[2:22:25] promise you won't be able to be still on
[2:22:27] that day. Some people who's never raised
[2:22:29] your voice, you won't be able to contain
[2:22:31] it. It'll be like a thunder coming out
[2:22:33] of your soul. And he'll be something. He
[2:22:36] might be someone totally different to
[2:22:38] you than he is to me. But he'll be my
[2:22:40] redeemer. He'll be my healer. He'll be
[2:22:43] my savior. He'll be our
[2:22:47] brother. Oh, and brother Brandham says
[2:22:49] Jesus says, "Yes, brothers. It is
[2:22:53] me. I'm the one who you waited for. I'm
[2:22:57] the one who you died in expectation and
[2:22:59] in faith with. I'm the one. And brother
[2:23:01] Random ends it this way. Let's go up.
[2:23:03] Oh, I love that. I just want to preach
[2:23:05] it today and say, "This world ain't got
[2:23:08] nothing on me. It ain't got nothing here
[2:23:10] for me. It ain't got nothing here but
[2:23:12] trouble and trial and tribulation. But
[2:23:14] one day, coming very soon, I'm going to
[2:23:17] take my flight out of this dimension,
[2:23:19] out of this world of pain and stress and
[2:23:22] and disease and sickness. One day we'll
[2:23:25] put our foot over on the head of that
[2:23:27] devil that's bothered us and bothered
[2:23:29] our children and attacked our body. One
[2:23:32] day we'll get the victory over that
[2:23:34] devil.
[2:23:36] Oh, are you looking forward to that day,
[2:23:38] my brother, my sister? Are you looking
[2:23:40] forward to that
[2:23:43] day? That day when it will
[2:23:46] all make sense.
[2:23:53] Bow your heads with me. Musicians, could
[2:23:55] you come? I just feel to close this way
[2:23:56] and I'll turn it back
[2:23:59] over. Maybe you're here today
[2:24:01] and you could so relate to this and say,
[2:24:06] "Brother Matt, I've had things happen in
[2:24:08] my life and got to be honest, it hasn't
[2:24:10] always made
[2:24:13] sense. Like you, I've asked questions,
[2:24:16] very same questions in my life. Why did
[2:24:18] it happen?
[2:24:21] What? What did I do wrong? Where did I
[2:24:25] go wrong? What decision could I have
[2:24:27] made that would have made it different?
[2:24:29] And now I'm
[2:24:31] living living with the consequence of
[2:24:34] that
[2:24:35] choice. What could I do, brother Matt?
[2:24:37] It doesn't make sense to me why why this
[2:24:40] is I I know that I love the Lord. I I
[2:24:43] know that I want him in all parts of my
[2:24:45] life. I know that I believe his word.
[2:24:48] But if I'd be honest here today,
[2:24:51] sometimes it just doesn't make
[2:24:54] sense. Sometimes I question and I'm like
[2:24:58] Job. Sometimes I I don't have the
[2:25:01] answers to all my questions. And
[2:25:03] sometimes I spend the night spend the
[2:25:06] middle of the night, the devil will come
[2:25:07] and attack me and begin to attack my
[2:25:09] mind and whisper and put thoughts in my
[2:25:11] ear.
[2:25:14] [Music]
[2:25:16] And sometimes I just got to be honest. I
[2:25:18] don't have it all figured
[2:25:21] out. I know I'm a believer, but uh I
[2:25:24] don't always
[2:25:29] understand. But today, I want to be able
[2:25:32] to raise my hand and say it this way.
[2:25:35] Lord, though I may not see you, though I
[2:25:38] may not feel you, though I may not be
[2:25:41] able to hear you, though you may seem a
[2:25:44] million miles away, I want you to know,
[2:25:46] Lord, I still believe in you. I still
[2:25:49] trust you. I still long for you. Lord, I
[2:25:53] still give you every part of my life.
[2:25:55] Every question of my life, I lay it down
[2:25:57] right now. I don't want to die in the
[2:26:00] why. I want to have an assurance like
[2:26:02] Job. I want to be able to I have a faith
[2:26:04] that says though I may not understand my
[2:26:06] father what might seem like a cruel
[2:26:08] fate. I'm not going to move. I'm not
[2:26:10] going to I'm not going to be hasty. I'm
[2:26:13] It's only God, I'm going to wait. How
[2:26:15] many can say that today? Lord, help me
[2:26:17] to wait on the fulfillment of your
[2:26:18] promise. Lord, don't let me get
[2:26:20] discouraged and weary and welloing.
[2:26:22] Don't let me faint, Lord God, and trying
[2:26:24] to serve you, Lord. But today, I I just
[2:26:27] want to raise my hand and say, "Lord,
[2:26:29] I'm in need of a fresh surge of the Holy
[2:26:32] Spirit in my life. I'm in need of a
[2:26:34] fresh breeze of Calvary to blow over my
[2:26:37] soul once again, Lord. Oh, come and make
[2:26:40] it fresh. Come and make it real one more
[2:26:42] time in my life, oh God. Lord, may those
[2:26:44] questions, the monsters of that bohemoth
[2:26:47] and that Leviathan, Lord, that would
[2:26:49] want to destroy our life. May we know
[2:26:51] today that you are the creator of every
[2:26:54] trial, every test, every trouble,
[2:26:56] everything that we can go through. You
[2:26:58] have ordained it for our life. And you
[2:27:00] know what you're doing with our life.
[2:27:03] And you will make all things beautiful
[2:27:05] in your time. If only we would wait on
[2:27:08] you. Granted, Lord Jesus, I pray I pray
[2:27:11] for each one. And I wonder if you just
[2:27:13] would put your hand over on that one
[2:27:14] beside you. We draw strength one from
[2:27:17] another and say, "Lord, help my brother.
[2:27:20] Help my sister when it doesn't make
[2:27:22] sense. When we don't have all the
[2:27:23] answers, Lord, I pray you'd come and be
[2:27:26] an encouragement to them. Come and
[2:27:28] minister, Lord. Send ministering spirits
[2:27:30] to them. God, lift them up. I pray, oh
[2:27:32] God. May an anointing, a fresh
[2:27:34] anointing, Lord, God, of joy sweep over
[2:27:37] their soul. May a fresh anointing of
[2:27:39] strength and endurance and patience. Oh,
[2:27:42] have you heard about the patience, the
[2:27:44] perseverance of Job? He went his whole
[2:27:47] life not knowing. But I'm going to tell
[2:27:48] you what, my brother, my sister, he had
[2:27:50] a hundred years to tell the testimony
[2:27:52] that God had not only did Job get his
[2:27:55] children, he got grandchildren. Not only
[2:27:57] did he get his cattle, he got more
[2:27:59] cattle than he had. Everything he lost,
[2:28:02] God restored it back double and
[2:28:04] triplefold. And God's here to tell you
[2:28:06] tonight, everything that you might have
[2:28:08] lost in this life, just hold on. God's
[2:28:11] going to restore it tenfold in your
[2:28:13] life. Oh Jesus, every hand up, every eye
[2:28:17] closed. Lord God, we look to you now.
[2:28:20] You are our strength. You are our
[2:28:22] refuge. You are our hope. Oh, you're our
[2:28:25] mighty tower, strong tower that the
[2:28:27] righteous run into and are saved. David
[2:28:30] says, "Magnify the Lord with me. I will
[2:28:33] boast in the Lord. I my his praise will
[2:28:36] continually be upon my mouth. Lord, we
[2:28:40] praise you. We worship you. You're the
[2:28:42] God who gives. You're the God who takes.
[2:28:44] You're the God who blesses. You're the
[2:28:46] God who anoints. You're the God who
[2:28:47] encourages. You're a friend. You're a
[2:28:49] redeemer. You're a savior. You are a
[2:28:52] defender. You are a shepherd. You are a
[2:28:54] kind, loving heavenly father. Oh, and
[2:28:57] I'm looking forward to that day when I
[2:28:59] will crown you king of kings and lord of
[2:29:02] lords. My God, my God, God almighty.
[2:29:07] Thank you Jesus. Thank you
[2:29:09] Lord. Thank you
[2:29:11] Lord. Thank you

[3:13:57] Vernon, he shows up.
[3:14:02] My, what a heavenly place we're standing
[3:14:04] in. Brother Matthew, God richly bless
[3:14:08] you, my brother. Godly. Bless you.
[3:14:24] We had originally scheduled brother
[3:14:26] Matthew in
[3:14:29] December and uh just didn't work out for
[3:14:32] things on his end. So we we looked at a
[3:14:35] few different
[3:14:36] dates and this this weekend just had to
[3:14:39] be the weekend. It had to be the
[3:14:41] weekend. You couldn't come in December.
[3:14:44] It wasn't anything on your
[3:14:45] end. Almighty God knew exactly what he
[3:14:49] was doing. And Full Gospel Lighthouse is
[3:14:52] appreciative of the gift that God has
[3:14:54] placed in Brother Watkins. Amen. Why
[3:14:56] don't we give Brother Matthew just a
[3:14:58] hand offering tonight?
[3:15:00] Amen. Almighty
[3:15:03] God has graced us this weekend with his
[3:15:07] presence.
[3:15:09] Now, some of you may have saw some of
[3:15:11] y'all may have saw a tall, good-looking
[3:15:13] dude from South
[3:15:15] Carolina, and you probably was right in
[3:15:18] that. But what I saw was none other than
[3:15:22] King Jesus.
[3:15:25] I kept looking. I said, "I know you're
[3:15:27] in
[3:15:28] there. I know you're in there, Lord." I
[3:15:31] saw him today. I was like those running
[3:15:35] on the road to Dmus. I was with him. I
[3:15:39] stood that close with him. Full Gospel
[3:15:41] Lighthouse, do you recognize what has
[3:15:43] happened this weekend?
[3:15:46] It don't even make sense.
[3:15:49] But you're going to stand up to that
[3:15:50] bully and things are going to be
[3:15:53] different.
[3:15:54] You might be just a little bitty wash
[3:15:56] woman, but it don't make sense. But
[3:15:58] God's going to use somebody to stand up
[3:16:00] to that devil.
[3:16:02] and he's just so happened to choose you
[3:16:05] in this hour to stand up.
[3:16:09] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[3:16:12] Well, that was his first time, but that
[3:16:15] won't be his last.
[3:16:23] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[3:16:26] My full gospel lighthouse, we have been
[3:16:29] blessed by some of the best ministry
[3:16:31] around the world. You know, you can look
[3:16:34] as brother Matthew, brother Matthew was
[3:16:35] so wonderfully taking us through at all
[3:16:37] the things. You can look at their ortors
[3:16:39] and their speakers. They have some great
[3:16:41] points, but they ain't got nothing like
[3:16:44] this message has got. In five minutes,
[3:16:47] he said more than any of them could ever
[3:16:48] say in all their lifetime. So, thank God
[3:16:51] for this message. I'm not going to hold
[3:16:53] you no longer. We just we just recognize
[3:16:55] I want you to I want you to recognize
[3:16:57] what presence that you're in. I'm going
[3:17:00] to I'm going to ask the the deacons as
[3:17:01] they dismiss. We'd like for you to start
[3:17:03] dismissing from the back this way. That
[3:17:05] way everybody can just exit right on out
[3:17:07] and there's no hold up at the back. So
[3:17:09] just now changing. We've already talked
[3:17:11] about it in the back. I just hadn't got
[3:17:13] it to you. But we'd like to dismiss from
[3:17:15] the back and just move move right on out
[3:17:17] as you do and go out reverently. This is
[3:17:20] this is not a pool hall. This is the
[3:17:22] house of God. Go out reverently
[3:17:24] respecting the house of God and just
[3:17:27] trusting Almighty God that he's going
[3:17:29] to he's going to handle your monsters in
[3:17:32] your life. God richly bless you. You're
[3:17:34] dismissed today in the name of the Lord
[3:17:37] Jesus
[3:17:38] Christ.
[3:17:41] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[3:17:44] Hallelujah. I love you Lord and I lift
[3:17:47] my
[3:17:50] voice.
[3:17:52] Hallelujah. I love you,
[3:17:56] [Music]
[3:17:59] Lord, and I
[3:18:02] lift my
[3:18:04] [Music]
[3:18:07] voice to
[3:18:11] worship
[3:18:14] you. Oh my
[3:18:19] soul, re
[3:18:23] Rejoice. Take
[3:18:26] your my
[3:18:31] king
[3:18:33] in
[3:18:35] what you hear.
[3:18:38] [Music]
[3:18:41] May be a
[3:18:44] sweet,
[3:18:46] sweet
[3:18:49] sound in your ears.
[3:18:54] [Music]
