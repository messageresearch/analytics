[1:15:27] his father-in-law
[1:15:28] the priest the media and he led the
[1:15:30] flock to the back side of the desert and
[1:15:33] came to the mountain of god
[1:15:35] even to herob and the angel the lord
[1:15:38] appeared unto him
[1:15:39] in a flame of fire in the midst of the
[1:15:41] bush and then and he looked up and
[1:15:43] behold the bush burned but the fire
[1:15:45] with the fire but the bush was not
[1:15:46] consumed and moses said i
[1:15:49] will now turn aside and see this great
[1:15:52] sight why the bush is not burnt
[1:15:55] and when the lord saw that he had turned
[1:15:57] aside to see

[1:16:10] thy shoes off of thy feet
[1:16:12] for the place where upon thou stand is
[1:16:14] the holy ground

[1:16:18] father of god of abraham
[1:16:20] the god of isaac and the god of jacob
[1:16:23] and moses hid his face from
[1:16:25] from for he was afraid to look upon god
[1:16:29] and the lord said and said i have surely
[1:16:32] seen the afflictions of my people which
[1:16:34] are in egypt
[1:16:35] and have heard their cry by

[1:17:25] egypt and moses said unto god who am i
[1:17:28] and that i should go unto the pharaoh
[1:17:32] and that i should bring forth the
[1:17:34] children of israel out of
[1:17:35] egypt and and he said certainly

[1:18:04] name what shall i say unto them
[1:18:07] and god said unto moses i am that i

[1:18:26] find ourselves
[1:18:27] in a in a desert form we find ourselves
[1:18:30] we find ourselves because the devil
[1:18:31] wants to keep us locked into what we
[1:18:33] used to be
[1:18:34] what we what we used to be and i we
[1:18:36] you'd find it in
[1:18:37] many times we come up short because we
[1:18:39] don't lean on jesus christ amen
[1:18:41] but the i am came to moses here and he's
[1:18:44] telling him
[1:18:45] he's going who am i that i can go out
[1:18:47] there and fight this amen but look at it
[1:18:49] it was jesus christ himself
[1:18:51] god himself he came down and was talking
[1:18:53] to him lift the ear and tell him
[1:18:55] you tell him that i am with you the i am
[1:18:58] when the i am is with you

[1:19:05] a good work amen that is
[1:19:07] what he has began in you a good work is
[1:19:09] inside of you

[1:19:12] of my boys i hope he's watching it on
[1:19:13] the
[1:19:14] on the web but i looked at him and you
[1:19:16] know he was going how can i get a raise
[1:19:17] and how can i do better at my job and
[1:19:19] how can i do this many times it takes a
[1:19:22] personal input from you
[1:19:23] you must diligently go after seeking
[1:19:25] jesus christ amen you must look for in
[1:19:27] the bible and find yourself inside of
[1:19:29] there and i look at it and i said
[1:19:31] you know if you show up every day
[1:19:34] every service amen i looked at my people
[1:19:36] and i preached the same thing
[1:19:38] you show up you're looking for something
[1:19:39] god knows what's inside of your heart
[1:19:41] he's looking for more than just somebody
[1:19:43] to occupy you he's looking for somebody
[1:19:45] to praise god amen
[1:19:46] he's looking for his praises and man
[1:19:48] he's done everything for you
[1:19:50] why can't we praise him amen when we
[1:19:52] look at it we see all the miracles
[1:19:53] around us
[1:19:54] we see things going on the i am is with
[1:19:56] us at all times amen
[1:19:57] i looked at my brother back here he was
[1:20:00] looking for an answer but his answer
[1:20:01] laid inside of him amen it was jesus
[1:20:04] christ
[1:20:05] said you will see miracles
[1:20:08] amen go back to that and you stand up on
[1:20:10] that promise of god that if god spoke to
[1:20:12] you one time and said there's going you
[1:20:14] will see miracles you're going to see
[1:20:15] miracles
[1:20:16] you look at yourself this evening you
[1:20:18] watched a man walk through the valley of
[1:20:19] the shadow of death
[1:20:20] you watched him travel down those trails
[1:20:22] but you see the
[1:20:23] i am talked to him and told him ye
[1:20:27] shall see miracles what if you trust me
[1:20:29] amen if you trust someone
[1:20:31] you will trust them with your life you
[1:20:34] will trust them
[1:20:35] and don't ever think that you're so
[1:20:36] small that god can't see you
[1:20:39] god is so important in your life and god
[1:20:42] moves by his spirit
[1:20:43] if you come by and knocked on your door
[1:20:45] he's not going to leave you when you're
[1:20:47] when you've gone astray you just have to
[1:20:49] ask forgiveness and come back
[1:20:51] many times the devil wants to bond us up
[1:20:53] in chains in a jailhouse
[1:20:54] that always said well you remember you
[1:20:56] thought this and you remember it says in
[1:20:57] the bible that if you thought this that
[1:20:59] this one you know what's going to happen
[1:21:01] what you need to do is get out i see
[1:21:02] devil you lie to me every time you talk
[1:21:06] to a man
[1:21:06] but jesus christ when he talked to me he
[1:21:08] said i'll be with you
[1:21:10] even in you until the end of the world
[1:21:12] right now i don't think there's no end
[1:21:13] to the world yet
[1:21:14] i'm looking at the future of a new world
[1:21:16] coming but i'm looking at it he's still
[1:21:18] in me
[1:21:19] he's still in you amen he's stealing the
[1:21:21] fire fighting those battles for us
[1:21:23] why should we worry amen moses when he
[1:21:26] was walking down through there he was
[1:21:27] probably thinking all i've got's a stick
[1:21:29] my donkey my wife my kids
[1:21:33] what am i going to do aaron what do you
[1:21:35] think he's looking over here what am i
[1:21:37] going to do
[1:21:38] but god was in him and he had a purpose
[1:21:40] within him
[1:21:41] i don't care how the big the united
[1:21:43] states is i don't care how big the world
[1:21:45] the roman catholic church is my jesus is
[1:21:48] greater than anything right there
[1:21:49] and man when he wants to make you feel
[1:21:51] small and say well i look around and i
[1:21:53] see the church and it's all small and
[1:21:54] you know i go into church when i'm
[1:21:56] preaching
[1:21:56] i'm looking at this many people and i'm
[1:21:59] preaching you just as hard as i'm
[1:22:00] preaching to you all
[1:22:01] why because it said where two or three
[1:22:03] gathered in my name that he would be in
[1:22:05] the midst of us
[1:22:06] amen the i am the i am jesus christ
[1:22:09] is in the midst of his people that who
[1:22:11] believeth upon him
[1:22:13] and the amazing grace of god gives you
[1:22:15] that opportunity
[1:22:16] to let jesus christ have his way inside
[1:22:18] of your life that he can move those
[1:22:20] mountains he can touch your life i mean
[1:22:22] you're just not a nobody you are a
[1:22:24] god called predestinated by the word of
[1:22:27] god
[1:22:27] the word lives in you the letter of that
[1:22:29] word lives inside of your life
[1:22:31] and i thank god for that tonight amen
[1:22:33] i'm just not me amen it's jesus christ
[1:22:35] i'm veil and deity amen brother brandon
[1:22:37] puts it like this right here
[1:22:39] god is in man and he's identifying
[1:22:41] himself today in his church
[1:22:43] in a born-again christian god identifies
[1:22:45] himself
[1:22:46] that he remains god and the outside
[1:22:48] world only knows god
[1:22:50] as they see god in you and i and the
[1:22:52] only
[1:22:53] and that's the only way that they'll
[1:22:55] ever know god
[1:22:56] is when we are written epistles as
[1:22:59] epistles of the scripture
[1:23:00] we are read of all men and the life
[1:23:03] that we reflect is what's on the inside
[1:23:07] of us
[1:23:07] that being jesus christ amen that's all
[1:23:10] you could ask for
[1:23:10] though death may come your way i mean
[1:23:13] those sickness may come your way
[1:23:14] the light that lays inside of you is
[1:23:16] jesus christ amen the god would move
[1:23:19] down so thoroughly through you
[1:23:20] that you ain't gonna you ain't gonna
[1:23:22] worry about what the world thinks about
[1:23:23] you
[1:23:24] right now you're saying i want to know
[1:23:25] what jesus thinks about me
[1:23:27] and man i want to know what the lord is
[1:23:29] looking down and seeing me right now
[1:23:31] i want to be praising him i want to lift
[1:23:33] up his name i think about this
[1:23:34] and i was looking and anybody ever lost
[1:23:37] anything
[1:23:37] this is it my 15 minutes is over but you
[1:23:40] look at you see god moving
[1:23:42] and i try to find god in everything that
[1:23:44] i'm looking at now i tell you what i
[1:23:45] work in the machine shop
[1:23:47] i work on some very technical tools i'm
[1:23:49] stupid but they're smart tools
[1:23:51] hey man but so we look at this and we
[1:23:53] see it but i can lose
[1:23:55] i don't lose the big handles i lose that
[1:23:57] little bitty part
[1:24:00] you know them ones but terry when you
[1:24:01] look for that nail that one nail that
[1:24:03] you need it'll fit you find everything
[1:24:05] else but you can't find that one it fits
[1:24:06] right there
[1:24:08] that's the time i start cleaning up
[1:24:10] that's when i start cleaning up i start
[1:24:12] brooming out and i
[1:24:13] start sweeping real carefully because i
[1:24:15] know it's small
[1:24:16] i start looking it out and i get all
[1:24:17] that and i take my i take my whole room
[1:24:19] and i bring it back together into one
[1:24:21] big knot
[1:24:22] and i'm like lord how am i going to find
[1:24:24] it and he brought to my attention
[1:24:27] i got a big magnet and i thought about
[1:24:30] brother branham and how he talked about
[1:24:32] how he saw that magnet come out
[1:24:34] at the end of the day
[1:24:37] here it come and i said god if you
[1:24:39] answered that through him
[1:24:40] you can answer it through me and i got
[1:24:42] to thinking about what dad said right
[1:24:44] there ain't no grave gonna hold my body
[1:24:45] down
[1:24:46] and man i got to pushing that magnet
[1:24:48] across that dirt pile
[1:24:49] it may have been just some of the
[1:24:50] scummiest greasiest dirt there ever was
[1:24:53] but inside that pile there become a
[1:24:55] shaking going on
[1:24:56] there was something coming up out of the
[1:24:58] inside of that that was more than just
[1:25:00] dirt or trash it was what i was looking
[1:25:03] for
[1:25:03] now what i had done before i took and i
[1:25:06] took a substitute
[1:25:07] that was the same size the same look
[1:25:11] everything and stuck it in there and
[1:25:13] that tool wouldn't work at all
[1:25:15] and i got to thinking about a little bit
[1:25:16] deeper brother thomas
[1:25:18] i said it's going to take the original
[1:25:21] we are many member bride of jesus christ
[1:25:24] and as i'm searching through that i'm
[1:25:26] seeing that dirt and it all these little
[1:25:28] metal pieces coming up here and they
[1:25:29] hitting on that metal
[1:25:30] hitting on my magnet i flipped that
[1:25:32] thing over
[1:25:34] and i looked right in the middle and
[1:25:35] there was that little bitty piece that i
[1:25:37] needed
[1:25:38] i said glory to god my boss always tells
[1:25:41] me he said i know when things are going
[1:25:42] right because you get back there
[1:25:43] praising god
[1:25:44] amen when things start going right hey
[1:25:46] man you start praising god
[1:25:48] you know but when you stub your finger
[1:25:49] you start going praise the lord
[1:25:51] thank you lord you know ain't your true
[1:25:53] one but when something comes through
[1:25:54] on the inside that matches up glory
[1:25:58] this is what i'm looking for i'm looking
[1:26:00] for a mighty russian wind to come in
[1:26:03] and the healing and feeling could happen
[1:26:05] and here he comes in
[1:26:06] and i take that piece out and i take a
[1:26:08] piece out was incorrect
[1:26:10] it didn't fit the puzzle it didn't fit
[1:26:13] exactly
[1:26:13] but i took mine that was supposed to be
[1:26:15] there so when you think you're little
[1:26:18] and you're nothing stick yourself inside
[1:26:20] the bride of jesus christ
[1:26:22] i closed that thing up
[1:26:26] took it over there to the tort machine
[1:26:28] and that'll tell you
[1:26:29] when you get to the end it'll tell you
[1:26:32] what you've done right
[1:26:33] it'll tell you what you've done wrong
[1:26:36] and this time
[1:26:37] there wasn't nothing done wrong i passed
[1:26:39] it
[1:26:40] it worked out why because it takes all
[1:26:43] of us
[1:26:45] you may think you're small but it takes
[1:26:47] all of us
[1:26:48] amen moses may have thought he was small
[1:26:51] walking down there against that great
[1:26:53] egyptian
[1:26:54] that that ruled the world but one man
[1:26:58] and the i am stood there
[1:27:01] said let my people go
[1:27:05] he has heard our prayer tonight and i'm
[1:27:08] looking at him every time i think about
[1:27:10] ron dean and
[1:27:10] i think about brother lloyd walls and

[1:28:04] in that temple and you may feel like

[1:31:51] just dropped something in my heart so
[1:31:59] i'd like to speak to you just for just a
[1:32:01] very short time here
[1:32:02] on the power of your story the power of
[1:32:06] your story
[1:32:07] luke chapter 1 and verse 39.
[1:32:12] and mary arose in those days and went
[1:32:15] into the hill
[1:32:16] country with haste into a city of judah
[1:32:20] and entered into the house of zacharias
[1:32:22] and saluted elizabeth
[1:32:24] and it came to pass that when elizabeth
[1:32:26] heard the salutation of mary
[1:32:29] the babe leaped in her womb and
[1:32:31] elizabeth was
[1:32:32] filled with the holy ghost and she spake
[1:32:35] out with a loud voice and said blessed
[1:32:37] art thou
[1:32:38] among women and blessed is the fruit of
[1:32:40] thy womb
[1:32:42] and whence is this to me that the mother
[1:32:46] of my lord should come to me
[1:32:48] for lo as soon as the voice of thy
[1:32:51] salutation
[1:32:52] sounded in my ears the babe leaped in my
[1:32:55] womb for joy
[1:32:57] and blessed is she that believed for
[1:33:00] there shall be a performance of those
[1:33:01] things
[1:33:02] which were told her from the lord
[1:33:06] father we come to you tonight lord this
[1:33:09] very special evening
[1:33:11] lord we have felt your spirit father we
[1:33:13] have heard how great you
[1:33:15] are we've heard about the name that is
[1:33:17] above every name
[1:33:18] we've heard that you're still in the
[1:33:20] miracle working business
[1:33:22] and when you create that miracle father
[1:33:24] you place us in our position father
[1:33:26] that we would stand there in action
[1:33:28] father i pray lord that through the
[1:33:30] chaos of life just now
[1:33:33] lord i pray that our story would ring
[1:33:35] out father throughout the ages
[1:33:37] and lord i pray that you would bless
[1:33:39] this congregation and those that are
[1:33:41] listening on the other side of the
[1:33:42] internet may be on the other side of the
[1:33:44] world
[1:33:45] but i pray father that you would bless
[1:33:47] them where they are
[1:33:48] in jesus name amen you can be seated
[1:33:51] this evening
[1:33:53] the power of your story
[1:33:56] every one of us sitting here this
[1:33:58] evening have a very powerful story
[1:34:01] every one of us have gone through life
[1:34:04] every one of us have
[1:34:06] went through different circumstances of
[1:34:08] life that has made you into the person
[1:34:10] that you are
[1:34:11] you have maybe some of you have been
[1:34:13] been tempted all by all kinds of things
[1:34:16] but i want to point out to the devil
[1:34:18] you're here
[1:34:20] there's a lot of things that you may
[1:34:22] have gone through in life
[1:34:23] but i want to point out to the devil
[1:34:25] you're here
[1:34:27] there's a lot of things that that we go
[1:34:29] through in christian
[1:34:30] in christian life we would think that
[1:34:32] sometimes that that just because we
[1:34:34] become a christian that everything works
[1:34:36] out
[1:34:37] everything works out and everything's
[1:34:38] goody to shoe for the rest of our life
[1:34:40] and it's just peachy
[1:34:42] but sometimes life gets difficult and
[1:34:44] sometimes
[1:34:45] life has a turn in it that that causes
[1:34:48] that causes you to wonder what is god
[1:34:50] doing
[1:34:51] in my life and you think about why in
[1:34:54] the world why would i go through this
[1:34:56] and why would i go through that but and
[1:34:58] it looks like that that
[1:35:00] sometimes you're more you're more down
[1:35:02] than you are up and it looks like you're
[1:35:04] more out than you are in
[1:35:05] but i want you to know that as long as
[1:35:08] jesus is with you
[1:35:09] throughout your story if it don't matter
[1:35:12] how long you've been down he can bring
[1:35:14] you
[1:35:14] up it don't matter how long you've been
[1:35:16] out he can bring you in
[1:35:18] and every person sitting here i'd say
[1:35:20] that if we would ask the question or if
[1:35:22] we would be honest here
[1:35:23] i'd say that every person here would say
[1:35:25] that they enjoy life
[1:35:27] that there's a certain part of life that
[1:35:29] you enjoy now
[1:35:30] now maybe you don't necessarily enjoy
[1:35:32] working or working with a certain person
[1:35:34] but i'd say that 90 of us would say that
[1:35:36] we enjoy working
[1:35:38] we enjoy our family we enjoy our we
[1:35:41] enjoy
[1:35:42] coming to church we enjoy god we enjoy
[1:35:44] our salvation we enjoy
[1:35:47] living for god we enjoy life but as long
[1:35:50] as jesus is there throughout the
[1:35:53] throughout the span of your life now
[1:35:56] we've told this story many times at
[1:35:58] funerals
[1:35:59] but as as as we would we would go and we
[1:36:01] would bury a person
[1:36:03] then we would say that that upon this
[1:36:05] tombstone where we lay this person
[1:36:07] it'll have a date to the day that they
[1:36:09] were born
[1:36:10] and the day that they died but between
[1:36:13] those two dates
[1:36:14] is a dash and that dash represents
[1:36:16] everything
[1:36:18] that they did in life now maybe it was a
[1:36:21] person that was a mother and it would
[1:36:22] typify that dash
[1:36:24] we wouldn't see what that dash actually
[1:36:26] means but to the children that would
[1:36:28] mean everything to them
[1:36:30] it represented what mother was it
[1:36:32] represented
[1:36:33] that she was a good mother a godly
[1:36:35] mother it was her
[1:36:36] story that was laying there abraham
[1:36:39] lincoln
[1:36:40] said in the end it is not it is not the
[1:36:44] years in your life that matters
[1:36:46] it is the life that is in your years
[1:36:48] that matters
[1:36:49] there's a lot of things that will go
[1:36:51] that you'll go through in life
[1:36:53] but as long as jesus is on your side
[1:36:56] it doesn't matter what the test what the
[1:36:59] do what the what the enemy says and what
[1:37:01] the enemy testifies
[1:37:03] it matters what jesus says about your
[1:37:05] story
[1:37:06] satan would like to raise his ugly head
[1:37:09] and talk about your past and
[1:37:11] talk about what you did and your
[1:37:13] mistakes if satan is pointing you
[1:37:15] at your mistakes you point him at your
[1:37:19] future you point him at your strength if
[1:37:21] he's pointing at your weaknesses
[1:37:23] you point him to jesus if he's pointing
[1:37:26] you to sickness
[1:37:27] you point him to isaiah 53.
[1:37:30] if he's pointing you to your mistakes
[1:37:32] you point him to a god
[1:37:34] that wipes away all of your mistakes all
[1:37:37] of your sins
[1:37:38] all of your doubts and the bible says in
[1:37:41] micah chapter 7 and 8
[1:37:43] rejoice not against me o my enemy and
[1:37:46] when i fall i shall arise
[1:37:48] it doesn't say if i fall it says i will
[1:37:51] fall
[1:37:52] and when i fall i shall arise
[1:37:55] and i shall though i sit in darkness i
[1:37:58] shall set in light again
[1:38:00] rejoice not against me satan if i fall
[1:38:03] there's a god that can raise me up
[1:38:06] if you're sitting in sickness rise to
[1:38:08] healing
[1:38:09] if you're setting him down rise to faith
[1:38:12] if you're setting in fear
[1:38:14] rise to love your story is powerful
[1:38:20] and it'll shake kingdoms the prophet
[1:38:22] would say
[1:38:23] that he's just looking for empty vessels
[1:38:26] that he can feel
[1:38:27] and shake the world with
[1:38:30] mary was a little girl 16 years old
[1:38:35] that her story that she was about to
[1:38:38] tell
[1:38:38] and her story that she was about to live
[1:38:40] out would never
[1:38:42] there would never be another person on
[1:38:45] the face of the earth that would have a
[1:38:46] story
[1:38:47] like mary's got and people go through
[1:38:50] life
[1:38:51] and they think you need to hear
[1:38:52] everything that i've went through
[1:38:54] you need to understand where i've been
[1:38:57] you
[1:38:58] have not lived a life like little mary
[1:39:00] had to live
[1:39:02] her story was so powerful
[1:39:05] that that the angel gabriel had to come
[1:39:08] and tell her
[1:39:08] of the story that she would carry out in
[1:39:11] life not only was this
[1:39:12] just a a normal story that would be told
[1:39:16] that you would read to your children at
[1:39:18] the end of the night to put them to
[1:39:19] sleep
[1:39:20] but this is the greatest story that has
[1:39:23] ever been told
[1:39:24] and ever will be told that this little
[1:39:27] girl
[1:39:28] 16 years old had a visitation from an
[1:39:31] angel and that angel told her that she
[1:39:34] would conceive in her womb
[1:39:36] and she would bring for the child and
[1:39:38] she would call his name jesus
[1:39:40] and he will save his people from their
[1:39:43] sins
[1:39:44] there's nobody that's got a story like
[1:39:46] mary
[1:39:47] when mary pushed out what was on the
[1:39:49] inside of her
[1:39:51] it was more than just an average man
[1:39:53] this was not
[1:39:54] part jew nor port gentile the story that
[1:39:58] she was producing from her womb would
[1:40:00] save you
[1:40:01] and save your mother save your father
[1:40:04] save the lost save the drug addict save
[1:40:07] the alcoholic
[1:40:08] mary's story started with an angel
[1:40:12] and that same angel's in this room
[1:40:14] tonight so that he can set your story
[1:40:17] on a course that you can say if you can
[1:40:21] go through
[1:40:22] these things and you can look up don't
[1:40:25] look down don't look back but look up
[1:40:29] he will take you to the spot that he
[1:40:31] predetermined
[1:40:33] his pre-destination has set your course
[1:40:38] when mary begin to tell her story
[1:40:42] there's power in your voice and when you
[1:40:45] begin to testify
[1:40:47] and when you begin to confess what he
[1:40:49] did
[1:40:51] your story is being lived out by your
[1:40:54] voice
[1:40:55] and mary begin to testify to her cousin
[1:40:59] elizabeth
[1:41:00] because the angel had told her about
[1:41:03] elizabeth's story
[1:41:06] what brought you here tonight
[1:41:09] the greatest story that was ever told
[1:41:13] and he is the author and the finisher of
[1:41:16] our faith
[1:41:17] he is the one that starts to work and he
[1:41:20] is the one that finishes the work
[1:41:22] and god is not a halfway god and neither
[1:41:25] is he in the business of creating
[1:41:27] halfway children
[1:41:28] if god has started a work in your life
[1:41:32] he will finish the story there's going
[1:41:35] to be authors that write
[1:41:37] great poets poetry they will write
[1:41:40] great books that will sell for millions
[1:41:42] of dollars
[1:41:44] but when the author writes your story
[1:41:47] and puts the end on it
[1:41:50] it is happily ever after your story is
[1:41:54] not a story of destruction
[1:41:56] your story is a story of victory your
[1:41:59] story is not a story of depression
[1:42:02] nor anxiety your story is a story of
[1:42:06] healing
[1:42:07] a story of miracles a story of joy and
[1:42:11] happiness and peace
[1:42:15] there might be somebody that raises up
[1:42:18] in your story
[1:42:19] and tries to put out your light but god
[1:42:22] is the one that's writing out the script
[1:42:25] and satan can do all he wants to
[1:42:27] to stop the story from coming but god
[1:42:31] knows the end and he knows your
[1:42:34] beginning
[1:42:34] he knows how to write the book
[1:42:38] and as mary begins to echo out of her
[1:42:41] soul
[1:42:42] the things that were laying there
[1:42:46] she began to tell what the angel said
[1:42:50] you ever been in that spot in the spot
[1:42:51] of a story
[1:42:53] when you're talking about more than a
[1:42:55] story
[1:42:56] when you're talking about life when
[1:42:59] you're talking about jesus you ever been
[1:43:00] in that spot of a story when you
[1:43:02] when you're testifying about what god
[1:43:05] did for you
[1:43:07] maybe you've been in that baby you've
[1:43:08] been in that's part of a story when
[1:43:10] you've been telling about somebody
[1:43:12] somebody's real close to you somebody
[1:43:14] went through cancer
[1:43:16] and somebody that was talked to by an
[1:43:18] angel said if you trust me
[1:43:20] i'll use you like never before and you
[1:43:22] begin to tell
[1:43:23] somebody else's story about this big god
[1:43:26] and you begin to tell
[1:43:28] that the doctors seen tumors in lungs
[1:43:30] they sing tumors in brains
[1:43:32] but now here we are on the other side of
[1:43:34] nine months
[1:43:35] and you're telling a story and in this
[1:43:38] story
[1:43:39] the doctors say that there is no
[1:43:42] there is no tumor seen in those lungs no
[1:43:45] more
[1:43:45] and all of a sudden there begin to be a
[1:43:48] visitation
[1:43:49] because of a story that was being told
[1:43:54] let me tell you about somebody else
[1:43:56] there was a man named paul
[1:43:58] that was known as a killer known as a
[1:44:00] murderer
[1:44:01] but one day he met this one that was
[1:44:04] going to finish his story
[1:44:06] not as saul but he would finish him as
[1:44:08] paul
[1:44:10] that would write 14 books of this bible
[1:44:14] and even though satan may hate paul with
[1:44:16] everything that's within him
[1:44:18] what paul was writing was inspired by
[1:44:20] the holy ghost
[1:44:23] it is our word and it will defeat satan
[1:44:26] anytime
[1:44:26] anyplace anywhere hallelujah satan
[1:44:30] wasn't trying to get saul
[1:44:32] when he was on one road but when he
[1:44:34] became paul
[1:44:37] the story changed you remember when your
[1:44:40] story changed
[1:44:42] you remember when it looked like the
[1:44:44] author was writing the book and you were
[1:44:46] just spiraling down a hill
[1:44:48] of chaos and all of a sudden
[1:44:52] the man with the pen
[1:44:57] made a complete change
[1:45:00] in the story maybe your story started at
[1:45:04] altar maybe your story started in a car
[1:45:07] when you were riding home
[1:45:11] but he changed your story
[1:45:15] but he's not writing your story with ink
[1:45:17] he's writing it with blood
[1:45:21] your story has the power to bring life
[1:45:25] when you go to telling about the author
[1:45:27] of life
[1:45:28] and you begin to testify and about the
[1:45:30] creator of life
[1:45:31] that he's the sustainer of life and you
[1:45:34] go to testifying
[1:45:35] about the story and the one that created
[1:45:39] and did a work in your life the name
[1:45:43] that is above every name
[1:45:44] you begin to testify about those things
[1:45:46] there's power
[1:45:48] in your story when mary began to tell
[1:45:52] her story
[1:45:54] there was something happening in a realm
[1:45:57] that could not be
[1:45:58] seen there was something supernatural
[1:46:01] that was happening
[1:46:02] because there had been a promise of a
[1:46:05] prophet
[1:46:06] that would be a forerunner to the
[1:46:08] messiah
[1:46:09] and when mary began to tell her story
[1:46:12] a little prophet that was on the inside
[1:46:15] of a womb
[1:46:15] that had been laying there dead because
[1:46:18] of mary's story
[1:46:20] it brought to life a dead prophet
[1:46:24] oh hallelujah when you go to telling
[1:46:26] about this holy ghost
[1:46:28] that there's power in the name of jesus
[1:46:30] christ
[1:46:31] it'll make dead people leap even though
[1:46:33] they may
[1:46:34] look like they're not in the womb but
[1:46:36] they're in the mind of god
[1:46:38] and you go to telling about the name of
[1:46:40] jesus
[1:46:41] and the power of jesus this story has
[1:46:44] the power
[1:46:46] to raise you out of your sin in your
[1:46:49] life
[1:46:52] she testified in the name of jesus
[1:46:54] christ
[1:46:56] because it was her story her story
[1:47:02] brought life to this world what will
[1:47:05] your story tell in the end
[1:47:09] what will be said of you what will be
[1:47:11] your legacy
[1:47:14] we started out last year with a theme
[1:47:18] that we will see miracles
[1:47:22] did we see them that was a story
[1:47:26] that you testified of before you ever
[1:47:29] seen them
[1:47:31] i want to tell you something that you
[1:47:32] already know faith don't make sense
[1:47:35] faith makes miracles
[1:47:45] satan perverts and he destroys life
[1:47:49] but god brings sons and daughters
[1:47:53] back to their rightful position
[1:47:58] years ago there was an elderly man and a
[1:48:02] son
[1:48:04] this elderly man was a widow man and had
[1:48:07] enormous amount of money but he was a
[1:48:10] very
[1:48:12] very particular man and he collected
[1:48:15] great works of art he cr
[1:48:18] he collected picasso he he
[1:48:22] he collected he collected monet
[1:48:25] and then go and he collected all of
[1:48:27] these things
[1:48:28] and he had created such a museum in his
[1:48:31] own home
[1:48:32] that his son as he watched his son that
[1:48:35] his son
[1:48:36] began to take on his own role of his
[1:48:39] father
[1:48:40] and he how he loved how he loved to look
[1:48:43] at those pieces of
[1:48:44] art and how he loved to collect pieces
[1:48:46] of picasso
[1:48:47] and monet and van gaal and they they
[1:48:50] sent them out throughout their
[1:48:52] monstrous house and they they placed
[1:48:54] them throughout the walls
[1:48:56] and they were watching and they were
[1:48:58] looking at the
[1:48:59] the power of the story that was being
[1:49:02] told in that piece of art
[1:49:04] because great men great men paint great
[1:49:08] things
[1:49:10] and picasso is painting out these things
[1:49:13] and he's
[1:49:13] telling a story and behind pieces
[1:49:16] of art there's a story that's being told
[1:49:19] and this son
[1:49:20] begin to grab a hold of his father's his
[1:49:23] father's vision of collecting these
[1:49:25] pieces of work
[1:49:27] and he the father began to swell up with
[1:49:30] pride and
[1:49:31] how he how he looked upon his son and
[1:49:34] his son would
[1:49:35] go after those pieces of art and he had
[1:49:38] the money to buy them so we'd go after
[1:49:40] pieces that nobody else would have
[1:49:43] well winter came and so did war
[1:49:47] and war came along and
[1:49:50] it come along and his son he got a note
[1:49:54] the father got a note that his son
[1:49:56] was missing in action and the father
[1:49:58] began to
[1:49:59] become very emotional thinking
[1:50:02] here we are we're going into the
[1:50:04] christmas season and
[1:50:06] my son's missing in action and you can
[1:50:08] imagine he's thinking the absolute worst
[1:50:09] i may never see my son again
[1:50:12] a few days later he heard word that his
[1:50:16] son
[1:50:17] the things that he thought was that he
[1:50:19] never wanted to hear
[1:50:20] his son had passed away in war
[1:50:26] he sat there in home and he looked out
[1:50:29] upon his beautiful pieces of art that
[1:50:31] nobody else in the world had but he said
[1:50:34] in a house that was lonely
[1:50:37] without a son without everything that he
[1:50:38] loved
[1:50:40] he had he had all the money that you
[1:50:42] could buy anything that you wanted he
[1:50:44] could buy
[1:50:45] but he had nobody to share his beauty
[1:50:48] with
[1:50:50] his greatest treasure in life had been
[1:50:53] taken from him
[1:50:57] and on christmas day as christmas rolled
[1:50:59] up and the man said in his home
[1:51:02] there was a knock on the door and as he
[1:51:04] walked down the hallway and
[1:51:06] all the pieces of art are just sitting
[1:51:08] there and they're staring at him as he's
[1:51:10] walking down through there and he cannot
[1:51:12] share his love with his son no more
[1:51:14] he walks up to the door
[1:51:17] and there's a soldier that is standing
[1:51:19] there it says sir
[1:51:21] i knew your son i was a friend this man
[1:51:24] had a package in his hand
[1:51:26] so i was the one
[1:51:30] that your son was trying to save and get
[1:51:32] me to a medic when he was killed in
[1:51:34] action
[1:51:35] said can i come in and could i talk with
[1:51:38] you a little bit
[1:51:40] and the soldier began to tell his father
[1:51:43] the father about his son how he loved
[1:51:45] the pieces of art how he talked about
[1:51:47] home and how we talked
[1:51:48] about the art that his father had
[1:51:49] collected about the pieces of picasso
[1:51:52] and van gogh and monet and all of these
[1:51:54] things he began to tell him about these
[1:51:58] and he said sir he said i'm an artist as
[1:52:00] well
[1:52:01] and he said i'd like to present this to
[1:52:03] you
[1:52:04] this piece of art that was drawn out
[1:52:08] was a picture of the wealthy man's son
[1:52:12] this soldier had painted this piece of
[1:52:14] art
[1:52:15] though it may not have been a stroke of
[1:52:16] genius to to great collectors
[1:52:19] but to the father it meant everything to
[1:52:21] him there was his son
[1:52:24] he'd captured his eyes he'd captured his
[1:52:26] he captured his youth he captured
[1:52:28] everything about him
[1:52:30] and as he's looking at it he sees his
[1:52:33] son and they begin to talk about it
[1:52:35] and the father tells the soldier he said
[1:52:37] i'm going to place this piece of art
[1:52:38] right here on the fireplace
[1:52:40] i'll push aside these other pieces and
[1:52:42] i'll set him right there
[1:52:45] sure enough as a soldier left that
[1:52:47] evening the father was as good as his
[1:52:49] word and he took that piece of art that
[1:52:51] that was presented by the soldier his
[1:52:53] son he placed it right there and he
[1:52:54] stared at it and he cried filled with
[1:52:56] emotion
[1:52:57] he's sitting and he's he's looking at
[1:52:59] his son
[1:53:01] on christmas day spring rolls and a man
[1:53:05] becomes ill when he passes away
[1:53:08] and everything and the art world is
[1:53:10] beginning to jump for joy and they're
[1:53:12] excited because
[1:53:14] now they have a chance to buy
[1:53:17] these great pieces of art
[1:53:20] they have an opportunity and the father
[1:53:22] had wrote in his will
[1:53:24] that that you that this auction must be
[1:53:27] done on christmas day when i receive my
[1:53:29] greatest gift
[1:53:32] so auction day pulls up christmas day

[1:53:36] these great men from around the world
[1:53:38] world-renowned collectors of art they
[1:53:39] come to this man's estate
[1:53:41] where the auction is being held and they
[1:53:44] are just the the room and the place is
[1:53:46] just completely full of talking

[1:53:52] how much money that they had brought so
[1:53:54] that they could buy these great pieces
[1:53:56] of art
[1:53:56] they would be the greatest collector put
[1:53:58] them in museums
[1:54:01] and the auctioneer beats his gavel and
[1:54:03] said let us start
[1:54:06] he said we have to start with this
[1:54:07] picture first it's a picture
[1:54:10] of the man's son a voice came from the

[1:54:20] and monet we came here for
[1:54:22] these great things why do we have to

[1:55:34] wheel that whoever takes a son
[1:55:37] gets all the things that he had in his
[1:55:44] house
[1:55:46] the bible said in romans 8 that
