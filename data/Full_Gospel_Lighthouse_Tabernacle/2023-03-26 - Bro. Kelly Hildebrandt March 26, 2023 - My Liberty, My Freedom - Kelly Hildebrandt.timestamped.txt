[52:17] appreciation for her brother Ron and
[52:19] sister Connie and different ones that
[52:21] have traveled to our place and they
[52:23] wanted to be sure that I would give
[52:25] greetings and also our brother your
[52:28] sister Kay my brother Kenton and sister
[52:31] Lorraine who's been here and our church
[52:34] family they all send their heartfelt
[52:36] greetings to each and every one of you
[52:39] uh December 2019 it took sister maram I
[52:42] saw three days to arrive here
[52:45] that was probably the worst trip I've
[52:46] ever had in my life to be honest with
[52:48] you
[52:49] on a plane for all those hours and then
[52:52] they had to turn around and go back to
[52:54] Calgary and
[52:55] well we just we just hopped from one
[52:57] city to another until we finally were
[52:59] able to be here but it was a was a
[53:02] difficult trip when we were in Toronto
[53:05] they actually the person that was in
[53:08] charge there she told us you have no
[53:11] seats on this flight and there's we
[53:13] can't get you on a flight
[53:15] and I just indicated to her that I was
[53:18] going to Camp right by her desk until
[53:20] she found us some tickets to be able to
[53:23] get here
[53:24] and so we were able to find some tickets
[53:27] overnighted in Toronto and then brother
[53:29] Ron Brother Matt and brother Andrew came
[53:32] to the airport in Washington to pick us
[53:36] up from the airport and and be able to
[53:39] come here to be in service that Sunday
[53:41] night that we were here
[53:43] it was all my heart and and
[53:46] this coin that I had brought with me
[53:48] which was a war commemorative coin of
[53:51] Normandy with a pebble of sand embedded
[53:54] into it and uh it was something that to
[53:58] when brother Ron had seen it originally
[54:00] he was he was quite moved by it and I I
[54:02] was able to get another one and bring it
[54:05] with me
[54:06] and on that particular coin it said we
[54:09] will accept nothing less than full
[54:11] victory
[54:12] uh that Sunday afternoon we presented
[54:15] that coin to brother Ron which many of
[54:17] you were here when we did that
[54:19] and we brought a message titled full
[54:22] victory at that time
[54:24] and I believe that's what the Lord Was
[54:27] preparing us for preparing him for is
[54:29] for full victory
[54:31] he not realizing at that time that
[54:33] brother Ron was moving into
[54:35] an incredible battle and a very
[54:37] difficult Journey would begin
[54:40] and we just were part of that beginnings
[54:44] it was later last year May the 7th
[54:49] 2022 that we were able to come here
[54:52] which was something that we didn't know
[54:53] if that would ever happen again of
[54:55] course because of the pandemic but we
[54:57] were able to be here and I brought a
[55:00] statue with me of of David
[55:03] with his Goliath sword drawn with his
[55:06] foot on Goliath's head and I called that
[55:09] statue
[55:11] at that time and I still call it the
[55:13] same your enemy is dead
[55:15] and and I believe that with all my heart
[55:18] uh the the enemy our enemy Satan would
[55:20] try to take our lives if he could
[55:22] but there's one thing that we know for
[55:24] sure is that that he can't do anything
[55:26] unless God gives him the go-ahead to do
[55:28] it
[55:29] and therefore three years that it is
[55:32] right now brother Ron we're just so
[55:34] thrilled to be here together with
[55:36] brother Tim uh brother dawn in himself
[55:39] at that time coming I was encountered I
[55:41] wasn't able to make it at that time
[55:44] March of 2020 to be able to be here
[55:47] because it's a long a long trip and our
[55:49] Airlines were closing down
[55:51] but I'm happy to stand with with these
[55:56] Generals in the army of the Lord
[55:58] and and that they would come and pray
[56:00] and I always appreciated brother Tim's
[56:02] words that he spoke we shall see
[56:03] Miracles we shall see Giants fall
[56:06] I believe that's happening around the
[56:08] world we are seeing incredible Miracles
[56:11] I've heard of many miracles from your
[56:13] local assembly and many miracles from
[56:15] Brother Tim's assembly in our assembly
[56:17] there's many miracles that are
[56:19] transpiring and we know that it can only
[56:22] happen through the through faith in the
[56:24] word of God
[56:25] and and I I say it's a blessing one more
[56:28] time for sister Myra and myself to be
[56:31] here three years into this battle and I
[56:34] say the battle is not ours but the
[56:36] battle is the Lord's and he'll give us
[56:39] the Victory and we believe for brother
[56:41] Ron in his faith journey and we believe
[56:43] and expect nothing else but full Victory
[56:46] we believe that with all of our heart
[56:48] and we believe that giant is dead and
[56:51] we're just moving into that new body
[56:53] that the Lord will have for you our body
[56:56] that's full from all that cancer that
[56:58] you're dealing with amen we can save
[57:00] from our heart we love you dearly your
[57:03] prayer your name is on the top of our
[57:04] prayer request every single service and
[57:07] we just have a deep appreciation we we
[57:10] stand in faith together with this
[57:12] assembly Full Gospel Lighthouse and we
[57:15] stand together in faith with you and
[57:17] your family we love you all with all of
[57:19] our heart amen isn't the Lord he's good
[57:22] to us
[57:23] even in the darkest time and in the
[57:25] deepest battles the Lord certainly is
[57:28] good to us amen if you'd like to stand
[57:31] at this time
[57:33] I'm just going to read a scripture that
[57:35] I've been looking at at home for a while
[57:40] and I trust it'll be a blessing we had a
[57:42] wonderful time last night I hear that
[57:44] some people went home a little
[57:46] intoxicated of the spirit and
[57:48] while they got home there's one nice
[57:50] thing about it is that when you wake up
[57:52] in the morning you don't have a headache
[57:53] it kind of takes away all headaches it
[57:56] takes away all things and we thank the
[57:58] Lord for those kind of times amen
[58:02] had a brother who would contact me on a
[58:04] meeting we were having he said brother
[58:06] Kelly I made it home but we were pretty
[58:07] drunk on the way home
[58:09] I said as long as you keep it between
[58:10] the lines then you're doing okay
[58:13] amen that's the main thing is it
[58:16] wonderful the lord always gets us home
[58:18] we thank him for that Romans chapter 10
[58:20] I'd like to read today if we could turn
[58:23] there
[58:31] verses 11 through 17.
[58:39] for the scripture saith whosoever
[58:41] believeth on him
[58:43] shall not be ashamed
[58:45] or or shall not be disappointed there's
[58:48] no disappointment when you serve the
[58:50] Lord
[58:52] for there's no difference between the
[58:54] Jew and the Greek for the same Lord over
[58:56] all is Rich unto all that call upon him
[59:00] for whosoever and we believe we're part
[59:03] of that whosoever
[59:04] shall call upon the name of the Lord
[59:07] it's very affirmative they shall be
[59:10] saved
[59:12] how then shall they call on him in whom
[59:14] they have not believed and how shall
[59:15] they believe in him of whom they have
[59:18] not heard and how shall they hear
[59:20] without a preacher
[59:23] so by the foolishness of preaching men
[59:25] shall be saved
[59:27] how shall they preach except they be
[59:29] sent as it is written how beautiful are
[59:32] the feet of them that preach the gospel
[59:34] of peace and bring Glad Tidings of good
[59:37] things
[59:39] but they have not all obeyed the gospel
[59:40] for Isaiah saith Lord
[59:43] who hath believed our report
[59:46] so that Faith cometh by hearing and
[59:48] hearing by the word of God Amen God
[59:52] bless you you may have your seats this
[59:54] this morning
[59:56] if I would title my my my text this
[59:59] morning I would title it my Liberty my
[1:00:02] freedom
[1:00:03] My Liberty my freedom I'd like to read
[1:00:07] if you still have your Bibles open and
[1:00:09] in Romans 10 I'd like to read verses 16
[1:00:11] through 17 out of the passion
[1:00:14] translation
[1:00:16] sometimes different translations just
[1:00:18] make the word just a little more
[1:00:20] colorful just brings it out just a
[1:00:22] little better for us than our English
[1:00:24] language he says but not everyone
[1:00:27] welcomes the good news
[1:00:30] Isaiah said Lord is there anyone who
[1:00:33] hears and believes our message and we
[1:00:36] could say this morning that we are I
[1:00:38] hear and we also believe the message
[1:00:40] that God has sent to us in this
[1:00:42] anti-mower
[1:00:43] verse 17 is very beautiful it says faith
[1:00:47] then his birth in a heart that responds
[1:00:50] to God's anointed utterance of the
[1:00:52] anointed one
[1:00:54] Faith then is birthed in a heart that
[1:00:57] responds to God's anointed utterance of
[1:01:00] the anointed ones when we speak of
[1:01:02] Liberty and we speak of Freedom that's
[1:01:04] something that can is only given to us
[1:01:07] by a new birth that we have received
[1:01:09] through our Lord Jesus Christ and God
[1:01:12] has purpose to give us Liberty in all
[1:01:15] parts of our life so when I was young I
[1:01:18] thought I had Liberty but when I really
[1:01:19] came into Christ that's when true
[1:01:21] Liberty became part of my fiber became a
[1:01:24] part of your fiber when we come into the
[1:01:27] into the Lord all the things that we at
[1:01:29] one time we thought were such joyful
[1:01:31] there also become they're so dead in our
[1:01:33] life and we have freedom from all those
[1:01:36] things that actually were destroying our
[1:01:39] very being
[1:01:40] back home in our country they're they
[1:01:42] they have legalized drugs and and all
[1:01:44] kinds of things that they've done now
[1:01:46] and and they're wondering why they're
[1:01:48] such a high suicide rate in this because
[1:01:50] the people are so intoxicated with
[1:01:53] chemical substances is that they can't
[1:01:55] think straight anymore and the world
[1:01:58] becomes such that is so depressed and
[1:02:00] they don't know which way to turn and
[1:02:02] they don't know what to do and you can
[1:02:04] talk to them about the Lord and
[1:02:06] seemingly there's just seem like there's
[1:02:08] a void part there and the part is true
[1:02:10] who hath heard our message there's is
[1:02:12] there anyone that would have faith to
[1:02:13] hear the message of the hour of today
[1:02:16] and and even though they they sometimes
[1:02:19] even will move to the spot where they
[1:02:21] can see that there's something there
[1:02:22] there's something that hindromes hinders
[1:02:24] them from actually accepting it I want
[1:02:27] to say this morning is that we have
[1:02:28] heard the message we've accepted the
[1:02:30] message we've received it and we put it
[1:02:33] into our heart and this message is
[1:02:35] changing us from glory to glory and and
[1:02:38] from from one level to another other
[1:02:40] level we're moving higher in the Lord
[1:02:42] continually in our walk with almighty
[1:02:44] God we can say that the Lord has been
[1:02:47] good to us amen that is true we're still
[1:02:50] in our human Veil and we get sick and we
[1:02:52] have disappointments and there's
[1:02:53] troubles within life but I'm so thankful
[1:02:56] that I have a place where I can bring my
[1:02:58] troubles to I'm thankful there's a place
[1:03:00] where I can bring him and lay him at the
[1:03:02] feet of the Lord Jesus and and he well
[1:03:05] he willingly takes them from me and and
[1:03:07] he gives us victory in in all of our
[1:03:10] battles there's not a battle that we
[1:03:12] have that the Lord is not part of the
[1:03:15] Lord is part of that battle sometimes he
[1:03:16] may allow things to come our way but he
[1:03:19] always leaves a way of Escape for us and
[1:03:21] a place where we can we can move into an
[1:03:24] element where we can have peace in our
[1:03:26] heart and joy in our soul and as brother
[1:03:29] Brown says sometimes we just need to put
[1:03:30] on our joy shoes on and be able to get
[1:03:33] happy in the Lord and happy with what
[1:03:35] God has done to us and be satisfied
[1:03:37] where what portion he has allotted to us
[1:03:40] in this life that we live today I say we
[1:03:43] have a lot of Liberty Liberty sometimes
[1:03:45] is is we want to get happy in the Lord
[1:03:48] and raise our hands but Liberty is
[1:03:51] actually not living as you would like to
[1:03:52] but it's living as God would have you to
[1:03:55] live that's really where true Liberty is
[1:03:57] true Liberty is something that I say
[1:04:00] Lord if I'm part of you and you're part
[1:04:03] of me then I've got Liberty to do
[1:04:05] whatever I want to do and there are just
[1:04:07] a lot of things I just don't care to do
[1:04:08] anymore I love going to the house of the
[1:04:11] Lord and some people say is that where
[1:04:13] you get an enjoyment from my ass and
[1:04:15] that's where I get my enjoyment from you
[1:04:17] may go and get intoxicated but I come
[1:04:19] here for the joy of the Lord would be my
[1:04:22] portion Amen to give us strength to walk
[1:04:25] the next day and give us strength to
[1:04:27] walk the next week and and galp Us in
[1:04:30] life's journey as we're moving along
[1:04:32] with the Lord I'm glad I don't have to
[1:04:34] look a long way off but I I can trust in
[1:04:37] the Lord that knows every day that's in
[1:04:39] front of me and he he knows every day
[1:04:41] that's in front of you because he has a
[1:04:43] care for you therefore he gives you a
[1:04:45] liberty
[1:04:46] he gives you freedom and the message on
[1:04:49] the Easter seal in 65 brother Brown says
[1:04:52] we were for ordained of God for this
[1:04:54] hour I thank God for that I say if
[1:04:57] there's ever an age that we could live
[1:04:58] and I I'm glad I don't live in the horse
[1:05:00] and buggy age I even though I like to
[1:05:02] look at a horse and the pastor but to go
[1:05:04] and
[1:05:05] saddle them up every day for
[1:05:07] transportation I'm glad I don't I'm
[1:05:09] living in this hour that we're living in
[1:05:11] I'm glad we have a light switch on the
[1:05:13] wall
[1:05:15] I'm glad we don't have to trim the trim
[1:05:17] the Wicks anymore and do all those
[1:05:19] things that's nice once in a while to
[1:05:20] create an atmosphere but I'm real happy
[1:05:22] when the atmosphere is over I say sister
[1:05:24] Meyer let's just flick the switch amen
[1:05:26] because I like I like the hour that we
[1:05:29] live in because this is the hour that
[1:05:31] has been promised that we shall not die
[1:05:34] but we shall be changed in the moment in
[1:05:36] the twinkling of an eye it's in this
[1:05:38] hour which is the greatest hour of all
[1:05:41] the ages to live is in this day that
[1:05:44] we're living today
[1:05:45] amen I'm glad I don't have to feed oats
[1:05:47] to something I'm glad to put gasoline
[1:05:49] into something you know what I'm saying
[1:05:51] amen I'm glad that we have jet planes to
[1:05:54] fly I'm glad we can do all those things
[1:05:56] amen we can move around quickly and
[1:05:59] God's ordained it at the end time that
[1:06:02] we could be here or your pastor could be
[1:06:04] come up to our place to minister amen
[1:06:07] and encourage the people in the Lord and
[1:06:09] one day those jet planes won't mean
[1:06:11] anything to us anymore because we're
[1:06:13] going to travel like a thought I say
[1:06:16] that we are privileged in this hour to
[1:06:18] live right in this day that we live in
[1:06:20] today
[1:06:21] Amen brother Brown said we are fordained
[1:06:24] of God for this hour the word of God
[1:06:26] manifests itself right through us and we
[1:06:29] live in the presence of God by the word
[1:06:32] promise of God there ain't a devil in
[1:06:35] hell can keep me from Raising and a door
[1:06:38] he could shut in my face at that morning
[1:06:40] the seals have been broken and brother
[1:06:42] Brown says hallelujah I'm free I'm an
[1:06:46] eagle can we say that this morning I'm
[1:06:49] free I'm an eagle
[1:06:51] let's say it was some passion this
[1:06:53] morning I'm praying I'm an eagle amen if
[1:06:57] we're an eagle then I'll be brother
[1:06:59] Brown says I'm no longer in a cage I'm
[1:07:02] happy to be out of that cage amen I'm
[1:07:05] happy I'm not the devil the devil's
[1:07:07] slave anymore I'm happy that I'm a slave
[1:07:10] unto Jesus Christ my Lord I'm happy that
[1:07:13] something has happened within our heart
[1:07:15] he says but I'm free I've raised from
[1:07:18] the dead into the new life of Jesus
[1:07:20] Christ not only me but every man woman
[1:07:23] boy or girl sitting here that's been
[1:07:26] filled with the into the spirit of God
[1:07:28] is a new creature in Christ and you are
[1:07:32] are an eagle I say that's exactly who we
[1:07:36] are now Eagle is a free burn
[1:07:39] he's not locked up on the ground I I
[1:07:41] appreciate the little birds that are
[1:07:43] that are in our trees and things and now
[1:07:45] they're starting to come back to where
[1:07:47] we are in Canada you guys are about four
[1:07:49] or five weeks ahead of us with your
[1:07:51] weather pattern we still got snow back
[1:07:53] home
[1:07:54] sister mom was telling me I hope it's
[1:07:55] melted by the time we get there but I
[1:07:57] said I don't know it's not going to be
[1:07:58] melted the weather's still real cool
[1:08:00] right now amen but but an eagle is a
[1:08:03] bird that can fly free
[1:08:05] remember the story brother Brown told
[1:08:07] about that eagle that was in that cage
[1:08:09] in that zoo and and how that that
[1:08:11] Eagle's head was all bloodied over and
[1:08:14] he just couldn't get out of that cage
[1:08:16] and brother Brown have said if he could
[1:08:18] have bought that eagle he would have
[1:08:19] bought it just to set it free and he
[1:08:22] kind of thought about men and women who
[1:08:24] are trapped in the devil's cage and how
[1:08:27] that they're beating their head to get
[1:08:29] out of that cage because they're not in
[1:08:31] Liberty if you serve the Devil he's not
[1:08:34] going to give you any Liberty he's not
[1:08:36] going to give you any freedom some
[1:08:38] people say when they leave the message I
[1:08:40] I got freedom back on my heart I said
[1:08:43] you got no freedom in your heart you
[1:08:45] become a prisoner to your condition you
[1:08:47] can become a prisoner in what you're
[1:08:49] doing there's no Freedom serving the
[1:08:52] devil there's only freedom in serving
[1:08:54] the lord Jesus Christ amen is there a
[1:08:57] witness in this house this morning
[1:08:58] there's only Freedom when you serve
[1:09:01] almighty God
[1:09:05] when he changed me would be when he
[1:09:08] changed us we became new creatures in
[1:09:09] Christ Jesus
[1:09:13] Liberty speaks of freedom
[1:09:16] excuse me
[1:09:18] were free from the burden of sin and
[1:09:20] shame
[1:09:22] does that make you still happy
[1:09:26] I find sometimes we we hear so much word
[1:09:29] sometimes a little Elementary Parts
[1:09:31] maybe don't really throw our heart
[1:09:32] anymore but it still throws my heart
[1:09:34] I'm free from the burden of sin and
[1:09:36] shame
[1:09:38] amen I'm freedom I have freedom from
[1:09:40] man-made religion
[1:09:42] I was one time a prisoner in man-made
[1:09:44] religion I'm so happy to be out of that
[1:09:47] somebody tried to put me in a pigeonhole
[1:09:49] no longer I said I ain't going into the
[1:09:51] pigeonhole I'm free and I've been born
[1:09:53] free and I'm not going back underneath

[1:10:02] journey and to move me right into the
[1:10:04] change of the body what more do we need
[1:10:07] we just need more faith in what we're
[1:10:08] reading amen we need to have a soul in
[1:10:11] our heart that one day when that
[1:10:13] anointing comes we will be changed amen
[1:10:15] I believe it's close at hand church amen

[1:10:20] of salvation
[1:10:22] what a glorious thing that is just bear
[1:10:24] with me for a while
[1:10:25] we receive the free gift of Salvation
[1:10:28] the the Bible tells us for by grace are
[1:10:30] you saved and and through faith and
[1:10:32] that's not of yourself it is a gift of
[1:10:34] God I'm happy to have this free gift of
[1:10:37] Salvation Amen in our town There's
[1:10:40] hundreds of people and thousands of
[1:10:42] people that don't experience this free
[1:10:43] gift but it came by our way and we
[1:10:46] received the free gift that God gave us
[1:10:48] and they're never the same anymore we're
[1:10:51] changing people look at it that we're
[1:10:53] restricted I say I'm not restricted I'm
[1:10:55] an eagle in this hour I fly in this hour
[1:10:58] I'm moving to the heavenlies amen When
[1:11:01] Faith Bank moves up I just move up with
[1:11:04] that Faith Bay amen because we're free
[1:11:06] we're Eagles in this hour
[1:11:10] we're no longer just underneath the man
[1:11:12] age or the ox age or the lion age but
[1:11:15] we're into the eagle age in this hour
[1:11:17] and if our egos the less fly like eagles
[1:11:19] less soar like eagles let our faith hold
[1:11:22] us up as an eagle
[1:11:25] let it come underneath our wings and
[1:11:27] move us
[1:11:29] at one time we were Bound in sin we were
[1:11:31] Bound by complexes we're bombed by I'm
[1:11:33] belief we're bombed by the power of the
[1:11:35] enemy but we heard the gospel trumpet
[1:11:38] and we were declared that we were free
[1:11:40] amen we know the story in the Old
[1:11:43] Testament when the 50th year would come
[1:11:46] around which was in the Year of Jubilee
[1:11:48] and the year Jubilee came around and
[1:11:50] that Trump had sounded they dropped
[1:11:52] their hole right where they were at and
[1:11:54] they were a free man they were they were
[1:11:56] in in prison they were slaves to their
[1:11:59] condition but when that trumpet sounded
[1:12:01] they became free man at that time amen I
[1:12:04] believe we're free men and women today
[1:12:06] amen I say that we're free to Worship in
[1:12:10] Liberty
[1:12:11] amen we're free to praise our God Amen
[1:12:14] if the spirit moves upon us then we
[1:12:17] allow God to take over and we're free to
[1:12:19] have the gifts of the church move within
[1:12:21] the church amen we're thankful for what
[1:12:24] God has done for us
[1:12:26] Amen in second Corinthians 3 17 it says
[1:12:28] now the Lord is a spirit and we're the
[1:12:31] spirit of the Lord is there is libertine
[1:12:34] in the in the Greek the word Liberty
[1:12:36] means to do or to Omit things having no
[1:12:39] relationship to Salvation
[1:12:43] Liberty to do or to Omit things having
[1:12:46] no relationship to Salvation the Liberty
[1:12:49] to do as one pleases
[1:12:51] true Liberty is living as we ought to
[1:12:54] not as we please
[1:12:56] amen that's where true Liberty is I'm
[1:12:59] thankful for the boundary of the word of
[1:13:00] God that keeps us in this hour
[1:13:03] amen I I'm like that guy that would be
[1:13:05] who if he was driving that stage coach
[1:13:07] one guy would say well I can ride right
[1:13:09] on the rim of the of the of the canyon
[1:13:12] and he was a real good horse rider or
[1:13:14] driving his care Chariot and the other
[1:13:16] person said I can ride it right over
[1:13:18] here the wheel's just kind of right on
[1:13:20] the edge and the other guy said I I'm
[1:13:22] not that good of a driver but I like to
[1:13:24] stay right close to the mountain amen
[1:13:26] that's a guy that I'm going to choose
[1:13:28] and I'm not going to try these other
[1:13:30] ones I want to be as close to the
[1:13:31] mountain I want to be a close to the
[1:13:33] word of God as I know how amen I want my
[1:13:36] life always to be matching what the
[1:13:38] Bible says about me amen I want to be a
[1:13:41] an image of what God had foresaw me to
[1:13:44] be and foresaw each one of us to be when
[1:13:47] we come to the other side amen we'll be
[1:13:49] exactly in the spot he would have us to
[1:13:51] be
[1:13:52] amen just once more Lord Brother Brown
[1:13:55] says you were saved 1900 years ago and
[1:13:58] now maybe today you'll accept that
[1:14:00] salvation but it's already paid for
[1:14:03] let's say paid for tonight or this
[1:14:05] morning it's paid for the debt has been
[1:14:08] cleared up the devil that put you in a
[1:14:11] pawn shop Jesus came and redeemed you
[1:14:13] and opened up the doors and the only
[1:14:15] thing you have to do is walk out
[1:14:18] let's say walk out this morning walk out
[1:14:21] and claim your Liberty that's all you
[1:14:24] have a receipt from God that is debt
[1:14:26] paid
[1:14:27] Glory Jesus said in his last words it is
[1:14:31] finished
[1:14:32] every Redemptive blessing was completely
[1:14:35] finished God's Great wrath on sin when
[1:14:38] when he became sin for us it was the
[1:14:41] debt was settled Satan has no more power
[1:14:45] amen do you believe that this morning
[1:14:48] amen I hope you had a good rest last
[1:14:50] night amen do you believe that this
[1:14:52] morning amen the dead has settled the
[1:14:55] dead is paid Satan has no more power
[1:14:59] amen only as he could Bluff with it if
[1:15:02] he could Bluff he went to all right
[1:15:03] you'll have to have it but legally he
[1:15:06] has no power at all
[1:15:09] I remember one time there was a guy that
[1:15:12] wanted to be a police officer but he
[1:15:13] wasn't no police officer
[1:15:15] he dressed himself up like a police
[1:15:17] officer bought him one of those little
[1:15:19] uh things that he put on the side there
[1:15:22] there was flick around bread and so
[1:15:24] forth he decided he was going to
[1:15:26] basically he did it too
[1:15:29] he turned he stopped people on the
[1:15:31] highway
[1:15:32] but also they realized he was no police
[1:15:34] officer
[1:15:36] and so he had no Authority in order to
[1:15:39] give him a ticket
[1:15:40] and so here we are brother Brown was
[1:15:42] saying that the devil legally has no
[1:15:45] power at all he could try to stop you
[1:15:47] but he can't stop you he may try to
[1:15:50] hinder you but he can't hinder you he
[1:15:53] may try to do a lot of things in your
[1:15:55] life but he can't do anything in his
[1:15:57] life because legally he has no power he
[1:16:00] has no Authority our Lord broke it on
[1:16:03] Calvary amen when he when he when he
[1:16:06] went to Calvary he has no power at all
[1:16:10] every Power he had was taken from him at
[1:16:13] Calvary that's where the price was paid
[1:16:15] he has nothing but a bluff
[1:16:20] if you want to listen to us Bluff well
[1:16:21] all right but you don't have to you are
[1:16:25] free tonight this morning he he has made
[1:16:28] you free and now is something in God's
[1:16:30] word can make you realize that you are
[1:16:32] free by his grace or something realized
[1:16:35] and the word makes you understand or
[1:16:36] some Act of God that it included you it
[1:16:40] accepts it includes us all then you just
[1:16:43] accept it on those bases and you're free
[1:16:45] also you don't have to feel different
[1:16:47] you don't have to feel anything at all
[1:16:49] Jesus never said did you feel it he said
[1:16:53] did you believe it amen who has heard
[1:16:56] our report did you believe it amen you
[1:16:58] believed it it's Faith that's our faith
[1:17:01] is an arm a mighty arm that holds a
[1:17:04] sharp two-edged sword of God and that
[1:17:06] sharp two-edged disorder will cut every
[1:17:09] let's say every every Promise free if
[1:17:12] the arm of faith is able to yield that
[1:17:14] sword some people have got some weak
[1:17:16] muscle trouble they maybe take a little
[1:17:18] scratch enough to join a church others
[1:17:20] can come into justification some can
[1:17:23] come all the way to the baptism of the
[1:17:25] Holy Ghost but a great strong arm
[1:17:27] holding this Bible can cut every Promise
[1:17:31] free that's right so be strong in the
[1:17:33] Lord I say this morning hour I believe
[1:17:36] that we believe that with all of our
[1:17:38] heart a strong arm of faith can cut
[1:17:40] every promise from the word of God
[1:17:44] uh we're alive in Jesus Christ send debt
[1:17:47] on Calvary has been paid
[1:17:49] Jesus sent back the Holy Ghost which is
[1:17:51] the comforter on the day of Pentecost
[1:17:54] which is the earnest of our inheritance
[1:17:57] we possess that now amen everything the
[1:18:00] church the Living God has need of we've
[1:18:03] received from God has been has been paid
[1:18:06] for there's nothing that's not paid for

[1:18:13] they had those big stamps and they would
[1:18:16] click click and when that click went
[1:18:18] down that meant it was paid for that
[1:18:20] mean that Bill had no more power or
[1:18:23] authority over me amen it was fully paid
[1:18:26] in full and Jesus Christ has paid
[1:18:29] everything we have need of if we need
[1:18:31] salvation it's paid for if we need
[1:18:34] healing it's paid for our transgressions
[1:18:37] are paid for our iniquities have been

[1:19:06] in full payment

[1:19:37] but he's washed at white as snow amen
[1:19:41] that's one of the old song but I love
[1:19:43] that old song because Jesus has paid it
[1:19:46] all
[1:19:47] everything's been paid for
[1:19:49] all we can do is we can point people to
[1:19:52] that and that's all I can do or anybody
[1:19:54] else can do is to point people of Jesus
[1:19:56] Christ who has already healed them who
[1:19:59] has already given us everything we have
[1:20:01] need of it's already in the atonement

[1:22:17] transgressions he was bruised for our
[1:22:19] iniquities

[1:22:32] overnight but that's not what the
[1:22:34] promise is
[1:22:35] the promises were healed
[1:22:37] it may take a long time it took took
[1:22:39] Abraham 25 years for the promise to come
[1:22:42] I look out as I look out at 25 years a
[1:22:45] long time but there came a time when the
[1:22:48] promise was fulfilled
[1:22:49] there came a time when Abraham woke up
[1:22:51] in the morning and he looked over and
[1:22:54] and the wife that he had married she was
[1:22:56] back to a young woman again there came a
[1:22:58] time when that happened and she looked
[1:23:00] over at Abraham and said something
[1:23:01] happened here you're a young you're a
[1:23:03] young man again you're young and
[1:23:05] handsome again
[1:23:08] you know my our old Pastor brother
[1:23:10] brother Gunther he's gone on to be with
[1:23:12] the Lord and he always told me there's
[1:23:14] two stages in life
[1:23:16] he said one of the stages in life is
[1:23:18] that you're good looking
[1:23:20] in the other stages you're looking good
[1:23:23] I kind of fall in this other looking
[1:23:25] good part is where I'm now people come
[1:23:27] up to me and said oh you're still
[1:23:28] looking good
[1:23:29] I say well that's kind of a compliment
[1:23:31] but I remember that all the time every
[1:23:32] time they say it I'm not good looking
[1:23:34] anymore I'm I'm just looking good now
[1:23:37] but there's coming a time when sister
[1:23:38] Mars going to say wow you're handsome

[1:23:43] time amen because we got a promise too

[1:24:58] couple the devil made but he never kept
[1:25:00] one of them and he's not going to keep
[1:25:02] one of them either he made lots of
[1:25:03] promises but he what can he keep he
[1:25:05] can't keep a promise he's a liar but God

[1:31:00] it means so much
[1:31:01] love and with all my heart and because
[1:31:04] of him when you who are not Jews heard
[1:31:07] the revelation of Truth you believed in
[1:31:10] the wonderful news of Salvation now we
[1:31:12] have been stamped with the Seal of the
[1:31:15] promised Holy Spirit I like that we've
[1:31:18] been stamped let's say stamp stamp with
[1:31:20] the Seal of the promised Holy Spirit in
[1:31:23] the ancient times the Kings and you
[1:31:25] would use what was called a Signet ring
[1:31:28] and that saying that ring was designed
[1:31:31] to bring was a was designated Authority
[1:31:34] and honor or ownership amen if the king
[1:31:38] had that on his hand it was a Signet
[1:31:40] ring when he stamped a document that
[1:31:43] document had all the power of the
[1:31:45] Kingdom behind it amen when you were
[1:31:47] stabbed by the holy spirit in your life
[1:31:49] all the power of the kingdom of God is
[1:31:52] behind you amen we are an ambassador in
[1:31:55] this hour but we're sealed with the
[1:31:57] promise of the Holy Ghost amen and all
[1:32:00] of Heaven is behind the Church of the
[1:32:02] Living God
[1:32:04] that segment would contain an emblem
[1:32:06] unique to the king it was not everybody
[1:32:09] had the same thing that you had one and
[1:32:11] you and the were yours was the same it
[1:32:13] was a saying that was was unique to that
[1:32:15] King our King has a unique Signet as
[1:32:18] well amen when it puts his when he puts
[1:32:20] it across your heart you'll never the
[1:32:22] chain same person anymore amen official
[1:32:26] documents were sealed with a a daploop
[1:32:28] of soft wax and he would impress it with
[1:32:31] the King saying that usually keeping on
[1:32:33] a ring on his finger such a seal
[1:32:35] certified the document as genuine much
[1:32:38] like an ordinary public stamp today and
[1:32:41] so that was important because it was a
[1:32:44] stamped Paul is using those analogies to
[1:32:46] to show to us that God has also stamped
[1:32:49] upon you the sign of ownership amen that
[1:32:53] he owns you you are part of him we
[1:32:55] become a love slave unto the Lord Jesus
[1:32:57] Christ amen and we and we therefore the
[1:33:01] fruits of almighty God I look at some
[1:33:04] people say they got the Holy Ghost said
[1:33:06] and there's mad as a hornet and and they
[1:33:08] shoot they just get everything upsets
[1:33:11] them all the time I say we just need
[1:33:13] more of the holy ghost in her life it
[1:33:15] came and to bring that that anger out of
[1:33:18] our life amen and replace it with the
[1:33:20] sweetness of almighty God
[1:33:23] Hallelujah
[1:33:26] that's the truth anyhow
[1:33:31] brother brownwell talks about that
[1:33:32] people who get so mad like shooting
[1:33:34] Buckshot on a
[1:33:36] on a piece of cowhide
[1:33:39] shouldn't be in the house of God
[1:33:41] I don't know why I'm saying that but I
[1:33:43] just said it
[1:33:44] verse 14 in in the in the passion
[1:33:47] translation he has given to us like an
[1:33:49] engagement ring is given to a bride as
[1:33:53] the first installment of what's coming
[1:33:55] amen he is our whole promise of a future
[1:33:58] inheritance which seals us onto until we
[1:34:00] have all the Redemptive blessings and
[1:34:02] experiences complete Freedom all for the
[1:34:05] Supreme Glory
[1:34:06] and honor of God
[1:34:09] when I met
[1:34:10] well sister admire myself we grew up in
[1:34:12] church
[1:34:14] and so she sat on one aisle and I sat in
[1:34:16] the center I sat on the other aisle
[1:34:18] the deacons were always watching making
[1:34:20] sure we were making eyes at one another
[1:34:23] that Hall of soap too if we did too
[1:34:25] say okay there's no making eyes in
[1:34:27] church no passing notes nowadays they
[1:34:30] just send text messages
[1:34:32] kind of sneak around it that way
[1:34:35] I remember the moment when I moment I'm
[1:34:38] talking about an engagement ring
[1:34:40] he's given us engagement ring like you
[1:34:42] give to a bride the first installment
[1:34:44] I remember when I when I asked sister
[1:34:46] Mar if she would marry me
[1:34:48] we were just kids but but it was we
[1:34:52] still have that plaque up I'd marry you
[1:34:53] again I'd never change the thing about
[1:34:55] him I never would I was only 18 she was
[1:34:58] 16. we were just kids growing up
[1:35:00] together
[1:35:01] no don't tell your parents that brother
[1:35:04] Kelly Sister Mary got married when they
[1:35:06] were kids but we were kids
[1:35:08] and and I remember when I asked her if
[1:35:10] she would marry me I gave her an
[1:35:11] engagement ring as a token of my love to
[1:35:13] her and my she received that and my
[1:35:16] heart was fluttering her heart was
[1:35:17] fluttering but you know the thing that I
[1:35:19] noticed that I observed I really
[1:35:21] observed this is that she she never
[1:35:24] tried to hide it
[1:35:25] see people try to hide their
[1:35:26] Christianity on Monday if it's really in
[1:35:29] your heart you can't hide it because
[1:35:31] there's something in your heart that
[1:35:32] wants to display it no she had that ring
[1:35:35] out where everybody could see it you
[1:35:36] ever see it done they kind of have it up
[1:35:38] this big rock right over here there's
[1:35:40] one hey did you guys get engaged oh yeah
[1:35:42] do you want to see it and they're so but

[1:35:59] it off she'd polish that thing up still
[1:36:01] does it after 40 42 years I guess we're
[1:36:04] married now she's still polishes that
[1:36:05] thing up all the time makes sense it
[1:36:07] does not look nice still part of
[1:36:09] sparkles just like the day he gave it to
[1:36:10] me must have meant a lot to her on that
[1:36:12] day I gave it to her amen but you know
[1:36:15] she doesn't try to hide it amen why do

[1:36:24] predestinated unmerited favor on your

[1:41:33] the bride ourselves in plain view
[1:41:35] amen and if we see him in plain view

[1:41:43] level we we are him instead because he's
[1:41:46] he's shining on our lives but we're the

[1:42:21] amen where were they free favor free
[1:42:24] from denominationalism they were free

[1:42:52] there was a I was thinking about this in
[1:42:55] the covet time and and I have I was in
[1:42:58] under quarantine for for for not very
[1:43:00] long fortunately but it was just for a
[1:43:03] few days and and I remember when they
[1:43:05] called me and they said they said uh
[1:43:08] talk to me one more time and they wanted
[1:43:09] to know okay when did this happen or did
[1:43:11] that happen you all had it here the same
[1:43:12] way with the same protocol and and so I
[1:43:15] was only in quarantine on Friday and
[1:43:17] this was Sunday
[1:43:18] and someday
[1:43:20] um they called and all of a sudden
[1:43:22] Sunday she said you're free
[1:43:24] and she went through the whole thing and
[1:43:25] the date and all this and she said
[1:43:27] you're free well I've only been in
[1:43:28] quarantined for two days and I was real
[1:43:30] happy to be free
[1:43:32] I'll tell you what when I looked at my
[1:43:33] yard and I looked at I can't go past
[1:43:35] that boundary I felt like a prisoner I
[1:43:38] didn't know what to do with myself
[1:43:40] I thought I told sister Mara I said this
[1:43:42] isn't good they're going to watch us and
[1:43:43] they called us and make sure we're
[1:43:45] behaving ourselves at home I never seen
[1:43:47] anything like that
[1:43:49] and so I was free and she wasn't she
[1:43:52] wasn't very happy because she didn't get
[1:43:53] free with the same day I got free it was
[1:43:55] two weeks later when she got free and
[1:43:58] and she really let those Health people
[1:44:00] know it too but anyhow but I got free
[1:44:03] and I was happy to be free
[1:44:05] amen the first thing I asked that nurse
[1:44:07] when she called me I asked her and
[1:44:09] excuse me for my carnality for a moment
[1:44:10] ask can I go wash my truck she said you
[1:44:13] can go do whatever you want to do you're
[1:44:15] free I felt so good to be free not
[1:44:18] realizing at that time that brother Abe
[1:44:20] we was in the ICU unit and they wanted
[1:44:23] somebody to come pray for him and the
[1:44:25] day they called me is the day they Set
[1:44:27] Me Free and the very next day I went to
[1:44:29] pray for him and I see you you I said
[1:44:32] our God does great thing I said brother
[1:44:34] Abe god Set Me Free and God's gonna set
[1:44:36] you free from this bed of Affliction
[1:44:38] that you're in right now I said get
[1:44:40] ready for it amen God's gonna bring you
[1:44:43] out of this place amen because he
[1:44:45] promised his word amen we're Freeborn
[1:44:48] citizens
[1:44:50] Hallelujah
[1:44:52] God does things well he does things on
[1:44:55] time every time amen one look like a
[1:44:58] disaster turned out for the glory of
[1:45:01] almighty God
[1:45:03] Hallelujah
[1:45:05] brother Abe came out of that hospital
[1:45:07] room just a couple of days later and and
[1:45:09] he's doing well he just come home from
[1:45:11] Louisiana
[1:45:12] a couple days we're turning around and
[1:45:14] coming right back to you all but he's so
[1:45:17] he was so happy I was so happy I thought
[1:45:19] Lord what does it feel like to have
[1:45:21] Liberty to have freedom hey man I
[1:45:24] couldn't imagine being bound up in a
[1:45:26] jail cell amen I'm thankful for Freedom
[1:45:28] that we've gone
[1:45:31] the truth shall make you free you shall
[1:45:34] know the truth and the truth shall make
[1:45:35] you free which was the words of Jesus
[1:45:37] and if the son therefore shall make you
[1:45:39] free you shall be free indeed and that
[1:45:42] word in the Greek means set a Liberty
[1:45:45] from the Dominion of sin
[1:45:48] of Liberty from the Dominion of sin so
[1:45:51] we're no longer captive to the Dominion
[1:45:53] of sin we've just changed kingdoms
[1:45:57] I don't know if it's in your news but we
[1:45:59] have it in our news back home about
[1:46:00] about the Royal Family
[1:46:03] and and about about one of the sons that
[1:46:05] he feels left out and so forth and no
[1:46:07] doubt it's it's in your country
[1:46:10] I think he's got a book written or
[1:46:12] whatever more but I was thinking about
[1:46:13] that for a while
[1:46:15] and I thought if they are our King's son
[1:46:18] or a queen son
[1:46:20] then there are certain ways they're
[1:46:21] taught in order to be a king son and to
[1:46:25] be a queen son there are certain
[1:46:27] protocols they have to go through they
[1:46:29] have to know how to conduct themselves
[1:46:30] in public they've got to know how to eat
[1:46:32] when they get it to the table they've
[1:46:34] got to know how to stand and they have
[1:46:36] to know how to wave just right if to me
[1:46:38] and you it looks ridiculous but church
[1:46:40] we are also King sons amen and King King
[1:46:43] sons amen we're being trained a certain
[1:46:46] way ain't it because we're set free from
[1:46:49] the Dominion of sin and we're in the
[1:46:51] Kingdom of almighty God
[1:46:54] and God is training us
[1:46:56] to rule and reign with him
[1:46:59] that's why all we take with us is our
[1:47:01] character and that character is going to
[1:47:04] be tried in the fiery flame of
[1:47:05] Affliction to see what's inside of our
[1:47:08] own heart amen I say Lord if you want to
[1:47:11] turn up the heat then turn it up because
[1:47:13] I don't want anything in my life that
[1:47:15] will hinder me from that day
[1:47:17] [Applause]
[1:47:19] we're King sons and daughters of the
[1:47:21] Living God Amen we're being groomed to
[1:47:24] be a king to be able to sit on the
[1:47:26] throne with Christ
[1:47:30] not just any person but chosen people
[1:47:34] chosen people that were in the thoughts
[1:47:37] of God from before the foundation of the
[1:47:38] world Amen

[1:48:08] Justified and whom he justified them he
[1:48:11] also glorified amen what shall we say to
[1:48:14] these things of God before us who can be
[1:48:16] against us amen I say this morning hour
[1:48:19] of gods for you who can be against you

[1:48:59] conquerors through him that loved us for

[1:49:13] nor death death nor any creature shall
[1:49:16] be able to separate us from the love of
