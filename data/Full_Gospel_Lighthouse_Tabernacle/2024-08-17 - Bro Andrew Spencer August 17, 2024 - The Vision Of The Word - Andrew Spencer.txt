need reminding how I've been set free there is a cross that bears the burden where another died for me there is another in the fire all my dead left for dead beneath the water I'm no longer a slave to my sin [Applause] anymore and should I fall in the space between what remains of me and this Reckoning either way I bow to the things of this world and I know I will never be alone there is another in the fire standing next to me there is another in the water holding back the Seas could I ever need [Music] reminding what power set me breing there is a grave that holds nobody now the power lives in me there is another in the fire there is another in the fire [Music] and I can see the light in the darkness as the darkness bows to him I can hear the RO in the heavens as a space between where I can feel the ground shake beneath us as the prison w cave nothing stands between us nothing stands between us there is no other name but the name that is Jesus he who was and still is and will be through it [Music] all so come with May in the space between all the things unseen and this Reckoning and I know I will never be alone to be another in the fire standing next to me be another in the water

so we just we just want to welcome them but we want to welcome our Lord Jesus Christ here tonight we want him to feel welcome we invited him he's here we feel the effects of the Holy Spirit even so now it's amazing that the Holy Spirit can affect the emotions of both our soul our spirit and our flesh you feel the vibrations of the Holy Spirit on your flesh even now but how greater is it that we can recognize the power and the effect of the Holy Spirit on our soul that what's that's what makes the difference between a unbeliever and a real believer is the genuiness the Seed Life of Christ being affected by the word and by the presence we just want to ask the author of the word just now to come and take the word and speak to us I know that many of us here have needs and we've got things on our heart that we want to see the Lord meet we've got meetings that are coming up in two weeks and we just want to be remember and our our brother puit and brother Timothy and brother Tim and our brother Donnie Reagan that God would lay on their heart exactly what we would have need of and we're in a very special season and we just want to align oursel with the word so let's just join together as a body of Believers just now and invite the Lord Jesus just to come by our way Heavenly Father Lord our hearts are bubbling Lord with the presence with the goodness of God lord to see the effects of the Holy Spirit how it has how it is mingled in our emot tions it has affected us Lord to see that you are the God of all the Earth Lord and we have prayed it over and over again thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven father we realize Lord Jesus that you're taking these Earthly Tabernacles and you're matching them up to Heavenly Heavenly things we realize Lord Jesus that you came to redeem Not Angels you did didn't come to redeem stars but you come to redeem sons of God human beings vessels where the Holy Spirit could come and live in and we just want to take our vessel just now and put it in line with your word father Lord we pray God that our bodies would be in line with your word Lord that you could let healing rain in our Natural Body we pray that our spirit would be in line with your word that you could run through our reasoning and our infections and our emotions and and our conscience and all of it and line it up with the word and may our soul oh God Lord let it burn father with the power of the Holy Spirit we could say our soul has been caught on fire lord with the word of the hour I pray God that you would do the miraculous here amongst us tonight Lord I I have felt I have felt the hand of the Lord tonight upon this thought and I pray that you would just help me just set myself aside as it were you could use my body and you could use my lips and you could use my voice Lord to be to be an instrument for the Holy Spirit to speak through now God we lay aside every weight and every sin just now and ask that the Holy Spirit would bless us abundantly as we run this race with all that it's within us so father we glorify your name and may you reign in this atmosphere tonight in Jesus name name we pray these things amen and amen and amen God richly bless you tonight if you have your Bibles we would like to look over in the book of Ephesians the book of Ephesians chapter 1 and verse 9 and also to 2 Corinthians chapter 5 and verse 7 Ephesians chapter 1 and verse 9 having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated let's say that together being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsil of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ in whom ye also trusted after that ye heard the word of Truth the go Gospel of your salvation in whom also after that ye believed you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of Promise notice the notice the the literature and how it's lined out here how Paul writes this in whom also after you believed you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of Promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory also so 2 Corinthians chap 5 and: 7 just one verse here we'd like to draw a text from this evening Paul says it like this for we walk by faith not by sight may God bless his word you may be seated in the presence of the Lord for we walk by faith and not by sight tonight I'd like to speak to you on a thought that the Lord laid on my heart this past Wednesday evening on the vision the vision of the word the vision of the word and we realize that we are living we are living in an age we're living in an age of progression and we are living in an age of where we are seeing all the benefits of the tree of knowledge of good and evil as it's as you're seeing all of the wisdom of the leaves off of that tree how that it is becoming made manifest you've seen the Tree of Life you've watched the power of the tree of life and you've watched Jesus Christ work work through the gifts of the body you've seen Jesus Christ but now we are living in an age where we're literally watching the tree of wisdom and knowledge as men begin to eat off of that tree they begin to gather they begin to gather fruits off of that tree and you begin to watch men in the science realm and they begin to eat more and more and we realize that the more Humanity eats off of it the more that we destroy ourself but we realize that through scientific Ingenuity that men have developed uh the ability to be able to to look beyond the elements that you and I see with our natural eyes and they they have developed systems to be able to look beyond the Earth's surface below below the Earth and they have developed things and telescopes and and Hubble Hubble Scopes to be able to look into the world above by using different lenses and different sensors to be able to look into by radar and look into the ground below and and different forms of vision to be able to look past what we see in on the surface of an object and you can see how advanced how that we've came for the past 100 years we have become the most modernized and the most advanced in that in that in that realm to be able to say that that we have tapped into a world that that necessarily we don't fully understand in our Humanity but yet men have ate off of that tree of knowledge and they have they have gained access under those things even even uh we realize that even uh uh the The Brainiac Albert Einstein he tapped into a world and brother bandam would use the terminology that he tapped into God's laboratory and the we see that men have the ability to be able to to look into a world that maybe we can't see with our own eyes and it's amazing that that even in our human sight we are limited in our human sight so that we can't see we can't see through that wall we can't see through this that or the other but we realize that man has developed technology so they can use sensors and they can use radar they can they can Pierce through and they can look and see heat elements and they can see different worlds and they can use x-ray machines but we realize that man in all of its power and man in all of its scientific Ingenuity that it's limited in that aspect you even we realize that God has got a a vision that looks past what we can see he has the ability to see the the Eye of of the Lord is upon them that fear Him and we real that God has seen us before the foundation of the world that that even though that man has has different Technologies of ex-ray machines that he uses he uses the light of the body to be able to look in there and see whether you have a broken bone or whether you have this that or the other but man using that x-ray machine they still cannot see cannot see and pick up unseen forces that are setting there brother Brandon would use it in a time when he said if you would see somebody that would be death and dumb he he said they could look there by an x-ray machine and they could look there and maybe see all of the elements of the body he said but they can't see that unseen Force the devil sitting there that is cutting off the the hearing to the ear and cutting off the ability to be able to speak he said but what it is he said it's an unseen Force he said it's a devil that is sitting there you see Satan can hide from man but Satan cannot hide from almighty God is that right Satan can hide from man Satan can hide from the instruments of humanity but he cannot hide from almighty God I remember when when brother Ron was going through the the process of testing out biopsies and going through and chest texting out testing different aspects of of his length nodes and different things they were looking for it and it would try to hide it would try to move cancer is a living cell that that's got a got it's got connected a Bru cell that's connected to a live cell and it started to move and it's tried to hide but before long the doctors were able to find it but before them doctors were able to find that little bitty scarf tissue go almighty God had already recognized and was working on the scene before man could find it now Jesus would say this in Luke chap 10 and 23 that he turned unto them unto his di his disciples and said privately blessed are the eyes blessed are th eyes which see the things that you see for I tell you that many prophets and Kings have desired to see those things which you see and have not seen them and to hear those things which you hear and have not heard them so we realize that God hasn't ordained elect lady or elect people to be able to see what God wills and what God wants in his word he he has elected people in every age in the age of Noah in the n in the age of Moses he elected men and ordained men to fall under the leadership of the word of that hour now brother Brandon would say this that a vision is God by a word of knowledge it's dropping to a person to foresee or foresee something he says it tells something that has been or something that will be a vision is the forecast of future events it foretells things before it happens it it's a vision for tell something before it ever happens it's it's like a it's like you and I maybe we have we we all dream in an element of of our subconscious and we dream there but a vision is while a person is awake and they literally are watching the scene before it takes place brother bom would say in a prophetic real that a vision is thus sayith the Lord and it's saying that these things are going to be thus and thus and we realize that the word of the Lord that the voice of the word of the hour is everything that we have need of is that right the voice of the word will meet the need of the hour that we're in and I say it like this we don't need an intellectual speech to meet the need of the hour we don't we don't need some work up by emotions to meet the need of the hour but what we want and what we desire as Christians is the vision of God to be able to speak in this hour because I believe that that God has certain words in certain times and certain season that he begins to drop words and drop things that are released as prophecy for the season that humanity is setting in just like it is said in Isaiah chapter 40 and3 that it was the voice of one crying in the wilderness but it took 7 12 12 years later that there John the Baptist was standing there and he was fulfilling the vision of Isaiah and here John the Baptist he looked like Elijah he dressed like Elijah he ate like Elijah his ministry had the ability to attract crowds like a like Elijah what was it he was falling in line with what the scriptures would say that there would become a third coming of Elijah in that day and that is the power of Prophecy in every Ag and and every time that a prophet would arise and when prophecy would come the ability of power of Prophecy it literally draws people it literally contracts or attracts the believer to the word of the hour it's like the bait on the end of a hook it attracts the fish you don't show him the hook you show him the bait is that right and so here is the pull of the hour and it begins to attract the elected ones of the hour to come to that season to the manifestation that God ordained them to be at it's amazing when you begin to look at it that you have been pulled up you have been pulled up to be able to see what you see if you can look at it like this Abraham do you really see who you are Abraham do you really see who you are in the Great scheme of things you're not just another man going through the tions you're not just another man living in a far country but you are here living out prophecy and I believe that if Abraham could take a step back and look at what God had ordained for him in his life he could fully capture the vision of what God had had in store for him I believe that too many times that we we as Christians we look on the surface of things and we don't take a step back and look at what the great scheme of things that is going on amongst the word of the hour if can look at it like this Moses do you see who you are do you see who you are you're not just a son of Joseph and amram but you are raised come on somebody to just not just to be the a man that was floating down the down the Nile River but you are raised for a purpose if I could say it like this little bride do you see who you are can you see yourself in the word in the scope of the word not just by looking at your own natural eye not just looking at it from your own Humanity but looking at it through God's elected word in modern events the prophet would say not one time has it ever missed he said it won't for who for who are predestinated to see it will see it Jesus said no man can come to me except my father draws him and all that the father has given me will come it's the word joining with the word it can't do nothing else now notice what the Bible said in Romans 9:11 for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to the election might stand not of works but of him that calleth now go down to verse 21 and the Bible said hath not the powder power over the clay or the same lump to make one vessel under honor and another under dishonor it's the power of the Potter that makes the vessel is that right you didn't put yourself in line for this but there is somebody that has made a vessel under Hunter and somebody that has made a vessel under dishonor what if God willing to show his wrath and to make his power known endured with much long with much longsuffering the vessels of Wrath fitted to destruction and that he might make known The Riches of his glory on the vessels of Mercy which he had a four prepared unto glory to think about the for knowledge of almighty God that he appointed he has an appointed time to release the forecast to release the forecast of the hour that we're living in that God has ordained vessels of Honor right here in the midst of Le oosa when there's many vessels of Dishonor when there's many of wicked of Wrath and vessels of Destruction but God has ordained somebody that would be a vessel of Honor that would aligns by the preaching of the word again he would say now I want you to notice he does it that way in every age he does it every time by the same method he has to take Believers then in order to have Believers to meet that word he's got to predestinate it to that age you see he's got to predestinate this thing to be there to meet the challenge of the age so God did not just send you here just to see if it would work or not the prophet would say that he predestinated a people that's going to receive the word of the hour so he did not send you here in vain he didn't send you through the trials that you've been through just in vain he didn't send you through the calamities of life just for you to go through them and not for them to work for your good but he sent you through it for a reason for a purpose you had a week like you had just to just to prove that God was that kind of a God that he could bring you out so that he could bring you in now we know what the Bible said in Proverbs 29 and 18 is very familiar to us that where there is no vision the people perish where there is no vision the people perish so we realize that by this word right here that the word of God is Not Just to be read or heard it's to be seen the word of God is not just for the hearing of the ears but the word of God is for you to see it we've heard about what God had did in Moses we heard what God did in Noah we heard what God did in David we heard what God did in Isaiah we heard what God did in Elijah but I don't want to just hear about the God of Elijah I don't want to just hear about the God of Moses I don't want to just hear about the God of David I want to see that God come on somebody if we're just serving a dead Fable then we're no greater than any other religion but if we have a living God that has a vision for the generation so I believe that according to the scripture that the god that we serve has a vision for the hour that we're living in because I look out upon this age I don't see a perishing people you might see that in leosia you might see that in the church world but I do not see that in the Church of the Bride of Jesus Christ this bride is not perishing this bride is not in famine this bride is not falling away way this bride is moving higher Satan has done his absolute worst to stop the Bride of Jesus Christ but she has a vision she has a hope she has a glory so when we align oursel with the vision of the word we see the cosmos through God's eyes when we align oursel with the word we can see through God's eyes what are you saying brother Andrew I'm saying it like this we see the Brokenness but we also see the potential for healing we see the sin but we also see the power of redemption we see disappointments but we see opportunities we see people that are bound but we see an opportunity for deliverance we see the blind but we see an opportunity to Open the blind's Eyes so the word of the hour literally enables us to discern from right and wrong Cory timbon that came out of the Nazi camp said it like this said if you look at the world you'll be distressed if you look within you'll be depressed but if you look at God you'll be at rest now here's a woman that was helping Jews get into their house and get out of the hands of Nazis they caught her put her in concentration camps put her in there and she made her way through it by the hand of the Lord Jesus Christ and she said if you look out there if you look out there you'll be depressed if you look in here if you look in here you'll be distressed but if you look at God I want to ask you where's your eyes at tonight where's your vision at tonight if all you see is Hope of falling away if all you see is healing not coming if all you see is distress that's constantly binding you then you've got your eyes on the wrong things but if you've got your eyes on the word if you've got your eyes oh Hallelujah so let me let me just put it in view so if we the seen the seen can catch the Unseen then we'll see the supernatural if we the seen in our mortal bodies can cut can catch the Unseen then we'll catch the inspiration of almighty God now notice what the prophet would say like this in looking at the Unseen he said when a man once catches that vision of the Invincible God and knows that he's always present he said there's something that stabilizes that man's thinking he said it stabilizes his action in the time of distress and in trouble it'll make him look upward above the things that are happening around him because he's looking at the Unseen by a promise you see the man when he can ever capture that vision of the Unseen it literally stabilizes his thinking when you look at the prophet mcka when he's standing there and ahab's getting ready down there to go down into battle brother Joel he's going down there and he's looking out there and a Jehoshaphat hears the voice of 400 prophets and they say we're going to go out there and we're going to conquer it but Jehoshaphat being a righteous man he said is there what yet one more prophet in the land and Ahab said there's one he said but I hate him he hates me he said every time I try to do something he curses me he stops me right in my right in my steps but Jehoshaphat called for Micaiah and they come down there Micaiah come all the way down there and said now look they had a conference with him and said you only say what we've said Micaiah said I'm not going to say what you said but I'm only going to say what the word of the Lord puts up my lips so Micaiah goes up there he goes up there and grabs a vision from almighty God he said I'm going to wait and compare my vision with the word of the hour because he realized that Elijah had already cursed Ahab so Micaiah knew that he couldn't have a vision out line out of line with what Elijah had already said so Micaiah had to have a vision that matched the word of the hour so Mao when he was standing there in the face of criticism in the face of false prophets when the face of them slapping him in the face he stood there like a true prophet and the prophet said that he compared his vision with the word and he knew that he was right in line so let me ask you this what is your vision compared to the message of the hour if it says you can have three wives and three husbands it's not in line with the word let me preach just for a minute if it says you can dll yourself up and look like Hollywood then your vision is not in line with the word come on somebody if your vision tells you that you've got every right to go and smoke and drink and do all those things then your vision is not lined up with the word but Micaiah stood right there literally he caught the Unseen and it stabilized his thinking that in the face of all of the criticism he was fortified by the vision of the word you look at this bride this bride ain't wavering she's not staggering back and forth under the pressures of Le osia but she's steadfast she's unmovable she's enduring she's pressing the battle she's not moving when people say the message is wrong she's not moving when Satan comes against her but she stands right there she's stabilized she's got a vision she's got a vision of the Unseen World let me tell you your testimony you being here testifies that there is is an Unseen World I love what the prophet said and why can I speak he said Faith sees what God wants he said Faith looks to see what God wants and it works accordingly faith is a long range Vision he said that don't lower its sights it holds to the Target and any shooter knows that he said it's a long range Vision he said it's a telescope it's a binocular you don't look around here you don't use binoculars to see what time it is come on somebody you don't use binoculars to look at your watch do you you useing binoculars look way out there he said you don't use binoculars look see what time it is you don't use that but you use binoculars to look way off he said and that's what faith does faith picks up God's binoculars both of them both sides of New and Old Testament and sees every promise that he made and Faith sees it out yonder and Faith chooses that Faith chooses that regardless of the present tense says here he looks at that end now I know good and well who I'm talking to tonight you're not looking at the things that you see because if you were looking at the things that you see you would have done gave up this week so you're looking at it Faith you're looking at it through the eyes of faith and faith is taking you into a world that you don't necessarily understand with your natural eyes but you have abilities by faith to put yourself in line with the power I'm going somewhere y'all just buckle up I'm going somewhere because when Jesus was standing here he was not like any other man but he was endued with the power to be able to look at the Unseen because the rest of men was standing out there at a whale and they saw a prostitute but Jesus wasn't looking at what men see now I know somebody's got the ability to say Amen to that because there was somewhere in your life that Humanity could not see what God was seeing in you what what did Jesus see the word saw the word on the inside of that prostitute he looked at her and and he called her by the word it's just like it's just like when he was looking at Simon and he looked at there he said blessed off thou Simon for Flesh and Blood did not reveal this unto you he changed his name from Simon to Peter now everybody would have said Peter's a wrong guy to choose he was the kind of guy shot from the hip he was everywhere he just acted in the moment but Jesus saw something he saw something that Andrew his brother didn't see he saw something that John didn't see he saw something that Bartholomew didn't see what did he see he saw somebody that would be a rock of testimony I think about brother Jim Noel I think about how God would Raise A Man up that should have never been here that should have never been in the picture but the word saw the word there was a line of things that should have kept Jim Noel out but the word saw the word hallelujah all of you should have never been here but the word saw the word Jesus was not looking at your flesh Jesus was not looking at your mistakes Jesus was looking at himself Romans 8:24 says for we are saved by hope but hope that is seen is not hope for what a man seeth why does he yet hope for but if we hope for that we see not then do we have patience to wait for it so the scripture is saying that you have an expectation of the future good I love what the Bible said in Psalms 40 and 12 for innumerable evils have compassed me about my iniquities have taken a hold upon me so that I'm not able to look up you look at that word in the Hebrew when the psalmist writes this that he says my iniquities have taken a hold upon me so that I'm able not to look up but you look at that in the Hebrew it means that I'm not able to see so the the the mistakes the iniquities had made the worshipper into a spot that he couldn't even see man ain't that powerful they are more than the hairs of my head therefore my heart faileth me so the guilt of life's mistakes had caused a man to look at himself and not have the ability to see how many angels we got in the building uhuh got you over there buddy it's a it's more in here than you can see but it's a whole lot of humans that you can see and at some point in our life we had we had we had mistakes on us we had Tri s on us we had things upon us that we couldn't see what God sees when you look at the scripture and you perfectly line them words up of being able not to see it's perfectly in line with what Jesus was setting forth to his disciples in the fa in the parable of Luke chapter 18 of the worshipper that had came to the house of God of the Publican and the Pharisee and he's standing there in Luke 18 and the Pharisees standing there it said Lord I thank you I'm not like an adulator I'm not like an extortionist I'm not unjust and I'm not like this so far this so-called Publican right here I fast twice a week I pray every day I go to the house of the Lord and the Publican stood right there and the Bible said that he that he had so much on him that he couldn't even look up to heaven but I love what the scripture said that he smoted his chest and and said God be merciful to me a sinner and Jesus said that this man went to his house Justified ain't it amazing that Satan wants to keep your focus on the things of this life and the mistakes of this life but Jesus Takes your ability to look at the things that you see and translate them to the things that he wants you to see let me let me just paint a picture to you just for a minute when I gave my heart to the Lord that was one thing and I didn't realize what I was fully running from but for about 18 to 24 months I was running with everything that was on the inside of me running from this calling I was running with a power that was human power because the things that were on me the things that I had done I had done it in the face of the public I had I had you you watched me grow up here you watch me as a Christian boy raised in a Christian Home raised in a place raised in a place that that that that I that I that that I thought that I knew what was right but yet there was no power there was no power because I did not have the life of it I didn't have the life of it to live on the inside of me and I allowed them mistakes to hold me back from running because Satan ens snared me what if this one remembers what if that one remember they watch you grow up they watch you do this ain't it amazing now I'm painting my picture but I know I'm painting your picture too is that Satan loves loves to put you and make you focus on the things that you've done and he doesn't want you to put your focus on the things that the cross did but I was in my room one night and I was running with everything that's within me and I said God if you called me to this I'll run with everything that's within me but I will not come out of this room until you call me I was that desperate with God I locked myself in that room and I wasn't coming out and all of a sudden the spirit of the Lord spoke to me and said turn to Isaiah 30 and 21 and the word of the Lord said thine ears will hear a voice behind thee saying this is the way walk ye in it when you turn to the left and when you turn to the right I walked out and said I'm called to preach I knew what I was was running from but when the word of the Lord put me in line with his vision I may have had mistakes I may have had failures I may have had problems but I was called by almighty God and though Satan May tried to ensnare me though Satan may have tried to corrupt me the power of God was far greater than the depths of Satan could ever ens snare me too I love how how Jesus goes down in Luke chapter 18 he goes down in there and he's walking by Jericho and he finds a man Jesus is passing by and it looks like he ain't going to stop but blind barus is sitting there he's sitting there he's hanging on to every word and all of a sudden he hears a commotion down there at Full Gospel Lighthouse I said what is that what's going on up there they said it's Jesus it's Jesus and when he cried out the more even though people tried to stop him from saying amen even though people tried to stop him and Reign him in with his words he cried out the more and said thou son of David have mercy don't have judgment on me have mercy on me what did he ask for he said What wilt thou have me do that I might receive my vision now notice his vision was stolen from him and you think about the things that Satan has tried to do in this hour he has tried to rob the Church of the Living God from her vision to stop her to keep her in a place that she can't live any higher but God has God has elected a vision for the hour and when when he looked when blind Bemus sitting there in his blindness and when Jesus said these words receive thy sight thy faith ha made thee whole come on somebody thy faith have made thee whole I love it I love it because even though there was critics there that was trying he was stabilized by capturing the Unseen you say well that person shouldn't shout in church that person shouldn't Amen in church that person shouldn't clap their hands in church come on somebody Jesus had done been by this man Jesus had done walk by him he done went on but because of his shouting because of his need behind his shout it perfectly aligned himself for his healing maybe you don't understand maybe you don't understand but I want to say this to you God's got a vision for you and the vision is a vision that'll line up to the word I notice I was talking to brother Andrew Glover and he this evening he said to send you all his greetings I was I was conversing with him on some of these texts and he sent me this quote brother maram said and looking for Jesus he said now what is a vision he said it's another dimension he said it's a six sense brother Bon captures that in 1964 and question answers he said you see there a door you see there you see you're a dual person three people in soul body and spirit he said I believe you're outward senses he said your soul your body he said your outside conscience your senses he said when when you're awake in other words he said you're operated by five senses see taste feel smell and hear them were only given to you to contact your Earthly home he said they were not given to you to contact your heavenly home he said that's there's actually six senses in the human body because he's number six in the Bible he was created on the sixth day he's a number six man he is he's got a see see taste feel smell and hear and Faith now notice this his faith sets his destination for where he's headed for I love what the prophet says his faith sets his destination for where he's H it for faith is not an emotion faith is not a feeling faith is a revelation come on somebody faith is not when you're worked up Faith is not when you're shouting faith is a revelation that be brings about an emotional shout a dance but Faith sets a destination I love what the prophet would say now out in front of you is a well body out in front of you is a well body let me go let me go just a little bit further in this quote he sets his faith his faith sets his destination where where he's headed for because faith is a substance of things hoped for the evidence of things you don't see taste feel smell or here but by faith when he catches that word it sends him into a dimension what is a vision it's another dimension it's a six sense but by faith when he catches that word it sends him come on somebody your Revelation takes you from this Dimension to this that Dimension a dimension where you can't live right a dimension where you can't have hope to a dimension where the Rapture is oh blessed be the name of the Lord your faith set that destination well what is it faith says I'm Healed faith says I'm whole faith says I have a miracle faith says I have a right faith I'm Not Looking Through The Eyes of My emotions I'm Not Looking Through The Eyes of my feelings I'm Looking Through The Eyes of the vision of the word that Vision has set my destination my faith ain't on Le O my faith ain't on this world my faith ain't in this on these natural things but my faith my Revelation is in this word because all of your natural senses will fail you but faith will never fail fail you a vision will never fail a vision is thus sayith the Lord a vision can not fail the reason while I'm in this church is the Reon cuz I don't want to be lost the reason I'm in this church I got a reason to be here now maybe your faith don't see what I see but my faith says I'm going in a Rapture my faith says I'm going to make it I'm in a [Applause] vision I know a lot of times that we want to move the Hat we want to make things just work out we want to make it work we want to put this one Church we're going to put this we're going to bring this one in we're going to bring that prodical in we going to do this we going to do that but it it ain't our duty to move the Hat it ain't our duty to make things happen it's our duty to believe now the prophet said to believe the word is to receive the word and to let it become life and when you receive a word from another world you capture something that the world doesn't know nothing about so faith is our vision well give me an example brother Andrew I'm glad that I've got a line of them for you because John Ryan when he come through the prayer line S for ruanne he looked there and the prophet said you're healed and he went back out there and he was still Bri and brother John Ryan got back in that line and he stood before the prophet and the prophet looked down and he said you done been through here he said you said I was healed brother Rand said you said you believed he said by thus sayith the Lord you're healed and John Ryan went everywhere testifying that he had his vision back he had his vision back now maybe you don't see the message fully in the capture of the eyes Through The Eyes through the glass through the glass clearly but maybe you're still looking through it Darkly but let me put it to you like John Ry keep saying I'm Healed I'm Healed I'm Healed I got my eyesight I got my baby I got my healing I got my breakthrough I got my joy I got my restoration I got my dance I'm Healed I'm [Applause] Healed what was it his natural vision hadn't changed but his spiritual vision had maybe you don't see the baby coming maybe you don't see Abraham and sayah having a baby yet maybe you don't see me in the Rapture just yet but I want you to know there's a bride on Earth that her natural vision has stepped into the world of a spiritual vision and she's not identified with natural things come on your job's just a natural thing your work's just a natural thing your car is just a natural thing the things of this life are just a natural thing but we're not feeding on that if that was all our vision we'd surely be disappointed wouldn't we but I got my eyes on something else I ain't got my eyes on a failure I ain't got my eyes on mistakes I got my eyes on a cross I got my eyes on a lamb I love what brother brandom said and looking at the Unseen he said we used to see he used to in that old church used to sing this little song like this he said I've crossed that separating line and I've left the World Behind he said if there ever was a time that the church needs to step across that line which separates you between faith and unbelief by sight and look at the Unseen by faith it's now that's when you leave everything behind you every care every weary everything that says you can't be a Christian i've smoked too long I've drank too long brother brandom I've lived in adultery I don't care what you say I don't care what you done though your sins be a Scarlet you once you once pass that line of barrier of the devil trying to torment you say you can't do it you can't do it and say I can do it for Jesus said that whosoever will let him come and drink from the Waters of the Fountain of Life freely and leave it behind look at your neighbor said leave it behind leave your past in the past and put your future ahead of you the Bible said in 1 Peter 1:8 whom having not seen you love in whom though now you see him not yet believing you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of Glory receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls is out in front of you it's out in front of you if you can line your vision up with the word there's a lot of people that's got eyesight there's a lot of people that's got Visions for the day there's a lot of people that's got goals that they call Visions but this bride is in prophetic vision and she's stepping in March she's stepping in line with it she's in line she's in line because the prophet told her get back in line and when the world tried to get her out of line she steps back in line because the prophet would say there's a well person in front of you you see I want to put it in your eyes tonight there's a well person in front of you the word already sees you healed the word wants to change your focus to his vision not your vision he said right out in front of you stands a person just like you just a few minutes ago you were sick down here but there is a well person standing there and Jesus Christ is calling to that well person right Beyond it I'm G to let you line up yourself right here I'm going to let you stand up and I'm going to let you recognize that there's a well person standing in front of you I don't care if it's your mental status I don't care if it's whether you're questioning a message or whether you need understanding on the message I want to put this in front of you that Jesus Christ is calling to a well person come on somebody we are a body of Jesus Christ and if you're out there on some far off limb you you are not a wellbody but Jesus Christ is calling to a wellbody he's calling to it he said now you just by faith as you close your eyes you walk right into that well body then just keep walking just keep going on if I could put it in the eyes that in front of Titus is a wellbody with no more meniscus tears no more surgeries as a prophet would say just walk right into it just walk right into it one of these days you're going to walk right into a body that cannot corrupt no more and you're just going to walk by Faith you're going to walk right into it you're going to walk right into it I know what I'm talking about it happened this week brother it just happened this week brother Chester my wife was sitting there praying sitting there praying and after after coming back from the meetings in in Canada or Washington there after much speaking I'd completely lost my voice and after last weekend I I was in bad shape Sunday and Monday I was bad shape I couldn't hardly talk sound like I had lar Andes I had to sing in a wedding on Thursday and I called my sister and said look you going to have to do it I ain't got a voice but while my wife was praying I felt a physical Touch come on my body and restore my voice back because I kept saying this how can they hear without preacher Lord and she started lining her prayer up and all of a sudden was standing out in front of me a wellbody and by prayer of faith I simply stepped into it now Jesus said with man this is impossible but With God all things are possible he said the Gentile way is to believe the word just like when Martha was down there at the grave and she'd met the word of God before she could ever see the miracle of God she had to believe the word of God and to act upon it I got somewhere I'm going but this is the right moment if you wouldn't mind playing that clip for me and turn the turn the volume up well come on somebody you might as well what's Shannon been praising the Lord about his son ain't even made it in the building but God has never discounted his faith he never asked him did you believe me he didn't question his faith he kept acting on it he kept believing it whether he seen it or whether he [Applause] didn't what are you doing I'm acting on my faith I'm beli it what is this brother Andrew it's a refreshing of the Dynamics one of these days you going to praise before you see it some of these days you going have to shout before you know [Applause] it that was one year ago today I had no idea I had had no idea but the word of the Lord woke me up this morning with them words brother Shannon and said you got to praise before you see it you got to act before you know it and he sent me that clip this [Applause] evening well he's in the building now come on Martha come on Martha before you see Lazarus you got to act upon it you got to speak it your vision has got to be fixed according to the word of the Lord come on somebody we've been waiting for this moment we've been living for this moment and we're here don't let it pass you [Applause] by before you see the mountain before you see a roll way still speak to it make sure that the words that are coming out of your mouth are aligning with the vision that you want to see how many times did we ask brother Shannon how many times did we speak how many times did we praise we didn't see it but we was acting on it but now our faith has become sight I know you don't believe this I know some of you don't believe this but there's an angel in this room and he's waking up prodal and he's telling them to come back home come back home it's time the season is now I say this unto you arise I of your Slumber get out of the hog pin come on prodal wake up there's an angel here and he's knocking get up out of your mess get up out of your pig pin it's time to wash the hog it's time to clean off the makeup it's time to clean off the trash it's time to clean it up and to go back home and he's in a spot of repentance so I'm not worthy to go back to my father's house and be caught a son I'm not worthy to go back there but let me just go back and be a servant and there's a spot of your Britain they said but I will now arise I love love the word I love the word because the Bible said that when there he was a far off there was a far off that the father saw him let me say it like this the father saw you in your doubt the father saw you in your Calamity the father saw you in your sin the father saw you in your mistake the father saw you still covered up with filth the father still saw you covered up in sin the father saw you in that but I love what the scripture said that the father ran ran to him and had companion on him he didn't make him a servant said Son you always was a son and you always will be a son I say this unto you get your head out of the H you're not a servant you're not a slave get your vision lined up with the father's Vision in the words of brother Ron Spencer It's Time to Kill the fatty calf and have a party let's have a [Applause] party for this promise is unto you and to them that are a far off the ones you don't see the ones that you're praying for the one [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah what's your vision testifying about is your V Vision testifying that you're still in a pit or is your vision fixed that I'm a son of the king and I know that I am yes I am and I know that I am I'm telling you it's time to go let's have a party let's have a party let's have a party let's have a party don't just bring g r bring my kingly ropes and put them on them put my tent put my Tabernacle put it on them now I want to ask you this you got the blood on you you got the blood over your heart you got the blood over your life you got the blood over your mind the blood cell the broken blood cell is the life of Jesus Christ it's over your heart it's over your eyes it's over your spirit and it's over your soul now what do you see what do you see do you see what the doctor see or do you see what he says do you see he or do you see complications do you see do you see disappointments or do you see opportunities I have put myself in line for a miracle I a believe that you put yourself in line for it I want you to set your eyes come in into these meetings I want you to set your expectation to a level that you've never experienced before I want you to expect the unexpected I want you to believe for the unbelievable I want you to ask for the things that don't seem even real I'm going to close right there is Can you capture what God's got in his eyes Abraham do you see who you are he didn't just come to anybody's tent he came to your tent Moses you're not just anybody he came to you David you're not just anybody you're a man after his own heart Brad you're not just another church you are somebody special that the King of Kings would allow you to capture a vision of what he's had in his mind that the prophet would say notice the harmony between the bride and the groom that she knows what he wants done with the word that she's put herself in line with with it she didn't step out and tried to make up her own Doctrine she stayed right in line with it because she's in Perfect Harmony it's like it's like sweet love music you ever watch somebody can't dance it's a funny thing they're tripping all over their feet they don't know what they're doing they're stagging around but if you've ever watched The Art of it that it's perfectly in line and in time with the music that they've timed it out perfectly they know where to step at they know where to be at and this bride is moving not with a dead God but with a living God and she's perfectly in line and in rhythm with the music she knows what he wants done with the word she can say the dress fits I don't have to trim nothing off of it it's perfect in every way I always I always loved it always thought it was one of the best things sister Devon you'd always step out there on the side of that aisle and just give God a chance while the music was playing she just step out and give her God a chance if he wanted to use me to dance she was putting herself in line for it and all of a sudden the Holy Spirit came up and became her partner started dancing with her and then the word of the Lord came by your way when nobody else wanted you and when nobody else would step out the word captured your affections and your attention and it called you and it puts you in line with the vision of what he saw in you what do you see May the musicians come hallelujah hallelujah oh Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus Jesus look for in his wonderful face and the things of this world will grow strange lead him in the life of his glory and grace just
