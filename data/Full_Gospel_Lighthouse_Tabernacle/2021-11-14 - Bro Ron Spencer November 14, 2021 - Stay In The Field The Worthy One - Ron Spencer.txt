wednesday uh on on our this past tuesday we had a lot of scans and checkups and we got good news and the brain tumors are not growing we're really happy about that they're there but they're not growing we're really happy about that then we had more tests the rest of the day sometimes you don't get the news that you want to get but you know who's in control and so we got more tests coming on this wednesday we don't know exactly what our future holds as far as different tests and different things and but we know we have a great god that hears and answers prayer and so we are thankful to have a good team of doctors that cares and loves us and and seems to call us about every day and and so but we thankful to have a higher physician that says i got this and so amen isn't he good to us amen i'm forgetting something and i'm amen well i'll just go to this we have a baptismal service on november the 27th and the 28th weekend that will be we'll have it on that sunday but we will be two weeks from now and so if you're if you have not been baptized it's one of the things that you must do and so make sure you get that taken care of i can't do it for you and so we're not we're not mormons we don't we don't baptize for the dead and so you got to do that that's one of the things and remember this to have your sins remitted you must be baptized and so that's acts chapter 2 and verse 38 and so want to get that taken care of in your life don't wait till you get on death's door and try to make it way through another way if you've got you've got good health in your being repent and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost there's only one baptism that's given there in the scriptures and that's the way that they were baptized in the name of jesus christ not in the titles of father son holy ghost that's a catholic teaching and so if you've been baptized in a catholic teaching make sure that you i'm not going to ask every one of you have you been baptized the right way if you have not been baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ we want to get that done amen we want to get that done i'm not going to hammer you but that's a scriptural promise and to see the opening of the word you got to step through some doors to get through it and so amen there was a day she was just a girlfriend but today she's the queen so amen good to be queen in it amen maybe next time he'll take you some someplace warm amen amen if you'll turn with me to revelations chapter five we are going to extend from last night and last week on staying in the field i read something this week that stood out to me and i'll share this with you this is the day that the lord hath made and we will rejoice and be glad in it rainy days are loved by farmers snowy days are loved by children who can stay home from school and sister connie storms are loved by mystery fanatics and sister katie gray days are loved by romantics sunny days are loved by picnickers warm days are loved by beachgoers cool days are loved by those who stroll all days have their purposes under heaven enjoy the day that the lord has made and he has many more of those days to share with you amen in the season of my life i've learned that i'm not promised tomorrow so i must enjoy this day many times we're looking for miracles that that are almost hollywood-like but let me just say today is a miracle that we share together so let's enjoy this day if we can do that today we want to speak on the worthy one we want to speak on the worthy one no man no prophet was willing to pay the price no man was willing to pay the price but our lord jesus was not ashamed of her past and he was willing to buy back our redemption for that we begin this morning revelations chapter 5 and this is a very important passage for the message believers and i saw in the saw in the right hand of him that set on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals and i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and i wept much because no man was found worthy to open the book and to read neither to look thereon and one of the elders saith unto me weep not behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof and i beheld and low in the midst of the throne of the four beasts and the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it has been slain having seven horns seven eyes which are the spirits of god sent forth into all the earth and he came and he took the book out of the right hand of him that sat on the throne and when he had taken the book the four beasts and the four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them hearts and golden vials full of odors which are the prayers of the saints now here is what we do and they sung a new song our song is a song of redemption thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and redeemed us to god by the blood out of every kindred tongue and people and nation and has made us unto our god kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth let's pray lord jesus we love you today we thank you to stand here before this awesome audience we pray that you would bless them in a supernatural way anoint your servant of god to speak the words of life strengthen us father touch my body this evening father we ask you that you administer to us may the word go to its direct spot now we ask you to minister to brother harold we pray as a body of believers when doctors have done all that they can do that's when jesus takes over father you're our high priest you're you're the intercessor you're the great one that paid the price of redemption you took those stripes at paula's judgment hall that we could be healed we believe there's still purpose in brother harold's life and we ask you to raise him up to fulfill that purpose in jesus christ's name we pray and the the bride of christ says amen you can be seated hebrews chapter 1 kind of says it and describes it all for us god who at sun dry times and divers manners spake us to spake in times past unto the fathers by the prophets so each one of those prophets was an attribute being displayed on the earth whether it was joseph whether it was jonah whether it was nehemiah or nahum or micah all of those prophets moses being one of the most standout men all of those prophets were a display of what god wanted to say to the bride of christ of that day and so people had to realize this is our prophet this is god's mouthpiece to us now notice god just didn't stop once moses's message was over or once noah's message was over it was pushing forward to a messiah because moses couldn't die for his sins nehemiah could not die for his sins because remember we're all under adam's curse when they walked out of the garden of eden it was god that called them back and took sheepskins something had to die to cover them and god made a covenant with adam that he would restore him now what adam stepped out of he stepped out of an eternal realm into a time realm and what we're getting ready to do is go from a time realm to an eternal realm [Music] hallelujah sister sharon good to see you amen i'm thankful for a young lady that'll drive four hours to come to church so god bless you sister sharon amen now notice this hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of all things by whom also he hath made the worlds who be in the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholding all things unto the word by power which he had by himself purged our sins nobody else could do that nobody else could do that purged our sins sat down at the right hand of the majesty upon high being made so much better than the angels as he had by an inheritance obtained a better obtained a more excellent name than they he came in his father's name now remember this for and and again for unto which the angel said he at any time thou art my son this day have i begotten thee and again i will be to him a father and he shall be to me a son and again when he bringeth in the first begotten into the world he said and let all the angels of god worship him are you with me now and and the angels he said who maketh his angels spirits and ministers of a flame of fire but unto his son he said thy throne o god is forever and ever a scepter of righteousness is the scepter of my kingdom thou hast loved righteousness and hated iniquity therefore god even thy god hath anointed thee with the all of gladness above thy fellows i read all of that to say this to you jesus will never be just one of the boys hallelujah he is king of kings and he's lord of lords he is the mighty god he is the everlasting father he is the prince of peace [Applause] hallelujah understand when the book of ruth is written to most theologians it is considered a love story maybe even questioned why it would even be placed in the chronicles of the scriptures when the book of enoch was not placed in the scriptures when other great writings was not placed in the scripture great arguments are read about you can read about them a great argument why was ruth placed there but only under the ministry of the son of man of this day when the seals are released you could go back the breach it testifies of what ruth was that there was church ages but we needed a messenger to come in this day are you with me to take us from church ages and elevate the word and open the word where it would not be a reformer of a man or not be the thoughts of a man probing at the word but god wanted to open the book remember he couldn't allow that to a man but he being the author could step forth in this day now listen he don't do it just to see if he can do it he's got a bride that's attributes that he thought of before the foundation of the world [Music] no the world will never understand it don't expect denominations to open their arms and say we love this message it wasn't for them i don't know i don't know how to say it any different hawks eat hulk food buzzards eat buzzard food but eagles are for prophetic people that are a prophetic class that will eat a prophetic word [Music] so when we look back in the scriptures as much as god used prophets to speak god uses a man like joseph to be in a dungeon and then to be elevated to the prince god uses a man like jonah you can argue a lot of ways jonah actually said throw me off i'm the man throws him in the ocean and a fish a great fish swallows jonah a fish that was prepared swallows jonah and he's going to be a type of jesus christ he'll lay three days in the earth and jesus will stand on the earth in human form and look back to jonah that many will look like as a backsid sliding prophet but he'll look not at his failure of humanity or not wanting to go and preach the word to that people that he actually hated and let me just say this you and god knew that he had to have an example of jesus laying in the ground in the belly of hell for three days and so jonah displays that now if jesus had a display we have to have a display ruth was our display and she's living her life as a woman a virtuous woman she's worked in the field she stayed in the field last night we read about that she laid at his feet and he asked who are you and she said i am ruth and he gave her instructions to pull the skirt his skirt down over top of her now to the eyes of the beholder you would see that this was not a very clean act but it was actually redemption being displayed by god himself i'll take your shame i'll take your sins i'll take your mistakes you were born in sin and i'm going to redeem you not back to your natural birth but i'm going to redeem you back to your eternal birth i've got to remind you that you came from god and you're going back to god [Applause] you got to see past going past your earthly mother and father they got you here but you've got to look at the eternal realm ruth chapter 4 bears out that boaz finds himself at the gate and he sat down there as as a kinsman redeemer and he has to carry out legal rights god just can't send you to hell or send you to heaven it has to be legally done it has to be legally done if you want to buy a piece of ground from brother mike over here you have to legally buy that ground you have to go through the proper proper avenues to buy that piece of ground when god came to earth he legally has to buy you he can't just i save him i'll pick this one and i'll pick this one no he has to legally because naomi was involved her land was involved amen now understand that i i don't mean to get here but understand it couldn't be transferred from one tribe to another amen are you with me it couldn't be transferred from over to zebulon's tribe because she was in the line of judah so so it couldn't be transferred over there not just anybody can buy the land not just anybody wants to go and and and by the land of a widow and then a daughter that has been come out of the descendants of lot who has worshiped false gods because you have to bring their reputation into your household so he has 10 witnesses to come the nearer kinsman the accuser of the brethren is your nearer fleshly kinsmen but he can't redeem you all your vows and promises won't redeem you but boaz jesus christ is willing to pay the price and it's going to be costly it's going to cost him the blood of the lamb he's got to leave the ivory palaces of heaven take on humanity be to be mocked for over 30 years and then three years spend a life of ministry upon the earth displaying god himself constantly asking do you know who i am do you see who i am and only a handful of people would really get it [Music] bo ass asked the nearer kinsmen will you redeem her well i'll take naomi in the property i'll pay i'll i'll take that i'll take naomi in the property and then boaz reminds him you got to take ruth as well i wish i felt like shouting right now you couldn't redeem yourself so don't get your stuff collar up don't you say i'm so special i you know this church ought to appreciate let me say all of us had sinned and come short of the glory of jesus christ but god raises us from what we was to what we're going to be and only god can do that i can't take her into my house i can't call her my bride can you see how much satan makes fun of you and the church makes fun of you they don't want you but jesus does that's a really good decision [Music] brother ron that's just way off you're just making that up washington is telling us today that they don't want the bride of christ they really don't want the bride of jesus christ as a matter of fact if we would open up on sodom and gomorrah they would arrest me put me in prison but it's the truth anyway but they would call us a cult and brother ron i don't want to be associated with that well if a cult is a small group with one leader jesus fits the bill but if it's a huge group and one leader the catholic church fits the bill i'd rather be with jesus every day of the week don't get your eyes on our messenger our message was sent our messenger was sent to deliver the message he's not your bridegroom he was a phenomenal man but he's not who you fall in love with [Applause] i don't mean that bad let me just say this to you we love brother branham and everything and no disrespect whatsoever but he couldn't die for his sins less long hours he he brought the message and was entrusted with the message are you with me now he couldn't take you in but the holy spirit the angel of the lord is here to finish the work stay in the field wire our kinsmen it's already been paid for then if you will not redeem her i will and not only will i redeem her i'm going to take her as my wife i want to read you a couple of words here in the scriptures this is phenomenal you see you by reading ruth and ruth is written after their lives i wanted to watch what i'm going to do with it just for a moment 4 13. so boaz took ruth and she was his wife and when he went in unto her the lord gave her conception and she bear a son and the women said unto naomi blessed be the lord which hath not left thee this day without a kinsmen that his name may be famous in israel they were speaking prophecy because she was now carrying on naomi without hope her lineage is now carrying on the line of the tribe of judah hallelujah and she thought her plan was completely lost and he and he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life and a nourisher of thine old age for thy daughter-in-law which loved thee which is better to thee than seven sons hath borne him and naomi took the child and laid it in her bosom and and began to nurse unto it and the women her neighbors gave it a name saying this is a son born to naomi amen and they called his name obed and obed is the father of jesse the father of david oh glory [Music] now these are the generations of pharas and pharas begat hezron hezren begat ram and ram begatta bin dab and abinada begat nation a nation begat salmon and salmon begat boaz and and boaz begot obed and obed begot jesse and jesse begot david that's the way the writer wrote it in the book of ruth but let's go forward under the new covenant and the book of generation of jesus christ the son of david the son of abraham and abraham begot isaac and isaac begat jacob and jacob begat judas and his brethren and judas begat pharas and zara of tamar tamar was not mentioned in the old book hallelujah and pharaohs begat israel and ezra begat amram and ambram forget abinadab and a building map got nation and nation begat salmon and salmon are you with me now and someone begat boaz of rahab [Music] and boaz begat obed of ruth and obed begot jesse god didn't overlook these women when it come to matthew when he's writing it the writer of ruth left them out but god didn't forget [Applause] he raised them from that room to the realm of the lineage of the line of the tribe of judah and though their paths be awful he lifted them let me just say this to you god wants to lift you lift you out of laodicea you're more than a church you're more than a people you're more than just believers you are the bride of the lamb of god i'm gonna ask you just a couple questions can you read yourself in the book your friends may go i don't see that but you do your friends look at the very same scriptures and you read and they can't see it but because of the seed from where you're from causes you to see it don't make fun of them in god's kingdom in god's kingdom he has a plan some are gold dollars some are silver dollars some are quarters some are even wooden but they're all in the kingdom be careful who you throw stone at brother branham is in california and he's talking about those hippies up in the mountain he said god's even got seed up in the mountains well john steeman was up in that mountain he was pointing at running making fun of the message and he moves sister sister steven to to florida and he's upset he he moves her everywhere one day she's wanting to go to a baptismal service and john is so mad that she's going to go to a baptismal service and he is in the house and it was one you remember those houses that go you you could run all the way around four rooms in a path and he was making his journey around those four four four rooms and whatever and he was making his journey mad and mad because she was going to that baptismal surface and something happened to him on one of those circles something happened to him and he came around said i'm going with you and she thought this is a trap he has sat outside the church and blowed his horn trying to disrupt the service he's moved us all over the country and he goes to the water baptismal service and he doesn't raise a ruckus but he get baptized [Applause] and the man that fought it like paul fought it the man that fought it so much he became such an advocate for the message of the hour he developed a 60-second sermon and stood at the red light and he preached a second 60-second sermon to those that would hear it two boys walked up to him drinking and he preached to them and those two boys became members of his church and one became his son-in-law [Music] he's one of the heroes of faith in my book he never considered himself a preacher never considered himself a great in-depth preacher but he has been one of my heroes that i looked at as one of the great men of the message of the hour another's name caleb you got his picture do we have a picture of caleb he's another hero i went to his country i preached underground to about 200 people we saw the angel of the lord in the building to us going to church is is almost entertainment or just or just eating the word but to them it's a chance of going to prison to preach the message that i'm preaching this morning in his country cost him going to a hard labor camp do you mind you have it just whenever you have it but let me just say he found himself in the scriptures let me just share this with you how many has ever been in a very large gathering of people that are in a picture maybe 40 50 of you are standing in a picture and you're there you know what you do when you when they show you the picture you find yourself hey you're a bunch of vain people but it's the truth you find yourself in the picture and for most women they go well my hair wasn't just rot 99 of the men not looking at their own hell but you find yourself in the picture was a standing right was it looking right was in the right window of the picture they didn't get me just that of me when you're looking in the word of god you want to find yourself ruth goes back home and she has been given spiritual food in due season she's got to wait on the worthy one she can't do anything to redeem herself and so she simply tarries and waits on the worthy one and she eats the mighty god unveiled and while she's eating the mighty god unveils she sees herself when she's re when she's eating the future home of the of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride she sees herself when she's listening to the mighty god unveiled characteristics of jesus christ abraham revealed abraham restored she sees herself in the book let me just say this to you you can read your yourself in the book when you read revelations chapter 21 and i saw a new heaven and a new earth you're actually reading your future i'm not going to be but another minute or two ruth could not read her future she could only walk into it but you can read your future but it takes faith to step into it it's kind of like my healing i just have to keep trusting him it's the same as the rapture rebecca you can sing right after i get done here kind of like right after the right up to the rapture we've got to trust him up to the moment of change doesn't matter what anybody says it doesn't matter what anybody says we got to trust him we got to walk into it we got to simply walk into it step into it well brother ron we were we're 50 years past the messenger and he's been gone 50 years that's right and god knew it all the time well brother ron is there going to be one of the great ministers preach a sermon that will take us into the rapture oh no no no you just keep eating the book you just keep going to church you keep eating the word and the season will change don't you worry about the season we're in a season of natural change a couple of weeks ago it was at its peak when we were standing at your wedding who do we think that kept all the leaves on one side of the tree swept all of them off just like swept all of them off and on one side of the tree all the leaves were there on the other side it was completely bare the master it's kind of like brother branham standing with an infidel one of the most powerful sermons that brother branham ever preaches was at an infidel's house and he talked and he uses that over and over again that man sitting up there if he can only talk to brother branham brother wood so wanted to tell that that's brother random he's talking to and he simply stopped him because he didn't want flesh and blood to reveal it to him and he talks to him about yellow jacket bitten apples on the ground leaves turning and he said what intelligence tells that tree so what intelligence have told all these trees to change their colors and the sac to go back in the ground cause winter's coming and he says well let me just put a a a glass of water on a post are you with me and then he tells him the same intelligence is telling that tree for the leaves for the for the life to leave those leaves to go back in the ground it's the same intelligence that told me about that woman up on the hill and that man's eyes came open he could have preached him a sermon after sermon after sermon but he stood there and the creator of life knew that that predestinated seed was laying inside of them [Applause] that kind of seems far-fetched well let me just tell you take you back to another story woman bring me a drink bring me a drink i think the chosen series does such a good job with that i probably watched it 200 times that clip woman bring me a drink because i can hear brother branham the hundreds of times that brother branham says woman bring me a drink she brings up a racial issue our fathers worshipped in these mountains now god had not allowed himself to be revealed to none of those denominations help me preach i'm almost done he would not tell them who he was to the hierarchy of the nominal world but to an infidel on the porch excuse me to a woman at the well to a woman at the well he said you've had five husbands and the one you're living with he's not your husband and she knew then she knew then that's him and he said i am he she wasn't welcome at none of those churches she was not welcome at any of those churches but the worthy one are you catching it now the worthy one was sitting with her when they screamed to him come down off of the cross brother random looked at that statement as the greatest compliment they could have given him they thought they were making fun of him and brother brahm said it was the greatest compliment they could give him because he could have but because of redemption like boaz at the gate the price had to be paid and the price was his black men men have a hard time dying for one another but it doesn't redeem nobody but this lamb of god was doing something that the blood of bulls and goats could not do because he was the worthy one and i finished with this the book of redemption when john sees it he's standing between church ages and seals he's chronologically perfectly in the scriptures he's standing between church ages and seals and no man was worthy let me just say this to you spurgeon was a great preacher prince of preachers but he couldn't open the book wesley was a phenomenal reformer and prophet but he couldn't open the book pentecost was an incredible movement but they couldn't open the book and john is standing witnessing as a witness if no man is worthy we're lost if no man is worthy to take the book and to loose the seals thereof and to pay the price of redemption we're lost and the angel speaks to him weep not john behold the lion of the tribe of judah and it could not be complete without rahab without tamar without without boaz and ruth i want to bring it forward it could not be complete without you why has the rapture been delayed why has it been delayed look around the building brother branham said he could not see past 1977 because that's how dark the world became and i would say this world became so wicked in this darkness of laodicea how much worse can it get i sometimes almost boycott the news because i feel so nasty once i read what's going on and what hollywood calls great i find it the putrid of the earth are you with me the commercials that's on your phone is not worthy to even [Applause] god save us from this mess god save us from this mess come on church i'd say this stay in the field stay where redemption's at stay where the resurrection's that stay where the rapture's at you look around and you see this one coming up and that one coming up and that one coming up i haven't calculated this but what year were you born 95. what year were you born 94. train him up like you want him what i'm talking about do you realize that you're 17 years 18 years after brother branham couldn't see past god couldn't come back in 77 because you had to be born because your name was in the book i tell you we ought to tear this place up right now hallelujah mercy said no [Applause] i'm not going to let you go i'm waiting on every last seed that's got to be displayed in the book listen he's the worthy one to god be the glory hallelujah out of the mercy said no i'm not gonna let you go i'm not gonna let you turn slip away you don't have to be ashamed i can't sing but i got somebody that can hallelujah hallelujah i couldn't give this eternal life to my children but the worthy one could sister gabrielle you couldn't give this eternal life to your children but the worthy one did hallelujah he's not just one of the boys he's the lord of lords and he's the king of kings he's my god he's my lord hallelujah hallelujah sister rebecca andrew is going to sing and then i want you to sing if you would do that today for his privileges with that i've known you how old do you think you was when i first met you yeah i'll tell you the year 1994 so you don't have to tell me how old you are it's been a little while you were a kid yeah and she always has radiated to me she's just radiated a presence and and i'm so glad to have her how in the world did you guys find your way to this church and so i just think oh well god god knows how to navigate everything and so we certainly love them with all of our hearts andrew this service would not be complete at the end of the service without you saying it mercy said no and it has more meaning ruth i'm not going to let you go andrew i'm not going to let you go i want to share this with you when andrew began to begin to grow up full of frolic and full of all that nonsense we shared my heart and homer and i recognized there was a gift laying in there you just had to wade through the nonsense and i took him to vancouver both of my boys to vancouver it would be in louisiana where matthew would receive the holy ghost and they would tell me while i was in bed that matthew's speaking in tongues and he spoke in tongues almost all night and that was what i was waiting on because i don't want church members i want real sons somebody told me the other day said you've turned your church over to your boys i say this thanks be to god i got boys worthy to turn this church over too if i would die this week this church will be open next weekend amen and he'll be the pastor of this church but as he begin to develop people got jealous of him made a lot of made a lot of fuss about him but let me just say i like boaz could see what was in ruth i like boaz could see what was in ruth and let all of the people that were jealous let them leave sometimes addition happens by subtraction you don't realize i was really talking about you too because some of your friends when they walk away you have added to your life by subtraction they were just weights on you holding you down but boaz was telling you who you really was out of your womb is going to come the seed of judah out of you [Applause] i'm glad he said i'm not going to let you go stephen as you sung this morning i'm so proud of you singing i i just heard
