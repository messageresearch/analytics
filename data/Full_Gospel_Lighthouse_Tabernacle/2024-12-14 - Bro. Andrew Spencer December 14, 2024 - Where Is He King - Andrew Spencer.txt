you here to the house of the Lord and we just want to say God bless you each and every one of you and certainly been been a lot lot to pray about this week and uh our our church family here sister Teresa and going through what she's going through we just constantly lifting her up in prayer and knows that knowing that God sees every every bit of that so we just pray God would strengthen her in in that that's some tough news to swallow in a in a week and so we just pray God would strengthen her and and we as a church body will lift her up in prayer and there's many others that we are lifting up in prayer as well want to be remembered our brother William uh this weekend as he's there in Georgia that God would uh bless his meeting there abundantly and also brother brother Ron's meeting there brother Wayne's there in Ohio he's ministering there with Brother David mayor this weekend so we just pray the Lord to give them both a good time and we grant them God's speed here tonight and so um uh just to just to make mention if if everybody everybody on on the way internet and also here just I know we got some that that come on Sundays that that are not able to come on Saturdays so they'll probably be listening to the service but there is a strong probability that we uh close service tomorrow um due to the ice and snow that possibly be coming and it could be hit or miss and uh but I will I will make a a call by about 8:30 or 9:00 in the morning just to give ample time for for everybody that would be traveling and so so if anybody that's traveling about 4 hours away you want to you want to just use your own judgment there and uh I'm going to quote one of our Elder deacons here um that you know so this this could be real Hit or Miss I could hit it and we get ice and we you know it was the right thing to do or I could miss it completely and uh we don't get no I and we still don't have service so but I'm going to quote one of our Elder deacons here he said then he said it he said it kind of like this if if uh if one service makes you backslide you're in a pretty bad spot so so so we know we know I'm just ain't nobody wants to cancel service more and uh I I hate to cancel service but I I also want to use some real wisdom here in that and I don't want to take any chances getting anybody hurt so so you just be praying for us that we make the right decision and and uh so you just we're in that season of of snow right now so uh you know for the next couple months these possibilities could happen you well well it might not be snowing at your house well it might be snowing right here on this hill and this hill is it's a beautiful Hill to be on when the when the colors are changing and getting a pretty view but going off that thing in a sled is it's not something you want to do so oh uh we we just don't want to take any chances with that and so we believe in the power of prayer and we believe on laying hands on sick but I don't want to have to do it right after service after you get off this hill so so we just we just going to use some real wisdom tomorrow so uh you look for that text message or or or whatever and if you know somebody that doesn't get that church text if you wouldn't mind just reaching out to them we've tried to gather everybody that we can but sometimes people change their phone numbers and some things just slide through the cracks there so so uh you just you just bear with us tomorrow morning but either way tonight I got something real good for you and and I tell you what I believe it's I believe I've been blessed today studying it and this week we and so we just want to labor some things that are on our heart this this evening if you have your Bibles we'd like to look over into three portions of the scripture in 2 Samuel chapter 7 Luke chapter 1 and Matthew Chapter 2 I'd like to just fall right in line with our thought last weekend on the demand for a king and uh I know I lost my voice but I'm not going to repr preach that that sermon so you can say thank you and and but I I I want to Garner some things and and just gather some things from that thought and Lord just giv us some fresh inspiration here in this in this Christmas season we just want to be mindful of the lord we know that's where the people's minds are so just Gathering some inspiration here from the from the scriptures we just looking unto the Lord here tonight amen amen we just we love the Lord with all of our heart don't we with all our heart he's so good to us so we just we just want to go before the Lord in prayer tonight how many has a need that you'd like to make known unto the Lord amen God sees each and every one of your hands let's just bind our faith together for all those that that couldn't be here tonight and those that would long to be here and uh just pray the Lord blesses them abundantly while we're here in the house of the Lord amen and Jesus said where two or three are gathered in my name there I am in the midst of them and I know that we've got some real situations here in our church and things that are spoken and things that are unspoken and I I believe that God is able to meet every one of these needs he's faithful so let's just go to him in prayer tonight Heavenly Father we approach you Lord Jesus Through Your Divine Mercy Lord we realize Lord because of the broken blood cell of Jesus Christ that we have access to come before you bold Lord Jesus to know you and to handle you it lord it's one of the greatest things of our life to be able to speak the name of Jesus Christ across our lips when people are born as a mute and never being able to speak that holy name and we get to pray it often as Christian Believers we get to speak your name and we realize that when we speak that name that Demons Run for Cover father I I've studied some things out about that name and how powerful that it is and how how Satanist and how even satanic Powers cannot even cannot even go around the name of Jesus Christ so father we realize Lord that the enemy would try to keep us from performing all of our actions and everything that we do and say in the name of Jesus so father we we come to you tonight and Lord there's uplifted hands there's unspoken and spoken request here and I pray father that you would move out across these needs just now and that you'd be ever so mindful of your people we are looking unto you the author and the finisher of our faith and we ask father Lord that you would Minister to us through the preaching of Thy word tonight minister to us and we'll be able to get oursel out of the way Lord and be able to say that it was good for us to walk with you and talk with you and our hearts burned oh god with the scriptures that were laid Upon Our Hearts but Lord don't let us fail to recognize you are in our midst so God we commit this service to you father and we ask God that you would just pour out your spirit and give us an an upper room experience as it were maybe it's not a maybe it's not 120 maybe it's not 250 maybe it's just one that needs a needs to know you as Savior and I pray father that you would come tonight and you'd be king in this place in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen 2 Samuel 7 and verse 12 and when thy day days be fulfilled Thou shalt sleep with thy fathers and I will set up thy seed after thee which shall proceed out of thy bows and I will establish his kingdom and he shall build an house for my name this isn't just talking about Solomon this is just talking about our Lord he shall he shall build an house for my name and I will establish the Throne of his kingdom forever I will be his father and he shall be my son if he commit iniquity I will chasen him with the rod of men and with the stripes of the Children of Men We realize by these scriptures that we are looking at our Lord Jesus Christ in prophetic form but Jesus is not going to commit iniquity he is going to carry your iniquities and by that he is going to take your stripes that you are willing that you were supposed to have but he is going to willingly take the iniquity of men upon him but my Mercy shall not depart away from him as I took it from Saul whom I put away before thee and thine house and thy kingdom shall be established forever before thee thy Throne shall be established forever Luke 1 and verse 30 and the angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou Hast found favor with God and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name Jesus and he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the Throne of his father David and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end Matthew Chapter 2 and verse 1 now when Jesus was born born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king behold there came wise men from the East to Jerusalem saying where is he that is born King of the Jews for we have seen his star in the east and are come to worship Him may God bless his word you may be seated here tonight in the presence of the almighty God and His angels and his Saints and we'd like to speak to you a little thought here tonight on where is he King where is he King now brother Brandon would say this in events made clear by prophecy he said not one time has it ever missed and it won't for who are predestinated to see it will see it Jesus said no man can come to me except except my father draws him and all that the father has given me will come it's the word joining with the word it can't do nothing else so for whoever is destinated will see it it's the word joining with the word and we realize that when God has something that is that is laying there in his great architectural mind he has something that is laying there that he's going to fulfill in a certain season or in a certain time that God is going to have he's going to have somebody a believer that is going to call for it or a believer that is in position to point out that this is the event of that time or the event of his coming because God is the god of supply and he understands the concept of supply and demand just like it was in the days of in the days of Egypt when Egypt was going getting ready to go through a famine he had a son of prosperity that was in position to take care of a limping Prince or a prince that was with power you see when Joseph or when Joseph was in position he wasn't just preserving Egypt but he was going to be taken care of Israel at the same time because God is the god that supplies all of our needs when you look at it at the the Widow of zerath when she was there when she was in her time of need and she'd got down to her very last meal you see there was a demand in her life for provision and the god of the god of the Bible had sent a prophetic messenger down there that had been supplied by Angelic Porters been feeding there by the book of terth but yet he was a God that was going to supply something more than just a prophetic realm but he was going to feed somebody that was in need or was demanding something so God had a prophetic Ministry that would go by her way and would literally give her spiritual food in new season because God is the god of Supply just like it was in the days of Jesus when the 5,000 that had been following him for the right reasons when they got into this position they were following him because of his teachings but they were lacking sustenance in their life and the demand was great for this crowd that was following Jesus so Jesus literally became the supply for the demand in that situation because Jesus understood what it takes that there was a demand so he became the supply and took two two fishes and five loaves of bread and met the demand of that hour and you can look at it and all throughout all the scriptures you can find that Jesus is the kind of God that will supply any demand that is is there and the scriptures are saying there in Deuteronomy 17:14 and 15 that God is going to supply a the demand for a king that is coming into when these people come into their position they're going to demand him of a king so God is going to he's going to he's going to supply them with the kind of King that he he has had in his mind and in his heart because God is the god of Supply somebody say that with me tonight that God is the god of Supply you know you know the the letter of to the Philippians said in in chapter 4 and 19 that my God shall supply all your needs according to his poor Glory no it's absolutely not poor Glory but it's according to his riches and glory in by Christ Jesus he is a God that will supply all of your needs I don't know what you are in need of here tonight or in need of in your life but I believe that God can supply whatever you have need of you see and Israel was in a spot where they were demanding a king and you just just give me a brief minute here just to lay out some some history here just to to to illustrate some things but you see Israel had got thems themselves in a position where they're wanting to be like the rest of the world but God was going to supply them with Kings but these Kings were not going to meet their demand you see you see there there under the United monarchy when when when the Kings begin to rise in power we realize that the first king of Israel was was Saul and he led campaigns and he he would go against the Philistines and he would he would unite the tribes of Israel together but ultimately he disobeyed God and he lost God's favor you then you see David coming to view he was a known he was known as a man after God's Own Heart he defeated Goliath he United Israel and he made Jerusalem the capital and he and he he authored many Psalms that you and I realize were prophetic forms of Jesus Christ and even is even prophetic for this day that you and I are living in and David didn't go nowhere without the Ark of the Covenant and he was he was responsible for bringing the Ark of the Covenant back to Jerusalem Solomon if you look at his accomplishments in his kingship he was he was known for his renowned wisdom that was given to him by almighty God he was he was used by God to build the first temple that God had in his mind and there he be to expand Israel's wealth and their influence but if you study out Solomon's life Solomon as a king begin to fall into idol worship later on in his life and then you come into a period of the divided monarchy when you see Kings rising up in theing Kings of uh of kings of Judah which is in the southern Kingdom the king of that is known as a the the his name is rabam and his accomplishments as a king are his harsh his harshness that he that he he he had such harsh tactics that he literally cused the kingdoms Divine that's a that's a that's a pretty tough deal that he had such harsh ways that he be to divide these kingdoms that had been United together that's the kind of King you don't want right there that brings division instead of of of unity but in it all Judah remained they remained loyal to David and his and his lineage then you see Jehoshaphat raise up and you you see him and in his accomplishments as a as a king he he literally he strengthened Judah spiritually and he begin to go in there and he begin to remove Idols he was known as a man that sought God but he was also known as a man that had questionable alliances in his kingship he would identify himself with different Kings and he would he would be a man that God would that brother Ram would say he was a he was a he was a God man but he he also if you study out he was he was standing with some uh pretty questionable characters as well and then you see under that under the king of Judah you seeing you see Hezekiah that rises up and when you when you see these Kings rise up you begin to see hope that is lifted back into Israel you begin to see men like Hezekiah was a king that trusted God he he he completely he completely put his full intent on serving God he he he he loved the Lord he actually came in there and he reformed the worship back to the true and living God and he resisted an Assyrian Invasion and he is known for his powerful prayers and the faith that he had in almighty God and you remember when you go to studying out the book of kings that you'll find that there Hezekiah in 2 Kings 14 you'll find that Hezekiah that the that the king that the king of Assyria sent a cherb that he he literally he starts mocking he starts mocking the kingship and he starts telling people that they can't trust in the leadership over there in Israel and and he brings up all kinds of Lies against him and he and he starts bringing in all these kinds of threats and he and he starts literally mocking the the the the the leadership there in Israel and and he and here's S A cherup he comes in and I I'm just going to say it because I I don't know I don't I I'll say it but I don't think I'm saying it right but sin chera brings in his messenger ra rakah and he brings in and he brings in these letters he brings in a letter and he begins to insult God he begins to insult Israel he begins to insent he begins to insult Hezekiah and he brings all these things in there but instead of Hezekiah succumbing to the fear of it of the tactics of the enemy Hezekiah takes these letters that have come in against him and they they come in there and they've got all these basically witchcraft ideas that they are bringing against the church and Hezekiah lays them he goes into the house of the Lord and he lays out the mocking and the threatenings he lays out the mocking and the threatenings of of Israel's of Israel's of uh mockers that are there and he literally goes in there and he prays such a powerful prayer that the people on the outside of the Tabernacle feel the influence of hezekiah's prayer and hezekiah's prayer brought one Angel he brought one Angel and destroyed 185,000 Assyrians because Hezekiah knew how to pray I believe that we are living in an hour where we see a fall and demise of people but we also see a rise in people that know how to pray that believe in God no matter what they come up against men like Hezekiah women like Deborah that that knew how to praise God in the midst of people that would not worship God that would not pray to God there was somebody in the midst of the cursing of the enemy God raised up some prayer warriors Hezekiah you study out his life Hezekiah had spent time with God he literally gets a death warrant on his life from the prophetic Ministry and he turns towards the wall and said God I'm not done with my time yet he said I'm not done with my time here yet so I'm asking you for some more years on my life and that might be you you may not have had that time to advance and destroy your enemy like the way that you think that you should so literally what I'm telling you to do as a king of the Lord is to turn your face towards the wall and begin to pray and weep to God and let God roll back the time in your life I believe there's such power in your prayer brother Tommy Richmond sent me a sent me a clip this week of of how powerful that prayer is studying out this thought he sent me this and I thought it was quite profound he sent me of of three uh ex satanists that had became Christian how that they would how that they would work in their Realms of uh of Satanism that they would work in there and they would literally they would they would I don't know any other way to say it but basically teleports from here to there and basically they would try to curse this neighborhood or curse C that neighborhood and this Satanist said he he said I was he said I was literally he said I was I I left this place and I went over here and I was trying to curse this neighborhood he said but he said whatever I did I could not curse that neighborhood he said and the reason I found out that I couldn't curse it was because it was a Christian neighborhood and those Christians were praying the prayer of faith over top of that neighborhood that God would keep that neighborhood and God would bless that neighborhood so that Satanist was not able to place a curse there I tell you how powerful that it is that Satan cannot curse what God has already blessed one of one of those Satanist that had that had turned to a Christian he said one time he said we were having a a a Satanism rally he said we were having this rally he said we would gather together and he said we we were sitting there and he said we was trying to curse these people he said and all of a sudden he said an orange he said an orange Cloud came and hung over there in the corner he said and he said we gathered back together he said and all of a sudden that orange Cloud be to rage he said rage and he said out of it spoke a voice and said whatever you do never send me to a Christian again never send me to a Christian again now one thing to recognize is how manipul live that the Satan is I thought it pretty powerful that a Satanist said that an orange Cloud appeared and how close that Satan likes to get to the real thing of a amber colored light coming into a room setting over top of a prophet setting over top of a people but that powerful how powerful that it is that Satan would come back those demons from that world that would Transformer them things transform themselves as angels of light would say don't you ever send me to a Christian's home again I said let's keep up our prayer life that the devil says don't you send me back down there no more don't send me back down I'll say you got that kind of a power as a king to pray that kind of a prayer that Satan doesn't know what to do with you I believe I'm talking to them kind of people I'll tell you what kind of people that you are it doesn't matter how old you are because God raised up a king by the name of Josiah that was 8 years old and started reigning in Judah and he started reforming the worship and when he turned 20 years old he completely cast down every Idol that was in Judah when his daddy wouldn't do it God raised up a Josiah that would cast down idol worship so what am I saying I'm saying there's some 8-year-old boys and some 8-year-old girls maybe their mom ain't living the message and maybe their daddy ain't living the message but God raise up some so Josiah God rais us up some Josiah that'll return us back to true worship then zedekiah comes in he's the last king before the Babylonian EX he's got a personal friendship and his counselor is Jeremiah but even in that he still did evil in sight of the Lord and He begin to lead Jerusalem to their utter fall so you can have William brandham as a friend you can have him as your counselor you can listen to 1,00 sermons and you can still do evil in sight in the sight of the Lord so it doesn't matter what you been listening to what matters is who's on your heart come on somebody I will say this that there are people that listen to the message and read their Bible and pray and still go to a devil's hell I know that might sound extreme but that's how extreme that is between a born- again believer and a nonborn again believer there's a lot of people that read the Bible that are not bride material there's a lot of people that wear wear the standard of Holiness but are not red material there's a lot of people that look like a king but are never crowned come on somebody look at absolum look at David's son when Solomon was a rightful one to step into Power he starts walking into the fellowship of being a king but a prophet comes and ordains that Solomon is to be king so just because you declare you're King does not make you a king I got heavy smile at your neighbor said hands brother Andrew loves me and then you and then you step into the Kings of Israel in the northern kingdom and you see jeroboam rise up and his accomplishments are he's the first King of the North and he's introducing idol worship back into bethl and Dan again then you see Ahab rise up and he he begins to promote baale worship through his wife Jezebel and his ministry is to confront Elijah through a woman then you see ju who rise up because he's anointed to be king he's anointed by Prophet Eli by the prophet Elisha he goes in there and under his anointing he kill he kills Jezreel the evil king of jehoram he goes in there and by his Ministry he casts down Jezebel and he begins to eradicate all of bell worship throughout all the land but even in J's Zeal for the true and worship God J still tolerated cath worship and idol worship down there in bethan Dan then you see ho HOSA rise up he's the last king of Israel and his Rebellion against Assyria led to the fall of Israel and the Exile of the 10 tribes and then you come on the on the post Exile side of things and you see Kings like zerubba will rise up he's under the descendants of David who led who led the rebuilding of the temple under the Persian rule so basically when you when you see zerubabel you can picture him with a blueprint of the of the temple back in his hand and he's standing there back in his rightful spot and he's going to establish it back again but then there comes another king and this is where things get begin to get interesting is because because this King by the by the name of Herod the Great he begins to represent an architectural Legacy and he starts standing before a grand Temple and he starts rebuilding and adding on his own thoughts to what needs to be added he is the king that is in position when the true king comes you say what all that what is all that about brother Andrew I I said all that to say this is that Earthly Kings can never meet the demand they can never meet the demand so so your your your emotions can never meet the demand for the supply that you need your conscience cannot meet the demand your affections cannot meet the demand are you with me I'm going through your five five rounds of your spirit they can never meet the demand but there's something deeper there's something greater than your just Earthly spirit and your Earthly body because we contact This World by these five senses here but there is something greater that you do not see that is residing even when your affections are against you even when your emotions are against you even when your conscience is against you there is something that the king deposited you see when when when Herod didn't see it and when zerubba didn't see it let me go back to a little bit further when Ahab didn't see it there was coming a king that was going to remain King because Saul was going to live and he was going to die David was going to live and he was going to die Solomon was going to live and he was going to die Ahab was going to live and Ahab was going to die you see there was a demand for eternal life from a king so God raised up his only son because God was tired of Earthly Kings failing him so he had a demand so he he supplied his own son hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I tell when you run ragged when you're at the end of your rope I'll say that God's got the pillar of fire that is right there to guide you when you are when you're at the end of your at the end of your wits he's the kind of God that will supply all of your needs I say it in Earthly Realms in financial Realms in spiritual Realms I say there is a demand for a body to be changed and God has got to supply I I tell you there ain't nobody like my king because my king he rules with Justice he leads with Mercy his actions declare his humility his kingdom is eternal and unshakable he is not just the king of one land the king of the Jews but he is the king of the Gentiles he is the king of all Nations because he had three wise men that came from all the way of the the other side of India that was led by the supernatural so we could say it like this he's the king of Africa he's the king of Ireland he's the king of England he's the king of Canada he's the king of America he's the king of all lands for all people and that same God that anointed a star to show up at the right time has anointed the seventh star to show up in this time to direct the supernatural people by their ordination by their election and the reason why you're following this seven star it shows that God put something on the inside of you that the world will never get out of you Hallelujah begin to study this event begin to look at this event of this light coming no man could come to the father except he draws him now no man can understand how great he is unless he allows him to know him so God has allowed a supernatural element to be released in this hour brother Shannon so that you could understand you're a part of the headship so that you could begin to recognize that there's something greater than yourself here so he allowed a Ministry to come by your way to turn your attention and the reason why your attention has been turned is because there is a prophetic ministry under the ministry of Malachi 4 that has literally turned your hearts you see you see those men had been studying out the scriptures brother M would say it like this he said they was over there studying out the Book of Daniel he said they was over there reading he said and they was reading about the the how that how that Daniel said that there would be a rock that would be cut out of a stone in a Wilderness he said as he said that he said all of a sudden they saw a stranger in the sky and they saw that stranger up there now I maybe I'll just paint it for you just like this you see they saw William brandom as a stranger amongst the ministry but you and I recognize that it was more than just a man this is more than just a hillbilly Kian that turned our hearts back to what Paul preached but there was literally a supernatural light that would literally turn us this star passed every church this star passed every Observatory but they didn't see it but there was some Hallelujah there was some Believers that had been studying out the scripture and when they saw the star the Bible said they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy they'd been waiting for it they had looked at all their papers they had looked at all their blueprints they had study out the sky and they didn't have anything there that could point to them that this was something but something had come together because of false prophet I testified in numbers 24 that a star would rise and these men I wouldn't say lucky these men were blessed these men were predestinated you weren't lucky to come to this message you weren't lucky just to be born in the right family you were predestinated Hallelujah back to you the headship is here to lead you the headship is not going to take you it's not going to take you somewhere he's not going to allow his body to go somewhere that he's not willing for it to go but the headship is leading you because the headship is Christ and brother random would say in the five identifications of Jesus Christ he said who set this up he said who set up this mystical body he said none other than Jesus Christ he said but when did he set it up he set it up on the day of Pentecost you see this kingship that you under it's unlike any other king because Kings of this world are governed they're governed and they have intermediaries that literally tell them their Bishops say they begin to tell the king about this and they begin to tell the king about that and say well this should be done we should apply this tax we should apply this kind of blessing but this kingship that you are under ain't nobody telling King Jesus what to do when he decides to bless you they know nobody going to talk him out of it there ain't two other people up there trying to talk him out of your elect but he Hallelujah he's the kind of King that he wills and he reigns in his own heart let me put it in a different in a different aspect like this so that maybe you'll catch the attention of it it's like a great Orchestra and that Orchestra they are well trained and they are only paying attention to one person they ain't paying attention to the player beside them they ain't paying attention to the critics out there they're sitting out there getting ready to write a magazine they are not paying attention to the people that think they're better than you them people are only paying attention to one person and they're paying attention to that conductor it doesn't matter what the conductor does it doesn't matter how the conductor feels it doesn't matter what the conductor sees the conductor's already got it in position the condition is he's already thought of you before the foundation of the world and the Sheep music is in place so all you have to do is literally Hallelujah get under the harmony of the kingship so no preacher can talk you in it and no preacher can talk you out of it come on somebody and no critic can talk you in it and no critic can talk you out of it no sign can take it away from you no wonder can give it to you he is the king over every situation H Glory now David said it like this in Psalms 42 and7 deep calls to deep at the noise of thy water spouts I love how brother Brandon would say it like this he said now he said before there could be a fin on the fish's back it had to be some water for him to swim in you see you may not realize it but any any of these mothers that went through motherhood you may not even had a a a a positive pregnancy test but you begin to recognize something was different about you you begin to you begin to eat things you wouldn't typically eat peanut butter on a pickle you start you start acting different you start carrying yourself different you ain't got nothing new yet you don't even you don't even know nothing's changed but something is changing what is it there's something there's something on the inside of you that's that's literally changing you like it's like that boy brother brand talk about is funny it's like that boy brother man will talk about that boy that he was lacking he was lacking that uh sulfur in his body so he started eating that rubber eating rubber off him uh bicycles and so you see there was something lacking there and you see you see it was something that was working on him that he couldn't physically see and these wise men they couldn't even realize that before that star got into existence there was something in them that would give them the ability to be able to see and Jesus said except you be born again you cannot understand you cannot see the kingdom of God and the reason why your natural birth cannot comprehend this message is because this is not comprehended by a natural natural state but you have to be born again this is more than a Reformation this is more than just a halfway house here this is more than you just coming here and get rid of your getting rid of your habits and getting rid of your trials and getting rid of your addictions this is about getting transformed let me tell you something I if if we do nothing else here but get you born again I have done my job I don't care if I ever ever get the chance to ever see you speak in tongues brother brother Jonathan but if I can lead you to a born again experience I have done my job in the ministry if I can set up your heart for the King of Kings come on somebody we're not teaching you how to deal with your drug habits we're not teaching you how to deal with your pornography habits we're not teaching you how to get over this and get over that we are teaching you by by Bible Doctrine how to be Bible Sons and Daughters of God I'm not teaching your children how to deal with complexes and how to deal with stigmas I'm teaching them how to eradicate what good is sticking a devil over in the corner and going and being tempted by him every single day I say kill that devil eradicate that devil get rid of it [Applause] come on somebody God did not raise us up just to be streamers of the message God raised us up to be Christians that forsake not their assembling of themselves together and when you do that you are expressing the very thought of the king you see when a king is in his domain he can have full expression so let me say it to you like this the reason why the reason why the reason why he can express himself in Mark 16 that they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover is because there is somebody that is on the throne room of your heart come on some you would not believe that unless the King was there you would not believe you would not believe in a born- again experience unless a king said it but where the word of a king is there is power there is anointing there is an influence Glory I'm worked up I'm worked up man I am worked up cuz ain't nobody going to deny this King there was a lot of people that did not identify themselves with Ahab there was a lot of people that did not identify themselves with Trump and did not identify themselves with Biden bring it down to your level just for a minute but I Hallelujah no matter what no matter whether I'm a Believer I make believer or an unbeliever I cannot deny that Jesus is King because before this world is over every knee is going to Bow every tongue is going to [Applause] confess yet a little while and the world won't see me but you'll see me because I live you live the reason why you believe is because God deposited his kingship his domain his rule I'm worked up I'm worked up so let me ask you where is he where is he King of the Jews if I could be his voice just for a minute I'm right here I'm right here I'm in my word I'm in my bride I'm in my people where is he you're looking at him that's why William brandham could preach God's only provided place of worship I'm here you're not worshiping William brandham you're not worshiping Ron Spencer you're not worshiping Tim puit you are seeing the god of the Bible rule himself through his people somebody give God praise [Applause] Hallelujah where's he at he's here he's the same yesterday today and forever he eradicates fear he destroys Devils he torments the Tormentor he accuses the accuser Hallelujah I hope we have church tomorrow brother bam said it brother brand said in the great Shining Light here was Gentiles in the city of Jews crying where is he born King of the Jews now to me I could stop right there and eat on that one sentence here's Gentiles in the city of Jews crying where's he where's he King of the Jews in a city that should have recognized him amongst the church world that should have seen him amongst the denominations that should have been looking for him we've seen a star in the east and we've come to worship Him He said what a striking event of this day oh merciful father as we look and thank the Jews so asleep so asleep under Magi until Magi Eastern Gentiles had come from Far lands traveling to find the king of the Jews and they know nothing of it you look at it you look at it in this age three kings were in rign king of rock and roll Martin Luther King and King Jesus and they missed they missed the most important one their eyes were on the king of Music their eyes were on the king of of society and socialism but they miss the king of the world and that's why William brandham indicted this generation he said what a striking event I love that he said now he said today has God God has taken uneducated men that be me boys and girls who probably have no more than and a grammar school education he raised him up by the power of the Holy Ghost is crying in the ears of the church he's here in his great power to infold himself and to make known and the churches know nothing about it I love this he said they come to give homage they come to give honor to the King of Kings but they were not Kings but they were great enough to be honored guests of the king Hallelujah here they are sitting on the back of these stately animals as they go through the streets saying where is he at born King of the Jews the Bible said that all Jerusalem and Herod was troubled their testimony stirred something and we have church tomorrow I'm going to stir up something he said isn't it too bad today that the church can't arise out of its stupidity of theological exercises to see the power of the Living God resurrected Christ in his glory as an illiterate uneducated IND denominational movement striking at the world these wise men had a question and their question demanded an answer he was a kind of God that was going to meet the supply you see you look at the contrast har was worked up the the religious world was worked up but these Kings had a Hungry Heart to find them one was wanting to kill him one was wanting to worship Him you find the same thing today they're wanting to kill the move of the Holy Ghost but then there's some that are wanting to water it with a fresh Pentecostal drink because he's King you look at the contrast of it he he will supply Hallelujah I ain't went 30 minutes yet God bless you my brother maram said in question and answers and I I'm going to labor right here on this on this quote now don't get to count my don't begin to count my minutes here I hear you back here now wait a minute I'm like brother Ron my first 15 minutes don't count against me I got a timer up here so don't question me I'll tell you what it was after service God bless you hallelujah how many is here by a raise of hand are present we've got about four here everybody else I don't know what you are how many are here by show a hands are present okay praise God now brother Rand said in question answerers he said now watch now notice these wise men that's funny these wise men follow the star I'm going to take it back more of a minor way see the Wise Men followed his star asking where is he born King of the Jews he said you've heard that song we've seen his star in the east and have come to worship Him He said you heard that read it in the scripture he said all right Westward leading still proceeding God to thaty Perfect Light he said see the star was guiding to the perfect light because the star was only reflecting in light he said that's where we got this out here the other day see how many was here Sunday brother bam is referring back when he's he's ministering in in in uh on January the 8th of uh he's he's ministering on Revelations chapter 4 you can go back and listen to that series it's very powerful but brother R he goes in here he said now he said how many was here how many was here Sunday to see that he said see just got through preaching about it Shak Glory reflected in the star and the star reflects it he said here was the angel of the Lord standing here on the platform reflecting it back out there out of the shik glory it's just exactly the same he said there it was exactly looking here at the real one looking out there and it being reflected light on the side like that now notice that that star that the wise men were following where did he get his light from brother Bandon would tell us that that that star is only reflecting its light but you notice what the ability of that star was was to lead the ones that were following it to the word you see there's a lot of people that follow signs but those signs don't F lead you to the word you see you've got to watch you've got to watch false lights and true lights but how you find them out is how it leads you to the word now brother Brandon is drawing that out of Revelation Gans 4 and 5 and out of the throne proceeding Lightnings and thunderings and voices and there were seven lamps of fire burning Before the Throne which are the seven spirits of God he said God speaking to the church in the in the sermon he said God speaking to the church reflecting himself through the seven spirits when the true anointed of God speaks it's the voice of God he said to reject it is to move the Candlestick or to remove the Candlestick he said voices he said the voice of the seven Church ages over here in the corner the voice is speaking with thundering and lightning so to reject that voice is to move the candle stick or to remove the church age but to reflect it is to put it in its position he said if you have not received the light I'm trying to point you to one here not the one here at the pull pit because each and every one of us are a light is that right you are a city on a hill a candle on a hill set before a set before a city you see if you haven't received the light I'm trying to point you to one not one here at this Pulpit the one there at that throne and that Throne must be coming your heart then you'll see exactly the same thing that it's reflected here he said what is it up here it's reflecting this and this is the word you see you are representing a power you see when last weekend how many was here last weekend on Sunday you begin to watch a very Supernatural and special event you begin to watch brother Ron as you begin to operate operate under what was he he was not oper operating under his flesh he was operating under the headship and he begin to reflect he begin to reflect something only almighty God could do now that wasn't just for just for these two girls here but there were people on the other side of the United States that had been dealing with skin conditions when brother Ron rolled up his sleeves they were immediately got a touch from the Lord go ahead that's TR I go ahead and praise [Applause] him but where did brother Ron get that idea from he was representing a power you see Satan doesn't have to mind me but he has to mind the power that I represent so that's why it matters who you're reflecting you see this light that they were following had a power behind it it was leading them to the word and this message that you are following that is leading you will take you right to the word the reason why so many people don't believe in miracles is because there's not a there's not a king of the throne the reason why people believe that the supernatural isn't present is because he's not on the throne the reason why people don't believe in an outpouring of the Holy Ghost no more is because he's not on the throne but when a king is in his domain when a king is in his domain he said have faith in God that whosoever I love that he didn't say if a bishop says it he didn't say if a prophet says it he didn't say if a preacher says it but whosoever shall speak to this mountain be thou removed when you are expressing mark 22 through 24 you are expressing there is a king H what was it's so common to us it's so common to us I was listening to it the other day M brother Matthew I I I thought it so powerful brand was preaching on I have heard but now I see and he starts talking about Mark 11:22 24 brother say he starts talking about it it starts taking us through something that we hear over and over and over again he talks about what the third pool is and what the third pool does and a lot of people think well brother Ron's just simply telling those stories about that woman getting out of that wheelchair over again brother Ron's just simply telling that story about about laying hands laying hands on that woman over in Germany that was death that was death and she couldn't hear she could only hear by hearing eights and she come and handed it back to him I said well brother Ron's just telling stories because that happened in brother Ron's Ministry people hear brother brandham and and he that is in you start telling stories about a 42-inch caribou and start talking about Silver Tip gz Grizzly BL and they think brother brandom's just filling up time and there's a lot of people that sit right here in Services think well brother Ron's just just talking about his own self he's bringing up his own Ministry he's bringing up thing he's really trying to point things to himself you got to be an idiot forgive me that was associate pastor and Son all at the same time you think about it I must have got a hold of brother Matthew's notes again and you hear brother man starts talking about and he that is in you the big mats my mat I ain't read brother Matt Eminem's words just yet so brother Mar starts talking about then three squirrels and people like I done heard that a 100 times I'll tell you something it meant something real special to Sister Hattie it meant something real special to Sister Hattie it was more than a story to Sister Hade when she was sitting there and all of a sudden the king comes in the room and she says that ain't nothing but the truth she said ain't nothing but the truth it meant something more than just a story to Sister Hattie she could say I heard about it but now I see it Lily you heard about it but you getting ready to see it you heard about it you heard about it you heard about it it's more than a story I identify this to you that this is more than an if with King Jesus it is already doneall what is William BR doing he is expressing the kingship of Mark 11 that wasn't William Bram he said them things were sovereignly given so when the supernatural Falls in here is it brother Andrew or is it brother Ron or is it the king I identify that he is king of kings and he is Lord over this church Hallelujah when brother Tim proy walked into my daddy's Daddy's hospital room he' been laying there for 17 days 36 hours brother Steven laying there brain dead I identify that that was more than temp that walked in that room because my daddy was a dead man according to doctor standards but it was more than a story to me when a man that was operating under the kingship of Mark 11 whosoever shall speak to this mountain and he prayed the prayer over him I identify that that was more than a man that was praying that prayer that was a king in action Hallelujah I heard about it I heard about it I heard about a God that delivered from drug problems I heard about a God that gives the Holy Ghost a lot of you know I was a rascal but from that time I met King Jesus I heard about it it was more than a story it was more than squirrels it was more than a 42inch caribou it was more than a silver tip grizzly bear I met him I handled him I touched him I want to say this to you he is more he is more than just words on a page he is more than just a dead letter this is more than just a church you've been coming here for 20 30 40 years 5 years 10 years one year 6 months identify this this is not just a church building this is a living breathing Oracle of almighty God where we express Miracles we express healings we express Divine super intervention from almighty God we give the Holy Ghost by the unction of the king we pardon sins by the blood of Jesus Christ we water baptize and raise up Christians let's stand let me have sister Stephanie Isaiah chapter 9 and verse 6 For unto us unto us a child is born unto us a
