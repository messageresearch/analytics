[1:02:00] for you my god
[1:02:06] lord jesus there is no god
[1:02:10] like jehovah lord we have already felt
[1:02:15] your presence lord as you were stirring
[1:02:18] the water as it were
[1:02:20] as we begin to step into the atmosphere
[1:02:24] of an awesome god lord you begin to
[1:02:28] quickly
[1:02:29] allow us to recognize that you are here
[1:02:32] in this building
[1:02:34] and you are willing to do exceedingly
[1:02:37] abundantly above
[1:02:38] all that we could ask or think
[1:02:41] lord when we begin to think about that
[1:02:44] that just one time in your presence it
[1:02:47] changes
[1:02:48] every situation that that the angel of
[1:02:51] the lord makes the difference
[1:02:54] in this service in this in this moment
[1:02:56] in this time
[1:02:57] we begin to think about how powerful you
[1:03:00] are all of our problems begin to fade
[1:03:03] away and
[1:03:04] become so small or when we begin to
[1:03:06] reflect and think about
[1:03:08] the almighty power of god
[1:03:12] that has never diminished lord i pray
[1:03:15] tonight that you would move across this
[1:03:16] congregate
[1:03:18] here and by the way of the internet
[1:03:20] whoever may be listening father
[1:03:23] lord i pray that you would discern the
[1:03:25] thoughts and the intents of the heart
[1:03:28] i pray that you would extend through the
[1:03:30] airways father
[1:03:31] and lord may we just tap into the
[1:03:33] channel of the holy spirit father and
[1:03:36] may you begin to move with compassion
[1:03:38] upon your people
[1:03:40] now you move in a very special way
[1:03:42] father
[1:03:43] we would say that that did not our
[1:03:46] hearts burn within us as he talked to us
[1:03:48] along the way
[1:03:50] god i pray that you'd move like only you
[1:03:54] could move
[1:03:55] in jesus name amen
[1:03:59] if you have your bibles this evening
[1:04:00] we'll turn over in the book of hebrews
[1:04:02] chapter 13
[1:04:04] and verse 8.
[1:04:14] hallelujah
[1:04:18] hebrews chapter 13 and verse 8.
[1:04:26] i'd like to speak to you tonight on he's
[1:04:28] still jesus
[1:04:31] he's still jesus
[1:04:35] i think we could all quote it my heart
[1:04:39] let's just read it together jesus christ
[1:04:43] the same yesterday and today and forever
[1:04:47] may god bless his word you may be seated
[1:04:49] this evening in the presence of the lord
[1:04:52] that word same is a very powerful word
[1:04:56] and to think about that that this god
[1:04:59] that we speak
[1:05:00] of that that jesus christ is identical
[1:05:03] yesterday as he is today and he will be
[1:05:07] exactly the same he's not changing he's
[1:05:09] not
[1:05:10] he's not he's not having to be changed
[1:05:12] he's the same
[1:05:14] and brother branham would refer to this
[1:05:16] this one scripture
[1:05:18] of hebrews 13 8 that jesus christ is the
[1:05:20] same yesterday today
[1:05:22] and forever over 3 100 times
[1:05:25] it would be the theme of this message
[1:05:27] that jesus christ is the same yesterday
[1:05:30] today and forever and to think about all
[1:05:33] the things that are going on in the
[1:05:35] world today when this world is in
[1:05:37] absolute disarray when it seems so
[1:05:39] discombobulated
[1:05:41] when it seems like it's about to spin
[1:05:42] off of its axis
[1:05:44] but yet jesus is still the same and here
[1:05:47] our prophet would come and he would
[1:05:49] spread
[1:05:49] he would speak to us a world that has
[1:05:51] fallen apart
[1:05:52] but yet god's not falling apart when we
[1:05:55] see a shift of powers in the demonic
[1:05:58] realm and government's realm and
[1:06:00] and you see that truly that lay odyssey
[1:06:02] is absolutely at work
[1:06:04] and that change is always happening and
[1:06:06] you can look around in in our in our
[1:06:09] in our area and see the beauty of this
[1:06:11] color
[1:06:12] that god has painted across these
[1:06:14] mountains and you see that seasons are
[1:06:17] changing it's telling
[1:06:18] us that that winter's just at hand we
[1:06:21] we buried our precious sister today
[1:06:23] sister irene it tells us that life
[1:06:26] is always changing but there's one thing
[1:06:29] that always remains the same and that is
[1:06:32] jesus he is god and there is
[1:06:35] no god but jesus there's not a third
[1:06:38] person there's not a second person
[1:06:40] he is jesus and it's not a he's not a
[1:06:44] mythical god he's not an imaginary
[1:06:46] god that is setting that is setting out
[1:06:48] there but he's a living god and it's
[1:06:50] what is that living god it's the word in
[1:06:53] you making
[1:06:54] itself real and no believer of this word
[1:06:58] will ever place god's word back
[1:07:00] somewhere in the past
[1:07:02] they will never make this god a weakling
[1:07:04] or a historian god
[1:07:06] yes he's a god of history of course but
[1:07:08] he's he's a shame because the bible said
[1:07:11] that he's the same
[1:07:12] when you take up this bible you are
[1:07:14] taking up the literal
[1:07:16] word of our lord jesus christ you are
[1:07:19] holding god
[1:07:20] in bible form that he's the same
[1:07:23] yesterday today and forever and
[1:07:25] a real believer's not going to put him
[1:07:27] back there in the past somewhere
[1:07:29] you because you see he cannot lose his
[1:07:31] power and he's not
[1:07:33] changing he's still jesus
[1:07:38] he's still jesus now the bible said in
[1:07:40] matthew 4 and 23 that
[1:07:43] and jesus went about all galilee
[1:07:45] teaching in their synagogues and
[1:07:47] and preaching the gospel of the kingdom
[1:07:49] and healing
[1:07:50] all manner of sickness and all manner of
[1:07:52] disease among the people
[1:07:54] and his fame went throughout all syria
[1:07:57] and they brought unto him all sick
[1:07:59] people that were taken with diverse
[1:08:02] diseases and torments
[1:08:04] and those which were possessed with
[1:08:06] devils and those which were lunatic
[1:08:08] and those that had palsy and he healed
[1:08:11] them
[1:08:13] he's still jesus today i want you to
[1:08:16] know you can take every one of your
[1:08:18] infirmities you can take every one of
[1:08:19] your loved ones needs and i want to tell
[1:08:21] you that he's still
[1:08:22] jesus that if they could bring things to
[1:08:26] him in that day with
[1:08:27] hard hard circumstances heart diseases
[1:08:31] hard situations
[1:08:32] but there were a people that believed
[1:08:35] that he was the messiah
[1:08:37] and he healed them because he was jesus
[1:08:42] and now now if jesus is and god forgive
[1:08:45] me for saying
[1:08:46] if i don't mean to be and i don't mean
[1:08:48] to be sacrilegious but to make a point
[1:08:50] that if jesus christ is the same
[1:08:52] yesterday today and forever
[1:08:54] and we have the same desire then why
[1:08:57] can't we see him
[1:08:58] if he's still the same is there anybody
[1:09:01] here that would like to see
[1:09:03] jesus tonight now he has to be the same
[1:09:07] if the bible says he's the same is that
[1:09:10] right
[1:09:11] and he's the same savior he's the same
[1:09:14] healer
[1:09:14] and he's just the same as he was the
[1:09:16] only thing different about him
[1:09:19] he's now he's now an invisible body
[1:09:22] there where he was in a visible body but
[1:09:24] he's promised that a little while
[1:09:26] and the world won't see me but yet
[1:09:28] you'll see me
[1:09:30] i will be with you even in you to the
[1:09:33] consummation
[1:09:34] of the h that he would be with you into
[1:09:37] the end of the world
[1:09:39] his first commandment i am the lord and
[1:09:41] there is no god like me
[1:09:43] i am god and i change not so if jesus of
[1:09:47] the bible healed then
[1:09:49] then jesus of today heals now
[1:09:52] if jesus of the bible delivered then he
[1:09:55] delivers now
[1:09:56] if jesus of the bible does save then he
[1:09:59] has to save now if jesus of the bible
[1:10:03] filled with the holy ghost sin
[1:10:05] he's got to fill with the holy ghost now
[1:10:08] are you with me why then why in the
[1:10:11] world would we allow
[1:10:12] satan to stack up in our mind that we
[1:10:14] can't have all that he's promised to us
[1:10:18] but the bible says to us in romans 8 and
[1:10:21] 31 that what shall we say to these
[1:10:23] things
[1:10:23] that if god be for us who can be against
[1:10:26] us
[1:10:27] who can be against us if jesus is still
[1:10:30] jesus
[1:10:31] who can be against us how can we not
[1:10:34] have
[1:10:34] all of these things that he's promised
[1:10:36] us if jesus is still jesus
[1:10:40] is there anything too hard for the lord
[1:10:43] and he's that spared not his own son but
[1:10:46] delivered him up for us
[1:10:48] now how shall he not freely give us all
[1:10:50] things
[1:10:52] the bible tells us he'll give us freely
[1:10:54] all things then why shouldn't we have it
[1:10:57] if he's still jesus then why can't we
[1:11:00] believe that he's still jesus
[1:11:03] if he healed the lunatics then then why
[1:11:06] can't the jesus of the day
[1:11:08] heal the lunatics of today are you with
[1:11:11] me if jesus of the bible
[1:11:13] when they would bring hard cases to him
[1:11:16] and he would move with compassion
[1:11:18] and he would heal their sickness why
[1:11:20] can't he do it today
[1:11:22] i think that's a great question if he's
[1:11:25] still jesus
[1:11:26] then why can't he do the same thing that
[1:11:28] he did then if he's still the same
[1:11:30] yesterday today and forever
[1:11:32] you remember when when the disciples in
[1:11:35] john chapter 9
[1:11:36] when the disciples when they were
[1:11:37] walking with jesus
[1:11:39] and they asked him when they seen the
[1:11:41] blind man that was sitting there
[1:11:42] they asked him who did sin his parents
[1:11:46] or himself and jesus answered them
[1:11:49] neither himself nor his parents but that
[1:11:52] the work
[1:11:53] and that the glory of the lord would be
[1:11:55] made manifest in him
[1:11:57] and jesus said that i must work the work
[1:12:01] of him
[1:12:02] that sent me that while it is day
[1:12:05] while it is day the night cometh when no
[1:12:07] man can work
[1:12:08] and as long as i am in the world i am
[1:12:11] the light of the world
[1:12:13] now the thing about this is that that
[1:12:15] that there were people on the earth
[1:12:18] in that day that were the so-called
[1:12:20] message believers of the day that
[1:12:22] believed every jot and tittle that they
[1:12:24] were lining it up in every way possible
[1:12:27] and those priests had to know they had
[1:12:29] to know
[1:12:30] all the the scrolls in certain ways that
[1:12:33] when they would roll
[1:12:34] up that scroll they had to be able to
[1:12:36] stick a pen
[1:12:37] through that scroll and tell you exactly
[1:12:40] what that pen was going through
[1:12:42] but here they had read all of these
[1:12:44] things they read about moses
[1:12:45] they read about elijah but here the man
[1:12:48] jesus was getting ready to do something
[1:12:51] so unorthodox to what they read
[1:12:54] here jesus goes to preaching that this
[1:12:57] was
[1:12:57] to do because of the work of the lord
[1:13:00] that it would be manifest in him
[1:13:02] and jesus had been preaching so much
[1:13:05] that jesus began to spit on the ground
[1:13:10] you see well some people get all excited
[1:13:12] we'll say man i've seen the preacher all
[1:13:13] slobber and everything you better just
[1:13:15] watch out
[1:13:15] he may use that spittle to put it in
[1:13:17] your eyes and bring eyesight to yourself
[1:13:20] because that's what jesus was doing he's
[1:13:22] sitting there preaching
[1:13:23] and all of a sudden something moves on
[1:13:26] him
[1:13:26] and jesus takes this spittle he gets
[1:13:30] down in the dirt
[1:13:31] and he starts taking that spittle and he
[1:13:33] makes clay out of that spill
[1:13:36] and he takes and he starts rubbing it
[1:13:38] together and he starts making himself
[1:13:40] some mud cakes
[1:13:41] how many children ever made some mud
[1:13:43] cakes back in the day
[1:13:45] how many still make them today well here
[1:13:48] jesus
[1:13:48] is making some mud cakes and all of a
[1:13:50] sudden he takes the mud case
[1:13:52] and he rubs it on the blind man's eyes
[1:13:55] and he tells a blind man to go by the
[1:13:57] pool of shalom which means sin and go
[1:14:00] down and wash your eyes
[1:14:02] now notice what he did he went
[1:14:05] and he did everything that jesus told
[1:14:08] him to do
[1:14:10] and when the blind man comes back here
[1:14:13] he is the people
[1:14:14] and the neighbors that once knew him
[1:14:15] begin to talk now
[1:14:17] is that the man that sat there and
[1:14:18] begged and they were questioning whether
[1:14:21] he was him or whether he was not
[1:14:22] but here all of a sudden the blind man
[1:14:24] speaks up i am he
[1:14:28] you see because he had recognized that
[1:14:30] they were talking about somebody
[1:14:32] that once was blind but he was getting
[1:14:34] ready to tell them that i am no longer
[1:14:36] blind
[1:14:37] i used to sit in that condition but
[1:14:39] jesus came by my way
[1:14:43] he came by my way now look the bible
[1:14:45] said that they marveled at this they
[1:14:47] didn't marvel because of the mud
[1:14:49] they didn't marvel because of spit but
[1:14:50] they marveled because he
[1:14:52] obeyed what jesus told him to do
[1:14:57] it's a hard thing sometimes to believe
[1:15:00] what jesus is telling you to do he might
[1:15:02] ask you in an unorthodox way of
[1:15:05] that you need to do this or do that but
[1:15:07] if jesus said it
[1:15:08] and you believe it and you act upon what
[1:15:10] he said
[1:15:11] it may be unorthodox it may seem funny
[1:15:14] to the outside realm
[1:15:16] but i'm telling you if you believe and
[1:15:18] act upon his promises
[1:15:20] the results that will come will be a
[1:15:22] blessing to your life
[1:15:24] there'll be a blessing to your life in
[1:15:26] such a way
[1:15:29] that i could say today that he's still
[1:15:31] jesus
[1:15:34] now remember now and brother branham
[1:15:37] dealing in a prayer line he said now
[1:15:39] remember we're dealing with blind
[1:15:40] spirits
[1:15:41] that when they come out of one they they
[1:15:43] try to go to another so that
[1:15:45] just so just that you might know keep
[1:15:48] your head bowed
[1:15:49] this is important that you let your
[1:15:51] children listen just now
[1:15:53] so just that you might know keep your
[1:15:55] head bowed until you ask
[1:15:57] till you're asked to look up for it
[1:15:59] might be a few days from now
[1:16:01] you might not have sight but wait till
[1:16:03] you hear me say raise your head
[1:16:05] because when you look the eye is the
[1:16:07] gate of the soul
[1:16:08] well you say well brother branham that's
[1:16:09] psychology he said if it is
[1:16:12] then jesus used it he took a blind man
[1:16:15] and led him away from the crowd and took
[1:16:17] him outside of the city and prayed for
[1:16:19] him get him away from the crowd now pray
[1:16:22] and when he went to raise jairus
[1:16:24] daughter he put everybody outside of the
[1:16:26] house
[1:16:27] and he's still jesus tonight whether the
[1:16:30] woman will be able to see i don't know
[1:16:32] she's standing here totally blind in
[1:16:34] darkness now have faith in god and
[1:16:36] believe while i pray for her please
[1:16:38] now sister now now keep your head bowed
[1:16:41] and let the lids of your
[1:16:43] ovary let the lids over your eye over
[1:16:45] your blind eyes be closed while i ask
[1:16:47] our lord jesus believe that he's going
[1:16:50] to break forth
[1:16:52] and shrink up those demons in here that
[1:16:54] you'll be able to see your father
[1:16:56] dear as i stand by a blind woman one
[1:17:00] set along the highway begging and then
[1:17:02] jesus came along
[1:17:04] oh come near lord there might have been
[1:17:07] there might have been many there that
[1:17:09] had faith i don't know i wasn't there
[1:17:10] lord
[1:17:11] but i know you met and gave blind
[1:17:13] bartimaeus aside
[1:17:15] and when he's when he could see i
[1:17:17] believe that he tried to follow you
[1:17:19] he said this poor this poor little
[1:17:21] mother standing here she's blind
[1:17:23] lord you know her i'm just a man i've
[1:17:25] tried to represent you
[1:17:27] push back the blackness for her will you
[1:17:30] lord break forth sight in those blind
[1:17:33] eyes
[1:17:34] we don't ask for miracles lord but just
[1:17:36] something to encourage
[1:17:38] that would make her know that you're the
[1:17:40] son of god and i'll be your servant
[1:17:43] lord to tell them the truth i believe if
[1:17:46] you'll do it lord everyone in here would
[1:17:48] accept you right then
[1:17:49] please do now will you hear my prayer as
[1:17:53] i ask you with all of my heart in jesus
[1:17:55] name
[1:17:56] now satan this duel of faith you claim
[1:17:59] her
[1:18:00] and i claim her for jesus i claim you
[1:18:03] have no power over her
[1:18:04] i claim you have no power over nothing
[1:18:07] jesus christ my lord stripped you and
[1:18:09] robbed you of everything that you had
[1:18:12] and every legal rights at calvary i
[1:18:14] stand here as his representative
[1:18:17] and you know he's on the platform
[1:18:21] and you know he's on the platform you
[1:18:24] know all about this gift
[1:18:26] satan knew where he was at that he was
[1:18:29] getting
[1:18:30] ready to lose the battle
[1:18:33] the angel was at the platform
[1:18:36] the ministry of the son of man was at
[1:18:39] the platform
[1:18:40] you know about where he ministered and
[1:18:42] how he did it
[1:18:44] and i charge thee by the living god that
[1:18:47] you
[1:18:47] come out of that woman and leave her in
[1:18:49] jesus christ's name
[1:18:51] every head bowed let me see your eyes
[1:18:54] first i will call you
[1:18:56] speaking to the audience i'll call you
[1:18:58] if something happens now just raise your
[1:19:00] head can you see me
[1:19:02] put your hands on my nose amen
[1:19:05] open your eyes the woman can see she's
[1:19:07] got her sight
[1:19:10] it was a blind spirit that was holding
[1:19:12] her bound
[1:19:14] brother branham would say now he said
[1:19:16] now maybe if you had a band on your arm
[1:19:19] that was that was cutting off the
[1:19:20] circulation he said that's how that
[1:19:23] spirit goes in there
[1:19:24] and it cuts off the circulation so that
[1:19:27] your optical nerve can't work to its
[1:19:29] right ability
[1:19:30] and what faith does is faith cuts that
[1:19:33] band
[1:19:35] and what you were watching was when the
[1:19:38] angel
[1:19:39] began to move close to that blind spirit
[1:19:43] that that blind spirit had to take its
[1:19:45] leave because it recognized
[1:19:47] that this was still jesus
[1:19:51] i want to say to you church that if you
[1:19:53] could ever get in his presence one time
[1:19:56] the demons that haunt you your fears
[1:19:59] that haunt you
[1:20:00] the depression that haunts you the
[1:20:02] afflictions that haunt you
[1:20:04] all of the sickness that afflicts you
[1:20:06] and haunts you
[1:20:08] those demons will recognize that he's
[1:20:11] still
[1:20:11] jesus you may not believe it the
[1:20:15] politics of the world may not believe it
[1:20:18] but he's still jesus
[1:20:23] oh hallelujah i want you to know that
[1:20:25] cancer is a real believer in jesus
[1:20:28] depression's a real believer in jesus
[1:20:31] because they know that when jesus
[1:20:33] shows up they get kicked out and i say
[1:20:37] to you
[1:20:37] in the name of the lord he's still jesus
[1:20:44] you see satan was trying to rob her of
[1:20:46] what was rightfully hers
[1:20:48] and shape will try to rob you from your
[1:20:50] inheritance he'll try to cheat you from
[1:20:52] your inheritance
[1:20:53] but i want to tell you that god ain't
[1:20:55] changed his mind about you
[1:20:57] and he ain't changed his mind about his
[1:20:58] word
[1:21:01] confirmation of the commission he said
[1:21:03] i've heard people say that this was a
[1:21:04] bunch of crazy people
[1:21:07] i've heard the same thing said about you
[1:21:10] i had people tell me that when i
[1:21:11] received the holy ghost that i lost my
[1:21:13] mind well
[1:21:14] whether that's right or not i don't know
[1:21:16] but there's one thing i do know
[1:21:19] wherein i once was a sinner but now i'm
[1:21:21] saved
[1:21:22] and wherein i once was lost but now i'm
[1:21:25] found
[1:21:26] you can call it fanaticism whatever you
[1:21:28] want to
[1:21:29] but it's a confirmation to me that he
[1:21:31] still jesus christ
[1:21:33] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:21:38] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:21:41] if they were preaching jesus in acts
[1:21:44] chapter 2
[1:21:44] and all of a sudden the holy ghost came
[1:21:47] down and all of a sudden the holy ghost
[1:21:49] went to act
[1:21:50] and what were they doing they were
[1:21:52] preaching in jesus name
[1:21:53] miracles were in jesus name if he's
[1:21:56] still
[1:21:57] jesus tonight then why can't we have a
[1:21:59] miracle in this place
[1:22:01] why can't we have diseases cast out if
[1:22:04] he's still
[1:22:05] jesus if the angel of the covenant
[1:22:09] is still behind this message then why
[1:22:12] can't we expect a body change
[1:22:16] whoa hallelujah the bible said in acts
[1:22:19] 19 11
[1:22:21] that they took cloths napkins off of
[1:22:24] paul's body
[1:22:25] and the bible said that special miracles
[1:22:28] were done
[1:22:29] we've seen supernatural things happen
[1:22:32] by prayer cloths being laid on people
[1:22:36] i can hear a prophet say now now i'm not
[1:22:38] saint paul
[1:22:39] but he's still jesus i've heard of
[1:22:42] people that
[1:22:43] they would take a prayer cloth much like
[1:22:45] i carry tonight here
[1:22:48] one that brother william branham prayed
[1:22:50] over and there were people that were
[1:22:52] dealing with ulcers and dealing with
[1:22:54] tumors
[1:22:54] and they were watching as a preacher was
[1:22:57] preaching with that prayer cloth
[1:22:59] and they said and then they watched a
[1:23:01] strand fall off of it
[1:23:03] and that preacher would take that strand
[1:23:04] and he would lay it there
[1:23:06] and that woman that was dealing with
[1:23:07] tumors she came up and said
[1:23:09] can i can i have that strand
[1:23:12] can i have that strand and she was
[1:23:14] dealing with all of these things on the
[1:23:16] inside of her stomach
[1:23:17] and when she by faith took that she said
[1:23:20] i would do more than just lay it on my
[1:23:22] body she stuck it in her mouth and
[1:23:24] swallowed it
[1:23:25] and within a very few days all of those
[1:23:27] things were completely gone
[1:23:31] it ain't the napkin it's he steal jesus
[1:23:36] oh hallelujah
[1:23:39] hallelujah when when peter was walking
[1:23:42] down the street there were people
[1:23:44] that were saying lay me out in the
[1:23:46] street so that his shadow
[1:23:48] can pass over me and when peter's shadow
[1:23:50] would pass over him
[1:23:51] they would be completely whole what was
[1:23:54] it
[1:23:54] it was who peter was preaching
[1:23:58] it wasn't peter it wasn't the man it was
[1:24:00] jesus in the man
[1:24:06] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:24:09] are not we his children tonight
[1:24:13] are we not as children are we not
[1:24:16] believers of this message
[1:24:18] it was the angel that vindicated the
[1:24:20] message
[1:24:21] it was not william branham himself he
[1:24:23] said i'm just standing close when he
[1:24:25] comes
[1:24:27] hallelujah i've been there in brother
[1:24:30] and brother ron spencer's ministry and
[1:24:32] seen
[1:24:32] as the angel the lord would come and do
[1:24:34] supernatural things
[1:24:36] hey i was quick to recognize that my
[1:24:39] daddy did not have the ability
[1:24:41] with only in his own humanistic
[1:24:43] standpoint to reveal those things
[1:24:46] but i watched as the angel of the lord
[1:24:47] begin to move
[1:24:49] i've watched it when men that would come
[1:24:51] evangelists would come and stand behind
[1:24:53] this pulpit
[1:24:54] and they would read the very secrets of
[1:24:57] the heart
[1:24:58] i recognize real quick that he's still
[1:25:01] jesus
[1:25:03] i hope you don't get tired of my title
[1:25:05] tonight because i want you to know if
[1:25:06] you leave here and you don't know this
[1:25:08] one thing know this
[1:25:09] he's still jesus look at your neighbor
[1:25:12] elbow your neighbor elbow your family
[1:25:14] member say hey
[1:25:15] wake up he's still jesus
[1:25:20] hallelujah for jesus said as he's
[1:25:23] closing out
[1:25:24] the hours of his ministry right before
[1:25:27] his ascension
[1:25:28] in mark 16 he said he that believeth
[1:25:32] and is baptized shall be saved but he

[1:28:03] you see because if god speaks to you and
[1:28:06] he sends you
[1:28:08] how many are your children are you
[1:28:10] children of the king tonight
[1:28:12] so if god speaks to you and send you he
[1:28:15] backs up what you say
[1:28:17] if you're an ambassador from heaven all
[1:28:19] of heaven is behind you
[1:28:21] and heaven is consistent of the word

[1:28:56] behind me
[1:28:57] hell can't be against me because heaven
[1:29:00] is for me
[1:29:04] i'm just crazy enough to believe it
[1:29:06] because he's still jesus
[1:29:10] now look the bible didn't say these
[1:29:12] signs will follow william branham
[1:29:14] he didn't say it would follow oral
[1:29:15] robbers only he didn't say it would
[1:29:17] follow brother cop or somebody
[1:29:20] these signs shall follow them plural
[1:29:23] that believe if they lay their hands on
[1:29:27] the sick
[1:29:28] and they shall recover
[1:29:32] it's the power of god that's in you that
[1:29:35] brings the life to the person
[1:29:37] that you got your hand on the
[1:29:39] life-giving source
[1:29:41] of the holy ghost
[1:29:46] you can stay there if you want
[1:29:51] but there's going to be how would you
[1:29:52] say three or four
[1:29:54] black eyes for him tonight
[1:29:58] he's got more ice than i got brother
[1:30:02] nate said give him three or four black
[1:30:03] eyes
[1:30:04] he must get back up again so if he's
[1:30:07] going to try to get back up so why
[1:30:08] shouldn't we just preach to him a little
[1:30:10] bit
[1:30:11] why shouldn't we just go ahead and tell
[1:30:13] him why we believe
[1:30:15] and who we believe that he's still jesus
[1:30:19] he's still the almighty he's still the
[1:30:22] god of abraham the god of isaac and the
[1:30:25] god of jacob
[1:30:26] and we are abraham's seed being dead in
[1:30:29] christ and we take on abraham's seed
[1:30:31] and our heirs according to the promise
[1:30:33] why shouldn't we believe
[1:30:35] the supernatural
[1:30:39] why shouldn't we believe that
[1:30:42] but tg i'm doing this everything that's
[1:30:45] everlasting
[1:30:46] everything that's real is uncertain
[1:30:49] unscientifically proved
[1:30:50] the whole armor of god is completely
[1:30:53] supernatural
[1:30:54] love joy peace long suffering goodness
[1:30:56] meekness gentleness
[1:30:58] patience faith every armor the whole
[1:31:01] army of christianity
[1:31:03] is supernatural then why shouldn't we
[1:31:05] believe
[1:31:06] in supernatural things if the entire
[1:31:09] army of the christian faith is
[1:31:11] supernatural
[1:31:12] we look at the unseen and not
[1:31:16] what we see so why shouldn't we believe
[1:31:21] when jesus is standing there in matthew
[1:31:23] 17 and 20
[1:31:24] he said because of your unbelief verily
[1:31:26] i say unto you
[1:31:28] that if you have faith as a grain of
[1:31:31] mustard seed he's not talking about the
[1:31:33] size
[1:31:33] of it it's one of the smallest seeds but
[1:31:37] jesus
[1:31:38] is not talking about the size of the
[1:31:40] seed
[1:31:41] he's talking about the power of that
[1:31:43] seed that that mustard seed can't be
[1:31:46] mixed
[1:31:47] i say unto you that if you have faith as
[1:31:50] a grain of mustard seed
[1:31:51] you shall say unto this mountain
[1:31:55] that means had a mountain in their life
[1:31:59] that if you shall say unto this mountain
[1:32:02] remove hence the underplace and
[1:32:05] it shall remove and nothing shall be
[1:32:09] impossible
[1:32:10] unto you hallelujah
[1:32:14] he's still jesus and you're still you
[1:32:18] brother denny
[1:32:20] he's still jesus and if he's still jesus
[1:32:24] then why shouldn't we ask
[1:32:26] because jesus said in matthew 7 and 7
[1:32:29] ask and it shall be given you why
[1:32:32] shouldn't we ask if he told us to
[1:32:35] why shouldn't we asking it shall be
[1:32:38] given to you
[1:32:39] why shouldn't we seek because he said if
[1:32:41] you seek you shall find me
[1:32:43] knock and it shall be opened unto me
[1:32:46] why shouldn't we do these things
[1:32:50] why shouldn't we do these things for
[1:32:52] everyone that asketh
[1:32:53] receiveth why shouldn't you ask if you
[1:32:56] know you're going to get it
[1:32:59] hey what a great program thank you jesus
[1:33:03] and he that seeketh findeth and he that
[1:33:06] knocketh
[1:33:07] it shall be opened unto you
[1:33:10] why shouldn't we ask if we know we're
[1:33:12] gonna get
[1:33:14] why shouldn't we give if jesus is still
[1:33:16] jesus then why shouldn't we give our
[1:33:18] tithe unto the lord
[1:33:20] if jesus can still pour out a blessing
[1:33:23] if jesus can take your ten percent and
[1:33:26] do a whole lot better with it
[1:33:28] than you can do with your 100 percent
[1:33:30] then why shouldn't we give to jesus
[1:33:35] he said give and it shall be given unto
[1:33:37] you good measure pressed down shaken
[1:33:39] together
[1:33:40] running over and shall give men under
[1:33:42] your bosom
[1:33:44] why shouldn't we give when jesus said
[1:33:46] it's more blessed to give
[1:33:48] than it is to receive if he's still
[1:33:52] jesus
[1:33:52] then why shouldn't we confess
[1:33:56] why shouldn't we when the bible tells us
[1:33:58] in first john 4
[1:33:59] 15 that whosoever shall confess that
[1:34:02] jesus
[1:34:03] is the son of god god dwelleth in him
[1:34:06] and he and god
[1:34:07] why shouldn't we confess when paul tells
[1:34:10] us in hebrews 4 and 14
[1:34:12] seeing then that we have a great high
[1:34:14] priest that is passed in the heavens
[1:34:16] jesus the son of god let us hold fast
[1:34:20] our profession why
[1:34:23] shouldn't we confess
[1:34:27] if jesus is still jesus and his word is
[1:34:30] as good as it was 2 000 years ago and he
[1:34:34] ain't lost his power
[1:34:35] then why shouldn't we confess his name
[1:34:38] before all men
[1:34:40] if he's still jesus then why should we
[1:34:44] not
[1:34:44] be confident in his promise for the
[1:34:47] bible said in proverbs 3 and 26
[1:34:50] for the lord shall be thy confidence
[1:34:53] it ain't in yourself it's in him
[1:34:57] for the lord shall be thy confidence and
[1:34:59] shall keep thy foot from being taken
[1:35:03] if he's still jesus then why shouldn't
[1:35:05] we be courageous
[1:35:08] when the bible says in deuteronomy 31
[1:35:10] and 6
[1:35:11] be strong and of a good courage and fear
[1:35:14] not nor be afraid of them
[1:35:15] for the lord thy god he it is that doth
[1:35:18] go with thee
[1:35:19] he will not fail thee nor forsake thee
[1:35:22] and he told joshua in joshua 1 and 7
[1:35:25] only be thou strong and very courageous
[1:35:29] if he's still jesus then why can't we be
[1:35:32] courageous
[1:35:33] in 2020. when everybody else is becoming
[1:35:37] weaklings
[1:35:38] when everybody else is falling apart
[1:35:40] when everybody else is letting
[1:35:42] down the standard why shouldn't we have
[1:35:44] a little bit of courage about ourselves
[1:35:47] if jesus is still jesus and he said that
[1:35:50] i
[1:35:50] will give you an overcoming power i'll
[1:35:53] fill you with myself
[1:35:54] then why can't we be courageous tonight
[1:35:58] and stand in his promises
[1:36:04] if he's still jesus then why shouldn't
[1:36:06] we go to church
[1:36:11] i'm just going to stay and stream
[1:36:14] if jesus is still jesus and his bible's
[1:36:17] still the bible
[1:36:18] and his promises are still the promises
[1:36:21] if jesus said go to church
[1:36:23] i'm going to church if jesus said
[1:36:26] paint your hair everywhere but could
[1:36:29] what but gray
[1:36:30] if he would say blue i'd paint it blue
[1:36:32] if he said green i'd paint it green
[1:36:34] if he said red well i already got it
[1:36:38] but if he said it i believe it
[1:36:42] and if jesus said to forsake not the
[1:36:45] assembling of yourselves
[1:36:46] so much as you see the day approaching
[1:36:49] i'm going to be at church
[1:36:50] when the doors open as david said i was
[1:36:53] glad when they said unto me
[1:36:55] let us go to the house of the lord if
[1:36:57] jesus is still
[1:36:58] jesus and he said that he'd meet me
[1:37:01] where two or three are gathered in my
[1:37:02] name
[1:37:03] if jesus is still jesus i'm going to
[1:37:06] gather in his name
[1:37:07] i'm going to worship in his name i'm
[1:37:10] going to praise in his name
[1:37:11] i'm going to shout in his name and i'm
[1:37:14] going to dance in his name
[1:37:17] if he's still jesus
[1:37:24] if he's still jesus then why shouldn't
[1:37:27] we believe in healing
[1:37:31] will you say brother andrew your church
[1:37:34] seems a little bit shook up here lately
[1:37:37] you've had four funerals and you want to
[1:37:40] preach on healing
[1:37:41] absolutely how much more perfect
[1:37:46] could sister irene's healing be then
[1:37:48] what she got
[1:37:50] how much more perfect for sister katie
[1:37:52] and brother john
[1:37:54] how much perfect can it be when jesus
[1:37:57] come
[1:37:57] and completely healed them
[1:38:02] you say well i was praying all the way
[1:38:03] through i was praying all the way
[1:38:05] through too
[1:38:06] but jesus did the work that only he
[1:38:09] could do
[1:38:11] where they are they ain't got to worry
[1:38:12] about old age where they are they ain't
[1:38:14] going to worry about a 401k
[1:38:16] they ain't got to worry about who's
[1:38:17] getting in in 2020. they know jesus is
[1:38:20] king
[1:38:23] oh hallelujah
[1:38:28] if he's still jesus then why shouldn't
[1:38:30] we take him at his word
[1:38:33] do you believe he's still jesus and that
[1:38:35] the bible tells us that surely
[1:38:37] he hath borne our griefs isaiah 53 and 4
[1:38:41] and carried our sorrows yet we did
[1:38:43] esteem him
[1:38:44] stricken spitting of god and afflicted
[1:38:47] but he was wounded for our
[1:38:49] transgressions
[1:38:50] he was bruised for our iniquities the
[1:38:52] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[1:38:55] and with his stripes we
[1:38:58] are healed
[1:39:01] if he's still jesus then why should we
[1:39:03] believe this
[1:39:07] you see your sickness as well as your
[1:39:09] sins were laid on jesus at calvary
[1:39:12] and you know that if jesus bore your
[1:39:14] infirmities and your sickness
[1:39:16] you no longer need to bear them
[1:39:21] do you believe that everything that was
[1:39:24] stacked up against you was put on jesus
[1:39:28] then you don't have to carry that burden
[1:39:30] no more
[1:39:35] i watched i watched as the spirit of the
[1:39:37] lord one night
[1:39:38] began to deal with a young lady here
[1:39:41] that was carrying a tremendous burden
[1:39:43] and when all of a sudden the spirit of
[1:39:44] the lord spoke to me and tell her
[1:39:46] tell her that i she don't need to carry
[1:39:49] that burden
[1:39:50] i carried it a long time ago i watched
[1:39:52] as the spirit of the lord
[1:39:54] came down and lifted that thing off of
[1:39:56] her
[1:39:57] why should you carry your burdens when
[1:40:00] jesus
[1:40:00] already carried your burdens why should
[1:40:02] you try to beat yourself
[1:40:04] over your sins when jesus was already
[1:40:07] beat for your sins
[1:40:09] if he's still jesus then why don't we
[1:40:12] take him at his word
[1:40:15] he said psalms 103 bless the lord o my
[1:40:18] soul
[1:40:19] and all that is within me bless his holy
[1:40:22] name
[1:40:23] bless the lord on my soul and forget not
[1:40:25] all of his benefits
[1:40:26] who forgiveth all thine iniquities who
[1:40:29] healeth all of thy diseases
[1:40:32] is he still jesus jeremiah 30 and 17 for
[1:40:36] i will restore health
[1:40:37] unto thee and i will heal thee of thy
[1:40:41] wounds saith the lord
[1:40:43] if he's still jesus isaiah 40 and 29
[1:40:47] he giveth power to the faint and to them
[1:40:49] that have no might he
[1:40:50] increases strength verse 31 but they
[1:40:53] that wait upon the lord
[1:40:55] shall renew their strength they shall
[1:40:57] mount up with wings as eagles
[1:40:59] they shall run and not be weary they
[1:41:01] shall walk and not
[1:41:02] faint he is still jesus
[1:41:07] when a leper came to him and began to
[1:41:09] worship him and begin to speak to him
[1:41:12] and he said will thou make me clean if
[1:41:15] thou
[1:41:15] will thou can't make me clean and jesus
[1:41:18] said i will
[1:41:19] be thou clean and at that moment
[1:41:23] immediately the leper was cleansed if
[1:41:26] you walked into this building with sin
[1:41:28] on your life as a leper
[1:41:29] you can be thou cling because as i
[1:41:32] said i will be thou clean
[1:41:39] when the blind man in john chapter 9
[1:41:43] and the message believers of the day
[1:41:45] that knew everything about it
[1:41:48] they come to him and he said when his
[1:41:51] parents
[1:41:52] were too ashamed to say what had
[1:41:54] happened
[1:41:55] they came to him and they said give god
[1:41:57] praise
[1:41:59] this man is a sinner
[1:42:02] he so whether he's a sinner or not
[1:42:06] i don't know but this thing i wonder i
[1:42:09] do know
[1:42:10] that once i was blind but now i see
[1:42:13] he's still jesus this i know
[1:42:17] that he i once was blind but now i see
[1:42:20] this i know i once was lost when i
[1:42:24] couldn't find my way home
[1:42:25] when i was strung out on drugs and i was
[1:42:27] praying god
[1:42:28] if you'll get me home and not let me
[1:42:31] wreck i'll serve you the rest of days of
[1:42:33] my life
[1:42:34] and jesus got me home and jesus never
[1:42:38] left me
[1:42:39] jesus has never forsaken me and i want
[1:42:41] to say this to you
[1:42:42] if you've got somebody that struck out
[1:42:44] on cigarettes strung out on drugs
[1:42:47] shrug out on alcohol strung out on sin
[1:42:50] jesus is still jesus
[1:42:57] that black shadow that keeps following
[1:42:59] you jesus is still jesus
[1:43:04] that demon of hell that's telling you
[1:43:06] that you're gonna have to deal with that
[1:43:08] pain
[1:43:08] the rest of your life jesus is still
[1:43:10] jesus
[1:43:12] whew i ain't peter and i ain't paul but
[1:43:15] i
[1:43:16] am in truth and i know that jesus is
[1:43:18] still jesus
[1:43:24] give him a hand clap a praise because
[1:43:27] he's still
[1:43:28] jesus he's still jesus
[1:43:36] psalm 77 and 14 thou art the god that
[1:43:40] dost wonders
[1:43:42] thou hast declared thy strength among
[1:43:44] the people
[1:43:46] he's still jesus
[1:43:49] when jesus had the ability to heal all
[1:43:52] people
[1:43:54] but yet he would only do as the father
[1:43:57] would show him when he walked in in john
[1:44:01] chapter 5 at the bull
[1:44:02] at the pool of bethesda and he walks in
[1:44:05] there and there he laid a man that was
[1:44:07] dealing with this infirmity for 38 years
[1:44:09] and jesus began to speak to him he began
[1:44:13] to speak to him
[1:44:14] he began to talk to him everybody else
[1:44:17] around it
[1:44:18] everybody else around him he had the
[1:44:20] power to heal everybody
[1:44:22] but because the father had showed him
[1:44:25] this one
[1:44:26] he walked to this one he said will thou
[1:44:29] be
[1:44:29] made whole he said i would but when the
[1:44:33] time and the seasons come there's have
[1:44:35] no man to put me down in the water
[1:44:38] and jesus said take up thy bed
[1:44:41] and walk and he walked away there with
[1:44:44] his palate that he had set on for years
[1:44:47] upon years upon years and he walked out
[1:44:50] of there
[1:44:51] if he's still jesus you can walk
[1:44:56] you can tell about it if he's still
[1:44:58] jesus you can walk
[1:45:01] as brother shannon sings it if he walked
[1:45:03] out of the grave i'mma walk into
[1:45:06] if he believed jesus i'm believing jesus
[1:45:08] too
[1:45:09] if he accepted jesus i'll accept jesus
[1:45:12] too
[1:45:12] no matter what you're going through he's
[1:45:15] still
[1:45:16] jesus
[1:45:20] if he's still jesus then why shouldn't
[1:45:22] we lift up his name
[1:45:25] when his name is above every name
[1:45:28] there's neither salvation in any other
[1:45:30] name but by the name of jesus
[1:45:32] that at the name of jesus christ every
[1:45:34] demon has to take his leave
[1:45:39] the bible said in acts chapter 3 and
[1:45:41] translate over into
[1:45:42] chapter 4 that when they begin to deal
[1:45:44] with them
[1:45:45] we deal with peter and john that they
[1:45:47] took knowledge and they took notice that
[1:45:49] they had been with jesus
[1:45:50] that these men were unlearned when they
[1:45:53] walked up to that man that had laid
[1:45:55] there for all those years
[1:45:56] lame at the at the beautiful gate and
[1:45:59] walked up there
[1:46:00] and he began he began to look on him
[1:46:04] and he said he was asking for homes but
[1:46:07] peter said silver and gold have i none
[1:46:09] but such as i have give i thee in the
[1:46:11] name of jesus christ
[1:46:12] rise up and walk what was it
[1:46:16] it was the same jesus that was working
[1:46:19] through peter
[1:46:20] and working through john working through
[1:46:22] the apostles
[1:46:23] and if he's still jesus all of hell has
[1:46:26] to take notice
[1:46:27] that we've been with jesus we may be
[1:46:30] unlearned
[1:46:30] we may seem like we ain't got a very
[1:46:32] good education but all of hell has to
[1:46:35] notice
[1:46:35] that we've been with jesus take notice
[1:46:39] tonight all of hell
[1:46:40] full gospel lighthouse has been with
[1:46:43] jesus
[1:46:47] oh don't get nervous on me it's them
[1:46:50] demons that are running
[1:46:52] they're noticing that you are in the
[1:46:54] presence of an almighty god
[1:46:57] and he's still the same yesterday today
[1:47:00] and forever
[1:47:01] [Applause]
[1:47:03] [Music]
[1:47:04] if he healed a blood issue for 12 years
[1:47:07] and he's still jesus
[1:47:08] he can still do the same if he brought
[1:47:11] life to a dead womb
[1:47:12] that was almost 90 years old he can
[1:47:15] change
[1:47:15] every molecular cell in your body and
[1:47:18] make it produce
[1:47:19] everything that he has predestined you
[1:47:22] to do
[1:47:29] he's still jesus
[1:47:35] and this is a faith that was delivered
[1:47:37] to the saints
[1:47:40] producing the same works same power
[1:47:44] same works same wonder same life
[1:47:47] because he is still
[1:47:50] jesus
[1:47:57] i hope this is okay brother nathaniel if
[1:48:00] it ain't
[1:48:01] you can tell me and they brothers can
[1:48:04] edit the tape
[1:48:06] but i believe that there's power in sons
[1:48:09] and daughters of god
[1:48:11] the bible says lay hands on a sick and
[1:48:13] they shall recover
[1:48:15] brother nathanael had gotten he's had to
[1:48:18] deal with patience on every level
[1:48:20] but he had to deal with an individual a
[1:48:22] man that was that was actively dying
[1:48:25] and he went into the room and every time
[1:48:27] he would get close brother nathanael
[1:48:29] would take him by the hand he'd take him
[1:48:31] by the hand just somebody to be there
[1:48:34] and every time he'd take him by the hand
[1:48:36] he would kind of revive himself
[1:48:39] and just level out
[1:48:43] he'd come too close to the end again
[1:48:45] brother nathanael came
[1:48:47] and he knew that he was actively dying
[1:48:48] that he just wanted to be there
[1:48:51] he come that close and when brother
[1:48:53] nathaniel laid his hands on him he kind
[1:48:54] of revived a bit
[1:48:56] and finally brother nathaniel realized
[1:48:59] that it's the
[1:49:00] power that's working in me that they
[1:49:03] shall lay hands on the sick and they
[1:49:04] shall recover
[1:49:06] and when he went in the room and he
[1:49:07] didn't lay his hands on him he was able
[1:49:09] to pass away from this life
[1:49:12] because there's so much power that's
[1:49:14] setting in the throne room
[1:49:16] of a believer if it has that much power
[1:49:20] to revive a dead man that was actively
[1:49:22] dying what will it do when you lay your
[1:49:25] hands
[1:49:26] when you are sick when you are afflicted
[1:49:28] when you're going through trials
[1:49:30] when it seems nobody loves you when it
[1:49:32] seems like everybody else is give up
[1:49:34] around you
[1:49:34] what will it do when a believer goes to
[1:49:37] laying his hands on a sick
[1:49:39] they shall recover because he's still
[1:49:42] jesus
[1:49:48] i was standing right here at this altar
[1:49:50] one night brother randy hickel came down
[1:49:51] here for prayer
[1:49:52] and all of a sudden brother ann randy
[1:49:54] has dealt with cancer dear issues
[1:49:56] throughout his life
[1:49:57] and had to deal with all kinds of things
[1:49:59] but there at that altar
[1:50:00] i can tell you when the spirit of the
[1:50:02] lord came down it began to reach out it
[1:50:05] felt like an electroshock
[1:50:06] went through my body and went
[1:50:08] transferred right to him
[1:50:10] i still have the paper in my bible
[1:50:14] randy henkel didn't accept cancer on
[1:50:16] this such and such day
[1:50:20] we're not going to accept cancer this
[1:50:22] day
[1:50:23] nor tomorrow because jesus is still
[1:50:26] jesus
[1:50:31] we will not accept depression because
[1:50:33] jesus
[1:50:34] is still jesus we will not accept
[1:50:37] suicide
[1:50:38] because jesus is still jesus we won't
[1:50:40] accept
[1:50:41] back pain because jesus is still jesus
[1:50:46] brother herald we won't accept heart
[1:50:48] issues
[1:50:49] because jesus is still jesus brother
[1:50:52] on completely healed because jesus
[1:50:55] is still jesus sister erica parker
[1:50:58] jesus is still jesus
[1:51:01] every believer that's sitting under the
[1:51:03] sound of the voice
[1:51:05] he's still jesus so why shouldn't we
[1:51:09] believe him to do the same thing that he
[1:51:11] did then
[1:51:12] do it right now that same angels in the
[1:51:16] building
[1:51:17] that same powers here that same
[1:51:19] anointing's here
[1:51:20] and he still jesus
[1:51:30] what's in your hand what's in your mouth
[1:51:35] the name of jesus
[1:51:39] have you ever been around us spencer's
[1:51:43] we go to an auction we want something we
[1:51:45] gonna get it
[1:51:48] we're goal-oriented man
[1:51:52] i knew dad looked at a guy one time
[1:51:58] he looked at a guy one time he's
[1:52:02] don't mess with me i'm getting that
[1:52:07] and this guy got so upset i mean he was
[1:52:10] he was some kind of man and it don't
[1:52:14] help when his son's right behind him
[1:52:16] go ahead go ahead go ahead
[1:52:19] and when i see somebody getting all up
[1:52:21] tight because they really want something
[1:52:23] it just puts a little fire on there
[1:52:26] but this is my philosophy and my concept
[1:52:28] that if you want something bad enough
[1:52:30] you'll keep your hand up at an auction
[1:52:33] but if you don't want something don't
[1:52:34] keep your hand up
[1:52:37] if you accidentally sneeze they'll put
[1:52:39] it on your ticket
[1:52:41] but if you really want something bad
[1:52:42] enough you keep your hand up
[1:52:45] hey when it comes to an auction we're
[1:52:47] vicious
[1:52:49] we don't care we gotta overpay it if we
[1:52:51] want it i don't care what the price is
[1:52:53] i'm gonna pay for it if i really want it
[1:52:56] it may take me
[1:52:58] i may have to go through the rain i may
[1:53:00] have to go through the snow
[1:53:01] i may have to go through hell and high
[1:53:03] water but if i want something i'm going
[1:53:05] to keep my hands up
[1:53:06] and my hands are lifted up that i want
[1:53:09] complete deliverance
[1:53:10] for ron spencer full gospel lighthouse
[1:53:14] hell may be against you but keep your
[1:53:16] hands up
[1:53:18] we want this bad all hell's got to take
[1:53:20] notice that our hands are up
[1:53:24] i've been with jesus and i ain't backing
[1:53:27] up
[1:53:28] well you say it's just for joy keep your
[1:53:30] hands uh you say it's just for peace
[1:53:32] keep your hands up if you say it's just
[1:53:35] for healing keep your hands up
[1:53:37] i want it and if i want it i'm gonna get
[1:53:40] it
[1:53:41] because the father's head all things are
[1:53:43] freely given
[1:53:44] unto you and if god be for me who can be
[1:53:47] against me
[1:53:49] hell can try to put these hands down
[1:53:52] hell can try to put these hands down but
[1:53:54] as moses had somebody come by
[1:53:57] and hold his hands up so that joshua
[1:53:59] could defeat the enemy
[1:54:01] oh if you ain't got strength to hold
[1:54:03] your hands up brother jeffrey
[1:54:04] i'll come and hold your hands up if you
[1:54:07] ain't got strength brother nate to hold
[1:54:08] your hands up
[1:54:09] i'm gonna hold your hand because i
[1:54:11] believe that jesus
[1:54:13] is still jesus
[1:54:17] why shouldn't we believe in a place
[1:54:20] called heaven
[1:54:21] when he's told us all about it
[1:54:25] whoo hallelujah you mind if i give you a
[1:54:28] few more scriptures
[1:54:31] the bible says in revelations 21 and 1
[1:54:34] and i saw a new heaven
[1:54:36] so why shouldn't i believe in heaven
[1:54:40] and a new earth for the first heaven and
[1:54:42] the first earth
[1:54:44] first earth were passed away and there
[1:54:46] was no more sea
[1:54:47] and i john i the bride saw the holy
[1:54:51] he knew jerusalem coming down from god
[1:54:53] out of heaven
[1:54:54] prepared as a bride a dorm for a husband
[1:54:57] and i heard a great voice out of heaven
[1:54:59] saying
[1:54:59] behold the tabernacle of god is with men
[1:55:02] and he will dwell with them
[1:55:04] and they shall be his people and god
[1:55:06] himself shall be with them
[1:55:08] and be their god and god shall wipe away
[1:55:13] all their tears from their eyes
[1:55:16] and there shall be no more death
[1:55:19] there shall be no more sorrow nor crying
[1:55:22] neither shall there be any more pain for
[1:55:25] the former things
[1:55:27] are passed away why shouldn't we believe
[1:55:31] in a place called heaven when i heard a
[1:55:34] prophet say
[1:55:35] that these are things that are to be
[1:55:39] that this rapture will put you there
[1:55:43] why shouldn't we believe it
[1:55:46] i better have myself a conniption fit
[1:55:49] this morning
[1:55:50] knowing what i was studying on and going
[1:55:52] over these things
[1:55:54] looking at what brother branham said on
[1:55:56] then why shouldn't we
[1:55:58] he said brother george and beyond
[1:56:00] occurring in time said brother george
[1:56:02] you won't be old and crippled over there
[1:56:04] and he said brother and sister spencer
[1:56:07] and some of these old some of these
[1:56:09] older folks setting forth
[1:56:11] we'll be young there forever this robe
[1:56:14] of flesh i'll drop
[1:56:15] and rise and seize the everlasting prize
[1:56:17] and shout while passing through the air
[1:56:20] farewell farewell sweet hour of prayer
[1:56:23] it's all over
[1:56:24] no more long nights of praying just
[1:56:26] enter into that young
[1:56:28] joyful age to be there not just for one
[1:56:32] year
[1:56:34] or 50 years or a million years
[1:56:37] but when we've been there 100 billion
[1:56:39] years
[1:56:40] we won't even be started at all so why
[1:56:43] shouldn't we be happy this morning
[1:56:45] why shouldn't we rejoice why shouldn't
[1:56:48] we take advantage
[1:56:49] of every great thing that god has given
[1:56:52] us
[1:56:53] why shouldn't we happy why shouldn't we
[1:56:56] rejoice about these things
[1:56:59] can you give me one good reason why why
[1:57:03] we shouldn't believe it
[1:57:09] why we shouldn't believe in heaven can
[1:57:11] anybody stand up and tell me why we
[1:57:13] shouldn't believe in heaven when jesus
[1:57:15] has said it in his own word
[1:57:17] that where i am there you will be also
[1:57:22] he said let not your hearts be troubled
[1:57:25] you believe in god believe also in me
[1:57:28] in my father's house are many mansions
[1:57:30] that if it were not so i would have told
[1:57:32] you
[1:57:32] i go to prepare a place for you
[1:57:36] do you believe that jesus is still jesus
[1:57:41] why shouldn't we take him at his word
[1:57:43] and if i go prepare a place for you
[1:57:46] i will come again and receive you unto
[1:57:48] myself that where i
[1:57:49] am you may be also
[1:57:54] you see we're living in a pest house
[1:57:59] a pest house is where they put all
[1:58:02] diseased people
[1:58:03] well that's just the way sin done to us
[1:58:06] it put us in an earthly pest house
[1:58:09] he wouldn't let anyone else come in the
[1:58:11] past house because
[1:58:12] there's all kinds of germs flying around
[1:58:14] in there and people would take these
[1:58:16] germs
[1:58:17] and be sick themselves and sin brought
[1:58:19] us into the devil's pest house
[1:58:23] that's what syndal did to us it brought
[1:58:26] us in
[1:58:27] to the devil's pest house oh
[1:58:30] but there is another one called my
[1:58:32] father's house
[1:58:34] i'll go and prepare a place for you and
[1:58:37] take you out of this pest house
[1:58:39] and deliver you into my father's house
[1:58:42] there you are and take you out of this
[1:58:43] old earthly past house
[1:58:45] he's gone to prepare a place a perfect
[1:58:48] place where no evil exists
[1:58:49] no sickness exists no old age exists
[1:58:52] no death exists it's a perfect place
[1:58:55] calling you
[1:58:56] to that perfection and you have to be
[1:58:59] perfect to get there
[1:59:01] the bible said jesus said be therefore
[1:59:04] perfect as your
[1:59:05] father in heaven is perfect it's a
[1:59:08] perfecting
[1:59:09] kingdom so it must be a perfect people
[1:59:12] come
[1:59:12] because you have to stand and be married
[1:59:15] to a perfect son of god
[1:59:17] and you must be a perfect bride so how
[1:59:21] can you do it through anything else but
[1:59:23] the perfect word of god
[1:59:24] which is the waters of separation that
[1:59:27] watches
[1:59:28] washes us from our sins that's right the
[1:59:30] blood of jesus christ
[1:59:32] think of it the dripping bloody word the
[1:59:35] blood the word of god
[1:59:36] bleeding blood to wash the bride in
[1:59:40] she stands perfect she's virgin
[1:59:44] she's unadulterated she never sinned in
[1:59:46] the first place
[1:59:48] she was just trapped into it
[1:59:52] we don't have to deal with this old past
[1:59:54] house much more we're going to the
[1:59:56] father's house
[1:59:58] why shouldn't we believe in it
[2:00:02] why shouldn't we believe in all of these
[2:00:03] promises when he said no weapon that has
[2:00:06] formed against thee shall prosper
[2:00:08] and every tongue that rise against thee
[2:00:10] thou shalt condemn that this
[2:00:12] is the heritage of the servants of the
[2:00:14] lord
[2:00:16] why shouldn't we believe him at his word
[2:00:19] why shouldn't we take that this is what
[2:00:21] he said
[2:00:22] i believe it i'll stand with it
[2:00:29] why shouldn't we believe it does anybody
[2:00:32] here got a good reason why we shouldn't
[2:00:33] believe it
[2:00:35] well my friend they've kind of just gave
[2:00:39] up hope and they kind of walked away
[2:00:41] why shouldn't i believe this just
[2:00:43] because your carnal friend
[2:00:45] wouldn't walk his way when jesus turned
[2:00:49] to them
[2:00:49] when they when they were standing there
[2:00:51] and they begin to walk away and he
[2:00:53] turned to peter
[2:00:54] and he said will you also go peter said
[2:00:57] where will we go
[2:01:00] i'm not going nowhere there's nowhere
[2:01:02] that has this word
[2:01:03] of eternal life but by you why should i
[2:01:07] walk away
[2:01:08] just because people of great stature
[2:01:10] walked away
[2:01:11] i'm not walking away from life i'm not
[2:01:14] walking away from joy i'm not walking
[2:01:17] away from my shout
[2:01:18] i'm not walking away from my praise i'm
[2:01:20] not walking away from this message
[2:01:22] this message will change my body
[2:01:26] why shouldn't we believe it
[2:01:30] if he said it then why in the world
[2:01:32] should we put up with the devil
[2:01:34] then why in the world should we listen
[2:01:36] to his lies if jesus said
[2:01:38] that you can live a peaceable life let's
[2:01:41] live a peaceable life
[2:01:44] why should you put up with his traps and
[2:01:46] his tactics why
[2:01:48] give me one good reason why you should
[2:01:50] listen to the devil
[2:01:52] sister joy you've got any good reasons
[2:01:54] sister faith sister katie anybody here
[2:01:56] got a good reason why you should listen
[2:01:58] to the devil
[2:01:59] he's the father of lies why should i
[2:02:03] listen to him
[2:02:05] [Laughter]
[2:02:08] why should i listen to him when he says
[2:02:10] i'm gonna kill your daddy
[2:02:12] why in the world should i listen to him
[2:02:14] gabriel
[2:02:16] hallelujah you can't kill a son of god
[2:02:20] we're a part of god
[2:02:26] what are you packing i'm not talking
[2:02:29] about you
[2:02:31] you brothers got that thing slipped in
[2:02:33] beside your hip bear
[2:02:34] but will you pack it
[2:02:37] it's okay you're well protected here
[2:02:41] by the brothers and by the angels
[2:02:46] you ain't got to worry when two idiots
[2:02:48] showed up here
[2:02:50] we just put our best at them
[2:02:53] we put brother josh's brother out and
[2:02:54] brother matthew if that don't scare
[2:02:57] idiots away i don't know what will
[2:03:00] it's all it took when idiots decided
[2:03:03] they were going to come and disrupt this
[2:03:05] service
[2:03:08] josh walks out there matthew walks out
[2:03:10] there out and walks there
[2:03:11] i'd say that the devil that was inside
[2:03:14] of those two idiots
