========================================

[Applause] what you greet your neighbor with a hearty good morning to you its hallelujah amen John you did my heart a world a good buddy so good to have you here in the house of the Lord you look good set in there well Josh wouldn't that be a good permanent spot for him yeah I like that real well [Music] ha for those that don't know John maybe knew that don't know John John is my buddy if we go back a long long time and a lot of debt and gratitude to him and we've been friends and some good times and rough times and and and the right times and so we thank the Lord for that he God brought him through a heart surgery this list last year and sometimes heart surgeries don't don't leave us with a lot of strength but we sure glad to have you with us here today John and we said we love you with all of our hearts so love each and every one of you didn't it good to be in the household a man I was thinking this morning as I was thinking as we're closing the year down and I was thinking about all the great times that we've had this year the great preachers that have stood behind this sacred desk and preached the Word of God and we've had the best of the best God's been so good to us they've came and preached in convention like atmospheres whether it was normal services or labor day meetings and you as an audience are so pleasurable to preach to I think about that it's kind of almost difficult sometimes for us to go away because this is a convention atmosphere almost every service and so you bring that you're the one coming pulling on the word of the Lord and we thank you for that and as we press towards a new year may it only get stronger and stronger and stronger and we come and we look back at the cycles of a decade or a cycle of a year and and go when we see the ones that have left us and they're Tamron out and they're standing on the other side screaming come on come on come on we didn't lose them we just gained heavens glory and so we want to just so take advantage of the time that we have here thank you for you being here on this morning and we certainly love you with all of our hearts if you will turn with me to Joshua chapter one this morning a man got a note this morning that just encouraged my heart to preach with everything that's in me a precious sister that is calling out for God to do a miracle in her life and and she's already listened to last night service twice this morning amen brother Jeremy and she's a long way away from here but she said that's exactly what she needed she said the doctor has give her up and and we just pray that God would just reach forth today minister to her and take her by the hand in a special way and several others have already wrote me this morning about what last night's meeting meant to them so may today be just as powerful and you might be find this interesting but the other Tim Pruett is preaching on this morning courage we must have the same boss amen he sent me his text this morning I said wow wow wow Devils in for a really bad day today and say Amen god bless you we love you with all of our hearts and we wish you a a happy new year we'll be gone next weekend - brother bisko's and brother Tom raised to preach their New Year's meeting and so if you would pray for me that God would just be with us you want to tune in to that you can that'll be on Friday night no sir Saturday service and then Sunday morning and Sunday night remember there's three to four hours difference in us so amen god bless you if you pray for us that God would do a work for us amen how many we do that a man well God bless the rest of you amen how might we do that god bless you amen Joshua chapter one and verse five there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so while I would be with thee I will not fail me nor forsake thee be strong and of good courage for under this people doubt something divided for an inheritance the land which I swear into their fathers to give them only be strong and very courageous that thou mayst observe to do all according to the law which Moses my servant commanded thee turn not from the right hand or the left hand left that thou mayst herbs prosper whether so ever thou goest this book the law shall not depart out of the mouth but thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayst observe to do according to all that is written therein for then shalt thou make thy way prosperous and then shalt thou have good success have none I commanded thee be strong and of a good courage be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest you may be seated may the Lord bless the reading of his word this morning a man hemming is ready to have Church amen any good to us fear is mentioned in the scriptures 600 times so it's something that we will have to deal with as mortal beings the scripture tells us that man is born of woman it's few days and it's full of trouble this is the only spot that you're going to have to deal with that Satan's temptations and his trials and his and his mockery and all of that the things that he would come against you with so he knows that he only has a lot of time to do that whether we're born there and and live a week or we live to be a hundred and ten years old sister Nancy's mother's 98 years old it is a body that now has become a body of torment it's the body that has trapped her but one day God will liberate her and give her a brand new body the body that we're going to is a body that don't have any tall or agony or sorrow it'll never be afflicted ever again so Satan realizes that this is the only spot he couldn't get to you in God before the foundation of the world but this is the only time element that he'll ever be able to get to you now we realize in our feeble humanity that sometimes we run out of fuel we run out of energy we run out of desire sometimes sometimes we can't see through the corner next week we don't know how in the world we're going to make it but when we realized that God is inside of us and God is omnipotent he's infinite he's got the whole world in his hands sometimes we can't see kind of we want to we want to have a faith to word that we can see it happening well let's just think about the faith that God has he spends a world into existence and he tosses his on his fingertips and and he hangs it in midair and it's never lost a revolution and when he's spinning in midair it's the only plan in our celestial zodiac to which it's got life on it are you with me of all the millions of stars that that God just spend into the universe this is the only one that's got life are you with him it makes a good conspiracy theory that there's more urgency and there's this one that and that and that and that but this one seems to be the only one that's got love and God spoke it into existence and spend it and he hung it on nothing so if God could do that what about God being able to take care of you he said one day Adams race had been backed into a corner the law had failed justice had failed the prophets had failed the judges had failed everything that God said to the earth had failed and Adams race stood defeated sickness among them death among them everything the death orison in every place nothing could be done but in heaven there was one that stepped out the Son of God and said this day I give my life for Adams race the Angels asked him what would you do what would you do he came to he came to earth and he looked upon a juh men and women that wanted to serve the Lord they couldn't they couldn't let me just say there was a time in my life I wanted to serve God but I couldn't I've made vows I made promises that I could and I just seemed to be falling back in the same rut over and over and over again but when you finally made Jesus are you with me he makes the difference in your life [Music] so much temptation so much sin so much sickness so much troubles on every hand everything had failed and he looked tell the darkest spot of man's fear that was death it's always been our greatest fear was death and he ran to Calvary and got the thickest bunch of spears and throwed them into his heart and cried back take what I leave and the baptism of the Holy Ghost and fight the scripture says this is when the enemy shall come in like a flood and he's ever felt like he came your way when the enemy shall come in like a flood the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him John 19 10 we mentioned this last night then set the decide palette unto Him speakers down not unto me down down knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee and power to release thee that was a mortal man looking at Jesus thinkin I had power to kill you I have power to give you life are you in me and without God God gave him the oxygen to breathe just sometimes you need to look at the ones that are so tormenting you and just and all of their their vocals and all of their cursings and other making funds just laugh at it it is my God that gives you strength it is my God that gives you the oxygen to breathe that you're cursing with and jesus answered thou could us have no power and all against me except it were given thee from above therefore he delivered me unto thee hath the greatest sin the scriptures of the mark chapter 16 in verse 15 which is the final commission and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature and he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved and he that believeth not shall be damned notice this now and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover Ezekiel chapter 10 and verse 4 I believe it is I rise for this matter belongeth unto thee we also will be with thee and be of good courage and do it Andrew sent me this note last night after preaching the service arouse cannot stop crying we're with you be of good courage do it hallelujah brother on I didn't know us coming to a pep rally yep you are I read this to you last night I wrote some things down the other day I've been sick before but I made it I've been broke before but I made it you remember them days brother John I've been brokenhearted before and maybe they've ever been brokenhearted but I made it I tried all night but I made it I've been betrayed but I made it I've been lied on but I made it I've been destitute but I made it I've been rejected won't you just tell the devil I made it [Applause] some things go good with a smile won't you just tell him I met you thought you had me but I made it you thought she's gonna destroy me but I made it out of there must I be carried home to heaven on a flowery bed of ease while others fought to win the prize and they'll sail through bloodied seas if I must rain if I must fight I'm a shrink increase my courage Lord here's another little saying for you amen I like it when I get inspired and we start writing a little bit be still and know that I'm God we just got to get to a spot sometimes we're going to just you know silences gives quite for a few minutes I'm better than your problem I'm bigger than your circumstance I'm bigger than your situation this is not your battle you don't have to handle this go ahead smile now go in smile it's a happy congregation this is God's battle just lay your hand over on the seat of the people that ain't here today that you know should be here just say this is God's battle this now listen after a while you gonna you're gonna be fussy because things are getting tight in here but remember it was you that laid your hand over on the seat and you said this is God's battle you don't have to handle this this is God's battle God will work it out all you have to do is be still and know that I am God but the Brandon was answering the critic he says how do you feel brother Brandon when you stand there and see people coming in different languages and things are you afraid no sir no sir he said never been afraid yet because he told me and I believe that it's the truth if he told me tonight to go to the presidential graveyard and raise up George Washington and tomorrow morning I'd invite the whole world come and see it done and he said bring every critic that you can and stand them around you're going to see the glory of God it said a chair over there where you can sit down and rest a little while he'll be here in just a few minutes that's confidence in it didn't it he said Jesus never cried when they brought the maniac boy to him the one that had Apple epsy falling into the fire he never said father I'm your son and and now you sent me here to do so and so can I heal this boy he never said that he said come out of him Satan and spoke to that boy and that boy was well when he meant legion with 2,000 Devils in him it wasn't Jesus a crying it was the devils that were crying and if you're going to cast us out suffer us to go into that herd of swine jesus said now father am I able to do this he said come out of him and that Devils took their flight sure he knowed he was the Messiah let me just understand sometimes good people get all the hooky spooks about casting out Devils just know who you are just know who you are you're a son and daughter of God and you got more authority than the angels that are in heaven stand in your place stand in your spot and say Dada get out of here at the grave of Lazarus he had been dead for four days and they said if you would have been your lord he would not have died he said I am the resurrection in life not where when or how he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live he knowed who he was he knowed what he was he note that he was Emmanuel he know that he was the resurrection he knowed that he was the life he knowed that in him dwelt the fullness of the Godhead bodily and he seen them the little people there he had seen what God had had told them him been to do and there he was he never said no wait I'll go down here and kneel for a little while and pray you believe that I'm able to do this it wasn't him they say gaylord I believe that you're the Son of God and was to come into the world there he identified something has got to happen he stepped forth to the tomb after they had rolled the stone away and he called him by name Lazarus come forth Jesus could have called a general resurrection that day there will come a resurrection we believe some of our loved ones with their with the crown of that that casket their head facing the coming Sun of tomorrow morning that's more than a tradition there's a covenant with God one of these mornings on Resurrection morning they're going to come up out of that grave it's lower than a song brother Shannon ain't no grave gonna hold my body down I like that part in that song when he walked out that grave I'm a walking to [Applause] hallelujah I was identified with him hanging on the cross I was identified him when they beat him until he was unrecognizable as a human being and put a plat of thorns on him and a robe around him that would stick to his body and then later pull it off I was identified as he walked up the hill and they spit on him and and they mocked him and they called him every bad name in the world I'm proud to be identified with Jesus Christ you talking about courage it took courage godly courage that every person in the world seemed to be against him every municipality and government was turned against him and they were screaming for Barabbas and screaming that he would be crucified but he was on a mission and he would not be turned around I want you to know I'm on a mission I'm on a mission young lady they sent that letter to me this morning you don't have to die you don't have to die Jesus paid the price of redemption he paid for the healing power reach and claim your promise [Applause] he spake and the blind saw the lame walk the Deaf heard devil screamed had come out dad was raised he said he didn't have to go pray through he was there knowing in messiah he was that messiah he knew who he was he was in his position he know that he was said to do he knowed that the father had identified him to be the messiah to be the believer and when he met that believer with faith he spoke and devil scattered he knew his God's given rocks he knew what he was sometimes we don't moses forgot samson understood others understood joshua understood moses forgot god had to call his attention to it why are you crying out to me i seat you to do a job speak and go on to your objective i've told you to come to this mountain take them children and lead them on just speak i don't care what's in your way move it out of your way i give you authority to do it you spoke flies and flees and creation and things like that he said now what are you hollering about to me now why are you coming to me hollering about these things just speak and watch it move on Jesus everything that he had he spoke the word and it was so God had properly vindicated him this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased to dwell watch him I like this how bravely how majestically he stood there before his critics he said destroy this temple and I'll pray the Father and see what he does about it destroy this temple and in three days I'll raise it up it wasn't a hope so I'm going to do it seems like sometimes a very difficult day we're coming up on the anniversary of laying my mother into the grave and three years ago and her dying words as she was slipping over I'm ready to go because my mother realized this is not the end my mother's not a great headed woman today are you with me she's not great headed woman she doesn't have to worry with her with her ankles and her and her knees and the high blood pressure in the heart condition that she fought for so many years my mom was a fun-loving she listened she wrote every roller coaster in this region and she did it screaming to the top of her lungs with her mouth wide open and her smile was from the air to here she was full of life she loved her family she loved her grandchildren she loved God with all of her heart has not diminished the same scripture that said he will raise up his body gives us authority power in the name of Jesus Christ cast out Devils and speak with no tongues and they'll take up serpents and drink any deadly thing it will hurt them if they lay hands on the sick they shall recover possessing the enemy skates he said he'd died till the Sun got ashamed of itself he died until nature got ashamed and it failed to operate the Sun went down in the middle of the day the stars wouldn't even come out he died until the elements were so black until you couldn't see your hand in front of the middle of the day I'd imagine nature said let me die with him brother the devil sent his place his soul into the bottomless pits of Hell and the gates open but when he came out on that third day he conquered it his seed shall possess the gates of the enemy he conquered death he conquered hell and on Easter morning he conquered the grave I'd like to report to you as Christian believers you can go to our champions tune it's still empty it's still empty it's a place where he laid he didn't mean to bite he didn't need to bite he just needed to borrow it hallelujah he wasn't gonna lay there but just a couple of days I like hello could not hold my champion [Applause] Muhammad Ali was a mighty champion Mike Tyson was a mighty champion but one day they meet there there in a man Napoleon was a mighty champion Alexander the Great was a mighty champion Caesar Augustus was a mighty champion not going to mention George Washington was a mighty champion but all of them with me death but when my Jesus met death it was only a portal that he would step through to go get Abraham Isaac and Jacob and to get the keys of hell and fame it to take the sting up yes we got to fear it no more Isaiah 54 says behold I have created the Smith that blow at the coals in the fire there bringing forth an instrument for his work I created the waster to destroy sometimes you just need to wreck tell the devil that is fighting against you hold on just a second you couldn't even create yourself brother Homer loved that little story about you know all the scientists gathered together and telling God that they could create the earth so they had a conversation with God we can do what you did we can create an earth and God said get you own dirt yeah it's your own dirt that devil that torments you he's on the time clock I'm not but he is he's coming to an end that's what he don't like about you you're gonna live when he now live and he don't exist I want you to get it I'm getting to an end I want you to get it tell the devil I'm gonna be here when you got you told my sin yard you can never get laid off from this job nobody can pluck you out of the hands of God you are secure as Jesus is secure Lord glory my brother walked into a company in Missouri and he had to hear a job one time it was called a hatchet job to worry that he went to company sin and he would go on inconspicuously and be the man that was getting ready to clean the company out and so one day he went into this company in Missouri and he was walking through and they was giving him a terrible time for being there they talked to him viciously they gave him a horrible time that day you see he was there he was like an art angel unaware he was picking them a new precedent he was picking them a new boss over the whole thing and his job was to get rid of all the top-notch and at the end of the day all those guys that gave him a hard time they was all sitting in a great big room and he said today you had an opportunity you actually had a job interview and you that gave me a hard time are out of a job pack your bags and go home I'm having way too much fun with it because I can see all across this audience I wish God send that man to my company I got some people and I want him to go in their office to call Church what about you God brother on that was vicious that was his job glad I didn't have it are you with me those companies are prosperous but they were bankrupt at that point and he went in and got rid of the dirt Oh hallelujah that's what Jesus did he went that into hell and he took the keys to the kingdom and he's going to tell the devil I don't need you no mo I don't need you I'm trying to get you to get something I'm taking this analogy to get you to get something he's tormented you and he stays in your home I know some of you don't like it or not but you know I personally hate lazy I hate lazy I absolutely hate lazy if you want to know what brother Ron hates Nikki hey ziwei I hate lazy go ahead and spell it with me al hey Z Wow

the right audience may be out there in the land they might get mad at but I got a feeling I'm alright here I always meant said the devil moves into your house he paying your house payment here paying your car payment hearing paying your grocery bill somebody ought to help me preach right here he ain't paying no insurance he paying your taxes and it says right there on your couch and makes fun of you [Applause] this might make you mad said we live in a society where we've got kids 35 years old that they never hit a nickel they never worked a day in their life and they expect their parents to take care of them and watch over them and be over top of them and they can sit there and grumble and complain I know John Locke's Eccles he's been a worker all of his life we believe it we believe work I'm sorry this is my pet peeve this is my bucket I just so happened to be on it yes I'm eating a mint trying to get myself back to where I need to be here for a moment I walked into Starbucks the other day with with my family here it was a man sitting there he had borrowed the pen to write his sign out look like a well label body boy how hungry he was the same place that he borrowed to cite the pen was there was a sign that said Help Wanted he reached across to help walnuts sign to get the pen it took Matthew right over here just leave him alone there it took that guy right there that can't keep me from telling that boy you reached across what you need but I want victory in my life I want healing in my life I want the glory of God in my life don't reach across what you need I'm doing myself I'm doing my best behavior right here I got a million thoughts coming in my direction it's kind of like people that come in after they're saved for two weeks they know how to run the business they know how to do my job out for two weeks now if you really want to make me laugh it's telling me how to do my job I told you Matthew here we go it's that honey badger it's that honey badger I don't find great big Devils for all of these years I'm going on 40 years of preaching and I don't fault Devils I've seen people come out of wheelchairs I've seen cancers delivered the dead raised some of the worst heathen in the world come and be real sons and daughters of God I've seen the worst of the worst raised up out of the galleys and the gutters and homeless situations have become real sons of God and become active members presidents of companies and become top-line citizens of the United States and and China and overseas I've seen people rise from the dire and become presidents of their own companies I've seen God do incredible things absolutely sovereign incredible things I stood with a man in China and we were standing in a little loose place and it was just a narrow place and he had a misson said the head that had literally fell apart for years over and over again and he had put incredible amount of energies decades of energy into this business and he's work and he's an incredible worker and if you saw his hands you can see the calluses on his hands and he's a real servant of God if you if you needed a cup of water he'd run to the moon to get you a cup of water if he had to he's a kind of a fella that's right there with you picked up your bag I preached I preached around him and listened he I've never carried my bag around I'm not asking you to do that but if I'm if I'm walking to a pulpit he'll grab my bag and carry my back but I'm standing in the spot and I said just a moment I feel the Holy Ghost I said God wants to bless your business wants to bless your Chinese partner here he wants to bless your business but he wants to bless your business and tell where you can't even hardly believe of how much that he's blessing your business I got a letter two weeks ago I got a letter two weeks ago said brother on you won't believe how much I cannot explain to you it is beyond fathom to believe how much God has blessed my business come on church if God is your partner if God is your partner if God is your partner you better have big plans but it takes incredible courage for you to believe who you are it takes courage for you to believe who you are I'm coming to an end what God deposited on the inside of you he wants you to live God has a purpose for you in your life but every time that you get at the devil will whisper in your ear hindering thoughts and unbelieving thoughts and remind you of who you used to be but remind him a lot Batman know [Applause] little lady I don't even know your name but I want to tell you if you ever

99 percent he's a big enough God to take care of the hundreds percent [Applause] Oh he's a great big guy let me just finish with this I'd went to have coffee at the coffee shop in Switzerland and I set with the ministers some deacons are sitting there said are we gonna have a prayer line tonight and I said I don't know I haven't been given the instructions yet we're coming toward service time we've only got a few hours left we're coming towards service time as ministers we just wait on what God does wants to do because I can't do anything and I went into that room and I can't remember exactly which one it was it was old nine and I can't remember what floor I was on two or three and I walked into that room and I got down on my knees and I began to pray and it was a little bit you can always have he's ever been in the room when you know you ain't alone all the sudden you know he you ain't alone no more you was alone a few minutes ago between alone now and I felt him in the room and the Lord spoke to me it was interesting instructions tonight before you even preached I want you to tell the audience make a list make a list of your needs write them down that's the petition before God and go to answer your prayers sometimes we have to get courage just to write it down because it takes some it takes some it takes some faith this is more than a wishing so come on Church it's more than a wishing so you remember when brother Branham was said in there with Hattie right he was telling her a story about creativity of those squirrels that's what he was doing he was telling her about the spoken word come into existence of the third bull and he was simply sitting there on a normal day talking about supernatural things that had not been given to man before and he was sitting there and he was telling her how the squirrels came into existence and he was just conversating with her he brought her he brought her some milk and some meat and some things and she responded that's absolutely the truth brother Branham and she responded that's absolutely the truth and the angel of the Lord responded give her what she wants are you in the mega list mega list give it what she wants and brother branham cautioned her she could have got generational wealth she could have got healing for her sister that had been set in as a nimble at all of her life but she asked for the greater part the salvation of her two boys now this is an action service what are you gonna ask for what are you gonna ask for sister Wanda did you get what you asked for I'd say you did what you asked for I like doing business with God that says I'm gonna meet your need and you know that there's not a devil in hell can stop it from happening Greg we're a long way down the road now buddy buddy's a long time but I sit in the office with you when everything looked impossible any good you couldn't have a better son you couldn't have a better situation what you got right now sitting on a front row there's people in hell give good money to set there you can't you can't Holly have it much better than this bus Steve I wouldn't trade this for all the money in the world let's just talk to him for a little while Jason you know that when you go to work and you're running that equipment that the angels of God that was there with you that preserved your life they're going with you every day to work and he's proved he'd be faithful to you at that spot and he preserved you and told you get out of that hole now that God's just not temporary and he wasn't there just for a day or two or
