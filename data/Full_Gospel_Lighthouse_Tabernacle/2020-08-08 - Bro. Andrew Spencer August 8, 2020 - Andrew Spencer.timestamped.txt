[47:22] we
[47:24] when things go wrong

[47:49] oh he's
[47:52] the man's house
[48:07] he's still gone in the night
[48:26] amen aren't you glad to be serving a god
[48:30] that is always the same amen it's good
[48:34] to be here in the house of lord this
[48:35] evening
[48:36] and and to greet you this way and uh
[48:39] to all those that are listening by the
[48:40] way the internet we greet you today in
[48:42] the name of the lord
[48:44] and uh happy to have each and every one
[48:45] of you here
[48:47] our hearts were a bit a bit saddened
[48:49] today when we
[48:50] got the news on sister sue comer but for
[48:53] sister sue's case
[48:55] death was a friend and when we get to
[48:58] that spot of
[48:59] life and you know i'm so thankful that
[49:01] there's a way to get out of these old
[49:02] pest houses and
[49:05] we may lose our mind and we may lose
[49:07] different things of aspects of
[49:09] life but it does not change that
[49:11] predestinated seed on the inside of us
[49:14] and
[49:15] and so we just want to be remembering
[49:17] the family there and
[49:19] the reason there's no funeral is it's
[49:21] just too hard during these times of
[49:23] covet
[49:24] that we're not able to have a funeral so
[49:26] a graveside is
[49:27] is what is suited for this time and so
[49:30] we just
[49:30] they still require us to do the social
[49:32] distancing and things
[49:34] and uh we've been a part of a few of
[49:36] these gravesides here in the
[49:37] last little bit and it seemed to go well
[49:40] and
[49:41] and we just pray that the lord will come
[49:43] and just
[49:44] meet us there and we just want to thank
[49:48] the lord for his protecting hand
[49:50] upon us this week we had

[55:32] don't trust me just ask the blind man
[55:36] amen
[55:41] isaiah chapter 59 and verse 15
[55:46] yea truth faileth and he that departeth
[55:49] from evil
[55:51] maketh himself a prey and the lord saw
[55:53] it
[55:54] and it displeased him that there was no
[55:56] judgment
[55:57] and he saw that there was no man and
[56:00] wondered that there was no intercessor
[56:03] therefore his
[56:04] arm brought salvation unto him
[56:07] and his righteousness it sustained him
[56:10] for he put on righteousness as a
[56:12] breastplate and a helmet of salvation
[56:14] upon his head
[56:16] and he put on the garments of vengeance
[56:18] for clothing
[56:19] and was clad with zeal as a cloak
[56:22] according to their deeds accordingly he
[56:25] will repay
[56:26] fury to his adversaries and recompense
[56:29] to
[56:30] his enemies to the islands he will repay
[56:33] recompense i mean he has a need that

[56:58] mighty hand of god that has been upon us

[57:01] another time
[57:03] that we could come to the house of god

[58:25] things
[58:26] amen god bless you you may be seated in
[58:29] the presence of the lord
[58:32] i'd like to i'd like to speak to you
[58:35] along
[58:36] the lines that we spoke last weekend i
[58:38] was we spoke to you last weekend
[58:41] or on on when god dresses for war and
[58:43] i'd like to speak to you by the help of
[58:45] the lord
[58:46] on the lamb declaring war and
[58:49] when we when we went through that last
[58:51] weekend
[58:52] we went through as god dressed himself
[58:55] for war and he
[58:56] and he put on the garments of vengeance
[58:58] and all of these things and
[59:00] and we see that that god dressed himself
[59:03] in the
[59:04] in the robe of humanity and he gave
[59:06] himself for you and i
[59:07] that that you and i could stand here in
[59:10] the liberty where christ
[59:12] has made us free and and what god has
[59:15] given to us in this
[59:16] hour is is not a weapon that is carnal
[59:19] he has not given us
[59:20] a he's not giving us of uh of a weak
[59:23] weapon but he gave us himself
[59:25] and the material that the church has got
[59:28] it is
[59:29] it's a mighty weapon and and there's
[59:31] never been one like it in
[59:33] all the world he because he gave us
[59:36] he gave us the best thing that he could
[59:39] have given us
[59:40] when he gave us his word and you see
[59:42] when he came
[59:44] he he came and he humbled himself down
[59:47] the the almighty god as he as he left
[59:51] the throne of glory
[59:53] and and he he left the splendor of
[59:56] heaven
[59:56] that the almighty god came to came to us
[1:00:00] in such a humiliating way
[1:00:02] that the men of the day missed it and
[1:00:05] still many people miss it even to this
[1:00:07] day
[1:00:08] he was born in a manger and he came
[1:00:11] and he came to use the weapon
[1:00:14] of love to love and that love conquered
[1:00:17] the world
[1:00:18] he didn't come he didn't come with an
[1:00:20] army with an army to bring bullets he
[1:00:23] didn't come with machine guns
[1:00:25] he didn't come with tanks he didn't come
[1:00:27] with all of the things of weaponries of
[1:00:30] men
[1:00:31] but he came with a weapon of love and he
[1:00:33] came in that way
[1:00:35] and he came in such a way that that men
[1:00:38] missed the very great i am as he came in
[1:00:42] that way
[1:00:43] and we we we see it so many times that
[1:00:46] even still today that
[1:00:47] that many overlook this great weapon of
[1:00:50] love
[1:00:51] it's amazing what love can do that love
[1:00:54] conquers all things
[1:00:56] that love is is such a very powerful
[1:00:59] force that
[1:01:00] that love will make you do extreme
[1:01:03] things
[1:01:04] you you see what the love of god did it
[1:01:07] made him leave the throne of mercy
[1:01:10] it made him leave heaven as we would say
[1:01:14] to make him and make himself a body that
[1:01:17] he would be
[1:01:18] bruised in that he would be scarred in
[1:01:20] so that he could feel like
[1:01:22] you feel and understand like you
[1:01:24] understand
[1:01:25] because he wanted to understand the
[1:01:28] things that you're going through
[1:01:30] but so many people were looking for for
[1:01:33] a great general and looking for
[1:01:35] for a great man with a with a genius
[1:01:38] mind to come and set everything in order
[1:01:41] but we look and what did god send to us
[1:01:44] he sent us a lamb
[1:01:46] he sent us a lamb and we look over in
[1:01:49] matthew
[1:01:50] 3 when we see the spirit of god
[1:01:52] descending upon him
[1:01:54] when the dove descends upon the lamb and
[1:01:57] it shows
[1:01:58] us that the lead that the dove is
[1:02:01] leading the lamb
[1:02:02] and it has to be the same way in the
[1:02:05] church today
[1:02:06] that if the dove does not lead you if
[1:02:09] you are not impelled by that leadership
[1:02:12] of the holy spirit
[1:02:13] you will be led off into some odd thing
[1:02:16] or
[1:02:17] let off into some carnal thing or let
[1:02:20] off in the things of the world
[1:02:21] but the dove of the holy spirit will
[1:02:25] not lead you into things of man or not
[1:02:28] lead you into things of carnality
[1:02:30] and you may sin and you may you may do
[1:02:33] something and you may offend god but
[1:02:35] brother branham would tell us
[1:02:37] he would tell us that when you sin that
[1:02:40] dove don't go very far away
[1:02:42] he said that dove would go up and maybe
[1:02:44] sit on a branch right there
[1:02:46] and when you repent of your sins that
[1:02:49] that dove of the holy spirit
[1:02:51] will come right back down and land upon
[1:02:53] your shoulder
[1:02:54] so we realize that when you go to
[1:02:56] confess in your sins
[1:02:58] that the dove of the spirit begins to
[1:03:00] move to you
[1:03:01] and gums begins to coo towards you
[1:03:06] we look over in revelations chapter 5
[1:03:09] and when you see
[1:03:10] john as he was weeping there at john
[1:03:12] being a type of the bride of jesus
[1:03:14] christ and
[1:03:15] and you you were seen you were seen
[1:03:18] weeping there if you can put yourself
[1:03:19] there
[1:03:20] because if you would look at it and you
[1:03:22] look at all the sin and
[1:03:24] all the sin of humanity that was stacked
[1:03:26] up there and you
[1:03:27] and you saw your name on that book and
[1:03:30] you looked there on that book and then
[1:03:32] there was not one found worthy
[1:03:35] throughout heaven and throughout the
[1:03:37] earth
[1:03:37] it would make you weep it would make you
[1:03:41] feel
[1:03:42] a sorrow on the inside of your on the
[1:03:45] inside of your soul
[1:03:46] it would leave such a pit of despair on
[1:03:48] the inside of you
[1:03:50] that it would leave you troubled but as
[1:03:53] john was
[1:03:54] weeping there was an elder that stood up
[1:03:56] and said weep not john
[1:03:58] for the lion of the tribe of judah hath
[1:04:01] prevailed hallelujah
[1:04:03] here was the worthy one and when john
[1:04:07] turned around to see he turned around to
[1:04:10] see a lion
[1:04:11] but when he turned he didn't see a lion
[1:04:13] but he's seen a lamb
[1:04:16] oh there's many a times when the line of
[1:04:18] the word comes out
[1:04:20] and he calls out your sin and calls out
[1:04:22] who you are and
[1:04:23] calls out the wrongs of your life but
[1:04:25] when you go to turn to him
[1:04:27] you don't see a line but you see the
[1:04:29] lamb of god
[1:04:32] it's the mercies of god that has renewed
[1:04:35] your strength
[1:04:36] it is the joy of the lord that has made
[1:04:38] you strong and it is
[1:04:40] the lamb's mercy to you
[1:04:44] that has placed you in a position to
[1:04:47] receive the word
[1:04:48] of the hour hallelujah
[1:04:52] but when john turned to see that lamb
[1:04:56] that lamb was seen as a bloody lamb
[1:05:01] that lamb had been in battle that lamb
[1:05:03] had been wounded in battle
[1:05:05] and he was bloody all over because he'd
[1:05:09] been in battle and what was he in battle
[1:05:11] for you
[1:05:13] he was in battle for me but i want you
[1:05:15] to know that when john looked to see
[1:05:17] that lamb
[1:05:18] that lamb was not dead but that lamb was
[1:05:20] living
[1:05:22] hallelujah he's ever living he's not
[1:05:25] changing he's still remaining and the
[1:05:28] lamb of god is still setting
[1:05:31] on the throne tonight there's still
[1:05:34] blood on the mercy seat i know a lot of
[1:05:36] people want to take the blood off the
[1:05:39] mercy seat
[1:05:40] but if you take the blood off the mercy
[1:05:42] seat you're as guilty
[1:05:44] as guilty can be oh hallelujah but there
[1:05:48] is a blood that washes away all of your
[1:05:51] sins
[1:05:52] that lamb when he went to fight for you
[1:05:55] he didn't leave anything
[1:05:57] undone he went all the way he don't have
[1:05:59] to pay for your sins no more
[1:06:02] he don't have to be beat no more and i
[1:06:04] want to tell you church you ain't got to
[1:06:06] beat yourself
[1:06:10] hallelujah you ain't going to put
[1:06:12] yourself through purgatory
[1:06:14] and repla try to pay for all the
[1:06:16] generational sins
[1:06:18] that's been passed down throughout your
[1:06:20] genealogies that's already been stripped
[1:06:23] off
[1:06:24] that's already been taken care of
[1:06:27] because the lamb
[1:06:28] was declaring war against sin
[1:06:32] who but he wasn't just declaring war on
[1:06:35] sin
[1:06:36] he was declaring war on your freedom
[1:06:39] because everything that was holding you
[1:06:42] bound
[1:06:43] when the devil tried to put his dirty
[1:06:46] hands upon your life
[1:06:49] the owner took the book
[1:06:53] oh hallelujah when adam fell
[1:06:56] satan tried to put his dirty hands upon
[1:06:59] your life
[1:07:00] but what happened the owner stood up and
[1:07:03] said that's mine
[1:07:06] he's got a he's got a now satan's got a
[1:07:09] claim
[1:07:09] he's got a claim on this earth he's got
[1:07:12] a claim on the kingdoms of this earth
[1:07:15] and as you all you see what satan tried
[1:07:17] to do
[1:07:18] he tried to give this kingdom
[1:07:22] he tried to give all the kingdoms to
[1:07:24] jesus
[1:07:26] but jesus was not willing just to take
[1:07:29] it
[1:07:29] jesus said no sir i'm going to buy this
[1:07:34] oh hallelujah you know something when
[1:07:37] somebody gives you something
[1:07:39] when somebody gives you something
[1:07:41] sometimes you don't appreciate it
[1:07:43] but when you buy something when you put
[1:07:46] your money in the product whoo help me
[1:07:49] preach
[1:07:50] when you put your money in the product
[1:07:52] that you want
[1:07:54] it means something to you and
[1:07:57] jesus is saying that you mean
[1:08:00] something to him you see
[1:08:04] satan was wanting to give jesus a
[1:08:07] kingdom without a calvary
[1:08:11] oh hallelujah that's the same thing that
[1:08:13] satan wants to do to you today
[1:08:15] he wants to give you he wants to give
[1:08:17] you the holy ghost
[1:08:18] without you going through calvary that's
[1:08:20] what the world out here wants to offer
[1:08:22] you
[1:08:23] is some holy religion that'll make you
[1:08:25] live right when you're in church
[1:08:27] but it won't make you live right when
[1:08:29] you're outside a church
[1:08:39] oh no i'm gonna purchase that that means
[1:08:42] something to me
[1:08:44] and i want you to know he's still
[1:08:46] fighting for you
[1:08:48] look at your neighbor say he's still
[1:08:49] fighting for me
[1:08:53] you see when the lamb stood up
[1:08:56] he was saying that i am strong enough
[1:09:00] i have done the kinsmen work
[1:09:05] there ain't nobody else in heaven and
[1:09:07] there ain't nobody else in earth there's
[1:09:09] no angels
[1:09:11] there's no principalities there's not
[1:09:13] anybody
[1:09:14] on earth or in heaven that is strong
[1:09:18] enough to do this
[1:09:19] but the lamb is saying i'm worthy enough
[1:09:22] i'm good enough i'm strong enough he was
[1:09:26] saying brother standing
[1:09:27] i'm worthy enough for your cause i'm
[1:09:30] worthy enough for your cause brother
[1:09:32] nathaniel
[1:09:32] i'm worthy enough for ron's picture
[1:09:36] i'm worthy enough to take everything
[1:09:39] that was
[1:09:40] laid upon you i'm worthy enough to take
[1:09:46] this
[1:09:50] satan ain't going to like this one now
[1:09:53] the bible says in first corinthians 14
[1:09:55] and 8
[1:09:57] that if the trumpet give an uncertain
[1:09:59] sound
[1:10:00] who shall prepare himself to battle
[1:10:06] you see if the trumpet is giving out an
[1:10:09] unscriptural sound in the day
[1:10:11] no man can prepare himself for laodicean
[1:10:14] h but you know that when you look
[1:10:17] at the trumpet that came and you look it
[1:10:20] was not an uncertain
[1:10:21] sound when it was sounding through the
[1:10:23] voice of jesus
[1:10:25] it was certain you could be certain of
[1:10:27] those things you could be certain of
[1:10:29] what he said
[1:10:30] lazarus was certain of it
[1:10:33] he knew that there was nothing uncertain
[1:10:35] of it when he was down there in
[1:10:38] in the grave and down there spinning
[1:10:40] around in a world that we don't know
[1:10:41] exactly where he was at
[1:10:43] but he was down there fellowshipping
[1:10:45] with the saints of old
[1:10:47] but all of a sudden there came a voice
[1:10:49] from another world that said
[1:10:51] lazarus come forth now there may have
[1:10:54] been men that was praying for laughter
[1:10:56] say
[1:10:56] praying for his family but last was not
[1:11:01] but when this one stood up it was more
[1:11:03] than him just praying for it
[1:11:05] but there was a voice from another world
[1:11:08] that said i'm calling you out of this
[1:11:11] world back into this world
[1:11:14] there has been a voice that has screamed
[1:11:16] out in this hour that is calling you out
[1:11:18] of laodicea
[1:11:19] and pulling you up in the heavenly
[1:11:21] places in you
[1:11:22] what you choose or what god has chosen
[1:11:25] to be in
[1:11:30] well this trumpet that we've heard in
[1:11:32] this day
[1:11:34] it's a scriptural sound and there ain't
[1:11:37] nothing uncertain about the sound that
[1:11:39] we've heard
[1:11:40] this trumpet voice has sounded and the
[1:11:43] bride of jesus christ
[1:11:45] has prepared herself
[1:11:48] the bride will go through wars she will
[1:11:51] go through
[1:11:52] she will go through temptations she will
[1:11:54] go through trials
[1:11:56] but she will not falter
[1:12:00] she will not buckle under the pressure
[1:12:02] because there has been a sounding go
[1:12:04] forth
[1:12:05] that has declared to her the word of
[1:12:08] this
[1:12:08] hour and she's prepared herself for
[1:12:11] battle
[1:12:12] now jesus told her for otis told us over
[1:12:15] in matthew 24
[1:12:17] in six he said you shall hear of wars
[1:12:20] and rumors of wars
[1:12:22] he said see that you be not troubled
[1:12:26] for all these things must come to pass
[1:12:29] but the end is not yet
[1:12:31] now brother branham preached this up in
[1:12:33] the first seal and he says
[1:12:34] he said wars and rumors of wars he said
[1:12:38] but
[1:12:38] trumpet denotes political disturbances
[1:12:41] whereas seals deals with a religious
[1:12:43] disturbance you see
[1:12:45] and a seal is open and a message is
[1:12:47] dropped and the church is always
[1:12:49] so set up in its own political ways and
[1:12:51] whatever more
[1:12:53] and of his dignitary and when that when
[1:12:55] that real
[1:12:56] message drops that messenger goes forth
[1:12:59] and he shakes them to pieces he said
[1:13:02] that's right it's a religious
[1:13:04] disturbance
[1:13:05] when a seal is open that's what's
[1:13:07] happened you watch when every time a
[1:13:09] trumpet is sounded
[1:13:10] that when the messenger of the day goes
[1:13:13] forth that that trumpet is denoting war
[1:13:17] and when paul the first messenger went
[1:13:20] forth
[1:13:20] he was declaring war on the on the
[1:13:23] orthodox church
[1:13:26] and when you see wesley going forth he
[1:13:28] was declaring war
[1:13:30] on the message of the day of yesterday
[1:13:34] when they were saying that there was no
[1:13:36] more work of the holy ghost
[1:13:38] that he was declaring war that there was
[1:13:41] a second work of grace
[1:13:43] that there was a sanctification that was
[1:13:47] that was coming it was a second work of
[1:13:49] god's grace
[1:13:51] and you can relate to this maybe even a
[1:13:53] little bit more
[1:13:54] that when the seventh messenger when it
[1:13:56] came in this
[1:13:57] hour he was declaring war on the
[1:14:00] laodicean age
[1:14:01] and he blasted against that layout of
[1:14:03] sea and age
[1:14:06] there was nothing uncertain about this
[1:14:08] scriptural sound
[1:14:10] but he was not to bring forth and he was
[1:14:13] not had a certain mystery that he was to
[1:14:15] declare
[1:14:16] but what he did that seventh angel
[1:14:19] gathered up
[1:14:19] all all of those mysteries that's been
[1:14:22] lost
[1:14:22] in them ages he was to finish
[1:14:27] all the mysteries of god
[1:14:31] again in the sixth seal he said trumpets
[1:14:34] always denote war and the messenger the
[1:14:36] angel came on the earth
[1:14:38] and the messenger of the hour like
[1:14:40] luther's
[1:14:41] like any of the messengers that we've
[1:14:43] talked of what did he do
[1:14:44] what does he do he arrives and a seal
[1:14:47] open
[1:14:48] reveals a trumpet sound and a war is
[1:14:51] declared
[1:14:52] and away they go and then the messenger
[1:14:55] dies he seals away this group
[1:14:57] they're put in and a plague falls upon
[1:15:00] those who rejected it
[1:15:02] and then it goes on and they organize
[1:15:04] and get another organization
[1:15:06] now notice then here they come out
[1:15:10] with another power see another power of
[1:15:13] another age
[1:15:14] uh another age of the church another
[1:15:16] ministry
[1:15:17] and then when he does that along comes
[1:15:19] god with his ministry
[1:15:21] when the antichrist comes with his the
[1:15:24] anti is against
[1:15:25] they run side by side
[1:15:28] now he said i want you to notice a
[1:15:30] little something just about the time
[1:15:32] that cain came on the earth abel came on
[1:15:35] the earth
[1:15:36] i want you to notice just about the time
[1:15:38] that christ came on the earth
[1:15:40] judas came on the earth about the time
[1:15:43] that christ came
[1:15:44] that christ went off the earth judas
[1:15:47] went off the earth
[1:15:48] and just about the time that the holy
[1:15:50] spirit fell the antichrist spirit fell
[1:15:53] and just about the time the holy ghost
[1:15:55] is revealing himself here in the last
[1:15:57] days
[1:15:57] the antichrist is showing his colors
[1:16:00] coming through
[1:16:00] these politics and things
[1:16:04] and just about the time the antichrist
[1:16:06] moves
[1:16:07] himself fully on the scene god
[1:16:10] moves himself fully
[1:16:14] to redeem his own
[1:16:17] when the antichrist is coming on the
[1:16:19] scene
[1:16:20] god is moving himself to redeem his own
[1:16:33] you see wherever the word of god is
[1:16:37] the enemy is close by
[1:16:40] are you with me i want you to know that
[1:16:42] the enemy's real close by tonight
[1:16:45] you see he ain't got a clue he ain't got
[1:16:48] a clue
[1:16:49] until it gets released until the trumpet
[1:16:52] sounds
[1:16:53] he ain't got a clue about it he's not
[1:16:55] omnipresent
[1:16:56] neither is he omniscient but when that
[1:17:00] seal is released when that trumpet goes
[1:17:03] forth
[1:17:03] then he goes and he tries to pervert
[1:17:05] those saints
[1:17:07] oh hallelujah you watch as christ comes
[1:17:10] down
[1:17:10] you have yourself a jubilee tonight
[1:17:15] and you'll go out and you'll fight
[1:17:17] against the antichrist tomorrow
[1:17:21] you'll feel on top of the world tonight
[1:17:23] and you'll feel
[1:17:24] down in a valley tomorrow but does that
[1:17:28] change the word does it change your
[1:17:31] predestination
[1:17:33] does it change the move of god it just
[1:17:36] shows you that the spirit of christ is
[1:17:38] here
[1:17:39] and the spirit of the antichrist is
[1:17:41] warned against
[1:17:42] the the move of god
[1:17:48] this even moses moses was that close
[1:17:53] and pharaoh missed it
[1:17:57] now the devil's slick but he's dumb
[1:18:01] because moses was raised right under the
[1:18:05] nose of pharaoh
[1:18:08] and he's had his hand he's had his hand
[1:18:12] upon
[1:18:12] a lot of you young people and he's tried
[1:18:15] to keep you
[1:18:17] but what he don't realize is that there
[1:18:19] is a predestinated seed
[1:18:21] that's laying there that he can't stop
[1:18:25] you've been risen in this hour right
[1:18:28] under the nose of the devil
[1:18:34] what he thought he was doing to you is
[1:18:37] just bringing about a greater victory
[1:18:42] hallelujah you see moses had to come
[1:18:45] forth to produce the word of the hour
[1:18:50] you see moses was predestinated to be
[1:18:53] there but there was a seed that had to
[1:18:55] come forth
[1:18:57] and when moses was was brought up on the
[1:19:00] scene
[1:19:01] you watch as soon as that ministry of
[1:19:03] moses go forth
[1:19:05] you watch that antichrist move begin to
[1:19:08] attach itself
[1:19:09] and try to war against the move of god
[1:19:13] you remember when moses as soon as he
[1:19:15] goes into pharaoh's courts
[1:19:17] that moses throws down his rod and he
[1:19:20] becomes a snake
[1:19:21] but you watch as those magicians and
[1:19:23] those philosophers
[1:19:25] they put down their sticks and they
[1:19:27] tried
[1:19:28] to contest against the god of moses
[1:19:35] now this is amazing to me there's not
[1:19:38] one time in the old testament when the
[1:19:41] names of these philosophers has ever
[1:19:43] spoken
[1:19:45] when the name of these magicians it's
[1:19:47] never spoken
[1:19:49] but when you go over in a second timothy
[1:19:51] chapter 3
[1:19:52] you find out the name of those
[1:19:54] philosophers the name of those magicians
[1:19:57] and the paul tells us that we're just
[1:20:00] like
[1:20:01] janice and jamery's withstood moses
[1:20:04] these in this hour resisted the truth of
[1:20:07] god
[1:20:11] oh my goodness i i just if you knew
[1:20:14] where i was going just now
[1:20:15] you'd go ahead and come up on this
[1:20:17] pulpit and help me preach
[1:20:20] you see all throughout the old testament
[1:20:24] the enemy thought that he'd got by
[1:20:26] without the lord calling out their names
[1:20:30] but when he got over in the new
[1:20:31] testament when all the mysteries was
[1:20:34] being revealed
[1:20:35] god did not forget the names of the
[1:20:38] demons
[1:20:40] that withstood moses and resisted the
[1:20:44] truth
[1:20:47] hallelujah god does not forget the enemy
[1:20:51] that has contested you
[1:20:53] and god will not forget the spirit of
[1:20:55] hell that has attacked you
[1:20:58] that has attacked this bride god will
[1:21:00] not forget cancer
[1:21:02] god will not forget criticism god will
[1:21:05] not forget depression
[1:21:06] god will not forget complexes
[1:21:10] god will not forget suicide god will not
[1:21:13] forget
[1:21:14] it but there is a lamb that is declaring
[1:21:18] war
[1:21:19] on the devil
[1:21:23] hallelujah you see about the time the
[1:21:25] antichrist moves his cell phone then god
[1:21:28] moves himself in
[1:21:29] to redeem his own
[1:21:34] hallelujah now notice
[1:21:38] over in revelations chapter 17 i'm going
[1:21:40] to need some more up here brothers don't
[1:21:41] let me blast them but let me
[1:21:43] let me have a little bit more i got some
[1:21:46] meat to throw at you
[1:21:51] the bible says here in revelation 17 at
[1:21:54] 14 and we look that we can look back
[1:21:56] and we could see throughout this
[1:21:58] scripture throughout revelations chapter
[1:22:00] 17
[1:22:01] we look and we see the mother of harlots
[1:22:03] we see that great that sets
[1:22:05] herself upon
[1:22:06] the seven hills and brother branham said
[1:22:09] that you'd have to be death blind and
[1:22:10] dumb not to know who that is
[1:22:12] and you look at those kings that were
[1:22:14] there that the ones that gave
[1:22:16] power over to the beast and brother
[1:22:18] bannon said that those were
[1:22:19] those were dictators in that hour and
[1:22:22] notice what verse 14
[1:22:24] says that these these kings shall make
[1:22:27] war with the lamb
[1:22:29] and the lamb shall overcome them for he
[1:22:32] is lord of lords
[1:22:34] and king of kings and they that are with
[1:22:37] him are called
[1:22:38] and chosen and faithful
[1:22:41] that'll make you want us out
[1:22:45] hallelujah those that are with him are
[1:22:48] cold
[1:22:49] they're chosen they're faithful
[1:22:53] he's not saying the is with him
[1:22:56] the kings aren't with him
[1:22:57] rome isn't with him the church world
[1:23:00] isn't with him
[1:23:01] politics ain't with him but they that
[1:23:04] are with the lamb
[1:23:07] are called are chosen are faithful
[1:23:13] hallelujah all things work together for
[1:23:16] the good to them

[1:23:23] called not only are you called you're
[1:23:25] justified
[1:23:26] not only you're justified you're
[1:23:28] glorified
[1:23:31] the lamb is standing
[1:23:35] up for the cold
[1:23:37] [Applause]
[1:23:39] oh i love that i'm with him
[1:23:43] i'm with the lamb and if i'm with the
[1:23:46] lamb brother william it tells me i'm
[1:23:48] cold

[1:23:51] chosen

[1:23:58] if i'm with the lamb
[1:24:01] i'm faithful
[1:24:07] sure you got ward on that this week sure
[1:24:11] you battled on that this week
[1:24:14] did that change god's mind about his
[1:24:17] word
[1:24:18] concerning you
[1:24:22] yes yes the enemy is going to face you
[1:24:27] when i watch the spirit of hell stand
[1:24:30] beside a brother this past weekend
[1:24:33] when he stood there and tried to block
[1:24:36] the visitation
[1:24:37] i watched the angel the lord get through
[1:24:42] i didn't tell nobody else about it but i
[1:24:45] watched
[1:24:47] i watched a shadow hang over an
[1:24:49] individual and i watched that shadow get
[1:24:51] broke last weekend
[1:25:02] you see that enemy would like to stand
[1:25:05] over you
[1:25:06] and he tries to block you and hold you
[1:25:08] down with the dead of your past
[1:25:10] but there's a lamb there's a lamb that's
[1:25:14] declaring war on that spirit of hell
[1:25:17] on that spirit of shadow of doubt that's
[1:25:19] trying to
[1:25:20] that that's trying to cause the people
[1:25:22] to disbelieve this truth
[1:25:25] not only is he trying to get them to
[1:25:26] disbelieve this truth he's trying to get
[1:25:28] them to disbelieve me
[1:25:31] oh you see if he can get you to
[1:25:33] disbelieve me i can't help you
[1:25:37] but there's a lamb that's declaring war
[1:25:40] on that
[1:25:41] on that spirit that comes out of hell
[1:25:45] whoo i don't have to fight this he's
[1:25:48] fighting my paddles
[1:25:50] you don't know what it's like to stand
[1:25:52] here behind the pulpit and actually see
[1:25:54] that demon of hell
[1:25:55] as he's beginning to chase down somebody
[1:25:59] you don't know what it does to me when i
[1:26:02] stand there and i watch that shadow lead
[1:26:04] some people off
[1:26:05] but what it is to watch that
[1:26:08] shadow get completely demolished when
[1:26:11] the word
[1:26:12] keeps piling word on top of a word
[1:26:14] building cell on top of sale
[1:26:19] those are the things that are to be
[1:26:24] hallelujah what a destiny that we've
[1:26:27] called to
[1:26:29] we were seen before the foundation of
[1:26:32] the world
[1:26:33] now in the invisible union of the bride
[1:26:35] of christ
[1:26:36] the prophet said we all know that the
[1:26:38] modern church in its present condition
[1:26:40] and its present state is in no condition
[1:26:43] to finish up the great commission
[1:26:45] that god gave the church for this day
[1:26:50] we know that the church could not the
[1:26:53] pentecostal church by no means
[1:26:55] by no means could carry out the last day
[1:26:58] message in this present condition
[1:27:00] and he goes on and he says it's going to
[1:27:03] be
[1:27:04] an elected people that's elected for it
[1:27:10] the church world can't carry this
[1:27:12] message
[1:27:13] the girlfriends can't carry this message
[1:27:16] but you can he will be an elected people
[1:27:19] that carry this message
[1:27:20] and here you stand here you stand with
[1:27:24] an open book in your hand
[1:27:25] with a clear deed a clear title deed to
[1:27:28] redemption

[1:27:48] this hour with an open book in your hand
[1:27:50] this book isn't closed this book ain't
[1:27:53] closed all the loose ends have been tied
[1:27:56] up
[1:27:56] all those denominational barriers that
[1:27:58] held the word of god bound
[1:28:00] all the isms of man that were against
[1:28:02] the word and you
[1:28:04] has been struck off the lamb
[1:28:15] the lamb did not step forth
[1:28:18] just to open those seals so that you
[1:28:20] could be another church group
[1:28:22] so that you could have the title a
[1:28:25] message of the hour tacked on you
[1:28:27] he came to reveal the unwritten word
[1:28:31] and to give you a rapturing faith
[1:28:36] oh taste and see
[1:28:39] that the lord is good you see if you

[1:28:46] has to offer let me say this to you if
[1:28:49] you ever taste of this seven course menu
[1:28:52] you'll never taste of those things but
[1:28:54] you'll never be
[1:28:55] satisfied with just one service or just
[1:28:59] one tape
[1:29:00] but you'll always hunger for more
[1:29:03] you'll say every redemptive blessing
[1:29:06] is for me

[1:29:18] of the mighty angel in this day

[1:29:22] had an experience
[1:29:24] yes you had all those things but do you
[1:29:27] realize where you're standing at
[1:29:28] you're standing under the anointing of
[1:29:30] the mighty angel you're not probing into
[1:29:39] it

[1:29:43] you know what you got in your hand and
[1:29:46] you know what to do with it

[1:29:57] the bible said in deuteronomy 30 and 14
[1:29:59] that the word of god is now thee
[1:30:01] even in my mouth and in my heart that
[1:30:03] thou mayest do it
[1:30:06] is that right
[1:30:09] there ain't going to be nothing there
[1:30:12] will be
[1:30:12] nothing that stops your mouth
[1:30:18] you watch satan on the move today he's
[1:30:20] tried to stop
[1:30:21] your mouth
[1:30:24] he's tried to mask your mouth
[1:30:29] he's tried to stop you from speaking
[1:30:32] he's tried to stop
[1:30:34] you from echoing out these testimonies
[1:30:41] satan is doing his worst but he cannot
[1:30:44] stop
[1:30:46] her mouth
[1:30:50] now notice the bible says in revelations
[1:30:53] 19 and 5
[1:30:55] and a voice came out of the throne
[1:30:57] saying praise our god
[1:30:59] all ye his servants and you that fear
[1:31:01] him both small and great and i heard
[1:31:03] as it were the voice of a great
[1:31:05] multitude and as the voice of many
[1:31:08] waters and the voice of a mighty thunder
[1:31:09] and saying hallelujah
[1:31:11] for the lord god omnipotent reigneth
[1:31:15] hallelujah that voice of many waters
[1:31:18] that is the voice
[1:31:19] of the fifo ministry it is the voice of
[1:31:22] the bride's ministry
[1:31:23] that is designed to shake the devil
[1:31:29] you see that's why he's trying to stop
[1:31:31] you he's trying to stop the voice
[1:31:34] that will shake the devil you see
[1:31:37] god is speaking to the church and
[1:31:39] reflecting himself
[1:31:40] through seven spirits and when the true
[1:31:42] anointed of god speaks
[1:31:44] it's the voice of god to reject it is to
[1:31:47] remove the candlestick
[1:31:49] you see voices the voices of the seven
[1:31:51] church ages
[1:31:52] the voice is speaking with thunder and
[1:31:54] lightning nowadays
[1:31:56] we don't believe in saying hell in the
[1:31:58] pulpit no mercy
[1:31:59] we need men of god men who won't hold
[1:32:02] back
[1:32:04] never now everybody can't be a preacher
[1:32:08] but if you got a voice if you're a
[1:32:10] preacher you're called to the pulpit to
[1:32:12] preach
[1:32:13] if you're not you're still a preacher
[1:32:15] but live
[1:32:16] the people a sermon let your sermon be
[1:32:19] lived and if it's the voice of god
[1:32:22] that'll bring reproach to them who
[1:32:24] reject it
[1:32:25] you see they say no one can put a finger
[1:32:29] on his or her life they're sweet
[1:32:32] living if there ever was a man of god
[1:32:36] it's that man or that woman
[1:32:40] see live your
[1:32:44] sermon
[1:32:48] i know it's hard i know it's real hard
[1:32:51] for the make-believer but for a real
[1:32:54] believer
[1:32:55] live your sermon don't try to preach
[1:32:58] them if you're not
[1:32:59] called to preach get all mixed up anyhow
[1:33:02] and messed up
[1:33:03] and you'll get people all tangled up you
[1:33:05] don't you won't know what you'll ruin
[1:33:07] them
[1:33:08] and yourself too just live
[1:33:11] your sermon
[1:33:14] the preacher's called to preach his and
[1:33:17] the leo live it too
[1:33:19] and if you can't live it then stop
[1:33:20] preaching
[1:33:22] but you're supposed to live your sermons
[1:33:31] oh how we need in jeffersonville
[1:33:36] thousands of live voices the thunder of
[1:33:39] god
[1:33:39] thundering out and sweetness and
[1:33:41] holiness and purity
[1:33:43] undefiled lives walking around in the
[1:33:45] earth today without a blemish yes sir
[1:33:48] real christians
[1:33:52] real christians that's
[1:33:56] the thunder against the enemy
[1:34:01] but i thought it was my boastful
[1:34:05] speaking
[1:34:05] on facebook
[1:34:09] i thought it was me being proud about my
[1:34:12] salvation
[1:34:14] and condemning people when i see them
[1:34:16] doing wrong
[1:34:18] that ain't the thunder that scares the
[1:34:20] enemy
[1:34:23] it's that real sweet
[1:34:26] holy purity
[1:34:31] that lived
[1:34:34] i'm gonna get up inside your address i'm
[1:34:36] gonna get in your closet
[1:34:38] and i'm gonna call out all them
[1:34:40] skeletons you got living in there
[1:34:41] and you can try to put on your two-faced
[1:34:44] three-face
[1:34:45] face all you want to but if it ain't a
[1:34:47] live voice
[1:34:49] it will not thunder against the enemy
[1:34:54] oh but if you are on the inside
[1:34:57] and there's something more than you just
[1:35:00] living on the inside of that house
[1:35:03] if there is a real holy ghost move on
[1:35:06] the inside
[1:35:07] that's the thunder against the enemy
[1:35:11] oh come on somebody i got young people
[1:35:13] say oh
[1:35:14] if i could just have one of those yak
[1:35:17] meetings one more time again
[1:35:19] i know that i'd really get it no you
[1:35:21] wouldn't
[1:35:24] if you are counting on one of my youth
[1:35:27] meetings
[1:35:29] you should be here tonight that's who
[1:35:32] i'm preaching to
[1:35:34] the youth
[1:35:37] i believe that we're going to the
[1:35:39] greatest youth camp
[1:35:40] that's ever been
[1:35:48] i can live right i can live right as
[1:35:51] long as i'm around the pastor
[1:35:53] no you can't and you don't think i see
[1:35:57] through that
[1:35:59] now we put brother gabriel inside our
[1:36:01] house cause he's our family
[1:36:03] we wouldn't let anybody just do that
[1:36:06] but do you really think that it was ron
[1:36:09] spencer connie spencer andrew spencer
[1:36:12] that made gabriel get it
[1:36:15] he's not here because he's identified as
[1:36:18] a spencer name
[1:36:20] sure that's who we're going to preach to
[1:36:22] we're going to preach to our family
[1:36:23] who else do you talk to
[1:36:26] right people get mad because because
[1:36:29] message
[1:36:29] churches are family churches well
[1:36:33] in the world would you rather get saved
[1:36:35] than your family
[1:36:37] that's the one you preach to that's the
[1:36:40] one you live this to
[1:36:43] but gabriel didn't get it just because
[1:36:45] he was living
[1:36:46] in the house of ron spencer now it had a
[1:36:48] great big influence
[1:36:50] but the reason why there is a thunder
[1:36:53] against the enemy living there
[1:36:54] it's because it's a live voice
[1:36:57] [Music]
[1:36:59] where where's my yak attack at
[1:37:02] let me preach right here
[1:37:05] reason why satan hates the yak attack
[1:37:09] and those of you that do not understand
[1:37:12] yak
[1:37:13] it's the young adult choir
[1:37:18] now you understand that when
[1:37:22] we get up here it's more than just
[1:37:25] another choir
[1:37:27] but it's a yak that is attacking against
[1:37:30] the devil
[1:37:31] that's trying to destroy
[1:37:41] you can come to my house you can sit
[1:37:44] down
[1:37:45] i can take you through the seals i can
[1:37:47] take you through the church ages
[1:37:48] i can take you through all the quotes as
[1:37:51] all
[1:37:52] if that's all you get
[1:37:55] it's still not a thunder against the
[1:37:58] enemy
[1:37:59] but that real lived
[1:38:03] voice
[1:38:07] i got now i'm a preacher
[1:38:11] i got people that tell me
[1:38:14] they tell me that they're doing this and
[1:38:16] they're doing that and and they're
[1:38:17] they're pointing others to christ
[1:38:19] but their life is pointing in a
[1:38:22] different direction
[1:38:25] so you're trying to talk a good game
[1:38:29] but you're not walking a good game
[1:38:33] are you with me and you see you can
[1:38:36] shout
[1:38:38] you can dance you can holler
[1:38:41] you can scream
[1:38:45] you can get so in the spirit
[1:38:49] of the atmosphere in a church
[1:38:52] and you'll leave here and say man
[1:38:56] i had chills running up and down my back
[1:39:01] i know i got it you better watch him
[1:39:02] chills next time you walk in the freezer
[1:39:05] department you might get a chill
[1:39:09] are you with me it's got to be more than
[1:39:11] a chill running down your back
[1:39:13] it's got to be a baptism of the holy
[1:39:16] ghost
[1:39:18] i have watched some of the best
[1:39:22] potential to get it and they didn't get
[1:39:24] it
[1:39:25] i'm not talking about people here i'm
[1:39:27] talking about people in general
[1:39:28] when you watch people that were that
[1:39:30] close when you look at that
[1:39:32] judas spirit that still lives today but
[1:39:35] when it comes
[1:39:37] to pentecost they show their colors
[1:39:42] what is it it's death
[1:39:45] now i'm planning to say this but it was
[1:39:49] brought to my attention this week so it
[1:39:50] shows
[1:39:51] it shows that i'm right on tune you see
[1:39:54] there's a lot of people
[1:39:56] that want their boogie woogie
[1:40:00] oh i can just
[1:40:03] every time i hear it
[1:40:08] i like that old-time stuff you know
[1:40:12] they say it sues it
[1:40:18] let me tell you you can listen your
[1:40:20] country music
[1:40:22] you can listen your rock and roll you
[1:40:24] say oh i just love hearing that oh
[1:40:26] i don't listen to the bad stuff i listen
[1:40:29] to the good stuff
[1:40:30] let me say this to you if it came from
[1:40:33] the pit of hell
[1:40:34] it came from the pit of hell
[1:40:44] you can listen oh i listened to that old
[1:40:47] country back when things were good you
[1:40:49] know
[1:40:50] you know what i'm saying this back when
[1:40:52] old hank was the tank you know that's
[1:40:54] what i'm talking about
[1:40:55] that's my style you see that was good
[1:40:57] stuff not like this stuff they got today
[1:41:00] you better be careful you're going to
[1:41:01] boogie your woogie your way right on
[1:41:02] into hell
[1:41:03] while we're marching our way into heaven
[1:41:10] get mad at me all you want to but i want
[1:41:12] to see you there
[1:41:17] i've told people this i've told people
[1:41:19] this that people that
[1:41:21] battle devil spirits evil spirits
[1:41:24] you trace it back every time a person
[1:41:27] fights suicide
[1:41:28] you trace it back and you watch what
[1:41:31] they're listening to
[1:41:34] i don't plan to say this for the person
[1:41:37] i don't spoke to this week
[1:41:38] god laid it on my heart two weeks ago to
[1:41:40] say these things
[1:41:41] so i'm not just saying it because it was
[1:41:43] brought to my attention but it showed me
[1:41:46] that it need to be dealt with
[1:41:49] it shows what world
[1:41:52] you're going and pointing to
[1:41:58] but i do believe this i'll tell you to
[1:42:01] get rid of that rock and roll
[1:42:02] i'll tell you get rid of that rap music
[1:42:05] i'll tell you get rid of that tommy rod
[1:42:07] i'll tell you those things but i'm also
[1:42:10] going to tell you
[1:42:11] to replace those things if you take it
[1:42:14] out
[1:42:15] put something better back in you take
[1:42:18] out rap
[1:42:19] put in a good old gospel song
[1:42:26] something that'll not just bring in
[1:42:27] devil spirits but something that'll
[1:42:29] drive them out
[1:42:40] well i got halfway through that quote
[1:42:43] and we got y'all there so let's see
[1:42:45] where the rest of the quote takes us
[1:42:48] and notice he said that's a thunder
[1:42:51] against the enemy
[1:42:52] the devil don't care how loud you can
[1:42:54] holler the devil don't care how much you
[1:42:56] can jump
[1:42:57] how much you can do this or shout but
[1:42:59] what hurts the devil is to see that
[1:43:02] sanctified holy
[1:43:03] consecrated god to god say anything to
[1:43:07] him
[1:43:07] call anything just as sweet as it can be
[1:43:11] and move right on oh my
[1:43:15] that throws him away
[1:43:18] that's the thunder that shakes
[1:43:21] the devil
[1:43:24] hallelujah you see it's your live voice
[1:43:28] that shakes the devil this is a living
[1:43:31] message
[1:43:33] that will defeat satan any time
[1:43:38] anyplace anywhere
[1:43:43] now let me get down here in this warfare
[1:43:46] just for a moment
[1:43:47] brother braham said i had a great
[1:43:49] admiration for general eisenhower
[1:43:51] he said when we're fighting he said when
[1:43:53] we were fighting he said there's many
[1:43:55] times we picked up a shell
[1:43:57] and thrown it into the gun and pulled
[1:43:59] the hammer and let her fall and it
[1:44:00] snapped it didn't go off
[1:44:02] it said we didn't surrender we might
[1:44:04] have put another one in and it snapped
[1:44:06] through we didn't give up said we kept
[1:44:08] on snapping till the one went off
[1:44:10] he said that's the way to win the war
[1:44:13] keep trying
[1:44:14] throw the shell in and pull it you got a
[1:44:16] purpose and a target to hit
[1:44:18] and if it don't go off throw it out and
[1:44:20] throw another one in
[1:44:22] try again throw it in try it again until
[1:44:24] one goes off
[1:44:26] there's one of them there that's alive
[1:44:28] and one of them will go off
[1:44:30] but that's the way we got to do is just
[1:44:33] keep firing away firing away until
[1:44:36] something happens that's the way a
[1:44:39] children of god does
[1:44:41] they stand there and when they stand in
[1:44:44] front of the face of the enemy
[1:44:45] they keep grabbing the promises and they
[1:44:48] keep chucking the shell in
[1:44:50] and said well maybe that one didn't work
[1:44:52] but this one will
[1:44:54] maybe that one didn't work but this one
[1:44:56] will
[1:44:57] you don't give up you don't surrender
[1:45:02] general patton said accept challenges so
[1:45:05] that you may
[1:45:05] feel the exhilaration of victory
[1:45:10] accept those challenges
[1:45:13] hallelujah when winston churchill
[1:45:16] was in the midst of world war ii and
[1:45:19] they had all the politicians
[1:45:21] of europe in a war bunker he made this
[1:45:25] this very prolific speech he said even
[1:45:28] though tracts of europe
[1:45:30] and many old famous states have fallen
[1:45:32] or may fall into the grip of the gestapo
[1:45:35] and all the odious apparatuses of nazi
[1:45:37] rule
[1:45:38] we shall not flag or fail we shall go on
[1:45:41] to the end
[1:45:42] we shall fight in france we shall fight
[1:45:44] on the seas and oceans
[1:45:46] we shall fight with a growing confidence
[1:45:48] and a growing strength in the air
[1:45:50] we shall offend our island whatever the
[1:45:52] cost may be
[1:45:54] we shall fight on the beaches we shall
[1:45:56] fight on the landing grounds we
[1:45:58] shall fight in the fields and in the
[1:45:59] streets we shall fight in the hills
[1:46:02] and we shall never surrender
[1:46:05] never give in never never never
[1:46:08] never in nothing greater small larger
[1:46:11] petty
[1:46:12] never give in
[1:46:20] that was a man that was in a war bunker
[1:46:23] that was
[1:46:24] enthused about his country fighting a
[1:46:27] war
[1:46:28] but let me say and let me prophesy to
[1:46:31] you church of the living god
[1:46:33] we will win this war we will never back
[1:46:36] down
[1:46:36] we will never surrender we will win
[1:46:40] this war
[1:46:48] hallelujah we may fight in the streets
[1:46:51] we might fight in our homes
[1:46:53] we may fight in church but we
[1:46:56] will never surrender
[1:47:03] hallelujah
[1:47:07] possessing the gate of the enemy you
[1:47:09] don't have to conquer it he conquered it
[1:47:11] the other men had to conquer their own
[1:47:13] gate but you don't have to conquer it
[1:47:15] it's already conquered he conquered the
[1:47:17] gate of sickness
[1:47:18] and what did he do when he conquered the
[1:47:20] gate of sickness saying
[1:47:21] that he would whatever you ask on earth
[1:47:24] and whatever you
[1:47:25] bound on earth he would bind it in
[1:47:27] heaven
[1:47:28] and give us the keys to the gate he
[1:47:30] conquered the gate of temptation
[1:47:32] by the word and the key was resist the
[1:47:35] enemy and he will flee from you
[1:47:38] he conquered it all he conquered every
[1:47:40] sickness
[1:47:41] he conquered death he conquered hell he
[1:47:43] conquered death and hell
[1:47:45] he conquered what the others couldn't
[1:47:46] conquer because they are
[1:47:49] of the natural seed this is the
[1:47:51] spiritual seed
[1:47:53] he conquered the gate of the grave and
[1:47:55] rose up on the third day for our
[1:47:57] justification
[1:47:58] and now we are more than conquerors we
[1:48:01] just walk right into it
[1:48:02] as an inheritance we're more than
[1:48:04] conquerors now we are
[1:48:06] dealing with a defeated enemy sickness
[1:48:09] is defeated
[1:48:10] death is defeated hell is defeated
[1:48:13] everything is defeated oh my i wish i
[1:48:16] was twice my size
[1:48:17] now maybe i feel twice as good we are
[1:48:20] disputing
[1:48:21] with a conquered enemy
[1:48:25] when he tells he's going to kill you
[1:48:28] he's already been conquered
[1:48:30] [Applause]
[1:48:31] you know when you've been warned with
[1:48:32] him this week you know he ain't nothing
[1:48:34] but a bluff
[1:48:36] he ain't got no arrows for his own bow
[1:48:39] he ain't got no strength
[1:48:40] all of his power was was stripped by
[1:48:43] jesus christ at calvary
[1:48:47] so when he's telling you you can't
[1:48:49] overcome you remember
[1:48:52] you're disputing with a conquered enemy
[1:48:55] you see if satan can make you believe
[1:48:58] that your weapon is inadequate
[1:48:59] he's got you disarmed
[1:49:05] i had i had a man coming to my house
[1:49:11] from the county this week is coming up
[1:49:14] there and check out some final things on
[1:49:15] my garage i'm building for these young
[1:49:17] people
[1:49:20] so that these young people can have a
[1:49:21] place where they can worship god and
[1:49:23] they can feel safe and secure

[1:49:29] you ever ask
[1:49:30] if i'm not committed to your children
[1:49:32] you've got to be an idiot

[1:49:37] it for your children

[1:50:07] i've only dealt with a certain few
[1:50:11] but after after everything was okay
[1:50:15] he passed everything praise the lord he
[1:50:17] come in he said you know he said when i
[1:50:19] first got up here
[1:50:22] well john we got all kinds of signs
[1:50:30] you'd have to be blind to not see our no
[1:50:33] trespassing signs
[1:50:35] but we got this one sign it said that if
[1:50:38] you can read this sign
[1:50:40] you're in range
[1:50:44] and he said you know he said i didn't
[1:50:46] know what i was getting myself
[1:50:48] into when i was coming back up here
[1:50:51] you really didn't but he said you know
[1:50:54] he said i didn't really know he said
[1:50:56] whether your people is going to pull a
[1:50:57] gun on me i said we don't put them signs
[1:50:59] there for you good people
[1:51:02] we put them there for them idiots that
[1:51:03] want to come up through here and
[1:51:05] just squat on our land see you know
[1:51:09] most of the time it does scare the good
[1:51:11] people
[1:51:13] but it don't scare the people that i
[1:51:15] want to scare it off of
[1:51:19] he's well i didn't really know what i
[1:51:20] was getting myself into
[1:51:22] coming up here i said ah i said i
[1:51:25] wouldn't really pull a gun on you
[1:51:31] but my dogs when they got out the car
[1:51:34] you'd have thought
[1:51:36] they was going to eat his pants off
[1:51:40] you see the difference was i knew they
[1:51:43] wouldn't
[1:51:44] but he didn't
[1:51:51] the truth of it is they probably lick
[1:51:54] you to death before they chew
[1:51:55] on you
[1:51:59] but you know that sign will scare the
[1:52:02] good people but it won't scare the bad
[1:52:03] people
[1:52:05] but i was thinking about that after he
[1:52:06] told me
[1:52:09] it's about time that you hang a sign up
[1:52:11] on your soul
[1:52:14] that you get a good look at satan and

[1:52:57] mediocre devils

[1:58:43] war on your enemy
[1:58:50] that enemy wants your health he wants
[1:58:53] your joy
[1:58:54] but the lamb is declaring that the land
[1:58:56] of the holy ghost is yours
[1:58:59] the lamb is declaring that the land of
[1:59:01] healing is yours
[1:59:02] he's declaring that the land of miracles
[1:59:04] is yours
[1:59:05] he's declaring that the land of signs
[1:59:08] and wonders is yours
[1:59:09] he's declaring that a right mind is
[1:59:11] yours he is declaring that
[1:59:13] all these redemptive blessings that
[1:59:16] flowed down from calvary
[1:59:18] is yours and you hold the title deed of

[1:59:41] i can tell you i can preach to you and
[1:59:44] tell you that it's yours

[1:59:52] the lamb standing for you and the lamb
[1:59:56] is against
[1:59:57] every enemy that raises his head against
[1:59:59] you
[2:00:02] we've heard the trumpet sound so we know
[2:00:05] we're in a warfare
[2:00:07] but our weapons are not carnal
[2:00:10] but mighty and strong and pulling down
[2:00:15] the strongholds of satan
[2:00:20] you remember you remember when the old
[2:00:23] testament and i'm finished
[2:00:25] but i'm finishing with this thought
[2:00:29] that when a man was sold into slavery
[2:00:34] and he had a debt over his head
[2:00:37] he'd been sold into slavery that he had
[2:00:40] to work for thou being her work for that
[2:00:42] man
[2:00:43] until the year a jubilee came
[2:00:47] you see that that that man had been sold
[2:00:50] into slavery
[2:00:52] and he was waiting for the year of
[2:00:54] jubilee to come
[2:00:56] and there was a year there was a year
[2:00:59] that came
[2:01:00] and every seven years it would sound but
[2:01:02] only on the 50th year
[2:01:05] was the jubilee trumpet sounded
[2:01:08] and that man that had been sold into
[2:01:10] slavery
[2:01:12] he was waiting for the sounding of that
[2:01:14] trumpet
[2:01:21] now some of you don't want to some of
[2:01:23] you don't want to hear this trumpet
[2:01:27] but there's somebody that's waiting on
[2:01:28] it
[2:01:31] and it won't offend me it won't offend
[2:01:34] me
[2:01:36] it'll make me lose sleep but it won't
[2:01:38] offend me if you turn down this trumpet
[2:01:42] but when that trumpet sound that man
[2:01:45] that had worked there all those years
[2:01:48] he'd worked side by side with servants
[2:01:51] and those servants was there and they
[2:01:53] was getting their wages for it
[2:01:55] they was getting their wages for working
[2:01:57] in that field but
[2:01:59] this man because of the debt that was
[2:02:01] hanging over him
[2:02:02] he was working in that field and when he
[2:02:05] was working in that field he was staying
[2:02:08] there
[2:02:08] he was staying there until that jubilee
[2:02:12] trumpet
[2:02:13] sounded he was waiting on the trumpet of
[2:02:18] victory to sound
[2:02:20] he was waiting on the trumpet of freedom
[2:02:23] to sound
[2:02:25] now look at we look at me real quick was
[2:02:27] that psalms 137
[2:02:30] it says by the rivers of babylon
[2:02:33] there we sat down yea we wept when we
[2:02:36] remembered zion
[2:02:38] we hang our harps upon the willows in
[2:02:41] the midst thereof
[2:02:43] for there they carried us away captive
[2:02:46] and required of us a song that they
[2:02:50] wasted us
[2:02:51] they wasted us and required of a smurf
[2:02:54] saying
[2:02:55] sing us one of the songs
[2:02:58] a zion
[2:03:01] how shall we sing the lord's song
[2:03:06] in a strange land
[2:03:10] how can you sing the song thank god i'm
[2:03:12] free when you're still bound
[2:03:16] how can you sing the song jesus set me
[2:03:19] free
[2:03:20] when you're still enslaved by the
[2:03:23] taskmaster of sin
[2:03:27] when you see people today that's out
[2:03:29] there standing in the streets
[2:03:31] and they're crying for freedom they're
[2:03:33] crying for
[2:03:34] they're crying for moral freedom they're
[2:03:36] crying from freedom from
[2:03:37] police brutality they're crying from
[2:03:40] they're crying for their own freedoms
[2:03:42] and they don't even know what they want
[2:03:44] but they don't even realize that they
[2:03:47] are
[2:03:47] so enslaved by sin
[2:03:51] that he's got their reigns he's got the
[2:03:54] reigns on them and all he's got to do is
[2:03:57] talk them into one cigarette
[2:03:59] and they'll do the rest all he's got to
[2:04:01] do is talk him into mixing drinks one
[2:04:03] time
[2:04:04] and they'll do the rest all he's got to
[2:04:07] do is talk him into doubting the word
[2:04:09] one time
[2:04:10] and they'll do the rest so how can you
[2:04:12] sing
[2:04:13] the song of freedom when you're in a
[2:04:16] strange land
[2:04:17] you can't do it
[2:04:21] but you're not singing a song in a
[2:04:23] strange land
[2:04:25] you're singing a song of freedom in the
[2:04:27] land of the holy ghost
[2:04:32] oh hallelujah those that were standing
[2:04:35] side beside
[2:04:37] those servants and those that were born
[2:04:41] that were born israelite
[2:04:47] it didn't affect it didn't affect the
[2:04:50] servant
[2:04:52] when the jubilee trumpet sounded
[2:04:55] but when it sounded over the real true
[2:04:59] seed
[2:05:03] you see i watch it when i begin to watch
[2:05:07] as the priest begins to sound out that
[2:05:09] trumpet
[2:05:10] and i watch how's it how that that
[2:05:13] trumpet begins to sound
[2:05:15] and i watch as that warfare takes place
[2:05:18] i can watch when it affects a servant
[2:05:20] it'll roll right off of them but when
[2:05:23] you watch
[2:05:24] that sound of freedom hit a son
[2:05:28] they'll start running in their spirit
[2:05:31] they'll start shouting in their spirit
[2:05:33] they'll begin to pull on the word of god
[2:05:36] they'll begin to rejoice
[2:05:37] they'll throw down their hole they'll
[2:05:40] throw down and they'll start running
[2:05:41] back to everything
[2:05:43] that they had been robbed from they run
[2:05:46] back to that
[2:05:47] inheritance because there was a priest
[2:05:50] that grabbed a hold of the ram's horn
[2:05:54] hallelujah it was the sounding of the
[2:05:58] trumpet
[2:05:58] that made the real seed return
[2:06:12] we are not of the pond woman
[2:06:15] but of the free
[2:06:18] so paul told us to stand stand there for
[2:06:22] your liberty where christ has made you
[2:06:24] free
[2:06:24] and be not entangled again with the yoke
[2:06:26] of bondage and
[2:06:28] jesus said that when the truth when you
[2:06:31] hear the truth
[2:06:32] the truth shall make you free and
[2:06:35] whom the son has set free
[2:06:38] is free indeed
[2:06:58] it was the sound
[2:07:02] of a trumpet
[2:07:10] that screamed out a message of grace
[2:07:19] but if you refuse
[2:07:23] to hear
[2:07:26] that trumpet and go back to your
[2:07:29] rightful inheritance
[2:07:31] you're marked in the ear
[2:07:37] and you're never to be free again
[2:07:41] brother barum said as the musicians come
[2:07:47] that every age every generation
[2:07:51] has a fresh chance at the word
[2:07:57] you know god is obligated to give every
[2:07:59] person
[2:08:01] an opportunity to hear this word
[2:08:07] but for him to give you a second chance
[2:08:09] a third chance
[2:08:11] a fourth chance a fifth chance
[2:08:14] a sixth chance
[2:08:19] it's the sound of grace
[2:08:29] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:08:34] i say let freedom ring
[2:08:37] let's stand tonight
[2:08:48] oh father in heaven
[2:08:52] how gracious and pure are thy words
[2:09:01] full of grace and truth father
[2:09:05] that would set the captives free
[2:09:08] [Music]
[2:09:11] i remember
[2:09:15] when the grace of god was sounded forth
[2:09:19] my way
[2:09:28] oh hallelujah
[2:09:31] i look upon your children tonight and i
[2:09:33] see
[2:09:34] the grace of god that has called them
[2:09:39] out of the bondage of the slave master
[2:09:44] that they no longer have to stay there
[2:09:48] in that bound condition
[2:09:49] [Music]
[2:09:54] but it was the redeeming sound
[2:09:58] of the realm's horn that declared
[2:10:01] freedom over
[2:10:02] the real seed
[2:10:06] lord i pray one more time would you
[2:10:08] sound out
[2:10:10] that trumpet and may your seed come
[2:10:14] running
[2:10:17] no matter how many times they've been
[2:10:18] beat
[2:10:20] no matter how many times they've been
[2:10:22] told they can't go
[2:10:24] [Music]
[2:10:25] that they can go and they can walk out
[2:10:29] right now
[2:10:34] father it's your grace towards your
[2:10:36] children
[2:10:36] [Music]
[2:10:38] you've declared war
[2:10:40] [Music]
[2:10:51] and the enemy has tried to stop
[2:10:56] and tried to hinder and trying to affect
[2:10:59] and trying to cause interference
[2:11:02] but i believe there's an angel
[2:11:06] that's standing ever so close to wake
[2:11:08] him up
[2:11:11] i pray one more time father
[2:11:15] may they hear that trumpet sin
[2:11:21] may your grace be bestowed upon your
[2:11:23] children just now
[2:11:26] in jesus name amen
[2:11:30] amen do you love the lord tonight
[2:11:34] his grace
[2:11:42] [Music]
[2:12:12] [Applause]
[2:12:12] [Music]
[2:12:18] is
[2:12:22] [Music]
[2:12:30] i was
