[38:06] prayer and knows that knowing that God
[38:09] sees every every bit of that so we just

[38:32] God would uh bless his meeting there
[38:35] abundantly and also brother brother
[38:37] Ron's meeting there brother Wayne's
[38:38] there in Ohio he's ministering there
[38:41] with Brother David mayor this weekend so
[38:44] we just pray the Lord to give them both
[38:46] a good time and we grant them God's
[38:48] speed here tonight and so um uh just to
[38:52] just to make mention if if everybody
[38:55] everybody on on the way internet and
[38:56] also here just I know we got some that
[38:59] that come on Sundays that that are not
[39:01] able to come on Saturdays so they'll
[39:03] probably be listening to the service but
[39:05] there is a strong probability that we uh
[39:08] close service tomorrow um due to the ice
[39:11] and snow that possibly be coming and it
[39:14] could be hit or miss and uh but I will I
[39:17] will make a a call by about 8:30 or 9:00
[39:20] in the morning just to give ample time
[39:21] for for everybody that would be
[39:23] traveling and so so if anybody that's
[39:25] traveling about 4 hours away you want to
[39:28] you want to just use your own judgment
[39:30] there and uh I'm going to quote one of
[39:32] our Elder deacons
[39:34] here um that you know so this this could
[39:37] be real Hit or Miss I could hit it and
[39:39] we get ice and we you know it was the
[39:42] right thing to do or I could miss it
[39:44] completely and uh we don't get no I and
[39:47] we still don't have service so but I'm
[39:49] going to quote one of our Elder deacons
[39:51] here he said then he said it he said it
[39:53] kind of like this if if uh if one
[39:55] service makes you backslide you're in a
[39:57] pretty bad spot so so so we know we know
[40:02] I'm just ain't nobody wants to cancel
[40:04] service more and uh I I hate to cancel
[40:06] service but I I also want to use some
[40:08] real wisdom here in that and I don't
[40:10] want to take any chances getting anybody
[40:12] hurt so so you just be praying for us
[40:15] that we make the right decision and and
[40:18] uh so you just we're in that season of
[40:20] of snow right now so uh you know for the
[40:24] next couple months these possibilities
[40:25] could happen you well well it might not
[40:27] be snowing at your house well it might
[40:29] be snowing right here on this
[40:31] hill and this hill is it's a beautiful
[40:34] Hill to be on when the when the colors
[40:36] are changing and getting a pretty view
[40:39] but going off that thing in a sled is
[40:41] it's not something you want to do
[40:43] so oh uh we we just don't want to take
[40:46] any chances with that and so we believe
[40:48] in the power of prayer and we believe on
[40:50] laying hands on sick but I don't want to
[40:52] have to do it right after service after
[40:54] you get off this hill so so we just we
[40:57] just going to use some real wisdom
[40:58] tomorrow so uh you look for that text
[41:01] message or or or whatever and if you
[41:03] know somebody that doesn't get that
[41:05] church text if you wouldn't mind just
[41:06] reaching out to them we've tried to
[41:08] gather everybody that we can but
[41:10] sometimes people change their phone
[41:11] numbers and some things just slide
[41:13] through the cracks there so so uh you
[41:15] just you just bear with us tomorrow
[41:17] morning but either way tonight I got
[41:20] something real good for you and and I
[41:22] tell you what I believe it's I believe
[41:24] I've been blessed today studying it and
[41:26] this week we and so we just want to
[41:29] labor some things that are on our heart
[41:31] this this evening if you have your
[41:32] Bibles we'd like to look over into three
[41:35] portions of the scripture in 2 Samuel
[41:38] chapter 7 Luke chapter 1 and Matthew
[41:42] Chapter
[41:43] 2 I'd like to
[41:45] just fall right in line with our thought
[41:48] last weekend on the demand for a king
[41:51] and
[41:53] uh I know I lost my voice but I'm not
[41:56] going to repr preach that that sermon so

[42:10] here in this in this Christmas season we
[42:13] just want to be mindful of the lord we
[42:16] know that's where the people's minds are
[42:18] so just Gathering some inspiration here
[42:20] from the from the scriptures we just
[42:23] looking unto the Lord here
[42:25] tonight amen
[42:27] amen we just we love the Lord with all
[42:30] of our heart don't we with all our heart

[42:42] God sees each and every one of your
[42:43] hands let's just bind our faith together
[42:46] for all those that that couldn't be here

[42:50] here and uh just pray the Lord blesses
[42:53] them abundantly while we're here in the
[42:55] house of the Lord amen and Jesus said
[42:58] where two or three are gathered in my
[43:00] name there I am in the midst of them and
[43:03] I know that we've got some real
[43:04] situations here in our church and things
[43:07] that are spoken and things that are
[43:08] unspoken and I I believe that God is
[43:10] able to meet every one of these needs
[43:13] he's faithful so let's just go to him in
[43:15] prayer tonight Heavenly Father we
[43:17] approach you Lord Jesus Through Your
[43:19] Divine Mercy Lord we realize Lord
[43:22] because of the broken blood cell of
[43:24] Jesus Christ that we have access to come
[43:26] before you bold Lord Jesus to know you
[43:29] and to handle you it lord it's one of
[43:31] the greatest things of our life to be
[43:33] able to speak the name of Jesus Christ
[43:36] across our lips when people are born as
[43:39] a mute and never being able to speak
[43:41] that holy name and we get to pray it
[43:44] often as Christian Believers we get to
[43:46] speak your name and we realize that when
[43:48] we speak that name that Demons Run for
[43:51] Cover father I I've studied some things
[43:54] out about that name and how powerful
[43:56] that it is and how how Satanist and how
[43:59] even satanic Powers cannot even cannot
[44:02] even go around the name of Jesus Christ
[44:05] so father we realize Lord that the enemy
[44:08] would try to keep us from performing all
[44:10] of our actions and everything that we do
[44:12] and say in the name of Jesus so father
[44:15] we we come to you tonight and Lord
[44:17] there's uplifted hands there's unspoken
[44:19] and spoken request here and I pray
[44:22] father that you would move out across
[44:24] these needs just now and that you'd be
[44:25] ever so mindful of your people we are
[44:28] looking unto you the author and the
[44:30] finisher of our faith and we ask father
[44:32] Lord that you would Minister to us
[44:34] through the preaching of Thy word
[44:35] tonight minister to us and we'll be able
[44:38] to get oursel out of the way Lord and be
[44:40] able to say that it was good for us to
[44:42] walk with you and talk with you and our
[44:44] hearts burned oh god with the scriptures
[44:47] that were laid Upon Our Hearts but Lord
[44:50] don't let us fail to recognize you are
[44:52] in our midst so God we commit this
[44:55] service to you father and we ask God
[44:58] that you would just pour out your spirit
[45:00] and give us an an upper room experience
[45:03] as it were maybe it's not a maybe it's
[45:06] not 120 maybe it's not 250 maybe it's
[45:09] just one that needs a needs to know you
[45:11] as Savior and I pray father that you
[45:14] would come tonight and you'd be king in
[45:16] this place in the name of Jesus Christ
[45:19] amen and amen 2 Samuel 7 and verse 12
[45:26] and when thy day days be fulfilled Thou
[45:28] shalt sleep with thy fathers and I will
[45:31] set up thy seed after thee which shall
[45:34] proceed out of thy bows and I will
[45:38] establish his kingdom and he shall build
[45:41] an house for my name this isn't just
[45:44] talking about Solomon this is just
[45:46] talking about our Lord he shall he shall
[45:49] build an house for my name and I will
[45:52] establish the Throne of his kingdom
[45:55] forever I will be his father and he
[45:57] shall be my son if he commit iniquity I
[46:01] will chasen him with the rod of men and
[46:04] with the stripes of the Children of Men
[46:07] We realize by these scriptures that we
[46:09] are looking at our Lord Jesus Christ in
[46:11] prophetic form but Jesus is not going to
[46:14] commit iniquity he is going to carry
[46:16] your iniquities and by that he is going
[46:19] to take your stripes that you are
[46:21] willing that you were supposed to have
[46:23] but he is going to willingly take the
[46:25] iniquity of men upon him but my Mercy
[46:29] shall not depart away from him as I took
[46:33] it from Saul whom I put away before thee
[46:36] and thine house and thy kingdom shall be
[46:39] established forever before thee thy
[46:42] Throne shall be established forever Luke
[46:46] 1 and verse
[46:48] 30 and the angel said unto her fear not
[46:52] Mary for thou Hast found favor with God
[46:55] and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy
[46:57] womb and bring forth a son and shall
[46:59] call his name Jesus and he shall be
[47:02] great and shall be called the son of the
[47:04] highest and the Lord God shall give unto
[47:06] him the Throne of his father David and
[47:09] he shall reign over the house of Jacob
[47:12] forever and of his kingdom there shall
[47:15] be no end Matthew Chapter 2 and verse
[47:24] 1 now when Jesus was born born in
[47:27] Bethlehem of
[47:29] Judea in the days of Herod the king
[47:31] behold there came wise men from the East
[47:35] to Jerusalem saying where is he that is
[47:38] born King of the Jews for we have seen
[47:41] his star in the east and are come to
[47:44] worship Him may God bless his word you
[47:46] may be seated here tonight in the
[47:48] presence of the almighty God and His
[47:51] angels and his Saints and we'd like to
[47:54] speak to you a little thought here
[47:55] tonight on where is he King where is he
[47:59] King now brother Brandon would say this
[48:01] in events made clear by prophecy he said
[48:03] not one time has it ever missed and it
[48:06] won't for who are predestinated to see
[48:09] it will see it Jesus said no man can
[48:12] come to me except except my father draws
[48:16] him and all that the father has given me
[48:18] will come it's the word joining with the
[48:22] word it can't do nothing else so for
[48:25] whoever is destinated will see it it's
[48:28] the word joining with the word and we
[48:31] realize that when God has something that
[48:33] is that is laying there in his great
[48:36] architectural mind he has something that
[48:38] is laying there that he's going to
[48:39] fulfill in a certain season or in a
[48:42] certain time that God is going to have
[48:44] he's going to have somebody a believer
[48:47] that is going to call for it or a
[48:49] believer that is in position to point
[48:51] out that this is the event of that time
[48:53] or the event of his coming because God
[48:56] is the god of supply and he understands
[48:59] the concept of supply and demand just
[49:02] like it was in the days of in the days
[49:04] of Egypt when Egypt was going getting
[49:06] ready to go through a famine he had a
[49:08] son of prosperity that was in position
[49:11] to take care of a limping Prince or a
[49:13] prince that was with power you see when
[49:15] Joseph or when Joseph was in position he
[49:19] wasn't just preserving Egypt but he was
[49:21] going to be taken care of Israel at the
[49:24] same time because God is the god that
[49:27] supplies all of our needs when you look
[49:30] at it at the the Widow of zerath when
[49:32] she was there when she was in her time
[49:34] of need and she'd got down to her very
[49:36] last meal you see there was a demand in
[49:39] her life for provision and the god of
[49:43] the god of the Bible had sent a
[49:45] prophetic messenger down there that had
[49:47] been supplied by Angelic Porters been
[49:50] feeding there by the book of terth but
[49:52] yet he was a God that was going to
[49:54] supply something more than just a
[49:57] prophetic realm but he was going to feed
[49:59] somebody that was in need or was
[50:02] demanding something so God had a
[50:04] prophetic Ministry that would go by her
[50:06] way and would literally give her
[50:08] spiritual food in new season because God
[50:12] is the god of Supply just like it was in
[50:15] the days of Jesus when the 5,000 that
[50:17] had been following him for the right
[50:19] reasons when they got into this position
[50:22] they were following him because of his
[50:24] teachings but they were lacking
[50:25] sustenance in their life and the demand
[50:28] was great for this crowd that was
[50:30] following Jesus so Jesus literally
[50:32] became the supply for the demand in that
[50:35] situation because Jesus understood what
[50:38] it takes that there was a demand so he
[50:41] became the supply and took two two
[50:44] fishes and five loaves of bread and met
[50:47] the demand of that hour and you can look
[50:49] at it and all throughout all the
[50:51] scriptures you can find that Jesus is
[50:53] the kind of God that will supply any
[50:55] demand that is is there and the
[50:57] scriptures are saying there in
[50:59] Deuteronomy 17:14 and 15 that God is
[51:02] going to supply a the demand for a king
[51:06] that is coming into when these people
[51:08] come into their position they're going
[51:10] to demand him of a king so God is going
[51:13] to he's going to he's going to supply
[51:15] them with the kind of King that he he
[51:18] has had in his mind and in his heart
[51:21] because God is the god of
[51:24] Supply somebody say that with me tonight
[51:27] that God is the god of Supply you know
[51:30] you know the the letter of to the
[51:32] Philippians said in in chapter 4 and 19
[51:36] that my God shall supply all your needs
[51:39] according to his poor Glory no it's
[51:43] absolutely not poor Glory but it's
[51:45] according to his riches and glory in by
[51:48] Christ Jesus he is a God that will
[51:50] supply all of your needs I don't know
[51:53] what you are in need of here tonight or
[51:56] in need of in your life but I believe
[51:58] that God can supply whatever you have
[52:00] need of you see and Israel was in a spot
[52:04] where they were demanding a king and you
[52:06] just just give me a brief minute here
[52:08] just to lay out some some history here
[52:12] just to to to illustrate some things but
[52:15] you see Israel had got thems themselves
[52:17] in a position where they're wanting to
[52:19] be like the rest of the world but God
[52:21] was going to supply them with Kings but
[52:24] these Kings were not going to meet their
[52:25] demand you see you see there there under
[52:28] the United monarchy when when when the
[52:31] Kings begin to rise in power we realize
[52:34] that the first king of Israel was was
[52:36] Saul and he led campaigns and he he
[52:39] would go against the Philistines and he
[52:40] would he would unite the tribes of
[52:42] Israel together but ultimately he
[52:45] disobeyed God and he lost God's favor
[52:48] you then you see David coming to view he
[52:51] was a known he was known as a man after
[52:53] God's Own Heart he defeated Goliath he
[52:56] United Israel and he made Jerusalem the
[52:59] capital and he and he he authored many
[53:02] Psalms that you and I realize were
[53:04] prophetic forms of Jesus Christ and even
[53:07] is even prophetic for this day that you
[53:09] and I are living in and David didn't go
[53:12] nowhere without the Ark of the Covenant
[53:15] and he was he was responsible for
[53:17] bringing the Ark of the Covenant back to
[53:19] Jerusalem Solomon if you look at his
[53:22] accomplishments in his kingship he was
[53:25] he was known for his renowned wisdom
[53:28] that was given to him by almighty God he
[53:31] was he was used by God to build the
[53:34] first temple that God had in his mind
[53:37] and there he be to expand Israel's
[53:39] wealth and their influence but if you
[53:42] study out Solomon's life Solomon as a
[53:45] king begin to fall into idol worship
[53:48] later on in his life and then you come
[53:51] into a period of the divided monarchy
[53:54] when you see Kings rising up in theing
[53:56] Kings of uh of kings of Judah which is
[53:58] in the southern Kingdom the king of that
[54:01] is known as a the the his name is rabam
[54:05] and his accomplishments as a king are
[54:08] his harsh his
[54:10] harshness that he that he he he had such
[54:13] harsh tactics that he literally cused
[54:17] the kingdoms
[54:19] Divine that's a that's a that's a pretty
[54:22] tough deal that he had such harsh ways
[54:25] that he be to divide these kingdoms that
[54:28] had been United together that's the kind
[54:30] of King you don't want right there that
[54:33] brings division instead of of of unity
[54:36] but in it all Judah remained they
[54:39] remained loyal to David and his and his
[54:41] lineage then you see Jehoshaphat raise
[54:44] up and you you see him and in his
[54:47] accomplishments as a as a king he he
[54:50] literally he strengthened Judah
[54:52] spiritually and he begin to go in there
[54:55] and he begin to remove Idols he was
[54:57] known as a man that sought God but he
[55:00] was also known as a man that had
[55:02] questionable alliances in his kingship
[55:05] he would identify himself with different
[55:07] Kings and he would he would be a man
[55:09] that God would that brother Ram would
[55:11] say he was a he was a he was a God man
[55:13] but he he also if you study out he was
[55:15] he was standing with some uh pretty
[55:17] questionable characters as well and then
[55:20] you see under that under the king of
[55:22] Judah you seeing you see Hezekiah that
[55:25] rises up and when you when you see these
[55:27] Kings rise up you begin to see hope that
[55:30] is lifted back into Israel you begin to
[55:32] see men like Hezekiah was a king that
[55:35] trusted God he he he completely he
[55:37] completely put his full intent on
[55:40] serving God he he he he loved the Lord
[55:42] he actually came in there and he
[55:44] reformed the worship back to the true
[55:47] and living God and he resisted an
[55:49] Assyrian Invasion and he is known for
[55:52] his powerful prayers and the faith that
[55:55] he had in almighty God and you remember
[55:57] when you go to studying out the book of
[55:59] kings that you'll find that there
[56:00] Hezekiah in 2 Kings 14 you'll find that
[56:04] Hezekiah that the that the king that the
[56:07] king of Assyria sent a cherb that he he
[56:09] literally he starts mocking he starts
[56:12] mocking the kingship and he starts
[56:14] telling people that they can't trust in
[56:16] the leadership over there in Israel and
[56:18] and he brings up all kinds of Lies
[56:20] against him and he and he starts
[56:21] bringing in all these kinds of threats
[56:23] and he and he starts literally mocking
[56:25] the the the the the leadership there in
[56:28] Israel and and he and here's S A cherup
[56:31] he comes in and I I'm just going to say
[56:33] it because I I don't know I don't I I'll
[56:35] say it but I don't think I'm saying it
[56:37] right but sin chera brings in his
[56:40] messenger ra rakah and he brings in and
[56:44] he brings in these letters he brings in
[56:46] a letter and he begins to insult God he
[56:49] begins to insult Israel he begins to
[56:51] insent he begins to insult Hezekiah and
[56:54] he brings all these things in there but
[56:56] instead of Hezekiah succumbing to the
[56:59] fear of it of the tactics of the enemy
[57:02] Hezekiah takes these letters that have
[57:04] come in against him and they they come
[57:06] in there and they've got all these
[57:08] basically witchcraft ideas that they are
[57:11] bringing against the church and Hezekiah
[57:14] lays them he goes into the house of the
[57:16] Lord and he lays out the mocking and the
[57:21] threatenings he lays out the mocking and
[57:24] the threatenings of of Israel's of
[57:26] Israel's of uh mockers that are there
[57:29] and he literally goes in there and he
[57:31] prays such a powerful prayer that the
[57:34] people on the outside of the Tabernacle
[57:38] feel the influence of hezekiah's prayer
[57:41] and hezekiah's prayer brought one
[57:45] Angel he brought one Angel and destroyed
[57:49] 185,000 Assyrians because Hezekiah knew
[57:53] how to
[57:54] pray I believe that we are living in an
[57:57] hour where we see a fall and demise of
[58:01] people but we also see a rise in people
[58:05] that know how to pray that believe in
[58:08] God no matter what they come up against
[58:10] men like Hezekiah women like Deborah
[58:14] that that knew how to praise God in the
[58:16] midst of people that would not worship
[58:19] God that would not pray to God there was
[58:23] somebody in the midst of the cursing of
[58:25] the enemy God raised up some prayer
[58:34] warriors
[58:36] Hezekiah you study out his life Hezekiah
[58:40] had spent time with
[58:42] God he literally gets a death warrant on
[58:45] his life from the prophetic Ministry and
[58:48] he turns towards the wall and said God
[58:50] I'm not done with my time
[58:52] yet he said I'm not done with my time
[58:55] here yet so I'm asking you for some more
[58:57] years on my life and that might be you
[59:00] you may not have had that time to
[59:02] advance and destroy your enemy like the
[59:04] way that you think that you should so
[59:07] literally what I'm telling you to do as
[59:09] a king of the Lord is to turn your face
[59:12] towards the wall and begin to pray and
[59:15] weep to God and let God roll back the
[59:18] time in your life I believe there's such
[59:21] power in your prayer brother Tommy
[59:23] Richmond sent me a sent me a clip this
[59:25] week of of how powerful that prayer is
[59:29] studying out this thought he sent me
[59:31] this and I thought it was quite profound
[59:33] he sent me of of three uh ex satanists
[59:36] that had became Christian how that they
[59:39] would how that they would work in their
[59:41] Realms of uh of Satanism that they would
[59:44] work in there and they would literally
[59:46] they would they would I don't know any
[59:48] other way to say it but basically
[59:50] teleports from here to there and
[59:52] basically they would try to curse this
[59:54] neighborhood or curse C that
[59:56] neighborhood and this Satanist said he
[59:58] he said I was he said I was literally he
[1:00:01] said I was I I left this place and I
[1:00:03] went over here and I was trying to curse
[1:00:05] this neighborhood he said but he said
[1:00:07] whatever I did I could not curse that
[1:00:09] neighborhood he said and the reason I
[1:00:11] found out that I couldn't curse it was
[1:00:13] because it was a Christian neighborhood
[1:00:16] and those Christians were praying the
[1:00:18] prayer of faith over top of that
[1:00:20] neighborhood that God would keep that
[1:00:22] neighborhood and God would bless that
[1:00:24] neighborhood so that Satanist was not
[1:00:27] able to place a curse there I tell you
[1:00:30] how powerful that it is that Satan
[1:00:32] cannot curse what God has already
[1:00:39] blessed one of one of those Satanist
[1:00:42] that had that had turned to a Christian
[1:00:45] he said one time he said we were having
[1:00:47] a a a Satanism rally he said we were
[1:00:49] having this rally he said we would
[1:00:51] gather together and he said we we were
[1:00:53] sitting there and he said we was trying
[1:00:55] to curse these people he said and all of
[1:00:57] a sudden he said an orange he said an
[1:00:59] orange Cloud came and hung over there in
[1:01:01] the corner he said and he said we
[1:01:03] gathered back together he said and all
[1:01:05] of a sudden that orange Cloud be to rage
[1:01:08] he said rage and he said out of it spoke
[1:01:11] a voice and said whatever you do never
[1:01:14] send me to a Christian
[1:01:19] again never send me to a Christian again
[1:01:23] now one thing to recognize is how
[1:01:25] manipul live that the Satan is I thought
[1:01:28] it pretty powerful that a Satanist said
[1:01:30] that an orange Cloud appeared and how
[1:01:32] close that Satan likes to get to the
[1:01:34] real thing of a amber colored light
[1:01:37] coming into a room setting over top of a
[1:01:40] prophet setting over top of a people but
[1:01:42] that powerful how powerful that it is
[1:01:45] that Satan would come back those demons
[1:01:47] from that world that would Transformer
[1:01:50] them things transform themselves as
[1:01:52] angels of light would say don't you ever
[1:01:54] send me to a Christian's home again I
[1:01:57] said let's keep up our prayer
[1:01:59] life that the devil says don't you send
[1:02:02] me back down there no more don't send me
[1:02:05] back down I'll say you got that kind of
[1:02:08] a power as a king to pray that kind of a
[1:02:11] prayer that Satan doesn't know what to
[1:02:13] do with
[1:02:16] you I believe I'm talking to them kind
[1:02:19] of people I'll tell you what kind of
[1:02:21] people that you are it doesn't matter
[1:02:23] how old you are because God raised up a
[1:02:26] king by the name of Josiah that was 8
[1:02:28] years old and started reigning in Judah
[1:02:32] and he started reforming the worship and
[1:02:35] when he turned 20 years old he
[1:02:37] completely cast down every Idol that was
[1:02:40] in
[1:02:42] Judah when his daddy wouldn't do it God
[1:02:45] raised up a
[1:02:47] Josiah that would cast down idol worship
[1:02:51] so what am I saying I'm saying there's
[1:02:52] some 8-year-old boys and some 8-year-old
[1:02:55] girls
[1:02:56] maybe their mom ain't living the message
[1:02:58] and maybe their daddy ain't living the
[1:03:00] message but God raise up some so
[1:03:04] Josiah God rais us up some Josiah
[1:03:07] that'll return us back to true
[1:03:16] worship then zedekiah comes
[1:03:20] in he's the last
[1:03:23] king before the Babylonian EX
[1:03:28] he's got a personal
[1:03:30] friendship and his counselor is
[1:03:33] Jeremiah but even in that he still did
[1:03:36] evil in sight of the
[1:03:38] Lord and He begin to lead Jerusalem to
[1:03:41] their utter fall so you can have William
[1:03:44] brandham as a
[1:03:45] friend you can have him as your
[1:03:47] counselor you can listen to 1,00 sermons
[1:03:50] and you can still do evil in sight in
[1:03:52] the sight of the Lord so it doesn't
[1:03:54] matter what you been listening to what
[1:03:57] matters is who's on your
[1:03:59] heart come on somebody I will say this
[1:04:01] that there are people that listen to the
[1:04:04] message and read their Bible and pray
[1:04:06] and still go to a devil's
[1:04:09] hell I know that might sound extreme but
[1:04:12] that's how extreme that is between a
[1:04:14] born- again believer and a nonborn again
[1:04:16] believer there's a lot of people that
[1:04:18] read the Bible that are not bride
[1:04:20] material there's a lot of people that
[1:04:22] wear wear the standard of Holiness but
[1:04:25] are not red material there's a lot of
[1:04:27] people that look like a king but are
[1:04:29] never
[1:04:33] crowned come on somebody look at
[1:04:37] absolum look at David's son when Solomon
[1:04:40] was a rightful one to step into Power he
[1:04:43] starts walking into the fellowship of
[1:04:45] being a king but a prophet comes and
[1:04:49] ordains that Solomon is to be king so
[1:04:52] just because you declare you're King
[1:04:55] does not make you a
[1:04:59] king I got
[1:05:05] heavy smile at your neighbor said hands
[1:05:08] brother Andrew loves
[1:05:10] me and then
[1:05:12] you and then you step into the Kings of
[1:05:16] Israel in the northern kingdom and you
[1:05:18] see jeroboam rise up and his
[1:05:20] accomplishments are he's the first King
[1:05:22] of the
[1:05:24] North and he's introducing idol worship
[1:05:27] back into bethl and Dan again then you
[1:05:29] see Ahab rise up and he he begins to
[1:05:31] promote baale worship through his wife
[1:05:33] Jezebel and his ministry is to confront
[1:05:37] Elijah through a woman then you see ju
[1:05:41] who rise up because he's anointed to be
[1:05:43] king he's anointed by Prophet Eli by the
[1:05:46] prophet Elisha he goes in there and
[1:05:48] under his anointing he kill he kills
[1:05:51] Jezreel the evil king of jehoram he goes
[1:05:54] in there and by his Ministry he casts
[1:05:57] down Jezebel and he begins to eradicate
[1:05:59] all of bell worship throughout all the
[1:06:01] land but even in J's Zeal for the true
[1:06:06] and worship God J still tolerated cath
[1:06:10] worship and idol worship down there in
[1:06:12] bethan
[1:06:13] Dan then you see ho HOSA rise up he's
[1:06:17] the last king of
[1:06:19] Israel and his Rebellion against Assyria
[1:06:21] led to the fall of Israel and the Exile
[1:06:24] of the 10 tribes and then you come on
[1:06:26] the on the post Exile side of things and
[1:06:29] you see Kings like zerubba will rise up
[1:06:31] he's under the descendants of David who
[1:06:34] led who led the rebuilding of the temple
[1:06:37] under the Persian rule so basically when
[1:06:39] you when you see zerubabel you can
[1:06:41] picture him with a blueprint of the of
[1:06:44] the temple back in his hand and he's
[1:06:46] standing there back in his rightful spot
[1:06:49] and he's going to establish it back
[1:06:51] again but then there comes another king
[1:06:54] and this is where things get begin to
[1:06:56] get interesting is because because this
[1:06:59] King by the by the name of Herod the
[1:07:01] Great he begins to represent an
[1:07:03] architectural Legacy and he starts
[1:07:07] standing before a grand Temple and he
[1:07:09] starts rebuilding and adding on his own
[1:07:11] thoughts to what needs to be added he is
[1:07:14] the king that is in position when the
[1:07:17] true king
[1:07:19] comes you say what all that what is all
[1:07:21] that about brother Andrew I I said all
[1:07:24] that to say this
[1:07:26] is that Earthly Kings can never meet the
[1:07:31] demand they can never meet the demand so
[1:07:34] so your your your emotions can never
[1:07:38] meet the
[1:07:40] demand for the supply that you need your
[1:07:43] conscience cannot meet the demand your
[1:07:46] affections cannot meet the demand are
[1:07:50] you with me I'm going through your five
[1:07:52] five rounds of your spirit they can
[1:07:54] never meet the demand but there's
[1:07:56] something deeper there's something
[1:07:58] greater than your just Earthly spirit
[1:08:01] and your Earthly body because we contact
[1:08:05] This World by these five senses here but
[1:08:08] there is something greater that you do
[1:08:10] not see that is
[1:08:13] residing even when your affections are
[1:08:16] against you even when your emotions are
[1:08:18] against you even when your conscience is
[1:08:21] against
[1:08:22] you there is something that the king
[1:08:27] deposited you see when when when Herod
[1:08:30] didn't see it and when zerubba didn't
[1:08:33] see it let me go back to a little bit
[1:08:35] further when Ahab didn't see it there
[1:08:38] was coming a king that was going to
[1:08:41] remain
[1:08:45] King because Saul was going to live and
[1:08:47] he was going to die David was going to
[1:08:49] live and he was going to die Solomon was
[1:08:52] going to live and he was going to die
[1:08:54] Ahab was going to live and Ahab was
[1:08:56] going to die you see there was a demand
[1:08:59] for eternal life from a king so God
[1:09:02] raised up his only
[1:09:04] son because God was tired of Earthly
[1:09:08] Kings failing him so he had a demand so
[1:09:12] he he supplied his own
[1:09:19] son hallelujah
[1:09:22] hallelujah hallelujah I tell when you
[1:09:25] run ragged when you're at the end of
[1:09:27] your rope I'll say that God's got the
[1:09:30] pillar of fire that is right there to
[1:09:32] guide you when you are when you're at
[1:09:34] the end of your at the end of your wits
[1:09:37] he's the kind of God that will supply
[1:09:40] all of your needs I say it in Earthly
[1:09:43] Realms in financial Realms in spiritual
[1:09:47] Realms I say there is a demand for a
[1:09:51] body to be
[1:09:53] changed and God has got to
[1:09:58] supply I I tell you there ain't nobody
[1:10:00] like my king because my king he rules
[1:10:03] with Justice he leads with Mercy his
[1:10:07] actions declare his humility his kingdom
[1:10:10] is eternal and unshakable he is not just
[1:10:14] the king of one land the king of the
[1:10:16] Jews but he is the king of the Gentiles
[1:10:19] he is the king of all Nations because he
[1:10:22] had three wise men that came from all
[1:10:24] the way of the the other side of India
[1:10:27] that was led by the supernatural so we
[1:10:29] could say it like this he's the king of
[1:10:31] Africa he's the king of Ireland he's the
[1:10:34] king of England he's the king of Canada
[1:10:37] he's the king of America he's the king
[1:10:39] of all lands for all people and that
[1:10:42] same God that anointed a star to show up
[1:10:46] at the right time has anointed the
[1:10:48] seventh star to show up in this time to
[1:10:51] direct the supernatural people by their
[1:10:54] ordination by their election and the
[1:10:57] reason why you're following this seven
[1:10:59] star it shows that God put something on
[1:11:02] the inside of you that the world will
[1:11:05] never get out of
[1:11:09] you
[1:11:12] Hallelujah begin to study this
[1:11:15] event begin to look at this
[1:11:19] event of this light
[1:11:22] coming no man could come to the father
[1:11:25] except he draws him now no man can
[1:11:29] understand how great he is unless he
[1:11:31] allows him to know him so God has
[1:11:34] allowed a supernatural element to be
[1:11:37] released in this hour brother Shannon so
[1:11:39] that you could understand you're a part
[1:11:41] of the headship so that you could begin
[1:11:43] to recognize that there's something
[1:11:45] greater than yourself here so he allowed
[1:11:47] a Ministry to come by your way to turn
[1:11:49] your attention and the reason why your
[1:11:52] attention has been turned is because
[1:11:54] there is a prophetic ministry under the
[1:11:56] ministry of Malachi 4 that has literally
[1:11:59] turned your hearts you see you see those
[1:12:02] men had been studying out the scriptures
[1:12:04] brother M would say it like this he said
[1:12:06] they was over there studying out the
[1:12:07] Book of Daniel he said they was over
[1:12:09] there reading he said and they was
[1:12:10] reading about the the how that how that
[1:12:13] Daniel said that there would be a rock
[1:12:15] that would be cut out of a stone in a
[1:12:16] Wilderness he said as he said that he
[1:12:19] said all of a sudden they saw a stranger
[1:12:21] in the sky and they saw that stranger up
[1:12:24] there now I maybe I'll just paint it for
[1:12:26] you just like this you see they saw
[1:12:28] William brandom as a stranger amongst
[1:12:30] the ministry but you and I recognize
[1:12:33] that it was more than just a man this is
[1:12:35] more than just a hillbilly Kian that
[1:12:38] turned our hearts back to what Paul
[1:12:40] preached but there was literally a
[1:12:42] supernatural light that would literally
[1:12:44] turn
[1:12:46] us this star passed every church this
[1:12:50] star passed every Observatory but they
[1:12:52] didn't see it but there was some
[1:12:55] Hallelujah there was some Believers that
[1:12:58] had been studying out the scripture and
[1:13:00] when they saw the star the Bible said
[1:13:03] they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy
[1:13:08] they'd been waiting for it they had
[1:13:10] looked at all their papers they had
[1:13:12] looked at all their blueprints they had
[1:13:13] study out the sky and they didn't have
[1:13:16] anything there that could point to them
[1:13:19] that this was something but something
[1:13:21] had come
[1:13:22] together because of false prophet
[1:13:25] I testified in numbers 24 that a star
[1:13:29] would
[1:13:30] rise and these
[1:13:33] men I wouldn't say lucky these men were
[1:13:36] blessed these men were
[1:13:38] predestinated you weren't lucky to come
[1:13:40] to this message you weren't lucky just
[1:13:43] to be born in the right family you were
[1:13:51] predestinated
[1:13:53] Hallelujah back to you the headship is
[1:13:57] here to lead you the headship is not
[1:14:00] going to take you it's not going to take
[1:14:01] you somewhere he's not going to allow
[1:14:03] his body to go somewhere that he's not
[1:14:06] willing for it to go but the headship is
[1:14:08] leading you because the headship is
[1:14:10] Christ and brother random would say in
[1:14:12] the five identifications of Jesus Christ
[1:14:14] he said who set this up he said who set
[1:14:17] up this mystical body he said none other
[1:14:19] than Jesus Christ he said but when did
[1:14:21] he set it up he set it up on the day of
[1:14:24] Pentecost you see this kingship that you
[1:14:26] under it's unlike any other king because
[1:14:30] Kings of this world are governed they're
[1:14:33] governed and they have
[1:14:35] intermediaries that literally tell them
[1:14:37] their Bishops say they begin to tell the
[1:14:39] king about this and they begin to tell
[1:14:40] the king about that and say well this
[1:14:42] should be done we should apply this tax
[1:14:44] we should apply this kind of blessing
[1:14:46] but this kingship that you are under
[1:14:48] ain't nobody telling King Jesus what to
[1:14:51] do when he decides to bless you they
[1:14:54] know nobody going to talk him out of it
[1:14:56] there ain't two other people up there
[1:14:58] trying to talk him out of your elect but
[1:15:00] he Hallelujah he's the kind of King that
[1:15:03] he wills and he reigns in his own
[1:15:07] heart let me put it in a different in a
[1:15:09] different aspect like this so that maybe
[1:15:11] you'll catch the attention of it it's
[1:15:13] like a great Orchestra and that
[1:15:15] Orchestra they are well trained and they
[1:15:18] are only paying attention to one person
[1:15:20] they ain't paying attention to the
[1:15:21] player beside them they ain't paying
[1:15:23] attention to the critics out there
[1:15:25] they're sitting out there getting ready
[1:15:26] to write a magazine they are not paying
[1:15:28] attention to the people that think
[1:15:30] they're better than you them people are
[1:15:33] only paying attention to one person and
[1:15:35] they're paying attention to that
[1:15:36] conductor it doesn't matter what the
[1:15:38] conductor does it doesn't matter how the
[1:15:41] conductor feels it doesn't matter what
[1:15:43] the conductor sees the conductor's
[1:15:46] already got it in position the condition
[1:15:49] is he's already thought of you before
[1:15:51] the foundation of the world and the
[1:15:53] Sheep music is in place so all you have
[1:15:55] to do is literally Hallelujah get under
[1:15:58] the harmony of the
[1:16:03] kingship so no preacher can talk you in
[1:16:05] it and no preacher can talk you out of
[1:16:08] it come on somebody and no critic can
[1:16:11] talk you in it and no critic can talk
[1:16:13] you out of
[1:16:14] it no sign can take it away from you no
[1:16:17] wonder can give it to you he is the king
[1:16:22] over every situation
[1:16:28] H
[1:16:31] Glory now David said it like
[1:16:34] this in Psalms 42
[1:16:37] and7 deep calls to deep at the noise of
[1:16:41] thy water spouts I love how brother
[1:16:44] Brandon would say it like this he said
[1:16:45] now he said before there could be a fin
[1:16:49] on the fish's back it had to be some
[1:16:51] water for him to swim
[1:16:53] in you see you may not realize it but
[1:16:56] any any of these mothers that went
[1:16:58] through
[1:16:59] motherhood you may not even had a a a a
[1:17:03] positive pregnancy test but you begin to
[1:17:06] recognize something was different about
[1:17:08] you you begin to you begin to eat things
[1:17:12] you wouldn't typically eat peanut butter
[1:17:14] on a
[1:17:16] pickle you start you start acting
[1:17:19] different you start carrying yourself
[1:17:20] different you ain't got nothing new yet
[1:17:21] you don't even you don't even know
[1:17:22] nothing's changed but something is
[1:17:24] changing
[1:17:26] what is it there's something there's
[1:17:27] something on the inside of you that's
[1:17:29] that's literally changing you like it's
[1:17:31] like that boy brother brand talk about
[1:17:33] is funny it's like that boy brother man
[1:17:36] will talk about that boy that he was
[1:17:38] lacking he was lacking that uh sulfur in
[1:17:40] his body so he started eating that
[1:17:41] rubber eating rubber off him uh bicycles
[1:17:44] and so you see there was something
[1:17:46] lacking there and you see you see it was
[1:17:48] something that was working on him that
[1:17:50] he couldn't physically see and these
[1:17:53] wise men they couldn't even realize that
[1:17:56] before that star got into existence
[1:17:59] there was something in them that would
[1:18:02] give them the ability to be able to see
[1:18:05] and Jesus said except you be born again
[1:18:09] you cannot understand you cannot see the
[1:18:11] kingdom of God and the reason why your
[1:18:14] natural birth cannot comprehend this
[1:18:17] message is because this is not
[1:18:19] comprehended by a natural natural state
[1:18:26] but you have to be born again this is
[1:18:29] more than a
[1:18:30] Reformation this is more than just a
[1:18:32] halfway house here this is more than you
[1:18:35] just coming here and get rid of your
[1:18:37] getting rid of your habits and getting
[1:18:38] rid of your trials and getting rid of
[1:18:40] your addictions this is about getting
[1:18:43] transformed let me tell you something I
[1:18:46] if if we do nothing else here but get
[1:18:48] you born
[1:18:49] again I have done my
[1:18:52] job I don't care if I ever
[1:18:55] ever get the chance to ever see you
[1:18:57] speak in tongues brother brother
[1:18:58] Jonathan but if I can lead you to a born
[1:19:01] again experience I have done my job in
[1:19:04] the ministry if I can set up your
[1:19:07] heart for the King of
[1:19:10] Kings come on somebody we're not
[1:19:13] teaching you how to deal with your drug
[1:19:15] habits we're not teaching you how to
[1:19:17] deal with your pornography habits we're
[1:19:19] not teaching you how to get over this
[1:19:21] and get over that we are teaching you by
[1:19:24] by Bible Doctrine how to be Bible Sons
[1:19:27] and Daughters of
[1:19:29] God I'm not teaching your children how
[1:19:32] to deal with complexes and how to deal
[1:19:34] with stigmas I'm teaching them how to
[1:19:38] eradicate what good is sticking a devil
[1:19:41] over in the corner and going and being
[1:19:43] tempted by him every single day I say
[1:19:46] kill that devil eradicate that devil get
[1:19:50] rid of it
[1:19:53] [Applause]
[1:19:56] come on somebody God did not raise us up
[1:20:00] just to be streamers of the message God
[1:20:03] raised us up to be Christians that
[1:20:06] forsake not their assembling of
[1:20:09] themselves together and when you do that
[1:20:12] you are expressing the very thought of
[1:20:16] the
[1:20:17] king you see when a king is in his
[1:20:20] domain he can have full
[1:20:22] expression so let me say it to you like
[1:20:25] this the reason why the reason why the
[1:20:29] reason why he can express himself in
[1:20:32] Mark 16 that they shall lay hands on the
[1:20:34] sick and they shall recover is because
[1:20:36] there is somebody that is on the throne
[1:20:37] room of your
[1:20:39] heart come on some you would not believe
[1:20:41] that unless the King was there you would
[1:20:44] not believe you would not believe in a
[1:20:47] born- again experience unless a king
[1:20:49] said it but where the word of a king is
[1:20:52] there is power there is anointing there
[1:20:55] is an
[1:20:58] influence
[1:21:01] Glory I'm worked
[1:21:04] up I'm worked up
[1:21:07] man I am worked up cuz ain't nobody
[1:21:10] going to deny this
[1:21:12] King there was a lot of people that did
[1:21:15] not identify themselves with Ahab there
[1:21:17] was a lot of people that did not
[1:21:19] identify themselves with Trump and did
[1:21:21] not identify themselves with Biden bring
[1:21:23] it down to your level just for a minute
[1:21:25] but I Hallelujah no matter what no
[1:21:28] matter whether I'm a Believer I make
[1:21:30] believer or an unbeliever I cannot deny
[1:21:33] that Jesus is King because before this
[1:21:36] world is over every knee is going to Bow
[1:21:39] every tongue is going to
[1:21:43] [Applause]
[1:21:45] confess yet a little while and the world
[1:21:48] won't see me but you'll see me because I
[1:21:51] live you live the reason why you believe
[1:21:55] is because
[1:21:56] God deposited his kingship his domain
[1:22:01] his
[1:22:03] rule I'm worked
[1:22:05] up I'm worked up so let me ask you where
[1:22:09] is
[1:22:10] he where is he King of the
[1:22:12] Jews if I could be his voice just for a
[1:22:15] minute I'm right here I'm right here I'm
[1:22:19] in my word I'm in my bride I'm in my
[1:22:22] people where is he you're looking at
[1:22:28] him that's why William brandham could
[1:22:30] preach God's only provided place of
[1:22:33] worship I'm
[1:22:37] here you're not worshiping William
[1:22:39] brandham you're not worshiping Ron
[1:22:41] Spencer you're not worshiping Tim puit
[1:22:44] you are seeing the god of the Bible rule
[1:22:47] himself through his
[1:22:50] people somebody give God praise
[1:22:54] [Applause]
[1:22:56] Hallelujah where's he at he's here he's
[1:23:01] the same yesterday today and
[1:23:05] forever he eradicates fear he destroys
[1:23:10] Devils he torments the Tormentor he
[1:23:14] accuses the
[1:23:16] accuser Hallelujah
[1:23:26] I hope we have church
[1:23:29] tomorrow brother bam said it brother
[1:23:32] brand said in the great Shining Light
[1:23:35] here was Gentiles in the city of
[1:23:37] Jews crying where is he born King of the
[1:23:40] Jews now to me I could stop right there
[1:23:43] and eat on that one
[1:23:46] sentence here's
[1:23:48] Gentiles in the city of Jews crying
[1:23:51] where's he where's he King of the Jews
[1:23:55] in a city that should have recognized
[1:23:58] him amongst the church world that should
[1:24:00] have seen
[1:24:01] him amongst the denominations that
[1:24:04] should have been looking for
[1:24:09] him we've seen a star in the east and
[1:24:11] we've come to worship Him He said what a
[1:24:14] striking event of this day oh merciful
[1:24:16] father as we look and thank the Jews so
[1:24:18] asleep so asleep under Magi until Magi
[1:24:22] Eastern Gentiles had come from Far lands
[1:24:25] traveling to find the king of the Jews
[1:24:28] and they know nothing of
[1:24:30] it you look at
[1:24:33] it you look at it in this
[1:24:36] age three kings were in
[1:24:40] rign king of rock and roll Martin Luther
[1:24:44] King and King
[1:24:46] Jesus and they missed they missed the
[1:24:50] most important
[1:24:52] one their eyes were on the king of Music
[1:24:55] their eyes were on the king of of
[1:24:57] society and
[1:24:58] socialism but they miss the king of the
[1:25:05] world and that's why William brandham
[1:25:07] indicted this
[1:25:09] generation he said what a striking event
[1:25:12] I love that he said now he said today
[1:25:15] has God God has taken uneducated men
[1:25:20] that be me boys and girls who probably
[1:25:23] have no more than and a grammar school
[1:25:25] education he raised him up by the power
[1:25:27] of the Holy Ghost is crying in the ears
[1:25:29] of the church he's here in his great
[1:25:32] power to infold himself and to make
[1:25:34] known and the churches know nothing
[1:25:36] about it I love this he said they come
[1:25:38] to give homage they come to give honor
[1:25:40] to the King of Kings but they were not
[1:25:43] Kings but they were great enough to be
[1:25:45] honored guests of the
[1:25:48] king Hallelujah here they are sitting on
[1:25:52] the back of these stately animals as
[1:25:54] they go through the streets saying where
[1:25:55] is he at born King of the Jews the Bible
[1:25:58] said that all Jerusalem and Herod was
[1:26:01] troubled their testimony stirred
[1:26:05] something and we have church tomorrow
[1:26:08] I'm going to stir up
[1:26:10] something he said isn't it too bad today
[1:26:12] that the church can't arise out of its
[1:26:14] stupidity of theological exercises to
[1:26:17] see the power of the Living God
[1:26:18] resurrected Christ in his glory as an
[1:26:21] illiterate uneducated IND denominational
[1:26:23] movement striking at the world these
[1:26:26] wise men had a question and their
[1:26:29] question demanded an answer he was a
[1:26:32] kind of God that was going to meet the
[1:26:35] supply you see you look at the contrast
[1:26:38] har was worked up the the religious
[1:26:41] world was worked up but these Kings had
[1:26:45] a Hungry Heart to find them one was
[1:26:49] wanting to kill him one was wanting to
[1:26:52] worship Him you find the same thing
[1:26:54] today they're wanting to kill the move
[1:26:56] of the Holy Ghost but then there's some
[1:26:58] that are wanting to water it with a
[1:27:00] fresh Pentecostal drink because he's
[1:27:02] King you look at the contrast of it
[1:27:06] he he will
[1:27:13] supply
[1:27:16] Hallelujah I ain't went 30 minutes yet
[1:27:18] God bless
[1:27:19] you my brother maram said in question

[1:27:55] hands are present okay praise
[1:28:00] God now brother Rand said in question
[1:28:02] answerers he said now watch now notice
[1:28:04] these wise men that's funny these wise
[1:28:06] men follow the star I'm going to take it
[1:28:09] back more of a minor way see the Wise
[1:28:12] Men followed his star asking where is he
[1:28:14] born King of the Jews he said you've
[1:28:15] heard that song we've seen his star in
[1:28:17] the east and have come to worship Him He
[1:28:19] said you heard that read it in the
[1:28:20] scripture he said all right Westward
[1:28:22] leading still proceeding God to thaty
[1:28:24] Perfect Light he said see the star was
[1:28:26] guiding to the perfect light because the
[1:28:27] star was only reflecting in light he
[1:28:30] said that's where we got this out here
[1:28:33] the other day see how many was here
[1:28:35] Sunday brother bam is referring back
[1:28:38] when he's he's ministering in in in uh
[1:28:41] on January the 8th of uh he's he's
[1:28:43] ministering on Revelations chapter 4 you
[1:28:45] can go back and listen to that series
[1:28:47] it's very powerful but brother R he goes
[1:28:49] in here he said now he said how many was
[1:28:50] here how many was here Sunday to see
[1:28:52] that he said see just got through
[1:28:55] preaching about it Shak Glory reflected
[1:28:57] in the star and the star reflects it he
[1:29:00] said here was the angel of the Lord
[1:29:01] standing here on the platform reflecting
[1:29:04] it back out there out of the shik glory
[1:29:07] it's just exactly the same he said there
[1:29:09] it was exactly looking here at the real
[1:29:12] one looking out there and it being
[1:29:14] reflected light on the side like that
[1:29:18] now notice that that star that the wise
[1:29:21] men were following where did he get his
[1:29:23] light from
[1:29:24] brother Bandon would tell us that that
[1:29:26] that star is only reflecting its light
[1:29:29] but you notice what the ability of that
[1:29:32] star was was to lead the ones that were
[1:29:35] following it to the word you see there's
[1:29:37] a lot of people that follow signs but
[1:29:40] those signs don't F lead you to the word
[1:29:43] you see you've got to watch you've got
[1:29:45] to watch false lights and true lights
[1:29:48] but how you find them out is how it
[1:29:50] leads you to the word now brother
[1:29:52] Brandon is drawing that out of
[1:29:53] Revelation Gans 4 and 5 and out of the
[1:29:55] throne proceeding Lightnings and
[1:29:57] thunderings and voices and there were
[1:29:59] seven lamps of fire burning Before the
[1:30:01] Throne which are the seven spirits of
[1:30:02] God he said God speaking to the church
[1:30:05] in the in the sermon he said God
[1:30:07] speaking to the church reflecting
[1:30:09] himself through the seven spirits when
[1:30:12] the true anointed of God speaks it's the
[1:30:14] voice of God he said to reject it is to
[1:30:16] move the Candlestick or to remove the
[1:30:19] Candlestick he said voices he said the
[1:30:21] voice of the seven Church ages over here
[1:30:23] in the corner the voice is speaking with
[1:30:26] thundering and lightning so to reject
[1:30:29] that voice is to move the candle stick
[1:30:32] or to remove the church age but to
[1:30:35] reflect it is to put it in its position
[1:30:39] he said if you have not received the
[1:30:40] light I'm trying to point you to one
[1:30:42] here not the one here at the pull
[1:30:45] pit because each and every one of us are
[1:30:48] a light is that right you are a city on
[1:30:52] a hill a candle on a hill set before a
[1:30:55] set before a city you see if you haven't
[1:30:57] received the light I'm trying to point
[1:30:58] you to one not one here at this Pulpit
[1:31:01] the one there at that throne and that
[1:31:04] Throne must be coming your heart then
[1:31:06] you'll see exactly the same thing that
[1:31:09] it's reflected here he said what is it
[1:31:11] up here it's reflecting this and this is
[1:31:14] the word you see you are representing a
[1:31:19] power you see when last weekend how many
[1:31:23] was here last weekend on Sunday you
[1:31:26] begin to watch a very Supernatural and
[1:31:28] special event you begin to watch brother
[1:31:31] Ron as you begin to operate operate
[1:31:33] under what was he he was not oper
[1:31:36] operating under his flesh he was
[1:31:38] operating under the headship and he
[1:31:40] begin to reflect he begin to reflect
[1:31:43] something only almighty God could
[1:31:46] do now that wasn't just for just for
[1:31:49] these two girls here but there were
[1:31:51] people on the other side of the United
[1:31:54] States that had been dealing with skin
[1:31:56] conditions when brother Ron rolled up
[1:31:58] his sleeves they were immediately got a
[1:32:01] touch from the
[1:32:05] Lord go ahead that's TR I go ahead and
[1:32:07] praise
[1:32:08] [Applause]
[1:32:11] him but where did brother Ron get that
[1:32:14] idea from he was representing a power
[1:32:18] you see Satan doesn't have to mind me
[1:32:20] but he has to mind the power that I
[1:32:22] represent
[1:32:24] so that's why it matters who you're
[1:32:28] reflecting you see this light that they
[1:32:31] were following had a power behind it it
[1:32:33] was leading them to the word and this
[1:32:36] message that you are following that is
[1:32:38] leading you will take you right to the
[1:32:44] word the reason why so many people don't
[1:32:47] believe in miracles is because there's
[1:32:49] not a there's not a king of the throne
[1:32:51] the reason why people believe that the
[1:32:52] supernatural isn't present is because
[1:32:54] he's not on the throne the reason why
[1:32:56] people don't believe in an outpouring of
[1:32:58] the Holy Ghost no more is because he's
[1:33:00] not on the throne but when a king is in
[1:33:02] his
[1:33:03] domain when a king is in his domain he
[1:33:06] said have faith in God that whosoever I
[1:33:10] love that he didn't say if a bishop says
[1:33:12] it he didn't say if a prophet says it he
[1:33:14] didn't say if a preacher says it but
[1:33:16] whosoever shall speak to this mountain
[1:33:18] be thou
[1:33:20] removed when you are expressing mark 22
[1:33:25] through 24 you are expressing there is a
[1:33:31] king H what was it's so common to
[1:33:36] us it's so common to us I was listening
[1:33:38] to it the other day M brother Matthew I
[1:33:42] I I thought it so
[1:33:45] powerful brand was preaching on I have
[1:33:47] heard but now I see and he starts
[1:33:50] talking about Mark 11:22 24 brother say
[1:33:53] he starts talking about
[1:33:55] it it starts taking us through something
[1:33:58] that we hear over and over and over
[1:33:59] again he talks about what the third pool
[1:34:02] is and what the third pool
[1:34:05] does and a lot of people think well
[1:34:07] brother Ron's just simply telling those
[1:34:09] stories about that woman getting out of
[1:34:11] that wheelchair over again brother Ron's
[1:34:13] just simply telling that story about
[1:34:15] about laying hands laying hands on that
[1:34:17] woman over in Germany that was death
[1:34:19] that was death and she couldn't hear she
[1:34:21] could only hear by hearing eights and
[1:34:23] she come and handed it back to him I
[1:34:25] said well brother Ron's just telling
[1:34:26] stories because that happened in brother
[1:34:27] Ron's Ministry people hear brother
[1:34:30] brandham and and he that is in you start
[1:34:32] telling stories about a 42-inch caribou
[1:34:34] and start talking about Silver Tip gz
[1:34:36] Grizzly BL and they think brother
[1:34:37] brandom's just filling up time and
[1:34:40] there's a lot of people that sit right
[1:34:41] here in Services think well brother
[1:34:43] Ron's just just talking about his own
[1:34:44] self he's bringing up his own Ministry
[1:34:46] he's bringing up thing he's really
[1:34:48] trying to point things to himself you
[1:34:50] got to be an idiot
[1:34:54] forgive me that was associate pastor and
[1:34:57] Son all at the same
[1:35:01] time you think about
[1:35:04] it I must have got a hold of brother
[1:35:06] Matthew's notes
[1:35:14] again and you hear brother man starts
[1:35:17] talking about and he that is in you the
[1:35:19] big
[1:35:20] mats my mat
[1:35:24] I ain't read brother Matt Eminem's words
[1:35:26] just yet
[1:35:28] so brother Mar starts talking about then
[1:35:31] three squirrels and people like I done
[1:35:34] heard that a 100
[1:35:35] times I'll tell you something it meant
[1:35:38] something real special to Sister
[1:35:43] Hattie it meant something real special
[1:35:45] to Sister Hattie it was more than a
[1:35:47] story to Sister Hade when she was
[1:35:49] sitting there and all of a sudden the
[1:35:50] king comes in the room and she says that
[1:35:52] ain't nothing but the truth she said
[1:35:54] ain't nothing but the truth it meant
[1:35:56] something more than just a story to
[1:35:57] Sister Hattie she could say I heard
[1:36:00] about it but now I see it Lily you heard
[1:36:04] about it but you getting ready to see it
[1:36:07] you heard about it you heard about it
[1:36:09] you heard about it it's more than a
[1:36:12] story I identify this to you that this

[1:36:18] already doneall
[1:36:24] what is William BR doing he is
[1:36:26] expressing the kingship of Mark
[1:36:29] 11 that wasn't William Bram he said them
[1:36:33] things were sovereignly
[1:36:37] given so when the supernatural Falls in
[1:36:40] here is it brother Andrew or is it
[1:36:42] brother Ron or is it the
[1:36:45] king I identify that he is king of kings
[1:36:50] and he is Lord over this church

[1:37:10] days 36 hours brother Steven laying
[1:37:13] there brain dead I identify that that

[1:37:19] room because my daddy was a dead man
[1:37:21] according to doctor standards
[1:37:24] but it was more than a story to me when
[1:37:26] a man that was operating under the
[1:37:28] kingship of Mark 11 whosoever shall
[1:37:31] speak to this
[1:37:32] mountain and he prayed the prayer over
[1:37:35] him I identify that that was more than a

[1:37:43] action Hallelujah I heard about it I
[1:37:47] heard about it I heard about a God that
