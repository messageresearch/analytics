[45:28] this scripture pertains to you there's
[45:31] some that pertain to other people but
[45:33] this one pertains to you so I want you
[45:36] to help me read it today okay and so as
[45:41] I read you read okay behold I show you a
[45:45] mystery we shall not all sleep but we
[45:48] shall all be changed in a moment and in
[45:52] the twinkling of an eye at the last
[45:54] Trump for the trumpet shall sound and
[45:58] the dead shall be raised Incorruptible
[46:01] and we shall be changed for this
[46:04] corruptible must put on incorruption and
[46:08] this Mortal must put on
[46:11] immortality and when this corruptible
[46:13] shall have put on
[46:15] incorruption this Mortal shall have put
[46:18] on immortality and then shall be brought
[46:21] to pass the saying that is written death
[46:25] is swallowed up in Victory
[46:27] oh death where is thy sting oh grave
[46:31] where is thy Victory The Sting of death
[46:34] is sin and the strength of sin is the
[46:37] law but thanks be to God which giveth us
[46:41] the victory through our Lord Jesus
[46:44] Christ let's read this last verse
[46:46] together with power therefore my beloved
[46:50] Brethren be you steadfast unmovable
[46:54] always abounding in the work of the Lord
[46:57] for as much as you know that your labor
[47:00] is not in vain in the Lord amen God
[47:04] bless you you can be
[47:12] seated we're very much aware that we're
[47:15] influenced from another
[47:19] world that's quite a statement isn't
[47:23] it and we realize that this message is
[47:26] advancing us progressively toward a body
[47:30] change and we're moving into another
[47:33] realm the world doesn't realize that but
[47:37] I'd like to just capture a couple of in
[47:40] last ages of things that happen if we
[47:43] could imagine John Wesley 5 foot one
[47:46] redheaded I'm always having affinity for
[47:50] him and he's speaking with such power
[47:53] and
[47:54] anointing and it becomes so
[47:57] powerful he's not in a church but he's
[47:59] in a open
[48:01] field 10,000 people are slain in the
[48:07] spirit in an open
[48:11] field he didn't quite understand what it
[48:14] was all about but he knew that there was
[48:16] an influence from another realm that was
[48:19] happening as a matter of fact John
[48:22] Wesley was preaching and with such power
[48:25] the people were just so slain and he
[48:28] himself was going out trying to get them
[48:30] to set up and
[48:32] listen he would try to raise them up
[48:34] what I've got to say is important but it
[48:37] was so
[48:42] powerful another place he's
[48:45] preaching and a huge crowd of people is
[48:48] there and a hail storm comes and he
[48:51] tells them leave you got to go home this
[48:54] storm is too bad and they just kept
[48:56] screaming we refuse to go home we love
[49:00] what is being
[49:01] said hallu it must shake the
[49:06] devil Charles feny who was a lawyer and
[49:11] became a preacher he got the Holy Ghost
[49:14] and he was ashamed at first but he got
[49:16] the Holy Ghost and and then God would so
[49:19] anoint him Rochester New York would
[49:22] become the place to where that he would
[49:24] preach there and would preach with such
[49:29] anointing until men would drop their
[49:32] lunch
[49:33] pales five miles
[49:36] away and give their hearts to Jesus
[49:41] Christ there was such an anointing under
[49:43] his preaching until the police didn't
[49:46] have a job to do and so they became the
[49:50] original barbershop
[49:54] quartets Jail's emptied
[50:02] Hallelujah the influence is just not in
[50:05] the pull pit but it has incredible
[50:08] results the scripture says in Hebrews
[50:10] chap 11:8 by faith Abraham when he was
[50:15] called to go out into a place which
[50:18] which he should after receive for an
[50:20] inheritance obeyed and he went out not
[50:25] knowing whether he went
[50:27] by faith he sojourned in a Land Of
[50:29] Promise as in a strange country dwelling
[50:33] in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob The
[50:36] Heirs with him of the same promise for
[50:41] he looked for a city notice these words
[50:44] for he looked for a city which had
[50:47] foundations whose Builder and maker is
[50:54] God you're looking for a city aren't
[50:59] you through faith also Sarah received
[51:04] strength to conceive seed and was
[51:07] delivered of a child when she was past
[51:09] age because she judged him faithful who
[51:13] had
[51:14] promised therefore spring even one of
[51:17] one and and in an him as good as dead so
[51:23] many as the stars of the sky in the
[51:26] multitude
[51:27] as the sand which were by the seashore
[51:32] innumerable quite a statement you're in
[51:35] that
[51:38] scripture these all died in faith having
[51:41] received the promises but having them
[51:45] AAR off and were persuaded of them and
[51:49] embraced them and confess that they were
[51:51] strangers and pilgrims on the Earth and
[51:56] they that say such things declare
[51:58] plainly that they seek a country and
[52:02] truly if they have been mindful of that
[52:04] country from when they came out that
[52:07] they might had opportunity to have
[52:09] returned but notice these next words but
[52:12] now they desire a better
[52:15] country that is a Heavenly whereof God
[52:19] is not ashamed to be called their God
[52:23] for he hath prepared for them a city
[52:27] and by faith when he was tried offered
[52:29] up Isaac and he that had received the
[52:33] promise offered up his only begotten son
[52:36] of whom it is said that in Isaac shall
[52:39] thy seed be called AC accounting that
[52:42] God was able to raise him up even from
[52:47] the dead when went also he received him
[52:52] a in a
[52:54] figure I'd like to just just kind of lay
[52:57] out some ground thoughts this morning we
[53:00] are citizens of another
[53:05] world this is only a temporary
[53:09] place we stepped out of Eternity into
[53:13] time and we'll Fellowship here in this
[53:16] natural realm and there's a lot of
[53:18] things that you will go through but we
[53:21] will never be comfortable in this world
[53:26] let's just go ahead and get that settled
[53:29] we will never be comfortable in this
[53:31] world we are being pulled by the message
[53:35] of the hour into another
[53:39] dimension Jesus would declare I go to
[53:42] prepare for
[53:45] you a
[53:48] place that where I am there you may be
[53:55] also amen aren't you glad of that now
[53:58] now listen Abraham was looking for a
[54:02] city whose Builder and maker was God and
[54:06] there's a reason why that he was looking
[54:08] for a city he met the king of that
[54:12] City that King came to his home and sat
[54:17] with him he called him God he called him
[54:22] Lord he had been talking to him from
[54:25] another dimension
[54:26] he heard his
[54:28] voice many conversations that God had
[54:32] with with Abraham and we could go
[54:34] through it and spend days on it I I am
[54:37] your buckler I am your Shield I am your
[54:40] reward and he constantly told him that
[54:43] he had a covenant with
[54:46] Abraham and Abraham would go home and no
[54:50] doubt tell his family about he had been
[54:52] fellowshipping with a with a voice
[54:56] he had been in the spirit and it was
[54:58] beyond anything that he could comprehend
[55:01] but God was establishing a covenant with
[55:05] him amen not a thousand people with him
[55:11] and with his seed that he did not have
[55:14] and when God came and visited with him
[55:18] he came and he didn't have a father or a
[55:21] mother and he was not from a local city
[55:24] or a local town but but the voice that
[55:27] was in that body he had been listening
[55:30] to that's right so all the questions
[55:34] were taken care of and he be to make him
[55:38] a
[55:39] promise that there was going to come
[55:42] seed through Sarah and then he asked
[55:45] where Sarah was at knowing where she was
[55:50] at and he asked Sarah a question and I
[55:53] want to ask you this question is the
[55:56] there
[56:00] anything is there anything
[56:05] impossible with
[56:09] god brother Ron but we've had the
[56:11] message all of these years that's true
[56:15] but we have been fellowshipping with the
[56:17] voice that brought the
[56:20] message we have met the
[56:22] king you have felt him sweep through
[56:25] this audience and audiences all around
[56:28] the
[56:29] world our Prophet had to leave us and
[56:33] every message was orchestrated it was
[56:36] Way Beyond the voice of a
[56:39] man we understand that but that presence
[56:43] that is Among Us that's
[56:45] him that's the mighty angel from another
[56:48] world that's the world that we're
[56:50] fellowshipping
[56:53] with and we leave the W merch and we
[56:56] leave leave our jobs when we come to
[56:59] church and then we begin to be pulled
[57:02] into another realm one day we'll never
[57:04] leave that other
[57:07] [Applause]
[57:14] realm the scripture Bears out that Jesus
[57:17] walked in Two Worlds at the same time
[57:20] brother Brandon would explain to us and
[57:23] he would say it in many different I
[57:25] don't have time this morning but he
[57:26] would say it and I just want to give you
[57:28] a couple examples brother brandom said
[57:30] you know I'm standing in Two
[57:35] Worlds at the same
[57:40] time I'm searching for her spirit just

[57:49] service and he turns to Billy and says
[57:52] go pray for it no Daddy no Daddy brother
[57:55] R steps out but behind the pull pit he
[57:57] said just a moment I'm searching for her
[58:02] spirit she had passed from this
[58:05] Dimension and was going to another
[58:10] dimension and he began to look for her
[58:16] transport and he found her and then he
[58:19] called her by name didn't know
[58:21] her excuse me he didn't know her and he
[58:25] said Mary
[58:27] and she set right up yes brother
[58:33] Brandon yes brother brandom let me just
[58:36] say don't be scared of death it's an
[58:43] Uber now listen the world can be scared

[1:02:28] calling you brother Ron he said what it
[1:02:30] would

[1:02:33] said I thought this would bring great
[1:02:35] courage to you and he said I had not I
[1:02:39] had not shared it with another soul and
[1:02:43] I was holding this and I was dealing
[1:02:45] with it and he said I got two more

[1:07:57] major disciples
[1:08:00] Apostles whatever you want to link them
[1:08:03] to
[1:08:05] writers of your New
[1:08:08] Testament and the message declares
[1:08:10] something that's so
[1:08:14] real I want to make sure that you get
[1:08:16] this so I'm going to take a
[1:08:18] moment they were men on the Earth but
[1:08:21] they were anointed From Another

[1:08:28] chapter
[1:08:29] 4 there's a there's a lion
[1:08:34] anointing there's an ox anointing all
[1:08:37] the way to the eagle
[1:08:40] anointing and each of these
[1:08:43] writers catch the spirit or the
[1:08:46] anointing from that serpant
[1:08:49] realm and the sarapin will be declared
[1:08:53] in
[1:08:54] Isaiah as the
[1:08:56] Protectors of the holies of
[1:09:00] holies they're they're beasts don't

[1:09:26] Matthew begins to
[1:09:28] write and brother brandom comes to
[1:09:31] Matthew and he comes to 20 chapter 28
[1:09:33] and verse 19 go ye therefore and teach
[1:09:37] All Nations baptizing them in in the
[1:09:39] name of the father and the son and of
[1:09:43] the Holy Ghost and brother brand even
[1:09:46] declares he said I wonder why he wrote
[1:09:47] it like that but he was protecting the
[1:09:51] book of Acts
[1:09:56] he was protecting the book of
[1:09:59] Acts and then Mark begins to write of
[1:10:03] the power to the
[1:10:05] believer and it was protecting the power
[1:10:09] you'll cast out
[1:10:11] Devils you'll take up serpents and it
[1:10:14] won harm them he was protecting the book
[1:10:18] of
[1:10:20] Acts John was protecting the deity of
[1:10:24] who Jesus Christ
[1:10:30] was let me just say this to you John was
[1:10:34] standing there and he didn't start when
[1:10:37] Mary conceived he goes all the way back
[1:10:40] in the
[1:10:41] beginning yes sir in the book John
[1:10:45] chapter 1 he goes back in the
[1:10:48] beginning to declare to you that Jesus
[1:10:51] is more than a man he's more than a
[1:10:54] prophet but he's God on the earth he's a
[1:11:03] messiah but he also describes it in such
[1:11:06] a way until he blinds every
[1:11:16] trinitarian I'm talking to you about
[1:11:18] influence from another
[1:11:20] world watch these writers as they start
[1:11:23] out
[1:11:25] when Peter would
[1:11:27] stand you men of
[1:11:31] Judea you crucified the
[1:11:33] Messiah and they begin to say this same
[1:11:41] Jesus it's too
[1:11:43] good I'm
[1:11:49] sorry I'm time conscious but I want to
[1:11:51] get this to you you men of Israel hear
[1:11:55] these
[1:11:57] words listen just only a few days ago he
[1:12:01] had been a
[1:12:03] coward but the influence of another
[1:12:07] world was now just not on him but it was
[1:12:11] in
[1:12:16] him listen when you receive the Holy
[1:12:19] Ghost it's not just on
[1:12:23] you it's just not on you catch this it's
[1:12:27] just not around
[1:12:33] you but Zoe God's own
[1:12:38] life is poured on the inside of
[1:12:45] you goes to the king chamber of your
[1:12:48] heart where once set another king and
[1:12:52] you lusted and you was prideful
[1:12:56] and you did bad things but the new
[1:13:00] [Applause]
[1:13:10] king you men of Israel hear these words
[1:13:14] Jesus of Nazareth a man approved among
[1:13:17] you by Miracles and wonders and signs
[1:13:20] which God did by him in the midst of you
[1:13:22] as you of yourselves also know him being
[1:13:25] and delivered of determinant counsel
[1:13:27] knowledge for knowledge of God ye have
[1:13:30] taken and by Wicked hands have crucified
[1:13:33] and slain whom God has raised up having
[1:13:36] loose the Pains of death because it is
[1:13:39] not possible that he should be Holden of
[1:13:41] it for David speaking concerning him I
[1:13:45] forsaw the lord always before my face
[1:13:47] for he is on my right hand that I should
[1:13:50] not be
[1:13:53] moved therefore did my heart heart
[1:13:55] rejoice and my tongue was glad moreover
[1:13:57] My Flesh was shall Rest In
[1:14:01] Hope because thou wal not leave my soul
[1:14:04] in Hell neither will I suffer thy Holy
[1:14:06] One to see corruption thou has made
[1:14:08] known to me the ways of
[1:14:11] life Thou shalt make me full of joy with
[1:14:15] thy
[1:14:16] countenance many Brethren let me freely
[1:14:19] speak to
[1:14:20] you of the patriarch David that is both
[1:14:24] dead and buried and as a Seer is with us
[1:14:27] until this day therefore being of a
[1:14:31] prophet knowing that God hath sworn with
[1:14:33] an oath to him that of the fruit of his
[1:14:36] loins according to his flesh he would
[1:14:38] raise up Christ to sit on his
[1:14:42] throne and he seeing before he spake of
[1:14:45] the resurrection of Christ that his soul
[1:14:48] was not left in Hell neither his flesh
[1:14:51] did see
[1:14:52] corruption now notice what he does
[1:14:55] this
[1:14:59] Jesus this
[1:15:02] Jesus has God raised up whereof we are
[1:15:05] all
[1:15:08] Witnesses therefore being by the right
[1:15:10] of the hand of God exalted and having
[1:15:13] received the Father the promise of the
[1:15:15] Holy Ghost he has shed forth this which
[1:15:18] ye now see and hear for David is not
[1:15:21] ascended into the heavens but he saith
[1:15:24] unto to himself the Lord said unto my
[1:15:27] Lord sit on my right hand until I make
[1:15:30] thy foes thy foot
[1:15:33] stol therefore let all the house of
[1:15:36] Israel know ass surely that God hath
[1:15:39] made that same
[1:15:42] Jesus whom ye have cr crucified both
[1:15:46] Lord and
[1:15:50] Christ now when they heard this they
[1:15:53] were pricked in their heart
[1:15:55] and said unto Peter and to the rest of
[1:15:57] the Apostles men and Brethren what shall
[1:16:00] we do and Peter said unto
[1:16:04] them
[1:16:07] repent because you got to be born
[1:16:11] again and be baptized every one of you
[1:16:15] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:16:19] remission of sins you revoke the
[1:16:23] jurisdiction of that that other
[1:16:27] king and he no longer has control over
[1:16:31] you no
[1:16:41] more and you shall receive the gift of
[1:16:44] the Holy
[1:16:45] Ghost for This Promise is unto you and
[1:16:49] to your children and to all that are far
[1:16:51] off even as many as the Lord Our God
[1:16:54] shall call
[1:16:58] all now now watch this but brother Ron
[1:17:02] Jesus said he
[1:17:06] did Matthew
[1:17:08] 28:19 but if you remember the influence
[1:17:10] of another world was
[1:17:16] blocking was
[1:17:18] blocking non seed from Catching it
[1:17:27] the influence from another world for
[1:17:30] 2,000 years has block
[1:17:35] nonseed from Catching
[1:17:37] it where does that put me brother Ron it
[1:17:41] puts you to the spot to that serpant
[1:17:44] that's standing there guarding that
[1:17:47] scripture there's no way you can miss it
[1:17:59] for four
[1:18:01] chapters he blocks non
[1:18:06] seed but for four chapters he opens the
[1:18:10] book and said your name is written in
[1:18:14] the book
[1:18:25] and when you read it with the Revelation
[1:18:27] in your eyes you
[1:18:28] go well how in the world could anybody
[1:18:31] miss
[1:18:36] it how can anybody miss it you don't
[1:18:40] understand there's two
[1:18:42] worlds there's two worlds at work even
[1:18:46] right
[1:18:48] now are you with me the serin is making
[1:18:52] sure Hallelujah the serpant is making
[1:18:56] sure from that realm that the seed of
[1:19:06] God is catching
[1:19:09] it now remember now I want to go back
[1:19:12] and catch a couple of
[1:19:13] things
[1:19:15] remember God knows who you are
[1:19:18] that's now I want you to catch
[1:19:21] this God knows who you are
[1:19:25] but Abraham didn't know who he
[1:19:28] was so God had to make
[1:19:31] sure that he could see what God saw in
[1:19:38] him cuz there's a lot of times in your
[1:19:41] life you don't know who you
[1:19:47] are you did your best but one day he be
[1:19:52] to Quicken things into your life
[1:19:57] and he does it individually he don't
[1:19:59] necessarily do it whole
[1:20:02] family all of a sudden you're catching
[1:20:05] it and then you find out your wife's
[1:20:08] catching it and then later on your
[1:20:10] children begin to catch it because he's
[1:20:13] a personal
[1:20:14] [Applause]
[1:20:22] God now now watch it watch a couple
[1:20:25] things I want I want to catch some
[1:20:27] things
[1:20:31] now now we're built a a Triune
[1:20:34] being and we're we've got a flesh realm
[1:20:37] and we got a spirit realm and we got a
[1:20:38] soul realm and there's inlets to your
[1:20:42] soul and inlets to your
[1:20:45] soul it's kind of like a 10-point
[1:20:49] deer and there's five antlers on one
[1:20:52] side and five on another side
[1:20:55] and see taste smell and then there's
[1:20:59] emotions and there's reasons and
[1:21:01] conscience and all of these and memories
[1:21:04] they're on the other side and there's
[1:21:06] gateways that come to your
[1:21:08] soul now now Satan is
[1:21:12] allowed to
[1:21:14] introduce from His World
[1:21:20] music and he introduces from his his

[1:21:43] information there's news and there's
[1:21:45] gossip and and there's just
[1:21:49] posting all over the place and because
[1:21:52] of this is the day of people's right
[1:21:55] everybody thinks that I got a
[1:21:58] right to post my opinion to the whole
[1:22:05] world and so we you know we hear people
[1:22:10] they get up in the morning Andrew was
[1:22:12] touching it last night and he didn't

[1:22:44] group and another Rich trillionaire will
[1:22:47] begin to spend money and and you'll see
[1:22:49] all these activists out doing their
[1:22:51] thing and all their signs and all these
[1:22:53] different kind of things don't even go
[1:22:55] to that
[1:22:58] school who
[1:23:01] cares what you don't see is Israel's
[1:23:04] doing what they're supposed to be
[1:23:06] doing Russia's doing what they're
[1:23:08] supposed to be
[1:23:09] doing but the bride is doing what
[1:23:12] they're supposed to
[1:23:21] do so you got to guard your soul
[1:23:27] well brother on I just got to know all
[1:23:29] those things
[1:23:30] really why don't you turn that energies
[1:23:33] into reading
[1:23:37] scriptures read the church age book and
[1:23:40] read the shal
[1:23:42] because there's nothing that let me just
[1:23:45] say this there's nothing on ABC and NBC
[1:23:47] and CBS and Fox News there's no
[1:23:51] rapturing power in none of that
[1:24:01] well I I watch the weather all the time
[1:24:04] well if you pay attention there's people
[1:24:07] that live in Tornado Alley that are out
[1:24:09] in their yards video in the storm
[1:24:15] coming who's going to have the most
[1:24:17] dangerous
[1:24:19] video instead of getting in a
[1:24:22] cover instead of getting in a in a
[1:24:25] shelter somewhere or another they're out
[1:24:28] videoing something that's going to crush
[1:24:30] their
[1:24:35] home listen we've been warned about this
[1:24:39] world by a prophet of God there's a
[1:24:42] storm
[1:24:44] coming get in the arms of Jesus Christ
[1:25:04] I I want to share something here getting
[1:25:07] quiet with
[1:25:08] Jesus is an important thing in our lives
[1:25:12] amen now you know we have saw Jesus we
[1:25:16] saw the
[1:25:17] prophet and they displayed some things
[1:25:19] and but there was something that that I
[1:25:21] think is
[1:25:23] incredible it's not necessarily thing
[1:25:25] the things that they said was so
[1:25:28] powerful it was a things that was left
[1:25:34] unsaid Jesus could have stood there and
[1:25:37] told the mysteries of the
[1:25:39] Kingdom but he held
[1:25:43] it show us a miracle but he held
[1:25:47] it are you with
[1:25:51] me sure brother brandom in that
[1:25:54] Dimension read people's heart read
[1:25:56] people's lives that was not a man did
[1:25:59] that that was God did that no man can do
[1:26:02] that no man can do
[1:26:05] that and listen even a minister that has
[1:26:08] the Insight of of of different things to
[1:26:12] be able to read people's
[1:26:13] lives if he has any ability at
[1:26:18] all the things that he says are not near
[1:26:21] as po powerful as the things that he
[1:26:24] don't
[1:26:28] say and he holds that to himself and he
[1:26:32] holds that because sometimes things that
[1:26:35] could be said would destroy
[1:26:41] lives brother Ron I need a quote brother
[1:26:43] B said if I'd see you going down the
[1:26:46] road and getting a car wreck I wouldn't
[1:26:48] tell you because every time you got in
[1:26:51] the car you would think about that
[1:26:56] are you with me are you with me brother
[1:26:58] brand would say some things and I I want
[1:27:00] to just catch you just for a moment he
[1:27:02] said my Ministry is praying for the sick
[1:27:05] and in order to do that I must come into
[1:27:08] another world that people don't know
[1:27:11] nothing
[1:27:13] about quite a
[1:27:16] statement my work another place my work
[1:27:20] is in a realm of spirits that's where I
[1:27:23] live a big part of my life is in another
[1:27:25] dimension that the world knows nothing
[1:27:29] about I speak in the name of the Lord
[1:27:32] and they don't understand there's no
[1:27:35] need of trying to explain
[1:27:38] it no way to explain
[1:27:42] it well what brother Ron what does those
[1:27:44] quotes have to do with
[1:27:46] us let me just say this to you you work
[1:27:50] with people every day on your job that
[1:27:53] have no idea
[1:27:57] idea they have no idea of the realm that
[1:28:01] you're living
[1:28:03] in they have no
[1:28:07] idea don't try to explain it to
[1:28:11] them they're interested in the race this
[1:28:14] weekend or in the baseball this weekend
[1:28:17] or or in whatever is going on this
[1:28:19] weekend what happened in politics you
[1:28:22] have no interest in it right
[1:28:26] the greatest part of your week you come
[1:28:28] into a service and you get lifted into a
[1:28:30] Heavenly
[1:28:33] realm how many's ever heard of 100
[1:28:37] Proof Sinners sorry
[1:28:43] Sinners are you with me I want to just
[1:28:46] remind you that brother brandom was
[1:28:48] carrying
[1:28:52] water he was carrying in water to his
[1:28:55] father's
[1:28:57] steel that would intoxification
[1:29:27] let me just let me just build on that
[1:29:28] just for a moment when a man begins to
[1:29:32] drink in the natural realm and I'm glad
[1:29:35] to have Angels Among
[1:29:37] Us and when he begins to drink in the
[1:29:40] natural
[1:29:41] realm he is trying to
[1:29:43] move from this
[1:29:46] Dimension and trying to forget his
[1:29:52] Sorrows if feel even for a few moments
[1:29:56] what's in that bottle will remove the
[1:30:00] sorrows away from his life even for a
[1:30:04] temporary
[1:30:05] condition I find it amazing I find it
[1:30:10] amazing how that the devil will make you
[1:30:12] pay way more ties than God
[1:30:17] will when you were serving him you
[1:30:20] didn't mind paying $30 or $50 or
[1:30:24] whatever you paid for that
[1:30:28] bottle and so you drank it and then it
[1:30:31] came to an empty spot it didn't take
[1:30:34] away the
[1:30:36] issue the issues were still
[1:30:38] there you were
[1:30:41] sick you had just just destroyed brain
[1:30:45] cells you had made a fool out of
[1:30:49] yourself you wed on the floor you went
[1:30:52] out and wed in the streets am you lost
[1:30:55] control you did things
[1:31:00] that you're ashamed of
[1:31:04] today and then the devil will come along
[1:31:06] you're sitting in church and say
[1:31:07] remember the good old days well what's
[1:31:10] good about that
[1:31:11] [Applause]
[1:31:35] the worst fight I ever had was over
[1:31:37] brother brandom in a
[1:31:40] bar this guy called brother brandom a
[1:31:43] false
[1:31:44] prophet I didn't care if I was
[1:31:47] drunk I still believed he was a prophet
[1:31:54] I'm ashamed of that I never told the
[1:31:55] boys that until they got of
[1:31:58] age cuz I was ashamed I acted like that
[1:32:02] but I'm proud I even in that condition I
[1:32:04] fought for him do you think now at 60
[1:32:08] years
[1:32:09] old I wouldn't fight for him today
[1:32:29] then I saw the life of my parents and
[1:32:32] other people that I knew was Christians
[1:32:35] but
[1:32:37] today it's not alcohol in my system it's
[1:32:41] the life of the
[1:32:43] influence of 100 Proof
[1:32:47] [Applause]
[1:33:05] oh but brother Ron you don't have issues
[1:33:06] now
[1:33:11] really come on really the issues that I
[1:33:14] fight would put most of you guys in a
[1:33:17] panic in 24
[1:33:19] hours but the drunkenness that I'm on
[1:33:22] don't care about cancer don't care about
[1:33:24] sugar
[1:33:26] diabetes don't care about a heart
[1:33:31] attack
[1:33:33] [Applause]
[1:33:48] Hallelujah
[1:33:51] now but brother Ron but when we in the
[1:33:54] message we supposed to quieten
[1:33:58] down
[1:34:00] okay okay well I got a quote for
[1:34:05] you a true p a true picture of the
[1:34:09] modern church
[1:34:11] today neither does the modern church one
[1:34:14] of of these hear screaming shouting Tong
[1:34:17] speaking acts 238 young around her
[1:34:24] the modern Church don't want
[1:34:27] that she don't want any of them whooping
[1:34:29] and crying and screaming amen hallelujah
[1:34:33] why such a child would it be immediately
[1:34:35] put out of her denomination and if they
[1:34:38] had one like that in their churches they
[1:34:40] throw her out real quick why are you
[1:34:42] letting such stuff as this go on along
[1:34:46] so you see she's pregnated with
[1:34:48] something because she's bringing forth
[1:34:50] members all the time but she don't want
[1:34:53] none of these screaming hollering
[1:34:55] blabbering acts 238 miserable creatures
[1:34:57] that she thinks that they
[1:34:59] are it would certainly embarrass
[1:35:04] her it would run her educated ethical
[1:35:09] scientific Society Church that she
[1:35:11] belonged to here they would throw her
[1:35:15] out at the next Council she can't have
[1:35:18] it she don't want to be pregnated with
[1:35:21] the word
[1:35:24] because that's the only kind that the
[1:35:27] word can bring
[1:35:30] [Applause]
[1:35:46] forth I want to be so drunk on the power
[1:35:49] of
[1:35:51] God until this world has no no meaning
[1:35:54] to
[1:35:57] me and I want to be honest with you I'm
[1:36:00] a habitual
[1:36:02] [Music]
[1:36:13] offender I want to say this to you while
[1:36:16] you're dancing I'm not
[1:36:19] embarrassed thank you Lord because this
[1:36:22] quote lives while you're speaking in
[1:36:24] tongues I'm not
[1:36:27] embarrassed while are you screaming and
[1:36:29] standing up while the preaching is going
[1:36:31] on I'm not
[1:36:36] embarrassed that means you feel what I
[1:36:40] feel the same feeling that's on this
[1:36:42] stage is out across this audience
[1:37:00] I want to finish this up maybe I want to
[1:37:02] take this on maybe another week but I
[1:37:04] want to just drop a couple more
[1:37:07] things now here's why this sermon is so
[1:37:12] important we're getting ready to
[1:37:16] leave and I want you to talk to your
[1:37:19] children about it we're getting ready to
[1:37:21] leave
[1:37:23] no we're not going to South
[1:37:28] America we're not going to drink
[1:37:32] Kool-Aid this is not something
[1:37:36] fictitious actually what's happening is
[1:37:39] a worlds are coming
[1:37:43] together and what you see here you see
[1:37:46] people get healed and they're just
[1:37:49] they're just moved into another realm
[1:37:51] and they get a touch
[1:37:53] they get a touch from God and the Holy
[1:37:56] Ghost comes down in their lives and they
[1:37:59] were a
[1:38:01] drunk maybe just a few days
[1:38:04] ago some reason they came to
[1:38:10] church and now now they're citizens of a
[1:38:15] kingdom and because there's a promise of
[1:38:18] the 11th Hour worker they get the same
[1:38:21] pay that the person's been there all the
[1:38:24] [Applause]
[1:38:38] years
[1:38:41] hallelujah

[1:39:46] day another world was coming in the
[1:39:49] building every day and then we come and
[1:39:52] preach and he would go maybe half an
[1:39:55] hour or 45 minutes and talk about last
[1:39:57] night's seal and all of a sudden it
[1:40:00] would break
[1:40:02] loose and there was a lot of people
[1:40:04] sitting in those
[1:40:06] meetings that didn't have a clue what
