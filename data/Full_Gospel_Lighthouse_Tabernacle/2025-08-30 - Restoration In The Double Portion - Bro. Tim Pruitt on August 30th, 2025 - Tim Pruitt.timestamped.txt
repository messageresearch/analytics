[34:33] And you can't turn me. I'm going Jesus.

[34:56] You can't serve me. I know Jesus
[35:02] all the way.
[35:04] &gt;&gt; Sometimes I have to fast and pray.
[35:07] Sometimes I have to steal away.
[35:10] Sometimes I have to cry out, "Help me,
[35:13] Lord."
[35:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, but I know I hold my peace. Well,
[35:18] the Lord has taken care of me. I'm going

[36:37] feet will ground and be caught up with
[36:41] the saints. Oh.

[44:21] Sometimes we begin to think about
[44:23] Enoch's day. We begin to walk God's holy
[44:26] way. I tell you one thing, it begins to
[44:28] put a little air underneath our feet.
[44:30] Hallelujah.

[44:33] their heart?

[44:42] to come by your way here tonight.
[44:44] &gt;&gt; Let him minister to your heart in a very
[44:46] specific way. You come all of this way
[44:48] for these meetings. And I believe that
[44:50] Elohim,

[44:54] this building.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; Some of you need healing in your body.
[44:58] Some of you need deliverance. Some of
[44:59] you need a new birth. I say Elohim is in
[45:02] the building to meet every single one of
[45:04] your needs.

[50:25] Father, in the name of Jesus,
[50:28] we come before your throne of grace. We
[50:31] want to thank you for mercy.
[50:33] We want to thank you for your love and
[50:35] your kindness, Lord, that has brought us

[51:01] and anoint me by your spirit that I can

[51:30] Spirit move and break every feather,
[51:33] every spirit of darkness. We take over
[51:37] every spirit right now in the name of
[51:39] Jesus and we bring it under the
[51:41] authority of the word of God. May the
[51:44] Holy Spirit speak tonight. Lord, we've
[51:46] heard enough from men. We want you to
[51:49] speak
[51:50] &gt;&gt; now. Father, we thank you for what we
[51:53] heard last night
[51:54] &gt;&gt; and the blessings that it was, Lord, and
[51:57] truly we were blessed.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; Now, Lord, we just come here again.
[52:02] We're sitting at your table and yet
[52:04] we're crumb hunters and we take a crumb.
[52:07] But Lord, we're your children and we
[52:09] don't have to take a crumb. We have a
[52:12] seven course menu for all the seven
[52:15] seals are open and the word has been
[52:18] revealed in this hour. Manifest your
[52:21] glory today. Father, I need you. And I'm

[53:11] are. And I'll, you know, I I won't

[54:09] eyes.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; You're his children. And he's here
[54:12] tonight to minister to you in a very
[54:15] special way. He's a God who cares
[54:18] &gt;&gt; and he understands human suffering and
[54:21] human needs. He became a man so he could
[54:24] experience what you go through.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Looking over this audience, I see
[54:28] a lot of cousins out here. It's just a
[54:31] reunion. And you know, I found out
[54:34] Harrisonenberg was named after one of my
[54:36] cousins. So, you know, we got I got
[54:38] relatives all over the sen candida
[54:40] valley that was buried here. I don't
[54:42] know why they didn't stay and kept going
[54:44] toward Texas because it's a lot prettier
[54:46] here. But anyway, we certainly love you
[54:49] and appreciate you. God bless you. Amen.
[54:52] Let's turn to the scripture. Let's go to
[54:54] Second Kings chapter 2 and verse 9. And
[54:57] I want to read together here this word
[55:00] tonight. And just pray that the Lord
[55:02] would help us. Now in 2 Kings 2:9 it
[55:06] says, "And it came to pass when they
[55:09] were gone over that Elijah said unto
[55:11] Elisha, ask what I shall do for thee
[55:15] before I be taken away from thee." And
[55:18] Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double
[55:21] portion of thy spirit be upon me. And he
[55:25] said, Thou hast asked a hard thing.
[55:28] Nevertheless, if thou see me when I am
[55:31] taken from thee, it shall be so unto
[55:34] thee. But if not, it shall not be so.
[55:38] And it came to pass as they went on and
[55:40] talked that behold, there appeared a
[55:44] chariot of fire and horses of fire and
[55:46] and parted them both a thunder. And
[55:49] Elijah went up by a whirlwind into
[55:52] heaven. And Elisha saw it, and he cried,
[55:55] "My father, my father, the chariot of
[55:58] Israel, the horsemen thereof." And he
[56:01] saw him no more. And he took hold of his
[56:03] own clothes, and rent them in two
[56:05] pieces. And he took off also the mantle
[56:09] of Elijah that fell from him, and went
[56:11] back and stood by the bank of the of
[56:14] Jordan. And he took the mantle of Elijah
[56:17] that fell from him and smokeote the
[56:19] waters and said, "Where is the Lord God
[56:23] of Elijah?" And when he had smitten the
[56:26] waters, they parted hither and thither.
[56:29] And Elisha went over. And when the sons
[56:31] of the prophets which were to view at
[56:34] Jericho saw him, they said, "The spirit
[56:38] of Elijah doth rest on Elisha." and they
[56:42] came to meet him and bowed themselves be
[56:47] to the ground before him. God bless you.
[56:50] You can be seated. I want to speak
[56:53] tonight on restoration and the double
[56:56] portion.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; And we're going to speak about Elijah
[57:00] and Elisha tonight because just as
[57:02] Elisha picked up the mantle of Elijah
[57:05] and smoke the waters crying, where is
[57:08] the Lord God of Elijah? So in our day
[57:12] according to Malachi 4:5 and 6, the the
[57:15] spirit of Elijah has come again with the
[57:19] mantle of restoration,
[57:21] &gt;&gt; bringing us back to the faith of our
[57:24] fathers.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; And of course, these these mystery
[57:28] revealed truths. They're not new
[57:30] doctrines. They're they were eternal
[57:32] mysteries that were hidden in God, but
[57:35] are now unveiled to the bride for her
[57:38] final perfection. Right.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; And all we have to do is look back at
[57:42] Elijah and Elisha to know what we must
[57:44] do because they're a prophecy of the end
[57:47] time
[57:48] &gt;&gt; as most every character of the scripture
[57:51] is. As as message believers, we're well
[57:54] aware of Elijah being a prophecy of the
[57:58] end time.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; But sometimes we often overlook the
[58:01] important truth of Elisha's prophecy.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; And these are not just historical
[58:07] accounts. They're they're shadows of
[58:09] what God would do in this last day.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; Now, God would use the Old Testament to
[58:15] foreshadow the new.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; And that's why brother Brandham preached
[58:18] the sermon, Christ is the mystery of God
[58:20] revealed because the coming of Christ
[58:23] and his redemptive plan was foreshadowed
[58:26] in the lives of men and women in the Old
[58:29] Testament because they were prophesying
[58:31] of you. As the Bible said that now all
[58:34] these things happened unto them for
[58:37] examples and they were written for our
[58:40] admonition upon whom the ends of the
[58:43] world are come.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; And here we are right at the end time
[58:47] and we see these scriptures being
[58:49] fulfilled. And you are the embodiment of
[58:52] those scriptures.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; They they were the prophecies. You are
[58:57] the fulfillment.
[58:58] And Isaiah prophesied of a day when the
[59:01] moon would shine like the sun. A
[59:05] prophecy of the bride that would reflect
[59:07] the full light of Christ.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; Isaiah 30:26 said, "Moreover, the light
[59:13] of the moon shall be as the light of the
[59:15] sun, and the light of the sun shall be
[59:18] sevenfold as the light of seven days,
[59:21] &gt;&gt; in the day that the Lord bindeth up the
[59:24] breach of his people, and health the
[59:26] stroke of their wound." Amen.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; And of course, we know the moon
[59:30] represents the bride who reflects the
[59:32] light of the sun.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; And the sevenfold light is the combined
[59:37] of revelation of all the seven ages
[59:40] poured into this final age. That's
[59:42] right.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; And Revelation 10:1 shows we're coming
[59:46] with his face shining like the sun
[59:49] &gt;&gt; in full strength, revealing scriptures
[59:52] that were once hidden in obscurity. for
[59:55] the bride will shine with the same light
[59:57] that Christ had at the beginning.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; And Elijah's ministry, you know, it
[1:00:02] brought a drought on the kingdom of
[1:00:04] Jezebel. You know, a Ahab was only a
[1:00:07] figurehead and and because Jezebel ruled
[1:00:11] and and filled Israel with idolatry.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; And at Mount Carmel, Elijah brought his
[1:00:18] showdown and said, "How long you between
[1:00:21] two opinions? If the Lord be God, then
[1:00:25] follow him. But if veil, then follow
[1:00:28] him.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; And he demonstrated that the gods of
[1:00:31] Jezebel were powerless by calling down
[1:00:35] the fire of the living God.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; So when we look at Elijah, we see first
[1:00:40] he was a restorer of mystery truth. He
[1:00:43] rebuilt the altar of the Lord with 12
[1:00:45] stones. He didn't go and make a new
[1:00:48] religion. He went and got the stones
[1:00:50] that had been discarded and he brought
[1:00:53] them back and he built an altar. He set
[1:00:55] the sacrifice in order and then the fire
[1:00:58] of God came down and consumed it and God
[1:01:02] accepted it.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; So in this age, the stones of truth had
[1:01:07] been scattered by denominationalism.
[1:01:10] Revelation 10:7 declares the seventh
[1:01:13] angel gathers them back into place and
[1:01:16] he finishes the mysteries.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; And the mysteries are the truths of the
[1:01:21] kingdom of heaven.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; The life under the rule of Christ
[1:01:26] through the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; You see Jesus said, "Except a man be
[1:01:32] born again, he cannot see the kingdom of
[1:01:35] God."
[1:01:36] Paul declared that the kingdom of God is
[1:01:39] life in the Holy Ghost when he said in
[1:01:42] Romans 14:17, "For the kingdom of God is
[1:01:46] not meat and drink, but it is
[1:01:48] righteousness, peace, and joy in the
[1:01:51] Holy Ghost."
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, "The kingdom of God
[1:01:55] cometh not with observation, for behold,
[1:01:58] the kingdom of God is within you." Yes.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; And Paul was declaring the kingdom is
[1:02:04] not external religion and arguing about
[1:02:06] what meat you eat
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; or what kind of clothes you wear
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; or those creed. Those are creeds of men.
[1:02:14] But the kingdom of God is the rule of
[1:02:17] Christ in the heart by the Holy Ghost.
[1:02:21] And wherever the spirit rules, there
[1:02:23] will be righteousness, joy, and peace.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The kingdom of God is not
[1:02:31] trees. It is not thorns. It is not sex.
[1:02:34] It is a life in the Holy Ghost.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; And true conversion brings you under
[1:02:41] Christ's government.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; His word ruling then in your heart.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; You know the parables of Jesus, the wise
[1:02:50] and the foolish virgins, the weed and
[1:02:52] the terrors and all of these that he
[1:02:54] called the mysteries of the kingdom,
[1:02:56] they all show the mysteries. Only
[1:02:59] through the baptism of the Holy Ghost do
[1:03:01] we enter into it.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; And this is why we are not following
[1:03:06] cunningly devised fables,
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; nor just interpretations of men. But but
[1:03:13] you see we we are standing in the
[1:03:16] fulfillment of prophecy
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; where the bride reflects the sun with
[1:03:21] sevenfold light
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; restored to the original altar filled
[1:03:26] with the true baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:03:28] and ready for a rapture.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not called to reformation
[1:03:34] but to restoration.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; We are not called to human
[1:03:38] interpretation but to spirit and truth.
[1:03:42] Elijah has come. The altar has been
[1:03:45] rebuilt. The fire has fallen. And now
[1:03:48] the bride must walk across Jordan with
[1:03:51] the mantel of Christ shining with the
[1:03:54] full light of the sun.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; Jesus asked the question as to why he
[1:04:01] presented much of the word in in
[1:04:03] parables and symbolic form that men
[1:04:06] can't fully grasp without revelation
[1:04:09] given by the spirit. He said in Matthew
[1:04:12] 13:11, he said, "Because it is given to
[1:04:16] you
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; to know the mysteries of the kingdom of
[1:04:19] heaven,
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; but to them it is not given."
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; Now, I just want to just cover a few of
[1:04:26] the mystery truths that have been
[1:04:29] restored. I I couldn't get them all
[1:04:30] tonight, but I just want to go through a
[1:04:33] few and keep in mind that so these are
[1:04:36] some of the stones of truth that Elijah
[1:04:38] restores that must be in our altar of
[1:04:42] worship.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; There you go.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; Now, of course, one of the mystery
[1:04:47] truths is there is but one God,
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; not two or three.
[1:04:52] And the greatest revelation of all is
[1:04:56] the supreme deity of the Lord Jesus
[1:04:59] Christ.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; God was in Christ reconciling the world
[1:05:03] to himself.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; And Paul said plainly, "For in him
[1:05:07] dwelleth the fullness of the Godhead
[1:05:09] bodily."
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; Jesus declared, "The Son can do nothing
[1:05:13] himself, but the Father dwelleth in me.
[1:05:16] He doeth the works."
[1:05:18] So the eternal father, the spirit lived
[1:05:21] in him, expressing himself through the
[1:05:23] world.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; Now, Satan hates his truth.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; He hates his truth.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; Satan has always hated the revelation of
[1:05:32] God in Christ.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; That is why he constantly tries to
[1:05:37] distort deity.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; There you go.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; How does he do that? By exalting men
[1:05:43] above Christ. Yeah.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; By deifying prophets or leaders.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; By reducing Jesus Christ to just a man
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; or only an elder brother.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Even in our day, Satan has even
[1:05:58] tried to make brother Brandham equal
[1:05:59] with Christ.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; Claiming he was God in the flesh or that
[1:06:04] every word that he said was thus sayeth
[1:06:06] the Lord. That's not the spirit of
[1:06:08] Christ. That's anity spirit.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; It's a demonic distortion.
[1:06:13] Brother Brandham was a man. He wasn't
[1:06:16] God.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham was a prophet, a human
[1:06:19] being chosen by God.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; Anointed with the spirit of Christ.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; The same spirit that rested upon Elijah.
[1:06:28] And his commission was to declare the
[1:06:30] message of restoration to this last
[1:06:33] generation.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; But he was still a man.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; That's right, sir.
[1:06:38] Now his voice was an instrument God
[1:06:42] used.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; The word came through him but he himself
[1:06:46] was not the word.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; To deify every word he spoke is to deify
[1:06:51] his humanity and make him go
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; which he never claimed to be.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; And to make this claim is antichrist. It
[1:07:00] is the poison of the serpent.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; Now I just want you to consider John the
[1:07:06] Baptist. You know he was also Elijah.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; And the scripture said he came in the
[1:07:11] spirit in the power of Elias.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; He was the voice of one crying in the
[1:07:16] wilderness.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; How many believe that?
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; But note carefully. John was the voice,
[1:07:22] not the one crying.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; God was the one crying to his people.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; And John was simply the voice box.
[1:07:33] He pointed to the lamb of God saying,
[1:07:35] "He must increase and I must decrease."
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; And yet when John was in prison, he sent
[1:07:43] his disciples to ask Jesus, "Are thou
[1:07:46] the one or shall we do we look for
[1:07:48] another?" You see, that was a man
[1:07:50] speaking, a prophet, a human
[1:07:53] questioning, wrestling with doubt. John
[1:07:56] was God's chosen vessel, but he was
[1:07:59] still a human that was subject to
[1:08:01] weakness. John was not the voice of God.
[1:08:05] He was a voice that God used.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; Likewise, brother Brandham was not the
[1:08:10] voice of God. He was a man whose voice
[1:08:13] God used.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; And the same is true. God still anoints
[1:08:18] men.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; But the but the anointing is not the
[1:08:22] man.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; The prophet is the voice, but Christ is
[1:08:27] the word. And the spirit rushing on
[1:08:29] Elijah, on John, on brother Brandham was
[1:08:32] the spirit of Christ. But the vessel was
[1:08:35] human.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; So that means the greatest revelation
[1:08:40] still remains unshaken. The supreme
[1:08:44] revelation
[1:08:45] of of is unchanged. God was in Christ
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; reconciling the world to himself. Not
[1:08:53] God in Moses, not God in Paul, not God
[1:08:56] in brother Brandham. It was God in
[1:08:59] Christ.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; And Moses was God's servant. Paul was
[1:09:04] God's messenger. Brother Brandham was
[1:09:06] God's prophet. But only Jesus Christ was
[1:09:10] the fullness of the Godhead bodily.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; And in and in the unveiling of God,
[1:09:16] brother Brandon makes the distinction.
[1:09:17] And he said, "Now we find here now since
[1:09:20] Pentecost, God is not acting in man.
[1:09:23] He's acting through man. He was acting
[1:09:27] in a man then, Jesus. And he's acting
[1:09:29] through a man that he has chosen. Now he
[1:09:33] is acting through a man that he has
[1:09:34] chosen for this purpose." Notice in
[1:09:37] Jesus Christ, God acted in a man. He was
[1:09:42] Emmanuel,
[1:09:44] God with us. Right?
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; The word became flesh
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; and dwelt among us. But since Pentecost,
[1:09:53] God acts through man.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; He anoints his prophets, his apostles,
[1:10:00] his preachers, but he doesn't incarnate
[1:10:03] himself in them.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; The vessel is human and the anointing is
[1:10:08] divine.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; Now, why does this distinction matter?
[1:10:12] Because Satan always tries to blur this
[1:10:15] line. He wants to exalt man into Godhood
[1:10:20] and reduce Jesus Christ to mere
[1:10:23] humanity. And both are errors.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; To deify Paul or Moses or brother
[1:10:29] Brandham is idolatry.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; To to deny the deity of Jesus Christ is
[1:10:36] heresy.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; Even brother Brandham warned against
[1:10:42] this. He was a man, a prophet, chosen,
[1:10:45] vindicated, but not God.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; He was a voice.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; But the voice was carrying God's word.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; As John was the voice of one crying in
[1:10:57] the wilderness. Yet the cry itself was
[1:11:00] God's cry to his people.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; Now the Bible is plain. Colossians 1:19
[1:11:07] says, "For it pleased the Father that in
[1:11:11] him should all the fullness dwell."
[1:11:14] Amen. It says in Colossians 2:9, "In him
[1:11:17] dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead
[1:11:20] bodily."
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; There is no prophet, no apostle, no
[1:11:24] messenger can ever hold that position.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; Only Christ is the incarnate God, the
[1:11:30] lamb of God, the word made flesh. So the
[1:11:33] greatest revelation stands firm. God was
[1:11:36] in Christ and today he works through men
[1:11:41] and a portion of his spirit dwelleth in
[1:11:43] them anointing them for his purpose. But
[1:11:46] the fullness dwelt in Jesus Christ
[1:11:50] alone.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; That same Christ by the Holy Ghost now
[1:11:55] indwells the bride. Not making her God,
[1:11:59] but his body on earth, reflecting his
[1:12:02] word and his life until the rapture.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You see, Jesus was both God
[1:12:09] and man. He was more than a human vessel
[1:12:12] that God filled. He was truly man, but
[1:12:16] he was also truly God.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; He was the word made flesh.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. His body was not like any other
[1:12:24] body. For it was a body hast thou
[1:12:28] prepared me?
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; Hebrews 10:5. God created that body for
[1:12:33] his own dwelling.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus was virgin born. His father
[1:12:38] God almighty, not Joseph.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; Mary was a chosen vessel, but she was
[1:12:44] not the source.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; She was the incubator.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; The life came from God. The germ of
[1:12:50] life, the very creative act was divine.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; As Luke says, and he records the angel's
[1:12:57] announce announcement, the Holy Ghost
[1:12:59] shall come upon thee, and the power of
[1:13:02] the highest shall overshadow thee.
[1:13:04] Therefore also that holy thing that
[1:13:06] shall be born of thee shall be called
[1:13:09] the son of God.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; And let me tell you about his blood. His
[1:13:14] blood was not Jewish blood.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. Not gentile
[1:13:18] blood.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; It wasn't even human blood. It was God
[1:13:22] himself.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; Paul declared to the elders of Ephesus,
[1:13:27] "Feed the church of God, which he has
[1:13:29] purchased with his own blood."
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Peter said, "We are not redeemed
[1:13:34] by the blood of a man, nor by
[1:13:37] corruptible things as silver or gold,
[1:13:40] but with the precious blood of Christ,
[1:13:42] as a lamb without blemish and without
[1:13:45] spot.
[1:13:47] Hallelujah. It is this divine blood,
[1:13:51] holy, pure, and undefiled, that brings
[1:13:54] salvation.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; No other blood can save you.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; If his blood had been the blood of a
[1:14:01] mere man, it could not atone for the
[1:14:04] sins of the world.
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; But it was the blood of Emanuel. It was
[1:14:09] God with us.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; That's right. And that's why the prophet
[1:14:12] Isaiah said in Isaiah 96, "Unto us a
[1:14:16] child is born. Unto us a son is given
[1:14:19] and his name shall be called wonderful
[1:14:21] and counselor, the mighty God, the
[1:14:24] everlasting father, the prince of
[1:14:27] peace."
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; We are not saved by the blood of
[1:14:36] Joseph's son. We're not saved by the
[1:14:39] blood of of Adam's race, but we are
[1:14:42] saved by the blood of God himself.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you tonight, that blood
[1:14:48] speaks better things than the blood of
[1:14:51] Abel.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. This blood cleanses from our sin.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; That's the reason why tonight, the bride
[1:14:59] of Christ stands justified, sanctified,
[1:15:03] filled with the Holy Ghost.
[1:15:06] Hallelujah.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; But when we're speaking of the
[1:15:13] messenger,
[1:15:14] let's never confuse the vessel with the
[1:15:18] God who filled it.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; God, you know, John was a was a man.
[1:15:23] Brother Brandham was a man, but Jesus
[1:15:26] Christ is God.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; And the same spirit that dwelt in him
[1:15:31] now dwells in the bride.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; That's right. preparing her for
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; So, here's another stone right here that
[1:15:40] we want to see that was laid in this
[1:15:44] altar because it's where we come to
[1:15:47] worship.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; And the restored church knows there is
[1:15:51] no other name given among men whereby we
[1:15:55] must be saved.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; Salvation is not in titles. It is not in
[1:16:00] creeds. is not in denominations but it's
[1:16:04] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:16:10] From the very beginning apostles
[1:16:13] baptized every convert in the name of
[1:16:15] Jesus Christ. On the day of Pentecost,
[1:16:18] Peter declared, "Repent and be baptized
[1:16:21] every one of you in the name of Jesus
[1:16:24] Christ for remission of sin." The
[1:16:26] Samaritans in Luke 8:16 were baptized in
[1:16:30] the name of the Lord Jesus. In Acts
[1:16:32] 10:48, Cornelius's household was
[1:16:35] commanded to be baptized in the name of
[1:16:38] the Lord. In Acts 19:5, Paul rebapt
[1:16:42] rebaptized the disciples at Ephesus in
[1:16:45] the name of the Lord Jesus.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; And there is no record in the scripture
[1:16:50] of being baptized any other way.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; That's right. Baptism in his name is not
[1:16:58] ritual.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; It is an identification.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; Paul declared, "Know you not that so
[1:17:04] many of us that were baptized into Jesus
[1:17:07] Christ were baptized into his death.
[1:17:10] Therefore, we are buried with him by
[1:17:11] baptism into death, that like as Christ
[1:17:14] was raised up from the dead, even so we
[1:17:16] should walk in the newness of life."
[1:17:18] Amen.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; And so when we are baptized in his name,
[1:17:23] we publicly identify with his death, his
[1:17:28] burial, his resurrection.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; By invoking his name, we declare our
[1:17:36] place in the family
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; of whom the whole family in heaven and
[1:17:41] earth is named.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That is our family name.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; And let me tell you there is power in
[1:17:51] that name.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; This name is not just a sound. It
[1:17:56] carries authority.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; He is Jesus. Jehovah Savior. The angel
[1:18:03] declared, "Thou shalt call his name
[1:18:06] Jesus."
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; Which means Jehovah Savior, for he will
[1:18:11] save his people from their sins.
[1:18:15] I'll tell you tonight, in his name,
[1:18:18] demons tremble. In his name, sick are
[1:18:21] healed. In his name, the church prays
[1:18:25] and they prevail. In his name, the bride
[1:18:29] is identified as his own.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:18:41] The restored church does not compromise
[1:18:44] on this truth.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; We are baptized in the name above every
[1:18:49] name.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; The only name by which we under heaven
[1:18:53] by which we are saved.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; The name that heaven recognized
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; that hell fears
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; that the bride bears.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ Jehovah our savior.
[1:19:07] Let me tell you another stone of truth
[1:19:10] that must be in our altar of worship.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; The baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; Not a sensation,
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; not a tongue,
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; not an emotion, not a chill, not a
[1:19:24] shout, but the very life of God
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; indwelling the believer. Jesus said, "I
[1:19:32] will come to you." And the Holy Ghost is
[1:19:34] Christ in you, enabling you to live his
[1:19:38] word and perform his works.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you of another stone. The
[1:19:47] security of the believer.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; Not once for this false one saved always
[1:19:53] saved that excuses sins, but a sealing
[1:19:57] unto the day of redemption.
[1:20:00] Hallelujah. The spirit does not come and
[1:20:02] go. He abides.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; He abides with you forever.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; And the proof that his life governs you
[1:20:11] and brings you under subjection to his
[1:20:14] word. And it keeps you walking
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; in holiness.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; Let's talk about another real quick.
[1:20:23] Election and predestination.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; Here's another stone in this altar.
[1:20:28] Ephesians 1:4 says, "According as he
[1:20:30] hath chosen us in him before the
[1:20:34] foundation of the world."
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. The bride is the offspring of God.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; His very gene expressed in time.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; This unveils eternity itself. says as 1
[1:20:48] Timothy 6:16 presents 6:16 presents God
[1:20:52] as who only hath immortality
[1:20:56] eternal life belongs to God
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; to God alone
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; and to those that receive it from him.
[1:21:02] Therefore, hell cannot be eternal
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; otherwise it would make Satan and sin
[1:21:12] equal with God.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. The fire is eternal, but the
[1:21:18] destruction of the wicked is complete.
[1:21:21] For the soul that sinnth, it shall die.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; So here's another stone in our altar of
[1:21:31] worship.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ the same yesterday,
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; today, and forever.
[1:21:39] that he's here,
[1:21:41] not in his body, his corporal body of
[1:21:44] flesh, but in spirit. And he's living in
[1:21:47] his bride. And the very works that he
[1:21:50] did, she does.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; The groom and the bride are one.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; That brings us to another stone. The
[1:22:00] mystery of the bride.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; The wise virgins separated from the
[1:22:04] foolish. Yeah,
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; both are virgins.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; But one has oil and the other does not.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; The wise are taken into the rapture. The
[1:22:13] foolish go in the tribulation for
[1:22:15] virgin.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; The bride knows her identity and she's
[1:22:19] preparing for the marriage supper of the
[1:22:21] lamb.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's another stone of truth
[1:22:25] which is the mystery of iniquity. From
[1:22:28] the serpent seed in Eden to Satan
[1:22:32] enthroned is the god to this evil age.
[1:22:35] Satan too has a bride. She is called
[1:22:39] mystery Babylon the great, the mother of
[1:22:41] harlots.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. He sits in the temple of God,
[1:22:45] worshiped as God.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; I'm quoting 2 Thessalonians 2:3 and 4.
[1:22:50] This is the age of deception.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; But it's the day when the man of sin is
[1:22:56] exposed.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; That's right. for what he is.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; The center of producing
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; and you and I tonight because of a
[1:23:04] restored truth.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; We can trace him all the way from the
[1:23:09] heavens all the way through Eden all the
[1:23:11] way to his end in the lake of fire. We
[1:23:15] can trail that serpent all the way. We
[1:23:17] can identify his deception through the
[1:23:20] ages. But I'm telling you, you will not
[1:23:23] be deceived. You are predestinated
[1:23:26] to stand in this evil age.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you of another stone of
[1:23:36] truth. The seven church ages and their
[1:23:40] messengers.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; There are seven stars that are seven
[1:23:44] messengers to the seven churches as
[1:23:47] shown in Revelation chapter 1 and 20.
[1:23:50] These ages span the entire gentile
[1:23:52] dispensation.
[1:23:54] The bride has been gathered out of every
[1:23:56] age culminating in the Leodysian age
[1:24:00] bringing in the fullness of the
[1:24:02] Gentiles.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you of another
[1:24:06] real important stone in our altar of
[1:24:09] worship. The return of the pillar of
[1:24:12] fire.
[1:24:15] The same one who met Moses, sir,
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; who struck Paul down and blind on the
[1:24:22] road to Damascus. He has returned in
[1:24:25] this last day.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; And he alone, listen to me now, he
[1:24:30] alone, not theologians, not schools of
[1:24:33] learning,
[1:24:34] he alone is the source of all revelation
[1:24:38] and true understanding.
[1:24:42] The pillar of fire vindicates the word.
[1:24:45] He is the revealer of every mystery.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; It is the same one who struck Saul down
[1:24:50] on the road to Damascus and said, "I am
[1:24:53] Jesus."
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; So the pillar of fire is none other than
[1:24:58] the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; He's the author. He knew the book.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; That's why he could reveal it to the
[1:25:08] messenger.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. Brother Brandham's
[1:25:11] claim was not, "I know all the books
[1:25:14] well, but I know the author
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; real well."
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; Here's another one. The seven thunders
[1:25:23] of Revelation 10. When they sounded,
[1:25:26] they revealed the mysteries hidden in
[1:25:29] the seven seals.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; And the prophet declared they were
[1:25:33] revealed in the seven seals. That's what
[1:25:35] the thunders was about. You see, this is
[1:25:38] the food that gives the bride strength
[1:25:41] for the rapture in faith.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, let me give you another one.
[1:25:45] The spirit of Elijah restored.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; For he said, Malachi 4 I5, behold, I
[1:25:52] send you Elijah the prophet before the
[1:25:55] coming of the great and dreadful day of
[1:25:57] the Lord.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; And I want you to know this spirit has
[1:26:01] returned in our generation,
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; bringing full restoration. That's right.
[1:26:06] and full redemption
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; turning the hearts of the children back
[1:26:11] to the apostolic fathers.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; And I want to say brother Brandon was
[1:26:16] not merely a five-fold minister.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; No one else had such vindication.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; His gift of discernment was not one of
[1:26:25] the gifts among nine.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; It was the ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:26:31] repeated.
[1:26:32] It vindicated that he was the seventh
[1:26:35] angel messenger
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; of Revelation 10:7, the promised Elijah
[1:26:39] to this day. Let me just quote him from
[1:26:42] the voice of the sign. And he said, "Now
[1:26:44] we find out these men go out sometimes
[1:26:46] and then the people begin to press upon
[1:26:48] them." Oh brother, what will you say?
[1:26:52] See, if he goes by impression, see the
[1:26:55] way he feels, why the Lord will do that.
[1:26:58] Thus say the Lord, that's a lie. You
[1:27:01] can't say thus sayaeth the Lord
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; until God in his own language has spoke
[1:27:06] to you and told you that and then is not
[1:27:10] you saying it is not your impression.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; The Bible said if a prophet did that was
[1:27:16] going on presumptuously and that's
[1:27:18] presuming and to presume is to venture
[1:27:20] without authority he's going up on his
[1:27:22] own. But when you see the man speaking
[1:27:26] what is going to happen in the name of
[1:27:28] the Lord and it happens day in and out,
[1:27:31] week in and out, month in and out, year
[1:27:34] in and out, then you know that had to
[1:27:37] come from God. That's God's credentials
[1:27:41] to the man that he is the interpreter of
[1:27:44] the written word for that day
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; because God sent the man to do it.
[1:27:50] That's right.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; Now, these mysteries that have been
[1:27:55] revealed to us, and I just spoke of, and
[1:27:58] I'm not necessarily counting each one
[1:28:00] and say, "Oh, they're one of the 12,"
[1:28:02] but they're the mysteries that have been
[1:28:04] restored to us that are not detached
[1:28:07] stones
[1:28:09] of doctrine. They're the great unveiling
[1:28:12] of the the once sealed book.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; You see, Isaiah saw it in a vision.
[1:28:19] Isaiah 29:11, "The vision of all has
[1:28:23] become to you as the words of a book
[1:28:26] that is sealed."
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; You see, some could not read it because
[1:28:32] it was sealed. Others could not read it
[1:28:35] because they were unlearned. The
[1:28:38] prophets, the rulers, they were all
[1:28:40] covered in a deep sleep according to
[1:28:42] Isaiah 29. Yet God promised, "I will
[1:28:45] proceed to do a marvelous work." the
[1:28:48] wisdom of their wise men shall perish.
[1:28:51] And this marvelous work is the opening
[1:28:54] of the seven seals when the book was
[1:28:57] unsealed to the bride in this last day.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; You see, with the seals on the book, the
[1:29:03] the book remained closed.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; But when Christ broke them, the hidden
[1:29:08] mysteries were open to us.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I tell you, if you still got
[1:29:15] one seal left on the book, it's still a
[1:29:18] closed book.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; But we are feasting from a seven course
[1:29:23] menu.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; For all the seven seals have been
[1:29:28] revealed. The book is now open. It's no
[1:29:32] longer closed.
[1:29:34] We're not guessing and probing and
[1:29:37] wondering.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; We're a people of revelation.
[1:29:43] Amen. Because Christ broke the seals and
[1:29:47] the mysteries were open to us.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; From the open of the seals came one of
[1:29:53] the most
[1:29:55] important sermons of all,
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; the supreme token.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham declared it was the
[1:30:04] highlight of my entire ministry.
[1:30:09] Every sermon, he said, had been pointing
[1:30:11] to this.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; Why? Because everything, every mystery,
[1:30:16] every doctrine, every stone of truth
[1:30:18] points to the lamb and his blood.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; Elijah when he restored the altar on
[1:30:26] Mount Carmel Carmel, he he did not just
[1:30:29] lay 12 stones in in order. No, he placed
[1:30:33] the sacrifice upon them. It was the
[1:30:36] sacrifice and the fire from heaven that
[1:30:38] proved that the God of Israel was alive.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; So it is today that that Christ Jesus,
[1:30:46] the lamb slain, the Holy Ghost, his very
[1:30:50] life. It must be the center of our
[1:30:53] worship.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; The token, the true baptism of the Holy
[1:30:59] Ghost.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; It is not optional.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; It is the focal point of worship. Amen.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; True worship cannot revolve around just
[1:31:12] beautifully laid stones of mystery
[1:31:14] truths
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; that merely impart knowledge to you.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. The doctrines are necessary.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. But without the lamb,
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; without the blood,
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; without the Holy Ghost upon them, they
[1:31:28] are lifeless.
[1:31:30] You see, the life must flow over every
[1:31:34] stone.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; And then the fire falls to vindicate the
[1:31:39] altar. It consumes the sacrifice. It
[1:31:42] accepts both the lamb and the stones
[1:31:45] upon which he is laid. For our God is a
[1:31:49] consuming fire.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; We must have the fire.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; Did you hear me tonight? We must have
[1:31:56] the fire. Without the fire, even the
[1:32:00] altar,
[1:32:01] think about it, even the altar with this
[1:32:04] offering will soon become a stench in
[1:32:06] God's nostrils.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Isa Amos 5:21 prophesies, "I hate,
[1:32:14] I despise your feast days. I will not
[1:32:17] smell in your solemn assemblies
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; because offerings without the fire of
[1:32:22] the Holy Ghost is rejected."
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[1:32:26] The fire must fall to accept the
[1:32:29] offering.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; It is the spirit that gives life,
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; not the form.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; Without the spirit, worship is just
[1:32:38] empty formality.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; With the spirit, it's a living reality.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I want the
[1:32:46] spirit.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; I say, let the fire fall.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. We got the stones. We have the
[1:32:52] sacrifice. We have the truth. We have
[1:32:55] the lamb, but let the fire fall.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; Therefore, the restored church must not
[1:33:08] only gather the stones of truth and
[1:33:11] place the sacrifice of the lamb. She
[1:33:13] must also have the fire from heaven.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; Only then is worship complete. That's
[1:33:19] right.
[1:33:20] Amen.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you, without the fire,
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; Elijah's altar was no different from
[1:33:27] Baal's.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; And without the fire of the Holy Ghost,
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; consuming your old life,
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; come on.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Without the fire falling. Come on.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Your offering is no different from
[1:33:45] Baales.
[1:33:47] but to prove it as an altar of Jehovah.
[1:33:50] The fire falls
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; consumes a sacrifice.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; We must have the fire from heaven.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; Cuz only then is worship complete.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; Only then is the altar vindicated.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; Only then does God declare his
[1:34:11] acceptance.
[1:34:12] For the kingdom of God is not in word
[1:34:15] but in power.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; That's why we preach restored Bible
[1:34:20] truths because only when the word and
[1:34:23] the spirit unite do we see the works of
[1:34:26] Christ reproduced in our day.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; When a Bible Jesus is preached
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; with Bible holiness,
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. and Bible doctrine. That's right.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; Then the fire falls.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; And when the fire falls, sick are
[1:34:40] healed.
[1:34:41] Captives are set free. Saints are
[1:34:44] filled. Amen. That's worship in spirit
[1:34:47] and in truth.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; So as the altar is restored as and the
[1:34:55] fire fell in Elijah's day, I want you to
[1:34:58] know not only was there fire, but there
[1:35:01] was rain
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; and rain came bringing refreshing
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; and restoration.
[1:35:11] Amen.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; So in the seventh age, a cloud appears
[1:35:15] in the heavens. Seven mighty angels.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; Declaring the time of refreshing had
[1:35:21] come.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; You're not waiting on it.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; You are right here.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; In the pouring out of God's spirit.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; It is the moment. It's the time. Hosea
[1:35:33] prophesied of this rain saying his going
[1:35:36] forth is prepared as a m morning and he
[1:35:40] shall come to us as the rain and as the
[1:35:43] latter and former reign. Listen part of
[1:35:46] his coming
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; is the rain.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; You say I want Jesus to come back. Well,
[1:35:54] he's got to come back first and bring
[1:35:56] the rain to bring restoration.
[1:36:02] Hallelujah. Joel echoed it. He
[1:36:04] prophesied the former and latter rain
[1:36:07] would fall together. And with that with
[1:36:10] that with that falling of the rain, that
[1:36:13] restoration of what had been devoured
[1:36:15] would be restored.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. The result the result you know the
[1:36:22] result of the rain falling, the flowers
[1:36:25] shall be full of wheat.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; That's right. And the the the bat shall
[1:36:29] overflow with wine and oil.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. That that is the result of the
[1:36:43] rain falling.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. The floor shall be full of wheat.
[1:36:47] Look around you. Grain. Grain. Grain.
[1:36:51] Separated from the shop. Grain.
[1:36:54] Hallelujah. But with that,
[1:36:57] is oil. With that is wine.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And oil and wine goes
[1:37:05] together in worship. So there's worship.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; When the rain falls,
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; everybody's happy.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; The drought is over.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; Smiles on the face, rejoicing, shouting.
[1:37:23] Look, the rain.
[1:37:29] This is restoration rain.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; Bringing back the harvest, filling the
[1:37:36] bride with word and spirit.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; That's the truth.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; Now
[1:37:52] the book was sealed and hidden down
[1:37:54] through the ages.
[1:37:56] At the seventh seal, the mysteries were
[1:37:59] opened. The token was revealed as the
[1:38:02] heart of all worship, Christ's life, the
[1:38:05] Holy Ghost. The fire falls to consume
[1:38:10] and vindicate both the lamb and the
[1:38:12] doctrine.
[1:38:14] And the fire falls to restore. The rain
[1:38:16] falls to restore bringing a double
[1:38:20] portion. Listen now the former and
[1:38:23] latter rain together.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; Right
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; now as Elijah restored the altar, called
[1:38:31] the fire and then brought the rain. So
[1:38:33] in this last day, the spirit of Elijah
[1:38:36] has restored the word,
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; revealed the mysteries,
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; and is now bringing the reign of
[1:38:42] restoration and spirit and power to
[1:38:44] prepare the bride for her rapture.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; You're not leaving here a defeated bunch
[1:38:50] of people.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; You're not leaving here cast down and
[1:38:55] weary and depressed. Now you're going
[1:38:58] out here a victorious church without a
[1:39:01] spot wrinkle.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; So along with the restoration of the
[1:39:13] altar and its mystery truth, Elijah
[1:39:18] brings the rain.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; First Kings 18:43. and and he said unto
[1:39:23] his servant, "Go up now and look toward
[1:39:26] the sea." And he went up and looked, and
[1:39:28] he said, "There's nothing." He said, "Go
[1:39:32] again seven times."
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; And it came to pass,
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; at the seventh time,
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; that he said, "Behold, there arises a
[1:39:43] little cloud out of the sea,
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; like a man's hand." And he said, "Go up,
[1:39:49] say to Ahab, prepare thy chariot, and
[1:39:51] get thee down, that the rain stopped
[1:39:54] thee not." And it came to pass in the
[1:39:56] meanwhile that the heavens were black
[1:39:58] with the clouds and the wind, and there
[1:40:00] was a great rain.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to preach.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; All of that was preliminary.
[1:40:17] Look at the parallel just for a moment.
[1:40:20] In the seventh time, in the seventh age,
[1:40:24] it came out as a cloud, a sign in the
[1:40:26] heavens with seven angels.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; Hosea 6 and3 said, "If we follow on to
[1:40:33] know the Lord, oh that we might know the
[1:40:35] Lord.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; Let us press on to know him, his coming,
[1:40:39] his going forth is prepared as the
[1:40:41] morning." Amen. And he shall come on
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; unto us as the rain, the former, the
[1:40:48] latter and former reign unto the earth.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; His coming
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; will be as the rain.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; Joel said, "Be glad then, you children
[1:40:58] of Zion." In 2:23, and rejoice in the
[1:41:01] Lord your God, for he has given you the
[1:41:03] former rain moderately, and he will
[1:41:05] cause to come down for you the rain, the
[1:41:07] former rain, and the latter rain in the
[1:41:09] first month. And the floor shall be full
[1:41:11] of wheat and the fats shall overflow
[1:41:12] with wine and oil. And I will restore to
[1:41:15] you the years that the locust is eaten.
[1:41:17] The canker worm, the caterpillar, the
[1:41:18] the palm of worm. My great army I sent
[1:41:21] among you,
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; brother Brandham. In resurrection of
[1:41:23] Jesus Christ, he said, "Do you know the
[1:41:25] scriptures must be fil fulfilled?" God
[1:41:28] has to appear in this last day to do the
[1:41:31] things he's doing now. It's to fulfill
[1:41:34] the scripture. And it shall come to pass
[1:41:37] in the last days I will pour out my
[1:41:39] spirit. And remember he said there would
[1:41:42] be a former reign and a latter rain. And
[1:41:45] in the latter rain both the former and
[1:41:47] latter rain would come together a double
[1:41:49] portion.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; And then if we see what the former rain
[1:41:54] produce, how much more would the latter
[1:41:56] rain produce? And when he pours out his
[1:41:58] spirit, there will be signs and wonders
[1:42:00] take place. I was speaking not long ago.
[1:42:03] When omnipotent speaks, miracles happen.
[1:42:06] It has to.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; So, shouldn't we see the cloud of the
[1:42:11] latter rain?
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. John wrote, "Behold, he cometh
[1:42:15] with clouds."
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; Hosea said, "His coming would be as the
[1:42:19] former and latter rain." Zachchariah
[1:42:22] spoke of bright clouds of the latter
[1:42:24] rain. In our day, we've seen the cloud
[1:42:28] of his appearing.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; Not a natural vapor,
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; but a supernatural sign in the heavens,
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; a cloud formed by seven angels,
[1:42:37] declaring the seals are open,
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; that redemption is complete, and that
[1:42:42] the headstone Christ himself was
[1:42:45] descending to unite with his body, the
[1:42:48] bride.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And let me tell you,
[1:42:52] everywhere that that clouds, that cloud
[1:42:56] spreads, it brings rain.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And when it rains, it
[1:43:02] restores.
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; What was dead and dry springs back to
[1:43:06] life.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; Dead grass turns green. Dead trees puts
[1:43:11] forth new branches. Lays begin to clap
[1:43:14] their hands. The breeze of the spirit
[1:43:17] begins to blow. Hallelujah. Why? The
[1:43:21] rain has fallen. And when it rains, it
[1:43:24] restores you. It refreshes you.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; I'm looking at men and women today who
[1:43:33] were once dead in sins and trespasses,
[1:43:38] but the rain of his spirit, he rained on
[1:43:42] you and he brought you life.
[1:43:49] Some of you were old in an old cold dead
[1:43:52] dark tomb somewhere of religion. But the
[1:43:56] rain
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; resurrected you to life.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what it is. It's the
[1:44:06] rushing mighty wind of the Holy Ghost.
[1:44:09] It's a cloud of seven angels. It's
[1:44:11] showing the fullness of redemption. It
[1:44:13] makes up the head of Christ. It is
[1:44:16] Christ revealing himself from heaven
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; in these last days.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; And let me tell you, this is no ordinary
[1:44:25] rain.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. It is both the teaching rain and
[1:44:29] the harvest rain. It is the latter rain
[1:44:32] that brings forth the ripen fruit. Amen.
[1:44:35] Producing a word bride
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; in this last day.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; This is a time of restoration. Yeah,
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; we know God sent one in the spirit and
[1:44:44] the power of Elijah. How many believes
[1:44:46] that?
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; What was to do? To turn the hearts of
[1:44:49] the children back to the faith.
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; The Elijah anointing is the spirit of
[1:44:54] Christ himself.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; It's given five different times for
[1:45:00] different works of restoration.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; Let's talk about that just briefly.
[1:45:06] Elijah, we know we read about he
[1:45:08] restores the altar of the Lord in
[1:45:11] Israel. He turns the hearts from Baal to
[1:45:14] Jehovah. Elisha will continue with the
[1:45:17] double portion showing the continuation
[1:45:20] of the same spirit.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; John the Baptist came in the spirit of
[1:45:24] Elijah to turn the hearts of the fathers
[1:45:28] to the children to the apostles to Jesus
[1:45:32] preparing the way for Christ. Malachi 4,
[1:45:36] uh, Elijah comes to the the Gentiles in
[1:45:39] the last day, turning the hearts of the
[1:45:41] children in back to the apostolic
[1:45:44] fathers.
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; The fifth coming of Elijah will be in
[1:45:47] the tribulation, joined with the spirit
[1:45:49] of Moses, pointing the 144,000 Jews back
[1:45:53] to the original atonement.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; And there will not be another there will
[1:45:58] never be another Elijah to the Gentiles.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; That's right. The one man scriptures and
[1:46:05] prophecies have been fulfilled.
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; One man ministries are over.
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; It is now a body ministry.
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. I I know. I know. I there's
[1:46:28] been many already that stood up to claim
[1:46:31] they've already taken brother Brandon's
[1:46:32] place and claims his mantel.
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; That's because impersonators just like
[1:46:39] Janice and Jambers
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; withtood Moses
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; because this is an age where
[1:46:44] impersonators are prevalent.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; When brother Brandham went forth after
[1:46:49] the angel's visitation in 1946, there
[1:46:52] were hundreds
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; hundreds went up rose up with their own
[1:46:56] healing campaigns. That's right.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; Now, when the seals were opened, many
[1:47:02] others rose up with personal
[1:47:05] revelations,
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; drawing people after themselves.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; But the true spirit of Elijah never
[1:47:12] points to a man.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; It always points back to Christ, the
[1:47:17] word.
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; Now, some of you will wonder, maybe
[1:47:22] you're new here tonight, and you wonder,
[1:47:24] well, why why do we need Elijah? Because
[1:47:26] it's like in the book of Judges, every
[1:47:29] man did what was right in his own eyes.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; And without the spirit of Elijah, that's
[1:47:34] exactly where we return back to
[1:47:37] confusion, speculation, and private
[1:47:40] revelation or interpretation.
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; And Peter said, "No prophecy of the
[1:47:45] scripture is of any private
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; interpretation."
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; So why is it that Gentiles must receive
[1:47:53] Elijah? Because like Israel, the gentile
[1:47:57] church in these past seven ages
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; have forsaken the true altar of worship.
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; And they have served even a trinity of
[1:48:07] gods.
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; And the Elijah ministry is to turn the
[1:48:11] hearts of the children back to the faith
[1:48:14] of the apostolic fathers.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; And you see the church was originally
[1:48:19] founded on Jesus Christ. He was the
[1:48:22] chief cornerstone.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; But Paul warned of another Jesus
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; and another gospel.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; And today we see 40,000 denominations,
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; the proof of corruption and splintering.
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; You know, and I just say, which sect out
[1:48:41] there has repented?
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; None of them.
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; Denominations. Those ideas of man are a
[1:48:48] curse and beyond redemption.
[1:48:51] This is why God had to send Elijah not
[1:48:54] to reform but to restore.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; And Elijah today has gathered the
[1:49:00] apostolic truths that was scattered by
[1:49:03] theology. He's rebuilt the altar. It was
[1:49:06] vindicated with a pillar of fire.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; The opening of the seals revealed and
[1:49:11] restored hidden truths. And the
[1:49:14] highlight of his ministry was the sup
[1:49:16] the supernatural supreme token Christ
[1:49:20] life the Holy Ghost applied to the
[1:49:23] believer.
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; And without the token the altar is
[1:49:27] lifeless stones.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; With it the fire falls.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; And if you reject Elijah where's your
[1:49:35] fire?
[1:49:37] Amen.
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; You see, Paul's gospel was not word only
[1:49:41] but
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; but power and demonstration.
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; And a diplomas from a seminary is not
[1:49:48] vindication.
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; Theology taught by religious schools is
[1:49:54] not vindication.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; The fire of God is vindication.
[1:50:05] Are you with me?
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; Without Elijah, you're only left with
[1:50:09] another Jesus,
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; another gospel.
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; With Ana, you know, Anathema, without
[1:50:16] Elijah, we're Rome again.
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; Rect reject Elijah, you're just another
[1:50:22] sect.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; It's your choice.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; It's your choice. Rejection, you're just
[1:50:29] another sect.
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; You're going to be a sect. Well, why
[1:50:31] don't you just join Rome
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; because they're the oldest and
[1:50:35] strongest, just go on back to your
[1:50:37] mother.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; But if you want vindication,
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; you need a God who answers by fire. The
[1:50:45] God of Elijah.
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The spirit of Elijah has
[1:50:54] come. The altar has been revealed. The
[1:50:58] fire is fallen. The token is here for
[1:51:02] without it we are cursed.
[1:51:04] [Applause]
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; But with it
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; we are the manifested sons of God ready
[1:51:12] for a rapture.
[1:51:25] Yet in the pattern of Elijah and Elisha,
[1:51:30] there still is the passing of the
[1:51:33] mantle.
[1:51:38] &gt;&gt; The you see the Bible said, "So he
[1:51:41] departed thence and found Elisha.
[1:51:45] And Elijah passed by him and cast his
[1:51:47] mantel
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; upon him.
[1:51:51] The mantle was the prophet's outer
[1:51:54] garment.
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; It represented the anointing that
[1:51:58] enveloped him, the the authority of his
[1:52:01] commission, the spirit that clothed him
[1:52:03] for his work. When Elisha took up
[1:52:07] Elijah's mantle, he took up his
[1:52:09] assignment, his duties, and his work.
[1:52:12] And what of the bride today she too has
[1:52:15] been called and chosen
[1:52:18] ordained for a specific commission.
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; The mantle of this message is not a
[1:52:26] human spirit.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; It is the Holy Spirit.
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; The very life of Christ resting on the
[1:52:33] bride to fulfill her role
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; in the plan of redemption. And her
[1:52:39] assignment is clear to fulfill every
[1:52:42] word
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; that has been spoken of a bride.
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; She is the final voice
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; to the final age.
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; She is anointed to manifest the
[1:52:53] scriptures that pertain to the bride
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; to live out the very prophecies that
[1:52:58] were written of her before the
[1:53:00] foundation of the world. And just as
[1:53:03] Elisha was under Elijah's anointing, so
[1:53:06] are we. Amen.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; The spirit of Elijah now rest
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; on the bride.
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; And just as Elisha typed the bride, we
[1:53:26] too have been called by name.
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; We have been ordained to this position.
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; We have been summoned and called out of
[1:53:33] the world by God himself. And we've been
[1:53:36] clothed with his mantel.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; Don't we realize as Elisha types the
[1:53:41] bride that we too have been called by
[1:53:43] name. We have been ordained for this
[1:53:46] position.
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; We have been called out by God.
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you Elisha is then he
[1:53:53] doggedly he he follows that prophet.
[1:53:56] Wherever he goes, Elisha goes.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; It's important to follow the messenger
[1:54:01] everywhere he goes.
[1:54:05] Amen. Elisha had to keep his eyes on
[1:54:08] Elijah
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; to receive the double portion.
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; And so must the church follow Jesus
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; to receive the Holy Ghost.
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; You must follow Jesus every day.
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; Or you take on an organizational life.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Elisha had to follow.
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; The Christian walk is a journey.
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can't remain in one place.
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; You can't stand still
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; and still receive the double portion of
[1:54:42] the spirit
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; and truth.
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; You You have to do the same as Elisha.
[1:54:47] You got to keep following. Every
[1:54:49] individual
[1:54:51] comes through the journey just like
[1:54:53] Elisha did. And just as the church has
[1:54:57] advancing from Luther to Wesley to Isuza
[1:55:00] Street to the fullness of the word and
[1:55:02] the spirit, the you see this Elijah
[1:55:06] Elisha narrative is used to typify
[1:55:09] different periods in in church history.
[1:55:11] Brother Brandham used it like this.
[1:55:13] Elisha following Elijah to Gilgal
[1:55:16] represents the church coming out of dark
[1:55:19] ages. Elisha following Elijah to Bethl
[1:55:23] represents the second stage of the
[1:55:24] journey John Wesley's age. You see
[1:55:28] Elisha following Elijah to Jericho
[1:55:31] represents the third state of the
[1:55:33] journey which is the Isuza street
[1:55:36] Pentecostal age and finally Elisha
[1:55:40] crossing the Jordan after re you know
[1:55:43] after receiving a double portion of
[1:55:45] Elijah's spirit represents the next
[1:55:48] stage for the church which is a time of
[1:55:50] the fullness of the word and its
[1:55:53] supernatural power and I want to tell
[1:55:56] you We have now entered into that final
[1:56:00] stage.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; Now, don't we realize that Elisha types
[1:56:04] the bride? We too have been called by
[1:56:07] name.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; We're not here by accident.
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; We have been ordained for this position.
[1:56:14] &gt;&gt; We have been handpicked by God himself.
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "You didn't choose me. I
[1:56:19] chose you. I've ordained you."
[1:56:23] Paul said whom he did forno him he also
[1:56:27] did predestinate moreover whom he
[1:56:30] predestinate he also called
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; you know like Elisha we were out plowing
[1:56:39] in our fields
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; we were busy with the ordinary task of
[1:56:44] life
[1:56:45] &gt;&gt; but when Elijah came by
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; and he cast his mantel over us
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; that mantel was not our choosing.
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; We did not run after it. We did not
[1:56:57] purchase it. We did not deserve it. It
[1:57:00] was a sovereign choice of God.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; He chose you.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; And when that mantel touched Elisha,
[1:57:13] everything changed.
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; He left his oxen and he sacrificed them
[1:57:19] on the fire. He kissed his family
[1:57:21] goodbye. He followed the prophet of God.
[1:57:24] That mantle meant new life. It meant new
[1:57:27] direction. It meant a new destiny.
[1:57:33] &gt;&gt; I was destined for hell. But one day,
[1:57:37] the battle was thrown over me. It turned
[1:57:41] my life around. It changed my direction.
[1:57:50] It gave me a new destiny.
[1:57:53] [Applause]
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; So is it with the bride
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; when God's calling upon us. We could not
[1:58:04] stay in our old fields.
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; We left the world in sin.
[1:58:09] &gt;&gt; We left it all behind. We departed
[1:58:11] man-made religions.
[1:58:13] &gt;&gt; We laid down our own ambitions. We begin
[1:58:16] to follow the word for our day and we're
[1:58:19] not looking back
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; cuz no man having put his hand to the
[1:58:24] plow and looking back is fit for the
[1:58:26] kingdom of God. We're not looking back.
[1:58:33] &gt;&gt; This calling begins a journey following
[1:58:37] Elijah
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; which is following the prophetic word of
[1:58:41] the day. That's right.
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; Elisha couldn't chart his own course.
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; He had to stay with the prophet.
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; Wherever he went
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; through Gilgal, Bethl, Jericho, Jordan,
[1:58:55] he had to follow.
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; So is it with the bride.
[1:58:59] &gt;&gt; We must follow in every stage.
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. Come on.
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; You know, there there's Gilgal, which is
[1:59:05] justification, where we learn that the
[1:59:08] Lord is our provision for sin, therefore
[1:59:10] our righteousness.
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You know, many denominations camp
[1:59:14] there and still live at Gilgal.
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; But those who stay at Gilgal can never
[1:59:22] get the double portion.
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sanctification. Bethl, meaning the
[1:59:27] house of God is where we prepare
[1:59:29] ourselves through sanctification. We're
[1:59:32] cleansed in preparation to becoming the
[1:59:35] dwelling place of God.
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; And there's many of them built their
[1:59:39] denomination.
[1:59:41] at Bethl
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; and they've stayed there.
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; But if you stay at Bethl, you can never
[1:59:52] get the double portion.
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; And then there's the baptism of the Holy
[1:59:57] Ghost, Jericho, at the school of
[2:00:00] prophets, where gifts of the spirit are
[2:00:02] given.
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[2:00:05] &gt;&gt; it's a wonderful place,
[2:00:07] &gt;&gt; but you can't stay in Jericho.
[2:00:11] Because you see, you've got to go across
[2:00:14] Jordan
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; into the fullness of the word where we
[2:00:18] completely die to ourselves.
[2:00:21] Sin nature's dead
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; and we cross Jordan where we rise with
[2:00:25] his life and where we walk in the double
[2:00:28] portion where the book the land is open.
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? Come on.
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; Now, in the sermon of the paradox,
[2:00:37] brother Brandham tells of a vision
[2:00:39] coming down through coming and he saw
[2:00:42] himself coming down on the map of
[2:00:44] Palestine. And he noted he had come
[2:00:47] twothirds of the way to Jordan,
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; And and and he said, "And I looked
[2:00:54] across Jordan and I said, "Oh, praise
[2:00:57] God.
[2:00:58] Just on the other side is where all the
[2:01:01] promises laid.
[2:01:03] Every promise lays in the promised land.
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; Now, at the end of the sermon, he
[2:01:10] explains its meaning and he said, "Now
[2:01:12] you see what coming down to Jordan
[2:01:14] meant. We're down here now. Let us cross
[2:01:17] over. Let's quit playing. Let's cross uh
[2:01:20] the other side now because it all
[2:01:23] belongs to it. It's all ours. Them
[2:01:25] visions never fail. They can't fail
[2:01:27] because they come from God. I believe it
[2:01:30] is all within me. We are not the
[2:01:32] hierland that will run back into the
[2:01:35] wilderness. We will cross Jordan the
[2:01:38] separation. God, break to us the seals
[2:01:42] that's on the back of the book. Let us
[2:01:45] enter into this great place now. For
[2:01:48] Joshua divided to the people their
[2:01:50] inheritance
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; that God had left for them. So crossing
[2:01:56] the Jordan means returning back to the
[2:02:00] land of the Bible.
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; Coming back to its doctrines, is truth
[2:02:07] to the fullness of the spirit.
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; And to do this, the seals must be open.
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; For that opens to us the complete
[2:02:16] inheritance.
[2:02:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; Now, each step requires faithfulness.
[2:02:23] Each test requires determination.
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; But like Elisha the bride cries, "As the
[2:02:31] Lord liveth and my soul liveth, I will
[2:02:34] not leave thee."
[2:02:37] &gt;&gt; We didn't choose this anointing.
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; We were chosen by God. And because he
[2:02:42] chose us,
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; we will follow
[2:02:45] &gt;&gt; through every trial, through every
[2:02:47] stage, through every Jordan. We will not
[2:02:50] turn back.
[2:02:51] For the same God who laid the mantle
[2:02:55] upon us has promised a double portion
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; of his spirit.
[2:03:03] &gt;&gt; Now Elisha followed Elijah. He followed
[2:03:06] with relentless determination.
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; Wherever the prophet went, Ali Elisha
[2:03:11] went because he knew in order to receive
[2:03:15] the double portion, he had to keep his
[2:03:17] eyes on the messenger. In the same way,
[2:03:20] the church must keep our eyes on Jesus,
[2:03:22] the author and the finisher of our
[2:03:24] faith.
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; You see, Elisha's journey was not
[2:03:27] stationary. It was progressive.
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; There's some of you who have remained
[2:03:32] too long in one place.
[2:03:36] [Applause]
[2:03:38] &gt;&gt; God may have brought you to that place.
[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:03:41] &gt;&gt; But he calls you to go further.
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; And every step is a test.
[2:03:49] carry here. I pray thee. It's the test.
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; Well, this was good enough for my
[2:03:56] granddaddy. My granddaddy, my
[2:03:58] grandmother were here. You're going to
[2:04:00] have to realize when the prophet leaves
[2:04:02] Gilgal,
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; you leave Gilgal.
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. God may have brought you to
[2:04:12] forgiveness of sin, but he wants to
[2:04:14] sanctify you of all of those habits in
[2:04:16] your life.
[2:04:21] You got to answer. As the Lord liveth
[2:04:24] and my soul liveth,
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; I will not leave thee.
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; And the church has advanced in stages.
[2:04:33] Now let's talk about the church. Gilgal
[2:04:36] justification through Martin Luther.
[2:04:38] Revelation just shall live by faith.
[2:04:41] Bethl sanctification through John Wesley
[2:04:44] the cleansing of the heart. The call to
[2:04:46] holy living. Jericho,
[2:04:50] &gt;&gt; uh, Pentecost and Isuza Street,
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; where sons of the prophets are
[2:04:57] with a baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:05:00] bringing its anointing, gifts of the
[2:05:02] spirit, and signs following.
[2:05:06] And Jericho is on the edge of Jordan,
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:05:11] &gt;&gt; And there you can speak in genuine
[2:05:13] tongues and still be lost.
[2:05:17] Come on.
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; You can have that baptism every day of
[2:05:24] your life and go to hell.
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; You cannot stay at Jericho.
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; Elijah left Isuza Street behind. And so
[2:05:36] have we.
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; I said so have we.
[2:05:45] We have went across Jordan
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; into the supernatural age.
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; The fullness of the word united with the
[2:05:57] fullness of the spirit and we have
[2:05:59] received the token the literal life of
[2:06:02] Christ producing a bride in his very
[2:06:05] image.
[2:06:08] &gt;&gt; This is the adoption that places you in
[2:06:12] the land.
[2:06:16] It places you in the inheritance.
[2:06:19] &gt;&gt; As brother Bradam said, now we have the
[2:06:22] token in this day. We've been given a
[2:06:24] token which is an antitype of that type
[2:06:27] of that natural token. We have been
[2:06:30] given the supernatural supreme token.
[2:06:34] And all that was for shattered and given
[2:06:36] this generation has been given the
[2:06:39] token. Now we have the Holy Ghost is our
[2:06:42] token and it is our identification
[2:06:46] that we have accepted the death of the
[2:06:49] lamb and not only was Jesus's a human
[2:06:52] life to come back upon us but it was God
[2:06:54] himself manifested in the flesh that
[2:06:58] brought back upon us the adoption of
[2:07:01] sons that now we are the sons and
[2:07:05] daughters of God. That is the token.
[2:07:09] &gt;&gt; It's the identification of our Passover.
[2:07:12] It is our identification. We have
[2:07:15] believed God and God has accepted.
[2:07:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; Now you cannot remain at any stage,
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; justification,
[2:07:26] sanctification,
[2:07:28] even the Pentecostal anointing is not
[2:07:30] the goal. That's right.
[2:07:32] [Music]
[2:07:33] &gt;&gt; With the school of prophets, with his
[2:07:36] prophecies, with his tongues and
[2:07:38] interpretation.
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:41] &gt;&gt; Elisha had to follow Elijah,
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; And go all the way across Jordan.
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; Come on. Where the seals are off the
[2:07:52] book.
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; To receive the double portion.
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:07:57] Now, let me just tell you, in this land
[2:08:00] across Jordan is justification.
[2:08:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; In this land, we're still sanctified.
[2:08:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:08:07] &gt;&gt; In this land, there's still gifts of the
[2:08:10] spirit.
[2:08:11] &gt;&gt; But in this land is more than gifts or
[2:08:14] justification or sanctification. It's
[2:08:17] the fullness of the word. It's the power
[2:08:20] of God.
[2:08:21] Hallelujah. Amen. And we have to follow
[2:08:26] Elijah to proceed the double portion.
[2:08:29] Press into the fullness of Christ that
[2:08:32] you might be filled with all the
[2:08:34] fullness of God.
[2:08:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:39] &gt;&gt; And receive the token. Yes, sir.
[2:08:43] &gt;&gt; Now, let me just stop for a little bit,
[2:08:47] slow down just a second,
[2:08:50] bring out a couple of important points.
[2:08:53] This journey is not a group salvation.
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; It's an individual walk.
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; Elisha was tested at every stop, but he
[2:09:08] refused to let go. And so must we hunger
[2:09:12] and thirst for righteousness and you
[2:09:14] shall be filled. Don't stop at Gilgal
[2:09:16] where you only know forgiveness. And I
[2:09:19] want to say forgiveness is wonderful.
[2:09:22] &gt;&gt; But justification is more.
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; It declares you righteous.
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; Exchanging your sin for Christ's
[2:09:30] righteousness.
[2:09:32] &gt;&gt; If you've been justified by faith, Amen.
[2:09:36] You have exchanged your sins for God's
[2:09:38] righteousness.
[2:09:41] &gt;&gt; But let me don't stop there and don't go
[2:09:44] on to Bethl, but don't stop at Bethl
[2:09:47] where sanctification cleanses you from
[2:09:50] habits and sets you apart.
[2:09:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:09:53] &gt;&gt; Without the new nature of the Holy
[2:09:56] Ghost, you will go back like a dog to
[2:09:59] its vomit
[2:10:01] &gt;&gt; or to a hog to its swallow.
[2:10:03] Sanctification alone will not hold you.
[2:10:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, brother Tim, I I God God
[2:10:11] took pornography from me. I great
[2:10:14] wonderful. He took tobacco. Amen.
[2:10:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:17] &gt;&gt; He I quit drinking. Amen. But don't stop
[2:10:20] there.
[2:10:22] That's right.
[2:10:28] &gt;&gt; And don't stop at Jericho,
[2:10:31] the school of the prophets,
[2:10:34] &gt;&gt; where men ordained themselves
[2:10:36] &gt;&gt; and organizations claim to be the place
[2:10:39] of worship.
[2:10:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:10:41] &gt;&gt; Now, belonging to a fellowship has its
[2:10:43] merits, but God ain't taking groups and
[2:10:46] sects and cults and the rapture. It's an
[2:10:48] individual affair.
[2:10:53] Oh, that's where many people stop and
[2:10:55] make their schools. But let me tell you,
[2:10:57] brother Brandham said is not a group. It
[2:11:01] is a personal vindication of an
[2:11:03] impregnated child of God filled with the
[2:11:06] Holy Ghost. So surrendered to God, he
[2:11:08] don't care anything about anything else.
[2:11:10] And the Holy Spirit living its life,
[2:11:12] pulsating through him, showing the
[2:11:14] personal vindication of the word itself,
[2:11:16] expressing itself to the people and to
[2:11:18] the world.
[2:11:20] Now, I want to I want to just take a
[2:11:22] minute because many preachers will begin
[2:11:26] their ministries in humility.
[2:11:30] &gt;&gt; And like Saul, when thou was little in
[2:11:33] thine own sight,
[2:11:36] &gt;&gt; they walked with God and they were
[2:11:37] teachable. But when power, recognition,
[2:11:42] or following is given, they build a
[2:11:44] throne.
[2:11:46] &gt;&gt; They build a kingdom in their hearts.
[2:11:48] And soon exaltation takes place takes
[2:11:51] the place of humility.
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; And this was the fall of Lucifer from
[2:11:55] the beginning that thine heart was
[2:11:57] lifted up because of thy beauty. Thou
[2:12:00] has corrupted thy wisdom by reason of
[2:12:02] thy brightness.
[2:12:04] &gt;&gt; You see, God gives positions,
[2:12:07] but he doesn't give the Holy Spirit that
[2:12:10] often comes with them.
[2:12:14] Pride is man's corruption,
[2:12:16] &gt;&gt; not God's anointing.
[2:12:18] [Applause]
[2:12:21] &gt;&gt; And Paul warned that. He said, "But the
[2:12:24] time will come when they will not endure
[2:12:26] sound doctrine,
[2:12:27] &gt;&gt; but after their own lust shall heed to
[2:12:30] themselves teaching because they have
[2:12:32] itching ears." Instead of seeking God
[2:12:34] through prayer and leadership of the
[2:12:36] Holy Ghost, then carnal men lean upon
[2:12:40] human leaders.
[2:12:42] And this spirit then exalts ministers
[2:12:45] until they become overlords,
[2:12:48] &gt;&gt; bishops,
[2:12:49] &gt;&gt; and even kings in their own mind.
[2:12:52] &gt;&gt; And their church or their ministry
[2:12:54] becomes the Jerusalem,
[2:12:56] &gt;&gt; the supposed the supposed place for
[2:12:59] worship and for salvation. And in their
[2:13:02] pride, they present themselves as God's
[2:13:06] chosen place of worship.
[2:13:09] But in such system you see the offspring
[2:13:11] of the church is no longer the seed of
[2:13:13] God born of the word of the spirit
[2:13:16] becomes seed of man
[2:13:18] &gt;&gt; human converts to a human system
[2:13:21] &gt;&gt; right
[2:13:22] &gt;&gt; I I I don't want you your disciplehip
[2:13:26] &gt;&gt; I I don't want listen to me I I don't
[2:13:29] want my own offspring
[2:13:32] &gt;&gt; amen I want to present to Christ a chase
[2:13:36] virgin
[2:13:37] That's right.
[2:13:38] &gt;&gt; An undefiled church.
[2:13:41] &gt;&gt; And Paul himself, you know, he carried a
[2:13:43] great authority. But notice his words.
[2:13:46] They glorified God in me. He never drew
[2:13:49] men to himself. He never presented
[2:13:52] himself. And his ministry is the only
[2:13:54] door to salvation.
[2:13:56] &gt;&gt; His commission was to point people to
[2:13:58] Christ alone.
[2:14:00] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes, sir.
[2:14:02] Yet the clergy of every age has sought
[2:14:05] divine leadership plus human control and
[2:14:08] thus given honor where honor is not due.
[2:14:10] They spot the church with humanism and
[2:14:12] they elevate men instead of exalting
[2:14:15] Christ.
[2:14:16] &gt;&gt; And I want to say Jesus,
[2:14:20] not my church,
[2:14:22] not full gospel lighthouse.
[2:14:24] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is God's chosen place of
[2:14:27] worship.
[2:14:31] Not Rome, not Jerusalem, not a
[2:14:34] denomination, not a ministry, not a
[2:14:37] headquarters, not Jeffersonville.
[2:14:40] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "I am the way, the truth,
[2:14:43] and the life, and no man cometh the
[2:14:46] Father but by me."
[2:14:48] &gt;&gt; Salvation is in his name alone. For
[2:14:52] neither is there salvation any other,
[2:14:54] for there is no other name under heaven
[2:14:57] given among men whereby we must be
[2:15:00] saved.
[2:15:06] &gt;&gt; So we must never glory in men but in the
[2:15:09] Lord. God's chosen place of worship is
[2:15:12] not man. It's not a movement. It's not a
[2:15:16] system. is in Jesus himself,
[2:15:19] &gt;&gt; the lamb of God who alone can redeem us
[2:15:21] by his blood.
[2:15:23] &gt;&gt; Now, now notice,
[2:15:27] you see the bride's call. Elisha would
[2:15:30] not leave.
[2:15:33] Wow, you're running out of time.
[2:15:45] Now Elisha would not leave Elijah's
[2:15:48] side.
[2:15:50] Even so the bride will not leave the
[2:15:53] word.
[2:15:56] &gt;&gt; She has a holy determination as the Lord
[2:15:59] liveth.
[2:16:00] &gt;&gt; And my soul liveth,
[2:16:02] &gt;&gt; I will not leave thee.
[2:16:06] &gt;&gt; That's what he's looking for. Thirdbred
[2:16:08] Christians,
[2:16:10] men and women whose nature have been
[2:16:13] changed by the Holy Ghost, who bear the
[2:16:16] life of the lamb, not just the form of
[2:16:19] religion.
[2:16:20] &gt;&gt; The bride has one assignment, that is to
[2:16:23] fulfill every word spoken of her. Now,
[2:16:27] so we must press on, go through every
[2:16:29] stage until the double portion falls.
[2:16:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. So let us fix our eyes on Jesus,
[2:16:34] not turn aside this hunger and thirst.
[2:16:37] Amen. And until we receive more than an
[2:16:41] anointing,
[2:16:42] &gt;&gt; till we're filled with the spirit,
[2:16:44] &gt;&gt; the literal life of Christ.
[2:16:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, but again, as we look at
[2:16:50] this, you see this brings us now to the
[2:16:54] Jericho stage,
[2:16:56] which is spirit without life.
[2:17:00] Here
[2:17:03] are many sons of the prophets at
[2:17:07] Jericho.
[2:17:08] &gt;&gt; Here they gather. It's a type of the
[2:17:10] Pentecostal revival. At Isuza's tree,
[2:17:13] the spirit fell with mighty signs,
[2:17:16] tongues, prophecies, miracles, and many
[2:17:20] stopped there
[2:17:21] &gt;&gt; content with an anointing upon the
[2:17:23] spirit while their soul remained
[2:17:25] unchanged.
[2:17:27] &gt;&gt; Think of it. Men who were alcoholics,
[2:17:31] even drunk in the pullpit, could pray
[2:17:34] for the sick
[2:17:35] &gt;&gt; and get results.
[2:17:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:38] &gt;&gt; Aa Allen was a striking example.
[2:17:40] Anointed use, but bound in personal
[2:17:43] failures. This proves that gifts and
[2:17:46] anointings are no substitute
[2:17:49] &gt;&gt; for token life.
[2:17:51] [Applause]
[2:17:52] &gt;&gt; For gifts and callings are without
[2:17:55] repentance.
[2:17:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:17:58] You can shout,
[2:18:00] &gt;&gt; you can jump,
[2:18:01] &gt;&gt; you can prophesy
[2:18:03] &gt;&gt; and still live a defeated life.
[2:18:07] &gt;&gt; Pentecost brought the church to Jordan's
[2:18:09] edge. But the church must go
[2:18:12] &gt;&gt; across Jordan.
[2:18:14] &gt;&gt; And crossing Jordan means more than
[2:18:17] gifts
[2:18:18] &gt;&gt; and blessings. It means death to self
[2:18:22] and resurrection to life.
[2:18:26] On the outer side of Jordan lays every
[2:18:29] promise of God, the land flowing with
[2:18:32] milk and honey.
[2:18:34] &gt;&gt; But that's not found in the church.
[2:18:38] It's not just f it's not found in church
[2:18:40] excitement and knowledge, but in full
[2:18:43] union with Christ.
[2:18:45] &gt;&gt; And that's where token life begins. the
[2:18:49] literal life of Christ indwelling,
[2:18:52] governing, sealing, empowering the
[2:18:55] believer where you are crucified with
[2:18:58] Christ. Nevertheless, you live.
[2:19:01] &gt;&gt; Because yet it's not I but Christ liveth
[2:19:04] in me.
[2:19:05] &gt;&gt; It's not just an anointing that touches
[2:19:08] and excites your spirit.
[2:19:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. It It's the Holy Ghost coming into
[2:19:14] your soul, abiding forever. Jesus said
[2:19:18] he'll give you another comforter that he
[2:19:20] may abide with you forever.
[2:19:24] [Applause]
[2:19:26] &gt;&gt; So don't stop at Jericho.
[2:19:30] &gt;&gt; Don't settle for gifts without the
[2:19:32] giver.
[2:19:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:19:34] &gt;&gt; Don't rest at the shout
[2:19:36] &gt;&gt; when God's calling you to the token.
[2:19:38] There you go.
[2:19:39] &gt;&gt; Just as Israel had to cross Jordan to
[2:19:42] possess her inheritance, so the bride
[2:19:44] must cross into the full possession of
[2:19:47] the promised word, the Holy Ghost is the
[2:19:49] token, the blood applied, the life of
[2:19:51] Christ himself. And without it, all else
[2:19:54] is incomplete.
[2:19:59] &gt;&gt; We shouldn't be content with fragments,
[2:20:02] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:20:03] &gt;&gt; Or with men having preeminence.
[2:20:06] So let's not stay at Gilgal.
[2:20:08] &gt;&gt; Let's don't stop at Bethl.
[2:20:10] &gt;&gt; Let's don't stop at Jericho, but cross
[2:20:13] into the fullness of the spirit, the
[2:20:16] token life of Jesus Christ and his
[2:20:18] bride. As brother Brandham note the
[2:20:20] title were I think Pentecost failed.
[2:20:23] &gt;&gt; So where did they fail?
[2:20:26] &gt;&gt; And he said oh my the people who claim
[2:20:28] to be filled with the Holy Ghost is
[2:20:29] afraid to trust God for two things.
[2:20:31] brother cross Jordan, get on the other
[2:20:34] side. The portion, double portion of the
[2:20:36] Holy Spirit that was upon Christ was
[2:20:38] sent back to the church to minister and
[2:20:41] carry on the work until he come. Little
[2:20:44] bit while the world seeth me no more,
[2:20:46] and you shall see me, for I will a
[2:20:48] personal pronoun will be with you even
[2:20:50] to the end of the world. He's raised
[2:20:52] from the dead and is with the church
[2:20:54] tonight in spiritual form, giving you
[2:20:57] every bit of the powers he had upon him
[2:21:00] here upon the earth is handed over to
[2:21:02] the church to use and you're afraid to
[2:21:05] use it. I wonder
[2:21:07] &gt;&gt; if you have took that last step. Have
[2:21:11] you really crossed Jordan?
[2:21:15] But let me tell you, I want to assure
[2:21:18] you the token is attainable.
[2:21:24] &gt;&gt; Why in the world would God command us to
[2:21:26] preach the token the Holy Ghost and that
[2:21:29] it's more than a baptism, a dip, a
[2:21:32] portion, but the indwelling life of
[2:21:34] Christ if it was something unattainable?
[2:21:38] &gt;&gt; It is not a dream. It is not a myth.
[2:21:42] It's the promised land for the believer.
[2:21:45] &gt;&gt; That Paul said, "Be filled with the
[2:21:47] spirit."
[2:21:48] &gt;&gt; The token is not something optional. It
[2:21:50] is the ticket for the rapture.
[2:21:53] &gt;&gt; Without it, you ain't going.
[2:21:58] [Applause]
[2:22:00] &gt;&gt; Now, let me just correct a couple of
[2:22:03] things here because many people say,
[2:22:06] "Well, we receive the spirit when we
[2:22:09] believe the message.
[2:22:12] You know, Baptists al often reason that
[2:22:15] way,
[2:22:15] &gt;&gt; but believing isn't receiving.
[2:22:20] &gt;&gt; Even brother Brandham said, "You say, "I
[2:22:21] believe the message, Brother Brandham."
[2:22:23] He said, "That's fine, but you must have
[2:22:24] the token."
[2:22:27] &gt;&gt; Well, I believe you, brother Brandham.
[2:22:29] He said, "That's only being able to
[2:22:30] read."
[2:22:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, so believing is not
[2:22:36] receiving. See, justification is a work
[2:22:39] of the spirit. that declares you
[2:22:40] righteous by faith in Christ.
[2:22:42] Sanctification is a cleansing from the
[2:22:45] works of the flesh. A baptism of the
[2:22:47] spirit is an anointing that brings gifts
[2:22:49] of the spirit. But the token is the Holy
[2:22:52] Ghost himself and is God's own life
[2:22:56] entering to the believer. When Paul
[2:22:59] asked at Ephesus, have you received the
[2:23:02] Holy Ghost since you believed? You see,
[2:23:04] believe brought them sal to salvation,
[2:23:08] but they still needed to receive the
[2:23:10] spirit.
[2:23:11] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:23:13] &gt;&gt; Now, that's where a lot of people stop.
[2:23:15] Well, I I I believe the message. I I I
[2:23:19] see all the mystery truths. I've got it
[2:23:21] all in my altar of worship.
[2:23:24] Now, look at Samaria. In in Acts chapter
[2:23:28] 8, the story of Philip preach preaching
[2:23:31] at at Samaria. There were miracles
[2:23:34] happened. There were demons that fled.
[2:23:36] Healings broke forth. People believed
[2:23:38] the message. They were even baptized in
[2:23:41] the name of the Lord Jesus. Even Simon
[2:23:43] the sorcerer believed and was baptized.
[2:23:47] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:23:48] &gt;&gt; But notice though they had believed and
[2:23:51] were baptized, the Bible said in Acts
[2:23:53] 8:16, "As yet he, the Holy Ghost was
[2:23:57] fallen upon none of them."
[2:24:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:03] You see, only they were baptized in the
[2:24:07] name of the Lord Jesus.
[2:24:10] &gt;&gt; They had believed and even had correct
[2:24:13] water baptism.
[2:24:15] &gt;&gt; And didn't have the Holy Ghost.
[2:24:19] &gt;&gt; Now, even Simon the sorcerer believed.
[2:24:24] &gt;&gt; Simon was baptized. And yet, Peter
[2:24:27] discerned his heart was not right before
[2:24:28] God. He said, "Thy heart is not right in
[2:24:30] the sight of God. Repent. Therefore,
[2:24:33] &gt;&gt; you see this proves belief and water
[2:24:36] baptism alone is not enough.
[2:24:39] &gt;&gt; The token must come.
[2:24:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:24:43] &gt;&gt; But I believe I believe, brother Tim, I
[2:24:45] profess Jesus is the Christ. I I believe
[2:24:48] the message. I I believe it is true.
[2:24:50] I've been baptized. You have to have the
[2:24:52] token.
[2:24:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:24:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, this has been our great
[2:25:00] failure.
[2:25:03] &gt;&gt; Isn't this where most of our much of our
[2:25:07] mission work falls short? Isn't this the
[2:25:10] reason there's so many problems in our
[2:25:13] churches?
[2:25:13] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:25:14] &gt;&gt; Isn't this why that churches
[2:25:19] &gt;&gt; actually become a gather, a cage
[2:25:22] &gt;&gt; of every unclean and hateful bird? Yes
[2:25:26] sir.
[2:25:27] &gt;&gt; Sin setting in message
[2:25:29] &gt;&gt; pews.
[2:25:32] &gt;&gt; Isn't that why we have members in our
[2:25:36] church who think they are saved and are
[2:25:40] still sinners?
[2:25:44] &gt;&gt; We baptize multitudes in water.
[2:25:49] &gt;&gt; But how many truly receive the Holy
[2:25:51] Ghost? Without the token, they remain
[2:25:55] unsealed.
[2:25:57] &gt;&gt; You see, Paul wrote in Ephesians 1:13,
[2:25:59] "After that you believe, you were sealed
[2:26:02] with the Holy Spirit of promise." The
[2:26:04] spirit comes after believing,
[2:26:07] &gt;&gt; not before.
[2:26:09] &gt;&gt; You see, and let me tell you, the call
[2:26:11] is to go the way all the way. The token
[2:26:13] is not
[2:26:16] is not just emotion. It's more than
[2:26:17] emotion.
[2:26:19] It's more It's even more than a baptism
[2:26:22] or anointing coming upon you and you're
[2:26:25] blessed as Isuza had. The token is more
[2:26:28] than a work of the spirit of
[2:26:30] sanctification or justification. It is
[2:26:33] the literal life of Jesus Christ coming
[2:26:37] into you, changing your nature and
[2:26:40] sealing you forever.
[2:26:51] That's why we press beyond Gilgal
[2:26:55] &gt;&gt; justification, beyond Bethl
[2:26:58] sanctification where I cleaned up and
[2:27:00] quit my vices of drugs and alcohol and
[2:27:02] tobacco and I now have a new uniform and
[2:27:05] dress holy and I put off my makeup and
[2:27:07] quit cutting my hair and all of these
[2:27:09] other things.
[2:27:11] It's beyond that.
[2:27:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm glad you came there.
[2:27:16] &gt;&gt; You followed the prophet there.
[2:27:20] &gt;&gt; It's a good place to come,
[2:27:22] &gt;&gt; but don't stay there.
[2:27:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, but brother Chim, I got under the
[2:27:31] anointing and I jumped in the pew and I
[2:27:34] shouted when they sang and I felt the
[2:27:36] spirit and I had chills come running all
[2:27:39] over me. But if your life ain't changed,
[2:27:46] If you save the same old sinner that you
[2:27:50] was when you come in, let me tell you,
[2:27:53] you need the token life.
[2:27:56] &gt;&gt; You need the Holy Ghost. You need to
[2:27:58] cross Jordan. You need to die to that
[2:28:01] old self
[2:28:07] &gt;&gt; and cross over Jordan.
[2:28:10] go into the fullness of token life where
[2:28:14] God dwells in the soul and his nature
[2:28:16] takes over because on the other side of
[2:28:20] Jordan every promise lays
[2:28:24] &gt;&gt; life power and the rapture itself.
[2:28:29] &gt;&gt; So let's don't stop at believing.
[2:28:32] &gt;&gt; Let us don't stop at baptism.
[2:28:35] &gt;&gt; Let's don't stop at the shout and the
[2:28:36] dance.
[2:28:38] Let's press on to the token comes.
[2:28:40] &gt;&gt; Until the spirit has healed us, until
[2:28:43] Christ lives in us. Hallelujah. Till you
[2:28:46] can say, "It ain't me that lives
[2:28:48] anymore. It ain't me that overcomes. It
[2:28:51] ain't me that's trying. It's Christ
[2:28:54] living in me."
[2:29:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:29:03] &gt;&gt; Without the token, we can't go in the
[2:29:05] rapture. But with that with with the
[2:29:08] token, nothing can hold us back. No sin,
[2:29:11] no power of darkness.
[2:29:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. There is no river that
[2:29:18] ain't crossable
[2:29:19] &gt;&gt; with the token.
[2:29:24] [Music]
[2:29:28] &gt;&gt; Now, you know, we're living in the Sodom
[2:29:30] age. The Bible said in Luke 17:30,
[2:29:35] we're in the day when the son of man is
[2:29:37] being revealed. This takes place before
[2:29:41] the burning of Sodom, right in the midst
[2:29:43] of the Sodomite age. You look around us
[2:29:47] and the same
[2:29:49] conditions that marked Sodom marks our
[2:29:52] day.
[2:29:53] &gt;&gt; And this very hour, Jesus said the Son
[2:29:56] of Man would be revealed again.
[2:30:00] Now what is the son of man? Now Jesus
[2:30:04] didn't say the son of god or the son of
[2:30:07] David in this prophecy. He said son of
[2:30:10] man.
[2:30:11] &gt;&gt; Now this is not a different person
[2:30:14] &gt;&gt; but a different ministry.
[2:30:16] &gt;&gt; It is the ministry of Jesus Christ
[2:30:19] himself. It is the word unveiled in the
[2:30:23] last days. When Jesus walked the earth,
[2:30:27] the son of man ministry was the word
[2:30:29] made flesh. He discerned the thoughts,
[2:30:31] the intents of the heart. He healed the
[2:30:33] sick. He opened blind eyes. He
[2:30:35] manifested the very nature of God in
[2:30:38] human flesh.
[2:30:39] &gt;&gt; But the son of man ministry is more than
[2:30:42] signs and wonders. Right?
[2:30:45] &gt;&gt; It is the very life of and nature of
[2:30:48] Christ returning to a bride people
[2:30:51] uniting her with the word until she and
[2:30:55] he are one.
[2:30:58] &gt;&gt; Now that's what this tok Holy Ghost
[2:31:01] token is truly for. Is is not an
[2:31:05] anointing that comes and goes.
[2:31:09] is not merely a gift,
[2:31:12] &gt;&gt; but it's the life of Jesus Christ
[2:31:16] &gt;&gt; indwelling his bride,
[2:31:18] &gt;&gt; Christ in you, the hope of glory.
[2:31:22] &gt;&gt; Now, let me just tell you the difference
[2:31:24] of it. You see, you know, you'll get
[2:31:27] blessed in church and you'll feel the
[2:31:29] power of God. That's the anointing.
[2:31:31] That's right.
[2:31:33] &gt;&gt; But when you walk out of here,
[2:31:35] &gt;&gt; that leaves.
[2:31:37] &gt;&gt; Maybe tomorrow it's gone.
[2:31:40] &gt;&gt; Maybe trouble comes, it's all gone. That
[2:31:43] becomes a memory.
[2:31:44] &gt;&gt; But let me tell you something. The token
[2:31:47] is not a baptism.
[2:31:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:31:50] &gt;&gt; The token is indwelling life.
[2:31:53] &gt;&gt; And when you leave from here, the token
[2:31:55] goes with you.
[2:31:56] &gt;&gt; And when you're in bad times, the token
[2:31:58] is there. And when you're presented with
[2:32:00] sin, the token is there to overcome.
[2:32:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's the life of Christ in
[2:32:06] you. It never leaves you.
[2:32:11] &gt;&gt; The anointing comes and goes,
[2:32:15] &gt;&gt; but the spirit of the token abides with
[2:32:18] you forever.
[2:32:21] [Applause]
[2:32:25] And the son of man ministry in this hour
[2:32:28] is Christ expressing himself again not
[2:32:32] in one individual body of flesh but in
[2:32:34] his bride body around the world. The
[2:32:36] word has returned in his fullness and
[2:32:39] the bride receives that word until she
[2:32:41] becomes its living manifestation.
[2:32:44] Now this is the age of Luke 17:30. The
[2:32:48] son of man's revealed. It's not just
[2:32:50] miracles. is not just discernment, but
[2:32:52] it's the very nature of Christ returned
[2:32:56] to anoint his bride, making her bone of
[2:32:59] his bone and flesh of his flesh. This is
[2:33:03] the token life. The bride united with
[2:33:06] the bridegroom, the word and the spirit
[2:33:07] made flesh again. Now, brother brother
[2:33:11] Brandham said, you know, that that that
[2:33:14] you know, and and there's a there's a
[2:33:16] lot of quotes that I could read right
[2:33:18] here, but let me just tell you. He said,
[2:33:20] he said, I challenge you to believe that
[2:33:23] Jesus Christ is revealed in the form of
[2:33:26] the son of man in human flesh through
[2:33:30] the bride's body. Right.
[2:33:33] &gt;&gt; So this is where the son of man
[2:33:36] &gt;&gt; the ministry and life of Christ
[2:33:38] &gt;&gt; is on display
[2:33:40] &gt;&gt; and is living in a people.
[2:33:42] &gt;&gt; It is Christ revealed in the form of son
[2:33:46] of man
[2:33:48] &gt;&gt; through the bride's body.
[2:33:50] &gt;&gt; Listen as brother Brandon said in spoken
[2:33:52] words original seed as these end time
[2:33:55] prophecies will repeat. I believe as the
[2:33:58] first forerunner came from the
[2:34:00] wilderness and cried, "Behold the lamb
[2:34:02] of God, the second forerunner will
[2:34:04] probably do the same by pointing the
[2:34:06] people to a wordborn bride."
[2:34:10] &gt;&gt; He says again, now watch now and this is
[2:34:13] God's provided place of worship. 1965
[2:34:16] the bride the church will come through
[2:34:18] justification through Luther through
[2:34:20] sanctification through Wesley through
[2:34:22] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the
[2:34:24] Pentecost and go right on into the
[2:34:27] perfection of the son of man that when
[2:34:31] husband and wife will be the same
[2:34:34] selfersons.
[2:34:36] God will be so manifested into his bride
[2:34:39] in his church till they will both be the
[2:34:42] same. They are one. Now you see where
[2:34:46] we're at.
[2:34:48] &gt;&gt; We're right here in the perfection of
[2:34:52] the son of man.
[2:34:54] &gt;&gt; The life of Christ on display in a
[2:34:58] bride.
[2:35:00] &gt;&gt; The token his literal life
[2:35:05] &gt;&gt; on display.
[2:35:06] &gt;&gt; That's right. Now, so you see we we have
[2:35:10] come now right now to to to through
[2:35:13] through all these things. We've come
[2:35:14] justification to Martin Luther,
[2:35:17] sanctification through John Wesley,
[2:35:19] baptism of the Holy Ghost through
[2:35:21] Pentecost, restoring of gifts. But it
[2:35:23] didn't stop there. The church must move
[2:35:26] on into perfection. The perfection of
[2:35:29] the son of man. What does it mean? It is
[2:35:33] not only the continuation of Christ's
[2:35:36] ministry, but it's completion in a
[2:35:40] bride.
[2:35:41] &gt;&gt; What he started
[2:35:43] in groom form, he's going to finish
[2:35:47] &gt;&gt; in bride form.
[2:35:49] &gt;&gt; What was manifested in the groom, Jesus
[2:35:52] Christ, must be manifested in his bride.
[2:35:55] That's right.
[2:35:58] &gt;&gt; So he said at that day you shall know
[2:36:00] that I'm in the father and you and me
[2:36:01] and I in you. We are members of his body
[2:36:04] of his flesh and of his bones. That's
[2:36:06] what Paul said. The husband and wife
[2:36:08] becomes one person. The same life, same
[2:36:11] nature, same word expressed.
[2:36:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you with me?
[2:36:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. The son of man is the ministry of
[2:36:17] Christ revealed at the end time in his
[2:36:20] first body, the groom. He discerned the
[2:36:22] thoughts. He healed the sick. He
[2:36:24] revealed the word. But now in his bride
[2:36:27] body, the same ministry comes to
[2:36:30] perfection.
[2:36:31] &gt;&gt; Not in one man alone, but in a
[2:36:34] multi-membered body
[2:36:36] &gt;&gt; across the earth.
[2:36:38] &gt;&gt; And this marries or unites the bride and
[2:36:42] Christ together. It makes the bride in
[2:36:45] union with Christ.
[2:36:50] &gt;&gt; And this is not a doctrine. It's a
[2:36:52] mystery union. The bride is not separate
[2:36:55] from him. She is him. She's bone of his
[2:36:58] bone. She's flesh of his flesh. What the
[2:37:01] groom did in his earthly ministry, the
[2:37:03] bride will do in the end time ministry.
[2:37:06] The works that I do shall you do also.
[2:37:08] Amen. Till we all come to the unity of
[2:37:11] the faith of the perfect man, to the
[2:37:13] measure of the stature of the fullness
[2:37:15] of Christ.
[2:37:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:37:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is where we stand now. right
[2:37:19] at the threshold of the bride and the
[2:37:21] bridegroom being manifested as the same
[2:37:24] self person. Christ in his church
[2:37:27] finishing what he began and preparing a
[2:37:29] bride for the rapture.
[2:37:32] &gt;&gt; So you see we're not just Luther or
[2:37:34] Wesley or Isuz of Pentecost but the son
[2:37:37] of man revealed Christ revealed in his
[2:37:42] perfection.
[2:37:43] &gt;&gt; The bride and the groom are one. the
[2:37:45] life, the word, the same spirit. You
[2:37:48] see, it's the hour of union. It is now,
[2:37:52] you know, is now where he expresses
[2:37:55] himself in his godhead deity through his
[2:37:58] church. Have preeminence in this church.
[2:38:00] The anointed man now the anointed
[2:38:04] people.
[2:38:05] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about you.
[2:38:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:38:07] &gt;&gt; Oh my. To bring back the anointed bride
[2:38:10] and bridegroom. You see, it's the life
[2:38:13] of Jesus that must be in you.
[2:38:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. It is him. It's him working in
[2:38:20] your life.
[2:38:21] &gt;&gt; Now, this is the bride coming of Christ.
[2:38:26] &gt;&gt; Elijah is gone.
[2:38:29] &gt;&gt; But the spirit of Elijah is still
[2:38:33] anointing Elisha. Amen.
[2:38:36] &gt;&gt; Not his human spirit
[2:38:38] &gt;&gt; but the spirit of Christ that was
[2:38:40] associated with Elijah. Remember this
[2:38:42] Elijah and Elisha always is a type of
[2:38:44] Christ the church with a double portion.
[2:38:47] Now let let me just you know go through
[2:38:50] what is the double portion brother. I
[2:38:53] went through it every time where brother
[2:38:55] Brandon mentioned and I just made a
[2:38:57] whole list of them. And the double
[2:38:59] portion is the same baptism Jesus had.
[2:39:04] The double portion is Mark 16. These
[2:39:06] signs have shall follow them that
[2:39:07] believe.
[2:39:08] &gt;&gt; The double portion is John 14:12. The
[2:39:11] things that I do, so you do also, and
[2:39:14] greater
[2:39:15] &gt;&gt; double portion, more of it. Double
[2:39:17] portion. The greater works is the third
[2:39:20] pull, the spoken word.
[2:39:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Double portion. Former and latter
[2:39:26] reign.
[2:39:28] &gt;&gt; The double portion is the spiritual
[2:39:31] resurrection. where we cross Jordan.
[2:39:35] That's the earnest one portion. And then
[2:39:38] the physical resurrection where the
[2:39:41] saints cross back over Jordan
[2:39:44] representing the change of our bodies.
[2:39:47] &gt;&gt; So I want you to see the double portion.
[2:39:50] If you get one portion, you're going to
[2:39:52] get the other portion. If you cross
[2:39:55] Jordan, come on.
[2:39:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. and you were born again filled
[2:39:59] with the token, you're going to come up
[2:40:00] with resurrection power.
[2:40:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. The resurrection and body change
[2:40:07] lies in the double portion. Don't you
[2:40:10] want it?
[2:40:12] &gt;&gt; Well, with the token, the genuine Holy
[2:40:15] Ghost, you have the guarantee of the
[2:40:18] body change. It is the earnest
[2:40:22] of the inheritance that if you got this
[2:40:26] portion, you will get the other portion.
[2:40:29] &gt;&gt; If you got the token, you're also going
[2:40:32] to be resurrected. Your bodies are going
[2:40:35] to be changed. You'll be among those
[2:40:37] alive and remain at the coming of the
[2:40:39] Lord.
[2:40:46] &gt;&gt; Elijah said,
[2:40:50] You asked for a hard thing.
[2:40:53] You asked for a double portion.
[2:40:56] Now, not because it was hard for God.
[2:41:00] Not because it was hard for Elijah.
[2:41:03] The difficulty was for Elisha.
[2:41:06] Because to receive the double portion
[2:41:08] means he will now bear the
[2:41:11] responsibility of the mantle.
[2:41:14] He will be the one commissioned to carry
[2:41:17] forward the work.
[2:41:19] &gt;&gt; So you see there there has to be and and
[2:41:22] and Elijah said, "Well, I'll tell you
[2:41:24] what. If you see me
[2:41:28] when I'm taken from thee, it shall be
[2:41:32] given to you."
[2:41:34] &gt;&gt; But here's the prerequisite to get the
[2:41:36] double portion. You got to see me.
[2:41:41] If thou see me when I'm taken from thee,
[2:41:43] it shall be so to thee. So Elisha had to
[2:41:46] watch with unwavering focus.
[2:41:50] &gt;&gt; And when the chariot of fire carried
[2:41:52] Elijah away, Elisha cried, "My father,
[2:41:56] my father, the chariot of Israel, and
[2:41:57] the horsemen thereof, and the prophet
[2:42:00] was gone,
[2:42:02] but the spirit remained."
[2:42:07] So Elisha picked up the fallen mantel.
[2:42:10] He smoked the waters of Jordan. He
[2:42:12] cried, "Where is the God of Elijah?"
[2:42:15] &gt;&gt; And the waters parted, proving that the
[2:42:18] same God was still present, still
[2:42:20] working, still anointed.
[2:42:28] &gt;&gt; Now, let me bring it home. The parallel
[2:42:30] for us. Yeah. Elijah was taken away, but
[2:42:34] the spirit is still here.
[2:42:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, Jesus ascended into heaven, but he
[2:42:40] said, "I will not leave you comfortless.
[2:42:42] I will come to you." His spirit is still
[2:42:45] here.
[2:42:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, the apostles died 2,000 years ago,
[2:42:50] but the same Holy Ghost still anoints
[2:42:53] the bride.
[2:42:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah, brother Brandham was taken from
[2:42:57] us, but the God of Elijah is still here.
[2:43:01] still moving and still commissioning a
[2:43:04] people.
[2:43:07] &gt;&gt; This is the hour of Elisha and the
[2:43:11] double portion.
[2:43:16] &gt;&gt; But you will never get to the double
[2:43:19] portion
[2:43:21] unless you see him taken away.
[2:43:26] It literally means
[2:43:29] if you perceive me when I'm removed from
[2:43:31] being with you
[2:43:34] that that Elisha must accept Elijah's
[2:43:38] departure.
[2:43:40] Now just see it with his physical eyes
[2:43:42] but see him as gone from him. In other
[2:43:47] words, if Elisha clung to Elijah,
[2:43:50] wishing him to remain, he would miss the
[2:43:53] transition.
[2:43:56] &gt;&gt; But if he perceived and he accepted that
[2:43:59] Elijah was truly taken away, then he was
[2:44:02] ready to step into his own calling.
[2:44:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, if we have seen Elijah,
[2:44:11] then it's the hour for an Elisha people
[2:44:14] to arise.
[2:44:16] those who pick up the mantel and step
[2:44:19] into their commission.
[2:44:23] &gt;&gt; And this is not the hour to mourn for
[2:44:26] what has been taken.
[2:44:28] &gt;&gt; Or to chase after what God has already
[2:44:31] finished.
[2:44:35] &gt;&gt; I want to say this. How many searches
[2:44:38] has there been for Elijah?
[2:44:42] &gt;&gt; Go ahead.
[2:44:44] &gt;&gt; Perhaps he will come here. Maybe he'll
[2:44:46] come there,
[2:44:48] &gt;&gt; you know. Maybe he'll need this
[2:44:49] airplane. Maybe we'll need a tent. Maybe
[2:44:52] we'll need a bunch of trucks. Maybe
[2:44:54] we'll do this.
[2:44:56] &gt;&gt; You know, there's been so much
[2:44:57] speculation looking for his return.
[2:45:00] &gt;&gt; Surely the spirit of the Lord cast him
[2:45:02] down somewhere.
[2:45:04] &gt;&gt; Come on. But after 60 years,
[2:45:08] &gt;&gt; many of them that sent men out on a
[2:45:10] search for Elijah even themselves are
[2:45:12] dead and gone.
[2:45:14] &gt;&gt; And still Elijah hasn't returned.
[2:45:18] &gt;&gt; Who sent out those searches?
[2:45:20] &gt;&gt; The school of the prophets.
[2:45:23] &gt;&gt; But I'm going to tell you, this is not
[2:45:25] the hour to mourn
[2:45:27] &gt;&gt; of what was taken away or to chase after
[2:45:30] what God has finished. This is the hour
[2:45:33] to smite the waters of impossibility and
[2:45:37] declare where is the God of Elijah.
[2:45:43] &gt;&gt; Somebody somebody must carry the double
[2:45:47] portion.
[2:45:49] &gt;&gt; Somebody got to rise in the power of the
[2:45:52] Holy Ghost with the revelation of that
[2:45:54] word. And that someone is you, the bride
[2:45:58] of Jesus Christ right here in this last
[2:46:00] age.
[2:46:02] And this is our commission. Take the
[2:46:05] mantel that has fallen to us.
[2:46:08] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[2:46:08] &gt;&gt; Walk in that anointing.
[2:46:10] &gt;&gt; Manifest the same ministry.
[2:46:13] &gt;&gt; Not in one man but in a multimember
[2:46:16] body.
[2:46:17] &gt;&gt; The spirit of Elijah has come. And now
[2:46:20] an Elisha bride.
[2:46:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Must arise with a double portion
[2:46:26] &gt;&gt; and finish the work.
[2:46:29] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[2:46:33] You've asked for a hard thing.
[2:46:36] &gt;&gt; Well, if you want the token, the Holy
[2:46:39] Ghost indwell, you're going to have to
[2:46:41] keep your eyes on Jesus.
[2:46:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:46:44] &gt;&gt; As he moves, you move.
[2:46:47] &gt;&gt; As he moves you from justification to a
[2:46:49] sanctified life, follow him.
[2:46:52] &gt;&gt; Don't let him get out of sight.
[2:46:54] &gt;&gt; When he moves and you get a little jump
[2:46:56] or a shout, I say keep following him.
[2:47:00] Amen. Follow him until he sends his
[2:47:04] cloak, his mantle. The same spirit that
[2:47:07] covered Jesus,
[2:47:08] &gt;&gt; covers you. Whatever you do, get that
[2:47:11] token.
[2:47:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:47:17] I can get some people get, oh, they're
[2:47:20] mad now.
[2:47:22] You know, they're indignant. You have no
[2:47:24] right
[2:47:26] to the mantel of Elijah. That was only
[2:47:29] for brother Brandham. Listen, I ain't
[2:47:31] talking about trying to be the seventh
[2:47:33] angel.
[2:47:35] &gt;&gt; I ain't talking about having his gift.
[2:47:38] &gt;&gt; His gift was not one of the nine spirits
[2:47:40] gifts of the spirit. It was no mere word
[2:47:43] of knowledge. It was the ministry of
[2:47:45] Jesus Christ again displayed in power to
[2:47:48] vindicate the word.
[2:47:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:47:50] &gt;&gt; But let me tell you, let's just change
[2:47:53] the focus. Just as Elijah was caught up
[2:47:56] in a whirlwind and his mantle fell to
[2:47:59] Elisha,
[2:48:01] when Jesus
[2:48:02] &gt;&gt; when he ascended to heaven,
[2:48:04] &gt;&gt; he sent back his own mantle.
[2:48:09] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost
[2:48:11] &gt;&gt; and the very spirit that clothed,
[2:48:13] empowered, and indwelled Jesus Christ
[2:48:16] has now wrapped his bride, a rapture
[2:48:21] inside and out.
[2:48:26] It'll wrap the body. It'll make you
[2:48:29] shout. It'll make you dance. It will
[2:48:32] anoint the spirit of the man. It'll give
[2:48:34] you a new spirit. It'll change your
[2:48:36] attitude. But it must come and dwell on
[2:48:40] the inside of you.
[2:48:46] &gt;&gt; It must abide with you forever. It must
[2:48:49] seal you to the day of redemption.
[2:48:55] Hallelujah.
[2:48:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It'll make you like the
[2:48:58] disciples who were unsure and afraid and
[2:49:01] they went to the upper room and they
[2:49:03] waited and on the day of Pentecost he
[2:49:05] sent it down. The same spirit that was
[2:49:08] upon Jesus came back upon the church
[2:49:11] like and it descended upon them like a
[2:49:14] fire, like a robe. It was his mantle
[2:49:17] falling on the church.
[2:49:22] &gt;&gt; And it wasn't just a symbol. It was
[2:49:23] power.
[2:49:24] &gt;&gt; It was a baptism of the Holy Ghost. It
[2:49:27] was the divine covering of the
[2:49:28] authority. It was the anointing that
[2:49:31] turned ordinary men into vessels of the
[2:49:34] miraculous.
[2:49:38] &gt;&gt; And Elisha received a double portion.
[2:49:42] Not a copy,
[2:49:43] &gt;&gt; not something lesser,
[2:49:45] &gt;&gt; but a multiplied measure of the same
[2:49:47] spirit.
[2:49:50] &gt;&gt; And Elisha walked in that anointing. He
[2:49:52] did the works. He parted the waters. He
[2:49:56] continued the ministry of his
[2:49:58] predecessor.
[2:49:59] but even in a greater measure. And Jesus
[2:50:02] said we would do it. The works that I do
[2:50:07] shall you do also,
[2:50:09] &gt;&gt; and a dumb portion, and greater than
[2:50:12] these
[2:50:13] &gt;&gt; shall you do.
[2:50:16] &gt;&gt; Now, as we look at it for a moment,
[2:50:21] we ought to be determined tonight. God,
[2:50:24] whatever. I want that. I want that
[2:50:27] mantle.
[2:50:29] Amen. I want that mantle. You know,
[2:50:32] death has got to be bound. And we're
[2:50:34] here crossing Jordan. We got to be more
[2:50:37] sincere to get that double portion.
[2:50:40] Notice and Elisha is standing at the
[2:50:42] river and he's facing a difficult
[2:50:45] situation. School of the prophets are wa
[2:50:48] watching. The scoffers are there
[2:50:51] ridiculing. They're wondering. They're
[2:50:54] doubting that God is with the bride as
[2:50:57] he was with Elijah. Do we really have
[2:51:00] true worship? Or is it just the message
[2:51:03] with a dead form and no power?
[2:51:06] &gt;&gt; Little children mocking Elisha.
[2:51:09] Mocking the bride. Go up in the rapture
[2:51:11] like Elisha.
[2:51:13] &gt;&gt; There's never going to be a rapture. Go
[2:51:14] up, you baldhead. And they fell under a
[2:51:17] curse.
[2:51:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. And bears ate them up. And I tell
[2:51:21] you, the mockers today will be left
[2:51:23] behind and the Russian bear
[2:51:25] &gt;&gt; with his bomb is going to destroy them.
[2:51:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. But when you receive the mantle,
[2:51:31] there is no obstacle. There's nothing
[2:51:34] can hinder you. No Jordan, no serpent of
[2:51:37] death, nothing can stand before you.
[2:51:40] Amen. You believe for the impossible.
[2:51:42] You do the work of Christ. You are
[2:51:45] Messiah. You are literally anointed one.
[2:51:48] You're walking, talking, spiritled
[2:51:50] expressions of the word.
[2:51:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:51:55] &gt;&gt; He said, "Where is the God of Elijah?"
[2:51:59] We ask today, "Where is the God of
[2:52:02] Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob? Where is the
[2:52:05] God of Jesus Christ? Where is the God of
[2:52:08] Elijah? Where's the God of William
[2:52:09] Brandom?" Here's the answer. He's
[2:52:12] revealed in his sons
[2:52:15] &gt;&gt; and his daughters. who worship him in
[2:52:19] spirit and in truth.
[2:52:22] &gt;&gt; This is the hour of adoption. This the
[2:52:24] hour when full grown sons walk in their
[2:52:28] inheritance and they speak and their
[2:52:30] words are back.
[2:52:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is the earnest
[2:52:34] expectation of the creature that has
[2:52:36] been waiting for the revealing of the
[2:52:38] sons of God.
[2:52:40] &gt;&gt; This is the time, the fullness of the
[2:52:42] ages. This is where we're at. Oh my, we
[2:52:46] here at the fullness of time where full
[2:52:49] sons walk out and take every power that
[2:52:51] Satan has away from him.
[2:52:53] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:52:55] &gt;&gt; Then if you are, then you ought to rise
[2:52:57] up and take that anointing.
[2:53:00] &gt;&gt; We're not waiting on it.
[2:53:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:53:03] &gt;&gt; It's already here.
[2:53:06] &gt;&gt; We've seen it work.
[2:53:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. All of you know about Sister
[2:53:11] Atlanta. She had four stage four hotkins
[2:53:14] li lymphoma and the doctors feared the
[2:53:17] chemo would kill her. She took that
[2:53:19] mantle and that ano and that with that
[2:53:22] anointing and struck her Jordan and
[2:53:25] crossed right back into health again.
[2:53:28] You all have heard this the testimony of
[2:53:30] Mariah with an autoimmune immune disease
[2:53:34] alipcia that had robbed her of her glory
[2:53:38] and the doctor said it was incurable.
[2:53:41] But that and that the river was
[2:53:43] uncrushable. But she struck that river
[2:53:47] and she crossed on dry ground and got
[2:53:51] her glory back.
[2:53:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right there's my daughter Lydia.
[2:53:56] had a baby boy Jude with a kidney
[2:53:59] disease and sitting in a service with
[2:54:01] her child and grabbed that mantle and
[2:54:04] ran to the altar and the prayer of faith
[2:54:06] was prayed and God put new kidneys in
[2:54:09] that baby's body.
[2:54:15] There's Kimberly W who stood in an
[2:54:18] uncrossable river. Her brother out in
[2:54:20] sin came through a prayer line. You were
[2:54:22] there brother Wayne. You prayed with her
[2:54:25] asking for her brother's salvation and
[2:54:27] by faith took her mantle and struck the
[2:54:30] river of impossibility.
[2:54:33] &gt;&gt; And while we were still conducting the
[2:54:36] prayer line, her brother Justin walks in
[2:54:39] with his pajamas on. Amen. And God
[2:54:43] gloriously saved him, saves his life and
[2:54:46] he's still saved.
[2:54:51] &gt;&gt; Have you got any river that you think
[2:54:54] are impossible?
[2:54:56] Have you got any mountain you can't
[2:54:59] tuddle through?
[2:55:05] &gt;&gt; Here the other day, a young man, Jason
[2:55:08] Tiger, walked into our church there. He
[2:55:10] He was there in bit of drugs and alcohol
[2:55:13] tatted up all from head to toe. He's
[2:55:15] listening in right now. And while he was
[2:55:18] sitting there in church, while the word
[2:55:21] went forth without any hands laid on
[2:55:24] him, he took the mana fell on him, he
[2:55:27] struck the river.
[2:55:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:55:30] &gt;&gt; Drugs behind him, alcohol behind him,
[2:55:33] sinful life behind him, changed forever
[2:55:37] and still serving God.
[2:55:41] Hallelujah. Amen. What about baby Drew
[2:55:45] when he was there undeveloped hip and
[2:55:48] unable to walk or stand seen in a vision
[2:55:50] walking across the river and one day as
[2:55:53] a 18-month-old boy baby boy unable to
[2:55:57] stand or walk. The man swept over him.
[2:55:59] He got over got up and crossed the
[2:56:01] river. Ran around the house. He didn't
[2:56:04] walk his first steps. He ran his first
[2:56:07] steps.
[2:56:11] Time would fail us to talk to those who
[2:56:13] were alcoholics, nicotine, and drug
[2:56:16] addicts and sexually immoral who have
[2:56:19] crossed the river.
[2:56:21] &gt;&gt; And you have your own testimonies.
[2:56:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:56:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. What about Ron Spencer
[2:56:28] &gt;&gt; through the fire
[2:56:30] &gt;&gt; when he was about to harvest his organs
[2:56:33] standing at an uncrushable river, but we
[2:56:36] took the mantel and struck the river?
[2:56:39] &gt;&gt; He's living today.
[2:56:44] What about that day five years ago when
[2:56:47] I came here with Donnie Reagan and we
[2:56:49] prayed with him and the spirit of fear
[2:56:51] left him? about that cancer when the
[2:56:54] doctor had given him only four months to
[2:56:56] live and he's still living 5 years
[2:56:59] later.

[2:57:04] impossible? I tell you, you want to know
[2:57:06] whereins of God of Elijah? He's right

[2:57:13] heal. He's here to deliver. He's here to
[2:57:15] fill with token life.
[2:57:23] What about when cancer made him so weak
[2:57:26] and he stood there and he stood here and
[2:57:28] preached I must get to Jesus. He said in
[2:57:31] brother Brandon's meeting they'd drive
[2:57:33] 17 hours to get to Jesus. Where is
[2:57:36] Jesus? Said brother Tim 17 hours away.

[2:58:25] would think was uncrossable.
[2:58:29] &gt;&gt; But we preached the hour has come and we

[3:58:13] strength and the message that we need to
[3:58:14] hear, Father, in the morning, Lord.
[3:58:18] Lord Jesus, this is the greatest place
[3:58:20] that we could be on the face of the

[3:59:21] passes understanding now. Give them a
[3:59:24] good night's rest, Lord. And we praise
[3:59:26] you so much for your goodness, Lord.
