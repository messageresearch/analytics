[2:12] the
[2:12] but brother Matt and brother Andrew and
[2:15] their wives and families and brother
[2:16] Davey and them just make us so welcome
[2:19] and we certainly appreciate that and I'm
[2:21] privileged this trip to have my wife
[2:23] with me sister joy and my youngest
[2:26] daughter sister Caitlyn she's 17 years
[2:29] old first time she's ever been here I'm
[2:31] kind of ashamed of that but we're good
[2:34] good I'm glad she was able to come with
[2:36] us this time
[2:39] just pray tonight that something would
[2:41] be said that would change your life I
[2:45] had something happen and I don't maybe
[2:48] you could just be seated for a moment I
[2:50] don't want to keep you standing but I
[2:53] had something happen a couple of days
[2:54] ago well it's been about a week or so
[2:56] ago now a week and a half it was
[2:59] actually on Wednesday and brother Ralph
[3:02] had passed on Tuesday and I didn't know
[3:04] it at the time and on Wednesday I was
[3:07] sitting in my office and I could look
[3:11] out over a little lake there in front of
[3:13] the house and right out of my window and
[3:15] as I looked out I'd turned on the tape
[3:17] as the Eagle stirs her nest and as I
[3:21] looked out and I looked across the pond
[3:23] there's sort of great big eagle right in
[3:26] the top of a tree and I snapped the
[3:28] picture of it and I sent it to Andrew I
[3:30] said you got to look at this this is
[3:32] something and and and then he tells me
[3:34] Saturday that as they was putting the
[3:37] body of our brother in the Hurst he was
[3:39] relating the story I think to his sister
[3:41] here or somewhere and it was telling her
[3:43] what had happened and a great bald eagle
[3:46] just flew over the top of the church and
[3:48] began the circle now I don't believe God
[3:50] does things by chance or by just the
[3:53] coincidence there there's something
[3:55] supernatural and then brother John
[3:59] Tandy's sent a message and said Saturday
[4:02] they had had a funeral there was four
[4:03] eagles circling over top of the cemetery
[4:08] well I just believe it's a stirring time
[4:11] it's wraps our time it's time for us to
[4:14] be prepared to go home and and I believe
[4:17] we're living in that hour to where we
[4:20] will see the miraculous
[4:22] brother on kept saying before I come out
[4:25] we're living in that and that time of
[4:27] revival well that's what I'm speaking on
[4:31] the night and little did he know my
[4:32] title but I want to speak to you tonight
[4:35] on the bride's revival but if you'd like
[4:39] to stand just for a moment as we read
[4:41] the word I want to turn to Matthew
[4:47] chapter 24 and verse 28 and then also
[4:51] into mark chapter 16 Matthew 24 and 28
[5:00] for wheresoever the carcass is there the
[5:12] Eagles will be gathered together mark
[5:19] chapter 16 verse 17
[5:30] these signs shall follow them that
[5:32] believe how many believers in my name
[5:36] they shall cast out Devils they shall
[5:38] speak with new tongues they shall take
[5:41] up serpents and if they drink any deadly
[5:43] thing it shall not hurt them and they
[5:46] shall lay hands on the sick and they
[5:49] might recover you might find Anna's
[5:53] brother Ryan will put you might find
[5:54] that none Almanac or something you're
[5:56] not gonna find that in the Bible for the
[5:58] Bible says and they shall recover
[6:02] may the Lord that is blessing this
[6:04] evening you may be seated
[6:05] I want to read you just a little a
[6:11] sentence out of God's provided way
[6:13] brother and said where God is moving
[6:15] people come the worse of God it's always
[6:19] been so it's always been that way where
[6:23] God is moving people come to Orson but
[6:26] now we know that in the scriptures and
[6:28] in the and the prophet of God is the
[6:30] message he brought us we are called in
[6:32] the world
[6:33] Eagles huh but an eagle had to start out
[6:37] as a baby before it ever mattered you
[6:39] didn't start out flying just as soon as
[6:42] you was born an eagle you had to go
[6:44] through a process that you might mature
[6:46] until you come into that that the Eagle
[6:50] that could actually fly and when the
[6:53] mother Eagles I noticed his brother
[6:55] madam was preaching the message of as
[6:56] the Eagle stirs from nest I got to
[6:58] paying close attention when a mother
[7:01] builds a nest she builds it in a
[7:05] specific special certain way she starts
[7:09] with thorns and briars and thistles and
[7:11] twigs and and limbs and whatever she can
[7:14] find and then she wraps it in fur that's
[7:20] the first thing that has to come out of
[7:22] the nest it's the last thing that goes
[7:24] in the nest but it's the first thing
[7:27] that comes out of the nest
[7:28] and you know sometimes people excuse me
[7:32] tonight the devil is trying to attack my
[7:34] voice bhudev
[7:37] man you know sometimes people don't like
[7:39] being around where the Spirit of God is
[7:40] moving I just happen to like to be
[7:43] around wherever the spirits been poured
[7:46] out hit me under the fountain
[7:50] you know people well you know I guess I
[7:52] won't go back to that church or nothing
[7:54] but a bunch of holy rollers and you're
[7:56] buzzing you're just a buzzard but man
[8:00] said ain't no way your needle for an
[8:03] eagle likes to feed upon the word an
[8:05] eagle like some meat of the gospel
[8:07] an eagle likes to dig into the Word of
[8:10] God and find out what is standing about
[8:12] them listen the singing about who's who
[8:17] or anything like it's about the bride of
[8:19] Jesus Christ and we want to eat old
[8:23] Eagles food but I'm said well he said
[8:26] you know he said an eagle of God eats
[8:29] the Word of God and that alone he longs
[8:33] for he will ride through a blizzard for
[8:36] through a snowstorm and everywhere when
[8:38] he hears there's a revival going on
[8:40] he'll take off to it just as hard as he
[8:44] can listen because there's something
[8:47] inside of that man or woman that
[8:49] remembers the old barnyard that they
[8:53] came out of they remember that revival
[8:58] that they heard about it how it swept
[9:00] over the soul how it changed their lives
[9:02] how it changed their outlook because
[9:09] where the carcass is that's where you go
[9:13] find where the Spirit of God is moving
[9:16] that's where you're gonna find cause I'm
[9:19] an eagle and I'm used to eagle food I
[9:22] don't want some of this theology that
[9:25] people try to give nowadays I want the
[9:28] meat of the word
[9:30] [Applause]
[9:38] now when these Eagles get to a certain
[9:42] size comes a time when mothers got to
[9:45] stir up the nest come to time when the
[9:50] fur has to come up there comes a time
[9:52] when she throws all that stuff stuff out
[9:55] it and they begin to get a little
[9:57] sticker and and they begin to get
[9:59] uncomfortable because see she wouldn't
[10:02] want him like to be like a buzzard and
[10:04] to stay comfortable in the nest she
[10:06] wants to stir him up a little bit and
[10:08] get a revival going in them because
[10:11] she's fixing the take home on the flight

[30:37] except for Father's Day and I'll take
[30:39] father's day so we don't have somebody
[30:40] come in and then I usually preach them
[30:43] the midweek service but I'd asked for
[30:46] the Tillman brother Ron to come and God
[30:50] works so many supernatural things then
[30:54] it was beyond my comprehension
[30:57] some of them us is too personal maybe to
[31:00] even share but I'll hit the I'll hit us
[31:03] I'll hit a bunch of them tonight if the
[31:05] Lord had helped me we had a service
[31:08] brother Tim preached a powerful message
[31:10] whether on preach the first night but
[31:14] the Tim preached and then brother Ron

[43:11] this is got time you're gonna fight when
[43:16] everything that's within you you're the
[43:18] lead here tonight so this is my day this
[43:20] is my deliverance this is my hour a
[43:30] little bit a couple of months ago I had
[43:37] a dream well just to name a prophet here
[43:41] to interpret this one didn't need any
[43:43] interpretation it's pretty plain I
[43:48] dreamed that my upper cervical doctor
[43:50] I'm I'm pretty good friends with was out
[43:54] on my road in his old truck that he is
[43:59] restoring and he was looking for parts
[44:06] you don't come out on my road looking
[44:10] for parts for that old of the truck cuz
[44:13] they ain't out there there's a salvage
[44:15] yard out there but he didn't get them
[44:16] come apart by the 1940-something pickup
[44:22] and I wake up at five or six 2627 and I
[44:31] look over at my phone and I had a text
[44:34] from this doctor he send it at 5:44 I
[44:40] guess he couldn't wait I'm glad he
[44:41] didn't send it at 3:15 when when he was
[44:44] awake and had all this come to him here
[44:47] since this textile know I woke at 3:15
[44:50] this morning with a burden this lure
[44:52] this was back when school was just
[44:53] starting I know that many children in
[44:55] school and God's people had been sent in
[44:57] a similar burden to pray over our
[44:59] children in loved ones I feel like the
[45:01] Holy Spirit sent a different burden
[45:03] through though instead of praying over
[45:06] the millions of children and staff and
[45:08] church staff and people in public places
[45:11] my burden is for less people far less
[45:14] people my burden the Holy Spirit
[45:17] revealed to me was to pray a simple for
[45:18] a simple few he said the prayer is for
[45:22] the loss and devil possessed who would
[45:24] commit those terrible crimes of taking
[45:27] machine guns in the schools and mowing
[45:30] down children they said there's nothing
[45:35] there's only a handful of these kind of
[45:37] people he said I pray that Satan when
[45:40] Satan enter these few people they walk
[45:42] into a public place when they'd open the
[45:45] door the Holy Spirit of God would stop
[45:47] them in their tracks and as a Holy
[45:50] Spirit would enter into them he would
[45:53] wash them clean snow white clean he's
[45:57] got my attention at 6:20 in the morning
[46:04] he said in let them go go ahead and
[46:07] enter but don't do any harm and they
[46:11] would enter into their places where they
[46:12] were gonna mow down the people and they
[46:14] would testify how God just saved them
[46:16] and just stopped them from doing what
[46:19] they were gonna do to harm God's
[46:21] children God knows you knows our knows
[46:24] you all know all people's hearts and you
[46:27] can change the people's hearts now he's
[46:29] actually praying almost in this text
[46:31] change these new people
[46:33] pour out your blood over us and your
[46:35] children lord save them protect them
[46:38] convert them when they would do us harm
[46:40] save them and from them and convict them
[46:44] convict our leaders and save them cause
[46:47] the scales to fall from our eyes then we
[46:50] may see that man's laws cannot fix
[46:52] wicked hearts this guy in the preacher I
[46:58] said let them see you're the only one
[47:00] that can change men's hearts open their
[47:03] minds to the truth Lord and let our
[47:08] leaders start speaking your truth versus
[47:10] playing into the hands of Satan forgive
[47:13] me of any sins I have Lord and wash me
[47:15] of any pride or lust of the flesh that
[47:17] would inhibit my prayer from being
[47:20] answered thank you Jesus for saving me
[47:23] and providing a way for us to be with
[47:25] you I love you and thank you England
[47:31] reading this is 6:20 in the morning and
[47:34] immediately my mind goes to the Welsh
[47:37] revival and that text came back and I
[47:42] said what a burden may God answer that
[47:46] prayer what a changing experience that
[47:49] would be I said I was just dreaming
[47:52] about you you drove your old trip up
[47:56] here no trucker pair to my place looking
[47:59] for parts
[48:00] I think this dream needs interpreting
[48:05] you're looking for parts and then I wake
[48:08] and see you text so I'm not sure if
[48:11] you've ever heard of the Welsh revival
[48:12] from Wales in 1904 rebel sends you a
[48:17] clip that I've read so I copied it out
[48:21] of the message sent it to him how
[48:25] brother Dan talks about in the Welsh
[48:26] revival he said there was a time of
[48:29] Jubilee time for the Welsh people and he
[48:31] said he just started in a bunch of
[48:33] illiterate people I sent him several
[48:34] paragraphs of it I wanted to get him the
[48:37] part he's looking for parts
[48:42] I had the part if he could just grasp
[48:46] the part this is what he needed to
[48:50] restart the old truck brother Ram goes
[48:58] on you know he talks about how the
[49:00] people would put men under ditches and
[49:01] then tables they'd go in and pray and
[49:03] people would follow to the convicting
[49:05] power of God when they'd go across the
[49:08] culvert or into a restaurant he went on
[49:12] into the city and asked for missing
[49:13] tasks the busing at the table and the
[49:15] dinner was served he said Lord God bring
[49:20] conviction every man or woman that sits
[49:22] at this table and I said that's the kind
[49:26] brother and goes that's the kind of
[49:28] revival that we need tonight where God
[49:31] gets out amongst the people he gets out
[49:36] amongst the people people begin having a
[49:40] revival let me just declare something to
[49:43] you right now he's amongst the people
[49:45] he's been amongst it out for months he's
[49:48] been stirring the mass stop he's getting
[49:51] us ready for translation he's getting us
[49:54] ready for one final flight
[49:57] [Applause]
[50:01] I didn't know if he'd respond back to
[50:10] lon I thought that mount of choked him
[50:14] he text back that is awesome I love it
[50:22] and it's a hundred percent exactly right
[50:29] he may never accept the fullness of the
[50:32] message of the hour but Hattie right
[50:35] just said the right word she said
[50:39] brother panic that's nothing but the
[50:42] truth and this doctor says that's
[50:45] exactly right God can change the
[50:53] direction of the nation if he wants to
[50:55] do we need to call down fire from heaven
[50:58] set it loose on this place so people are
[51:01] saved and here the name of Jesus

[1:36:01] to touch us this is our revival this is
[1:36:04] our moment we're here we're here it's
[1:36:08] not coming it's here for Eagles we're
[1:36:14] born to fly higher a Norma to fly higher
[1:36:18] [Applause]
[1:36:22] the winds of faith are taking off life's
[1:36:27] are being restored parts were being
[1:36:29] restored back in a dream there's been
[1:36:32] parts of your family that are sitting in
[1:36:34] a building tonight that were restored
[1:36:36] because of a part of a message coming by
[1:36:38] the way
[1:36:40] but I don't believe just part of its
[1:36:42] coming by their way I believe all of its
[1:36:45] coming by their way when that which is
[1:36:51] perfect is come that which was in
[1:36:54] Florida's done away I want you to go to
[1:36:58] giving God praise for everything he's
[1:37:01] done for you everything he's gonna do
[1:37:05] for you
[1:37:07] you got a right to preach
[1:37:12] a man that preached to you tonight Satan
[1:37:14] has swore that he would kill his life
[1:37:17] try to put all types of different
[1:37:19] diseases on him sarcoidosis tick fever
[1:37:23] all types of different things but
[1:37:25] tonight you heard from a man of God that
[1:37:29] Satan tried its best to destroy but what
[1:37:36] God puts his hands on the devil can do
[1:37:41] all he wants to he can roar or he wants
[1:37:43] to but I have to say that there was a
[1:37:45] line that was roaring tonight
[1:37:46] [Applause]
[1:37:55] and Satan is defeated whether samwer
[1:38:01] threat to him we're a threat to him I
[1:38:05] want you to look at your neighbor until
[1:38:08] your neighbor said I'm a threat to Satan
[1:38:10] you may be the weakest Christian in here
[1:38:13] but you're a threat to Satan because the
[1:38:15] Prophet said that when the weakest of
[1:38:17] Christians goes on their knees Hale
[1:38:18] trembles
[1:38:19] I'd say Hale has had some earthquakes
[1:38:22] tonight over and over and over they're
[1:38:29] worried about San Andreas Fault Hale is
[1:38:33] disturbed tonight and we know where
[1:38:37] we're at we know where we're at
[1:38:40] a little
[1:38:43] I can't wait for part two oh the best is
[1:38:50] yet to come join us tomorrow if there is
[1:38:55] a tomorrow because I'm looking up
[1:38:58] tonight

[1:39:09] God where the Eagles are gathering

[1:39:15] natural that we're sighting but I want
[1:39:17] you to look around this is a gathering
