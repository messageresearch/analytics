TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] h l [Music] for [Music] you am all [Music] yes [Music] am [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] could we stand please [Music] you may be seated stand right out there we would like to thank each and every one of you for coming on this glorious day it's an incredible event and all of our Lives we're just thankful that we can be a part of it and God is so great to us I would first of all like to congratulate you brother Chester and you sister Hannah for coming to this day I would especially like to congratulate your father this is a great day we so love each and every one of you and thank you for being here it's a time when families gather together it's it's an important event we come to we thank you for taking your time to be here today to witness what God is doing in lives today sometimes we look at things how can two become one but today you're going to witness two individuals becoming one and then in their life 3 4 5 6 7 nothing the scripture says and tells us that God is the author of love the Bible teaches us that God is love and love comes from God from the very beginning the Bible is a love story that we read of God's love for his people and he displayed it all throughout the scriptures we heard it this morning about elesar going to get Isaac upright God has displayed that I cannot even hardly imagine under the great canopy of the Garden of Eden God is so so built Eden to wear that it was a perfect paradise and then of all the animals the greatest he would create an image of himself but in himself he saw himself lonely so God created a helpmate for him today brother Chester that's what he's done for you life is a struggle it's difficult it's difficult at its best so he's brought a helper for you there will be responsibilities will come along that now you become her head now you that's not for you to demand that's for you to earn leadership true Christian leadership so today when we say God is love we want the love of God for our marriage sister Hannah you've longed for this day you've had dreams about it images of it but today you're going to step on the stage and it's going to happen but God has trained you through life to be a real Christian and now from this step you be a Christian lady to be a homemaker at home maybe to work a bit but to take care of brother Chester and you be good to him you be good to him and you be good to her pick up your clothes so today God has led us to life's companion we can't hardly understand how he does it for years we're looking and looking and then all of a sudden a spark takes place and and now here we are we pinch ourself and now here we are so today he has led us to life's companion and I thank God that he properly answers our prayer today Chester Theodore Bennett will you have this woman to be your wife to live together in the Holy Covenant of marriage will you love her comfort her honor her and keep her in sickness and in health forsaking all others and be faithful to her as long of the both of you shall live if so will you answer I will I will sister Hannah will you have this man to be your husband to live together in the Holy Covenant of marriage will you love him comfort him honor and keep him and in sickness and in health forsaking all others and be faithful to him as long as the both of you shall live if so answer I will who has given this woman to be married to this man go get her let's all pray Heavenly Father we come before you just now in this moment Lord you you see this husband and wife as they're getting ready to join together in holy matrimony father this wedding looks a lot like many others that take place in the world but the major difference in this wedding and others is your presence father and Lord we're asking that your presence Lord as these vows are being exchanged it's not in front of men and just these Witnesses but it's in front of almighty God and I pray father that you'd hear these vows father and I pray that you'd seal them with love we pray blessings upon brother Chester and sister Hannah in the coming days and may you just come amongst us today and bless us in Jesus name amen marriage is a gift of God it is given to comfort our life and magnify its Joys marriage is a clasping of hands and the blending of hearts and the union of two lives becoming one brother Chester sister Hannah your marriage must stand not by the authority of the state nor by the Seal of your wedding certificate but rather it must stand by the strength of Your Love it must stand by your Devotion to one another in good times and in bad times finally it must stand in the very Mind Of God marriage is the greatest relationship that humans can enter into in order for a marriage to reach its full potential you must allow God to take it the prim role in your relationship he knows your thoughts he knows your needs he understands your hearts even your love to one another it in fact God created the love that you are experiencing right now we can easily say that God knows everything better than even you know if you include him in everything that you do you will become keenly aware that he's very near all the time Keep Your Home sensitive to the Holy Spirit Keep Your Home full of love Keep Your Home full of joy and when the negative enemy comes show him the door the greatest place that you will ever find real help is on your knees in prayer clasping hands and praying it's not just in the mornings and at night but the enemy would like to come and divide he comes to kill to steal and to destroy and it's just like your relationship with God the enemy would like to cause you to become backslidden cold and indifferent but you have a prayer meeting with God and it'll renew you like never before and the fire will burn the enemy will also try to do that to your marriage and little things will come on it's life but remember you step from eternity into time and through time you'll spend with each other and one of these days you'll step back into eternity again brother Chester sister Hannah I enjoy seeing you holding your hands now but I can't wait till I maybe walking down the streets of gold and and I look across the street and I was a part of this day and I'll see you there on that day and the same love you feel here you'll feel there isn't God just so wonderful ful to us sorry I got you're not nervous I just got emotional keep your eyes on God keep your eyes on the source of Love keep your eyes on the source of strength and more than anything don't let let anybody get between you and each other always be conscious you have invited the Lord to be a part of this marriage he will sit with you at your table he will be with you wherever you're at may God bless you are you ready to take your vows all right brother Chester I need you to repeat after me if you will I Chester take you Hannah iester take you Hannah to be my wife to be my wife to have to hold to have to hold from this day

would speak with tongues of men and angels but have not love I am only a sounding brass and a tinkling symbol if I have the gift of Prophecy and cannot fathom all the Mysteries and the knowledge and if I have faith that can move mountains but have not love I am nothing and if I possess all to give to the poor and surrender my body to the flames and I have not love I nothing love is patient love is kind it does not envy and it does not boast it is not proud it is not rude it is not self-seeking it is not easily angered it keeps no record of wrongs love does not Delight itself in evil but rejoices in truth brother Chester it always protects and it always trust and in all three of these faith hope and love but the greatest of this is love having this kind of love in your hearts you have
