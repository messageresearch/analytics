TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Applause] [Music] walking down the street Billy said to me he said Dan how does God ever know who they all are I said all right son look right straight up towards the skies I said see those two little stars up there almost together yeah I said if one of them science tells us one of them star to the Earth at a million miles an hour had takeen millions of years to get here that's how far it is away and yet those two stars are closer to each other than we are to the star or we're probably closer to the star and they are to us he said how does God ever do it I said he's infinite we just heard a lecture from Einstein this galaxy in the constellation and he said if a a person could leave the Earth one of his great speeches last ones if a person could leave the Earth at the speed of light that's um 8 186,000 miles per second 186,000 miles per second and would travel 150 million light years he would arrive there and then it take him 150 million likes years to come back that would be so many billions of years you could run a Roy NES around the earth and not break it down and talking about years you know how long youve been gone from the earth 50 years in our time we're in such a Hur what if a little ant started from Tucson to come up here to Bakerfield how far you think he would get in 40 years probably a half a mile see it means so much to him to us it meant 12 hours driving to a jet plane just a few seconds to God nothing Jesus died yesterday afternoon he was crucified Paul died yesterday 1,000 years is is a day with God as it was not even that but if you want to count the time so those Apostles and things died yesterday we're hurrying we ain't got a little bit of time to stay here then you think when you look at eternity Einstein the great philosopher said or the great scientist said that there's only one sensible way to explain the origin of this Earth that was found in Hebrews the 11th chapter in the third Birth by faith we understand God framed the world out of things he spoke it into existence how does it stand in the sky never gets out of its orbit how that every thing in heaven in that constellation if one of those stars that move I know you go out at night say I've seen a star shooting all you've seen a weather light star don't move if that star would move we'd move with it everything in heaven is so much in harmony it holds one another together what if mankind could be that way to hold the church together that we could all be in harmony with the word only one way let God be his own interpreter and we will be God's his interpreter of that that [Music] [Music] for [Music] [Music] [Music] I unto [Music] thee Oh guen My Feet hold my hand great with the that I may stand since you reach down his head for me aren't you glad of that when

say hello to each and every one of you and and uh we greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and certainly enjoyed the singing and uh just feels like the presence of the Lord is in this place what a meeting last night I I I so enjoyed that I just I I was up during the night and I was just thinking on those thoughts you know brother brandham says he said when Moses he said God he said Moses was just Moses he said but when God came it was God speaking through Moses and we're just men but when God comes and he speaks to us and uses us as an instrument and we just so uh he would say this he said may God give me a temporary resurrection and borrow my body amen I Pro maybe some of you watched last night I would hope it most of you did but I we announced that on November the 11th of this last week of uh we had we had took the coin with us that brother Kelly brought and uh we announced this this week that uh yesterday uh we don't have any of the final final results yet from the doctors and and so but we've we've got a few of those but Dr gon is my is my main oncologist doctor and she's a she's Catholic by belief and she's just a wonderful doctor she's a wonderful doctor and so anyway she she just said she said just just just wonderful results are happening and so we got the results of the of the lungs and she read them to us and she said now i' she said we're still waiting on radi ol ologist to read them and then give us give us and we'll interpret it and um and so kind of give us what we mean but when we first started this we we found out that we had brother Nathaniel could probably explain it better than we had we had nodules in our lungs and they were cancerous nodules it was it was a maatic melanoma which is a bleeder which which which moves through the body very quick quickly and basically they gave us a death sentence and uh because when it went to the to the brain and so on Wednesday we went to get our scans and our our scans came back on our lungs and I found this interesting that I got this scan on aena butt's birthday and if you remember Elena buts had had cancer all in her lungs and it was completely black and uh and I got a scan back on my lungs that said that those tumors were resolved Hallelujah Hallelujah now I don't know what all that means and and I've got to continue to to because we've got brain tumors that we're dealing with and and and then they're look they're looking but you know I I just know this that God don't start a work that he don't [Applause] finish I like it don't you he don't start a work he don't finish I want to say it again he don't start at work but he don't finish now I was in the shower this morning when I was thinking about this and I'm I'm sorry I wasn't in a three-piece suit and I got to thinking about that you know Elena she sang for her birthday on on Wednesday night and uh and if we could just go back for a few moments that uh a Elena was having tremendous issues with this cancer and she was sitting in service and she she had had the the whatever you call it on her head and and she was just sitting back in the mezzanine where she could not where she could not uh you know she wouldn't be with other people or maybe get any germs and those are some of the things that I've been recommended to do as well but she was sitting by back there and brother Tim PR had preached and then he started singing leaning on the Everlasting Arms and you know sometimes we think that we're just in another service on and maybe even people here last night thought well we're just in another service and the pillar of fire was visible listen it can't get better than that yeah oh I'm waiting for this to happen or that let me just say it's happening and she's sitting back there and leaning on the Everlasting Arms is is and something struck her and when it struck her even in that condition no doctor standing there saying you're going to get well but the word was saying she was going to get well and she took God at his word and she ran around that building and ran and ran and ran I'll tell you today she's cancer free Hallelujah you remember brother Tim PR's dream the Les of 12 you know no man can can do this but every 12 weeks I have went for test and if you remember the buzzards were fed to the pigs and it would happen at the at the 12 cycles and here we are again at another 12 cycle that devil must be shaking in hell because he came in for a death blow to one of God seat and I want to say this like Aaron Oglesby says he didn't have enough brother Andrew sent me a note this week and on Wednesday and he said today is the day I love you with all my heart this past year look what God has said to us these are the titles of the sermons that you've heard he's got this December the 22nd if you'll trust me I'll use you like never before brother Roy shrewbury calls and says brother Ron you're getting ready to go into a place that no man's ever came out of like Daniel but remember Daniel's last words oh King I'll see you in the morning we might as well just have a we might as well have church I preached a sermon laying it all on the line I sent Andrew a note on 410 20 I was just in prayer and waiting and this is what I heard his voice respond to me I did not ask you to do what you did not have the capacity to do hallu I might just dismiss after all this the man in the arena how many remember that sermon it's the man who smells the breath of the enemy and his size and his strength it is not those that are sitting in the crowd they may be for you they may be praying with you but they're not feeling his hot breath they don't know the daytoday war war that is going on but they're with you they're they're in the battle with you statements were it is the battle that God designed for the moment another sermon was we must answer the bell for the challenge of the hour the sermon that inspired us to go to Louis Iana I must get to Jesus how many remember that sermon are you awake look over at your neighbor say are you awake the angel of the Lord spoke to me said look past what you see and think past what you think another sermon is as God is your partner you better have big plans another sermon was who is Jesus and I spoke that if you remember I think it was three times who is Jesus a very prophetic sermon that began to be SP spoken last summer and God dealt with me to speak of David when Satan took or or when the when the enemy came and took everything that he had and God spoke to him even his own men and audience wanted to kill him and God spoke to me to take a sermon called take it back if you haven't if you can't remember that sermon I would encourage you to go back and listen to that sermon and then think on the last year of what has happened another sermon was called the music is more important than the struggle another sermon was the Gates of Hell will not Prevail another sermon was called true repentance another sermon was called ring the bell and in that sermon we we came to a point to where that we're going to have a bell ringing and to make sure brother Joe Green ordered me a a fight but and I believe in just a matter of a short time I'm going to bring that Bell I preached a few weeks ago on who is Ron Spencer who are you that's right because we've got more Authority than an angel in heaven and we sometimes forget who we are just only a couple of weeks ago I preached a sermon called God is bigger than your problems I just read you off a list and Andrew felt inspired to to to give that and he was speaking back in the back room and when I heard it I thought that needs to be in the front of the sermon these sermons were not delivered by a man in perfect health these sermons were delivered by the anointing of God regardless of a stage four cancer don't bring me your excuse of why you can't serve [Applause] God hallelujah I am determined I'm determined Hallelujah brother Ron aren't you afraid of what could come you're fighting all of these other things let me just say if he's got me here he'll get me [Applause] there as you can tell I didn't come to play this morning so here we are are now so many times we are in an age to where that we've heard the prophet say that there's going to come a time to where there's going to be missing limbs in the third pole we are in the third pole we are in the bride's Revival we're not looking for those things in the future in this process he has restored organs not just Ron Spencer but what about Karen Esther puit are you with me now brother Tim said her hairs growing back and said some of the places where she had ball spots in those spots the hair is coming back just full and and literally the day the day the the hours before surgery they told brother Tim that she would probably be a vegetable the rest of the life should we even do the surgery she's not a vegetable she's not in a rest home she's not in a rehab she'll be in church in a few moments when we when we saw help me with a name uh bring free Tims no hair alapa when Mariah forgive me I'm having those moments I actually spoke to the doctor about it and he said ah just get help so I went and got help when Mariah lost all of her hair are you with me and they say there's no cure for it are you with me brother Tim prayed for her he felt led to pray for her and I don't remember the month just now I'm struggling with a little bit of those but let me to say this to you she came through spring camp no hair with three bobby pins and God restored her hair let me just say it if you if you if you can't see God moving now if that don't cause you to be desperate before God and lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us hallelujah that's the kind of God that can bring open the graves 2,000 years not just graves in a ground but the sea has to give forth of the resurrection power of Jesus Christ the dead and the Sea will come [Applause] forth Hallelujah not just that this is a miracle that is in the process of going on but I want to tell you another one I'm getting ready to get a new body I'm not just talking about cancer free I'm talking about grave free I'm talking about Glasses free I'm talking about pain free it'll be a body like unto his own glorious body you can stand and let's go to the scripture so with all of that in mind I want to preach on this morning can't stop this you can't stop this yes sir why don't you just tell the devil Can't Stop stop this Matthew chapter 6 and verse 9 hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Hallelujah and after this manner therefore pray ye Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever second Peter chapter 1 and verse 10 if you don't have it in your Bible there just look up there on the screen wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling an election sure for if we do these things you shall never fail for such an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly unto the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ wherefore I will not be negligent to put a you always in remembrance of these things though you know them and be established in the present truth yay I think it meet as long as I am in this Tabernacle to stir up by putting you in remembrance knowing that shortly I must put off this tab this my Tabernacle even as the Lord Jesus Christ has showed me moreover I will endeavor that ye may be able after my deceased to have these things always in remembrance for we have not followed cunningly devis fables when we made known unto you the power and the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ but were eyewitnesses of his majesty for we receive from God the Father honoring Glory when there was such a voice to to him the ex excellent Glory this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased and this voice which came from heaven we hurt when we were with him in the Holy Mountain we have also a more sure word of Prophecy wherein do you do well that you take Eed as a light that shineth in a dark place until the day Dawn and the day star arise in your heart knowing this first that no Prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation for the prophecy came not in Old Time by the will of man but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost you may be seated this is the theme of the sermon today he is on his way that's right he is on his way and Satan knows that there is nothing that he can do to stop [Applause] him I want that just to settle in he is on his way and Satan knows that there is nothing he can do to stop him Revelations chapter 21 And1 and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea and I John saw the holy city the New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride Adorn for her husband I want you to understand this is not Hollywood wood or this is not Disney World just as much as God said in the beginning in Genesis chapter 1 and God spoke the word and he believed his own word and it came into existence this is the same God that says I saw a new Heaven and I saw a new Earth it is not at if it's going to happen are you with me it's already laid down in the plans of God he's already made the provisions for it to happen and there was no more sea and I John saw the holy city the New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the tabern tacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people he's talking about me here now and God himself shall be with them and be their God and God shall wipe away all the tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor cry neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away and he that sat upon the throne said behold I make all things new and he said unto me right for these things are true and faithful and he said unto me it is done I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end and I will give unto you that is a thirst the Fountain of of Life freely he that overcometh he that overcometh shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son but the fearful and the unbelieving and the Abominable and murderers and whoremongers and Sorcerers and idolaters and all liars shall have their part in the Lake of Fire which burneth with a fire and brimstone which is a second death God not only laid out the ru rules for the Overcomer but he laid out the rules for The Sinner and just as much as there's going to be a real heaven there's going to be a real hell and you've got an opportunity right now to avoid the second part come on Church take courage I say to those your loved ones that are laying out a church and doing things they know that they don't need to be doing somebody wrote me a note the other day and said you know remember me and remember me and went on for a bit and I said just do what you know you need to do I can't overcome for you but God gave you the prescription he gave you the inoculation be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and then you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for This Promise is unto you and to your children and as a many a far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call and brother Brenham said that Apostolic age is still going on today give the Lord a great hand of the [Applause] god but the man said God is his own interpreter he don't need anybody to interpret for him he does his own interpreting who is the man that can interpret God God is his own interpreter you say well brother Ron God made promises and now hundreds of years later God let me just say this you in the speck of Eternity Jesus just died yesterday afternoon I believe brother brandham said in the space of time or space of of Miles those things don't don't come in the mind of God he he said let there be a universe and how many sons did he create last reading I read was it was 71 different solar systems my God's a big God my God's a great big God Amen he's a great big God and down here on this little old little old Earth down here don't you get carried away with your houses and your homes and your jobs and your IRA accounts or who's the president or who's not the president don't even get absorbed in all those things don't get absorbed in how pretty your little old body is worth its 84 cents you get you get absorbed in this Jesus Christ who is the author and the finisher of our faith who knows when our beginning is and knows when our end is he holds it all in his hands he's still the mighty conqueror today he's still owns it all he's still God [Applause] God is worth no more than his word and if his word is no good then he is no good if your word if I can't put confidence in in what you say you're no good but what you're just as good as your word is and God is just as good as his word is and I as a Christian believer I believe that the Bible is inspired and it's written by the Holy Spirit and it is the infallible word of God I'm not interested in what people say is mistakes in the Bible I'm not interested in what people say is mistakes in the message amen I'm not interested in what people say is mistakes in William branom neither am I'm interested in what's mistakes in you the blood of Jesus Christ covers all of that there's a lot of books at Barnes and Noble there's books that set on bookshelves that's worth thousands of dollars but this book that I hold in my hand has the answer to every problem that you will ever have in your life it's the answer to your marriage it's the answer to your raising children it's the answer to your finances it's the answer to every disease that's in your body it's the complete answer to Redemption it's the answer from where you came from to where you're going it is the infallible word of God brother Ron I didn't come to listen to a sermon like this go home you're dismissed go home brother Ron I don't like it I'm streaming I don't like it turn me off but I'm telling you there's going to be a Rapture there's going to be a resurrection there's going to be a body change Hallelujah Jesus stood there with his disciples and he said let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions and if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you Ryan Spencer [Applause] Hallelujah I believe that the Bible is inspired I believe it's written by the Holy Spirit it is the infallible word of God and God is under obligation to his word to the believer that will accept his word and any word is a seed and if you'll accept it in your heart by faith and believe it and confess it God will bring it to pass brother BR says we live in a day of uncertainty it's an uncertain time I want to ask you something I try to teach just just for a moment to refer to this to these context here in the scriptures I'd like to ask you anything that is uncertain cannot be trusted and if it's uncertain you can't trust it Paul said here if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound how shall we prepare ourselves for battle now uncertainty there never was a time that things was so uncertain as today if he could say this in 1962 what about today and anything that's uncertain can not be trusted uncertainty how many times we get up in the mornings and we look at the weather and we know that they only hit it about 177% of the time maybe a baseball player because there's a lot of numbers in baseball nobody would keep a baseball player on their on their roster you're right that was only hitting 177% of the time he wouldn't last very long tens of thousands over the past few months have went and listened to presidential candidates who they will later fact check and in some places 80% of what they said only weeks before they were contrary to what they said today so people know that they're going to hear a lie churches set full of people around the world on every corner knowing that the preachers ruled by a deacon board or a trustee board or by a seminary teaching and knowing the word of God said if you take away or you add to it your name will be taken out of the Book of Life what a responsibility we got as a ministers we have a mandate that this word be true yet their houses of worship set full of prostitutes Bob ter Jezebel we see shequ sitting all over their [Applause] building and they can sit in a church on Sunday morning and on Sunday night there at another place Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday but brother Ron that's pretty tough I'm not running for president I'm not interested in your political agenda you didn't hire me you can't fire me I'm not worried about your [Applause] money thank God we don't have a bunch of artificial plant sitting all over this building who cringe at every word that is said across this pull pit and want to talk to me in the office afterward and give me a a beating because that it didn't go just the way that they wanted to do first of all this church ain't run like that if you got an opinion keep it to yourself [Applause] but I tell you do I will tell you this is not a halfway house this not a transition unit this is a transformation house where you can come here and be a prostitute and get saved and never go back to that life again a drunk a filthy religious believer are you with me full of Creeds and dogmas and the blood of Jesus Christ can wash every Sin from your life every ounce of unbelief from you and prepare you for the Rapture we're not interested in building mega church here that's not my interest my interest is to get you from this realm to that real and when we're sitting at the marriage table of the marriage supper of the lamb and I look across at the table sister Stephanie brother je Jerry and I look over there and you're sitting there in your new bodies and you're looking over Hallelujah and we're sitting there we can say thank God we made [Applause] it because that's going to happen just as sure as I'm standing here in this Pulpit that realm is more real than this realm we're looking for the day of complete restoration we have been watching over the last 11 10 11 months a body that be taken to the Realms of the hands of death and then we've watched that progressively begin to get stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and one day we'll ring a bell is that not what is happen happen in this building we've watched prostitutes we've watched Men that were Tangled in all kinds of webs of sin but they came heing through years and years and coming to church and experience after experience and word upon word and it begin to change from one glory to another glory and prepare them for the Rapture come on church that's what's been going on here whether you see it or you don't see it brother Ron I didn't see the pillar of Fire doesn't mean you have to see it I didn't feel anything doesn't mean you have to feel it's not based on your feelings but look back in your life from where you came from to where you are now and if God can bring you from where you came from to where you are now he can take where you are now and take you to the end of the road [Applause] trying not to pass out here Noah said it's going to rain I want to ask you did it there will be the rain and there the Earth will be destroyed did he have scoffers did he have [Music] critics did it matter we got him on the Run Goliath's head's been cut off we got four more Brothers we're after right now I Isaiah said a virgin shall conceive hundreds of years later did it happen was there critics was there scoffers the Rapture is going to happen yes sir the resurrection is going to happen are there critics are there scoffers you see let me just make a statement to you your scoffer vindicates you your critic vindicat you so let their 17inch tongue whack just let them wag cuz there will come a day when the wagon will be over when the rain came everybody became a Believer when Jesus is hanging on a cross let me just say you could couldn't stop Redemption Satan knew that he had made a horrible mistake when Jesus showed up in Hell three days later and took the keys of death hell and the grave and all of those prophets and all of the Believers throughout the Old Testament that had waited on the Messiah to come he was there and he was just not there he was come to take over and take the sting out of death hell and the grave Satan you know that now I'm going to preach in two dimensions for a moment Satan you know that every demon every imp you know that you know that when God sent a prophet in this day behold I send you Elijah the prophet before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and God sent we am marry and branam into this generation were there scoffers were there critics but night after night for decades decades he stood there and told people exactly where they lived where they came from what their condition was what their address who they were praying and fall eyes came open Dead came back to life people came out of wheelchairs cancers were set free Satan you couldn't stop it [Applause] God ever makes a decision to do something a certain way he's got to Forever stay with him or he made a mistake BR says I can do anything said this right here in Harrisonburg I I make a mistake I'm fine out but God is infinite let me just say this to you people quit church because they see a mistake and somebody's sitting on a Pew that is a petty excuse the scripture said judge not lest you be judged and let me do let me just bear in mind the microscope that you are using on brother brandom or using on me or using on on Homer or using on Tim PR or Donnie Reagan or Ed Bisal or any of the Ministers of the message or Joe Green whoever you are the microscope you're using on those men are you mad brother Ron oh yeah how dare the devil pick on my buddies that's why God brought me from Stonewall Jack Jackson territory cuz right here there's a lot of fight and this church is known to be able to fight we don't fight each other we fight the devil come on your amens ought to be stronger than that the microscope that you use on those men remember that with that judgment it'll turn around and be used on you oh but brother Ron I don't profess to be anything that just means you're twofold more child of Hell well I might as well pull my coat off I'm not g to be much longer but I don't got hot sometimes God brings things to a showdown brings it to a showdown where he stands toet to Toe with goath stands with shamgar even with Elijah with his miracles and a double portion being promised to Elisha it was God that told him he'd get a double portion but Elisha's bones had been laying in the ground and his body and the senu was laying there in a cave and there was still one Miracle left to be done I I imagine there was a lot of critics there that said you know that prophet said that he would have a double portion and and his God wasn't big enough but to only give him seven or 15 or what however you want to say it only give him this amount and he still lacks one he's not done yet because God had gave that body a promise I'm going there with you he's give your body a [Applause] promise brother Ron have you forgot we've had covid deaths in this church have you forgot that the last breath that they breathed they was not 89 years old anymore but they turned into an 18year old body I'm not standing here having the mother grubs about passing from this real to that real Don't Cry For Me When I'm Gone you shout hallelujah brother Ron just got a bring a new [Applause] body Glory brother Steve Thomas left out of this body and left a wheelchair behind left a hospital bed behind and he stepped into a body that never had ALS anymore had never had none of those diseases to Captivate it anymore cuz God made him a promise are you with me I got two more quotes and then I'll finish next Sunday is that all right from that time he said I won't have time in this meeting to tell you in 1933 there this is a woman's Nation it's a number 13 it appears in the 13th chapter of a revelation 13 stars 13 stripes 13 everything's a 13 everything is a woman and remember thus sayith the Lord there will be a woman rule before the end of time in time shall either be a president or vice president hard to be a Catholic Church as a

interpreter she came back week and said brother Brown you ought to go look at that I said no oh no you remember my wife had died and and I and I was just young preacher about 24 years old I'd bir her and my baby and and we only had one little fell and that was Billy and I walked around around in this little little boy little bottle in the pocket in my pocket we didn't have enough money to get fire fire to keep his bottle warm so I put it under my under my head that's the reason he's with me today I I've been a papa mama both to him and and what that's what I promised her and and when she was dying and I kept his little little body warm and his little bottle by my own body and when he was about 10 years old I said I got I I got my own little boy over here in America I just can't can't go and look at him I I I I ain't I ain't seen Billy now for about three months I just can't look at that little boy and something said go look go look now let me just say this to you in spite of brother branham's feelings I've taken some time to read this article to you in spite of brother branham's feelings the angel told him go look in spite of the scars of his past I'm gonna preach to you in spite of your scars sir go look on this word amen yes I looked I walked over and had a little coat laying over his face and pulled it down oh my I looked around started walking away and I don't know whether you're going to believe this or not that's between you and God now let me just say I faced a man just a few years ago that told me this wasn't a true story and I told him exactly what brother brand told him he said you'll face God right that'll be between you and God let me just back this up when that preacher met me in that convention and stood in the office with me and he stood there and he got right face to face he wanted to tell me a bunch of stuff let me just say I'm no coward I got right nose to nose and told him you're going to be responsible for these scoffers oh yeah and these marriage breaks ups and these suicides oh yeah he wanted to walk away from me and I said just a moment we're getting ready to walk through that door and then we're going to go through another door you're going to walk with me and when we step through that door there's going to be Minister standing there and a photographer is going to be standing there and you're going to have your picture taken with me yeah you talking about a man hot enough to fry an egg on his face he said how do you know that I said the same way that I know that this message is true I'm not a school boy and neither am I a school boy this morning amen I'm telling Satan in another realm you can't stop this and when we walk through the door and then walk through the other door there was the minister standing and a photographer standing and they all know this is the truth I don't have to embellish stories I don't have to be some story to teller to get your attention brother brandom didn't have to just embellish a story or tell a story are you with me God stood behind it you can look back past my 30 years of Ministry of preaching this message with all my heart and you can see cancer delivered babies being born in F in WBS that was not fertile you can see limbs restored you can see eyes come open you can see the ears you can see the transformation of drunks and prostitutes you can see real Believers where hundreds run to the altar all at one time under the inspiration of God that was not Ron Spencer that was God in action and I just want to say it you don't want to believe it it's between you and God but Satan you can't stop this I said what why there's nobody around me and a hand was on my shoulder I thought what is this someone's hand laying on my shoulder and I turned to the child and I happened to notice that foot little foot legs all broke up his little foot running through through his big old ribed black socks that look familiar and I said to the chief man that was the mayor of the city could they was waiting for the father and mother to come and I thought oh my what will be that Papa and Mama think when they come and see this baby laying their all master up the other little brother he was alive so they rushed him to the hospital in a car so this little boy had been dead for about 30 minutes they was waiting for his mother and father before the Undertaker moved him and I said could I look at that boy again they raised up his little coat and I looked them little brown eyes turned back and little dark brown hair and little little panty waist his feet through his socks and I looked around and come up come there come up a hill coming from the mountain ever Evergreens wrapped WRA locked I looked around and I thought that's him oh brother I may never meet you people no more till Glory but I wish I had the strength this afternoon to explain to you what a what a feeling is that that is I want you to just notice two years but I wish that I had the strength this afternoon to explain to you what a feeling that it is and I don't mean to I don't mean to to jump into things here but you just don't know after a year after a year with Satan on my back whispering in my ear you'll not live to seek Christmas I'm telling me I'm going to leave my wife and the nightmares that I went through for months and listen by the supernatural Touch Of God them nightmares just vanished and they just left let me just break in here just for a moment share a very personal testimony with you when they went to do a biopsy on my lungs they did a biopsy under my arm but they went to do a biopsy under my lungs that's where they take a needle and they go through your back or through through your rib cage and they go in and they go go into your lungs and Pierce through your lungs and then go in and take a piece of that cancer out and I'm saying this for the critic listen just Friday I went through a test that was a very difficult test and the lady treated me pretty cruy and I thought to myself if people only knew what this body has had to go through right you see a man standing here in a pull pit that gets tired and weary and you're watching a miracle I watch people come come in put their arms like this put your yourself down in the seat well we're going to be here about 2 hours and 10 minutes you better take advantage of this two hours and 10 minutes you better hang on to every drop of this that you can get they took me in they took me in those clothes putting in those clothes I was going to have this biopsy on my lungs they put me in in the clothes for it they have a special special gowns for that that has openings in it and and when they rolled me into the room there was about I would say between between 20 and 30 because they had some people that were going to watch it students that was going to to watch it and it was a quite a it was a room connected with other rooms and different things and there was one man he was a very gentle man he was a Christian man and he said I understand you're a you're a pastor and I said I am two nurses took me and prayed with me women and they told me they said we're going to have to turn you quite a bit turn you over and over and over to find the right spot and so they just kept turning and they would bring the needle down and they get ready to go in and they go no no no no that's not it it's not what we want and they just spent they spent quite a bit of time doing that it was very painful I just have to say it was very painful it's an experience I hope I don't have to experience this week or ever again I'm very honest I'm just very honest there I was beginning to get a little Restless because they turned me so much and the man came around the head of the machine it's just a huge machine I can't remember exactly what the name of that is but he kind of just kind of poked his head in where my head was and he said Mr Spencer he said I know what you're thinking we can't find the tumors he said I know what you're thinking they're gone he said I I know what you're thinking he said but Mr Spencer your lungs are so full of those tumors we're trying to find the right one and he said we're wanting to get near to the one that's near to your to your throat and near the heart he said that's that's the one that we're wanting to get hold of Nathaniel and Sue has been with us through the through this walk of this I want to thank them for that so here we are today November the 15th and from that moment to today a man that's in that position saying your lungs are so full we're just wanting to get the right one to today they can't find them [Applause] God give me Grace for about five more minutes brother brandom said I wish I had the strength this afternoon to explain to you what a feeling that is oh all Devils Out of Hell couldn't stop it and one brace place he said you could line them all up and they couldn't stop it let me just put this in real talking points now Vision 30
