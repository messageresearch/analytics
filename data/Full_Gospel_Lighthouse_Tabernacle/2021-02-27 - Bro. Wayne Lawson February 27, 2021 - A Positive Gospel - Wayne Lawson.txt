========================================

[Music] it's strange how god does things he'll let us get right down to the last the last mile away you know he he likes to do that he did it with the hebrew children he knew who he could trust so he let that then boys walk right up to the fiery furnace so they could almost smell the fire and he never moved but when it comes time he'll move you move but he waits till his own time do you want to see what kind of a reaction they had he knew they had made their stance and when he knows that you make your stand he'll let satan take you to the last mile away just remember he's still there [Music] he wants to see if you really mean what you're talking about well i believe god's the healer yes i sure believe it and the next day you still got your pain well maybe i never got it sure you got it just want to see how you're going to react or what you say you say all praise god i believe in the baptism of the holy spirit the first little temptation comes along and plows like a birth cell trying to see your reaction on your actions he's trying to test you every son that cometh to god must first be chasing tested every child that comes to him he puts him through a test to see how he'll act

don't we we know him as an on-time god amen well if you haven't felt him here already you're numb certainly good to be in the house of the lord isn't it our expectations are so high for the weekend it's i just don't know how to explain it quite quite right or to do it quite right but we're so under expectation for what god we have prayed about these meetings and they have come to fruition last year this time we were in a very different place and for those that don't know one year ago we had just been diagnosed with lung cancer and and we knew that we were in a fight we were at stage four at that point and we were just beginning chemo treatments and uh at that time it was infusion i'm now on chemo every day about 20 pills a day at home but but at that time we were just discovering kind of where everything was at brother wayne comes and he preaches two dynamic services but on friday before the meeting i went blind to my left side and so still that way if i don't see you on the left side just just as i'm not seeing you so but anyway you know sometimes i have people say well i aren't you really concerned that that comes back i read in the scripture where a man wrestled with an angel of the lord and and there was a place in the hollow of his thigh that he always limped from from that point forward to remember that he had been visited by an angel and and so whenever i think about the blindness in my eyes and it's in both eyes i think about that god spared my life brother wayne has probably no doubt preached to meetings all over the world and they can say that there was incredible miracles that took place and a certain condition left but in our case blindness came but it alerted us to a another problem and that you know the devil is stupid and let me just clear the air for brother wayne now the devil is stupid had he not blinded me we would have never known that we had brain tumors and i would have been dead in only just a couple of weeks but because he is stupid we were able to get to the doctors and they would find the literally only a few days after brother wayne was here they would find the cancerous tumors in my brain and were able to the next friday be able to to remove a tumor about that size in my brain and it was laying on my on on my eye channels back there i forgot the word but that's where it was at so but anyway god rich and mercy spared our lives and we're a year later and this week we got wonderful news and we're happy about that and amen we told you of the dream last week of waking up and and brother branham had came to us and he gave me a green book and it was called the way of a true prophet and he asked me said would you like to have this book i used it tonight and i i looked through all my file cabinets in the last pocket i found the way of a true prophet in a green bound book amen and i choose to carry that book the rest of my life in my bible so so if you should ever ask that question i've had a prophet pat me on the cheek and tell me i'm going to get well amen amen so we're just so thrilled about that amen he's good to us sydney so i'm under i'm under expectations myself for this meeting for brother wayne he's been a real friend of mine for for a long time and and and he's just not an average preacher he he's a prince of preachers and so i i i think i think of i think of incredible speakers through the ages and and whenever i hear brother wayne he's like a lawyer and he just ties the devil in every kind of way in the world in a very quick way and i understand that there was a man named charles finney that was quite like that so so you might hear charles feeney preach for us tonight even greater than a charles feeney i i didn't come up to to do a whole lot of chit chatting but i'm on business our church is growing it's growing it's and we're really thrilled about it and sometimes it grows one at a time sometimes a family at a time but i have some wonderful news that we are going to grow in august august september-ish two at a time and we're thrilled for brother justin and sister judy they're expecting twins we are so happy for these guys there's a lot of things happening in the klein household this year uh it's going to be a busy year for them and amen queen b is just she's just gleaming and i don't know if terry will be able to contain her through the whole years two at a time and so amen we we pray with our our sisters as they're to carry their babies through and i'd like for sister judy and brother justin to come man but i don't have my mask but with me but hope that's okay my uh little brother little brother's coming too amen hallelujah you want to stand beside of me come over here stand beside of me yeah look at that you're almost tall as i am a couple more years you'll be as tall as i am and amen probably the truth too okay now what we're going to do is we're going to pray for mom they're going to be okay we're going to pray for mom and that you know the devil gets in the details he likes to get in the details of things and so amen we believe the promise of god pray that god would be with those babies amen all right now you you don't pray you don't pray in front of me you pray behind me he's gonna start preaching you hear him start preaching we're here to pray we're here to pray all right i prayed with brother ron over mom all right let's pray almighty god you see sister judy and brother justin i remember it was just only a few months ago as i looked back and i spoke to brother justin brother justin you've only just touched the tip of the iceberg god you have blessed their home in so many ways and now we receive another blessing the news of twins that are on the way now father you're the author of life and i ask you that you'd watch over these children as they're carried in sister judy's womb now lord god i pray the angels of god would be present with her and watch over her as she goes about her daily duties lord we believe that their names were in the lamb's book before the foundation of the world and lord is there to be manifested we believe that life is in the womb and lord no matter what society says we believe it's in the womb and i ask you now that you would come and bless them and watch over them and keep them safe dear god as they're there lord and may you just bless them lord jesus and lord may the spirit of god just whirl about her lord watching over her and bless these little guys he's going to be a big brother over too and we pray that you be with them in jesus christ's name amen and amen god bless you sister judy oh yeah brother justin you're to step up here tonight is four years how many times did he shoot it brother justin is a police officer in our local harrisonburg here and you remember the service sister brenda that i stepped out and we prayed we prayed for him and we quoted psalms 91 and we prayed for you in just in just an hour so a man turned loose and began to shoot it brother justin point-blank point-blank and missed him all the way and we thank the lord four years ago today love you amen isn't god good hallelujah he also just received another award that he's he actually rescued somebody's life actually saved their life and so amen we want to play pray for these boys as their police officers and you know we don't believe and defund the police here yeah we don't we don't believe in that here so you have that agenda you're welcome to leave so amen amen i don't know what part of heaven that we're going to be at but it's going to be the part that's we have our swords pulled we're ready amen well you want me to go ahead and share it we were at brother wayne's uh brother ray erickson and um we were preaching a meeting and his daughter-in-law had had how many two two miscarriages she wasn't able to carry a baby and so she came in the prayer line and she wanted a child and to be able to carry it and so so we prayed there and as we prayed we believed god and took him at his word and told her that you're going to have a child well brother wayne came last year and i was sitting right there where you are and he's preaching and he gets another prophecy sitting right there and you

and god bless you if you have your bibles tonight we'd like to go to the book of first corinthians the 14th chapter and the eighth verse corinthians 14 and verse 8 amen uh i'd like to maybe just uh speak a few moments on this tonight first corinthians 14 and the eighth verse or if the trumpet give an uncertain sound who should prepare himself for the battle amen we ask the lord bless his words you could be seated if the trumpet would give an uncertain sound who should prepare himself the battle iman you'll recognize this text from brother brown spoke on it several times in a message called the uncertain sound it's a very familiar uh writing but well i want to speak to you tonight from it and if i would take a title i want to speak to you i want to speak to you a little bit tonight about a positive gospel amen i want to speak here from a positive gospel amen knowing this that i believe i believe in positive things when you define the word positive it means expressed clearly or fully assured confident it means independent of changing circumstances unconditioned incontestable not fictitious but real it means active and ineffective in social or economic function rather than merely maintaining peace and order it's directed or moving toward a source of stimulation it means having higher electric potential and constitu constituting the part from which the current flows to the external circuit the positive terminal or discharge discharging storage battery having a good effect favorable a positive role model it means it's marked by optimism at the positive point of view if you start looking at the synonyms it means to be sure or to be certain to be positive having no doubt or uncertainty sure usually stresses the subjective uh intuitive feeling of assurance see you felt sure that i've forgotten something but certain may apply to a basing of conclusion or conviction or definite grounds of indisputable evidence see police are certain about a case of a fire because they have the positive evidence see something that is positive in other words it's something that is certain i'm positive i will win having a real or beneficial effect a result they took a positive action or had a positive experience it means beyond doubt it means unquestionable it means a positive proof a showing acceptance or approval a positive response i want to talk to you about positive and i want to talk to you about a positive gospel i say tonight that the message that we are preaching is a positive word amen i believe that i believe the message of the hour is a positive word i believe it's something that you can rest your soul on amen i i come to you tonight in the middle of probably some of the greatest political disturbances that we've had in america since the civil war there's probably not been a more divided time among america in politics and and when brother branham preaches this message trumpet uncertain sound it's actually following the elections of kennedy and brother brown is discussing how that the election was rigged to go a certain way for the catholic president and he talks about that a little bit and he says and a lot of people has put their self he said into this politics and he said they've invested themselves and he said they're fighting and they're going that way he said and look how disappointed they were with the way this election and there was nothing they could do about it it was just the way it was there was nothing they could do he said the fbi even proved that they did it and they just didn't do nothing about it amen i think we're living back in about the same kind of time amen but look at this if you put your hopes in politics look how let down this election would make you if if that's all the hopes you had look at how you invest your life and and your efforts and look at politics how quickly they can just undermine it and it changes on you everything you thinks a certain way it ain't it ain't the way you thought it was there is nothing positive at all in politics it is constantly changing on you you you'll get behind a certain candidate and you're sure you'll get a certain view and you'll think that's the way it is and all of a sudden the whole thing will change on you overnight and you'll be standing looking like a fool because see there's nothing solid in it it's it's shifting sands it's politics amen i'll say it like this even when you come to religion there's really nothing solid left in religion religion has moved itself to the un unsafe and unsteady sands of human movement and intellect and and politics and the ideals of man and it's become so uncertain politics and religion is moving right together and to think that even not just religion but but churches itself not just the religious movement but churches themselves become uncertain i i can say to you tonight that that there's churches that's going to rise and there's churches that's going to fall amen you can go into man you can go into ministries and you can watch and you can just get yourself so built up in a man but men come and men go amen men rise and men fall churches come and churches go politics come and politics go amen and and when you're listening to brother branham he goes right through this line and he he makes it a dark day he picks politics church religions and ministries and he lines them all up and he spends about a half hour letting you know there's not one solid thing in any of it and he's telling you if you're building there you're on shifting sands and you're setting yourself up for a great disappointment in your life and by the time he gets done you begin to wonder really is there anything that you can trust is there really anything when a word prophet is telling you it's all shifting sands it's all shakeable it's all moving it's all a bottomless pit when you get to hear me is there really anything that you're able to trust and all of a sudden he'll ask you is there anything left is there anything that you can put your trust in is there anything that's solid is there anything that you can build on and it won't change tomorrow is there anything that you can put your life into amen that it's not going to change on you after you invest in it amen and i'll say what the prophet of god had to say he said i'm telling you the things of the earth is shaking and you cannot put confidence in them they're uncertain and everything's that's uncertain i'd just rather leave away from it i don't like that negative thing i don't like to get mixed up in the negative side i like it positive and i want to be on the positive side i like it positive and i want to be on the positive side is that right is there anything left i want to be where it's positive i don't want to be in the negative in abraham brother bam says it like this christianity has no negative nothing in it it's everything absolutely positive a man that becomes a child of god has a positive hold on calvary and calvary has a positive hold on him with the assurance by the almighty god by an oath to himself that he would raise them up in the last day and take them into glory there is no if and or nothing about it it's something that is positive amen in jehovah jiber brother madam says christianity is misrepresented to the people christianity has been represented to the people as a declaration of a creed but christianity is a living being jesus christ the resurrected god that's alive and among us now my goodness what is christianity really then amen it's not just church or religion or politics or ideas amen christianity is the resurrected jesus christ living inside an individual and there is nothing negative about that there's nothing negative about jesus raising and descending into the church of the living god and there he stands tonight in christianity jesus on the authority of the word brother man said christianity is a living being in mankind that's a proof of the resurrection of god's son who god is with us christianity is a living being amen and hear him he'll say that's the way real christianity is it's a living experience pentecost is not a denomination pentecost is an experience that anybody can have if they wish to have it it's something that you experience it's the holy spirit my goodness amen in 1963 brother branham preaches a message called the absolute amen isn't it beautiful the absolute he said i think that we need something to be positive some absolute that we can hold on to and know that it's true in this crucial hour like this we must have something that we know we are positive that it's right something we can hold on to now now know whether how this case is going according to webster an absolute is itself unlimited in power amen primary it's an ultimate it's an ultimate it's an amen it's an absolute amen it's the end it's everything and every achievement that's ever been in the world has been tied to some sort of absolute you cannot do anything unless there is something that you can hold on to amen you cannot build your life unless you're positive of what you're building on you can't get started unless you know where you're starting and man i think it's beautiful if you go into untrip a trumpet of uncertain sound brother adam begins to say he says listen is there anything certain then is there really anything certain the prophet of god said yes there is one thing certain and i'm glad to say tonight there's one thing that you can put your confidence in ensure that it's right everything else is gone amen this will be standing if you'll read in matthew 24 35 he said the heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall not fail god has a certain foundation matthew 24 and 35 heavens and earth shall pass away but my word shall not pass away then brother branham said i'd rather be standing on the word of god than to be standing in heaven i would rather be standing on the very word of god and be standing in heaven because heaven can fail the earth can fail but the word of god it remaineth forever man when i think about this tonight i think if there's a surety somewhere then there is a foundation amen numbers the 23rd chapter and the 19th verse for god is not a man that he should lie neither the son of man that he should repent he has said and shall not do it or hath he spoken and it shall not make it good behold i have received the commandment to bless and he blessed and i cannot reverse it amen in psalms 19 and 7 i love david singing i love how the man sung he had positive songs he said for the law of the lord is perfect converting the soul the testimony of the lord is sure making wise the simple in psalms 89 and 34 he said my covenant will i not break nor will i alter the thing that is gone out of my lips then you mean there's somebody that can say something that can't take it back there is somebody that can tell you something that when they say it they don't have to change it later they don't have to rearrange it later remember when they speak it it is settled it's the finish it's the end it's the ultimate it's sure it's positive it's reality it's true it's the amen amen listen to me when god speaks anything he cannot alter it after it comes out of his mouth because the word cannot pass away it cannot change it cannot alter my amen the solomon the wisest man in the world i think we should hear from him tonight he said every word of god is pure he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him in isaiah 40 amen isaiah had it well for the grass withereth and the flower fadeth but the word of our god shall stand forever in isaiah he says it again in the 55 55th chapter and the 11th verse so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which i please and that shall prosper in the thing where unto that i sent it whenever god speaks anything that word that leaves his mouth cannot be altered that word cannot return to him until it has completed what he sent it out to do god cannot call it home and say we changed our mind god cannot speak anything and re and bring that back to him before it completes itself do you see god is positive when he speaks a word it's a positive word it's sure it's settled it's the end god has the power to do whatever he says he's going to do listen friend i know tonight amen there's things in this world that is not sure amen and you've had experiences with them and they make you question other things but there is one thing in this world that you can count on and that is the word of god when god says anything that word is finished from then on until it fulfills let me let me just say this to you amen can you imagine isaiah when he was preaching one evening it might have been a sabbath evening and he he took the scriptures and began to preach and he got under the channel of inspiration you know a prophet's a channel don't you and he'll say things that he don't even think about because if he thought about it he wouldn't have never said it amen but isaiah was up there preaching and god had control of his mind and all of a sudden he blurts out and hears himself say a virgin shall conceive amen he didn't say i think she will or maybe she will he said a virgin shall conceive and a word went out of his mouth and now watch that word started circling the earth and brother branham said it circled the earth for hundreds of years because it couldn't go home it couldn't change itself and say well amen that maybe that's just not going to happen i got to go home i can't do my job i i don't have enough to fix or fulfill what god sent me to do amen but listen every word that god speaks has the power to fulfill the word that has been spoken no word that he utters does not have the power to fulfill what god utters it out to be amen do you recognize word cannot return until it's manifested amen word cannot return until it becomes flesh when god said a virgin shall conceive go back to genesis the third chapter and see if god didn't prophesy and say the woman's seed shall bruise the head of the serpent come on church it's a positive language amen the woman's seed shall bruise the head of the serpent the woman's seed amen was the virgin birth it was it was mary seed amen and it was a positive and couldn't return until it was fulfilled amen let me say this to you tonight god said there's going to be a bride god said there'll be a virgin bride god said there'll be a bride without puerto rico he had a prophet prophesy in this earth and began to prophesy over the church and said there's coming a rapture there's coming of bride listen william branham wasn't just another preacher he was a channel of god and when he spoke that word that word is hanging over the church of the living god and it cannot go home until it becomes flesh when the word returns back it will look like you and me amen when the word returns back it'll have to take flesh with it or it cannot return my goodness when i think about this it cannot be altered amen it cannot be changed amen do you know god is looking for a mary amen a place for the word to hang in the womb to manifest and fulfill what he has spoken titus 1 and 2 amen paul says it well in hope of eternal life which god that cannot lie promised before the world began in hope of eternal life which god that cannot lie promised before the world begins so the god that can't lie made a promise if you can get somebody who can't lie to give you a promise you got it wrapped up if you if you could find somebody that can't lie the only one we know of is god and if you can get him to give you a promise you got it wrapped up you know what i'm saying if you can if you can get somebody's word on it if they don't lie then that word is as good as anything you need because it's a sure foundation i just remember my little boy zac he just had this baby i remember he used to ask me said daddy i want to fly he loved flashlights kid loved flashlights and he said daddy i get a new flashlight and and just so he quit pester me after a while i'd say yes sure son you can have a new flashlight well in the morning he would wake up with and get his boots on he's ready to go to walmart you know and i said what are we going to walmart for he said well you told me i could have a flashlight amen and then he had me he he had my own words we couldn't pass a walmart daddy you said i could have a flashlight and either i had to give him a flashlight or i had to lie to him amen so you see once he got my word he never let me forget that amen and do you know that you actually compliment god when you remind him what he said to you amen listen when god gives you his word it's his covenant and when god shakes your hand on anything he he loves it when his own people come back to him with what he told them he would do god loves it when that happens you know i think it's amazing brother bam tells a story about a man who was uh received a capital punishment was going to die and they took him out and the king he was going to give him his last wish and the fellow said really really what i want so as a good cold drink of water and the man said well i would like to have the kingston well you can have it he said yeah but i'm afraid that you're going to kill me before i get my water drink so i don't really want to ask for water the king said look i'm going to give you your wish i'm going to give you a cold drink of water and i promise you i will not kill you till you drink your water so they brought that water to him amen and the man got the water he looks at the king and he just dumps it out on the ground amen because the king told him i won't kill you till you drink the water so he had the king in a place amen they had to turn him loose he was never going to die amen because he had the word of a king well if you can get a natural king to back up his own word that strong how much more tonight if you get the word of the king of all kings amen how sure is that foundation tonight that there's a word that cannot alter as a word that cannot change mine the hope of eternal life in first peter chapter 1 and verse 25 but the word of the lord endureth forever and this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you amen the word of one that can't lie is what the gospel is preached unto you revelation chapter 3 and verse 14 and unto the angel of the church of the laodiceans write these things saith thee amen the faithful and the true witness the beginning of the creation of god amen the amen of god isn't that beautiful amen that when god speaks his word amen jesus is the amen of the word the holy ghost is the amen to the word of god i think about it tonight in isaiah it was written amen that he is the god of truth and brother man said it's better said he's the god of the amen in isaiah he said he that blesses himself is blessed amen in the god of truth or in the god of the amen in other words god he is the amen he's the absolute he's the thing that finishes you know when brother adam would finish his meetings many times he would say if what i've told you is the truth he said look he will come now and vindicate that or prove that and that angel would come in the room and back up what he was talking about amen how many times did we see it on tape or how many times did it happen time after time after time and the prophet would speak and god would show up and say that's an amen that's the word of god and let me tell you something tonight that same god is still alive and he's still coming into the church of the living god where this message is preached the god of the amen is still coming in those churches and saying amen to the word of god listen i don't have much use for a preacher that god don't back up amen i know there's a lot of intellectuals and i i know there's a lot of teachers giving us their opinion amen but i want to see somebody in the pulpit when they get done preaching that the holy ghost will come in the church of the living god amen and infuse the church with power and demonstration and manifestation we are not preaching a watered-down gospel with our gloves on this is the power of the holy ghost it's a reality in the age that we're living in this is god's word and he comes and says amen to his own word my goodness amen he is true to this word the prophet of god said he's true to himself he won't lie god is true amen god is faithful don't ever forget that god is right god is true and god is faithful amen he is true to himself he won't lie he is true to the word he will back it up he is true to us he will lose none of us her glory to god he's true to himself if he speaks something he won't lie he won't he's not a hypocrite god ain't double-minded if he says something he meant it and if he says it he backs it up amen and he's true to his people he will not lose one of his children let me tell you something tonight we are not living on on a like a cat on a chin roof wondering if god's about to lose us amen what do you think he's absent-minded or something amen but god has never forgotten nothing he's never forgot one thought if you ever was in the mind of god he still has you in his mind and he's not absent-minded but he give the blood to save every person that was in his my goodness he'll not lose a one it i don't know where he might have to go to find you but he's not going to lose you i don't know where he might have to turn over or what bar room he might have to put somebody in or what place you might have to come to but i'm servant of god that knows right where you are he knows right where to find you amen god didn't lose you he didn't lose me and he'll not lose anybody else and he's called to himself god is true he is true to his word he is true to his message he is true to his spirit god is not here tonight amen just trying to amen to dismiss us as a thought but he saves his people you're sure it's a word it's the truth oh i wish i had a better voice it's true yes it's the word of the lord he will not lose one amen i'll tell you what brother branham had to say about it he's true he said he'll raise him up he said this is a resting place in his faithfulness being confident of this very thing that he which begun a good work will perform it until the day of jesus christ you can be positive of this you can be confident of this if god started you he'll finish you amen let me tell you this he is the kind of can i say the coach he's the kind of coach who has a perfect reputation amen of first place runners and he won't pick somebody that he can't finish amen if he didn't think you could run he wouldn't have never chose you but he knew you could run so he chose you and when god chose you he knew exactly how you were going to finish amen that's why paul said amen unto him that finishes the race he meant looking to the author and the finisher of our foundation we are not looking at our ability tonight we're looking at the word and we're running like we've never ran before let me say this there's a bride that's not going to fall she's not going to stumble at the line she's going to finish this race can i can i say what a prophet said here he said it's not an uncertain sound god cannot give an uncertain sound my goodness amen in other words you you've heard people they mumble once in a while i've done it myself here's what they wasn't certain what i said lady said something to us at the restaurant last night who couldn't tell what she was saying he had that mask on and a little accent behind it after a while figured out it was lobster i i got it finally amen but it was it was a it was an uncertain i knew it was it was muttered amen i hope you hear me god cannot do that god cannot mutter and uncertain sound if god says anything it is certain amen it is true creeds cannot give amen they can give an uncertain sound denominations can give an uncertain sound but god cannot give an uncertain sound and the word is god the word cannot give an uncertain sound he meant god cannot utter an uncertain sound there is no uncertainty in it brother if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound who shall prepare for the battle amen then paul is not speaking about going to a picnic he's talking about going to war when paul is talking about this he's not talking about picnic man said we didn't come here to see how many people would agree with us he said we're in a war we're in a spiritual war it's not a war against flesh and blood but against spirits and and principalities and powers amen paul is speaking about soldiers he's not speaking about picnics he's talking about going into war and brother baum says it here now paul in the scripture says he's training a soldier to a sound training a soldier to a sound you're the soldier god's sound is the trumpet playing to the church now if you'll notice this he said then the trumpet say the gospel trumpet it's the word of the living god and it don't mix with anything if you mix it with something it becomes uncertain but if we just play the music if it's just the trumpet it has a certain sound it's a positive sound now now paul brother brown says he's talking about training a man to a sound revelation 1 and 10 you remember the scripture said that john was caught up in the spirit on the lord's day amen and he said i heard a voice as a trumpet behind me then so now he's parallel in a voice and a trumpet amen and it's a clear and distinct sound it's not muttered it's not confused it's clear distinct it's a sound of truth amen listen here it's a battle amen in this end time it's actually a battle for the truth that's where we are the prophet of god uses this and serves as this enzyme he says what is it it's a battle of truth for the things that's been lost down through the ages see down through seven ages paul started out with truth and they lost things down through the ages and brother bam said but in the end time he said there'll be a battle for truth he said that'll bring it back to all the ends that were lost so everything that we lost down through the ages god is going to send some soldiers in the end time that will battle for the truth that will tie the whole thing together oh you say well brother wayne i know we're in a war and and we're doing our best to cover up but you know can i can i give you all a little a little word here tonight hey man i i sometimes think that we are looking at this whole battle just a little wrong because we look at it like we're the defending group and we're trying to survive and we're trying to make it but do you know actually scriptural that's not true do you recognize amen that when the sun comes up in the morning that the sun itself is what causes the darkness to to pierce to the other side of the earth when you turn this light on in here amen it don't remove the darkness it it concentrates it in places it can hide from the light and when the light begins to shine in the earth amen the darkness compresses itself and becomes darker and thicker because of the light can i say this to you amen when a messenger comes in an age and begins to sound the jubilee trumpet or the gospel trumpet to the church it causes a spiritual war and that spiritual war presses against every dark spirit of unbelief that there is let me just put it within within a grasp of the way a hillbilly is saying amen they really ain't after you you're after them really at this moment you don't really realize this but the stands you're taking amen is a complete contrary stand to everything in this world amen everything that's in the world today is literally going 180 degrees the other direction but there's something in you that will press against every dark thing because there's something battling for the truth on the inside of you i maybe maybe could say it this way we're not here amen just to make peace with our enemy we're not here just kick our feet up and let the devil keep our kids amen i'm sorry i'm not that type of guy amen if the devil takes after one of my kids i get down on the floor somewhere and say satan that belongs to me take your hands off of that child that's my child amen i'm not one of them guys that just lays down my sword and bows down to any old devil wants to come along in my house or in the church or anywhere else there's something down on the inside of me amen that a war against any spirit of unbelief that comes near now now i say that tonight because you know when the children of israel when they crossed the red sea and they were running from the egyptians but when they went over into the into the jordan and they got to the jordan river do you know things changed at the jordan and they actually moved from a defensive to an offensive battle it went from running to an enemy into running to the battle they went from trying to escape the battle until they were the ones pushing the battle they literally went out there to the walls of jericho amen where little rahab was amen do you all know amen that rahab couldn't come out in the jubilee amen because she was behind the walls and she was a gentile so whenever the jubilee comes she was not able to come out at all but look at what god did amen he could have delivered jericho many ways but because of his own law preventing rahab from being brought out behind them walls by a trumpet god decided amen if i can't bring them out i'll tear the walls down amen you know what god did he instructed joshua to tear down the wall amen that was holding his child do you know god will not leave a wall when a child of god's at stake and god will not leave something just in his place but he'll tear that down watch what he done he instructed joshua to go out there and take the take the priest and and take their trumpets and they took seven of them and and they was walk around one time a day and blow their trumpet and up through seven ages one messenger per age would walk around and the people were quietened and the trumpet was blowing one one in age amen but when you come to that seventh one amen seven trumpets blowed at the same time in other words it was just one messenger but you were hearing seven thunders it was just one messenger but he was tying up every loose end from paul all the way to the end time in other words his message wasn't just one age he was collecting the truths throughout seven ages and preaching them in one message you see what you do you don't have to dig through all the history books to find the truth now you don't have to dig through all the men that went on to find out what the truth is now am i have i got some liberty here amen you see there there's some uh there's some guys that's leaving and then they're they're they're running for the hills i guess i don't know what's battle with them amen but they started claiming that brother branham got his ideas from a guy named larkin and they they were saying the other day one of them was saying uh well you know he said brother ram took this from larkin took something else and this and that and act like larkin had a had all this and brother bam come in behind him and i'm sitting there listening to him i thought it was funny because see i i study i study a lot of books and i've read a lot of books and everything that he was saying i knew 10 years ago i went through dispensations of larkin 10 years ago i studied all those books read all those things found out what the prophet said about them amen so when he come along and said that i just kind of chuckled because i know the rest of the story amen because see charles larkin was not a prophet and he didn't sit down somewhere in a room and an angel come to him and give him all that and brother branham just copy it that's not the way it happened at all but charles larkin borrowed things that was taught from paul all the way up to his day he took things from all kinds of theologians and he collected this see the people that say brother brown copied larkin don't tell you where larkin got what he got he got things from all of those men down through the ages but when brother branham read them charles larkin was not positive on many things he would come up and he'd say well maybe it's this or maybe it's that we're not really sure you know what that's called it's called a loose end i give you two scriptures and i caused the question and i never answered it amen but william branham took what larkin did and brought it out into the positive and took and said this is that and this is that scripture and this is that scripture you see what it was god was using him to tie those loose ends together and he took things that they knew and then finished the sentence listen friends this message isn't just another idea this message is the word of the lord in the age that we're living in you can rest your soul yes sir you can rest your soul upon this message it's not just another good idea amen it's god's grace to the age that we're living in my when i look at this and i see what happened really amen then joshua when they began to blow them trumpets and that message come out with all the ages in one message amen everything larkin had and everything luther had and everything wesley had and everything paul had it sounded under one message are you hear me and what happened that trumpet ignited something it didn't just blow but it ignited a voice in the entire people of god and the bible said they become one voice and the walls had to come down let me tell you something tonight this message has made one voice it's made one bride that's saying what the message says and that message is saying tear down the wild and let the children of god come out into liberty i don't know if you're hearing me tonight amen but i believe it's time to declare war on every denominational spirit it's time to declare war amen don't ever lie the devil ever told you every uncertain idea that's ever come it's time to declare war on that he said preacher what are you saying i'm saying brother branham said that end time messenger would declare war on every false doctrine amen their understandings of predestination and their thoughts amen about water baptism and their thoughts about the church ages and about the seals denominations taught all that but here come a prophet and begin to say i'm not doing this for prejudice but i'm doing it for the word of god listen to me tonight we've got something here that you can declare war on every devil that's ever come to you and say that you're not a child of god you're never going to make it there's no way you're ever going to rise up that high i believe tonight that we've got a word that we can go right to that devil and say satan you are a liar you're a liar from the beginning i am certain who i am i am searching where i come from i'm not here confused tonight we are not confused about this message tonight this is the word of the lord unto jerubal i both laid the foundation and i shall set the headstone whoa glory to god it's time church to declare war on that depression spirit on that nervousness we declare war are you hearing me amen we're not just gonna let cancer run away with our pastor we declared war on that cancer and we say cancer you've got no right to be in this body we declare we are on that thing it's trespassing on god's property and we've got every right to declare war and to curse that devil y'all remember don't you pick up a rock bride and throw it back amen we declare war against every demon power [Applause] devil said to me this morning are you sure it's the will of god that brother ron be healed you know what i did i said well i'll tell you this god ain't told me he wouldn't be healed and the bible said i would that you would prosper above all things prosper in health it's the will of god to heal a man it's the will of god to save a man it's the will of god to give you the holy ghost amen god said by my strengths you are healed [Applause] if god ain't give you a vision amen that he wouldn't be healed then why would you believe he will be healed hallelujah but you lost your mind no i not lost my mind i'm in war i got my helmet on i got my feet shut i'm wearing a breastplate i got a sword in my hand amen ain't no devil safe tonight ain't no devil safe in the house of god every depression spirit every neurotic devil every bevel of unbelief and discouragement i agree thee by the voice of the living god i rebuke you satan you have no power over the children of god [Applause] so preacher what are you talking about i'm talking about something certain i'm talking about people declaring war leaving this defensive life and going to an offense go take what the devil took from you go take back what the devil took [Applause] you're gonna leave it in the arms of no devil he got your kid go get him got your daughter go get her said preacher what you lost your mind no i'm not time is short i'm not i'm not trying to sign no peace treaties with the devil got got no there's no there's no peace between me and him he said well wouldn't it be better to make peace would it really is what jehu said he said there'd be no peace to your mama's dead until that jezebel dies there'll be no peace and i'll tell you as long as there's a devil haunting your life you are to say devil you ain't gonna live in peace because i can't live in peace [Applause] i won't leave you hiding our hair don't give a devil a place to stand you see brother madam tells us this he tells god he'll give you something's unnecessary he said the government don't give you things unnecessary like he said if somebody fails to go off to war he said they'll train them stateside and put them in a camp over here and train them stateside boy never been to war amen and they come out and put a 90-pound pack on his back and boots on his feet and helmet on his head and it's 100 degrees out there and he's trying to pack that thing and them boots is uncomfortable got that heavy gun it ain't heavy but after 14 miles it gets heavy put that big backpack on and he's walking down the street down here right there ain't no germans they ain't no japs they ain't ain't no ain't no enemies of any kind uh you germans forgive me i was mean you know i know they're watching you know what i mean we're talking spiritually guys well well they there's no there's no enemy inside there's none of that in sight so he'll look over at his pal and said what we got to pack this for what we got to do this for well you know where they're standing can't answer that question but after they put them on a boat and ship them over there and they trying to run up on them beaches and they got guns narrowing down on them and bombs going off around them and they find out why it's necessary and you know what i found out why things are going good and the church is in good good shape and everything's happening and you got preachers preaching the baptism of the holy ghost as people said why is that necessary why is it necessary to tell people about the holy ghost and new birth and the gifts of the spirit and the power of god we don't even need them things brother man said but listen he said don't you don't you ever let the devil reason you out of that he said see that backpack is necessary see in that that same thing the holy ghost is necessary and he said listen that devil to try to reason you out of that and he'll say it's not necessary he said but if god says it's necessary if we've got to cry and boohoo and do all of this if god said the baptism of the holy ghost is necessary i don't care how heavy it is it don't matter how much of the world you have to give up you're going to have to use it one of these days the only way of survival amen you you hear me the holy ghost is not only necessary amen there will come a time it's your only way of survival it's the baptism of the holy ghost and we've got we've got so-called preachers today that don't even believe in the baptism of the holy ghost you can mention the holy ghost and they'll get blushed in the face and call you a pentecostal but listen let me tell you if god said we need the holy ghost amen you'll have to have it to survive amen that's why when we're in the middle of this pandemic that there's some people amen that can't keep the pace hey man they seem like they're getting colder and colder but really what they need is a good baptism of the holy ghost amen to let their life come into line with the word of god listen to me brethren the prophet of god said this he said them brethren he said then brethren they come out on the day of pentecost he said they were convinced we needed it he said they were convinced that's all the people needed now it wasn't only necessary brother brahm said the early disciples decided that was the only thing you actually needed was the holy ghost because a prophet brought that in line he said when you receive the holy ghost everything you have need of is actually already in you he said actually the rapture is already in you listen church amen we don't have to have a storehouse of 100 things to go if we've got the holy ghost it's what's necessary to get us where we're going it's becoming very unpopular to preach on the holy ghost these days hey man but it's still necessary come on now that can you oh god i'm gonna preach it okay if i preach hey man look what's happening around here hey man we we're getting us a bunch of cowards around this message they're literally turning yellow on us they run it at the whim of every little problem and every situation they just take off like a coward hey man you know what they're doing now they're telling our pastors they are to sit down and just play a tape you ain't supposed to preach anymore amen you know what i think it is i think they're cowards i don't think they have the strength to stand in a pulpit and preach the message but they'll put brother branham out in the front and let him say it let him stand it well listen this is one preacher i want to put my voice with the voice of a prophet i don't want brother branham just to have to stand alone i don't want to put him out there by himself hey but i want to stand where a prophet stood i want to go the way a true prophet goes and stand right where he stood i don't want to die coward if i die let me die with a sword in my hand let me die fighting amen let me let me have the way of the apostles of god they cut their heads off and they boiled them and they hung them on crosses but they never defeated them they never defeated them you can kill me but you can't defeat me [Applause] oh you said preacher what are you saying i'm saying there's a faith that comes in the church of the living god and i'll master every circumstance there's a faith real faith a perfect faith he'll master every circumstance you say preacher i know some circumstances but the book of john said faith is that that overcometh the world and brother ben said you say well he didn't know what i was going through brother bam said that's why i said the world he said everything was included in that faith is the victory that overcomes everything it'll overcome every situation it'll overcome everything that you're going to meet he says he's the faith amen that'll master every circumstance now you've got to think about this because there's going to be some points it didn't look like you mastered amen listen apostle paul amen was the faith champion in hebrews 11 chapter go read that chapter go read it one time but don't stop until you get to the end and you see some of them faithful with saul asunder and some of them was burnt and fed the lines but they were every one masters they mean listen paul was sitting there with his head on a chopping block and he looked in the face of death and said death where's your stream and grave where's your victory i've already got the oh you'll never you'll never kill a saint no sir amen amen he that liveth and believeth to me shall never die so preach what are you saying i'm saying there's a faith that can move into your heart tonight move you out of any circumstances any search you know what i'm saying you can't just float around in the church though brother man said a man come to this door i wanted food he said where are you from he said no where were you going nowhere bubba said see he was just floating around he said we don't want to become floaters in the church we don't just want to float along with it do we he said what you needs a purpose he said in other words you need to get a promise and focus your life on that promise if god said we can have the holy ghost and you don't have the holy ghost put that in your focus and stay there till you get it [Applause] now watch this brother bam uses this and how can i overcome and he goes into a couple different messages but he uses this uh chronology and our example and it was good for me as i grew up on a river and he said go down to river and he said watch in the corners river and he said you see all them log piles he said see that wood what it does is it's just floating along he said in every time it comes to a corner it just hangs up do you see what it is if you're just floating along there's going to be a place you're just going to hang up and you can't go no further there's scrap heaps in every corner of a church amen there's there's turns that happen in the churches they've been changes and situations and there's there's a family that wasn't that wasn't after nothing they were just floating along and they're on the side amen all across the planet there's people with their feelings hurt sitting at home tonight amen upset at the pastor upset at somebody else upset it something else you know why they're home because they were just floating along and they had no they had no view they had no vision they had nothing they was after because if they had been after something you couldn't have run them off with a team of mules if you get somebody that wants something you can't make them get away from you come on church y'all know what i'm saying there was a little woman went to jesus and he called her a dog and she said well even the dogs get the crumbs from the master's table amen if you ever get to a place you want something from god can't nobody run you off can't nobody be mean enough to you to run you off you know what it is brother graham said that same piece of wood that hangs up in the corner he said if it ever gets in the hands of the master it becomes a boat and he said that boat needs a power on it and he said that power is the holy ghost and if you've ever been on a river it's necessary to have a motor if you want to get around the corners get your motor one time and you know what will happen when you get to them little shallow spots you ever been on a river you get them little shallow spots or gravel or sand hey man you get them little spots and you can't see them till you get there and you feel them they'll just snug the bottom of your boat and if you don't have a motor you'll hang up and have to get out and drag your boat right there but if you've got your little motor on there you can hit the motor about right there and you'll just power through it and let me tell you something tonight this bride is a masterpiece and she's being powered amen by the presence of the almighty god there's something here tonight when we hit a shallow spot we ought to just power right through it i don't believe we have to stand still or get out of the boat i believe all we got to do is use what god gave us to power through this thing tonight he said well i've come up to the hard places of my life well use that motor he gave you pull the pull the throttle back and and move into the presence of god there's a presence here tonight that'll move you you say my hey man you're awful positive about this well i got some examples i got some examples brother ma'am said jesus is the prime example when he was in his weakest condition and satan was in his strongest he stood on the word and he said it is written amen because the word is sure brother braham said he said see see amen i don't know what he's going to do but he will do it amen do you see in in in the book of kings when elijah was in a horrible shape it was there that god told elijah to go down by the brook cherith and he said i have commanded the ravens to feed you there now the brother brother brahm said it like this i have commanded the ravens he said that wasn't a hope so i think so or maybe so he said but elijah was going to get fed at that brook amen elijah had said the man said those ravens couldn't go kill a beef and pack them he said and he had no clue how god was going to do it but god said he was going to do it he had already commanded the ravens before elijah ever got there and you see what he said brother ram said the same way he said god has commanded his spirit unto all men he meant you see if god has already commanded it amen then then it's not a matter of whether god will give it or matter of will god wants to give it god has already given his spirit 2 000 years ago he poured his spirit out upon the church and is just as real tonight as it was 2 000 years ago [Applause] my goodness he commanded his spirit unto all men he commanded his blessings and he's ascended on hind gave guests unto men how's it going to come i don't know i don't know how it's going to come but this promise is unto you and them that are far off even as many as the lord our god shall call acts the second chapter and the second chapter in the 38th verse apostle peter told us if we would repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ we shall then now that's not a question that's a shall receive the holy ghost you know i was just preaching preaching on this back home a month so ago the lord being given to me and we had nine young people in a set of four meetings that got the baptism of the holy ghost one of them sitting right here tonight maybe two of them i can't remember the testimony but no one of them for sure sitting right here tonight that received the holy ghost in those meetings you say preacher what are you saying i'm saying that god is give it if we'll preach it god has given if we'll believe it god has given if we'll make room for him to give the holy ghost to somebody it's a necessary thing in mark the 16th chapter do you know jesus actually said unto us that if we would go to the world and preach the gospel amen that he that believeth is baptized shall be saved and in my name they shall cast out devils and they shall speak with new tongues and they shall take up serpents and if any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover see how certain that is and they shall recover now i know we're living in an age where people don't speak in tongues anymore i know it's almost become a a taboo in the church but jesus said we'd do it do y'all know jesus died speaking in tongues do y'all know the last words of his life was speaking in tongues amen do you know it's not something to be ashamed of brother matter of fact said if you stay in prayer long enough you will do it i'm positive about that in john the 10th chapter jesus said my sheep they know my voice my sheep know my voice see how solid that is they know they won't even they won't even follow something uncertain i sure miss you up here buddy amen they won't even they won't even follow do you see what it is a sheep needs sheep food those disciples when they sing the word manifested they know that was sheep food they know that was the trumpet they started following that my sheep know it because they sing the word of god being manifested now brother branham ties directly my sheep they know my voice the real sheep now the end of this quote the real sheep don't listen for that they listen for the trumpet they listen for the positive a real sheep will listen for that positive word they'll listen to that now see jesus told peter he said now if you love me feed my sheep if you love me feed my sheep i remember years and years and years ago when i was on the field i mean 20 something years ago and i hadn't been i hadn't been going long and everybody they was asking me are you an evangelist are you apostle or you pastor you teacher i didn't know what it was i just wanted to serve the lord hey man that's all i want to do serve the lord and people got to say well you're an evangelist and i got to listen to other evangelists and i said well maybe i don't know don't sound like them but i don't know we little different i don't know they think a little it's just different i don't know what to say about it so i was in there praying one day and i was actually driving down the road i think i was down around beaufort actually south carolina and i was driving down through there and i was telling the lord how i've been a failure and what i'd done and all these things and all of a sudden i don't know if i was listening to the scripture or reading it but what but it come across this point here where peter amen had failed the lord and after the resurrection remember the lord went and hunted peter up and he asked him three times said do you love me and peter said yeah and he said do you love me he said yeah he said peter do you love me he said lord thou knowest amen you know you know i've been messed up so much i don't know what to say anymore amen but the lord looked right at him he said peter if you love me you feed my sheep and you know right in that moment brother that's when god commissioned me and he told me you feed my sheep now i'll tell you what that's what my purpose has been for the last 20 years it ain't been to build anything it ain't been to be somebody but it's been to serve the lord and serve the sheep food to the church of the living god wherever i preach i want to preach a positive message wherever i preach i want to preach something and the prophet of god said he said sheep food that they're looking for real sheep it means there's life in it if we're going to preach something there's got to be life in it and jesus said my word is life my then there's a people here tonight that will not stagger at the promises of god through unbelief they will not stagger but like their father abraham they are fully persuaded in the promises of god they are convinced and they're not ashamed to say so amen brother branham says that he said there these men were persuaded and he said the thing tonight is are you persuaded he said are you fully persuaded that he is the holy ghost are you persuaded this is the right way are you persuaded he's a healer are you persuaded he's coming again are you persuaded that he's the same yesterday today and forever are you positive this is right are you positive it's the word of god listen what he's saying jesus when he was here he told him before abraham was i am look what he was that wasn't i hope so think so maybe so i am when he went to the tomb of lazarus he said i am the resurrection and the life amen you say well preacher i mean that's jesus but but but jesus wasn't uncertain about it amen and brother adam said you don't have to be uncertain either to think tonight you don't have to sit here in confusion you don't have to live your life in confusion you can be a certain about your destination as jesus was his i'm i'm i'm not going to read them to you because of time's sake but i'm telling you i'm quoting a prophet you can be just as certain about your place and your destination as what jesus said when he said take this body and put it in the tomb and three days i'll raise it up again he said do you see how certain that was amen and the church of the living god can be just as certain tonight amen that if if i don't live for the rapture and you put me in a tomb somewhere brother you mark it down i'm going to come out of that tomb you know how i know it because the life amen that raised up jesus christ is the same life that's in my body right now i'm not going to receive that life someday in the future i already received the baptism of the holy ghost everything i need to climb out of the grave is already in me [Applause] you know what brother man said about it he said you put me in the grave he said the spirit that's in me will see that i get a new body the spirit that's in me will see i get out of the grave it'll see that i raise up do you know he said the spirit that's in you right now could go speak a world of your own and you could live on it there's nothing uncertain about this nothing uncertain you can be positive can we be that positive can we can we be that positive brother brown said it's an example i am the resurrection in life he said now watch jesus knew where he belonged in that scripture he said now if i'm the person over there in john 5 and 24 if i'm that person in john 5 24 you all know what it says listen what it says verily verily i say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from death unto life y'all want to reread that with me the first two words verily verily means positively positively it's not very very it actually means positively positively i say unto you do you see if you're that person in john 5 and 24 you can join job's words when he said i know i know my redeemer liveth you can see you say that tonight i know you don't have to sit here tonight and wonder amen where this is going to come you can actually sit here tonight and receive the baptism of the holy ghost which is the identification of who you are you can be positive that you're a child of god accepting your identification let me let me just read you what brother branham says about it he says it's a positive token when i see the token i will pass a positive token the holy spirit is our token therefore when you receive the holy ghost you pass from death unto life that's all there is to it because life is in you you can no more perish in the token brother madam will say this the holy ghost is the token that we have been pardoned the case is closed no more wearing and we're wondering if you're sitting here with the holy ghost tonight you are to be the most positive person in this world may not be positive about the politics let me be positive about the religion we don't be positive about the future of this world but we are positive where we're going we're positive what's going to happen to us that positive reality is here tonight can you stand to your feet with me i am positive this is a positive gospel this is a positive gospel when you see that token over that door it was a positive sign that there had been a death of a lamb and to think tonight that you have got a positive sign the lamb died rose again and you're sitting here with that life tonight and positive positively positively he that believeth on me think of that that god himself would come down in your humanity and testify the same thing that he did in the scripture that there's life already in the body you love him tonight that's just by our hearts would you want to be positive wouldn't you want to know for sure [Music] wouldn't you want to know beyond the doubt tonight wouldn't you wouldn't you want that to be a positive not just floating along not just coming to the church and just moving along with it it's not necessary for me to give my life and to pour it in like that listen friend tonight [Music] won't you become positive i want you to leave that negative and come right on in i wonder tonight would it be somebody here would it be somebody here so brother and pray for me tonight i want to be positive i want that god bless you god bless you that's right brother god's dealing with you now that's the truth there's a way to be positive father we bow our hearts tonight lord there's hands been lifted in this building because there's hearts that desire they desire
