[47:17] in your name amen and amen if you have
[47:21] your Bibles this evening we'd like to
[47:23] take a look over in the Book of
[47:25] Revelation chapter 1 and verse
[47:33] three Revelations chap 1 and verse three
[47:35] just one scripture here and then we're
[47:37] going to let you have your seats
[47:39] and have a little bit of a lengthy
[47:41] scripture reading but I don't want to I
[47:43] don't want to keep you standing too long
[47:45] so we'll just we'll just read this one
[47:47] portion of scripture here in
[47:51] Revelations how many loves the word of
[47:54] the Lord amen amen amen the joy of the
[47:57] Lord is our strength and his word is
[48:00] what we feed
[48:02] upon amen Revelations 1 and verse3
[48:06] blessed is he that readeth and they that
[48:10] hear the words of this prophecy and keep
[48:13] those things which are written therein
[48:15] for the time is at hand the time is at
[48:19] hand may God richly bless his word you
[48:22] may be seated here tonight in the
[48:23] presence of the Lord I would like to
[48:26] take a thought tonight on on something
[48:29] that the Lord's been dealing with me on
[48:31] um ever since last last weekend and so
[48:34] I'd like to take a thought tonight and
[48:36] speak to you on the weight is over the
[48:39] weight is over brother brandham says to
[48:42] us here in the exposition of the seven
[48:45] Church ages he said the time is at hand
[48:48] reading here from Revelations 1 and 3 he
[48:50] said the time was not at hand previously
[48:53] in the wisdom and economy of God he he
[48:55] said this Mighty Revelation through
[48:57] though fully known to God could not come
[48:59] forth hitherto thus we immediately learn
[49:03] a principle the revelation of God for
[49:06] each age can come in that age only and
[49:09] at a specific time we know that that
[49:12] makes very good sense to us is that
[49:14] right we know that we can't preach
[49:16] Noah's message today is that right look
[49:19] at the history of Israel the revelation
[49:21] of God to Moses came only at a specific
[49:24] time of History and even more
[49:26] specifically it came as the people Cried
[49:29] unto God Jesus himself came at the
[49:32] fullness of time he being the complete
[49:34] revelation of the godhead and in this
[49:38] age Le Osan the revelation of God will
[49:41] come in its due time it will not falter
[49:44] neither will it be premature think on
[49:46] this and heed it well for we are in the
[49:50] end time today and we begin to think
[49:53] about these things about how that God
[49:55] has been holding all of these
[49:56] Revelations and to think that where we
[49:58] are in the church age of this layout of
[50:01] seean church age that we recognize that
[50:03] God has been waiting on you and I he's
[50:05] been waiting on this time for you and I
[50:08] to get here and recognizing that there
[50:10] is a fullness of this age and it's not
[50:12] going to go out unless there's a people
[50:15] that are going to overcome this lotan
[50:18] age so let us turn to Joshua chapter 3
[50:21] here this evening very lengthy but we'll
[50:24] just just bear with us this evening
[50:26] don't get lost don't get lost in sight
[50:28] here but the Bible says here that Joshua
[50:30] rose up early in the morning and they
[50:32] removed they removed from sham and came
[50:35] to Jordan and he and all the children of
[50:37] Israel lodged there before they passed
[50:39] over and it came to pass after 3 days
[50:42] that the officers went through the host
[50:44] and they commanded the people saying
[50:47] when you see the Ark of the Covenant of
[50:49] the Lord your God and the priest and the
[50:51] Levites bearing it then you shall remove
[50:54] from your place and go after after it
[50:56] yet there shall be a space between you
[50:58] and 2,000 cubits by measure it's about
[51:01] 3,500 ft if you study it out you'll
[51:04] you'll see that it's almost about 10
[51:06] football fields long is the distance
[51:09] that was to stay between them and the
[51:11] Ark of the Covenant it says the come not
[51:15] near unto it that you may know the way
[51:18] by which you must go for you've not
[51:20] passed by this way hitherto hitherto for
[51:24] and Joshua said un the people sanctify
[51:26] yourselves for tomorrow the Lord will do
[51:28] wonders amongst you and Joshua spake
[51:31] unto the priest saying take up the Ark
[51:33] of the Covenant and Passover before the
[51:35] people and they took up the Ark of the
[51:37] Covenant and went before the people and
[51:40] the Lord said unto Joshua this day will
[51:43] I begin to magnify thee in the sight of
[51:45] all of Israel they that they might know
[51:48] that to think that God already knew this
[51:51] and Joshua's already had conversations
[51:53] with God about this but God God is
[51:55] getting ready to show to all the
[51:57] children of Israel that that God that
[51:59] the God that was with Moses is the god
[52:02] that was with Joshua and to think that
[52:04] Joshua is Joshua is Moses's predecessor
[52:07] here you got to think about Moses's
[52:10] Ministry of all the great all the great
[52:12] Ministries and all the great Miracles
[52:13] that would happen in Moses's Ministry
[52:16] Moses is nobody that necessarily that
[52:18] that the next guy wants to follow in
[52:20] line because he he's got a great
[52:22] ministry but Joshua is the man that go
[52:25] has chosen unto him you've got to think
[52:27] that J that Moses was a man that was he
[52:30] was doing his greatest miracles in his
[52:36] 80s and you think that maybe when you
[52:38] get over 80 years old you think you're
[52:40] kind of out of the out of out of the
[52:41] system of God but Moses was doing his
[52:44] greatest and most prolific Miracles when
[52:47] he got above 80 years old so you're
[52:48] never too old for the promises of God
[52:51] but here Joshua is is commanded that God
[52:54] is going to be with them and he said
[52:56] from this day I will begin to magnify
[52:58] thee in the sight of all Israel that
[53:00] they might know that that as I was with
[53:02] Moses so I will be with thee and thou
[53:06] Thou shalt command the priest that bear
[53:08] the Ark of the Covenant saying when you
[53:10] are come to the brink of the Waters of
[53:11] the Jordan you shall stand still in
[53:13] Jordan and Joshua said unto the children
[53:16] of Israel come hither hear the words of
[53:18] the Lord your God and and Joshua said
[53:20] hereby you shall know that the Living
[53:23] God is amongst you and that he will
[53:25] without fail drive out from before you
[53:27] the Canaanites the Hittites the hivites
[53:30] the pites the jurgos sites the amorites
[53:32] the jebusites behold the Ark of the
[53:35] Covenant of the Lord of all the Earth
[53:36] passes over before you in the Jordan now
[53:39] therefore take ye 12 men of the tribes
[53:42] of Israel out of every tribe of man and
[53:44] it shall come to pass that as soon as
[53:47] the souls of the feet of the priesthood
[53:49] that bear the Ark of the Lord the Lord
[53:51] of all the Earth shall rest in the
[53:53] waters of Jordan that the Waters of
[53:56] Jordan shall be cut off from the waters
[53:58] that come down from above and they shall
[54:00] stand upon a heap and it came to pass
[54:03] that when the people removed their tents
[54:04] to pass over Jordan and the priest
[54:07] bearing the Ark of the Covenant before
[54:08] the people and as they they that bear
[54:11] the ark were come into Jordan and the
[54:13] feet of the priests that be the ark were
[54:15] dipped into the brim of the water for
[54:18] Jordan overfloweth all the Brinks all
[54:21] the banks all the time all its banks all
[54:24] the time
[54:25] of harvest so we recognize where they're
[54:27] living at they were in the they were
[54:29] living in the time of harvest that the
[54:31] waters which came down from above stood
[54:34] up Rose up as a heap very far from the
[54:36] city of a Adam that is beside zaratan
[54:40] and those that came down towards the sea
[54:42] plane even the salt sea failed and were
[54:45] cut off and the people passed over over
[54:47] right against Jericho and the priests
[54:50] that bear the Ark of the Covenant of the
[54:52] Lord stood firm on dry ground in the
[54:55] midst of the Jordan and all the
[54:57] Israelites passed over onto dry ground
[55:00] until all the people were passed over
[55:03] clean over Jordan to think that there we
[55:07] we're watching that that children that
[55:10] the children of Israel were in a time of
[55:12] transition that they were getting ready
[55:14] to leave the old lands of Egypt
[55:17] completely behind them that they were in
[55:19] a spot of translation that God was
[55:21] literally carrying them over by a
[55:24] miracle
[55:25] he was carrying them over into the
[55:28] promises of God and to think about that
[55:31] the whole Plan of Redemption to think
[55:33] about it and place it into view just for
[55:35] a moment it's a very powerful and it's a
[55:38] very beautiful thing when you begin to
[55:40] put the whole Plan of Redemption as we
[55:42] see here you begin to reflect upon this
[55:44] and you think about that this has been
[55:47] waited for for so long that this this
[55:50] promise that was given unto Abraham was
[55:52] promised unto him when he was in a
[55:54] Strange Land he he was he was coming out
[55:57] he was coming out from things that he
[55:59] that he grew up knowing but to think
[56:01] that this promise had been waiting until
[56:04] the children of Israel had got to their
[56:06] full position in their inheritance you
[56:09] think about the things that happened
[56:11] ever since the time that God made that
[56:14] promise unto Abraham that from that time
[56:17] Abraham had met MDC from that time
[56:20] Abraham actually lied to a king and you
[56:22] watch as Isaac actually falls into the
[56:25] same cycle because he didn't break it he
[56:27] fell into the same cycle and did the
[56:29] same exact thing with his wife from that
[56:32] time that God made a promise unto
[56:34] Abraham there you find that Jacob he
[56:36] lied he was a he was a robber he was a
[56:38] cheater he was a Shyer but yet you find
[56:41] that in those same times that in all of
[56:43] those times that it was a time that
[56:45] Jacob actually be to wrestle with the
[56:48] angel of the Lord and to think from that
[56:50] time until Jacob is wrestling with the
[56:53] angel of the Lord It's been 220 years
[56:56] since the promise has been made from
[56:58] that time that Abraham has given that
[57:00] promise Joseph that is known as a man
[57:03] that is a prophet as a Seer he has he
[57:06] has dreams he has visions and he's and
[57:08] he's raised up and he sees a vision of
[57:10] of him raised up before his brothers
[57:12] then notice that Joseph goes from the
[57:15] pit to the very vice president of Egypt
[57:18] to think that God has all of this in the
[57:21] part of his mind that God is going to
[57:23] bring about something
[57:25] that is going to do a part in his
[57:27] Redemptive plants to think that that
[57:30] Joseph was a man was a man that was
[57:33] exactly almost exactly like Christ but
[57:37] he he moved and saved an entire nation
[57:40] by the leadership of the Lord during
[57:42] that time all throughout that time Moses
[57:45] Moses is raised right there in Pharaoh's
[57:47] house he goes outside of Pharaoh's house
[57:51] goes on the backside of a desert meets a
[57:53] pillar of fire and be became the
[57:55] deliverer that is going to lead the
[57:57] children of Israel right out so from the
[57:59] time that Abraham has given this promise
[58:02] until this day that they're getting
[58:04] ready to walk into walk into their
[58:06] promise it's been over 600
[58:09] years it's been over 600 years from the
[58:13] time that it was spoken to the time that
[58:15] it was getting ready to be fulfilled I
[58:17] don't know that sometimes that we miss
[58:20] what is really happening or what is
[58:22] going on but I would say that that
[58:24] reality
[58:25] was setting in to them as soon as they
[58:27] stepped into the waters that day that
[58:30] the things that that that had laid out
[58:32] there in front of them in the promised
[58:34] land that I'd have to say that they
[58:36] would have to recognize when they were
[58:38] watching this miracle they would have to
[58:40] say we're in a moment we're in a moment
[58:44] we've never seen anything like this
[58:45] before we've never noticed anything like
[58:48] this before because you've got to think
[58:50] about this aspect of it all the old
[58:52] Fighters have done gone all the old
[58:54] gener generation has done gone away and
[58:56] they ain't never seen anything quite
[58:58] like this but they were in a moment
[59:01] because we don't completely do away with
[59:03] our Traditions is that right we don't
[59:05] completely do away with our Traditions
[59:07] there was stories about God doing those
[59:09] things there was stories about God
[59:12] parting the Red Sea but they were
[59:14] getting ready to witness the god that
[59:16] made the promise to
[59:19] Abraham you ever been in one of those
[59:21] spots where it's it's you know that God
[59:24] is said something to you and you know
[59:26] that God has promised you something and
[59:28] all of a sudden you're right in the
[59:30] middle of it and you're right in the
[59:32] middle of the vision you're right and
[59:34] all of a sudden reality starts setting
[59:36] in brother bam said that when God when
[59:39] God speaks anything he forces it to its
[59:42] place he literally forces it to its
[59:45] place you think that when Daniel was
[59:47] raised up in the time of Babylon to
[59:50] think that he was only there with only
[59:52] three other believers but God had raised
[59:54] Daniel up into such a spot that he was
[59:57] going to raise him up to be a witness to
[1:00:00] be a witness and God literally forced
[1:00:03] Daniel to the spot that I'm not going to
[1:00:05] allow some man to make some image of you
[1:00:08] and make some man-made worship but God
[1:00:11] literally pushed Daniel to a spot he was
[1:00:14] waiting at that spot to see what Daniel
[1:00:17] was going to do about it because
[1:00:19] everybody was asking for man worship but
[1:00:23] Daniel Daniel refused man worship and he
[1:00:28] literally got into such a time he was
[1:00:31] waiting God was waiting on Daniel to get
[1:00:34] to a spot and Daniel recognized he was
[1:00:36] in a
[1:00:38] moment he recognized he was in a moment
[1:00:41] and he literally throw up the windows
[1:00:43] like he' done every single day before
[1:00:45] Daniel was in that moment but God
[1:00:48] protected his Prophet all throughout
[1:00:50] those years of Babylon he was God to him
[1:00:53] before and he was going to be God to him
[1:00:56] after so Daniel was able to
[1:00:59] worship when men did not want him
[1:01:02] worshiping because God was his
[1:01:05] protector but God literally forced
[1:01:08] Daniel into this
[1:01:10] position now we know that throughout the
[1:01:13] Bible that God has always had Junctions
[1:01:16] that there's always Junctions in time
[1:01:18] that literally what it is it's a
[1:01:20] crossover that's what a junction is it's
[1:01:23] a change over in the road it's a it's a
[1:01:25] blending of rows that come together that
[1:01:28] they had been waiting since the time of
[1:01:30] Abraham but now the vision is literally
[1:01:33] being crossed over that they're in a
[1:01:36] blending of of Dimensions or a blending
[1:01:39] of Junctions that they were coming to a
[1:01:41] spot and I want to I just want to make
[1:01:43] this precedent here tonight don't fail
[1:01:45] to recognize where we are as the Church
[1:01:47] of the Living God don't fail to
[1:01:49] recognize who you are as a church or as
[1:01:52] a as a son and daughter of God don't
[1:01:54] fail to recognize what God has deposited
[1:01:58] what God has given what God has allowed
[1:02:00] you to see because you see they had been
[1:02:02] waiting on it for so long and when they
[1:02:05] were in the moment when they were in the
[1:02:07] moment that's where unbelievers Miss
[1:02:09] what's happening but real Believers
[1:02:12] recognize when they're in that moment
[1:02:14] you've waited for so long you've asked
[1:02:17] for it for so long they waited for the
[1:02:19] Messiah but the Bible said in John 1:45
[1:02:23] that when Phillip found the anel said we
[1:02:25] have found him the ones the prophets had
[1:02:28] talked about the ones that everybody
[1:02:30] Moses talked about we found him we found
[1:02:33] him and he turns around he turns around
[1:02:37] and looks onto him and said before
[1:02:39] Phillip called you I saw you sitting
[1:02:41] underneath your fig tree I saw you
[1:02:43] sitting there it's amazing thing to know
[1:02:46] to recognize that you can find yourself
[1:02:49] at the same time that God finds
[1:02:53] you
[1:02:55] I'm going to shout by myself and preach
[1:02:57] by myself tonight but it's an amazing
[1:02:59] thing to know that you can find yourself
[1:03:02] and find the Messiah at the very same
[1:03:05] time I was one way I was on a road I was
[1:03:09] sitting underneath a tree and I thought
[1:03:12] that God had left me and I thought that
[1:03:14] God had failed me but he found
[1:03:21] me he found me where I was
[1:03:25] he ain't leaving you where you're
[1:03:27] sitting
[1:03:28] at he ain't leaving you in your failures
[1:03:31] he ain't leaving you sitting out there
[1:03:33] depending on a drug by a needle he's not
[1:03:35] leaving you out there depending upon
[1:03:37] yourself he's not leaving you out there
[1:03:40] wondering if you're going to make it or
[1:03:42] not come on somebody if they had only
[1:03:45] found the Messiah and the Messiah left
[1:03:47] them the way they were he was not worth
[1:03:49] following but they found
[1:03:52] something they found something that
[1:03:55] prophecy had locked itself into this
[1:03:57] little woman by the name of Mary and It
[1:04:00] produced Jesus and they found something
[1:04:02] in Jesus that they'd been looking for
[1:04:06] let me tell you something there was
[1:04:08] something locked up on the inside of the
[1:04:10] body of Jesus Christ this bride that
[1:04:12] she'd been looking
[1:04:16] for and she found him she found him just
[1:04:19] like it says in this day in Luke 17 and3
[1:04:22] that in the days that in the last days
[1:04:25] of the son of man it shall be thus as it
[1:04:28] is in the days of the revealing of the
[1:04:31] son of man we know where we are we know
[1:04:35] where we're standing at let me tell you
[1:04:37] something let me tell you Wesley could
[1:04:39] have never fulfilled that because it
[1:04:41] wasn't his portion Luther could have
[1:04:43] never fulfilled that because it wasn't
[1:04:45] his portion because they were not at
[1:04:47] that spot of their Journey they were not
[1:04:51] there but they were waiting for it they
[1:04:54] were waiting for it they were waiting
[1:04:58] for somebody to release the seals let me
[1:05:00] say that when Paul was standing there
[1:05:03] and he was preaching to the First
[1:05:04] Corinthians church and speaking to the
[1:05:06] Thessalonian church he literally locked
[1:05:09] up the prophecies for this hour so God
[1:05:13] has spoke in Amos chapter 3 that surely
[1:05:15] Our God will do nothing unless he
[1:05:17] reveals it to the prophets so Paul
[1:05:20] literally locked up or he held those cab
[1:05:23] he held those truth there so we know
[1:05:25] that it's got to take a profit to go in
[1:05:28] there and unlock those things those
[1:05:30] Hidden Truths it would take a
[1:05:32] [Music]
[1:05:34] prophet Luther was looking for it but he
[1:05:37] died out and they they denominational
[1:05:39] lied his church Wesley looked for it but
[1:05:42] he died and they reformed his church
[1:05:44] Pentecost looked for it and they
[1:05:46] denominated and they built a box around
[1:05:50] it but God found a lady God found found
[1:05:54] a lady and I want to announce to you as
[1:05:57] Heaven has announced it the wait is over
[1:06:00] the message is here the seals have been
[1:06:03] released thus shall it be in the days of
[1:06:05] the revealing of the son of
[1:06:08] [Applause]
[1:06:12] man it was news it was news in the 60s
[1:06:18] 65 70 early ' 80s that God sent a
[1:06:22] prophet there're still some that don't
[1:06:24] recognize that God has sent a prophet
[1:06:26] but if they're predestinated to it
[1:06:28] they'll come to it but I don't have to
[1:06:30] stand here and preach to you that God
[1:06:32] sent a prophet God sent a prophet God
[1:06:34] sent a prophet the message has produced
[1:06:37] more than God sent a prophet the message
[1:06:40] has produced that you are an offspring
[1:06:43] of almighty
[1:06:44] God we know where we are we know exactly
[1:06:48] where we're standing at we're in a time
[1:06:50] of transition let me tell you this whole
[1:06:52] world is not my home
[1:06:54] I'm not happy here I enjoy the presence
[1:06:57] of the Lord I enjoy worshiping him I
[1:07:00] enjoy feeling his presence but I get so
[1:07:02] sick and tired of leaving
[1:07:04] it I get so sick and tired of coming
[1:07:07] back down to myself and the anointing
[1:07:10] rolling off we're just humans we can't
[1:07:13] handle it no more but one of these
[1:07:15] mornings between the hours of 6 and N
[1:07:18] God is going to say the wait is
[1:07:22] over
[1:07:28] let me
[1:07:29] say that all the six ages had looked for
[1:07:32] it they' look for it but they died they
[1:07:36] looked for it but they died but the
[1:07:38] seventh one which is Enoch that one was
[1:07:41] translated he was caught up let me tell
[1:07:44] you Enoch means dedicated and Enoch was
[1:07:47] dedicated to his walk he walked whether
[1:07:50] people criticized him or
[1:07:52] not
[1:07:54] but he had found such a spot where he
[1:07:56] was walking with King theoy that he
[1:07:59] would walk with him he would talk with
[1:08:02] him and God found so much favor in Enoch
[1:08:05] that he could not leave him there I'll
[1:08:07] say that God has found such favor in the
[1:08:10] Church of the Living God that he's going
[1:08:12] to translate you just like he translated
[1:08:15] Enoch but it won't be just one man it
[1:08:18] won't be just William brandom it won't
[1:08:20] just be Tim puit it won't just be Ron
[1:08:23] Spencer it'll be a universal
[1:08:29] body and when we get there brother
[1:08:32] Chris when we get in that moment that
[1:08:35] we've longed for that we beli for when
[1:08:38] we look over there and we see our loved
[1:08:42] ones the wait is
[1:08:44] over the weit is
[1:08:50] over
[1:08:52] Hallelujah the Bible said in Revelations
[1:08:55] 10: 6 and I and swear by him that liveth
[1:08:58] forever and ever who created heaven and
[1:09:01] the things therein and the earth and the
[1:09:03] things therein are and the Sea and the
[1:09:05] things which are therein that there
[1:09:07] should be time no longer so what is God
[1:09:10] saying unto us that the days of holding
[1:09:14] back of all the Mysteries are
[1:09:17] over we waited for this it's not that
[1:09:20] time shall be no more there's coming an
[1:09:22] end of time but but this is the hour of
[1:09:25] the mighty Angel Christ standing up
[1:09:28] there has been been many
[1:09:52] descendingsort days of holding back are
[1:09:55] over the days of a body without
[1:09:58] Authority are over the days of Miracles
[1:10:01] are not over but the days of saying that
[1:10:04] Miracles are over that day is
[1:10:10] over I could give testimony after
[1:10:12] testimony to anybody that wants to say
[1:10:15] the days of Miracles are passed and
[1:10:17] those days are over just let me take you
[1:10:19] back one weekend and I can show you
[1:10:21] Miracle after miracle
[1:10:24] Miracle but I want to say and announce
[1:10:27] to you that God ain't done
[1:10:29] [Applause]
[1:10:34] yet what is it it's exactly in line with
[1:10:38] Ezekiel is exactly in line with Ezekiel
[1:10:41] chapter 3 when God speaks to the prophet
[1:10:44] and tells him go out there and eat the
[1:10:45] scroll eat the scroll and go out there
[1:10:49] and prophesy to the house of Israel what
[1:10:52] was it that the prophet and the scroll
[1:10:55] had became one let me say this to you
[1:10:58] that Christ and God were one but God now
[1:11:00] has a body God now has a body that he
[1:11:04] can lay his head down on it not he's now
[1:11:06] got a body that he can fully trust and
[1:11:09] now she has ate this word she's fed on
[1:11:12] this word it ain't just books and tapes
[1:11:15] to her it ain't just pictures to her
[1:11:17] she's ate this word she's became this
[1:11:20] word she's ate it what is it we are
[1:11:23] living right here in the hour of the
[1:11:26] third pole Ministry that when he shall
[1:11:28] begin to sound forth his ministry or the
[1:11:31] mystery that the days of God shall be
[1:11:35] finished we are living right here in the
[1:11:38] hour of the third pool there was a lot
[1:11:40] of people that connected themselves to
[1:11:43] Jesus his first Ministry of Healing The
[1:11:45] Sick they were happy to stand there when
[1:11:48] he was standing there and he would raise
[1:11:50] he would raise the dead but when Jesus
[1:11:52] would stand there and said I am my
[1:11:55] father are one that's something
[1:11:58] different they didn't want no part with
[1:12:00] that they crucified him over it that's
[1:12:03] why that this generation is crucifying
[1:12:05] Christ again is because God has now
[1:12:08] found a
[1:12:10] body that God is saying the weight is
[1:12:12] over I have found her she is a virtuous
[1:12:15] wife she is a clean woman she is pure
[1:12:19] she is
[1:12:21] spotless it was not at the beginning of
[1:12:23] Ministry of the first and second pole
[1:12:25] but it was at the third pole that when
[1:12:28] Jesus begin to say those things that
[1:12:30] there begin to be a
[1:12:32] separation that's what Jesus was living
[1:12:38] for to whom will we go Lord there going
[1:12:41] to be people that walk away from you
[1:12:44] there's going to be people that walk
[1:12:45] away from maybe this ministry but
[1:12:47] they're not walking away from me and
[1:12:50] they're not walking away from you
[1:12:52] they're walking away from King
[1:12:59] Jesus God's got a body he's happy with
[1:13:03] her he loves her he can commune with her
[1:13:07] he's speaking to her she recognizes who
[1:13:10] she is in
[1:13:11] him you see it's like Ezekiel Dry Bones
[1:13:14] over there in Ezekiel 27:37 I believe
[1:13:17] you'll find that Ezekiel was standing
[1:13:20] right there and God begins to speak to
[1:13:22] him said Can these live again and
[1:13:25] Ezekiel starts talking back to him said
[1:13:27] thou knowest
[1:13:28] Lord he said then prophesy to it
[1:13:31] prophesy to it and there he begin to
[1:13:34] prophesy over those dry bones and skin
[1:13:36] and senu and flesh begin to come upon
[1:13:38] them but there's still nothing there you
[1:13:42] see that's why William Brandon would say
[1:13:44] in the church age book that a Beed
[1:13:46] corpse is nothing but a corpse you can
[1:13:49] dress it up you can dll it up you can
[1:13:53] paint PT it up but it's still a
[1:13:55] corpse that's why you can paint all
[1:13:57] these churches around here forgive me
[1:14:00] Lord Jesus forgive me little people down
[1:14:02] here but you can D all these
[1:14:04] denominations up but without Christ in
[1:14:07] them they're nothing but a
[1:14:10] [Music]
[1:14:11] corpse it can look the part it can have
[1:14:14] the body features of the part what
[1:14:16] you're looking at is mechanics without
[1:14:18] Dynamics but there came a prophecy
[1:14:21] prophesy to the wind son of
[1:14:24] man what happened and he breathed the
[1:14:27] very Breath of Life what is it William
[1:14:30] Brandon would say it in this day he said
[1:14:32] that it'll be that Pentecostal fire
[1:14:35] that'll Rapture her up I know there's a
[1:14:38] lot of people that's ashamed of
[1:14:39] Pentecostal fire but I'm not ashamed of
[1:14:41] it because a prophet said that it would
[1:14:44] be Pentecostal fire that would Rapture
[1:14:47] her
[1:14:50] up what was it it was in its position
[1:14:53] it was standing it had all the muscles
[1:14:56] it looked the part but it didn't have no
[1:14:59] life let me tell you young people if
[1:15:01] you've not been born again you're the
[1:15:03] same way that ezekiel's dry bones were
[1:15:06] without breath but let the wind of the
[1:15:08] Holy Ghost come breathe over your life
[1:15:12] wash away your sin Purge your life be
[1:15:15] born a new who can tell where the wind
[1:15:18] comes from and where the winds goes it's
[1:15:20] like the spirit of almighty God
[1:15:25] he might deal with you in this service
[1:15:27] but he might deal with you in your car
[1:15:29] I'm not putting God in a box I'm not
[1:15:31] saying that God's got to do it this way
[1:15:33] but I will say that where the spirit is
[1:15:36] there will the Eagles be
[1:15:41] gathered
[1:15:43] hallelujah hallelujah notice a during
[1:15:47] this is powerful that during the 40
[1:15:50] Years of wandering in the desert they're
[1:15:52] entering into to the promised
[1:15:54] land with a deep
[1:15:57] yearning within their souls this new
[1:16:00] generation that God's raising up and day
[1:16:03] after day they've dreamed about
[1:16:06] this they've dreamed about New Life in
[1:16:08] the promised
[1:16:10] land they've dreamed about it thought
[1:16:13] about it what's it going to be
[1:16:16] like how's it going to how's
[1:16:18] the how's the grapes going to taste over
[1:16:21] there if we've tasted it on this
[1:16:24] side what's it going to be like over
[1:16:27] there they dreamed about it they thought
[1:16:29] about it they they prayed about it
[1:16:31] they've asked they've
[1:16:33] waited now they're coming into it all
[1:16:37] them days and years of wandering
[1:16:39] watching the old Fighters die off it
[1:16:42] begin to be begin more of a reality the
[1:16:45] push to get in was real they weren't
[1:16:49] playing Church no more they weren't
[1:16:50] standing back and wondering am I it or
[1:16:52] not let me say this to you when Paul
[1:16:55] would say that we are now seated in
[1:16:57] Heavenly places that's a believer's
[1:16:59] position in Christ Jesus your days of
[1:17:01] wanding are
[1:17:03] over of sitting there and saying am I a
[1:17:05] Son of God or am I a daughter of God do
[1:17:07] I have the Holy Ghost is healing for me
[1:17:10] is Deliverance for me let me say when

[1:17:47] not working anymore how can it do it I
[1:17:49] might be a crazy man but I believe this
[1:17:52] message

[1:17:58] William brandom can't do the same thing
[1:18:01] when I watch him in my life you can't
[1:18:05] tell me I've ain't been born you can't

[1:19:25] him days are over him Days Are
[1:19:33] Over the days of wondering if he's the
[1:19:35] same yesterday today and forever it's
[1:19:38] over that's why Georgie Carter had been
[1:19:41] sitting there for nine years in this
[1:19:44] condition but when she heard about a man
[1:19:46] named William brand and she read a book
[1:19:49] that God was doing the same thing that
[1:19:50] he did back there in the days of the
[1:19:52] Bible she said my days are
[1:19:56] waiting
[1:19:58] over it's
[1:20:00] over come on Georgie it's time you get
[1:20:03] up out of your bed rise up out of your
[1:20:06] bed start leaping for Joy start bringing
[1:20:09] back a
[1:20:17] worship
[1:20:21] Hallelujah what it Israelites were
[1:20:25] getting ready to move into their full
[1:20:29] benefits because they got a land out
[1:20:31] there that has to be
[1:20:33] inherited they had to dispossess to
[1:20:39] inherit let me bring you into this
[1:20:42] picture just for a
[1:20:44] minute they've been camping and
[1:20:46] them for three days they're right there
[1:20:49] on the banks of the Jordan they're
[1:20:51] having a camping party and they're
[1:20:53] watching one of the greatest floods that
[1:20:56] the Jordan Valley has ever
[1:21:00] seen that's a paradox to me how them two
[1:21:04] spies got over there one chapter
[1:21:07] before as a paradox that's left up to
[1:21:11] God but you think about this they've
[1:21:13] been camping down there by this Jordan
[1:21:16] and we know that Jordan it means death
[1:21:18] is that right Jordan is a sign of death
[1:21:22] but this is this this place of Jordan
[1:21:24] it's it's a very prominent location in
[1:21:26] the Scriptures it was here that non
[1:21:29] dipped in the water and he was healed of
[1:21:32] leprosy it was here that Elijah was
[1:21:34] standing out there and he began to make
[1:21:37] made an axe Head Start begin floating
[1:21:39] out there in that water it was here at
[1:21:41] the Jordan rivers that Elijah and Elisha
[1:21:43] walked over on dry ground because they
[1:21:46] smoked the waters and they walked over
[1:21:48] the Jordan River going and coming so
[1:21:52] he's a god that can come through and
[1:21:54] he's a God that can get you
[1:21:56] through but it was at this spot that
[1:21:59] John the Baptist buils his builds his
[1:22:01] ministry right here on the banks of the
[1:22:02] Jordan River John the Baptist cave is
[1:22:05] just right Beyond this this Bank of
[1:22:08] Jordan it was at this spot that John is
[1:22:11] standing there and he says Behold the
[1:22:14] Lamb of God that takes away the sins of
[1:22:17] the world it was at this spot this
[1:22:19] position this place this heavenly spot
[1:22:24] that Jesus starts his
[1:22:27] ministry it's at this
[1:22:29] spot notice that that's where he started
[1:22:33] at but notice when Christ came he was
[1:22:36] the Seed of Abraham but he wasn't no not
[1:22:39] necessarily that in his body but he was
[1:22:41] that of faith of Abraham he wasn't that
[1:22:43] of he wasn't that of Abraham's body but
[1:22:45] he was that of Abraham's faith that he
[1:22:48] that he believed the word of God no
[1:22:50] matter what I think amaz amazing tonight
[1:22:53] that that Paul would say unto us that
[1:22:56] you are the children of Abraham by faith
[1:23:01] that no matter how ridiculous it may
[1:23:03] seem you still believe it doesn't matter
[1:23:06] how how how how big the obstacles are
[1:23:09] you still believe no matter how
[1:23:12] ridiculous it makes you look to the
[1:23:14] outside world of waiting on a
[1:23:18] baby but when they met
[1:23:20] MDC what was the story the waiting is
[1:23:25] over but here he wasn't just Isaac but
[1:23:29] this was the royal Seed of Abraham right
[1:23:34] here in a very Junction of time we know
[1:23:37] that William Brandon would tell us he
[1:23:40] would tell us in a junction of time he
[1:23:41] said to every Junction Angels appear
[1:23:45] prophets arise Miracles are done right
[1:23:48] there right there at the junction
[1:23:51] because we Rec recognize that Miracles
[1:23:54] are happening because there is a
[1:23:56] prophetic moment that we're standing in
[1:24:00] you see brother random would also tell
[1:24:02] us that two omnipotence when they meet
[1:24:04] the miraculous has got to take place
[1:24:06] what is it it's an omnipotence of God
[1:24:08] and your faith your
[1:24:10] omnipotent
[1:24:12] Faith what is it how are you Abraham
[1:24:15] seed not by body but by faith you see
[1:24:19] faith comes by hearing of the word of
[1:24:21] God faith is never built upon sympathy
[1:24:25] faith never comes through discussing
[1:24:27] with people their pains or their aches
[1:24:29] or their weaknesses or their sicknesses
[1:24:32] but faith is born when we hear the very
[1:24:35] word of God and Jesus said You shall
[1:24:37] know the truth and the truth shall make
[1:24:39] you free and he is the truth is that
[1:24:42] right so it's our time as Sons and
[1:24:45] Daughters of God to stand right here and
[1:24:47] to declare war on every form of sickness
[1:24:51] every demon every High thing and take
[1:24:54] authority over it every form of demon
[1:24:57] power not through our bodies but through
[1:25:00] faith in the Son of
[1:25:04] God you've been camping around this and
[1:25:06] you've been looking at that trouble but
[1:25:08] I want to announce to you you've got
[1:25:10] faith to conquer the
[1:25:13] flood you've got faith to conquer the
[1:25:15] flood the old generation has done watch
[1:25:18] some miracle like this happened before
[1:25:20] but Joshua and Caleb's only one has
[1:25:22] watched it but here's a new generation a
[1:25:25] new generation that's raising up the old
[1:25:27] generation watched God part the Red Sea
[1:25:31] and walk over on dry ground but God was
[1:25:33] raising up a new generation and he was
[1:25:36] saying unto them that I'm the same
[1:25:38] yesterday today and forever that the God
[1:25:42] that was with Moses is the god that is
[1:25:45] with
[1:25:47] Joshua it's one thing it's one thing to
[1:25:51] get a couple soldiers across here go spy
[1:25:53] out the land but it's another thing to
[1:25:55] stand out there and watch a million
[1:25:57] people crossing with belongings with
[1:26:00] their Ox with their livestock and all
[1:26:02] those things they're right there in the
[1:26:04] time of harvest they're right there in
[1:26:06] that moment maybe you show those
[1:26:08] pictures for us
[1:26:12] is as you as you see here this is what
[1:26:16] you're looking at is what you're looking
[1:26:18] from above of what what Israel was
[1:26:20] getting ready to cross
[1:26:23] this is what it typically looks like
[1:26:25] it's it's Jordan Jordan what we see it
[1:26:28] we would call it a creek is what we
[1:26:31] would typically call that here but
[1:26:33] you've got to think about thousands of
[1:26:35] years ago and as man progressed they
[1:26:38] begin to learn about how they could wash
[1:26:40] the sand and get rid of the sea get rid
[1:26:42] of the salt in it so they would take
[1:26:44] Waters from it so it condensed down the
[1:26:46] size of the Jordan River and men would
[1:26:49] begin to progress it so the Jordan River
[1:26:51] What would we see now was much bigger
[1:26:54] back in the days of Joshua but when
[1:26:57] Joshua is standing there they're camping
[1:26:58] on the side of sidom and there you watch
[1:27:01] that the baptismal it's highly thought
[1:27:03] that the baptismal sight of Jesus and
[1:27:05] the crossing sight of Israel is at the
[1:27:07] same location there you can see it just
[1:27:10] right outside of gilgal there's Jericho
[1:27:12] just right past it but to think that
[1:27:15] they were in this spot in a time of
[1:27:17] harvest that when God comes down to
[1:27:19] prove himself that he's God he he not
[1:27:22] just going to stand there and just let
[1:27:24] you walk over a creek to prove that he's
[1:27:26] God but God allows major circumstances
[1:27:30] to come so that he can prove that he's
[1:27:36] God next picture if you don't
[1:27:39] mind as you see as you see here I you
[1:27:42] forgive me I ain't too much of a
[1:27:45] slideshow kind of dude but just felt
[1:27:47] this is probably the best way to show it
[1:27:49] to you so here they are they're camping
[1:27:50] up here and them and they're
[1:27:52] standing there and they're camping here
[1:27:54] for three days and they're looking
[1:27:56] there and when Joshua begins to speak to
[1:27:59] them and tells him said now look we're
[1:28:02] going to send the Ark of the Covenant
[1:28:03] out in front of you by 3,500
[1:28:06] ft the iffel tower is only about a th000
[1:28:09] ft so that the Ark of the Covenant is
[1:28:12] going about three times past what the
[1:28:15] Eiffel Tower looks at because God wanted
[1:28:18] to make sure that they didn't lose sight
[1:28:20] of the word how bad things were down
[1:28:22] there in Lea so we put it so far out
[1:28:25] there in front of them so that they
[1:28:27] could see it so they're back there
[1:28:29] camping at sh them but the Ark of the
[1:28:32] Covenant is moving on and when the
[1:28:34] priest step into the waters the waters
[1:28:38] begin to part the waters too the Dead
[1:28:41] Sea are now cut
[1:28:43] off but everything all the way up to the
[1:28:46] city of Adam begins to be put on hold
[1:28:50] and God begins to build it up
[1:28:53] he begins to build it up and it is said
[1:28:55] by the banks that the water actually
[1:28:58] crested or showed that it was 100 to 120
[1:29:01] ft standing in the
[1:29:06] air as soon as they step into it as soon
[1:29:10] as they step into it let me say this to
[1:29:12] you Church you don't have to worry when
[1:29:15] the word of God steps into your
[1:29:17] situation he will make the enemy stop
[1:29:20] where he's at
[1:29:23] all now you can imagine everybody up
[1:29:25] there zaran in the city of Adam saying
[1:29:28] what is going on down there close to
[1:29:32] gilgal and the people down at the Dead
[1:29:34] Sea said man we was having a good time
[1:29:36] fishing down here but all of a sudden
[1:29:39] the waters dried
[1:29:41] up but God literally stopped the
[1:29:45] waters made the men of God stand right
[1:29:48] there where the water was where the
[1:29:51] truck trouble was where the fear was and
[1:29:55] he made them to cross over it it's two
[1:29:59] miles two miles of water that they're
[1:30:02] walking
[1:30:05] past when you when you're in this
[1:30:08] position when you and you're in this
[1:30:10] position and you look
[1:30:14] over and there's a 100 to 120 ft of
[1:30:17] water looking at
[1:30:19] you don't tell me that he can't do it
[1:30:23] when I look over there and I see cancer
[1:30:25] bound don't tell me he can't do it when
[1:30:27] I look over there and I see tuberculosis
[1:30:29] bound don't tell me he can't do it when
[1:30:31] I look over there and I see Congressman
[1:30:33] Upshaw don't tell me he can't do
[1:30:36] it I look over there and two miles two
[1:30:39] miles of this you got two miles of
[1:30:41] testimonies you got two miles of this
[1:30:44] you don't have to worry about if God's a
[1:30:46] bridge builder or not he's still Jehovah
[1:30:50] Gyra he's the god that can provide away
[1:30:53] so if he is Jehovah Gyra he is Jehovah
[1:30:56] Rafa if he is Jehovah Rafa he's Jehovah
[1:31:00] madash that is my righteousness if he's
[1:31:03] Jehovah madash he's Jehovah tiu he's
[1:31:06] Jehovah
[1:31:09] ni hallelujah what are we looking at
[1:31:12] extreme events call for extreme beliefs
[1:31:16] but Extreme beliefs causes extreme
[1:31:20] miracles
[1:31:22] Jordan you're nothing to almighty
[1:31:30] God the Bible said in Isaiah 52 and12
[1:31:34] that for you shall not go out with haste
[1:31:35] nor go nor go by flight for the Lord
[1:31:38] will go before you and the god of Israel
[1:31:41] will be your reward so he's before you
[1:31:44] and he's behind
[1:31:47] you brother man said that when them two
[1:31:49] spies came back when when them two spies
[1:31:52] came back and they got to testifying of
[1:31:54] what Jericho thought about them what
[1:31:56] Jericho thought about how that they went
[1:31:58] down there won the battle they' heard
[1:32:00] about it and Rahab had brought up this
[1:32:02] brought up this
[1:32:04] report brother Baron said that Joshua
[1:32:07] was standing there as he's hearing these
[1:32:08] reports he's standing there and he's
[1:32:10] whirling his swirled his sword
[1:32:13] around he's standing there whirling his
[1:32:15] sword around said glory to God he's
[1:32:18] before us glory to God he's before us us
[1:32:22] so Joshua knew that the report of the
[1:32:25] Lord had already got to the
[1:32:28] enemy you might believe the report but
[1:32:32] God makes sure that your enemy is going
[1:32:34] to believe the
[1:32:39] report let me tell you there's an
[1:32:41] announcement in hell I'm losing this one

[1:41:26] them come on David come on David you
[1:41:29] done heard the sound of the Mulberry
[1:41:31] Tree you done heard the Holy Ghost why
[1:41:33] don't you go ahead and destroy the
[1:41:35] [Applause]
[1:41:41] Philistine
[1:41:43] crossover where we at where we at as a
[1:41:47] body of Jesus
[1:41:49] Christ BL barus waited for this
[1:41:53] moment but he was in Translation
[1:41:59] time brother I found this today brother
[1:42:02] BR said said that barname was sitting
[1:42:05] there he said my mama told me about the
[1:42:08] God that did those things how that just
[1:42:11] about 500 ft down there that's where
[1:42:14] Joshua was
[1:42:16] standing and he saw the angel of the
[1:42:18] Lord with the sword in his
[1:42:19] hand
[1:42:22] he said if I could have lived in that
[1:42:23] day I could have met
[1:42:26] him remember said that blind b m was
[1:42:29] sitting there on a
[1:42:31] rock said sitting there on a rock and he
[1:42:33] said you know
[1:42:35] what he said I'm sitting on this rock he
[1:42:38] said that a couple hundred years ago was
[1:42:41] sitting on the top of that wall up there
[1:42:42] in
[1:42:45] Jericho he said if he could do it then
[1:42:49] surely he can come by
[1:42:52] then all of a sudden he heard a word
[1:42:54] said Jesus of Nazareth is passing by
[1:42:57] this
[1:42:59] way and his days of
[1:43:02] blindness was
[1:43:04] over you walked in darkness for so long
[1:43:08] but now you are enlightened to the truth
[1:43:11] we're in a time of translation church
[1:43:14] that the only translation that can be
[1:43:16] done from Earth to glory is through
[1:43:18] Jesus Christ he's the only translation
[1:43:21] only way to be translated he said you
[1:43:23] can't buy it you can't work for it you
[1:43:26] got to receive it it's a gift of God
[1:43:29] God's translation is to take you now
[1:43:33] notice what the Bible said here in 1
[1:43:35] Thessalonians
[1:43:36] 4:15 for this we say unto you by the
[1:43:39] word of the Lord that we which are alive
[1:43:42] and remain until the coming of the Lord
[1:43:44] shall not prevent
[1:43:47] them shall not hinder them is what
[1:43:50] brother br said the message Rapture he
[1:43:52] said will not hinder them which are
[1:43:54] asleep for the Lord himself shall
[1:43:57] descend from heaven with a shout with
[1:43:59] the voice of the Archangel with the
[1:44:01] Trump of God and the dead in Christ
[1:44:02] shall rise first then we which are alive
[1:44:06] and remain shall be caught up together
[1:44:09] with them in the clouds to meet the Lord
[1:44:11] in the air and so shall we ever be with
[1:44:14] the Lord now the word rapture is not
[1:44:18] even in the Bible in the English
[1:44:19] language it's not even in there but the
[1:44:22] English Language by English language we
[1:44:24] put that word rapture right there and we
[1:44:27] shall remain shall be caught up that
[1:44:30] word caught up it means to seize it
[1:44:33] means to catch away it means to pluck it
[1:44:35] means to pull or to take up by force but
[1:44:38] the word rapture is a Latin word which
[1:44:41] comes from the word Raptor which is like
[1:44:45] an eagle or an opre that begins to swoop
[1:44:48] down and begins to snatch up it begins
[1:44:52] to snatch up so notice that that this is
[1:44:57] the rapture that this catching away it's
[1:45:00] like a thief coming in the middle of the
[1:45:02] night he's not going to let anybody else
[1:45:05] know what he's doing he's not going to
[1:45:07] announce it to the
[1:45:09] neighborhood I'm coming to rob you but
[1:45:12] such as a thief in the night the Lord
[1:45:14] shall come and literally
[1:45:19] snatch like a eagle anointing come in
[1:45:22] and snatch you
[1:45:24] up let me say it to you this eag
[1:45:28] anointing has found its position in the
[1:45:31] body of Jesus Christ and it's this
[1:45:33] Vindicated
[1:45:35] message that has literally snatched you
[1:45:38] away from the devil he snatched you away
[1:45:41] spiritually from the devil when the
[1:45:43] devil tried to rob you and steal your
[1:45:45] identity he snatched you away from the
[1:45:47] devil but one of these mornings he's
[1:45:51] going to snatch you away
[1:45:55] physically Satan wants you to miss this
[1:45:59] Rapture he wants you to miss this
[1:46:01] Rapture because even while William
[1:46:03] brandham is preaching a Rapture in
[1:46:07] 1965 you hear him on tape he said
[1:46:09] there's a lady back here trying to get
[1:46:11] me to stop she's back there waving her
[1:46:13] hand what was it Satan was trying to
[1:46:16] stop a Rapture
[1:46:18] message what was it it's a woman a woman
[1:46:21] literally kicked William brandham out
[1:46:24] what is it this church this church world
[1:46:26] this Catholicism is kicking this Bri
[1:46:29] out we're not welcome here no more but
[1:46:33] so riddens
[1:46:38] goodbye this message has been Vindicated
[1:46:40] this message called my name I know
[1:46:43] there's a lot of people that say that it
[1:46:45] called him a buzzard but he called me an
[1:46:47] eagle this message is Thoroughly
[1:46:49] Vindicated and William
[1:46:53] Bram is a Vindicated
[1:47:03] Prophet but Sam you're
[1:47:07] Vindicated you're Vindicated that the
[1:47:10] god of William
[1:47:14] brandom is your god
[1:47:19] Samuel
[1:47:22] what is it it's the lord it's Christ
[1:47:24] that has descended notice brother
[1:47:26] Brandon when he comes and I I'm trying
[1:47:28] to bring us down I'm sorry if I've went
[1:47:30] too far for you my brother random said
[1:47:33] that when he descends he does all three
[1:47:37] one time Trump the
[1:47:42] shout and it becomes and he begins to
[1:47:44] come down and the voice of the Archangel
[1:47:46] and the Trump and all of it it all
[1:47:48] happens at once now notice what you see
[1:47:49] in Revelation aans chapter 10 that's not
[1:47:52] Jesus that's Christ up there that's
[1:47:54] Christ up there what is it it is his
[1:47:58] descending what is it the shout is a
[1:48:00] message the voice is the wakening up of
[1:48:03] the sleeping bride but the trumpet is
[1:48:05] the Gathering the trumpet is the rapture
[1:48:09] what is it it's the shout it's the shout
[1:48:12] that wakes up the sleeping body what is
[1:48:15] it he's descended many of times but this
[1:48:18] time he's coming and he's bringing the
[1:48:20] people with him and when he see when you
[1:48:23] go it's a signal to Israel that she's
[1:48:26] receiving her two prophets that the same
[1:48:29] Angel anointing will be on those
[1:48:32] prophets what is it it's the shout it's
[1:48:35] a shout that is a third
[1:48:37] pole the shout is the third pole it's
[1:48:40] the Vindication of the
[1:48:42] message what is it first pole didn't get
[1:48:46] you the second pole didn't get you but
[1:48:48] this third pole this vindicat ation he
[1:48:51] said we become a part of all of this
[1:48:54] before that time of rapture
[1:48:56] comes he said before the catching up of
[1:48:59] that Rapture he said we became a part of
[1:49:01] it before that time now notice brother
[1:49:04] random says some very powerful things
[1:49:06] here and how can I overcome he said now
[1:49:08] at the coming of Christ of the Lord
[1:49:10] Jesus Christ he said those who are
[1:49:12] really loving his coming that's living
[1:49:15] for it when he appears in the sky the
[1:49:17] church that's dead in Christ shall rise
[1:49:19] and those
[1:49:21] those will be changed in a moment he
[1:49:25] said the rest of them won't know nothing
[1:49:26] about it he said remember he appeared to
[1:49:29] those in the city see he said the
[1:49:31] Rapture will be like that we'll see each
[1:49:34] other and we'll see them and the rest of
[1:49:37] the world W see them it'll be cut away
[1:49:40] as a secret going he said a waiting for
[1:49:43] that
[1:49:44] time but when when God gives us when God
[1:49:49] sets us in order
[1:49:51] when God gave us the baptism of the Holy
[1:49:53] Ghost when God give us the best that he
[1:49:56] got he gave us an atomic weapon that
[1:50:00] brother brandom said that it is that
[1:50:01] Atomic weapon that will sweep us all the
[1:50:05] way from Eden right into the Rapture of
[1:50:08] the Lord that it's this message that
[1:50:12] Satan does not know what to do with that
[1:50:15] literally will sweep us will literally
[1:50:19] sweep us
[1:50:20] right into the
[1:50:23] Rapture now when William brand was up
[1:50:26] there he's up there and up he's up there
[1:50:29] in Sportsman Hollow and you can hear
[1:50:30] Brother B talk about this in my new
[1:50:32] ministry and he starts talking about
[1:50:35] there there I was he said I was up there
[1:50:37] and he said and he said I was I was up

[1:50:46] whatsoever things you ask believe that
[1:50:48] you shall receive them he said I was up
[1:50:50] there he said and all of a sudden he
[1:50:52] said a super anointing come whirling
[1:50:54] down through them
[1:50:56] trees I said what do you have need of
[1:50:59] ask and it shall be given he said it was
[1:51:01] a super anointing that comes sweeping
[1:51:03] through there he comes sweeping down
[1:51:06] through there he said there I am and I'm
[1:51:08] back there I'm back there sitting with
[1:51:11] had rod and he said I'm simply telling
[1:51:14] these things or testifying of what God
[1:51:16] did and he said all of a sudden when had
[1:51:20] he said that's nothing but the truth he
[1:51:22] said that super anointing comes sweeping
[1:51:25] through there and said the angel of the
[1:51:27] Lord said tell her that she's found
[1:51:29] favor with God Almighty said give her
[1:51:33] whatever she asked for he said it comes
[1:51:37] sweeping he said it comes sweeping
[1:51:40] through the room what was it the third

[1:52:23] literally catch us up and put us all
[1:52:25] together and you brother Rand said that

[1:58:13] there's a man here can do it you don't
[1:58:15] know how to make him believe but God can
[1:58:17] make him believe if he can take sh adch
[1:58:19] mesach and abedo and put them down there
[1:58:21] in a fiery
[1:58:23] furnace and sweep a little air into that
[1:58:26] room surely he can come sweep over your

[2:01:42] that John the Baptist was nothing but a
[2:01:45] bunch of Holy Rollers he was standing
[2:01:47] there and he put his hand on them
[2:01:50] Stones said you bunch of Generation of
[2:01:53] Vipers you refuse to believe that God's
[2:01:56] going to do a new thing he said but God
[2:01:58] is literally able to rise up children of
[2:02:01] Israel right out of these Stones I'll
[2:02:04] say this that if the rest of the world
[2:02:07] don't want to believe it God will raise
[2:02:09] up some rocks of testimony that'll
[2:02:12] believe that God is a God that can cross
[2:02:15] a red sea he's a God that can cross a
[2:02:17] Jordan River he's the god that walks in
[2:02:20] fire he's the god that kills
[2:02:23] goliaths when they want to say it's over
[2:02:27] there's a people that say the days of
[2:02:30] waiting are over and I ain't going to
[2:02:33] let no Rock testify in my
[2:02:37] place I got 12 Stones right
[2:02:40] here don't tell
[2:02:43] me don't make me make them start
[2:02:47] singing cuz they can sing sing don't
[2:02:50] make me start beating on them so that
[2:02:52] they can sing because they will testify
[2:02:55] they will testify that God still God if
[2:02:58] we could get a hold of that rock that
[2:02:59] killed Goliath that rock could testify
[2:03:02] to us couldn't he that this rock of
[2:03:05] testimony is good enough to kill a
[2:03:09] giant don't make me get them rocks out
[2:03:12] don't make me get them rocks out that
[2:03:13] them Pharisees dropped out dropped out
[2:03:16] there when they said he when Jesus said
[2:03:18] ye with without sin cast the first stone
[2:03:20] don't make me pick these rocks up don't
[2:03:23] make me pick these rocks up don't make
[2:03:25] me pick that rock up that Moses smoked
[2:03:27] and there was enough water for two
[2:03:29] million people don't make me do
[2:03:32] it but I'm afraid that too many times
[2:03:34] that people are afraid to miss a moment
[2:03:38] they're afraid to recognize where
[2:03:40] they're
[2:03:42] at and they're afraid to sing out and
[2:03:44] they're afraid to testify and they're
[2:03:45] afraid to witness that he's a God that
[2:03:48] does these things
[2:03:49] right there's
[2:03:51] literally there's literally a rock
[2:03:53] quarry in
[2:03:59] Pennsylvania that you can go up there
[2:04:02] and you can take your hammer and you can
[2:04:04] start tapping on

[2:04:10] at them things for
[2:04:12] years but you can take your hammer and
[2:04:15] you can tap on it and it'll start
[2:04:17] ringing out and they said that in
[2:04:20] certain Seasons that it's the most
[2:04:22] beautiful music that is played right out
[2:04:25] of them Stones right up there in that
[2:04:27] rock Corry it's a sign to us that
