[36:50] Yes, I can only imagine.
[36:54] [Applause]
[36:54] [Music]
[36:59] When I'm surrounded by your
[37:03] glory, what will my heart feel? Will I
[37:08] dance for you,
[37:10] Jesus? For in all of you be still. Will
[37:14] I stand in your presence? Unto my knees
[37:20] will I fall. Will I sing
[37:25] hallelujah? Will I be able to speak it
[37:28] all? I can only
[37:35] imagine. I can only
[37:43] imagine. I can only imagine.
[37:51] Yes, I can only imagine.
[38:01] [Applause]
[38:35] [Music]
[38:37] Amen. It's always an honor to be here
[38:39] with
[38:41] y'all. Y'all to sing this song with me.
[38:44] I never shall forget the day.
[38:50] Long years
[38:53] ago went out in sin.
[38:58] I had no
[39:01] hope, no peace
[39:05] within. Down on my
[39:08] [Music]
[39:09] knees in
[39:13] agony, I prayed to Jesus and he gladly
[39:18] set me free.
[39:21] [Music]
[39:22] I never
[39:25] shall forget the
[39:29] day when all the burdens of my heart got
[39:34] rolled
[39:37] away. It made me
[39:40] [Music]
[39:41] high. Be glad and free.
[39:46] I'll sing and shout it for he's
[39:50] everything to
[39:54] me now I can
[39:58] feel him by my
[40:02] side my
[40:06] fears he comes and
[40:10] guides when trials
[40:14] come he comes I'm
[40:17] [Music]
[40:18] thirsty. Through faith in him over sin I
[40:23] have the
[40:27] victory. I never
[40:31] shall forget that
[40:35] day when all the burdens of my heart got
[40:41] rolled
[40:43] away. It made me
[40:48] hand be glad and
[40:52] free. I'll sing and shout it for he
[40:57] said to
[41:00] me. Oh sinner
[41:04] come to Jesus
[41:09] now at his defeat.
[41:14] Just humbly
[41:17] bow. Confess to
[41:21] him your every
[41:25] sing. He'll save you, cleanse you, give
[41:29] you peace and joy within.
[41:35] I never
[41:38] shall forget that
[41:42] day when all the burdens of my heart got
[41:48] to roll
[41:50] [Music]
[41:51] away. It made me
[41:53] [Music]
[41:55] happy. Be glad and free.
[42:00] I'll sing and shout it for he said
[42:05] everything to me. Sing it to him again
[42:08] now. I never
[42:12] shout. Forget that
[42:16] day. When all the burdens of my heart
[42:21] got rolled away.
[42:26] made me be
[42:29] high. Be glad and
[42:33] free. I'll sing and shout it for he said
[42:38] everything to
[42:42] me. I'll sing and shout it for he said
[42:47] everything to
[42:51] me. Hallelujah.
[43:04] [Music]
[43:09] Lord, I come to you.
[43:14] Let my heart be
[43:18] changed,
[43:21] renewed, flowing from the
[43:26] grace that I
[43:31] found in you.
[43:40] Lord, I've come to
[43:44] know the weaknesses I
[43:50] see in
[43:53] me. They will be stripped
[44:01] away by the power of your love.
[44:17] me
[44:19] close. Let your love
[44:23] [Music]
[44:25] surround me.
[44:30] will

[44:47] near
[44:50] and
[44:53] highway. I'll rise up like an e
[44:58] [Music]
[45:02] Eagle and I will sow with
[45:06] you. Your spirit leads me
[45:10] on by the power of your love.
[45:20] Lord,
[45:21] unveil my
[45:24] eyes and let me see you
[45:29] face to
[45:32] face. The knowledge of your
[45:37] love as you
[45:39] [Music]
[45:41] live in me.
[45:52] Lord,
[45:53] renew my
[45:56] mind as your will
[46:01] unfold in my
[46:05] life. I'm living every
[46:11] [Music]
[46:13] day by the power of your
[46:17] [Music]
[46:24] love. Oh,
[46:29] holy ghost.
[46:32] Just let your love
[46:37] surround
[46:41] me. Oh,
[46:46] draw me
[46:49] near Lord. Draw me to your side.
[47:01] And
[47:03] as the
[47:07] highway, I'll rise up like
[47:10] [Applause]
[47:13] the
[47:16] eagle and I will sow with
[47:20] you. Your spirit leads me
[47:25] on by the power of your love.
[47:33] [Music]
[47:37] Hallelujah.
[47:38] Aren't you thankful to be drawn by the
[47:40] power of the Holy Ghost? Hallelujah.
[47:43] Won't you stand with us this evening?
[47:46] Hallelujah. What a wonderful atmosphere
[47:48] that is set in this place tonight. Amen.

[47:57] abundantly above all of our

[48:43] place tonight. Amen. We've prayed for
[48:45] these meetings. We're just expecting God
[48:47] to move. Maybe we have the key of C.
[48:50] Amen. As brother Timothy just prepares

[50:42] [Applause]
[50:45] I sing for joy at the work of your
[50:53] hands. Forever I'll love you.
[50:59] Forever I'll
[51:01] [Music]
[51:02] say. Oh, nothing
[51:05] compares to the
[51:08] promise I
[51:11] have in you.
[51:16] The lost are
[51:20] safe. They find their
[51:25] way. Oh, at the
[51:27] [Music]
[51:29] sound of your great
[51:34] name. All can
[51:40] feel no shame.

[51:48] sound of your great
[51:53] name,
[51:54] oh every
[51:57] fear, it has no
[52:03] place at
[52:08] the great name.
[52:12] [Applause]
[52:14] to
[52:16] me. He has to
[52:21] flee. Oh, at the
[52:26] sound of your great
[52:31] name is Jesus.
[52:37] [Music]
[52:51] might
[52:54] [Music]
[53:06] high. Hallelujah.
[53:09] Hallelujah.
[53:12] Amen. He has a name that's worthy to be
[53:14] praised. Amen.
[53:16] Oh, how we love him tonight. Let's just
[53:18] bow our hearts in prayer and just ask
[53:20] the Lord to come by and speak tonight.
[53:22] Father, we come to you today,
[53:25] Lord. Our hearts dependent on you, Lord
[53:28] Jesus.
[53:30] We ask, Father, that you'd come and you
[53:32] would minister and you would speak, you
[53:34] would touch, Lord, that you would come
[53:37] and open the words of life and speak to
[53:39] every heart, Lord, we pray, as only you
[53:43] can do, Lord. Lord, I no doubt if I'd
[53:46] ask for hands to be lifted about
[53:48] different needs. There'd been hands
[53:49] lifted all over this building. Lord,
[53:51] you're a great God for our needs. And we
[53:54] just ask you to come by and speak and
[53:56] touch. We pray we give this service this
[53:59] weekend to you in Jesus name.
[54:03] Amen. Amen.
[54:11] Get me all harnessed up here. Amen. Is
[54:14] that better? That sounds better. Amen.
[54:17] God bless you tonight. It's good to be
[54:18] with you. Amen. You can be dismissed.
[54:21] God bless you. Turn in your Bibles to
[54:23] Mark chapter 11 if you would. Amen.
[54:27] Amen. I want to say it's such an honor
[54:30] and privilege to be here with you and
[54:33] amen to speak to you tonight and just
[54:36] trusting something can be said to
[54:37] strengthen you and help you and amen to
[54:41] long life's journey. We I want to thank
[54:43] Sister Ruth for being with us
[54:45] today coming with us. You know, we're
[54:48] we're in phases of life that's changing.
[54:50] um almost empty neester seems like and
[54:54] and grandpa and grandma is like my
[54:56] goodness what's happening. Time just
[54:57] keeps ticking on and but it's a good
[54:59] it's a good phase to be in a yeah I'm
[55:02] enjoying it. Amen. So uh just have to
[55:06] put up with a few more aches and pains
[55:07] and things but as we get older and but
[55:10] uh also thank brother Tim and sister
[55:12] Angie and sister Allison for coming up
[55:15] and being with us this weekend. And it
[55:16] means a lot, you know, when home folks
[55:18] have traveled that far to come up and
[55:20] you're the one preaching. You know, I
[55:22] can understand brother Ron, brother
[55:23] Andrew is preaching. But Amen. It means
[55:26] a lot. Sure enjoyed those songs. Thank
[55:27] you, brother Tim. Amen. Markap 11 and
[55:31] verse
[55:32] 22. said, "And Jesus answered and said
[55:34] unto them, have faith in God. For verily
[55:38] I say unto you, that what that whosoever
[55:40] shall say unto this mountain, Be thou
[55:43] removed, and be thou cast into the sea,
[55:46] and shall not doubt in his heart, but
[55:49] shall believe that those things which he
[55:51] has said shall come to pass, he shall
[55:53] have whatsoever he saith.
[55:56] Therefore, I say unto you, what's what
[55:58] things soever you desire when you pray,
[56:02] believe that you receive them, and you
[56:04] shall have them. Amen. But he doesn't
[56:07] end it right there. He continues on. He
[56:09] says, "When you stand praying, forgive.
[56:12] If you have ought against any, that your
[56:14] father also which is in heaven may
[56:17] forgive you your trespasses. But if you
[56:20] do not forgive, neither will your father
[56:22] which is in heaven forgive your
[56:24] trespasses."
[56:26] Amen. We let you be seated this evening.
[56:28] There's a thought that uh has been on my
[56:30] heart uh for this weekend. Just like to
[56:34] speak to you on faith that's based on
[56:37] forgiveness.
[56:38] Faith is based on forgiveness. Brother
[56:40] Brandham actually makes this statement
[56:42] in perfect faith. He said faith is based
[56:45] on forgiveness. He said as we said this
[56:48] morning, he preached that morning on how
[56:50] can I overcome? He says, "Trying to get
[56:52] I'm trying to get the church into a
[56:54] place to where we can really see
[56:56] apostolic times moving among us." That's
[56:59] what we all hunger for, but it's just
[57:02] laying right at the door. We see it, but
[57:05] we want more of it. How many wants more
[57:07] of it? Amen. We've seen miracles, but I
[57:10] I want them. I want more miracles. I
[57:12] I've seen healings. I've seen
[57:13] deliverances. I've seen baptisms. I I've
[57:16] seen all of these things, but I want
[57:17] more of it. We want such a flow that
[57:20] it'll help us. and flow out to others.
[57:22] Amen. But he made I thought that was a
[57:24] powerful statement that he would say
[57:26] it's based on forgiveness and and Jesus
[57:28] used this in the scripture. He began to
[57:30] speak about how that you say to your
[57:32] mountain. We we love that scripture and
[57:34] we quote it a lot and we want the power
[57:36] of spoken word. But that power is
[57:39] hinging on something is hinging on Amen.
[57:41] the forgiveness that you have in your
[57:43] heart for others. Amen. Things that
[57:45] sometimes we allow to lay there and we
[57:47] allow to fester and we we'll get into
[57:49] that. But God wants all of that out of
[57:52] our heart so then he can truly come down
[57:54] and use our vessel. Amen. Amen. This is
[57:57] what he would say in Matthew chapter 18
[57:59] and verse 15 as we go through a few
[58:01] scriptures to kind of lay a foundation.
[58:03] Said, "Moreover, if thy brother shall
[58:05] trespass against thee, go and tell him
[58:08] his fault between thee and him alone.
[58:10] And if he shall hear thee, thou hast
[58:12] gained thy brother." So I I I like how
[58:15] Jesus put that. Now, that was before
[58:16] Facebook or Instagram or any of that
[58:19] kind of stuff. Amen. That's that's
[58:21] sometimes where we like to put a lot of
[58:22] things. Amen. But he said, "Go and bring
[58:24] them between thee and him alone. But if
[58:26] he will not hear thee, then take three
[58:28] or one take with thee one or two more
[58:30] with them that in the mouth of three two
[58:32] or three witnesses, every word may be
[58:34] established." And and if he shall
[58:36] neglect to hear them, tell it to the
[58:38] church. But if he neglect to hear the
[58:39] church, let him be as a heathen man or a
[58:42] publican. He says, "Verily I say unto
[58:44] you, whatsoever you bind on earth shall
[58:47] be bound in heaven, and whatsoever you
[58:48] shall loose upon earth shall be loosed
[58:50] in heaven. And again I say that if two
[58:53] of you shall agree on earth as touching
[58:55] anything that they shall ask, and it
[58:57] shall be done of them my father which is
[58:59] in heaven. For where two or three are
[59:01] gathered in his name or in my name,
[59:03] there I am in the midst." But then you
[59:05] know Peter came and he said, "Well, I
[59:06] got a question. Lord, how often shall my
[59:09] brother sin him against me and I forgive
[59:11] him till seven times? That's that's
[59:13] pretty big deal. I I didn't just forgive
[59:15] him once. I didn't just forgive him
[59:17] twice, but I went all the way to seven.
[59:19] He says, "Therefore is the kingdom of
[59:21] heaven likened unto a certain king which
[59:23] taketh," let me back up. He said, Jesus
[59:25] said, "And I say not unto thee unto
[59:27] seven times, but until 70 times seven."
[59:31] Amen. 70 times seven. Therefore is the
[59:34] kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain
[59:36] king which would take an account of his
[59:38] servants. And I won't won't read all
[59:40] this, but we know the story of how how
[59:42] this man was brought before him and he
[59:44] owed an insurmountable sum. It was
[59:47] unpayable debt. He couldn't pay the debt
[59:49] that he owed. I I done a study on it one
[59:51] time. It was somewhere around equivalent
[59:53] of today around two or three million.
[59:55] Now, if somebody come in and showed you
[59:58] all the receipts and all the things that
[59:59] you owed two or three a million dollars,
[1:00:01] I doubt very many of us could come up
[1:00:03] with that kind of money right now and
[1:00:05] pay that debt off. This is where that
[1:00:07] man was. And and he's looking at his
[1:00:09] children being thrown in jail and his
[1:00:11] wife being everything being taken from
[1:00:13] him. And he begins to cry out to the
[1:00:15] Lord and he begins to cry out to the
[1:00:16] king and he said, "Oh, king, forgive
[1:00:18] me." And and it moved the king's heart
[1:00:21] to where he came and he he wiped all of
[1:00:23] his debt away. He he wiped it all out.
[1:00:26] And he said, "This same man though, as
[1:00:28] he was forgiven, he walks out of the
[1:00:29] king's chambers and he goes right down.
[1:00:32] He walk, you know, kind of out of church
[1:00:33] and he goes right down into another
[1:00:35] place and he finds somebody that owed
[1:00:37] him a few dollars." And I I looked at
[1:00:38] that. It was about 17 bucks. That's not
[1:00:41] very much money. I I bet most of us
[1:00:43] could come up with that tonight. Amen.
[1:00:45] But this man owed him about $17. And he
[1:00:48] and the scripture says he grabbed him by
[1:00:50] the throat and he throwed him into jail.
[1:00:52] and and and and then King was told all
[1:00:54] about that and he was very wroth. Amen.
[1:00:56] He said, "How could somebody that was
[1:00:58] forgiven of so much hold something
[1:01:01] against somebody so little?"
[1:01:04] Amen. I think that's where we need to
[1:01:05] look at ourselves sometimes because we
[1:01:07] have been forgiven of so much. Amen. The
[1:01:10] King of Kings came down and he forgave
[1:01:13] us of so many sins and so many debts and
[1:01:16] so many things. There's no way we could
[1:01:18] have settled our books. There's not
[1:01:20] enough things we could have done to pay
[1:01:21] the penance and and to pay the debt that
[1:01:24] we owe. But he came down and he wrote it
[1:01:26] all off and he wrote it across in blood
[1:01:29] wrote letters. Amen. Forgiven. Amen. And
[1:01:32] then we walk right out and we hold
[1:01:34] little petty things against one another.
[1:01:36] We hold this thought against somebody
[1:01:38] and we hold this. Listen, God is wanting
[1:01:41] more out of us. He's wanting more. Amen.
[1:01:44] We want the spoken word. We need to get
[1:01:46] these things in our heart and say, "God,
[1:01:48] if there be anything that I've hid down
[1:01:51] in the depths of my heart that you'll
[1:01:53] forgive me and let me also forgive
[1:01:55] others." Cuz I want you to understand
[1:01:58] the forgiveness that you rece you give
[1:02:01] is the same forgiveness that you
[1:02:02] receive.
[1:02:04] This is what he said in the Lord's
[1:02:05] prayer. He said, "Father, forgive us as
[1:02:08] we forgive our debtors." So as we
[1:02:11] forgive, then we are forgiven.
[1:02:14] All right. Amen. So this man, he could,
[1:02:17] you know, he couldn't enjoy his freedom.
[1:02:19] He had freedom. He had forgiveness. But
[1:02:21] because of his unforgiveness towards
[1:02:23] somebody else, you know, when you fail
[1:02:25] to forgive someone, you become a
[1:02:27] prisoner to the past.
[1:02:30] Come on. Many hold unforgiveness
[1:02:32] thinking they if they if I forgive this
[1:02:34] person, it's going to let them off the
[1:02:37] wrong they done and they going to get
[1:02:38] off scot-free. No. If they have sinned
[1:02:41] and they have done wrong, they will give
[1:02:43] an account. But what forgiveness is not
[1:02:46] letting someone else go. It's letting
[1:02:48] you go. It's letting you be free from
[1:02:52] the prison that Satan wants to hold you
[1:02:54] in. Come on. Forgiveness is not letting
[1:02:57] somebody else go who had done wrong.
[1:02:59] It's letting you go. But see,
[1:03:01] unforgiveness, it keeps the pain fresh.
[1:03:04] It keeps it alive. It never lets the
[1:03:07] wound heal.
[1:03:09] Come on. I know where I'm at tonight.
[1:03:12] Then you go through life always
[1:03:13] reminding you of what's been done to you
[1:03:16] and what's somebody else and it's always
[1:03:18] there and you begin to accumulate bad
[1:03:20] feelings
[1:03:22] and then you begin to accumulate
[1:03:23] unforgiveness and it puts you in a
[1:03:25] prison of past and and it robs you of
[1:03:28] the joy of the present.
[1:03:31] Amen. When you forgive though, it opens
[1:03:33] the door of the prison and lets you out.
[1:03:39] Amen. Forgiveness sets you free from the
[1:03:41] past.
[1:03:43] Amen. Those that have sinned and done
[1:03:45] wrong, they're going to give an account.
[1:03:49] Come on. But if you continue to allow
[1:03:51] the offense and you never forgive, then
[1:03:54] you allow that person to continue to
[1:03:57] offend you the rest of your life.
[1:04:01] That's right. So unforgiveness, it
[1:04:03] accumulates. It accumulates bitterness.
[1:04:06] And then bitterness accumulates
[1:04:07] resentment. And the longer the offense
[1:04:10] is, Amen. not forgiven, the more you
[1:04:12] accumulate.
[1:04:14] Amen. The more you be, it begins to
[1:04:16] shape. You see, unforgiveness brings
[1:04:18] bitterness. Bitterness brings anger.
[1:04:21] Anger brings resentment.
[1:04:24] Now, I want to deal with resentment for
[1:04:26] just a moment because it's a very very
[1:04:28] uh interesting subject. Resentment is a
[1:04:31] complex emotion that can be described as
[1:04:34] a combination of anger, bitterness,
[1:04:37] disgust, disappointment, and
[1:04:40] disapproval. It's a reaction of being
[1:04:42] mistreated wrong by someone, whether
[1:04:45] that be real or perceived.
[1:04:48] That's right. Amen. Because there's some
[1:04:51] wrongs we take that really wasn't meant
[1:04:53] to be wrong, but it's how we perceive
[1:04:55] something. Amen. But I remember but the
[1:04:59] scripture talks about amen the root of
[1:05:01] bitterness in Hebrews 12 and verse14 it
[1:05:04] says follow peace with all men and
[1:05:06] holiness and without with with no man
[1:05:09] can see the Lord looking diligently lest
[1:05:11] any man fail of the grace of God lest
[1:05:14] any root of bitterness now not just
[1:05:16] bitterness but a root of bitterness this
[1:05:19] root signifies something that is
[1:05:22] deepseated it's an underlying issue that
[1:05:25] can grow and it won't be noticed
[1:05:29] Amen. How many goes out and looks at the
[1:05:31] roots? No. You look at the tree or the
[1:05:33] flowers or the plants that's up on top
[1:05:35] of the ground, but down underneath
[1:05:37] there's roots. Amen. And those roots are
[1:05:39] spread. And if that root of bitterness
[1:05:42] is left unchecked, it'll spread because
[1:05:44] that's what roots do. You know, it's
[1:05:46] also translated here as a bitter root.
[1:05:49] In other words, if the root is bitter,
[1:05:51] the fruit is also bitter.
[1:05:54] Amen. The root is not seen. It can grow.
[1:05:57] It can cause issues and and you'll not
[1:05:59] even realize that bitterness or
[1:06:01] resentment can fester in a person's
[1:06:03] heart and affect their life. It'll
[1:06:05] affect their their relationships
[1:06:08] negatively if not dealt with.
[1:06:12] Describing it as a root is showing that
[1:06:14] it's not just a fleeting
[1:06:16] emotion. Okay? It's not a fleeting
[1:06:18] emotion or feeling or something, but
[1:06:21] it's something that's ingrained into
[1:06:22] your
[1:06:24] attitude. Woo. Hallelujah.
[1:06:27] Amen. It can produce negative
[1:06:29] consequences. To overcome it, you have
[1:06:32] to constantly uproot it. You got to dig
[1:06:35] it out.
[1:06:37] Come on, buddy. Amen. I We're not
[1:06:39] talking about being surface Christians
[1:06:41] here.
[1:06:43] Anybody can be a surface Christian and
[1:06:45] they they can look like a Christian, act
[1:06:47] like a Christian at church, but deep
[1:06:49] down inside of them, they have resented
[1:06:51] something and it's holding them back.
[1:06:53] That's right.
[1:06:55] Amen. And they needing something more in
[1:06:57] their lives and they're wondering why I
[1:06:59] can't get why does it always leave? Why?
[1:07:01] Why is this always happening? Because
[1:07:03] that root is growing, growing, growing.
[1:07:06] But tonight, there's a sword that's
[1:07:08] being granted to you. That you can take
[1:07:10] the sword of the word and you can cut
[1:07:13] that root out.
[1:07:15] Maybe a preacher did you wrong. Maybe
[1:07:17] somebody did you wrong. But you can say,
[1:07:19] "God, I forgive them.
[1:07:22] I'm here to let it go." Oh, listen. It's
[1:07:24] time we let petty things go. It's time
[1:07:27] we lay aside all of it and we lay aside
[1:07:30] our our thoughts and what we think ought
[1:07:32] to be done or how we think it ought to
[1:07:34] be and we say, "God, this is your
[1:07:36] church. These are your people and you
[1:07:40] are doing the work in their lives. And
[1:07:43] if I got anything inside of me, cut it
[1:07:45] out."
[1:07:49] Listen, bitterness and resentment is not
[1:07:51] always towards someone, but many times
[1:07:54] people become bitter towards God.
[1:07:58] Bitter because their way their life has
[1:08:00] turned out. They they didn't want it to
[1:08:01] be that way or because of a prayer that
[1:08:04] seems to be unanswered.
[1:08:08] Come on.
[1:08:13] God allows you to go through valleys and
[1:08:15] trials to see how you're going to
[1:08:17] respond.
[1:08:20] You know, one day the children of
[1:08:21] Israel, they came through the Red Sea
[1:08:23] and God had brought them through a great
[1:08:25] victory. You know, in spite of all their
[1:08:27] doubt and unbelief.
[1:08:29] In spite of it all. Some of you are here
[1:08:32] in spite of it all.
[1:08:36] In spite of their doubts and in spite of
[1:08:38] their unbelief. In spite of all of that,
[1:08:40] God still opened up the sea.
[1:08:43] And he still took them across on dry
[1:08:45] land and he still destroyed their enemy.
[1:08:48] With just a few moments, they were
[1:08:50] screaming, "Why did you bring us out
[1:08:51] here? So we could die where there not
[1:08:53] graves in Egypt." But in spite of all of
[1:08:55] that, he still brought them through.
[1:09:00] I'm glad he's a God like that. In spite
[1:09:02] of my shortcomings, in spite of my
[1:09:04] faults, in spite of my doubts, in spite
[1:09:07] of my fears, he's still making a way
[1:09:10] through.
[1:09:11] [Applause]
[1:09:15] Oh, they came across that stream and
[1:09:17] they got on the other side and God just
[1:09:19] closed it in on the enemies and old task
[1:09:21] masters. He said, "Could you imagine the
[1:09:23] feeling that they felt when they looked
[1:09:26] back there and the very things that had
[1:09:27] whipped them and beat them, put stripes
[1:09:29] on them, pulled them out, pulled them
[1:09:31] down was now dead, floating in the sea."
[1:09:35] Woo! Hallelujah. He said, "Brother, when
[1:09:37] you come through the Red Sea of the
[1:09:38] blood of Jesus Christ, and you see all
[1:09:40] those dirty habits that drove you to do
[1:09:43] things you didn't want to do, and you
[1:09:44] find them dead in the blood of Jesus
[1:09:46] Christ, hallelujah, you see him floating
[1:09:48] down, head down in the stream. No wonder
[1:09:51] Moses got in the spirit. No wonder
[1:09:53] Miriam picked up a tambourine and
[1:09:55] started dancing down the street down the
[1:09:57] banks. Why? Their enemy was dead.
[1:10:01] In spite of it all, they were dead.
[1:10:06] Preach, buddy. But after the big song
[1:10:09] was over
[1:10:12] and the big shout they had and the big
[1:10:14] hallelujah big time, they started
[1:10:16] through the wilderness and he led them
[1:10:18] straight to bitter waters.
[1:10:21] Amen. Wow. Straight to bitter waters.
[1:10:24] Isn't that strange? He says right into
[1:10:26] temptation, right into a water that was
[1:10:28] so bitter they couldn't drink. They had
[1:10:30] nothing to eat, nothing to drink. The
[1:10:32] streams of Mara, bitter waters laid
[1:10:34] right in their path. looked like God
[1:10:36] could have bypassed that, but he led
[1:10:38] them straight to it. He said, "Some are
[1:10:41] through the water, some through the
[1:10:42] flood, some through deep trials, but all
[1:10:44] through the blood." That's God's way of
[1:10:46] leading his people. But how soon they
[1:10:49] begin to resent God for bringing them to
[1:10:52] that place? Like many today resent God
[1:10:55] for the situation they're in.
[1:10:59] They resent God for how their life has
[1:11:01] worked out or what's happened among them
[1:11:03] or what's going on. and they're
[1:11:05] resenting God for it.
[1:11:08] Here they go through the wilderness and
[1:11:10] after an oldfashioned meat and they're
[1:11:11] on their journey. He said, "Isn't it
[1:11:13] strange? They was led right to this
[1:11:15] place, a fountain of bitter waters.
[1:11:17] Could you imagine God taking children
[1:11:19] right after they got saved filled with
[1:11:21] the Holy Ghost to fountains of bitter
[1:11:22] waters?" Sure, he likes to express his
[1:11:25] love to them.
[1:11:28] Thank you, Lord. Well, I thought his
[1:11:30] love was expressed in the Red Sea.
[1:11:32] That's what the prophet of God said. He
[1:11:35] likes to express their his love to them
[1:11:37] at bitter waters.
[1:11:40] You know, when you get the Holy Ghost,
[1:11:41] you attend a lot of obstacles. The Bible
[1:11:44] says, "Many are the afflictions of the
[1:11:45] righteous, but the Lord God delivers
[1:11:47] them out of them all." God brings you
[1:11:49] right to it. Face it so he can show you
[1:11:52] his power and his goodness.
[1:11:55] He talks about a shepherd that that had
[1:11:58] a had a lamb over his shoulders and he
[1:12:00] had a broke leg. And somebody asked him
[1:12:02] said, "What happened? Did it fall off a
[1:12:03] cliff?" He said, "No, I broke it." He
[1:12:06] said, "Why would you do that?" He said,
[1:12:07] "Because it was not dependent on me
[1:12:09] anymore and it was getting too far out
[1:12:11] and so I've just broke its leg so I
[1:12:13] could show it a little more love."
[1:12:18] Hallelujah. Anyhow, we don't like no leg
[1:12:20] breakings,
[1:12:23] but sometimes God will snap the leg
[1:12:25] right out from under us. We be strutting
[1:12:27] around, got our heads in the cloud. Look
[1:12:28] what I've done. Look how I've overcome.
[1:12:30] And God said, "Hey, you're not trusting
[1:12:32] me enough." Snap.
[1:12:35] Why? Because he's wanting to show his
[1:12:37] love.
[1:12:39] He's a shepherd.
[1:12:42] Said, "God can do." He said, "Sometimes
[1:12:44] God will lay you on your back with a
[1:12:47] sickness and the doctor says you're
[1:12:48] going to die." God can. So, but God does
[1:12:50] that so he can give you a little special
[1:12:52] treatment
[1:12:54] and you'll love him a little more. I
[1:12:57] know the world don't understand that,
[1:12:58] but that's the way God operates.
[1:13:02] Amen. So, but we allow things to lay
[1:13:05] there. Brother Brandham talks about he
[1:13:06] talks about bitterness in a lot of
[1:13:08] places. You can do a study on that. He
[1:13:10] said, "Always try to do something good.
[1:13:13] Just keep being good."
[1:13:17] Well, we we'll get on to the shout
[1:13:19] material tomorrow. Okay.
[1:13:22] All right. Don't let any bitterness, no
[1:13:24] matter how bad the person is, how bad
[1:13:27] they talk about you, don't you ever
[1:13:29] think evil in your heart against them.
[1:13:34] Cuz right there is where the devil will
[1:13:36] get a hold of you and work something
[1:13:38] right there. Just keep it all covered up
[1:13:41] with God's love, confession, making
[1:13:43] right. Do good to those who do evil to
[1:13:46] you. Amen.
[1:13:49] If you only do good to those who do good
[1:13:51] to you, why you're just a publican or
[1:13:53] somebody a sinner does that. Anybody can
[1:13:56] be good to those that do good to them,
[1:13:58] but be good to those who are not good to
[1:14:00] you.
[1:14:02] Do something for those that would not do
[1:14:04] nothing for you.
[1:14:08] I know people get tore up. Well, we
[1:14:09] ain't never invited over anywhere. Well,
[1:14:11] why don't you start inviting people over
[1:14:13] to your house? Uh oh. I'm pastoring now,
[1:14:15] ain't it? Sorry.
[1:14:17] [Applause]
[1:14:20] Get all tore up. We ain't in the circle.
[1:14:23] Won't you just draw your circle a little
[1:14:24] bigger?
[1:14:27] Amen. Speak a good word for a man that
[1:14:29] would speak evil against you. And that
[1:14:31] way you keep all bitterness out of your
[1:14:33] heart.
[1:14:36] That's right.
[1:14:38] Ephesians 4:29 teaches, "Let no corrupt
[1:14:40] communication proceed out of your mouth,
[1:14:43] but that which is good to the use of
[1:14:45] edifying, that it may minister grace
[1:14:47] unto the hearers." Come on now. And
[1:14:51] grieve not the Holy Spirit of God,
[1:14:52] whereby you are sealed unto the day of
[1:14:54] redemption. Let all bitterness, wrath,
[1:14:56] and anger, and clamor, and evil speaking
[1:14:58] be put away from you with all malice. Be
[1:15:00] ye kind one to another, tender-hearted,
[1:15:02] forgiving one another, even as God for
[1:15:04] Christ's sake has forgiven you.
[1:15:07] But resentment sensing and brother
[1:15:09] Brandham deals with this in in a several
[1:15:11] couple ways and I just want to drop them
[1:15:13] in here because it's very powerful. He
[1:15:15] said if you got a resenting audience,
[1:15:18] the Holy Spirit won't even reveal.
[1:15:24] All right. You got to have things
[1:15:26] working together. We're supposed to be
[1:15:28] in one place and one accord. Then there
[1:15:30] come a sound from heaven. He said, "No
[1:15:33] matter how much I pray and I lay down
[1:15:35] day and night and I study and I'm
[1:15:37] walking before God and anointing on me
[1:15:39] and I walk out here and I feel that
[1:15:41] resentment, that just grieavves him away
[1:15:43] and he won't reveal anything."
[1:15:47] He said, "But when you walk down under
[1:15:49] the anointing and you feel the audience
[1:15:51] is also under the anointing,
[1:15:55] hallelujah." Amen. That's when the Holy
[1:15:57] Ghost begins to work. He begins to move
[1:16:00] and then he will do great things for us.
[1:16:05] That's why we got to get it keep it
[1:16:06] driven out of our midst and driven out
[1:16:09] of our hearts and driven out of our
[1:16:11] audience and driven out of our church.
[1:16:13] We can't allow some resenting spirit to
[1:16:16] come in and try to sit down and clamp
[1:16:18] down upon the mercies and grace of
[1:16:20] almighty God.
[1:16:22] He's wanting to reveal himself to us.
[1:16:27] You know, he said in one place he said
[1:16:29] it was a man and his wife. First time
[1:16:30] they ever come to one of my meetings,
[1:16:32] they were sitting in the audience and
[1:16:35] the lady came in and sat down by side of
[1:16:37] them. And the little lady resented
[1:16:40] that. And the lady was sitting close cuz
[1:16:43] she was, you know, she was in this
[1:16:45] woman's way. And this woman actually
[1:16:47] made her move
[1:16:48] back. Pretty bold, ain't it? Well, I've
[1:16:51] seen it. You're in my pew.
[1:16:55] I got my That's my seat.
[1:17:01] Hallelujah. Well, I seen I heard a
[1:17:03] resenting spirit right
[1:17:09] there. After a while, the little lady
[1:17:11] made her move back. And this woman that
[1:17:14] had to move back, she resented the
[1:17:16] woman.
[1:17:18] And the woman in front of her resented
[1:17:20] her, resented her. That's what he says.
[1:17:23] Amen. But she got to praying
[1:17:27] and she said, "Lord, I shouldn't have
[1:17:28] done that. Forgive me. I didn't mean to
[1:17:31] do that." Then the lady was in front
[1:17:33] that had resent her said, "Sister, I'm
[1:17:35] so sorry. I shouldn't have done that."
[1:17:38] And they were both sick. But just after
[1:17:40] a little bit after that was done,
[1:17:45] after that was done, I seen the angel of
[1:17:47] the Lord stand over them, called them by
[1:17:50] name, and healed them both.
[1:17:54] Hallelujah.
[1:17:59] Come on. And it sent them back home.
[1:18:02] Well, again,
[1:18:04] this is why we have to keep it out of
[1:18:07] our hearts.
[1:18:09] Well, I want the power of spoken word.
[1:18:12] Well, the power of spoken word you need
[1:18:13] is I forgive.
[1:18:18] That's right.
[1:18:20] Brother Brandon talks about Edmond Way
[1:18:23] said he was sitting in the audience and
[1:18:24] he said something brother Edmond didn't
[1:18:27] agree with or had some issue with and he
[1:18:29] started resenting what he said and he
[1:18:31] fell over with a heart attack. Amen.
[1:18:34] His wife even testified to that. They
[1:18:37] would they would actually come to my my
[1:18:40] dad's house as he was a young guy young
[1:18:42] boy and she would demonstrate it all and
[1:18:44] show exactly how it happened. He said,
[1:18:46] but he said she brother B said when he
[1:18:48] knelt down to pray for him he said of
[1:18:50] course the audience got all tore up and
[1:18:52] he said don't do that just stay still
[1:18:53] and see what God would do and he gets
[1:18:55] down and he said the wife spoke to him
[1:18:57] and said he was resenting what you're
[1:18:59] what you were
[1:19:00] saying come on said he was a real
[1:19:04] hotheaded Englishman you know and he
[1:19:05] resented that his wife was a wonderful
[1:19:08] Norwegian woman a nurse and was sitting
[1:19:10] there with him and I said something he
[1:19:12] resented it and they were standing on
[1:19:14] their feet and they were singing And
[1:19:16] when he did, his head went back. His
[1:19:18] eyes flipped right back and his face
[1:19:19] turned dark red and he fell dead on the
[1:19:22] floor. And his wife got down and tested
[1:19:24] his heart and he was gone. She began
[1:19:26] screaming. I said, "Sister, wait a
[1:19:27] minute. I'll get out of the pool pit. We
[1:19:29] don't know what the father has has
[1:19:30] here." And he he's trying to keep it
[1:19:32] there very still. And and he said,
[1:19:33] "Maybe maybe God did this for a
[1:19:35] purpose." And she said he and she said,
[1:19:37] "He whispered she whispered and said, he
[1:19:39] whispered to me that he was resenting
[1:19:41] what you said." And I said, "He ought
[1:19:43] not to have done that." But I said,
[1:19:45] "Heavenly Father, forgive brother
[1:19:47] Wayey." He didn't mean to do that. And I
[1:19:50] called for his spirit to return. And he
[1:19:52] said, "Brother Bradam,
[1:19:57] listen, I'm not I I pray nobody falls
[1:19:59] dead with a heart attack." But listen,
[1:20:02] Satan puts that resentment on you and it
[1:20:05] will give you a spiritually heart
[1:20:07] seizure
[1:20:09] and your heart will harden and and it
[1:20:11] will turn to where blood can't flow and
[1:20:13] and the blood can't flow to the rest of
[1:20:15] the body. Why? Because you resented what
[1:20:18] was said from the pull pit or you
[1:20:21] resented what you heard, amen, from the
[1:20:23] angel of God ministering there in the
[1:20:25] pullpit. Listen, we ought to be very
[1:20:27] honest before God tonight and say, "God,
[1:20:29] I don't want to have that attitude. I
[1:20:31] don't I don't want to have no kind of
[1:20:32] thing against nobody, anybody. I don't
[1:20:35] even want to have it against the
[1:20:36] mailman, the UPA. Why? I don't want
[1:20:38] nothing against nobody.
[1:20:41] I want to drive it all out of my life,
[1:20:44] Father, that the word can be made
[1:20:46] manifest.
[1:20:51] Hallelujah. So, unforgiveness brings
[1:20:52] bitterness. Bitterness brings anger.
[1:20:54] Anger brings resentment.
[1:20:57] But I want you to understand,
[1:20:58] forgiveness also accumulates.
[1:21:03] It washes bitterness away and anger away
[1:21:06] and resentment away and it accumulates
[1:21:10] love and joy and peace and goodness and
[1:21:13] gentleness. Unforgiveness though gives a
[1:21:15] devil an open door.
[1:21:19] But we must close that door and forgive.
[1:21:22] Amen.
[1:21:24] To forgive is to turn the key and open
[1:21:27] the cell door and let the prisoner out.
[1:21:30] You
[1:21:32] to forgive is to bundle up all the
[1:21:34] garbage and dispose of it, leaving the
[1:21:36] house clean and fresh. To forgive is to
[1:21:40] relax a strangle hold on a wrestling
[1:21:42] opponent and give him his life. To
[1:21:44] forgive is to sand blast the walls of
[1:21:47] graffiti, leaving it looking like new.
[1:21:49] Forgiveness is so important.
[1:21:52] It's right at the right at the center of
[1:21:55] your spiritual well-being.
[1:21:58] That's right. Yes.
[1:22:01] He said, you know, he said, you know
[1:22:03] what a blessing is? Do something for
[1:22:05] somebody else.
[1:22:11] People get bitter because the preacher
[1:22:13] didn't come see them at the hospital.
[1:22:15] People get bitter over a lot of things.
[1:22:16] I can go through a whole list.
[1:22:20] We always want our own self petted. We
[1:22:23] want our own self, you know, you know,
[1:22:25] we just just just right. Amen.
[1:22:29] Brother Ron didn't shake my hand today.
[1:22:31] You know, that's what that's that song,
[1:22:33] excuses, excuses. I hear them every day.
[1:22:35] Ever heard that song? Anybody ever heard
[1:22:36] it? Well, the preacher didn't even shake
[1:22:38] my hand. So, we got we got excuse. You
[1:22:42] know, there was one time my papa told
[1:22:44] this. He said, he said there was a
[1:22:45] family stayed home from church and they
[1:22:46] asked him, "Well, why what what was
[1:22:48] going?" He said, "Well, we was out of
[1:22:49] peanut
[1:22:51] butter." Said, "Out of peanut butter?
[1:22:54] What's that got to do with going to
[1:22:55] church?" Well, just as good as one
[1:22:56] excuse as it is
[1:22:58] another. Didn't really have a good
[1:23:05] excuse. Hallelujah. But some people get
[1:23:08] so tore up about little things and they
[1:23:11] allow it to sit there. Yeah. said, "If
[1:23:14] you have a neighbor or somebody that's
[1:23:15] done you injustice, remember this for
[1:23:17] me. Don't ever turn him down.
[1:23:21] Take him to God in prayer and see what
[1:23:23] different attitude you'll have."
[1:23:27] Hallelujah. If you're sincere in your
[1:23:28] prayer, you'll stand
[1:23:29] shoulder-to-shoulder with him. Though
[1:23:31] he's done you wrong, you'll take that
[1:23:32] man to God and stand there in the
[1:23:34] presence of the father one time. Father,
[1:23:36] my neighbor here has done me wrong, but
[1:23:37] I get watch. When you go to tell him is
[1:23:39] wrong, it'll not only help him, but it
[1:23:41] also help you to the father. Not to
[1:23:42] Facebook,
[1:23:45] to the father. Watch what he go tell him
[1:23:47] is wrong. It not only help him, but
[1:23:48] it'll help you. And you'll see what he's
[1:23:50] been through and the temptation and
[1:23:52] it'll change your attitude towards that
[1:23:55] brother.
[1:23:56] It'll help him also. You always are
[1:23:59] doing good when you're praying one for
[1:24:01] the other.
[1:24:03] See, the devil can keep us separated.
[1:24:05] He's got us shooting at one another. So,
[1:24:07] he's got an open target anywhere he
[1:24:08] wants to shoot. What's the use of
[1:24:10] shooting? We're shooting one another. He
[1:24:12] can just sit back and relax. He said,
[1:24:14] "But if I have found grace in your sight
[1:24:16] through God, you take my word for this."
[1:24:18] Well, I think we ought to pay attention.
[1:24:21] If you want to be a blessing and get a
[1:24:23] blessing, how many wants that?
[1:24:25] When a man has done you wrong, he's
[1:24:27] absolutely I mean, he's done you wrong
[1:24:29] and you know he's done you wrong. He's
[1:24:31] done you
[1:24:32] evil. Don't mention that. Amen.
[1:24:37] You take him to prayer before God and
[1:24:40] don't take it in a selfish way and say,
[1:24:42] "Well, I'm just supposed to do this."
[1:24:43] But stand with your shoulder to his
[1:24:45] shoulder and stand in the presence of
[1:24:47] our father. A way a prayer should make
[1:24:49] be made in the presence of God. Father,
[1:24:51] here's my brother. He may deserve
[1:24:54] punishment. What he's done is evil. I
[1:24:56] don't see why he's done it, but let God
[1:24:59] go to talk to you. Then maybe you'll see
[1:25:01] what that man's been
[1:25:03] through. Right.
[1:25:09] The devil has twisted him up somewhere
[1:25:10] and caused him to do that. Though he's
[1:25:12] absolutely wrong. Before you leave the
[1:25:14] throne of God, you'll be feeling sorry
[1:25:16] for that man. You'll be sympathizing
[1:25:17] with him. And when you get back down to
[1:25:19] earth again, you'll go over that brother
[1:25:21] and shake his hand because you know what
[1:25:22] he's been through. You cannot stand with
[1:25:25] a mortal in the presence of God and
[1:25:27] condemn anybody.
[1:25:30] I don't believe. No, sir. Even if he's a
[1:25:32] rank sinner,
[1:25:35] right? What about a brother that's made
[1:25:37] a mistake? Though I say he's wrong,
[1:25:39] sometimes he's accused of wrong and he
[1:25:40] ain't done wrong. But if he is wrong, if
[1:25:42] we'll take him to the throne of God and
[1:25:44] stand there shoulderto-shoulder with our
[1:25:46] brother, knowing he's a mortal and maybe
[1:25:48] his destination rest upon our attitude
[1:25:51] towards him. Wow.
[1:25:54] When we come back from the throne of
[1:25:56] God, we'll realize we're everyone
[1:25:58] guilty.
[1:26:00] And we all need help.
[1:26:04] We all need help.
[1:26:08] He said, "We must respect each other and
[1:26:11] love each other and show respect." He
[1:26:13] said, "Listen, listen. What showing
[1:26:14] respect one another do?" Watch this.
[1:26:16] This is incredible. I believe it was a
[1:26:19] few nights here ago somewhere there was
[1:26:22] a woman. I believe she was from
[1:26:24] Jamaica. All right? So, I believe that
[1:26:26] was in Jamaica that she was sitting
[1:26:28] there and she gave a place. She was
[1:26:30] crippled, but she gave a
[1:26:33] place, respected a woman who had a heart
[1:26:35] trouble and she gave her place in
[1:26:39] line. Wow. She need had a need, but she
[1:26:43] gave this woman her place in
[1:26:45] line and the Holy Spirit saw it.
[1:26:51] And because she did that, the Holy
[1:26:53] Spirit came back around and healed her.
[1:26:56] see love and and love and show respect
[1:26:59] to one another. If you want God to hear
[1:27:01] your prayer, if you want God to send an
[1:27:03] angel to your home, live right, do
[1:27:05] right, treat everybody right, be right
[1:27:08] before God, and God will grant that to
[1:27:10] you
[1:27:14] cuz you don't know what's beneath
[1:27:15] beneath that little old skin sitting
[1:27:17] there. The Holy Spirit may be tabernacle
[1:27:20] behind skin.
[1:27:23] Amen. We must be brothers. We must treat
[1:27:25] them right. No matter if he is wrong,
[1:27:27] still treat him nice.
[1:27:31] Oh, it's hard to do. I'm not saying it's
[1:27:33] easy, but that's what the Bible says. Do
[1:27:35] you must be Christians full of love,
[1:27:37] ready to help any race, color, creed,
[1:27:39] anywhere, any time. We must be the way
[1:27:41] that's Christians, cuz somebody's
[1:27:43] watching your life.
[1:27:49] Be honest. Let your dealings be fair and
[1:27:52] square. Don't take nothing that doesn't
[1:27:55] belong to you.
[1:28:00] You know, we don't have to be the one
[1:28:01] that always comes up on out on top on
[1:28:03] deals.
[1:28:05] [Music]
[1:28:07] Hallelujah.
[1:28:08] Anyhow, treat everybody right. And if
[1:28:11] they don't treat you right, you treat
[1:28:13] them right anyhow.
[1:28:15] Jesus treated us right when we didn't
[1:28:17] treat him right.
[1:28:21] Come on, somebody. Do unto others as
[1:28:24] you'd have them do unto you. It's
[1:28:26] scripture.
[1:28:30] If you don't like what I'm preaching
[1:28:31] tonight, you can blame him. But there
[1:28:34] goes that resentment again. Need to deal
[1:28:36] with it.
[1:28:37] [Applause]
[1:28:41] Get that thing out of your heart.
[1:28:43] It ain't worth staying here for.
[1:28:49] There ain't nothing that's worth staying
[1:28:51] here for. This tree is bound for glory.
[1:28:56] [Applause]
[1:29:02] John 13:34 says, "A new commandment I
[1:29:05] give unto you that you love one
[1:29:06] another." That's a commandment that from
[1:29:08] Jesus, red letter, "that you love one
[1:29:11] another as I have loved you." Uhoh.
[1:29:15] Amen. that you also love one another. By
[1:29:19] this shall all men know that you are my
[1:29:21] disciples. Ain't that something? Not by
[1:29:25] speaking to storms and squirrels into
[1:29:28] existence. I'm not That was powerful.
[1:29:29] I'm not making fun of that, making light
[1:29:31] of it. I'm just saying by this
[1:29:35] others will know who you really are.
[1:29:38] Amen.
[1:29:41] That's John 15:12 said, "This is my
[1:29:44] commandment that you love one another as
[1:29:46] I have loved you. Greater love hath no
[1:29:48] man than this than a man lay down his
[1:29:49] life for his friends. And you are my
[1:29:51] friends and ye do whatsoever I command
[1:29:53] you. You have not chosen me, but I have
[1:29:55] chosen you and ordained you that you
[1:29:58] should go and bring forth fruit and that
[1:29:59] your fruit shall remain that whatsoever
[1:30:01] you ask of the Father in my name, he may
[1:30:03] give it to you. These things I command
[1:30:06] you, that you love one another.
[1:30:09] 1 Thessalonians 4:9 said, "But as
[1:30:11] touching brotherly love, you need not
[1:30:13] that I write unto you. For ye yourselves
[1:30:16] are taught of God to love one another."
[1:30:20] 1 Peter 1:22, "See, and you have
[1:30:22] purified your souls, and obeying the
[1:30:24] truth of the spirit under unfame love of
[1:30:26] the brother. See that you love one
[1:30:28] another with a pure heart, fervently,
[1:30:31] being born again, not of corruptible
[1:30:33] seed, but of incorruptible by the word
[1:30:35] of God, which liveth and abideth
[1:30:38] forever.
[1:30:39] 1 John 3:11 said, "For this is the
[1:30:41] message that you've heard from the
[1:30:43] beginning, that you should love one
[1:30:45] another, not as Cain, who was of that
[1:30:48] wicked one, and slew his brother
[1:30:54] by his words." No doubt he told Abel, "I
[1:30:56] love you, buddy."
[1:31:00] Put his arm around him that morning.
[1:31:01] Boy, it's so good to go to church with
[1:31:03] you this morning. It's so wonderful. I
[1:31:06] can't wait to see what God's going to
[1:31:07] do. I love you, Abel.
[1:31:12] That's what he said. Not as Cain
[1:31:14] that you love one another. Not as Cain
[1:31:17] who slew his brother.
[1:31:20] His words said one thing, but his deed
[1:31:22] said another.
[1:31:25] And whoso and who wherefore slew he him
[1:31:28] because his own works are evil and his
[1:31:30] brother's righteousnesses marvel not my
[1:31:32] brother. If the world hates you, you
[1:31:33] know that we passed from death unto life
[1:31:35] because we love the brethren.
[1:31:40] Huh? You know that we have passed from
[1:31:42] death unto life because we have the
[1:31:44] spoken word. Because because we love the
[1:31:48] brethren,
[1:31:49] right? And he that loveth not his
[1:31:52] brother abideth in death. Amen. And
[1:31:54] whosoever hateth his brother is a
[1:31:56] murderer.
[1:31:59] And you know that no murderer has
[1:32:01] eternal life abiding in him. Hereby
[1:32:02] receive we the love of God. Because he
[1:32:04] laid down his life for us. We ought to
[1:32:06] lay down our lives for the
[1:32:09] brethren. And he goes on in verse 18,
[1:32:12] "My little children, let us not love in
[1:32:14] word, neither in tongue, but in deed and
[1:32:18] in
[1:32:20] truth. Love one another above
[1:32:22] everything." thing. Brother Brandham
[1:32:23] says, "Love one another." No matter what
[1:32:25] the devil tries to say, he's always
[1:32:28] whispering in your ear. Well, brother so
[1:32:31] and so, he don't like you or this one
[1:32:32] don't like.
[1:32:36] No matter what the devil says, you said
[1:32:38] you you great big sweet group, but
[1:32:40] remember my warning. Satan won't let it
[1:32:42] stay that way. He'll shoot everything if
[1:32:44] he has to bring somebody in and make him
[1:32:46] his target. He'll bring some critic or
[1:32:48] unbeliever in, set him down, and cause
[1:32:49] him to fellowship with you under the
[1:32:51] quietness and things. And then he'll
[1:32:52] shoot that guy some kind of poison
[1:32:54] stuff, and he'll start through the
[1:32:56] church with it. Don't you take sides
[1:32:57] with it.
[1:33:00] Don't you take sides with it. Don't you
[1:33:03] have nothing to do with anything else.
[1:33:04] You stay right, loving, sweet, kind to
[1:33:07] one another. Pray for that man that he
[1:33:09] can be saved or that woman, whoever it
[1:33:11] is. Pray for them. But stick with one
[1:33:13] another and stay with your pastor.
[1:33:19] Give him the
[1:33:27] respects. Oh, the enemy will
[1:33:30] come. He's going to come. He's going to
[1:33:32] tell. But when he does, you cling that
[1:33:34] much closer together.
[1:33:37] The one the devil is using for an enemy
[1:33:39] will either get out or he'll come in.
[1:33:44] Don't ever clan among one another talk
[1:33:46] or make yourself clanish. We are one.
[1:33:50] Left hand. I'm I couldn't say left hand.
[1:33:52] I'm mad at you. I'm going to take you
[1:33:53] away cuz you're not the right hand. No,
[1:33:55] he's my left hand. I want him to stay
[1:33:56] there. I need him. I couldn't say the
[1:33:58] little tip of my finger. I I want you to
[1:34:00] stay right. I I I don't need No, I need
[1:34:03] that little finger. God wants us as a
[1:34:06] body of believers to stay right exactly
[1:34:08] with one another. Right with one
[1:34:10] another. Now understand, amen. We are a
[1:34:12] body. We're the body of Christ, right?
[1:34:15] So, but all not all of us can be the
[1:34:17] right hand or not all of us can be the
[1:34:18] left hand.
[1:34:21] Not all of us can be the ears or the
[1:34:23] mouth or or the, you know, the glorious
[1:34:25] parts.
[1:34:27] Some of us are the unseen parts.
[1:34:30] But we're all important.
[1:34:33] You can't live without your liver. You
[1:34:35] can't live without your kidneys. You
[1:34:36] can't live without your heart.
[1:34:39] [Applause]
[1:34:41] It ain't ever seen. Don't ever pay no
[1:34:43] attention to it unless something goes
[1:34:44] wrong with it. Then you start paying
[1:34:46] attention to it. But boy, you thumb you
[1:34:48] hit that little thumb right there and
[1:34:49] you'll pay attention to that for a long
[1:34:51] time.
[1:34:53] It ain't no saying say something sticks
[1:34:55] out like a sore
[1:34:58] liver. Stick out like a sore
[1:35:01] thumb. But not all of us can be the
[1:35:03] thumb.
[1:35:06] You might feel like and you might be the
[1:35:08] skin on the bottom of the feet, but at
[1:35:10] least you're part of the body.
[1:35:15] And even the skin is important to the
[1:35:17] body.
[1:35:19] How many has had ever had some trouble
[1:35:21] with the skin on your bottom of your
[1:35:22] feet? Get some kind of issue that that
[1:35:24] ain't fun. You can't hardly walk. It
[1:35:25] hurts. You scream. Everything makes your
[1:35:27] whole body go whack. Amen. It's
[1:35:31] important.
[1:35:32] But I can tell you if you feel like that
[1:35:34] this evening that you're just a skin and
[1:35:36] nobody everybody walks on me. Everybody
[1:35:38] don't care about that's who I am. I'm
[1:35:39] just a skin on the bottom of his feet.
[1:35:40] Well, I can tell you this. When that
[1:35:42] body came down
[1:35:44] and he put one foot upon the land and
[1:35:46] one foot upon the sea and you're just a
[1:35:48] skin on the bottom of his feet, every
[1:35:50] devil is still under you.
[1:35:55] I said every devil is still under you.
[1:36:00] Every part is important.
[1:36:03] You may not be the piano player or the
[1:36:05] drum player or the song leader. You may
[1:36:07] not be one of the ministers. You might
[1:36:09] be a prayer warrior in your closet
[1:36:11] calling upon God. We need every part of
[1:36:14] the body.
[1:36:17] Those that are seen and those that are
[1:36:18] unseen.
[1:36:24] The devil's the one that wants to
[1:36:25] minimize you in your part.
[1:36:28] It ain't brother Andrew, brother Ron, or
[1:36:29] anybody else. The devil's whispering in
[1:36:31] your ear. Well, nobody cares. Nobody
[1:36:33] understand. Nobody sees me. Well, he
[1:36:35] sees me. That's all that matters. It
[1:36:38] doesn't really matter if I get man's
[1:36:39] applause or I get somebody patting me on
[1:36:41] the back.
[1:36:44] Who are we? We ain't some hot bed
[1:36:45] planted and we got to be sprayed and we
[1:36:47] got to be tended professional. We got
[1:36:49] That's not who we are. We're certified
[1:36:52] seeds of God for ordained before the
[1:36:55] foundation of the world. There can come
[1:36:57] a drought. There can come a sunshine.
[1:36:59] And it scorched the living to out of us.
[1:37:01] We'll still raise our hands and praise
[1:37:04] God anyhow.
[1:37:09] Make them a storm. It doesn't matter.
[1:37:16] Hallelujah.
[1:37:17] Anyhow, oh, what time? I'm going have to
[1:37:20] hurry.
[1:37:22] He says, "We're in the last
[1:37:24] days where the Bible says we should love
[1:37:28] one another with Christian love and
[1:37:29] divine love to assemble ourselves
[1:37:31] together, even the much more as you see
[1:37:33] that day
[1:37:34] approaching." Listen, I don't care what
[1:37:36] excuse you have on that day, it won't be
[1:37:38] good enough.
[1:37:43] If you happen to be one of those that
[1:37:44] have to stand on the white throne
[1:37:45] judgment, there won't be an excuse one
[1:37:47] that's going to be good enough.
[1:37:50] Amen.
[1:37:56] He says if the brother or some sister
[1:37:59] say done you wrong, say, "Lord, don't
[1:38:02] ever let me have a root of bitterness
[1:38:03] spring up." Amen. Cuz it'll affect my
[1:38:06] life. It'll take Christ right out of it.
[1:38:08] Those poison acids of malice and
[1:38:10] jealousy and hatred, that'll take the
[1:38:12] Holy Spirit right away from you. It'll
[1:38:13] run him from the tabernacle here. Amen.
[1:38:16] It'll kill the spirit of God. a driveway
[1:38:18] to hurt your pastor, do everything.
[1:38:20] Don't do that. Just wax that much closer
[1:38:22] together. Move right up close to one
[1:38:24] another. Love one another. Talk nice
[1:38:25] about one another. Say nice things about
[1:38:27] one another. And then God will bless
[1:38:30] you.
[1:38:32] [Applause]
[1:38:35] Brother Brandon, one
[1:38:38] time come into a restaurant.
[1:38:41] He walks in, he little jukebox playing.
[1:38:44] This woman had her arms around this
[1:38:46] older woman had his arms around a
[1:38:47] policeman. He looks at that and he's
[1:38:50] like, "God, how can you take this? Why
[1:38:52] don't you just strike it all off?"
[1:38:56] God said, "Come, come on, come over
[1:38:58] here. Let me talk to you just a minute."
[1:39:00] He pulls him over into a corner and he
[1:39:02] begins to see a vision of the earth. And
[1:39:04] around the earth was this red stream of
[1:39:06] blood and sins were going up and it was
[1:39:09] hitting that hitting
[1:39:11] it. And he asked him, he said, "Is that
[1:39:13] the world's sins?" He said, "No, that's
[1:39:16] your sins."
[1:39:20] That's kind of choking right there
[1:39:22] because the prophet sins. What about my
[1:39:25] sins?
[1:39:26] What about my mistakes? What about my
[1:39:28] failures?
[1:39:30] And he says he saw him as he reached
[1:39:33] down and it was smacking him and he was
[1:39:34] hitting the body of Jesus and he saw him
[1:39:37] reach down that blood with finger and
[1:39:38] wipe across there forgiven pardon.
[1:39:42] He said now I have forgiven you and yet
[1:39:44] you want to condemn her. Listen, it's
[1:39:47] easy in the world we live in to condemn
[1:39:49] a lot of people.
[1:39:52] It's a good thing we don't have the
[1:39:53] spoken word. That's right. We'd speak a
[1:39:56] lot of them out of existence.
[1:39:59] Come on now. I'm being real.
[1:40:03] You know, there's a pet peeve of mine
[1:40:05] when I'm on the interstate. I can't
[1:40:06] stand nobody in the left lane that's
[1:40:08] just poking around.
[1:40:11] [Applause]
[1:40:13] I can get pretty bitter about that. I
[1:40:15] can get tore up. I can get all mad and
[1:40:17] angry.
[1:40:20] Well, I'm going 70 miles an hour. That's
[1:40:22] the speed limit. That's I can get on a
[1:40:24] tangent on that. I got to stay off
[1:40:27] [Laughter]
[1:40:28] [Music]
[1:40:30] Ah, hallelujah. Anyhow, there's all kind
[1:40:33] of things that we got. Little stuff that
[1:40:35] gets on our nerves.
[1:40:38] Might be different for you. You might be
[1:40:40] the one riding in the left lane. I don't
[1:40:42] know.
[1:40:45] [Applause]
[1:40:47] But I can promise you, it's come over me
[1:40:49] several times. If I had this power of
[1:40:51] the spoken word, this dude would be over
[1:40:53] in Chicago
[1:40:54] somewhere. He'd be wondering what
[1:40:56] happened to me.
[1:41:02] Lord, we hold we see and we see stuff
[1:41:05] that just grieves us and we wonder, God,
[1:41:07] how come you ain't struck this all off?
[1:41:08] And we God, just move it all out of
[1:41:10] here. But he can't because there's a
[1:41:13] stream of blood.
[1:41:17] And I'm thankful for that stream.
[1:41:21] I'm thankful that stream is there
[1:41:23] because I still make mistakes and I
[1:41:25] still have failures. But thank God my
[1:41:27] sins go and he just writes them off.
[1:41:29] Pardon. Pardon. Well, if God's done that
[1:41:31] for you, how can you hold something
[1:41:33] against somebody? How can you allow it
[1:41:35] to sit there and fester? It's time some
[1:41:37] of you dip a finger in the blood of
[1:41:39] Jesus and say, "God, I'm writing pardon
[1:41:42] over that. Forgive it. I'm letting it
[1:41:44] go. I ain't going another service with
[1:41:46] it. I ain't going another moment with
[1:41:48] it, but it's leaving me in Jesus name.
[1:41:57] Some have been dealt really hard cases
[1:41:59] where people have molested them and
[1:42:01] people have done wrong to them. And and
[1:42:02] I'm not saying that they are going to
[1:42:04] get away from it. They or get away with
[1:42:05] it. They're not going to get away with
[1:42:07] it. They are going to pay for their
[1:42:09] transgressions. But if you can say,
[1:42:10] "God, I forgive them. I let it go." You
[1:42:13] will be the one who sets free tonight.
[1:42:16] You'll be the one that chains fall off
[1:42:18] and you can walk away from it and and be
[1:42:21] free in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:42:25] Yes, sir.
[1:42:29] He walked over to that woman. He said,
[1:42:31] "I got something to say to you, ma'am."
[1:42:34] He says, "I was I got apologized." Could
[1:42:36] you
[1:42:38] imagine? I gota apologized about
[1:42:40] something. What's that, sir? He said,
[1:42:42] "Well, I'm a preacher. I I come in here
[1:42:44] and I saw you and that and he said I I I
[1:42:47] started condemning you in my heart. Said
[1:42:49] God dealt with me about it and he said I
[1:42:50] just want to ask you to forgive me.
[1:42:54] You know what that did? It changed
[1:42:56] everything.
[1:42:58] That woman began to say, "Well, you
[1:43:00] know, I once walked with him. I once did
[1:43:02] right, but I I went down the wrong road.
[1:43:04] And I'm asking you right now, will you
[1:43:05] lead me back to him?"
[1:43:08] And he said it turned that little junk
[1:43:10] honky tonk into a prayer meeting room
[1:43:13] and he led them back to the Lord Jesus
[1:43:15] Christ. Listen what happened. It his
[1:43:18] attitude had to change first.
[1:43:21] [Applause]
[1:43:24] Sometimes we get so resentful towards
[1:43:26] God about our children and how things
[1:43:28] have turned out. Listen, your attitude
[1:43:30] has to change first.
[1:43:33] Amen. that God can be merciful and God
[1:43:36] can move. Yes. Amen. But our attitude's
[1:43:38] got to be God. I know I've done all you.
[1:43:40] The devil wants to come over some of
[1:43:41] your parents and say, "Well, if you'd
[1:43:43] have did this and you'd have done that
[1:43:44] and you'd have done this, it'd have been
[1:43:45] a lot different." Maybe so. Maybe you
[1:43:48] did make a lot of mistakes, but there's
[1:43:49] a God that's rich in mercy.
[1:43:52] Amen. There's a God that can override a
[1:43:55] lot of dumb decisions and a lot of dumb
[1:43:57] ideas. Amen. There's a God that can go
[1:43:59] down if you'll just say, "God, I give it
[1:44:02] over to you. I'm not going to be
[1:44:04] resentful about it. I I'm not going to
[1:44:06] have bitterness in my heart about it.
[1:44:07] I'm going to lay it at your feet.
[1:44:17] Mercy.
[1:44:21] He says, and I want to go I want to go
[1:44:24] into one thing before we bring this
[1:44:27] down. I want to turn to 2 Kings 4 and
[1:44:30] verse 8.
[1:44:33] Faith based on
[1:44:39] forgiveness. Let me see if I'm in the
[1:44:41] right place. Yes. Verse eight said, "It
[1:44:46] fell on the day that Elisha passed
[1:44:48] through Shunam. Where was a great
[1:44:51] woman?" Boy, that's amazing, huh?
[1:44:54] Scripture never called her by name, but
[1:44:56] it said who she was. A great woman. and
[1:45:01] she constrained him to eat bread. And so
[1:45:02] it was that often as he passed by, he
[1:45:04] turned in the other to eat bread. She
[1:45:06] said, "Behold now, perceive this man as
[1:45:08] a holy man of God, which passes by us
[1:45:10] continually. Let us make a little
[1:45:12] chamber, I pray thee, and on the wall,
[1:45:14] and let let us set for him there a bed,
[1:45:16] and a table, and a stool, and a
[1:45:18] candlestick, and it shall be that he
[1:45:20] cometh to us, he shall turn in thither."
[1:45:22] And it fell on the day that he came, and
[1:45:24] he turned into the chamber and lay
[1:45:25] there. He said to Gahes, I called the
[1:45:27] Shounomite woman. And when he called
[1:45:29] her, he stood before him and said, "Say
[1:45:31] now unto her, behold, thou has been
[1:45:33] careful for us with all this care, and
[1:45:35] what can be done for you? What is thou
[1:45:36] be what could I speak to the king or the
[1:45:39] captain of the host for you?" She
[1:45:41] answered, "I dwell among my own people."
[1:45:42] And he said, "Well, then it's to be done
[1:45:45] what is to be done." And Gesa answered,
[1:45:46] said, "Verily, she has no child and her
[1:45:49] husband is old." And he said, "Call
[1:45:51] her." And when he called, she stood in
[1:45:53] the door and she said, he said, "About
[1:45:55] this season, according to the time of
[1:45:56] life, thou shalt embrace a son." She
[1:45:59] said, "Name my Lord, thou man of God,
[1:46:01] don't don't lie to him, thy handmade."
[1:46:04] But the woman conceived, see, in spite
[1:46:06] of her doubts,
[1:46:08] "And bear a son at the season that
[1:46:11] Elisha said unto her, according to the
[1:46:13] time of life." And we go on to read the
[1:46:16] story, and it turns into a very tragic
[1:46:18] one for a moment. Yeah. where he's out
[1:46:21] in the field and he grabs his head and
[1:46:23] and he said, "My head, my head." And
[1:46:25] they carried him to the mother and then
[1:46:27] they took him in there and she lay he
[1:46:28] laid on her knees till noon and he died.
[1:46:34] Boy, you're talking about a time that
[1:46:35] you could let bitterness set in.
[1:46:38] He gave me this son and now all of a
[1:46:40] sudden he's gone. Amen.
[1:46:43] He gave me this. I wasn't even I I I
[1:46:47] didn't have no hope of this happening.
[1:46:48] It wasn't my idea. This is a prophet.
[1:46:50] This is a prophet Elisha. He He spoke
[1:46:52] the words. He She could have The devil
[1:46:55] could have got in that moment
[1:46:57] and turned her down the wrong path.
[1:47:02] But she was a great woman.
[1:47:07] And God was going to do great things for
[1:47:09] her if she would keep the right
[1:47:11] attitude.
[1:47:13] And here she goes. She says, "Go get me
[1:47:15] a a donkey. Get me in my saddle. Get it
[1:47:17] all. Get together. I got to go find the
[1:47:18] man of God. And she goes after him. And
[1:47:20] and Elisha sees her coming from a ways
[1:47:22] off. And he sends Eli his servant down
[1:47:24] there and said, "Go ask her, is it well
[1:47:26] with thee? Is it well with thy house? Is
[1:47:28] it well with thy
[1:47:31] son?" Covered it all.
[1:47:35] She could have answered in a in a way
[1:47:37] said, "You know what? Yeah. No, it's not
[1:47:39] well. What are you talking about? I'm
[1:47:40] coming here because he
[1:47:42] died. You gave him to him. Now he's
[1:47:44] gone." No, that wasn't her response. She
[1:47:46] said, "It is well."
[1:47:51] It is well. It was it was faith that had
[1:47:53] led her to that place
[1:47:56] and she didn't allow bitterness to
[1:47:58] accumulate or unforgiveness or or some
[1:48:00] root there to start growing and she
[1:48:02] could have become angry and all these
[1:48:04] things could have been built and it
[1:48:05] could accumulate. But no, she kept all
[1:48:07] of that clean to where she could
[1:48:09] respond. It is well
[1:48:12] in my eyes. It may not look well, but it
[1:48:14] doesn't matter what I can say. It
[1:48:16] matters what you say.
[1:48:19] Hallelujah.
[1:48:26] And he goes and we know the story when
[1:48:28] and the Lord brought him back to life.
[1:48:30] But the story don't end there. 2 Kings 8
[1:48:33] and verse one. Then spake Elisha unto
[1:48:36] the woman whose son he restored to life,
[1:48:38] saying, "Arise, and go in thine
[1:48:40] household, and sojourn whatsoever thou
[1:48:42] can sojourn. For the Lord has called a
[1:48:44] famine, and it shall also come upon the
[1:48:47] land seven years." Notice seven years.
[1:48:49] And the woman arose, and did after the
[1:48:51] saying of the man of God, and she went
[1:48:52] with her household, and sojourned in the
[1:48:54] land of the Philistines, seven years.
[1:48:56] And it came to pass at the seven years
[1:48:58] end that the woman returned out of the
[1:49:00] land of the Philistines, she went forth
[1:49:02] to cry unto the king for her house and
[1:49:05] for her land. Yes. Okay. To be restored.
[1:49:08] And the king talking was talking with
[1:49:10] Gaze of the servant, the man of God,
[1:49:11] saying, "Tell me, I pray thee, all the
[1:49:14] great things that Elisha has done." And
[1:49:16] it came to pass as he was telling the
[1:49:18] king how he restored a dead body to
[1:49:20] life, that behold, the very woman whose
[1:49:23] son he had restored to life, cried to
[1:49:25] the king for a house and for her land.
[1:49:27] And the servant said, "Oh king, this is
[1:49:29] the woman, this is her son whom Elisha
[1:49:32] restored to life." Now, what would have
[1:49:34] happened if she'd allowed bitterness to
[1:49:37] come into her heart?
[1:49:40] Come on, buddy. what had allow happened
[1:49:41] to her if she'd allowed unforgiveness to
[1:49:43] come and that son would have just been
[1:49:45] buried and now gone seven years. But
[1:49:49] because she allowed herself to stay
[1:49:51] clean of all of that and God restored
[1:49:53] her son when it came time to restore
[1:49:55] everything else.
[1:50:00] Hallelujah. Oh, glory to God. I'm
[1:50:02] looking at another woman tonight. Amen.
[1:50:04] a woman that's been coming up through
[1:50:06] seven church ages,
[1:50:09] but we are in the time of the
[1:50:11] restoration of all things. And we're not
[1:50:14] standing here by oursel. It's not our
[1:50:16] own testimony. It's not who we are.
[1:50:19] There's a son standing by us.
[1:50:23] Hallelujah. Why? Because we have kept
[1:50:24] bitterness out of our heart and we kept
[1:50:26] unbelief out of our heart. And God will
[1:50:29] restore everything the devil took from
[1:50:31] you.
[1:50:34] Hallelujah. You might have been in a
[1:50:36] famine. You might have feel like you
[1:50:38] hadn't felt a move in a spirit in a long
[1:50:40] time. But if you'll keep your heart
[1:50:42] clean and you'll keep your mind pure and
[1:50:44] you'll keep your thoughts on Jesus
[1:50:46] Christ. Amen. He will produce something
[1:50:48] in your life that'll restore everything
[1:50:51] back to you.
[1:50:53] Woo. Hallelujah. I'm looking at a church
[1:50:56] that the what palmer worm and the locust
[1:50:58] worm, everything is stripped off, but
[1:51:01] the life of Jesus Christ has come back
[1:51:03] into her again.
[1:51:07] And now we can cry for our sons. We can
[1:51:09] cry for our daughters. We can cry for
[1:51:12] every promise.
[1:51:15] Everything in the famine has took off
[1:51:17] and and the worms have destroyed. We can
[1:51:19] stand in our promised land and say, "I
[1:51:22] want it all back.
[1:51:25] Hallelujah. I want my inheritance back.
[1:51:28] I want what God gave me back. I'm not
[1:51:30] leaving a hoof behind, but I'm walking
[1:51:33] out of here in the presence of almighty
[1:51:35] God.
[1:51:39] Amen. And the king appointed to her
[1:51:41] certain officer and said, "Restore all
[1:51:44] that was hers."
[1:51:47] Woo. Hallelujah. and all the fruits of
[1:51:50] the field since the day she left the
[1:51:53] land until now.
[1:51:58] Listen, it wasn't just her land she got
[1:52:00] back, just her house she got back. She
[1:52:03] got every fruit that was bore while she
[1:52:05] was gone. That's right.
[1:52:10] Every grape, every
[1:52:13] olive, every one of them that was taken
[1:52:16] from that land was given back. Why?
[1:52:20] Because she had the son.
[1:52:27] Why can we stand on the word of God and
[1:52:29] proclaim the liberties of Jesus Christ
[1:52:32] and demand the devil to give everything
[1:52:34] that we own back? Why can we do that?
[1:52:36] Because we have the son.
[1:52:41] His life living on the inside of us is
[1:52:44] the reason we can stand upon the word
[1:52:46] and speak to our mountain.
[1:52:49] That's why the devil wants to come and
[1:52:51] cram bitterness down and unforgiveness
[1:52:53] down and every kind of other thing,
[1:52:55] resentments down your throat and down
[1:52:56] into your heart. Why? Because he's
[1:52:58] trying to keep that that power from
[1:53:01] coming on the inside of you.
[1:53:04] That's why we That's why I'm I'm
[1:53:05] preaching this tonight because I want
[1:53:06] you to understand one thing. Amen. You
[1:53:08] we always say, "Well, we got the Holy
[1:53:09] Ghost. We got the What is the Holy Ghost
[1:53:11] doing in your life?
[1:53:15] How is it operating?
[1:53:18] How's the rubber really hitting the
[1:53:20] road?"
[1:53:25] I wonder how many can say tonight, Lord,
[1:53:27] I I want to examine myself by your
[1:53:31] word. If there be any wicked way in
[1:53:34] me, I want it to be cut out of my life.
[1:53:38] If I have any little alt in my heart,
[1:53:41] Lord, just come down with your word and
[1:53:43] just let let me just uh you know, like
[1:53:46] that woman, you know, we're like
[1:53:47] sometimes like that woman that, you
[1:53:49] know, invited invited the guest. She
[1:53:51] didn't realize it was the Lord Jesus
[1:53:53] come to her li her home and she would
[1:53:55] open up certain doors. Oh, don't go in
[1:53:57] that door. No, don't go in. Why? She had
[1:53:59] hid all those things in there. Listen,
[1:54:01] we need to open up every door of our
[1:54:03] heart.
[1:54:06] Can we do that tonight? Music, musicians
[1:54:08] can come. Can we do that tonight? Can we
[1:54:10] open up every door?
[1:54:14] Maybe most services you open up three,
[1:54:17] maybe you open up two, maybe one, but
[1:54:19] tonight, can you open up every door?
[1:54:22] Every closet,
[1:54:24] well, there's a lot of skeletons in
[1:54:25] there. Well, let's have a house
[1:54:26] cleaning.
[1:54:29] Let's get them out. Well, there's some
[1:54:32] some malt over there, brother. I don't I
[1:54:33] I I can't I just can't let let it go.
[1:54:38] There's nothing worth staying here for.
[1:54:44] You're not going to leave with that
[1:54:45] bitterness. You're not going to leave
[1:54:46] with that unforgiveness. It ain't going
[1:54:49] to just magically drop off of you on
[1:54:50] rapture day. No, it's going to come now
[1:54:53] when you take the word and say, "God,
[1:54:54] I'm sick of this thing holding my life.
[1:54:57] I'm sick of this thing guiding me and
[1:54:59] leading me in my emotional realms and my
[1:55:02] spiritual life. And I I allow it. I
[1:55:03] can't get the freedom I want. I can't
[1:55:05] get the deliverance because I it always
[1:55:07] goes back. What about this? What about
[1:55:09] that? What about what this said? What
[1:55:10] about that said? Tonight's the night.
[1:55:12] It's all coming out.
[1:55:16] Come on, somebody. You know you need
[1:55:18] more than what you got.
[1:55:21] You know you need more than what you
[1:55:23] need more than just some emotional
[1:55:25] thing. We need the power of a Pentecost
[1:55:27] that came down and it changed Peter from
[1:55:30] a cussing preacher into a son of God
[1:55:32] that he could walk down the streets of
[1:55:34] Jerusalem and preach without fear,
[1:55:36] without favor, and 3,000 souls would
[1:55:39] come to God.
[1:55:41] Amen. He might not come in you and make
[1:55:43] you a preacher, but he'll come in you
[1:55:44] and make you a Christian. He'll make you
[1:55:46] a good person, a good worker, a good
[1:55:48] boss man that knows how to treat people.
[1:55:51] He'll make you a good man that knows how
[1:55:53] to treat your wife. He'll make you a
[1:55:55] good wife that knows how to treat your
[1:55:56] husband. He'll make you good parents and
[1:55:59] know how to treat your children. He'll
[1:56:00] make you good children know how to treat
[1:56:02] your parents.
[1:56:05] Hallelujah. This is what we
[1:56:07] [Applause]
[1:56:10] [Music]
[1:56:12] need. Let's buy our hearts.
[1:56:18] [Music]
[1:56:22] I don't
[1:56:23] know. Let's have a good soul searching
[1:56:26] time
[1:56:28] tonight. Lord, if there be any darkness
[1:56:30] in
[1:56:32] me, there be anything, Lord, that I've
[1:56:37] held, let me let it
[1:56:39] go. Some of you kids are hold resentment
[1:56:42] toward your parents. It's time to let it
[1:56:44] go.
[1:56:45] [Music]
[1:56:48] Some of you has held resentment towards
[1:56:50] your mom and dad. Older people even is
[1:56:53] still mad at your mom and dad about
[1:56:54] something. It's time to let it
[1:56:57] go. Well, I just didn't like the way
[1:56:59] Brother Ron preached last Sunday. It's
[1:57:01] time to let it
[1:57:01] [Music]
[1:57:04] go. Lay it
[1:57:07] down. But God, I cleanse my heart. Oh
[1:57:10] God, make me more like you.
[1:57:14] [Music]
[1:57:17] Maybe we just have an old fashioned
[1:57:18] altar service
[1:57:21] tonight. If you know down in your heart
[1:57:23] that you need more of God, I invite you
[1:57:25] here
[1:57:26] tonight. I want more of
[1:57:29] him. I got some spots, Brother Timothy,
[1:57:31] I want to I want to just get the bristle
[1:57:34] of the word and just scrub it
[1:57:37] out. Got some places I just need to lay
[1:57:41] open before him. Me, just me and Jesus.
[1:57:44] It's me and Jesus.
[1:57:46] [Music]
[1:57:49] It's me too,
[1:57:51] Lord. It's me too,
[1:57:53] [Music]
[1:57:58] Lord. Father, you see it tonight, Lord.
[1:58:01] I I would struggle just to come to this
[1:58:04] moment, Lord, but just seeing it being
[1:58:06] orchestrated the spirit of God.
[1:58:08] [Music]
[1:58:10] Lord, I I've laid it out there as best
[1:58:12] as I can and my heart just not easy
[1:58:15] sometimes to preach things like this,
[1:58:18] but Lord, we just want to be sensitive
[1:58:20] to you and how you like to operate,
[1:58:23] Lord.
[1:58:25] Lord, we just ask now that Lord, as
[1:58:26] people open their hearts, that Lord, to
[1:58:29] you as a gentleman just come down and
[1:58:30] walk through every closet, that they
[1:58:32] open every
[1:58:34] place. Lord, it might be a struggle for
[1:58:36] a moment, but they'll realize they're
[1:58:39] giving up a lot less than what they're
[1:58:41] getting. Lord, they can let that
[1:58:43] bitterness to go and receive the love of
[1:58:45] God in their heart. They're getting so
[1:58:46] much
[1:58:47] more real fruit, pleasant to the eyes of
[1:58:51] Almighty God.
[1:58:53] Now, Satan, you and your bitterness and
[1:58:55] you and your resentment and
[1:58:56] unforgiveness, I curse you in the name
[1:58:59] of Jesus
[1:59:02] Christ. In the name of the Lord, you
[1:59:04] leave this building and these
[1:59:06] people. Lord, let the love, the perfect
[1:59:09] love of God just flow through here,
[1:59:11] Lord, flow through every heart and wash
[1:59:14] us, Lord, tonight. Wash every channel.
[1:59:17] Wash every place, Lord. If we've been
[1:59:20] bitter towards you about something,
[1:59:21] forgive us, Father.
[1:59:24] We've allowed things to build up and we
[1:59:26] allow things that we carry for years and
[1:59:29] generations. Lord, if we ain't careful,
[1:59:30] we'll pass them on to the next
[1:59:32] generation. But Lord, may there be
[1:59:34] somebody here tonight said, "I'm going
[1:59:35] to break the cycle. I I'm not carrying
[1:59:37] it on to the next one. I I'm laying it
[1:59:40] at Jesus'
[1:59:41] feet. It stops with
[1:59:44] me." Jesus name we pray.
[1:59:48] Lord, we commit this to you Lord for
[1:59:51] your glory and for your
[1:59:53] honor in Jesus
[1:59:55] name.
[1:59:58] Amen. Hallelujah.
