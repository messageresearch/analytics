[57:47] your way over in the book of ezekiel
[57:49] we'd like to read a
[57:50] quote and i asked the brothers to put it
[57:53] up on the
[57:54] the board for you from the great the
[57:57] great warrior joshua
[57:59] here brother branham said now
[58:01] supernaturally now the body
[58:03] of the lord jesus is the shadow
[58:06] as it was of the natural physical body
[58:09] of the lord
[58:09] and notice if healings if powers if
[58:13] visions
[58:15] if the things that that christ had in
[58:17] him
[58:18] has gone out of his shadow then christ
[58:20] is paralyzed
[58:22] his natural body sits paralyzed because
[58:24] that if his physical body moves his
[58:27] shadow will have to move with it and if
[58:30] we are
[58:31] in christ by holy ghost baptism
[58:34] and the way the body of christ moves
[58:37] it'll move the same way
[58:39] on earth for this is a shadow
[58:42] of his body amen always been in
[58:45] figurative types and it is tonight the
[58:48] body of the lord jesus christ now
[58:50] now taken it out of things of the world
[58:53] speaking of you
[58:54] predestinated by god called of god
[58:57] elected of god chosen of god saved by
[59:00] god
[59:01] baptized in the body of christ by the
[59:03] holy spirit
[59:04] and made members of this body can you
[59:07] identify yourself
[59:09] alive ready willing my shadow will move
[59:13] every time anything of my body moves and
[59:16] the holy spirit
[59:18] body of christ will move just as christ
[59:21] moves and if christ in heaven can ever
[59:24] get his physical
[59:26] body or his spiritual body on earth
[59:28] moving
[59:29] as he wants it to move watch for things
[59:32] to happen if he can ever get
[59:36] his spiritual body on earth moving as he
[59:39] wants it to move
[59:40] watch for things to happen i'd say
[59:42] though that we're watching those things
[59:44] take place it's beginning to come to
[59:47] life
[59:47] they've paralyzed it long enough but the
[59:49] holy spirit is bringing life into it
[59:52] and it's begin to wake up and begin to
[59:55] move
[59:56] because it sees its position
[59:59] amen ezekiel chapter 36 and verse 22
[1:00:02] and the bible says here therefore say
[1:00:06] unto the house of israel
[1:00:08] thus saith the lord god i do not this
[1:00:10] for your sake notice i do not this
[1:00:12] for your sake o house of israel but for
[1:00:15] my holy name's sake
[1:00:17] which you have profaned among the
[1:00:19] heathen whether you went
[1:00:21] now if you look at that word shalom in
[1:00:23] in the hebrew profane it means to bore
[1:00:26] it means by implication to wound or dis
[1:00:29] dissolve
[1:00:30] figuratively to profane a person
[1:00:33] a place or a thing it means to break
[1:00:36] one's word
[1:00:37] to begin as if by opening a wedge
[1:00:40] it means to defile which you have
[1:00:43] defiled
[1:00:44] among the heathen whether you went
[1:00:46] notice what they went there
[1:00:48] in verse 23 and i will sanctify my great
[1:00:51] name
[1:00:52] which was profaned among the heathen
[1:00:54] which ye have profaned
[1:00:56] in the midst of them and the heathen
[1:00:58] shall know that i
[1:00:59] am the lord saith the lord god when i
[1:01:01] shall be sanctified in you before their
[1:01:04] eyes
[1:01:04] for i will take you from among the
[1:01:06] heathen and gather you out of all the
[1:01:08] countries
[1:01:09] and i will bring you into your own land
[1:01:12] then will i sprinkle clean water upon
[1:01:15] you and you shall be clean from all your
[1:01:17] filthiness and from all your idols
[1:01:19] will i cleanse you a new heart also will
[1:01:22] i give you and a new spirit will i put
[1:01:24] within you
[1:01:25] and i will take away the stony heart out
[1:01:28] of your flesh and i will give you and
[1:01:30] heart of flesh and i will put my spirit
[1:01:33] within you
[1:01:34] and cause you to walk in my statutes and
[1:01:37] you shall keep my judgments and do them
[1:01:40] and you shall dwell in that in the land
[1:01:42] that i gave to your fathers
[1:01:44] and you shall be my people and i will be
[1:01:48] your god
[1:01:49] may god bless his word he may be seated
[1:01:50] in the presence of the lord
[1:01:52] now we know that that god always deals
[1:01:56] with
[1:01:56] with israel as as a church but he deals
[1:02:00] with the gentiles as in individuals
[1:02:02] and we know that the bible has said it
[1:02:05] throughout the scriptures that
[1:02:06] that we are a chosen generation and you
[1:02:09] can find that
[1:02:10] that jesus himself would even say that
[1:02:12] you have not chosen me but i have chosen
[1:02:15] you
[1:02:15] and we realize that even peter would say
[1:02:18] that we are a chosen
[1:02:20] generation a royal priesthood a holy
[1:02:23] nation a peculiar people
[1:02:26] that we would show forth the praise of
[1:02:28] him who hath called us
[1:02:29] out of darkness into this marvelous
[1:02:32] light
[1:02:33] and god god had foreordained
[1:02:36] a people that would be called by his
[1:02:39] namesake and
[1:02:40] god has always dealt with himself and
[1:02:43] spoke of himself
[1:02:44] as the bridegroom and his church as the
[1:02:47] bride and jehovah
[1:02:49] had a bride and you go to look
[1:02:50] throughout the scriptures and you can
[1:02:52] see how that
[1:02:53] how that israel had always had always
[1:02:55] longed after god but then after a
[1:02:57] certain season
[1:02:58] that they would they were their heart
[1:03:00] would go adrift and they would go a
[1:03:02] whoring off after
[1:03:03] after different lovers and and you can
[1:03:05] find that even solomon himself that
[1:03:07] when he began to get acquainted with
[1:03:09] other wives from different countries
[1:03:11] that his heart was turned away from god
[1:03:14] not like his father david
[1:03:16] and his heart was solely and wholly
[1:03:19] placed upon god but solomon
[1:03:21] because he invited in idolatry and
[1:03:23] invited in idolater
[1:03:25] uh wives and then incorporated their
[1:03:27] worship into his worship
[1:03:29] they begin to after after the
[1:03:31] other powers of the world
[1:03:33] and even brother branham would say that
[1:03:35] christ's bride and he referring to the
[1:03:37] church has done the same thing
[1:03:40] that they went a whoring after other
[1:03:42] powers when they
[1:03:43] he said when they they just couldn't
[1:03:45] wait he said so they had to manufacture
[1:03:47] something
[1:03:48] he said they just couldn't wait for the
[1:03:50] holy spirit to come and get into the
[1:03:53] church
[1:03:53] and then when he was referring to the
[1:03:55] pentecostal dispensation or the
[1:03:57] pentecostal church or
[1:03:58] denomination he said that if they would
[1:04:01] have remained
[1:04:02] he said they would have been a blood
[1:04:04] washed people they'd have had the power
[1:04:06] in them they would have been
[1:04:07] shaking they they'd have been the world
[1:04:10] would have been shaking under her
[1:04:11] tremendous
[1:04:12] impact of the word being flesh and being
[1:04:16] spoken word by word and we realize that
[1:04:19] that whenever you see a reforming
[1:04:22] of denomination you begin to watch as a
[1:04:24] move of a
[1:04:25] move of the spirit of god that men will
[1:04:28] men will denominate it but this message
[1:04:30] has never been denominated and it's been
[1:04:32] going on
[1:04:34] and you'll watch that that after after a
[1:04:36] revival that twins are born
[1:04:39] and you'll watch that there's a jacob
[1:04:41] and an esau in every revival
[1:04:43] and i realize who i am speaking to
[1:04:45] tonight and because
[1:04:47] because of who you are is because the
[1:04:49] message came by your way
[1:04:52] and you see you see you didn't choose
[1:04:54] yourself
[1:04:55] he chose you before the foundation of
[1:04:57] the world
[1:04:58] but you watch every time throughout a
[1:05:00] reformation
[1:05:01] down through the ages that are reforming
[1:05:03] always produces
[1:05:05] a carnal impersonation but the body of
[1:05:08] the living god
[1:05:10] cannot move by carnality it's got to
[1:05:13] move
[1:05:14] by the spirit and notice what he says
[1:05:16] over in the book of ezekiel
[1:05:18] that i will sanctify my great name no
[1:05:21] notice that god is saying that that i
[1:05:24] will vindicate
[1:05:25] my name his name was great through all
[1:05:27] of their sin
[1:05:28] his name was great he did not change he
[1:05:31] did not waver
[1:05:32] but because of his name in a land
[1:05:36] where people had forgot about him and
[1:05:38] talked
[1:05:39] and talked about him and moved past
[1:05:42] moved
[1:05:42] past the gods that brought them out of
[1:05:44] egypt and they went down and went
[1:05:46] whoring after other things notice how
[1:05:49] powerful
[1:05:50] god is that god is saying in spite of
[1:05:53] all in all of your sin in spite of all
[1:05:57] of your mistakes
[1:05:58] i'm not going to allow your mistakes to
[1:06:00] hinder my name
[1:06:01] i'm not going to allow your sin i'm not
[1:06:04] gonna do allow the things that you go
[1:06:06] whoring after to hinder my great name
[1:06:09] but i will vindicate my name
[1:06:11] i will come behind my name and i will
[1:06:13] bring
[1:06:14] about what i am through my name
[1:06:19] are you with me you see god will never
[1:06:21] allow
[1:06:22] thou men to defile his great name
[1:06:28] are you with me this evening
[1:06:31] but you see men always seem to go
[1:06:35] after carnal impersonations and
[1:06:37] especially pentecostal people
[1:06:39] when they begin to watch when the spirit
[1:06:41] of the living god goes to moving on
[1:06:43] people
[1:06:44] you watch you can watch that that
[1:06:46] pentecost always goes after gifts
[1:06:49] they're always looking after signs
[1:06:50] they're always looking after something
[1:06:52] that they've seen on a wall or looking
[1:06:54] after some sign that they seen in heaven
[1:06:56] now i believe that those things are
[1:06:57] there for the believers but it'll be a
[1:06:59] pentecostal bait
[1:07:00] when they'll jump on those sayings and
[1:07:02] they'll jump on those things and they'll
[1:07:04] miss what the word says
[1:07:06] and men will go after carnality and
[1:07:08] they'll go after something
[1:07:10] and not realize that they're worshiping
[1:07:12] a false god when they went off
[1:07:14] and left the word but notice whenever
[1:07:17] god moves
[1:07:18] god has a purpose in his move that god
[1:07:21] is always backing up a move
[1:07:23] by his word because he is the word
[1:07:28] you see god is not like you and i as
[1:07:30] mortals
[1:07:31] we have vision where we can only go as
[1:07:33] far as we can see
[1:07:35] but god goes further than what he can
[1:07:37] see
[1:07:38] because god has a long-range vision and
[1:07:41] when god moves
[1:07:43] god is after something when god moves
[1:07:45] he's after someone
[1:07:47] and maybe you don't understand why he's
[1:07:49] moving necessarily in the midst of
[1:07:51] of you right now maybe you don't
[1:07:53] understand why he's moving on a people
[1:07:55] in the sense that he's moving in maybe
[1:07:58] you don't understand
[1:07:59] why god is pouring out a spirit like he
[1:08:02] is in this hour
[1:08:03] but you realize that if god is doing
[1:08:06] something now
[1:08:07] he's got something in the future that's
[1:08:09] coming
[1:08:11] and i happen to believe that there is a
[1:08:13] young people
[1:08:14] that is birthed by the word that's
[1:08:16] setting here and maybe you don't
[1:08:18] understand
[1:08:19] the move of the holy spirit in the young
[1:08:21] people like you're seeing it
[1:08:23] but i happen to believe that they are
[1:08:25] the future of this church
[1:08:27] i happen to believe that they are not
[1:08:29] the church of tomorrow
[1:08:30] but they are the church of today
[1:08:34] and maybe you don't understand
[1:08:36] everything that's going on but you just
[1:08:38] hang on because god is already in our
[1:08:40] future
[1:08:42] hallelujah god was already in 2021
[1:08:46] when brother homer fraser started the
[1:08:48] church in 1974
[1:08:50] he was already here we're just catching
[1:08:53] up to his vision
[1:08:54] but the vision said that you would be
[1:08:57] here
[1:08:57] [Music]
[1:08:57] [Applause]
[1:08:59] hallelujah when it started out in a
[1:09:01] little church down in the basement
[1:09:03] then moved up to summit avenue then
[1:09:05] moved up here
[1:09:06] and you watch what god was doing he was
[1:09:09] moving a people
[1:09:11] into his vision
[1:09:15] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:09:19] see when he moves he's got a purpose in
[1:09:21] it he's looking after somebody and i
[1:09:24] happen to believe that he's got
[1:09:26] he's got men of god preaching the word
[1:09:28] of the god
[1:09:29] word of almighty god going after young
[1:09:31] people
[1:09:32] going after certain situations going
[1:09:35] after certain things because god has got
[1:09:37] long-range vision
[1:09:38] maybe you can't see your loved one
[1:09:40] sitting beside you but god's got
[1:09:42] long-range vision
[1:09:43] maybe you can't see yourself in a
[1:09:45] perfect body but god's got long-range
[1:09:47] vision
[1:09:48] maybe you can't see yourself in victory
[1:09:50] but god's got long-range vision
[1:09:52] maybe you can't see yourself in a body
[1:09:55] change but god's got long-range vision
[1:09:57] maybe you can't see yourself dancing
[1:09:59] down here but god's got long-range
[1:10:01] vision
[1:10:02] he realizes that if you're going to be
[1:10:04] dancing over there
[1:10:06] you're going to have to do a little
[1:10:07] dancing over here god's got long-range
[1:10:10] vision
[1:10:10] and he sees past what you don't see
[1:10:16] hallelujah you see notice that when god
[1:10:19] saying that i
[1:10:21] i will i will sanctify my name
[1:10:24] he is saying i'm gonna restore honor to
[1:10:27] my name
[1:10:28] but notice that when god goes to doing
[1:10:30] something he's got a twofold purpose in
[1:10:32] doing this here
[1:10:34] notice he's saying i'm gonna restore
[1:10:36] honor to my name
[1:10:37] but now i'm not gonna leave you out of
[1:10:38] the picture when i restore honor to my
[1:10:41] name
[1:10:41] i'm gonna restore you at the same time
[1:10:46] oh hallelujah i just dumped off a big
[1:10:49] old load
[1:10:50] to you this evening you see god is not
[1:10:53] just worried about
[1:10:54] what was going on and getting back his
[1:10:57] name down through the
[1:10:58] down through the dark ages all that was
[1:11:00] lost
[1:11:02] he is bringing about in a restoration in
[1:11:04] this hour
[1:11:05] that which was lost in the dark ages and
[1:11:08] all of those loose sins that hadn't been
[1:11:09] tied up
[1:11:10] and now living in an hour when the
[1:11:13] things have been restored back
[1:11:17] you see when god restores he is placing
[1:11:19] the body
[1:11:20] back in its rightful position brother
[1:11:23] random said and united under one head he
[1:11:25] said when god moves
[1:11:28] in the spirit his children move with it
[1:11:32] you see sometimes people get they get
[1:11:35] complacent
[1:11:36] or they sympathize with a message and
[1:11:38] they sit still
[1:11:40] and think well i've gone as far as i'm
[1:11:42] gonna go if you don't move with the
[1:11:44] spirit
[1:11:45] the spirit will leave you where you're
[1:11:47] sitting at
[1:11:48] some people are okay with the with the
[1:11:51] experience they had 40 years ago
[1:11:54] let me say this there are some people
[1:11:56] that would be satisfied
[1:11:58] with the experience they got on summit
[1:12:00] avenue
[1:12:02] there are people that are satisfied with
[1:12:04] the moving of the holy spirit
[1:12:06] in 1991 when they created this church
[1:12:09] and built a place but i don't happen to
[1:12:12] believe
[1:12:12] that the bride of jesus christ is happy
[1:12:15] or
[1:12:16] sympathizing or complacent in the place
[1:12:18] that she's at
[1:12:21] but she moves when the spirit moves
[1:12:28] all right he said i will restore
[1:12:33] and i will sanctify my great name and
[1:12:36] i'm going to do it in such a way
[1:12:37] that the heathen may see how holy
[1:12:41] that i am now i happen to absolutely
[1:12:44] love that
[1:12:45] that not only does god allow himself
[1:12:48] to go into a spot that his elect see
[1:12:51] how great he is but he makes his enemies
[1:12:54] see how great he is when you go to
[1:12:57] thinking about
[1:12:58] who christ is and and what christ is you
[1:13:01] can look out through the prophets
[1:13:03] and you can see what they thought christ
[1:13:05] was or what the messiah was
[1:13:07] you can see you can see what jerry has
[1:13:09] thought of him
[1:13:10] you could see what lazarus thought of
[1:13:12] him you could see what paul thought of
[1:13:14] him
[1:13:14] you could see what peter thought of him
[1:13:16] but what about when the enemy goes to
[1:13:18] testify
[1:13:19] of how great he is
[1:13:22] you know that the bible said let's just
[1:13:25] look at what the enemy said about our
[1:13:27] god
[1:13:28] that when he when he come against demons
[1:13:30] in the day of jesus
[1:13:32] when he come against him he said why
[1:13:34] those demons screamed out
[1:13:36] thou son of god why torment us thou us
[1:13:39] before our time you see they recognize
[1:13:42] who he was and they recognized that they
[1:13:45] had a future of torment
[1:13:47] so they recognized that he was the son
[1:13:50] of god
[1:13:51] when the roman centurion when he pierced
[1:13:53] when he pierced his side
[1:13:55] he truly looked on him and said truly
[1:13:58] this was the son of god judas issachara
[1:14:02] when he when he come to a spot he said i
[1:14:04] have
[1:14:05] betrayed innocent blood when you look at
[1:14:08] pilate when pilate is standing there in
[1:14:11] the judgment hall
[1:14:12] and he comes to him an inscription comes
[1:14:14] to him
[1:14:15] of his wife and she tells him don't you
[1:14:17] have nothing to do with this man named
[1:14:19] jesus
[1:14:20] i have been troubled all throughout the
[1:14:22] night time
[1:14:23] because of this man and pilate went and
[1:14:26] washed his hands in waters
[1:14:28] and said i can find no fault in this man
[1:14:32] you realize that the enemy recognized
[1:14:35] that there was no fault in jesus
[1:14:39] now some of the church world can't
[1:14:41] recognize that there's no fault in jesus
[1:14:43] but do you recognize that if you are
[1:14:46] identified in him there
[1:14:50] is no fault in a perfect bride
[1:14:54] a perfect body that is moving in
[1:14:56] operation
[1:14:57] to the holy spirit
[1:14:59] [Applause]
[1:15:01] all blessed be the name of the lord
[1:15:04] the god of abraham still lives
[1:15:07] the god of moses still lives he said i
[1:15:10] am
[1:15:10] that i am and he's still here the god of
[1:15:14] ezekiel is here
[1:15:15] the god of elijah's here
[1:15:18] [Applause]
[1:15:20] the god of william branham is right here
[1:15:25] and he's operating in a body
[1:15:29] now notice that when when god says when
[1:15:32] he begin to look over in verse 25
[1:15:34] that you begin to watch that that that
[1:15:36] the change of god
[1:15:38] that is coming upon the people that
[1:15:40] notice that when god changes you
[1:15:42] it isn't superficial
[1:15:46] it ain't just torn a surface but it is
[1:15:48] strictly
[1:15:49] based upon the renewing of the heart
[1:15:52] god was getting ready to show the
[1:15:55] heathen that he was bigger than humanity
[1:15:58] and his plan would not be stopped by
[1:16:00] silly
[1:16:01] human mistakes by going a whoring off
[1:16:04] after a dollar tree
[1:16:05] and after false gods and when the
[1:16:08] heathens
[1:16:09] would see the time of restoration they
[1:16:11] would see
[1:16:12] how holy our god is
[1:16:16] brother brandon would take that tight
[1:16:18] and he would talk about that watch
[1:16:20] that watch getting put over in a pawn
[1:16:22] shop he said now he said now if you took
[1:16:24] a watch and
[1:16:25] you took this watch and put it down in
[1:16:26] the pawn shop and he said
[1:16:28] he said if you would take that watch and
[1:16:30] put it down that pawn shop and you tell
[1:16:32] me that you went and paid for that so
[1:16:34] that i could get it out of the pawn shop
[1:16:36] he said it would do me no good to go
[1:16:38] down there and try to pay for that watch
[1:16:40] he said because it had already been paid
[1:16:43] for
[1:16:44] you see that watch was built to be
[1:16:46] placed on a hand
[1:16:47] and it would be built to be an operation
[1:16:51] on a man's hand but something happened
[1:16:53] that caused it
[1:16:54] to go into the pawn shop and brother
[1:16:57] madam would use that as a type
[1:16:59] that you and i were put into a pawn shop
[1:17:01] and
[1:17:02] because of adam's sin and because of
[1:17:04] adam's sin we were put in the pawn shot
[1:17:06] the devil put us there but jesus came
[1:17:09] and paid and left a receipt that you
[1:17:12] don't have to pay for your sin
[1:17:14] that i have already paid for it and when
[1:17:17] you
[1:17:17] look at that you can see the receipt of
[1:17:20] the blood trail
[1:17:23] that satan has to take his hands off of
[1:17:26] god's property
[1:17:27] and you can say with the full authority
[1:17:30] i got a right to these promises
[1:17:32] i got a right to the holy ghost i got a
[1:17:34] right to a fresh revival
[1:17:36] i got a right to a move i gotta write to
[1:17:40] my young people

[1:17:43] write to my family
[1:17:45] satan take your hands off i'm looking at
[1:17:48] the blood trail
[1:17:49] the blood trail tells me that he walked
[1:17:52] up calvary's hill
[1:17:54] the blood trail tells me that he went
[1:17:56] down to a belly of hell
[1:18:01] oh satan you can't cross the bloodline
[1:18:04] [Applause]
[1:18:07] satan tried to tell you you're going to
[1:18:08] have to live with that sickness all your
[1:18:10] life but you've got a right to a healing
[1:18:13] satan will try to tell you you're gonna
[1:18:14] have to deal with those symptoms but
[1:18:16] you've got a right to get over those
[1:18:17] symptoms
[1:18:19] you remember you remember what the
[1:18:20] prophet said said satan kept coming to
[1:18:22] him

[1:18:36] he said i'll make you sick and i begin
[1:18:38] to testify
[1:18:39] that much more he said if you want to
[1:18:42] hear me praise god
[1:18:44] you might as well stick around here for
[1:18:46] a little while
[1:18:46] [Applause]
[1:18:48] he said even in my sickness i kept on
[1:18:51] praising him
[1:18:52] because he had a receipt
[1:18:57] [Applause]
[1:18:58] hallelujah hallelujah i got a receipt

[1:19:40] got on his own slew foot
[1:19:42] and went back down the street faster
[1:19:44] than he came up there
[1:19:46] what was it because he had a receipt

[1:20:30] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[1:20:32] [Applause]
[1:20:36] but notice notice in revelation of jesus
[1:20:40] christ
[1:20:41] he said now we're saved by the blood of
[1:20:44] god
[1:20:45] the eternal god indwelted mortal be
[1:20:48] body in order to take away sin he became
[1:20:51] the lamb in order to shed his blood
[1:20:53] and enter into the veil with consider
[1:20:56] this
[1:20:58] since it is the blood of god it is the
[1:21:01] perfect blood
[1:21:02] and if the perfect blood is loosing us
[1:21:05] from the power
[1:21:06] and bondage and defilement of sin then
[1:21:09] the loosing is perfect can you say
[1:21:11] the loosing is perfect and complete
[1:21:14] and there is now therefore now
[1:21:18] no condemnation notice in romans 8 33
[1:21:22] who shall a anything to the charge
[1:21:25] of god's elect it's god that justifies
[1:21:29] that kid that declares us righteous who
[1:21:31] is he that condemneth
[1:21:32] it is christ that die there it is
[1:21:36] his death gave us the blood the blood
[1:21:39] has loosed us
[1:21:40] there is now no condemnation how can
[1:21:43] there be
[1:21:44] [Applause]
[1:21:46] if you can get in your mind how powerful
[1:21:49] the blood is how can there be there is
[1:21:52] nothing to be condemned for
[1:21:54] because the blood has loosed us from sin
[1:21:56] we are free
[1:21:57] guiltless don't listen to man listen to
[1:22:00] the word
[1:22:01] you are loosed by the blood
[1:22:06] in another place he said he said but
[1:22:08] once you come into the kingdom of god
[1:22:10] through the blood of the lord jesus
[1:22:12] meeting upon the shed blood
[1:22:13] brought through the testimony the public
[1:22:15] testimony of the crimson blood of the
[1:22:17] lord
[1:22:18] you are in here in fellowship where god
[1:22:21] can bless you can you identify
[1:22:25] and you can shout and praise the lord
[1:22:27] and the powers of god working why it's
[1:22:30] god himself
[1:22:31] his own body the mystical body of the
[1:22:34] lord jesus christ here on earth
[1:22:36] operating
[1:22:39] the body in operation operating
[1:22:44] operating upon the basis
[1:22:47] of the shed blood brother brandon said
[1:22:50] that god
[1:22:51] hates a powerless religion and when you
[1:22:54] do not have the blood
[1:22:56] you have a powerless religion there
[1:23:00] is a blood on the mercy seat that is
[1:23:03] still
[1:23:03] interceding day and night for the
[1:23:05] believers
[1:23:07] and when satan comes against you to
[1:23:10] accuse you
[1:23:11] you can say the blood is against you
[1:23:14] [Applause]
[1:23:17] you got a right to it
[1:23:21] now notice when jude over in the book of
[1:23:24] jude that
[1:23:25] jude gives a declaration in verse 3 he
[1:23:28] said
[1:23:29] and i exhort you that you should
[1:23:31] earnestly contend
[1:23:32] for the faith that was once delivered
[1:23:35] unto the saints
[1:23:36] but some people want to limit that faith
[1:23:38] to a creed someone
[1:23:39] limited to a denomination but i say upon
[1:23:42] the authority of god's word
[1:23:43] there is no limit to the faith of god
[1:23:46] that he left for his church
[1:23:48] because he said all things are possible
[1:23:51] to them
[1:23:52] that believe now say this
[1:23:55] it's not limited
[1:23:58] it's not limited why because
[1:24:02] you have a receipt it's a privilege
[1:24:05] of an heir of christ to en to have
[1:24:08] anything
[1:24:08] that is rightfully yours you inherited
[1:24:11] it
[1:24:12] and when satan comes and tells you that
[1:24:15] i'm going to do
[1:24:16] this you say no you're not
[1:24:20] it's not limited and satan has no
[1:24:23] power over a believer
[1:24:30] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:24:35] you remember you you remember yo as soon
[1:24:38] as i began to tell
[1:24:39] tell this little testimony you you'll
[1:24:42] catch it in the message
[1:24:43] and brother burnham said there was a man
[1:24:44] that had sponsored his meeting one time
[1:24:46] that
[1:24:47] had got out under some construction
[1:24:49] under a roofer or a sidewall there
[1:24:51] and that and it had crushed him and it
[1:24:53] was tons that it fell upon this man
[1:24:56] and he said he said it was just a trick
[1:24:58] of the devil that fell upon
[1:25:00] that that had that had crushed this man
[1:25:02] and he bursted his liver
[1:25:04] and his spleen was put out of place and
[1:25:07] he began brother random began to tell
[1:25:09] his wife he said you know he said you
[1:25:10] know
[1:25:10] he said that was a trick of the devil he
[1:25:12] said here he was sponsoring me in my
[1:25:14] ministry he said but he said i believe
[1:25:16] that when he would sponsor me
[1:25:18] he was sponsoring christ and he said
[1:25:20] that was a trick of the devil that
[1:25:21] that did that he said now honey he said
[1:25:23] he said if jesus was here
[1:25:25] he said jesus wasn't like myself he said
[1:25:28] i'm a sinner
[1:25:29] he said i was born a sinner my mama's a
[1:25:31] sinner my daddy's a sinner
[1:25:32] but jesus's hands were holy hands he
[1:25:36] said
[1:25:36] he said now jesus had holy hands and he
[1:25:38] said if he was here
[1:25:39] he would come and lay his hands upon
[1:25:41] that boy no matter what the conditions
[1:25:43] were
[1:25:44] his liver bursted his spleen out of
[1:25:46] place he would lay his holy hands upon
[1:25:48] him
[1:25:48] and and everything would come back in
[1:25:51] the order
[1:25:52] because jesus was who he was he said but
[1:25:55] you see he said the difference is
[1:25:57] he said my hands are dirty hands he said
[1:26:00] but
[1:26:00] he said if the lord would give me a
[1:26:02] vision he said i could go down there in
[1:26:05] the authority of that vision
[1:26:06] and i could lay my hands upon him and
[1:26:09] he'd get well
[1:26:10] he said but i begin to think about
[1:26:12] something
[1:26:13] he said i began to think about something
[1:26:15] he said he said now whether
[1:26:17] whether i got the vision or whether i
[1:26:19] didn't get the vision
[1:26:20] it was my same hands that was being laid
[1:26:23] on that man
[1:26:24] with the same faith whether i got a
[1:26:26] vision or whether i don't got a vision
[1:26:29] god was using my same hands
[1:26:32] so do you realize tonight that god is
[1:26:35] looking
[1:26:35] for your hands he said and they shall
[1:26:38] lay
[1:26:39] hands on the sick and they shall recover
[1:26:42] you ain't got to have a vision because
[1:26:44] there's a blood
[1:26:46] that is representing the god of heaven
[1:26:48] and when you go in his name
[1:26:51] you are going in the authority of the
[1:26:54] name of jesus christ
[1:26:56] whether it's your dirty hands whether
[1:26:58] it's your life or not
[1:26:59] you're representing the almighty god
[1:27:04] hallelujah
[1:27:07] that watch was built to be on your hand
[1:27:10] but if ain't operating right
[1:27:12] you need to take it to a technician that
[1:27:14] can put it back
[1:27:15] in his rightful operation brother
[1:27:18] branham would type
[1:27:19] the new birth to that watch and the
[1:27:22] mainspring of that watch
[1:27:24] he said now he said he said when you go
[1:27:26] to look over in ezekiel chapter 36 and
[1:27:27] 25
[1:27:28] he said you go in there and you watch he
[1:27:31] said he said now he said i will give you
[1:27:33] a new heart and a new spirit and then i
[1:27:37] will put my spirit upon you
[1:27:39] notice there's a lot of people that stop
[1:27:41] when they get that new spirit
[1:27:43] and they say well i stopped drinking i i
[1:27:45] stopped cussing
[1:27:46] i stopped doing this but they never went
[1:27:48] on far enough
[1:27:50] you see because if you don't go no
[1:27:52] further than that
[1:27:53] you'll find yourself back out on the
[1:27:55] street again you because you can't
[1:27:57] control your emotions you can't control
[1:28:00] your faith
[1:28:00] you can't control your senses with a new
[1:28:03] spirit
[1:28:05] are you with me you can't control
[1:28:07] yourself you see if you only got a new
[1:28:09] spirit
[1:28:10] if you've only went through
[1:28:11] justification and sanctification
[1:28:14] you will walk back out go out and fall
[1:28:16] into the same sin
[1:28:18] that you just came out of because you
[1:28:20] didn't go
[1:28:21] far enough billy just get in far enough
[1:28:25] and you won't fall out so you realize
[1:28:28] that if you can go far enough everything
[1:28:31] will go to work and exactly
[1:28:33] he said the holy spirit's like the
[1:28:35] mainspring of that famous watch
[1:28:37] and when the holy spirit is sitting
[1:28:39] there upon all those other cogs
[1:28:41] everything goes to circling
[1:28:43] and working the way that it was built to
[1:28:45] do
[1:28:47] you were built to worship him you were
[1:28:49] built to praise him
[1:28:51] you were built to pray you were built to
[1:28:54] get on your knees
[1:28:55] you were built to call almighty god
[1:29:02] but if something's not in place
[1:29:05] everything ain't operating the way it
[1:29:06] was built to operate
[1:29:08] but just go back down
[1:29:12] to the well and get another drink
[1:29:18] just get one more drink of it
[1:29:21] he said the enemy come to steal to kill
[1:29:24] and to rob you he said but i come to
[1:29:27] give you life
[1:29:27] and that should have it more abundantly
[1:29:30] he said i didn't he hadn't just given
[1:29:31] you the holy ghost
[1:29:32] so that you can live right for one
[1:29:34] service he's given you the holy ghost
[1:29:36] so that everything is in control and
[1:29:39] he's controlling you
[1:29:40] and you're not controlling him
[1:29:44] you see if you don't have that
[1:29:45] mainspring sitting there everything gets
[1:29:47] off time
[1:29:48] everything's off time you won't show up
[1:29:50] to worship at the right time
[1:29:52] you'll show up at 7 15 7 20
[1:29:55] when the when the song leaders done got
[1:29:57] off when they said well i'll just go on
[1:29:59] i'll let the song leader go past this
[1:30:01] first 15 or 20 minutes
[1:30:02] and i'll just come in there and i'll sit
[1:30:05] down because the
[1:30:06] word is the important part i can miss
[1:30:09] the singing
[1:30:09] and still get it
[1:30:11] [Applause]
[1:30:13] what an idea the reason why you come in
[1:30:17] 20 minutes late it's because you don't
[1:30:20] have a mainspring
[1:30:21] that's working everything because if you
[1:30:23] had the mainspring
[1:30:25] you'd want that atmosphere in the first
[1:30:27] 15 minutes
[1:30:33] you see if you don't have that
[1:30:34] mainspring that's controlling
[1:30:37] you'll get off time you'll get lacks a
[1:30:39] days ago and say well god was doing that
[1:30:41] for days gone by
[1:30:42] or maybe god's doing that in the future
[1:30:44] but if you got the mainspring sitting
[1:30:45] there
[1:30:45] he'll say now are we the sons of god
[1:30:49] right now not some day in the future not
[1:30:51] some day going by
[1:30:53] not waiting for adoption we are the
[1:30:56] adopted
[1:30:57] sons of god we are placed
[1:31:00] we are anointed and we have power over
[1:31:04] every sickness over every devil
[1:31:07] over every disease over every
[1:31:10] circumstance
[1:31:12] he said wait a minute brother andrew
[1:31:13] you're getting a little you're having a
[1:31:15] little bit of audacity
[1:31:16] about that i know in whom i have
[1:31:18] believed
[1:31:19] and i know where i'm standing at it's
[1:31:22] not who i
[1:31:22] am but it's who i'm representing
[1:31:26] and if the body isn't moving in full
[1:31:29] operation
[1:31:31] you will never see your position over
[1:31:34] top of the enemy
[1:31:35] you see if you don't realize that you
[1:31:37] have been adopted and placed as a son of
[1:31:39] god
[1:31:40] the enemy will always hold that over
[1:31:42] your head and say that's for
[1:31:44] one day coming that is not for a day
[1:31:46] coming
[1:31:47] it's for you
[1:31:49] [Applause]
[1:31:52] well i listen to the message i play the
[1:31:54] tapes i come to church
[1:31:55] i do my part but i feel like i just
[1:31:59] haven't met jesus yet
[1:32:02] you see you can have the tapes you can
[1:32:05] have the pictures
[1:32:06] you can have all the quotes but if you
[1:32:08] don't have him
[1:32:09] the life giver the life sustainer you're
[1:32:12] all in all
[1:32:12] the alpha and omega you don't have
[1:32:15] anything
[1:32:16] [Applause]
[1:32:20] they said well they said what is it like
[1:32:22] brother andrew to meet jesus
[1:32:25] what's it like what's it like what was
[1:32:28] it like to meet him
[1:32:29] face to face some people have gone so
[1:32:32] far
[1:32:33] in the message and never met the god of
[1:32:36] the message
[1:32:39] let me tell you you meet jesus one time
[1:32:42] you don't have to try to figure out the
[1:32:44] bible anymore
[1:32:45] you don't have to try to place quotes
[1:32:46] and quotes and quotes on quotes
[1:32:48] on top of quotes he'll make this work
[1:32:52] but if you don't have the mainspring
[1:32:54] you'll never line up the quotes
[1:32:56] you'll have the head over top of the
[1:32:59] feet
[1:32:59] and not over top of the shoulders your
[1:33:02] puzzle will be off
[1:33:05] but meeting jesus is the greatest thing
[1:33:08] you'll ever do
[1:33:10] meeting jesus will make you love
[1:33:12] everybody
[1:33:14] meeting jesus will make you love your
[1:33:15] wife like never before
[1:33:17] meeting jesus will make you the best
[1:33:20] worker in your company
[1:33:22] meeting jesus will make you the best
[1:33:24] path player
[1:33:25] meeting jesus will make you the best
[1:33:27] worshiper
[1:33:28] meeting jesus will make you the best in
[1:33:30] your life
[1:33:32] [Applause]
[1:33:35] well that was fresh praise the lord
[1:33:37] anyhow
[1:33:40] notice that jesus said in john 14 and 20
[1:33:43] he said
[1:33:43] at that day you shall know that i am in
[1:33:46] my father
[1:33:47] and you and me and i in you now notice
[1:33:50] verse 26 he said
[1:33:52] but the comforter which is the holy
[1:33:54] ghost
[1:33:55] whom the father will send in my name
[1:33:59] he shall teach you all things and bring
[1:34:01] all things to your remembrance
[1:34:04] whatsoever i have said unto you
[1:34:08] he will do this he'll come in my name
[1:34:12] he'll teach him my name he'll preach in
[1:34:15] my name
[1:34:16] and when you find somebody that is not
[1:34:18] preaching in the name of jesus
[1:34:20] and you find somebody that's not moving
[1:34:22] in the name of jesus
[1:34:24] they'll find somebody that's off the
[1:34:25] word somewhere but notice
[1:34:27] what he what he says in ezekiel he said
[1:34:29] that i will
[1:34:30] sanctify my name
[1:34:34] among the heathen that they might know
[1:34:36] that i
[1:34:37] am a holy god notice when when moses
[1:34:41] goes out there on the backside of the
[1:34:42] desert he goes out there and
[1:34:45] he's been out there for 40 years and he
[1:34:47] starts having a conversation with the
[1:34:48] bush
[1:34:49] and you think we're weird
[1:34:53] he starts talking to a bush and the bush
[1:34:56] starts talking back to him
[1:34:58] but this ain't some uh ordinary bush
[1:35:00] this bush is on fire
[1:35:01] but the bush is not consumed and the
[1:35:04] bush starts telling him to take his
[1:35:05] shoes off
[1:35:06] but where he's on holy ground and he
[1:35:08] begins to talk to him about his people
[1:35:10] you see what god was doing he was
[1:35:12] telling him where he came from
[1:35:14] and where he was going he began to tell
[1:35:16] him that i
[1:35:17] am thy god i seen you i was the god of
[1:35:20] abraham
[1:35:21] i was the god of isaac and i will be
[1:35:23] your god and he said well whom will i
[1:35:25] say that has sent me
[1:35:26] you tell them i am that i am and he
[1:35:29] starts telling him
[1:35:30] about what's in front of him he said how
[1:35:33] am i going to do these things
[1:35:34] and he starts asking him a question what
[1:35:36] do you got in your hand
[1:35:37] and he said what i got in my hand he
[1:35:38] said i got a rod and it throws rod down
[1:35:40] it becomes a snake
[1:35:41] he says pick it up again and it becomes
[1:35:43] a staff again you see that rod in
[1:35:45] moses's hand
[1:35:46] was different from any other rod that
[1:35:48] was in somebody else's hand
[1:35:50] somebody else had a shepherd's rod in
[1:35:51] their hand but moses had a judgment rod
[1:35:54] in his hand
[1:35:54] you see it wasn't moses's thick it was
[1:35:56] god's stick and when god moved on that
[1:35:58] stick
[1:35:59] supernatural things take place it
[1:36:01] touched a rock and there came water from
[1:36:03] a rock
[1:36:03] it touched water and water turned into
[1:36:06] blood you see when he would stretch
[1:36:07] forth that rod
[1:36:09] you see what it was doing he was showing
[1:36:11] the power
[1:36:12] of almighty god that god was over top of
[1:36:15] egypt and that god was controlling a man
[1:36:18] so much in the operation of the body of
[1:36:21] moses
[1:36:22] that he was identifying himself in human
[1:36:25] flesh again
[1:36:29] you see if those egyptians could ever
[1:36:32] got that rod
[1:36:33] out of moses's hand brother burnham said
[1:36:36] that they'd have got
[1:36:37] moses is whipped ain't a whip moses
[1:36:39] right there
[1:36:40] if they could only got that rod out of
[1:36:42] his hand
[1:36:44] could you imagine studying moses how we
[1:36:47] slept with that rod
[1:36:48] how he did so that they could get it out
[1:36:50] of his hand you know the
[1:36:52] enemy's studying you you think i'm off
[1:36:54] base by saying the enemy studying moses
[1:36:57] but the enemy is studying you trying to
[1:36:59] figure out how to get the name of jesus
[1:37:01] christ
[1:37:02] out of your grips he's trying to take
[1:37:05] the name of jesus christ
[1:37:07] off of your lips out of your praise out
[1:37:09] of your worship
[1:37:11] because he realizes that if he can ever
[1:37:13] get the name of jesus christ
[1:37:15] off of your lips he's got you whip right
[1:37:17] there
[1:37:18] but as long as that name is there satan
[1:37:20] can't move
[1:37:21] no further than the name of jesus christ
[1:37:24] will allow him
[1:37:26] he's trying to make you sick but the
[1:37:28] name of jesus christ
[1:37:30] keeps satan back
[1:37:35] you see moses was guarding that stick
[1:37:40] you think that's weird he was guarding
[1:37:43] that stick
[1:37:44] because it was more than just an
[1:37:46] ordinary stick
[1:37:49] let's just say this is a stain it's a
[1:37:51] moving stick
[1:37:54] he's guarding it with his life
[1:38:00] he's guarding it with his life he's
[1:38:01] going to sleep with it when moses goes
[1:38:04] when he goes just to have dinner with
[1:38:06] his family they said what's wrong with
[1:38:08] moses
[1:38:10] he ain't out there heard no sheep no
[1:38:12] more ain't i carry everything no more
[1:38:15] what's he carrying that thing for he was
[1:38:17] guarding that stick
[1:38:18] with his life because it represented
[1:38:21] something
[1:38:22] it represented something and you see too
[1:38:25] many times today
[1:38:27] men have not guarded the name of jesus
[1:38:29] christ
[1:38:30] or regarded the name of jesus christ in
[1:38:33] the power
[1:38:34] and the sincerity in which they do so
[1:38:38] men take the name of jesus christ in
[1:38:40] vain
[1:38:42] men joke about the name of jesus men
[1:38:44] mock the name of jesus
[1:38:46] they no longer regard the name of jesus
[1:38:50] christ anymore
[1:38:52] but we are to be married in that name
[1:38:55] buried in that name baptize in that name
[1:38:58] he would say over in colossians that
[1:39:00] whatever you do in word
[1:39:02] or deed do it all in the name of jesus
[1:39:05] christ
[1:39:06] it is a sacred name it is a holy name
[1:39:09] it is a pure name and god says i will
[1:39:12] sanctify
[1:39:13] my great name and when i sanctify my
[1:39:16] great name
[1:39:17] i will restore it people brother branham
[1:39:21] would say that the name of jesus christ
[1:39:23] and the godhead deity he's this cap toe
[1:39:26] the capstone revelation of the message
[1:39:29] because it's the greatest revelation
[1:39:32] that there is
[1:39:33] and when you go to guarding what is the
[1:39:35] most precious jewel
[1:39:39] you'll watch your life totally change
[1:39:43] you're not just packing somebody's name
[1:39:46] when you speak the name of jesus you are
[1:39:49] referring
[1:39:50] to the person of christ to the almighty
[1:39:53] god
[1:39:54] but too many times jesus becomes just a
[1:39:58] catchphrase
[1:40:00] jesus becomes just something that you
[1:40:02] put on your coffee go
[1:40:04] jesus comes something that you just hang
[1:40:06] anywhere
[1:40:08] you know something i absolutely i
[1:40:10] absolutely despise
[1:40:12] is that people go and put tracks
[1:40:15] and put their literature in a
[1:40:18] in a in a rest area on a urinal
[1:40:22] and that's got the name of jesus on it
[1:40:24] and they're placing
[1:40:25] the most holy name in the most
[1:40:28] disgusting place
[1:40:29] that there is what a way to witness
[1:40:33] at a toilet it's what people have been
[1:40:37] taught
[1:40:38] that that's okay now i know you think
[1:40:40] it's funny
[1:40:41] but realize the sacredness of the name
[1:40:43] of jesus
[1:40:45] that if you would really carry the power
[1:40:47] of that name
[1:40:48] and you would walk in dignity that you
[1:40:51] are identified in that name
[1:40:53] that you are married to the person of
[1:40:56] that name
[1:40:57] you handle yourself differently you pray
[1:41:02] differently
[1:41:04] yeah when you go to prayer and you begin
[1:41:07] to break into an atmosphere
[1:41:08] and you start calling on that name you
[1:41:11] start speaking that name over situations
[1:41:14] the name of jesus it makes
[1:41:18] satan leave the name of jesus christ
[1:41:22] will tell you that satan is defeated in
[1:41:25] the name of jesus christ
[1:41:27] there is healing in that name there is
[1:41:30] salvation
[1:41:31] in that name there is forgiveness in
[1:41:33] that name
[1:41:34] there is deliverance in that name
[1:41:36] strongholds are broke
[1:41:38] by that name paralytics walk by that
[1:41:41] name
[1:41:41] mountains move and are plucked and cast
[1:41:44] into the sea
[1:41:45] by that name prison doors fling wide by
[1:41:48] that name
[1:41:49] dead babies come to life by that name
[1:41:52] that name has given you power to bind
[1:41:55] the mamba
[1:41:56] that's tried to bite your brother and
[1:41:58] bite your sister
[1:41:59] that name of jesus christ tells hell to
[1:42:02] open up and give way
[1:42:04] in the name of jesus christ the name of
[1:42:07] jesus christ
[1:42:08] is the most holy name that there is
[1:42:13] ain't no other name under heaven or
[1:42:16] earth
[1:42:17] where men should be saved but by the
[1:42:20] name of jesus
[1:42:21] and there is coming a time where every
[1:42:24] knee shall bow
[1:42:25] and every toe shall confess that jesus
[1:42:29] christ is lord
[1:42:32] what is in the hand
[1:42:42] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[1:42:46] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:42:50] david said i will extol his name i will
[1:42:53] exalt his name
[1:42:54] i will glorify thy name isaiah said i
[1:42:57] will exalt his name
[1:42:58] i will glorify his name in the fires
[1:43:04] in my trials i will glorify his name
[1:43:11] i notice i'm gonna read you one more
[1:43:13] quote and we'll
[1:43:14] invite the musicians come but notice
[1:43:17] you've heard this before
[1:43:19] you've heard it but i want you to catch
[1:43:21] what brother branham says here he said
[1:43:22] now listen if the first time that the
[1:43:24] name of jesus was ever spoke through
[1:43:26] human lips
[1:43:27] made a dead baby come to life and jump
[1:43:29] for joy in a mother's womb
[1:43:31] what ought to do for the church that's
[1:43:33] claimed
[1:43:34] to be born again of the spirit
[1:43:39] what it ought to do for churches born
[1:43:42] again in the spirit
[1:43:43] i notice this
[1:43:46] how can a killer cancer stay there
[1:43:54] how can a killer cancer stay there
[1:43:57] how can a killer cataract how can a deaf
[1:44:00] or dumb spirit bind you
[1:44:02] when in my name they shall cast out
[1:44:04] devils hallelujah
[1:44:06] just don't doubt take his word like mary
[1:44:08] did and start rejoicing
[1:44:09] notice he begins to speak to the people
[1:44:11] in the prayer he said will you do that
[1:44:13] you that's going to be prayed for
[1:44:14] tonight will you as soon as the name of
[1:44:17] jesus
[1:44:17] is called on you will you begin to leap
[1:44:19] for joy
[1:44:20] saying praise god it's all over now
[1:44:23] hallelujah
[1:44:24] it's all gone now that
[1:44:27] i was speaking over to our pastor this
[1:44:29] week and we were listening to tape after
[1:44:31] tape after tape after tape
[1:44:32] going down going down the road and we
[1:44:34] were listening and brother branham would
[1:44:36] say
[1:44:36] just go on your own believing in the
[1:44:38] name of jesus christ just go on your
[1:44:40] road believer
[1:44:41] in the name of jesus christ but people
[1:44:43] want something
[1:44:45] so definitive that it's called out their
[1:44:48] name
[1:44:48] but it's that simple it's that simple
[1:44:52] he don't have to call your name you
[1:44:53] already know your name he don't have to
[1:44:55] call your address
[1:44:56] you know where you live at he don't have
[1:44:57] to call your situations
[1:44:59] you know what you're dealing with he
[1:45:00] don't have to call who you've been
[1:45:02] married to and who you've been living
[1:45:03] with you know your sin
[1:45:05] it's that simple tonight that if the
[1:45:07] name of jesus christ
[1:45:09] is spoke over you you can walk away
[1:45:12] completely whole
[1:45:13] because it's not your situation
[1:45:16] it's the name
[1:45:18] [Applause]
[1:45:21] [Music]
[1:45:23] strongholds are now being loosed
[1:45:27] what is it now i believe it
[1:45:30] now i receive it
[1:45:34] it's god moving across the people
[1:45:39] speaking in that name living in that
[1:45:41] name
[1:45:43] how can a killer cancer stay in your
[1:45:45] presence
[1:45:47] when you are an ambassador of heaven
[1:45:53] if we are the body moving under our
[1:45:56] headship
[1:45:58] then we must say what the head says
[1:46:02] we must believe what the head has said
[1:46:06] we must move where the head says move
[1:46:10] if he tells you to pray for this brother
[1:46:12] don't just wait for another moment
[1:46:14] get up right there and pray for that
[1:46:15] brother when you go to lifting up the
[1:46:18] name of jesus christ
[1:46:20] i want you to know that it'll bring
[1:46:21] every power down the name of jesus
[1:46:24] christ
[1:46:24] broke down a table one time brought down
[1:46:26] clothes and brought down a guitar
[1:46:28] what will it do over cancer
[1:46:31] that is nothing but a bluff what will it
[1:46:34] do over your situation
[1:46:36] when you speak that name
[1:46:45] as the musicians come
[1:46:54] i was a great missionary you all heard
[1:46:57] uh
[1:46:58] her name was david livingstone it was a
[1:47:01] great missionary over in africa
[1:47:04] and david livingstone was a was a doctor
[1:47:07] and he was going through the jungles and
[1:47:08] he was
[1:47:09] and he was he was going down through
[1:47:10] there and he came in contact with
[1:47:12] with the chief chief of the tribe and
[1:47:15] the chief he began to have a
[1:47:16] conversation with the chief and he began
[1:47:17] to speak with the chief and he began to
[1:47:18] talk to him back and forth
[1:47:20] and they made a blood covenant with one
[1:47:22] another and david livingstone and the
[1:47:24] chief they plucked their veins and they
[1:47:26] and they began to make a blood covenant
[1:47:27] david livingstone drunk half of it and
[1:47:29] the chief took the other half of it
[1:47:31] and it made a blood covenant between the
[1:47:33] two and because of this covenant they
[1:47:35] said what will you require of me
[1:47:37] and they and the chief said i'd like to
[1:47:39] have your i'd like to have your white
[1:47:41] coat that you wear
[1:47:42] he said now he said what would you
[1:47:44] require of me he said i'd like to have
[1:47:46] the spear
[1:47:47] that you carry the chief would carry
[1:47:49] because david recognized
[1:47:51] that he was going further on in his
[1:47:53] journey and david realized that the
[1:47:55] further he would get that he would run
[1:47:57] into different traps
[1:47:58] and when when those tribes would run out
[1:48:01] and go to kill him because he was the
[1:48:02] only white man
[1:48:03] those people didn't even know they were
[1:48:05] black until he got in their presence
[1:48:07] and they recognized so they would go out
[1:48:09] and try to kill him
[1:48:11] but when they recognized that spear they
[1:48:14] recognized that that was a chief spear
[1:48:16] and there had to be a blood covenant
[1:48:18] that had already been taken place
[1:48:20] and if you could realize that the
[1:48:22] enemies that are chasing you down and
[1:48:24] trying to kill you
[1:48:25] that you've got in your hand the spear
[1:48:27] of the chief of the king of kings
[1:48:30] his name is the name of names he is the
[1:48:33] lord of lords
[1:48:34] he is the king of kings he is the great
[1:48:37] and mighty god
[1:48:38] and when you go in that name you are
[1:48:41] packing
[1:48:42] a blood covenant and you are a covenant
[1:48:45] brother
[1:48:45] there is no power there is no power that
[1:48:48] can stand against that name
[1:48:54] what will these hands touch
[1:48:57] what will this mouth speak what prayers
[1:49:00] will be prayed
[1:49:03] what will your hands touch whose life
[1:49:06] will you touch
[1:49:09] god's wanting to operate through a body
[1:49:14] that's living and prophesying
[1:49:18] and speaking his name that the heathen
[1:49:21] might know
[1:49:23] that i am the holy god
[1:49:29] he didn't just start you to see where
[1:49:32] you would just go throughout your
[1:49:33] journey
