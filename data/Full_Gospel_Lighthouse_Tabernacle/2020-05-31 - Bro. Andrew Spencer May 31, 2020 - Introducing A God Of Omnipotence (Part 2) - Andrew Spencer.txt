here's some time ago over in africa i was talking to him to an old saint he said brother brandon i know you believe in the supernatural and i said certainly my brother he said years ago i used to think i was somebody so i thought i was really a christian and he said then up in our church i had to climb a hill where i stopped my little car and said i had to climb a hill about all three or four hundred yards to get around the bushes and things getting up and said we'd have prayer meeting up there and said i thought i was really a christian he said i know all the bible i studied all the hebrew i studied all the right pronunciations of the words and said anybody walk up to me i could talk to him like that about the bible i know what i was talking about he said one night i was going up to church there'd been a lot of conflict in our church said this little party's against one another you know i raised i said yes sir he said oh my road up the hill i was walking and all at once i

good thing you just wait a little while it says as i walked up the hill come up a man came up the hill and said he had a bundle on his back they were way bigger than the man and said he was just a painting and a blowing hand making his little short steps trying to get up and i said fella can i help you pack this load up hill he said no i got a packet but i looked at his hand so i knew that it was a vision he had scars in his hand so i fell down and i said lord are you packing the sins of the world in that cycle so no i'm just packing yours just getting you up the hill just so you can get

here it's a testimony of what we'll be doing over there amen it's so good to be in the house of the lord this morning so good to see brother kenny snyder in the presence of the lord this morning god bless you this morning and each every one of you we just welcome you here in the name of the lord jesus christ amen trust you were all able to stream last night's service and be a part of that service i know that you weren't here physically but i certainly certainly have felt the prayers of the saints during this time and and so we so appreciate you for being a part of this service and every service and so we greet you today in the name of the lord also brother ron sends his greetings to you i don't have a i don't have a surprise up my sleeve this this morning brother ron's not in the back you've got me this morning so i hope that's okay with you amen amen maybe we sing that song i'll introduce you to this friend of mine amen before we go to the word this morning i'll introduce you to this friend of mine his name is jesus he's with me all the time you'll learn to love him serving like i do if you're awake just a moment i'm gonna introduce them to you i'll introduce you to this friend of mine his name is jesus he's with me all the time you'll learn to love him serve him like i do [Music] i'll introduce you to this friend of mine his name is jesus you'll learn to love him [Music] [Music] it's the greatest honor of my life to be able to introduce you to this friend of mine jesus amen if you have your bibles this morning we'll turn over in the book of second kings chapter 2 and verse 6. amen second kings chapter two and verse six as we said last evening if you were streaming and if you weren't able to stream i'll do my best to do my best to present it to you and and uh but if you were listening last night you understand where we're going this morning on introducing the god of omnipotence and as i said i had been waiting waiting on the lord for just a the leadership of the lord and and he finally allowed us to be able to speak these things and i have to say i've been i've been quite moved by these things and moved by these studies and i don't feel adequate enough to be able to i don't have the vocabulary to be able to describe how how god how great he truly is but i believe that if god could take a hold of a little bitty redneck this morning and use me that he might be able to declare himself and because when he comes and he starts speaking to us from his word it's so much greater than man's word and so we we just want the spirit of the lord to speak to us this morning and we don't want to get caught up on the flesh realm where we just see one another here but let's see jesus this morning i think that if you if you have not and maybe you already have and i know that you were here that you that were here last weekend you heard brother ron's sermon on who is jesus and to me it's one of brother ron's climax messages and uh it's a very pertinent message so i encourage you if you listen to it go and listen to it again it'll do your heart great good this morning second kings chapter two and verse six the bible says in elijah elijah said unto him terry terry i pray thee here for the lord hath sent me to jordan and he said as the lord liveth and as thy soul liveth i will not leave thee and they too went on and fifty men of the sons of the prophets went and stood to view afar off and and they two stood by jordan and elijah took his mantle and wrapped it together and smote the waters and they were divided hither and thither so that they too went over on dry ground now we've we're very familiar with this scripture we're very familiar with this story i'd say even young children today could probably rehearse this to us but i want you to to capture how great a event this is this is not just this is not just an ordinary man that's walking down to the banks of a river to go fishing but this man is walking down with his servant elisha and he's walking down now there there you have to understand the scene that is taking place that the schools of the prophets are standing behind them and are watching what's getting ready to take place and you understand that that elisha knew that the lord was going to take away elijah on that day and yet he still journeyed on but i want you to capture this morning how great and significant an event this is that there had been others there had been there had been moses that and the children of israel that walked over on dry ground there had been joshua and the children of israel that walked on on dry ground and so many times we rehearse those things and we are familiar with those things but we allow those things to become so uh we we allow them to be so custom to us that we're that we're so accustomed to the supernatural that it's just that it's just everyday life for some people but don't get don't get so encapsulated that this is the way things are but this is a supernatural god and only he can produce those things and elijah took his mantle and wrapped it together and smote the waters and they were divided hither and thither so that they too went over on dry ground and it came to pass when they were gone over that elijah said unto elisha ask what i shall do for thee before i be taken away from thee and elijah elisha said i pray thee let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me and he said thou has asked a hard thing nevertheless if very big word if thou see me when i am taken away from thee it shall be so unto thee but if not it shall not be so how many here has a need this morning like to take before the lord amen god sees your hand this morning heavenly father we come before your throne of mercy lord this morning expressing our our love and our gratitude for the opportunity to be in the house of the lord to be able to stand in your august presence here this morning and to stand here and know that the living god is amongst us and that your children have gathered to to to eat upon the revealed word of the our father we pray that you would speak from heaven lord as we've already expressed we're not capable in our own humanity to be able to bring forth in the the dialogue and the vocabulary to be able to present to the people how great you truly are but this i know father that if i can get myself out of the way and that you can use these mortal lips and this mortal clay to speak through father that your name will be high and lifted up father lord i believe that it is the whole duty of man to be able to to lift up the name of jesus and to praise a true and living god lord i pray today that you would come and you would receive our worship i pray that you would look out upon those uplifted hands this morning and that you would reach out and touch them whatever that need is o god we know that you're more than enough to take care of that situation so we pray today that you would go forth and let us see your majesty declared lord jesus our hearts are open our minds are ready to receive oh god and i pray that your people as they would begin to pull on that word may you begin to speak to them from heaven father we love you today and we glorify the god of heaven in the name of jesus christ amen you may be seated this morning in the presence of the lord so said we'd like to speak to you on introducing the god of omnipotence and we know we know what omnipotence means it means it means to be the all-powerful and none of us sitting here this morning we have a portion of that but we are not all-powerful we are not unlimited we are limited in our faculties we have the abilities to be able to use our resources and be able to speak and be able to function but at the end of the day you get weary and you get tired you get wore out and there's some things that just get too much for your mind sometimes but there is a god that is ever present here this morning that is that is not weary and he's not wore out he's not in crisis mode he's not shook up he's not tore up and i want you to know that christ is not diminishing and whatsoever he's not fleeting he's not failing and he is the infinite god that knows all things that he is proving himself that he's the same yesterday today and forever and that all of his attributes are available to us as believers of this message that there are things that have been dispersed in this hour that that the carnal mind cannot grasp in its own senses but it takes a spiritual revelation to be able to grab a hold of the things that have been released in this hour and we know that that when when the church disbelieves satan and she believes the spirit's revelation of the word that the gates of hell shall not prevail against her so we realize this morning that we cannot be standing upon our own thoughts or on our own merits or what we've learned or our own knowledge of what the message is and on what we think things are this is the way things are but we've got to be standing on the revelation of the word for we know that we are up against the foe that we're up against an enemy that has been on the job for over 6 000 years and as we know in time that he's been on the battle he's been on the job he's been working he's been studying your dna and he's looking at you he's looking at your family history and he's looking at the cycles that your family has not been able to break so we know that we have an opponent that has been studying us and as satan's eden brother branham would say that that he's going to deliver something to you that will help you keep the punches off of you so we look and we can look at this as we would look at a champion this morning we look at a boxer how that those two opponents are coming up against each other that they are studying one another they're studying how they practice they're studying their habits and they're looking for a certain weakness and here we are in this great contest of time between god and satan and the power of the living god and the power of satan this hour as we're watching as a church of the living god is standing here that we're watching that satan himself has has come against the church of the living god and that he is going to he is going to try to strike you he's going to try to torment you he's going to try to destroy you he's going to try to tear you down he's going to try to beat you up so he is studying you and it is our duty as the sons and daughters of god to be able to study his tactic and watch what he's going to do how he's going to try to come with an uppercut and how he's going to stand his feet and how he's going to approach in the battle and how he gets weak and how he is defeated i can already give you the secret to this this morning that it's the word of god that will whip the devil any time any place under any circumstance under any situation over any sickness and we have the word of god this morning to be able to cover up satan this morning i wish i had somebody to preach to this morning that that we have the very literal life of god this morning to be able to cover up satan with this morning to be able to push him down cover him up and know that there is a living god that is here that is present and more than able to do what you cannot even comprehend in your own mind this morning now we know that god has always he's always required a believer in every day he's looking for that one man and how many would say that i'll be that one man this morning i'll be that one lady or one sister here but the bible tells us in romans 3 and 3 that what if some did not believe shall their unbelief make the faith of god without effect god forbid yea let god be true but every man a liar as it is written that thou mayest mightest be justified in thy sayings and mightest overcome when thou art judged you see there are things that happen in every one of our lives we're not exempt to things but there are things that have happened in our lives and the reason there that there are things that come and you watch a person as they are under that circumstance or under that trial that they they seem as if their feet are planted on a sturdy rock and it's if they're unmovable and it's like a christian today is like stonewall jackson back in the civil war he stood there in the opposition with bullets flying around him and i believe that there is a people on earth today that is standing on thus saith the lord that knows where they're standing at they're not afraid to stand they're not afraid to go through the fiery trials they're not afraid to face opposition because you see there are people that will give up in a battle there are people that will back off there are people that will doubt but you can't make a believer doubt no matter what you put on him why because he's a believer you can put sickness on him and he'll still believe you can you can put sickness or doubt on a lady of grace and she's still going to believe because she's a believer she was chosen before the foundation of the world brother doug that she would stand in the hour of torment we realize that we're living in an hour and you look at the nation today they're so tore up and there there's riots that are going on there's fear there there's tactics that are taking place and people are in pandemonium and they're catching up with the things that are going on but i have a word from you that we have a word that is made clear to us the modern events made clear by prophecy that we know that these things are coming and that there is a there is darkness all over egypt but there is light down here in goshen children don't you be so caught up with the things that are going on in the world i want you to know that before one drop one bomb drops on this nation there's going to be a people that will be taken up in a moment in a twinkling of an eye so don't you get your eyes on fear oh hallelujah you see the reason why you're here today is because that you are a believer and that you're standing on this word i believe that's why you're not afraid that's why you're not afraid to go into the valley and to take and walk down through and carry your stones of faith and carry jesus with you is that right is that why you're here this morning is because you're a believer you're a believer of the great i am and he is the omnipotent god and i i i don't as i said i don't have the vocabulary to be able to tell you how great this god is but i can take the scriptures and i can tell you what he has said about himself and this i've learned that if you go to talking about god god shows up so this morning if you don't mind i'd like to talk about him and i talk i like to talk about his host of armies and i'd like to talk about you i know that if i get to bragging on you in the natural realm you get a little you get a little excited because i'm talking about you so this morning i'm going to talk about you but i'm not going to talk about you in your natural realm i'm going to talk about who you are in christ jesus i'm going to talk about how great you are and how satan can't defeat you why because there is a god that is here this morning that is you as christians are packing on the inside of your soul and we realize this morning that that we're conscious of that angelic realm that is here this morning because the bible tells us that the angels of the lord are encamped about them that fear him and we realize this morning that you are those that are believers that fear him and we understand that there are angels that are here this morning that have come to watch you as you worship that the prophet would tell us that those angels are standing at attention this morning we're conscious we're conscious that they're here now you may not see them but you are influenced by that angelic realm this morning that you brother branham said in one spot that you've been bumping into them you've been bumping into them and it changes your attitude it changes your avenues of life but daily we're bumping into angelic people and angelic beings that are there and we realize that though we may not see it but we can feel the brush of angels wings but i want you to know this morning children that god didn't show up in elkton just to watch the angel stand that attention he showed up in elkton this morning to watch you his children to watch you worship he's moved by your need i i've been working on a project behind the scenes and we'll try to make that available as soon as we can but we've been working on some things and and there you'll hear some of these things that i will maybe speak of this morning but early early very early in the spencer's walk in our walk with this message that you you've heard this story before that that there was one morning where people used to walk the streets back in those days they don't walk them like they do with some people walking but you just didn't let people you don't let people in like you do now like you did then you're afraid to open the door for anybody but back then it was more a common thing when people would walk the streets and and my teeny my papa were there in their house and and my dad and my uncle mark were very very young boys at that time but there was a stranger that had walked up the house and walked up and knocked on the door and he and he asked if he could just have something to eat and they were sitting there having biscuits and gravy they were sitting there having biscuits and gravy so they invited this train drone in into the household there and they begin to commune with him and speak to him and my papa charlie would sit and converse with this with this stranger and speak to him he said and he ate his he ate his biscuits and gravy and oh i wish i had some of that this morning but and you know he sat there and he ate some of those things and and as he got up he began to walk towards the door and he turned around and he laid his hand over on our pastor which is a little boy at that time and said you have a blessed life and they told him that he said that stranger said this is a blessed home this is a blessed boy right here and as that stranger stepped out onto that platform of that concrete way he stepped out there and as they were watching that stranger vanished right before their eyes and they walked back and forth and they were looking they were looking for him they walked the streets they walked and seen where he was to see if they could find him and they couldn't find it and they realized what the bible had said to them that that be aware that you are entertaining straight angels unaware so we understand that this morning that we have been a blessed people i want you to know i have been affected by that angel i'd say that this church has been affected by that angel you see it because you see there is an angelic realm that maybe you don't know of this morning or maybe you're not conscious of but i want you to know that you can feel their effects i can feel his effect standing at this platform this morning because i realize that he told me that he would be there with me i told him a long time ago that as long as you were with me i would do your work and children i'm telling you without a shadow of a doubt he stood by this platform time in and time out i've never walked to this platform except for a time or a time where i didn't feel him that i didn't know that he was there because he's a god that is committed to keep his promise and maybe you don't see it this morning but there's an angel that is dispatched to take care of you to watch over you to minister to you oh hallelujah those angels are there they're watching you every one of you you little children you've got an angel that's watching over you hallelujah you got an angel that's watching over you remember that time brother branham got on billy paul for how he struck his son and he told him he said you did that out of anger and when you did you affected you you hurt the angel the lord when you did that out of anger but never to do that and brother branham would teach us that even people of what we would say of mental retardation or or that style or that style of human being that those kind of people have a special angel just like children have a special angel over them so parents you can get all excited about your children that they got to do this or they got to do that there is somebody that's more powerful than you oh hallelujah is anybody in the church of god this morning but there's an angel that is watching over your children and that we realize that those angels are here that those angels are moving that those angels are acting hallelujah in god's seed we look over in the bible and we could see that men of god were affected by an angelic realm how that philip how that he was down there and he was preaching a revival down there in samaria but an angel of the lord came and directed him to go down to gaza and there he found a there he found a man that was studying over on the scriptures in isaiah and he said can you understand these things he said i cannot unless i be taught of these things and there philip began to preach to him and speak to him these things but you notice that you'll notice what had happened it was the angel of the lord that had directed him down there the angel knew where that eunuch would be at but that germ of life had to come through the body that germ of life as the prophet would say in spoken word as the original seed it cannot come from that of jailorgram it's got to come through the body when peter was was sent down there to cornelius's house when he was up on the rooftop and he was there and an angel angel the lord came and directed him down to cornelius's house and cornelius told him don't you be ashamed or don't you be able to be afraid to take of unclean or clean things but you see that angel knew what was going to take place but that germ that germ had to come through the body it's got to come through you and i just like when paul was on his road to damascus and there was a vision that was set before him you know what i'm talking about this morning there was a vision that was set before him and the vision directed him down to ananias's house and ananias the germ of life came through ananias whoo hallelujah hallelujah do you know this this morning that those angels were watching you that those angels knew what would be said those angels knew how you would act how you'd sit on your phone and not listen to me and how you'd fan yourself and how you get so caught up well i'm still tired i ain't got woke up but those angels knew where you'd be sitting at this morning but it takes the germ of life has to come through the body hallelujah hallelujah it was an angel that came and rolled the stone away do you realize how powerful that angelic realm is this morning that he has all power in heaven and earth has given unto him and that he is able our god i want you to know that he's an omnipotent god he's all-powerful and i want you to know that he's able this morning look at your neighbor say he's able you see the ability of god is greater than man the ability of god is greater than satan the bible said in daniel 3 and 17 that he's able to deliver in luke 3 and 8 it says that he's able to raise up children from these stones in romans 4 and 21 it says that he's able to fulfill these promises in second corinthians 9 8 he says that he's able to make grace abound in ephesians 3 and 20 he is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we could ever ask or think hallelujah in second timothy 1 and 12 he's able to guard the soul's treasure hallelujah in hebrews 7 and 25 he's able to save to the uttermost hallelujah in jude 1-24 he's able to keep you from falling hallelujah well maybe i'm just going to preach to the angelic crown this morning because i don't see that i've got any humans to preach to there's nobody here that really wants what i've got this morning this realm is tangible this realm is accessible look at your neighbor and say wake up have you come to have church if i have to i can go back to the ten that enjoyed me preaching i don't mind you'd be safer at home some of you sitting there thinking that i'd be safer if i didn't have to wear this face mask at home if you're that afraid you shouldn't come here i'm not asked you are determined to make you come here this morning and you sit there all afraid you need to shake yourself you need to shake yourself this morning oh my brother branham said now how can a man how could a freezing man get worn by a painting fire how can a starving man eat from painted picture of food if god is not a man who will entice and tantalize with some painted picture what the holy ghost was in what jesus christ was then he is now just the same as he was then the same yesterday today and forever we just need that fire we realize this morning that it's the presence of god we realize that it's got to be the presence of god is essential for the supernatural to take place you and i love talking about the supernatural we love talking about those miracles but those miracles are not possible unless he is there hallelujah this year it has been our theme that god is with us and we will see miracles the reason why we will see miracles is because god is with us it's not because our friend is with us it's not because the government's behind us but because god is behind us and that the presence of god is essential for the supernatural to take place some of you are sitting here and you need back problems straightened out but i want you to know that you have showed up at the right place this morning you didn't come to a doctor's office you came to dr jesus and if you had the ability this morning you know god's got the ability but if you had the ability to reach out in faith this morning and touch the omnipotent god he's strong enough this morning you hold that thing that you need in your life the thing that you desire in your life and i want to tell you as you're holding that thing in your life that this god that i'm introducing to you is all-powerful unlimited ain't getting wore out ain't getting weak ain't getting frustrated when you're doubting he's still committed to his promise hallelujah he's the all-powerful god and it always takes the miraculous to speak of the omnipotence you see omnipotence is the all-powerful and it takes the miraculous to vindicate the omnipotence and only the miraculous can do that i teach another word is a very fine thing now faith comes by hearing and hearing the word but it always takes the miraculous to vindicate that the omnipotent still lives and reigns we must have the miraculous notice what the prophet says to you i believe that the church is now standing on the threshold of the greatest vindication of omnipotence that the world has ever known david said in psalms 72 and 18 blessed be the lord god and the god of israel who only do with wondrous things only he i can't make it work you can't make it work but only he can do these wondrous things we got people that say that she's ella she and that she's eloher but you cannot make any of this word function without him we look here as our scripture we look at the prophet elijah and we look at how how his life was depicted before us and we're very familiar with the life of elijah who had many mighty miracles in his ministry and we look and we see that elijah was termed the prophet of fire and we could see how that he was how would he recall fire down from heaven but look as you look at the summary of his life that three times he was fed by divine supplies that once by ravens secondly by a widow and thirdly by angels and we so we realize that those angels that were here now were there then and that we look at these miracles you can look at them i have eight i think it's eight miracles that had transpired in the ministry of elijah and it was a double portion that was poured on elijah but we look at those miracles that were transpiring in elijah's ministry how that they were performed and you look at the time in which they were being performed at it was a time like today where men were caught up in different religions they were caught up between god worship and baal worship and serving idols and serving man but it come down to a showdown and a showdown is a test between the false and the real and i want you to know that truth always prevails truth always prevails and when it comes down to that showdown on mount carmel that their elijah he got excited and got anointed and he stood there as the worshipers of baal he said let the god that answers by fire let him be god and they stood out there and they made their sacrifice they they did all they could do and and it went all day long and elijah started making fun of them he started saying why don't you scream a little bit louder why don't you jump on your sacrifice well maybe your god's going on vacation but reality of it was is that there was no god of baal that could answer by fire but when it came elijah's turn he said pour the barrels of water on top of it now where did he get that barrel of water from when all of those 12 barrels of water when they were completely out of water in that time it was a time when elijah had the power to shut up the heavens and it did not reign for three years oh but here's to the man of god that knew where a water source was and he said go and fill up the barrels and they poured it on the sacrifice knowing that that water you no good and well you brothers that start a fire that you can't hardly get a fire started when you put a little bit of water on it much less 12 barrels of water but here god had showed up to do the omnipotence and the miraculous that was set up before him and what did god do he showed up to show that he's the only true and living god he didn't die he's still the same yesterday today and forever you see it's in the middle of a contest is when god shows up elijah the prophet of fire you can look over in the scriptures in second kings chapter one and you can see how the king of hosea how that he had fallen through the lattice and how he'd become crippled up and he sent out men to go and search out and inquire at the mouth of elizabeth to see whether he would recover or not and when these captains of 50 came out and they saw a man of the wilderness standing out there elijah was standing out there and he said is there not a god in israel that you would inquire at the mouth of baal that that your king would not recover and the fire of almighty god came down and consumed the captains of 50 and he came and he did this same thing twice you got people in the land so caught up with they don't know what to do is there not a god of the message that's here to answer every single one of these questions hallelujah and elisha had watched the ministry of elijah he'd seen the power of god he'd seen the power of god come down and heard the stories and seen the miracles of the things how that elijah had worked and how that god proved that he was the only true and living god you see the the main thing is that elijah knew he knew that god was omnipotent he knew that he was omnipotent in the junction of time the prophet said but then just before that god brought the show down to show who was god there come a time that there was a prophet coming to the land by the name of elijah who was anointed with the message of god and he performed the miraculous and prove that omnipotence still was miraculous the prophet stood out there and closed the heavens that it didn't reign in the days of his ministry and he brought the reigns down out of the heavens and give earth and angels appeared on the scene hallelujah and baked him some cornbread that kept him 40 days alive while he was out there in the wilderness with god angels appear here in the end time all the prophets and the signposts point and say that this day that angels will appear prophets will arise signs and wonders will arise and if god did that for those little junctions back there what will he do now when all hell is turned loose you look out on the nation today all hell is turned loose if he did those things for those little junctions back there what will he do when all hell is turned loose oh heaven will turn loose angels appearing signs and wonders on the earth counterfeits arising god's proving which is right and wrong you ain't we me and brother alden were just standing in the back and we were talking about the percentage of believers if all were believers in virginia of the of the churches and we know of message churches we wouldn't fill out one percent one percent of virginia oh hallelujah but you are a people that is proving that there is a miraculous god you're not afraid to believe you're not afraid to ask you're not ashamed to ask he said i'm not ashamed to call you brethren and if he said that he's not ashamed of me how could i be ashamed of him [Applause] hallelujah notice this that god said when elijah was under his juniper tree he said no now bring forth the best that we got and cook him a corn cake and set him down some water and this soft-handed angel went over and stroked the little servant of god on the brow he said remember if you've done your best god still got those angels in order he loves you just the same as he loved elijah if you've done your best church he still got angels in order oh hallelujah i wonder if somebody would say i'm giving my best i'm giving my all then god has got angels in order to take care of you i wonder if you did your best during this quarantine time i wonder if those angels were standing in order but now is the time if you weren't in order if you weren't in line if you didn't give your best don't get shook up about it you've got today live you've got today to overcome so let's overcome today and those angels are there they're in order to take care of you you say i don't feel like i'm very much the prophet said he loves you just the same as he loved elijah oh hallelujah hallelujah y'all feel that this morning oh hallelujah hallelujah now when elijah hallelujah when elijah after his whole heart's desire was to get that promise he wanted the promise that was his motive that was his all that was his life that was his intent everything all everything hung on getting that promise i'm persuaded to believe that we're not sincere about this thing that we're talking about if your whole motives are this morning rest upon giving god praise for my healing if your whole motives this morning rest upon giving god praise for my healing you say i'm determined to be healed by the power of god i'm determined to live a christian life i'm determined to walk in peace with god i'm determined to do it i don't care what mother says what the church says what the pastor says what anybody else says what the world says i'm determined that's the singleness of my heart then you're going to get somewhere then and then when elijah saw that he was determined to get elijah elijah saw that elisha was determined and he gave him the promise now the promise was if thou can see me when i go if you can see me when i leave it's left up to elijah he wanted to hear the promise so he's got the promise now there's an if in it and if you can see me when i go if you can see me when i go now if you're sick this morning and you want to be healed i can prove to you that christ gave you the promise hallelujah how many's been afflicted in the last week been sick everybody's scared to raise their hand right now i don't want anybody seeing know what their hands up i'm afraid my gosh somebody think i got the coronavirus well in your heart you know if you've been sick or not i know well it's allergies it's just that time of season it ain't the corona let me read it to you now if you're sick this morning and you want to be healed i can prove to you christ gave you the promise the promise is yours the promise is yours if thou can't believe if thou can't believe all things are possible i can prove to you by the bible if you can't believe if you can let your faith loose hallelujah now if god's got a purpose in holding this in for five months he's got a purpose in his children receiving it hallelujah you believe that tonight that god has so perfectly planned everything out that he's committed to his purpose and he would not allow his minister to drop that germ of life to you except for at an appointed time esther you have come to this church for such a time as this this god that i'm being introduced to you today is the god of omnipotence watch these things elijah's watching how elijah acts he's watching everything that is going on in elijah's life but he's watching the god of elijah elisha knew that this was more than a man that this was more than a man that would go down there and stop this stop the reigns that this was more than a man that would that would tell tell a widow that she was going to have as i have a son that he would tell her that that you're going to live that your burial shall not be empty this was more than a man that that could stop the rain this was more than a man that could call down fire from heaven but he was watching that god this morning if you could get your eyes on him brother branham said now i wasn't the one down there at the river he said it wasn't the seventh angel it was the mighty angel he said i'm just near when he does those things oh hallelujah this morning if you could get your eyes off of the circumstances of life get your eyes off what you see and look past your thinking and watch the god of the bible he's active he's alive he's moving there's a force that is behind his word there's a force that's behind it and elijah was watching these things as he walks over with his servant elijah as he's watching as elijah crosses that river and he don't walk over on wet man let land or muddy land he walks over on dry ground elisha is watching all of these events as they're taking place that this has got to be the god of omnipotence now i have to say to you i enjoy hearing about the miracles i honestly i'll sit back and i'll listen to the prayer lines because and i'll listen to those things as they're going forth i'm not listening for i'm not listening to to glorify a man but i'm listening to watch that god of miraculous show up and discern the very thoughts and the intents of the heart these things they're available to us and though we may not be a prophet in our own ministry but there is a living word there is a living god and i believe there's a living people that are accessing that same word this morning if i didn't believe that i wouldn't be standing here but i want to tell you that these things just like you go down to the go down to food line you can go down to walmart you can go down to target you can go everywhere you want to and they may be out of toilet paper but god ain't out of his promises god ain't running out of lysol he's still got a blood he ain't running out of his elements he running out of essentials the only thing that is essential in this day is this god they got a thing called essential oil and the only essential oil that there is is the baptism of the holy ghost [Applause] you watch this scene elijah is taken up by chariots of fire and horses of fire he's caught up in a whirlwind and elisha is watching this this transpires and the mantle of elijah falls down and elijah goes over and grabs it and he walks over to the same river that they just walked across of you see because jordan means death you see elijah had walked over as one man he'd watched over watching elijah he'd watched as everything has transpired but elijah's getting ready to walk back over on the other side you see we look at the other end of the story but there is an omnipotent between this side of elisha and that side of elisha and if i can look at your lives and point out your lives i could point out that there was one there was one vj frasier but now there's another vijay phrase i could point out that there was once this stephen by ours but now there's this stephen buyers what was it there was an omnipotent god that was standing in the gap he was standing there and he's the one that made these things possible you're not here because of me you're not here because a track you're not here because of tape you're here because of him hallelujah hallelujah and he walked over and grabbed that mantle and he grabbed it and he struck the waters and he said where be the god of elijah and the second hand wrote he said but when he come down to the jordan to face the critical world what did he cry where is the god of elijah it wasn't the robe of light it wasn't the robe of elijah that dawn it it was the power of god of elijah that done it and the thing that the world needs this morning is the power of the god of a lot you might have spoke with tongues and shouted and run over the floor but what we need is the power of god of pentecost to produce the lives and things that was lived in that day in the apostolic hour that secondhand it wrote was all right but he needed a fresh call in his heart from god he needed a fresh anointing from god he was he wore a second-handed robe when he come to the river but he needed a brand new first-hand call from god and a first-handed power from god to perform the miracle now pay attention and my brother don't you be afraid to ask god anything you must demand god or ask god for anything that is promised for if i am introducing a god that's omnipotent and all-powerful and if i be a servant of god i must do the works of god and if i do the works of god i must be a man of god to bring these things to pass now this is more than your televangelist right now that is standing up the smiling preacher in texas and would stand there and said i see somebody out on the airwaves and they're dealing with a backache and they're dealing with this where you can receive your healing in the name of jesus christ but here we are watching the omnipotent god be on display if i be the servant of god then i must do the works of god and if i do the works of god i must be a man of god to bring these things to pass because he's demanding of me to produce the impossible i have to ask him i have to call upon him and stand there and say god you promised it just like you have to stand there and so it does every person you shall receive power after the holy spirit doesn't come upon you after the spirit has come upon you after you're robed as a christian after your faith is set in christ then you shall receive power there you are if i am introducing a god of omnipotence you must demand or ask god anything too long too long has men and women set back and set aside and allow their prayer list to get longer yes i'm coming to your address today too long have we sat in this church or said in message churches and we've set there and we've allowed our prayer list to get longer and instead of shorter you have the omnipotent god at your disposal this morning there is a deposit in the bank of heaven oh hallelujah instead of our prayer let's get longer let's start speaking the things that god has said let's watch the omnipotence god show up [Applause] don't you be afraid to ask you must demand god or ask god anything how many times we set back and we just allow things to go through well that's god's will i hit on it last night but i'm gonna hit on it again this morning we step back and say it's god's will for this to happen and it's god's will for that to happen that if god is willing to do it he'll do it do you realize who you are do you realize who you represent satan's not afraid of me but he is afraid of the god that i represent he don't have to mind me but he has to understand and he has to mind the god that i represent [Applause] every sickness has to mind the god that you represent well i just feel like god will do it in his time he knows how everything's going to work out he knows how things are going to transpire he's got a reason in me being sick get over that lying devil god is not willing that any should perish god is not willing that you be sick god is asking you to demand of him what he said he's not asking you to say something that he didn't say i'm preaching to you a god of omnipotence that will back up what he says that will do what he says and i believe if you can let loose of your humanity for a moment and reach out in that spiritual realm you'll realize who you are and you'll say cancer leaf sickness leave trouble leave why do we fall in love with sickness it's because people love attention i don't believe a real i now now i know that every person that gets sick does not mean that they love attention of that but there are people that enjoy being sick you say how is that possible for people to fall in love what are they falling in love with a demon you see some people are so afraid to give prayer they're afraid because if they come up the lord might actually heal them that i have to get rid of that disability check they enjoy setting back and doing nothing there's a lot of americans that have become bums over the last nine ten weeks and they have forgot what they have said it is a cuss word they have forgot w-o-r-k but i'm afraid what i'm preaching to you this morning is i'm afraid that children of god and people of god have forgotten that works is faith expressed that this is the time if there is there was a time that we need to believe in a time that we need to watch god show up it's this time we may never have meetings like we used to have we may not be able to come into service like we used to have we may not be able to do certain things but i can tell you one thing you can believe like never before i believe while we're here we can live in perfect peace while we're here we can overcome the devil we can overcome sickness we can overcome ourselves if i am introducing god of omnipotence i want to ask you something i'm going to need a little class participation on this do you believe that he introduced a god of omnipotence i'll preach to you that believe now now the bible says in 2 peter 1 and 16 for we have not followed cunningly devised fables when we made known unto you the power and the coming of our lord jesus christ but were eyewitnesses of his majesty for he received from god the father honor and glory when there came such a voice from him from the excellent glory saying this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased and this voice which came from heaven we heard when we were with him in the holy mount we have also a more sure word of prophecy whereunto you do well that you take heed as unto the light that shineth in a dark place until the day dawn and the day start arise in your hearts knowing this first that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man but holy men of god speak we are eyewitnesses of these things now i'm going to need a little bit more how many here's got the baptism of the holy ghost don't raise your hand if you ain't got it you know if you ain't got it but raise your hand if you got it all right praise the lord i'm going to give to you what a prophet said he said it's time to take this holy spirit that we're anointed with and say where is the god that was upon jesus christ come on somebody it's a time that we take this holy spirit that we're anointed with and said where is the god that was upon jesus christ he said the works that i do shall you do also you believe that's for you if you believe that's for you you have access to it you ought to take that holy spirit that you're anointed with and say where is the god that was upon jesus christ and you watch the same works that he did you'll do and greater works than these shall you do because i go into my father that if you ask anything in my name i will do it there was a time there was a time when the prophet was standing at the platform he's standing there and there's this little baby he's holding in his arms it's all crippled up his feet's all drawn up arms all drawed up brother branham said no i thought the janitor turned the light on and shined it in my face and he said i kind of thought well that's kind of rude of a person to do a thing like that he said but as i watched i realized that it wasn't a janitor that was doing that but that was the angel of the lord that was a pillar of fire that was coming he said now i don't know what happened he said i don't know where i dropped the baby or not or whether it jumped down my arms he said but when that baby hit the floor its arms went straight out and his feet went straight out and there was and it started running across that altar and it ran over and grabbed a hold of its mama and there was a lady that was over there there was a nazarene woman that was over there playing a piano that the great physician now was near the sympathizing jesus is here and as she seen that event taking place she watched she watched as that was transpiring and that lady that sister jumped off off of that piano and started shouting and speaking in tongues right there but the whole time the piano kept playing the great physician now is near what was it the god that was a healing is the god that knows how to play the piano and the god that is preaching this morning is the god that knows how to receive he knows how to open up he knows how to open up a red sea he knows how to open up a jordan river and he knows how to get a hold of your life he knows how to come to your address he knows how to speak to you on a level that nobody else can speak to you because you have a capacity to be able to receive like nobody else you're the bride of jesus christ the world can't receive it unbelief can't receive it but the bride of jesus christ that knows where she stands knows what she's doing no she's called to this hour has the capacity to be able to receive thus saith the lord and watch that word come to pass she's not afraid she's not ashamed she's not shook up she's watching what he said there was a man that died one time there was a man that died one time and mother branham went over he went over to pay and offer his sympathy to the family he walked in there and there was a methodist preacher and his wife sitting there he's sitting there and brother brandon walks in and offers his sympathy to him and he said he started walking out the door got out on front front porch stood out there and he said a man's hand grabbed a hold of him and he said i turned around and there was no man there he said so i walked back on the inside of that house and he said well i walked over to that bedside and he said i begin he said i begin to pray now i wonder what this methodist preacher thought of this he was getting ready to watch an event that he had probably ever seen maybe never ever see again but here brother branham said i guess i'll just offer prayer he said the next thing i know when i came to myself i was saying brother elijah he said i was laying on top of that dead man's body and he said i was sitting there saying brother elijah brother elijah brother elijah he said there was a dead man underneath of that sheet he said but all of a sudden a hand come around that sheet what was it he was introducing to you a god of omnipotence a god that backs up what he said there was a lady that came through a prayer line one time she told her husband she had cancer in her heart cancer and a colon cancer all through her outer body she told her husband and i said now if i die no matter how bad i get you take me through that prayer line her name was mrs hattie waldrop and she went through that prayer line and they told brother branham we've got a dead lady that's coming through this line he come through there laid his hands on her and she came up out of there what was it proving to you and i that he is the god of omnipotence oh hallelujah there's a lady by the name of lady lady myrick and she had had cancer surgery and they had removed the cancer and the doctors told her they told her family that she's only got days to live brother branham went in there and they told us now don't you tell don't you tell her what she's going to do don't tell her that she's going to die no tell her what she's got brother brandon walked in there she began to speak to him said what is it brother brandon she said he said it's cancer and he only got a few days to live she said i oh i so wanted to lead my family to the lord jesus christ brother branham said you've got an opportunity right now you've been given another opportunity right now and within a few weeks times she was completely whole what was that a man or an omnipotent god come on somebody what was that a man or an omnipotent god hallelujah hallelujah what about you what about your life what about the events that have led and has inspired you to be here this morning you think you're just here because homer fraser and he's dedicated this church and he's part of your family brother homer fraser did not lead you here it was an angel of the lord that directed you here brother homer was just the body to get the germ to you [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah what is this who is this who is this one that's here this morning who is this one that's influencing us who is this one that is moving us you see elisha was a witness of what the power of god could do and he walked down there and smote the waters and he says where be the god of elijah where be the god of elijah this morning i want you to ask a question where is the god of elijah at if he's the omnipotent god where's that god at you see he was a witness and we are witnesses that the lame can walk that the blind can see that the dead can raise sister jenny you weren't here that night i don't i don't recall that you were here but your father as far as i'm concerned was a dead man sitting in that pew everything was a holy hush at that moment you'll hear some of these things in the upcoming weeks but there brother doug hill you were sitting here and you watched as the whole congregation was under a holy hush that was your daddy how was your daddy that was your father-in-law what if he didn't show up we'd had a nice funeral we'd said great words because i believe great words should be said over a great man but i'm ever so glad that i didn't have to preach brother dog's funeral what you're looking at today as far as i'm concerned is a dead man that's been raised back from the life now you can tell me all you want to and the religions of the world and people and even what they call my friends have tried to tell me that this god don't do those things no more if you're trying to tell me that you're not my friend but i'm a proof and i'm a witness that this omnipotent god lives rules and reigns i've looked at your life i looked at these miracles and this is none other than jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you believe that angel's here this morning you know he's got angels that are commissioned with healing i believe there's an angel i believe there's an angel watching over you it's watching over your situation you believe that i believe there's an angel of healing that is commissioned by almighty god we watch that angel work in this day like no other day we see more miracles that happen in this day than what even happened in the life of jesus christ because these are the greater works not greater in quality but greater in quantity we are watching the same jesus that walk the shores of galilee that walked down there and healed a leper we've seen that same god raise a man that had every vertebrae in his back broke i've watched that god i've watched that god when doctors told me when they doctors told me that he'll never preach again and they told me that he'll never be able to walk again i've watched that same god say or the same devil say that that he'll never be able to work like he used to i've heard doctors say that he won't be able to function like he used to i've heard all kinds of things but i've watched an omnipotent god show up show up show up and i've watched him get the glory there's not one man that stood behind this pulpit that's tried to get the glory because we wouldn't have let a man that would want to give his own glory stand behind this pulpit but there's not been one man stood here and preached the living message of jesus christ that wanted to get the glory for himself but you watched as that minister of god dropped the germ of life and you watch the miraculous take place hallelujah if we are introducing a god of omnipotence then the miraculous has got to vindicate it he's got to vindicate it i believe those angels are here i believe those angels are moving i believe what we've introduced to you is a god of all power we watched as moses would stand there and he would he would instruct the children of israel to look on that brass serpent now it was not the brass it was what it represented but there was an angel there was an angel of healing there just like it was an angel of healing down by the pool of bethesda that was there there was an angel that was on that water it was not the water it was the angel and it is not the man it's the angel these things that we tell you today this is the lord's doing there's elements in your life that i can't describe publicly but you know that if he didn't show up there were certain things that wouldn't happen you'd be stuck in that condition and you'd be far off but god was so strong i've watched i've watched miraculous in front of my very own eyes i've watched i've watched as men that were separated by thousands of miles and i'll watch the miraculous take place i've watched that same god in action and i want to tell you what you're seeing in the natural is what you're going to see in supernatural that we're in a battle right here this morning there is major war that is going on but i want to tell you that we are winning i've watched that same angel of the lord come some people criticize it what they want to say what they want to and say we shouldn't preach these things but i believe i believe what he said that your young men shall see visions and your old men should dream dreams i've watched his visions come to pass in front of you i've been behind the scenes and i've watched the supernatural many of you don't even know it many of things will never be said to you and they can criticize me it's on the internet they can criticize me they can make fun they can say what they want to but i'm going to tell you when he says it when god says it it always comes to pass you see it's a major difference when i say it or when i maybe feel an impulse because what he said but when he says it there are things that have come out of these mortal lifts and i thought oh god if you don't back that up if you don't back that up if that was me i will be exposed as just another ordinary man but i realize that i yielded myself a long time ago to his sovereign will and i've watched his visions that were told in the background and you had no clue what would take place standing back there in that back office there would be things said that would transpire during a service like this morning and i'd sit in that seat right there and i'd watch it perfectly come to pass now who is that is that ron spencer is that the god of omnipotence hallelujah i'm just saying brother ron never stood here and tried to produce his own ministry and tried to stand there and say that these visions were of himself brother ron spencer stood behind this pulpit on thus saith the lord and by his perfect will almighty god's will said that this vision has said this and as far as i'm concerned sister anna the baby's already coming [Applause] sister mary you can go ahead and plan to be grandma again cause the baby's coming the vision's coming there was a vision years ago years ago that brother homer brother ron and brother andrew would lead this church right into the rapture and i've got to tell you that the vision is going to come to pass there ain't going to be no hell there ain't going to be no spirit of disease going to stop us from going in this rapture there's a god on my side there's a god that's backing us up there's a god of omnipotence the vision has been spoken oh glorify the lord with me come exalt his name together why stay there in that condition say where is the god that was upon jesus christ stop sitting there in that condition start speaking start moving start acting oh if you just fall in love with jesus if you just fall in love with his will he'll do his part there's ah there's a lot of parents are sitting here and the musicians can come there's a lot of parents sitting here and sometimes you don't even mean to do it but sometimes in your own parenthood you show favoritism over one child or the other you don't mean to do it it just happens maybe you'll give a little more piece of candy to this one or a little piece of candy to that one that's my favorite one you don't mean to do it sometimes that's just what parents do sometimes it's what you're closest to why'd you give her that why didn't you give me that why did you do that why'd you do this why'd you do that sometimes you just do things like that and you show favoritism you didn't mean to do it but parents show favoritism sometimes but god never does and if you come to him the same way that the widow of nain came if you come to him the same way that that dirty leper came to him came if you come to him the same way that the one with the blood as you came you see you'll get the same results you'll get the same results because you see god will back up his part if you'll do your part i'll give the lord praise where is the god that was upon jesus christ he's here he's here now i don't know specifically god don't tell me everything and god don't show me everything i don't know exactly why god would allow just this word to be released in this moment but i want you to be sensitive as a people to understand that are certain things as i as a man would love to preach i enjoy to preach but god had a reason in holding this off so i don't want you to think of myself or think of anything but i want you to think about the element of god that god would wait at such a season to deposit this that god would place this in your lap at this time now you'll walk out of those doors and you'll go have your sunday dinner but what will you do with this will it go through your mind i want you to eat i want you to eat on these things your children have heard these things your children are understanding more than maybe what you understand or what you even think they're catching there's going to be some questions that will come up in your children's life and it's this god that will answer want you to reflect on these things and realize that god had a purpose he had to bring you to this spot this spot in your life to be able to release a certain situation you see because the bible said that he had a need to go by samaria he's got a need this morning to speak these things so specifically in such in a manner that he turned the diamond just enough so you could see him this morning don't see me don't see brother ron don't see brother homer don't see this church see jesus because i'm gonna fade away that gray hair keeps coming in faster and then i can count them but if time terries i'm going to leave here maybe down in the future some if time would tear i don't think we got much longer i really don't i see i see nothing that is left to be undone except for the change of the body but if time would tarry and go down the road there'll be some other man standing behind this pulpit but don't see the man don't see me don't see sister cassie don't see brother matthew that they're playing their parts see jesus that is you see if you'll fall in love with jesus it'll take care of everything this ain't about me this ain't about you this ain't about anybody this is about him oh magnify the lord with me is that what you want to do this morning this is the year that we will see miracles but
