[41:31] basically they revived him
[41:33] at the ct scan did a
[41:36] opened his chest back up and
[41:38] and so
[41:40] he's in a he's in a tough spot
[41:43] couldn't be in a better stop spot with
[41:45] jesus though and that's
[41:47] that's that's the main thing that we
[41:49] look at that we're we're we're when it's
[41:52] a little bit out of the doctor's hands
[41:53] it's right in the hands of our lord
[41:55] jesus and so
[41:57] pray for sister denise and the family
[41:59] there uh they're there they got to go in
[42:01] and see him today
[42:03] uh for just a few moments i believe and
[42:06] they
[42:06] and so if you remember them in a special
[42:08] way the next 24 hours is very critical
[42:12] and uh
[42:13] and so if you remember that i think
[42:15] they've given the report this afternoon
[42:17] and i don't know these numbers brother
[42:19] nathaniel but about 15 of his heart is
[42:22] working
[42:23] and so
[42:25] so if you remember that in prayer that
[42:27] god would do a work we've seen what god
[42:29] can do
[42:32] just to give you a bit of encouragement
[42:33] and maybe sister denise is watching even
[42:36] now
[42:36] brother ralph walls
[42:39] about 12 of his heart was working so
[42:42] and he's lived for several years and so
[42:45] we just are asking the lord to just come
[42:47] and do a work
[42:49] amen i would like for you to remember a
[42:51] family a friend of mine passed away this
[42:53] week his name was jack trump he was a
[42:55] business mentor when i was a young man
[42:58] passed away he was 84 years old he did a
[43:01] lot of phenomenal things to them to the
[43:03] community and uh was quite a man he was
[43:06] quite an incredible fella i he he
[43:09] actually he was kind of like a second
[43:11] daddy to me
[43:12] through the years he was a kind of a
[43:14] fellow that would that would keep up
[43:16] with you and
[43:17] and uh he felt like i was his son and so
[43:19] every month he would call to see how he
[43:22] was doing and so
[43:24] brother boyce took me to the wake on
[43:29] thursday thursday night and and we were
[43:32] there that kind of took me back a few
[43:34] decades to
[43:36] to a time before marriage
[43:38] and uh some good some bad
[43:41] but when i received the lord jesus
[43:44] christ
[43:45] it made such an impact on jack
[43:49] until he made a move towards the lord
[43:52] and so and so we we had many discussions
[43:55] on that
[43:56] and um he never saw this
[43:59] but he became a christian and so i want
[44:01] to remember his family i know i know
[44:03] them well and so i you know but i
[44:07] as i came home and i was thinking about
[44:09] it as i came home
[44:11] i'm a different man now
[44:15] and that man is not the man that i know
[44:18] he was a young guy many of you saw that
[44:21] fella he was red-headed he was younger
[44:23] had a lot of energy he was a lot
[44:25] skinnier
[44:26] but he was a different man
[44:29] and i would rather live with the man
[44:30] that lives on the inside of me
[44:34] now do you understand that
[44:38] the quality of life is extremely
[44:40] different
[44:42] amen to know jesus means more than the
[44:44] world
[44:46] amen on a good note i'm not going to say
[44:49] where but brother caleb
[44:51] from
[44:53] was released
[44:54] from prison
[44:56] and he is the last pastor out of that
[44:58] out of that nation
[45:00] that is released and he is free
[45:03] and he's now back as being a pastor of
[45:05] that church and so
[45:16] and
[45:17] and so we're i'm thrilled
[45:19] i i may show you a picture in the
[45:21] morning and and uh and so we're
[45:24] certainly thrilled for caleb that he's
[45:26] home with his family with his church and
[45:28] he's a lot skinnier now but
[45:31] he's a wonderful young man and i want
[45:33] you to i want to remind you this he
[45:35] believes this message just like you do
[45:38] but he lives in a nation that'll put him
[45:40] in prison for it
[45:42] and there's a congregation that goes to
[45:44] church every sunday with the risk of
[45:47] being in prison tomorrow
[45:50] and so and so
[45:52] when you think about this message
[45:56] some are paying an incredible cost and
[45:59] i sent the picture to our family and i
[46:01] said here is a book of acts man
[46:04] that just stepped out of prison for
[46:05] preaching the same message that i preach
[46:09] and he believes it with all of his heart
[46:13] arrested
[46:14] for carrying bibles
[46:16] and and getting bibles into the hands of
[46:19] believers and so
[46:20] and so i i think it was about five of
[46:23] the ministers there that were doing it
[46:25] and they would send letters home to
[46:27] their wives
[46:28] don't give up you press on don't miss a
[46:31] day
[46:32] some of their letters were like reading
[46:34] the book of acts and and so god bless
[46:37] brother caleb
[46:38] in a special way and i just pray that
[46:41] his protection hand would be upon him in
[46:45] the coming days and coming weeks
[46:47] as they go back to work in the kingdom
[46:49] of god and so
[46:51] amen and so we believe that with all
[46:53] your hearts
[46:55] i got up this morning and as a the
[46:57] sermon that we're getting ready to
[46:59] preach
[47:00] this
[47:01] was my devotion that i read this morning
[47:05] one of them
[47:07] proverbs chapter 10 and verse 12
[47:10] hatred stirreth up strifes
[47:14] but love
[47:15] coverth all sins
[47:20] the writer writes it
[47:22] let's face it we all enjoy a juicy bit
[47:25] of gossip now and then
[47:29] as wrong as that scenes most of us are
[47:32] guilty for stirring the pot
[47:35] at one time or another
[47:38] it's not the worst thing that we can do
[47:40] right
[47:42] but god's word tells us that gossip
[47:46] is more indicative of hatred
[47:48] than love
[47:51] words can do more damage than any amount
[47:54] of physical harm
[47:56] gossip hurts
[47:59] it tears down it wounds our spirits
[48:03] i want you to notice that statement it
[48:05] wounds our spirits
[48:09] it causes deep pain
[48:11] which can take years to heal
[48:15] and sometimes its wounds never heal
[48:19] this side of eternity
[48:22] love always protects
[48:25] it always heals it always builds up
[48:29] sometimes it's necessary to reveal
[48:32] hurtful
[48:33] information but more often
[48:35] we can just
[48:37] let those these
[48:39] go and protect those around us
[48:42] from hurtful comments
[48:44] we can keep our mouths shut
[48:47] quit stirring the pot let conflicts die
[48:50] before they begin
[48:52] or at least we can choose not to
[48:55] contribute to the conflict
[48:57] [Music]
[48:59] hatred
[49:00] fans the flames of controversy
[49:03] dissension without
[49:05] concern
[49:07] for who is hurt
[49:09] love on the other hand covers
[49:12] over wrongs
[49:14] when love is exercised conflict can be
[49:17] smothered before the damage
[49:20] gets out of control
[49:23] i thought that was pretty powerful
[49:26] let's stand and have church
[49:31] amen
[49:36] ruth chapter 3 and verse 1
[49:41] and we're going to look at staying in
[49:43] the field
[49:44] and this is going to be the field of
[49:46] forgiveness
[49:48] hallelujah
[49:55] let's talk to the master just before we
[49:58] we read the book just now
[50:00] heavenly father we bow our heads before
[50:02] you now

[50:28] beyond even their capabilities

[50:34] and we ask you now that you would come
[50:36] on the scene for brother harold
[50:38] we pray that you would stretch forth
[50:40] your hand to mercy

[50:44] season to go

[50:58] study we can lay aside time try to find
[51:00] the right atmosphere to speak the word

[51:05] uppermost seat of this house feed us as
[51:08] the great shepherd yourself minister to
[51:11] us in a mighty way and whomever will
[51:14] hear these words tonight lord let it go
[51:17] to the very pivotal place that it needs
[51:20] to go we ask in jesus christ's name we
[51:23] pray amen and amen and amen
[51:26] then naomi her mother-in-law said unto
[51:29] her my daughter
[51:31] shall i not seek
[51:33] rest for thee
[51:35] that it may be well with thee
[51:38] and now is not boaz our kindred
[51:42] with whose maidens thou west
[51:45] behold the winner with barley tonight in
[51:48] the threshing floor
[51:50] wash thyself therefore and anoint
[51:53] thee and put thy raiment upon thee and
[51:56] get thee down to the floor but make not
[51:59] thyself known unto the man until he
[52:02] shall have done eating and drinking
[52:05] and it shall be that when he lieth down
[52:09] that thou shalt mark the place where he
[52:11] shall lie
[52:13] and thou shall go in and uncover his
[52:15] feet and lay down and he will tell thee
[52:19] what thou shalt do
[52:22] and she said unto her
[52:24] all that thou sayest unto me
[52:27] i will do
[52:29] and she went down to the floor and did
[52:31] according to all that her mother-in-law
[52:33] made her and when boaz had eaten and
[52:36] drunk and his heart was married
[52:39] he went to lie down at the end of the
[52:40] heap of corn and she came softly and
[52:43] uncovered his feet and lay her down and
[52:46] it came to pass at midnight that the man
[52:49] was afraid and turned himself and behold
[52:53] a woman lay at his feet
[52:55] and he said who art thou
[52:57] and she answered i am ruth thine
[53:00] handmaid
[53:02] spread therefore thy skirt over thine
[53:05] handmaid for thou art a near kinsman
[53:10] and he said blessed be thou of the lord
[53:12] my daughter for thou has showed more
[53:15] kindness in the latter end than at the
[53:18] beginning
[53:19] insomuch as thou followest not young men
[53:23] whether poor or rich
[53:25] and now my daughter fear not
[53:28] i will do to thee all that thou
[53:31] requirest
[53:33] for all the city of my people doth know
[53:36] that thou
[53:37] art a virtuous
[53:39] woman
[53:40] you may be seated tonight
[53:46] you know these quotes well brother
[53:47] branham said this in the kinsman
[53:49] redeemer
[53:51] he said they journeyed on
[53:52] ruth and in her heart not knowing where
[53:55] she was going
[53:57] but a type of the church
[53:59] we sojourn like abraham pilgrims in a
[54:02] strange land amongst the strange people
[54:05] and she went and finally she came into
[54:08] the room and the place where naomi was
[54:11] bringing her
[54:12] and she and what did she find everybody
[54:15] patting her on the back and saying ruth
[54:18] we're glad to have you down here
[54:20] she found discord
[54:24] she found something evil she found
[54:26] trouble
[54:28] and the preachers that'll tell you that
[54:30] the christian life is a flower in bed of
[54:32] ease
[54:33] he either is deceiving you or he's never
[54:36] accepted that experience for himself
[54:40] the world hates you
[54:44] and people will hate you
[54:46] and you've got to take the way with the
[54:48] lord's despised view
[54:51] quite a statement in it
[54:53] and being laughed at and made fun of and
[54:55] ever anything else you got to be
[54:57] different
[54:58] you're born of another nation
[55:02] he said now then notice
[55:04] life was hard for her
[55:06] and it's hard
[55:08] after you become a christian because you
[55:11] got to adjust yourself from one life of
[55:14] deity and pleasures of the world to
[55:17] another life of consecration to god
[55:21] personally it's a better life
[55:24] i want to say that to you it's a better
[55:26] life
[55:30] you've got to readjust yourself
[55:33] over into this side
[55:35] and ruth had to adjust herself from
[55:38] being
[55:38] in that land where there was plenty to
[55:41] eat
[55:42] everything was respected to a people
[55:45] that was laughing and making fun of her
[55:49] into a land she gleaned in a field and
[55:52] and what she eat and put it and put it
[55:55] in her scarf and take it home and beat
[55:57] it out and make some bread and her and
[56:00] her mother-in-law
[56:02] eat it
[56:04] young people you go to school and
[56:06] sometimes you're the only one in your
[56:08] school
[56:10] maybe you're as an adult you work in a
[56:13] in a factor where you're the only one in
[56:15] your factory
[56:17] maybe you're the only one in your family
[56:20] and you can feel the rejection you can
[56:23] feel
[56:24] what people are thinking
[56:26] you can feel what people are saying they
[56:28] don't have to say it you can just kind
[56:29] of feel it
[56:31] but let me just say as a christian
[56:33] we raise our head above that
[56:36] [Music]
[56:37] we can either
[56:39] bring ourself and allow ourselves to
[56:41] just flow any away and become a
[56:43] hypocrite
[56:44] or we can conserve create our life to
[56:46] god
[56:48] are you with me now consecrating our
[56:50] life to god
[56:52] and know that this world is not a home
[56:56] we're just a passing through
[56:58] it doesn't matter what our neighbors do
[57:00] us it doesn't matter what a community
[57:02] does it doesn't matter what our
[57:04] government does
[57:05] [Music]
[57:07] are you with me now
[57:09] sure she had a history
[57:11] you did
[57:12] sure she had a past you did
[57:16] she had a first husband so did you
[57:20] your first husband was your nature
[57:24] you were born in sin
[57:28] you're not ruth tonight but you're a
[57:30] type of her
[57:31] you needed a kinsman redeemer
[57:39] he was willing to provide and protect
[57:41] for you
[57:44] and our kinsmen redeemer jesus christ
[57:47] was willing
[57:50] to take on our shame
[57:54] he became sin that we might become his
[57:56] righteousness
[57:58] when we become a christian we realize
[58:00] the blood of jesus christ watches us and
[58:03] the scripture said there is therefore
[58:06] now
[58:06] no condemnation
[58:09] for those of you that had a very stained
[58:11] past this was a powerful scripture for
[58:13] me romans chapter 8 verse 1.
[58:17] sure we had a past but when god looks at
[58:20] your past through the blood of jesus
[58:22] christ he sees it as though you never
[58:25] did it in the first place
[58:28] it is gone in his mind it is only in
[58:31] your channel of your memory to where the
[58:34] accuser of your brethren constantly
[58:36] accuses you but you remind him that the
[58:40] blood of jesus christ washed away that
[58:43] sin
[58:53] she had to be determined that her past
[58:57] was not going to determine her future
[59:03] she had to be determined that her past
[59:07] would not determine her future
[59:11] how many of you as as parents now
[59:15] look back at the no i'm just going to
[59:17] say how how you think it look back at
[59:19] the
[59:20] failures of your parents and you're
[59:22] determined not to do that
[59:28] are you with me now you're determined
[59:31] and through the the conversion of the
[59:33] blood of jesus christ you can break
[59:36] every chain
[59:40] you can't do it by vows and making
[59:42] broken promises but you can buy a new
[59:45] birth
[59:47] become a real father and a real mother
[59:51] and you can look past your own
[59:53] weaknesses
[59:56] and move into his promises
[59:59] you can imagine the deep scars that ruth
[1:00:02] had
[1:00:03] a widow
[1:00:04] being born of lot's descendants the deep
[1:00:07] valors the horrible chapters of her
[1:00:09] books of her life
[1:00:11] the mind battles that she had to go
[1:00:13] through him talking to you too
[1:00:15] the limited thoughts of access of what
[1:00:17] god could do in her life
[1:00:20] but god had plans for her
[1:00:23] she was not just working in a field she
[1:00:26] was the field
[1:00:30] she was not just working in a field she
[1:00:34] was the field that god was going to work
[1:00:37] on
[1:00:38] [Applause]
[1:00:40] now listen
[1:00:41] you might think that you're the only one
[1:00:43] that's suffering persecution and right
[1:00:45] now maybe nobody in this building but
[1:00:47] somebody listening
[1:00:48] susanna wesley
[1:00:50] two houses in her life burned down
[1:00:54] she lost almost everything twice
[1:00:57] had 19 children
[1:00:59] nine would die as infants
[1:01:03] accidentally smothered one
[1:01:05] while she was nursing
[1:01:08] that did not stop her
[1:01:11] her son was one of the most powerful
[1:01:13] preachers that ever lived
[1:01:16] and she wrote most of his sermons with
[1:01:20] him
[1:01:22] are you with me now
[1:01:24] what a powerful woman that she was
[1:01:27] you see she would not allow the
[1:01:30] circumstances of life that it so bound
[1:01:33] her
[1:01:35] to determine what god was going to do in
[1:01:38] her life
[1:01:39] fanny crosby another born blind
[1:01:43] refused to sell her gift of popularity
[1:01:45] of music
[1:01:47] lived in total property wrote
[1:01:50] songs they wanted her to write the
[1:01:53] national anthem they wanted to write a
[1:01:55] lot of different songs for for the music
[1:01:57] world
[1:01:58] but one song that she did right i shall
[1:02:01] know him i shall know
[1:02:04] him i shall know him by the nail prince
[1:02:07] in his hands
[1:02:09] pass me night o gentle savior hear my
[1:02:11] humble cry
[1:02:13] thousands and tens of thousands maybe
[1:02:15] into the millions would walk
[1:02:17] to the altar with that song lyrics that
[1:02:21] was inspiration that came to a woman
[1:02:26] you say brother on women can't do
[1:02:27] anything you've got your eyes crossed up
[1:02:30] and your t's are messed up
[1:02:33] women are the most powerful in the
[1:02:35] scriptures
[1:02:36] god writes through esther he writes
[1:02:38] through ruth
[1:02:39] he writes to rahab
[1:02:42] he raises women from the depth of the
[1:02:44] earth and raises him to be queens
[1:02:47] [Applause]
[1:02:49] you were an outcast of society as well
[1:02:52] thrown out of churches because something
[1:02:54] was in you was calling for something
[1:02:57] greater and people make fun of you as
[1:03:00] you begin to work in this field
[1:03:03] but god was raising you to another level
[1:03:06] this world is not a home we are the
[1:03:09] queen of heaven
[1:03:11] [Applause]
[1:03:24] our past
[1:03:27] aliens
[1:03:29] in this world
[1:03:31] seems like no certain future for some of
[1:03:33] us
[1:03:35] we look at our human frailty
[1:03:38] here i stand as a representative to you
[1:03:42] doctors concerned where i'm standing at
[1:03:45] giving me all different kinds of
[1:03:46] directions
[1:03:48] but i choose to look at the words
[1:03:52] i choose to look at a greater doctor's
[1:03:54] words
[1:03:57] my attitude is to where that god has me
[1:04:00] in the palm of his hands
[1:04:02] i choose to trust him beyond doctor's
[1:04:05] words
[1:04:06] i'm thankful for doctor's words i'm
[1:04:08] thankful for medicine but i'm thankful
[1:04:10] for the words of eternal life
[1:04:12] should i die before mourning i want you
[1:04:15] to understand don't cry for me
[1:04:20] i'll be rejoicing in another land
[1:04:25] sometimes people have plans for you
[1:04:27] that's not god's plans
[1:04:35] you must remain in the field stay there
[1:04:38] be content it's just like what we're
[1:04:41] doing right now
[1:04:43] we're working in the field of the
[1:04:44] message
[1:04:46] we're just before the coming of the lord
[1:04:49] we can see the dispensations changing
[1:04:52] we've turned the corner the wind of
[1:04:54] change has turned
[1:04:55] the season has changed i'm not talking
[1:04:58] about fall to winter but the season has
[1:05:00] changed you can feel the wind changing
[1:05:04] there's something among us as a
[1:05:06] believers
[1:05:07] the angel is among us working
[1:05:11] the bride's revival is happening among
[1:05:13] us and we recognize we're not where we
[1:05:16] were 50 years ago or 20 years ago or
[1:05:18] even 10 years ago but we recognize that
[1:05:21] we're closer to the coming of the lord
[1:05:24] than ever before
[1:05:28] we have stayed in the field we have
[1:05:30] worked some of us have been here 40 50
[1:05:32] years and you've continued to work
[1:05:36] don't never let it become boring don't
[1:05:37] never get discontent with it
[1:05:40] just keep eating the book
[1:05:43] just keep eating those handfuls on
[1:05:45] purpose
[1:05:50] like ruth
[1:05:53] just have some words i want to share
[1:05:54] with you just like ruth you got to keep
[1:05:56] from falling in love
[1:05:59] with the personalities of men
[1:06:03] don't fall in love with elohizer keep
[1:06:05] your eyes only on jesus
[1:06:12] we want to love the men that's preaching
[1:06:14] to us
[1:06:15] but those men didn't save us
[1:06:21] we love brother branham but brother
[1:06:22] branham couldn't save himself
[1:06:25] he was born of a sinful nature just like
[1:06:27] me and you tonight
[1:06:29] i understand that that might go contrary
[1:06:32] to a lot of people but i want you to
[1:06:33] understand brother branham couldn't pay
[1:06:35] for his own sins
[1:06:40] but neither are we just a community
[1:06:42] church
[1:06:44] where we come and get a certain recipe
[1:06:46] and take on a church spirit
[1:06:48] or take on the pastor's spirit we're to
[1:06:51] fall in love with christ
[1:06:53] [Applause]
[1:06:55] and to feed on this word like never
[1:06:57] before
[1:07:00] emotion is wonderful and i love it
[1:07:03] in your marriage you gotta have emotion
[1:07:08] well six of you
[1:07:10] are still happily married and we're
[1:07:12] really glad for you
[1:07:14] [Applause]
[1:07:23] i'm gonna run that by you one more time
[1:07:25] maybe you was asleep maybe you
[1:07:28] but your wife is listening
[1:07:31] emotion is part of your marriage
[1:07:37] let me just describe it to you
[1:07:40] emotion sometimes has worship with it
[1:07:47] i love you
[1:07:49] really
[1:07:51] amen
[1:07:54] you could have said i love you like that
[1:07:55] to an apple
[1:08:00] but when you say it with meaning
[1:08:04] when you worship in church with meaning
[1:08:06] [Applause]
[1:08:08] when it comes from the depths of your
[1:08:10] heart
[1:08:12] when it's more than the service leader
[1:08:15] unction you forward
[1:08:22] we come to church to be inspired
[1:08:25] we come to church to be encouraged
[1:08:28] we come to kurt church to be uplifted
[1:08:31] nobody likes to be talked down to
[1:08:35] [Applause]
[1:08:36] i encourage ministers as they walk
[1:08:38] through this pulpit these people have
[1:08:40] sat here and listened they've got
[1:08:42] doctorals in the message
[1:08:45] don't talk down to them this is the
[1:08:47] bride of jesus christ
[1:08:53] and if a man ever talks down to his wife
[1:08:56] he will never come back here again
[1:09:05] we come here to be inspired
[1:09:08] to be encouraged
[1:09:10] why are you saying that brother ron
[1:09:12] because we get enough of the other from
[1:09:14] the world
[1:09:19] we're the queen of heaven
[1:09:22] and i'm encouraging you to keep the
[1:09:24] course
[1:09:32] it's like esther
[1:09:34] asked her caretaker
[1:09:39] what does the king like
[1:09:45] i'm not here to fall in love with the
[1:09:47] preacher but what does jesus like
[1:09:50] so we want to dress like jesus
[1:09:53] wants us to dress
[1:09:55] and we want to talk like jesus wants us
[1:09:57] to talk
[1:09:59] and we want to live like jesus wants us
[1:10:01] to live
[1:10:05] ruth is going to lay at his feet
[1:10:08] literally to the point to hear him
[1:10:10] breathe
[1:10:11] let me just say if you lay in the
[1:10:13] atmosphere of jesus christ you'll smell
[1:10:16] like a rose of sharon
[1:10:18] god will become personal revelation to
[1:10:20] you and to your children
[1:10:24] i like these words when i fall he lifts
[1:10:26] me up
[1:10:27] when i fail he forgives me when i'm weak
[1:10:30] he is strong
[1:10:32] when i'm lost he is the way when i am
[1:10:34] afraid he is my courage when i stumble
[1:10:37] he leads me when i am hurt he heals me
[1:10:40] when i am broken he mends me when i am
[1:10:43] blind he leads me when i'm hungry
[1:10:46] he feeds me when i face trials he is
[1:10:50] with me when i face persecution he
[1:10:53] shields me when i face problems he
[1:10:55] comforts me
[1:10:58] when i face loss he provides for me when
[1:11:01] i face death he carries me home
[1:11:04] he is god
[1:11:06] he is our kinsman redeemer
[1:11:15] when boaz is going to
[1:11:17] to take ruth
[1:11:20] he has to forgive her past
[1:11:24] he has to look at her and
[1:11:26] and what she is
[1:11:29] she has a house and he has to redeem
[1:11:31] naomi
[1:11:33] the land
[1:11:34] and all that comes with it and then take
[1:11:37] ruth
[1:11:39] as his bride
[1:11:41] now sometimes we want forgiveness
[1:11:46] but she has to have the ability to
[1:11:49] forgive those that's made fun of her
[1:11:51] this time
[1:11:53] as the queen of heaven
[1:11:56] must keep your spirit clean
[1:12:01] trash may come up but you got to keep
[1:12:02] your spirit clean
[1:12:04] your mind might get filthy at times but
[1:12:07] you got to keep your mind clean
[1:12:12] let the sweetness of god
[1:12:14] wash you
[1:12:16] sure you've got to pass but put the pass
[1:12:19] in the burial
[1:12:23] put it in the blood of jesus christ
[1:12:25] don't continue to dig those bones up
[1:12:30] don't glory in the good old days they
[1:12:33] wasn't good
[1:12:37] [Applause]
[1:12:45] i'm going to say it again so i make sure
[1:12:47] it lands don't glory in the good old
[1:12:49] days they wasn't good
[1:12:57] you're a new creation
[1:13:00] you're a new man
[1:13:02] you're a new lady
[1:13:03] your scars are healed
[1:13:05] now god don't just do that to just see
[1:13:07] if he can do it but now you've got to
[1:13:10] exercise forgiveness
[1:13:12] somebody does you wrong forgive them but
[1:13:14] brother on it hurts so bad but god tells
[1:13:17] you to forgive 70 times 7 a day
[1:13:22] 490 times a day
[1:13:26] it may not fix them but it'll help you
[1:13:30] [Applause]
[1:13:42] ruth had to choose to raise her head
[1:13:44] above
[1:13:45] them
[1:13:47] brother branham had to choose to raise
[1:13:49] his head above all of those ministers
[1:13:52] that were making fun of him
[1:13:54] [Applause]
[1:13:56] let me just say they wasn't paying him
[1:13:59] they may have been doctors of divinity
[1:14:01] they may have been powerful preachers of
[1:14:03] great denominations
[1:14:06] but they didn't call him it was an angel
[1:14:09] in a cave from another dimension
[1:14:12] that stood with him and regardless of
[1:14:15] what their words were he could have
[1:14:17] lowered himself to their standards but
[1:14:19] he raised his head above that
[1:14:22] [Applause]
[1:14:24] by the biscuit marvel that
[1:14:27] people saying things about brother
[1:14:28] branham that were destructive
[1:14:31] and he asked brother branham one day
[1:14:34] how do you do that
[1:14:37] and brother branham responds and i'm
[1:14:39] just paraphrasing
[1:14:40] he said
[1:14:42] they have to do those things
[1:14:46] because they're called to do it
[1:14:52] and these things
[1:14:53] must be
[1:14:56] brother bishop said i i realized i
[1:14:58] wasn't living at his level
[1:15:01] and we're all in growth
[1:15:04] and let me just say we all have not
[1:15:05] handled things well at times
[1:15:08] it says clean the slate there's been
[1:15:10] times where none of us handle things
[1:15:12] well
[1:15:14] and it's easy to get a fighting spirit
[1:15:17] [Music]
[1:15:22] i have to tell you it's easy to get a
[1:15:24] fighting spirit but you can either lower
[1:15:27] yourself arrange yourself
[1:15:29] [Applause]
[1:15:31] brother ron i need a i need i need an
[1:15:33] example okay
[1:15:39] jesus allows them to spit on him
[1:15:43] to say every evil thing that they could
[1:15:45] be on his way to the cross
[1:15:52] because he's got you on him on his mind
[1:15:56] and he cannot lure himself
[1:15:59] to who they are
[1:16:02] to lose his position it's kinsmen
[1:16:05] redeemer
[1:16:08] and their vileness of trying to make him
[1:16:11] stop
[1:16:15] to go to calvary
[1:16:17] satan is throwing his wrath at him
[1:16:20] so quickly and so vile and so putrid
[1:16:25] to try to make him step out of his
[1:16:27] position what about us
[1:16:31] what about us we're so close to the
[1:16:32] rapture satan is trying to throw his
[1:16:35] wrath and his vow and he's working this
[1:16:38] on
[1:16:40] these things must be
[1:16:45] they must
[1:16:46] be even jesus return he said blessed is
[1:16:50] he that is not offended in me
[1:16:57] whew
[1:17:02] is freely given
[1:17:06] jesus expresses this
[1:17:09] with a woman that's caught in adultery
[1:17:11] and the scripture said she's supposed to
[1:17:12] be stoned
[1:17:14] but the preachers that brought
[1:17:16] her by the offense even to tempt jesus
[1:17:19] with it
[1:17:22] jesus writes on the ground
[1:17:24] and he said he that is without sin
[1:17:27] cast the first stone
[1:17:37] i want to i want to present a thought to
[1:17:39] you
[1:17:42] if they had a throat of stone
[1:17:44] jesus could have just simply told
[1:17:47] what they were doing
[1:17:49] last tuesday
[1:17:54] and then they would be stoned
[1:18:01] so they were convicted by their own
[1:18:03] conscience
[1:18:08] a woman comes in to wash jesus's feet
[1:18:12] now jesus lets her wash his feet
[1:18:15] but he exercises forgiveness
[1:18:18] nobody in the scriptures had ever did it
[1:18:21] he exercises forgiveness
[1:18:24] and he said simon and he rebuked simon
[1:18:30] because simon had brought him there to
[1:18:32] make fun of him
[1:18:33] but now the wheels are turned
[1:18:39] and simon was red-faced and he looks at
[1:18:41] the woman and he said though our sins be
[1:18:43] many
[1:18:46] he says go thy way
[1:18:48] and sin no more now the difference
[1:18:50] between what jesus can do and what man
[1:18:52] can do it's kind of like a credit card
[1:18:56] a man's got 25 000 on his credit card
[1:18:59] he'll never get that paid off
[1:19:01] you pay the minimum you'll never get
[1:19:03] that paid off i don't care what your
[1:19:04] debtor tells you you'll never get it
[1:19:06] paid off if you only pay the minimum
[1:19:09] i don't mean to make you mad here but
[1:19:12] maybe i'll repeat teach a business class
[1:19:15] credit card is one of the worst things
[1:19:17] that you can possibly ever get yourself
[1:19:19] enslaved to
[1:19:22] if you can't pay it off every 30 days
[1:19:26] you don't need that baby doll
[1:19:29] stick it burn it put it in the freezer
[1:19:31] do whatever get rid of that thing and
[1:19:34] don't become a slave to it
[1:19:38] but somebody can pay your debt off
[1:19:42] but if you're not changed you go right
[1:19:44] back out and begin to make new debt
[1:19:49] [Applause]
[1:19:53] now notice jesus didn't shame the woman
[1:19:55] for being in a situation the woman at
[1:19:58] the well he didn't shame her for being
[1:19:59] in that situation
[1:20:01] he raised her
[1:20:04] from where she was
[1:20:08] to where she could be
[1:20:10] that's what god did for you
[1:20:14] he didn't shame you and make fun of you
[1:20:17] and beat you and frail you
[1:20:20] he raised you from where you was
[1:20:23] and he showed you what you could be
[1:20:26] and he gave you the ability
[1:20:34] we've got some examples
[1:20:37] hosea in the scriptures
[1:20:39] is standing at an auction
[1:20:41] he's reflecting god
[1:20:44] and he buys a harlot because that's what
[1:20:47] a type of the church was
[1:20:50] a harlot church to man's systems
[1:20:55] and many of us were in harlot systems
[1:20:58] but god was rich in mercy
[1:21:03] he didn't leave us where he found us
[1:21:06] [Applause]
[1:21:10] hallelujah
[1:21:12] and you found your way to the field
[1:21:14] because he guided you there
[1:21:17] [Applause]
[1:21:19] you say god's never did nothing for me i
[1:21:21] want you to know look where you are and
[1:21:24] look where you were
[1:21:36] many people come to opportunity of life
[1:21:40] same opportunity that you had
[1:21:44] and they walked away
[1:21:46] but you can never wash jesus off of your
[1:21:48] hands
[1:21:50] it leaves souls haunted
[1:21:53] they'll go out in sin
[1:21:55] but that righteousness that that real
[1:21:57] life
[1:21:58] always is pulling back they want to do
[1:22:00] better they want to do better
[1:22:03] maybe show up in church a couple weeks a
[1:22:05] year i want to do better i want to i'm
[1:22:08] making promises i'm never going to leave
[1:22:10] this again
[1:22:11] let me just say unless you go far enough
[1:22:13] with christ you'll always be going back
[1:22:17] and there's nothing forgive me but
[1:22:19] there's nothing in the hog pin
[1:22:24] this world is a hog pin compared to what
[1:22:27] god's beauty feels
[1:22:31] just read the newspaper the stabbings
[1:22:33] and
[1:22:34] just at that rock concert the other day
[1:22:36] were about eight or ten people died
[1:22:40] because the guy was screaming to him
[1:22:42] make a stampede and they make a stampede
[1:22:44] and they started stampeding under that
[1:22:46] spirit and destroyed people's lives
[1:22:51] now the guy calls himself innocent for
[1:22:53] doing it
[1:22:54] an inspiration from hell
[1:22:58] it feeds on the flesh that it makes fun
[1:23:00] of
[1:23:02] [Music]
[1:23:04] they don't want cops they don't want
[1:23:05] police officers
[1:23:09] they don't want judges they don't want
[1:23:11] lawfulness they don't want headship
[1:23:14] we're coming to a lawless society that's
[1:23:17] going into a tribulation period
[1:23:19] yet the people that are saying we don't
[1:23:21] want police officers or are getting
[1:23:23] private security
[1:23:29] and i read the other day that the
[1:23:30] kardashians spend a half a million
[1:23:33] dollars a month to be protected
[1:23:37] i don't want that kind of fame
[1:23:44] wouldn't mind having a half a million
[1:23:46] dollars a month but
[1:23:48] no i wouldn't either and i don't want
[1:23:49] that
[1:23:54] you say but i've grieved my soul away
[1:23:55] brother brown gives an example of a
[1:23:57] woman that
[1:23:59] you know she left his church made fun of
[1:24:01] things and she wound up and she wound up
[1:24:03] to another church and they made her a
[1:24:05] sunday school teacher
[1:24:07] she left one husband married another and
[1:24:08] left one husband married another one
[1:24:10] from church to church and church but
[1:24:12] brother brown lived long enough to watch
[1:24:14] that woman feel her cycle up
[1:24:16] and she came to die
[1:24:19] and she came to die
[1:24:21] brother bam said that her soul came back
[1:24:24] haunting her
[1:24:26] because she knew what was right
[1:24:29] and she carnerized her conscience
[1:24:33] i'm preaching to somebody she cauterized
[1:24:36] her conscience to where it was seared
[1:24:40] to where it wouldn't bother her no more
[1:24:43] let me just say the devil will talk to
[1:24:44] you into smoking one cigarette and then
[1:24:46] you'll do it on your own
[1:24:48] he'll talk you into committing adultery
[1:24:50] one time and then you'll do it on your
[1:24:52] own he'll talk you into drinking wine
[1:24:54] the first time and then you'll do it on
[1:24:56] your own
[1:24:59] you want you want go listen to from that
[1:25:01] time that's where that all comes from
[1:25:04] but you don't have to go there
[1:25:17] brother brahm said the god of the bible
[1:25:20] will make you like jesus
[1:25:23] his spirit will dwell in you and all of
[1:25:25] your life will be changed
[1:25:28] that temper
[1:25:29] that malice
[1:25:32] that unforgiven spirit
[1:25:35] that thing
[1:25:36] will canker your soul
[1:25:40] in a lost eternity
[1:25:44] he said brother ron i'm still carrying
[1:25:45] i'm still carrying grudges in my life
[1:25:49] let me just say ruth had to lay her
[1:25:51] grudges down and her unforgiving spirit
[1:25:53] down to where she could be the queen
[1:25:57] to be the queen of heaven
[1:26:00] you've got to overcome yourself and let
[1:26:02] me just say your own worst enemy is
[1:26:05] yourself
[1:26:09] the men that came to take brother
[1:26:10] branham's newspaper and his his radio
[1:26:13] programs and all of those things away
[1:26:15] from him
[1:26:16] brother branham knew what those papers
[1:26:18] were
[1:26:20] he acted ignorant and went on and signed
[1:26:23] them anyway
[1:26:26] he told brothers before they came
[1:26:30] of what they were going to do to him
[1:26:32] and he signed them

[1:27:23] when they were offering him
[1:27:26] the phenomenal amounts of money
[1:27:28] brother biscuit saw the check for a
[1:27:31] million dollars
[1:27:34] brother branham said what could i do
[1:27:36] with that
[1:27:37] i want to ask you
[1:27:39] i dare say there's a hundred percent of
[1:27:41] the televangelists today

[1:27:45] would turn it down
[1:27:57] none of them would turn it

[1:29:02] and i'm not talking about the salary of
[1:29:04] a church

[1:30:06] that one lie but if you're honest
[1:30:08] [Music]

[1:30:12] folks if you live an honest life you
[1:30:14] don't have to cover up no place in your
[1:30:16] life
[1:30:17] somebody ought to shout hallelujah
[1:30:29] ruth had critics
[1:30:32] but she didn't let her critics
[1:30:35] destroy her
[1:30:38] jesus had critics
[1:30:41] but she didn't let her critics he didn't
[1:30:44] let his critics destroy him
[1:30:47] brother branham had critics

[1:30:55] young people i want to point to every
[1:30:56] one of you tonight and i want you to
[1:30:58] know

[1:31:11] look around at some of these gray heads
[1:31:22] i would rather set where earnest meta
[1:31:24] sets
[1:31:27] than donald trump
[1:31:33] i would rather set where bill hinkle
[1:31:35] sits
[1:31:36] vernon frazier sets
[1:31:38] these pillars in this church sets

[1:31:52] aisle i'd rather sit where linda hinkle
[1:31:54] and kathy and pat and these sister sucks
[1:31:59] sister joyce and sister evelyn than any
[1:32:01] hollywood movie star that there is in
[1:32:04] the world

[1:32:39] i know this hadn't been no lightning
[1:32:41] dancing thunder rolling
[1:32:43] sermon
[1:32:46] but this is this is the feeding
[1:32:49] the feeding of the word that strengthens
[1:32:51] you amen
[1:32:54] it's the nuts and bolts preaching that
[1:32:56] keeps you straight
[1:32:58] now i want to be very honest with you in
[1:33:00] the secrecy of my prayers i pray
[1:33:02] god keep my spirit clean
[1:33:12] my water that comes out of a well we
[1:33:14] have filters on that water brother
[1:33:15] jonathan put some water some filters on
[1:33:17] my water
[1:33:19] i had filters i had several filters on
[1:33:21] it
[1:33:23] because in in having a filter
[1:33:26] you get the sediments out of it
[1:33:28] and you want to drink clean
[1:33:32] and when it comes to the word of god i
[1:33:34] don't want malice and envy and hatred
[1:33:36] and temper and an unforgiving spirit to
[1:33:40] be the filter on my holy ghost
[1:33:45] even in my prayer i want to be able to
[1:33:47] forgive
[1:33:50] that's the lord's prayer forgive your
[1:33:52] trespassers
[1:33:54] forgive those that do evil against you
[1:33:58] now
[1:34:00] it may never do them no good and you may
[1:34:02] never see no change in them

[1:34:10] amen and let me just drop one more
[1:34:12] nugget to you it'll bring you
[1:34:15] peace

[1:34:24] many
[1:34:25] many marriages are built
[1:34:28] that forget the golden rule never go to
[1:34:31] the bed with an argument
