[43:01] for your kingdom in Jesus name amen and
[43:04] amen amen if you have your Bibles this
[43:07] evening or this morning we'd like to
[43:09] look over into a few portions of
[43:11] scripture uh Hebrews chapter
[43:14] 2 and then to 1 Corinthians chapter 5
[43:18] then also Revelations chapter 6 I'd like
[43:21] to reintroduce myself I'm brother Andrew
[43:25] Spencer
[43:27] it's hard to believe it's been a month
[43:29] since we've been behind the pull pit
[43:30] preaching and and uh so last time I was
[43:34] speaking I was in Belgium and I had a
[43:36] translator with me so I asked brother
[43:38] William if he could do my translation
[43:40] today in Romanian
[43:44] so he's not as willing
[43:50] as but we're very happy to be here and I
[43:52] have some things that the lord has laid
[43:54] on our heart and and and um I thank you
[43:57] for bearing with us and allowing us to
[43:59] have brother Tim and brother Donnie here
[44:01] last weekend and just felt those things
[44:03] on our heart and we seen we' seen the
[44:06] benefits of it all so it wasn't that I
[44:08] was trying to neglect my duty here
[44:10] behind this Pulpit but I just felt led
[44:13] as a leader here to do those things and
[44:15] so I believe that we've touched the the
[44:18] the kingdom of God and I believe that
[44:20] we've we we've stirred his heart and I
[44:22] believe that God's going to do spiritual
[44:25] things right here
[44:26] amongst us amen amen Hebrews chapter 2
[44:30] and verse 1 therefore we ought to give
[44:34] the more Earnest heed to the things
[44:37] which we have heard lest at any time we
[44:40] should let them slip for if the word
[44:43] spoken by Angels was steadfast and every
[44:46] transgression and
[44:48] Disobedience received a just recompense
[44:50] of reward how shall we escape if we
[44:55] neglect so great of Salvation so we
[44:57] don't want to neglect these things we
[44:59] want to diligently stand before them how
[45:01] are we going to escape if we neglect so
[45:04] great a Salvation which at the first
[45:06] began to be spoken by the Lord and was
[45:09] confirmed unto us by them that heard him
[45:13] also 1 Corinthians chapter 5 and verse
[45:24] 7
[45:27] 1 Corinthians 5:7 Paul says here Purge
[45:30] out therefore the old leaven that you
[45:34] may be a new lump as ye are unleavened
[45:38] for even Christ Our Passover is
[45:41] sacrificed for us therefore let us keep
[45:44] the feast not with old leaven neither
[45:46] with the leaven of malice and wickedness
[45:50] but with the unleavened bread of
[45:52] sincerity and Truth also Revelations
[45:56] chapter 6 and verse
[46:11] 7 amen and when he had opened the fourth
[46:15] seal I heard the voice of the fourth
[46:18] Beast say come and see and I looked and
[46:22] behold a Pale Horse and his name that
[46:25] sat on him was death and Hell Followed
[46:29] him now if you you're very keen on the
[46:32] message you're very aware that this is
[46:34] the only time that this Rider is titled
[46:38] but notice who it is it is the anointing
[46:41] that names this Rider and behold a Pale
[46:44] Horse and his name that sat on him was
[46:46] death and Hell Followed him and power
[46:50] was given unto him over the fourth part
[46:52] of the earth to kill with the sword and
[46:55] with hunger and with death and with the
[46:58] Beast of the earth may God bless his
[47:00] word you may be seated today in the
[47:02] presence of the Lord I would like to
[47:05] speak to you today on a thought that the
[47:07] Lord laid on my heart while I was there
[47:09] in Belgium actually just during a
[47:11] conversation I was having with Brother
[47:13] David Iverson the Lord be to deal with
[47:15] me and I told sister Katie that I felt
[47:17] like everything that I'd give out in
[47:19] that meeting sitting down the angel of
[47:22] the Lord just sitting down at the table
[47:23] with me and Brother David and the Lord
[47:25] just begin to pour in things to us there
[47:28] and just completely I felt like I told
[47:30] her that I I felt like everything that I
[47:31] had given out in in that meeting that
[47:34] the Lord returned back to me but I'd
[47:35] like to speak to you on a thought today
[47:39] sincerity the power over death sincerity
[47:43] the power over death and brother
[47:45] brandham said in the message influence
[47:47] he said now we're at the time of the
[47:49] Rapture he said it's going to happen
[47:51] because it's been perfect every other
[47:53] time it's going to be perfect this time
[47:56] God is calling out a people see it's the
[48:00] time we got to be sincere and notice
[48:03] what brother brother puit spoke to us
[48:05] last week in the hour has come so it's
[48:07] time so we we recognize we're at the
[48:10] time of rapture but notice what the
[48:13] prophet says we've got to be sincere
[48:16] again he would say over in the Christ
[48:18] the mystery of God revealed he said then
[48:21] if he is that then he should be the
[48:23] Principal theme of our talking of our
[48:26] thinking of our singing of our walks he
[48:29] should be the Principal theme of our
[48:31] life if he's the principal theme of The
[48:33] Bible and the Bible is in us then he
[48:36] should be the Principal theme of
[48:37] everything that we do say or think
[48:40] should be Christ is that right he should
[48:43] be the Principal theme of all of our
[48:46] life if he's the principal theme of The
[48:47] Bible he should be the Principal theme
[48:49] of all of our actions and I believe that
[48:52] it matters how that you approach God I
[48:55] believe that Everything Changes on how
[48:57] that you approach God you remember that
[48:59] when they were standing there and they
[49:01] they they had Jesus and they would put
[49:03] him put upon him the the crown of thorns
[49:06] and they would hit him in the face and
[49:07] they didn't get anything out of him
[49:09] because they didn't approach him in the
[49:11] right way but you remember that lady
[49:13] that had that blood issue how that she
[49:15] approached him that she went through the
[49:17] crowd and didn't care what anybody else
[49:19] said but when she reached out and
[49:21] touched him because she was the
[49:22] principal theme of all of her life of
[49:24] everything that she had heard about him
[49:27] he was getting to getting ready to
[49:29] release under her I believe that she she
[49:31] went in there with a real sincere heart
[49:34] because she understood what the Bible
[49:36] said that she shouldn't be around
[49:37] Humanity that she shouldn't be around
[49:39] other people in that day in those days
[49:41] of of her condition that she was in but
[49:44] she approached him in the right Manner
[49:46] and I believe that if we're going to get
[49:48] anything from God that we've got to
[49:50] approach him in the right manner of
[49:52] everything of life it's it's like it's
[49:54] like this brother brandham said right
[49:56] out here in Harrisonburg he said he said
[49:58] it's like you raising your hand you'll
[50:00] think well do you really get anything
[50:01] out of that brother brandham he said oh
[50:03] absolutely you do he said it changes
[50:06] from life to death if you really mean it
[50:08] so if you recognize that you have need
[50:11] of a savior and you just slip up your
[50:13] hand it changes things from Death unto
[50:17] life it matters how that you approach
[50:19] almighty God now that word sincerity it
[50:22] means honesty of mind or in attention
[50:26] that word it actually means that you are
[50:28] free from hypocrisy or you're free from
[50:30] disguise or you're free from false
[50:33] pretense as dis as as sincerity is a
[50:37] declaration of love it's like you you
[50:39] might say one thing with your words but
[50:42] your actions will prove differently
[50:44] because of your sincerity you you see
[50:46] there are many of men that are married
[50:48] to a to a woman but that that man may
[50:51] say unto her that I love you but his
[50:53] actions prove completely different
[50:56] he might say it with his actions or he
[50:57] might say it with his words but his
[50:59] actions might prove completely separate
[51:02] of the words that are coming out of his
[51:03] mouth so we don't want to be just people
[51:06] of confessors but we want to be
[51:08] possessors of the promises of God that
[51:10] we want to come boldly before him and we
[51:13] want to come before him with the right
[51:14] words just like Hattie did but we want
[51:17] to have the right heart as well we don't
[51:19] want to just simply come here out of
[51:21] tradition and just offer up a hand clap
[51:23] or offer up praise and all of those
[51:25] things just because of tradition but we
[51:27] want to come here under the power of an
[51:30] honest mind of an honest intention that
[51:33] Lord I need more of you Lord I I want
[51:36] more of you Lord I need healing and I
[51:38] Lord I need these things and I believe
[51:40] that how you approach him would change
[51:42] the situations of all of your lives no
[51:45] matter how old you are no matter how
[51:46] young you are I believe that if you
[51:48] approach him with a sincere heart that
[51:51] you will get the releas of your desire
[51:53] from the mind of God now brother mam
[51:55] said I don't believe that you can get
[51:57] too sincere about the work of God he
[51:59] said that's right the more sincere you
[52:01] are the better God can lead you ain't
[52:05] that wonderful the more sincere you are
[52:07] the better that God can lead you you see
[52:10] sincerity it it is a force that goes
[52:13] beyond words it reaches into our
[52:16] innermost being and shows all of our
[52:18] intentions and it shows all of our
[52:20] actions just like light as a genuine
[52:23] light begins to pierce through the
[52:24] darkness sincerity illuminates the paths
[52:28] of all of our beliefs it is not merely
[52:30] just saying the right words but it's
[52:32] aligning our soul with the word of God
[52:35] you notice that when brother brandham is
[52:36] there and he's getting ready to receive
[52:38] his commission by the angel of the Lord
[52:41] that there the angel meets him in that
[52:43] room he he would call it his special
[52:45] room or his his special spot and there
[52:47] the angel comes and meets him he meets
[52:50] him there and you notice what he begins
[52:52] to talk to him and he gives him his
[52:54] commission but but notice what he tells
[52:56] him he said if you'll be sincere and get
[52:59] the people to believe you that nothing
[53:01] will be able to stand before your prayer
[53:04] and brother brandham asked the question
[53:06] he said what about cancer and the angel
[53:08] said not even cancer so notice what this
[53:11] commission is hanging on or hinging on
[53:13] it is hinging upon sincerity and
[53:16] believing and I believe that nothing has
[53:19] change with almighty God I believe that
[53:21] if it was meant for William brandom and
[53:23] he is our messenger and we are under
[53:26] this message that I believe that if we
[53:28] can be sincere and if I believe that if
[53:30] we can really believe that nothing shall
[53:33] be able to stand before our prayer not
[53:35] even cancer you notice how that how that
[53:38] the Angels spoke those words and you'll
[53:40] notice that I was just I sent it to our
[53:42] family just yesterday about how that
[53:45] brother randam as soon as he got his
[53:46] commission one of the most major cases
[53:49] that's described throughout all the
[53:51] message is Sister Margie Morgan you can
[53:53] go back and study out through the
[53:54] message I don't I don't want to I don't
[53:55] want to go through the all the details
[53:57] but she had cancer all throughout her
[53:59] body intestines and it was wrapped up in
[54:01] there and when brother brandom prayed
[54:03] for her and he said those words over her
[54:06] you're not going to die but you're going
[54:07] to live brother brandham said that he's
[54:09] he not I want you to catch this that
[54:11] brother Morgan looked up there because
[54:13] he was friends with those doctors he
[54:15] knew the sincere or he knew the
[54:17] seriousness of this condition he said
[54:19] but if I can get you to believe me if I
[54:22] can get you to believe me because he
[54:24] said I believe with all of my heart he
[54:26] said I believe it with all of my heart
[54:28] he said but if I can get you to believe
[54:30] that with all of your heart is that
[54:32] right he said so I want you to notice
[54:34] that there he was speaking face to face
[54:36] with this supernatural being and he said
[54:39] if I can get you to believe me with all
[54:41] your heart you see it's very powerful
[54:43] this morning if I can get you to believe
[54:45] me with all your heart then you can go
[54:48] to believing God and that's what brother
[54:50] Brandon would tell us he said that's
[54:52] what moves God is your faith in him he
[54:56] said then you're healed your faith has
[54:58] saved you you see your faith that you
[55:00] had to believe has saved you but you
[55:03] because you because just because you say
[55:06] the right words it will never manifest
[55:08] unless you mix it with
[55:10] sincerity come on somebody we've had a
[55:13] whole lot of emotions we've had a whole
[55:15] lot of Pentecostal movements around the
[55:17] message but we don't want to just mix up
[55:19] our words with just emotions we want our
[55:23] words to be mixed with with truth we
[55:26] want our words and our action and our
[55:28] dance and our speech and our and our
[55:30] gifts we want it to be mixed with
[55:32] sincerity I don't want something that's
[55:35] just on the flesh or in the carnal
[55:36] Realms that can leave us at any moment
[55:39] but if we can mix it with sincerity if
[55:42] we can mix it with truth come on
[55:45] somebody if you know what you's dancing
[55:46] about then nobody can take it away from
[55:49] you if you know what you're amening
[55:51] about there's no devil that can rob it
[55:53] from you if you know why you got got
[55:55] your joy back and it's mixed with
[55:57] sincerity and it's mixed with truth let
[55:59] the devil come let him try to rob from
[56:03] you nothing ain't nothing change with
[56:06] God if you approach him in the same way
[56:08] as William brandom approached him in
[56:10] every prayer line sincerity and in truth
[56:14] I believe that you can get the same
[56:16] response I believe that you can get the
[56:18] same works I believe that you can get
[56:20] the same
[56:21] manifestations brother Brandon was asked
[56:23] the question one time he said well does
[56:25] everybody get well he said everybody
[56:27] that
[56:28] believes everybody that believes gets
[56:31] well now there's hundreds that got sick
[56:33] again after they got prayed for but look
[56:35] at all of those that did
[56:38] believe but I believe that this message
[56:40] came more than just to give us a first
[56:43] pull and a second pull I believe that
[56:45] this message came more than just for
[56:47] Divine
[56:49] Healing I don't think I'm way out of
[56:51] here I know that we need Divine Healing
[56:53] like never before in this place
[56:55] but I believe that this message came
[56:57] more for us than just to receive Divine
[56:59] Healing I believe he's came to give us
[57:01] Divine Health where we never get sick no
[57:04] more where we don't have to worry about
[57:06] the about the chaos of life I believe
[57:08] that God's got something out there in
[57:10] front of us and I believe that this
[57:12] message is that that gives us power over
[57:16] death come on somebody what good is this
[57:19] message doing if it ain't giving us
[57:21] power over death come on somebody it was
[57:23] more than just for a Elijah's Ministry
[57:26] it's for you come on Elisha wrap
[57:29] yourself up in this robe of the message
[57:32] of the hour we don't want just Divine
[57:34] Healing we don't want just gifts of the
[57:36] Spirit we want a body
[57:40] change
[57:42] hallelujah
[57:44] hallelujah now the Bible says in
[57:46] Proverbs 11:3 that the Integrity of the
[57:49] upright shall guide them or the
[57:51] sincerity of the upright shall guide
[57:54] them but the perverseness of
[57:56] transgressors shall destroy them notice
[58:00] anybody can be sincere brother random
[58:02] said if if all God requires is sincerity
[58:05] then Cain had it if all God requires is
[58:08] a sacrifice then Cain had it so let me
[58:11] make myself very clear today before we
[58:13] go too much further sincerity does not
[58:16] save
[58:17] you Works sincerity where it works is is
[58:21] not of is not of sincerity sincerity is
[58:24] not works but it's by Grace is that
[58:27] right so let me make this very very very
[58:30] clear to you you can be as sincere as
[58:32] all get out but it does not save you
[58:36] look at Paul on the road to Damascus he
[58:38] was sincere as anybody else in the land
[58:41] he was following the message of Moses to
[58:44] the letter and he did it gladly and he
[58:47] had sincerity in his heart but when he
[58:50] met that angel when he met that Pillar
[58:51] of Fire what happened it changed him him
[58:55] to the truth so what did it do he had
[58:58] sincerity but he didn't have truth you
[59:01] can have sincerity and not have truth
[59:04] and miss the whole picture what was Paul
[59:07] doing he was up there in sincerity and
[59:09] he was killing out the children of God
[59:12] brother random said the most sincere
[59:14] people that I know of in all the land is
[59:24] they give themselves up to sacrifices he
[59:27] said they're sincere in doing it he said
[59:29] a man can sincerely take medicine from a
[59:31] from a from a doctor but he said that
[59:34] doctor or that pharmacist could get it
[59:35] wrong he could be doing it sincere and
[59:38] get it completely wrong and mix death
[59:40] into his body but notice that God does
[59:43] not judge you by your sincerity God
[59:46] judges you God judges you by the grace
[59:50] of God he judges you by the word that he
[59:54] deposit it on the inside of your heart
[59:56] so sincerity does not save
[1:00:00] you what are you saying to us brother
[1:00:02] Andrew I'd say that we're living in a
[1:00:04] very special hour I believe that we're
[1:00:07] living under the greatest message that
[1:00:09] there ever has been I believe that what
[1:00:11] has been released to us as the body of
[1:00:14] Jesus Christ that we ought to we ought
[1:00:16] to hold oursel up to another standard of
[1:00:19] the message I don't believe that we need
[1:00:21] to knck oursel down and lower oursel
[1:00:23] down just to try to match some kind of a
[1:00:26] denominational idea but I believe that
[1:00:28] if we're going to do something in this
[1:00:30] life as message Believers then we got to
[1:00:33] be
[1:00:38] sincere now notice what the Bible tells
[1:00:41] us in second Timothy and I'm not going
[1:00:43] to read the whole scriptures but you
[1:00:45] notice that when when when uh Paul is
[1:00:48] writing out this letter to Timothy here
[1:00:51] in 2 Timothy and three that Paul lays
[1:00:54] out the the attitude of Le oosa that in
[1:00:58] the last days there will be hey
[1:01:00] high-minded lovers of Pleasures more
[1:01:02] than lovers of God what was it they had
[1:01:05] got away from sincerity and they'd gots
[1:01:08] away from the faith of the true Faith
[1:01:11] that's why when in the book of Jude it
[1:01:13] tells us that we ought to earnestly
[1:01:15] contend for the faith the faith not a
[1:01:18] not a faith but the faith the same faith
[1:01:21] that Paul had notice what brother random
[1:01:23] said in the message all things he said
[1:01:25] God hates a powerless religion and any
[1:01:29] religion today that hasn't got Christ in
[1:01:31] it is powerless but any religion that
[1:01:33] has Christ in it is under his own blood
[1:01:36] it's got power in it you say well God
[1:01:38] hates a religion without power he said
[1:01:40] your solemn Feast is a stink I guess he
[1:01:43] does hate it he said it makes me sick
[1:01:46] and remember he told this rich leodys
[1:01:49] and church that because you're lukewarm
[1:01:52] you in other words you make me sick I'll
[1:01:53] spew you out out of my mouth and we've
[1:01:55] come to that
[1:01:57] age how many more churches can we build
[1:02:01] how many more denominations can be out
[1:02:03] there but that is not what God is
[1:02:05] looking for of more
[1:02:07] buildings come on somebody we got more
[1:02:09] Bibles and we ever had before we got
[1:02:12] more church members that are going there
[1:02:14] for popcorn and ice cream and coffee
[1:02:16] than there ever has before but they're
[1:02:18] not there for
[1:02:20] truth they're there for
[1:02:23] activities but what are you here
[1:02:28] for come on somebody I wouldn't give you
[1:02:31] a nickel for somebody that just showed
[1:02:33] up here sincerely just to say that they
[1:02:35] came to church for another weekend but I
[1:02:38] wouldn't take a million dollars for
[1:02:40] somebody that shows up in the house of
[1:02:42] God that mixes their sincerity with the
[1:02:44] power of this message but let me tell
[1:02:46] you something you can have your
[1:02:48] sincerity all you want to but give me
[1:02:50] the message of the hour put it on the
[1:02:53] vessel of somebody that's living out the
[1:02:56] message ain't no devil in hell knows
[1:02:59] what to do with a young girl that's so
[1:03:01] completely sold out to herself that she
[1:03:03] don't even think her own thoughts no
[1:03:05] more that little boy don't think his own
[1:03:07] thoughts no more but he's so embodied by
[1:03:09] the power of the Holy Ghost that the
[1:03:12] devil doesn't know what to do with
[1:03:15] him God hates a
[1:03:19] powerless
[1:03:22] religion he said God send us an is
[1:03:25] Isaiah to chop the thing to Pieces he
[1:03:28] said lay it out before the people spare
[1:03:30] not he said you think he'd be accept it
[1:03:32] certainly not but he cried just the same
[1:03:35] your solemn Feast there a stink he said
[1:03:38] notice he said God hates a powerless
[1:03:40] religion he said it's got to have power
[1:03:42] in
[1:03:44] it it's got to have power in it it's got
[1:03:48] to have sincerity
[1:03:51] sincerity brings power
[1:03:57] sincerity brings real worship not forms
[1:04:01] but genuine power worship to know that
[1:04:04] you've passed from Death un life he said
[1:04:07] God wants to perform his word by his
[1:04:09] power and when the church denies his
[1:04:11] power how can he perform and vindicate
[1:04:13] his word when the church explains it
[1:04:15] away and says it's for some other day
[1:04:18] and something how can God who wants to
[1:04:20] fulfill his word and perform his word
[1:04:22] among the people and the people deny
[1:04:25] that he does it yet they go through all
[1:04:27] of the rituals so we don't want a ritual
[1:04:31] we want
[1:04:33] power is that right we want anointing is
[1:04:35] that right what is anointing it's the
[1:04:38] supreme power under
[1:04:41] control it ain't flying off loose of the
[1:04:43] cannon speaking things into existence
[1:04:45] that never will come into existence but
[1:04:48] the anointing it's supreme power under
[1:04:51] control was that brother Andrew why
[1:04:53] don't you start speaking squirrels into
[1:04:55] existence if you got that kind of power
[1:04:57] I'm not in need of
[1:05:00] squirrels but I am in need of my dad's
[1:05:03] healing I am in need of my brother
[1:05:06] receiving his prodal back home I am in
[1:05:08] need of a body
[1:05:10] change come on now let the anointing
[1:05:15] that's been released in this generation
[1:05:17] by the opening of the seals of this day
[1:05:19] release an anointing through your
[1:05:23] life
[1:05:24] come on somebody you're not in need of
[1:05:26] squirrels you're not in need of giving
[1:05:28] back a little posum his life back again
[1:05:30] you're not in need of giving a little
[1:05:31] fish back his life again but you are
[1:05:34] needing that real Sanctified holy life
[1:05:37] that the devil doesn't know what to do
[1:05:39] with you you do need that overcoming
[1:05:42] life what do we got to do brother Angel
[1:05:45] then we got to have blood on our
[1:05:53] heart
[1:05:55] we don't want just
[1:05:56] sincerity is that right I'm going
[1:05:59] somewhere we don't want just sincerity
[1:06:02] because look at the chief priests and
[1:06:03] the elders they were more sincere than
[1:06:06] probably some of you
[1:06:07] here they were sincere about the law
[1:06:10] they were sincere about carrying out
[1:06:12] Moses's message but when Jesus the one
[1:06:16] that could fulfill all the
[1:06:18] law was standing before them in Matthew
[1:06:22] chapter 27 you go to read it out it's
[1:06:23] very
[1:06:25] powerful when they've got a choice
[1:06:28] between power or death notice what
[1:06:32] happen they come to a certain season
[1:06:34] when the Bible said that there's a
[1:06:35] season when they would let out a a a a
[1:06:38] notable prisoner in that age but notice
[1:06:42] how close Satan gets he makes it look
[1:06:45] like going to church is the right thing
[1:06:46] he makes it look like he makes it look
[1:06:48] like doing all these rituals is the
[1:06:49] right thing is that close in Matthew 24
[1:06:52] and 24 that it would deceive the elect
[1:06:54] if it was possible notice how close he
[1:06:57] gets here's pilot standing in the middle
[1:07:01] here's barabus on this side known as a
[1:07:04] murderer this murder had been
[1:07:07] around since Mary was riding over the
[1:07:10] hills on a
[1:07:13] donkey and here's Jesus on this
[1:07:17] side can I put it to
[1:07:20] you in Hebrew and
[1:07:22] Greek
[1:07:25] will you choose Jesus or will you choose
[1:07:30] Jesus because if you look up Jesus and
[1:07:33] you look up barabus their name aligns
[1:07:36] together the son of the
[1:07:40] father see how close he is see how close
[1:07:43] he comes in front of you and said if
[1:07:45] you'll just accept accept a little
[1:07:47] handshake now you're too smart for that
[1:07:50] but if you'll just accept a little
[1:07:51] emotion or if you'll accept this you
[1:07:53] just just shout your way into the Holy
[1:07:55] Ghost if you accept that Jesus or
[1:07:59] Jesus it could be very confusing for
[1:08:02] somebody that does not have the Holy
[1:08:04] Spirit are you preaching me the message
[1:08:06] or are you preaching me the message am I
[1:08:09] choosing Jesus or am I choosing
[1:08:12] Jesus so let me put it to you like this
[1:08:15] do you want a murder or do you do you
[1:08:17] want a LIF taker or do you want a
[1:08:20] lifegiver do you want somebody that's
[1:08:24] known as bringing healing to the body do
[1:08:26] you want somebody that's known for
[1:08:28] bringing manifestations back to the
[1:08:30] Church of the Living God or do you want
[1:08:32] somebody at the end of the day that all
[1:08:35] they can offer you is
[1:08:38] death now look I look at this picture
[1:08:41] look at this drama they're said here
[1:08:43] before
[1:08:45] today these guys in the middle they got
[1:08:48] you all Here In This Crowd this
[1:08:50] multitude is
[1:08:52] gathered and you came here with one
[1:08:55] thought you came here with one thought
[1:08:58] in this
[1:08:59] building let me take you back 200000
[1:09:01] years you come in this
[1:09:03] arena with one
[1:09:06] purpose there's a choice before you but
[1:09:08] brother random said they made a Ras
[1:09:09] mistake when they chose a lifetaker
[1:09:12] instead of a lifegiver let me say this
[1:09:14] to you anytime you choose cigarettes you
[1:09:16] made the wrong choice every time you
[1:09:19] choose to worship worship Satan instead
[1:09:21] of God you made the wrong choice every
[1:09:23] time you try to you look down through
[1:09:25] the things of of Life of maybe just
[1:09:27] giving you a little bit more pleasure
[1:09:29] you chose the wrong thing these people
[1:09:33] had such an effect they had such a
[1:09:37] Ministry don't tell me Joe o ain't got
[1:09:39] some power don't tell me don't tell me
[1:09:41] that man that fell down there in
[1:09:43] Louisiana that that that that was there
[1:09:45] that was really close that that that
[1:09:47] Jimmy swaggered he was really close to
[1:09:49] it and he fell in sin and he told the
[1:09:52] whole world that he fell in sin don't
[1:09:54] tell me he ain't got power he influences
[1:09:56] the
[1:09:58] crowds and they think they're worshiping
[1:10:02] Jesus think I'm wrong go listen to God
[1:10:05] of this evil AG think I'm wrong they
[1:10:07] were that close they were choosing
[1:10:09] barabus or Jesus look how close it was
[1:10:13] they was that close and this
[1:10:15] crowd of Chief
[1:10:18] priest the Bible said that they
[1:10:20] persuaded
[1:10:22] them they pers persuaded them to choose
[1:10:25] a
[1:10:29] lifetaker I'm going somewhere today and
[1:10:32] I can feel all all the brickles of hell
[1:10:34] trying to upset some things here but I
[1:10:37] want to show you something these men
[1:10:39] were sincere but they were sincerely
[1:10:41] wrong you can have truth but without
[1:10:43] sincerity you cannot make the word of
[1:10:46] God live for the day is that right you
[1:10:48] can have the message you can have it in
[1:10:50] your room you can have the pictures on
[1:10:52] your wall but without
[1:10:56] sincerity brother brandom said that when
[1:10:59] he was there in the Houston debate I
[1:11:01] read this yesterday about about blew me
[1:11:03] away but he said he said when I he said
[1:11:05] when I was there in the Houston debate
[1:11:07] he said I really thought that Dr best
[1:11:09] was sincere he said I really did think
[1:11:11] he was
[1:11:12] sincere he said I really did think he
[1:11:14] was sincere he said until he looked out
[1:11:16] there and said I feel sorry for those
[1:11:18] people that out there in those
[1:11:19] Wheelchairs and those Cs and dying with
[1:11:21] Cancers he said he couldn't have
[1:11:23] sincerity when he was trying to rob them
[1:11:25] children of the only hope that they ever
[1:11:27] had he said he was trying to rob them he
[1:11:30] was he said it was they were like a
[1:11:31] robin a starving man of a meal he said
[1:11:34] how can you been sincere taking away the
[1:11:37] only hope that we got let me tell you
[1:11:39] something you can take this whole world
[1:11:42] but give me this message you can take my
[1:11:44] house you can take my money you can take
[1:11:47] my job you can take my family but give
[1:11:50] me this
[1:11:52] message come on somebody what are you
[1:11:55] without this
[1:12:00] message what are you without it they
[1:12:03] were so close to it but they failed to
[1:12:06] recognize the power of the message that
[1:12:09] was standing before
[1:12:11] them well brother
[1:12:13] Andrew you're preaching to us sincerity
[1:12:16] how about you let me throw myself in
[1:12:20] here ministers should be the utmost
[1:12:25] example of
[1:12:30] sincerity let me tell you y'all get to
[1:12:33] hide your yourself I get to live in a
[1:12:35] glass glass house and everybody sees
[1:12:38] everything you will judge everything
[1:12:40] that I do by them girls right
[1:12:43] there if I preach to you a message of
[1:12:45] Holiness and they don't live up to it
[1:12:47] who's going to be the first one to call
[1:12:49] me
[1:12:49] out come on
[1:12:52] somebody if I preach to you a message
[1:12:55] that we ought to live this message with
[1:12:57] everything of power and sincerity of
[1:12:59] spending hours reading our Bible
[1:13:01] listening to the message and my
[1:13:03] daughters never listened to it what good
[1:13:05] is my
[1:13:07] preaching it's just words but if my
[1:13:11] daughters get filled with the same holy
[1:13:14] ghost that I got filled with then it's a
[1:13:16] sign to all of hell that the message
[1:13:19] still works and I got news and I'm
[1:13:21] putting the devil on notice today
[1:13:23] the message still
[1:13:26] works I got little girls that got the
[1:13:29] same holy ghost that I
[1:13:31] got
[1:13:35] Hallelujah come on somebody if this
[1:13:38] message can't produce the same works
[1:13:40] that William Brandon produced in the
[1:13:42] 1960s what are we doing
[1:13:46] here I'm putting it down to you today
[1:13:49] what are we preaching what are we living
[1:13:51] what are we asking for where are we we
[1:13:56] at if God spoke a word over Zoe little
[1:13:59] Zoe back there and said that she was
[1:14:01] going to speak and she never spoke her
[1:14:03] entire life then you would say
[1:14:05] something's wrong with the ministry
[1:14:10] here come on somebody what if the Lord
[1:14:13] had a vision of a little Isaac and there
[1:14:15] never came
[1:14:19] one come on somebody either we're
[1:14:22] testifying the truth or we're defy to a
[1:14:26] lie but I recognize there's a power
[1:14:28] behind this
[1:14:29] word that I'm not the one or brother
[1:14:32] Ron's not the one or brother Tim's not
[1:14:33] the one or all of these other
[1:14:36] brothers we are held to an example of
[1:14:40] sincerity so I better be right when I
[1:14:43] walk out that back door I better not
[1:14:45] have anything carnal on my mind I better
[1:14:47] not have anything out there that would
[1:14:49] disrupt me from you getting your
[1:14:52] blessing
[1:14:55] and I love you more than I love
[1:14:58] myself I'm responsible for 200 people to
[1:15:02] preach to them the
[1:15:04] message Paul said in Titus 2: 7 it says
[1:15:08] in all things showing thyself a pattern
[1:15:10] of Good Works in Doctrine showing
[1:15:12] uncorrupt this gravity and sincerity
[1:15:15] ministers it should be sound speech that
[1:15:18] cannot be
[1:15:19] condemned that he that is of the
[1:15:21] contrary part may be
[1:15:24] ashamed having no evil thing to say of
[1:15:26] you so he that's on the other side
[1:15:30] ministers ought to be able to live such
[1:15:32] a life that those that are on the other
[1:15:34] side of Truth would not be able to have
[1:15:36] anything said of
[1:15:41] you how you going to live that out
[1:15:43] brother
[1:15:44] Andrew it ain't me living is him notice
[1:15:49] 2 Corinthians 2:17 for we are not as
[1:15:52] many which corrupt the world word of God
[1:15:54] but as of sincerity but as of God in the
[1:15:59] sight of God speak we in Christ so we
[1:16:02] cannot as Paul said in the Hebrew letter
[1:16:05] how are we going to escape these things
[1:16:07] if we neglect so great a Salvation now
[1:16:10] notice what brother brand said he said
[1:16:11] how are we going to escape it he said
[1:16:13] you neglect to eat you're going to die
[1:16:15] he said you neglect to turn the corner
[1:16:17] you'll wreck you neglect the milk of the
[1:16:19] cow she'll go dry you neglect your teeth
[1:16:22] you'll have to have the all pulled out
[1:16:23] certainly he said you'll pay for your
[1:16:27] negation say it to me neglection all
[1:16:30] brandom Tabernacle oh you visitors let
[1:16:33] me tell you something you neglect to
[1:16:36] testify of the glory of God you neglect
[1:16:38] to give God the praise and glory and
[1:16:40] you'll find yourself cold formal and
[1:16:45] backsliding you give God
[1:16:52] praise how are we going to escape these
[1:16:55] things if we neglect to give it notice
[1:16:57] what Peter said in 1 Peter 2 and 21 for
[1:17:00] he even here unto were you called
[1:17:03] because Christ also suffered for us
[1:17:05] leaving us an example that you should
[1:17:07] follow his steps who did no sin neither
[1:17:11] was guile found in his mouth no deceit
[1:17:16] no subtility no craftiness in his words
[1:17:19] it was simply truth in his
[1:17:22] mouth he left us an
[1:17:25] example again 2 Corinthians 1:12 for our
[1:17:30] rejoicing is this the testimony of our
[1:17:32] conscience that in Simplicity and godly
[1:17:36] sincerity so all of our whole conduct
[1:17:40] everything that our heart
[1:17:42] engages should be that in Simplicity and
[1:17:45] godly sincerity not with f fleshly
[1:17:47] wisdom but by the grace of God we have
[1:17:50] had our conversation in the world and
[1:17:53] more abundantly to you word so
[1:17:55] everything about us should be done in s
[1:18:00] sincerity thank you brother Andrew
[1:18:03] you're getting right there on my level
[1:18:05] thank you I'm glad you like
[1:18:09] that let's conduct
[1:18:11] ourselves as Sons and Daughters of
[1:18:14] God in everything that we
[1:18:17] do what did I ask you last weekend
[1:18:20] consecrate yourself like never before
[1:18:24] is that right if we're going to see
[1:18:26] Miracles then we got to consecrate
[1:18:27] oursel like never before we ought to
[1:18:29] conduct ourselves as Sons and Daughters
[1:18:31] of God a daughter of God don't go out
[1:18:33] there and live in beer joints and paint
[1:18:35] her face up and cut her hair off and act
[1:18:36] like a prostitute conduct yourself as a
[1:18:39] daughter of God you're a daughter of the
[1:18:41] king sons of God don't you go out there
[1:18:44] and take the Bible and say oh days of
[1:18:46] Miracles has pass all that kind of that
[1:18:48] all that kind of stuff he said you stand
[1:18:50] up for everything that God said
[1:18:54] that's how you ought to conduct yourself
[1:18:56] is aligning everything with the word of
[1:18:59] God because we're Sons and Daughters of
[1:19:02] the
[1:19:04] king notice
[1:19:08] when notice when Joshua is coming out to
[1:19:12] the closing hours of his ministry and
[1:19:15] Lord willing I'm going to be taking a a
[1:19:17] series on something that the Lord dealt
[1:19:19] with me this past past week on on
[1:19:22] providing The
[1:19:25] Inheritance but I want you to notice I
[1:19:27] want you to notice Joshua's last charge
[1:19:30] in Joshua chapter
[1:19:31] 24 most of you have most of you have it
[1:19:34] in your home that as for me in my house
[1:19:37] we'll serve the Lord but just before
[1:19:40] Joshua tells tells those things in
[1:19:43] Joshua 14 he says therefore fear the
[1:19:48] lord and serve him in sincerity and in
[1:19:52] truth and put away the gods which your
[1:19:55] father served on the other side of the
[1:19:56] flood and in Egypt serve ye the Lord if
[1:20:00] you go to looking up that word in the
[1:20:02] Hebrew tamim of sincerity it it means it
[1:20:05] is what is complete or it's entirely in
[1:20:09] accord with truth so in other words we
[1:20:12] ought to serve him by being in line with
[1:20:16] the word of God now you're going to come
[1:20:18] against you're going to come against
[1:20:19] Crossroads you're going to come up
[1:20:21] against things in life but stay in line
[1:20:24] what did the prophet say what was the
[1:20:26] message that came at the preview of the
[1:20:28] Bride stay in line little bride stay in
[1:20:31] line little bride what voice got you
[1:20:34] back in line it was this Prophet
[1:20:36] messenger that gave a voice in this
[1:20:38] generation what was it when Moses was
[1:20:41] out there and he was back there on the
[1:20:43] backs side of that desert and the word
[1:20:46] of the Lord came unto
[1:20:48] him and said you're going to come back
[1:20:50] here and you're going to worship me upon
[1:20:52] on this mountain Moses had some
[1:20:55] obstacles that he had to go through he
[1:20:57] had some hurdles that he had to jump
[1:21:01] through you might be sincere and you
[1:21:04] might be a real Christian but you're
[1:21:07] still going to get bombarded by Satan
[1:21:09] you're going to still get bombarded
[1:21:11] you're still going to have cancer maybe
[1:21:12] hit you you're still going to have
[1:21:14] troubles that hit you maybe you go to a
[1:21:16] doctor and the doctor says you're going
[1:21:17] to die or different things like that it
[1:21:19] doesn't change your
[1:21:21] salvation
[1:21:23] Moses had a little bitty pharaohs and a
[1:21:25] little bitty Egyptian armies that were
[1:21:27] going after him they didn't change his
[1:21:29] mind about what God said about him
[1:21:31] brother brandom said that he stayed
[1:21:32] right there all that time in the line of
[1:21:34] duty and I believe that if there's any
[1:21:37] ever anything that we need to do in this
[1:21:38] message we ought to get right back in
[1:21:40] line with
[1:21:44] it are you with me are you with me you
[1:21:48] ought to get so sincere you ought to get
[1:21:50] so sincere about about about your prayer
[1:21:53] life you ought to get so sincere about
[1:21:55] your about your walk with God you ought
[1:21:58] to get so sincere about your devotions
[1:22:00] you ought to get so sincere about your
[1:22:02] prayer life how that how that you can
[1:22:04] set an atmosphere right there in your
[1:22:08] home so that you set an atmosphere and
[1:22:11] the presence of God would drop down in
[1:22:13] your home because you had some sincerity
[1:22:16] about
[1:22:17] you brother Brandon would talk about
[1:22:19] that woman up there that widow's airpath
[1:22:21] how that she got so sincere how that she
[1:22:24] was coming down through her last meal
[1:22:26] and she was right there in a time of
[1:22:28] famine she was coming down there when
[1:22:30] death was getting ready to strike at her
[1:22:32] door getting ready to strike at her door
[1:22:35] but brother bham said that she broke
[1:22:37] into another realm and she went in there
[1:22:39] and her her prayers were me with so much
[1:22:41] more sincerity in her prayer
[1:22:47] life notice what she did she aligned
[1:22:51] herself with the word here's this Widow
[1:22:54] she's in a time of famine ain't nobody
[1:22:56] eating but this little widow she don't
[1:22:59] know what blessings coming on her heart
[1:23:01] because she's or what's getting ready to
[1:23:03] come by her way is because she stayed in
[1:23:05] prayer it's because she stayed up there
[1:23:07] when nobody else was worshiping she
[1:23:09] stayed up there in prayer when nobody
[1:23:11] else was in Feast she was getting ready
[1:23:13] to come into a feast he said well
[1:23:15] brother Andrew I ain't seen no blessings

[1:23:26] right there whether you see it coming or
[1:23:28] whether you don't stay right there stay

[1:23:47] prophet that had been fed by crows had
[1:23:50] been fed by those Ravens all those days
[1:23:53] but the spirit of the Lord come whirling
[1:23:54] over top of him and said get down there
[1:23:56] to S path I got a woman down there
[1:23:59] that's going to feed you don't you

[1:24:17] oil and she's going to fix it for her
[1:24:19] son and they're going to
[1:24:21] die but when she come to a prophet
[1:24:24] messenger when she got hooked up with
[1:24:26] Elijah come on somebody she took
[1:24:28] Elijah's word she aligned herself with
[1:24:31] Elijah's word and it gave her power over
[1:24:35] death don't you see what this message is
[1:24:37] doing unto you the rest of the world
[1:24:40] Amos said is in a famine but you're not

[1:24:46] before you you got spiritual food in
[1:24:48] newe season that's been poured out to
[1:24:50] you and because you aligned yourself s
[1:24:52] with Elijah's
[1:24:54] message because you aligned yourself

[1:25:14] her prayer life was in line and when the
[1:25:16] message came by her way everything was
[1:25:19] in line it did not bring her death
[1:25:22] brought her life what do the
[1:25:24] denominations offer you Eternal
[1:25:26] separation they offer you death but what
[1:25:29] did this message offer to
[1:25:33] you
[1:25:35] life come on somebody that old devil
[1:25:39] that on sloot he's come to steal to kill

[1:26:20] so sincere that it'll confuse

[1:26:33] ladies was going up there to shoh just
[1:26:36] to take a look at the cinal Realms and
[1:26:37] see what kind of hats and what kind of
[1:26:40] dresses that the rest of the world was
[1:26:41] looking at Hannah went up there with
[1:26:43] sincerity and brother brandham said that
[1:26:45] her sincerity brought a misunderstanding
[1:26:47] to that priest and he didn't understand
[1:26:50] he thought she was drunk

[1:26:58] that it'll be
[1:27:00] misunderstood well I need quotes for it

[1:30:50] being sold in there
[1:30:52] what happens in a place like this when
[1:30:54] you begin to mix your sincerity with the
[1:30:57] stimulation by Revelation the atmosphere
[1:30:59] begins to change and in that atmosphere
[1:31:02] I'm going to quote you the message
[1:31:03] because that's the only thing I know is

[1:31:48] token come on somebody the message got a
[1:31:51] hold of me when I thought I was unworthy

[1:32:20] store
[1:32:23] Hallelujah let me tell you that's the
[1:32:25] only thing that's the only thing when
[1:32:27] Joshua was standing there he standing
[1:32:29] there in Joshua 24 what is he doing he's
[1:32:32] encouraging the
[1:32:34] people you stay right here put away them
[1:32:39] Gods you ever think about this where we
[1:32:41] are in Revelations chapter N9 where we
[1:32:43] see the smoke coming out of a bottomless
[1:32:45] pit we see leoy on every hand your young
[1:32:48] people are dealing with more
[1:32:49] homosexuality in your school than than
[1:32:51] any of us adults ever had to deal with
[1:32:54] what is it it's a confusion smoke is a
[1:32:57] confusion they don't know which way to
[1:32:59] go brother s they don't know whether to
[1:33:00] go to the light or the right or the left
[1:33:02] they don't know you young people are
[1:33:04] facing more
[1:33:10] demons but I want you to know something
[1:33:12] God's Got Confidence in the seed that he
[1:33:14] placed on the inside of you let me tell
[1:33:16] you something when you feel like you
[1:33:17] ain't sincere enough your jean seed of
[1:33:20] God makes you
[1:33:24] sincere what did he do he's telling them
[1:33:28] put away them things put away them
[1:33:30] carnal things they didn't do you no good
[1:33:31] down there in Egypt put away the gods
[1:33:33] that you
[1:33:35] know come on now put away them things
[1:33:38] but Joshua wasn't just taking them to a
[1:33:41] spot of justification or
[1:33:44] sanctification what are we under we're
[1:33:46] under a Joshua commission what was
[1:33:48] Joshua doing he was taking them to a
[1:33:51] spot where the the token had to be
[1:33:53] applied in their life what was it what
[1:33:56] was it Joshua was looking out there a
[1:33:58] real leader looks out there in the
[1:34:00] future and Joshua was looking out there
[1:34:02] and he saw a promise over there he saw a
[1:34:05] Promised Land over there he saw milk and
[1:34:07] honey over there and what was he telling
[1:34:10] them put away your Gods he ain't telling
[1:34:13] them just to sanctify yourself for the
[1:34:15] battle get yourself full of the Holy
[1:34:18] Ghost what was he doing he was aligning
[1:34:20] himself with the word of God God because
[1:34:22] he recognized that out there was an
[1:34:24] inheritance for them that it was rightly
[1:34:26] theirs they had every right to it they
[1:34:29] had every right to it I want you to know
[1:34:31] that you've got every right that had a
[1:34:32] right grabbed a hold of right here in
[1:34:34] this building if you align yourself with
[1:34:36] the
[1:34:38] word right if you serve him in sincerity
[1:34:41] and Truth God will back up his word just
[1:34:44] look at Enoch Enoch walked with God and
[1:34:47] the Bible said that he was not the Bible
[1:34:49] said that by Enoch by by faith Enoch was
[1:34:51] translated by faith he held this
[1:34:54] testimony that he pleased
[1:34:56] God Enoch
[1:34:59] name means
[1:35:04] dedicated he was dedicated when he was
[1:35:06] walking with God he was dedicated when
[1:35:09] his wife didn't want him to go he was
[1:35:11] dedicated when his children wasn't
[1:35:12] walking with him but the Bible tells us
[1:35:16] that Enoch prophesied of the Lord's
[1:35:18] coming so do you recognize
[1:35:22] that he was a type of you he was typing
[1:35:25] out a people that were built for the
[1:35:27] Rapture you're dedicated for the Rapture
[1:35:30] you're sincere about the Rapture you're
[1:35:32] consecrated for the Rapture and he was
[1:35:34] living an hour and it was much worse
[1:35:37] than this he was living in an hour he'd
[1:35:39] Liv 57 years with Adam on the earth he'd
[1:35:43] talked with Adam about going back to
[1:35:45] Eden he'd heard about it he'd been there
[1:35:48] with him he talked with him all of those
[1:35:50] things and Enoch just kept on walking he
[1:35:54] just kept on walking when nobody else
[1:35:56] would align thems with what Enoch was
[1:35:58] being talked to by
[1:36:00] Adam Hallelujah he was aligning himself
[1:36:04] because if I don't do this there's a
[1:36:06] people that's coming that won't have a
[1:36:08] type I'm the seventh from abam I'm the
[1:36:11] seventh from Adam I'm living in a world
[1:36:13] of Le osia with doomed people doomed for
[1:36:17] Destruction but I'm making a step I'm
[1:36:20] watching I'm walking constantly in
[1:36:22] fellowship with an Eden
[1:36:25] realm with doomed people young people
[1:36:28] you rub shoulders with people in your H
[1:36:30] in your classrooms that are doomed
[1:36:32] people but you're walking on because
[1:36:34] you're
[1:36:36] dedicated you got young people that'll
[1:36:38] surely go through the tribulation there
[1:36:41] but you're not dedicated for the
[1:36:42] tribulation you're dedicated for the
[1:36:45] Rapture come on somebody come on
[1:36:48] somebody he lives so perfect but before
[1:36:51] almighty God he lived so dedicated that
[1:36:55] God could not deny him the
[1:37:03] Rapture and my mama don't
[1:37:05] go it ain't going to hinder me if my
[1:37:09] daddy don't go it won't hinder me if the
[1:37:12] deacons don't go he won't hinder me I'm
[1:37:16] on my way praise God I'm on my way
[1:37:21] Enoch kept walking when his wife
[1:37:23] wouldn't walk with him he said I'm
[1:37:25] dedicated for this walk I'm dedicated
[1:37:28] for this message I'm dedicated for a
[1:37:30] translation I'm dedicated for it and
[1:37:33] what is it going to take little bride
[1:37:34] it's going to take a people that is
[1:37:36] dedicated like never
[1:37:41] before I notice when brother brand when
[1:37:44] he goes in there and he starts he tells
[1:37:47] us a vision and I
[1:37:49] always I believe you do this as well but
[1:37:51] a vision is the very mind of the lord
[1:37:54] it's the word of the Lord in Vision
[1:37:57] form and we know that we know there's
[1:38:00] over 8,000 Visions in the message but I
[1:38:04] want you to recognize this those Visions
[1:38:06] just wasn't for William Brown those are
[1:38:08] your
[1:38:09] Visions
[1:38:10] right I don't know about you but that's
[1:38:13] how I see
[1:38:14] myself that's how I see myself in the
[1:38:18] message you might think that's a little
[1:38:20] strange but let me tell you something
[1:38:22] who's the message for me it's for me so
[1:38:26] those visions that were held there that
[1:38:28] for were were William brandham he had
[1:38:30] the Visions he was simply a prophet
[1:38:32] messenger he held those Visions there
[1:38:35] but when William brandham comes and he
[1:38:37] depicts those things let me tell you the
[1:38:39] best thing that you can do when you're
[1:38:40] watching out a drama is to put yourself
[1:38:43] right there in that drama what would you
[1:38:45] do in this picture what would you do in
[1:38:47] this drama and brother bandam are
[1:38:49] telling us in 1961 in the Paradox about
[1:38:52] a about a a about death that it was
[1:38:55] coming that there he was and he sawed
[1:38:57] this Vision before the Lord he said he
[1:38:59] he said I was sitting there and I
[1:39:01] watched his vision before the Lord there
[1:39:03] that he gave unto me and he said I begin
[1:39:05] to watch he said he said there he said
[1:39:08] there's certain different snakes that
[1:39:09] have different different abilities as
[1:39:11] soon as they strike you if you don't get
[1:39:12] to the hospital you're dead he said but
[1:39:14] over there in that foreign country he
[1:39:17] said when men hear that word Mamba they
[1:39:19] run and they beat their heads because
[1:39:22] they know that it's sudden death that it
[1:39:25] was sudden death and brother bandam said
[1:39:26] he said there I was he said I was
[1:39:28] watching in this Vision he said and that
[1:39:31] Vision was that Vision was showing that
[1:39:33] Mamba and said he kept that Mamba kept
[1:39:35] coming at me he said but he couldn't get
[1:39:37] to me he couldn't get to me and he said
[1:39:39] when he couldn't get to me he started
[1:39:41] going after my friend and he said then I
[1:39:44] begin to see that my friend was jumping
[1:39:46] up through those weeds just kept jumping
[1:39:48] up here and jumping up there and he said
[1:39:50] I thought
[1:39:51] oh Lord he said if that strikes him it's
[1:39:54] death immediately he said I begin to
[1:39:57] look at that and I begin to think and he
[1:39:58] said I'll begin to look at it he said
[1:40:01] then all of a sudden he said the word of
[1:40:03] the Lord came unto me and said you've
[1:40:06] been given power to bind
[1:40:12] that now notice I'm going to go through
[1:40:15] that just a little bit just a little bit
[1:40:18] but notice what the what the angel says
[1:40:20] to him
[1:40:22] he asked the question what must I do
[1:40:26] what must I
[1:40:27] do this is where I find myself what must
[1:40:30] I do what must I do he said you must
[1:40:35] must be
[1:40:39] sincere now it wasn't that brother
[1:40:41] random wasn't sincere very much the
[1:40:43] contrary you can look throughout all of
[1:40:45] brother bram's Ministry hear it on tape
[1:40:47] and hear all the testimonies brother
[1:40:49] brandham had a sincerity that was a deep
[1:40:51] sincerity he was he was led of the Lord
[1:40:54] in everything and it's not that I'm
[1:40:55] preaching to you that you're not sincere
[1:40:57] but it's very much
[1:40:59] contrary I believe that you're one of
[1:41:01] the most sincere people that I know of
[1:41:04] but I believe that we as the body of
[1:41:06] Jesus Christ we've been given something
[1:41:08] to us that we're held to a different
[1:41:11] standard come on somebody you are held
[1:41:14] higher than Paul was held to you're held
[1:41:17] higher than Luther was held to you're
[1:41:19] held higher than what Wesley was held
[1:41:21] too why is it you have been given a
[1:41:25] fully restored word of the hour and you
[1:41:29] are facing more demons than ever before
[1:41:33] than any other age Paul Luther Wesley
[1:41:37] Columba all of these men they've never
[1:41:39] faced all of these demons like you're
[1:41:43] facing it wasn't that brother random
[1:41:45] wasn't sincere but the angel was asking
[1:41:48] him or telling him you must be
[1:41:52] more more sincere I'd say if we would
[1:41:56] examine oursel right here there's
[1:41:58] definitely some areas that we could we
[1:42:00] could say yes I can be more sincere here
[1:42:04] come on somebody we got an extreme devil
[1:42:07] that is dealing with a man behind this
[1:42:09] Pulpit trying he's not just trying to
[1:42:11] make him sick he's trying to kill
[1:42:18] him that same Devil's after you
[1:42:21] that same Devil's after you today and if
[1:42:24] let me tell you something it's going to
[1:42:25] take more than you're just Penny Andy
[1:42:27] just going up and confessing going to
[1:42:29] the Altar and beating on the altar it's
[1:42:31] going to take real sincerity it wasn't
[1:42:34] that brother random wasn't sincere but
[1:42:36] the angel was giv him a commission what
[1:42:38] you've been given in your hand is the
[1:42:41] king sword you got to hold it right you
[1:42:44] got to hold it in your hand just right
[1:42:46] and be
[1:42:48] more more sincere
[1:42:51] what was it what was it he was calling
[1:42:56] for a
[1:42:57] deeper
[1:42:59] consecration a deeper
[1:43:01] sincerity a deeper
[1:43:04] walk because let me tell you something
[1:43:06] if this mama strikes that brother he's
[1:43:10] dead what happened when you go in
[1:43:12] Revelations chapter 6 let me get to the
[1:43:15] meat of my message now I've held you
[1:43:18] here but let me get to this
[1:43:22] when you look at Revelations and you
[1:43:24] start seeing the seals begin to break
[1:43:26] and you start seeing it through out of
[1:43:28] all the ages it's held
[1:43:31] there and all of the
[1:43:34] theologians even brother brandham
[1:43:36] thought at one point that was Christ
[1:43:37] riding on that white horse rider what
[1:43:40] did he do when he saw him going out in
[1:43:42] the first seal when it was broke what
[1:43:44] did he see he thought that was the
[1:43:46] mighty conqueror Christ himself he said
[1:43:48] I would have made a horrible mistake if
[1:43:50] the angel of the Lord had not come into
[1:43:52] the room he said that's not that
[1:43:54] Antichrist he said that's not the Christ
[1:43:56] he said it's that Antichrist and he's
[1:43:58] riding out there to conquer and to
[1:44:01] conquer what was he riding out there to
[1:44:03] he was riding out there to conquer the
[1:44:06] Le he was going out there trying to
[1:44:09] prove that he had the power to stop the
[1:44:12] Church of the Living God I want to say
[1:44:15] this to you the devil's not smart enough
[1:44:17] to stop
[1:44:18] you the devil's not ahead of you the
[1:44:21] devil's not ahead of God that Antichrist
[1:44:24] Rider is riding out there and you watch
[1:44:27] as it as it moves to the red from the
[1:44:29] white to the red to the black all the
[1:44:31] way down to the pale and what does
[1:44:33] brother bam do when he breaks open the
[1:44:34] fourth seal he said what is it he said
[1:44:37] notice notice what he does he Blends or
[1:44:41] merges himself together all three of
[1:44:43] them colors all them Powers merge
[1:44:46] together what is it he said it's those
[1:44:49] political and church Powers blendings
[1:44:52] together to cause an eternal separation
[1:44:55] that's what death is that's what this
[1:44:59] message is about sincerity brings power
[1:45:02] over death what was it these political
[1:45:06] and church Powers were combining
[1:45:08] themselves up in a pale
[1:45:11] horse look at people they're so confused
[1:45:14] today they don't know what they don't
[1:45:16] know what tribe they belong to they
[1:45:17] don't know whether they're male or
[1:45:18] female whether they're a cat or a dog
[1:45:21] notice this Pale Horse he can blend in
[1:45:24] he can fit right in notice how Lucifer
[1:45:26] comes in there notice how he those two
[1:45:29] Vines they're always connected together
[1:45:31] but don't you try to disconnect them
[1:45:33] it's the angel that disconnects them
[1:45:35] it's the messenger that disconnects them
[1:45:38] notice don't you do that job you just
[1:45:40] stay steadfast in the promises of God
[1:45:42] notice that angel that angel is standing
[1:45:46] there and it's announcing notice this
[1:45:48] pale horse rider what is he
[1:45:51] it's the only time that the horse rider
[1:45:53] is named and he's named death now notice
[1:45:58] when brother random goes in that vision
[1:45:59] of 1961 he said it's death out there
[1:46:02] it's death out there he said if that
[1:46:04] Mama strikes if that serpent strikes he
[1:46:07] said it's death out there he said if he

[1:46:11] sudden he said something came over top
[1:46:14] of me and charged me he said it charged

[1:46:39] he said and means bind this one and
[1:46:44] anything below it bind death and

[2:03:15] Elijah Enoch's family watched what
[2:03:18] happened to Enoch
[2:03:21] the disciples watch what happened with
[2:03:24] Jesus but this time when Jesus comes to
[2:03:27] get his body he ain't going to leave any

[2:11:16] father Lord I I recognize that sometimes
[2:11:20] a service like this it begins to get
[2:11:23] received and
[2:11:24] thinking where where we living at is
[2:11:26] there something that I could check
[2:11:29] up is there fingers being pointed to me
[2:11:31] is this is this it but what the word of
