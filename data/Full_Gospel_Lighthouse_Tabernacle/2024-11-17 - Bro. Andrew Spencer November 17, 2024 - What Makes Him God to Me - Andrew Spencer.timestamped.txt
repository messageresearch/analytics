[43:40] mind you are already pre-planting our
[43:43] existence here father and you see our
[43:47] hearts Lord today how we desire Lord to
[43:50] be in a place father that you could fill
[43:53] us Lord sometimes we've just got to get
[43:56] to a place where we
[43:57] empty out of ourselves empty out of our
[43:59] ways and empty out of traditions and
[44:01] empty out of what we know just to come
[44:04] close to you and father we ask Lord that
[44:07] you would pour out that you would begin
[44:09] to empty out yourself father Lord Jesus
[44:13] that word there in the Book of Joel it's
[44:16] such a special word it's not like the
[44:19] English word but you begin to kosis you
[44:22] begin to you begin to empty yourself out
[44:25] oh God pour yourself into your people

[44:34] in your word that you would come and
[44:36] Minister father you see every hand you
[44:38] see every heart Lord Jesus these people
[44:41] have traveled some of them traveling for
[44:45] hours or maybe even more to be in this
[44:47] service today and you know what they
[44:50] have on their heart I would ask Lord
[44:52] that you would be God today that you
[44:55] would move in this congregation and that
[44:57] you would bless your children Lord we
[44:59] didn't come here to see men we didn't
[45:01] come here to be lifted up by men we've
[45:04] come here to see and have an
[45:05] acquaintance with Elohim himself and I
[45:08] pray that you would just move today
[45:10] Father Lord I know that there are sick
[45:12] amongst us I know that there are lost
[45:15] that are here today I know that there
[45:17] are those that are Barren here amongst
[45:19] us but I know who you are Lord Jesus and
[45:23] you will not forget any of your promises
[45:25] to your children you are not slack
[45:27] concerning your promises but your
[45:29] promises are unto us yes and amen and we
[45:32] look unto you the author and the
[45:34] finisher of our faith father we just

[45:40] congregation today let your word be high

[45:53] dedicate this service to you in the name
[45:55] of Jesus Christ
[45:57] and the bride
[45:58] said amen amen if you have your Bibles
[46:02] today we'd like to invite you to look
[46:04] into the word of God With Us and there
[46:07] in the Book of Genesis chapter 1 and
[46:10] John chapter
[46:13] 1 I want to welcome our visitors here
[46:16] today every one of you I know there's
[46:18] some from Ohio and North Carolina and
[46:20] different places in Pennsylvania so we
[46:22] just want to welcome you here in the
[46:24] house of the Lord and say God richly
[46:26] bless you for being here here
[46:35] amen I would like to speak to you today
[46:38] on a little thought that's been on my
[46:40] heart for a couple weeks here and I'd
[46:43] like to take it from uh the message of
[46:45] the hour brother brandom says here in
[46:47] the message hear ye him he said you know
[46:50] our Lord he meets in Realms of men
[46:53] sometimes he meets in great groups of
[46:55] men some sometimes he meets with a few
[46:58] we have record of him meeting with 500
[47:01] one time after his resurrection and then
[47:03] we have where he met the 70 and with the
[47:06] 12 and even with the three and then we
[47:09] have times where he will meet with just
[47:11] one and I love this statement it's been
[47:13] always one of my favorite statements
[47:15] brother Brandon makes that's what makes
[47:18] him God to me is because that he is
[47:22] humility and the meanest man in Santa
[47:25] Maria he would say that's what makes him
[47:28] God to me he he then he and then there
[47:32] was another flunky that I was like the
[47:34] cheapest of flunky of all of them and
[47:37] that was the footwash and flunky he was
[47:39] the poorest paid man of the bunch that's
[47:42] what makes him God to me he was the
[47:45] highest of the highs and took the part
[47:48] of the footwash and flunky on Earth and
[47:50] he walked around and think and we walk
[47:53] around and think we're somebody and the
[47:55] god of Glory revealing the glory of God
[47:57] wash the feet of fishermen that's what
[48:00] makes him real become a servant the
[48:04] lowest of servants went down upon his
[48:06] knees to wash the feet of the very
[48:09] created dust that he
[48:12] made you think about how the brevity of
[48:15] this the brevity of this this context
[48:18] right here that's what makes him real is
[48:21] that he could make himself so high but
[48:24] he would become so low that he would
[48:26] wash the very dust off the feet of the
[48:29] creation that he made there he was down
[48:32] on his knees washing the feet the
[48:34] poorest paid man in the bunch and the
[48:37] worst job Genesis CH 1 and verse one
[48:42] from this text I'd like to take a
[48:43] thought today on what makes him God to
[48:47] me in the beginning God created the
[48:50] Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was
[48:54] without form and void and darkness was
[48:56] upon on the face of the deep and the
[48:58] spirit of God moved upon the face of the
[49:00] waters and God said let there be light
[49:04] and there was a lot in John chapter 1
[49:07] and verse
[49:10] one when brother Joe opened his text
[49:13] from this last night
[49:16] I constrained myself from having a
[49:18] shouting
[49:23] fed but I know what G
[49:27] is
[49:30] doing it might seem peculiar how he does
[49:33] things sometimes but that's just his
[49:36] ways in the beginning was the word and
[49:41] the Word was with God and the Word was
[49:44] God the same was in the beginning with
[49:47] God all things were made by him and
[49:51] without him was not anything made that
[49:55] was made may God bless his word you may
[49:57] be seated today in the presence of the
[49:58] Lord also in the Book of Matthew chapter
[50:01] 9 and verse 10 and I'd like just to have
[50:05] your undivided attention as much as we
[50:08] possibly can here today the Bible says
[50:11] here that it came to pass that as Jesus
[50:14] sat at meat in the house behold many
[50:17] publicans and sinners came and sat down
[50:20] with him and his disciples and when the
[50:23] Pharisees saw it they said unto his
[50:25] disciples why e your master with the
[50:27] publicans and the Sinners but when Jesus
[50:30] heard that he said unto them they that
[50:33] be whole need not a physician but they
[50:38] that are sick they that are sick and we
[50:40] realize that that God in the beginning
[50:43] as brother Joe so he so perfectly placed
[50:46] it together last night that God in the
[50:49] beginning was not necessarily God
[50:51] because to be a god there has to be
[50:53] something to worship you and you think
[50:56] about these texts that we are reading
[50:58] here today we realize that God uses
[51:01] prophets to be able to bring the Word of
[51:03] Life to to their position and to their
[51:06] place and God would Pro he would he
[51:08] would liken His prophets under the
[51:10] Eagles and and even when Moses is
[51:12] writing the Book of Genesis he was not
[51:15] there as per se but by the inspiration
[51:17] of the Holy Ghost he is able to go all
[51:20] the way back to the very mind of
[51:22] almighty God he's there and he's able to
[51:25] look at Adam as he's coming out of
[51:27] creation he's able to watch Adam as as
[51:29] he's moving creation and throughout the
[51:31] abilities he is able by prophetic instru
[51:35] instrumentality is able to look there
[51:38] and to be able to see God in the
[51:39] beginning when there was no atams and
[51:42] when there was no molecules there was
[51:45] almighty God that was setting there and
[51:47] then he would use the he would use the
[51:49] anointing of the eagle that would fall
[51:51] upon John that John being the guard one
[51:54] of the guards to the book of Acts he
[51:56] lays it in there he's able to be able to
[51:59] look in there by that eagle anointing to
[52:01] be able to look in there and to see that
[52:03] in the beginning was the word of God
[52:06] when there was nothing else the word was
[52:08] right there and you begin to think about
[52:11] how the message of the hour has painted
[52:13] a picture so that us as Sons and
[52:15] Daughters of God we don't have to
[52:17] imagine what God is like we don't have
[52:19] to wonder what God is like but by the
[52:22] message of the hour we have the ability
[52:24] to be able to look through the prophetic
[52:26] Optics and be able to look all the way
[52:29] back there in the beginning brother
[52:30] Brandon would say when when there was no
[52:32] light and when there was no atams he
[52:34] would take us out upon the banister of
[52:36] time and he would lay out there and he
[52:38] would say he said there was God he said
[52:40] there was no light there was no Darkness
[52:42] he said there was absolutely nothing
[52:44] there he said but in that God was there
[52:48] when there was nothing else God was
[52:50] there God was he did not God did not be
[52:54] God did not just he didn't just create
[52:56] things he was always God he was always
[53:00] Elohim the self-existing one because we
[53:03] recognize that we wouldn't understand
[53:05] what God is but we realize that Jesus
[53:08] came and he said no man ha seen God but
[53:11] the only begotten of the father he hath
[53:14] declared him and when Jesus become he
[53:17] was standing there and we were literally
[53:19] Watching God In the Flesh we were seeing
[53:23] him as who he truly was he wanted to be
[53:28] God and brother random would take us out
[53:30] there and he said then all of a sudden
[53:32] he said you would begin to watch he said
[53:34] we sitting there he said we watched that
[53:36] very sacred light he said we would call
[53:38] it a Halo of light as it would begin to
[53:40] come out he said it was the anointing of
[53:43] God the logos of God the word of God he
[53:45] said and it come out and it come out he
[53:47] said it come out there and he said it
[53:49] had he said the world he created the
[53:52] world and the world was there he said it
[53:54] was nothing but a great big ball of ice
[53:56] he said and there that Halo of light
[53:58] went all the way down through the
[53:59] Northlands and it come all the way down
[54:01] through Canada and it went all the way
[54:03] down through Kansas and down into Texas
[54:06] and and it it be to cut out places in
[54:08] Mexico and and there the spirit of God
[54:10] begin to move on it and the waters were
[54:13] there and God spoke and said let the
[54:15] waters go to their place and all of a
[54:18] sudden he allowed the vegetation to be
[54:20] able to come right out of the very
[54:22] manifestation of the word of God that he
[54:24] spoke because there was seed there that
[54:27] was from another world and he spoke life
[54:30] to those seeds and that life came up out
[54:32] of there it was something that was
[54:34] already there but that Halo of light
[54:36] that was there had to come across it to
[54:39] bring that seed that had been
[54:43] deratization out then he created the
[54:46] moon and the moon he he be to watch as
[54:49] the moon as it would begin to form and
[54:51] he he would roll it out off of his
[54:52] fingertips and he would go it out there
[54:54] and let it roll out there for a me
[54:56] million years and brother Brandon would
[54:57] say it like this that he rolled it out
[54:59] there off of his fingertips and he got
[55:01] it to its perfect position and he
[55:03] stopped it in its perfect place he set
[55:06] the moon there so that he could set the
[55:08] boundaries for the sea so that the sea
[55:10] could only go so far upon the land
[55:13] because he he wanted everything just in
[55:15] a perfect spot the way that he was
[55:17] looking at it he wanted to be that but
[55:19] yet there was he was still not God he
[55:22] was so he wanted to be God so he he
[55:24] created Angelic beings so that they
[55:27] would worship him I think that's the
[55:29] greatest thing that we could do as Sons
[55:31] and Daughters of God is we recognize
[55:34] that we're not just here to be singers
[55:36] that we're not just here to be people
[55:38] that clap our hands and say Amen but we
[55:40] are here to be worshippers of the
[55:43] almighty God whether it's in song or
[55:45] whether it's Amen or whether whatever
[55:47] everything that we ought to do is to be
[55:50] if God wanted to be God as the very
[55:53] first thing that he would create his
[55:55] angels then what about us if he would
[55:58] create worshippers that would worship
[56:00] him that don't know Amazing Grace how
[56:03] much
[56:05] more you can make anything your God you
[56:08] can make this pull pit your God you can
[56:11] make basketball your God you can make
[56:13] baseball your God you can make football
[56:15] your God you can make Idols your God but
[56:18] what makes him God to you I don't want
[56:21] to know what the gods of the world what
[56:24] what why they choose to serve that that
[56:26] kind of a God but what makes God to me
[56:30] sir I don't know what makes God to you
[56:33] but I know what makes God to me he is
[56:36] still the almighty he is still the same
[56:38] yesterday today and forever his word is
[56:41] not changing he's still a Healer he's
[56:44] still a provider he's still a way maker
[56:47] that's what makes him God to
[56:54] me that part of God
[56:56] begin to develop
[56:58] something so human beings could have
[57:01] some type of idea of what he was the
[57:05] word of
[57:06] God by the word Psalms 33 and6 by the
[57:10] word of the Lord were the heavens made
[57:12] and the host of them by the breath of
[57:14] his mouth and he gathered the Waters of
[57:16] the sea together as a heap he layeth up
[57:18] the depths in its storehouses he let the
[57:21] Earth let all the Earth fear the lord
[57:23] and let all the inhabitants of this
[57:25] world stand in all of him for he spake
[57:27] it and it was done he commanded it and
[57:31] it stood fast Hallelujah you think that
[57:34] all of these things were in almighty God
[57:37] the prophet would tell us that all of
[57:39] these attributes were in
[57:41] him attributes of God attributes of
[57:44] Father attributes of son attributes of
[57:46] healer they were they were in him all of
[57:49] these attributes were inherently in God
[57:52] and you and I before all of that was
[57:55] ever created it you and I was in his
[57:58] mind you and I as Sons and Daughters of
[58:00] God as a gene as The Offspring of God we
[58:03] are as Eternal as God as is eternal in
[58:07] the beginning he was eternal when there
[58:09] is no more time he will still be Eternal
[58:13] when there is no more Michael Jordan he
[58:15] will still be Elohim when there is no
[58:17] more Tom Brady he will still be Elohim
[58:21] when there is no more danap Patrick he
[58:23] will still be almighty God when when
[58:26] there is no more Biden and when there is
[58:28] no more Trump when there is no more
[58:30] Harris he will still be
[58:36] God
[58:37] hallelujah and almighty God determined
[58:40] where you would be placed at and he had
[58:42] a purpose in every single one of your
[58:44] lives how he placed you here he's got a
[58:47] purpose in your being here he
[58:48] predestinated your coming and he you I
[58:51] want to say it like this you were is
[58:53] eternal when Paul was here and as are
[58:56] you right now you are as Eternal right
[58:59] now as just the same way when Columbo
[59:02] was here you are Eternal then as you are
[59:05] Eternal now come on somebody you were
[59:08] Eternal before Moses ever saw Adam
[59:11] walking out of the Garden of Eden you
[59:13] are
[59:15] Eternal Eternal comes from the very mind
[59:18] of
[59:20] God and you have the
[59:24] identity of almighty God
[59:26] on the inside of
[59:28] you your identity sometimes it changes
[59:32] throughout life you look at your life
[59:34] you look at your baby pictures and a lot
[59:37] of you do not look exactly like you did
[59:39] when you were born here thank God it
[59:42] ain't a whole lot of pretty
[59:45] babies except for those that just had
[59:47] one you think it's the cutest thing but
[59:50] your identity changes but if brother
[59:52] Gabriel stops you on the side of the
[59:54] road and he's going to give you a ticket
[59:56] and he asked for your identity card you
[59:58] are not going to show him your baby
[1:00:00] picture because you don't look like that
[1:00:04] but you pull out the picture of the
[1:00:05] status that you are at the moment maybe
[1:00:08] let me say it like this you are not what
[1:00:11] you were when you were first started so
[1:00:14] pull out your identity as a son and
[1:00:17] daughter of almighty God you were not
[1:00:19] what you were when you came to the altar
[1:00:21] you were not what you were when you met
[1:00:24] him out there in your car you were not
[1:00:26] what you were but by the grace of God I
[1:00:29] am a Son of
[1:00:31] God my
[1:00:34] identity is in the
[1:00:39] kingship as an American the prophet
[1:00:41] would teach us in spiritual Amnesia I'm
[1:00:43] identified with her on Plymouth Rock I'm
[1:00:46] identified riding with Paul with Paul
[1:00:49] there as he's as he's riding down
[1:00:51] through there and warning that the
[1:00:53] British is coming I'm identified when
[1:00:55] they ra a flag on Gom I stood with her
[1:00:58] in her glory I stood with her in her
[1:01:00] shame but if I'm identified as an
[1:01:02] American how much more as a son and
[1:01:04] daughter of almighty God I'm identified
[1:01:08] I was there with Abraham when he had
[1:01:10] Faith to believe for Isaac I was there
[1:01:12] with Jacob when he was wrestling with
[1:01:14] the angel I was there I was there with
[1:01:18] Daniel in the Lion's Den I was there
[1:01:20] with the three Hebrew children when they
[1:01:22] were going through the fiery furnace
[1:01:26] I'm identified in every one of America's
[1:01:28] victories and I'm identified in all of
[1:01:30] their defeats I'm identified in the
[1:01:32] challenges on 911 but I am identified
[1:01:36] with a God that rose up on Easter
[1:01:38] morning and proved he's my God he's more
[1:01:42] than enough death couldn't stop him the
[1:01:45] grave couldn't stop him hell couldn't
[1:01:47] stop him I tell you what makes in God to
[1:01:50] me is that he came from the ramp parts
[1:01:52] of
[1:01:54] heaven and he came came all the
[1:01:58] way to
[1:02:00] me I don't know what makes him God to
[1:02:04] you but I know what makes him God to
[1:02:08] me he would tell us in his word that he
[1:02:12] was going to give us a messiah sign that
[1:02:14] the Lord himself would give you a sign
[1:02:16] that Behold a virgin shall conceive
[1:02:18] she's going to Bear a son and should
[1:02:20] call his name Emmanuel the prophet would
[1:02:22] say For unto us a child is born unto us

[1:03:41] looking at when Adam was created and
[1:03:44] when Eve was created and I want to
[1:03:46] declare to you that the God that was
[1:03:48] back there is the god that is right

[1:04:19] Jesus can set you free from the bondage
[1:04:22] of sin and of death from the change of
[1:04:24] your past but it's it's only in the name
[1:04:27] of Jesus Jesus is the name of all of
[1:04:32] Heaven All Of Heaven There Is Power
[1:04:34] behind
[1:04:36] it he said all power in Heaven and Earth
[1:04:39] is given unto me and when the disciples
[1:04:41] were standing there in the book of Acts
[1:04:44] chapter 4 he said there's neither
[1:04:46] salvation in any other name the name of
[1:04:48] a pope can't save you the name of a
[1:04:50] bishop can't save you the name of some
[1:04:52] Prophet can't save you but the name of
[1:04:55] Jesus Christ Christ will save you from
[1:04:57] the worst of
[1:04:58] sins Hallelujah and I'll tell you this
[1:05:01] kind of God has the ability to roll away
[1:05:04] your Phantom Pains of who you are
[1:05:07] because the name of Jesus will save your
[1:05:14] memory I know young people you deal with
[1:05:16] battles in your mind and complexes in
[1:05:18] your mind but I believe the message of
[1:05:20] the Hour come to roll away the reproach
[1:05:22] of your life that the things that you
[1:05:24] did in your childhood that the things
[1:05:27] that you were subjected to the message
[1:05:29] of the hour Rose
[1:05:32] Hallelujah yeah you got memories here
[1:05:34] but let the
[1:05:36] message roll them memories right out of
[1:05:38] your life if he's a God that can create
[1:05:41] words and speak them into existence he
[1:05:44] can demolish your
[1:05:47] memories
[1:05:49] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:05:51] [Applause]
[1:05:59] brother Brandon would say it like this
[1:06:01] and lifting him up out of history and I
[1:06:03] think that's a great thing to do that's
[1:06:05] what I'm going to do to you today I'm
[1:06:07] going to lift the God I know out of
[1:06:08] History he said what good does it do to
[1:06:10] preach a god of History if he isn't the
[1:06:12] same today any brother and sister I say
[1:06:15] I I read of a god of History one time I
[1:06:17] read of him in books I read of him in
[1:06:19] the Bible but one day I met
[1:06:22] him he would say in scriptural signs of
[1:06:25] the time witch doctors and everything
[1:06:27] can challenge you to it he said you
[1:06:29] better know what you're talking about
[1:06:31] you better not just have an intellectual
[1:06:33] talk I like that you better be able by
[1:06:37] God to support what you're talking about
[1:06:39] or don't get on the field somewhere he
[1:06:41] said because they'll make you
[1:06:44] embarrassed you better know what you're
[1:06:46] talking about when you go up against an
[1:06:48] Infidel and a agnostic and atheist you
[1:06:51] better know what you're talking about
[1:06:52] because they have studied your Bible
[1:06:54] sometimes more than what You' studied it
[1:06:56] trying to disprove there is a God so
[1:06:59] they will embarrass you but I love what
[1:07:01] the prophet said he said but remember
[1:07:04] our God is still the god of
[1:07:07] Elijah he is still the god that ever was
[1:07:10] he's still the same God he moves in the
[1:07:12] same cycle he does the same thing he is
[1:07:15] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:07:17] I've seen them stand up and be
[1:07:19] dumbfounded paralyzed and taken off the
[1:07:22] field because God still remain remains
[1:07:27] God in Co he was God through cancer he
[1:07:33] has been God throughout leosia he will
[1:07:36] still be
[1:07:38] God because the Bible teaches us that
[1:07:42] where the word of a king is there's
[1:07:44] power now if a natural King has the
[1:07:47] ability and the authority to be able to
[1:07:50] speak laws into existence how much
[1:07:52] greater is the king of kings his word
[1:07:55] his word does not change but the Bible
[1:07:58] tells us that where the word of a king
[1:08:00] is there is power if a king can make an
[1:08:04] authority he can make a decree to have a
[1:08:07] such and such tax law and that he can
[1:08:10] beat the people down it simply has to
[1:08:13] stay in place until another king changes
[1:08:16] the decree there was another King on
[1:08:19] your heart that was making you pay taxes
[1:08:22] to sin but when the King of Kings set
[1:08:26] upon the throne room of your heart those
[1:08:28] decrees
[1:08:32] changed Hallelujah you're not under some
[1:08:34] Bishop you're not under some Pope I want
[1:08:37] to say this to you you're not just under
[1:08:39] some man's idea you're not under some
[1:08:42] ideology but you're under the
[1:08:45] kingdom and where the word of the king
[1:08:49] is what has been handed to you in this
[1:08:52] generation none else but the sword of a
[1:08:56] [Applause]
[1:09:00] king
[1:09:03] Hallelujah you know a a
[1:09:06] Shepherd as they working in the vast
[1:09:10] Countryside they they have the ability
[1:09:14] to train their sheep to their
[1:09:17] voice and it's amazing how the prophet
[1:09:20] would would parallel that to the message
[1:09:23] he would lay those things in there that
[1:09:25] he would be in those Eastern countries
[1:09:27] how that the shepherd there could be
[1:09:29] hundreds of shepherds working through
[1:09:30] the field they'd be working but those
[1:09:32] sheep paid attention to only one voice
[1:09:35] it was a voice of their Shepherd and
[1:09:37] that Shepherd has the ability because
[1:09:40] those sheep are completely helpless
[1:09:42] they're depending on that Shepherd for
[1:09:44] their safety for their protection and
[1:09:47] maybe when coyotes and wolves get to
[1:09:49] working around the fields they the the
[1:09:51] shepherd simply would raise his he would
[1:09:54] raise his staff for he would say such
[1:09:56] and such word that the Sheep are are are
[1:09:59] used to so he he he creates a a command
[1:10:02] so that they're used to I was reading a
[1:10:04] story about a about a Shepherd that that
[1:10:06] he was working out in a in a fieldside
[1:10:08] and he was there on the on the on the
[1:10:10] Hills there and there this little sheep
[1:10:12] got to bleeding and the shepherd was
[1:10:14] watching the entire time and he kept
[1:10:16] getting further and further away from
[1:10:17] the flock and the Sheep just kept
[1:10:19] bleeding but his bleeding attracted a
[1:10:22] wolf that came around and the Wolf good
[1:10:24] out got to circling and it kept pushing
[1:10:26] the Sheep out there further but the but
[1:10:29] the shepherd simply hollered out
[1:10:32] stay and the Sheep Stood Still and it
[1:10:36] froze in its tracks right there stay and
[1:10:39] the shepherd was able to go in there and
[1:10:42] be able to retrieve the sheep and keep
[1:10:44] them from all
[1:10:45] harm now if a shepherd's got that
[1:10:47] ability yes sir now I know y'all are I
[1:10:50] know I know y'all are well trained in
[1:10:52] preaching so you know where I'm already
[1:10:53] going you know where I'm going so if he
[1:10:56] has that kind of ability to Simply say
[1:10:58] the word
[1:10:59] stay come on Ruth don't go nowhere else
[1:11:03] stay right here don't go to this field
[1:11:06] don't go to that field stop wondering
[1:11:08] out to denominations stop wondering out
[1:11:11] to ideas stay stay right here stay in
[1:11:15] this message stay in this this is the
[1:11:18] King's word there is power Hallelujah if
[1:11:22] the shepherd has the ability to make a
[1:11:24] command
[1:11:25] how much greater is almighty God to be
[1:11:28] able to put a message in your mouth put
[1:11:30] a message in your hand and say
[1:11:33] stay I'll say this if you put this
[1:11:36] message in your mouth every Devil's got
[1:11:38] to back away and Let The Shepherd of the
[1:11:41] Sheepfold come back
[1:11:44] in I know you've been through some times
[1:11:47] when it seems like the Wolves of hell
[1:11:49] are circling you around but I want to
[1:11:51] say this to you I am not alone the
[1:11:54] shepherd is amongst
[1:11:57] us somebody give God a hand clap of
[1:12:00] [Applause]
[1:12:10] praise that's what makes him God to
[1:12:17] me
[1:12:18] God means an object of
[1:12:23] worship I can worship him on that
[1:12:29] thought I can worship him that his word
[1:12:32] is
[1:12:33] absolute I can worship him knowing that
[1:12:35] nothing else matters as long as I got
[1:12:37] his word that no matter what you go
[1:12:40] through as long as you've got the word
[1:12:42] of a king you're going to be okay
[1:12:44] because this king is on your side when
[1:12:47] you didn't know he was on your side he
[1:12:49] is on your side he cares for you when
[1:12:51] you feel like that you are unlovable and
[1:12:54] there should nobody caring for you he is
[1:12:56] the one that's got his eye on the
[1:12:59] sparrow Hallelujah if he can walk down
[1:13:02] when the king had made a decree that
[1:13:04] anybody that would not bow to the image
[1:13:06] of Daniel that they would be thrown into
[1:13:09] the fiery furnace at the sounding of the
[1:13:11] trumpet at the sounding of music that if
[1:13:13] anybody didn't
[1:13:16] bow then they'd be thrown into the fiery
[1:13:18] furnace but they did not build their
[1:13:22] idea upon the man's words of a the
[1:13:25] king's words in that in the in the world
[1:13:27] of a realm of a man but they had built
[1:13:30] their absolute on the king's
[1:13:36] word I love how brother brandham
[1:13:40] dramatizes how the Angels would come to
[1:13:43] him said God are you looking down there
[1:13:46] in Babylon are you seeing what's taking
[1:13:49] place are you capturing the view of this
[1:13:53] wormwood came to him gave came to him
[1:13:56] all the Angels Came to him said let me
[1:13:58] go down there let me go down I'll go
[1:14:01] down there I'll get him out of trouble I
[1:14:04] love go the prophet said he he grabbed a
[1:14:06] hold of a zigzag lightning he said oh no
[1:14:09] I've had my eyes on them all night long
[1:14:12] and there is nothing going to come harm
[1:14:13] to them because I've had my ey on them
[1:14:16] all night long and before they knew it
[1:14:19] he was standing in the
[1:14:22] fire I say this to you he said God
[1:14:25] that'll go through the fire again he'll
[1:14:27] go through the fire with you again let
[1:14:30] me say this to you they were standing
[1:14:32] there and they said we will not bow we
[1:14:34] don't know what he will do but I know
[1:14:36] what he's able to do and I tell you this
[1:14:39] I don't know what God will do but I know
[1:14:41] what he's able to do he's able to give a
[1:14:43] Rapture he's able to give a body change
[1:14:46] he's able to heal you to the uttermost
[1:14:57] that's what makes him God to
[1:15:03] me before you got in your mess he had
[1:15:07] his eye on
[1:15:08] you you remember when brother Timothy
[1:15:11] standing here a few years ago and he's
[1:15:13] taken us down this story line some of
[1:15:15] you how many was here when this happened
[1:15:17] you know what I'm talking about before I
[1:15:18] get
[1:15:19] there I come on now I know I've got a
[1:15:23] whole lot of new members here in the
[1:15:24] last year but I know some of y'all are
[1:15:26] here I ain't got my glasses on but I got
[1:15:28] a good idea that some of y'all are here
[1:15:30] in that
[1:15:31] meeting you remember brother Timothy I
[1:15:34] know you brother Timothy is going down
[1:15:36] that line and all of a sudden brother
[1:15:38] Timothy's iPad starts
[1:15:40] playing out of nowhere his iPad starts
[1:15:44] playing brother Greg's standing right
[1:15:45] here getting ready to play the guitar
[1:15:46] and he watches his iPad cut on and
[1:15:48] brother brandham is saying he said oh I
[1:15:51] love that song of brother booth cbor and
[1:15:54] he's the song that brother random is
[1:15:56] referring to is down from his
[1:16:01] glory now you don't you may not
[1:16:04] understand the the elements of the
[1:16:06] supernatural right there but brother
[1:16:08] Timothy didn't turn the iPad on brother
[1:16:10] Timothy didn't even have it playing but
[1:16:12] God wanted to assure to the BR family
[1:16:15] what they were getting ready to go
[1:16:16] through with their mother leaving and
[1:16:18] and all of the things that they were
[1:16:20] going through God was saying I'm coming
[1:16:22] down from my glory
[1:16:25] I'm not sending an angel down there I'm
[1:16:28] coming
[1:16:33] myself that's what makes him God to
[1:16:36] me I love what Paul said to the
[1:16:38] Philippian in the Philippian letter
[1:16:40] verse chapter 2 and 5 let this mind be
[1:16:42] in you which was also in Christ Jesus
[1:16:45] who being in the form of God thought it
[1:16:47] not robbery to be made equal with God
[1:16:49] but he made himself of no reputation and
[1:16:52] took upon him the form of a servant and
[1:16:55] was made in the likeness of men and
[1:16:57] being found in fashion as a man he
[1:16:59] humbled himself and became obedient unto
[1:17:02] death even to the death of the Cross
[1:17:04] wherefore God has also highly exalted
[1:17:08] him and given him a name which is above
[1:17:10] every name that at the name of Jesus
[1:17:13] every knee should bow things in heaven
[1:17:16] and things in Earth and things under the
[1:17:18] Earth that every tongue should confess
[1:17:21] that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory
[1:17:25] of God the
[1:17:27] father that's what makes him God to
[1:17:32] me
[1:17:34] amen the disciples were
[1:17:37] worried about the identity of their
[1:17:40] Messiah we got to protect him we got to
[1:17:43] take care of him we got to watch over
[1:17:46] him we got to take
[1:17:48] care Peter really thought that he was
[1:17:51] going to be the guy that really took
[1:17:52] care of him
[1:17:55] he pulled a sword for him he was willing
[1:17:57] to get in the flesh for Jesus there's a
[1:17:59] whole lot of people that are willing to
[1:18:01] get in the flesh for Jesus but I want to
[1:18:03] know are you willing to get there in
[1:18:04] your soul realm are you willing to fight
[1:18:07] past your own flesh past fight past your
[1:18:10] own ideas to get into the
[1:18:14] atmosphere they were worried what people
[1:18:17] were going to say about their Messiah
[1:18:19] when he's sitting down he and all of a
[1:18:21] sudden Jesus starts acting peculiar he
[1:18:23] starts acting real pear and he says you
[1:18:26] know what now y'all go down this way but
[1:18:27] I'm going over here because I got an
[1:18:30] appointment I got to sit down with a
[1:18:32] woman by a whale they were worried about
[1:18:34] the Optics of what what Jesus is going
[1:18:37] to look like sitting down with a woman
[1:18:39] of ill Fame but Jesus is not concerned
[1:18:43] about the Optics of the outside world of
[1:18:45] what he looks like because he's almighty
[1:18:48] God he will sat down with the lowest of
[1:18:51] lows he will let a prostitute wash his
[1:18:54] feet Hallelujah he will sit down at a
[1:18:57] whale just to make sure his seed gets to
[1:18:59] him he's that kind of a God he'll die on
[1:19:02] the cross beside a beside a
[1:19:05] thief he's that kind of a God he will
[1:19:08] touch a leper and make him whole he'll
[1:19:11] touch a Blind Man's eyes and turn a
[1:19:13] blind man into a preacher said whether I
[1:19:16] done whether he's a sinner or not I know
[1:19:19] but this one thing I do know I once was
[1:19:21] blind but now I see
[1:19:28] he's
[1:19:30] God and He will always forever remain
[1:19:35] [Applause]
[1:19:41] God what about
[1:19:44] me what about me brother
[1:19:48] Andrew brother R would say it like this
[1:19:50] he's not your lord until you make him
[1:19:53] your lord
[1:19:55] amen I've made him Lord but what about
[1:20:00] you is he God to you is he Lord to you
[1:20:05] is he savior to you many of you whether
[1:20:08] he's your savior or not he's been a
[1:20:09] Healer to you whether you've seen him or
[1:20:11] not but one of these days you will
[1:20:14] worship him whether you choose to do it
[1:20:17] here or whether you choose to do it on
[1:20:19] Judgment Day every knee will bow and
[1:20:22] every tongue will confess so why I wait
[1:20:25] until that day let me bow and worship
[1:20:28] the god that is when I don't see him
[1:20:31] he's God when I don't feel him he's God
[1:20:34] when I don't even know that he's there
[1:20:36] he's still almighty
[1:20:40] God
[1:20:42] hallelujah he ain't worried about where
[1:20:45] you are he ain't worried about your
[1:20:46] storm he ain't worried about your chaos
[1:20:49] he's God
[1:20:55] that's
[1:20:57] right I love what brother Brandon would
[1:20:59] say and who is this he said God wanted
[1:21:02] to be
[1:21:03] worshiped so he had to project something
[1:21:07] that would worship Him

[1:21:13] God is a spirit and they that worship
[1:21:15] Him must worship Him in spirit and in
[1:21:17] truth and I love what he says he said so

[1:22:43] die in 1965 but my God is still alive
[1:22:47] and well
[1:22:59] Hallelujah I love this
[1:23:01] scripture in 1 chonicles
[1:23:06] 17-6 I got to reading this the other
[1:23:09] day and I know that that David is one of
[1:23:12] your favorite
[1:23:15] characters verse chapter 17 verse 16 the
[1:23:18] first
[1:23:19] Chronicles I I want you
[1:23:22] to just to picture of this in your mind
[1:23:26] like a father and son sitting
[1:23:30] down and having a
[1:23:33] conversation and God is getting ready to
[1:23:36] have a conversation with
[1:23:38] David and David is just heard some
[1:23:42] pretty tough
[1:23:43] news David is the kind of guy that he is
[1:23:46] he's after God's Own
[1:23:48] Heart he loves almighty God through
[1:23:51] everything that's right and he looks on
[1:23:54] David looks on his own
[1:23:56] life and he's like Lord you you put me
[1:23:59] here what about
[1:24:01] you what house can I build
[1:24:05] you David's David's in a spot he's
[1:24:08] looking at all the things that God's put
[1:24:10] around him and David said Lord what
[1:24:12] about your
[1:24:14] house and God speaks to him through the
[1:24:16] prophet Nathan and he tells him said
[1:24:19] because you have shed so much
[1:24:21] blood I can't let you build me a house
[1:24:23] but I'm going to allow your son Solomon
[1:24:25] to build me a house now look at verse 16
[1:24:28] and onward how beautiful this is that
[1:24:32] even after David goes to a spot where it
[1:24:35] looks like God is rejecting what he is
[1:24:38] saying to him David the king came and
[1:24:42] sat before the
[1:24:47] Lord this is some this is some major
[1:24:50] things that you're watching
[1:24:52] here David could have come in and he
[1:24:54] could have bowed down on his knees he
[1:24:56] could have set Indian style he could
[1:24:58] have just sat down but he's setting
[1:25:00] before the Lord and said who am I oh
[1:25:04] Lord oh God what is my house that thou
[1:25:07] has brought me hither to and yet this
[1:25:09] was a small thing in mine eyes oh God
[1:25:12] for thou has spoken of thy servant's
[1:25:14] house for a great while to come and H
[1:25:16] has regarded me according to the estate
[1:25:18] of man of high degree oh Lord God what
[1:25:21] can David speak more to thee for the
[1:25:24] honor of thy servant for thou knowest
[1:25:27] thy servant oh lord for thy servant sake
[1:25:30] and according to thine own heart hast
[1:25:32] thou done all this greatness in my known
[1:25:34] making known all these great things oh
[1:25:36] Lord there is none like thee neither is
[1:25:39] there any God beside thee according to
[1:25:42] all that we have heard with our ears
[1:25:45] after all that David had been through
[1:25:48] through all of his highs and through all
[1:25:49] of his lows he still had an audience
[1:25:54] with the almighty
[1:25:56] God that David would say it in the Book
[1:25:59] of Psalms that I set the lord always
[1:26:01] before me that I might not sin against
[1:26:08] him and David's in this
[1:26:12] position looking at the almighty knowing
[1:26:15] that his plans are greater than the
[1:26:18] king's plans himself amen
[1:26:25] but David could turn and
[1:26:27] say that's what makes him God to me is
[1:26:31] said he
[1:26:33] didn't he didn't reject me he didn't
[1:26:36] refuse me but he allowed me to sit down
[1:26:40] even after all of my killings even after
[1:26:43] all of my mistakes of bringing in 500
[1:26:46] different women he still allow me to
[1:26:51] bring in the materials to dress
[1:26:55] his
[1:26:56] children he allowed me to be this
[1:27:01] close now I want you just to
[1:27:05] imagine I want you to imagine a very hot
[1:27:09] desert and I want you to imagine this
[1:27:11] this weary traveler working through the
[1:27:13] working through the the desert the sun's
[1:27:17] beating down on him he's went days upon
[1:27:19] days without any water and he's
[1:27:21] constantly going he's he he is is
[1:27:24] constantly looking and he's his lips are
[1:27:26] parched his his lips are starting to
[1:27:28] crack his son's the sun is beating down
[1:27:30] on him and he is his body's beginning to
[1:27:32] ache he's been without water he's in a
[1:27:35] condition he's in a condition and all of
[1:27:37] a sudden he gets to a place where false
[1:27:39] hopes starts arising and mirages start
[1:27:41] coming up and he he starts looking out
[1:27:43] there and he sees he starts seeing the
[1:27:45] shimmering of a pools of of water out
[1:27:47] there in front of him and he he starts
[1:27:48] running out there and he finds out it's
[1:27:49] just another false hope and it's it's he
[1:27:52] runs out there and he sees another one
[1:27:53] he runs out there and it's just another
[1:27:55] false hope false hope is like a
[1:27:57] denomination it's like Amusements of the
[1:27:59] world it's like sins of the world it has
[1:28:01] no power to fill you but it'll actually
[1:28:03] leave you emptier than what you were
[1:28:05] before you ever got in that condition
[1:28:07] but as this man is getting ready to
[1:28:09] stagger and getting ready to fall under
[1:28:11] the weight of of being so parched
[1:28:13] without water he looks out there and he
[1:28:16] sees a real true Oasis in a desert and
[1:28:18] he finds that there is some pure cool
[1:28:20] water out there and the man is restored
[1:28:23] back I say say it like this you may have
[1:28:25] been thirsty for the water you may have
[1:28:27] been thirsty for some truth you may have
[1:28:29] been thirsting for some message but I
[1:28:31] want to say the spirit of almighty God
[1:28:33] sought you out maybe when you was in a
[1:28:35] weary desert all by yourself looking for
[1:28:38] truth and false hopes kept coming
[1:28:41] arising but I want to say this to you
[1:28:43] don't give up
[1:28:45] hope don't give up hope because Jesus
[1:28:49] said blessed are they that do hunger and

[1:35:38] that that that person owns what they
[1:35:41] are they own what they are and and I

[1:36:08] what do you remember you you remember
[1:36:09] seeing that little peculiar Stars it
[1:36:11] begins to lead us there's something

[1:36:36] was about to go on they they begin to
[1:36:39] pull on him said no don't don't you
[1:36:40] leave me don't you leave me about some
[1:36:41] third pole Ministry I I really I really
[1:36:43] need some of these things and and they
[1:36:45] were they started looking at him and
[1:36:47] they they started looking at how he talk
[1:36:48] them through the scriptures and how
[1:36:50] their heart was burning how they were
[1:36:51] looking at the different attributes of
[1:36:53] how was talking to him and brother
[1:36:55] brandham said that when he broke the

[1:37:00] that was belonging to himself that they
[1:37:02] recognize that belonged to him they
[1:37:05] recognize that that that would that

[1:37:09] that that kind of action that kind of
[1:37:11] word belonged to one and only person the
[1:37:14] Messiah now I love when you start
[1:37:16] studying out the book of Peter that the
[1:37:18] Bible said that you are a chosen
[1:37:20] generation A peculiar people
[1:37:24] peculiar also means you belong and
