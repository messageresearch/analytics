[57:01] 26 and in the sixth month the angel
[57:03] Gabriel was sent from God into the city
[57:06] of Galilee named nazarus to a virgin ESP
[57:10] spoused to a man whose name was Joseph
[57:13] of the House of David and the virgin's
[57:15] name was Mary and the angel came in and
[57:19] unto her and said hail Thou Art highly
[57:22] favored and the Lord is with thee
[57:25] blessed art thou of among women and when
[57:27] she saw him she was troubled at his
[57:29] saying and cast in her mind what matter
[57:32] of salutation this should be and the
[57:35] angel said unto her fear not Mary for
[57:39] thou has found favor with God and behold
[57:42] Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and
[57:44] bring forth a son and shall call his
[57:46] name Jesus and he shall be called great
[57:49] and shall be called the son of the
[57:52] highest and the Lord God shall give unto
[57:54] him the throne of his father
[57:57] David and he shall reign over the house
[58:00] of Jacob forever and of his kingdom
[58:03] there shall be no
[58:04] end and then Mary said unto the angel
[58:08] how shall this be seeing I know not a
[58:10] man and the angel answered and said unto
[58:13] her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee
[58:17] and the power of the highest shall
[58:19] overshadow thee therefore also that Holy
[58:22] thing which shall be born of thee shall
[58:25] be called the Son of God may the Lord
[58:28] bless the reading of his word you can be
[58:39] seated in Luke Chapter 2 and verse verse
[58:43] 8 and there were in the same
[58:46] country shepherds abiding in the
[58:49] field keeping the watch of their flock
[58:53] by night and lo the angel of the Lord
[58:55] came upon them and and the glory of the
[58:58] Lord Shone round about them and they
[59:00] were sore
[59:01] afraid and the angel said unto them fear
[59:04] not for behold I bring to you good
[59:08] tidings of great joy which shall be to
[59:11] all people for unto you born this day in
[59:15] the city of David a savior which is
[59:18] Christ the
[59:19] lord and this shall be a sign unto you
[59:22] that ye shall find him the Babe wrapped
[59:25] in SW botling clothes and lying in a
[59:28] manger and suddenly there was with the
[59:31] angel a multitude of heavenly hosts
[59:33] praising God and saying glory to God in
[59:36] the highest and on the earth peace and
[59:38] Good Will toward men and it came to pass
[59:41] as the Angels were gone away from them
[59:45] into the heavens the Shepherds said unto
[59:48] another let us go now even to the unto
[59:52] Bethlehem and see this thing which has
[59:55] come to pass which the Lord hath known
[59:57] unto has made known unto us and they
[1:00:01] came with haste and found Mary and
[1:00:03] Joseph and in the Babe lying in a manger
[1:00:07] and when they had seen it they made
[1:00:09] known abroad and say which was told
[1:00:13] concerning this
[1:00:15] child and all that they heard of it
[1:00:18] wondered at those things which were told
[1:00:21] by them the Shepherds but Mary kept all
[1:00:24] of these things and pondered them in her
[1:00:27] heart and the Shepherds returned
[1:00:30] glorifying and praising God for all
[1:00:32] things which they had heard and seen and
[1:00:36] it was told unto
[1:00:38] them amen I'd like to speak to you just
[1:00:41] for a little bit
[1:00:43] on by the birth of one
[1:00:47] Amen in the Garden of
[1:00:51] Eden the there was a Jesus or God spoke
[1:00:56] these words and said I will put enmity
[1:01:00] between
[1:01:01] thee and the
[1:01:05] woman and between thy seed and her
[1:01:10] seed and it shall bruise thy he thy head
[1:01:14] and thou shalt bruise his
[1:01:18] heel I want you to remember this is
[1:01:20] God's making a promise in the Garden of
[1:01:22] Eden I will restore amen
[1:01:27] I will
[1:01:28] restore I will make this
[1:01:31] right Thank You Lord the first
[1:01:34] Adam as he was there and he came to his
[1:01:37] wife and found her in that condition
[1:01:41] knew that if God saw her in this
[1:01:44] condition that he would kill
[1:01:47] her he would take her and Destroy
[1:01:52] her and Adam had a choice to make right
[1:01:56] do I let her
[1:01:59] die or do I take myself and place my
[1:02:03] seed on the inside of
[1:02:06] her and God won't destroy his own seed
[1:02:10] right so he made a choice brother
[1:02:13] Brandon would use this statement and
[1:02:14] forgive me for not having it in front of
[1:02:16] it he did it with his eyes wide
[1:02:20] open Eve was deceived but Adam was not
[1:02:24] deceived
[1:02:26] and he was acting out what God had
[1:02:28] placed on the inside of him of
[1:02:32] redemption but this act as God comes and
[1:02:36] comes through the garden and they can
[1:02:38] hear him coming through the garden and
[1:02:39] he's screaming Adam Where Art Thou God
[1:02:44] knew where they was
[1:02:45] at where art thou and listen God didn't
[1:02:50] send an angel to go find
[1:02:52] them he didn't send a a great individual
[1:02:55] of Heaven to go find them God came
[1:02:58] himself I want you to understand that's
[1:03:01] important even for this service
[1:03:03] today God comes to you amen
[1:03:07] himself and you are so
[1:03:11] important he won't leave it up to
[1:03:15] another he comes himself to
[1:03:18] you every one of our new births are a
[1:03:22] little bit different some of us met God
[1:03:25] in a car some of us met God at service
[1:03:27] some of us sat in our Pew and God came
[1:03:30] to us some of us walked to the Altar and
[1:03:33] received a real experience with God but
[1:03:36] as long as you meet him you will never
[1:03:39] be the
[1:03:42] same Adam's fall no doubt as Adam lives
[1:03:47] over 900 years Adam lived long enough to
[1:03:52] be able to see the destruction
[1:03:56] of the fall of Eve the fall of the
[1:03:59] garden Adam lived long enough to watch
[1:04:02] nature fall amen where Adam was he never
[1:04:07] saw a dead leaf withered
[1:04:10] grass flower petals falling it was a
[1:04:14] perfect
[1:04:15] Eden but when Adam fell listen he was he
[1:04:19] was an amateur God on the Earth but when
[1:04:22] Adam fell and transgressed remember God
[1:04:25] told him said the day that you eat
[1:04:28] thereof that day you
[1:04:31] die they didn't know what death
[1:04:34] was death be to set in Adam was now
[1:04:39] beginning to get stoop
[1:04:41] shouldered gray hair he was beginning to
[1:04:45] get wrinkles on his body he was now
[1:04:48] working by the sweat of his brow he was
[1:04:51] not speaking the words of like God could
[1:04:54] speak but now he was working with his
[1:04:59] hands now he was understanding what
[1:05:02] death was all about he was seeing his
[1:05:05] children fight and fuss seeing one be
[1:05:12] killed murder happened in his family
[1:05:15] almost
[1:05:16] immediately let me just say this to Adam
[1:05:19] as he lives he has to relive the fall
[1:05:23] over and over again amen
[1:05:26] let me just say by that act every dead
[1:05:29] baby
[1:05:31] right every
[1:05:34] war every fight over
[1:05:38] boundaries was Now set against the
[1:05:40] Garden of
[1:05:42] Eden but God made a
[1:05:46] promise God made a
[1:05:48] promise I will
[1:05:51] restore I'll bring you back to the
[1:05:53] Garden I'll bring you back I will make a
[1:05:57] way listen he was making a testimony
[1:06:01] when he called them back as they were
[1:06:03] leav in the garden and he took sheep and
[1:06:07] took the skins off of those sheep and
[1:06:09] they gave their life and he wrapped
[1:06:11] those bloody skins around
[1:06:14] them because no man no matter how great
[1:06:18] he is can't pay for his own
[1:06:22] sin Kings potentates ambassadors
[1:06:26] smartest people of the world greatest
[1:06:28] gifted cannot pay for your own
[1:06:31] sins doctors loyers no matter what your
[1:06:34] profession is you can't pay for your own
[1:06:37] sins Rich poor you can't pay for your
[1:06:41] own sins greatest men in the world would
[1:06:44] come to live like
[1:06:47] David but because of the Fall he would
[1:06:50] become a murderer
[1:06:52] right are you with me Solomon would
[1:06:55] marry many wives and go into different
[1:06:58] types of of of even other kinds of
[1:07:01] worship and build other Tabernacles even
[1:07:04] besides the Tabernacle of God every one
[1:07:07] of these prophets had
[1:07:10] flaws right that's right are you with me
[1:07:13] Joseph had a flaw Abraham had a flaw
[1:07:17] Isaac had a flaw Jacob definitely had a
[1:07:20] fallaw listen all of these people had
[1:07:23] flaws in their life but it was a
[1:07:26] testimony that we needed a
[1:07:30] redeemer it was a
[1:07:34] testimony now let me just share this
[1:07:36] with you before I go any further David
[1:07:39] no doubt worshiped in the anointing and
[1:07:43] the praise of
[1:07:44] God but he knew within himself he needed
[1:07:49] more that's right listen most listen all
[1:07:53] of us Le even today need more of
[1:07:59] him we all need more of him that's our
[1:08:03] desire evening today I need
[1:08:09] more why do we need to assemble
[1:08:11] ourselves in the house of God I don't I
[1:08:14] don't care how long you've served the
[1:08:16] Lord but every one of us need that touch
[1:08:19] from him and listen there's no touch
[1:08:21] like he can give to your life
[1:08:29] I kind of want to bring this kind of an
[1:08:31] odd sort of way
[1:08:35] cuz when he come to me the other morning
[1:08:39] and begin to deal with me I
[1:08:41] thought I've never quite looked at it
[1:08:44] quite like
[1:08:49] this Lucifer was responsible for the
[1:08:53] fall
[1:08:56] let's place the blame where it has to
[1:08:58] be the fallen angel from
[1:09:02] heaven causes all of our
[1:09:06] problems but he was responsible for the
[1:09:12] fall God makes a
[1:09:16] covenant Lucifer being there that old
[1:09:20] serpent being there when God says I will
[1:09:23] put enmity between the seat and God
[1:09:28] literally tells him I'm going to crush
[1:09:35] you I'm going to crush
[1:09:39] you now listen you know people say well
[1:09:42] I don't I don't believe in the serpent
[1:09:44] seed that one scripture ought to prove
[1:09:47] it to
[1:09:49] you by a a that seed they
[1:09:52] fell but by that seed we're
[1:10:04] redeemed no doubt oh sloot himself
[1:10:09] Lucifer watched through the generations
[1:10:12] of Time for That seed to be
[1:10:17] born listen No Doubt all the prophets
[1:10:20] were laying out that he's coming and
[1:10:23] there was an attribute inside side of
[1:10:25] himself of this Messiah that was coming
[1:10:28] small part of God himself imparted in
[1:10:32] every prophet in every
[1:10:36] believer and Lucifer was
[1:10:38] watching because he not only can see in
[1:10:41] this realm but he can see in the spirit
[1:10:44] realm no doubt he could see
[1:10:47] Moses at the burning bush and Lucifer
[1:10:51] knew that was
[1:10:53] God he knew that was God no doubt with
[1:10:57] Ezekiel he could see with a the the
[1:11:00] wheel within the middle of the
[1:11:02] wheel he knew that was
[1:11:05] God no doubt when Isaiah is standing and
[1:11:09] screaming Behold a virgin shall
[1:11:14] conceive are you with me now Lucifer
[1:11:17] could go back and look at what he was
[1:11:19] told in the Garden of Eden so now he's
[1:11:22] watching for a virgin to conceive listen
[1:11:26] it's totally impossible for that to
[1:11:28] happen but With God all things are
[1:11:34] [Applause]
[1:11:36] possible and why would it be so
[1:11:38] important that she would be a
[1:11:41] virgin it's CZ he was paying for the sin
[1:11:44] in the
[1:11:46] garden and this would not be part Mar
[1:11:49] and part God it's going to be all God
[1:11:56] [Applause]
[1:12:04] Mary gets a
[1:12:08] visit no doubt in my
[1:12:11] mind not only did
[1:12:13] Mary see this
[1:12:16] happening but no doubt Lucifer was
[1:12:20] watching cuz he can see in that
[1:12:23] realm and he's
[1:12:26] watching now he's got
[1:12:31] trouble now he's got real
[1:12:34] trouble because when this child's born
[1:12:37] it's going to change the whole human
[1:12:40] race it's no longer be under under the
[1:12:43] Reigns of death and horror like job
[1:12:47] talked
[1:12:48] about but after this baby is
[1:12:53] born after this baby is born it's going
[1:12:57] to change
[1:13:01] humankind are you with me
[1:13:05] now in 1 Corinthians chapter 15 verse
[1:13:10] 21 for Since By Man Came Death and by
[1:13:15] man came also the resurrection of the
[1:13:17] Dead for for as in Adam all
[1:13:23] die even so in Christ shall all be made
[1:13:28] Alive Now notice it was saying just a
[1:13:30] moment ago in Revelations CH 5 and verse
[1:13:33] one to the Bride of Jesus Christ is very
[1:13:35] familiar scripture and I saw in the
[1:13:37] right hand of him that sat on the throne
[1:13:39] a book written and within and on the
[1:13:42] backside seal with Seven
[1:13:43] Seals and I saw a strange Angel a strong
[1:13:47] angel proclaiming with a loud
[1:13:51] voice who is Worthy
[1:13:55] let's ask the question who is worthy to
[1:13:59] open the book and to look there on
[1:14:01] listen our names was in the
[1:14:06] book where they're predestinated listen
[1:14:10] that's what's
[1:14:11] important not that you see brother
[1:14:13] brandom's name in the book or or some
[1:14:15] great figure in the book you got to see
[1:14:17] your
[1:14:18] name and listen the devil will shake you
[1:14:21] every which way in the world until you
[1:14:24] see your name in the book and it becomes
[1:14:27] real to
[1:14:29] you then it'll be a fight no more then
[1:14:33] you'll realize I'm as Eternal as he is
[1:14:35] eternal I came from God and I'm going to
[1:14:38] go back to
[1:14:45] God
[1:14:50] hallelujah I've just described to you
[1:14:52] the
[1:14:53] flaw Moses couldn't redeem the book he
[1:14:57] had a
[1:14:57] flaw David couldn't redeem the book he
[1:15:01] had a
[1:15:02] flaw all the prophets could not redeem
[1:15:05] the book they had a
[1:15:07] flaw what about Elijah he took a Rapture
[1:15:10] but he had flaws right right are you
[1:15:13] with me he was moody
[1:15:19] right we have
[1:15:23] floss we have
[1:15:26] flws and John realized if there's nobody
[1:15:31] worthy if there's nobody worthy to come
[1:15:34] and take the book we're
[1:15:37] lost and if we're lost life is not worth
[1:15:42] living we'll live and die like a dog
[1:15:56] Gabriel couldn't step
[1:15:58] forth the Angels couldn't step
[1:16:02] forth but God answered his own
[1:16:06] Covenant I'll go
[1:16:09] myself now listen I I want you to think
[1:16:12] about this God didn't come as a
[1:16:17] king he didn't come as a great
[1:16:20] leader cuz Satan would have saw it real
[1:16:23] quick
[1:16:25] God hides himself as a
[1:16:32] baby are you with me he hides himself as
[1:16:36] a
[1:16:37] baby sure we know all the supernatural
[1:16:40] events that are around that from the
[1:16:42] angel
[1:16:43] meeting but
[1:16:45] immediately Satan goes to work to
[1:16:48] destroy the
[1:16:50] seat that's what he'll do to you you was
[1:16:53] enjoying parties you was enjoying life
[1:16:56] you was enjoying listen it just seemed
[1:16:58] like life was a breeze and then God
[1:17:01] ignited something on the inside of you
[1:17:03] that was in you before the foundation of
[1:17:05] the world and immediately Satan gets all
[1:17:09] [Applause]
[1:17:10] upset immediately he starts Waring with
[1:17:13] you and it's like you're you're
[1:17:16] struggling against the
[1:17:18] water because at one time you were
[1:17:21] flowing with the stream but now you've
[1:17:23] turned around
[1:17:30] brother Ron I'm having trouble you're
[1:17:32] supposed to but he will come on the
[1:17:35] inside of you and help you overcome you
[1:17:38] will never be
[1:17:42] alone never never never you'll never be
[1:17:45] alone
[1:17:58] even in that
[1:18:01] day governments was
[1:18:06] involved they placed a
[1:18:10] taxation now I want you to understand as
[1:18:12] I spoke to you guys in
[1:18:16] Ohio
[1:18:19] God needed Joseph to go to Bethlehem
[1:18:25] us men are
[1:18:27] happy with no
[1:18:33] change it's human
[1:18:36] nature we don't want our toothbrush
[1:18:39] moved we sleep on a certain side of the
[1:18:42] bed we use the same pillow for 42
[1:18:51] years Joseph gets news that you you've
[1:18:55] got to go pay your taxes and you can't
[1:18:58] do it
[1:19:00] here you got to go to
[1:19:03] Bethleham are you with me listen to
[1:19:06] brother brandham as Joseph as he
[1:19:08] describes Joseph taking his 9month
[1:19:12] pregnant
[1:19:14] wife on a donkey all of this journey and
[1:19:19] he said he complained the whole time
[1:19:25] and every bit of it was the will of
[1:19:29] God God forces
[1:19:33] change God has a listen this baby cannot
[1:19:37] be born anywhere else but
[1:19:40] here and it was not an accident there
[1:19:43] was no
[1:19:44] room in the church
[1:19:47] world he had to be born in a manger or a
[1:19:51] barn
[1:19:52] [Applause]
[1:19:55] and God arranges it that Shepherds think
[1:20:00] about it listen to I'm I'm I'm putting a
[1:20:02] lot of sermons together now brother br's
[1:20:04] the greatest Christmas sermon preacher
[1:20:06] that there is listen God arranges it not
[1:20:10] to go to Kings to come visit him in a
[1:20:14] Manger Kings will come two years later
[1:20:18] but God arranges it that
[1:20:21] shepherds abiding on the field watching
[1:20:24] over their
[1:20:25] block Calla Shepherds who has the smell
[1:20:29] of sheep on
[1:20:30] [Applause]
[1:20:32] them they have the smell of sheep they
[1:20:35] understand the nature of sheep they'll
[1:20:37] be comfortable in this
[1:20:43] Barn there's a lot of people that will
[1:20:45] go to church on
[1:20:48] Christmas or

[1:21:07] Easter now I want you to just
[1:21:13] notice I'm sure it was
[1:21:17] heart-wrenching to put your wife in a
[1:21:21] barn and knowing that baby's coming
[1:21:25] Their
[1:21:26] Stars the Bible of the
[1:21:29] heavens has come together and the
[1:21:33] Messiah sign is
[1:21:36] shining three major stars have come
[1:21:39] together to announce in heaven that that

[1:22:27] churches that he went to that was
[1:22:29] Pentecostal or Full Gospel that he
[1:22:31] preached to there was no churches a
[1:22:33] symbol like this but the the message
[1:22:36] would be
[1:22:37] preached men would grab the message and
[1:22:40] begin to deliver the word because this
[1:22:43] had to be born on the inside of
[1:22:46] you this was not just for brick and
[1:22:49] mortar and stone and walls this message
[1:22:52] had to live in human vessels in the
[1:22:55] manger of your
[1:22:57] [Applause]
[1:23:00] heart God's not satisfied with libraries
[1:23:03] with a name on it hospitals with a name

[1:25:30] earth a
[1:25:33] baby is

[1:30:33] God let your servant depart in
[1:30:37] peace according to your word for my eyes
[1:30:43] has seen the
[1:30:46] salvation and way back over in the
[1:30:48] corner an old blind woman named
[1:30:50] Anna she was a prophetess
[1:30:54] Anna was a prophetess and she had been
[1:30:56] blind for years and she sat there and
[1:30:59] she has always waited and believed on
[1:31:03] the consolation of Israel she believed
[1:31:06] that that Prophet was coming and she was
[1:31:09] believing and she was sitting there and
[1:31:11] the Holy Ghost said Anna stand
[1:31:16] up those that are spiritual are always
[1:31:19] LED you know at the right time stand up
[1:31:22] Anna and here comes that old blind woman
[1:31:26] pardon me sir pardon me pardon me Madam
[1:31:30] I'm sorry led by the Holy Ghost where
[1:31:33] are you going Anna I don't know I'm just
[1:31:36] being led and the first thing you know
[1:31:39] she comes right straight to where Simeon
[1:31:42] is standing and saying Lord let thy
[1:31:45] servant depart in peace and she likewise
[1:31:50] the Holy Ghost Came Upon her and she
[1:31:52] began to prophesy about the chur
[1:31:54] oh brother or sister if the Holy Ghost
[1:31:57] could lead a blind woman in those those
[1:31:59] kind of times how much more could he
[1:32:01] lead us
[1:32:03] today although we are becoming blind let
[1:32:06] the HIM lead us back to the Fountain I
[1:32:09] love this part there is a fountain
[1:32:12] filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's
[1:32:15] veins where Sinners plunged beneath the
[1:32:20] flood lose all their guilt
[1:32:30] STS when the first news came to
[1:32:34] Glory that the son had been lost
[1:32:38] Adam did God send an
[1:32:42] angel did he send a
[1:32:44] son did he send someone
[1:32:47] else he came himself
[1:32:52] Amen to redeem his lost son God didn't
[1:32:57] trust it with no one but himself God was
[1:33:01] made flesh and dwelt Among Us and
[1:33:03] redeemed man we are saved the Bible said
[1:33:08] by the blood of
[1:33:11] God you talking about a Christmas
[1:33:19] gift you're talking about a Christmas
[1:33:22] gift it's greater than than a sweater
[1:33:24] that you probably can't can't wear in
[1:33:27] two
[1:33:31] years are you with me it's greater than
[1:33:33] a gun it's greater than a
[1:33:36] ball this Christmas gift is
[1:33:39] eternal
[1:33:41] that's the immortal God was made Mortal
[1:33:45] in order to take away sin to be the lamb
[1:33:49] himself to enter into Glory veiled with
[1:33:54] his own blood before
[1:33:56] him Beyond the
[1:33:59] Veil Harvest time he said like he did in
[1:34:02] the second Adam after Adam fell he began
[1:34:05] to raise a second Adam and the second
[1:34:08] Adam fell then it was taken up the first

[1:44:44] moment ago down from his
[1:44:46] glory ever living
[1:44:49] story my God and savior
[1:44:54] came and Jesus was his
[1:44:58] name born in a
[1:45:01] manger oh my
[1:45:04] God God didn't need a pink hospital room
[1:45:06] to be born in a manger suited him very
[1:45:11] well
[1:45:13] because he was a
[1:45:16] lamb the
[1:45:18] Lamb of God
[1:45:24] one more
[1:45:30] thought Adam watched
[1:45:34] Abel tie of
[1:45:38] Vine around the
[1:45:44] lamb Cain had a beautiful
[1:45:47] Altar and he built it by all his
[1:45:50] works but it didn't work that's right
[1:45:54] come on but Abel took a
[1:45:56] Vine and put it around that
[1:45:59] lamb and pulled it to a
[1:46:04] rock and put it up on that rock and
[1:46:07] begin to take a sharp
[1:46:09] Stone and offer it to God Amen listen
[1:46:15] without because of children here let me
[1:46:17] just
[1:46:18] say that lamb
[1:46:21] died for Abel
[1:46:25] and then after God received his offering
[1:46:29] the jealousy of his brother
[1:46:34] right because of who his father was
[1:46:38] right caused him to die on the same
[1:46:43] Rock for all of that this baby has to be
[1:46:47] born right to revoke the jurisdiction of
[1:46:53] Satan
[1:46:55] amen because there was a lot of things
