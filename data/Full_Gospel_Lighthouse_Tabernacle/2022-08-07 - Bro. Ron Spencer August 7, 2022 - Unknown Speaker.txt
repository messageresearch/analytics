to see you god bless you give him a great big hand we've been buddies a long long time and uh amen he's been a i've been a fan of his a long time but he's singing about my jesus and that gets me excited amen that gets me excited so goodness each and every one of you thank you for your prayers and thank you for praying for us as we we was away at meetings and god richly blessed us and those that were in north carolina i know you were blessed there and got a little drunk on friday night and so here we are amen had a hangover for a little bit so amen you love the lord any good to us amen turn with me to luke chapter 19 and verse 37. luke chapter 19 and verse 37. we might be here for a little while also don't get too impatient with me and when he was come nigh even now at the descent of the mount of olives the whole multitude of the disciples begin to rejoice and praise god with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen saying blessed be the king that cometh in the name of the lord peace in heaven glory in the highest some of the pharisees among whom the multitude said unto him master rebuke thy disciples that spirit's not dead and he answered and said unto them i tell you that if these should hold their peace the stones would immediately cry out hallelujah let's pray lord jesus we love you this morning thank you for the service last night what a powerful service that took place here i ask you that you would anoint our lips and anoint our hearts in a special way today and lord we need strength from you lord and you're the strength giver i just pray that you would do a supernatural work for us today in jesus christ's name we pray amen and amen you can be seated the scripture says in mark chapter 16 and verse 15 and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature and he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned these signs shall follow them that believe we're believers aren't we in my name shall they cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them and they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover we are commissioned to be a church in action we're not clubs and we're not just a group of a clique or a cult we're a church in action let me just say this to you this won't offend believe us children of god but it does offend the devil the scripture in in psalms chapter 100 of verse 4 enter into his gates with thanksgiving and into his courts with praise and be thankful unto him and bless his name if there's anybody that we ought to be thankful to and that's our god brother brown said the people said you make too much noise he said this is the quietest place that you will ever live in if you go to heaven even the angels are singing day and night holy holy unto the lord and if you go to hell it's weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth this is the quietest place that you'll ever live in nicolaitan he said and what did the nicolaitans asked for it asked to get people away from a bunch of people that shouts claps their hands looks like it's disgracefully like they did at pentecost act like drunk men staggering in the spirit they didn't want none of that stuff they said they were drunk and when that when the celebrity he said listen don't miss this it's it may sound crazy to you but it's the truth when the dignitaries begin to come in they didn't want to stoop to that amen man a man spoke to brother branham said i was enjoying your son billy i was enjoying your sermon until that woman raised up and started crying said how in the world could you preach and her acting like that i said that's the only time i can preach [Applause] when i see that power of god is caught away in the church and caught away with the message he said it just made shivers go all over my back i want you to just listen to our prophet's response if you'd ever be fortunate enough to get to heaven you'd freeze to death because they're crying and shouting and praising god day and night angels flying back and forth crying holy holy unto the lord now let me just tell you something right now my brother you're living in the quietest world that you'll ever live in if you go to hell there'll be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth in revelation chapter 19 and verse 1 and after these things i heard a great voice of much people in heaven saying hallelujah salvation and glory and honor and power into the lord our god for true and righteous are his judgments for he hath judged the great which did corrupt the earth with her fornication hath and avenged our blood of the servants at her hand that's enough to shout at right there and again they said hallelujah and her smoke rose up forever and ever and the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and worshiped god that sat on the throne saying amen hallelujah and the voice came out of the throne saying praise our god all ye his servants ye that fear him both small and great and i heard as if it was a voice of a great multitude has a voice of many waters a voice of mighty thundering saying hallelujah for the lord god omnipotent reigneth let us be glad and rejoice let us be glad to rejoice and give honor to the man to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready now listen we could read about jonah and rejoice we're going to read about abraham and rejoice but we're reading about ourselves right here we are his wife and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints and he which and and he saith unto me right blessed earth they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb and he said unto me these are the true sayings of god why should we be so excited as i spoke on friday night in north carolina we are unashamed of worship [Applause] listen let me just say never let your worship bring shame be ashamed to worship god u.s and ashamed to worship the cowboys or the redskins or the yankees or dale earnhardt i'll find you or elvis presley you wasn't ashamed to worship some humanity don't let the devil put you in a corner for where you're ashamed to worship god luke 10 and verse 17 and the seventy returned again with joy saying lord even the devils are subject unto us through thy name and he said unto them i beheld satan as us lightning fall from heaven behold i give you power to tread upon serpents and scorpions and over the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you and that prescription is still alive for us put the devil that you're fighting under your feet he wants to boast and rile with you put him where he needs to be under your feet [Applause] walk on him stomp on him notwithstanding in this rejoice not that the subjects are subject unto you but rather rejoice boy this is powerful but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven let me just say this you if you were eternal there you always will be eternal if god thought of you before the foundation of the world there's not a devil in hell that can take you from that position i don't care what trial i don't care what temptation i don't care what difficulty that you'll have to go through in life god's got a host of you and he will not lose one it's not you holding on to him it's not you going from one revival to another revival and it's all based on your feelings it's not you gotta hold to him he's gotta hope to you [Applause] in that hour jesus rejoiced in the spirit i've always thought that was such a powerful scripture it's not written anywhere else jesus was more than just had a little hand up evidently he had himself an old-fashioned holy ghost breakdown because he knew who he was and he knew what he was getting ready to accomplish and there wasn't one name that was written in the lamb's book of life that was going to be lost and he knew that there was not a devil in hell that could defeat him and when he would breathe his last breath he would pay the price but he could say you can lay this life down and in three days i'll take it up again no man ever speak like this man he knew who he was he came from god and he's going back to god no wonder he can shout we're his children no wonder we can shout psalms 24 lift up all your dates hold your gates o-b-u-b-b you lift up ye everlasting doors and the king of glory not 15 kings the king of glory our king brother jean the king of glory shall come in who is the king of glory the lord strong and mighty the lord mighty in battle lift up your heads all your gates lift him up he everlasting doors and the king of glory shall come in who is the king of glory the lord of hosts he is the king of glory and jesus answered to pilate my kingdom is not of this world this is a powerful statement he got to call one angel he gonna call one angel to change the whole scene do you realize when isaiah saw him the the seraph and screaming holy holy holy holy even the scripture said the voice of one shakes the throne an earthquake could take place with one serpent shaking could have changed the whole scene but in his silence saying i'm not the king of this world and my kingdom is not of this world it held them at bay [Music] hallelujah it held them at bay but he knew you was coming he conquered sickness he conquered temptation and when the enemy spit in his face and smote his jaw and he turned it the other side they jerked the beard out of his face and they spit on him he never revolved back he conquered the gate of temptation yes then you say my temper won't let me do it you seed of abraham he conquered it for you when he reviled when he was reviled upon he revolved not back when he was made fun of he held his peace imagine the power that was upon display that power's just not in heaven it's in you you take it to school you take it to work you live with it home it's on the inside of you the scripture says in john chapter 1 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and was god the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was not anything dismayed that was made in him was life and the light was life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and darkness comprehendeth it not right verse 10 he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came to his own and his own received him not but as many as received him oh why don't you just shout right now hallelujah while your friends turned him down something ignited on the inside of you [Music] but as many as received him to them he gave power to become the sons of god even to the them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor the will of flesh nor the will of man but of god your new birth did not come by some persuasion of some preacher your new birth came by god he knew where he was at he knew the situation you was in he knew the trouble that you was going to go through in your life and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as the only begotten of father full of grace and truth and when jesus was standing in mar in matthew 16 and when jesus came to the coast of caesarea philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that are the son of man am and they said some say thou art john the baptist some elias others jeremiahs are one of the prophets and he saith unto them but who say ye that i am and jesus answered and said unto them and simon peter answered and said thou art the christ the son of the living god and jesus answered and said it in blessed earth thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven this is more than a scripture 2 000 years ago sometimes we miss what god's doing now miss what god's doing now brother brown would go into a city and churches all over would boycott the meeting tell their people not to go to the meeting because god was doing something he was doing something and he would tell their people not to go to the meeting but yet they'd go theirself are you with me don't worry god will have a pride don't worry they boycotted the media but yet god sowed the sink he knew this church would come he knew that you were on the way why are you with me my brother just shared as brother branham flew across ghana and he and he wanted to land there he said but there's many people there and he just showed a church that he that he went to when he was in god has about 10 000 people in it let me just say this you god's got a people don't you worry about whether god's going to have a bride he's going to have a pride people say well i don't know i'm just going to go back let me just say it don't matter if you ain't seed you can't hold yourself but if you are seed there's nothing that you can do to take yourself back [Applause] boy you ought to rejoice over that one matthew chapter 28 and verse 19 do you therefore teach all nations baptized in the name of the father and of the son of the holy ghost isaiah 9 6 for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful is that his name counselor is that his name the mighty god is that his name the everlasting father is that his name the prince of peace is that his name none of those titles is his name [Applause] he's the great advocate he is the almighty he is alpha and omega he is the final amen he is the angel of the present he is the arm of the lord he is the author and the finisher of our faith he is the beginning of the creation of god he is the beloved he is our bridegroom he is the bright and morning star he is the brightness of the father's glory he is the captain of the lord's host he is the chief cornerstone he is the chiefest of ten thousands he is jesus christ our lord he is the commander he is the consolation of israel he is the chief cornerstone he is david his day star his day spring he is the desire of the nations he is the door of doors he is emmanuel he is the inside he is the eternal life he is emmanuel he is the faithful and the true all of these are titles but it's all encapsulated in the name of the lord jesus christ yeah i'm struggling to preach but it's a truth anyway don't worry about me worry about you if you miss it i've done come to the conclusion that satan can't take my life he would have done it a long time ago brother tim as i was sitting listening to you sing last night it inspired me so i went and got these words didn't i walk on the water and i calmed the rage and see i'll tell you what in my weakened body i feel like i'm feeling right now standing in this pulpit as you were singing over there last night i don't know this i don't know what this audience felt but i know what i felt then and i know what i felt now didn't i walk on the water and i calmed the raging sea i spoke to the wind and it hust and i gave you peace didn't i run to your rescue didn't i hear when you called i walk right beside you just so you wouldn't fall didn't i leave all of heaven just to die for your sin i searched until i found you and i'll do it all again why don't we just rejoice thank you i won't be much longer now that'd be okay let me okay who is jesus that we should worship him like we do who is jesus he's more than just some dead church he's more than some picture on a wall he's more than just somebody that we call to when we get in trouble everybody could scream when cancer's tearing their backs and i'm not i don't have one person in mind destroying their life or they're in the car wreck and their car's flipping or or or if they're in a bankrupt situation and there's no way out there's even heathen screamed for jesus in the time of trouble but this jesus wants to be more than your rescuer he came from the bosom of the father to the bosom of a woman he put on humanity that we could put on divinity he became the son of god that we might become sons of god he came from heaven where rivers never freeze winds never blow frost never chills the air flowers never fade and no one is ever sick there's no undertakers there's no graveyards hallelujah no one ever dies and no one is ever buried he was born contrary to the laws of nature he lived in obscurity and poverty he crossed the boundary of land once in his childhood he had no wealth and nor influence he neither had training or any formal education his relatives were inconspicuous and wasn't influential in infancy he startled kings and boyhood he puzzled the wisest of men in manhood he ruled the course of nature he walked on billows and he hushed the seed to sleep he healed multitudes without medicine and made no charge for his services he never wrote a book yet all the libraries of the country could not hold the books that have been written about him never wrote a song yet all it has furnished the theme of more songs than all the songwriters combined he never founded a college yet all the schools together cannot boast of as many students as he has he never practiced psychiatry yet he has healed more broken hearts than doctors have healed broken bodies he never merced an army or drafted a soldier or fired a gun yet no leader has more volunteers who have under his orders made rebels stack arms and surrender without firing a shot he is a star of astronomy he is the rock of geology he is the lion and the lamb of zoology he is a harmonizer of all discords he is the healer of all diseases great men have come and gone yet he he lives herod could not kill him satan could not seduce him death could not destroy him and the grave could not hold him nobody can it be said of that paragraph right there not a man from abraham to william branham there's none like jesus and i want to say this you jesus will never be one of the boys are you with me he's going to be king of kings and lord of the lords we respond we we incredibly respect all the prophets but there's none like our lord [Applause] he laid aside the purple robe for a passage gown he was rich but for our sakes he became poor right wise men and he slept in another man's manger he cruised ships in another lance boat he rode on another man's donkey he was buried in another man's tomb everyone else has failed but he never never failed you've heard me read this before but i've come to this point the devil would have been standing there if he would have had an evil thought because our thoughts sound louder in heaven than they do on earth and that perfect sacrifice that was tempted by women tempted by popularity tempted by the kingdoms of this world and even being tempted to take it could be found innocent and you no doubt have thought evil thoughts already this morning amen don't sit with the angel wings i thought evil thoughts again this morning you needed jesus [Music] you needed jesus i want to say this to you i needed jesus i couldn't stand here without him today [Applause] i thank god for great doctors that have helped to prolong my life but they can't heal me but i'm preaching about one that can if they went in one side to remove one of the tumors it would cause me not to be able to walk on one side if they went into the other side to get the other tumor it would cause me not to have cognitive abilities and i wouldn't be able to talk but since jesus is in charge i'll just leave it in the hands of jesus and tell the devil he can't touch a hair of my body until god's done with me what about you this morning what about you trust this kind of jesus that was him when he created the heavens and earth when he said let there be and he believed his own word that was him when the sun was spoken into existence and it was absolutely a perfect degree of temperature so that this earth that we stand on could have winter spring summer and fall man wants to talk about heating you know this climate change this earth is going to have a climate change it's going to i want to say this to you i'm a believer in climate change i'm not a democrat by no stretch of anybody's imaginations but i am a believer in climate change in a few days this baby's gonna burn it's gonna burn so don't plan to stay it's gonna burn she gonna burn and if you don't believe me watch the next time it rains little rain or a flood there comes a rainbow and it's not for that bunch of gay homosexuals out there that's our covenant [Applause] that was him in a cradle that was god as a baby in a cradle and god had shepherds to come and kings to come it shocked the nations that a king had come as a baby and to which it even spent an abortion rate throughout all of the land and they killed the babies and they killed the babies in egypt thinking there was a prophet there and they killed it when jesus was there that's what they're doing now because our king is coming but you can't destroy god's seed there's him in the cradle that's him when he controls your disasters that's him when he walks into your hospital room that's him when he goes and takes your difficulties that's him when he takes your disease and tells the devil he can't go no more that was god when he healed the blind that was god when he healed the lame that's god when he healed the cripples no disease could stand in the way of jesus that was god when he raised lazarus from the tomb that was god when he raised jerry's daughter up that was god when he screamed lazarus come forth and all of the other dead had to hold their place but lazarus could scream i heard my savior callin and they he told them take the grave clothes off he don't need him no more loose him and let him go oh if we could just hear that today you may be dead in your sins loose him and let him go take off your sinful nature amen that was him on the cross but he's not there no more so many religions and even churches will want to take you back to the cross but it's empty today that cross is empty it had an enzyme and it was extremely important but he's not hanging on a cross no more that was him in the resurrection because he said destroy this temple and i'll raise it up again that was him conquering hell he knocked on satan's door took the keys away from him and now satan don't have the keys to his own house so why should we pray satan's kingdom he don't even have arrows for his bow he don't have keys to his own house [Music] that was him walking through the ages that was with him with paul that was with him with iranians that was with him with every messenger all the way down through each one of them speaking in tongues then why should we criticize it now why should we criticize worship now well i don't believe in this being slain in this spirit well you obviously haven't heard about john wesley he preached with such power until ten thousand people would be slain in the spirit at the same time don't tell me god don't know how to slay you in the spirit [Music] when you get back up you'll be a different person [Applause] god came in the form of malachi 4. and he used a boy from kentucky to shape the world other ministers around the world would grab their inspiration from him billy graham being one included or robbers being one included oh al jaggers all of those men got their inspiration and credited brother brianna as being the spearhead of the revival but god had a bride he was not going to bring a church he was bringing a bride that would be without spot or wrinkle a bride that would wash away the creeds and the dogmas from our lives the denominational systems sure they had the bible but the bible wasn't open to them sure they could powerfully read the bible but the bible is not a good book for you until it becomes open and once it becomes open and you see yourself in the book for thessalonians tells us that he's been descending down through the ages and he's going to have a bride out of every age overcomers through every age and as we stand on the precipice of the cliff between here in the tribulation period we're not going to be here as we see a world that is so volatile so incredibly volatile my prayer every day is come lord jesus come my prayer every day is come lord jesus come we need a rapture we need a body change the things that we see on a daily basis brother branham and souls now in prison described some of the things that he would see and he called them as dimensions blending out of hell those things that he describes then we see that every day as i walked through the airport the other day i'm a country boy i had never seen naked suits to where that the the the clothes on a person's body is just hoes nothing under it nothing under it nasty nasty they're worshiping their god their body has become a paint surface satan marks his children oh but brother on but it says in the bible it'll mark it mark mark their foreheads you've already missed the point you already missed the point they mark themselves all over the place before long they're interacting in games that's taken them to another world those games to which it's taking them listen let me just say this you a young man got converted last week and he said he said the more marijuana that i was on and the more drugs i was on the natural life became like playing a a game he said that's the reason people can shoot up the community it's because they're so high on drugs until it's just a game that was a boy raised in the message preacher's son you think those games are not taking people somewhere oh but it's just an innocent game do you think those games are not taking people somewhere do you think those light drugs are not taking people somewhere after a while it takes a stronger drug and a stronger drug and a stronger drug a little pornography will take you into home it only gets worse and worse and worse sin takes you further than you ever thought you'd go why are we screaming with all the passion in our life run to the ark of safety [Applause] [Music] that's why you need to have your children in church keeping under the atmosphere so that's him preaching in camp meetings it's the voice behind the voice if all you saw was william branham you missed the picture [Music] we're not here to praise a man and give a man praise although we give him reverence we're not here to give one another praise although we certainly enjoy one another's gift but don't miss the moment when you come to church and enter into his gates with thanksgiving and into his courts with praise to properly give jesus brother branham dealt with it you can hear him deal with it people come and they get an attitude we enjoy coming to church worshiping the lord if we're not too tired i'm going quick i'm going quick let me just share some things psalm chapter 34 i will bless the lord at all times remember this that you have the power of life and death in your tongue point at it just go ahead and point at your tongue you have the power of life and death in that right here right here you have the power you can create an atmosphere around you right here you don't do that with your hands you don't do it with your feet you do with that right there you have the power to release negative words that destroy and you ever been in a room where that everything was just calm and peace one person can walk in a hundred people and have a mighty devil on them and destroy the atmosphere in the whole room that's why we should come to church and pray before we get here because the devil wants a ride so if you're not careful he'll get you in a moody new oh brother ron we don't get moody really elijah got moody brother branham got muted if i hang around you long enough there's going to be days that you're quiet you don't talk are you with me there's going to be days that you hang on these chandeliers that need to be
