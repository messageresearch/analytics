worthy of it all amen We've Come To Worship Him in spirit and in truth we thank you brother Matthew and all of you for setting this atmosphere here tonight it's I just have to say it's one of the most wonderful atmospheres I've walked out to to be able to speak and I just I love that when the Lord feels welcome and it begins to roll out of one room right into a next room and that's that's the power of an atmosphere and and we're just very thankful for that and very thankful for a sensitive song leaders that know how to create an atmosphere so I I certainly appreciate that and we just want to welcome you tonight in the into the house of the Lord all of our visitors here tonight would you say God bless you welcome here and and want to be remembering brother William and his family they're away this weekend speaking down in Georgia there for brother Wade Dale speaking of a few Services there for him this weekend so we want to be remembering brother William this weekend and be remembering us next weekend we'll be headed to brother Donnie Reagan's there in Johnson City to speak a youth meeting for him on the weekend there we'll be taking three services so I just I covet your prayers and that the Lord will do we're expecting great things from the Lord and expecting great things here tonight and I was I was completely going a different course and the Lord stopped me in my tracks yesterday and spoke a word to me and so we'll just follow the leadership of the Lord here tonight and amen let's just go to the author of the word and just go before him I know that there are many physical needs that are amongst us and spiritual needs as well and we know our Lord Jesus Christ is in the building to meet in every meet every single one of these needs and we certainly had a wonderful time with brother Wayne last weekend and the Lord did some amazing things and we saw the pillar of fire come sweeping into the building and actually Brother David Kegley was setting all the way back there and identified at the same time that it was solved that it come right out of this corner comes swooping down through here and you could just feel the transition in that service on Sunday morning it was it was physical it was it was very physical the Lord was here and done some very specific and special things and and I believe that same Lord is here tonight I know we got physical needs that need to be met and I just trust the Lord here tonight that he's more than able to do that so let's just go to the author of the word here begin to speak to him Heavenly Father we come before you tonight Lord wholeheartedly Lord we bow our life before you we recognize that we are insufficient upon our own accord Lord Jesus but we recognize that that our sufficiency is in you father and you're our satisfying portion here tonight and we're just asking that the leadership of the Lord would come tonight and you'd lead every hero tonight through your word father and you would allow us to hear through the the filter of the word Lord not a thinking man's filter but through the Holy Spirit filter and that we would catch every word that is that is for us in this season Lord we know that there are seasons in our life that we are going through but Lord I pray father that right now that you would begin to allow us to reap what you have sown for us Lord and we would begin to manifest the things that have been laying here in the message for years that we would be the manifested sons of God and we would call to order the chaos of our life I know Sister Ruth Ann and brother Donnie Nicholson brother brother Ron and our sister Erica Parker there in Tennessee they have physical needs there's other brothers and sisters brother Randy's sitting here and other needs that are very very needful father and I know God that you're able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we could ever ask or think and father we come before you one more time lord in your house father to worship you in spirit and in truth and we want you to be able to get the glory here tonight out of every person and every every life and we just ask God you would take complete and supreme control have the preeminence in the service let us get out of the way and be a blessing to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray these things in the name of the Lord we pray amen if you have your Bibles we'd like to look over into the New Testament there over into first John chapter 4 and verse 1 and also John chapter 6. and verse 63 first John chapter 4. first John chapter chapter 4 and verse 1. beloved believe not every Spirit but try the spirits whether they are of God because many false prophets are going out into the world hereby know ye the spirit of God every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God and every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God and that is that Spirit of antichrist whereof ye have heard that it should come and even now already it is in the world ye are of God little children and have overcame them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world they are of the world therefore speak they of the world and the world Hearth them we are of God he that knoweth God heareth us and he that is not of God heareth not us hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of Aaron John chapter 6 and verse 63 and our Lord speaking here to us speaks to us and says it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profit if nothing the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life may God bless his word he may be seated in the presence of the Lord I would like to speak to you tonight on a thought that the Lord dropped in our heart yesterday about midday on the spirit the spirit of the word the spirit of the word and I find that that as we as we take of a book of any of any nature that we want to find the spirit of that book whether it be whether it be a novel whether it be fiction or non-fiction whatever it may be you want to find the spirit of that book and you want to find or get in the mindset of the author that is writing that book maybe maybe you're taking a non-fiction book or fiction whatever it may be and you're not going to fully be able to grasp it until you get into the spirit or of the mindset of where the author is take taking you and you can never get in to the mindset of Christ without finding the very Spirit of the letter that is laid out here and we we recognize that there is a spirit that backs up the word that we are reading and we recognize that that we're not just reading a dead letter here tonight but we are reading a letter that has a life behind it and you see this isn't this is not just the words of mortal man that we have been reading throughout our Generations but there this word is our Lord Jesus Christ in letter form and we recognize that that there are a lot of books that are sold and there are a lot of books that are on shelves but there is nothing there is no author that has given his life and be able to go to the grave and come back again except our Lord Jesus Christ and we recognize that when we look into the word here that there is a power that is behind the word of God it doesn't matter if you're reading in Isaiah 53 there is a life that is behind that word it doesn't matter if you're reading over in the book of Jude you're finding that that is the same life that was there all the way back in the Old Testament it's the same exact life that was operating back there all the way in the Garden of Eden and we find that that is the very Spirit of the word now William Branham would say he said now he said if you look at every one of us here he said each of us have a right hand or a left hand and he said if you look at them he said they look alike he said they each have fingerprints they each have their characteristics he said that's exactly like you would look over in the Book of Matthew chapter 24 and you would see that in that last day that there would be an antichrist spirit and a true spirit that would come and they would be so close that you would be it would be hard but the if it wasn't for the spirit of the Lord it would deceive the elect if it was possible but that's the way it is in the last days it's the way it is that Spirits are here in the last day days they are somewhat alike you see you see the difference between your right hand and your left hand is that one of them's right and one of them's your left but you see what the difference they've all got different characteristics they all got fingerprints but the difference is one of them's right and one of them's left but we recognize that there are somewhat alike but there they have a characteristic that identifies them one is the right and one of them is wrong just like the spirits in this state there is a Holy Spirit and there is an antichrist Spirit one of them is right and one of them's wrong and it can be identified by its characteristics and the spirit of God can be identified by its characteristics the spirit of the church can be identified by its characteristic there is a church Spirit a spirit of God that absolutely not like the church Spirit at all there is a denominational Spirit there's a national Spirit he said there's a spirit of the nation Every Nation when I go into it you walk in there and you find a different spirit I went into Finland and they're fine people but there was a finished spirit and I go down into Germany and there's a German Spirit you see you can identify individuals by the characteristics and you'll see and identify by the spirit that they have and you can identify the enemy that you are facing or the the obstacle that you are up against whether it's of God or whether it's of the Enemy by the spirit of the word if it is bringing you closer to God you can identify that it is the holy spirit can you identify that it is the holy spirit that has led you here to this church building tonight to bring you closer to the Lord but you can identify that if it was an evil spirit that would take you out into the world that would make you do wrong things but we recognize that the Bible is very clear to us that the prophecy came not an old by the will of man but it was by holy men of God as they spake they were moved by the Holy Ghost and we recognize that all scripture is given by the inspiration of God so we recognize that if you would take a book of a of a dictionary or or if you take a book of men of of great Scholars you would look at it and put it all together and you would take all of their ideas of their theologies and you would combine it together they would have all kinds of different ideas but you can take the Bible tonight and you can search it from Genesis all the way to Revelations and you'll find that it is the same exact tune all the way through from Genesis to Revelations that Jesus Christ is our Lord he is our Lord you can go all the way there's not another book that is written there's not another book that's on the in the pages or in the Library of Congress that has this one Spirit now brother random he said now he said now he would say now I'm not a preacher and I just want to lay a few things here he said anybody knows that I'm not a preacher he said but I'm made up in a spiritual form of watching things and seeing things move or forewarning people of things that's coming to pass he said it's just my makeup I can't help that no more than you can help that your makeup but God has put us each one in the body to do certain things he said and I watch a little every move of every objective every motive because everything is governed by a spirit he said this church was put here for a purpose speaking in in Shreveport Louisiana at life at Life Tabernacle there at his friend Jack Moore's church and you I think this is pretty profound that he said this church was put here for a purpose he said there is a spirit behind this church certainly Spirit behind your home behind every building behind everything there is a spirit a motive and an objective he said this church comes here he said to greatly exalt some human system or something then its motive is not right but if it's put here to try to achieve something for the kingdom of God then the motive and the objective both is right if the motive is directed the same way if it's all directed the same way you can find that it's going to achieve something for the kingdom of God but you'll find that that later on that they didn't want anything to do with this Malachi 4 Ministry if you go down there to Life Tabernacle where it used to be at that there they have now set up there it's just become a it's just become a holding place and right across the street there's a statue of of Elvis that he was born right there in those streets but you recognize where Life Tabernacle went if you go and look at the where the pastor is today they're far away from being called Life Tabernacle but notice what brother made him say he said now he said I try to stay in the word he said that you get the spirit of the word I try to stay in the word that you get the spirit of the word not based upon some man's theology but thus saith the Lord again he said if there's one thing that I've tried to stay clean of I've never tried any Sensations or anything to get people to look at me I've tried not to even lay my hands upon a person but to preach the gospel and let God do it and he said if there's one thing when I stand the Judgment bar he said I don't want to have anything I don't want to have to give an account for a bunch of illegitimate born children he said I'm going to preach the word to them preach to them the word the word of God and they have the spirit of the word or they don't have it at all you see it's God's spirit that comes by the seed of God is the word of God that's planted in your heart that brings Christ Jesus not some emotion and not some fantastic so if you preach the word and you're sitting here and you're baptized filled with the Holy Ghost you have the very Spirit of the word so you can set here and you can understand what I'm saying to you because you are under the same inspiration that the word of the Lord was written and you would quickly recognize if there would be something that would be preached that would be off key you would quickly identify that as something that is wrong or missed because it's not in the spirit of the word you see if Eve would have been if she would have really stepped into her position she would have recognized that that was Satan talking to her and not almighty God she would have recognized because the spirit behind it was completely off with what the word had already spoken but notice what Paul tells us in Ephesians 1 and 13 in whom you also trusted after that you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation in whom also after that you believe you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of Promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchased possession until the praise of his glory Paul was say in Galatians 5 and 25 he said if we live in the spirit he said let us also walk in the spirit so if we are living in the spirit then our actions have got to prove that they are backed up by the very word of God is that right you see it's just like a gift that is operating in a church if it's not operating according to the Bible then something is off it's not living according to the Bible but if it is a true gift that's been placed into a church it can operate in the channel of inspiration that God has deposited in the church to edify the Church of the Living God and you'll watch whether it's a gift of Prophecy or a gift of wisdom or or a gift of knowledge or a gift of faith it lines itself up with the word of God and immediately all of those gifts of the body begin to operate together to bring the spirit of the body closer to the headship now notice he said he said he it wasn't so from the beginning he said that's the same thing that we've got today he said hear the Holy Spirit he's here in the person of the Holy Ghost he's hunting out and searching out a bride of Jesus Christ you see so right here right now throughout all the Land There is a great holy spirit that is searching out abroad for our Lord Jesus Christ you see but many times people will choke down the experience of the Holy Ghost with their ideas or their Creeds or things of their life but the holy spirit is searching some for somebody that will be a vessel full of the Holy Ghost just like Elise or when they come hunting out abroad for Isaac he come in there under the inspiration of Abraham Abraham had told him to go down there to his Kindred and go down there and pick out a bride for his son Isaac but notice when Lu sir made an Elias are called that Rebecca match the spirit of Eliza's prayer that he had prayed so Rebecca moved right into the spirit of his prayer and Rebecca may not have understood why she was operating the way that she was operating but she was under the anointing of Eliza's prayer and there may be some things that you don't understand why you're going the way that you're going but you're simply operating under the Malachi 4 operation of the anointing of the Holy Ghost you may not fully understand why you're watering the camels fully understand why you're praising God like you are but you're simply under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost and what is it that you're doing you are matching the prophecy that has been given for you toward this day you see what was Rebecca doing she was discovering she was discovering that there was something that was already talked about that she was moving into and when you begin to work into faith and you begin to let your faith loose and all of a sudden you feel the atmosphere begin to change what are you doing you are operating and you're discovering that the word of God has already said that you're already healed so Rebecca was operating in a place that something had already been prepared for her little church let me say to you you are operating in a place that the Holy Spirit has already pre-planned and you might think well this is just another day or I'm just having another bad day or I'm just going through the motions again no there is nothing that is happening to you that our father hasn't already seen that he hasn't already worked out for you that he's working all things for the good to them that love God you see you see you are going to discover in this word that he's got something laying there that is simply for you and for nobody else foreign is that right it's just like when men came here to this earth there we we've come so far I think this past 100 years would be the grandest of times to be living if you could sit down and talk to some of our elders talk about all the changes that we've went through all the discoveries that we've went through I'd say that if we could speak to our grandparents that they would have never thought that they had been talking to a buzzing box without a wire on it 30 years ago or 40 years ago but some man tapped into a channel that you you and I couldn't see it was there when I was born those things weren't there but yet somebody believed that it could be found and they tapped into a channel somebody with an apple tapped into it and looked into it and said you know what I believe that we can have a buzzing box that's got all kinds of applications on it that men will be able to search up whatever they want it's been sitting here all the way since Adam was here but men in this past 100 years have now tapped into that channel where it could be released to you and I now I know that the World Wide Web was created for was created for worldly purposes but it was also created to get this gospel out there is nothing that has been created by Humanity that has not been by Almighty God's inspiration come on somebody you can sit on your iPhone or you can sit there and have a sermon on your iPhone it's see it depends on what inspiration that you're under you see it's like you're riding down the car riding down the road in a piece of metal well most of it's made out of aluminum or plastic nowadays but there was somebody that had the idea to get that metal out of the ground that you're setting on and said you know what I believe I can put this piece of metal put it together and somebody will be able to roll down the wheels roll down the road at a maximum speed of 30 miles an hour well they broke past that but you see somebody had the thought it was laying there all those years come on somebody it was laying there when Luther was here was laying there when all we had was horse and Buggies but it took somebody to discover that we can have the abilities to do these things all of these things were laying here in the word of God but it took a profit under a prophetic anointing to come here and discover that these things are for the Bride of Jesus Christ is that right it's like this beautiful electricity that you have in here Ben Franklin one night watched set out there saw a storm that was coming saw the lightning and thought you know what I need to be able to harness that if man can harness that kind of ability he can use it to put it in his house but he never could get to it and all he did when the lightning struck thy teeth he said I got it but he didn't know what he had I'd say that's the way a lot of people when they first come into the message they said I got it but they really didn't know what they had come on somebody you didn't recognize exactly the Fulfillment of what you were holding in your hand but it is the Fulfillment for a body change come on somebody Spurgeon knew that the ability to open up the seals was coming but it wasn't for him to do it but it took a Thomas Edison to take Benjamin Franklin's idea tap into it and break into a world to discover that we can have a light bulb that we can take that same power that's up there in the sky by lightning and put it in every house now call me crazy but I believe that the same power that came down in the upper room can be in every one of these houses and you may have not have discovered yourself as of yet but there's a holy ghost that is hunting out a bride that's searching for one young girl that's looking for a young man that's so emptied out Paul had to discover himself known as Saul for a long time known as a murderer for a long time but when the pillar fire met him he had been discovered you see the man that was going to write 14 books of your Bible I was going a different way but when the Holy Ghost discovered Paul what did he create he created somebody that would be the first Apostle the first prophet the first church age messenger what did Brian what did Christ what did he expose when he found Paul he found somebody that could set the church in order under the pattern of the Holy Ghost you see what did Edison want to do what was his motive his motive was not just to keep it for himself his motive was to bring it to all this generation Hallelujah and if you want to be healed if you want to be healed you got to have the right motive if you want to be filled with the Holy Ghost you're going to have the right motive if you're simply wanting to be healed so that you can go out and live your own kind of Life have have your own good time go out and create and get yourself more money God is not going to hear your prayer but if your motive is Lord I need to be healed so that I can serve you to a greater ability Lord I need to be healed so that I can raise my daughters or raise my children raise my family so that I could be so that I could be an example you're going to discover that God Is A Healer come here in the right motive tonight you're going to find that the spirit of the word is looking out for somebody can we get a little bit fantastic here just for a moment but I believe that the spirit of the Lord is here to search out somebody to fill them with the Holy Ghost I believe that the spirit of the Lord is here to heal sister Ruth Ann or brother Donnie Nicholson or brother Ron or all these other brothers and sisters I know it seems a little bit fanatical to believe that that the impossible could come in these four corners and create a supernatural event but I want you to know that there's going to be somebody that discovers that the god of the Bible is still the god of today you see what's your motive in behind it of asking now when you're asking for brother odds healing why are you asking for it because you need a pastor because we need an example that God still heals for stage cancer still need a daddy I still need a friend why are we asking for sister Ruth and shiftlets healing it's because it belongs to the Church of the Living God [Applause] come on somebody why you asking for brother Donny's healing because it belongs to the Church of the Living God we need our bass players why are you asking that these young girls get the Holy Ghost because we need them in the economy of God what's your motive in asking we're not asking for our own selfish vain but if you're sick here tonight you're going to find that he's the Lord Our God that heals all of our diseases if you're sick you're going to be able to discover that Isaiah 53 and 5 that he was wounded for your transgressions he was bruised for your iniquities the chastisement of your peace was upon him and by his stripes you are healed what did Jesus Christ do he came under the inspiration of Isaiah and he discovered that his Brokenness was your perfection what did Jesus do he come under the burden of the word I said I am healing for all the nations what was it he discovered that he was layer laying there I'd say there were times when Jesus didn't feel like being Jesus when he's laying back there in the back of the boat he didn't feel like being Jesus he was worn out he'd been preaching but what was he wanting his disciples to do was discover that the power that he had they had it too come on somebody how are you going to get out of the chaos of your life if you don't recognize that there is a discovery that's got to be made this ain't just for Hattie Wright this ain't just for a little fishy this ain't just for a storm this is for the Bride of Jesus Christ we are standing upon top of the greatest discovery that's ever been found I was talking to a guy probably a month and a half ago and he was talking to me about radar and all these things on a fishing boat he said he knows they've got this if they've got the ability to be able to look into the water he said surely you would think they'd be able to find the Titanic I saw thought man what kind of rock are you living under they've already found that joker he's still looking for him to find it and it's already been found some of you still thinking that you're lost but you're already found some of you still going through the same problems that you went through 20 years ago but God's already paid for that you've already been found you've already been sealed you've already been changed come on somebody you're looking at the greatest discovery that the world has ever found it ain't a gold it ain't a gold pot at the end of the rainbow it's me it's Timmy Batten it's Chris Marsh you're looking at the greatest discovery that the world has ever found that same power that created a world is in this body they're trying to find the missing link I'll give them two hundred dollars and I'll tell them where it's at come on somebody they keep looking thinking it's coming from a monkey I could tell them where it came from what was it it was a hillbilly Kentuckian that broke down the word of God what they was looking for all their money that they spent William Bradham tapped into a channel and said it was twins back there in the Garden of Eden what was it it was somebody that was fellowshipping with the one that created the Garden of Eden come on now now what you worried about what you worried about what's your healing what's your process that you're going through what's your problem that you're going through your problems already got an answer to it and the discovery's already been made you don't know how big it is tell your problem how big your God is stop letting stop telling your God how big your problem is and start telling your problem I got the biggest God that there ever has been he never lost a case he never went down in defeat he went down into the grave and he rose up on Easter morning cancer ain't big enough for my God diseases ain't big enough for our God come on somebody they're looking for a cure for cancer but I've already found it the spirit of the word brother Chris has had it's here if the serpent seat is here then the elect of God is here hallelujah what did he do he come under the inspiration of the author of the word notice what Jeremiah said 17-13 he said oh Lord the hope of Israel all that forsake me shall be ashamed and all that depart from me shall be written in the Earth because they have forsaken the Lord the Fountain of the Living Waters Heal Me O Lord and I shall be healed save me and I shall be saved for thou art my praise behold they say unto me where is the word of the Lord let it come now where is it where is the god of Jacob where is the god of Abraham let the god that wrote to her let him come and vindicate the word what did William Branham do stand there night after night said if I've spoke the Lord let him come and confirm it and vindicate that it's true what was he under he was under the inspiration of the angel he was under that inspiration a lot of people don't understand it a lot of people didn't understand why Jeremiah was going through what he was going through known as the weeping prophet he didn't understand it but he was setting a scene for a rejected Christ here send the word of the Lord let it come now a lot of people don't understand what's going on why is this bright Gathering like they are why are they getting under the inspiration of Malachi 4 why are they moving to the sound of the music brother random said in Shalom he said it's like a great Symphony he said to the old looker it's just a bunch of Racket and the only one that knows the secret to the symphony is the composer and those that are interested in knowing about it he said to those that are sitting around it oh they're hearing is a bunch of noise to all those that are sitting around on the outside all they hear is somebody in there praising God but in here but in here the Shekinah Glory is coming down they don't understand the sound of the symphony they don't understand the Beat of the Music but it's coming together you see you see what it is the composer wrote the symphony he knows the ideas of it he knows where it's got to go he knows who's going to play their part and if the director comes out there and he's out from underneath the inspirational composer and he starts paying play and Mary had a little ham when he's supposed to be playing Peter and the Wolf he's coming out to their own sheet music are you hear me today if they're preaching to you that the days of Miracles are gone they're not under the sound of the composer they don't know the junction that has came and at a junction Angels show up and miracles show up and Prophets Show up at a junction in time we are under the inspiration of the composer what is it the composer and the director's got to be in the same spirit I tell you what it's amazing it's amazing when you go to watch it one of them symphonies that little dude can take that little white stick tap it on the edge of that stage and bring chaos to order it's amazing how the inspiration of the Holy Spirit can come you had a bad day things messed up this week the air condition ain't right somebody sent me a Pew your hair didn't get curled right this humidity is just getting to me it ain't even summer yet but they all of a sudden get under the inspiration of the composer I didn't think that old dinky little director that's up there and he's just he don't know what he's doing but he gets under the inspiration of the composer and he brings all the sheet music together he's saying that I'm a part of the third pole he's saying out of the midst of this chaos in a time of trouble that he's going to hide me in his Pavilion he's saying unto me that he's the mighty Angel that's standing with me when I'm going through my crisis he's saying to me that I when I'm going through my worst of trials that I'm in the spirit of the word he's saying about me that when I'm going through laodicea that I'm believing for a body change even though I'm walking past people that's got blue hair and all kinds of different things all over their faces he's talking about me he's bringing all of my chaos of the week together I'm making it sound like that this is a people that is coming forward you're getting it you're getting it what is it all of a sudden those gifts that are sitting there the trumpet and the trombone and the and the tambourines Hallelujah and all of the snares and everything it's coming together the woods are coming together the string instruments are coming together what are they doing they're rallying around that gift what are you doing here believing that God heals cancer you're rallying around a gift what are you doing believing that God is going to change your body you're rallying around a gift you're not rallying around William Branham you're rallying around the Holy Spirit come on somebody that's the greatest thing that we could do tonight is not Rally around brother Ron or brother Tim or brother Dottie or brother Ed piscal but to Rally around the holy ghost that is the gift of all gifts he's the greatest thing that ever has been and if you can rally around it it doesn't matter your background it doesn't matter where you came from it doesn't matter what you're going to go through he's the Lord our God That Forgives all of your iniquities that heals all of your diseases what did Israel do when they were in the midst of trouble in the Book of Judges there was a man by the name of Samson that was four and a half feet tall that had the ability to destroy Giants they begin to Rally around him and it didn't make a liquor sense but he'd come in there under the expiration all right he come under the expression of the gift that God put on the inside of him what was he doing he was revealing to those Philistines the expression that God had put on the inside of him that I am the deliverer for Israel and what did Israel do they rallied around that gift and he expressed to those Philistines that he was even though he's four and a half foot tall even though he was a mama's boy had seven little curls hanging off the back of his head he was showing to those Philistines that I'm the expression of the Revelation for the hour that we're living in what did William Branham do in this hour he showed to us what the expression of God was for the Revelation for this layout of cnh and Samson beat down a thousand for listings didn't make a lick of sense but to him he heard the sheet music he was under the inspiration of a composer and he was working it out he was working the word out right through his body hallelujah what was William Branham doing he was introducing to you that this is the mind of Our Lord he was showing you that were living in door worlds bad days good days Happy Days sad days on the mountain in the valley but you're a duel spirit being you're built you're built to live in another world what did William Branham do he told us and taught us what the spiritual world was he told us he awakened us up to the god of the Supernatural and he said now many times you hear him say now he said no I'm standing here in Two Worlds it's amazing it's amazing that he could be sitting here sitting at the platform or sitting in his bed and he's in another dimension what was it I believe it's in forget the title of it but anyways when when brother Branham was standing there and he goes beyond the curtain of time and he goes there he's looking down upon his body I believe he said he wasn't 20 feet from his body but there he was in another world he was looking at that world that you're going to where that sister that was 90 years old that had just gave their heart to the Lord was standing there and it wasn't even 20 feet away now what was it he was showing to us that error was a discovery that there was two worlds that we are living in that we recognize that even though even though we're facing battles facing trials facing all kinds of chaos that we're wrestling not against flesh and blood but against principalities against rulers of darkness and spiritual wickedness in this evil age he was showing to us that we're not just facing Natural Things there's a lot of people that face natural things that they do on their own and I think man the devil's sure after me a lot of that's our own stupidity I mean to be honest you keep falling in the same trap that you went into that your own stupidity come on somebody if you fall in the same hole that you've been walking past all your all your years and you fall right back into it that's your own dumbness for walking into it but sometimes there is a spirit that gets behind you and pushes you in a hole that's an effort but he's showing to us he he's showing to us the ability to overcome that world That You Don't See we overcome him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of Our Testimony all right brother Brian I'm talking in question answer this week said brother random I'm a Christian I'm born again I've been filled with the Holy Ghost but I fight stubbornness he said if you'll go and study back all of your family history he said there's a line that lays there in your family they've always fought stubbornness I know I ain't talking to any of y'all because they know y'all stubborn now y'all just me come from Dean's family but if you go study it out he said it's from that all the way down there he said but he said it's like a tantalizing little snake it's always trying to get at you he said if you'll just walk away from it and leave it over there he said because James 4 and 7 tells us to submit ourselves therefore to God and resist the devil and he will flee from you you see you've got an expectation that you can walk away from that by the word of the Lord you see all you've been told throughout your family history is this one's got anxiety and that one's got anxiety so I guess you'll have to deal with anxiety I don't believe that's the way that our sons and daughters need to be talking that our mama dealt with this or daddy dealt with this I'm gonna brag on my little alley just for a minute she's a little Christian she's got her faults and failures and if you don't want to know the truth don't ask her but one thing that she is she's a prayer Warrior I heard her in there the other day she was just tormented she's just tormented by by something that she that she deals with laughs some of us deal with that a lot keeping our mouth shut you know but she was standing in there she wasn't saying she was letting in her brother Chris saying I'm subject to this all my life I'm subject to this she was standing in there and rebuking that thing that's exactly way Sons and Daughters need to be well he said well that's just reality absolutely not you needed a break into a world that you start rebuking the things that keep hindering you in your Christian Life I'm not going to be subject anxiety I'm not going to be subject to the natural world I'm not going to be subject to depression I'm not going to be subject to alcohol I'm not going to be subject to that it's time that you serve notice on the devil today start rebuking the devil and tell him that he's underneath your feet if you expected you'll get what you expect in our Lord Jesus Christ what did William Branham do he opened our expectation to believe that all things are possible come on now If Abraham discovered that he was a shady eye you can discover that his health Shady eye if William Branham tapped into a channel that an angel would come and talk to him and said not even cancer would stand before your prayer you can tap into that channel what did he do he awakened our expectation many times you'll hear it you'll hear it I'm gonna burn them and I I've been searching for two days a story that brother bisco told us when we were there one time but I'll just refer to it I if you can find it I'll be sure glad because I spend countless hours looking for it but brother biscal told us one time he said there he said one time he said there was standing in front of a step brother Brandon would stand in front of a lady that was standing there and she was she was uh standing there and said you went to doctor after doctor after doctor and they can't find the source of what's wrong can't find the source of what's wrong he said but what it is he said when you as a little girl you fell down a well brother bisco said it in this way he said he said what caused it he said it loosed up when you fell it loosed up all of your organs and they've been looking for that and hear this girl had been suffering with this for years for years but now she's standing in front of the one that had discovered the problem now who was that where was William Branham operating in if he was operating outside of the word you and I wouldn't be here but because he was operating right with the word that little girl walked away healed you can go tell this time said doctors it's hid from the doctors it's it's hid from there but you Satan you can't hide from almighty God what is it Satan had been discovered like when when he's there in Africa and they they lead that man up there by the chain you know the story those those tears are dropping off of his his black belly he's in he said they're dropping off of him he's got he's not only got a infirmity in his body but he's lost his sound mind foreign and that boy in his condition begin to think about his brother that brother Brandon said was a city block away he said now I I see he said I see your your thinking you've got on your heart your brother and he said he fell off a yellow goat or a yellow dog and he's been on clubs all this time and when William Branham said that a city block away there come a man screaming all the way back there now what did he touch what did he touch his faith had made him whole that little boy in that condition had enough Faith to touch the master and in your crisis and in your trial when you didn't expect anything to come it's like brother Chris working on your house and all of a sudden you're hitting you're you're going after a nail and all of a sudden you you don't hit the nail you hit your thumb they hit your thumb you didn't expect that to happen but man you walked around shook it a little bit moaned about it a little bit but it didn't keep you from going back and hitting the nail again and just because you didn't expect the trial to come your way the way that it came doesn't mean that you stopped believing just because things don't happen the way that you expect them to happen don't give up on God man let me down this one let me down don't you give up on God because God ain't gonna give up on you that God his condition when he was sitting there and he'd been and he'd been used to make a living by dancing around but William Benham saw a vision over top of him but not only was he healed he came to his sound mind what was he showing us that our expectation can be awakened to the fact that God is alive again he said in Blind part of Mayors I'm going to go through a few things and I'm going to finish he said but he's dealing with the face he said do you believe that thou can't believe thou can't receive it have faith now just be real reverent you believe anything can happen oh I wish I could let my audience know what a feeling that this is to you scientists to you sue study scientific culture may I say it in this way that's The Fifth Dimension it's another world you go down a person's life only by the grace of God now here's another strange lady never seen or only Jesus knows the woman I don't never seen her in my life but he knows you if he will reveal to me what your trouble is will you accept it and believe it now the lady I see her going somewhere it's an examination it's before doctors they're giving her something another as a treatment it's it's it's a treatment for a dark shadow that hangs its cancer treating her for cancer and though though that it's made her really really nervous that's thus save the Holy Spirit he said now one thing that you are in your spiritual life you might that you might know that I'll be his servant you are always trying to reach up to something that you have never been able to get a hold of that's right and you're needing it and you made a promise to God by the side of a bed that if God would let you get well that you would surrender your whole life and being to him in prayer by the side of a bed that's right that's just save the Lord You're not from this city you're from another city Pauline is your name that is right Pauline you return home Jesus Christ has made you well surrender yourself to him and you'll be healed what did that patient discover that the almighty knew where she was praying at beside her bed asking to go forward you and I wouldn't be here if this message operated outside of the Bible but we've been discovered that William Branham was a man of God's word and I'm I'm gonna take a real hard turn right here but I believe it's for you but it's kind of like when brother best school my brother bisco tells in his testimony you can go listen to it brother biscal made those things available for us again and then I am a witness series but he tells that story about brother Branham as he's going up there and going after that brown bear you know the story you know that that brother Brown he missed that he missed where he was supposed to be at do you remember that that brother Branham had that vision of that brown bear that he was going to kill but it didn't get fulfilled it didn't get fulfilled because he was at the wrong place and he remembered that the Lord spoke to him and that Vision told him said go with those young young boys and he warned him three times go with those young boys he showed them three times in division go with those young boys but you remember when when he's up there and he's up in that country and he's and he's in that country and the panoramic looks like it's a surrounding of Alaska and different things and they're up there where brother Blaine or and brother Bud Southwick in there they're up there and they're hunting and and because brother Branham didn't want to hurt brother Bud's feelings when he said when he said Blaine you take Billy Paul and Eddie you go out this way brother Branham knew he was supposed to go with those young boys but he didn't want to hurt Bud's feelings and you remember that after brother that while Eddie's out there hunting they're out there they see that Mammoth brown bear out there he goes out there and he sees it he goes out there and he sees it and shoot it shoot it shoot it he said no I want brother Brandon to get something like this he ain't shot yet and they go back to the camp go back to the camp and it rains for the rest of their time out there and brother Brown said I'm ready to go now I'm taking a real hard turn right here but I believe it's going to bless you he said it went in there and brother Brandon said I'm ready to go and while they're packing up brother Brandon said Eddie where'd you see that brown bear at he said well I saw it back here and described it to him where he was and he went all the way back there to where it was and brother brother biscal said he he had this look on his face he knew that the Lord was dealing with and he went back there and he come back and he said I'm the reason when he come back he said I'm the reason for our trip he said I've been a Jonah I've been a Jonah he said but it's all over now and we're gonna ride out of here dry it had rained for three or four days the whole the whole country was completely wet the the biscal said that all of the trees were all the trees were dripping off with water he said I wouldn't be here today if we had a road out of there and we had a road out and getting wet he said but we rode out completely dry he said that's why I'm here today foreign but notice he said he said I've been a Jonah I was supposed to be with you fellas he said it's the second time that I disobeyed the vision the other time was in Africa he said but it's over and we're going to ride out of here dry and in 20 minutes time brother biscoll said it was completely dry he said just come a puff of wind and the whole panoramic was dried The sun hadn't shined for all them days but brother Brandon when he comes back and he preaches countdown countdown he comes he says so he said in these 30 going on 32 years of ministry he said I've tried to stay true to the word of God he said I don't know one thing I've ever had to alter on because I I just read it out of the Bahama just said what the Bible said and let it go I like it like that he said so I haven't had to take back or rearrange it he said because I just said it the way that the Bible says it he said and I found out I find out if God has spoken anything then it we must go with that word in order to make it be fulfilled we've seen that as I told you last night of a vision just recently he said I had to be there and a warning to be there and telling me six months before me to be on that spot and stand there and saying go down there three times with them he said I just walked on with them other men and the vision passed right on through exactly God's part and he said I was left standing and he said so we want to remember you've got to stay on the word you've got to stay on the word just stay with the word and where the word leads and go right with the word then it'll bring you all right all right said if we wouldn't erode out dry he said I wouldn't be here but William Branham was a man enough to know that he'd missed the vision that the vision had it transpired exactly like it said it would but he was out of its place and sometimes we get our feelings in the way let me go a little bit further just for a moment we get our feelings in the way and think my goodness I only feel like I'm saved your feelings have nothing to do with your salvation just stay with the word salvation is not based upon your feelings it's based upon receiving Jesus Christ and as the Lord by faith your feelings are going to vary from one moment to the next moment Jesus went from the highest of feelings to the lowest of feelings he wept at lazarus's grave he understood the joy of getting people to receive him and receive his word but he went through it and he stood there when people rejected him when people spit on him the feelings didn't change who Jesus was I don't understand how some Visions are going to come to pass there's visions of the Lord has given us there's Visions as the Lord's given brother Ron and other brothers said there's no way that you can explain how it's going to happen or why or how it's going to work its way out but I'm not going to doubt it all I'm going to do is get in line with it and get into the spirit of it and if you're in the spirit of it you can expect that it's going to come to pass I can follow a man that tells us that he was wrong that he was in the wrong spot well I don't know about that I don't know if I can follow a man that's making mistakes how about you how many mistakes have you made how many times did you give up on God and change your mind how many times did you miss where the word said but you still came back because God is rich in his Mercy don't you doubt the vision don't you miss what's going on get into the spirit of it thank you Don't Mess what he did at Calvary don't miss what he's doing now get into the spirit of it foreign you get under the inspiration of it I'm done you stand up and finally you get under the inspiration of it everything's going to work out exactly like it what should it be that's right don't you try to move the Hat don't you try to make it happen well this one gave up on God and this willing participant ain't going to be in the vision because they said they don't want it to come to pass let me tell you God would do what he's got to do laughs I'll tell you it's a dangerous thing to give up on a vision it's a dangerous thing to give up on the word of God it's well I don't want nothing to do with that no more you better be careful God will raise somebody else up to put in the vision come on somebody well I don't believe that let me tell you God will raise up an Isaac or he'll raise up an Andrew or he'll raise up a ray Lambert he will raise up anybody that is willing to serve him no matter what let me take a look at your family history just for a moment every one of you got scars and complexes and mistakes but God said I'm rich in Mercy I'm good enough I have an expectation that they are going to make it God ain't concerned about his word working its way out he knows who's going to fulfill it I'm going to fulfill my portion What If Abraham say you know what I'm just too old for this [Music] I'm too old for this I don't I don't too old take a look at me does this look like a body or somebody that wants to produce a child what are you doing you're getting rid of Genesis 15 all the way to 23. what are you doing you're getting part you're getting rid of all of Genesis you're getting rid of the faith you're getting rid of the trial you're getting rid of fruit you're getting rid of all of his testings are getting rid of it all well I want everything easy let me tell you stop asking yourself why am I going through this trial and start asking yourself who who's the one doing this to me and who's going to get me out why me why me why am I going through this why cancer keep coming my way why trials keep coming my way why don't you say who's going to be the one that answers the call who's going to be the one that answers and says I'm able who's going to be the one that says I'm Healed thank you don't get rid of your problems because you're getting rid of your miracle [Music] come on somebody the Bible is very evident on this point I'm the Lord that supplies all of thy needs what was Paul telling us in Philippians 4 19 I'm the Lord thy God that supplies all of our needs what's he telling us in second Corinthians 9 and 12 that this ministry that you are under is giving you the abundance of what your supply is and it's giving you an inspiration to pour out the blessings upon God yeah you got troubles yeah you got trials we have been awakened to the fact that out of our trials out of our chaos out of my crisis comes the greatest miracles [Music] how Jerry and Stephanie Breeden go through the trial that they went through 13 years ago and come out with a beautiful Miracle named Rebecca if I could have in that moment I'd have gave my own life for that little baby but God was working out the details that I'm sufficient for this life I don't know what we just tapped into but we tapped in some to me I'd have stood right here this pulpit and I stopped you I said don't go down that way don't don't don't all I did was I just preached the word preached the word preach the word and the word worked its way out in your life
