we're certainly thankful to have our lord jesus with us this evening amen we as brother matthew said we we want to extend our condolences to the pruitt family and sister sister karen was a queen and handled herself exactly so and she there's a great big void that is missing there and a light of of this day has went out but as we know that that will be one that we will see on resurrection morning and we sorrow not as those who have no hope but we know that that those that go on before us will be the ones that meet us in the air and we want to remember brother tim and and church family and the whole entire pruitt family there and i know the strain of all of that and we're just praying for them earnestly not just today and they they had the they had the burial today and the graveside and

sister sister nancy and and so we want to continue to remember them also just want to make mention uh forgive me for these few announcements before we go forward but we want to make mention again to you so that you're aware but our labor day meeting has been canceled and due to the current things that are going on with the covet breakout at brother donnie's and and uh not just that brother donnie's but just that circumstance then north carolina and places there also to brother tim and brother timothy situation that they're going through so we've just decided to cancel that meeting we'll still be having services here so we'll just lord willing and lord willing we're going to have some as we do every weekend we're going to have a meeting with the lord and so we just want to be remembering those things and just just to make mention you know it lord willing we're still going to be having service every single weekend until the rapture comes but just due to the current virus that is taking off again and what i'm understanding is that this thing will shut back down as quick as it took off but you know god knows all of that but in saying that if if as we have said throughout our our time here if you feel bad you stay home because whatever you got i don't want and we don't want to hinder these services anyway i'm not giving the excuse to stay home but i am giving you an excuse if you feel bad you can play brother andrew i'm not at church because he told me if i was feeling bad now i'm not talking about feeling sad but i'm talking about if you feel bad and if you think if you think it's more than just an allergy or a sinus issue please just take out a caution for everybody here i think at full gospel lighthouse we enjoy these services that we're having and i know that it would be a blessing if we can continue the path that we're on and uh so we just want to make that mention to you you know just do your due diligence wash your hands take your vitamin d3 brother home right here but i'm going to tell you take your vitamins stay prayed up stay filled up on the holy ghost amen i believe god's greater than than any sickness we come up against but it doesn't make us immune from those things but we do have a god we do have a god that healeth that healeth all of our needs amen let's just go to the lord this evening let's go to him in prayer amen heavenly father we so love and appreciate you lord you've been so mindful of us lord all the days of our life lord you see lord you see the congregation there at evening light tabernacle lord you see how their hearts are hurting father lord do you see the pain that they're in but you made us a promise that you would comfort us you'd be with us you touch our lives and now i ask god that you would make yourself very known to the entire pruitt family father they mean so much to us here full gospel lighthouse i don't believe words would be able to express how much the pruitt's mean to us sister karen was loved here and appreciated we will certainly miss her laughter we will certainly miss the gift of god that she had lord i pray that you would just be with brother tim not just today but the days coming in the months ahead i pray that you'd guide him now lord jesus i i pray god that tonight that you'd come by our way lord you'd minister to us lord in a very supernatural way we're just very thankful father for the grace of god that's been extended our way we pray father one more time as we yield ourselves to you i pray that you'd come and take over our lives minister to us upon

sing that song didn't i walk on the water as we get ready to go to the word this evening as i kneel in the darkness in the middle of the night i'm praying for assurance everything's gonna be all right and lord i see another battle oh out in front of me and i'm afraid i won't be able and i'll go down in the feet but the lord said do you remember oh where i brought you from just take a look behind and how far you've gone and every time you ask me didn't i deliver you so why would you be thinking that i wouldn't see you through didn't i walk on the water didn't i calm the rage and see [Music] i spoke to the wind it hushed and i gave you peace and didn't i run to your rescue and didn't i hear you when you call i'll walk right beside you so you wouldn't fall and didn't i leave all of heaven just to die for your sin i searched until i found you and i do it all again now in the midst of this chaos he came by our way he proved himself to us oh in this last day he said cancer wouldn't stand before his servant's prayer so why don't you get out of here and get on back to heaven and i gave you peace and didn't i run to your rescue didn't i hear you when you called i walked right beside you so you wouldn't fall and did not leave all of heaven just to die and for your sin i searched until i found you and i do it all again hallelujah i believe that with everything that's within me amen if you have your bibles this evening we like to look over in the book of hebrews chapter 11 and verse 6 and then down in the book of jude chapter 1 and verse 3 well before we before we read the scriptures this evening as you're finding your way to the book of hebrews and the book of jude there well branham said in the message the supernatural and he said that's the reason sometimes a divine life that's been called and set aside has become a fanatic or or crazy or a mystical or something to the eyes of the general public is because you're considered i'd say a neurotic or an insane person because that you're changed your dwelling place and got into a different atmosphere and your one motive and your one thought is to stay in that atmosphere and any person that's ever come into that atmosphere one time will never be satisfied nowhere else and that's why i believe that we should have our churches under control by the holy ghost that men and women in their work and wherever they should be should continually desire and they will if they ever once come into that atmosphere again it's the atmosphere that brings the miraculous and wonders and powers of god amongst the people it's the atmosphere of the people it's the atmosphere of the people it's not the atmosphere of angels it's not the and it's not the atmosphere of principalities but it's the atmosphere of the people amen hebrews chapter 11 and verse 6 but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him jude 1 and verse 3 beloved when i gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints you may be seated in the presence of the lord let's read that last portion of that scripture and jude and exhaust and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints i truly believe that it's the desire of every christian and every son and daughter of god to constantly be in the atmosphere of the holy ghost and to be in the atmosphere of the presence of god and i truly believe with everything that's within me as a son of god and as a minister of this gospel that that the winds of change are blowing and that the atmosphere is charged with the supernatural for miracles to be produced and i believe with all of my heart that the atmosphere is set for the changing of the body and you can see as gravity as it begins to loose yourself as you loose your hands up and you loose your praise loose and you're watching that the atmosphere is getting set for the supernatural to take place and that's what we need in every single service is for the atmosphere to get right no matter what who is preaching no matter what the subject is it's the atmosphere to get right before there can ever become a change in somebody's life before there can ever be a move before there can ever be a healing that has got that has taken place it's got to be an atmosphere to take place it's just like it's just like when the powers of god get to moving the atmosphere is set for somebody to receive that word that is going forth and this book that we read from in the book of jude it's a very brief book but yet it's a very powerful book and to me it's one of it's one of my favorite readings to do and to go over and to look at the book of jude but jude was a it was an epistle and he was and as he was writing jude believed in not allowing that the allowing the negative to to influence the he didn't allow it was not allowing the negative influence of the enemy to come in and destroy the works of god and actually if you go through that chapter and go through it at your own time and come through that you'll find that jude goes through there and he unmasked all of the false teachings and and all of the the antichrist spirit that's that is coming through there and yet here he is he's exposing that by the very word of god and he made an appeal to all the christians of that day and even under this tale unto this day to the church he appealed to them to earnestly contend for the faith but he didn't say a faith but he said the faith to earnestly contend for the faith and we realize that the bible tells us that there's one faith there's one lord one faith one baptism one god and father of all who is above all and through you all and in you all but he is telling us that we are contending for the faith but notice that this has been when jude is writing this i believe it was about 33 years after after christ's ascension that jude is writing this writing this book but here he is not contending for the faith of the levitical laws but yet here he is he is saying we are contending for the faith of a living god of a supernatural god it was not something that that they were looking back to some historical affair but here jude was saying that we would earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered unto the saints and here jude writes this letter he writes this letter to stir up the faith that was on the inside of a people and here we're living in an hour when the restoration of faith when we're watching when the ministry of malachi 4 is at its peak and in its season and in its time it is a returning back to the faith of the pentecostal fathers and we realize that without faith it is impossible to please him i believe that's every one of ours desires this evening no matter how young you are no matter how old you are no matter how long you've been in church or how little time you've been in church but it is our desire that we please him and i believe that one of these days he will take us but we realize that every time that faith sets itself up that the devil turns he turns every gun in hell right on it like that because faith is setting itself up and anytime you as a person as a believer you start setting yourself up in faith you'll watch when the enemy comes in and he tries to destroy you he tries to destroy your family he tries to destroy your reputation he tries to destroy who you are he tries to destroy your experience and says you really didn't get anything or he says nothing really happened or it was just a workup or an emotion but you know down on the inside of you that you're not the same as you was when you first came to the lord so you can take him back to the word and you can take him back to your experience and you can recognize that it's the atmosphere of the holy ghost that change you now now many of you you sit here and and many of you have a different testimony of where you came out of some catholic some methodist some looking for different things but every single one of us can say that we came out of sin is that right but we realize that the enemy will try to trap us into all kinds of things of making us feel like we're not good enough and making us not realize our worth to the lord but yet the holy ghost can come in a service and the holy ghost can speak to you and tell you to to realize you're worth to to have a little gumption about yourself to have a little pride about yourself and realize that you're a child of the most high god that you are birthed by the word of the lord and the blood of jesus christ cleansed you he made you anew he washed you he changed you you're not the creature that you once was but you are a new creature in christ jesus and it's the atmosphere that does the changing it's not the man it's not the preaching anybody can take words and anybody can put words together but it's the atmosphere of the holy ghost that makes a difference and when that enemy comes in and tries to tell you that your experience isn't true or tries to tell you that what you have is just some emotion emotion might leave an emotion might come but that which sets up on the throne room of your heart can never leave because you are sealed until the day of your redemption by a holy ghost that is not giving up on you and when the enemy comes in against you do like james 4 and 7 says submit yourself therefore unto god and resist the devil and he will flee from you and when the enemy is doing his job you do your job he can attack you all he wants but you start attacking back at him and saying i am a child of god i'm not a chart newt the true foul twofold child of hell but i am a child of the living god i know my position in christ i know where i'm at i know where i'm standing at i know what happened and i drove my marker down at that spot where the holy ghost met me there was a there's a story about an old man he went to a tent revival and he went there and every time he'd go he went throughout the week the enemy kept whipping him over things that had happened to him said well you did this or you did that there's no way that you got and he went back down to the altar the next night and he went back down there the next night and he went back down there the next night and the enemy just kept whipping him day after day over those things well finally it come to a spot and he took a he took a sledgehammer and he took a and he took a big a great big steak and when it come time for the moving of god he took that stake and he took that he took that sledgehammer and went down there to the altar and he drove in a stake in the ground and said there is where i met my lord jesus let me tell you you can always come back to that spot that that's where i met him that's where i got changed that's where i gave up my old self and he gave me all of himself and jude says that jude didn't come in there with some week with some weak uh letter to us but he comes in there as a defender of the faith that's something you're going to have to do is you're going to have to defend yourself you're going to defend what happened to you last weekend the enemy would love to come in and rob what happened to you last weekend he loved to come in and whisper in your ear well that was just a pastor or that was just a or that was just an emotion or that was just a time or a season that's what the enemy is coming to do but you've got to defend this faith you got to stand up on your own two feet not when the pastor's there or when your friends are there but stand up on your own two feet be like a man stand like a man say hey i know what happened to me down there it's the enemy's job to whisper to you it's the enemy's job to make you mad it's the enemy's job to tear you apart it's the enemy's job to make you mad at somebody sitting in this building it's the enemy's job for you to get upset but don't be a coward and run for cover but stand up and say hey that's my position that's my inheritance and the enemy is going to do his job he's going to try to kill to steal and destroy your life he's going to try to kill the move of god he's going to try to shut down the power he's going to try to shut off the emotion trying to shut down the atmosphere and shut down and kill your life [Music] not happening not happen but the book of john 1 john 5 and 4 said that whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith when jesus comes when jesus comes to a very very critical moment when jesus is always teaching his followers but jesus comes to a moment when when there is when there is a sycamine tree that will not produce and jesus curses that thing and when the disciples were walking back past it they looked at it and they wondered at this but jesus looked at them and they told them have faith in god what a profound what a profound sentence have faith in god that whatsoever things you when you desire when you pray believe that you shall receive them and you shall have them now now i want you to hear me real loud and clear there's a lot of people that that get numb to praying they get numb to warning they get numb to they get numb to of just going through the motions and and saying the same prayer even though they haven't seen it yet even though they they don't know it they get numb to it because they they keep repeating that prayer keep asking for that let me say you need to be purged by the power of prayer so that your desire will come out on the other side just the way you prayed it there's a lot of people that give up on prayer there's a lot of people that give up on what they ask for there's a lot of people that don't go far enough they give up because they ain't seen no fruition of it what you need to do like jesus did is curse that tree that keeps standing in front of you and ain't producing fruit oh i just took you to a whole other level what you need to do is to curse the thing that keeps robbing you from eating off the tree of life and curse the very demon that is causing you to not have what you asked for now and question and answers brother brandon brother branham was was speaking about the the human being that the contact with this world he's speaking about the five senses how that this man is built to contact this this fleshly this fleshly world but notice he says he said his faith sets his destination where he's hid it for he said now faith is a substance of things hoped for the evidence of things that you don't see tastes feel smell or hear but by faith when he catches the word it sends him into a dimension that makes it so real to him till he's just as good as he's got it in his hand he knows it's going to happen so when sight won't give it to you and when feeling won't give it to you that's where faith takes over you remember in the bible when there was a servant of elijah that that that couldn't see there elisha and his servant gahesa they there elijah was anointed a man of god to look over into the king of syria and look over in there and tell the king of israel of all of the enemy's plans and there was a man in the camp that told him said that that servant elijah knows the things that you're saying in your very bed chamber but yet when the king of syria took all of his army up there and he went up there and he was going to he was going to go up there after elijah when the hazel woke up early in the morning ghazal went out there and he saw that the whole host of the syrian army had surrounded the city and he made this comment he called on his master and he said last last master how shall we do seeing these things but elisha just stood real still and he said fear not for there's more with us than there is with them and elisha made a prayer sometimes when you get in that moment when you can't see what's moving around you you need to have yourself a prayer you need to have a prayer meeting with god where you say god i need to see the things the way you see things not the way that i want to see them not the outcome that i want to see but let me see the way you want me to see fear not fear not there's more with us than there is with them and elijah prayed god opened up his eyes that he might see and when he looked out there he seen that there was horses of fire and chariots of fire that was hanging on every bushes on the mountainside you see that man was outnumbered all of the syrian army was outnumbered because there was a mighty host that was with elisha elisha didn't even see that they were there he didn't even have to look that they were there but he realized that psalms 91 was in effect he realized that psalms 34 was in effect that the angel of the lord encamps about them that fear him he didn't have to see it with his eyes he didn't even have to look into that realm but he knew that the word said that they'd be there he was resting in that whether he seen it or whether he didn't he was resting in what the word said and when there is when there was and an opening to gehazer's eyes he come to the revelation that there was more with us than there is with them so let me say this to you before you feel it or before you see it the supernatural is here and the supernatural is ready and the supernatural's willing it's easy to have faith when you can see things you ain't even gotta have faith when you can explain things but faith is when you don't see it faith is when he's you're standing toe-to-toe with the devil and you look like abraham looked at it and you look at it and say well i don't know when it's coming but i know it's coming and against all odds and against all hope i'm gonna believe that the baby is coming even though sarah's fussing everything's not right she's all tore up because we're down here and lot's wives down there and got all the goods of the city but there came a man walking down a dusty road how did abraham know that that was melchizedek because he had an atmosphere he'd been in a conversation with him before he'd been in a relationship with him before and when he had that talk and he said when he said to abraham and he started talking to him brother branham said he he abraham ran into the tent where sarah was says honey come here and take a look our hour of visitation is at hand let me tell you something i've been in prayer when i felt this atmosphere i've been in prayer when i seen the moving of god i've been in prayer and i felt that sweep come through there i believe with all of my heart that this is the hour of our visitation that the things that we've prayed for that the things that we've asked for will come into fruition because the atmosphere is charged with the supernatural help me jesus zacharias excuse me in luke chapter 1 verse 11 the bible said and there appeared unto him speaking of zechariah an angel of the lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense whether you see him or whether you don't that angel was watching many times we we get accustomed to this is just another service you've heard me say it and it's easy to do but i'm only bringing you to the recognition to be aware that there's something greater than myself brother ron or any other minister that is standing there and maybe maybe you don't know this but i i was preaching a couple weeks ago and i may never ever preach on that subject again on the god who sees speaking about hagar and that the angel of the lord saw her and brother ron looked at me and told me now be real steady that angel the lord standing right there now it may have not been another service it may have not been enough it may have been just another service for you but for me i felt his effects and i felt the atmosphere but for somebody to see it for somebody to see it are you with me now i know i'm going to bring this i'm going to bring this to you now but now now it's one thing for me to feel it and it's one thing for you to feel it it's one thing when mary begin to feel something on the outside but whenever on the inside but when everybody started seeing on the outside what was happening on the inside it was more than just another temple service for mary she saw herself in that scripture let me say something i saw myself in that moment that god saw me through all of my pain god saw me god will not waste your pain what you're going through what the pain you've been going through in your past god will not forget where you're at but zacharias notice that the angel of the lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense and when zechariah saw him he was troubled and fear fell upon him but the angel said unto him fear not zacharias for thy prayer is heard and thy wife elizabeth shall bear thee a son and that shall call his name john you don't know how long they pray for this boy you don't know how long they'd ask for this boy you don't know how many things that they've asked where's john at where's that john at i've been asking for him where's that john at where's that baby i was looking for the one that's going to come out and break the womb where's that one and there an angel came and spoke john's coming into existence john's coming but here's zacharias because of fear and begin to trouble he begin to disbelieve what he prayed for he failed to see all those prayers he'd set up you know how many times elizabeth had went through this crisis every 28 days john ain't coming yet the baby ain't coming yet but he failed to see all those things that he prayed for but the angel the angel was going to make sure that even though he may have forgot what he prayed about john even though mama man forgot what he prayed about john maybe it seemed like the time had passed them but the angel was concerned about john getting there and you may be disconcerned about your loved one coming in or you might be disconcerned about producing somebody that's going to come forth you might be disconcerned with this service but there is going to be an angel that no matter how you feel no matter what you see he is going to bring forth john zacharias you may fail to see it you may forget what you prayed but the angel's going to make sure that john gets here he might have to shut your mouth up so you don't say something crazy he might have to shut your mouth up so that you disbelieve and speak out of existing what's coming but john's coming [Applause] john's coming and elizabeth and zacharias they went back after his time of menstruation when administration in a temple and he went back there and she conceived what was it there was scripture hanging over john that was scripture hanging over zacharias he may have failed to see that that here he was a a minister of the temple and he may have failed to see it but there was one coming i hear a voice of one crying in the wilderness zechariah's disbelief or not knowing what was going to happen ain't that the way most of us do ain't that the way most of us do we pray for something and then a minister stands up over top of you and he prophesies that the thing that you pray for is getting ready to come it about scares you to death you might get scared but the word of the lord will not return void unto him if he said it's coming you can get mad because you ain't seen it yet you can get all flustered because you ain't filtered yet you can get upset because your parent ain't sitting beside you or your son or your daughter ain't sitting beside you but if the word of the lord has said it the angel will make sure that they wake that prodigal up and get up out of that hog pen [Music] i'm going to tell you what's getting ready to happen there's gonna be some prodigals that look over at the devil and say hey i changed my mind i'm not doing that no more i'm not following that sin no more i'm not going after that thing no more tell the devil how to mate up my mind and i got the mind of jesus christ no matter what it's the angel that's doing this it's the angel that's awakening it's the angel that brings the atmosphere into this place you may not see him you may not feel him but that same pillar of fire is in the building to make sure that the word of the lord has been spoken over you comes to pass [Applause] they might die they might die before you see it but jesus knows how to get people up out of the grave being four days dead it may look like there's no life there but i'm gonna tell you this same atmosphere is that this pulpit will be the atmosphere that changes my body it'll be this atmosphere that takes me into that world what a blessed people you are what a blessed people you are i've been reflecting over that i read that or made mention of that quote when brother branham said it's the hardest thing to do is to get people in the atmosphere believing in the atmosphere of worship that's been on my heart all week and i thought my jesus what a blessed people we are it ain't hard to worship god here it is hard to believe god here it ain't hard to believe for brian to completely get out of the hospital it ain't hard to believe it ain't hard to believe that cancer be drove out of our pastor it ain't hard to believe that prodigals have come back it's not hard to believe it's not hard to worship because your belief set an atmosphere this sermon is about being aware being conscious of his presence gazelle wasn't he wasn't he wasn't aware but it's aware to you that there's somebody here you ought to be convinced you ought to be concerned about these things he's here there was a sister came through a prayer line one time and and and brother brandon was praying for and i believe that that the sister had a need of arthritis in her body and brother branham said that that arthritis was caused because of acid that was in her body and and the husband was taking the the wife through that prayer line and as she took her through there brother branham said that she began to fall into a trance and brother branham just went on to the next patient but brother madam came back to that gentleman about three days after that and he began to speak to him at his front door and he he had a conversation with him and he said he said brother branham he said something something's off with my wife and brother branson what's what's going on he said ever since you prayed for something's been going on she's been in like a trance and she'd been speaking about that that there was another man that was standing at the pulpit with you and and i kept telling her no no brother branham was the only one standing there and he said we'll say that again and he said well she she said there was another man standing there this woman had never heard about the testimony about the angel meeting him in the cave but this woman began to tell that there was another man standing there that had dark hair and was wearing a white robe and said that that man that was standing behind brother branham said he kept his eyes on brother branham the whole time and he said he that man looked over at me and said you come here because you have a need and you're wanting healing he said don't you worry you go on your road believing and you'll be healed he said but look at brother branham don't he look awful frail he said but don't worry he'll be soon after a while he's brother madam said that gave me great encouragement right there and said when brother branham prayed for that woman brother branham kneeled down to pray for her but that man just kept watching brother branham that whole time and when they took her off they took her off of that off of that platform as that lady said that that man followed me all the way out the door and that was the last time i seen him oh he follows you he sees you he's going to make sure you get it you see sometimes as a minister we get concerned we think man it just went over their head or they didn't get it but when i read that this morning oh it gave me great encouragement it set a fire down in my soul that angel is going to follow you home that agent was going to make sure you believe that angel's going to make sure you get healed that angel is going to make sure that thing gets restored they say my word this ain't a man's word this is him but this ain't some angel worship we don't we don't worship the angel maybe you don't understand that maybe you don't maybe you don't grasp that holy but brother branham said he said he said we don't worship that angel he's a matter of fact he said i don't even know is it i don't even know his name he said i don't pray in his name but anytime that that angel comes it's to bring the supernatural you can look at peter and you could see that the angel came and he got him out of prison you can see when paul was on his way down to macedonia and there was a shipwreck it was the angel that came and appeared to him and you remember over in the last book of the bible in john when john the revelator had finished writing those things that john fell down and worshiped the angel at his feet but the angel said worship god you see even brother burnham said i am not he but this is a message of him this ain't some angel worship this ain't some prophet worship this is the doing of the lord it's that angel that come when you watch over in in the book of exodus and you can see in the levitical law that when they when they upset god that god sent fiery serpents down there and he began to bite the people but god made a brazen serpent and he set that up on a pole for them to look at and what was it it was an angel on that pole that when they looked up there they would see the angel of healing that sin was already judged when you look in john chapter 5 when there was a hospital set up and there were people that were laid out all across that pool at the pool of bethesda when when the bible said that at a certain season there the water began to get troubled and he that stepped in the water first received healing what was it he was an angel that was on the water it wasn't the water it wasn't brother ron's hand it wasn't brother branham's hand it was the angel that was on the water it is in my preaching it's the angel in the atmosphere it's the holy spirit that's going to make sure that you come out just the way that he destined you to be like what happened it wouldn't be it would it would be just natural if the water just kept moving the way it was you wouldn't get stirred up because of water water just kept moving the way it was but when the angel came he made it completely go the other way oh come on somebody what was it when he come by your way you were going one way in the natural you were going one way and it didn't look like you were coming it looked like you were in a pit and you would never get up out of that thing but all of a sudden the angel came and struggled the water and it began to start a holy and a completely different way you'd have still been out in sin because sin was pleasurable for a season but because the supernatural came by your way he started turning the water and when he turned the water you started running back to him brother stephen right here probably one of the greatest men that i know one of the most powerful men but i didn't i didn't go over this with you before service and i apologize and i don't mean to embarrass you but he's one of the most powerful men that said in this building he don't hardly he don't hardly he don't hardly say enough he don't hardly say enough to even even talk your ears off but let me tell you that man's got an atmosphere about him and he was so and i could pick any of you but i just decided to pick him he was in front row you want to get picked out come down here i don't think that's why he's sitting down here but here this here this man he said when he come here when he come here for the first time maybe not the first time but a few times afterwards he come to me and said brother andrew he said he said i determined in my mind that i was going to go all over these different churches and i was going to find which one had truth he said i come here and i felt something and he said i felt that this was right he said i went to other churches he said but i come back to where truth was what was it it wasn't the flesh it was a spirit that was identified that there's something laying down on the inside of that and that atmosphere of the holy ghost went by his way but ain't god good he didn't just stop it brother stephen but he went on down to sister terror when other men turned it down and they said hey i don't want nothing to do with that there sets brother greg there says brother stephen because the holy ghost is after his seed [Applause] lord help me lord help me what is it what are you looking for what are you looking for in church looking for a 15-minute sermon yeah go get it here i'm sorry you're looking for 45 minutes of worship 10 minutes of a preacherette bringing a sermonette to a bunch of christianettes you ain't gonna find it here but if you're looking for a troubling of the waters holy spirit keeps coming time and time again and telling you this is the spot you don't understand where it's at but maybe maybe you walk in here and you might forget one of these services but one of these times you just keep coming i don't get excited brother ron don't get excited because somebody walks in here and they walk away with the same type of baggage we don't get excited because we know one time one time in these waters you watch all that baggage get stripped off you watch those young people get so filled with the holy ghost that it'll make your parents get filled with the holy ghost you watch young people get on fire for god and you watch the rest of the church get on fire for god god's building a church building a church built upon the revelation of who he is [Music] let me read this let me read this quote and i'm going to bring it to a close he said truly the pool is troubled the waters are whirling backwards when a natural show in the supernatural he said the holy spirit's here taking a normal bunch of people intelligent setting here well-dressed well-educated looking and the holy spirit fall upon them and something whirls them around and they holler glory to god hallelujah what's the matter it's the troubling of the water amen sinners sitting there backsliders prostitutes drunkards and everything else are saintly godly you can't put a finger on their lives anywhere since they received it it's the troubling of the waters now now i know i know that there's a lot of people that don't understand the way you work they don't understand what makes you tick they don't understand why you worship the way you worship and they get a little bit bothered because of that they get they get bothered because all that shouting i'm dead on right here they get bothered by all that shout and they don't understand that but you see the presence of god is not shouting the presence of god is actually it's a worrisome thing it's it's a very tiresome thing the the presence of god but that shouting is the blessings of god that's coming upon the people that's being poured out it's an identifying that the holy spirit is present when you watch that people when you watch that people when they go to shouting it's identifying that the presence of god has come down and he's spoken and may go to shout what are they saying about it's the blessings of almighty god that's being poured out and you thought man alive they just excited no they getting everything they came for they looked up there in the medicine cabinet and they began to shout and said hey that's got my name on it that's i got something to shout about god decided to bless me today [Applause] you see where god is there's always supernatural because he is supernatural there's a lot of people that don't understand they don't understand the supernatural they don't understand the effects they don't understand the effects of that angel and actually some of them walk off they walk off and leave some of them turn up her nose so i don't want nothing to do with that i'll be careful what you say right there i said well i seen that person shouting and i say different on facebook i see that person shout let me tell you you watch one time when the blessings of god come down and you watch that person change be careful be careful facebook can fool you but this book will never fool you where that comes from some people get excited so hey i seen that young person they did this that and the other i i i seen that person man they got moved in that service or they got moving i'm not just talking about last service i'm talking about all services there's people that look at it and they say well hey i i don't know i see a lot of bogus people sitting there you know i see them do one thing out on the street let me tell you you come one time one good time he can turn a bogus into a reality there's a lot of people that get excited and i'm doing some pastoral preaching right here but there's a lot of people that get excited because hey they see something and they get all excited so well you know i know a little bit differently but i i remember i'm reminded when the prophet said i'd rather have a little wildfire than no fire at all let me tell you i've seen a lot of boguses too but it's only proof that there's a real one that's out there what we do the bible said that we ought to lay aside every weight and sin that does so easily beside us and run this race with patience the race that is set before us but the trouble is too many times we stop on the side of the road to see some social thing or get up mixed up with the world and some people stop and say well you know what you know what you know what i i i don't know i don't know if i can handle that i i don't know i don't know if i can do that they just stop they stop right there and say wait a minute i don't want to get fanatical about this thing i you know i'm stopping to make sure there ain't no fanatic out there brother branham said i'm more afraid of the person that's afraid than the person that's a fanatic [Applause] oh i'm a fool for jesus who's for you [Applause] hallelujah you just hang on you just hang on you just keep hanging on you see something here you don't like you just keep coming back come and see a man that told me all the things that i had done in my past has a whole lot of bogus thing in my past but you come and see a man that told me all that i did is this not the very messiah i'm not trying to preach to you something just to get you emotional and i'm not trying and i'm coming down because i i've got a lot of things i got a lot of things that people get excited about especially on the internet they get excited because they think that that preachers are just working people up that people that that brother ron surely surely brother ron had a meeting before the internet got caught on and told him that you know you ought to stand up you know you ought to just get excited about the word you know that's a devil that's a devil if your preacher had something to preach about you'd be upon your feet too it's the word that brings the people to the feet it's the word that makes them act like that it's the word that causes them to shout it's a word that causes cancer to leave it's the word it's not me it's not the preacher it's the word that drives out demons it's not the laying on of my hands but it's a promise that's behind that word [Applause] i found what i was looking for when i found jesus and to jesus i know he can heal your body he can set your mind free the jesus i know is not the god of the world but the jesus i know is good enough to save the lost the jesus i know heals cancer the jesus i know comforts the hearts he's a mender of the broken heart i believe we're very aware that there's something greater than ourselves here as the musicians come darius had to recognize that there was something a whole lot greater than just a man there he didn't tried everything and there was a woman in front of him that tried everything but one time recognizing that presence made her drop all that she had crawled through all the critics that had made fun of her she spent all of her living just to get through the physician for 12 years but one time in his presence the bible said that she was immediately made whole i i can identify with that woman i was one way but now i'm different is there a witness in this place this evening i was one way but when jesus came by my way it's different now it's different now amen give the lord praise in the house of god give myself away i give myself away oh i give myself away so you can use me i give myself away oh i give myself away so you can use me oh here i am oh lord [Music] your desires rebuilding me i keep myself away i give myself away so you can't use me i give myself away i give myself away so you can use me won't take my heart [Music] i place them in your hands i give myself away oh god i give myself away so you can use me i give myself away [Music] i give myself away so you can use me my life is [Music] i give myself i give myself to you [Music] my life is [Music] i give myself i give myself to you i give myself away i give myself away [Applause]

watches i want you to sing [Music] because i am happy [Music] well i'm free [Music] oh [Music] oh yes [Music] oh [Music] i [Music] oh [Music] well i'm so glad that jesus set me free well i'm so glad
