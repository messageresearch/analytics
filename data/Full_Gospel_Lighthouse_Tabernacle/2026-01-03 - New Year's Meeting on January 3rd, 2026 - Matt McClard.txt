It's good to be in the house of the Lord. It's good to be home. &gt;&gt; Amen. We love to go out and visit and share what God's doing and help somebody, but man, it's it's good to be home.

You know, I don't know what your need is, but there's a God that knew your need before you walked through the building. There's a God that can speak personally. He's not a far off. He's here tonight. Not only that, he loves you. &gt;&gt; So, I don't know what the devil's told you about him not loving you. Just remember, the devil is a liar. &gt;&gt; He can't stop loving you.

And may you just weave it together, Lord, as only you can, Father, that we'll just stand in awe, Lord God, of your presence, Lord God, and what you're doing in our midst, Father. God, I pray tonight, God. May you pour out your spirit, Father, and there may be healing, Lord. I cry out, Lord. I ask for fillings of the Holy Ghost, God. I ask for refillings of the Holy Ghost, Father. God, I ask that you would take this vessel of mine, God. Take this gift that you placed in my life, God, as I yield it to you, God. May you begin to work, Lord, from the front, to the back, to the right, to the left, God, and may you just minister to every need that's represented in the building, Father. And God, may we be like those on the way to Emmas, God. Did not our hearts burn with us as he talked to us along the way. God, we love you tonight, God. Take this service into thy hands. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. And amen. If you have your Bibles, we'll turn to Luke chapter 7 verse 36. I want to say thank you for all the gifts and merry Christmas and just feeling like we're one of you. Amen. We we truly love you. I want to take a take a moment to say thank you to Andrew and Ron. You guys are awesome. Matthew and William, man, it's great to be a part of this team. Amen. Amen. Luke 7:36. We'll take our text. You just pull. We'll preach as fast as we can and then we'll hand the baton. Amen. Amen. Verse 36. We'll read down through verse 50. And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisees house and sat down to meet. And behold, a woman in the city which is a sinner, and she knew not that Jesus sat at the meat, knew that Jesus sat at meat. in the Pharisees house, brought an alabaster box of ointment, and stood at his feet behind him weeping, began to wash his feet with tears, and he wiped them with her hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment. How many like to take that place tonight? And when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it, he spake within himself, saying, "This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this was that touched him, for she is a sinner." And Jesus answered and said to him,"Simon, oh, could you imagine, I have somewhat to say unto thee." And he said, "Master, say on." Look at the arrogance. There was a certain creditor which had two debtors, and one owed 500 pence, the other 50. And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me, therefore, which of them will have will will love him most? And Simon answered and said,"I suppose to him to him that forgave most." And he said unto him, "Thou has rightly judged." And he turned to the woman, and said unto her, said unto Simon, "Seeest thou this woman? I have entered into the house. Thou gavest me no water for my feet. She has washed my feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head. Thou gavest me no kiss, but this woman since the time I came in, hath not ceased to kiss my feet. My head with oil thou didest not anoint. But this woman had anointed my feet with th with ointment. Wherefore I say unto thee, her sins which are many are forgiven, for she loved much. But to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little. And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven. And they that sat at me with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also? And he said unto woman, Thy faith hath saved thee. Go in peace. You may have your seats. I started it. Amen. Want to take a text if I might by the help of the Lord. Take advantage of your opportunity. Take advantage of your opportunity. Now the word opportunity is a set of circumstances that makes makes it possible to do something. Let me catch it. Now a circumstance is this is another definition. I'm teaching for two seconds. I'm no teacher. Circumstance fact or condition connected with the reent or relevant to an event or action. So an opportunity is circumstances. And then you've got the circumstances a fact or condition connected or relevant to an event or action. Let me give you some circumstances tonight. You ready? Hebrews 6:18. He says, "Is it impossible for God to lie?" You've come tonight, but won't you take advantage of your of your opportunity to recognize it's not just Brother Matt and Brother Ron and Brother Andrew and and your brother and sister sitting beside you, but there is a guest in the building tonight. Why don't you take advantage of your opportunity and begin to worship God? If he cannot lie and he said he'd be here, then I'm here to tell you he's here. Then what kind of opportunity do you have tonight? You can leave. Well, you can leave with [screaming] the Holy Ghost. You can leave victorious. You can leave on fire for God. &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, I'm not going in this next year dwindling down. Maybe you're getting cold tonight. Well, this is your opportunity. Say, "Brother Matt, I need more of God." Listen, recognize when you're getting cold and don't stay in that condition. Why don't you say, "Father, I'm in need of some [screaming] fire on my bones." Come on. You can't stay there tonight. You're in the presence where all things change. Let me give you another circumstance. How many likes circumstances? Circumstances are facts. Oh, glory. Oh, we got some facts laying in this Bible, [screaming] saints of God. They're not to be, "Oh, that's no big deal." It's a big deal to say that God cannot lie. &gt;&gt; I'm not serving a [screaming] God that changes. The Bible said, "I am God and I change not." So if he healed back then, he'll heal today. If he saved back then, he'll save today. &gt;&gt; What do you have need [screaming] of tonight? This is your opportunity. &gt;&gt; Why don't you take advantage of it? Oh, glory. Matthew 18:20, it says, "Where two or three are gathered together in my name, can I get a witness? How'd you gather tonight? Did you gather in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ? Well, the Bible says, "I cannot lie." But he also said, "Where two or three are gathered, I'll be in the midst." &gt;&gt; So, what kind of opportunity do you have tonight? &gt;&gt; Glory. Come on. This is a simple gospel, but when we come to church, what kind of opportunity do we have? Why don't you take advantage of it tonight? You've been along fighting your battles, fighting your battles. Feel like you got no victory. Well, why don't you just begin to praise God cuz the victory's in the building. &gt;&gt; Let your tongue [screaming] go loose and take an opportunity when you don't feel like it. Give him praise anyway. Where the spirit of the Lord is. Where the spirit of Lord is. &gt;&gt; Come on. Where the spirit of the Lord is, &gt;&gt; I am God. And I changed out. And that same spirit that fell on the day of Pentecost. It's the same spirit here tonight. And he's here to give you liberty. &gt;&gt; Listen, we're not sitting in a jail cell, but a lot of you, some of you are sitting in a jail cell right here. Oh, glory. &gt;&gt; Come on. I'm coming right down your alley. The devil's the one telling you that. The devil's the one trying to hold you back. But the spirit of the Lord here is to give liberty to the thoughts that are [screaming] trying to hold you back. &gt;&gt; That's not God's word. It's a lie straight from the pits of hell. &gt;&gt; Well, glory. Where the spirit of the Lord is, there's healing. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. They would bring them in there one way and they'd leave out another. &gt;&gt; How many's went to church one way and left out another? &gt;&gt; Why? Cuz I took advantage of my opportunity. [screaming] How do I do it, brother Matt? Do I sing? Do I dance? What do I do? Let your faith go. &gt;&gt; Let your faith go. &gt;&gt; You're not getting it. Let it go [screaming] tonight. Say, "Lord, it's already mine. &gt;&gt; You paid for it. Glory. &gt;&gt; I love church. &gt;&gt; Let me give you another one. I'll never leave you nor forsake you. How many's felt forsaken when you walked through the building? Well, I'm here to tell you that was just a feeling that was straight from the pits of hell. That was a thought that the devil's trying to bring your past up. He's trying to bring your sins up. He's trying to bring your iniquities up. But let me tell you, when you go to God's book, there's no record [screaming] of it. Why are you stopping, brother Matt? There's devil's hands I'm crushing right now. [applause] &gt;&gt; You crush his head, he has a hard time talking. &gt;&gt; There'd be somebody [screaming] that would bruise his head. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. This isn't time to lay down. This is an opportunity to show what God has done in this age. &gt;&gt; He's not got a people going down. He's got a people going up. Man, it's good to be home. Why don't you go ahead and start believing for the impossible? &gt;&gt; It's your opportunity tonight. But the matter, I've never had that kind of victory. I can't have that's just what they talk about. No, that victory is for you. I'm not backing down from it. This [screaming] is your opportunity. &gt;&gt; I got to go. Here we go. Think about this Pharisee. I'm going quick now. This Pharisee, brother, picks this up and he talks about the courier coming to get him. He got so busy. The courier. I got to get there. I gota do this. Hey, hey, hey. Will you come to my party? Will you come? No, don't go with me. Stay right there. There's an example, man. It's good. Hey, look. That's a good boy right there. He been tall. Well, but the courier, he was respectful, but he didn't recognize what type of opportunity &gt;&gt; he had. He had an opportunity to speak to the King of Kings. He had an opportunity. Oh, glory. Listen, somebody. You may not recognize your opportunity, but let me tell you, the Lord Jesus is in the building and he's longing for [screaming] an opportunity to talk to you. Brother Matt, you've hit me on every point. Then recognize it's not me hitting you. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. It's not me hitting you. It's God [screaming] letting you know I'm in the building. I am discerning your thoughts and intents, [screaming] &gt;&gt; and I am speaking &gt;&gt; to your need. &gt;&gt; Don't miss your opportunity. Listen, I'm going to read these quotes real quick. And the courier bowed his head and started away. This is a sprint. His courier bowed his head and started to run away. Run away back to his master. How could he do it? What caused him to do that? Just bring the message, stand before the prince of all preaches, have an audition with him, had an interview with the king of glory, and fails to see his opportunity. You may not be the preacher, but you're sitting in a pew tonight and the King of Kings comes personal to you and he begins to say to you, "This is your opportunity." You've doubted whether you got the Holy Ghost. You've doubted whether God could heal you. You've doubted whether you could have that kind of victory. You doubted whether you could put cigarettes down. You've doubted whether alcohol could go away. But I'm here to tell you, there's a man in the building. Don't miss this opportunity. The man is [screaming] here, King Jesus. Why? Not only because he said he would, but he's here tonight because your [screaming] praise brought him down. Brother said, "Don't miss your opportunity. It's presented to every man and woman in the world daily." Catch that now. Daily. Daily. You got to take advantage of every opportunity. Listen, the devil don't want you to pick up the good old book, but take an advantage to talk to your king once again. But man, I've read it for five days straight, and I feel like I ain't got anything. &gt;&gt; He's just setting you up for day six. &gt;&gt; Woo, [screaming] that's good right there. You know what? I think the best is yet [screaming] to come. But man, I've listened to that message. It's been on my heart and on my heart. And I've listened, listen, listen. and I feel like I can't get anything from it. Listen again. [screaming] God wants to know. Will you be persevering? Take the opportunity to say, "Lord, that's your voice. I believe it." &gt;&gt; Somebody better have a Jubilee on Thursday. Somebody have a good old time in the car. Come on, somebody. Brother says, "Use every opportunity to get to Jesus." Listen to me. So many times we come in here with a need and you know you got a need. I don't know you got a need, but you know you got a need. Some of you don't realize you got a need until the guy gets preaching. Then you realize, oh goodness, that's me. That was David one time. Who are you talking about? That's you, David. Sometimes revelation comes like that and we don't like it. But what will you do with it? Will you take the opportunity to be like Saul or will you take the opportunity to humble yourself like David and say, "Father, forgive me. Have mercy." Why don't you take this opportunity to enter the new year? Get your slate clean. Ask God for forgiveness. Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; If God's been convicting you, why you sitting on it? &gt;&gt; Take the opportunity to say, "Father, forgive me, &gt;&gt; brother Matt. It's been 20 years since I've struggled with that thing." Well, tonight is different. Your faith is beginning to grow. [laughter] Think about Peter and his disciples. Don't go. You know that that guy's a Pharisee. In fact, I think he was at the last meeting. Brother Brandham called him a chubby fell. He called him a fat little guy. That's what he did. [sighs] Nothing against that. No. Take an opportunity. Look in the mirror. Well, praise the Lord. That's good for you, too. You breathe like this. There's something needs to happen. Preach, buddy. Nobody else's fault but mine. All right, hurry. Listen. Here's the thing. Peter, don't go. He don't want to hear what you got to say. He doesn't want you there. He doesn't want you there. He doesn't want you there. But here's the thing. Jesus goes where he's invited. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. He goes where he's invited. &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I'm not making him the first, second, third. I'm not making him any other place but the first place in my life. Make him the first place in your marriage. Make him the first place in your job. Make [screaming] him the first place as a husband. Make him the first place as a daddy, as a mama. Make him first place. And you watched the [screaming] blessing. You took an opportunity. Say, "Father, lead me. Guide me." There's sometimes I'm an idiot, but God, you do all things. Well, &gt;&gt; let me catch this. You never speak to Jesus unless he always gives you the opportunity. [snorts] He was He was then and is he is now. For he's longing and waiting for an interview with every person. I know about half you go, "I'm not worthy." You ain't going to get worthy, so quit worrying about it. He still wants to talk to you. After Peter made all his mistakes, he said, "Get Peter, too." &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. You'll get that in a couple days. [sighs and gasps] But catch this. No matter how faint it is, he knows every need that you have need of. Not one little prayer can be said without him knowing it. How many say, "Thank the Lord." When you didn't feel like you could really give a prayer, get down and put Lord, you're just going to have to help me. He heard that, too. And let me ask you, did he fail you? He was right there. You say, "Brother Matt, but I was expecting a light to open from heaven and [screaming] this happens." No, he doesn't in the stillness. He'll move right into your situation. Well, why don't you take this opportunity right now? Say, "Father, thank you for all my misrecks. Thank you, Lord, for my wealth. Thank you, Lord, for my health. Thank you, Lord, for where you've been." Take an opportunity right now. There was 10 lepers one time, and one of them went back and said, "Lord, [screaming] I want to cry out and say, "Thank you." Listen, what did they do? They took God at his word. Let me catch this real quick. The lepers every week they were going to the priest, going to the priest, going to the priest. Had to go get checked. And what did Jesus tell them? Go to the priest. Do you think in their mind they were like, "Are you serious? We do this all the time." But you know what? They just took him at his word and started walking. And as they were walking, the Bible says as they were walking, I know I'm preaching right now. How many's been while you're walking saw some leprosy and he just said, "Keep going to church. Keep on walking." And you look down on a Oh, glory. You look down two months later and that desire has been completely gone for your body. Well, I'm [screaming] giving you the opportunity. Why don't you return around and go thank Jesus for what he did in the quiet [screaming] walk. &gt;&gt; That's good. Think about this woman. She took full advantage of her opportunity. She heard Jesus was there. Listen, I'm going I want to hit this real quick. Don't grow complacency in this church. &gt;&gt; Spirit of the Lord moves. Praise the Lord. Yep. He's going to move. Yes, we expect God to move. But when God moves, you make sure your voice is heard. You say, "Brother man, I'm not a screamer. I ain't saying you got to scream. Make sure God [screaming] hears your voice. Thank you, Father. When I can't say the words, listen to my heart, God. I thank you for dropping the service. That sister had been struggling [screaming] forever. Lord, I'd sit on her for three weeks. I've been praying for her. And you know what God says? You [screaming] prayed and there's your answer. &gt;&gt; This woman, she had a reputation. She had problems. But she found out Jesus was going to be there. [sighs] She wasn't invited, but she wanted to get into his presence. She sold, went and got her money bag. Brother talks about it. She went and got her money bag. Let me tell you how much money that was, by the way. Between 30 Wait, hold on. I'll mess it up. Between 30 and $50,000 worth the Bible said, begin to look at this. 300 days work. She wanted to make sure he knew how important it was that I get the opportunity to get into your presence. I'm willing to give my all. Come on, somebody. When's the last time you gave a $30,000 offering? &gt;&gt; Well, preacher, brother, man, I believe I am. Amen. But when's the last time you begin to pour out your whole heart? Listen, she didn't just pour out her money bag. I'm not looking for an offering. I'm not [screaming] looking for a money. But I'm here to paint you an example. When you get in the presence of God, take advantage of it no matter what the cost. &gt;&gt; This is your opportunity. Listen, you ain't got to wait for a prayer line. You ain't got to wait on somebody to lay hands on you. You're a gentile and [screaming] you can believe as the word is going forth. This is my opportunity. I'm not waiting for somebody to touch me. I'm not waiting for somebody to pray for me. I [screaming] believe the word and it's mine. &gt;&gt; I got seven minutes. She took all she had. [laughter] I want to go to somebody else real quick. Blind Barameus. [panting] There he was. Brother Bam said he didn't have but one opportunity. Listen, young person. You know who's talking to you. Listen, old person. You know who's talking to you. Everybody in between, I catch you, too. Blind Barnameus couldn't see him. Maybe your vision is a little dim tonight. You can't see a far off. But blind Barnameus begin to hear commotion. You know where Jesus is? He's loud. I don't know about you, I like a church that enters in. Come on. I'm right at home right here. I like a church that enters in. When the word of God hits you, you say amen to it. Come on, somebody. When the word of God hits you, you say hallelujah. When the word of God hit you, say, "Glory, brother Matt." That's the truth, brother Matt. It hurt me, but that's the truth anyway. You begin to say that and you watch it. It may have hurt you then. But the next time you can shout, [screaming] "Glory." Because the same God that heard you, amen, in the word, is the same God that'll bring it to pass in your life. Blind Barnameus. There he was. They begin to pass by. I'm sure. Blind. What's going on? What? What's going on? I heard Jason. Is he here? Is he here? I can't see. Come on, somebody [screaming] help me out. Shh. He's right over there. [sighs] Blind Barnameus took advantage of his opportunity. He said, "I might be I'll be able to find him. I might stand and walk and find my way, but I'm going to begin to cry out. I'm going to begin to cry out. Brother Brandham said he was 200 yards away. So, let me paint the picture for you. Two football fields and it's loud. How many's ever been in a football field and the crowd's cheering? Some of those people that came took an opportunity to make fun of him. They took an opportunity to throw throw eggs at him. They took an opportunity to do that. But I'm not here to do any of that. I come for an opportunity to cry out to my maker and say, "Father, in 2026, it's going to get darker, but Lord, you said there'd be light in the evening time. And Father, will you shine that light through me? This is my opportunity not to go down, but to go up in Jesus Christ." &gt;&gt; Blind Barnameus, he began to cry out, "Jesus, have mercy on me." Listen, it isn't how loud your voice is. I talked about your let your face loose. Let your faith loose. You might be the one that's blind tonight. You can't see yourself walking in. You can't see your walking as a sinless, spotless bride. But let me ask you, if Jesus would give you a vision to that, he's given you [screaming] a vision of that. He's here today to let you know you are my bride. &gt;&gt; Most of us don't feel like it. &gt;&gt; Come on, go ahead and raise your hands. You're not. It means you have the You know what that is? That's nothing but the devil trying to beat you down. But he he didn't say, "Did you feel it?" He said, "If thou can't believe, all things are possible." Then why don't you start saying, "Lord, it's me. It's me in the mirror of God's word." That's the reason I can't get away from it. And father, I come tonight to get an opportunity to draw close to you. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam says, "Now faith cometh by hearing and hear the word." He knew that Jesus was come by. He would he couldn't say, "No, wait. I might see him another day. Quit putting it off. What are you waiting for? [screaming] This is your opportunity." &gt;&gt; Listen, this woman didn't care what everybody else thought about her. It's about time you stop caring what your brother thinks about you, what your sister thinks about you. There's one man in the room. [screaming] I care what he thinks. [applause] Now, if you have faith, come by hearing, hear the word. He knew Jesus come by. Now, wait, I might see him another day. I'll try tomorrow night in the next meeting. He didn't have that opportunity. That was his first and last opportunity. The only opportunity he ever had, ever would have to receive his sight. So, he had to do something. He raised and screamed at the top of the voice, "Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me. Have mercy on me." Brother Ram said there was no way he could hear his voice, but he said he felt the pressure of blind Barnameus's faith calling him. I don't know about you, but why don't you begin to press on him? Why don't you let your face say, "Father, I need a refilling." Listen, I didn't come to this weekend not to leave with something. I want a refilling of the Holy Ghost. I don't care if it happens while I'm preaching. I don't care when it happens. I want a more of God in my life. I want more of God. This is your opportunity then. What are you waiting on? A special service? This is special. [screaming] He's here. &gt;&gt; Almost done. There was a woman with an issue of blood. She had tried every opportunity to get well. She tried every opportunity. Went to every doctor, done everything they told her. But she heard he was passing by. Let me ask you, let me tell you. He's not passing by. He's here. &gt;&gt; Won't you say a little bit, Jesus? Simon may not Simon and the Pharisee didn't wake you. Welcome, but I want to. I'm crying out to you tonight, Lord. Listen. Brother Bam said this. She be to cry. Back to the woman, different woman. Stick with me. She began to cry and wash his feet. And she took her glory, all of her glory, and begin to wipe the dirt, the gunk, the manure. Come on, somebody. She wanted to make him welcome. What about tonight? This is your opportunity. Won't you press through your idea? Won't you press through your past? Come on, somebody. Won't you press through every thought that says you can't have what you want? Won't you press through it to say, "Lord, I'm coming anyway. Lord, if I can just touch, if I can feel your presence, Father, if I can get there, Lord, I know [screaming] something will happen." &gt;&gt; All right. I don't count down. Brother Matt, I have so many battles. Brother Brand would tell you, it's God giving you opportunity to have victories. &gt;&gt; So quit looking at him as you did something wrong. It's God showing, hey, you got a sword, you got a shield, you got armor. Why don't you go take that demon's head off? &gt;&gt; Listen, we may never kill 600 Philistines like Shamgar, but you have 600 thoughts that come to your mind on a daily basis. Why don't you take that [screaming] thought and cut its head off? How do I do that, brother man? I take the word and it says it doesn't line up with it. That's not what he called me to. &gt;&gt; Let me finish with this quote. Two quotes. He said she stopped. She said, "Oh, I just can't do it." This is the woman with the alabaster box. She said, "I just can't get. What would he say about a woman like me? What would he say? But here they invited him and it's my opportunity." Oh, you don't realize what an opportunity you got. You got an opportunity today, friends, to be filled with the Holy Ghost. You got an opportunity today to to be a saint of God. You don't have to be a stinker stinking sinner. You can be a saint. You don't have to be a hypocrite. &gt;&gt; He don't want no Pharisees. There's a real deal. And I know I'm looking at her. You don't have to be a church attender and not a Christian. You don't have to go along with her act and you're a Christian. You go to church, hide your meanness. You can really be a Christian. You got an opportunity. Let me face with this closing quote right here. How many loves him? &gt;&gt; But to think that it's true. One time those men were as we are here this morning. They had their opportunity and we've got ours. What are you going to do with it? You've got an opportunity to win souls. All right, everybody say amen. Ready? One, two, three. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, you got a voice. It's your opportunity to start spreading the good news. If he could save me, brother David, if he could change my life, Brother Andy, if he could change me, he can change you. Brother Matt, they don't want to hear it. I don't care if they want to hear it or not. One of these days, they'll come looking for you and say, "What were you talking about?" Brother Ron has a testimony. He was with a guy in a nitrogly factor every day. He began to witness to him every day. Every day. Every day. Five years after he left, he went back there and preached there. That guy walked from the back of the church, walked up there before the preaching. I don't need to hear any doctrine. I need Jesus. What was it? He took the opportunity to share what God has given me. Brother M. God [screaming] had given very much. He wants you to give what he gave you and he'll give you more. &gt;&gt; All right, let me stop. &gt;&gt; Let me finish right here. Oh, make every ounce of it count for the Lord Jesus. Have no times for things of the world. Lay aside every weight that does so easily beset you. And the bride says, "Let us run this race with patience. Let us set before us. Let the love of the Lord Jesus be kind to one another. Be kind to your enemies." The bride says, &gt;&gt; "They won't be your enemies. You start being kind. Don't make them your enemy. Don't give them the opportunity to be your enemy." Brother Matt, but they constantly Uhhuh. Take that circle. Love of Jesus is so wonderful. Love I got to move. It's bigger. Love of Jesus. But brother M. I got to go way out here and get him. Listen, if you got to go to the back of the church, if you got to walk to the ends of the earth to make the love of Jesus be real to somebody, then this is your opportunity. Listen. Don't wait on [screaming] somebody else to take to do what you've got to do. &gt;&gt; I'm done. &gt;&gt; I'm done. Let's stand. Are we standing? Are we sitting? What we doing? I love you, Lord. Can you see? I wait on Sister Cassie. I mean appreciates our musicians. I love you, Lord, for your mercy. Oh, [music] all my days I've been held in your hand. From the moment that I wake [music and singing] up until I lay my head, I [music and singing] will sing of the goodness [music] of God. All my life. Oh, [music] and all my life [singing] you have been faithful. [music] Oh, and all my life you have been [music and singing] so so good. With every breath that I [music] I'm able, [singing] I will sing [music] of the goodness [singing] of God. [music] I love your voice as brother Titus, Sister Reagan, Sister India as you come. [music] I love your voice. Well, [singing] you have led me through [music] the fire in the darkest night. When you [music] are close like no other. I've known you as a father. I've known you as [singing and music] my friend. I have in the goodness [singing] of God. All my life. Hallelujah. Oh, and all my [singing] life you have been faithful. [music] All my life you have been so [music] so good. With every breath that I I make, oh, I'm going to sing of the goodness [music] of God. You can be seated. The sun was darkened [music] and the heavens thundered. And [music] for a moment death had thought [singing] it conered. But it wasn't [music] over till you said it's over. Your word is greater still. The [music and singing] perfect sacrifice your body broken. As [music and singing] you restored to us what sin had stolen, haunting for [music] all you tore the [singing] veil wide open. Your power is stronger [music and singing] still. All praise, all praise [music] to the name [singing] above all names. Jesus, [music and singing] you reign cuz you're the [singing and music] name above all names. [music] You turned the grave into [singing] a new beginning. [music] Our God is risen. You're alive [singing] and breathing. [music] There's nothing that can rise against your victory. [music and singing] Your name is higher still. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Your name [singing] is higher still. And all praise, [singing] [music] all praise to the [singing] name above all names. [music] Jesus, [singing] you reign cuz you're the name [music and singing] above all names. &gt;&gt; Yes, [music and singing] you are. Yes, you are. There is no name higher. [music] There is no name greater. And the cross still [music] stands. The blood still flows. [singing] The work [music] is finished. And hell still knows that the grave is still [singing] empty. The stone is still [music] rolled. And you're still high and [singing] lifted [music] up. You're still seated on the throne. The cross still [singing] stands [music] and the blood still flows. The work is finished [music and singing] and hell still knows that the grave is still empty. The stone is still rolled [music and singing] and you're still high and lifted up. You're still seated on [music] the throne. [singing] And all praise, all praise [music] to the [singing] name above all name. Jesus, [music and singing] you reign. Adore the [singing and music] name above all names. Hallelujah. [music] Every voice will proclaim [music and singing] there is no higher name. Hallelujah. [music] H [singing] to H we will sing. There is no higher name. [music] Hallelujah. Every [music and singing] voice will proclaim there is no higher name. [singing and music] Hallelujah. Hands to [music and singing] waves we will sing. All [music] praise. All [singing] praise to the [music] name above all names. [music] Jesus, [singing] you reign. Cuz you're the [music and singing] name above all names. You're [singing and music] the name above all names. You're the [singing and music] name above all names. [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. He's the name above all names and worthy of all praise, honor, and glory. Amen. Let's stand if you will. How many happy to be in the house of the Lord? &gt;&gt; Amen. Man, I tell you what, if you can't be happy after that sermon, Brother Matt, &gt;&gt; got to take your opportunity. How many appreciated that? &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless each and every one of you. Certainly wish you a happy new year. &gt;&gt; Certainly looking forward to everything the Lord has in store. Because regardless of what happens and comes this year, serving the Lord can only be good. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. If you'll turn with me, we'll just get right in the word here. If you'll turn with me in two places, Mark chapter 11 and then in Hebrews chap 11 also we'll read Mark 11. Very familiar text here, 11:22. As you're flipping here, you know this, all the word of God is powerful. &gt;&gt; But this particular text, this particular scripture here was so deep and so powerful, the prophet wouldn't preach it for years. He couldn't understand it until God showed it to him. And then he preached it to us as the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And we can now take this scripture and make it live. Amen. 11 Mark 11:22. And Jesus answering saith unto them, have faith in God. For verily I say unto you, that whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea, and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he with which he saith shall come to pass. Not what brother Brandham said, not just what Jesus said, but what you say &gt;&gt; shall come to pass. He shall have whatsoever he saith. &gt;&gt; Therefore, I say unto you, whatsoever things ye desire when you pray, believe that you receive them, and ye shall have them. &gt;&gt; See, that's the the condition. That is the caveat is that you can have anything you ask for &gt;&gt; but you got to believe. &gt;&gt; In Hebrews 11:1, now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. There is a volume of things that were just said right there. Let's read it again. Now faith &gt;&gt; is the substance of things hoped for. It is the evidence of things that you don't see. Amen. Let's bow bow our heads and our hearts. Gracious heavenly father, we thank you, Lord Jesus, for the wonderful time we've already had in your presence. We thank you for the word that so encouraged our hearts. Father, I just pray and ask Lord that you just take your vessel Lord and just use me for a few moments Lord that it can encourage your people. We love you now. We look to you in Jesus Christ name. Amen. You may be seated. With the help of the Lord, I'd like to take a little topic here. Hope versus faith. &gt;&gt; Hope versus faith. Now, we all have things. We we've all been trusting God for things and we've trusted God for things in 2025 and some things God might have brought into manifestation. Other things we're still trusting him for. And may this year, the 2026 be the year for it. Amen. &gt;&gt; So now faith, I want to read it again. Faith is the substance of things you hope for. Now we're we're we're speaking tonight about faith versus hope. So if it's something versus something else, that means it's two different things. That's right. &gt;&gt; The faith is the substance of things you hope for, the evidence of things not seen. &gt;&gt; The prophet tells us that faith is only real to God and the one who has it. &gt;&gt; Faith is only real to God and the one who has it. Thank you, brother. Now we are a triune being soul, body and spirit. Every request we read the prayer request every single service whenever brother Matt or brother Andrew or the song leader asks how many have a have a request. Every single request we could possibly have is a need for our soul, our body, or our spirit. If it's for ourselves or maybe you're raising your hands for a loved one. &gt;&gt; If you've got a prodigal, if you've got a lost loved ones, it's for their soul. If you're facing depression, then it's for your spirit. &gt;&gt; Every need or every desire ministers to something. Now, hope is also known as mental faith. Now, I want us to understand here. I don't want to put down hope. Hope is important. The Bible teaches us that there's three things. Faith, hope, and love. But the greatest of these is love. So, hope most definitely has a place. Hope is a believer. &gt;&gt; Hope is not an unbeliever. Hope is not like Mr. skeptic or Mr. unbeliever or Mr. Makebeliever or Mr. impatience. Hope is a believer and our hope is in the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Our overall direction of life is our hope is in the Lord. If we get sick, our hope is that God is our healer. &gt;&gt; If everything is going well for you, you've got the joy of the Lord and you're on the mountain. Your hope is that if your heart gets broken, you know that God is your mener. If you're sitting here sanctified, filled with the Holy Ghost, your hope and our hope and we know and our trust is that if we sin, he's just to forgive us. That is our hope. And hope is a powerful thing. But now faith &gt;&gt; gives us access to the things that we hope for &gt;&gt; because remember as we read in the scripture, it is the faith is the substance of things that you are already hoping for. Amen. &gt;&gt; It is the evidence of things that you don't need. So faith is accessing what you're hoping for but you need at the present time. &gt;&gt; You can you our hope is in the word. This is our hope. Our hope is in the Lord. &gt;&gt; But if you're healthy then you don't need faith to be healed, do you? &gt;&gt; If you're lost, your hope is in the Lord. You need faith to be saved. That is the only way. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now listen to this quote here. He said, "Brother Bram," in the ministry explained. He said, "I find that many people come to faith in kind of a haphazard way, if you'll excuse that expression. Kind of like they're making a guess at it. And 90% of the people that comes in the line have hope instead of faith." &gt;&gt; That makes me throw my toes back in my shoes. Here you have a prophet of God with a with a discernment like the Lord Jesus Christ. And he discerns and he says 90% of people coming in the prayer line have hope instead of faith. He said now hope is one thing and faith is another. &gt;&gt; Faith is a positive sense. It's not a guesswork. You don't just imagine it. Faith is just as real as any of the other five senses and more real &gt;&gt; because it'll go in and above those five senses. He said and it serves we would see Jesus. He said faith is absolutely a substance not a hope. Faith is a is the substance of things hoped for. But when faith takes it, it becomes the substance that you hope for. See the evidence of things not seen. Remember, no one can see your faith, but you know it &gt;&gt; and God knows it. &gt;&gt; It's so real. &gt;&gt; It's so real to the person that has it, &gt;&gt; but they can't show it to anybody else. &gt;&gt; But it's so real. It brings God down to you. It it makes God real to you and your situation. &gt;&gt; It's a million miles above hope, if I can say that. &gt;&gt; Now, the definition of hope is to cherish or desire with anticipation. Now, see how that can mix us up because that can sound like faith. To want something to happen or to be true. Another another example or another definition is to desire with expectation of op of obtainment or fulfillment. You're expecting it. &gt;&gt; Hope is of God. &gt;&gt; Our hope is in the Lord. &gt;&gt; He said but the prophet of God in the third Exodus says now make believe now faith. Not make believe now faith. Not hope but faith. Hope is out there hoping it was in. Hope is expecting. God, I'm I'm expecting it. He says, "But faith is already in." &gt;&gt; Already in looking out, you've got it. &gt;&gt; Faith is your excuse me, hope is your hoping, your anticipation. God, if you can only do this for me, &gt;&gt; I know you can do it because I read it in your word. You've got hope. &gt;&gt; You're not hopeless. You've got hope. But faith says, "Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. I've got it already." &gt;&gt; He said, "Faith is already looking in, looking out, and saying it's done." &gt;&gt; See, that's faith. Now, faith is also called a key. He says, "Now Jesus is the door to all things." &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; And faith is the key that unlocks that door. Now, if Jesus is the door to all these promises of God, faith in his finished work unlocks every door to every treasure there is inside the kingdom of God. See it? Faith is the key that unlocks every promise he makes. The key of faith does that. Faith in his finished work. &gt;&gt; Now, hope is believing that it's behind the door. Faith is saying, excuse me, hope is saying everything I need is this. I need this. I'm trusting God for this. And it's behind that door. You believe it. But faith gives you the key to say, "I need it." And you open that door &gt;&gt; and Jesus is the door. &gt;&gt; You walk in there. &gt;&gt; I need healing. I need peace of mind. &gt;&gt; I need the joy of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And you come out and you've got something. &gt;&gt; It's yours. &gt;&gt; Why? Not because of you're just sitting there knocking. You take opportunity of your moment. You you unlock you get the faith that God gives you and you put the key in and you turn it. You get access behind the door. That's faith. &gt;&gt; But hope is saying, "My goodness, everything I have need of is right there. &gt;&gt; I'm so hungry and all the food and all all the all the ribeye is right behind that refrigerator door. All the vegetables, all the fruits, everything I need for nutrition, all the vitamins is right behind that door. I'm so hungry. It's all there. I know it's there and I believe it." Then put your faith and open the door. &gt;&gt; Get what you need. Now, every scripture has power behind it. &gt;&gt; In my simplistic mind, every scripture is like a little mini door. And you need something and you [snorts] see that door and every scripture is the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And you see it and you need it, grab a hold of it. &gt;&gt; Don't just say, "Well, amen. I believe it. It's there." Let it come off of there. &gt;&gt; Now, faith is a revelation. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; And when you have faith, nobody can take it away from you. &gt;&gt; No person, no devil in hell can ever talk a born again believer out of this message. &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's not just a hope. It is a faith. &gt;&gt; They've literally met God for themselves. So because the new birth is a revelation, it literally becomes a part of you. But now an intellectual believer can be swayed. &gt;&gt; Talked into the message, talked out of the message, talked into the message, talked out of the message. &gt;&gt; But a real message believer born again can never &gt;&gt; ever lose their faith. &gt;&gt; The message is not our hope. It is our faith. &gt;&gt; Real faith can never move. Remember Paul said in 1 Corinthians 12:3, "Wherefore I give you to understand that no man speaking by the spirit of God calleth Jesus a cursed and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost." &gt;&gt; Until then it's a mental faith. Until then you're saying that Jesus Christ rose from the dead because the preacher says it. because the Sunday school says it, because your parents say it, and that's the way it should be. Keep repeating it. Keep believing it. Don't lose your hope. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But whenever you meet him for yourself, brother Jeremy, then you know &gt;&gt; he rose from the dead. &gt;&gt; Now faith will bring you rest. &gt;&gt; It'll bring you a peace. The prophet tells us that the Christian faith is based solidly solidly upon rest. He said that's right. A Christian is not tossed about. A Christian doesn't run from place to place. A Christian doesn't fuss and fume and worry about things. A Christian rests. It's all over. It was all finished for the believer at Calvary. So if the Christian faith is based on rest, so is all faith, real perfect faith I'm speaking of here. Because remember, the prophet tells us that faith has its resting place on the word. &gt;&gt; It doesn't rest on our emotions. It doesn't it doesn't rest on our feelings. It doesn't rest on our symptoms. Now hope or also mental faith has got a labor to it. It can be a spiritual roller coaster. We come to church, we hear the word of God, man, we're on the mountaintop. Then we go out during the middle of the week and we face our challenges and all of a sudden the enemy attacks us and we need more encouragement and we do need encouragement. &gt;&gt; We do need encouragement. That's why we come to the house of God. But hope is a labor. You we it it makes us have to constantly keep ourselves in the right channel. Our ups and downs affect our faith. &gt;&gt; Your mood, our moods are affected by the circumstances, by our senses, by by by by how how our days going. &gt;&gt; Faith can be around every bit of that and still be at peace and immovable. &gt;&gt; Faith does not is it's not that well, you have faith and you're and you're feeling bad and your senses are declaring that you're feeling bad. Faith is not saying, "Oh, you know, I'm I'm not actually coughing." It's thanking God for healing you while you're coughing. &gt;&gt; Faith has a rest. You're not sidetracked by situations, circumstances. Paul tells us in the scriptures to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved and thy house. &gt;&gt; What are we to do with our prodigals and lost loved ones? Commit them to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; You have faith. Say, "Lord, they're yours." &gt;&gt; You know, when Jesus went home with Zakius, he didn't preach to him. &gt;&gt; He let Z Jesus let his own atmosphere &gt;&gt; do all the preaching. &gt;&gt; And what did Zakius say? He said he said that he he was changed. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Everything I've ever stolen, I'll give back." Now the success of brother Ram's first and second pull was hinged on people believing that he was sent from God. Get the angel told him get the people to believe you and not even cancer can stand in your way. That's why the gift was sent. It was not the gift itself brother and sister did not heal anybody. It elevated their faith &gt;&gt; to make them aware to seize their opportunity to that they were in the presence of God and that's what would heal them. &gt;&gt; Remember Jesus God himself could not do in in Matthew 13:58 and many mighty works he could not and he did not many many mighty works because of their unbelief. &gt;&gt; It all comes down to your faith. That's how people lost their healing and turn into critics. They'd come, they they would witness the presence of God. They would reach out and touch God. Their blinded eyes would come open. They would leave. They maybe get sicker and they would start backing up. &gt;&gt; And it came right up on them. Faith is only real to God and the one who have it has it. Now, let me say this right here. Never judge or criticize somebody for an extended trial, sickness, or situation &gt;&gt; or condition because you don't think they have enough faith. &gt;&gt; They could be having more faith than you have. &gt;&gt; Because remember, faith is a rest. Whenever whenever you really believe God and you've got faith that's going to happen, the time element all of a sudden is not so important anymore because you know it's done. Whenever God does it, he's going to do it. My worrying, my fredding, my my anxiety is over. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So don't judge Brother Ron because he takes chemo. &gt;&gt; Don't judge Brother Ron because he goes to doctors. He's got faith. [applause] You look at Abraham called the father of our faith. He waited for 25 years. In the in the Bible, Paul said he got stronger. &gt;&gt; Well, today, this is the second year, and he's been testifying that he and Sarah are going to have a baby. Abraham ain't got no faith. He's lying. &gt;&gt; And the spirit of God said he got stronger. &gt;&gt; As soon as God promised Abraham, he began to make doctor arrangements. He got the crib and the baby room ready. He began to testify that he was going to be a father of nations. &gt;&gt; When God spoke to him and told him that that was Abraham's sacred says &gt;&gt; and one day an angel passed through the neighborhood [applause] &gt;&gt; and confirmed the word that Abraham believed. &gt;&gt; You keep believing. You keep holding on. &gt;&gt; You be at rest. You let your faith rest in his word. And one day an angel is going to come through your neighborhood and confirm exactly what you've been believing, what you've been testifying the whole time. [applause] Now, in this great in this great faith chapter, Peter uh Paul, excuse me, speaking here says in 11:13, "These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them a far off, and were persuaded of them and embraced them." Died in faith. I thought faith. Yes. Abraham confessed that he was seeking a city &gt;&gt; whose builder and maker was God. Well, how could he confess such a thing? Because he met the king of the city. &gt;&gt; And when he went from this world into the next, he actually went there. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The same faith that he had to to to bring Isaac to reality, he met the same king. Job died in in faith and said, "Though the skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God." Joseph died in faith. Said, "God's going to visit you, and when he does, bring my bones out of here." When Jesus knocked on the door of paradise, they all recognized him because they died in faith. Brother Ron is taking the medicine in faith. &gt;&gt; He's going to the doctor office in faith. Sister Wanda takes the took the medicine in faith. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham died in faith. God didn't take him home because he didn't have enough faith for a rapture. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That was God's a lotment. His work was done and God took him home. The &gt;&gt; woman with the blood issue, she got a personal revelation in her heart that if she could just touch the hem of his garment. She'd heard about the miracles and it gave her hope. But one day it was revealed to her in faith, I got to touch him. She didn't have any scriptural examples, but it was personally revealed to her that regardless of what anybody said, regardless of all the social stigma of her of her condition, she had to touch him. And she knew that if she could only touch him, &gt;&gt; she would be healed. &gt;&gt; She didn't need anyone to acknowledge her. It even took Jesus by surprise. &gt;&gt; He was going to lay hands on Jaras's daughter. Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you can imagine I can just imagine a crowd kind of parted open and he's going through and if and if you can just go back in time and look and you see people oh master come this way and the critics and all of a sudden you see a hand &gt;&gt; just touch him draw back. She didn't need a notoriety. She didn't need anybody to pat her on the back. She didn't need a big bugle horn to say this lady touched you. She's got faith. She was getting she felt within herself that it stopped &gt;&gt; and she was getting ready to leave and Jesus says somebody touched me &gt;&gt; all the thousands and of people there and hundreds of hands that were touching him. He said somebody touch me. No prophet told her to do that. No scripture even told her to do that. That is how powerful brother Doug faith is. &gt;&gt; Nobody had to prop her up, had to pump her up, had to keep her up. &gt;&gt; She heard of all the miracles that he did. And she had hope. &gt;&gt; But she needed more than hope because she only had a certain amount of time to live. She needed faith. Now, I'll say this. If you've been when you when you've been walking with God and you've experienced some things, [snorts] you have hope. But then when when one day maybe at the preaching of a word, at preaching of the word, &gt;&gt; hearing of the word of maybe hearing the prophet or hearing one of these brothers preach, you can feel a transition. &gt;&gt; And it's so powerful. Now remember, we're not to judge one another. We're to judge ourselves. Lord, am I in hope &gt;&gt; or am I in faith? [snorts] &gt;&gt; And whenever whenever whenever God really drops something in your heart, you can feel the transition. You've got it. &gt;&gt; You can't show it to anybody, but you've got it. [snorts] &gt;&gt; There's symptoms. There's voices all around. There's no all the all of the all of your reasoning would tell you it's not possible. &gt;&gt; But you've got it anyway. &gt;&gt; That's right. Come on. &gt;&gt; It is an evidence that you can't see with your natural eyes. &gt;&gt; It is an evidence that you can't show somebody else. But that evidence, sisters too, will draw God right down. to your situation. &gt;&gt; Just like the prophet of God whenever he he had filio love and he loved everybody. But whenever the maniac came up there to knock &gt;&gt; him to kingdom come as we would say, he said, "I felt something change &gt;&gt; from just a humanistic love." He felt the agape love just step in. Now, we know, and I'm trying to wind this up. I'm running out of time. We know as message believers that thus sayeth the Lord has never failed. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; If brother Brandon was standing right here behind this pullpit right now and proclaimed thus sayaeth the Lord over your life, no matter how bad your circumstance, your situation would be as message believers, we would believe it, wouldn't we? &gt;&gt; No matter how bad. But you see, perfect faith gives you the same assurance. &gt;&gt; That's what I'm trying to say to you. Perfect faith, real faith, is thus sayaith the Lord personally revealed to you &gt;&gt; about any situation. When you have thus sayeth the Lord, you're at rest. &gt;&gt; Oh, you don't have to struggle anymore. One day in service I was we had the chairs up here, you know, and Rebecca was getting of age as a teenager [snorts] and she was a good girl, always has been. But we knew she needed an experience with God. And [snorts] she was she was on our hearts. Gabriel man's heart. And we've been praying. We've been praying for we've been praying for. And brother Andrew was up here preaching. And he was preaching about the Memphis girl. And without even realizing what he was doing, he he just spun around. He said, "Don't you worry about your daughter. She's going to find her father." I heard because of what was on my heart and and and what I was praying for and the hope that I had when I I heard I heard the voice of God. I didn't hear brother Andrew. I heard the voice of God and that settled it for us. &gt;&gt; That settled it for us. &gt;&gt; And several months later again, Brother Andrew preaching, God gave her the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; But after I heard that word of the Lord to me, it settled it. I didn't worry. We didn't worry about it no more. We were at rest. [applause] It gives you a peace that passes all understanding. &gt;&gt; How do we get more faith? Paul said, "Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God." But it's not the hearing we do with our ears. It's the hearing we do with our heart and soul. It's the same kind of hearing that Jesus said, "He that has ears to hear, let him hear what the spirit saith to the to the church." A few weeks ago, I was listening to Brother Brandham and just kind of going through some things and I could literally feel faith going straight to my soul. not not as background noise or you know and and things and and and that's one thing but it was I could feel you know when we hear the prophet we believe it but this was a special moment where I could feel faith &gt;&gt; brother Thomas coming off through the speakers into my heart I could feel it coming in &gt;&gt; faith cometh by hearing &gt;&gt; I'd like to close it with this quote God has no substitute for his word. It's eternal and forever. God has no nothing to substitute faith. Faith has no substitute. Hope will never take the place of faith. Faith is alone. It stands alone. Hope can never take its place. Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. See, hope is one thing and faith is another. Hope hopes for it. Faith has got it. One is intellectual faith and the other is a direct revelation of God. It'll never take its place. When God gives you a faith on the matter, it's God's gift to you. Just like revel the revelation of this message, of this word, Brother Gabe is God's gift to you. cuz other people hear it and they don't get it. &gt;&gt; So if you've got something, we're going into this next year. We already are. And you're trusting God and you got a list of things. God, I want to see this one saved. I want to see I want this for myself. I want you to heal me and all these things. Pray that God anchors such a faith. And if your faith is to come up and get prayed for and we'll lay hands on you to fulfill the scripture, then just let that be the spot. If your faith is to where you can just hear the word and receive it, let that be your spot. &gt;&gt; If your faith is to come to an altar and give your heart to God, let that be the spot. If your faith is to just hear the word and you're in your car and you hear and and you just give your life to God, let that wherever the spot is, &gt;&gt; let it be real faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's send to our feet. There's that song, it's already done. &gt;&gt; The battle is over. The victory's been won. It's already done. I'm already healed. &gt;&gt; My family is sealed. &gt;&gt; The battle is over. The victory is already done. My family is sealed. Before I turn the service back to brother Andrew, let me say, "Brother William, why don't you ever sing?" Bible [snorts] says, "Make a joyful noise unto the Lord." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It does. [snorts] Brother David also says to play skillfully. &gt;&gt; So, I'm going to go over there and make a joyful noise unto the Lord. I'm going let brother Andrew and these musicians play skillfully &gt;&gt; and praise the Lord. Amen. God bless you. We love you. [applause] [applause] Oh, it's already done. Oh, it's already done. [music] Oh, [singing] the battle [music] is over. The victory is won. Oh, it's already [singing] done. I'm already healed. [music] Let faith say it. Oh, I'm already [singing] here. [music] Oh, [singing] I'm already here. [music] The battle is over. The [music] victory is won. Oh, I'm already healed. [music and singing] Oh, my family is [music and singing] here. Oh, [singing] my family is here. Oh, the battle [singing and music] is over. The victory [singing] is one. The family [music] is sealed. It's already done. As brother Ron Vess makes his [music] way. Oh, it's already done. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's already [music] done. Oh, [singing] the battle [music] is over. The victory [music and singing] is won.

Oh, the battle [music] is over. [singing] The victory is won. It's already [music and singing] done. The Bible says in Matthew 18 and [music] 19 as they play that again I say unto you that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching [music] anything that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my father which is in heaven. for where two or three are gathered [music] together in my name, there I am in the midst of them. We've already [music] heard two powerful services, powerful sermons, powerful statements, powerful announcements. [music] And this is just a little bit different how I was just waiting on the Lord for this moment. And uh we've already heard to take advantage of a moment. And faith [music] is going to just step into the door. And it depends on what kind of faith you got, what you walk out with. [music] Brother Ron had called me uh last week or a week and a half ago and [music] and the Lord had placed on his heart to have a special prayer for brother Ron. And I said, "Well, brother, the Lord's laid some to do the same thing on my heart." [music] And uh we'd like to have special prayer and I just feel like this is the right moment after hearing [music] hearing this powerful message on faith just to have all the brothers if they wouldn't mind just coming down. We'll have brother Ron and I'm going to invite brother Ron to just pray over brother Ron. He feels led to do that and all of all the [music] brothers if they wouldn't mind brother Ron just come down just pray for our brother. Heat. Heat. [music] [music] Heat. Heat.

[music] So in 2026 we just want to encourage you take [music] every advantage &gt;&gt; of every time every moment that you get with him for he is faithful. He's faithful to meet each [music] and every one of your desires here. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. This evening, I would like to turn to First Corinthians 15:51 and just take a little thought here just for a moment. I want to keep that same atmosphere, that same presence that's here this evening. I don't want to take anything away. I just want to have a word that would just encourage you to add on to what these fine men of God has ministered to you this evening. Verse 51 says, "Behold, I will show you a mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we shall be changed in a moment, in a twinkling of an eye, at the last trump. For the trump shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. &gt;&gt; For this corruption must be must put on incorruption, and this mortal must be put on immortality. So when this corruptible shall put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, death is swallowed up in victory. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. Oh death, where is thy sting? Oh grave, where is thy victory? The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law. But thanks be to God, &gt;&gt; which giveth the victory through who? &gt;&gt; Our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye steadfast, &gt;&gt; unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord. For as much as ye know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our heads. Dear heavenly father, Lord, Lord, we're asking you that you'll just lift these words off the pages, Lord. Lord, we can hear them. We can feel them, Lord, but we want them to become living in us, God. No, God, as I speak, God, you just let me step aside. You fill this vessel, Lord, and speak to the people here this evening. Bless them, Lord. Lord, for every effort they've made to be here this evening. Everyone that's put aside things, Lord, we we worship you this evening, God. We thank you in the name of Jesus Christ. And you can be seated [snorts] at this time. Tonight I want to take uh my text from be ye steadfast. We have Paul here that is uh writing to the Corinthians the resurrection of Jesus Christ. For we have our hope in this. Therefore, my beloved brethren, he's speaking to them in a personal sense. &gt;&gt; He loves them. &gt;&gt; Be ye steadfast where we're taking our text. Unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord. For as much as ye know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord. We're into this new year, 2026. 2025 is faded. It's gone. There is nothing else that we can do in 2025. But there is things that we can do in 2026. &gt;&gt; We can be steadfast in the Lord. &gt;&gt; Many people will talk about new goals. Many people will talk about new strengths, new beginnings. But most of us did not come out of 2025 with strengths. We came out tired, worn down, grieving, still waiting on answers, still fighting sicknesses, &gt;&gt; still carrying burdens from 2025. They did not disappear at the strike of midnight. &gt;&gt; We still have all of those things. &gt;&gt; As the Corinthians church, they was fighting against false teachings and things. And Paul would stand there and teach them the gospel, the way you should be, the resurrection of Jesus Christ, this hope that we have. Be ye steadfast, brethren. He's encouraged them in the Lord. I want to encourage you in the Lord this evening. Be ye steadfast through 2026. &gt;&gt; Things might not always go our way, but be ye steadfast. &gt;&gt; In high school, we had this program for football. It was bigger, faster, stronger. Bigger, faster, stronger. We wanted to be bigger, faster, stronger the next day, the next week, the next month. We was planning ahead to be bigger, faster, stronger. Now, I'm not talking about being bigger, faster, stronger in the gospel at this moment. I'm talking about you being steady. There's a lot of people that will come to the the Lord. They'll be like a a fire on a windy day just blowing then. That's what exactly we want to be. But the thing is is you need to be steadfast through it. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of them. I've seen them that we've had guys come here two weeks they're ready to preach. They've been out to the bar two weeks ago, but they're ready to preach two weeks from now. Now, that's good. But two weeks later, they wasn't even in church. &gt;&gt; They weren't steadfast. &gt;&gt; They didn't really catch it. I'm telling you, be steadfast. &gt;&gt; Now, I want to tell you, steadfast is not stagnant. Steadfast is moving. Steadfast is holding true. &gt;&gt; Amen. Stagnant gets wiggle tails. Stagnant is where bass fish are. I I think the devil's a bass fisherman because he likes stagnant still water. He likes Christians that don't really have something that move them. &gt;&gt; But see, we're looking for that rainbow trout, &gt;&gt; that little nibble, that little nimble. And here we go. We got you. &gt;&gt; The rainbow trout. That's what God's looking for. &gt;&gt; Amen. Stagnant is doing just bare minimum. just barely getting by. &gt;&gt; It's not steadfast. &gt;&gt; We don't want to be stagnant believers. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We're steadfast believers. Unmovable, unshakable on this gospel. &gt;&gt; Steadfast is not flashy. It's not loud. It's faithful. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Faithful, loyal, consistent, staunch. Steadfast is steady, unwavering course in love, allegiance on your convictions. It's resolute, a firm determination to adhere to the cause of purpose. We have a purpose and that is in Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just as I was saying, the Corinthians church had to fight false teachings and things of this age. You have to fight false teachings. You have to go through things. There is things at your doorstep, America. You might have seen martyrs and people across seas and things that would have happened and you said it may never be here, but I want to say it's at your doorstep, America. &gt;&gt; It's at your doorstep, Christians. &gt;&gt; You will fight things, so you better be steadfast in the gospel. &gt;&gt; Be ye steadfast, holding true to this word. Brother Brandham would say it like this. And he swore by himself, which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, not wavering about in every doctrine, every wind tossed about, from one side to another, taking sides over here, taking sides over here. Don't don't know where you stand. The Bible said, "I would that ye be established." Not saying, "Well, that I'm this today and I'm something else tomorrow." Anchor your soul in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Be born again. &gt;&gt; The life of God living in you and you know beyond a shadow of a doubt that you've passed from death unto life. &gt;&gt; Your whole hopes is built upon yonder Calvary. The love of God pours through your heart and you believe every word that God says is truth. You're willing to die for any phase of it. Be willing to die for this gospel. &gt;&gt; See what I mean? Steadfast and sure. Don't be something tomorrow. Don't be something today and then be something tomorrow. Be steadfast on the gospel here. &gt;&gt; Amen. Steadfast does not mean unbroken. Paul didn't say, "Be ye unheard." &gt;&gt; He says, "Be ye steadfast." &gt;&gt; Steadfast people still feel pain. I still feel pain. I come out of two back surgeries in 2025. I still feel some pain, but I'm still steadfast that I have my healing. &gt;&gt; Amen. I have that faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But don't let go of God. &gt;&gt; In the expositions of the church ages, it says, "Now before we close, I want to bring this thought. All along we have been talking about that seed of wheat being buried, then sending up two shoots, then the tassel, and then the true ear. This might make some of you wonder if if we said that the Lutherans didn't have the Holy Spirit just because they taught basic justification. And it might make some of you wonder about the Methodists, etc. No sir, we're not saying that. We're not talking about the individuals or the people, but the age. Lutheran had the spirit of God, &gt;&gt; but his age is not the age of full restoration &gt;&gt; by another outpouring like in the beginning. It was the same with Wesley, Booof, Knox, Wakefield, Bernard, Jonathan, Edwards, Mueller, etc. Surely we were surely they were full of the Holy Ghost. Yes, they were certainly were. But the age in which each was not the age of restoration. Neither was the age but this last age the age of complete blackout of apostasy. This is the age of apostasy and this is the age of full of restoration. It is the age of the finished cycle. Brother Brandham was saying here this is the age of the apostasy age. This is the age of complete blackout. And he would say it as he would go down through all of the church ages and it would come to that last church age and it would be completely dark and then it would just say just put a little bit of darkness in there, a little bit of light in there. You are that light. We are in the age of apostasy, a dark age. But let me tell you, he doesn't finish with that. He says this is the age of restoration. &gt;&gt; The age of restoration for the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. They couldn't do it in Wesley's age. &gt;&gt; We weren't there. &gt;&gt; They couldn't do it in Martin's age. We weren't there. We're not saying they didn't have the Holy Ghost to be able to take a rapture, but we had to finish our phase. &gt;&gt; We have to finish our cycle. We have to be steadfast on this word, on this age. &gt;&gt; It's going to be dark. Darkness has tried to creep in in every every step of the light way. It's tried to sweep in in every pullpit of this bride, but it will not creep in in this pull pit. It will be truth until the end time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In limitations 3 and22 and 23, it says, "It is of the Lord's mercies that we are not compass consumed because his compassions fail not." &gt;&gt; They are new every morning. For great is thy faithfulness. Oh, thank you, Lord. Can you just say, "Thank you, Lord, for your faithfulness to me." &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Great is thy faithfulness. Great is our God. Yes, you may be ill in treatment. Yes, you may be praying over loved ones, grieving over your buried. but believing for healing and staying steadfast. Don't bend, &gt;&gt; don't break. Steadfast is faithfulness in ordinary days. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hey, we're country people here. &gt;&gt; We ain't a bunch of city slickers. We &gt;&gt; We know how to get our hands dirty. We go through things. As families, you go through things, &gt;&gt; but stay steadfast. Steadfast is getting up and doing what needs to be done. &gt;&gt; Showing up even when you don't feel like it. &gt;&gt; There's many times our pastor gets behind this pull pit. He may not feel like it, &gt;&gt; but what an example of being steadfast, &gt;&gt; being steadfast on the battlefield. [applause] &gt;&gt; I could say it like many troops said. There's Stonewall Jackson standing in the field. There he is standing as an example. &gt;&gt; We have a true example of what steadfast looks like. &gt;&gt; Steadfast, always abounding in the work of the Lord. It's everyday obedience. It's steady in planting. It's trusting God with results you may not see yet. Steadfast is healing is slow. Some prayers don't get answered quickly. Some miracles take some time. Some healings come in stages. And some some don't come the way we hoped. In Isaiah 26 it says, "Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trustth in thee." All the things you're going through, he trustth in you. Trust ye in the Lord forever. For in the Lord Jehovah is our everlasting strength. &gt;&gt; Everlasting everlasting strength. It didn't say partially. It said your everlasting strength. &gt;&gt; We've heard it said before. God's delay is not God's absence. &gt;&gt; There's many prayers that we have sent up that we go, Lord, why aren't you answering them now? &gt;&gt; But let me reassure you, God's delay is not God's absence on the situation. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] We know God has a time and a place for everything. &gt;&gt; Many times we want to be like farmers, but we want to pick up and look at what's growing. &gt;&gt; We'll plant it. Turn around. Did you do anything? &gt;&gt; Nope. It's still not growing. You put it back in the ground. Well, if you continue to pull it back and you go, it's not going to grow. When you ask God to move on a situation, God's going to turn his ear and he's going to answer the situation on how he sees fit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I would have loved to have had the walked into the doctor's office, my first back surgery, and the doctor go, "Well, there's nothing wrong with you. &gt;&gt; Well, you're healed. &gt;&gt; I I don't know." But it didn't happen that way. Many times what we go through is a testimony of our trials to someone else. &gt;&gt; A testimony that says you can continue on. You can go through this. You can overcome this. &gt;&gt; So God says keep believing. Keep praying. Keep trusting. Keep showing up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's going to be days that you don't feel like getting in the car going to church. There's going to be days when you ache and you hurt and your family's sick. &gt;&gt; No. If they're flu sick, now you keep them home. We'll pray for you. You stream. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We believe in the anointing going through that web. Hallelujah. [applause] &gt;&gt; But there's days that you don't feel like it. &gt;&gt; That's right. ba days that you got to have to take a step in faith &gt;&gt; in the rapture and I'm going to be coming to a close here. Brother Brandham is getting a preview of the bride. &gt;&gt; He says, "And I remember that night. Therefore, I seen that I seen the preview of the bride. I stood there seen a beautiful little lady just correctly dressed things marching this way. There was somebody standing by me in the vision and I seen and they said the preview of the bride and I seen her go by and they come up this side and went around and I heard it coming and the church is coming from this other side and there come the Asian church. Oh, talk about filth. Here come the European church. Oh my. And then I heard the rock and roll coming and it was Miss America the church. And she didn't have a any clothes on. She had papers like newspapers gray holding in front of her dancing by the rocking and roll Miss America the church. And I stood there in the presence and I thought, "Oh God, as a minister, if that's the best we can do, oh, you don't know how he feels." Then I thought, God, hide me if I could just get away from here. If all that I've done that's that I've produced, if that's what and then when them women passed by, all them doing kinds of rocks and things, short hair, painted face, and they passed by like that, supposed to be virgins of Christ. And when they passed like that, I turned my head, you know, and with this holding in front of me and and it was a disgraceful on the back of them and there they was going like like that and I turned my head weeping like that and I said I couldn't stand it in there and him standing there and me you know as a minister of the church and that's what I had produced for him and I said oh God I can't look at it. Let me die. Let me just fade away like that. And as soon as I went out, every time one of them would come and they'd go out a certain place and then they just drop off. And I just hear the sound of it as it went away. And then I heard something like onward Christian soldiers. And I looked and here come the sainted bunch of little girls just exactly the way they was. All correctly dressed, their hair hanging way down and their back smooth and clinging and marching like this to the step of the gospel. She was the word. They looked like one out of every nation. And I was looking at it as they passed by. And I seen them pass. And instead of them going going down, they started going up. &gt;&gt; And I noticed them trying to one or two of them trying to get out of line. And I started screaming, "Stay in line. Stay in line." And the vision left me. And there I was standing screaming, "Stay in line. Stay in line." So little bride I want to tell you this evening. &gt;&gt; Stay in line. [applause and cheering] Your promise is not over. Stay steadfast. Stay in line, little bride. You're not going to be going down, but we're going to be taking a step. We're going to be taking a step upward. Staying steadfast on the word of the Lord that God has given us. Stay steadfast in what he's given us. Oh, everything that God had, he poured into Christ. And everything that Christ had, he poured into his church. &gt;&gt; Oh, he poured into you, little bride. Everything that was in him is in you this evening. Stay steadfast on the word. Oh, can you just give him praise in the house of God and say, "Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord, for standing with me, staying with me. When I thought all hope was lost in the darkest of times, you were steadfast with me. He was steadfast so I can say steadfast. &gt;&gt; Oh, let's sing that song. He's faithful to the end. He's faithful to the end with us all. Lord, when I'm feeling [music and singing] afraid, full of uncertainty. When the plans that I [music and singing] made all fall apart when the future's unclear way, there [music] is a promise echoing in my heart [singing] that he [music] will be faithful to the end. He will provide [music] [singing] time and time again. He will be faithful. So faithful [music] to [singing] the end. When [music] all else is fad, his love is stronger than my [singing] pain.

I got my name attached to the promise. [applause] Woo! [cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; There's a woman that sings a song. A Christian artist sings a song. There's a miracle in the room and it's got my name on it. &gt;&gt; I ain't got near enough voice to sing that song. But I do know this. There's miracles in this room that's got my name on it. And there ain't no devil in hell &gt;&gt; going to take it away from you. &gt;&gt; I feel so electrified right now by the presence of the Lord. Brother Paul and Sister Husani, there was a miracle in the room and it had your daughter's name all over it. &gt;&gt; And wasn't age or no doctor or nothing going to keep it out of the room? And tomorrow morning, we're going to dedicate their little baby. [applause] &gt;&gt; Let me say this. There's a breakthrough in this room. Does it have your name on it? &gt;&gt; There's deliverance in this room. Does it have your name on it? &gt;&gt; I wish it was my turn to preach tonight instead of waiting till tomorrow. So, I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll let them go again if they want to. My goodness, &gt;&gt; what a time we've had down here. Full Gospel Lighthouse Tabernacle. Woo! Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [applause] &gt;&gt; I'm younger than these guys, but boy, I sure couldn't be more proud of them. When I grow up, [laughter] when I grow up, Lord, let me be a preacher like him. Aren't you proud of the ministry that the Lord's given us here at Full Gospel White House? Give these brothers a great big hand tonight. [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; I'm going to let y'all be dismissed cuz I got a shout on the inside of me that I'm afraid that if I let it loose, y'all might be here till midnight. So, I'm going to let y'all be dismissed cuz I I know that some of y'all y'all ain't got all that in you right now. So, I'm going to say, "God bless you." And y'all pray for the young boy tomorrow. And I'll come out the barn maybe just kicking a little bit, just a little bit. Maybe I'll get the door wide open so big daddy can come running right through it. [applause] Woo! Hallelujah. [applause] Look what the Lord's done. &gt;&gt; Look what the Lord has done. Amen. We're going to let you be dismissed tonight. I I know that you got the same heart that I do that you would love to rejoice all night. But we do realize that these bodies, they need rest and I need to prepare something after these guys. So maybe I'll do like brother Donnie and I'll dig over in the maps and find something. So God bless you tonight. We love you with the love of the Lord. Tomorrow morning services at 11:00 you be remembering us in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. God bless you. Amen. &gt;&gt; [music]
