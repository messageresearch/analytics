[59:41] wow wow
[59:45] and I'm not even preaching
[59:48] I bless you you can be seated
[59:51] I'm so honored to to be able to stand
[59:54] before you today
[59:57] we love you with all of our hearts
[1:00:03] I thank you for every prayer
[1:00:07] every prayer
[1:00:11] brother Timothy stirred up the devil
[1:00:14] last night and I had to fight him so
[1:00:16] last night and so
[1:00:20] it's quite a journey
[1:00:23] it's quite a journey from diagnosis to
[1:00:25] chemo every day for two and a half years
[1:00:29] and we're still standing
[1:00:32] [Applause]
[1:00:46] you know sometimes when it's cancer in
[1:00:48] just a small spot it's a you know
[1:00:50] something that's very treatable and you
[1:00:53] can fight it for a while and maybe six
[1:00:55] months and it goes away but when they
[1:00:57] tell you that you've got it in your
[1:00:58] lungs and your brain
[1:01:00] and then they tell you for months after
[1:01:02] months and still tells me that it's not
[1:01:04] went away but it's stable
[1:01:07] you know that devil would like to take
[1:01:08] our lives
[1:01:11] and he would
[1:01:13] if he could
[1:01:25] the strength of your prayers and the
[1:01:27] strength of the Lord
[1:01:28] the doctors always tell me they're very
[1:01:31] phenomenal doctors that have taken care
[1:01:33] of us for these two and a half years
[1:01:35] they have told us that
[1:01:38] your God and this chemo
[1:01:42] I always add this chemo
[1:01:44] one of them told me the other day
[1:01:46] brother Terry that
[1:01:48] I'm their number one testimony so anyway
[1:01:52] and so we just thank the Lord for that
[1:02:02] I'd like to thank you for coming
[1:02:05] this is more than just a tradition but
[1:02:07] it's a gathering of the Bride
[1:02:10] I believe that we're just before the
[1:02:11] coming of the Lord
[1:02:14] I am told I'm told by many many
[1:02:17] different ones that a man's character is
[1:02:20] known by his friends
[1:02:23] and if you look around the room the most
[1:02:26] powerful people on the Earth
[1:02:28] are set near you
[1:02:42] so when the devil tells you that you're
[1:02:44] a nobody just tell him the circle that
[1:02:48] you set in
[1:03:07] we are a privileged people because we
[1:03:10] have some of the most powerful preachers
[1:03:12] that have ever lived on the face of the
[1:03:14] globe that are preaching for us
[1:03:17] because the open book has been given and
[1:03:19] it stands it's not limited in its power
[1:03:27] and we're a people that can receive it
[1:03:29] and rejoice in it
[1:03:31] and we love it with all of our hearts
[1:03:34] there's no breaks on it we love it it's
[1:03:37] our book
[1:03:39] it's our Redemption and we stand in it
[1:03:48] I'd like to share a testimony with you
[1:03:50] if you if you would this this is going
[1:03:51] to be my first time sharing it in this
[1:03:54] form
[1:03:55] about 20 years ago
[1:03:58] I had finished a meeting and
[1:04:02] and as the meeting was over with they
[1:04:05] rushed me to the airport
[1:04:07] they put me on the plane I hadn't even
[1:04:09] been able to change clothes when they
[1:04:11] got to the desk the the the person at
[1:04:15] the desk told me said we're sorry your
[1:04:16] plane has been canceled we're going to
[1:04:19] actually change you to a different a
[1:04:21] different company and you're going to
[1:04:23] fly this evening with that company they
[1:04:25] have one seat left
[1:04:27] it was a window seat
[1:04:30] I sat down in the window seat and
[1:04:33] I was sitting there I was wore out from
[1:04:36] the meeting I had spoke I think four
[1:04:37] days
[1:04:38] I was wore out and I was sitting in that
[1:04:41] window seat I was
[1:04:43] I was tired and I was weary
[1:04:46] and it was a man sitting beside of me
[1:04:49] seemed to be a bit talkative it was a
[1:04:52] bigger sort of fella
[1:04:54] another man sitting on the aisle seat
[1:04:56] and he had a magazine in his hand he was
[1:04:58] looking at it
[1:05:00] it wasn't just only just a little small
[1:05:03] flight maybe a couple of hours
[1:05:05] and it was getting toward the end of the
[1:05:07] flight and the fella sitting in the
[1:05:09] middle seat he said by the way what do
[1:05:11] you do
[1:05:12] I said well I'm a preacher
[1:05:15] and he said preacher he said what do you
[1:05:18] preach I said I didn't have wrong to
[1:05:20] fool with him because we were we were
[1:05:22] landing and I said I preached the
[1:05:24] message of William moranum
[1:05:27] and I said that's the influence that we
[1:05:30] follow and he said oh okay he kind of
[1:05:33] shoved it off the fellow on the aisle
[1:05:36] seat
[1:05:36] he said I know about brother Branham
[1:05:39] he said I grew up in it my mom was a
[1:05:42] believer
[1:05:43] and he said he began to tell me about
[1:05:45] his life and how it had fell apart how
[1:05:48] things it went a lot of different ways
[1:05:50] in his life
[1:05:52] you know when
[1:05:54] I talked to him about the Lord that God
[1:05:57] could help him
[1:05:58] that God could minister to him
[1:06:01] I told that story over the last 20 years

[1:06:06] different times looking for that man

[1:20:40] Hebrews chapter 13 and verse 1.
[1:20:43] let Brotherly Love continue
[1:20:46] be not forgetful to entertain strangers
[1:20:50] for therebys some have entertained
[1:20:52] angels
[1:20:54] unawares then turn with me to Genesis
[1:20:57] Chapter 18 and we'll read from verse 1.
[1:21:00] and the Lord appeared unto him speaking
[1:21:03] of Abraham
[1:21:04] in the plains of mammary and he sat in
[1:21:07] the tent Door In the Heat of the day
[1:21:10] and he lift up his eyes and looked and
[1:21:13] lo three men stood by him and when he
[1:21:16] saw him saw him he ran to meet them from
[1:21:19] the tent door and bowed himself toward
[1:21:21] the ground and said my Lord if now I
[1:21:25] have found favor in thy sight pass not
[1:21:28] away I pray thee from thy servant let a
[1:21:32] little water I pray you be fetched and
[1:21:34] and wash your feet and rest yourself
[1:21:36] under the tree and I will fetch a morsel
[1:21:39] of bread and and comfort ye your hearts
[1:21:43] after that ye shall pass on for
[1:21:46] therefore are you come to your servant
[1:21:48] and they said so do as thou has said
[1:21:52] and Abraham hastened into the Tenon to
[1:21:55] Sarah and said make ready quickly three
[1:21:59] measures of fine meal needed and and
[1:22:02] make cakes upon the hearts and Abraham
[1:22:05] ran unto the herd and fetched a calf
[1:22:09] tender and good and gave it unto a young
[1:22:12] man and he hastened to dress it and he
[1:22:14] took butter and milk in the calf which
[1:22:16] he had dressed and set before them and
[1:22:20] he stood by them under the tree and they
[1:22:22] did eat and they said unto him where is
[1:22:25] Sarah thy wife and he said behold in the
[1:22:28] tent
[1:22:29] and he said I will certainly return unto
[1:22:32] thee according to the time of life and
[1:22:34] lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son and
[1:22:38] Sarah heard it in the tent door which
[1:22:40] was behind him and Abraham and Sarah
[1:22:44] were old and well-stricken in age and it
[1:22:47] ceased to be with Sarah after the manner
[1:22:50] of the women therefore Sarah laughed
[1:22:53] within herself saying after I am old
[1:22:56] shall I found pleasure my Lord be an old
[1:22:59] also and the Lord said unto Abraham
[1:23:02] wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall
[1:23:06] have assured he bear a child which I'm
[1:23:08] old is anything too hard for the Lord
[1:23:13] at the time appointed I will return unto
[1:23:17] thee according to the time of life and
[1:23:21] Sarah shall have a son
[1:23:23] then Sarah denied saying I laughed not
[1:23:26] for she was afraid and he said nay but
[1:23:30] thou didst life and then one more
[1:23:33] scripture for your seated Luke chapter
[1:23:36] 17 verse 29 we'll read from there but
[1:23:41] the same day that lot went out of Sodom
[1:23:43] it rained fire and brimstone from heaven
[1:23:47] and destroyed them all even thus shall
[1:23:50] it be in the day when the son of man is
[1:23:54] revealed notice this is not when the son
[1:23:58] of man comes but when the son of man is
[1:24:01] revealed amen God bless you can be
[1:24:04] seated
[1:24:05] I'm going to speak tonight on
[1:24:08] um investigating angels
[1:24:12] investigating angels now the Book of
[1:24:16] Genesis is the seed chapter we well know
[1:24:19] and whatever was planted in Genesis it
[1:24:22] comes the Harvest and the end time
[1:24:24] and of course
[1:24:26] um Jesus Jesus told us about that when
[1:24:29] the sower going forth to Sea to sow seed
[1:24:32] but actually not only is the New
[1:24:35] Testament and this the as he said the
[1:24:37] sower is the son of man so the son of
[1:24:40] man has actually been so in seed down
[1:24:43] through the age
[1:24:44] and so looking at that we understand
[1:24:48] that this the the Bible is actually
[1:24:51] prophecy is more than a book of History
[1:24:55] it is prophesying of the end time
[1:24:59] and uh so this is why it would say as it
[1:25:02] was in the days of lot because he's
[1:25:04] telling us that lot was more than just a
[1:25:07] story in the Bible
[1:25:08] but that it was it was um a prophecy of
[1:25:13] the end time so will it be when the son
[1:25:16] of man is revealed and there was uh the
[1:25:20] revealing of the son of man and and
[1:25:22] doing so and in that time the
[1:25:24] investigating Angels brother Branham
[1:25:27] would many time call him investigating
[1:25:29] angels of judgment
[1:25:31] and of course he would hear and the The
[1:25:34] Cry of the sodomites and the sin and
[1:25:38] come down to Sea and of course that was
[1:25:40] investigation he was also investigating
[1:25:44] a lot and there would be
[1:25:46] um uh um where he would find look he's
[1:25:50] investigating he's finding ten righteous
[1:25:53] or less than 10 actually you know the
[1:25:56] righteous pulling them out and then of
[1:25:58] course
[1:25:59] um not only that but he was
[1:26:01] investigating with Abraham and Sarah a
[1:26:04] lot of times we just think him looking
[1:26:06] at
[1:26:07] um the the sodomites and maybe lot a
[1:26:10] little bit but actually he's doing even
[1:26:12] more than that he's investigating
[1:26:15] Abraham and Sarah because somehow Sarah
[1:26:20] has to get on board with the promise
[1:26:22] and she has to start believing
[1:26:26] and the church was represented
[1:26:29] um by lot had to get out of Sodom and
[1:26:33] Abraham was watching because you know he
[1:26:36] was under expectation so here is the
[1:26:39] Church of Abraham and there's part of
[1:26:42] them under expectation and and part of
[1:26:45] them that are just in the Chant without
[1:26:46] any expectation and you know there's all
[1:26:49] kinds of conditions and Abraham is
[1:26:52] watching because he's looking for
[1:26:55] another appearing of the angel of God of
[1:27:00] all the experiences that he'd had before
[1:27:03] then he is now about to receive
[1:27:07] um the greatest crowning uh appearing
[1:27:11] that God would make to him and where he
[1:27:14] was to be crowned with an experience of
[1:27:17] being changed to receive the promised
[1:27:20] son
[1:27:21] so this was the greatest of all
[1:27:23] appearings he had already appeared to
[1:27:25] him and gave him the Divine call that's
[1:27:28] justification and then the blood
[1:27:30] offering which was sanctification he led
[1:27:33] him to that and appeared to him and told
[1:27:35] him how to offer the sacrifice as
[1:27:38] Melchizedek King theophany had revealed
[1:27:42] itself son and served in Bread and Wine
[1:27:45] as that was shut eye The God Who is more
[1:27:48] than enough what we heard about last
[1:27:51] night more than enough
[1:27:53] and the soils of shady eye it types out
[1:27:56] the pouring out of the Holy Ghost but
[1:28:00] now it could send those into God being
[1:28:03] manifested in flesh and human flesh this
[1:28:06] would be the capping off of all the
[1:28:09] visitations of Elohim you see God had
[1:28:13] led him from the earth the Chaldeans
[1:28:16] appearing to him in the land of his
[1:28:18] father and and this would cause Abram
[1:28:21] the idol worshiper to start seeking a
[1:28:24] city whose Builder and maker is God
[1:28:27] and all of this this visitations from
[1:28:31] the age of 75 whether by voice or by
[1:28:35] dream or by visions uh and visitations
[1:28:39] this was now the greatest because God
[1:28:42] would now take on flesh
[1:28:45] and he would come and and would manifest
[1:28:48] himself in a more real more physical way
[1:28:52] for here it was like the fullness of all
[1:28:56] the manifestations of the divine
[1:28:58] presence of God where the word it would
[1:29:02] be like and it was actually pre-figuring
[1:29:04] where the word was made flesh in Jesus
[1:29:07] Christ
[1:29:08] and let me say that the appearance of
[1:29:11] God in this last day is again a
[1:29:14] culmination
[1:29:15] of all the appearance it is the highest
[1:29:20] point of the visitations of God since
[1:29:23] the day of Pentecost and it's not a mere
[1:29:26] baptism of the Holy Ghost but rather is
[1:29:29] accepting off of them pouring out of the
[1:29:33] entire deity of God into his bride body
[1:29:38] and so in disappearing to Abraham there
[1:29:41] were three Ethiopians that stepped into
[1:29:43] uh there are three theophanes that
[1:29:47] stepped into bodies that gathered from
[1:29:49] the elements of the earth bodies that
[1:29:51] were gathered from the elements of the
[1:29:53] earth and came and appeared unto Abraham
[1:29:57] now God was showing in types and shadows
[1:30:00] here that in the last days
[1:30:02] theophonies are about to enter into view
[1:30:06] and and when we see them we're going to
[1:30:09] be chains and receive Christ The
[1:30:12] Promised Son of God
[1:30:14] so you see it's actually prophesying
[1:30:17] that theophonies are about to come into
[1:30:20] view
[1:30:21] you are a people that are about to see
[1:30:25] what other ages only long to see
[1:30:28] and that is that we are to receive not
[1:30:31] only the promised son but the openings
[1:30:33] come from that other realm and when we
[1:30:36] see them we'll be changed to be like
[1:30:38] them
[1:30:39] and in order to do that there are going
[1:30:42] to be people that has to be expecting
[1:30:44] his appearing that love is appearing for
[1:30:49] as he said in second Timothy 4 and 8
[1:30:51] that henceforth there is laid up for me
[1:30:54] a crown of righteousness which the Lord
[1:30:57] the righteous judge shall give me of
[1:30:58] that day and not to me only but to also
[1:31:02] all those that love his appearing
[1:31:04] there's going to be people loving his
[1:31:07] appearing now is is appearing brother
[1:31:11] random explained to us was it was
[1:31:14] different from his coming they're two
[1:31:15] different things but you see but this is
[1:31:18] not the the appearance is not his
[1:31:21] Corporal return but it's where that he
[1:31:23] comes down and manifests himself in a
[1:31:27] spiritual manner there as he reveals
[1:31:29] himself and takes on mask in this end
[1:31:33] time I'm talking about flesh amen then
[1:31:36] he'll wrap himself behind dust now this
[1:31:40] is the end time where angels are
[1:31:42] appearing and and they as they appear
[1:31:46] Among Us they are investigating they're
[1:31:49] looking for the evidence of holiness
[1:31:52] they're looking for the evidence of the
[1:31:54] Holy Ghost being in your life they are
[1:31:57] examining and looking for the evidence
[1:32:00] of faith they are looking for those that
[1:32:04] are ready to marry the bridegroom who
[1:32:07] love the Lord with all their heart with
[1:32:10] all their might with all their soul
[1:32:13] so you know again brother Brandon would
[1:32:16] tell us and and many different sermons
[1:32:18] about Abraham this is one of his his
[1:32:21] main theme as he picks up this prophecy
[1:32:23] that is laying in the seed chapter and
[1:32:26] he says remember Jesus Christ the son of
[1:32:29] God said the same thing would repeat
[1:32:31] again as it was in the days of Sodom so
[1:32:35] shall it be in the coming of the son of
[1:32:37] man that God would be working through
[1:32:39] human flesh doing the same thing that he
[1:32:43] did then oh God help us to wake up the
[1:32:46] day of visitation is here
[1:32:49] you say oh well God doesn't send Angels
[1:32:52] anymore the holy spirit is that angel
[1:32:55] the holy spirit is that person amen the
[1:32:59] Holy Spirit Jesus said he the Holy Ghost
[1:33:02] when he comes he will do the works that
[1:33:04] he did he will be with us even in us and
[1:33:07] he would bring all things to our
[1:33:09] remembrance that he had been taught and
[1:33:11] would show us things to come the works
[1:33:14] that I do shall he do also now we're
[1:33:17] living in that day we're living in that
[1:33:20] time I'm telling you tonight we are
[1:33:22] living in the most awesome hour and I'm
[1:33:26] aware that God is revealing himself in
[1:33:30] this day in a very spectacular way
[1:33:34] now when when the Holy Ghost
[1:33:37] dispensation came in brother Brandon
[1:33:39] said it come in and continues on and
[1:33:41] will continue on by the administration
[1:33:44] of angels to the to the church
[1:33:47] truly but there ordained spirits of God
[1:33:50] sent to carry things out and he said
[1:33:53] it'll speak and testify of Jesus Christ
[1:33:56] and it'll produce Jesus Christ to this
[1:33:59] people now under this Administration
[1:34:02] they will visit homes that will visit
[1:34:05] churches
[1:34:07] how many times have brother Benham say
[1:34:09] that Angels were walking up and down
[1:34:12] stopping by every pew
[1:34:16] and they're investigating
[1:34:18] they're looking for somebody that will
[1:34:20] believe
[1:34:21] somebody that is ready to receive him
[1:34:24] somebody with me amen and they visit
[1:34:27] home and they stir the people and then
[1:34:29] brother Madam said it this way May the
[1:34:31] angels of God come down into this city
[1:34:34] the city's roundabout and throughout the
[1:34:37] country and visit homes and stir the
[1:34:40] people
[1:34:42] amen oh my did you know brother random
[1:34:45] said that when when you feel that that
[1:34:48] certain feeling coming by you he said
[1:34:51] you're actually bumping into angels
[1:34:55] amen that they're here in every service
[1:34:59] now here in this service tonight
[1:35:01] and they are investigating they're
[1:35:05] looking there at your life
[1:35:07] looking looking expected remember even
[1:35:10] Jesus said when the son of man cometh
[1:35:12] will I find
[1:35:14] faith I'm gonna be looking for faith
[1:35:17] there's going to be an investigating
[1:35:19] that is going on and I am looking for
[1:35:22] somebody who will believe me
[1:35:28] now God has always used angels in his
[1:35:30] word all the way down from the earliest
[1:35:33] Parts in Genesis they've had angels in
[1:35:36] every dispensation
[1:35:38] and you know theologians will say to
[1:35:40] brother Branham they criticized him
[1:35:42] because he was the only one of them of
[1:35:45] all of the Divine healers that went
[1:35:47] forth that was visited by an Angel
[1:35:50] commissioned by an Angel
[1:35:52] I often say to people you got problems
[1:35:55] with this message you got problems with
[1:35:56] the angels
[1:35:58] this one not brother Brandon's message

[1:36:04] the very angel that has earned the
[1:36:06] hearts amen the very angels that knew

[1:36:22] problems not with William Branham you
[1:36:24] have got problem with the angel

[1:36:34] even when it would come down to the
[1:36:36] seals he said I was about to make a
[1:36:39] horrible mistake I was going over to
[1:36:41] some of my old notes and things and
[1:36:43] thought I would preach on that and what
[1:36:45] this one said and that one said and
[1:36:47] about that time the angel of God came
[1:36:50] into the room and straightened out my
[1:36:52] thinking

[1:36:56] delivered by the angel
[1:36:58] [Applause]
[1:36:59] [Music]

[1:37:03] Branham said you keep talking about that
[1:37:05] angel that's a narrow son God don't lead
[1:37:08] the Church By Angels anymore that's the
[1:37:10] holy spirit that leads the church in the
[1:37:11] last day he said that's true but they're
[1:37:13] still angels

[1:37:21] Testament Doctrine brother Brandon he
[1:37:23] said oh oh sure it is so you believe the
[1:37:25] Virgin Mary was in the New Testament
[1:37:27] when the angel Gabriel goes up there so
[1:37:29] yeah but that was for the Holy Ghost

[1:39:00] and he said listen stay with the ship
[1:39:04] everyone that stays with the ship is
[1:39:06] going to be safe
[1:39:09] that's what the Angels saying tonight
[1:39:11] don't leave the ship
[1:39:13] don't leave the message
[1:39:16] and but don't leave it
[1:39:18] because everyone that stays with the

[1:39:29] tolerate sustained by yourself stay with
[1:39:32] the angel and his message

[1:39:43] angels of God are ministering Spirits
[1:39:46] sent from the presence of God
[1:39:49] ministering spirits
[1:39:51] sent from his presence
[1:39:53] and it's not just men

[1:40:02] by the way in the last day he don't just
[1:40:04] pour out his Spirit on men
[1:40:07] but on my sons and daughters
[1:40:11] amen
[1:40:12] God sent an angel to to Hagar to the
[1:40:16] mother of Samson to marry the mother of
[1:40:18] Jesus to women at the Tomb of Jesus
[1:40:21] announcing the resurrection
[1:40:25] and Angels Came not just to great people

[1:44:39] the wilderness
[1:44:40] and the other at Gethsemane
[1:44:43] amen Angels were are given charge over
[1:44:46] us
[1:44:47] and even even Jesus with just a command
[1:44:50] just a word of command he could have
[1:44:53] called 12 Legions of angels
[1:44:56] who were standing by ready to defend him
[1:45:01] amen that's exactly what you were you
[1:45:05] stand here tonight
[1:45:07] amen because it's not only for Jesus but
[1:45:10] it's for us

[1:45:16] is that right amen unless we Dash our
[1:45:20] foot against the stone oh the devil
[1:45:21] tried to use that but that's still our
[1:45:23] scripture
[1:45:24] amen but it's but it's not only for
[1:45:27] Jesus it's for us and in the last day he
[1:45:30] stands up for his people in that day

[1:45:36] stand up

[1:45:40] children of thy people and there'll be a
[1:45:43] time of trouble as such as never was
[1:45:45] since there was a nation even to that
[1:45:47] same time and at that time that people
[1:45:50] shall be delivered everyone that shall
[1:45:53] be found written in the book

[1:46:01] to defend this people amen and he will
[1:46:04] deliver everyone whose names are found

[1:46:37] pray open this boy's eyes remember that
[1:46:40] amen and brother Bradham told us when
[1:46:42] that happened there he said God didn't
[1:46:44] send Angels there they were already
[1:46:46] there
[1:46:47] he just opened the eyes where they could
[1:46:50] see them
[1:46:51] amen you're never alone
[1:46:58] never alone
[1:47:00] you see angels have a lot to do with
[1:47:03] guidance to our prepared places he said
[1:47:05] behold I send an angel before you to
[1:47:08] keep you in the way and to bring you to
[1:47:11] the place that I have prepared
[1:47:14] Angels anoint men to preach and I saw
[1:47:18] another angel fly in the midst of heaven
[1:47:20] heaven the Everlasting gospel to preach
[1:47:22] unto them that dwell on the Earth Angels
[1:47:25] anoint men
[1:47:27] amen that is coming he will send angels
[1:47:30] with the Great Sound of the trumpet and
[1:47:33] gather you the elect from the different
[1:47:35] directions or four directions
[1:47:37] let's not forget
[1:47:39] the mighty angel of Revelation 10.
[1:47:44] Hallelujah amen it is the same angel of
[1:47:49] God that met Moses in the first Exodus
[1:47:53] and he's here in the Third Exodus
[1:47:57] to take a people out of here come on
[1:48:00] somebody amen an anointing come down

[1:48:24] you he's not gonna leave one of you
[1:48:27] alone
[1:48:27] [Applause]
[1:48:38] brother Branham said it's the theme of
[1:48:40] my meetings Jesus Christ the same
[1:48:42] yesterday today and forever because it
[1:48:45] was Jesus Christ that Moses esteemed the
[1:48:48] reproach of Christ greater than the
[1:48:50] treasures of Egypt that was Christ
[1:48:53] amen the logos
[1:48:56] not Jesus
[1:48:58] amen the physical body hadn't been born
[1:49:00] yet but that but Christ was always there
[1:49:04] somebody helped me preach it was Jesus
[1:49:06] Christ he was in a pillar of fire that
[1:49:09] same was the same angel that was in that
[1:49:12] bush and burning the same pillar of
[1:49:13] power and he has been guiding Angel The
[1:49:17] Guiding Angel through the years oh I'm
[1:49:20] glad for that
[1:49:21] and he wants to visit your home
[1:49:25] he wants to come by your way he wants to
[1:49:28] visit you in your seat
[1:49:30] he wants to walk down your aisle he
[1:49:33] wants to be in this church
[1:49:36] and he's investigating looking for
[1:49:38] somebody that'll believe him
[1:49:45] amen I remember when he visited our
[1:49:48] house
[1:49:49] I remember that day when my wife was
[1:49:52] blind and couldn't see after having a
[1:49:54] brain bleed that's been about eight
[1:49:56] years ago and they're feeling sorry for
[1:49:58] herself unable to go to the bathroom by
[1:50:00] herself and all of that kind of thing
[1:50:02] and was wondering about her life and so
[1:50:05] on and and as he was blind in her in her
[1:50:08] peripheral vision the doctor said well
[1:50:10] we make some glasses maybe you might get
[1:50:12] some back or whatever but it's really
[1:50:15] kind of hopeless and and my my daughter
[1:50:18] had a little 18 month old baby that
[1:50:21] brother Ron had seen the vision of
[1:50:22] walking
[1:50:23] and and there he had an underdeveloped
[1:50:27] hip was able to stand or walk or crawl
[1:50:31] or couldn't stand alone by himself he
[1:50:34] would hold on and just totter like that
[1:50:36] you know he couldn't take a step and see
[1:50:38] him Bethany him in that day and set the
[1:50:41] baby down at the end of the bed and the
[1:50:44] moment my wife began to turn from
[1:50:46] feeling sorry for herself and began to
[1:50:48] have a praise come out of her heart
[1:50:51] and began to worship God the angel of
[1:50:54] God comes sweeping over her her sight
[1:50:57] came back came on down to the end of the
[1:51:00] bed and a baby who had never been able
[1:51:02] to crawl or walk jumped up and ran all
[1:51:04] over my house
[1:51:12] the angel will visit you tonight
[1:51:15] but he's looking for somebody that I
[1:51:18] believe him
[1:51:20] he's investigating
[1:51:26] Hallelujah
[1:51:32] Glory
[1:51:38] the Bible said when when Abraham saw the
[1:51:42] Angels appearing he ran from the temp
[1:51:45] door
[1:51:46] and bowed himself to the ground he ran
[1:51:49] he had a passion he must not pass me by
[1:51:53] I must get a hold of him tonight I've
[1:51:56] got to have him
[1:51:59] and he bowed before him and then before
[1:52:02] the ground the sound sign of submission
[1:52:05] and reverence of humility and
[1:52:07] recognizing greatness
[1:52:11] 1946
[1:52:13] the angel of God appeared to brother
[1:52:15] Branham
[1:52:16] sent him out with a gift of Divine
[1:52:18] Healing
[1:52:22] you know a lot of the critics
[1:52:24] want to say well William Branham he just
[1:52:26] tried to make himself Elijah
[1:52:29] let me tell you something
[1:52:30] God said it on the Ohio River
[1:52:33] but if you just read a little history
[1:52:36] Gordon Lindsay tells it in a man sent
[1:52:38] from God two different occasions
[1:52:42] the Pentecostals jumped up in brother
[1:52:45] Brandon's meetings never had been in a
[1:52:47] meeting before and jumped up and
[1:52:49] prophesied and that in one Speaking
[1:52:51] tongues and another another interpreter
[1:52:53] said ask John the Baptist
[1:52:57] as John the Baptist was sent them for
[1:52:59] around the first coming of Christ you're
[1:53:01] certainly the message to four could run
[1:53:03] the second coming of Christ
[1:53:06] how has John the Baptist how did John
[1:53:09] come
[1:53:10] in the spirit and the power of Elijah
[1:53:14] so you see it wasn't brother Brandon
[1:53:16] saying I'm Elijah even God said to their
[1:53:19] own lips
[1:53:21] that this is Elijah and he said to turn
[1:53:25] the hearts of the children back to the
[1:53:27] faith of the fathers
[1:53:34] in those meetings he found resistance to
[1:53:37] the Angel's message of Divine Healing
[1:53:40] and the old formal established churches
[1:53:43] it got to a place they didn't believe in
[1:53:45] miracles
[1:53:47] even among the Pentecostals the Assembly
[1:53:51] of God one of them there I think it was
[1:53:53] in Little Rock all right brother Brown
[1:53:54] tells about it that he that he treated
[1:53:56] him so the worst I've ever been treated
[1:53:58] anywhere was by an Assembly of God
[1:54:01] preacher
[1:54:02] and he said I went to the pastor and
[1:54:04] asked him to borrow some pews because we
[1:54:06] needed we needed more seats for the 10th
[1:54:09] and and we we did was running out of a
[1:54:11] seating room and he said huh I'm not
[1:54:14] looting my my seats or my my are
[1:54:18] nothing to this this radical stuff for
[1:54:21] this Angel come into a prophet I'm not
[1:54:24] doing that I'm not supporting that you
[1:54:27] see he only even received
[1:54:29] um resistance even among the
[1:54:31] Pentecostals themselves
[1:54:34] you know and because you know many of
[1:54:37] them these old formal established
[1:54:39] churches had got to a place where they
[1:54:42] no longer believed in miracles
[1:54:44] they were just not happening in their
[1:54:47] churches and so to excuse themselves of
[1:54:51] being void of the power of God they felt
[1:54:54] with their Superior knowledge of the
[1:54:57] word they were just too advanced for the
[1:54:59] Supernatural and they thought the
[1:55:02] supernatural was only for an infant
[1:55:04] Church
[1:55:05] and that if you were really established
[1:55:08] in the word you know you were just too
[1:55:10] dignified to believe in childish things
[1:55:16] that was a thinking
[1:55:18] during his rest between revivals brother
[1:55:20] Bradham went up to British Columbia and
[1:55:22] tired and weary after hours upon hours
[1:55:24] of prayer lines he spent days away from
[1:55:26] the pressures of those meetings and
[1:55:29] refreshing himself miles from the
[1:55:31] civilization up there in British
[1:55:33] Columbia he got up there and began to
[1:55:35] chase a grizzly bear he said I just want
[1:55:38] to see him
[1:55:40] so he said I was on my horse and I was I
[1:55:43] was chasing this grizzly bear on a horse
[1:55:46] and wanted to see the old fell on I got
[1:55:48] turned around up in the mountains and I
[1:55:50] got kind of Cloudy and the snowstorm was
[1:55:52] coming and and he said I couldn't see uh
[1:55:55] I couldn't I couldn't I could I found my
[1:55:58] directions which way to go back because
[1:56:00] you know there was um nothing for
[1:56:02] hundreds of miles no roads or anything
[1:56:04] and and said I was on my way back and I
[1:56:07] was riding about nine o'clock and I come
[1:56:09] to an old burn over
[1:56:11] he said how many knows what the burn
[1:56:14] over is it's uh where the fire is
[1:56:16] burning all the wood down and everything
[1:56:17] like that just a big old tree stands and
[1:56:20] all split and the sap all born off of
[1:56:23] them the bark and you stand there
[1:56:24] looking at big old stately trees and and
[1:56:27] I looked there and first thing you know
[1:56:29] it was the it was the most spookiest
[1:56:31] place I'd ever come to
[1:56:34] I saw the moon shining on them big old
[1:56:37] white trees and you know the bark off of
[1:56:40] them and they're dead and I said it
[1:56:42] looked like a gravestone a graveyard
[1:56:44] with a lot of tombstones and and the
[1:56:48] spirit of God spoke to him says just
[1:56:49] stop here for a minute and observe and
[1:56:51] well he's uh you know within this up I'm
[1:56:54] hurry I'm starved I need to get back and
[1:56:56] and uh but he just stopped for a little
[1:56:58] bit and watched and he began to hear the
[1:57:03] wind come down from heaven and pass
[1:57:04] through them and the trees went
[1:57:06] [Music]
[1:57:10] I don't talk about a lonesome spooky
[1:57:13] place
[1:57:13] Lord why do you want me to stop right
[1:57:15] here and the wind would come again
[1:57:17] [Music]
[1:57:20] and he said he began to think of the
[1:57:22] scripture in the Book of Joel what the
[1:57:25] Palm warm left
[1:57:26] the canker worm eating what the
[1:57:28] caterpillar the canker worm mating and
[1:57:31] he thought he said yeah that was once a
[1:57:33] great forest and there were great green
[1:57:35] trees and that were just like a bunch of
[1:57:38] churches great big spiers to us like
[1:57:41] that with would look like tombstones and
[1:57:44] he said to the spiritual thermometer a
[1:57:47] thousand degrees below zero
[1:57:50] walk in there and somebody said amen and
[1:57:53] they turn around and the pastor get a
[1:57:54] deacon and take him outside the door
[1:57:56] what are you interrupting me when you're
[1:57:59] hollering you're interrupting me when
[1:58:01] you're hollering me man well you said
[1:58:02] you interrupt me when you don't holler
[1:58:04] amen
[1:58:09] and he said I looked at them tombstones
[1:58:11] just a deadly Tombstone and then said
[1:58:14] there was no spirit in it whatsoever
[1:58:17] and I thought they're just a bunch of
[1:58:19] tombstones he said no doubt once we're
[1:58:22] big churches find trees of methodists
[1:58:25] and Baptists and you know Pentecostal
[1:58:28] whatever and they were but but now
[1:58:30] they're they're been burn over
[1:58:33] and scorched by a fire and and he said I
[1:58:37] I happen to think you know they were big
[1:58:40] churches one time but now God can send
[1:58:43] an old-time Pentecostal Revival and all
[1:58:46] the churches do is just mourn when he
[1:58:48] hits them
[1:58:50] they're stiff and they're dead and they
[1:58:52] can't move they just go hmm there's no
[1:58:54] such thing as Divine Healing Divine
[1:58:57] Healing is gone days of Miracles are
[1:58:59] passed no such thing as gifts of the
[1:59:02] Spirit just the poor poor and the holy
[1:59:04] ghost moving right through the members
[1:59:06] of oh we don't believe in that well
[1:59:09] that's fanaticism weird churches we
[1:59:12] ain't got ritual we're recorded but he
[1:59:15] said brother you're dead
[1:59:17] just a bunch of ritualistic Tombstone
[1:59:20] the only thing you can do is moan and
[1:59:23] cry but God sent a Revival just the same
[1:59:27] and he said I thought you know what the
[1:59:30] Pummel were made the caterpillar ate the
[1:59:32] Lucas eaten and what the Baptists left
[1:59:34] the Nazarene eat and what the Nazarene
[1:59:36] left the Pentecostal eating the old
[1:59:37] things eaten down
[1:59:40] and he said he goes on and talks about
[1:59:43] it he said I said oh God what do we do
[1:59:47] and then he said I got to thinking about
[1:59:49] the furthers of the Book of Job
[1:59:52] that said over in the second chapter of
[1:59:55] job said I will restore saith the Lord
[1:59:59] I thought and he said how God are you
[2:00:02] going to restore that
[2:00:04] bunch of tombstones dead you know here
[2:00:07] he's been in meetings and trying to
[2:00:09] preach an angel came Divine Healing and
[2:00:13] God's appearing Among Us and he's
[2:00:15] bringing Deliverance he's showing signs
[2:00:18] of his power and doing all of that and
[2:00:21] yet they're they're they're rejecting it
[2:00:23] and he said how in the world are we
[2:00:25] going to have a restoration there
[2:00:27] and he said I look there at the old dead
[2:00:30] thing in the old stump with the moon
[2:00:32] signing on it moaning and groaning and
[2:00:34] it can't give no life in it and the wind
[2:00:37] goes it comes and goes
[2:00:40] you can't I said you can't make that
[2:00:42] thing move Lord they hadn't got any
[2:00:44] substance it hadn't got no life about it
[2:00:47] it's all dried up and gone how can you
[2:00:50] have Revival in these old cold formal
[2:00:52] churches
[2:00:54] first place it won't let you in the
[2:00:56] Pulpit to preach this kind of a gospel
[2:00:59] oh the guy he's a Holy Roller don't want
[2:01:01] nothing to do with him
[2:01:03] the members bring you in all right but
[2:01:06] I'll have to consult to the board and
[2:01:08] the deacons and all them and this and we
[2:01:10] go through that no no no right down the
[2:01:12] road don't tell me he said I've been
[2:01:13] there
[2:01:15] amen and said no none of that in our
[2:01:17] church he just tear our church to pieces
[2:01:19] and so he he said as he looked there and
[2:01:24] he was watching and said Lord what are
[2:01:26] you wanting me to see I I can't see how
[2:01:29] you're going to restore these old dead
[2:01:31] churches but he said directly I heard
[2:01:34] something going Frolic Frolic Frolic
[2:01:37] Frolic and I thought what is that and he
[2:01:40] said there was some undergrowth coming
[2:01:42] up it's a little bitty trees
[2:01:46] so there you are Lord I will restore and
[2:01:48] saith the Lord right in that same Forest
[2:01:51] come up and undergrowth that they call
[2:01:54] backwash today that they called for
[2:01:56] Madison today but look at the difference
[2:01:58] when the wind hits these Amen to do you
[2:02:01] say
[2:02:02] but when they hit some little green
[2:02:04] trees that's got life in it it just
[2:02:07] frolics and jumps up and down and
[2:02:09] old-fashioned Holy Ghost Revival
[2:02:13] Hallelujah
[2:02:18] Hallelujah
[2:02:20] thank you Jesus
[2:02:25] amen
[2:02:27] for he said I will restore saith the
[2:02:31] Lord
[2:02:32] amen he said God wants to restore the
[2:02:34] faith that was once delivered to the
[2:02:37] Saints
[2:02:39] he investigated this age and said you
[2:02:42] got to have more faith your hearts have
[2:02:45] got to be turned back to Faith again so
[2:02:47] he sends an angel
[2:02:51] love you
[2:02:53] to turn your heart
[2:02:56] amen like he did up in the upper room
[2:02:59] when the angel of God appeared there
[2:03:01] that time
[2:03:03] they got life and went to the windows
[2:03:05] and doors and out on the street and they
[2:03:07] acted like a bunch of maniacs and
[2:03:09] screamed and and staggered and hollered
[2:03:11] and everything else like a bunch of
[2:03:13] drunk people
[2:03:15] amen and they said that these men are
[2:03:17] full of new wine and brother Brandon
[2:03:20] said the the Blessed Virgin Mary to you
[2:03:22] Catholic people
[2:03:24] so it was in there
[2:03:26] and he said if God Almighty required the
[2:03:29] Blessed Virgin Mary and wouldn't let her
[2:03:31] come to Heaven until she got that
[2:03:32] experience how are you going to get in
[2:03:34] with anything short of that
[2:03:42] the peering of angels is investigating
[2:03:46] angels of judgment Jesus is looking for
[2:03:50] faith
[2:03:51] the angels are looking for those who
[2:03:53] sigh and cry
[2:03:55] for the Abominations that are done in
[2:03:58] the city
[2:03:59] amen amen Mystic lights are in the sky
[2:04:04] brother random said they don't know what
[2:04:06] they are he had his own insight to them
[2:04:09] he said you know what I'm thinking Jesus
[2:04:11] said before the where it comes before he
[2:04:14] comes there will be signs in the heavens
[2:04:15] above did you notice before he destroyed
[2:04:18] Sodom and gomar because of the sex
[2:04:20] Affairs he sent Angels down to
[2:04:23] investigated angels has come to the

[2:06:30] supernatural away from the Bible you
[2:06:32] take God out of the church by your
[2:06:34] traditions

[2:06:40] believing
[2:06:42] you're going to have to believe in
[2:06:44] angels before they can help you God
[2:06:46] can't work against your unbelief

[2:09:27] without which no man shall see the Lord
[2:09:30] you know that we have seen now sin and
[2:09:34] unholiness creep in
[2:09:36] women with skirts so tight
[2:09:43] [Applause]
[2:09:53] all right
[2:09:55] you wear these I'm quoting the prophet
[2:09:57] you wear these little tight skirts
[2:09:59] they're so tight going down the street
[2:10:01] so tight to the skins on the outside and
[2:10:04] call yourself Holiness women is that the
[2:10:07] way a daughter of God would act
[2:10:11] clothes way above the knees topped off
[2:10:13] with painted nails
[2:10:17] [Music]
[2:10:22] wearing your makeup
[2:10:24] and preachers saying uh you know you're
[2:10:27] you're wearing just a little bit too
[2:10:30] much makeup I can I I you know I is
[2:10:33] beginning you know to show
[2:10:39] a little bit too much
[2:10:44] look at the Modern one today a little
[2:10:45] skin down dress that ever formed she
[2:10:48] can't move without sinning this is the
[2:10:51] message
[2:10:51] walking tipping down the street with
[2:10:54] makeup and cosmetic and cosmetics a Max
[2:10:57] Factor can put on her nearly and fixing
[2:11:00] her hair like some little girl and wear
[2:11:02] a little skirt just up above her knees
[2:11:03] and she got on any at all but you look
[2:11:05] at her she's pretty Satan knows how to
[2:11:07] do it he's the author of beauty that
[2:11:10] type of beauty which results in sin
[2:11:15] [Applause]
[2:11:17] I might be going out on the limb right
[2:11:19] here and if it is your pastor can cut it
[2:11:22] off but anyway you know I I see a new
[2:11:25] style rising up out of hell
[2:11:30] of these leggings
[2:11:32] these worldly women that wear them and
[2:11:35] show every form of their body
[2:11:39] and you know those that try to be a
[2:11:41] little more modest they wear a t-shirt
[2:11:43] you know about down here you know just
[2:11:45] see you know and and and uh just enough
[2:11:49] to cover their bottom
[2:11:51] but now it's coming in with our girls
[2:11:55] with the skirt that barely covers a knee
[2:11:57] if at all
[2:11:59] and then they sit and expose himself to
[2:12:02] their thigh or their crotch and think
[2:12:04] they're covered
[2:12:06] no they're not covered
[2:12:10] and for people that are expecting or
[2:12:12] appearing how can we when Angels don't
[2:12:16] visit places where Holiness and modesty
[2:12:19] and righteousness don't abound
[2:12:21] [Applause]
[2:12:24] I thought it was wonderful you know
[2:12:27] brother Brandon as we as so many came
[2:12:30] out of the Holiness move and you
[2:12:33] couldn't wear a wedding ring and brother
[2:12:34] Brandon said you should and you know he
[2:12:36] didn't actually can can we can wear wear
[2:12:40] a little necklaces sisters and and said
[2:12:42] yes you know you can wear a little
[2:12:44] necklace but he said don't look like
[2:12:47] that you walked into a dime store
[2:12:50] a 10 cent store with a magnet on
[2:12:55] [Applause]
[2:13:04] I I get the wedding ring and I get the
[2:13:08] necklace that the prophet of God told
[2:13:10] you could wear but where where this
[2:13:12] magnet you got on got and you got one on
[2:13:14] your toe now and
[2:13:16] one on
[2:13:20] an ankle bracelet
[2:13:27] all kinds of other things you know every
[2:13:30] jangle and bangle and everything else

[2:13:36] one of these modern preachers you got
[2:13:37] that right
[2:13:45] I still believe in holiness
[2:13:49] are you with me
[2:13:53] how are you gonna run to meet him and
[2:13:56] you got the world written all over your
[2:13:58] life
[2:14:01] and the same thing with your boys
[2:14:02] picking up every kind of bad that there
[2:14:05] is amen Abraham ran to me him
[2:14:09] amen look into passion look at the
[2:14:13] passion when he saw the angel he must be
[2:14:15] he must be he must be persuaded to stop
[2:14:20] [Applause]
[2:14:22] passes by
[2:14:28] brother Branham said the young men will
[2:14:30] sign up for the military and fight their
[2:14:33] battles and they can be great men of
[2:14:35] courage and give them their lives for
[2:14:37] the country and then stick their head up
[2:14:39] and let somebody shoot it all but he
[2:14:41] said seldom will you find one that'll
[2:14:43] lay down his life for the cause of
[2:14:45] Christ
[2:14:46] he won't even crawl out of his shade
[2:14:48] tree to go to church
[2:14:51] won't even get out from behind the
[2:14:53] television long enough to attend a
[2:14:55] Wednesday night prayer meeting
[2:14:58] that's a disgrace it's a shame that's
[2:15:01] the reason Angels don't visit the
[2:15:02] churches that's the reason Angels don't
[2:15:05] visit homes we got to get down to deep
[2:15:08] sincerity of this thing the angels of
[2:15:10] God are here on Earth tonight just the
[2:15:13] same as they've always been

[2:15:36] little water I pray you be fetched and

[2:15:52] elements and you stepped into it

[2:16:15] he's looking for somebody that will
[2:16:18] entertain him
[2:16:19] angels will gather the elect from the
[2:16:22] four directions of the earth to do this
[2:16:24] angels will have to investigate
[2:16:27] they're looking for sincere and honest
[2:16:30] hearts they're looking for those that
[2:16:31] are zealous to repent
[2:16:34] the angels are Reapers and and they're
[2:16:37] separating and Gathering and to do that
[2:16:40] they have to look and investigate
[2:16:43] amen so I wanted to say this just who is
[2:16:46] this that's appearing Among Us
[2:16:48] brother Brandon would tell us who it is

[2:17:01] word the same Jesus
[2:17:05] Hallelujah the same God that manifests
[2:17:08] himself in a human body and disappeared
[2:17:10] a moment that same God would manifest
[2:17:12] himself in a people human flesh in the
[2:17:15] form of the Holy Ghost of believing
[2:17:17] people in the last days at the evening
[2:17:19] light
[2:17:21] it's the son of man revealing himself in
[2:17:25] the bright body it's his appearing but
[2:17:29] he is not using dust that he gathered up
[2:17:32] and had 16 elements and stepped into
[2:17:35] neither is he doing it the one the way
[2:17:38] he did it with Mary
[2:17:40] come on listen he had to do it that way
[2:17:43] at that time because there was nobody
[2:17:46] redeemed the blood had not been shed
[2:17:49] come on somebody so what did he do he
[2:17:53] had to gather dust
[2:17:56] that's what he had to do but now through
[2:17:59] the blood and the baptism of the Holy
[2:18:02] Ghost he is coming to dwell in your dust

[2:18:37] visitations from Luther back to Wesley
[2:18:40] then the Pentecostals the Tums and the
[2:18:43] lips and now it's in the prophetic eyes
[2:18:45] of Malachi 4 and now there is nothing
[2:18:49] else left for it to come but for him
[2:18:54] himself to step into that
[2:18:58] Hallelujah that's what he's looking for
[2:19:00] tonight he's looking for vessels he's
[2:19:03] looking for people he can step into

[2:19:39] that Jesus Christ is revealed in the
[2:19:42] form of son of man in human flesh
[2:19:45] through the bride's body
[2:19:47] except his call

[2:21:22] that is willing to water my camels
[2:21:26] let him let that one be the bride for
[2:21:30] Isaac
[2:21:31] and brother Brandon said the angel of
[2:21:33] God got to Rebecca 30 minutes before

[2:21:39] and said get down there to the well
[2:21:42] [Applause]

[2:23:04] the bride's Revival is happening because
[2:23:07] God is gathering the bride
[2:23:10] a people for his namesake
[2:23:18] Rebecca would have to carry about five
[2:23:20] gallons of water at a time to water 10
[2:23:23] camels would be 300 gallons
[2:23:26] 60 trips down to the well
[2:23:28] I remember with every step of it down

[2:26:23] said let me wash your feet
[2:26:26] let me wash the dirt off of you
[2:26:29] you know
[2:26:30] and the sermon is there anything to the
[2:26:33] heart for the Lord
[2:26:35] brother Branham describes Sarah as in a
[2:26:37] bad mood
[2:26:40] now she represents the church so does
[2:26:42] Abraham together they make a church
[2:26:46] in the sermon there he describes her
[2:26:48] being in a bad mood you know
[2:26:50] here it was Angels were passing by and
[2:26:53] he said Sarah Sarah can I get out of the
[2:26:55] temp
[2:26:56] get over there need some bread maybe
[2:26:59] make some unleavened bread
[2:27:01] oh it's too hot
[2:27:04] it's too hot to be making unleavened
[2:27:07] bread Abraham
[2:27:09] you got these visitors and you want to
[2:27:11] make what
[2:27:13] In the Heat of the day don't you know
[2:27:15] how hot Sodom is
[2:27:18] don't you know how much trouble there is
[2:27:20] in the eggs
[2:27:22] well I'm just not in the mood to cook
[2:27:25] today
[2:27:26] oh man maybe some of you Brothers can
[2:27:29] thank me after this
[2:27:30] [Applause]
[2:27:32] foreign
[2:27:34] but I want to say it's just too hot
[2:27:37] they're saying it's too hot to make
[2:27:39] unleavened bread for the appearance I
[2:27:41] want to say this too hot not to make
[2:27:44] unleavened bread
[2:27:50] because it can't be an 11 and the bread
[2:27:52] that is offered to Angels it must be the
[2:27:55] unleavened bread or the sincerity and
[2:27:58] Truth
[2:28:00] but Sarah was in a bad mood
[2:28:03] Sarah was about to miss it
[2:28:07] but then he called her name
[2:28:13] because he's determined you're not going
[2:28:15] to miss it
[2:28:19] where is Sarah thy life
[2:28:22] you see God Has Come investigating
[2:28:26] looking for a Sarah
[2:28:31] come on somebody he will call you your
[2:28:34] name
[2:28:35] where is Sarah thy wife ah she's in the
[2:28:39] tent
[2:28:40] you ain't God's passing by and she's in
[2:28:42] the tent yeah
[2:28:45] you mean we're over here and she's in
[2:28:47] there pouting
[2:28:50] season different
[2:28:52] she got a bad attitude
[2:28:57] until you hear the promise instead of
[2:28:59] believing it in this mood she will doubt
[2:29:01] it
[2:29:03] well I don't believe in angels in this
[2:29:05] battle I'll tell you I that said some
[2:29:07] bunch of hoopla oh you know that it's
[2:29:09] just a bunch of worked up people you
[2:29:10] know that's that that Holy Ghost and
[2:29:12] talk about is this emotion
[2:29:15] in this mood she will doubt it
[2:29:18] it's too hard to believe why Abraham and
[2:29:20] I have been dead in our bodies for years
[2:29:24] now
[2:29:25] it's too impossible my my breasts would
[2:29:28] never give milk I I don't have streaks
[2:29:31] to bring forth the power is gone well we
[2:29:36] haven't had a Revival in years and years
[2:29:38] and years
[2:29:40] besides that we already got the Word of
[2:29:42] Promise we got Ishmael
[2:29:45] we've had all kinds of denominational
[2:29:47] moves in the message return Ministry and
[2:29:50] Coleman Thunders and two souls in perusa
[2:29:52] and tape only but none of them have
[2:29:55] produced The Promised son
[2:29:59] all they do is produce wild men
[2:30:02] that won't be subject to the word of God
[2:30:13] well brother Tim but all the promises
[2:30:16] have already been fulfilled because we
[2:30:18] now have a perfect word
[2:30:21] and we can't have those kind of service
[2:30:23] anymore
[2:30:24] this is too hard to believe we've given
[2:30:27] a long up a long time ago thinking we
[2:30:30] can have uh an experience with God like
[2:30:33] that
[2:30:34] this is impossible
[2:30:36] power of God living in us till we speak
[2:30:39] with other tongues
[2:30:40] why you're 99 of message Believers have
[2:30:44] never had a supernatural experience like
[2:30:46] that
[2:30:48] the desire for the Supernatural is long
[2:30:51] gone you know Abraham and I don't don't
[2:30:53] even have a love affair anymore
[2:30:55] there's no pleasure with my Lord
[2:30:57] we're just content with the child of a
[2:31:00] bombs woman just going to church a
[2:31:04] denominational life filling a Pew paying
[2:31:08] their ties
[2:31:10] just believe in the message and saying
[2:31:12] God sent a prophet that's all we know
[2:31:15] about the Holy Ghost
[2:31:18] besides that I'm too old I can never
[2:31:20] feel a baby kick I could never put up
[2:31:24] with it disturbing me
[2:31:27] jumping and dancing and shouting around
[2:31:29] in my womb
[2:31:36] my nerves are shot I don't want none of
[2:31:40] them screaming hollering blabbering Acts
[2:31:43] 2 38 miserable creatures
[2:31:46] why noise makes me nervous
[2:31:52] I can't have none of them old-fashioned
[2:31:54] Sanctified Holy Ghost Field child born
[2:31:58] of the spirit screaming hollering
[2:32:00] shouting praising God Father which
[2:32:02] subset our church order around here I'm
[2:32:05] too set in my ways by now it might keep
[2:32:09] me up all night praying it might turn to
[2:32:11] church into an all-night prayer meeting
[2:32:17] thank you
[2:32:23] foreign
[2:32:34] a true picture of the modern church
[2:32:36] today neither does the modern church one
[2:32:38] in any of these screaming shouting
[2:32:40] tongues speak in Acts 2 38 youngins
[2:32:43] around her yeah yeah yeah she don't want
[2:32:45] any of them whooping and crying and
[2:32:47] screaming amen hallelujah
[2:32:50] oh no I'm too old for that a kid running
[2:32:53] around here it'd keep me up at night
[2:32:57] we don't want no emotion goodness no
[2:32:59] somebody's slain in the spirit why we
[2:33:02] won't have them kind of Tantrums around
[2:33:04] here
[2:33:07] and Jesus the promised son is ushered
[2:33:10] out of his own church
[2:33:15] I said God changed our attitude from
[2:33:18] that bad mood
[2:33:20] foreign
[2:33:22] by being zealous to repent
[2:33:25] amens I will not be lukewarm I will not
[2:33:28] be indifferent I will not be unenthused
[2:33:30] I won't be enough careless attitude but
[2:33:33] let me be zealous not laid back or
[2:33:36] hiding out pouting in the tent sin is
[2:33:39] just too hot and there's too many trials
[2:33:41] but at the temp door
[2:33:44] looking for his appearing God is up to
[2:33:48] something and I can't afford to miss him
[2:33:54] thank you
[2:33:56] Hallelujah
[2:34:03] Sarah hears it
[2:34:05] you're going to have a baby
[2:34:09] you mean a new birth like they had on
[2:34:11] the day of Pentecost
[2:34:13] you mean children born
[2:34:16] you mean and she's snickered
[2:34:19] and she's got
[2:34:21] laughing in her tent yeah
[2:34:24] and unbelief
[2:34:26] at how ridiculous it will be
[2:34:29] for her breasts to be renewed and bring
[2:34:31] milk and nourishment for newborn babies
[2:34:34] but we don't preach baby stuff here
[2:34:40] and to think that she would have
[2:34:41] pleasure with her Lord and enter again
[2:34:43] to the bloom and Spark in her marriage
[2:34:46] like that of a newlywed
[2:34:49] oh it's silly to think I'll ever have my
[2:34:51] first love back like it was when he
[2:34:54] first kissed my heart that's been gone a
[2:34:57] long time ago with me and Abraham
[2:35:00] you know it's really silly to think an
[2:35:03] old crab and arthritic church will dance
[2:35:06] again
[2:35:07] [Applause]
[2:35:11] eyes and a spring in her steps
[2:35:14] that there would be Revival that there
[2:35:17] would be life put into Earth that faith
[2:35:20] and A New Hope in God's power and she
[2:35:24] can believe that there is nothing
[2:35:27] Nate too hard for the Lord
[2:35:32] Hallelujah
[2:35:39] glory to God we've got to have a people
[2:35:41] that come back to believe again there is
[2:35:44] nothing too hard for the Lord no cancer
[2:35:47] no demon no diabetes no point problems
[2:35:51] no sin problem there is nothing too hard
[2:35:54] for the Lord
[2:36:08] all right
[2:36:17] [Music]
[2:36:26] where's this appearing happening at it's
[2:36:28] happening under the oak trees in mammary
[2:36:31] where a bright tree has been restored do
[2:36:34] you think an appearing in A Feast for
[2:36:36] the Lord where we entertain him can
[2:36:39] happen under a tree that the problem the
[2:36:42] canker worm the caterpillar and all of
[2:36:44] that has already eaten it down to snag
[2:36:47] and all that has become is a buzzard
[2:36:50] Roots well even our brother and Roost
[2:36:52] and churches become a cage of every
[2:36:54] unclean and hateful bird and all kinds
[2:36:57] of sin sitting in the pew
[2:37:01] no it's got to be under oak tree where
[2:37:04] he is restored there is Joy back in the
[2:37:07] church there's leaves on the tree
[2:37:11] Hallelujah that Spirit on the tree
[2:37:15] a man there's joy of the camp and when
[2:37:18] the wind blows there the leaves clap
[2:37:21] their hands
[2:37:22] [Applause]
[2:37:23] and the trees get deeper roots and the
[2:37:27] Holy Ghost moves in the church
[2:37:32] foreign
[2:37:43] [Applause]
[2:37:48] there's no such thing as Divine Healing
[2:37:51] oh it's all gone days of Miracles are
[2:37:53] passed
[2:37:55] and God's just pouring out his Spirit
[2:37:57] right over the members anyway
[2:38:00] Hallelujah and is he doing does that
[2:38:02] they say that's fanaticism and then but
[2:38:04] there's a young crop
[2:38:08] a restored crops they got leaves on them
[2:38:12] and the wind blows they fly
[2:38:16] Hallelujah they lift up holy hands to
[2:38:19] God that worship they Praise Him
[2:38:25] Hallelujah they got a Lifeline of faith
[2:38:28] that got too dark they got true Doctrine
[2:38:33] but oh today you know the bark gets heat
[2:38:35] off the tree by the bugs of hell
[2:38:38] amen I'm trying to find a way to get
[2:38:41] here
[2:38:42] but you know
[2:38:45] someone say well brother Tim
[2:38:48] you see we got bark
[2:38:52] we got Doctrine while the seals have
[2:38:54] been opened to us and we have all the
[2:38:57] mystery truths
[2:39:00] do you now Sarah
[2:39:04] you two don't act like it
[2:39:06] in a bad mood
[2:39:08] Surly bitter angry at life laodicea
[2:39:13] lukewarm cold formal
[2:39:18] let me just tell you let me just tell
[2:39:21] you what happens when the book is open
[2:39:24] Revelation 5 and 8 and when he had taken
[2:39:27] the book The Four beasts and the Four
[2:39:29] and Twenty Elders fell down before the
[2:39:31] lamb
[2:39:33] having that one of them hearts and
[2:39:35] golden bodies full of odors which are
[2:39:37] the president that say and they sung a
[2:39:39] new song
[2:39:40] [Applause]
[2:39:42] they didn't sing songs Under bondage
[2:39:45] they didn't sing songs of their failure
[2:39:51] that unbelief they were singing a new
[2:39:54] song Amen but Thou Art Worthy to take
[2:39:58] the book and to open the seals but that
[2:40:01] was slain and has redeemed us to God by
[2:40:04] the blood out of every Kindred and
[2:40:07] tongue and people and nation and has
[2:40:10] made us under God Kings and Priests and
[2:40:13] we shall reign on the Earth
[2:40:14] [Applause]
[2:40:20] Hallelujah
[2:40:24] when the lamb opened the book
[2:40:27] it brought in a time of worship
[2:40:31] and verse 11 said and I heard the voice
[2:40:34] of many angels round about The Throne to
[2:40:36] beasts the elders and the number of them
[2:40:38] was ten thousand times thousand
[2:40:39] thousands of thousands saying with the
[2:40:41] loud voice word to use the lamb that was
[2:40:43] slain for to see Power and riches and
[2:40:45] wisdom and strength and honor and glory
[2:40:47] and blessing and every creature which is
[2:40:49] in the heaven on the earth and under the
[2:40:51] Earth and such as in the sea and all of
[2:40:53] them heard I said blessing and honor and
[2:40:55] glory and power be unto him that set on
[2:40:58] the throne to the lamb forever and ever
[2:41:00] and the four beasts said amen and upon
[2:41:03] the two and twenty Elders fell down and
[2:41:05] worshiped him
[2:41:07] that liveth forever
[2:41:11] [Applause]
[2:41:31] you see Revelation is supposed to have
[2:41:34] stimulation in it
[2:41:36] it's the wine of Revelation remember
[2:41:39] Sarah says I'm too old for that
[2:41:42] it's just emotion
[2:41:44] and brother Brandon says and the
[2:41:46] scientific theory of this modern
[2:41:48] so-called religious groups have tried to
[2:41:50] prove this blessed thing that we have
[2:41:52] called the holy spirit is only emotion
[2:41:56] well see it just don't stand up to their
[2:41:58] scientific theory well I would like to
[2:42:00] ask them what makes them change
[2:42:03] what makes the drunkard stop drinking
[2:42:06] what makes us prostitute cease her evil
[2:42:09] life what makes the cancer and these
[2:42:12] diseases depart from the people and the
[2:42:15] dead deaf and dumb and blind and the
[2:42:17] dead to raise up explain that is that
[2:42:20] emotion
[2:42:21] it has a motion with it certainly
[2:42:26] certainly
[2:42:27] certainly
[2:42:29] anything that's alive has emotion and
[2:42:32] anything that doesn't have emotion is
[2:42:34] dead excuse the expression but I think
[2:42:37] we ought to bury some of our emotionless
[2:42:40] religion here because it's dead it has
[2:42:42] no emotion in any religion that has no
[2:42:45] emotion to be buried because it is
[2:42:49] emotional
[2:42:57] oh if I were you I would constrain him
[2:43:00] tonight
[2:43:01] I'd say come by my pill
[2:43:04] amen and then to the point when them on
[2:43:07] the road to Emmaus They begged him
[2:43:10] to come in
[2:43:12] amen and amen
[2:43:15] I'm trying to get through to a place
[2:43:17] where I can find a resting place for you
[2:43:20] amen you can be seated for a minute I'm
[2:43:22] not through
[2:43:31] part one is complete part two
[2:43:36] [Applause]
[2:43:39] foreign
[2:43:47] just think about that
[2:43:51] you know Abraham washed his feet
[2:43:54] he got water to wash his feet he was
[2:43:56] entertained in Jehovah
[2:43:58] I know of another woman
[2:44:01] that the Bible speaks and said it'll be
[2:44:03] a memorial and it'll be told all over
[2:44:06] the world here in the end time
[2:44:09] did you know brother Branham preached
[2:44:11] that sermon on Jesus with dirty feet
[2:44:14] are you with me amen he preached it all
[2:44:17] over the country he started with pride
[2:44:19] in his own church and our actually in
[2:44:23] Cornersville Indiana there near his own
[2:44:25] church he he uh he got into a lot of
[2:44:28] different things you know
[2:44:30] um that he that he he would preach it on
[2:44:33] about that woman with dirty feet he said
[2:44:35] we've got to entertain Christ
[2:44:39] but you know again Sarah wasn't in the
[2:44:42] mood for this
[2:44:43] your hands when the angel tells her
[2:44:46] she's doubting
[2:44:49] I want you to understand something I
[2:44:52] want to just read just a few little
[2:44:53] quotes about this because you see
[2:44:57] here's the thing
[2:44:58] a lot of times we look at them we say
[2:45:00] well the bride gets out of Step
[2:45:02] and the bride did get out of Step In The
[2:45:04] Vision yeah
[2:45:06] right
[2:45:07] but that did not make them non-bride
[2:45:10] [Music]
[2:45:13] God didn't give up on them
[2:45:19] so what'd he do the prophet screams up
[2:45:21] get back in step
[2:45:23] and he said I saw her get back in step
[2:45:26] and when the world went down the others
[2:45:29] went down this one went up
[2:45:31] somebody with me now
[2:45:33] amen now I want you to think about this
[2:45:36] because you see Sarah
[2:45:40] represents a part of the church that
[2:45:43] wasn't under expectation
[2:45:46] and she laughed at the promise and then
[2:45:49] lied in the face of God saying no I
[2:45:52] never laughed
[2:45:57] but I want you to understand
[2:45:59] God can't leave her out
[2:46:07] he's coming looking for Faith but
[2:46:10] finding none he's going to give her the
[2:46:13] faith
[2:46:14] he's got to turn her heart back to
[2:46:16] believing again
[2:46:20] do you hear what I'm saying God ain't
[2:46:22] giving up on you because he found
[2:46:25] something wrong with you
[2:46:29] God is appearing but turn you around
[2:46:36] they give you a heart to believe because
[2:46:38] the church is going to be there without
[2:46:39] a Rica
[2:46:41] the grace of God will do that it'll have
[2:46:44] to do that
[2:46:45] he said like he talked to Abraham and
[2:46:47] when Sarah doubted him he would have
[2:46:50] slayed slew Sarah right then for her
[2:46:54] doubting
[2:46:55] because that's the worst sin there is is
[2:46:58] unbelief and the only sin and she
[2:47:00] doubted and laughed within herself when
[2:47:03] the angel discerned her through the tent
[2:47:05] is that right but why couldn't he take
[2:47:08] Sarah because she was a part of Abraham
[2:47:12] he would have to take Abraham to and we
[2:47:15] are part of Jesus when we're in the body
[2:47:18] of Christ Our unbeliefs are excused if
[2:47:21] we do it ignorantly like she did first
[2:47:24] she was scared
[2:47:27] you know we get scared it might not be
[2:47:29] real
[2:47:30] we get scared this could be a false hope
[2:47:34] we get scared well you know what will
[2:47:37] other people say about us
[2:47:40] but he can't take her
[2:47:43] without putting a faith in her
[2:47:47] all right and he can't just abandon her
[2:47:49] and just go get another woman
[2:47:53] he's got to get Sarah on board
[2:47:58] thank you
[2:48:00] A Hallelujah
[2:48:03] amen amen said she came and come forward
[2:48:06] and tried to deny it God would have
[2:48:08] destroyed her upon that if she hadn't
[2:48:11] been part of Abraham and a lot of times
[2:48:13] our unbelief would destroy us if it
[2:48:15] wasn't for the blood of Jesus Christ God
[2:48:18] can't destroy us now because the blood
[2:48:21] of Jesus Christ keeps God off of us
[2:48:23] we're part of Christ just as Sarah was a
[2:48:26] part of Abraham for we are the bride of
[2:48:28] Christ and we people who's born of the
[2:48:30] spirit of God ought to wake up and get
[2:48:33] out of her stews and watch for the
[2:48:35] supernatural sign of the coming of the
[2:48:38] Lord Jesus his signs that he's promised
[2:48:44] now brother Branham brings us down to
[2:48:46] individuals and Abraham's Covenant
[2:48:48] confirmed he said now listen I want to
[2:48:50] drop this in because I believe the Holy
[2:48:52] Spirit told me to do it you may be
[2:48:55] sitting there which some of you are I
[2:48:57] know you are
[2:48:59] disagreeing with me right now
[2:49:02] I could call your name
[2:49:05] if you want me to
[2:49:07] so I know that but I also can see
[2:49:12] farther than that
[2:49:14] that you're going to believe it one of
[2:49:16] these days
[2:49:29] Hallelujah
[2:49:31] that may be your husband that may be
[2:49:34] your wife that may be your children that
[2:49:36] may be your loved one
[2:49:40] disagreeing right now but rather be
[2:49:43] encouraged by the prophet of God I can
[2:49:46] see further than that you're going to
[2:49:49] believe
[2:49:51] foreign
[2:49:54] God is not going to give up on you
[2:50:05] he said Sarah just believed and God
[2:50:08] would have rubbed her name off
[2:50:10] but he couldn't do it
[2:50:16] amen he couldn't do it she's a part of
[2:50:18] Abraham
[2:50:20] and and then he he said and if you're
[2:50:23] not really and if you're not been if
[2:50:26] you're really not been excited or worked
[2:50:28] up an emotion I got some church Creed
[2:50:30] but really received the Holy Ghost and
[2:50:33] you're really part of Christ and a
[2:50:35] little skeptic in your mind God will not
[2:50:38] shove you off of that
[2:50:40] from that because he can't you're part
[2:50:42] of Christ he will bring you to the truth
[2:50:48] [Applause]
[2:50:51] he said I hope you people catch it you
[2:50:53] people that believe in God's grace right
[2:50:55] then God would have slew that woman of
[2:50:57] her unbelief he wouldn't have fooled
[2:50:59] with her another minute
[2:51:02] but he said he couldn't do it because
[2:51:05] she's a part of Abraham he would have to
[2:51:08] take Abraham with us and that's where
[2:51:11] Grace comes in all the mistakes are
[2:51:13] arrows god holds us because we're part
[2:51:16] of Christ the grace of God holding us oh
[2:51:19] Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound he
[2:51:22] could not take Sarah because if he did
[2:51:25] he would have to strike Abraham with it
[2:51:28] he cannot take the church in all of its
[2:51:31] mistakes it is still his church
[2:51:38] he can't take it because he's had to
[2:51:40] take Christ he's a part of Christ she
[2:51:42] becomes flesh of his flesh and bone of
[2:51:45] his bone in all our ins and outs and
[2:51:47] unbeliefs and so forth and Scruples as
[2:51:49] long as she's in that body her ups and
[2:51:51] downs but the grace of God still holds
[2:51:55] her
[2:51:58] Hallelujah
[2:52:01] Hallelujah
[2:52:03] let me get down down here just for a
[2:52:05] minute
[2:52:06] now let's just look at this
[2:52:09] here we are here now in the very
[2:52:11] appearing of Jesus Christ
[2:52:14] here he's coming by his church
[2:52:17] let me just go over this for a minute
[2:52:20] brother Brennan would talk about
[2:52:21] entertaining Christ
[2:52:25] and he would talk about
[2:52:27] in the message of Pride and the meanest
[2:52:29] man I know the meanest man in Santa
[2:52:31] Maria meanest man in town he would
[2:52:34] entitle Jesus with dirty feet
[2:52:37] you know Jesus keeps all of his
[2:52:40] appointments
[2:52:44] and the worst sinner in town and the
[2:52:46] worst sinner in town was not the
[2:52:47] prostitute
[2:52:52] the worst sinner in town was the
[2:52:54] Pharisee who wouldn't wash his feet
[2:52:58] who let Jesus sit with dirty feet
[2:53:04] come on Church
[2:53:06] amen and he talks about that woman and
[2:53:09] how she got to him
[2:53:11] and he said I remember when I got to him
[2:53:15] she got hysterical I got hysterical
[2:53:19] he said I wept and I cried and I shouted
[2:53:22] I even spoke in tongues I did all kinds
[2:53:24] of things
[2:53:27] Pharisees they criticized and they
[2:53:30] disbelieved they're the worst sinners in
[2:53:33] town
[2:53:34] the meanest man in the city the meanest
[2:53:38] man in Santa Maria
[2:53:42] but this woman
[2:53:45] who has watched by my feet who has
[2:53:48] entertained me who has anointing me with
[2:53:51] oil who has kissed my feet who has
[2:53:54] washed him with her tears who has
[2:53:56] dreaded with her hair this woman
[2:54:01] all her sins
[2:54:03] which are many are all forgiven
[2:54:06] [Music]
[2:54:15] now what would brother Brown tell us
[2:54:17] that Jesus is going to be the rejected
[2:54:19] Christ
[2:54:20] and the last place he's going to be
[2:54:23] rejected
[2:54:24] is in his own church
[2:54:31] could be on the outside knocking
[2:54:35] under entertain the unwelcomed
[2:54:38] and brother Branham tells us he said to
[2:54:41] Jews dispensation went out
[2:54:43] and the Gentile came in
[2:54:46] because the Jews made fun of the upper
[2:54:49] room experience
[2:54:51] and the coming of the Holy Ghost
[2:54:54] and he said the Gentiles will go out the
[2:54:57] same way with them making fun of the
[2:55:00] Pentecostal experience and the baptism
[2:55:03] of the Holy Ghost
[2:55:06] and he said the gospel will turn from
[2:55:08] the Gentiles back to the Jews
[2:55:10] and he preaches this in the laodicean
[2:55:13] church age Jesus with dirty feet
[2:55:18] the Messiah
[2:55:20] rejecting
[2:55:22] now we're here in this last day this is
[2:55:25] the last place he will be rejected go
[2:55:28] and listen to laodicean church age the
[2:55:31] Gentiles will be cut off by rejecting he
[2:55:34] said Jews condemn themselves by
[2:55:37] blaspheming the Holy Ghost Call in the
[2:55:39] spirit of God an unclean thing
[2:55:40] they made fun of him when they were
[2:55:43] dancing in the spirit on the day of
[2:55:44] Pentecost this is our message
[2:55:47] the message to the angel of the Church
[2:55:49] of laodicea right
[2:55:54] and he said the same thing will happen
[2:55:57] is what happened with the original tree
[2:55:59] he said remember we're the grafted tree
[2:56:02] because they disbelieved the Pentecostal
[2:56:05] message that Paul was preaching and how
[2:56:08] much more in this day when we are
[2:56:09] rejecting the Pentecostal message that's
[2:56:12] come down through the churches how much
[2:56:14] more is God able to take that old wild
[2:56:16] tree off anyway and let another one come
[2:56:18] in because he will reject it because of
[2:56:21] their unbelief
[2:56:22] the Gentile church will be rejected
[2:56:26] but God will get a bride
[2:56:29] don't forget
[2:56:32] and Jesus he said ain't going to stand
[2:56:34] outside your door all the time
[2:56:37] and knock all the time
[2:56:39] no you better let him in he said he said
[2:56:42] don't you compromise with anything less
[2:56:44] than the baptism of the Holy Ghost like
[2:56:46] they got at Pentecost with the same type
[2:56:48] of water baptisms same things they did
[2:56:50] there don't you let nothing put anything
[2:56:52] in your heart less than that
[2:56:57] now so the I'm just I'm just I'm just
[2:57:00] giving you some of these things now
[2:57:02] let's come down
[2:57:05] Sarah the church laughed
[2:57:09] this is ridiculous
[2:57:10] me an old woman
[2:57:12] gonna have Revival
[2:57:14] gonna bring forth a child
[2:57:16] it's past
[2:57:19] we you know even Abraham said let the
[2:57:22] Ishmael live before you
[2:57:26] yeah you know
[2:57:27] and Sarah laughed and God would have
[2:57:30] killed her for lying in his face
[2:57:36] now let's look at just another thing
[2:57:38] Hagar at the same time and her son
[2:57:41] Ishmael made sport
[2:57:44] and laughed at the promised son
[2:57:48] at Isaac's weaning
[2:57:52] and what happened to them
[2:57:54] are you with me
[2:57:57] what happened to them they were cast out
[2:58:03] for laughing at the promise
[2:58:06] and they will laugh at the Holy Ghost
[2:58:08] and will laugh at his gift they will
[2:58:10] laugh at speaking in tongues and
[2:58:12] healings and workings of Miracles and
[2:58:14] mock the word of knowledge they will lie
[2:58:16] and and Scorn at its inspired preaching
[2:58:20] they were live at the revealed Mysteries
[2:58:23] and for laughing the bonds woman and her
[2:58:26] son
[2:58:27] will be cast out
[2:58:31] but I want to talk about Sarah's last
[2:58:35] laugh
[2:58:39] and this time God doesn't rebuke her for
[2:58:41] laughing
[2:58:45] no rebuke this time Genesis 21 verse 6.
[2:58:49] and I'm closing
[2:58:51] and Sarah said God hath made me to laugh
[2:58:55] so that all that hear me will laugh with
[2:58:58] me
[2:58:59] and she said who would have said unto
[2:59:02] Abraham that Sarah said have given
[2:59:04] children suck for I have borne him a son
[2:59:08] it is old age thank you
[2:59:15] Hallelujah this is Sarah's last laugh
[2:59:20] [Applause]
[2:59:24] and she don't get rebuked for it
[2:59:28] her name had been associated with
[2:59:30] baroness a long time that bad woman that
[2:59:35] barren woman Sarah but that's not your
[2:59:37] name anymore Sarah
[2:59:39] Prince's is your name
[2:59:43] Hallelujah you're the mother of a new
[2:59:45] race
[2:59:46] and our name isn't Barren anymore we are
[2:59:50] not the mother of stillborn children who
[2:59:53] claim the message and their lives are
[2:59:55] dead in sin
[2:59:57] and God said I want you to name this boy
[3:00:00] laughter
[3:00:04] and I don't believe it was because Sarah
[3:00:07] giggled and laughed at the ridiculous
[3:00:08] promise an old woman having pleasure
[3:00:10] with her husband again I believe it was
[3:00:12] because God made them to life
[3:00:15] when the Fulfillment of the promise that
[3:00:18] God brought the promise to pass
[3:00:22] there's an old proverb that said he that
[3:00:25] lasts last
[3:00:28] last best
[3:00:37] he that laughs the last laughs blast
[3:00:43] and I just want you to know I'm already
[3:00:46] starting to laugh
[3:00:49] Hallelujah
[3:00:51] God is making his church to life over
[3:00:54] cancer
[3:00:56] to the life of a brain please to laugh
[3:00:59] over alopecia the life over diabetes to
[3:01:03] laugh over sin he's making me laugh when
[3:01:08] I see Sons and Daughters of God and the
[3:01:10] spirit of God poured out upon him he
[3:01:13] makes me alive when I see young and old
[3:01:16] so overcome till they speak in a
[3:01:18] Heavenly language he makes me to laugh
[3:01:21] when I see the devil a pornography bound
[3:01:24] and dead and young people living an
[3:01:27] overcoming life that man
[3:01:34] but I'm about to have the last life

[4:01:40] [Music]
[4:01:57] trolls
[4:02:00] and it is
[4:02:02] [Music]
[4:02:31] last year I was here
[4:02:34] just put an E flat
[4:02:38] I was ministering on thought on God that
[4:02:41] answers
[4:02:43] standing right here in this pulpit
[4:02:46] speaking about when the three Hebrew
[4:02:48] children were walking into the fire
[4:02:50] it was a God who was watching
[4:02:54] and he was mindful of their situation he
[4:02:57] saw exactly where they were at
[4:03:00] now standing right there right there on
[4:03:02] that little platform and I was beginning
[4:03:04] to speak about it and behind me my iPad
[4:03:07] it went completely blank
[4:03:09] and to begin to speak
[4:03:12] there was a prophet's voice
[4:03:15] interestingly he was out of a sermon
[4:03:17] the worst sinner in the city
[4:03:21] and his voice began to speak and he said
[4:03:23] my favorite hymn
[4:03:26] my friend brother Booth Cleburn wrote
[4:03:29] that on his knees by inspiration in a
[4:03:32] cornfield one night with a pace board
[4:03:34] pieces in the bottom of his shoes for
[4:03:37] Souls on his shoes
[4:03:39] said he sold it for a hundred dollars
[4:03:42] and he's taken the copyright of this
[4:03:43] song but that's my favorite of the hymns
[4:03:46] it expresses the extreme deity of the
[4:03:51] Lord Jesus Christ
[4:03:53] especially in a day like this when they
[4:03:57] try to make him just a prophet but he
[4:04:00] was more than a prophet he was God
[4:04:05] the Lord would give me a very real
[4:04:07] Assurance he was with me I would go home
[4:04:11] and I would fly home in just a few weeks
[4:04:13] and my mom would go back into the
[4:04:15] hospital and she would never come out
[4:04:17] again
[4:04:19] but as I went into her room she hadn't
[4:04:21] spoke for almost 18 24 hours
[4:04:24] and it almost comatose
[4:04:28] situation in her life
[4:04:31] me and my dad walked in that room and we
[4:04:33] began to talk to her and she just kind
[4:04:35] of looked at us we prayed for her and he
[4:04:38] dad went into the into the into the
[4:04:41] restroom and I just looked at her and I
[4:04:43] got right down in her face and said Mom
[4:04:46] I said I come to tell you
[4:04:48] he has come down
[4:04:50] and he's with us in this fire
[4:04:53] and out of her mouth she began to sing
[4:04:55] these words
[4:04:58] down from his glory
[4:05:01] this is a Psalm brother was talking
[4:05:03] about down from his glory every living
