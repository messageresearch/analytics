[46:16] die and he said all i could do was pray
[46:19] amen thank god that god hears

[46:25] so thankful
[46:26] for what he is doing so many that are
[46:28] sick and want to remember them in prayer
[46:31] they prayed for a friend of mine this
[46:33] morning billy owens he was a
[46:35] i
[46:36] i don't think he's ever been here but
[46:37] he's just been a precious friend of mine
[46:40] they're actually transporting him right
[46:41] now from giles to uva
[46:44] he has a brain bleed it's very serious
[46:46] condition i don't think he i don't think
[46:48] he can talk
[46:50] but he's tr
[46:51] but he is uh
[46:53] but he is uh able to function to text
[46:56] and and so i just text him just a moment
[46:59] ago just before just to let him to know
[47:01] that we were going to have prayer for
[47:03] him
[47:04] prayer works
[47:07] there's a lady from brother biskell
[47:09] she's a precious sister i've known him
[47:10] for i've known her for many many years
[47:13] she sent me a wonderful letter and i'm
[47:14] not going to take the time to read it
[47:16] but she sent me a wonderful
[47:19] letter
[47:19] she felt led to
[47:21] to buy this tie for me and then send it
[47:25] to the men's prayer meeting and on a
[47:27] friday night they prayed for it
[47:29] and she sent it to me and so
[47:32] today i'm wearing it and i just sent
[47:34] brother tom a message
[47:36] that i am wearing the tie that you guys
[47:38] prayed for today so may god heal my body
[47:42] as i preach the word
[47:44] amen so we want to
[47:46] we want to we want to thank them sister
[47:48] margaret is a precious person and she
[47:50] actually in that letter talks about two
[47:53] different prayer lines that she was in
[47:55] and god just touched the very needs of
[47:57] her heart
[47:58] amen so we want to remember her as well
[48:02] deep on my heart today is the churches
[48:04] of ukraine
[48:06] and uh
[48:08] we're
[48:08] you know we have a lot of believers that
[48:10] are in the ukraine actually brother
[48:12] biscuit is of ukrainian descent
[48:15] and uh they're they're precious people
[48:18] just really precious people i've been
[48:20] able to keep in contact with brother
[48:22] robert fisher
[48:23] that was here and he's in poland and
[48:26] he's keeping in contact with the
[48:27] ukrainian people
[48:29] and so i would like for you to remember
[48:31] them in prayer
[48:32] we realize that prophecy is going to be
[48:34] fulfilled
[48:36] the same the same
[48:39] words that come for them come for us
[48:43] and we believe before one great big bomb
[48:45] is dropped we'll be gone in the rapture
[48:47] and so
[48:49] many of those people are already on the
[48:51] move to leave ukraine
[48:54] and
[48:54] so let's just pray for them that god
[48:56] would just have them when you hear these
[48:58] political things happening you realize
[49:00] they're only rattling the saber
[49:05] they're only rattling the saber
[49:08] and uh
[49:09] and and russia and china
[49:11] and and those countries will fulfill
[49:16] they will fulfill
[49:18] as much
[49:20] as much as our nation
[49:23] and donald trump
[49:25] placed jerusalem as a
[49:28] as the the capital of israel
[49:32] and israel came back in as a nation
[49:35] god's going to have a bride
[49:40] god's going to have a bride and
[49:42] i i just was looking at some things this
[49:45] morning four
[49:46] different prophets in the old testament
[49:49] talked about how the jerusalem would be
[49:51] the capital of israel
[49:54] and here we had a had a uh a president
[49:57] come in
[49:58] this election it's not about republican
[50:00] and democrat god's got a job to do
[50:03] and you move that move that and you
[50:05] think well all of the other presidents
[50:07] didn't do it but this one did
[50:09] well you see the prophecy has to be
[50:11] fulfilled
[50:13] and so we are at the time and i believe
[50:15] i'm preaching to a group of people and i
[50:17] want to speak to you this morning
[50:20] god has not brought us here
[50:23] for us to lose the battle
[50:28] hallelujah i love you with all of my
[50:31] hearts and and we want to remember them

[54:19] to have each and every one of you
[54:21] amen i'd like to speak to you something
[54:24] the lord spoke to me the other morning
[54:26] about two weeks ago
[54:28] i was putting wood in my
[54:31] in my
[54:32] wood stove
[54:34] and as i was putting it in an audible
[54:37] voice sometimes it's an impression in
[54:39] your heart but an audible voice spoke to
[54:42] me and it just took me i actually wrote
[54:44] it down very quickly so i made sure that
[54:46] i got it right
[54:48] and uh i'm going to share with you this
[54:50] morning my thoughts from these things
[54:53] he has sent not sent me
[54:56] to this battle
[54:58] to lose
[55:00] this battle
[55:02] so we're going to talk about more than
[55:04] cancer we're going to talk about rapture
[55:07] we're going to talk about laodicea he's
[55:09] not sent you to this battle
[55:11] for you to lose to this battle
[55:14] is that all right
[55:16] amen
[55:19] and jesse said unto david his son
[55:22] take now
[55:24] for thy brethren an ephon
[55:27] and a parchment of corn
[55:29] and these ten loaves
[55:31] and run to the camp to thy brethren
[55:34] and carry these ten cheeses unto the
[55:37] captain of their thousand
[55:40] and look now thy brethren fair
[55:45] look how my brethren fair
[55:47] and take their pledge
[55:49] now saul and they and all the men
[55:53] of jerusalem
[55:54] were in the valley of
[55:57] elah fighting with philistines
[56:00] and david rose up early in the morning
[56:03] and left the sheep with with a keeper
[56:06] and took and went as jesse had commanded
[56:09] and he commanded
[56:10] and he came to the trench
[56:12] as the host was going forth
[56:15] to fight
[56:16] and shouted for the battle
[56:19] for israel and the philistines had put
[56:22] the battle in array army
[56:25] against army
[56:26] and david left his carriage and the hand
[56:29] of of the keeper of the carriage and ran
[56:32] into the army and came and saluted his
[56:34] brethren and as he talked with them
[56:36] behold there came
[56:38] up the champion the philistine of gath
[56:41] goliath by name how the armies of the
[56:44] philistines spake according to the words
[56:48] to the to the same words and david heard
[56:51] them and that's quite a big statement
[56:53] and david heard them goliath would have
[56:55] been incredibly in good shape but david
[56:59] heard them
[57:01] and all the men of israel when they saw
[57:04] the man fled from him and and were sore
[57:07] afraid
[57:09] and the men of israel said have you seen
[57:11] this man that has come up surely to defy
[57:15] israel is come up and it shall be that
[57:18] the man who killeth him the king will
[57:20] enrich him with great riches and will
[57:23] give him his daughter and make his
[57:26] make his father's house free in israel
[57:30] and david spake to the men that stood by
[57:32] him saying
[57:34] what shall be done to the man that
[57:36] killeth this philistine and taketh away
[57:39] the reproach from israel
[57:41] who is this uncircumcising
[57:45] that he should defy the armies
[57:48] of the living
[57:50] god
[57:51] you may be seated this morning
[58:00] david's arrival was a very bad thing for
[58:04] for goliath
[58:06] your arrival to this end time age is a
[58:09] very bad time thing for this satan's
[58:12] eden
[58:14] condition
[58:16] you're the people that are bone of this
[58:18] bone life of his life and power of his
[58:21] power
[58:22] you're more than the words that were in
[58:25] sermons that were preached from 1947 to
[58:29] 1965
[58:31] you're more than just quotations you're
[58:33] more than just just good powerful good
[58:36] powerful lyrics of the message but you
[58:39] are the physical attributes of god
[58:43] that god thought of before the
[58:45] foundation of the world
[58:47] and he knew to send you to this hour
[58:56] i want you to think about that this is
[58:58] your battle
[59:01] and david was sent to this battle
[59:05] god in his great orchestration knew
[59:08] exactly who to sin they had a
[59:10] backslidden king they had rejected they
[59:13] had the sons of kish that was there they
[59:16] had all their fine intellectual
[59:18] condition but that wouldn't defeat
[59:20] goliath
[59:22] you can have all your intellectualism
[59:24] you can have the intellectualism of the
[59:26] message but you got to have a holy ghost
[59:28] inside of you
[59:31] that same god
[59:33] that lived here 2 000 years ago that
[59:36] worked in the prophet of god that stood
[59:38] here night after night defeating the
[59:41] devil that's the same god that wants to
[59:44] live inside of you and accept the
[59:46] challenge of this hour
[59:48] [Music]
[59:50] are you with me now
[59:54] our god reigns
[59:58] our god has never lost the battle
[1:00:07] i wonder how disappointed the devil felt
[1:00:11] when he didn't get the body of moses
[1:00:19] even in the scriptures of jude
[1:00:21] there's still a disruption in an
[1:00:23] argument going on about the body of
[1:00:26] moses i want to send him a warning
[1:00:30] he's about to feel the same way again
[1:00:34] there's a tens of thousands times
[1:00:36] thousands times thousands of us
[1:00:40] around the world
[1:00:42] that is not going to get our bodies
[1:00:45] [Applause]
[1:00:46] our bodies are not going to go to the
[1:00:48] grave
[1:00:50] we are the alive and remain group and
[1:00:53] we're standing here victorious
[1:00:58] victorious with the message
[1:01:00] proclaiming it loud and strong
[1:01:03] we have not been sent to this battle to
[1:01:07] lose this battle
[1:01:12] i imagine as the reports will go back to
[1:01:14] hell
[1:01:15] them people that you sent us to torment
[1:01:18] today they're gone
[1:01:28] i want that to just settle in
[1:01:30] because we're coming to that point
[1:01:32] there's armies just literally on a on
[1:01:35] just a almost a hair trigger ready
[1:01:38] to fight an army
[1:01:40] fight a battle and don't know that the
[1:01:42] fulfillment of the word of the hour is
[1:01:45] taking place
[1:01:49] when david stepped off of the
[1:01:53] off of the hillside that day
[1:01:56] none of his comrades went with him
[1:02:03] nobody else went with him sometimes
[1:02:06] people want to they want 10 000 people
[1:02:09] around them for security
[1:02:11] there's sometimes you've got to stand
[1:02:14] [Music]
[1:02:15] there's times in your home that you've
[1:02:17] got to say no that will not come in here
[1:02:20] we don't listen to that kind of music
[1:02:23] we don't dress that way you got to tell
[1:02:25] yourself that way
[1:02:26] you got to look himself in the mirror
[1:02:28] and say that don't work
[1:02:33] sometimes you've got to resist this
[1:02:35] laodicean spirit and push back
[1:02:43] brother joel just brought me a plaque of
[1:02:46] the man in the arena
[1:02:50] it's a favorite it's a favorite speech
[1:02:52] of mine
[1:02:54] and in the opening
[1:02:56] opening statement it said it's not the
[1:02:58] critic
[1:03:00] that counts
[1:03:02] there will always be observers on the
[1:03:05] sideline telling you how to do it
[1:03:08] they'll do it with their computer
[1:03:10] they'll do it with their iphones they'll
[1:03:11] do it with their their voices
[1:03:14] but they'll never get their hands dirty
[1:03:20] are you with me so many times if we're
[1:03:22] not careful we'll become spectators in
[1:03:24] church and expect a revival and not call
[1:03:27] for it ourselves
[1:03:30] we'll come to church and put nothing in
[1:03:32] and walk out of service wasn't that a
[1:03:34] dud
[1:03:37] you only get out of it what you put in
[1:03:42] [Music]
[1:03:44] david had been in preparation for this
[1:03:46] battle
[1:03:48] david had been taking care of sheep
[1:03:51] and when he comes to saul he begins to
[1:03:54] give him testimony
[1:03:56] about a lion
[1:03:59] and a bear
[1:04:01] who both represents kings
[1:04:04] and powers
[1:04:05] and god had gave him a lion and gave him
[1:04:08] a bear
[1:04:10] and he knew that the same god he wasn't
[1:04:12] able to do with his own human flesh but
[1:04:15] the same god was able to give him this
[1:04:19] uncircumcised philistine
[1:04:22] because the principle of his belief was
[1:04:24] his god was greater
[1:04:27] and his god was alive and all that god
[1:04:30] needed was somebody in his hand that god
[1:04:34] could use
[1:04:36] and he had surrendered himself into that
[1:04:39] hand
[1:04:42] oh god help us tonight
[1:04:46] hallelujah
[1:04:49] the scripture says our god is a law a
[1:04:51] mighty god
[1:04:53] who saves us over and over
[1:04:56] the lord yahweh rescues us from the ways
[1:05:00] of death many times
[1:05:02] and he will crush every enemy
[1:05:04] shattering them
[1:05:06] he will make heads roll for they refuse
[1:05:09] to repent of their stubborn sinful ways
[1:05:13] stupid devil
[1:05:16] ephesians chapter 6 tells us finally my
[1:05:19] brethren be strong in the lord and the
[1:05:20] power of his might
[1:05:22] and put on the whole armor of god
[1:05:25] that you may be able to stand against
[1:05:27] the wiles of the devil
[1:05:29] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[1:05:31] blood and against principalities and
[1:05:34] against powers against the rulers of the
[1:05:36] darkness of this world and against
[1:05:38] spiritual wickedness in high places
[1:05:41] now notice all of this is happening now
[1:05:44] he tells you wherefore taken to you the
[1:05:46] whole armor
[1:05:49] the whole armor of god that you may be
[1:05:51] able to withstand
[1:05:53] in the
[1:05:54] evil day
[1:05:55] and haven't done all to stand stand
[1:06:02] brother ron i haven't done nothing
[1:06:04] what you might say great you're still
[1:06:06] standing
[1:06:09] you haven't walked away
[1:06:12] you're still standing
[1:06:15] hallelujah
[1:06:18] paul would write this from a dungeon
[1:06:23] and we know that all things work
[1:06:24] together
[1:06:26] for the good
[1:06:28] to them that love god
[1:06:30] to them who are the called according to
[1:06:34] his purpose
[1:06:36] and and for whom he did for know he also
[1:06:38] did predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:06:40] image of his son that he might be the
[1:06:42] firstborn among many brethren and
[1:06:44] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[1:06:47] he also called
[1:06:49] and whom he called them he also
[1:06:51] justified and whom he justified them he
[1:06:54] also glorified if god called david to do
[1:06:57] the job
[1:06:59] [Music]
[1:07:02] don't let the devil whisper in your ear
[1:07:05] full of doubt
[1:07:07] stand like you've never stood before god
[1:07:10] chose you
[1:07:12] not a president not a dictator not some
[1:07:15] hollywood star god chose you
[1:07:21] i like some things that andrew i liked
[1:07:23] everything andrew said but there were
[1:07:24] some things that andrew said last night
[1:07:27] about this reality nonsense that's in
[1:07:29] the world
[1:07:33] it's just like they have these singing
[1:07:35] they they try to solicit these singing
[1:07:38] stars to come up and they win this prize
[1:07:40] uh
[1:07:41] american idol
[1:07:43] that's the most damnable thing that
[1:07:45] could happen to that person
[1:07:47] what they don't realize they got a
[1:07:49] record label but they just sold their
[1:07:51] soul
[1:07:57] are you with me
[1:08:02] remember hollywood is satan's seat
[1:08:06] it's satan's seat
[1:08:09] and what it is is the inspiration from
[1:08:12] hollywood is from hell itself
[1:08:16] literally
[1:08:18] through your screens
[1:08:21] trying to defile the word of god
[1:08:25] by
[1:08:26] literally searing consciences
[1:08:29] of humanity
[1:08:32] and allowing the sodom and gomorrah h
[1:08:40] to be commonplace
[1:08:42] to where you don't resist it anymore
[1:08:48] to where crossdressing's okay
[1:08:54] i know you'll get quiet for a moment
[1:08:58] but women's been cross-dressing a long
[1:09:00] time
[1:09:07] they've been doing it a long time
[1:09:10] and they seared the conscience
[1:09:13] and that conscience
[1:09:15] as it is seared
[1:09:17] it becomes a gray area
[1:09:22] if you're not careful
[1:09:24] the spirit in you will become subdued to
[1:09:26] where you don't even call out against it
[1:09:29] anymore
[1:09:31] before long it becomes to a place to
[1:09:33] where that
[1:09:34] it's acceptable in your home
[1:09:38] listen two men two women will never be
[1:09:40] acceptable in the word of god
[1:09:48] you got to remember the reason why that
[1:09:50] god's going to destroy america
[1:09:54] he's going to destroy it
[1:09:56] because of the sodom condition
[1:10:00] and remember this it's not just america
[1:10:03] that's going to be destroyed for that
[1:10:05] that spirit is around the world
[1:10:09] and it's a spirit of death
[1:10:16] you didn't mind me
[1:10:18] killing goliath but
[1:10:20] but isn't that amazing how you get quiet
[1:10:22] when i start on that layout of seeing
[1:10:24] spirit
[1:10:29] i'm going to
[1:10:32] the scripture says all power
[1:10:35] sin heaven and earth is given into my
[1:10:37] hand
[1:10:39] go and i'll go with you
[1:10:41] whatever you bind on earth
[1:10:44] shall be bound in heaven
[1:10:48] whatever you tell
[1:10:50] the devil no to
[1:10:52] and bind him
[1:10:54] as you apply the token as you do things
[1:10:56] into your own life
[1:10:59] you got to just re-keep reapplying
[1:11:02] you just got to keep praying
[1:11:06] young people i want to say this my
[1:11:08] prayers are with you
[1:11:10] because you face it in your schools you
[1:11:13] face it in your textbooks
[1:11:19] the writers of the textbooks they're
[1:11:21] inspired from another dimension
[1:11:25] listen a first grader don't need to be
[1:11:27] learning about sex
[1:11:33] don't go stick your head in the sand now
[1:11:35] and say well you know that's another
[1:11:36] person's deal to do we're parents we got
[1:11:39] to rise up against those things
[1:11:40] [Applause]
[1:11:48] are you with me
[1:11:49] let's let men be real men
[1:11:53] women be real ladies
[1:12:00] sodom and gomorrah is everywhere
[1:12:03] what we are seeing today in our news and
[1:12:06] what we're seeing that's going on around
[1:12:07] us is the
[1:12:09] harvest
[1:12:10] of the seeds that have been sown
[1:12:14] weak pulpits
[1:12:17] weak pulpits that sold out for the money
[1:12:20] or popularity
[1:12:23] or denominational systems
[1:12:25] that place boundaries upon them
[1:12:28] to where that pulpit became bridled
[1:12:34] brother branham felt that bridle
[1:12:37] he felt them trying to stop him from
[1:12:39] telling women how they needed to dress
[1:12:41] or telling men how they needed to
[1:12:43] conduct themselves
[1:12:46] when he's preaching in future home and
[1:12:48] he spends the first 45 minutes to an
[1:12:50] hour on the conduct of people that will
[1:12:53] live in that new city
[1:12:55] it's important that conduct won't start
[1:12:58] when the rapture happens it's got to
[1:13:00] happen now
[1:13:02] and i believe you as this body of
[1:13:04] believers i you're you're real believers

[1:13:08] stone to throw in any of you but i want
[1:13:10] you to understand we represent this
[1:13:13] message

[1:13:47] year this is not my home

[1:13:55] the dimensions of hell and the
[1:13:56] dimensions of heaven are
[1:13:58] blending we can see
[1:14:01] men without any reason at all
[1:14:04] going into homes going into schools

[1:14:12] on the internet may not know this but in
[1:14:14] our community here we are grieving
[1:14:16] because of two precious officers who
[1:14:19] many of us knew
[1:14:21] were innocently taken their lives
[1:14:25] they had homes they had families they
[1:14:27] had great lives they were great men
[1:14:30] but some demon-possessed
[1:14:34] idiot from hell

[1:16:43] destroys relationships with children
[1:16:50] innocent things seemably
[1:16:52] happen
[1:16:53] and will destroy some of the best
[1:16:55] churches that there is

[1:17:39] volcanoes are going off
[1:17:42] we don't need another sign we'll not get
[1:17:44] another messenger
[1:17:46] sodom is here the conditions are here
[1:17:49] every biblical prophecy has taken place
[1:17:53] smart cars are everywhere
[1:17:56] uh we don't have to wait for that vision
[1:17:58] to be fulfilled women has done what
[1:18:00] they've done every one of those visions
[1:18:02] except for bombs dropping over america i
[1:18:05] don't want to be here for that
[1:18:15] people want to argue with brother brown
[1:18:16] i'm a prophet will you stay around long
[1:18:18] enough you'll become a believer
[1:18:23] they want to argue with noah was he a
[1:18:25] prophet or not just stay around long
[1:18:27] enough
[1:18:28] if you get to live long enough you'll
[1:18:30] see he was the real deal
[1:18:33] when jesus was hanging between heaven
[1:18:35] and hell
[1:18:37] i want you to just look at it just for a
[1:18:39] moment here stands two men hanging on a
[1:18:42] cross on either side justly
[1:18:46] they were justly there one recognizes
[1:18:50] jesus to be god himself the messiah
[1:18:54] and he says some precious words remember
[1:18:56] me
[1:18:59] remember we when you come into paradise
[1:19:01] let me just say when jesus said this day
[1:19:04] you'll speak be with me in paradise
[1:19:10] let's give i was giving great thought
[1:19:14] to that this week
[1:19:18] now i'm going to come home here in just
[1:19:19] a second
[1:19:28] what if they untied those men and let
[1:19:30] them down off of the cross
[1:19:33] one man will go right back to becoming a
[1:19:36] terrorist
[1:19:39] one man is going to go right back to his
[1:19:41] ways of wickedness
[1:19:44] but one man
[1:19:46] would become the pillar of a community
[1:19:49] and the church
[1:19:54] how many people sit on our pews today
[1:19:58] pews across the world and hear the
[1:20:01] message of the hour
[1:20:03] the word will change you one way or
[1:20:05] another
[1:20:08] don't tell me that you're not going to
[1:20:11] change one way or the other
[1:20:14] the word's going to move you in one
[1:20:16] direction maybe the enemy will only try
[1:20:20] to numb you
[1:20:24] not reject
[1:20:26] but numb you
[1:20:34] i just had a cancer burned off of my
[1:20:36] face
[1:20:39] and dr cropley put a spoon across my eye
[1:20:43] and then they they began to spray it and
[1:20:45] they sprayed it and sprayed it i didn't
[1:20:47] flinch
[1:20:50] he looked at me said you're one tough
[1:20:52] human being
[1:20:54] i said well i've had a lot of things
[1:20:56] done to this body he said generally we
[1:20:57] have people crying we have people
[1:20:59] hollering we have all different kind of
[1:21:00] reactions and
[1:21:02] i watched you you never even flinched
[1:21:08] well
[1:21:09] that's great
[1:21:13] but when i go to the dentist
[1:21:20] i get laughing gas
[1:21:24] i give them i get i actually ask for
[1:21:27] extra shots
[1:21:30] so that when they start dealing down
[1:21:32] getting down in my gums and
[1:21:34] pulling teeth or doing root canals i
[1:21:37] don't want to feel it
[1:21:40] it's due to the novocaine or the numbing
[1:21:44] that they put in there
[1:21:47] well brother ron uh i'm just tough well
[1:21:50] i just chose a long time ago
[1:21:52] sitting in a dentist chair is not a
[1:21:54] place for me to be the champion
[1:22:05] it's not the place for me to show how
[1:22:08] hero i am
[1:22:10] it's a good place for numbing
[1:22:19] i'm tough brother ron probably because
[1:22:21] you don't want to pay the bill
[1:22:27] and i've got news for you when you die
[1:22:29] naked you came into the world naked
[1:22:31] you're going to leave

[1:23:01] kind of talking to me about ties how
[1:23:03] difficult times was to pay and i said
[1:23:05] you know i'm amazed this is not a
[1:23:06] believer but i i'm amazed that people

[1:23:12] got their money in an ira
[1:23:15] and they just signed the bill the other
[1:23:17] day to where they're going to start

[1:23:56] well that was another goliath that i
[1:23:58] just killed i don't know where you know
[1:24:00] it or not

[1:25:59] don't know which way is up and which way
[1:26:01] is down
[1:26:03] and i want to give you the reason why we
[1:26:05] did that is we turned the message down
[1:26:08] amen
[1:26:12] you say well brother ron a lot of people
[1:26:14] don't know about brother brown let me
[1:26:15] let me just today is alden's birthday

[1:26:37] now brother alden is the one seated he's
[1:26:39] standing beside of the seated brother
[1:26:41] josh
[1:26:44] but josh is still almost as tall as
[1:26:46] brother halvin's seated
[1:26:51] now it's not an accident that brother
[1:26:53] alden is here
[1:26:56] brother homer
[1:26:59] the founder of this church when he came
[1:27:01] to the message
[1:27:03] he stood against a lot of resistance
[1:27:07] it was not popular it's not popular now
[1:27:09] but it's not popular then
[1:27:11] and he stood and preached water baptism
[1:27:13] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:27:15] that one god he preached this message
[1:27:17] with all of his heart
[1:27:18] and he did it with extreme passion and
[1:27:21] extreme power
[1:27:23] and and his legacy is is is outstanding
[1:27:27] today and he stands with generals
[1:27:34] brother vernon
[1:27:36] stood with brother homer
[1:27:40] with great opposition
[1:27:43] i want you to think about your choices
[1:27:46] just for a moment
[1:27:48] god led him to make that choice by
[1:27:51] election of a predestinated seed
[1:27:54] but still the humanity had to stand
[1:27:59] and feel the arrows
[1:28:01] but i'd like for brother vernon's family
[1:28:04] to stand
[1:28:06] family extended family
[1:28:18] i'd like all the frasers to stand the
[1:28:20] extended family and family
[1:28:26] thomas you don't have to stand you're
[1:28:27] good bacteria
[1:28:32] do you realize that you're a result
[1:28:35] of a choice somebody made
[1:28:41] thank you
[1:28:47] you're a pillar in a community
[1:28:52] i don't know i'm not gonna get done but
[1:28:54] i'm just gonna this is all right that's
[1:28:56] okay
[1:28:57] that'll teach the devil to make me dizzy
[1:29:02] i want you to think
[1:29:05] what if brother vernon would have chosen
[1:29:07] an easier way
[1:29:11] what if you would have chosen an easier
[1:29:13] way
[1:29:19] when people walk away from the message
[1:29:20] it don't take many generations
[1:29:23] to see that they fall off of a cliff
[1:29:26] and they do things that they never
[1:29:28] thought they'd do
[1:29:32] never dreamed that they would do
[1:29:34] because this word's not holding you
[1:29:40] are you with me when you walk away from
[1:29:42] the word it will not hold you no longer
[1:29:46] you leave the protection
[1:29:52] are you with me now
[1:29:54] listen when you when you're making
[1:29:56] choices even now
[1:29:59] maybe you're not the brother vernon but
[1:30:01] you're making choices right now as a
[1:30:03] young man and a young dad think about
[1:30:05] the children that are not born
[1:30:10] think about the children that are going
[1:30:12] to come
[1:30:13] you
[1:30:14] are a pillar of a family
[1:30:17] young people think about the homes that
[1:30:19] you're going to be stepping into don't
[1:30:22] mar your testimony
[1:30:25] don't mar your life as a young person
[1:30:29] with the world and all of its
[1:30:30] entrapments
[1:30:32] let the word keep you
[1:30:44] that's why we have meetings
[1:30:47] like louisiana that's why we have
[1:30:49] meetings like here that are calling for
[1:30:52] more of the holy ghost in our life
[1:30:54] a real experience
[1:30:58] a real experience
[1:31:00] that will be the type host in your life
[1:31:03] that you can point back
[1:31:06] where god i'm talking about a personal
[1:31:09] supernatural experience not a learned
[1:31:13] behavior
[1:31:22] i know what a supernatural experience is
[1:31:25] like
[1:31:30] many years ago as a young man my life
[1:31:32] was a mess
[1:31:36] now i'm just going to
[1:31:37] share it with you my life was a mess
[1:31:42] i'd made some bad choices
[1:31:45] and it had taken me away from the
[1:31:46] presence of god
[1:31:50] i was homeless
[1:31:53] i was making really bad choices
[1:31:56] i was working
[1:31:58] because i knew the fundamental thing if
[1:31:59] you want to have money i obviously
[1:32:01] wasn't living in this time but if you
[1:32:03] want to have money you got to work
[1:32:07] people need to get up and go to work
[1:32:09] that's what they need to do
[1:32:14] well brother ron i i want the government
[1:32:15] to take listen the government's not
[1:32:17] going to always be here
[1:32:26] brother homer preached that night
[1:32:32] and he preached the sermon
[1:32:34] what will the holy ghost mean in your
[1:32:37] life
[1:32:39] and the theme of that was he'll be your
[1:32:41] god
[1:32:43] he'll be the light in front of your
[1:32:45] footsteps
[1:32:47] he will help you with your choices
[1:32:49] and you need to know more than just the
[1:32:51] message
[1:32:53] you need to know christ himself
[1:32:56] the very spirit of christ
[1:32:59] and he'll be there when you give up
[1:33:03] that was the theme of brother homer's
[1:33:05] sermon that night
[1:33:06] and i sat there as a message believer
[1:33:09] now back in church
[1:33:16] married
[1:33:19] and i i went to a place because i was
[1:33:21] just so ashamed
[1:33:23] of ron
[1:33:25] and i went to a place near
[1:33:27] sister dawn and near the piano
[1:33:30] you remember it was an upright piano
[1:33:32] and had i believe it had a curtain on it
[1:33:36] and i got down and i began to pray
[1:33:43] brother bill came and
[1:33:45] wrapped his arms around me like a bear
[1:33:49] and he began to pray for me
[1:33:54] and i began to pray these words
[1:33:58] god i need more than my mom's experience
[1:34:03] i need more than my dad's experience
[1:34:07] i need an experience of my own
[1:34:11] i knew the message i knew the words i
[1:34:13] knew the lyrics i knew all of the the
[1:34:16] powerful quotes
[1:34:18] but i didn't have christ
[1:34:21] i didn't have that anointing of the holy
[1:34:23] ghost living inside of me
[1:34:27] brother bill was holding me
[1:34:30] he couldn't give me the holy ghost
[1:34:32] but he was there and the support
[1:34:36] that's what we need as men and women in
[1:34:38] this church to support our young people
[1:34:40] and pray with them
[1:34:42] until they get an experience
[1:34:45] for themselves because every generation
[1:34:49] has got to have its own revival
[1:34:51] [Applause]
[1:34:53] [Music]
[1:34:58] that night i walked out of that building
[1:35:01] changed
[1:35:06] we can talk about matthew at the
[1:35:07] louisiana camp
[1:35:09] when they came to me in the middle of
[1:35:11] the night your son's still speaking in
[1:35:13] tongues i wasn't ashamed
[1:35:16] amen matthew's still speaking in tongues
[1:35:18] he's a great big boy and we had to carry
[1:35:20] him to his bed
[1:35:22] weighed about 250 at that time
[1:35:24] that boy
[1:35:27] was was speaking and comes i tell you
[1:35:30] why i rejoiced
[1:35:34] hundreds it came to the altar but my son
[1:35:37] received the holy ghost because i knew
[1:35:39] without it he couldn't hold on
[1:35:45] i said in the office when colleges were
[1:35:48] making their offers
[1:35:50] and he walked in the office and sat down
[1:35:52] beside my my desk and he said
[1:35:54] dad football's over
[1:35:59] it's over
[1:36:07] you don't know how proud that may be
[1:36:10] i was proud when he
[1:36:12] when he was sacked a quarterback i was
[1:36:13] proud when he would do his things but i
[1:36:15] was more proud that he chose god
[1:36:20] you want me to be proud of you young
[1:36:21] people you want me to be proud of you
[1:36:23] parents
[1:36:24] when you choose god
[1:36:28] when you step off of the realm
[1:36:30] when there's nobody else there with you
[1:36:32] when you step off of the hill that day
[1:36:34] and you choose god
[1:36:37] [Applause]
[1:36:38] let me just say this you god can heal
[1:36:41] you raise you up
[1:36:43] take you from death's door and that be a
[1:36:45] miracle but there's listen you can go
[1:36:48] and live a sinful life
[1:36:51] and not even have any redemption to you
[1:36:53] just because he heals you don't mean
[1:36:55] that he saved you at the same moment
[1:36:58] but what you need is you must be born
[1:37:01] again
[1:37:03] and it's more than a formula it's more
[1:37:06] than just good quotes it's more than
[1:37:09] learned behavior it's a supernatural
[1:37:12] experience where god himself
[1:37:15] feels you
[1:37:17] he's he's took those devils out of your
[1:37:20] life and he's washed you clean and he
[1:37:23] comes and lives in a vessel
[1:37:34] brother ron that's real elementary some
[1:37:35] of you are facing some
[1:37:37] end time battles
[1:37:39] let me tell you about wars wars will
[1:37:41] happen on a lot of fronts
[1:37:48] the enemy will get your mind in a whole
[1:37:49] lot of different directions
[1:37:53] and i'm going to be personal right here
[1:37:55] at my home i've got a box of medicine
[1:37:57] it's about that big it's got 20 i take
[1:37:59] 20 pills in the morning
[1:38:01] then i take more
[1:38:03] chemo in the afternoon
[1:38:05] you better have faith
[1:38:08] you better have faith when you're
[1:38:10] putting all of that in your system i
[1:38:12] just talked to a pharmacist last week
[1:38:14] and he was telling me he said you are a
[1:38:17] miracle to be alive from the medicine
[1:38:19] alone
[1:38:21] i went to get scammed the other day and
[1:38:24] the and the and the person came out to
[1:38:26] scan me she was about my age and
[1:38:29] and and i thought she was a christian
[1:38:31] because the way she wore her hair and i
[1:38:32] i talked to her a bit i i never did
[1:38:34] gather that but i i talked to her a bit
[1:38:37] and she said you know i looked over your
[1:38:39] case i looked all the way back to the
[1:38:41] beginning and she said in my mind's eye
[1:38:45] i thought i was going to walk out to a
[1:38:47] man in a wheelchair
[1:38:49] you're a picture of health
[1:39:02] and i just simply said
[1:39:04] that's my god
[1:39:07] [Applause]
[1:39:22] but cancer is not the only front that
[1:39:23] you have to face
[1:39:26] many of you fight
[1:39:28] fronts on your job
[1:39:34] there's no job perfect
[1:39:36] can i give you a news bulletin there's
[1:39:38] no job perfect
[1:39:42] no job perfect
[1:39:44] young people when you go get a job
[1:39:46] let me just remind you when you go get a
[1:39:48] job the only reason that that that
[1:39:50] you're you're there is they need you
[1:39:54] [Applause]
[1:39:55] if they could have did it themselves
[1:39:57] they would have did it themselves and
[1:39:59] saved themself a ton of money but they
[1:40:01] need you to do the best that you can do
[1:40:04] and be the best representative that you
[1:40:06] can be
[1:40:07] so quit hating your job
[1:40:11] and do it to the best of your ability
[1:40:13] somebody ought to be standing on their
[1:40:15] feet right now

[1:40:43] if there's anything that i just distaste
[1:40:46] and i'm sorry i'm still preaching
[1:40:49] if there's anything that i distaste
[1:40:52] is somebody to walk to my table
[1:40:54] and tell me how bad they hate what
[1:40:56] they're doing
[1:40:59] i'm looking around can we get somebody
[1:41:01] else to wait on me
[1:41:07] or to walk up to the counter at
[1:41:08] mcdonald's and

[1:41:12] it's as though they're they're there
[1:41:14] with their their their little little and
[1:41:16] they're just they're in another world
