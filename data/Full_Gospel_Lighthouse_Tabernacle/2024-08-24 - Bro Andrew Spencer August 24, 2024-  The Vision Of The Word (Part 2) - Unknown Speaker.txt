times here due to our limited time there at the school um at nighttime so want to remember those things uh we got brother Donnie Reagan speaking for us this year brother Tim puit and brother Timothy puit so we want to pray for them and the address for those meetings it is at mon videoo middle school that is 7648 mcagis Ville Road penl Virginia 22846 and I believe that's on our church Facebook page and then if you would have any questions on directions or how to get there just ask one of the members here uh we'll have some youth events and different things going on so just be remembering those things but remember this is a school it's not a church but we're going to have church there amen so it is a public school so rules do apply at those School schs and uh and public buildings so just be mindful of those things don't let your children be wandering uh there will be uh limits to the building uh parking will be assisted with our brothers and those uh have been made mention to who we will be using for those if not brother Alton will be speaking with you on that um but we will have parking and give direction on that uh so just make sure that with your children at all times go to the restroom with them um don't be letting them run up and down the hallways and uh just be mindful of that we'd like to leave the back rows more for the families with smaller children and or anyone that would have health issues as far as those things go we'd like for you to come in slide into the centers fill up the rows move forward don't just fill up the very back we're going to limit those until the building is full so uh don't just fill up the back as far as that goes the ows and front and back are carpeted but within the seating it is tiled so just be mindful of that and the reason why I say this is metal water bottles so if you have a metal water bottle and uh I don't mind you bringing one but you don't need a two L at church if you're dehydrated that much let's let's go ahead and take care of that before we get here amen and uh there is a water fountain at the church but if you would happen to have a water metal water bottle and it rolls stings ding ding ding ding ding ding all the way to the front brother Gabe just got himself a new water bottle cuz it ain't coming back amen so just be mindful of those little things amen so I know this is a school but we're going to make it the house of God for that weekend amen so come in be prepared for service don't arrive 10 minutes late thinking you're going to get a perfect seat amen you're going to get what our deacons and our ushers will allow you to have at that time amen there will be a nursery provided for um mothers there that are nursing so just be mindful of that if you can arrive early pray read your

lot of friends that are coming in and we want to talk to them we'll make arrangements for that Sunday evening we're going to have a meal at Spotswood High School so it won't be at the middle school it will be at the high school so just be mindful of that I think if you've signed up for anything just make sure you bring those things and hey it's going to be a great time in the Lord amen if you see something that needs to be done or someone that needs some help or assistance just ask one of our deacons or just make us aware of it and we will try to be as accommodating as possible amen amen well

gathered here in a place that is called the house of God and Lord we fully submit ourselves into the hands of almighty God lord we recognize that every demon power is is against the Church of the Living God for moving into the presence of the shikina but I believe with all of my heart that thou has showed up into this meeting here tonight to bring Sons and Daughters of God to their full position and to bring the captives back and break every bondage of every Power of hell that will keep them from seeing who they truly are in the word of this hour so father we devote our attention to your word we realize Lord that Satan has come against us we realize that Satan is upset but we realize that if God is on our side it doesn't matter what what comes it doesn't matter what goes we realize that we have a god that is amongst us you're God on the mountain and you're God in the valley and we express through our mortal lips right now there's no God like my God I don't know you like the rest of the world knows you as a God that disappoints but I know you as a God that never fails you have kept me safely this far you'll take me the rest of the way home and I pray tonight as we just begin to entertain the presence of the Lord Lord that you'd feel welcome here at Full Gospel Lighthouse Lord we've come here for a meeting tonight and Lord we're asking for a supernatural meeting one like Abraham had with Elohim I pray that that Mighty Angel would step into this room just now I feel the presence of the Lord here at the pull pit and I know that you've come to bless your children so father we just move ourselves aside just for a moment and ask for the presence of God to have full Liberty in this place so Satan we just want to tell you go on get out of here go on get out of here this is a house of God and we submit ourselves to Jesus Christ for the glory of God's sake we pray this in the most holy name that there is the name of Jesus Christ and the church said and the bride said amen may God richly bless you if you have your Bibles this evening we'd like to look over in a few portions of scripture in the book of Exodus chapter 3 and Hebrews chap 11 you could just find those those spots there for us this this evening we' like to draw your attention to the word we realize that no service is complete without the reading of the word amen amen Exodus chapter 3 I I don't want you to get Disturbed tonight by by the sound system I don't want you get disturbed by the brothers working here tonight I I I give them full Liberty to work this entire audience as they need to but I want you to I want you to be very attentive I believe that you're not just you're not just ordinary churchgoers you're the kind of people that you can press through the the distractions and you can find what God has for you amen amen I'd like to I'd like to just draw our attention uh one more time uh on this thought that that we spoke a little bit on last weekend on the vision the vision of the word and I'd like to just just maybe dive into these things by the help of the Lord here this evening in Exodus chapter 3 it says now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law the priest of Midian and he led the flock to the backside of the desert and he came to the Mountain of God even to herb and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the Bush was not consumed and Moses said I will now turn aside and see this great sight and I want you to draw your attention to that word that word I will now turn aside and see this great sight if you look that word up in the Hebrew it means Vision it means the sight of the phenomena it's a spectacular appearance it is a supernatural event it is the power of seeing that Moses said I will now turn aside and see this great Supernatural sight while the bush is not burnt and when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see God God called unto him out of the midst of the Bush and said Moses Moses and he said here am I and he said drawn now hither put off thy shoes from off thy feet for the place whereon thou standest is Holy Ground moreover he said I am the god of the Father the god of Abraham the god of Isaac and the god of Jacob and Moses hid his face for he was afraid to look upon God when you look in that that scripture verse six right there it's enough to shout the whole service down to be honest with you that the god that Abraham was talking to and the god of that Isaac was talking to is the god that was talking to Moses now Hebrews 11: 24 says it like this by faith Moses we' say it like this by Revelation Moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer Affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a SE a season esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasure in Egypt for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward by faith he forsook Egypt not fearing the Wrath of the king for he endured as seeing him who is invisible may God bless his word you may be seated here in the presence of the Lord as we said we like to speak to you on the vision the vision of the word if you look here in this in this scripture reading in verse 27 of Hebrews that by faith he forsook Egypt not fearing the Wrath of the king for he endured as seeing him as seeing him who is invisible and you look at that word in the Greek it is horo which means to see it means to behold it means to perceive it means to see with the eyes or to see with the mind I love this I love this translation it means to become acquainted with by an experience it means to EXP experience to look on and I love what what the writers say here that he said no this word gives prominence to the Discerning mind when the physical side recedes this word denotes perception this word denotes perception and looking that Paul by or by by Moses by Revelation he was able to forsake the things that he know not fearing the wrath of Satan but he was able to be able to pierce into another Realm by looking through the eyesight of not by his natural eyesight but he was able to pierce through it by the perception of Revelation because he had an experience that he recognized that he wasn't alone up there on that mountain it wasn't something that happened in his mind but it was an actual experience and I know that that word sometimes it it scares people but Moses had an experience with almighty God right there on top of that mountain it it influenced his life in such a way that that it pressed him to be able to go against everything that he ever knew and everything that he had been raised up and everything that he consciously knew in his mind he was able to thwart by the power of that Revelation now the prophet said here in a hidden life he said we've held this ground for so long he said I believe with all of my heart that we're on the threshold of stepping into another Veil Yonder somewhere to where the great mysteries of God will be made known to the church he said and for me I've got both ears and both he said I got both ears and eyes and heart open to the hear the message when it comes to examine it he said for Satan will put out many a false Runner but just lay it aside remember it's only signifying that something real is going to take place when you see it he said for Satan will do everything to blockade the real Jewel of God when it's coming forth you'll hear it you he'll put a blockade to catch Abel he put a blockade to catch Abel he put one out to cat Joseph he put one out to catch Jesus and so forth he put one out to get Moses for you can notice that those things that Satan will try to block it well you say well what are you saying there brother Andrew I'm saying just exactly like William brandham said it that when Satan comes to block it you've got to open your eyes and your ears and heart to hear the message when it comes to examine the message because when Satan comes to block the message that's the only thing to do is to open your ears and your eyes and your heart to be able to understand what the message is doing now I I I I find it amazing that this week that I the Lord had dealt with me on this thought a couple weeks or a week and a half ago on the vision of the word and I find it amazing this opening up the first part of the week I had something that had never happened to me I completely went completely almost blind in my right eye I was looking through a looking through a fog and I was I couldn't see I thought I had something in my eye I thought it was my contact or I so I flushed it out and it still didn't get no better and actually went to the eye doctor cuz I thought well I need to make sure something ain't wrong here it was like I was constantly looking through a fog it wouldn't go away it wouldn't go away and so I went to the doctor and by the time that you know how you know how your body does by the time you get to the doctor you're almost better and so and so I I go there and I'm starting to see more clearly as I go as I'm going and a doctor does all these kinds of tests and he's looking at my eye and checking everything and does all of his doing doing all of his instruments and checking everything but he he but he begins to tell me he said now he said what you have experienced is what they call a retinal migraine or an an optical migrain that people actually experience a a com a blindness sometimes and if you look it up online it's pretty it's pretty amazing you be able to look through my eyes just like I don't even know how they got that picture through somebody eyes but that's pretty amazing but anyways they it's literally like looking through a fog like a rainbows completely all around it and you're almost blind and and the doctor be to explain and he started preaching to me he started preaching he said what it is he said it's he said what happens he said when you have an optimal migraine or an optical migraine he said what it is he said you got two blood vessels that are running to your eyes that are on the back of your neck he said what happens when you have that kind of migraine he said it's a blood vessel back there that's beginning to get blocked that that you can't see out of that ey out of that eye but as as you maybe you got dehydrated or maybe you didn't eat enough for this that or the other he said it could have CA could been caused by something else he said but when that blood begins to flow flow freely you'll be able to see freely again and I sitting there and I heard that man preaching to me and here he here he had one of them DDS and phds to be able to preach to me and I was sitting there Gathering sermons on the vision of the word and I thought that's exactly how Satan does he tries to block up the blood of Jesus Christ in our life to keep us from seeing what the word wants us to see but if we can ever get to a spot where maybe we got to a spot of dehydration or we wasn't eaten the message just right if we can ever get it back to a spot where the blood can flow again then you can start seeing clearly again I say I say this unto you that if you've ever went to a spot where you can't see the message and its true Vision go back to where the blood is go back to where the blood is I I just I just come into my mind just now you remember when brother Wayne Lawson was here he he dropped it one time he said I was he said I was out running he said I was out running he said I was running down through air and he said I got to a spot the sweat got in my eye and he said I I started to wipe the sweat he said but all of a sudden he said I think it's how I said it he said all of a sudden he said it begun to come to my mind he said about Jesus on the cross he said there he said I was able to rub the sweat out of my eyes but Jesus on the cross had his nails had his hands nailed up there to that cross so that so that he couldn't rub the eye he couldn't rub his eyes when the blood was dropping down over top of his eye because the crown of the Thorns that was on his head and the blood blood was Dripping over his eyes and when the people were out there and they were screaming and mocking him brother Wayne said it like this he said he didn't see them through his natural eye but he saw them through the blood oh if we can ever see what God wants us to see through the blood of Jesus Christ I say it's what Satan wants to keep us from it's because the blood has got the power to make you look clean act clean dress clean that's why Satan is wanting to hinder the Church of the Living God from the Life Source the power the supernatural event of the blood now Jesus was speaking to his disciples he begins to teach them and he begins to take them through Matthew 13 and he begins to preach to them about the soore and the seed he begins to teach them and they begin to ask him some questions said why do you speak to the people in Parables and Jesus said it like this he said it's given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of of God but to them it's not given and he went on to say but blessed are your eyes for you see and your ears for they hear he said many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which you see and have not seen them and hear those things which you hear and have not heard them to say that you're a blessed people tonight is an understatement to be able to see what you see hear what you hear understand what you understand you see he spoke to them in Parables of something that was comparison that was close in line with it but they didn't understand what he was saying about it I think it's amazing that you can look through the Through The Eyes of the word and you can see what Jesus is wanting you to see you know it's like a it's like a key it's like a key to a door you can have that key to your home you get that key both unlocks and it locks you can do it in both purposes and brother random would say it like this he said it's too long that the church has forgot that vision of what it is to unlock and to lock back up he said what it is he said they have forgot the power to bind and they forgot the power to loose but I find it amazing when the prophet I'm not going to go completely through it but when the prophet starts talking about the vision of the Silver Tip grizzly bear he's already killed the 42inch caribou and he's walking there with Bud Southwick and Bud says it's about time that that that silver CP grizzly bear shows up ain't it brother Bram he said bud I believe you're doubting that I believe you're doubting that he said and all of a sudden he said Bud said brother brandham so help me there's a great big Silver Tip standing right there and the prophet said this he said you see the key of it is the vision of the word of the Lord he said there's nothing can change it or nothing can stop it he said that's what the church needs today it's not an education what the church needs is not a denomination what the church need is not is not a Creed what the church needs is the key to the scriptures the door which Christ is a door and he is a word and faith in the word of God unlocks every door faith in God's word unlocks every door to give us the key you see the key to open up this door of revelation of this hour is the message it's a message of this hour and if you're struggling with the things of this world the message unlocks the do to it I don't care if you're dealing with depression I don't care if you're dealing with sickness I don't care what you're dealing with in this layot of and age the message unlocks the door to give you overcoming power Hallelujah I believe that as human beings that we realize as humans that we are influenced by what we see I think it's very hard for us not to be influenced by what we see it it's kind of like like a man that's constantly watching his he constantly watching his bank account and it's constantly draining down it's constantly going down it begins to dwindle out and begins to he begins to look at that financial statement he begins to look in there and he begins to get influenced by what he sees and all of a sudden a real man of God he he he gets influenced by what he sees and he said well I better not pay my ti because I'm going to run myself short but a man that is influenced by the word of God says whether whether I can't make it or not God's my partner in this you see in contrast that's what faith does it makes him look not at the circumstances not in his problems not in his situation you could choose a million things right there you could take a man that's sick and if he keeps constantly looking at his sickness instead of looking at the word of God he's influenced by what he sees but the Christian is not influenced in this worm of mortality he is influenced in the realm of the heavens but I think it's amazing how quickly you change your tune by according to what you see because you can be in defeat you can be in despair you can be without hope but all of a sudden you let somebody catch you a vision and show you that there's a God that's on your side it quickly changes your tune now we got scripture to back up what we're talking about just like when Gaza is standing up there with Elijah and he saw the circumstance in front of him and he got worried and he said a last m how shall we do this Syrian our army is coming up here to attack us but I love what the prophet did he changed his vision to match what the word already said was there in one place William brandham said that Elijah didn't even see them Angels up there he said but he knew because Psalms 34 said that the angels of the Lord would be encamped about him the prophet knew that he would be there Hallelujah so I say this to you it doesn't matter whether you see them here tonight or not it doesn't matter whether you feel them here tonight or not there are angels that are encamped about the Church of the Living God no matter what your situation is realize there's a promise that is bigger than your situation no matter what you're looking at the prophet would preach a very powerful message I'm going to lay some things in here and we're going to preach but the but the prophet would preach a message on look he said when you hear the word it usually somebody trying to get you to see what they're looking at they say to you look and he says they're trying to get you to look at the scene whether it's a mountain or or a cactus or this that or the other he said but they're trying to get your attention to look at what they're saying and the prophet said now everybody's looking today everybody's looking for something everybody's looking for something to happen he said we know the world is constantly watching the skies the radar and the screens that we have we have up around the world Every Nation for its own defense has got a Magic Eye like looking to find something to appear to this screen like an atomic missile or something they've got something there to go back to the one that sent it that way he said but everything is a looking the Ford companies's looking to make a better for the Chevrolet is looking to make a better Chevrolet he said Phoenix is making looking to make a bigger and larger town he said but the nation is looking for more territory so that it can spread itself he said the church is looking for more more members but the bride is looking for the coming of her Lord we're all looking he said but it depends on what the voice is trying to tell you to look for so it depends if I tell you to look for an apple up here you're not going to find it but if I tell you to look for the word by your eyesight not your natural eye but the spiritual heart it'll make you look past what you see it'll make you think that's what you think it's like Moses when he was up there he didn't realize what he was doing Sister Sarah but he was literally walking into a vision he didn't realize what he was doing up there he thought he was just up up there just being a Shepherd again on another on that same Mountain that he'd been up there before but he was walking into a vision i' say that sometimes we walk into church and don't realize that were walking right in step with the music he said but one day he said when he was up there on the back side of the desert what he lacked the burning bush had and he said Moses saw a vision of the word that was God and when he did the vision spoke the word and he said I remember my promise that was all Moses needed right there said I remember my promise that I made to Abraham Isaac and Jacob and Moses saw the vision of it it's amazing when you begin to look at the scriptures and look at the parallels of the the time that the first Exodus started by a prophet meeting the pillar of fire and the Third Exodus starts by the prophet meeting that same Angel of the Covenant we could say it like this that Moses was fellowshipping with Elohim to think that when Moses is standing there and he's having a conversation with the god of Abraham the god of Isaac he's having a conversation he's talking with him and Moses begins to write the first five books of the Bible he begins to go all the way back there in the Garden of Eden and he's sitting down there and he sees Adam by Vision he sees Eve my vision he sees creation my vision why he was having a supernatural charge a an experience with the word of God and the word of God was taking him through the word and teaching him what it was to say how it was to be sa whether it was good that Moses was writing or whether it was bad that Moses was writing Moses was writing by Vision now think about it it's been 400 years that they've been in that they've been there in Egypt to think how much time that had been from Moses all the way to Abraham and from Abraham all the way to Adam but to think that Enoch was there fellowshipping with Adam and the Garden of Eden and Moses picks that up by the word he picks it up by the word and he starts teaching he starts laying things in because somebody is talking to him he's not looking at what he sees he's not looking at what he feels he's not looking at what Moses sees he's looking through the scope of the word I hope you hear me preaching to you tonight but the vision has got a voice the vision's got a voice and the prophet said it like this he said when the vision speaks he said there's nothing that can ever turn it around he said it's always perfect it's always perfect he said and in praying for the sick tonight as we pray for the sick the Lord may come to us and give us visions and if he does remember the vision does not heal the people the vision is only a Vindication that the word is Right Hallelujah a vision doesn't heal you a vision only tells you that the word is right just like a prophet is a prophet is a Divine Seer by the almighty God he begins to look at things and he fortells things that are to come and the prophet would sit there and he would show signs and it would do wonders which is a Vindication that that man had the perfect interpretation of the word of God just like when Paul was up there on the road to Damascus and is writing down there with letters in his carment to carry out and to kill every Christian that he ever comes up against but remember that he meets the same light that Moses meets he has an experience with the same God that Moses had met and he's standing right there and he knocks him off of his high horse and he hears a voice and he sees a man now there's other people the Bible said they heard the voice but they didn't see no man what was it that vision made Paul go blind and the word of the Lord came to ananas and said unto him there's a man that's going down there that's laying there that's laying there here's God dealing with a man that's a preacher that has visions and he shows him a vision there's one sa of Tarsus he's had an experience with me go lay your hands on him that he could receive his sight but not only do that lay your hands on him so that he can receive reive the baptism of the Holy Ghost what was it ananas was looking at the same vision that Paul was looking at but he was looking at it through the word of the moment now notice what the prophet said he said now the way he says this in the testimony of raising a dead boy he said now the way that I base friends I base friends on this as faith I probably feel that I might be an amateur in that brother if brother manam was an amateur what are we he said but where my faith is based concerning the gift that was given me he said it's by some people receive it by Revelation some people pick it up out of the word some people take it by inspiration he said but mine is Vision when I see those Vision happen he said there's nothing in the world that can change it so the prophet is a prophet a Divine seer of the word and you know Hallelujah by the word that he speaks you can recognize that he is a Divine interpreter of the word just like Paul he went over there in Egypt and studied the word of God for three and a half years and he come back preaching Jesus stronger than anybody else because God was going to take a message down to a gentile people just like William brandham stood there and was a Divine interpreter of the word that he was able to look by the scope of the word and pull out Revelations where did them Revelations come from they didn't come from this world They Came From Another Dimension hallelujah how did he say he said my my lays in Vision my my gift doesn't lay interpretation my gift doesn't lay in Inspiration my gift doesn't deal than that my gift lays in the word by vision and nothing can change it now let me let me just capture your attention for a job had every disappointment he had every right to look at the scene he had everything taken from him he had his crops burned he had his children taken from him he had every bit of livestock taken away from him but job said that though God slay me I'm going to trust him now some of you go through stuff and you've been through stuff for your whole entire life and you say well I'm just going to come to the end of it and I'm gonna give up job went through everything that you read in 42 chapters he went through it in one year but job did not allow the situations that he seen to affect the vision of the supernatural because job is standing there in that situation and he catches a re ation and said in my flesh he said I know that my redeemer liveth and in my flesh I shall see God now you got to think about this job is not looking at the word job's not looking at that in word form because job is the very first book that's ever written but job is catching that by Revelation that he's looking at a vision and he sees himself on the other side side of Calvary and he sees himself standing with Jesus Hallelujah he didn't say we're not just people that stand up here and quote Isaiah 53 and just go on M just shooting things off of our mouth just to say believe the promise believe the promise believe the promise one of these days that promise has got to become a vision to you come on somebody it became a living reality to job job sealed his Covenant he sealed his life on that that in my flesh even though the skin worms toore my body in my flesh hallelujah we're not just a bunch of people that stand up here and quote scripture we're not just a bunch of people that quote quotes come on somebody there's a living reality behind the word there's a vision what I'm saying to you is when you can look past the things that you see don't just see it as a promise but see it as a possession it's mine that's for me and my house it's mine it's my belonging it's my possession it's my inheritance it's my [Applause] vision because there's a lot of people that quote the word there's a lot of church goers that quote the word there's a lot of message Believers that go to church and quote the message but what gives Satan real trouble is when you see it as reality Lord help me and I know it's pretty amazing that we live in the AG the age of the eagle that the prophet gives us prophetic Vision to be able to look at Visions as they break over people's lives that he could tell you prolific details in their life he could tell you their address he could tell you where they came from he could tell you why they had this Gorder he could tell you the certain things that were in their life he could get it down to a perfect word there's a lot of gifts there was a lot of Ministries that would stand there and say you've got this going on and a lot of times because of the supernatural element that would be a releas so and people would get free under that but this what you are under is more than just a prophet's Ministry this is more than a Prophet come on somebody but this is a prophet messenger he didn't just come here to tell us our address he didn't just come here to give us healing he didn't just come here to show us that Visions were still in the church he didn't just come here to give us Deliverance he come us to put us in the same form that Jesus was in that we can operate with the word in our bodies the word in our mouth the word in our mind the word in our soul and he's standing there and you realize he said now what is it that makes a vision break over somebody he said science can't explain it he said we don't even realize the atoms that are let loose when a vision breaks because it's a reality he said we don't realize the atoms that are breaking when a vision Breaks Loose he said but I know this that a vision is to give the children understanding I love how the prophet said it like this he said when Jesus was standing there and he's feeding the 5,000 he said what atoms did he use what things did he cut loose in the Supernatural that he could take he could take fresh fish and make it cook fish he said what Adams did he take and set loose so that he could feed the 5,000 it wasn't in a vision it was a reality because you know you can't E A Vision you can't E A Vision but it's got to be a reality so if it's that way in squirrels what has it got to be I don't want to just be William Brandon's Vision I want to be the reality of what a prophet saw I want to be the vision of the word [Applause] for the Bible said that we walk by faith and not by sight so if we're constantly relying on the things that we see we are never going to walk by faith if we're constantly looking at the things that we see if we're always looking at the Downy deers if we're always looking at the Debbie downers if we're always looking at the ISM if we're always looking at what this one says or that one says then we're never going to walk by faith if we're always looking at what Satan says instead of what God says then we're never going to walk by faith but if we walk by faith it doesn't matter what we see let cancer rage let tumors rage let cancer let it do all of its worst but as for me I got my vision on a word that's never failed [Applause] I'm not relying on what I see I'm not relying on what I feel I'm not relying on what I go through I'm relying on the word the Bible said in Hebrews 1 that God who had Sun Times in diverse manner spake in times past un the fathers by the prophets the prophet said in God identified in his characteristics he said 'th prophets their Visions Vindicated was God's characteristic made known by The Prophet's Vision he said no man can explain a vision he said there's no way of doing it it's supernatural he said it's something that you see what has been what is and what will be and that was God's way of sending a man that spoke those things and showed those things that would come to pass later on in in that message he would say but now before you can believe the word of that age he identifies himself in the characteristics see by knowledge by Vision he identifies himself in the characteristics by Vision he told those things that would happen and it happens and God said when that happens then you believe he has the interpretation of the word because the word of the Lord comes to this man and then Moses is standing there he's just a Shepherd he's 40 years on the back side of a desert running from his calling but he's got something powerful in his hand that God is going to use and You' been through some stuff and the things that God has put in your life God is going to use that to whip the devil to open up the Red Sea to swallow up serpents to make water turn into blood he's going to take the elements of the natural and put it in the Supernatural and release the spiritual to the situation I want to say this to you while the anointing of God is here you're already free if I can say it to you you're free you're free free at last free indeed come on I ain't waiting till Labor Day meetings I'm not waiting till next week I'm free right now I'm Healed right now I'm delivered right now why not the Supernatural is here the presence of God is here the angels are here but the redeemed of the Lord is here somebody give God praise Hallelujah Satan can come fear can come anxiety can come but I got a vision I got Clarity what he telling me he said take the natural things and throw the natural things down and watch them swallow up come on somebody why don't you take your problems and throw them down but when you take it up this time don't take it up like you threw it down take it up in the name of Jesus come on somebody you might see a snake laying there but on the other side of it I see a judgment Rod there there you might see failures you you might see mistakes you might see troubles but pick it up in the name of Jesus and watch it for destroy pharaoh and his [Applause] army mother brand said it like this he said he was given him a Vindication when he told him to throw it down and it turned into a serpent and picked it up he when he God gives an absolute he gives a Vindication to that absolute Hallelujah Moses was a man like you but Moses had an experience much like you've had an experience and Moses is standing there and no matter what he faced impersonators could come mockers could come unbelievers could come Skeptics could come Pharaoh could come but he had a voice that give him a vision that he was coming back to this same Mountain where he had an experience and he's telling him on this mountain on this mountain you're going to come back here and you're going to worship me you're talking about a power behind that Vision when Pharaoh wouldn't let let him go the first time he held on to that Vision he held on to the power of it when it didn't look like it was going to let him go and he took up dust and he created fleas he took up dust and he created frogs he held on to that Vision he held on to that Vision no matter what his sister was saying no matter what his brother was saying and it might have seemed ridiculous to everybody else but Moses had in his hand more than a Crooked Stick but he had a vision when Pharaoh all they had was Spears Moses had the name of Jesus Christ you see that was all that he needed was the word that's all you need today it's not a credential from some church you don't need a denomination to back you up you need the word to take the Rapture with you don't need some credential you don't need some long history of some school to be healed this morning you need to accept the word that does it that's all we need that stick in the hand of Moses was like in the name of Jesus Christ in every single one of your hands I would say it like this that's all you ever need that's all you're ever going to need you don't need some school you don't need some book you don't need some theology you don't need some intellectual conception the name of Jesus Christ in your hand let me say it like this Moses Mo Moses was a vessel that stick couldn't talk but the one that was carrying it could come on somebody that stick could do a lot of things but that stick was powerless unless it was in the hands of Moses the name of Jesus is powerful now the Visions got a voice the vision's got to speak that most Moses could speak let me say it let me put it in this form for you that green checkered shirt couldn't talk that green checkered shirt couldn't talk that measuring tape couldn't talk come on somebody but the man that was Greg wearing that Green checkered shirt had a voice and the prophet knew that that man was going to carry this message preach this message the green checkered shirt can't talk but I say this to you by the word of the Lord you can come on somebody you can ED brother Ed bisc preached he spoke he testified of what the vision said but now it's your turn I'm charging you it's your turn if brother Ron Falls by the wayside if brother Ron goes by the grave if brother Andrew Falls by the wayside if brother Andrew Falls and falls and he and he and he goes by the grave it's your turn what what are you going to do with the name of Jesus what are you going to do with this message the vision has a voice behind it and I will not be silenced I will not be quiet I will not set up I will not be quiet you can't tell me to go sit down in my Pew I had a vision talk to me the vision said I was worthy the vision said I was redeemed the vision said I was bought the vision said I was the vision the vision of the word is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever Moses endured I seeing him who is invisible the prophet said it like this that Moses and Pharaoh was looking out the same window they was looking at the same scene they was looking at the same situation and Pharaoh a bunch of slaves but Moses was looking at the redeemed of the Lord Moses was looking at a people that was getting ready the prophet estimated two million people was living down there and 2 million people was getting ready to make the greatest exit out of any country that ever had been you talking about open borders Moses had a Ministry to open every border and let his children walk over on dry ground the prophet said like this that Moses Moses could have delivered them by his political power he said but that's not the car characteristics of God he said because the characteristics of God are Supernatural so we had to work through his identification of his characteristics so if God would have delivered him by political power because fa Moses had his foot on the throne he could have done it but that wasn't God's provided way but God had another way that he was going to bring them out you said what was that way brother Andrew it was a mighty hand you see God's characteristics is always Supernatural every time you see the handiwork of the Lord you see the supernatural in every single one of our Lives whether you can believe it oright or not there's a vision that is breaking over your life that'll let you know that where you're going it'll tell you where you're going you remember when the prophet he had preached in his early Ministry and he told it for two years that God was going to raise up a little dead boy now when brother bam when brother bham was standing there 1950 he's on the other side of it but he begins to relate he said now you know that you all had that all across this nation he said you had that in the fly leaf of your Bible for two years that God was going to raise up a little boy he laid out the panoramic of how everything was going to look at and how everything was going to be and when brother Brandon is coming back on the other side of Canada brother brandham said these words he said these words he said it'll be a master Vision that'll stir everything he said there's one Vision that's still got to come he said it's a master Vision that'll stir everything H up now you notice this that little boy didn't realize when he was riding his bicycle that day what he was going to go through but there was a man for two years before that that had been telling this that it was going to be thus and thus Finley didn't recognize what the angel of the Lord was doing I'd say then parents didn't even realize brother Ron that a prophet was on the scene that if a prophet didn't have that vision and if a prophet didn't say what he said that little boy would have still been dead today but because there was a prophet that had a vision of that little boy couldn't stay there dead he spoke he said you can line up every single devil in hell and he couldn't stop that vision from coming to pass now I'm just looking at it through my eyes on the other side of the message if that was a master vision and it stirred up everything what about Sir what is is this a sign of the end time and a prophet is standing there and he says I see a great blast it could be my destruction he said but it could be the releasing of those Seven Seals now if that Vision stirred up all of Finland stirred up all of Europe what about this church what about this Vision hell can't handle the reality that the seals have been ripped off of it I can preach with this microphone I can preach with these speak ERS I can preach with this I can preach with these mons I can preach without you I preached it in covid when nobody was sitting here but you are what the Seven Seals spoke of you are to be stirred up you don't need some emotional time to stir you up the message come on some I don't need no organ to pump me up I don't need no I don't need no piano to pump me up I don't need no stop I don't need no guitar I don't need no bass I don't need no microphone I'm stirred up this message is everything this message has stirred up more than hell it stirred up all of heaven heaven is here in this [Applause] room I feel a fire like Jeremiah and it's shut up in my bones and I can't be quiet I'm stirred up by Seven Seals being revealed I'm stirred up by a prophet's message stir me up brother Andrew if I got to stir you up it's a sign that you're dead but if this message if this message if this message if this message you going to catch it one of these days if this message has stirred you up come on somebody forget the chills forget the emotions forget the dance forget the shout forget all of it if I got this message I got [Applause] everything come on somebody all I need is two in this place that's all I need that's all need because Jesus said where are two or three are gathered in my name there I be in the midst of them I'm one of them I'm one of them where's number two at come on where's number two at where's number three at well we got more than two or three here we got a Powerhouse here that's stirred up stirred up by the releasing of what hell was trying to stop a couple weeks I'm going preach to you I'm going preach to you about your experience of what it's like to be loosed maybe I'll give a little interlude right here what it's like to be Loos waiting on the day waiting on the opportunity you got the date set the judge got it set the family's waiting on the outside let me give a little Prelude here but when he hears the voice said it's time for your day to walk out because a jubilee trumpet sounded you ain't got to go back to that prison sale you ain't got to go back to them bars you ain't got to back go back to that situation because a Word a judge said it's over so let me say it through the voice of the message the case is dismissed the case is dismissed what are you saying brother Andrew I don't
