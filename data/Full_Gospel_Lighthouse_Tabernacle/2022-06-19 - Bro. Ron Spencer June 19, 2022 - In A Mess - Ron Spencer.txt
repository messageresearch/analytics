a great joy if you get to experience it as a grandfather it's even a greater joy i can't imagine what great great grandfather would be like but uh amen just we're so thankful that what god has allowed us to be and we just are we're just really thrilled about what god is doing for us in this moments of our time we had a wonderful week and we was able to share some time with some of you as believers that brother jeremy had arranged and i was able to get on a merry-go-round with i don't know maybe 40 or 50 of you guys and i thought you know i don't know but i this just gives me a touch of heaven amen and i was i was sitting beside of charlie and noah was somewhere there and uh sitting beside it charlie and brother jim was holding him in and i thought you know we're a long way from the vision now and he's growing up and you know and enjoying life and so we're just so thankful for what god has done sister sister joyce it's just an honor to have you here this weekend and i i we we have prayed for you we love you here as a body of believers sister joyce lost her son to cancer i was able john god just gave me a moment literally a moment to be able to go meet him and pray with him and touch him we went to his funeral the other day on saturday and i'm sorry i had to slip away i had to go take a treatment and uh and so we uh didn't get to eat with you but we sure love you with all of our hearts i'm sure the chicken was good and uh you could send word back that brent brent did an awesome job on that that funeral as well spoke a lot of wonderful things about your son and and uh thank god there's a land beyond the river amen so glad to have sister nancy back with us this morning she was sick yesterday and and she feeling better today and i saw her as she was rejoicing over there those arms waving like an eagle's wings and i thought you know one day we're going to have a great land beyond the river and we'll all be young be about the same age and won't that be a time and so amen amen next week i will be at brother josh bennett's and that'll be my first time to preach in their meeting and brother josh invited me to be there i'll be speaking on saturday night and brother wayne lawson and brother jonathan martin will be speaking in that meeting and i expect you to be here so you you pray for me you pray for me there and i expect you here so amen i'm sure they'll have some sort of a way that you can watch that at a later time two weeks from now brother wayne lawson will be here and uh and that'll be the weekend after that and uh i there's going to be a wonderful dinner that has been being prepared by her by our sisters as brothers father's day it's not just today it's every day but i'm thank god these women can put things together in about five minutes like us men will take days and days and days and and so you know it's a truth and so amen so thank you thank you for that brother wayne will be bringing a spiritual feast and and we'll be having dinner together as well amen amen brother andrew will be speaking for us next weekend saturday and sunday night and so i just want to say something for our newer ones that are among us here brother rogers so good to have you again two sundays in a row we're we're getting we're going to change bodies here so you just hang with us and i want to say something for the for the public as far as as far as even on the internet you know in churches we're getting to the spot when we're starting to have our 50th anniversary ministries begin to get older and brother joe was here last night and they had to transition a couple of times brother henry greene was the founder of the church then brother dan daisley who was the associate pastor for all of those years since the very beginning of time then brother joe came along and it's not just succession to worry that you pick a man and he goes because that's the way the nominationals do it and so god has to raise up a man god god raises up a man we can we can see god raise up men and too many times that is squashed but when god raises up a man god uses that man maybe to help that local assembly and uh just andrew so happens to be our our our associate pastor and now our pastor with us and and we're we're we're kind of a strange sordid team here and i want to explain that just a little bit for the newer ones that are here when we started our journey this is a kind of a neat thing when we started our journey before the journey even started at communion we elected andrew as our next pastor and so that was about two years ago and so we've watched that we've watched him grow we've watched him in his maturity of the word every every service he only gets better but god did that i shouldn't didn't do it i i now i want to be a mentor to him and i want to coach him and i will coach him and i will stomp my foot at him but he has to be a student of the word and he is and i want to thank him for that but not only that the lord showed me something in a visitation here just a bit ago of of our great gathering and he showed me that before ministry would go there would be worship leaders that he had raised up raised up to worship and and showed me men and i'm just going to name them and there's a there's thousands of them but men like andrew uh timothy pruitt michael ray uh we were just with ben ben erickson men like that that have a special anointing on them to meet not just to sing songs but to lead in worship whether you know it or not worship is the key to opening the heart and it's that's where god dwells in the praises of his people he builds trees to to worship he he has animals to worship birds worship and sing it's it's a noisy kingdom with god now you're the highest specie you're his wife he's not looking for a mannequin he don't want your your just your your selfishness and your you're closing yourself up and well i'm going to let somebody else no he's wanting you he's wanting you to get beyond yourself now listen this is easy once you get the holy ghost your resistance to worship tells you you don't have it well i'm afraid i'll get i'll get beside of myself you didn't mind getting beside of yourself when you were drunk on alcohol and you were a slobbery nasty idiot come on then you you did things that were very uncharacteristic that we don't want to mention today because you were beyond yourself found yourself in the arms of another lover in times [Music] because you were under the influence of another spirit now here we're under the influence of god and god don't do anything out of order you won't have to worry about women flipping upside down and god don't do silly stuff neither is he a showboat he's a gentleman brother branham operated and taught us his ministries that that he was a gentleman he taught us pulpit manners he taught us how how to to speak he taught us different things and and he had to institute a lot of different things because there was a lot of wow wild stuff that was going on and you say well brother ron it's going to get out of hand don't you worry there's always enough wet blankets around put it out so i i i'm thrilled as i was standing over there i had these comments to make and i thought well god's allowing andrew to do what i'm getting ready to talk to him about so i say job well done amen god bless you andrew amen god bless you amen people get jealous of andrew well you're just getting jealous and you're just showing that to god and people have left this church because they were jealous of him i said good and i really mean that maybe i said something in the flesh right there but i meant it anyway so amen i so love you with all of my heart so love you that song that was saying means a whole lot to our family even when you don't see him you're working because angels sang it and brother tim heard it on the other side of the house and connie sang it at two o'clock and brother brother tim had a dream about seeing buzzards and pigs eating those buzzards amen i would like to personally thank god for two and a half years of of being able to live through this cancer and taken the treatment i'd like to thank god for that it is not for sissies i apologize that some of you had to see that this week and the difficulties and the things that go on generally i can hide a lot of things but when you're sick you're sick and when you're weak you're weak and so but thank you for your patience with me through this through this trial and uh but we're we're getting through it and so we we thank you for that sometimes the cure is worse than the the disease itself and so amen i want you to remember there's churches that are affected by covet again just be careful and if you're sick please stay home and do that for us and uh we we're certainly we're certainly thankful that god has brought us this far and so we certainly appreciate that i want to speak a sermon to you today that's very appropriate after everything that's happened i've never spoke it i've never heard it but i want to preach to you about in a mess i think every one of you are going to find yourself in the scriptures today so let's stand to our feet and if you will turn with me to genesis chapter 20 and verse 1 this afternoon thank you for allowing me to take a few moments to kind of catch my breath as well andrew did i miss any announcements there is a baptismal laughter afterwards sister jeannette is getting baptized and i'm going she asked me if i would do it and so i'm going to do it with brother andrew and if you're jealous i andrew will get that thing straight for her right now and uh i know she's not and she's known him since he was a kid so but i'm thrilled i'm thrilled you're going to find yourself here today in this sermon sister neda so i want you to pay very close attention to it david you're going to find yourself in this as well amen along with 200 and whatever people here you're going to find yourself in these scriptures i want you to remember the topic in a mess and abraham journeyed from fence towards south country and dwelled between kadesh and sher and sojourned in greer and abraham said to sarah his wife she is my sister and amelie king of greer sent and took sarah but god came to amaleech in a dream by night and said to him behold thou art but a dead man for the woman which thou has taken she is a man's wife you may be seated brother branham says this he says and god give him the land of of palestine and he told him not to leave not to leave there and any jew that leaves palestine was backslid god caught told him to stay there and if god tells you to do something another and you don't do it i bet you can predict the next words then you're a backslid if god tells you to do something and you don't do it then you're backslid is that right [Music] all right a drought came on to try abraham's faith and instead of abraham staying there no he couldn't stay there he run off and took sarah and went about 300 miles wish i had time to get on that down to another land and when he got there then he got this king down there emma leach he was a young fella hey how you doing he was a young fella and this young fella he was looking for a sweetheart so he found so he found abraham's wife sarah and fell in love with her and abraham said now you tell him that you are not you are my sister and i'm your brother so that pleased amaleech so he said all right we'll just take her over to the castle and i guess the women fixed her up and he was going to marry her the next day notice these key phrases next day and admiral h was a good man a righteous man and that night that night while he was sleeping the lord appeared to him and said you're as good as a dead man the man the woman that you have got out there to marry is another man's wife watch another man's wife why he said lord you know the integrity of my heart a righteous holy man you know the integrity of my heart that man told me that that was his sister and and didn't she tell herself that that's my brother and he said god said i know the integrity of your heart and that's the reason i've kept you from sin and against me but he's my prophet what was it he backslid a and a little lion shyster is that right oh no there ain't no little white lies they're either black lives or they're not lies at all the man is sitting there telling a point blank la telling that that was his sister when it was his wife beating around the bush backslidden and here was a righteous man standing before god and said lord you know my heart but i'll not hear your prayer ammo each take him take her back let him pray for you he's my prophet i'll hear him yeah backslider but that's my prophet that's the truth i want you to just absorb some things and now i want to kind of give you a thing brother joe read from romans 8 most of you know that's been here forever know that that's one of my favorite scriptures romans 8 and 28. i want to read it out of the passion statements this morning passion books you probably won't have that maybe you do maybe you don't in a similar way the holy spirit takes us that's verse 26 in our human frailty notice these words to empower us in our weakness in a similar way the holy spirit takes us to hold us in our human frailty to empower us in our weakness for example at times we don't even know how to pray or know the best things to ask for but the holy spirit rises up within us to us to super intercede on our behalf pleading to god with emotional size too deep for words listen i've been at that spot to where i didn't have power to pray but i just moaned in the presence of god and i could feel him on that hospital bed i could feel his presence echoing down over top of me verse 27 god the searcher of the heart knows fully our longings yet he also understands the desires of the spirit because the holy spirit passionately pleads before god for us his holy ones in perfect harmony with god's plan and our destiny verse 28 so we are convinced that every detail of our life i love this brother roger every detail of our lives is continually woven together to fit into god's perfect plan and bringing good into our lives for we are his love us who has been called to fulfill his design purpose for he knew all about us before we were born and he destined us from the beginning to share the likeness of his son this means the son is the oldest among the vast family of the brothers and sisters who will become just like him total adoption having determined our destiny ahead of time he called this to himself transformed his perfect righteousness to everyone he called and those who possess that perfect righteousness he co-glorified with his own son hallelujah hallelujah abraham had had some real experiences with god some fantastic experiences god speaks to him in genesis chapter 17. and he says abram when abram was 90 years old and nine the lord appeared to him to abram and said unto him i am the almighty god to walk before me and be thou perfect that's going to be that's going to be incredibly needful to hang on to walk before me and be thou perfect and i will make my covenant between me and thee god's a personal god and multiply thy seed exceedingly and abraham fell on his face and talked with him saying ask for me behold my covenant is with thee and doubt shall and he talked with and abraham fell on his face and god talked with him saying ask for me behold my covenant is with thee and thou shalt be a father of many nations neither shall thy name any more be called abram but thy name shall be called abraham for a father of many nations have i made thee and i will make thee exceededly fruitful and i will make nations of thee and kings shall come out of thee i want you to understand this is more than just to abraham god is having a conference with his seed with you you're thinking this is four or five thousand years ago this conference has you in his mind god is saying this to abraham because if you remember god speaks to him in a conversation and he said can you count the dust that's the granulars of the sand no man can do that that's your natural seed and he said look to the stars and we preached it look to the stars that's a type of your spiritual seed no man can count the stars and everyone is hanging in his place has a proper position has a proper name has a proper calling [Applause] you couldn't put yourself there god put you there i want you to just notice this isn't part abraham and part god god is making a covenant with him he's swearing by himself when he can swear by no greater you always swear to the grader are you with me they put their hands on the bible and swear to the to the perfect book i'll tell no lie then if they lie it goes before god not before a judge it goes before god there's a conference with him and tells him that he says that uh am the almighty he tells him over and over again in meetings everything is working towards god be coming flesh to abraham that's what this message has done we've had visitations but god wants to do more than have visitations with you he's got something for you and i wanted to speak to you god comes and he we hear brother branham talking in a sermon called is there anything too hard for the lord and they're there abraham has now confessed for for quite a while more than two decades i'm going to have a son now he's produced a son through his own energies through the bonds woman but brother branham goes back and and you'll hear brother branham sometimes brother brandon preaches a sermon and whether you know it or not he's actually preaching a vision and he's not just telling a story you hear him in the in the prayer lines he'll tell them about a yellow dog or a bus or tell him about a black car and he tell him about a doctor he's a short doctor he's kind of fat he's got real big black rim he's looking at that and so no doubt as a prophet being a seer he's looking at the vision of the word and he's watching the event as it goes on i don't think i'm adventuring without authority right here and so here is here is sarah and she's in the tent now she's begun to get older she's been harassed for years she's been barren she's been frustrated she's been intimidated god's made a promise to abraham she can't make it happen she's more than willing to make it happen but she can't make it happen and she's fussy she's stewie she's groppy brother branham says that she's hollering out the door and abraham's sitting outside he's got an atmosphere going on outside you know you want to get away from that if that's going on you want to you want to breathe you want to breathe some of you young guys it's going to happen to you too you want to get a place to where you breathe kind of detox a little bit detox you know barometric chamber you know men this is not a good time to say amen it's not a good time to laugh it's not a good time it's just not but you know what i'm talking about you can see me after church you know what i saw caravan go by the other day abraham and in that caravan they were selling hats and they were selling dresses and i saw miss locke the other day she had onto some fancy stuff them care fans don't come up here these little rags i'm wearing he's just listening uh-huh now brother branham said that satan was trying to block the visitation of god so if you feel that stewie spirit understand you're real christians and if you can remember at his trick can i just share some information when you feel that just that naughty spirit coming on you or that biting you feel that do the opposite ask god to help you in a moment he's there don't grieve him away do the opposite where there's hate or bite flip it and show love like never before brother and i need an example there's a man coming down the aisle he's crushed to preachers he's crushed a lot of men tonight he's going to crush brother branham he's going to and he begins to make his boast and as he's making his boats brother brown said this night you'll pin my feet to the floor because brother branstad i felt sorry for him and i found love for him a man was going to crush him and then he fell right to the floor these three travelers came and they came to abraham's tent i find it an incredible thing that we have a place of worship here that can host the presence of god i never want this place to ever take it for granted that he's just going to be here he must be invited and when he is invited it is when he comes wash his feet make him comfortable he's here to do business he can heal you he can save you he can feel your life he can turn you around in what you've been working on for months and years he can do it in seconds [Applause] [Music] [Applause] when god came and he sat down in front of abraham and remember abraham recognized that he was the lord to which he had been speaking to that's the reason a lot of people don't recognize the lord they ain't been talking to him and so when he came in he begins to talk and abraham has meat and milk now god has stepped into a body because he has a meeting with abraham god's got a plan and in his plan he's got a book he's got a lamb's book of life now abraham can't produce these names in this book he's done proved he's got too old his wife is too old it is impossible for him to humanly do it are you with me now let me just say this to you and i you and i cannot produce rapture with our fleshly ability it's going to take the word in action personal revelation in your life that you see yourself in the word now god has a conversation with abraham and in that conversation he reminds him about his promises he said thy seat shall possess the gates of their enemy that is a promise to which shamgar will grab a hold of naboth will hang on to david will kill his tens and tens of thousands solomon will raise up the greatest temple you will overcome demons and principalities because of the conversation that god had with abraham [Music] because you're a part of that seed lineage and you can take the word of god through your supernatural lips and begin to speak it are you with me many people sabotage their testimony with negativity and you can't have a positive life and a negative life at the same time it's kind of like being on a diet and eating a donut come on preach now [Applause] the power of life and death is in your tongue sarah had to get it for herself not just abraham's promise but it's sarah's promise [Music] god can say a lot of things about you but you got to believe it you got to believe it you ask her where's sarah why did she laugh i didn't laugh abraham tells her she's an intense door behind you to prove that to be a fact brother branham would stand on the stage to show that same melchizedek sign forgive me if you're looking for another another messenger like what we had to show those gifts there's not another one there's not another one you can you can search you can search the internet and they're going to tell you all kind of bad things on brother branham and all kinds of nonsense but why don't you throw that internet away because that same internet is going to say these things about jesus [Applause] and if you search deep enough there's there's somebody in that's in your enemy camp that's gonna say some things about you so that discredits you i went to the internet and i found a lot of thoughts on brother branham hey he wasn't god news bulletin brother branham wasn't god he was a human being he made mistakes he was honest the guy that i'm talking about today abraham i want to talk to you a little bit he had a flaw now god could have killed sarah because she laughed at him but because she was part of the promise he asked her a question is there anything too hard for god the answer to that question if you're still looking for it is there's nothing too hard for god because it's the same god that created the sun try that out for starters you know hey all but all these other gods well all these other gods didn't create the sun the gods of the nba they didn't create the sun the gods of the nfl they didn't create the sun they may make a hundred million dollars for throwing a ball through a hoop but they didn't create the sun they'll bury them in a few days and they're going to need to know the god of the sun [Applause] and he asked her is there anything too hard for the lord now now here's where we come we're in the last day message we're a people that will take a body change universally around the world there are churches that are just like us in many ways around the world that believe this message with all of their heart they've translated it they've got it on computers some of them are behind or some of them are just getting it but let me just say don't never get yourself all caught up on people just getting it because jesus gives you a parable about 11th our workers they're going to get the same reward that the ones because god's going to get received let me just say he's all in the business about getting his seat he knows how to find them where to find them he knows exactly where to get to them now abraham's had some incredible visitations now he's just walking in it he's just basking in it he's testifying in it the message is now abraham and sarah we're going to have children and these children are going to be the heritage of god and he could i'd say oh abraham could do some preaching right there my children are going to come through me as old as i am i don't know how god's going to do it but god's going to have a lineage god's going the messiah is going to come through here i want you to understand i've come to a revelation that the messiah is going to come through this sea adam fell in the garden he listened to the wrong voice and he redeemed eve with his eyes wide open knowing he god would kill her so he loved her so much he gave himself for her as a type of jesus christ now i find it interesting that what i'm getting ready to speak to you over the next 10 to 15 minutes it's not in any it's not any any schools of thoughts of any religion they don't bring it up i've talked to doctors of divinity all over the place i've set with great men that that had great educations had no clue about how abraham and sarah has a baby at this age but brother branham said being the messenger of the day that is going to reveal those hidden mystery thunders and seals the voice of god that spoke to abraham the same voice of god is going to speak to the bride and he's going to drop those mysteries to the bride others will just i don't believe that well it's kind of like acts 2 38 you can see it in the scriptures that's the only way anybody was baptized in the book of acts was in the name of the lord jesus christ the name of the lord jesus that's the way they were born that's the way they were put into the water and it is the it is literally revokes the jurisdiction of satan of your sins off of you are you with me the blood washes you the water washes you the word's going to wash you and it's going to fill you with life that you'll live the life of jesus christ but matthew writes it and he literally has it as a mystery baptize them in the name of the father and of the son out of the holy ghost none of those are names they're titles there are titles and the reason it has to be a mystery because the mystery is jesus christ being god and the trinitarians refused to receive that jesus was god in human flesh he was the fullness of the godhead bodily [Music] he was both man and god we ought to shout right there [Applause] jesus would say i am the resurrection and the love lay this body down and i'll take it up again in three days i my father are one for that reason those jews that were oneness god or they were one god belief they knew that if jesus was god their religion was wrong and they had missed the messiah they didn't go to stone him because of the miracles they didn't go to stone him because of he was a great preacher he identified himself as god he turns around to his disciples says whom do men say that are the son of man out some said thou art jeremiah or one of the prophets but he said who do you say that i am now this is the important key 2000 years later if you can't see who jesus is you'll never see who you are because he's king and your queen and he came to redeem you are you with me he didn't send a man he came himself he sent a lot of prophets as he was descending down through the gentile through the through the jewish seven church ages he sent prophets and they were images of god and there was parts of god but he had to come himself he came as a theophany body in the tent of abraham but he had to come himself to redeem you why did he have to redeem you now we come to this point abraham is walking and as he's walking something happens brother vernon they wake up one morning and a 100 year old man looks like a 20 year old man and when tara and and when sarah breaks through the veil oh [Music] [Applause] you know what i'm talking about right here i don't have to explain i don't have to go on no longer here brother branham the seer of this age would call her the most beautiful woman let me just say when god does a job he does it well now they got in problems god tested their faith and now they're going to move and in their move in their move there's a testimony comes forth that they have turned young help me right here lord so somewhere another when they get 300 miles away to where the rain is still falling you know and and they get there brother branham calls him backslidden he calls him a lion shyster that's what he calls him i mean brother i'm just plain honest our faith of our fathers the the man himself is now in a mess he enters the city how many of you men this father's day let me get a little sideways here just for a second how many you men walk into the room and the most beautiful woman in the room is on your arm [Applause] that's what i'm talking about you know that makes this five foot five red-headed guy you know she puts her arm up under me and kind of scrooges up the side of me you know make me feel 20 again and he walks into the city remember his father's dead and he walks into this city and the king notices who's on his arm and he says tell him you're my sister because being the most beautiful woman i just kill you i keep so emma leach being a king being a righteous man he just chooses her now this is interesting he takes her to his castle to be taken care of by his attendance tomorrow i'll marry you you'll be queen tomorrow think about that sarah you'll be queen now i want i want to just bring up a lot of things right quick what a mess they're in what a mess they not god they are in god didn't get them into this god didn't get them here they got their self here now let's just think about it just for a moment within 24 hours she's going to be the queen she has been for for for 90 years a barren woman how does she tell her story i've been 90 years of barren woman 90 years i felt cursed because i couldn't have a child but there was a man came from another realm and he he asked me a question is there anything too hard for the lord he looked into my eyes and i'll tell you just a few days ago i got a body change and now i'm i've lied i mean i've told him i'm a sister and now this king wants me to be his queen but there's a promise [Applause] there's a promise it's got to come forth there's an isaac that's going to be born there's iran that's got to be born there's a lot of people that's got to be born can you imagine what abraham was thinking now i've served god these years i've offered lambs i've offered sheep i've offered all for the sacrifice i've talked to god i have talked to god face to face he's came to my tent i don't have no question to know that the god that has made this promise i've led my wife down here i've led my wife i've led my family into this situation i've led the lamb's book i've read the lamb's book into a spot to where i can't do anything about it i physically can't do anything about it this mess is way beyond me i'm talking to you you've been in that spot in your life where you're beyond bankrupt word your relationships are beyond fixable where your jobs is beyond destroyed it's not over till god says it's over [Applause] i cannot imagine abraham's thoughts of how bad a mess he was in the god that had now restored his body and now here i lay looking at the stars he told me to look at i can reach out into my tent and i can feel the sand that he told me to count i'm in a mess i'm in a mess i'm in a real mess here now god goes to work because they've just did what is going to go under the seals because now god has proved to humanity you can't do this on your own even when i'm walking with you you can't do this on your own so don't get yourself so self-righteous to think that i'm doing this let me just say you can't breathe your own now you can say now i lay me down to sleep and you don't have a promise of waking up tomorrow morning i'm not the only one under a death trap here we're all in the same situation we're one heartbeat away from god i don't care how much money you got what kind of house you got what kind of car you drove i don't care what you do oh brother ron i got a job that's way up yonder to someone another what do you do one heart beat and you're naked on a slab next that you come in here and naked you're gonna leave and the only thing that's going to be good about you is your character and whether you've got jesus or not bridge brothers god goes to ambulance because amulets is a righteous man he can speak to him now god has to have them to wayward has to you know even in your backslidden state god has to watch over you and so he has to have you to go a certain way so that you'll fulfill the will of god jonah did it and don't have time but maybe jonah did it brother branham did it you're going to do it and so god just leads him down to a righteous king the man that he could speak to and god talks to him he said the man that you're going to have as a wife he's another man's wife he's another man's wife and he said you're as good as a dead man and not only this i'll close up every womb he just opened sarah's womb and now due to this situation this mess if you marry her if you go beyond my word tonight if you marry her i'll close up every womb your nation will die how important a statement is that brother ron we'll just have other let me just say sodom and gor gemara will never produce one child it is a death trap of satan don't care what kind of emojis that you put out it's a death prayer it's a death trap of satan so he realizes as a king he's in a mess there's a lot of people in a mess right here okay i've just espoused myself to the most beautiful woman i've ever saw but she's lied she's told me that she's abraham's sister and i believed her and she's lied about this now god says i gotta go ask abraham for forgiveness [Music] god says go down under my line prophet brother brent says go down under my line shaxton prophet he'll put his hands on you and the curse will be taken away from [Applause] i'm saying something to you right here god's with you even in your message [Applause] two men were fighting they were fighting to death both had guns both at knives one run from the other the other was determined to kill him so one thought he was running to a safe place so he ran to a church the other one we're out and right in sit down right beside of him preacher don't know what he's preaching but he's preaching and he preaches about an hour and a half and god gets a hold of both of these men both of these men walk to the altar and lay their guns and their knives on the altar they later became deacons of that church don't tell me god don't know how to take care of messes [Applause] young man's a pilot he goes to the bank he's a good-looking man the woman behind the counter is a little older being very delicate little older there but she's beautiful she's dignified she's everything he sees in a woman they don't believe nothing and he just keeps coming back i want to take you out she said i'll set you up with dates i'll set you up i'll set you up i'll set you up there's a lot of younger women here that that are interested they're looking for somebody like you know i want you i want you and he does that repetitively for a long time and finally she goes out on a date with him and she's married and now they've lived many many anniversaries how do we put things together and we go how did that happen how did that happen you guys wanted the church in martinsburg isn't it right you wanted one you guys wanted a church there y'all wanted me to preach there but look where you're sitting now that's about 10 years ago here you are sister joyce i've got things right you came here to try to get linda out of this mess and you fell in love with it too i met some chinese people the other day that came to china came from china to get their their sister their family out of the mess that they were in this this horrible cult that they were in that they had given themselves to and now the woman that walked through the prayer line the same prayer line that michael got called to preach now that woman basically interprets every live service into chinese [Laughter] god god must set and grin when prophecies are coming together and going shhh and time and prophecy intercepts and there you are so brother branham is saying you know they turned back young again can't you see it that kink would have never lusted over a hundred year old woman and it's thought so hidden in the scriptures until through all of those generations it was a mystery and here stands a little kentucky prophet standing with the mighty angel opening the word for him because it's a needed word because you're in a mess the church world's in a mess education's in a mess the moral conditions in a mess it's not just american politics in a mess the whole world's in a mess [Applause] i don't know who's going to be the witnesses that see me red-headed again i just happen to believe i'm going to live long enough to see that happen [Applause] sir can i get can i have just a few more seconds i said at your son's funeral and there was a video that was going on and there was pictures pictures of when you guys were young and i i sat in the family section with you thank you for letting me do that but i had my own i had my own guy here showing me who was who and who was who you're knowing and so as he would show me now that's linda and that's joyce and that's linda and that's joyce and i would get them confused and maybe was chemo fog i was just i was just confused and so i just and i go connie he just told me that that was linda and that's choice well one of these days you're going to walk through these doors and you're going to look like that and i'm going to know because you told me [Laughter] are you getting it god knows how to take a flaw [Applause] he needs to take an incredible flow in your life and so provide grace and mercy hallelujah i i i i wanted to just say something brother david mayer said something kellie gildebrand said something the other day that he just said it in kind of passing and i i didn't even catch it but i i got to thinking on that thing he said when the rapture happens around the world god has to take people that no doubt don't look ready and make them ready in seconds what a mighty god what a mighty god that we serve this is way over my pay grade way beyond your thinking well this is the way it's going to be are you really sure about that god has to take this worldwide culture education people that don't have a church they're under a tree worshiping listen no doubt many home churches many that have to stream because they live hundreds and hundreds of miles away and it's gonna cause such a reunion on this earth the sea is going to give forth their dead the biggest graveyard in the whole world is the ocean and they're going to give forth their dead and the people that have their bones have already went back to the molecules god's gonna bring it from the gases and they're gonna stand in world bodies from one dimension to another dimension step forth and we're going to gather here [Applause] in this whole chaos of mess just before our home going hallelujah hallelujah musicians if you would call me what a day that will be when my jesus i shall see [Music] what a day [Music] when i look upon his faith the one who saved me by his grace [Music] through [Music] glorious day that will be let's sing it again [Music] i shall see is [Music] leads me through [Music] the brothers [Music] noah is going to get baptized this morning [Music] come but no i want you to stand beside me god made noah special called his name noah they did he's born in an incredible family he didn't do that himself as a matter of fact he had to look at nothing to do with it [Music] he didn't call he didn't get himself here we know the history as far as his grandfather being a message interpreter for decades he's standing now watching in another realm if he's allowed to look through the veil his father made a choice to believe the word with all of his heart he's raising a family [Music] we are taught here that we don't make our children we just create an atmosphere to where they'll just walk right into it noah's been wanting to get baptized for quite a while looking for the precious that that gracious moment that father was brother william was today he wants to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ now you see you see when abraham was laying there in that night sky looking at the stars he was looking there was another if you can't have grace for others there will not be grace for you [Music] gotta have mercy gotta have mercy you see noah had to find this spot today i know i don't know i don't think you will but you've been flirting with my granddaughter [Music] so we're going to baptize that as well [Applause] [Music] if time lasts no grow up and know this god was more than a historical god i didn't know him as his god because that's what he's been taught in his home they listen to the message every day [Music] neil married no doubt a believer that believes it and they'll produce children because they were also taught by melchizedek but one day noah will go from this dimension to another dimension as a believer [Music] the rapture happens in a few days noah will probably be taller than me a whole lot more handsome [Music] and you'll have a wife that's unbelievable but god knows how to fix everything in a moment we were born in sin in a mess we were shaping in iniquity in a mess but our god was rich in his mercy and with his great love he loves us more than we can even imagine [Music] you'll come as well [Music] shall see is [Music] oh what a day [Music] there will be no sorrows there i think [Music] no more [Music] and forever [Music] me [Music] [Music] shall see face the one who saved me by his grace [Music] glorious day [Music] me [Music] tried and true [Music] is [Music] for you [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] true [Music] me

great representation of his family amen god bless you heavenly father lord we are so thrilled to be here today for this moment noah has given his heart to god believes his word and wants to take a step a step of salvation repent and be baptized to every one of you in the name of the lord jesus christ and noah hasn't sinned but this rejoken of the jurisdiction of sins go back on his fathers and fathers and fathers mothers and mothers and mothers the dna that planted down through his life now is not hidden against him no more he becomes innocent father by the blood of the lamb the word we stand here today now they would take a sacrifice and wash it whether it be a goat or turtle dog but today god requires that we are washed and so we baptize brother noah in the name of the lord jesus christ [Applause] thank you god has a great great blood that takes and god has a certain sermon arranged he knows how to talk about every one of us today's father's day her father's not old and wore
