[37:28] happening has taken place
[37:30] we have brother Nathan Erickson and
[37:32] sister Cheyenne that's with us
[37:34] and we're so honored to have them my
[37:38] mind goes back a long way
[37:40] 1994 when I began to preach it his
[37:43] grandfather's Church
[37:45] on his father's side Brother Ray
[37:48] Erickson
[37:49] and we've had an incredible amount of
[37:51] meetings there since 94 we've been there
[37:55] quite a few times
[37:56] then his grandfather on the other side
[37:59] was brother Samuel Johnson
[38:01] and I was fighting not wanting to ever
[38:04] preach and
[38:06] and I'd go to meetings I was just
[38:08] converted we were just married and we
[38:11] couldn't go to a meeting without
[38:12] somebody calling me out and said you're
[38:14] called to preach young man
[38:16] you're called to preach
[38:18] I'd get mad
[38:22] and so we went to Brother
[38:24] Henry Green's meeting
[38:26] brother Samuel Johnson was preaching
[38:29] unbeknownst to me I was staying right
[38:31] beside her brother Samuel
[38:33] sister Connie and myself and we
[38:36] we didn't have children then and
[38:38] and I I went to take some luggage out to
[38:41] the to the car
[38:44] I didn't know what the brother Samuel
[38:45] was sitting in the van with his foot the
[38:49] door opened foot up in the where the
[38:51] mirror would be on just on the inside
[38:53] and he was sitting with his foot and he
[38:55] I walked past him he said young man
[38:59] yes yes sir
[39:02] he said I don't know you
[39:07] but there's a light following you
[39:10] and he said you're called to preach and
[39:12] he just kind of grabbed me and kind of
[39:14] held me you know and he said your
[39:17] ministry will Eclipse mine
[39:20] I was thinking he's the speaker of this
[39:22] meeting and
[39:23] and he said and you'll lead tens of
[39:26] thousands
[39:27] to the Lord
[39:32] and now his grandson is going to preach
[39:34] for us tonight
[39:36] so I woke up with a lot of emotions
[39:38] today and so we just are so thankful
[39:41] sister Cheyenne so glad to have you with
[39:44] us and and uh I hope you get a chance to
[39:47] meet them and
[39:48] uh they're just they're just incredible
[39:50] preacher and he's an incredible preacher
[39:53] amen and so we he's got good Bloodlines
[39:56] and so we're just you pull on the gift
[39:59] and God will operate that gift and so
[40:01] we're so honored to have him with us
[40:04] tonight emotional day
[40:07] I I want to share one more thing with
[40:09] you
[40:10] we went to eat with them today and and
[40:13] Connie said I need to go buy a store and
[40:16] I I said okay
[40:17] and so so she went by a store and Andrew
[40:21] went with us and he said actually he
[40:24] says what's she doing I said I have no
[40:26] idea
[40:28] and she had dropped something off she
[40:29] had to pick it up and so when she came
[40:31] out
[40:32] she said I guess I need to give you
[40:34] something
[40:36] and I said okay
[40:39] 16 years ago they cut This Ring Off
[40:44] when they cut it off they asked me
[40:47] you have any last words
[40:50] I said I do
[40:53] Dr Kramer told me he said I thought I
[40:55] was
[40:56] was the last words you'd ever say
[41:00] and I looked over at Homer and Thomas
[41:03] and I told them I love you
[41:07] and they put me to sleep
[41:09] for a month
[41:12] and that ring I hadn't seen it again
[41:14] until today

[43:01] mother-in-law God bless your heart
[43:07] and Sarah
[43:10] Jesus changed his life
[43:12] forever and so did Sarah
[43:17] brother Branham talks about it when a
[43:19] man marries a woman he marries a woman
[43:21] that is is actually his character
[43:24] said that reflects the inside of him
[43:27] and he said when he marries her he said
[43:29] what they've done they stepped out of
[43:31] Eternity into a space of time
[43:35] and then one day they'll step back into
[43:37] eternity again amen amen so if you guys

[43:45] going to have a crew and we're going to
[43:47] and
[43:48] however you come will be happy but
[43:51] but please comment I'd like for you all
[43:53] to come
[43:54] I like for you all cloy you're part of
[43:56] the family now too so
[44:01] Mark I want you to come
[44:04] I want you to Mark if you would say
[44:06] prayer for us here
[44:11] amen Right Here Comes one of my little
[44:13] buddies
[44:15] her name's Aaliyah
[44:19] it's interesting that
[44:22] it's interesting that Zoe can't say a
[44:25] lot of words
[44:27] but she can say Aaliyah
[44:32] the most clear yeah yeah that's right
[44:35] [Laughter]
[44:38] amen amen God bless you Amen brother
[44:42] Gabriel and Sister Sarah
[44:47] Amen brother Mark if you'll come stand
[44:50] by my side if you will
[44:52] God bless you all
[44:54] amen
[44:59] it's a great day it is we're just
[45:01] getting started here
[45:03] maybe they'll have 10.
[45:07] glory to God
[45:12] that's not a prophecy that's just a wish
[45:16] amen I think we're too close to the
[45:18] Rapture for all that
[45:20] amen
[45:21] in a baby dedication it's important
[45:25] the importance is is because Jesus was
[45:27] brought
[45:29] and he was brought for circumcision but
[45:32] it was also for dedication
[45:35] and so Jesus would take out time
[45:38] as well as our Prophet did
[45:41] and brother Abraham had incredible you
[45:43] know he's going to preach two or three
[45:44] hours maybe four
[45:46] but he would maybe dedicate 10 babies
[45:50] because he felt it so important
[45:53] and so today we come for
[45:56] for Uriah Judah
[45:58] and the scripture says that hear o
[46:01] Israel the Lord our God
[46:04] the Lord is one
[46:07] love the Lord your God with all your
[46:10] heart with all your soul
[46:13] and with all your strength
[46:16] and these Commandments that I give you
[46:19] today
[46:20] are to be upon your hearts
[46:23] press them upon your children
[46:25] talk about them when you sit down
[46:28] at home and when you walk along the road
[46:32] and when you lie down and when you get
[46:34] up
[46:36] we grew up in that kind of home amen
[46:40] first Samuel chapter 1 and verse 27.
[46:44] I prayed for this child
[46:51] and the Lord is granting me
[46:54] what I asked for
[46:56] so now
[46:58] I give him to the Lord
[47:01] for his whole life
[47:04] he will be given over to the Lord
[47:09] and they Worship the Lord there
[47:14] you named him special
[47:17] an incredible name a very powerful name
[47:22] Uriah means Yahweh is light
[47:26] you named him after God
[47:29] put in your second name the middle name
[47:33] you called him Judah
[47:36] and it was Leah
[47:38] that was married to Jacob that was so
[47:41] hated
[47:43] when she gave birth to Judah
[47:47] that name means praise
[47:51] it also is an attributed to the lion of
[47:53] the tribe of Judah
[47:57] and I think about how powerful this name
[47:59] is
[48:00] for those that don't know
[48:02] brother Branham
[48:04] that would that would have many special
[48:07] friends
[48:08] so when I get to heaven
[48:11] the first man I'd like to shake hands
[48:13] with
[48:14] is Uriah
[48:16] who was a soldier in David's Army
[48:20] and he was a dedicated man
[48:23] and he was bathsheba's husband
[48:26] and he refused to go lie with Bathsheba
[48:29] because his brothers was at War
[48:32] and I want you to remember the other
[48:34] part of that he was a gentile
[48:38] he was a gentile and being a gentile he
[48:41] had no promise to him
[48:43] but because he was fighting for his King
[48:46] it brought him into the Covenant
[48:50] I'd say that's pretty special this guy
[48:52] is going to be a really special little
[48:54] fella
[48:55] with this child you have a charge
[48:59] and God reminds us that God gave him to
[49:02] you
[49:03] and he's in your home
[49:06] now we're going to give him back to God
[49:11] now you'll watch over him
[49:13] and you'll take care of him you'll do
[49:14] your best of raising you'll do your best
[49:17] to protecting
[49:19] you'll be your best to watch over him
[49:21] and be with him and help him with his
[49:23] friendships
[49:25] you took him out and changed his diapers
[49:27] so he'd be clean for this event
[49:31] in all things you will do your absolute
[49:34] best
[49:35] I have that confidence in you
[49:37] and God gave him to you through your
[49:41] wounds
[49:43] now you're giving him back to God and in
[49:46] doing so
[49:48] God has a covenant with you that he'll
[49:52] watch over him and he'll protect him
[49:55] and this Covenant will be with him until
[49:58] he gets to the age of accountability
[50:02] and at the age of accountability he'll
[50:04] be given choice
[50:06] so you were his holy ghost until he gets
[50:09] to the age of accountability and you'll
[50:12] do a good job
[50:15] and in doing so then we know that he has
[50:18] a 97 percent better chance
[50:21] because what we believe is
[50:24] stepping out of a realm of time
[50:27] he was manifested now as the physical
[50:30] attribute
[50:32] of god of what he thought of before the
[50:34] foundation of the world
[50:37] Uriah
[50:38] was written there
[50:40] and now he's living
[50:42] how big was he when he was born
[50:45] four pounds and two ounces
[50:48] amen
[50:50] amen Mark I'm I'm going to hold him
[50:52] first
[50:55] oh
[50:57] and we're going to get pictures and then
[50:59] you're going to hold him and get
[51:01] pictures come crowding come grandma

[1:04:04] but uh because of what the ministry here
[1:04:06] and and the fellowship here has meant to
[1:04:08] us over the years I think the last time
[1:04:10] I was in this church I was just a little
[1:04:12] boy
[1:04:13] not any kind of a preacher or anything
[1:04:15] still not but but I have a lifetime of
[1:04:18] memories and testimonies I can look back
[1:04:21] on with brother Ron as he said first
[1:04:24] time he came and preached for us I
[1:04:25] believe I was about four years old
[1:04:28] we've seen so much Supernatural
[1:04:31] amen so much evidence of a living God
[1:04:34] amen so we just preach you very much for
[1:04:36] the wrong we bring a lot of greetings
[1:04:37] from back home from the church there
[1:04:39] from Brother Wayne from the Erickson
[1:04:41] family
[1:04:42] and uh and we're just believing with you
[1:04:44] for a miracle amen amen there's uh
[1:04:48] Saints back home fervently praying and
[1:04:50] believing amen and expecting
[1:04:53] amen and we appreciate brother Andrew he
[1:04:56] uh he's a real celebrity around our
[1:04:58] parts Our Youth Camp preacher in a
[1:05:00] little less than a month we're we're
[1:05:02] looking forward to having him with us
[1:05:03] and brother Ron coming up as well boy
[1:05:06] we're excited amen amen so we just uh my
[1:05:10] mind is there with this young generation
[1:05:12] and what the Lord is doing we're seeing
[1:05:15] very very exciting things
[1:05:17] transpiring right now right in this time
[1:05:19] this season amen and with this Young
[1:05:22] Generation with the the ones that are
[1:05:25] coming up taking the Baton amen we're
[1:05:28] just excited about what the Lord is
[1:05:30] doing so with that in mind I'd like to
[1:05:33] not keep it too long tonight and go
[1:05:35] right to the word and Joshua the first
[1:05:37] chapter
[1:05:38] of course I'm a little nervous tonight
[1:05:39] not because I'm scared of you because I
[1:05:42] love you
[1:05:43] amen and
[1:05:45] so I'm going to take a moment here just
[1:05:46] to get feeling right at home Joshua
[1:05:49] chapter one I've been looking at this
[1:05:52] this passage of scripture it's very
[1:05:54] timely I think I think the beautiful
[1:05:55] thing about the Joshua type is it's
[1:05:58] timely no matter what generation you're
[1:05:59] a part of
[1:06:00] amen because we're all having the same
[1:06:02] experience
[1:06:03] amen of bringing God out of History
[1:06:06] amen and looking for a manifestation in
[1:06:08] our own day a fulfillment of the promise
[1:06:10] so we'll read the Joshua commission it's
[1:06:13] very familiar to us all verses one to
[1:06:14] nine here in the Book of Joshua
[1:06:17] the Bible says now after the death of
[1:06:19] Moses the servant of the Lord it came to
[1:06:22] pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the
[1:06:25] son of nun Moses his minister or servant
[1:06:27] saying Moses my servant is dead now
[1:06:31] therefore arise and go over this Jordan
[1:06:33] thou and all this people unto the land
[1:06:36] which I do give to them even to the
[1:06:38] children of Israel every place that the
[1:06:40] soul of your foot shall tread upon that
[1:06:42] have I given unto you as I said unto
[1:06:44] Moses from the Wilderness and this
[1:06:46] Lebanon even unto the great river
[1:06:48] Euphrates all the land of the Hittites
[1:06:50] and unto the great sea toward the going
[1:06:52] down of the sun shall be your Coast
[1:06:54] there shall not any man be able to stand
[1:06:57] before thee all the days of thy life as
[1:07:00] I was with Moses amen precious words so
[1:07:04] I will be with thee I will not fail thee
[1:07:06] nor forsake thee be strong and of a good
[1:07:09] courage For unto this people shout out
[1:07:12] divide for an inheritance the lamb which
[1:07:14] I swear unto their fathers to give them
[1:07:16] only be thou strong and very courageous
[1:07:18] that thou mayest observe to do according
[1:07:20] to all the law which Moses my servant
[1:07:23] commanded thee turn not from it to the
[1:07:25] right hand or to the left
[1:07:28] that thou mayest Prosper whether so ever
[1:07:30] thou goest the book of the law shall not
[1:07:33] depart out of thy mouth but Thou shalt
[1:07:35] meditate therein day and night that thou
[1:07:37] mayest observe to do according to all
[1:07:39] that is written therein for then Thou
[1:07:42] shalt make thy way prosperous and then
[1:07:44] Thou shalt have good success
[1:07:46] have not I commanded thee be strong and
[1:07:49] of a good courage Be not Afraid neither
[1:07:52] be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is
[1:07:54] with thee withersoever thou goest amen
[1:07:57] May Lord bless the word let's just have
[1:07:59] a word of prayer Heavenly Father Lord
[1:08:02] we're looking to you tonight Lord
[1:08:06] to be the fulfiller of every promise
[1:08:09] Lord we have nothing of ourselves to
[1:08:11] offer and yet Lord we we find a call a
[1:08:15] commission in your word
[1:08:17] father that we are to be the ones
[1:08:20] that possess the promise and Lord we
[1:08:22] look at the time that we're living in we
[1:08:24] look at all the types of the scripture
[1:08:25] and everything testifying Lord Lord that
[1:08:28] we should be expecting a great move of
[1:08:30] God in this day Lord you sent a prophet
[1:08:32] to tell us that the move was on in The
[1:08:34] Bride of Jesus Christ but we're thankful
[1:08:35] Lord that that's no Theory to us lord
[1:08:38] it's not a mental conception but Lord
[1:08:40] we're living in the reality of it and I
[1:08:42] pray father you'd open up your word
[1:08:44] tonight Lord by your spirit that Lord we
[1:08:46] could just see a little more clearly
[1:08:48] what you've called us to do Lord of who
[1:08:50] we are in your eyes Lord and and may you
[1:08:53] make it a fulfilled thing in every life
[1:08:55] I pray Lord we have nothing to offer
[1:08:57] Lord we're completely insufficient Lord
[1:09:00] we're looking to you may you come down
[1:09:01] tonight Lord and and take these vessels
[1:09:04] of clay may you be the speaker tonight
[1:09:06] Lord may you also be The Interpreter
[1:09:09] Lord and from the beginning to the end
[1:09:11] Lord may it be a quickened thing of your
[1:09:13] spirit Lord that you would have complete
[1:09:15] control Lord we want to just get out of
[1:09:17] your way tonight as we dedicate
[1:09:18] ourselves and dedicate this service to
[1:09:20] you in the name of Jesus Christ amen God
[1:09:23] bless you as you're seated tonight
[1:09:25] amen I want to try not to keep you long
[1:09:27] amen but I'd just like to say a few
[1:09:30] words about the Joshua generation amen
[1:09:33] the Joshua generation and how many
[1:09:35] believe that the Joshua type applies to
[1:09:37] the Bride of Jesus Christ amen I I
[1:09:40] believe that with all of my heart we
[1:09:42] know that we've had a Ministry in our
[1:09:44] day a man of an end time prophet and
[1:09:46] that prophet's Ministry was a Joshua
[1:09:48] Ministry amen he had that from the angel
[1:09:50] of the Lord he preached the message as I
[1:09:52] was with Moses so I will be with thee
[1:09:55] Amen in spoken words The Original Seed
[1:09:57] brother Branham said that Joshua
[1:09:58] represents the promised end time leader
[1:10:01] who would take the church over and Caleb
[1:10:04] would represent the True Believer who
[1:10:06] stayed with Joshua amen and in a paradox
[1:10:09] he said that Joshua is a type of the
[1:10:10] last day Ministry so brother Branham
[1:10:12] could look at this type in the Bible and
[1:10:14] he could apply it to his own day and
[1:10:16] even to his own Ministry that he would
[1:10:18] be a Joshua Ministry that would lead the
[1:10:20] Church of God into a land of full
[1:10:22] promise fulfillment amen amen but I I
[1:10:25] believe that Joshua not only has things
[1:10:27] to represent just the end time profit
[1:10:29] but I believe that that Joshua
[1:10:31] represents the end time believer amen
[1:10:34] amen it's a it's an anointing or a
[1:10:36] commission which is on the Church of God
[1:10:38] Amen to to go into the land of promise
[1:10:41] and possess everything that God has said
[1:10:43] that the church should be in possession
[1:10:45] of amen amen that that's the great thing
[1:10:48] about the Joshua type is it applies to
[1:10:50] every generation no matter what time
[1:10:51] that you're living in you can look back
[1:10:53] and see a god of History you see that
[1:10:55] Jesus Christ was something yesterday
[1:10:57] amen but there has to be a cry in the
[1:10:59] Christian heart and say to say I want to
[1:11:02] see Jesus Christ the same today as he
[1:11:04] was yesterday and I want to have I want
[1:11:06] to believe that that tomorrow he'll be
[1:11:08] the same that he is today and the same
[1:11:10] that he was yesterday amen amen and so I
[1:11:13] believe that I believe that we are a
[1:11:15] Joshua people brother Brandon preach the
[1:11:16] message adoption and he said that our
[1:11:19] Ephesians or our Joshua remember he said
[1:11:21] there has to be an Ephesians to this
[1:11:22] amen there has to be a fulfillment to
[1:11:25] this message and he said our Ephesians
[1:11:27] our Joshua is the Holy Spirit and he is
[1:11:30] our great warrior and he is our great
[1:11:32] leader and he said as God was with
[1:11:34] Joshua so is God in the Holy Spirit
[1:11:37] moving us about amen now if you're
[1:11:40] living a Christian Life that's got no
[1:11:41] movement you've got no direction there's
[1:11:43] no vision amen you're not looking for
[1:11:45] God to be doing something right now in
[1:11:47] the present time then then brother
[1:11:49] you've missed the commission amen
[1:11:51] because God sent a message or to tell
[1:11:53] you under Vindication he said thus saith
[1:11:56] the Lord it's not any man's idea it's
[1:11:58] not some some kind of a emotional workup
[1:12:01] or or just somebody trying to
[1:12:02] manufacture a Revival it's the saith the
[1:12:05] Lord that there is a move on for the
[1:12:07] Bride of Jesus Christ and I can show you
[1:12:09] in the message where he started the move
[1:12:11] but you can't show me where he ever
[1:12:13] called it off amen I believe the god
[1:12:15] that moved 60 years ago is moving today
[1:12:18] I believe he's moving tonight amen I
[1:12:20] believe anyone who's a god enough to
[1:12:22] Joshua anointing on them amen to believe
[1:12:24] that we'll see a move of God in their
[1:12:26] life they'll catch up Vision they'll
[1:12:28] catch a direction from this message
[1:12:30] you're not just sitting on your hands
[1:12:31] waiting for a Rapture today you're going
[1:12:33] somewhere Church there's a leadership in
[1:12:35] The Bride of Jesus Christ there's a
[1:12:37] headship there is a vision hallelujah
[1:12:39] amen brother Branham said there's got to
[1:12:42] be a Joshua of this day he preached as I
[1:12:44] was with Moses and I think it's amazing
[1:12:46] most of the time he's comparing himself
[1:12:48] to Moses in a message that was supposed
[1:12:50] to represent him as a Joshua but he also
[1:12:53] said there'd be a spiritual Joshua in
[1:12:55] the last day a Joshua believer amen now
[1:12:58] how many are interested to know how
[1:13:00] brother Branham would Define a Joshua
[1:13:02] believer and I think he's going to pick
[1:13:04] a few scriptures here and he's going to
[1:13:06] and and so it's a prophet that's drawn
[1:13:08] the highlights it's a prophet that's
[1:13:10] putting the emphasis and says hey if
[1:13:12] there's a spiritual Joshua in the end
[1:13:13] time here's the here's the word that
[1:13:16] he's going to go with and brother bran
[1:13:18] said uh uh Joshua of this day if the
[1:13:20] Bible said except a man be born again he
[1:13:24] cannot see the kingdom of God the
[1:13:26] spiritual Joshua will say the the same
[1:13:28] thing if the Bible said Jesus Christ the
[1:13:31] same yesterday today and forever the
[1:13:35] spiritual Joshua will say the same thing
[1:13:37] amen as Peter on the day of Pentecost
[1:13:39] said receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:13:41] the spiritual Joshua will never vary one
[1:13:44] iota amen but he said he'll make just
[1:13:47] exactly what the word said if Mark 16
[1:13:49] said these signs shall follow them that
[1:13:52] believe amen the spiritual Joshua will
[1:13:55] say the same thing Amen brother
[1:13:57] branham's telling you in this end time
[1:13:59] amen if you're looking for a Joshua
[1:14:01] commission if you're looking for a
[1:14:03] Joshua Church it'll be a church that
[1:14:05] believes in the baptism of the Holy
[1:14:07] Ghost believes that the the signs and
[1:14:10] wonders shall follow them that believe
[1:14:11] believes that Jesus Christ is not a
[1:14:13] story out of a history book but he's the
[1:14:16] same today with the same power the same
[1:14:18] signs the same baptism amen the same
[1:14:22] feelings the same Sensations
[1:14:24] hallelujah amen God he'll have one
[1:14:28] he'll have a Joshua don't be afraid of
[1:14:31] that amen amen this thing ain't
[1:14:33] conquered yet but he's got a Joshua and
[1:14:36] actually when God removed Moses off the
[1:14:38] scene
[1:14:39] no doubt it was a time of great
[1:14:41] consternation it was a you know it was
[1:14:43] it was much confusion amongst the people
[1:14:46] because they thought Moses would take
[1:14:47] them all the way in
[1:14:49] but and so when God took Moses off the
[1:14:51] scene a lot of people got shook a lot of
[1:14:54] people were unsettled but he already had
[1:14:57] somebody on the scene he already had a
[1:15:00] Joshua Amen to fulfill Moses his message
[1:15:03] God wasn't worried friends amen God
[1:15:06] wasn't concerned amen the wheels of
[1:15:08] predestination were already turning amen
[1:15:11] when God took his Prophet off the scene
[1:15:12] it was only to put a Joshua in his place
[1:15:15] amen and Joshua would take a whole
[1:15:17] people into the land amen and so don't
[1:15:21] think just because brother Branham amen
[1:15:23] has passed away that there's no Joshua
[1:15:25] Ministry that that there's no Joshua
[1:15:27] commission for the church friends we've
[1:15:28] had a lot of people come say hey Hey
[1:15:30] brother branham's died now you got to
[1:15:32] follow me we've had a lot of eighth
[1:15:34] Messengers we had a lot of Kingdom
[1:15:35] Builders we had a lot of personalities
[1:15:37] and celebrities and amen and opportunist
[1:15:40] around the message amen but listen we're
[1:15:43] not looking for that we're not looking
[1:15:45] for that but well we're looking for amen
[1:15:48] is is for the God that was to be the god
[1:15:51] that is amen I say as long as there are
[1:15:54] Holy Ghost filled spirit-led Sons and
[1:15:57] Daughters of God this Joshua ministry
[1:16:00] will continue until we possess every
[1:16:02] square inch of our adoption until we
[1:16:05] fulfill every promise until we defeat
[1:16:07] every devil until the molecules of this
[1:16:10] body amen change from Mortal to
[1:16:14] immortality
[1:16:15] this Joshua Ministry is going to go on
[1:16:17] Amen this bride's Revival didn't die in
[1:16:20] 1965. it's more alive today than it ever
[1:16:24] was
[1:16:26] amen look around you're living in it
[1:16:28] it's the greatest day
[1:16:31] amen
[1:16:34] Joshua was more than a general Joshua
[1:16:37] was an Army Joshua was a movement he was
[1:16:40] a power
[1:16:41] Hallelujah
[1:16:43] Hallelujah
[1:16:45] brother Bram said he said if he doesn't
[1:16:47] come in my generation he said I know not
[1:16:50] I hope so but I know that there will be
[1:16:52] young men that will raise up that'll
[1:16:54] sweep this message on and they'll take
[1:16:56] this message and sweep it to the coming
[1:16:58] of the Lord amen and he didn't come in
[1:17:01] brother Brown's generation amen but the
[1:17:03] message never stopped amen the last
[1:17:06] never stopped amen the overcoming never
[1:17:08] stopped brother sister amen but there's
[1:17:10] a new generation amen that are called
[1:17:13] not just to be Believers of the message
[1:17:15] but we're called to be fulfillers of the
[1:17:19] message amen that's why we're not
[1:17:21] looking for another word we're not
[1:17:23] looking for some new message some new
[1:17:25] dispensation some new word or some new
[1:17:28] Revival he said they won't take another
[1:17:30] message he said they'll take this
[1:17:32] message and they'll sweep it on to the
[1:17:34] coming of the Lord that's what we're
[1:17:36] doing with all of our hearts Brothers
[1:17:38] history amen as we're running with the
[1:17:40] message God sent amen we're not going to
[1:17:42] lay it down because God took the prophet
[1:17:44] off the scene or cause the years have
[1:17:46] come pass by or because of what some
[1:17:48] teacher said or some Kingdom Builder
[1:17:51] friends where a Joshua generation amen
[1:17:54] God gave Joshua the key to overcome amen
[1:17:57] he gave him gave him a promise but he
[1:17:59] put it on a contingency he said you
[1:18:02] remember the message of Moses
[1:18:04] don't look to the left
[1:18:07] don't look to the right he said you
[1:18:09] remember what Moses preached and you
[1:18:12] take what Moses preached meditated every
[1:18:14] day meditate on it every night Let It Be
[1:18:18] Your Daily Bread Let It Be Your Drive
[1:18:20] Let It Be Your Vision let it be your
[1:18:22] direction and if you'll do that Joshua
[1:18:24] nobody will stand in your way everything
[1:18:27] you lift your hand to will prosper amen
[1:18:30] don't look to the left or the right just
[1:18:32] stay with the message amen we've had
[1:18:34] Nathans and chorus around this message
[1:18:36] that have tinkered with it Decades of
[1:18:38] tampering amen of of correcting of
[1:18:41] trying to fix the message I I just say
[1:18:44] don't mess with the message but if you
[1:18:46] believe the message amen there's a
[1:18:48] promise that goes with it stay true to
[1:18:51] it and he said as I was with William
[1:18:53] Branham
[1:18:55] you with thee
[1:19:00] amen
[1:19:01] amen that ought to go down to the to the
[1:19:04] littlest individual to the youngest
[1:19:06] child to the simplest Christian to the
[1:19:08] lowest status in the church amen don't
[1:19:10] don't look upward friends look inward
[1:19:12] amen because this message has been
[1:19:14] poured out on a generation of people
[1:19:16] amen the promise applies as I was with
[1:19:19] William Branham as I was with Ray
[1:19:21] Erickson as I am with Ron Spencer I'm
[1:19:23] with you amen and I've called you out to
[1:19:26] join this thing I've called you to be an
[1:19:29] overcomer amen I've called you to do the
[1:19:31] exploits I've called you to do the
[1:19:33] overcoming
[1:19:35] Hallelujah stay true to it there's power
[1:19:38] in it there's overcoming in it there's
[1:19:40] purpose in it amen but you got to
[1:19:43] believe it
[1:19:44] you got to stay with it you got to step
[1:19:47] into the water sometime
[1:19:48] sometime in the individual life it's got
[1:19:51] to come down to a place where you got to
[1:19:54] believe it for yourself then brother
[1:19:55] Braham say the revelation of Jesus
[1:19:57] Christ personally to you
[1:19:59] amen and that first step's a hard one
[1:20:01] [Music]
[1:20:02] it's a hard one for many people when you
[1:20:04] come down like Joshua came and he came
[1:20:06] down to the Jordan River and now here's
[1:20:09] the Proving Ground
[1:20:10] because he had all the he had all the
[1:20:12] nice things that Moses said about him he
[1:20:14] had all the you know he had all the
[1:20:16] leadership over the people he had all
[1:20:17] everything established but there was one
[1:20:19] thing in the way and that was an
[1:20:20] impossible obstacle
[1:20:22] amen there's no going around it no going
[1:20:24] under it no going over it
[1:20:26] hey man you got to step into it
[1:20:29] you got to step into it and then no
[1:20:32] doubt you know because Spirits never die
[1:20:33] at that time it was probably like this
[1:20:35] time where a lot of people were saying
[1:20:36] God doesn't do good things like that
[1:20:38] anymore yeah he parted the Red Sea but
[1:20:40] see Moses gone and what are you gonna do
[1:20:42] Joshua
[1:20:44] what are you gonna do
[1:20:46] amen when you get down to that water and
[1:20:48] maybe some people were saying well you
[1:20:50] know maybe maybe Moses will come back
[1:20:51] out of the mountains and someday Moses
[1:20:53] will come back he'll part the water then
[1:20:55] we can be Overcomers then we can have a
[1:20:58] Revival then we can eat the milk and
[1:20:59] honey
[1:21:00] amen and that's what they were looking
[1:21:02] for amen but see Joshua but see that
[1:21:05] Joshua is is there with a commission now
[1:21:08] now you you can't make the commission
[1:21:10] watch this now it's quite amazing if if
[1:21:13] Mo if Joshua's commissioned was just to
[1:21:15] say exactly what Moses said and and do
[1:21:18] exactly just don't even preach Joshua
[1:21:20] don't even get behind the pulpit just
[1:21:21] say what he said just play tape amen
[1:21:23] don't change anything
[1:21:25] then he would have waved his arm
[1:21:28] and he would have waved his arm till it
[1:21:29] fell off and the waters would have never
[1:21:31] parted
[1:21:32] amen but see the God that was over the
[1:21:35] head of Moses when he came to the Red
[1:21:38] Sea that God that looked down with Angry
[1:21:40] Eyes amen now he was in an ark amen and
[1:21:44] Joshua was marching behind that Ark and
[1:21:47] so he gets down to his greatest obstacle
[1:21:49] he couldn't even he wasn't even a square
[1:21:51] one just to take that first step with
[1:21:54] God that's the way it is for many people
[1:21:55] it's the first step is often the hardest
[1:21:57] because oh I don't know if I really
[1:21:59] opened that door to the Lord if if I
[1:22:02] really take that step if I really what
[1:22:04] if I act like that guy or what if
[1:22:07] something happens to me or what if this
[1:22:08] comes out or what if I got to give up
[1:22:10] that it's a hard step but sooner later
[1:22:12] you're gonna have to take it
[1:22:14] amen you can't water in this Wilderness
[1:22:16] forever
[1:22:17] you were born for greater things so he
[1:22:19] comes down to that water and he's going
[1:22:20] to take that step and I think it's
[1:22:22] amazing just put my head in the minds of
[1:22:24] those priests because right up until
[1:22:25] that last inch that foot hovering over
[1:22:28] that Russian water there was absolutely
[1:22:31] nothing to say Amen that they wouldn't
[1:22:34] get just Swept Away immediately
[1:22:36] amen there was nothing nothing there's
[1:22:38] their eyes were saying nothing their
[1:22:41] feelings were saying nothing their ears
[1:22:42] there was nothing nothing in their
[1:22:45] sensibilities to say that there would be
[1:22:47] anything but but death when they took
[1:22:49] that step nothing to say except the
[1:22:52] commission
[1:22:53] accept the commission amen put on a
[1:22:56] commission amen when you take that step
[1:22:59] amen when you believe that the God that
[1:23:01] was with the prophet amen is tabernacled
[1:23:03] in your Ark amen take that step Don't Be
[1:23:06] Afraid amen because the promise is as I
[1:23:09] was with Moses so I will be with you
[1:23:11] take another step with me amen and I'll
[1:23:14] part the waters you don't have to part
[1:23:16] it you don't have to swim across ow part
[1:23:19] the waters you just believe my word
[1:23:22] amen take that step
[1:23:24] step into that healing step into that
[1:23:27] Deliverance step into that new birth
[1:23:29] don't be afraid to take the step it's
[1:23:31] time for it
[1:23:32] it's a Joshua time
[1:23:35] Hallelujah
[1:23:37] amen you you come into a Jordan
[1:23:39] it's not sooner or later on the way to
[1:23:41] your promise you're coming to a river
[1:23:43] friends but what you've got to realize
[1:23:45] when you come to the river amen that see
[1:23:47] there's something spoken over you that
[1:23:49] don't have anything to do with rivers
[1:23:50] amen because there is an adoption
[1:23:52] message preach amen which says there's a
[1:23:55] mountain in there and it belongs to you
[1:23:56] amen judah's got his Mountain simeon's
[1:23:59] got his Mountain Levi's got his Mountain
[1:24:01] amen but I've got my Mountain amen and I
[1:24:05] know there's a mountain now I don't know
[1:24:06] everything about the rivers I got across
[1:24:08] I don't know everything about The
[1:24:10] Valleys I gotta pass through I don't
[1:24:11] know about the Giants I don't know about
[1:24:13] the strongholds but one thing I know I'm
[1:24:15] gonna stand on my mountain
[1:24:18] amen so when I come to the water I gotta
[1:24:21] step into it
[1:24:22] amen when it come to a dark Valley you
[1:24:25] gotta step into it
[1:24:26] don't be afraid it'll part for you why
[1:24:29] because God promised you something it
[1:24:31] didn't have to do with your
[1:24:32] circumstances it had to do with your
[1:24:34] destiny
[1:24:35] amen
[1:24:37] Hallelujah
[1:24:39] amen it says that commission doesn't
[1:24:41] mention every river the commission
[1:24:42] doesn't talk about every Valley but what
[1:24:44] it says is whatever you run into on the
[1:24:46] way to your Mountain it belongs to you
[1:24:49] it belongs to you it's under your feet
[1:24:51] amen and so it'll be a footstep that'll
[1:24:54] mean possession amen you can stand
[1:24:56] around all day wondering but when you
[1:24:57] take that step God will back it up
[1:25:00] because he promised you a Mountaintop
[1:25:03] Hallelujah actually in Joshua 11 it's
[1:25:06] amazing it says that the Lord hardened
[1:25:07] the hearts of everybody in that land
[1:25:09] those P the children of Israel couldn't
[1:25:11] get no peace in that land because the
[1:25:13] Lord hardened hearts of everybody who
[1:25:15] lived there to come against his people
[1:25:17] say why would God send the enemy against
[1:25:19] his people
[1:25:20] so the enemy could get beat
[1:25:23] so the enemy could get beat
[1:25:25] amen so many times we wonder God why do
[1:25:27] you have me in this Valley
[1:25:29] why do I have to be fighting this fight
[1:25:31] why do why why do I have to be in this

[1:26:29] Hallelujah there it stands Joshua
[1:26:31] looking at Jericho and Joshua was

[1:26:44] taken the walls have never been breached
[1:26:46] and there he's standing there looking
[1:26:48] and wondering and thinking about Jericho
[1:26:49] and all of a sudden a mighty Angel
[1:26:51] appears to him amen the captain of a
[1:26:54] Salvation and Joshua was looking at
[1:26:56] Jericho but the Angels looking back at
[1:26:59] him amen the angel wasn't looking at
[1:27:01] Jericho the angel was looking to Joshua
[1:27:04] and he's saying Joshua what's laying in
[1:27:06] front of you it's already behind me
[1:27:09] I'm not looking at the obstacle I'm

[1:27:22] mighty Angel amen who came with an
[1:27:23] unsheeted sword of an unsealed book amen
[1:27:27] and he didn't want us just to believe in
[1:27:28] it he wanted us to take that book he
[1:27:30] wanted us to prophesy he wanted to see
[1:27:33] some boldness in the church amen
[1:27:36] Hallelujah some ambition
[1:27:39] it's an ambition brother Nathan brother
[1:27:41] Bram said if I see a church it hasn't
[1:27:42] got high ambition something wrong with
[1:27:44] that church
[1:27:46] something wrong with that church
[1:27:48] of God is built on high ambitions
[1:27:50] amen
[1:27:52] Hallelujah
[1:27:54] amen see the message came to show you
[1:27:56] what belongs to you
[1:27:58] it didn't come to address the battles it
[1:28:02] just said there'd be some it didn't come
[1:28:04] to it didn't come to glorify all the
[1:28:06] hardships that we would go through it's
[1:28:07] actually you that's being glorified by
[1:28:09] the hardships
[1:28:10] amen he's glorifying himself his
[1:28:13] strength is made perfect in what
[1:28:15] in weakness amen
[1:28:17] amen and so there Comes A Time in the
[1:28:19] Christian's life amen where you got to
[1:28:22] just believe what was said about you
[1:28:24] there's something's got to well up on
[1:28:26] the inside now you might be in a cycle
[1:28:28] for years and years like shamgar amen
[1:28:31] and you're in that cycle of you get
[1:28:33] somewhere and the enemy takes it away
[1:28:35] and you get somewhere with God and the
[1:28:37] enemy takes it away but sometime brother
[1:28:39] sister Something's Gotta raise up in the
[1:28:41] heart Amen to say no I gotta stand on
[1:28:44] the promise there's a commission over me
[1:28:46] I don't have to give ground I can take a
[1:28:50] step and God will back it up amen
[1:28:52] amen you gotta strike the water you
[1:28:55] gotta strike the water look at Elisha
[1:28:57] who represents the bride is that right
[1:28:58] and Elisha amen went through an
[1:29:01] experience that matches exactly what
[1:29:02] we've had around the message amen where
[1:29:04] he walks with a prophet he looks to a
[1:29:07] prophet he's called and commissioned by
[1:29:08] a prophet amen and he loves that
[1:29:10] prophet's Ministry he's drawing from
[1:29:12] that Ministry and all of a sudden God
[1:29:13] takes that Prophet off the scene
[1:29:15] amen and Elisha acts like any human
[1:29:17] being would act and he goes through a
[1:29:20] period of time he's just in mourning
[1:29:22] you don't see any power you don't see
[1:29:23] any Miracles you don't see any ambition
[1:29:25] all you see is wishing amen and he's
[1:29:28] crying out saying oh my father my father
[1:29:30] the Chariots of Israel the horsemen God
[1:29:32] why could why did you take the prophet
[1:29:34] why would you take your message off the
[1:29:37] Earth and not realizing he hadn't and
[1:29:39] friends we've had a long time around the
[1:29:41] message amen of of of of wondering of
[1:29:45] trying to figure out amen of saying what
[1:29:47] did Elijah tell us anyway amen what what
[1:29:50] was in that message anyway besides
[1:29:52] hunting stories and testimonies from 60
[1:29:55] years ago and and and lifetime
[1:29:57] experiences and all those things which
[1:29:58] are wonderful amen but they don't don't
[1:30:00] do much to hold an individual today amen
[1:30:03] as far as their spiritual ceiling amen
[1:30:05] but then Elisha something begins to grow
[1:30:07] in his heart it begins to think about
[1:30:08] what Elijah's told him and Elijah was
[1:30:11] saying things about double portions it
[1:30:13] was saying things about the supernatural
[1:30:14] he was saying things about an Elisha
[1:30:17] Ministry amen sooner or later Elisha
[1:30:19] sooner or later Brad we gotta take this
[1:30:22] mantle up amen and don't be afraid
[1:30:24] strike the water and you can expect that
[1:30:27] the Lord God of Elijah will be the same
[1:30:29] God today
[1:30:31] you got to take on that mantle brother
[1:30:33] random told you he said their mantle of
[1:30:35] a doctor that the power amen The
[1:30:37] Authority the government would be on his
[1:30:39] shoulders
[1:30:41] amen and the shoulders not the head the
[1:30:44] shoulder's not the eye of the Seer it's
[1:30:46] a body amen and how many believe in a
[1:30:48] body Ministry how many believe the god
[1:30:51] of William Brown's the God today
[1:30:53] still does the supernatural amen you of
[1:30:55] all people I know you agree with me amen
[1:30:59] that we will see Miracles we have seen
[1:31:01] Miracles amen God is God is real his
[1:31:05] promises are true
[1:31:07] Hallelujah a body Ministry brother Bram
[1:31:10] said that's where the real Church speaks
[1:31:12] in his power that's where the apostolic
[1:31:15] power returns to the church when the
[1:31:17] government shall be upon his shoulders
[1:31:19] he said there's come in a real Church
[1:31:21] there's coming a real church I say
[1:31:23] there's never been a day like this day I
[1:31:26] believe in that this is just me and uh
[1:31:29] and and you can go with me if you want
[1:31:30] to amen but I believe this day this
[1:31:33] quote is fulfilled amen that there is a
[1:31:36] church on the face of the Earth that
[1:31:37] understands amen not only what God has
[1:31:40] done but understands what God is doing
[1:31:42] understand that she has a position
[1:31:44] understand she has Authority understand
[1:31:46] she has power brother Branham called you
[1:31:49] the Queen of Heaven amen it's time to
[1:31:51] exercise your rights time to exercise
[1:31:54] your Authority your power
[1:31:56] you're Royal you're a royal seed amen
[1:31:59] it's a promised day amen but see it's
[1:32:02] got to be by a real Revelation I want
[1:32:04] you to notice when Joshua amen Joshua in
[1:32:07] in Deuteronomy 31 he's commissioned by
[1:32:09] Moses he actually hears the commission
[1:32:11] you know not out of the sky but it comes
[1:32:13] from Moses it's Moses his own voice
[1:32:15] calls him in Deuteronomy 31 and says
[1:32:17] Joshua come here he says be strong in a
[1:32:19] good courage because I because you've
[1:32:21] been chosen to lead the people into the
[1:32:23] land and you're going to be the
[1:32:24] fulfiller of it amen and so what a
[1:32:27] wonderful thing that would have been a
[1:32:28] good day to be in church when Moses
[1:32:30] prophesied that over Joshua I would have
[1:32:33] liked to been there amen but see when
[1:32:36] Joshua when we come to Joshua chapter 1
[1:32:38] it doesn't say Moses said it doesn't say
[1:32:41] brother branham's head but it says these
[1:32:43] words the Lord spake unto Joshua and
[1:32:47] brother sister until this message
[1:32:48] becomes more amen than mechanical words
[1:32:51] on a tank it's got to be the voice of
[1:32:54] God speaking to you amen commissioning
[1:32:56] you for a work today amen by a divine
[1:32:59] revelation that's what it takes not an
[1:33:02] intellectual conception not a bunch of
[1:33:04] dry theology God didn't send a message
[1:33:06] to make you a a Pentecostal with
[1:33:09] slightly better Doctrine he didn't send
[1:33:10] it to make you a Baptist with slightly
[1:33:12] Freer worship amen but he sent you a
[1:33:15] word amen a perfect word amen to put you
[1:33:19] on a Capstone position of power
[1:33:24] amen and the Holy Ghost is here to
[1:33:27] reveal it that it's to you
[1:33:30] it's your calling it's your commission
[1:33:33] it's your message
[1:33:35] just amen but one of these days
[1:33:37] shouldn't we ought to believe it
[1:33:40] Allelujah amen it wasn't the voice of
[1:33:42] Moses it was the voice of God Amen
[1:33:45] that's what happens when you flip on a
[1:33:46] tape you say rapturing faith lays on the
[1:33:48] tapes if I say it's got to come off
[1:33:49] sometime and get into the heart of a of
[1:33:52] a Rapture people amen bird will produce
[1:33:55] Resurrection Life resurrection power
[1:33:57] quickening power
[1:34:00] amen that's what we're living in you
[1:34:02] won't do that and under your under this
[1:34:04] human nature under this first birth
[1:34:06] Joshua couldn't either
[1:34:08] when Joshua was born his mama named him
[1:34:10] Hosea it's a beautiful name it means it
[1:34:13] means savior
[1:34:15] savior even even from birth there was an
[1:34:18] expectation that was put on Joshua to be
[1:34:20] a child of Destiny he was Moses's
[1:34:22] right-hand man he had a position of
[1:34:24] authority people looked to him he was a
[1:34:26] heroic figure even then but he couldn't
[1:34:28] take one into land like that amen but
[1:34:32] actually under the ministry of Moses
[1:34:33] Joshua had to have an experience and you
[1:34:35] got to have the same experience and
[1:34:37] every one of our young people have got
[1:34:38] to have the same experience amen when
[1:34:40] Moses calls him forth he says Joshua
[1:34:42] your name's not hoshea anymore but
[1:34:45] you're yeah
[1:34:46] amen which is not just a savior but it's
[1:34:49] God the Savior and what he did was he
[1:34:52] took a Divine element He took it he took
[1:34:55] part of his own God took part of his own
[1:34:57] nature his own identity his own name and
[1:35:01] he put it into Joshua's character and
[1:35:03] that overwrote all the weakness of his
[1:35:06] first birth amen Joshua never could have
[1:35:08] been a savior but by the Divine element
[1:35:10] brother sister and how could you ever
[1:35:12] take a Rapture I'll tell you how by a
[1:35:15] divine element we are partakers of the
[1:35:19] divine nature and God Amen has ruled out
[1:35:22] the Dynamics of the Holy Spirit poured
[1:35:25] it into this church amen to Quicken Amen
[1:35:28] to purge you of all of your first birth
[1:35:30] he said I don't call you a church
[1:35:31] anymore I call you bride you are sinless
[1:35:34] you are spotless it's just as if you
[1:35:37] never did it in the first place
[1:35:39] hallelujah amen don't look at your
[1:35:42] nature anymore don't look at your name
[1:35:45] don't look at your background it ain't
[1:35:47] about what kind of a family you came out
[1:35:49] of amen amen what kind of family did you
[1:35:51] come out of brother Ron real high noble
[1:35:54] people
[1:35:55] real intellectual
[1:35:57] real wealthy real famous amen don't look
[1:36:00] at that amen but the Divine element
[1:36:03] purges that amen amen his nature washes
[1:36:08] our old man away amen and we're
[1:36:11] translated into the kingdom of his dear
[1:36:13] son
[1:36:14] all things are passed away all things
[1:36:16] are become new
[1:36:17] hallelujah amen and one one day you see
[1:36:20] you see a weakling you see amen one day
[1:36:23] you see a Christian just struggling
[1:36:25] caught in this cycle amen but bye that
[1:36:27] Divine element
[1:36:29] amen a sinner becomes a saint a weakling
[1:36:32] a Stripling becomes a champion amen a
[1:36:35] little boy becomes a giant slayer
[1:36:37] Hallelujah by the Divine element friends
[1:36:39] that's what we're trusting in it's the
[1:36:41] Divine element that will cause you to
[1:36:42] give a good report amen because once you
[1:36:44] receive that Divine element you'll look
[1:36:46] at a giant you'll call it a grasshopper
[1:36:47] you look at a mountain you call it a
[1:36:49] molehill not cause you got the power to
[1:36:51] overcome it but because there's a Divine
[1:36:53] element
[1:36:54] something on the inside that says I'm
[1:36:57] able
[1:36:58] I'm called I'm commissioned for this
[1:37:01] brother Bram said the only way you
[1:37:02] overcome is by Holy Ghost baptism all
[1:37:05] that's under the shed blood is
[1:37:06] Overcomers because you can't overcome
[1:37:08] yourself
[1:37:10] but it's he that overcome for you amen
[1:37:13] what are you and I friends we're just a
[1:37:15] little Rahab amen who had no power to
[1:37:17] save herself she didn't come from
[1:37:19] anything special there was nothing about
[1:37:21] her amen that that would cause anybody
[1:37:23] to to look with admiration or or honor
[1:37:26] amen but she had one thing a token amen
[1:37:29] and the token and Joshua loved the token
[1:37:31] because the token is what allowed Joshua
[1:37:34] to be a savior it's one of all friends
[1:37:36] amen you and I have got a token amen
[1:37:40] it's not by might it's not by power but
[1:37:43] it's by an identification amen when I
[1:37:45] see the blood over you amen I won't let
[1:37:48] judgment pass over you I've already
[1:37:51] accepted you
[1:37:53] you can't do it yourself see that's the
[1:37:55] problem many times in a Christian Life
[1:37:57] say brother Nathan I need save from this
[1:37:59] I need save from that all right who's
[1:38:02] doing the saving
[1:38:03] who's doing the saving Hosea he's saying

[1:38:09] bride and I'm supposed to be in that
[1:38:11] Invincible Army and I'm supposed to live
[1:38:13] so high the devil doesn't know what to
[1:38:14] do with me and amen that's all great
[1:38:17] amen but who's doing the saving amen

[1:38:39] we're more than able to take the land
[1:38:42] I say with God we're more than able to
[1:38:44] do you say brother Nathan after all
[1:38:45] these years you really think the message
[1:38:46] is going to survive think the churches
[1:38:48] are going to hold together you think the
[1:38:50] Revival is going to go on you think
[1:38:51] there's any hope for the for the for the
[1:38:53] new generation I got more hope now than
[1:38:55] I've ever had I'm more excited now this
[1:38:57] is the the depths of my heart brother's
[1:38:59] sister I'm more excited about what God's
[1:39:02] doing right now than I've ever been in
[1:39:04] my life amen cause I see the commission
[1:39:07] I'm not looking at the circumstances
[1:39:10] hey man why I've been listening to some
[1:39:12] calebs I I don't we appreciate a Caleb
[1:39:15] Ministry
[1:39:16] amen somebody who stayed true over over
[1:39:19] many years and held their heads above
[1:39:21] Winds of Doctrine and amen men that
[1:39:23] never looked at the circumstances they
[1:39:25] just looked at the promise and I thank
[1:39:27] God for brother Ron I believe he's a
[1:39:29] Caleb amen I've been raised up under a
[1:39:31] Caleb Ministry that type of ministry
[1:39:33] Brother Ray amen stay true to the
[1:39:36] message didn't try to insert himself
[1:39:37] into it just believed it just expected
[1:39:40] it to manifest itself didn't look at all
[1:39:43] the nonsense didn't get embroiled up in
[1:39:44] all the and all those things I say thank
[1:39:46] God for a Caleb amen when you find a
[1:39:49] real Caleb you stay with that guy he's
[1:39:51] gonna put you on your Mountain
[1:39:53] he's gonna put you on your Mountain
[1:39:55] and just time you think he's done he
[1:39:57] ain't done until we're all on our
[1:39:59] Mountain
[1:40:01] yes sir
[1:40:03] amen yours last
[1:40:05] Hallelujah
[1:40:06] that's scriptural amen amen you see I
[1:40:09] find that God had to raise up a Caleb he
[1:40:11] couldn't let a bunch of young guys go
[1:40:12] running into the land Helter Skelter
[1:40:14] he'd had to have a Caleb there
[1:40:16] Amen to lead the charge amen and Caleb
[1:40:19] the great thing about Caleb Caleb
[1:40:21] doesn't diminish in power he only grows
[1:40:22] in power why because he's not looking at
[1:40:24] the natural things he's looking at the
[1:40:26] promise and brother sister the longer
[1:40:28] you look at the promise the stronger you
[1:40:30] get amen the more able you be you are
[1:40:33] amen we're not getting weaker Church the
[1:40:36] message isn't getting weaker just look
[1:40:37] at it amen just quote it just believe it
[1:40:40] don't worry about what everybody else
[1:40:41] says amen takes a Caleb Caleb says give
[1:40:44] me my Mountain that's a bride mentality
[1:40:46] that's a bride mentality a Mountain's
[1:40:49] not an easy place to live amen but but
[1:40:51] it's hard to live up on that Capstone
[1:40:53] level it'd be easy to be down here on
[1:40:55] simple faith and maybe a little virtue
[1:40:58] maybe a little or or some people hit
[1:41:01] knowledge and they never got any farther
[1:41:03] amen but Caleb said no he said I don't
[1:41:05] want a valley
[1:41:06] put me on a mountain
[1:41:09] there's a mountain with my name on it I
[1:41:10] wonder you know Caleb was a real Warrior
[1:41:12] and I was just thinking about this and
[1:41:13] you could take it for what it's worth
[1:41:15] but I wonder if Caleb being a man just
[1:41:18] born for the battle he's a real Warrior
[1:41:20] he he might have known something he
[1:41:22] might have seen something down through
[1:41:23] history you could you look at history
[1:41:24] and there was this great you know great
[1:41:27] region of of of of prosperity and
[1:41:30] fertility down there and at the Tigris
[1:41:32] and the Euphrates down in that Sumerian
[1:41:34] value right and and out of that Valley
[1:41:36] came this big Empire of Sumerians and
[1:41:38] they live right on the river and
[1:41:39] everything came easy and it grew just
[1:41:41] naturally and everything was great and

[1:45:14] brother Bram said this and this is just
[1:45:16] quite an amazing and again I'm just
[1:45:18] thinking about this Young Generation

[1:45:21] heart is and passion of my Ministry but
[1:45:24] here's Caleb and Joshua saying we're
[1:45:25] more than able to do it is this all
[1:45:27] right tonight amen we're more than able
[1:45:30] to do it why he said because they were
[1:45:32] looking at God's promise not what the
[1:45:33] circumstances but then there's all the
[1:45:35] old Fighters all the old Fighters right
[1:45:37] amen uh many and now brother bran said
[1:45:41] something that chills me to the Bone
[1:45:43] about the old Fighters he said did God
[1:45:45] bless them
[1:45:47] sure
[1:45:49] boy that shook me
[1:45:51] he blessed them they wandered about
[1:45:54] they married wives they planted
[1:45:57] Vineyards they had babies
[1:45:59] and they increased they'd done good in
[1:46:01] the wilderness
[1:46:03] amen they done good but they weren't in
[1:46:06] full blessing
[1:46:08] brother sister I don't plan
[1:46:10] I'm spending 50 60 years of my life
[1:46:13] wandering around in this message just to
[1:46:15] get married and have babies and build a
[1:46:18] church and a career I want to live in
[1:46:20] full blessing
[1:46:22] I'm tired of the nonsense tired of the
[1:46:25] politics amen but God I'm I want to get
[1:46:28] behind my Caleb and I want to go into
[1:46:30] this thing and see what's laying there
[1:46:32] for me
[1:46:35] I want to see the fullness of it I want
[1:46:37] to experience the riches of it I want
[1:46:39] the reality of it I want to see the
[1:46:41] supernatural I want to see Revival

[1:46:55] want to eat that honey
[1:46:57] I want to live in full blessing that's a
[1:46:59] very Cry of my heart brother sister it
[1:47:01] is so easy to settle for just a simple
[1:47:05] Christian Life as a church member
[1:47:07] joining a social group associating
[1:47:09] yourself with the message amen amen but
[1:47:12] you're not saved by calling yourself a
[1:47:14] message believer
[1:47:15] the token's not over you because you've
[1:47:17] got the picture of the Prophet on your
[1:47:19] wall
[1:47:20] there's one name given under Heaven
[1:47:22] whereby men may be saved
[1:47:28] you got to be born into that name
[1:47:31] or you'll never live in full blessing
[1:47:33] you'll have a nice life you'll have a
[1:47:34] nice wife you'll have nice children good
[1:47:36] Fellowship Good Times
[1:47:38] but I want to live in full blessing
[1:47:41] and I believe there's a people on the
[1:47:42] earth now that it's a very Cry of their
[1:47:44] heart
[1:47:47] put me on that mountain
[1:47:50] the giant somebody else failed to kill
[1:47:53] give me a chance
[1:47:55] that stronghold that's never been torn
[1:47:57] down it's time
[1:47:59] amen put me on my mountain
[1:48:01] I'm in the Valley of the shadow of death
[1:48:03] but I'm on my way to a Mountaintop
[1:48:07] Hallelujah I want to live in full
[1:48:10] blessing
[1:48:12] I want to live a full blessing
[1:48:14] Hallelujah amazing actually Moses tells
[1:48:18] them he says he talks about the old
[1:48:19] Fighters none of them went in but he
[1:48:22] said listen he said your little ones
[1:48:24] your little ones and which you said
[1:48:27] would be a prey
[1:48:28] you said they'd be a prey but then will
[1:48:31] I bring in and they shall know the land
[1:48:33] which you have despised I just got to
[1:48:36] think about that brother Andrew amen
[1:48:38] that we had people you know that there
[1:48:40] were people the Lord was supposed to
[1:48:41] come in 1977. we weren't supposed to be
[1:48:44] here
[1:48:45] and some of you old enough to remember
[1:48:47] the Perugia Doctrine going around saying
[1:48:49] well he came off The Mercy Seat in 1963
[1:48:51] and none of our children are going to be
[1:48:52] able to be saved and all those things
[1:48:54] amen that's what the old Fighters were
[1:48:56] talking about
[1:48:57] amen we weren't supposed to be here and
[1:49:00] these young people weren't supposed to
[1:49:01] be here hallelujah amen but God's raised
[1:49:05] up a generation Against All Odds
[1:49:08] Hallelujah by his own hand he's formed
[1:49:11] up the greatest generation of young
[1:49:13] believers that's ever lived
[1:49:16] and they're gonna sweep this message on
[1:49:18] to the coming of the Lord
[1:49:23] I'll be the first one to testify this
[1:49:25] generation has a quality My Generation
[1:49:27] didn't have amen but why because this
[1:49:30] message doesn't go like this amen it
[1:49:32] goes like this amen God is elevating the
[1:49:35] thing don't you get discouraged if
[1:49:37] you're looking for negativity there's
[1:49:38] plenty to be found but if you just look
[1:49:41] right in front of your nose you see what
[1:49:43] God is doing amen the bride's Revival's
[1:49:45] in full swing amen with full power with
[1:49:49] full benefits
[1:49:51] thank you
[1:49:54] there's a supernatural being
[1:49:58] leading each one into their positional
[1:50:00] placing until we come to the fullness of
[1:50:03] adoption which is a very changing of
[1:50:06] this body
[1:50:08] we weren't supposed to be here I just
[1:50:09] love that you know David David was
[1:50:11] supposed to be the one
[1:50:13] David had on his heart it was his vision
[1:50:16] it was his desire to see the house of
[1:50:19] God's worship restored he believed in a
[1:50:22] message of restoration he believed in
[1:50:24] the work it was his cause he he wanted
[1:50:27] it amen he wanted to produce it but
[1:50:30] there were blood on his hands
[1:50:32] there was blood on his hands so what
[1:50:34] does he do he turns to a new generation
[1:50:35] amen he says Solomon he said and he
[1:50:39] gives him the Joshua commission he says
[1:50:41] Solomon be strong and of a good courage
[1:50:44] amen for the Lord has selected you to
[1:50:47] prepare him house hallelujah amen we've
[1:50:50] had a lot of old Fighters there's a lot
[1:50:52] of people amen a lot of men piled up on
[1:50:54] the scrap heaps and things a lot of
[1:50:56] blood that has been shed brother sister
[1:50:58] but don't you lose hope amen there are
[1:51:01] greater than Solomon is still here amen
[1:51:04] and he has restored himself a body
[1:51:06] Temple amen we're his people amen can
[1:51:09] get together and not just talk about God
[1:51:11] and again the things that he did
[1:51:13] historically amen but they can
[1:51:16] experience the atmosphere and the power
[1:51:19] and the reality of the Shekinah glory
[1:51:22] amen why because the greater than
[1:51:24] Solomon raised up to restore a house of
[1:51:26] worship
[1:51:28] that's what this message is friends it's
[1:51:30] a restored worship amen it's a restored
[1:51:33] belief with restored power and restored

[1:52:06] don't remember that in the Book of
[1:52:07] Joshua it was there

[1:52:12] amen so maybe not everybody saw it
[1:52:15] maybe not everybody witnessed it with
[1:52:17] their own physical eyes
[1:52:19] but they saw the power of it
[1:52:21] amen and the ones that believed in it
[1:52:23] when it moved you better believe they
[1:52:24] moved with it they weren't going to stay
[1:52:26] behind in the wilderness amen when that
[1:52:28] thing hit the Jordan they were right

[1:52:52] wood of your humanity and he covered it
[1:52:54] with his deity he poured out the gold of
[1:52:58] his own self onto the bride
[1:53:00] Amen to make you the Tabernacle of his

[1:54:23] generation amen this message is not to
[1:54:27] just be talked about
[1:54:29] he didn't send a message so we could
[1:54:30] stand out in the parking lot and swap
[1:54:32] quotes and blow somebody's mind and
[1:54:33] prove how spiritual we are this message
[1:54:35] is supposed to be believed

[1:55:11] get up and move
[1:55:13] or be to God

[1:55:18] Overcomers are moving with it
[1:55:20] amen he said kanan's not the Millennium
[1:55:23] it's the age of the Overcomer oh the
[1:55:26] dispensation of overcoming Hallelujah
[1:55:28] now what's the land that's promised to
[1:55:30] the believer the promise is the Holy
[1:55:32] Spirit
[1:55:33] and how do you find that your position
[1:55:35] in that land
[1:55:37] you got to be born for it
[1:55:39] you got to be born for it my goodness I
[1:55:41] gotta hurry amen but you've got to be
[1:55:43] born for this now all these all these
[1:55:45] overcoming children of Israel amen they
[1:55:49] they were born under a name that that
[1:55:52] predestined them amen that foreign them
[1:55:55] to possess a place in that land isn't
[1:55:57] that right when the sons of Israel were
[1:55:59] born their mother was preaching birth
[1:56:00] pains
[1:56:01] amen and in that wonderful message of
[1:56:04] birth pains she's calling names over
[1:56:06] these children amen and there was Judah
[1:56:08] and there was Simeon and there were all
[1:56:09] these all these all these sons and that
[1:56:12] name that they were born under friends
[1:56:14] amen see first of all you got to have a
[1:56:16] birth
[1:56:17] but then you've got to realize what that
[1:56:18] birth means amen when you're born you're
[1:56:21] born under Renee and the name doesn't
[1:56:24] have anything now they might have been
[1:56:25] down in Egypt when they were born but
[1:56:27] the name that didn't have anything to do
[1:56:29] with their Egyptian condition amen and
[1:56:31] they might have been wandering in the
[1:56:32] wilderness but that name wasn't talking
[1:56:34] about the Wilderness but at the time of
[1:56:37] birth amen there was a name given over
[1:56:39] them that said it don't matter where you
[1:56:41] came from it doesn't matter what kind of
[1:56:43] circumstances you're in you were born
[1:56:46] for something more there's a mountain
[1:56:49] somewhere with your name on it
[1:56:51] glory to God friends your destiny was
[1:56:54] spoken over you at your birth the Bible
[1:56:56] says we are predestinated unto adoption
[1:57:00] now are we the sons of God but there's a
[1:57:03] mountain
[1:57:04] amen there's a positional placing
[1:57:06] there's a Rapture waiting for you
[1:57:08] that's what the token tells you amen
[1:57:10] that's why you can rest under this token
[1:57:12] amen because it because that token amen
[1:57:15] God didn't put a token over them just to
[1:57:17] say well they'll they'll do well in
[1:57:19] Egypt and they'll get by he put a token
[1:57:21] over them because he said they'll never
[1:57:23] fall under Egyptian Dominion because
[1:57:25] I've already got a land in mine I've got
[1:57:28] a place I want to take him to oh my I
[1:57:30] wish I had time to preach Hallelujah
[1:57:33] amen the spirit Bears witness with our
[1:57:36] spirit that we are the sons of God Amen
[1:57:38] that's that that that is the message
[1:57:41] we've received a message of adoption
[1:57:44] which has given us the power and the
[1:57:46] right and the authority to be what God
[1:57:49] said we would be
[1:57:51] amen what amen we're in the final work
[1:57:54] of redemption in the doesn't the Bible
[1:57:57] talk about a great valley
[1:57:59] and it's got there he one of the Prophet
[1:58:01] saw a great big valley and there was a
[1:58:03] huge Army in it
[1:58:04] but it was bones
[1:58:06] dry and dead so what does he do he
[1:58:09] commands the prophet he says Pro send
[1:58:11] forth a prophecy send him three works of
[1:58:14] redemption he said he said he and so
[1:58:17] Ezekiel prophesies and what happens a
[1:58:19] message of justification comes over
[1:58:20] those bones and sinew begins to grow on
[1:58:22] those Dry Bones then comes a message of
[1:58:25] sanctification amen and and flesh wraps
[1:58:28] around the sinew amen and then he sends
[1:58:30] a restoration the gifts and the baptism
[1:58:32] the Holy Ghost off of Azusa Street and
[1:58:34] skin covers it over amen like the
[1:58:36] shelter of those Pentecostal leaves and
[1:58:37] amen everything's great you got a valley
[1:58:39] full of strong men with restored bodies
[1:58:42] and amen and and a strong looking mighty
[1:58:46] looking Army but they're dead and they
[1:58:48] don't have the power Amen to possess
[1:58:51] what they were raised up to possess so
[1:58:53] what does God do amen he says Ezekiel
[1:58:56] prophesy one more time
[1:58:58] amen send another prophecy over the
[1:59:01] people amen and when he did God filled
[1:59:04] up his lungs with the Eastern wind amen
[1:59:06] and he breathed and he breathed into
[1:59:08] those bodies and they rose up Amen to be
[1:59:12] an invincible Army friends what this
[1:59:14] message is is the very Breath of God
[1:59:16] Amen to fill your lungs amen with life
[1:59:20] amen to turn an old Baptist or Methodist
[1:59:22] or Pentecostal into a living breathing
[1:59:24] Invincible overcoming Army of conquests
[1:59:28] Hallelujah the Bible says the breath
[1:59:30] came into them and they lived and stood
[1:59:32] upon their feet in exceeding great Army
[1:59:34] and he said I have opened up your Graves
[1:59:37] amen he's about to preach him an
[1:59:39] adoption message he says and I shall put
[1:59:41] my spirit in you and you shall live and
[1:59:44] I'll place you in your own land
[1:59:48] brother sister I say let this prophet's
[1:59:51] message breathe life into you
[1:59:53] let it breathe life into you let it not
[1:59:56] just be the words of a man but God
[1:59:58] himself speak into your heart and
[2:00:00] breathing it into you the same way that
[2:00:03] that God breathed life in Adam the same
[2:00:06] way that Jesus breathed the Holy Ghost
[2:00:08] over the disciples Amen Let it breathe
[2:00:11] on you
[2:00:12] let the Breath of God fill your lungs
[2:00:15] amen amen we see our wayward children we
[2:00:18] see backsliders and we see prodigals
[2:00:21] amen and the situation looks impossible
[2:00:23] amen but there was a mother one time who
[2:00:25] knew about an Elijah Ministry where even
[2:00:28] when things looked impossible when it
[2:00:29] looked like it was past hope she knew a
[2:00:31] prophet had been in the land and if she
[2:00:34] could get her boy under that influence
[2:00:36] that Prophet amen could lay over that
[2:00:38] boy and breathe life back into a dead
[2:00:40] man
[2:00:42] amen there's a breath of life in this
[2:00:44] message
[2:00:45] Amen Let it breathe over you Hallelujah
[2:00:48] Moses comes to the Red Sea and there he
[2:00:51] is you know you know and on one side
[2:00:53] amen he's got the there's these wild
[2:00:56] crashing waves of fanaticism and on the
[2:01:00] other side is these stinking stagnant
[2:01:02] Waters of formalism and and Pharaoh
[2:01:05] didn't care which side they drowned in
[2:01:06] as long as he got him off amen he wanted
[2:01:09] to he wanted to run him into one or the
[2:01:10] other friends amen but what did do god
[2:01:12] do amen God took a great big breath of
[2:01:15] air and he breathed out that East Wind
[2:01:17] and it opened up a narrow way right down
[2:01:19] the middle brother sister between
[2:01:21] formalism and fanaticism amen I you say
[2:01:24] brother Nathan you afraid of getting off
[2:01:25] are you afraid this message is going to
[2:01:27] spin off this way or spin off that way
[2:01:28] I'm not afraid of amen cause I
[2:01:31] feel the Breath of God Amen I feel the
[2:01:34] Eastern wind blowing out of this message
[2:01:37] amen I hear my theophany whispering to
[2:01:40] me
[2:01:40] saying you step into that water and
[2:01:43] you'll walk through on dry ground
[2:01:45] and you'll go places where Satan can't
[2:01:47] follow you
[2:01:49] let it breathe on you let it fill your
[2:01:52] lungs amen amen it's hard to stand on a
[2:01:55] mountain some mountains are so high you
[2:01:57] don't even have the breath in yourself
[2:01:58] to stand there so what do you need you
[2:02:00] need an air supply and brother I I know
[2:02:03] this is simple preaching but the
[2:02:05] greatest Air Supply I know amen is the
[2:02:08] message of the hour amen when God told
[2:02:10] William Branham to prophesy again over a
[2:02:12] dead bunch of churches amen and when he
[2:02:15] prophesied God breathed life into the
[2:02:17] Bride of Jesus Christ and he said I've
[2:02:19] made you more than a conqueror you're an
[2:02:22] invincible Army and I'm going to put you
[2:02:23] in your adoption
[2:02:25] you're going to take a Rapture
[2:02:27] hallelujah hallelujah you got to breathe
[2:02:30] it you got to believe it I'm very near
[2:02:33] to close but oh think of it friends as I
[2:02:36] was with Moses so I will be with thee
[2:02:38] amen that he's still breathing over you
[2:02:41] he's still blowing on the waters to make
[2:02:44] a oh hit when the waters are troubled
[2:02:45] friends it's not just a rushing Mighty
[2:02:47] Wind but it's a breath of God pardon
[2:02:50] your obstacle parting your part pardon
[2:02:52] your your destruction and making a way
[2:02:54] for you to walk through it
[2:02:56] Hallelujah
[2:02:57] step into that water breathe that word
[2:03:00] climb out of that Valley

[2:03:09] message air amen I'm breathe into that
[2:03:12] trumpet blow it for all it's worth
[2:03:15] amen he has no voice
[2:03:18] but our voice
[2:03:21] you say you say brother Nathan I'd love
[2:03:23] to know I'd love to know a living
[2:03:25] breathing God
[2:03:27] amen I know where he's at
[2:03:30] he has no voice but your voice he has no
[2:03:34] hands but your hands he's got no breath
[2:03:38] but your breath
[2:03:41] Hallelujah he said if you abide in me
[2:03:43] and my words abide in you ask what you
[2:03:45] will
[2:03:46] it'll be given you
[2:03:49] amen see your commission to do it that's
[2:03:51] why Joshua under a commission it didn't
[2:03:53] matter what he ran into it didn't matter
[2:03:55] how impossible the situation that's why
[2:03:57] Joshua could stand there amen and in his
[2:04:00] in a dark hour in a in a heavy battle
[2:04:02] amen when he needed a little more light
[2:04:05] what did he do he spoke to the sun now
[2:04:07] you talk about now you talk about
[2:04:10] you talk about arrogance amen you talk
[2:04:13] about ambition amen when Joshua stand
[2:04:16] there and square his shoulders back say
[2:04:18] son stand still Right Where You Are
[2:04:20] amen sounds ridiculous amen but see
[2:04:23] there was a commission amen and so see
[2:04:26] here when you think about the scenario
[2:04:28] amen how perfectly it matches our day
[2:04:30] when Joshua was standing there right
[2:04:32] there at the evening time when it was
[2:04:33] getting really really dark and he's in a
[2:04:35] and he's in a battle just a pitch battle
[2:04:37] amen they're going all out fighting this
[2:04:40] war amen and Joshua's standing there and
[2:04:42] he needs just a little more light to
[2:04:44] overcome amen now if Moses was there
[2:04:46] Moses would have lifted his arms and
[2:04:48] everything would have been okay amen but
[2:04:49] Moses wasn't there with Joshua it was
[2:04:52] Joshua standing there fighting that
[2:04:53] battle so where did he find the light to
[2:04:55] overcome in the inside voice in the
[2:04:59] inside voice because Moses had breathed
[2:05:01] some things over Joshua and Joshua took
[2:05:04] it in and when he stood there he didn't
[2:05:06] lift His Hands to Heaven say God send
[2:05:08] Moses back no he knew there was a
[2:05:10] commission over him amen so he stood
[2:05:13] there no matter how ridiculous it looked
[2:05:15] and he ordered the sun to stand still
[2:05:18] hallelujah amen how could he do it he
[2:05:21] was commissioned to do it amen the
[2:05:24] inside voice just like brother Branham
[2:05:27] amen when he preached about the third
[2:05:28] poll he said there he was sitting in the
[2:05:30] woods and something inside an inside
[2:05:33] voice speaks to him he said not an
[2:05:34] audible but something inside said hey
[2:05:36] you know he'd already spoke to squirrels
[2:05:38] he'd already seen a lot of Supernatural
[2:05:40] enough that you and I might have packed
[2:05:42] up our bags and went home said let's
[2:05:43] call it a day
[2:05:44] let's quit while we're ahead
[2:05:47] amen but the inside voice
[2:05:49] said wait a minute
[2:05:51] you asked for three
[2:05:54] you asked for three
[2:05:58] amen
[2:05:59] amen you you've been through Falls
[2:06:01] you've been through fires but you asked
[2:06:03] for three
[2:06:04] amen any and and and and there in that
[2:06:08] moment he says okay
[2:06:09] I love the way the bread brand says it
[2:06:11] he says I'll make this one ridiculous
[2:06:16] I'll make this one ridiculous and he
[2:06:18] said there's going to be a squirrel he's
[2:06:19] going to pop out here he's gonna he's
[2:06:21] gonna run down and out on the branch and
[2:06:22] look over at that farmer he'll look back
[2:06:23] at me and I'll shoot it amen it didn't
[2:06:25] happen right away
[2:06:27] hey man you can't always get in a hurry
[2:06:28] with God but trust that Commission
[2:06:31] trust that Divine elements oh he sits
[2:06:33] there and he gives to God a little time
[2:06:35] to move all of a sudden what happens the
[2:06:36] squirrel pops up runs down the tree runs
[2:06:38] out the branch looks at the farmer looks
[2:06:40] back and he shoots it I say there's
[2:06:42] nothing too ridiculous for a third pole
[2:06:44] Church
[2:06:46] but if you say to this mountain
[2:06:48] be thou mood and cast into the sea
[2:06:51] you'll have what you asked for
[2:06:53] God breathes something into you but you
[2:06:56] gotta breathe it back it'll be your
[2:06:58] mountain and your voice
[2:07:01] amen and when that inside voice turns Up
[2:07:03] In You amen and that that and that
[2:07:06] courage that boldness begins to rise
[2:07:08] amen then don't look at the sun don't
[2:07:10] look at the Moon don't look at the
[2:07:12] doctor's report don't look at the
[2:07:14] circumstances
[2:07:16] trust that commission and speak
[2:07:18] speak the word of God
[2:07:21] Hallelujah
[2:07:22] amen the Bible says there never was a
[2:07:24] day before it or after I say until now
[2:07:27] that the Lord hearken until the voice of
[2:07:29] a man
[2:07:31] I say there's never been a day like this
[2:07:33] day
[2:07:33] God sent a message came down with a
[2:07:35] third pole Ministry and he handed a book
[2:07:37] out cracked wide open gave it to the
[2:07:40] Bride of Jesus Christ
[2:07:42] he said once you're done eating it and
[2:07:44] then you get through all that bitterness
[2:07:45] of of half an address holy and having to
[2:07:48] give up your old habits and having to
[2:07:51] leave you you know leave that
[2:07:52] denominational church and once you get
[2:07:53] through all that bitterness that honey
[2:07:56] that Canaanite honey amen's gonna settle
[2:07:59] way down in there something's gonna
[2:08:01] happen to you little bride there's going
[2:08:03] to be a boldness amen there's going to
[2:08:05] be breath begin to form in your lungs
[2:08:06] you're going to prophesy again you're
[2:08:09] gonna prophesy before many kings and
[2:08:10] Nations amen you'll give a call out to
[2:08:13] this world you'll say whoever whosoever
[2:08:14] will let him come if you're thirsty why
[2:08:17] don't you come Amen to the place amen
[2:08:20] where this where this where this
[2:08:23] adoption power is unfolding
[2:08:27] Hallelujah and I love how brother Brown
[2:08:28] could I have just a few more moments I I
[2:08:30] don't know what time it is I fear that
[2:08:31] I've kept you amen but I love how
[2:08:33] brother Brahm said when Joshua spoke to
[2:08:35] that son for that battle he said Moses
[2:08:37] lifted his arms as it were in other
[2:08:39] words Moses wasn't there physically but
[2:08:42] figuratively it was as it was the
[2:08:44] ministry and the power that was in Moses
[2:08:46] is continuing right on through Joshua
[2:08:48] amen because they defeated that enemy
[2:08:50] just as sure as if Moses had been there
[2:08:51] to raise his hands Hallelujah brother
[2:08:54] sister and I believe today that the son
[2:08:56] of man Ministry that did many miraculous
[2:08:58] things in the ministry of William
[2:09:00] Branham I believe that same son of man
[2:09:02] is here amongst his people today and
[2:09:04] he's still doing the supernatural he's
[2:09:06] still changing lives he's still calling
[2:09:09] people out he's still placing people
[2:09:10] Amen in their adoption amen the Sheaf is
[2:09:14] still waving amen but there's a whole
[2:09:16] crop amen of original sea that's coming
[2:09:18] into the age of harvest
[2:09:21] as I was with Moses
[2:09:23] so I'll be with thee amen and I want you
[2:09:27] to see that this battle that Joshua was
[2:09:28] fighting right down in the evening time
[2:09:30] all by himself amen maybe for a moment
[2:09:33] wishing that Prophet was there to show
[2:09:34] him the way amen it was not a two-sided
[2:09:37] struggle
[2:09:38] and when you read the Bible you'll find
[2:09:40] out it wasn't a hope so it wasn't Joshua
[2:09:42] needed a little more light or he might
[2:09:44] not make it oh God it wasn't off God
[2:09:46] doesn't sin you know I said give us a
[2:09:48] little something then we just won't be
[2:09:50] able to hold on now uh this is a little
[2:09:53] Michigan slang they were beating a snot
[2:09:54] out of those guys
[2:09:56] amen they were absolutely wiping the
[2:09:58] floor with that enemy and the only
[2:09:59] reason Joshua needed that last little
[2:10:01] bit of light amen the only reason he
[2:10:03] needed something to say Amen was so they
[2:10:06] could wipe that enemy off once and for
[2:10:07] all and they'd never have to worry about
[2:10:09] them again and their children would
[2:10:11] never have to worry about it again and
[2:10:12] their grandchildren would never have to
[2:10:14] worry about it again amen why why did
[2:10:16] God send Joshua an evening light right
[2:10:18] at the latest Tower right when it looked
[2:10:20] like it was too late amen because Joshua
[2:10:22] amen had to finish the job amen Moses
[2:10:25] did his job brother Branham did his job
[2:10:28] amen but Joshua amen and Caleb it's time
[2:10:31] to rise to your feet and speak to your
[2:10:34] obstacle
[2:10:36] and let's finish this thing
[2:10:39] you realize the victory that you're on
[2:10:41] the threshold you're on the threshold of
[2:10:44] the final defeat of the king of Terrors
[2:10:46] you are the generation that will that
[2:10:49] will exterminate death
[2:10:52] amen Paul ran the race but he went by
[2:10:55] way of the Grave Peter ran the race but
[2:10:57] he went by way of the Grave Amen brother
[2:10:59] Branham ran a good race but he went by
[2:11:02] way of the grave but when this Mortal
[2:11:04] shall put on immortality the Bible says
[2:11:07] then then
[2:11:09] now shall be brought to pass the saying
[2:11:12] death is swallowed up in Victory
[2:11:17] amen let's all stand the night and give
[2:11:19] the Lord Praise
