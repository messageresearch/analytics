[19:19] requests this morning
[19:27] gracious Heavenly Father Lord we just
[19:29] thank you for allowing us to come here
[19:31] this morning we thank you for such a
[19:33] powerful service that we had last night
[19:35] and the Deliverance as that were made
[19:37] and the testimonies that are going to
[19:39] come forth of that of prodigals coming
[19:41] home Lord and sickness is being
[19:43] delivered and Lord Jesus as we come to
[19:45] you this morning we just ask your
[19:47] children forgive us of every fault every
[19:49] failure that may so easily beset us from
[19:51] you Lord that may hold us back from the
[19:53] Deliverance that we are seeking this
[19:54] morning and Lord Jesus I just think that
[19:57] every time that cancer is spoke across
[19:59] this pulpit
[20:00] that demon trembles because it is it is
[20:03] spoken across in need of prayer to a
[20:05] people that believe every word that you
[20:07] have brought to them in this day and
[20:09] Lord Jesus says the prophet stood time
[20:11] and time again and those demons would
[20:13] flee and those demons would they would
[20:15] have to give way in the name of the Lord
[20:16] Jesus Christ as you're the same
[20:18] yesterday today and forever and every
[20:20] time that we speak these needs in your
[20:22] name we know that you will come and be
[20:24] with us it's not a guessing it's not a
[20:26] asking when or how we just take your
[20:28] word and we believe it and we stand on
[20:30] it Lord Jesus I just ask that you'll
[20:33] just come down and be with each and
[20:34] every one that are sick the little
[20:36] children that are out the little
[20:37] children that are fighting different
[20:38] colds and different different ailments
[20:40] that are coming across our body even now
[20:42] Lord and we just ask you to be there
[20:44] with the ones that that have brought
[20:46] forth their friends and those ones in
[20:47] need because they they know that we are
[20:49] a church we are a church that believe
[20:51] and We Stand Together We Stand Together
[20:53] against every evil of this day because
[20:55] we are the light of this day and as
[20:57] Darkness creeps across every place as it
[21:00] creeps across into the street as Satan's
[21:02] trying to overtake every single one of
[21:04] your children we are people standing
[21:06] here that believe that you are a God
[21:07] that can put a hedge around each and
[21:09] every one of us and keep us safe we
[21:11] think just as just as we heard last
[21:13] weekend and the testimony that came
[21:15] forth is we could be driving down the
[21:16] road and evil come and try and take our
[21:19] life but you are guiding us and you're
[21:20] directing us your angels your guardian
[21:23] angels are around us and every every
[21:25] moment that we go and Lord Jesus I just
[21:27] ask that you'll just be here with the
[21:29] minister of the hour this morning be
[21:31] with him that he will be able to speak
[21:32] to our needs speak to every uh every
[21:35] answer that we are looking for this
[21:37] morning you know what we are looking for
[21:38] you know the burdens that we carry but
[21:40] I'm believing that each and every one of
[21:42] us everyone in this building needs a
[21:44] closer walk with you we do not need to
[21:47] come to a point to we are stagnant in
[21:49] our walk but we need to be able to draw
[21:50] closer to you at every moment and we
[21:52] strip every every tradition we strip
[21:54] everything that holds us and and binds
[21:56] us from drawing closer to you because
[21:58] one of these days we will take our last
[22:00] step and Satan we will have that last
[22:02] laugh and Lord Jesus I just ask that you
[22:04] will just be there with our be there

[22:08] you've done for him there give him
[22:10] strength and give them give them

[40:00] for for those that want to be baptized
[40:02] brother Ron will speak and and I just
[40:04] believe that the Lord is going to do
[40:06] something special and you see when you
[40:08] see a man of God get under under
[40:10] anointing like that it's it's the Lord
[40:12] that is up to something and and I know
[40:15] that there are many that are wanting to
[40:16] take on the name of the Lord may it and
[40:19] some that have not been baptized and
[40:20] there are some that that are wanting to
[40:22] be re-baptized and we just want to thank
[40:24] the Lord for that and so just want to
[40:26] make mention to you that that'll be next
[40:28] Sunday after service and you can bring a
[40:31] change of clothes and we'll you can

[58:33] if we were Pentecostals we just say we'd

[58:43] of the true Pentecostal of a Mark 16 in
[58:47] action
[58:49] your worship has gone forth and it's a
[58:52] time for the word to come forth
[58:56] you won't tag us with Pentecostal names
[58:58] we are true Pentecostals by an
[59:01] experience
[59:05] that which is about to come forth is the
[59:07] most important part to the Bride of
[59:09] Jesus Christ
[59:13] I'd like to speak to you
[59:17] foreign
[59:20] I'd like to speak to you on what you've
[59:23] just witnessed
[59:26] on anointed by accepting
[59:33] [Music]
[59:36] anointed by accepting
[59:40] if you have your Bibles this morning
[59:42] we'd like to look over in the New
[59:44] Testament over them
[59:46] John chapter 1.
[59:50] verse 11.
[1:00:07] it's a rather nice birthday gift when
[1:00:09] the Lord comes by
[1:00:12] happy birthday brother Stephen
[1:00:28] foreign
[1:00:33] just for a moment
[1:00:38] father how we love you
[1:00:42] Lord we can never thank you enough for
[1:00:45] what you have done in the midst of the
[1:00:46] Church of the Living God
[1:00:49] Lord your presence is so rich here
[1:00:51] father Lord the the atmosphere is
[1:00:54] charged with the Holy Spirit Lord the
[1:00:56] places just milky all over lord
[1:01:00] which sense that you're here Lord and
[1:01:02] now we've come to to break bread again
[1:01:05] father
[1:01:06] and Lord we've invited you in Lord Jesus
[1:01:09] and you've come
[1:01:10] and Lord Jesus as we take this word
[1:01:14] father
[1:01:15] Lord no man could break it like you can
[1:01:18] Lord no man can read it like you can no
[1:01:21] man can reveal it but you
[1:01:23] and we ask the Lord that you'd break
[1:01:24] bread to your disciples today and Lord
[1:01:27] let us recognize who we are in you
[1:01:31] father may we recognize where we are and
[1:01:34] may we recognize that we are in the
[1:01:36] presence of the same one
[1:01:39] that was here at the very beginning Lord
[1:01:43] thank you for your word
[1:01:45] in Jesus name amen
[1:01:49] I believe whatever you have need of this
[1:01:51] morning
[1:01:53] shall be met in the presence
[1:01:56] of The Great I Am
[1:01:59] John chapter 1 and verse 11.
[1:02:03] and he came unto his own and his own
[1:02:05] received him not
[1:02:07] but as many as received him to them gave
[1:02:11] you power to become the sons of God even
[1:02:14] to them that believe on his name which
[1:02:17] were born not of blood nor of the will
[1:02:21] of the flesh nor of the will of man but
[1:02:24] of God
[1:02:26] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:02:29] amongst us
[1:02:33] and we beheld his glory
[1:02:35] the glory as the of the only begotten of
[1:02:38] the father full of grace and of Truth
[1:02:44] and John bear witness of him and cried
[1:02:46] saying this was he of whom I spake he
[1:02:50] that cometh after me is preferred before
[1:02:52] me for he was before me and of his
[1:02:56] fullness have all we received Grace for
[1:02:59] Grace
[1:03:00] for the law was given by Moses
[1:03:04] but Grace and Truth came by Jesus Christ
[1:03:08] and no man has seen God at any time the
[1:03:12] only begotten son which is which is in
[1:03:15] the bosom of the father he hath declared
[1:03:19] him he hath openly showed him he hath
[1:03:22] openly manifested him
[1:03:24] verse 40.
[1:03:28] one of the two which heard John speak
[1:03:31] followed him
[1:03:32] and was
[1:03:34] Andrew Simon Peter's brother
[1:03:37] he first findeth his own brother Simon
[1:03:40] and saith unto him we have found the
[1:03:42] Messiah which is being interpreted the
[1:03:45] Christ and he brought him to Jesus and
[1:03:49] when Jesus beheld him he said Thou Art
[1:03:51] Simon the son of Jonah Thou Art
[1:03:55] Thou shalt be called cephas which is by
[1:03:58] interpretation
[1:04:00] a stone may God bless his word he may be
[1:04:03] seated this morning in the presence in
[1:04:05] the presence of the Lord as I said I'd
[1:04:07] like to speak to you this morning on
[1:04:09] anointed by accepting accepting as
[1:04:13] you're very aware it is the content
[1:04:16] consent to receive it is to receive
[1:04:19] willfully and it is to receive with with
[1:04:22] with to receive willingly and to give an
[1:04:26] affirmative answer to an offer or a
[1:04:29] proposal to say yes to it when you're
[1:04:31] when you are accepting something you're
[1:04:33] not turning it down but you're saying
[1:04:35] yes to it just like when Rebecca was
[1:04:38] standing there with Eliezer when she
[1:04:41] when Eliezer asked of the damsel what
[1:04:44] would be her response would she go to
[1:04:46] her Isaac and would she go and the and
[1:04:49] the mother and the brothers wanted her
[1:04:51] to stay a while longer but he said ask
[1:04:53] of the damsel what she will say and her
[1:04:56] response was I will go and what she was
[1:04:59] doing was accepting the call to go meet
[1:05:03] her Isaac and I believe that that is
[1:05:05] what is happening right here in the in
[1:05:07] the midst of the Church of the Living
[1:05:09] God is that there is a people that are
[1:05:11] accepting the call to go to go to their
[1:05:15] Isaac that is there that will meet us in
[1:05:17] the sky just like Isaac met his Rebecca
[1:05:21] out in the middle of the field this same
[1:05:24] Isaac our Lord Jesus Christ will meet us
[1:05:27] in the middle of the air in a twinkling
[1:05:30] of an eye and it is be it has been
[1:05:33] because you have accepted this Elise are
[1:05:35] calling this last day you have heard a
[1:05:38] cry you have heard a word go forth and
[1:05:40] it's called you by your name and you
[1:05:42] accepted him you accepted the Lord Jesus
[1:05:44] Christ as your savior you accepted him
[1:05:47] as your healer you accepted him as your
[1:05:50] provider you accepted him as your
[1:05:52] protector and you are anointed by
[1:05:55] accepting what Eve turned down now
[1:05:58] anybody that's familiar with the message
[1:05:59] you know exactly where I'm drawing this
[1:06:02] from in Christ the mystery God revealed
[1:06:04] William Branham said that in there there
[1:06:07] would be a Time come forth when he could
[1:06:09] express himself in the fullness of his
[1:06:11] godhead deity through his church let's
[1:06:15] say that together through his church and
[1:06:18] have the preeminence in this church oh
[1:06:20] my what the anointed man but now the
[1:06:23] anointed people oh my to bring back the
[1:06:25] anointed bride and the bridegroom notice
[1:06:28] it isn't the bride that is on display
[1:06:30] everywhere it's her and her bridegroom
[1:06:33] you see we're nothing without him are
[1:06:36] you with us tonight William Branham was
[1:06:37] nothing without the same bridegroom that
[1:06:40] you are fellowshipping with he was a man
[1:06:43] just like you are a man he was anointed
[1:06:45] just like you were anointed but what
[1:06:47] made the difference was Revelations 10 1
[1:06:50] was with Revelations 10 7 and that same
[1:06:54] Mighty angel that you read about in
[1:06:56] Revelations 10 1 is the same Mighty
[1:06:58] angel with a body in this generation of
[1:07:01] Revelations 10 8 through 11 and that is
[1:07:04] your portion of accepting what the
[1:07:07] mighty Angel asks you to do is to take
[1:07:09] the book accept the book and eat the
[1:07:11] book and you're watching what is
[1:07:13] happening in the midst of the Church of
[1:07:15] the Living God they are not just
[1:07:16] accepting or they're not just accepting
[1:07:18] some ordinary man but they are accepting
[1:07:21] the son of man that is coming in the
[1:07:24] body form again and you're watching him
[1:07:27] move in the Church of the Living God
[1:07:29] like never before he said it is the
[1:07:31] anointed man now the anointed people why
[1:07:34] am I to bring back the anointed bride
[1:07:36] and bridegroom anointed by why accepting
[1:07:40] what Eve turned down and Adam coming
[1:07:42] back with the anointing of the word
[1:07:44] because he said my word his Spirit see
[1:07:47] Anointed with the word what Eve turned
[1:07:50] down he comes back and we accept
[1:07:53] what he turned down and we come back he
[1:07:56] comes back and you and I accept it to
[1:07:59] think that today that you're sitting
[1:08:01] here you didn't get drawn here by your
[1:08:03] mother or by your own fleshly desire but
[1:08:06] it was a deep call to the deep that was
[1:08:09] drawing you that made you you couldn't
[1:08:11] live this way if you wanted to you yeah
[1:08:14] there's been many of people that tried
[1:08:16] there's been a media people that stood
[1:08:17] at the Forefront of it there's been a
[1:08:19] many of people that that looked on it
[1:08:21] but they didn't see Jesus like you see
[1:08:23] Jesus but the Bible tells us in second
[1:08:26] Peter 1 and 21 that the prophecy came
[1:08:29] not in Old Time by the will of man but
[1:08:33] holy men of God spake as they were moved
[1:08:35] by the Holy Ghost and it is that same
[1:08:38] moving of the spirit of the Living God
[1:08:40] that moves upon the waters that is
[1:08:42] drawing you unto himself and to think
[1:08:45] that the prophecy of old wasn't wasn't
[1:08:47] dealt with it wasn't brought by the will
[1:08:49] of Man by their own determination or by
[1:08:52] their own choice but it was the spirit
[1:08:54] of the Living God to think that that
[1:08:57] same one that is here that was on Jonah
[1:09:00] The Same Spirit that was that was back
[1:09:02] there with Noah as we heard about last
[1:09:04] night the same one that was with Daniel
[1:09:06] and the same one was with Isaiah he's
[1:09:09] the same one that is moving the Church
[1:09:11] of the Living God and that's one thing
[1:09:13] that Believers always watch for they
[1:09:16] watch for the Fulfillment of what the
[1:09:18] prophet said you see it's the
[1:09:20] identification of his presence is when
[1:09:22] the Lord has spoke something and then
[1:09:25] you watch the Fulfillment of it
[1:09:28] don't take me back 10 minutes ago I have
[1:09:31] myself a shout and fit all over again
[1:09:32] but to think that that right here this
[1:09:35] what you're in is a fulfillment and it
[1:09:37] is an identification of his presence
[1:09:40] it's when you watch a man of God like
[1:09:42] like William Branham or or a man like
[1:09:45] Paul that stayed with the word and you
[1:09:47] watch those men that stayed with the
[1:09:49] word and those Believers that are
[1:09:51] following that prophet's word they're
[1:09:53] watching that word they're watching it
[1:09:55] made manifest they're watching for the
[1:09:57] hour that it's going to come to fruition
[1:09:59] and when they are when that prophecy
[1:10:01] comes to fulfillment William Branham
[1:10:04] said it was that prophet's credentials
[1:10:06] I'll say this William Branham didn't get
[1:10:08] to see everything come to fruition but
[1:10:11] you are the prophet's credentials you
[1:10:14] are fulfilling what William Branham
[1:10:15] spoke of in this generation that there
[1:10:18] would be a final voice with a fine in
[1:10:20] the final age and would run this message
[1:10:22] right onto the coming of the Lord
[1:10:26] you see those prophets knew that the
[1:10:28] Messiah was coming the prophets they
[1:10:30] knew that if the Messiah didn't come
[1:10:32] that all of them were off all of them
[1:10:35] has missed it Micah missed it if if
[1:10:37] Jesus wasn't the Messiah my commenced it
[1:10:40] if Jesus was in the Messiah Isaiah
[1:10:43] missed it all of those prophets Moses
[1:10:45] missed it if he was sent that Messiah
[1:10:48] but Jesus was the credentials of what
[1:10:51] those prophets had spoke of
[1:10:54] and I believe that Jesus of Nazareth
[1:10:57] fulfilled every description that all
[1:10:59] that the prophets had spoke of him to be
[1:11:02] that Messiah and the Messiah means to be
[1:11:04] the anointed one it means to be the
[1:11:07] anointed king anoint means to authorize
[1:11:10] and when Jesus was here he is the
[1:11:13] Messiah and that same Messiah is in the
[1:11:17] Church of the Living God he's not just
[1:11:19] with you but he's in you and Jesus said
[1:11:22] in John 14 and 20 that at that day you
[1:11:25] shall know that I am in the father and
[1:11:27] the father and me and I in you and to
[1:11:30] think that this is that day he wasn't a
[1:11:34] day gone by but it's right now
[1:11:36] and when Jesus was there he fully
[1:11:39] accepted that he was the Messiah he knew
[1:11:42] who he was he accepted who he was he
[1:11:45] never walked around and hung his head
[1:11:47] down saying oh I'm not the Messiah I'm
[1:11:49] not the Son of God if you believe that
[1:11:52] if you think that Jesus didn't say he
[1:11:54] was the son of God you've never read
[1:11:56] throughout the Bible but Jesus put his
[1:11:58] voice with what those prophets had spoke
[1:12:01] so Jesus put his own and he clearly
[1:12:04] identified that I am he that the prophet
[1:12:07] spoke of that I am the Messiah
[1:12:12] what is it you are anointed by accepting
[1:12:15] what Eve turned down and when he comes
[1:12:17] back when you go reading over in John
[1:12:19] chapter 14 and verse 3 that that in my
[1:12:22] father's house are many mansions that I
[1:12:25] will come again and here he is in this
[1:12:28] last stage let's read it together and if
[1:12:31] I go and prepare a place for you I will
[1:12:33] come again you can do everything you
[1:12:36] want to me but you can never take that
[1:12:38] away from me that this is that coming I
[1:12:42] will come again and receive you unto
[1:12:45] myself this is the coming of the Lord
[1:12:48] Jesus Christ in body form
[1:12:53] this is the bride coming of Christ
[1:12:55] coming back with the anointing of the
[1:12:57] word because he said my word is spirit
[1:12:59] see
[1:13:01] you you go and I know that I know that
[1:13:04] I've got every devil in hell a little
[1:13:07] shook up this morning because the
[1:13:08] presence of the Lord is here and they
[1:13:10] need to be scared
[1:13:11] every devil needs to run for cover this
[1:13:14] morning because there is an anointing
[1:13:16] here that'll drive every sickness away
[1:13:18] it'll drive every disease away it'll
[1:13:21] drive every evil spirit of anxiety and
[1:13:24] depression the anointing of the Lord is
[1:13:27] here
[1:13:30] but you go to reading throughout the Old
[1:13:32] Testament and you can find it in Genesis
[1:13:34] that that men would build altars and
[1:13:37] they would anoint they would anoint with
[1:13:39] oil and they would anoint stumps they'd
[1:13:41] anoint rocks and you can find over in
[1:13:43] Leviticus when Moses was setting up the
[1:13:45] levitical priesthood that he would go in
[1:13:48] there and he would anoint the vessels in
[1:13:50] the Tabernacle he'd go in there and he
[1:13:52] would sprinkle the oil of gladness upon
[1:13:56] Aaron and his sons and upon all the
[1:13:58] vessels that were there he would take
[1:14:01] and he would pour the anointing oil and
[1:14:03] sprinkle it there he was anointing to
[1:14:06] sanctify those for service and you can
[1:14:10] find it throughout the Old Testament
[1:14:11] that prophets were anointed you can find
[1:14:14] when when when kings were set up you can
[1:14:17] look when Saul when Saul come under the
[1:14:19] rain and he was he was under the
[1:14:21] ministry of Samuel at the time that
[1:14:23] Samuel found him out into a field and he
[1:14:26] poured the oil of anointing upon him you
[1:14:29] behind when David was being set up when
[1:14:32] he was back there on the back side of
[1:14:34] that desert and he went before Jesse's
[1:14:37] all of his sons and they were stacked
[1:14:39] out there he didn't never he never
[1:14:41] poured the anointing oil upon any of
[1:14:44] those brothers except for David now to
[1:14:47] think about this that anointing is not
[1:14:49] Talent
[1:14:51] there's a major difference between
[1:14:53] talent and anointing
[1:14:55] there's a lot of people that can play
[1:14:56] the piano there's a lot of people that
[1:14:58] know how to hit the right keys but
[1:15:00] there's a major difference between
[1:15:02] somebody that is an anointed piano
[1:15:04] player there's a lot of people that can
[1:15:06] speak better than myself there's a lot
[1:15:08] of people that can sing better than
[1:15:09] myself but it's a major difference
[1:15:11] between somebody just speaking
[1:15:13] reverently or speaking nicely but
[1:15:16] there's a major difference between just
[1:15:17] speaking and an anointed speaker it
[1:15:20] isn't a man's style that makes him
[1:15:22] anointed it's the anointing of the Holy
[1:15:24] Ghost that has got a man under supreme
[1:15:26] power under Supreme control that is
[1:15:30] moving him I've watched a lot of piano
[1:15:32] players that never can find the
[1:15:34] anointing of God but they can play
[1:15:36] better than anybody else that you've
[1:15:38] ever heard naturally looking at the
[1:15:40] talent of it but they haven't no
[1:15:42] anointing to go with it you watch an
[1:15:44] anointed piano player your mother be a
[1:15:46] brother or a sister there when the
[1:15:48] spirit of the Living God just like
[1:15:50] sister Cassie caught it she caught that
[1:15:52] anointing and she began to pray the Lord
[1:15:54] bless you and the Lord keep you what was
[1:15:57] it it was an anointing that God on
[1:16:00] sister Cassie and moved her to play the
[1:16:03] song for the moment
[1:16:05] you watch there's a lot of people that
[1:16:07] can preach there's a lot of people can
[1:16:09] talk but we don't want just some good
[1:16:11] talk we want some anointed preaching we
[1:16:14] want something that'll break the
[1:16:16] strongholds of Satan off of our life we
[1:16:19] want something that our girls can come
[1:16:21] to and recognize that they can be
[1:16:23] delivered we want an anointing
[1:16:27] we want an anointing that'll break
[1:16:29] cancer we won an anointing that'll
[1:16:32] destroy every devil and there is an
[1:16:34] anointing in the Messiah and his name is
[1:16:37] Jesus and that's Saint Jesus is in body
[1:16:40] form once again
[1:16:43] I say as a Church of the Living God we
[1:16:46] want his anointing
[1:16:47] [Applause]
[1:16:54] it wasn't the oil
[1:16:56] that made David anointed
[1:16:58] because Samuel could have went there and
[1:17:01] he could have poured that shame oil over
[1:17:03] top of all of Jesse's sons and they
[1:17:06] never would have been anointed king
[1:17:07] because God had seen David and David was
[1:17:11] a man after God's Own Heart you see you
[1:17:14] could have took those same oil it was a
[1:17:16] type of what God had already seen on the
[1:17:19] inside of David
[1:17:22] I'm gonna tell you I'm gonna have a hard
[1:17:24] time today I'm gonna have a hard time
[1:17:25] today but there's a lot of people that
[1:17:28] may be stacked up against you bigger in
[1:17:30] stature got a better education but they
[1:17:33] can never work their way out of a paper
[1:17:35] bag but the Bride of Jesus Christ has
[1:17:38] got such an anointing on her she can
[1:17:41] sing Down Heaven she can praise Down
[1:17:43] Heaven she can worship Down Heaven and
[1:17:46] when the enemy comes in like the flood
[1:17:48] the spirit that's on the inside of that
[1:17:51] body will cause sickness sickness call
[1:17:54] black black gold white white it is the
[1:17:57] anointing
[1:18:00] you wouldn't be here if you didn't
[1:18:02] accept this
[1:18:05] you're anointed by accepting it
[1:18:08] and the rest of the world is Anointed by
[1:18:10] rejecting it
[1:18:16] you see the Hebrews believe from that
[1:18:18] day forward
[1:18:19] that the spirit of God was in David the
[1:18:22] very Mind Of God was in David it was the
[1:18:26] oil it was a type of the life of the
[1:18:29] Holy Ghost that is on the believer today
[1:18:33] when Elders come and they lay their
[1:18:36] hands on the sick and they anoint them
[1:18:37] with oil and the prayer of faith is
[1:18:39] prayed over them it is a type of the
[1:18:42] Holy Ghost that is backing up that
[1:18:44] believer's prayer you watch what will
[1:18:46] happen if you really come under the
[1:18:48] office of the Holy Ghost and you ask a
[1:18:51] man of God or a deacon or some brother
[1:18:53] or some sister that has the anointing
[1:18:55] upon them I'm not just talking something
[1:18:57] far off I'm talking to you that there is
[1:19:00] an anointing that Isaiah 10 and 27 told
[1:19:03] us that there would be a burden on you
[1:19:06] and it will be taken away but it is the
[1:19:09] anointing that breaks the yoke
[1:19:12] sister Sean you can have a burden on
[1:19:14] your life but let the anointing come by
[1:19:17] your way and it's the anointing that
[1:19:19] breaks the Yoke off of your life you can
[1:19:21] have all kinds of things and you watch
[1:19:23] as the anointing flows
[1:19:26] and it'll break the very bondage off of
[1:19:28] your life it's the anointing that does
[1:19:31] it
[1:19:31] it isn't the man it's the one that he
[1:19:34] represents that is doing the work
[1:19:37] notice what Psalms 28 and 8 says the
[1:19:40] Lord is our strength and he is a saving
[1:19:44] strength of his anointed Psalms 45 and 7
[1:19:48] thou love is righteousness and hated
[1:19:50] wickedness therefore God thy God hath
[1:19:53] anointed thee somebody say thee with the
[1:19:57] oil of gladness above thy fellows second
[1:20:00] Corinthians 1 and 21 now he would
[1:20:03] establish us with you in Christ hath
[1:20:06] anointed us he anointed us is God that
[1:20:10] the one that is Anointed you is not the
[1:20:12] man it is God
[1:20:14] it's just like when David was was
[1:20:17] writing up Psalms 23 he said you have
[1:20:20] prepared a table before me in the
[1:20:23] presence of my enemies thou anointest my
[1:20:26] head with oil and my cup a runneth over
[1:20:29] and to think that the anointing has been
[1:20:32] poured out on this body today
[1:20:36] that has been poured out upon this body
[1:20:38] today that your cup is running over when
[1:20:41] David is saying that he's saying I have
[1:20:44] an abundance of the Holy Ghost
[1:20:48] Hallelujah and that's what Satan is
[1:20:50] trying to do he's trying to keep you
[1:20:52] with a teacup he's trying to keep you so
[1:20:54] you don't get filled up but my head has
[1:20:57] been anointed now in hand is my Lord
[1:21:01] Jesus Christ and they overflow is on the
[1:21:04] body and Jesus said it's an abundance
[1:21:08] you know what Satan is to do he's come
[1:21:10] to kill to steal and to destroy but
[1:21:12] Jesus said I come to give you life and
[1:21:14] life more abundantly he's wanting you to
[1:21:17] flow over run over and I know David said
[1:21:20] surely in Mercy and goodness shall
[1:21:23] follow me all the days of my life
[1:21:28] Hallelujah
[1:21:31] go back to our text on I came unto my
[1:21:34] own
[1:21:36] and my own received me not
[1:21:38] but to them that believed on me to them
[1:21:41] I gave power to receive notice what John
[1:21:45] 3 and 27 said that John answered and
[1:21:48] said a man can receive nothing except to
[1:21:51] be given him from Heaven to think that
[1:21:54] Heavens gave you what you got
[1:21:57] now notice when you start breaking down
[1:21:59] that word receive in the Greek Lexicon
[1:22:02] it is lambeno which means to receive to
[1:22:06] take to have to catch it is to take with
[1:22:09] the hand or to take up a thing to be
[1:22:12] carried to be carried or to take upon
[1:22:15] oneself to claim for oneself and Jesus
[1:22:19] said in John 5 and 43 that I am come in
[1:22:22] my father's name and you receive me not
[1:22:25] if another succumb in his own name him
[1:22:27] you will receive how can you believe
[1:22:29] which receive lambanum which take a hold
[1:22:33] take a hold for oneself which receive
[1:22:36] honor one of another and seek not the
[1:22:39] honor that Cometh From God only we don't
[1:22:42] want to seek the honor of men we want to
[1:22:44] seek the honor that comes from God and
[1:22:47] for you to be able to catch that honor
[1:22:49] it is him that has tooken you he's
[1:22:53] grabbed you he snatched you out of the
[1:22:55] hands of the enemy when he thought he
[1:22:57] was gonna get your sister Hannah God
[1:23:00] rich in Mercy
[1:23:02] God rich in Mercy saw something on the
[1:23:05] inside of your sisters who that men
[1:23:07] didn't see others didn't see but God
[1:23:10] Almighty saw you in your weakness he saw
[1:23:13] you in your condemnation but there is
[1:23:15] therefore now no condemnation to them
[1:23:19] that are in Christ Jesus who walk not
[1:23:21] after the flesh but after the spirit
[1:23:29] what's been poured out as a message
[1:23:30] anointing has been poured out upon this
[1:23:33] elect lady
[1:23:34] and you're not just under any anointing
[1:23:37] but you're under the anointing of a fine
[1:23:39] equal and you're reminded when you go
[1:23:41] through the seals that William Branham
[1:23:43] told us that every single time there
[1:23:45] went out of a white horse rider a black
[1:23:47] horse a red horse and a pale horse that
[1:23:49] there was a there was a power that went
[1:23:52] forth to combat that thing to watch that
[1:23:55] when you when you watch when it was the
[1:23:58] Antichrist that was riding in the first
[1:23:59] and all the way down through the fourth
[1:24:01] it was the anointing of Christ that
[1:24:04] moved on the anointing of a lion and an
[1:24:06] ox and a man and an ego anointing but
[1:24:09] this that you are under is a flying
[1:24:12] eagle anointing
[1:24:14] and man can't stop this anointing to
[1:24:17] think that this anointing that you have
[1:24:19] today
[1:24:20] I'm doing my best not to not to preach
[1:24:23] it to you I'm down I'm trying my best to
[1:24:25] kind of give it to you in a way that I
[1:24:27] wouldn't typically do but I'm trying to
[1:24:29] give it to you that the anointing that
[1:24:32] this body is under
[1:24:35] was not a man it was the anointing of
[1:24:38] the Flying Eagle which is Christ
[1:24:41] which is Christ and when you look up
[1:24:44] there and you see that anointing and you
[1:24:46] see that prophets here that eagle was
[1:24:49] able to pierce through the darkness
[1:24:53] and to think that your Prophet couldn't
[1:24:55] even see past 1977 that it was that dark
[1:24:58] but you're still standing
[1:25:01] you're still here you're still
[1:25:03] overcoming you've still got the goods
[1:25:05] what is it it's the anointing
[1:25:07] [Applause]
[1:25:14] we are under the Dominion of the
[1:25:16] anointed one
[1:25:18] you see you're under you're under a
[1:25:20] divine order
[1:25:22] that came from above this body has a
[1:25:26] declaration about her
[1:25:28] and you're under divine order and
[1:25:30] brother Brandon would tell us that all
[1:25:32] the way back there in the Garden of Eden
[1:25:34] I heard him the other day said in the
[1:25:37] water from The Rock he said you see me
[1:25:38] he said he said I acted just he said
[1:25:41] I've handled things where I acted just a
[1:25:43] little bit different you've seen it on
[1:25:44] me he said I was watching Adam and Eve
[1:25:47] walk out of the garden
[1:25:49] what was it is a prophet that could look
[1:25:52] all the way back but a prophet could
[1:25:54] look all the way in the future and to
[1:25:56] think he wouldn't show him everything
[1:25:58] but he did show you he did so your
[1:26:01] Prophet that you would be standing there
[1:26:03] on the other side of the curtain of time
[1:26:08] how are you going to get there by
[1:26:10] accepting this anointing
[1:26:12] how you going to make it through
[1:26:13] laodicea by accepting what God said
[1:26:16] about you if you accept what Satan said
[1:26:18] about you you wouldn't have been in the
[1:26:20] building if you had accepted what the
[1:26:22] critics said about you you'd have never
[1:26:24] showed up this morning but because you
[1:26:26] accepted what God has said about you if
[1:26:29] God before you who can be against you
[1:26:31] there's a lot of people that's a lot of
[1:26:34] talking a lot of mouth but the body of
[1:26:36] Jesus Christ has thus saith the Lord or
[1:26:38] she sit still this body is under the
[1:26:41] anointing of Malachi 4 and it will take
[1:26:44] you all the way into the rapture
[1:26:46] [Applause]
[1:26:53] my brother man said that Paul when he
[1:26:55] went up there in that City he said
[1:26:57] Timothy he said in that City Timothy was
[1:27:00] the only one that was up there of like
[1:27:02] Precious faith that he had he said you
[1:27:04] know he said the rest of them was a
[1:27:06] bunch of denominationalism
[1:27:09] he said but when he got up there into
[1:27:11] that atmosphere where Timothy was he
[1:27:14] said you find those things going on you
[1:27:16] see there was up there and they were
[1:27:18] having a healing campaign
[1:27:20] they were up there and they were having
[1:27:22] Miracles that were done in their life he
[1:27:24] said when he got in that kind of
[1:27:25] atmosphere he said you find those kind
[1:27:27] of things going on he said that's the
[1:27:30] atmosphere that has created you find
[1:27:33] people living by faith in that
[1:27:35] atmosphere
[1:27:36] you see every one of you sitting here
[1:27:38] are under the atmosphere of Faith this
[1:27:40] morning I'm challenging you to believe
[1:27:43] challenging you to believe that the
[1:27:45] omnipotence is right here I'm
[1:27:47] challenging you to believe that the
[1:27:49] pillar fire is still amongst the Church
[1:27:51] of the Living God I'm challenging you to
[1:27:53] believe that there is no cancer there is
[1:27:56] no tuberculosis there is no skin disease
[1:27:59] there is no trouble that can stand up to
[1:28:02] the anointing
[1:28:07] if William Branham saw that you were
[1:28:10] going down in defeat he would have told
[1:28:11] you so
[1:28:14] if there'd have been another age coming
[1:28:16] he'd have told you so but William
[1:28:18] Branham said you're going to be born of
[1:28:19] his bone life of his life power over his
[1:28:22] power if that angel stood there
[1:28:32] I am come from the presence of the Lord
[1:28:35] we recognize that William Brandon was
[1:28:38] very specific that the angel that came
[1:28:40] to him was not Jesus it was the angel of
[1:28:43] the Lord William Branham told us that he
[1:28:46] saw Jesus out there in that field he was
[1:28:48] standing out there Jesus was a real
[1:28:50] short man
[1:28:52] but the angel the Lord that came to him
[1:28:54] was about six foot tall had shoulder
[1:28:56] length hair had the olive complexion he
[1:28:58] said but when I was out there in that
[1:28:59] field he said I saw Jesus out there he
[1:29:02] said he had such eyes he said if he
[1:29:04] would have spoke he said the world who
[1:29:06] could have stopped he could have stopped
[1:29:08] moving he said but in one moment he said
[1:29:10] there was such peace about him
[1:29:13] I'm saying unto you that that same Jesus
[1:29:16] is here
[1:29:20] that's saying Jesus is right here and
[1:29:22] when William Brandon was standing there
[1:29:24] and he was dealing with patience I know
[1:29:26] some of you may not understand what I'm
[1:29:27] saying but there was a healing Angel do
[1:29:29] you believe that that there was a
[1:29:31] healing angel that was standing at the
[1:29:33] pulpit you can go back and I I could
[1:29:35] pull out ten thousand quotes for you I
[1:29:38] won't do it because I know that you're
[1:29:39] well studied and you listen to the
[1:29:41] message but William Madam would stand
[1:29:43] there and he would say now now you feel
[1:29:45] a real you feel a real sweet feeling
[1:29:48] about you and right around you he said
[1:29:50] it's the angel of the Lord that's
[1:29:53] standing between me and you and to think
[1:29:56] that if I would have brother Gabriel
[1:29:58] stand up this morning go ahead I'd stand
[1:30:00] up and I'd say now now you feel this
[1:30:02] presence that's about you and and you
[1:30:05] feel it's real sweet and sometimes you
[1:30:07] can feel it just kind of whip behind you
[1:30:09] now don't you be nervous about that it's
[1:30:12] just the angel of the Lord now watch
[1:30:14] brother Brandon would take a patient
[1:30:16] like this and he would tell him down now
[1:30:18] you see I see you you've got this
[1:30:20] condition you've got this weakness in
[1:30:22] your body and I see it upon you he said
[1:30:25] but they're standing in front of you is
[1:30:27] a well body and if you can get under it
[1:30:29] and walk to that well body and take your
[1:30:31] face he said it's the angel of the Lord
[1:30:33] that'll lead you to that well body thank
[1:30:36] you to think that there is an angel that
[1:30:38] is here
[1:30:40] let's go study the quotes one time about
[1:30:43] brother random talking about Jacob's
[1:30:45] Ladder about the Angels coming and
[1:30:47] ascending and descending upon Jacob's
[1:30:49] Ladder just go reading over there on
[1:30:51] that he said brother Adam said that
[1:30:53] God's got angels that are at their
[1:30:55] postal duty this morning watching over
[1:30:57] the aisles watching over his children
[1:30:59] there's angels that are acting poster
[1:31:03] duty to make sure that you get it some
[1:31:06] people would got up and went to the
[1:31:07] bathroom but there's an angel said stay
[1:31:09] right there don't go just yet there's
[1:31:11] something coming for you
[1:31:17] you think I'm far off brother Brandon
[1:31:19] said he'd watch evil spirits come and
[1:31:21] tell people to get up and go to the
[1:31:22] bathroom and they miss their they miss
[1:31:24] their anointing
[1:31:27] that'll make you think twice about going
[1:31:30] to the bathroom morning
[1:31:31] now don't Piggy Pants you go ahead
[1:31:32] that's what it is but I'm telling you
[1:31:34] you're in an atmosphere where there's an
[1:31:36] anointing here to make sure you get what
[1:31:38] you get
[1:31:40] you didn't you didn't spend all your
[1:31:42] time asking just for nothing you asked
[1:31:44] because you wanted to get something from
[1:31:46] the Lord
[1:31:48] and to think that all the way back there
[1:31:50] in the Garden of Eden that there was two
[1:31:52] atmospheres that was back there go to
[1:31:54] listening to wisdom versus faith and
[1:31:56] brother banham said that there Eve got
[1:31:58] under the wrong atmosphere he said she
[1:32:00] let go of one atmosphere and went to
[1:32:03] another and she got out there and she
[1:32:05] started reasoning with the word of God
[1:32:07] when Satan interjected one word
[1:32:12] what was it unbelief broke the anointing
[1:32:15] that she was under and she went out
[1:32:17] there and you watch how Satan will move
[1:32:19] in your life and he'll get you out from
[1:32:21] an atmosphere of faith and he'll bring
[1:32:23] you under an atmosphere of knowledge but
[1:32:25] brother Branham told us he said there's
[1:32:27] not he said if you can preach this word
[1:32:29] if the word is preached and it's
[1:32:31] completely Simplicity and in its
[1:32:33] completeness he said the knowledge can
[1:32:36] never overshadow the faith of the people
[1:32:39] that's in that word now let me bring it
[1:32:42] to you just a little bit more Elementary
[1:32:43] so you understand what I'm saying that
[1:32:45] there's little girls right here that
[1:32:47] could take this word in its Simplicity
[1:32:49] and its completeness and speak worlds
[1:32:52] into existence
[1:32:54] I don't have to tell you that there is
[1:32:57] an angel that is here this morning
[1:32:58] because you feel the anointing of that
[1:33:01] angel I want to speak to you and tell
[1:33:04] you that you are going to leave here
[1:33:06] with that anointing on your life it's
[1:33:08] not just going to stay in the building
[1:33:13] Pulpit ain't anointed that wall that
[1:33:16] drywall ain't anointed but you are
[1:33:18] anointed
[1:33:20] you are what God came for God didn't
[1:33:23] come for that piano yes he can use a
[1:33:25] piano he ain't come for that guitar yes
[1:33:28] he can use a guitar he didn't come for
[1:33:30] the lights he came for you
[1:33:34] you are the anointed once that's what
[1:33:37] William Branham told us in the Messiah
[1:33:38] that he was the anointed one but you are
[1:33:41] the Lesser lights that makes you just as
[1:33:43] powerful as Jesus you are the little
[1:33:46] anointed once and Satan can throw
[1:33:49] everything that at you but he ain't got
[1:33:51] enough
[1:33:52] [Applause]
[1:33:55] come on somebody what's in your hand
[1:33:58] Moses
[1:34:00] it's a rod cast it down he turned into a
[1:34:04] snake take it up again he turned him
[1:34:06] back into a rod
[1:34:08] what was it when Jesus was up there at
[1:34:11] Calvary and he took the serpent and he
[1:34:13] took your judgment for you he threw all
[1:34:16] of your judgment away because he took it
[1:34:19] upon himself little bride what's in your
[1:34:22] hand it's the king's sword and I want to
[1:34:25] speak to you and tell you that what you
[1:34:27] have in your hand will devour all of
[1:34:29] Pharaoh's Magic
[1:34:32] he might have some copycats that'll
[1:34:35] stand up there by the name of Janice and
[1:34:36] jambres but I want to tell you that
[1:34:39] under the anointing of the third poll
[1:34:40] there can be no mimics
[1:34:43] there can be no illustrations they can't
[1:34:45] be no mimics there can't be no makeups
[1:34:48] they're Satan don't even know what the
[1:34:50] third pool is but you are the third pool
[1:34:53] the third pool is in you
[1:35:00] and the Bride of Jesus Christ is a
[1:35:03] complete paradox
[1:35:06] you begin to think about where the
[1:35:08] message
[1:35:10] or the message caught you and you begin
[1:35:12] to think about how far the message has
[1:35:14] brought you you can't even think the
[1:35:16] same way
[1:35:17] laughs I know I ain't alone here
[1:35:21] but we're all Sinners saved by the grace
[1:35:23] of God
[1:35:25] but you can't even think the same way
[1:35:27] because the Messiah has come by your way
[1:35:29] and changed your thinking because you no
[1:35:32] longer have your mind but you have the
[1:35:35] mind of Christ with Philippians 2 and 5
[1:35:37] tells us that this mind let it be in you
[1:35:40] you can't even think the same way
[1:35:42] because the message has come by your way
[1:35:44] and you watch people that have rejected
[1:35:46] this message they can't even think the
[1:35:48] same way because they've come under this
[1:35:50] message you can reject it all you want
[1:35:52] to but you gather Knowledge from this
[1:35:54] message and there's a lot of people that
[1:35:57] are throwing darts back at us because
[1:35:59] they've got knowledge but where they get
[1:36:01] that knowledge at they got it under the
[1:36:03] ministry of Malachi 4 and to think
[1:36:05] they're anointed by rejecting this
[1:36:07] message how much more powerful
[1:36:10] when they get on their blogs and they
[1:36:12] get on their computers and they make you
[1:36:14] feel like you ain't nothing but a little
[1:36:16] old bitty and you stand there and shaken
[1:36:18] tries to push you back by Darkness don't
[1:36:20] you accept that you stand there Toe to
[1:36:23] Toe with that devil there's power in the
[1:36:26] body you have been anointed to accept
[1:36:31] know what I'm talking about
[1:36:34] another man said he said he said now he
[1:36:37] said you can see now the end time
[1:36:39] message why it's rejected he said now no
[1:36:42] denomination but the revelation of his
[1:36:44] mystery see no denomination the
[1:36:46] revelation God is not known by a
[1:36:48] denomination he is known by Revelation
[1:36:51] and to think that today that Revelation
[1:36:55] has struck your heart that you can no
[1:36:57] longer think the same way that you were
[1:36:59] before you're a complete paradox but
[1:37:03] William Branham would speak on that six
[1:37:04] times on the air Paradox and it's
[1:37:07] incredible but yet it's true
[1:37:12] I just want you to just take a breather
[1:37:14] just for a moment and I want you to
[1:37:16] think about your life as a paradox
[1:37:21] where your
[1:37:22] and where you are now
[1:37:24] that it was the anointing that brought
[1:37:26] you to where you are
[1:37:31] I look all over his building it ain't
[1:37:33] it's full of nothing nothing but a bunch
[1:37:35] of paradoxes when you begin to read over
[1:37:37] in the Book of Joshua that that Joshua
[1:37:39] was there and you can go and read and
[1:37:41] Joshua 1 all the way down to nine that
[1:37:43] he was there that as God was with Moses
[1:37:46] he said so I will be with you that
[1:37:49] everywhere that the place of your souls
[1:37:51] tread upon that have I given unto you
[1:37:53] and Joshua is under commission to
[1:37:56] breaking down the borders and showing
[1:37:58] where the children of Israel where they
[1:38:00] were and you go to reading over in the
[1:38:02] Book of Joshua it's a great it's a great
[1:38:04] study how it parallels Ephesians and you
[1:38:06] can watch that you have been accepted in
[1:38:08] the Beloved and to think that you're
[1:38:10] under a Joshua commission and you're
[1:38:12] watching you go reading over in Joshua
[1:38:14] and Joshua 1 Joshua 2 Joshua 3 and you
[1:38:18] read about a paradox Rahab the believer
[1:38:22] foreign
[1:38:23] you think about where she was to where
[1:38:26] she was after the message came by her
[1:38:28] way it was a complete Paradox saying
[1:38:31] Rahab was a believer
[1:38:38] to think
[1:38:40] I picked on him last weekend might as
[1:38:41] well get him again to think that out in
[1:38:43] Frasier would be a believer it's a
[1:38:45] complete paradox
[1:38:47] to think that brother Lawrence would be
[1:38:49] sitting here as a complete Paradox you
[1:38:51] can call your name it's a complete
[1:38:53] Paradox to think that where this message
[1:38:55] caught you and it brought you from and
[1:38:58] you watch under that jaw that Joshua
[1:39:00] commissioned that Rahab was brought out
[1:39:02] Jericho was conquered lands were
[1:39:04] conquered enemies were disposed and you
[1:39:07] are under a Joshua commission and you
[1:39:10] watch every single time you know you
[1:39:11] know and I'm just I'm just teaching some
[1:39:13] things here this morning but brother
[1:39:15] random said he could flip open every
[1:39:17] Bible
[1:39:18] and it would flip over to Joshua chapter
[1:39:20] one and you remember when William
[1:39:22] Brandon was there that there was a hand
[1:39:24] that came down from the sky with a cuff
[1:39:27] and enrolled all the way down from
[1:39:29] Joshua 1 all the way to Joshua 9. it was
[1:39:32] showing what commission that the church
[1:39:34] is under and to think that you have
[1:39:37] every right this morning
[1:39:40] you have every right as a son and
[1:39:42] daughter of God with the authority of a
[1:39:44] messiah inside of you to cast Satan away
[1:39:47] to move Satan off of your property to
[1:39:50] move him off of your household if you've
[1:39:52] got a Rahab don't you worry she's going
[1:39:55] to be a believer if you if you got it
[1:39:58] Jacob don't you worry he's going to be
[1:40:00] in Israel don't you worry God's going to
[1:40:04] get his seed
[1:40:07] [Applause]
[1:40:14] Believers watch for that fulfillment
[1:40:17] and watching for it to come to pass
[1:40:22] is the identification
[1:40:24] of the prophet's prophecy
[1:40:27] and when it comes to pass then history
[1:40:30] has been made
[1:40:34] and you begin to watch this third pool
[1:40:37] Ministry that you're under
[1:40:41] and you watch as it calls to you
[1:40:45] what is it doing it's pulling you what
[1:40:48] did it do how do you write
[1:40:50] uphold her
[1:40:52] to think that I can accept the
[1:40:55] impossible as possible
[1:40:58] I can accept the supernatural As Natural
[1:41:01] for a believer
[1:41:04] what was it it was pulling her
[1:41:06] I heard I heard I think it was brother
[1:41:08] Wayne he was speaking and he said he
[1:41:10] said if she'd have been Hattie right
[1:41:11] would have been under the ministry of
[1:41:13] Oral Roberts or the ministry of T.L
[1:41:15] Osborne she'd asked for a million
[1:41:17] dollars he said but because she was
[1:41:19] under the ministry of William Branham
[1:41:20] she asked for her two Souls
[1:41:22] to the two Souls of her sons and to
[1:41:25] think that where you are you're not
[1:41:27] asking for things that are going to pass
[1:41:28] away but you have this treasure and
[1:41:31] Earth and vessel and because you're
[1:41:33] under this ministry you can see exactly
[1:41:35] what William Branham taught us in Psalms
[1:41:37] 42 and 7 that a deep cause to the deep
[1:41:40] and to think that there if there was
[1:41:42] nothing there they wouldn't make no
[1:41:44] longing in your heart to draw onto this
[1:41:46] message and to draw closer to God but
[1:41:49] because there is a deep call to the Deep
[1:41:52] there's a deep to respond you can take
[1:41:54] it to the mess of this and they won't
[1:41:56] accept it you can take it to the
[1:41:57] Presbyterians or the Pentecostals down
[1:41:59] the road and they won't accept it
[1:42:01] because there's no deep there calling
[1:42:03] for it but on the inside of this body
[1:42:06] there's something calling on the inside
[1:42:09] of her to come up here a little bit
[1:42:11] closer to him
[1:42:14] it's a deep call into the deep there's
[1:42:16] something there's a new life there
[1:42:19] now brother William could probably I
[1:42:22] tested this just a little bit better
[1:42:23] than myself
[1:42:24] but how long you been married
[1:42:28] almost 17 years praise the Lord
[1:42:30] a long time living one woman in
[1:42:33] if you get the right one today just
[1:42:35] getting subscribe we love you
[1:42:38] but your watches hey they went through
[1:42:40] they went through their their courtship
[1:42:42] and they went through their engagement
[1:42:44] and went into the marriage she ate one
[1:42:46] way she's eaten one way
[1:42:48] and she's eating that way all the way
[1:42:49] through courtship she eats the same
[1:42:51] things all the way through her
[1:42:52] engagement Jesus same thing through her
[1:42:54] marriage and all of a sudden she wakes
[1:42:56] up into the middle of night and she's
[1:42:57] one watermelon in the middle of January
[1:43:01] or she's wanting peanut butter on some
[1:43:03] pickles there's something changed on the
[1:43:05] inside of her
[1:43:07] now whether he had a whether he had a
[1:43:09] pregnancy test to show it or not he
[1:43:11] recognizes that there's something that
[1:43:13] is calling that's calling for a craving
[1:43:16] and you recognize that that in the
[1:43:18] natural that a woman that a woman could
[1:43:20] go and she could call
[1:43:22] she could call for a lot of things that
[1:43:23] they man how in the world am I ever
[1:43:25] going to get a pineapple at two o'clock
[1:43:27] in the morning for this sister how in
[1:43:29] the world am I going to get that for her
[1:43:31] what is it it's something on the inside
[1:43:33] of her that is making her draw for that
[1:43:36] it's a life on the inside of it and to
[1:43:38] think that Mary back there when when
[1:43:41] Gabriel was speaking to her that she
[1:43:43] began to eat the Lord Jesus Christ's
[1:43:45] body right out of this Earth and watch
[1:43:47] what you begin to eat on you didn't just
[1:43:50] eat on some carry-on you begin to eat on
[1:43:53] Eagle anointing you begin to eat on the
[1:43:55] eagle manner you couldn't handle just
[1:43:58] some some dead carry on you had to have
[1:44:00] fresh Manna what is it it's showing you
[1:44:03] that there's life there's something on
[1:44:06] the inside and it's working on the
[1:44:08] outside it's calling I've got to have
[1:44:10] more I gotta have more I've gotta have
[1:44:14] more it's showing us a life that is
[1:44:18] calling for it
[1:44:20] foreign
[1:44:24] the Holy Ghost is yours the lamb has
[1:44:26] declared that you're his the land of the
[1:44:29] Holy Ghost is yours the land of healing
[1:44:31] is yours the land of Miracles is yours
[1:44:33] the lands of signs and wonders are yours
[1:44:36] the land of a right mind is yours the
[1:44:38] land of perfect healing is yours the
[1:44:41] title deed of redemption says it's yours
[1:44:45] you're anointed
[1:44:48] to accept it
[1:44:50] laughs I think that you're anointed
[1:44:53] by accepting what Eve turned out
[1:44:57] she turned down perfect peace
[1:45:00] she turned down a perfect Eden
[1:45:02] she turned down the word she turned down
[1:45:05] Supreme control she turned down rights
[1:45:07] to the tree of life she turned down
[1:45:10] walking and fellowshipping with the
[1:45:12] father in the cool of the Eden in the
[1:45:14] cool of the evening to think that she
[1:45:16] turned us down she turned down Adam
[1:45:19] being able to speak to creation and
[1:45:21] creation listen to it she turned down
[1:45:24] turned down spiritual multiplication she
[1:45:27] turned down all of these things
[1:45:29] but you're anointed by accepting what
[1:45:31] Eve turned out that means you have the
[1:45:35] power to call creation under its control
[1:45:38] by the master of the Wind
[1:45:43] now watch
[1:45:46] I want to change change gears just for a
[1:45:49] moment
[1:45:53] let me let me just drop this right here
[1:45:58] there's a lot of people and I'm going to
[1:46:00] read this quote but I want to preface it
[1:46:03] with this
[1:46:05] there's a lot of people that don't
[1:46:06] understand
[1:46:08] shouts
[1:46:10] there's a lot of people that don't
[1:46:11] understand
[1:46:13] there's a lot of people that don't
[1:46:14] understand dancing in the spirit
[1:46:16] there's a lot of people that don't
[1:46:17] understand they don't understand
[1:46:19] speaking in tongues or prophesying they
[1:46:21] don't understand that
[1:46:24] but I want to teach you
[1:46:27] that that is the blessings of the Lord
[1:46:32] now now it isn't necessarily anointing
[1:46:34] but it is the blessings of the Lord
[1:46:37] you think that the reason
[1:46:41] the reason why
[1:46:44] the children of God are moving where
[1:46:45] they're moving is is because there's
[1:46:47] anointing there
[1:46:50] and they're shouting the way they're
[1:46:51] shouting is because the anointing has
[1:46:54] came
[1:46:54] now a lot of people mix that up and I'm
[1:46:56] going to read this to you so you
[1:46:58] understand what I'm saying is there's a
[1:46:59] lot of people that think that that is
[1:47:01] when the anointing is there the
[1:47:03] anointing had already struck
[1:47:04] and then the blessings came behind it
[1:47:08] as I already told you there was a
[1:47:09] healing angel that stood here that stood
[1:47:11] right here at the platform and that same
[1:47:13] healing Angel is here this morning and
[1:47:15] he and he's still healing and he's still
[1:47:17] moving there is an anointing that is
[1:47:19] here but watch what brother random and I
[1:47:22] know it's just a little bit lengthy but
[1:47:23] I want to I want to lay these things to
[1:47:25] you but he said now he said he said it

[1:48:57] from you go home and be well he said you
[1:49:00] see what it is it's faith
[1:49:05] the anointing's there but it's the
[1:49:07] children's faith that brings the miracle
[1:49:10] from Hathaway he said if you can believe
[1:49:11] it do you believe it he said you see
[1:49:13] those people out there no prayer cards
[1:49:15] or nothing he said are you ready to
[1:49:17] believe is that the way the Lord Jesus
[1:49:19] did when he was here on Earth he said
[1:49:21] here is this one man come all right you
[1:49:23] don't know you don't know what that does
[1:49:25] to you all to the Branham Tabernacle he
[1:49:28] said now just look at here on the top of
[1:49:30] my hand he said you know I don't get
[1:49:31] like that what is it it's the spirit of
[1:49:33] the lord it's anointing he said but many
[1:49:36] people don't understand what anointing
[1:49:38] means
[1:49:39] he said they think it means to shout he
[1:49:42] said that's Joy he said but power comes
[1:49:45] solemn that's the joy of the Lord he
[1:49:48] said this
[1:49:49] what he was doing what he was Discerning
[1:49:51] of people's heart he said this is the
[1:49:53] power of the lord it's healing and
[1:49:56] making whale and why are people so
[1:49:58] tossed about he said some people gets
[1:50:00] the wrong impression of what the
[1:50:02] anointing is he said did you ever think
[1:50:04] of that he said when was the greatest
[1:50:06] anointing ever give to anyone and what
[1:50:09] did they do when they had the anointing
[1:50:11] he said the greatest anointing that
[1:50:13] there ever was to give anyone was Jesus
[1:50:16] Christ he said we have the same Spirit
[1:50:18] by measure he had it without Messer and
[1:50:21] he said one day he entered into the
[1:50:22] temple and picked up the scroll and read
[1:50:25] and said the spirit of the Lord is upon
[1:50:27] me for he's anointed me to preach the
[1:50:29] acceptable year of the Lord to bind up
[1:50:31] the broken hearts to heal the sick to
[1:50:34] give sight to the Blind and now we want
[1:50:36] to think if such an anointing was on him
[1:50:40] that had been prophesied 800 years
[1:50:42] before that it would come and here he
[1:50:45] was with that type of anointing upon him
[1:50:47] the full blessing of the anointing of
[1:50:49] the Lord upon him we would want to run
[1:50:52] all over the building and scream and
[1:50:53] hung her but the Bible said he laid down
[1:50:56] the scroll and sat down precious words
[1:50:59] and proceeded from his mouth that's what
[1:51:01] he's done under the anointing the
[1:51:03] anointing is not emotions
[1:51:06] the anointing is supreme power in
[1:51:09] control like knowing exactly what and
[1:51:12] how and that's what's here
[1:51:14] you watch you watch these people that
[1:51:17] are moving under the anointing now I
[1:51:19] know the devil thinks I Don't Dance
[1:51:20] myself in the corner but the reason why
[1:51:23] you're dancing and the reason why
[1:51:25] there's joy is because there's a shout
[1:51:27] there's an anointing that has caused the
[1:51:30] shout these people ain't shouting and
[1:51:33] these people ain't dancing because
[1:51:34] they've lost their mind they've found
[1:51:36] their anointing they anointed set them
[1:51:39] free they anoint and made them who they
[1:51:41] are in Christ
[1:51:44] the anointing is supreme power in
[1:51:47] control
[1:51:50] the anointing a supreme power
[1:51:54] not out of control
[1:51:56] but in control
[1:52:00] let me give you an example the maniac in
[1:52:03] Portland
[1:52:05] it had been in a natural brother Bynum
[1:52:09] brother Bynum was a boxer and they never
[1:52:12] lost he never lost one one boxing match
[1:52:16] I'll tell y'all something when I was in
[1:52:18] seventh grade they asked us who was the
[1:52:20] greatest boxer of all time
[1:52:23] they was looking for Muhammad Ali and I
[1:52:25] wrote down William Bradham
[1:52:28] a message from my head and all the way
[1:52:29] to my toes
[1:52:34] he lost the battle surely surely in his
[1:52:37] flesh I can handle this but this man had
[1:52:40] done beat up preachers in a dumb brother
[1:52:42] them broke up that broke up meetings
[1:52:44] time and time again what was it it was a
[1:52:47] devil that was anointing that man to
[1:52:49] break up services and cause a
[1:52:51] distraction in the middle of the service
[1:52:53] and that man was standing there and he
[1:52:56] said he's going to break every bone
[1:52:57] named William branham's body but William
[1:52:59] Branham what did he do he said tonight
[1:53:01] you will fall over my feet he said I'll
[1:53:05] show you whose feet I'll fall over who's
[1:53:06] going to fall over who and he come at
[1:53:09] him and brother random said come out of
[1:53:10] the man Satan and he fell on William
[1:53:12] bradham's feet pinned his feet to the
[1:53:15] floor it was a worship of that demon
[1:53:18] that was causing that man to act that
[1:53:20] way William Branham said could you roll
[1:53:22] him off of my feet he said as I was
[1:53:25] saying faith is the substance of things
[1:53:27] hoped for he said that chief of tribe of
[1:53:30] demons had challenged the spirit of the
[1:53:32] Living God and he lost the challenge and
[1:53:34] there was Miracle after Miracle people
[1:53:37] getting out of wheelchairs because the
[1:53:39] anointing was in Supreme control
[1:53:42] telling you that that anointing is here
[1:53:44] and it's in control of a body it's time
[1:53:47] you control the storms control cancer
[1:53:52] control the atmosphere make known for
[1:53:55] your request unto the Lord ask and you
[1:53:58] shall be given knocking it shall be
[1:54:01] opened unto you
[1:54:08] I got a testimony this morning brother
[1:54:10] Andy have a brother brother Ronnie long
[1:54:12] that's preached here he was out in
[1:54:14] Oklahoma last week and there was a
[1:54:16] sister there was a sister that had been
[1:54:18] diagnosed with breast cancer brother
[1:54:20] Ronnie prayed for her she went through
[1:54:22] all kinds of immunotherapy and all kinds
[1:54:25] of ordeals of treatments and those
[1:54:27] sayings and she said when I first got
[1:54:29] diagnosed with that she said I said I
[1:54:32] said this who does Satan think he's
[1:54:34] messing with
[1:54:36] she said I didn't go forth asking I went
[1:54:38] forth confessing my healing and she said
[1:54:41] when when brother Ronnie was there and
[1:54:43] he prayed for me she said I just
[1:54:45] believed it I went home and turned on a
[1:54:47] tape I believe the tape was expectations
[1:54:49] that she was listening to and William
[1:54:51] Brandon was Discerning a person's heart
[1:54:52] and said you've got a tumor but the
[1:54:54] tumor is gone now and she fell where
[1:54:57] that tumor was and it was completely
[1:54:59] gone I'm telling you that there was an
[1:55:01] anointing in this message to drive out
[1:55:04] cancer drive out every disease and there
[1:55:07] is an anointing not just for the flesh
[1:55:09] but there's an anointing for the soul to
[1:55:11] take you right into the coming of the
[1:55:13] Lord make you live right make you talk
[1:55:16] right make you act right and one of
[1:55:18] these mornings you're going to change
[1:55:20] because the anointing
[1:55:27] foreign
[1:55:33] tell him
[1:55:34] control
[1:55:36] the atmospheres
[1:55:38] telling him that was there had his back
[1:55:40] turned to the tent
[1:55:42] it was Elohim that was there to platform
[1:55:46] would speak this to us
[1:55:49] and they would say he said now he said
[1:55:52] if that angel came from heaven
[1:55:54] and stood behind this Pulpit he said or
[1:55:57] stood right here he said which one has
[1:55:59] more power now think if an angel from
[1:56:03] heaven that knows no sin
[1:56:05] that knows no sickness that knows no
[1:56:08] troubles if he'd come all the way from
[1:56:10] heaven and he would stand right here
[1:56:13] he said which one would have more power
[1:56:15] that angel or the angel behind the
[1:56:17] pulpit
[1:56:19] come on somebody I'm preaching to you
[1:56:22] this morning to think that William
[1:56:24] Beckham said he said it's the angel
[1:56:26] behind the pulpit that's got more power
[1:56:28] that's got more anointing to think that
[1:56:31] angel ain't got no clue about Sin but
[1:56:33] I'm standing here and I am a sinner
[1:56:35] saved by the grace of God I know what
[1:56:37] it's like to be redeemed I know what
[1:56:40] it's like to watch healing come I know
[1:56:42] what it's like to watch Deliverance come

[1:56:46] authority of this office and I'm
[1:56:47] commanding sickness take your leave

[1:59:32] there's no man who can tell you this he
[1:59:34] sings the angel knows how to operate
[1:59:36] into Supreme control
[1:59:39] and you might think the things that have
[1:59:40] been spoken and the things have been
[1:59:42] prophesied are way too hard let me tell
[1:59:44] you ain't nothing too hard for our God
[1:59:48] I'm not scared of one prodigal being
[1:59:51] left behind I'm not scared of one sick
[1:59:53] person being left here not healed I'm
[1:59:55] not scared about what the devil can
[1:59:57] whisper in our ears that we won't that
[1:59:59] we won't make it but the Bible said that
[2:00:01] we would be there with our Offspring
[2:00:03] also and you are their offspring and
[2:00:05] they will be there I'm speaking to you
[2:00:07] according to the word that you are the
[2:00:10] final runners you're anointed to run
[2:00:13] your anointed to finish
[2:00:16] there was a whole gang of Believers that
[2:00:18] went on before us but you're going to
[2:00:19] run their last Mile and you ain't just
[2:00:21] going to barely make it they're going to
[2:00:23] run all the way home

[2:00:40] know about my Ministry no Annie I don't
[2:00:42] know honey don't know nothing about that
[2:00:43] Ministry but I believe that Jesus is
[2:00:46] coming by my way
[2:00:48] if you could do it for a little girl in
[2:00:50] Memphis if you could do it for a blind
[2:00:52] girl the heck cataracts on her ass what
[2:00:54] about you this morning what about your
[2:00:56] problem
[2:01:00] God and Shook Up
[2:01:04] you are his lesser lights reflecting his
[2:01:07] power reflecting his word reflecting his
[2:01:10] truth
[2:01:13] and that same one that turned on the
[2:01:15] light is here
[2:01:23] I tell you my house
[2:01:26] then a day gone by my girls ain't got
[2:01:29] every light in the house on
[2:01:33] every man can attest to what I'm saying
[2:01:35] right here you go through your house and
[2:01:37] click the lights off before you leave
[2:01:41] amen
[2:01:43] it's just a flick of a button
[2:01:45] now if I'm the man that goes through
[2:01:47] there and turns it off
[2:01:50] I'm the man that could go in there and
[2:01:51] turn it on
[2:01:52] and Satan's tried to come in and turn
[2:01:54] your light off in your life but there's
[2:01:56] a man to come by
[2:02:00] barely making it
[2:02:02] barely get by struggling
[2:02:10] you don't don't think I'm off basis
[2:02:11] right here
[2:02:13] you watch what William Branham does in
[2:02:14] the in the in the seals you watch as he
[2:02:17] comes down through every seal he said
[2:02:19] now my revelation of this is watch what
[2:02:22] the angel was teaching him he takes him
[2:02:24] down through her he said my revelation
[2:02:26] of this seal is go listen just type it
[2:02:29] in you'll find it
[2:02:30] but it comes to the southern seal and he
[2:02:33] said my revelation of the seventh seal
[2:02:35] is
[2:02:37] and he goes on talking about his
[2:02:39] ministry
[2:02:46] do you mean to tell me
[2:02:47] that Malachi 4's Ministry has a part of
[2:02:51] the seventh seal amen
[2:02:54] to think that this is a time when
[2:02:57] struggling is over that this is a time
[2:03:00] where this is a time when that when's
[2:03:02] talents when the Silence has gone forth
[2:03:04] that the time is at hand that
[2:03:06] strugglings are coming to an end that
[2:03:08] troubles are coming to an end and you're
[2:03:10] sitting here
[2:03:11] enter the breaking of the seventh seal
[2:03:14] and you're under the greatest ministry
[2:03:16] that's ever been pronounced throughout
[2:03:18] the worlds it's across the world and
[2:03:20] you're under this anointing a Malachi 4
[2:03:23] and to think that you're going to make
[2:03:25] it
[2:03:27] you're gonna win
[2:03:31] if I was you I'd just start praising the
[2:03:33] Lord for your healing I'd start praising
[2:03:35] the Lord for your breakthrough I'd start
[2:03:36] praising the Lord I'm gonna make it I'm
[2:03:39] going to win I'm going in a Rapture I'm
[2:03:41] going to have a testimony
[2:03:45] let the musicians come we are accepting
[2:03:48] the impossible as possible we're
[2:03:50] accepting there's an Angel that's going
[2:03:52] to watch over us we're accepting
[2:03:55] just save the Lord
[2:04:01] anointed by accepting what Eve turned
[2:04:04] down
[2:04:07] just go read the rest of the quote
[2:04:11] he said she will be a token to the world
[2:04:14] that she is not like Eve in the
[2:04:17] beginning
[2:04:18] that Eve fell in the beginning but this
[2:04:21] Eve is predestinated and ordained not to
[2:04:25] fail
[2:04:31] I know some of you got some bad days
[2:04:33] I know some of you get under under some
[2:04:35] mighty heavy things
[2:04:38] start quoting the word to it
[2:04:42] you're never going to whip the devil
[2:04:44] with your own tongue
[2:04:47] you're going to have to start putting
[2:04:48] thus save the Lord on your mouth
[2:04:51] and there's some battles you're going to
[2:04:53] face here that you can't help
[2:04:55] there's going to be some things that you
[2:04:57] can't overcome on your own
[2:04:58] but he's big enough
[2:05:02] Pharaoh's magic wasn't strong enough
[2:05:04] to cancel out Moses is Rod
[2:05:07] and Satan's magic is not strong enough
[2:05:09] the cancer out the power of this word
[2:05:13] [Music]
[2:05:15] I'm standing
[2:05:18] with a body of believers
[2:05:21] I was thinking about it this morning I
[2:05:23] think about you Sister Mary I think
[2:05:26] you know we got a little bit of distance
[2:05:28] between our last names if things go like
[2:05:30] they are in heaven how they are here at
[2:05:33] school you get your last name you call
[2:05:35] it at the very end
[2:05:36] we'll be pretty close by the gym
