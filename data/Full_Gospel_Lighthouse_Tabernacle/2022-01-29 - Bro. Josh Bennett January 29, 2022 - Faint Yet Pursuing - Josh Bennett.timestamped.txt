[27:00] evening god bless each and every one of
[27:02] you
[27:54] i could before i sing while he's getting
[27:56] ready
[27:57] um i wrote this song a while back and we
[28:00] recorded it and the whole time i was
[28:02] recording it i thought about
[28:04] your pastor brother ron and i wanted to
[28:07] send him a copy of the song
[28:09] after we recorded it
[28:11] but
[28:12] i was embarrassed and shy and i thought
[28:15] he doesn't even know who i am
[28:17] and that would just be embarrassing so i
[28:19] never sent it to him even though i
[28:21] really wanted to so fast forward to
[28:24] last may
[28:25] um i got really sick
[28:28] and
[28:29] i had one thing after another and the
[28:31] doctors couldn't figure out what was
[28:33] wrong
[28:34] and i had many really really bad days
[28:37] um one sunday morning
[28:39] when i was probably having one of the
[28:40] worst days that i had had my brother
[28:43] came to me
[28:45] and said he wanted to tell me about a
[28:46] dream that he had had
[28:48] he said way back maybe in april maybe
[28:52] but it was before i even got sick
[28:54] he had a dream and in his dream
[28:57] he was somewhere maybe at some meetings
[28:58] and brother ron came up
[29:01] and started talking to him and he had
[29:03] never in real life he never talked to
[29:05] him before so he was
[29:06] it was a neat dream for him but anyway
[29:08] brother ron said i just wanted to tell
[29:10] you that your is healed
[29:15] so my brother thought that was very odd
[29:17] because he did i wasn't even sick
[29:20] but um
[29:21] so so that morning when he told me about
[29:23] the dream um it was like this burst of
[29:26] faith came over me
[29:27] and um i said why didn't you tell me
[29:29] this before and he said well i was just
[29:31] waiting for the right time and it really
[29:32] was the right time because
[29:34] i'm right that was my turning point
[29:36] right after that i got the faith that i
[29:38] needed um the doctors found the problem
[29:41] and my healing began
[29:42] and um
[29:44] so then i knew i had to send that song
[29:45] to brother ron no matter how
[29:47] embarrassing or shy i was
[29:49] so um
[29:51] he had asked me saying this the last
[29:52] time we were here but i couldn't so i'm
[29:54] going to try it today but
[29:56] i just want to say miracles happen and
[29:58] when they do it's an amazing thing
[30:00] but but sometimes our calling is
[30:02] actually just to be healed it's to go
[30:05] through that healing process and it
[30:07] builds our faith and so i hope this will
[30:09] be a blessing to you
[30:14] they say it just takes time
[30:19] and healing's
[30:21] come
[30:25] but they don't
[30:27] know i'm on
[30:30] the verge of giving up
[30:36] i try
[30:37] to be strong
[30:40] saying lord your will
[30:43] be done
[30:44] but inside i'm crying
[30:48] lord
[30:51] [Music]
[30:59] [Music]
[31:01] oh but i will just
[31:04] believe
[31:07] for healing
[31:10] [Music]
[31:12] you have promised me
[31:17] and i know it won't be
[31:20] long
[31:22] just let my faith stay strong
[31:28] and i will love you
[31:31] through all
[31:33] of my healing
[31:35] [Music]
[31:39] now
[31:40] miracles bring hope
[31:44] to others when
[31:47] they see
[31:49] but in your time
[31:51] and in your healing
[31:55] you're building
[31:57] faith in me
[32:01] and i know
[32:02] you're right here
[32:05] though some days are hard to see
[32:09] i don't need an
[32:12] angel lord
[32:15] stirring the waters just for
[32:19] me
[32:21] for my healing
[32:26] lord i will just
[32:29] believe
[32:32] for healing
[32:33] [Music]
[32:37] you have promised me
[32:42] and i know it won't be
[32:45] long
[32:47] just let my faith stay strong
[32:52] and i will love you
[32:55] [Music]
[33:02] and if tomorrow finds me
[33:06] gone
[33:07] i'll just be standing by your
[33:11] throne
[33:16] and i will love you
[33:19] through all
[33:21] of my
[33:28] [Music]

[34:28] fighting

[48:10] of the book of judges i'm just going to
[48:12] read one verse of scripture but if you
[48:14] don't mind just keep your your bibles
[48:16] handy and
[48:18] judges chapter 8 and i'm just going to
[48:22] read from the fourth verse
[48:29] and gideon came to jordan
[48:32] and passed over he
[48:35] and the 300 men that were with him
[48:38] faint
[48:39] yet pursuing them
[48:42] may the lord just add his blessing to
[48:43] the reading of the word and you can have
[48:45] your seats tonight
[48:59] i want to just speak for a few minutes
[49:01] on faint yet pursuing
[49:05] i'd like to uh just read a a quote out
[49:08] of the message of thanking men's filter
[49:10] just
[49:11] just as we get started tonight
[49:14] and the prophet said he said church i
[49:16] realize i've got to stand with you in
[49:18] the judgment someday
[49:20] he said far be it for me to ever tell
[49:22] you anything wrong
[49:24] for popularity i don't want to do that
[49:26] if i had my desire i just my human
[49:29] desire i'd take my rifle and go out in
[49:31] the woods and build a cabin
[49:33] and just trap the rest of my life
[49:35] see i'm getting old tired weary
[49:39] broke down
[49:40] but i can't quit
[49:43] there's just something in me grinding
[49:46] he said woe unto me if i don't tell the
[49:49] truth and the whole truth woe unto me if
[49:51] i don't stand here till the last breath
[49:53] of my body has left me
[49:56] i must stand regardless of what anyone
[49:59] else says because i'm responsible before
[50:01] god
[50:03] amen i i believe i'm so thankful i'm
[50:06] thankful that the prophet didn't just go
[50:08] do what he wanted to do
[50:11] i'm glad that he didn't just go fulfill
[50:12] his own human desire
[50:15] but there was a call in his life there
[50:17] was something that was greater than his
[50:18] own desire
[50:20] and he said even when he was tired broke
[50:23] down weary he said i just can't quit
[50:26] amen because there was something driving
[50:28] him there was something greater than
[50:29] what he was
[50:31] even that was driving him and he said
[50:33] whoa unto me if i don't i thought about
[50:35] paul when paul said woe unto me amen if
[50:38] i don't preach the gospel amen there's a
[50:40] lot of people would love to shut up
[50:43] every preacher but amen there's some
[50:45] preachers that just can't be shut up
[50:48] amen amen and i believe there's some men
[50:50] there stand like paul and men that stand
[50:53] like william branham that just won't
[50:55] quit
[50:56] i love what brother brown said there he
[50:57] said i'm gonna stand amen until the last
[51:01] breath leaves my body
[51:02] regardless of what anybody else thinks
[51:05] about it
[51:06] amen but just to get a background of the
[51:09] text that we find tonight
[51:11] and the book of judges there i'd like to
[51:13] just go back and look in judges chapter
[51:15] six
[51:16] judges i know this is very familiar and
[51:19] and it's going to be real simple tonight
[51:20] but you know what i found that uh god is
[51:23] hid in simplicity
[51:25] and you know i i think sometimes if you
[51:28] uh there really ain't nothing new to
[51:29] preach
[51:30] and and i know you pastor y'all heard
[51:32] that some of the best preaching that's
[51:34] ever been done
[51:36] amen amen so i don't have nothing new to
[51:39] bring you tonight but i am here to stir
[51:40] up your minds amen tonight by way of
[51:43] remembrance
[51:45] and so in the book of judges there in
[51:47] the sixth chapter the bible says and the
[51:49] children of israel did evil in the sight
[51:50] of the lord and the lord delivered
[51:53] them into the hand of media for seven
[51:55] years
[51:56] and the hand of media prevailed against
[51:58] israel because of the midianites the
[52:00] children of israel made them dens which
[52:02] are in the mountains and caves and
[52:04] strongholds
[52:06] and it was so when israel had sown that
[52:08] the midianites came and the amla kites
[52:10] and the children of the of the east even
[52:13] they came up against them and they
[52:15] encamped against them and destroyed the
[52:17] increase of the earth till thou come
[52:19] unto gaza and left no substance for
[52:22] israel neither sheep nor ox nor ass for
[52:25] they came up with their cattle and their
[52:27] tents and they came as grasshoppers for
[52:30] multitude for both they and their camels
[52:32] were outnumbered and they entered into
[52:35] the land to destroy it and israel was
[52:36] greatly impoverished because of the
[52:39] midianites and the children of israel
[52:40] cried unto the lord and it came to pass
[52:43] that when the children of israel cried
[52:44] unto the lord because of the midianites
[52:46] that the lord sent a prophet
[52:48] amen i love that when the children of
[52:50] israel began to cry god sent him a
[52:53] prophet
[52:54] and and the prophet said thus saith the
[52:56] lord god of israel i brought you up from
[52:59] egypt and brought you forth out of the
[53:00] house of bondage and delivered you out
[53:03] of the hand of the egyptians and out of
[53:04] the hand of all that oppressed you and
[53:06] drove you from out from before you and
[53:09] gave you their land and i said unto you
[53:11] i am the lord your god fear not the gods
[53:13] of the amorites and whose land you dwell
[53:16] but you have not obeyed my voice and
[53:19] there came an angel of the lord and said
[53:21] under an oak which was an orphan
[53:23] and that pertained to joash
[53:26] and his son gideon thresh wheat by the
[53:28] wine press to hide it from the
[53:29] midianites and the angel of the lord
[53:31] appeared unto him
[53:33] and said unto him the lord is with thee
[53:36] thou thou mighty man of valor amen i
[53:39] love that because when the angel
[53:40] appeared unto him the angel told him who
[53:43] he was
[53:44] and called him a mighty man of valor
[53:46] notice what the prophet said
[53:48] he said
[53:49] now we find out that when god's people
[53:52] gets in trouble
[53:53] god always sends them a prophet with the
[53:56] true word to bring them out
[53:59] amen how many glad god sent us a prophet
[54:02] amen how many would acknowledge that we
[54:03] were in a mess
[54:05] amen religion was in a mess this world
[54:08] was in a mess but thank god he sent a
[54:11] prophet
[54:12] amen a prophet with a word to bring us
[54:14] out
[54:16] amen brother brown said and here come a
[54:18] prophet out for the hour and gave them
[54:20] the word of the lord and remember he
[54:21] never gave them some man-made theology
[54:24] he said i'm the lord that brought you
[54:25] out of egypt
[54:27] i'm the one that showed you my mighty
[54:28] hand show my power and i could just
[54:30] imagine gideon was getting right there
[54:32] he was just he was right there listening
[54:34] at him and he said i'm the god that did
[54:36] all these things and i've done all this
[54:38] for you and yet you've not obeyed my
[54:40] commandments and in all this you have
[54:42] not done it and i want you to notice
[54:44] another thing that might encourage you
[54:46] immediately after the prophet's message
[54:48] the lord appeared on the scene
[54:50] he said amen as soon as he gave his
[54:53] message the lord appeared under a tree
[54:55] and the lord came after the message of
[54:58] the prophet see the people fell away and
[55:00] got off in their isms and god sent his
[55:03] prophet and as soon as the prophet got
[55:05] through with his message the lord
[55:07] followed the prophet's message for
[55:09] deliverance
[55:10] oh we're living in a grand time
[55:12] immediately when the prophet went off
[55:14] the scene what happened the lord came on
[55:16] the scene
[55:17] as soon as john went off the scene the
[55:19] lord come on the scene
[55:21] amen how many can see the parallel
[55:23] tonight how many thankful that god sent
[55:25] us a prophet
[55:27] he gave us a message
[55:29] amen but according to what that prophet
[55:31] said as soon as the prophet went off the
[55:33] scene the lord came on the scene
[55:36] listen church the prophet ain't here
[55:37] tonight but i got good news
[55:40] jesus christ is here tonight
[55:44] hallelujah amen the lord came behind the
[55:48] prophet's message
[55:50] for deliverance
[55:52] and i believe he's here tonight
[55:54] amen we read in the scripture we're
[55:56] gideon he was scared out there by the
[55:58] wine press threshing out enough wheat
[56:00] before the philistines or the midianites
[56:03] amen there and him and he was out there
[56:05] getting like a little uh grub for the
[56:07] winter's food thrashing it out secretly
[56:09] so they couldn't find them because they
[56:11] laying like grasshoppers for
[56:13] multitude but now gideon when when he's
[56:15] out there threshing his weak no doubt
[56:17] that prophet's message was just going
[56:19] through his heart
[56:21] what the prophet had said i like that
[56:23] amen while getting was out there
[56:25] threshing amen the prophet's message was
[56:28] running through his heart he meant he
[56:30] was thinking about something he wasn't
[56:32] thinking about politics he he wasn't so
[56:34] worried about what you know the
[56:35] president said he was thinking about
[56:37] what the prophet has said
[56:39] amen there was something running through
[56:40] his heart as he was threshing the wheat
[56:42] there amen that prophet had said i am
[56:44] the god of abraham isaac and of jacob
[56:47] i'm the one that brought you out of
[56:49] egypt i'm the one amen that gave you
[56:51] what you got turn to me see amen out
[56:54] there threshing the wheat and the angel
[56:56] come to him it was god himself see
[56:58] because it was a capital l o r d c
[57:01] he said and he spoke to gideon and
[57:03] gideon was a little bit surprised
[57:05] he said now you mighty man of valor see
[57:08] he didn't know he was
[57:11] and maybe you don't know you are
[57:14] amen amen i love that he said gideon
[57:17] didn't know he was a mighty man of valor
[57:20] amen and maybe you don't know who you
[57:22] are
[57:23] amen but that's why god sent an a
[57:26] message to him to tell him who he was
[57:31] hallelujah
[57:33] amen and the bible says that gideon said
[57:35] unto him oh my lord
[57:37] if the lord be with us
[57:39] then why
[57:40] then is this befalling us
[57:42] and where be all the miracles which our
[57:44] father told us of saying did not the
[57:47] lord bring us up from egypt but now the
[57:49] lord hath forsaken us and delivered us
[57:52] into the hands of the midianites
[57:55] see i i don't think that gideon was
[57:57] necessarily judging god foolish
[58:00] amen but i believe he had a sincere
[58:02] question in his heart
[58:04] brother banham said it this way he said
[58:06] gideon said if god be with us then
[58:08] where's all his mighty miracles
[58:10] see the prophet told us amen he was a
[58:13] god that brought us out of egypt and
[58:15] smote the land and deliver to them and
[58:17] he's a god of deliverance and if he ever
[58:20] was god
[58:22] he's still god
[58:25] hallelujah and i say the same thing
[58:27] tonight if he ever was god
[58:30] he has to always remain god
[58:33] if he ever was almighty he's still
[58:36] almighty
[58:37] he certainly is the bible said he's the
[58:39] same yesterday today and forever
[58:43] how many can say amen to that tonight
[58:45] amen and let me just say this amen if
[58:47] god was ever god he's still god right
[58:50] now
[58:51] and if he ever healed he still heals
[58:53] right now
[58:54] if he ever give the holy ghost he's
[58:56] still doing it right now the prophet of
[58:58] god said what he did he will continue to
[59:00] do until the end of the age amen because
[59:03] he is the same yesterday today and
[59:05] forever
[59:06] [Applause]
[59:08] hallelujah
[59:09] amen now watch gideon says
[59:12] here in uh or i'm sorry in the in the
[59:14] 14th verse and the lord looked upon him
[59:16] and said go in this thy might
[59:18] and thou shalt save israel from the hand
[59:21] of the many nights have i not sent thee
[59:23] and he said unto him oh my lord
[59:25] wherewith shall i save israel behold my
[59:27] family is poor in manasseh and i'm the
[59:30] least in my father's house you know
[59:31] gideon was just like every other man he
[59:34] had all the excuses of why he couldn't
[59:35] do it
[59:37] you know he was just like moses i can't
[59:39] even speak and amen he was just like
[59:41] everybody else amen he had all the
[59:43] reasons figured out why he couldn't be
[59:45] the one even to fulfill the word
[59:48] amen but listen amen he said unto him if
[59:52] if i have found grace in thy sight then
[59:55] show me a sign
[59:57] i'm sorry amen i skipped a verse in
[59:59] verse 16 and the lord said unto him
[1:00:02] surely i will be with thee
[1:00:05] and thou shalt smite the midianites as
[1:00:08] one man
[1:00:09] amen i believe that god was telling
[1:00:12] telling gideon i know you're poor i know
[1:00:15] you're the least in your father's house
[1:00:17] i know you ain't got no ability amen i
[1:00:20] don't need your ability
[1:00:23] hallelujah listen church god don't need
[1:00:26] your
[1:00:26] abilities god don't need great people
[1:00:30] amen god needs somebody he can get in
[1:00:32] his hand
[1:00:33] god needs somebody humble enough amen
[1:00:35] that can surrender their life to him and
[1:00:38] let him take over amen because let me
[1:00:40] tell you it wasn't gideon that was going
[1:00:42] to win the victory it was god almighty
[1:00:45] that was going to win the victory
[1:00:47] church i'm going to tell you this
[1:00:48] tonight amen if we make it out of here
[1:00:51] and we are it ain't going to be by our
[1:00:53] ability it ain't gonna be because how
[1:00:56] great we are it'll be by the grace of
[1:00:59] almighty god
[1:01:02] hallelujah not by power not by might but
[1:01:06] by my spirit saith the lord of hosts
[1:01:11] we are what we are by the grace of god
[1:01:16] hallelujah
[1:01:18] amen i believe it with all my heart
[1:01:20] amen and notice this amen god said i'll
[1:01:23] be with thee
[1:01:25] and he said unto him gideon said if i
[1:01:27] found grace and thy sight show a sign
[1:01:29] that thou talketh with me
[1:01:31] depart not thence i pray thee until i
[1:01:34] come unto thee again and bring
[1:01:36] forth my present and set it before thee
[1:01:39] and he said i will tarry until thou come
[1:01:41] again and get him went made ready a kid
[1:01:44] and unleavened cakes
[1:01:46] and he put put flesh in a in a basket he
[1:01:49] uh put
[1:01:50] broth in a pot and brought it in under
[1:01:53] the oak and presented it and the angel
[1:01:55] of god said unto him take the flesh
[1:01:58] and the unleaved cakes and lay them upon
[1:02:00] this rock
[1:02:01] and pour out the broth and he did so
[1:02:04] then the angel of the lord put forth the
[1:02:06] end of the staff that was in his hand
[1:02:08] and touched the flesh
[1:02:10] and the unleavened cakes
[1:02:12] and there rose up a fire out of the rock
[1:02:14] and consumed the flesh and the
[1:02:15] unleavened cakes and the angels of the
[1:02:17] lord departed out of his sight
[1:02:19] now listen what brother brown said about
[1:02:21] that he said gideon after he had seen
[1:02:23] this visitor sitting under the tree
[1:02:26] he kind of questioned him at first
[1:02:29] he said if god still remains god if god
[1:02:31] be with us then where's his miracles

[1:05:50] he that will plead for him let him be
[1:05:53] put to death well as yet mourning
[1:05:55] if he be a god
[1:05:58] let him plead for himself
[1:06:01] because one has cast down his altar
[1:06:04] i think that's a good answer
[1:06:08] amen if baal is god amen let him plead
[1:06:11] his own case
[1:06:13] if he's angry because you cut down and
[1:06:15] tore down his altar amen let him speak
[1:06:18] for himself
[1:06:19] i don't know about the rest of y'all but
[1:06:21] i'm glad i'm serving a god that's got a
[1:06:24] voice
[1:06:26] hallelujah
[1:06:28] i'm glad that god we serve
[1:06:31] complete his own case
[1:06:36] he's not a god that man-made amen he is
[1:06:39] not a god of our creation he's the
[1:06:42] creator
[1:06:45] hallelujah amen he is come on church our
[1:06:48] god is not even depending on no man
[1:06:51] we're depending on him
[1:06:53] kind of puts me in the mind of when the
[1:06:55] ark of the covenant got taken up uh the
[1:06:58] philistines took it amen amen from
[1:07:00] israel and they took it down there and
[1:07:01] you remember you remember they took it
[1:07:03] down and put it before their god
[1:07:06] amen when they remember church i'm going
[1:07:08] to show you the power of the word
[1:07:10] there was nobody there amen in it
[1:07:13] [Music]
[1:07:15] there was no preacher standing there
[1:07:17] amen in agreement with it there was
[1:07:19] nobody saying this is right amen the
[1:07:21] word all by itself
[1:07:24] set before an idol
[1:07:26] brought the idol down
[1:07:28] [Applause]
[1:07:30] and their god fell on his face
[1:07:33] you know what's amazing to me about that
[1:07:35] amen that bunch went out there and
[1:07:38] picked their god up
[1:07:40] [Music]
[1:07:43] could you imagine amen them a bunch of
[1:07:46] crazy people worshiping that and oh god
[1:07:48] they aim and they went in there found
[1:07:50] their god laying on his face
[1:07:52] [Applause]
[1:07:54] and they picked their god up
[1:07:57] and propped him back up
[1:07:59] amen amen but the thing about is is they
[1:08:02] left the word sitting there
[1:08:04] and when they got back the next morning
[1:08:06] their god was laying back down again
[1:08:09] and his face was broke off and his hands
[1:08:11] was broke off
[1:08:15] hallelujah let me tell you something
[1:08:17] tonight church the god i serve
[1:08:20] i have never had to pick him up i have
[1:08:24] never
[1:08:25] had to prop him up
[1:08:27] but my god
[1:08:29] picks me up
[1:08:33] hallelujah
[1:08:35] he's the one that's holding my hand
[1:08:39] i don't have to hold him up i don't have
[1:08:41] to pick him up i don't have to prop him
[1:08:43] up but my god
[1:08:46] hallelujah when i'm sick he heals me
[1:08:50] when i was lost he saved me
[1:08:54] when i was down amen he delivered me
[1:08:57] that's the god i served tonight
[1:09:02] hallelujah it's in your god
[1:09:09] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:09:16] gideon's that gideon's dad said if
[1:09:20] bale's upset
[1:09:21] let him plead his own case
[1:09:25] if he's mad because they cast down his
[1:09:27] altar even let him speak for himself
[1:09:31] the bible said then all the media
[1:09:33] knights
[1:09:34] and the americas and the children of the
[1:09:36] of the east were gathered and went over
[1:09:38] and pitched in the valley of jezreel
[1:09:40] but the spirit of the lord came on
[1:09:42] gideon
[1:09:45] amen the spirit of the lord came on
[1:09:47] gideon
[1:09:48] and he blew the trumpet
[1:09:51] amen
[1:09:52] and he sent messengers throughout all
[1:09:54] manassas and gathered after him and he
[1:09:56] sent messengers unto asher and to
[1:09:59] zebelon and neptulon and they all came
[1:10:01] and met them
[1:10:03] chapter seven and
[1:10:05] and we see here in chapter seven when
[1:10:07] even gideon had sent all out to the
[1:10:09] people that were with him and they rose
[1:10:11] up early and pitched beside the well
[1:10:15] there was a great host that had gathered
[1:10:17] around
[1:10:18] getting in there
[1:10:21] but
[1:10:23] the bible says
[1:10:24] in verse 4 the lord said unto gideon the
[1:10:26] people are yet too many
[1:10:30] i mean you'll find that
[1:10:33] that in verse 2 god said the same thing
[1:10:35] to get him said there was too many
[1:10:39] and gideon said spoke to him and said
[1:10:41] anybody that's fearful go home
[1:10:44] if you ain't got a stomach to fight
[1:10:45] you're in the wrong place
[1:10:47] [Music]
[1:10:49] listen if you ain't ready for war you're
[1:10:50] you're in the wrong place
[1:10:53] if you come for a picnic
[1:10:55] the message pie ain't gonna fit you too
[1:10:57] good
[1:11:00] everybody that was fearful he sent him
[1:11:02] home
[1:11:03] amen but even after that
[1:11:05] god said there's still too many
[1:11:08] he told me he said bring them down to
[1:11:09] the water
[1:11:11] and i'll try them for thee there and it
[1:11:13] shall be that
[1:11:15] of whom i say unto thee this shall go
[1:11:17] with thee the same shall go with thee
[1:11:19] and whosoever i shall say unto thee this
[1:11:22] shall not go with thee the same shall
[1:11:24] not go
[1:11:25] so he brought down the people into the
[1:11:26] water
[1:11:27] and the lord said in the gideon every
[1:11:29] one that lap of the water with his
[1:11:30] tongue as a dog laugh at him shall thou
[1:11:33] sit by himself
[1:11:35] likewise one that bowed down upon his
[1:11:37] knee to drink
[1:11:38] and the number of them that lap lapped
[1:11:40] putting forth their hand to the mouth
[1:11:42] were 300 men but all the rest of the
[1:11:44] people bowed down upon their knees to
[1:11:46] drink water now i got to remind you of
[1:11:48] something the enemy they're facing
[1:11:50] couldn't even be numbered
[1:11:52] according to the bible that they mean
[1:11:54] they were they come as grasshoppers as
[1:11:56] as multitude
[1:11:58] they couldn't even number their cat or
[1:11:59] their camels and
[1:12:01] and all these things amen and so they
[1:12:04] were already outnumbered to begin with
[1:12:08] even in the beginning of the seventh
[1:12:10] chapter the great multitude that gideon
[1:12:13] had they were already outnumbered
[1:12:16] as far as a natural accuracy
[1:12:20] but you see god said there's still too
[1:12:23] many
[1:12:25] and so he put them to the test now they
[1:12:26] ended up with 300 men
[1:12:29] and and and i want you to say this it's
[1:12:31] not always in the numbers
[1:12:35] you know people give the idea that
[1:12:36] strength is in numbers but strength is
[1:12:38] not in numbers
[1:12:40] even there is strength in unity but not
[1:12:43] in numbers
[1:12:45] amen but notice brother brown said amen
[1:12:47] he says
[1:12:49] as we're moving to the top of the
[1:12:50] pyramid we're getting in the minority
[1:12:53] all the time
[1:12:54] so it's getting less and less as far as
[1:12:56] in in numbers is getting less
[1:12:59] but the closer we get to the top in
[1:13:02] power
[1:13:03] the power is getting greater
[1:13:06] do you believe that
[1:13:08] that's why the prophet said give me a
[1:13:09] church just give me ten men
[1:13:12] who are really jewels of god
[1:13:14] the royal seed them men put together and
[1:13:17] i and watch what'll take place
[1:13:19] just give me a little house full of
[1:13:21] people like that and i'll show you a
[1:13:22] light that the whole world will run to
[1:13:24] it
[1:13:26] another place brother brown said this
[1:13:27] way he said he said i see there's not a
[1:13:30] year passes but what this great
[1:13:32] supernatural signs is striking the earth
[1:13:34] and we see it knowing that there's a
[1:13:36] great the great army of god marches on
[1:13:38] not many in number but what a powerful
[1:13:41] group
[1:13:42] that's got eternal life said they'll run
[1:13:44] through a troop leap over a wall yes the
[1:13:47] troop of death will have no holders to
[1:13:49] it she'll run right through it leap over
[1:13:51] the wall between the natural and the
[1:13:52] supernatural right under the arms of god
[1:13:56] amen he said that army of god not many
[1:13:59] in number but what a powerful group
[1:14:02] listen i i just want to encourage you
[1:14:04] this tonight amen you say in the last
[1:14:07] you know 10 15 years you said there's a
[1:14:09] lot of people walked away
[1:14:11] amen there's a lot of people walked away
[1:14:13] from the message
[1:14:14] amen but let me just encourage you amen
[1:14:17] listen amen we have not lost anything
[1:14:21] and i'm not trying to be little people
[1:14:23] don't misunderstand what i'm saying but
[1:14:24] we have not lost anything
[1:14:27] we have not lost power
[1:14:30] we have not lost anointing
[1:14:33] come on church this message is just as
[1:14:35] real now i say it's more real
[1:14:40] hallelujah amen and they they come along
[1:14:43] and say it don't work it does work
[1:14:49] hallelujah it is the answer
[1:14:52] come on church
[1:14:54] listen amen i know that men have took
[1:14:56] and made all kind of stuff out of it the
[1:14:58] message is jesus christ
[1:15:01] and it is the answer
[1:15:04] hallelujah
[1:15:06] notice
[1:15:08] as we as we look at this
[1:15:12] as gideon now is
[1:15:14] thin down his group
[1:15:16] the lord begins to give him instruction
[1:15:19] you know and you know the story of how
[1:15:22] that god even encouraged getting in and
[1:15:24] said he said go down there and he said
[1:15:27] just to you know give him a little
[1:15:29] a a little surge of faith
[1:15:32] gideon steps out and he hears
[1:15:35] the enemy
[1:15:36] begins to have a conversation that a man
[1:15:39] begins to tell how he had a dream
[1:15:43] and and the other man begins to say
[1:15:45] given interpretation he said that's
[1:15:47] nothing less than the sword of gideon
[1:15:50] that's that's the hand of god god has
[1:15:52] delivered us amen into the hand of
[1:15:54] gideon
[1:15:56] and gideon when he heard the telling of
[1:15:58] the dream interpretation he worshipped
[1:16:01] and returned to the host of israel and
[1:16:02] said arise for the lord had delivered
[1:16:06] into your hand the host of the median
[1:16:08] and he divided the 300 men into three
[1:16:11] companies and put a trumpet in every
[1:16:13] man's hand and emptied the pictures and
[1:16:14] lamps within the pictures and he said
[1:16:17] unto them look on me and do likewise and
[1:16:19] behold when i come outside the campus
[1:16:21] shall be that as i do shall ye do
[1:16:24] when i blow with a trumpet and
[1:16:26] and and i and all that are with me then
[1:16:29] you then blow you the trumpets also
[1:16:31] every side of the camp and say the sword
[1:16:33] of the lord
[1:16:34] and of gideon
[1:16:36] the sword of the lord
[1:16:38] and of gideon
[1:16:40] and so gideon and the 300 men that were
[1:16:42] with him came outside the camp
[1:16:45] and in the beginning of the middle watch
[1:16:46] they had but newly set the watch and
[1:16:49] they blew the trumpets and broke the
[1:16:50] pictures
[1:16:51] where that were in their hand and the
[1:16:53] 300 companies blew
[1:16:55] the trumpets and broke the pictures and
[1:16:57] held the lamps in their left hands and
[1:16:58] the trump in their right hand in blue
[1:17:00] with all and they cried and they cried
[1:17:02] out the sword of the lord and of gideon
[1:17:06] and they stood every man in his place
[1:17:07] round about the camp and all the hosts
[1:17:10] ran and cried and fled
[1:17:13] and the 300 blew their trumpets and the
[1:17:15] lord said every man soared against his
[1:17:16] fellow even throughout
[1:17:18] all the hosts and the hosts fled
[1:17:21] and notice even as they begin to follow
[1:17:24] gideon's instructions they begin to
[1:17:26] scream out as they as they broke their
[1:17:28] their pictures they begin to scrap the
[1:17:29] sword of the lord and gideon amen that
[1:17:31] they the enemy began to flee
[1:17:35] now i'm just now getting to my text now
[1:17:38] even now amen gideon has got his little
[1:17:41] small narrow down group
[1:17:44] amen
[1:17:45] and and gideon is under the instruction
[1:17:48] amen uh of the chief captain himself
[1:17:53] amen listen friends amen god did this to
[1:17:56] prove to them that they wasn't going to
[1:17:58] win the battle

[1:18:06] he said the reason why you got too many
[1:18:08] i don't want you going down there and
[1:18:09] fighting thinking you did it

[1:19:00] hallelujah

[1:19:04] delivered them
[1:19:06] it was a sword of the lord what did god
[1:19:08] tell israel when he gave him the land
[1:19:10] and sent him into the land he said it's
[1:19:11] not by your arm it's not by your sword
[1:19:14] it's not by your strength amen he said i
[1:19:17] gave you the land

[1:19:24] amen when joshua was going over there
[1:19:26] amen to take jericho amen he met amen

[1:20:58] hallelujah
[1:21:00] and our captain has never
[1:21:04] already hear me tonight he's never
[1:21:07] lost a battle
[1:21:09] not one time
[1:21:11] hallelujah amen and the captain is here
[1:21:14] with the sword in his hand
[1:21:24] glory to god
[1:21:30] well i
[1:21:31] i'm just getting through my text now so
[1:21:32] y'all gonna have to give me a little
[1:21:33] grace
[1:21:34] amen but i was telling brother ron back
[1:21:36] there a while ago i said i remember your
[1:21:38] dad so well
[1:21:39] i went up there years ago brother wayne
[1:21:42] lawson was preaching
[1:21:44] brother charlie patting one i hope this
[1:21:45] is all right he pat him on the back he
[1:21:47] said take your liberty for about one
[1:21:49] hour
[1:21:53] amen so amen i'll be mindful tonight
[1:22:02] but they were
[1:22:04] they had the enemy on the run
[1:22:08] now we come to our text tonight
[1:22:11] and gideon came to jordan passed over he
[1:22:13] and the 300 men that were with him
[1:22:16] faint
[1:22:18] that word faint means exhausted
[1:22:22] it means weary
[1:22:26] faint
[1:22:28] they were tired
[1:22:30] they were worn down
[1:22:33] they've been fighting the battle
[1:22:35] has any of you ever you ever experienced
[1:22:37] that
[1:22:39] have you ever just got tired
[1:22:42] how many they ever got weary
[1:22:45] i mean
[1:22:46] have you ever got so hey man you've been
[1:22:47] in such a battle and you've been
[1:22:49] fighting so long
[1:22:51] and you just get tired
[1:22:54] but allah i'm glad that ain't the end of
[1:22:56] it
[1:22:58] the bible didn't say amen that they were
[1:23:00] faint
[1:23:00] and that was the end of it
[1:23:02] said faint yet pursuing
[1:23:06] even though they were tired they were
[1:23:07] still going
[1:23:10] amen
[1:23:11] look even these 300 men though faint
[1:23:13] they were not faint-hearted
[1:23:15] there's a great difference in being
[1:23:17] faint and being faint-hearted
[1:23:20] if they had been cowards they'd went
[1:23:22] home and gideon said if you're fearful
[1:23:24] going back home to your family
[1:23:26] these 300 men were not cowards
[1:23:29] listen it didn't say anything about any
[1:23:31] of them wanting to quit
[1:23:34] it didn't say nothing about any of them
[1:23:36] wanting to give up
[1:23:38] they didn't say nothing about any of
[1:23:39] them even coming to the spot and you
[1:23:41] know thinking hey hey get in you need to
[1:23:43] call in the backups man
[1:23:45] we've done our part we've pushed the
[1:23:48] enemy back
[1:23:50] we've fought a hard fight we've we've
[1:23:52] exalted ourselves it's time for somebody
[1:23:54] else to take up the cause
[1:23:56] no these 300 men were determined
[1:23:59] to hold their own sword
[1:24:03] until the fight was completely over
[1:24:07] they were determined that they wasn't
[1:24:09] going to quit until they pushed every
[1:24:12] devil
[1:24:13] off of their property
[1:24:16] come on church
[1:24:17] even they are determined within
[1:24:18] themselves listen we might be tired but
[1:24:21] we ain't giving up
[1:24:24] and hey amen we may die trying amen but
[1:24:27] we're gonna aim and we're gonna fight
[1:24:29] nonetheless
[1:24:30] [Applause]
[1:24:31] amen there is no quit in them
[1:24:34] [Applause]
[1:24:36] hallelujah they have purpose in their
[1:24:39] heart we will not turn back
[1:24:42] we will not give in
[1:24:45] we will not give up
[1:24:47] [Applause]
[1:24:48] hallelujah
[1:24:51] i have a word for you
[1:24:53] so where the prophet said
[1:24:55] we have a word for us all at this time
[1:24:58] is hold fast
[1:24:59] [Music]
[1:25:00] persevere
[1:25:02] don't give up
[1:25:04] put on the whole armor of god
[1:25:06] use every weapon he's given us
[1:25:09] use every gift at our disposal look
[1:25:12] ahead with joy because we're going to be
[1:25:14] crowned by him who's our king he's the
[1:25:16] king of kings and the lord of lords
[1:25:18] do you believe that
[1:25:20] church i'm here to encourage you amen if
[1:25:22] you're tired tonight amen amen you might
[1:25:24] be faint but yet pursuant
[1:25:28] because these men were not only pursuing
[1:25:30] the enemy
[1:25:32] but brother andrew they were pursuing
[1:25:33] the will of god
[1:25:36] they were actually fulfilling their
[1:25:39] purpose
[1:25:41] amen
[1:25:42] and as doing so amen it just reminds me
[1:25:45] amen because you know i believe that no
[1:25:47] doubt the bible says they were faint
[1:25:50] even they were tired
[1:25:52] they were wore out
[1:25:54] even and when i began to read this even
[1:25:56] a few months ago i thought man the last
[1:25:58] two years has been a little bit weary
[1:26:02] i mean you know there's been a lot of
[1:26:03] pressure and it seems like every time
[1:26:05] you get a little momentum something else
[1:26:07] will hit and you get a little momentum
[1:26:09] going you know amen something else will
[1:26:10] hit
[1:26:11] amen and it'll kind of wear you down
[1:26:14] can you say amen
[1:26:16] and if you ain't careful you get a
[1:26:18] little discouraged
[1:26:19] [Applause]
[1:26:20] amen but i want to tell you we've come
[1:26:22] too far
[1:26:25] to look back
[1:26:27] we have come too far
[1:26:29] to give up
[1:26:31] church we're too close
[1:26:36] we are too close to the finish line
[1:26:39] to give in now
[1:26:44] i think about david
[1:26:46] first samuel this is real special to us
[1:26:49] because it was actually brother ron was
[1:26:50] using this as a text
[1:26:52] he was dealing with david and his wife
[1:26:54] abigail and
[1:26:56] was real special to my daughter abigail
[1:26:59] but you know david got in that spot
[1:27:02] and
[1:27:03] and he'd come in and
[1:27:05] they'd take you know the enemy had come
[1:27:06] in taken everything
[1:27:08] they'd taken their wives and their
[1:27:10] children taking out all the
[1:27:12] and and they had lost everything but you
[1:27:14] know what the bible says
[1:27:16] that david was greatly distressed
[1:27:18] and and the people actually
[1:27:21] sought to kill david
[1:27:24] david's own people wanted to stone him
[1:27:28] amen i could just hear it
[1:27:31] dave has lost his anointing
[1:27:35] yeah we we thought that god was with him
[1:27:37] but look at what's happening now we've
[1:27:39] lost every we've followed this man lost
[1:27:41] look what has cost us
[1:27:43] and they got to the place they was
[1:27:44] absolutely ready to kill david
[1:27:47] but i love the bible david amen the
[1:27:49] scripture said david encouraged himself
[1:27:51] in the lord
[1:27:54] and david amen called for the priest
[1:27:58] he said bring the ephi bring amen he
[1:28:00] said and he inquired of the lord
[1:28:03] even david didn't just listen to the
[1:28:06] people
[1:28:08] david didn't just shrink up in a corner
[1:28:11] and feel sorry for
[1:28:12] himself but david inquired of the lord
[1:28:16] and he said god shall i pursue this
[1:28:18] enemy
[1:28:20] and god said pursuit
[1:28:23] for thou without fail shall recover all
[1:28:27] [Music]
[1:28:29] hallelujah i can just hear it tonight
[1:28:32] amen david got into a spot amen i think
[1:28:34] david probably said something like this
[1:28:36] lord is there any use and can continue
[1:28:39] it
[1:28:40] is there any need for me to keep going
[1:28:42] even my own people hate me amen it don't
[1:28:44] seem like it's doing no good we've lost
[1:28:46] everything we had is there any need for
[1:28:48] us to keep and god said yeah get up
[1:28:51] david
[1:28:54] hallelujah amen what the enemy done is
[1:28:57] temporary
[1:29:00] i only allowed it to happen to show you
[1:29:02] my power
[1:29:05] hallelujah because everything you lost
[1:29:08] you're gonna get it back
[1:29:12] and my message to you is pursuit
[1:29:17] hallelujah and if you're sitting here
[1:29:19] tonight thinking is there any need of
[1:29:21] trying let me tell you
[1:29:23] absolutely
[1:29:26] hallelujah you got lost children pursue
[1:29:31] you lost your health pursue
[1:29:34] you've lost your joy pursue
[1:29:37] you lost your peace
[1:29:39] pursuit
[1:29:41] you lost your praise pursue
[1:29:44] come on church are you just going to
[1:29:46] stand there and let the devil have it i
[1:29:48] say no
[1:29:51] i feel like the three lepers
[1:29:53] sitting at the gate tonight
[1:29:55] and they begin to sit and one rose up
[1:29:57] and say why said we here that we die
[1:30:00] let's go down to the enemy's camp
[1:30:04] and take back
[1:30:06] everything
[1:30:08] that he stole from us
[1:30:12] hallelujah
[1:30:13] let's take back our hill
[1:30:16] take back our children
[1:30:18] take back your praise
[1:30:20] is your god-given right
[1:30:24] hallelujah i got a word from the lord
[1:30:27] tonight for you without fail shall
[1:30:29] recover all
[1:30:31] [Music]
[1:30:35] there ain't a devil big enough
[1:30:37] [Applause]
[1:30:39] come on church there ain't a spirit
[1:30:41] great enough amen that can stop the
[1:30:44] power of god
[1:30:49] [Applause]
[1:30:51] they even encourage himself in the lord
[1:31:00] well the man said the great charge is at
[1:31:02] hand
[1:31:05] hallelujah
[1:31:07] he said
[1:31:08] soldiers with armors gleaming's colors
[1:31:10] streaming faith and doubt is setting
[1:31:12] itself in a ray
[1:31:14] right in this tabernacle doubt on one
[1:31:16] side faith on the other soldiers
[1:31:18] he says stand at your post of duty
[1:31:20] hallelujah
[1:31:21] our captain the morning star has never
[1:31:23] he leads on see he never goes back
[1:31:26] he never
[1:31:28] don't know the word retreat
[1:31:33] hallelujah he don't know the word
[1:31:35] retreat
[1:31:38] the greatest battle
[1:31:40] has ever been false going on right here
[1:31:42] right now
[1:31:44] between life and death sickness and
[1:31:45] health faith and doubt between liberty
[1:31:48] and bondage the battle is on
[1:31:50] shine your spears
[1:31:54] come on church
[1:31:55] let me just tell you this tonight as a
[1:31:57] preacher we need you
[1:31:58] [Music]
[1:32:00] this is not a preacher's battle
[1:32:02] preachers are in the battle
[1:32:04] we're in the forefront of the fight
[1:32:06] but this ain't just a preacher's battle
[1:32:09] every believer is in this battle
[1:32:12] we need you
[1:32:14] i'm gonna say i'm not rebuking you
[1:32:16] tonight but i just i tell my church this
[1:32:18] at the trouble we guys we got too many
[1:32:20] clean swords in the church
[1:32:23] they leave them in the sheath all the
[1:32:24] time
[1:32:25] they've hung them on the mantel
[1:32:26] somewhere church if ain't blood on your
[1:32:28] sword you need to get it out sharpen it
[1:32:31] up
[1:32:32] hallelujah this ain't the time to lay
[1:32:33] down this ain't the time to give up this
[1:32:36] is a time draw your sword
[1:32:39] press the battle
[1:32:43] the enemy is real
[1:32:50] satan ain't lit up
[1:32:54] and neither have we
[1:33:03] listen
[1:33:04] we're foreseen we also
[1:33:07] are compassed about what's so great
[1:33:09] a cloud of witnesses
[1:33:12] let us lay aside every weight
[1:33:17] last night every sin
[1:33:20] that's so easy but say and let us run
[1:33:24] amen amen in other words probably paul
[1:33:26] is telling us
[1:33:28] listen wherever we can pass about what's
[1:33:30] so great and remember he's just went
[1:33:31] through the the great witness
[1:33:35] of the great heroes of the faith
[1:33:37] and it spoke of all the great victories
[1:33:39] that they had had
[1:33:41] and i want to ask you tonight
[1:33:43] what is going to be your excuse
[1:33:45] amen do you imagine trying to stand in
[1:33:47] front of god give your excuse why you
[1:33:49] quit
[1:33:53] i wonder how embarrassing it would be to
[1:33:55] come up before god and say well you know
[1:33:57] it just got too hard
[1:34:00] and you're standing beside paul
[1:34:03] a man who preached the gospel and they
[1:34:05] stoned him
[1:34:06] they stoned him so so badly until they
[1:34:09] laid him out outside the gate as a dead
[1:34:11] man
[1:34:15] man i wonder if you could stand and
[1:34:17] and say well you know i would have i
[1:34:19] would have kept going but it just you
[1:34:21] just don't know it got so hard and the
[1:34:23] pressure was so great and here's stan
[1:34:25] peter
[1:34:27] who was beat
[1:34:29] with stripes
[1:34:32] thrown in a prison
[1:34:34] all right with me church you know i
[1:34:36] wonder if we stand and even make a
[1:34:38] excuse of why we couldn't do it and and
[1:34:40] while we couldn't persevere and here's
[1:34:43] men like a
[1:34:44] john wycliffe and and william tyndale
[1:34:47] and men that were burned at the stake
[1:34:49] amen for the for what they knew and they
[1:34:52] didn't even have the revelation
[1:34:54] [Applause]
[1:34:56] of the full word of god that you have
[1:34:59] [Applause]
[1:35:01] think about these bunch of layout i said
[1:35:03] i i listen church
[1:35:05] i don't preach with gloves on so i hope
[1:35:07] it's all right amen but this bunch of
[1:35:09] layouts seeing cowards
[1:35:11] a bunch of five preachers we got
[1:35:14] come on church where are they going to
[1:35:16] stand on that day
[1:35:18] beside of men like paul
[1:35:20] and peter
[1:35:22] men like william branham
[1:35:29] i wonder where they would stand to stand
[1:35:31] by a man like ron spencer
[1:35:34] a bunch of 65 preachers they got all
[1:35:37] kind of reason why they can't preach the
[1:35:38] word
[1:35:39] amen they're turning around and giving
[1:35:41] up and everything here's a man that
[1:35:43] stood in a pulpit for
[1:35:45] years
[1:35:47] sick in his body
[1:35:48] but there ain't no quit in him
[1:35:54] hallelujah
[1:35:56] determine
[1:35:58] i'm going to preach this word
[1:36:00] until the last breath
[1:36:02] leaves my body
[1:36:07] hallelujah i'm glad that god still got
[1:36:10] some men
[1:36:11] that's got a backbone
[1:36:13] that's got some grit
[1:36:18] hallelujah i want the devil to know in
[1:36:20] all hell amen god still got some men
[1:36:25] that ain't got no quit in them
[1:36:27] we ain't giving up we're not turning
[1:36:30] around we're not backing down we're not
[1:36:33] laying down
[1:36:34] come on church
[1:36:36] i may die but i'll die in the faith
[1:36:42] and if i do
[1:36:44] when he calls
[1:36:46] i will rise
[1:36:48] [Music]
[1:36:52] hallelujah
[1:36:59] what excuse will we have
[1:37:02] what excuse will we have
[1:37:04] there is no excuse
[1:37:07] listen there is no reason

[1:37:15] because i want to tell you the best
[1:37:16] thing about this whole this whole um
[1:37:19] text

[1:37:24] enemy
[1:37:25] [Applause]
[1:37:30] come on church
[1:37:32] they were not wore out because the devil
[1:37:34] had chased them in a corner
[1:37:37] the only reason they were tired
[1:37:40] is because they had chased the enemy
[1:37:43] so far
[1:37:45] and so long
[1:37:48] hallelujah
[1:37:50] i'd rather wear it out than rust out and
[1:37:53] i'll tell you one thing brother amen if

[1:40:52] battle's getting a little tough
[1:40:59] be encouraged tonight
[1:41:01] [Music]
[1:41:06] i was just thinking about that one
[1:41:11] get in
[1:41:13] the army got down to 300.
[1:41:15] here's an army like grasshoppers in
[1:41:16] front of them
[1:41:18] for multitude
[1:41:22] but i thought back to elisha
[1:41:25] the syrian army around him
[1:41:27] he looked over and
[1:41:29] little servant was all
[1:41:32] covered over fear and
[1:41:34] he said lord
[1:41:36] just open his eyes
[1:41:38] let him see
[1:41:40] [Music]
[1:41:44] ain't more with us than there are
[1:41:45] against us
[1:41:50] brother brown said that elisha didn't
[1:41:52] bring the angels down
[1:41:55] he only changed the scene of the servant
[1:41:58] he opened his eyes to something that was
[1:42:00] already there
[1:42:02] and i declare unto you tonight in the
[1:42:04] name of the lord this building is full
[1:42:07] of the angels of god
[1:42:10] a pillar of fires right in this building
[1:42:12] tonight
[1:42:13] jesus christ is here
[1:42:19] there's more with you than there is
[1:42:20] against him
[1:42:23] we had a prophet coming this day and
[1:42:24] declared us
[1:42:26] the unseen realm the supernatural
[1:42:29] and he
[1:42:30] he described it as something like this
[1:42:32] i got a reason for saying this he
[1:42:34] described it something like this he said
[1:42:36] a man that didn't have the sight didn't
[1:42:38] have the sense of his sight
[1:42:40] he said something could be there
[1:42:43] but he not know what it was see because
[1:42:45] he can't see it
[1:42:47] he had not the sense to declare it
[1:42:50] he said he'd bump into something
[1:42:52] and he would know that it was something
[1:42:54] there but he didn't know what it was
[1:42:56] that he was touching see because he
[1:42:58] didn't have the sin he said but somebody
[1:43:00] that had this sense of
[1:43:02] of sight
[1:43:04] could tell him what it was that he had
[1:43:05] bumped into he says just like him
[1:43:07] feeling the rays of the sun
[1:43:09] he could feel it
[1:43:11] but he couldn't declare what it was
[1:43:13] he said but somebody that could see it
[1:43:15] could say that what you're feeling
[1:43:17] is the sun shining on you
[1:43:20] and then the prophet of god said and
[1:43:21] sometimes
[1:43:23] you bump into something
[1:43:25] you feel a surge of something
[1:43:27] there's something rises up in you and
[1:43:29] you just gotta lift your hand and say
[1:43:31] hallelujah
[1:43:32] he said what it is is that's an angel
[1:43:36] there's an eighth there's angels all
[1:43:38] around you amen and i believe that some
[1:43:40] of you tonight have bumped into an angel
