[34:38] And should I fall in the space between
[34:41] what remains of me and this reckoning,
[34:46] either way, I won't bow to the things of
[34:50] this world.
[34:55] And I know I will never be alone.
[35:00] There is another in the fire
[35:05] standing next to me.
[35:09] There is another in the waterers
[35:14] holding back the sea.
[35:17] Should I ever need reminding
[35:22] the power set me free.
[35:26] There is a grave that holds nobody
[35:31] and the power lives in me.
[35:35] There is another in the fire.
[35:40] Oh,
[35:43] there is another in the fire.
[35:48] Oh,
[35:52] there is another in the fire.
[35:57] Oh,
[36:01] and I can see the light in the darkness
[36:07] as the darkness bows to him. I can hear
[36:11] the roar
[36:13] in the heavens
[36:15] as the space between thin. I can feel
[36:20] the ground shake beneath us as the
[36:24] prison walls cave in. Nothing stands
[36:29] between us.
[36:32] Nothing stands between us.
[36:38] [Music]
[37:11] Be another in the fire
[37:16] standing next to me.
[37:20] There'll be another in the waterers
[37:25] holding back the sea.
[37:28] And should I ever needing

[37:37] I'll count the joy of every battle.

[53:30] Marcus. After you get
[53:33] to a certain spot in your life, you
[53:36] retire from sports.
[53:41] Amen.
[53:43] I understand grandkids.
[53:45] So, I'm not retired yet. So,
[53:48] I'm just more careful.
[53:51] Hebrews chap 11 and verse one.
[53:55] Could we just read these first three
[53:57] verses together tonight because they're
[53:59] so powerful. Now, faith is the substance
[54:02] of things hoped for, the evidence of
[54:06] things not seen. For by it, the elders
[54:10] obtained a good report.
[54:12] Through faith we understand that the
[54:15] worlds were framed by the word of God.
[54:18] So that things which are seen were not
[54:21] made of things which do appear. Amen.
[54:25] Maybe you have a need. You just want to
[54:26] bring it before the Lord. Let's just
[54:28] raise our hand before God. Lord Jesus,
[54:30] we love you tonight and we're so
[54:32] thankful to stand at this sacred desk
[54:34] one more time. I ask you that you would
[54:37] anoint us in a special way. Father, your
[54:40] word is anointed, but Lord, we ask you
[54:43] that you would bring us inspiration to
[54:46] speak your word just now. Lord, anoint
[54:49] this audience.
[54:50] Many of us have incredible needs and we
[54:54] need you to pass by. and father the
[54:56] great physicians in the building. I
[54:59] remember one time having stomach issues
[55:01] and had blisters all through my body
[55:04] through my the my stomach and all
[55:07] through my colon and sitting in a
[55:10] service where brother Tim Puit was
[55:11] preaching the great physician came by
[55:15] and I didn't have to take another pill
[55:17] from that night forward. You're that
[55:20] kind of a God
[55:22] and I want to thank you for it. Lord, we
[55:25] welcome you to where we are. Lord, we
[55:28] ask you that you'd speak to us in a
[55:30] special way now in Jesus Christ's name.
[55:33] Amen and amen.
[55:35] You may be seated.
[55:41] Recently the Pentagon began to have a
[55:44] worship service once a month
[55:47] and they have that service. It's a half
[55:50] an hour on company time, your government
[55:53] time. And all the believers that are
[55:56] there, not necessarily believers like
[55:58] us, but Christians,
[56:00] they come, they come together to pray
[56:03] and they invite a speaker to come and
[56:06] and heads pastor from Kentucky,
[56:09] Nowhereville, Kentucky. They ask him to
[56:12] be the first speaker. And so
[56:17] I heard he was going to be the speaker.
[56:18] So I went and watched it. I thought it
[56:21] would be interesting. a country a
[56:23] country preacher is going to address the
[56:25] greatest military might in the world.
[56:28] And I thought, you know, I I pray that
[56:30] God help him. I I I I did. I I honestly
[56:33] asked the Lord to help him. And so he
[56:37] got up and began to talk to them at how
[56:40] that you're the most powerful army, the
[56:42] most with the most powerful weapons,
[56:46] but you're human beings.
[56:49] But we serve a great God. Amen.
[56:53] and that God is greater than all of
[56:55] humanity. Right? And he reminded them
[56:58] that just because you have the weapons
[57:01] at your disposal don't make you God.
[57:07] You must pray.
[57:10] You must dedicate time before you pull
[57:13] triggers. That's right. I'm praying for
[57:16] our president right now. He's got a huge
[57:19] decision to make.
[57:21] It's a possibility of World War II is
[57:24] just right in front of us. And hey, we
[57:26] got to go home.
[57:29] Are you with me? The Pope's in his
[57:31] place. President's in his place.
[57:35] Russia's in their place.
[57:38] That's right. Israel's in their place.
[57:40] The bride's in her place.
[57:45] [Applause]
[57:54] I want to say this as a prophet would
[57:56] say it to us.
[57:58] May I say this to you? You're the most
[58:01] powerful body in the world.
[58:04] You're a piece of the bride all over the
[58:09] earth.
[58:10] We all heard the same prophet.
[58:13] That prophet speaking greatest prophet
[58:15] since Jesus Christ stood on the earth
[58:18] and displayed Jesus Christ himself even
[58:22] to the point that men would worship
[58:24] brother Brandaman he quickly quit made
[58:27] sure that you didn't worship him but he
[58:29] was bringing a message from the throne
[58:33] understanding that as a believer then he
[58:36] would turn to you as a believer and he'd
[58:38] say a believer
[58:41] has more authority
[58:43] than the angels that are in heaven.
[58:46] Where is that authority at? It's in
[58:48] prayer. It's in the word of God. Listen,
[58:52] this word that is presented to before
[58:55] you is not poetry.
[58:58] It's not some historical facts that come
[59:00] together, but it's the most powerful
[59:03] book that has ever been written
[59:07] by the most powerful author.
[59:10] That's right. Now, when we begin to
[59:14] there's no way that I can touch the even
[59:17] the tip of this, how great is our God,
[59:19] but if if you would just give me some
[59:21] leniency, we'll try. Amen. Psalms
[59:24] chapter 33 and verse 6, by the word of
[59:28] the Lord
[59:30] where the heavens made.
[59:32] Remember, brother Brandham says, "God
[59:34] spoke it and believed his own word and
[59:38] and all of the most host of them by the
[59:42] breath of his mouth." Isaiah chapter 40
[59:45] and verse 26. Lift up your eyes, oh
[59:48] high. And behold, who hath created these
[59:51] things that bringeth their host by n
[59:55] number. He calleth them by
[59:59] all by names, by the greatness of his
[1:00:02] might, for that he is strong in power,
[1:00:06] and not one faileth.
[1:00:10] Come on.
[1:00:12] It is impossible for God to fail.
[1:00:21] That's enough to shout about right
[1:00:23] there. It is totally impossible for God
[1:00:27] to fail. Hallelujah.
[1:00:30] Revelations 4:11, "Thou art worthy, oh
[1:00:33] Lord, to receive glory and honor and
[1:00:37] power, for thou hast created all
[1:00:40] things." Thank you, Lord. And for thy
[1:00:42] pleasure they are and were created.
[1:00:48] The scripture tells us that greater is
[1:00:51] he that is in the world. Amen.
[1:00:55] Greater is he that is in you. Forgive
[1:00:57] me. Greater is he that is in you than he
[1:01:04] that is in the world.
[1:01:07] I think if you could just think about
[1:01:09] that right now, you have more power than
[1:01:12] the president of the United States.
[1:01:15] You have you have more power than Putin.
[1:01:20] That's right.
[1:01:24] Cuz you're connected to a great big God.
[1:01:32] Revelations chap 21 and verse one.
[1:01:36] When I read this, I I feel like I want
[1:01:37] to shout every time I read it. And I saw
[1:01:40] a new heaven and a new earth.
[1:01:44] For the first heaven and the first earth
[1:01:46] were passed away, and there was no more
[1:01:49] sea.
[1:01:53] And I, John, saw the holy city, the new
[1:01:56] Jerusalem, coming down from God out of
[1:01:58] heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for
[1:02:02] her husband.
[1:02:04] And I heard a great voice out of heaven,
[1:02:06] saying, "Behold, the tabernacle of God
[1:02:09] is with men, and he will dwell with
[1:02:11] them, and they shall be his people, and
[1:02:14] God himself shall shall be with them,
[1:02:16] and be their God,
[1:02:18] and God shall wipe away all tears from
[1:02:22] their eyes, and there shall be no more
[1:02:24] death." Amen. Amen. How big is God?
[1:02:28] There'll be no more death. There's
[1:02:30] neither sorrow nor crying or neither
[1:02:33] shall there be any more pain
[1:02:37] for the former things
[1:02:40] are passed away
[1:02:43] and he that sat upon the throne said
[1:02:45] behold I make all things new
[1:02:50] I don't think in our mind we can fathom
[1:02:52] that sentence right there and he said
[1:02:56] unto me write for these These words are
[1:03:01] true and faithful.
[1:03:05] When I read that, behold, I make all
[1:03:07] things new.
[1:03:09] We live in the last couple of
[1:03:12] generations with people that want to
[1:03:15] they realize that man has polluted the
[1:03:18] earth.
[1:03:20] And they've come under a a a sense of
[1:03:23] we've got to start fixing things on the
[1:03:26] earth.
[1:03:28] We got to have clean air.
[1:03:31] We got to stop pollution. We got to stop
[1:03:34] doing that. And listen, they have spent
[1:03:37] billions and trillions of dollars,
[1:03:40] right?
[1:03:42] System trying to undo what they've done.
[1:03:47] And God will do it all in a moment.
[1:03:51] [Applause]
[1:03:52] He'll do it all in a moment.
[1:03:55] [Applause]
[1:04:04] He stretches out the heavens. Isaiah 40
[1:04:07] and verse 22. He stretches out the
[1:04:09] heavens like a canopy.
[1:04:12] And he spreads them out like a tent to
[1:04:14] live in. What a what a thought. And and
[1:04:19] God created Isaiah 40:12. God created
[1:04:22] the stars and the galaxy
[1:04:26] with a word.
[1:04:28] Scientists say
[1:04:31] the universe is over 93
[1:04:35] billion light years
[1:04:38] wide.
[1:04:42] You won't do that in a day.
[1:04:45] And yet God holds it in the palm of his
[1:04:49] hands.
[1:04:57] Psalms 90 and verse two.
[1:05:00] Before the mountains were born
[1:05:03] or you brought forth the whole world
[1:05:06] from everlasting to everlasting.
[1:05:10] You are God. Amen.
[1:05:17] I want you to think about this. God
[1:05:19] exist outside of time
[1:05:23] before there was even a beginning
[1:05:30] and he still never changes.
[1:05:34] You've been married any time at all, you
[1:05:36] know that God's great.
[1:05:40] Psalms 147 and verse 5. I'm not I'm
[1:05:42] believing.
[1:05:45] Great is our Lord
[1:05:48] and mighty in his power. His
[1:05:52] understanding
[1:05:53] has no limit.
[1:05:57] I'm reading out the Passion translation.
[1:05:59] You just hang right with me.
[1:06:01] God knows all things.
[1:06:05] That's quite a statement in it. God
[1:06:08] knows all things.
[1:06:12] past, present, future.
[1:06:17] God contains the greatest library that
[1:06:21] there's ever been
[1:06:24] and he's never forgot it.
[1:06:27] He understands your thoughts before it
[1:06:30] comes out of your mouth.
[1:06:33] Some things are left better unsaid.
[1:06:40] God knows you completely.
[1:06:45] Now we think about how great he is.
[1:06:47] Jeremiah 32 and verse1 17. Sovereign
[1:06:50] Lord you have made the heavens and the
[1:06:53] earth by your great power and
[1:06:56] outstretched arms. Nothing is too hard
[1:07:00] for you.
[1:07:03] Why are you preaching this? Because some
[1:07:05] of us has got needs that we think God
[1:07:07] can't fix.
[1:07:13] Going to preach to you.
[1:07:15] Some of us think God can't fix this. Are
[1:07:18] you kidding me?
[1:07:22] Are you kidding me?
[1:07:25] Let's just keep going.
[1:07:27] Ephesians chapter 3 and verse 18. And I
[1:07:30] pray that you may grasp how wide and
[1:07:33] long and high and deep is the love of
[1:07:36] Christ.
[1:07:39] Listen, there's no sin
[1:07:43] that's too deep.
[1:07:47] You will hold a grudge.
[1:07:50] You will hold it against one another.
[1:07:53] But there's no sin that's too deep. Look
[1:07:57] over at your neighbor. Let's just cover
[1:07:59] it. Look over at your neighbors and God
[1:08:01] says that there's no sin too deep.
[1:08:08] There's no heart that's too far away.
[1:08:14] God reaches further than you could ever
[1:08:17] run.
[1:08:19] He's bigger than your fears.
[1:08:23] He's greater than your struggles. And
[1:08:26] he's stronger than your enemy.
[1:08:39] Just smile at the devil right now. You
[1:08:42] know you want to win inside.
[1:08:46] Those Israelites got to be smiling over
[1:08:48] there. They know.
[1:08:51] They know we're going to win.
[1:08:56] We got to win.
[1:09:03] I want to say more than just natural
[1:09:05] Israel. Spiritual Israel is going to
[1:09:07] win. The bride of Jesus Christ is not
[1:09:10] going down. She's going up.
[1:09:21] I love this next. The Lord is near to
[1:09:24] all that call on him.
[1:09:33] God is as far away as you put him.
[1:09:38] Come on.
[1:09:40] Brother Brandon prays a prayer that I
[1:09:42] think's outstanding.
[1:09:46] I want you to just think how critical
[1:09:49] even in a service that things are and he
[1:09:53] says while we have our heads bowed
[1:09:56] I want
[1:09:58] I want person who you're sitting next to
[1:10:02] I want you to lay your hands on that
[1:10:04] person next to you and just lay your
[1:10:06] hands on them inside and outside no
[1:10:10] matter where you are talking about
[1:10:11] inside and outside of the building he
[1:10:14] said, "Lay your hands." He said, "I
[1:10:16] don't care what you have a need of. That
[1:10:19] doesn't matter a bit."
[1:10:24] That's right. Now, we're serving an a
[1:10:26] limitless God.
[1:10:28] And your need doesn't matter a bit.
[1:10:36] I don't care where that person is, might
[1:10:39] be across the seas, across the ocean, no
[1:10:42] matter where it is, God car covers all
[1:10:45] space, feels all time. He's omnipotent.
[1:10:50] He's omnipresent.
[1:10:53] He's infinite.
[1:10:55] He's here now.
[1:10:58] And he hears your prayer. Amen.
[1:11:01] And the Bible said that these signs
[1:11:03] shall follow them that believe and each
[1:11:07] one of you are a believer. Lay your
[1:11:09] hands on the sick and they shall
[1:11:12] recover.
[1:11:15] Brother Ron, how powerful is prayer?
[1:11:17] Brother Brand, it's more powerful than
[1:11:18] an atomic bomb.
[1:11:23] Moses prayed
[1:11:25] and Egypt, the greatest soldiers in the
[1:11:29] world, became fish food.
[1:11:35] Daniel prayed and lions laid down only
[1:11:40] to later eat up his foes.
[1:11:46] I like this next one. Elijah prayed and
[1:11:50] outrun the horses
[1:11:54] of the king 40 miles.
[1:11:59] That's right. I'm not talking about a 40
[1:12:02] yard dash.
[1:12:06] An old prophet got under the anointing
[1:12:09] of God.
[1:12:14] Brother Ron, I it's hard for me to
[1:12:16] grasp. Well, let me come now to your
[1:12:18] address
[1:12:19] for in 2 Corinthians chapter 5 and verse
[1:12:22] 17. Therefore, if any man be in Christ,
[1:12:27] he is a new creature.
[1:12:31] All things are passed away and behold,
[1:12:34] all things are become new.
[1:12:38] God rewrites your life.
[1:12:44] I'd like to say it like this. He takes
[1:12:46] your old book, the old chapters, the old
[1:12:49] things, and he tears it out of the book.
[1:12:54] [Music]
[1:12:56] Isn't that powerful?
[1:12:59] Now, none of us has had a day like Job.
[1:13:02] None of us.
[1:13:05] None has had a year like Job.
[1:13:08] And I want you to just listen to this
[1:13:10] conversation. You've been a Christian a
[1:13:13] while. You know this where we're going.
[1:13:15] In Job chapter 38 and verse one, then
[1:13:19] the Lord answered Job out of a whirlwind
[1:13:21] and said,
[1:13:24] "Who is it that darkeneth and counsel by
[1:13:26] the words without knowledge?"
[1:13:29] G up now thy loins like a man, for I
[1:13:32] will demand of thee and and answer thou
[1:13:35] me.
[1:13:37] Where was thou
[1:13:41] when I laid the foundations of the
[1:13:43] earth?
[1:13:45] Declare if you understanding,
[1:13:48] who laid the measures thereof, if thou
[1:13:50] knowest,
[1:13:52] or who hath stretched the line upon it?
[1:13:57] Whereupon are the foundations thereof it
[1:13:59] fastenth? And who laid the cornerstone
[1:14:01] thereof?
[1:14:03] When the morning stars sang together,
[1:14:06] and all the sons of God shouted for joy.
[1:14:12] I want to read a quote before I I go
[1:14:14] further. Brother B says, "Who is this
[1:14:17] Job?"
[1:14:20] When he said, "Where was thou when I
[1:14:22] laid the foundation of the earth? When
[1:14:24] the morning stars sang together and the
[1:14:26] sons of God shouted for joy, who were
[1:14:29] those sons of God that was shouting for
[1:14:33] joy,
[1:14:34] Jesus told them,
[1:14:37] "I had joy with you before the
[1:14:39] foundation of the world."
[1:14:42] I want you to notice this next sermon,
[1:14:44] this next quote. We're not creatures of
[1:14:48] time.
[1:14:51] We're creatures of eternity.
[1:14:59] We're not creatures of time. We're
[1:15:03] creatures of eternity.
[1:15:07] Now, I want you to understand this real
[1:15:09] clearly before I go on.
[1:15:12] When God come down to Job, God didn't
[1:15:16] come to him like some of his friends did
[1:15:19] and said, "Have you sinned?"
[1:15:22] Why are you in the situation? As a
[1:15:24] matter of fact, in this conversation,
[1:15:27] God doesn't mention any of the
[1:15:29] circumstances.
[1:15:33] God don't come to your level. He brings
[1:15:35] you up to his
[1:15:39] cuz he don't want to get down in your
[1:15:40] pity party.
[1:15:43] And when he brings you up to his, he
[1:15:45] gives you eyes.
[1:15:48] You're no longer under the control of
[1:15:51] all of the things that are going on in
[1:15:52] your life.
[1:15:55] I find it amazing. You can have a wreck
[1:15:58] of a week.
[1:16:00] walk in on Saturday night or Sunday
[1:16:02] morning and God raise you up
[1:16:08] and give you a temporary resurrection to
[1:16:11] where you forget everything that's going
[1:16:13] on in your life.
[1:16:25] We are not creatures of time.
[1:16:29] But we're creatures of eternity.
[1:16:35] It's hard to wrap your mind about, but
[1:16:37] remember, we serve a great big God.
[1:16:44] Paul writes it like this.
[1:16:46] Second Corinthians chapter 5 and verse
[1:16:49] one.
[1:16:50] For we know that if our earthly house of
[1:16:53] this tabernacle
[1:16:55] were dissolved,
[1:16:57] we have a building
[1:17:00] of God, a house not made with hands,
[1:17:05] eternal in the heavens.
[1:17:08] That's right.
[1:17:10] Somewhere there's a 5 foot five
[1:17:13] redheaded brown
[1:17:18] healthy Yeah. Come on. That body didn't
[1:17:22] fall 40 ft. That body wasn't snake
[1:17:24] bitten. That body was wasn't
[1:17:28] burned. That body
[1:17:31] it's not fighting cancer.
[1:17:36] The devil.
[1:17:43] For in this we groan earnestly desired
[1:17:46] to be clothed upon with our house which
[1:17:49] is of is from heaven. If so be that
[1:17:52] being clothed, we shall not be found
[1:17:54] naked. For we that are in this
[1:17:58] tabernacle do groan being burdened, not
[1:18:01] for that way we would be unclothed or
[1:18:04] but clothed upon that immortal that
[1:18:06] mortality might be swallowed up of life.
[1:18:10] Now he that hath wrought us for the
[1:18:14] selfsame thing is a God who also hath
[1:18:17] given us the eternal the earnest of the
[1:18:21] spirit.
[1:18:23] Therefore we are always confident. I
[1:18:26] love this quote. Therefore we are always
[1:18:29] confident knowing this. Whilst we are at
[1:18:32] home in the body we are absent from the
[1:18:35] Lord. For we walk in faith, not by not
[1:18:39] by sight. We're confident, I say, and
[1:18:42] willing rather to be absent from the
[1:18:45] body and to be present with the Lord.
[1:18:50] I just read, you can't lose.
[1:18:55] That's right.
[1:18:56] You're going to die. Yeah, but I'm going
[1:18:58] to be with God.
[1:19:01] [Music]
[1:19:03] Do you get it? You're going to die.
[1:19:05] Yeah, but I'm going to be with God.
[1:19:14] [Music]
[1:19:17] Genesis 22
[1:19:20] and 10. And Abraham stretched forth his
[1:19:23] hand and took the knife to slay his son.
[1:19:27] And the angel of the Lord called unto
[1:19:29] him out of heaven and said,"Abraham,
[1:19:32] Abraham."
[1:19:34] And he said, "Here am I."
[1:19:36] And he said, "Lay not thine hand upon
[1:19:39] the lad, neither do anything unto him.
[1:19:44] For now I know that thou fears God."
[1:19:49] Seeing, "Thou hast not withheld thy son,
[1:19:52] thine only son from me."
[1:19:55] That's what they're fighting for over
[1:19:56] over there. They can't figure out that
[1:20:00] only son. Amen.
[1:20:03] And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and he
[1:20:05] looked, and behold, behind him a ram
[1:20:08] caught in the thicket by his horns. And
[1:20:10] Abraham went and took the ram and
[1:20:12] offered up for a burnt offering in
[1:20:14] thestead of his son. And Abraham called
[1:20:17] the name of the place Jehovah Gyra.
[1:20:21] And it is said, "To this day, in the
[1:20:23] mount of the Lord, it shall be seen."
[1:20:27] And the angel Lord called to Abraham out
[1:20:30] of the heaven the second time.
[1:20:33] I want to show you how big God is. And
[1:20:36] said, "By myself have I sworn, saith the
[1:20:39] Lord. For because thou hast done this
[1:20:42] thing, thou hast not withheld thy son,
[1:20:46] thine only son,
[1:20:48] that in blessing I will bless thee, and
[1:20:51] in multiplying I will multiply thy
[1:20:54] seed." Notice what he says. as the stars
[1:20:58] of the heaven,
[1:21:02] as the sand which which is upon the
[1:21:05] seashore.
[1:21:07] And thy seed shall possess the gates of
[1:21:12] his enemy.
[1:21:14] And in thy seed shall all the nations of
[1:21:17] the earth be blessed because thou hast
[1:21:21] obeyed my voice. Amen.
[1:21:25] The next time you're at a beach,
[1:21:29] we don't go to the beach. Okay. Well,
[1:21:31] you just kind of imagine a little bit.
[1:21:34] Reach down and grab yourself a fistful
[1:21:37] of hand.
[1:21:39] Sand.
[1:21:42] Thank you.
[1:21:48] In your hand, grab a fistful of sand.
[1:21:51] Say that 10 times quick.
[1:21:57] Now you've only started.
[1:21:59] Count the grains. That's right. Thank
[1:22:02] you, Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:22:06] That's impossible, brother Ron. Well,
[1:22:08] just think about it. The sand from all
[1:22:10] over the earth
[1:22:13] and God said, "So shall thy seed be."
[1:22:18] Look at the stars of the heaven. That's
[1:22:20] right.
[1:22:22] We could preach tonight on from dust to
[1:22:24] stars.
[1:22:27] And when in the night time, Abraham
[1:22:29] could look up before pollution and could
[1:22:32] see all the stars of the heavens.
[1:22:35] Try to count them.
[1:22:39] Try to count them. God wrote his first
[1:22:42] Bible up there. That's right.
[1:22:45] You can't count them. They're
[1:22:46] innumerable.
[1:22:48] So shall thy seed be.
[1:22:52] He was troubled having one son. And
[1:22:54] God's telling him, "Your sons are going
[1:22:56] to be like the sand of the of the sea
[1:22:58] and the stars of the heaven."
[1:23:09] I was in Utah.
[1:23:11] Connie and I were headed to a meeting.
[1:23:17] and they canceled our flight. Now, we've
[1:23:20] done spent one night trying to get
[1:23:22] there. Now, we're getting ready to spend
[1:23:24] another night.
[1:23:28] Well, they worked us in to where we
[1:23:30] could fly later that evening.
[1:23:33] And so, they give us a meal. The guy
[1:23:36] standing beside of me had the same
[1:23:37] problem. He was heading into a wedding,
[1:23:40] but I was too.
[1:23:44] I was just going to preach at it.
[1:23:46] a convention and he was headed to a
[1:23:49] natural wedding of a friend. This boy
[1:23:52] was a Jewish boy. And so they they
[1:23:55] offered me the best steak in the house
[1:23:58] in the in the airport. And I said,
[1:24:00] "Well, he needs it." He said, "Yeah, I
[1:24:03] do." I said, "He's going to eat with
[1:24:04] me." So they gave me enough vouchers to
[1:24:07] where he could eat with me. So, we were
[1:24:10] sitting across the table and and the
[1:24:13] food came and we just was making small
[1:24:15] talk and I said, "It's time to pray."
[1:24:18] Okay, you go ahead. And so I prayed
[1:24:22] and uh I said, "Are you a Christian?" He
[1:24:25] said, "No, I'm a Jew." I said, "Well,
[1:24:27] we're linked in the scriptures."
[1:24:30] Amen. Come on. He said, "I don't know
[1:24:33] about that." I said, "Oh, yeah." I said,
[1:24:35] "Now, Abraham was promised a seed as the
[1:24:41] sand of the sea." Now, that's his
[1:24:43] natural seat.
[1:24:46] And you're one of them. I said, "We're
[1:24:48] actually in the same family." Really?
[1:24:52] And I said, "But if you'll look up,
[1:24:54] that's his spiritual seat." That's
[1:24:56] right.
[1:24:58] Before the evening was over, I led that
[1:25:01] doctor to the Lord.
[1:25:06] He got tired.
[1:25:14] Now think about it. If I don't have went
[1:25:15] to his office, he would have never let
[1:25:17] me in. I wouldn't have been able to
[1:25:18] spend five minutes with him. But God
[1:25:20] knew I needed to testify to that guy. So
[1:25:23] he delayed those planes,
[1:25:26] had dinner with him. Ain't nothing
[1:25:28] changed by God.
[1:25:30] I led him to the Lord and he got weary.
[1:25:32] He got tired and so he don't he said,
[1:25:35] "If you don't mind, I'm just going to
[1:25:37] lay at your feet."
[1:25:43] Me and Connie was sitting there and that
[1:25:45] guy actually laid so close to my feet,
[1:25:47] he was on my feet.
[1:25:50] When we arrived in Edmonton, he went and
[1:25:53] got all of his friends in tuxedos and he
[1:25:56] said, "I've met the most important man
[1:25:58] I've ever met in my life.
[1:26:06] This man led me to Jesus Christ.
[1:26:14] I'll see him one day.
[1:26:16] How you know that I led that man to
[1:26:19] Jesus Christ and I looked to him. I
[1:26:22] looked for him for 20ome years. Amen.
[1:26:28] I want to ask you, how big is our God?
[1:26:35] Brother Random said there's only one
[1:26:37] form of eternal life and that comes from
[1:26:40] God. And he forone ordained every
[1:26:44] creature that would ever have it. Just
[1:26:48] as you were in the gene in your father,
[1:26:51] you was in the gene of God. one of his
[1:26:54] attributes to begin with or you'll never
[1:26:57] be there. You come forth in the bedding
[1:26:59] ground of your mother and your father
[1:27:01] and didn't know it. Amen. You were in
[1:27:05] his loins and you come forth in the
[1:27:08] bedding ground of your mother. Then you
[1:27:10] become a human being and are made in the
[1:27:13] image of your father. Now you can have
[1:27:16] fellowship with them. He says, notice
[1:27:18] this next words, and the same thing by
[1:27:21] God. Amen. Amen.
[1:27:24] If you've got eternal life, right,
[1:27:29] brother Brandon would say, you are as
[1:27:31] eternal as God is eternal.
[1:27:36] That might stretch your mind just a
[1:27:38] little bit.
[1:27:40] Why not?
[1:27:44] So why do you let the devil whisper in
[1:27:46] your ear, "I'm going to destroy you.
[1:27:51] Come on.
[1:27:53] Come on. Why whisper in your ear? Don't
[1:27:55] listen to his lie.
[1:27:58] He doesn't have enough power. That's
[1:28:00] right.
[1:28:03] He doesn't have enough power. That's
[1:28:05] right. Come on. To destroy you. That's
[1:28:08] right.
[1:28:12] Now, God spoke his word and he believed
[1:28:14] his own word.
[1:28:18] The sun begin to come into existence
[1:28:20] because he said, "Let there be light."
[1:28:24] Right?
[1:28:26] There's authority. Where did he make it
[1:28:29] from? I don't know.
[1:28:32] I like how brother Baron said, "I don't
[1:28:34] know.
[1:28:36] There was nothing to make it from." But
[1:28:39] he believed his own word and there was
[1:28:41] light and I can see a piece fly off of
[1:28:43] that and it's a meteor and flew maybe a
[1:28:46] million years or or a hundred billion
[1:28:49] years if you can call it that and it
[1:28:51] circle way around and I can see him
[1:28:53] standing there watching it and it falls
[1:28:55] down here and he stops it and then
[1:28:59] another falls for 100 million years and
[1:29:01] and let it hang into orbit and here
[1:29:03] comes another one flying off the sun and
[1:29:05] it goes all over and it hangs hangs down
[1:29:08] and he stops it there. What is he doing?
[1:29:11] Right? He's writing his first Bible.
[1:29:20] You went to school and they said it was
[1:29:21] a big bang theory. It's a big bang
[1:29:23] theory. All right.
[1:29:26] He said then let's let us notice here.
[1:29:28] Yonder I see now all out in space that
[1:29:31] all is God without form
[1:29:37] forever. For eternities, no beginning
[1:29:41] and no ending.
[1:29:43] It's all God. Before there was even air,
[1:29:47] there was God.
[1:29:50] The very beginning of nature and
[1:29:52] creation was God. That's right.
[1:29:56] Amen. And now the Bible teaches us that
[1:29:58] the logos went out from God. Or I might
[1:30:02] just say it, the God becoming his first
[1:30:07] body form. The logos went out from God.
[1:30:10] Let's just look at it like no one has
[1:30:13] ever seen the father at any time.
[1:30:15] Nowhere. Never did and never will.
[1:30:19] But then the logos went out from him
[1:30:21] become like a little halo of light.
[1:30:25] Let's see it play in yonder like a child
[1:30:28] before the doorstep of his father. And
[1:30:30] now I can see him as he moves over here
[1:30:33] and he draws into this his memory or his
[1:30:37] mind a picture of what the world should
[1:30:39] be like.
[1:30:43] You know it had to blow some of those
[1:30:45] theologians mind. There stands a seventh
[1:30:47] grade educated guy. That's right.
[1:30:51] And he says, "Now I'm going to explain
[1:30:52] how it came into existence." Yeah, you
[1:30:55] are.
[1:30:58] Yeah, you are. We got schools that can't
[1:31:00] explain it.
[1:31:02] And there because the bride needed to
[1:31:05] know,
[1:31:06] not some bunch of churches needed to
[1:31:08] know. the bride needed to know
[1:31:13] cuz you came out of him and you're going
[1:31:16] back to him. So, it's important for God
[1:31:19] to open the book. Yes, sir. And God to
[1:31:22] say, "This is how I made it." Amen. And
[1:31:25] in saying it, he's telling you how big
[1:31:28] he is.
[1:31:32] I hear him say, "Let there be." And an
[1:31:35] atom broke under. And when it did, the
[1:31:37] sun came into existence and began to
[1:31:39] whirl and she burned for a million years
[1:31:41] and millions millions of years, you
[1:31:44] know. And then scientist says it's going
[1:31:45] to burn out one day. Are you kidding?
[1:31:52] Are you serious,
[1:31:54] brother Ron? We got to conserve light
[1:31:57] cuz it's going to go away.
[1:32:03] How stupid.
[1:32:06] God said, "Let there be light."
[1:32:09] [Music]
[1:32:15] After after a while, I see a clinker fly
[1:32:17] off.
[1:32:19] The first star that fell a million
[1:32:21] years.
[1:32:22] Then another one flies off. And he let
[1:32:24] it. And he's writing a Bible. God wrote
[1:32:27] three Bibles. One the zodiac, one the
[1:32:29] pyramids, and one them on paper. Right?
[1:32:32] He starts off with the virgin, ends up
[1:32:34] with Leo the lion.
[1:32:41] Jesus first coming and his second
[1:32:44] coming. If we had time, we'd run right
[1:32:47] through it and you'd see it. But he
[1:32:49] writes that because he
[1:32:52] for man to look up. God is above. Then
[1:32:56] after he gets all all the heavens and
[1:32:58] the solar systems written out, then I
[1:33:00] can see him move over a clinker over the
[1:33:02] earth and there was nothing but iceberg
[1:33:04] hanging out there. And he moves it all
[1:33:06] around the sun and as he begins to
[1:33:08] revive it around, he melts all the water
[1:33:11] and the ice on it. And the icebergs come
[1:33:14] flying through down through Texas. Texas
[1:33:17] is formed.
[1:33:21] Louisiana,
[1:33:24] brother Tim. God formed Louisiana before
[1:33:26] he did Virginia, obviously.
[1:33:30] And through there, where it scraped off
[1:33:32] and the chronological tell us that those
[1:33:35] icebergs went on and into the Gulf and
[1:33:37] so forth,
[1:33:39] the world's without form and void,
[1:33:42] right? And water was upon the deep.
[1:33:47] This quote quote means a whole lot to me
[1:33:50] because brother Biscll was quoting this
[1:33:53] quote
[1:33:55] in North Carolina and it was preaching a
[1:33:58] sermon called bringing order out of
[1:34:00] chaos and I was sitting in the balcony a
[1:34:03] year later after being burned. I
[1:34:06] couldn't walk up steps without taking
[1:34:08] breaks.
[1:34:11] And he was talking about the chaos of
[1:34:13] your life and the chaos of a cell in
[1:34:16] your body and the chaos of how sickness
[1:34:18] will hit you. And he said, "God can
[1:34:21] bring order
[1:34:23] back to that body." Listen, I didn't
[1:34:26] wait till the end of the service. I
[1:34:27] stood up right there.
[1:34:30] This quote was being formed
[1:34:33] and he was preaching this quote. I stood
[1:34:37] up in the balcony, raised my hands to
[1:34:39] God. I felt a pressure tank of air come
[1:34:42] down on me. I felt like my lungs was
[1:34:44] going to blow up.
[1:34:47] I was constantly at the doctor because
[1:34:50] of lung infections. To this day,
[1:34:55] even with cancer, I haven't had one lung
[1:34:59] infection.
[1:35:05] Hallelujah.
[1:35:07] Hallelujah.
[1:35:22] I'm trying to behave because I got a lot
[1:35:23] of ground and I'm not going to be much
[1:35:25] longer.
[1:35:30] The B says, "Standing not long ago with
[1:35:32] a friend of mine, I had the privilege of
[1:35:35] leading to Christ, Burke call
[1:35:39] in New Hampshire,
[1:35:41] a hunting partner,
[1:35:43] and he was standing by a cold brook
[1:35:47] falls up in the Aderandac,
[1:35:51] and it was such a mammoth big falls. I
[1:35:56] taken my family there last year to look
[1:35:58] at it way back from the road. You have
[1:36:01] to hike to get back there and to get to
[1:36:03] it. And he said, "When we seen that blue
[1:36:06] green water pouring with such mighty
[1:36:10] power out of the mountains, gushing down
[1:36:12] over those rocks, Bert stood there and
[1:36:15] looked at me and he said, "Gee, Billy,
[1:36:18] it makes a man feel just real little."
[1:36:21] Amen. And he measured about a quarter of
[1:36:24] an inch on his fingers. And I said,
[1:36:26] "That's right, Bert."
[1:36:30] That was all that he knowed of getting
[1:36:32] into the presence of God to see his
[1:36:35] creation. Amen.
[1:36:38] And I wonder the man who wrote how great
[1:36:40] there art
[1:36:42] if he didn't look up one night and look
[1:36:44] at the stars and how far they are away.
[1:36:48] A few months ago, Brother Fred and
[1:36:50] Brother Wood and I was standing with
[1:36:52] Brother Mclli
[1:36:54] out in the Arizona desert and he was
[1:36:57] measuring trying one star to see how
[1:36:59] close the other one was and with a
[1:37:02] millions and billions of miles apart.
[1:37:07] They didn't look like they were a
[1:37:09] quarter of a inch from each other. Then
[1:37:12] we begin to think according to the
[1:37:15] scientific proof those stars are
[1:37:18] probably farther away from each other
[1:37:21] than we are from them.
[1:37:27] Then we can realize
[1:37:30] how little we are when we realize how
[1:37:34] great
[1:37:35] he is.
[1:37:39] I know you want to shout, but just hang
[1:37:41] with me just a couple more minutes.
[1:37:49] He said, "I think
[1:37:51] if a person would look up toward the
[1:37:53] skies,
[1:37:55] you might cry like a that Swedish author
[1:37:58] of that song, how great thou art." Amen.
[1:38:04] to see those little stars maybe that
[1:38:06] don't look like they're four inches
[1:38:07] apart in the skies and yet they're
[1:38:10] further
[1:38:12] from each other than we are from them.
[1:38:16] And he said, "And yet
[1:38:19] God controls it all."
[1:38:31] Me too.
[1:38:33] Me too.
[1:38:36] He said there was never one like him
[1:38:39] on earth and never will be. He was
[1:38:42] Emmanuel.
[1:38:44] He was alpha and omega.
[1:38:48] The beginning and the end.
[1:38:52] He that was, which is, and shall come,
[1:38:56] the root and the offang spring of David,
[1:39:00] the morning star.
[1:39:02] In him dwell the fullness of God,
[1:39:08] God. Jehovah,
[1:39:10] our savior, Emmanuel, the door of the
[1:39:13] sheepfold, he that was, which is, and
[1:39:16] which shall come,
[1:39:19] the lily of the valley. Oh God, how
[1:39:23] wonderful. No matter Isa no wonder
[1:39:26] Isaiah said counselor prince of peace
[1:39:30] the mighty God
[1:39:35] Jeff can you hear me back there he's a
[1:39:38] mighty God
[1:39:40] those doctors they have limits but we
[1:39:43] got a high physician that's a mighty God
[1:40:04] Oh my.
[1:40:07] The scripture says, "In the beginning
[1:40:09] was the word,
[1:40:11] and the word was with God,
[1:40:14] and the word was God." Amen. and the
[1:40:17] word was made flesh and manifested unto
[1:40:20] us.
[1:40:26] That's a that's a way to explain God,
[1:40:28] isn't it?
[1:40:30] I bet you when he wrote that down, I bet
[1:40:34] you he danced for an hour
[1:40:38] when that was released. I bet he had an
[1:40:40] oldfashioned shouting jubilee.
[1:40:44] I can't believe what just came to my
[1:40:47] heart. That's right.
[1:40:50] I can't believe it.
[1:40:53] Because if you're in God, you have all
[1:40:56] of that at your disposal.
[1:41:06] In 1 Timothy chapter 3 and verse 16,
[1:41:09] without controversy,
[1:41:12] great is the mystery of godliness.
[1:41:15] For God was manifested in flesh, handle
[1:41:19] with our hands God.
[1:41:22] Jehovah,
[1:41:25] it's astounding.
[1:41:27] It's startling to think that God who put
[1:41:31] the solar system into space and made the
[1:41:35] stars
[1:41:39] stars that is a thousand times bigger
[1:41:42] than this world. Amen.
[1:41:47] You're going on vacation. Some of you
[1:41:49] going on vacation this year
[1:41:53] and you go, I I want to I want to see
[1:41:55] something astounding. Everywhere you go
[1:41:58] has its own beauty. Amen.
[1:42:02] If you go to the desert, it's got its
[1:42:04] own duty. You go to the mountains,
[1:42:07] they've got their own duty. That's
[1:42:08] right. We live here in the Shannondo
[1:42:11] Valley and it's got its own duty. Amen.
[1:42:14] Amen. When you go west to the Rockies,
[1:42:17] it's got its own beauty.
[1:42:20] Hallelujah.
[1:42:22] No matter what park that you go to that
[1:42:24] our nation has preserved, it's got its
[1:42:26] own beauty.
[1:42:28] And you can stand there and go.
[1:42:34] Thank you, Lord.
[1:42:37] There's a train in Canada. I haven't had
[1:42:39] the opportunity to do it on my bucket
[1:42:41] list.
[1:42:42] bucket keeps filling up.
[1:42:46] Praise the Lord.
[1:42:47] And and it's a train to where that the
[1:42:50] top is glass and they they take you from
[1:42:54] Vancouver all the way into Calgary and
[1:42:57] then further
[1:42:59] and you can just sit there and every
[1:43:02] turn of that train has a new sight.
[1:43:07] Amen. A friend of mine was on that train
[1:43:11] and he said, "I didn't want to go to
[1:43:13] sleep."
[1:43:17] He said, "I didn't want to go to sleep."
[1:43:19] And it was a long time to be on that
[1:43:21] train. I didn't want to go to sleep cuz
[1:43:23] I didn't want to miss nothing.
[1:43:26] I kind of feel the same way. We have
[1:43:28] such a great big God.
[1:43:31] [Applause]
[1:43:40] I've gave this some thought through the
[1:43:41] years and it's kind of been on a wish
[1:43:43] list. Sometime in heaven, sometime I it
[1:43:47] don't have to be at the first of heaven.
[1:43:48] Don't and there's no end.
[1:43:53] I like for God to show me how he did it.
[1:44:02] and he blowed all of those stars off of
[1:44:05] his fingertips.
[1:44:09] Brother Ron, that's just way farfetched.
[1:44:11] That's what he said.
[1:44:14] That's what he said. That's what he
[1:44:17] said.
[1:44:20] Maybe I'll end it like this.
[1:44:24] There's no other church has had a
[1:44:27] a prophet like we've had.
[1:44:30] I mean, he's not
[1:44:32] He's not one of the boys
[1:44:34] yet. He was man.
[1:44:43] I was at Billy Andrews one time. Let me
[1:44:44] tell this before I go further. I was at
[1:44:46] Billy Andrews one time and AA Allen's
[1:44:50] organ player was there.
[1:44:54] He knew Billy because he had played for
[1:44:56] Billy and Billy had huge tents and they
[1:45:00] they worked together sometimes.
[1:45:03] And so he was at the meeting and I
[1:45:05] preached and he enjoyed it and wanted to
[1:45:07] be around me a little bit. And so we
[1:45:09] went over to
[1:45:11] uh Billy's organ player's house. He's pa
[1:45:14] he's passed now, Brother Baxter.
[1:45:19] And I asked him, I said, 'You played
[1:45:22] while Brother Brandham preached. ' Yeah,
[1:45:25] I did.
[1:45:27] I said, 'I have a question for you.
[1:45:30] What' you think of Brother Brandham? Cuz
[1:45:32] AA Allen preached 100 miles an hour,
[1:45:35] stomp, jump, run all over the place,
[1:45:37] climb poles. Amen. I said, "What'd you
[1:45:41] think about Brother Brandham?" He said,
[1:45:43] "He was a slow speaker.
[1:45:46] He's just real slow. Real deliberate.
[1:45:49] You know,
[1:45:52] I said, "Is that what you got out of
[1:45:53] it?" Brother Brown was a slow speaker.
[1:45:55] He said, "Never one like him." Amen.
[1:46:00] Never one like him. He said, you know,
[1:46:02] and he just he just went on and I
[1:46:04] figured I'd just let him talk. He said,
[1:46:06] you know, he said when he would back off
[1:46:10] and say, I take every spirit in this
[1:46:13] building under my control,
[1:46:17] he said, I have never witnessed nothing
[1:46:22] like it.
[1:46:25] He said he had a stage presence like no
[1:46:29] other man. I said, "Did you see the
[1:46:32] angel?" He said, "No, but I sure felt
[1:46:34] him.
[1:46:36] And he said, "I witnessed miracle after
[1:46:38] miracle after miracle." Tell them where
[1:46:41] they came from and what their address
[1:46:42] was and what the doctor had told them.
[1:46:45] And
[1:46:49] listen to a tape today.
[1:46:53] And brother Brandham is praying for a
[1:46:54] woman and the doctors couldn't tell you
[1:46:58] what was wrong with this woman. She had
[1:47:01] went everywhere
[1:47:04] to find out what was wrong with her.
[1:47:06] Didn't have a guy like you in the MRI
[1:47:08] staff.
[1:47:11] And so
[1:47:13] she comes before brother Brandham
[1:47:16] and he said, "They haven't been able to
[1:47:18] find out what's wrong with you."
[1:47:21] I want you to watch what he does. He
[1:47:24] says, "I see when you were a little
[1:47:26] girl, you fell down in a well.
[1:47:30] And you fell so hard it caused all your
[1:47:33] organs inside to cut loose.
[1:47:40] That's what your problem is.
[1:47:46] Listen to that woman
[1:47:50] that had been in all them doctors.
[1:47:54] Brother Ron, I don't know so much about
[1:47:56] it. She knew.
[1:47:59] She knew.
[1:48:00] I'm coming to your address. She knew
[1:48:04] when she felt her organs go back into
[1:48:06] place.
[1:48:20] Brother Ron, but I I I need a quote for
[1:48:22] that. Well, let me just go back into the
[1:48:24] scriptures. There was a woman knew that
[1:48:26] there was nobody that could help her.
[1:48:29] And she'd had this condition for 12
[1:48:31] years. And she caught a revelation. If I
[1:48:34] can get to where he's at,
[1:48:37] I don't want him to become unclean. Let
[1:48:40] me just touch the hem of his garment.
[1:48:47] How big is your God? All I need to do is
[1:48:50] touch the hem of his garment.
[1:48:53] She knew. She knew. She knew
[1:49:00] in that moment.
[1:49:15] One more.
[1:49:22] There's a bunch of false gods trying to
[1:49:24] stop the meeting. They've tried over and
[1:49:27] over and over to stop the meeting.
[1:49:31] And there's a man that's standing now
[1:49:33] before brother Brandham blind
[1:49:36] because of worshiping the sun.
[1:49:41] Brother Brandham sees a vision
[1:49:44] cuz God is so big. He will show you the
[1:49:48] future.
[1:49:54] Brother Ram sees this man well
[1:49:59] and he turns to the audience
[1:50:03] and he was going to prove how big God
[1:50:06] is.
[1:50:09] Let me just say this to you. Had it have
[1:50:12] failed, I wouldn't be here. Right.
[1:50:19] Had it have failed, none of us would be
[1:50:21] in this building today? That's right.
[1:50:24] And brother Brandham asked them, "Which
[1:50:27] of your gods
[1:50:29] can come heal this man?"
[1:50:32] Listen, there's people for the
[1:50:34] generations and hundreds of years have
[1:50:36] worshiped their dead gods.
[1:50:39] And now the prophet of God has said,
[1:50:41] "Which of you gods?"
[1:50:44] Amen. Can come heal this man.
[1:50:48] Maybe he was a peasant. Maybe he was a
[1:50:50] poorest person in the building. But God
[1:50:52] had him standing there to prove God.
[1:50:57] How long you been blind? Don't matter.
[1:51:06] Which are your gods? He gave them time.
[1:51:13] Which of your gods
[1:51:15] can come and heal him?
[1:51:21] I bet that was the stealest bunch of
[1:51:22] preachers,
[1:51:24] God worshippers there was with their
[1:51:27] chants and all their nonsense. They got
[1:51:29] quiet. Amen.
[1:51:32] And then
[1:51:34] brother Bam begins to pray.
[1:51:37] Brother Biscll asked Brother Brandham
[1:51:40] about that event.
[1:51:44] He said, 'I looked at him and he said he
[1:51:46] had dark hair with his blind eyes, but
[1:51:51] in the vision he had white hair
[1:51:55] coming down his brow and he could see.
[1:52:00] He said, "So I knew he was going to get
[1:52:02] well." Right.
[1:52:06] Come on, church.
[1:52:08] Listen, we can look at the word and the
[1:52:09] vision of the word. We know where we're
[1:52:12] going to be. We ain't guessing.
[1:52:16] We're not probing at it.
[1:52:21] I am going to sit at a table 1500 miles
[1:52:25] long.
[1:52:26] I am going to be at the marriage supper
[1:52:28] of the lamb. I am going to get a new
[1:52:31] body. It ain't a guess.
[1:52:34] Our God is a great big God.
[1:52:40] Give him praise in the house of the
[1:52:42] Lord.
[1:52:45] Give him praise in the house of the
[1:52:46] Lord.
[1:53:01] You can keep your standing. The
[1:53:03] musicians can come.
[1:53:05] But the trouble that you walked in here
[1:53:07] with tonight is no bigger than a grain
[1:53:10] of sand. Amen. Compared to my God,
[1:53:21] this sermon means a whole lot to me.
[1:53:23] Amen. Because I'm preaching faith to Ron
[1:53:25] Spencer. Amen.
[1:53:28] Come on. I'm preaching faith to you.
[1:53:32] I'm preaching faith to you for you and
[1:53:34] your family and your children.
[1:53:38] Kids, your God's a great big God. And
[1:53:41] you will never be able to figure out how
[1:53:43] big he is. He fills all time, space, and
[1:53:47] eternity.
[1:53:51] Yet, there's not an ant that he can't
[1:53:54] count.
[1:53:57] You guys trying to kill all them ants
[1:53:59] that God made.
[1:54:01] [Applause]
[1:54:06] Kill them. Kill them.
[1:54:11] Brother George Quinn is probably
[1:54:14] watching. Brother George Quinn pointed
[1:54:17] me to a house of a scientist that
[1:54:22] studied 40 years. 40 years. 40
[1:54:27] on cockroaches.
[1:54:31] 40 years.
[1:54:36] Cockroaches. What' you do in your
[1:54:38] career?
[1:54:40] Cockroaches.
[1:54:44] He spent his entire work life
[1:54:49] trying to figure out cockroaches
[1:54:52] that God spoke into existence. Let there
[1:54:55] be.
[1:54:58] Now, God just didn't make elephants,
[1:55:02] dinosaurs for our kids. Yeah, there
[1:55:05] were.
[1:55:07] Brother Bon said they roam the earth
[1:55:09] while Adam was here.
[1:55:12] That's why you find their bones. Thank
[1:55:14] God they ain't in Shannido Valley
[1:55:17] tonight.
[1:55:20] Amen. How was your trip home? Well, a
[1:55:22] terrestaurus.
[1:55:32] I may have just made up a word.
[1:55:44] God just didn't make them,
[1:55:47] but he made gnats.
[1:55:49] We'll understand it better by and by.
[1:55:53] He made mosquitoes.
[1:56:01] I'm not here to answer questions for you
[1:56:03] tonight. I don't have a box for you to
[1:56:05] put a question in.
[1:56:08] But greater than all that, he made you
[1:56:16] and he pre-planned you,
[1:56:21] Jonathan, because inside of you,
[1:56:24] he put a place about the size of a
[1:56:26] button.
[1:56:28] And one day,
[1:56:31] oh, the old book was gone. And one day
[1:56:35] God ignited that seed that had been
[1:56:37] there set the foundation of the world.
[1:56:41] Since before God said, "Let there be."
[1:56:46] Amen. And it came to life and God said,
[1:56:51] "I'm going to live inside of you."
[1:56:54] Now listen, if you figure this out,
[1:56:58] you will treat yourself better.
[1:57:01] Amen. That's right. Amen.
[1:57:06] If I don't say nothing else tonight,
[1:57:08] tomorrow, if you figure out that go D,
[1:57:13] capital lives on the inside of you, you
[1:57:18] will treat yourself better.
[1:57:22] Brother Ron, that's a far-fetched
[1:57:23] statement. Don't kidding me. If
[1:57:25] President Biden walked into this
[1:57:27] building, we'd have respect for him.
[1:57:29] We'd treat him right. We'd get him the
[1:57:31] best seat.
[1:57:35] Some king walked in there. You get him
[1:57:37] the best seat. You take care of him.
[1:57:41] The king of glory.
[1:57:45] The God of gods
[1:57:47] wants to live in your heart.
[1:57:51] That's why you got a responsibility to
[1:57:54] treat one another.
[1:57:57] Love one another.
[1:58:04] Soon and very soon
[1:58:07] we are going to see the king.
[1:58:11] Soon and very soon we are going to see
[1:58:15] the king.
