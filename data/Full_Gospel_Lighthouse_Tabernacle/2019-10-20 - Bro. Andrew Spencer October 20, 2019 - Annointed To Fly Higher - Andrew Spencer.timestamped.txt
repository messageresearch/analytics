[6:13] goddess it's got his arms completely
[6:16] surrounding you tonight maybe you got a
[6:22] little issue or maybe you got a little
[6:24] circumstance that you can't figure out
[6:26] but I I encourage you to set your wings
[6:29] to the winds of faith tonight hey man
[6:32] let's call them the God of heaven Lord
[6:35] what a privilege it is for us to bow our
[6:37] heads as your children before the dust
[6:40] of the earth from which we came
[6:42] Lord realizing that we're nothing Lord
[6:45] Jesus but 16 elements but in that 16
[6:49] elements lays a soul that's worth 10,000
[6:52] world's a soul that is longing for more
[6:56] of you a soul that is desiring to to
[7:00] just express what you mean to us tonight
[7:04] there's such a soul that desires for you
[7:06] to fill us up Lord like never before
[7:09] that makes us a value tonight that you
[7:12] had fleece that gene seat of God in us
[7:14] Lord Jesus to think that you thought of
[7:17] us before the world began and to think
[7:20] that we as mortals have the opportunity
[7:24] to serve an immortal God oh god I pray
[7:28] that we would do it with justice tonight
[7:30] the Lord I counted a privilege to stand
[7:32] behind this desk of Lord one more time
[7:35] to speak to you Bride of Christ Lord I'm
[7:38] not worthy and myself Lord these any of
[7:42] the righteous knives righteousness that
[7:44] I have is filthy rags the Lord I don't
[7:47] stand here upon my own merits nor do I
[7:49] stand here upon my own works
[7:51] I stand here upon the basis of your word
[7:53] and upon the shed blood father a stand
[7:56] here Lord as as a part of the bride of
[7:59] Jesus Christ that you said was spotless
[8:01] was blameless was pure and holy
[8:05] and Father Lord I pray that you would
[8:07] speak to your children tonight Lord
[8:10] through your word Lord I know that the
[8:12] things that these things that I've
[8:14] studied Lord been on my heart I pray God
[8:17] that you would just take the human
[8:20] element out of it tonight and may you
[8:22] speak from glory tonight
[8:24] I pray you would I pray that you would
[8:27] calm every person just now I pray that
[8:30] you'd call them every child just now and
[8:32] every evil spirit I pray you're driving
[8:35] out father I pray that as we would sit
[8:38] under the auspices of your holiness and
[8:42] set here father I pray that maybe just
[8:46] one word would touch our lives Lord that
[8:50] calls us to to rise above all the
[8:53] circumstances are all the things in our
[8:55] mind that would maybe weigh us down or
[8:57] hold us back
[8:59] but father may we lay aside every weight
[9:01] and sin tonight that does so easily
[9:03] beset us and let us run this race with
[9:07] patience let's lay aside those sins sin
[9:12] is to miss the mark and if we've missed
[9:15] the mark lord I pray that we would tune
[9:18] ourselves back up and get in line with
[9:20] your word we've heard an eagle that told
[9:24] us to get back in line
[9:25] father may we hit the mark tonight
[9:29] we glorify the God of heaven we sense
[9:33] your nearness and now and Lord and we
[9:35] just want to be very careful father that
[9:38] we would never offend you not just come
[9:42] by our way tonight we pray in Jesus name
[9:45] Amen man if you have your Bibles this
[9:48] even and what turned over in the Book of
[9:50] Revelations chapter 4
[10:00] revelations chapter 4 and verse 1
[10:10] tonight I'd like to speak to you kind of
[10:14] a an anthem it's been on my heart on on
[10:17] what has been taking place amongst the
[10:20] bride of Jesus Christ and just amongst
[10:22] us and I like to just title this little
[10:26] fall tonight on anoint it anoint it to
[10:28] fly higher I don't want it to fly higher
[10:37] after this I looked and behold a door
[10:41] was open in heaven and the first voice
[10:44] which I heard was as it were of a
[10:46] trumpet talking with me which said come
[10:49] up hither and I will show thee things
[10:52] which must be Hereafter
[10:54] and immediately I was in the spirit and
[10:57] behold a throne was set in heaven and
[10:59] one sat on the throne verse 7 we've
[11:03] already read enough here to shut down
[11:06] every turn it's arian tonight and one
[11:09] set on the throne verse 7 and the first
[11:12] beast was like a lion and the second
[11:14] beast like a calf and the third beast
[11:16] had a face as a man and the fourth beast
[11:20] was like a flying eagle may God bless
[11:23] his word he may be seated this evening
[11:26] man mm-hmm I ask for your complete
[11:29] attention this evening just as we would
[11:33] lay just a little bit of a foundation
[11:35] here this evening as we move into the
[11:37] the thought here that God's placed on
[11:41] our hearts we understand and know that
[11:43] we are living in one of the greatest
[11:46] hours that there ever has been upon the
[11:49] face of the earth to be living in we're
[11:51] living in an hour when when the prophet
[11:53] of God would would say that that if I
[11:56] could choose any other day to live in I
[11:58] would choose to live in this day we're
[12:00] living in an hour when everything is
[12:02] moving higher when we are seeing the the
[12:05] advancement of science and we watch
[12:08] those things from a vision of 1933 how
[12:12] that those things have
[12:13] trans fold it before us and we've seen
[12:15] those things literally
[12:16] become manifest in our eyes everything
[12:19] is moving higher you watch man and man
[12:22] he is always trying to outdo himself if
[12:25] he if a man sets a record he's going to
[12:27] try to break that record if if you watch
[12:30] a man he's constantly trying to build
[12:32] something that is higher there there in
[12:34] New York and over in Beijing in
[12:36] different places they are still trying
[12:38] to outdo one another and building
[12:40] skyscrapers and there it's a constant
[12:43] it's a constant moving of a to a higher
[12:46] level and I think that it is depicting
[12:49] of what we are doing as a body of Christ
[12:52] that that what we are seeing in the
[12:54] natural we are also seeing in the
[12:56] spiritual as well and brother branham
[12:59] would say about this age that it's a
[13:01] it's an age that is reaching for
[13:03] something but they can't find what
[13:05] they're looking for and hey you look
[13:07] everywhere you look in the hospitals and
[13:09] you look in the insane asylums or in the
[13:11] st. institutions and you find people
[13:13] that are there dissatisfied it's overrun
[13:16] with people that are dissatisfied and if
[13:18] you've ever been there you watch
[13:19] somebody in those nursing homes are in
[13:21] insane institutions that they're always
[13:23] kind of reaching out for something or
[13:25] trying and they're moaning trying to get
[13:27] back to something they're there reaching
[13:29] out for something you see there's
[13:30] something that is lacking in their life
[13:33] and they're trying to reach out for it
[13:35] you see that place what was placed on
[13:38] the inside of them for for a as a a
[13:41] throne room for God to set you see they
[13:43] had not satisfied that first with his
[13:46] calling
[13:47] but they they were sitting there in a
[13:49] dissatisfied spot and that's where
[13:51] America is at they're in a spot of
[13:53] dissatisfaction where where they're
[13:56] never happy where they're living at you
[13:58] watching you watch people that build
[14:00] their houses you watch somebody they'll
[14:02] build a house today and in five years
[14:04] they got to build a bigger house so or
[14:06] they get a car today and they get a get
[14:08] a new gotta get a new car you see it's
[14:10] because there is a pattern there's a
[14:12] matching time when everybody wants to be
[14:15] like everybody else who they want to
[14:16] move higher and truly that we do want to
[14:19] move higher as human being
[14:20] we don't want to be complacent in our in
[14:23] our walk do we we don't want to be
[14:25] complacent and where we are is where we
[14:27] live we don't even want to stay with the
[14:29] same pay rate that we got ten years ago
[14:31] we want to move higher in that I'd say
[14:34] every human being that's here tonight
[14:36] would agree that you would like a raise
[14:37] in your future but you see you're
[14:40] looking for something that is that is
[14:42] moving you higher and men are looking
[14:44] for jobs that will move them higher in a
[14:47] place of position but tonight I have the
[14:49] opportunity to speak to a people that
[14:52] has been placed in position before the
[14:54] foundation of the world is higher than
[14:57] any governor it's higher than any
[14:59] senator it's higher than any president
[15:01] it's higher than any Pope I am speaking
[15:03] to sons and daughters of God that have
[15:06] more power than any Archangel there is
[15:09] in heaven you have that much power you
[15:14] see and Satan longed Satan II when you
[15:17] look at it when you see Satan he longed
[15:20] to have that tower which you have he
[15:23] looked at it when he was there in heaven
[15:25] and he wanted to be like God and God had
[15:28] to kick him out he had to kick him out
[15:30] of heaven because he was trying to exalt
[15:32] himself and move higher than what God is
[15:35] and if we are not thinking try to move
[15:38] ourselves higher than what God is doing
[15:40] God will kick us out but you know how I
[15:44] realize that God is showing us something
[15:46] that God kicked Satan out of heaven in
[15:50] the beginning where sin was created
[15:52] where where sin was where where sin
[15:55] originated as it were it originated in
[15:58] heaven and God had to kick Satan out and
[16:01] every time you watch a Satan begins to
[16:03] raise himself higher in your life it is
[16:06] your duty as the army of God to kick
[16:09] Satan out as he tries to exalt himself
[16:11] in your life is that right I have a lift
[16:19] thee quote here I ask the brothers to
[16:20] put up with us this evening from the
[16:23] Laodicean Church age he says how strange
[16:26] in this age of plenty in this age of
[16:28] progress in this age of abundance
[16:32] how can there be trials well now it's it
[16:35] is strange but in this age of Plenty and
[16:37] opportunity when everyone is so much and
[16:40] there is so much more to be had what
[16:43] with all of these inventions to do our
[16:44] work and so many things that give us
[16:46] pleasure suddenly we find mental illness
[16:49] taking such a toll as to alarm the
[16:52] nation when everybody ought to be happy
[16:55] with really nothing to be unhappy about
[16:56] millions are taking sedatives at night
[16:59] and pet pills in the morning rushing the
[17:01] doctors entering institutions are trying
[17:04] to drown out unknown fears by alcohol
[17:06] yes this aids boast of of its tremendous
[17:09] stores of a worldly goods but the people
[17:12] are less happy than ever before this
[17:14] aids boast of its spiritual attainments
[17:17] but the people are less sure themselves
[17:19] than ever this aids boast of my better
[17:22] moral values and it is more corrupt than
[17:24] any age since the flood it talks about
[17:27] its knowledge in science but it is
[17:29] fighting a losing battle in all fields
[17:31] for the human mind and soul and spirit
[17:33] cannot comprehend or keep abreast with
[17:37] all the changes that have come upon the
[17:39] earth in one generation we have gone all
[17:42] the way from the horse and buggy age to
[17:44] the space age and we are proud and vote
[17:47] boastful about it but inside it is a
[17:50] dark lloyd cavern that is crying out in
[17:52] torment and without a known reason men's
[17:55] hearts are failing for fear and the
[17:57] world is so darkened that this age could
[18:00] well be called the age of neurotics it
[18:02] boasts but it cannot back it up it
[18:05] crosspiece but then there is no peace it
[18:08] cries that it has a great amplitude of
[18:09] all things but it keeps burning with
[18:12] desire like an unsatisfied fire there is
[18:15] no peace saith my god to the wicked as
[18:19] far as as we are as advanced as human
[18:22] beings you will find that you are more
[18:24] stressed than ever before you'll find
[18:27] that you are you have lost your joy like
[18:30] never before but not to us
[18:33] you'll find that you that you'll sign
[18:36] that you'll see that the farther we go
[18:38] it seems like the more that we are
[18:40] depleted of our energies but you see
[18:44] science has taken man forward and more
[18:46] forward greater things with his mind
[18:49] whether than what then the thing that
[18:51] only and that's the only thing he has is
[18:54] that tree of knowledge farther than
[18:56] minister has taken in with the spirit
[18:58] which is unlimited but here it is that
[19:00] science ain't looking back to what
[19:03] science said a few years ago science has
[19:06] taken what they got now and moving
[19:07] forward for something else you see
[19:10] you'll find that man is always moving
[19:12] forward science is always moving forward
[19:15] and to think that that brother Brandon
[19:18] would say that men like Einstein was
[19:21] breaking in to God's laboratory they
[19:24] were trying to progress higher than what
[19:26] God was now as we go back to our
[19:30] scripture reading we we notice here that
[19:32] these four anointings that we see them
[19:35] they're of the of a of the line and the
[19:38] ox and the man anointing and the ego
[19:40] anointing we understand that those
[19:42] anointings are of the same Holy Ghost
[19:44] that it's the Holy Ghost behind every
[19:47] one of them anointing in a different
[19:49] Avenue and we're taught that there in
[19:51] the in the book and in the New Testament
[19:53] where Matthew Mark Luke and John that
[19:56] they are the four guards to the the book
[19:59] of Acts to the move of God they're
[20:01] guarding the moving of the Holy Ghost
[20:04] and we see here that those four
[20:06] anointings that if you'll go back in the
[20:09] Bible you can see it over and ezq and
[20:11] Daniel in the Book of Revelations that
[20:13] you'll see that those four anointings
[20:15] that they're always looking forward
[20:17] those anointings are not looking
[20:19] backwards those anointings are looking
[20:21] to each other but those anointings are
[20:23] looking forward they're not looking
[20:25] backward to another day the eagle
[20:27] anointing is not looking back to the
[20:29] mandate and the mandate is not looking
[20:31] back to the Ox age and the arts age is
[20:33] not looking back to the lion age but
[20:36] every one of them is looking forward
[20:37] that's why we cannot move back to to the
[20:41] restoration of gifts and we cannot move
[20:44] - Wesley stay and loo Thursday what good
[20:47] would it us do us tonight if I stood
[20:49] here and I preached you that the just
[20:51] shall live by faith but there was no
[20:53] Holy Ghost that would come upon that
[20:55] what good would it have done for Wesley
[20:58] to come with the same message that
[21:00] Luther had already preached it would
[21:01] have not move him any higher in their
[21:03] progress of spiritual revelation it
[21:06] would just been speech
[21:07] preaching and speaking on the same level
[21:09] that they already were but God's Word
[21:12] was taking his children higher just like
[21:15] it would have done Moses no good
[21:17] to preach Noah's message of I'm gonna go
[21:19] out here and I'm gonna build an ark it
[21:21] would have done no good Moses could have
[21:23] built an ark but it would have done no
[21:25] good because I was coming no flood - Roz
[21:28] then I work out of its place it would
[21:33] have done no good to come of that type
[21:35] of message but Moses had become of his
[21:38] message David had become of his message
[21:40] I say I had to come with his message and
[21:43] in this day we cannot be standing here
[21:45] upon the experiences of our grandfathers
[21:49] and our great-grandfather's we've got to
[21:51] have our own fresh revival fresh tonight
[21:54] fresh tomorrow fresh the next day we
[21:57] gotta move on we can't go back Naruto
[22:07] every age has went higher in Revelation
[22:10] every ages went higher we came through
[22:16] man's day and you look at those men that
[22:18] that were standing in that day like
[22:20] Wesley and standing there like Charles
[22:22] Spurgeon it all of those men like Finney
[22:25] you had never seen such a moving such a
[22:28] moving of a revival like you had in that
[22:31] day men that were so deep in the word
[22:33] but yet they could not see like an eagle
[22:36] could see you see it was not the time
[22:39] for the eagle
[22:41] men that could stand there and preach
[22:43] thousands upon thousands of sermons and
[22:45] never grow old
[22:47] I'm preaching that word but they could
[22:49] not see that wrath
[22:50] they preach the rapture but they could
[22:53] not see the rapture you see you see
[22:56] there was a moving on from the
[22:57] mayonnaise to the Eagle aids but there
[23:00] is no more powers after that equal
[23:03] there's no more anointings after that
[23:05] eagle it is showing you that it is time
[23:08] for a rapture
[23:11] [Applause]
[23:13] hallelujah
[23:14] it's hey I'm going to go back to the
[23:16] mayonnaise I have to tell you that if
[23:18] you want to stay in the man age if you
[23:19] have no ego anointing you have no
[23:22] rapture we know that in revelations
[23:28] chapter four that John he symbolizes
[23:31] that the whole book of Revelation is a
[23:34] book of symbols and that john symbolizes
[23:37] the bride of all seven ages who receives
[23:39] that car to come up higher this
[23:42] symbolizes the rapture a rap stirring of
[23:45] the body the rapturing of the bride and
[23:47] there is a spiritual aspect to that call
[23:50] that has allowed us to see by the
[23:53] revelation of the hour that these things
[23:56] here they these things here are
[23:57] described but we know here by the
[24:00] preaching of the Prophet that we know
[24:02] that revelations chapter four is an
[24:05] eternal type of the bride physically
[24:08] raptured at the end of the seventh h is
[24:12] that right is that right but we have
[24:16] heard just like as it said John said
[24:19] come up hither and is showing you as a
[24:22] type of the bride moving out of this
[24:25] destination out of this realm into
[24:28] another realm but there is a spiritual
[24:30] aspect that is laying there in that
[24:32] scripture there is a screaming eagle
[24:34] that has screamed out and called out her
[24:37] name and said you can't stay down there
[24:40] in those denominations stay down in
[24:43] there and those Creed's we have heard
[24:45] these Eagle scream to come up higher I'm
[24:49] not satisfied staying down in the
[24:51] tricking yard I'm
[24:52] frye where eagles fly i was not knowing
[24:56] it for this hour hallelujah this Eagle
[25:02] scream has called us up higher pass the
[25:05] corn allottee a man and it's placed us
[25:08] in our position we know that that air in
[25:12] the in the seals that that when the
[25:14] rider would go forth and I know that
[25:16] there's some things that are said here
[25:17] but I want you to know it's not over
[25:19] your head tonight this was brought to
[25:21] you you can go to the library down here
[25:24] and you can find all types of books but
[25:26] there's no book like there like there is
[25:29] on the revelation of the seven seals as
[25:31] thus saith the Lord this is not above
[25:35] your head I hear some people say well I
[25:37] can't dive into those things because
[25:38] it's too deep it's not too deep for you
[25:41] it's for you right here is where Eagles
[25:46] gather if it's too deep too for you then
[25:51] why would he have a hillbilly Kentucky
[25:54] and preach you this message it's for you
[25:57] tonight I want you to say those words
[25:59] it's for me tonight but when we see that
[26:03] those were that the riders when a seal
[26:05] was broke that there would be a rider
[26:07] that would go forth and when that rider
[26:09] would go forth in that political power
[26:11] or that anointing that there would come
[26:14] an anointing or a power to go out in the
[26:16] first stage when there would have when
[26:18] there went out a white horse rider
[26:19] you'll notice that white that white
[26:21] horse rider was going out and he had he
[26:24] had a bull but he had no arrows through
[26:26] that boat and if you watch it's the same
[26:28] Antichrist spirit that travels its way
[26:31] all the way up and every time that
[26:34] errata went out there went forth and
[26:36] anointing out after it to come back to
[26:39] come back the power that was sent out by
[26:42] the Antichrist spirit Oh hallelujah
[26:45] that's why I can stand here tonight
[26:47] under this ego anointing under this age
[26:50] and protest to you and proclaim to you
[26:53] that there is a God there's a mighty
[26:55] angel that's standing right here tonight
[26:57] that's an eagle anointing here tonight
[27:00] that over that will come
[27:02] every spirit of hell that will combat
[27:05] every disease of hell this anointing
[27:07] will break every sin every bondage of
[27:10] sin this anointing is here it's not
[27:15] coming it's here hallelujah you see we
[27:23] understand these things because we're
[27:24] not looking through the eye of a man
[27:26] we're looking through the eye of an
[27:28] eagle hallelujah maybe I'll say it to
[27:33] you like this that faith is higher than
[27:35] now that faith takes you higher than
[27:40] words could ever move you can we agree
[27:43] tonight that healing is higher than
[27:45] diseases healing is higher than diseases
[27:50] but we will allow the stupid devil to
[27:53] try to choke us down with diseases upon
[27:55] diseases healing is higher than that
[27:58] move past that disease smite that devil
[28:02] that keeps holding you bail your healing
[28:06] is greater than that sickness your
[28:08] healing is greater than that disease
[28:10] your healing is greater than the
[28:12] tormentor
[28:20] can we say that faith is higher than
[28:24] fear that deliverance is higher than
[28:27] bondage and our joy is higher than
[28:32] sorrow and Revelation is higher than
[28:35] intellectualism you see if you're
[28:39] sitting in that condition of
[28:40] intellectualism like Paul was sitting in
[28:43] he said in the same spot of
[28:45] intellectualism is as a lot of people do
[28:48] in the message today they sit there and
[28:50] they proclaim their message relievers
[28:51] they can tell you about they they can
[28:53] tell you about the Angels they can tell
[28:55] you about the 42-inch caribou they can
[28:57] tell you about the meeting back there
[28:58] and Sabina they can tell you all those
[29:00] things but they have no life to back it
[29:04] up they're selling at an intellectual
[29:07] conception but I got good news for you
[29:10] brother branham made a statement in 1955
[29:12] he said intellectual conception will
[29:14] never do but it will bring you to the
[29:17] Holy Ghost you ain't with far enough in
[29:20] your intellectual conception but move on
[29:23] just a little bit further move on past
[29:26] your thoughts you can't figure it out
[29:28] anyway
[29:30] [Applause]
[29:35] if you said in that intellectual
[29:37] condition I I had mana shoe to fly a
[29:39] little bit higher Paul had to fly a
[29:42] little bit higher and when he got
[29:44] knocked off of his high horse
[29:46] he stopped flying with buzzards and he
[29:48] started flying with Eagles he didn't
[29:51] want no pilot with Peter he didn't want
[29:53] no power James but when he met the
[29:55] pillar fire he was no longer identified
[29:58] with that bunch of buzzards that down
[30:00] there in Jerusalem and all of their high
[30:02] cities and all those things he was
[30:03] identified with a bunch of eagles it may
[30:06] have been a little bitty group but he
[30:08] was flying with Eagles and he was no
[30:10] longer flying with buses
[30:17] we're seeing through the eyes of a
[30:19] prophet and there is no higher order
[30:21] than a prophet in the land you know but
[30:25] there's something on the inside of you
[30:27] as a believer that leads you to a higher
[30:30] calling this message has led you and
[30:33] will take you higher it'll take you
[30:35] higher in your thinking higher in your
[30:38] speech higher in your dress higher in
[30:42] your life this message will take you
[30:44] higher in your praise hiring your
[30:47] worship higher in your attitude this
[30:49] message takes you to a new level of
[30:52] faith hello somebody it's a perfect
[30:58] faith it's not something that's snapped
[31:01] up that you can't get it's a common
[31:03] faith it's right there for you
[31:08] sometimes we think it's way up here when
[31:11] it's right here when it's right there on
[31:13] your level God has brought it down to
[31:16] your level so the littlest child could
[31:18] grab it tonight a little child tonight
[31:21] could stand here on this pulpit and tell
[31:25] you that cancers a liar and have the
[31:27] same authority as I've got little women
[31:31] that stand there at the window washing
[31:34] dishes doing the laundries got the same
[31:36] authority to call a devil devil and a
[31:39] disease a disease you're anointed to do
[31:45] so
[31:45] [Applause]
[31:51] hallelujah we're looking through the
[31:52] eyes of an eagle because the Bible tells
[31:55] us her name is 3 and 7 that surely the
[31:57] Lord thy God would do nothing but he
[32:00] revealed his secret unto his servants
[32:02] the prophets we're looking who are
[32:05] looking through the eyes of an eagle
[32:06] tonight turning me over to Deuteronomy 1
[32:10] & 6
[32:13] here we are breaking in after the 40th
[32:17] year that God was telling the children
[32:19] of Eire so it's time to move forward
[32:21] you'll notice that God every time he
[32:24] gives a call he is never pushing his
[32:26] children backwards but God is moving his
[32:28] children forward he says the Lord our
[32:33] God speaking to us in Horeb saying ye
[32:36] have dwelt long enough in this mount
[32:37] turn you and take your journey and go to
[32:40] the Mount of the Emirati and unto the
[32:42] place not there and to in the plane and
[32:45] the heels and in the valve and in the
[32:47] south and by the seaside to the land of
[32:49] the canaanites under the Lebanon and
[32:52] under the great river the GU River
[32:53] Euphrates
[32:54] behold he's trying to grab your
[32:57] attention behold I have set the land
[33:01] before you can I say it to you like this
[33:05] I set the message before you I said all
[33:08] your inheritance before you I've set you
[33:11] what you need to get off the ground I've
[33:13] set it out before you everything that I
[33:16] take out of your cold and dead cold
[33:19] formal religions I've set it out before
[33:21] you but what do you got to do children
[33:24] of Israel go in and possess the land
[33:27] which the Lord swear unto your father's
[33:30] Abraham Isaac and Jacob to give unto
[33:33] them and to their seed after them he's
[33:36] heading here 40 years to think that they
[33:40] were there 40 years and you could drive
[33:43] that you could drive whether they were
[33:45] going to in less than half a day but 40
[33:50] years of complaining
[33:51] 40 years of murmuring calls him to
[33:54] circle this mountain but God finally
[33:57] came to them and said you're circled
[33:59] this melt ain't long enough turn
[34:01] northward don't look back don't look
[34:04] back to Egypt don't look back to the
[34:06] wilderness go forward can I say this to
[34:11] you don't go back to your Catholicism
[34:13] and your ideas of Pentecost don't go
[34:15] back to it fly higher people want to
[34:22] bring in they want to bring in
[34:24] charismatic worship why are we going
[34:26] back to the thing that we came out of
[34:29] people bringing in Pentecostal ideas
[34:32] that's just a watered-down gospel why
[34:34] are we going back to the Wallace
[34:37] come out of her my people I'm not going
[34:41] back I know what that produces it'll
[34:44] produce a life it will produce a life
[34:48] that is that is just a grasshopper but a
[34:53] grasshopper needs a full transformation
[34:55] Oh hallelujah if you want to fly with
[35:00] the Eagles you got to eat eagle food you
[35:03] got to praise like an eagle and Caleb
[35:09] and Joshua when they were come down to
[35:11] Kadesh Barnea when they come there to
[35:14] that spot they were looking for the
[35:16] Isles of promise they were looking for
[35:18] the eyes of an eagle where God had
[35:20] promised them that they were going to
[35:22] join in a in a strange land and that God
[35:25] was going to give them a laugh and when
[35:28] they went up there with 12 spies Moses
[35:30] setting off itself setting out one from
[35:33] each Rock how that he sent them all out
[35:35] and there was ten of them that came back
[35:37] and brought up a wrong report of the
[35:40] land but there was say there was a
[35:42] couple chickens there was ten chickens
[35:44] out there that was afraid of those
[35:46] giants out there you know what the
[35:49] problem was is they were looking from a
[35:52] chickens one of you and I'll tell you a
[35:54] chicken or run for cover every single
[35:56] time but there was two eagles that was
[35:59] sitting there that said we're more than
[36:01] able to take it the promises house God
[36:04] said it was eyes and we're good enough
[36:06] to take it they were not looking at it
[36:10] from the chickens point of view they
[36:13] were looking at it from the Eagles view
[36:15] the Eagles were flying over the Giants
[36:20] hallelujah they were anointed to fly
[36:23] above it
[36:27] hallelujah this eagle it's a very
[36:33] special bird it's very special it's
[36:37] eagle is built for soar and higher than
[36:41] any other bird this eagle is built to
[36:46] withstand the storms
[36:48] this Eagles feathers can handle it when
[36:51] other birds feathers can't handle it
[36:54] you see when that Eagle when he sees a
[36:58] storm coming all the other birds they
[37:01] begin to fly and look for cover and
[37:02] trying to hide out and they're there
[37:04] they're afraid of the storm but the
[37:05] Eagle is not afraid of the storm the
[37:08] eagle flies into the story the eagle
[37:11] flies higher from the end to the story
[37:13] you see when that eagle flies him to
[37:15] that storm he is getting up above he's
[37:19] getting up above that storm and he is
[37:21] testing out his wings you see when
[37:27] everybody else is running for cover and
[37:29] you run straight to the store it proves
[37:32] that you're an eagle when everybody else
[37:35] is afraid of cancer you run right to it
[37:37] and say you old slewfoot you ain't
[37:40] nothing but a devil you ain't scared of
[37:43] no cancer you fly above cancer when sin
[37:47] comes into the camp you don't run from
[37:49] sin you fly above sin
[37:51] it proves her an eagle you don't get
[37:56] underneath of it you get above it you
[38:00] were annoying it's a fly higher is that
[38:04] right you see a vulture brother branham
[38:07] said that a vultures anointed to fly -
[38:11] he's anointed to fly - but he cannot
[38:14] follow that eagle you see he can fly
[38:17] pretty high but he cannot see like the
[38:20] eagle can see a vulture cannot fall
[38:24] along with Hebrews 13 and eight that
[38:27] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[38:28] and forever he can't see that for a
[38:31] votes who can't fly and tell you that
[38:34] there is such thing as the Holy Ghost he
[38:36] can't see that far you see a voter just
[38:38] looks back to the day of Pentecost 2,000
[38:41] years ago but a eagle points to it it
[38:44] says you can have it it says it's for
[38:47] your children a vulture vulture he can
[38:54] dance with you
[38:57] a vulture can praise with you a vulture
[39:01] can shout with you but uh votes who
[39:03] don't know what is shouting about I vote
[39:06] you don't know why singing about I vote
[39:09] you don't know why is dancing and
[39:11] shouting and praising God about he can
[39:13] only see so far but that's for Eagles
[39:15] you can see what you're praising about
[39:20] [Applause]
[39:22] I'm anointed to fly higher than what the
[39:25] vultures can go you know it's said that
[39:30] an eagle can see up to two miles through
[39:33] a storm he can see up to two miles to
[39:37] miles
[39:38] several miles through the darkness he
[39:40] could see into the night and catch his
[39:42] prey he can see he can see when other
[39:46] birds can't fly there he's anointed to
[39:49] fly there he's built to fly there you
[39:54] see when you begin to watch an eagle
[39:56] when that storm comes he gets up above
[39:59] those storms and it begins to feel his
[40:01] wings and what's he's doing he's putting
[40:05] his faith in his wings he knows that
[40:08] there's chaos below him he knows that he
[40:11] knows that that if he can get above that
[40:13] if he can just stretch forth his
[40:15] nine-foot wings that he can put his
[40:19] faith in those wings and if you can ever
[40:21] put your faith in the Holy Ghost if you
[40:24] can ever play and set your faith in
[40:26] action and realize that God's Word is
[40:29] right you'll fly above all of these
[40:31] creeds and all of these ideologies a man
[40:34] that's bringing in an eagle is a very
[40:42] special special bird an eagle can live
[40:46] up to 70 years live up to 70 years but
[40:51] at their 40th year and Eagles got to go
[40:52] through a process just like you had to
[40:55] go through a process that Eagle has to
[40:58] be willing to accept the pain of change
[41:01] that Eagle has got to be willing because
[41:05] if he does not change he's going to die
[41:07] and if you don't change from your first
[41:10] birth you're going to die in your sin if
[41:13] you're not willing to go through the
[41:15] pain and go through the struggle of
[41:17] dying out and take it on his name in
[41:20] water baptism you die right there but an
[41:24] eagle if he's worth if he feels that
[41:27] it's worth the change that it's worth
[41:29] sustaining all the pain that he's gone
[41:31] through got to go through the eagle
[41:33] flies up to the highest mountain that he
[41:36] can set his eyes upon and he goes up
[41:39] there and he waits that eagle he gets to
[41:43] such a spot in his life that his talons
[41:46] no longer are strong enough to grab his
[41:49] prey he goes through a spot where his
[41:52] feathers begin to get so heavy that he
[41:55] can no longer fly in the height in which
[41:57] he was ordained to fly and his beak in
[42:00] which he eats with is no longer it's
[42:03] become door and it's no good but the
[42:07] Eagle knows that if he can go to that
[42:09] mountain and get up on that mountain and
[42:12] go through the process of change that he
[42:15] can live on he realizes he realizes that
[42:21] he's more than once am I talking to you
[42:23] tonight he realizes only got one chance
[42:26] to live this life out so he's willing to
[42:29] go through the hard spots of life he's
[42:33] willing to go through the family battles
[42:35] for this change he's willing to take on
[42:38] the reproach of Jesus name for this
[42:41] change Oh hallelujah he's willing to be
[42:46] called a heretic just for this change
[42:51] he's not a shame to go to the melton he
[42:55] was born for it but the Eagle gets on
[43:00] that mountain and he gets up there on a
[43:03] hard rock and he starts beating that old
[43:06] beak off of his nose he starts beating
[43:09] it and beating it and beating it and
[43:11] beating it until his old beak completely
[43:14] falls off
[43:17] you see he's got to have a beak that's
[43:21] able to eat her food and after his new
[43:26] beak goes back he starts pulling out his
[43:29] old talents that were no longer strong
[43:31] enough to grab his enemy and he pulls
[43:35] him plucks them out one at a time all
[43:39] the pain of each talent he pulls out
[43:42] he's going through this sustaining
[43:44] change for a renewal of an eco and after
[43:51] his talons go back he starts plucking
[43:54] out all of his old feathers one at a
[43:56] time you see in those old feathers with
[44:00] that old cloak you couldn't fly this
[44:02] high come on somebody I'm preaching to
[44:06] you tonight with that old feather you
[44:08] couldn't fly and see this message that's
[44:10] why you had to pull all those feathers
[44:12] out of your experience you had to pull
[44:16] drinking out of your spirit of your
[44:18] experience you had to pray you to pull
[44:20] out all of that carousing and smoking
[44:22] and running around looking at dirty
[44:24] things you got to pull those things out
[44:26] of your experience if you want to live I
[44:31] wonder if there's anybody in here that
[44:33] wants to live tonight he begins to pull
[44:39] out all of his old feathers and after he
[44:43] pulls out all of those feathers he now
[44:47] takes the flight of the Eagles rebirth
[44:50] and he has now renewed his strength the
[44:55] Bible says in Isaiah 40 they that wait
[44:58] upon the Lord shall renew their strength
[45:01] oh I'd say tonight Church of the Living
[45:05] God if you can wait on God and stop
[45:08] waiting on your staff on yourself and
[45:11] holding on to yourself it's not you
[45:14] holding on anyhow it's gotta be God
[45:16] holding on to you let go of your own
[45:19] experiences let go of your past
[45:22] let go of the pain now oh yeah he's got
[45:35] to be able to go through the change
[45:42] there's a lot of people they want to
[45:45] walk this there's a lot of people that
[45:50] want to live this but they have never
[45:53] accepted the pain to go through the
[45:57] change a birth is a mess a birth hurts a
[46:04] birth this plane for a birth is a mess
[46:08] and a lot of people don't want to die
[46:11] out they like holding on to that old man
[46:14] too much they like staying there in that
[46:16] condition where they can cuss and live
[46:19] anyway they won't through and come to
[46:21] church when it suits them they want to
[46:23] live in that condition but if you want
[46:26] to fly higher than a bunch of chickens
[46:28] you got to go through a change you got
[46:31] to go through a process I can baptize
[46:38] every single one of your family members
[46:40] back here but a lot of time we baptize
[46:43] them a dry sinner and we bring them up a
[46:45] Wes here but this house is full tonight
[46:49] of people that was willing to accept the
[46:52] change that was not willing to stay
[46:55] there a narrow stupor in that Oh
[46:57] condition but they wanted to fly above
[47:00] all of the chicken chaos mercy
[47:14] you know I I've been guilty in life and
[47:20] I I'm not ashamed to say it but I've
[47:22] been guilty for talking to chickens like
[47:25] they were Eagles I'll be honest with you
[47:33] I've been guilty of talking the chickens
[47:36] like they were egos but I want you to
[47:39] write this down I ain't never been wrong
[47:40] and I'll never be guilty of talking to
[47:43] an eagle like their chicken if you were
[47:48] born to fly that harm will tell you were
[47:50] born to fly that high if you were born
[47:54] to walk this Christian walk I'm gonna
[47:56] tell you you were born to walk a
[47:57] Christian walk I don't know who is and I
[48:00] don't know who ain't but I would never
[48:03] take away your god-given rights to fly
[48:05] this high to live this message to be
[48:08] this message we'd come here to talk
[48:11] about it we come to get into it if all
[48:15] we come here is to spit out some large
[48:18] and just preach a little bit so that
[48:20] we'll get your hand claps and your
[48:22] accolades we're doing nothing but I
[48:25] didn't come here to talk to you about a
[48:27] God at yesterday I come tonight to put
[48:30] on the table of eagles a god that's
[48:33] still the same yesterday today and
[48:35] forever let me be guilty of telling the
[48:39] truth
[48:44] I was talking this past week with my
[48:54] wife just going over these things that
[48:58] about what God is doing amongst us I'm
[49:04] not taking away from yesterday's revival
[49:06] we needed that revival to get us where
[49:08] we're at we're just talking about these
[49:12] things that God is doing for us how he
[49:14] has taken us at higher levels how he's
[49:17] taking this to a higher level of fries a
[49:19] higher level of singing you're witnesses
[49:23] the night here and out of our home that
[49:26] had telephone hookups you're a witness
[49:28] that you're singing from a different
[49:30] position you're worshiping at a new
[49:33] level a higher level we're talking about
[49:38] these things that God has taken us to a
[49:40] higher level of worship a higher level
[49:42] of praise I've never seen the word
[49:45] priest in such demonstrative power like
[49:48] we're watching it come forth in this
[49:50] hour when you're seeing God do a quick
[49:53] work in this hour when you see when
[49:55] you've seen all of the things he'll that
[49:57] how they used to how that you would feel
[49:59] your house is full of tapes and it would
[50:02] cost a family ten thousand dollars for a
[50:04] set of tapes but now you can buy that
[50:07] same exact yeah absolute condition in
[50:10] the same exact way on a little small SD
[50:13] card for twelve dollars
[50:15] it's the advancement young ministers are
[50:19] grabbing this message and running in
[50:21] with this message like never before when
[50:25] you used to see men of God that would
[50:26] come to a pulpit and they would have
[50:28] stacks of books and and and all the
[50:32] messages lined out and would have to
[50:34] pull that from this message that message
[50:36] and that message just to build their
[50:38] sermon but now it's in our fingertips
[50:42] God is taking us as the bride of Jesus
[50:45] Christ to a higher level he has not
[50:48] taken us past his word but he's taken us
[50:51] to a spot of rapture
[50:54] we were going over these things just
[50:58] talking about these things but this is
[51:00] what God has called us to and I'm happy
[51:04] to be living in the hour in which God
[51:07] has called us to this moment this is
[51:13] where eagles have gathered but you know
[51:17] a chicken came praise where you praise a
[51:21] chicken he can't go where you go
[51:24] a chicken can't dance like you dance and
[51:27] a chicken came worship like you worship
[51:30] a chicken can't soar like the eagle
[51:33] soars and shaken was born to be a
[51:37] chicken I take it you flap his wings and
[51:40] get up on a little static or I put a
[51:42] little pulse and and he can set up hair
[51:44] on his roost that's what he was born to
[51:46] do but that chicken could never fly will
[51:50] you fly it ain't got nothing to get
[51:53] chicken I hate a few of them every week
[52:00] but a chicken a chicken can't move where
[52:04] I move you know an eagle makes love in
[52:11] the air an eagle reproduces in the air
[52:17] you know when an eagle gets up there he
[52:19] know he ain't hooked up with some
[52:21] vulture I'm gonna talk to your knife
[52:28] you see a tegu can fly on another level
[52:31] he can fly so high that when he could go
[52:34] straight to the Sun that a film comes
[52:37] over his eyes and can flower I declare
[52:40] that Sun and he will not burst apart but
[52:42] a vulture trying to fire player he'll
[52:44] bust and he'll disintegrate in a moment
[52:48] young people I'm talking to you tonight
[52:50] if they came fly that high it proves to
[52:52] you that they ain't an eagle
[52:53] if they can't live his message it proves
[52:56] to you that they ain't and Eagle and
[52:59] Eagle can only dance that high and
[53:02] nobody else can dance there and Eagle
[53:07] can love on a totally different level
[53:09] than vultures and buzzards and chickens
[53:11] too and Eagle can stretch forth its
[53:15] wings like no other bird and he can fly
[53:17] but the stores fly above creats fly
[53:20] above darkness that Eagle can fly above
[53:24] people telling us that we got no right
[53:26] to worship let me just slow down here
[53:33] for a moment my pop Spencer used to
[53:41] preach a message it's hard to soar with
[53:45] Eagles when you're living with buzzards
[53:51] and if you're feasting on the dead
[53:54] carrion of the world
[53:56] you're not feasting on he goes man but I
[54:01] want you to know that I take what I do
[54:04] very seriously all of you know me quite
[54:08] well I'm a I'm a let me say it's right
[54:13] way I can be known to be a character I
[54:16] can do I can cut up and have a good time
[54:19] and I believe we should have a good time
[54:20] I believe that we as Christians ought to
[54:23] be able to enjoy our religion and enjoy
[54:25] our salvation but I take what I do very
[54:30] seriously I do it with all my heart and
[54:34] my soul and every energy that's within
[54:36] me I do
[54:37] with everything that's within me when I
[54:39] come out here as a song leader I don't
[54:42] just give half an effort when I'm caught
[54:45] on the singing especial I don't just
[54:46] sing it's just a song because of this
[54:48] song I want to sing a song that are
[54:50] taking me to a new level I want to sing
[54:53] a song that will create the same
[54:54] atmosphere that got my attention that
[54:56] it'll get your attention when I'm
[54:58] choosing songs have songs of worship I
[55:01] want to choose a song that'll so make
[55:03] you praise God that'll make you forget
[55:06] about what you just went through in your
[55:07] car before you got here I want to I want
[55:10] to sing such a song that you'll forget
[55:13] about what your boss said about you I
[55:15] want to sing and pray bring down the
[55:17] praises brain just begin to act out the
[55:20] praises of God so that when we begin to
[55:22] lift our voice and lift our hands and
[55:24] lift our worship as the praises of God
[55:27] go up the blessings of God begin to fall
[55:29] upon our lives I take what I do very
[55:32] seriously when I come to this pulpit to
[55:36] preach to you as a minister of the
[55:37] gospel of Jesus Christ I had know that I
[55:40] am responsible for every word that comes
[55:43] across my lips so I do it with
[55:45] everything that's within me and I say
[55:47] God not my will but thy will be done I
[55:50] don't want one word to come out of my
[55:52] mouth that'll hurt your children or
[55:54] afflict them or or instruct their walk
[55:57] with you I want to be right I take what
[56:01] I do very seriously and I believe that
[56:03] you should take very seriously what you
[56:05] do in your pew I believe that you ought
[56:09] to come into the house of God and you
[56:11] ought to get yourself ready
[56:12] I believe you ought to pray I believe
[56:17] you ought to sing when there's a song
[56:19] going forth I believe that when the song
[56:21] leaders say you ought to back him up
[56:23] whether you like the song whether you
[56:25] don't like the song get behind him God
[56:28] inspired him to sing that song maybe for
[56:31] one person what would it do if you begin
[56:35] to sing like you never sing before you
[56:39] might actually get born again
[56:43] I believe you ought to take it serious
[56:45] if you're one of these instruments that
[56:47] play one of these instruments up here
[56:49] you ought to do it with everything
[56:50] that's within you
[56:51] I'm gonna call names sister Deborah
[56:54] ought to do with everything that's
[56:55] within sister Cassie ought to do it with
[56:58] everything that's within brother Jeffery
[57:01] brother Donnie sister Emma sister Sarah
[57:03] bad brother matters all of these ought
[57:05] to do it with everything that's within
[57:07] them if God is taking us to a higher
[57:10] level of praise let our musicians be
[57:13] ready to praise Him and then let all the
[57:17] congregation sing in with one unity sing
[57:20] the song of sign sing the praises of God
[57:23] if God is taking us to a higher level of
[57:28] preaching I worship on a match the word
[57:32] I take what I do very seriously and when
[57:42] I hear my critics tell me that I should
[57:47] no longer worship God you know I I'm a
[57:52] Bible believer and I believe that
[57:55] everything that I preach ought to come
[57:56] out of this Bible and if it ain't coming
[57:58] out of this Bible then I shouldn't be
[58:00] preaching it that's why I preach this
[58:02] message to you because I can line it up
[58:04] with a Bible
[58:06] but when my critics are telling me that
[58:09] I had that I should no longer worship
[58:11] God and I should no longer praise God I
[58:13] do when I was taught to do I take it
[58:18] back to the Bible and you know I find
[58:20] that it didn't take me very long to find
[58:22] out that God likes worship and God likes
[58:25] to praise for the Bible says in Psalms
[58:27] 150 praise ye the Lord
[58:29] praise God in His sanctuary praise Him
[58:32] in the firmament of his power praising
[58:34] him for his mighty acts praise him
[58:36] according to his excellent greatness
[58:37] praise him with the sound of a trumpet
[58:40] praise and with a sultry and a heart I
[58:42] didn't forget you sister April you were
[58:44] just hiding back here praise him with
[58:46] that saxophone praise him with the
[58:48] timbrel praise him with a dance praise
[58:51] him with string instruments and on
[58:52] oregon's praise him on the loud sound
[58:55] cymbals praise him on the high sounding
[58:57] cymbals let everything exclude and
[58:59] everyone in this building unless you're
[59:01] dead tonight let everything that hath
[59:04] breath praise he the Lord
[59:19] oh yeah oh yeah I was anointed to do it
[59:33] someone do it take that critics I take
[59:47] what I do very seriously when I come and
[59:50] stand behind this pulpit when people
[59:53] tell me then I should stop preaching and
[59:56] they tell me how to put a tape player
[59:58] right up here
[59:59] and I said let that tape player preach
[1:00:02] to you instead of me standing up here
[1:00:04] and giving you chewed up food I take it
[1:00:10] very seriously so what I do I go back to
[1:00:12] the Bible and I find out what the Bible
[1:00:14] says and the Bible says that house said
[1:00:17] they hear without a preacher I found
[1:00:19] what the Bible said so I'm going to stay
[1:00:21] with the Bible the Bible tells me to
[1:00:23] police summer preach
[1:00:24] I was anointed to fly higher than what
[1:00:32] they have said brother did he they told
[1:00:36] me I shouldn't worship and I'm flying
[1:00:37] higher than what they said they told me
[1:00:40] I shouldn't preach nother nathanael but
[1:00:42] I'm flying higher than what they said
[1:00:44] I've also heard the same critics tell me
[1:00:47] that we ought to stop all that emotion
[1:00:49] you know what I did I went back to the
[1:00:52] prophets message and the prophets
[1:00:53] message said that anything with Alamelu
[1:00:56] emotion is dead and you need the barrier
[1:01:09] I'll take what the Prophet said over
[1:01:12] your criticism can I say it like a
[1:01:19] prophet said it here and I'll take
[1:01:21] Church of the Living God do you know
[1:01:23] where you staying
[1:01:24] you are predestinated to do it and if
[1:01:28] the bridegroom could do it what about

[1:01:35] little bit higher don't stay down there

[1:02:18] critics and whether you know it's
[1:02:21] tonight they're not just my critics
[1:02:23] brother Ron's critics brother Tim's
[1:02:25] critics they're your critics they tell
[1:02:29] us that we ought to stop preaching now
[1:02:30] we ought to stop worshipping God and we
[1:02:32] ought to move on past emotion and it's
[1:02:34] time to get back to the word well let me
[1:02:37] put you on notice tonight if you haven't
[1:02:40] noticed that's why I am preaching that's
[1:02:43] why I am singing that's why I am dancing
[1:02:45] that's why I am selling that's why I am
[1:02:48] praising God that's why I am worshipping
[1:02:50] that's like I'm doing that's why I'm
[1:02:52] doing what I'm doing is because I came
[1:02:54] back to the world and if you don't like
[1:02:57] that watch this you didn't like my
[1:03:03] preaching 10 years ago well if God

[1:16:17] condition he walked away on another
[1:16:19] level
