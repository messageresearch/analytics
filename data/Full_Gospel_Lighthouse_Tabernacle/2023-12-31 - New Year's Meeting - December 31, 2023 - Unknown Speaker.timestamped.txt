[37:18] that he would do and we've seen that
[37:20] come right here and manifest itself
[37:22] right into our midst and to that we're
[37:25] thankful and uh I know that you're aware
[37:27] but I i' ask that you would be praying
[37:29] for us this week myself and sister Katie
[37:31] will be headed to Belgium uh to speak
[37:34] the the Belgium Youth Camp there along
[37:38] with brother Matthew Watkins and and
[37:40] brother uh Paul halit and uh I know uh
[37:44] this is my first overseas trip and uh
[37:47] you know I always said I did my
[37:49] missionary work down there in Louisiana
[37:51] cuz that was another part of the world
[37:52] and so I guess I can't say that no more
[37:55] but I certainly would appre appreciate
[37:56] your prayers and uh not that I'm nervous
[37:59] or anything but I I am nervous uh but uh
[38:03] you know I
[38:05] I you know I I thought about it I
[38:08] probably the biggest thing that probably
[38:10] made me nervous nervous about it is is
[38:12] working with a translator you know and
[38:14] just you know my style and my rhythm and
[38:17] everything but you know me living and
[38:19] being best friends with brother out and

[38:22] for all the translation work you know so
[38:25] dealing with a bunch of these frasers
[38:27] around here I have to translate for them
[38:28] you know sometimes so so now now the
[38:33] Belgian people have to try to translate
[38:35] me so but uh just so you know we're not
[38:39] leaving brother Matthew out this this
[38:41] weekend brother Matthew is going to
[38:42] bring his new year's message uh for you
[38:44] next Saturday next Saturday night and
[38:47] and uh we had to give him a little bit
[38:49] more room you know us Brothers have 30
[38:51] minutes but brother Matthew just needs a
[38:53] little bit more Running Room so so

[42:20] Heavenly Father we approach you Lord
[42:22] from the depths of our soul we want to
[42:25] express our gratitude ude for the things
[42:27] that we have seen Lord David would say
[42:30] it that this is the doing of the Lord
[42:33] and it is marvelous in our sights Lord
[42:36] my mind has been reflecting upon the
[42:39] thoughts and the sermons that have went
[42:41] on this past year so many glorious
[42:43] things that that were held there in the
[42:46] library of God's economy that you begin
[42:49] to release to us this past year father
[42:52] I'd say that we are better people this
[42:55] year than we were in 2022 but Lord as we
[42:58] get ready to transition into 2024 father
[43:02] with every fiber of our being Lord we
[43:04] want to offer ourselves up as a Living
[43:07] Sacrifice we want to surrender our mind
[43:09] our heart our our beings our work our
[43:12] monies our families Lord every part of
[43:15] ourselves we want to offer it to you
[43:17] Lord that we would be better in 20124
[43:20] Father not to outdo each other not to
[43:23] have a competition to be better but Lord
[43:25] just to be something that you would find
[43:28] willing to come and snatch us away Lord
[43:31] a people that are ready a people that
[43:33] are dressed father our desire is to
[43:36] please you and to please you only and
[43:38] God I ask today as the preaching of the
[43:41] word would go forth these special
[43:43] meetings that'll happen here today I
[43:45] pray that you would come amongst it Lord
[43:48] I'm just reminded Lord just now while
[43:50] I'm praying that last year at this time
[43:53] we had these special meetings and it was
[43:55] it was the very first time that some of
[43:57] our sisters begin to speak in tongues
[44:00] Lord what can you do in a service father
[44:02] so many times we look at it in in a time
[44:05] element of of a day or in certain hours
[44:08] but Lord in your mind you're releasing
[44:10] things through the body father I pray
[44:12] that you would begin to just talk to us
[44:15] from your word today draw us up to us
[44:18] Lord like you did the little children
[44:20] because you love them and I know that
[44:22] today that you've gathered your children
[44:24] here we love you father we want to hear
[44:26] your voice anything you say Will Be
[44:29] Heaven to us so God we counted a
[44:31] privilege to hear your word we bless
[44:34] your Holy Name today and the Bride of
[44:36] Jesus Christ says amen amen if you have
[44:39] your Bibles today we'd like to look over
[44:42] in Daniel chap 3 and verse 16 and also
[44:46] Philippians chap 1 and verse
[44:52] 6 Daniel chapter 3 and verse 16
[45:10] after I get done uh with my portion
[45:13] today brother Shan and sister Tracy and
[45:15] sister Heather you can just plan to make
[45:16] your way there to sing your special
[45:19] today after we finish here Daniel 3 and:
[45:22] 16 Shadrach meach and abedo answered and
[45:26] said to the king oh Nebuchadnezzar we
[45:29] are not careful to answer thee in this
[45:32] matter if it be so our God whom we serve
[45:36] is able to Deliver Us From The Burning
[45:39] fiery furnace and he will deliver us out
[45:42] of thine hand O King but if not be it
[45:45] known unto thee Oh King that we will not
[45:48] serve thy Gods nor worship the golden
[45:51] image which thou has set up also
[45:54] Philippians chapter 1 1 and verse
[46:05] 6 being confident of this very thing
[46:10] that he which hath begun a good work in
[46:13] you will perform it until the day of
[46:18] Jesus Christ amen may God bless his word
[46:21] you may be seated today in the presence
[46:23] of the Lord I believe that sometimes and
[46:26] often times in the in our human mind in
[46:29] our in our in our human finite Minds
[46:32] that we often times when we begin to
[46:34] read the scripture that we see it and we
[46:37] get a perception about the the Bible
[46:39] characters that they were superhuman or
[46:42] they had a super anointing but that's
[46:44] very much contrary if you begin to study
[46:46] out the Bible the Bible would tell us
[46:48] that they were men of like passions like
[46:50] ourselves and they they were men made
[46:52] out of the same elements that we are
[46:54] made out of and so many times we look at
[46:56] characters in The Bible and sometimes we
[46:59] think of it almost as Fiction it's
[47:01] almost too hard to believe that men
[47:03] could do that but they were under the
[47:04] anointing of the hour that they were
[47:07] living in and you know many times you
[47:09] read the Bible and you get that
[47:11] perception but really to know that they
[47:13] were brothers just like you and maybe
[47:15] maybe if it was your time to actually
[47:17] live that would be your name instead of
[47:19] Noah's name but many times we begin to
[47:21] think well I could never play that part
[47:23] or I could never do that but but you
[47:26] realize that that men God would use men
[47:28] just like you men that had problems men
[47:30] that had mistakes and the Bible tells us
[47:33] if you read it that Noah got drunk that
[47:35] Abraham was way too old and Isaac was
[47:38] simply a Daydreamer Jacob was a liar
[47:41] Leah was ugly Joseph was abused so no
[47:43] matter what situation that you're in in
[47:46] life God can use your character to play
[47:48] the part that he has Moses was a
[47:51] murderer and they couldn't halfway talk
[47:53] Gideon was afraid and Rahab was a
[47:55] prostitute that should have never been
[47:57] in the picture Jeremiah and Timothy was
[48:00] way too young David was a murderer and
[48:02] an adulator Elijah if you go to study
[48:05] Elijah's Ministry Elijah was actually
[48:07] suicidal at one point in his ministry
[48:10] Isaiah preached naked John Jonah ran
[48:13] away from God Naomi was a widow job had
[48:17] went bankrupt in his business John the
[48:19] Baptist sat around and ate on bucks
[48:21] Peter denied the Lord the disciples fell
[48:24] asleep while while praying Martha
[48:26] worried about everything Mary Magdalene
[48:29] was demon-possessed and the Samaritan
[48:31] woman was divorced more than once zakus
[48:35] was way too short and Paul was a
[48:37] murderer and Lazarus was past dead so no
[48:40] matter what situation that you're in
[48:42] you're a whole lot better off than what
[48:44] Lazarus was this morning to think that
[48:47] God can use the the human abilities of
[48:50] of man and use them in in a way to bring
[48:53] about a story a story of Grace that
[48:55] could depict a part of his mercy and
[48:58] today I'd like to speak to you for a few
[49:00] minutes on the opportunities that we've
[49:02] been given the opportunities that we've
[49:04] been given I believe that everything in
[49:06] life is an opportunity it depends on
[49:09] what you're going to do if that
[49:10] opportunity is what will be the outcome
[49:12] of your story you see the difference in
[49:15] a lot of these characters that we've
[49:17] just read here is they were not
[49:19] qualified in the beginning but God does
[49:21] not call the qualified he qualifies the
[49:24] called and God always takes men that
[49:27] seem like they are nobodies and he makes
[49:30] them into something into the kingdom of
[49:32] God and no matter what arises in life
[49:34] God is going to wait around and see how
[49:37] that you react to the word of God how do
[49:39] you handle the chaos or how do you
[49:41] handle the crisis when you look at
[49:43] shamar's life he could have went on and
[49:45] allowed the Philistines to continue to
[49:48] to go through the process of robbing him
[49:50] right at the Harvest Time year after
[49:53] year he could allow that to go on but
[49:55] but shamgar had to come to his shamgar
[49:58] moment he had to come to a spot where
[50:00] Revelation would set in that I'm not
[50:03] just an ordinary man but I am a man that
[50:05] is under the abrahamic Covenant that I
[50:08] have been circumcised and I have a
[50:10] covenant with me that the god of Abraham
[50:12] is with me and shamgar had one of those
[50:15] moments like he took his head out of the
[50:17] sand and he finally realized that this
[50:19] is what I was born for I was not born
[50:22] for the Philistines to come in and rob
[50:24] me at the greatest time of my life and
[50:26] that's what you've been raised up for is
[50:28] not to keep your head in the sand but to
[50:31] stand there and pull your head out of
[50:32] the sand and say I was born for this to
[50:35] take everything that that Le O is trying
[50:37] to rob from me and take the very best
[50:39] things of life out of my Harvest you see
[50:42] so many times Satan comes in and he robs
[50:45] us right at the best of times but isn't
[50:47] that exactly how worry comes in worry
[50:50] comes in is exactly when you got
[50:52] everything in place you got everything
[50:55] in place and you start worrying what if
[50:57] I lose it all I see it as an opportunity
[51:00] just to get greater in the economy of
[51:02] almighty God you see you can either see
[51:05] it or this is just the way that I've got
[51:06] to live or you're going to have to see
[51:08] it as or you can see it as this is an
[51:11] opportunity for me to give God
[51:13] glory but I believe that too many times
[51:16] that people live in the clutches of the
[51:19] fear of
[51:21] failure they live in the clutches of
[51:23] fear of failure of of a afraid that
[51:25] they're going to let somebody down or
[51:27] they're they're afraid to maybe stand up
[51:29] in front of somebody and to stand up for
[51:32] their god-given rights or stand up for
[51:34] their convictions because they are
[51:35] afraid that they might fail they might
[51:37] not have the scripture in place or maybe
[51:39] they have that fear of failing or being
[51:42] an
[51:43] embarrassment you see that's what fear
[51:45] of failure is it is it is somebody that
[51:48] is that it causes that that fear it
[51:50] causes people to avoid the activity or a
[51:53] scenario that that that has potential to
[51:56] have an unsuccessful outcome upon it and
[52:00] someone with that condition might be
[52:01] scared to try new things they might be
[52:03] able they might be scared to take risk
[52:05] they might be scared to go out and talk
[52:07] to somebody a lot of times people have
[52:10] fear of failure they don't go out and
[52:12] talk to they don't talk to this one when
[52:14] they really want to say something but
[52:16] they're afraid of what actually might
[52:17] come of it so they don't say anything
[52:19] boys are afraid to talk to girls because
[52:21] they're afraid that they might let them
[52:23] down people in business are afraid to
[52:26] make the business call because they're
[52:28] afraid that the customer won't go
[52:29] through and instead of inh and instead
[52:32] of handling rejection they simply just
[52:34] don't go forward in it but fear is is
[52:38] such a powerful thing that that the
[52:40] Bible would tell us in three in over 600
[52:43] times in the Bible do not be afraid fear
[52:45] not fear not don't be afraid it's over
[52:48] in the Bible over 600 times that it
[52:51] spoke to us so we realize that there is
[52:54] a Godly fear and there is a fear that
[52:56] comes from Satan What Fear does Fear
[52:59] will actually protect you in a way but
[53:01] fear can also drive you away from the
[53:04] things that are really meant for your
[53:05] life you see that phrase do not fear was
[53:08] spoke to Abraham when he was too old
[53:11] that phrase it was spoke to Israel when
[53:14] she was getting ready to cross the Red
[53:16] Sea don't be afraid it was spoke to
[53:18] Moses that word that phrase was spoke to
[53:20] David that ran away from Saul it was
[53:23] spoke that to Daniel don't you be afraid
[53:25] in the Lion's Den it was spoke to the
[53:28] disciples on the angry sea fear not it
[53:30] is I that walketh on the water it was
[53:32] spoke to Paul when he was on a ship for
[53:35] 14 days do not be afraid these
[53:38] characters had a Godly fear about them a
[53:41] fear without failure so there is a Godly
[53:44] fear that will drive you Hallelujah to
[53:47] the opportunities that will not let you
[53:50] down there is a fear of failure that
[53:52] you're always going to fail somebody or
[53:54] you're not going to accomplish what you
[53:56] set out to do but I believe that we can
[53:58] have a fear without failure I believe
[54:01] that we can look at every opportunity as
[54:04] the opportunity as the Church of the
[54:05] Living God and see it as a day that we
[54:07] can rise and possess what is rightfully
[54:10] ours 10 spies may rise up and say we're
[54:13] not able to do it but there's going to
[54:15] be somebody that's got faith to say
[54:17] that's my land and I'm more than able to
[54:19] go in there and Conquer
[54:21] it you don't have to fear because fear
[54:25] fear has met its maker when it met
[54:29] Jesus brother brand said in the message
[54:31] I know he said Satan could not take them
[54:34] he could not drown Noah in the flood
[54:36] until the purpose purpose of God had
[54:38] been finished he could not burn up the
[54:39] Hebrew children until the purpose of God
[54:42] had been finished he could not kill job
[54:44] with boils and troubles until the
[54:46] purpose of God had been finished neither
[54:49] could the lions eat Daniel until the
[54:50] purpose of God had been finished neither
[54:53] could death in old age take Abraham him
[54:55] until the purpose of God had been
[54:57] finished and neither can it take you or
[55:00] can it take me until the purpose of God
[55:02] of our life is finished so we gather
[55:05] from this conclusion from right here
[55:08] that why does God let troubles come God
[55:11] harnesses troubles and he puts bits in
[55:13] its mouth and makes it obey him and
[55:16] those troubles bring us into a closer
[55:20] fellowship with God you can either look
[55:22] at your trouble as as as as Toro or you
[55:25] can look at it as an
[55:28] opportunity you see because William
[55:30] Brandon would tell us he would preach to
[55:32] us the greatest battle ever fought and
[55:35] we know where that battle is it's right
[55:37] there in the mind and that is where you
[55:39] got to win the war before you win it in
[55:41] the flesh you've got to win it in your
[55:43] mind before you ever overcome out there
[55:46] in the natural you've got to win it
[55:48] right here in your mind before you can
[55:50] go out there and possess your
[55:51] inheritance you've got to win that
[55:53] battle right here in your your mind and
[55:56] my favorite one of my favorite
[55:57] scriptures is Isaiah 26 and3 that I will
[56:00] keep him in perfect peace whose mind is
[56:04] stayed on me the only way you're going
[56:07] to win a war is not to be tore up and
[56:10] not to be a distress is to be in perfect
[56:14] peace you see what adversity does
[56:17] adversity proves what's on the inside of
[56:21] you come on somebody we'd have never
[56:24] known what Noah was made of unless he
[56:26] was asked to build an ark we' have never
[56:28] known what Moses was made of unless God
[56:31] made him go out there on the backside of
[56:32] a desert we' have never known what
[56:35] Malachi was made of unless God would
[56:37] send him through trials right here in
[56:39] the midst of Le oosa we didn't never
[56:42] known what brother Chris was made of
[56:43] unless God would send him through
[56:46] something adversity proves what you got
[56:50] on the inside of you and David said yay
[56:52] though I walk through the valley of The
[56:54] Shadow of death I will fear no evil let
[56:58] me tell you something a shadow cannot
[56:59] hurt
[57:00] you a shadow cannot hurt you a shadow of
[57:04] a of a lion cannot hurt you a shadow of
[57:07] a sword cannot hurt you a shadow of a
[57:09] gun cannot hurt you it's just a shadow
[57:12] and you might feel like you've been
[57:14] living in the shadows but the Shadows
[57:16] cannot hurt you yay though I walk
[57:19] through the valley of the shadow of
[57:21] death death is simply a shadow under the
[57:24] formidable hands of almighty God he
[57:27] destroyed
[57:28] death come on somebody a lion Shadow
[57:31] can't hurt you but when you get the
[57:33] reality of it that's where it hurts you
[57:36] a shadow will never hurt you and Satan
[57:39] might have put you in a shadow and make
[57:41] you feel like you're living depressed
[57:43] but it's time to impress your depression
[57:45] and show your depression that almighty
[57:48] God has showed
[57:51] up Hallelujah David said the Lord Lord
[57:55] is my light and my salvation Whom Shall
[57:58] I Fear the Lord is the strength of my
[58:01] life of whom shall I be afraid a
[58:04] thousand shall fall at thy side and
[58:06] 10,000 at thy right hand but it shall
[58:08] not come n thee spiritual strength is
[58:12] greater than physical strength I'd
[58:14] rather have the strength of this little
[58:17] boy right here than what Samson had on
[58:19] the inside of him I'd rather have the
[58:22] strength of sister Sharon breed and than
[58:25] to have the strength and all the wisdom
[58:27] of Solomon it's because it's not an
[58:29] anointing it's a holy ghost
[58:33] [Applause]
[58:35] seal Hallelujah the Bible said in
[58:38] Hebrews 13:6 the Lord is my helper and I
[58:42] will not fear what man shall do unto me
[58:45] David or or Paul would say what shall we
[58:48] say to these things if God before us who
[58:52] can be against
[58:53] us
[58:55] amen
[58:57] hallelujah when you go to studying out
[59:00] just want to transition just for a
[59:01] moment when you go to studying out first
[59:03] Kings chapter 19 you study out the the
[59:07] effects or the stages of Elijah's
[59:10] Ministry and you look at it where Elijah
[59:13] is scared of a
[59:16] woman scared of his woman he's scared of
[59:18] a woman he's scared he's scared to such
[59:21] a place that he's all by himself he
[59:22] thinks he's all by himself that he
[59:24] actually ask God let me let me die take
[59:28] my life from me so he goes to a Jour a
[59:31] juniper tree God causes a sleep to come
[59:33] upon him and then he feeds him he feeds
[59:37] him such a snack that he's able to sleep
[59:40] for 40 days so never underestimate the
[59:42] power of a snack and a
[59:45] nap he goes from there goes up and hides
[59:49] in a cave goes up there hides in a
[59:52] cave he's hiding up there and he feels
[59:55] the effects of the wind and he feels the
[59:57] effects of the earthquake he feels the
[59:59] effects of it but that was not him what
[1:00:02] we seen in or Roberts and Billy Graham
[1:00:04] that was the effects that was the
[1:00:07] effects but that was not him but Elijah
[1:00:10] was waiting on the manifestation of the
[1:00:13] reality and then he asked him what are
[1:00:15] you doing up here Elijah what are you
[1:00:17] doing up here your ministry your
[1:00:20] ministry is not called decave
[1:00:23] Ministry come on now I'm talking to you
[1:00:26] your ministry is not to stay in the cave
[1:00:29] of Le oosa and say I can't do it it's an
[1:00:32] opportunity for you to show what you
[1:00:34] built What You're Made Of You are not
[1:00:37] built to stay in the cave you heard the
[1:00:39] voice so come out of the
[1:00:42] cave come out of depression come out of
[1:00:45] anxiety come out of
[1:00:49] pain come out of
[1:00:53] it earnest siming way is one of the
[1:00:55] greatest one of the greatest men that
[1:00:58] had the ability to take words and make
[1:01:01] novels with him he he was one of the
[1:01:03] most profound most profound shortstory
[1:01:06] man that there was and then he was known
[1:01:10] for his lengthy Power of Words and he
[1:01:12] could put he could tie words together
[1:01:14] and he was sitting down one day at
[1:01:16] breakfast with a bunch of with a bunch
[1:01:18] of authors that had sit around with him
[1:01:20] and they bet him said now Ernest I bet
[1:01:23] you that you you can't make a you can't
[1:01:25] make a six-word short story he picked up
[1:01:29] a napkin he picked up a napkin and he
[1:01:32] wrote down six
[1:01:34] words for sale baby shoes never
[1:01:38] worn he took those words and made a
[1:01:42] story out of it and you might think that
[1:01:45] you're living such a life that God can
[1:01:47] never make anything out of your life but
[1:01:49] I want you to know whether you be little
[1:01:51] or whether you be great God can take the
[1:01:54] story of your life and make something
[1:01:57] great out of it you might look at your
[1:01:59] life as just just ordinary you might
[1:02:02] look as your life is just normal but I
[1:02:04] want to say this to you that anybody
[1:02:07] that has the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:02:09] is completely unnormal you are not
[1:02:12] ordinary you are not built here to be
[1:02:15] like the rest of the world come on
[1:02:17] sisters I know it might be hard for you
[1:02:20] young girls to go out there and be in
[1:02:22] the face of all of your peers and your
[1:02:24] friends in the midst of school and stand
[1:02:26] out there and stand up for the for the
[1:02:28] righteousness of Holiness but it's an
[1:02:31] opportunity to show that God is still
[1:02:34] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:02:37] that it's an
[1:02:38] [Applause]
[1:02:41] opportunity and Elijah goes from a cave
[1:02:44] because notice shortly after this the
[1:02:47] rapture's
[1:02:48] coming shortly after this moment but he
[1:02:51] goes up there he goes up there on the
[1:02:54] back side after his cave moment and one
[1:02:57] of the greatest opportunities comes out
[1:03:00] of his cave moment he goes up there and
[1:03:03] he sees a man that is a man of wealth
[1:03:05] that we know by the name of Elisha he's
[1:03:08] out there working in the field plowing
[1:03:11] with 12
[1:03:12] oxen he's got some of the best equipment
[1:03:15] that there ever is and L is on the 12th
[1:03:18] one now you can look at it you can study
[1:03:21] all the scriptures you can study all the
[1:03:23] commentators some of them say that it
[1:03:25] was 12 men out there and some of them
[1:03:27] say that it was Elijah Elisha working
[1:03:29] with 12 oxen so let's take it from the
[1:03:32] aspect that there was 11 other men out
[1:03:34] there Elijah walk past 11 other ones and
[1:03:37] he chose this one because he saw
[1:03:40] something on the inside of Elisha
[1:03:42] because Elisha brother brandom said what
[1:03:44] caught Elijah's mind about Elisha was he
[1:03:47] had the ability to keep a straight line
[1:03:50] he was not going to waver to the left
[1:03:52] side or to the right side he was going
[1:03:54] to stay right there in the middle of his
[1:03:56] road and when he did when he come past
[1:03:59] Elisha he allowed his manle to be draped
[1:04:03] over top of Elisha now let me tell you
[1:04:06] something if you stay in your cave
[1:04:08] you'll never have an Elisha
[1:04:10] moment if you stay where you think you
[1:04:13] ought to stay where you're safe at
[1:04:15] you're never going to meet your elasa
[1:04:17] the one that's going to be a Protegé
[1:04:19] that'll carry on the
[1:04:21] message if William Brandon would have
[1:04:23] got his wish and standing at the Gap
[1:04:25] being a better Trapper you'd have never
[1:04:27] been here but because there's a God
[1:04:30] that's rich in Mercy that saw the
[1:04:34] opportunities he laid the mantle over on
[1:04:37] top of
[1:04:39] him notice when he lays it over on top
[1:04:41] of him Elijah kept
[1:04:44] walking but when he turned around Elisha
[1:04:47] wasn't standing where he was where he
[1:04:49] found him at Elisha was following him
[1:04:53] because if you're ever going to be
[1:04:54] successful in life you are only going to
[1:04:56] be as successful as the people that you
[1:04:59] follow and if you are following if
[1:05:02] you're following Putin and if you're
[1:05:03] following Pope and if you're following
[1:05:05] Joe Biden you are going to go down in
[1:05:08] mystery but if you can follow almighty
[1:05:11] God you are going to have a successful
[1:05:16] life and Alisha was following the
[1:05:20] prophet what did he see on the inside of
[1:05:24] Elijah it was an anointing that
[1:05:26] attracted himself to
[1:05:31] it brother R said now I don't understand
[1:05:34] this he said because if you look over in
[1:05:37] the scriptures when over in the New
[1:05:39] Testament he said the man asked can I go
[1:05:41] back and bid my mother and my father
[1:05:43] goodbye and Jesus wouldn't let him he
[1:05:46] said but he allowed Elisha to because
[1:05:48] Elisha said let me go back let me return
[1:05:52] back and kiss my my mother and my father
[1:05:55] and Elijah said what have I done unto
[1:05:57] thee but notice what Elisha does when he
[1:06:02] turns back from the
[1:06:04] prophet he turns back and what does he
[1:06:07] do he goes back there and he takes what
[1:06:10] he's been working with this is the
[1:06:12] finest of qualities of oxen this is the
[1:06:15] finest of qualities of instruments that
[1:06:18] Elisha's been working with he's a mighty
[1:06:20] man of wealth he's got great things but
[1:06:23] what does Elisha should do he takes his
[1:06:25] plow he takes his instruments and he
[1:06:28] burns them and he takes the oxen and he
[1:06:31] places it upon the sacrifice what was he
[1:06:33] doing he was waving back to his past and
[1:06:37] kissing his past goodbye said so long
[1:06:40] I'm not going back to my past no longer
[1:06:43] he thought so much about Elijah's
[1:06:45] Ministry that he kissed his past goodbye
[1:06:48] said no more no more of this no more
[1:06:52] drugs no more pain no more
[1:06:56] alcohol it's time that you take the
[1:06:59] opportunity to kiss your past
[1:07:03] goodbye so long so
[1:07:07] long Hallelujah burn the sacrifice
[1:07:11] there's nothing to go back
[1:07:14] to you got a job to do you've got an
[1:07:18] opportunity to do to carry the
[1:07:20] [Applause]
[1:07:22] message if a El would have turned back
[1:07:25] and went back he would have SED it would
[1:07:28] have SED that he didn't have something
[1:07:29] on the inside of him but Elijah saw
[1:07:32] something on in the inside of
[1:07:35] Elisha Elisha you may not understand the
[1:07:37] opportunity that is coming by your way
[1:07:39] but you're getting get getting ready to
[1:07:41] be have a bigger Ministry than Elijah
[1:07:45] himself you're getting ready to have a
[1:07:47] double portion if I can tell you to get
[1:07:51] out of your of your place that you're in
[1:07:53] right now leave where you're at stop
[1:07:57] living where you've been and start
[1:07:59] moving to what God wants you to
[1:08:02] be come on somebody you've got to stop
[1:08:04] looking back through your past lay aside
[1:08:07] every weight and sin that does so easily
[1:08:09] beset us let us run this race with
[1:08:12] patience that you so set before
[1:08:14] [Music]
[1:08:18] us a double portion let me tell you if
[1:08:21] you stay where the Baptist got you you
[1:08:23] will never have a d double portion if
[1:08:25] you stay where the Methodist found you
[1:08:27] you'll never have a double portion if
[1:08:28] you stay with the Catholic Church you'll
[1:08:30] never have a double portion but if you
[1:08:32] can burn it if you can burn where you've
[1:08:35] been burn your Traditions burn your
[1:08:38] ideas burn what you think the message is
[1:08:41] and come to the reality there's a double
[1:08:44] portion waiting on the other side of
[1:08:46] this
[1:08:52] opportunity
[1:08:57] but if you go if you go study a blessing
[1:09:02] Prophet we're all capable of missing
[1:09:07] opportunities I'd say we in 2023 I'd say
[1:09:11] that some of us messed up
[1:09:13] here I'd say we messed up but we learned
[1:09:16] from our mistakes I'd say we had some
[1:09:18] faults that that maybe led us down in
[1:09:21] our own Humanity but there was something
[1:09:23] that didn't allow you to stay where you
[1:09:25] were but it Rose you to another
[1:09:27] challenge it Rose you to another
[1:09:30] Plateau don't say where you are William
[1:09:33] Brandon said this I'm
[1:09:36] guilty here's the prophet of this day
[1:09:40] the guy that God is going to use to
[1:09:43] bring and release all of the Mysteries
[1:09:45] to this
[1:09:46] body I'm guilty I'm guilty for not doing
[1:09:50] the job of God like I should I'm
[1:09:53] confessing it that I'm wrong I'm asking
[1:09:56] God to be merciful to me I look out
[1:09:57] there and I see opportunities that I
[1:10:00] miss because of petty things little old
[1:10:02] insignificant things that didn't mean
[1:10:04] nothing he said I'm ashamed of myself as
[1:10:07] a gospel Ministry before you I Repent
[1:10:10] before God and ask God to forgive me and
[1:10:13] the church to forgive me for being so
[1:10:15] dilatory about the work of God he said
[1:10:18] they said I've won a million souls to
[1:10:20] Christ he said that's as far as I got he
[1:10:23] said I should have done one 10 million
[1:10:25] souls for Christ he said I look out
[1:10:28] there and I see all those missed
[1:10:32] opportunities he said but what about you
[1:10:34] have you won one soul to
[1:10:37] Christ come on somebody have you won so
[1:10:40] one soul to Christ if you haven't you're
[1:10:45] guilty every one of us got to be put on
[1:10:48] this altar how many times has you
[1:10:50] testified that God is a God that heals
[1:10:53] cancer how many times has you told
[1:10:55] somebody that he's a God that saves he's
[1:10:57] a God that delivers he's a God that sets
[1:11:00] free if you've not released your
[1:11:03] testimony you're
[1:11:10] guilty man praise the Lord but he is not
[1:11:13] going to leave us where he found us at
[1:11:16] he's given you another
[1:11:20] opportunity you remember when William
[1:11:22] brandom brother mam goes over to that
[1:11:24] building over in Kentucky it's called
[1:11:26] the hayburn building I don't even think
[1:11:28] it's there it might be still there now
[1:11:30] but brother BR brother brandom is riding
[1:11:32] that elevator he's riding that elevator
[1:11:34] with some ministers one
[1:11:36] day and they got up here to the eighth
[1:11:38] floor and said well I guess this about
[1:11:40] as high as we ever going to get I guess
[1:11:43] this about as high as we ever get we
[1:11:44] better get on off here brother Bon said
[1:11:46] wait a minute that's about as high as
[1:11:48] you ever going to get on your own merits
[1:11:50] but if you got the blood on your side
[1:11:52] you can only go any higher through the
[1:11:54] blood of Jesus Christ and if your marit
[1:11:56] are only taking you to a certain plateau
[1:11:59] get off of your elevator and get onto
[1:12:02] the blood of Jesus Christ it's the
[1:12:04] greatest opportunity that you ever been
[1:12:06] given you can only live so high in your
[1:12:08] own matters and your own merits but with
[1:12:11] King Jesus the sky's a
[1:12:19] limit he said oh I'd like to say
[1:12:22] something if I can forget what I was and
[1:12:24] remember what he is if I can remember
[1:12:27] Jesus if I can remember him at the cross
[1:12:29] if I can remember what he done for me if
[1:12:32] I can remember the hour that he washed
[1:12:33] away my sins and give me the holy spirit
[1:12:36] to guide me that I'm lifted above
[1:12:38] everything that holds this Earth if I'm
[1:12:40] lifted above every Earthly thing into
[1:12:42] Heavenly places where I can fellowship
[1:12:44] with him there in his presence
[1:12:47] forgetting what I ever was forgetting
[1:12:49] all my sins and everything because they
[1:12:51] in the sea of God's forgetfulness
[1:12:53] forgetting all my past forgetting
[1:12:55] everything and remember that he made me
[1:12:59] his own by his own death he took my
[1:13:02] place William Brandon said what an
[1:13:05] opportunity that the Church of the
[1:13:06] Living God has today to rise to its feet
[1:13:09] with a witness of the baptism of the
[1:13:10] Holy Ghost and shake this world again he
[1:13:13] say oh Christian what an opportunity
[1:13:15] that we have we have opportunities that
[1:13:17] St Paul never dreamed of we have
[1:13:19] opportunities that Enoch and Elijah and
[1:13:21] all of them never had up opportunities
[1:13:24] that we have now there has never been a
[1:13:26] day like this
[1:13:30] day what are you going to do with your
[1:13:34] opportunity God's the one that gives the
[1:13:36] air but it's the bird that uses the air
[1:13:39] to
[1:13:40] fly come on somebody God is the one that

[1:15:41] jumpers he's flying up in there and he
[1:15:44] heard the sound of a mouse and if you
[1:15:46] ever heard the sound of a
[1:15:48] rat you know
[1:15:51] it that guy he he was The Story Goes
[1:15:54] that he was flying that plane and he got
[1:15:56] so worried he got so worried that that
[1:15:59] rat was going to eat up one of his
[1:16:00] instruments that would tell him how high
[1:16:02] he was and all of these other
[1:16:03] instruments and he got so worried and
[1:16:05] shook up about
[1:16:06] it and he said but all of a sudden I
[1:16:09] remembered that rat was built for the
[1:16:13] ground he was built to burrow himself in

[1:16:28] wires less I could hear him he said the
[1:16:30] higher I got he said the worry left me
[1:16:32] and he said when I landed he said a rat
[1:16:34] fell out of my
[1:16:36] plane you see what I'm trying to tell
[1:16:38] you is if you can let your worries go
[1:16:41] and just go up there where your problems

[1:49:35] seated I'm 62 years
[1:49:38] old I have preached almost 40
[1:49:41] years but as of this moment I feel more
[1:49:45] committed than I ever have
[1:49:48] before now after 4 years years I have
[1:49:50] faced and stood in the Lion's
[1:49:54] Den but I still stood on this
[1:49:59] message this is when
[1:50:01] courage has been put to the
[1:50:04] test we Face test we Face trials you may
[1:50:07] never face brain cancer or lung C
[1:50:11] cancer but remember before that this
[1:50:14] whole journey took place God spoke to us
[1:50:17] said if you will trust me right
[1:50:21] if you will trust me I will use you like
[1:50:24] never
[1:50:26] before Jesus stood before one of his
[1:50:28] greatest tests before the government and
[1:50:32] Jesus answered and said my kingdom is
[1:50:36] not of this
[1:50:40] world if my kingdom were of this world
[1:50:42] then would my servants fight that I
[1:50:45] should not be
[1:50:47] delivered to the
[1:50:49] Jews but now is my kingdom not from
[1:50:52] hence and pilate therefore said unto him
[1:50:56] art thou the king then and Jesus
[1:50:59] answered thou
[1:51:02] sayest that I am a king now notice as he
[1:51:06] points it together to this end was I
[1:51:10] born and for this cause came I into the
[1:51:13] world that I should bear witness unto
[1:51:16] the truth everyone that is of the truth
[1:51:21] heareth my
[1:51:24] voice I want to share a quote with you
[1:51:27] our desire is not to be
[1:51:30] glorified our desire is not to have some
[1:51:34] big name our desire is not to boast some
[1:51:38] church or make make more in the Sunday
[1:51:41] school or try to bring in and hul tie
[1:51:44] and push in and offer a picnic party or
[1:51:46] bring stars or buttons or something like
[1:51:49] that that's not our desire our desire is
[1:51:53] to see
[1:51:55] him
[1:51:58] glorified glorified what not with self-
[1:52:01] pride but in but in us our lives to
[1:52:05] prove that he is alive and is living in
[1:52:11] us that's what our desire is tonight now
[1:52:15] notice this nothing great has ever taken
[1:52:20] place unless it was put under
[1:52:23] pressure God chose you to being an
[1:52:26] infinite God he knew what time to birth
[1:52:29] you he know what time to BR bring you
[1:52:31] into the Earth and he didn't give you
[1:52:34] some just easy
[1:52:37] way he knew the trials that you were
[1:52:40] going to be
[1:52:41] handed and he put something on the
[1:52:44] inside of
[1:52:46] you more than just human grip more than
[1:52:50] just human strength he put himself on
[1:52:54] the inside of you and God's Got
[1:52:57] Confidence like he had in job and
[1:52:59] confidence like he had in Abraham he's
[1:53:01] got confidence in
[1:53:05] you that you'll make it there'll be
[1:53:07] times to where that you feel like I'm
[1:53:09] going to fail I'm going to turn loose
[1:53:11] you got urges that you'll quit you feel
[1:53:13] like I don't have energies to go on
[1:53:15] anymore that's when you realize it's not
[1:53:18] you but it's him
[1:53:20] [Applause]
[1:53:22] count it all
[1:53:24] joy count it all joy when you go into
[1:53:27] some incredible Temptations of your life
[1:53:31] statements that have been made that
[1:53:33] prove courage Patrick Henry was riding
[1:53:37] through our neighborhood here call
[1:53:39] Pepper and as you were riding through
[1:53:41] call Pepper there was a man that was in
[1:53:44] stocks and that man had been thrown out
[1:53:47] of the church and he refused to preach
[1:53:50] the Ang Anglican Church doctrines they
[1:53:53] throwed him out and they were going to
[1:53:55] kill him there and he would die his last
[1:53:58] sermon as he would preach is Give me
[1:54:03] liberty or give me
[1:54:08] death I'd like to say this to you
[1:54:10] tonight we will not turn back we will
[1:54:14] not compromise we will not give in so
[1:54:18] Give me liberty or give me
[1:54:25] death Patrick kenry W went into the
[1:54:28] walls of our of our government at that
[1:54:30] time and stood up amongst
[1:54:33] peers and it was not popular and he
[1:54:36] screamed what a preacher said that
[1:54:38] inspired him Give me
[1:54:42] liberty or give me
[1:54:45] death thank
[1:54:48] God there was a man that was losing a
[1:54:51] battle and his ship seemed to be blown
[1:54:55] apart and the enemy pulled up beside of
[1:54:58] him and screamed at him are you ready to
[1:55:00] give up and John Paul Jones said I have
[1:55:04] not begun to fight
[1:55:07] yet you may be wounded you may be
[1:55:10] battered but if there's something on the
[1:55:12] inside of you just tell the devil this
[1:55:15] morning you don't realize it but I have
[1:55:18] not begun to fight yet
[1:55:24] brother George Washington prayed all
[1:55:27] night
[1:55:29] long before going across some icy
[1:55:33] waters knowing that maybe some of his
[1:55:36] comrades would pass and not live through
[1:55:40] the next
[1:55:41] day but he didn't back up from the
[1:55:45] battle as he prayed all night he knew
[1:55:47] that he was praying to somebody that
[1:55:50] could hear and answer
[1:55:52] prayer and the next day bullet holes
[1:55:55] would go through his jacket but the God
[1:55:58] that he prayed
[1:56:01] to was more able than all of the bullets
[1:56:05] of the enemy the god that you pray
[1:56:10] to is greater than your
[1:56:18] battle one of the greatest
[1:56:23] generals of World War II made an
[1:56:26] incredible
[1:56:28] statement I shall return
[1:56:35] return it had a tough
[1:56:37] battle but he was not backing
[1:56:42] off a precious sister in
[1:56:46] Florida who fought many battles incl
[1:56:49] including
[1:56:50] poverty I had the wonderful opportunity
[1:56:52] to sit and listen to her singing and
[1:56:54] listen to her and she had a lot of
[1:56:57] battles in her life but this is one of
[1:57:00] the songs that has always stuck with me
[1:57:03] it's going to take a stronger wind than
[1:57:13] this I was raised in the
[1:57:16] church Message Church

[1:57:25] church he stood about 4 fo8 he had huge
[1:57:30] hands and he would had a dwarf disease
[1:57:33] but they said if he had not had that
[1:57:35] disease he would have been a
[1:57:37] giant they put him in the army they
[1:57:41] drafted him and put him in the Army and
[1:57:43] he became a chef not just anybody's chef
[1:57:46] but he was a chef for General George
[1:57:51] Patton and so he walked side by side

[1:58:09] tracks and General Patton made his way
[1:58:12] toward the
[1:58:13] front brother Bale would say when he got
[1:58:16] to the front there was a farmer with a
[1:58:18] mule
[1:58:20] that refused to go forward and refused
[1:58:24] to get out of the road and patton said
