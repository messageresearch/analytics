George [Applause] oh yeah aren't you thankful that he abides a seat Amen what a privilege to say that the King abides in your heart Amen it's so wonderful to be back in the house of the Lord and to see each and every one of you this evening a man we want to be remembering our pastor as he's there in Ohio some meeting has already started just now and so we just pray that God would minister through our brother in a supernatural way and we also want to be remembered next weekend he will be at brother Hammad's annual meeting so we just want to remember those things in prayer also we'll be praying for brother Matthew tomorrow even and he'll be speaking for us and also brother Jason Jackson has been mentioned November 9th and 10th will be with us and we also always enjoy having brother Jason ease his brother brother Homer would always say General Jackson has coming to town so so we're a privilege to have brother Jason coming and so we just ask that the Lord would remember these sayings and minister through the brothers in a supernatural way and we are certainly looking forward to what God has in store I believe as children of God that we are not just having a revival here and there but I believe that it's a constant revival as we walk into the pulpit this evening it's just the atmosphere of revival that's where it's where God's children are living at it's where they're feeding at and it's it's a time where the word is bringing us to our feet and it's a time in which it's read the word has been restored and we know where we stand that in this hour and his brother William was praying as we can come boldly to him we don't have to back up we know who we are we know who we believe in were the call of God the elected of God and we stand upon God's Word I'd like to share something with you this evening before we we go in service towards the word last weekend that brother Tim Pruitt's church but the Timothy was ministering there and they had a young brother from Denver Colorado that came to their service on that Sunday and he'd been streaming their services for quite some time and he said he just had to come and be in one of those services and and hear hear his favorite preachers and hear his favorite singers and he said he said I just got to be in that he said I got to be in that and one of their services so he got himself a plane he got himself i he got himself a ticket flew flew down flew down to Louisiana little Saturday it went to the rental car place and the rental place told him so you're too young to get a rental car you won't be able to you won't be able to rent one here so he ended up having to stay the night in the airport there so the next morning he woke up he freshened himself up and put his suit coat on and he went down to the rental car place said look I'm going to church and I need a ride they said well you can't get a rental car here and that manager behind the desk asked him so where are you going and so he showed him the address to brother Tim's church there and he said come on took him out to a Dodge Charger the manager took off from his work to take him to church which is over an hour away and then have to drive back so not only did God had to put it on this young man's heart to be in that service but he had to put it upon that managers heart to take him there oh if we would have that kind of desire tonight just to be in the presence of the king I'd say if a young man could come all the way from Denver what about us tonight we're here in his presence and we can ask what we have need of of him and he'll speak to our hearts no matter what your desire is he knows your thoughts afar off that's the kind of God that we're serving this I believe that you the children of God have that kind of desire to see him face to face the Greeks came and said we would see Jesus but they missed him but we can see Jesus we can see Jesus tonight all we have to do is simply believe amen amen I want to sing a song tonight I don't even know if they've got it on the on on the words up there but you move mountains you cause the walls to fall you perform miracles by your power perform miracles there is nothing

know the enemy would would like to block us tonight but father we break through that wall in the name of Jesus pray God that you'd have the preeminence in this service may receive glory and honor and praise for now father I yield myself to you one more time use me for the upbuilding of that key in Jesus name if you have your Bibles this evening we will turn to the book of Genesis chapter 20 and verse 1 and if you don't know where the book of Genesis is it's at the very front of your bobbum Genesis chapter 20 Genesis 20 and verse 1 and Abraham notice not Abram but Abraham a man that has had a name change a man that has met Melchizedek a man that has had a body change and Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country and dwelt between Kadesh and Shur and sinned in career and Abram Abraham said of as' of Sarah his wife she is my sister and Abimelech king of Greer sent and took Sarah but God came to Abimelech in a dream by night and said to him behold thou art but a dead man for the woman which thou has taken for she is a man's wife but a bimolecular and he said Lord wilt thou slay also a righteous nation said he not unto me she is my sister and she even she herself said he is my brother in the integrity of my heart and the NSE of my hands have I done this and God said unto Him in a dream yea I know that thou did is this in the integrity of thine heart for I also with healthy from sinning against me therefore suffered ah thee not to touch her now therefore restore the man his wife for he is a prophet and he shall pray for thee and thou shalt live and if thou shalt restore her not thou that thou that thou know that thou shalt surely die now and all that are thine a man may God bless his word he may be seated in the presence of the Lord I'd like to read a portion of the thoughts are in church aging and here the Prophet is here the Prophet I've asked your brothers to put the quote up for us this evening here the Prophet is dealing with with the churches the the two churches and we know that there's always been twins of every revival that there's been that there was Cain and Abel and there was Esau and Jacob and and Judas and Jesus and even now the Holy Spirit and the Antichrist and the the false church and the true church but here the Prophet is asking the question of what churches will be those that that do not know this truth and we know of course that it is the false vine because the believer certainly know who they are and they know they know where their life comes from and here we pick it up it says now why does God call these churches his churches even though they are the false vine the truth of the matter is that they are Christians but they are not Christians of the Spirit they are Christians of the flesh they are bearing the name in vain mark seven and seven says howbeit in vain do they worship Me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men but indeed they are Christians for what else could they be a is a this that is his religion and no matter how he lives it because he subscribes in theory to what the Quran teaches in the same way a Christian is a christian as long as he subscribes to the fact that Jesus is the Son of God born of a virgin was crucified and died and rose again that he is the savior of mankind etcetera in fact in the Laodicean age there will be those who call themselves Christians because they subscribe to the fine qualities of Jesus while reserving to themselves the right to deny his deity Christian scientists have done that already as well as multitudes who preached a social gospel he is a nominal Christian and belongs to the church notice but he is not a true or spiritual believer that kind of a believer is one who has been baptized into the body of Christ and is a member of him we recognize to be a Christian is to be christ-like have the mind of Christ to have the life of Christ you see there are many people that call themselves Christians but if there's no life there to back up what they say then it's just words of utterance of what they are subscribing themselves to or what they have what they have made an attendance to but you see this is not about this is not about just knowing just knowing that Jesus was the son of God but this is about the life of God living in a people living in a people that was called by his namesake tonight I like to speak to you on a thought that was birthed last weekend in us in our sermon that we are breaching on anointed to fly higher I like to speak to you this thought on this is where I belong this is where I belong and truly we live in a world that is a place where we don't fit in we don't fit in here we're not in with the who's who we're not in with the in-crowd of the day when the world has their parties were not invited when the world has their social events were not invited because we know they know what we stand for you we don't fit in with their cliques and we don't fit in with their crowds you see I don't belong to this world and neither does this world attached itself to me you see neither do we belong to the Laodicean Church you see this flyer this revival that we have the Laodicean Church didn't give it to us the Laodicean Church is cold and formal they don't they they don't know what they believe in there they're lukewarm they they're neither cold nor hot this world this world knows nothing of what we live in this day they do not understand the power that that you are packing in your mortal being tonight the world don't understand it we don't fit in with this world we don't belong to the world we don't belong to the world but we do long to a living God we do belong to the kingdom of peace we do belong to the kingdom of righteousness to a kingdom of purity and holiness that's the kingdom that we belong to we belong to a headship in that headship is Christ our headship is not in Rome our headship he's in glory are you with me hello somebody will I die when I die what you know I'm not going I'm not going to be buried over in some Catholic in some Catholic ma mosque or some Catholic place but when I die I'm going to my headship I'm going to where I belong are you with me tonight as Christians we've already got to ourselves we've already died too I think it we've already died for who we are we have mortified the deeds of the flesh we've already died after that thinking that's what I was speaking to sister Sarah and the family there we don't have to worry about a Christian that is going on the other side we have to worry about them or what their state is going to be we know that that there if this earthly tabernacle beat us off that we have one imperfection waiting on us are you with me this message will produce the life of Christ because it is Christ this message this message is not a book this message is not a picture this message is not a prophet this message is a person and that person is Christ Jesus and I believe that we're standing here in this moment as a witness that his presence has changed us I believe that's why we don't have to worry about calling you up on Saturday and Sunday are you going to be a church this weekend or have to have some kind of social event to get you here it's because this message has to the work in your life this presence has changed you this presence makes you live right this presence make you make you talk right it makes you dress right i and now I want you to raise your hand this evening if if I personally called you and told you how to dress before you came to the service there's no hands up I personally didn't call you and tell you that that you need that that you needed to do this or you knew do that you do this because of what because this word says so and I never called you of the pastor never called you and said now look we're gonna wear our skirts as long sisters and we don't cut our hand we don't put ear bobs in our ears and we don't paint herself up like Jezebel we don't do those things there's not there's not one pastor but the Homer Butler on a brother answer never called you up and told you and said this is how we're going to do things but we have simply preached this gospel and this gospel has produced what you are seeing before you tonight this message produces life are you with me this evening this message produces life turn a neighbor said this message produces life the first time brother Murphy wall and his wife came into the - it may have been the second time for the Murphy came into service but the first time his wife sister Tracy came into the presence and came to church for the very first time she sent there she sat there in in her worldly garb as she sent there she sat there and had makeup on her face and had earrings in her ears and brother Murphy where they were sitting through the service there and they were sitting through the service and and sister Tracy got up and left the service for a little bit but the Murphy thought that maybe she was mad or for some reason because of the preaching of the word and when she came back in when she came back in she had the ear bobs out of her ears and she had the makeup washed off of her face now the amazing thing about this is sister Tracy did not know one word of English what was it it was the presence of Almighty God that changed that sister she recognized that she wanted to be clean in his presence it was his presence that was heaven to sister Tracy the reason why preach to you tonight is big his presence is happened to me the reason I dance like I do sing like I do is because his presence has changed me hallelujah you see as we were speaking last weekend of that Eagle you see that eagle did not belong on the ground with the chickens but he belongs in a place that was designed for him to live in you see the chicken is an Earthbound bird because it was designed to live in that kind of condition he belongs there he was born and built for the place in which he was going to be placed in and the eagle he was built for the place that he belonged the eagle was built to soar the eagle was built to fly above every other bird he was built for the place that was designed for him you are built for this you were built for this message but before you ever got here there was a message oh my before you ever got here this message was already here for you before you ever arrived there was a promise now that you are built for the promise and you're just living out what the promise has said about now the Bible says in Deuteronomy 29 and 29 that the secret things belong unto the Lord our God but those things which are revealed belonging to us and our children forever that we may do all the words of this law notice that's the hidden that the head in place that's the place where we've got to come to me that's the place where God reveals his secret is in the hidden place that's the place where God does the placing and calling is in that hidden secret moment in that head in place which is Christ Jesus it's in that spot in which he reveals himself you know I find amongst people many times as people are going through life that that people they're looking and they're searching for their calling they're searching for their purpose they're searching of what they're going to do in life I truly do not believe that a person goes through life desiring to run aimlessly through life but I believe that a person I believe that a person desires to to have to to be something in life to do something in life I believe that people that have ambition will do something in life but there is the occasion of a bum every once in a while that has no ambition that they have no they have no leadership they just they just go from here or there they they have no ambition they have no power to control them but I believe as sons and daughters of God that it is our ambition to do for the kingdom of God I believe it is I ambition to be about the Father's business I believe that it is our desire that we not run aimlessly here and there carried about with every wind of doctrine but we stand upon the solid basis of God's Word but I believe it's the desire of sons and daughters of God to find that place that God intended us to be at a place where we belong you know I have you find it amongst amongst the Christendom of today that they want to belong to something they want to belong to a group or they want to belong to a denomination or Association they want to belong to something they want to belong but I want you to know that that Israel never had a World Council of Churches Israel never had a UN or never had a League of Nations because you see they didn't need a Council they were standing upon thus saith the Lord and as the Church of the Living God we don't need a world council of churches we don't need a League of Nations we don't need a Council I cancel its that saith the Lord our head shippers are thinking hallelujah but I believe that we as sons and daughters of God should find that ambition and find our purpose in life and run with everything that's within us we should lay aside every weight and see this is more about talking to you about a purpose of you finding that purpose and you going out and living out that purpose and in a natural realm but this is you finding your purpose in the kingdom of heaven finding where you belong if your job is to sing you sing if your job is just to clap maybe you clap offbeat you clap with everything that's within you you find that place in which you belong and you stay there I was telling the young people last week of I believe it was last week I was telling them about when there when one thing that dad had taught me in business is when you find the channel in which God blesses you you stay in that channel you stay in that channel you don't move to somebody else's position or move to somebody else or try to be like somebody else you stay where God's blessing you at you see David got in trouble when he started to do something that was not in his position and every time that you move into a spot that you are not called to do God cannot bless you when you're not in that Channel I read a statement yesterday that none of us can do everything but all of us can do something it may be just one little one little thing but let us do if all that's within us when God starts to work god finishes our work this message don't prop you up this message doesn't just keep your flow this message makes you live right before you ever got here when you was trying to figure out your purpose before you momma and daddy ever tried or thought of you before you was ever born God predetermined your are you coming here he determined predetermined your calling and your election and he returned predetermined your path and he's determined to see you did to it and we're elected to live it out the Bible says in Psalms 32 and 8 that I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go and I will guide thee with my knife we're not depending on our own sight for a Christian don't live by side a Christian lives by faith we're not depending upon our side but he said that he'd be our sight that he'd be our God and we're not looking through the eyes of our own sight we're looking through the eyes of faith through the eyes of an eagle and that that eye sees all the way out it's already seen you in victory hallelujah this word belong it means to be the property of of a person or a thing to be attached or bound by the youth or a skirt excuse me to be bound by birth an allegiance or dependency to be a member of a club or an organization or set to be an attribute a part of be a part of belonging to I belong to the Spencer family because I was born in the Spencer family I have the attributes of a Spencer because of my birth you see I'm bound to the Spencer family because of my birth I belong to it you see you'll see I never worried about if I was adopted or not I never went around ask your mama why do I look this way I look at the pictures on the wall and I can see why I look that way there's attributes in my father and in my mother in which it's displayed in my own human vessel I know that I came from the Spencer lineage and you know I belong to that Switzer family I'm bill to them by birth no matter if I get in a car act no matter the state I'm in no matter if I get mangled in a car wreck or no matter if I get tore up I'm still a Switzer no matter my state of mind I'm still a Spencer no matter how dark things get in my life I'm still a Spencer no matter the time or I go through in life I'm still a Spencer do you hear me preaching to you tonight no matter what you go through you are always a son the Bible says in Ephesians 2 in 19 therefore we are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow-citizens with the Saints and of the household of God that's where you belong and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets Jesus Christ Himself being the chief Cornerstone in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto a holy temple in the Lord in whom he also are builded together for a habitation of God through the spirit as American citizens we stand here and we're identified on every level as an American and all of his same in all of his glory when he wins the battle when it loses the battle we're Americans I'm proud to be an American there's no other place on earth that I'd rather live but in America the reason why we have the ability to worship tonight in our freedom like we do is because of America fighting for our rights of freedom of worship I stand as an American tonight there's some times that maybe we get ashamed of it but I'm identified with it I belong to it are you with me we are citizens of another Kingdom we are citizens of the kingdom of God and we wave our nations flag very high Jehovah is our bear I'm not ashamed to waive that American flag anywhere in this world and I'm not ashamed to wave this Holy Ghost wherever I go jehovah is my banner jehovah is my peace jehovah is my righteousness jehovah is my buckler jehovah is my shield i belong to him hallelujah you see when i took my wife and when my wife took on my name as a spencer you see there's no disrespect to the Morgan family or any person that is any woman that is taking on their husband's name but she as a Morgan went to a higher level not because he was taken on the Spitzer name per se but she was becoming United with a headship she was becoming United with a person that has swore to protect her a person that would provide for her a person that was sustained for her a person that would be her head it brought her to another level when she took that step up on the stage she was identifying that she wanted to be one with me and when you took that step by the invisible union of God you are identified with him you may have been awakened maybe 10 years or 20 years ago but you are identified with him before there ever was a molecule or an atom spoken to existence come on somebody you are in God's mind before the world began whoo hallelujah when you look down at the dirt and you look at the dirt and you bow your head sometimes and you just get down because of the troubles of life you remember that God thought of you before the dirt was ever here Valerie but she became connected to a headship and Jesus said that if ye abide in me and my words about and you ask what you will and it shall be done to you we were people that was cut off as Gentiles we were people that the Jews thought was unredeemable but God rich in mercy where if he loved us he placed us in our position when we would be he quickened us he loved us and he placed us we were always such Alleluia we did not become see we were see therefore we could be reborn hallelujah before before I ever got here as the Spencer's Andrew Spitzer I was running up and down my father's back boat I was there but God seen me God seen that dogged that Connie Spencer would give birth to her ugly looking redheaded boy on September 1st of 1987 it wasn't no surprise it wasn't no surprise to God that I was gonna be born ugly he saw me in that condition if they got making a joke of that but God seen you in your ugliness I've seen you in your sin God seen you in your despair that's why before the world began he laid he slayed a slam and lamb slain for your found eight before the foundation of the world there was a lamb slain for you you and him are connected from eternity to eternity that's where I belong if the Eagle belongs in the sky and not on the ground with the chickens you as sons and daughters of God you do not belong on the earth you don't belong walking around here with your head hung down do you know who you are but you woke up this past week on Monday after the revival that we had last week and all of a sudden your self-confidence was just a little bit lower because somebody said something to you on your job you didn't feel quite as high that you were flying here on Sunday night as you did on Monday morning I know I know that I'm talking to a few angels but I'd say that there's some of you that went into work and somebody brought you from heavenly places back down to Laodicea and it brought your self-esteem down but this word is not about building up your self-esteem this word is not building up of how you feel around other people this word is building you to be a tabernacle for Almighty God and no matter if you feel up right now and if you feel down tomorrow you are still connected to him food trousers and many toys and temptations you still belong to him through cancer your wrist through diabetes your hair through the struggle your heels hallelujah you always was a son you see he burst us into our position and we are heir to all that he owns the Prophet would say that we belong to one body or another body he's the body of God or the body of Satan one of them you've joined to and the other one you'd be like that you're born into one of them you're a part of because you're born into it you have to be a part of it could I deny that I got an arm no more than I can deny any word of God if I'm a part of God I'm a part of William Branham I'm in parts and every part is a part of me is that right you remember when you say young kid and your momma caught you with your hand in the cookie jar and you'd always tell mom I said mom it wasn't me it was my hand and made me do it I'm the only kid in here I guess I got caught in the cookie jar but you know you can't separate your hand from the rest of your body you see if your hand did it you did rather Baron would ask a question who is me really who is me is this is this body me it's his vessel me but there's something on the inside of you that's making you tick and making you up that Satan cannot destroy he might come and torment your flesh and torment your mind but he can never get to that real you Oh hallelujah that's where you belong you're a gene seed of God no I'm just I'm just giving you eagle food right now I'm keep dropping it to ya I'm keep dropping it to you till you get it get to you get you strength up and you get out your own nest but I'm gonna keep dropping these things that you did not become seed by the rebirth but you are see therefore you could be reborn you always wash funds you were never you were never a servant you are son oh come oh somebody God God did it didn't have a hard time figuring out well they any mini money mo catch a tiger by his toe if he hollers let him go I choose this one I'll choose that one God thought of you the devil likes to put it in your mind that you did something or you did some kind of action to make God choose you it was not your goodness it was not so worse it was his righteousness it was his election his predestination his determining that made you who you are and I belong to the headship that birthed me [Applause] [Music] hallelujah every word of God has to fit my spirit has to fit my soul has to fit my living it has to fit my ideas if my ideas is contrary to that then God's Spirit don't dwell in me you can't deny one word of it you belong to one of these bodies it's got to be it's just got to be it's either the body of God which is by the word about or the body of Satan by the church and the whole world will have to belong to some church it worship some God you got to worship either the God of knowledge or your lie upon your upon what you hear by knowledge you rely upon this that or the other or you're alive when God's Word by faith watching for him to vindicate it and make it true this body I'm just going to preach I'm going to preach like you belong to this body if that's alright with you I'm going to preach like you are a part of the body of Jesus Christ now you don't belong to the body of Satan and you don't belong to the body of knowledge but you belong to the body of this world let me say it to you like this you're not feeding on the mind of a man you're feeding on the unfailing body Word of the Son of Man and let me tell you this that this body that you belong to are you identify with it this body is full of power this body is full of truth this body is full of joy this body is full of healings and miracles this body is full of faith this body eight for a warrior in doubt and fear this body is full of faith because it is the same life same power same word I don't know what this is doing to you out there but what it's going to me I feel ten feet tall right now let there be a girl I raise up right now and I'll start swinging this sling of the word and I'll start cutting down his head he's come against you this week and boasted to you this week that you're not going to make it why don't you take his sword and cut his head off hello little David's you always wore sons before David was anointed he was annoying it before you got to this message you were born to live this message if you don't look at a picture brother Danny maybe twenty or thirty years ago you'd have thought that he belonged to something else but he always he always he always he always belonged to this body how about you brother brother Mike Buchanan good night always talk about you coming in here with your hippie hair but before before you were Mike Buchanan you belong to God Oh hallelujah I don't preach this message because I'm a part of the Frazier family I don't preach this message because there's eight eight different eight different preachers in my lineage of the Spencer family I preach this message because I was born to preach this message I live this message not because the wife I marry are the people I'm connected to I live this message because the message is living its way out of me [Applause] we're not relying upon what we think we're not relying upon how we feel we're relying upon God's worth and if it looks like it ain't coming and if it looks like it ain't gonna happen hold on hold on faith says it's coming too fast surpass faith says it's going to happen and if that's your if that's your speech and if that's your thinking you could say this is where I belong when everybody else is criticizing me for believing yes this is where I belong at I'd say that Abraham and Sarah were criticized for believing that they were going to have a son help me preach right here I'd say that they were criticized by all kinds of people saying there you're gonna be the father of Nations and you don't even have you only have a son but Abraham could stand there and say this is where I belong that I don't belong in town I don't belong in recent Eve lived in a perfect spot lived in a place of perfection a place in which she belong that but reason took her out of that spot the place in which she belonged to reason came and stole her away and the same enemy today he's raising up his head of Reese and trying to reason its way out make its way so that you got to figure all these things out but you don't belong in reason you are not birthed by reason I'm preaching to the body of Christ you don't belong in recently you were not birthed by recent you were not birthed by doubt you were not birthed by fear you were not burst by your stigma you are not birthed by your complex you are not burst by suicide you are birthed by faith this is where I belong that Abraham would say you see God can only bless Israel when she's in her homeland every time she got out of her homeland she got in trouble and when you get out on Satan's territory God can't bless you you don't belong in doubt you don't belong in fear you don't belong in all these things of the world you belong in thus saith the Lord God can't bless you when you're out there having a party with the rest of the world jesus said that you cannot serve God and Mammon at the same time God can't bless you the I can't bless you while you're dancing in the spirit and drinking line at the same time God can't bless you while you're looking at things on the internet that you shouldn't be looking at when you're trying to get the Holy Ghost i'ma preach to you anyhow God can't bless you when you're dabbling in drugs and alcohol when you're asking for an anointing that'll make you fly high but God will bless you when you stand upon thus saith the word that's where God will bless you that's we're gonna fill you that's where God will change you on the word hallelujah hallelujah this word this word lips little bottom said that this word produces itself that's beautiful right there this word produces itself it'll produce the same kind of life it'll produce the same nature that that the lamb had you see a pig's nature will produce a big life and when people live like dogs it'll produce a dog life you see they're attached - those things by a birth by the life they're living it shows you where they're born from Ali let me move on for somebody strings me up this is where I belong at church see God had told Abraham in Genesis chapter 14 to lift up your eyes after he had separated himself from light he says lift up your eyes and look northward and southward and eastward look all the way around you look where you're standing that walk through this land I've given you this land it belongs to you it's your possession it's your property you were barred to inhabit it and that's where the angel of God met Abraham was in that land that's the place where Abraham was chose to live he was not chose to live down in Egypt or down in career he was chose to live in that land and when he got outside of the promised land he got in trouble you watch every time that the children of Israel got out of their homeland they get in trouble and notice Abraham as he falls in this condition as we would say it's a backslidden condition that notice that it even channels down to Isaac doing the same exact thing you see because there was no birth to fix the process the anointing would come and the anointing would go but we're not like the prophets of old have to worry about if we got the anointing a day or worried about our temper racing back up the anointing of odds the anointing stays the anointing anoint the anointing lives but he said I've given you this land this is your land and your seed that come after you this is where you belong at Abraham but as we read in our scripture reading Genesis 20 that we see as Sarah is taken by a Abimelech notice that Abimelech is less than after a 90 year old woman he no notice notice he is he is lusting after a grandma Oh hallelujah notice they have just journeyed over 300 miles to get to career could you imagine a little bit of Grandma taking a few steps here and there making a 300 mile journey but something had to happen some had to happen which was a type of you and me something had to happen that was a change after Melchizedek came I couldn't live this until he came Abraham couldn't change until Melchizedek came hallelujah Abraham was living on the outside of the tent until message that came but after he came oh she wasn't stepping like no grandma she was stepping like a 20 year old woman making a 300 mile journey and when she gets down to career there is a young for listening king that says I want this woman to be my wife are you following me this evening now notice so Abbey molesting her to be his wife and Abimelech so he was already now to be to take her to be his wife but notice what God had said to Abraham that by Sarah you're going to have this baby and he was a young man taking her and here was Abraham a hundred years old out there you see the promised son was promised to Abraham and Sarah he was not promised to Abraham and Hagar he was not promised to Sarah and Abimelech he was promised to Abraham and Sarah and God came and dealt with a bimolecular dream and said you're nothing but a dead man don't touch what was God saying this that this is my battle I have birthed her to bring for the promise come on somebody and when Sara laughed up her sleeve and says me another woman had pleasure give of my Lord God had every right to destroy Sara but because she was a part of Abraham because she was a part of the promise God could not destroy her there have been things in your life that would rightfully put you in the prison house there are things in your life that would properly say that you should be destroyed but because you are part of him because you belong to him and he built you to be a birthing ground for the Son of Man to come forth he could not destroy you hallelujah but notice notice what God said to Abimelech he says I know the integrity of your heart that's the reason I kept you from sinning against me but you restore you restore that woman for her husband is a prophet let him pray for you if you don't I'm just gonna wipe you off the face of the earth God's Word has to stand no man could touch Sarah God had made a promise you see god when this took place God set up all the rooms of every woman in the kingdom the kingdom the nation would have died right off if there would have been no restoration of Sarah no man could touch I want you to realize I want you to realize that the kingdoms of this world would completely shut down if Satan wouldn't take his hand off for you Satan has to take his hand off of God's property or the nations would shut down if Satan wouldn't do it do you realize who you are this evening that America would shut down that Germany would shut down that rest would shut down that gorilla would have shut down if the King would have not had restored Sarah back to her position of being Abraham's wife Satan has no legal right to lay his hands upon you he has no legal right to destroy your vessel he has no legal right but you as a son of God have the ability to enforce her claim and say Satan take your dirty hands off for God's property I belong to God I don't belong to cancer I don't belong to TB I belong to the God that heals all of my diseases I belong to the God that made me who I am he said take your hands off of her and here come the natural seed the natural seed had to come if it would have itself would have married that southern man the natural seed would have never been born so if God's uh protected the course for the natural seed how much more for the spiritual royal seed has he protected God would not allow a perverted seed to contain a maintainer womb that womb was built for the seed of Abraham and God would not allow the contamination of another seed to enter that room Satan has tried his very best to pervert your womb of your soul and to contaminate your mind and contaminate your spirit but you have every legal right to say Satan take your hands off of God's property Satan give them back turn them loose you realize who you are Satan give them back turn them loose you're not going to smother them out there and organizations and things there are free people you let them alone turn them loose I want you to notice this this is where you belong at since it took a few years to get here but you belong here it didn't look like it was a live ministry in your area but you belong here all this time you belong here it looked like you were an outcast but you belong here it looked like he didn't fit in but you belong here he didn't look like your feathers look like all the other feathers of the world you belong here when you started coming in brother Steven when brother Steven came in here and he started saying he came in here and he told me he told me from his lips he said I made a declaration then I was going to go to all the churches in the community and I was going to find which one had truth he said but when I came here when I came here he said this this is what he told me he said this is where I belong I know what the religions of the world have to offer I know that the god of the world has to offer he's got nothing he's got nothing but death he can offer your life he can offer you hope he can't offer you peace he can out for your happiness he can only offer you you can he can only offer you in the sight of an empty bar but the God that I'm serving can offer you peace the God that I'm serving can offer you happiness you belong right here in this birthing ground who belong right here in this in this place that was the door ordained for you that you belong to that you are chosen of Satan Estrada's very best to destroy our lives and I'm going just a little bit slower just for a moment just so you get this Satan has done is very best to destroy you and destroy your life and to destroy your integrity and destroy who you are and tell you that you're worthless but this word has come to tell you that this is the place that you've been longer I'm not talking about the physical address of this church but I'm talking about this revealed word I'm talking about I'm talking about a God that can raise you out of your condition this God can go careful now he can go to to the street rats and he can go to the alley rats and he can go to the prostitutes of the world and he is compelling them to come he's going to those that look that look like they're unredeemable he looks he's going after those that that look like there is no hope for them to come he's going after our lost loved ones careful what you think right there he's going after them with everything that's within it this is a God that doesn't lose his seed this is a God that brings his seed to the ground in which it belongs him you could not come forth you could not come forth in your beauty out there in here in the ground of the world you could not show forth your potential out there in the world you could not do it out there in the world but when God brought you to this ground when God brought you to this place and began to harass doing there so and begin to rise on that seed it brought forth everything that was laying on the inside of you the potentials that was laying on the inside of you birthed you into this kingdom Satan tried is very best to cover you up with all types of dirt with all types of sin all types of unbelief you were not born for the world you are not born for that ground you were born for this holy ground you are born for this what God knows the ground in which he or danger to be you could not produce this life out there you could not produce his life out there home but once you got transplanted Hinda this seed were into this seed ground into this ground in which God or danger to be you were born to be an eagle you were born to fly higher every time the world every time you begin to get closer to God the world kept whispering in your ear but I can offer you this and I can offer you that but this is where you belong every time you begin to make a move for God Satan kept raising his head I said but you can't do that do you remember what you did you fell in sin you made a fool of yourself you fail and there's no way to get back up it looks like it looked like all hope was gone but the Bible said that he established my goings and he set my foot up on a rock it looked as if you would never come but through all the mud through all the scars through all the pain through all the despair through every struggle something kept bringing you up something kept bringing you up this is where you belong life is about living life is about living life is not about dying the world all they have to offer you is death this is about living what the Pentecostal realm turned down what the Pentecostal round turned down and poured its way back from it was protecting you all this time hallelujah you always wore a seat he told you that you had a fine son and he is a son this is where he belongs that he always was a son this is just the birthing process that's seed in all its bulb and everything that's laying there has to come to a spot it's got to be birthed and every Son of God has to be birthed you are not born to live in chaos you were not born to live in stress you were not born to live in sickness you were born to live in perfection and Satan keeps wrapping himself around he keeps wrapping his false vine around you and says you're never coming up but there's an angel standing here there's an angel standing here and whom the Sun has set free is free ending Satan take your dirty hands off of God's property Cain Cain slew the righteous Abel but there came forth a Seth look what Cain's life produce and watch what Seth's life produced watch what Satan's hey all of his schemes and all of this ideas watch what they produce and watch what the Sun produces who can be seated I'm not done I was born to be a Fisher of men some people ask me what my career is I tell some people I study drunk people it's what I do for a living I study drunk people it's all it's it's an amazing thing to watch is watch drunks every Saturday night and watch drunks every Sunday night but they are not drunk online and alcohol they're drunk on the stimulation of Revelation this joy that I have the world didn't give it to me but also I tell people I fish for a living and I knew you I fish for a living I'm fishing I'm fishing for those that are the rainbow trout and I believe that the opening of the word is bringing in those rainbow trout I believe it's pulling in every single one that God ordained before the foundation of the world oh I was not born I was not born I was not born to live under the first and second pole then I need that I need healing I need discernment but I was born for this opening of the word oh this is where I belong this is where I belong and once that seed comes forth it was ordained for that spot to bring forth in all of its beauty there were some spots that you could not so forth their beauty but in this spot you can show forth everything that you were named for and you're equipped for the bath you see if you know who you are you know who you are not the most amount if you know you are an eagle you know you're not a chicken don't you dare allow Satan to tell you a chicken when you know that you're an eagle you are destined for the sky you are destined for the seagull eggs when man try to put his grip on you you just kept lifting higher by the revelation of this word Oh hallelujah this world out here this world is not my home I'm not a part of Laodicea but I come out of Laodicea what a glorious day it will be when we stand there with the overcomers of all the ages and they say where they came from and you tell them that you came out of the Laodicean Church nades and they begin to ask you how in the world did you overcome and you began to sing to them it was not my mind and it's not mine but by God's Spirit saith Lord you were built to overcome Laodicea you were not born to be defeated you were not born to be depleted of all your energies and be wore out you were built to live in his presence it is Satan's schemes to tear down your health your health platform and tear down all of your mind it's his scheme to do that but you belong in his presence you do but you don't belong in sickness I wish I got a little better a man there you don't belong in sickness you belong in health you don't belong in bondage you belong to deliverance you don't belong to diseases you don't belong to doubt you don't belong to Satan you don't know to god you better long in an atmosphere that revival day-in day-out I was told one time I was told one time by a person who says that you know what we feel and what we experience I don't believe we can have that every day we need to be washed of that kind of thinking we were born for heavenly places we were born for heaven to come down we were born for his spirit we were barred to get in the spirit if we were not born and we cannot have this Holy Ghost every single day and God don't pour out his spirit like he did maybe 20 years or 30 years ago in your mind said you need to be washed of that thinking you need to wake up you need to wake up and realize what God is doing here so I know some of you want to settle me and not say Amen to the word but you need to wake up and recognize what is happening here God is lifting his eagles off the ground gravitation is losing hold a car was not built to go where rocky goes but a rocket was built to go into the heavenlies we will all the way from the horse-and-buggy aid to the rocket ace who the astronaut aids and we are spiritual astronauts we're going way beyond of what Luther and Wesley and the days of Pentecost we're going on we belong there you know if I go out here in the woods in our local woods and I go to hunting and I'm sitting in my tree stand and I got everything correct I've got my Center way on I got my girl call out I got my camouflage Realtree on and I'm sitting there mosquitoes ain't flying I ain't have to worry about swatting mosquitoes but I'm sitting there waiting on what you hope is a good life that shows up in the woods but if I'm sitting there and my tree stand and everything's just right and all of a sudden a giraffe comes walking through the woods right behind that a herd of elephants come walking right down Huell it you know what I'm going to think either the circus has lost some animals or I'm in Africa don't tell me I don't tell me I don't know where I'm standing at I know exactly where I'm standing at I know exactly where you belong you see I'm not looking out here I'm not looking at things that don't belong I'm looking at things that do belong you know things that or that are in the rightful place seldom ever make the news because they're in the rightful place it does not make the news when brother Vernon goes out gets and starts his bus on Monday mornings and he drives to school because why it's where he belongs that that's his job his position it'll never make the news but yet he's going to do it because it's his position but I'll tell you what will make the news is if he runs off the road and he wrecks that thing it'll

position but when everything's in its rightful position he never makes the news it never makes the news that that you came to church on Saturday and you came to church on Sunday it never makes the news out here at the Daily News record but he makes the news in hell why because you are in your position in which you belong and when you are in your position hell gets nervous hell gets upset let me preach to you a minute hell gets nervous when you start saying a man to the word hell gets nervous when you start rising up out of your despair razzing up out of your sickness it says you know what
