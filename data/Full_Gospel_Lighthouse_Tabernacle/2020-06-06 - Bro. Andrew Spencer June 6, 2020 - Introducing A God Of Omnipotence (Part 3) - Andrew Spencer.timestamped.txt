[1:00:11] speak to you this evening just for for a
[1:00:14] second if i could and
[1:00:16] evening time i don't feel quite as well
[1:00:18] as i do in the mornings and
[1:00:20] i'm a mo bit swell this evening i feel
[1:00:24] i feel a lot of things but you know in
[1:00:28] spite of your feelings sometimes you

[1:00:32] and so we thank you for your prayers
[1:00:36] and we love you with all of our hearts
[1:00:39] and you're such a wonderful people
[1:00:44] i thought about the song that was sung
[1:00:46] and
[1:00:47] matthew sung it earlier tonight it's
[1:00:50] still the truth
[1:00:54] it's still the light
[1:00:57] it's still the message
[1:00:59] [Applause]
[1:01:03] no matter what we're going through
[1:01:09] no matter what trials we're in
[1:01:13] it's still the truth
[1:01:17] god knows what we'll be going through in
[1:01:20] our lives
[1:01:22] he's so good to us i think about the
[1:01:26] time that we're in now
[1:01:29] when the world is rioting and they
[1:01:32] really don't know what they're writing
[1:01:34] about
[1:01:36] sometimes if if we take note
[1:01:40] of all of the noise that's going on
[1:01:43] god just allows a lot of things to
[1:01:45] happen
[1:01:48] and if you look god's doing something
[1:01:54] he's doing something riots were
[1:01:58] happening in
[1:01:59] 63 and the seals were being re-released
[1:02:05] it didn't bother god's program none
[1:02:07] whatsoever
[1:02:10] and it don't bother it tonight
[1:02:14] they were rioting when when jesus was at
[1:02:18] the
[1:02:19] at the hall and they were standing there
[1:02:22] screaming
[1:02:25] and they would choose barabbas
[1:02:30] they would choose barabbas and their
[1:02:32] their jesus was
[1:02:36] today they've chosen
[1:02:39] another leader and they turned down
[1:02:42] jesus of this day
[1:02:46] once again even in this hour i think
[1:02:50] about
[1:02:50] all that's happened with covet and the
[1:02:53] different things and
[1:02:55] i i just think that god has so prepared
[1:03:00] the bride of jesus christ
[1:03:02] covet doesn't bother us
[1:03:05] [Applause]
[1:03:08] we've got a token
[1:03:11] you might get sick but we've got a
[1:03:14] doctor
[1:03:16] hallelujah i'm glad we got a doctor
[1:03:19] and he's in the house
[1:03:23] and he's a provider
[1:03:24] [Music]
[1:03:28] hallelujah
[1:03:30] brother johnny provides for us
[1:03:33] and sometimes of our lives to where that
[1:03:36] we think
[1:03:38] god's been watching over these things
[1:03:40] for years
[1:03:41] getting ready for this moment
[1:03:45] tonight you'll hear
[1:03:49] the provision to which god has made
[1:03:53] knowing these trials would come all
[1:03:56] right and i think i think when we
[1:03:59] when we listen to a message we think
[1:04:01] well it's just another sermon
[1:04:05] but i've come to learn that brother
[1:04:07] jonathan
[1:04:08] no sermon it's just another sermon
[1:04:13] amen i went back over some notes and
[1:04:18] last night i found this note
[1:04:21] brother timothy pruitt was standing
[1:04:24] in the pulpit here and if you'll
[1:04:27] remember you preached a sermon on the
[1:04:30] sound of freedom
[1:04:33] and uh toward the end of the sermon
[1:04:36] brother timothy pruitt as
[1:04:38] he's preaching on the sound of freedom
[1:04:41] he comes to the end of that note and he
[1:04:45] and he said in the war what they would
[1:04:48] do brother joe
[1:04:49] is they would they'd write a note to the
[1:04:52] enemy
[1:04:55] and he said they'd write a note to the
[1:04:58] enemy
[1:05:01] and here before we would find out about
[1:05:04] cancer
[1:05:06] he said why don't you write a note to
[1:05:08] that cancer
[1:05:09] devil
[1:05:12] that's getting ready to be released
[1:05:15] he said why don't you send him a note
[1:05:17] tonight
[1:05:19] because it's a sound of freedom

[1:05:38] i looked at that last night and that was
[1:05:42] kind of in my last
[1:05:43] thoughts of the evening i went and
[1:05:46] looked at it again
[1:05:47] i looked at it over and over during the
[1:05:49] day yesterday
[1:05:50] i don't think i even shared that with
[1:05:52] you yesterday
[1:05:54] because i didn't want to bother your
[1:05:55] thoughts for the evening
[1:05:57] but i thought you know i'm going to go
[1:06:00] to church tomorrow evening
[1:06:04] and i'm gonna sit where i set when that
[1:06:06] was sent
[1:06:10] and i'm gonna put a note on the bomb

[1:07:04] thought tonight i'm going to put a note
[1:07:06] on the bomb
[1:07:08] and there's no better place than to put
[1:07:10] the note on the bomb
[1:07:12] than sitting right here
[1:07:15] and set in the seat where the sermon was
[1:07:19] preached
[1:07:21] and while we're listening to the sermon

[1:15:19] slipped through his vessel and
[1:15:20] completely restored him
[1:15:22] i believe you're a god of restoration i
[1:15:25] believe that that is what you have came
[1:15:27] for in this
[1:15:27] hour father to show forth and declare
[1:15:30] that you're still god
[1:15:31] and i pray that you would have your will
[1:15:33] and your way in the service
[1:15:35] in the name of jesus christ and the
[1:15:37] bride says
[1:15:39] ii kings chapter 2 and 11 and the bible
[1:15:42] says here
[1:15:43] and it came to pass as they still went
[1:15:46] on
[1:15:47] and talked that behold there appeared
[1:15:50] a chariot of fire and horses of fire
[1:15:52] imparted
[1:15:53] them both asunder and elijah went up by
[1:15:56] a whirlwind
[1:15:57] into heaven and elisha saw it and cried
[1:16:00] my father my father the chariot of
[1:16:02] israel
[1:16:03] and the horsemen thereof and he saw him
[1:16:05] no more and he took hold of his own
[1:16:07] clothes
[1:16:08] and rent them into two pieces and he
[1:16:11] took up also the mantle of elijah that
[1:16:14] fell from him
[1:16:15] and went back and stood by the bank of
[1:16:18] jordan
[1:16:19] and he took the mantle of elijah that
[1:16:21] fell from him
[1:16:22] and smote the waters and said where is
[1:16:25] the lord
[1:16:25] god of elijah i'd like for you to speak
[1:16:28] those words as we repeat them again
[1:16:31] where is the lord god of elijah and when
[1:16:34] he had also smitten the waters they
[1:16:36] parted hither and thither
[1:16:38] and elisha went over may god bless his
[1:16:41] word you may be seated
[1:16:43] in the presence of the lord one other
[1:16:46] scripture reading before we
[1:16:48] dive in this evening colossians chapter
[1:16:50] 4
[1:16:51] and verse 2. now the bible says here
[1:16:53] continue in prayer
[1:16:55] and watch in the same with thanksgiving
[1:16:58] with all praying also for us that god
[1:17:00] would open unto us a door of utterance
[1:17:04] to speak the mystery for which i am also
[1:17:07] in bonds
[1:17:08] that i may make it manifest as i ought
[1:17:11] to speak now notice what paul was saying
[1:17:13] notice the humility of paul now
[1:17:16] wherewith
[1:17:17] pray also for me that
[1:17:20] god would open unto us a door of
[1:17:23] utterance to speak
[1:17:24] the mystery of christ for which i am
[1:17:26] also in bonds
[1:17:28] that i might make it manifest as i ought
[1:17:31] to speak
[1:17:32] now this message that we have declared
[1:17:35] in this message that has come to us in
[1:17:37] this day
[1:17:38] it did not come to produce another
[1:17:40] denomination it did not come to educate
[1:17:43] us into another
[1:17:44] religion it did not come to build
[1:17:46] buildings or build
[1:17:47] bigger churches or to create another
[1:17:50] another sect or
[1:17:51] another scholar or to create create
[1:17:54] theologians of the message
[1:17:56] but this message came to restore us back
[1:17:59] to the faith
[1:18:00] of the pentecostal fathers that was once
[1:18:02] delivered
[1:18:03] that this message that was delivered to
[1:18:06] us is to connect
[1:18:07] us as a body of christ to the headship
[1:18:10] of christ and it is
[1:18:12] this message that is drawing the body of
[1:18:15] christ
[1:18:16] right into the presence of god and we
[1:18:18] see as this word is circling the earth
[1:18:21] as it's going around and it's
[1:18:22] and it's finding that fertile ground as
[1:18:24] it's circling as it's moving
[1:18:26] and we see those life uh the life of the
[1:18:29] grain as it's popping up and we see
[1:18:31] that that this is a move of the of god
[1:18:35] that these things
[1:18:36] are of god and they pertain to god and
[1:18:39] and we
[1:18:40] realize that this is the same gospel
[1:18:43] that paul preached
[1:18:44] and if what paul preached produced
[1:18:46] christ then this message that we preach
[1:18:50] must produce none other than jesus
[1:18:52] christ not a man
[1:18:54] not at my ideas not brother branham's
[1:18:56] ideas but
[1:18:57] it must produce none other than jesus
[1:19:00] christ
[1:19:00] and the same angel that directed paul to
[1:19:03] preach these things
[1:19:04] must be the same angel that is directing
[1:19:06] us as a body
[1:19:08] of believers to release the unfolding
[1:19:11] and the unveiling of the mighty god as
[1:19:13] we've seen
[1:19:14] as we've seen it foretold and here we
[1:19:16] are we're living out in this
[1:19:18] last gentile dispensation that god is
[1:19:21] calling out a people for his namesake
[1:19:24] he has not come just to create another
[1:19:26] church
[1:19:27] he has not just come to create just
[1:19:29] another religion
[1:19:30] but he has called to come call you out
[1:19:33] call you out of the world call you out
[1:19:35] of laodicea call you out of your
[1:19:37] sickness
[1:19:38] call you out of your diseases call you
[1:19:40] out of your situation
[1:19:41] call you out of your circumstances the
[1:19:44] god of the message
[1:19:45] is the god of the bible and the same
[1:19:48] pillar of fire that was moving and
[1:19:50] leading the children of israel
[1:19:52] is the same pillar of fire that is
[1:19:54] directing us it's the same pillar of
[1:19:56] fire that is moving
[1:19:57] us it's the same pillar fire that is
[1:19:59] here it's the same pillar of fire that
[1:20:02] will heal your body
[1:20:03] it's the same pillar of fire the angel
[1:20:05] of the covenant that will not back off
[1:20:07] of his word one iota
[1:20:09] no matter what is coming up against him
[1:20:12] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:20:14] forever
[1:20:15] and if he had power then he's got power
[1:20:17] now if he healed cancer then he heals
[1:20:19] cancer now
[1:20:20] if he delivered from sugar diabetes he
[1:20:22] delivers right now
[1:20:24] if he saves a loss he saves a loss now
[1:20:27] if he goes after the prodigals then he
[1:20:29] goes after the prodigals now
[1:20:31] he's not changing he's the lord our god
[1:20:34] and he changes not
[1:20:36] you are what you are watching and what
[1:20:38] you are seeing
[1:20:39] is just an introduction of who the
[1:20:41] mighty god is unveiled before us
[1:20:44] what you see what i present to you what
[1:20:47] the ministers of this message present to
[1:20:49] you
[1:20:50] is not a god that is dead but a god that
[1:20:52] is living
[1:20:53] a god that is a boy god that is capable
[1:20:55] a god
[1:20:56] is of the bible that is here and that is
[1:20:59] omnipotent
[1:21:00] that is omnipresent that is omniscient
[1:21:03] he's all-knowing
[1:21:04] he's everywhere and because he knows all
[1:21:07] things he can be
[1:21:08] everywhere and him being able to know
[1:21:10] everything
[1:21:11] he can show forth his majesty as the
[1:21:14] omnipotent god
[1:21:15] the all-powerful now we realize that his
[1:21:18] name is not omnipotent
[1:21:19] but that is a title that we realize that
[1:21:22] he
[1:21:23] is fulfilling that portion of that
[1:21:26] declaration that i
[1:21:27] am the omnipotent god now his name is
[1:21:30] not omnipotent but that is who he is
[1:21:32] his name is not often the present but
[1:21:34] that is who he is
[1:21:36] and when isaiah was standing there and
[1:21:38] then he seen
[1:21:39] when he seen the future coming of of the
[1:21:42] christ
[1:21:43] child as he's looking out there and it
[1:21:45] would be seven
[1:21:46] some some seven hundred and eight
[1:21:47] hundred years as isaiah
[1:21:49] is speaking those things and he sees as
[1:21:52] the christ is coming
[1:21:54] that unto us a child is born and unto us
[1:21:57] a son
[1:21:57] is given and the government shall be
[1:21:59] upon his shoulders
[1:22:00] that he shall be called wonderful now
[1:22:03] that is not his name
[1:22:04] he shall be called counselor now that is
[1:22:07] not his name
[1:22:08] but he shall be called the mighty god he
[1:22:11] shall be called
[1:22:12] the prince of peace the everlasting
[1:22:14] father now we realize
[1:22:16] that those are not his name but isaiah
[1:22:19] was
[1:22:19] looking at the christ and declaring that
[1:22:22] he
[1:22:23] was the almighty god and to think about
[1:22:26] a prophet that could look
[1:22:27] into the future be in an eagle eye he
[1:22:30] could look there
[1:22:31] and see the christ child he could see
[1:22:33] him as he is
[1:22:35] now if isaiah could see him as he was
[1:22:38] 800 years before what about today
[1:22:42] as he's looking about upon a body on a
[1:22:45] body that is called after his name
[1:22:47] that is taken on his name that believes
[1:22:50] in his name
[1:22:51] he has not seen you down here as a weak
[1:22:54] bride
[1:22:54] but a mighty bride
[1:22:59] and he's living in a people and
[1:23:00] declaring that he
[1:23:02] is the mighty god
[1:23:07] are you with me now the bible says in
[1:23:10] deuteronomy 10 and 17 for the lord your
[1:23:12] god
[1:23:14] how many is is he your god tonight for
[1:23:16] the lord your god is god of god's and
[1:23:18] and lord of lords and great a great god
[1:23:21] a mighty
[1:23:22] and a terrible which regardeth not
[1:23:24] persons
[1:23:26] nor taketh reward now the prophet said
[1:23:29] this in the sardisian church age
[1:23:31] he said god is god and because he is god
[1:23:34] one cannot defeat his counsels or thwart
[1:23:37] his will and purpose but him
[1:23:39] but he being omnipotent is ruling in all
[1:23:43] affairs and doing whatever he will
[1:23:46] with all his creation because all were
[1:23:48] created
[1:23:49] for his good pleasure now i have to say
[1:23:52] that there are some days in my life that
[1:23:54] i wish i was god
[1:23:55] that i could maybe move certain things
[1:23:57] or do certain things but i am sure glad
[1:24:00] that i am not god are you with me and
[1:24:03] i'm glad you know that i'm not god
[1:24:05] you'll never believe you'll never have
[1:24:06] to worship me as being god you've seen
[1:24:08] too many mistakes in me
[1:24:10] but i'd have to i'd hate to have to
[1:24:12] think that i would have to be god
[1:24:14] and have to rule in all the affairs of
[1:24:17] men there's a lot of things that i don't
[1:24:19] even want to know about my own self
[1:24:21] but here god is ruling in all of the
[1:24:23] affairs of humanity
[1:24:25] and he's declaring himself as the
[1:24:28] omnipotent god
[1:24:30] and we see that very from the very
[1:24:32] beginning of revelations chapter 1
[1:24:34] that he is the mighty god and he is
[1:24:37] walking
[1:24:38] in the midst of his church
[1:24:41] and now now bear with me i'd like to
[1:24:43] read this quote that i read last week
[1:24:45] and again from the second-handed robe
[1:24:47] he said but when he came down speaking
[1:24:49] of elijah and elisha
[1:24:51] and when he came down to the jordan to
[1:24:53] face the critical world
[1:24:55] what did he cry where is the god of
[1:24:58] elijah it wasn't the robe of elijah that
[1:25:00] done it
[1:25:01] it was the power of god of elijah that
[1:25:04] done it and the thing the world needs
[1:25:06] this morning
[1:25:07] is the power of the god of elijah he
[1:25:10] said you might have spoke of tongues and
[1:25:12] shouted and run over the floor
[1:25:14] but what we need is the power of the god
[1:25:16] of pentecost
[1:25:18] to produce the lives and things that was
[1:25:21] lived in that day in the apostolic hour
[1:25:24] a second-handed robe was all right but
[1:25:26] he needed a fresh call in his heart from
[1:25:28] god
[1:25:29] he needed a fresh anointing from god he
[1:25:31] wore a second-handed robe
[1:25:33] when he came to the river but he needed
[1:25:35] a brand new first-handed call from god
[1:25:38] and a first-handed power from god to
[1:25:40] perform
[1:25:41] the miracle and a first-handed power
[1:25:44] from god to perform the miracle
[1:25:47] so he realized that he was not walking
[1:25:49] down there on his own accord
[1:25:51] that if he walked down there and all of
[1:25:53] the critics of the world
[1:25:54] was on that side of the river that he
[1:25:56] would be shown
[1:25:58] as just a mortal man but he needed a
[1:26:02] first-handed power from god now you
[1:26:05] know this in a in a circumstance or any
[1:26:07] situation as a human saying
[1:26:10] that you realize that you needed a god
[1:26:12] that was bigger than your sin to show up
[1:26:16] so you can relate to it in that manner
[1:26:18] that you needed a god of power
[1:26:20] to come and perform the miracle on your
[1:26:22] life but here we
[1:26:24] are and we think that well it was just
[1:26:26] it was just a little
[1:26:27] it was just a little thing for god to
[1:26:29] save you do you realize
[1:26:31] that the same blood that was shed on
[1:26:34] calvary
[1:26:34] that if you were the so if you were just
[1:26:37] a
[1:26:38] a person that had only maybe sinned or
[1:26:40] you never even drank
[1:26:42] or smoke or or doped or anything that it
[1:26:44] took the same amount of blood
[1:26:47] for you as the worst sinner there is out
[1:26:49] there in the world today
[1:26:52] so don't think yourself in some mirror
[1:26:54] some small miracle
[1:26:55] you are a miracle of almighty god
[1:26:58] and it costs the very life of god for
[1:27:01] your miracle
[1:27:08] hallelujah and my brother don't you be
[1:27:10] afraid
[1:27:11] i want you to hear me loud and clear my
[1:27:13] brother don't you be afraid to ask god
[1:27:16] anything you must demand god or ask god
[1:27:19] for anything that he promised
[1:27:21] for if i am introducing a god that's
[1:27:24] omnipotent
[1:27:25] and all-powerful and if i be the servant
[1:27:28] of god i must do the works of god
[1:27:30] and if i do the works of god i must be a
[1:27:32] man of god to bring these things to pass
[1:27:35] because he's demanding of me to produce
[1:27:38] the impossible
[1:27:39] i have to ask him i have to call upon
[1:27:42] him and stand there and say
[1:27:44] god you promised it
[1:27:49] notice what the prophet is saying i have
[1:27:52] to stand there and say
[1:27:54] god you promised it
[1:27:58] oh hallelujah there's so many people
[1:28:00] that want to separate william branham
[1:28:02] from being a part of the bride but do
[1:28:06] you realize that what happened in
[1:28:07] william branham's ministry
[1:28:09] happened in the bride's ministry
[1:28:13] well hallelujah that he was no more than
[1:28:15] just made out of the same elements
[1:28:17] just like you and i are but he had a
[1:28:20] calling on his life
[1:28:21] he was a prophet for the foundation of
[1:28:24] the world
[1:28:26] but he was called and elected to be the
[1:28:28] bride of jesus christ
[1:28:30] just like you were called just like you
[1:28:33] were elected
[1:28:34] just like you were predestinated so
[1:28:37] if an ordained anointed prophet of god
[1:28:40] would stand there and say
[1:28:42] i have to say god you promised it
[1:28:46] you're not separate in the manner of
[1:28:49] being a bride
[1:28:50] you have to stand there and say god you
[1:28:52] promised it
[1:28:54] god you said it god you're committed to
[1:28:57] your word
[1:28:58] and he said so to you every person you
[1:29:00] shall receive power
[1:29:02] after the holy spirit has come upon you
[1:29:04] after the holy spirit has come upon you
[1:29:07] after you're robed as a christian after
[1:29:09] your faith is set in christ
[1:29:11] then you shall receive power
[1:29:15] [Music]
[1:29:19] hallelujah then you shall receive power
[1:29:23] there
[1:29:24] you are hallelujah so we're looking at
[1:29:28] we see these things that god is no
[1:29:30] longer
[1:29:30] a vague god that we probed at or a
[1:29:33] distant god
[1:29:34] but he's a god that is nigh he's a god
[1:29:37] that is here
[1:29:39] i want you to say he's here and he's
[1:29:41] ready to reveal himself
[1:29:43] and manifest himself to the sons of men
[1:29:46] and i have to say that it is our desire
[1:29:49] it is our desire that every person
[1:29:52] every young person every middle-aged
[1:29:54] person every old person
[1:29:56] would experience this supernatural god
[1:29:59] of the bible
[1:30:00] we're only here and telling you these
[1:30:02] things and preaching to you these things
[1:30:05] to present to you the god of the bible
[1:30:09] hallelujah because i know what he's
[1:30:11] capable of
[1:30:14] i know that he can save the worst of
[1:30:16] sinners
[1:30:17] i know that he can deliver to the
[1:30:19] uttermost i know that he's able to
[1:30:22] reach down his nail scarred hands and
[1:30:24] pull you up out of the my reclaim
[1:30:26] i know what he's capable of and it is my
[1:30:29] desire that every young person i don't
[1:30:31] care how old they are
[1:30:33] i don't care how little they are is that
[1:30:35] every person
[1:30:36] would experience this supernatural god
[1:30:40] oh hallelujah if he did it for me he can
[1:30:43] do it for you
[1:30:45] and allow these things to become a
[1:30:47] reality to you
[1:30:51] you see he's been the miraculous working
[1:30:52] god all down through the ages and if he
[1:30:55] has been
[1:30:56] dealt through the ages and then come in
[1:30:58] here to the closing of all ages
[1:31:01] could he belittle himself and weaken his
[1:31:04] power and say there's no more to it
[1:31:07] absolutely not you see for him to remain
[1:31:10] to be god he's got to move the same
[1:31:13] he's got to act the same he's got to
[1:31:15] declare himself the same
[1:31:17] he's got to be the same
[1:31:20] are you with me if he delivered if he
[1:31:23] delivered from
[1:31:24] uh tuberculosis then if he delivered
[1:31:28] from varicose veins then he's got to be
[1:31:32] the same now
[1:31:34] he's got to declare himself the same if
[1:31:37] you come upon the same basis
[1:31:39] of faith as this one did and you come
[1:31:42] upon that
[1:31:43] you are setting in a spot for god to
[1:31:46] reveal himself to you
[1:31:51] brother branham and he his first healing
[1:31:53] campaign is saint louis missouri
[1:31:55] they held they held there and brother
[1:31:57] madam went first and he
[1:31:58] and he and he met uh brother dougherty
[1:32:00] at that time and
[1:32:01] on the first night of the meeting there
[1:32:04] were some 18 people that were caught up
[1:32:06] in the prayer line
[1:32:07] some miraculously completely whole but
[1:32:10] then on the next day brother random was
[1:32:12] asked to go
[1:32:13] to visit a home in granite city illinois
[1:32:16] and there was a lady who had been
[1:32:18] paralyzed in her right side
[1:32:20] for about a year and brother branham
[1:32:21] prayed for her
[1:32:23] and then commanded her to rise in the
[1:32:25] name of jesus christ
[1:32:27] and she obeyed and immediately raised
[1:32:29] her right hand above her head
[1:32:31] and stood alone then she walked back and
[1:32:33] forth across the room
[1:32:35] clapping her hands her voice which had
[1:32:37] been gone
[1:32:38] was restored and she was able to speak
[1:32:42] now what was he doing he was introducing
[1:32:45] a god
[1:32:46] of omnipotence he prayed the prayer of
[1:32:50] faith it was not prayer alone that did
[1:32:51] it but it was the prayer of faith
[1:32:54] and it was bringing god on the scene and
[1:32:56] that lady that had been laying there
[1:32:59] in that paralyzed condition got up out
[1:33:01] of that condition
[1:33:04] what was it showing it was showing to
[1:33:06] you and i that he is still
[1:33:08] the creator that when satan comes and
[1:33:12] perverts and pulls
[1:33:14] and drags down that god is the god of
[1:33:17] creation
[1:33:18] and that he is a god is of restoration
[1:33:21] and he brings it right back to its
[1:33:23] rightful position
[1:33:26] one of the first visions in brother
[1:33:28] branham's ministry was of that
[1:33:30] sis uh mrs darrell ohania who was a who
[1:33:33] was a crippled who was an invalid uh
[1:33:36] being crippled for 17 years
[1:33:38] and brother branham was directed by
[1:33:40] vision
[1:33:41] and and this is one of the first visions
[1:33:43] brother branham had after
[1:33:45] after this mr daryl hannah had heard
[1:33:48] about about mr uh mr murrell that had
[1:33:50] been delivered
[1:33:51] from the hospital and god completely
[1:33:53] came on the scene
[1:33:55] brother madam has led to this sister's
[1:33:57] house
[1:33:58] he goes up and knocks on the door and
[1:34:00] asks if there's a crippled lady there
[1:34:02] he goes up there knocks on the door and
[1:34:05] he sees
[1:34:05] miseras daryl had as laying there in
[1:34:08] that condition
[1:34:09] drawn up like a spider sitting there
[1:34:11] reading an armenian bible
[1:34:13] and he goes to her and says god has
[1:34:16] heard
[1:34:17] your prayer and as he prayed for her
[1:34:21] she got up out of that bed now crippled
[1:34:24] for 17 years
[1:34:27] she got up out of that bed and started
[1:34:29] shouting
[1:34:30] and the people in the neighborhood
[1:34:31] thought that she'd die and they ran over
[1:34:33] and checked on her
[1:34:34] and they seen that she was up walking
[1:34:36] and shouting and praising god
[1:34:38] they said well she's just excited and
[1:34:40] let her muscles down in her legs
[1:34:42] brother branham ran into her a few years
[1:34:44] later she said to brother
[1:34:46] branham said now brother madam you
[1:34:47] remember they told me that i was excited
[1:34:50] and i just let the muscles down in my
[1:34:52] legs she said well i have to tell you
[1:34:54] i'm still excited because i'm still
[1:34:58] welcome
[1:35:01] who was this none other than the god
[1:35:04] of omnipotence the god of all power the
[1:35:07] god
[1:35:08] that is more than able to do exceedingly
[1:35:10] abundantly
[1:35:11] above all that we could ever ask or
[1:35:14] think according
[1:35:15] to the power that worketh in us
[1:35:19] this same god was declaring himself as a
[1:35:22] shame
[1:35:26] hallelujah you remember when he's
[1:35:28] standing there in front of the crowds
[1:35:31] and the religions of the world in south
[1:35:33] africa after he had been entertained all
[1:35:35] day by the jews of the jesus of the
[1:35:37] sikhs and
[1:35:38] and the jains and and the religions of
[1:35:40] the world and there was a man that was
[1:35:42] led
[1:35:43] like a dog up to the platform had a
[1:35:46] chain around his neck walking
[1:35:48] and he said i brother branham said now
[1:35:50] he said i wouldn't have done this
[1:35:52] if i hadn't seen a vision he said but i
[1:35:54] stood there and i challenged the
[1:35:56] religions of the world
[1:35:58] if your god can heal him let him come
[1:36:02] let him come he said but i was able to
[1:36:04] look into that vision
[1:36:06] and see that man whole and see that he
[1:36:08] had gray hair
[1:36:09] in his sideburns he said so i could
[1:36:12] stand there and know
[1:36:13] that he was coming out of that condition
[1:36:15] i want to tell you
[1:36:17] that there has been a word spoke to you
[1:36:19] that you're coming out of that condition
[1:36:23] i'm coming out of it i'm walking out of
[1:36:26] it
[1:36:30] hallelujah
[1:36:34] and when they seen the omnipotent god
[1:36:37] show up
[1:36:38] brother branham said it was like a dust
[1:36:40] cloud taking place
[1:36:41] when 30 000 raw heathens accepted the
[1:36:44] lord jesus christ
[1:36:45] they broke their idols and created a
[1:36:48] dutch cloud
[1:36:49] of all of those idols that they had been
[1:36:51] packing around
[1:36:52] but this god that sold up on that day
[1:36:55] they didn't have to pack him around
[1:36:57] he was the god that would pack them
[1:36:59] around
[1:37:00] [Applause]
[1:37:03] hallelujah what was this showing to you
[1:37:06] as a body of believers
[1:37:07] that he's with you
[1:37:10] he's with you he's not leaving you he's
[1:37:13] not
[1:37:13] changing hallelujah
[1:37:18] so if i could just see a vision brother
[1:37:21] branham said that if you open up your
[1:37:23] bible
[1:37:23] every day you have seen a vision he told
[1:37:26] us that the vision don't heal you
[1:37:29] but it is simply to declare and
[1:37:31] vindicate the presence
[1:37:33] of almighty god
[1:37:37] hallelujah turn me to joshua chapter one
[1:37:44] have you got your notes
[1:37:47] have you got your notes i'm giving you
[1:37:49] some bombs tonight
[1:37:53] let's stick them on that bomb and send
[1:37:55] it back over
[1:37:57] joshua chapter one and verse one now
[1:38:00] after the death of moses
[1:38:02] the servant of the lord it came to pass
[1:38:04] that the lord spake unto joshua
[1:38:06] the son of moses minister
[1:38:09] saying moses my servant is dead now
[1:38:12] therefore
[1:38:13] arise and go over this jordan thou and
[1:38:15] all this people into the land which i do
[1:38:17] give
[1:38:18] to them notice which i do give to them
[1:38:21] even to the children of israel
[1:38:23] every place that the soul of your foot
[1:38:25] shall tread upon
[1:38:26] that have i given unto you as i said
[1:38:28] unto moses
[1:38:29] from the wilderness and this lebanon
[1:38:31] even unto the great river euphrates
[1:38:34] all the land of the hittites and under
[1:38:37] the great sea toward the going down of
[1:38:39] the sun
[1:38:40] shall be your coast now there shall not
[1:38:43] any man
[1:38:44] be able to stand before thee all the
[1:38:47] days of thy life
[1:38:48] as i was with moses so i
[1:38:53] so i will be with thee i will not fail
[1:38:58] thee nor forsake thee be strong and of a
[1:39:01] good courage
[1:39:02] for under this people thou shalt divide
[1:39:04] an inheritance
[1:39:05] for the land at which i swear unto their
[1:39:08] fathers to give them
[1:39:10] only be thou strong and very courageous
[1:39:13] that thou mayest observe to do according
[1:39:16] to all the law which moses my servant
[1:39:18] commanded thee
[1:39:20] turn not from it to the right or to the
[1:39:21] left that thou mayest prosper
[1:39:24] wither thou goest wither so ever thou
[1:39:26] goest
[1:39:27] this book of the law shall not depart
[1:39:29] out of the mouth now he's not saying to
[1:39:31] him
[1:39:31] that you should put your hand over your
[1:39:33] mouth and not speak it
[1:39:34] but he is telling him that you should
[1:39:37] repeat these things that these things
[1:39:39] should be
[1:39:39] coming out of your mouth that these
[1:39:41] things ought to be acquainted with you
[1:39:43] and when you're in your downtime as a
[1:39:45] businessman
[1:39:46] you need to be reading these things you
[1:39:48] need to be studying these things
[1:39:49] go over these things eat these things
[1:39:54] observe what moses said observe the law
[1:39:58] but thou shalt meditate in that word
[1:40:00] meditate in the hebrew
[1:40:01] means to speak again but thou shalt
[1:40:05] meditate therein day and night that thou
[1:40:08] mayest observe to do according
[1:40:10] to all that is written therein
[1:40:14] that's huge that thou mayest observe to
[1:40:17] do
[1:40:17] according all that is written therein
[1:40:20] for then thou shall make thy way
[1:40:22] prosperous
[1:40:23] then thou shalt have a good success
[1:40:26] have not i
[1:40:29] who i love it when god talks to us have
[1:40:32] not i
[1:40:32] commanded thee be strong
[1:40:36] be strong and of a good courage be not
[1:40:40] afraid
[1:40:40] neither be thou dismayed for the lord
[1:40:43] thy god is with thee
[1:40:45] wither so ever thou goest
[1:40:50] be strong and of a good courage you can
[1:40:52] look over in the bible in proverbs 28 i
[1:40:54] believe
[1:40:55] that it says that the wicketh runeth
[1:40:57] with the wicked flee when no man
[1:40:59] pursueth
[1:41:01] but the righteous are as bold as a lion
[1:41:05] they're as bold as a lion they're not
[1:41:07] afraid to go out there in their own
[1:41:09] when they're not protected when they're
[1:41:12] all alone
[1:41:13] they're not afraid to go out there so a
[1:41:16] christian
[1:41:16] is to be bold now the wicked which we
[1:41:20] know is a sinner
[1:41:21] we realize that a sinner that there is
[1:41:24] an element of fear that is attached with
[1:41:26] a sinner
[1:41:26] because a sinner has sinned they've got
[1:41:28] unbelief in their life
[1:41:30] and if you walk in here with sin on your
[1:41:32] life there is a certain amount of fear
[1:41:34] that is attached to you because you
[1:41:36] don't want that exposed
[1:41:38] you don't want that called out but the
[1:41:41] righteous
[1:41:41] is not afraid of that thing being
[1:41:43] exposed because he's already brought it
[1:41:45] under the blood
[1:41:46] so he can walk out there right in the
[1:41:48] face of the enemy
[1:41:49] and say i'm as bold as a lion
[1:41:53] i know where i'm standing at i know in
[1:41:56] whom i have believed
[1:41:59] and here god is telling joshua that this
[1:42:02] is your commission to go and take the
[1:42:05] book
[1:42:07] go into this land get that land
[1:42:10] i command you to do it that i will be
[1:42:12] with thee wheresoever thou
[1:42:14] goest is that not what the angel told
[1:42:18] our prophet in this day
[1:42:20] don't you fear to go anywhere for the
[1:42:22] never failing presence of jesus christ
[1:42:25] is with you whether so ever thou that
[1:42:27] same angel
[1:42:30] the same angel is there when you don't
[1:42:32] feel him the same angel is there
[1:42:34] when you're afraid the same angel is
[1:42:37] there when you're in your humanity
[1:42:38] the same angel is there when you feel
[1:42:41] like a son of god
[1:42:42] he's not leaving you
[1:42:46] hallelujah
[1:42:49] our duty is to speak that word
[1:42:53] hallelujah i want to take some pressure
[1:42:55] off of you tonight because i feel that
[1:42:57] pressure and i feel that tension
[1:43:00] that there are people that sit here or
[1:43:03] maybe don't sit here or maybe
[1:43:04] maybe it's in the back of your mind or
[1:43:07] maybe it's on those on the way to the
[1:43:09] internet
[1:43:10] but i want to take some pressure off of
[1:43:12] you so you don't have to live up to this
[1:43:15] but i want to take this off of you that
[1:43:16] we're not trying to produce
[1:43:18] another william branham we're not trying
[1:43:22] to produce another william branham that
[1:43:23] would stand behind the pulpit
[1:43:25] and call out diseases and call out 40 40
[1:43:28] things in a person's life i see you're
[1:43:30] here
[1:43:31] i see you're from the northland you're
[1:43:32] coming through a wheat field i see that
[1:43:34] you flew from here
[1:43:35] i see a doctor he's he's heavyset and
[1:43:37] got he's got these ring glasses
[1:43:40] we're not trying to produce another
[1:43:41] william branham that could stand there
[1:43:43] and call out demons and see black
[1:43:45] streets running back and forth
[1:43:47] but we are here simply to observe the
[1:43:50] word of this law
[1:43:51] and to speak that word and it is not
[1:43:54] hallelujah
[1:43:55] it is not the life of william branham
[1:43:57] that produced the works
[1:43:59] it's the life of jesus christ that
[1:44:01] produced the works of almighty god
[1:44:09] brother burnham was a vindicated prophet
[1:44:12] had the signs
[1:44:13] and he was completely identified and
[1:44:15] vindicated
[1:44:16] and showed forth and identified himself
[1:44:19] in the scripture as malachi 4.
[1:44:22] but this word this word that's been
[1:44:25] delivered to you
[1:44:26] is the word that vindicates you
[1:44:32] whoa ain't that something it took off
[1:44:33] all the pressure i don't have
[1:44:35] to identify myself but the word of the
[1:44:38] hour
[1:44:39] identifies me with this message
[1:44:42] with this god with this power
[1:44:48] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:44:51] but i love i love what the lord speaks
[1:44:54] to joshua
[1:44:55] he says my servant moses is dead
[1:44:58] but i'm still here
[1:45:02] come on somebody william branham's dead
[1:45:06] but the i am is still here
[1:45:10] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:45:16] it's an amazing thing to know this
[1:45:18] evening and i don't have to act like
[1:45:19] brother wrong
[1:45:20] that i don't have to act like brother
[1:45:22] donny reagan or brother tim pruitt
[1:45:24] the great mature men of god that stand
[1:45:26] there in their calling and in their
[1:45:28] anointing
[1:45:28] and i don't have to produce the works
[1:45:31] like brother donnie like brother ron
[1:45:33] like brother tim like brother biscuit
[1:45:35] but all i'm called to do
[1:45:37] is stand in my calling and i am called
[1:45:40] to stand here
[1:45:41] and god is the one that'll produce the
[1:45:43] works if he wants to produce miracles
[1:45:46] tonight
[1:45:46] he's the god that will do just that
[1:45:53] hallelujah joshua was not commissioned
[1:45:57] to stand
[1:45:58] in front of pharaoh and stretch his rod
[1:46:00] out and he'd become a snake
[1:46:01] and he'd become a serpent but his
[1:46:04] commission
[1:46:05] was simply to carry the children of
[1:46:07] israel
[1:46:08] over onto the promised land
[1:46:12] he didn't have to stand there and call
[1:46:14] out pharaoh and
[1:46:15] tell the locust to go back and the winds
[1:46:18] of god come down
[1:46:19] and send them back to the red sea he
[1:46:21] didn't have to stand out there and
[1:46:23] stretch out his rod
[1:46:24] and he command the sea to go to its
[1:46:26] place and hold in that spot
[1:46:29] but he was simply to speak what the word
[1:46:32] said speak
[1:46:34] hallelujah hallelujah it was not when
[1:46:38] joshua stood there at the jordan river
[1:46:40] it was not the rod but it was him taking
[1:46:44] what the lord told him to do it was him
[1:46:47] taking that word
[1:46:48] he didn't stretch a rod out there in
[1:46:50] joshua chapter
[1:46:51] chapter 2 or chapter 4 i forget the
[1:46:53] chapter just now
[1:46:55] it was not the rod that was standing
[1:46:56] there but he said
[1:46:58] when the ark of the covenant hits that
[1:47:02] water
[1:47:03] you see it was packed on the levite
[1:47:05] shoulder and when the ark hit the water
[1:47:07] the water separated from hither to the
[1:47:09] other
[1:47:11] what was it showing to you that the same
[1:47:14] god
[1:47:14] that was with moses what's with joshua
[1:47:19] hallelujah you don't have to act like me
[1:47:22] you don't have to act like brother
[1:47:23] branham
[1:47:24] you just speak the word
[1:47:27] that's nothing but the truth
[1:47:30] [Applause]
[1:47:33] oh give him praise in the house of god
[1:47:39] hallelujah and joshua stood there under
[1:47:42] that condition
[1:47:43] under that commission and he stood there
[1:47:45] and what did the children of israel do
[1:47:47] they followed that word right on through
[1:47:53] hallelujah it was at the jordan river we
[1:47:56] know what the jordan river typifies to
[1:47:58] us
[1:47:59] it was at the jordan river that god
[1:48:01] proved that he was still
[1:48:03] with joshua as he was with moses
[1:48:06] it was at the jordan river when elisha
[1:48:09] walked down there
[1:48:10] and he says where be the god of elijah
[1:48:14] and god proved that he was still god
[1:48:16] with elisha
[1:48:17] he was at the jordan river when john the
[1:48:20] baptist was baptized in there
[1:48:22] and he said behold the lamb of god which
[1:48:24] takes away the sin of the world
[1:48:26] god was proving that he was in humanity
[1:48:30] and that you could take on divinity and
[1:48:32] when you walked down to the jordan river
[1:48:34] of death
[1:48:35] it was god proving that i am i am i am
[1:48:39] inside of you
[1:48:44] hallelujah there's power in that jordan
[1:48:47] river
[1:48:48] and you're standing at a spot just now
[1:48:51] for him to reveal himself to you and
[1:48:54] declare that he's god and there is none
[1:48:56] like him
[1:48:59] you see satan don't mind you coming to
[1:49:00] church
[1:49:02] satan don't mind you singing satan don't
[1:49:04] mind you getting emotional
[1:49:06] satan don't even mind you joining the
[1:49:08] choir satan don't even mind you speaking
[1:49:10] in tongues and hollering and jumping and
[1:49:12] shouting and
[1:49:13] acting like a pentecostal goddard satan
[1:49:16] don't mind he don't mind those things
[1:49:18] but when you start going and receiving
[1:49:20] the word of this hour
[1:49:22] that will whip the devil any time any
[1:49:24] place under any circumstance
[1:49:26] that's when satan gets all bothered he
[1:49:28] gets all tore up and all hails turn
[1:49:30] loose
[1:49:31] when you start receiving this word that
[1:49:33] is an omnipotent word
[1:49:35] that would do the same thing that he did
[1:49:37] then 2 000 years ago
[1:49:39] that's when satan gets messed up
[1:49:42] he don't even know which way to go he's
[1:49:44] running around like a
[1:49:45] like a dog with his tail tucked he's
[1:49:47] running around
[1:49:48] wondering how fast i can get back down
[1:49:50] to hell when somebody starts believing
[1:49:53] thus saith the lord satan gets scared
[1:49:56] [Applause]
[1:49:56] [Music]
[1:50:02] hallelujah you see satan would try his
[1:50:05] best to keep the children of israel from
[1:50:07] going in
[1:50:08] with false reports and rumors and
[1:50:10] negativity and tell them that you
[1:50:11] couldn't make it that you ain't strong
[1:50:13] enough
[1:50:14] they chain able that you can't overtake
[1:50:16] it
[1:50:17] but there was a believer there was a
[1:50:20] believer by the name of caleb that said
[1:50:21] we're more than able
[1:50:23] i wonder if there's a believer in the
[1:50:24] house of god tonight that would say that
[1:50:27] i
[1:50:27] am here to show that that is a god
[1:50:31] that is more than able to take us over
[1:50:33] into that land
[1:50:35] it's a good land it's a holy ghost land
[1:50:39] that will bring up a positive report of
[1:50:41] this land that this holy ghost won't
[1:50:43] kill you but this holy ghost to keep you
[1:50:46] you ain't got to be scared of this holy
[1:50:47] ghost it's enough fire on the inside of
[1:50:50] it
[1:50:50] that it'll come and it'll quench all of
[1:50:52] your sin and drive out all of your sin
[1:50:55] it's got so much power in that fire that
[1:50:58] it won't hurt you when it comes on the
[1:50:59] inside
[1:51:00] but let that fire turn loose on hell one
[1:51:02] time
[1:51:04] it'll drive demons right back to their
[1:51:07] spot but that same holy ghost is living
[1:51:09] on the inside of you
[1:51:10] i want to tell you children don't you be
[1:51:12] afraid of it you just let him come on in
[1:51:16] if your parents are afraid to open up a
[1:51:17] door open up a window
[1:51:19] let him in if they don't want to hear
[1:51:22] the tapes play
[1:51:23] you go up an attic and you let them
[1:51:25] tapes play
[1:51:29] if they don't want to see you praying
