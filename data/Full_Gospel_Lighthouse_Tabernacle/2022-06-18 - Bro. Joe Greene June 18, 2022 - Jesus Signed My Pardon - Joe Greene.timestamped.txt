[44:45] thoughts
[44:46] and it just it just wasn't settling

[45:03] songs those last courses and i said
[45:05] thank you lord
[45:06] that's where we need to go so tonight
[45:09] i'm going to preach on jesus signed
[45:12] my pardon
[45:13] amen i know that's simple but that's all
[45:16] right i believe our god hides and
[45:18] reveals himself in simplicity this
[45:20] evening amen so as you're finding your
[45:23] place in the book of romans chapter 8
[45:25] tonight
[45:26] i just like to thank you for
[45:29] your prayers for my sister mary and her
[45:32] family last weekend we buried her
[45:34] husband of almost 50 years
[45:37] and this is actually the second husband
[45:39] that she lost her first
[45:41] husband died at the ripe young age of 27
[45:44] with uh
[45:46] colon cancer and i had a terrible death
[45:49] but you know whenever he was dying he
[45:51] was wading up down the streets of or up
[45:53] the riverbank looking for a shallow
[45:55] place to cross
[45:56] he said i want to die i know i'm going
[45:58] to but i'm just waiting for that right
[46:01] spot to cross over and he went home to
[46:03] be with the lord so i
[46:05] the brother dean here last week just
[46:07] unexpectedly
[46:08] uh picture of health for the most part
[46:11] and not really sick of any sort but it
[46:14] just goes to show you when your number
[46:15] is up

[46:19] brother ernie then it's your time amen
[46:22] so it behooves you and i to make sure
[46:24] that we're ready for that hour because

[46:27] in such an hour when the son of man
[46:29] cometh or when he calls us home you know
[46:31] a few years ago we were in the
[46:33] philippines and i spoke at a meeting
[46:35] there and the theme of the meeting was
[46:37] rapture ready
[46:39] and i responded to that i said if you
[46:41] ain't ready to die and meet god tonight
[46:43] you ain't ready for a rapture
[46:45] amen so i i believe tonight that we as a
[46:48] people
[46:49] of god we want to be ready we want to be
[46:51] prepared because we know that the lord
[46:54] is coming for us one way or the other

[48:39] think the the the number then was
[48:41] something over 500 different churches
[48:43] that we've helped to build and uh you
[48:45] know it's it's a it's a wonderful thing
[48:47] to give them a book to give them a track
[48:49] to lead them to the lord but if they
[48:51] don't have a place to come together to
[48:52] fellowship like you have here and it
[48:54] won't be
[48:56] it won't be as nice as this it may just
[48:58] be a a brick
[49:00] hut or a bad i know we were there the
[49:03] philippines a few years ago and the
[49:04] brother was needing to put some walls on
[49:06] his church
[49:07] so i asked him how much it would cost
[49:09] and uh the figure came back a hundred
[49:11] and twenty dollars
[49:13] to put walls around the church brother
[49:15] vernon it's just a bamboo sheeting you
[49:18] know woven together bamboo strips but

[55:37] just as pure as god is by the shed blood
[55:41] of jesus christ and not amen he said
[55:44] what shall we then say to these things
[55:48] if god before us
[55:50] who
[55:51] can be against us i want to ask you
[55:53] tonight who can be against the bride of
[55:56] jesus christ who can be against a blood

[56:13] opposing side comes up and they say well
[56:15] he did this and he did that and he did
[56:17] that i want you to understand when the
[56:19] devil comes accusing you this evening
[56:21] amen when he brings it before the great
[56:23] judge of almighty uh almighty god amen
[56:26] god says that's been stricken from the

[56:34] done away why because i have signed his
[56:38] pardon amen and he can now go free now
[56:42] that word pardon this evening if we look
[56:44] at it it means release from your guilt
[56:49] amen i want you to understand tonight
[56:51] amen you have been released from your
[56:54] guilt you're no longer guilty
[56:59] amen you're no longer guilty this
[57:02] evening you have been set free tonight
[57:05] amen and we're going to get to it in a
[57:07] little bit but let me just go ahead amen
[57:09] you remember the story brother branham
[57:10] told about the the soldier that ran in
[57:12] the heat of battle and and you know his
[57:14] friend came to abraham lincoln saw him
[57:16] in a restaurant or whatever and asked
[57:18] brother um president lincoln rather for
[57:21] a pardon amen he just took a napkin
[57:24] turned it over and wrote on there amen i
[57:26] abraham lincoln do hereby pardon
[57:28] whatever his name was and the friend
[57:30] took it back to the prison and the guy
[57:32] would not accept it as a pardon i want
[57:34] you to understand if you don't accept
[57:37] that jesus has signed your pardon it
[57:39] will do you no good this evening but if
[57:42] you recognize hey i am free i have been
[57:45] delivered amen there's a story told
[57:48] about amen i believe brother branham
[57:50] mentions it about a guy that's sitting
[57:52] in an electric chair he's got the the
[57:54] thing on his head he's got a band on his
[57:56] arm a band on his leg amen and then all
[58:00] of a sudden here comes somebody busting
[58:02] in the door amen and declares i've got a
[58:04] pardon for him i've got a pardon for him
[58:07] brother branham said that man is just
[58:09] just as free as if he was walking the
[58:11] street because the pardon has been
[58:14] signed amen and his deliverance has been
[58:17] hand delivered i want you to understand
[58:19] tonight amen your pardon has been hand
[58:22] delivered by god himself he gave his
[58:26] only begotten son that whosoever
[58:28] believeth on him shall not perish but
[58:30] should have everlasting life this
[58:33] evening amen now we look and we read
[58:36] romans 8 28 to 32 from the lexum bible
[58:41] and it says and we know that all things
[58:43] work together for good to those who love
[58:44] god toward those who are called
[58:46] according to his purpose because god
[58:50] because those whom he foreknew he also
[58:52] predestinated to be conformed to the
[58:54] image of his son so that he should be
[58:56] the first one among many brothers and
[58:58] those whom he predestinated amen these
[59:02] he also called and justified and these
[59:05] he also glorified what then shall we say
[59:08] about these things if god be for us who
[59:12] can be against us indeed he did not
[59:14] spare his own son but gave him up for a
[59:17] soul how will he not also together with
[59:20] him freely give us all things amen so
[59:24] god has given us not only our salvation
[59:27] but he's given us our healing he's given
[59:29] us our deliverance he's given us our
[59:31] victory he's given us our joy he's given
[59:34] us our peace he's given us everything
[59:37] that we have need of in this christian
[59:39] experience tonight and he's given it to
[59:42] us freely this evening amen and it's
[59:44] there for us to take advantage of but
[59:47] we've got to take advantage of it and
[59:50] not just let it lay on the shelf and say
[59:52] well it looks good or it sounds good
[59:54] amen you remember brother man i'm
[59:55] talking about the old colored man in the
[59:58] museum there looking in the glass case
[1:00:00] amen looking at that dress that was
[1:00:02] there amen and brother man i'm asking
[1:00:04] dad what what's this all about why are
[1:00:07] you so tore up he said you see that
[1:00:09] little garment there amen you see that
[1:00:11] red spot said that's the blood of
[1:00:13] abraham lincoln well i hear tonight amen
[1:00:16] i'm not here to share abraham lincoln's
[1:00:18] blood but i'm here to tell you about the
[1:00:20] blood of jesus christ amen that cleansed
[1:00:23] me and saved me from my sins and i he
[1:00:26] made a way that i could be called a son
[1:00:29] of god that i could be delivered in this
[1:00:32] hour and recognized by the shannon amen
[1:00:34] that i am no longer guilty i'm no longer
[1:00:37] a slave to sin i'm no longer bound by
[1:00:40] chains of doubt and confusion and
[1:00:43] hardship and trouble jesus signed my
[1:00:46] pardon
[1:00:48] amen
[1:00:50] that word predestinated means to know
[1:00:53] beforehand
[1:00:54] to know previously
[1:00:57] to take into account
[1:00:59] or specially consider
[1:01:01] beforehand do you realize before the
[1:01:04] foundation of the world brother gabriel
[1:01:06] god specially considered you
[1:01:10] he looked down through the eons of time
[1:01:13] amen and he looked over the banister of
[1:01:15] eternity and he looked down here on a
[1:01:17] saturday night in the month of june amen
[1:01:20] right before father's day and he
[1:01:22] recognized amen i am that boy's father
[1:01:27] and he is going to produce
[1:01:28] characteristics just like me
[1:01:30] he's going to produce a seed amen that
[1:01:33] comes from me his life is going to be a
[1:01:35] testimony of my grace and of my mercy
[1:01:38] and of my love oh let me tell you i
[1:01:40] could go down the aisle tonight and pick
[1:01:42] every one of us amen god saw you before
[1:01:45] the foundation of the world and he knew
[1:01:48] you this evening and i want to tell you
[1:01:50] if god is for me it doesn't matter what
[1:01:53] kind of pawn shop the devil sells me in
[1:01:55] it doesn't matter what kind of trap he
[1:01:57] gets me in it doesn't matter how low i
[1:02:00] go or how low i get drugged down thank
[1:02:03] god his grace is vision and his mercy is
[1:02:07] everlasting amen his hand amen reaches
[1:02:10] further down than you or i could reach
[1:02:13] up tonight
[1:02:14] [Applause]
[1:02:19] predestinate also means
[1:02:21] to grant prior acknowledgement
[1:02:24] or recognition to someone
[1:02:27] so god before the foundation of the
[1:02:29] world he granted you
[1:02:32] prior recognition
[1:02:34] prior acknowledgement
[1:02:36] amen he knew you
[1:02:38] always sing a song sometime he knew me
[1:02:42] yet he loved me
[1:02:44] amen when he was on the cross i was on
[1:02:47] his mind i'm the reason that he went to
[1:02:49] the cross
[1:02:50] i'm the reason that he carried it up the
[1:02:52] hill i'm the reason that he had the
[1:02:54] stripes upon his back i'm the reason
[1:02:57] that he was born
[1:03:01] come on now help me preach
[1:03:03] i'm the reason this evening amen that he
[1:03:05] gave his life
[1:03:07] i'm the reason that he paid the price
[1:03:10] i'm the reason that he became sin who
[1:03:12] knew no sin that we might become the
[1:03:15] righteousness of god in him you know so
[1:03:17] many people when it comes time for
[1:03:19] communion they have such a hard time
[1:03:22] understanding that he has made us meet
[1:03:27] in other words we didn't do it ourselves
[1:03:29] we didn't clean ourself up we didn't
[1:03:31] save ourselves he has made us meet he
[1:03:34] brother vernon has made us worthy
[1:03:36] tonight amen it's not by our
[1:03:38] righteousness it's by his righteousness
[1:03:41] this evening i know this is simple you
[1:03:43] may think amen it's not a message
[1:03:45] message but i want to tell you what's
[1:03:47] the greatest message you ever heard amen
[1:03:50] that jesus christ loved the world that
[1:03:52] he gave his only begotten son that
[1:03:54] whosoever believeth on him should not
[1:03:57] perish but have everlasting life and i'm
[1:04:00] so glad that he came this evening i'm so
[1:04:03] glad amen that he took upon himself a
[1:04:06] robe of flesh that i might become the

[1:14:32] us
[1:14:33] and from jesus christ who is the
[1:14:35] faithful witness
[1:14:37] and the first begotten of the dead and
[1:14:39] the prince of the kings of the earth
[1:14:41] unto him that loved us
[1:14:43] and washed us from our sins in his own
[1:14:47] blood now i want you to understand
[1:14:48] tonight it wasn't the blood of a jew
[1:14:51] it wasn't the blood of a greek or a
[1:14:53] gentile

[1:14:59] created blood spotless sinless it had no
[1:15:03] sin in it amen it wasn't it wasn't
[1:15:07] designed amen by the act of sinful uh
[1:15:12] lust or sinful act this evening it was a
[1:15:14] spoken word gene cell blood cell of god
[1:15:18] that god spoke and planted in the womb
[1:15:21] of mary and it brought forth the son of
[1:15:24] god a man who knew no sin
[1:15:29] he didn't have no sin brother randall if
[1:15:31] he was a sinner amen and had sin in
[1:15:35] himself amen then you and i have no hope
[1:15:38] this evening
[1:15:39] but because he was sinless he was
[1:15:42] spotless god himself testified when he
[1:15:45] was there being baptized by john a voice
[1:15:47] out of heaven said behold this is my
[1:15:50] beloved son in whom i am pleased to
[1:15:52] dwell or well please amen god testified
[1:15:56] this is the perfect sacrifice his blood
[1:15:59] amen will cover not just cover but
[1:16:02] annihilate the sins of men
[1:16:07] you know whenever
[1:16:08] the children of israel brought their
[1:16:10] sacrifice
[1:16:11] they laid their hands on the head of
[1:16:13] that sacrifice and the priest took a
[1:16:15] knife or a stone or whatever he had and
[1:16:18] slit the throat the the worshiper had
[1:16:20] his hands on it as the blood dripped out
[1:16:23] of that little lambs or turtle of his
[1:16:25] throat amen and he identified with that
[1:16:28] lamb i want you to understand tonight
[1:16:30] amen i have a lamb that i identify with
[1:16:33] and his name brother demi is jesus
[1:16:36] christ and his blood was shed for me and
[1:16:39] not only amen this blood that was shed
[1:16:42] by the priest amen for the worshiper

[1:16:53] it's no longer remembered against me
[1:16:56] amen the record is clean the record is
[1:16:59] wide i am as pure as the driven snow

[1:17:06] pardon i have received amen what god has
[1:17:10] done for me tonight he has made me free
[1:17:13] this evening

[1:17:20] free
[1:17:21] is free indeed
[1:17:24] amen
[1:17:28] brother bottom tells us in the message
[1:17:29] the faith
[1:17:31] that was once delivered to the saints
[1:17:34] he said if you were sitting in prison we
[1:17:36] referred to this
[1:17:38] set to die
[1:17:40] nine o'clock in the morning
[1:17:42] they had all your hair shaved off
[1:17:44] and a big helmet on and your sleeve on
[1:17:46] the left side rolled up
[1:17:48] a big brass band around it over your
[1:17:51] right leg
[1:17:52] a man was standing with a switch in his
[1:17:54] hand
[1:17:55] getting ready
[1:17:57] to press the button
[1:17:59] and
[1:18:00] and he
[1:18:01] somebody run through the door don't do
[1:18:03] it don't do it don't do it just in the
[1:18:05] nick of time
[1:18:07] amen and he said i've got a pardon from
[1:18:09] the governor that man is just as free
[1:18:12] listen you hear brother madam on the
[1:18:14] tape
[1:18:15] and someone comes before him and they're
[1:18:16] not a christian brother ron and he asked
[1:18:18] them would you like to be a christian
[1:18:21] and they said yes i would
[1:18:23] he said all right sister or all right
[1:18:25] brother he said look he's already called
[1:18:27] you a brother
[1:18:30] it don't take in eternity but andrew
[1:18:33] all you got to do is accept it
[1:18:36] when the offer is made
[1:18:38] accept it receive it how many times do
[1:18:40] we hear brother branham say just just
[1:18:42] lift your hand now that's an act of
[1:18:44] faith that shows that you believe it
[1:18:46] that shows that you accept it sister
[1:18:48] anna amen
[1:18:49] and when you when you do that then it
[1:18:52] you can just say if you hold that faith
[1:18:54] in your heart it's just as well done as
[1:18:56] it ever will be
[1:19:02] brother bynum
[1:19:03] goes on in that quote he says in every
[1:19:05] man and woman here tonight who can
[1:19:07] recognize that this is the faith that
[1:19:10] we're preaching the faith that you
[1:19:12] believed for years that was delivered to
[1:19:14] the saints first that jesus came to
[1:19:17] pardon you and taken you out of your
[1:19:18] prison cells of sickness and sin your
[1:19:21] pardon is freely signed christ signed it
[1:19:24] with his own blood for he was wounded
[1:19:26] for our transgressions with his stripes
[1:19:28] we're healed he said you're free where's
[1:19:31] he signed it the book says so two
[1:19:32] thousand years ago not one word has ever
[1:19:35] failed after a hundred billion years
[1:19:37] roll on she will never still never fail
[1:19:40] god once speaks it he can't take it back
[1:19:43] i can speak and take it back so can you
[1:19:45] but once he speaks it it is settled
[1:19:49] forever i want you to understand amen
[1:19:51] when he said father forgive them for
[1:19:54] they know not what they do amen those
[1:19:56] men that crucified him those standing
[1:19:58] around their sins were forgiven just as
[1:20:00] much as yours is
[1:20:03] because he forgave them
[1:20:06] whether they accepted it whether they
[1:20:08] walked on in salvation or not i don't
[1:20:10] know amen but they were forgiven this
[1:20:12] evening amen jesus signed your pardon he
[1:20:16] made a way for you this evening
[1:20:19] i know this is simple it's okay
[1:20:26] it's the greatest message you'll ever
[1:20:28] hear if you need it
[1:20:34] you know somebody offered a millionaire
[1:20:37] a million dollars
[1:20:38] he said well i don't really need it i've
[1:20:40] got plenty
[1:20:41] you know it wouldn't do no good
[1:20:44] he didn't accept it but if you accept
[1:20:47] salvation
[1:20:48] oh my it'll change your life tonight
[1:20:50] amen
[1:20:51] romans 5 6-10 for when we were yet
[1:20:54] without strength
[1:20:55] in due time christ died for the ungodly
[1:20:59] for scarcely for a righteous man will
[1:21:00] one die yet per venture for a good man
[1:21:03] would some even dare to die but god
[1:21:05] commendeth his love toward us
[1:21:08] in that while we were yet sinners
[1:21:11] christ died for us
[1:21:13] much more than being now justified by
[1:21:16] his blood we shall be saved from wrath
[1:21:19] through him amen for if when we were
[1:21:21] enemies we were reconciled to god by the
[1:21:24] death of his son much more being
[1:21:25] reconciled we shall be saved
[1:21:28] by his life oh don't you realize tonight
[1:21:31] amen he has reconciled us oh my he has
[1:21:34] brought us back into a right
[1:21:36] relationship with him amen and now amen
[1:21:39] through that amen we shall be saved by
[1:21:42] his life this evening
[1:21:44] amen
[1:21:46] matthew 3 17 speaks about a voice from
[1:21:49] heaven this is my beloved son we quoted
[1:21:51] it earlier in whom i am well pleased
[1:21:54] second corinthians 5 21 for he hath made
[1:21:57] him to be sin for us

[1:22:02] the righteousness of god in him amen oh
[1:22:06] i tell you this evening amen so many
[1:22:09] times we look and we we look at ourself
[1:22:11] listen don't look at yourself
[1:22:16] that worshiper he identified with that
[1:22:18] lamb he laid his hands on it amen he
[1:22:21] recognized that that lamb was dying in
[1:22:24] his place amen but that lamb could not
[1:22:28] take away his desire to continue to sin
[1:22:32] but i'm here to tell you tonight my lamb
[1:22:35] amen not only did he shed his blood for
[1:22:37] me but he took away the desire for sin
[1:22:40] amen i'm no longer bound by the lustful
[1:22:43] desires i'm no longer bound by sin i'm
[1:22:46] no longer bound by ideas amen that would
[1:22:49] lead me astray thank god i have been set
[1:22:52] free jesus signed my pardon this evening
[1:23:01] he became sin who knew no sin
[1:23:04] didn't say he sinned
[1:23:06] he became sin
[1:23:08] who knew no sin that i might become the

[1:39:01] you plant your corn in the garden or
[1:39:03] your flower bulbs
[1:39:06] you don't expect it to stay there
[1:39:08] you expect after a certain period of
[1:39:10] time there's a little shoot going to
[1:39:12] come up out of the ground and the next
[1:39:14] thing you know it's going to put forth
[1:39:15] some leaves and then some buds and then
[1:39:16] there's going to be some beautiful
[1:39:17] flowers some corn or some green beans or
[1:39:19] whatever amen you are expecting a return
[1:39:23] because you're just planting it you
[1:39:26] didn't bury it for it to stay there
[1:39:29] amen but it's got to rot it's got to die
[1:39:32] but because it does that it shows that
[1:39:34] there's life in it and it's going to
[1:39:35] come forth again
[1:39:38] amen
[1:39:40] let me move on
[1:39:46] brother adelman said in the message
[1:39:48] faith that was once delivered to the
[1:39:49] saints
[1:39:50] as we close this evening musicians you
[1:39:52] can come
[1:39:55] and every man or woman
[1:39:58] in here tonight that can recognize
[1:40:01] that this is the faith
[1:40:03] that we are preaching
[1:40:06] the faith that you believed for years
[1:40:09] that was delivered to the saints first
[1:40:12] that jesus come to pardon you and taken
[1:40:15] you out of your prison cells of sickness
[1:40:17] and sin
[1:40:18] your pardon is freely signed
[1:40:22] christ signed it with his own
[1:40:25] blood
[1:40:27] for he was wounded for our
[1:40:28] transgressions with his stripes we
[1:40:31] were
[1:40:32] healed
[1:40:33] already done past tense you're free
[1:40:36] where does he sign it the book says so
[1:40:38] two thousand years ago and not one word
[1:40:41] has ever failed
[1:40:42] and after a hundred billion years roll
[1:40:44] on she will still
[1:40:46] never fail
[1:40:48] god once breaks it he can't take it back
[1:40:51] i can speak and take it back so can you
[1:40:53] but once he speaks
[1:40:56] it's settled
[1:40:58] for
[1:40:59] ever
[1:41:00] not till the next revival
[1:41:02] you know so many people
[1:41:04] they'll come and they'll get a quickie
[1:41:07] and they're good to the next revival or
[1:41:09] the next service then they'll want to
[1:41:10] come back and get another quickie
[1:41:12] i'm here to tell you you need more than
[1:41:14] just a quickie
[1:41:16] you need an old-fashioned holy ghost
[1:41:19] birth
[1:41:20] you need to be born again of the spirit
[1:41:22] of god you need to be changed from the
[1:41:25] inside out
[1:41:31] and if you ever get that
[1:41:33] you know brother dan used to talk about
[1:41:34] his son davey
[1:41:37] davey still doesn't serve the lord but
[1:41:39] brother dan had a desire to see him
[1:41:42] serve god
[1:41:43] and brother dan always made the
[1:41:44] statement he said if god ever does for
[1:41:46] davey
[1:41:47] what he did for me i won't have to worry
[1:41:49] about him anymore
[1:41:51] and a few parents sitting here with lost
[1:41:53] children backslid children out of
[1:41:55] fellowship children
[1:41:56] if god ever does for them what he did
[1:41:58] for you
[1:41:59] what what keeps you coming back
[1:42:02] service after service after service
[1:42:04] there's so many things in this in this
[1:42:06] world brother thomas that are
[1:42:08] distracting and pulling and drawing and
[1:42:11] trying to to get people to leave the
[1:42:13] message and leave the word and all these
[1:42:16] things but there's something
[1:42:20] there's something down on the inside of

[1:42:24] back
[1:42:26] and it keeps drawing you
[1:42:28] it's like the song says

[1:42:35] to live in a higher plane
[1:42:38] this world listen they're they're
[1:42:40] they're so
[1:42:42] in such chaos
[1:42:44] they don't know from one day to the next
[1:42:46] what's going to be and what's going to
[1:42:47] happen listen
[1:42:49] we can't tell you the fine details but
[1:42:51] we know what the word has taught us and
[1:42:53] what the prophet has taught us and what
[1:42:55] we're seeing is the actual fulfillment
[1:42:58] of what we've been taught
[1:43:01] amen it's it's happening right before
[1:43:04] our eyes listen i grew up like like your
[1:43:06] pastor in this message my dad
[1:43:09] preached this message up and down when
[1:43:11] when brother branham came to spindale
[1:43:12] north carolina and you can find four
[1:43:14] services uh in in the registry preached
[1:43:17] in spindale my dad was an usher in those
[1:43:19] meetings it was dad's pastor that
[1:43:21] brought brother adam to spin dale
[1:43:23] and and and when when dad and his
[1:43:26] brother uncle albert they traveled up
[1:43:27] and down the countryside listened to
[1:43:30] alan and roberts and cole and the
[1:43:31] osborne and all the great names
[1:43:34] but when dad
[1:43:35] told me and told it around the world
[1:43:37] when he heard brother adam speak before
[1:43:39] he even spoke
[1:43:41] when he come out the door onto the
[1:43:43] platform before he even said evening
[1:43:45] friends
[1:43:47] dad said i found myself just weeping
[1:43:49] i found myself in tears at the presence
[1:43:52] that came with him out of that office
[1:43:56] and that wasn't that little kentucky
[1:43:57] hillbilly that was the presence of
[1:43:59] almighty god
[1:44:01] amen that came through there and dad
[1:44:03] said when i got my composure and i
[1:44:05] looked around everybody around me was in
[1:44:07] the same condition because of that
[1:44:09] presence and dad said i've heard alan
[1:44:12] i've heard cole i've heard roberts i've
[1:44:14] heard
[1:44:15] theo jones and all the w v grant and all
[1:44:18] the great preachers he said but when i
[1:44:20] heard this little little preacher from
[1:44:22] kentucky i knew there was something more
[1:44:26] amen you and i most of you how many here
[1:44:29] you saw brother branham anybody here saw
[1:44:31] brother madam in person
[1:44:33] nobody in the actual services amen none
[1:44:36] of us saw him
[1:44:38] none of us
[1:44:39] felt that presence
[1:44:41] but we we have witnesses that have
[1:44:43] testified and told us that's what it was
[1:44:45] about that's that's how it happened
[1:44:47] that's the reality of it and listen to
[1:44:49] that i'm not believing it because my
[1:44:51] daddy told me that i'm not believing it
[1:44:53] because my daddy taught me about a
[1:44:55] prophet listen when i was coming up all
[1:44:57] i heard god sent a prophet god sent a
[1:44:59] prophet god sent a prophet god sent a
[1:45:01] prophet now the servants went by that we
[1:45:02] didn't hear it god sent a prophet god
[1:45:04] sent a message
[1:45:05] amen and then as time progressed
[1:45:09] and the books became available and the
[1:45:11] message became in print the tapes were
[1:45:13] available the men of god began to hear
[1:45:16] what the prophet began to say
[1:45:19] and when they began to catch the
[1:45:20] revelation of what he was saying listen
[1:45:22] it's not just to have a book it's not
[1:45:24] just to have a tape what you got to have
[1:45:27] is the reality of what was being said
[1:45:29] right down in here and that's why i'm
[1:45:31] here preaching tonight not because my
[1:45:33] daddy preached not because my daddy
[1:45:35] called me listen my daddy never called
[1:45:37] me he never told me as a preacher he
[1:45:39] told brother ron amen and through the
[1:45:41] discernment told him he's going to be a
[1:45:43] preacher told him we was going to make
[1:45:44] some trips together amen and different
[1:45:47] brothers different young ministers dad
[1:45:49] through that gift that he had he said
[1:45:51] you're going to be a preacher of the
[1:45:52] gospel you're going to preach the gospel
[1:45:54] you're going to preach the gospel but
[1:45:55] never did tell me
[1:45:56] i'm glad he didn't brother thomas
[1:45:59] because i don't want to be daddy called
[1:46:00] says connie
[1:46:01] i want to be called of god
[1:46:04] and i want you to understand when i when
[1:46:06] i come to the place to recognize
[1:46:08] amen it was a calling of god let me tell
[1:46:12] you amen i i i understood there's more
[1:46:16] to it than just playing church
[1:46:18] there's more to it than just saying well
[1:46:20] i've been called to preach there is a
[1:46:22] commitment there is a there is a
[1:46:24] something that you have to to have to
[1:46:26] have to
[1:46:27] put your nose to the grindstone as it
[1:46:29] were amen and get serious with god
[1:46:32] because what i'm doing tonight and what
[1:46:34] these brothers do when they stand here
[1:46:35] before you it's not something to take
[1:46:37] lightly
[1:46:39] because your souls rest in our hands and
[1:46:41] what we tell you
[1:46:44] a lot of people want to discredit what
[1:46:45] we tell you they want to say well it's
[1:46:47] not true and i'm trying to quit they
[1:46:49] want to say it's it you know it's it's
[1:46:50] just a man-made thing but i'm here to
[1:46:53] tell you i have seen and you have to
[1:46:56] this message works
[1:47:00] this message works
[1:47:03] amen
[1:47:04] and it's it's not a fly-by-night message
[1:47:08] it's not a message that's up to day and
[1:47:10] down tomorrow this message is straight
[1:47:13] solid settled
[1:47:15] because this message is jesus christ the
[1:47:17] same yesterday today and forever
