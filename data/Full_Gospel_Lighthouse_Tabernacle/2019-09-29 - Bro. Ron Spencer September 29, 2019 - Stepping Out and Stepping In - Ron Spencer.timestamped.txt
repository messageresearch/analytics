[3:45] you've ever been inspired to sing a song
[3:46] tonight what's that I am speaking
[3:49] tonight on stepping out and stepping in
[3:55] bless you John chapter 1 verse 1
[4:10] John chapter 1 and verse 1 in the
[4:18] beginning was the word and the Word was
[4:21] with God and the Word was God
[4:25] in an amazing that he wrote that 2,000
[4:29] years ago and yet there's denominational
[4:32] churches all over the world that hadn't
[4:34] figured out that God's 1 the same was in
[4:39] the beginning with God
[4:41] and all things were made by him and
[4:43] without him was not anything that was
[4:46] made in him was life and the life was
[4:51] the light of men and the light shanna
[4:54] then darkness and the darkness
[4:56] comprehended that not there was a man
[5:00] sent from God whose name was John and
[5:02] the same came for a witness to bear
[5:04] witness of the light that all men
[5:07] through him might believe he was not
[5:11] that light but was sent to bear witness
[5:14] of that light that was the true light
[5:18] which lighteth every man that cometh
[5:21] into the world he was in the world and
[5:25] the world was made by him and the world
[5:28] knew him not like for you to read that
[5:31] verse with me he was in the world and
[5:34] the world was made by him and the world
[5:38] knew him not he came to his own and his
[5:42] own received him not but as many as
[5:45] received him to them gave he power to
[5:48] become the sons of God even to them that
[5:52] believe on his name which were born not
[5:55] of blood nor the will of flesh nor the
[5:59] will of man but of God and the Word was
[6:03] made flesh and dwelt among us and we
[6:06] beheld his glory the glory as the only
[6:10] begotten of the Father full of grace and
[6:14] truth amen maybe I've need tonight you
[6:17] just like to raise your hand before the
[6:18] Lord amen god bless you amen
[6:21] Almighty God we love you with all of our
[6:24] hearts tonight Lord we ask you that you
[6:27] would anoint our lips we can study and
[6:30] lay aside time and prepare but Lord it
[6:33] it's like a lady that cooks an
[6:36] incredible feast if people aren't hungry
[6:40] it won't be much of an environment but
[6:43] father we realize that your bride pulls
[6:46] on the word and I ask you once again
[6:48] that you would anoint this audience
[6:50] anoint the people that were here Lord
[6:53] made you touch us sweep down through
[6:55] these these places tonight and come to
[6:58] where we're sitting father anoint this
[7:01] vessel that we can step behind this this
[7:04] sacred desk and may man not see me but
[7:08] may they see Jesus that's what we've
[7:10] come to not step to this pulpit tonight
[7:13] we pray in Jesus Christ's name you may
[7:16] be seated
[7:24] there's been some incredible steps that
[7:27] take place and I'd like to just kind of
[7:29] grab your attention just for a few
[7:31] moments there's been some incredible
[7:33] steps that has taken place in humanity
[7:36] first of all when Adam stepped out of
[7:40] the Garden of Eden he made a decision
[7:46] that decision was his eyes were wide
[7:49] open Adam Adam was not deceived he knew
[7:54] exactly what he's doing he could have
[7:57] allowed Eve to be destroyed but he took
[8:00] her place and placed his seed inside of
[8:05] her that she could be saved now you see
[8:10] God did not did not when he cast him out
[8:15] of the Garden of Eden he did not have to
[8:19] redeem them
[8:22] he could have allowed them to walk out
[8:24] of the Garden of Eden and just allow
[8:26] them to become just dust fallen but God
[8:30] made a way back he made a way back and
[8:34] he called him back and as he calls them
[8:36] back there has to be a substitute for
[8:39] the sin that takes place something's got
[8:42] to die in their place something's got to
[8:46] die in their place and so we realized
[8:49] that he took a lamb and he took the skin
[8:52] and slayed the lamb God did and wrapped
[8:55] that skin around Adam and Eve we hear
[8:58] the prophet of God has said that one
[9:00] night as he's preaching he said the
[9:02] other night I watched Adam and Eve walk
[9:05] out of the Garden of Eden now what you
[9:08] just think about this just for a moment
[9:10] war took place in heaven way before this
[9:14] earth Adam was on the earth God cast
[9:19] Lucifer out of heaven with the angels
[9:24] that fell with him are you with me and
[9:27] God Himself did not try to redeem them
[9:33] but when one son fell when one son
[9:38] failed God came running through the
[9:41] Garden of Eden
[9:45] Adam would there would be a statement
[9:48] that was made in these generations that
[9:50] we live in now a man named Neil
[9:53] Armstrong there was aspirations that
[9:56] they would go to the moon an exploration
[9:59] and where a man could put his feet as a
[10:03] matter of fact several different nations
[10:05] were trying to get there and it was a it
[10:07] was a race in space and a race to get to
[10:11] the moon and and and there was a man
[10:14] named Neil Armstrong some don't believe
[10:17] that people went to the moon
[10:19] some still don't believe that but it
[10:21] don't matter tonight no way where I'm
[10:24] not here to put that argument there but
[10:27] but brother Doug Baker's probably the
[10:29] most smartest man that I ever met in my
[10:31] life and he's a fish
[10:34] engineer and I I don't even know how to
[10:38] say what he is but he said there's
[10:41] there's actually telescopes that that
[10:44] you can see where they were at so I'll
[10:46] just take their word for it
[10:48] I'm not going but Neil Armstrong is he's
[10:55] no doubt it's a choreographed statement
[10:58] but is he all the dreams and all the
[11:02] money's and all the aspirations and all
[11:04] the engineering and and now they've
[11:07] landed on the moon and now he's a man
[11:10] stepping on the moon and and he's he's
[11:13] got his suit on because because man when
[11:17] he went there couldn't live in the
[11:19] moon's atmosphere so he had to take
[11:23] earthly atmosphere to the moon that'll
[11:27] preach and so you and I have to take a
[11:31] heavenly atmosphere to live here and so
[11:36] Neil Armstrong as he stepped down he
[11:38] made this statement one small step for
[11:43] man one giant step for mankind whether
[11:51] the world wants to realize realize it or
[11:53] not tonight we are coming to the end of
[11:57] the Gentile dispensation we've come to
[12:01] the end of it we are just before the
[12:04] Tribulation Period to set in destruction
[12:07] lays before us Israel is expecting two
[12:11] prophets to come and to speak to them
[12:14] there will come a hundred and forty four
[12:16] thousand out of that group a nation that
[12:19] is torn with its own laws a nation that
[12:21] has its own perversion a nation that has
[12:24] eat up with all different kinds of
[12:26] religions and and wars amongst
[12:29] themselves cabinets that fight we think
[12:32] our cabinets fight Israel's cabinets
[12:34] fight much worse than ours does much war
[12:37] takes place and their own governments
[12:39] there's a reason for that man has
[12:43] trouble governing himself but there's
[12:47] coming a king are you with me there's
[12:51] coming a king and its King Jesus where
[12:54] we'll live in perfect peace now they are
[12:58] expecting they they are looking for a
[13:01] messiah and he's coming he's on his way
[13:04] but before they can get their Messiah we
[13:08] have to leave the earth there must be a
[13:12] rapture take place for the Gentile bride
[13:15] now we've had her message we've had her
[13:19] prophet God's vindicated him around the
[13:22] world seven times and he's had his
[13:24] picture taken with him over and over
[13:26] again
[13:27] let me just say God did extraordinary
[13:29] things we can talk about the miracles
[13:32] for months about what God did in this
[13:34] generation not just with the Prophet but
[13:38] with the ministry that came under the
[13:39] inspiration of that prophet that has now
[13:42] walked the earth you see God has laid
[13:47] his hands on the bride of Jesus Christ
[13:49] spoke her into existence gathered her
[13:53] out of denominational systems and and
[13:55] brought her unto unto himself understand
[14:00] this is God's doing many have tried to
[14:04] destroy and many have tried to ridicule
[14:07] many have tried to make fun of but you
[14:10] can't stop what God's doing no more than
[14:13] you could stop John the Baptist cut his
[14:16] head off but the mission was through you
[14:19] see God would step out of eternity into
[14:24] a realm of time because Adams race fell
[14:29] and they were given a substitute down
[14:33] through the Old Testament but the blood
[14:35] of bulls and goats could not make a man
[14:38] the dwelling place of the Holy Ghost are
[14:42] you with me it only covered their sins
[14:45] the desire didn't leave them are you
[14:48] with me now now there would be times to
[14:50] where that God would step from that
[14:52] realm to this room he came down and he
[14:55] spoke to Moses
[14:57] we heard last night that Moses was not
[14:59] ashamed because he had met that pillar
[15:03] of fire now let me just say when you
[15:05] meet that pillar of fire personally for
[15:07] yourself I heard brother Shannon in his
[15:10] prayer tonight as he prayed and I stood
[15:13] back in that office and I said that man
[15:15] can pray like that because he's met that
[15:18] pillar of fire we're not ashamed of
[15:22] where we stand in this day
[15:24] let's Satan rage and his kingdom scream
[15:28] that will be a bride and I will be one
[15:33] of them
[15:38] [Applause]
[15:56] through the prophets God would show an
[16:00] attribute of himself and there was
[16:04] moments that you could see God in Moses
[16:06] and you saw God and then there were
[16:09] times that you saw Moses throughout the
[16:16] Old Testament God the writers had to
[16:19] write their faults because they were
[16:26] only attributes of God to where God
[16:29] would pour a portion of himself in to
[16:32] allow people to see that this was the
[16:34] Word of God to the generation I don't
[16:38] know if you heard brother Tim the other
[16:40] day when he was preaching here and you
[16:42] caught it but when brother Tim was
[16:44] preaching he would talked about Moses
[16:46] and the children of Israel that left
[16:49] Egypt only one in five left only one in
[16:57] five left Egypt 20% left Egypt in the
[17:04] Exodus 80 percent stayed in Egypt you
[17:17] read the book and you think well
[17:19] everybody left everybody just left
[17:22] everybody put the token on the door and
[17:24] everybody just left but only 20% of the
[17:31] Jews that were in Egypt thought the
[17:34] message of the hour
[17:38] hallelujah and then when they got to to
[17:42] the to the to the border to the Red Sea
[17:45] and they were standing there and the
[17:47] greatest army was behind them let me
[17:50] just say it took faith to step out into
[17:53] the water it took real faith when 80
[17:59] percent turns around and they don't even
[18:02] move but you've had faith to get here
[18:04] and now you look like you're going to be
[18:07] mad are you with me Jewish tradition
[18:14] says this that Moses stretched his right
[18:16] out over the sea you know in our minds
[18:22] we get we get Hollywood to the point to
[18:25] where that it just opens up so quickly
[18:27] but there's a family that was in the in
[18:31] the Jewish families that actually
[18:33] started marching into the water and they
[18:37] marched till they was up their necks and
[18:39] the water opened up sometimes we're
[18:44] challenged to take a step
[18:51] I want to say this to you don't get your
[18:59] eyes on the uncommitted they're not
[19:03] going don't get your eyes on the people
[19:06] that are only wanting to go so far
[19:08] they're not going but there will be a
[19:11] bride
[19:12] that will take a rapture don't even get
[19:18] your eyes on me keep your eyes on him
[19:27] [Applause]
[19:47] Jesus is the Greek form of Joshua that
[19:52] name the name of Jesus is the sum total
[19:55] of all that Jehovah was in the Old
[19:57] Testament for the Jehovah of the Old
[20:01] Testament
[20:03] it's the Jesus of the new Jesus is the
[20:11] sum total of every title of Jehovah the
[20:17] Lord our Creator the Lord the Most High
[20:21] God the owner the Lord the master the
[20:26] Lord the everlasting the Lord the
[20:28] provider the Lord the healer the Lord
[20:31] the banner our miracle the Lord our
[20:35] sanctification the Lord our peace the
[20:40] Lord the judge the Lord of Hosts the
[20:43] Lord our righteousness the Lord the
[20:45] shepherd the Lord the blesser the Lord
[20:48] the maker the Lord the mighty the Lord
[20:51] the Jehovah the Lord the ever-present
[20:54] the same yesterday today and forever he
[21:02] was he is and he always will be
[21:04] the Lord the purpose of what God was was
[21:13] promising in sending the Holy Spirit
[21:17] they said I wouldn't you would mark John
[21:19] 14 the beginning said reading through
[21:22] the chapter for the basis
[21:24] God's purpose we find in sinning the
[21:27] Holy Spirit was one purpose that God
[21:30] himself might dwell in his church and
[21:34] continue his plans through the church
[21:38] that God was in Christ continuing his
[21:42] plans through Christ out of Christ into
[21:45] the church continuing his work through
[21:48] the church and we know what the Holy
[21:52] Spirit is we find out last night that
[21:55] it's God and then we think of God the
[22:00] Father and Jesus spoke of here his
[22:02] father God and the son as Jesus God the
[22:06] Holy Spirit as what we call it today now
[22:09] what does God mean that there is three
[22:12] individual distinct God's it means that
[22:15] there is one God it's one God may we say
[22:22] it like this all that God was he poured
[22:25] into Christ because he's emptied himself
[22:28] and he poured it into Christ and Christ
[22:31] was the fullness of the Godhead bodily
[22:34] we know that it's Colossians chapter 2
[22:36] all that Jehovah was he poured it into
[22:41] Christ and all that Christ was he ported
[22:45] into the church not into one individual
[22:49] but into the entire body and then we
[22:55] come together in unity and we have power
[22:58] I want you to notice we have power what
[23:01] do we need power for today to live in
[23:04] overcoming life
[23:07] why don't we need power when we get sick
[23:10] that we can take God in His Word and
[23:12] step into a body a well body
[23:17] for the run but one day we'll step into
[23:19] a resurrected theophany body but what
[23:21] about a well body hurry with me but man
[23:27] said God will make your body obey your
[23:30] confession
[23:35] hallelujah for God was made flesh and
[23:39] dwelt among us Timothy the first Timothy
[23:43] 3:16 he says without controversy great
[23:47] is the mystery of godliness God was
[23:50] manifested in the flesh we handled him
[23:53] God Jehovah made flesh walked on the
[23:56] earth and we saw him with our eyes what
[24:04] percentage was that I'd say one in a
[24:06] million
[24:08] I'd say one in a million
[24:14] why are you bringing that up brother 1
[24:16] sometimes on your campus sometimes in
[24:19] your facility of workplace you're the
[24:21] only one you're the only one and you
[24:30] work literally in darkness you work
[24:34] literally in darkness and you're the
[24:37] only one dressed like you're dressed and
[24:39] you're the only one that conducts
[24:41] yourself like you do and you can't hold
[24:46] yourself and you know that God's holding
[24:49] you are you with me and you know what
[24:53] you was and you know what your your your
[24:56] aspirations is to be and he's got a hold
[24:59] to your life and you realize it's not
[25:03] you doing it's much him living through
[25:07] you
[25:14] nobody else believe it it doesn't matter
[25:19] it doesn't matter jesus said I and my
[25:23] father won it didn't matter what none of
[25:26] the religions said because he was
[25:29] telling them the truth and he told them
[25:32] you of your father the devil
[25:33] I wonder I heard Andrew as he was
[25:36] speaking last night and forgive me for
[25:38] getting off-key here just for a moment
[25:40] but I wonder I wonder how many of us
[25:43] would all of a sudden feel shame if you
[25:49] invited brother Branham to the pool prep
[25:51] and that day and brother Brandon was
[25:57] very cordial for a bit and then all of a
[25:59] sudden and all of a sudden the truth
[26:04] starts rolling I listened to door in the
[26:09] door this morning brother Brad was very
[26:12] cordial he was much the Full Gospel
[26:14] businessman he was very cordial a nice
[26:16] listen of course I be listening to it
[26:18] probably hundreds of times but and I
[26:20] just know here he is at his cordial in
[26:22] his cordial way and he's being such a
[26:24] gentleman in about 30 minutes either
[26:29] they're going to be ashamed or proud
[26:31] they're standing with them let me just
[26:34] say those disciples that were standing
[26:36] with Jesus it was a spot that he puts
[26:39] them then when Jesus turned to those
[26:43] those well recognized priests and said
[26:49] you are of your father the devil your
[26:54] father's did eat manna in the wilderness
[26:55] and there everyone jabbed come on church
[27:05] come on Church Jesus turned around and
[27:10] said blessed is he that is not offended
[27:12] in me sometimes you'll have to make a
[27:16] stand
[27:19] sometimes you'll have to make a stand we
[27:23] walked into McDonald's across the
[27:25] mountain and we walked in and and our
[27:27] sisters here sister Joyce and sister
[27:29] Evelyn they were proud of glasses
[27:31] pastors you'd have thought the governor
[27:34] of the state had walked in and they they
[27:37] took us over and wanted us to sit down
[27:39] and they bought us an apple pie it was
[27:40] good and a coffee and and they wanted us
[27:44] to sit and talk to all their friends
[27:45] they weren't ashamed of us
[27:48] as a matter of fact they were edging on
[27:50] a sermon just to bid if they could have
[27:54] you know that's the truth but how many
[28:00] times does people curl and just your
[28:07] presence causes a conviction to come and
[28:11] there's another feeling not not proud
[28:14] but in a shame feeling crush the mystery
[28:31] he said the first thing was God wanted
[28:35] to reveal himself to the people and he
[28:39] couldn't do that as Jehovah God who
[28:43] covered all space time and eternity he
[28:49] could not he is too great to ever be
[28:54] revealed to people because it would be
[28:57] too mysterious how could that be in that
[29:03] never did predict begin that after you
[29:08] went beyond the cycle of hundreds of
[29:10] billions of trillions of trillions of
[29:13] years of light space and go out into the
[29:17] infinite into the eternity how great
[29:22] creature that all was and that is but
[29:29] what he wanted to
[29:31] oh he loved fatherhood for he was a
[29:35] father and the only way he could express
[29:40] it was to become a son a man how did God
[29:48] hide himself from Lucifer and all of his
[29:51] works he became man and beyond any of
[29:58] that he became a man a baby that was
[30:04] immediately called illegitimate you know
[30:14] you heard me talk about Moses in a
[30:16] pillar of fire how many people were

[39:54] them now notice as it rolls down his
[39:56] cheek and the tears immortal now he has
[39:59] to die mortal now he has to die I want
[40:04] to say something while I was at brother
[40:06] Kelly Hildebrandt's I wrote a sermon
[40:08] down that that I that I'll preach one
[40:11] day here there's only one time to be
[40:15] mortal
[40:18] you'll only be mortal this once you'll
[40:26] only be mortal this once he wants me
[40:30] make right choices don't waste today
[40:35] listen to the scream of the word of God
[40:38] as it screams out to you are you with me
[40:43] in that dimension it'll be no getting
[40:46] right with God
[40:48] there'll be no pleading the blood of
[40:50] Jesus Christ I wish I'd have done things
[40:52] a different it's only this and we're not
[40:55] promised tomorrow I wanna I want to I
[40:59] want to be very clear with you we're not
[41:00] promised tomorrow
[41:02] I opened the paper this week open the
[41:14] paper and a friend of mine and I'm
[41:19] talking about a real guy I'm talking
[41:21] about a standout in the community since
[41:24] he was a boy a real man
[41:34] and I look all the accolades of life
[41:36] what he did
[41:37] what do you accomplish what this resign
[41:40] or this or that it's gone it's over it's
[41:44] over all of his influence is done now
[41:46] are you with me now you'll be remembered
[41:48] maybe another generation another two
[41:50] generations and then it's gone then
[41:54] strong after a few generations even your
[41:56] name kind of disappears from the map I
[41:58] can't help that that's just a cycle of
[42:00] the life it's just gone it's it's it's
[42:04] just over wealth listen only in that
[42:06] wall that time segment grab ahold of it
[42:10] it's only what you do for Jesus let me
[42:16] to say this let me just pause just for a
[42:18] moment let me say we've got all got
[42:20] friends in other realms of life but
[42:24] don't let those friends influence you
[42:27] and your choices to serve Jesus Christ
[42:32] because without Jesus they're headed in
[42:35] one dimension and you're headed in
[42:37] another dimension
[42:44] [Applause]
[42:53] brother ray when this life is over the
[42:56] same question is settled it's settled
[43:00] it's a done deal
[43:02] it's done stepping from from this
[43:05] dimension stepping out you're gonna step
[43:07] into another body some way or another or
[43:14] you catching what's going on here
[43:16] tonight I'm talking to a group of people
[43:19] and I make a declaration to you we're
[43:23] not just a church I want to I want to
[43:27] say this is as firm as I know how to say
[43:29] we're not just a church this building
[43:34] looks like a church it is a church but
[43:36] this is not just a church or you go to
[43:40] church on Saturday and Sunday night like
[43:42] I I think it's absolutely imperative
[43:45] when we come to church don't forsake the
[43:48] assembling of God don't forsake yourself
[43:51] you come but let me just say this you
[43:55] service should go on every day your
[44:02] worship should go on seven days a week
[44:04] and bring the strength from home and
[44:08] work and come to church what you listen
[44:13] to during the week may it be food from
[44:15] God but the run but I feel so back slid
[44:20] in my spirit what are you feeding on
[44:24] it's very simple thing what are you
[44:26] feeding on my child's not growing my
[44:30] child isn't getting nourishment what are
[44:32] you feeding that child well brother on I
[44:37] just feel half disconnected when I come
[44:39] to church I don't know what anybody's
[44:41] talking about what are you listening to
[44:45] what are you listening to during the
[44:47] week what are you feeding your honor Fox
[44:56] News has no rap three-phase ESPN has no
[45:01] rapturing faith all of the nonsense of
[45:03] the world has some no rapture in faith
[45:05] your Facebook has no rapture in faith I
[45:20] got an interesting letter this week was
[45:25] email interesting a letter from our
[45:30] insurance company was talking about how
[45:32] pastors give references and I thought it
[45:35] had an interesting statement in it said
[45:37] never give a reference until you look at
[45:39] their social media pages so maybe for
[45:51] before now I'll just make it a just just
[45:53] general rule here before I make a
[45:56] recommendation on your job you let me
[46:04] borrow your phone for a few minutes
[46:20] rather on that's pretty difficult really
[46:22] it ain't nothing to what God's going to
[46:25] do he's going to rapture people off of
[46:28] the earth and he suggests God he can't
[46:32] rapture people that are not worthy it's
[46:38] not like picking flowers here well I'll
[46:40] take this one I'll take that one you
[46:42] have to have the blood band ready and
[46:47] that's that's let me just say this you I
[46:50] am what I am here or where I'm in China
[46:53] or in Australia I am this way seven days
[46:57] a week
[46:59] brother homers last sermon was beat you
[47:02] therefore ready for in such an hours you
[47:05] think not we're going to step into
[47:07] eternity one way or another
[47:30] very good
[47:41] I can just imagine if you were a real
[47:47] believer in the days of Paul and those
[47:53] men and this guy was killing some of
[47:58] your family some of I been in prison
[48:03] some of them had been stoned
[48:05] some of them have been burnt and now
[48:09] this guy is going to get papers and his
[48:14] carrying papers to come to your house
[48:17] and now he has an experience and a
[48:24] pillar of fire men are rounding they're
[48:28] around him and they're on their horses
[48:29] and they're carrying out their there
[48:31] there with him and they're under the
[48:33] influence of what he is but this man
[48:35] seemed ibly comes off of his horse and
[48:39] he's on the road and he and he's down
[48:43] and he's down on the road and pay
[48:47] attention now
[48:48] and he's on the road and his is there
[48:52] and now a pillar fire appears before him
[48:56] and he knows the Old Testament God
[48:58] identified himself as pillar father and
[49:00] he knows he's not under don't allusion
[49:03] and he sees the pillar fire and God
[49:05] begins to speak like he did through
[49:07] Moses and through Elisha through the
[49:09] pillar of fire and God says I am Jesus
[49:13] I am Jesus
[49:22] are you with me between the steps of
[49:26] that horse from one step to another step
[49:32] that predestinated seed came to life a
[49:35] moment ago he was an accuser of the
[49:38] Brethren and now he's one of them when
[49:44] he gets back on the horse he's a
[49:45] believer he got off of the horse that's
[49:50] an accuser he got back on the horse
[49:52] brother Nathanael as a believer glory to
[50:03] God some of us has found herself in
[50:07] those conditions
[50:08] maybe fighting it with all of our heart
[50:11] and then all of a sudden Jesus becomes
[50:13] real to us
[50:21] Isaiah stepped into that presence he's
[50:26] under the influence of Uzziah but once
[50:29] he comes into the presence of God he
[50:33] said what was me

[1:01:39] of your heart your respiration is gone
[1:01:42] the cancers eat you up your blood
[1:01:44] streams become completely cancer

[1:02:33] on church God's a healer well brother on
[1:02:37] what if I die from it
[1:02:39] it'll be your portal from this room to
[1:02:41] that room but it won't have victory over
[1:02:44] top lane you it only becomes a doorway
[1:02:47] for you to step through
[1:02:50] [Applause]
[1:03:13] you'd like to be like that ole Elijah
[1:03:16] when he walked up and down before the
[1:03:18] idol and said why don't you call out a
[1:03:21] little louder you talk about confidence
[1:03:27] why don't you call out a little louder
[1:03:29] why don't you call out louder were you
[1:03:38] doing that for brother run I'm gonna
[1:03:39] give this to somebody I'm gonna give it
[1:03:44] to somebody somebody that really needs
[1:03:47] it because when we was in China they
[1:03:51] were giving us cows and weed wiper Brown
[1:03:53] throw him down and they'd come grab him
[1:03:58] and let me just tell you that was
[1:04:01] phenomenal testimonies that took place
[1:04:03] one of them a man died later he later
[1:04:08] died his little boy died are you with me
[1:04:11] now
[1:04:12] his little boy died and he remembered it
[1:04:14] he got one of them towels and he went
[1:04:16] later don't let this boy and that boy
[1:04:18] came back to life
[1:04:20] [Applause]
[1:04:35] boo dabble
[1:04:37] [Applause]
[1:04:47] you'd be like that Oh Elijah when he
[1:04:50] walked up and down before the idol said
[1:04:52] why don't you call out a little louder
[1:04:54] maybe he's pursuing he knowed what he
[1:04:57] was doing because God had told him it
[1:04:58] was going to happen and he said let the
[1:05:01] God but answers by fire be God they
[1:05:06] poured water on the altars they cut
[1:05:08] themselves they done everything they
[1:05:09] called out - bail bail answer us bail
[1:05:12] answer us and Elijah was just as calm as
[1:05:14] he could be and he said call out a
[1:05:16] little hotter
[1:05:16] maybe he's pursuing maybe he's on a
[1:05:18] fishing trip maybe he's doing something
[1:05:20] else he's out there somewhere and he
[1:05:22] just made fun of them because he knew
[1:05:25] something was going to happen and watch
[1:05:27] when he got everything in order and he
[1:05:30] walked out there and said Lord God of
[1:05:31] Abraham Isaac and of Israel he never
[1:05:34] called him by his name Jacob shankster
[1:05:37] he called him Israel Prince with and
[1:05:50] when I come to that point tonight I
[1:05:53] thought about this is me there was a
[1:05:56] time when I was a stinker when I was a
[1:05:59] shyster when I was a nothing but when
[1:06:01] Jesus came I stepped from that realm to
[1:06:04] another realm
[1:06:12] whether I feel him or unknown feel him
[1:06:14] or who does another miracle or another
[1:06:16] miracle I've seen hundreds and thousands
[1:06:17] of miracles by now he don't have to do
[1:06:19] anything else for me but he's promised
[1:06:22] me lay hands on the sick and they shall
[1:06:24] recover in my name you'll cast out
[1:06:26] devils he's going to continue the work
[1:06:30] ain't my doings it's God's doing I want
[1:06:41] to ask you tonight as you sit here you
[1:06:51] said here tonight and maybe this would
[1:06:54] be the witch it is the last time it's
[1:06:57] your pastor speak to you for a couple of
[1:06:58] weeks and I would have any words for you
[1:07:01] to help you get through the next few
[1:07:04] weeks I want to leave you with these
[1:07:06] words are you ready you see a lot of
[1:07:11] things can happen in a few weeks
[1:07:15] I'll be here next week with brother Joe
[1:07:17] and me cheering him on probably at the
[1:07:21] picnic oh I'm gonna give a talk a sermon
[1:07:26] prayer line around the fire God just
[1:07:33] does supernatural things the Peter is
[1:07:39] standing with Jesus it's coming to a
[1:07:43] vital hour I'd say it's a kind of a
[1:07:46] battle hour or at now because God was
[1:07:50] moving from Jew two Gentiles but it's
[1:07:57] got to have a spokesman that will take
[1:08:00] them in the baptism in the name of Lord
[1:08:02] Jesus Christ and the spokesman really
[1:08:06] don't know who he is yet and the Lord
[1:08:11] said Simon Simon the whole Satan hath
[1:08:16] desired to have you that he might sift
[1:08:19] you as wheat
[1:08:20] I love these next words but I pray for
[1:08:35] thee
[1:08:37] that's our faith you didn't you you
[1:08:46] think Jesus didn't see him deny thrice
[1:08:49] sure he did
[1:08:51] did Jesus give up on him no it did will
[1:08:56] this man be the spokesman on the day of
[1:08:57] Pentecost absolutely he'll stand until
[1:09:03] that this Jesus whom you crucified God
[1:09:06] has made him both Lord and Christ you
[1:09:10] crucified him but God made him both Lord
[1:09:13] and Christ now he's going to stand down
[1:09:16] he's going to preach to them of who he
[1:09:20] is and now for you to get salvation is
[1:09:24] you got to repent so there's some
[1:09:27] stepping you got to do and you got to be
[1:09:29] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:09:32] Christ for the remission of your sins
[1:09:38] and then you should receive the gift of
[1:09:41] the Holy Ghost for this promises unto
[1:09:43] you and to your children as many as are
[1:09:47] far off even as many as the Lord our God
[1:09:49] shall call so there were some steps from
[1:10:01] just being associated with Jesus and
[1:10:04] being an outspoken disciple to a failure
[1:10:09] till now feel with the very life of God
[1:10:11] and becomes a spokesman of the church
[1:10:14] and now when it comes to his time to die
[1:10:17] and they're going to crucify him he said
[1:10:21] don't let me even don't let me be
[1:10:26] crucified like the Lord turn me upside
[1:10:28] down
[1:10:59] if you had cancer and the doctor told
[1:11:04] you yesterday that you'd be dead before
[1:11:08] Monday all of your heart your
[1:11:13] respiration is gone
[1:11:14] the cancers eats you up your blood
[1:11:17] streams completely completely cancer
[1:11:19] whatever it is and something's come with
[1:11:24] this substance of this genuine faith
[1:11:27] perfect faith was made a substance in
[1:11:31] you just a little while ago brother
