[42:02] we are so thankful for your drawing
[42:04] power Lord we even recognize that it is
[42:08] your power that has drawn us into your
[42:11] presence this morning it is nothing upon
[42:13] our own accord Lord that we've gathered
[42:15] ourselves here today Lord but it was you
[42:19] Lord that was a wooing and cooing over
[42:21] our hearts Lord and looking out across
[42:24] the the land father you've seen you've
[42:27] seen the generation that had to rise up
[42:29] father and you begin to draw us Lord by
[42:32] the magnetization of Thy word father you
[42:35] called us when everything else would
[42:37] have been bolted down and wouldn't have
[42:39] come to you but because there's
[42:41] something on the inside of us that is
[42:43] that is drawn to you father we cannot
[42:45] withhold ourselves any longer father and
[42:48] Lord today as we recognize that we are
[42:51] in thy presence Lord we invite you to
[42:53] come and to touch the hearts of your
[42:56] children today Father Lord we know that
[42:58] there are many afflictions that are upon
[43:01] the righteous but we recognize that you
[43:04] are the Lord that deliver us out of all
[43:06] of them little Ellie Grace father we put
[43:08] the blood of Jesus Christ over her and
[43:10] ask God do you touch her body Lord I
[43:13] pray for our pastor Lord I pray that you
[43:16] would completely restore his body father
[43:18] brother Randy there in the hospital and
[43:20] Lord we're asking God that you you know
[43:22] what you're doing father we don't
[43:24] question your ways father because your
[43:26] ways are higher than ours and Lord we go
[43:29] through things for a purpose father and
[43:31] we recognize that you're you have a
[43:34] greater purpose than what we can even
[43:35] imagine in our mind and we invite you
[43:38] father to to work out your word through
[43:41] our life father you would just call us
[43:43] into your presence Lord just to go a
[43:45] little bit deeper into Thy word and
[43:47] we'll spread out our Roots father like
[43:49] an old oak tree father who gives shelter
[43:51] to those around us father and we ask God
[43:54] that you had come today Lord we know
[43:56] that there are many needs here and I ask
[43:59] father that by the preaching of the word
[44:01] Lord that you would set the captives
[44:03] free father maybe it's healing in the
[44:05] body or maybe it's healing in the mind I
[44:08] ask father that you would allow healing
[44:10] the healing bombs of Gilead to roll over
[44:12] your children today now father we are
[44:15] we're commissioned to stand here and to
[44:17] preach the gospel now father I would ask
[44:19] Lord that you'd set me down over in a
[44:21] corner and begin to speak through my
[44:22] body Lord speak through my lips Lord and
[44:25] I recognize that you're the head and I'm
[44:27] the body father but Lord let it not just
[44:29] be myself that enter ends today Lord and
[44:32] may the whole body of Christ yield
[44:34] themselves over to the Supernatural and
[44:37] you'll have complete access here tonight
[44:39] today Lord and you'll manifest yourself
[44:42] in a way that that would be pleasing
[44:44] unto your spirit father Lord keep us
[44:47] forgive us of our sins in your name we
[44:50] pray these things amen and amen
[44:53] and if you have your Bibles today we'd
[44:56] like to look over in a few places in the
[44:58] scripture
[45:01] I'd like to look over first there into
[45:05] the Old Testament in the book of Isaiah
[45:08] Isaiah chapter 55 and verse 8 and down
[45:11] through verse 13. and I'll let you have
[45:16] your seats after after we read that
[45:18] portion of scripture and then and then
[45:20] I'll read the others I don't want to
[45:22] keep you standing and
[45:23] and uh
[45:25] Isaiah chapter 55 and verse 8 and
[45:28] brother J if you'll just come see me
[45:30] after service there I mean me and him's
[45:32] working out a little thing today for our
[45:34] youth so uh
[45:36] I kind of put him over over I
[45:38] commissioned him here so
[45:40] so just just remember to come see me
[45:42] Brother Jay Isaiah chapter 55 and verse
[45:45] 8 and today I would like to speak to you
[45:49] along along these lines of the true
[45:51] sheet the true seed shall rise the true
[45:55] seed shall rise so I'd like to title
[45:57] this today uh Rising above it all Rising
[46:01] above it all
[46:02] and the Lord kind of turned the diamond
[46:05] on me here in the last 10 minutes and so
[46:08] uh
[46:09] so let's let's just enjoy what the Lord
[46:12] has for us today amen Isaiah chapter 55
[46:15] and verse 8 for my thoughts are not your
[46:18] thoughts neither are your ways my ways
[46:21] saith the Lord for as the heavens are
[46:24] higher than the earth so are my ways
[46:26] higher than your ways and my thoughts
[46:29] than your thoughts for as the rain
[46:32] cometh down and the snow from heaven and
[46:34] returneth not thither but watereth the
[46:38] Earth and make it that bring forth Bud
[46:40] that it may give seed to the sower and
[46:44] bread to the eater I'm going to read
[46:45] that that portion of scripture one more
[46:47] time so you catch it for as the rain
[46:49] cometh down and the snow from heaven and
[46:51] returneth not thither but it watereth
[46:53] the Earth and maketh it bring forth and
[46:56] blood that it may give seed to the sower
[46:58] and bread to the eater's Souls shall my
[47:00] word be that goeth forth out of my mouth
[47:03] and it shall not return unto me void but
[47:06] it shall accomplish that which I please
[47:09] and it shall prosper in the thing
[47:12] whereto I sent it for ye shall go out
[47:15] with joy and be led forth with peace the
[47:18] mountains and the hills shall Break
[47:20] Forth before you into singing and the
[47:23] Trees of the field shall clap their
[47:25] hands instead of the Thorns shall come
[47:27] up the fir tree instead of the Briar
[47:29] shall come up the Myrtle tree and it
[47:32] shall be that to the Lord for a name for
[47:35] an everlasting sign that shall not be
[47:39] cut off may God bless his word you may
[47:41] be seated in the presence of the Lord as
[47:43] I said we'd like to just carry this
[47:46] thought today as the Lord would see
[47:47] fitting on Rising above it all at First
[47:50] Peter chapter 2 and verse 9 the Bible
[47:53] tells us but you are a chosen generation
[47:56] a royal priesthood and a holy nation A
[48:00] peculiar people that you should show
[48:02] forth the Praises of him who hath called
[48:05] you out of Darkness Into The Marvelous
[48:07] Light let's say that together who hath
[48:09] called you out of Darkness Into The
[48:12] Marvelous Light which in time past were
[48:15] not a people but are now the people of
[48:17] God which had not obtained Mercy but now
[48:19] have obtained Mercy also Galatians
[48:22] chapter 6 and verse 7 be not deceived
[48:26] God is Not mocked for whatsoever a man
[48:29] soweth that shall he also reap for he
[48:32] that soweth through the flesh shall also
[48:35] shall of the flesh or recurruption but
[48:37] he that soweth to the spirit shall love
[48:40] the spirit reap life Everlasting and let
[48:43] us not be weary in well-doing for in due
[48:46] season we shall reap if we faint not and
[48:50] I want you to read that aloud with me
[48:51] today verse 9 and let us not be weary in
[48:55] well-doing for in due season we shall
[48:58] reap if we faint not and if you'll just
[49:00] go back in your mind just a few weeks
[49:02] ago you remember that there was a tongue
[49:04] and there was an interpretation that
[49:06] came forth with those exact words be not
[49:08] we weary and well doing for in due
[49:11] season we shall rape if we faint not and
[49:14] I think it's a it's a it's a challenging
[49:17] thing to be to have a pastor like we've
[49:20] had stand before us that charges us and
[49:22] challenges us every single weekend that
[49:26] shows to thee to the rest of the world
[49:28] that there is a man that that is that
[49:30] has been diagnosed with with stage four
[49:33] cancer that stands up behind the pulpit
[49:35] and preaches the message of the hour in
[49:38] in its fullness and it's an entirety and
[49:41] I think it's it's a charge or it's a
[49:43] challenge over us as a Church of the
[49:45] Living God that that if men could do
[49:47] that in those kind of a bodies what
[49:49] should we be like if if we don't have
[49:51] that kind of thing that is upon us or
[49:53] that kind of Shadow that's hanging over
[49:55] top of us but I believe that brother Ron
[49:57] understands the the principles of the
[50:00] Bible that we shall reap if we faint not
[50:03] and I believe that is such a it's a a an
[50:06] inspiration to us in this hour to look
[50:08] at these things that God are these
[50:10] examples that God has set before us like
[50:13] brother Homer said here in a wheelchair
[50:15] and he preached to us day after day
[50:18] weekend after week and sometimes feeling
[50:20] good sometimes feeling bad sitting there
[50:22] in a wheelchair with with one leg and
[50:24] going through pain and all of those
[50:26] things but preaching with the tenacity
[50:28] of a lion preaching the message of the
[50:31] hour you got men like brother Tim Pruitt
[50:34] you got these other brothers that have
[50:35] gone through so many things but we
[50:38] recognize the power of this message that
[50:40] we are going to rise above everything
[50:44] rise above every circumstance rise above
[50:47] every disease rise above it all but God
[50:50] in this hour has called out a chosen
[50:52] that is called out of Darkness a people
[50:55] for his name's sake and we recognize
[50:59] that when when Peter is writing that the
[51:01] first the first letter of the first book
[51:03] The First Peter there he said that we
[51:06] being born again not of a corruptable
[51:08] seed but we are born again of an
[51:10] Incorruptible seed which does not fadeth
[51:13] away but it liveth and it abideth
[51:16] forever now we know that God is the god
[51:19] that is over all of his seeds and he's
[51:21] over top of all of this generation and
[51:24] we recognize that Satan is in
[51:26] understanding he realizes that he's only
[51:29] got a short time to work against the
[51:31] Church of the Living God so we recognize
[51:33] that we are in a spiritual warfare in
[51:36] between between Heaven and Earth but we
[51:40] recognize that we as the children of God
[51:42] we are in a battle for Heavenly places
[51:45] we look all the way back in the Garden
[51:47] of Eden and you can see that God planted
[51:50] seeds there but he allowed the spirit of
[51:53] God to move across the face of the deep
[51:55] and he called those seeds right out of
[51:58] the earth what was it it was the spirit
[52:01] of the Living God that would go across
[52:04] the seed and make it come to life and it
[52:07] is the same thing in this service today
[52:08] and throughout your life it was
[52:11] something that God had deposited on the
[52:14] inside of you that you couldn't do it on
[52:16] your own but God deposited something on
[52:19] the inside of you brother Chris that you
[52:21] could have never got up you could have
[52:23] never got out of your situation but God
[52:26] put something on the inside of you and
[52:28] he germatized that seed that he placed
[52:30] in the inside of you that's why there's
[52:32] such power in Revelation in this hour to
[52:35] recognize that there even though you go
[52:38] through trials even though you go
[52:40] through circumstances God has given you
[52:42] a revelation that you are going to rise
[52:45] above it all
[52:46] I think it's something to be be to look
[52:49] at today with with an open eye to look
[52:52] back even though you're going to go
[52:54] through the worst of times through the
[52:56] darkest of Ages for the most deceptive
[52:59] hour
[53:00] you're not gonna fall
[53:03] you're going to rise above it all
[53:07] Hallelujah and I think if there's one
[53:09] thing that we need today it's spiritual
[53:11] Revelation that's what the brother ran
[53:13] away would say to us he would tell us
[53:15] that the one thing that we need in this
[53:17] hour more than anything else is
[53:19] spiritual Revelation and he would speak
[53:21] to us in Satan's Eden he said I wanted
[53:23] to speak something to you to help you
[53:26] keep the punches off Satan's punches off
[53:29] of you
[53:30] brother random would tell us in a church
[53:32] age book he would tell us he said it's
[53:34] like he said that word or Revelation he
[53:36] said it means apocalypse which means
[53:39] unveiling and he said it's like a great
[53:41] sculptor as he is getting ready to
[53:43] remove it's it's what it was once hidden
[53:46] and it's sitting there to the onlooker
[53:49] and all it can see is the sheet that is
[53:51] hiding over that statue that he's
[53:53] already built but when that unveiling of
[53:56] the Revelation strikes it's when that
[53:58] great that great author that has built
[54:01] this that has built this statue he
[54:03] unveils it and now you can look unto the
[54:06] uh the onlooker can look on that I can
[54:09] see what was once hidden
[54:11] and to think that this hour is the day
[54:14] that he is showing himself to the
[54:16] onlookers of this generation
[54:18] he's not showing it to everybody but
[54:21] there was somebody in line that was
[54:23] waiting for him to pull the seals off
[54:26] the back of the book there was somebody
[54:28] that was waiting
[54:30] Hallelujah there was somebody that God
[54:32] was looking for that would stand there
[54:35] in line just waiting for it
[54:37] and you didn't recognize where you were
[54:39] but the spirit of the Living God he had
[54:42] you he had you to go through this one to
[54:44] that one and this one to that one but
[54:46] God knew exactly where you would be at
[54:50] you may have seemed like you weaved your
[54:52] ways out of this mess and back into
[54:54] another mess but there is nothing that
[54:56] has happened to your life that almighty
[54:58] God has not had in his hand
[55:01] he's had you in his hands the whole time
[55:03] some of you come out of mixed doctrines
[55:06] some of you come out on some of the most
[55:07] chaotic scenes of life but the onlooker
[55:11] was you but the one that revealed the
[55:13] seals is him and let me tell you if he's
[55:16] the one pulling and unveiling himself
[55:18] he's going to be the one that takes you
[55:22] takes you to the place that you belong
[55:25] in
[55:26] recognized that Satan has come to
[55:29] destroy that which God has deposited in
[55:32] this hour which is the gene of God and
[55:35] we recognize that we are up against a
[55:37] skillful opponent
[55:39] is that right
[55:41] he's been working against you for 6 000
[55:43] years
[55:44] he's been stacking up he's been stacking
[55:46] up all kinds of things that gets your
[55:48] family history we have a skillful
[55:50] opponent but you remember what the first
[55:53] John chapter 4 it tells us Brethren try
[55:56] the spirits whether they be of God or of
[55:59] not and we recognize at this age that we
[56:02] are living in it's the age of a
[56:04] lukewarmness and it's this age that
[56:07] takes a spiritual discernment to be able
[56:09] to be able to read between right and
[56:12] wrong to recognize to recognize the
[56:15] spirit of God and the spirit of Satan
[56:17] and we recognize that Jesus was telling
[56:19] us in Matthew chapter 24 and 24 that in
[56:23] the last days that false Christ would
[56:25] arise false anointed ones would arise in
[56:28] this generation and false prophets you
[56:30] watch that Antichrist is always attached
[56:33] to that false prophet notice notice it's
[56:37] this age that God is calling out a
[56:39] people after his own namesake in this
[56:43] age in the dark of Ages in the most
[56:46] deceptive of Ages when it's such a
[56:48] deceiving time and lukewarm time when it
[56:51] looks like everybody
[56:53] just look on YouTube one time and it
[56:56] looks like my goodness hillsong's really
[56:58] got the goods or Bethel Music and I'm
[57:00] not taken away from anything that
[57:01] they've got
[57:04] but give them the word test one time
[57:07] they can have their revivals but I want
[57:10] this word Revival
[57:14] [Music]
[57:16] it takes spiritual discernment between
[57:19] to be able to see what is right and what
[57:22] is wrong
[57:24] is that right just take a look at it and
[57:26] it looks so real
[57:28] you look at their worship where did they
[57:30] pattern their worship after you
[57:33] where did they get that inspiration from
[57:36] almighty God what are you channeled
[57:39] under the inspiration of this message
[57:42] it's this inspiration that they're
[57:45] feeding off of
[57:49] I I got some things that that the Lord's
[57:51] laid on my heart and I just want to
[57:52] deliver them so if you can if you can
[57:54] help me Preach Today
[57:56] if you help me preach to me I want to
[57:59] deliver some things that it is in this
[58:01] evil age when God is calling out the
[58:04] elect of this generation
[58:06] out throughout all the ages of the
[58:08] deceit all the way from the Garden of
[58:10] Eden and all the way down this is the
[58:13] most deceptive age that there has been
[58:16] and we notice that it's in this age that
[58:19] hail is spilling itself out into this
[58:22] generation but you remember when brother
[58:24] Bynum is preaching on the junction of
[58:26] time 1956 he said you notice that when
[58:29] all hell is being turned loose all
[58:31] Heaven turns Loose as well so you
[58:33] recognize that heaven is blending in
[58:37] time and with eternity that heaven and
[58:40] Earth are coming together and they are
[58:42] kissing but we recognize that hell
[58:45] itself Isaiah chapter 5 and verse 14
[58:48] tells us that Hell hath enlarged itself
[58:52] [Music]
[58:54] to think that hell is spilling over into
[58:57] this generation
[59:00] it takes real spiritual discernment
[59:03] to recognize what's right and what's
[59:05] wrong you remember when brother Brandon
[59:07] preaches to us in 1963 in Souls that are
[59:10] now in prison and he goes in there
[59:12] brother enemies is coming on he's coming
[59:15] under the message of the third pull he's
[59:16] coming under the ministry of it he
[59:18] recognizes it brother random tells us
[59:20] that he's there in Arizona he's there in
[59:23] Arizona and he he's sitting there doing
[59:25] a little shopping with his wife in
[59:27] JCPenney and he noticed notice now
[59:29] notice where he's sitting at he said I
[59:31] was sitting there at that escalator and
[59:34] he said I let my wife go do a little
[59:36] shopping brothers that's what we do we
[59:38] just let them go do a little shopping
[59:40] even the prophet sat down and he let her
[59:42] go do her shopping and he was sitting
[59:44] there now notice where he was at he was
[59:46] there at that escalator now notice this
[59:49] is one of a kind of an escalator at that
[59:51] time there wasn't too many at that day
[59:53] but notice where it's at he said I was
[59:55] watching them come up and I was watching
[59:57] them go down he said as I was watching
[1:00:00] them he said I'll begin to recognize
[1:00:02] that something was going on he said I
[1:00:05] was sitting there and he said I was
[1:00:07] watching all of those ladies or those
[1:00:09] women coming up there he said they were
[1:00:12] immorally dressed he said had those
[1:00:14] water head haircuts you remember those
[1:00:16] great big balls of things they put on
[1:00:18] top of their head
[1:00:19] thank God we got rid of that I'm not one
[1:00:22] of the kind of those guys that'll preach
[1:00:23] on fans because fans will come and fans
[1:00:26] will go but young people recognize where
[1:00:28] that fad is coming from you don't want
[1:00:31] to look like somebody back in the 70s
[1:00:33] and you'll look at the picture and think
[1:00:34] my God I wish I'd never look like that
[1:00:36] young people if you want to look like
[1:00:39] Conway Twitty it shows that there's
[1:00:41] something wrong with you
[1:00:42] [Applause]
[1:00:44] if you know what I've got the same
[1:00:46] haircut that I've had sister Heather's
[1:00:48] been cutting that hair for for 10 years
[1:00:50] now and I've got the same haircut that
[1:00:53] I've had for the past 10 years and I'll
[1:00:55] probably have the same haircut that I'll
[1:00:57] have all the way till I go into the
[1:00:59] Rapture and it'll be a Timeless thing
[1:01:01] unless I lose this baby
[1:01:04] but you notice young people watch where
[1:01:06] those fads are coming from
[1:01:08] what is it
[1:01:10] is it is something trying to make you
[1:01:12] fashionable like the world
[1:01:14] but you are destined to rise above it
[1:01:16] all but notice he's sitting there and he
[1:01:19] said I recognize that something was
[1:01:21] going on he said I recognize where I was
[1:01:23] he said there I was sitting there
[1:01:26] watching them and he said I begin to see
[1:01:29] them with their cat-eyed glasses coming
[1:01:31] up there and that green stuff underneath
[1:01:34] of their eyes he said there I was
[1:01:36] sitting there in that place he said but
[1:01:39] I was back in hell again when he had
[1:01:43] been shot by his friend at 14 years old
[1:01:45] you remember when he fell down into hell
[1:01:48] and he just kept falling and he said
[1:01:50] there was no end he said A Burning Flame
[1:01:52] would have been a pleasure to that kind
[1:01:54] of place like that and he said there he
[1:01:57] said I watched those women in that
[1:01:59] dimension of hell with those cankered
[1:02:01] eyes you remember brother random thought
[1:02:03] man I needed to go pray for those
[1:02:05] sisters or look at them he thought that
[1:02:08] they had a terrible disease upon them
[1:02:10] he said but I was sitting there watching
[1:02:13] them come up and watching them go down
[1:02:15] and he said there I was
[1:02:19] what was it it was a blending of time
[1:02:22] the blending of Eternity hail was
[1:02:24] spilling itself over setting in this
[1:02:27] place but recognize that hail had done's
[1:02:29] been spilled over
[1:02:31] now think about this now think about
[1:02:33] this here hell has been spilled over
[1:02:36] into this generation and you can see how
[1:02:39] powerful hell is
[1:02:42] one cigarette one rock and roll song one
[1:02:45] little influence of hail you watch it
[1:02:48] you watch the effect of hell that the
[1:02:50] effect that hail had on William Branham
[1:02:53] when he come out of that Vision he was
[1:02:55] so affected by it
[1:02:56] hear him preach the prisoner of Christ
[1:02:58] in 1963 and souls that are now in prison
[1:03:02] he was affected by it but I want you to
[1:03:05] know there was a greater Vision than
[1:03:07] that of hell he had a vision of beyond
[1:03:10] the curtain of time he was under the
[1:03:12] influence of a world
[1:03:16] he said there's not enough words some
[1:03:18] blind wouldn't be doing it wouldn't be
[1:03:20] good enough for it
[1:03:26] Hallelujah whatever you do don't miss
[1:03:30] that place
[1:03:31] it's a place of perfect love what was it
[1:03:34] a prophet in this generation telling you
[1:03:37] that hell has come up but Heaven has
[1:03:39] come down
[1:03:42] and you look at hail it spilled itself
[1:03:44] out into our schools it spilled itself
[1:03:47] over into our homes it spilled itself
[1:03:50] over into our churches and hell was
[1:03:52] trying to get behind the pulpit but if
[1:03:55] hell is that forceful how much more
[1:03:57] forceful is all of heaven and I am an
[1:04:01] ambassador of Christ as Paul would say
[1:04:03] that all of Heaven is backing me up
[1:04:08] all of Heaven is here today
[1:04:12] it has been gathering in this generation
[1:04:15] [Music]
[1:04:21] Satan has done his very best
[1:04:24] to keep the seed of God to getting from
[1:04:26] getting to the water
[1:04:29] because he knows that if you get to the
[1:04:31] water there's nothing he can stop the
[1:04:33] true seed of God from coming to life
[1:04:35] he knows that if he can keep you from
[1:04:37] the inspiration if he can keep you from
[1:04:39] worship if he can keep you from praise
[1:04:41] if he can keep you from the Holy Ghost
[1:04:43] he'll keep you from rising up and
[1:04:45] accepting your healing he's tried his
[1:04:48] best to keep you away from your prayer
[1:04:50] life he's try his best to keep you away
[1:04:52] from the water he's trying his best to
[1:04:54] keep you away from the word but the true
[1:04:56] seed of God has got to rise
[1:04:59] he didn't deposit something on the
[1:05:01] inside of you just to leave it down here
[1:05:03] and lay on us here and let it lay let me
[1:05:06] tell you there is a Resurrection on your
[1:05:08] way and there's no devil in hell there's
[1:05:11] no Spirit of hail there's no demonic
[1:05:13] power that can stop the Church of the
[1:05:15] Living God from rising
[1:05:19] you see Satan is trying to keep you from
[1:05:21] the water because he recognizes that the
[1:05:23] angels on the water
[1:05:26] he recognizes that the angels on the
[1:05:28] water and you may be laying in that spot
[1:05:30] for 38 years but the son of man is
[1:05:32] coming by your way you may have been
[1:05:34] sitting there wondering if this was
[1:05:36] right wondering if it would ever be your
[1:05:38] time but there's going to come one
[1:05:40] Hallelujah that's going to come by your
[1:05:42] way its head rise up take your bed and
[1:05:45] walk
[1:05:46] he's not going to leave you in the same
[1:05:48] spot that he found you in
[1:05:50] this son of man is working in this room
[1:05:53] today rise up
[1:05:55] rise up
[1:06:05] we are fighting a real devil and he
[1:06:07] recognizes what's going on in this room
[1:06:09] right now
[1:06:11] because the son of man has done changed
[1:06:13] he's been changed the atmosphere in here
[1:06:15] and you're very aware of it you know
[1:06:17] good and well that I'm not the one
[1:06:18] talking to you just now but there's
[1:06:20] somebody that is directing me taking me
[1:06:22] to this seat taking me to that seed
[1:06:25] taking me over here what is it it's the
[1:06:28] one that's in control of the water and
[1:06:30] he knows how to come by your way he
[1:06:32] knows how to Circle over your life and
[1:06:35] Satan knows that the Supernatural is
[1:06:37] moving
[1:06:39] he recognizes that the water is stirring
[1:06:42] backwards it's a sign it's a sign that
[1:06:46] the Supernatural is here
[1:06:47] [Music]
[1:06:55] when we was baptized in sister Erica
[1:06:57] sister Genie down there on that river
[1:06:59] that day and Labor Day
[1:07:01] it wasn't a whole lot of people that was
[1:07:03] there but happy was there at that
[1:07:05] baptism
[1:07:06] there's a few of you but we was
[1:07:08] baptizing these sisters and these
[1:07:09] brothers that was there come in for that
[1:07:12] meeting
[1:07:14] me and brother Alan in that water but we
[1:07:16] weren't alone in that water that water
[1:07:18] was churning
[1:07:20] it was turning and it was in a spot
[1:07:23] where there should have been no movement
[1:07:24] in the water it was just a sign that
[1:07:28] this was a supernatural move of the Holy
[1:07:30] Ghost you didn't move by your own accord
[1:07:32] it was a holy spirit drawing
[1:07:41] what does water represent
[1:07:43] it represents people
[1:07:45] and Satan knows when he sees the water
[1:07:47] moving when he sees these people move
[1:07:54] that should have never been moving you
[1:07:56] should have been died you should have
[1:07:58] been dead you should have been gone on
[1:08:00] to the Grave you should have went out
[1:08:01] there to a devil's hail you should have
[1:08:03] been out there with a Creed or a Dogma
[1:08:06] but he recognizes the supernatural was
[1:08:08] on the water and it was calling seeds to
[1:08:10] come up
[1:08:12] he was calling seeds to come up
[1:08:15] the God was predestinated Jesus Christ
[1:08:18] was predestinated just as much as you
[1:08:20] were predestinated to be here and he had
[1:08:23] predestinated 120 seeds
[1:08:26] he predestinated them and they had they
[1:08:29] had the seed but there was no life in
[1:08:32] that seed yet is that right there was no
[1:08:34] life in that seed because the Bible said
[1:08:36] in John chapter 20 verse 20 and 21 that
[1:08:39] Jesus said unto them receive ye the Holy
[1:08:43] Ghost and he breathed on them and said
[1:08:46] receive ye the Holy Ghost now what was
[1:08:49] he doing he
[1:08:51] he was breathing on them the promise the
[1:08:54] inspiration of Acts 2 was coming
[1:08:59] let me tell you and there was nothing
[1:09:02] hell could do to stop that 120 to get in
[1:09:05] that Upper Room brother Brandon said in
[1:09:07] the spoken word is the Original Seed he
[1:09:09] said he went up there he said in those
[1:09:11] seeds he said those seeds gathered
[1:09:14] themselves up
[1:09:20] they gathered themselves up
[1:09:24] and got themselves into that Upper Room
[1:09:27] now what kind of power
[1:09:29] can cause a seed
[1:09:32] a seed that was fearful I see that had
[1:09:35] just been questioned
[1:09:37] I see that it just watched their Messiah
[1:09:39] go to a dead to go to a grave hang on a
[1:09:43] cross
[1:09:45] what were they doing the seed was
[1:09:48] watching
[1:09:50] and it was being unveiled before them
[1:09:52] all that time
[1:09:55] this is him
[1:09:57] and you've been sitting here
[1:09:59] and you've been thinking what is this
[1:10:00] guy caption about it
[1:10:02] what is this what is this ministry all
[1:10:05] about is it even right
[1:10:09] is it even true if there's really some
[1:10:12] power behind it
[1:10:14] if really what this Messiah has said is
[1:10:17] true the things that's got to start
[1:10:19] coming to pass
[1:10:22] let me tell you you can bury my Jesus
[1:10:24] you can lock them in a room and see them
[1:10:26] but let me tell you on third on the
[1:10:28] third day he's gonna get up
[1:10:30] and you can try to hide all of these
[1:10:32] Gene seeds of God inside of all kinds of
[1:10:35] Creeds all kinds of Dogma all kind of
[1:10:38] sin all kind of depression but you gotta
[1:10:41] get up
[1:10:42] you gotta get up because God put
[1:10:44] something on the inside of you and when
[1:10:47] those 120 got themselves up there in
[1:10:50] that Upper Room the water came gushing
[1:10:53] the water came gushing from above and it
[1:10:57] caused them to rise
[1:11:00] what were they rising from they were
[1:11:03] rising from their old nature to a new
[1:11:06] nature
[1:11:08] let me tell you this is his nature
[1:11:12] it's his nature to give out his spirit
[1:11:14] it's his nature to be good to his
[1:11:16] children it's his nature to heal them
[1:11:19] it's his nature to fulfill his promises
[1:11:21] it's his nature to make sure that you
[1:11:24] make it it's his nature
[1:11:28] and you are just as anointed as he is
[1:11:32] Anointed you're just as predestined as
[1:11:34] he was pedestrian
[1:11:43] it's his nature to heal you
[1:11:46] it's just nature to come by your way
[1:11:50] and show you my ways are higher than
[1:11:53] your ways
[1:11:55] my thoughts are higher than your
[1:11:56] thoughts
[1:11:58] you see sometimes we get so Earthbound
[1:12:00] that all we can see is the ground laying
[1:12:02] around us but you don't recognize what
[1:12:04] that ground is doing it's a breeding
[1:12:07] ground for God to raise you up
[1:12:10] brother Ron's troubles brother Andy's
[1:12:13] troubles brother Joe's troubles brother
[1:12:15] Donnie Nicholson's troubles all of your
[1:12:18] troubles that are here what is it to
[1:12:20] Full Gospel Lighthouse it is ground
[1:12:23] for us to rise out of
[1:12:29] some of you come out of some of the most
[1:12:30] stickiest messages
[1:12:32] families broke up
[1:12:34] families torn apart
[1:12:40] you're here
[1:12:43] and the pillar fire is working
[1:12:46] way
[1:12:48] finding where you're at
[1:12:50] looking for you
[1:12:52] he's looking for you
[1:12:58] he knows what he's doing with his word
[1:13:04] every seed has got to bring forth of its
[1:13:05] kind
[1:13:07] if you pray if you plan if you plant a
[1:13:10] Church of Christ seed you're going to
[1:13:12] get a Church of Christ crop
[1:13:13] if you plant a presbyterian seed you're
[1:13:15] going to get a presbyterian crop if you
[1:13:18] plant a Baptist seed you're going to get
[1:13:20] a Baptist crop what has God planted in
[1:13:22] this generation he has planted Gene
[1:13:25] seeds of almighty God you are from the
[1:13:28] beginning I came from God and I'm going
[1:13:31] back to God and when Jesus rose on the
[1:13:34] third day you were in him in germ thorn
[1:13:37] and you were identified with him and his
[1:13:40] death you're identified with him at the
[1:13:42] grave you're identified with him in his
[1:13:44] resurrection and you are identified
[1:13:46] right now as the elect of almighty God
[1:13:50] there is no power of hell that can stop
[1:13:53] the Church of the Living God there is no
[1:13:55] Creed there is no ideology there is no
[1:13:58] intellectualism that can stop the gene
[1:14:01] seed of God from coming forth you are a
[1:14:04] word kind bride
[1:14:07] the word Khan is his kind he made man
[1:14:10] after his own kind
[1:14:12] and he said about David he said he's a
[1:14:15] man after my own heart
[1:14:19] David would say like word have I hid in
[1:14:23] my heart that I would not sin against
[1:14:25] you brother Branham said he said he said
[1:14:29] if David could have had the rain he
[1:14:31] would have been all right but the Holy
[1:14:33] Ghost had not yet been given unto him
[1:14:36] and if David could stand there in Psalms
[1:14:40] chapter 23 it said surely in goodness
[1:14:42] and mercy shall follow me all the days
[1:14:45] of my life you've anointed my head with
[1:14:47] oil my cup runneth over if David without
[1:14:51] the Holy Ghost with David without the
[1:14:53] rain how much more should I cut be
[1:14:56] running over this morning
[1:14:59] oh well we're today
[1:15:03] would you be afraid of the rain
[1:15:07] I pray to God it Reigns in this place
[1:15:11] I play here I pray it rains in this
[1:15:13] place so much that it chokes out your
[1:15:15] ideas that it makes you start gasping to
[1:15:18] get into the ark I pray it rains so much
[1:15:21] in this place you'll get over yourself
[1:15:23] you'll get off of your pity you'll get
[1:15:25] over your idea I pray it rains so much
[1:15:28] that it chokes out your thoughts of what
[1:15:31] God's got to do and this is a box that
[1:15:33] God's got to operate Let It Rain In This
[1:15:36] Place
[1:15:37] [Applause]
[1:15:42] thank you
[1:15:44] we say well brother Andrew
[1:15:47] brother Brandon told us that the rain is
[1:15:49] over he told us that the rain was over
[1:15:51] for the denominations but this is not a
[1:15:54] denominational Reign that is in this
[1:15:55] place this is a holy ghost Reign you
[1:15:58] ain't got to be scared I know there was
[1:16:00] a whole lot of people in the early in
[1:16:02] the early stages of the ministry of
[1:16:03] Malachi 4 when we were first grabbing
[1:16:05] the message we were scared of the latter
[1:16:07] rain Movement we didn't know what it was
[1:16:08] about but they were preaching lateran
[1:16:10] latter rain later rain but what was it
[1:16:13] they were preaching a lot of rain
[1:16:15] movement but they never had the moral
[1:16:17] Reign they didn't have a teaching Reign
[1:16:19] first
[1:16:20] he said but this is the latter rain the
[1:16:24] teaching of Malachi 4 was a rain but
[1:16:27] this is a harvest rain
[1:16:30] don't you recognize we're abroad what's
[1:16:32] been rained out upon you in this
[1:16:34] generation it's a harvest rain it's the
[1:16:36] latter rain
[1:16:38] don't you be scared of that word it's
[1:16:40] exactly what job prophesied that in the
[1:16:43] last days I'll pour out my spirit upon
[1:16:45] All Flesh
[1:16:52] looking for
[1:16:56] remember when brother Brandon's in that
[1:16:58] cave I heard it this morning didn't know
[1:17:00] I didn't know I was going here but this
[1:17:02] is where he's leading me
[1:17:04] I remember the brand I'm talking about
[1:17:06] when he was back here in Mishawaka and
[1:17:07] he saw those two that were under the
[1:17:09] inspiration of Holy Ghost one speaking
[1:17:10] in tongues 100 under interpretation you
[1:17:13] remember that story he said one of them
[1:17:15] was a real Christian and the other one
[1:17:16] he said he had to he had two wives and
[1:17:19] he had two children by this one and that
[1:17:20] one but he looked at him and he was he
[1:17:23] was very concerned about this how can
[1:17:25] this be how can these things be but you
[1:17:27] remember he was up there in his cave and
[1:17:29] he was praying about these things and he
[1:17:31] said I done forgot about it he said I've
[1:17:33] done forgot about it he said mother come
[1:17:35] a win that blew my Bible over to Hebrews
[1:17:38] chapter 6. he said and I wrote it back
[1:17:41] and thought well what's that about and
[1:17:43] he said he got down to pray and he said
[1:17:44] a wind come through there and blew his
[1:17:46] Bible open to Hebrews chapter 6 again he
[1:17:50] said now what is that about and then the
[1:17:52] wind came a third time and blowed his
[1:17:55] Bible open to Hebrews chapter 6. that
[1:17:58] the rain falls on the just and the
[1:18:01] unjust
[1:18:03] that rain was meant for you
[1:18:07] but you've watched that rain if you've
[1:18:09] been paying attention to the news you
[1:18:11] watched that rainfall on Asbury College
[1:18:13] this week what is it it's the reign of
[1:18:16] the Holy Ghost
[1:18:17] it's the reign of the Holy Ghost said
[1:18:19] it's falling but that rain is meant for
[1:18:21] the wheat
[1:18:22] God is not calling a shock God is
[1:18:25] calling a real Gene seed of God he's not
[1:18:28] called him he didn't plant a Pentecostal
[1:18:31] seed he planted a message seed and
[1:18:34] that's exactly what he's going to get
[1:18:35] Bible Believers by a Bible doctrine that
[1:18:39] believe in Bible healing
[1:18:40] [Applause]
[1:18:46] authentic absolutely it's authentic
[1:18:50] but you remember indeed calling through
[1:18:52] the Deep you can go and look at it we'll
[1:18:55] play it before you next weekend show you
[1:18:56] so that you all got it some of you ain't
[1:18:58] got another internet but we're gonna
[1:18:59] play it for him next week on deep
[1:19:01] calling too deep when when brother
[1:19:03] Garber and out here in Harrisonburg is
[1:19:05] the last one standing in that line and
[1:19:07] deep call it to the deep in Washington
[1:19:08] D.C and he said now I see you brother
[1:19:12] random speaking to him he's like I see
[1:19:13] you you're Desiring a Revival for your
[1:19:17] church
[1:19:18] our pastor brother Ron ran into him
[1:19:21] several years several years ago he's
[1:19:24] done died and went on now
[1:19:26] he said if but he wanted to ask him
[1:19:27] about it he wanted to ask him about that
[1:19:30] being in line with brother Branham there
[1:19:32] he said oh he said we had a Revival like
[1:19:35] we never had before
[1:19:37] he said it lasted for two weeks he said
[1:19:39] it went from night to night to the night
[1:19:41] to the night when it kept going on he
[1:19:44] said but when it was over he was over
[1:19:46] and he didn't come back
[1:19:48] but you look at the Revival that is upon
[1:19:51] this broad it's not a dead Revival it's
[1:19:54] not from this church to that church this
[1:19:57] is not a broken cistern that we are
[1:19:59] depending upon local rains of revivals
[1:20:02] we are under a word Revival it's the
[1:20:04] reign of the Holy Ghost we have an
[1:20:07] Artesian well
[1:20:09] we're not drinking from stagnated water
[1:20:12] this seed that he's bringing up is
[1:20:15] destined for the rapture
[1:20:22] Hallelujah
[1:20:25] that's why I'm preaching with everything
[1:20:27] within my might to get our young people
[1:20:29] in this rain to get you in this rain
[1:20:31] there's healing in this rain there's
[1:20:33] power in this rain there's Resurrection
[1:20:36] faith in this rain
[1:20:40] let me tell you a body changes in this
[1:20:42] rain supernatural's in this rain
[1:20:45] [Applause]
[1:20:53] won't you be weary
[1:20:56] would you be wearing
[1:20:58] you're gonna reap
[1:21:01] you planted you planted and you're gonna
[1:21:04] reap
[1:21:06] you planted and you're going to reap
[1:21:09] but you don't know the struggles I'm in
[1:21:10] brother Andrew I don't need to know them
[1:21:13] he don't see the tears that I've cried
[1:21:15] on my pillow wondering is it ever going
[1:21:18] to come by my way I got good news for
[1:21:21] you weeping may endure for a moment but
[1:21:24] joy comes in the morning sister
[1:21:26] Gabrielle Joy is coming in the morning
[1:21:29] this rain is bringing Joy it ain't going
[1:21:32] to bring for the Briar but it'll bring
[1:21:34] for the fern tree it'll bring that which
[1:21:36] God has the positive
[1:21:38] [Applause]
[1:21:41] what was it the message was broadcasted
[1:21:44] and the seed fell on ground
[1:21:48] [Music]
[1:21:54] and you gave it to your friends
[1:21:56] and your friends didn't accept it
[1:21:59] but he's the one that broadcasted it
[1:22:02] knows where it's falling at
[1:22:07] and you look at it think man that's real
[1:22:09] seed right there
[1:22:11] that looks like real genuine seed that
[1:22:13] looks like it
[1:22:15] looks looks like the real thing
[1:22:20] and he go for a spell
[1:22:21] and go for a spell and there's no rain
[1:22:25] that seed that's sitting over here on
[1:22:27] the rock of that seed is sitting over
[1:22:28] here on the ground
[1:22:30] but when the rain comes they both are
[1:22:31] raising up
[1:22:33] and they're screaming for it
[1:22:36] man they can have such a beautiful life
[1:22:37] even have a beautiful dance having such
[1:22:40] an awesome testimony but when the trials
[1:22:42] of Life get heated up on them they can't
[1:22:45] last
[1:22:50] what are you hungering for
[1:22:52] you're hungering for the real water of
[1:22:54] the Holy Ghost
[1:22:56] yeah
[1:22:57] if there ever was a time that we needed
[1:22:59] to bring Jesus a fresh strike of
[1:23:01] Pentecostal water
[1:23:02] it's right now
[1:23:05] what was Rebecca doing
[1:23:07] she didn't know what she was doing
[1:23:09] she didn't understand what that why the
[1:23:12] commission that she was under but she
[1:23:14] was under the prayer
[1:23:16] of a messenger
[1:23:19] why am I watering these camels why am I
[1:23:23] doing it like this it's because there's
[1:23:26] been a prayer prayed over you
[1:23:30] you don't know what you're doing but
[1:23:32] you're watering the very power that is
[1:23:34] going to take you home
[1:23:39] and Satan knows that you're thirsty
[1:23:48] he knows that you're thirsty
[1:23:50] he knows that you're hungry
[1:23:55] you've been hungry for a real move
[1:24:00] you've been hungering for it
[1:24:04] and there ain't nothing like a crime
[1:24:07] of a hungry child
[1:24:09] when a mama hears her baby crying
[1:24:13] I don't know what's in the mama to
[1:24:15] figure that out
[1:24:18] as daddies can think it's it's just it's
[1:24:21] the diaper it needs changing or we need
[1:24:23] to shake a new toy in front of it
[1:24:26] the mama knows that it's hungry
[1:24:28] that Mama's got that
[1:24:31] that Sixth Sense
[1:24:33] she knows and understands that that
[1:24:35] baby's hungry and there's nothing like
[1:24:37] the Cry of a hungry child
[1:24:42] and you watch men that get it on the
[1:24:44] backside of a desert and they get back
[1:24:46] there and they've went without water
[1:24:48] for days without water for hours out
[1:24:51] there in the Heat and they're parched
[1:24:53] and they're they're thirsty their lips
[1:24:55] are so dry they're chapped they're
[1:24:58] thirsting
[1:24:59] and they begin to see things
[1:25:03] what are they seeing they're seeing what
[1:25:05] they think is real water out there
[1:25:07] and it's a mirage
[1:25:09] any of you that's ever drove into heat
[1:25:12] you get to driving down there and that
[1:25:13] heats over top of that pavement
[1:25:15] it's over top of that pavement and it
[1:25:18] creates an illusion in front of you and
[1:25:19] it makes it look like there's real water
[1:25:21] out there
[1:25:22] and you think man I'm going to drive
[1:25:23] straight into straight into a pot of
[1:25:25] water I'm gonna hide the plane but
[1:25:26] there's nothing there but one time there
[1:25:29] was these there was these there was
[1:25:31] these ducks that was flying over and
[1:25:33] they saw this Mirage they saw this
[1:25:35] Mirage and they thought my I'm gonna I
[1:25:37] just we're laying right there on that
[1:25:40] body of water but what they were landing
[1:25:41] on was pavement and they didn't
[1:25:43] recognize but they were looking at a
[1:25:45] mirage and they all when they hit that
[1:25:48] they hit that pavement at the side at
[1:25:50] the same time they disintegrated right
[1:25:52] there because they thought that they was
[1:25:54] hitting water they were used to getting
[1:25:55] in the water but Satan set a pitfall for
[1:25:58] them
[1:25:59] he shot a pitfall for them and make them
[1:26:02] give their life to something that was
[1:26:05] not real and Satan knows what he's doing
[1:26:08] he's trying to trap you trying to bring
[1:26:11] you a false Mirage and make you think
[1:26:15] that you're looking at a reality but the
[1:26:17] souls of men that are predestinated
[1:26:20] shall not go after a false Mirage you
[1:26:23] may have got confused for a moment but
[1:26:25] the water's coming by your way
[1:26:28] tonight
[1:26:30] the Masters heard you call you cried for
[1:26:33] Hunger you cried for a move you cried
[1:26:36] for the Holy Ghost
[1:26:41] you didn't do it
[1:26:44] it was something on the inside of you no
[1:26:47] man can come to the father except by me
[1:26:52] it's my father
[1:26:54] that has drawn me
[1:26:56] as my father has sent me
[1:26:58] so sin now you
[1:27:04] you are going to win
[1:27:07] I'm not looking at the defeated I'm
[1:27:10] looking at the undefeated I'm not
[1:27:12] looking at the unredeemed I'm looking at
[1:27:15] the redeemed I'm not looking at the
[1:27:17] conquered I'm looking at those that are
[1:27:20] the mighty conquerors
[1:27:23] if he got up on the third day you got up
[1:27:26] on the third day if he battled through
[1:27:28] complexes if he battled through scars if
[1:27:31] he battled through it
[1:27:32] it's a sign that you can battle through
[1:27:35] it
[1:27:37] come on now come on now you got all of
[1:27:41] this going on around you don't you be
[1:27:44] wary about it
[1:27:45] look at this look at that don't you be
[1:27:48] wary about it
[1:27:49] [Applause]
[1:27:53] these weights are higher than your ways
[1:27:54] your ways wouldn't even get you out of
[1:27:57] the ground
[1:27:58] and you think that you control literal
[1:28:00] you
[1:28:02] but your ways have led you straight to
[1:28:04] destruction
[1:28:06] hear your ways LED you to Rebellion but
[1:28:09] his ways LED you to forgiveness
[1:28:12] your ways LED you to a devil's hair but
[1:28:14] his way took you to a heaven
[1:28:18] to a bar your ways took you to the end
[1:28:21] of the bottle but
[1:28:22] wage takes you by stimulation to
[1:28:24] revelation
[1:28:33] so is it real
[1:28:35] what's going out there in the world it's
[1:28:37] the rain
[1:28:42] but don't get confused
[1:28:46] don't get confused because you see this
[1:28:48] one go astray and you've seen that one
[1:28:51] go astray
[1:28:52] and you thought ma they were as a real
[1:28:53] brother they was a real sister
[1:28:56] and the rain fell on them and my they
[1:28:59] they sure enjoyed the presence of the
[1:29:02] Lord
[1:29:05] that just easily walk away
[1:29:11] a rare devotion just uh just a week ago
[1:29:15] or so
[1:29:17] and there was a there was a lady that
[1:29:19] had a dream had a dream and and the
[1:29:21] dream there was there was three sisters
[1:29:23] that were that were laid out that were
[1:29:26] sitting down and they were praying
[1:29:28] and the lady watching a dream she she
[1:29:31] watched
[1:29:32] as Jesus come behind all of these
[1:29:34] sisters as they were down praying
[1:29:36] and Jesus took his time
[1:29:40] with this one
[1:29:41] he took so much of his time
[1:29:44] and he really spent some time with her
[1:29:48] then then it goes on to the next one
[1:29:51] and Jesus didn't spend as much time with
[1:29:53] her but he spent some real time
[1:29:55] but when it come to the last one
[1:29:57] he just walked right past her
[1:30:00] and she thought
[1:30:03] does he not care about me
[1:30:06] he cared about them
[1:30:08] and she had all of these things in her
[1:30:10] mind like does he really love me he
[1:30:13] spent so much time with them
[1:30:15] he spent so much time with them but he
[1:30:18] didn't take the time to stop by my way
[1:30:22] and then Jesus turned to her and said
[1:30:25] I knew that you had faith
[1:30:28] and that you was going to make it
[1:30:33] these other sisters they needed more
[1:30:35] time with me but you've already spent so
[1:30:38] much time with me you knew how to win
[1:30:43] and it looks like God's overlooked you
[1:30:47] and it looks like he ain't spending this
[1:30:48] time but don't you recognize that he's
[1:30:51] been there all the time you didn't just
[1:30:53] start this journey yesterday but you
[1:30:55] started many years ago
[1:30:57] he knows how much time you need with him
[1:31:00] he knows what you need in this life
[1:31:09] if David was a man after his kind
[1:31:13] what ought we to be
[1:31:16] if he made man after his own image and
[1:31:19] that was his kind which was it it was
[1:31:21] flesh he made him flesh and what was it
[1:31:25] when Jesus came he was the royal Seed of
[1:31:28] Abraham what was it he was not so much
[1:31:31] yes he was there in the fleshly but not
[1:31:33] so much he was of the faith of Abraham
[1:31:36] he was of the faith of Abraham and you
[1:31:39] look that when Abraham he stood against
[1:31:41] every circumstance against every
[1:31:44] circumstance and Against All Odds
[1:31:46] Abraham believed notice when Jesus came
[1:31:51] he was of the Seed Faith of Abraham and
[1:31:55] notice what the Bible says in Galatians
[1:31:57] chapter 3 and verse 29 that if ye be in
[1:32:01] Christ then are you Abraham's seeds and
[1:32:04] heirs according to the promise so you
[1:32:07] are a children of the promise today you
[1:32:11] are the Original Seed you are the spoken
[1:32:13] word you wouldn't be here Mary
[1:32:17] I didn't Destin you to be here you're a
[1:32:19] virgin into nature your virgin in your
[1:32:22] soul you didn't take after some
[1:32:24] man-made's idea
[1:32:26] Lord
[1:32:29] tell you what I could just take off
[1:32:31] speaking in tongues right now you are
[1:32:33] the spoken word you are gonna rise
[1:32:35] you're not gonna fail you're not gonna
[1:32:38] be defeated you're not going to go into
[1:32:40] tribulation the Rapture is yours
[1:32:44] you are the Royal Seed of Abraham
[1:32:49] Hallelujah
[1:32:52] you're going to make it we know his
[1:32:54] language brother Daisy he can't leave us
[1:32:57] here they put something on the inside of
[1:32:59] us
[1:32:59] [Applause]
[1:33:05] some seed just needs a little bit more
[1:33:07] room to grow
[1:33:11] you think my goodness
[1:33:12] my goodness that brother that brother
[1:33:14] Shannon
[1:33:16] he sure is he sure is all over the place
[1:33:19] he needs a lot of room to grow

[1:33:25] producing for him and sister Jenny but
[1:33:27] he's got a family he needs a lot of room
[1:33:30] he needs a lot of room I don't know
[1:33:31] where you are right now in your
[1:33:33] spiritual walk but I believe that you
[1:33:35] ought to make some room if you want to
[1:33:37] get that seed good and buried you got to
[1:33:39] make some room for it get it down in
[1:33:41] there and make sure that no devil in
[1:33:43] hell can be able to get it out when you
[1:33:45] plant this seed on the inside of Jesus
[1:33:47] there's no devil in hell that can get it
[1:33:50] out of Jesus and when Jesus calls for it
[1:33:52] there's nothing going to stop it from
[1:33:54] coming up
[1:33:56] thank you
[1:33:57] hallelujah what are we to be born of his
[1:34:00] bone life of his life power of his power
[1:34:03] under the same anointing what are we
[1:34:05] under we're not just under an Acts 2
[1:34:07] anointing we're under the anointing of
[1:34:10] the mighty angel
[1:34:15] what are you doing what are you doing
[1:34:17] I'm making room because God's got some
[1:34:20] seeds that's coming and I don't know who
[1:34:23] is and I don't know who ate I'm just
[1:34:25] preaching the gospel and when it falls
[1:34:27] it's going to fall on good ground and
[1:34:30] when God goes to calling it and he sends
[1:34:33] the water upon it
[1:34:35] don't you be scared you just go ahead
[1:34:37] and enter in well you said well I can't
[1:34:38] dance like sister Katie I can't speak in
[1:34:41] tongues like sister Julia I can't get
[1:34:43] emotional like this one that or the
[1:34:44] other one I don't care if you can only
[1:34:45] move your finger move your finger but
[1:34:48] don't you be scared of the water it's
[1:34:50] what's gonna bring you up
[1:34:54] the heavens are pouring out I don't know
[1:34:56] if you recognize but in this room today
[1:34:58] are angels that are overcharged of every
[1:35:01] one of these seeds
[1:35:03] thank you
[1:35:07] and Satan that slick one
[1:35:12] slick one under that black cloak it's
[1:35:16] trying to go out there and sow seeds of
[1:35:17] discrepancy
[1:35:20] trying to choke out your faith trying to
[1:35:22] choke out your joy trying to give you
[1:35:24] all kinds of a depression and things
[1:35:26] that man has created what is it it's a
[1:35:29] devil
[1:35:30] but you see you are not a hybridized
[1:35:33] seed
[1:35:34] you have a thoroughbred you have a
[1:35:36] pedigree you know who you are you don't
[1:35:38] have spiritual Amnesia you've been cold
[1:35:41] under this generation This is the End
[1:35:44] Time seed that rises under the evening
[1:35:46] light

[1:36:04] I want you to know
[1:36:07] that you will be surprised who's going
[1:36:10] to be there
[1:36:15] God is not going to be surprised
[1:36:17] and who's going to be there but you will
[1:36:21] I prayed for them and it looked like
[1:36:23] they was never coming don't you worry
[1:36:25] you might be surprised they might come
[1:36:27] in at the last hour but they're going to
[1:36:29] get the same reward that you get they're
[1:36:32] going to get the same holy ghost that
[1:36:34] you got if they're going to be there
[1:36:36] they've got to come under the same rain
[1:36:38] [Applause]
[1:36:52] God didn't leave me this way for no
[1:36:55] reason
[1:37:02] you've been through hell
[1:37:06] just to be in this service
[1:37:12] you think about brother Ron
[1:37:15] we do our very best to keep you from
[1:37:17] seeing everything that goes on
[1:37:19] a lot of times he's throwing up before
[1:37:21] he walks behind this pulpit
[1:37:25] a lot of times you would say he's going
[1:37:26] through hell on Earth just to get into
[1:37:28] the pulpit
[1:37:29] foreign
[1:37:31] and these are his words
[1:37:35] let me just give you a little insight
[1:37:36] real quick so that maybe you'll
[1:37:38] appreciate it just a little bit deeper
[1:37:42] I'm ready
[1:37:44] at all times in case brother Ron gets
[1:37:46] sick
[1:37:47] and I'll take the pulpit and you'll
[1:37:49] never know the difference
[1:37:52] but one day he come and he was so sick
[1:37:55] he
[1:37:55] I know he I know he threw up eight times
[1:37:58] that day
[1:37:59] I said Dad I'm taking a day
[1:38:01] I'm taking a day you're you're just too
[1:38:03] weak he said no Andrew
[1:38:08] he said if I let Satan whip me with this

[1:47:34] false doctrines that you got yourself
[1:47:35] into the roads that you went down
[1:47:39] and it didn't look like there was no way
[1:47:40] but I want you to know that my God knows
[1:47:42] how to make a highway out of a sea

[1:48:30] I was just having Communications with
[1:48:32] him
[1:48:34] house
[1:48:42] but all of a sudden
[1:48:45] he hears a voice
[1:48:48] and you've heard this voice before
[1:48:53] you heard it when you were a little
[1:48:54] child
[1:48:57] and you thought
[1:48:58] it's been so long
[1:49:01] since I've heard his voice

[1:49:46] sister Cassie
[1:49:48] laughs
[1:49:50] in the Brethren Church
[1:49:52] and she was seeking more of the Holy
[1:49:54] Ghost and she went before the Elders of
[1:49:56] that church said she was wanting more
[1:49:58] and they said they couldn't they didn't
[1:49:59] know anything higher than just being
[1:50:00] baptized
[1:50:04] but something on the inside
[1:50:08] so you can come higher
[1:50:10] you can come higher
[1:50:12] you can come higher Lazarus you are not
[1:50:15] destined for the grave you were destined

[1:50:25] Timmy come forth you were put here for
[1:50:29] this Sage for this generation come forth
[1:50:38] this foolish has so much power
[1:50:42] that William Branham said that if he
[1:50:44] wouldn't have called Lazarus his name it
[1:50:47] would have caused a general Resurrection
[1:50:49] the voice of Resurrection is in this
[1:50:52] body and it's calling you to come up
[1:50:55] higher

[1:51:42] forth
[1:51:43] of its kind
[1:51:46] it shall not return unto him void
[1:51:48] but it shall accomplish that which he

[1:52:07] Victor so that you can rise in Victory
[1:52:09] [Applause]
[1:52:10] it may look like defeat but he rose up
[1:52:14] past the undefeated
[1:52:16] and what you've been diagnosed with as I
[1:52:18] told you last week is not a verdict
[1:52:22] it is your way to get yourself out of
[1:52:24] trouble it's your hour to shine and to
[1:52:28] prove that God is still the same
[1:52:29] yesterday today and forever and it may
[1:52:32] look like the weapons that are formed
[1:52:34] against you are going to prosper but
[1:52:36] remember they shall not Prosper after
[1:52:39] this Revelation that has struck your
[1:52:41] heart today you ought to be able to say
[1:52:43] if God before me who can be against me
[1:52:47] I want to tell you you're as assured to
[1:52:50] win the victory as Joshua was assured to
[1:52:53] win a victory
[1:52:54] when when Moses commanded Joshua to go
[1:52:58] out there
[1:53:02] I'm in Exodus 17 he should destroy them
[1:53:05] and I'll stand up here on top of this
[1:53:07] mountain and I'll make sure that you win
[1:53:10] and when Moses was holding up his Rod as
[1:53:13] long as he was holding up his Rod Joshua
[1:53:16] was winning the battle but when his arms
[1:53:18] got tired
[1:53:20] arms sank down and Joshua begin to lose
[1:53:23] the battle but then there came Aaron and
[1:53:26] his sister and they held up Moses hand
[1:53:28] and if there ever was a time to hold up
[1:53:31] the hands of the message
[1:53:33] each time that we put our hands
[1:53:34] underneath this message
[1:53:36] [Music]
[1:53:39] that Jesus was sold under the commission
[1:53:42] to make sure that you won the victory he
[1:53:45] allowed those Roman jailers those Roman
[1:53:48] soldiers to tack his hands upon the
[1:53:50] cross
[1:53:52] [Music]
[1:53:55] upon the cross

[1:54:00] [Music]
[1:54:05] you are going to win look at it you
[1:54:08] can't get his hands down
[1:54:11] he wanted to make sure that you knew
[1:54:13] that you were going to win so we allowed
[1:54:16] the ones that crucified him to nail his
[1:54:19] hands up there for a sign to the rest of
[1:54:22] the world that my pride will be
[1:54:26] victorious
[1:54:27] [Music]
[1:54:37] blessed be the name of the Lord why
[1:54:40] don't you give him praise
[1:54:42] [Music]

[1:55:38] generation to condemn every Power of
[1:55:40] hell
[1:55:41] Smith Wiggles worth one time heard of a
[1:55:45] woman that had tumors throughout her
[1:55:47] body and he went there with another
[1:55:48] brother by the name of brother Fisher he
[1:55:51] went there into that room and there was
[1:55:53] a lady that was that was that was almost
[1:55:55] gone
[1:55:57] and he said he began to speak to her
[1:55:59] this lady with those tumors who had her
[1:56:01] body he said Do You Believe Me
[1:56:04] you believe the Lord Do You Believe on
[1:56:06] it but she couldn't even speak she was
[1:56:08] so far gone all she could do was move
[1:56:09] her finger
[1:56:12] Smith Wigglesworth was told by his
[1:56:15] friend said it's too late she's done
[1:56:16] gone but Smith Wigglesworth took this
[1:56:19] corpse of a body lifeless of a body
[1:56:22] stood her up against a wardrobe carried
[1:56:25] her over against that wardrobe
[1:56:27] and said Satan come out in the name of
[1:56:30] Jesus Christ and walk
[1:56:34] he said little like a he said like a
[1:56:36] dime leaf or he said like a dying tree
[1:56:39] he said leave after Leaf after Leaf
[1:56:41] started falling off of her body and she
[1:56:44] began to walk
[1:56:45] I should begin to prophesy I should
[1:56:47] begin to walk I completely was healed
[1:56:49] right there Smith wiggle's word said
[1:56:52] that he was telling that in a service
[1:56:54] kind of like this
[1:56:56] he said he was telling me and he said
[1:56:57] when I begin to tell that a doctor stood
[1:56:59] up said that's nothing but the truth he
[1:57:02] said I examine that woman and that woman
[1:57:04] said there I was there I was up in
[1:57:08] heaven and she said there was a number
[1:57:10] an unnumberable number of saints and
[1:57:13] angels that were gathered around she
[1:57:15] said but all of a sudden I heard my name
[1:57:17] saying walk in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:57:20] and I was back in that Dimension again
[1:57:22] if Smith Wigglesworth could operate
[1:57:25] under that in the man age
[1:57:27] how much more should we operate under
[1:57:30] the ego anointing

[1:58:06] mind that is in you was in Christ Jesus
[1:58:08] and it's working all the way down
[1:58:10] through its members this is not a body
[1:58:13] of concrete where the word's fallen on
[1:58:15] it and the words falling off this is a
[1:58:17] body of Flesh and when the head says
[1:58:19] move the body's moving
[1:58:21] [Music]

[2:01:15] rise rise under the auspices of this
[2:01:18] message and accept
[2:01:24] Hallelujah come on somebody why don't
[2:01:28] you lift up your voice and why don't you
[2:01:31] begin to prophesy why don't you begin to
[2:01:33] speak it's turning your mouth loose time

[2:01:39] why don't you call on brother Randy's
[2:01:40] name why don't you call Brother Ron's
[2:01:42] name we say well I ain't got necessarily
[2:01:44] anything anything too big in my life
[2:01:46] right now we are a body and if one
[2:01:48] person's hurting the whole body's hurt
[2:01:50] let's call on these needs let's call on
[2:01:53] the name of Jesus Christ and let's defy
[2:01:56] every devil
[2:01:57] father God I come before you in the name
[2:02:00] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:02:02] I recognize that we are in the
[2:02:04] atmosphere of the supernatural just now
[2:02:06] I recognize how
[2:02:09] I set up this moment in this time in
[2:02:12] this generation for us to allow our
[2:02:14] faith to rise
[2:02:16] rise out of the Dust of the Earth
[2:02:19] rise to believe that all things are
[2:02:21] possible to them that belief I'm not
[2:02:23] preaching to them something of days gone
[2:02:25] by I'm not preaching to them something
[2:02:27] that they can't do I'm trying to just
[2:02:29] teach them and tell them
[2:02:31] this is their doing this is their word
[2:02:37] I believe with all my heart that in a
[2:02:40] moment
[2:02:44] you can put it in my hands
[2:02:48] you can put it in my mouth
[2:02:49] you can change situations
[2:02:52] you've already determined courses right
[2:02:54] here this morning and people are making
[2:02:56] their decision right here as this prayer
[2:02:58] is going forth what they're going to
[2:03:00] decide to do in life and father we chose
[2:03:04] the way with your despised for you
[2:03:07] father the world don't want your kind
[2:03:10] but it's the only kind that the world
[2:03:13] can bring forth It's a word of God the
[2:03:15] world don't want none of them to act too
[2:03:17] screaming blabbering hollering screaming
[2:03:20] miserable creatures that they are but
[2:03:23] it's the only kind that you can bring
[2:03:25] forth father
[2:03:28] we begin to turn our mouth loose for
[2:03:31] brother Randy we ask father you touch
[2:03:34] his body Lord let there be a
[2:03:36] supernatural charge of the Holy Ghost
[2:03:38] that's pulsating in this room father
[2:03:41] we've got representation by
[2:03:42] predestination and father we recognize
[2:03:45] it's not my word but it's your word when
[2:03:48] I begin to speak in your name it's just
[2:03:51] like you begin to speak
[2:03:53] your word father if hell's trying to
[2:03:57] stop us if he was trying to keep us from
[2:03:59] this how much more are you trying to get
[2:04:02] us to go more than just Joy more than
[2:04:06] just shouting more than just a
[2:04:08] manifestation of gifts but our
[2:04:10] outpouring of the Holy Ghost more than
[2:04:13] an anointing but a seal of the Holy
[2:04:15] Ghost
[2:04:18] oh God
[2:04:19] I pray right now
[2:04:22] and worshipers would arise

[2:04:49] Hell somebody's going to rise up and say
[2:04:52] yes to the word of God somebody's going
[2:04:54] to rise up and say I believe it when
