[5:53] look at our front yard and so they
[5:55] should be here tomorrow to do that god
[5:58] bless you if you'll turn with me to
[6:00] Matthew chapter 13 this afternoon in
[6:05] verse 2 and the great multitudes were
[6:14] gathered together unto him so that he
[6:17] went into a ship and sat and the whole
[6:19] multitude stood on the shore and many
[6:24] things and he spake many things unto
[6:27] them in parables saying behold a sower
[6:30] went forth to sow and when he had sowed
[6:34] some fell on the son fell by the way
[6:37] side and the fowls came and devoured
[6:40] them up and some fell on stony places
[6:43] and where they had not much earth
[6:47] forthwith they sprung up because they
[6:50] had no deepness of the earth and when
[6:54] the Sun was up they were scorched
[6:56] because they had no root and they
[6:58] withered away and some fell among thorns
[7:02] and and the thorns sprung up and choked
[7:04] them I want to be this next part but
[7:09] either fell into good ground and brought
[7:11] forth fruit some a hundredfold and some
[7:16] sixty and some thirty fold who hath ears
[7:21] to hear let him hear
[7:25] and the disciples came and said unto Him
[7:28] why speakest thou unto them in parables
[7:29] and he answered and said unto them
[7:32] because it is given unto you two though
[7:36] the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven
[7:39] but to them it is not given I'm glad to
[7:44] be a part of that to them that fell on
[7:46] good ground maybe you have a need
[7:48] tonight you just like to lift it before
[7:49] the Lord this evening
[7:51] Almighty God how we love you with all of
[7:53] our hearts tonight and we're thankful to
[7:56] be in your house this afternoon and we
[7:58] took a vote we voted for you tonight and
[8:01] I ask you tonight that you would just
[8:04] come and anoint our lips and our words
[8:06] Lord Jesus come and bless this audience
[8:09] there's many needs that are among us and
[8:11] Lord we just pray that you'd send your
[8:13] word and heal them this evening Lord
[8:16] Lord I just asked you that you would
[8:18] guide our thoughts like a laser-guided
[8:21] missile to the place that it needs to go
[8:24] Lord now not just not just the speaker
[8:27] but I ask you to anoint the ears of the
[8:30] hearer and Lord as we respond to the
[8:33] Word of God may we may we pull on you to
[8:37] get what we have need of this evening in
[8:39] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and
[8:42] amen you may be seated
[8:50] whenever we bill with harvest has been
[8:53] the bride of Jesus Christ we we just
[8:55] cannot help ourselves unless we go to
[8:57] the Book of Ruth Ruth chapter 2 and
[9:01] verse 4 we find her in Boaz is filled
[9:04] yet some interesting instructions that I
[9:06] want to remind you of before we go too
[9:08] far and Boaz came and from came from
[9:12] Bethlehem and said unto the Reapers the
[9:15] Lord be with you and they answered him
[9:18] the Lord blessed thee and then said Boaz
[9:22] unto his servant and said over the
[9:24] Reapers whose damsel is this and the
[9:29] servant that was said over the Reapers
[9:31] answer said is the Moabite us damsel
[9:35] that came back with Naomi out of the
[9:37] country
[9:38] Moab now remember they thought she was a
[9:41] cursed person and she said I pray you
[9:47] let me glean and gather after the
[9:50] Reapers amongst the sheaves and so she
[9:53] came and and continued even from the
[9:56] morning until now and she tarried a
[9:59] little in the house and then said
[10:02] Boasson to Ruth Harrison now not my
[10:07] daughter
[10:08] notice these instructions go not to
[10:11] glean in another field neither go from
[10:17] hiss from hence but abide here fast by
[10:22] my maidens I love those instructions
[10:26] don't go to another field you stay in my
[10:30] field let thine eyes be on the field
[10:34] that they do reap and go after them
[10:37] having not charged the young men that
[10:40] that they shall not touch thee when thou
[10:43] art a thirst go to the vessels and drink
[10:45] of of that which the young men have
[10:48] drawn did she fell on her face and bowed
[10:51] herself to the ground and said unto him
[10:54] why have I found Grace and Dinah eyes
[10:56] that thou should has take knowledge of
[10:59] me saying I'm a stranger and then Boaz
[11:02] answered and said unto her it hadn't
[11:04] been fully been showed me all that thou
[11:08] has done and to thy mother law sister
[11:11] death of thine husband and how that thou
[11:14] has left thy father and thy mother and
[11:16] the land of Nativity and and her come to
[11:20] a people which which thou knewest not
[11:23] heretofore notice these next words the
[11:27] Lord recompense by work he's a good
[11:34] reckon keeper
[11:36] and a full reward be given Dean of the
[11:40] Lord God of Israel under whose wings
[11:44] thou art come to trust can I read that
[11:52] last verse and you read it with me the
[11:55] Lord recompense thy work and a full
[11:59] reward be given thee of the Lord God of
[12:02] Israel under whose wings thou art come
[12:07] to trust now we realize that we're at
[12:16] harvest time we can look around a little
[12:19] bit and anybody's got any common sense
[12:21] can realize that as we we are not in the
[12:24] planting season but we're beginning to
[12:28] see the combines as they are beginning
[12:30] to go through the field you don't do
[12:32] that in the jewel hour up in June that's
[12:36] the time to word you watch it at one
[12:39] time there was a there was a seeds in a
[12:42] farmers hands certified seeds that they
[12:47] would reproduce themselves now if you
[12:51] kept them they can't reproduce if you
[12:54] just keep them in a sack or and keep
[12:55] them in a bin they'll never reproduce
[12:58] themselves but under the right
[13:00] atmosphere and the right conditions and
[13:03] planted in the right ground that is that
[13:05] is just ready it given time and
[13:09] conditions will reproduce itself again
[13:14] but the random would ask them would say
[13:17] these words he says now if you would ask
[13:19] me to give you an oak tree I'd give you
[13:23] an acre I'd give you an acre it has the
[13:29] potential to be an oak tree great
[13:33] questions is ask you know it's easy to
[13:37] count the seeds in an apple but it's
[13:41] impossible to count the apples inside of
[13:46] the seed
[13:46] [Music]
[13:50] are you with me
[13:52] just to look at some of you just to look
[13:57] at where you came from God knew what he
[14:02] deposited on the inside of you before
[14:05] the foundation of the world now we look
[14:13] around a little bit we can sense the
[14:16] change we can sense where we've come
[14:19] from we can sense that we're not in the
[14:22] days of preaching God sent us Elijah now
[14:27] we did that for decades God sent us
[14:29] Elijah Elijah has come and we preach to
[14:33] Elijah was and we we preach the the the
[14:38] the initial doctrines of the message and
[14:41] we had to lay them down in order for
[14:43] absolute years what was that that was a
[14:47] calling out of her my people there was a
[14:50] gathering that took place it was
[14:53] gathering out of denominations gathering
[14:56] out of the world now let me just say you
[14:59] didn't come to hear a man's voice a man
[15:03] didn't draw you to that it was God
[15:06] himself
[15:07] the Lord of the harvest you heard the
[15:12] voice that's behind the voice has it
[15:15] begin to call to you like a deep calling
[15:19] to the deep maybe you walked into the
[15:24] building for the first time and you said
[15:25] now this is different now this is
[15:29] different maybe you walked in here and
[15:31] you felt for the first time in your life
[15:33] I'm at home I'm at home this is a place
[15:41] to work and be a refuge for me and and I
[15:44] and from the storms of life I can come
[15:46] here and and I can worship God and I can
[15:49] feel free to worship God you see if the
[15:53] harvest it's a time to where that the
[15:56] wind can blow through the wheat
[15:59] and it can glorify on the siege stand
[16:02] out and they can worship in Liberty
[16:07] they're not bound up but they can
[16:08] worship in Liberty they're not hidden in
[16:13] the ground no longer or in the stalk or
[16:15] in the tassel but they're the seed has
[16:18] become seed again it's reproduced itself
[16:22] by the brilliance so what was once
[16:28] captured by a prophet of God and as he
[16:32] begin to speak the word brother Brandon
[16:34] would explain it to us in the first seal
[16:36] how that he would go catch the mysteries
[16:39] and then bring it to the people or he
[16:43] with me now and we've been we've been
[16:45] enjoying that word as this winter for
[16:49] decades now let's watch them reel to
[16:52] reel then on books and then it became
[16:55] unknown unknown higher levels of
[16:57] technology to where we've got it at our
[16:59] fingertips anymore but you see the work
[17:03] is the rapid the rapid production of
[17:06] harvests has come to a season to where
[17:08] we realize time is really of the essence
[17:11] now I'm getting ready to go to Canada
[17:15] hearing and there they're preparing
[17:18] there will be people that will miss the
[17:20] services because of they have huge farms
[17:23] and just thousands of acre farms and so
[17:27] it's critical that that harvest come in
[17:30] when it's just right it can't be too
[17:35] moist and it can't be too dry and so it
[17:40] has to be just right
[17:42] now the rapture will be right on season
[17:48] now to some it looks like it's been a
[17:51] great delay and it's way over time let
[17:53] me just say God's always on time are you
[17:59] with me as with those lashes he was on
[18:01] time he was perfectly on time he will
[18:05] always be on time for you too because
[18:11] remember he's the father he knows the
[18:14] best he is the administrator or the
[18:17] Redeemer he is over top of the
[18:21] redemption he will do the work
[18:26] Naomi told Ruth you know the work we
[18:32] realize this we have what we have
[18:35] preached for for for so long we have
[18:38] started stood with great energies we're
[18:41] now witnessing among us thought about
[18:44] the energy but it was in this building
[18:46] last weekend you could feel it when you
[18:50] turned up on the hill you literally
[18:54] could feel it and you could feel it as
[18:56] the week started getting closer and
[18:58] closer you could just feel almost like a
[19:00] pressure almost like an overwhelming joy
[19:03] has it begin to come and the meetings
[19:06] were excited and some of you said in
[19:10] your seats for two hours before service
[19:13] you can't tell me you don't love God
[19:16] because it's more than just for a seat
[19:23] but the Branham says we come to weave he
[19:27] says now any Mason can lay block it
[19:32] takes a master stonemason to turn a
[19:35] corner I'd say we've turned the corner
[19:41] we've witnessed the book of Acts among
[19:43] us I'd like to say this you it's a sin
[19:47] for us now to disbelieve we've seen
[19:50] every gift we've seen miracles take
[19:53] place among us that are phenomenal even
[19:55] breathtaking
[19:58] under this administration of this egg's
[20:01] were not being we have not been preached
[20:03] to by a reformer we have not been
[20:07] reproached to buy some theologian but
[20:10] God took a man and hid himself behind
[20:15] him
[20:19] Revelation chapter city and says and I
[20:23] saw another mighty angel come down from
[20:27] heaven clothed with a cloud and a
[20:30] rainbow butts upon his head and his face
[20:32] were as it were the Sun and his feet his
[20:34] pillars of fire and he had in his hand a
[20:37] little book open and he set his right
[20:40] foot upon the sea and his left foot upon
[20:43] the earth now let's just remember
[20:48] remember this the enemy has always stood
[20:54] near when the word is being made
[20:58] manifested when God was creating the
[21:05] heavens and the earth the enemy was near
[21:08] watching him when he was doing it how do
[21:14] you know that brother rung remember when
[21:16] he came and when he spoke everything
[21:19] into existence and then when he broke
[21:24] that chain and he made out of the atom
[21:29] ax and took a rib and created a wife
[21:32] mother Eve Satan was standing real near
[21:37] so he knew he had a link when Jesus is
[21:43] standing there
[21:44] Satan was very near he's always been
[21:50] critical of the written word because he
[21:52] can always work and discombobulate it
[21:55] but he has great trouble when the word
[21:58] is manifested
[22:00] and the word being manifested always
[22:03] defeats him that's why you are so
[22:08] dangerous to the devil you see you're
[22:19] more than a book or a tape or a picture
[22:21] on the wall or a myth but you're the
[22:24] living realities of God and you're being
[22:30] a living epistle of this age defeats
[22:33] devil the devil at any place and at any
[22:36] time under any condition now we're in a
[22:47] season we must declare this and no man
[22:50] is in charge of this this is not we're
[22:55] not looking to a man we're looking to
[22:58] Jesus Christ the author and the finisher
[23:01] of our faith now remember this what he
[23:07] has promised he will fulfill I want you
[23:14] to grab that that's important what he
[23:16] has promised he will fulfill where can I
[23:24] rest my hope and work and I rest my
[23:26] faith in him remember he has
[23:32] resurrection power he said he was the
[23:35] only man that could ever say I had power
[23:38] to lay my life down and the power to
[23:43] take it up again
[23:46] but remember he also said the corn of
[23:49] wheat must go into the ground and die
[23:51] there it must rot and it may have looked
[23:55] like maybe for hundreds of years what
[23:57] was God doing and the critics might have
[24:01] stood off and thought what about Marius
[24:03] God what was he doing he was putting his
[24:06] seed into the ground but if you could
[24:11] only look at her in the house
[24:14] she's risen in power she's risen in
[24:18] faith are you with me I'm absolutely
[24:27] overwhelmed when I think about what even
[24:30] men in Columbus Day and arrhenius day
[24:33] their deacons their trustees their men
[24:36] of faith people that serve God with them
[24:39] God not only made their messenger a
[24:41] promise he made them overcomers of that
[24:44] day of promise on that Resurrection Day
[24:50] are you with me
[24:51] the scripture says wherefore comfort one
[24:55] another with these words
[24:59] he promises a resurrection now we get in
[25:05] a hurry a lot of times but you remember
[25:06] God promised that he was going to send a
[25:08] deliverer to Egypt and Joseph said don't
[25:12] you bury my bones down in here so no
[25:15] matter how bad a day that they had they
[25:18] would go by the tomb of where Joseph was
[25:20] that in that lead coffin and they lay
[25:23] their hands over on that coffin because
[25:26] they knew God made a promise and Joseph
[25:29] said don't burry me are you with me
[25:31] don't burn me down here in Egypt but
[25:34] when you go across you carry my bones
[25:37] across there because in that land
[25:40] there's going to come a resurrection
[25:43] Joseph knew that he had to be buried
[25:45] where Jesus was gonna race again hello
[25:54] God also made in Israel promised in this
[25:57] day God's doing a couple of different
[26:01] things at the same time he has raised
[26:04] the Gentile bride to the end Tom calling
[26:09] bringing her to rapturing condition but
[26:12] he has not neglected his word with
[26:14] Israel and he has gathered them from all
[26:18] realms of the earth and brought them
[26:21] back home
[26:25] now the same God that's made us a
[26:27] promise he made them a promise
[26:33] brother Vernon I was thinking about when
[26:35] I come to this note this evening I
[26:37] believe if I have this right you were in
[26:40] brother branham's meetings as a boy and
[26:42] in the earth in the 50s in about 58 we
[26:45] went with your father am i right on that
[26:50] there are others that have been here in
[26:52] the past that that were in that meeting
[26:55] it was one of your cousins that would
[26:58] actually believe he's a cousin to yours
[26:59] that would help orchestrate that meeting
[27:02] he was also a friend of of brother Carl
[27:06] Williams now III want you to understand
[27:10] God made a promise to this generation he
[27:16] made a promise to this generation he
[27:23] made a promise to us and we've come to
[27:27] the season of harvest are you with me
[27:33] now remember we must be identified for
[27:38] the gathering of the harvest
[27:41] everything's got to be ready the token
[27:45] has got to be applied the tickets got to
[27:49] be in your hand if you get on an
[27:54] airplane I don't care what you said you
[27:57] bought but if you don't have the right
[27:59] ticket for the right seat you'll not
[28:03] ride that airplane I don't care what
[28:06] your story says I don't care what your
[28:11] story says and I don't care who you are
[28:16] you've gotta have a ticket in your hand
[28:19] it's got a barcode on it that identifies
[28:22] you with that ticket that it's bought
[28:26] for and paid for and you have the
[28:28] opportunity to sit in that seat are you
[28:33] with me now I have a barcode I have a
[28:39] token of life that lives on the inside
[28:42] of me it's not me but it's him of what
[28:46] he deposited on the inside of me and he
[28:49] sealed me with the seal of the Holy
[28:51] Ghost are you into me brother random
[28:57] will talk about people come to church
[28:59] and they'll shake a preacher's hand he
[29:02] said we've adopted shaking and preachers
[29:04] hand for for for for being a Christian
[29:07] or lighting a candle he would say many
[29:11] different things or I go to a certain
[29:13] church that's not the new birth I'm
[29:16] gonna say this to you it's not the new
[29:18] birth you got to die to yourself and be
[29:23] filled with the Holy Ghost and your
[29:26] life's got to be cleansed by the Word of
[29:30] God the washing of the word the purging
[29:34] out we heard it last Saturday night the
[29:36] purging out of our life of things that's
[29:39] not like Jesus Christ everything's got
[29:48] to be in order but the random will type
[29:51] it unto a like a a rail car and he set
[29:56] that rail car he said there's an
[29:59] inspector that comes to see how it's
[30:01] been packed and he will check the
[30:04] packing of that to see that it'll be
[30:09] okay because it's got to make the
[30:12] journey are you with me we've got some
[30:16] incredible railroad men here and they
[30:19] understand what uh what uh there's a
[30:21] there's a seal that goes on there
[30:23] there's some paperwork and computer work
[30:26] that goes with that and that seal has
[30:28] got a
[30:29] number on it and the inspector is
[30:32] identified that with that seal so if it
[30:37] would go down through the the country
[30:40] and the the the packages start falling
[30:43] apart they'll go back to the inspector I
[30:47] say that in church world today there's
[30:50] too many faulty inspectors word just
[30:55] lets anything right and anything going
[30:58] and lives are not packed up for the
[31:01] journey are you with me here is what we
[31:06] did everything packed up and get it
[31:08] ready to go and make sure that it's
[31:11] wrought judgment begins at the house of
[31:14] God first we want we won't stand in the
[31:18] judgment there but we'll sit here and
[31:21] our response to the word tells us so the
[31:30] screen went out come out of her my
[31:31] people now under under some under under
[31:36] under great duress you left from places
[31:40] and maybe left churches people made fun
[31:44] of you for leaving Wow my grandma
[31:48] believed this and it was good for
[31:51] Grandma but the season changed there was
[31:56] a time that the Methodist was right but
[32:01] they organized that there was a time
[32:04] that that the Pentecost was right but
[32:07] they organized that
[32:09] and death came into the pot are you with
[32:15] me
[32:16] now I I don't want to just be a message
[32:19] Church and there's no life in here
[32:23] I don't want to have just a message
[32:25] labeling pictures on the wall and and
[32:28] are you with me in Allen and books and
[32:31] tapes available I just don't want to be
[32:33] a labeled Church I want to be the living
[32:36] realities of the Word of God of this day
[32:43] thought about the last meeting I thought
[32:48] about it in some comparison as I was as
[32:52] I was said in here
[32:53] I thought about if I could just go back
[32:56] for just a bit the Lutheran Church if
[32:59] Martin Luther could go to where they
[33:01] were they worship maybe to the head
[33:04] Church I'm not talking about the
[33:06] spin-offs maybe to the head Church I'd
[33:10] say he'd be quite disappointed I I would
[33:16] adventure to believe he'd be quite
[33:18] disappointed we could just do some
[33:21] skipping I'd say John Wesley that
[33:25] actually got kicked out of the Lutheran
[33:26] Church because his father was a part of
[33:28] that and then it then he came and he
[33:30] began to preach that that you needed a
[33:33] clean life and there was a deep that was
[33:36] calling and they kicked him out of the
[33:38] church and and even in the preaching
[33:40] fields and preached on street corners
[33:42] and and he began to have an open vision
[33:45] and send the word to everybody I'd say
[33:51] if he came to the Methodist Church today
[33:53] I'd say it'd be quite disappointed I'd
[33:58] say he'd be quite disappointed with all
[34:00] the politics and a lot of seeing spirit
[34:07] that's come a moment I'd say if FF
[34:11] Bosworth and men like that could be gone
[34:13] to a Pentecostal churches and see where
[34:18] they're at today with their money
[34:20] schemes and their programs and where
[34:25] they are today compared to where they
[34:27] were almost a hundred years ago
[34:30] I'd say that messenger would be
[34:32] disappointed but I thought about the
[34:36] services last weekend if it's we was to
[34:39] introduce brother Branham I'd say that
[34:44] messenger would be quite pleased
[34:58] now we're not looking for brother
[35:01] branham to come back and preach are you
[35:04] estimating I want you to listen to tapes
[35:06] I want you to read the books I want you
[35:08] to do that but let me just say this
[35:11] youyou must have a live ministry that's
[35:14] anointed with the holy ghost ghost got
[35:17] garden called Thunderbolts to the
[35:20] pulpit
[35:21] that's a God in action for you and this
[35:24] day are you with me are you with me now
[35:30] notice what brother Branham says we've
[35:33] come to the last stage the Laodicean age
[35:37] that is our age we know it's the last
[35:40] stage for the Jews are back in Palestine
[35:42] no matter how they got there they are
[35:44] there this is the harvest time and
[35:48] before that can be a harvest there has
[35:50] to be a ripening I'm a maturing of both
[35:53] of the vines the Lutheran age was
[35:55] springtime in the Wesleyan age was a
[35:57] summer growth and the Laodiceans it's a
[36:00] harvest time of the gathering of the
[36:01] tears for the bonding and burning and
[36:04] the garnering the wheat for the Lord
[36:07] harvest turn have you noticed that the
[36:10] harvest time there is a a real
[36:13] acceleration in the ripening there is
[36:18] consequently a slowing of growth until
[36:21] there's no growth is that not exactly
[36:25] what we are seeing now are you with me
[36:30] now notice notice of statement I just I
[36:34] just joined the statement with that the
[36:37] people who took his revelation from God
[36:40] B became to live in epistles read and
[36:43] known of all men for their generation
[36:46] when the Methodists failed God raised up
[36:50] others so that has gone through the
[36:53] years until the Indus last day there is
[36:56] again another people in their land who
[36:59] under their messenger
[37:02] will be the final voice to the final age
[37:09] that's more than a quote you're the
[37:12] reality to that
[37:16] amen amen are you get are you getting
[37:20] too cold or you're too hot or they say
[37:22] you're cold so mother and if you can
[37:25] just work on the could be in too cold I
[37:26] don't want them too cold I want you to
[37:27] do cold don't you're too hot I want you
[37:30] just wrapped I don't want too big a
[37:34] chance to little chair I want one just
[37:36] right I don't want too big too bad or
[37:38] too little a bit I want one just right I
[37:40] don't want to bigger bowl or too little
[37:42] Bowl I want one just right now I've got
[37:49] the babies on board you know that in the
[38:00] masterpiece he said he'll never be at
[38:02] the harvest time the seed is back to the
[38:05] original condition I must have all the
[38:08] word in order to be the see you can't
[38:11] have a half a seed it won't grow in that
[38:14] right you can't have a half a seed it
[38:16] won't grow you got to have it all you
[38:22] gotta have it all well this is what I
[38:26] think no you've got to have it all you
[38:28] got to eat the whole book forgive me for
[38:32] squeaking my allergies are acting up I
[38:35] feel like Feeny up here brother Brennan
[38:37] said he was squeaking and and people
[38:39] said well why why why do people come to
[38:41] see you preach and he said well he said
[38:45] they must come to see Jesus well you've
[38:48] got a squeaky voice well they come to
[38:50] see Jesus you're an ugly man well they
[38:55] come to see Jesus he said now I believe
[39:04] in the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[39:06] hallelujah I believe in speaking in
[39:09] tongues that's just part of the scene he
[39:13] said back now now but now there is added
[39:17] to that he said the life not the gifts
[39:21] the life of the gifts
[39:24] see what I mean weird the end time
[39:27] brethren let me just say this if you we
[39:30] did we've got Jesus we've got every gift
[39:35] Scout the tassel the husk it's dead and
[39:38] dry now there's only one thing that has
[39:41] to happen that is to be gathered in the
[39:45] World Council of Churches for it's
[39:46] burning the world has become flesh
[39:51] exactly like it was promised to do in
[39:53] Luke chapter 17 in Malachi chapter 4 and
[39:57] that's right revelations all true life
[40:01] that was in the stalk and the tassel and
[40:05] the husk is now gathering into the seat
[40:09] ready for the resurrection ready for the
[40:13] harvest the Alpha has become the old
[40:17] make up the first has come last and the
[40:22] last has come first the seed that went
[40:25] in has come through a process and has
[40:28] become seed again the same seed that
[40:32] went down this the same seat that came
[40:35] up with me you'll identify with these
[40:40] scriptures in Hebrews chapter 11 in
[40:42] verse 37 they were stoned they were sawn
[40:47] asunder
[40:48] they were tempted and slain with the
[40:51] sword and they wandered about in
[40:52] sheepskins and goatskins being destitute
[40:55] and afflicted and tormented of whom the
[40:58] world was not worthy
[40:59] they were our brothers and sisters of
[41:05] whom the world was not worthy they
[41:08] wandered in deserts and in mountains and
[41:10] dens in the cave
[41:11] and these all having obtained a good
[41:14] report through faith received not the
[41:16] promise
[41:19] God having provided some better thing
[41:22] for us that they without us cannot be
[41:27] made perfect and they'll look at you
[41:33] sometimes we stand in awe how could they
[41:36] give their children up and I want to be
[41:43] too graphic here but there's just
[41:45] nothing you know in this day what makes
[41:48] me want to give my children up as a
[41:53] matter of fact we're anointed to fight
[41:55] for our children will not leave a hoof
[42:00] come on will not leave a one come on
[42:10] there's none of you that I want to lose
[42:13] [Applause]
[42:20] wherefore wish we were compassed about
[42:23] with so great a cloud of witnesses all
[42:26] of those has run the race now notice now
[42:30] we come to a next part
[42:31] let us lay aside every weight and the
[42:36] sin which that's so easily beset us and
[42:40] let us run but with patience the race
[42:45] that is set before us I'd like to say
[42:49] this to you I am committed to finishing
[42:53] if my finishing is tonight or next week
[42:57] or 10 years or 20 years or until the
[43:00] rapture happens I am committed
[43:05] I'm not committed till I lose my faith
[43:08] or my emotions go by the wayside or or I
[43:11] don't have the energies no more I am
[43:14] committed sometimes there will be a
[43:24] thousand with you all along the way and
[43:27] it's easy when everybody's energies
[43:28] right there with you and it's raw raw
[43:31] but when you're standing alone that's
[43:33] generally where Satan meets you I'm
[43:36] committed with a thousand or by myself
[43:44] hallelujah what you just think we could
[43:52] have all chosen easier way softer
[43:56] approach more gentle path any cute we
[44:09] got a bottle choose easier ways softer
[44:13] approach easier path had to say it
[44:17] together my thoughts again but I'd like
[44:21] to just report to you I have no regrets
[44:28] so if we've come to the harvest we're
[44:31] the results of all of these years the
[44:38] decades that I've served the Lord since
[44:40] a boy has not been mistake-free there's
[44:47] times that I'm embarrassed and even my
[44:49] own conduct as being a Christian
[44:52] embarrassed that my thoughts never been
[44:55] embarrassed of God under his
[45:01] administration I've never been
[45:03] embarrassed at God but I sure
[45:05] embarrassed him but it didn't throw me
[45:08] away I'm real glad that God don't look
[45:12] at my mistakes said this before this is
[45:20] a good place to have a fresh start you
[45:22] come in from the world you you've had so
[45:25] many habits in your life you come in and
[45:28] God begins to clean you up and begins to
[45:30] worship now in God's memory it's as
[45:33] though you never did it in the first
[45:35] place so that's why I look at you Anna I
[45:38] don't want to I don't want a 15 page
[45:41] report of all the things that you've
[45:43] been through and the habits that you've
[45:45] had and the difficulties and all the
[45:47] things that you've done wasn't good at
[45:49] soccer anyway and I don't need all of
[45:52] those things in your life just jump in
[45:55] there's work to do what can I do feel
[46:06] the need
[46:08] if it's water that needs to go carry
[46:10] water somebody needs an encourage of it
[46:14] pat on the back pat him on the back if
[46:16] you're a man preferably you plant a man
[46:18] on the back you might get some woman but
[46:22] her husband upset at you so if I have no
[46:32] regrets
[46:34] somewhere I committed I've got to do my
[46:37] best I know brother Branham says that
[46:42] you know he uses what you surrendering
[46:45] and he uses what you what you give to
[46:49] him and and all your gifts he can't use
[46:53] that but he uses your weakness I
[46:58] understand that quote but you know if I
[47:02] hired a man and he constantly had his
[47:07] hands in his pocket and said I can't do
[47:09] that I wouldn't have him around long I'm
[47:22] gonna preach to you now now you know if
[47:27] you can find something for me to do you
[47:29] know that's in my ability so what you've
[47:32] got to do is you got to find a spot you
[47:39] see I've been in the secular world I've
[47:44] worked it with government facilities and
[47:48] let me just say the reason that they
[47:50] hire you is is they've got a job to do
[47:54] now they're not going to put I made
[47:57] bombs at one time so their number put
[47:59] your name on the bomb when they sent him
[48:02] over there and then and Iraqi war some
[48:05] of the bombs that I helped make was was
[48:07] shipped off they never told them Ron
[48:10] Spencer help make that bomb but you see
[48:14] America needed some bombs mate
[48:16] and so I was in a program to wear that
[48:20] we made bombs and and and I didn't need
[48:26] my name attached to that are you with me
[48:31] now I was a I was a I was a meat cutter
[48:35] at one time and I didn't sign my name to
[48:38] the filet mignon I never forget I just
[48:43] give you a little story there was a man
[48:44] there was a man that came in to the
[48:46] store and he was a big gruffly Manning
[48:49] to tell if he had money and and he was
[48:51] standing there and I was the youngest
[48:52] butchered in his shop and he said I want
[48:55] I want I want 12 filet mignons that's it
[48:58] and I want his prettier filet mignons is
[49:01] you've ever seen and he said I want you
[49:03] to cut him and I want him right and I
[49:04] said absolutely so I took the time I cut
[49:07] him I I got him ready I put him out and
[49:09] I showed him to the man he said that's
[49:11] not filet mignons okay so the oldest
[49:17] butcher his name was will burn he took
[49:19] those same filet mignons he went back
[49:21] into the cooler he stood down he he
[49:24] goofed off and me and him talked for a
[49:26] while he rearranged those filet mignons
[49:28] and he walked back out and showed demand
[49:31] of LeMans he said now that's what I'm
[49:33] looking for
[49:44] long story short
[49:46] God gives these young people as well as
[49:48] he uses old people we've got a job to do
[49:53] do the best that you can do in that job
[49:57] [Applause]
[50:04] when you can say it like this
[50:06] I have given my all I have given my all
[50:16] I've left nothing undone that's quite a
[50:22] statement nothing has been left undone I
[50:26] can look back and see where I could have
[50:29] done better I'm gonna look back to see
[50:33] where I could have done better but it
[50:34] was the best that I had at the moment
[50:36] that I was in everybody can be a Monday
[50:39] Morning Quarterback or Blanca and look
[50:43] back at two human mistakes what I'd like
[50:47] to say that even tonight I want to
[50:50] present my best whether I'm the speaker
[50:55] or whether that I'm the hero I want to
[50:58] give my best so our church is not a
[51:04] Church of what we would say
[51:05] entertainment our church is a church
[51:09] where we come and we worship together
[51:12] and we're at the harvest time and so we
[51:15] realize that every minute is important I
[51:21] do realize in this fast-moving world
[51:25] that in the entertainment you're
[51:27] entertained you get up in the morning I
[51:29] heard brother Donnie talking the other
[51:30] day you get up in the morning the Fox
[51:32] News and CNN news and and The Weather
[51:35] Channel and and the local channels and
[51:37] after a while you find the scripture
[51:41] that doesn't mean all those things are
[51:43] wrong you just gotta have a good balance
[51:46] to it I was interested in the storm that
[51:54] was coming up the coach this week and
[51:56] and I prayed diligently if there's ever
[51:58] been a storm the prayed for I prayed for
[52:00] that one it would stay at sea because
[52:05] I've been through some storms I don't
[52:08] like him I don't like lightning I really
[52:14] don't like it sister Katie she loves
[52:17] lightning flash and she likes to go out
[52:19] and settle the Borchard watch the
[52:21] lightness of flash but you see up in on
[52:23] the end of one of them things knocked
[52:27] head off my weed eater thank God I had a
[52:40] weed eater in my hand man named
[52:48] Spurgeon's walking down the road with
[52:49] his best friend
[52:52] he's a boy lightning hits his best
[52:56] friend kills his best friend that
[53:01] lightning bolt killed his best friend
[53:03] but it woke him up to eternal life he
[53:07] was left here for a job I'd like to say
[53:09] that you've been left here for a job
[53:15] last weekend we came to this building
[53:17] with expectation and I trust our
[53:20] expectation has not been diminished are
[53:24] you Amy Paul would say it like this for
[53:27] I'm now ready to be offered up and the
[53:31] time of my departure let's just call it
[53:33] his harvest season what's at hand notice
[53:37] what he says I have fought a good fight
[53:39] I have finished my course notice these
[53:45] next words I have kept the faith Satan
[53:55] has sent me a lot of different
[53:56] directions but I'm still standing
[54:05] henceforth there is laid up for me a
[54:09] crown of righteousness which the Lord
[54:13] the righteous judge now let me just say
[54:17] this to you he is the administrator of
[54:20] the wheel so he knows whether we've done
[54:23] good or bad
[54:25] he knows whether we've done our best
[54:28] he knows shall give me at that day not
[54:37] to me only but unto them all of them
[54:39] that love his appearing he would say it
[54:42] again

[57:58] that'll be baked out of your life let it
[58:15] go let it go my god oh no I came here as
[58:22] a pastor about ninety nine we started
[58:26] the process mm brother Homer and I took
[58:29] a trip together it was just he and I we
[58:32] took a trip together and we were driving
[58:34] down the interstate we were about 12
[58:36] hours from here we're driving down the
[58:38] interstate and we're just going down the
[58:44] road and and I just made a little
[58:49] statement about my past life in the
[58:51] business world and then the chimney
[58:52] world and he and he just said and it's
[58:56] over and it's over and God just closed
[59:03] that chapter
[59:06] and it's over we're driving and we're
[59:12] getting up we're getting off on an exit
[59:13] I still remember we're getting off an
[59:15] exit and the revelation of how God
[59:18] cello's as a chapter on your life is
[59:21] kind of like that and he goes that's the
[59:25] end that's the end hit me and it hit me
[59:34] in that moment how God transitions you
[59:36] from one spot to another spot and how he
[59:41] moves you and you just kind of closes
[59:43] the chapter I'm coming toward a closer
[59:50] to an end of the service and Ruth was a
[59:53] more Vitus she was a servant in the
[1:00:01] field there come a time he just went
[1:00:11] rehab was a heart was a harlot and she
[1:00:19] became the captain's wife and the sin
[1:00:23] that was deposited in her later part of
[1:00:27] the lineage of Jesus Christ
[1:00:34] [Applause]
[1:00:42] many years ago I was called to the place
[1:00:46] it was away from here and a girl had
[1:00:48] lived a real ragged life night she had
[1:00:52] been devastated and boys had taken
[1:00:55] advantage of her she had got drunk and
[1:00:58] boys had taken advantage of her and her
[1:01:01] life seemed to be destroyed they called
[1:01:05] us to her to do a room we made the
[1:01:10] journey to where she was at I didn't go
[1:01:15] with a critical view I didn't walk into
[1:01:19] where she was at with a critical telling
[1:01:23] her all kind of things I began to talk
[1:01:25] to her about a god rich in mercy a God
[1:01:30] that can take you from last night and
[1:01:34] that be done and over with a God that
[1:01:38] can forgive you and help you to forgive
[1:01:42] yourself and can take you and make a
[1:01:45] real lady out of you
[1:01:46] a real lady out of you I'll tell you
[1:01:52] that girl that had a had a stained past
[1:01:56] and almost destroyed listens
[1:02:00] it don't take just moments for sin Satan
[1:02:02] to just destroy you and and and that
[1:02:10] girl
[1:02:10] right there in that room give her heart
[1:02:13] to Jesus Christ and I'll tell you she's
[1:02:18] a real lady today
[1:02:23] come on church Oh some people say well
[1:02:35] I've made some mistakes
[1:02:37] I know God knows how to change the
[1:02:39] chapter isn't that right I know God
[1:02:43] against the parole board and this is
[1:02:46] your you're free you're forgiven
[1:02:49] it's like God knows how to change your
[1:02:58] life live in a society this full of
[1:03:10] secret in nine cents it goes on God
[1:03:18] knows how to come and in that secret you
[1:03:20] know tell the world you're not to tell a
[1:03:23] bunch of people you don't have to be
[1:03:24] accountable like a vowels of Alcoholics
[1:03:27] Anonymous you just need a touch of Jesus
[1:03:32] that's what you need just a touch of
[1:03:35] Jesus let him transform your life
[1:03:52] maybe I'll close here now I'd like to
[1:03:56] say this to you Satan could have hid he
[1:04:00] destroyed you in a moment he would have
[1:04:05] destroyed you with the choices that you
[1:04:07] made because some of your choices wasn't
[1:04:10] good choices and others had bad
[1:04:14] intentions that caught you in
[1:04:17] circumstances you don't even want to
[1:04:22] tell your children about or maybe not
[1:04:25] even your made about but you know that
[1:04:29] it took God rich in mercy to get you
[1:04:32] here
[1:04:32] I like a God that knows how to take and
[1:04:40] forgive us of those things and not hold
[1:04:43] it against us no more
[1:04:45] and then we teach our children never do
[1:04:48] those things don't you do those things
[1:04:49] don't do this thing I'm preaching to you
[1:04:53] I'm preaching to you we can't live in
[1:04:56] Laodicea and overcome it
[1:05:00] we can't live in or Laodicea there's
[1:05:04] going to be some overcomers sage the
[1:05:20] song says it when we're inside those
[1:05:23] gates of pearl we'll learn a lot of
[1:05:26] things we'll have a heart that's made of
[1:05:30] gold perhaps a thousand string well sing
[1:05:37] and shout and dance about the lamb will
[1:05:41] dry your tears we'll have one grand
[1:05:45] homecoming week the first
[1:05:51] well the Homer came up to our place one
[1:05:54] day and he was in an old truck
[1:05:58] it's a guiding him just worse it's
[1:06:00] working on a bulldozer across the where
[1:06:03] you live Andrew he's working on a
[1:06:07] bulldozer
[1:06:10] Homer drove up we'd had a conversation
[1:06:12] and we'd had a shouting meeting here
[1:06:18] we'd head of Jubilee and we were just
[1:06:20] sharing some really wonderful moments
[1:06:22] and I told him I said you know King
[1:06:26] David would have been proud of you last
[1:06:28] night dancing the way you danced throwed
[1:06:32] them fist up in the air and hit that
[1:06:34] accelerator had his headaches truck and
[1:06:38] reverse watch that big ole oak tree just
[1:06:46] shot somehow along anyhow
[1:07:02] [Applause]
[1:07:12] brother Thomas Jeff really enjoyed
[1:07:15] seeing all of that business when that
[1:07:16] happened he was standing there burned he
[1:07:18] was laughing with his hands on his knees
[1:07:23] well sing and we'll shout dance about
[1:07:29] dry our tears brother Branham says this
[1:07:33] he said I believe that's right at the
[1:07:35] door really makes me nervous when I
[1:07:37] think not nervous for myself
[1:07:39] but nervous nervous of this have I done
[1:07:43] my best
[1:07:45] is there one more ounce in me that I
[1:07:48] could give for the kingdom of God is
[1:07:51] there something that I could have done
[1:07:53] because this is the only opportunity
[1:07:56] we're ever going to have right now I
[1:08:05] want you to realize you're only mortal
[1:08:07] once you're only mortal once that's a
[1:08:13] good time to praise the Lord right there
[1:08:16] I'm really glad I don't have to go
[1:08:18] through this again that's a reason I do
[1:08:26] believe that when the bride is called
[1:08:28] out and elected and said in the book of
[1:08:31] life there will come a sound from heaven
[1:08:34] that'll take such a baptism of the Holy
[1:08:36] Spirit into the bride that will take her
[1:08:39] from the earth in a rapture in grace God
[1:08:45] promised it I don't care how many
[1:08:48] science and how many astronauts that
[1:08:50] they signed up and everything else and
[1:08:53] how many million miles they can see I
[1:08:56] don't care nothing about that I like
[1:09:00] that I don't care nothing about that
[1:09:02] there is a heaven and there is a literal
[1:09:07] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:09:10] there will come in a body form to
[1:09:13] receive the church to himself no matter
[1:09:16] how old the story seems it's still the
[1:09:19] truth God said so and that's what
[1:09:24] believers believe
[1:09:28] [Applause]
[1:09:33] that's what we believe
[1:09:36] [Applause]
[1:09:41] well I looked at my hands and my hands
