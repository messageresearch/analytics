brother sent me this song A couple of months ago and it clicks so deeply in my heart and I think every one of you if you haven't heard it you'll say the same for yourselves it's it's not just Marcus's but it resonated so deep with the things that's happened over my life that I responded back to the brother and he said I knew it wouldn't fit for you he has a an awesome voice himself so I hope to hear him one day but I'm GNA borrow it today and I said I'm I'm fearful so if you're not sure just follow behind me a little bit and I do want to say it's never done this before but it's for you

wasn't able to be here this morning but that guy doesn't have to apologize for anything and uh when know that Satan's sure after him and in in every single way and so we just uh we're praying for him and believing that God's going to just touch him supernaturally today and Amen brother Ron's not just got a toothache going on and and uh oh he's he's battling a lot of things but we know that the the prayer of a righteous man availeth much so we we commit our we commit our heart to praying for our pastor also want to make mention um in weeks from uh this weekend on March the 15th and March 16th we were having our brother Tom Ray and brother Michael Ray um here again this year and so we want you to come with your hearts full and uh you all know that these brothers have a very special spot in our heart and and brother Tom was the one that led me to the Lord there and so he holds a very special spot in our hearts but I want you to I just I just say it like this I want you to package this place out I want you to invite your friends I want you to invite your your loved ones I want you to even invite those that you don't even think would receive it but invite them and uh just come here expecting I believe that these brothers they were so mightily used to the Lord last year we invited them to come and they're more than just friends to us they are they're men of this message and we just want to uh just open our our hearts door for the word of the Lord that is coming and we're just anticipating great things I believe that we're in a very uh special time that we are in right now and I I believe that God has very very specific things in this hour and I believe that the word of the Lord you can see it and I I know that there's a lot of things that you'll see on stream that sometimes take away from the inspiration and you'll see this brother preaching and you'll see this brother preaching and you'll think well they they've been kind of conjoining thoughts together they've been talking absolutely not I mean we're we're very close friends but we don't do those things but it's the spirit of God that is speaking in this last age and I believe that that YouTube and this internet sometimes it takes away from the realities that Christ is is speaking in in this part of the world and he's speaking in that part of the world and it's the same voice amen amen so I just believe that we're in a very special time amen how many has a need today that you'd like to make known to the Lord by the way of an uplifted hand amen it's good to see each and every one of you today amen let's just go to the Lord in prayer maybe maybe we just join our faith together and lay hands on one another and uh and just believing that all things are possible I just want to ask for special prayer for our pastor today that God would touch him in in a very special way father we come to you today Lord we're your children Lord and we we just want to bless your Holy Name today we want to say God there is no one like you Lord and Lord we realize whose presence that we are in lord it's it's it's a it's a presence that we're so thankful and humbled to be in Lord Jesus to to realize that it's it's not just by meere chance and opportunity that we have been a lotted this space and time to be able to stand here Lord I believe that you set these things up for us as your children you predestined us to stand in this hour Lord when we realize that the the enemy is is roaring and trying to to stop your voice from going forth today we ask Lord that you would speak Lord Jesus and let the lion roar oh God and you would you would let the lion of the tribe of Judah just roar in our hearts Revelations father that will thwart the very enemy in in our lives today Lord and you would just come here today I know that there are many that are sick and there's many needs that are amongst us here in our local assembly and we're asking father that you would move Lord Jesus and move through the congregation we realize Lord that that light is transferred from one another Lord that they're there is a gathering of people that is here and it is your Pillar of Fire that has drawn us here Lord and each of us has brought our little licks so father as our brothers and our sisters have have joined their fath together today Lord in one Accord I pray that there would be such a unity in our faith father that you could bring healing to our bodies that we would rightly discern that this is the body of Christ Christ that you are speaking through and today that they that we would literally not be able to have an infirmity amongst our midst Lord I know that as long as we're here we're going to deal with these things but I believe that we can have Divine Health along with Divine Healing and spiritual health and spiritual healing as well and we just invite you to be Lord today Lord for our pastor brother Ron we just bind our faith together and ask God a special touch to him today Lord according to Thy word we believe these things and we pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen if you have your Bibles today we'd like to look again in the Book of Psalms chapter 23 and also to Revelations chap 12 amen start at verse four today here I'd like to just read reread this quote to you where we're drawing this this context for mother Bram said in the beginning and the ending of the Gentile dispensation he said no wonder David said the Lord is my shepherd and I shall not want how he leads us by The Still Waters and restores their soul and runs our cups over and anoints us in the presence of the enemy he said did you ever get anointed in the presence of your enemy just to testify to your cup just bow over you know just how marvelous it is to be anointed when in the presence of your enemy verse four here in Psalms chapter 23 says yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies and thou anointest my head with oil and my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever amen Revelations chap 12 and verse 7 amen and there was war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and Prevail not and neither was their place found anymore in heaven and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world now hold on to that word deceiveth he deceiveth the whole world and he was cast out into the Earth and his angels were cast out with him and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down which accuse them before our God day and night and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their test Tony and they love not their lives unto the death therefore Rejoice ye heavens and ye that dwell in them woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea for the Devil is come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth that he hath but a short time may God bless his word you may be seated here today in the presence of the Lord again we'd like to speak to you on this this text anointed in the presence of the enemy mother Bron would say it like this he said in the midst of everything God will cause his enemies to testify to his glory in the midst of everything God will cause his enemies to testify of his glory and I believe that that's the hour that we are truly living in that the enemy is literally testifying of how great that the holy ghost that you have on the inside of you truly is and I I believe that that when you come and you refuse to give in to Satan's lies it again proves that thou art anointed and brother Brandon would say in the greatest battle ever fought he said now he said this great first battle that was ever fought began in heaven when Michael and his angels fought against Lucifer and his angels He said it first started and the first battle was in heaven he said so sin did not originate on Earth but it originated in heaven and then it was thrown down from heaven and cast out of Heaven to the Earth and fell on human beings so we realize that the the war started in heaven said that sin did not just originate that you see it here in the Garden of Eden but e that sin was found in Lucifer's heart and then it was then that that battle was thrown down and cast out of Heaven to the Earth and it fell on human beings he said then the battle from Angels became human battles and Satan come to destroy God's creation what God had had created to be hisself he had Satan come to destroy this Satan come to destroy this that which God had created for himself Satan come to destroy that he said that's what his purpose was to destroy it so God has a purpose and Satan has a purpose that we realize that then the battle began here on Earth and it began in us and it's been raging ever since and we realize that you go back all the way to the Garden of Eden and you see that battle that was there that you see the battle that was there between it the whole battle is based upon the word of God you you might feel like sometimes that it's very personal to you the battles that you are in and the attacks that you are in the reason why you are attacked so much if you begin to read in Matthew Chapter 13 about the one that went out and sold good seed and then there come one behind him that sold Bad Seed in there you see the attack isn't against you the attack is against the one that owns the field and our Lord Jesus Christ owns you and he is going to protect you so don't feel like just because you're going through the battle or just because you're going through Le osia and you got troubles God God's not just singling you out Satan is after every one of us he is after every single one of us and you see when God begin to establish his Eden you see when God established it he established it upon righteousness but you look at Satan's Eden you'll see that it was established in unbelief it was established in sin and we realize that where we are right now is we are in Satan's Eden but we realize that when brother B is is standing there and he preaches in 1965 he said I want to bring to you something that will keep the punches off of you so we realize that the message that you and I have been given in this hour is a message that will keep the punches off of us as much as possible and I believe that if we're going to overcome Le oosa if we're going to overcome Satan's Eden then there's only thing that we can PR there's only one thing that we can prepare oursel in this battle of strength Thor and it's the message of the hour amen now now brother random would say when you when you begin to look in the Ephesian Church age he said now he said we start with the fact that there was two trees in the midst of the garden he said the tree of life was Jesus he said the other is definitely Satan because of what came forth of the fruit of that tree he said now then we know that both of those trees had a relationship to man or they would have never been place there they must have had a part in The Sovereign plan and purpose of God in their relationship to mankind andto himself or we can never impute omniscience unto God this is all true so far is it not he said now the word most definitely sets forth that from before the foundation of the Earth the purpose of God was to share his eternal life with man so we realize that this is a part of of of God's three-fold purpose that he would he wanted to reveal himself to the people that's a part of it and we look all the way back in the Garden of Eden this was not a surprise to God but there were two trees there was two persons that was there in the Garden of Eden and one was the tree of life and one was the tree of knowledge which we realize that that was Satan himself the person in that tree but we realize that when God put man here he placed him upon free moral agency to choose for himself to to choose and to create and to to move things here and there and when Eve had made her choice because being placed here on free moral ageny she made the wrong choice and chose the wrong tree instead of the right tree now Paul said in Ephesians 1 and4 according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world somebody say before the foundation of the world he chose us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love and I'm going to skip all the way down to verse 11 he said in whom also we have obtained an inheritance obtained and inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will so there is nothing that is happening that God has not already seen we can say Amen to that I believe that even right here that all almighty God saw before before the world was ever spoken to existence he saw the battles and the attack of the enemy that we are going to go through and we realize that God has predetermined our being here he has predetermined our being here and I I would just like to say this as we get ready to go into these things that God did not predetermine us here to let us be lost and to let us lose this battle but God predetermined us because he saw us winning the battle that is here in front of us I say blessed be the name of the Lord I want to say that God predetermined Eve and God knew that Eve was going to make the wrong choice and God knew what kind of choice that you was going to make but God did not choose you because of the choice that you were going to make God chose you before you can make the right choice or the wrong choice before you may chose him to serve him all the days of your life before you can make that right kind of a choice God elected you God for ordained you you might have grew up in a drunkard's home you might have grew up in a family that didn't know God but before before your parents ever made the right decision or the wrong decision almighty God elected You by for ordination to choose you to stand in this evil age Hallelujah I say that God predetermined Eve is that right he predetermined Eve but he was not willing that she would be without Fellowship so he created himself he created them a a place where they could walk back into Fellowship again but when when God starts walking down through the Garden of Eden after man falls it's amazing how Humanity likes to play the blame game of where the attack comes from when it's really your fault you start blaming everybody else I mean it's it's an amazing thing when you start blaming everybody else and you're the one that created the message you got yourself in I say sometimes you just need to own up and fess up to the fact I'm the one that messed up God but when God started walking with her brother Doug he started talking to her and she said it was that serpent it was that tree that you put here that came in here and beguiled me now when you look at that word begal it means to seduce it means to deceive notice when he was cast down out of Heaven he came here to deceive this world that serpent that you created God them troubles that you created them tempt no no no no no no no this is on you but God didn't not leave you here so that you could just go through the seduction of the devil and go through the deceiving he give you a way out of it now Paul said in his first letter to Timothy chapter 4 and one he said now the spirit speaks expressedly that in latter times shall some depart notice some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils so the spirit speaks in this generation expressing me that there's going to be some that will depart from the faith now you know that Jude that the book of Jude says that that that you ought to contend for the faith there ain't but one faith is that right there's only one Faith there's a lot of religions but there's only one faith and this powerful spirit that has come in this way in this age has come here not to deceive you to to make you not to make you just just to be a bad a good person or a bad person but it's come here to deceive you from the faith and would get heed give heed to seducing he said you know what sedu is he said a seducing spirit in the church he said that is clergy it's a seducing clergy Spirit workings of devils of hypocrisies in the church so you notice back when it started after after the Ephesian Church a and you watch if that seducing Spirit comes in there they had a perfect Faith but you watch that seducing Spirit come in there and it starts manipulating through the clergy and there all of a sudden all of these things come together you watch the most predominant spirit that you face today it is not tobacco it is not drinking but the most seducing spirit that you will face is a spirit of religion it's a spirit of tradition I can stand to you and and I can I can witness the fact that that that there is that I say this that there's no there's no spirit that cannot be broke by the name of Jesus Christ but the hardest one to break is a religious spirit it's somebody that thinks they're okay and they believe they're okay under their denominational ideas of ideologies but there is a power in this age to that you are anointed with to conquer every Spirit to conquer every denominational spirit it's a seducing spirit that makes it where God that makes Satan look like God Almighty and he's Hallelujah and you think you're worshiping God but you're making love with the devil now that's a powerful Spirit to make you think you're doing the right thing and in turn you're worshiping Satan but I love what the scripture said to every single one of the ages he that has an ear let him hear what the spirit is saying under the churches yes there's an antichrist spirit that is speaking but there's a voice that is still in this generation that is speaking louer than seducing spirits that is greater than deceiving Spirits there is a power that has produced powerhouses to not be deceived by the LIE of the devil we realize in this generation that we are facing more demons than any other age we realize that when the seals released that those demons that come out out of the river of Euphrates that you'll see there in the Book of Revelations these are Supernatural Chargers Supernatural devils and the Bible said in Revelations 9 and 19 that their power is in their mouth and in their tals now the prophet taught us it's in the tale that they're telling you don't think you don't think it's powerful you just let them start quoting Matthew 288 and 19 you don't think it's powerful they have built a cont an entire religious system on the words of Jesus that were taken out of context without Revelation and it has seduced the whole world and the Catholicism ideology has built it up in such a way that to make people think that they have the rule in the word of God that they speak instead of the word of God but the spirit of God in this generation has come to curse that Spirit to break that spirit I say that the message of the hour break the strongest hold that Satan can ever offer to you this message breaks the spirit of Catholicism well you say Well it don't it don't bother me I can I can worship like everybody else let me say this let me say this they are connected by the umbilical cord of baptism in Trinity of titles and you think well they're Baptist and they're good people it ain't them people what's up brother Andrew who are you after this morning I ain't after any of them people but I am after that devil that makes people think that just because they're good people and just because they love Jesus and just because they sing good songs and just because they worship makes them a Christian I'll say this there is a spirit that has spoken this generation to curse that Li of the devil I say this you can't worship God in spirit and truth and be in a false religion false religion will create false spirits and false spirits will create a false identity in you you wonder why they're sin amongst their preachers they're sin amongst their pastors they're sin in the clergy it's because they are they are worshiping God through vain ideology and they don't know the god that they're talking about now he's good people in there but it's a spirit behind it you see what these demons in this last age are designed to attack those that are willing to press into God's word they are lit spirits that have come through a Roman Empire spirit that has revived itself in ideologies of of system ideas that has constantly Brainwashed the masses of the people to make people think they're in the right but I love the scripture in Revelations 18 it said come out of her my people that you be not partaker of her sins that you receive not of her plagues so you can see why that Antichrist Spirit hates the power of the true spirit because every single time that power exposes that Antichrist it exposes him and his Future Works is that right now watch what brother random says in Le utsy and church age he said now why did these false prophets come against the true prophet and discredit his teaching he said it's because they are running true to form as did their forefathers when in the days of Ahab and they withstood Micaiah so the Same Spirit that's in this age Was the Same Spirit that was back in ahab's day and that same Spirit That Came Upon Ahab and in that age was the Same Spirit that was all the way back there in the Garden of Eden that did not come from Adam and it did not come from Abel but it came from the wicked one you carry the nature of your parents so what was in God that would make Cain kill a it could not have been his seat but what was in the seat of Jesus that he could turn to them Wicked ones and said I forgive you it shows the power of the battle of the seeds that was back there in the Garden of Eden that was right there in the age when Christ was here and it shows the ability of that seed even right now they were 400 of them all of them were in agreement by them all saying the same thing they fold the people but one Prophet just one was right and all the rest of them wrong because God had committed the Revelation to only one beware of false prophets for they are ravening wolves now the spirit is speaking expressly in this generation to watch them things to watch them think you think well I I I you know I'm I'm covered by the message and I'm not going to have to go through these things absolutely contrary you're going to face these things as long as you're here when Jesus himself was standing there he knew he was born for a purpose and when he come to the fullness of his ministry at 30 years old he's standing there and he realizes that he's Anointed with a purpose to stand against the crowd he's anointed for it he's elected to stand there and when Jesus goes in Luke chapter 4 and he goes back to his hometown they couldn't handle the anointing that was on him they could not handle the anointing that was on him brother Jonathan neither can this world handle the anointing that is on you and Jesus stood there when the book of Isaiah was was handed unto him and he read to them out of Isaiah 61 arise and shine for that now the anointed one is speaking unto you he's anointed me to preach he's anointed me to do these things and you watch what happened they could not handle that he was calling himself deity they could now I'll tell you what they enjoyed his miracles you watch The Same Spirit today they W they enjoyed the first pole they enjoyed the second pole but when it come to the revealing of the opening of the word they could not handle the anointing that was there they could not handle the power that was behind that saying that his him that was too much that was too much to say that I am my father are one that was too much and he come there in his own Hometown and the Bible said that all day in the synagogue when they heard these things they were filled with wrath this was not a holy anger this was a demonic wrath notice what they did they took him out on the cliff and they wanted to cast him down but because it was not his time the spirit of God would not allow to cast him off I want to say this to you Satan has come against you with every sickness and every Power and every disease but he cannot touch you he cannot take your life he cannot destroy you because it is not your time yet it is your time right now to arise and shine glory be to God Thou Art anointed in this age there's birth things that are going on but I say this day this scripture is fulfilled whoa glory be to God they couldn't hear that voice they couldn't understand that voice maybe try cutting the monitors down here but not this maybe that's what's causing it Brothers they couldn't handle that voice but that voice that was speaking brother Chris had so much power that Jesus could say my sheep know my voice and a strength or they will not follow it might look deceptive to this one might look deceptive to that one but my sheep know my voice they're not going to follow this ideology they're not going to follow this here or there even though it looks right they know my voice they know what I've said they you may have never heard it before but just because you never heard it does not mean that you can't have it God knows where to find you at it doesn't matter how long you've been in the message and how long how short you've been in the message God knows who you are and his voice will wake up that seed I don't care how far you are covered up in sin if you are part of his his voice will come across you just like it come across Lazarus and woke him up from the grave you might have been covered up with theology you might have been covered up with sin but when the voice of the Resurrection help me Jesus brother said he's the final voice on all authority he has all the authority of everything God has the supreme authority you notice in this age William Brandon was not acting on his own stad he was getting this knowledge From Another World you know he said I I'm standing in two world but he's not getting this knowledge just he's not just making this up brother Mar was was illiterate and he only had a seventh grade education but brother Brandon was a very well-studied human being he studied the he studied out the scriptures he had studied out the the ideas of men he had he had read through Matthew Henry he had read through Spurgeon he had read through Calvin he had looked through it all but he did not get this knowledge from these books he got this knowledge from an Angelic being that was standing there to make sure that there would be a a correct anointing that would be released in this generation and I'll say if it wasn't released then we are missing Malachi 4 and it's got to be fulfilled because we've got to have a restoration to be able to make a Rapture is that right but I happen to believe that this man William brandham was exactly in line with Malachi 4 and he was standing there grabbing a revelation from almighty God that set him in that set him him in an order so that you can make it through the worst of Ages I'll say this that this prophetic Authority is a supreme authority they could not understand Eli they could not understand water baptism they could not understand serpent seed but a prophet even though 400 tried to stop him but one Prophet stood for truth I tell you it matters where the voice is coming from brother Christian it's real power behind it I say there's real power behind this voice he'll wake you up and get rid of your problems you think you had problems Lazarus had some bad problems he's a whole he was a whole lot worse off than any of you sitting here today I you can name the sickest person in here but Lazarus was a whole lot worse off but when The Voice come against him when the voice came against death all of a sudden it woke something up you see you see that same voice spoke to the woman at the well that day and she had more critics than anybody sitting here she had a whole town that knew what she had done they she had she had had relationships with people that were of a great stature but this voice that was speaking to her said I that speak unto you I am he he was greater than her critics he was greater than her H he was greater than her past when she heard the master speak that message satisfied her that Hallelujah she was going to receive a seventh man that would make her stay with the word now you know good and well the world's offered you everything there is it's through everything ain't that right brother Randle it's threw everything at you trying to get you you could have been serving God and you could have took your gift to another place you could have been you could have you could have took your family and done great things with your gift but because a voice spoken to you in this generation and told you to stay in this field to stay right here the master spoke to you and say you stay right here it might not look like you're flourishing right now but let me say this you're going to flourish on that side like never before the master speaking unto you do you hear his voice stay in this field stay in this message stay in this truth he's offered you everything but it ain't got no power over an elect elected seat of God you see the lutherans had the word for their season and they organized it the wlans had their word for their season and then they organized from religion to religion the Lutheran failed the methodists failed but God has raised up other so it has gone on through the years until the last day there is again another people in the land who under their Messenger will be the final voice to the final age yes sir the church is no longer the mouthpiece of God it is its own mouthpiece so God is turning on her he will confound her through the prophet and the bride for the voice of God will be in her yes it is I'm gonna give you a second to enjoy it that voice is in her yes it is because it says do you read do you read the Bible do you believe the Bible because it says in the last chapter of Revelations verse 17 the spirit and the bride say come once more the world will hear direct from God as at Pentecost but of course that word bride will be repudiated as in the first age what are you saying brother Andrew I'm saying you're anointed to speak I'm saying you ain't got to be pushed off in some corner I know the religions of the world have had tried to threaten you and try to make you believe that this message ain't right but I say this that you are anointed to speak You're anointed to take a open book in this generation and go out there and prophesy and speak the same things you don't have to recreate the new you don't have to recreate the will you don't have to create something just take what them tape say I'm going tell you right now I take what them tapes say and I've never seen seen one time that it's to come against the powers of the enemy and it's ever been thed this message is alive what are you saying brother Angel I'm saying you're anointed I'm saying you're anointed sister Cassie I'm saying you're anointed brother Joey I'm saying you're anointed sister Melissa I'm saying you're anointed you mean it's that simple yes I do because the message is enough the message is enough our headship brought us this message so all you got to do is stay under the message stay under the anointing stay under this power because the enemy is challenging you he's challenging you to stay with this word brother Ron says something and I I always I'm I'm very I'm marveled at this statement how did you get here and why are you still here and you know good and well he ain't just challenging brother Ron he ain't just challenging the ministry here but he is challenging every single one of you to stay with this message but what makes you keep believing that the message is right it must be the same seed that came from the father that is dwelling in you that constantly keeps you here it keeps you clean and when the voice said now listen to this you you know that ain't right there's something on the inside of you said now that's a lie from the devil that's a spirit from the devil and he know knows how to manipulate it in such a way that make it look right come on somebody they can do all they want to with William brandom stories they can say 16 men didn't fall off a bridge they can say that a cloud didn't happen they can say it was a rocket fuel that created all them things they could say all that but they cannot question the authority of a man meeting an angel in a cave that gives you and I the ability to believe that not even cancer shall stand before the prayer of a righteous human being come on somebody they can attack all they want to out there in the world but they cannot stop thus sayith the Lord so what am I saying I'm saying that the same spirit that is in you is Anointed to speak back to that demon ah blessed be the name of the Lord why how how can you be so steadfast you might ask me that sister J how how could you be so steadfast when the enemy constantly attacks and assails it's it's kind of like Abraham had a revelation he had nobody else understood it Against All Odds he was standing against everybody that disbelieved in what the angel was talking to him and saying things to him but he knew that he was fellowshiping with Elohim he recognized the voice that had led him all the way from his youth he was leading him to a destination and he took him when he was baring when he was baren in his own W and his own his own wife was baring his own life could not produce seed he was able that voice that was speaking unto him was able to turn his deadness into life he was able to say the same thing that Ezekiel said to them dry bones to come alive on the inside of Abraham and Abraham had a revelation no matter how mad how mad the opposition got no matter how they tried to make fun of him and mock him and criticize him say you call yourself a father of Nations you ain't even got your own self a boy yet you know good and well that you got them same enemies that are lying to you you say you going to make a Rapture but you're still here you say you're going to overcome but you're still here we ain't seen leosia we ain't seen Los Angeles Fall underneath the water you stick around wrong enough you going to I don't know whether we go before it or whether we go after it all I know is I'm gone I know that it was an earthquake That Shook place on Easter morning and it might be just that way that a rapturing of the saints that all of a sudden earthquakes and we're gone but Abraham had a revelation had a revelation now Hagar stepped in but Abraham knew that it had to come through Sarah this MDC stood in this generation there was a lot of people that stood close to it and they watched it but MDC knew who the seed was meant for there was a lot of people that heard it there was a lot of people that stood by but this one was elected to receive a body change to produce a supernatural Abraham was put through some testing he was supposed to go some of the through what we would say some of the greatest trials and you waited all your life brother Shannon to see brother Dyan in his condition but now he here but now God is requiring something greater for you he's now asking you to take your son and take him and climb upon the mountain about three days journey there and take him and lay him on the altar Abraham had a revelation and brother Joey sent me this this week he said now he said brother maram said now stand in your fortified condition he said live die sink or drown you stay right there just the same when Abraham the father of the faithful pulled out that knife and pulled hair back on on that child's head to cut his throat he said I'm persuaded that God is able to raise him up from the dead in the figure that I fill him in he said he was willing to follow the word of God to the end you get it sometimes God's going to ask hard things of you sometimes God's going to require you to stand when nobody else is willing to stand but no matter what it is you stay right there no matter what you you got to go through no matter what you got to pass through stay right there if everything seems to be you can't go one inch further go that inch CU said I ain't got much room to walk you take one step you go that one step and if you hit the wall stand there until God makes a way through it I say stand in this message live in this message believe this message said in Ephesian church he he said now let this be known scripture does not play with words he said whatever is in the record is there for the anointed eyes to see it he said it's there for a purpose I want I want to say this that you are elected to see it one way and that way is God's way he didn't have to give Eve anything else to overcome Satan he gave her the greatest thing he could ever give her when he gave her the word of God I'll say the message is enough but what God gave Eve there in the Garden of Eden it was enough to stop the Serpent's lies it was enough to stop the curse it was enough to keep her from every heartache but Jesus showed us what it would take to defeat Satan he didn't use his power he used the word brother Mar said there's a lot of people that misunderstand the anointing he said the anointing is not emotions the anointing is not shoutings he said those are blessings from God he said but the anointing is supreme power under control look at the maniac and or organ you look at it it was supreme power in control you look at it there in Chicago with those 300 men it was supreme power under control but when somebody goes to believing what the word of God said that right there is a Deathstroke to Satan when every man or every son and daughter of God can take God at his word it'll kill Satan every single time and Satan was standing there in the form of The Serpent and making all of these promises to e and you're right here in Satan's eating and he's making them same promises you can still serve God the way you feel who you after brother I'm after that devil I'm after that devil you can still serve God you can do what you want to still cut your hair still live there it is you can still do what you want to you can dress any way you want to and he'll make all kinds of promises to you can I quote a prophet to you he said but Satan can't keep any of his promises because he ain't got nothing to give he said he ain't got salvation and he ain't got L all of his kingdom is nothing but darkness and sin he said that is Satan's kingdom so if Satan is offering you something it's an empty lie well I say the same thing with his promises and his lies they ain't got no power behind it what are you saying brother I'm saying if the devil told you you're not good good enough it's an empty lie I'm saying if you're telling you that you're not elected it's an empty lie I'm saying if he says you ain't going to make the Rapture it's an empty lie and ain't got no power behind it but there is one voice that stood in this generation and it's got power behind it it's got anointing behind it you ain't got to scream at that devil you just stay right there you're anointed I say you're anointed to stand in the face of your foes and in your friends with this message what are you saying brother Andrew I'm saying this that if you're going to attempt to make it out of lay o a sea you better deck yourself out in the whole armor of God because God's got one intention he's got one intention it doesn't matter what you got to go through to get there he's got one intention that he's going to express his life right through you his word is going to be expressed you might have to go through trial after trial and test after test but God's going to bring you to a Perfection a lukewarm condition will never never produced gold but if it's hot if it's hot then the master can beat the drop out of it don't get comfortable sitting where you are don't get satisfied staying where you are sometimes it's good to go to church and take a good beating every once in a while to beat the dress off of you because lay out ofia is thick the smoke that is coming out of this bottom of pit it's thick it gets on your skin it gets in your spirit I say this you are anointed how you get rid of smoke you just burn the flame H hotter come on somebody burn it hotter so if you're going to get rid of the smoke you got to have a fire that's hotter than the fire that's over there I say this holy ghost in fire it'll make you dance and Shout I say Let the Fire of the Holy Ghost burn this message ain't getting cold it's getting hotter and hotter and hotter get rid of the smoke believe the message Hallelujah you see a life lived by the word will be the word expressed just like Enoch's life he was the only one that was walking this close but he's a type of you and me he's a type of the seventh seventh from Adam and Enoch walked so close to God and I love the scripture said Enoch walked with God and he was not for God took him so Enoch's life he was walking so much in harmony with God's word so that he literally bypassed last death he was expressing the abilities that even though you have got to go through the shadow of death you can walk with God even though you got to walk through some trials when you're all alone you can walk with God even when nobody else is with you you can walk with God when the enemy is Raging walk with God when Satan comes in like a flood walk with God he walks so close with God that he bypassed death and brother Mar said and who is this MDC he said you bypass your theophany in order to come here and stand Temptation so God was literally using you to fulfill a part of his three-fold purpose that you are expressing you see well I don't feel like I've ever done anything great brother will I never I never laid my hands on anybody and they got healed I never I never shout I never I never did any of the say things that brother Ron did or brother brother Homer or brother brandom I've never seen any of those things I want you to know whether you see one Supernatural thing or not you are expressing the scripture that God will not lose one of his owns because all that the father ha given unto me will come to me and I will in no wise cast out who cares if you ever produce a miracle who cares if you ever see the Supernatural who cares you are expressing the godhead deity in Christ's form again that's what he's W to have the preeminence in his church back in the church and brother random said in Christ of mystery he said there would be a Time come forth that he could express himself in the fullness of his godhead deity through his church and have the preeminence in his church on my what the anointed man now the anointed people oh my to bring back the anointed bride and bridegroom anointed by what by why accepting what Eve turned down what did she turn down she turned down the word and when she turned down the word she turned down the rights to the tree of life she turned down the ability to speak to the mountain she turned down the abilities he said but you are anointed with what Eve turned down and he comes back and you and I we accept it you see she stood there Eve stood there and she listened to it under that deceiving Spirit she listened to the LIE of the devil now it had some truth in it but do you know that a prophet said that you are predestinated not to listen to the devil you're predestinated not to listen to the devil a come on boo devil boo devil you are predestinated not to listen to the devil but I am predestinated to listen to everything that Papa God's got to say to me I know what age I'm living in I'm living in an eag age where everything has been turned back to be able to say say to them out it's a returning of the hearts back that's what that eag anointing is to do it's to restore back the faith of the Pentecostal fathers back of Spurgeon had some great things finny had some great things under the man age there were some great things there and they're quotable but it was not a perfect word it was not back to what Paul was teaching because there were some things that were broke off that's why when William Brandon was standing there in Sportsman Halla he's wondering about these things because it was still broke off but there was a supreme authority brother Chris that was standing there that all of a sudden he said a a super anointing come sweeping down through that that holl down there I said what are you hunting he said I was sitting there and I was wondering if M if Mark 11:22 through 24 was under the atonement he said I stood there and the scripture said have faith in God speak to the mountain speak to the mountain whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe that you shall receive them you see those Redemptive RS that Adam sold us into he sold us that we lost all them RS but now they you see the first man Adam he lost all those things but the second man Adam came and restored all them things so you see under Adam all them channels was clogged up that power could not get through them channels that anointing could not get through them channels but under under the anointing of the seventh Angel's message every promise is personally your possession so it wasn't just William brandom speaking to a storm it wasn't just him talking to a fish it wasn't just Hattie but it's your anointing it's your power this is your Hallelujah Don't Be Afraid little children greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world I Know The Enemy the Antichrist spirit is coming in this generation like never before but you don't have to be afraid you got mountains in front of you but I say speak to the mountain speak to the mountain you might not see the mountain move but if you can see the grain of sand move keep on speaking just speak to the Rock what are you saying brother Andrew I'm saying that God has provided you anointing in this generation that has released the supernatural power to believe and the believer takes God at his word and right here in the midst of Satan's Eden you will win what did David say when he was tapping into this day when William brandom comes he doesn't choose from first Thessalonians and he doesn't choose from First Corinthians but he goes all the way back there to David and he preaches from there the Rapture in Psalms chapter 27 the Lord is my light and my salvation but he said for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion remember what the vision said I'll meet you in there in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me upon a rock what are you saying brother Andrew I'm saying that what you are under is a Rapture anointing the rest of the world ain't Anointed with it but you're Anointed with it so that's got to make you an exclusive class of people that's why I don't get off if you message people it's because y'all think you're the only ones going to make it no we don't there's a whole lot of Ages before us is going to make it come on somebody I didn't put myself here brother Chester I didn't say I was an exclusive class I didn't make myself believe this I didn't he said this about me he said you're a royal priesthood a chosen gener you people think you're something well I'll take it up with almighty God he elected me for this generation and I'm GNA run with everything that's within me I'm a final voice to the final generation so I'm going to stand under this anointing I'm going to believe this message and I'm going to run I might have to jump through some hurdles but I'm going run I might have to cross some Creeks but I'm going run I might have to go through the desert but I'm going to run I might have to go through hail and high water but I'm going to run I might lose some friends but I'm going to run I might make the devil mad but I'm going to run I say take this message and run with everything that's within you sacrifice your doubts what did the Book of Daniel say you watch it you watch Revelations 9 and Revelations 10 you watch Daniel 11 you watch Daniel 12 you watch the parallel in the scriptures and you notice that the Bible said and they in Daniel 11:32 and they that do know their God shall be strong and do exploits if you know you shall be strong and do now you can't do nothing without being strong and you can't be strong without a knowledge but if somebody has given and granted you this knowledge it'll make you strong right here in the midst of all of it when all kinds of lies of hypocrisy have come against the Church of the Living God that the people that do know their God I wonder how many people know God it ain't just some ideology ain't something that William brandham told you about it ain't something brother Ron told you about but you know him you know him in the power of Resurrection you believe him to be true you've tested his word you found out that he is the only true and wise God so if you do know God it'll make you strong in the midst of the lies look look at Daniel 11:32 put it up there for me sis and such as do wickedly against the Covenant shall be corrupt by flatteries so it shows you there is going to be some Wicked lies there is going to be some flatteries of of seducing spirits but the people that refuse to give in to the devil's lies and and his his ability to tickle your ears and stand there you shall be strong I say how are you strong I'd say it's by knowing all my God that this wasn't some weak angel that stood up in this generation but it was a mighty a strong angel look at Revelations 9 and look at Revelations chapter 10 and the word that connects the two is and it's a conjunction they work together so you see right here in Revelations 9 and you see Revelations 10 you see the spirit that this church is fighting against I read to you some very powerful things last night not but that ain't for days going by come on somebody I say I say this voice that is speaking unto you it's greater than nervousness I say you can be strong in knowing you're God that anxiety has got to go that fear has got to go there ain't no place in the Church of the Living God for fear to be there and Faith at the same time so faith has got to ride one of them's got to override the other and I say these people know they're gone and they're going to be strong and they're going to do exploits they're going to do marvelous things they're going to do Supernatural phenomenal things so it ain't just for William brandham it ain't just for this brother and that brother I say it's for the little housewife I say it's for the woman that chooses to be a janitor I say it's for the mama that's been praying for her children that's been asking I don't know she might be 60 something years old but she's still been asking and she's still been praying I believe it's that kind of woman that'll do exploits in this generation and you might only see one of your prayers ever answered but it was worth praying for I say it's worth fighting for in the midst of all of Le Osa you choose not to give up on God's promises you choose not to give in the devil's lies notice I just want to read these things and I I know I I've probably cooked you Goose a few times already but but Daniel said and at that time chapter 12 shall Michael stand up now who is Michael it's Christ The Mighty Angel you look at Revelations Chap 10:1 and I saw another Mighty Angel who is that up there it's Christ and at that time shall Michael stand up this ain't a time to sit down it's a time to stand up the great Prince which standeth through the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time and at that time my people shall be delivered everyone that should be found written in the book and many of them that sleep in the dust of the Earth shall wake some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contempt and they that be wise the people that do know their God and they that be wise now where did you get this wisdom from this understanding has got to come from the almighty this that has been delivered to you in this generation to be over to able to overcome the very prominent Spirit of religion it is a spirit of wisdom to be able to decipher between right and wrong the Bible said try the spirits and they that be wise shall sign shine as the brightness of the firmament they that turn many to righteousness as the Stars forever and ever brother Mar said in the message he said the Morning Star is only reflecting the Supreme light of the sun coming the Morning Star he said the reason why it's so bright you know why it is the sun's so much closer to it he said it's a pressing on and The Morning Star hails the coming of the sun he said all right you morning Stars it's time to go hailing his coming shine morning Stars and Rise early it shall be sun the it says the sun will be here soon when we look and see the Morning Star just a glistening in the skies it means that the sun will shine pretty soon and when we see the morning stars of God rising and Shining to the glory of the resurrection of Jesus Christ it shows what are you talking about brother Andrew you're talking about a people that is Anointed to shine why do you say it why are you keep preaching these things because you're anointed to do it oh you don't know what it does it shows that the Supreme one is pressing on the lights are gathering but the Morning Star hollers hold on it isn't long till daylight hold on it's not long till
