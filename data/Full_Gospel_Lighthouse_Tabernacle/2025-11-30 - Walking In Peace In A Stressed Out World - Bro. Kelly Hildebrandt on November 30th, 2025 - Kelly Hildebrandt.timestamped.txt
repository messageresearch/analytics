[27:10] Every request, Father, and every hand
[27:12] that was raised, Lord, to humanity,
[27:15] there seems to be, oh, this is a small

[37:07] There's A city
[37:10] of light.
[37:12] Oh, where there's coming.
[37:15] No night.
[37:18] Oh, and the sun
[37:21] ever sets
[37:24] in the sky.
[37:28] Oh, in Bible
[37:32] we're told.
[37:34] Oh, that the streets
[37:37] are purest gold.
[37:40] Oh, and the cool
[37:43] dead river
[37:46] runs by
[37:52] that city.
[37:54] God's holy
[37:57] wise.
[38:00] Oh, yes I am.
[38:02] I'll never turn back
[38:06] to this world
[38:09] anymore.
[38:14] No matter how rough
[38:17] may be the way.
[38:20] No matter how long
[38:22] I stop to pray,
[38:25] I'll come through that tear
[38:29] on that ever
[38:31] green show.
[38:37] Now the bride from every age.
[38:43] Oh, sing God's
[38:45] amazing grace.
[38:48] Oh, and you strong
[38:52] to the city
[38:55] of God.
[39:00] Oh, there's no dying
[39:04] up there.
[39:06] Oh, and no burdens
[39:10] to bear.
[39:12] And nobody
[39:15] will be feeding.
[39:23] I'm down for that city.
[39:27] God's holy
[39:29] wise city.
[39:32] Oh yes, I am.
[39:35] I'll never turn back
[39:38] to this world.
[39:42] anymore.
[39:46] No matter how rough
[39:49] may be the way.
[39:52] No matter how long
[39:55] I stop to pray,
[39:58] I'll come
[40:02] on that ever
[40:04] rejoice.
[40:10] I'm back for that city.
[40:13] Oh, God's holy
[40:16] wide city.
[40:19] Oh yes, I am.
[40:22] I'll never turn back
[40:25] to this world
[40:28] anymore.
[40:33] No matter how rough
[40:36] may be the way.
[40:39] No matter how long
[40:42] I stop to pray,
[40:45] I'll bow through that ceiling
[40:48] for that ever.
[40:57] No matter how rough
[41:00] may be the way,
[41:03] no matter how long
[41:06] I stop to pray,
[41:09] I'm down through that city
[41:12] on that ever
[41:15] green
[41:17] shore.
[41:29] I wanted
[41:38] sorry I wanted to sing that for my
[41:40] grandma Shlet's 89th birthday which will
[41:42] be Tuesday.
[41:49] Amen. God bless you sister Margie. Amen.
[41:52] My goodness. The angels are going to
[41:54] have to stand back when we all stand
[41:55] there and start singing Amazing Grace.
[41:58] &gt;&gt; I believe I'm gonna let some of these
[41:59] sisters just go ahead and take over.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; But I'm gonna have my turn when I get
[42:04] there on that side, too.
[42:06] &gt;&gt; Ain't it good to be a Christian?
[42:08] &gt;&gt; Ain't it good to know where you headed
[42:10] for? You're bound for a city. Oh my my
[42:14] goodness. What a blessing it was last
[42:16] weekend or last last evening to be in
[42:19] the presence of the Lord. Wasn't it a
[42:21] wonderful time just to sit here and to
[42:23] bask in the presence of the almighty
[42:25] God? Me and brother Titus, we were
[42:28] running a business deal on uh Friday and
[42:30] we were listening to the prophet and
[42:32] question and answers and and he was
[42:34] talking about God preparing a way and
[42:36] there in 1964 and he said he said for
[42:39] Noah he said God prepared him an ark. He
[42:41] said but he said if he didn't he said he
[42:43] would have made Noah walk on the water
[42:45] or put some log out there. Amen.
[42:47] &gt;&gt; You see, God's got a way. No matter what
[42:50] it is, he is the way, the truth, and the
[42:52] life. And I'm thankful that God's got a
[42:54] prepared way for this for this hour that
[42:56] we're living in. Well, you say, "What is
[42:58] that way, Brother Andrew?" I say, "It's
[42:59] a message of the hour. It's the prepared
[43:02] way of the Lord." And I'm looking
[43:04] forward to what God has in store for us
[43:06] this morning. Aren't you?
[43:08] &gt;&gt; It's been our It's been an awesome honor
[43:10] to have Brother Kelly Hilderbrandt
[43:11] throughout many years. He's been a bosom
[43:13] friend to each of us. It was the first
[43:16] place that I and brother Matthew went uh
[43:20] especially myself after I give my heart
[43:22] to the Lord and it just sticks out in my
[43:24] mind being there with brother Kelly and
[43:26] brother Kelly has the ability to leave
[43:28] such an impact on your life and our our
[43:32] family and this church has been graced
[43:34] throughout many years to have brother
[43:36] Hilderbrandt come here and speak for us
[43:38] and we don't want to take those things
[43:39] for granted as as we said last night we
[43:42] watched a statesman as he began to
[43:44] preach and deliver the word of God. We
[43:46] saw God come down and vindicate his
[43:48] word. And I believe he's that kind of a
[43:50] God today that he can touch every single
[43:53] one of our needs here. Amen. Let's just
[43:56] stand to our feet. Prepare to worship
[43:58] just a minute. Kia G, he's kept me
[44:00] alive. Amen. Oh, he kept me alive. The
[44:06] Lord has kept me alive through all the
[44:09] years. He's kept me alive. But I'm just
[44:13] as strong as the day that he sent me.
[44:16] Oh, even though the devil thought I'd
[44:18] give up, he never survived.
[44:23] The Lord has kept me alive.
[44:26] He kept me alive. The Lord has kept me
[44:29] alive through all the years. He's kept
[44:33] me alive. Well, I'm just as strong as
[44:36] the day that he sent me. Even though the
[44:40] devil thought I'd give up, he never
[44:43] survived.
[44:45] The Lord has kept me alive.
[44:49] Caleb was a man who was there from the
[44:52] start. He followed the Lord with all of
[44:56] his heart. He's the one who said we're
[44:59] more than able to take the land.
[45:04] Well, he came through the wilderness to
[45:07] thick and threw thin. He even seen a lot
[45:11] of people fall into sin. But after it
[45:14] all, he wanted everyone to understand.
[45:20] Well, he's kept me alive. The Lord has
[45:24] kept me alive through all the years.
[45:27] He's kept me alive. Well, I'm just as
[45:30] strong as the day that he sent me. Even
[45:34] though the devil thought I'd give up and
[45:37] never survived,
[45:40] the Lord has kept me alive.
[46:03] Well, I look at the years, the victories
[46:07] won. I stand amazed at all God has done.
[46:12] Now, whom shall we fear? We're more than
[46:14] able to take the land.
[46:18] Oh, all the storms we giants have fell.
[46:22] We've been at war with Satan, the powers
[46:25] of hell. But by the grace of God, we're
[46:28] all standing and here to tell.
[46:33] Oh, he kept me alive. The Lord's kept me
[46:37] alive.
[46:39] Through all the years, he's kept me
[46:41] alive. Well, I'm just as strong as the
[46:45] day that he sent me. Oh, even though the
[46:48] devil thought I'd give up and never
[46:50] survive,
[46:53] the Lord has kept me alive. Well, David
[46:58] was a man who was after God's heart. He
[47:01] worshiped the Lord with all of his
[47:04] might. He knew goodness, mercy would
[47:07] follow him all of his days.
[47:12] Well, when Goliath came with a spirit
[47:16] and sword, but David, he came in the
[47:19] name of the Lord. And after it all, God
[47:23] made Goliath bow.
[47:28] Oh, he kept me alive. The Lord's kept me
[47:32] alive through all the years. He's kept
[47:36] me alive. Well, I'm just as strong as
[47:39] the day that he sent me. Even though the
[47:43] devil thought I'd give up and never
[47:45] survive,
[47:48] the Lord has kept me alive.
[47:52] Hallelujah.
[47:55] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[47:57] Well, every time I tried to make it on
[48:02] my own,
[48:05] and every time I try to stand
[48:10] to fall
[48:13] and all those lonely roads that I
[48:18] traveled on,
[48:22] well, there was Jesus.
[48:30] Oh, with the life I build came crashing
[48:34] to the ground.
[48:38] Oh, with the friends I have nowhere to
[48:43] be found.
[48:47] I couldn't see it then, but I can see it
[48:52] now.
[48:56] Well, there was Jesus.
[48:59] Aren't you thankful that he's always
[49:01] there?
[49:04] Oh, in the waiting,
[49:07] in the searching, in the healing and the
[49:12] hurting,
[49:13] like a blessing
[49:16] in the broken pieces.
[49:22] Every minute,
[49:24] every moment where I'm
[49:27] where I'm going,
[49:30] even when I didn't know it, who couldn't
[49:34] see it.
[49:37] There was Jesus
[49:43] for this man who needs amazing kind of
[49:47] grace.
[49:52] forgiveness at a price I I couldn't pay.
[49:59] Well, I'm not perfect, so I thank God
[50:04] every day.
[50:07] Oh, there was Jesus.
[50:12] Oh, hallelujah.
[50:16] Oh, in the waiting,
[50:18] in the search, in the healing and the
[50:23] hurting,
[50:25] like the blessings
[50:27] in the broken pieces.
[50:33] every minute,
[50:35] every moment of where I'm where I'm
[50:40] going.
[50:42] Even when I didn't know or couldn't see
[50:47] it.
[50:48] Oh, there was Jesus
[50:52] on the mountains,
[50:54] in the valleys,
[51:00] &gt;&gt; in the shadows
[51:03] of the alleys.
[51:08] Oh, in the fire in the blood
[51:18] always is and always was
[51:24] in the waiting,
[51:26] in the search, in the healing and the
[51:31] hurting.
[51:32] like a blessing buried in the broken
[51:37] pieces.
[51:41] Every minute,
[51:43] every moment of where I'm
[51:47] where I'm going,
[51:49] even when I didn't know it or couldn't
[51:54] see it.
[51:56] Oh, there was Jesus
[52:00] on the mountains
[52:02] in the valleys.
[52:05] Can you identify that? He's been right
[52:07] there all the time in the shadows
[52:10] of the alleys.
[52:16] Oh, in the fire, in the blood.
[52:25] always is and always was. No, I'm never
[52:30] going to walk alone in the waiting,
[52:34] in the searching, in the healing and the
[52:39] hurting
[52:40] like a blessing.
[52:53] I can where I'm going
[52:57] and where I
[53:05] was Jesus.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful that he's always
[53:12] with you?
[53:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. He promised to be with us even in
[53:17] us till the end of the world.
[53:19] We can certainly say that with all of
[53:21] our heart.
[53:22] Amen. If you have a need on your heart
[53:24] this morning with an uplifted hand as we
[53:26] would look to the Lord in prayer today.
[53:28] Lord Jesus, we
[53:31] say this morning our Lord, we love you
[53:32] with all of our heart.
[53:36] Doesn't matter where we are, Father.
[53:38] We're in the valleys on the mountains.
[53:42] You're always with your children, Lord.
[53:48] The prophet said in the church age book
[53:50] that
[53:52] how do we know that you're with us? It's
[53:54] because you promised it and you said
[53:56] that you were.
[53:58] There's no other court of appeal, Lord,
[54:00] but your word, Lord.
[54:03] I pray, Father, as the spirit is moving
[54:05] even this morning, Lord, that you would
[54:07] meet every need of each person that
[54:09] would be represented here,
[54:11] those that would be streaming online
[54:13] today, Lord. Would you minister, Lord,
[54:14] to the need that they would have in
[54:16] their heart and in their life?
[54:19] And Lord, we believe in the
[54:21] supernatural, Lord, because you are a
[54:23] supernatural God.
[54:25] Be with the sick, Lord. Be with
[54:26] afflicted, Father.
[54:29] be with our assembly back home, Lord, as
[54:31] they're preparing for for uh church
[54:33] themselves, Lord. May the spirit of God
[54:36] move amongst the people.
[54:39] Bless this church, Lord. Bless the
[54:41] ministry of it, Father. Each person has
[54:44] come with their lick of fire, Lord. May
[54:46] we leave here, Lord, a better people,
[54:48] Lord, to serve you more fully, Lord.
[54:52] I commit myself unto you, Lord, soul,
[54:54] body, and spirit for the glory of God
[54:56] that you would have your way this
[54:57] morning hour. Lord, take control of
[55:00] humanity. Father, we commit ourselves
[55:02] unto you now for the glory of Jesus
[55:04] Christ. In Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[55:09] Amen. Why don't you take the opportunity
[55:11] to shake somebody's hand beside you,
[55:13] around you, or behind you, and lead each
[55:16] other each other know that you love them
[55:18] with all their heart.
[55:22] Amen. Isn't the Lord good to us this
[55:24] morning?
[55:26] Amen. God bless you all.
[55:30] I say good morning to you all.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; It's good to be in the house of the Lord
[55:35] this morning. Good to see each and every
[55:37] one of you that are here today. And a
[55:40] little cooler out this morning. And I'm
[55:43] not used to the humidity. So, the
[55:44] humidity gets me pretty bad. But
[55:48] back home this morning, I had a message
[55:50] from one of the PE of one of our
[55:53] brothers from the church and minus one
[55:56] Fahrenheit. So, we're a little cooler
[55:57] than what you are, but
[56:00] so I'll I'll take this a little bit of
[56:02] humidity and
[56:06] I don't have to bundle up like a polar
[56:08] bear to go outside.
[56:10] It's a little cool at home, but our
[56:12] church sends our greetings to you and
[56:14] and we're thankful that we have warm
[56:16] buildings and we have places that we can
[56:19] gather together where where the Lord can
[56:21] move amongst his people. It's just good
[56:23] to be back in the house of the Lord with
[56:25] you. I feel like David has said, it's
[56:27] good to be in the house of the Lord.
[56:30] Amen. I don't know what better place to
[56:31] be than than right here. Amen. Sister
[56:35] Meer and myself once again we just like
[56:36] to thank you for your hospitality and
[56:38] for all that you've done for us and all
[56:42] the sweets that are coming in and
[56:44] everybody said you have to eat them all
[56:46] yourself brother Kelly I said nope I
[56:48] said we got only one size of pants with
[56:50] us and that's what we want to leave with
[56:52] and we certainly do appreciate all of
[56:55] your hospitality God bless you for it.
[56:58] Amen. One day we won't have to gather
[57:00] like this anymore.
[57:02] We'll be gathering father's house and
[57:05] it's going to be a grand time. Each one
[57:07] of us going to look like these young men
[57:08] on the front row here, 21 years old, 20
[57:11] years old. It's going to be a great
[57:13] great thing. Amen. I always say it's
[57:16] going to be the biggest young people
[57:17] meeting that we'll ever go to. And
[57:20] that's one place I don't want to miss.
[57:23] And we're doing our part by the grace of
[57:25] God. And we can say with thoughts of
[57:27] grace that we can count oursel as one of
[57:29] the number that will be there on that
[57:31] particular day. Amen. If I don't see on
[57:34] this side of glory,
[57:36] well, we look forward to the other side.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm just glad that there's some
[57:41] people I'm acquainted with here on the
[57:42] earth that when we get over there, we'll
[57:45] be able to shake one another's hand and
[57:47] and we'll all have the same testimony.
[57:49] We all made it by the grace of almighty
[57:51] God. It's not by any works that we have,
[57:54] but it's solely by the grace of Jesus
[57:56] Christ in each one of our lives. Amen.
[58:01] This morning, I'm going to speak a a
[58:02] message if you want to turn to your
[58:04] Bibles in Philippians chapter 4 verse 6
[58:06] and 7.
[58:09] I paced the floors last night. I paced
[58:11] the floors early in this morning and was
[58:15] looking to the Lord on what would be his
[58:18] mind to speak today. Uh I don't take it
[58:21] for granted just to stand here. I uh I
[58:24] look at Lord give me something that
[58:26] would help the people, make you real to
[58:29] the people. And I maybe an unusual title
[58:32] today, but I trust that it will be a
[58:34] blessing to you.
[58:36] Walking in peace in a stressed out
[58:38] world.
[58:40] Walking in peace in a stressed out
[58:42] world.
[58:44] Philippians 4 6 and 7 says be careful
[58:46] for nothing but in everything. Let's say
[58:50] everything.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; Everything
[58:51] &gt;&gt; by prayer and supplication with
[58:53] thanksgiving
[58:55] let your requests be known unto God.
[58:58] Doesn't say in here that we should be
[59:00] downtrodden but it says with
[59:02] thanksgiving.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; I love the next verse. And the peace of
[59:07] God which passes all that say all.
[59:10] All our understanding shall keep your
[59:12] hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.
[59:15] Also, I'd like to read Proverbs chapter
[59:17] 18 verses 10 this morning if we may.
[59:22] The name of the Lord is a strong tower
[59:24] and the righteous run into it and it's
[59:28] safe. Amen. God bless you. You may have
[59:30] your seats this morning.
[59:33] We live in an incredible time. It's a
[59:36] time that the sages of old have wanted
[59:39] to live in.
[59:41] But it's an incredible age. It's an age
[59:44] where people are stressed out.
[59:48] Uh it doesn't matter who you talk to or
[59:50] where you go.
[59:53] I've had children as young as 10 years
[59:54] old talking to them and trying to
[59:57] counsel with them. They say, "Brother
[59:58] Kelly, I'm just stressed."
[1:00:00] I'm like, "What? How can you be stressed
[1:00:02] at 10 years old?
[1:00:05] You got food every day. You got a warm
[1:00:07] place to lay your head. I hope the young
[1:00:09] people are listening.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; Everything's provided for you. And yet
[1:00:14] you're stressed to the nines. And what
[1:00:17] can you be so stressed about? Brother
[1:00:19] Brandham preached a message called
[1:00:20] letting off the pressure. And he also
[1:00:23] preached a message called Countdown. In
[1:00:25] the beginning of the one he preached in
[1:00:26] Jeffersonville, he said there's a
[1:00:28] pressure on the people today. And that
[1:00:29] pressure has no limitation or
[1:00:32] denominational lines. It has no age
[1:00:34] limit. It has no respect of persons.
[1:00:38] It's on young and old, good and bad.
[1:00:39] It's on everybody. Pressure. We're
[1:00:42] living in a neurotic age. Nervous
[1:00:44] tension. Everybody is racing here and
[1:00:47] going there and going nowhere. It's just
[1:00:49] to that kind of an age. I know this
[1:00:51] church would be plagued with it. And
[1:00:54] everywhere is plagued with it.
[1:00:55] Tabernacle is plagued with it
[1:00:57] everywhere. The whole world. It's a day
[1:00:58] of pressure. Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry,
[1:01:02] hurry up.
[1:01:04] and wait.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; It seems like that kind of rings true in
[1:01:11] the hour that we're living in.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; Drive 90 miles an hour and then get home
[1:01:16] for supper and wait 2 hour till it gets
[1:01:18] it.
[1:01:20] That's right. It's a time. It's in that
[1:01:22] rushing and speeding. It's just gets you
[1:01:25] to nervous tension.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; It's a thought. This thought that we're
[1:01:30] speaking of today, it it kind of
[1:01:32] captivates you and brings you into
[1:01:33] reality of walking in two worlds at the
[1:01:36] same time. We're walking in the natural
[1:01:39] world and we're walking in a
[1:01:41] supernatural world at the same time.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; But the everyday life which pulls us in
[1:01:48] many different directions and we face
[1:01:50] the pressures of life. I I I don't know
[1:01:52] maybe in America you don't face any
[1:01:54] pressures but in Canada we got a lot of
[1:01:56] pressure.
[1:01:57] There's pressure. There's deadlines you
[1:02:00] have to meet. There's responsibilities.
[1:02:02] There's decisions. There's spiritual
[1:02:04] warfare. Stress is real.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; We all feel it. We all go through it day
[1:02:09] by day. And sometimes we wonder uh when
[1:02:14] when we sing and we sing these wonderful
[1:02:16] songs and they give us such an
[1:02:17] encouragement.
[1:02:19] Amen. That God is with us in the
[1:02:21] mountains and in the valleys. No matter
[1:02:23] where we are, God is with us. But yet
[1:02:25] when we when we face the world and we're
[1:02:27] out of church at that moment, all of a
[1:02:29] sudden it seems like stress just
[1:02:30] overwhelms us many times. And actually
[1:02:33] can cause a lot of distress in the home.
[1:02:37] As I mentioned before, one of the young
[1:02:40] girl asked me said to me, "I'm
[1:02:42] completely stressed out." And I'm like,
[1:02:44] "How can you be stressed?
[1:02:46] Nothing to worry about really." But it's
[1:02:49] this age that we're living in. And the
[1:02:51] more computerized we become and the more
[1:02:53] electronic we become and the more the
[1:02:55] more conveniences we have and the more
[1:02:57] things that we have available to us the
[1:02:59] more stressed out we get.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; The dictionary meaning for stress for
[1:03:05] stress means a constraining force or
[1:03:07] influence. It means a mental tension
[1:03:11] just like a pressure that's upon the
[1:03:13] people. It means to be tense, anxious,
[1:03:16] or exhausted as a result of pressure,
[1:03:18] mental stress, or overworked. Amen. You
[1:03:21] probably hear that today. I I was
[1:03:23] hearing it back home. Is that that some
[1:03:25] of the jobs some of the brothers are
[1:03:26] working on, the people that are working
[1:03:28] on get half the work done that they got
[1:03:30] done 20 years ago, and everybody's
[1:03:32] stressed out, but seemingly they can't
[1:03:34] get anything hardly done at all anymore
[1:03:36] because of the stress they're under.
[1:03:39] I looked up Gallup poll 2021 and at that
[1:03:43] time it said 42% of adults worldwide are
[1:03:46] experiencing stress. That was in two
[1:03:50] 2021 in American psych psychological
[1:03:53] 2024 it said twothirds of adults
[1:03:56] reported feeling stressed or anxious.
[1:04:00] You they have to have a a pill to get
[1:04:02] them up and a pill to get them down.
[1:04:04] Amen. Everybody is feeling it. it it
[1:04:07] becomes something and we're not careful,
[1:04:08] we drag it with us into our home and
[1:04:10] cause a nervous tension in the home and
[1:04:12] the children get nervous tension over it
[1:04:14] and but there is a hope church and that
[1:04:17] hope only lies in one person and brother
[1:04:20] Andrew referred to him this morning.
[1:04:21] It's in Jesus Christ.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you want peace, if we want
[1:04:25] peace, there's only if you turn on the
[1:04:27] prophet's message, it seems like it just
[1:04:29] brings a calm into the room and it just
[1:04:31] reduces the pressure. You turn on a good
[1:04:34] good singing uh good music and something
[1:04:37] transpires. It's just something that
[1:04:39] puts you into a different kind of an
[1:04:41] atmosphere. Amen. Why do we sing? We
[1:04:44] come to church so we forget about the
[1:04:46] problems of life and we can tune in with
[1:04:48] a that the spirit of God can minister to
[1:04:51] our every need that we would have. Amen.
[1:04:54] They said specifically stress was
[1:04:56] concerning the economy along with world
[1:04:59] events and technology. The more
[1:05:02] connected we are, the more we realize
[1:05:03] what's happening in the world, there's
[1:05:05] more stress people come out. What's
[1:05:06] going to happen with this nation or
[1:05:08] what's going to happen with that nation?
[1:05:10] I I look at it, I want to know what's
[1:05:12] going to happen with myself. I want to
[1:05:14] make it to the other side. Amen. My
[1:05:17] whole goal in life is is a body change.
[1:05:20] And and I've never stepped off of that.
[1:05:22] I I've right from the time I've been a
[1:05:24] little child, grew up in a message
[1:05:26] church, a body change is what I've heard
[1:05:28] of all my life. And I I'm looking
[1:05:30] forward to that body change because one
[1:05:33] day and I say one day soon it's going to
[1:05:35] transpire. The world is gathering
[1:05:37] together. The world is trying to bring
[1:05:40] peace and safety. But the more peace
[1:05:42] they bring try to bring the more
[1:05:44] stressed out the people become. But
[1:05:46] there is a bride of the Lord Jesus
[1:05:48] Christ that is worldwide. Amen. Who are
[1:05:50] founded in Christ Jesus. And we have a
[1:05:52] place to let off the pressure.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank God for a place to let off
[1:05:58] the pressure.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Somebody say, "Praise the Lord."
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; The Bible tells us in St. Luke is that
[1:06:05] men's hearts are failing them for fear
[1:06:07] and for looking after those things which
[1:06:09] are coming on the earth. For the powers
[1:06:11] of heaven shall be shaken. Even
[1:06:14] believers, we feel the stress that of
[1:06:16] life. But there's the reality where we
[1:06:19] can let off the pressure which is a
[1:06:20] hidden life in Christ. Amen. In the
[1:06:23] midst of life, a child of God can walk
[1:06:26] in peace.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Aren't you thankful for that?
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can be pressed but not
[1:06:33] crushed.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; You can be troubled but not distressed.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; You can be stressed out, but you're
[1:06:40] still standing.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. It don't matter what the devil
[1:06:44] brings, he ain't enough.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; Because peace is an absence of pressure.
[1:06:49] Sometimes people think when I when they
[1:06:51] come into the message that's the absence
[1:06:53] of pressure. That's when it begins.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; That's when life starts to get difficult
[1:06:57] because all the guns of hell are trained
[1:07:00] right on you.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's a time when you got to
[1:07:03] really know who you are in Christ and
[1:07:05] that Christ is in your heart and you're
[1:07:07] filled with the Holy Ghost. Amen. Or the
[1:07:09] pressures of life will come crushing
[1:07:11] down on you.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm glad for the presence of the
[1:07:15] Prince of Peace.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's the one that I want walking
[1:07:19] beside me through the day.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:23] St. John 16:33 says, "In the world you
[1:07:25] shall have tribulation, but be of good
[1:07:28] cheer." Jesus said, "I have overcome the
[1:07:30] world."
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. In 2 Timothy 3:1, excuse me for a
[1:07:35] lot of scripture, but we can get find we
[1:07:37] can find great find strength in
[1:07:40] scripture.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. In 2 Timothy 3, it says, "In the
[1:07:43] last days, perilous time shall come."
[1:07:46] We're certainly in the last days.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; I don't know about yourself, but if you
[1:07:50] listen to just a moment of the news, you
[1:07:53] can you hear the things that are
[1:07:55] transpiring. We know we're in the last
[1:07:56] days. There's wars and rumors of wars.
[1:07:59] There's earthquakes and and in all kinds
[1:08:01] of places or there's floods. There's
[1:08:04] there's there's disasters everywhere.
[1:08:07] Amen. But in all of that, the bride is
[1:08:09] walking with something in her heart.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. With bounce on your heel. Amen.
[1:08:14] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[1:08:17] today, and forever.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; And even though the three Hebrew
[1:08:20] children, they were facing the fiery
[1:08:22] flames of affliction of their day and
[1:08:24] King Nebuchadnezzar was going to put
[1:08:26] them into the fire, but I believe there
[1:08:28] was a peace within their heart. Though
[1:08:30] God, I know God is able to deliver me,
[1:08:33] but nevertheless, I'm not bowing down to
[1:08:36] Satan's kingdom. I'm not bowing down to
[1:08:38] Satan's Eden. I'm going all the way
[1:08:41] through. Amen. There's a song Brother
[1:08:43] Wendell sang in our church. I'm going
[1:08:45] all the way through. There's no turning
[1:08:48] back for a Christian. Amen. We're going
[1:08:51] all the way. Let's say, I'm going all
[1:08:52] the way this morning. Let's say it one
[1:08:55] more time with passion this morning. I'm
[1:08:57] going all the way this morning. There's
[1:08:59] no turning back for a Christian. Amen.
[1:09:02] It doesn't matter HOW MUCH STRESS YOU'RE
[1:09:04] UNDER. Jesus Christ is enough in your
[1:09:07] heart. He's enough in your life.
[1:09:12] Perilous times means stressful, pressure
[1:09:15] field. It means chaotic.
[1:09:17] The world is stressed.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; Brother Jonas, our son, he has people
[1:09:24] that work for him and there's people
[1:09:26] taking off constantly for stress leave
[1:09:29] and they don't know what's going to
[1:09:30] happen in the world. But the thing that
[1:09:31] gives you peace is what they don't want
[1:09:33] in their life.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; They're they're they they're like the
[1:09:37] the world is overloaded,
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; right? The world is overstimulated.
[1:09:42] They're trying to stimulate their senses
[1:09:44] and trying to find some peace in that.
[1:09:47] They're fearful.
[1:09:49] They're exhausted.
[1:09:51] Amen. They're discouraged. They're
[1:09:53] filled with anxiety. But the bride is
[1:09:55] called to be still.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; Be still and know that I'm God.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; The bride is called to be calm. God is
[1:10:03] in control of every aspect of your life.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if he's the one that wrote
[1:10:08] your name in the Lamb's book of life
[1:10:10] before the foundation of the world, he
[1:10:12] knows exactly what you're going through
[1:10:14] right now. Amen. He knows all about it.
[1:10:18] His hand is over you. He's He's over top
[1:10:21] of you. He's watching you sometimes to
[1:10:24] say, "Lord, just keep pushing me along."
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're anchored like a tree that's
[1:10:30] planted by the living waters. We're
[1:10:32] resting on God's promises.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're rooted in the word.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're walking in the revelation of
[1:10:40] the hour of today.
[1:10:43] Amen. We're in a city of refuge and we
[1:10:46] know Christ is our refuge.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; When brother Brandon was preaching
[1:10:50] preaching the message on on on letting
[1:10:53] off the pressure. He he was talking
[1:10:55] about the city of refuge that they had
[1:10:57] in the Old Testament times and and how
[1:11:00] that if if you had killed somebody or
[1:11:01] done something, you would try to get to
[1:11:03] that city as quickly as you could
[1:11:05] because the your your adversaries were
[1:11:08] coming behind you to take your life and
[1:11:10] you would plead your case and once you
[1:11:12] were in the door, you could let off the
[1:11:14] pressure. Amen. But he said that we have
[1:11:17] that pressure place where we can bring
[1:11:19] all of our needs to and that's the Jesus
[1:11:21] Christ. Amen. Many times we come to him
[1:11:24] with our burdens. And I've seen people
[1:11:26] lay down their burdens at the altar and
[1:11:28] before they leave the back of the
[1:11:29] church, they pack them up with them
[1:11:31] again. They go home complaining and
[1:11:33] disgruntled and and talking about this
[1:11:36] and TALKING ABOUT THAT, BUT never
[1:11:38] breathing the word. Thank you, Lord, for
[1:11:40] deliverance. Thank you, Lord, for
[1:11:41] setting me free. Thank you, LORD, FOR
[1:11:43] TAKING THESE BURDENS OFF ME. AMEN. THANK
[1:11:46] YOU, LORD, FOR WHAT YOU'RE DOING FOR ME.
[1:11:48] THANK YOU, LORD, FOR A SOUND MIND. THANK
[1:11:50] YOU, LORD, FOR PEACE IN MY HEART. THANK
[1:11:52] YOU, LORD, FOR JOY IN MY HEART.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WE'D RATHER COMPLAIN THAN THAN
[1:11:58] HAVE THE PEACE OF GOD. AND I SAY, LET'S
[1:12:00] PUT ASIDE ALL OF OUR COMPLAINING. AMEN.
[1:12:02] YOUR BROTHER'S NOT THE PROBLEM. YOUR
[1:12:04] SISTER'S NOT THE PROBLEM. YOUR HUSBAND'S
[1:12:07] NOT THE PROBLEM. YOUR WIFE'S NOT THE
[1:12:09] PROBLEM. YOU'RE THE PROBLEM. WHEN you
[1:12:11] look in the mirror in the morning, Amen.
[1:12:13] IF WE CAN GET OURSELVES OUT OF THE WAY,
[1:12:15] WE CAN LET OFF THE PRESSURE.
[1:12:19] AMEN. Do you believe that this morning?
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; Stress comes from overthinking.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; Stress comes from the fear of the
[1:12:29] future.
[1:12:32] Stress comes from trying to figure out
[1:12:33] outcomes.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; I don't know if I'm on the on the
[1:12:36] rubbers on the road or not, but this
[1:12:38] what the Lord laid on my heart.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Andy was praying last
[1:12:43] night and and when he was talking to the
[1:12:46] congregation at the end of the service,
[1:12:47] hoping that Brother Kelly would have
[1:12:48] something for from the Lord in the
[1:12:50] morning that he'd be up all night long
[1:12:52] trying to search for him. Amen. It's
[1:12:54] sometimes not good when brothers pray
[1:12:56] like that
[1:12:58] because what happens that's what happens
[1:13:02] and you're saying, "Lord, what should I
[1:13:04] bring to the people?" And and and and
[1:13:06] this is something that has been so in my
[1:13:09] own life. Amen. In in my Christian walk
[1:13:12] with the Lord, if a person's not
[1:13:13] careful, stress will overtake you in
[1:13:15] everything you do.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; And the world becomes a very negative
[1:13:19] place
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; and it becomes very negative around
[1:13:22] self.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. And people can find that
[1:13:25] negativism actually transmitting from
[1:13:27] your own self. But you have somebody
[1:13:29] that's always joyful.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. You ask somebody in the morning,
[1:13:33] "How are you doing this morning?" Say,
[1:13:34] "I'm doing great."
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; The next day you ask them, "How are you
[1:13:37] doing? You doing HOW CAN YOU BE DOING
[1:13:39] GREAT EVERY DAY? It's good to be alive.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; It's good to know THAT JESUS IS IN MY
[1:13:44] CORNER.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; It's good TO KNOW THAT GOD HAS TAKEN
[1:13:47] care of everything that I have need of
[1:13:48] spiritually.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. HE'S GIVEN ME POWER. HE'S GIVEN ME
[1:13:52] THE fortitude to work to provide a
[1:13:55] living for our families.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHAT DOES IT THE PEACE OF GOD IN
[1:14:00] OUR HEART? IF WE WENT THROUGH LIFE NOT
[1:14:02] KNOWING WHAT TOMORROW WOULD BE, IT WOULD
[1:14:04] BE a dangerous place to live in. Amen.
[1:14:06] WE WOULD TRY TO PUT OURSELVES IN A BOX.
[1:14:08] BUT I'M SO THANKFUL AS THE BRIDE OF
[1:14:10] JESUS CHRIST, WE CAN GET STILL BEFORE
[1:14:13] ALMIGHTY GOD. WE KNOW OUR POSITION IN
[1:14:16] CHRIST, WE'VE GOT THE INDWELLING OF THE
[1:14:18] HOLY SPIRIT WITH INSIDE OF OUR HEART.
[1:14:21] AMEN. AND WE'RE WALKING IN VICTORY EVERY
[1:14:23] SINGLE MOMENT OF THE DAY.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; AMEN. When you wake up in the morning,
[1:14:28] THE DEVIL THAT'S ASSIGNED TO YOU SHOULD
[1:14:30] BE THE ONE THAT'S STRESSED OUT. DON'T
[1:14:32] LET HIM GET YOU STRESSED OUT. YOU LET
[1:14:34] THE DEVIL BE STRESSED OUT WHEN HE'S ON
[1:14:36] YOUR GUARD.
[1:14:39] HALLELUJAH.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; I say he's the one that's stressed.
[1:14:46] Should be stressed.
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; Stress comes and we try to control what
[1:14:51] only God can control.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; We worry about outcomes instead of
[1:14:56] trusting God's oversight.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm just trying to go through some
[1:15:00] points.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; We magnify problems and mini minimize
[1:15:05] the promises of the word of God. Amen.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see it happen all the time.
[1:15:10] People are want to focus more on their
[1:15:12] problem what they do on the promise of
[1:15:14] God.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus said in St. Matthew 6:27,
[1:15:18] "Which of you by taking a thought can
[1:15:20] add one cubic onto his stature?" And we
[1:15:23] say that not one of us can do anything.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. But I read in the Bible is that
[1:15:28] he's watching over the sparrows.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; He knows exactly how much they need to
[1:15:33] feed. And I I WATCH THEM IN MY BACKYARD
[1:15:35] AND I SAY, "LORD, it seems like they
[1:15:37] don't have a care in the world." Amen.
[1:15:40] They sit on the tree and they're they're
[1:15:42] chirping away and they're GIVING PRAISE
[1:15:43] ON TO ALMIGHTY GOD. AND WE'RE SITTING IN
[1:15:46] THIS BEAUTIFUL PLACE AND IN OUR NICE,
[1:15:48] BEAUTIFUL CHAIRS WITH A FIREPLACE ON AND
[1:15:51] WE'RE STRESSED OUT. AND I SAY, "GOD,
[1:15:53] HELP US NOT TO BE STRESSED OUT." AMEN.
[1:15:56] HELP US TO LOOK AT THE PROMISE OF GOD.
[1:15:58] May we be REMINDED THIS MORNING HOUR.
[1:16:01] AMEN. TRUST IN ALMIGHTY GOD. DON'T TRUST
[1:16:04] IN THE ARM OF MAN, BUT TRUST IN ALMIGHTY
[1:16:07] GOD. AMEN. Man will FAIL YOU, BUT GOD.
[1:16:10] LET'S SAY GOD. GOD GOD WILL NEVER FAIL
[1:16:13] YOU. HE'S PROMISED NEVER TO fail you.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; You have to trust in him.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; We often think we can fix this or fix
[1:16:22] that only to figure out that we can't do
[1:16:24] anything about it. We try. The more we
[1:16:28] try, the heavier the stress becomes in
[1:16:30] our life. Because peace doesn't come
[1:16:32] from control. Peace comes from release.
[1:16:37] You get peace when you release. The
[1:16:38] Bible tells us in 2 Corinth Corinthians
[1:16:41] 10, casting down, let's say, casting
[1:16:44] down. Casting down imagination AND
[1:16:47] BRINGING EVERY THOUGHT INTO the
[1:16:48] captivity of Christ. Amen. That's what
[1:16:51] we're to do. WE'RE TO CAST DOWN
[1:16:53] EVERYTHING THAT'S NOT OF GOD.
[1:16:56] Cast down our pride.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Cast down all of our hard
[1:17:01] feelings.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; Cast down THE THOUGHT THAT BROTHER SO
[1:17:05] AND SO NEVER SHOOK my hand Sunday
[1:17:07] morning or sister SO AND SO THEY MUST
[1:17:09] HAVE SOMETHING AGAINST ME. CAST IT DOWN
[1:17:12] AND GET IT OUT OF YOUR MIND. DON'T GIVE
[1:17:14] THE DEVIL ONE THOUGHT OR ONE ROOM. AMEN.
[1:17:17] TO GET INTO ANY OF THE CRACKS. I SAY
[1:17:20] CAST IT OUT.
[1:17:23] You'll see that YOU'LL GET PEACE IN YOUR
[1:17:25] HEART. But when you start to keep ON
[1:17:27] KEEP THOSE THINGS IN YOUR HEART, YOUR
[1:17:29] MIND GETS ALL STRESSED OUT. THERE'S NO
[1:17:31] PEACE IN YOUR SOUL. YOU'RE WALKING
[1:17:33] THROUGH LIFE. BUT PRAISE BE THE NAME OF
[1:17:36] THE LORD. WE CAN COME TO THE HOUSE OF
[1:17:38] ALMIGHTY GOD. AMEN. AND THE WORD OF GOD
[1:17:41] CAN BE OUR REFUGE PLACE.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that this morning?
[1:17:51] You can't control everything around you,
[1:17:53] but you certainly can control what's
[1:17:55] inside of you.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham told us that the
[1:17:59] the hand or the the bird wants to make a
[1:18:01] roost. He said, "But he said, but we
[1:18:04] don't have to let him make a roost.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; We can tear it down."
[1:18:09] Isaiah 26:3, it says, "I will keep him
[1:18:11] in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on
[1:18:14] thee because he trusteth in thee."
[1:18:17] It's a powerful word word of the Lord.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. In the Hebrew, the word phrase
[1:18:22] perfect peace, it actually means shalom.
[1:18:25] Shalom.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; They put it in there as perfect peace.
[1:18:28] But it's actually repeated twice.
[1:18:31] Shalom. Shalom. Amen. I trust in the
[1:18:34] Lord. And what does he give me? He gives
[1:18:36] us perfect peace. Whose mind is stayed
[1:18:39] upon thee because he trustth in thee.
[1:18:42] That's a place to trust in the Almighty.
[1:18:45] Amen. Not a fragile calmness or a hope
[1:18:48] so, but a deep completeness in Almighty
[1:18:51] God. Amen. Where you know that you stand
[1:18:55] in the presence of God and that you have
[1:18:58] favor with Almighty God.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; You say, "How do I know I have favor,
[1:19:01] Brother Kelly?" Amen. Just follow his
[1:19:04] word.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Day by day, follow his word. If
[1:19:08] something transpired, I'm so thankful
[1:19:10] for the blood of Jesus Christ. Amen. If
[1:19:12] there's a ill thought or some thought
[1:19:14] comes into our mind. Amen. We can plead
[1:19:17] on the blood and say, "Lord, forgive me
[1:19:19] that thought." Amen. And God immediately
[1:19:22] erases it off your record. Amen. Come
[1:19:24] on, church. Amen. God has provided
[1:19:27] everything we have needed for this
[1:19:29] journey. Amen. There's no need for us to
[1:19:31] be uncom. There's no need for us to be
[1:19:34] stressed out wondering about outcomes.
[1:19:36] AMEN. LET'S PUT IT IN THE HANDS OF JESUS
[1:19:39] CHRIST THIS MORNING HOUR. AMEN. I MAY
[1:19:42] NOT KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH, BUT
[1:19:43] HE KNOWS WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH
[1:19:45] TODAY. AMEN. I SAY THIS MORNING, PUT IT
[1:19:48] IN THE HANDS OF CHRIST. AMEN. HE'LL TAKE
[1:19:50] CARE OF OF life's journey for you. Amen.
[1:19:54] Don't take it away from him, but put it
[1:19:56] in his hands. Amen. We serve a
[1:19:58] supernatural God. Amen. We serve a God
[1:20:02] who wants to fortify our minds and our
[1:20:04] hearts unto him. I believe that's
[1:20:07] transpiring. I don't believe that the
[1:20:09] bride of Jesus Christ is just going to
[1:20:10] go in on a hope so or a maybe so. We're
[1:20:14] going in with flying colors in this
[1:20:15] generation. Amen. IT'S NOT GOING TO BE
[1:20:18] BY THE SKIN OF OUR TEETH OR BY BY THE
[1:20:20] SEAT OF OUR PANTS, BUT WE'RE GOING IN AS
[1:20:22] A VICTORIOUS armor of ARMY OF ALMIGHTY
[1:20:25] GOD. AMEN. WATCHING WALKING IN STEP WITH
[1:20:28] A MASTER IN THIS HOUR. AMEN. CHRIST
[1:20:30] GOING BEFORE US. AMEN. AND WE'RE GOING
[1:20:33] TO STAND WITH THE DEVIL UNDERNEATH OUR
[1:20:35] FEET IN THIS HOUR. AND NO DEMON POWER IS
[1:20:38] GOING TO SHAKE US FROM IT. Maybe give me
[1:20:40] a little more monitor if you could.
[1:20:43] Amen. Satan should be completely
[1:20:45] helpless.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; Completely helpless.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE'S TRYING TO DISRUPT YOUR WORLD.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BUT IT'S TIME WE REALIZE OUR
[1:20:57] POSITION. LET'S SAY MY POSITION.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; THAT I'M A SON OF GOD. I'M A DAUGHTER OF
[1:21:01] GOD. I'VE GOT A POSITION IN CHRIST.
[1:21:04] AMEN. HE'S GIVEN ME THE AUTHORITY IN
[1:21:06] THIS HOUR. AMEN. WE'RE NO DEVIL IN HELL.
[1:21:09] WE SHOULD BE TEARING DOWN SATAN'S
[1:21:11] KINGDOM, NOT ALLOWING HIM TO BUILD UP
[1:21:13] HIS KINGDOM. I SAY, CHURCH OF THE LIVING
[1:21:16] GOD. TEAR DOWN ALL THE GATES OF HELL.
[1:21:19] AMEN. AND LET CHRIST GIVE YOU CALM IN
[1:21:21] YOUR HEART. AMEN. LET HIM BE YOUR STRESS
[1:21:23] RELIEVER. AMEN. We need to WE NEED TO
[1:21:27] REALIZE WHO WE ARE IN CHRIST JESUS.
[1:21:30] We're the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; We're his bride.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. He doesn't want us to stand as a
[1:21:40] defeated people.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. He He HE WON THE VICTORY ON
[1:21:44] CALVARY. AMEN. The very SAME SPIRIT THAT
[1:21:47] RESIDED IN JESUS CHRIST HAS POURED INTO
[1:21:50] THE church of the living God. AMEN. IT'S
[1:21:52] LIVING IN YOUR HEART. IT'S LIVING IN
[1:21:54] YOUR SOUL. AMEN. DON'T LET THE DEVIL
[1:21:57] MOVE ON THE SCENE AND TRY TO DISTRACT
[1:21:59] YOU IN THIS LATE HOUR. I SAY THIS
[1:22:02] MORNING HOUR, IT'S GOING HOME TIME THIS
[1:22:04] MORNING HOUR. AMEN. ONE DAY WE'RE GOING
[1:22:06] TO TAKE A STEP, AMEN, FROM THIS LIFE
[1:22:09] INTO IMMORTAL LIFE. AMEN. AND WE'LL STEP
[1:22:12] RIGHT INTO OUR THEOPHONY INTO OUR
[1:22:14] GLORIFIED BODY. AMEN. DON'T LET THE
[1:22:17] DEVIL DISTRACT YOU IN THE HOUR WE'RE
[1:22:19] LIVING IN. AMEN. Take it serious what
[1:22:22] God is doing.
[1:22:25] Sometimes you wonder if people really
[1:22:27] take it serious.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. We serve a great God.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; Jesus never promised life without
[1:22:36] stress,
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; but he gave you the tools.
[1:22:40] He gave you his word.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; He promised you peace in the midst of
[1:22:45] stress.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; We know the stories very well in the
[1:22:48] Bible when when the disciples in St.
[1:22:50] Mark chapter 4 when the disciples were
[1:22:53] panicking in the storm. They're in the
[1:22:55] middle of a storm. Amen. Jesus has just
[1:22:58] preached a campaign and he's tired and
[1:23:00] he's in the front of the boat and the
[1:23:02] devil trying to take an advantage.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the way the devil works it.
[1:23:08] He works it sometimes Sunday afternoon,
[1:23:10] Monday morning, he takes advantage. I
[1:23:13] sometimes I don't know about y'all, but
[1:23:14] sometimes you're singing I'm one of
[1:23:16] them. I'm one of them. and you get a
[1:23:17] phone call and that phone call just
[1:23:20] disrupts your day
[1:23:23] and you get all stressed out of it and
[1:23:24] all a sudden you forget the words, "I'm
[1:23:26] one of them." That's where we need to
[1:23:28] keep on saying it. I'm one of them.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm one of them. Amen. It was a
[1:23:32] bad phone call. It was a bad doctor
[1:23:34] report. But I'm still one of them.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's been with ME THROUGH EVERY
[1:23:39] TRIAL. HE'S BEEN WITH ME THROUGH EVERY
[1:23:40] DIFFICULTY. AMEN. Christ has never for
[1:23:43] NEVER FORSOOK ME. AMEN. SO WE CAN BE ONE
[1:23:46] OF THEM WHETHER WE'RE ON THE TOP OF THE
[1:23:48] MOUNTAIN OR IN THE VALLEY BELOW. AMEN.
[1:23:51] SOMEBODY SAY, "PRAISE THE LORD THIS
[1:23:52] morning hour." Amen. We're living in an
[1:23:55] incredible time, church.
[1:23:58] Amen. We may go home this year. Amen. I
[1:24:01] trust that it'll be that way.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. I trust that the rapture will
[1:24:05] come. Amen. We'll walk right out of this
[1:24:08] world. But they were panicking in the
[1:24:10] midst of the ocean. They saying they
[1:24:12] were saying shouting to Jesus, "MASTER,
[1:24:15] MASTER, MASTER, CARE US NOW." NOT THAT
[1:24:17] WE PERISH.
[1:24:19] But Jesus wasn't worried about it.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; He was sleeping on the front of the
[1:24:24] boat, no doubt, on a pillow. And and
[1:24:27] just sleeping there calmly and and the
[1:24:29] same storm that was terrifying THE
[1:24:31] DISCIPLES HAD NO EFFECT.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; Let's say no effect.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; It had no effect on Jesus.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Satan can't sink a ship when
[1:24:41] Christ is inside of it. SATAN CAN'T
[1:24:44] DESTROY YOU WHEN CHRIST IS INSIDE. But
[1:24:47] if HE CAN GET YOU TO DISBELIEVE THAT FOR
[1:24:50] ONE moment he got you licked.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; What did Jesus do? He arose and said,
[1:24:57] "Peace be still." The waves obeyed him
[1:25:01] because peace himself spoke.
[1:25:05] Amen. I love that one place where the
[1:25:08] Bible says that the storm stilled and
[1:25:10] they immediately were at the other side.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? Christ is in control.
[1:25:16] Amen. I say let there be perfect peace
[1:25:19] in our lives. Though the billows may
[1:25:21] dash and the world may be in turmoil,
[1:25:24] but as a Christian, we rest in perfect
[1:25:26] assurance knowing that God is in control
[1:25:30] of our life.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes we think peace means no
[1:25:34] burdens.
[1:25:36] But true peace can coexist with a heavy
[1:25:38] load.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; When that load is shared with Christ, we
[1:25:42] know the scripture says, "Come unto me
[1:25:44] all ye that labor and heavy laden. I'll
[1:25:46] give you rest. My yoke is easy. My
[1:25:48] burdens are light." Peace is not the
[1:25:50] removal of responsibility. It's really
[1:25:52] the revelation that you're yolked
[1:25:54] together with Christ.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. I looked that up and and and they
[1:25:58] say that a team of ox when they're
[1:26:01] underneath one yolk, they sometimes will
[1:26:04] put an old ox together with one that's
[1:26:06] learning. And what happens is is the
[1:26:09] older ox is the one that's pulling the
[1:26:11] load. But the younger ox is learning to
[1:26:13] walk in step with the older one.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. When we when we're yolked
[1:26:18] together, when you're yolked together
[1:26:19] with Christ, Amen. You may be stressed
[1:26:21] out, but when you walk in step with the
[1:26:23] Prince of Peace himself, Amen. It gives
[1:26:26] you gives you the fortitude of how to
[1:26:28] walk in times of stress.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. God is teaching us. Amen. How to
[1:26:34] walk in the world that we're living in.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I I say that world stress. You
[1:26:40] say, "Will you ever get stressed out
[1:26:41] again?" Brother Kelly, I probably get
[1:26:42] stressed out every day, but I take it to
[1:26:45] the Lord in prayer. Amen. Stress tries
[1:26:48] to pull me one way, but you can use
[1:26:50] stress as rocket fuel and as prayer
[1:26:52] fuel. Amen. Because you can bring it
[1:26:55] down on the devil himself. Amen. He
[1:26:58] might tell you you're not worth it.
[1:27:00] You're never going to make it. You're
[1:27:02] then he'll tell you all kinds of THINGS
[1:27:03] IN YOUR EAR, BUT YOU turn around and
[1:27:05] say, "Sorry, DEVIL. IT'S TOO LATE for
[1:27:07] all of THAT RIGHT NOW. I AM GOING TO
[1:27:09] MAKE IT. I AM A CHILD OF GOD. YOU ARE MY
[1:27:13] HEALER. YOU'RE MY ALL AND ALL."
[1:27:16] HALLELUJAH.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; Use it for fuel.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; Burn it up.
[1:27:27] The word keep means to guard. It's a
[1:27:30] garrison. It's like a soul like a
[1:27:32] soldiers around a fortress. When Satan
[1:27:34] when stress attacks your mind, peace
[1:27:37] stands guard at the gate.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Stress says what if it doesn't
[1:27:42] work out?
[1:27:44] But peace says that God has already gone
[1:27:47] before me.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Peace. Stress says you're not
[1:27:51] adequate.
[1:27:53] Maybe the devil's never told you that.
[1:27:55] But he told me that a lot of times.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; But peace said Christ in me is more than
[1:28:00] enough.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Stress says this is too much. I
[1:28:04] can't bear another load of it. But the
[1:28:07] Bible says he'll always make a way of
[1:28:09] escape for you.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Peace says, "My grace is
[1:28:12] sufficient for you."
[1:28:15] Amen. He's got it in control.
[1:28:18] Amen. Peace is something that that grows
[1:28:20] in the soil of surrender. You cannot
[1:28:23] produce it by efforts. It's born by
[1:28:25] abiding in Christ. The more you
[1:28:28] struggle, the less peace you feel. Amen.
[1:28:31] The more you surrender, the more peace
[1:28:33] grows.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Do you believe that this
[1:28:36] morning?
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Colossians 3:15 says, "Let the
[1:28:40] peace of God," let's say, "Peace of God
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; rule in your hearts." Amen. In other
[1:28:46] words, let him rule on your throne.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not your emotions.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Our emotions will take us many
[1:28:53] places. You get wrong news. You get
[1:28:56] fears. Amen. But when peace is the
[1:28:58] umpire of your soul, it brings a
[1:29:00] different stage of life for you. Amen.
[1:29:03] Bible examples we can look at is Daniel
[1:29:05] in the lion's den. stress all around
[1:29:08] him, but peace was in his heart. Amen.
[1:29:11] Because the presence of God was with him
[1:29:14] in the lion's den.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:29:18] Paul, Paul and Silas, they were in
[1:29:20] prison. They were beaten and they were
[1:29:21] chained. Yet, they sang hymns at
[1:29:24] midnight. Amen. Peace turned their
[1:29:26] prison into a sanctuary. What would
[1:29:29] happen if THAT WOULD TRANSPIRE HERE this
[1:29:31] morning hour? Amen. When peace becomes
[1:29:34] YOUR SANCTUARY. AMEN. I SAY AGAIN THIS
[1:29:36] MORNING, THE DEVIL DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHEN PEACE IS RULING IN YOUR
[1:29:41] HEART, YOU'VE GOT NOTHING TO FEAR. AMEN.
[1:29:44] CHRIST IS WITH YOU IN THE SHIP.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; Jesus in Gethsemane under extreme
[1:29:50] pressure, sweating great drops of blood,
[1:29:52] he surrendered, saying, "Not my will,
[1:29:54] but thine be run, thine be done, and
[1:29:56] surrender produced a victory." Amen. It
[1:29:59] gave us the greatest thing we could ever
[1:30:01] get receive. It gave us salvation.
[1:30:04] Amen. Aren't you grateful for it?
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not what you have done, but
[1:30:08] it's what he's already done.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. THAT'S WHY HE SAID, "I'VE GIVEN
[1:30:12] YOU MY WORD." YOU DON'T JUST HAVE a have
[1:30:14] a a former age of a ministry IN THIS
[1:30:17] HOUR. YOU'VE GOT THE FINAL. YOU'VE GOT
[1:30:19] THE COMPLETE MINISTRY IN THIS HOUR. THE
[1:30:22] OPEN BOOK, A THIRD PULL MINISTRY. AMEN.
[1:30:24] CHURCH, WE'VE GOT TO BE LIVING ABOVE THE
[1:30:27] THINGS OF THIS WORLD. I'm preaching to
[1:30:29] myself this morning. AMEN. WE'VE GOT TO
[1:30:31] GIVE OUR EVERY CARE UNTO ALMIGHTY GOD.
[1:30:33] AMEN. LET HIM TAKE CONTROL OF OUR LIVES.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; That's his desire.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. When you feel stressed because we
[1:30:43] read this morning in everything by
[1:30:45] prayer with thanksgiving by prayer. What
[1:30:49] transpires when you praise through your
[1:30:51] pressure.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; Hey man, when they were sitting in the
[1:30:54] jail, I studied that many years ago. And
[1:30:57] and here was Paul and here was Silas and
[1:31:00] they're in the middle of the jail. And
[1:31:02] they they what they did in those days,
[1:31:03] they would they would whip their backs
[1:31:05] and they would put their backs onto the
[1:31:07] ground and so that the dirt would get
[1:31:09] into the wounds, it would cause
[1:31:10] infection to cause pain and suffering.
[1:31:13] But in that condition,
[1:31:16] they started to praise.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SOME I I I WON'T SAY this church,
[1:31:21] maybe I'll say this whatever, but you
[1:31:24] you people know how to praise. I love
[1:31:25] your worship services. I I love the
[1:31:28] entering in of the people. Amen. Because
[1:31:30] when you praise, Amen, through the
[1:31:32] pressures of life, your worship shifts
[1:31:35] the focus FROM YOUR STORM TO your
[1:31:37] savior. Amen. When you praise through
[1:31:40] the middle of the storm, AMEN. WHEN YOU
[1:31:42] PRAISE WHEN THINGS ARE DOWN, AMEN. WHEN
[1:31:45] YOU GIVE A SACRIFICE OF PRAISE, AMEN.
[1:31:47] AND SAY, "LORD, I DON'T FEEL LIKE IT
[1:31:49] THIS MORNING HOUR." AMEN. BUT I'M GOING
[1:31:51] TO PRAISE THE NAME OF THE LORD THIS
[1:31:53] MORNING. AMEN. REGARDLESS OF HOW I FEEL.
[1:31:59] HALLELUJAH.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; We don't praise him enough.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; We don't thank him enough.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. We should praise him every day,
[1:32:10] every moment of the day.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord, to be able to focus upon
[1:32:16] his word.
[1:32:17] Amen. When we praise him through our
[1:32:19] storm, it brings victory. Amen. We're to
[1:32:22] keep our mind stayed in the word. Amen.
[1:32:25] We got to keep our thoughts stabilized
[1:32:27] by the word. We have to have a thankful
[1:32:29] heart. Amen. Thankfulness disarms
[1:32:32] anxiety.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. When you're thankful, all your
[1:32:36] anxiety goes away. Hey, I come home.
[1:32:39] Sister Mart, how are you doing? I'm
[1:32:41] doing great.
[1:32:43] Amen. I say that all the time because I
[1:32:45] believe with all my heart. We were at a
[1:32:48] meeting and brother Calvin was there and
[1:32:49] he was speaking to the young people and
[1:32:51] here we had the same lines we used every
[1:32:53] day. We didn't even know it. He said,"
[1:32:55] he said, "I feel great every day."
[1:32:56] People made me feel so great. I just
[1:32:58] feel great. Amen. I know Christ is with
[1:33:01] me.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's keeping me in in the in the
[1:33:06] line
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; line of duty. Guard your mind.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; Don't fe Don't feed stress with
[1:33:15] overthinking.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; Feed peace with meditation on the word
[1:33:18] of God.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Guard your heart.
[1:33:23] You're never going to find peace in
[1:33:25] computer games.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; You'll find peace in the message of the
[1:33:30] hour.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; Computer games will stress you out.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; I'm going home in a day, so
[1:33:44] you'll have the regulars back on next
[1:33:46] week.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; It's the truth.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're never going to keep a home
[1:33:54] in order if one or the other is playing
[1:33:56] computer games all day long.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; No communication.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; You know what you have? You have a
[1:34:05] stressed out home.
[1:34:08] Everybody's stressed out.
[1:34:12] He's trying to get to another level.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; In the meantime, the kids are tearing it
[1:34:18] up.
[1:34:20] The wife is stressed out.
[1:34:23] Ask for free.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; Nobody gave me a pink note on the way
[1:34:27] in.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; We live in a in the lady of seeing age.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; It's full of confusion, fear, and
[1:34:37] instability.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; But God's bride is called to manifest
[1:34:42] calm assurance.
[1:34:44] We sing the song, "Mine, mine, mine.
[1:34:46] Jesus is mine. Mine when I'm weary, mine
[1:34:50] when I'm dreary.
[1:34:51] Amen. Is he yours all the moment of the
[1:34:53] day?
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:57] Is the peace of God ruling in your heart
[1:35:01] and miss all the confusion of the world?
[1:35:04] I trust it is. If it isn't this morning,
[1:35:07] I would recommend that you would ask the
[1:35:09] peace of God to come into your heart.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you need to lay anything down,
[1:35:14] this age is stressed.
[1:35:16] Nations
[1:35:18] are breaking. Economies are crumbling.
[1:35:21] Churches are stressed out. But somehow
[1:35:24] the bride walks in perfect harmony with
[1:35:27] the King of Kings.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. The revealed word of God that
[1:35:32] cannot fail in the hour we're living in.
[1:35:35] Amen. The bride knows who she is and who
[1:35:37] she belongs to.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; You may walk through a season where the
[1:35:41] load is heavy, but you're not walking
[1:35:42] alone.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. The same Christ who said peace be
[1:35:48] still to the sea can whisper the same to
[1:35:50] your heart. I say this morning hour let
[1:35:53] peace be your position.
[1:35:55] Let calmness be your confession.
[1:35:58] Amen. You may be stressed out but I say
[1:36:01] this morning give it to Jesus.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; In Romans 15:13 it says, "Now the God of
[1:36:06] hope fill you with all joy and peace in
[1:36:09] believing that you may abound in hope
[1:36:10] through the power of the Holy Ghost."
[1:36:13] Right.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; In third Exodus, brother Bram says,
[1:36:15] "Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by
[1:36:17] the word." Tell me that one man can
[1:36:20] speak anything contrary to that and say
[1:36:22] it's the word of God when heavens and
[1:36:23] earth will pass away, but that word
[1:36:26] shall not. Faith finds the word
[1:36:29] sanctuary of rest.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. It moves right up on top that
[1:36:35] eternal rock, Christ Jesus, the word,
[1:36:37] and lays down there and rests. Let the
[1:36:39] winds howl. Let the storms shake. She is
[1:36:42] safe evermore. She rests right there on
[1:36:44] that word. That's where faith, genuine
[1:36:49] Christian faith
[1:36:51] rests. Resting place is the word. For it
[1:36:54] knows that God will ever prove himself
[1:36:56] superior over everyone. Let's say
[1:36:59] everyone.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; Every one of his enemies.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you believe that? Amen.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; I say if you need to cast down in Jesus
[1:37:09] name every imagination, pull down every
[1:37:11] lie of the devil.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. It doesn't matter. Somebody said
[1:37:16] this or somebody says that. I
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; It doesn't really matter. You say,
[1:37:19] "Well, I can't serve God because of so
[1:37:21] and so." No, you got to get Christ in
[1:37:23] your heart because it's not between you
[1:37:24] and so and so.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; It's between you and Jesus Christ
[1:37:28] personally.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Allow Christ to come in your heart
[1:37:32] to the fullest extent.
[1:37:34] Amen. Walk in peace. Walk in power. Walk
[1:37:38] in perfect clarity of the message of the
[1:37:40] hour. Amen. Last scripture I want to
[1:37:43] leave with you is second Timothy 1:7.
[1:37:46] For God hath not given us a spirit of
[1:37:48] fear, but of power. Let's say power
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; and of love and a sound mind. It's going
[1:37:55] to be this year for sister, myself, and
[1:37:57] our daughter Melody that our son-in-law
[1:37:59] My passed away 12 years ago coming up
[1:38:01] here just in a couple of days. It was an
[1:38:03] incredible time of stress and it was a
[1:38:05] credible time where we had to learn to
[1:38:08] lean on Jesus Christ. Amen. But God
[1:38:11] through it all kept us in the way. Amen.
[1:38:14] It doesn't matter what the circumstances
[1:38:16] or what it is. This scripture kept our
[1:38:18] heart and our minds fixed on God. We did
[1:38:21] not look at our circumstance. We did not
[1:38:23] I know what I'm preaching this morning.
[1:38:25] We did not look at our circumstances. We
[1:38:27] did not look on woe is me and and and
[1:38:29] too bad for me. You know, we looked at
[1:38:31] the word of God that God has a perfect
[1:38:33] plan.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. And his perfect plan should bring
[1:38:36] peace to the heart of a believing
[1:38:38] person. Amen. Especially to a bride
[1:38:41] member. Amen. Of the message of the
[1:38:43] hour. Amen. We we say all the time, God
[1:38:46] is in control. And if he's in control,
[1:38:48] let him be in control.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. And let the peace of God fill you
[1:38:53] with all of his joy in serving him.
[1:38:56] Amen. because it's an honor and it's a
[1:38:58] joy to serve the living God.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't know if we know know this
[1:39:03] song. Uh it's a song that that that we
[1:39:05] sing at home sometimes and maybe brother
[1:39:07] Andrew can help me sing it. Going up
[1:39:09] yonder. Do you know that song? Could we
[1:39:12] sing that song this morning? It looks
[1:39:13] like you all know the song real well. I
[1:39:16] can't sing it. I I know I know brother
[1:39:18] Andrew is saying he's going to have his
[1:39:20] turn to sing up up when we get to the
[1:39:22] other side. I'm going to have my turn my
[1:39:23] turn too. Amen. But I don't know how
[1:39:25] it's going to going to sound like, but
[1:39:27] I'm not going to worry about it when I'm
[1:39:28] up there. Amen. I'm going to say, "Lord,
[1:39:30] give me some of the ability of some of
[1:39:32] these singing people." Amen. But why
[1:39:34] don't we sing that together this morning
[1:39:36] going up yonder. Amen. Let the peace of
[1:39:39] God rule in your heart. Let stress don't
[1:39:42] don't be stressed out. You find stress
[1:39:43] coming on you, take it in control
[1:39:45] immediately. Amen. Garnish it. Take it
[1:39:48] like a prisoner and take it and cast it
[1:39:51] down. and say, "I'm not going to let
[1:39:52] stress rule my life today."
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. But I'm going to let Jesus Christ,
[1:39:57] the word of God, rule rule in my heart.
[1:40:00] You love the Lord this morning. Give him
[1:40:02] a good hand clap and praise this
[1:40:03] morning. We love you with all of our
[1:40:05] heart, with all of our mind, all of our
[1:40:07] soul. Amen.
[1:40:10] God bless you. Bless you. Thank you. God
[1:40:14] bless you.
[1:40:16] If you want to know
[1:40:21] where I'm going,
[1:40:25] where I'm going,
[1:40:28] oh, one day soon.
[1:40:33] Oh, if anybody ask you
[1:40:39] where I'm going
[1:40:43] where I'm going
[1:40:46] for one day soon.
[1:40:49] Just tell them for me I'm going up
[1:40:53] yonder.
[1:40:56] I'm going up yonder.
[1:40:59] Oh, I'm going up yonder
[1:41:04] to be with my Lord.
[1:41:08] Oh, I'm going in rapture.
[1:41:14] I'm going in rapture.
[1:41:17] Oh, I'm going in rapture.
[1:41:21] Going to be with my Lord.
[1:41:25] Oh,
[1:41:27] I can take the pain,
[1:41:31] the heartache that life brings,
[1:41:36] the comfort in knowing,
[1:41:39] I'll soon be gone.
[1:41:44] Oh, as God gives me grace,
[1:41:49] I'll run this Christian race
[1:41:53] until I see my Savior.
[1:41:57] I see him face to face.
[1:42:00] Oh,
[1:42:02] I'm going up yonder.
[1:42:07] I'm going up yonder.
[1:42:11] I'm going up yonder.
[1:42:15] Be with my Lord.
[1:42:20] I'm going in the rapture.
[1:42:24] I'm going in the rapture.
[1:42:29] I'm going in the rapture
[1:42:32] to be with my Lord.
[1:42:36] Oh, I can take the pain.
[1:42:41] Oh, the heartache that life brings.
[1:42:46] The comfort in knowing
[1:42:49] I'll soon be gone.
[1:42:55] As God gives me grace,
[1:43:02] I'm going to see him.
[1:43:07] I see you face to face. I'm resting on
[1:43:10] that. Oh, I'm going up yonder.
[1:43:17] I'm going up yonder.
[1:43:22] I'm going up yonder
[1:43:25] to be with my Lord.
[1:43:32] You are God alone
[1:43:35] from before time began.
[1:43:40] You are on your throne.
[1:43:44] And you are God alone. And right now
[1:43:49] and right now
[1:43:52] in the good times and bad.
[1:43:57] You were on your throne
[1:44:01] and you are God alone.
[1:44:09] You're the only God whose power
[1:44:14] none can contain.
[1:44:18] You're the only God whose name
[1:44:23] is praise and remembering.
[1:44:26] You're the only God who's worthy
[1:44:32] of everything we can give.
[1:44:35] You are God
[1:44:38] and that's just the way it is.
[1:44:42] For you are God alone
[1:44:46] from before time began.
[1:44:51] Oh, you were on your throne
[1:44:56] and you are God alone.
[1:45:01] And right now
[1:45:04] in the good times and bad
[1:45:09] you were on your throne
[1:45:13] and you are God alone.
[1:45:18] You're unchangeable,
[1:45:23] unshakeable,
[1:45:28] unstoppable.
[1:45:30] Oh, that's what you are. You're
[1:45:34] unchangeable.
[1:45:36] You're unchangeable,
[1:45:40] unshakeable.
[1:45:44] You're unstoppable.
[1:45:47] Oh, that's what you are.
[1:45:52] For you are God alone.
[1:45:56] From before time began
[1:46:00] for you were on your throne.
[1:46:05] You are God alone.
[1:46:10] Right now
[1:46:13] in the good times and
[1:46:18] you were on your throne
[1:46:21] and you are God alone.
[1:46:27] How many could say that Jesus spoke to
[1:46:29] you today?
[1:46:31] Amen.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; How many could say Jesus spoke to him
[1:46:34] today
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; in these words?
[1:46:38] Walking in peace in a stressful world.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; I know it might be just a little bit
[1:46:46] crowded, but if you'd like to come up
[1:46:47] for prayer this morning, cuz I know
[1:46:51] I know how special this service is this
[1:46:53] morning, and I don't want you to miss
[1:46:55] your moment, cuz Jesus ain't stressed
[1:46:58] out by the storm.
[1:47:00] Amen.
[1:47:07] Oh, crossing the calm scenes of Jesus,
[1:47:12] the disciples were getting concerned.
[1:47:18] The wind started violently blowing,
[1:47:23] but he was asleep in the storm.
[1:47:30] Does he not care that we perish?
[1:47:34] We are helpless and we're so afraid.
[1:47:41] Jesus arose when they call him.
[1:47:46] Said to them, "Where is your faith?"
[1:47:51] Because you pray
[1:47:54] all night
[1:47:56] cuz you held on with all your might. Oh
[1:48:01] child, your cries
[1:48:05] have woken
[1:48:08] the master.
[1:48:12] Oh, he knows
[1:48:16] your voice.
[1:48:18] Lift your hands. It's time to rejoice.
[1:48:23] Oh child, your cries
[1:48:27] have opened
[1:48:30] the master.
[1:48:34] Where will it hit you without any
[1:48:38] warning?
[1:48:41] Oh, the storm of your life have begun.
[1:48:47] will see no hope in the distance.
[1:48:52] Oh, you're frightened and nowhere to
[1:48:55] run.
[1:48:57] By now your vessel is feeling
[1:49:03] and you're thinking you're surely
[1:49:07] bound.
[1:49:09] You cried out for help from the Savior.
[1:49:15] No, you can't give up now
[1:49:19] cuz you pray
[1:49:23] all night
[1:49:25] cuz you held on with all of your might.
[1:49:30] But now your cross
[1:49:34] have opened
[1:49:37] the master.
[1:49:41] Holy Ghost
[1:49:45] your voice.
[1:49:48] Lift your hands. It's time to rejoice.
[1:49:52] Oh child, your cry
[1:49:57] have woken
[1:50:00] the master. Because you prayed all
[1:50:02] night.
[1:50:04] Because you prayed
[1:50:08] all night.
[1:50:10] Cuz you held on with all of your might.
[1:50:15] Child your cry
[1:50:19] and open
[1:50:22] the master.
[1:50:27] Holy know
[1:50:30] your voice.
[1:50:33] Lift your hands. It's time to rejoice.
[1:50:38] child. Your cry
[1:50:41] has woken
[1:50:45] the master.
[1:50:48] Turn
[1:50:50] your eyes
[1:50:53] on Jesus.
[1:51:00] Look for
[1:51:03] in his wonderful
[1:51:06] face.
[1:51:12] And the things
[1:51:15] of this world.
[1:51:24] Oh, in the light
[1:51:31] and grace. Just turn your eyes.
[1:51:36] Oh, turn.
[1:51:40] Turn your eyes
[1:51:42] on Jesus.
[1:51:50] Look for
[1:51:52] in his wonderful
[1:51:56] face.
[1:52:02] And the things
[1:52:05] of this world
[1:52:08] will grow strange.
[1:52:14] Oh, in the light
[1:52:18] of his glory
[1:52:20] and grace,
[1:52:27] you are awesome in this place.
[1:52:31] Mighty God,
[1:52:36] you are awesome in this place.

[1:53:00] God.
[1:53:03] And you are awesome in this place,
[1:53:08] mighty God.
[1:53:12] And you are awesome in this place.
[1:53:17] Father,
[1:53:21] you are worthy of our praise.
[1:53:26] To you our lives we raise.
[1:53:30] You are awesome in this place, mighty
[1:53:35] God.
[1:53:42] Healing is here.
[1:53:48] Oh,
[1:53:50] healing is here.
[1:53:57] Oh,
[1:53:58] he
[1:54:00] is here.
[1:54:05] Oh, and I see it.
[1:54:14] Oh,
[1:54:16] he
[1:54:17] is here.
[1:54:23] Oh,
[1:54:25] healing
[1:54:26] is here.
[1:54:34] Oh, he is here.
[1:54:42] Oh, and I believe
[1:54:46] it.
[1:54:50] Oh, I reach my hands
[1:54:56] oh to the heavens.
[1:55:01] I lift my eyes
[1:55:04] where my help comes from.
[1:55:10] I look to you,
[1:55:13] oh my rock,
[1:55:16] my healer.
[1:55:19] I trust in you.
[1:55:23] Freedom is.
[1:55:26] Oh,
[1:55:28] freom
[1:55:29] is here.
[1:55:35] Oh yes, freom
[1:55:38] is here.
[1:55:44] Oh, freom
[1:55:47] is here.
[1:55:53] Oh, and I receive
[1:55:58] it.
[1:56:02] Oh yes, freom
[1:56:05] is here.
[1:56:11] Oh, freom
[1:56:15] is here.
[1:56:21] Oh yes, freom
[1:56:24] is here.
[1:56:30] Oh, and I receive it off my hands.
[1:56:39] Oh, I lift my hands
[1:56:45] onto the heavens.
[1:56:53] where my help comes from.
[1:56:58] I look to you
[1:57:02] my rock
[1:57:04] my healer
[1:57:08] to steal you.
[1:57:12] Say Jesus
[1:57:14] Jesus is here. Oh Jesus is here.
[1:57:24] Oh Jesus
[1:57:27] is here.
[1:57:33] Oh
[1:57:35] Jesus

[2:32:15] out. Well, I'll never let a mountain or
[2:32:20] shout in my place. Well, there ain't a
[2:32:24] rock or an angel that can sing amazing
[2:32:27] praise. Praise the Lord everybody.
[2:32:32] Oh, praise the Lord. Praise the Lord
[2:32:36] everybody.
[2:32:37] Oh, praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[2:32:43] Oh, praise the Lord.
[2:32:49] Oh, praise the Lord. Will you wonder why
[2:32:54] I'm happy and why I leap and shout? Will
[2:32:59] I begin in on the message pouring out? I
[2:33:04] got rid of my tradition. I laid aside
[2:33:08] all my doubt. I got closer to the Lord
[2:33:13] where his glories come now. Praise the
[2:33:16] Lord.
[2:33:19] Oh, praise the Lord. Praise the Lord,
[2:33:24] everybody.
[2:33:26] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[2:33:31] Oh, praise the Lord.
[2:33:37] Aren't you one more time? Let's say,
[2:33:40] "Praise the Lord."
[2:33:43] Oh, praise the Lord.
[2:33:48] Everybody
[2:33:50] praise
[2:33:51] the Lord.
[2:33:55] Hallelujah.
[2:33:58] Hallelujah.
[2:34:00] Hallelujah.
[2:34:02] ARE YOU STRESS FREE IN JESUS THIS
[2:34:04] MORNING?
[2:34:06] HALLELUJAH.
[2:34:09] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:34:12] I said hallelujah.
[2:34:16] &gt;&gt; I don't know what you're going to say,
[2:34:17] but I'm going to say hallelujah.
[2:34:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:34:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:34:22] &gt;&gt; Now, try to put fear in the mouth of
[2:34:25] faith.
[2:34:26] &gt;&gt; You can't say the same at the same time.
[2:34:29] &gt;&gt; You can't say wowsy wy woo and
[2:34:31] hallelujah at the same time.
[2:34:34] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. You cannot be peace
[2:34:36] in peace and stressed out at the same
[2:34:38] time. I choose to live in peace.
[2:34:42] &gt;&gt; I am too blessed TO BE STRESSED. I AM AN
[2:34:45] OVERCOMER by the blood of THE LAMB. SO I
[2:34:48] SAY HALLELUJAH.
[2:34:49] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:34:50] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:34:51] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:34:52] &gt;&gt; Blue Jim, how you doing?
[2:35:01] &gt;&gt; I can know good and well there some days
[2:35:04] when he sure don't feel like he's great
[2:35:07] and getting better. I'd say while he's
[2:35:09] plumbing sometimes and the plumbing just
[2:35:11] ain't working exactly like it's supposed
[2:35:13] to be because he's working on an old
[2:35:15] house. I'd say there's some moments he's
[2:35:18] thinking this ain't great and it ain't
[2:35:19] getting any better.
[2:35:21] But you could call him up
[2:35:23] &gt;&gt; in a matter of a moment say, "Brother
[2:35:25] Jim, how you doing?"
[2:35:29] &gt;&gt; Well, church,
[2:35:31] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[2:35:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:35:33] &gt;&gt; It's another miracle making morning.
[2:35:41] WALKING IN peace in a stressful world.
[2:35:46] That's me.
[2:35:48] &gt;&gt; I don't know if anybody else came to
[2:35:50] church to get preached to today, but I
[2:35:52] sure did.
[2:35:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I can say it's good.
[2:35:57] &gt;&gt; My goodness.
[2:35:58] &gt;&gt; Now, how many just like to give Brother
[2:36:00] Kelly and Sister Meer a great big hand?
[2:36:03] God bless you. God bless you, sis.
[2:36:06] God bless you, brother Kelly. We love
[2:36:09] you with all our heart. You mean the
[2:36:11] world to us. Our brothers, our brother's
[2:36:14] back there at the back and wants to
[2:36:15] shake every one of your hands. God bless
[2:36:17] you as you go out.
[2:36:20] Don't give him your heart. Don't give
[2:36:21] him your life story. Just say, "God
[2:36:23] bless you and hallelujah."
[2:36:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't you love the Lord?
[2:36:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just worship the Lord as
[2:36:30] we're dismissed. I will praise the Lord
[2:36:32] no matter what tomorrow brings. I will
[2:36:35] praise the Lord.
[2:36:37] Kef again says,
[2:36:40] "Oh, I
[2:36:42] will praise
[2:36:44] the Lord."
[2:36:48] Oh, I
[2:36:51] will praise
[2:36:53] the Lord.
[2:36:57] Oh no matter what tomorrow brings,
[2:37:03] what it has in store,
[2:37:07] I
[2:37:09] will praise
[2:37:11] the Lord.
