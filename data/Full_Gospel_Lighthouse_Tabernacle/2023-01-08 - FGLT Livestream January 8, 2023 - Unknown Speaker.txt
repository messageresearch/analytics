than my pain favor to pay for today amen aren't you glad that he is faithful to us this morning amen so good to be in the house of the Lord at this time I'd like to go ahead and just turn to our scriptures this morning I'd like to read from first Peter verse 1 chapter 1 verse 3. this morning First Peter chapter 1 and verse 3. and it says it like this says blessed be the God and Father our Lord Jesus Christ which according to His abundant Mercy hath begotten us unto the Lively Hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead and to an inheritance Incorruptible undefiled that faith is not a way reserved in heaven for you aren't you glad for that this morning amen who are kept by the power of God aren't you glad you're kept this morning through the faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time we're in the last time the last age the last day layout of sea and age wherewith ye are greatly rejoiced through now for a season if need be ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations that the trial of your faith and I want you to catch this in verse 7 that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perished though it be tried with a fire might be found unto praise honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ amen let's just Bower heads this morning dear heavenly father Lord we just thank you for letting us be able to gather here once again Lord and open up the pages of this Bible and let the just read this word now Lord we ask you that you'll just let it just come off the pages and into our hearts this morning Lord just just let it just be manifolded to us Lord Lord we love you so much we love reading this word this morning Lord we ask you that you'll just bless us at this time Jesus name amen amen amen you can be seated this morning this morning I'd like to speak to you for a little bit on what we are built for what we're built for so I'd like to just go about it by telling you a dream that I had a couple years ago and in this dream I was speaking and as I was speaking I looked and about in the middle here I seen my teeny which is my my grandma dad's dad's mother she was sitting there and she was in a young body and she was sent in directly beside sister Craighead sister Craighead is the one that's known for writing the song My theophany and both of them in a young body and as I was sitting there looking at both of them I was speaking and I had a lug nut in my hand now I just you just think well what in the world is that but something said you're speaking what you're built for what you're built for now I thought what what a great time that it would become forth even right now that I would hold this until now what we're built for her Sweden being the songwriter of my theothony both of them sitting there in a young body and me speaking on a little lug nut what you're built for now this this is a lug nut if nobody knows what this is in the building here this evening this goes on to your vehicles holds the tires the rims there to the vehicle it's a small thing but it's a great thing the the way it's designed you can't just put any old little nut on it and you might think Matt you're a nut this morning you're right as granddaddy would say I'm screwed on the right Bolt amen so this lug nut is designed for a certain purpose and that purpose is to hold those wheels on a vehicle now it has to be tried it has to meet certain requirements it has to go through several tests and if there's one little just thing that's wrong it has to be placed through another fire it has to be sent back and formed to be perfected again so many times in our lives trials may come along and you go I don't know if I can handle that but God said this is what you're built for this is what I made you for amen so you're made for a purpose in this last day brother Brandon would say it like this said and we're expected to be tested and that's good lesson for my brother back there also he cometh to God must first be tested test it with the word that's God's test do you believe it he cometh to God and must be tested only that only shows a true child then C be tested and when the test comes you can't overcome unless there is tests given to you and when the test is given it's to see whether you can overcome or not and Jesus said to him that overcometh the test the test is the greatest thing that you'll ever happen to you believe it's written in the scripture Peter said that our trials are worth more to us than precious gold your trials are worth more to you than precious gold that's a testing time one good evidence to us that God is with us aren't you glad that he's with you when you're going through a test of Life the trials of life you can look back and say hey that's because God is with me with this he's put me through a test he's testing me in this last day this little lug nut it might not be much but it has to be hardened through it can't just be a surface hardening to where that if the service is broken it's corrupted but it has to be tried completely through that's the way these lug nuts are designed just this piece of metal right here but that's also the way you're designed you have to be tried completely through it can't just be some surface tension that's just there on the outside laying there and then when the Devil comes along puts a little crack in it and you're gone it it's just worthless after that but you're hardened through not hard enough heart to where you can't receive God but you're hardened through to the things of the world Amen we have trials as children children has little trials in the middle of the night they'll get up crying and just screaming and you think oh my Lord what in the Lord so you burp them you feed them you change their diapers diapers but they are going through a trial that they have to go through Charles is teenagers and then we look back at when we was teenagers and we go well that wasn't much of a trial but as a teenager it's a trial to you to get you where you need to be matured in the word amen trials as adults trials is elderly as we get older things come along and you go well I don't understand that didn't happen to me before why has that happening to me now that's a trial that you're going to have to go through to get you where you're going amen and that's recognizing what you've been through that has brought you to this point aren't you glad of that that you can see that that point in your life has brought me to this place at this moment in my life amen we're built for overcoming we're not built to fall at this that or the other anything that would come along like a reed shaking in the wind hey no we're built for this age at this time amen and brother Branham said it like this in Israel in the church and said we started off with Ephesus and ending up in layout I see you the lukewarm Church age where we are now see they have a form of godliness by denying the power thereof going to church having people come and saying just accept Christ just accept Christ put their name on a book but denying the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the power and miracles and the signs and wonders and making fun of it this is brother Brandon saying that in his age and now look at where at today people making fun of the baptism of the Holy Ghost saying that's for a Time past that ain't for you the Miracles ain't for you the Praises the shouting that ain't for you it's for a Time past no that's for me that is for me amen we're in that layout of CN age that lukewarmedness age that God said I'm going to spew you out of my mouth I don't even know you amen that is a trying time Hallelujah and I believe the elect is going to be taken up amen but see when those Trials come it forms you into exactly where you're supposed to fit correctly correctly be in place there now this little thing it can hold a lot of pressure but it can't do it by itself amen if you go to your car this this morning whatever you go out there and you might be able to look at it and you might say well there there's many on there well that's correct amen it's going to take all of us to go in a Rapture it's going to take every single one of you to go it's not just one of us holding on there might be four of them little lug nuts on that thing on one tire but you go to every single one of them and every single one of them is going to have four if you're missing one seek a deacon you need that amen you need that this morning but there are several that's on there little cars is going to have about four and you can't have no less than that because it's not going to work correctly it you see a tire and it's going down the road gets a little wobbly and you're like and you're following that vehicle and you're going oh man and that tire is just shaking like that and you're going well I'm going to pass this guy but I don't know if I should I'll slow down but that thing's just wobbling like that well there's an issue there and and you can see the issue but they might not even know it while they're driving you see some people and they're just going along and they don't even have a clue but that's the way it is even now you see people that's just going and you're going they have an issue but see we can see that and see and what happens is the word of God will come forth and he'll be able to just put that certain person in the right place at the right moment and God can come in with a power tool brother Mark Spencer he works on power tools and those power tools will come down certain pressures got to be presented at that point but you go Lord I don't want that pressure I don't want that in this life I do not want that it hurts so bad but that's what it takes that's what it takes the word of God coming forth amen the speaking of the message it's got to come forth to put you where you need to be in this last day amen he comes along with a torque wrench do you all know what a torque wrench is I'll explain it here a torque wrench applies certain amount of pressure and after it gets to that pressure it breaks it says that's exactly where it needs to be if you put too much pressure on something like that it will snap the metal inside but God knows exactly how much pressure that you're going to take amen God knows what you're going through God sees you and he says just a little bit and that breaker bar just he says he's right now it's perfect now and I believe that's exactly where we're at in this last day God's coming down and he's showing us things that we have never seen before amen we're feeling things we're seeing things Miracles testimonies oh that one's right brother Shannon that's right oh yeah brother Vernon that's right that pressure all he he knew exactly what you could go through to get you to this point in this age amen I'm glad of that this morning I'm glad that the Lord has come forth and said hey that one right there that one's perfectly fitted amen dad says it like this as the Lord spoke to him says see past what you see past what you see what is it you look to that past you look to your present and you look to your future see past what you see here this morning see past what you've been seeing here this morning it's not just a bunch of people just shouting and screaming there's something going on this morning there's something going on in the church there's something going on in the bride amen you were built for this age see past what you see amen look past what you feel amen look past what your trials was in the past see past what you had in the trial but that trial got you to this present and this present see past what you see in this presence in this age in this hour see past what you see to get you to your future amen because what's in our future is what we were built for amen I thank the Lord for that this morning in job 23 and 10 it says but he knoweth the way that I take when he hath tried me I shall come forth as gold aren't you glad of that this morning when he has tried me I have come forth as gold oh what a pureness what a thing that we have men brother Branham would talk about the story of Hattie right and not to like to read some to to you this morning and it says when I was sitting at the table eating dinner and I had been explaining what faith was and sister Hattie Wright was sitting way back out there toward another room and she didn't have much to say never does and then while we were talking I'd say if the Lord showed me a vision and something was to take place then I could say that's it that's what raises my faith I said when the Lord shows me what will take place I have the confidence it's going to be that way when he showed me I said I'd come right here if the little reflected girl sitting there and the Lord had showed me that she was going to be healed I come right here and I'd stand on in track and see everything was just exactly the way he said and I'd then say thus saith the Lord either rise up and walk and I said you see those little legs unfold and the little hands unfold and she'd get up from there and walk up to Gloria to the glory of God I said if it would come to me like that see he was explaining raising their faith a little bit telling exactly how it would be and as it was sitting there and while we were talking I said I want to ask you something what put those squirrels there there's no squirrels in those woods I've been hunting and hunting and I'm not the best hunter but I've hunted since I was a little boy and I'd I'd hunt it's close and they're the most ridiculous Place ridiculous way I could call them I said what put them there and I said I wonder if it's that my Ministry is fixing to take another change that the god of Abraham is confirming his promise as he did to Abraham when he was up on the top of the mount and when he needed a sacrifice for instant of his son instead of his son Jehovah Jireh performed a miracle and the and he placed a ram a hundred miles back and their three days journey and an ordinary man can walk 25 miles a day and lift up his eyes and saw the mountain afar off and then went to the mountain and went up to the top of the mountain while the ram was back there a sheep wild animals would have killed it and then up on the top of that mountain where there's no water see he's explaining where he was at at this moment where Abraham was at how did that realm get there what happened God needed a sacrifice to prove to Abraham that he was Jehovah Jireh the very same God creation spoke that Ram into existence now it wasn't a vision he killed that right that realm the blood came out of that animal it wasn't a vision it was a ram and I said that same God hallelujah Jehovah Jireh he's just as much Jehovah Jireh today as he was with the mount on on Abraham with Abraham he can still produce an animal to his glory those squirrels was not just a vision I shot them blood came out of them I dressed them and I ate them they wasn't a vision they were squirrels and I said that same Jehovah Jireh trying to keep trying to get his promise over me in my thickness of my dullness of mind I could speak to my need into it I could speak my need into existence that same as he spoke Abraham's need into existence no more than I had said now I want you to listen to here now I said no more than I had said said that until sister Hattie sitting there crying now hadn't said a word and she said that's nothing but the truth see she said the right thing she said she said just look look Banks said down there I Heard a Voice see he brother Branham heard that same voice swept to my ears just like it was in the woods to speak those Scrolls into existence she said that's nothing but the truth and the loaning came up on brother Branham and he said you tell Hattie that she's found Grace in the sight of God who would have thought tell tell her to ask whatever she will and then speak it by the gift of existence whatever she asks speak it into existence and I looked at to my sister first time as I ever performed on a human and I said sister Hattie ask what you will God is going to give it to you God's going to give it to you this morning you just say that's exactly the truth this morning God's going to give it to you and what do you think of that does it does it get into you seven times and he had confirmed it by the animal seven is God's completed number here is the time the first time on a human on a human being and when he did he chose he didn't excuse me and he what did he choose some great some great noted Minister a poor little widow woman that could hardly write her name God knows what he's doing amen ask what you will had he said brother Branham what do you mean and I said ask anything your heart's desire and it shall be produced right here and you'll know the Lord the god of Heaven answers his scriptures are true and my first time with the with the new gift my first anointing I could hardly hear and she looked around and went and had been talking about her little crippled sister and I said oh he was thinking oh doubting my in his in his heart within a few minutes little Edith will be jumping up giving God the glory little Hattie looked around all over and she said brother Bill the greatest desire is for the Salvation of my two boys what the greatest desire is the Salvation of my two boys she was built for that moment brother Branham says it after this right after he says that it says while there couldn't have been a greater thing she could have asked for thousands of dollars she would have gotten it what if it had been millions of them she could have been a millionaire she could ask for another million God knew what she was going to ask for God knew where she'd be placed at that right moment at that right time what she was going to ask for the Salvation of her two boys that's what she was designed for at that moment in that hour he didn't just play somebody that would ask for wealth at that moment he didn't ask somebody that would just ask for just a a miracle yes it would have been a great thing but many people have seen Miracles but what's going to last is the Salvation of her two boys as he said as before there's going to be two boys I know it's going to be in heaven and that's Hattie writes boys amen see they were built for that moment that time and that place it might seem you might seem just you're like small and insignificant this morning you might say I have no purpose but you have a purpose God has placed you in your position at this right time amen you might not be a doctor you might not be a lawyer you might be a janitor but God has placed you in this moment at this right time Amen to give to you the Salvation that you need amen he comes to speak to you this morning the greatest thing that we could have is the Salvation that's what we're built for sent he sent us a lamb amen as Abraham or Adam and Eve came walking out of the garden he sent them a lamb salvation for them said I have made a way when we look to the Cross we can look to it this morning and say that's what we were built for that's what he did for us the salvation of our souls this morning that's the greatest thing we can have in Psalms 139 and 14 and it says I will praise the Lord for I am fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous are thy works that my soul knoweth the right way brother Tim Pruitt was speaking at that youth camp in Ohio I believe it was Timothy Pruitt Timothy Pruitt and the Lord spoke to him and said you go back and you tell them that you are fearfully and wonderfully made so I want to tell you this morning you are fearfully and wonderfully made in the eyes of God this morning amen don't look at what the world thinks that you should be look at to what God thinks you should be that's what you were built for that's what we were made for this morning amen we were fearfully and wonderfully made hey man so I want to take it even a little further this morning so we might have the best vehicle that's sitting in the parking lot we might have the best engine sitting in the in that vehicle the Best Transmission but unless you put tires on it unless you put the lug nuts on the tires it's not going to get nowhere many people will I won't go there but anyways they'll buy the best vehicle I'll take it this route they'll buy the best vehicle and they'll set it in a shop somewhere they won't fill it up they just want to look at it but that's not what it was made for it wasn't made to be put up on blocks and just set up here and just look at it and say this is what brother Branham said in this age and we're just not going to sit in there no more hey man we're not on blocks this morning hey man this is what we were built for we were made to roll on out of here amen God placed us here hey man we might have all the mechanics in the world but unless you have the Dynamics with

India that was over the top amen [Applause] isn't God good to us amen I want to just make a couple of announcements and we talk about miracles and things that brother Brandon sent this to us this week we had our our 32nd week ultrasound appointment at UVA we had a healthy four pound nine ounce baby earlier on on in the pregnancy they were telling us the head was really small in the five percentile but yesterday it was the 43rd percentile they didn't even mention her overall growth percentile but we assume it's close to the 43rd our God is so good [Applause] amen we're so glad to have brother Joel and sister rainy with us and they've been friends a long long time and amen we don't want to talk about how long a time it's been but brother Joel is one of my favorite people in the world and

absolutely bless we once again wish happy birthday to brother Bill and brother bill has been a deacon here since the beginning and he has probably baptized hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people he helped baptize me many years ago amen and so we're just we're so thankful he was there the night that I was seeking the baptism of the Holy Ghost and Jesus came amen and that's been a long time ago

be here amen thank you thank you for being here I'd like to congratulate again Reuben and Abigail they're probably watching the service congratulations to you the other day I as I was walking down the aisle I sat down with her and we didn't know what the evening's events was going to be like and and so I sat down with her and and the worship was going on and I just sat down and talked to her what I was really doing was picking up the spirit and and I said you know Abigail means one of this most brilliant women in the Bible smartest women she became David's counselor and she'll probably be Reuben's counselor through the life and so and and I just told her I said now that baby everything is going to be all right they would go home and then then her blood pressure would spike and those things and cause a little anxiety but Miss Ellie Grace came and perfectly well and so we thank the Lord for that give the Lord a good hand for them [Applause] [Music] today we want to announce congratulations to brother Gabriel and Sister Sarah they had an ultrasound this week and they have a healthy baby on the way [Applause] Hallelujah so they're going to need those other two rooms in that house and so we just are so pleased and happy for them amen isn't God so good he's just so absolutely good we just want to congratulate all of those that got baptized last night I was so thrilled it was so emotional to me in the water and to see those come in and and we are so thankful amen sister Devin we're so thankful for what God is doing in your life and amen we're with you we're with you the journey the journey may take a lot of turns and we may be unseen to that but Jesus will always be there with you and so in those moments of anxiety and things get real tight you just say father help me now amen God bless you we so love you with all of our hearts last night is the worship was going on I look back and saw sister Zoe she was shouting and and Andrew was singing and and she was just rowing backwards and forwards and her head laid back and her eyes closed and she was just shouting you know you know there may be some dead hits in this message but boy these children really like it so [Applause] amen so we love you amen amen we love you with all of our hearts and so this morning I I just have on my heart and I've had it for a few weeks and I just want to speak to you today and this will be kind of real close to me and I try not to get too emotional to it but the Lord just dropped in my heart and I I would say about four weeks ago On fight to live 15 years ago I laid in a coma and it was there that I would hear these words for the first time when they were taking me off of life support and a nurse was screaming in my ear and this will mean something to you she was screaming in my ear fight to live fight to live only you Ron can fight for your life now fight to live they were taking me off of the life support that it had me on almost a month and now it's one of the most treacherous times of coming off of the life support now to try to live on your own and she was screaming in my ear no doubt she had did that many times to to many different ones but today was my turn and as I thought you see there were times that in that induced coma to where that they would allow me to come up so far till they could measure how I was doing what my reactions was like and it was in one of those times to win that I was up just enough to be somewhat semi-conscious that I looked through the glass and their sister Connie and she had such a a look on her face hey one more time wanted to tell her I loved her I just wanted one more day with my family a couple of months ago while preparing for a test they were going to put me to sleep a lot of doctors and nurses around me and biopsies were going to happen and I heard the I heard the doctor tell the others said I must be losing my touch I can't make him go to sleep foreign and she said Ron you're going to be okay you're gonna be okay you're in good hands and she said what makes you relax the most what do you enjoy doing I said I enjoy spending time with my family I enjoy spitting it down with my friends and I heard her say good night Ron this morning has been a difficult morning foreign extremely difficult maybe it's supposed to be that way but I want you to know something I'm fighting maybe our young people don't understand what it's like to fight for life life is so precious sorry to be emotional it's so precious I took for granted life for so long Heaven's going to be a wonderful place many of our friends are already there I can't fathom what it's going to be like and I can't thousands of friends that'll come to shake my hand and tell me welcome home but I'd like for that to be a long way away and I want to spend every day that I have with you thank you to all the friends around the world that pray for me this week I've got some very difficult tests to take and the next week I've got scans to go through we made a choice in our early Journey to have extension of life and I thank God for every moment that I've had thank God for that I'd like to turn that to a spiritual Realm as the Bride of Jesus Christ is fighting in this darkness of laodicea it seems like there's a spiritual abortion that's happening not only in the church but in the bride or they no longer want the moving of the spirit no longer want that Holy Ghost Revival but they want to polish and Hollywood dies an intellectualizing explain the message away to where that it's it's digestible it happened in the early church where that that slaves had the Holy Ghost but now doctors and lawyers and and I don't mean no way for our lawyers sitting here to make it look bad to you but they they wanted to make it to where it would be polished to where that that the class of society would feel welcome in their churches but in bringing in the world you take God out of it let me just say you'll have to fight for life and as I brought myself into it whether you realize it or not to come to service and enjoy these Services the way you do you'll have to fight for life now there's a nation called Israel she can't afford to lose one day she can't she can't afford to lose one war her boundaries are set they negotiate and seems like the whole world is against her but she's actually the strongest army in the entire world because God is on her side not that she is strong with her own with her own self but God has made a choice and chose her God not only chose Israel but he chose this bride and he refuses to lose your War yeah he'll not lose a one [Music] he'll not lose a one so our boundaries are clear this message stands sure this message is real this message was more than a man called William Branham it was not his message and he made it clear to us you're not feeding on the mind of a man but you're feeding on the body word of the son of man and so with that we stand to our feet and and I've worked my way through my nervousness and the battle that I'm fighting with my own eyes and so so we thank you we thank you for your patience and I may take more than my 25 minutes if that's okay amen I went back and talked to brother Joel before service and I told him I said I make I break all the rules so you know amen in Psalms chapter 42 and verse 1 this is a very familiar portion of scripture Psalms 42 and verse 1. as a heart panteth for the water Brooks after the water Brooks so Panther my soul after thee o God my soul thirsteth for God for the Living God When shall I come and appear before God my tears have been my meat day and night while they continually say unto me where is thy God when I remember these things I pour out my soul in in me for I am had gone with the multitude I went with them to the house of God with the voice of joy and praise with a multitude that kept holy day where thou cast down O my soul and wire thou disquieting in me hold thou and God for I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance oh my God my soul is cast down Within Me therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan and or hermitite and and the hill of mizar deep calleth unto the Deep at the noise of thy water spouts all thy way waves thy and thy billas are gone over before me yet the Lord will command his loving kindness in the daytime and then the night his song shall be with me and my prayer unto God of my life I will say unto God my rock I thought thought of William when you were saying that last night where we were going this morning why hast thou forgotten me why go I mourning because of the oppression of my enemy as with a sword in my bones mine enemies reproach me while they say daily unto me where is thy God Amen you can be seated let me just make some adjustments here real quickly amen amen Isaiah chapter 43 and verse 1. but now thus saith the Lord that create Theo Jacob and he that formed the O Israel fear not ice these words for I have redeemed thee I like that I have called thee by thy name Thou Art mine Whitney this is your your picture on my wall when thou past us through others I will be with thee and through the rivers they shall not overflow thee when thou walkest through the fire they shall not be burned neither shall the flame Kindle upon thee for I am the Lord thy God the Holy One of Israel thy savior I gave Egypt for thy Ransom Ethiopian seba for thee since thou was precious in my sight thou has been honorable and I have loved thee therefore will I give men for thee and people for thy life fear not I am with thee it's quite a statement isn't it I will bring thy seed from the East and gather thee from the West I will say to the north give up and to the South keep not back bring my sons from the foreign daughters from the ends of the Earth even every one that is called by my name for I have created him for my glory I have formed him yea I have made him bring forth the blind people that have eyes and death that have ears let all the nations be gathered together let the people be assembled whom who among them can declare this and show us former things let them bring forth as for their witness that they may be justified or let them hear and say it is truth ye are my Witnesses saith the Lord and my servant whom I have chosen that ye may know and believe me and understand that I am hate before me there is no God formed neither shall there be after me I even I am the Lord and beside me there is no savior Paul would write it like this in First Corinthians chapter 15 behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall be changed in a moment in the twinkle of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptable and we shall be changed and this corruptable must put on incorruption and this Mortal shall put on immortality so when this corruptable shall have put on incorruption and this Mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the sand that is written death is swallowed up in Victory oh death where is thy stink oh grave where is thy victory The Sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law brother Branham said he wrote those words while they were sharpening the acts that would cut his head off Hallelujah what a powerful what a powerful words I've always found that this was an incredible statement brother Branham makes standing where brother Branham stood and fellowshipping with the angels he said if I should take a trip tonight and go up into heaven and to meet with Father Abraham and I'd say Abraham what is the most glorious thing that you have ever known what is the most essential thing that you have ever known and Abraham would say to me life eternal and then I'll take a little trip and we go again and we'd go up to the great Archangel Gabriel who is the messenger of the Covenant to the Israel the Jewish people who stands at the right hand of God one of the highest order of Angels in the heavens and they would say to him Gabriel Thou Art the mighty Angel who art loved of God and you've been here for eons of time and you perhaps know everything in the heavens and where everything is placed because you're the one of God's right-hand angels and you know the great secrets of heaven and you sounded the trumpet at the coming of the Lord Jesus and you announced the first coming and you shall announce the second coming and so you must be a mighty man or a mighty angel I want to ask you you in all of God's Great Treasures what is the greatest thing that you have found among his treasures and I can see Gabriel bring himself to attention and say the greatest thing that I have found in great in God's Treasures since he created me is life God made me to live for eternal for eternity life is the greatest thing that there is no matter how rich you might be no matter how popular you might be no matter who you might be the greatest thing that any man can achieve on this Earth is to achieve eternal life you might be a king a potentate though you rule the world for a million years as a king as a young man and you fail to find eternal life you've lost the greatest thing that anyone can lose I've often said if I be a young man 25 years old if God would appear on the platform tonight and say I will turn you to a 25 years old age and Daryl you'll remain for a million years and I'll make you King over all the universe everything will be at your command and I'll give you a hundred years of maybe or I'll give you a hundred years of misery and woe and trouble and sorrow and at the end of the Hundred Years I'll give you eternal life but at the end of a million years you'll be lost listen to his response I'd say Lord God I don't have to wait any longer to make the choice let me have that hundred years of misery and woe any kind of a death that you choose for me to die only Lord give me eternal life for though I own the whole world and and as a king for a million years and at the end of that million years become a hell-bound creature but no matter how bad my lot is here on Earth if I've got eternal life I'll live on you in your blessed presence forever and forever I pray that my grandchildren know this eternal life so many times we find life is difficult at its best we realize that there's no Miracles without messes Sarah endured 90 plus years the frustrating embarrassment of being barren it was a care it was a almost a curse in the world but there came a miracle there came a miracle by her way and that Miracle Oscar is there anything too hard for the Lord what and you know she even questioned and laughed for me an old woman how can I have pleasure again with my Lord Brother Branham talks about that how it would be for this modern Church world to go back to those Holy Ghost Field meetings of worshiping and speaking in tongues and the supernatural to be among us I'll read some of that in just a moment Isaac endured shattering through the through the darkness of night of blindness and it was because that God had to Blind him because Jacob he would have never chosen he would have chosen Esau over Jacob many many times but God had to Blind him so the blindness was a miracle for all of Israel there was a widow in her son that was starving to death just before dying God's sin Elijah to her place and ask her for her life sometimes he's asking for our life man called Shadrach Meshach and Abednego we know those names by heart since we were children but we would not know them had they have never stepped to info to a fiery furnace but before they stepped there there was a miracle of overcoming encouragement that was in their heart they knew their God if they die today they knew their God had the power to raise them back up again Bartimaeus experienced a lifetime of blindness being led to a gate experiencing a lot of things but one day Jesus came by his way from that day forward he was not the blind man anymore Legion was in tombs naked alienated from society and his family but Jesus came by his way from that day he was no longer called Legion anymore Lazarus was dead in a tomb had it been there seemed like Jesus had went away but when Jesus came by he became the Man known for the man that raised up out of the Grave because Jesus came and called him back to life again Daniel had been thrown into a lion's den and then that Lion's Den Angels stood by his side those same lines would later eat up his accusers but those same lines laid down and he enjoyed the night a kingdom was shaken but he enjoyed the night and the King came the next morning calling to his friend Hallelujah and he had a testimony that our God lives I have a testimony today there was a day they said I'd never walk again but I'm standing today there was a day they said my lungs would never function again but they function today there will be a day that I'll Stand and say I'm cancer-free when they said I'd never lived but four months there will be a day that I can stand and say cancer no longer holds me bound any longer you say brother on that's a pretty bold statement I gotta I got a quote for you he said Satan cannot take your life until God has finished with you there is nothing can happen to you unless God permits it there's no evil can come until God permits it and it's for your good in Acts chapter 3 and verse 1 and now Peter and John went up to the temple to The Hour of Prayer and it was the ninth hour and a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried whom they had laid there at Daily at the temple which was called Beautiful to ask Toms of him who had entered into the temple who jesusi and Peter and John about to go into the temple ask in the arms and Peter fastened his eyes upon him and with John said look on us and he gave heed unto them and expecting to receive something from them and Peter said Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have give I Thee in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk brother Graham said and when they passed through that date called Beautiful their laid a man the Holy Ghost said Peter that that that that man can be healed he's got faith and when he perceived he's had Faith to be healed he said stand upon your feet and he picked him up and held him till his ankle Bose receive strength and the way he went leaping and jumping and praising God you know what that caused more trouble than all the preaching that they ever did do brother let me just tell you that the on the phenomenal side to start watch how every Rogue and Hound in hell will go hollering at him craving blood I'll tell you Peter preached the on the sermon on the day of Pentecost three thousand Souls were saved the never leave the devil never even moved out of his bed said oh well just let him alone but when he passed through the date of beautiful the next day it healed a man crippled from his mother's womb and all hell turned loose on him throwed him in jail and kept him there overnight put him into a prison in the Inner Cell because of the phenomena the devil said I can't let this thing get started now Divine Healing if they do that they'll knock the props out from under me cause I might be fooled them around with a little theology once in a while but I can't fool them with that real thing [Applause] and the people will see it was done I'll just stop this before they ever gets the group started he never stopped it then he can't stop it now God's gospel will move on and on and on and on and when there is no more heavens and no more Earth that word will still remain the same for heavens and earth will pass away but my words will never pass away it can't pass away but this words is Heath mortal as God himself he can't pass away and I believe every word of it all things that Jesus was he is now and he always will be he's the same yesterday today and forever [Applause] the same holy ghost that fell on the day of Pentecost it's the same Holy Ghost today I'll admit it's been trampled on and made fun of and misinterpreted and misrepresented and everything like that that's only the devil trying to counterfeit it but there is a real genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost that'll bring the same results as it did on the day of Pentecost sure the devil's got old crave crowbates out there I'll tell you the truth every time you see a scarecrow remember there's something good around it you don't see a scarecrow on Old pineapples hedge apples you get under the big tree sweet trees it's where you see a script crew because they're wanting to scare us away the devil sticks out at every scarecrow real good Holy Ghost religion that he can to put it around it because right in there Jesus Christ the resurrected Son of God with his Immortal power he's still the same yesterday today and forever amen that means so be it right I'm just skipping as a little rabbit the story of the hounds was right behind him he could fill their hot breath upon his feet just a little while maybe another jump or two and the Hound was going to get that little fella and he would be godled up just in a moment but after a bit he saw the hole in the rock he thought if I could only get into that hole in the Rock I'll be safe and just as that dog made the last leap that last jump at him he could feel his hot breath on his heel but he run into that rock then it could set down there and let off the pressure [Music] that devil can scratch that Hound can scratch but it can't stretch through that rock when you see a man struggling to live there's somebody in the hospital or in a sick man or an accident or struggling the death rattle in their throat pulling and crying and screaming for Life what does it mean that there's a place somewhere there's a body that doesn't struggle and scream for that they're temporal gifts to us these are only expressing that there is one that that is eternal one that's what Jesus has gone away to prepare the Eternal one for us you know in your natural life you get married you have a new home but in a few days she'll go you know those walls I'd like for them to be a different color you just built that house and you'll think well I thought it was good but it was good for that day but now a few years later they've been look it looked better a different color so you paint it now if you live long enough she'll take pictures down off of the wall and she'll hang new pictures there be new flowers there and then a little while she'd say you know it's time to change the color of that wall it's just the seasons of life now you see Jesus knows when he went away to prepare a place for us he knew what you would like in your Eternal Realm and the amazing thing is you you'll like it for eternity because you don't really know what you like you really don't know what you'll like but he's prepared you a home that will be satisfactory throughout eternity Hallelujah [Applause] [Music] now today they are they've just discovered this last week that they discovered the pool where Jesus healed that man God always knew it was there but due to uncovering and Excavating and looking they found that place that's kind of like the message the seals were there but God blinded it from all of those schools and theologians and he had it laying there all the time and they tried to explain which one was the horse rider and and what the colors meant and and they did everything that they could to try to explain it but when the author himself met the messenger in Arizona and told him to go back east now you can try to explain that event away but there's been a lot of men stood right there on the same ground but they never came back east and opened the Bible but this messenger it was not him he was just the vessel and the author of the book wanted to give it to you not just any church but he wanted to give it to you now for a long time we preached God sent a prophet because that was the message of the day because we must identify that God had sent a prophet and we preached you know how we got to dress and how we got to do all that because we really needed the Holy Ghost and once you get the Holy Ghost you'll dress right all right and once you get the Holy Ghost you'll you'll only do the things where Jesus want to be at anyway you won't have to be beat no longer once you really get married to Jesus you won't want to disappoint him or make him ashamed but Allah he's are wanted to tell us some things about Isaac and he wasn't falling in love with elohiser we were falling in love with Isaac oh we're going to see Jesus and sure we'll love his appearing and we love his presence when he comes here but there comes a day one of these days we're going to see him because that's what Believers believe in the physical corporate return of Jesus Christ but now we struggle for life we get a cold and that coal will almost take your life you'll struggle with it for weeks you'll have a cough your your residue and everybody that gets around you they go she's got covet because you're struggling you wasn't made in that Eternal realm there were no coals but because of the fall of sin you were born in a body of Flesh and you struggle you have to have glasses teeth mine are glued in you you know before long you'll have to have artificial things to help you through life but it tells us that we're going to a land I don't know what they'll do with all of this metal that's in our bodies but we're going to a land where we're not going to need any of these things down here on this Earth [Applause] we say I do she stands in a beautiful dress most of the time you're standing in some sort of a tuxedo or a tie or a shirt that's nice and you make a promise that that you'll that you'll spend life together brother Rand said we step out of the realm of Eternity into a realm of time will go through life and we'll meet one another whoo she'll take your breath you've met a lot of girls but that one takes your breath and you'll just know that she's the right one I was standing the other day at Christmas Inn and the man named Jack he's a return retired sheriff's officer and he now is a he's now a a guy that takes your luggage in and out is what his daughter is the manager of the place and and he oh Jack looked at me and he said Ron I want to ask you a question how in the world did you ever get such a beautiful woman he said I'm just asking you honestly he said you look a lot older than she does he said she's a beautiful woman I didn't ask her for permission to tell this story and I said see Jack this is the deal have you ever heard about those blind days that's where the skin comes up over the snake's eyes I'm not calling her snake now and they become blind for a little while and and I said she was in that period of being blind and one day she woke up and she looked and you I said we've made it work out all these years huh I'll take you to dinner for better for worse now I'm talking about a natural marriage when you're standing there you don't think about cancer you don't think about being broke you don't think about bankruptcy in business you don't think about the struggles of life you don't think about I'm going to be a pastor's wife and watch my husband go through a lot of ups and downs in his life be there to to wipe his brow and to encourage him you don't think about that but life comes Matthew you said it right the trials of life you got to be tested to go through it and the only thing that will hold you is Jesus you come to church now I turn it just a little bit you come to church and you you at the first year it gets a little bit of a honeymoon experience everything seems good for a while but after a while the struggle starts and the enemy begins to work on you and he begins to test you and he begins to make a lot of fun of you and before long it's your energy that you got to struggle with maybe just to get to church maybe to pray maybe to read your Bible maybe to listen to tapes he'll present you with a lot of things in your life to try to get your attention in a lot of different directions but a God that's rich in Mercy he'll get you through the test of your life there will be mountaintops and there will be deep valleys but it's down in the valley it's where the real flowers and the real Gardens grow up on the mountaintops we all enjoy that but it's up there where you'll freeze in the winter that's why Paul could write it who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or parallel sword he could write it because he had felt it as it is written for thy sake were killed all the day long and were counted as a sheep for the slaughter nay and all these things we're more than conquerors through him that loved us for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels or principalities no powers nor things presence are things that come nor height nor death nor any other creature shall separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord the longer you're married the more you love one another the longer you're married the more in love with God you are anybody can serve him when everything's well when the bills are paid you're in a beautiful home your car's running good job's great marriage seem like it's a honeymoon every old hypocrite's happy but let it flip upside [Applause] let the doctor say words you know people panic when they just hear the word see and then it turns out it wasn't but there's sometimes it turns out it is and your whole perspective you don't believe me you hear a request you have prayer requested Happy Valley and you read those requests you know when you're reading about other people you know you have a a real heart for them but all of a sudden you're reading about yourself you're in the medical field and you know what I'm talking about you know when it's this guy or that woman or this one over here or maybe across the sea but all of a sudden it's your child all of a sudden it's you it's amazing how you can change from one day to another day now I want to come to this point and I'm just about done I go to the doctor I have a heed in my stomach it's a heat that you can feel on the outside I told sister Connie standing beside of a Christmas tree I said life couldn't be better in that rain we both were standing in aprons where we're going to have our whole family there brother Vernon you guys were coming for dinner and we were just looking forward to serving 30 to 40 people that day and and we said life could not be better I go to the doctor and he comes back in and he said Ryan I'm getting ready to send you down a dark Road I'd later ask him said how did you know that and he said you're a preacher and he said you can feel cancer he said I'm a doctor and I can feel it I'd go for tests I'd go for scans and I had a meeting to preach at that point it was just a thought we would go after Christmas after those days and we would go and we'd go to Dollywood God bless dolly we'd go to Dollywood and we'd be standing at a certain place right where where the Eagles are are caged they're a rehabilitation for Eagles we were standing right there when I got the call from the little Russian nurse you know her well sister Dolores and she said Ron you've you've got something in your lungs and and so sister Dolores I was getting ready to go home and I was going to fly to brother bissell's meeting and so sister Dolores call Connie and told her said you need to go with him because he's going to get some news he's supposed to get some news this week that's going to be disappointing and Connie called the airline and they placed her on the same seat right next to me on all the flights whoever that was was God ordained and she got her ticket cheaper than mine on the evening that I'm getting ready to go to the meeting I'm standing there and the sermon tonight is going to be called courage I'm going to preach to an audience of maybe six to seven hundred people on Courage I'd spoke it before but five minutes before I left the hotel room I get a call and that call would say Ron you have cancer it's in your lungs the sermon don't change the word of God don't change I'm preaching to you now my pastorship don't change God didn't change because I got a car there would be biopsies that I would have to go through there would be times of great fear great struggle one of the tumors was right beside of the atrial to my heart and they had to find out what was in it in the tumor and was quite a fearful thing they told me all the things that I might have might struggle with and I was laying and they kept flipping me around and flipping me around and say he was flipping me around I I was thinking there's no cancer there and finally one of the doctors came in and he put his head in the in that big you know what I'm talking about that big thing and he said Ron it's not that we can't find it it's just so much of it we got to pick the right place and he said would you like me to pray with you I said yeah I I would really like that Andrew had seen the lady doctor she had a Bible verse on her Bible and she quickly covered it up when Andrew pointed it out she didn't know what we were but we were believers let me just say we're real believers and we would say it like this though God slay me yet I'll trust him are you with me now Erica Reagan is in a fight for her life and that fight is very real you may have never got a diagnosis but listen when you get a diagnosis it's a struggle for life but many people don't know that the sword is coming and it's a fight for your life every day is a miracle for you you prayed with me and he said would you would you like to go to sleep I said yeah that'd be real nice he said well good night so he put me to sleep I've got a lot of great knock doctors I'll see some great doctors on on Tuesday they don't want me to go blind because the cancer is on the optical system I'm not afraid I spoke to brother Wayne Lawson yesterday for about 40 minutes we talked about life we talked about things he asked me what I was thinking as I was facing trials and I said brother Wayne wherever it takes me he's with me at the end of it brother Wayne's making about a 10-hour Journey brother Joel you'll like this you know God don't have to tell you things some things seem so insignificant but yet so great at the end of it I just sent brother Wayne a note this is exactly where you are in your journey and I talked to him for about 40 minutes and the Lord Dropped In My Heart of his 10-hour Journey exactly where he was you know sometimes in your journey of life it just seemed so insignificant but God just tells you this is exactly where you are Andrew Matthew every day is a miracle we share together every day is a miracle when I get to enjoy my grandbabies every day is a miracle when I get to stand in front of this audience again every day now for me my struggle might be a little different than yours my fight might be a little different than yours maybe sometimes you don't realize that you see people jumping and shouting praising the Lord you don't know what they went through for the week and maybe you're watching my internet and you're going that bunch is just emotional well what you don't realize we may be that emotional part of Heaven [Applause] we might be that rivers of life section that's over there where the leaves are waving and where the stream is a bubbling now for the critic they might be the desert where everything is sticky and punchy now let me just say that's a real tough place to live and I understand that you want to be our critic but you might ought to see where you're at you don't have to live in the desert [Applause] [Music] you don't have to stay there you can rise and have a fresh and true Revival oh brother Ron one day you'll mature in the message can I give you one more story before we close brother Branham had a little group come over to his church and that little group came over and they were going to do some singing for him and and brother Branham was sitting there and he was watching them one of them grabbed a washboard and another one grabbed a tambourine and they started singing and they were playing that washboard and one was playing that piano and before long one of those sisters was was a dancing and she was throwing her head in a certain way and brother random began to make some statements like a lot of people do and he said they're going to turn my church into a hoedown now this might help you the angel started talking to him you know the one that revealed the seals you know the one that talked with him about getting some squirrels you know the one that talked to him about you know talking to that storm and telling it to go back where it came from you know the same one that said Sun stand still you know the one that told Moses to stretch his Rod out over the sea that one and that one said if you had the victory that she had [Laughter] if you had the victory that she had what was that song we got sent to us this morning Satan your kingdom is coming down oh Satan your kingdom is coming down oh I Heard a Voice from Heaven say Satan your kingdom is coming down there was a fella sitting on the stage he was looking around how everybody was enjoying the service and he was looking this way and he was looking that way and he's looking that way now you know all he needed to do was put his hand on his foot on his leg a little bit now brother Branham said after the angel talked to him if you had the victory she had he said I started patting my foot oh brother Ron but I'm afraid I'll get in the flesh we'll just start patting your foot a little bit and then he started patting his knee now you know what he said he said I found myself out in the floor doing the same thing that she was doing [Applause] oh but I can hear the critics say well that was before the seals well let me give you one just before he passed away invisible Union of the Bride he said that modern Church don't want any of these acts 2 38. screaming whooping youngins miserable creatures she thinks they are the modern Church don't want none of them but that's the only kind that the word can produce I don't know what kind your church is wanting but I want that kind [Applause] so therefore we're fighting for our life oh little rabbit but death is trying to get a hold to you it's trying to get a hold

with every fiber of my being and I'll say it's worth fighting for I was talking to Malachi and Khloe last night where you have a little Fellowship after service I said if there's one thing that I want to see it's the change right there it's a change to watch these molecules change to watch old skin become loose skin waking up with different pain in your body every single day where'd that one come from what I do yesterday to think that one of these Mormons you're going to wake up and you're not going to have no pain maybe today could have been the last day that you woke up and sat on the side of the bed and you read your Bible or you made up maybe you had a little prayer before you got out of the bed and you wanted to make sure you made that first step right today could have been the last day that you made that kind of commitment that I've got to get up slowly tomorrow could be the morning that you wake up and all of your body parts are starting to change you look in the mirror and everything everything that you're looking at is completely different I think I'm gonna have a Time I think I just have myself I might tell I might tear my little cabin out there in them Woods I might tear it down and burn it because I ain't gonna need it much longer if I see these molecules start changing you can have everything I got you can have the deed in my home you can have this church you can have my cars you can have all you want to because I ain't going to need them much longer because change is upon my body well come on somebody give him praise are you looking for the change amen amen amen we're going to let you be dismissed today we just love the Lord with all of our heart we thank you for being a part of these services this weekend participating I we enjoy these these Services they come once a year and we certainly appreciate how the Lord dovetails and matches everything up perfectly together and I'm so glad that we can hide under the rock I'd say it's worth fighting for don't you I think we ought to jump with everything that's within us to get inside of the Rock Amen why don't you turn to your neighbor greet them God bless them and and send them on their way tell them be looking for change be looking for change amen I feel the poor amen God bless you today you're dismissed in the name of the Lord I feel the pool I hear the call and I know his Spirit Rich moving me to give my own peace through oh and I agree [Music]
