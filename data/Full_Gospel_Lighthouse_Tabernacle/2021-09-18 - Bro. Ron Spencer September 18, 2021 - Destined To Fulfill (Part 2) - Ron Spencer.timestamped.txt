[12:45] [Music]
[12:57] [Music]
[13:00] unchanging
[13:07] amen
[13:10] i'd like to give a
[13:12] just a quick testimony tonight of
[13:14] something the lord's done
[13:16] for me if i could real quick
[13:19] brother ron spoke about it
[13:21] just a couple weeks ago and it's been
[13:23] something that's been the lord's just
[13:24] been unfolding for a while
[13:26] and for those that are streaming i'll
[13:28] just take it back to
[13:29] december last year me and brother greg
[13:32] working together
[13:34] there at the shops with the railroad and
[13:37] they closed our shop and done away with
[13:39] our job but god come he provided a way
[13:42] quickly
[13:43] gave us a wonderful brother and sister
[13:45] who would speak for us
[13:47] get us a good job and i knew it was of
[13:48] the lord because
[13:50] something like that happened two guys
[13:52] lose a job work together and then they
[13:54] can go and get the same job same shift
[13:56] start the same day working with one
[13:58] another it was just blessing of the lord
[14:01] and i'm so thankful
[14:03] but as i found my brother got to praying
[14:05] because he didn't like that graveyard
[14:06] coming
[14:08] and he testified to me how he got the
[14:10] praying for god to restore his job and
[14:12] god did he brought brother greg back
[14:15] to his job
[14:17] and then sister connie mays got to
[14:19] speaking and telling me what the lord
[14:21] had done for her and she didn't realize
[14:22] how it was speaking to my heart
[14:24] because i at that point done started on
[14:26] graveyard and i i was pretty positive
[14:28] about it i thought i was straight
[14:29] graveyard was going to be all right but
[14:30] that started whooping me i'm going to
[14:32] tell you the truth
[14:33] i think the lord gave a chicken enough
[14:35] sense to go to bed when the sun sets
[14:38] and get up with the sun evidently that's
[14:40] for me too
[14:43] but with greg's testimony and connie's
[14:46] testimony stirred my heart and i said
[14:47] god you're not a respecter of persons
[14:49] and what you do for one you'll do for
[14:51] another
[14:52] and
[14:53] i started calling on the lord and i tell
[14:55] you it didn't look it didn't look very
[14:56] good that there was a chance for me to
[14:58] get back to the railroad and me and greg
[15:00] both having
[15:01] just about the same amount of time even
[15:03] on the railroad together
[15:05] but i got the calling on the lord and
[15:08] i hadn't really said nothing to no one
[15:11] me and jenny only ones known about it
[15:14] and then i mentioned to greg maybe i was
[15:16] thinking
[15:17] about trying to get back to the railroad
[15:19] but
[15:19] it was pretty secret thing i didn't know
[15:22] how it would go but i started praying to
[15:24] the lord and he started moving and and
[15:28] things started taking place and
[15:32] greg said you know there's a position
[15:33] coming up on the cw
[15:35] and it's very difficult to get on the cw
[15:37] no one even knowed how to get on over
[15:39] there it's norfolk southern but it ain't
[15:40] union and they couldn't even tell me
[15:42] they don't know how you hire how you get
[15:44] on over there but it's great hours but
[15:46] it's a difficult way to get in but i
[15:48] know a god that does the impossible
[15:51] i said that would be nice greg texted me
[15:53] back he said why not
[15:55] i said well you're right
[15:57] why not that's our god now you're going
[15:59] to call on him i've heard ask for big
[16:01] things
[16:03] so we started praying about it man jenny
[16:05] and sure enough
[16:07] i got an interview
[16:09] and uh
[16:10] the interview went well
[16:13] we came here and it was on a
[16:16] friday
[16:17] we was moving the chairs in here when we
[16:19] was changing things around i had the
[16:21] interview that day
[16:22] i think it was that saturday that very
[16:24] saturday y'all had a prayer line here
[16:26] but i had to go to work
[16:28] i'd ask jenny i said
[16:30] you know
[16:32] go through the prayer line for our son
[16:33] dylan and pray about this job situation
[16:36] because
[16:37] i was i was worried i wanted to do
[16:41] what the lord's will is you know i might
[16:43] be wanting to get back to the railroad
[16:44] but i wasn't sure if he was wanting me
[16:46] back to the railroad or not because i
[16:47] knew he clearly got me that job at mckee
[16:50] and uh
[16:52] so i just wanted to know from the lord
[16:53] not just ask god i said god
[16:55] you you came to gilead
[16:57] and an angel spoke with gilead and i
[16:59] said you know we don't seek for signs
[17:02] but i said but lord he stood and he
[17:04] talked with an angel and then he asked
[17:06] for a sign and you gave him a sign and
[17:08] he turned and he asked for another sign
[17:09] you gave him another sign i said i just
[17:12] i'm just wanting to know lord because
[17:13] it's important to me i want to be at
[17:15] church when the doors are open i don't
[17:16] want to take a job that's going to take
[17:18] me away from being here
[17:21] and about the only thing i could stand
[17:22] and tell the lord i said lord you know
[17:24] my heart since the day you've opened my
[17:26] eyes if these doors are open i've never
[17:28] put nothing in front of coming here i
[17:30] want to be here it's a hunger in my
[17:31] heart to be here and i thank him for
[17:33] that hunger he put that hunger in me
[17:37] so
[17:38] i told jenny we come i said you go
[17:40] through that line for dylan and and for
[17:42] me in that job situation when you go
[17:44] through the prayer line and with the
[17:45] service unfolded
[17:47] just something spoke to my heart before
[17:49] time for me to get up and leave and i
[17:51] just knew because we'd been doing a lot
[17:52] of praying i said god knows about the
[17:53] job situation
[17:55] i don't know why but i just it was in my
[17:57] heart and i just knew if
[17:59] if it was important to god he was going
[18:01] to let brother ron know i leaned over to
[18:03] jenny before i left i said don't mention
[18:05] the job situation you just pray for
[18:08] dylan go through that line for dylan
[18:10] i didn't tell her about what i felt on
[18:12] my heart to preach and what's going on
[18:13] so i just said
[18:14] let the job situation go so i went on to
[18:17] work
[18:18] and that night about one o'clock when i
[18:19] come out on break i had two texts one
[18:21] from jenny
[18:23] one from brother ron
[18:24] and jenny told me she come through at
[18:26] prayer line she said i went to walk away
[18:27] brother ron grabbed me on the shoulder
[18:29] he said god's got that job situation
[18:33] i was hooked
[18:34] i know then i was getting my answer what
[18:36] i wanted
[18:38] and i was excited and sunday i didn't
[18:40] get to talk to brother on that
[18:43] sunday at church but i gave him time to
[18:45] get home and i shot him a text i got
[18:47] some good news i want to share with him
[18:49] i said
[18:50] you got time i'd like to tell you about
[18:52] the goodness of the lord when he's done
[18:53] for me and he shot me right back he said
[18:55] call me
[18:56] so i called him up and i said brother
[18:57] ron i said
[18:59] i told him how the lord what he had done
[19:00] he said
[19:02] let me let me tell you something
[19:04] he said he gave me the date it's been a
[19:06] while i can't remember the days but the
[19:08] day that he was speaking of was three

[19:12] with norfolk southern
[19:14] he said i was at an auction and there
[19:16] was a statue a figure of a conductor
[19:19] he said i wasn't even interested in it
[19:21] he said but god spoke to him and told
[19:23] him i was going to be a conductor on the
[19:24] railroad that was three weeks before
[19:26] norfolk southern even knew i was going
[19:28] to be a conductor on the railroad god
[19:29] knew
[19:30] it took me a day after to even gather up
[19:32] that was two signs just like gilead i
[19:34] didn't ask for two but god so cares he
[19:37] gave us to
[19:38] and i love him and i just want to thank

[24:02] maybe sister whitney spencer
[24:05] come sing for us this evening if she
[24:07] would
[24:10] as she's preparing to come i want to
[24:11] read a couple of announcements here
[24:15] we have changed over to the new church
[24:18] messaging system
[24:20] and i believe several people have asked
[24:22] about this
[24:23] on one of the texts that says there
[24:25] might be data charges whatsoever those
[24:28] data charges are covered by the church
[24:30] so no one would have to pay any of the
[24:32] data charges
[24:34] for those things so there were some
[24:36] questions about that so we want to make
[24:38] sure that that's clear so you'll you'll
[24:40] be receiving text messages from another
[24:42] way
[24:43] than what we've been using because that
[24:47] the messaging system we used before was
[24:49] costing way too much and we could only
[24:51] send an allotted amount of message
[24:54] so we want to
[24:55] let y'all be aware of that
[25:00] we're going to have a much needed day of
[25:02] fellowship
[25:03] and we're all excited about this it's
[25:05] going to be on sunday
[25:07] october the 3rd
[25:09] it's going to be at grand caverns
[25:12] at the large shelter i got another paper
[25:14] that goes here with this
[25:18] and that's going to be at 11 a.m there
[25:20] will be food fellowship games for all
[25:24] and
[25:25] for all that is attending their october
[25:27] gathering
[25:28] please bring a covered dish and a
[25:30] dessert
[25:31] to make sure it's enough to feed your
[25:33] family
[25:35] so
[25:36] we want to be remembering that
[25:38] we need to know who all would be
[25:40] attending by september the 18th so we
[25:43] have enough meats to
[25:44] to prepare
[25:46] there will be pig roast hamburgers and
[25:47] hot dogs for that
[25:50] and

[33:29] asked you all to pray about it
[33:31] so thank you guys for that
[33:33] and um
[33:35] last weekend
[33:51] what he's done for us
[33:53] he and
[33:55] roshan just leaned over and said
[33:58] by the way i'm still praying for your
[33:59] mother
[34:01] completely not even a trace be left
[34:04] and i
[34:05] forgot to look it up here but it was

[34:08] week she went back to the doctor that
[34:10] was still helping her with it and doing
[34:12] some therapy and stuff
[34:13] and
[34:15] my dad
[34:16] sent me a text and said
[34:18] god the answer's prayer is exactly what
[34:20] we asked for and he the doctor
[34:23] i guess went through whatever
[34:25] and tried all different things
[34:28] okay so praise the lord
[34:31] [Applause]
[34:57] that saturday
[35:00] night anyway she got the results back it
[35:03] was blood poorly and stuff
[35:06] was
[35:07] out of place
[35:13] and no one i don't know a whole lot
[35:15] about it but i guess a lot of different

[44:33] one day it will set empty
[44:35] to where that there was a people here
[44:38] that came and worshiped but
[44:41] mysteriously they're gone

[45:09] sinus area the the time of year lord i
[45:13] just ask you that you would touch their
[45:14] bodies
[45:15] and minister to them in a special way we
[45:18] pray in jesus christ's name we ask you
[45:20] amen and amen amen god bless you
[45:24] brother bill god bless you good to see
[45:26] you back with us amen
[45:28] amen to be a survivor of all of that is
[45:31] it's a good thing
[45:33] amen it's a good thing and
[45:35] amen
[45:36] when you come through on that other end
[45:38] of that that thing there's too many
[45:39] people that's passing away with it
[45:42] and uh it's a it's a it's good to have a
[45:44] victor and so amen brother homer
[45:47] longoria lost his son-in-law this week
[45:50] his name was runt or his nickname was
[45:52] runt and that's what we all knew him by
[45:54] real good guy i i loved him and and lost
[45:58] him this week to that then another
[46:00] sister in his church lost him to that so
[46:02] don't don't let your guard down too much
[46:04] and so
[46:05] amen it's a it's a real deal
[46:08] and so amen and and so we
[46:11] we just know those things
[46:12] andrew was sent a text this week and and
[46:15] it
[46:16] meant a lot to andrew and then when he
[46:18] sent it to me it meant a lot to me and
[46:21] i want to just share it with you and
[46:23] uh
[46:24] the author of this wanted to remain
[46:26] anonymous and he said i heard a preacher
[46:29] make a statement
[46:31] that made me think of your dad the other
[46:34] day
[46:35] he said it doesn't cost anything to
[46:38] declare war
[46:41] but it cost a lot to win
[46:45] it got me to thinking it's easy for
[46:47] people to sit in the comfort of their
[46:49] blessings
[46:51] and say they're declaring war against
[46:53] satan
[46:54] but declaring war and waging war
[46:58] are two
[46:59] different things
[47:01] altogether
[47:03] war is bloody
[47:05] war costs lives
[47:07] war leaves scars i'm thankful for
[47:11] soldiers as brother ron and yourself and
[47:13] not only to declare war but will lead by
[47:16] example as we wage war and win
[47:20] by the grace of god
[47:22] i thought that was well written and
[47:24] i was glad to hear those things
[47:26] we'd like for you to remember us this
[47:28] week
[47:29] uh a couple several things are going on
[47:31] this week but
[47:33] we'll we'll be preparing to go to
[47:34] brother kelly hildebrandt's to speak in
[47:36] his convention
[47:38] and
[47:39] and to me
[47:41] this is a dream come true i i just have
[47:44] to be honest with you
[47:45] i never thought i'd ever
[47:47] ever travel to brother kelly's again to
[47:50] to speak a meeting i i thought that
[47:53] you know you just get it in your mind
[47:55] this
[47:56] this part of your life is over
[47:58] and you're just going to kind of just
[48:00] set this out the rest of the way and so
[48:03] as we begin to approach it brother kelly
[48:05] for the last year said i want you to
[48:07] come
[48:08] and
[48:10] cancer rage war
[48:12] and we
[48:13] continue to take our chemo treatments
[48:15] every day
[48:16] morning and then afternoon
[48:19] and every day is different
[48:21] one day your sugar will be
[48:23] 600 all day the next day today i've
[48:26] thought to keep my sugar
[48:28] above 100 so
[48:30] ah
[48:31] just it's just how it is
[48:33] and so and so at any rate we we
[48:38] we wanted to go and we we we wanted to
[48:41] be a part of those meetings and
[48:44] as time would come and covet conditions
[48:46] would be there as well didn't know if
[48:48] they could have the meetings
[48:50] actually they just reinstated their
[48:52] complete ban of their complete uh
[48:55] everybody has to wear a mask there now
[48:57] and so and so we
[48:59] their nation is is headed in that in
[49:02] that direction again and so
[49:04] so as we go and i i just ask you that
[49:07] you would pray for us
[49:09] and uh pray that that we can
[49:11] that we can get through all of the
[49:14] the borders and and do well
[49:16] and uh because this will be the first
[49:19] time that i've traveled across a border
[49:20] with with the chemo that i have to take
[49:23] and all of the drugs i take about 20
[49:26] different peels a day
[49:27] and uh
[49:30] that is
[49:31] part of the support system to wear that
[49:33] helps me to get through the day
[49:35] i thank god for good doctors i i really
[49:38] do
[49:39] i got something this week from the uh
[49:42] mayo clinic and it was a youtube
[49:44] deal from from them and
[49:47] they were talking about the very disease
[49:48] that i have and the conditions that are
[49:51] matching that's what i what what i have
[49:53] and
[49:54] they have people on the same drugs that
[49:56] what they do and so this was a doctor's
[49:59] conversation and i shared this with
[50:01] brother nathanael earlier this week
[50:04] and anyway they were they were saying
[50:06] that
[50:07] when you first get diagnosed with with
[50:09] the kind of disease that we've got to
[50:11] give you about three months to live
[50:14] and if the medicine can take a holt
[50:17] somewhere
[50:18] somewhere about 50 percent
[50:21] of the people survive for a year
[50:24] and so then
[50:26] that's at stage three but i have stage
[50:28] four and they and it gets about 20
[50:32] and so then they were going down the
[50:34] line and
[50:35] and
[50:36] mayo clinic hasn't had anyone to live
[50:39] two years
[50:41] in this situation
[50:42] [Music]
[50:44] where we're coming up on is our two year
[50:46] anniversary
[51:01] and
[51:02] and i know you you see me here speaking
[51:05] and
[51:06] never take it for granted and i shared
[51:08] this with my family this week
[51:10] never take it for granted
[51:12] that well that's the way it's always
[51:14] going to be
[51:15] because we're fighting the death enemy
[51:18] and this is not this is not a coal
[51:21] it's a death enemy that we're fighting
[51:23] and so if you would remember us in
[51:24] prayer as we traveled there
[51:26] and so we're just honored to be a part
[51:28] of that meeting we've seen so much
[51:30] supernatural at brother kelly's church
[51:33] we've seen supernatural around the world
[51:35] and been a part of a lot of very special
[51:38] things and we could testify all night
[51:40] long about that
[51:42] but
[51:43] i i would like for you to remember us in
[51:46] prayer that god would give us strength
[51:48] sometimes i struggle with the strength
[51:50] that i need to be able to do what i need
[51:52] to do
[51:53] and so we just we're just thankful that
[51:55] we're able to be a part of that
[51:57] amen glad that brother andrew could be a
[52:00] part of what he was doing this week and
[52:02] so
[52:04] we're just thankful for that looking
[52:06] forward to the fall fellowship
[52:09] i'm looking forward to that i enjoy that
[52:11] day i
[52:12] uh you know we we'll be together and one
[52:15] of these days it's kind of like a type
[52:17] of one of these days we'll all be
[52:18] together in that realm
[52:20] over their fellowshipping together and
[52:22] so
[52:23] we're certainly looking forward to that
[52:25] we'll be we'll be speaking at brother
[52:27] tim pruitt's meeting in october
[52:30] about the first or second week i think

[53:46] i sat at today and i just want to have a
[53:48] couple of opening statements before i
[53:50] just go and
[53:51] i i won't try to be too long tonight but
[53:54] i sat today at brother
[53:56] meadows 90th birthday celebration
[54:00] the family gave him his 90th birthday
[54:11] now if 90 looks like that i don't mind
[54:14] making it
[54:16] brother meadows is one of the strongest
[54:18] people that physically that i've ever
[54:20] met in
[54:21] and he might be at a stage now in his
[54:23] life he can't hear thunder
[54:27] maybe there's times he don't remember
[54:29] what he ate for breakfast yesterday but
[54:31] it really don't matter anyway and so
[54:34] and you know as far as not being able to
[54:36] hear there's some things that's not
[54:37] worth listening to so
[54:43] i was with an elderly preacher one time
[54:45] and we were we were together and his
[54:47] wife was being a little mighty and
[54:48] chatty in the back seat
[54:51] and we were he was taking us to eat
[54:54] and she was just biting biting biting
[54:56] and
[54:57] he was just ignoring ignoring annoying
[55:01] and so we got to the bob evans where we
[55:04] were going to eat at and we got he got
[55:06] out and he met me at the front of the
[55:07] car
[55:09] and he just looked at me and he said
[55:10] brother ron
[55:11] there comes a time
[55:13] to when you came here is a great thing
[55:27] hallelujah
[55:30] brother branham speaks a sermon called
[55:32] it becometh us to fulfill all
[55:34] righteousness
[55:37] and now he's speaking personal to the
[55:39] congregation that he would be speaking
[55:41] to
[55:43] and brother branham begins to explain
[55:45] kind of like what we went through last
[55:47] week he explains to us that
[55:49] of how that he saw visions and
[55:52] and the vision would carry him to canada
[55:54] or or to a place there in the north
[55:56] country and
[55:58] and he would explain what the 42-inch
[56:01] horned animal would be he didn't know it
[56:03] would be a caribou because most caribou
[56:05] have paddle paneled horns and
[56:09] and then then before he would even get
[56:11] back down to the camp he would kill a
[56:13] silver tip grizzly bear
[56:15] and he would share this vision with the
[56:17] brothers that he would be hunting with
[56:19] and
[56:20] and he would be one place or another and
[56:22] he would share that and as he's standing
[56:24] in the audience this day as he's
[56:27] beginning to preach
[56:28] it becometh us
[56:30] to fulfill all righteousness
[56:34] and he begins to lay out how that they
[56:36] were there and how the vision happened
[56:38] exactly like
[56:39] brother biscuit didn't even know that he
[56:42] had that shirt on that checkered shirt
[56:44] green checkered shirt he didn't realize
[56:46] he told his wife not to pack it because
[56:48] it had some holes and she'd pressed it
[56:51] got it ready cleaned it put it in his
[56:53] anyway and and he had fell in the water
[56:56] and would put that shirt on not thinking
[56:59] anything about it he'd put that shirt on
[57:01] and be wearing it that day and
[57:04] and his brother branham is standing over
[57:06] top of the hor over top of the animal
[57:08] there and he turns and brother biscuits
[57:10] got the but got the shirt
[57:13] and then the young man that would be
[57:15] there would be blaine
[57:17] blaine would would just come in
[57:18] surprisingly for the meeting for the for
[57:21] the hunt
[57:22] and blaine was brother sophomore son and
[57:24] so he comes in and when they're
[57:26] measuring the the horns
[57:29] blaine puts his hands to hold the ruler
[57:31] down on the horns and when he measured
[57:33] them it was exactly
[57:36] 42 inches
[57:39] now here was brother biscuit's testimony
[57:41] and i've been with him a bit
[57:42] he said if it had been 42 and a quarter
[57:47] there would have been doubt
[57:50] if it had been 39 and three quarters
[57:54] there would have been doubt in my mind
[57:56] he said but i watched as that that
[58:00] measuring tape was exactly on the line
[58:04] 42 inches
[58:06] and then brother branham explains as
[58:08] they're going back down over the
[58:10] mountain and they're just giving some
[58:11] testimonies
[58:13] and uh
[58:14] he's going down and he he asks brother
[58:16] buddy says he said we can see for a
[58:18] couple of miles here
[58:21] and he said but he said but brother
[58:23] branham he says uh you you said in the
[58:25] vision
[58:26] that
[58:27] that we would get a silver tipped
[58:29] grizzly bear he said i've never seen one
[58:33] he said but you said in the vision we'd
[58:34] get a silver-tipped grizzly bear before
[58:37] we got back to the camp
[58:40] and so
[58:42] brother branham explains to him that
[58:43] he's still jehovah jireh
[58:47] you remember abraham was standing there
[58:50] with his son and his son said we have
[58:52] wood and we have fire
[58:56] but we have no sacrifice
[58:59] abraham knew that he was going to be a
[59:02] type of of god
[59:05] he would lay down his son he would offer
[59:06] his son
[59:08] but he remembered the promise that
[59:10] melchizedek told him that he'd be the
[59:12] father of nations
[59:13] and this would be the child that he
[59:15] would want that he would wait for until
[59:18] his very old age a hundred years old
[59:21] and god would change his body to where
[59:23] he could have that son
[59:25] now if god's asking him to offer him as
[59:29] a sacrifice
[59:32] that god that has changed his body
[59:35] that after all of these years has
[59:37] performed the promise
[59:39] is more than able
[59:45] let me just say it wasn't just he came
[59:47] to the end of his age and now god asked
[59:49] him listen there had been a lot of
[59:51] trials that he had watched god maneuver
[59:54] him through
[59:56] he had watched god speak and perform
[59:59] speak
[1:00:00] and perform
[1:00:02] he had watched him change his name
[1:00:04] changed sarah's name he had watched him
[1:00:06] walk through the beast of the sacrifice
[1:00:09] he had watched him over and over when he
[1:00:12] told him that the uh to separate with
[1:00:14] him and lot
[1:00:16] and let lot make his choice
[1:00:20] let him make his choice and lot made his
[1:00:24] choice
[1:00:25] and he stayed back
[1:00:27] god came and visited abraham
[1:00:30] after lot made his choice
[1:00:35] are you with me let me just say abraham
[1:00:38] did not have a bible to read
[1:00:42] he didn't have a bible to read
[1:00:44] all he knowed what he was following the
[1:00:47] voice of the lord that was in his life
[1:00:52] it wasn't speaking to sarah it wasn't
[1:00:55] speaking to eliza it was speaking to
[1:00:57] abraham
[1:00:59] are you with me and we trust that voice
[1:01:02] because we've seen him do it so many
[1:01:06] times in our life
[1:01:09] are you with me now
[1:01:10] brother branham could stand there night
[1:01:12] after night after night and it would
[1:01:14] build through his life because he had
[1:01:17] saw that angel of the lord
[1:01:20] he had saw the son of man ministry
[1:01:22] happen so many times regardless of the
[1:01:26] case
[1:01:27] regardless of the situation he knew god
[1:01:30] was more than able
[1:01:32] whether it was a dead baby in mexico
[1:01:36] or a blind man in bombay
[1:01:39] are you with me now
[1:01:40] no matter the situation he knew god was
[1:01:43] in control if he spoke it
[1:01:48] if he spoke it he was more than able to
[1:01:50] fulfill it
[1:01:52] [Music]
[1:01:53] now you and i live in a world today that
[1:01:56] that proclaims a lot of things
[1:01:59] but they can't fulfill it
[1:02:01] they can't meet the expectations
[1:02:05] it's because anything that's man-made
[1:02:09] will fail you
[1:02:14] when jesus stepped into the water
[1:02:19] to be baptized of john
[1:02:23] if you remember
[1:02:25] if you remember even brother branham
[1:02:27] wondered why jesus had to be baptized
[1:02:29] like that
[1:02:30] there were some thoughts
[1:02:32] and there was a lot of people asking
[1:02:34] well why did jesus need to be baptized
[1:02:38] the sacrifice had to be washed
[1:02:42] it had to be washed and jesus was a
[1:02:44] supreme sacrifice
[1:02:46] and jesus would meet
[1:02:48] his cousin that was the prophet
[1:02:52] i'm sure that stumbled a lot of people
[1:02:56] watch just a family thing
[1:03:00] it wasn't to the world to catch
[1:03:02] it was just for a select people that
[1:03:04] were on a destiny
[1:03:08] and listen when jesus stepped into the
[1:03:10] water with john and john said i have
[1:03:13] need to be baptized with thee
[1:03:16] but it becometh us to fulfill
[1:03:20] oh righteousness
[1:03:23] we've got a script that we've got to go
[1:03:25] by we've got to fulfill this part
[1:03:30] listen jesus looked at the scriptures of
[1:03:33] what was prophesied of him
[1:03:35] and he saw himself in the scriptures
[1:03:39] of his earthly ministry of what his
[1:03:42] earthly and you have to you have to
[1:03:44] divide the two his earthly ministry
[1:03:48] and that that final ministry i want you
[1:03:50] to understand jesus knew that he would
[1:03:53] be here just a small amount of time
[1:03:56] but he came here to die
[1:03:58] he came here to redeem
[1:04:01] he could have had a family
[1:04:05] he could have produced children on his
[1:04:07] own
[1:04:08] he could have had a kingdom but he was a
[1:04:11] king of it all
[1:04:13] hallelujah and what a family that he has
[1:04:16] today
[1:04:24] i want you to just watch this jesus is
[1:04:26] standing and these scriptures sometimes
[1:04:28] just kind of go
[1:04:29] quickly for us but jesus is standing
[1:04:31] with his disciples and believers that
[1:04:33] are there
[1:04:35] and he's projecting
[1:04:38] he's projecting past
[1:04:40] [Music]
[1:04:41] even present
[1:04:43] and even projecting what we're doing
[1:04:48] so some of these scriptures
[1:04:49] we're going to fulfill
[1:04:53] we're going to fulfill
[1:04:58] in john in luke chapter 17 and verse 25
[1:05:01] he says
[1:05:02] but first he must suffer many things
[1:05:06] and be rejected of this generation
[1:05:09] jesus is talking about himself
[1:05:11] let me just say if you were walking with
[1:05:13] jesus in his ministry
[1:05:15] it had been very difficult for you to
[1:05:17] watch him be beat
[1:05:21] because in our mortality we do not
[1:05:24] understand everything
[1:05:32] and as it was in the days of noah
[1:05:36] so shall it be in the coming of the son
[1:05:37] of man
[1:05:40] they did eat
[1:05:41] they drank they married wives
[1:05:44] they were given in marriage until the
[1:05:46] day that noah entered into the ark and
[1:05:48] the flood came and destroyed them all
[1:05:51] and likewise also as it was in the days
[1:05:53] of lot they did eat they drank they
[1:05:57] bought they sold they planted they build
[1:06:01] it
[1:06:03] but the same day that lot went out of
[1:06:05] sodom it rained fire and brimstone from
[1:06:08] heaven and destroyed them all
[1:06:12] are you with me now let me just say
[1:06:14] isn't a maybe so this is what happened
[1:06:20] are you with me and we live in a nation
[1:06:22] that's it's going to happen
[1:06:25] it's not a maybe so it's going to happen
[1:06:29] but god has prepared a message of escape
[1:06:31] for us
[1:06:34] are you with me and even though shall it
[1:06:36] be in the day when the son of man is
[1:06:39] revealed
[1:06:40] we've had that revealing
[1:06:44] we've had that for gen for for decades
[1:06:47] the ministry of the son of man stood to
[1:06:50] this nation
[1:06:53] and spoke
[1:06:55] this week it just it just it just hit me
[1:06:58] with a thought the only message that
[1:07:01] brother branham preaches that we have
[1:07:04] on video
[1:07:06] to wear that
[1:07:08] that where we could go back and watch
[1:07:10] his mannerisms and the way he preached
[1:07:12] and the way he conducted and the prayer
[1:07:15] lines and we've got tapes but you can
[1:07:17] see it with your eye
[1:07:20] as far as i know it's one of the only
[1:07:22] ones
[1:07:23] is
[1:07:24] is a sermon that is in washington dc
[1:07:27] of all places
[1:07:30] in washington dc and he's standing in a
[1:07:34] in a huge cathedral
[1:07:36] and there he's preaching and he speaks a
[1:07:39] sermon called
[1:07:40] deep
[1:07:41] calleth to the deep.
[1:07:43] [Music]
[1:07:47] and he shows the messiah sign
[1:07:50] to this generation
[1:07:53] politicians there
[1:07:55] men of great renown there
[1:07:58] they
[1:07:59] saw the messiah sign
[1:08:03] god showed this nation
[1:08:05] the messiah sign
[1:08:07] he showed it before the full gospel
[1:08:10] businessman that became a platform to
[1:08:13] which he could gather denominational
[1:08:16] groups to come to a place to where they
[1:08:18] could fellowship together
[1:08:20] and they would boycott the services
[1:08:22] i'm getting ready to go to saskatoon
[1:08:25] the pentecostal and the those movements
[1:08:28] actually
[1:08:29] banned their people from going to the
[1:08:31] meeting
[1:08:33] rented a huge place and brother brandon
[1:08:35] spoke to about 300 people
[1:08:38] but i am understanding that brother
[1:08:40] gunther was there one of the believers
[1:08:42] was there
[1:08:44] god will get his seed
[1:08:48] this isn't to the mass
[1:08:50] populous it will never be politically
[1:08:54] correct
[1:08:56] but i have to say in what we see in this
[1:08:58] sodom generation
[1:09:01] listen if your mind could be straight at
[1:09:03] all
[1:09:04] [Music]
[1:09:06] you could see that it is the bible
[1:09:08] fulfilled in men and women's lives
[1:09:13] good marriages good families good
[1:09:16] children
[1:09:18] that's what this message produces
[1:09:24] not a bunch of
[1:09:26] derelict children or
[1:09:29] let me get on my soapbox just a minute
[1:09:31] this doesn't produce a bunch of divorces
[1:09:34] this doesn't produce a bunch of
[1:09:36] drug-addicted children this this
[1:09:39] produces the life of jesus christ
[1:09:43] [Music]
[1:09:43] [Applause]
[1:09:52] the scripture says in revelations
[1:09:54] chapter 3 and verse 21 to him that
[1:09:57] overcometh
[1:10:00] john is writing on the isle of patmos to
[1:10:02] him that overcometh in this generation
[1:10:05] we're that people
[1:10:08] overcoming means that you're going to
[1:10:10] have to wrestle
[1:10:12] you're going to have to fight to pray
[1:10:15] you're going to have to fight sometimes
[1:10:16] to get past yourself
[1:10:19] the greatest enemy is not your mama your
[1:10:22] daddy your your president
[1:10:25] it's not your pastor
[1:10:29] but we live in such a day
[1:10:31] to where that people want to reject
[1:10:33] headship to the point
[1:10:36] till they they don't they don't want
[1:10:38] statues in the streets
[1:10:41] they don't want no kind of headship to
[1:10:43] tell them what to do
[1:10:45] they don't want god to tell them what to
[1:10:47] do
[1:10:48] they don't want a pastor to tell them
[1:10:50] what to do they don't want a prophet to
[1:10:52] tell them what to do
[1:10:54] but where would we be without god
[1:11:05] where would we be
[1:11:12] where would we be without the message of
[1:11:13] the hour
[1:11:16] we'd be where we was yes
[1:11:20] we'd be where we was
[1:11:22] wrapped up in denominationalism
[1:11:25] don't know how many gods there was how
[1:11:27] to baptize
[1:11:29] no idea about serpency
[1:11:32] no idea about the book of redemption no
[1:11:35] idea about seven seals and seven vials
[1:11:38] and seven trumpets no idea about the
[1:11:41] deity of jesus christ and that same
[1:11:44] deity wants to live inside of you
[1:11:48] this message was not just about william
[1:11:50] branham it was not just about jesus
[1:11:53] christ it's also about you
[1:12:01] hallelujah
[1:12:03] hallelujah
[1:12:04] [Applause]
[1:12:12] god will not come back to get your tape

[1:14:14] could make his way if he would get lost
[1:14:15] he'd never get lost in his own mind
[1:14:18] being an indian in his in his life he
[1:14:20] had a lot of natural instincts
[1:14:22] that that
[1:14:24] that'll that allowed him to do certain
[1:14:26] things you know he talks about walking
[1:14:29] two different ways i've never figured
[1:14:31] out what he's talking about there
[1:14:33] with your legs
[1:14:34] well actually brother donnie and myself
[1:14:36] had a conversation about that don't have
[1:14:38] an idea what brother van was talking
[1:14:39] about but it worked for him but god had
[1:14:43] to allow him
[1:14:45] on his anniversary with his new wife
[1:14:47] taking her up in the mountains
[1:14:50] allow the fog to settle in to such a
[1:14:52] point
[1:14:54] until william marion branham couldn't
[1:14:56] find his way way back to the camp
[1:15:01] now let me just say in your natural life
[1:15:05] there's no accidents with god
[1:15:09] god guides your life and he took you as
[1:15:11] as as as ownership of you to as a
[1:15:15] prisoner
[1:15:16] and he'll watch over your life
[1:15:19] he opens doors and he closes doors
[1:15:24] say it a whole lot with without stopping
[1:15:26] there but let me just say this to you
[1:15:29] god
[1:15:30] knew that william branham needed
[1:15:33] to realize that he needed god to be his
[1:15:38] god
[1:15:38] [Music]
[1:15:43] listen let me just say this you this
[1:15:45] wasn't just for brother branham
[1:15:48] can i just say it and be real clear this
[1:15:51] wasn't just for brother brown
[1:15:54] this wasn't just a good story that
[1:15:56] brother branham is stumbling around and
[1:15:58] he's walking on an indian death walk and
[1:16:01] he knows that his wife is going to be up
[1:16:02] there and freeze to death if he don't
[1:16:04] get back to her and he's getting more
[1:16:06] desperate and more desperate it's not
[1:16:09] just about wigan brown
[1:16:11] you're going to have a path of life and
[1:16:13] there's going to be spots that you're
[1:16:15] going to walk on an indian death walk
[1:16:19] and you're going to walk in a circle and
[1:16:21] you're going to make choices let me just
[1:16:24] say making a bad choice
[1:16:29] every one of us is made up
[1:16:31] but if we can have god to help us with
[1:16:33] our next choice
[1:16:36] and we can ask forgiveness of our sins
[1:16:38] forgiveness of our mistake
[1:16:41] get up and walk straight it's not we
[1:16:43] can't redo anything that we did
[1:16:45] yesterday
[1:16:48] even today but it's your future is what
[1:16:51] we're concerned about
[1:16:53] [Applause]
[1:16:59] it's your future
[1:17:03] god cares about your future
[1:17:06] god cares about your situations
[1:17:09] he deeply cares
[1:17:12] brother ron but i get my heart broken so
[1:17:14] many times god got his heart broke
[1:17:18] brother branham felt rejection david
[1:17:20] felt rejection you're going to feel it
[1:17:23] but god will help you get through it
[1:17:33] we need a god
[1:17:38] god provided for you
[1:17:40] that you'd have a pastor
[1:17:45] well brother ron i only listened to
[1:17:47] tapes brother brandon was my my pastor
[1:17:52] a man told me one time said well brother
[1:17:54] bran is my pastor and i said
[1:17:56] i just listened to tapes and i said
[1:17:57] when's the last time you listened to
[1:17:58] jezebel religion
[1:18:02] he said well why do you ask and i said
[1:18:03] well see how your wife's dressed
[1:18:09] see if you're just listening to tapes
[1:18:10] that are uncomfortable to you
[1:18:15] there's a lot of times you'd like to put
[1:18:17] on the comfort level with me
[1:18:22] but you see god guides our our sermons
[1:18:26] he guides our thoughts
[1:18:28] right to your household to give you
[1:18:30] strength
[1:18:33] he gave you a god called pastor to see
[1:18:35] you through a shepherd that would feed
[1:18:37] you bride
[1:18:38] material that would get you ready for
[1:18:41] the rapture
[1:18:54] hallelujah
[1:18:58] pray for your pastor
[1:19:04] pray for
[1:19:06] strength pray for god to give us
[1:19:09] direction
[1:19:12] you need a man
[1:19:14] that can't be bought
[1:19:19] we had a prophet
[1:19:21] that was offered a million dollar check
[1:19:25] already put it is just needed to know
[1:19:27] where to put it in the account it was
[1:19:28] already written out
[1:19:31] brother biscuit confesses i saw the
[1:19:33] check
[1:19:36] let me just say this to you
[1:19:38] brother branham kind of made a choice
[1:19:40] and did a lot of things with that but he
[1:19:42] did not want to be owed by no man
[1:19:50] are you with me
[1:19:51] so a god in our life
[1:19:54] will not only give us things that we
[1:19:56] need but it'll also prevent us
[1:19:59] from doing things that we shouldn't do
[1:20:05] brother man confess this what would i do
[1:20:07] with a million dollars i i don't even
[1:20:08] know how to act with that kind of money
[1:20:15] you see brother branham was a kind of
[1:20:16] man that could
[1:20:18] could be with dignitaries
[1:20:20] and still be the same
[1:20:22] but he could also go to brother george
[1:20:25] wright's house where hattie wright was
[1:20:27] at and
[1:20:28] and there
[1:20:28] they were pulpers
[1:20:30] and brother branham actually kept him
[1:20:32] alive by taking food to him
[1:20:34] and he could be comfortable with them
[1:20:38] he could be comfortable with the indians
[1:20:39] he could be comfortable in all kinds of
[1:20:41] levels
[1:20:42] but he could also stand in the hall of
[1:20:44] washington
[1:20:45] and speak a sermon called deep calleth
[1:20:47] to the deep
[1:20:49] i've taken you on a little tour there
[1:20:58] the guide
[1:20:59] was more than just in the woods
[1:21:05] but god guided him when a million
[1:21:06] dollars was offered
[1:21:10] then he he had to be molded to the place
[1:21:12] that he could trust him
[1:21:14] with the church ages
[1:21:19] and the seven seals
[1:21:22] he could gather up all the loose ends
[1:21:25] from all of the preachers all down
[1:21:28] through
[1:21:28] the ages
[1:21:30] many of them preaching phenomenal truths
[1:21:33] but didn't know what to do with it
[1:21:35] and you ask well well feni preached that
[1:21:38] or or larkin preached that but let me
[1:21:41] just say many of them discovered truths
[1:21:44] but they were kind of like benjamin
[1:21:47] franklin that discovered electricity
[1:21:50] he got it
[1:21:53] but now what do i do with it
[1:21:56] a man named addison came along and he
[1:21:59] brought that electricity thank god he
[1:22:01] brought that electricity down to where
[1:22:04] that we could use it and we turn on the
[1:22:06] lights
[1:22:09] men had truth all down through the ages
[1:22:12] but they didn't know what to do with it
[1:22:14] martin luther the just shall live by
[1:22:17] faith
[1:22:19] but we come to the seals and brother
[1:22:20] branham would say the justification was
[1:22:23] this though you never did it in the
[1:22:26] first place
[1:22:35] for martin luther that was getting him
[1:22:38] away from a powerful catholic church
[1:22:41] with its dictatorship and rulership but
[1:22:45] there could be christians
[1:22:47] that could live by the faith of the
[1:22:49] truth of the gospel and they could have
[1:22:51] a bible
[1:22:54] in their own language
[1:22:57] in their own home
[1:22:59] it wasn't just for a pope it wasn't just
[1:23:02] for priests
[1:23:04] this bible that you carried in tonight
[1:23:07] has cost men
[1:23:09] their lives
[1:23:12] [Applause]
[1:23:13] don't ever take it for granted
[1:23:31] matthew 25 and verse 1.
[1:23:35] now here's jesus speaking now he's going
[1:23:36] to speak of you again
[1:23:39] then shall the kingdom of heaven be
[1:23:41] likened unto
[1:23:43] ten virgins
[1:23:45] which took their lamps
[1:23:48] and went forth to meet the bridegroom
[1:23:52] where do you get rapture in the
[1:23:53] scripture right here's a good spot
[1:23:57] five of them were wise
[1:24:00] five of them were foolish
[1:24:04] they that were foolish took their lamps
[1:24:06] and took no all with them
[1:24:08] that's the holy ghost
[1:24:11] the all
[1:24:12] is the holy ghost
[1:24:16] the holy ghost is the seal
[1:24:19] the guide
[1:24:20] the seal on your life
[1:24:23] that god has a that god has placed you
[1:24:27] he's you're worthy of the journey
[1:24:31] you're the temple to where god wants to
[1:24:33] live in
[1:24:35] for those that may be sitting here
[1:24:36] tonight that don't have that holy ghost
[1:24:38] living in your life don't stop praying
[1:24:41] for it
[1:24:44] don't come to a spot where you sit in a
[1:24:46] pew and just become satisfied
[1:24:49] you make sure
[1:24:52] that you pray and pray and pray and let
[1:24:55] me just say if you've got it you still
[1:24:56] pray for more of it
[1:24:59] there's not a day i don't pray for more
[1:25:02] of the life of jesus christ to live on
[1:25:05] the inside of me if not we become
[1:25:08] stagnant backslidden christians
[1:25:12] resting on our laurels and become
[1:25:14] complacent
[1:25:16] and it becomes commonplace to come to
[1:25:18] church sit down and be entertained we
[1:25:20] want a fervent desire in our hearts
[1:25:24] [Applause]
[1:25:25] a perfect desire
[1:25:27] a passion to serve god
[1:25:30] like never before
[1:25:33] may our campfires
[1:25:35] may our lamp burn
[1:25:40] trim the drops off of your life trim the
[1:25:43] dead parts off of your life let the holy
[1:25:46] ghost live
[1:25:48] let it live like never before inside of
[1:25:51] our lives
[1:25:58] hallelujah
[1:26:00] you don't want me to be honest many
[1:26:02] times
[1:26:03] congregations don't want me to be honest
[1:26:06] i see too many people that start getting
[1:26:08] great-headed and getting backslidded at
[1:26:11] the same time
[1:26:12] because they become complacent
[1:26:16] they feel like it's just they're
[1:26:17] entitled to it
[1:26:20] you've got to fight every day of this
[1:26:22] journey
[1:26:23] you've got to press your way don't take
[1:26:26] a day off
[1:26:27] [Applause]
[1:26:30] press
[1:26:42] we're destined to fulfill
[1:26:44] i think sometimes we need to shake
[1:26:46] ourselves a little bit
[1:26:51] we just shake ourselves a little bit
[1:26:53] god's among us
[1:26:55] and i'm afraid too many times if i could
[1:26:57] i could grab you
[1:26:59] spiritually i'm pastored now tonight if
[1:27:01] i could spiritually grab you and say
[1:27:04] wake up
[1:27:06] wake up the bride's revival is on

[1:27:45] singing groups come here

[1:27:49] here
[1:27:51] the bride has the best singers in the
[1:27:53] world there's no need in entertaining
[1:27:54] herself with laodicea
[1:28:01] we've got phenomenal singers
[1:28:03] but we've got some of the greatest
[1:28:04] preaching that's ever been standing in
[1:28:06] shoe level and i'm not talking about
[1:28:08] myself
[1:28:10] but god has given this bride the
[1:28:12] greatest men standing in human flesh
[1:28:18] we are without excuse
[1:28:21] [Music]
[1:28:30] that goes for the people on the internet

[1:29:15] [Applause]
[1:29:22] we're not careful we'll come to a spot
[1:29:25] even with the message it'll be an
[1:29:26] entertainment it'll be no more than i
[1:29:28] love susie
[1:29:37] and andy griffith had some incredible
[1:29:40] morals
[1:29:42] it was a wonderful show
[1:29:45] but there's no eternal life in that
[1:29:50] there's things that all of us like
[1:29:53] but there's no eternal life in it
[1:29:56] don't put nothing ahead of god
[1:30:01] because we're destined to fulfill
[1:30:10] i'm going to use this in the morning and
[1:30:12] i may come back to it in the morning
[1:30:14] is it all right if i say it twice
[1:30:20] there's a rich young ruler who came to
[1:30:21] jesus
[1:30:23] and he had performed it it performed the
[1:30:25] law to the letter
[1:30:28] all of his life
[1:30:32] all of his life
[1:30:34] he was diligent he was committed
[1:30:38] but he still likes something
[1:30:40] in brother branham's last sermon he
[1:30:43] addresses this rich young ruler again
[1:30:48] and he explains that jesus loved him
[1:30:52] he explains that this boy there was
[1:30:55] something drawing on him to come to the
[1:30:58] right spot
[1:31:00] to come to the leader to come to the
[1:31:02] messiah
[1:31:03] something brought him to that spot
[1:31:06] and jesus loved him
[1:31:14] and when jesus looked at him he saw
[1:31:16] something that he lacked
[1:31:20] and he told him he said
[1:31:23] go sell all you have
[1:31:26] and give it to the poor
[1:31:34] that don't mean millionaires today have
[1:31:35] to do that
[1:31:37] but he gives you responsibility of what
[1:31:38] to do with it
[1:31:41] but here was a rich young ruler
[1:31:44] that he turned away
[1:31:49] sorrowful
[1:31:51] because he couldn't
[1:31:53] make that step
[1:31:57] jesus asked him too much
[1:32:06] you know god wouldn't do that without
[1:32:10] without having an example before him
[1:32:14] that did forsake it all
[1:32:18] maybe you've never put this
[1:32:20] together
[1:32:22] but there was another rich young ruler
[1:32:25] that looked out our window
[1:32:27] and realized that those people that were
[1:32:30] out there
[1:32:33] were god's kids
[1:32:36] and he was one of them
[1:32:41] and he realized that
[1:32:43] he was a part of them
[1:32:45] his bloodline was not egypt
[1:32:48] but it was the children of israel
[1:32:51] and he realized
[1:32:53] i'm identified with that children of
[1:32:56] israel that's where the covenant is
[1:33:00] oh hallelujah let me preach this and
[1:33:03] just end it here tonight let me just say
[1:33:04] this to you if you can look where your
[1:33:07] origin comes from
[1:33:10] i came from god and i'm going back to
[1:33:12] god
[1:33:14] i don't want nothing
[1:33:15] nothing to keep me from my destiny
[1:33:19] [Applause]
[1:33:28] he forsook riches
[1:33:33] moses rolls off of our tongue but you
[1:33:36] don't know the cost of that ministry
[1:33:39] how many people waited on him daily took
[1:33:42] care of his every need and he said i
[1:33:45] don't need that no more
[1:33:47] i'm willing to live like a vagabond
[1:33:50] [Music]
[1:33:51] he forsake fame
[1:33:56] he forsook power
[1:34:02] because he wasn't ashamed
[1:34:04] of god
[1:34:09] there's not a doubt in this mind our
[1:34:11] minds today are where moses's destiny is
[1:34:26] so there's two rich young rulers
[1:34:28] one made a phenomenal
[1:34:30] incredible
[1:34:32] decision
[1:34:34] and what did it result in
[1:34:39] the saving of an entire generation
[1:34:45] of israel
[1:34:48] that had been slaves
[1:34:52] but god had to send him through 40 years
[1:34:54] in a desert to get him ready to be a
[1:34:56] prophet
[1:35:01] what did the results of the decision of
[1:35:03] the rich young ruler
[1:35:06] all we know is is jesus has another
[1:35:08] story that he tells
[1:35:10] a rich man in hell
[1:35:14] nobody could tell that like brother
[1:35:15] homer
[1:35:19] brother homer one day we were in walmart
[1:35:24] we picked up milk
[1:35:27] we were walking back by the freezer
[1:35:29] counter brother homer when you were with
[1:35:31] him at any moment you could get a sermon
[1:35:36] and he turned at the freezer counter and
[1:35:38] he turned around to me and he said
[1:35:41] just think about that rich man in hell
[1:35:48] he said the man that owns walmart
[1:35:51] he said he owns walmarts all across
[1:35:52] america
[1:35:54] but what will that mean in hell
[1:36:00] he had an opportunity with jesus
[1:36:02] but now after he goes to hell
[1:36:05] he becomes religious
[1:36:09] he becomes religious
[1:36:19] brother jason's going to get married
[1:36:21] here in a few weeks
[1:36:22] [Music]
[1:36:23] and
[1:36:25] and he'll understand why i'm saying
[1:36:26] these things
[1:36:28] so many people in jail
[1:36:30] get religious
[1:36:32] is that right
[1:36:34] they get religious have church
[1:36:36] do all phenomenal things
[1:36:38] they become religious immediately
[1:36:43] and it's easy to live in the confines
[1:36:46] of a system that keeps you
[1:36:54] well what makes brother jason's story
[1:36:57] is this okay
[1:36:59] makes your destiny different
[1:37:03] are you with me now
[1:37:04] is he has identified himself
[1:37:07] and he was writing me letters about a
[1:37:09] year before getting out
[1:37:12] i realized where i'm at i've got all
[1:37:14] those letters
[1:37:15] and i would respond back and i'd send
[1:37:17] him pages of brother brandon's books
[1:37:19] didn't know what i could do
[1:37:21] and here he comes to church
[1:37:24] listen we're not even concerned with
[1:37:26] this past
[1:37:30] [Applause]
[1:37:41] let me just say i've been guarded by
[1:37:43] deacons that were a whole lot worse than
[1:37:45] him
[1:37:47] go to places

[1:38:54] with a family
[1:38:56] god was on his trail
[1:38:59] he was on his trail

[1:39:05] seed inside of you that he's after

[1:46:09] how that she was an illegitimate child
[1:46:12] and how that she had washed so many
[1:46:14] dishes and her mother
[1:46:16] in an insane institution
[1:46:18] and she had longed
[1:46:21] while she was the most
[1:46:23] perfect bodied woman

[1:50:25] around the world and i've been around
[1:50:26] the world and saw her hanging
[1:50:30] men still lasting for her
[1:50:33] and a prophet of god would bring her up
[1:50:35] the most beautiful woman most beautiful
[1:50:37] bodied woman

[1:51:03] here

[1:51:18] i'm gonna marry a man and it's going to
[1:51:20] fix my let me just say if you're not
[1:51:22] complete within yourself with jesus
[1:51:25] marrying a man that's uncommitted to
[1:51:27] jesus
[1:51:28] you'll never fix him
[1:51:30] because you couldn't fix yourself
[1:51:34] jesus knows what you need
[1:51:53] jesus talked more about hell
[1:51:56] than he talked about heaven
[1:52:01] i don't know if you've read that much of
[1:52:02] it but
[1:52:03] jesus talks more about hell
[1:52:06] then he talks about heaven
[1:52:09] a lot of people want to spiritualize
[1:52:11] that today that said this is this is the
[1:52:13] only hell that you'll ever be in
[1:52:26] there's too many people that's died that
[1:52:28] was lost
[1:52:30] that the testimony was
[1:52:32] their last breath said
[1:52:34] one one great leader i'm not gonna call
[1:52:36] his name but said i never believed in
[1:52:38] hell until now
[1:52:41] and they've come to get me
[1:52:44] when i take my last breath
[1:52:48] i want it to be a friendly place
[1:53:00] don't waste your life for ashes
[1:53:07] what will i be when i grow up
[1:53:10] i was six years old
[1:53:13] and i drawed from mrs earls
[1:53:15] that i was going to be an astronaut
[1:53:20] she didn't understand it but i drawn a
[1:53:23] picture it was black all over the page i
[1:53:26] spent the whole hour in class
[1:53:28] drawing blackness
[1:53:31] in the middle of it
[1:53:32] i drawed a little white light
[1:53:37] and that was me
[1:53:41] i never told you they'd have a connie
[1:53:45] and she asked me she said what is that i
[1:53:46] said
[1:53:47] i'm an astronaut
[1:53:50] you see i'd heard in a sermon
[1:53:52] that the world is black
[1:53:54] but god put a place inside of me about
[1:53:56] the size of a button
[1:54:03] and that button that size of that button
[1:54:06] had power
[1:54:07] to create a world
[1:54:10] and i could go live a life on it
[1:54:14] i'm 60 years old and i didn't have to
[1:54:16] wait till i was 60
[1:54:18] to believe this message
[1:54:22] i was six years old
[1:54:25] and believed it
[1:54:27] with all my heart
[1:54:29] i made a lot of bad decisions between 6
[1:54:33] and 23.
[1:54:36] but god was so rich in mercy
[1:54:40] that my destiny never changed
[1:54:44] [Applause]
[1:54:59] you see i have been
[1:55:01] discerning
[1:55:02] as the service went on today
[1:55:06] we didn't have a prayer line
[1:55:08] but you had a discernment line
[1:55:12] and some of you are worried about what's
[1:55:13] going to happen next week next month
[1:55:15] next year what am i going to do with my
[1:55:17] life
[1:55:22] what's what's going to happen in my
[1:55:23] situation
[1:55:25] you know it don't matter what the doctor
[1:55:27] diagnosis
[1:55:31] i'm going to go wednesday and dr gone
[1:55:33] could give me the worst report i've ever
[1:55:35] had
[1:55:36] i'm not expecting that
[1:55:38] but it's not going to shape me
[1:55:41] on thursday i'm going to get on a plane
[1:55:43] and go preach the unreachable the
[1:55:45] unsearchable riches of jesus christ
[1:55:48] with the same faith i stand here tonight
[1:55:50] with
[1:55:51] regardless of what the report says
[1:55:55] are you with me
[1:55:57] don't let temporary things cloud over
[1:56:00] eternal matters
[1:56:04] but my car my home the economic
[1:56:07] situation uh the the president let me
[1:56:10] just say you can't fix none of that
[1:56:15] you can't fix none of that you can stand
[1:56:17] and put signs walk up and down the
[1:56:19] streets with signs you can't fix that
[1:56:22] that's this world
[1:56:24] i'm concerned about another world
[1:56:32] this world is not my home
[1:56:37] i'm just passing through
[1:56:44] abraham was in a
[1:56:46] very nomad type situation
[1:56:50] didn't really have a home
[1:56:52] just moving as the tent moved
[1:56:54] god moved him
[1:56:56] but he was citizen of another kingdom
[1:56:59] he had met the king
[1:57:02] and one day he met him
[1:57:06] when he met him he changed his life
[1:57:09] and that change produced a child
[1:57:13] then that child produced another child
[1:57:16] and then that child produced 12 tribes
[1:57:21] and moses as a prophet of god
[1:57:23] a rich young ruler
[1:57:29] that rich young ruler said
[1:57:32] i'll take the way with the despised few
[1:57:41] i realized a long time ago
[1:57:43] i might be the only one in my family
[1:57:46] i might be the only one in my job
[1:57:47] situation
[1:57:49] i might be the only one in my school
[1:57:51] i might be the only one in the state
[1:57:56] but i'm going to keep my eyes on jesus
[1:58:04] that's what i want to keep my eyes on
[1:58:08] i hope part one was okay here
[1:58:24] there's a song said i'll stand for jesus
[1:58:26] and let the world go by
[1:58:28] sister cassie won't you come
[1:58:31] amen amen
[1:58:35] brother jason sister
[1:58:37] is it melissa
[1:58:39] yeah if i call it wrong you just forgive
[1:58:41] me
[1:58:42] i'd like for you guys to come i i won't
[1:58:44] be there to do your wedding but i want
[1:58:46] to i want to pray for you
[1:58:48] maybe the different way to end a service
[1:58:50] but i want to pray for this couple
[1:58:57] i watch her as she
[1:58:59] listens to me preach
[1:59:01] when she first came she was
[1:59:03] kind of set like a mannequin almost
[1:59:04] scared of me i think
[1:59:07] [Music]
[1:59:08] and i've watched how you responded to
[1:59:10] the word
[1:59:13] the word changes our lives
[1:59:15] i'm so proud of you
[1:59:17] i'm so proud of you
[1:59:19] you see god don't need to know history
[1:59:21] he knows all of that
[1:59:23] but he said i'll take care of your
[1:59:24] future if you put my she'll take me by
[1:59:26] the hand
[1:59:28] you remember
[1:59:31] he he asked peter he says
[1:59:34] don't you come walk with me
[1:59:38] sometimes in walking with jesus it's a
[1:59:39] little little dangerous
[1:59:41] because walking with jesus you got gotta
[1:59:43] get out of a boat
[1:59:45] leave the security
[1:59:47] leave what you know
[1:59:50] and step on the water
[1:59:52] and as long as he had his eyes on jesus
[1:59:55] everything worked out really well but
[1:59:58] where we get in trouble is we get our
[1:59:59] eyes off of jesus
[2:00:02] and we'll begin to drown now that story
[2:00:04] was not just for peter it's also for us
[2:00:09] you remember a little just a little
[2:00:11] while ago i was telling you about
[2:00:12] brother branham being a god but it was
[2:00:14] more than about brother branham and it
[2:00:16] was more about peter getting out of the
[2:00:18] boat
[2:00:18] it's about us as well
[2:00:20] could we stand as an audience and
[2:00:22] i know you're proud today
[2:00:24] to have these guys with us
[2:00:27] amen as you go into this season
[2:00:30] i i i just i'm sorry i can't be there
[2:00:33] but andrew will do a great job for you
[2:00:34] you know that by now
[2:00:36] amen
[2:00:38] amen i'd like to take both of your hands
[2:00:39] lord jesus
[2:00:44] oh i thank you for the grace of god
[2:00:46] [Music]
[2:00:47] i thank you for your extreme mercy and
[2:00:50] your kindness
[2:00:52] to watch over our lives
[2:00:56] in so many dark times
[2:00:58] in so many bad situations
