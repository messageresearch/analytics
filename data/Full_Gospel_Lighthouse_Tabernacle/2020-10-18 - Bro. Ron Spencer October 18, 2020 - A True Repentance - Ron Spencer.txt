was getting stronger [Applause] the pool i found was more than i could bear [Music] but i was on the verge of giving over the strength within myself just wasn't there but something keeps holding me we're gonna sing it but something keeps holding me oh every day i see he's helping me faithfully to overcome my trials he's guiding me constantly or giving me victory oh it's a reality that something keeps holding me now satan lay before me his temptation and his desire to steal away my faith but i have found in time the revelation the strength i need to keep me in his grace yes something keeps holding me every day i see he's helping me faithfully to overcome my trials he's guiding me constantly oh giving victory oh he's a reality cause something keeps holding me jesus is holding me every day i see he's helping me faithfully to overcome my trials for guiding me constantly o giving me victory oh he's a reality well something keeps holding me hallelujah that's enough to have a revival on right there amen when i can't hold myself he's got my hand how many ever feels like it i can't hold me i i just i've done all i can do i'm overwhelmed and then all of a sudden he goes i got you i got you good to see you in the house of the lord and uh we certainly love you with all of our hearts and you know this enemy has did everything in the world to shut churches down and the nfl down and politics down and and you still keep showing up and so we're just so thankful for that brother meadows we're so glad to see you here amen he's been through quite a war and it's weakened him a bit but we're so glad to have him him here amen each and every one of you we're so glad to see you in the house of the lord frankie glad to see you we have friends back here and i'm going to i'm going to catch your name today sitting right in front of brother ray can you just your names paul paul ann okay ushani kushani is that am i saying that right yes well we're glad to have you they came in on one of the skeleton meetings and and it was about 10 or 12 of us here and they came into the back and they came and i hope you didn't feel like you got the whole load that day but amen what a wonderful service that was and that was the service where i went and sat with andrew and we had a conversation and it was a special service we certainly love the lord with all of our hearts we love you and we're going to get through this we're going to get through it we're going to make it god god's with us he's determined to be with us he's not he's not at all shy about it i just sometimes in my mind i wonder is this kind of a prenuptial of the rapture to where that the local bodies are so scattered until and the the world is so scattered until when the rapture happens and people just start saying hey that that group of people's gone we got a lot of other things happening amen and so you know i i think you know someone asked me this week said it does it test our faith well remember jesus said when i return shall i find faith and i believe that there's a people on the earth that are just steady as jigos amen we love you with all of our hearts and i thought andrew preached one of his best sermons last night and it was just so great amen always loved to hear where i came from because that tells me where i'm going amen amen god bless you if you will turn with me in your scriptures this morning to john john chapter 3 john chapter 3 and verse 1. and i'll try andrew andrew just did such an awesome job last night i i just so thank the lord for that amen amen i had a very sick night last night you don't need to hear that but it might help you to pray for me this morning so and so we're if ever i'm preaching and all of a sudden i disappear you just keep right on going and andrew you do like jason you just keep preaching amen amen so we love the lord we're going to win we're going to win i want to speak this morning on a on a true repentance amen hallelujah the lord just kept has kept pulling me back in this direction so i i just feel like that the enemy is in some real trouble this morning amen there was a man of the pharisees named nicodemus a ruler of the jews the same came to jesus by night and said unto him rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from god for no man can do these miracles that thou doest except god be with him and that's an incredible scripture right there that's an incredible scripture and jesus answered and said unto him verily verily i say unto you except a man be born again now think about these things now he cannot see the kingdom of god this is jesus's first teachings nicodemus saith unto him how can a man be born be born when he is old and can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born and jesus answered verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born of water and of spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god that which which is born of flesh is flesh that which is born of the spirit is spirit marvel not that i say unto thee ye must be born again the wind bloweth where it listeth then thou hearest the sound thereof but canest thou not not tell whence it cometh or whether it goeth so is it that is born of the spirit of the spirit nicodemus answered and said unto him how can these things be and jesus answered and said unto him art thou a master of israel and know us not these things verily verbally i say unto you we speak that which we do know and testify that which we have seen and ye receive not our witness if i have told you earthly things and ye believe not how shall ye believe if i tell you heavenly things phenomenal and no man hath ascended up into heaven but he that that came down from heaven even the son of man which is in heaven and as moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so the son of man be lifted up and whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life and this is on billboard's cars everywhere in the world for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life don't stop there for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved and he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already when the word is presented to you your response to the word tells you where you are because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god and this is the condemnation that light has come into the world and men love darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil you may be seated this morning god bless the reading of his word so good to see you you've heard this story many times here's some time ago they had the religions of the world to meet he said i was reading in the book the other day of this lady macabee from oklahoma here that's arrested out here that might have been in in tulsa or one of these places she was running through the streets driving stage coaches and smoking a cigar that kind of tells you where she was at in in that time period of life breaking the speed limits with a stage coach i'd say this is a moody story and all the religions and different religions raised up and told they're part of the religion how great it was and the muhammad priest told how great his religion was and and the buddha told how great his religion was a certain little minister i i can't call his name now brother bran would say was representing the religion of america christian religion and when he got his name his time to the platform he told the story of of this great foul woman and how low that she was still until they couldn't didn't even want to get around her even to get close enough to tar and feather her she was so immoral she was degraded and there was nothing that could could help her and then he said gentlemen religions of this world can your religions produce anything that would cleanse the hands of this vile person everybody just sit real still right on the end of their streets no one said nothing then he jumped up in the air and screamed and kicked his heels together he said the blood of jesus christ won't only cleanse her hands but it'll cleanse her heart and make her pure as a lily the blood of jesus christ takes away sin and cleanses us from all of our iniquity and makes us new creatures in christ jesus nothing else would do it i want to report to you this blood cleansed my life and i'm a living testimony to it i found this the other day and i just i just really liked it says from time to time i have i've had people pour out their hearts to me because their sins had been discovered and they were in serious trouble they wept bitterly because they had devastated their marriage and ruined their reputation but later would tell you that they were back in the same situation they had not learned from their original experience and seemed determined to bring even more chaos into their life you ever met some of these kind of people you're welcome to say amen what was the problem the problem was the lack of repentance their tears were tears of self-pity not tears of repentance true repentance is turning from sin a conscious deliberate decision to leave sin behind and a conscious turning to god with a commitment to follow follow his will repentance is only one part of our response to christ even repentance is strength from god even repentance is strength from god but it's an essential part for without it we cannot claim christ as our lord the bible said godly sorrows brings repentance and that leads to salvation and leaves no regrets now here's where i want to just drop this just for a moment and i thought this is what caught my attention are you living in regret or repentance are you living in regret or repentance to turn away from our sins is not is just not enough we must also now turn toward god only he can create a new heart within us and give us strength to live differently brother brahman says and from that time he said all these things are there's a time when when something happens maybe all of your their vows and the league of nations and maybe had good intentions but they all have to come to an end all become crumbling beneath the feet of men with all the good intentions we have but all must come to an end there is a time that where a man can come to something that's eternal that when a man it's a time for a man to meet god and that's when something happens eternal we do our mistakes we make our vows on new year's night only to break them the next day we turn new pages we assign new vows we go to a priest we make confessions we sign pledges we we come to the altar and turn new pages but all were in vain all of that was in vain for the next time someone somebody crosses our path or something that old temper will fly right back up every time that we get into trouble or something it'll just happen again but there is a place help me preach there is a place when a man can come to the time that it will change forever [Music] we we he that will come to me i will in no wise cast him out said jesus a man can come to god and his whole eternal destination has changed a man can meet god and he will never be the same anymore let me just say this to you if you truly meet jesus not a theory not sitting in a church pew but if you truly meet jesus you will never be the same hallelujah well brother ron i i met i met a value of a of a historical story i'm not talking about that anybody can read can get that they can make a mental intellectual birth and and and hang on to that but if you ever meet jesus himself of this day your life will be changed are you with me now you can't be meet god and ever be the same person that you was if you turn away from him you'll be worse than you ever was if you receive him you've got eternal life and he will raise you up at the last days i believe that with all my heart he said when you see the real true principles of the gospel of the lord jesus christ when you see our foundation is sure and solid all the devils out of hell can't upset that foundation hallelujah when you get solid there's nothing the devil can do to shake you i believe there's a place you can come in jesus christ to where it is a saddle fixed situation for a character are you with me now now let me just say this to you you and i have been here for decades we've been christians for decades what was the difference between your experience and the person that may have set the pubic side of you walking to the same altar and yet they're like a yo-yo they're back and forward they don't know where they're in church or out of church they can't seem to break the cycle or the chains of their original dna they're constantly going backwards and forwards and and constantly got excuses i'm going to preach to you today it's going to be a real bad day for the devil but if you truly repent [Applause] and you truly receive a sanctification and a true baptism of the holy ghost there's no going back you know you don't have to convince yourself do i go to church it's just what you do i didn't get up this morning sister tara and go now breathe ron breathe now breathe now breathe but there was a time in my life when i was coming off a ventilator machine after after about three to four weeks and there was a nurse in my ear she said fight to live fight to live fight to live and she was screaming you've got to fight to live and she was screaming my ear run fight to live i think that's what ought to be some of our altar experiences fight to die out to this world fight to die out to this world satan you don't have dominion over me no more i'm not gonna be your slave hallelujah now watch as he said when a man a prisoner maybe was under the taskmaster of of the time of the jubilee and he worked under that taskmaster and then when that final year come of the jubilee then when the priest sounded the trumpet no matter what he was doing if he was in the field hoeing and the jubilee sounded then he could drop that hope and say to the slave driver you have no more jurisdiction over me i'm going home to my wife and babies now if they could say that under the old testament under that law jesus was our jubilee i don't care what your history was this morning so many people want to give you a history lesson over their lives i don't need it jesus washed it completely away it has no more dominion over you anymore [Applause] or to be shouting at this church this morning it's not what i was it's what i am now i'm not that man no longer i'm not under that dominion i'm not married to that husband no longer first nature you have no control over top of my life [Applause] i am married to christ am i too loud brother branham says he says now you become a new person not just the old one patched up owen patched up by joining a church trying to turn over a new page new page but you become a brand new unit what happened to that guy he was this way last week and he went to church this week give him some time just give him some time give him six months give him a year just let some trials come and you watch them year by year just get stronger and stronger and stronger because you realize it wasn't a man that was holding on it wasn't the personality of a preacher but it was jesus himself now let's just think of this as a marriage now i'm i'm getting them some skating on some difficult territory here just for a minute but let's just think of marrying jesus now we're together we've got a love relationship it would be wrong for you if you're his wife to constantly bring up your first husband well this is how much fun that i had in the in the first with the first husband listen your first husband was your own nature and your choices under your first husband only took you further from god are you with me there were egyptians that wanted there were there were israelites that wanted to go back to egypt and they constantly said we had it better under those taskmasters you noticed they didn't go in the new world they didn't go in the promised land i've got my eyes focused on the rapture [Music] listen i don't want to just produce a church entity [Applause] we're not here to produce baptist though they're good people presbyterian though they're good people we're not here to produce another denomination this is not a halfway house for sinners this is a transformation center where you come as a sin up but you don't come and stay a sinner [Applause] and listen you have a right this morning to revoke the jurisdiction of satan over your life and maybe you've sat here for years and satan has hounded you and haunted you with your past tell him that this power of this blood has revoked all of that and he washed away every sin true repentance is to turn away from it true repentance is to say it's over you know in the old testament men of incredible faith of incredible power of incredible position desired to live in a body that match what god's word would say they desired not just to go and offer a sacrifice but they would no longer fight lust imagine it was difficult for moses to write about being a murderer abraham to write about being a liar and then his son isaac to repeat the process again you see sometimes if you're not careful you'll repeat your father's and your mother's sin brother ron why does this need to be preached in the message church if we're not careful we'll produce a bunch of rotten eggs and you're patting rotten eggs all the time trying to get them in rapturing condition and let me let me just let me just give you a little clue here you'll never make a go to sheep though there's use for goats you'll never make him a sheep and the difference between sheep and goat is sheep will automatically produce wool they eat it gets this time of year and their hair just grows many years ago when sister stephanie and your sister she here there she is they came in there was a few others that came in and forgive me i'm trying to find so about six of you came in about the same time cheerleaders they were coming right out of high school didn't have a clue about the message and i'm talking about from every every different walk and i'm their pastor and i'm watching them come in i refuse to preach dress code for six months i refuse to preach i refused to preach on those things for about six months because i wanted to watch god change them because so many times ministers feel like i'm the one to change in them and we've got very little to do with it are you with me you don't have to beat life into someone just create an atmosphere [Applause] an atmosphere of real repentance brother donnie you could probably count on your life how many times you tried to make a run you tried to serve the lord and you would just kind of be bob but there was a time there was a time to where it just changed and it was over and there was no going back and it had consequences it had consequences because let me just say sometimes when you serve god your friends don't want no part of it can we all say that are you with me sometimes our highways change gabriel i'd like for you to stand just now i know you're getting ready to leave in a minute to go work by the way god did a work for gabriel last night for those that's on the internet come gabriel let's let's just do that let's do this because we've got a couple thousand people that don't have a clue who you are you don't you don't need that just now i need him to see you i'm not scared of you live with me this is my brother's boy and this is a young man that came the day before i was going to have brain surgery and we were sitting in the room and the room was full that was before covid the room was full and he had came and one of the most odd things happened was i was in the bed and gabriel was there and gabriel he and i you know we've always been buddies but you know we've had an attachment and so gabriel was just sitting there and i knew something was up i was watching for it and i actually just said a prayer lord let the room empty out to where i can deal with him and about 15 minutes the room emptied out and he changed it don't take 14 years it don't take it it don't take it don't take a deal to where that you just belly out some way another just in just a few moments he just changed because jesus came in the room he just changed brother bill you was praying with me that night at the piano many years ago in 1983 and i changed god came on the scene and i just changed you remember those days in a moment he came and gets changed you couldn't change yourself but he changed you can't explain it but he changed last night gabriel was working and he pulled over a boy you never know who you're pulling over he pulled over a man i'm just gonna if i don't do well you just tell me and i and he pulls over the boy and god just arranged it to where he he looks at this stop as a complete different stop and he does things that he's never done before and instead of walking on this side he walks on that side he has his identification he's a felon the girl's a felon and when they come back up he comes back up the man has a gun under his leg and he's getting ready to use it on gabriel and gabriel stops it i'll tell you who stopped that [Applause] [Music] the difference between life and death say well brother ron i i don't get much out of serving the lord how many months had been since the brain surgery four months six six six months glory to god glory to god they found out i had a brain and he can say god spared my life this morning that's right this church could be under the gloom of another death at the hands of an enemy but god spared his life god bless you brother [Music] here's where i want to go with that and i wasn't going to do it while i'm standing here he was a different guy six months ago he was an egotistical it was all about him life was free as a breeze and he was moving from this station of life to that station of life and he could find no foundation but in a 15-minute window in a 15-minute window it changed hallelujah hallelujah what's burning your heart this morning i'm afraid too many people have said in church i'm not just talking about here i'm talking about in all the places that i've preached in my life and that's been a few and people are just going like like the mount horeb they're just going in the same cycle over and over and over again two years that go good and then they're out of church for two years and then they go good and then they're out of church for two years i tell you sin still got control but it don't have to stay that way hallelujah it don't have to stay that way brother ron i'm trying to break this habit and this habit and this habit and this habit there's where you got it wrong you're trying you're trying light and darkness can't dwell together can i just say it like this i read scriptures i read scriptures i read scriptures like this and even as they did not like to to retain god in their knowledge god gave them over to reprobate mine to do those things that's which are not convenient being filled with all unrighteousness and fornication and wickedness and covenants and maliciousness full of envy and murder and debate and receipt and deceit and malignity and whispers whisperers backbiters haters of god despiteful proud boasters inventors of evil things disobedient to parents and without understanding covenant breakers and without natural affection impossible you meet people like this every day [Applause] unmerciful who knowing the judgment of god that they which commit such things or are worthy of death not only to do the same but have pleasure in them that do it and we live in a laodicean age where do whatever you want to do lawless society where would we be without police officers let me get political here just for a minute you want to get rid of those guys you better hire yourself private security if you own anything are you with me listen if we get rid of police officers i'm going to have to put guards down here at this gate with machine guns but because we got four or five police officers that are not skinny winnie the silly jellyfish backbone men penny waste [Music] come on church but we have a society that wants to get rid of everything in authority yes it made me mad when they turned when they tore teddy roosevelt down this week yes five foot five mad from them from here to there but let me just say this you they are tying more than teddy roosevelt down they tore him down this down in washington a long time ago when it's no longer welcome we live in a nation that refuses to repent [Applause] but there will be a rapture there will be a people that will make a rapture that know what true repentance is all about we're no longer what we used to be that is over i've told you the story before of a friend of mine that came to my place to to spend some time with me and he wanted to tell me about talk to me about the old times he was a good friend as a as a boy he was good friend got me in a lot of trouble but he was a good friend i probably got him in a lot of trouble probably that way better more than it was the other way but my boys were about 18 to 20. and they were sitting there and they were listening to a conversation and i had prepped them i said eddie don't know me as a as a christian he has missed the last 25 years of my life and he don't know this ron he don't know this guy he knows somebody else can i use that to preach just for a couple minutes and when he came in and he sat down and we began to rehearse a few things and then immediately he went down 10-10 alley i just let him go and he just went and he went and he went and he could see that you know his energies was wearing out because i wasn't reciprocating a whole lot and then you know i figured he had driven about three hours to see me and he needed to get his three hours worth and i told him i said eddie i i want to tell you something the man you're talking about don't live here now i look like that guy but i'm not that guy i'm i'm not him anymore this looks like the address to the old home and that guy that you're talking about he died he died he died in 1983. now he died and we had a funeral for him we buried him in watery baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ and i raised to walk a newness of love i didn't have to have alcoholics anonymous i didn't have to have a rehab center i didn't have to go to some psychologist someone another i met jesus [Applause] and when jesus came into my life all of the habits died off because light and darkness can't dwell together [Applause] are you with me now let me just say this you heaven is not going to be a home full of drunkards dopatics prostitutes odometers fornicators [Music] are you with me if i get there and that's where where all of those kind of people are i will have realized i went to the wrong place i want you to think about this it is told that china is the one that created or had something to do of covering up this covet and i as a pastor of a church that has lost incredible pillars to it i'm mad at it i'm mad at this disease i don't like it none none had it fought with it didn't like it i think it's a cruel devil from hell absolutely do but that thing is under our feet i didn't fear it to start off with it i don't fear it now so not only is sin under our feet but every sickness is under our feet they may be watching today i'm sure they are but when i visited sister meadows yesterday in the in the home and i looked in those eyes and i could see those eyes just just as crystal clear as they could be it looked like you could have looked for a million miles i'll tell you what i didn't walk out of that room all down-hearted because of the situation i walked out of that room and around that house and i and these were my words brother meadows satan you're a loser we don't know how long it'll be but god will give her a body that will match the look in those eyes she'll be young again she'll be shouting on the heels of glory come on church no matter how sick that you get no matter how much sorrow no matter how much slavery that you've been through god's provided a blood that'll take care of that situation hallelujah when brother ron i say you don't have to wait till tomorrow right now stake your claim i could preach for another half an hour 45 minutes or another hour but i want to tell you get it today you're fighting this and that in your life stake your claim and look at it and say it's over and i want to read the scripture and i want you to hang on to it there is therefore now no condemnation hallelujah quit beating yourself for your past but i made a mistake one time when god looks at you through the blood of jesus christ he don't see it now i've come to this point and i'm going to drop this before i want to give you some advice as a bribe believers you don't need to know everybody's history are you with me we have when we're all together we have probably 200 maybe more than that none of you could say that brother ron wanted to know everything about me when i came here i look at pastoring like jesus looks at it what you did back there is under the blood leave it there don't dig it up leave it there press towards the mark of the high calling and if it's still bothering you repent to death repent today and say god i'm sorry that i've been carrying this mess on my back i'm putting it out i'm done with it well brother on where did jesus pastor well he picked a man that was naked on a boat cussing and said follow me satan would have never picked him and he picked a woman that was washing his feet and everybody in the room said if he knew who she was but she found the fountain of purity and she worshipped she found god and she truly repented and she was never that woman anymore if you'll notice peter was not that man anymore that woman was not that woman anymore the woman at the well said come see a man and she would have probably not been welcoming any of those synagogues but jesus being pastor and knowing what a predestinated seed was he wasn't looking at her past he was looking at her future i'm not looking at your past i'm looking at your future [Applause] you mind if we finish this next week let's stand to our feet hallelujah hallelujah ain't it good to us hallelujah ain't it good to us cancer you may trying to make me sick standing in this pool that i won't tell you you're not gonna win you're not gonna win i walked around my house this morning and i just prayed and i called the devil by name you know generally i don't pray and ask the devil to listen but this morning i've been sick all night i knew this sermon needed to be preached and i just i just started praying i said no satan i don't know where you are you're not like god you're not omniscient you're not omnipresent you're not everywhere you got to imps every place that you can have them and you're limited in your power but but i want you to listen if you keep having this cancer devil hang on with me and he's got to preach with me and he's got to sing with me and he's got to go to church if you're not careful i'll take him to church so long until eventually he'll either be evicted or he'll become a member of the church so i think today is a good day for him to leave sister autumn how long do you generally give for eviction notices days well we're gonna go before covet we're gonna go back to calvary let's give him an eviction notice my my struggle might be cancer what's your struggle why don't you just sign an eviction notice this morning saying you're leaving can i tell you one more story had two guys that were imposter preachers and they had came and they had they got a room upstairs for a labor day meeting and so i went up and asked him i said what's your agenda they said well we're just going to stay here a couple months and that's it no he said well we're expecting you to take care of us i said no and i said you need to get packed and ready to go you know they didn't pay much attention to me come here matthew and so when i couldn't get what i needed to get through to him i sent him come on they came down those steps up there with their suitcases in their hands i give them an eviction warning he gave them the eviction satan i want you to know we're giving you the eviction hallelujah and we're going to take all of that nonsense and throw it in the dumpster we don't need it no more how are you going to end this brother bartimaeus was one time known as a blind man but after jesus came and walked by his way he didn't need a cni lamb anymore and he didn't need nobody to lead him to the wall as a matter of fact he didn't even need glasses now this might interest you a little bit you have watched me over the last few months change classes watch me do it are you wasting your money brother ron yeah probably but you see it was told to restore all things and so the doctor told me that your eyes are getting better and

overcome it with your humanity how many ever dealt with those things things that you couldn't deal with to humanity you pray this prayer god i can't do it on my own and i'm going to expose some things that you already know i need help with and allow the god with his sanctifying power to go down in there and get the roots of that thing out and die to that thing and let god cleanse you and then let him fill you with the holy ghost his own life and then you thank him for it it isn't that hard is it it didn't it all right oh but it's so hard brethren really it can happen in moments moments seconds
