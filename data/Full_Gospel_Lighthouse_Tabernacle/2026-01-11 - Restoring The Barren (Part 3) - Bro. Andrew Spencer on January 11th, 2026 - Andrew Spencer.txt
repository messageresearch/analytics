We we also have brother Thomas Ber that's going to be here uh from Elkton, Kentucky this coming weekend and we're certainly uh looking forward to that.

Oh, he's awesome. He's awome. He's awome. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we come before you, Father, realizing, Lord Jesus, how great and how marvelous are thy ways. How wonderful are thy truths, Lord, for they are marrow to our bones, Lord. They energize our spirit, Father. Quicken our soul, make us alive, make us new. And Father, you've uh granted us the opportunity, Lord Jesus, to one more time hear thy word, to receive all the many blessings, Father, that you have given to us so freely. And we desire, Lord Jesus, today to come before you, Father, with thanksgiving and praise upon our lips. We desire, Lord Jesus, that you would just minister to us, Lord. We're your children. And Father, when we don't know what to do sometimes, the greatest thing that we can do is just stop and thank you and praise you, Father. We pray today from our lips, from our soul, from our innermost being, Father, that there would be such a bubbling up of joy on the inside of our hearts. Father, that your great condescending power would condescend upon your church, Father. Lord Jesus, I I realize, God, that we're in a special moment. Father, I feel like there's something supernatural going to take place here today, Lord. just in my spirit, Lord, I feel like I feel like you're going to come and benefit your children today. So, Father, may may as our faith aligns with your word, Father, may you do exactly what you have said. And may our faith and our hearts and our and our spirits and everything about our dayto-day activities, oh God. May everything be in line with your word, Father, so that we could come before your great presence, Lord, realizing that we're washed and we're made clean. We are in a place where you can deal with our hearts. Hallelujah. We ask God that you'd come today as we dedicate this service to you. We love you so much, Lord. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. If you have your Bibles today, I'd like to look in the book of Joel chapter 2 and verse 25 and then to Malachi chapter 4. Malachi 4 and 5. like to speak to you again on I will restore. I will restore. Trust this study has been okay for you. Realize that we've been given a a great message in this hour. A great message and so thankful for it. Aren't you? Amen. Joel 2 and verse 25. And I will restore to you the years. The years. The years. It been a lot of years. Been a lot of ages that went by. But God says, "I will restore to you the years." You remember when the king was dead, what did he do? He asked for more years. Maybe you haven't served God the best of your abilities in some of your years. But maybe you say, "God, would restore to me the years that I spent wasting my time. Now give me the opportunity to serve you from the depths of my soul. And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the cankerworm, and the caterpillar, and the palmer, and my great army, which I sent amongst you. You shall eat in plenty, and be satisfied, and praise the name of the Lord your God, that it dwelt wondrously with you. and my people shall never be ashamed. And you shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am the Lord your God, and none else. And my people shall never be ashamed. And it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy. Your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions, and also upon the servants, and upon the handmmaids. In those days will I pour out my spirit. Malachi chapter 4 verse 5. Behold I will send you. How many is identified as a UC class here this morning? Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord. And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse. May God bless his word. You may be seated. To me, it is one of my greatest honors if I could say that. It has been my honor in all things to to be a part of the message of the hour. To realize what what what class that we're actually sitting in this this morning to realize how wonderful that the Lord has been to us. That the message of the hour could come by our way and minister to us because it could have went by a lot of people. It could have went by a lot of places and it did, but there was a lot of people that could not receive it because they were not in a position and they were not elected before the foundation of the world to receive this great message that you and I have. So for me to be able to say it is my honor in anything. It is my greatest honor in this world to say that I'm a part of the message of the hour and to say that we follow the teachings of William Brandom. We realize that there are many people that might hear this for the first time or there might be people that hear it on the internet may not understand everything that we teach here and that we that we have this great understanding on the message of the hour. But we realize we realize this that God had said in his word that I was going to send you Elijah. And many people will look at that and we would see many people hear it from the from an outside realm and they would think that they would think that we're lifting up William Brandom. That's absolutely contrary. But what we're doing is putting ourselves right back in line where the word can be preeminent in the church of the living God. And you'll know, brother Brandham, if you've ever studied, if you've spent time studying out the message, you know good and well that brother Brandham never taugh put his teachings over top of the word. One time, Brother Brandham was at a personal friend's house and they had they had uh on their mantel, they had the Bible sitting there and on top of the Bible, they had one of brother Brandham's books. And brother Brandham walked over to the manel and they was just doing it halfaphazardly just stuck it up there. But brother Brandham told him said 'n now don't you ever do that. He said because my teachings come right here from this word right here. So when you go to studying out the message of the hour, brother Brandham is not bringing a new idea. Brother Brandham is not coming with his own ideology. Brother Brandham is simply as a messenger of the age. He is spending great time and tying up those loose ends and he's bringing those things back together. And brother William did a wonderful job a few few months ago speaking on what the message is. And if you hadn't heard it, go back and listen to it. Brother brother brother William did a wonderful job. I love his ministry in that way. But we look at this. We love we love this message because we realize that it is life to us. It is it is it gives us a great power when we realize and recognize what the message of the hour truly is. It's putting a church back on her feet again. But we when you look at the Elijah ministry, if you if you haven't if you haven't gotten this book on the five comingings of Elijah, Brother Timuit had put together, it'd be a great blessing for you to go and read those things. I believe we got them back there at the tape library or at at the book there, so you can grab it. If you don't have it, we got plenty more. But we realize when you go to looking at the Elijah Ministry, we realize that that that the Elijah ministry can be looked at in a few different ways. that the Elijah ministry to a lot of people that they'll look at it that the Elijah ministry was quite destructive. But they there's another way of looking at it is that the Elijah ministry came to restore and every single time that God used the spirit of Elijah to go and speak and deal with his children. All the Elijah ministry was to do was to restore God's people back to being God's re God's people again. And you notice in the first coming of Elijah, you will see that he begin to go in there and he restored the authority when he showed that he had the power to be able to go up there and shut up the heavens and he had the authority to loose the heavens at the same time. The Elijah ministry showed that he had the ability to restore life when there was a dead when there was a dead son and he raised him back to life again. It's the first resurrection that is accounted for in the Bible. You see him also go in there and restore provision to a to a little old widow woman that only had meal and some oil there. And what did the Elijah ministry do? He restored the spiritual food in due season. Then you see the greatest to me one of the greatest spots is where you see the Elijah ministry come in is you see him restoring back true worship again. You notice when he goes in there, HE GOES TO CALLING ISRAEL BACK TOGETHER and he doesn't HE DOESN'T CALL THEM BACK to a mixture of gods. HE BRINGS THEM OUT OF A mixture of denominations and BAAL WORSHIP AND BAAL IDEAS AND HE BRINGS THEM BACK TO the worship of a true and living God. He showed them what it was to do when he restored the broken altar and he took all 12 stones. And it's powerful when you study it. HE BUILDS ISRAEL RIGHT BACK in its position again. He didn't put 10 stones back in their place. He put all 12 stones back in their place and he restored that broken ALTAR BECAUSE FIRE CANNOT fall on A BROKEN HEART. FIRE CANNOT fall on A BROKEN ALTAR. SO THAT'S WHY THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR IS SO POWERFUL IS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE HOLY GHOST IS THAT THE HOLY GHOST COULD NOT FULLY COME UPON YOUR LIFE UNTIL YOU HAD A RESTORED HEART. AND THAT IS WHAT THE MINISTRY OF ELIJAH IS TO DO. IT'S TO RESTORE YOUR HEART BACK TO THE FAITH of the Pentecostal fathers. Now, brother Bradam say, excuse me, brother brother Puit says here, and I just want to draw this in the five comingings of Elijah. He said, "This is the work of Elijah." His trademark of his ministry is to restore worship back to whom it belongs. and by repairing and restoring THE ALTAR AND TURNING THE HEARTS BACK to the original AND TRUE FAITH. HE SAID THAT IS WHAT THE SPIRIT OF Elijah will do each time that he comes. That is THAT HE WILL NOT INSTITUTE a new religion. William Brandham did not institute a new religion but rather he will take the STONES OF THE ORIGINAL FOUNDATIONAL DOCTRINES AND PUT THEM BACK IN THEIR PROPER POSITION AND TURN THE HEARTS OF THE BELIEVERS BACK TO THE ORIGINAL FAITH. SO WE LOOK THAT THE MINISTRY OF ELIJAH IS TO RESTORE THE FAITH. WHAT WAS THE MINISTRY OF MALACHI 4 TO DO? IT WAS TO PUT THE POWER BACK IN THE CHURCH. TO PUT FAITH BACK IN OPERATION AGAIN. YOU WATCH WHAT WAS THE FIRST PULL OF BROTHER BRANDHAM'S MINISTRY. IT WAS TO SIMPLY PUT THE BAIT OUT THERE ON THE HOOK AND SHOW THEM. SHOW OUT THERE BECAUSE HE WAS GOING AFTER A RAINBOW TROUT AND IT CALLED A LOT OF PEOPLE IN. WHAT DID IT DO? IT RESTORED THE FAITH BACK TO THE CHURCH TO REALIZE. YOU THINK YOU GOT GREAT MEN LIKE CONGRESSMAN UPSHAW THAT WOULD SIT there in A LITTLE HILLBILLY KENTUCKY MEETINGS BY THE NAME OF WILLIAM BRANDHAM. A MAN THAT HAD SAT WITH SOME OF THE GREATEST IN THE UNIVERSE THAT HAD SET IN THE GREATEST OF THE GOVERNMENTS. THERE HE WAS SITTING LISTENING TO A MAN HALLELUJAH THAT HAD THE ABILITY TO RESTORE HIS FAITH THAT GOD WAS STILL GOD. HALLELUJAH. ME AND MY wife was watching a documentary a while back. A man that was dealing with cancer and he was HAD TUMORS IN HIS BODY AND HE HAD WENT EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD trying to FIND FAITH OR TRYING TO GET HEALED AND TRYING TO GET A MIRACLE. HE WENT TO THIS CHURCH. HE WENT TO THAT CHURCH. HE WENT HERE. THIS IS A MODERN-DAY MAN. HE WENT TO THIS CHURCH. HE WENT OVERSEAS. HE WENT HERE AND THERE. AND I THOUGHT, MY GOD, THERE THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR HAS BEEN SETTING HERE. HE DIDN'T HAVE TO GO ACROSS THIS PLACE AND THAT PLACE OR HERE. ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS COME BACK BECAUSE THIS MESSAGE WILL RESTORE YOUR FAITH TO BELIEF THAT ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE. WHAT DID CONGRESSMAN UPSHAW? HE WAS BOUND 66 YEARS. BUT IN A MATTER OF A SECOND, A VISION SPOKE OVER HIS LIFE AND HE WAS COMPLETELY MADE WHOLE. &gt;&gt; What did the message of William Brandham do? It put faith back in oper operation. IT PUT POWER BACK IN THE CHURCH where it rightly should have been. And when IT'S SO POWERFUL IS WHEN IT COMES TO YOUR LIFE AND YOU REALIZE THAT it ain't just for William Brandon. HALLELUJAH. WHEN YOU REALIZE IT AIN'T JUST FOR THE PREACHER. WHEN YOU REALIZE IT'S FOR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. WHEN YOU REALIZE IT'S FOR EVERY ONE OF YOU. THAT THAT IS WHERE KNOWING THAT THE AUTHORITY HAS BEEN GIVEN BACK TO THE CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD. THAT IT'S NOW IN TIME IN TIME TO IMPART TO GO TO THE ANGEL, TAKE THE BOOK, EAT THE BOOK, BECOME THE BOOK. SOMEONE IS GOING TO GRAB A HOLD OF THIS MESSAGE. THEY'RE GOING TO GRAB A HOLD OF THIS MESSAGE. EVEN THOUGH IT GOES TO WAR IN THEIR BODY, THEY'RE GOING TO EAT IT AND THEY'RE GOING TO KEEP IT DOWN. THEY'RE GOING TO EAT IT AND THEY'RE GOING TO KEEP IT DOWN. IF MICHAEL WAS STANDING UP, IF MALACHI 4 WAS STANDING UP, IF THE MINISTRY OF CHRIST WAS STANDING UP, THEN THERE'S GOT TO BE A BRIDE &gt;&gt; THAT'S IN THE SAME POSITION AS MICHAEL, AS CHRIST, AS WILLIAM BRHAM, IF A WAVE CHIEF OF THE MESSAGE WENT OVER, then there's got to be a people that's ready to stand up. Hallelujah. You remember we were on the wrong road, sis. We was going the wrong way. Just like the disciples on the road to Emmas, they was walking the wrong way. But when Jesus showed up AND JESUS STARTED TAKING THEM FROM DEITY OF CHRIST ALL THE WAY TO LEADERSHIP, WE WERE ON OUR WRONG ROAD. WE WERE GOING THE WRONG WAY. BUT WHEN JESUS BE TO BREAK THE BREAD OF LIFE, HE OPENED THEIR UNDERSTANDING AND THEN THEY TURNED. THE MESSAGE turned is powerful. It turned their understanding and what took them all day to get over there where they was going. Just took them a few minutes to get back to where they was at. You see, he said, "I will restore to you the years." We know this, but God is going to have a church AGAINST ALL OF SATAN'S OPPOSITIONS. GOD is going to have a church. COULD I SAY IT TO YOU LIKE THIS? IS THAT GOD'S GOT A CHURCH AND HE'S GOT A LADY THAT DESTROYED TO REFUSE TO LISTEN TO MS AND SAY THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE HER LEGACY. THERE WAS A LADY, SISTER CHASSITY BOWMAN, THAT REFUSED TO BELIEVE THE DEVIL'S LIE BECAUSE GOD WILL HAVE A CHURCH. HALLELUJAH. MY SISTER WAS A WOMAN THAT COULDN'T HAVE CHILDREN, BUT GOD SAID, "I WILL HAVE A CHURCH THAT WILL BELIEVE THAT I CAN OPEN UP BARREN WOUNDS AGAIN BECAUSE GOD WILL HAVE A CHURCH." MARIAH PUIT WAS A PLACE AS A WAS A CONDITION WHERE THE SEED OF GOD COULD FALL IN A LITTLE BITTY TEENAGE GIRL AND SAY, "I DON'T KNOW IF THIS ALIPCIA, I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S GOING TO DO, BUT IT'S GOT TO LEAVE ME BECAUSE I GOT THE FAITH OF A MUSTARD SEED." AND WHAT DID GOD DO? HE PUT HAIR BACK ON THAT LITTLE GIRL'S HEAD BECAUSE GOD SAID, "I WILL HAVE A CHURCH. Do I have to remind you about your pastor? God will have a church. It wasn't just for the three Hebrew boys, but God said, "I will have a church that can walk through the fire. So, I'm going to raise up a Ron Spencer that can go through strokes and go through lightning strikes and GO THROUGH ALL THESE DIFFERENT DETAILS." Don't you take it from some great Don't take it for some small thing that God put the leadership here right in front OF THIS CHURCH RIGHT HERE IN ELTON to be a proof that God will HAVE A CHURCH AGAINST ALL ODDS AGAINST ALL ODDS. THAT GOD WILL DEMONSTRATE HIS GREAT POWER, HIS ABILITIES. BECAUSE GOD WILL HAVE A CHURCH THAT WILL REPRESENT HIM IN POWER, IN TRUTH, AND IN DEMONSTRATION. GOD WILL HAVE A CHURCH. They will be under his kingship, under the rulership of the baptism OF THE HOLY GHOST. THEY WILL BE BIRTHED BY THE WORD. THEY WILL BE BOUGHT BY THE WORD. AND THEY WILL ONLY SPEAK THE WORD. The Bible said in Galatians 3:7, "Know ye therefore that they which are of faith? The same are the children of Abraham, and the SCRIPTURE FORESEEING THAT GOD WOULD JUSTIFY THE HEATHEN through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, SAYING, IN THEE SHALL all nations be blessed." So then they WHICH BE OF FAITH ARE BLESSED. SOMEBODY SAY, "BLESSED, with faithful Abraham." SO THE CHURCH HAS GOT TO REALIZE THE POWER THAT'S BEEN GIVEN TO HER. You remember Jesus SAID, "WHATSOEVER YOU BIND ON EARTH, I WILL BIND IN HEAVEN. AND WHATSOEVER YOU loose on earth, I will loose in heaven." YOU'VE GOT TO REALIZE THAT WHEN JESUS IS STANDING THERE, HE SAID, "ALL POWER IN HEAVEN AND IN EARTH IS GIVEN UNTO ME, AND ALL THAT WAS IN CHRIST, GOD POURED IN THE CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD." SO WHY SHOULD WE FEAR OF WHAT COMES OUR WAY? WHY SHOULD WE WORRY ABOUT WHAT COMES OUR WAY? WHY SHOULD WE THINK AND BEGIN TO BE A DEEP THINKER ABOUT THE THINGS THAT CONSTANTLY ARE ATTACKING US? ARE YOU HEARING ME TODAY? The prophet said, "When every talk of fear is vanished and the Holy Spirit is completely in control of the church, THEN ALL FEARS ARE GONE. AND THAT CHURCH HAS THE POWER. WHY? They have everything between that everything that heaven owns behind them. They are ambassadors of the throne. Absolutely. AN AMBASSADOR. CHRIST HAS THE AUTHORITY. EVERYTHING THAT CHRIST OWNS BELONGS to that ambassador. Too many times people think, well, if I was in the days of William Brandham, you are still in the days of the son of man. COME ON, SOMEBODY. YOU DON'T NEED SOME PROPHET TO SIT HERE AND DISCERN YOUR HEART. YOU DON'T NEED SOME MAN OF GOD TO COME UP HERE AND SPEAK SOMETHING OVER YOUR LIFE. THIS MESSAGE HAS DISCERNED THE VERY THOUGHTS OF YOUR HEART. THERE IS ONLY ONE MALACHI 4. THERE IS ONLY ONE MESSIAH SIGN. THIS MESSAGE IS THE ANSWER TO THE DEVIL'S QUESTION. AND WHERE DID GOD CHOOSE TO PUT IT? ON THE INSIDE OF LITTLE OU. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. He said, "Oh, go into all the world. You are my witnesses after the Holy Ghost has come upon you." And what is a witness? It's an ambassador to come and WITNESS SOMETHING. THE WHOLE POWERS OF heavens is right in your hands. You know, we got these little kids here and I I they always ask that question. If you had If you could choose a power, what would it be? If you could choose a a hero power, would you fly? Would you be in the invisible man? Or would you would you just be able to look through certain things? I don't have to wonder what kind of power I would choose. I choose this power any day. I choose this power. I wouldn't choose to fly. I wouldn't choose to be able to just simply be like Batman and ride down a road. And I simply would I definitely wouldn't choose to be like Spider-Man. That would depend on some web to get caught up in. I wouldn't choose to be Superman and I wouldn't choose to be one of the one of the Avengers, but I choose to be a son of God. Come on, SOME I CHOOSE TO BE A SON OF GOD BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT ALL THE POWERS OF HEAVEN AND IN EARTH ARE DWELLING IN THE CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD. WHY LIMIT YOURSELF TO BE SUPERMAN OR BATMAN OR SPIDER-MAN WHEN YOU CAN BE GOD'S MAN FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST, SANCTIFIED, SET ASIDE SO GOD COULD USE YOU. WHY DO YOU SIT THERE AND TRY TO BE BARREN? DON'T BE DORMANT. DON'T BE BARREN. LET YOUR LIFE LIVE A FRUIT OF THE HOLY SPIRIT. &gt;&gt; IF A DEVIL'S ATTACKING YOU, CONDEMN THAT THING. WALK OVER THAT THING. IF SATAN'S ROBBING YOU, TAKE IT BACK. JAMES SAID in 1 and8, "Of his own will begott us with the word of truth." My daddy didn't convince me of this message. MY GRANDFATHER HOMER DID not condense convince me of this message. BUT I HAVE BEEN BEGOTTEN OF ALMIGHTY GOD. WHEN THE SON OF MAN STANDING there in LUKE 18 SAID, "WHEN I RETURN AGAIN, WILL I FIND FAITH?" I WOULD LIKE to announce there's a people in position THAT BELIEVE. THEY'RE NOT BARREN. THEY'RE NOT DORMANT. THEY'RE NOT WONDERING when I have a body. It's amazing to think that God has put on the inside of you the power to look the other way. You remember when brother would talk about a thinking man's filter? He said that thinking man, he said he'll look the other way when a woman walks down the road and she's got that ungodly dress on. You remember that preacher that stood here? He said some people some people sit there and say, "Oh my, look at that sin." But the prophet said, "A thinking man will turn HIS HEAD." AIN'T IT POWERFUL TO RECOGNIZE that the church OF THE LIVING GOD HAS GOT THE POWER TO LOOK THE OTHER WAY INSTEAD OF LOOKING? AND I KNOW IT'S A POWERFUL THING WHEN YOU CAN TURN YOUR HEAD AND NOT LOOK AT THEM THINGS. BUT LET'S LOOK AT IT IN A DEEPER PERSPECTIVE. TURN YOUR HEAD AWAY FROM NEGATIVE THOUGHTS. TURN YOUR HEAD AWAY FROM FAILURES. TURN YOUR HEAD AWAY FROM SIN. TURN YOUR HEAD AWAY FROM MISTAKES. A THINKING MAN WILL TURN HIS HEAD. I'M NOT THE SAME GUY BECAUSE I AM CONTROLLED BY A POWER. I am NOT MY OWN. MY LIFE IS NOT MY OWN. I am bought with a price. The prophet said in questions answers. He said the law of the spirit of God in the heart overcomes the flesh and makes the body obey what the heart says do. THE BODY HAS TO OBEY WHAT THE HEART SAYS DO. HE SAID LOOK THEN if it will do that for a sinner then won't it do it for sickness too? IF IT'LL MAKE YOUR HEART MAKE IF YOUR HEART WILL MAKE YOUR BODY OBEY WHAT YOU SAY, THEN SURELY THEN IT CAN MAKE SICKNESS DO THE SAME THING. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE SCRIPTURE AND YOU REALIZE YOU CAN'T DO IT ON YOUR OWN, BUT THE BIBLE SAID IN ISAIAH 53 AND5 THAT BY HIS STRIPES I AM HEALED. THEN YOUR BODY HAS GOT TO OBEY WHAT YOUR HEART SAYS DO. &gt;&gt; SICKNESS HAS GOT TO LISTEN TO ME. DEMONS HAVE GOT TO LISTEN TO ME BECAUSE THERE'S SOMETHING THAT IS CONTROLLING THE INSIDE OF ME. It's like It's like maybe we'll just put it in this picture. This building, this building here, we have a hard time with a thermostat here. We can't please everybody. So, they try to please some people. But it's I won't tell you who them some people are, but I believe you got a good idea because you got some people that are shivering cold. You got some people that are about to give this place wings. They're flying off. They got everything going all at one time. You know what I'm saying is I'm trying not to look at you because I don't want to see what you're doing out there. But do you realize this that on the outside there that that that this building it can become IT CAN BECOME A CIRCUMSTANCE OF WHAT IS HAPPENING on the outside. So like right now it's it's very cold outside and it's going to get colder because we're in the dead of winter. BUT YOU REALIZE THIS IS THERE'S SOME CONTROLLING POWER THAT WE'VE HAD SOME BROTHERS SET UP HERE AND IT'S CALLED THE THERMOSTAT. AND THAT THERMOSTAT AND EVEN THOUGH EVEN THOUGH THERE'S SOMETHING COLD ON THE OUTSIDE, THE THERMOSTAT SAYS, "OH NO, I GOT TO HAVE IT AT SUCH AND SUCH TEMPERATURE." SO THE THERMOSTAT ON THE INSIDE CONTROLS WHAT IS HAPPENING ON THE OUTSIDE. SO YOU CAN SAY, "I WILL NOT BE A VICTIM OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF WHAT HAPPENS IN LEOSA. I WILL REFUSE TO LISTEN TO THE LIE OF THE DEVIL, BUT I WILL LET THE HOLY GHOST TAKE CONTROL OF ME AND CONTROL THE OUTSIDE. SOMEBODY IS GOING TO REFUSE THE LIE OF THE DEVIL. SOMEBODY'S GOING TO STEP UP AND ACCEPT THAT GOD'S FOR THEM. CONTROL THAT THING. CONTROL YOUR TEMPER. CONTROL MALICE. CONTROL THE LYING SPIRIT OF HELL. DON'T LET THE DEVIL LIE TO YOU AND TELL YOU YOU DON'T HAVE POWER AND ABILITY. &gt;&gt; I got a thermostat. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So I decide what conditions. I decide because I'm representing heaven. I decide what I will control. I decide with my decisions. Well, I will refuse to speak the devil's language or I choose to speak God's. You got a choice here this morning. What's going to happen in your life? You going to set the conditions of your life and you're going to let Satan rob you. GOD SAID, "I WILL RESTORE." SO, EITHER you're going to sit there and let Satan rob from you and keep on robbing from you, or one of these DAYS, YOU'RE GOING TO WAKE up and realize that you got something on the inside OF YOU THAT GOD ORDAINED BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. WILLIAM BRANDHAM SAID, "OH, I WISH THAT THE CHURCH HAD THEIR JOY SHELL SHOES ON." HE SAID, "OH, THAT I WISH THAT YOU HAD THE JOY SHOES ON." HE SAID, "HOW DO YOU GET YOUR JOY SHOES ON?" HE SAID, "KNOWING THAT YOUR NAME WAS WRITTEN ON THE LAMB'S BOOK OF LIFE BEFORE YOU COULD EVER MAKE THE WRONG CHOICE." SO, THE CHOICES I'M MAKING IS CONTROLLED BY THE FATHER. I was looking at this, just looking at it as a pastor where to lay these things at and in order and the spirit of God talked to me and said, "Turn it loose." And I thought, "Turn it loose." All right. And to me, one of the greatest stories about turning it loose is David is that David had to make a decision because we we realize that brother Brandham when he he laces this in in restoration of bribery and I've always been amazed at this is that brother Brandham went home after listening to brother Orman Neville preach a subject and went home and said he went a few notes He come backs and preach one of the greatest masterpieces that ever has been. I tell you what, it's good to have an angel there to talk to you, ain't it? And here he is. He comes back and he laces in these powerful things. And if you go to studying it out and studying restoration of the bride and you actually study it out in segments, it's powerful because brother Brandham laces in some very powerful things. And he starts talking about a bird, how that a bird has got a law and it's got the law of aerodynamics where it's got so much power. It's got thrust. It's got lift in it. And you see gravity is still at work. But that bird defies that law of gravity because he's got a law on the inside of him to defy that thing. Then brother Brandon talks about a fish. He said that fish has got a law. He said it's got the ability to take take its abilities and go in and sink all the way down to the bottom. Now you try to reverse them two laws between the bird and the fish and they actually they'll die completely because they don't have the abilities. They don't have the abilities to go where the other one can go. And you have been given a power to go where Satan can never get to. You've been given a law that only only you can go there. The church world can't go there. Demons of hell can't go there. And even though they might whisper in your ear and constantly attack you, but I want you to know that you got a rock that you can go to because you're an eagle under an eagle anointing and you were born by a law to lift up in a little bit higher. And you're going TO HAVE TO DEFY THE LAWS OF GRAVITY. IF YOUR arm can raise ITS HAND AND DEFY THE ACTS OF GRAVITY, THEN SO CAN YOUR SOUL DEFY THE ACTS OF HELL. BECAUSE DAVID DID THE SAME EXACT THING WHEN HE BEGIN TO STAND OUT THERE AND HE WOULD HEAR THE BOAST OF THE ENEMY AND HE WOULD SAY THEY'RE THEY'RE A BUNCH OF SCAREDY-CATS. THEY'RE AFRAID AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHO THEY ARE. BUT DAVID HAD A FAITH THAT HE WAS GOING TO TURN LOOSE. HE WAS GOING TO LET THAT LAW OF FAITH LOOSE. AND NOTICE WHAT DID DAVID DO? HE BEGIN TO PROPHESY TO THAT OLD D THAT OLD GIANT. HE BE TO GO OUT THERE AND TALK TO HIM. HE TALKED TO SAUL. HE TALKED TO ALL THE PEOPLE WHEN THEY MADE FUN OF HIM AND SAID HE WAS NOTHING BUT a shrimp THAT CALLED HIM THAT HE'D COME UP THERE JUST TO SEE THE BATTLE. BUT DAVID HAD SOMETHING THAT HE WAS GOING TO TURN LOOSE THAT DAY AND HE WAS GOING TO BE MORE THAN FAITH. HE WAS GOING TO TURN LOOSE A STONE. HALLELUJAH. What did he do? He started talking about his past testimonies that God healed me of varicose veins. that God did that and I will not forget it. That God healed me of bitterness and I will not forget it. You see, there was a a line that came in and took a part of my earthly father's possession and I cannot forget how God used me that day when I was standing there in that field and I thought, "My God, I've got to represent Christ in this way. That door though I got 99 over here. That one still means something to my father and I'm not a true shepherd unless I go after that one sheep." You see, that's why God has ordained a pastor to stand there and go after that one lost sheep. He go out there and get him back because it means something to him. But this day, this was more than his earthly father's possession of a sheep. But this was his heavenly father's possession that all the children of Israel were up there. WHAT DID DAVID DO? DAVID TURNED THEIR FEAR INTO FAITH. WHEN THEY SAW A LITTLE BITTY OLD BOY, HE TURNED LOOSE HIS FAITH. AND THAT LITTLE BITTY BOY WENT AFTER HIS FATHER'S HIS HEAVENLY FATHER'S POSSESSION AND HE TURNED THEIR FEAR INTO FAITH. WHAT DID WILLIAM BRANDHAM DO IN THIS HOUR WHEN THAT MANIAC OUT THERE IN OREGON? HE TURNED THEIR FEAR INTO FAITH. &gt;&gt; So you are either going to control it or it's going to control you. Anybody ever been, maybe don't raise your hand, been in a controlling relationship? They control where you go. They control where you eat dinner. And that's your own family. They only let you go there. You choose what you eat. Now, my wife is not that kind of woman, but she does give me some instruction. A little more salad and a little still a little whole lot of ice cream. But you know good and well, God sent a man by the name of Brother Matthew McClarden. He sent me a word this week. Praise God. A little little clip. I I bless you, Sister Dorothy. You got a real man. He's up there preaching in Ohio and we praying for him. But he sent me this beautiful clip. Brother Chris is that doctor say that ice cream's good for you. Now, I don't know, probably don't align with some doctors, but you know, you got the ability to choose what doctor you going to listen to. So, where was I going with that? You're going to let control you what you're going to let control you. And there are certain places where people will let certain relationships control them. They control where they can fellowship at. They can control what church they go to. They can control what they listen to. I found out about our Lord Jesus Christ. He does not have to put you in a cage to control you. There's so many people that look at this message as dos and don'ts. They look at it as, well, I got to wear I'm I'm just going to drop a few things. It's not in my notes, but I'm going to drop a few things. There's there's a lot of people that look at the dos and don'ts and they they say, "Well, I got I if I'm going to serve God, I can't do this and I can't do that." Well, they preach about them skinny jeans and I can't wear them things and I really want to. Let me tell you something. I question you if you want to wear skinny jeans. Look like a skin down wiener. I don't know how in the dickens these boys get in them things. Must have a parachute that drops them right down in them thing. Look like a sausage. It's got links all around it. And then, well, if I if I serve God, I won't be able to wear my my dress just right so I can show my humps and my bumps. Look like two raccoons trying to get out of a sack. I found out about the message. It does not control you. William Brandham didn't control you. William Brandham didn't set certain things and say you got to do this or you're not going in the rapture. You know good and well that your pastor has never taken a shotgun and held it to your head said you sisters if you don't show up here with long hair. Anybody Anybody ever here had had that happen to them? I don't think so. ANYBODY HERE HAD A HAD when he when you wasn't just living right and all of a sudden the pastor come there says, "If you don't get to church by God and come here on SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY MORNING AND SHOW UP, YOU'RE GOING TO MISS IT." NAH. Cuz we ain't that kind of people and we ain't preaching that kind of a message. Because I know this that the law of the Holy Ghost will control all that is right. As I said last night, I didn't read no book on how to BE A DADDY AND MY WIFE DIDN'T READ A BOOK ON HOW TO BE A MAMA. WE SIMPLY TOOK IT RIGHT OUT OF THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO GO TO READ SOME BOOK OF HOW LONG YOU GOT TO WEAR YOUR SLEEVES AND DON'T CUT YOUR HAIR AND DO THOSE THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. You look at THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE JUST COME IN TO THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. YOU LOOK AT THEM, THEY SIMPLY DROPPED OFF THE THINGS THAT THEY KNEW WASN'T RIGHT. WHY? BECAUSE THE WORD DID IT. YOU AIN'T GOT TO SKIN SHEEP. THE WORD WILL TAKE PLACE. THE WORD WILL TAKE PREEMINENCE. YOU AIN'T GOT TO BEAT PEOPLE INTO IT. LET THEM LOVE IT. But I will tell you this. You are meant to control the devil. &gt;&gt; I love this. This is the first portion of restorational labri. So we'll just go through this. He said in paragraph 85, he said like if somebody stole some property and they're holding the property captive and then you take the law and go after this person and the law forces and enforces this person to restore that property back to its natural power. HE SAID ENFORCEMENT. HE SAID ENFORCE. Then we are have the privilege to enforce upon Satan the claims that God give us. For God has a law and his word is a law. And God in this word made certain claims to the church. Therefore, we have a right to force THESE CLAIMS UPON SATAN AND SAY GIVE IT BACK. HE HAS TO DO IT BECAUSE WE CAN TAKE GOD'S AGENT, the Holy Spirit, AND GO RIGHT DOWN ON OUR KNEES AND SAY IT'S THUS SAYAITH THE LORD. HE'S GOT TO GIVE IT UP. THAT'S ALL. Because the Holy Spirit is there to make him do it. The law of the land is TO ENFORCE. IT'S BY THE LAND and for the land. But the law of THE SPIRIT OF GOD IS TO FORCE SATAN TO GIVE UP THAT WHICH HE has unrightfully, DECEITFULLY TAKEN FROM ALL FROM GOD. ALL THE SOULS OF MEN HAVE GOT TO COME BACK. HEALING IS THE CHILDREN BREAD. IT BELONGS TO US. JOY, GIVE IT BACK. RESTORATION, GIVE IT BACK. YOU ARE TO TAKE IT BY FORCE. Jesus said the kingdom SUFFER VIOLENCE, BUT THE VIOLENT TAKE IT BY FORCE. YOU GOT TO GET VIOLENT IN YOUR NATURE. YOU GOT TO GET VIOLENT IN YOUR NATURE AND SAY, "SATAN, THESE ARE MY CHILDREN." COME ON, DAVID. IT'S TIME TO GO DOWN TO ZIGLAG AND TAKE BACK WHAT IS RIGHTFULLY YOURS. SATAN, I ENFORCE YOU BY THE POWER OF THE HOLY GHOST. GIVE IT BACK. These signs shall follow them that believe in my name. They shall cast out devils in my name. They shall speak in tongues in my name. They shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover in my name. This is not THE NAME OF A FATHER, NOT the name of a son, not the name of the holy ghost, but the name of all of heaven. And who I am representing. Heaven is here this morning to say, "Satan, you have deceitfully robbed the children of God of all of their inheritance." I say in THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST, "GIVE IT BACK. GIVE IT BACK. GIVE IT BACK. GIVE ME BACK MY JOY. GIVE ME BACK MY PEACE. GIVE ME BACK MY ATMOSPHERE. GIVE ME BACK MY PRAISE." THE PROPHET said in divine healing, he said, "If we're living in this day when formalities and things is broken, the church down, broke away," he said, "It's God's word being fulfilled." As sure as God said these signs will follow them that believe, as sure as God said these churches would be like they are now, God also has said this opposition would meet it. So the same God that ordained signs and wonders, ordained at these should be persecuting against it. When you study Joel chapter 2 and you look at the destroyers, these bugs, the locust, the cankerworm, the palmer, and the caterpillar, when you look at it, we realize, you study the nature of it. You look in there and you see it is the antichrist spirit that is representing Rome and how that is coming in there to steal, to kill, and destroy. And they you watch these books that they systematically strip away the bride of its life. When you study when you study the message, you'll find it. But brother Brandham laces it in there so heavily there in the restoration of the bride tree. And he identifies this locust and you you study it. He said you look that locust. He said he focused on eating the leaves of that tree. He said the leaves of that tree was divine fellowship. He said the coolness or the freshness where people can find their rest in the Holy Spirit. But God said I will restore. And the Bible said in Acts 3:19 that when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord, it is a part of the restoration that you can have a refreshing from the Lord. He said that that locust come in and it started to eat down brotherhood. He said the locust destroyed the fellowship between believers to different groups leading the formation of exclusive groups and exclusive organizations or clicks. You see what they did? They refuse to associate WITH OTHERS. AND TOO MANY TIMES YOU FIND THAT AMONGST MESSAGE BELIEVERS THAT SAME LOCUST BUG TRIES TO COME IN THERE SAID, "WELL, THEY'RE ONENESS." OR MAYBE THEY BELIEVE in the supernatural or THEY THEY BELIEVE THE WORD AND THEY THEY BELIEVE IN THE SPIRIT OR THIS THAT OR THE OTHER. THAT'S THAT SAME BOOK TRYING TO DISASSOCIATE WHAT GOD HAS SO PUT TOGETHER BY THE HOLY SPIRIT. BUT PAUL SAID IN EPHESIANS 4 AND THREE, ENDEAVORING TO KEEP THE UNITY OF THE SPIRIT IN THE BOND OF PEACE. THERE IS ONE BODY, ONE SPIRIT, even as YOU ARE CALLED IN THE ONE HOPE OF YOUR CALLING, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God AND FATHER OF ALL WHO IS ABOVE ALL, THROUGH all and in you all. So when you see that bug come in, you refuse that devil. That's my brother. That's my sister. Maybe I don't see things like they do, but they're still my brother. You see a prophet stood here and made you aware of the bug of antichrist spirit that would try to come in. He goes on to say that the cankerworm he said if you study it out you see he said he went in there that cankerworm he said it bored right into the bark and brother Brandham said that the bark was the covering. He said it was the lifeline of the tree. He said it was religion. He said you watch that cankerworm's characteristics. He said it destroyed the church's original apostolic doctrine. What did it do? It went in there. It went in there and tried to rob the truth and the power away from the church of the living God. But the Bible said, "I will restore." And in Acts 2 and 42, THE BIBLE SAID, "AND THEY CONTINUE STEADFASTLY IN THE APOSTLES DOCTRINE AND FELLOWSHIP." THAT'S WHY WHEN BROTHER MATTHEW WAS SPEAKING LAST WEEKEND ON BEING STEADFAST, YOU GOT TO STAY STEADFAST IN THE DOCTRINES BECAUSE WE ARE WE ARE POWERLESS WITHOUT TRUTH. &gt;&gt; WE ARE POWERLESS WITHOUT DOCTRINES. You take away our doctrines from us or simply just another church building. That enemy wants to come in there and make you include every devil in this world. The Bible said, The Bible said, "I will restore." What did they come in there and do? What was the What was the greatest thing they did? They went right after the water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ. You walk shankermorm how he comes in and caners at me. You watch what Brother Brandham said. He said, "You see that Roman power?" He said, 'It's worming its way right through the right through the cabinets, getting right in there with our governors and our senators and all all of our presidents and different things. He said it's warming. It's way right in there. But you watch what that canker worm did. It started to caner. You don't have to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Jesus said that you go into all the world baptizing them in the name of the father, son, and holy ghost. But you'll notice this that every single time that the early believers baptized, they baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And you see, you study out Catholic history, you'll go in there and find they said, "Well, no, look, if you go all the way out, if you go back there, yeah, they did that. They Yeah, they did that back there in the early ' 80s. But when you get up here, you recognize that the church was baptized in the name of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost." You know why? because the Catholic Church was killing anybody and everybody that was baptized in THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; BUT GOD SAID, "I WILL RESTORE." AND WHAT HAPPENED IN THIS HOUR IS THAT GOD HAD A PROPHET THAT BROUGHT US BACK NOT TO ONE LORD. HE DIDN'T JUST BRING US BACK TO JESUS ONLY. HE TOOK US BACK THAT JESUS WAS DEITY HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; THEY BAPTIZE ONLY IN THE NAME OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST. You see what that cankerworm did? It also went in there and took away the sacrifice. He said it went in there and took away the understanding of the blood of Jesus Christ. But God said I will restore. Paul said in n Hebrews 9:14, "How much more shall the blood of Christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without the spot of to God purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God? I will restore." And they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony. I will restore that cankerworm. Come in there and replace the spirit of truth with a spirit of creeds. Brother Brandham said they come in there. And I always I always loved when brother Brandham said that because brother Brandham had a way of making making words. He said they come in there with their unauthoritative words. What is an unauthoritative word? But it means it's got no power. He said what they did, they come in there and he said they gave them a form of godliness but they denied the power thereof. He went on further to say he said what they did. He said they come in there with their embombing fluids and they started pumping the church full of all this inbombing fluids of creeds and it went right down into their wombs that they can't bring forth children no more. It went right down there in the in the basement where they put the altar down there. It might rent right down there in the veins of the church. They're no fork and they never bring forth power and demonstration that can never bring forth signs and wonders because they've been pumped full of inbombing fluid because Satan wants to keep the church of the living God dead. &gt;&gt; But if you want to find authority, if you want to find authoritative words, the brother Brandham said that the never failing presence of Jesus Christ IS WITH YOU ALWAYS. AND THE ANGEL of the Lord accompanies the message. If you want to have some AUTHORITATIVE WORDS, GET BACK TO TALKING THE MESSAGE. And then he went in to the palm of he said its primary target was the fruit of the tree. Now you know good and well he's been after your fruit. He's been after your fruit. Well, how do you say that, Brother Andrew? I'll say it according to the word. The Bible said, "Praise ye the Lord." Let everything that hath breath praise ye the Lord. And I don't I don't mean to make this personal, but I am going to say it to you as a church. And if you don't want to listen to me on the internet, and I'm sorry for you, you have to listen to me, but those on the internet can click me off. But this church has constantly been criticized for her worship. This church has constantly been criticized for her praise, for her liberty in the message of the hour. And that's all right. That's all right. I really don't I really don't mind the criticism because criticism only shows where our true character is at. But you watch what he's tried to do to this church. He's tried to come in there and steal the very things that has been restored back to the church of the living God. It is our God-given right to worship the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, God said, "I will restore." And I believe THIS THAT THERE'S REAL HOLY GHOST PRAISE. There's real Holy Ghost worship. There's real Holy GHOST JOY. AND I believe this that if we're going to do anything, then we OUGHT TO DO IT BY THE BIBLE. IS THAT RIGHT? IF WE'RE GOING TO WORSHIP, THEN WE OUGHT TO WORSHIP BY THE BIBLE. IF WE'RE GOING TO SHOUT, THEN WE OUGHT TO SHOUT BY THE BIBLE. IF WE'RE GOING TO DANCE, WE OUGHT TO DANCE BY THE BIBLE. AND GOD SAID, "I WILL RESTORE." &gt;&gt; SO, I'M NOT GOING TO LET SOME DEVIL COME IN THERE AND TRY TO STEAL IT AWAY FROM YOU. &gt;&gt; GOD GAVE YOU JOY. &gt;&gt; GOD GAVE YOU PEACE. GOD GAVE YOU HOLINESS. AND AIN'T NO DEVIL GOING TO TAKE IT AWAY FROM YOU. I WILL NOT BE LIKE MICHELLE AND MAKE FUN OF YOU OF YOU DANCING IN TRUE WORSHIP. BUT I SAY IF THE WORDS BACK IN ITS ORDER AND WE'RE WORKING RIGHT IN ACCORDING TO GOD'S PLAN, THEN LET'S DANCE. &gt;&gt; You know why you're dancing. &gt;&gt; Sure. I know. There's a there's a holy dance and there's a worldly dance. If anybody knows that, I do. I learned how to dance in a club. I I I'm a I'm a real guy. I'm a real guy. I lived a former life. But I d The first place I danced was in a club. The first place I danced was dance parties. I was talking to Brother Alen last night. how how in the world we're here, but we're here. Praise God. And I I told him, I said, "You ever you ever been one of them dances where they where they used to do that old call and they call him out there said, "Now, spin your partner around and round." And I always enjoyed watching them things. Again, I'm I'm I'm honest. You say, "Brother Andrew, you shouldn't be saying those things." Well, sorry. You ain't got to listen to me. But I you know, that's where I I learned to dance. And then I got saved and somebody said, 'You know what? You used to dance a whole lot more when he's out there in the world. And I got thinking about that. It didn't take me about 10 seconds. And I got to think about it. I was standing right here and that person was standing right there and ain't here no more. They said, "You know, you used to dance a whole lot more when you was out there in the world." I sit there and I thought about it for 10 seconds. You know what I did? I took off dancing. I danced all the way down that aisle. Well, it would been an aisle right here then. I danced all the WAY AROUND THAT AISLE. I DANCED ALL THE WAY DOWN HERE. I danced all the way up around there. And I got so drunk ON THE HOLY GHOST, I COULDN'T HELP from dancing. AND I GOT TO THINKING ABOUT THAT. I GOT TO THINKING ABOUT IT. IF I COULD GO OUT THERE AND I COULD DANCE FOR THE DEVIL OUT THERE ON HIS TERMS, HOW MUCH MORE COULD I DANCE WHEN I'VE BEEN RESTORED BACK TO TRUE FAITH? WHEN I GOT REAL WORSHIP, WHEN I GOT A REAL SOUL AFTER THE HEART OF GOD? SOME DEVIL DIDN'T GIVE ME A HEART TO WORSHIP? SOME DEVIL DIDN'T GIVE ME A HEART TO DANCE. SO DON'T LET SOME DEVIL PUT THAT IN YOUR MIND. WELL, YOU USED TO DO THIS AND YOU USED TO DO THAT. DO SOMETHING NOW. &gt;&gt; I COULD POINT IT ALL OF YOUR LIFE. YOU LIVED A FORMER LIFE, BUT THOSE THINGS ARE DEAD. &gt;&gt; I ain't going to let some Hallelujah. COME ON, SOMEBODY. I COULD DANCE OUT THERE TO 50 CENT. I COULD DANCE OUT THERE TO TUPAC. I CAN I CAN SURELY DANCE TO CHARITY GALE. I CAN SURELY DANCE TO THINGS THAT ARE TO BE. I CAN SURELY DANCE TO THE RAPTURE. I CAN SURELY DANCE TO TRUE WORSHIP OF GOD'S CHOSEN PLACE OF WORSHIP. You know, the prophet thought about it, too. He really did. He thought about it, Brother Timmy, when them women got in there and they got to singing that old song, there's going to be a meeting in the air. You remember what the prophets, and now it's a prophet, he said, they're going to turn my church into a tavern. And he said, I began to think about that. He said, "But where did dancing originate at?" He said, "I got to studying it out in my mind." And he said, "I got to figuring," he said, "dancing originated in the Bible." He said, "So instead of being there in the seat of the scornful," he said, "Before long," he said, "my old Methodist foot got the patent." I had something about a prophet. He's real true, ain't he? He tells the truth. He he's sitting there in the seat of the scorn when he said all of a sudden he said I got to thinking about that thing. He said dancing originated in the Bible. So whatever it originated in THE BIBLE THEN SATAN COME IN THERE AND TRIED TO DESTROY IT. BUT GOD SAID I WILL RESTORE. BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID I WAS SITTING IN THE SEAT OF A SCORN FOR ONE SECOND. HE SAID THE NEXT MINUTE HE SAID I WAS OUT THERE DANCING A JIG with him. HALLELUJAH. I'M THANKFUL FOR THIS MESSAGE BECAUSE I REALIZE THIS. IT PUT THE LEAF BACK ON THE TREE AGAIN. I will restore. WHAT DID THAT BIBLE WHAT DID THE BIBLE SAY ABOUT THIS PALORM? It come in there and took faith right out of the word. It stripped away their faith to make them doubt it. It ate away the church's true absolute trust in God's word. But faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. The word of God shall stand forever. I will restore. The word of God is sharper, quicker than a two-edged sword. I will restore. Where did you get this true Christian joy at? Where did you get it at? I remember hearing Certain people say, "I always love coming to brother Homer's church." Get that right, sis. Always love coming to Brother Homer's church. Full of joy. You just knew that the Lord was really had a spirit of liberty in that church. I know good and well people come here just to just to watch us dance. We had a couple come here not too long ago and said, "We just wanted to see if it was real or not." Well, they found out it was real. We not We may not be the prettiest of Christians. And we may not be the most educated Christians, but we're real. &gt;&gt; We're real. They come and watch us dance. But who gave us that dance? Who gave us that joy, Brother Doug? If it come from God, then we ought to be able to enforce our rights. The joy of salvation was stripped away from the church. And I I want to implant this because I I got a lot of scriptures right here I'm about to drop to you, but I want to implant this to your mind that when God puts something on your heart to do it, you do it. And don't let no devil sit there and tell you not to do it. Is that okay? So if God give you joy, then don't let some devil try to rob it from you. Joy of salvation, heartfelt joy. Brother Brandon said, he said it was stripped away from the church and it left the church icy, cold, dead, like a morg. You ever been in a morg? Personally ain't, but I've been in some churches that look like it. &gt;&gt; Scare you to death. I one time one time my tiny got to going to a church and uh anybody don't know who Matini is? my That's my grandma. She didn't want to be called grandma. Her name was Christine, so we called her Papa called her Christini, so we called her Tiny. And Tiny, man, I tell you what, Tiny was a powerful little lady. She She is She's big as a bowling ball, but boy, she's powerful. And she could she's one of them she's one of them real quiet prayers. And boy, I tell you what, you could feel her praying across the W. It wasn't one thing that happened at 4848 Pilot Road, Pilot, Virginia. We going to start out the morning in prayer. And papa didn't care if you was in the middle of conversation. You was going to drop to your knees right there in prayer. I I remember one time Gabriel brought Gabriel brought a friend right over church uh right before church and we we sitting there and all of a sudden we're just having full-on conversation. Papa says it's time to pray. Well, praise God. Let's pray. Brother Brandham said there's too many things we could do. We could do a whole lot of this. He said, "But we can never pray too much." Well, that was one thing for sure that papa believed in was prayer. But Tiny Tiny was that kind of prayer. Papa, you could hear him. You could hear him. We always walk back to the back side of Papa's property. It wasn't that far, but it was 30 acres and walking with walking with your papa when you're a little bit 8-year-old boy walking to the back of 30 acres. You figured out that's a long way back there. And uh we'd walk back there and you could hear papa praying on the back side of that hills. It just echoed out. I I I know because one time I fell in the creek back there and you can you can hear it for a long ways away. And uh we was back there and you could hear Pawpa praying all the way on the back side of that that property. But Tini was that kind of prayer. She'd pray real quiet. Boy, you could feel her, man. You just she just rolled that neck right in bowling ball. She she full on praying. Boy, you could feel it. And all of a sudden, the spirit of God get on her and she'd just get to shouting. She'd just shout right there. She'd be sitting there at the kitchen table. Right across from her was biscuits and gravies and praise God, the Holy Ghost come there. She'd get to shouting, speaking in tongues. And she was just a real Christian. I I always aspired. There's a lot of people that want to be like some people, but if I could ever been like my teeny that's what I wanted to be. She was just she was real. Brother Wayne Lawson said he said he said when I he said, "Oh, I met brother Charlie." He said, "Huh, I don't know about I don't know about this." He said, "Then I met your deie." He said, "Well, that's where Ron gets that loving spirit from." But Tenie was just she was just real. I mean, if you never got the pre uh the the honor to meet her, you'd you'd absolutely love her. If you you never got to met her, you met Brother Ron, you met Matini. And so, but she was at this church and I tell you, she she never do anything to offend anybody. But she got to she got to sit in her and the message of the hour come across her life and spirit of God just didn't move on her. She got to dance and just dance out there right out there and she got to dancing, speaking in tongues. And the deacon of the message church come over and put tapped her on the shoulder, put her back in her seat. Well, the message kept on preaching. Thank God that wasn't around here. We' done had some deacons carry that deacon out. That's some authoritative word right there. But she got the spirit of God got to move on her again. She got back up and she did exactly what brother Brandham said in the message. She got to dancing and the deacon come up here and tapped her on the shoulder and told her to go sit down. She said, "I can't. The Holy Ghost on me." Said, "Well, you didn't get that here. God have mercy. That's a morg if I ever seen one. You know what? That was the last time they went there. But you realize how Satan hates for you to have joy. He hates for you to be happy. He hates for you to enjoy going to church. I don't know about you, but the best part of my life has been being a Christian. I'll just be real honest with you. I has a whole lot of stuff. And I did. Me and me and Sister Mary and Matthew one time we we was out there and she talked me into digging in the dumpster for some potato chips. And you thought that was the best part of my life doing something stupid. And that absolutely wasn't. But brother Matthew, I was in the dumpster the other day jumping down in there and he took a picture of me and he said, "Old habits die hard." But the best part of my life has been serving the Lord. The best part of my life has been raising my children up and rearing them up in the message of the hour. And then the enemy wants to come in there and tell you that it ain't for your children. He's What is he doing? He's trying to steal the joy of motherhood and fatherhood right out of you when you ought to be it ought to be your greatest honor to teach them the message of the hour. And there's one thing ABOUT CHILDREN IS THEY LOVE TO hear about the message, especially when it's bedtime. They don't WANT TO GO TO SLEEP AND THEY WANT YOU TO break down serpent seed. And the seventh seal right before bedtime. You know, I'm I'm just being real honest with you. They That's what Satan is wanting to do. He's wanting to steal that away from our parents is where they scared to tell about the truth. They're scared that they're they're not going to say something right. They're scared. Well, you know, you better just listen to it FOR YOURSELF. NO, MAMA. IT'S YOUR JOB TO TEACH THEM. IT'S YOUR JOY TO TEACH THEM. It's your peace TO TEACH THEM. HE OUGHT TO HAVE ENOUGH FAITH THAT GOD SAVED YOU FROM A A SINNER'S GRAVE THAT YOU OUGHT TO HAVE ENOUGH JOY TO SAY, "YOU KNOW WHAT? I MAY NOT HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS, BUT I CAN TELL YOU THERE IS A GOD THAT HAS ALL THE ANSWERS." SO IF SATAN IS COMING IN THERE AFTER YOUR JOY, GOD SAID, "I WILL RESTORE." &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "RESTORE UNTO ME THE JOY OF THY SALVATION, AND UPHOLD ME WITH THY FREE SPIRIT." ROMANS 14:17, "THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS NOT MEAT AND DRINK, BUT RIGHTEOUSNESS AND PEACE AND JOY IN THE HOLY GHOST." PETER SAID, "IT'S JOY UNSPEAKABLE AND FULL OF GLORY. Psalms 35:9, "My soul shall be joyful in THE LORD. IT SHALL REJOICE IN HIS SALVATIONS." ISAIAH 49-13, "SING, O HEAVENS, AND BE JOYFUL, O EARTH, AND BREAK FORTH INTO SINGING, OH MOUNTAINS, FOR THE LORD HATH COMFORTED HIS PEOPLE, AND WILL HAVE MERCY UPON HIS AFFLICTED." BELIEVER, do you have your joy shoes on? Now look at this caterpillar. Brother Brandham described it as a sucker. He said it gets right down. He used the word the pulp, the heart of the tree. And he said that that bug, that caterpillar goes after the life. It goes after the spirit. He said that bug represents the denomination. And he said that bug come in there and it sucked the very life of the spirit out of the tree. He said it left it as a corpse. You said there's a lot of people that walk by this bride tree. There's a lot. There's a lot of people that walk by this bride tree and they had their perspectives on it. Said she'll never be nothing. He'll never be nothing. It's dead. They don't know the story behind it. Maybe that tree was struck down by lightning or maybe it's dead and it just got no abilities. And maybe we don't know really know what happened, but they got their perspectives about you. They got their ideas about you. There's a lot of people that walk by you. But the owner of the orchard walked by. Hallelujah. And he looked at that same tree. He looked at it and it was dead. He looked at it, it had no life. He looked at it and the bark was gone. He looked at it and there was no there was no leaves on it. But he did something that the rest of the people didn't do. He got down and started digging around the roots of it. And he started opening up and he started pouring in water and he started pouring in he started pouring in attributes of himself right into that tree. And before long, he poured in justification. Under Luther's message, he poured in justification and it started coming back to life. He started coming in and wrestling. He started pouring in. He started pouring in sanctification and it started coming alive because he is the owner of this tree. &gt;&gt; HE KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT IT TAKES to make her come to life again. He dug a little deeper and he started pouring in the restoration of gifts. And boy, it sure looked like the real thing again. It sure like the red look sure looked like a bride tree to him to a lot of people. But the owner of the orchard knew that it needed one more thing. It needed the owner. IT NEEDED THE OWNER OF THE ORCHARD. IT NEEDED HIS OWN LIFE. SO THE WORD BECAME THE WORD AND IT POURED ITSELF RIGHT BACK IN THAT TREE. WHAT WAS IT? IT WAS FOUR BUGS. IT WAS FOUR BUGS. IT WAS THE SAME BUG AND IT ATE IT DOWN. BUT IT WAS FOUR MESSENGERS OF RESTORATION THAT PUT LIFE BACK IN THE CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD. SON OF MAN, WATCH WHAT BROTHER BENHAM DOES IN RESTORATION OF THE BRRIER. HE SAID IT WAS FOUR MESSENGERS OF DEATH. HE SAID, "BUT NOW IT'S FOUR MESSENGERS OF LIFE." HE SAID, "BUT SON OF MAN, CAN THESE BONES LIVE AGAIN?" &gt;&gt; I SAY, "SATAN, TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF OF GOD'S PROPERTY." &gt;&gt; What did MOSES DO? HE WENT DOWN THERE BEFORE PHARAOH. HE SAID, "YOU LET MY PEOPLE GO. LET THEM GO. LET THEM GO." EVERY PLAGUE WAS GOD'S LAW. Let my people, what is it? Turn to Isaiah 59-19, please. There's a lot of people that's looked at your life He wrote you off. There's a lot of people that looked at you and he saw dirty waters, but God saw clear waters. One brother man knew when he takes us to Zechariah 14 and said that it shall be light about the evening time. He said, "The same light that was in the morning is the same light that's in the evening." He said, "What did the evening light return for?" He said, "To restore the church." So the light has the same abilities. Notice what he said. So shall they fear the name of the Lord from the west and his glory from the rising of the sun. WHEN THE ENEMY SHALL COME IN like a flood, the spirit of the Lord shall raise up a standard against him. WHO IS THAT HIM? IT IS THAT OLD DEVIL THAT'S TRIED TO COME IN THERE AND STEAL YOUR JOY AND STEAL YOUR PEACE AND STEAL YOUR DOCTRINE AND STEAL YOUR ABSOLUTE AND STEAL YOUR GOD AND STEAL WHAT YOU'VE BEEN RIGHTFULLY GIVEN. BUT WHEN THE SPIRIT OF THE ENEMY COMES IN THERE, THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD RAISES UP A STANDARD AGAINST IT. WHAT IS THAT STANDARD? IT'S THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. NOW, you know, I I'm done. I'm completely done. Not done with assault. I'm not done with I will restore, but I'm done for today. As your musicians come, you know good and well what's been taken from you, David. You know what the enemy has taken from you. There it is. You know what he's taken from you. You know what he's robbed away from you? David, it's time to go down to Ziglad and take what's rightfully yours. Matt, would you mind singing that for us? There's somebody that's going to control that spirit. Let's have some joy. Let's have some worship. Let's have some peace. Let's have our anointing. Let's have what is rightfully ours. Amen. God bless you. Well, I'm taking it back. Everything that the devil stole from me. Well, I'm taking it back. Everything that the devil stole from me. Taking back my soul, my taste, my joy, and my peace. I'm taking it back.

Taking back my soul, my pain, my joy, and my peace. I'm taking it back. Everything that the devil stole from me. Now one day, oh king David came home from the city calls it lie. And while he was gone, the enemy came stole everything that he had. Oh, but David encouraged himself to the Lord. He made up in his mind. He said, "I'm on my way down to his king and I'm taking my property back. I'm taking it back. Everything that the devil stole from me, I'm taking it back. Everything that the devil stole me. Taking back my soul, my taste, my joy, and my peace. I'm taking it back. Everything that the devil stole me. Now we all know what Satan only comes. Steal to kill and destroy. And I must admit, there's been some times that he's taken away my joy. Oh, but I'm certainly noticing the devil today. His kingdom is under attack. Cuz I'm on my way down to his king. And I'm taking my property back. I'm taking it back. Everything that the devil stole from me, I'm taking it back. Everything that the devil stole from me, taking back my sorrow, my tears, my joy, and my peace, I'm taking it back. Everything that the devil, let's sing that second verse again. Oh, we all know Satan only comes to steal, to kill, and destroy him. Oh, and I must admit, there's been some times he's taken away my joy. Oh, I'm serving notice on the devil today. His kingdom is under attack. Cuz I'm a one my way down to his camp. And I'm taking my property back. But I'm taking it back. Everything that the devil stole of me, I'm taking it back. Ever clean that the devil restore me. Taking back my soul, my pain, my joy, my peace. I'm taking it back. Everything that Oh, let's sing and take back what's yours. Everything that the devil stole from me, I'm taking it back. Everything that the devil stole from me. Taking back my soul, my taste, my joy, my peace. I'mma take it back. Everything that the devil stole from me. Oh, give the Lord praise in the house of God this morning. Aren't you thankful that he will restore it unto you? Let's sing that song.
