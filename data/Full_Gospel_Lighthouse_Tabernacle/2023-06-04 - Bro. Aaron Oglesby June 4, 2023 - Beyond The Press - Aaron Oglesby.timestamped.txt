[55:14] in the first verse and as you're turning
[55:17] I'd just like to take the opportunity
[55:19] once again to to tell you how wonderful
[55:22] it is to be with y'all and and how
[55:24] thankful I am for the for the friendship
[55:26] and the opportunity from with brother
[55:28] Ron and then and the Spencer family they
[55:30] they mean so very much to us and and I'd
[55:33] like to bring greetings to you as well
[55:35] this morning from my pastor brother Tim
[55:37] and the church there at home evening
[55:39] like Tabernacle and y'all y'all are
[55:42] truly are a sister Church to us it's uh
[55:45] we love y'all very much and we
[55:47] appreciate you and just we're thankful
[55:49] to be associated with you amen amen and
[55:53] we're going to turn now to Luke 19 the
[55:55] first verse and
[55:57] and it says and Jesus entered and passed
[55:59] through Jericho
[56:01] and behold there was a man named
[56:03] Zacchaeus which was the chief among the
[56:06] publicans and he was rich
[56:08] and he sought to see Jesus who he was
[56:11] and could not for the Press because he
[56:15] was little of stature and he ran before
[56:18] and climbed up into a sycamore tree to
[56:21] see him for he was to pass that way
[56:23] and when Jesus came to the place he
[56:25] looked up and saw him and said unto him
[56:28] Zacchaeus make haste and come down for
[56:31] today I must abide at thy house and he
[56:34] made haste and came down and received
[56:36] him joyfully and when they saw it they
[56:39] all murmured saying that he was gone to
[56:41] be guessed with a man that is a sinner
[56:44] and Zacchaeus stood and said unto the
[56:46] Lord behold Lord
[56:48] the half of my goods I give to the poor
[56:50] and if I have taken anything from any
[56:52] man by false accusation I restore him
[56:55] fourfold and Jesus said unto him this
[56:59] day is salvation come to this house for
[57:03] so much as he also is a son of Abraham
[57:06] for the son of man has come to seek and
[57:10] to save that which was lost amen you may
[57:15] have your seats this morning I'm so
[57:17] thankful
[57:18] that he came to seek and to save that
[57:21] which was lost and and that even here in
[57:23] the in the end time and I know we we
[57:27] have a wonderful message and we we dive
[57:29] into the delps of it and there's
[57:31] wonderful Mysteries and and we're so
[57:33] thankful for all those things and the
[57:34] restoration of the word but may we never
[57:36] lose sight of the fact that it's all for
[57:39] him seeking and saving those that are
[57:42] lost and and bringing those that are his
[57:44] back unto himself and
[57:46] what we find here in this story is is
[57:49] like with all men and and all women
[57:52] Zacchaeus faces obstacles and hindrances
[57:55] in his quest to get to Jesus I believe
[57:59] all of us can attest today that life
[58:00] isn't always easy and that there are
[58:02] real battles and that there are real
[58:04] struggles that we all face each and
[58:06] every day and it seems like life is a is
[58:08] a constant struggle and a constant
[58:10] battle we dealt with some of that last
[58:12] night it seems like that one battle
[58:14] leads you not to a time of Peace but it
[58:17] leads you directly into the next battle
[58:19] and and from that battle we go into the
[58:22] next battle and there isn't much time
[58:24] for us to to sit around and celebrate
[58:26] the victories that we win because before
[58:29] we know it we're right back into the
[58:31] very next battle it it seems like just
[58:34] as things begin to settle down and you
[58:35] think you have a moment to breathe the
[58:38] next assault is on its way or or the
[58:40] next wave comes crashing down over your
[58:43] boat now I'm sure that's how job must
[58:45] have felt when when his life began to
[58:47] fall apart and it began to crumble he
[58:49] lost his property and and then all this
[58:51] is bad how much worse could it get and
[58:53] then he loses his children and then you
[58:55] know his body's attacked and then his
[58:57] wife doesn't didn't support him and then
[58:59] his friends came and attacked him it was
[59:01] just one thing right after another wave
[59:04] after a wave attack after attack and yet
[59:06] through all of that it was in that that
[59:09] job caught a vision and it's in the
[59:12] midst of this battle and it's through
[59:13] this struggle he catches a vision of one
[59:16] that's coming and he says I know my
[59:19] redeemer liveth and he says though the
[59:22] skin worms destroyed this body yet in my
[59:24] flesh I shall see God so what I'm hoping
[59:28] for this morning what I want to
[59:30] encourage you this morning is in the
[59:31] middle of your struggle in the middle of
[59:34] the battle you find yourself in the day
[59:35] look for Jesus look around and recognize
[59:39] I'm gonna be victorious in this I'm
[59:41] gonna see God move on the scene in
[59:43] whatever situation that I'm in because
[59:46] unlike those that have no hope unlike
[59:49] those that are tossed about on the sea
[59:51] of life this morning church he's in our
[59:53] boat and because he's in our boat we're
[59:55] going to Crest every wave we're going to
[59:57] be victorious in every situation we are
[1:00:00] not going to find ourselves defeated you
[1:00:02] may have a day where you feel defeated
[1:00:04] you may have moments where you feel
[1:00:06] defeated but in the end you are going to
[1:00:09] be victorious amen because we have a
[1:00:12] captain we're going to win
[1:00:15] you know just for a moment why don't we
[1:00:17] stop just for a moment before we get
[1:00:18] going and let's remind the devil of of
[1:00:21] who the winner is
[1:00:23] and who the loser is wherever you're at
[1:00:26] today however you're feeling I want you
[1:00:28] to know you win and Satan I'd like you
[1:00:31] to know today that you are a loser you
[1:00:34] have been losing from the beginning of
[1:00:35] time and you're going to lose again
[1:00:37] because I'm the winner and there's only
[1:00:39] room for one of us so remind him today
[1:00:42] who the winner is and who the loser is
[1:00:45] amen listen strong winds are blowing
[1:00:47] strong winds are blowing from every side
[1:00:49] that the enemy's attacking the brides
[1:00:52] being attacked your family's being
[1:00:53] attacked your body may be being an
[1:00:56] attack but I must stand once again in
[1:00:58] reminding brother Ron it's going to take
[1:01:00] a stronger win than this because we are
[1:01:04] determined we are anchored we are going
[1:01:06] forward in the word listen we will
[1:01:08] rapture we will overcome we're not
[1:01:11] stopping your winds can blow but it's
[1:01:13] gonna take a stronger win than this to
[1:01:16] keep us from our promises amen
[1:01:20] hey man it doesn't matter who comes
[1:01:22] comes against it doesn't matter what
[1:01:25] comes against this morning we're
[1:01:27] determined that we're going to get to
[1:01:29] Jesus
[1:01:30] hey man I want to speak to you today on
[1:01:32] Beyond The Press
[1:01:34] Beyond The Press
[1:01:37] this account that that we read in Luke
[1:01:40] is the final trip of Jesus's life
[1:01:45] this is the same trip
[1:01:48] um where he's coming through Jericho
[1:01:49] where Bartimaeus is healed this is the
[1:01:52] this is leading up to the very final
[1:01:55] week of his life and it's in the very
[1:01:57] next chapter or it's actually in this
[1:01:59] very chapter that we read of his entry
[1:02:02] into Jerusalem
[1:02:03] and the people are shouting and they're
[1:02:06] praising and they're laying out their
[1:02:07] garments before him and he's riding in
[1:02:09] on a coat and and and and here it's only
[1:02:12] days before
[1:02:15] days before is crucifixion and his mind
[1:02:18] is already turned and set on Calvary
[1:02:22] and this man named Zacchaeus begins to
[1:02:24] desire to see him
[1:02:26] he begins to desire to see this Jesus
[1:02:29] for himself
[1:02:30] now I want you to know that these things
[1:02:32] don't happen by accident
[1:02:34] these things don't just happen on their
[1:02:36] own it isn't happenstance when someone
[1:02:39] begins to long for and desire God when
[1:02:43] that happens God Is On The Move listen
[1:02:45] that feeling on the inside of your heart
[1:02:47] that tug on the inside of your heart
[1:02:49] that isn't just you that isn't some just
[1:02:52] some funny feeling if God's moving in
[1:02:54] your heart this morning respond to it
[1:02:56] that's God calling you that's God Jordan
[1:02:59] it's not just some accident that you're
[1:03:01] sitting here this morning but God is on
[1:03:04] the move and he begins to pull and tug
[1:03:07] on your heart and and he's going about
[1:03:10] Gathering the last few ones what we're
[1:03:13] seeing here is the last moments of his
[1:03:15] life
[1:03:16] and here we are in the last moments of
[1:03:18] time as time is closing and he's going
[1:03:20] about seeking to save those that which
[1:03:23] were lost
[1:03:24] brother Branham says that his wife had
[1:03:27] been praying for him
[1:03:28] she says she is a Believer on the Lord
[1:03:31] Jesus and she'd been praying for her
[1:03:33] husband a businessman of the city to
[1:03:35] become a follower of the Lord Jesus and
[1:03:37] you know conviction can make you very
[1:03:40] restless it does that and so a good
[1:03:44] Praying Wife or mother can do more for
[1:03:47] the kingdom of God on her knees at home
[1:03:49] than sometimes the preacher can do on
[1:03:52] the platform
[1:03:54] listen mom listen Dad don't let him
[1:03:58] hinder your prayers by making you think
[1:04:00] it's insignificant it's working it's
[1:04:03] moving it's going after that lost loved
[1:04:06] when it's going after that son or
[1:04:07] daughter and your prayers may do more
[1:04:09] than hundreds of sermons across this
[1:04:12] Pulpit don't you quit praying don't you
[1:04:15] give up don't you back off where you've
[1:04:17] been standing you keep calling out to
[1:04:19] God you keep crying out to God you can
[1:04:22] well I prayed and I prayed and I prayed
[1:04:25] and nothing's changed don't ever ever
[1:04:27] let that be your testimony you testify
[1:04:30] the finished work I prayed and it's
[1:04:33] finished I prayed and they're coming
[1:04:35] back I prayed and he's healed I prayed
[1:04:38] and the Holy Ghost it's on its way you
[1:04:40] say well I don't want to testify of
[1:04:42] Allah it can't be a lie if it's the word
[1:04:45] of God the word of God says you're
[1:04:47] healed the word of God says that you'll
[1:04:49] be there that your Offspring will be
[1:04:51] there it's not a lie just testify about
[1:04:54] what he said
[1:04:56] just testifying to finish work
[1:05:01] you're not testifying of what you feel
[1:05:03] you're not testifying of what you see
[1:05:07] you're testifying of what the word says
[1:05:09] amen
[1:05:10] it's not a lie when it's the word of God
[1:05:13] get your eyes off the press
[1:05:16] get your eyes off the situation and off
[1:05:19] of your current condition and in the
[1:05:21] current circumstances that are hindering
[1:05:23] you
[1:05:24] Focus Beyond this hardship
[1:05:27] Focus look Beyond this failure
[1:05:30] because what those things are is just a
[1:05:32] press
[1:05:35] the Press is the hindrances and the
[1:05:38] hardships and the battles that try to
[1:05:40] keep you from getting to your full
[1:05:43] inheritance they try to keep you from
[1:05:46] your encounter they try to keep you from
[1:05:49] your moment in his presence
[1:05:51] but it's just beyond the Press
[1:05:54] it's just beyond the Press it's just
[1:05:57] beyond this trial just beyond this
[1:05:59] sickness just beyond the things trying
[1:06:02] to keep you from getting there just
[1:06:03] beyond that is where Jesus is
[1:06:07] just beyond where you're standing today
[1:06:09] where you see no hope there is your
[1:06:11] deliverance
[1:06:12] just beyond today when the sickest of
[1:06:15] days there is your healing
[1:06:17] just beyond it today where you fill off
[1:06:19] backswing so far and I can never come
[1:06:21] back to God there he stands just right
[1:06:24] there waiting on you
[1:06:26] just beyond the Press
[1:06:28] but there's a part you have to play
[1:06:31] you have to be willing to press
[1:06:34] you've got to be willing to go in and
[1:06:37] not be hindered by every little thing
[1:06:39] sure it's going to be tough sure it's
[1:06:41] going to be a hindrance Zacchaeus
[1:06:43] couldn't see anything he wanted to get
[1:06:46] to Jesus there's always going to be
[1:06:47] something there to stop you from your
[1:06:49] encounter but do you turn around and go
[1:06:51] home empty today do you turn around and
[1:06:54] go home to feed it today or today do you
[1:06:56] say no sir I'm gonna enter in I'm going
[1:06:58] to push through I'm going to fight
[1:07:00] through I'm gonna get to Jesus today in
[1:07:03] this service
[1:07:08] Luke 19 1
[1:07:10] are open in scripture we're gonna go
[1:07:12] through this for just a minute
[1:07:13] and Jesus entered and passed through
[1:07:15] Jericho
[1:07:16] and behold there was a man named
[1:07:18] Zacchaeus which was the chief among the
[1:07:21] publicans
[1:07:23] and he was rich
[1:07:27] Zacchaeus Was A Publican or a tax
[1:07:30] collector
[1:07:32] and not just any old tax collector
[1:07:35] he was the chief
[1:07:37] he was the boss of the tax collectors in
[1:07:40] Jericho
[1:07:42] and Jericho was known for the trade and
[1:07:45] the selling of what's known as Balsam
[1:07:47] it was known throughout the ancient
[1:07:49] world for its medicinal use and its rare
[1:07:52] perfumes it was the most economically
[1:07:55] significant plant of all ancient times
[1:07:59] why do you tell us all that because it
[1:08:02] brought in lots and lots and lots of
[1:08:04] money which created lots and lots and
[1:08:07] lots of taxes which shows us that
[1:08:10] Zacchaeus Was very very very rich
[1:08:13] and he was hated because he gained his
[1:08:16] wealth not because of his job per se not
[1:08:19] the pay that the Romans gave him but
[1:08:21] because he taxed his people more than
[1:08:25] even what the Romans did so that he
[1:08:28] could skim off the top and line his own
[1:08:30] pockets
[1:08:32] now
[1:08:33] can you kind of understand a little bit
[1:08:35] why when Jesus stopped to talk to him
[1:08:39] the people didn't like it so much
[1:08:43] I've been stealing your money every day
[1:08:45] and you know it and there's nothing you
[1:08:46] can do about it
[1:08:48] you were poor and you are struggling and
[1:08:50] you can't pay your bills and I'm rich
[1:08:52] and who's Jesus stopped to talk to
[1:08:54] me
[1:08:56] it kind of puts you in a little bit of
[1:08:58] an understanding of why there was a
[1:08:59] frustration
[1:09:00] are you serious of all these people and
[1:09:03] this one over here I mean you know the
[1:09:05] life they lived and they're they're good
[1:09:06] people and they're struggling and when
[1:09:08] they could sure use a visitation from
[1:09:09] Jesus today nope Zacchaeus
[1:09:14] think about it now he he goes to
[1:09:17] Zacchaeus and he is absolutely hated
[1:09:20] verse 3. and he sought to seek Jesus who
[1:09:24] he was
[1:09:25] and could not for the Press because he
[1:09:28] was little of stature
[1:09:32] you know Zacchaeus had a lot of things
[1:09:33] working against him that day
[1:09:35] things that had probably hindered him
[1:09:37] his whole life
[1:09:39] things that he had battled against and
[1:09:42] Ward against his entire life
[1:09:44] complexes that had built up
[1:09:47] over time
[1:09:51] you know complexes may not seem like
[1:09:53] that big a deal to you
[1:09:55] and mind battles may not seem like that
[1:09:58] big a deal to you because it may not be
[1:10:01] where you fight
[1:10:02] it may not be where you were let me put
[1:10:06] it to you like this just for a little
[1:10:07] silly illustration I wouldn't have had a
[1:10:10] hard time seeing Jesus that day
[1:10:15] it wouldn't have been my battle
[1:10:19] but to Zacchaeus it was the biggest
[1:10:21] battle in his life at that moment
[1:10:26] sometimes you may not understand what
[1:10:28] somebody's going through but that don't
[1:10:29] mean it ain't very real that don't mean
[1:10:32] it ain't a very tough battle that don't
[1:10:34] mean they don't need you to pray for
[1:10:36] them it may be it may seem simple to you
[1:10:38] but listen I want you to know if you're
[1:10:40] in the battle with a complex or a mind
[1:10:42] battle I'm not looking at it going get
[1:10:45] over your complexes I understand they're
[1:10:47] real but I also want you to know that
[1:10:49] you can be set free that you were
[1:10:51] fearfully and wonderfully made that God
[1:10:53] doesn't view you through that complex
[1:10:55] you can rise above that thing quit
[1:10:57] worrying about what this one thinks and
[1:10:59] that one thinks this one says you're a
[1:11:01] Son of God this one says you're a
[1:11:03] daughter of God this one says you're
[1:11:05] gonna make it this one calls you a
[1:11:07] mighty man of Valor
[1:11:10] complexes are real
[1:11:14] it real struggles they're real battles
[1:11:18] to the tall guy the Press wasn't an
[1:11:20] issue at all
[1:11:22] it wasn't an issue at all for him to see
[1:11:24] Jesus it wasn't his battle but to
[1:11:27] Zacchaeus because of the press he could
[1:11:30] not see Jesus
[1:11:34] but he didn't let it stop him
[1:11:36] that's what I'm trying to get to you
[1:11:38] today it didn't let him stop him Luke 19
[1:11:41] and 4 and he ran before I tell you what
[1:11:44] apparently it's okay to run if it means
[1:11:47] you're trying to get to Jesus apparently
[1:11:49] it's okay to get a little loose and get
[1:11:52] to running if it's trying to get to the
[1:11:54] kids said I don't care what they think I
[1:11:56] don't care what I got to do if I got to

[1:12:07] into a sycamore tree to see him for he
[1:12:10] was to pass that way I'm so thankful
[1:12:14] that there's something on the inside of
[1:12:16] us when Satan puts up a roadblock here

[1:12:20] throws this up we don't go oh well I

[1:13:35] says I gotta find a way to him
[1:13:38] I gotta get to him today
[1:13:40] it's a blessed desire
[1:13:42] I must

[1:13:49] and had no desire to see Jesus
[1:13:55] the blessing

[1:14:33] into church just perfect and their
[1:14:35] family walks in just perfect and they
[1:14:37] all look the part but when it comes
[1:14:39] right down to it they won't go down in
[1:14:41] the valley and face the giant that's
[1:14:43] down there stealing everything from them
[1:14:45] taking their kids robbing their home
[1:14:47] destroying it may look perfect on the
[1:14:49] outside they may look good on the
[1:14:51] outside but they don't have what you
[1:14:52] have on the inside something that'll
[1:14:55] take you down in the valley something

[1:15:22] going to cut his head off you're the one
[1:15:23] that presses through when others quit

[1:17:11] got such a stigma that people are afraid
[1:17:13] to come there and worship
[1:17:15] I heard a man say one time that that I
[1:17:17] took a shower last week
[1:17:21] but I'll probably need another one this
[1:17:23] week too
[1:17:25] it's okay to come down here and clean up
[1:17:27] every now and again pour things out
[1:17:29] listen the altar is a place of worship

[1:18:31] Hallelujah
[1:18:33] but you got to press through to get it
[1:18:39] Hallelujah he's right there Beyond The
[1:18:42] Press
[1:18:43] he's right there
[1:18:45] brother Brown says if the Holy Spirit if
[1:18:48] Jesus Christ proves that he's here Among
[1:18:50] Us then press till you get to him
[1:18:53] like the little woman with the blood
[1:18:55] issue and all of the different things
[1:18:56] that take in place in all the
[1:18:58] adversaries in her way she just pressed
[1:19:01] right on through until she touched him
[1:19:05] he says oh it's true she had many
[1:19:07] hindrances but her faith didn't have any
[1:19:09] hindrances you might have some I've got
[1:19:12] plenty of them a lot of hindrances but
[1:19:15] about your faith that's the thing if you
[1:19:18] can't be persistent if you're going to
[1:19:20] let everything hinder you he says now
[1:19:22] physically you might feel bad physically
[1:19:25] you might not feel well and otherwise
[1:19:27] you might not feel like going to church
[1:19:30] you might not feel like doing anything
[1:19:32] but your faith don't have no hindrances
[1:19:36] it moves on anyhow
[1:19:40] when you're willing to lay that pride
[1:19:42] aside when you're willing to set fear
[1:19:44] aside when you're willing to fight
[1:19:46] through the Press I promise you he's
[1:19:48] going to meet your knee he's going to
[1:19:50] meet you there but he wants people who
[1:19:54] are willing to fight
[1:19:56] we said it last night he don't want no
[1:19:58] cowards in your foxholes
[1:20:00] he wants people that are willing to
[1:20:03] fight willing to not back down willing
[1:20:05] that when discouragement hits when the
[1:20:07] doctors report ain't what you'd hope for
[1:20:09] you say that's okay I'm still looking to
[1:20:11] this report I'm still fighting in I'm
[1:20:14] still pressing in people that are that
[1:20:16] have a backbone about them
[1:20:21] you've prayed and prayed and prayed and
[1:20:23] it seems like nothing's happened
[1:20:25] you've called for your family and your
[1:20:27] family member he's struggling he's going
[1:20:30] to die and you pray and it seems like
[1:20:31] Jesus just went further
[1:20:34] seems like you just walked away seems
[1:20:35] like your prayers ain't getting out of
[1:20:37] the building
[1:20:38] fear Whispers I'll just give up
[1:20:41] doubt begins to come in says I told you
[1:20:43] it wouldn't work
[1:20:45] I told you it wouldn't work but
[1:20:47] something on the inside of a Believer
[1:20:49] something deep down on the inside says
[1:20:51] even now
[1:20:52] even now Lord Jesus even now is there
[1:20:56] anything too hard for the Lord there is
[1:20:59] nothing too hard for the Lord there is
[1:21:02] nothing too hard for the Lord
[1:21:04] today in this presence in this place
[1:21:06] there is nothing too hard for the Lord
[1:21:08] if you're willing to stay right with it
[1:21:11] to push through push back your doubts
[1:21:13] begin to doubt your doubts be honest
[1:21:16] before God
[1:21:18] be honest like the man says Lord I
[1:21:20] believe
[1:21:21] but help my unbelief if there's anything
[1:21:24] holding me back if there's anything from
[1:21:27] keeping me from getting to you Lord help
[1:21:28] me with that help me move beyond that
[1:21:31] today
[1:21:32] your flesh always says stop
[1:21:34] sure it does your flesh will tell you to
[1:21:36] stop your symptoms will tell you to stop
[1:21:39] but your faith says forward your faith
[1:21:42] says keep going keep pressing the battle
[1:21:44] amen
[1:21:46] he says but this one thing remember this
[1:21:48] morning
[1:21:49] seek life
[1:21:51] pursue after it thirst for it just keep
[1:21:55] reaching for it don't let nothing stand
[1:21:58] in your way he says
[1:22:00] seek for it
[1:22:02] seek for that life
[1:22:04] don't let nothing stand in the way
[1:22:06] listen there's a squeeze coming against
[1:22:07] the Bride of Jesus Christ right now
[1:22:09] trying to squeeze the life out of it
[1:22:12] trying to make it cold and dead and
[1:22:14] formal trying to squeeze the life out of
[1:22:16] our services
[1:22:18] trying to keep life from springing forth
[1:22:20] trying to keep people from getting a new
[1:22:23] birth with Jesus Christ or they can talk
[1:22:25] about him but don't get to him we can
[1:22:28] preach about him but don't get to him oh
[1:22:30] no no don't be so fanatical you don't
[1:22:32] got to press through all that stuff and
[1:22:34] get to him trying to keep Jesus from
[1:22:36] being born in the hearts of those that
[1:22:38] are seeking him
[1:22:40] trying to stop the new birth brother
[1:22:41] Branham says what they're afraid of is
[1:22:44] the new birth
[1:22:45] that's the reason we got grandchildren
[1:22:48] in the church afraid of a new birth
[1:22:50] afraid of the Holy Ghost afraid of the
[1:22:54] power of God
[1:22:56] listen it's an anointing it's an attack
[1:22:58] on the anointing it's an attack on the
[1:23:01] atmosphere Twisted quotes building up a
[1:23:05] press
[1:23:06] Twisted ideas and they remove the the
[1:23:09] altar call out of the church
[1:23:11] they remove worship and spirit and Truth
[1:23:14] out of the church
[1:23:16] and what do they do and they're setting
[1:23:18] up a press to try to keep people from
[1:23:21] getting to that life
[1:23:22] listen as long as I have breath in my
[1:23:24] body I'll stand up I'll fight I'll push
[1:23:27] I'll pull and I'll say you gotta be born
[1:23:29] again you gotta get to the New Birth you
[1:23:32] got to get to Jesus for yourself I'm
[1:23:34] glad you believe the message I'm glad
[1:23:37] you've accepted it I believe the message
[1:23:39] brother and congratulations you're on
[1:23:41] the level with the Devil
[1:23:45] you've made it as far as Satan not a
[1:23:48] good place to stop because he believes
[1:23:50] and he trembles I say believe and keep
[1:23:53] going believe and get more believe and
[1:23:56] push through believe and get to Jesus
[1:23:59] believe and get born again
[1:24:02] Hallelujah
[1:24:04] Hallelujah
[1:24:06] they keep trying to put a cage on it
[1:24:09] keep trying to squeeze the lay you can't
[1:24:11] keep that eagle caged up forever
[1:24:13] eventually listen an eagle can't help
[1:24:15] but believe in the Supernatural he can't
[1:24:18] help but but go beyond the Press
[1:24:21] brother Branham said if a man is born of
[1:24:23] the spirit of God he believes in the
[1:24:25] Supernatural he can't help it because
[1:24:28] he's a son of God
[1:24:32] he said that's the reason tonight we got
[1:24:34] so many
[1:24:35] old cold formal and different God
[1:24:38] forsaken backslidden churches
[1:24:41] Lord May that never describe us
[1:24:46] he says because men and women are not
[1:24:48] born of the spirit of God they have no
[1:24:50] taste of God they don't know nothing
[1:24:52] about God and all they know is theology
[1:24:56] that's the reason you can't get them to
[1:24:59] believe a thing that's exactly right
[1:25:07] why don't people see healings
[1:25:09] why don't people see miracles
[1:25:12] why don't people see the gifts
[1:25:14] manifested
[1:25:15] well that don't happen in our church and
[1:25:17] they say it almost like a brag
[1:25:21] because there's been a press set up
[1:25:24] there's been a press set up
[1:25:26] why do you see it here because it's
[1:25:28] preached
[1:25:31] why do you not see it other places
[1:25:33] because it's not but you don't have to
[1:25:36] preach against it
[1:25:39] just don't preach it
[1:25:41] you know a lot of times I think people
[1:25:43] are going to be held accountable not for
[1:25:44] what they preach but for what they did
[1:25:46] not preach
[1:25:49] they didn't want to offer you living
[1:25:51] water they didn't want it it was just
[1:25:53] old stagnant the water listen listen
[1:25:55] through the Dark Ages the whales of
[1:25:57] Living Water were clogged up and rocks
[1:26:00] and pollution and things were put in it
[1:26:02] but a message came in this day and all
[1:26:04] of that was dug out and it was pulled
[1:26:06] out and water began to flow freely once
[1:26:09] again pure again like on the day of
[1:26:11] Pentecost just like in the first age and
[1:26:13] now people are coming and they're
[1:26:15] putting pollutants back in it they're
[1:26:16] dropping little things back in it I say
[1:26:18] I won't stand for it I want clean water
[1:26:21] I want pure water I want it just like
[1:26:23] the Bible says I wanted how the message
[1:26:25] says just preach the message and you'll
[1:26:28] preach the supernatural just preach the
[1:26:30] message and you'll believe in signs and
[1:26:33] wonders and gifts and the new birth if
[1:26:36] you preach the message that's what
[1:26:37] you'll be preaching
[1:26:41] [Applause]
[1:26:48] Mark two and one
[1:26:51] and again he entered into Capernaum
[1:26:54] after some days
[1:26:55] and it was noise that he was in the
[1:26:58] house
[1:26:59] I like that
[1:27:01] how you know he's here the noise
[1:27:06] and straightway many were gathered
[1:27:08] together and so much that there was no
[1:27:11] room to receive them
[1:27:13] no not so much as about the door and he
[1:27:16] preached the word unto them and they
[1:27:18] come unto him bringing one sick of the
[1:27:20] palsy which was born of four
[1:27:24] and when they could not come nigh unto
[1:27:26] him for the Press
[1:27:30] they told their friend we're sorry buddy
[1:27:33] you just gonna have to have the palsy
[1:27:36] days of Miracles has passed
[1:27:39] God don't do this no more
[1:27:41] we're going back home
[1:27:44] no
[1:27:45] no I don't have that I don't have that
[1:27:47] translation
[1:27:50] says when they could not come unto him
[1:27:52] for the Press they uncovered the roof
[1:27:55] where he was and when they had broken it
[1:27:57] up they let down the bed wherein the
[1:28:00] sick of the palsy lay and when Jesus saw
[1:28:03] their faith he said unto the sick of the
[1:28:06] palsy son thy sins be forgiven them
[1:28:11] listen there was so much in their way
[1:28:13] probably a lot more than was in your way
[1:28:15] getting here this morning maybe there
[1:28:17] was a little fight in the house maybe
[1:28:18] you caught too many red lights but you
[1:28:20] got here they couldn't get in they
[1:28:23] couldn't make it in they listened
[1:28:24] sometimes we just need to get a little
[1:28:26] bit unconventional and tear the roof off
[1:28:28] the place he said to listen you keep
[1:28:31] caging people up you keep keeping people
[1:28:33] from Jesus you tell them you can't
[1:28:35] worship like this and you can't worship
[1:28:37] like that you better be careful cause
[1:28:39] they're about to tear the roof off the
[1:28:42] place I'll do whatever it takes to get
[1:28:45] to Jesus I'll tear the walls down I'll
[1:28:47] rip the roof off I'm getting to Jesus I

[1:28:53] joy restored you told me I can't dance

[1:32:55] 21
[1:32:58] it says that when Jesus passed over
[1:32:59] again by ship
[1:33:01] onto the other side much people gather
[1:33:03] unto him
[1:33:04] and he was nine to the Sea
[1:33:07] and behold there cometh one of the
[1:33:08] rulers of the synagogue Jairus by name
[1:33:11] and when he saw him he fell at his feet
[1:33:14] and besought him greatly saying my
[1:33:16] little daughter life at the point of
[1:33:18] death
[1:33:19] I pray that he come and lay thy hands on
[1:33:21] her that she may be healed and she shall
[1:33:23] live
[1:33:24] and Jesus went with him and much people
[1:33:26] followed him and thronged him
[1:33:29] and a certain woman
[1:33:31] which had an issue of blood 12 years now
[1:33:34] notice this is going to tie right into
[1:33:36] what I just said
[1:33:37] this wasn't her service
[1:33:39] this was jairus's service
[1:33:43] think about it
[1:33:45] sometimes we sit there and this one's
[1:33:48] jumping and this one's shouting and
[1:33:50] you're going they're having themselves a
[1:33:51] time they're they're having a good you
[1:33:53] know we talk about it way too much in
[1:33:55] Broad terms well we had a good service
[1:33:58] today
[1:33:59] wow it was powerful there today at the
[1:34:02] Full Gospel Lighthouse wow God did some
[1:34:05] wonderful things and it's easy to do
[1:34:07] that and not make it about you
[1:34:10] did you have a good service today did
[1:34:13] you get everything out of this service
[1:34:15] that you were supposed to get I don't
[1:34:17] care if every single person in here was
[1:34:19] delivered and ran the aisles and got
[1:34:22] saved and filled with the Holy Ghost if
[1:34:24] you didn't for you that service was a
[1:34:26] failure
[1:34:31] it's about you what are you getting oh
[1:34:35] this is their service it's okay he's in
[1:34:37] the room you can have him too you can
[1:34:39] have a portion too you can have your
[1:34:41] part too there's enough of him to go
[1:34:43] around
[1:34:45] what if she didn't say well he's
[1:34:47] occupied he's already dealing with
[1:34:49] somebody's heart that's not how it works
[1:34:51] when you see him dealing with somebody's
[1:34:53] heart you say yes Lord Do It For Me deal
[1:34:56] with my heart feel my soul heal my body
[1:34:59] give me more of you just like you're
[1:35:01] doing it for them
[1:35:09] said and he said she had suffered many
[1:35:11] things of many Physicians had spent all
[1:35:14] that she had and was nothing better but
[1:35:15] rather grew worse
[1:35:17] when she heard of Jesus she came in the
[1:35:20] Press
[1:35:21] there was something keeping her from him
[1:35:24] she came in the press behind and touched
[1:35:26] His Garment for she said if I may but
[1:35:28] touch his clothes I shall be whole and
[1:35:31] straightway the Fountain of her blood
[1:35:33] was dried up she felt in her body that
[1:35:35] she was healed of that plague Jesus
[1:35:38] immediately knowing in himself that
[1:35:39] virtue had gone out of him turned about
[1:35:41] in the press and said who touched me and
[1:35:46] the disciples said unto him thou seeest
[1:35:47] the multitude thronging thee and sayeth
[1:35:49] thou who touched me he looked around to
[1:35:52] see her that had done this thing but the
[1:35:54] woman fear Him and trembling knowing
[1:35:56] what was done in her came and fell down
[1:35:58] before him and told him all the truth
[1:36:00] and here's what happens when you get
[1:36:02] through the Press
[1:36:03] and he said unto her daughter thy faith
[1:36:06] have made thee whole go in peace and be
[1:36:10] whole of that place
[1:36:12] she had every reason to quit
[1:36:15] she had every reason to turn back
[1:36:17] stop you're pushing are you pushing
[1:36:20] through the crowd for
[1:36:22] every man she had ever went to to help
[1:36:24] her had failed her

[1:36:30] supposed to be around them
[1:36:31] her family had turned her out her family
[1:36:33] wanted nothing to do with her you talk
[1:36:36] about complexes

[1:37:39] but it was their responsibility to get
[1:37:41] to him for theirselves

[1:37:45] for herself
[1:37:50] yeah

[1:41:41] I know you've seen it
[1:41:43] surely ain't just where I go
[1:41:47] I started to say my church but it's not
[1:41:49] my church
[1:41:54] a determination to get what you need
[1:41:56] will always bring results
[1:41:59] brother Brown says
[1:42:00] Christ is our Variety Store
[1:42:03] by one Spirit we're all baptized into
[1:42:05] one big Variety Store amen anything you
[1:42:09] have need of he will supply it if I need
[1:42:12] healing I'll take it if I need Joy I'll
[1:42:15] take it if I need Victory I'll take it
[1:42:18] it's all hanging around in God's big
[1:42:20] Variety Store
[1:42:22] and I'm a possession and you have a
[1:42:24] possession of everything in that Variety
[1:42:26] Store when you're baptized with the Holy
[1:42:28] Ghost Amen brother you talk about Elbow
[1:42:31] Room he said let's take over
[1:42:33] we need healing there it is sitting
[1:42:36] there for you reach over and take it you
[1:42:38] might have to kick over a few things to
[1:42:40] get to it push through a few things to
[1:42:43] get to it but go ahead and take it you
[1:42:46] might have to get a ladder and reach up
[1:42:48] for it but God's got a ladder there if
[1:42:51] you're interested in getting it
[1:42:54] who it's Out Of Reach this morning
[1:42:56] brother everything let's climb for it
[1:42:59] maybe even a sycamore tree
[1:43:01] I can't quite get to it we'll kick over
[1:43:03] whatever's in your way whatever you got
[1:43:06] to do get there push through anyway till
[1:43:09] you get it because there's always going
[1:43:11] to be a press
[1:43:13] there's always going to be things in the
[1:43:14] way
[1:43:16] but what I want to ask you right now is
[1:43:17] how desperate are you to get to Jesus
[1:43:21] how important
[1:43:23] is that moment to you
[1:43:25] how important is it what are you willing
[1:43:28] to sacrifice
[1:43:29] what are you willing to give up what are
[1:43:31] you willing to go through how important
[1:43:33] is it because I find this very
[1:43:34] interesting
[1:43:35] look in Luke 8 19.
[1:43:38] I'm going to tell you right now it don't
[1:43:40] matter who you are how long you've been
[1:43:41] in the message
[1:43:43] how long you've been saved who your
[1:43:45] daddy is who your grandpappy is don't
[1:43:47] none of that matter
[1:43:49] you can be a descendant of General
[1:43:50] Robert E Lee himself
[1:43:53] that tends to hold weight in these parts
[1:43:57] you gotta be desperate
[1:44:02] verse 19.
[1:44:03] Luke 8 19. then came to him his mother
[1:44:08] and his brethren and could not come at
[1:44:12] him
[1:44:12] for the Press
[1:44:15] his brothers
[1:44:18] his mama
[1:44:19] you don't know how it is when Mama wants
[1:44:22] to talk to you
[1:44:23] it's mama
[1:44:25] now they're thinking
[1:44:28] I'm mama
[1:44:30] and we're his brothers
[1:44:32] listen what they say
[1:44:34] and it was told him by certain which
[1:44:37] said thy mother and thy Brethren stand
[1:44:40] without
[1:44:43] Desiring to see thee
[1:44:46] uh oh
[1:44:49] mom and brothers ain't desperate enough
[1:44:54] mama and brothers think hey you know I
[1:44:56] don't want to get in with all them folks
[1:44:58] they're running and jumping and shouting
[1:45:00] here I am with my hair up I ain't losing
[1:45:02] no bobby pins today
[1:45:06] I ain't doing it
[1:45:12] y'all go tell Jesus that I'm out here
[1:45:15] waiting on it
[1:45:17] tell Jesus I'll meet him on my terms
[1:45:20] tell Jesus I need the Holy Ghost but I
[1:45:22] ain't giving this up
[1:45:26] I I I need I need a financial blessing
[1:45:30] but I ain't willing to work
[1:45:39] uh oh
[1:45:48] listen
[1:45:51] too many people think of financial
[1:45:52] blessing is I wake up and I go check my
[1:45:55] bank account
[1:45:56] and boom knew it quarter meal
[1:46:06] let me tell you what's really going to
[1:46:07] happen you keep praying for that
[1:46:09] Financial blessing and you keep not
[1:46:11] doing nothing on your end and that thing
[1:46:13] will keep saying zero
[1:46:15] and you keep crying about it and fussing
[1:46:17] about it and whining and asking for
[1:46:19] handouts but the minute you say Lord I'm
[1:46:21] willing to work I'm willing to do
[1:46:23] whatever I don't want a handout I want a
[1:46:25] job I want you to provide an opportunity
[1:46:27] I want you to do something for me and
[1:46:29] then things will start growing a little
[1:46:31] by little by little by little and you
[1:46:34] will be able to pay your bills and you
[1:46:36] will have things overflowing you gotta
[1:46:38] be willing to do your part and it goes
[1:46:41] for the same thing in healing and
[1:46:43] deliverance and salvation everything you
[1:46:46] got a part to play
[1:46:48] [Applause]
[1:46:56] bad case of the lazy artists running
[1:46:58] around
[1:47:03] and we'll move on
[1:47:06] verse 21.
[1:47:08] and he answered and said unto them my
[1:47:11] mother
[1:47:12] and my brethren
[1:47:14] are these
[1:47:16] which hear the word of God
[1:47:19] and do it
[1:47:21] in that moment because they weren't
[1:47:22] willing to Humble themselves he didn't
[1:47:24] even claim them as his own
[1:47:26] he said these are my family these people
[1:47:29] right here who've gathered who've come
[1:47:31] to hear me speak who were willing to
[1:47:32] drive however far do whatever it takes
[1:47:35] fight through whatever unbelief that's
[1:47:37] my family these are my brothers these is
[1:47:39] my mother these are the ones that I love
[1:47:41] you're not willing to do that
[1:47:46] he literally said go
[1:47:50] tell them
[1:47:52] they want in here
[1:47:54] they got to come the same way everybody
[1:47:55] else did
[1:47:57] you want in the kingdom of God you're
[1:48:00] going to come the same way everybody
[1:48:01] else did you got to repent you've got to
[1:48:03] be baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:48:05] Jesus and you got to be filled with the
[1:48:08] baptism of the Holy Ghost that's the
[1:48:11] pattern it'll always be the pattern
[1:48:12] until the end of the ages there is no
[1:48:15] other way
[1:48:18] but Zacchaeus was willing to climb
[1:48:23] Luke 19 and 5 and when Jesus came to the
[1:48:26] place he looked up and saw him and said
[1:48:27] unto him Zacchaeus make case and come
[1:48:29] now for today I must abide at the house
[1:48:33] and he made haste and came down and
[1:48:35] received him joyfully I love how Jesus
[1:48:38] comes and calls him by name calls him
[1:48:40] Zacchaeus it's the last person called by
[1:48:42] name before Jesus enters into Jerusalem
[1:48:44] it's the last name that gets called I
[1:48:46] love it how he doesn't look up there and
[1:48:48] go hey little short fella
[1:48:51] I I figure
[1:48:52] that you're probably up there because
[1:48:54] you couldn't see
[1:48:55] because you're 311.
[1:48:59] Hey listen
[1:49:00] back then everybody was shorter than we
[1:49:02] are today
[1:49:04] so for it to be mentioned in the Bible
[1:49:06] that he was little
[1:49:10] I'm not trying I'm not trying to be
[1:49:12] funny
[1:49:14] but I figured he was a door for
[1:49:16] something
[1:49:17] is that is that proper dwarf is proper
[1:49:20] time yes because everybody back then was
[1:49:23] like five foot tall
[1:49:24] and he's so short that the Bible takes
[1:49:27] time to point it out and go this man was
[1:49:29] little
[1:49:30] so and I don't say that once again to be
[1:49:32] funny but I'm telling you I figure even
[1:49:34] climbing the tree was hard
[1:49:37] we just look at it like oh he climbed
[1:49:39] the tree well you go climb a tree now do
[1:49:41] it being three foot six
[1:49:48] he was willing to fight through but
[1:49:50] listen he called him by name
[1:49:53] he calls him by name
[1:49:56] because your name was written on the
[1:49:58] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:50:01] foundation of the world I imagine he
[1:50:04] probably thought like Nathaniel did when
[1:50:05] did you know me
[1:50:07] just before you climb the sycamore tree
[1:50:10] I already knew you I'm the one that put
[1:50:13] that desire in your heart to see me quit
[1:50:16] worrying about whether or not you're
[1:50:17] going to make it quit worrying about
[1:50:18] whether or not he's going to meet you
[1:50:19] quit worrying about whether or not
[1:50:20] listen he's the one that put the desire
[1:50:23] in your heart to begin with he's the one
[1:50:26] that put it there he's the one drawing
[1:50:28] you he's the one intentionally walking
[1:50:31] by your tree today
[1:50:33] you're gonna make it he's gonna meet you
[1:50:35] he's gonna Supply your needs he did it
[1:50:37] all on purpose
[1:50:39] he knows exactly who you are he knew you
[1:50:43] he claimed you
[1:50:44] Isaiah 43 1.
[1:50:47] but now thus saith the Lord that created
[1:50:49] thee oh Jacob and he that formed the O
[1:50:52] Israel fear not for I have redeemed Thee
[1:50:54] I have called thee by name Thou Art
[1:50:59] mine
[1:51:01] listen before you ever sinned before you
[1:51:05] ever walked out on God you were his
[1:51:08] before you ever backslid the first time
[1:51:10] you were his your name was there and he
[1:51:13] didn't look at it go oh boy I gotta
[1:51:15] erase that one
[1:51:16] oh no no he knew who you were he claimed
[1:51:20] you Satan has no legal right to claim
[1:51:23] you he doesn't have a single right
[1:51:26] that's what he tries to claim you that's
[1:51:29] why it's so wonderful to understand that
[1:51:31] you're a seed Gene of God
[1:51:33] that's why it's so good awesome to
[1:51:35] understand that you're an attribute of
[1:51:37] God and that your name was written down
[1:51:39] before the foundation of the world
[1:51:41] and that book that name on that book is
[1:51:44] a time stamp
[1:51:46] it is a time stamp that does away with
[1:51:49] the claim of the enemy
[1:51:51] and we're fixing to be bringing this
[1:51:52] down how many of you know what a time
[1:51:54] stamp is
[1:51:56] a time stamp is is a prove when a
[1:52:00] transaction was made
[1:52:02] or when events happen and can be used in
[1:52:05] the court of law as evidence they can
[1:52:07] look at a bank statement there's a time
[1:52:09] stamp on there
[1:52:10] they can see when a sale happened on the
[1:52:13] internet there's a time stamp that shows
[1:52:15] when the transaction took place
[1:52:19] and the enemy comes and he tries to put
[1:52:21] a claim on my life and he says no no
[1:52:24] God I see here where he fully
[1:52:27] surrendered his heart to you in the year
[1:52:29] 2013. Lord says that's right
[1:52:33] he says well according to my official
[1:52:35] paperwork
[1:52:36] look I had him wrapped up in sin and
[1:52:39] doing awful things
[1:52:41] all the way back in 1991 when he was
[1:52:43] just a boy so rightfully my claim
[1:52:47] predates your claim
[1:52:49] and he belongs to me
[1:52:54] the Lord says oh well that that's quite
[1:52:56] interesting
[1:52:57] let's go to the record
[1:53:00] so he opens it up and he goes oh
[1:53:04] there was a transaction
[1:53:06] there was a transaction took place I see
[1:53:09] it right here and you would you say 1991
[1:53:11] according to the transaction there was a
[1:53:14] lamb slain before the foundation of the
[1:53:19] world and no sins they are wiped away
[1:53:21] he's been mine all along you have no
[1:53:24] claim on him it's time staff you're his
[1:53:27] you're his when did he buy me before the
[1:53:30] foundation of the world before I ever
[1:53:32] sinned before I ever stumbled before I
[1:53:35] ever even struggled he said time stamp
[1:53:38] your mind timestamp I bought you with my
[1:53:42] own precious blood his claim is not
[1:53:46] legitimate
[1:53:48] he has no claim on you you are always
[1:53:51] his
[1:53:51] you were always his
[1:53:54] Hallelujah
[1:53:56] the enemy's claim today is fraudulent
[1:54:03] this would be our last little portion
[1:54:05] here
[1:54:07] I love how all of this has taken place
[1:54:10] in Jericho
[1:54:13] Bartimaeus is healed in Jericho
[1:54:16] Zacchaeus is spoken to in Jericho
[1:54:20] because if you'll recall Jericho is a
[1:54:23] cursed City
[1:54:25] Joshua 6 26 tells us
[1:54:27] and Joshua adjured them at that time
[1:54:31] saying cursed be the man before the Lord
[1:54:33] that riseth up and buildeth this city
[1:54:37] Jericho
[1:54:39] and you can type this over to the fact
[1:54:41] that
[1:54:42] Jericho's a cursed City
[1:54:46] but our flesh is cursed
[1:54:49] human flesh is cursed and and families
[1:54:52] have cycles and families have things we
[1:54:54] would call Family curses
[1:54:57] but when Jesus came to the cursed City
[1:54:59] those that lived underneath that curse
[1:55:02] were set free
[1:55:04] and we like to point to our flesh and
[1:55:06] well I can't because this and Daddy had
[1:55:09] a temper and so I have a temper
[1:55:11] Daddy had a lust problem so I got a lust
[1:55:13] problem well my family just has a we
[1:55:16] have problems with Temperance just who
[1:55:18] we are it's this cursed flesh and you
[1:55:20] know brother on this this flesh isn't
[1:55:21] converted
[1:55:24] hey that's a true statement this flesh
[1:55:27] will always be a thorn in your side but
[1:55:29] it is not to rule over you
[1:55:31] Jesus came strolling down through
[1:55:33] Jericho that cursed City and people were
[1:55:36] set free how about you let Jesus stroll
[1:55:38] through that cursed flesh today let him
[1:55:40] stroll through that cursed family stroll
[1:55:42] through that family cycle Let Jesus come
[1:55:45] walking down through your temper problem
[1:55:46] and your lust problem and your
[1:55:49] backbiting two tongue unforgiving Spirit
[1:55:51] Let Jesus come walking down through that
[1:55:53] today and watch Freedom Break Free watch
[1:55:56] the blind eyes come open watch people
[1:55:58] come down on the tree when Jesus says
[1:56:00] I've come to seat and save that which
[1:56:03] was lost
[1:56:04] oh but it's cursed it sure is
[1:56:07] but add Jesus to that equation
[1:56:10] and those who live underneath that curse
[1:56:13] will be set free
[1:56:15] and here we are Jesus is doing the
[1:56:18] impossible
[1:56:19] in an impossible place
[1:56:22] and he was doing it for people who were
[1:56:24] willing to go beyond the Press
[1:56:27] they were willing to fight
[1:56:29] willing to cry out like Bartimaeus
[1:56:32] willing to lay it all down
[1:56:34] and what we're going to see here
[1:56:37] is that our response to Jesus
[1:56:40] plays a major major role in the outcome
[1:56:42] of the story
[1:56:44] your response to Jesus determined your
[1:56:46] outcome
[1:56:48] Luke 19 6
[1:56:50] back to Zacchaeus and he made haste and
[1:56:54] came down and received him joyfully
[1:56:59] now I want you to notice and we're going
[1:57:00] to read it in a minute
[1:57:01] the difference
[1:57:05] in the response
[1:57:07] at the opportunity to be with Jesus
[1:57:09] between this man
[1:57:11] and the Rich Young Ruler
[1:57:13] and we've already established they're
[1:57:16] very similar this man Zacchaeus is very
[1:57:18] very rich
[1:57:21] they're put there for a purpose
[1:57:23] side by side back to back chapters
[1:57:27] and when they saw it they all murmured
[1:57:29] saying he was going to be guest with the
[1:57:31] man that is a sinner and Zacchaeus stood
[1:57:33] and said unto the Lord behold Lord the
[1:57:36] half of my goods I give to the poor and
[1:57:38] right there people go see it ain't Fair
[1:57:40] he told the Rich Young Ruler he had to
[1:57:42] give everything
[1:57:45] but now as a kiss is Just saying he give
[1:57:47] the half there's a reason why
[1:57:50] did you listen
[1:57:52] and if I have taken anything from any
[1:57:54] man by false accusation I restore him
[1:57:57] fourfold
[1:57:59] listen I love his repentance
[1:58:01] when there's true repentance in a heart
[1:58:03] you don't have to come to him as a
[1:58:05] preacher and go now you know you wronged
[1:58:07] this person and you wronged that person
[1:58:09] and you're going to need to go make that
[1:58:11] right
[1:58:13] if I'm having to tell you the things you
[1:58:15] need to go make right you haven't
[1:58:16] repented
[1:58:20] because true repentance he's telling
[1:58:23] Jesus what I need to go do
[1:58:24] Lord I know I've done wrong I need to go
[1:58:26] make this right I need to go make that
[1:58:27] right I need to go take care of these
[1:58:29] things
[1:58:30] and it's after he says all that Jesus
[1:58:32] says salvation has come to this house
[1:58:34] because he recognizes a true repentance
[1:58:37] Jesus don't have to say now go sell
[1:58:39] everything you own and restore your
[1:58:41] debts and and your money Pro your money
[1:58:43] is a problem
[1:58:45] and not only that but the way you got
[1:58:47] it's a problem
[1:58:48] Zacchaeus said half of all my goods will
[1:58:50] I give to the poor and anyone that I've
[1:58:52] wronged listen that's going to be a lot
[1:58:54] of people
[1:58:56] he fits and be busy for a minute
[1:58:59] he's got a lot of things to make right
[1:59:02] and he's going to start doing it he says
[1:59:04] I will restore fourfold
[1:59:07] shows me the man knows the scripture
[1:59:08] because he's going all the way back to
[1:59:10] Exodus 22 to where if you stole a sheep
[1:59:12] or killed somebody's sheep you had to
[1:59:14] give them for in return and he's basing
[1:59:16] it on this principle he said I'm going
[1:59:18] to restore it four times of what I took
[1:59:21] and that's why
[1:59:23] he didn't say I'm going to take
[1:59:25] everything I have and give it to the
[1:59:27] poor
[1:59:28] because he needed lots and lots and lots
[1:59:30] of money to pay back the debts
[1:59:32] from the people he stole from he wasn't
[1:59:34] saying I'm not going to give it all away
[1:59:36] he was just saying I'm only giving half
[1:59:38] of it to the poor and the rest of it I
[1:59:41] gotta restore fourfold all my money's
[1:59:43] about to be gone he is selling out in a
[1:59:46] way the Rich Young Ruler could not
[1:59:50] all of my money is going to be gone I'm
[1:59:53] going to repay all of this verse 9 and
[1:59:56] Jesus said unto him this day is
[1:59:58] salvation come to this house for so much
[2:00:00] as he is the son of Abraham for the son
[2:00:02] of man has come to seek and to save that
[2:00:04] which was lost
[2:00:06] it's so powerful to me right here in the
[2:00:08] closing moments of time and that's what
[2:00:10] this was it was the closing moments of
[2:00:11] the Jewish dispensation
[2:00:13] their time was running out
[2:00:17] and what's he doing he's on his way to
[2:00:19] Calvary
[2:00:20] the weight of the world is upon him
[2:00:23] but it wasn't too late for him to stop
[2:00:24] by for a little man named Zacchaeus
[2:00:27] it wasn't too late for him to come by
[2:00:29] your house today
[2:00:30] it's not too late for him to save your
[2:00:32] lost loved one you keep praying
[2:00:34] we're right at the verge of the
[2:00:36] crucifixion and he's seeking
[2:00:38] and he's looking
[2:00:39] to find those that were lost and not
[2:00:42] only is he saving
[2:00:45] but he's saving those that are
[2:00:47] impossible to save
[2:00:49] living in a cursed City
[2:00:53] why you say impossible to save
[2:00:56] Luke 18 18.
[2:01:01] in a certain ruler ask him saying good
[2:01:04] master
[2:01:05] what shall I do to inherit
[2:01:08] eternal life
[2:01:09] and Jesus said unto him why call us thou
[2:01:11] me good none is good save one that is
[2:01:13] God
[2:01:14] thou knowest the Commandments do not
[2:01:16] commit adultery do not kill do not steal
[2:01:18] do not bear false witness honor thy
[2:01:20] father and thy mother and he said all
[2:01:22] these have I kept from my youth up now
[2:01:24] when Jesus heard these things he said
[2:01:26] unto him yet like us thou one thing
[2:01:29] sell all that that has and distribute it
[2:01:31] to the poor and thou shalt have treasure
[2:01:33] in Heaven Come and follow me
[2:01:36] and when he heard this he was very
[2:01:38] sorrowful notice the difference one was
[2:01:40] joyful
[2:01:41] one is sorrowful
[2:01:43] for he was very rich
[2:01:45] and when Jesus saw that he was sorrowful
[2:01:47] he said how hardly now pay attention
[2:01:49] this is why I said savings Zacchaeus Was
[2:01:52] impossible
[2:01:54] how hardly shall they that have riches
[2:01:56] enter into the kingdom of heaven
[2:01:58] for it is easier for a camel to go
[2:02:01] through a needle's eye
[2:02:02] then for a rich man to enter into the
[2:02:05] kingdom of heaven
[2:02:07] I'm not sure your definition of
[2:02:10] impossible
[2:02:13] but in my little simple dictionary this
[2:02:16] is impossible
[2:02:19] but what I love about the way the Lord
[2:02:21] does things and the way he says things
[2:02:22] is he tells you how it is without him
[2:02:27] and then it's like a little simple
[2:02:29] algebra equation he adds Jesus into the
[2:02:32] equation
[2:02:33] it's impossible it can't happen a rich
[2:02:37] man cannot be saved verse 26 and they
[2:02:40] that heard it said who then can be saved
[2:02:42] it's impossible verse 27 and he said the
[2:02:46] things which are impossible with men
[2:02:49] are possible with God he speaks of the
[2:02:53] impossibilities and then says now watch
[2:02:56] me do it it's impossible but watch me do
[2:02:59] it it's impossible brother Ron but watch
[2:03:02] him do it it's impossible for that one
[2:03:04] out there today but watch him do it your
[2:03:06] Situation's impossible but watch him do
[2:03:10] it today he says I'm coming to your
[2:03:12] house today I'm coming to your home I'm
[2:03:15] coming to your situation it's impossible
[2:03:19] watch me do it
[2:03:25] musicians musicians can come
[2:03:28] watch him do it
[2:03:31] you think it's too late for you
[2:03:34] you think your situation is too far gone
[2:03:37] I say it's time to push through the
[2:03:39] Press
[2:03:40] there's a press set up before each and
[2:03:42] every one of us there's hindrances set
[2:03:44] up before each and every one of us but
[2:03:46] it's time to get up dust yourself off
[2:03:48] load your weapon get back on the line
[2:03:51] and say I'm gonna press through the
[2:03:53] Press today I'm going to push through
[2:03:55] and I'm gonna get to Jesus I'm gonna
[2:03:57] press through for my joy I'm gonna press
[2:04:00] through for my healing I'm gonna press
[2:04:02] through for my peace I'm a pest press
[2:04:04] through it to this to this anxiety leads
[2:04:06] me until this depression leaves me I'm
[2:04:08] going to press through
[2:04:10] I'm not gonna stay where I'm at today
[2:04:12] because just beyond the Press
[2:04:14] that's where Jesus is just beyond the
[2:04:17] Press
[2:04:19] we all got hindering spirits and things
[2:04:21] trying to keep us trying to doubts
[2:04:23] coming against our faith
[2:04:27] just behind the Press but brother here
[2:04:29] in my Situation's impossible
[2:04:33] brother you don't know how long I've
[2:04:35] been in this case you don't know the
[2:04:36] things holding me back
[2:04:38] I can't seek Jesus because of the press
[2:04:41] I can't get to him today because of the
[2:04:44] press
[2:04:46] you're the ones he's looking for
[2:04:48] he came looking for you today
[2:04:51] because he said oh your Situation's
[2:04:53] impossible
[2:04:55] watch me do it
[2:04:58] watch
[2:04:59] me do it
[2:05:01] in the very next chapter
[2:05:04] after he says rich man can't be saved
[2:05:08] or it's harder for a rich man than a cam
[2:05:10] will go through the eye of the needle he
[2:05:12] goes to the very next chapter and I can
[2:05:14] just see him looking around his
[2:05:15] disciples and going
[2:05:17] but watch me do it
[2:05:18] [Music]
[2:05:24] watch me do it
[2:05:28] what's your situation this morning
[2:05:30] [Music]
[2:05:32] maybe it is you need a job
[2:05:36] maybe it is that your marriage is tore
[2:05:38] up
[2:05:42] [Music]
[2:05:44] I testify
[2:05:50] watch me do it
[2:05:53] my parents divorced in the year 2000.
[2:05:56] [Music]
[2:06:00] and before that I can't remember a time
[2:06:02] that I remember them sleeping in the
[2:06:03] same room
[2:06:06] I know what that's like
[2:06:07] [Music]
[2:06:09] I know how to tore up home can do
[2:06:13] I know how impossible it was I'll tell
[2:06:15] you what let me tell you something I
[2:06:18] don't like to admit this it was so
[2:06:19] impossible brother Ron I didn't pray
[2:06:21] about it no more
[2:06:22] [Music]
[2:06:33] my daddy come down with cancer
[2:06:38] the Lord did some miraculous things
[2:06:42] and I knew that
[2:06:45] he was really wanting brother Tim to
[2:06:46] come by and see him and pray with him
[2:06:48] and talk with him he's in the hospital
[2:06:49] real bad shape matter of fact brother
[2:06:51] Ronnie never came home he would never
[2:06:53] leave a hospital setting
[2:06:58] and it just so happened
[2:07:02] that he wanted to talk to brother Tim
[2:07:04] about
[2:07:05] soul
[2:07:07] [Music]
[2:07:09] he was real worried because he divorced
[2:07:10] my mom and
[2:07:12] he'd wanted to make things right but how
[2:07:14] do you do that
[2:07:16] you know I always told my dad because he
[2:07:18] talked to me about it so I want to make
[2:07:19] these things right and I say listen all
[2:07:21] you can really do is make it right in
[2:07:22] your heart because you can't make it
[2:07:24] right if she don't want to make it right
[2:07:25] too
