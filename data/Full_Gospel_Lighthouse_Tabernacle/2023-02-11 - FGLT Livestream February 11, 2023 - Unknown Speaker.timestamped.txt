[17:49] grandfather passed away this morning
[17:52] thank you brother Charles and sister
[17:54] Dolores
[17:57] remembering brother Hunter there and the
[17:59] family sister Katie and them so just be
[18:02] lifting them up in that time of loss
[18:04] there how many would have an unspoken
[18:06] request you'd like to lift up to the
[18:08] Lord we would also want to continue to
[18:10] remember Sister Angela whole brother
[18:12] Gabriel Spencer's aunt that God would
[18:14] just continue to touch her body there
[18:16] amen I'm going to ask brother Gabriel
[18:18] just to pray over these needs this
[18:20] evening if he come and do that for us
[18:27] our heads
[18:28] gracious Heavenly Father Lord we just we
[18:31] thank you for allowing us to come and be
[18:33] here tonight and we're so grateful that
[18:35] we could we could come in a service and
[18:37] come in a building that that we can
[18:39] worship freely and and we can come and
[18:41] there's no chains that will bind us
[18:43] tonight because because you've set us
[18:45] free from everything that's tried to
[18:46] bond us Lord and and I just ask it if as
[18:49] we would come before you hear each and
[18:51] every prayer request it's been brought
[18:52] forth the sick the needy Lord the ones
[18:55] that I see brother Randy there and the
[18:57] and the test that he's got ahead of him
[18:59] but I know that you're going to be with
[19:00] him every step of the way and he may be
[19:03] away from home he may he may have
[19:05] different tribulations that come upon
[19:07] him but but Lord Jesus you were there
[19:09] and you were there in the valleys and
[19:10] you're there in the mountaintops Lord
[19:11] and and I just asked that you would just
[19:13] come and be with each and every one
[19:15] that's that's fighting here in this
[19:16] congregation the ones that are fighting
[19:18] cancer Lord we thank you for allowing
[19:20] brother Donnie to be able to be back in
[19:22] service with us tonight and I'm
[19:24] believing that your spirit will just
[19:25] sweep across this building and there
[19:27] would not be one sick Lord there would
[19:29] not be one that's that's fighting the
[19:31] the burdens and fighting the turmoils
[19:33] that they had this week but Lord Jesus
[19:35] your your grace could come down and you
[19:37] could save us from every every demon
[19:39] that tries to attack us and we know that
[19:41] we know that he comes in and he Roars
[19:43] like a lion but he's not the lion Lord
[19:45] he would just Roar as one because he he
[19:48] has a bow but he has no arrows and
[19:49] that's because he has no power and he's
[19:51] just a bluff and I'm just believing that
[19:53] you would just come down in a mighty way
[19:55] come down in a mighty way that we would
[19:57] be able to recognize who we are in this
[19:59] day and we're not just we're not just
[20:01] another being that would walk through
[20:02] this Earth but but we're a child of God
[20:04] and it is up to us to be able to take
[20:06] our stance and take our stance for you
[20:08] and because that's what you're looking
[20:09] for you ask to come back and see Faith
[20:12] Lord and and that's exactly what we're
[20:13] praying for tonight we're asking for
[20:15] more faith we're asking for more healing
[20:17] Lord Jesus but more importantly we're
[20:19] asking for more the Holy Ghost to come
[20:20] and flood our life and I just ask that
[20:22] you would just come and touch Our Lives
[20:24] be with the prodigals that are that are
[20:26] lost the ones that that don't know where
[20:28] they're don't even know where they're at
[20:29] their mind may be gone just now but I
[20:32] just ask that you would just go and be
[20:33] with them and allow them to see you
[20:35] allow them to see what can bring them
[20:37] back to bring them back into their right
[20:39] Minds wherever they may be at and I just
[20:41] ask that you were just anoint the pastor
[20:43] tonight anoint him that he would be able
[20:45] to bring forth a word that you know what
[20:47] we've been fighting and and you've heard
[20:48] we've heard them the past couple of
[20:50] weekends talk about the pastor may walk
[20:52] right down your aisle and walk it would
[20:54] almost be like he was sitting right in
[20:56] your kitchen and right in your living
[20:57] room as as you and you were having a

[43:19] become obsessed with receiving the
[43:21] things that you have for them tonight
[43:22] that they would reach into an unknown

[43:53] strong in the Lord and in the power of
[43:57] your might no of his might put on the
[44:01] whole armor of God that you may be able
[44:03] to stand against The Wiles of the devil
[44:05] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[44:07] blood but against principalities but
[44:10] against principalities and Powers
[44:12] against the rulers of the darkness of
[44:14] this world against spiritual wickedness
[44:17] in high places wherefore take unto you
[44:20] the whole armor of God that you may be
[44:22] able to stand or withstand in the evil
[44:24] day and having done all to stand stand
[44:27] therefore having your loins gird about
[44:29] with truth and having on the breastplate
[44:32] of righteousness and your feet shod with
[44:34] the preparation of the Gospel peace
[44:37] and above all taking the shield of Faith
[44:39] wherewith ye shall be able to quench all
[44:42] the fiery darts of the wicked and take
[44:44] the helmet of salvation and the sword of
[44:47] the spirit which is the word of God
[44:50] Revelations chapter 12 and verse 7.
[45:02] Revelations 12 and verse 7 and there was
[45:05] a war in heaven and Michael and his
[45:08] angels fought against the dragon and the
[45:10] dragon fought against fault and his
[45:13] angels and prevailed not neither was
[45:15] their place found any more in heaven and
[45:18] the Great Dragon was cast out that old
[45:21] serpent called the devil and Satan which
[45:24] deceiveth the whole world he was cast
[45:27] out into the Earth and his angels were
[45:29] cast out with him and I heard a loud
[45:31] voice saying in heaven now is come
[45:33] salvation and strength and the kingdom
[45:35] of our God and the power of His Christ
[45:38] for the accuser of our Brethren is cast
[45:42] down which accused them before our God
[45:44] day and night and they overcame him by
[45:47] the blood of the lamb and by the word of
[45:50] their testimony let's say that together
[45:51] and they overcame him by the blood of
[45:54] the lamb and by the word of their
[45:56] testimony and they love not their lives
[45:59] unto the death therefore Rejoice she
[46:01] Heavens you ye that dwell in them woe to
[46:04] the inhabitors of the earth and of the
[46:06] sea for the Devil is come down unto you
[46:09] having great wrath because he knoweth
[46:12] that he hath but a short time may God
[46:15] bless his word he may be seated in the
[46:17] presence of the Lord as as I'd like to
[46:20] continue our thought from last weekend
[46:21] on elected to overthrow Satan's kingdom
[46:25] and that word that word overthrow it
[46:28] means to turn upside down to throw down
[46:31] to ruin to demolish to defeat or to
[46:34] conquer and to Vanquish as to overthrow
[46:37] an army or an enemy it is to that word
[46:41] it means to remove forcibly from power
[46:45] and there have been you can go back and
[46:47] you can study out the you can study it
[46:49] out in the in the United Kingdoms and
[46:51] you can go study out in the European
[46:53] world where there were men and there
[46:55] were kingdoms that had to be there were
[46:57] kings that had to be removed of forcibly
[47:00] from Power because of their their
[47:02] agendas that were different or
[47:04] differentiated from the nations of the
[47:06] nations of the world but we recognize
[47:08] that we are living right here in the
[47:11] midst of Satan's Eden and we recognize
[47:13] that there is a power that is in this
[47:16] room that is greater than the power of
[47:18] Darkness now we read this to you last
[47:20] week in that that from the greatest
[47:22] battle ever fought that William Branham
[47:24] said he said the first battle that was
[47:26] ever fought began in heaven when Michael
[47:28] and his angels fought against Lucifer
[47:30] and his angels and it first started the
[47:32] first battle was in heaven so sin did
[47:35] not originate on Earth it originated in
[47:37] heaven and then it was thrown down from
[47:40] heaven and cast out of Heaven to the
[47:42] Earth and it fell on human beings then
[47:45] the battle from Angels become human
[47:47] battles and Satan come to destroy God's
[47:50] creation what God had created to be for
[47:53] himself he had Satan come to destroy
[47:56] this he said that's what his purpose was
[47:59] was to destroy it then the battle began
[48:01] here on Earth and began in us and has
[48:04] been raging ever since it's been raging
[48:08] ever since so the battles that were
[48:10] Angelic battles have now become human
[48:12] battles and the things that you are
[48:14] facing you are facing in a spirit world
[48:17] as we went through last weekend of
[48:19] different spirits that we face and
[48:21] things that we don't see but we
[48:22] recognize that right here in the midst
[48:25] of Satan's Eden it is the worst of all
[48:28] the ages it's the darkest that it could
[48:30] ever be the prophet when he was when he
[48:32] was preaching in the seven Church ages
[48:35] he said the Lord allowed me to draw in a
[48:37] little bit of light in that last stage
[48:39] and to think that here we are when there
[48:41] seems to be absolute Darkness
[48:43] surrounding the Church of the Living God
[48:45] but there is a light that is down there
[48:48] in ghost sin when the rest of the world
[48:50] is down there in darkness the Bride of
[48:52] Jesus Christ is living in light and
[48:55] brother random said that God's Eden was
[48:57] established in righteousness but Satan's
[49:00] Eden was established in in God's Eden
[49:03] was established in righteousness but God
[49:06] or Satan's Eden was established in sin
[49:08] the very the very word sin means
[49:11] unbelief and that's where Satan's
[49:13] kingdom was built upon is on the very
[49:16] manufacturing of unbelief and we
[49:19] recognize that they are in the Garden of
[49:21] Eden there when when God God had a
[49:24] conversation with the serpent that he
[49:26] said I will put enmity between my seed
[49:29] and the serpent seed between the woman's
[49:32] seed and the serpent seed and we
[49:34] recognize that that battle has gone on
[49:36] throughout all of the ages you look at
[49:38] the twins that have came through every
[49:41] age of Cain and Abel and you look at
[49:43] Esau and Jacob that you watch that the
[49:46] battle between those ten twins of even
[49:49] Jesus and Judas and even right now in
[49:52] the land today there is a spirit of
[49:54] Christ and there's a spirit of
[49:55] antichrist and the battle is continually
[49:58] going on but the Bible is very clear to
[50:00] us in Psalms chapter 1 that blessed is
[50:04] the man that walketh not in the counsel
[50:07] of the ungodly nor standeth in the way
[50:09] of the Sinners nor sinneth in the seat
[50:11] of the scornful but his Delight is in
[50:14] the law of the Lord and his law and in
[50:17] his law does he meditate day and night
[50:20] that word meditate means to growl it
[50:24] means to speak again it's to say the
[50:27] same thing
[50:28] that's why the Bible is very clear to us
[50:30] in the book of Hebrews that he is the
[50:33] high priest of our profession and
[50:36] tonight when you go to saying the same
[50:38] things that God has said when you go to
[50:40] meditating over what God has said about
[50:42] you and said about this generation and
[50:45] said about this bride when you go to
[50:47] thinking about that thing it is you are
[50:50] a blessed people tonight to be sitting
[50:52] here to think that Eve was sitting there
[50:55] in a perfect Eden when a perfect
[50:57] Paradise where there was no trouble
[50:59] where there was nowhere there was no
[51:01] sickness where there was no pain Eve was
[51:04] in a perfect paradise and Eve still fail
[51:08] but there is a bride in the worst of
[51:10] generation in the darkest of times when
[51:13] there is no hope it seems like this Eve
[51:16] is predestinated not to fall like the
[51:19] eve back there in the beginning this Eve
[51:21] in the midst of Satan's Eden is
[51:23] overcoming every Temptation Of The Devil
[51:26] this eve will not fall this eve will not
[51:29] back off the word
[51:32] now I'm gonna preach with you I'm gonna
[51:34] preach without you tonight but we have
[51:36] been elected to overthrow Satan's Eden
[51:39] and Satan's kingdom
[51:44] foreign
[51:47] told us he said that the spirit is
[51:50] looking for someone to work through
[51:52] that's on both sides of the spirit of
[51:54] the enemy is working for somebody
[51:56] looking for somebody to work through and
[51:59] the spirit of God is looking for
[52:01] somebody to work through and we are
[52:04] going to be either motivated by the Holy
[52:06] Spirit are we going to be motivated by
[52:08] the evil spirit which comes from the
[52:11] Devil Himself
[52:12] foreign
[52:15] but notice the wicked or the unbeliever
[52:18] is influenced from beneath he said there
[52:21] is a trinity of hell like there's a
[52:23] trinity of Heaven he said they are
[52:25] influenced by evil Powers now notice he
[52:28] said the first thing when you start now
[52:29] he said the first thing when you find he
[52:32] said it's a realm here that's got the
[52:34] unsaved in it going through going
[52:36] through the Trinity of Hell of Hell of
[52:38] how the atmospheres of hell are set up
[52:41] he said the first one he said you find
[52:43] here he said it's got the unsaved in it
[52:45] he said there he said that's right he
[52:48] said that's where Jesus went in and
[52:50] preached to the souls that were in
[52:52] prison that's where he went and in the
[52:55] days of Noah when they repented not in
[52:57] the long-suffering in the days of Noah
[52:59] he said next is demons and he said the
[53:01] next is hell that is where our Lord
[53:04] Jesus Christ went to and he took the
[53:07] keys from the Devil Himself so there is
[53:10] a trinity of Hell there you see it's the
[53:13] unsage that depending not in the days of
[53:16] Noah second its demons themselves and in
[53:19] the Trinity the lower part of Hell the
[53:22] next is Hell itself where Satan is and
[53:25] he said the world is either influenced
[53:27] by the demon by the world is influenced
[53:30] by these demon powers through this
[53:32] Trinity and he said the Christians are
[53:34] influenced by a spirit too the Holy
[53:36] Spirit he said the first is the holy
[53:38] spirit above for Christians he said the
[53:41] next is the Angels but the next is
[53:43] heaven which is God himself so he got
[53:46] the Holy Spirit angels and God and he
[53:48] said the Holy Spirit come past all of
[53:51] them angels and came past all of them
[53:53] Realms to redeem ranked sinners like
[53:55] yourself
[53:56] you know that God doesn't care about
[53:58] your limitations God doesn't care about
[54:01] where you are God is willing to come
[54:03] past all things there's not a
[54:05] principality there's not an angel
[54:07] there's not a power there's not a
[54:09] sickness there's not a death that can
[54:12] stop the holy spirit for working in this
[54:14] place tonight
[54:19] you're going to be either influenced by
[54:21] this world or that world when Jesus took
[54:24] his disciples over in Matthew chapter 16
[54:27] when he took his disciples over there
[54:29] and he told them that the gates of hell
[54:32] would not be able to Prevail against
[54:33] this Revelation he said I give you the
[54:36] power to bind every spirit and I give
[54:38] you power to loose every Spirit do you
[54:40] know what Jesus took them to he took
[54:43] them to cicery Philippi which is the
[54:45] gate to the underworld and Jesus took
[54:48] his disciples that he had full
[54:50] confidence in and he said this gate will
[54:53] never be able to Prevail against the
[54:55] revelation of the Church of the Living
[54:57] God that Jesus is the Christ
[55:00] now I know where I'm standing at tonight
[55:02] and I realized that there was an
[55:04] anointing in this room to break every
[55:06] yoke
[55:08] to break every Federal to break every
[55:10] sickness
[55:13] now before you think I get ahead of
[55:14] myself or you before you think I think
[55:17] of myself way too much I recognize that
[55:20] there is no problem too big for my God I
[55:23] recognize that there is no cancer case
[55:25] that is too big for my God I recognize
[55:28] that there is no power that is higher
[55:31] than our God remember we are serving the
[55:34] most high God there's nothing that can
[55:36] get above him there's nothing that can
[55:38] get below him there's nothing that can
[55:40] get around him so I know exactly who I'm
[55:43] sitting talking about tonight
[55:44] [Applause]
[55:47] I'm talking about a god that is known as
[55:49] a cancer killer I'm talking about a god
[55:52] that is known as a as a depression
[55:54] killer he is known as an anxiety killer
[55:57] he's known as a sin killer my God that
[56:00] I'm talking to you about has elected a
[56:02] generation of people in this hour to
[56:05] overthrow every Power of unbelief in
[56:08] this generation there will be a people
[56:10] that overthrow the kingdom of hell
[56:15] [Applause]
[56:21] excuse me
[56:23] I want you to notice
[56:24] I want you to notice when you read the
[56:26] Bible you are reading the very love
[56:29] language of God
[56:30] you are reading Heaven's language and I
[56:33] believe If Heaven talks to us in a way
[56:35] that we ought to be able to talk that
[56:36] same way
[56:39] is that right now notice now notice I'm
[56:41] going to take you just for a moment but
[56:42] notice in Luke chapter 1 and verse 46
[56:45] that when Mary receives the promise from
[56:48] the angel that Mary said my soul doth
[56:52] magnify the Lord and my spirit hath
[56:55] rejoiced in God my savior for he has
[56:57] regarded the lowest state of his
[56:59] handmaiden for behold for behold from
[57:02] henceforth all generations shall call me
[57:04] blessed for he for he that is mighty
[57:07] hath done to me great things and holy is
[57:10] his name and his Mercy is on them that
[57:12] fear Him from generation to generation
[57:15] and he has showed strength from with his
[57:17] arm he has scattered the proud in the
[57:19] imagination of their hearts and he has
[57:22] put down the mighty from their seats and
[57:24] exalted them of low degree if you look
[57:27] at that word in the Greek it means to
[57:29] demolish it means to overthrow that he
[57:33] hath put down the mighty from their
[57:35] seats and exalted them of low degree now
[57:38] the Bible tells us that we know how to
[57:40] we know how to obey and we know how to
[57:43] abound but God you didn't put yourself
[57:46] Where You Are
[57:47] you didn't ask for the high seat he gave
[57:50] you the high seat you didn't put
[57:52] yourself here you didn't get elected by
[57:55] men to be here almighty God
[57:57] this is a rigged election brother Chris
[58:00] and there is no president that can kick
[58:02] me out of my spot there is no weapon
[58:05] that can kick me out of my spot God
[58:07] chose me to be here
[58:10] and if I am ordained to be here you
[58:13] can't get me out of my seat you can't
[58:15] get me out of my spot I'm elected to be
[58:18] here
[58:22] Hallelujah
[58:24] is that right I'm elected to be here but
[58:26] notice notice this scripture can be
[58:29] looked at it as it is in the past when
[58:32] God would go and he would overthrow
[58:34] kingdoms or he would use his children to
[58:37] overthrow the mighty or he would or he
[58:40] would use the destroying Angel to go in
[58:43] and kick out the amalekites the the
[58:46] jebusites and all of them that were in
[58:49] God's kingdom you can look at it and you
[58:52] can see just like when God went down
[58:55] there to Sodom and Gomorrah and the the
[58:58] word is very clear that he went down
[59:00] there and he overthrew Sodom and
[59:03] Gomorrah
[59:05] now I know it's a it's a hard thing to
[59:07] preach about today but this Sodom and
[59:09] Gomorrah that you face and it's right in
[59:11] your face shall be overthrown
[59:15] is that right
[59:17] it would be more susceptible for Sodom
[59:20] and Gomorrah to stand in this day than
[59:23] to reject the son of man standing in
[59:25] front of you to think that right now
[59:28] that bear is standing in front of you on
[59:30] every course at every corner of the road
[59:33] Sodom is looking you at your face
[59:36] but they have been given up and they
[59:39] have been given over to a reprobate mind
[59:41] because they had refused to hear the
[59:44] voice that spoke from heaven
[59:47] now I know that there's a lot of people
[59:48] that don't understand this but there was
[59:51] one that spoke all the way back there in
[59:54] the beginning let there be it is that
[59:56] same one that spoke through every
[59:58] prophet and through every generation it
[1:00:01] is that same one that is spoke through
[1:00:03] his mouthpiece in this generation
[1:00:04] William Miriam Branham
[1:00:07] and there is a people who under their
[1:00:10] Messenger will be the final voice to the
[1:00:13] final age and I know there's a lot of
[1:00:15] people that might get sidetracked and
[1:00:17] get off the road and there might be some
[1:00:19] people that may wee boy and they may
[1:00:21] wobble but as long as you're on God's
[1:00:23] path you'll get right back in track
[1:00:27] because there is a spirit of unity that
[1:00:29] is here to make you stay in line with
[1:00:31] the word
[1:00:34] so you can look at this scripture that
[1:00:36] Mary that Mary allows this this language
[1:00:39] to come out of her she allows this
[1:00:41] language to come out of her that the
[1:00:44] Mighty God hath demolished
[1:00:47] but he hath given the seats or he has
[1:00:51] exalted them of low degree you can look
[1:00:54] at it in the past that when God or when
[1:00:57] David begins to sing that song oh how
[1:01:00] the mighty have fallen in second Samuel
[1:01:03] 1 and 27 when the news comes to him that
[1:01:06] the Philistines have destroyed Jonathan
[1:01:09] and Samuel or saw that this that this is
[1:01:12] when David begins to sing oh how the
[1:01:15] mighty father now God is a God he raises
[1:01:19] Kings and he sets down Kings
[1:01:22] but this scripture is not just something
[1:01:24] of the past but it is a prophetic word
[1:01:26] to the Church of the Living God that our
[1:01:29] God hath demolished the rulers from
[1:01:32] their Thrones as mighty Kings and
[1:01:34] Emperors from their Thrones as he often
[1:01:36] does setting up one and putting down one
[1:01:39] but this discourse that Mary begins to
[1:01:42] sing from the heart it is and discourse
[1:01:45] to the kingdom of the messiahship of Our
[1:01:48] Lord that is here
[1:01:51] Mary is singing to us the destruction of
[1:01:55] the kingdom of Satan and all of his
[1:01:57] demons and all of his allies and the
[1:01:59] final prevailing of the kingdom of
[1:02:01] Christ Mary is singing at the birth of
[1:02:04] Jesus what Jesus is going to do through
[1:02:07] his body
[1:02:09] before he ever got here he knew that you
[1:02:12] were coming before you ever gone going
[1:02:15] through your troubles he saw you in
[1:02:17] Victory
[1:02:21] before the Messiah took on a body he had
[1:02:24] your body in his mind
[1:02:26] [Applause]
[1:02:30] Hallelujah
[1:02:33] this is God's language
[1:02:35] I know a lot of people get offended at
[1:02:36] it
[1:02:37] a lot of people get offended at how are
[1:02:39] we how we act and how we demonstrate
[1:02:42] ourself but we're demonstrating
[1:02:44] ourselves by faith of this Living Word
[1:02:47] there's a lot of people that don't
[1:02:48] understand the faith of the Church of
[1:02:50] the Living God they don't understand how
[1:02:52] that they can go through trials and I'll
[1:02:54] say Satan himself don't even understand
[1:02:56] how that you can go through trials and
[1:02:59] he's still smiling how that you can go
[1:03:01] through troubles and you're still
[1:03:03] serving God
[1:03:05] there's a lot of people that don't
[1:03:06] understand why you're serving God the
[1:03:08] way that you're serving him but this is
[1:03:11] a love language that you couldn't have
[1:03:13] grabbed from somewhere else but you
[1:03:16] grabbed it straight from the Throne of
[1:03:18] almighty God
[1:03:20] if you go studying out the Bible just go
[1:03:22] looking up the word demolish or the word
[1:03:24] destroy I'm not teaching you something
[1:03:27] that you can't do I'm trying to teach
[1:03:29] you Bible doctrine that you have been
[1:03:31] elected by almighty God to destroy to
[1:03:34] demolish to overthrow to conquer to
[1:03:38] Vanquish every spirit
[1:03:41] every spirit is subject to the name of
[1:03:45] the Lord Jesus Christ you remember when
[1:03:47] William Branham goes in there not going
[1:03:49] to throw the through the whole story but
[1:03:50] you remember when William Branham goes
[1:03:52] in there into that spiritualist camp and
[1:03:55] there there William Branham he saw and
[1:03:57] another brother was sitting there and
[1:03:59] that witchcraft spirit that was
[1:04:01] operating in in a spiritualist camp had
[1:04:04] that table floating around in the air
[1:04:06] and I want you to know I'm putting the
[1:04:08] devil on notice that this name of Jesus
[1:04:11] Christ will break every Power of
[1:04:13] Witchcraft it will break every Jezebel
[1:04:16] spirit it will break every rebelling
[1:04:18] spirit
[1:04:19] but when William Branham goes in there
[1:04:21] she recognizes this is a man of power
[1:04:26] but she said now let me now if you've
[1:04:28] got so much power why don't you command
[1:04:30] that to come down now notice he said now
[1:04:33] notice what he said he said now I don't
[1:04:35] have no power but I represent one and
[1:04:38] you remember you remember he didn't go
[1:04:40] in there in his own name he went in
[1:04:42] there in the name of the father he went
[1:04:44] in there in the name of the father and
[1:04:46] he commanded that table to come down now
[1:04:49] notice what happened not was he bringing
[1:04:51] down just the table he was bringing down
[1:04:54] the Witchcraft spirit that was making
[1:04:56] that table float in the air and I'll say
[1:04:58] this that the Bride of Jesus Christ has
[1:05:01] the ability to bring down every
[1:05:03] witchcraft spirit that comes against her
[1:05:07] a witchcraft Spirit comes from the
[1:05:09] spirit of adultery and the spirit of
[1:05:11] rebellion and they're exactly like a
[1:05:14] chain they link themselves together
[1:05:17] they link themselves together you watch
[1:05:19] every single time you watch somebody
[1:05:21] that is dealing with a witchcraft Spirit
[1:05:23] they're dealing with a spirit of
[1:05:25] adultery or they're spilling with it
[1:05:27] still dealing with a spirit of rebellion
[1:05:29] how did they get there they rebelled
[1:05:32] against the word of God
[1:05:35] they repelled against the word of God
[1:05:38] what are they doing they're linking
[1:05:40] themself up like a chain I'm not trying
[1:05:44] to throw you some gang sign right now
[1:05:45] but I'm trying to throw you show you
[1:05:47] that the enemy comes in and links
[1:05:50] himself together it's a chain on top of
[1:05:53] chain that it's linking itself together
[1:05:57] it's trying to break your spirit a
[1:05:59] witchcraft Spirit comes in and it tries
[1:06:02] to weave itself into your spirit and
[1:06:04] bring you down
[1:06:06] because it recognizes that there is a
[1:06:09] greater power that is in the room
[1:06:12] [Applause]
[1:06:14] foreign
[1:06:16] I'll call the brother's name
[1:06:24] but there was a
[1:06:27] it's all right
[1:06:28] there was a there was a there was a lady
[1:06:30] in our community never knew nothing
[1:06:33] about this church never knew anything
[1:06:34] about this message never knew anything
[1:06:35] about brother Ron never knew anything
[1:06:37] about myself or this church but she went
[1:06:40] to work through through a series of
[1:06:42] details of getting a job a brother went
[1:06:45] into this work and they began to talk
[1:06:47] about the Lord they began to talk about
[1:06:49] the Lord and specific things that the
[1:06:50] Lord had done for them and how good the
[1:06:52] Lord is and you know when you go to
[1:06:54] talking about the Lord that's when he
[1:06:55] shows up
[1:06:56] you'll find me that whether whether you
[1:06:59] want to hear it or not I'll try to turn
[1:07:00] the conversation towards the Lord
[1:07:02] because I recognize that if you've got a
[1:07:04] need in your life and I can go talking
[1:07:05] about him then he'll show up for you
[1:07:08] show up for your need
[1:07:10] s his brother had had met this sister
[1:07:12] and I didn't get permission to call his
[1:07:13] name from the pulpit that's the only
[1:07:15] reason I haven't done that but there
[1:07:16] there this this lady had went to work
[1:07:19] and she was a Christian lady she was a
[1:07:21] Christian lady in her own right and she
[1:07:23] came to this brother and told him
[1:07:25] exactly the layout of this church told
[1:07:28] him where people set at it and told him
[1:07:30] and told him different things that
[1:07:32] brother on was going through himself
[1:07:34] that he was in the midst of a battle
[1:07:38] he was in the midst of a battle
[1:07:42] and it was a witchcraft spirit that had
[1:07:44] got in
[1:07:45] had got in and tried to cause division
[1:07:48] amongst his church
[1:07:49] but she said don't you worry it's about
[1:07:52] to leave
[1:07:53] it's about to leave and when they leave
[1:07:55] and those people leave you will see the
[1:07:58] miraculous take place
[1:08:01] now I don't have to tell you when this
[1:08:03] was and I'll have to tell you where it
[1:08:05] was but I'll say this that the
[1:08:07] Witchcraft spirit that come and try to
[1:08:09] destroy this church and try to destroy
[1:08:12] her words she's not a message believer
[1:08:15] but she said these words that win that
[1:08:19] win that witchcraft Spirit gets kicked
[1:08:21] out that ultimate Revival will come
[1:08:24] he said your pastors are praying for
[1:08:27] specific things and you're going to see
[1:08:29] them come to pass
[1:08:30] [Music]
[1:08:38] now if God could deal with somebody that
[1:08:42] don't know nothing about this message
[1:08:45] how much more can he deal with you
[1:08:47] what was his Spirit trying to do the
[1:08:50] spirit was trying to stop our worship
[1:08:52] the spirit was trying to stop us from
[1:08:55] moving into the Realms of the
[1:08:57] Supernatural and I know what that spirit
[1:08:59] and I'm not trying to scare you off for
[1:09:01] trying to make you trying to make you
[1:09:02] think but there is even a spirit here
[1:09:04] tonight that of unbelief that is
[1:09:07] whipping in this room and it's trying
[1:09:09] its way like a snake trying to get
[1:09:12] through your mind and cause you to
[1:09:14] disbelieve what I'm saying but there is
[1:09:16] a name that breaks the power of the
[1:09:20] snake the power of The Serpent and the
[1:09:22] name of Jesus Christ binds that Mama
[1:09:25] Spirit you watch
[1:09:28] thank you
[1:09:29] you don't know what it was but I do when
[1:09:32] the Witchcraft Spirit left the miracle
[1:09:35] started following
[1:09:37] your worship went to another level your
[1:09:40] praise went to a high Realm
[1:09:42] [Applause]
[1:09:58] foreign
[1:09:59] time
[1:10:01] that had bought a house
[1:10:04] bought a house a message believer had
[1:10:06] bought a house
[1:10:07] and in the house somebody else had owned
[1:10:10] it had owned that house before him and
[1:10:13] he bought the house it went in there
[1:10:16] and they were
[1:10:18] every every night when they go to lay
[1:10:19] down
[1:10:20] they would hear people walking
[1:10:22] in the upstairs
[1:10:24] there wasn't nobody up there
[1:10:26] but there were spirits that were walking
[1:10:28] up and down this room and going back and
[1:10:30] forth through there every night they
[1:10:32] would go on
[1:10:34] finally this this believer said I'm I've
[1:10:38] had enough of this
[1:10:39] I'll tell you what hey one room for one
[1:10:42] spirit in my house and that's a Holy
[1:10:43] Spirit
[1:10:47] his brother said I have had enough of
[1:10:48] this I've had enough of this so we went
[1:10:51] up there and he took his Bible in that
[1:10:52] room he took his Bible in that room and
[1:10:55] he took all the brother random's
[1:10:56] messages that he had in his house and he
[1:10:58] laid them out and opened them up in his
[1:11:00] house he laid them up there and he stood
[1:11:03] and said these words now walk over this
[1:11:05] thank you
[1:11:06] and those Spirits had to shut down
[1:11:09] because they cannot walk over the word
[1:11:11] of God let me tell you you put this
[1:11:14] message on display the spirit that you
[1:11:17] are facing can never walk over the power
[1:11:19] of this message we're not teaching you
[1:11:22] some false Doctrine we're teaching you
[1:11:24] the most powerful weapon that is here
[1:11:26] tonight Satan cannot walk over the blood
[1:11:29] of Jesus Christ
[1:11:31] I put this message over every one of
[1:11:34] your life's Satan try to walk over them
[1:11:37] try to stop them try to hinder them
[1:11:40] we've only got one way to go and it's up
[1:11:44] [Applause]
[1:11:46] I'm tired of the devil stealing what God
[1:11:49] has meant for us I'm tired of the devil
[1:11:51] trying to steal our joy steal our peace
[1:11:54] steal our shout steal our message
[1:11:59] well you might as well back off me devil
[1:12:02] I know who I am I know I'm standing at
[1:12:05] [Applause]
[1:12:11] boo devil
[1:12:13] the devil
[1:12:15] Boone ever
[1:12:17] [Applause]
[1:12:23] and before the world began you were
[1:12:26] chose to accept this message and William
[1:12:29] Branham said you're anointed by
[1:12:30] accepting it
[1:12:41] you've been elected to rise above every
[1:12:42] Spirit of unbelief
[1:12:45] but predestination don't make you lazy
[1:12:49] predestination don't make you lazy or
[1:12:51] lackadaisical predestination will move
[1:12:54] you higher
[1:12:56] that when Paul would say in the in the
[1:12:58] most beautiful chapter while he's
[1:13:00] chained to a Roman god and he's writing
[1:13:03] out one of the most powerful powerful
[1:13:05] letters that has ever been wrote he
[1:13:08] writes out there is there no not
[1:13:11] therefore now no more change on them
[1:13:13] that walk in Christ Jesus who walk not
[1:13:16] after the flesh but after the spirit
[1:13:18] there can be no condemnation there can
[1:13:22] be no change when the son of man has
[1:13:24] came by your way and loosed you
[1:13:28] foreign
[1:13:35] you remember when Jesus he sends his
[1:13:38] disciples out to go out and heal the
[1:13:40] sick
[1:13:42] command spirits to go
[1:13:44] and remember I believe it's Matthew 17.
[1:13:46] I believe I believe that's right you can
[1:13:49] you fact Checkers would let me know
[1:13:53] but he sends his church out and you
[1:13:55] remember you remember that that the man
[1:13:58] came to Jesus and he said look he said
[1:14:01] my son's alone are taking the off times
[1:14:03] falls in the fire he often falls in the
[1:14:05] fire he said but I brought him to your
[1:14:07] servants he said I brought him to your
[1:14:09] disciples but they could not cast him
[1:14:11] off and Jesus turns to them and said oh
[1:14:15] you faithless generation and Jesus has a
[1:14:18] conversation he has a conversation with
[1:14:20] the disciples and they said how how can
[1:14:23] we how could we not move this thing off
[1:14:26] of him he said if you had the faith as a
[1:14:29] say it size of a green or he said if you
[1:14:32] had Faith as a mustard seed
[1:14:35] you could speak to this mountain and
[1:14:38] Mountain be moved now notice Jesus
[1:14:41] wasn't necessarily just pretty pointing
[1:14:44] to the size of the Mustard Seed it's one
[1:14:46] of the most smallest seeds that you can
[1:14:48] see but he wasn't just pointing you to
[1:14:51] the size of it he was pointing you to
[1:14:53] the power of that Mustard Seed because
[1:14:56] mustard cannot mix a mustard seed cannot
[1:14:59] mix with any other seed it's got to
[1:15:02] produce exactly what it is so God is
[1:15:05] saying to you you cannot allow your seed
[1:15:07] of Faith to mix with time to mix with
[1:15:10] fear to mist with anxiety to mix with
[1:15:13] what you see
[1:15:15] you cannot allow your faith to mix by
[1:15:18] the things that you're looking at you've
[1:15:19] again
[1:15:21] you've got to look past what you see
[1:15:26] and Paul would say nay in all these
[1:15:29] things
[1:15:30] we are more than conquerors through him
[1:15:33] that loved us for I am persuaded that
[1:15:36] neither death nor life nor angels nor
[1:15:38] principalities nor powers nor things
[1:15:40] present nor things to come nor height
[1:15:43] nor death nor any other creature shall
[1:15:45] be able to separate us from the love of
[1:15:47] God which is in Christ Jesus our lord
[1:15:50] foreign
[1:15:53] I can walk through the valley of the
[1:15:55] shadow of death because I am persuaded
[1:16:01] I'd say that Ron Spitzer's faith has
[1:16:03] been on trial
[1:16:05] and he was persuaded that no cancer
[1:16:08] demon that no sugar demon would be able
[1:16:12] to separate him from the love of God
[1:16:14] which is in Christ Jesus
[1:16:17] now you put your faith on trial just for
[1:16:19] a minute and you have the same
[1:16:20] conversation the same language that Paul
[1:16:23] had that though he was chained to a
[1:16:25] Roman Taylor but he was not looking at
[1:16:28] what he seen with his eyes he said in
[1:16:30] more than all of these sayings I'm more
[1:16:33] than a conqueror
[1:16:34] Satan you can try to chain me up but I
[1:16:37] am more than a conqueror you can try to
[1:16:39] stop my faith but I'm more than a
[1:16:41] conqueror I can walk through hell with
[1:16:44] this kind of persuasion in my mind that
[1:16:46] I can do all things through Christ Jesus
[1:16:49] who gives me strength year of God little
[1:16:51] children and greater is he that is in
[1:16:53] you than he that is in the world
[1:16:58] you see the Church of the Living God has
[1:16:59] been given power to cast down every
[1:17:02] every enemy there is nothing going to
[1:17:04] stop you there's no sickness that can
[1:17:07] hinder you there's no depression that
[1:17:08] can hold you back there's no devil that
[1:17:10] can withhold you there is no power in
[1:17:13] hell that is going to stop you
[1:17:16] you say well I got diagnosed with this a
[1:17:19] diagnosis it's not a verdict
[1:17:22] it is not your outcome just because the
[1:17:25] doctor says this or the devil says that
[1:17:27] a diagnosis is not a verdict it's just a
[1:17:31] mountain that God is asking you to move
[1:17:34] and he is obsessed with his children
[1:17:36] using his word to destroy every devil
[1:17:44] the cancer that runs rampant in Randy
[1:17:46] Hinkle's body is nothing to my Lord
[1:17:48] Jesus Christ the cancer that runs
[1:17:51] rampant for Ron Spencer is nothing to my
[1:17:53] Lord Jesus Christ the cancer that seems
[1:17:55] like it's whipping Erica Parker is
[1:17:58] nothing to my Lord Jesus Christ
[1:18:02] there's going to be somebody that wakes
[1:18:05] up to the fact that the Shekinah Glory
[1:18:07] is in the room
[1:18:09] and he's here to heal he's here to set
[1:18:11] free I'll say that even right now that
[1:18:14] Satan is losing his subjects
[1:18:16] I say right now that Satan is losing his
[1:18:19] strongholds that he's got on the Church
[1:18:21] of the Living God whether you're here or
[1:18:23] whether you're on the internet Satan is
[1:18:25] losing his subjects that one's long that
[1:18:28] one's gone that one's loose that one's
[1:18:30] free that one's healed that one's
[1:18:33] delivered
[1:18:34] now if you had change on you you know
[1:18:37] what it's like to be free let me tell
[1:18:39] you Freedom looks good on you Church
[1:18:42] Liberty looks good on you worship looks
[1:18:44] good on you the outcome it's not what
[1:18:47] the devil has said it's what God has
[1:18:50] said
[1:18:52] I can't see it but I believe it
[1:18:56] [Applause]
[1:19:01] who does Satan think he's messing with
[1:19:05] we have come too far down the road
[1:19:08] sister Phyllis we have come too far down
[1:19:10] the road to turn back now and to say
[1:19:13] that God isn't God we have come too far
[1:19:15] we've come through too many scars we've
[1:19:18] come through too many battles and we've
[1:19:19] seen him rise up we see him rise as a
[1:19:22] Healer and brother Brandon said now
[1:19:24] watch him as a warrior you think we're
[1:19:26] warriors but you let the language of God
[1:19:28] come out of his mouth and the voice of
[1:19:31] Resurrection goes on a war path against
[1:19:33] the devil and his children and his hips
[1:19:36] are what he's coming against the Church
[1:19:37] of the Living God sister Fearless I just
[1:19:40] have to tell you I'm just an eagle up
[1:19:42] here having fun and there ain't no devil
[1:19:44] going to break my wind and stop me from
[1:19:47] flying to another round
[1:19:49] [Applause]
[1:19:59] you're going to be either influenced by
[1:20:00] this world
[1:20:03] you're either going to be influenced by
[1:20:04] what you see
[1:20:06] you're either going to be influenced by
[1:20:08] the things that you feel or you're going
[1:20:10] to be influenced by a world that you
[1:20:13] cannot see
[1:20:14] Heaven is a real place
[1:20:16] the holy spirit is real
[1:20:20] I choose to give my time
[1:20:23] to him
[1:20:27] if you had to listen
[1:20:30] to all
[1:20:32] of the lies
[1:20:34] that have come against you and have come
[1:20:37] against every child of God
[1:20:41] it would be discouraging to some people
[1:20:45] do you think God hasn't heard those
[1:20:47] Whispers
[1:20:50] he's heard Every Lie that's been told on
[1:20:52] you
[1:20:53] he sees every regretting spirit that the
[1:20:56] enemy has tried to put on you
[1:20:59] but it ain't discourage God one bit
[1:21:03] it ain't moved God off it may have moved
[1:21:06] some people off but unbelief does not
[1:21:08] hinder God it just did it only hinders
[1:21:10] the unbeliever
[1:21:13] God is not worked up by what Satan is
[1:21:15] whispering in your ear
[1:21:19] notice notice brother Branham told us in
[1:21:22] things that are to be he said we came
[1:21:25] from eternal power from time beings
[1:21:27] mortal beings to time beings to Eternal
[1:21:30] beings when the word of God lit our
[1:21:32] souls and we became the sons of God and
[1:21:35] we are his attributes and took on the
[1:21:38] gene of God
[1:21:39] now think about that there is where
[1:21:41] William Branham is preaching to us what
[1:21:44] heaven's going to be like the things
[1:21:46] that are to be
[1:21:48] and we came from Mortal Kings to Eternal
[1:21:51] beings when this word it struck our
[1:21:54] heart it didn't take us to a ground
[1:21:57] level it took us to another level
[1:22:02] what is it it's the influence of another
[1:22:05] world
[1:22:07] you think about William Branham standing
[1:22:09] there Time After Time
[1:22:12] looking at that world
[1:22:15] seeing the angel
[1:22:20] seen him move now you go to believing
[1:22:22] you go to believe it over here somebody
[1:22:24] go to pray and somebody go to ask him
[1:22:29] he said I
[1:22:30] he said that light he said it's not
[1:22:32] hanging
[1:22:33] about two foot over your head sister I
[1:22:36] see you I see you
[1:22:40] he said you're you're not a native here
[1:22:43] he said you're not from here he said I
[1:22:46] see you he said that gray-headed woman
[1:22:48] set him back there you've been sick with
[1:22:49] this he said matter of fact he said
[1:22:51] you're not here by yourself he said
[1:22:53] you're here with a whole group of people
[1:22:54] you're from Switzerland he said go on
[1:22:56] believing and you'll be made well now
[1:22:58] somebody else go to pray and somebody
[1:23:00] else go to believe in you see this
[1:23:01] sister that's got that bronchitis in her
[1:23:03] throat right there now you was just
[1:23:06] praying you was just praying let brother
[1:23:08] Branham Lord let brother Branham say
[1:23:10] something to me
[1:23:12] now what was it was it either be an
[1:23:15] influence that's being let's be real
[1:23:16] true right here to ourselves was to
[1:23:18] either be an influenced by the realm
[1:23:20] from above or was it being influenced by
[1:23:22] the world beneath
[1:23:26] now if it was a world from beneath it
[1:23:28] would have made that person sick he
[1:23:30] would have made them in a worship in a
[1:23:31] worse case it would have took them into
[1:23:33] a lower degree
[1:23:35] but because the word came from above it
[1:23:38] could not take them down it had to take
[1:23:40] them up
[1:23:42] [Applause]
[1:23:44] don't you recognize what this Prophet
[1:23:46] has seen over this church that you would
[1:23:49] not go down in defeat but you would be
[1:23:51] Sons and Daughters of almighty God and
[1:23:54] you've been seen in a vision
[1:23:58] foreign
[1:24:05] I've been facing them all night and you
[1:24:07] don't know you don't know what I'm
[1:24:08] facing but I know where he's at but it's
[1:24:11] like it's like just like when when
[1:24:14] Michael was up there when Jehoshaphat
[1:24:16] was a righteous man and all of these all
[1:24:19] of these uh so-called prophets had come
[1:24:21] before Ahab and told him that the
[1:24:23] victory was Secure but Jehoshaphat was
[1:24:26] was so righteous that he said is there
[1:24:28] not one more in the land and Ahab said
[1:24:31] there's one but I hate him and when
[1:24:34] Michael stood up there he said I'm only
[1:24:35] going to say what the word of the Lord
[1:24:36] has put in my mouth he said I'm not
[1:24:38] going to say anything that you want me
[1:24:40] to say and all of these people these
[1:24:42] so-called Chicago preachers and all of
[1:24:44] the things said they'll line up with the
[1:24:46] message if we'll just go along with
[1:24:49] their water baptism or or baptizing in
[1:24:51] Trinity cutting women's hair and all of
[1:24:54] these details
[1:24:56] but we will not bow
[1:24:58] to any other voice we will not listen
[1:25:01] and we will not hearken but he said if
[1:25:04] you have gave you come back from this
[1:25:06] battle the Lord hasn't even spoke to me
[1:25:09] now what did he say he said a lion
[1:25:11] Spirit came out of hell and went up
[1:25:14] there and got him a maps of all of those
[1:25:15] prophets up there brother Chris
[1:25:18] what was it they were influenced from
[1:25:20] the world below it's just like Judas
[1:25:27] had the same flesh as you got
[1:25:30] walk of Jesus
[1:25:32] went out and did miracles
[1:25:36] he was a part of all the things
[1:25:39] but you watch he gave himself over
[1:25:44] to another spirit
[1:25:47] you watched the children of iniquity how
[1:25:50] they operate and how they work what is
[1:25:52] it
[1:25:54] it's a spirit of a devil that begins to
[1:25:56] work in them that Satan makes sense so
[1:25:58] appealing
[1:26:01] Satan knows how to advertise
[1:26:05] he knows how to get you he's not going
[1:26:06] to flash before you young people
[1:26:10] a Model T
[1:26:14] it might be fascinating to somebody like
[1:26:16] me or some of these other brothers
[1:26:19] but he's going to flash before you young
[1:26:22] people
[1:26:24] well they call that thing matters
[1:26:25] Stingray
[1:26:27] put that Corvette Stingray out there in
[1:26:28] front of you
[1:26:30] and this beautiful blonde-haired girl
[1:26:34] hair blowing in the wind
[1:26:36] this could be all yours
[1:26:38] for this price
[1:26:40] of your soul
[1:26:45] let me tell you he ain't sticking in
[1:26:48] front of you young people a grandma and
[1:26:49] a Model T saying
[1:26:53] I'm sorry Sarah I'm not buying
[1:26:56] are you with me but he knows how to make
[1:26:59] the advertisement appealing to the
[1:27:01] generation or the people that he's
[1:27:03] facing against
[1:27:04] so he doesn't come to us I said well
[1:27:07] I'll tell you what I do I put one of
[1:27:09] them rotary dial phones in your house
[1:27:11] and you can sit in there and gossip all
[1:27:12] you want to
[1:27:17] oh he'll put that little book of face
[1:27:20] right in front of you
[1:27:22] and make every woman a preacher
[1:27:24] I'll bless God I was reading over in my
[1:27:27] morning devotion
[1:27:30] I won't go no further
[1:27:33] but he knows where to attach himself to
[1:27:37] and make himself effective
[1:27:43] now that spirit's here
[1:27:45] I'm trying to show you both worlds
[1:27:47] but you remember when brother Welch
[1:27:49] Evans
[1:27:50] that his car got stolen
[1:27:54] that there brother Bynum tells us he
[1:27:56] said in explaining in the minute
[1:27:57] explaining the ministry he said brother
[1:27:59] Jerry he said he said now he said it
[1:28:01] doesn't work like this all the time he
[1:28:03] said brother well said come told me he
[1:28:05] said that his car had got stolen and he
[1:28:07] said he come to me and he said he come
[1:28:09] to me and he said he began to tell me
[1:28:10] about these things he said well brothers
[1:28:11] let's go to prayer and brother Branham
[1:28:14] goes to prayer and he begins to pray and
[1:28:17] there he tells brother well he said now
[1:28:20] look he said this guy was once a
[1:28:22] Christian and he said he said he's drove
[1:28:25] this car about a hundred miles he said
[1:28:28] he's drove him about a hundred miles
[1:28:29] drove this car about 100 miles he's
[1:28:31] pulled off at a bridge and he's getting
[1:28:33] over there he's going to get off at his
[1:28:35] side and this is where you're going to
[1:28:37] find your car out
[1:28:38] now what world
[1:28:40] would cause a man in that car that he's
[1:28:43] already stole
[1:28:45] to give up what he already took
[1:28:48] Hallelujah I hope you hear what I'm
[1:28:50] saying to you tonight what spirit is in
[1:28:53] this place to make Satan stop in his
[1:28:55] track and give back what he stole from
[1:28:58] the Church of the Living God give them
[1:29:00] back their Joy give them back their
[1:29:02] health give them back their peace
[1:29:06] our God is a consuming fire and he shows
[1:29:11] up and he shows out
[1:29:13] [Applause]
[1:29:17] I want to tell the devil that's sitting
[1:29:20] real close you give back what God
[1:29:22] already gave us it's rightfully ours and
[1:29:25] we have an abstract title deed and it
[1:29:28] shows that the token has been given to
[1:29:30] us we believed on the promise the Holy
[1:29:33] Ghost made it clear and it's rightfully
[1:29:35] ours give back
[1:29:38] it's my claim this is my inheritance
[1:29:40] this is my promise this is my healing
[1:29:43] this is my Deliverance
[1:29:57] but so many times
[1:29:59] people get caught up
[1:30:01] with them
[1:30:05] Tom
[1:30:11] I've not felt it yet
[1:30:13] I've not seen the change
[1:30:17] I prayed this
[1:30:19] and I'm not seeing it
[1:30:21] do you know that brother Branham told
[1:30:22] Brother Welch he tells us he said I had
[1:30:25] to hold brother Welch up for the vision
[1:30:27] to be able to come to pass
[1:30:30] you see because us in our human nature
[1:30:32] we'd have ran on down there
[1:30:35] we'd have ran home down there but
[1:30:37] because the prayer he said I had to hold
[1:30:40] him up so that it could come to pass I
[1:30:43] want to tell you that you've been
[1:30:45] praying for something and it's in this
[1:30:47] room and he's been waiting he's been
[1:30:50] waiting for the right time to make it
[1:30:52] turn loose now you may not believe me
[1:30:54] but your prodigal is already in the room
[1:30:56] your healing is already in the room your
[1:31:00] deliverance is already in the room I may
[1:31:02] you may not you may think I'm crazy or
[1:31:04] you may think I'm so far off some far
[1:31:06] off but I'm telling you that the promise
[1:31:09] of the Holy Ghost is in this room
[1:31:12] foreign
[1:31:19] I'm driving something
[1:31:22] because I can see it on you I could see
[1:31:25] it on you you may not see it on yourself
[1:31:27] but I can see it on you that you are
[1:31:29] letting yourself loose to believe that
[1:31:31] all things are possible
[1:31:33] you may not believe it but your miracles
[1:31:36] in the room you may not believe it but
[1:31:39] cancer is leaving the body you may not
[1:31:41] believe it but the things that you've
[1:31:43] asked for in secret he's about to make
[1:31:45] public you may not believe it
[1:31:49] oh yeah
[1:31:54] what world you talking about I'm talking
[1:31:56] about the world that you were elected to
[1:31:58] win in
[1:32:00] just one I'm not talking about some pie
[1:32:02] in the sky I'm not talking about
[1:32:04] somewhere off in the future I'm talking
[1:32:06] right now I'm talking right now that the
[1:32:09] Bible says in First John 3 and 2 that
[1:32:11] now are we the sons of God I'm talking
[1:32:14] to you that you have the power to pull
[1:32:17] down strongholds
[1:32:22] foreign
[1:32:24] do you really believe me
[1:32:27] can you trust these senses
[1:32:30] can you trust your hand can you trust
[1:32:31] your flesh can you trust what you smell
[1:32:33] can you trust what you see can you trust
[1:32:35] what you feel
[1:32:37] these things will let you down but there
[1:32:40] is a sixth sense in the room
[1:32:43] that faith is a substance of things
[1:32:46] hoped for it's the evidence of Things
[1:32:50] Not Seen
[1:32:55] I'm very aware and everybody else is
[1:32:57] aware that Whitney's been asking for Zoe
[1:32:59] to start speaking
[1:33:02] the doctor's saying that that she's got
[1:33:04] this adenoids deal or a fluid on her on
[1:33:07] her ears but I I know it seems I know it
[1:33:12] seems a very
[1:33:13] out there but faith is out there
[1:33:19] but Zoe speaking is in this room
[1:33:28] yeah
[1:33:29] it's in this room
[1:33:33] brother Danny the things that you've
[1:33:35] asked for in secret they're in this room
[1:33:38] sister Sean the battles are over in this
[1:33:41] room depression back pain destroyed in
[1:33:45] this room
[1:33:48] you can't see it but I'm telling you
[1:33:50] they're in this room
[1:33:54] you don't see them but the pillar of
[1:33:56] fire it's in this room the anointing is
[1:33:59] in this room the atmosphere that you
[1:34:02] created invited him to do the miraculous
[1:34:05] [Applause]
[1:34:07] foreign
[1:34:12] relationships are fixed in this room

[1:34:21] brother Andrew
[1:34:24] make it visible for me
[1:34:26] and I'll believe you
[1:34:30] floating in this room are things that
[1:34:32] you can't see
[1:34:40] TV
[1:34:41] this iPad has the ability to attach
[1:34:45] itself
[1:34:46] to things that we can't see
[1:34:50] them little buzzing boxes that you carry
[1:34:52] around in your back pocket
[1:34:55] have the ability to grab things that you
[1:34:57] can't see
[1:34:59] you can be out there on the Railroad and
[1:35:02] you can have a sermon from this past
[1:35:04] week playing and you're grabbing a hold
[1:35:06] of something that you can't see you
[1:35:09] didn't see this room when you were
[1:35:10] driving that train you didn't see this
[1:35:12] Pulpit when you were driving that train
[1:35:14] but it came into the room where you was
[1:35:17] at
[1:35:18] foreign
[1:35:19] it came into the room where you was at
[1:35:21] let me tell you let me tell you just as
[1:35:25] much as you can tap into the channel of
[1:35:28] a world of YouTube and grab something
[1:35:31] across Seas
[1:35:32] you have the ability to tap into the
[1:35:35] channel of faith and grab your promise
[1:35:38] out of it to grab what Jesus did two
[1:35:42] thousand years ago
[1:35:44] what did Elena Butch go in there and do
[1:35:46] she was leaning on the Everlasting Arms
[1:35:49] and she grabbed a hold of his arms and
[1:35:51] started dancing what was it she was
[1:35:55] dancing with another world
[1:36:00] foreign
[1:36:01] had miscarriages and it didn't look like
[1:36:04] we was going to have a baby but we
[1:36:07] started walking with another world
[1:36:16] said
[1:36:20] I can prove his teeth he said he started
[1:36:22] moving in this room
[1:36:25] he said there are Airwaves
[1:36:27] that are going through that only can be
[1:36:29] picked up by certain things he said by
[1:36:30] channel of radio he's got a crystal in
[1:36:33] there that he could reach in
[1:36:37] and he could touch he said
[1:36:39] he said you could say that great big
[1:36:41] word yes
[1:36:42] and he said that yes could be flying all
[1:36:44] through this room
[1:36:46] let's say that together yes it could be
[1:36:48] flying right through this room and he
[1:36:50] said what happens he said it comes to
[1:36:53] that transmitter and that transmitter
[1:36:56] has the ability to to transmit it into a
[1:36:59] wave of sound so that you can hear it
[1:37:02] and when that wave of yes goes through
[1:37:05] the room it comes and attaches itself to
[1:37:08] that transmitter and you hear yes
[1:37:13] you hear yes he said now he said it's
[1:37:17] like when the preaching of the word is
[1:37:18] going forth he said when the man of God
[1:37:21] reads Mark 11 24 that these things that
[1:37:25] you pray believe that you shall receive
[1:37:27] them and one person says yes and another
[1:37:30] person says yes and another person says
[1:37:33] yes he said before long he said you've
[1:37:35] got double the power or you've got
[1:37:37] triple the power he said but before long
[1:37:39] you've got a thousand power of yes that
[1:37:42] is operating in this room and you don't
[1:37:45] know it but you in your spirit are
[1:37:47] saying yes
[1:37:48] yes I receive your spirit yes I receive
[1:37:51] my healing

[1:38:26] you accepted the gifts into the body
[1:38:28] brother Bynum said that that was God's
[1:38:30] love token to the church
[1:38:33] you didn't know what you was doing but
[1:38:36] you accepted his dress flare
[1:38:41] in your righteousness clothe me in your
[1:38:43] blood make me pure

[1:39:21] doubt he speaks to you in a word of
[1:39:22] faith
[1:39:24] and if you could operate through
[1:39:25] Prophets
[1:39:26] and speak to them it was a son speaking
[1:39:29] through them who do you think is going
[1:39:30] to be speaking through you who who did
[1:39:33] he go up there on the mountain to pray
[1:39:34] to who are you praying to what are you
