the presence we felt here we thank you lord for the love that you've shown forth to us lord lord we gathered on this easter weekend lord not to just see one another say we've got a new dress or a new suit but lord you've dressed us in the word of god lord i'm praying lord you they can have your way in this service beyond my words god in my heart lord minister to the uplifted hand lord lord i too need more of you lord i'm praying lord may we never come to the place where it's just another service but it's a time together together to praise you touch each and every heart each of your hand is lifted lord minister to their needs just draw us all nearer to thee lord for this is just a temporal home we live here in the lord you went to prepare a place for us that where you are there we may be also and we're looking to that day the lord we're looking for a change in our life tonight we ask us for your glory in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen jonah 1 now jonah the word of the lord came unto jonah the son of amethyst saying arise and go to nineveh that great city and cry against it their wickedness has come before me but jonah rose up and to flee unto tarnish from the presence of the lord and went to joppa and there he found a ship to tarnish so he paid the further of and went there and down into it to go with them unto tarnish from the presence of the lord but the lord sent out a great wind into the sea there was a mighty tempest in the sea so that the ship was like to be broken then the mariners were afraid and cried everyone every man into his god and cast forth their wares that they were in the ship of the sea into the sea to lighten it of them but jonah was gone down inside this in the size of the ship and he lay and was fast asleep so the ship master came to him and said unto him what meanest thou will sleeper arise call upon thy god and if so be that that god will think upon us that we shall not perish we perish not and they said every one of them to his fellows come and let us cast lots that we may know who is the cause of this evil is upon us so they cast lots and the lots fell upon jonah then they said unto him tell us we pray for whose cause this evil is upon us what is thine occupation and whence cometh thou what is thy country and of what people art thou and he said unto them i am a hebrew and i fear the lord and the god of heaven which hath made the sea and the dry land then the men were exceedingly frayed and said unto him why hast thou done this for the men knew that he fled from the presence of the lord because he had told them and then they said unto him what shall we do unto thee that the sea may calm down and from this wrought and so temptress and he said unto them take me up cast me forth unto the sea so that the sea will become for you for i know that for my sake this is the great temptus is upon you may the lord add his blessings to his word deceiving amen you may be seated we look at description we've read it and we've heard it many times we look at the times that we've we've been in those have you ever been in the belly of a well when they cast him off of there there was a special fish that was made that was come up to take him under hey man i looked at this and i'm looking at this from a standpoint of jesus christ and what he had to do when he went into the belly of hell amen when he was cast down he here's jonah and jonah is sitting here and he's looking at things and he's taking it taking it he's roaming in he he knows what's going on and it says to look at it brother braham says looking at the old testament as a shadow of the new testament and i looked at it and i've seen jonah here he's sitting here he could have he could have told him anything but he told them the truth and they they knew and you'll notice in the scriptures that their god was small but his god was g big g was inside of there amen i thank god tonight the big g is in here tonight amen and i looked at this and i said you know that's just what the devil wants to do he wants to get us caught up in the tempest of life and the things that's going on and the many times we get caught in the belly of that well amen and we look at that we say there's no way out and we see the thing but he he willingly he willingly gave himself over to those mariners that was there to save their lives and they knew there was something different about him than there was about anybody else because his god was god amen he brought that temptates upon them and you look at it you see he freely gave himself over to him he didn't fight he didn't he said this is my fault this is my what i'm doing and you know you can look at the world what all's going on now right now the devil is trying to stop this bride the devil is trying to stop this bride and what are you doing you being a lighthouse to those ones that are out here beyond the walls of this amen you're being a lighthouse as you walk out there we are the reason this is coming up on this earth amen we are the reason brother brown told us what was going to happen in the latter times and how temperatures would come up on the devil is trying to stop you and he's trying to keep you at home he's trying to separate you from the love of god but there's something on the inside of you that says my god is greater than anything that they can come upon me and man you look at this you see god moving but you see him you see jonah here he is he's handing himself over to him what should we do with you he bind me up and cast me off into the sea and then they're instantly well no no no let's find something else let's find another way but no this is the only way it's going to return calm to you amen the only way and that's to find the true god amen and we look at it we see him as he's pitched over the side hey man instantly there was a special fish made up amen there's a special fish made up i think about brother brandon when he talks about that little girl walking down through there and they'll though the guy standing there he's talking he said do you really believe what they say in that bible he said she goes yes i do he said well then tell me this and i know y'all heard these stories i can't tell you nothing new because god's the same amen but we look at we see he goes do you really believe that said yeah this morning we study about jonah oh you don't really believe that story do you malcolm good to see you buddy amen so we see him we see god you see him right there sorry i lost my train of thought we looked at it we see god moving we see him there she goes i know it i know it was true you can't believe that a a fish a whale could swallow him up said how do you know that's true she goes when i get to heaven i'll ask you yeah well he just quickly turned that around on her that's what the devil likes to do the devil likes to turn it around on you because well what if he didn't go to heaven then you ask him hey man you need to know where you're standing at amen if somebody beside you don't go to heaven hey man that don't hold you back you can praise god and man sometimes if somebody says well i just want to i just want to put my breaks down i want to hold this service up or i want to do it no what you need to do beside them say praise you lord thank you lord brother fraser taught me how to praise god amen he taught me how to praise god even through the darkest of time he taught me how to praise god jesus taught you how to do that and i looked it up and jonah he was pitched overboard amen and i want to get right down into what's going on amen i see i see jonas he's resting there amen he's down in the belly of this well it's a special made well i know you've heard this story many times but i looked at it there was air down inside of there there was there down inside there enough to sustain him for quite a while for quite a while it sustained him what he got him to doing many times god will leave you in the valley of destruction in the belly of the well and so long until the only thing you could do is start finding your way around which way is the lord my god amen which way should i face to praise him which way should i pray to him i mean many times we find ourselves our allotment in life we're saying god the devil has us so wrapped up in bondage that we can look around we can see the seaweeds of life amen with drinking and smoking and you know we've all been a fear to something amen but you look at them but a trick of an enemy that tells you you've got to fear this so you got there's no fear in them to believe amen and i believe that all things are possible through the name of the lord jesus christ and i see god moving by his spirit because god had a purpose for him to be there god had a purpose for jonah that he needed him in nineveh he had a purpose it was a sign just like it was when jesus coming up on this earth amen he had a he had a need for jonah to be in there because people needed to be saved people need to be saved from their sin ways life amen that's what preachers need to do today and stop getting off them look well i don't want to say this because we hurt somebody if it's in the word and it's the word of god it better be said amen it may be drawn out here that when you when you're lying and cheating and committing adultery all this stuff's going on you're going to go to hell hey man there is a no but there ain't no halfway point a halfway house that you can get out of and man when you die socialite tree lie that's the way it's going to be when you get and i'm praying to god that tonight when you're finding yourself and you're finding there that you're wanting something more than what you have i pray to god you find yourself at an altar amen because there's no better place to find yourself with jesus christ and that one night i thought i was king of the hill i thought i was king of the hill i had everything going for me amen i had dad praying for me i could live the life of whatever life i wanted to live i did what i wanted to do hey man you hear it all the time about how this thing but i'm not giving you the right to go out there and do that i'm not giving you the right to go out there and do that god get your attention in this service tonight i'm praying god brings you to an altar of repentance amen that god can be there hey man my dad said you ain't gonna preach no pentecostal sermon are you i said i bet you i am and i said it may be preached to you hey man because i'm telling you right now the pentecostal that first day of pentecost and then there was people saved there was people sanctified filled with the holy ghost hey man even one fell out and died they just caught up on him and prayed for him he come back to life hey man i'm telling you right now we're looking at a modern day where's wrong leanette amen we're looking at a modern day book of acts happening right here in front of you all you've got a bird's eye view that every week you're getting to look at the acts of the process of god amen that god's come down he's touching and healing and moving by his spirit upon him about to give him the strength amen and not just to come up here and i mean just to hold up something no i see him brother bill i see him when he's sitting there and he's a he's he's going hey man that's kind of god he gives you a little step in your foot amen i remember my mom eventually saying ain't no grave gonna hold my body down hey man she was sucker and even though she had her knees replaced she would crawl up off that piano and she would start praising god amen for something on the inside brother branham says it like this right here he said if you set a man on fire he can't set steel and if a fire the holy ghost is on the inside of you you can't set steel amen because god is moving but if you feel yourself as all darkened out about what's looking what's going on around you it's time for you to stop looking at what's going on around you and start looking up to finding jesus christ amen brother branham says it like this right here right now what we need and in this day and hour it's no better time than this just to preach this right here it's no better time amen stop coming to church because you say well i go to full gospel lighthouse many people have sat here in these services around the world and they have just gotten used to going to church it's just another passion of time that they have well it's just better than going to walmart or this is better than just staying home i get to see my friends no you need to come in with a passion inside of your life that says i'm coming to meet jesus christ one more time a new and a rich and and fill in the side of my life that no longer am i going to be the same when i walk through that door many times people walk through that door back there thinking i'm rapture ready hey man if you was rapture ready you would be praising god more and more every day amen get more and more in tune with what's going on so that means there's something on the inside that needs to come out brother thomas there's something there that's going i got to get closer to god he's given me another opportunity to be in service i need to be there brother branham says that what we need is a dine out a rotten and out to me amen to me mark spencer i need to get i need to get rotten down to myself so that i can rise to live with jesus christ amen i thank god for that tonight and that's what's going on with jonah jonah's sitting there in that well and he's down there and he called it the belly of hell amen right now probably brother donny thinks about sometimes he probably thinks he's in the belly of hell because he looks at everything that's going around it can drop your spirits i've been there i've walked those steps it can make you feel bad but you look at it god is right there with you right there with you all the time when you see everything's going wrong but it takes you personally to get down on your knees and start praying to god you could look at all that's going on around you you could find yourself caught up in all of that mock and that mire but then you got to look around and say look at all the aragon he gave me enough air to breathe he gave me enough to praise god back amen there should be a revival going on in your darkest of hours there should be something going on thank you god that i still got a hair that i can praise you thank you god that no matter what's going on god you're still moving my feet hey man i still think god that i can walk okay man i looked at it last year this time i had the everything broke loose in here and and i got bigger hey man it wasn't right so they went in and sewed it up i thought well i was again king of the

all get out i had five black vertebrae then it went back to normal he said right now he said what i'm looking at i said he goes i'm looking at this right here there's no way you could be standing right now this is your body can't control that there's no fluid moving up and down your back he said i can't explain it i said well i can explain it when randy i said you got the wrong mri i know you was expecting something else there i said you got the wrong mri nope this is yours this is the day they took it i said well then i'll give you the explanation god himself died some 2000 years ago he did that for me that i could show you god's still alive he's still well and he still heals amen i ain't had nothing done i'm on my own i'm still running and i can do what i want to do amen except from running 10 miles maybe amen but we thank god for that the devil thinks he can get you down and hold you down in bondage amen i heard the brother singing that a while ago broke all my chains all the chains that fell down around me and man god broke those chains jesus christ broke those chains some two thousand years at a cross of calvary amen i thank god for that he done that for me amen that god would move by his spirit down upon us amen it gives us something on the inside that keeps moving to say man it's something that moves to the outside amen if there ain't no life in it you're dead amen if there ain't no life in your religion hey man you need to find a new religion you need to find my god amen god is more than able to meet your needs but you have to have faith to believe that all things are possible and man you say well i've heard that all my life and i still go through trials let me tell you something the devil is going to keep himself up until one day we get to stand there and give him that extra boot right on off into there hey man this is going to be your eternal home maybe let him go down in there hey man he's only going to be there for a while because ain't nothing eternal but my jesus christ amen i thank god for that tonight amen we're looking at we see god moving jonah we know him brother braham says it like it was right here amen jonah we known him we we know him as a prophet men referred to him as some kind of roundup run about prophet he wasn't a run about the footsteps of the righteous are foreordained by the lord amen many times we look at it we see that he got they he was running from the lord but brother branham puts it down or he said he was in the perfect will of god it was in the perfect will of god when they throwed him off he knew what nineveh needed they needed god amen they needed to know the god of israel the god of jacob and isaac and i he they needed to know who he was amen and they looked at that and he said send him down her but that that that whale that fish swallowed him up it took him down onto the bottom hey man i watch my fish as soon as i feed them good they go right to the bottom of the guppy bowl amen they're full i thought about it i said you know what that's exactly what the devil wants to do to you tonight he wants to get you swallowed up in something that's sin that'll hold you back if it ain't nothing but saying i ain't gonna go to church tonight i feel like it but i ain't gone if it ain't nothing but that he's got you at the bottom of the bowl he gonna take you down or he gonna make you feel so bad but i'm gonna tell you what it's gonna take god to get you out of that hole it's gonna take a sacrifice to god that's gonna say i need to get on my knees and pray to god people are talking about wanting to go in the rapture and they can't even come to church hey man you look at you see god's got to be inside of you so much it don't matter if you were the only one showing up to church you'd be there and then you have a responsibility before god he saved you he sanctified you he filled you with the holy ghost you should have more desire to be in service with god and reading the scriptures of god not saving it for easter not saving it for a sunday morning but saying every day i want to get vested more and more into it hey man that's what jonah did when he was down there in the belly that well and then he dropped down to his knees and he found himself all alone black darkness was all around him there was nobody down there to hold his hand there was nobody down there to say this is what you need to do he could probably hear in the background the echo went off you need to go to nineveh you probably you need to go to nineveh but he went running from the presence of god amen but we find him here he is but he is the one responsible for praying through he had to get himself right with god before that fish would come up off of there and he had to turn his entire life out he sacrificed everything he had he said i'm not holding back nothing whatever you want me to do lord i want to do it for you no longer do i want to be where i'm at right now right now i'm in the belly of hell but i need you right now amen to chapter two amen let's read that just the first scripture there amen and jonah prayed unto the lord and his god out of the fish's belly and he cried i cried by reason of mine inflictedly affliction unto the lord and he heard me and out of the belly of hell cried i that thou heardest my voice for thou hast thou has cast me unto the deep and in the midst of the seas and into the floods compassed about me all thy billows and thy ways passed over me then i said i am cast out of thy sight yet i look again toward the holy temple he found himself looking toward the holy temple he was no longer satisfied to be in that mock in the mirror of the world amen he was no longer satisfied being what the devil wanted him to be many times the devil will make you feel so good about going to hell he'll give you friends that'll make you feel so good about doing wrong what you need to do is find peace with jesus christ you don't have to worry about it everybody you just let god handle it amen you just stand still and know that i am god amen he gave you those promises in the scripture amen and that's what he did jonah knelt down he knelt down there and there he in that well all that stuff going on around him he wasn't looking at it he kept his eyes on the prize and he continued to look at it amen if i can but pray god has a reason for me being here he has a reason for me being here he has a reason for you being here tonight you say well i know more about the message than you do good when we look at it we say there's many people but it takes us all amen but also look at it that same person that could be a little closer to christ or getting moved up could be the reason why the ship ain't moving forward amen we need to get moving forward amen these we just scriptures we need to all continue to look forward continue to look up and to pray to god that i am not the reason this ship's not moving i am looking at we're getting ready to go to heaven amen if it's my fault i pray to god reveal it to me and get it out of my closet amen clean me up that i can be free to fly again amen to look at god moving by his spirit down upon her life how many you want that tonight in your life amen more now than ever amen people are looking for a rapture amen i'm telling you i heard it dad always said i thank god for dad being here tonight amen amen man amen he's a good fellow he keeps me straight amen amen so but we look at we see god moving we see but many times we get caught up in i don't want to look bad paul said it i'm a chiefest of sinners we read his scriptures every day you know many people say i don't why am i going to read that because god's word was in it people look at brother branham and they find things wrong with him he tried to pick him to try to pick him tried to pick him but i can tell you what right now nobody else has ever had the message that brother branham had nobody was able to take those loose ends and tie them together like he did he pulled everything down to ain't nothing left but the bride getting ready hey man so i'm talking to you tonight he's already tied those loose ends up brother brown's message that was god's message sent to you you take it personally they say write your name down in the book of the bible that refers to you and find yourself in the scripture let me tell you something you can find yourself in brother brown's message amen because what's he doing malachi he's give you something more than saying well i'm just a mark spencer's son amen he's given you a zeal inside of you that jesus christ himself is living within me that there's going to be a change one day amen in a moment in a twinkling of an eye i'm to be changed from we looked at i said look you're whiter and i said i am whiter amen but i just kept i'm like well it keeps on it's going to be completely white and i said i want to be soft hey man i think about how soft ronaldine's hair that guy's got the softest hair in the world well i tell you what i love that guy to death i finally got to go on vacation with him hey man i finally went to go on vacation this first time we've ever been together like that and uh got to go so i finally got to touch his hair i know you didn't see that coming i looked at that and i said god has blessed him he could just as easily bend whatever the trials and tests i'm like god you have blessed him you have touched his life in the mighty real way and i see god moving every day inside of his life amen and i'll be honest with you when i sat across from a table from him and he kind of gave me that look i was like oh lord he's looking right through my life right now lord help me jesus yeah he says you're okay i'm on vacation i said but you know what that's that's like what exactly what's going to happen we stand in the presence of god and god's standing there in front of us and we looks through our life he starts finding out you should have cleaned this up a long time ago you should have cleared this matter up a long time ago at an altar here man you should have got yourself cleaned up if jonah could do it in the belly that well amen how much more can we do it we're standing here saying lord help me jesus amen i need you more now than ever i know what you did some 2000 years ago brother branham says it like this right here he was god incarnated in flesh he was god incarnated in flesh amen i thank god oh man we ain't in eternity yet amen time is flying but i look at that and i see god moving by his spirit he's getting the bride of christ ready how many people want to be a part of that bride how many know you're part of that bride tonight amen i want to see you at that marriage supper of the lamb and then i think about it one day we gonna be sitting there hey man we're gonna be sitting here it's gonna be a thousand miles long and we're gonna know everybody that's sitting there amen those days are coming and it ain't very long until we're going to be there but we have to get out of the belly of the well we have to get ourselves out of the way and let god come into our lives let god be incarnated in your life let your flesh and your mind and your thinking be only that of jesus christ amen i thank god for that amen amen i want to look at this right here i needed that amen so far nobody's going to sleep brother man puts it like this here a man i want to first get on that sacred ground with god where all the theologians and all the doctors divinity and all the reasoning and all the atheists and nothing else can ever explain it away from him that's where we need to be at tonight there ain't no jehovah's witness can walk up to your door amen you are to know enough about jesus christ now amen that when a jehovah's witness comes walking up to your door you don't go i'm answering that door nah you go come on in my pastor sits over here he invites him in he said you give me your time i'll give you my time he lets him know exactly where he's sitting at he takes him to the cloud he shows them the message of the hour amen he clears it up most of them when they walk in now they're going well i've never seen that before why haven't they seen it is because they've been brought up by man's creed amen a dogma amen but the word of god will last forever amen it will not change it will not change his mind about his word amen if god was god one time he's god all the time he knows the beginning from the end amen he knows what goes on in your life he's not going to surprise him when you're in the belly of hell amen of that well he's going to know you there he's going to wait on you to call upon him many times i told my boy i said listen here i said i said when you're in this belly i said you're the one done it you're the one you got to pray yourself out you got to get yourself going hey man i looked at malachi and i look at gabriel i look at them i'm looking good lord of mercy what y'all done to my boy but it wasn't you all it was god coming down changing alive amen moving by his spirit down upon him amen for a man that wouldn't he wouldn't even sing and then there's my daughter singing tonight i was like glory to god nothing can hold me here hey man that's the way it should be there is nothing going to hold me here amen i've trimmed it all i've laid down that chain jesus christ took that desire away from me amen god made a way where there seemeth to be no way amen i thank god for that tonight amen i look at that and i see god moving but i look at it i see my boy i'm like front row good lord and i see singing good day he sings at the house man man can he sing amen i don't know i just it's like glory to god you know again if you set a man on fire he can't sit still god proved dad amen right through that man right there he was quiet and calm amen but he ain't when he gets in the pulpit amen he gets to sing in the prayer god comes down he gets to go on now look at that i say thank god for that amen thank god for that amen i'd rather see him doing that right to her than to be the best man in the world or the president amen i wouldn't want him to even be president amen i want him to be a child of god and had sons and daughters born into the kingdom of god what was it that was sacrificing saying i need to give praises back to god i need to sacrifice my life to jesus christ we need to find out it's going to take more than just a rapture it's going to take you to get in tune with god and man find yourself searching for more of god because many times we lay back we say we'll let somebody else do the singing amen i heard i heard brother william he was back our dad asked him he always asked him every time he how many kids he's got amen he also said were you you'll sing tonight he said i'm going to be singing well good he said i'm going to be singing with everybody else amen that's the way it should be amen you should sing the glory of god amen god didn't bring you here to church just to sit here amen you don't go to a football game and sit there and go whip oh these man touchdown no you're over there screaming your head off amen what is that that's a temporal feeling i'm talking about an eternal change with jesus christ that god can move by his spirit down upon amen because we need that because you are the best sons and god that god could move through he knew that you would make it in the belly that well he brought you to that point what so he could bring you to christ and sometimes they say it's like drawing you through a needle amen sometimes i feel like he's pulling me by the hair of my head pulled me right through a needle and i'm like lord what did i do now i never felt like that hey man i'm telling you preachers feel that amen no reason to back up no reason to back up you just keep pressing forward looking for the pressing forward of the mark i call it pressing forward that don't mean stop just because well she didn't like it or he didn't like it what you need to do is just press a little harder in the darkest of times jesus comes along my brother has been faced with the darkest of times and i know y'all hear it all the time but i watch him he's never let down his guard he's never lost faith in jesus christ his testimony only continues to grow day by day by moment by moment by moment by moment by moment he said at any time it could happen i said you ain't got nothing to worry about you'll just step from this mortal to immortality and man you'll take that step there won't be no more cancer amen you can just tell mom i made it man you can just look at her and say brother frazier hey your church is still doing good the powers of god are still moving there let's go back and watch what you're doing tonight amen they'll be giving praises back to god that i knew someone like him i think about brother garnet murder as a little man a little man of stature but i can tell you what i can remember many a night in our church it says well small church but i can tell you what he would come back in after the service was over and he'd come walking down those aisles oh donny he wasn't he wasn't just doing it for fun he wasn't doing it just for anybody he did it for himself he come back in there and i'm sitting back here in the study and i'm watching him there he is he comes back out there and he just starts praising god lifting up god's name amen even though there wasn't nobody else in there in that church he was just giving praises back to god that's the way it should be with us we don't look around to see who's here and who ain't we go i'm here to praise god and then i'm here to worship his name i've come to lift up jesus christ i don't care if nobody else praises him i am here to praise him to thank him that one day he healed me one day he saved me i thank god for that amen except she be born again amen i thank god that jesus said that to the young man hey man he loved him but he said except you be born again amen i thank god that he said that to him because he's looking at me when he's saying that except you be born again turning away from all the things that are wrong and looking unto jesus hey man i think that i thank god for that hey man and brother branham says like it's right here and the people is it is okay if i read brother brown make it sure amen and the people said in the church and hear the messages of god and believe them and won't accept it they wouldn't say well now i don't i don't believe that's right some of them will just come and say i agree with it and say i believe it's right but you won't do it see you'll die dying in the pews of the church because they won't accept the remedy i don't want to be guilty of sitting in the pews of hearing the message of the hour being preached and you're sitting there in the belly of the well and not realizing that god is moving right in front of you and you're part of that prophecy that went forth that one day there's going to be a bride of jesus christ there's going to be a bride and you're looking around you can take a look around and you can look and one day there's going to be a bride called away and you sit there because you wouldn't accept the word of god you find yourself left behind i can tell you this you can watch all the movies you want to about being left behind and what happens after the rapture but i'm going to tell you what that's a figment of hollywood amen all hell's going to break loose upon this earth because the bride of christ is the only thing that's holding this world together right now amen if it wasn't for you the bride amen if it wasn't for you the bride of jesus christ this world would have already been condemned to hell amen it's already been shaken but right now we're the only things holding it together it ain't republics it ain't the guns of this world it ain't nothing it's the bride of jesus christ amen that's coming forth amen but one day in the moment and twinkling of an eye we're going to take a half a step that way and they're going to take a half a step this way amen we're gonna be caught up in the moment amen that jesus christ says come home my child come home my child hey man i don't care what time it is i hear six and nine i don't care amen they always they saying it's on five o'clock somewhere well i'm gonna tell you what i don't care what time of day it is i want to be ready i want to be ready when that day comes amen that will no longer among that belly of the well but i'm praising god and i'm thanking him for his amazing grace don't sit on the pew and die sit there and get more alive virtue inside of your life peace and long suffering amen the joy that comes with the salvation of your soul many people think well i have to go to church no i want to go to church i want to be in there if it ain't but one service a week i want to give everything i got into that one service hey man i don't want one second when i walk out hey man i didn't sit back here in the back i don't like sitting back in the back hey man that's like putting me in a like a like a thoroughbred horse and you put him in a little stall and waiting and i'm saying okay let's go let's go no i was like okay i want to get out there and praise god amen i want to move for jesus christ amen i don't just change because i'm here i do this at home too amen because i want jesus christ more alive than me now more than ever amen keep these old bones moving hey man show me why you heal me i want to praise god i want to lift up god more now than ever amen don't ever lose your enthusiasm to praise god and i thank god for that because he did it all for me am i i thank god for that tonight amen they're afraid of that new birth you know that any birth is a mess i don't care what it is if it's in a pig pen or a pink decorated hospital it's a mess so it's so it's the new birth it'll make you do things that you don't think you would do it'll straighten you up and before you before you can ever ever get right you have to come through that mess amen that's right that's right amen before a seed can ever be born it has to die and rot but that's what's the matter with the people today they don't want to die and rot out to the world so you can't be born again to see the holy ghost we can only die out to ourselves to get the holy ghost amen that life that jesus christ you say well where did that come from i'm going to tell you what jesus christ died he died on that cross of calvary he died he gave himself freely that we may live amen jonah was a man just like us amen esther was a woman just like you are amen but god used them in a special way to let you know god's works through men and women how many in here are humans amen we got 100 on that that's pretty good all right that's good amen but we look at we see god moves through god has a purpose for you he didn't begin it to lose you he wants to continue to mold you and make it we find many times that these times that we go through these tests and trials in life amen they're not to bring you down or show you that you're wrong it's to bring you to a higher height to a higher higher higher because many times we don't we don't look at the ending we're looking exactly where we're at right then we're looking at all the stuff we don't need we need to die out to ourselves more every day amen i thank god for that now it's been weekend of jesus jesus done a lot for us brother brown put it like hey here now jesus was god god was in christ reconciling the world to himself and these people believed his testimony and them that did truly believe it could god draw blessings on them many times we wonder why we're not getting blessed why is this person doing this you have not died out to yourself i'm going to tell you what if jesus christ some 2000 years ago had to sit there in the garden of gethsemane and he had to he was pleading before god these weren't just now lay me down to sleep prayers getting serious now this wasn't god is good and god is great these were pleading prayers jesus is saying he was praying in a garden of gethsemane until his tears become his great drops of blood he was pleading that they would let that cut pass from him devil didn't know what he was getting ready to do he was hid from everybody god had other plans god had other plans he was down there on that cross they were looking at him just a man just like everybody else he's bleeding brother am talking like this right here it says he was dragging it'll cross up through there he watched him the devil stood back and watched him he said maybe it's just one splotch of blood here and maybe a splotchy blood there the further he gone up that old mountain he was dying out to himself he's giving himself over for you that blood continued to pour from his body until it just become one mass of blood as it was profusing from him but he was doing that all for you never one time did he complain every one time he kept the faith for you he knew one day you would be in that belly of hell so one day my son and my daughter will be in need i can do this they believe upon me and i'll be there for them god's seen him he's seen you we sing the song when he was on the cross i was on his mind he was god incarnated in flesh he came back to save this earth that blood fallen from his veins and falling upon that ground was buying back this earth the footsteps that he walked were possession he was taking each step as he took it he was possessing this earth he was repossessing redeeming this earth the devil couldn't see what was going on he couldn't see what was happening in front of him he said i've got him sting of death had him all around kept circling him around and said oh he's just a man just like anybody else he didn't know what that flesh was a manual it was emmanuel standing there on that cross love held him there love held him there don't lose grip of what he done for you god did it all for you that you could be sitting here tonight we could shout all we wanted to we could sing all we wanted to but it took him on that cross it took him when he died when he died he went to hell he did different when he went to hell when he went to the belly of the well of hell he went down there and started taking over amen he started taking over amen it was different than jonah in that well amen that shadow that was back in the old testament in the new testament when jesus christ went to die amen he didn't go down there to plead for his life he went down there to preach the souls that are in prison now how do we know that because brother branham preached to us what was going on he walked us through there how he went down and took the keys of death and of hell and the grave and how he sat there on that cross amen and that little bee stinging around there that little destin was standing there he said i've got him and you know what i'm gonna do devil i'm gonna go ahead and i'm gonna stick it a little deeper this time than i normally do in him regulars i'm just gonna let him know that i am his ruler but when he stuck it in this time into jesus christ that was emmanuel amen elohim that was jesus christ my cancer died hanging there on that cross amen when he stuck it into that flesh amen all of a sudden it was like what's going on what's going on something's got to hold on me hey man it was jesus christ that skin was taken and holding on to death he took that stinger away even paul testifies oh sting where oh death where's thy sting here man forgive me i'm human amen but we look at it we could see god moving amen but he did it all for you that we don't have to fear death we don't have to fear anything but we have to we have to give a sacrifice to god to our lives amen completely over to god not holding anything back clean out your clauses tonight jesus christ died for you that you could live living for him is what we're wanting to do tonight amen living for him a living sacrifice i mean i look at these these gentlemen here hey man they're up in age but they're one step closer amen i thank god for brother hank and sister henkel amen they've been i tell you i give glory back to god amen they are still standing true they haven't let nothing back them down amen they may have a hundred excuses why they don't they can't go to church but they're right there amen you may have a hundred excuses but you're right there and there's something on the inside amen that keeps you moving brother randy and it keeps you moving no matter how bad or how long long life is when you get into that belly of the well you know you can go up on your knees i know that he testified to me one time he said walk a little closer to god amen and maybe i backed off a little bit but then he comes back and said walk a little closer to christ amen and this time you hear the call amen nineveh needed to hear the call amen elton needed to hear the call tonight amen that one day jesus christ walked up on this earth not just for you you say well i want something deeper let me tell you salvation will get you to where it's deeper because once you cross over brother on lean told me he said you will know all things when you step over and five minutes time you'll know everything hey man i thank god for that because i can't remember he's the smartest man ron's the smartest man i know he remembers people's faces and all that stuff and i'm like lord of mercy was i adopted amen but i look at it i am an adopted son of god amen and god jesus christ adopted me through the blood of jesus christ i mean he wrapped his arms around me and he said welcome home my son welcome home my daughter hey man because one day i had to pray through hey man i sat up around on a truck amen i went around i was doing everything i wanted to do i went over into i found out you dodged traffic by getting ahead of it hey man new york city if anybody been to new york city you know 10 million people are in front of you i mean it's amazing i'm like how did 10 million people get in front of me in the car break down in front of that i'm like how's this happen so i found out if you get ahead of that stuff so i drove my truck in i was just doing what i wanted to do and i drove in there and you know i'd go to church you know my dad's a preacher i can i can i can do what i want to do and i leaned on that many times even in your own lives you can put yourself here you're leaning on the wrong person i got up there i crawled back in the bed of my sleeper i said a couple hours before the everything opened up i
