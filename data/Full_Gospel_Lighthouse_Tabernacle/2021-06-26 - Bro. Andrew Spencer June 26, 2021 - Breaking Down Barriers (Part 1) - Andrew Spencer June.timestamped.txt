[42:13] moment this evening

[42:19] wonderful week
[42:20] and we've made it through another week
[42:22] we've made it here
[42:24] we certainly were blessed last weekend
[42:26] to have brother timothy pruitt
[42:27] come by our way and the dexter's come by
[42:29] our way and we were
[42:31] we were blessed more than i believe some
[42:33] of us even know
[42:35] just just what god done amongst us last
[42:38] weekend i don't believe will ever be the
[42:40] same
[42:41] i don't believe we'll ever look at a
[42:42] service the same after what happened
[42:44] here
[42:45] last sunday morning and we'd like to
[42:47] just kind of go through before we get
[42:49] into the service tonight
[42:50] i'd like to kind of just go through some
[42:52] of the events that happened here because
[42:54] you don't catch everything
[42:56] while it's all unfolding and i wish that
[42:58] we did
[42:59] and i wish that we were able to grab
[43:01] everything and you can see
[43:03] most of what took place here at the end
[43:05] of the service while brother timothy was
[43:06] speaking you can see most of it
[43:08] actually hear a little bit of it on the
[43:10] streaming but there
[43:12] are those on that side of the stream
[43:13] that didn't understand and even some
[43:15] that were sitting here that didn't even
[43:16] understand everything that had happened
[43:18] last weekend
[43:20] so it just to just to draw your memory
[43:23] back just for a moment you remember
[43:25] you remember that that that morning
[43:27] brother matthew had invited brother
[43:28] michael dexter to come up here
[43:30] and to to sing sing that morning
[43:34] and brother michael gets up and he
[43:35] starts speaking about he starts speaking
[43:37] about that song the great physician now
[43:39] is near
[43:41] and and he gets up and he is going to
[43:43] sing and he starts talking about the
[43:45] event that happened when
[43:47] when about that song when brother
[43:48] branham was playing praying for that
[43:50] little child that had polio in his
[43:52] brother branham said that little child
[43:54] his feet was
[43:55] all drawed up and drawn in there brother
[43:57] branham said he'd seen that light come
[43:59] in and then the mother was standing down
[44:01] there at the end of the altar and he
[44:02] seen that light and brother branham
[44:03] first thought it was a janitor
[44:05] that had shined the light from the stage
[44:07] in his eyes and brother branham thought
[44:09] well that's an awful rude thing to do is
[44:11] to shine a light in somebody's eyes
[44:13] and then he realizes that it's the
[44:14] pillar of fire that's standing there
[44:16] brother branham said now he said i don't
[44:18] know what what happened he said whether
[44:20] i dropped the child or he jumped out of
[44:21] my child he said but when he hit the
[44:23] ground that child's legs come out
[44:26] and he ran over to his mother well that
[44:28] you remember when brother branham starts
[44:30] talking about that mennonite nazarene
[44:31] lady that had been playing the piano she
[44:33] was a friend with this woman
[44:35] and she when she saw that event take
[44:37] place she jumped up and started shouting
[44:40] there
[44:40] and while she was playing the great
[44:42] physician now is near
[44:43] and the piano kept playing and brother
[44:45] brother michael is going through that
[44:47] event and starts telling those things
[44:48] well our musicians you'll notice you'll
[44:50] remember that our musicians were thrown
[44:53] off a little bit
[44:54] because brother michael started singing
[44:56] a complete different song
[44:58] and he's saying then jesus came when
[45:01] jesus come the tempter's power
[45:03] is broken and you remember that that the
[45:06] musicians kind of caught off guard there
[45:07] because they were already in the tune
[45:09] and
[45:09] playing the great physician now is near
[45:12] and i looked at brother ron and i said
[45:14] brother michael was singing a different
[45:15] song than what he even said
[45:17] he was going to sing actually i looked
[45:18] up the words thinking
[45:20] you know maybe i'm off base here brother
[45:22] ron looked at me said we're in for a
[45:24] supernatural event
[45:26] and so you remember that brother timothy
[45:29] begins to preach on the god
[45:31] who answers and the god who can and you
[45:34] remember brother timothy's coming down
[45:36] and all the events that he starts
[45:37] speaking on and you remember he comes
[45:39] down to the end and he's standing out
[45:40] here on this little platform
[45:42] and he starts speaking about the three
[45:44] hebrew children
[45:45] how that they would not bow to the image
[45:48] and how they would not bow down to those
[45:50] things
[45:51] and that that god up in heaven the
[45:53] angels were having a conversation
[45:55] do you see what's going on with your
[45:57] children and wormwood said he would go
[45:59] and gabriel said that he would go
[46:01] but god said no i'm not sending you but
[46:04] i'm coming down
[46:06] myself and brother timothy just kind of
[46:09] whirled around and he said could you
[46:10] imagine and all of a sudden brother
[46:12] timothy's
[46:14] ipad starts playing a sermon the worst
[46:17] center in the city
[46:18] 1956 in minneapolis minnesota
[46:23] now so while you're standing here this
[46:26] this completely caught brother timothy
[46:27] off guard
[46:29] you you all were very aware that it
[46:31] caught him off guard
[46:33] and as he's standing there he just began
[46:35] to say mercy
[46:37] and brother ron is sitting back here
[46:39] where he normally sits at
[46:41] brother ron watched as brother timothy's
[46:44] ipad
[46:45] went from his set of notes over to his
[46:49] music
[46:49] app and starts playing it like somebody
[46:52] standing behind this pulpit
[46:54] and rolls over to that app now brother
[46:57] timothy says now i
[46:59] i there's something that you know he
[47:00] said i didn't he said i don't listen
[47:03] to the tapes on my ipad he said i
[47:05] strictly listened to them on my iphone
[47:08] he hadn't pulled that app up in in
[47:10] months he said or whatever
[47:12] but to think about that the lord was
[47:15] standing right here
[47:18] and he would pick a tape of 1956
[47:22] and he would play to you the worst
[47:24] sinner in the city
[47:26] and here's the part that we as humanity
[47:28] wish we would have caught because you
[47:30] remember the brother branham or brother
[47:32] timothy thought that he the the song
[47:34] that brother branham was referring to
[47:37] was only believe brother branham says in
[47:39] that in that opening scripture
[47:41] or opening comments he says my favorite
[47:43] hymn he said
[47:44] the background of it you know his
[47:46] brother booth cleborne
[47:48] who wrote that song on his knees by the
[47:50] inspiration in a cornfield one night
[47:51] with the pasteboard pieces in the bottom
[47:53] of his shoes
[47:54] for souls in the shoes sold it to
[47:56] wackley for a hundred dollars
[47:58] and he'd taken the copyright of the song
[48:01] that's my favorite
[48:02] of the hymns it expresses the extreme
[48:05] deity
[48:06] of the lord jesus and especially in a
[48:08] day like this
[48:10] when they try to make him just a prophet
[48:12] but he was more than a prophet
[48:14] he was god now brother timothy even
[48:18] myself we thought
[48:20] that he was speaking of only believe
[48:23] but if you go and look at that he's
[48:26] referring to
[48:27] down from his glory ever living story
[48:32] my god and savior came and jesus
[48:35] was his name
[48:38] and that's exactly what brother timothy
[48:40] was speaking to you about
[48:43] that god was coming down he's not
[48:45] sending somebody else
[48:47] he's not sending gabriel he's not
[48:49] sending wormwood but he's saying i'm
[48:51] coming down myself
[48:55] i feel him at the bull pitches now but
[48:57] he said i'm coming down
[48:59] myself and here he was standing behind
[49:02] the pulpit to tell you that though you
[49:04] might be the worst sinner in the city
[49:07] and brother timothy turns and says now
[49:09] is your time
[49:11] he catches the inspiration of luke and
[49:13] he realizes what the scripture is about
[49:15] that this is when the woman with the
[49:17] alabaster comes to wash
[49:19] jesus's feet and anoint him with oil
[49:22] and brother timothy says come now is the
[49:24] time to give your best to give your best
[49:26] worship to give you best praise
[49:28] it's time to wash his feet and god said
[49:31] i'm coming down
[49:32] down there to deliver them and that was
[49:35] a vindication
[49:36] of what happened in the pre and the post
[49:39] service
[49:41] there were many deliverances that
[49:43] happened down at this pulpit
[49:45] down at this altar and we're a witness
[49:47] tonight
[49:49] or a witness tonight that he is still
[49:52] god in the fire
[49:54] he's still god that wants you to worship
[49:56] him he's still god that's coming
[49:58] down to deliver i tell you i don't want
[50:00] to miss one time that he comes for us
[50:03] maybe you weren't able to catch
[50:05] everything that was going on right there
[50:08] but there was real some real special
[50:10] things that were happening
[50:12] and god was breaking through to speak to
[50:15] us
[50:16] that i have come down
[50:19] even us this week we were all so numb
[50:23] just thinking about how that all
[50:27] took place if you haven't listened to it
[50:32] i would say it'd be a great one for you
[50:34] to go listen to
[50:36] if the lord himself would stand here and
[50:38] say i'm coming down
[50:39] it's 1956 worst center in the city
[50:44] he's coming to every one of you
[50:47] you've got an opportunity this night to
[50:50] stand
[50:51] at his feet and to come to worship him
[50:55] and to think about this that i was in
[50:58] ohio the week before that and my text
[51:03] was on the woman with the alabaster box
[51:06] and there was a family from that meeting
[51:08] that was sitting in this place
[51:10] and those things events happen who can
[51:13] put that together
[51:15] only him i say
[51:18] to god be the glory very
[51:22] we're very special people tonight that
[51:25] god himself would come and visit us
[51:29] some might criticize that that's okay
[51:34] i know what happened you might criticize
[51:37] about the tape plan you might criticize
[51:39] all the events that we just spoke
[51:41] but you cannot criticize the
[51:43] deliverances that happened after it
[51:46] i'd say if there's somebody if there's
[51:48] somebody that got a real touch last
[51:50] weekend and you were in the part of that
[51:51] altar call and part of that move why
[51:53] don't you just go ahead and stand
[51:58] that's a proof
[52:02] that's a proof right there that the
[52:05] living god was amongst us
[52:07] all go ahead for gospel lighthouse go
[52:09] ahead and worship the lord
[52:12] ah blessed be the name of the lord from
[52:14] this time forth and forevermore
[52:18] he has come down to deliver his children
[52:23] hallelujah hallelujah
[52:27] hallelujah let's just just sing a song
[52:30] and
[52:30] enter into worship just now before we go
[52:33] to the reading of the word
[52:35] i sing that song worshiping you i
[52:38] believe that's what he desires from us

[53:36] time
[53:38] when i'm overwhelmed by your glory
[53:41] divine
[53:43] and i'm left with only one thing to do

[57:17] these things
[57:18] in jesus christ's name amen and amen
[57:22] ephesians chapter 2 and verse 10. for we
[57:26] are his workmanship created in christ
[57:29] jesus
[57:29] unto good works which god hath before
[57:33] ordained that we should walk in them
[57:36] wherefore remember that ye being in
[57:38] times past gentiles in the flesh
[57:41] who are called uncircumcision by by that
[57:44] which is called the circumcision
[57:46] in the flesh made by hands that at that
[57:49] time ye
[57:50] were without christ being aliens from
[57:52] the commonwealth of the israel
[57:54] and strangers from the covenants of
[57:57] promise
[57:58] having no hope without god in the world
[58:03] i remember a spot like that
[58:06] but now in christ jesus ye who
[58:09] sometimes were afar off are made nigh
[58:12] by the blood of christ let's say that
[58:15] together
[58:16] made nigh by the blood of christ for he
[58:19] is our peace
[58:20] who hath made both one and hath broken
[58:23] down the middle wall of partition
[58:25] between us revelations chapter 3 and
[58:28] verse 14
[58:29] i'd say that most of us here could be
[58:31] able to quote these these next set of
[58:33] scriptures by heart
[58:35] reading these things knowing that this
[58:36] is the hour and the age that we're
[58:38] living in
[58:42] but let's read it one more time
[58:45] and under the angel the church of the
[58:47] laodiceans write these things saith the
[58:49] amen
[58:50] the faithful and true witness the
[58:52] beginning of the creation of god
[58:54] i know thou works that thou art neither
[58:56] cold nor hot i would thou were cold or
[58:58] hot
[58:59] so the million so then because thou art
[59:01] lukewarm and neither cold nor hot
[59:03] i will spew thee out of my mouth because
[59:06] thou sayest i am rich and increased with
[59:09] goods
[59:09] and in need of nothing and know us not
[59:11] that thou art wretched
[59:13] and miserable and poor and blind and
[59:16] naked
[59:16] i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried
[59:19] in the fire that thou mayest be rich
[59:22] and white raiment that thou mayest be
[59:24] clothed and that the shame of thy
[59:26] nakedness do not appear and anoint thine
[59:28] eyes with i sath
[59:30] that thou may see as many as i love i
[59:33] rebuke and chasten
[59:34] be zealous therefore and repent behold i
[59:38] stand at the door and knock and if any
[59:40] man hear my voice and
[59:41] open the door i will come into him and
[59:44] will suck with him
[59:45] and he with me to him that overcometh
[59:48] will i grant to sit with me
[59:50] in my throne even as i also overcame
[59:54] and am set down with my father in his
[59:56] throne
[59:57] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[1:00:00] the spirit
[1:00:01] saith unto the churches may god bless
[1:00:04] his word you may be seated in the
[1:00:05] presence of the lord
[1:00:07] we've been speaking to you on the last
[1:00:10] little bit
[1:00:10] on the realm of the believer and the
[1:00:12] channel of the believer
[1:00:14] and then breaking into another world and
[1:00:16] tonight by the help of the lord we'd
[1:00:18] like to speak to you
[1:00:20] on breaking down breaking down barriers
[1:00:23] and here we see that the spirit speaks
[1:00:26] expressingly to each age if you look
[1:00:28] through
[1:00:29] the book of revelations all the way from
[1:00:31] one two and three you can see
[1:00:33] that there god is speaking to john on
[1:00:35] the isle of patmos and god
[1:00:37] brings him up into this into the spirit
[1:00:40] on the lord's day
[1:00:41] and he brings him even so far he brings
[1:00:44] him all the way into this day
[1:00:46] but here john he captures these things
[1:00:49] and we realize that
[1:00:50] that john is pinning these things down
[1:00:52] but god
[1:00:53] is the author of these things but here
[1:00:56] the spirit speaks speaking
[1:00:58] is is speaking expressively to them that
[1:01:01] have an ear let them hear
[1:01:03] what the spirit saith unto the churches
[1:01:06] and
[1:01:06] to set here to say that we have heard or
[1:01:09] we can
[1:01:09] understand what the spirit of the living
[1:01:11] god is saying to this church age
[1:01:14] we could say that we are a blessed
[1:01:16] people to be able to feast upon the good
[1:01:18] things
[1:01:18] of god to realize what the bible has
[1:01:21] said over in revelations 19 and 9 that
[1:01:23] these
[1:01:24] are the true sayings of god and to
[1:01:26] recognize that
[1:01:27] that he has come down amongst us to
[1:01:29] deliver this word in this
[1:01:32] hour to a people that were destined for
[1:01:35] this moment
[1:01:36] to to go into a spot or into a world
[1:01:38] that only the believers can go into
[1:01:41] when you when you live elbow to elbow
[1:01:44] and shoulder to shoulder
[1:01:46] in a world that is full of hatred when
[1:01:48] you've got young people that are
[1:01:49] that are full of themselves they're full
[1:01:51] of their they're full of
[1:01:52] righteous uh righteous indignation
[1:01:55] against them own selves they're selfless
[1:01:57] and
[1:01:57] we live in an age where where men is so
[1:02:00] completely selfish
[1:02:01] and it's a it's an age where men are
[1:02:03] heady they're high-minded they're lovers
[1:02:06] of self they're lovers of pleasure
[1:02:08] they only care about themselves they
[1:02:10] don't care about everybody around them
[1:02:12] they only care what focuses upon
[1:02:14] themself they only have
[1:02:16] facebooks or instagrams about themselves
[1:02:18] they don't have an instant
[1:02:20] instagram or an insta face for somebody
[1:02:22] else but they got something
[1:02:24] for their own self because man is so
[1:02:26] self-centered
[1:02:27] in this day that they can't focus upon
[1:02:30] everybody else but they're worried about
[1:02:32] themself
[1:02:34] and they're worried about what's going
[1:02:35] on around them and they will break a
[1:02:37] promise
[1:02:38] just to have a little bit more pleasure
[1:02:41] in this world and then this life that
[1:02:43] they're living in they'll break that
[1:02:45] promise
[1:02:45] but i want to assure you that there is a
[1:02:47] god that is not self-centered about
[1:02:49] himself
[1:02:50] but he is centered about you this
[1:02:52] evening and he is concerned about
[1:02:54] everything and he's concerned about his
[1:02:56] children
[1:02:57] he's concerned about the world status
[1:02:59] even though the world statuses
[1:03:00] is caught up on itself and it and it's a
[1:03:03] people that is divided amongst
[1:03:04] themselves
[1:03:05] you see people against people you see
[1:03:08] nation against nation
[1:03:10] and you see wars and after war after war
[1:03:13] and it's constantly telling you that
[1:03:15] they are demon spirits
[1:03:17] that are warring against one another and
[1:03:20] men
[1:03:20] and nations and politics and parties
[1:03:24] are constantly building up walls and
[1:03:26] they're not bringing in unity but
[1:03:28] they're actually bringing in
[1:03:30] and destroying the future generations
[1:03:33] you can get excited about your politics
[1:03:35] you can get excited about your party
[1:03:37] but your party will not bring unity it
[1:03:39] will only bring division
[1:03:41] what did covet do it didn't bring unity
[1:03:43] but it brought division
[1:03:45] it brings division and when any time a
[1:03:48] disease comes in
[1:03:49] it brings division any time you see a
[1:03:52] spirit of unbelief come in
[1:03:54] it brings division but god has come now
[1:03:58] to break down the middle wall of
[1:04:00] division
[1:04:01] to break down the things and to bring
[1:04:03] back in the unity
[1:04:05] with god himself it's not a unity
[1:04:07] between man but it's a unity between
[1:04:10] god and man and we're living in the
[1:04:13] laodicean age when the
[1:04:14] when the prophet told us that this is
[1:04:16] the age of people's rights
[1:04:18] or the justice of the peoples and they
[1:04:21] are all and you can turn on the news and
[1:04:23] the first thing you hear
[1:04:24] or the first thing you read about is
[1:04:26] people's rights
[1:04:27] they want their unity they want their
[1:04:29] rights they want their rights
[1:04:31] and they want their they want they have
[1:04:33] their own races and everything in their
[1:04:35] own unity
[1:04:36] and they're all calling for this but
[1:04:38] they don't want unity
[1:04:40] brother branham would say that it was a
[1:04:41] false unity that they're asking for
[1:04:44] they're wanting to divide themselves
[1:04:46] they're only concerned about their own
[1:04:48] rights
[1:04:49] but i want his rights more than i want
[1:04:52] my own rights
[1:04:53] more than a republican or a democrat
[1:04:57] i want to be with him in all things
[1:05:01] i want to stand with him more than i
[1:05:04] stand upon my own two feet
[1:05:07] hallelujah because this world will pass
[1:05:09] away but the word of god will remain
[1:05:12] on and on and on and on
[1:05:15] [Applause]
[1:05:16] but this kind of false unity didn't just
[1:05:19] begin
[1:05:20] you've been told about it throughout the
[1:05:21] bible that there was a unity that that
[1:05:24] you watch
[1:05:25] all the way down through the dark ages
[1:05:27] you can watch as that
[1:05:28] as that same as that same bug comes in
[1:05:32] and it starts eating away of all of the
[1:05:34] spiritual unity
[1:05:36] in the people and you watch as that
[1:05:38] cankle worm and that palmer worm
[1:05:40] and the caterpillar as it goes down
[1:05:42] through its stages
[1:05:43] you remember that it's the same bug just
[1:05:46] in a different stage
[1:05:47] you can watch it down through its
[1:05:49] different lives and you can watch
[1:05:51] how the devil always comes in he'll come
[1:05:54] in
[1:05:55] and he will break up brotherhood and he
[1:05:57] is always
[1:05:58] trying to break the unity of man
[1:06:03] that devil is always after the religion
[1:06:06] or he's after the experience
[1:06:08] and he's after the move of god and you
[1:06:11] watch as that caterpillar
[1:06:12] as it went in and got it to the
[1:06:14] pentecostal church
[1:06:15] it broke up the brotherhood that it came
[1:06:18] that it had
[1:06:19] then the locust comes and all the way
[1:06:21] down through and they begin to come in
[1:06:23] with their
[1:06:23] their different things and they eat away
[1:06:25] the experience they eat away speaking in
[1:06:27] tongues
[1:06:28] they eat away praying in the holy ghost
[1:06:30] they eat away fasting
[1:06:32] they eat away praying they eat away a
[1:06:35] family altar
[1:06:36] they eat away this and they and they eat
[1:06:39] away going to church
[1:06:40] they eat away and said now you can have
[1:06:42] it just by streaming
[1:06:44] they eat away going to church and a real
[1:06:47] sacrifice to be in church
[1:06:49] as you watch as it's everything that the
[1:06:52] enemy does
[1:06:52] is always to destroy
[1:06:57] and every time satan comes in he is
[1:07:00] always
[1:07:00] trying to rob you from something
[1:07:04] he cannot offer you anything unless he's
[1:07:06] trying to rob you from something
[1:07:08] he can't offer you peace unless he's
[1:07:10] trying to rob you of your joy
[1:07:12] he can't offer you money unless he's
[1:07:14] robbing you of your time
[1:07:17] he can't offer you a better life with
[1:07:19] your family unless he's offering you
[1:07:21] more time away from god
[1:07:23] it is satan trying to destroy
[1:07:28] god didn't come with the act or the
[1:07:31] mindset to destroy but it came to build
[1:07:33] up
[1:07:34] he came to give life and you light and
[1:07:36] that you would have life
[1:07:38] more abundantly i believe you ought to
[1:07:41] be able to prosper
[1:07:42] and be in good health but i don't
[1:07:43] believe you ought to be so busy that you
[1:07:45] can't hardly stay awake in sermons
[1:07:48] [Applause]
[1:07:51] i believe you ought to prosper and to be
[1:07:52] able to live a good successful life
[1:07:55] but i don't believe it ought to steal
[1:07:57] away your joy of the lord
[1:07:59] i believe you ought to be able to enjoy
[1:08:01] life to its fullest
[1:08:03] but i don't believe it ought to steal
[1:08:04] away the real love of god that you got
[1:08:07] in your heart
[1:08:12] i believe i believe in spending time
[1:08:15] with family
[1:08:16] but i believe in more spending time with
[1:08:18] god
[1:08:22] if you go to studying on what a barrier
[1:08:25] is it's a fence i i know
[1:08:28] most of you know what that is some of
[1:08:31] you had to jump them a few times in your
[1:08:33] life
[1:08:37] farmers seem to put them things in funny
[1:08:39] places sometimes
[1:08:42] but if a barrier is a fence
[1:08:45] it's a fence or an obstacle
[1:08:48] that prevents movement or access and
[1:08:51] it's an amazing thing
[1:08:53] that that that a barrier will come in
[1:08:55] and you can
[1:08:56] watch and you can look at barriers in
[1:08:58] all walks of life and
[1:09:00] farmers use farmers use barriers or
[1:09:03] fences to keep livestock in
[1:09:05] or to keep hunters out barriers
[1:09:09] can be used in everything you can go
[1:09:12] down the road and the d.o.t
[1:09:14] uses barriers to keep traffic from
[1:09:16] moving a certain way or to keep people
[1:09:19] out you see
[1:09:20] there are barriers that are built those
[1:09:22] things are built there with the intent
[1:09:25] that one will not surpass that barrier
[1:09:28] that's what a barrier does it's simply
[1:09:30] to try to keep you out of something
[1:09:34] this is about breaking down barriers and
[1:09:36] i'm not telling you to break down your
[1:09:38] farmer's barrier
[1:09:39] i'm not telling to break down so you can
[1:09:41] go get on the better hunting land
[1:09:43] the better hunting land is not on that
[1:09:45] side you'll get in trouble
[1:09:47] the better hunting is where the buck
[1:09:49] will be
[1:09:50] that's as simple as it is but there's
[1:09:52] all kinds of barriers throughout walks
[1:09:55] of life
[1:09:56] all kinds of things that we face as
[1:09:58] humanity barriers
[1:09:59] barriers of human dna barriers of the
[1:10:02] makeup of humanity
[1:10:03] even the emotional state of family ties
[1:10:06] there are barriers
[1:10:07] that each and every one of us we carry
[1:10:09] there are things that the spencers carry
[1:10:11] that you don't carry there are things
[1:10:13] that the the no else carry or the
[1:10:15] vance's carry
[1:10:17] that you don't carry there are certain
[1:10:19] things that are laying there in your
[1:10:20] genealogical tree or habits
[1:10:22] that seem to pass down from one family
[1:10:25] member down to another
[1:10:26] and you'll hear some people say well i
[1:10:28] guess my i guess my daddy died an
[1:10:30] alcoholic i guess i'll die that way too
[1:10:32] now that's some kind of thinking right
[1:10:34] there that you've got to go the way that
[1:10:36] your daddy did
[1:10:37] but you know there are certain things
[1:10:39] that you carry
[1:10:40] down through your genealogical tree that
[1:10:42] are just passed down
[1:10:44] it's just how it is it's how things are
[1:10:45] passed down and even if you remember
[1:10:48] when brother ron was going through the
[1:10:49] brain surgery in one of his brain
[1:10:50] surgeries
[1:10:51] that he was going down the hospital
[1:10:53] going down to the hospital room and
[1:10:55] going down getting prepared for that
[1:10:57] surgery
[1:10:58] that they were going to do on his brain
[1:11:00] and he was and he was just
[1:11:01] praying as they were taking him down
[1:11:03] through there
[1:11:04] dealing with this brain cancer and
[1:11:06] dealing with lung cancer
[1:11:07] and he prayed at this prayer lord
[1:11:10] let me be the one that breaks the cycle
[1:11:13] in my family because you see they had
[1:11:16] told us as spencer's
[1:11:18] that there was a certain dna that we
[1:11:20] carry
[1:11:21] that produces this type this type of
[1:11:25] cancer only
[1:11:26] in our genetic code but i believe
[1:11:30] that god has so ordained the blood
[1:11:33] that breaks down every genealogical code
[1:11:37] that breaks past the fears of humanity
[1:11:40] that breaks the barriers that we would
[1:11:42] carry
[1:11:44] and he would say that i'm more than
[1:11:46] enough
[1:11:48] to break through the cycle and break
[1:11:50] through the barriers
[1:11:51] of what doctors hate
[1:11:54] you don't have to live the way your
[1:11:56] parents live young people
[1:11:58] amen you don't have to live
[1:12:01] the way your grandpa lives you don't
[1:12:03] have to die the way your grandpa died
[1:12:05] what mama died of leukemia grandpa died
[1:12:08] of leukemia
[1:12:09] i guess i'll die of leukemia you can be
[1:12:11] the one that breaks that thing
[1:12:13] you don't have to be the one that puts
[1:12:15] up with that lush spirit
[1:12:16] or that or that pornography spirit you
[1:12:19] can be the one to break that thing
[1:12:21] you don't have to be the one that sits
[1:12:22] there and deals with all kinds of drugs
[1:12:25] and say well my mama did it
[1:12:26] my daddy did it you can be the one that
[1:12:29] breaks that thing
[1:12:30] young people oh people all alike
[1:12:33] it's a time to break down
[1:12:38] this ain't about learning to live with
[1:12:40] what you're going through
[1:12:41] it's not learning to live with your
[1:12:43] barriers this is about breaking down
[1:12:46] barriers
[1:12:47] and the only thing that will break your
[1:12:50] curse
[1:12:50] is a new birth
[1:12:52] [Applause]
[1:12:54] hallelujah you can carry it all your
[1:12:56] life or you can learn
[1:12:58] that it's under the blood
[1:13:01] you can talk about your past and you can
[1:13:04] bring it up every time and every time
[1:13:05] you try to bring up your past
[1:13:07] you resurrect that dead man you
[1:13:10] resurrect that thing that that one
[1:13:12] that person smothered out well you say
[1:13:15] well i remember what she did or i
[1:13:17] remember what he did
[1:13:18] you're guilty of bringing it out of the
[1:13:21] blood
[1:13:22] and now it's on you but there
[1:13:25] is a blood if you would just have enough
[1:13:28] faith in the blood
[1:13:32] if you'd have enough faith in the blood
[1:13:34] you'd realize that it covers that
[1:13:36] person's iniquities
[1:13:37] it covers their sins it covers every
[1:13:39] generation
[1:13:40] it's not just for this generation it
[1:13:43] goes all the way back
[1:13:44] it searched it out and there's an
[1:13:46] abstract title deed
[1:13:48] of the holy ghost that says that you
[1:13:51] have
[1:13:51] already went through it when christ went
[1:13:54] through it
[1:13:55] you went through it you ain't got to pay
[1:13:57] for your sin
[1:13:58] you ain't got to pay to get over that
[1:14:00] barrier he broke it down
[1:14:02] [Applause]
[1:14:07] well here let me deal with it well i'm
[1:14:10] carrying this certain need in my body
[1:14:13] and this person dealt with it what did
[1:14:16] christ come to do
[1:14:18] to break down
[1:14:24] this is the hour this is this is the
[1:14:28] hour of not survivors this is not the
[1:14:31] hour of people barely making it
[1:14:33] this is not the hour of people just
[1:14:36] hanging on
[1:14:37] this is the power and the hour of the
[1:14:40] overcomers
[1:14:42] i happen to believe that i'm looking at
[1:14:44] the hour
[1:14:45] and the people that will overcome this
[1:14:48] laodicean flu
[1:14:50] that it's not strong enough to stop you
[1:14:52] it's not strong enough to keep you
[1:14:54] it's not strong enough to stop the move
[1:14:57] of god
[1:14:58] i believe this is the hour of real young
[1:15:00] people
[1:15:01] getting the baptism of the holy ghost i
[1:15:04] remember
[1:15:05] with all of my heart that this is the
[1:15:07] hour
[1:15:08] when you can stand right in your pew
[1:15:10] confess your sins
[1:15:12] and get baptized with the anointing of
[1:15:14] the holy ghost
[1:15:16] and you not go out and do those things
[1:15:18] never again
[1:15:19] make you walk a new life live a new life
[1:15:23] talk a new talk you know i ran into
[1:15:27] young people that don't understand that
[1:15:28] kind of talk they don't understand how
[1:15:30] in the world that
[1:15:31] you can talk a new talk and walk a new
[1:15:33] walk let me tell you when you get burned
[1:15:36] when you get birthed you will walk a
[1:15:38] completely different way
[1:15:40] it might take you a little bit to figure
[1:15:42] out your legs and make you figure out
[1:15:43] how to use the muscles
[1:15:45] but you will walk differently it might
[1:15:47] take you a little bit how to use the
[1:15:49] muscles in your tongue
[1:15:50] how to talk but you'll talk differently
[1:15:53] [Music]
[1:15:56] it's the hour of overcomers and in the
[1:15:59] layout i see in church age
[1:16:01] he said now now what are we to overcome
[1:16:04] that is a normal question to ask
[1:16:06] here but that is not the actual thought
[1:16:08] of this verse
[1:16:09] for it is not so much what we are to
[1:16:11] overcome
[1:16:12] but how we are to overcome
[1:16:16] now this is illogical for for does it
[1:16:19] matter what we are to overcome
[1:16:21] as long as we know how we can overcome
[1:16:26] you see christ came down
[1:16:30] to your level he didn't stay up there
[1:16:33] with the angels
[1:16:34] but he come all the way down
[1:16:38] notice this next quote that i've sent
[1:16:40] the this and the brothers upstairs
[1:16:42] and the sisters sometimes them sisters
[1:16:45] like for me to say the brothers just in
[1:16:46] case they mess up
[1:16:49] we called them out tonight but look how
[1:16:51] christ came to your level
[1:16:52] he said look temptation was for him you
[1:16:55] know that
[1:16:56] the bible said he was tempted at all
[1:16:58] points like we are yet without sin he
[1:17:00] was tempted
[1:17:01] by drinking
[1:17:05] what jesus
[1:17:08] tempted by drinking
[1:17:12] he was tempted by women
[1:17:17] he was tempted by everything
[1:17:20] that could be tempted by he was tempted
[1:17:23] by
[1:17:24] everything that we are he was a man
[1:17:27] and yet he couldn't put a mark you
[1:17:29] couldn't put a mark on him
[1:17:34] that's a perfect man
[1:17:37] now notice overcome means to recognize
[1:17:40] the devil in every one of his tricks
[1:17:43] now notice a lot of people says there is
[1:17:46] no devil it's just a thought don't you
[1:17:48] believe that there's a real devil
[1:17:50] he's just as real as you are anybody a
[1:17:53] real devil
[1:17:54] and you must recognize him real you must
[1:17:57] know he's a devil
[1:17:58] then the same time that you recognize
[1:18:00] him and you know that he's a devil
[1:18:03] he's against you then to overcome you
[1:18:06] must recognize
[1:18:07] that the god in you is greater and
[1:18:10] mightier than he
[1:18:12] is that the one that's in you has
[1:18:14] already overcame him
[1:18:16] and by his grace you are more than a
[1:18:19] match for him amen
[1:18:21] that's real overcoming when you
[1:18:24] recognize
[1:18:26] now notice notice this he said now you
[1:18:29] look back and say well
[1:18:30] i'm doing this and i'm doing that then
[1:18:32] no no no you're defeated
[1:18:35] but there's no condemnation
[1:18:38] to them which are in christ jesus that
[1:18:41] walk not after the flesh but after the
[1:18:43] spirit
[1:18:44] then you realize you've overcame and you
[1:18:46] know that he's a devil you can't say
[1:18:47] well i got a sickness
[1:18:49] i i don't believe it's a sickness
[1:18:52] now this this scripture right here this
[1:18:54] quote
[1:18:55] brought me in the very first moments
[1:18:58] that we were going through the trials of
[1:19:00] spencer family
[1:19:01] this quote right here was life
[1:19:06] there's a lot of people that try to walk
[1:19:08] around and and you'll understand what
[1:19:10] i'm getting ready to say
[1:19:11] as soon as i read this there's a lot of
[1:19:13] people that walk around say well i don't
[1:19:14] got this i don't got this i don't got
[1:19:15] this i don't got this i'm not sick i'm
[1:19:17] not sick
[1:19:18] yeah that's not overcoming
[1:19:22] brother ron didn't walk around and say
[1:19:25] well i ain't got cancer even though
[1:19:26] doctor says it
[1:19:27] he didn't walk around saying i i don't
[1:19:29] have cancer i don't have cancer it's not
[1:19:30] real it's not real it's not real
[1:19:31] i'm not what i'm hearing is not real
[1:19:35] he did not walk around and say i don't
[1:19:37] have cancer i don't have cancer
[1:19:38] but he did walk around and say by his
[1:19:40] stripes i am healed
[1:19:43] i am the lord thy god that heals all of
[1:19:45] thy diseases
[1:19:48] are you with me notice he said let me
[1:19:51] find again he said you know he's the
[1:19:52] devil you
[1:19:53] you can't say i got sickness i don't
[1:19:54] believe it's a sickness oh yes it's a
[1:19:56] sickness
[1:19:57] you got cancer you don't believe it is
[1:20:00] cancer
[1:20:01] it is a cancer it is
[1:20:04] a cancer now i just shut up anybody that
[1:20:09] has to
[1:20:10] has to deal with mind over matter
[1:20:13] but remember greater is he that is in
[1:20:16] you
[1:20:17] than he that is in the world you must
[1:20:19] realize that the holy spirit that's
[1:20:21] in you has already overcame this thing
[1:20:24] and he's in you and you can overcome by
[1:20:27] him
[1:20:28] that's exactly sensible exactly the way
[1:20:31] the scripture
[1:20:32] is written overcome it
[1:20:36] hallelujah
[1:20:41] you can go through your personal battles
[1:20:43] and say well i got delivered last week
[1:20:45] and i
[1:20:46] really got delivered last weekend i
[1:20:48] really got delivered last weekend
[1:20:50] but yet there can still come an enemy
[1:20:52] and whisper in your ear
[1:20:53] and say you really didn't get it
[1:20:56] you really didn't get it he's going to
[1:20:58] do his job but you're going to do your
[1:21:00] job
[1:21:01] you say you are nothing but a lion's
[1:21:03] flew foot
[1:21:04] you are nothing but a liar from your
[1:21:06] birth from your creation
[1:21:08] i am a part of a god that does not lie
[1:21:11] and when god delivers
[1:21:12] god delivers when god heals god heals
[1:21:16] when god sets free god sets free when
[1:21:19] god gives a holy ghost
[1:21:21] god gives a holy ghost
[1:21:31] now i believe everything that the
[1:21:33] prophet said he said the right minor out
[1:21:35] of truth
[1:21:35] toward every divine promise of god will
[1:21:38] bring it to pass
[1:21:40] and he said even even
[1:21:45] if you don't really believe it he said
[1:21:47] just say it
[1:21:48] until you do believe it
[1:21:53] we're not talking the devil's language
[1:21:56] we're not talking what he's given we're
[1:21:58] giving back what he's given
[1:22:00] and we're giving him god's own medicine
[1:22:03] because we've got the greatest example
[1:22:06] that we ever could have had when we got
[1:22:07] jesus up there in matthew chapter 4 and
[1:22:10] luke chapter 4
[1:22:11] when he's standing up there on a mount
[1:22:13] of temptation and satan comes to him
[1:22:15] and he tries to figure out what his
[1:22:17] position was in life
[1:22:19] that's what satan will do to you is try
[1:22:21] to figure out your position
[1:22:22] and he said if you be the son of god
[1:22:24] command these stones to be made bread
[1:22:26] and jesus give him exactly what would
[1:22:29] defeat him
[1:22:30] he gave him the word of god he said man
[1:22:33] shall not live by bread alone
[1:22:35] but by every word that proceeds out of
[1:22:37] the mouth of god
[1:22:38] then satan came and made him another
[1:22:40] offer if you be the son of god
[1:22:43] cast yourself down and the angels will
[1:22:45] carry you up
[1:22:46] he gave him the word he said it is
[1:22:48] written thou shalt not tempt the lord
[1:22:50] thy god
[1:22:51] and he shut him down again because the
[1:22:53] word will defeat satan
[1:22:55] any time any place in any situation
[1:22:58] it's the word it's not your own human
[1:23:01] ability
[1:23:02] it's the word he comes to him and makes
[1:23:06] him another offer
[1:23:07] and he says to him i will give you all
[1:23:09] the kingdoms of this world
[1:23:11] if you'll just bow down and worship me
[1:23:17] get behind me satan
[1:23:20] get behind me satan brother branham
[1:23:22] broke into it
[1:23:23] and said you realize that jesus realized
[1:23:26] that he was going to fall heir to that
[1:23:28] in the millennium
[1:23:31] how can you make jesus bow when he knows
[1:23:33] the future is coming
[1:23:35] how can satan make you bow when you know
[1:23:38] your future
[1:23:39] is nothing but a rapture we're not
[1:23:41] bowing to lay out a seal
[1:23:43] we're not bowing the cancer we're not
[1:23:45] bowing to diseases it's a rapture for us
[1:23:52] he was making him an offer but jesus
[1:23:55] refused
[1:23:56] the devil's offer
[1:24:00] and he'll come to you and make you an
[1:24:02] offer he will offer you religion without
[1:24:04] a new birth
[1:24:05] he will offer you he will offer you a
[1:24:07] motion without real worship
[1:24:09] he will offer you peace without going
[1:24:12] through the pain
[1:24:15] but when jesus makes you an offer it's
[1:24:18] not
[1:24:18] just for this temporary life it's for
[1:24:20] eternity
[1:24:21] and you may not understand why you're
[1:24:24] going through what you're going through
[1:24:28] but god's got your good in his mind
[1:24:35] hallelujah jesus didn't have to tell
[1:24:36] satan who he was
[1:24:38] jesus knew who he was and you don't have
[1:24:40] to tell satan who you are
[1:24:42] you know who you are i'm a child of god
[1:24:46] i'm a child of the most high god
[1:24:50] hallelujah what are you overcoming with
[1:24:54] he didn't use one ounce of his back
[1:24:58] young people you can overcome
[1:25:02] you can overcome and you can make it
[1:25:03] through a battle with one scripture
[1:25:07] if all you know is john 3 16 memorize it
[1:25:11] write it down put it on your
[1:25:13] refrigerator
[1:25:14] put it on your little kitchenaid cabinet
[1:25:17] that you got up there in your little
[1:25:18] play room
[1:25:19] and remember that jesus is the son of
[1:25:22] god
[1:25:25] maybe all you can remember is psalms 23
[1:25:27] write it down
[1:25:28] remember it the lord is my shepherd
[1:25:33] because satan can whip you around on
[1:25:34] your emotions he can whip you around on
[1:25:36] your feelings but he cannot whip you
[1:25:38] around on the word of god
[1:25:40] you just go to quote and if all you know
[1:25:42] is philippians 4 and 13
[1:25:44] that i can do all things through christ
[1:25:45] who strengthens me you keep quoting it
[1:25:48] till you get sick of quoting it and the
[1:25:49] devil will have to go
[1:25:51] because he cannot stay where the word is
[1:25:53] [Applause]
[1:25:56] hallelujah jesus said my word
[1:25:59] is spirit and his life
[1:26:03] life right
[1:26:06] here he stands here he says
[1:26:10] the great and mighty conqueror that's
[1:26:13] overcome all things
[1:26:15] he's unlimited in power he's unlimited
[1:26:18] in truth
[1:26:19] he's unlimited in goodness he's
[1:26:20] unlimited in healing
[1:26:22] he's unlimited in miracles he's
[1:26:23] unlimited in deliverance
[1:26:25] and christ in the true church he's a
[1:26:27] continuation
[1:26:28] of the book of acts
[1:26:32] there has been a word that has spoken
[1:26:35] and there is a people
[1:26:39] that's destined to meet that word
[1:26:42] [Music]
[1:26:46] let me let me i'm a little bit ahead of
[1:26:48] my thinking here
[1:26:50] my brother branham would he would come
[1:26:53] and we we've been speaking to you on
[1:26:54] breaking into another world
[1:26:56] and brother branham said now he said now
[1:26:58] standing before you
[1:27:00] he said there is a demon of doubt
[1:27:05] now let me just illustrate it just for
[1:27:08] your minds just for a moment
[1:27:10] if that would be a person if that would
[1:27:12] be something that you could see
[1:27:14] brother brahma reaching into that world
[1:27:15] he said now standing before you is a
[1:27:17] demon of doubt
[1:27:18] and in one case brother branham is
[1:27:20] standing with a he's dealing with a
[1:27:22] blood
[1:27:23] a person that has a blood sugar excuse
[1:27:27] me i'm just looking through the quotes
[1:27:28] right here
[1:27:29] and he's dealing with a lady that has
[1:27:31] has blood sugar
[1:27:32] and he said he said i see there's blood
[1:27:34] dropping there's blood dropping between
[1:27:36] you and i
[1:27:37] and so brother brandon would say now
[1:27:39] there's a demon of doubt that's standing
[1:27:41] between
[1:27:42] between here he's standing right before
[1:27:44] you now if there's a demon of doubt
[1:27:46] standing before you
[1:27:48] here here here it is if you you've got a
[1:27:51] demon of doubt that's standing before
[1:27:52] you or unbelief that's standing before
[1:27:54] you
[1:27:55] what is he doing he's trying to block
[1:27:57] you from something
[1:28:00] he's trying to keep you from something
[1:28:02] he's trying to create a barrier
[1:28:04] that'll block you from getting to it
[1:28:06] that's what a scarecrow is you remember
[1:28:08] in the cornfield a scarecrow goes up
[1:28:10] it's trying to scare away the crows from
[1:28:11] coming in there
[1:28:13] you see it's a barrier it's trying to
[1:28:14] throw up a bluff to try to keep you out
[1:28:16] of it and brother adam would look into
[1:28:17] that world and he said now
[1:28:18] there's a demon of doubt standing before
[1:28:20] you and then he would break into that
[1:28:23] world
[1:28:23] and say but i see healing for you let's
[1:28:26] go to calvary together
[1:28:28] for a blood transfusion i know a god
[1:28:31] that makes the blood of man
[1:28:33] not doctors not humanity but i know a
[1:28:36] god
[1:28:37] that knows how to make blood and make it
[1:28:39] so perfectly
[1:28:40] that everything elevates and earth and
[1:28:43] works according
[1:28:44] to its plan
[1:28:48] if it's standing before you there's
[1:28:50] something that's trying to keep you out
[1:28:52] of
[1:28:53] but i i've always i've always been
[1:28:55] amazed at this
[1:28:56] when brother branham he he comes and he
[1:28:59] he starts going in
[1:29:01] and he's speaking with a patient and he
[1:29:03] said now
[1:29:04] now standing out there before you is a
[1:29:07] well body
[1:29:10] now look what look what he does he said
[1:29:13] he said now
[1:29:14] he said standing before you is a person
[1:29:16] it's a it's a well body
[1:29:18] he said but jesus is speaking beyond
[1:29:22] that
[1:29:26] what is it he's telling you if you can
[1:29:28] ever walk one time into that well body
[1:29:31] you're gonna go jesus already got a
[1:29:33] future for you he said jesus
[1:29:34] is speaking beyond that well body he
[1:29:37] said all you got to do is walk
[1:29:39] walk and walk into that well body if you
[1:29:42] could ever
[1:29:43] walk into that well body jesus goes
[1:29:46] beyond
[1:29:47] what your plans of humanity is he's
[1:29:50] already in your future
[1:29:53] he's not trying to block you he's trying
[1:29:55] to bring you to something
[1:29:59] but notice notice we as a children of
[1:30:03] god we mind
[1:30:05] the things that are above that's what
[1:30:07] affects you and i
[1:30:08] that's what you're that's what you're
[1:30:10] gathered here for tonight
[1:30:12] it's because you want to be affected by
[1:30:14] the things
[1:30:15] that are from above and being born again
[1:30:18] from above
[1:30:20] then we are active and active in the
[1:30:22] things from above
[1:30:23] and for his life is in us which is a
[1:30:25] word his word of vindicating the word
[1:30:27] itself
[1:30:28] the spirit's in you is the word made
[1:30:31] flesh
[1:30:32] in you the spirit minds the word and is
[1:30:35] active
[1:30:36] in vindicating the word again and why am
[1:30:39] i
[1:30:40] against organized religion he said the
[1:30:42] spirit is trying to find honest hearts
[1:30:44] where the spirit is anxious to manifest
[1:30:47] and prove
[1:30:48] that every word of god is true again he
[1:30:50] says the spirit
[1:30:52] is interested in vindicating the word
[1:30:58] so he's here anxious
[1:31:01] looking for an honest heart
[1:31:05] he can vindicate himself though he's
[1:31:08] interested in vindicating the word
[1:31:11] but if you accepted tradition
[1:31:14] instead of the word he said that's where
[1:31:17] you stop
[1:31:20] you can go no further when you start
[1:31:23] rejecting
[1:31:24] the son of man you can go no further
[1:31:27] when you start accepting religion
[1:31:30] over a new birth you can never go no
[1:31:32] further
[1:31:33] when you accept emotion over a genuine
[1:31:36] experience let me tell you it is a time
[1:31:39] that you start getting claustrophobic
[1:31:41] with the devil
[1:31:43] and he said hey there's not enough room
[1:31:44] in here for me and you
[1:31:46] i'm about to get out of here you ever
[1:31:48] got stuck in a spot say hey it's too
[1:31:50] much
[1:31:51] this is too much for me i'm coming out
[1:31:54] of this thing
[1:31:55] coming out of this set you get the
[1:31:57] digging in a hole
[1:31:58] and you get down there and all of a
[1:31:59] sudden your chest gets heavy
[1:32:01] and you get stuck in a hole and you get
[1:32:04] you can't get out
[1:32:06] because you're getting claustrophobic
[1:32:07] and your your heart starts beating
[1:32:09] faster
[1:32:10] and everything's moving you're getting
[1:32:11] claustrophobic
[1:32:13] it's a time that you start looking at a
[1:32:15] devil and you say there ain't enough
[1:32:16] room in here for me and you
[1:32:18] [Applause]
[1:32:21] if your heart's starting to beat fast
[1:32:22] right now just go ahead and make a
[1:32:24] little room make a little room
[1:32:27] make a little room i'm coming you might
[1:32:29] have to dig
[1:32:30] you might have to crawl you might have
[1:32:32] to get a shovel but now's the time to
[1:32:34] start digging some ditches
[1:32:37] get ready the water's coming you might
[1:32:39] hit a tin can
[1:32:41] but send the holy ghost through there
[1:32:43] and dig it out
[1:32:46] oh hallelujah it ain't enough room in
[1:32:49] here for me and you devil
[1:32:50] but there's plenty of room for the
[1:32:52] fourth man in this fire
[1:32:55] there's plenty of room for the son of
[1:32:56] man
[1:32:59] you might have gotten a thick and thin
[1:33:00] in your trouble but jesus shows up to
[1:33:03] show out
[1:33:10] what are you doing bro andrew what are
[1:33:12] you doing i'm digging
[1:33:15] i'm digging these young people worth
[1:33:16] digging for
[1:33:19] the people that don't get excited about
[1:33:21] this word i'm digging for him
[1:33:24] he might sit there like a bump on a
[1:33:25] pickle or tits on a borehole
[1:33:28] you're not worthless you've got
[1:33:30] something to be proud about
[1:33:32] you're a child of the most hot god if
[1:33:35] this don't make
[1:33:36] you emotional if this don't get you
[1:33:38] excited
[1:33:39] you're dead
[1:33:43] truth hurts baby
[1:33:47] we have the anointed one amongst us it's
[1:33:50] not just on tape
[1:33:51] it's not just on book he has stood
[1:33:54] behind this pulpit
[1:33:57] and we have received an anointed message
[1:34:07] so i just can't get past it
[1:34:11] he come to make a way
[1:34:14] they come to make a way past and when
[1:34:16] brother branham was dealing with a
[1:34:17] sickness
[1:34:18] he's speaking to a patient and don't
[1:34:20] don't understand what's going on
[1:34:21] something wrapped around the optical
[1:34:22] nerve
[1:34:24] he said it's something stopping them
[1:34:27] from seeing
[1:34:28] maybe it's a mother that's got a woman
[1:34:30] shut up and it won't it won't produce
[1:34:32] he said he said it's like it's like an
[1:34:34] invisible band
[1:34:36] that's wrapped around that thing that
[1:34:38] you can't see
[1:34:39] but if you could ever break that thing
[1:34:42] everything will operate the way it's
[1:34:43] supposed to
[1:34:47] and he would step there and he said no
[1:34:49] he said if there would be a great beast
[1:34:51] that would stand here on this pulpit
[1:34:53] and he'd go to hitting me hitting me
[1:34:55] with his paws and claws and digging into
[1:34:57] me
[1:34:58] he said it wouldn't do me no good just
[1:34:59] to cut his hand off cut his claws off
[1:35:02] cut his paws off he said if i could hit
[1:35:04] him in the head
[1:35:05] if i could hit him in the head he would
[1:35:07] finish him right there
[1:35:09] it's not about what you see it's cutting
[1:35:12] the head
[1:35:13] off the demon that's keeping you out of
[1:35:15] the promises
[1:35:17] barriers are only there to stop movement
[1:35:20] and satan has tried to block the channel
[1:35:24] of the birth canal but there is a birth
[1:35:27] that's going to take place
[1:35:28] there's going to be young women there's
[1:35:30] going to be young men
[1:35:31] that will be birthed by the word
[1:35:36] you didn't just walk into a church room
[1:35:38] tonight you walked into a hospital room
[1:35:41] this is the birthing place
[1:35:44] [Applause]
[1:35:44] [Music]
[1:35:47] he's come to birth you into a kingdom
[1:35:49] that'll never let you down
[1:35:50] lay out a seal will let you down you'll
[1:35:53] have faults
[1:35:54] you'll have mistakes but he is birthing
[1:35:56] you into a kingdom
[1:35:57] where you won't fall but he'll lift you
[1:35:59] up
[1:36:02] the reason why people don't get excited
[1:36:06] don't read their bible don't pray don't
[1:36:08] play a tape
[1:36:09] is because they have never went far
[1:36:11] enough
[1:36:16] they have learned to live with the sense
[1:36:19] of religion
[1:36:21] they have learned to live with just okay
[1:36:27] let me get a little bit vulnerable right
[1:36:29] here i know what it's like to live a
[1:36:31] life of okay
[1:36:32] okay just don't cut it
[1:36:36] are you with me okay just don't cut it
[1:36:38] when it comes to being birthed
[1:36:41] you're either in or you're out
[1:36:47] you're either in or you're out
[1:36:51] you're not just saying well i'm going to
[1:36:53] stay up here i'm going to stay up here
[1:36:55] in this womb
[1:36:56] i'm going to stay up here in this earth
[1:36:57] all i want to let me tell you that earth
[1:37:00] is going to be destroyed but if you can
[1:37:03] get
[1:37:03] pushed out
[1:37:07] oh they might have to use type of
[1:37:08] medicines to get that baby to come out
[1:37:11] and jesus might have to take a
[1:37:13] red-headed now an auburn-headed preacher
[1:37:16] to preach you into a new birth but he
[1:37:18] will use some of the most
[1:37:20] unorthodox ways to get you here
[1:37:23] he's not satisfied with where you're
[1:37:25] sitting at he's not satisfied with you
[1:37:28] living an okay life
[1:37:29] still listening to your country music
[1:37:31] still listening to your dog gets told
[1:37:33] still listening to your wife getting
[1:37:35] robbed from you
[1:37:36] and running away with somebody with a
[1:37:38] honky tonk on the truck
[1:37:39] he's not satisfied with you living down
[1:37:42] there
[1:37:43] sleeping with the table and trying to
[1:37:45] get up and live with the angels he's not
[1:37:48] satisfied with filthy living but he
[1:37:52] is the satisfaction of the soul
[1:38:02] you want to push you have to push
[1:38:06] mamas and that is you've been pushing
[1:38:09] you've been pushing
[1:38:10] now it's their part you've been bringing
[1:38:13] them here
[1:38:14] now it's their part it comes a time in
[1:38:17] the birth
[1:38:18] when the baby has got to give way to the
[1:38:21] canal
[1:38:23] [Applause]
[1:38:29] you've been going through the birthplace
[1:38:31] you've been going through the war wars
[1:38:35] it's time to come out you've been trying
[1:38:38] to figure out what in the world's messed
[1:38:40] up in your life
[1:38:41] you've been trying to figure out why i
[1:38:43] keep having these panic attacks
[1:38:45] why to keep going through these
[1:38:46] struggles
[1:38:48] if you can ever press past that barrier
[1:38:52] oh you can never get past yourself
[1:38:56] if you can ever get past it when that
[1:38:59] plane gets to push it
[1:39:01] when it goes against that turbulence
[1:39:03] it's fighting it's struggling
[1:39:06] but if it can never break past that
[1:39:08] sound barrier
[1:39:10] there's an unlimited speed there's
[1:39:13] unlimited power
[1:39:15] if you could ever break past yourself
[1:39:18] brake pass this is more than a hydra
[1:39:20] brake pass this is more than fglt brake
[1:39:23] pass this is just a pastor
[1:39:25] big bass that's just brother ron's son
[1:39:27] break pass that's just brother branham's
[1:39:29] message
[1:39:30] but break past and see that he's
[1:39:32] standing right here
[1:39:34] [Applause]
[1:39:36] hallelujah if you could get caught up
[1:39:39] one time
[1:39:41] you'd stay caught up
[1:39:50] hallelujah some of them were
[1:39:54] satisfied with leaving jericho where it
[1:39:57] was at
[1:40:01] well brother man brother brown comes to
[1:40:04] the destiny and i'm
[1:40:05] i'm completely off my notes but i'm
[1:40:08] hunting
[1:40:10] i'm hunting he comes down credes bernia
[1:40:14] and he starts speaking about the
[1:40:15] judgment seat of the world
[1:40:17] and everybody everybody's pushing

[1:53:12] what the message of joshua has done it's
[1:53:15] laid out that this land of the holy
[1:53:16] ghost
[1:53:17] is for our young people
[1:53:21] and i i can say i could say this i'm i'm
[1:53:24] done i'm completely finished
[1:53:26] i've been finished and i've been off my
[1:53:28] notes for 40 minutes
[1:53:31] but i i'm not i'm not willing
[1:53:34] to to let leo ought to see you go by and
[1:53:38] rob us
[1:53:38] of our young people
[1:53:40] [Music]
[1:53:42] i'm not willing i'm not willing i'm not
[1:53:44] willing for the barriers to be built up
[1:53:47] to stop the move of god
[1:53:51] all throughout my ministry for the last
[1:53:53] 11 12 years i have been
[1:53:54] facing against barriers of the move of
[1:53:57] the holy spirit
[1:53:59] where men have tried to shut us down for
[1:54:01] preaching this word and preaching this
[1:54:03] message
[1:54:05] and tried to stop real worship amen
[1:54:08] what you have here fglt
[1:54:12] is a move of god
[1:54:15] and satan is doing his best to break
[1:54:18] that move
[1:54:19] and bring in barriers he'll try to bring
[1:54:22] in sickness he'll try to bring in
[1:54:23] afflictions he'll try to bring up
[1:54:24] problems
[1:54:25] but there's no trouble great enough to
[1:54:27] keep you from the promises of god
[1:54:31] and i'm not willing that any of uh let
[1:54:34] me say this ain't a young people service
[1:54:35] but it is
[1:54:38] i'm not willing to any of our young
[1:54:39] people go by and now
[1:54:42] and not feel the anointing of god
[1:54:46] i'm not willing to let one service go by
[1:54:49] when we don't have a time when the holy
[1:54:51] ghost moves in this place
[1:54:53] i'm not willing to have one time when we
[1:54:56] don't feel his spirit
[1:54:57] i'm not willing to have one message come
[1:54:59] forth that ain't anointed
[1:55:07] this church these young people your
[1:55:10] loved ones that are still out there
[1:55:12] are worth every energy that you give
[1:55:15] yes and you might have to you might have
[1:55:18] to knock down and you might have to
[1:55:19] crawl
[1:55:23] but they are worth it they are worth it
[1:55:28] brother ron spencer was worth this past
[1:55:31] year and a half of fighting
[1:55:40] he was worth every pain we went through
[1:55:46] every prayer we prayed was not in pain
[1:55:50] every message he has preached has not
[1:55:52] been in vain
[1:55:53] it has been prophetic to say the least
[1:55:56] and christ when he broke through
[1:55:58] two thousand years ago and broke the
[1:56:00] seals of death
[1:56:02] hell and the grave he is showing that
[1:56:05] he's still
[1:56:05] big enough to break the seals of cancer
[1:56:08] off of lives
[1:56:09] he's great enough to break brain bleeds
[1:56:12] he's great enough to break back
[1:56:14] back issues he's great enough to break
[1:56:16] past all the issues of life
[1:56:25] let me tell you i'm not willing i'm not
[1:56:28] willing
[1:56:29] i'm not willing for any formalism i'm
[1:56:32] not willing for any intellectualism
[1:56:33] i'm not i'm not i'm not i'm not
[1:56:35] interested in any form of show
[1:56:39] to come in and try to stop the move of
[1:56:41] god from keeping me from my destination

[1:57:30] i was dragging this big 13 000 pound
[1:57:32] trailer with this
[1:57:34] forward and i was i was getting close to
[1:57:37] my destination
[1:57:38] where i was going for this thing and i
[1:57:41] was coming up these hills and different
[1:57:42] things and i think that forward will it
[1:57:44] will eat the dog man it

[1:57:49] me tell you
[1:57:49] matthew can tell you i'm a guy that
[1:57:52] likes to break barriers
[1:57:55] hope the d.o.t ain't listening
[1:57:59] i don't do that too much more brother
[1:58:01] doug hill likes hearing those stories
[1:58:04] coming out of them hills of west
[1:58:05] virginia on a single axle trailer
[1:58:08] breaking all kinds of things anyways if
[1:58:10] i was coming i was coming up and i was
[1:58:11] coming around with this 13 000 pound
[1:58:13] trailer and that thing's following me
[1:58:15] every which way and i'm getting 20 feet
[1:58:17] from my destination
[1:58:19] and all of a sudden you'd have thought
[1:58:22] that there was something in front of me
[1:58:23] that was stopping me from getting to
[1:58:24] where i was going all of a sudden this
[1:58:26] thing
[1:58:26] locked up and it was it just wasn't
[1:58:28] moving and this guy was pointing me
[1:58:30] where i need to go and here he got to be
[1:58:32] right here
[1:58:33] and i was doing everything i could to
[1:58:35] get there and this thing was locked down
[1:58:36] and i thought man
[1:58:38] i'm this close i'm going all the way
[1:58:42] so i just i mean i like that thing four
[1:58:44] wheel drive and it's still locked down
[1:58:45] as well
[1:58:46] i got enough power in the front of me
[1:58:48] now i'm gonna get this thing where it's
[1:58:49] gotta go i got 20 feet to go and i'm not
[1:58:52] willing that
[1:58:52] anything would hold me back from getting
[1:58:54] there so i just hammered down on that
[1:58:56] thing that
[1:58:57] that dude looked at me said man that
[1:58:59] thing must be heavy i said man it must
[1:59:01] be heavier than i thought
[1:59:03] but you see i got out i got out and i
[1:59:05] was looking this whole thing over and i
[1:59:06] think man
[1:59:07] i know this thing's on a hill when it's
[1:59:09] around the turn and things kind of got a
[1:59:10] little saigon there and i said man what
[1:59:12] the thunder is going on here
[1:59:13] i got out and i was looking it over and
[1:59:16] the thing of it was is there's this
[1:59:18] significant part on the trailer it's
