[40:51] Christ Jesus our
[40:52] lord amen don't you just love that this
[40:55] evening for all things work together
[40:58] every single one of them so this evening
[41:00] I would like to speak on a
[41:02] subject it
[41:04] says oh I have heard your
[41:09] cries and I just want to kind of tell
[41:13] you a little bit of where I draw this
[41:15] thought um the other week I was going
[41:19] down the road and just Li listening to
[41:22] Lamentations and as I would listen to
[41:26] that and about the destruction of
[41:30] Jerusalem and how Jeremiah would write
[41:33] about
[41:35] her I thought of my own self of the year
[41:39] that we've had pasted and some of the
[41:41] things that I've had happen in my life
[41:43] my
[41:45] family and there's been a lot of
[41:49] tribulation a lot of things that's went
[41:51] on that's felt like it's broken
[41:53] us it hurts
[41:58] but an audible Voice come into the
[42:00] vehicle come on and forgive me if I get
[42:02] a little
[42:04] emotional but it said oh I have heard
[42:06] your
[42:07] cries let me tell you what that's right
[42:11] when that presence came to me when that
[42:15] spoke to me no it didn't say I'm going
[42:18] to take care of every single
[42:20] thing but he said oh I have heard your
[42:24] cries and forgive me I feel a little bit
[42:26] like the Prophet Jeremiah a little bit
[42:29] of a weeping prophet this evening
[42:32] because it means a lot to me that he
[42:34] heard me he heard my cries in the middle
[42:37] of the night he heard me in my Despair
[42:40] and things so to lay a foundation on
[42:44] many things of Lamentations uh the
[42:46] author of lamentation is
[42:48] Jeremiah and as uh scoffield would say
[42:51] Lamentations is composed of five elegies
[42:54] lamenta the destruction of Jerusalem
[42:57] the undoubtedly work of Jeremiah in the
[43:01] literary of the chapters 1- 4 are
[43:05] alphabetic somewhat in the order of
[43:08] Psalms
[43:10] 119 thus in chapters 1 and two a new
[43:13] letter in the Hebrew alphabet begins
[43:15] each of the 22 verses in chapter 3 there
[43:19] are 66 verses arranged in 22 groups of
[43:24] three verses each group
[43:27] three verses use the successive letter
[43:31] of the alphabet each verse is in group
[43:35] beginning
[43:36] with that one letter and the fifth
[43:40] chapter although not alphabetically
[43:42] contains 22 verses in a plth meter which
[43:47] is second half of each verse beginning
[43:51] shorter than the first it conveys a
[43:54] somber effect of a DE a domino help me
[43:59] out dominu window
[44:03] effect which in a musical form a
[44:07] diminuendo effect is a gradual decrease
[44:11] from
[44:12] loudness and so as we look in
[44:15] Lamentations here it is as a poem as a
[44:18] song of
[44:20] Lamentations five chapters 22 verses of
[44:24] chapters one two chap CH 3 Jeremiah
[44:29] begins and it almost as he gets carried
[44:32] away in each of what he is saying in
[44:36] chapter 3 and WR 66 vers chapter 4 he
[44:41] then comes back to 22 verses again as
[44:44] same as chapter 5 and as it is said in
[44:48] the dominu window is as it gradually
[44:52] goes from louder to
[44:55] softer and I just think how how
[44:57] beautiful it is that Jeremiah would
[45:00] write this
[45:03] Lamentations of death destruction of
[45:06] Jerusalem of what God had had because
[45:09] Babylon had taken over but it's because
[45:13] and we'll see in chapter two God got
[45:18] angry God is slow to anger but when he
[45:21] gets
[45:21] angry he gets angry and so it continues
[45:26] as though Jerusalem Lady of Zion Oh
[45:30] Daughter of Zion Lady of Jerusalem and
[45:33] as Jeremiah would write these things
[45:36] about Jerusalem in all of the
[45:38] destruction in all of it and he would
[45:42] say and he would write as it is as
[45:45] Jerusalem is speaking out it says oh oh
[45:49] Lord in verse 20 of chapter two of
[45:53] chapter 1 it says oh lord for I am in
[45:55] distress my bows are in my bows are
[45:59] troubled Mine Heart is turned within
[46:03] me for I have grievously rebelled see
[46:06] she had rebelled from what God had told
[46:09] her they had put other gods before thee
[46:13] and God had turned and so death and
[46:17] destruction is what he has written here
[46:21] in chapter two as he's writing about the
[46:23] Lord's anger
[46:28] and I'm just going to paraphrase some of
[46:30] these just to kind of save some time in
[46:32] verse 7 the Lord hath cast off his alar
[46:36] altar he hath aborn her her s Sanctuary
[46:40] he hath given up the hand of the enemies
[46:43] the walls of her places the Lord hath
[46:46] purposed to destroy the wall of the
[46:48] dister daughter of Zion her gates are
[46:51] sunken unto the ground he hath destroyed
[46:55] and broken her bar
[47:00] many times in our lives we feel some of
[47:02] these
[47:04] pains though and it's almost as even
[47:07] like as job had said though God slay me
[47:12] yet I will trust
[47:15] him and in all of this Brokenness in all
[47:19] of the the suffering that Jerusalem is
[47:22] going through that God has put upon her
[47:25] in in verse three chapter 3 excuse me
[47:30] Jeremiah he continues with Jerusalem in
[47:33] her despair but in the center of it now
[47:37] I love this he says this I recall to
[47:40] mind therefore have I
[47:43] hope it is the Lord's
[47:46] mercies that we are not consumed because
[47:50] his compassions they fail
[47:52] not sir oh come on now his compassions
[47:56] they fail
[47:58] not about this time in my heart and I'm
[48:01] reading this and I'm hearing that voice
[48:04] oh I have heard thy cries oh I have felt
[48:07] Broken Oh I have felt lost oh I have
[48:10] felt forgotten but oh I have heard your
[48:14] cries and I can say now like Jeremiah
[48:17] was writing it it is the Lord's Mercy
[48:20] that we are not compassed because his
[48:22] compassions they fail not they are new
[48:26] every morning morning great is thy
[48:30] faithfulness Hall oh how beautiful this
[48:33] is in the center of the
[48:35] destruction Jeremiah writes in these
[48:40] poems in the center of Despair the
[48:44] song Jeremiah gives
[48:46] hope he knows all is not
[48:51] Fallen the Lord is my
[48:54] portion saith my soul yeah therefore I
[48:59] will hope in
[49:01] him the Lord is good unto them that wait
[49:05] for
[49:06] him to the soul that seeketh
[49:09] him aren't you glad that in the middle
[49:12] of your
[49:13] despair that you can look back and you
[49:16] say Jeremiah could write it in the
[49:20] middle of
[49:21] destruction oh great is thy faithfulness
[49:24] oh Lord great is thy faithfulness
[49:28] morning by morning new mercies I see
[49:31] Great Is Thy
[49:36] Faithfulness in Psalms 18
[49:39] and6 and it says in my distress I could
[49:42] hold upon the
[49:43] Lord I cried upon I Cried unto God and
[49:47] he heard my voice out of his Temple and
[49:50] My Cry came before him even unto his
[49:54] ears see David found himself in the
[49:57] midst of the deepest distress and danger
[50:01] and called upon
[50:03] God
[50:05] David right and he had found him as a
[50:10] help in chapter 34 of Psalms it says my
[50:14] eyes of the Lord the eyes of the Lord
[50:16] are upon the righteous and his ears are
[50:21] open to every to their
[50:24] cry aren't you glad of that that his ear
[50:26] ear are open that's right many times
[50:28] when we call upon the Lord I just can
[50:30] think that he turns over and he says oh
[50:33] did you hear what they asked for did you
[50:36] hear what he
[50:38] said in the middle of it all they're
[50:41] still calling upon me in the middle of
[50:44] their
[50:45] despair oh I hear them I have heard your
[50:49] cries and I want to come to you tonight
[50:52] and tell you not just for me but it's
[50:55] saying unto you I have I have heard your
[50:58] cries I have heard every single one of
[51:01] your cries in the middle of the nights
[51:03] for your babies for your lost loved ones
[51:06] for your
[51:08] sicknesses when things look so despair
[51:11] look to this and say he has heard my
[51:16] cries oh he has turned his ear and said
[51:19] oh did you hear what they said did you
[51:22] hear what they asked
[51:24] for see he's not scared of what you ask
[51:27] for he wants you to ask him so ask him
[51:31] ask him for big things don't be scared
[51:33] to ask him ask
[51:36] him in Psalms 139 and4 it says
[51:42] therefore is not the word in my tongue
[51:45] but y oh Lord thou knowest all together
[51:49] thou Hast beset me behind and before and
[51:52] laid up on my hand upon me such
[51:56] knowledge is too wonderful for me it is
[51:59] high I cannot attain unto it whether
[52:02] shall I go from thy Spirit whether shall
[52:06] I flee from thy presence see you can't
[52:09] flee from
[52:10] it if I sin unto Heaven Thou Art there
[52:15] if I make my bed in hell behold Thou Art
[52:19] there if I take wings of the morning and
[52:23] dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea
[52:26] even even there shall thy hand lead
[52:30] me no matter where you
[52:32] go he's
[52:34] there no matter what you do he's there
[52:39] just turn to
[52:41] him he's there for you if you make you
[52:45] bit in Hell he's there you can lift up
[52:47] your eyes and call upon him in in the
[52:50] matter of the darkest of the depths you
[52:52] can call upon the Lord and he hears you
[52:57] brother Brandon would say it remembering
[52:58] the Lord and he said you know oh brother
[53:01] Bosworth used to have the sense of humor
[53:03] and said the baby that cries the loudest
[53:07] gets the most attention so that's kind
[53:09] of the whole lot you know so I think it
[53:13] pays us to cry a little bit once in a
[53:15] while don't you think so see even in the
[53:19] middle of Lamentations even in the
[53:21] middle of the crying God heard Jeremiah
[53:25] even in the middle of at all it pays to
[53:28] cry a little bit it's okay to cry a
[53:30] little
[53:31] bit sometimes you you would think oh
[53:33] well you got to be strong you got to be
[53:35] oh I don't want to show any emotion I
[53:37] I'm a
[53:41] man I had a little bit of a a tear
[53:44] session myself last
[53:47] night I'm a
[53:49] man I try to hold everything in that I
[53:53] can We're Men We hold it
[53:57] amen it's very
[53:58] tough but I have to say there is
[54:02] times and last night was one of
[54:06] them I had to have myself a good
[54:09] cry not only for what I've been through
[54:12] but also for what he's given
[54:15] me that's right he's done more for me
[54:19] than I've ever done for
[54:20] [Applause]
[54:22] him I can't give him praise enough
[54:26] [Applause]
[54:29] right I can't give him praise
[54:31] enough oh he's been so good to
[54:40] me oh he's so good so I Cried unto the
[54:44] Lord and he heard
[54:46] me he helped
[54:50] me though God slay me yet I'll trust
[54:53] him and job would say it like this
[54:56] he said but he knoweth the way that I
[55:02] take when he hath tried me I shall come
[55:05] forth as
[55:08] gold thank you
[55:10] Lord let me tell you it
[55:12] hurts come on it hurts but you're the
[55:17] winners every single one of you are the
[55:21] winners because at the end of it we
[55:24] shall come forth as
[55:29] gold you know this is the part of the
[55:32] sermon where I I say my
[55:35] testimony I can't explain it I would
[55:39] love to be able to give it to brother
[55:40] Gabriel but there's some parts of my
[55:44] testimony that it can't be told but when
[55:47] I get to thinking about what my god did
[55:49] for
[55:50] me when I get to thinking about where he
[55:53] pulled me from
[55:56] my testimony I can shout about it I can
[56:00] praise about
[56:01] it I can look at Brother Devon sister
[56:04] Dylan many others I can praise with them
[56:07] but when I get to thinking about my
[56:10] testimony about what my god did for
[56:14] me excuse me I get a little
[56:18] excited I get a little emotional about
[56:21] my
[56:23] testimony and maybe you should too get a
[56:25] little excited see I don't know where a
[56:28] lot of you come from but I know where a
[56:30] lot of you is
[56:32] going because we can get excited about
[56:35] our
[56:36] testimony not that we want a test and a
[56:39] trial but we can get excited about at
[56:42] the end of it oh my God is with me he's
[56:46] never forsaken me he has never failed me
[56:50] oh he's new Every Morning aren't you

[1:14:34] you you come get me out of here
[1:14:36] okay uh let's begin reading and they
[1:14:38] came over unto the other side of the sea
[1:14:41] into the country of the gatherin and
[1:14:43] when he was come out of the ship
[1:14:45] immediately there met him out of the
[1:14:47] tombs a man with an unlean Spirit who
[1:14:51] had his dwelling among the tombs and no
[1:14:52] man could bind him know not with chains
[1:14:55] because that he had often because he had
[1:14:57] been often bound with feathers and
[1:14:59] chains and the chains had been plucked
[1:15:01] as by him and the FEDS broken in pieces
[1:15:04] neither could any man tame him and
[1:15:07] always night and day he was in the
[1:15:08] mountains and in the tombs crying and
[1:15:11] cutting himself with stones but when he
[1:15:13] saw Jesus AAR off he ran and worshiped
[1:15:18] him and cried with a loud voice and said
[1:15:21] what have I to do with it Jesus thou son
[1:15:24] of the most high God
[1:15:25] iure theee by God that thou torment me
[1:15:28] not and he said unto him come out of the
[1:15:30] man thou unclean spirit and he asked him
[1:15:33] what is thy name and he answered saying
[1:15:35] my name is Legion for we are many and he
[1:15:39] besought him much that he would not send
[1:15:40] him away out of the country now there
[1:15:43] was nigh into the mountains a great herd
[1:15:45] of swine
[1:15:46] feeding and all the Devils besought him
[1:15:48] saying send us into the swine that we
[1:15:50] may enter into them and forth with Jesus
[1:15:53] gave them leave and the CLE Spirits went
[1:15:55] out and entered into the swine and the
[1:15:57] herd ran violently down a steep Place
[1:16:00] into the sea they were about 2000 and
[1:16:03] were choked in the sea and they that fed
[1:16:06] and they that fed the swine fled and
[1:16:07] told it in the city and in the country
[1:16:09] and they went out to see what it was
[1:16:12] that was done and I love this part and
[1:16:14] they came to Jesus and see him that was
[1:16:17] possessed with a devil and had the
[1:16:20] legion sitting en clothed in his right
[1:16:23] mind
[1:16:25] and they were afraid and they that saw
[1:16:28] it told them how it befell of him that
[1:16:29] was possessed with the devil and also
[1:16:31] concerning the swine and they begin to
[1:16:33] pray him to depart out of their coast
[1:16:37] and when he was com to the ship he that
[1:16:39] was possessed with the devil prayed him
[1:16:42] that he might be with them how be it
[1:16:44] Jesus suffered him not but saith unto
[1:16:47] him go home to thy
[1:16:49] friends and tell them that how great
[1:16:52] things the Lord hath done for them the
[1:16:55] and hath had compassion on thee and he
[1:16:58] departed and be to publish and to capis
[1:17:02] how great things Jesus had done for him
[1:17:04] and all men did Marvel amen God bless
[1:17:07] you as you're
[1:17:08] seated with the help of the Lord i' like
[1:17:10] to just title this over the next few
[1:17:12] minutes the Apostle of
[1:17:15] gatera brother brandham said brother BR
[1:17:18] preached a sermon called the maniac of
[1:17:22] gadera now we're taught that Apostle me
[1:17:24] means one that is sent now Paul and
[1:17:27] James both Justified Abraham but Paul
[1:17:31] Justified Abraham by what God seen and
[1:17:34] James Justified him by what man seen by
[1:17:37] his
[1:17:38] works so here I'd like to take a look at
[1:17:40] the life of Legion that when man looked
[1:17:44] at Legion they seen a maniac but when
[1:17:47] God looked at Legion he seen the
[1:17:49] potential of an
[1:17:51] apostle when man sees a Shepherd boy God
[1:17:54] sees a king when man saw a murdering
[1:17:57] Pharisee God seen the the the the
[1:17:59] messenger of the first church age when
[1:18:02] man sees you and your
[1:18:04] Humanity God sees a Perfect
[1:18:08] Bride so to get the background of the
[1:18:10] story Jesus is tired from all the
[1:18:12] meetings they're pulling on him you've
[1:18:15] got the pull brother Matthew could you
[1:18:16] get me a bottle of water please thank
[1:18:18] you you have the pool of the people
[1:18:20] where the people wanted Want Jesus to do
[1:18:22] one thing but Jesus said he only does
[1:18:25] that which the father shows him so it
[1:18:27] was a constant struggle in his humanity
[1:18:29] and it drained his energy to have to
[1:18:32] make sure that he always does what God
[1:18:33] wanted him to do and he was Healing The
[1:18:36] Sick he was thank you he was casting out
[1:18:43] Devils he began to preach great deep
[1:18:47] Revelations about the kingdom of heaven
[1:18:49] and he'd say a swer went out to
[1:18:51] seow and all this really be to wear on
[1:18:54] his body but after a while Jesus must
[1:18:56] have looked up and said let us now pass
[1:18:58] to the other
[1:19:00] side let us now go to the other side
[1:19:03] because there was one man on the other
[1:19:06] side that was crying
[1:19:07] out and his cries had awoken the
[1:19:11] master Jesus was having a Revival there
[1:19:13] and he was getting tired and he went and
[1:19:15] he said let's go to the other side and
[1:19:17] they got in a
[1:19:19] boat and they were headed to the other
[1:19:21] side and Satan knew something was going
[1:19:23] on and he he brought about a storm he
[1:19:26] got he's the prince of the power of the
[1:19:28] air and he got into the storm and he
[1:19:31] tried to sink that boat we just sung
[1:19:32] about
[1:19:33] it and the boat was filling up and Jesus
[1:19:36] was so tired and so worn out he was
[1:19:39] asleep in the boat but brother Randall
[1:19:42] the cries of the disciples went and said
[1:19:44] care not that we perish right in one
[1:19:46] spot brother R said Jesus wasn't really
[1:19:48] sleeping he he was tired but maybe at
[1:19:50] that moment he was laying awake waiting
[1:19:52] for them to come and get him
[1:19:55] waiting for them to realize that they
[1:19:57] needed more than their than their
[1:19:59] Boatman expertise to handle the
[1:20:02] situation and he put that foot on the
[1:20:04] bril and he said peace be
[1:20:07] still because an elected seed of God was
[1:20:10] crying out to
[1:20:13] him brother Braham said one day way down
[1:20:16] in the land of gadia No Doubt
[1:20:18] associable God-fearing citizen once
[1:20:21] lived and he got out with the wrong
[1:20:23] crowd maybe just married and had to two
[1:20:24] or three little kides and he got mixed
[1:20:26] up in the wrong
[1:20:27] group and that's where many a young man
[1:20:30] and a young woman loses out getting
[1:20:31] mixed up in the wrong group young people
[1:20:34] watch your
[1:20:36] friends watch your
[1:20:39] friends because Legion was maybe raised
[1:20:42] in a Christian
[1:20:43] home but he didn't watch his
[1:20:46] friends and they begin to take him down
[1:20:48] a wrong path and it started with one
[1:20:50] devil and ended up as a
[1:20:53] legion to took him away from his family
[1:20:55] took him away from his
[1:20:57] friends but
[1:20:59] Jesus had need to go by
[1:21:03] Galeria he had need to go by gadera just
[1:21:06] as he just as he had needs to go by
[1:21:08] Samaria it was the same
[1:21:10] cry he said so one night they taken him
[1:21:13] out and give him a little drink go play
[1:21:15] a little game do this or gamble it won't
[1:21:16] hurt the first devil entered him on he
[1:21:19] went home and had to tell his wife a lie
[1:21:22] the second devil entered into him on and
[1:21:24] on till he was possessed with a legion
[1:21:26] and he got Beyond any help and the poor
[1:21:28] fellow was drove out into the
[1:21:32] tombs but the cry had awoken the
[1:21:37] master Jesus will leave an entire crowd
[1:21:41] just for
[1:21:42] you do you know that Jesus Will
[1:21:44] orchestrate an entire church service
[1:21:46] just for you if he has
[1:21:49] to do you know that he would send his
[1:21:51] Prophet into a city for one person amen
[1:21:55] do you know that in the book of Acts
[1:21:57] Philip was having a wonderful Mighty
[1:21:58] Revival brother said the demons were
[1:22:00] screaming out people were being healed
[1:22:02] and God took him from that Revival and
[1:22:05] brought him down to
[1:22:06] one black Ethiopian unic there by his
[1:22:11] Chariot God left thousands of people
[1:22:13] having a wonderful time for one person
[1:22:16] he sure
[1:22:17] did because look whenever because this
[1:22:20] Ethiopian needed some some light on the
[1:22:22] scripture he was reading the book OFA
[1:22:24] Isaiah and didn't know if he was talking
[1:22:26] about Isaiah or who who was Isaiah
[1:22:28] talking
[1:22:29] about he as he asked Philip that and
[1:22:31] Philip opened up the scriptures to him
[1:22:33] and then that man became an apostle of
[1:22:36] Ethiopia he was able to go back because
[1:22:38] he was a man of great
[1:22:40] rank he was of great Authority the
[1:22:43] scripture says under Candace the queen
[1:22:44] of the
[1:22:46] Ethiopians who had charge of all of her
[1:22:48] treasure and had come to Jerusalem for
[1:22:50] worship God left God had Philip leave
[1:22:53] that entire meeting for one but in the
[1:22:56] darkness of gadera he had an elected Son
[1:22:58] of God crying out from under the Legion
[1:23:01] of demons that was covering him right
[1:23:04] you think about
[1:23:06] this he said seeing this brother
[1:23:08] speaking he says seeing this poor old
[1:23:10] fellow Legion out there maybe once in a
[1:23:12] while he'd come to himself he'd just
[1:23:14] look and say what am I doing
[1:23:17] here think about that
[1:23:21] amen here you have a man that has
[1:23:25] backslid on God right and every now and
[1:23:28] then he'd get just enough of a breath of
[1:23:30] fresh air to say what am I doing
[1:23:37] here look these chains all around them
[1:23:40] and things like that my body all cut up
[1:23:42] then the devil would throw him in a
[1:23:44] spell and here he would go maybe he'd
[1:23:47] come to himself again and think I've got
[1:23:49] a wife and
[1:23:51] children and let let me just preach here
[1:23:53] for a little bit I don't care how
[1:23:55] backslid you are I don't care how cold
[1:23:58] you've got on God I don't care if you
[1:24:01] got a beer bottle in your hand right
[1:24:03] now when you come to yourself cry
[1:24:08] out when you have that moment of
[1:24:12] sanity and you have that moment of
[1:24:14] recollection and say my God how far have
[1:24:16] I have I backslid I never would have
[1:24:19] guessed I'd be in this sin cry out to
[1:24:22] them
[1:24:24] cry out to him because your cries will
[1:24:27] awaken the
[1:24:31] master if you still have a if you still
[1:24:33] have a call of God on your on your life
[1:24:35] and you still have a thirst for God he's
[1:24:37] not done with you
[1:24:38] yet no matter how bad you back live when
[1:24:41] you have that sober moment and I just
[1:24:43] don't mean when it comes to alcohol but
[1:24:45] when you have that sober moment when you
[1:24:46] come to yourself and you say what am I
[1:24:51] doing at that moment you cry out
[1:24:56] Hallelujah you cry out and then you get
[1:24:58] to God you cry out and then you go to
[1:25:01] your
[1:25:02] church you ask for help but you got to
[1:25:05] cry
[1:25:06] out don't let the condemnation of the
[1:25:09] enemy and your guilt keep you chained
[1:25:11] down cry out to him regardless of your
[1:25:16] condition now when Jesus came Legion
[1:25:20] cried out and Jesus came but then even
[1:25:22] when Jesus came to the shore brother R
[1:25:24] said that Legion he said them Devils
[1:25:26] would have never come if Legion hadn't
[1:25:29] pushed his way out there to meet
[1:25:32] him he got Jesus to the shore but Legion
[1:25:35] then had to make his way to the
[1:25:39] master and I have this here in my notes
[1:25:41] brother Andrew Georgie
[1:25:45] Carter he heard her
[1:25:48] cry and he sent a prophet from out Miles
[1:25:52] and Miles Away didn't even know where
[1:25:54] was on a map
[1:25:56] amen but he knew one of God's Lambs were
[1:25:59] in
[1:26:00] trouble Jesus heading to Jerusalem with
[1:26:03] his mind was fixed on Calvary and blind
[1:26:07] Bemus
[1:26:09] blind heard all the screaming and all
[1:26:11] the commotion and he asked who is that
[1:26:14] and finally a kind woman said that
[1:26:15] that's that's the
[1:26:17] Messiah and blind bmus sees his
[1:26:21] moment out of his Darkness he cried
[1:26:24] thou son of
[1:26:26] David have mercy on
[1:26:29] me and the Bible specifically says that
[1:26:33] Jesus Stood Still
[1:26:36] right he was going this way his mind was
[1:26:39] toward
[1:26:40] Calvary he knew what the father wanted
[1:26:42] him to do but over all the screams over
[1:26:46] all the mockings over all the criticism
[1:26:49] one little man sitting down even right C
[1:26:54] Li out to him and Jesus stopped in his
[1:27:01] tracks
[1:27:03] now Legion is
[1:27:07] delivered but his community is not happy
[1:27:10] for
[1:27:11] him his neighbors aren't pleased because
[1:27:13] they lost an investment of
[1:27:18] hogs that's
[1:27:21] sad you have a man that's out of his
[1:27:23] mind that's naked and and wants to kill
[1:27:25] you if he can get his hands on you and
[1:27:27] all he's delivered and you're worried
[1:27:29] about your Hogs right come but that's
[1:27:33] the way it
[1:27:34] was and they wanted Jesus to leave we
[1:27:37] don't want you here so Legion runs up
[1:27:40] and he says Master let me follow
[1:27:44] you now in our way of thinking we' have
[1:27:46] thought he would have been a good trade
[1:27:47] for Judas is a care it wouldn't
[1:27:49] we he would have been a good
[1:27:52] tradeoff but Judas had a job
[1:27:56] too and God had a job for
[1:28:00] Legion so he told him go home to thy
[1:28:03] friends and tell them how great things
[1:28:06] the Lord did done for thee and have
[1:28:08] compassion on
[1:28:14] thee and he departed and begin to
[1:28:16] publish and DEC capulus how great things
[1:28:19] Jesus had done for him and all men did
[1:28:23] Marvel
[1:28:25] I'm sure his testimony rang out a lot
[1:28:27] like the woman at the
[1:28:28] well whenever he had needs to go by
[1:28:31] Samaria and he began to discern her life
[1:28:32] and she runs and says come see a man
[1:28:34] that's told me everything I've ever done
[1:28:37] and when he went through all throughout
[1:28:38] all Decap he said come see a man let me
[1:28:40] tell you about a man come on because see
[1:28:44] legion's testimony had way more weight
[1:28:47] in decapolis than it would have anywhere
[1:28:49] else because they knew who he once
[1:28:52] was now Decap was a region it wasn't
[1:28:55] just a city it was a region of about 10
[1:28:57] cities like we would say the shannona
[1:29:00] valley and then you've got cities within
[1:29:02] that you've got Harrisonburg and and
[1:29:05] Waynesboro and and the big city of Gros
[1:29:07] and all them
[1:29:10] places you've got little places within
[1:29:13] that area and he went throughout let's
[1:29:15] just say throughout the entire shanida
[1:29:17] Valley up and
[1:29:21] down now legion's testimony begin with
[1:29:24] his
[1:29:25] family and that's where your testimony
[1:29:27] becomes come on when you become a
[1:29:29] different husband when you become a
[1:29:31] different Dad when you become a
[1:29:33] different man when you become a
[1:29:34] different mom and a wife that is where
[1:29:37] your testimony begins because it's your
[1:29:39] family are the ones that really know you
[1:29:41] and when they see a change they know
[1:29:43] it's
[1:29:44] real when your spouse comes home a
[1:29:47] different person you're going to be the
[1:29:49] first one to know
[1:29:51] it brother Ram dramatizes a little bit
[1:29:53] and I'm trying to
[1:29:55] hurry he says could you imagine Legion
[1:29:58] coming back down to his own home and
[1:30:00] finding where he used to live the little
[1:30:02] wife had to sell the place and he
[1:30:04] wondered where she was at so he searched
[1:30:06] from place to place finally somebody
[1:30:08] said she lives down in the alley and
[1:30:10] when he goes down there in a little tin
[1:30:12] Shack When the Children see him coming
[1:30:14] they run to hide from their own
[1:30:17] dad the wife grabbed her up her little
[1:30:19] Shaw and put on her and started out the
[1:30:21] gate and he said never mind mind honey
[1:30:24] never mind children come here to Daddy I
[1:30:28] want to take you on my arms I want to
[1:30:32] put my arms around you sweetheart your
[1:30:34] little dresses tore off oh she said what
[1:30:36] happened he said Jesus came
[1:30:39] along that's what made the difference oh
[1:30:42] wife babies come here it was the darkest
[1:30:44] time the Devils were tormenting me then
[1:30:48] Jesus came
[1:30:51] along one time brother Brandon went and
[1:30:54] he had a little breakfast there with a
[1:30:55] bunch of preachers and Billy Graham was
[1:30:57] the head
[1:30:58] speaker and Billy Graham took his Bible
[1:31:01] like this and he said this is God's
[1:31:06] blueprint and he said I go into a
[1:31:09] city and he said I have 30,000
[1:31:13] converts I come back to this city in a
[1:31:16] year and I can't find
[1:31:20] 30 he said Paul would have one convert
[1:31:23] in the city
[1:31:25] and he'd go back the next year and he'd
[1:31:26] have 30 or so forth from that
[1:31:31] one and he said what's the matter and
[1:31:33] Billy Graham blamed the ministers for
[1:31:36] not following up the
[1:31:38] leads and the prophet just sat there and
[1:31:40] there was a prophet of the
[1:31:43] age and he kept humble he wanted to say
[1:31:47] something so bad but that was Billy
[1:31:48] Graham's
[1:31:49] breakfast he was a
[1:31:52] gentleman but to his own audience and to
[1:31:54] the bride he said he he respected
[1:31:56] brother Billy Graham for his stand on
[1:31:58] the word but he said oh how I wish I
[1:32:00] could have asked
[1:32:02] him who what what ministers went and
[1:32:05] chased down the Converse that Paul had
[1:32:08] he said what was it he said Paul took
[1:32:10] them further into the
[1:32:12] word where they themselves became sent
[1:32:15] and then they went and told others and
[1:32:17] then they went and told others because
[1:32:18] it was a reality of life and it wasn't
[1:32:21] just come shake my hand you're born
[1:32:23] again you're born again you're born
[1:32:24] again it was a
[1:32:27] reality without reality what do we
[1:32:30] have
[1:32:33] religion
[1:32:37] Glory with reality you have
[1:32:41] everything you have
[1:32:44] everything praise the Lord
[1:32:47] Jesus Legion had
[1:32:50] reality come on he had reality in his
[1:32:53] life he was able to go tell others you
[1:32:55] talk about a a house firing a windy day
[1:32:59] you couldn't put Legion out neither can
[1:33:02] you put this bride
[1:33:04] out neither can you put the ministry out
[1:33:07] the true five-fold
[1:33:08] Ministry you can't put her
[1:33:12] out it was
[1:33:14] him now we took our text in Mark chapter
[1:33:19] 5 and after Legion was delivered and
[1:33:22] crowds wanted him to leave
[1:33:25] because the power the kind of power and
[1:33:27] authority that Jesus
[1:33:28] had was too strong for
[1:33:31] them so Jesus heard the Cry of one
[1:33:34] man buried underneath 2,000
[1:33:40] Devils he gave him a true conversion an
[1:33:43] elected seed of God and
[1:33:47] left and he told that
[1:33:49] man you can't follow me that's not your
[1:33:52] place to be one of the 12 dis
[1:33:54] deciples he said but you go publish it
[1:33:58] right you go be an apostle
[1:34:01] right less than a year later in the very
[1:34:04] next
[1:34:07] chapter or two chapters
[1:34:10] over Jesus returns to the
[1:34:13] area and 4,000 people come to meet
[1:34:19] him four thou he ends up feeding 4,000
[1:34:24] people in that area let's read it Mark
[1:34:28] 7 verse 31 and again departing from the
[1:34:32] coast of Tyree and sidon he came unto
[1:34:34] the Sea of Galilee through the midst of
[1:34:36] the coast of decapus and they bring him
[1:34:39] unto him one that was deaf and had an
[1:34:40] impediment in his speech and they
[1:34:41] beseech him to put his hand on him and
[1:34:44] he took him aside from the multitude and
[1:34:46] put his fingers in his ears and he spit
[1:34:48] and touched his tongue and looking up to
[1:34:49] heaven he sighed and said unto them
[1:34:52] ephr and that is be open and straight
[1:34:56] way his ears were open and the string of
[1:34:58] his tongue was loosed and he spake
[1:35:02] plain and he charged them that he should
[1:35:04] tell no man but the more he charged them
[1:35:07] so much the more a great deal they
[1:35:09] published it Hallelujah God knows how
[1:35:11] people
[1:35:13] are this a secret don't you tell
[1:35:19] nobody but God uses it this time for his
[1:35:22] glory
[1:35:26] and in Mark chapter
[1:35:28] 8 you can just jot it down but in Mark
[1:35:30] chapter 8 is where he feeds the 4,000
[1:35:32] with seven Loaves and
[1:35:34] Fishes we don't know what 2025 will
[1:35:38] hold but there's a couple things you can
[1:35:40] be confident in one is it'll get darker
[1:35:43] for the
[1:35:45] world new president coming in office New
[1:35:48] political change doesn't matter it'll
[1:35:51] get worse for the world
[1:35:54] but for the bride it's a totally
[1:35:56] different
[1:35:57] story it's going to get better for
[1:35:59] you there's going to be more light on
[1:36:02] the word you're going to get more faith
[1:36:03] you're going to be healed you're going
[1:36:05] to be delivered and one of these
[1:36:07] mornings you're going to be
[1:36:09] [Applause]
[1:36:11] gone may this be the year for the coming
[1:36:14] of the
[1:36:16] Lord may we be Apostles of our Lord
[1:36:18] Jesus
[1:36:20] Christ if Legion in less than a year
[1:36:22] could tear up the country like he
[1:36:24] did what about
[1:36:28] us what about the life that we
[1:36:31] live and how that preaches to
[1:36:34] people now in closing let me say
[1:36:38] this sometimes storms CL come and
[1:36:40] they'll change your
[1:36:43] plans do you know that whenever Jesus
[1:36:45] told
[1:36:47] them he said you go on
[1:36:49] ahead you go to Betha
[1:36:53] y'all go on ahead and I'll meet you
[1:36:55] there and they were going there remember
[1:36:59] they didn't have Jesus in the boat he
[1:37:00] went in the mountain to pray and Satan
[1:37:01] gets in that storm
[1:37:03] again and Jesus begins walking on the
[1:37:06] water and he comes in the boat and he
[1:37:08] calms the storm again
[1:37:11] again do you realize in the scripture
[1:37:13] they actually never went to Betha the
[1:37:15] storm blew them somewhere
[1:37:18] else the storm blew them to jerus if I'm
[1:37:21] pronouncing that right but God didm him
[1:37:23] Miracles there
[1:37:25] too and this story brother Ron reminds
[1:37:28] me of even you you were doing what God
[1:37:31] told you to do he called you to preach
[1:37:34] his
[1:37:35] message but a storm came up one you
[1:37:38] didn't ask
[1:37:40] for but yet God used the storm to use
[1:37:43] you like never
[1:37:46] before and people in that City that they
[1:37:49] ended up the storm ended up blowing them
[1:37:51] in were healed delivered and God still
[1:37:53] had the glory god still made it over
[1:37:55] there to Beta but you see how the storm
[1:37:58] blew him my course Jesus wasn't
[1:38:00] concerned when they got to the shores of
[1:38:02] jeser say boys y'all's navigation is
[1:38:06] terrible come on the Bible says that the
[1:38:10] people knew him and they ran to
[1:38:13] him God has some business to
[1:38:16] do let's stand to our feet amen thank
[1:38:19] you Lord
[1:38:24] I'm also reminded in closing of a quote
[1:38:26] that brother Bram said
[1:38:28] about he said many of you are here and
[1:38:32] I'm paraphrasing but he said many of you
[1:38:34] are here because of a decision you made
[1:38:36] five years
[1:38:39] ago and he talks about the power of a
[1:38:42] decision today and where you'll be five
[1:38:44] years from now brother Ron you read that
[1:38:48] quote I've never forgotten it because
[1:38:51] it's a powerful quote
[1:38:54] think of how many of us are here because
[1:38:56] of a decision you've made within 5 years
[1:38:58] maybe
[1:39:00] longer so the the importance of a
[1:39:02] decision is very very
[1:39:05] important it's a decision is powerful
[1:39:09] and if you're on the fence with God as
[1:39:11] as the expression
[1:39:13] goes if you if you do feel like you're
[1:39:15] getting cold and you do feel like Satan
[1:39:16] is trying is trying his best to get you
[1:39:19] from that redh hot condition because
[1:39:20] remember that's Le a DEA is lukewarm
[1:39:23] amen then may this be a year of
[1:39:27] rededication
[1:39:30] reconsecration to where God can make you
[1:39:32] an apostle of your home where whatever
[1:39:36] your influence is it doesn't have to be
[1:39:38] you know whatever influence God has
[1:39:40] given you in your home your mother with
[1:39:42] children or on the job or co-workers
[1:39:45] take
[1:39:46] that and be an apostle unto the Lord
[1:39:49] Jesus God bless you tonight amen thank
[1:39:53] you
[1:39:57] Lord
[1:40:01] hallelujah amen praise the
[1:40:04] Lord Brother William was speaking this
[1:40:08] song just kept reeling in my mind and I
[1:40:11] think I've only ever sang it once so
[1:40:13] we'll see if I can sing it again
[1:40:17] KC think about I I've always loved the
[1:40:19] story of Legion just how powerful it is
[1:40:22] you know and I always always thought
[1:40:25] what was amazing to me is that that
[1:40:27] Legion even in his bound condition he
[1:40:30] could
[1:40:31] say thou most high God it's the same
[1:40:34] language that Abraham uses when he's
[1:40:36] talking to MDC now what was on the
[1:40:39] inside of him amen can you see as I look
[1:40:44] back over my life and I think things
[1:40:48] over I can truly say he brought me all

[1:47:58] my bride you are the one that I have
[1:48:01] called by my name you are the one it's
[1:48:04] time we stop crying and let's start
[1:48:06] moving forward in Jesus Christ I'm not
[1:48:09] saying that we don't cry out to God but
[1:48:11] we identify who we are and it's time we
[1:48:14] step in what God said we were amen we
[1:48:17] ain't got to back down any longer saints
[1:48:19] of God we are the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:48:22] he's identified us does that mean we
[1:48:25] don't have problems no that doesn't mean
[1:48:27] we don't have problems but we've got a
[1:48:29] God that's walking with
[1:48:34] us the Bible says
[1:48:36] steps so that's not one step amen we
[1:48:40] don't believe in a one-step program well
[1:48:42] I made it to church that's good
[1:48:45] enough what brother William was talking
[1:48:47] about a new birth why don't you walk all
[1:48:50] the way to a new birth you made a been
[1:48:53] to the altar you may have had a life
[1:48:55] change but that's not good enough you
[1:48:57] got to be cleansed you got to be filled
[1:48:59] and you got to be walking where God can
[1:49:02] speak through you take another step
[1:49:05] tonight I don't know where you're at but
[1:49:07] this is your service to take a step
[1:49:10] let's move into this new year a
[1:49:12] different
[1:49:15] person let's go to Joshua I want to
[1:49:19] catch this scripture you it's been a
[1:49:20] little while since I preached that
[1:49:23] anointing is real let me tell you and I
[1:49:25] love
[1:49:27] it I love it say of God Joshua chapter
[1:49:31] one brother brenon would take a Bible
[1:49:33] and he'd pick a Bible up all the time
[1:49:35] and this is where he would go amen pull
[1:49:38] that up for
[1:49:39] me shaking my
[1:49:42] goodness you love the Lord amen Joshua
[1:49:46] chapter one verse
[1:49:48] one now after the death of Moses the
[1:49:51] servant of the Lord it came to pass that
[1:49:52] the the Lord spake un to Joshua the son
[1:49:54] of n Moses Minister saying Moses my
[1:49:57] servant is dead now therefore rise go
[1:50:00] over this Jordan you know many people
[1:50:02] have stayed with brother Brandon being
[1:50:04] the
[1:50:05] prophet and they've never walked on to
[1:50:07] the Holy Ghost themselves they identify
[1:50:10] that there is a message they identify
[1:50:13] that there was Malachi 4 but they never
[1:50:15] take the steps thems and get the baptism
[1:50:18] of the Holy Ghost that now they are a
[1:50:20] living breathing Jesus Christ Living and
[1:50:24] walking the same steps that he did the
[1:50:26] works that I do ye shall do also saints
[1:50:30] of God that is where we should be
[1:50:32] walking and if we're not walking it's
[1:50:34] not because the word isn't true it's
[1:50:37] because we need to die out more to self
[1:50:39] that the word of God may be made flesh
[1:50:42] in this end
[1:50:44] time amen verse he said listen he says
[1:50:48] go thou and all he says arise therefore
[1:50:51] arise saints of God it's not time to be
[1:50:54] downtrodden brother the matter I barely
[1:50:56] made it
[1:50:58] through we're not a people of barely
[1:51:00] making it through we're a people that
[1:51:03] have already made it in the mind of
[1:51:05] Jesus Christ in God's mind we're already
[1:51:08] there so while we're here let's walk as
[1:51:12] he would walk let's walk he didn't walk
[1:51:15] to Calvary
[1:51:17] complaining well Glory sorry if you're
[1:51:19] that complainer I just stepped all over
[1:51:21] your toes quit complaining it's time to
[1:51:24] go you're a winner you're saved you're
[1:51:28] Sanctified you're filled with the Holy
[1:51:30] Ghost then take another step God can use
[1:51:35] you Hallelujah let me read all down all
[1:51:39] down in verse nine then we'll go back I
[1:51:41] he says arise over this Jordan thou and
[1:51:43] all thy people unto the land which I do
[1:51:44] give to them even to the children of
[1:51:47] Israel listen to the scripture every
[1:51:51] place no remember brother Brandon would
[1:51:53] pick up a Bible and they'd say open it
[1:51:56] and he would open it to these
[1:51:58] scriptures I do need that water he'd
[1:52:01] open it to those
[1:52:03] scriptures over and over and over and
[1:52:07] over and over again then I say there's
[1:52:10] something there for the bride cuz if it
[1:52:12] was there for the messenger it was there
[1:52:14] for the bride let us recognize every
[1:52:17] place the soul of your foot shall tread
[1:52:19] upon that have I given unto you as I
[1:52:22] said into Moses and from the Wilderness
[1:52:25] and leant even unto the Great River
[1:52:26] river of fres all the land of the
[1:52:28] Hittites and the great sea toward the
[1:52:30] going down of the sun shall be your
[1:52:32] Coast there shall not any man be able to
[1:52:35] stand before thee all the days of our
[1:52:37] life as I was with Moses so will I be
[1:52:40] with you I will not fail thee nor
[1:52:42] forsake
[1:52:43] thee listen to the word of God be strong
[1:52:47] and of good courage for under th people
[1:52:49] shalt thou divide for inheritance of
[1:52:51] land which I swear to their fathers to
[1:52:53] give them only be strong and very
[1:52:57] courageous that thou mayest observe to
[1:52:58] do according to all the law which to
[1:53:01] Moses thy servant commanded thee if the
[1:53:03] Bible says we can do it
[1:53:06] all then I got some people here tonight

[1:53:41] into a new year I don't know about you
[1:53:43] I'm not walking down I'm walking up come
[1:53:47] on somebody I'm walking up out of here

[1:54:21] of God begin to speak to me and the same
[1:54:24] way that Father Abraham walked is the
[1:54:27] same way that I'm walking and it's the
[1:54:29] same way every born again son of
[1:54:32] daughter of God they may not know what
[1:54:33] tomorrow holds but they know who holds
[1:54:36] tomorrow and if God told me that his
[1:54:39] hand is not too short his strength is
[1:54:41] not not diminished at all he's still the
[1:54:44] same yesterday today forever did Abraham
[1:54:48] know every step of the way no he did not
[1:54:50] but he listened to the voice of God
[1:54:54] I don't have time to do this but I
[1:54:56] wanted to put a blindfold on somebody
[1:54:59] and I'm getting to talk to them they
[1:55:02] don't have the sense of their own sight
[1:55:04] they can't see what's going on come on
[1:55:05] somebody sometimes we can't see any
[1:55:08] can't see into the spiritual world of
[1:55:09] what's going on but there's one that
[1:55:12] knows exactly what's going on and he

[2:00:38] God but he's saying to you tonight take

[2:00:56] it's already your
[2:01:02] possession if I told you there's $1,000
[2:01:04] right right here and the first person
[2:01:07] that got it could keep
[2:01:15] it he's like I got all kinds of things I
[2:01:18] can
[2:01:19] buy or save
[2:01:24] bye but all you had to do was take a
[2:01:27] step and go get
[2:01:30] it then if I could tell you everything
[2:01:33] that you have need of is in the building
[2:01:35] that all you got to do is believe and
[2:01:38] they take a step of faith and watch God
[2:01:40] do a miracle right there in your Pew he
[2:01:43] doesn't have to be at the end of the
[2:01:45] service right now you can receive it
[2:01:52] woo
[2:01:56] Glory down to the church ages Jesus has
[2:01:59] been walking how do you know that
[2:02:01] brother Matt Revelations chapter 2 verse
[2:02:03] one it says unto the angel of the Church
[2:02:05] of Ephesus write these things sayth he
[2:02:06] that hold the Seven Stars of his right
[2:02:08] hand who
[2:02:10] walketh let give a little something here
[2:02:12] eth on the end of that means he
[2:02:15] continually
[2:02:16] walkth that's why if you sinth it's not
[2:02:18] bad it's not
[2:02:20] good because you sin but let me tell you
[2:02:24] he's walking he's walking with you he
[2:02:27] was walking with him in Ephesus he
[2:02:29] walked with them when they Mar
[2:02:30] themselves he walk with
[2:02:33] them he walk with them and he's walking
[2:02:36] with you tonight he just needs a walking
[2:02:39] partner how about you raise your hand up
[2:02:42] and say Lord I'll walk with you I'll
[2:02:44] take another step I'll give you my all
[2:02:47] Lord Jesus
[2:02:52] [Music]
[2:02:54] take another step three times it said in
[2:02:56] these scriptures right here be strong
[2:02:58] and very courageous why would it say
[2:03:02] that cuz it's going to be
[2:03:08] hard cuz you got to walk
[2:03:10] against
[2:03:12] am this old boy and this old boy wants
[2:03:15] what this old boy wants but there's a
[2:03:19] God that said be strong and very
[2:03:22] courageous that means don't let your
[2:03:24] faith go down when things get hard don't
[2:03:27] let your faith go down when things get
[2:03:29] to the point that you don't see a way
[2:03:31] out just hold on God said he'd make a
[2:03:34] way out and he's done it time and time
[2:03:37] and time again I think of the Hebrew
[2:03:40] children you think it was
[2:03:42] hard they had the word of Daniel Do Not
[2:03:45] Bow Lord aren't you thankful for the
[2:03:47] word of a
[2:03:48] prophet but it's not just the word of a
[2:03:50] prophet it's the that we have marching
[2:03:52] orders to it's what we step
[2:03:58] to Matthew talked about those trials
[2:04:00] he's been through in the whole time
[2:04:04] maybe unconsciously he didn't know God
[2:04:07] was right there with him and he stepped
[2:04:09] into the
[2:04:12] car and let you know I'm right there
[2:04:15] with him so it doesn't matter what you
[2:04:16] walk through whether you walk through
[2:04:18] back pain or whether you walk through
[2:04:19] this you're going to walk on to Glory
[2:04:21] buddy
[2:04:21] [Applause]
[2:04:26] I know some of you going through some
[2:04:27] hard things but Walk On The Best Is Yet
[2:04:31] To Come one Glimpse will be worth it all
[2:04:34] just to see
[2:04:37] him Hebrew
[2:04:39] children could you imagine the last
[2:04:44] step I mean come
[2:04:47] on I got two new fireplaces I'm a good
[2:04:49] Pyro
[2:04:53] that's
[2:04:55] fun still a little boy can't help it but
[2:04:59] I tell you what sometimes that dude gets
[2:05:01] hot that's what it's supposed to
[2:05:04] do that's good just not good for your
[2:05:10] hands but I could not
[2:05:12] imagine a whole
[2:05:14] furnace seven times hotter than they
[2:05:16] ever got
[2:05:19] it I'm on you know what church age we're

[2:05:29] bwing to that image that's not the image
[2:05:31] I see when I see this message I see
[2:05:34] Christ I see Jesus that's who I'm B to
[2:05:38] and if he said don't bow I Will Not Bow
[2:05:42] let's don't compromise on this message
[2:05:44] let's stick right to
[2:05:46] it what did he say there in verse seven
[2:05:49] pull verse seven back up huh hey there's
[2:05:51] Josh
[2:05:53] verse 7 aren't you glad it's verse 7
[2:05:57] amen I'm sorry those things mean
[2:05:59] something to me only be thou strong and
[2:06:01] very courageous th thou
[2:06:04] mayest mayest observe to do according to
[2:06:07] all the
[2:06:07] [Music]
[2:06:09] law which Moses my servant
[2:06:15] commanded has there not been another
[2:06:17] prophet in this day and end times SS of
[2:06:19] God that's brought forth the word of God
[2:06:21] and it's not for us to fight
[2:06:24] with that's right but it's to walk in
[2:06:28] all I'm gonna take five more minutes
[2:06:29] come on here comes the
[2:06:31] closing I don't know what it is but here
[2:06:33] we
[2:06:35] go it's cuz he's in
[2:06:39] control he's in
[2:06:42] control say so God stay with this
[2:06:46] message I don't care what anybody says
[2:06:50] you stay right with this message and
[2:06:54] don't just quote it from your mouth let
[2:06:56] your life bring action behind it and you
[2:06:59] watch God come and meet you in every
[2:07:01] trial and every fire and every problem
[2:07:04] he'll be right there with
[2:07:13] you all right two more points I'm going
[2:07:15] to
[2:07:16] close why does it have to be so hard
[2:07:18] sometimes with
[2:07:19] Matt all right nobody's asked that
[2:07:21] question
[2:07:25] question we're going Pop Quiz you again
[2:07:27] come on
[2:07:28] now why does it have to be so hard cuz
[2:07:31] you're not leaving here with your bank
[2:07:35] account you're not leaving here with
[2:07:37] your
[2:07:37] cards you're not leaving here with your
[2:07:42] problems come
[2:07:43] on but you're leaving here with
[2:07:47] character and character is a victory
[2:07:50] that sometimes you got to walk when you
[2:07:53] don't think you can walk that's right
[2:07:54] it's funny how William would close with
[2:07:58] Peter and Jesus walking on the
[2:08:02] water because God will ask you sometimes
[2:08:05] to walk in places that according to your
[2:08:07] carnal mind it looks absolutely
[2:08:12] impossible but you know what he's
[2:08:14] telling you right
[2:08:15] now
[2:08:18] come
[2:08:20] come come amen take another step
[2:08:23] Hallelujah will you trust me show me
[2:08:26] you'll trust me step out of the boat
[2:08:29] step into places you never thought you
[2:08:30] could step
[2:08:32] before step into the third pole come on
[2:08:35] somebody all he needs is a voice that'll
[2:08:37] yield thems and walk right into the
[2:08:39] third pole being made manifest in your
[2:08:43] home it won't be a public show but when
[2:08:47] the bride has need of
[2:08:48] it she'll speak that's right and there's
[2:08:51] a
[2:08:53] king brother Andrew's been preaching
[2:08:55] about it there's a king's Ministry
[2:08:57] that'll step right into a bride's
[2:08:58] Ministry and the manifestation of Jesus
[2:09:02] Christ let me read this quote as we
[2:09:04] close man I got to catch one more thing
[2:09:06] before I
[2:09:09] close it said as you
[2:09:11] walk make sure you keep the word in your
[2:09:15] mouth I'm
[2:09:18] Healed I'm
[2:09:19] saved I am filled with the Holy Ghost
[2:09:23] I'm an overcomer I love that song I'm an
[2:09:26] overcomer I've been bought with a price
[2:09:29] I am the one he went to die for I Am
[2:09:32] Redeemed Malachi 4 was sent for me SS of
[2:09:34] God there is power in your word so when
[2:09:37] you don't think you can walk begin to
[2:09:39] confess the word of God he said by my by
[2:09:42] my stripes ye are healed amen by my
[2:09:44] stripes you are healed The Works that I
[2:09:47] do ye shall do also Father I need you
[2:09:52] and you'll walk right into the
[2:09:55] manifestation of the word of God you
[2:09:59] love
[2:10:03] him some people some people can't walk
[2:10:06] unless they know the end of it amen
[2:10:09] listen I'm glad I'm not that person cuz
[2:10:10] I never been here I'd have been back in
[2:10:13] Indiana for three years figuring how I
[2:10:15] was all going to
[2:10:16] work some people are just all right
[2:10:19] let's go
[2:10:21] believe that's what the bride is cuz
[2:10:23] they're lambs and they're willing to
[2:10:26] follow brother BR would encounter
[2:10:28] somebody like that and he had a lantern
[2:10:30] in his
[2:10:32] hand he had a lantern in his hand
[2:10:35] brother B began to ask him he said
[2:10:36] where's your home it was dark out two
[2:10:39] miles that
[2:10:41] way imagine walking with a lantern for
[2:10:43] two two
[2:10:45] miles I like cars I don't know about
[2:10:49] you but he couldn't see very far the
[2:10:51] another where the landing would go but
[2:10:54] when he took another step he got a
[2:10:56] little more understanding of where he
[2:10:57] was
[2:10:59] at you may not understand where you're
[2:11:01] at but if you take another step God will
[2:11:03] show you more and more and more that you
[2:11:07] don't have to figure out the end from
[2:11:08] beginning you know if I've got the light
[2:11:10] and I'm walking in the light then I'll
[2:11:12] fellowship with the light and the Lord
[2:11:13] will take me
[2:11:15] on read this right here he says and you
