you're welcome here we love you with all of our hearts and we thank you and we so thank you guys for being here with us in the house of the Lord wasn't last night awesome Hallelujah wasn't that awesome I tell you if brother Horman was standing near the balcony and got to watch because we know they get to watch and so I'd say he was pretty proud he probably did a little dancing himself over there amen him and brother Bill and my dad and all of their family going I'd say they really enjoyed last night's service service and you know this church was built on on worship and it's always been that way when it started out in a basement then up the other building then down at the house and now here it's always been a house of worship and I I I just want to reiterate to you maybe you're new here but we don't want this house to be a house of Thieves this is a house of worship and our Lighthouse goes out from it and uh when Jesus even rebuked them because it was supposed to be a house of praise and worship ship there and Jesus knitted a he knitted a a whip together and he whipped them and they whipped them because they wouldn't worship he whipped them because they were selling and doing all different kinds of things and he just turned over the money changers you know he you know he showed himself out just a little bit and so amen that's what I want this place to do I want it to be a worship and you know we all worship different some of you very quiet some of you are dancers some of your clappers some of you're dancing all over the place and shouting some just rais their hands some just clap their hands and and you know no matter what it is I want to say thank you I remember as a little boy beating on the back of a of a chair that's what made me a drummer and you know no matter what it is I I I I I just love worship it's not going to a man it's going to God and so there's many expressions of worship and you know I remember I remember my mother she had went to a special meeting and and she was a dancer listen if there was ever an angel on the earth my mother was an angel and she was a cheerleader when she was a young girl she was a beautiful girl and I'm not saying that because I'm Prejudice I'm just telling you that's a truth and so she was a beautiful lady inside and out and she rejoiced in the Lord she loved to have a good shout now and then and and so one night she was at a big Medan and hundreds of people were there and she got she got happy and she be to dance and one of the deacons set her down it really offended her you know she wasn't doing anything out of place but it really offended her and I said mom don't you worry about it I always settled her down now don't you worry about that they don't really believe the message they don't really believe the message and it wasn't no time they had turned into a place that didn't want brother brandom's message anymore now that building is in the hands of some denominational charismatic group and the Pastors in a little bitty building well when you turn against the message I remember a man came here and you know we was worshiping and we were we were dancing and and he told me he said he we we went out to eat and he said now I don't like that I don't I don't don't like that I don't believe that's of God I sat there a moment and I knew that wasn't the right spirit and after a moment brother Homer was with me and I said after a moment I said oh now I I see why you don't like that you got a pornographic Spirit on you you you were sitting there and I said it was last Tuesday about 4:00 in the evening your wife walked in and you barely got the computer off cuz he was watching pornography that's why you don't like that now let me let me just caution you here and those that are on the internet that may not like our worship don't you disrespect that now you may not you may not do it like everybody else but I want to tell you don't you disrespect that cuz you're not disrespecting just the people you're disrespecting the angels that are here with us and you say well brother Ron I don't like that here well don't let that door hit you that's if you need an interpretation for that see me later might offend somebody cuz in this place this place is a place of worship I want to thank you brother Michael I want to thank thank you because you're a worship Warrior and I believe that God has pleased in that I want to thank you Andrew and Matthew and the worship leaders here I want to thank you I want to thank you as a people that you have discovered your freedom and your Liberty and you say well brother Ron I I don't understand that if you only knew where some of these people came from come on if you only knew where some of these people come from you could understand their worship and their praise you could understand it that's right I've watched these guys stand as they play the music and you can feel the anointing I want to thank you amen I want to thank you and we're not a bunch of Church of Christ or Baptist we're Believers we're message Believers amen I love you with all of our heart and I hope that didn't offend you and for real Believers that don't defend you and so God is worthy of our praise God is worthy and we're not here to worship a man we're not here to worship a musician we're here to worship God greet your neighbor there and say we're here to worship God amen amen amen I'm glad to be in church this morning aren't you amen if you would turn with me to Psalms chapter 24 this morning Psalms chapter 24 this morning I want to speak to you you today next weekend maybe the next weekend after the that I want to speak to you on every knee shall bow that's right amen and I want to say it not just to you but I want to say it to the whole world every knee shall bow Psalms chapter 24 and verse 1 the Earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof of the world and they that dwell therein for he hath founded upon the Seas and established it upon the floods and who shall Ascend into the hill of the North or who shall stand in his holy place he that hath Clean Hands and a pure heart who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity nor sworn deceitfully he shall receive the blessings from the Lord and the righteousness from God of his salvation this is the generation of them that seek him that seek thy face oh Jacob Salah lift up your heads oh ye gates and lift and ye lift up and ye Everlasting doors and the king of glory shall come in who is this king of glory the lord strong and mighty the Lord Mighty in battle lift up your heads oh ye gates and even lift them up and ye Everlasting doors and the king of glory shall come in who is this king of glory the lord of hosts he is the king of glory can we read that last verse together who is the king of glory the lord of host he is the king of glory you may be seated today God bless you God bless you for being here John chap 14 and verse 6 Jesus saith unto him now let's read it together I am the way the truth and the life and no man cometh unto the father but by me I want you to just notice this is very well written he is not one of the ways this is not an option here Jesus is saying it because it was the truth I am the way the truth and the life and no man cometh unto the father but by me he would be crucified for this statement but it's still the truth are you with me it is not an option he is the only way that's right he is the truth he is the life I want you to understand he is God are you with me now now Matthew chap 1 and verse 21 and and she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name for he shall save his people from their sins that was his introduction to Earth by an Angel of the Lord Philippians chapter 2 and verse 1 if there be any consolation in Christ any comfort in love if any Fellowship of the spirit if any bows and mercies fulfill ye my joy that ye may be likeminded having the same love being of one Accord and with one mind let nothing be done through Strife or vain Glory but in loneliness in mind and let each esteem the other other better than themselves look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others notice these words let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of man and being in the form of the fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the Cross wherefore God ha also highly exalted him and give him a name which is above every name that at the name of Jesus that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in Earth and things under the Earth and every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father Colossians 1 verse 15 who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in Earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers all things all things were created by Him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist for he is the head of the body the church who was the beginning the firstborn among the dead that in all things he might have preeminence for it pleased the father that in him should all fullness dwell and having made peace through the blood of his cross and by him reconcile all things unto himself by him I say whether they be things in Earth or things in heaven brother brandham says it like this he said how many sees him standing the mighty conqueror the word made flesh unveil before us I love it don't you unveil before us the Alpha and the GA he that was which is and shall come the root of the ospring of David was the son of man the Son of God the son of man and will be the son of David isn't it wonderful now I want to just remind you that you're part of him you're his very Offspring we would call you the Bride of Jesus Christ we would call you the Queen of Heaven not this is not just a temporary thing this is not just something that we're sitting here together and we're rejoicing about we are exercising in his Dominion Satan thinks that he's a king of this world but we're in this world but we're not of this world our citizenship is from another realm we are here expressed in the image of our Lord Jesus Christ and this is only temporary but we're going to rule and reign with

baseball star there's not a president that's done anything I can say but I want to say this to you Jesus has paid the price for me when I was unlovable he made me lovable when I couldn't hold myself he came and became the keeper of the gates of my [Music] life we live in a world today that kingdoms are set up and I want to make a declaration if this goes out goes out to someone might listen to it I want you to understand Putin the pope ye from China South Korea North Korea Biden amen your leaders of your nation but you won't hold that position long Satan who will be the leader in the tribulation period and rule this world Amen that incarnate serpent will anoint that man of sin we know that's the pope and he will look so innocent for quite a while but the anointing will come on him and we bring this world under his subjection but I want to say this to that King he won't hold it long he won't hold it long cuz we're going to come back with him and we're going to rule and reain

him and putting him first in everything in your life our lord I want you to just think about how powerful our God is when he said let there believe be and he believed his own word he created the entire universe brother BR said he spoke the son into existence and then from the Sun clinkers fell off of that and became stars and he would allow it to fall so far and he would stop it allow them to fall so far he would stop it he was writing his first Bible well brother Ron there's no God look up just look up if you can't see the first Bible look at the pyramid that's the second Bible right are you with me we are privileged tonight the Catholics tried to hold hold of this and it would not be left for nothing but the priests but thank God for men like like Martin Luther that saw that the just shall live by faith and W Cliffe and all the writers of this Bible they got it into the hands of a Believer this Bible is God's word to you quote it live it speak [Applause] it now let me just come a step forward this Bible that lays before you it his word it's the thoughts of God laying in word form but I want you to look over at your neighbor they are the very manifested thoughts of God before the foundation of the world you were pre-planned you were predestinated God knew where you would be and what you would live he knew some of you'd be blond-headed blackheaded redheaded he knew how tall you'd be how short you'd be he knew how skinny you would be he knew how fluffy you would be he knew the colors of your eyes he knew your nature he knew your com your complexes that you would have to deal with but God wanted your Tabernacle to be a place to where he could live in and it's in that Tabernacle right here that he wants to live on the throne room of your heart he wants that Tabernacle to be a house of worship a house of Praise we love this building we love we love the vision of this building we we like how it's built but let me just say this to you we want God to be here but I want God to be here not just here on Sunday morning but I want it to live on Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday quote it with me Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday and Sunday I'm not teaching kindergarten I want you to know God is the god of Monday he's the god of Tuesday he's the god of Wednesday God wants to live inside of you you're a carpenter God wants to do carpentry work with you if you're a lawyer he wants to do lawyer work with you if you're a doctor he wants to do law if your mama taking care of babies he's helping [Applause] you sometimes our babies can be squallers yeah sometimes they can be noisy sometimes they can be busy busy busy busy they got more energy than you ever thought that you would have in your life from room to room to place to place you can clean your house up in five minutes they can destroy it but remember this for this you [Applause] prayed I want to quote it again for this you prayed but remember this God has the same [Music] issue and you can make a mess in five minutes and you can make a mess in five minutes and God has to come down and clean you up [Applause] Matthew chapter 28 and verse 19 go ye therefore and teach All Nations and baptizing them in the name of the father and the son of the Holy Ghost in the name for unto us a child is born unto us is given and the government shall be upon his shoulders and his name shall be called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace all of those things are titles but his name encapsulated in all of the titles is Jesus Christ the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace every bit of that is in the name of Jesus when you say Jesus he is wonderful when you say Jesus he is the counselor when you say Jesus he is the Mighty God when you say Everlasting father that name is Jesus when you say Prince of Peace So when you say Matthew 28 and 19 go you therefore and teach All Nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son all of that is the name of Jesus Christ Give the Lord a great big hand right [Applause] there John 20 and verse 31 but these are written that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ the son of God and that by believing you might have life through his name I want you to read that with me but these are written that you might believe that Jesus is the Christ the son of the Living God and that by believing you might have life through his name there is no other name of God has been so full of God's glory as the name of Jesus amen thus revealing his nature to humanity although he expressed himself in elai in MDC in Elohim Jehovah of the of the in the Old Testament Jesus is the highest revelation of God Jesus literally means Jehovah Savor and it is a fullness of the revelation of God and that name encompasses all the former Revelations of God he is MDC he is the priest and King he is elsh he is Jehovah Gyra my provider he is Jehovah Nissi my banner he is Jehovah rapi my healer everything is encapsulated in that one name Jesus the there is no greater name revelation of God then in Jesus from him comes all other revelation is Jesus Is God incarnate Hallelujah then Jesus is the greatest name that there's ever been revealed can we believe that tonight and say a great big healthy amen Matthew 1 reveals this and she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name Jesus for he shall save his people people from their sins he is Anointed above his fellows every one of the prophets all the way down through the ages of the Old Testament had an attribute of Jesus inside of them you could see part God and part Moses part God and part Joseph part God and part Abraham all the way down but Jesus was the fullness of the godhead bodily he is the only one that we can worship properly we can lift up the name of Moses but he ain't Our God we can even lift up the name of brother Brandon but he ain't Our God he was born in sinful flesh just like all the rest of us but he pointed us to Jesus Christ we might even have Brother brandom's picture in this building don't let that offend you but hanging above his head is the pillar of fire that is the important one in the [Applause] picture we as a body of Believers even sitting here are anointed from the throne of God in Revelations 10 we're anointed and we are under the influence of the mighty Angel himself Christ we're anointed we're Anointed with an eagle prophetic anointing we are a special class of people I want to say this you you couldn't make yourself that God made you that I want to tell you tonight that our King is Coming oh yeah don't listen he's going to be absolutely right on time there's a war going on overseas and they're fighting over the holies of holies our King is coming they're getting ready to have two prophets hit the ground and they're going to express God for three and A2 years but before they can get get there you and I have got to leave I want to say this again our King is Coming he's not just coming to our church but every Church of this message around the world little or big Hallelujah I'm just glad to be a part of it I'm glad to be a part of it I have many incredible friends that are in the ministry and the body of Christ but I don't worship a one of them if one of them would fall tomorrow it will not affect my belief in this message none whatsoever my eyes are not on my eyes is not on flesh or even on you my eyes is on Jesus [Applause] that person fell that person quit church that P person walked away I'm sorry for them God's still rich in Mercy there's still hope for them but I want to say my eyes is not if I come next weekend and there's not a soul of you setting here first of all I think I missed the Rapture but but the Rapture can't happen without me that's what you need to say go ahead and say it right now the Rapture can't happen without [Applause] me how many know without a shadow of doubt that you got the Holy Ghost living inside of you want to ask this again how many know without a shadow of a doubt that the Holy Ghost is living inside of you all right I want to say this you that's God and God's not looking at you he's looking at at that seed he's looking at that life and if you don't have the Holy Ghost for sure in your life I want you to know this is altar is always available for you you need it for the Rapture now I want you to understand tonight in the church age book it's written Jesus Christ is God I want you to quote that with me Jesus Christ is God the Jehovah of the Old Testament is the Jesus of the new can you say that with me the Jehovah of the Old Testament is the Jesus of the new am the revelation of Jesus Christ blessed is a revelation of God that will give you authority over the devil the revelation of of Jesus Christ will give you authority over the devil the revelation of Jesus Christ I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end which is and which was and which is to come the almighty this is deity this is s not simply a prophet a man this is God and it is not a revelation of three Gods but one God the almighty on the earth he was a prophet in heaven he is a priest and he is coming back to the Earth and he is King of Kings he that was that is Jesus the prophet he that is that is he the high priest make an intercession one who can be touched with the feelings of our infirmity which is to come that is our King how it must aggravate the devil give me a hard time all week and I come up here and give him a hard time that which is that which was and that which is is to come he is Alpha and Omega which meaning that he is the A to Z ain't that good that make you ought to smile he's all I need he's everything I need he didn't leave nothing out for you Connie he's got it all taken care [Applause] up Hallelujah he is the almighty he is a Rose of Sharon he is a lily of the valley he is the bright and Morning Star he is my righteous Branch he is the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost he is God Almighty and God is one God Amen Isaiah 53 and verse three he is despised and rejected of man A Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as where our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken and smitten of God and Afflicted read this with me but he was wounded for our transgression he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are [Applause] healed I was thinking about it this week as a sermon was coming together brother Ray I was thinking about it this prophecy is written on paper 800 years before his arrival and Jesus would read this and now he's here to die and he's thinking about I am going to be beat for all those in the past and I'm going to be beat for all those in the future and I'm going to die for all those s Adam and I'm going to die for all of those even to the very last one now listen some of you were dirty rotten stinkers you might as well amen cuz you know that was a fact some of you had a big history book of what stinkers that you really were yet God didn't say I'm not going to die for him I'm not going to take that stripe for Ron Spencer I'm not going to I'm not going to die for that angry bunch of people even those rotten Palestinians that's done all that they've done and even the Jews that ha him even today he died for every one of them listen we can't see what God sees they were putting him on the cross they were hanging him in a such a brutal form and even at that point he said father forgive them for they know not what they do and if you got Jesus on the inside of you there will come forth even things that you can't think father forgive them don't look at the little 10 minute two hour or 10 year Grieves that you got don't look at your life like your life is different than somebody else's you don't know what I've been through brother Ronnie if you get Jesus on the inside of you God will take the scars of your life and make them go away at this point you can't rewrite your memory book cuz that's going to be there for the devil to war with but if you can look at the big picture I never get up and get mad at God why did cancer have to hit me I've been a gospel preacher all these years I've seen people raised from the dead I've seen cancers come off

whether I go the way you you know and Thomas saith unto him Lord we know not whether thou goest and how we know the way now read this with me and Jesus saith unto him I am the way the truth the life and no man cometh to the father but by me Matthew 28 and: 18 we're coming close to an in and Jesus came and spake unto them all power is given unto me in heaven and in Earth go ye therefore and teach All Nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost acts chap 2 and verse 2 5 for David speaketh concerning him I forsaw the lord always before my face for he is on my right hand that I should not be moved therefore did my heart rejoice and my tongue was glad moreover also my flesh shall Rest In Hope because thou will not suffer my Holy One thou will not leave my soul in Hell neither will thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption for thou Hast made known to me the ways of life and thou shalt make me full of joy and with thy countenance men and Brethren let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David that he is both dead and buried and his supper is with us unto this day therefore being a prophet and knowing that God had sworn an oath to him that the fruit of his loins according to the flesh he would raise up Christ to set on his throne he seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ that his soul was not left in Hell neither his flesh did see corruption Psalms chap 22 he seeing this before he spake of the resurrection of so of Christ that his soul was not left in Hell neither his flesh did seek corruption this Jesus this Jesus hath God raised up wherefore we all are witnesses therefore being by the right hand of God exalted and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost he has shed forth this which ye now see and hear for David is not ascended into Heavens but he saith himself the Lord s of my lord said unto my Lord sit thou on my right hand until I make the foes of th thy foot stol I like those words until I make thy foes thy foottoo so the enemy that is tormenting you let's read his future Satan you're coming to an end you're come un to an end well let's just predict this just a little bit

a Rapture so let's just say all right we could leave today amen so Satan better better really hope that we stay around a while he better really hope that we stay around a while cuz it's going to shorten his end over brother R don't you read the out at the end of the at the end of the Millennium he raises back up again deceives the world and yeah but he's getting close to his end there he don't have a good future but I want to tell you this you're as close to hell as you'll ever be you're as close to hell as you'll ever be Heaven is our future so we never never die brother Bill didn't
