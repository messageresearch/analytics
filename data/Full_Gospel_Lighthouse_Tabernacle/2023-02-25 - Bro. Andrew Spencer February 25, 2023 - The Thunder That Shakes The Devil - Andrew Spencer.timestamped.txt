[22:04] the Lord for saving my soul for heaven
[22:07] mercy on me I'm a sinner saved by grace
[22:10] and that's all I am
[22:12] I thank God for calling me his child and
[22:16] calling me to be in his bride and for
[22:19] the mercy that he's had on me he called
[22:21] me to be in his bride way back in 1977
[22:24] with my husband and our children and
[22:27] then I fell away for about 20 years
[22:29] and then he brought me back
[22:32] and I thank God for
[22:35] his ever-loving Mercy he is there's
[22:40] nothing like him
[22:41] and uh
[22:43] there are people that sin every day this
[22:46] world is full of death and destruction
[22:49] and people that don't know the way and
[22:53] if they would just fall on their knees
[22:55] as the Lord forgot us
[22:58] and look to his word
[23:00] they could find the way
[23:01] and this song is about a man who didn't
[23:04] do it in time
[23:09] a king Made A Feast for a banquet
[23:12] invited all his men to come and play
[23:16] but he didn't know before the night was
[23:19] over that the kingdom that he held would
[23:22] pass away as the crowd began to Roar in
[23:26] the drunken Slumber a word looked soon
[23:30] took his smile away as he looked he said
[23:34] behold I see a finger and it's writing
[23:38] something on the wall today
[23:41] the handwritings on the wall can't you
[23:45] see it
[23:47] the message tells the story again today
[23:51] don't be waiting a balance and found
[23:55] wanting

[24:01] I'd send you warning and now I'm sending
[24:05] judgment
[24:07] on a nation that's forgotten how to pray
[24:12] and there's no way you can erase it
[24:17] the handwritings on the wall again today
[24:22] now this world is getting closer to
[24:25] destruction

[24:52] away

[25:26] sent you warning and now I'm sending

[43:51] amen God sees every hand just now
[43:56] Heavenly Father we come before you
[43:58] tonight Lord Jesus and we lay aside all
[44:02] of our nervousness Lord and Lord all of
[44:06] our anxieties the Lord Jesus of this
[44:09] chaotic world that we live in father
[44:12] the Lord we're very aware Lord that we
[44:15] are living in an age that is full of
[44:16] neurotics father
[44:18] but Lord I believe that there's real
[44:20] peace in your presence so hard and
[44:23] Lord that's why we sing from all of our
[44:26] heart Lord we want you to stay
[44:29] and Lord it's it's not a presence that
[44:31] comes and goes
[44:33] but Lord we we recognize father there
[44:37] are things in this world that can scare
[44:39] or push away your presence and our
[44:42] Prophet would tell us that it's kind of
[44:44] like the Holy Spirit like a dove he goes
[44:46] and flies on a limb and
[44:50] he just invite the dove of the Holy
[44:52] Spirit to come fly over our hearts Lord
[44:55] just now Lord and
[44:57] or do you just draw us closer to you
[45:00] Lord by your by Your Word it's just how
[45:03] you do father
[45:05] Lord any man can open up the pages of
[45:07] the Bible but when you begin to take a
[45:10] letter after letter Lord and begin to
[45:12] address Us in this
[45:14] sweating gown father
[45:17] or do we recognize that you're the one
[45:19] that is
[45:20] has made the dress father for us so
[45:24] so we could be a fitting to the image
[45:26] that you took of us before the
[45:27] foundation of the world
[45:29] Lord everything within us cries out we
[45:32] want to match the image father
[45:34] Lord we're a piece of the master
[45:37] and Lord Jesus we recognize that man
[45:39] couldn't put what they marred back into
[45:42] place
[45:44] but because of Calvary you took us and
[45:46] you placed us and restored us into our
[45:48] rightful position and Lord I pray
[45:51] tonight that that under the sound of my
[45:54] voice father that you administer to your
[45:57] children Lord we've gathered in your
[45:59] name we've come to glorify it father and
[46:02] we're asking Lord that you would touch
[46:03] your children's Heart Lord we know that
[46:06] you're very near and we ask God that you
[46:09] touch every hand that's been lifted up
[46:11] by the need that is upon their heart
[46:13] Lord we'll be careful to serve you and
[46:15] praise you and oh Lord I Thank you for
[46:18] being here for us tonight in Jesus name
[46:20] amen amen if you ever Bibles this
[46:23] evening would like to look over and two
[46:26] portions of scripture
[46:27] in the New Testament there in the book
[46:30] of Hebrews chapter 12.
[46:32] and verse 22 and then also down to
[46:35] Revelations
[46:36] Revelations chapter 1 and verse 10.
[47:01] Hebrews chapter 12 and verse 22.
[47:13] I know we got technology that we can
[47:16] read our Bible from but it's nothing
[47:18] like reading it hearing the pages of the
[47:20] Bible begin to open up it's just I
[47:23] believe those
[47:24] I believe the devil just
[47:26] just begins to fly off when he knows
[47:29] that his children are getting ready to
[47:30] read the word of God
[47:32] ma'am Hebrews chapter 12 and verse 22
[47:35] but you are come unto Mount Zion unto
[47:38] the city of the Living God the heavenly
[47:39] Jerusalem and to an innumerable company
[47:42] of angels
[47:44] the general assembly and Church of the
[47:46] firstborn which are written in heaven
[47:49] and to God the judge of all and to the
[47:51] spirits of just men made perfect
[47:54] and the Jesus the mediator of the
[47:56] Covenant
[47:58] and to the blood of a sprinkling that
[48:00] speaketh better things than that of Abel
[48:03] see that you refuse not him that
[48:05] speaketh
[48:06] for if they escape not who refused him
[48:08] that spake on Earth much more shall not
[48:11] we escape if we turn not away from him
[48:14] that speaketh from heaven
[48:16] whose voice then shook the Earth but now
[48:18] he hath promised saying yet once more I
[48:20] shake not the Earth only but also the
[48:23] heavens and this word yet once more
[48:25] signified
[48:27] the removing of those things that are
[48:29] shaken as of things that are made that
[48:32] those things which cannot be shaken May
[48:34] remain wherefore we receiving a kingdom
[48:37] which cannot be moved let us have Grace
[48:41] whereby we may serve God acceptably with
[48:44] reverence and godly fear for our God is
[48:48] a consuming fire Revelations chapter 1
[48:52] and verse 10
[48:54] if you're not aware where that's at it's
[48:57] at the back of the Bible
[49:02] Revelations chapter 1 verse 10.
[49:07] and I was in the spirit on the Lord's
[49:11] Day
[49:13] and heard behind me a great voice as of
[49:16] a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega
[49:21] the first and the last what thou seeest
[49:24] is right in a book and send it unto the
[49:27] seven churches which are in Asia under
[49:29] Ephesus under smyrnia and pergamus
[49:32] thotara under Sardis under Philadelphia
[49:34] and under lay artisan
[49:37] notice and I turned to see the voice
[49:39] that spake with me and being turned I
[49:41] saw seven golden candlesticks now pay
[49:44] attention listen real closely and in the
[49:47] midst of the seven golden or seven
[49:49] candlesticks one likened to the son of
[49:51] man clothed with a garment down to the
[49:54] foot and gird about the paps with a
[49:57] golden girdle now you're looking at him
[49:58] face to face right here now watch his
[50:01] personages his head and his hairs were
[50:04] white like wool as white as snow in his
[50:06] eyes were like as a flame of fire and
[50:10] his feet under the fine brass as if they
[50:12] had burned in a furnace and his voice as
[50:15] the sound of many Waters and he had in
[50:18] his right hand Seven Stars and out of
[50:21] his mouth when a sharp to its sword and
[50:23] his countenance was as the sun shineth
[50:25] in his strength
[50:27] and when I saw him I fell at his feet as
[50:29] dead and he laid his right hand upon me
[50:33] saying unto me fear not I am the first
[50:36] and the last I am he that liveth and was
[50:39] dead and behold I Am Alive forevermore
[50:42] amen and have the keys of hell and of
[50:46] death may God bless his word you may be
[50:49] seated in the presence of the Lord
[50:52] I'd like to to read this this portion of
[50:55] a quote here and the brothers sisters
[50:58] have it there for you tonight and I'd
[50:59] like for this to be where we draw our
[51:02] context tonight
[51:04] he said now everybody can't be a
[51:06] preacher he said but you got a voice and
[51:09] if you can't preach the people a sermon
[51:10] if you're if you're a preacher you're
[51:12] called to the pulpit to preach he said
[51:15] if you're not you're still a preacher
[51:16] but live the people a sermon let your
[51:21] sermon be lived and it's the voice of
[51:23] God that'll bring the reproach to them
[51:25] whose that will bring the reproach to
[51:28] them who reject it they say no one can
[51:31] put a finger on his or her life there
[51:34] their their sweet living they if if
[51:37] there was ever a man of God it's that
[51:39] man or that woman see live your sermons
[51:43] don't try to preach them if you're not
[51:45] called to be a preacher you're you'll
[51:47] get it all mixed up anyhow messed up and
[51:49] you'll get people tangled up and you
[51:52] don't you won't know well you'll ruin
[51:54] them and yourself too just live your
[51:56] sermon the preachers called to preach is
[51:58] and to live it too and and if you can't
[52:01] live it then you stop preaching it but
[52:02] you're supposed to live your sermons all
[52:05] right here was voices Oh how we need in
[52:09] Jeffersonville thousands of lived voices
[52:12] the Thunder of God thundering out in
[52:14] sweetness and in Holiness Purity
[52:16] undefiled lives walking around in the
[52:19] Earth today without a blemish yes sir
[52:21] real Christians and that's what we want
[52:23] to be real Christians real Christians
[52:28] that's the Thunder against the enemy the
[52:31] devil don't care how loud you can holler
[52:33] the devil don't care how much you can
[52:35] jump or how much you can do this or that
[52:38] or or shout but What Hurts The Devil is
[52:41] to see that Sanctified holy life
[52:43] consecrated to God say anything to him
[52:46] call him anything just as sweet as it
[52:49] can be and move right on oh my that
[52:51] throws him away that's the Thunder that
[52:54] shakes the devil just like well you say
[52:56] well if he could preach like Billy
[52:58] Graham or Oral Roberts a great
[53:00] influential speaker oh oh no sometimes
[53:02] the devil just laughs at that he don't
[53:04] pay no more attention to that than
[53:06] nothing he said you get all of that
[53:08] theology you wanted to and all the
[53:10] Seminary training and the devil just sit
[53:12] back and laugh at it but when he sees
[53:14] that life
[53:16] but when he sees that life you see
[53:19] tonight I'd like to speak to you from
[53:20] this thought tonight on the Thunder that
[53:23] shakes the devil the Thunder that shakes
[53:25] the devil you see the devil doesn't care
[53:27] how much you holler
[53:30] the devil doesn't it doesn't care how
[53:33] loud you scream it doesn't matter how
[53:34] loud you shout but what hurts the devil
[53:37] and I think it's something that I
[53:39] absolutely love as a Christian doing is
[53:41] hurting the devil but What Hurts The
[53:43] Devil is to see that real Sanctified
[53:45] holy consecrated life to almighty God
[53:48] and to think that tonight but that that
[53:50] you could have all of his Theology and
[53:52] all the intellects of the world and all
[53:54] the Seminary training but What Hurts The
[53:57] Devil is to see that real Sanctified
[54:00] holy life and remember when Jesus is
[54:03] there with his disciples and that man
[54:05] brought his son that was a lunatic to
[54:07] him I referred to that to you just a few
[54:09] weeks ago but you remember the disciples
[54:12] stood there and that man the little boy
[54:13] had the spirit of epilepsy that was upon
[54:16] him that often comes cast him into the
[54:18] fire but you remember when those
[54:20] disciples when they stood there because
[54:22] of their lack of faith they cannot make
[54:24] that enemy move you see the enemy you
[54:26] can't Bluff the enemy the enemy knows if
[54:29] you've got the goods or not you see you
[54:31] don't have to tell the devil how big you
[54:33] are the devil recognizes a life on the
[54:35] inside of you and you can profess to be
[54:38] a Christian but the devil knows whether
[54:40] you're really living and out or whether
[54:41] you're just making an open confession
[54:43] before men or or others but you see the
[54:46] devil stayed right there upon that
[54:48] epileptic child and Jesus Jesus rebuked
[54:51] them because of their little faith but
[54:53] when the devil that was on the inside or
[54:55] was upon that little child that
[54:56] epileptic devil when he turned around
[54:58] and he seen Jesus he seen something
[55:01] different on the inside of him that he
[55:03] didn't see in the disciples as of that
[55:06] time because they had not been to an
[55:08] upper room yet but you see that devil
[55:10] turned around and he got good and scared
[55:12] right there when he looked over there
[55:14] and he seen that life that was on the
[55:16] inside of that body and let me I'm going
[55:18] to borrow a statement from from Brother
[55:20] Wayne Lawson that devil looked on the
[55:22] inside looked at Jesus and he said how
[55:25] in the world did that man get on the
[55:27] inside of there how did that life get on
[55:30] the inside of that vessel and to think
[55:32] that tonight that sitting here tonight
[55:34] in Earthen vessels tonight that you have
[55:37] this treasure on the inside of Earth and
[55:39] vessels and it's a power under the Holy
[55:42] Ghost it is the life of the word that
[55:45] scares the devil off of what is
[55:47] rightfully yours so they will steer the
[55:49] squatter off of your life you see what
[55:51] it is it's the life that scares the
[55:54] devil it isn't how loud you pump the
[55:56] music up it isn't how loud you scream
[55:59] that scares the devil it is the real
[56:01] Sanctified Holy Ghost life now I can
[56:05] hear every little every little critic
[56:06] already hollering well if that's all it
[56:08] is then why do you do all of that
[56:10] hollering you see there's a life on the
[56:12] inside of us that causes a burden of the
[56:15] word on the inside of our life and I
[56:18] believe that if we can live this message
[56:20] then we ought to be able to shout this
[56:22] message if we can really preach this
[56:24] message and and be a real light in this
[56:26] generation then we ought to be as
[56:28] excited about Jesus Christ as to the
[56:30] world is excited about ball games and
[56:33] everything else out there if we can live
[56:35] this message through its Truity and live
[56:38] it in his Purity then we ought to stand
[56:40] toe-to-toe with the Devil by the life of
[56:42] the word
[56:43] I don't think it's something some people
[56:45] say well well we ought to just we ought
[56:47] to quit our jumping and we ought to quit
[56:49] our shouting because we can't live no
[56:51] higher than this I'll say if you'd start
[56:53] living higher you can be able to start
[56:55] jumping higher if you can start living
[56:57] at a higher level of life and a higher
[56:59] level of faith you'll be able to move
[57:01] into the heavenlies
[57:03] what is it it is the life of the word
[57:06] that has caused a quickening power to
[57:08] come upon our life and quickened us and
[57:11] made us a life you see what Jesus is he
[57:15] is the life Giver to the seed word that
[57:18] he deposited and when you have been
[57:20] birthed by the Holy Ghost by the genuine
[57:22] Holy Spirit it brings the life to the
[57:26] word that he deposited you see in a few
[57:29] silence my life you're silencing my
[57:32] voice and if you can silence the life of
[57:34] Jesus Christ you will silence the voice
[57:37] of the Bride in this hour if you're
[57:39] silencing Jesus then you're silencing us
[57:46] is that right if you silence our life
[57:49] and you're silencing our voices you'll
[57:52] notice that that what did covet try to
[57:54] do he tried to shut us up I know I'm not
[57:56] going to spend too much time on that and
[57:58] I don't care whether you did or whether
[57:59] you didn't but I want you to know that
[58:01] what covet tried to do he tried to shut
[58:04] the very mouth of the people of God up
[58:06] but it's something about the children of
[58:08] God is is they don't take too lightly to
[58:10] shutting up their mouths because we know
[58:13] that if we can put this word upon our
[58:15] lips tonight and really live it not just
[58:18] speak it into the atmosphere as some
[58:20] mental Christian today but really live
[58:22] out what you're praying and really live
[58:24] out what you're saying that the enemy
[58:27] will Run for Cover
[58:29] all right is that right now notice what
[58:31] the Bible said in Revelations 4 and 5
[58:33] that out of the throne preceded
[58:36] Lightnings and thunderings and voices
[58:37] and there were seven lamps of fire
[58:39] burning Before the Throne which are the
[58:41] seven spirits of God what is that it is
[58:44] God speaking to the church he's
[58:46] reflecting himself through those seven
[58:48] spirits and when the true anointed of
[58:51] God speaks it is the voice of God can
[58:53] you say Amen when the true anointed of
[58:55] God speaks it is the voice of God and to
[58:59] reject it is to remove the Candlestick
[59:01] now you cannot remove us from the
[59:04] seventh Church age because if you remove
[59:06] us from the seven Church age you are not
[59:09] just removing us you're removing the
[59:11] voice out of that seventh Church age but
[59:13] we are here right now
[59:16] and there is an anointing here to speak
[59:18] the same things that Paul spoke and it's
[59:22] by a restored word but we recognize that
[59:26] Thunder when you see thunder in the
[59:28] Bible that Thunder is the very voice of
[59:31] God you remember when Jesus goes up
[59:33] there and those Greeks come and they
[59:35] said they wanted to see Jesus but they
[59:37] couldn't see him because of the veil
[59:39] that Jesus prayed a prayer and he in
[59:41] John chapter 12 and 28 he said father
[59:44] glorify thy name and a voice came from
[59:48] heaven and it said I have already
[59:50] glorified it but I will glorify thy name
[59:53] again and there were those that were
[59:56] standing around and said well it
[59:57] thundered and others said that an angel
[1:00:00] spake but what is it it was the voice of
[1:00:03] God and Jesus answered them and said the
[1:00:06] voice didn't come for my sake but the
[1:00:08] voice came for your sake to think that
[1:00:11] today that you're living in the days of
[1:00:14] the voice of the seventh angel the
[1:00:16] Angel's voice that came in this
[1:00:17] generation came for your sake
[1:00:20] and Lord still has a voice in this
[1:00:23] generation and I'm going to blow some of
[1:00:25] your minds right now but your voice is
[1:00:28] his voice
[1:00:30] your voice is his voice if you want to
[1:00:33] accept it or whether you don't I'm
[1:00:35] quoting to you William Branham he said
[1:00:37] your voice is his voice that's why that
[1:00:41] Satan wants to shut you up put you in a
[1:00:43] corner because he knows that if the same
[1:00:46] spirit that was back there in the early
[1:00:48] Apostles took that word and manifested
[1:00:51] the same life that was on our Lord Jesus
[1:00:53] Christ if you take it it'll manifest the
[1:00:56] same exact thing in this generation you
[1:00:59] see because deity is not just in heaven
[1:01:02] but deity is on the inside of a bride of
[1:01:05] Jesus Christ and Jesus said that heaven
[1:01:07] and earth will pass away Matthew 24 and
[1:01:09] 35 Heaven and Earth will pass away but
[1:01:12] my voice will never pass away is that
[1:01:15] right his word is his voice because in
[1:01:18] the beginning what's the word and the
[1:01:20] Word was with God and the word was
[1:01:23] you see when God begins to speak he
[1:01:26] gives strength when he speaks it's
[1:01:28] forever settled in heaven you see
[1:01:30] there's a lot of people that can run off
[1:01:32] at the mouth but when God speaks he's
[1:01:34] not just blabbering off things but when
[1:01:36] God says something he means it
[1:01:39] if God says he loves you
[1:01:43] if God says he's for you if God says
[1:01:46] he's your healer if God says he should
[1:01:48] deliver if God said he's your way maker
[1:01:51] if God said he'd be your provider
[1:01:53] it's forever settled in heaven you see
[1:01:57] when he speaks all hell moves
[1:02:00] nothing can stand in his presence
[1:02:04] you know brother random was one time he
[1:02:06] was preaching there in my commission and
[1:02:08] he was standing there he said you see he
[1:02:11] said he said I am just your brother by
[1:02:13] the grace of God he said but when the
[1:02:15] angel of the Lord moved down he said it
[1:02:18] becomes then a voice of God to you
[1:02:20] he said if I offended you by saying that
[1:02:22] forgive me but I felt that might been
[1:02:25] resented now not watch this here's the
[1:02:28] man trying to ask he felt the way he
[1:02:31] felt that it was resented he said if I
[1:02:33] offended you forgive me but watch what
[1:02:35] the voice of the Lord did he said but I
[1:02:38] am God's voice to you see I say that
[1:02:41] again that time was under inspiration he
[1:02:43] said I felt bad about the first time but
[1:02:45] it repeated it you see there is
[1:02:48] something that is in control of the age
[1:02:51] of that we are living in
[1:02:55] and we are under the greatest message
[1:02:58] that the world has ever seen do you
[1:03:00] recognize that this message that went
[1:03:02] around the world over seven times but it
[1:03:05] was not the man William Brandon's voice
[1:03:07] that caused the attraction to the Lord
[1:03:10] Jesus Christ it was the voice behind the
[1:03:13] voice you see because Elijah went up
[1:03:16] there in that cave you remember he went
[1:03:18] up there in that cave and he was he
[1:03:19] thought he was the only one that was
[1:03:21] serving God in his own in his own stead
[1:03:23] he thought he was the only one up there
[1:03:25] but you remember how the Lord came by
[1:03:27] there and fire and wind and an
[1:03:29] earthquake but none of them had grabbed
[1:03:31] his attention but when God spoke to him
[1:03:33] through a still Small Voice he
[1:03:36] recognized the presence of the Lord and
[1:03:39] the reason why you are here tonight it's
[1:03:42] not because I called you it's not
[1:03:44] because a man called you it's because
[1:03:46] the voice of almighty God Came Calling
[1:03:49] by your way and when you God when God
[1:03:51] called you if you were his
[1:03:55] if you were his you could not stay in
[1:03:57] the pig pen that you are in and in that
[1:03:59] condition but there was an angel that
[1:04:01] stood in this generation night after
[1:04:03] night that stood there you've seen it
[1:04:05] before service tonight but you watched
[1:04:07] he was an angel he was an Angelic being
[1:04:10] that would stand there time and time
[1:04:12] again that would point out and say now I
[1:04:15] see this or I see that what was it it
[1:04:17] was the operation of the Holy Ghost
[1:04:21] he said it's not my voice it's his voice
[1:04:26] Hallelujah you see what it is I am God's
[1:04:30] voice to you what is this in this
[1:04:33] generation
[1:04:35] you are God's voice whether the world
[1:04:38] wants to receive you or not whether the
[1:04:40] world wants to cast you down or not you
[1:04:42] are God's voice
[1:04:44] why don't you just say it with a little
[1:04:45] bit of prefervency and a little bit of
[1:04:47] zeal in this generation right now
[1:04:49] speaking into the atmosphere I am the
[1:04:53] voice of almighty God God has got to
[1:04:55] have hands to work through God's got to
[1:04:57] have a mouth to work through God's got
[1:05:00] to have a body to work through I am
[1:05:04] his voice
[1:05:07] I know it's taken some of you just for a
[1:05:10] little bit but just for a little bit but
[1:05:12] you that know the message know that I'm
[1:05:14] telling you the truth if you know your
[1:05:16] Bible you know I'm telling you the truth
[1:05:17] what was it that David did when he stood
[1:05:20] out there and he turned down all of
[1:05:22] Saul's ecclesiastical verse he was
[1:05:25] turning down the intellectual voices
[1:05:27] that were trying to tell him that he had
[1:05:30] to go that way but David took the voice
[1:05:33] he took the voice of a conqueror that
[1:05:37] had defeated a lion and had defeated a
[1:05:39] bear and he took the voice of the inside
[1:05:41] and he went out there and he grabbed
[1:05:44] those five smooth stones
[1:05:47] and he defeated Goliath what was it it
[1:05:50] was one voice and I'll say this to you
[1:05:53] tonight there was one William Branham
[1:05:55] but he screamed back on top the hill
[1:05:57] said boys this is for Divine Healing he
[1:06:02] took that voice and went out there and
[1:06:04] all of Israel got behind David's voice
[1:06:09] oh what are you doing in this generation
[1:06:11] we're behind our great warrior David
[1:06:13] we're behind the Lord Jesus Christ we
[1:06:16] are his voices
[1:06:18] and if God's wanted to sound out a
[1:06:21] message he's got to have a body that he
[1:06:23] can speak through
[1:06:29] the Bible says in Ezekiel chapter 10
[1:06:32] verse 4 that then the glory of the Lord
[1:06:36] went up from the Cherub and stood over
[1:06:39] over the threshold of the house and the
[1:06:42] house was filled with a cloud and the
[1:06:44] court was full of the brightness of the
[1:06:46] Lord's Glory
[1:06:47] and the sound of cherubims wings Was
[1:06:50] Heard even to the outer courts as the
[1:06:53] voice of the almighty God when he speaks
[1:06:56] now think about this that the glory of
[1:06:59] the Lord it began to remove back and the
[1:07:02] angels and the angels went back and when
[1:07:05] their wings begin to flock together when
[1:07:08] they begin to Wings when they begin to
[1:07:10] Flap together and they were hanging over
[1:07:13] the very threshold of the house of the
[1:07:15] Lord
[1:07:17] that the glory of the Lord filled all
[1:07:20] the house and the angels Wings when they
[1:07:23] moved with a sound it was the sound of
[1:07:26] el shadiah it was the voice it was as
[1:07:30] the voice of almighty God when the
[1:07:33] Angels begin to beat their wings it was
[1:07:36] as the very voice of el shadiah
[1:07:40] now I know you don't see him tonight but
[1:07:42] there are angels that are all around
[1:07:44] this room tonight they are gathered here
[1:07:46] to make sure that you're okay they're
[1:07:49] gathered here to protect you they're
[1:07:51] gathered here to watch you worship
[1:07:52] because nobody can worship like the
[1:07:55] redeemed of the Lord can worship but
[1:07:57] when they if if those angels can and
[1:08:00] they move in such power that their wings
[1:08:02] begin to they make a sound it's like the
[1:08:06] very voice of el Shady eyes speaking now
[1:08:09] I don't have to tell you what else Shady
[1:08:11] eye is he is the almighty God he is the
[1:08:14] breasted one and I'll say this that out
[1:08:17] of el shadia Abraham got a new body
[1:08:21] there's an angel in this generation and
[1:08:24] out of this generation there's been an
[1:08:25] angel a covenant angel that has stood
[1:08:28] here
[1:08:30] and this bride is taking the voice of
[1:08:33] their Shady eye
[1:08:34] she's putting on the new garment she's
[1:08:37] getting ready for rapturing faith
[1:08:40] you see those angels you may see them
[1:08:43] and you may feel them as you begin to
[1:08:45] worship you're bumping into angels all
[1:08:48] the time you are bumping into a
[1:08:50] supernatural world
[1:08:53] now if angels can move their wings and
[1:08:56] it's like the sound of el shadiah how
[1:08:59] much more when the Sons and Daughters of
[1:09:01] God begin to move into the rhythm of the
[1:09:05] sympathy and they begin to scream out
[1:09:07] Shalom it is the changing of the beat
[1:09:10] again and it's a sympathy getting in
[1:09:12] order
[1:09:16] and brother random told us he said now
[1:09:18] you go looking at the Old Testament in
[1:09:20] Psalms 34 and 7 he said those angels
[1:09:23] that the angel of the Lord encampeth
[1:09:25] about them that fear Him Now notice
[1:09:27] those angels are not leaving you those
[1:09:30] angels are having a camping party around
[1:09:32] you
[1:09:33] those angels are making sure they're not
[1:09:36] going to sleep when you go to sleep
[1:09:37] they're watching you
[1:09:40] we always used to sing that little song
[1:09:42] we as children angels watching over me
[1:09:44] but do you recognize that you can't do
[1:09:46] anything without the angel of the Lord
[1:09:48] watching over you
[1:09:53] Hallelujah do you recognize that the
[1:09:56] voice of el Shady high is covering you
[1:09:58] in this generation If Abraham can nurse
[1:10:02] on El Shady eye and he could pull out
[1:10:04] himself a new body
[1:10:07] went out to Church of the Living God be
[1:10:09] able to do be able to nurse off the Old
[1:10:12] Testament and New Testament
[1:10:15] you're not in as bad as cases Abraham
[1:10:17] was Abraham was a hundred years old
[1:10:20] Abraham didn't have he didn't have any
[1:10:22] sign of it coming In the Flesh
[1:10:25] but you've got it coming In the Flesh
[1:10:27] you feel it working in your spirit
[1:10:30] but he just leaned over on the breast of
[1:10:32] el shadiah and he pulled out
[1:10:36] what'd he do what did he do the same one
[1:10:39] that had talked to him all of his life
[1:10:41] had led him to this moment and he didn't
[1:10:43] call him Abram he called him Abraham
[1:10:48] ain't Angel stood in this generation
[1:10:49] said I'm not going to call you Church
[1:10:52] I'm going to call you bride so that you
[1:10:55] understand what I'm talking about
[1:10:57] the reason why you're here is because
[1:11:00] you recognize the very voice of the Lord
[1:11:04] and just like John he recognized that
[1:11:07] voice and when he turned to see he
[1:11:10] didn't turn he didn't turn to hear the
[1:11:13] voice he turned to see The Voice
[1:11:16] because the person and the voice are one
[1:11:20] and the same
[1:11:21] you see and John recognized his voice
[1:11:24] and every son and daughter of God that
[1:11:27] are here tonight or throughout the Bride
[1:11:29] of Jesus Christ you are here and he
[1:11:32] calls to you and you recognized him
[1:11:36] well it was Peter out there doing when
[1:11:38] he was fishing he recognized that was
[1:11:40] his Lord out there
[1:11:42] when he told him cast his net on the
[1:11:43] other side he recognized it was the Lord
[1:11:46] out there when the two disciples that
[1:11:48] had walked with him all day long when
[1:11:50] they watched him in his actions what was
[1:11:52] it they were watching the voice that had
[1:11:54] spoke to them now create exactly
[1:11:58] exactly what they were thinking in what
[1:12:00] they were hoping he would be
[1:12:04] you see if you can ever really get to
[1:12:06] seeing the word you'll begin to get to
[1:12:09] see Jesus
[1:12:11] if you can get to where you really see
[1:12:13] the word that in the beginning was the
[1:12:15] word and the Word was with God and the
[1:12:16] Word was God and if you can really get
[1:12:18] to seeing the word you'll begin to see
[1:12:20] Jesus
[1:12:22] you're not seeing a man here tonight I
[1:12:25] didn't gather you here it was not my
[1:12:28] emotions it was not my Charisma that
[1:12:30] gathered you here it was the voice of
[1:12:33] another world that called you here
[1:12:36] is that right I'm gonna lay some words
[1:12:39] for you tonight and just as Moses was
[1:12:42] talking to a burning bush and the voice
[1:12:44] talked out of that burning bush I'll say
[1:12:46] the same one is as close to you right
[1:12:49] now
[1:12:50] as he was standing there with Moses at
[1:12:53] that burning bush
[1:12:55] he's walking the aisle tonight and he's
[1:12:57] beginning to open up your hearts and
[1:13:00] he's as close to you right now picture
[1:13:02] it in your mind Moses talking to a
[1:13:04] burning bush but picture it right now
[1:13:06] our Lord Jesus Christ having a
[1:13:09] conversation with you
[1:13:14] now don't get mistaked by the veil don't
[1:13:17] get your eyes on the veil you look at
[1:13:19] who's talking to you you see because if
[1:13:21] it's God's voice it'll line up with the
[1:13:24] word but you watch John recognized it
[1:13:27] was that same voice that was talking to
[1:13:30] him it was the same one that done those
[1:13:32] all of those actions
[1:13:35] it was the same boys in the midst of the
[1:13:38] seven Church ages he wasn't on the
[1:13:40] outside of the church he was walking in
[1:13:43] the midst of the seven golden
[1:13:45] candlesticks which represent all of the
[1:13:47] church ages so it doesn't show it
[1:13:50] doesn't show he shows us that right here
[1:13:52] right now
[1:13:54] son of man is working in this place
[1:13:57] you've not built up your mind to think
[1:14:00] that it's that it's something all for
[1:14:02] something off in a distance but you
[1:14:04] recognize that the son of man is here
[1:14:06] right now he's revealing himself by the
[1:14:09] very preaching of the word and this
[1:14:12] bride's Revival that you are in
[1:14:16] it's not something that you're you're
[1:14:18] it's not something that you're just
[1:14:20] shook up about and is it something new
[1:14:22] this message turned our hearts back to
[1:14:25] the faith of the Pentecostal fathers
[1:14:31] you know you know why I'm preaching you
[1:14:33] the truth because brother random said in
[1:14:35] trying to do God a service he said hey
[1:14:37] Revival will never come until the
[1:14:39] Sovereign God sends it he said it would
[1:14:41] take some it'll take some little nitwit
[1:14:44] they can't even sign his own name and do
[1:14:46] with it that knows that it don't even
[1:14:48] know good English let alone Greek but
[1:14:51] what is it the spirit of the Lord can
[1:14:53] never send a Revival
[1:14:55] a revival can never come until the
[1:14:58] spirit of the Lord sends it it's for an
[1:15:01] appointed time and it's for an appointed
[1:15:03] season and you remember what William
[1:15:05] Branham preached to us in the third seal
[1:15:07] he said the bride's not had her Revival
[1:15:10] yet
[1:15:11] she's still waiting on this is 1963. he
[1:15:14] said the bride's not had a Revival yet
[1:15:16] he said it'll take those seven Known
[1:15:18] Unknown Thunders back there to wake her
[1:15:20] up
[1:15:22] this bride
[1:15:24] I know we're living in a generation that
[1:15:26] want to call themselves woke but we've
[1:15:28] been woke up to a long time ago when the
[1:15:30] Thunders woke us up to who we really are
[1:15:33] the rest of the world is getting woke up
[1:15:35] and thinking they're coming out of the
[1:15:36] closet but the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:15:38] knows exactly who she is
[1:15:41] that's what the Bible said in revelation
[1:15:43] 22 and 10 seal not up these prophesies
[1:15:47] still not enough still not up the
[1:15:49] sayings of this book what is it it is a
[1:15:53] restoration of the Bride tree the same
[1:15:55] one that was there the same fruit that
[1:15:58] was in the bridegroom is in the bride
[1:16:00] tree again and you could not have been
[1:16:02] here without a restoration but because
[1:16:05] he said unseal the book
[1:16:08] unseal the book that is exactly what the
[1:16:11] Seven Seals or the opening of the seals
[1:16:13] did it is the revelation of the seven
[1:16:16] Thunders and you have been woke up to
[1:16:19] the fact I am a bride I am his chosen I
[1:16:22] am elected
[1:16:24] that's what shakes the devil is because
[1:16:27] you know who you are you know who you
[1:16:29] believe it's a voice on the inside of
[1:16:32] the body
[1:16:34] you've been woke up to the fact that
[1:16:36] you've got a pedigree you've been woke
[1:16:38] up to the fact that you got an abstract
[1:16:41] title deed you've been woke up to the
[1:16:43] fact that you've got the very token life
[1:16:45] of almighty God
[1:16:47] and you can't rock me back to sleep
[1:16:49] little devil you can't put me back to
[1:16:51] sleep you can't play enough soft moves
[1:16:54] music to shut me up
[1:16:57] Hallelujah
[1:16:59] I've been woke up to the fact that I'm
[1:17:02] the final voice in this final age and I
[1:17:05] can't go to sleep on it
[1:17:09] [Applause]
[1:17:13] that's the Thunder that shakes the Devil
[1:17:15] is a voice that lives it out a voice
[1:17:18] that believes it a voice that takes it
[1:17:29] when he and his wife get in speaking
[1:17:32] conditions again then an Eden will come
[1:17:36] foreign
[1:17:40] brand I'm standing there and he preaches
[1:17:43] to us the anointed ones at the end time
[1:17:46] and he stands there and he goes on
[1:17:49] through there and he goes and takes the
[1:17:52] opening of the seals the third pool
[1:17:54] Ministry or the face of the seventh seal
[1:17:57] he goes in there and he connects the
[1:18:00] third pull to Luke 17 30 to Malachi 4
[1:18:03] and the revelations 10 and he opens a
[1:18:07] mystery to the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:18:08] that there is Christ there's a prophet
[1:18:11] and there is a bride in this generation
[1:18:14] in all of those verses I'll just give
[1:18:16] you brother Branham pointed us in our
[1:18:19] anointed ones at the end time
[1:18:21] that the third poll is connected to the
[1:18:24] bride's Ministry so you see it's no
[1:18:27] longer the king's sword is no longer in
[1:18:30] the mighty Angel's hand
[1:18:32] he's the one to give it but it's not in
[1:18:35] the mighty Angel's hand it's not in the
[1:18:37] prophet's hand but this this sword of
[1:18:40] the Lord is in the hand of the Bride
[1:18:43] you have the saith the Lord you will
[1:18:46] shut down hell
[1:18:49] Hallelujah that's the Thunder why don't
[1:18:52] you start speaking out
[1:18:55] what do you have in your hand Moses
[1:18:59] if Moses could stretch her Rod out
[1:19:01] brother joy and it could open up rich
[1:19:04] sea and you walk over on dry ground and
[1:19:07] have one of the greatest phenomenals
[1:19:09] I say it'll be this bright that takes
[1:19:12] this third pool Ministry and opens up
[1:19:14] all the laodicea and we walk out of this
[1:19:17] chaos
[1:19:18] well I don't know about you I'm ready
[1:19:20] why don't we take an Enoch stroll real
[1:19:23] quick
[1:19:31] you couldn't put nothing on Enoch's life
[1:19:33] and everybody could criticize him
[1:19:35] everybody could say all kinds of needs
[1:19:37] about him but he had a virtuous life he
[1:19:40] was so pleasing to God that God was so
[1:19:43] pleased with his life that one of those
[1:19:45] days he just took him
[1:19:47] why don't we just have a walk with
[1:19:50] Higher King theophany
[1:19:53] oh
[1:20:02] and notice what the Bible said
[1:20:05] in Zechariah 4 and I'm not going to read
[1:20:07] it to you but I I you can go back and
[1:20:09] read it a little bit later but I want to
[1:20:11] I want to gather this song just for a
[1:20:12] minute because Zechariah say it in verse
[1:20:15] verse 1 of chapter four he said in the
[1:20:18] angel that talk of me came again and
[1:20:21] wake me as a man that had waken me out
[1:20:24] of his sleep that awakened out of his
[1:20:26] sleep you go and read that that there
[1:20:29] Zechariah is shown he he looks all the
[1:20:33] way into the church ages he sees the
[1:20:36] same thing that John was looking at he
[1:20:39] saw the seven golden candlesticks he saw
[1:20:42] the two olive trees of which those lamps
[1:20:45] were gathering their oil out of both old
[1:20:48] and both New Testament and you recognize
[1:20:51] and you know good and well that the oil
[1:20:54] represents the Holy Ghost
[1:20:58] you see and all of those lamps they were
[1:21:01] lit off of the original fire that came
[1:21:04] off of the altar what was it it was that
[1:21:07] fire that God sent down out of Heaven
[1:21:09] that was ordained to go to the church
[1:21:12] ages and so the priests would go over
[1:21:15] and he would take the fire off of The
[1:21:17] Altar and he'd come over and he would
[1:21:19] light the first one that was on top of
[1:21:21] the bowl and it would take from that
[1:21:22] first lamp he would gather the fire from
[1:21:25] the first lamp and he would take it over
[1:21:26] to the second lap he'd take the fire
[1:21:28] from the second half onto the third onto
[1:21:31] the fourth and all the way down until
[1:21:33] all of those lamps were burning what was
[1:21:36] it they were burning with the same fire
[1:21:38] that came from the original altar what
[1:21:41] are you burning with you are burning
[1:21:43] with the same holy ghost that fell on
[1:21:46] the day of Pentecost the same holy ghost
[1:21:48] that Paul had you have
[1:21:53] what is it it's an oil it's an oil and
[1:21:56] it's a never-ending oil it can't run out
[1:21:59] he's the all-sufficient one he is your
[1:22:02] satisfying portion Abraham
[1:22:05] everywhere else couldn't satisfy Abraham
[1:22:08] but El shadiah was his satisfying
[1:22:11] portion I've had the world but give me
[1:22:13] Jesus I've had the World by itself but
[1:22:16] give me Jesus he is my satisfying
[1:22:19] portion drugs couldn't keep me alcohol
[1:22:22] couldn't steal me the Devil Couldn't
[1:22:24] kill me because God is my satisfying
[1:22:28] portion
[1:22:35] Hallelujah
[1:22:37] Hallelujah
[1:22:39] it's the same fire
[1:22:43] that's what shakes the devil
[1:22:46] it's the same life
[1:22:49] it can be more I know there's a whole
[1:22:51] lot of professors and there's a whole
[1:22:53] lot of confessors but you can watch them
[1:22:55] professors in their confessions your
[1:22:58] watch ain't nothing but a bunch of
[1:22:59] Spectators that have set on the sideline
[1:23:01] and when you're facing the real devil
[1:23:03] they'll Run for Cover and they'll be
[1:23:05] nothing what by what they're good for
[1:23:06] nothing but a bunch of good benchwarming
[1:23:08] people that'll never stand there and
[1:23:10] take your back they'll back off when
[1:23:13] you're really facing a devil
[1:23:15] you watch a good spectator
[1:23:17] announce one of the generals that he's
[1:23:20] got cancer in his body you watching you
[1:23:22] watch those little you watch those
[1:23:24] little Devils they'll begin to run
[1:23:26] forgive me if I've offended you but I'm
[1:23:29] not here to be a spectator and I'm not
[1:23:31] here to take a side with somebody
[1:23:32] that'll back off and give off I'm here
[1:23:36] to be with somebody that's not afraid to
[1:23:38] shake the kingdom of hell
[1:23:41] laughs
[1:23:43] what is it God ain't looking for some
[1:23:46] intellectual Giant
[1:23:53] he said you know he said what the
[1:23:55] problem is with the world he said they
[1:23:56] want their intellectual preachers he
[1:23:58] said they want one of them Whispering
[1:24:00] Whispering preachers one of them
[1:24:02] Whispering pastors he said but what God
[1:24:05] wants is thunderbolts
[1:24:07] he wants somebody that recognized the
[1:24:10] voice of God if Moses Moses was back
[1:24:14] there
[1:24:15] on the backside of a dancer but one time
[1:24:18] in the presence of the Lord and he went
[1:24:20] down there to Egypt and he took over
[1:24:22] what was it it was a son of man making
[1:24:24] Invasion down there into Egypt
[1:24:28] I'm trying to bottle up the preacher
[1:24:31] just for a moment
[1:24:32] but God didn't want some sissified soul
[1:24:36] that can stand back here and says take
[1:24:38] my intellectual armor put it on it'll do
[1:24:41] you good but there's a bride like little
[1:24:43] David said I never proved that before
[1:24:45] but I have proved this word it's killed
[1:24:48] lines it's killed Giants it's killed
[1:24:50] bears
[1:24:52] I can take Hebrews 13 8 and I can tell
[1:24:55] you it works I can take Isaiah 53 and I
[1:24:58] can tell you that it works
[1:25:01] somebody's going to put this word on
[1:25:03] their lips
[1:25:04] because they know that they were dealing
[1:25:06] with a closed book they're dealing with
[1:25:08] an open book They're Not Afraid of the
[1:25:10] restoration of the gifts back into the
[1:25:12] body they're not afraid because you have
[1:25:14] been given a restoration
[1:25:19] all right
[1:25:21] so right I'm telling you the truth
[1:25:22] you're not under you're not under some
[1:25:25] gospel that ain't been restored you're
[1:25:27] under you are under the ministry of
[1:25:29] Malachi 4 where your hearts have been
[1:25:31] turned back to the faith of Paul and the
[1:25:34] apostolic fathers now notice notice what
[1:25:38] it did it was in three days that God
[1:25:41] restored and he showed that he was alive
[1:25:43] again on the first day in Luther's day
[1:25:47] there was no life there in Wesley's day
[1:25:49] there was no life there and on the third
[1:25:52] day it was a rumor that he was up but on
[1:25:54] but at the end at the evening time they
[1:25:58] recognize that the same one that they'd
[1:26:01] walk with on the shores of Galilee was
[1:26:03] showing himself openly before the
[1:26:06] generation what is this generation sin
[1:26:09] it's the restoration of the broad tree
[1:26:16] Hallelujah
[1:26:21] brother Andrew what about all these
[1:26:23] other churches
[1:26:26] they say they're the Church of God they
[1:26:29] say they're the Church of Christ that's
[1:26:31] a name that they tacked on there
[1:26:34] God didn't attack that name on there
[1:26:36] he only put his name in one place
[1:26:40] and there's good people in them churches
[1:26:44] some of the finest people you ever meet
[1:26:45] down there in them churches
[1:26:48] but remember it was this church age
[1:26:51] that spew that kicked Jesus out
[1:26:54] put him on the outside what was it they
[1:26:57] didn't want the life of it
[1:27:00] you remember America turned her back on
[1:27:02] this message
[1:27:04] they put him on the outside they didn't
[1:27:06] want him in the schools they didn't want
[1:27:08] him in the house they didn't want him in
[1:27:09] their churches they definitely don't
[1:27:11] want him behind the pulpit
[1:27:13] but you watch they can stand there and
[1:27:15] they'll go on professing that they are
[1:27:18] the mouthpiece of God but notice God
[1:27:21] says she's not my mouthpiece
[1:27:24] she she'll go on professing and saying
[1:27:27] that she is the voice to the world but
[1:27:29] it's very contrary to the very word of
[1:27:32] God
[1:27:35] come on somebody
[1:27:36] now I know that it looks close but
[1:27:39] remember
[1:27:40] the seed is not air with the shuck
[1:27:43] it's not it you see what happened
[1:27:45] Pentecost had to push you out Pentecost
[1:27:48] had to separate so that you could show
[1:27:50] what was really on the inside the same
[1:27:53] seed that went down into the ground it's
[1:27:55] the same one that's resurrected again
[1:27:58] what is God coming back for the same
[1:28:01] life he said I am Alpha and I am Omega
[1:28:04] what you saw in the first stage was the
[1:28:07] alpha bride what you're seeing in the
[1:28:09] Southern church age is the Omega bride
[1:28:11] she's born of his bone life of his life
[1:28:13] power is power same anointing same work
[1:28:16] same actions
[1:28:18] Satan can't stand the thought that you
[1:28:21] are going to be the same Jesus
[1:28:24] he lost at the cross he lost at the
[1:28:27] grave he lost with the weather that had
[1:28:29] a dead baby and he still losing he lost
[1:28:32] in Mexico he lost in Memphis he lost in
[1:28:36] Tennessee he lost in Elkton he will lose
[1:28:39] the battle because we are not born of
[1:28:41] this world we are born of another world
[1:28:43] [Applause]
[1:28:46] Satan I got bad news for you you're
[1:28:49] gonna keep on losing and we're gonna
[1:28:51] keep on winning we've been burst from
[1:28:54] above it's your kingdom not just in word
[1:28:57] but since it's a kingdom in power
[1:29:05] God has a voice
[1:29:07] and his voice is in his wife
[1:29:13] now your brothers know
[1:29:15] you either have a real marriage
[1:29:19] I make you testify you
[1:29:21] don't be too scared if you got a real
[1:29:22] marriage
[1:29:31] anyway
[1:29:34] your brothers know you've got a real
[1:29:36] marriage there ain't nobody you trust
[1:29:38] more than your wife
[1:29:41] trust her with your secrets
[1:29:44] you trust her with your bank account you
[1:29:46] trust her with your life you trust her
[1:29:48] with everything now who could God trust
[1:29:51] with
[1:29:52] with all of his power and all of his
[1:29:55] authority what is he going to have to do
[1:29:57] he's going to have to give her the same
[1:29:59] mind that was in him it's going to have
[1:30:02] to be in the bride because William
[1:30:04] Branham said she knows what he once done
[1:30:07] with the word now how could you know
[1:30:09] what he once done with the word unless
[1:30:11] you had his mind
[1:30:12] how could you know that he's still marks
[1:30:15] 16 in action how can you still know that
[1:30:18] there's still gifts in the body how can
[1:30:20] you still know that there's healing and
[1:30:22] there's powers in The Miracle what is it
[1:30:24] it's the dynamite on the inside of your
[1:30:27] mind that says Jesus is still Jesus

[1:32:00] golf clap about what he's preaching
[1:32:02] about and before along your old
[1:32:04] Methodist foot is stomping around think
[1:32:06] of my goodness I'm acting like a bunch
[1:32:08] of rest of him

[1:32:34] are going to walk out on the ashes we're
[1:32:37] going to walk out we're going to rise
[1:32:39] above it all because we are elected to
[1:32:41] overthrow every devil in hell
[1:32:45] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:32:55] the Thunder that shakes the devil
[1:32:58] live voices

[1:33:22] he's not scared of a seminary voice
[1:33:25] but what shakes The Devil Is that real
[1:33:29] Sanctified live voice
[1:33:33] live it out

[1:33:44] one Accord you ain't got to figure it
[1:33:45] out in one day you ain't got to figure
[1:33:47] it out the Bible said I believe in the
[1:33:49] book of Deuteronomy he said I give you
[1:33:50] the land little by little that it won't
[1:33:52] overtake you but I will be an adversary
[1:33:55] to your adversaries and when the enemy
[1:33:57] Rises against you I will rise
[1:34:00] I will rise and you are going to destroy
[1:34:04] the kings of the earth go study it out I
[1:34:07] believe it's Deuteronomy 7. I think
[1:34:08] that's right I'll give it to you after
[1:34:09] church if you don't believe me but I'm
[1:34:11] telling you the truth he said he said
[1:34:13] and you will destroy the names of their
[1:34:16] kings so let me tell you the king of sin
[1:34:19] the king of worry the king of doubt the
[1:34:22] king of depression you've got to destroy
[1:34:24] him little by little you can do this

[1:34:30] Survivor you're gonna do it live it out
[1:34:35] live it out
[1:34:38] [Applause]
[1:34:42] it's a real voice
[1:34:44] there's power behind his voice
[1:34:46] because he spoke
[1:34:48] and there was
[1:34:50] he said let there be
[1:34:52] and they're once
[1:34:54] so the same one has got to be speaking
[1:34:57] through you brother Chris
[1:35:00] but you've got to break the carnality
[1:35:02] out of your life
[1:35:08] I know it's going to get sticky but I
[1:35:10] promise you it it'll get better
[1:35:12] but you've got to break the voice of
[1:35:15] reason
[1:35:16] you've got to break the voice of
[1:35:18] carnality
[1:35:21] well we've did our new service
[1:35:23] we've sang a few songs
[1:35:25] the preacher read some scriptures he
[1:35:27] made a funny comment he looked a little
[1:35:29] funny he did his he did his part
[1:35:33] let's sing a song at the end let's be
[1:35:35] dismissed
[1:35:37] the days
[1:35:38] of watering the not watering the seed
[1:35:41] are over
[1:35:45] too many times
[1:35:46] churches around the message have set and
[1:35:49] barely watered the seed
[1:35:54] they set back and they only pour a
[1:35:57] little bit of water on it let me tell
[1:35:58] you when it's in the driest of Seasons
[1:36:01] you brothers that are gardeners you make
[1:36:03] sure to put the water on the seed
[1:36:04] because you want it to come up but the
[1:36:07] days of only barely watering the seed
[1:36:10] are over
[1:36:11] this is the hour that we take our
[1:36:14] worship to another level
[1:36:17] we don't worship from this ground we
[1:36:20] worship From Below above
[1:36:24] come on
[1:36:28] I'm happy with one Sean we'll get out of

[1:36:45] your rose burn your chicken burn your
[1:36:48] hide I don't care we have come to the
[1:36:51] king of kings and we are going to
[1:36:53] worship Him
[1:36:59] don't like long Services you just never
[1:37:02] should have said under Paul because Paul
[1:37:04] preached all night long and a guy fell
[1:37:07] over and he died you thought he got the
[1:37:09] point but he went back there and
[1:37:11] resurrected him and he went back to
[1:37:13] preaching
[1:37:14] [Applause]
[1:37:16] come on now
[1:37:18] come on now I ain't held you all night I
[1:37:21] ain't held you all week long get with me

[1:37:32] over your ideas why don't you shake the
[1:37:34] devil out of your life and try to say
[1:37:36] well just impress me just excite me
[1:37:41] [Applause]
[1:37:44] I got the same problem that I had two
[1:37:46] weeks ago I tried what you said and I
[1:37:48] gave up that's the reason you still got
[1:37:51] the same problem
[1:37:53] but if you really live it out you're
[1:37:55] living like job lifted it didn't matter
[1:37:57] what everybody else saw it didn't matter
[1:37:59] what everybody else seen you could put
[1:38:02] Joan in a belly's well you could put
[1:38:04] Daniel in the Lion's Den but it was
[1:38:06] still and overcomer
[1:38:11] you love me
[1:38:13] you love me
[1:38:18] yeah
[1:38:19] I won't shut up and I won't sit down
[1:38:22] because I'm not the one that brought
[1:38:24] this message to this town the Holy Ghost
[1:38:27] has brought this message by your way and
[1:38:30] we will not back off on the seven seven
[1:38:32] seals mystery we won't back up the
[1:38:34] fivefold ministry we will stand here and
[1:38:37] preach to you a live voice we will
[1:38:39] preach to you that you can win you can
[1:38:41] overcome
[1:38:54] foreign
[1:38:55] to me for Moses
[1:39:00] why grind me
[1:39:02] speak
[1:39:06] we're living in a very second time
[1:39:10] look at the earthquake
[1:39:12] look at the ring of fire around the
[1:39:13] world
[1:39:17] it won't be long
[1:39:19] it won't be long but you watch worlds
[1:39:22] are shaking
[1:39:23] Financial statuses are shaking politics
[1:39:26] are shaking but you've received a
[1:39:28] kingdom that cannot be shook
[1:39:31] come on somebody the rest of the world's
[1:39:33] shaking the rest of the world's nervous
[1:39:35] but you have received a kingdom that
[1:39:38] cannot be shook because you receive the
[1:39:40] kingdom of God and God cannot shake
[1:39:43] himself
[1:39:45] God ain't getting Shook Up in Heaven say
[1:39:47] well hell my goodness I didn't see that
[1:39:48] one coming God ain't shook up and so
[1:39:51] should you not be shook off you received
[1:39:53] a kingdom by the baptism of the Holy
[1:39:56] Ghost a kingdom of God that cannot
[1:39:59] shaken
[1:40:03] but this voice
[1:40:05] shakes the very Kingdom of hell
[1:40:09] what is the kingdom of Satan brother
[1:40:11] Andrew it's anything that's contrary to
[1:40:13] the word of God
[1:40:18] he's going to make you all kinds of
[1:40:20] promises
[1:40:21] but he can't give you salvation he can't
[1:40:24] give you peace he can't give you
[1:40:26] happiness what is he going to bring to
[1:40:28] you he's going to bring to you anything
[1:40:30] that's contrary to the word of God but
[1:40:32] the Bible said in Corinthians 4 and 20
[1:40:34] that the kingdom of God is not in word
[1:40:37] but it is in power
[1:40:39] is that right you see what that word is
[1:40:42] it's the word that is made flesh it's
[1:40:44] John 1 and 14. the Word was made flesh
[1:40:47] and it dwelt amongst us and the kingdom
[1:40:49] of God comes on the inside of you and
[1:40:52] when it becomes on the inside of you
[1:40:54] that he that abideth in me ask what you
[1:40:56] will and it shall be done unto you when
[1:40:59] the kingdom of God is on the inside of
[1:41:01] you what is it doing it makes itself
[1:41:04] word and it says exactly what it said
[1:41:08] David said in Psalms 1 16 and 10 he said
[1:41:11] I believe therefore I speak
[1:41:17] we've not followed Conley devised Fables
[1:41:21] We are following the voice of the
[1:41:24] almighty one
[1:41:28] all right
[1:41:30] all right
[1:41:33] hold the message up
[1:41:35] hold the message up and your watch stays
[1:41:37] open up
[1:41:41] the intelligence that brought you here
[1:41:45] set boundaries around you
[1:41:50] I'm going to say something very powerful
[1:41:52] right here
[1:41:53] that the intelligence that brought you
[1:41:55] here has set boundaries about you
[1:41:59] that Satan can only go so far
[1:42:06] if the moon sets the boundaries of the
[1:42:07] sea so does this bride have a voice to
[1:42:11] say Satan that's far enough
[1:42:13] I've had enough of you I'm sick and
[1:42:15] tired of you stealing my joy
[1:42:17] that's what this age is to restore it's
[1:42:20] to restore all that the canker worm the
[1:42:22] Palmer worm the caterpillar all of those
[1:42:25] things all in all ate off
[1:42:27] Satan that's far enough
[1:42:30] you've ate it my joy long enough
[1:42:33] you've ate at my peace long enough
[1:42:37] you've aided my happiness long enough
[1:42:41] happiness
[1:42:44] Lord
[1:42:45] is joy
[1:42:50] and the joy of the Lord is my strength
[1:42:57] what was it what was it Zachariah
[1:43:01] Zechariah when the angel of the Lord
[1:43:03] asked him said do you understand what
[1:43:04] you're looking at
[1:43:06] you understand what you're looking at
[1:43:08] and he said
[1:43:09] oh Lord
[1:43:11] he said I'm saying this
[1:43:13] he said it's not by might and it's not
[1:43:16] by power but it's by my spirits saith
[1:43:19] the Lord
[1:43:22] you don't know how many times I've set
[1:43:25] an altar
[1:43:26] spent hours
[1:43:28] with people
[1:43:30] countless
[1:43:32] saying these words I just can't live it
[1:43:40] and they gave up
[1:43:42] I just
[1:43:44] I just can't live it
[1:43:47] well I want to give you a news
[1:43:49] flash to all the world you couldn't live
[1:43:52] it either
[1:43:56] come on now
[1:43:58] you know good and well you tried and you
[1:44:01] tried and you tried and you tried but
[1:44:03] you just couldn't live it
[1:44:04] but one morning
[1:44:06] one moment one time he made the
[1:44:10] difference where you couldn't live it
[1:44:13] but now he's living it on the inside of
[1:44:15] you I'm telling you you hold on to him
[1:44:18] he'll hold on to you it ain't some
[1:44:21] Mama's religion it ain't your daddy's
[1:44:23] religion it ain't some coattail religion

[1:54:16] in this in this moment
[1:54:20] this intelligence that is in this room
[1:54:25] understands what you are going through
[1:54:38] remember when he was standing there with
[1:54:40] an infidel
[1:54:42] when he starts talking to him about an
[1:54:44] apple
[1:54:46] and he starts preaches back to him he
[1:54:48] said he said oh you preachers are a
[1:54:50] bunch of
[1:54:51] lying dogs you're barking up the wrong
[1:54:52] tree
[1:54:58] he said but there is one I'd like to see
[1:55:02] he said because there was a sister on
[1:55:05] top of hill here was dying
[1:55:09] I said I heard this awful noise that was
[1:55:11] going on and
[1:55:13] hurt his awful noises going and thought
[1:55:14] well she doesn't die we'll just wait
[1:55:15] until the morning take the wagon up
[1:55:17] there and we'll take her take her to the
[1:55:18] Undertaker
[1:55:21] so we went up there
[1:55:24] and there was a man that had prayed over
[1:55:26] a handkerchief and they laid it on this
[1:55:27] woman and she was up fixing them
[1:55:29] breakfast the next morning
[1:55:34] he said I'd like to meet him
[1:55:36] I'd like to meet that guy
[1:55:44] he said
[1:55:46] what makes this happen
[1:55:48] because they're starting to fall off
[1:55:51] he said the life's leaving the tree it's
[1:55:53] going back into the ground he said
[1:55:55] he said what's doing that and he said he
[1:55:57] said well it's it's just nature
[1:56:01] you know the story
[1:56:02] he said but
[1:56:04] he said I'll tell you he said the same
[1:56:06] intelligence
[1:56:08] the same intelligence
[1:56:11] that tells this tree to run itself all
[1:56:14] the way down in The Roots
[1:56:17] he said it is the same intelligence that
[1:56:19] told me
[1:56:20] to do that
[1:56:23] she said it's the same intelligence
[1:56:26] now there that intelligence will stand
[1:56:28] in front of that Infidel all those days
[1:56:31] that same intelligence was standing
[1:56:33] there preaching to him time and time
[1:56:35] again

[1:57:05] atmosphere
