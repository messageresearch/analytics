[0:22] setting up in colorado
[0:23] a few months ago in a a little cabin
[0:27] i once said to my son my wife my
[0:29] daughter-in-law and then
[0:32] last couple of hours something happened
[0:35] i saw a young lady a beautiful woman
[0:40] and she had kind of thick lips looked
[0:41] like i saw her somewhere
[0:44] and she's she was trying to get to a
[0:46] doctor
[0:48] and she died and the spirit that was
[0:51] speaking to me
[0:52] said now they will say
[0:57] that she committed suicide but she died
[1:01] with a heart attack
[1:02] and said it's just a little before four
[1:05] but you can say it was four o'clock and
[1:08] the vision left me
[1:10] i told him what did that mean i didn't
[1:11] know somebody's fixing to die
[1:13] when we come out of the mountains two
[1:14] days later that the
[1:16] movie star what's that woman marilyn
[1:18] monroe
[1:21] she was kind of a strip teaser you read
[1:23] her story
[1:25] she was a illegitimate child her
[1:28] mother's in the insane institution
[1:30] poor little girl probably had a hard way
[1:33] and she always hungered for something
[1:35] i wish i could have got to her i know
[1:38] what she needed
[1:40] i knew what she needed yet she joined
[1:42] churches and everything
[1:43] but see it's just a ritualistic form she
[1:46] needed the application of the blood
[1:49] see now
[1:52] i guess there isn't a sex fiend in the
[1:56] country
[1:56] but what an older had her picture she's
[1:59] supposed the most perfect built woman as
[2:01] i understood
[2:02] there was in the world but if that
[2:06] anatomy is so great then watch
[2:10] when the life went out of her body
[2:13] they had to give her a number to lay in
[2:16] a room
[2:16] and nobody would claim her body
[2:21] so which is the important part the soul
[2:24] are the body

[45:54] there winning
[45:56] i love it how the prophet said that he

[46:14] possible
[46:16] i told you last night that 2020 was a
[46:18] perfect set up for miracles
[46:20] and our theme has been that this year
[46:24] that god is with us and we will see
[46:26] miracles
[46:29] i have to say we've seen miracles
[46:32] and i i can't get that smile off my face
[46:35] because
[46:36] because we're in his presence and when
[46:38] we're in his presence there's fullness
[46:40] of joy
[46:42] i tell you when you're in his presence
[46:44] good things happen
[46:46] the bible says in psalms 145 i will
[46:49] extol thee my god
[46:50] o king i will bless thy name forever and
[46:53] ever
[46:54] every day i will bless thee and i will

[47:15] of thy majesty and of thy wondrous works
[47:19] i will be one of those that will speak
[47:22] of his wondrous works what about you
[47:24] today this morning
[47:26] will you speak of his wondrous works now
[47:29] 2020 i can't even
[47:31] just as a whole of our body collectively
[47:33] here
[47:34] there's no way physically that i'm able
[47:37] to be able to draw everything out
[47:39] but how many has been a part of a
[47:41] miracle
[47:42] this past year
[47:46] i'm going to do something that i said i
[47:48] wouldn't do but i'd like the brothers to
[47:50] turn the camera on our congregation just
[47:52] for now and you keep your hands up but
[47:54] you've been a part of a miracle
[47:56] those that are watching by the way the
[47:58] internet
[47:59] i want you to look at all of these
[48:01] miracles that have happened
[48:03] and if these miracles can happen for
[48:05] them they can happen for you
[48:09] we're in the presence of the lord where
[48:11] all things are possible
[48:14] and satan has done his absolute best to
[48:17] stop the move of god and he's done his
[48:19] worst to keep us from
[48:21] believing that all things are possible
[48:24] but i believe that there is a people
[48:26] on earth today that believe more than
[48:28] god is able but they believe that god
[48:31] will fulfill his promise and that he
[48:33] will keep his word
[48:35] and i believe that we are that people
[48:38] that
[48:38] we are the generation that will speak of
[48:41] the wondrous
[48:42] things of god and 2020 has been a
[48:45] showdown between
[48:47] satan and god and i want to tell the
[48:49] bride of jesus christ that
[48:51] god will win time and time
[48:54] and time and time and time again
[48:57] and no matter what the enemy throws on
[49:00] us we will
[49:01] always come out winning so he can throw
[49:04] sickness he can throw torment he can
[49:06] throw doubt he can throw interference
[49:08] but god's already got it all worked out
[49:11] for his good this is the year of
[49:14] miracles
[49:15] and our god is still in the miracle
[49:18] working business

[57:26] is that going to be okay the music
[57:30] is more important than the struggle

[57:37] it's more important than the struggle
[57:40] amen and that will be our title this
[57:44] morning
[57:48] i have spoken the muse i have spoken a
[57:50] sermon in
[57:52] in times past on the the hurt

[57:58] i want to look with a different emphasis
[58:00] this morning on

[58:16] isaiah chapter 55 and verse 5.
[58:39] isaiah 55 and 5.
[58:50] amen you love the lord this morning
[58:53] amen someday i'll tell you what just
[58:57] happened there
[59:02] someday
[59:08] behold thou shalt call call a nation
[59:12] that thou knowest not
[59:15] and nations that knew not
[59:19] thee shall run unto thee
[59:22] because of of the lord thy god
[59:27] for the holy one of israel for he hath
[59:30] glorified thee
[59:33] seek ye the lord while he may be found
[59:36] and
[59:37] call ye upon him while he is near
[59:42] let the wicked forsake his way and the
[59:45] unrighteous man his thoughts
[59:48] and let him return unto the lord for he
[59:52] will have mercy upon him and to
[59:56] our god for he will abundantly
[59:59] pardon for my thoughts are not
[1:00:03] your thoughts neither are
[1:00:06] your ways my way saith the lord
[1:00:11] for as the heavens are higher than the
[1:00:15] earth
[1:00:16] so are my ways higher than your ways
[1:00:21] and my thoughts than your thoughts
[1:00:24] for as the rain cometh down and the snow
[1:00:28] from heaven and returneth not
[1:00:31] thither but watereth the earth and
[1:00:35] maketh it bring forth and bud
[1:00:39] that it may give seed to the sower
[1:00:43] and bread to the eater and so
[1:00:46] shall my word be
[1:00:49] that goeth forth out of my mouth
[1:00:53] and it shall not return unto me void
[1:00:58] but it shall accomplish that
[1:01:01] which i please and it shall prosper
[1:01:06] in the thing where to
[1:01:10] i sent it amen
[1:01:13] you may be seated and may the lord bless
[1:01:17] the reading of his word
[1:01:37] god's word said is god is speaking to us
[1:01:40] in your
[1:01:41] in our humanity
[1:01:45] and he says your thoughts
[1:01:48] for my thoughts are not your thoughts
[1:01:54] neither your ways my ways
[1:02:04] sometimes we get so
[1:02:08] bottled in our human thoughts
[1:02:12] we can't see the big picture
[1:02:18] i think about a young man a young family
[1:02:20] that's sitting here just now
[1:02:24] and they're down praying about moving
[1:02:27] moving
[1:02:28] and god just directs them
[1:02:31] to come here and they don't really know
[1:02:35] who i
[1:02:35] am they don't know me
[1:02:39] they know me by distant association
[1:02:44] and god's got a plan he's got a plan
[1:02:52] and they come
[1:02:55] and we go out after service one night
[1:02:58] and we sit beside of each other and
[1:03:00] pizza
[1:03:01] have pizza together and i'm thinking
[1:03:05] these kids what are they going to move
[1:03:08] here for
[1:03:10] i drove by their house a few moments ago
[1:03:14] and i looked up and the scripture came
[1:03:17] to me
[1:03:20] in their prayer meeting in their humble
[1:03:23] little home
[1:03:24] back home there's no way that they could
[1:03:28] see where they would be today
[1:03:34] i want you to understand it there's no
[1:03:36] way you could see where you would be
[1:03:38] today
[1:03:39] in that spot but that was a
[1:03:43] moment that god began to say
[1:03:46] i've got some plans for you
[1:03:48] [Music]
[1:03:51] i got some plans for you and so here you
[1:03:55] look
[1:03:55] you look and i drove by this morning and
[1:03:58] god would speak to me
[1:03:59] as i was driving by and these thoughts
[1:04:02] were coming
[1:04:04] and and this is the evolving thought
[1:04:07] your house is being done the trees are
[1:04:10] being renovated things are
[1:04:12] happening god had a plan
[1:04:17] and he put a driving force on the inside
[1:04:20] of that
[1:04:21] sure there was struggles
[1:04:24] sure there was things that had to be
[1:04:26] moved and
[1:04:28] shaken and thoughts and opinions
[1:04:31] but it's not about the struggle
[1:04:38] brother branham and this has been on my
[1:04:41] heart for this week
[1:04:43] brother branham is singing a song in one
[1:04:46] of his last meetings
[1:04:49] and as he's singing a song and he's just
[1:04:51] coming to the end he's
[1:04:52] he's preached a service called on the
[1:04:55] wings
[1:04:56] of a snow white dove he
[1:04:59] has been asked to tame it down
[1:05:03] in the meeting he has been asked to
[1:05:07] uh kind of allow the doctrines to kind
[1:05:10] of
[1:05:10] you know be put backwards they they
[1:05:13] really didn't want to get that
[1:05:15] they didn't want the doctrines they they
[1:05:18] they they didn't want to hear invisible
[1:05:20] union of the bride and
[1:05:22] they didn't want to hear god's chosen
[1:05:24] place of worship and
[1:05:26] would you would you would you go back
[1:05:28] and preach one of those sermons a
[1:05:30] lamb in the dove maybe it was because
[1:05:34] the church was rejecting the message
[1:05:39] and so brother branham comes and he
[1:05:41] preaches on the wings of a snow white
[1:05:43] dove and he describes to
[1:05:45] us that how that dove was released in
[1:05:48] the time of war
[1:05:50] and how that they shot at it and they
[1:05:52] shot at it and maybe it was wounded a
[1:05:54] bit
[1:05:55] and and then and then he comes down to
[1:05:58] the end
[1:05:59] and he sings a song and under
[1:06:02] inspiration now
[1:06:07] he he puts a verse with it
[1:06:11] and we sing it and we kind of think that
[1:06:14] that verse went with it all the time but
[1:06:16] he's singing he's singing a song with it
[1:06:21] and we know it we know that on the wings
[1:06:23] of a snow white dove
[1:06:26] god sends his pure sweet love
[1:06:30] a sign from above
[1:06:35] on the wings of a dove
[1:06:38] though i have suffered
[1:06:43] in many a way
[1:06:48] i cried for healing
[1:06:58] both night and day
[1:07:03] faith wasn't forgotten
[1:07:07] by the father above
[1:07:16] he sent me a sign
[1:07:20] on the wings of a dove
[1:07:25] on the wings
[1:07:37] yes pure sweet love
[1:07:44] a sign from above
[1:07:51] on the wings
[1:07:54] of
[1:08:05] don't you understand
[1:08:08] that his presence is here
[1:08:12] you're in the presence of a living god
[1:08:16] not a man but a real
[1:08:19] god who didn't live only
[1:08:22] 2 000 years ago but lives tonight
[1:08:27] right here
[1:08:31] right here in this presence
[1:08:36] now
[1:08:38] i wonder sometimes when we come to
[1:08:41] church
[1:08:44] do we catch the point
[1:08:49] of all the people in the earth
[1:08:52] were gathered to this spot
[1:08:56] we're gathered to this chosen place
[1:09:00] where god wants to come and be with his
[1:09:03] people
[1:09:05] i'm reminded of just as the scriptures
[1:09:07] are in chronological order
[1:09:10] i'm reminded as brother brandon would
[1:09:13] come to meetings as a messenger of
[1:09:15] god oh he was a man but he had a message
[1:09:21] that would deliver the the people
[1:09:25] i studied all day thursday we
[1:09:29] we were on vacation this week and it's
[1:09:31] our week of vacation
[1:09:33] but i was driven thirsty on a thought
[1:09:37] and it just
[1:09:37] it just would not leave me i i just had
[1:09:40] to grab a hold of it
[1:09:44] and i had to had to had to get a hold of
[1:09:46] it for this day
[1:09:49] and the message
[1:09:53] that we have in this day
[1:09:57] will translate us and put us in a
[1:10:00] rapture
[1:10:03] are you with me that's what separates us
[1:10:07] from every every church entity
[1:10:11] and every every group of people that has
[1:10:14] a steeple
[1:10:16] or a cross or or a worship
[1:10:19] center the message that was sent
[1:10:23] it is the music that will translate our
[1:10:28] life
[1:10:30] it was the opening of the scripture of
[1:10:33] the bible
[1:10:34] and it was like it was like glasses to
[1:10:38] the bible
[1:10:40] six for for thousands of years we'd been
[1:10:43] blinded
[1:10:45] [Applause]
[1:10:47] but the message didn't bring us a new
[1:10:49] book
[1:10:50] [Applause]
[1:10:51] it only opened the book
[1:10:53] [Applause]
[1:10:55] and it allowed us to fall in love with
[1:10:58] the with the author of the book
[1:11:04] are you with me you can't separate it
[1:11:07] it allowed us to fall in love and and
[1:11:10] and the message wasn't sent for us to
[1:11:13] fall in love with brother branham though
[1:11:15] that's a good thing
[1:11:18] are you with me and and i'm not wanting
[1:11:20] you to not fall in love with him
[1:11:22] but he's not who you're marrying
[1:11:27] are you with me he's not who you're
[1:11:29] marrying you're marrying christ
[1:11:32] [Applause]
[1:11:36] are you with me and brother branham and
[1:11:39] his personal struggles
[1:11:42] and and as he would come along that way
[1:11:44] he would drop
[1:11:45] certain things about his
[1:11:48] personal complexes and his personal
[1:11:52] struggles and
[1:11:53] how he was raised as a bootlegger's son
[1:11:56] and and the difficulties of his wife
[1:11:59] dying
[1:11:59] and he and his child dying and and the
[1:12:03] difficulties of
[1:12:04] of the the men that were around him that
[1:12:07] would turn him down
[1:12:08] and take things away from him
[1:12:11] and he just loved him anyway
[1:12:15] and here was a man with the most
[1:12:17] powerful gifts since
[1:12:18] jesus christ and let me just say
[1:12:22] it was more than a gift
[1:12:26] it was more than a gift it was the
[1:12:29] messiah
[1:12:29] sign to this generation to vindicate the
[1:12:34] word
[1:12:36] and he would not sell out for money
[1:12:39] popularity
[1:12:40] [Music]
[1:12:42] or schools to be built or or
[1:12:46] compromise and he he would not turn
[1:12:49] around
[1:12:51] i believe that there's come men under
[1:12:54] the message with the same anointing
[1:12:59] and they will have personal struggles
[1:13:02] and they will have difficulties and they
[1:13:06] will have to go through things but they
[1:13:07] refuse to compromise
[1:13:10] or sell out or kingdom build
[1:13:17] the message is not about making stars
[1:13:19] out of preachers
[1:13:22] or even people it's the message
[1:13:26] is the emphasis of the word to transport
[1:13:30] our body
[1:13:33] as the queen of heaven that's the
[1:13:36] finishing of redemption
[1:13:39] that for 2 000 years men and women have
[1:13:43] lived the word
[1:13:45] and went into the ground looking for
[1:13:47] rapture
[1:13:49] under great difficulty brother nathanael
[1:13:53] but they went down in faith believe it
[1:14:04] just as when jesus was on the earth
[1:14:06] there was a lot of multitudes
[1:14:09] but there was a handful of believers
[1:14:12] i want you to catch that phrase there
[1:14:14] was a lot of multitudes
[1:14:16] but there was a handful of believers
[1:14:20] a lot of people attended brother
[1:14:22] branham's meetings
[1:14:23] for a lot of different reasons and he
[1:14:26] would preach sermons and i'm just going
[1:14:28] to give you the titles
[1:14:31] but sermons like modern events
[1:14:35] things that are to be
[1:14:39] the seven seals opened up the entire
[1:14:41] bible
[1:14:44] then he would preach indictment say i
[1:14:46] couldn't have done this 20 years ago or
[1:14:48] 10 years ago
[1:14:49] but i can do it now
[1:14:52] then he would preach sermons a series
[1:14:55] like the trial
[1:14:57] and he would conduct a trial right in
[1:15:00] church
[1:15:05] then he would speak a future home
[1:15:09] and it would open up that what our home
[1:15:12] was going to be like
[1:15:14] when we got there
[1:15:18] no doubt to the people that were
[1:15:20] gathered as a multitude
[1:15:23] a four-hour service was a little much
[1:15:30] but to the bride he's talking about my
[1:15:36] home
[1:15:39] when he's speaking sermons like why
[1:15:41] christ speak
[1:15:46] and he's beginning to stand there and
[1:15:48] tell us that
[1:15:50] faith is a long vision
[1:15:53] keep your focus the word
[1:15:56] will hold right on the target
[1:16:01] then he comes and speaks christ is the
[1:16:04] mystery of god
[1:16:06] revealed
[1:16:09] and how that the preeminence of the
[1:16:11] entire word or the
[1:16:13] entire bible is on jesus christ
[1:16:16] a few weeks ago i spoke on who is jesus
[1:16:20] because the nominal world still don't
[1:16:23] know who he was
[1:16:26] are you with me they still don't realize
[1:16:28] who he was
[1:16:30] and they don't realize that he's came
[1:16:32] again in this day
[1:16:33] to display himself to the bride of
[1:16:36] christ
[1:16:37] and make her a promise i'm coming to get
[1:16:39] you
[1:16:44] are you with me and speak sermons like
[1:16:48] chosen place of worship
[1:16:51] how he bypassed all the great big
[1:16:54] cathedrals and their great big schools
[1:16:57] and their great big education
[1:17:00] and their fine boards and their their
[1:17:02] finery systems
[1:17:04] because jesus came to their place
[1:17:08] and they wanted no part he speaks
[1:17:16] sermons like god is his own interpreter
[1:17:22] what are you saying brother ron
[1:17:25] every one of those sheets of music was
[1:17:28] important
[1:17:32] every one of those sermons was important
[1:17:37] every one of them was important
[1:17:40] and he had to leave himself out of it
[1:17:44] because he wasn't the important one
[1:17:49] the music was the important one
[1:17:53] yes he had struggles but the music was
[1:17:57] the important one
[1:18:04] mary was standing there with an angel
[1:18:08] in luke chapter one
[1:18:13] and verse 30 and i know you've heard it
[1:18:15] redundantly throughout your life
[1:18:19] in verse 30 the angel said unto her fear
[1:18:22] not mary for thou has found
[1:18:24] favor with god i want to say this to you
[1:18:27] you said in here this morning i don't
[1:18:29] know if you
[1:18:30] measure the appreciation of
[1:18:34] having found favor with god
[1:18:40] i have just made a phenomenal statement
[1:18:47] because if you found favor with him it
[1:18:50] affects
[1:18:51] every phase of your life
[1:18:57] did you catch what i just said if you
[1:19:00] found favor with him and you realize
[1:19:03] that you found favor with god
[1:19:06] the infinite god that knows
[1:19:10] exactly how many animals fleas
[1:19:13] ticks whatever he knows
[1:19:17] everything and how the universe rolls
[1:19:19] and yet he's concerned about
[1:19:21] your needs
[1:19:26] his eyes are on the sparrow and i know
[1:19:28] he's watching over me
[1:19:34] that god is concerned about you
[1:19:48] and behold thou shalt conceive in thy
[1:19:50] womb
[1:19:55] and bring forth a son
[1:20:00] and call his name jesus
[1:20:06] and he shall be great
[1:20:10] and shall be called the son of the
[1:20:11] highest
[1:20:13] and the lord god shall give unto him the
[1:20:16] throne
[1:20:17] of his father david and he shall reign
[1:20:21] over the house of jacob
[1:20:23] forever and of his kingdom
[1:20:28] there shall be no end
[1:20:31] all right watch this and mary said unto
[1:20:34] the angel
[1:20:35] how shall this be seen i know not a man
[1:20:41] and the angel answered and said under
[1:20:45] the holy ghost shall come upon thee
[1:20:49] and the power of the highest shall
[1:20:51] overshadow thee
[1:20:53] therefore also that
[1:20:56] holy thing which shall be borne of thee
[1:20:59] shall be called the son of god
[1:21:05] it's as though was the angel saying as
[1:21:08] he's speaking it
[1:21:10] he's going for taking all the
[1:21:14] prophecies even since adam
[1:21:17] and speaking to her it's not an if
[1:21:25] this is not an if are you catching what
[1:21:28] i'm doing here
[1:21:30] this is not an if
[1:21:36] his kingdom will not end
[1:21:45] he's going to be the son of the highest
[1:21:49] his name shall be called jesus
[1:21:56] and his kingdom there shall be no end
[1:22:15] verse 36 and behold thy cousin
[1:22:19] elizabeth she has also conceived a son
[1:22:24] in her old age
[1:22:30] and this is the six months with her
[1:22:34] who was called baron
[1:22:39] now notice these words he's not only
[1:22:42] conscious of mary's womb
[1:22:45] but he's very much conscious of what's
[1:22:48] going on with elizabeth
[1:22:51] in the same meeting
[1:22:54] are you with me now and he
[1:22:58] he now knows that elizabeth was barren
[1:23:04] for with god nothing
[1:23:07] shall be impossible
[1:23:11] now notice how mary responds
[1:23:14] she does not respond with the struggle
[1:23:20] are you with me she does not respond
[1:23:24] with the struggle immediately she must
[1:23:28] in her humanity must know
[1:23:31] if i'm caught with a child before i'm
[1:23:34] married
[1:23:35] they'll stone me they'll call me a
[1:23:38] matter of names which they did do
[1:23:42] she didn't look at the the problems that
[1:23:45] she was going to have to face
[1:23:47] and go i can't do the job
[1:23:53] i'm preaching to you now i'm preaching
[1:23:56] to you now
[1:23:58] all of your list of excuses god says
[1:24:01] they don't
[1:24:02] matter all of your pettiness and all of
[1:24:06] your
[1:24:07] nonsense and all of the things that you
[1:24:10] say
[1:24:10] i can't make it through it don't matter
[1:24:13] no way
[1:24:16] why don't you just tell the devil of all
[1:24:18] of your humanity struggle
[1:24:19] it don't matter
[1:24:23] are you with me sometimes we look at the
[1:24:27] and here are going to go sometimes we
[1:24:30] look that
[1:24:31] mary is going to deliver the child
[1:24:36] to the world but the big picture was
[1:24:42] the word that she was bringing forth
[1:24:46] was going to deliver her
[1:25:01] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:25:05] it would deliver her
[1:25:09] black it would sustain her
[1:25:14] she would be given the opportunity
[1:25:17] to carry the child
[1:25:20] all of their nonsense and all of their
[1:25:23] making fun
[1:25:27] and at no point whatsoever did she have
[1:25:31] to help
[1:25:31] god
[1:25:33] [Applause]
[1:25:36] at no point do you have to help god here
[1:25:40] just enjoy him
[1:25:43] just radiate in his presence oh i feel
[1:25:45] like
[1:25:47] just enjoy the word of god and let it
[1:25:50] live
[1:25:52] just eat the book eat the book
[1:25:56] and the word will begin to develop on
[1:25:59] the inside of your life
[1:26:02] it will bring forth
[1:26:09] because remember it wasn't part mary
[1:26:13] and port part god
[1:26:19] remember it wasn't part mary impart god
[1:26:22] it was all god
[1:26:24] [Applause]
[1:26:27] are you with me it was all god
[1:26:31] from that point she was pregnant
[1:26:36] from that point she was pregnant
[1:26:40] from that point she was given a
[1:26:42] testimony
[1:26:44] i'm carrying a child it didn't matter
[1:26:47] what joseph said
[1:26:49] it didn't matter what elizabeth said it
[1:26:52] didn't matter what the high priest said
[1:26:54] she was carrying the christ child
[1:26:56] [Applause]
[1:26:58] it don't matter what they say about the
[1:27:02] message
[1:27:07] i don't have to help the message that
[1:27:10] message is helping me
[1:27:14] the message will live on its own i don't
[1:27:18] have to pop it up
[1:27:19] i don't have to prime it up i don't have
[1:27:22] to decorate it up

[1:27:35] it'll change my body it'll give you the
[1:27:39] right kind of home

[1:27:42] character it'll give
[1:27:43] are you with me now
[1:27:58] hallelujah
[1:28:04] i was given the opportunity to stand in
[1:28:06] a church
[1:28:08] in china
[1:28:14] it was an open-air church
[1:28:17] at really cold temperatures where we
[1:28:20] wrap blankets around ourselves
[1:28:22] to keep warm
[1:28:26] coats we put them on
[1:28:31] i preached there
[1:28:37] and brother murphy we were
[1:28:41] coming through and they were reaching
[1:28:43] out for me
[1:28:46] and i said what are they saying
[1:28:51] murphy said just keep walking
[1:29:00] just keep walking i'll tell you later
[1:29:04] the police were outside the police
[1:29:06] actually came inside
[1:29:09] took pictures
[1:29:13] the pastor of that church was a man
[1:29:16] named caleb
[1:29:19] there was a woman that had been the
[1:29:20] pastor of that church
[1:29:22] before but when she heard the message
[1:29:25] she immediately resigned
[1:29:27] and caleb was there as a young minister
[1:29:29] he took the church
[1:29:32] and he began to pastor that group and
[1:29:34] when i went to preach for him he was
[1:29:36] involved in making sure that bibles got
[1:29:39] where they needed to get
[1:29:40] and messages got where it got it needed
[1:29:42] to get and re
[1:29:43] the translations were getting where they
[1:29:46] needed to be
[1:29:47] and he was a fervent young man
[1:29:52] as many of you know for the last few
[1:29:54] months he's been in prison along with a
[1:29:56] couple of other brothers there's been a
[1:29:58] couple of brothers that have been
[1:29:59] released
[1:30:00] and we can't tell you how that that
[1:30:02] happened but we just
[1:30:04] thank the lord that it happened
[1:30:08] to this point this is now two or three
[1:30:10] months
[1:30:11] brother caleb hasn't had one shower
[1:30:16] he has not been able to bathe one time
[1:30:22] he has not been able to have
[1:30:25] one stable meal a day
[1:30:29] since that time
[1:30:32] but last week he wrote his wife a letter
[1:30:38] and he says my dear wife don't be afraid
[1:30:41] no matter what the result might be
[1:30:45] good or bad i was led here by revelation
[1:30:52] it's not our faith can accomplish
[1:30:56] but our faith toward him
[1:30:59] can accomplish everything
[1:31:02] i love you tell everyone
[1:31:06] what they were before this happened
[1:31:10] that they should be the same right now
[1:31:16] are you listening to me even in my
[1:31:19] absence
[1:31:20] god is still god
[1:31:25] god is not mocked live right
[1:31:33] let our hearts be pure single-eyed
[1:31:37] don't let my love don't let my heart
[1:31:40] grease
[1:31:41] for all of you while i'm in here
[1:31:45] we must prepare ourselves at any time
[1:31:48] and every time
[1:31:50] brother neal who has been entrusted with
[1:31:52] the church
[1:31:53] who was arrested with him but bailed out
[1:31:57] build real true watchmen
[1:32:02] rebuke sin urging people to have a zeal
[1:32:07] of repentance
[1:32:08] they don't need to worry about me at all
[1:32:15] write more letters to brother ping and
[1:32:17] encourage him and the brother in jail
[1:32:20] with brother caleb but they they can't
[1:32:22] meet each other
[1:32:23] now notice how he's doing it
[1:32:27] he's he's telling them now don't connect
[1:32:30] you get in trouble
[1:32:34] but the most important thing is to
[1:32:36] assert assist brother murphy
[1:32:38] in the translations work and do it right
[1:32:44] my heart and my spirit are always with
[1:32:47] you
[1:32:47] and pray for you may the lord keep you
[1:32:51] after all the trials stand
[1:32:59] brother neal be focused
[1:33:06] don't be distracted
[1:33:09] visit the old saints
[1:33:14] did you hear any pity me
[1:33:22] did you hear any pity me
[1:33:26] this week i got a couple of excuses
[1:33:29] about why why their people are just
[1:33:33] you know you know i'm
[1:33:36] it's not even worth telling you
[1:33:40] let me just say this to you god will
[1:33:43] have a bride
[1:33:49] he will have a bride
[1:33:52] he will have a symphony
[1:33:56] he will have people that will be there
[1:33:58] that will stand
[1:33:59] the music will be played
[1:34:04] somebody ought to help me preach
[1:34:16] brother branham will talk about in
[1:34:18] shalom andrew's last quote last night
[1:34:20] was out of shalom and good morning
[1:34:23] and brother branham talks about peter
[1:34:24] and the wolf and how that that conductor
[1:34:27] and how that director he gets in the
[1:34:29] inspiration of that conductor
[1:34:32] and uh and and the man that wrote it
[1:34:35] that composed the music he had a certain
[1:34:38] inspiration
[1:34:39] and he wanted to be written a certain
[1:34:41] way these men
[1:34:43] were absolute mastermind that were
[1:34:46] gifts to be able to to put music
[1:34:50] together
[1:34:51] and it still boggles the mind of some of
[1:34:54] the greatest musicians in the world
[1:34:56] how they could arrange certain things
[1:34:58] and make it to go
[1:35:00] go together in a certain way and then if
[1:35:03] you
[1:35:03] write if you read the books about the
[1:35:07] men that were the composer many of them
[1:35:11] like beethoven became to became deaf
[1:35:16] so he would cut the the the legs off of
[1:35:19] his piano
[1:35:20] so he could hear it against the floor
[1:35:24] and he would play and it was
[1:35:28] in some of that time that he produced
[1:35:30] the best music
[1:35:32] but the struggle was not greater than
[1:35:35] the music
[1:35:39] helen keller's struggle was not greater
[1:35:42] than what she accomplished in life
[1:35:45] fanny crosby her blindness
[1:35:48] was not greater
[1:35:53] are you with me it was not greater than
[1:35:56] what she would accomplish in her life
[1:36:00] your struggles are
[1:36:03] not greater than the message of the hour
[1:36:10] [Applause]
[1:36:20] jesus was standing in a meeting
[1:36:25] and he was standing there and it's only
[1:36:27] hours days
[1:36:30] before he's going to be
[1:36:34] beaten like no other human being sent
[1:36:37] through a
[1:36:38] trial like no other human being and sit
[1:36:41] before a public offering
[1:36:46] of who will you take a rioter
[1:36:50] a murderer or jesus
[1:36:55] and the public outcry was
[1:37:01] we choose baramus
[1:37:11] what you don't understand it's repeating
[1:37:13] again in this day
[1:37:16] not just in america they're headed
[1:37:19] toward a one-world system
[1:37:24] and it's not democrat or republican
[1:37:28] you stick around long enough your
[1:37:29] politics is going to just fall away and
[1:37:31] become
[1:37:32] rotten
[1:37:36] are you with me now listen
[1:37:39] listen they're going to have a pope as a
[1:37:41] leader before long
[1:37:44] it won't be the candidates that you're
[1:37:46] going to vote on in 2020
[1:37:48] it won't matter no way they're going to
[1:37:51] have a leader
[1:37:53] we're going to be gone
[1:38:06] now before all of these events that are
[1:38:09] going to happen in jesus
[1:38:11] because the word is saying and he's
[1:38:13] pressing towards it
[1:38:14] garden of gethsemane is right in front
[1:38:16] of him
[1:38:18] now jesus has a meeting with his
[1:38:20] disciples
[1:38:22] and this is going to be a very important
[1:38:24] meeting
[1:38:26] and he says let not your heart be
[1:38:28] troubled
[1:38:36] i think that sometimes what we ought to
[1:38:37] be hearing
[1:38:40] and get your eyes on what's going on
[1:38:42] here
[1:38:45] you believe in god believe also in me
[1:38:51] in my father's house are many mansions
[1:38:55] and brother brown said he's not talking
[1:38:56] about brick and mortar and stone
[1:38:59] and wood here he's talking about your
[1:39:02] eternal home
[1:39:04] and why was it important brother
[1:39:06] nathaniel that he would talk about
[1:39:08] their their their heavenly home because
[1:39:13] for some of these boys they were going
[1:39:14] to be drugged through the street
[1:39:17] they were going to be beheaded they were
[1:39:19] going to be turned upside down and
[1:39:21] crucified
[1:39:25] the personal struggle that they were
[1:39:27] going to have to go through
[1:39:28] jesus was pointing them beyond that
[1:39:32] struggle
[1:39:35] and when they realized you can destroy
[1:39:37] this body
[1:39:40] well brother ron what's jesus worth i'd
[1:39:43] say
[1:39:43] everything
[1:39:46] when these men that had stood there with
[1:39:49] him and saw these miracles and saw these
[1:39:52] things
[1:39:53] when they received the same life that
[1:39:56] was inside of him
[1:40:01] though today they couldn't understand
[1:40:03] this sermon
[1:40:05] when he's telling them don't be troubled
[1:40:11] you believe in god believe also in me
[1:40:14] i am the way i am the truth
[1:40:18] i am the life there's not another way
[1:40:21] there's not 10 000 ways i am the way
[1:40:25] this is not up for negotiation i am the
[1:40:29] way
[1:40:32] and when those boys are standing there
[1:40:35] and they're going to
[1:40:37] they're going to watch these things
[1:40:39] happen and now they go to an upper room
[1:40:42] and i'm sorry to be discombobulated here
[1:40:44] just for a moment
[1:40:45] but these men are going to go through a
[1:40:48] vacuum of struggles
[1:40:51] of mental thoughts how can these things
[1:40:54] be
[1:40:54] people walking away people screaming
[1:40:58] people screaming crucify him
[1:41:01] when he's healed they're sick he's
[1:41:02] raised they're dead
[1:41:04] he's fed they're four and five thousand
[1:41:06] they've seen
[1:41:07] nothing but good they cannot comprehend
[1:41:11] the redemption
[1:41:12] story that is happening among them
[1:41:17] it is only later that they can look back
[1:41:20] to digest
[1:41:21] some of those things
[1:41:33] andrew put it so well they were hit in a
[1:41:37] cave for 10 days
[1:41:43] they were hit away waiting
[1:41:48] because they knew i can't live this on
[1:41:51] my own
[1:41:54] you put that so well last night so
[1:41:57] sometimes in the darkness we
[1:41:59] we kind of molt we kind of sent to a
[1:42:02] place in our life
[1:42:04] to where we realize i can't do this
[1:42:09] amen i personally can't do this
[1:42:14] and if you haven't went through that
[1:42:17] i'll tell you as a real christian you
[1:42:19] gotta have it
[1:42:23] because it's gonna take more than human
[1:42:26] energy
[1:42:28] i can hold myself brother ron really
[1:42:34] well brother on i can be this way at
[1:42:36] church
[1:42:38] and with other people i can be another
[1:42:40] way
[1:42:42] really really
[1:42:46] well that's called hollywood
[1:42:52] that's truly a mask that you put on
[1:42:56] on sunday and you put another mask on
[1:42:59] the other days
[1:43:04] but at the end of the trip i'll tell you
[1:43:07] what people
[1:43:08] will appreciate the most is the person
[1:43:12] that's real
[1:43:13] every day
[1:43:20] are you with me if your music changes
[1:43:25] i'm sorry i'm tracing something here if
[1:43:28] your music
[1:43:29] changes from today till tomorrow
[1:43:32] here's an altar if your clothing changes
[1:43:37] from here
[1:43:38] to tomorrow here's an altar
[1:43:45] if you think that your friends out there
[1:43:48] are the most important friends
[1:43:50] that you've got in life here's an altar
[1:44:08] people love the nakedness of this world
[1:44:12] but i'll tell you where there's another
[1:44:13] place that's going to be naked
[1:44:16] it's called hell there's no clothes
[1:44:21] there
[1:44:22] as a matter of fact you're going to get
[1:44:23] a new body to go through hell you get
[1:44:25] the same one you're in now
[1:44:29] there's no friends in hell brother on
[1:44:32] but you were so positive
[1:44:34] for a while well let me just tell you
[1:44:35] this this is what god came to save you
[1:44:38] from
[1:44:41] that's what the music is about to save
[1:44:44] you from this kind of a lifestyle
[1:44:48] you play your nonsense backwards of
[1:44:50] music and you get your wife back your
[1:44:52] dog
[1:44:53] back you get your old card back
[1:44:58] you get your best friends back
[1:45:15] and jesus was telling them my thoughts
[1:45:17] are higher than your thoughts
[1:45:21] my words are greater than your words
[1:45:25] now what we do sometimes is we look at
[1:45:27] our personal struggles that we're in and
[1:45:30] we get depressed
[1:45:34] and they overwhelm us
[1:45:37] and we get bottled aware that it's our
[1:45:40] problem
[1:45:40] our little problem listen to me very
[1:45:43] closely now
[1:45:45] i won't be much longer maybe i'll have
[1:45:47] to preach again next week but
[1:45:52] how many of you get so consumed with
[1:45:54] your little itty-bitty problem
[1:45:57] until you'll go through a deal and you
[1:45:59] for weeks
[1:46:01] will be so bottlenecked until you can't
[1:46:04] see
[1:46:05] nothing but you
[1:46:09] am i am i with you
[1:46:19] are you with me i had a sister one time
[1:46:22] in
[1:46:23] oh in a different country she said i was
[1:46:25] consumed with constipation
[1:46:35] and she was very sincere she had been a
[1:46:37] christian for decades
[1:46:39] and she said i was concerned with
[1:46:41] constipation
[1:46:43] and said it was it drew it drove me
[1:46:46] nuts in my life
[1:46:50] until i began to worship the lord and i
[1:46:54] figured out that when i would worship
[1:46:56] the lord
[1:46:57] everything worked well
[1:47:13] i know i know that can bring a smile to
[1:47:15] our thoughts but let me just say this to
[1:47:17] you
[1:47:17] when you put god first
[1:47:22] when you put god first in your life
[1:47:26] he's greater than your cancer
[1:47:29] he's greater than your tuberculosis
[1:47:33] here's greater than your petty problems
[1:47:35] in your life
[1:47:37] he's greater than the prison that you're
[1:47:39] in brother caleb
[1:47:41] he's greater
[1:47:47] he's greater than all that
[1:47:54] now you know you just don't go to a
[1:47:58] symphony and just start playing
[1:48:01] first of all you have to be chosen
[1:48:05] you just don't show up at the national
[1:48:07] symphony with your flute your drum
[1:48:09] your whatever you play and go i want to
[1:48:13] play here
[1:48:15] where's your invitation to play
[1:48:22] well i i want to play
[1:48:26] i'm sorry this is just a chosen group
[1:48:29] you know sometimes people go you guys
[1:48:32] think you're the only ones
[1:48:34] no we got the letter
[1:48:44] we got the letter
[1:48:49] i received an invitation to be a part of
[1:48:51] this
[1:48:53] there's a lot of people want to be a
[1:48:55] part of it but i got the invitation
[1:49:00] it was on the inside of me when i looked
[1:49:03] at this i couldn't see nothing else
[1:49:06] i got the invitation it's been
[1:49:08] vindicating itself for decades now
[1:49:11] i couldn't make myself this i tried i
[1:49:14] tried
[1:49:15] i couldn't make myself this i just let
[1:49:17] it live
[1:49:29] now whether it's a flute or a drum
[1:49:34] in the national symphony because i had a
[1:49:36] cousin that was involved in that
[1:49:38] and she would go a few times a year to
[1:49:40] play they would send her
[1:49:43] they would send her music that they were
[1:49:45] going to play
[1:49:46] and so i'm going to parallel here for
[1:49:48] about five minutes can you hang with me
[1:49:52] and you see in that realm
[1:49:56] they send you the music that you're
[1:49:57] going to play
[1:50:00] you don't choose the music
[1:50:03] that you want to play
[1:50:08] they send you the music
[1:50:11] that you're gonna play
[1:50:15] and every part has a key part
[1:50:18] it's not up for you to change it
[1:50:22] or whether you think that it's it would
[1:50:24] be better here or there
[1:50:26] just play what's on the sheets
[1:50:34] and like elijah and elisha and brother
[1:50:36] brandon preach a second-hand robe
[1:50:39] god does not trim the robe to fit
[1:50:42] elisha he trims elisha to fit the rope
[1:50:47] god's not going to change his word for
[1:50:50] you it's you
[1:50:51] that are going to be changed to fit the
[1:50:54] word
[1:50:55] out
[1:51:03] it's not you're looking for a church
[1:51:05] that'll fit you
[1:51:09] we're not a bunch of politicians are
[1:51:11] here patting you on the back or tickling
[1:51:13] your ears
[1:51:14] we're not gonna beg you bribe you pull
[1:51:17] on you
[1:51:19] we're not going to call you 52 times on
[1:51:22] monday where was you at where was you at
[1:51:24] listen you ought to have enough god in
[1:51:26] your life to get your stinking self up
[1:51:29] out of bed
[1:51:44] i'm gonna preach now for a little while
[1:51:49] there ought to be enough god on the
[1:51:51] inside of you
[1:51:54] this is time for me to go to church
[1:51:57] and when i get there i'm going to have
[1:52:00] church
[1:52:01] i'm not worried about who i'm sitting
[1:52:03] with i'm not worried about what
[1:52:05] everybody else is doing
[1:52:07] i come to have an encounter with jesus
[1:52:11] christ
[1:52:12] i come to worship the lord i come to
[1:52:16] have a meeting
[1:52:17] i come to play my part in the music
[1:52:34] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:52:37] i fell in love with jesus a long time
[1:52:40] ago
[1:52:41] and i may have had to go through some
[1:52:43] struggles in my life
[1:52:45] but my struggles were not greater
[1:52:48] they are not greater than the god that
[1:52:52] lays on the inside of me
[1:53:00] let freedom ring let freedom ring
[1:53:04] let the music sound in my life let it
[1:53:07] sound
[1:53:08] let the message echo
[1:53:16] this ain't no pity party
[1:53:22] i have drove off of this hill for 20
[1:53:24] years
[1:53:29] i have never said going off of this hill

[1:54:16] long and sick in this body
[1:54:18] i come on sunday morning to have church
[1:54:29] i'm not interested in talking to you

[1:54:34] nauseated how much medicine i take every
[1:54:37] morning how much i take it now
[1:54:39] i want to tell you about jesus loves me
[1:54:41] [Applause]
[1:54:43] i want to tell you he loves me so much
[1:54:45] he came from glory
[1:54:47] and he reached down and grabbed the hulk
[1:54:48] of my life and he transformed me
[1:54:52] so i could hear the music
[1:54:57] hallelujah
[1:54:59] [Applause]
[1:55:02] hallelujah

[1:58:14] it's about you and god and at the end of
[1:58:18] the day this
[1:58:19] message that has been so powerfully
[1:58:21] preached
[1:58:22] lives in your life that on rapture
[1:58:25] mourning
[1:58:27] there's not a devil in hell can do to
[1:58:30] stop the music
[1:58:32] from flowing through
[1:58:50] i'm getting ready to finish and this is
[1:58:51] gonna be good this is gonna be good now
[1:59:02] you see if you was
[1:59:03] invited to go to an orchestra
[1:59:06] i actually had that privilege one time
[1:59:08] in my life and i went
[1:59:10] and i sat down and i watched it and i
[1:59:12] thought i was just i was just blown
[1:59:14] apart
[1:59:16] you know i noticed as i look back on it
[1:59:20] you know they came out they all was
[1:59:22] doing their deals and they was warming
[1:59:24] up
[1:59:25] they all took their places first chair
[1:59:27] took the place
[1:59:29] and then the complimentary to the first
[1:59:30] chair
[1:59:33] took their place and they were all
[1:59:35] sitting down
[1:59:38] you know i watched it
[1:59:44] none of those people stood up and said
[1:59:46] you know what i overcome to get here
[1:59:56] none of them got up and told their life
[1:59:58] story
[2:00:01] before the symphony they just warmed up
[2:00:05] because they've been doing that at home
[2:00:09] there was a guy with a stick
[2:00:24] there's a guy with a stick this will
[2:00:27] probably be
[2:00:28] one of the most popular sticks
[2:00:32] in the world now and he walks out there
[2:00:36] and there comes a time and so many times
[2:00:39] won't
[2:00:40] people want the rapture before it's
[2:00:42] actually
[2:00:43] time
[2:00:49] but you see there's some seats that
[2:00:50] still got to be filled
[2:01:00] and sister judy we had to wait on you
[2:01:06] we had to wait on you we thought we'd
[2:01:08] make a rapture 20 years ago we had to
[2:01:10] wait on you
[2:01:12] because you had to play your part and
[2:01:15] some of you children we had to wait on
[2:01:17] you to get here
[2:01:18] because you came from the lamb's book
[2:01:20] and you had to be manifested on the
[2:01:22] earth
[2:01:23] and god's not going to lose a one he's
[2:01:26] so interested in you
[2:01:27] all of this great symphony every seat's
[2:01:30] got to be
[2:01:31] [Applause]
[2:01:34] filled
[2:01:37] [Music]
[2:01:42] and yes some of us been waiting for
[2:01:44] almost 1900 years to play their part
[2:01:48] and they've been telling their stories
[2:01:49] and they've been doing all of this
[2:01:52] but some of us final ones are coming to
[2:01:55] the spot
[2:02:05] everybody gets quiet
[2:02:15] now what happened to all the struggle
[2:02:17] all of that's now behind us
[2:02:22] all of the struggles now behind us and
[2:02:25] we're sitting quietly
[2:02:29] and the cancer that i went through and
[2:02:32] the burns that i've went through
[2:02:38] and the heart attacks and the strokes
[2:02:43] and the problems and i'm sitting in my
[2:02:46] chair
[2:02:50] and it's just me and the music now
[2:02:52] [Music]
[2:02:56] and everybody's quiet in the crowd
[2:03:09] and he turns everybody's at attention
[2:03:16] and he starts waving the stick because
[2:03:18] the stick
[2:03:20] will have no miscues
[2:03:24] and the director and the composer are in
[2:03:26] the same spirit
[2:03:28] through seven ages
[2:03:31] and they begin to play what a day
[2:03:36] that will be
[2:03:39] when my jesus
[2:03:43] i shall see
[2:03:46] when i look upon his face
[2:03:51] the one who saved me by his grace
[2:03:56] and it echoes through the halls
[2:04:01] an amazing grace is played
[2:04:09] and maybe there were certain parts you
[2:04:11] didn't get to play
[2:04:13] well don't you worry
[2:04:16] he's got a part for you
[2:04:22] and he flips a page
[2:04:26] and he kind of looks at you a certain
[2:04:28] way
[2:04:29] and maybe in the whole bible you can
[2:04:32] only find one scripture
[2:04:34] so shamgar is important to play
[2:04:40] because you see you are important to god
[2:04:43] amen
[2:04:48] you didn't think carrying out trees
[2:04:49] would be quite like this did you
[2:04:54] maybe you thought well i'm just gonna
[2:04:56] tire those trees out there

[2:05:19] and then he comes to your part

[2:05:25] bull rush
