this morning but i just have a lot on my plate today and so i got a letter this week and i read it and i read it again and i showed sister connie and just it just it brought me to tears and it was dated february the 1st of 2021 dear brother ron i'm writing this letter to you you're someone who has made a difference in my life you're a great preacher and i love watching you online i enjoyed hearing you in person at christmas i can't wait to see you in person again on the same day thank you for leading everybody at the church to the holy ghost when you talk about god is healing you it raises my faith i love hearing the story about how you dedicated me to god as a baby teddy bowman brother doug bowman and sister chastity bowman's little boy amen god bless you amen amen they're watching this this morning i just sent them a note and let them know that i was going to be reading it amen it brought me to tears and i just think about how great god is how he allows us to cross certain paths i bet you're a happy girl today yeah sister jenny amen god bless you hey my sister connie i haven't found are you are i know you guys are happy i know you're happy you know we sometimes we you know just like your incident sometimes we look back and we just know that the angel of god was right there on the scene in the moment we receive words within seconds of after the accident took place and it just destroyed that jeep looked like every glass is out of it and it looked like every fender and every piece of metal was was somewhat crumpled huge tree there didn't hit it just barrel rolled that jeep and and uh brother alden was there in just a few minutes some of you were there in just a bit i think matthew was there in a little bit no you weren't there so hey man i i don't know everybody was there i didn't see it so but brother brother alden was there real quickly and uh brother greg i don't know if you've been around him a bit but brother greg's mess and he said he said while they were wrecking shannon was given play-by-play what to do what to do what to do and and he said they were he said just as soon as they stopped he said he flipped the switch office let's get out of here i want to hear them tell it and then maybe next week and brother greg said i've lost a couple inches from the seat belt amen it was it was about 9 30 at night and uh i was just thinking all of these things and they had been listening to christ the mystery of god revealed and so i'm i'm sitting in the i'm sitting in the uh in my living room or where we sit connie and i said you know when you get a little older you get a place to sit and so i'd have been a lot more amens on that dale but and i was just reading through christ the mystery of god revealed because i thought if this is the sermon of the day the angel of god was was a part was a part of this and so i was just reading and i and i come down to about in one edition it's uh it's about page 70 another it's a 131 and and i just come down and i hit a certain spot and i just felt something and so i just sent this i just sent this to my family and then i sent this to brother shannon and and brother branham was just saying he said he is the thing he was the prophets he was in them he was in the psalms he was in the history he was in the things to come the same yesterday today and forever hebrews 13 8. if you're writing it down you should be and he said he should be the principal if that's what he is we believe it don't we the congregation says amen then if he that is that then he should be your principle theme of talking of our thinking of our singing of our walks he should be the principal theme of our life and if he's the principal theme of the bible and the bible is in us he should be the principal thing theme of everything we do say or think should be christ and i just sent that right right quickly to brother shannon and here's what he's immediately response to me was brother ron that's the last thing i heard before we wrecked we had church didn't we yeah amen amen so i know the angel of the lord this message is more than just a message here at church or worldwide and and we just are we just are so thankful brother shannon actually sent me a text this morning it was a text to his wife but he sent it to me it's valentine's day couldn't have sent it to a better preacher he could not have sent it to a better preacher i'm not going to give you the details i know you're sitting there eagerly waiting but that was for her and i'm glad it was for her she she deserved every bit of that now and i agree with him amen now i know what he calls you though i know what he calls you but it couldn't have been more timely and the reason i mentioned that is because of you who dream know that if you get startled especially at the end of the dream you remember it very vividly and dreams happen in seconds milliseconds and they're just their brother brandon would stand in a vision right before a person and see their entire life and it doesn't sound like he breaks a sentence but that's just how quick it happens for a spiritual dreamer there's an atmosphere that comes with the dream and so i was startled by by just the sound of the text i normally turn my phone off but last night i didn't and just i got just got startled at the sound of the text just before just before uh about five between 5 30 and 6 o'clock i think this will bless you and that's why i want to just kind of share this with you it sure blessed me brother denny uh it seemed like that in the dream we had been invited to a meeting it was a meeting to where that looked like a small building but a massive crowd you don't sometimes you just don't know how to correlate things small building massive crowd and sister connie and the boys were sitting beside of me and we were sitting in a line and and we were sitting very near the stage and i was sitting on the end of the i i was sitting about where you are and as i was sitting there little did i know that brother branham was going to be the speaker brother bran was dressed in a very beautiful beautiful whitish suit and i just don't have a name quite how what the color would be but it would be somewhere between ivory and white and and maybe somebody that's in the color industry could help me with that out there but it was a suit that it was a suit like i'd never seen it was a fashion of a garment that had never seen quite like it and it looked so incredibly comfortable as i watched him he not necessarily did he did he preach but he just kind of spoke and he just kind of told a few stories and it seemed like in the background you could hear a humming from another realm and the humming was was the song on the wings of a snow white dove and as i sit there and absorbed in that atmosphere brother branham was a young man and we all just knew we were in a special place brother brandon walked over to me right after he finished speaking and he walked over to me and he had a he had a book in his hand and the book was a green bound book and it was one of the original books i i have one in my in my desk and it's a it's the way of a true prophet and that's the sermon that my dad came to the lord that believed brother branham was a prophet and so i heard that many many many times in my life and brother branham just looked at me and said would you like to have this book and he just kind of held it out to me like that when he did i looked at him and i just looked into his eyes and i said brother branham i have believed this message all my life now this is the first time i've ever dreamed of brother branham i believed this message all my life and i preached it all over the world and i've tried to do my best he just looked at me and he said ronald and he just patted me on the cheek he said ronald you're going to get well seemed like the dream went just a few more moments and we we walked out of the building together he looked at me and said would you like to get your picture took with me i said i sure would brother branno i'd love to have my picture took with you and he stood right beside of me the boys william was there and the boys was there and sister connie was there he was standing beside of me he just reached over and patted me on the shoulder and he said homer be here in a few moments i believe he will too now it might not have done anything for you this morning but i've had a prophet come to me in the night and he's told me and i believed him all my life and he stole me from that realm he called me by my name and he told me i'm going to get well and i just so happen to believe it [Music] [Applause] hallelujah now maybe you flip the screen on you can stand but maybe you've flipped the screen on for the first time and don't know what's going on here but they say they say that i have store four stage cancer brain tumors that are malignant and also in my lungs and and trying to attack my kidneys and dr dr renahan just called me not this last wednesday but the wednesday before and had a conference with me she said we speak of you every day here at the cancer center since you're setting records you're a miracle you're an absolute miracle said if you can make two years you'll be in the one percent category and i said i believe i'll make it and so when i when i get to see the cancer doctor on the 24th i'm going to tell her i know i'm going to make it amen i know i'm going to make it amen isn't he good to us amen sometimes he just sends us little things by faith and just kind of sparks this and you know i i get letters every week that from people that's got cancer and got all different conditions in their life and they're just sparked by our testimony and and pastors write me and they they they played different things this week a brother from durban south africa wrote me and told me how much that our testimony has meant to the to his congregation and and to the area there well i sure i sure wasn't expecting it but but when when it came my lot in life i i want this body to be a place where god can do a miracle and his brother royce roosebury said it would be a a lion's den to where no one had ever walked out of and boy it's been a really tough battle it's been a battle for a year we take chemo treatments and dr renahan told me just the other day she said you're on the highest chemo treatment the most advanced that we've got and so i asked her i said what did what if i would go off of it maybe 30 days and get a break from it she said we'd be right back at square one but but we want to thank god for being a healer we want to thank god for being a healer maybe there's people that don't believe in doctors but i thank god for good doctors and they're believers and and uh they're believers in god and and so they pray with me and talk with me and have been a real encouragement to me and i'd like to thank you for every prayer that you have prayed for me throughout this last year and so we thank the lord for that any good i thank sister carney so many times for taking care of me and matthew for holding my hair back so i can and so and these boys have been so great to me and and if you don't know what goes on a lot of times during the week i have a bad week and we just try to get ourselves in good shape so we can preach to you for a few days for a few hours and you catch and so and so we want to thank you for your prayers and thank you god just gives us little boost of things to to let us know and i look back at the original note this morning and it said if you'll trust me i'll use you like never before amen and he has he has been faithful in that only just a few moments just a few moments before that i saw a vision of of of sister anna uh bringing up bringing a little child down to the down to the uh come down to the altar and sister anna that it might boost your faith it was a little girl amen sometimes we just need a boost of faith and i'd never been allowed to to say that before so so i've said it now and you know i'm not the one that has to bring it to pass god said it's going to happen this is a special service and i'm going to treat it that way i'd like for you to turn with me to first john chapter 1 and verse 1. so don't even worry about it if it's coming amen [Music] trying to get my composure here for a moment amen that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled to the word of life for the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that you also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son jesus christ and these things right we unto you that your joy may be full this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that god is light and in him there is no darkness at all amen maybe you have a need on your heart this morning you just like to raise it before the lord and amen almighty god we love you with all of our hearts and today has already been a very special day in the spencer home and lord now we ask you that you would come and touch our hearts and minister to us as we would speak lord now we ask you that you'd come in a mighty way lord just settle this audience into an atmosphere of angelic anointing lord of a special place of where we're at and what is taking place oh god minister to us just even now every hand that has been risen mine included lord i ask you to give me strength in the moment that as i speak give me vocal strength give me energy this morning i pray that you'd bless even my wife and touch her body she's been so faithful to care and take care of me and god as i've prayed lord don't let me be a burden to nobody lord and lord you came and brought us an assurance this morning oh god thank you for a visit from that realm touch us even now anoint these words place them exactly where they need to be in jesus christ's name we pray amen and amen and amen you may be seated we realize and we have been speaking to you on a champion over the last few weeks and we realized that you cannot be a champion without being trained and the training has to come even sometimes from another from another realm because you can have talent but there's a lot of people that are talented that get nowhere in life actually most talented people become lazy people because they rely on their talent and then they become uncommitted people because they they rely on the talent that they've got and so it squandered in life in the in the carnal realm even the militaries the united states has a a readiness program for their military they don't have two weeks to get ready for battle they don't have a year to get ready for battle there has to be a front line of men that are ready that are tuned in not not hours to be ready but seconds to be ready jesus was speaking 2 000 years ago and he told us to be ready brother homer's last sermon would be be ready listen these things are not by chance and it's not just somebody else getting us ready you gotta be ready everybody especially in the olympic season everybody wants to be the one with the gold hanging around their neck but you don't realize the cost of the hours and years that it has taken for them to stand on that stage and then even in the moment everything has to be exactly right for the performance the performance to be ready that they would be at their top notch every muscle every twitch every reaction even the food that they eat they watch over it as it's going in they make sure they're not putting any pollutants in their body they don't want nothing nothing to deter especially as they're getting into the final phase of the training i believe that's where we are as a bride we're not a little girl anymore [Applause] listen when brother branham starts talking about in 62 the heavens are announcing the bride on the earth and then after the seals from one from the opening of the book from one sermon to another sermon brother man said i'm no longer probing when you hear when you hear the sermon christ the mystery of god revealed let me just say this you never a man had had the ability to be able to stand and the entrusted word to be able to stand and stand at a pulpit and speak a sermon like christ the mystery of god revealed are you with me from one summer sermon after another brother branham in his last five sermons would talk about the gene seed of god his last of course his last statements was at a communion service but there was a service just before that called leadership he will say more in that sermon than any leadership course or book that you will ever read in your life because he is preparing a group of people to live and reign in another dimension and not just there but we would be able to have comfort that we're walking in two worlds at the same time even now we watch brother branham walk in two worlds speak in two worlds just to bring you to a couple thoughts a man named spurgeon who's one of the greatest preachers to ever live on the earth a man named spurgeon initially because of the printing press came on the scene just before him and he was one of the first preachers to take advantage of it and he would and he would have every sermon every sermon would be ready and go to press and as you would walk in the building they would hand you the sermon and he would preach that sermon that weekend and they would print into the hundreds of thousands of of each sermon and he had a school of preachers and he was a different sort of a man but he had a school of preachers and and i'm not trying to point you to him just now but many of you read his his morning devotionals and evening devotionals he's got great things to say you have to weed your way through the trinitarian doctrine but that's that's all the light that they had it that day but anyway i read it i read it every morning and so anyway anyway anyway spurgeon would say that we have this in copy form and there's actually some of the sermons actually went into the millions because some sermons had more power than others just like all of us have and then but he he would tell his ministers he said don't you dare touch that book of revelations that seals because there's going to come a profit [Applause] and he will reveal those seals and then he would say this for that would be astounding to me he said now we have been given the opportunity to to get the script to where we could we could reproduce it in book form he said but there will come a time to where they'll be able to catch it and be able to hear the voice of that prophet so we realize as brother branham i'd like to take you back into a couple of sermons here brother branham says in countdown he said we're not living back in the horse and buggy age now that was good for its day as a matter of fact in some of even the greatest civilizations the fastest thing on the earth was a horse right and so horse was a coveted animal especially if it was a fast horse the olympics that even when jesus was here there was there was games that would go on paul would talk about those games and paul would write many different verses based on the influence of those games many run but one gets the prize let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us are you with me and let us run and he would tell us they do it for a carnal realm but we do it for an immortal [Applause] just kind of gathering your thoughts now and so we can see that civilization was pushing forward but jesus should stand on the earth two thousand years ago and he would tell us about what kind of time that we would be in we would be at in as it was in the days of noah so will it be in the coming of the son of man as it was in the days of lot sodom and gomorrah so will it be in the coming of the son of man seven dispensations later we are living in the conditions that jesus talked about [Applause] are you with me 2 000 years ago jesus talked about there would be a people on the earth and he would ask a question when i return will i find faith i'd like to stand here and amen it today i'm here [Applause] the scripture would tell us behold i send you elijah the prophet before the great and dreadful day of the lord and and let me just say this you there is a people that catch the message and let me just say it was more than a preacher it was more than an evangelist more than a prophet because a lot of people even in that day saw the angel of the lord and they missed the message a lot of people fell in love with the messenger and missed the message but the message is jesus christ that's the mystery to you you are the mystery the mystery is your name was written in the book and you're living in this day and you can read your name in this book and realize who you are in hebrews 11 it talks about men of faith and women of faith by faith enoch and you read nowhere about his family but by faith enoch he walked with god and he was so perfect until god took him and he would be a type being the seventh from adam of getting a translation there is a people on the earth that's walking in a realm yes adam's going on yes the governments are corrupt yes the world is is falling apart yes fukushima had a massive earthquake yesterday at 7.4 earthquakes are happening everywhere it's supposed to be that way yes we've got scoffers yes we've got our critics but it's supposed to be that way somebody asked me the other day how do i dress my critic and i told them thank them because they are vindicating you [Music] they're not trying to tear up brother brother oral roberts or billy graham people leave the message and they have such a hatred against the prophet and the preachers till they turn around don't just walk away but they turn around and hate it they're anointed to do that to prove to you that you are who you are it's a part of your training it's a part of your training because if it's just your whim of a thought you can't stand on that if it's just a sensation that went up and down your spine a time or two in a service that will hold you but when you have went through wars in this realm and god has watched over you he's guided you he's been your thinking he's been your thoughts he's been your songs he's been your joy and he's went through with you through the valley of the shadow of death and you come to a point in your life there's nothing that can shake you from this infallible truth brother branham said you must realize that satan is not scared of me so if we take that he's not scared of you but he said he's scared of who i represent so if we take that he's still to who i represent [Applause] and then brother random if you notice in just the next sentences he says i hate him and he hates me you think for a second that them crazy democrats and republicans up there love each other they have told you over the last year of how much that they disdain each other's they have showed that they are absolutely from the pit of hell [Applause] they might say go how i love jesus at their little normal church services but they're not proving it in their halls of congress that's how much satan hates you if he could go get my little blue knife back here on my desk if he could he'd destroy you in a moment's notice his meetings in hell is about you internet the meetings in hell is about you now in the journey that i'm in about a year ago they they gave me a death sentence and then the next few weeks a year ago they removed a tumor somewhere between the the size of a lemon just above that and it was fully malignant and it spilled out into my brain and then there's two more that's in there and then the lungs were full of tumors and i would say after a year satan is about to decide i didn't bring enough i carry this in my pocket every day brother alden gave it to me and he had it made from case themselves and they inscribed on it for me he don't have enough [Applause] now i don't know who the worker was that was inscribing that on my knife that i'm going to carry the rest of my life i bet he looked at that and he went he don't have enough [Applause] what is what is that saying he don't have enough well i want to explain it just in case he gets this sermon yes satan brought his best [Applause] and he got his biggest baddest demon yeah and he said you're going to go into ron spencer's body and you're going to send tumors malignant all over his body and you're going to kill it take all the help that you can get and when he showed up he's still been fighting for a year and i'm getting stronger every day because he didn't breathe or not [Applause] hallelujah [Music] hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah amen now maybe you're looking this morning and you're you're one of those that hone in on certain things and you get bound by it and it'll take you a half an hour to go brother ron's got new glasses well i want to answer it for you less than a month ago they said they're going to send me to a specialist to to to be to where that i won't see double people everywhere because i was seeing double i was having a lot of trouble with my glasses and one would say it's the sugar that you're on because i can be 50 in the morning 600 or i can wake up with a 600 figure or be above 600 and and it just just is a difficult situation and was blurring my vision and so they was going to send me to a specialist and they were going to send me to a specialist maybe they could do an operation to put my vision back together but i remember there was a sermon that's called take it back [Music] [Applause] and i sister connie still says that that's the sermon that was preached at brother tim pruitt's that made the devil so mad and so we got to praying about it and i walked into a a colonial eye and the guy looked at me said how you doing ron and i said well i'm doing really good i got a problem and he told and he said well and he said just look and he looked and looked me he said i believe those glasses will bring your eyes back into focus well you know what i just i i do everything if i order a pair of socks i get ten pair if i i like a shirt i get two shirts if i like a certain pair of pants that has to be cut off by sister betty i'll get four pair if i like a certain suit i'll get two pair i'll get two suits so i just went on and ordered two pair of glasses you if you come to church sometimes and i've got sunglasses on you realize i ordered the wrong i brought the wrong pair fortunately for you this morning i got my good glasses on and they're not dark transitions but i'd like to report to you this morning i don't see two of you i see one of course when your sugar goes up it makes you get blurry out and get double vision god's going to heal that too and you say well brother ron that shouldn't be so difficult well let me just tell you what a miracle that is i'm not having to guess where my words are on the page so this morning i want to speak to you and we are the champion you see jesus christ is our champion [Applause] are you with me now he is our champion and he conquered death hell and the grace and i was in him and now he's in me and it's not this flesh that's the champion but i want you to if you could see past what you see and think past what you think there is a champion that is on the inside of you he will not lose he said what are we afraid about possess the gates we have god's promise we have his word we have his holy spirit the angels are encamped about he said everything's in order every wall can be took down it's already took down the son of god goes before us his banners are a wave and there's nothing that can stand in the way of a saint going to meet the promise of god death can't stop it the grave can't stop it that devil can't stop it we are more than conquerors [Applause] sickness is conquered for you death is conquered for you unbeliever won't you receive him habits has been conquered for you temptations has been conquered you say i got a temper i can't get over it it's conquered [Applause] it's already conquered you're sitting under the sound of my voice and you say well brother ron i'm sitting on the edge of the fence today let me say i choose jesus [Applause] i choose jesus today are you with me i choose jesus in every situation of my love because he's already conquered everything that can be conquered [Music] well brother ron i don't know well here's a young man that only seconds something spoke to him and said get up out of the hole and in seconds that hole that was about 20 foot deep was full of water he would have been drowned in just seconds with the force of that water pushing down he'd be gone there's one funeral that we would have had but satan didn't bring enough hallelujah two boys flipping in a jeep listening to christ the mystery of god revealed don't tell me that there was an angels that was guarding that jeep in the middle of the air [Music] hallelujah without a scratch when brother steve got hit by a train and that train rolled that vehicle like a tin can and destroyed everything he got out of that vehicle with his bible in his hands and walked over to sister mary's house and he said i've been hit by a train [Applause] and then the pillar of fire shows up at his funeral and goes backwards and crossed the flowers listen als didn't take steve thomas away als was defeated it was concrete so i want to say to the realm of hell who is the champion [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] this may be my last time to speak before the miracle happened so i might as well go ahead and tell it on this side satan you're defeated you have been defeated and you might as well take your pocket lives back to hell with you that ron spencer is healed this group is healed the people that we've been praying for are healed in the name of jesus christ because our champion has showed up [Music] [Applause] sometimes you just got to draw the boundary lines just gotta draw the boundary lines and say let's fight you've been training for months and you're ready and now the bells are ringing and they've called your name and you've stepped through the ropes you might as well look at him while the referee's talking and telling you all the rules you might as well look at him and tell him you're defeated [Applause] if we could hear david say it today's your last day today is your last day you know jesus preached about hell actually more than he preached about heaven so it's a real place so let me go over to goliath's camp just for a few minutes you know a lot of people really liked goliath they looked up to him they looked up to him they see his muscles they could see his height they could see his stature and they'd watched him kill man after man after man but none of them believed today was his last day [Applause] he got up and he ate his 12 eggs for the last time he ate all of his pancakes for the last time he shook his big old brownie head for the last time he started putting his armor on and everybody was doing and gone but they didn't realize he's doing it for his last time satan i want you to listen to these sermons [Music] we're doing this for our last times we're getting ready to take a body change and you can have this earth you can have their government you can have all the cars you can have all the sports arenas you can have all your music you can do what you want to but call me gone come on [Music] he walked down off of the hill and he started screaming again just like he'd been doing for a long time but his problem was somebody showed up that could do something about it you know the denomination they can scream and they can holler dress any way you want a dress ain't whipping no devils like that but when he shows up here he showed up at a good place to get whipped [Applause] i could hear down in hell satan starts sending out his notices go down there to go down there to to spotswood trail go down there and you have to go to service please dope please don't send me down there do you know who they got singing he's wild [Applause] and his brother's big and pruning if he can't whip me in the flesh he went in the spirit and that that resonated god's wild and those people that go there i remember what they used to be we used to have a host of those people and they don't live like they used to and when we show up at their house they kick us out yes they take that book and run us out every time know there'll be times to where that we feel like we've almost got them and they'll we can even make them think doubtful thoughts and then all of a sudden they'll go hey wait a minute hey hey wait a minute that didn't come from god that came from the devil now satan you take that thought you take those words and get out of here because greater is he that is in me than he that's in the world if you abide in me and my words abide in you ask what you will and it shall be done unto you [Applause] brother brahm said i'm so glad that a man could so completely serve god till the devil don't know what to do with him i want to fulfill that quote in my life i want to be that kind of a people just a reality check here am i preaching like a man that's got stage four cancer [Music] [Applause] [Music] he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army now you know that quote can lay there for a long time and not have any effect but when you get it when you get it when you get it satan's got a problem let me just say it let me just say it in a real good manner in a behavior moment when you get it not when somebody tells you but when you get it not when somebody convinces you but when you get it when you get it when you get when you get it when you get it when it's more than just a good theory when it's more than just a good idea but when you get it when you really figure out who you are worried about you worried about covet brother on i got something a lot worse than coping [Music] but when you get it [Applause] when you get it this is more than just about going to church and getting your favorite pew but when you get it when you figure out hey i'm the one that god's talking about i'm the one that that little prophet was talking about [Applause] when you realize that you are the attribute of god that god thought of before the foundation of the world and he had a little prophet saying you were on your way and you have arrived and when you stand up with this message that is thus saith the lord and look the devil in the eye come on that's why satan fights you so hard because you take a word that he knows he's whipped by [Music] come on he how many of you at times the devil's whispered in your ear and said that ain't the truth let's go ahead and raise your hands he's whispered in your ear that ain't the truth that he tried to make you doubt it do you know that booger was in every prayer line he was in every prayer line and he stood there and tried to get the people to disbelieve all over the building black lines and shadows everywhere and and and the people's name were called their addresses told what the doctors was sometimes 20 different things and he watched them full of cancer go from here to here and there was no shadow no more the scripture said that the devil believes in one god and he trembles [Applause] i want to give you a news bulletin you can put it on fox cnn all you want to the devil lucifer himself believed brother branham was a prophet [Applause] i don't have to apologize i want to go one more the devil himself even lucifer knows i'm in the rapture he knows it he knows it he's got our picture on his bulletin board [Applause] brother tim brother donny i want to be in satan's top 10 hated i care less about being in top 10 down here on earth but down in hell i want to be in the top ten most hated preacher are you with me because then i know for sure i'm his enemy and i'm not afraid not afraid and i'm not afraid and i'm not afraid now my critic might hear this sermon and in a few weeks the lord decides to take me home and they laugh and laugh but what they don't see is i got angel pallbearers and the devil knows as this fight goes on he's getting wore out now i'm going to get a little carnal here just for a moment because i'm coming to a close i always loved it when muhammad ali saw he had his opponent whipped it was then that he sailed in i love that yeah i love that yeah i know where it come from when he noticed had him whipped that's when he pulled every barrage that he could pull and he went in for the kill god gave me the strength the devil is whipped and we all know he's ripped [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hallelujah [Music] you got your armor on you got your praise same song hallelujah you got your scriptures on hallelujah we're way past doing a little bit of training we're in the battle and all the training has been worth this moment hallelujah i'm one of them i'm one of them i'm so glad i can say i'm one of them serving the lord for 40 years preaching this message all this time it was worth it this morning to hear my name called ronal because he didn't know me in this realm but when he stepped into that dream he knew me and he was young ronald you're gonna get well [Applause] i've left out a whole lot of notes but i this this sermon's a declaration to you this morning i'm gonna get well [Music] brother ron that was just a dream you can continue standing musicians to come was it just a dream when he met me in the office and he told me about the greater esther before she had a blane brain bleed i'd say he's got her in his hands brother tim sent me a picture yesterday of her with her roses standing with that big smile you see i i heard the lord say the greater esther i don't know if the little esther is listening right now but if you'll remember only just a second before the greater esther was mentioned he said i'll take care of the little i'll take care of esther but it's the greater esther you see i i don't have to embellish this story because i was there you want to you want to talk about 42-inch grizzly bear or 42-inch horns brother biscuit was there when brother bud was doubting the vision he's going down off and he said i i can't see i can't see that silver tip nowhere and i'm looking for miles and he just simply asked him said are you doubting the vision no no brother branham i'm not doubting the vision and he said there he is here he come and then brother bud would say later said when he fell at his feet he said i'm glad you said you got him with one shot amen what about georgia carter laying into bed over nine years and had a little book in her hand with a family full of unbelief yeah are you with me what about a congressman up shaw 66 years sitting in a meeting and god touched him and reached into his life i don't know what your condition is no matter where you're at in the world when you hear this sermon
