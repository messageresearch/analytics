there you were thinking of us father in Lord Jesus if he would had to do all that for one Lord Jesus you would have done it father what love what matchless love father and then as we think Lord of your road to the cross father where you had to complete that full redemption and he sat there in pilot's judgments Hall father and he took that crown of thorns and he took them stripes upon that holy nor do you never send one time in your life because you're holy because you're God but he sat there lorded because you had a word to fulfill you had a people God that was to be expressed upon the earth and he took him straps you took him stripes and patterned on tails upon your back and no doubt father Lord there's no doubt in my mind you were thinking of us you were thinking of our needs there was it was a prophecy in Isaiah lore that said you had to be bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace had to be upon you nor we worship you for this we worship you for what you've done Lord and father God we lived Eve each and every need father Lord that was read across his pulpit this evening or meet each every need father Lord this the ones that are at home sick or

go to praise the Almighty God begins to draw near the father you're saying the sons of Zion Lord we don't have the voice capacity to sound it off like John did you talk about a shout service where the whole heavens and earth were to shout worthy is the lamb father pray that you would just give us in our human vessels the capacity to be able to express it to our neighbor express it to our loved ones or Express how great you are amongst us and the things that you're doing well God we know that no no man and no tongue could tell God for the marvelous acts that we've seen amongst us they've been you the whole time Lord to think that you've had us in your hand the whole of our life and to think that you're here the here to speak to every one of your children's needs father seeing the prayer requests that were lifted unto you father now we ask God that you go on the scene for you to father pray as I just begin to step myself aside here father pray that you had just taken control of the order of this service father and studying these things looking over these things father what it needs is is the capping of the Holy Spirit to call cap this service off of the name father we've been looking at this law on the god omnipotence if you're all-powerful father I believe you you will show yourself request is that you show yourself in every individual life here by the way of the Internet those listening in South Africa and gone on different places Oh God it notes every week the blessings Lord Jesus II services have been through God Lord I pray you reach now I can't do it father I'd love to be able to do it for him but daughter Katie humbly ask for Jesus and take control now give myself over to thee the building of I came to just Jesus bless you if you have your Bibles you turn with me over to 2nd Kings chapter 2 and 11 second Kings chapter 2 and verse 11 again we would like to speak to you on introducing the god of omnipotence sure thank the Lord for the word that our prior pastor was able to speak to us last weekend and and just to me it was a very divine Oracle of God to be able to speak to us to tell us to look past what we see to look past what we feel to me that came from another realm and and that's what we want to do here tonight is to look past look past what we see and look past this flesh of humanity and just look to his word just for a moment 2nd Kings chapter 2 and 11 and it came to pass as they still want went on and talked that behold there appeared a a chariot of fire and horses of fire and and parted them both asunder and Elijah went up by whirlwind into heaven and Elisha saw it and cried my father my father the chariot of Israel and the horseman thereof and he and he saw him no more and he took hold of his own clothes and read them into pieces and he took up also the mountain of Elisha that fell from him and went back and stood by the bank of Jordan and he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and smote the waters and said where is the Lord God of Elijah and when he had also spent in the waters they departed hither and thither and Elijah went over and god bless his word he may be seated in the presence of the Lord we truly believe that that in this hour in this moment in time that we have been seeing a God of power been displayed in front of us and here as we've read over this scripture reading for the last three services that we've taken that that God was here in his prophet Elijah and here God was taking him off the scene as it were and taking him on but we know that Elijah did not die but Elijah was translated and there there we see the second rapture in the Bible and we see here as Elijah is coming down at the closing out hours of Elijah's ministry and we watch and we were watching Elijah in this very critical moment in his own life to see whether God was still present or not and here we see Allah says he stands there and he's standing under he's stunned standing under one of the greatest ministries that has ever been in in the time of the prophets it's been in a time of the Bible as as we would speak but here Elijah has been God's vindicated messenger and he's done the miraculous and he's done the supernatural and here Elijah is standing there and he's asked this petition of the of Elijah that he would give him a double portion of his spirit and allowed to give him a commission he said now when you if you see me when I go then you'll know that you have these things and here Elijah is watching these things and as we watch as Elijah is on the other side of the Jordan with Elijah he smites the waters and he walks across now we're coming down to a very critical moment in Elijah's ministry it's the beginning of his ministry as his servant Elijah has just went off the scene by the chariot of fire just familiarizing yourself with the story just now but we're watching as Elijah comes down to these waters it's in a moment when when maybe he's in a moment of despair or a moment where he don't know what to do but it was a moment when God would show up and we watch as Elijah's last miracle was Elijah's first miracle and it was showing to us that the same life and the same spirit of Allah had came back upon his servant alive so this was a spirit of Christ that was upon his prophet Elijah and here he was showing that the same prophet Elijah that had walked over before was now the same God that was with Elijah and the same God that was with Elijah and the same God was with Elijah he was showing that he was able to do and repeat the process again he was showing that he was God over nature he was God over the circumstances and Allah says that a paw at a spot when the the critics and the skeptics are on the other side of the bank you're talking about a spot in life and you think you got critics and you think you got skeptics or people looking at you and Laodicea but there is a time when when everybody in those on the other side of the river and you're the only say or you're the only man standing there you're all by yourself you ain't got nobody else with you ain't got yourself where you can sit down talk to your pastor talk to your prophet well my prophet just went away and I don't have nobody to talk to but it was a spot in which God would show up and you see Elijah knew where he was standing at a loss and knew who he was he knew he was called to this spot in life because you see he had seen when Elijah watched him as he was there plowing in the field and Elijah to his mat or overall him it was showing that he had chose him to be his successor now we realize today that there is going to be a continuation of the ministry of Christ it is not a succession of brother branham's ministry we're not looking for his son to take over we're not looking for another man to take over but we are watching a continuation of the Ministry of Jesus Christ and we are told that Elijah and Elijah is a perfect type of Christ and His Church and we are seeing here a type of you and I with Christ showing that the same works that he did is the same works that you and I will do so if Christ did it then it's got to be a body on earth right now that would do the same thing that Jesus did 2,000 years ago if is the god of omnipotence if he is the God of all power if he is the god of omnipresent that means he's got to be here that means he's got to show up when you come down to a spot of criticism that's a god that you can count on when your brother ain't there when your neighbor ain't there God's there when the people that stood with you no longer stand with you that's a god that's still standing there's a God that is here and he's moving and he's acting and he's receiving blessings from his children as they allow him to walk through their life I like to read this to you again as we read it but from the second inotrope when he came down to that Jordan down to the Jordan to face the critical world what did he cry where is the god of Elijah it wasn't the robe of Elijah the donut it was the power of God other lyza that had done it and the thing the world needs this morning is the power of God of Elijah you might have spoke of tongues and shouted and run over the floor but what we need hallelujah what we need is the power of the God of Pentecost to produce the lives and things that was lived in that day in the apostolic hour a second-handed robe was alright hallelujah but he needed a fresh call in his heart from God he needed a fresh anointing from God he wore a second-handed robe when he came to the river but he needed a brand new first hand a call from God and a first handed power from God to perform the miracle and my brother don't you be afraid to ask God anything you must demand God or ask God for anything that is promised for if I am introducing a god that's omnipotent and all-powerful if I be a servant of God I must do the works of God and if I do the works of God I must be a man of God to bring these things to pass because he's demanding of me to produce the impossible I have to ask him I have to call upon him and stand there and say God you promised it so do you every person you shall receive power after the Holy Spirit has come upon you after the holy spirit has come upon you after your robe that's a Christian after your faith is set in Christ then you shall receive power there you are you see it's not something that you have to work yourself up into you're not going to have to stand there and watch deep calleth to the deep and watch all those things that transpire across the earth across the platform and you try to come there and stand behind the platform try to act like William Branham did it's nothing it's nothing that you have to work yourself up into those things are sovereignly given and those things are given by God and if God wants to display his power no matter if it's it maybe it's in a widow that he wants to display his power to it is God that is sovereignly giving those things and it's God that is sovereignly doing those things so it's not something that we work ourselves up into but there is a power that lays on the inside of the bride of Jesus Christ no matter what how long you been a Christian you may have never seen one miracle in your own entire life except for your transformation of your soul but God will bring you down to the very last of your life and all of a sudden he'll call you to your ministry as a housewife to call things back into an order and that God was showing up in your life you didn't work yourself up into it but there was a capacity of the Holy Ghost on the inside of you all of that time but he was waiting for one moment to display himself through you hallelujah you see what good does it do to preach a god of history if he isn't the same today brother sister I say this I read I read of a God of history one time I read of him in books I read of him in the Bible but one day I met him I met him he came to me told me not to drink or smoke her to fly myself and he had something for me to do and when I got a little older I just a little boy and he proved that he did it and here's his picture hanging right here now if sign has tooked it the world knows that he's proved it among gay he knows every thought in your heart he's proved his if the same God today he's not a God of history don't be just don't let the world smuggle you down with the smut and stuff of the world believe him right now so if we're preaching to you a god that is Hebrews 13:8 that means he's got to be the same in every detail in every aspect of who he is that means he can't change but there's a people there are people that that say that they're followers of Christ or or they say that they're followers of the message but they never have met him now how can you be a follower if you've never met him but if you have met him you can say I know in whom I have believed I know in whom there is power but the resurrection that baptized my soul afresh and he's good enough to take me out of this world and take me into a body where I feel no pain where I feel no anguish hallelujah the Bible says in Ephesians 3 and 14 notice what the word Paul is presenting here that this is a part of your inheritance as a parallel between a Joshua and Ephesians but here Paul was presenting a prayer for spirits of strength and Paul says this for this cause I bow my knees under the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named notice for this cost verse 14 4:16 that he would grant you according to the riches of the glory of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man not just this flesh not just your spirit but the inner man that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that he being rooted and grounded in love notice what Paul was presenting to you is that he is praying the prayer over you he's praying the prayer of spiritual strength overtop of you the children of God Paul knew the power of prayer and God and and Paul knew that there was power over praying over the Church of Ephesus now if that be so in that day it's gotta be the same thing today and as I watch as you're as her pastor as he prays for your strength by the rain as he prays for your natural abilities out watch as God shows forth his power shows forth his strength in your life you see now notice in the Smyrna church age he said you see the one difference between Israel and the rest of the nation was God that was the key he said you put God to one side and Israel is like any other nation he said when Samson cut off his hair he was like any other man now notice he said you put the leadership of the Holy Ghost aside and the church is nothing but the world with God's name attached to it whoo hallelujah put the leadership of the Holy Ghost aside put him in your box put him where you don't want him and the church is nothing but the wall with God's name attached to it I don't want to come borrowed over this chart to her over your heart I wrote over our life he said the world and the church are all of the same lump just like Jacob and Esau are the same parents but the Spirit of God makes the difference it doesn't matter if you call yourself a Christian anyone can do that the point is whether or not you have the Spirit of God in you for without that spirit you are reprobate and you are none of his amen you see they both had the same parents but the difference was the birth the difference was the birthright and the difference between you and the rest of the wall is your birth Oh hallelujah it's not just a feeling of a sanctification well you've been set aside for service and you feel a tingling of the Holy Ghost on your flesh and you say oh my god I got it when I felt that that rush just reached down and roll over the back of my neck oh I got I got it but you can't live one day right you ain't got it but all I let me tell you something if you get baptized by the baptism of the Holy Ghost on the inside of your soul you can say brother Santa I got it I got it you know what you got because the God are got you hallelujah and when Jacob was coming down to the meeting when he when he left Laban and he left everything that he knew here it is coming down to a spot when he's coming back to meet his brother Esau and Jacob is afraid he's coming back to his Spotty's he's disturbed he's perplexed he don't know what to do so he sets his wife's and his children and all of his all of his men servants on the other side of the brook and there Jacob goes on the other side of that brook and he goes to have himself a conference and he goes to an unexpected place the Prophet said in an unexpected time and he met God in an unexpected way and how did he meet God it was in a wrestling match now I don't know if he put if he put a knuckle shuffle on him or if he put a dive bomber on him or if he put him in a headlock but the angel got hold of him the angel got ahold of him in such a way that he wouldn't gonna let him go and Jacob got a hold of the angel and he said I'm not gonna let you go until you bless me now I don't care whether it's in a wrestling match and he's got you in a headlock and tells you and he starts rubbing your head get rid of your snake and thinking and start taking on my thinking oh I wish he'd grab a hold of some of your heads tonight grab hold of your children's life grab ahold of them produções life and put them in a headlock you're coming you're coming whether you like it or whether you don't because I chose you before the foundation of the world hallelujah I know one day he put me in a headlock I was running into every witch away from this altar from this God and one day God put me in a headlock and he changed my thinking over the heads thinking whew hello there he met God in a wrestling match but it was God that was a difference hallelujah no doubt Jacob had got himself in trouble a few times in his life he'd wrestled around no doubt with his brother I know you boys ain't never done nothing like it but you've got yourself wrestle around with people and different things he'd wrestled around he got himself in some trouble every once in a while but this time he got more than he bargained for but this time he didn't leave there all bloodied up and all messed up in the face but this time he walked away they're walking a little bit different he walked away a limp and Prince with power and the main thing was that Jacob he had dreams and he had visions and so forth but this one time had come and laid his hand on something to say it's God and he was able to hold on to it until the blessing came and ho if we could do that if we could find a spot to where God would see God we could see God whether it's in his word wherever it is and recognizes God and hold on to it until the blessing comes wrestle it out with God God promised to do it God said if we'd secret find ask his shall be given knock it shall be opened every words true and when Jacob got a hold of something that he could look at it hold - with his hands and seeing that that he was God he would not turn it loose who always Christendom could do that if you can lay your health your hand ahold of something that's real catch a vision of God see his presence and hold on to it until God since the answer back and the blessing letter of Ivor would break out here in Tulsa what about tonight in Elgin if you grab ahold something and you catch a vision and you know that you got a hold of something they ain't gonna let you go cuz it ain't you hope known anyway it's him holding on that angel ain't left us in 1965 that angels still standing here that angels still ministering that angels still speaking that angels still gathering in hallelujah this is an apostolic gauge and we know that God is still calling it and God is still bringing in and if God is still bringing in let's claim our loved ones let's claim our children let's claim healing let's claim deliverance if God still be God let him come forth o God to me your servant brother and a safety I was norther I will be but he is the I am that will not change he's with you on your job he's with you when you're sleeping he sees when you're awake hallelujah and he's got a good present for you and that is himself this old-fashioned Pentecostal experience I'm talking about tonight it'll change your life you can testify about her brothers and it'll change your life it'll change you think and it'll change your dress it'll change your wall it'll change your talk and that same Jesus is here to make the difference but you won't ever know or get the chance to know him unless he reveals himself to you oh but he's here than I he's here to move on your behalf tonight he's here to speak to you tonight oh I wonder if there's anybody wants to speak to him tonight he wants to talk to you but will you talk back to him hallelujah that same God that formed himself a body out of the calcium in the pod Hass in the dust of the earth and he took that dust of the earth and he blew of that dust and he stepped into that body that's the same God he wants to step into your children's body sister su he's wanting to take complete control over your life and show that he's God hallelujah it was not enough for him to show himself his dog through Jesus but now he is now walking through a body he's wanting to show himself as healer through a body he's wanting to show himself as a lover who a body he's wanting to show himself as a savior who a body I don't know about you but I like declaring that God still god I met him one time I met him one time and he got ahold of me and he never let go a little who you I remember that old man brother Vernon he's dead and stinking he's done in the grave done erotic many many years ago but every once in a while Oh slewfoot wants to raise him back up and say hey he's still here and all of a sudden the Holy Ghost says hey he ain't here no more I may look the same I may even walk the same but I do not live the same hallelujah because I was introduced to a God of her militance whoo hello it's the same God that was in a pillar fire that was same God in the whirlwind that's the same God in wrestling match Jesus said act that day you should know that I'm in the father and the father of me and I and you and you and me Church of the Living God your predestinated to win hallelujah he was of the first race he set this course in action but you are a church of a super race there's a whole lot of talk about racism kinds of different things going on in the world but there's a race setting here tonight that will never cease to exist when there is no more world the people of God the super race of God still will be it a black yellow green blue however color you want to be it's the god race whoo hallelujah it's this message that has brought us to a true Pentecostal experience brother BAM you remember when he said a parent he's after that morning and there was no Sun around there's no indifferent things and he saw those three rainbows as they were moving he said whatever it was it was living and it was three here are those three rainbows were standing there he said they were moving and the angel said that's close enough he said your home of the Old Testament it's Jesus Christ of the new and he was declaring that this was the message of him that is what William Branham preached to you and I that's what I'm preaching to you tonight it's the message of God whoo you see but I've I don't get you to a birth or if I don't get your children to a bar all this is is folklore all this is is history and all this isn't stories that's right anybody of your children pregnant sitting here long enough they could probably tell you about the 42-inch caribou they could tell you about the mountain they could tell you about how that grizzly bear wasn't showing up and Oh bud said hey brother it's about time that bears are showing up ain't it he said bud you're down you could probably quote that just like I just quoted that but if there is no birth on the inside of your soul all it is is a story but if you get what I'm talking about tonight when you die out to yourself it will be greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world I [Applause] know he's here I know he's real I know he's proven himself to be the same yesterday today and forever and if you don't get this baptism of the Holy Ghost you're going to disappoint yourself you'll let yourself down your tell yourself apart you'll say you're not going to make it and you won't make it cuz you ain't got it but get it one time get it one time you'll never he'll never disappoint you are you with me tonight if you are born again if you are born again you'll pull that God out of history and you'll show to a dying world that he's still living that he's still all-powerful that he's still omnipresent I've watched that god of deliverance firsthand Alleluia I seen him as weak I sent him this week to hallelujah but nine o'clock one night a certain individual from his church came stood on my porch and I watch the god of omnipotence show up and do the miraculous Wow it was odd wanted to show that he still god hallelujah now tonight if I tell you it's gonna be a death in this place some of y'all go running and screaming a holler all over this place get out the door said Oh God hope you talkin about me hope I am talking about some of you in your natural flesh of your spirit that you die out to yourself but if I would tell you that hey you're gonna die tonight whoa out of here she goes you're gonna go on the fly because you don't want to die it's something on the inside of a man but yet if I would tell you that on the other side of that death of the death of the old man that there is a new man standing there you'd run around this building shouting and screaming dancing all over this place if I tell you momma's and daddies that your children tonight there's going to be a death in here that the blood has been applied and the Death Angel has to pass over you go to screaming and shouting well you might as well go to scream in a shot God wouldn't put this hold me if I wasn't gonna be a death of an old man whoo hallelujah turn with me to galatians chapter 1 and three first quarter we're changing half's we're changing sides brother Jim brother Nathan you understand once a first quarter or changing sides somebody gotta say something you never get it that's okay I'll preach to those two get it let's just change directions just from home but great speak to you and peace from God the Father for my Lord Jesus Christ who gave himself for our sins that he might deliver us from this present evil world according to the will of God and a father to whom be glory for ever and every man a notice that word and verse for that he might deliver us from this present evil world now that word in the Greek exclusive it means to properly means to pluck out it means to tear out or it means to take out from a number or to select then to rescue or to deliver now that does not mean that he is plucking you out by the way of death it does not mean that he is removing you to another world but it means that he might rescue you from this present world I can tell you sometimes this present world that we live in down here in Laodicea I sure am happy for him to pluck me out of it and separate me from the things of the chaos of this world when you go to looking at the news and looking at Fox News and CNN and Facebook and everybody else this means that they've created and they're gifs that they created I can tell you ain't one of them good or ain't none of them put rapture rapture face down on the inside of my soul but I take a look over here at the one that delivers us from this present world I have to get a little bit happy and it makes my faith sore a little bit to think one of these things he's not just going to remove me or rescue me from here from Laodicea into a place of heavenly position but he's going to take me out of this whole world he's going to change this or more body body now notice what this this day the scripture is fulfilled he's brother Branham said now I might to stop here if I had time to give you just a little tip sometimes you you may be sitting out there with cancer you might be sitting out there with a disease you think well why me why me being a Christian wouldn't would be in this this away why would I be sitting like this if I'm a Christian you could be truthful you ain't gotta raise their hand but I'm sure there's some times in your life when you're going through things you said why me I'm supposed to be a Christian I died out to myself but all of these Saints keep adding to me that's pretty understandable question but notice what the Prophet says he said sometimes God lets things get so dark that you can't see up around or anywhere else and then he comes and makes a way through it for you that you might say this day this scripture is fulfilled that he promised there are times in your life when you think why nice in the promise that I was promised but God sometimes allows things to happen to show forth that he is the God of omnipotence God's not the one that makes you sick and God's not going to make you ever flat tire but God allows things to happen in your life to develop character in your life because it's not overcoming power if he puts you on the inside of the pipe and pushes you through it is that right but if you kick scream crow holler jump and shout and you overcome by the blood of the Lamb and the word of your testimony that's overcoming when I didn't see when it was coming I still believed it was coming when they didn't look or when it didn't feel or when I didn't feel the anointing I still held on to the promise I won't tell you Church the words on your side the word is on your side and the word will always be there and Elijah knew that the word was on his side and he knew where he was standing at and he knew that he could trust God you I lost his faith was not in the mantle his faith was in the God of Elijah and he stood there and he said will be that God will not jack I know this is a little bit of a challenge and it's a challenge to your faith but these things I'm presenting to you is to make your faith rise higher what kind of man of God would I be if I did not challenge your faith to reach out and touch the impossible it's not faith if you can just reach out there see it walk right into it and now all of it be done it said that's not faith you're just doing your doing you see it it's just like going to Walmart you go over and you see the Clorox stand and then you grab the Clorox but refrain no Clorox ey're you can say lord I need to clean my house then all of a sudden a worker comes up in a blue apron hey you look for some Clorox I'd say that you had touched somebody we're in the season of Clorox it's ok you understand now notice he said now no notice but listen there is where faith takes its resting place for it knows for it knows that God will never never let the enemy right over the top of him I notice this whole walk of you with Christ is not about you you're not the big guy in the picture let me bring it down a little bit closer and look past what you're seeing it's not about brother on I don't take yourself a big cup grab ahold of it swallow it down it's good it'll help you this fight is not about brother on this is God's fight oh if you could ever realize hurts if you can look past this flesh look past what you see Oh that's what Hale is trying to keep you from Full Gospel Light House this ain't about Full Gospel Light House this ain't about brother on this is about God getting the glory and what will God do he will get just that but you get so attached it's easy it's my dad it's my pastor oh yeah it's easy but you gotta look past you got a little past now I know but there's a door on the other side of that bush I know that but sometimes you gotta walk around on the other side of that bush are you with me on the other side of that burning bush was that God speaking to Moses are you with me and if you could realize that more than Ron Spencer more than Connie Spencer more than grab more than my grandpa more than your family more than your sitting here tonight hallelujah you're an eternal being with God you can never die but God is going to take these 16 elements that you love so much you cherish so much and God is going to come out it's going to take this red hit it 5-foot used to be ten now nine slowly going down my time I may get to it I may be son's brother Ron hope not I had to knock off about four or five inches off my ankles but God is going to take this 16 elements now you don't matter if it's red hair blue hair I pray God never gives me blue hair if I have I then been sprayed with some of that pharmacy oil that you spray on your animals and I gotten got some awful disease but God don't care whether it's red hair black hair blonde hair whatever tear color hair no hair are you with me he's going to take these 16 elements and he's going to bring about a victory for him who sat with me it ain't about you tell your neighbor you can't shake the hands you can't slap them but look at your neighbor and say it ain't about you it's about him if you got blue hair tonight you come up here we'll talk to your pharmacist we'll figure out what's going on we're not gonna get nowhere now this is what help me Lord this is where let me start all over this is where faith takes its resting place for it knows that God would never let the enemy ride over top of him he never has faith knows that so regardless of what the thing looked no one knew that the ark could float Daniel knew that God could close the Mawlid lion's mouth the Hebrew children knew that God could stop the fire and jesus knew that God would raise him up again because the Lord said I'll not leave his soul in Hell neither will I suffer my Holy One to see corruption are you with me and I know how about you brother Jordan that it's not going to be about you but God is going to raise up your body are you with me I know what he said about this body I'm not talking about this body I'm talking about the body of Christ that is going to rise above creats rise above denominations rise above doubts rise above sin rise above the grave rise above your fears hallelujah lots of the war who had the double portion he stood down there said where is the god of Elijah and let the God that wrote the word confirm the word if this is his word let him stand by he promised to do it he'll do it if we'll believe it I can tell you most of you sitting here are mature Christians been sitting here probably got their agrees in this message and you know that prayer changes things but prayer seems to be the thing that slacks the most in most people's life we can be honest dumbest some of you go to prayer and you go to praying at night I'm explaining human life right now but you go to pray in the night time and all of a sudden all of a sudden I heaviness comes over top of you and you're laying before the Lord has closed and you're knocked out prayers sure they changed some things you went from a wake to sleep in 0.02 seconds but we realized that prayer is the most powerful weapon that is ever placed in the hands of you and I now it is not the length of the prayer it is not how deep you go in your voice or how high you go in your voice but when it comes from the heart that's when all of a sudden God goes - moving on the scene and all of a sudden the omnipotent God that you thought was so far away all of a sudden comes down in your car and all of a sudden you watch things start taking place in your life because of the communication between you and the divine being of God you have grabbed ahold of a line and it's like you're pulling guard down to you but what it is it's God pulling you up to him prayer does not bring God down to you but it takes you to his level and when you are in that spirit of prayer I'm not just talking about when you start praying and asking God to bless the parakeet's and bless your little little lamb out there bless your chickens and give you more than seven eggs a day I'm talking about when you go into the spirit of prayer and you start having a breakthrough and all of a sudden everything around you begins to get life and ever all the one of your burdens seem to just shield off for you you're standing there and the Prophet said that when you drew it truly and really pray through everything around you I wonder if we hit that spot this week it's okay you can have that spot if you ain't had it in a while I want to tell you can have it you can get in such a spirit of Prayer and the atmosphere change your family changes your attitude changes your job changes your boss changes your needs change you go from praying about yourself to praying about your brother praying about the preacher praying about this and God starts taking those things now if we could bottle up the things that we prayed for God comes over and he feels it up with his life and you watch you go pray for one of your lost loved ones and I mean full out pray and it don't look like they're coming whatsoever and all of a sudden just God goes to doing something because you prayed do you know the half of this church is filled up because of prayer I'm talking about our full congregation right now that most of you that are here are here by the way a prayer Dwight Moody said that every great move of God you can look behind it and you see a kneeling figure what is it it is prayer that brings God on the scene I walked out Monday morning after preaching to you for the last cup of services are introducing a God of our militants I walked out in such an atmosphere in my home and God just seemed to speak to my heart invoke me invoke me invoke of the God of omnipotence if you could realize who me who's on the other side of the line it is not the China ambassador but it's the creator of heaven and earth and if you would go to invoking and appealing to the higher authority what would take place are you with me you remember Loa Jemima down there down there in a spot that that nobody wanted to go to when there was down there in the Sandy's and she had prayed a prayer of faith and there was a 747 that was flying over the atmosphere and inside of that 747 was the answer but all of a sudden it disrupted everybody's plans on the rest of that plane but it brought the god of Elijah on the scene for her oh and about four o'clock in the morning Haeju mommy was woke up by a dream that there was a man coming had a brown suit on and a brown hat on and she seen that it had a briefcase and here brother madam come walking down that Street singing that old Pentecostal song I'm one of them I'm one of them well I'm so glad that I could say I'm one of them and he's going down through here and it looks over said morning morning and she says morning parson how'd you know I suppose she said eyes have been up early in the morning I've been up early this morning and the Lord told me use coming the only thing I don't recognize about you is where's your briefcase she said he said it's back in the hotel he recognized that she'd been talking to the omnipotent God she said you ever read about that Sunnah my woman I'll be like that shooter my woman but where be my Elisha my brother Joseph Lee pointed this out to me years ago now she couldn't afraid that prayer 200 years ago but she was praying it in the right day because there was an Elijah that could come on the scene for the Shuler my woman and we know what took place what was it it was the power of prayer now that's some faith that'll stop a 747 what about if you would go to prayer like never before this woman's prayer disrupted everybody else's plans what if you go to pray what if you don't appeal into the higher authority and invoking the God of heaven it would disrupt the devil's plans he's got plans to kill you but if you've got to call it on God God will show up Alleluia what am I telling you about the God that is on your side what's too hard for this God what's too little okay because every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord every headaches got about the biggest demon inhales got a bath Satan himself is gallabat Bala lujah your prada khals will have two baths Oh hallelujah hallelujah but the musicians come Fallon oh whoa what would happen in huh what would happen enough you would break through if you would break through sad just what God's will for my life that's what I want that's what every Christian wants that's what you wanted to average out of gods as Harris for the will of God he has lined out every one of his promises for you I am the lord that heals all of your diseases the days of miracles are not past children the days of promises are not past for somebody to say that it's not God's will to heal that it's not God's will to perform here of course that it's not God's will to save what are they doing they're changing the God of the Bible but my prophet said my prophet messenger stood here and thoroughly vindicated that the god of omnipotence he's here he's right here he's right here now we know that that world spinning faster than this one and we can't really see what's going on in that world brother ray but we know that it's there is that right we know that there's angels that are gathered here tonight sister Karli better they're there to watch over us that are there to take care of us you don't see them but yet there are angels that are here and moving and moving the body but it's got to come through the body that germ that God is trying to get to you has got to come through the body but those angels are here and also their fallen angels that are here and you walked brother BAM could look into that world and he could see those things and he would you could hear him on tape say now now he tell these sayings that he'd seen now there was a dark spirit that came and got that man and took him to the restroom and he missed his door of opportunity what was it it was a fallen angel that was directing what he wanted to make a claim on the body now if that world has that much power to influence this fleshly Ram what about the God that is on my side hello if he's got that much power he could control these 16 elements it's not God's will for you to be sick and it's not God's will for you to think bad thoughts but he is the God of omnipotence that wants to take control over your body your spirit and your soul let's stand Oh Helen Oh aw let's pray children father we've we come tonight we come tonight calling on the name of Jesus we realize that that there is no power in heaven and earth given among men whereby they must be saved but by the way of Jesus we realize if that power is ever present here moving and changing lives by the word of prophecy the anointing of this hour as it goes out and gets the steward cause him to come up a little bit higher now Lord I've watched you tonight as you begin to deal with farts and begin to move on certain needs and I'm aware of God I can hide I can try to look at things and trial to try to make a idea or a good stance to understand how you do things through service but when you come and totally rearrange and change thoughts to go after one need I realize that I realize that you're after chilli and the words of PMS is more than a man's words but the words of them is to look past what they see look past what they feel for Jesus your ever praise me more Jesus and these things that ever been presented to us they're not history but here you're right here right now father and you're declaring that your God your God over the airwaves your God your God it's who you are your father I free that you speak to your children just I believe you've already spoke to them but I pray God that you see the desire that they're releasing from their heart to Stan I pray Lord Jesus that you take complete control and that you adorn yourself pour yourself into that situation or to me was to invoke the part of omnipotence the father I watched you this week do it only you can do so I'm a living
