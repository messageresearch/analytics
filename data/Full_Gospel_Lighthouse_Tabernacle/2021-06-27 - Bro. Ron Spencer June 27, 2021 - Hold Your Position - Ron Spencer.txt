the lord to bless you amen you can be seated after you've given god bless you either whatever song you would like to sing says charity is fine amen while she's looking for the words i just want to testify a little bit about what happened last night because i believe out of the mouth of two or three there will be a witness and um i also just want to if it's all right with ron i want to go ahead and call that devil out in the street this morning amen because the ones he believes he's got the grips around he doesn't have he doesn't have a strand to hold on and just as i told you last night it's time to stand and fight and i've been standing i've been fighting for my family and this is one standing right here and last night during service i looked and i looked over at her and i could tell i could tell god was god was working god was god was speaking directly to her through that service and i'm sure there's more that's standing here that god was speaking directly to and as we went as we went to the house we usually go out to eat we ended up we all went back to ronald connie's and we were all just speaking about the service and talking about it and i began to take i was taking sarah back and um i knocking came on my window and i was like good lord what malachi was calling me we're driving down the driveway i said what do you want boyle come back he said he said you need to come in here something's going on he said okay so i backed up i wasn't sure exactly what was going on as soon as i walked into the house i could i could tell that there was a there was that atmosphere in there that that something something really powerful was was happening um i saw ron he was he was speaking to charity and um she was in tears and i could tell that god was really speaking and moving on her life and so we all we all gathered hands and we went there in the living room and we circled around circled around ron and circled around charities he grabbed her by the shoulders and as we all bowed our heads to pray as you could just tell that there was something different we could tell that god was coming down and as i was praying as i had my eyes shut his mind was shut the entire time and as i was praying there was a light that just came down and with my eyes shut i could see the light literally coming down from coming down from from heaven and as it was coming down as i could just tell and it was right one right when ron was speaking as even as that angel standing here now and i just held on to that close because i'm very sensitive when trying to see those things if i see something i just want to make sure that it's god and it's not just a light or something like that was i was taking taking sarah back after that um i was i was we were talking about service and i was actually speaking about service and she kind of spoke up and she goes you talk about the light i was like no i didn't see light i was like where are you talking about it at ron's and she said yeah wow while we were praying it just she said i thought my the light hit my glasses because it just got really bright in the room and uh she said it was right when he said the angel's standing ever close now and right then it was a vindication and and it was like that's what i saw i just i really wanted to hold it close well then this morning as we were sitting at the breakfast table and i was we were just reminiscing on how great god is and what happened is as i said that malachi spoke up and we all gathered together and they said they said the same thing as they saw that they saw that light in the middle of prayers and lit the room up and i just know and i just thank god over so much and i just want to say if the prodigals are coming home and andrew spoke on that last night the prodigals are coming home wherever they may be at they're coming home and you can see myself included malachi charity my and my other brother they're all coming home well i'm going to walk right out of this valley with my hands and praise the lord said i ain't gonna let all satan get me down down down why should i sit here till i die heaven's waiting just a little bit higher i'm gonna walk right out this valley with my lord [Music] sit down here and cry [Music] travel to that city [Music] where the sun is [Music] oh satan get me down down down why should i sit here till i die heaven's swaying just a little bit higher i'm gonna walk right out this valley with my lord you [Music] i remember how you told me [Music] you've already given me i remember how you told me i can trust you completely [Music] so why am i doubting when you prove that you'd fight for me you walked me through fire [Music] i won't be afraid [Music] i can barely breathe [Music] changed by your mercy [Music] i'm living out the victory doesn't mean you've walked me through fires hold me from place if [Music] and higher and it feels like i can barely breathe walk through these fires i can't face anything cause you're here with me i can do all things cause your strength in me i remember how he showed me the price of my redemption but how could i question when you prove that you die for me you've walked me through fires and pulled me from flames if you're in this with me i won't be [Music] and afraid and it feels like i can barely breathe walk through these fires cause you're walking with me i'll walk through these fires cause you're walking with me hallelujah we can go through all things knowing he's right there with us amen what a powerful powerful song amen i i remember when sister charity was singing that song i had come back to my memory my martini used to sing that song and she could just she could just play that piano you know at old pentecostal style and phil felt like the keys were about to come off the board you know and she could play that thing and i remember one time she got to play in that thing and jumped off off that up that seat started shouting she didn't she didn't she didn't she sure enjoyed her religion she and sure enjoyed it and i sure enjoyed mine i sure enjoy what he's done for us and i think that that dimension's ever getting so close that we can see them we can feel them and they're moving amongst us in one of these mornings they're going to step out and we're going to invite them on in and we're going to we're going to talk about the good things of god i was thinking i'm just thinking brother william i might be telling stories out of school here but brother william i was had related to us one time about when his when his father was on was on like a facetime or a skype and he was with some believers on in romania and they were there and they testified his mother had done passed away and they testified that they had seen her standing behind brother william's dad and you know and they'd seen her standing right there i believe that's correct that dimension's real close that dimension is really really close and if you could just be aware this morning that the mighty god is is ever so close and he's coming to meet his children and his brother ron would get ready to come and make his way this morning to bring forth the word of life maybe we sing that song mighty you are would you stand with us this morning lord god almighty you are clothed with manchester the heavens declare your wonders for you are great and do marvelously for you alone our god there is no one else like you let the nations declare that you have done greatly you have done great things almighty you are o holy who are your mercy endureth forever more righteous

just a moment so glad to see you this morning amen we just believe this will be a really bad day for the devil amen amen as you've already heard we had a very supernatural night last night amen whenever he comes it's always great isn't it and it's just in a moment you're just not expecting and just then he just comes and hey that changes lives forever changes generations and so we're just so thankful to have charity and malachi and we're always glad to have gabriel here with us and so amen we're just so honored and we called dad this morning to share that news with him and he was so thrilled about that as well and so his oldest brother is being buried today and he was a church of god bishop for many many years and a church of god a prophecy bishop for many many years and toward the latter end of his life to when he was still mobile and he used to come to dad's church and they'd pick him up every night and he would come to the church sit and listen to the word and he sure enjoyed the word the message and so we just we know that he has went to his reward and uh probably i should have been there at the funeral but i'd rather be here and so i just chose to be here so hope you don't hold that against me this morning that i didn't go to my uncle's funeral i loved him and cared for him but i'd rather be preaching to the living amen those things have their places and and maybe i should have been there maybe after the service over the devil will think i should have been there did you catch that [Laughter] amen but since i'm preaching on position this morning this is my position amen amen and position is authority and so uh here we are amen we're so glad to see you in the house of the lord brother ray i expected you to be in bed you know he was all night last night

to stand there hallelujah jeremiah chapter 1 and verse 5. before i formed thee in the belly i knew thee that's so powerful that's one of the most powerful scriptures i know of and before thou camest out of the womb i sanctified thee and i ordained thee a prophet unto the nations genesis chapter 17 and verse 1. and when abram was 90 and 9 the lord appeared to abram and said unto him i am the almighty god walk before me and be thou perfect and i will make my covenant between me and thee and will multiply thee exceedingly and abram fell on his face and taught and god talked with him saying as for me behold my covenant is with thee and thou shalt be a father of many nations neither shall thy name any more be called abram but thy name shall be abraham for a father of many nations have i made thee and i will make thee exceedingly fruitful and i will make nations of thee and kings shall come out of thee and we can say and god did it you can be seated this morning may the lord bless the reading of his word this morning i would like to speak to you and this has been on my heart for for some time now on hold your position hallelujah now position is authority you understand that as a believer as a believer of this word you have more authority than the angels that are in heaven that's quite a statement it's quite a very active statement now god has predestinated you to live in this age as we heard last night not to survive but to overcome and overcome means to prevail you're going to wrestle you're going to be in the darkness but you're going to wrestle you were built for this age you're the final infantry if it might be said you're the final group to fight against laodicea and this is satan's last opportunity to destroy the gift of god that he's placed on the earth but i want to the to just raise our flag one more time and make a declaration on this hill there's outposts all across the world in every nation there are believers where there are 10 people or 5 000 people we are believers and we hold our position well we refuse to give up we refuse to turn back we may be in this world but we're not of this world the world is headed toward tribulation period it's not going to get better [Music] but while we are here we are the salt of the earth we are the light in the darkness of this age we heard this last week and i thought this would go quite well with this morning to the people in of texas in february the 24th of 1836 all americans in the world and fellow citizens can and compatriots i am persua i am besieged by a thousand or more of the mexicans under santa ana and i have sustained amen a continual bombardment and can and aid for 24 hours and have not lost a man the enemy has demanded a surrender at discretion otherwise the garrison are to be put to the sword if the fort is taken i have answered the demand with a cannon shot and our flag still waves proudly over all from all walls i shall never surrender or retreat lieutenant colonel william barrett travis p.s the lord is on our side hallelujah so let us make our declaration standing here in the darkness of laodicea our flag of victory still stands we will never bend and we will never bow down we will never turn or retreat the lord is on our side hallelujah whether you're in belgium or whether you're in switzerland or wherever you're at in the earth today whether you're in ireland with a little group of people raise your flag proudly hallelujah you were built to live in this age we shall overcome in china today they have taken away all the internet access of the message of the hour they are trying to shut down the churches even now they've taken away their bibles they've taken away their internet they've taken away their message too late the message is already deposited they're still standing they're still holding strong hallelujah amen brother braham said he said he might have been a man a man crying this is jesus but but when he called that man out of the grave that man that had been dead for four days and he sold four days journey somewhere i don't know where it was at neither do you so anyhow he called him back corruption knew its master soul knew its creator and a man that had been dead stood on his feet and lived again after dead after being dead four days that was more than a man that was god it was a man that when he came down off of the mountain that night and was hungry and looked all around over a fig tree to find something to eat he was a man when he was hungry but when he taken five biscuits and two fish and fed five thousand that was more than a man he was a man that he was laying out there in the back of a boat that night where ten thousand devils of the sea swore that they would drown him and a little low boat in that storm like a bottle stopper out there somewhere floating up and down like that he was a man when he was asleep he was tired virtue had went out of him but when he put his foot on the brow that boat and looked up and said peace be sealed and the winds and waves obeyed him that was more than a man that was god in christ reconciling the world to himself he was a man when he died on the cross crying for mercy that's right but he was god on easter morning when he broke the seal was in the tomb and rose up and ascended on high ever living to make intercessions every man and woman that ever amount to a heal of beings believes that he is the same yesterday today and forever believeth thou this he is just as great right here among us tonight as he was then believeth thou this [Music] he's the same healer tonight he watched them believeth thou this sure he can't fail be persistent hold your position in christ your confession hold your confession in christ we read the scripture of god making a covenant with abraham god asked him to count the the dust of the sand he said no man can count that so shall thy seed be god asked him to look toward the heaven said can you count the stars you remember the stars were laid out that's the first bible and every star has a position great and small every star has a position and it holds its position tonight or the whole thing would get out of order are you with me now that's god's great bible never has to be rewritten it was laid out there then enoch built the pyramid and that was god's bible on the earth can you count the stars abraham he was standing there childless and that's telling him if you can see the future you're not alone amen you're not alone in this battle i want to say this to you sometimes you feel like you're all alone and sometimes you must stand alone are you with me now you must stand alone and hold your conviction and hold your confession in the face of death or in the face of unbelief cause god ordained you to hold strong are you with me now week we've watched a building collapse a building collapsed about 150 people is missing they declared this morning they don't know they've just found a few but they're digging tirelessly and thank god for that and i actually pray that god would help them two years ago in 2018 there was an engineer that went under that building and looked at all the substructure and he warned them that this building is deteriorating the sea water that is coming in from the ground is deteriorating the concrete and the steel something must be done the warning was sent out i want to read you another warning come on 1965 brother brahm said this is a solemn warning we don't know what time you don't know what time that this city one day is going to be laying out here in the bottom of this ocean oh capernaum said jesus thou who exalted in the heavens will be brought down into hell for if the mighty works that were done in sodom and gomorrah it would be been it would still be it would have been standing to this day and sodom and gomorrah lays in the bottom of the dead sea and capernaum is in the bottom of the sea thou city that who claims to be the city of angels who has exalted her yourself into heaven and sent all all the dirty filthy things of fashions and things till even foreign countries come here to pick up our filth and send it away to your fine churches and steeples and so forth the way you do remember one day you'll be laying at the bottom of the sea your great honeycomb under you right now the wrath of god is belching right beneath you how much longer he will hold the sandbar hanging out over that when that ocean out yonder a mild deep will slide in there pump back to the salton sea it'll be worse than the last day of pompeii repent los angeles repent the rest of you and turn to god the hour of his wrath is upon the earth flee while there's time to flee and coming to christ god sent an engineer and he gave him a solemn warning we're talking we're not talking about one building we're talking about an entire city [Applause] everything that's under sea level the ocean in charlottesville come on the ocean over top of florida the ocean over top of the caribbean the ocean over top of of england you see god's not a weather forecaster and hits 17 so many times people live in sin thinking i'm going to always get by with it brother homer brother homer always made this statement he said your sins will find you out it's like a great a man came under a he came and he lived in a very beautiful spot there was a huge slab of a mountain that was just above his head but down beneath hundreds and hundreds of feet below maybe even a thousand feet below what's the most beautiful majestic place kind of a valley to live in people would come through and tell his family don't you know that that mountain one day is going to give way and it's going to fall they ignored the warning they got comfortable where they lived at it became a wonderful city for the people to live because one plus one equals two and after a while you've got hundreds of descendants and other people come to join you but yet the rock remained history tells us about a hundred years later that place was demolished because there was a warning came and they lived under the rock of sin and it destroyed the city i think about how our thoughts are today we think life will always be the same way life will always continue the way that it is but let me just say this to you we've had a message to get us ready brother branham would stand in pulpit after pulpit declaring the message of the hour and the work is going to happen i want to just make a few things very clear this morning this message has done exactly what it said it would do you don't have to question if it's right or it's not right you don't have to argue about the quotes and what you like and what you don't like you know this message is more than legalism it's more than men preaching god has got men all over the earth that refused to give up refused to back up this message goes from generation to generation it's the same life that was in a prophet of god passed right now because it wasn't the personality of william branham that we attached to it was the person of jesus christ this message is jesus living are you with me now and the same thing that happened last night in our living room it's the same jesus that my mother met as a methodist girl are you with me [Music] hallelujah listen this is more than a family thing more than a family thing what gathered you here come on church what gathered you here what gathered your loved ones here decades ago and this church continues to stand i had a president of the bank look across the desk and said you whether you know it or not you're one of the strongest churches in this entire valley and i said it's not me i might be the chief financial officer but i i i am under the orders of jesus christ himself hallelujah this church wasn't built by man it was built by god [Applause] [Music] amen hallelujah a man asked me in the business world here not long ago said how many boards do you have in your church i said we have none we don't have a board here you don't have a board in your church i said no not a one i said we got trustees we got deacons and we got preachers in ministry but none of them are boards jesus is the ruler here at this church [Applause] hallelujah amen amen that may rub people gawd them just a little bit people love to vote they love to vote they love to have politics in church politics is of the devil [Applause] so don't get your eyes too much on washington it's of the devil good people go to washington and become corrupted that's not news don't get shook there that's not news [Applause] that's not news abraham lincoln was one of the most incredible presidents that we ever had but the railroad put abraham lincoln in washington ain't that right am i right that's what he did that's what they did whoo cut your politics you get nervous god has men he actually causes men to rise and fall he actually causes them to rise and fall you say even presidents sure he has precedence to put to move things from israel and move them right over to the right place the other day netanyahu was moved out of his position i told sister connie i said god did that god did that i don't understand the pieces of how it all comes together but the world is headed toward tribulation period and netanyahu could not be there because he stands like a prophet over top of israel and every nation will turn against israel one of these days but do you think that israel will bend or bow every day every day israel has to hold its position are you with me they send bombs over in on them they retaliate i think that's the way a christians ought to be when the devil sends a bomb to your house you don't have to stand there and surrender to that enemy you can send the word of god right against him because you're taught to hold your position [Applause] hallelujah i've laid my foundation now let's do some whooping on the devil for a little while yeah philippians chapter 1 and verse 6 being confident of this very very thing that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of jesus christ romans chapter 4 and verse 17 as it is written i have made thee a father of many nations this is the new testament through the blood before him whom he believed even god who quickeneth the dead and recalleth those things which be not as though they were who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about a hundred years old neither the deadness of sarah's womb he staggered not just when your case looked so bleak he staggered not [Applause] at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to god and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform brother braham says this in the great warrior david he said one looks at it one way and one looks at it from from from the wisdom sense the other looks at it from a spiritual sense so it's just whichever way you base your faith if the doctor says it's finished and you believe that that settles it but if the doctor says it's finished and you don't believe it because god said something different watch what happens just depends on which way you let yourself go who you yield your members to that's whose servant you are he said you get along a lot better with your doctor but the doctor isn't your healer got your healer that's right your doctor only is his assistant to god he's only an assistant to god that's right but when the doctor's gone as far as he can go that's his limit and he can only work on what he sees and what he can feel that's all he knows but god controls the rest brother it happened to fall on the wrong ear that morning for him goliath there was a little fella standing out there that knowed where he was at what we need tonight is somebody else who knows where they're at what we need tonight is men and women who knows their position in jesus christ and when the devil makes his great boast sure he makes this great boast he's still making his most he's still got goliaths and we've still got some david's too thanks be to god for that he makes his big boast it fell on the ears of the wrong fella and that little fellow walking around there he had to look up to see he's a man like that but he knew that he was elected by god and he was anointed come on church god elected you god predestinated you not some feeble man not some fickle man but god predestinated you [Applause] brother anna sometimes i just feel like quitting tracked if you can you're not none of his if you can walk away [Music] [Applause] if you can walk away it just proves what's inside of you [Applause] i may take a herald for the devil but that's the truth anyway because for a real believer there's no walking away for him oh we're not doing this by our emotions we're not doing this by our feelings we're not doing this because somebody's applauding us we're doing this because we're anchored in the word of god and let hill reach let every demon come against you god's for me who can be against me i've had a very public very visible fight over the last year year and a half now time passes real quick sister connie and i have been married 38 years we just went away for a couple of days enjoyed our time away and god bless sister connie she'll stand by me throughout the eternities amen as a trophy on my arm thank god for giving me sister connie [Applause] i'm getting ready to celebrate 21 years here is your pastor i preached since 1984 but i've never changed hopefully i'm a better speaker today than i was in 1984 but i believe this message like the dream when i was standing with the prophet of god and he had a book in his hand the way of a true prophet and asked me if i'd like to have it so i've carried this this this in my my my bible ever since the dream and i stood there before brother branham in the dream and i told him i said i preach this message with all my heart and believe it with everything that is within me and he patted me on the cheek and he said ron you're going to get well must understand in the layers of the battle of cancer when i was attacked obviously satan sent his best because it would go into the it would go into the from my eye is what they're saying now from my eye into my lymph nodes then into my lungs and then into my brain removing one of the tumors from the brain and then using uh gamma-ray to to try to destroy the rest of the tumors in my brain sometimes you go to the doctor and get good reports sometimes it's mixed results sometimes it gives you difficult thoughts the other day i got the doctor she's an incredible doctor she she just gave me some difficult news about how my lungs were were filled with inflammation and and maybe some aggression that's getting ready to go on a few weeks ago i was awakened in the middle of the night in the and i heard the voice saying the storm is coming a storm is coming sure god sometimes brings you good news sometimes he brings you news to let you know things are happening when i heard the doctor as she began to give she was just looking at what she saw but i'm looking at what i see i'm looking at what i see and i just simply told her sister connie's here to vouch for that i just simply told her you can't give me any more chemo that's right it's the highest notes that's right i said well if it's more cancer it's more cancer but god's still god now i'm not some wimpy little christian that you have to baby around are you with me i'm not going by my feelings whether i have a good day or a bad day sister connie and i went on our on our honeymoon 38th and i was up walking the floor to one and two o'clock in the morning because my body was hurting so bad did that make me want to walk to the pulpit this morning and give you a pity party i walked to the pulpit this morning looking the devil right square in the eye and reminding him i'm holding my position [Applause] and i want to encourage you no matter what fight that you're in no matter where you're at in your life hold your position that's what we do brother johnny hallelujah so based on that i'm going to i'm going to deliver some blows here if it's okay i want to get some cannon fire isaiah 54 behold i have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire that bringeth forth an instrument for his work i have created the waster to destroy no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against thee and the judgment thou shalt condemn this is the heritage of the servants of the lord and their righteousness of me saith the lord this is a quote that brother random would quote over and over again all powers in heaven and earth is given into my hand go and i'll go with you i'll be with you whatever you bind on earth i'll bond in heaven whenever you loose on earth i'll loosen heaven who's going to do that through the power of your tongue last week we witnessed we literally witnessed god in action with timothy standing out on the stage and he is preaching and he said several key statements and all of a sudden his ipad which is sitting back here actually the app actually comes up and goes to a certain message and begins to play we were not in control of that god's in control of that last night we had an incredible service to me it was andrew's finest sermon i've ever heard him preach and then we went home and in our living room the pillar of fire becomes visible as a young lady gets a new birth to never be the same what we are witnessing here is jesus among us and in the darkness of laodicea he has not given up his position [Applause] now i must admit i'm not pointing out anybody but there's people that can sit on these pews it's just another service we'll see rose be open when we get out somebody had a different dress on her somebody had shoes on her you know so and so wasn't here or this just another time we're just here and god can do these things and not move us i would get to an altar as fast as i could in hebrews chapter 11 it's going to call some names names like noah enoch abel abraham moses i'm not going to call them all each of them lived in a generation they were put in position to stand and we know their names today and they fall off of our lips so incredibly quick but in third day many of them had to stand alone and they held their position the book of acts will continue to be written our names will be written in the book of acts brother brown said if given time they could write another book of acts behind this bribe and somewhere ronald dean spencer will be written your name will be written amen are you with me your name will be written it may not be in the who's who but i want my name written in god's book as an overcomer of this age hebrews chapter 12 which is one of my favorite scripture wherefore see and we're so cast about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which just so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us don't waste your next 24 hours your next week your next month your next year on things that are extremely temporary put everything you can all of your energies towards serving god like never before notice the scripture looking to jesus because there's no other place to look to looking unto jesus the author and the finisher of our faith who for the joy was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of god i want to share this scripture with you or this quote with you god's purpose can never be defeated that makes me feel like running around this building i want you to say this with me god's purpose can never be defeated [Music] god's purpose can never be defeated why don't you just go ahead and say it to yourself god's purpose can never be defeated now i want you to understand now god the devil can't take you off of the earth until your purpose is finished here on the earth i keep reminding the devil no matter how bad the doctors report god still got purpose in my life what about your life the neighbor that you will witness to the person that you'll go to school with how do i witness your life your life sounds louder than your words do let the life of god so live inside of you that create an atmosphere around you until your life is so resoundingly great life john wesley preached 42 000 sermons an average of three hours apiece wrote on horseback for the most of it fields streets churches it didn't matter he preached until he was 88 years old william carey brother branham speaks of him translated the bible into 44 different languages peter cartwright that brother branham speaks so much of goes into a town and the bully tells him you're not going to have a service here he held his position and he said you're gonna have to whip me first and he said well that's the next thing i'll do climb down off the ladder roll these sleeves up took his coat off and whipped the town bully right there come on church he's from this area we're fighters it's in our blood he preached right here across the mountain there's a marker on route six of peter cartwright held a meeting let me just say this year stonewall jackson wasn't the only fighter from this area [Applause] hallelujah let us be like c.l lewis he said may satan celebrate the day that i die thirty men walked into peter cartwright's meeting and nobody would confront these men they were going to destroy the meeting and peter cartwright single-handedly with 30 men you say well that's absolutely impossible you don't understand in our family there was a man that picked up a dry jawbone of an ass and he picked it up and he killed over a thousand soldiers how did he do it one at a time one at a time you whip your devil one at a time one at a time now you see the devil's very resilient he'll show back up tomorrow whip him again he'll show back the next day whip him again he's going to do his job you might as well do yours you might as well go ahead and pull your sword and give him a good old-fashioned weapon hold your position hold it stand your ground it's more than a good law in florida stand your ground as a christian you need to stand your ground god bless you gabriel he's going to stand the ground for virginia state police officers sometimes we act like we're a bunch of wimpy christians i'm just going to i'm delivering my heart today we act like we're defenseless and we just can't do nothing that devil just keeps beating me and he beats me and he beats me well you're not doing your job you're just being lazy he just beats me beats me and beats me let me just say this to you sister hoover laid in a nursing home for over nine years in a horrible condition she didn't give up it might have looked like a horrible battle but she laid there almost as an invalid but she raised her banner every day that she was a christian and this was a place that she went to church and at her funeral i don't know how many of the people that was from that nursing home came to this place and heard the gospel preached and her doctor said she lived the life in a nursing home your surroundings your circumstances you may not be able to control but god's greater than your circumstances hallelujah buddy robinson we've actually preached in the pulpit where buddy robinson preached brother brahm talks about him he needed god maybe you need god maybe you're in a spot in your life to worthy you can't go a step forward and you need a real god maybe you've sat on a pew for years and pretended to part hollywood is not hollywood is not the only place that has actors there's a lot of actors sitting church i'm not looking up not looking for your expression and they act apart and when satan comes to tempt them they fall apart but if you've got the real goods you actually shine under your trial did you get that you actually shine under your trough every hypocrite can shout and praise the lord when all the bills are paid and your health is great and your family is in wonderful shape but let the devil come to tempt you and shake you a little bit let him shake you to prove you've got the goods it's then under your trial that you confess faith like never before it's then that you pull your sword it's worthless to pull your sword when there's no enemy around but when you've got ten thousand demons coming against you pour your sword you can't lose [Applause] brother brandon said have faith in god oh my how the devil has to recognize the supreme authority of jesus christ not me he hates me he don't have to mind me but he has to mind who i represent he has the mind who sent me here another quote satan you who have bound these people you're exposed to not your grips are lost you have no legal authority at all jesus christ robbed you and stripped you at calvary and we come as a church of the living god in the name of jesus christ i endure you to leave every person in the building come out of the people thou demons i enjoy thee i jury thee by the living god [Applause] that's the way the enemy will do if he can see that he's got an upper hand he'll always proposition you but when he's in the corner he's a coward for the devil is defeated won't you say that with me for the devil is defeated for the devil is defeated for the devil is defeated for the devil is defeated i want you to quote that this week for the devil is defeated amen you ever read the news and you almost are depressed before you get to the bottom line i'm a headline reader and it's just bad news all the way down just bad news people murdered people raped rights in the street just going on and on and on and on and i don't have to tell you you know what you know you still keep it do you quit reading it you just go back to tomorrow and you read the same thing over and over again well let me just tell you this if you will turn and read the word of god [Music] and you read and read and read down through its lines and you start putting it on your lips i don't care what your circumstances look like i got some good news for you just keep quoting it greater is he that is in me than he that's in the world if you abide in me and my words abide in you ask what you will and it shall be done unto you by his stripes i am healed hallelujah unmovable unshakable can you give me just a couple more minutes god always has somebody that's not scared don't worry you run i'll still be standing somebody left the church and gave me a mouthful one day and i said don't you wear it i'll still be standing here you come back

lawrence said that he would drive up and down the road and every time he drove up and down the road on his delivery van he'd look up at this place and conviction would still strike him listen if god didn't put that seed on the inside of him he could have drove by this lack of hundreds of thousands of other people and never move them but because he was a sea [Applause] brother on will my prodigals ever come home god knows it's all in the hands of god it's all in the hands of god i didn't know where launch science was in his life but here he came back to church he's been anchored amen because the seed of god no matter how far they go in their life that seed still holds but the lawrence didn't come back because of brother homer he didn't come back because of me actually when he came back these boys were taking care of the church and i was preaching about once a weekend things were different it wasn't like it was years ago well why why was it like this well these boys had to grow up sometimes you just got to give it time that's kind of like adam you know he didn't court and do all different kind of crazy things he was just waiting for carly to grow up he didn't get nervous he was just waiting on her to grow up but you know you just can't blink and become 18 you you got to grow up you go sometimes you got to wait on them to grow up at that right brother joe you just got to wait
